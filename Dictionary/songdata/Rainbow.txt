I search for her in the dead of night  
A silhouette lit by candle light  
In a whispered word she is gone  
Familiar stranger without a name  
In a darkened room they all look the same  
Like the sands of time she slips away so far away  
In the mirror you can see her face  
An angel dressed in the blackest lace  
A sip of wine and the game can begin  
Just an image lost in fantasy  
Then you touch her and you can't break free  
Till you see your fate written there in her eyes  
Oh Ariel,  
Lost in a distant dream, take me home  
Ariel

I've got nothing in my head  
Got a floor for a bed  
My future's at the bottom of a tea cup  
  
I got a half a pair of shoes  
And no time to lose  
I'm wondering when I'm going to wise up  
  
So, fortune shine your light on me and my nose  
'Cause we need some security  
You get a little bad luck  
And it grows and it grows  
I'm the black sheep of the family  
  
I've got half a pound of rice  
A beard full of lice  
A condition called retrogression  
  
I've got pocket full of dust  
And eating is a must  
If you want to make a good impression  
  
So, fortune shine your light on me and my dog  
'Cause we need some security  
While all the folks are living high on high on the hog  
I'm the black sheep of the family  
  
Don't talk to me about society  
You got to play the rules  
Or pay the penalty  
  
Because there's nothing to choose  
Between a handful of blues  
Double indemnity  
  
The hour was wrong  
And my shadow's getting long  
My real life's a song, don't need much  
I've got an ache in my head  
I want to go to bed  
Tomorrow I don't have to wake up, no  
  
So wisdom shine your light on me and my knees  
'Cause it's true what they say about familiarity  
There's nothing good this way  
And it's true they say  
I'm the black sheep of the family  
  
Oh, my wisdom shine your light on me and my knees  
It's true what they say about familiarity  
There's nothing good this way  
And it's true they say  
I'm the black sheep of the family  
Yeah, yeah  
  
I'm the black sheep of the family  
Just me and my dog, yeah, yeah  
I'm the black sheep of the family  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
I'm the black sheep of the family  
You've got me on my knees  
I'm the black sheep of the family  
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I was taking a chance on a tight-rope  
Walking the line to the end  
I was ready to fall had my back to the wall  
But I'm flying again...  
I been shifting my gears. I been moving  
Cause they wanted me dead or alive  
But I'm making a break and I want you to take a ride  
Take a ride -  
Bring on the night  
Into the shadows and out of the light  
Bring on the night  
Let the dream chaser take you away  
  
When the sun hits another horizon...  
And the joker has started to deal...  
You can quit if you choose but there's nothing to lose  
By a spin of the wheel  
Gotta burn all your bridges behind you, they'll keep dragging  
You down if you stay...  
And I know I ain't wrong cause I'm free and I'm on my way  
On my way...  
Bring on the night  
Into the shadows and out of the light  
Bring on the night  
Let the dream chaser take you away  
  
I live on the edge of tomorrow  
I'm racing along on the wind  
I can see what I need, you better believe  
I'm playin' to win  
I got nothin' to fear when I'm flyin...  
Cause yesterday's over and gone  
And there's nothin' I can do... So I gotta keep movin' on..  
Movin' on -  
Movin' on -  
Bring on the night  
Into the shadows and out of the light  
Bring on the night  
Let the dream chaser take you away... Take you away  
Bring on the night  
"dream chaser"  
  
Repeat till fade

Contaminated fish and micro chips  
Huge supertankers on arabian trips  
Oily propaganda from the leaders' lips  
All about the future  
There's people over here, people over there  
Everybody's looking for a little more air  
Crossing all the borders just to take their share  
Planning for the future  
  
And we're so abused, and we're so confused  
It's easy to believe that someone's gonna light the fuse  
Can't happen here, can't happen here  
All that you fear they're telling you, can't happen here  
  
Supersonic planes for a holiday boom  
Rio de janeiro in an afternoon  
People out of work but there's people on the moon  
Looking for the future  
Concrete racktracks nationwide  
Juggernauts carving up the countryside  
Cars by the million on a one way ride  
Using up the future  
  
And we're so abused, and we're so confused  
It's easy to believe that someone's gonna light the fuse  
Can't happen here, can't happen here  
All that you fear they're telling you, can't happen here  
  
Satellites spying for the cia  
The kgb and the men in grey  
Wonder if I'm gonna see another day  
Somewhere in the future  
We got everything we need for a peaceful time  
Take what you want but you can't take mine  
Everybody's living on the siegfried line  
Worried 'bout the future  
And we're so abused, and we're so confused  
It's so easy to believe that someone's gonna light it  
Easy to believe someone's gonna light the fuse  
Can't happen here, can't happen here  
All that you fear they're telling you, can't happen here can it?

Day after day I keep waking up  
To find that you're slipping away  
Night after night  
I can't fight the emptiness inside  
Nothing I can say  
Now I know you're turning me away  
You're wearing a disguise  
You don't have to hide cause  
The truth is in your eyes tonight  
  
I don't want to live a lie  
But I don't want to say goodbye  
And I can't let you go even though it's over  
I just can't let you go  
Though your love is growing colder  
  
One look in my eyes and you'd realize  
That you got my heart in your hands  
Won't you let me know something more  
Where did we go wrong?  
  
I don't want to fight  
All I want to do is try to understand  
I'm reaching out for you babe  
What can I do  
I've been holding on so long  
I don't want to live a lie  
But I don't want to say goodbye  
I can't let you go  
Even though it's over  
I just can't let you go  
I feel your love is growing colder  
I don't want to live a lie  
But I don't want to say goodbye  
I want you by my side  
And I can't let you go  
Even though it's over  
I just can't let you go  
I feel your love is growing colder  
I can't let you go even though it's over

When evening falls  
She'll run to me  
Like whispered dreams  
Your eyes can't see  
  
Soft and warm  
She'll touch my face  
A bed of straw  
Against the lace  
  
We believed we'd catch the rainbow  
Ride the wind to the sun  
Sail away on ships of wonder  
  
But life's not a wheel  
With chains made of steel  
So bless me  
  
Come the dawn  
Come the dawn  
Come the dawn  
Come the dawn  
  
We believed we'd catch the rainbow  
Ride the wind to the sun  
And sail away on ships of wonder  
  
But life's not a wheel  
With chains made of steel  
So bless me, oh bless me, bless me  
  
Come the dawn  
Come the dawn  
Come the dawn  
Come the dawn

Shaking off the tresholds of a long forgotten dream  
And you just can't make it last  
Coaching paradise on a personal line  
But you get fired to fast  
And you lie, memories drifting by  
Love don't make it on those pin-striped nights  
When you're looking through someone's disguise  
You can't make it alone, so you gotta make a move  
But you're looking at nobody's eyes  
Well that's love, or maybe love come and go  
Looking for love is a danger zone  
Love don't go begging in the danger zone  
You won't get nothing from the danger zone  
Tales that you tell from the stories that you'll hear  
And you'll get what you can while you may  
Don't understand when you're looking for a dame  
But it's only a heartbreak away  
And you'll learn, faking has no return  
No way when you're feeling that way  
Will your feet get caught up in the crowd  
And the song that you sing is too soft to be heard  
But your speakers are way too loud  
Like the pain, loving is no big game  
Looking for love is a danger zone  
No don't go living in the danger zone  
You won't get nothing from the danger zone  
Don't take no chances in the danger zone  
Love don't go begging in the danger zone  
No don't go living in the danger zone  
You won't get nothing from the danger zone  
Don't take no chances in the danger zone  
Love don't go begging in the danger zone  
  

Rough and ready rider

Oh - you'll never win the race...  
As you turn and see his face...

Yesterday you were here by my side  
Nothing to prove and nothing left to hide  
You promised me there would be no goodbye  
But now I find another set of lies  
Babe you must be crazy  
How could you be so blind  
Why would you deceive me  
Now you're saying that you're leaving me behind  
So strong I'm not gonna run away  
Want you to know that I'm gonna break through  
How long can I go on this way  
There's nothing can I do  
  
Desperate hearts think you better hold out  
Turn apart I was left to bleed  
Don't start feeling you were sold out  
Now you better face reality  
  
Did my best, did the best that I could  
It's all been wanted just misunderstood  
You been on talking  
Your words are sounding so smooth  
Why don't you say it  
You just want to out me loose  
Oh don't say that you love me  
Don't want to hear that you tried  
Oh don't tell me that you need me  
Don't want to hear none of your alibis  
So strong I'm not gonna run away  
Want you to know I'm gonna break through  
How long can I go on this way  
There's nothing I can do  
  
Desperate hearts think you better hold out  
Turn apart I was left to bleed  
Don't start feeling you were sold out  
Now you better face reality  
  
So strong I'm not gonna run away  
Want you to know I'm gonna break through  
How long can I go on this way  
Tell me what can I do  
There's nothing I can do  
  
Desperate hearts think you better hold out  
Turn apart I was left to bleed  
Don't start feeling you were sold out  
Now you better face reality  
  
Desperate hearts think you better hold out  
Turn apart I was left to bleed  
Don't start feeling you were sold out  
Now you better face reality

Oh na na na na  
Mystery in me is something i can't see  
But i see you very well  
You slippy, cool, nobody's fool  
But there's something inside i can't tell  
  
I know a poor man, a rich man  
I know i can talk to a king  
But nobody here is gonna tell me  
I can't find out one thing  
  
I see your glow around you  
Open your arms 'cause i'm walking to you, come straight or through  
Maybe i'm wrong but i know it won't take long to see  
  
Do you close your eyes  
Do you close your eyes  
Do you close your eyes when you making love, yeah, yeah  
Making sweet love to me, yeah  
  
The logical friend said that i know in the end  
The things that make me smile  
To right from the start, i take the image of your heart  
And know it all the while  
  
I know a rich man, a poor man  
I know i can talk to a king, yeah  
So nobody here is gonna make me believe  
I can't find out one thing  
  
I see your glow around you  
Open your arms 'cause i'm coming, running, straight or through  
I could be wrong but i know it won't take long to see  
Do you close your eyes  
Do you close your eyes  
Do you close your eyes when you making love, yeah  
  
Do you close your eyes  
Do you close your eyes, i've gotta know  
Do you close your eyes when you making love

I never left like this before  
I think I'm gonna explode  
Had so much I couldn't take no more  
I'm heading for an overload  
Oh no here I go  
I can see the end  
Looked around and I heard the sound  
Of have one more my friend  
Drinking with the devil  
Gonna raise some hell  
I'm just a rock and roll rebel  
Got my soul to sell  
  
Out all night till the sun comes up  
You know I'm never gonna learn  
Raise my glass and fill my cup  
I'm playing with fire  
And I'm gonna get burned  
Like before he walked through the door  
A glass was in his hand  
Sat me down and poured me one more  
And I was drinking with the devil  
Gonna raise some hell  
I'm just a rock and roll rebel  
Got my soul to sell  
  
Out all night till the sun comes up  
You know I'm never gonna learn  
Raise my glass and fill my cup  
I'm playing with fire  
And I'm gonna get burned  
Like before he walked through the door  
A glass was in his hand  
Sat me down and poured me one more  
And said I'm at your command yes I am  
Drinking with the devil  
Gonna raise some hell  
I'm just a rock and roll rebel  
Got my soul to sell  
  
Drinking with the devil  
You know I had my fill  
Drinking with the devil  
And he sticks me with the bill

Hungry and wild she was born to the night  
A demon, a daughter of madness  
One look from her eyes could burn you alive  
Drown you in oceans of sadness  
Oh even the deadly shades of night  
Won't let me hide from her eyes of fire  
  
Face in the mirror we meet eye to eye  
Passions of eternal fire  
Desperately wanting and out of control  
Dancing on winds of desire  
Oh even the deadly shades of night  
Won't let me hide from her eyes of fire  
  
Curtain of darkness, screams of delight  
Taunts me with her sirens calling  
I got to be strong but I can't hang on  
Into the flames I am falling  
Oh even the deadly shades of night  
Won't let me hide (no, no, no, no)  
From her eyes of fire  
  
She keeps burning  
She keeps burning me, burning me, burning  
Me, burning me down  
Eyes of fire  
Oh no

Look away from the sea  
I can take you anywhere  
Spend a vision with me  
A chase with the wind  
  
Move closer to me  
I can make you anyone  
I think you're ready to see  
The gates of Babylon  
  
The power of what has been before  
Rises to trap you within  
A magic carpet ride a genie maybe more  
A city of heavenly sin  
Sleep with the devil and then you must pay  
Sleep with the devil and the devil will take you away  
Oh gates of Babylon  
  
You can see but you're blind  
Someone turned the sun around  
But you can see in your mind  
The gates of Babylon  
  
You're riding the endless caravan  
Bonded and sold as a slave  
A sabre dance removing all the veils  
Getting as good as you gave  
Sleep with the devil and then you must pay  
Sleep with the devil and the devil will take you away  
  
Look away from the sea  
I can take you anywhere  
Spend a vision with me  
A chase with the wind  
  
Move closer to me  
I can make you anyone  
I think you're ready to see  
The gates of Babylon  
  
The power of what has been before  
Rises to trap you within  
A magic carpet ride a genie maybe more  
A city of heavenly sin  
Sleep with the devil and then you must pay  
Sleep with the devil and the devil will take you away  
Black gates of Babylon  
  
The devil is me  
And I'm holding the key  
To the gates of sweet hell  
Babylon

I surrender to your heart babe  
Do anything that you want me to do  
Please be tender I'm in your hands girl  
This is a feeling I never knew  
You know I tried to make it on my own  
That's not the way it was meant to be  
Spend my time waiting by the phone  
Oh darling come back to me  
  
I surrender, I surrender  
I'm giving up the role of pretender  
Oh be tender, Girl be tender  
Can't you feel the love that I send her  
I surrender  
  
I remember, seems like a lifetime  
Can't believe it's a matter of days  
Since you left me I'm near to heartbreak  
I want you so bad don't turn away  
What does it take to stay by my side  
You know I'll do what you want me to  
Don't take away this feeling inside  
I'm still in love with you  
  
I surrender, I surrender  
I'm giving up the role of pretender  
I remember, I remember  
Can't you feel the love that I send her  
I surrender  
  
I surrender, I surrender  
Darling now won't you be tender  
Surrender, oh surrender  
Feel the love that I send her  
I surrender

You'd never know there was some music playin'  
Until you talked your way inside the door  
And then a sound like rollin' thunder  
Begins to push you right thru the floor  
  
And there's a great white sign  
With big black letters  
That just about explains it all  
  
If you don't like rock 'n' roll  
Well, if you don't like rock 'n' roll  
If you don't like rock 'n' roll  
Then it's too late now  
Well it's too late now  
  
Hey hey  
Of course there was the usual lady  
And she was dressed the way the stories tell  
So bein' cool I made a move to grab her  
But you could see she read story well  
  
And then she whipped out a card  
With big black letters  
That just about explained it all  
  
Well if you don't like rock 'n' roll  
If you don't like rock 'n' roll  
Well if you don't like rock 'n' roll  
Then you're too late now  
Then you're too late now  
  
Well, if you don't like rock 'n' roll  
Well, if you don't like rock 'n' roll, yeah  
If you don't like rock 'n' roll  
Well it's too late now  
Well you're too late now  
  
If you don't like rock 'n' roll  
If you don't like my rock 'n' roll  
Then you're too late now  
Then you're too late now  
Then you're too late, too late now

Lost and lonely  
Clouds hide the sun  
Out on the highway  
It's all hit and run  
  
Cold empty nights  
Demons in my head  
It's something I did  
Or baby something you said  
  
And it's hard to discover  
That you're just another  
Jealous Lover  
And its so tough to take  
  
But you're making no mistake  
Jealous Lover  
Oh Yeah  
Don't want no other  
  
Shades of red  
Eyes of green  
Sees black and white  
And there's no in between  
  
Ask me no questions  
I'll tell you no lies  
Still you keep thinking  
That it's all alibis  
  
And it's hard to discover  
You're like any other  
Jealous Lover  
And you're saying I'm a fake  
  
But you're making a mistake  
Oh, no no  
Every day it's the same  
The faces and the names  
  
How long can I go on  
Playing this game  
So I live for the nights  
Soft candle lights  
  
Today they love you  
Then tomorrow they might  
And it's hard to face  
Someone else takes your place  
  
Jealous Lover  
And they're saying that's the brakes  
But I got what it takes  
Jealous Lover, oh oh  
  
Jealous Lover  
Jealous Lover  
Don't need no, no no  
Don't need no other  
  
Jealous Lover, yeah  
Jealous Lover

Oh, carry home my broken bones and lay me down to rest  
Forty days of cries and moans I guess  
I've failed to pass the test  
I've been sent away not a thing to say  
I'm banished from the fold  
I'm a fallen angel who's lost his wings and left out in the cold  
  
Oh L.A. connection  
Oh L.A. connection  
L.A. connection, yeah  
  
Operator place a call keep secret but it through  
Investigator knows it all he's at the window I wonder who  
I've got to cut the line and let me drift find a haven in the storm  
I got no time I need a lift to where it's sweet and close and warm  
  
I say  
Oh L.A. connection  
Oh L.A. connection  
L.A. connection  
  
Hey, carry home my broken bones and lay me down to rest  
Forty days of cries and moans well I've just failed the test  
Feel I'm balanced on the brim should I lean another way  
Like a flame that's going on the dim needs blessing from the day, oh  
  
Oh L.A. connection, L.A. connection  
Oh take me away I got nothing to say  
It's got to be an L.A. connection, oh  
Oh L.A. connection, L.A. connection

Oh, L.A. connection, L.A. connection  
Oh, oh, L.A. connection, L.A.

At the end of a dream  
If you know where I mean  
When the mist just starts to clear  
  
In a similar way  
At the end of today  
I could feel the sound of writing on the wall  
It cries for you  
It's the least that you can do  
  
Like a spiral on the wind  
I can hear it screamin' in my mind  
  
Long live Rock and Roll  
Long live Rock 'n' Roll  
Long live Rock and Roll  
  
In a different time  
When the words didn't rhyme  
You could never quite be sure  
Then on with the change  
  
It was simple but strange  
And you knew the feeling seemed to say it all  
It cries for you  
It's the least that you can do  
  
Like a spiral on the wind  
I can hear it screamin' in my mind  
  
Long live Rock and Roll  
Long live Rock 'n' Roll  
Long live Rock and Roll  
  
If you suddenly see  
What has happened to me  
You should spread the word around  
  
And tell everyone here  
That it's perfectly clear  
They can sail above it all on what they've found  
It cries for you  
  
It's the best that you can do  
Like a sound that's everywhere  
I can hear it screaming through the air  
  
Long live Rock and Roll  
Long live Rock 'n' Roll  
Long live Rock and Roll

Got to get a message through  
'Cause I think I'm losing you  
Am I too late?  
Drinking habit's a loose sometime  
  
I got to know if you're still mine  
And I can't wait  
Last time I saw your face  
You tried to hide the tears  
  
But I could see the trace  
I'd be there if I could  
But it's so far away from home  
Lost in Hollywood  
  
In the dark the vultures wait  
I can hear them  
Knocking at my gate  
But I'm not here  
  
The brew was cold  
The meat is stale  
In the L.A. night the sirens wail  
The song you can feel  
  
Pale stars that never shine  
Scotch and the whiskey  
And the Rainbow local wine  
She's done more bad than good  
  
I gotta get away somehow  
Lost in Hollywood  
On the streets the sun is fine  
Don't you feel the advantage hit your mind  
  
Feels all right, oh yeah  
But I'm a lover  
Like a loaded gun  
Chasing shadows on the run  
  
Out in the night  
I'm gonna lose control  
If I been losing you  
To pay for rock'n'roll  
  
Get back I know I should  
Gotta get back home to you  
You don't know what I been through  
But there's nothing I can do, oh no  
  
Lost in Hollywood

Well I don't need much  
But I need a friend  
Or did you got time for me  
Ain't no trouble with you're always down  
To find a friend in misery  
But that's allright  
That's allright  
Ain't gonna fall for the line  
That's allright  
That's allright  
Don't need no sun to shine  
When love's no friend of mine  
I've been so down I've been on my knees  
Just don't seem to feel no pain  
Natural loser I've been on the run  
Got no shelter from the rain  
That's allright  
That's allright  
Ain't gonna fall for the line  
That's allright  
That's allright  
Don't need no sun to shine  
No cause love's no friend of mine  
Learn to live wether climb above my head  
Got no shame, got no pride  
If you need affection  
Don't knock on my door  
Got no feelings left inside  
But that's allright  
Yes, That's allright  
Ain't gonna fall for the line  
That's allright  
That's allright  
Don't need no sun to shine  
Cause love's no friend  
Cause love's no friend  
Ah no friend of mine  
Love's no friend of mine

There's a light in the sky  
That hangs on the edge of illusion  
Something very fine but it's something  
You know is there  
Mystery of time hidden by a man of confusion  
But the hand is quicker than the eye  
  
Only the stranger knows why  
'Cause it's magic  
You know it's magic that you'll find  
You see it's magic  
I know who you are there's magic in you  
  
Keep your eye on the man  
And don't look away for a moment  
How is it done how does he make me see  
Something up his sleeve when he speaks you want  
To believe him  
  
But the hand is quicker than the eye  
Only stranger knows why  
'Cause it's magic  
Can't you see it's magic that you'll find  
You know it's magic  
I know who you are 'cause there's magic in you  
  
Driven by a force  
Moving in another dimension  
Here for today, gone for eternity  
Seeking for truth  
Hidden by the word of his wisdom  
  
But the hand is quicker than the eye  
Only the stranger knows why  
Can't you feel it's magic  
You know it's magic that you'll find  
I said it's magic  
I know who you are 'cause there's magic in you

Through the smoke of dancers move  
Demonic dirty downtown groove  
Visions of the day retreat  
Come on baby feel the heat  
  
Then I can disappear  
And be at peace  
But when my mind is clear  
I can't get no release  
  
In the dark the dancers shout  
Scream the cry of freedom out  
Strobe crescendos in the night  
Minds take cover, souls take flight  
  
Oh let me disappear  
Set me free, set me free  
But when my mind is clear  
I can't get no release  
  
Set me free, set me free baby  
Well I can feel it yeah  
I can feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it.

The other family gets no sleep  
Somewhere down the love got to take and keep  
Think about the future, nothing in the past  
God, things never last  
  
Come on, come on, come on  
Take your love  
Get down, get down, get down  
Down the road  
  
It ain't no lie  
You're hurting  
And you don't know why  
No time to lose  
We get no time to lose  
No time to lose  
No time to lose  
  
Ever had the feeling something's going wrong?  
Hanging 'round a lover where you don't belong  
Waiting for a reason, lookin' for a clue  
But you know what you gotta do  
  
Come on, come on, come on  
Take your love  
Get down, get down, get down  
Down the road  
  
It ain't no lie  
You're hurting  
And you don't know why  
You got no time to lose  
We get no time to lose  
No time to lose  
No time to lose  
  
Your brother's at the bar  
Three girls in the car  
Your sister's on the telephone  
That ain't low  
Your mother's going blue  
Your dad is going gray  
There's nothing here for you to stay  
  
Come on, come on, come on  
Take your love  
Get down, get down, get down  
Get down that road, get down you  
  
It ain't no lie  
You're hurting  
And you don't know why  
No time to lose  
No time to lose  
You gonna have to choose  
You go and shake the blues  
You got no time to lose  
You got to choose  
No time to lose

In the light of the day  
You can hear the old ones say  
Was the sound last night the wind?  
Can you feel the change begin?  
  
By the fall of the snow  
A single soul will go  
The footsteps on the white  
There's an unholy light  
  
There's a hole in the sky  
Something evil's passing by  
What's to come - when the siren calls you go  
To run with the wolf  
  
When the world makes a turn  
The eyes of one will learn  
That a sound just like the wind  
Only makes the change begin  
  
By the end of the rain  
The feelings passed again  
From things that snap and bite  
An unholy light  
  
There's a hole in the sky  
Something evil's passing by  
What's to come - when the siren calls you go  
To run with the wolf  
  
There's a break in the ground  
Like the swirling water's angry as they pull you down  
  
When the siren calls you go, yeah  
To run with the wolf  
Run with the wolf  
  
There's a hole in the sky  
Something evil is passing by  
What's to come - when the siren calls you go, yeah  
To run with the wolf  
Run with the wolf  
  
Like a beast in a field  
He knows his fate is sealed  
He runs with the wolf, oh oooh  
  
Run with the wolf  
  
See the break, you know it's the same(?)  
Now he goes  
To run, run, run  
Run, run, run, run  
  
Run with the wolf  
Run with the wolf  
Run with the wolf  
Run with the wolf  
Run, run, run  
Now we go run, run, run, run  
Run with the wolf  
All right  
Run with the wolf  
Run with the wolf

Paint me a picture  
And hand it on the wall  
Colour it darkly  
The lines must start to crawl  
Down, down, down  
  
Spin me around and around  
Draw me away  
To the night from the day  
Leave not a trace to be found  
Down, down  
  
Nothing is real  
But the way that I feel  
And I feel like going  
Down, down...  
  
Paint me a picture  
Of eyes that never see  
With flasks of lightning  
That burn for only me  
Hey, hey, hey  
  
There's only the devil to pay  
I'm ready to go  
Pull me down from below  
Give me a place I can lay  
Hey, hey  
  
Nothing is real  
But the way that I feel  
And I feel like going down Refrain  
Down, down...

I was feelin' rather good  
Should've touched some wood  
Here she comes again  
Reachin' out to bend my ear  
  
She's worth another look  
All the time it took  
Pleasin' to the eye  
How can I just disappear, oh  
It ain't clear, no  
She's a bright and shining star  
But I just must be sensitive to light  
Oh I just might, yeah  
  
I could have let her in  
Give her just a spin  
Let her think it's love  
Better rise above it all  
  
She's knockin' at the door  
Seems to want some more  
Never gets the clue  
What am I to do she'll fall  
And she might call, oh no  
She's a bright and shining star  
But I just must be sensitive to light  
Oh, I just know  
  
She could do me well  
I can always tell  
She's ready for the kill  
But I think that I will go, no  
  
Sure I'm gonna see  
Something just for me  
'Til it comes along  
When it's feelin' wrong I'll know  
Gotta take it slow, yeah  
  
She's a bright and shining star  
But I just must be sensitive to light  
Oh, I might, yeah  
  
She's a bright and blazing star  
But I just must be sensitive to light, yeah  
Sensitive to light, oh

I'm like a freight train feelin' no pain  
I never turn back one track  
Better step aside  
  
Like a shotgun  
I'm really someone  
You'll feel my heatwave  
Won't save anyone near to me  
  
I'm steel  
So come and try to bend me if you can, hah  
I don't feel  
Before you know it it's over  
Get out of my way  
I'm street walking, street walking  
Night stalking, I'm street walking  
  
No reputation  
You better quick run  
Cause I got no time I'll climb all over you  
  
You need a strong hand  
To be a mean man  
You've got to think fast  
I'll last longer than you could know  
  
I'm steel  
So won't you come and try to bend me if you can  
I don't feel  
Before you know it it's over  
Out of my way  
I'm street walking  
  
Hey, I'm a wild cat  
Don't need to prove that  
I'm always howlin' prowlin'  
Stalkin' my prey  
  
It could be your night  
To feel the dog bite  
And hear the slashing, crashin'  
Tearin' inside of you  
  
I'm steel  
So come and try to break me if you can, no way  
Like a wheel  
About to roll you over  
Get out of my way  
I'm street walkin', street walkin'  
No talkin', street walking  
Night stalking, street walking  
No talkin', I'm street walkin', yeah  
Street walkin', street walkin'  
Night stalking, street walking

I get the same old dreams same time every night  
Fall to the ground and I wake up  
So I get out of bed, put on my shoes and in my head  
Thoughts fly back to the breakup  
  
These four wall are closing in  
Look at the fix you put me in  
  
Since you been gone  
Since you been gone  
I'm out of my head can't take it  
Could I be wrong  
But since you been gone  
You cast your spell so break it  
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh  
Since you been gone  
  
So in the night I stand beneath the backstreet light  
I read the words that you sent to me  
I can take the afternoon, the night time comes around  
too soon  
You can't know what you mean to me  
  
Your poison letter, your telegram  
Just goes to show you don't give a damn  
  
Since you been gone  
Since you been gone  
I'm out of my head can't take it  
Could I be wrong  
But since you been gone  
You cast your spell so break it  
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh  
Since you been gone  
  
If you will come back  
Baby, you know you'll never do wrong  
  
Since you been gone  
Since you been gone  
I'm out of my head can't take it  
Could I be wrong  
But since you been gone  
You cast your spell so break it  
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh  
Ever since you been gone  
  
Since you been gone  
Since you been gone  
I'm out of my head can't take it  
Since you been gone  
Since you been gone  
I'm out of my head can't take it

It's only been an hour  
Since he locked her in the tower  
The time has come  
He must be undone  
By the morning  
  
Many times before  
The tyrant's opened up the door  
Then someone cries  
Still we close our eyes  
Not again  
  
Meet me when the sun is in the western skies  
The fighting must begin before another someone dies  
Cross bows in the fire light  
Green sleeves waving  
Madmen raving  
Through the shattered night  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
Flames are getting higher  
Make it leap unto the spire  
Draw bridge down  
Cut it to the ground  
We shall dance around the fire  
  
No more night  
We have seen the light  
Let it shine on bright  
Hang him higher, higher  
  
Draw bridge down  
Cut it to the ground  
We shall dance all around the fire, around the fire  
  
No more night  
we've seen the light  
let it shine on bright  
  
Hang him higher, higher  
Put the man on the fire  
  
Draw bridge down  
Cut it to the ground  
We gotta dance around the fire, the fire, the fire

You don't know what's happenin' you want to go home  
But there's nowhere to hide  
You walk out on stage, your first time alone  
The crowd's going wild  
  
And you feel so alive  
You could stand up and take this all night  
They love you, but you're in love with the spotlight  
You're the spotlight kid  
  
Jokers and women they hang 'round your door  
They're all part of the scene  
Just like a junkie you've got to have more  
It's a pleasure machine  
  
And you fly every night  
But the dressing room mirror don't lie  
They love you, but you're in love with the spotlight  
You're the spotlight kid  
  
Your audience died, faded away  
It's been so many years since that first matinee  
It seems like an age  
Encore one more time  
  
For the ghosts of the part in your mind  
They love you, but you're in love with the spotlight  
  
You're the spotlight kid  
You're living in a dream  
You're the spotlight kid  
You're in love with the spotlight

See the stars come fallin' down from the sky  
Gently passing, they kiss your tear drops dry  
See the wind come, softly blow  
Your hair from your face  
And the rain comes falling down  
In its crazy way  
Still I'm sad  
  
For myself my tears just fall in the dust  
As I search in the night and find they're lost  
See the wind come gently blow  
Time into my heart  
And the rain comes falling down  
While we're apart  
Still I'm sad

Every night I have the same old dream  
'Bout you and me and what's in between  
So many changes, so many lies  
Try to run, try to hide  
  
From everything that I feel inside  
But I can't escape you or your frozen eyes  
Searching in the darkness  
Fading out of sight  
  
Love was here and gone like a thief in the night  
Stone Cold  
And I thought I knew you so well  
Stone Cold  
  
Can't break away from your spell  
Another dark and empty night  
If I was wrong I want to make it right  
But you are so distant, so far away  
  
Your words like ice fall on the ground  
Breaking the silence without a sound  
Oh familiar strangers with nothing to say  
Searching in the darkness  
  
Fading out of sight  
Love was here and gone like a thief in the night  
Stone Cold  
And I thought I knew you so well  
  
Stone Cold  
Can't break away from your spell  
You leave me Stone Cold  
Searching in the darkness  
  
Fading out of sight  
Love was here and gone like a thief in the night  
Stone Cold  
And I thought I knew you so well  
  
Stone Cold  
Can't break away from your spell  
You're Stone Coldyeah  
I can't break away from your spell  
  
Stone Cold baby  
I thought I knew you so well  
You're stone coldice cold  
Can't break away from your spell  
  
(You put me in the deep freeze)  
(Oh baby don't you leave me)  
(Stone cold, your leavin' me cold)  
Stone Cold, I thought I knew you so well  
  
Stone Cold, xan't break away from your spell

Dog night I'm so alone  
A million miles out on my own  
No one to talk no one to care  
Searching for someone they could be anywhere  
Magic and madness it's so very strange  
Soemtimes I think it's all pre-arranged  
That same old feeling hits me again  
Just the beginning but its feels like the end  
Oh feel like I'm stranded out here  
Oh I think I might disappear  
No don't leave me stranded out here  
Oh it's just the loneliness I fear  
  
Lonely window fading star  
You never felt so near yet so far  
Tried to forget you the best that I could  
Don't try to find me it won't do any good  
I'm caught in a dream so hard to locate  
I'm just a captive of my own fate  
No turning back no not tonight  
You're moving on way out of sight  
Oh feel like I'm stranded out here  
Oh I think I might disappear  
No don't leave me stranded out here  
Oh it's just the loneliness I fear  
Stranded (8 times)  
Oh I feel like I'm stranded out here  
Same as before  
Stranded...

I don't want to go  
Something tells me no, no, no, no  
But traces in the sand  
The lines that set my hand  
Say go, go, go  
  
Beware of a place  
A smile of a bright shining face  
  
I'll never return, how do you know?  
Tarot woman  
I don't know  
I don't know  
  
She can take you there  
The entrance to the fair  
Mine, mine, mine  
  
Ride the carousel  
And cast a magic spell  
You can fly, fly  
  
Beware of a place  
A smile of a bright shining face  
  
I'll never return, how do you know?  
Tarot woman, well I don't know  
I don't know  
I don't know  
I don't know  
  
Something in the air  
Tells me to beware, no, no, no  
Her love is like a knife  
She'll carve away your life  
So go, go, go  
  
Beware of a place  
A smile of a bright shining face  
  
I'll never return, how do you know?  
Tarot woman, I don't know  
I don't know  
I don't know  
Hey, I don't know

First time I saw your face  
By your side was the place  
That I would wanna be  
Sometimes and I don't know why  
Love can come or it can pass you by  
Now you take all the love you gave to me  
(you take it from me)  
You're tearin' out my heart  
Oh  
Never thought I'd see the day  
You would throw my love away  
And oh, it's killing me  
One thing you'll never know  
How it hurts to let you go  
As you turn and walk away from me  
(walk away)  
You're tearin' out my heart  
Feel like I been ripped apart  
You're tearin' out my heart  
  
Daybreaks I try to be free  
But your memory is haunting me  
Oh , there's nothing I can do  
All alone in the candlelight  
I see your face again tonight  
And I feel all the emptiness without you  
(without you) tearin' out my heart  
Oh, I feel like I been ripped apart  
Tearin' out my heart  
Whoa, my heart

One day in the year of the fox  
Came a time remembered well  
When the strong young man of the rising sun  
Heard the tolling of the great black bell  
  
One day in the year of the fox  
When the bell began to ring  
Meant the time had come  
For one to go  
To the temple of the king  
  
There in the middle of the circle he stands  
Searching, seeking  
With just one touch of his trembling hand  
The answer will be found  
  
Daylight waits while the old man sings  
Heaven help me  
And then like the rush of a thousand wings  
It shines upon the one  
And the day had just begun  
  
One day in the year of the fox  
Came a time remembered well  
When the strong young man of the rising sun  
Heard the tolling of the great black bell  
  
One day in the year of the fox  
When the bell began to sing  
It meant the time had come  
For one to go  
To the temple of the king  
  
There in the middle of the people  
He stands  
Seeing, feeling  
With just a wave of a strong right hand  
He's gone  
To the temple of the king  
  
Far from the circle at the edge of the world  
He's hoping, wondering  
Thinking back from the stories he's heard  
Of what he's going to see  
  
There in middle of the circle it lies  
Heaven help me  
Then all could see by the shine in his eyes  
The answer had been found  
  
Back with the people in the circle  
He stands  
Giving, feeling  
With just one touch of a strong right hand  
They know  
Of the temple and the king
