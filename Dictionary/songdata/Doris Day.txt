A chocolate sundae on a Saturday night

The moo-oon was fine, the dancin' divine  
Let's head for the drug store at Maple and Vine  
  
Couples swayin' to a nickel machine  
There's a corner where we'll never be seen  
It's lovely to share that lover's delight  
A chocolate sundae on a Saturday night

There's pistachio, and lemon pie  
They've got a special sundae with a cherry on top

A chocolate sundae on a Saturday night

The moo-oon was fine, the dancin' divine  
Let's head for the drug store at Maple and Vine

I walked down the street like a good girl should  
He followed me down the street like I knew he would  
Because a guy is a guy wherever he may be  
So listen and I'll tell you what this fella did to me  
I walked to my house like a good girl should  
He followed me to my house like I knew he would  
Because a guy is a guy wherever he may be  
So listen while I tell you what this fella did to me  
I never saw the boy before  
So nothin' could be sillier  
At closer range his face was strange  
But his manner was familiar  
So I walked up the stairs like a good girl should  
He followed me up the stairs like I knew he would  
Because a guy is a guy wherever he may be  
So listen and I'll tell you what this fella did to me  
I stepped to my door like a good girl should  
He stopped at my door like I knew he would  
Because a guy is a guy wherever he may be  
So listen while I tell you what this fella did to me  
He asked me for a good-night kiss  
I said, "It's still good day"  
I would have told him more except  
His lips got in the way  
So I talked to my ma like a good girl should  
And Ma talked to Pa like I knew she would  
And they all agreed on a married life for me  
The guy is my guy wherever he may be  
So I walked down the aisle like a good girl should  
He followed me down the aisle like I knew he would  
Because a guy is a guy wherever he may be  
And now you've heard the story of what someone did to me  
And that's what he did to me  

Once I had a secret love  
That lived within the heart of me  
All too soon my secret love  
Became impatient to be free  
  
So I told a friendly star  
The way that dreamers often do  
Just how wonderful you are  
And why I am so in love with you  
  
Now I shout it from the highest hills  
Even told the golden daffodils  
  
At last my heart's an open door  
And my secret love's no secret anymore

This couldn't happen again  
This is that once in a lifetime  
This is the thrill divine  
What's more, this never happened before  
Though I have prayed for a lifetime  
That such as you would suddenly be mine  
Mine to hold as I"m holding you now and yet never so near  
Mine to have when the now and the here disappear  
What matters, dear, for when  
This doesn't happen again  
We'll have this moment forever  
But never, never, again  
  
Again, this couldn't happen again  
This is that once in a lifetime  
This is the thrill divine  
What's more, this never happened before  
Though I have prayed for a lifetime  
That such as you would suddenly be mine  
Mine to hold as I"m holding you now and yet never so near  
Mine to have when the now and the here disappear  
What matters, dear, for when  
This doesn't happen again  
We'll have this moment forever  

Can't tell you the truth  
'Least I don't lie about that  
Kind of comfort in you  
Comes when you lie right back  
  
Safe from such a strange point of view  
To hear your own words on you  
  
How much do you go to be gone?  
You are any way the wind blows  
Any way the wind blows in  
  
Don't wanna come down too low  
Any way the wind blows  
Any way the wind blows in  
Any way the wind blows in  
  
Similar creatures we are  
Chasing the pipe dream down  
Love elusive so far  
Keeps us divided now  
  
Go, go on and write me love songs  
So I have something to sing when your gone  
  
How much do you go to be gone?  
You are any way the wind blows  
Any way the wind blows in  
  
Don't wanna come down too low  
Any way the wind blows  
Any way the wind blows in  
  
Don't wanna come down  
Do you know the way  
To be in one place but sway?  
Anyway the wind's blowin'  
  
You are love, you are love  
You are monsters and angels  
Untouched, unseen  
  
All in one, all in one  
I take all that you are  
'Cause you're just like me  
But you move and it's hard  
To stay close to a satellite  
  
So I lose sight of you  
Till you come round again  
I'm watching the wind  
  
Hey ay, hey ay, ay  
Anyway the wind's blowin'  
  
How much do you go to be gone?  
You are any way the wind blows  
Any way the wind blows in  
  
Don't wanna come down too low  
Any way the wind blows  
Any way the wind blows in  
  
Don't wanna come down  
Do you know the way  
To be in one place but stay?  
Any way the wind's blowin'  
Any way the wind's blowin'

April in Paris  
Chestnuts in blossoms  
Holiday tables  
Under the trees  
April in Paris  
This is a feeling  
No one can ever  
Reprieve  
  
I never knew the charm of spring  
Never met it face to face  
I never new my heart could sing  
Never missed a warm embrace  
  
'Till April in Paris  
Whom can I run to  
What have you done to  
My heart...  
  
I never knew the charm of spring  
Never met it face to face  
I never new my heart could sing  
Never missed a warm embrace  
  
'Till April in Paris  
Whom can I run to  
What have you done to  
My... hear-eart...

Baby doll, you wonderful baby doll  
Let's go home and tell my mother  
That I found a baby brother  
  
I am taking you off the shelf  
And showing you off myself  
  
Can't you see it now?  
You're taking me walkin'  
Holding my hand  
Oh honey, there's no use talkin'  
You're a wonderful baby doll  
  
I am taking you off the shelf  
And showing you off myself  
  
Can't you see it now  
You're taking me walkin'  
Holding my hand  
Oh honey, there's no use talkin'  
You're a wonderful baby doll  
  
A wonderful baby doll

After one whole quart of brandy,  
Like a daisy I'm awake.  
With no Bromo Seltzer handy,  
I don't even shake.  
  
Men are not a new sensation,  
I've done pretty well I think,  
But this half pint imitation  
Put me on the blink.  
  
I'm wild again, beguiled again  
A whimpering, simpering child again  
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I.  
  
Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep  
When love came and told me, I shouldn't sleep.  
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I.  
  
I lost my heart, but what of it, he is cold I agree  
He might laugh, but I love it, although the laugh's on me.  
  
I'll sing to him, bring spring to him  
And long, for the day when I'll cling to him.  
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I.  
  
He's a fool and don't I know it,  
But a fool can have his charms,  
I'm in love and don't I know it,  
Like a babe in arms.  
  
Love's the same old sad sensation,  
Lately I've not slept a wink,  
Since this half pint imitation,  
Put me on the blink.  
  
I've sinned a lot, I mean a lot,  
But I'm like sweet seventeen a lot,  
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I.  
  
I'll sing to him, each spring to him,  
And worship the trousers that cling to him.  
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I.  
  
When he talks, he is seeking,  
Words to get,.off his chest.  
Horizontally speaking  
He's at his very best.  
  
Vexed again, perplexed again,  
Thank god I can be oversexed again.  
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I.  
  
Wise at last, my eyes at last,  
Are cutting you down to your size at last,  
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, no more.  
  
Burned a lot but learned a lot,  
And now you are broke so you earned a lot,  
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, no more.  
  
Couldn't eat, was dyspeptic,  
Life was so hard to bear,  
Now my heart's antiseptic,  
Since you moved out of there.  
  
Romance finis.  
Your chance finis.  
Those ants that invaded my pants finis.  
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, no more.

Take me back to the black hills  
The black hills of Dakota  
To the beautiful Indian country  
That I love  
  
Lost my heart in the black hills  
The black hills of Dakota  
Where the pines are so high  
That they kiss the sky above  
  
And when I get that lonesome feelin'  
And I'm miles away from home  
I hear the voice of the mystic mountains  
Callin' me back home  
  
So take me back to the black hills  
The black hills of Dakota  
To the beautiful Indian country  
That I love  
  
And when I get that lonesome feelin'  
And I'm miles away from home  
I hear the voice of the mystic mountains  
Callin' me back home  
  
So take me back to the black hills  
The black hills of Dakota  
To the beautiful Indian country  
That I love  
  
To the beautiful Indian country  
That I love  
  
Take me back to the Black Hills  
To the beautiful Indian country that I love

Blue skies  
Smiling at me  
Nothing but blue skies  
Do I see  
  
Bluebirds  
Singing a song  
Nothing but bluebirds  
All day long  
  
Never saw the sun shining so bright  
Never saw things going so right  
Noticing the days hurrying by  
When you're in love, my how they fly  
  
Blue days  
All of them gone  
Nothing but blue skies  
From now on  
  
Nothing but blue skies  
Do I see  
  
Bluebirds  
Singing a song  
Nothing but bluebirds  
All day long  
  
Never saw the sun shining so bright  
Never saw things going so right  
Noticing the days hurrying by  
When you're in love, my how they fly  
  
Blue days  
All of them gone  
Nothing but blue skies  
From now on

By the light of the silvery moon  
I want to spoon  
To my honey I'll croon love's tune  
Honey moon, keep a-shinin' in June  
Your silvery beams will bring love's dreams  
We'll be cuddlin' soon  
By the silvery moon  
  
Place - park, scene - dark  
Silvery moon is shining through the trees  
Cast - two, me - you  
Summer kisses floating on the breeze  
Act one, be done  
Dialog - where would ya like to spoon?  
My cue, with you  
Underneath the silvery moon  
  
By the light of the silvery moon  
I want to spoon  
To my honey I'll croon love's tune  
Honey moon, keep a-shinin' in June  
Your silvery beams will bring love's dreams  
We'll be cuddlin' soon by the silvery moon  
  
Act two, Scene - new  
Roses blooming all around the place  
Cast - three, You - me  
Preacher with a solemn-looking face  
Choir sings, bell rings  
Preacher: You are wed forever more  
Act two, all though  
Every night the same encore  
  
By the light, not the dark but the light  
Of the silvery moon, not the sun but the moon  
I want to spoon, not croon, but spoon  
To my honey I'll croon love's tune  
Honeymoon, honey moon, honey moon  
Keep a-shinin' in June  
Your silvery beams will bring love's dreams  
We'll be cuddlin' soon  
By the silvery moon  
The silvery moon...

Heaven, I'm in heaven  
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak  
And I seem to find the happiness I seek  
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek  
Heaven, I'm in heaven  
  
And the cares that hung around me through the week  
Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak  
When we're out together dancing (Swinging) cheek to cheek  
Oh I love to climb a mountain  
And reach the highest peak  
But it doesn't thrill (Boot) me half as much  
As dancing cheek to cheek  
Oh I love to go out fishing  
In a river or a creek  
  
But I don't enjoy it half as much  
As dancing cheek to cheek  
(Come on and) Dance with me  
I want my arms around you  
That (Those) charm about you  
Will carry me through  
  
(Right up) To heaven, I'm in heaven  
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak  
And I seem to find the happiness I seek  
When we're out together dancing, out together dancing (Swinging)  
Out together dancing cheek to cheek

Oh the Deadwood Stage is a-rollin' on over the plains  
With the curtains flappin' and the driver slappin' the reins  
A beautiful sky, a wonderful day  
Whip crack-away, whip crack-away, whip crack-away  
Oh the Deadwood Stage is a-headin' on over the hills  
Where the Injun arrows are thicker than porcupine quills  
Dangerous land, no time to delay  
So whip crack-away, whip crack-away, whip crack-away  
We're headin' straight for town, loaded down  
With a fancy cargo, care of Wells and Fargo, Illinois - Boy!  
Oh the Deadwood Stage is a-comin' on over the crest  
Like a homin' pigeon that's a-hankerin' after it's nest  
Twenty-three miles we've covered today  
So whip crack-away, whip crack-away, whip crack-away  
The wheels go turnin' round, homeward bound  
Can't you hear 'em hummin'  
Happy times are comin' for to stay - hey!  
We'll be home tonight by the light of the silvery moon  
And my heart's a-thumpin' like a mandolin a-plunkin' a tune  
When I get home, I'm fixin' to stay  
So whip crack-away, whip crack-away, whip crack-away  
Whip crack-away, whip crack-away, whip crack-away...  
Introducin' Henry Miller, just as busy as a fizzy sarsparilla  
Ain't a showman and he's smarter, operates the Golden Garter  
Where the cream of Deadwood City come to dine  
And I'm glad to say he's a very good friend of mine  
Hi Joe, say where d'you get them fancy clothes  
I know, off some fella's laundry line  
Hi Beau, aren't you the Prairie Rose  
Smellin' like a watermelon vine  
Here's the man the Sheriff watches  
On his gun there's more than twenty-seven notches  
On the draw there's no-one faster and you're flirtin' wit

Stars shining bright above you  
Night breezes seem to whisper "I love you"  
Birds singing in the sycamore trees  
Dream a little dream of me  
  
Say "nighty night" and kiss me  
Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me  
While I'm alone and blue as can be  
Dream a little dream of me  
  
Stars fading but I linger on, dear  
Still craving your kiss  
I'm longing to linger till dawn, dear  
Just saying this  
  
Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you  
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you  
But in your dreams, whatever they be  
Dream a little dream of me

Everybody loves a lover  
I'm a lover, everybody loves me  
Anyhow, that's how I feel  
Wow, I feel just like a Pollyanna  
  
I should worry, not for nothin'  
Everybody loves me, yes they do  
And I love everybody  
Since I fell in love with you  
  
Who's the most popular personality?  
I can't help thinkin' it's no one else but me  
Gee, I feel just about ten feet tall, havin' a ball  
Guess ya might call me a Pollyanna  
  
Everybody loves a lover  
  
I should worry, not for nothin'  
Everybody loves me, yes they do  
And I love everybody  
Since I fell in love with  
Fell in love with  
Fell in love with you...  
  
(Call me a Pollyanna, do)

Everybody loves my baby  
But my baby don't love nobody but me  
Nobody but me  
Yes  
Everybody wants my baby  
But my baby don't want nobody but me  
That's plain to see!  
  
I'm his sweet Judy  
And he is my loving man!  
No time to do his duty  
Loves me like no other can!  
  
Everybody loves my baby  
But my baby don't love nobody but me  
Nobody but me  
Everybody wants my baby  
But my baby don't want nobody but me  
That's plain to see!  
  
Now when my baby kisses me  
Upon my rosy cheeks -  
I just let those kisses be  
Don't wash my face for weeks!  
  
Everybody loves my baby...

Here comes Santa Claus,  
Here comes Santa Claus,  
Right down Santa Claus Lane,  
Vixen and Blitzen and all his reindeer  
Pullin' on the reins.  
Bells are ringin', children singin',  
All is merry and bright.  
So hang your stockings and say your prayers,  
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight.  
Here comes Santa Claus,  
Here comes Santa Claus,  
Right down Santa Claus Lane,  
He's got a bag that's filled with toys  
For boys and girls again.  
Hear those sleigh bells jingle jangle,  
Oh what a beautiful sight,  
So jump in bed, and cover your head,  
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight.  
[musical interlude]  
Here comes Santa Claus,  
Here comes Santa Claus,  
Right down Santa Claus Lane,  
He'll come around when chimes ring out,  
It's Christmas time again.  
Peace on earth will come to all,  
If we just follow the light,  
So let's give thanks to the Lord above  
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight.

I know a dark secluded place  
A place where no one knows your face.  
A glass of wine, a fast embrace.  
Its called Hernandos Hideaway. Ole!  
  
All you see are silhouettes  
And all you hear are castanets  
And no one cares how late it gets  
Not at Hernandos Hideaway. Ole!  
  
INSTRUMENTAL  
At the golden finger bowl or anyplace you go  
  
INSTRUMENTAL  
you'll meet your uncle Max and everyone you know  
  
INSTRUMENTAL  
But if you are sitting close and making love to me  
you may take my heart, you may take my soul, but not my key  
  
Just knock three times and whisper low  
That you and I were sent by Joe  
Then strike a match and you will know  
you're in Hernandos Hideaway. Ole!

Hooray for Hollywood  
That screwy, ballyhooey Hollywood  
Where any office boy or young mechanic  
Can be a panic, with just a goodlooking pan  
Where any barmaid can be a star maid  
If she dances with or without a fan  
  
Hooray for Hollywood  
Where you're terrific, if you're even good  
Where anyone at all from TV's Lassie  
To Monroe's chassis is equally understood  
Go out and try your luck, you might be Donald Duck  
Hooray for Hollywood  
  
Hooray for Hollywood  
That phoney, super coney Hollywood  
They come from Chillicothes and Padukahs  
With their bazookas to get their names up in lights  
All armed with photos from local rotos  
With their hair in ribbons and legs in tights  
  
Hooray for Hollywood  
You may be homely in your neighborhood  
But if you think that you can an actor  
See Mr. Factor, he'd make a monkey look good  
With a half an hour, you'll look like Tyrone Power  
Hooray for Hollywood

In a dream the strangest and the oddest things appear  
And what insane and silly things we do  
Here is what I see before me, vividly and clear  
As I recall it, you were in it, too  
  
I had the craziest dream last night, yes I did  
I never dreamt it could be  
Yet there you were, in love with me  
I found your lips close to mine so I kissed you  
And you didn't mind it at all  
When I'm awake such a break never happens  
How long can a gal go on dreaming?  
  
If there's a chance that you care  
Then, please, say you do, Baby  
Say it and make my craziest dream come true

I'll be home this Christmas  
This time for sure  
To have and hold you baby  
Hold you in my arms  
  
I'll be home this Christmas  
This time for sure  
I'll be there to comfort you  
Hold you for ever more  
  
Lovin' you so tenderly  
Oh just you wait and see  
My heart will be for ever more  
Yours till eternity  
  
I'll be home this Christmas  
For sure this time  
You're everything I dreaming of  
I'll be home this Christmas time  
  
I'll be home this Christmas  
This time for sure  
To have and hold you baby  
Forever this Christmas time  
  
You're everything I dreaming of  
I'll be home this Christmas time  
Forever this Christmas time  
I'll be home this Christmas time

(I love the way  
You say goodnight)  
I kinda like the way  
You mumble  
While you fumble for the key  
More time for kissing me  
(I love the way  
You say goodnight)  
I kinda like the way you  
Linger with your finger  
On the bell  
More kisses  
And they're swell  
When you say  
Gotta get home by twelve  
I always say let's go  
'Cuz you can take longer  
To say good night  
Than any three others I know  
(Both)  
I love the way  
You say goodnight  
I kinda like the way  
You snuggle  
While you juggle  
With your comb  
Mmmmmm  
I'm never  
Never, never going home  
  
I love the way  
(I kinda like the way)  
You say  
(The way you always say)  
Goodnight  
(The way you always  
Whisper honey nighty night)  
The way  
You let our kisses mingle  
'Til I tingle to my toes  
(Giggle  
We're blushing like a rose)  
I love the way  
(I kinda like the way  
The extraordinary way)  
You say good night  
(The way you always say  
Don't go just hold me tight)  
I kinda like the way you giggle  
While you jiggle with your bag  
(Sign  
Our heart's are playing tag)  
When you say  
(We just got to be home by twelve)  
But don't I always say let's go  
'Cause you take longer  
To say good night  
Than any three others I know  
I love the way  
(I kinda like the way) you say  
(The super duper special way)  
Goodnight  
(The way you have me flying  
Higher than a kite)  
I kinda like the way you snuggle  
While you juggle with your comb  
(It looks as though  
You're never going)  
No I'm never, never, never  
Never, never, never gonna go home

I may be wrong but I think you're wonderful  
I may be wrong but I think you're swell  
I like your style say, I think it's marvellous  
I'm always wrong so how can I tell  
Deuces to me are all aces  
Life is to me just a bore  
Faces are all open spaces  
You might be John Barrymore  
You came along say I think you're wonderful  
I think you're grand but I may be wrong  
  
I may be wrong but I think you're wonderful  
I may be wrong but I think you're swell  
I like your style say, I really think it's marvellous  
I'm always wrong so how can I tell  
Deuces to me are all aces  
Life is to me just a bore  
Faces are all open spaces  
You might be John Barrymore  
You came along say I think you're wonderful  
I think you're grand but I may be wrong  
  
You said that Edison would never make that light  
You laughed at Mr. Franklin with his key and kite  
The point of the song is I'm always wrong  
But with you baby I'm oh so right.

If I give my heart to you, will you handle it with care?  
Will you always treat me tenderly and in every way be fair?  
If I give my heart to you, will you give me all your love?  
Will you swear that you'll be true to me by the light that shines above?  
And will you sigh with me when I'm sad  
Smile with me when I'm glad  
And always be as you are with me tonight  
  
Think it over and be sure  
Please don't answer 'til you do  
When you promise all these things to me  
Then I'll give my heart to you  
  
If I give my heart to you, will you handle it with care?  
Will you always treat me tenderly and in every way be fair?  
If I give my heart to you, will you give me all your love?  
Will you swear that you'll be true to me by the light that shines above?  
And will you sigh with me when I'm sad  
Smile with me when I'm glad  
And always be as you are with me tonight  
  
Think it over and be sure  
Please don't answer 'til you do  
When you promise all these things to me  
Then I'll give my heart to you  

I'll never stop loving you  
Whatever else I may do  
My love for you will live 'til time itself is through  
I'll never stop wanting you  
And when forever is through  
My heart will beat the way it does each time we meet  
The night doesn't question the stars that appear in the skies  
So why should I question the stars that appear in my eyes  
Of this I'm more than just sure  
My love will last and endure  
I'll never, no, I'll never stop loving you  
  
I'll never stop loving you  
Whatever else I may do  
My love for you will live 'til time itself is through  
I'll never stop wanting you  
And when forever is through  
My heart will beat the way it does each time we meet  
The night doesn't question the stars that appear in the skies  
So why should I question the stars that appear in my eyes  
Of this I'm more than just sure  
My love will last and endure  
I'll never, no, I'll never stop loving you  

(Julie)  
It's the voice of my one love  
And it promises ecstasy  
Day and night it is calling me  
But I'm afraid to go  
  
(Julie)  
Though I run to escape it  
Still it calls irresistibly  
And although it's my destiny  
Sorrow is there, I know  
  
Warm are his arms, tender his kiss  
But in his eyes hidden, the danger lies  
  
(Julie)  
Must I go where he leads me?  
Though it be through eternity  
Oh, I know I will never be free  
Free from the voice that calls  
(Julie)

I just blew in from the windy city  
The windy city is mighty pretty  
But they ain't got what we got, no sirree  
They've got shacks up to seven storeys  
Never see any Morning Glorys  
But a step from our doorway  
We got 'em for free  
  
They've got those minstrel shows  
Pretty ladies in the big chapeauxs  
Private lawns, public parks  
For the sake of civic virtue  
They've got fountains there that squirt you  
  
I just blew in from the windy city  
The windy city is mighty pretty  
But they ain't got what we got  
I'm tellin' ya, boys  
We got more life in Deadwood City  
Than in all of Illinois  
  
You should-a seen me a-windo' shoppin'  
A-windo' shoppin' with eyes a-poppin'  
At the sights that you see there, yes sirree  
Press a bell and a moment later  
Up you go in an elevator  
Just as fast as a polecat a-climbin' a tree  
  
I heard claim hundreds came  
To a thing they call a baseball game  
Cigar stores, revolving doors  
They got new inventions coming  
'Stead of outdoor, indoor plumbing  
  
I just blew in from the windy city  
The windy city is mighty pretty  
But they ain't got what we got  
I'm tellin' ya, boys  
I ain't a-swappin' half of Deadwood  
For the whole of Illinois

Baby, your eyes have that look  
And, baby, I put down my book  
And maybe, we won't be disturbed  
By a thing  
  
Let it ring, let it ring, let it ring  
  
Oh, baby, I've got you alone  
And, baby, I'm not made of stone  
And maybe, we won't be disturned  
By a thing, this is too much  
  
Let it ring, let it ring, let it ring  
  
Doesn't matter who's on the line  
When your lips are so close to mine  
Don't let anybody intrude on this mood  
We're incommunicado  
  
Baby, if someone should call  
Ignore it, do nothing at all  
Just kiss me, who knows what  
This moment may bring  
  
Just let it ring, let it ring  
Oh, let it ring

Love me in the daytime  
Love me in the nighttime  
Anytime you love me  
Baby, that'll be the right time  
  
Put your arms around me  
When the lights are low  
Hug with the bearhug  
Never let me go  
  
Because I'm never, ever gonna  
Get enough of you, you, you  
No, I'm never, ever gonna  
Get enough of you  
  
We're as many as a million  
Red hot kisses overdue  
And I'm never, ever gonna  
Get enough of you  
  
I know I've had  
My fill of dancing  
When my tired twinkletoes  
Begin to ache  
  
I know I've satisfied  
My sweet tooth  
When I tell the waiter  
He can take the cake  
  
I know I'm loaded up  
With champagne  
When my brain begins  
To do a spineroo  
  
But as long as I keep living  
I'll take anything you're giving  
Cause I'm never, ever gonna  
Get enough of you  
  
Love me in the daytime  
Love me in the nighttime  
Anytime you love me  
That'll be the right time  
  
Put your arms around me  
When the lights are low  
Hug with the bearhug  
Never let me go  
  
Because I'm never, ever gonna  
Get enough of you, you, you  
No, I'm never, ever gonna  
Get enough of you  
  
We're as many as a million  
Red hot kisses overdue  
And I'm never, ever gonna  
Never, ever gonna  
Never, ever gonna  
Get enough of you  
  
You

Every time I hear that march from ?...Lowingrin...?  
I am always on the outside lookin' in  
Maybe that is why I see the funny side  
When I see somebody's brother take a bride  
Weddings make a lot of people sa-ad  
But if it isn't you they're not so bad  
Another bride, another June  
Another sunny honeymoon  
Another season, another reason  
For makin' whoopee  
A lot o' shoes, a lot o' rice  
The groom is nervous, he answers twice  
It's really killing, that he's so willing  
To make whoopee  
Picture a little love nest  
Down where the roses cling  
Picture the same sweet love nest  
Think what a year can bring  
He's washin' dishes and baby clothes  
He's so ambitious he even sews  
But don't forget folks  
That's what you get folks  
For makin' whoopee  
Down through the countless ages  
You'll find it everywhere  
Somebody makes good wages  
Somebody wants her share  
She calls him Toodles and rolls her eyes  
She makes him strudles and bakes him pies  
What is it all for  
Just so he'll fall for  
Makin' whoopee

We were sailing along on Moonlight Bay  
We could hear the voices ringing  
They seemed to say  
"You have stolen her heart"  
"Now don't go 'way"  
As we sang love's old sweet song on Moonlight Bay

My love and devotion  
Will always be true  
Now and forever  
I live for you  
  
My love and devotion  
Are yours, yours alone  
Kiss me beloved  
Say you're my own  
  
I kiss your lips  
Sweet and tender  
They open Heaven's door  
Won't you surrender  
Forevermore  
  
My love will grow deeper  
As time passes by  
Deep as the ocean  
And as high as the sky  
My love, my devotion  
Are yours till I die  
  
Deep as the ocean  
And as high as the sky  
My love, my devotion  
Are yours - till - I - die...

My young and foolish heart  
Makes me do the things I shouldn't  
That nine times out of ten  
I wouldn't do  
My young and foolish heart  
Never lets me use discretion  
In my manner of expression  
Every time I'm with you  
So, if my arms enfold you  
While I speak of love  
Remember what I told you  
Upon my soul, I can't control  
The recklessness of...  
My young and foolish heart  
Can be choosey and selective  
But you're the one objective  
Of my young and foolish heart

Stranded at the drive in  
Branded a fool  
What will they say  
Monday at school  
  
Sandy, can't you see I'm a misery  
We made a start now we're apart  
there's nothing left for me  
Love has flown, all alone  
I sit, I wonder, why-y-y Oh why  
You left me, oh Sandy  
Oh Sandy Baby  
Someday, when my high school is done  
Somehow, someway, our two worlds will be one  
And heaven forever and ever we will be  
Oh see, please say you'll stay Oh Sandy.  
Oh sandy, you hurt me real bad, call me back, 'coz baby you gotta believe me
when I say, I'm helpless without you  
Love has flown, all alone  
I sit, I wonder, why-y-y, oh why  
You left me, oh sandy  
Oh sandy baby  
Someday, when my high school is done  
Somehow, Someday our two worlds will be one  
Heaven forever and ever we will be  
Oh see, please say you'll stay oh sandy-y-y-y-y-y-y oh sandy

If you wonder  
Why I love him so  
He's different from  
The other boys I know  
  
Some have ginger  
And some have snap  
Some have this  
And some have that  
  
But my guy, all he's got  
Is ooh bang jiggilly jang  
  
Some have kisses  
That taste so sweet  
Taste like taters  
Or taste like meat  
  
But my guy, what a flavor  
Ooh bang jiggilly jang  
  
My bonnie lies over the mmm  
My bonnies lies over the  
Ooh bang jiggilly jang  
  
There's nobody lies  
Like my bonnie  
But even though my  
Bonnie lies to me  
  
I forgive him cause  
Some are charming  
And some have looks  
Some have money  
And some read books  
  
But my guy, he's got  
So much ooh bang jiggilly jang  
  
My bonnie lies over the mmm  
My bonnies lies over the  
Ooh bang jiggilly jang  
  
There's nobody lies

When all the world  
Is a hopeless jumble  
And the raindrops tumble all around  
Heaven opens a magic lane  
  
When all the clouds darken up the skyway  
There's a rainbow highway to be found  
Leading from your window pane  
To a place behind the sun just a step beyond the rain  
  
Somewhere over the rainbow  
Way up high  
There's a land that I heard of once  
In a lullaby  
  
Somewhere over the rainbow  
Skies are blue  
And the dreams that you care to dream  
Really do come true  
  
Someday I'll wish upon a star  
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me  
Where troubles melt like lemon drops way above the chimney tops  
That's where you'll find me  
  
Somewhere over the rainbow  
Bluebirds fly  
Birds fly over the rainbow  
Why then oh why can't I?  
  
If happy little bluebirds fly over the rainbow  
Why oh why can't I?

I've got a man, his name is Pe-ete  
He's awfully good and oh so sweet  
He's not the kind that you usually meet  
He loves me so-o and I love Pete  
A gal that I know loves a boy named Ji-im  
Though he treats her mean she still loves him  
And Sally loves Joe who's the kind that'll cheat  
Some men are like that but not my Pete  
He never beats me  
Never mistreats me  
He never teases  
He only pleases  
I take my troubles with a grain of salt  
'Cause I've got a man without a fault  
I put him on trial, he passed every te-est  
Whatever he does, he does his best  
I've got no complaints and my life is complete  
'Cause I've got a man whose name is Pete  
He never beats me  
Never mistreats me  
He never teases  
He only pleases  
I take my troubles with a grain of salt  
'Cause I've got a man without a fault  
I put him on trial, he passed every te-est  
Whatever he does, he does his best  
I've got no complaints and my life is complete  
'Cause I've got a ma-an, what a ma-an  
His name is Pete...

Pillow Talk  
Doris Day  
Written by Buddy Pepper and Inez James  
This song did not chart  
Title song from the 1959 film starring Day and Rock Hudson  
  
Pillow talk, pillow talk  
Another night of hearin' myself talk, talk, talk, talk  
Wonder how it would be to have someone to pillow talk with me  
I wonder how  
I wonder who  
Pillow talk, pillow talk  
Another night of bein' alone with pillow talk  
When it's all said and done, two heads together can be better than one  
That's what they say  
They always say  
All I do is talk to my pillow  
Talk to my pillow, talk to my pillow  
All I do is talk to my pillow  
Talk about the boy I'm gonna marry someday  
Somehow, some way, sometime  
Pillow talk, pillow talk  
Another night of gettin' my fill of pillow talk  
You and I both agree there must be a boy, must be a pillow  
Must be a pillow-talkin' boy for me  
I hope I'm right  
I'd better be right  
Oh, there must be a pillow-talkin' boy for me  
(We hope she's right, she'd better be right, there must be a boy)  
There must be a boy  
There must be a boy  
There must be a boy  
There MUST be a boy!!  
There MUST!!  
  
  

You can take the moon  
Gather up the stars  
And the robins that sing merrily  
Put 'em in a box  
Tie it with a ribbon  
Throw 'em in the deep blue sea  
  
You can take the flowers  
Down in lovers lane  
And that sentimental poetry  
Put 'em in a box  
Tie it with a ribbon  
Throw 'em in the deep blue sea  
  
Not for me, all that stuff  
The dreams that ruin your sleep  
Not for me, had enough  
Love is one thing you can keep  
  
You can take the plans  
And the wedding bells  
And whoever sings "Oh Promise Me"  
Put 'em in a box  
Tie it with a ribbon  
Throw 'em in the deep blue sea  
'Cause love and I we don't agree  
  
[Bridge:]  
  
Hansoms through the park  
Kisses in the dark  
All the promises made faithfully  
Put 'em in a box  
Tie it with a ribbon  
Throw 'em in the deep blue sea  
  
And you won't go wrong  
If you take a song  
Sung by Frankie Boy or Mr. C  
Put 'em in a box  
Tie it with a ribbon  
Throw 'em in the deep blue sea  
  
Not for me, all that stuff  
Not for me, had enough  
  
You know what to do  
With good old "Tea for Two"  
And the girl for you, the boy for me  
Put 'em in a box  
Tie it with a ribbon  
Throw 'em in the deep blue sea  
'Cause love and I we don't agree

When I was just a little girl  
I asked my mother, what will I be  
Will I be pretty, will I be rich  
Here's what she said to me.  
  
Que Sera, Sera,  
Whatever will be, will be  
The future's not ours, to see  
Que Sera, Sera  
What will be, will be.  
  
When I was young, I fell in love  
I asked my sweetheart what lies ahead  
Will we have rainbows, day after day  
Here's what my sweetheart said.  
  
Que Sera, Sera,  
Whatever will be, will be  
The future's not ours, to see  
Que Sera, Sera  
What will be, will be.  
  
Now I have children of my own  
They ask their mother, what will I be  
Will I be handsome, will I be rich  
I tell them tenderly.  
  
Que Sera, Sera,  
Whatever will be, will be  
The future's not ours, to see  
Que Sera, Sera  
What will be, will be.

Gonna take a sentimental journey  
Gonna set my heart at ease  
Gonna make a sentimental journey  
To renew old memories  
  
Got my bag, got my reservation  
Spent each dime I could afford  
Like a child in wild anticipation  
Long to hear that "All aboard"  
  
Seven, that's the time we leave, at seven  
I'll be waitin' up for heaven  
Countin' every mile of railroad track  
That takes me back  
  
Never thought my heart could be so 'yearny'  
Why did I decide to roam?  
Gotta take that sentimental journey  
Sentimental journey home,  
  
Sentimental journey!

City sidewalks, busy sidewalks  
Dressed in holiday style  
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas  
  
Children laughing, people passing  
Meeting smile after smile  
And on every street corner you hear  
  
Silver bells, silver bells  
It's Christmas time in the city  
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring  
Soon it will be Christmas day  
  
Strings of street lights, even stop lights  
Blink a bright red and green  
As the shoppers rush home with their treasures  
  
Hear the snow crunch, see the kids bunch  
This is Santa's big scene  
And above all the bustle you hear  
  
Silver bells, silver bells  
It's Christmas time in the city  
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring  
Soon it will be Christmas day  
  
Silver bells, silver bells  
It's Christmas time in the city  
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring  
Soon it will be Christmas day  
(Ding, dong, ding, dong, ding)

I'm singing in the rain  
just singing in the rain  
What a glorious feeling  
I'm happy again  
I'm laughin the clouds  
So dark up above  
the suns in my heart  
and I'm ready for love  
let the stormy clouds chase  
everyone from the place  
comon with the rain  
I have a smile on my face  
I walk down the lane  
with a happy refraim  
and I'm singing,  
Just singing in the rain  
I'm singing in the rain  
Just singing in the rain  
what a glorious feeling  
I'm so happy again  
I'm laughing the clouds  
So dark up above  
the sun's in my heart  
and I'm ready for love  
let the stormy clouds chase  
Everyone from the place  
comon with the rain  
I have a smile on my face  
I walk down the lane  
with a happy refraim  
and I'm singing,  
Just singing in the rain

SOMEONE LIKE YOU  
Doris Day  
Someone like you cures everything gloomy  
Turns wrong into right, brightens the night,  
Brings happiness to me.  
Makes me luckier than throwin' a seven  
Takes me nearer to heaven than anyone's allowed to do  
When your heart is talkin' I feel like I'm walkin  
On a cloud with someone like you  
Some day I'll find someone I can boast to,  
Somebody to hug a bug in a rug to snuggle up close to  
And whenever I do, do you know th ewho,  
Who I'll give the most to.  
You prey on my mind, stay till I find,  
Someone like you  
  

From the snow-capped mountains to the coral shores  
You're the only one my heart adores  
You've only got three competitors  
Tacos, enchiladas and beans  
  
From the Mississippi to the Amazon  
There's not much we don't agree upon  
Wish we could get together on  
Tacos, enchiladas and beans  
  
Love 'em, dozens of 'em  
I consume them by the score  
And when I'm through, what do I do  
I stamp and holler for more  
  
You can have the fourth position on my list  
Must admit your kisses would be missed  
But how in the world could I exist  
Without tacos, enchiladas and beans  
  
(Repeat from the top)  
They make me kind of sick  
But I love them

(Pum, pa dumb pa dum)  
(Pum pa dumb pa dum)  
(Pa dumb pa dum)  
(Pum pa dumb pa dum)  
Teacher's pet (pa dumb pa dumb pa dum)  
I want to be teacher's pet (pa dumb pa dum)  
I want to be huddled and cuddled as close to you as I can get  
(That's the lesson we're guessin' you're best in)  
Mm, teacher's pride (pa dumb pa dum)  
I want to be teacher's pride (pa dumb pa dum)  
I want to be dated, paraded, the one most likely at your side  
(Ya got a burnin' yearnin' to learn)  
I want to learn all your lips can teach me  
One kiss will do at the start (are you really?)  
I'm sure with a little homework  
I'll graduate to your heart (to your heart)  
Teacher's pet (pa dumb pa dum), I want to be teacher's pet (pa dumb pa dum)  
I want to take home a diploma and show Ma that ya love me, too  
(That ya love me, too)  
So I can be teacher's pet long after school is through  
(Oh, teacher's pet) Mm, mm  
(You want to be teacher's pet) Ah. ah  
(You want to be huddled and cuddled as close to him as you can get)  
I want to learn all your lips can teach me  
One kiss will do at the start  
I'm sure with a little homework  
I'll graduate to your heart  
Teacher's pet (you love the teacher), I want to be teacher's pet (pa dumb pa
dum)  
I want to take home a diploma and show Ma that ya love me, too (Wow!)  
So I can be teacher's pet (yeah!) long after school is through  
(Teacher, teacher she loves you)

I saw you last night and got that old feeling  
When you came in sight I got that old feeling  
The moment that you danced by, I felt a thrill  
And when you caught my eye, my heart stood still  
  
Once again I seemed to feel that old yearning  
And I knew the spark of love was still burning  
There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start  
For that old, old feeling is still in my heart  
  
There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start  
For that old, old feeling is still in my heart

When the mellow moon begins to beam  
Every night I dream a little dream  
And of course Prince Charming is the theme  
The he, for me.  
Although I realize as well as you  
It is seldom that a dream comes true,  
To me it's clear  
That he'll appear.  
  
Some day he'll come along, the man I love  
And he'll be big and strong, the man I love  
And when he comes my way,  
I'll do my best to make him stay.  
  
He'll look at me and smile, I'll understand  
And in a little while, he'll take my hand  
And though it seems absurd  
I know we both won't say a word.  
  
Maybe I shall meet him Sunday,  
Maybe Monday, maybe not  
Still I'm sure to meet him one day  
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day.  
  
He'll build a little home just meant for two  
From which I'll never roam, who would? would you?  
And so, all else above,  
I'm waiting for the man I love.

Li-ittle girl and boy land  
While you dwell within it  
You are ever happy there  
  
Childhood's joy land  
Mi-istic merry toy land  
Once you pass its borders  
You can ne'er return again  
  
When you've grown up my dears  
And are as old as I  
You'll laugh and ponder on the years  
That roll so swiftly by my dears  
That roll so swi-iftly by-why  
  
Childhood's joy land  
Mi-istic merry toy land  
Once you pass its borders  
You can ne'er return again

Getting crazy on the waltzers but it's the life that I choose  
Sing about the sixblade sing about the switchback and a torture tattoo  
And I been riding on a ghost train where the cars they scream and slam  
And I don't know where I'll be tonight but I'd always tell you where I am  
  
In a screaming ring of faces I seen her standing in the light  
She had a ticket for the races just like me she was a victim of the night  
I put a hand upon the lever said let it rock and let it roll  
I had the one arm bandit fever there was an arrow through my heart and my soul  
  
And the big wheel keep on turning neon burning up above  
And I'm just high on the world  
Come on and take a low ride with me girl  
On the tunnel of love  
  
It's just the danger when you're riding at your own risk  
She said you are the perfect stranger she said baby let's keep it like this  
It's just a cake walk twisting baby step right up and say  
Hey mister give me two give me two cos any two can play  
  
And the big wheel keep on turning neon burning up above  
And I'm just high on the world  
Come on and take a low ride with me girl  
On the tunnel of love  
  
Well it's been money for muscle another whirligig  
Money for muscle and another girl I dig  
Another hustle just to make it big  
And rockaway rockaway  
  
And girl it looks so pretty to me just like it always did  
Like the spanish city to me when we were kids  
Oh girl it looks so pretty to me just like it always did  
Like the spanish city to me when we were kids  
  
She took off a silver locket she said remember me by this  
She put her hand in my pocket I got a keepsake and a kiss  
And in the roar of the dust and diesel I stood and watched her walk away  
I could have caught up with her easy enough but something must have made me  
Stay  
  
And the big wheel keep on turning neon burning up above  
And I'm just high on the world  
Come on and take a low ride with me girl  
On the tunnel of love  
  
And now I'm searching through these carousels and the carnival arcades  
Searching everywhere from steeplechase to palisades  
In any shooting gallery where promises are made  
To rockaway rockaway from cullercoats and whitley bay out to rockaway  
  
And girl it looks so pretty to me like it always did  
Like the spanish city to me when we were kids  
Girl it looks so pretty to me like it always did  
Like the spanish city to me when we were kids

Twelve o'clock tonight  
(Twelve o'clock tonight)  
Meet me at the door  
(Meet me at the door)  
  
I'll kiss you goodnight  
(I'll kiss you goodnight)  
Once more (once more)  
  
Then I'll go to bed  
(Gotta go to bed)  
Busy day ahead  
(Busy day ahead)  
  
But I know instead  
(But I know instead)  
I'll walk the floor  
(Walk the floor)  
  
Since I've been with you  
Can't concentrate  
Want to stay up light  
Baby, I'll wait for you  
  
Then I'll hold you tight  
(Then I'll hold you tight)  
Til the sun is bright  
(Til the sun is bright)  
  
Meet me at the door (for sure)  
At twelve o'clock tonight  
(Twelve o'clock tonight)  
  
Twelve o'clock tonight  
Mmm, middle of the night  
Not a soul in sight  
To interfere with our love  
  
Teacher may scold  
Mama may call  
But if we're quiet  
Down in the hall  
  
I'll be hugging you tight  
(I'll be hugging you tight)  
Twelve o'clock tonight  
  
Twelve o'clock tonight  
Twelve o'clock tonight  
Twelve o'clock tonight

When I fall in love  
It will be forever  
Or I'll never fall in love  
  
In a restless world like this is  
Love is ended before its begun  
And too many moonlight kisses  
Seem to cool in the warmth of the sun  
  
When I give my heart  
It will be completely  
Or I'll never give my heart  
  
And the moment I can feel that  
You feel that way too  
Is when I fall in love with you  
  
And the moment I can feel that  
You feel that way too  
Is when I fall in love with you...

Why don't we do this more often  
Just what we're doin' tonight  
Gee, but it's great to get together again  
Why does it only happen now and then  
We oughtta do this more often  
Don't you agree that I'm right  
We make each other laugh  
We make each other sing  
And you can never ever  
Over-do a good thing  
So why don't we do this more often  
Just what we're doin' tonight  
Why don't we do this more often  
Just what we're doin' tonight  
Oh gee, but it's great to get together again  
Why does it only happen now and then  
We oughtta do it more often  
Don't you agree that I'm right  
We make each other laugh  
We make each other sing  
And you can never ever  
Overdo a good thing  
Why don't we do it more often  
Just what we're doin' tonight

Over the ground lies a mantle of white  
A heaven of diamonds shine down through the night  
Two hearts are thrillin' in spite of the chill in  
The weather  
  
Love knows no seasons, love knows no climb  
Romance can blossom, any old time  
Here in the open, we're walkin' and hopin'  
Together  
  
Sleigh bells ring, are you listenin'?  
In the lane, snow is glistenin'  
A beautiful site, we're happy tonight  
Walkin' in the winter wonderland  
  
Gone away is the blue bird  
Here to stay is a new bird  
He sings his love song, as we go along  
Walkin' in the winter wonderland  
  
In the meadow we can build a snowman  
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown  
He'll say, "Are you married?" We'll say, "No, man"  
But you can do the job when you're in town  
  
Later on, we'll conspire as we dream by the fire  
To face unafraid, the plans that we made  
Walkin' in the winter wonderland  
Walkin' in the winter wonderland

The other night, dear  
As I lay sleeping  
I dreamed I held you  
In my arms  
When I awoke, dear  
I was mistaken  
And I hung my head and cried  
  
[Chorus]  
You are my sunshine  
My only sunshine  
You make me happy  
When skies are grey  
You'll never know, dear  
How much I love you  
Please, don't take my sunshine away  
  
I'll always love you  
And make you happy  
If you will only  
Stay the same  
But if you leave me  
To love another  
You'll regret it all someday  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You told me once, dear  
You really loved me  
And no one else could come between  
But now you've left me and love another  
You have shattered all of my dreams  
  
[Chorus]

You do something to me  
Something that simply mystifies me  
Tell me, why should it be  
You have the power to hypnotize me  
  
Let me live 'neath your spell  
You do that voodoo that you do so well  
  
For you do something to me  
That nobody else could do.  
  
Let me live 'neath your spell  
You do that voodoo that you do so well  
  
For you do something to me  
That nobody else could do  
  
That nobody else could do
