Barbara allan to bill and anne mulloy of calgary, alberta  
It was in and about the martinmas time  
When the green leaves were a fallin'  
That sir john graeme o' the west countree  
Fell in love wi' barbara allan  
He sent his men down thro' the town  
To the place where she was dwellin'  
O haste and come to my master dear  
Gin ye be barbara allan  
O hooly hooly rose she up  
To the place where he was lyin'  
And when she drew the curtain by  
Young man I think yer dyin'  
Oh it's I am sick and very very sick  
And it's a for barbara allan  
O the better for me ye se never be  
Tho' your hearts blood be spillin'  
Remember ye not in the tavern sir  
When ye the cups were fillin'  
How ye made the healths gae round and round  
And slighted barbara allan  
He turned his face unto the wa'  
And death was with him dealin'  
Adieu adieu my dear friands a'  
Be kind tae barbara alan  
Then hooly hooly raise she up  
And slowly slowly left him  
And sighing said she could not stay  
Since death o'life had reft him  
She hadnae gone a mile but twa  
When she heard the deid bell knellin'  
And every jow tha the deid bell gied  
Cried woe tae barbara allan  
O mother mother make my bed  
O make it fast and narrow  
Since my love died for me today  
I die for him tomorrow  

Bluebells of scotland : to nat the cat, minnie and alec  
O where tell me where has your heelin' laddie gone?  
O where tell me where has your heelin' laddie gone?  
He's gone wi' streamin' banners where noble deeds are done  
And it's oh in my heart that I wish him safely hame  
O what lassie what does your heelin' laddie wear?  
O what lassie what does your heelin' laddie wear?  
A scarlett coat and bonnet wi' bonnie yellow hair  
And there's none in the world can wi' my sweet love compare  
Oh what tell me what if your heelin' lad be slain  
Oh what tell me what if your heelin' lad be slain  
O no true love will be his guard  
And bring him safe again  
O my heart would break if my heelin' lad be slain  
O what will you claim for your constancy tae him?  
O what will you claim for your constancy tae him?  
I'll claim a priest tae wed us and a clerk tae say amen  
And I'll ne'er part again from my bonnie heelin' man  

The christmas season here at last  
I wish you peace and joy  
I'll sing this song of times long gone  
And pray you will enjoy  
For the fondest memories I recall  
Were on a christmas morn'  
When my dear father sang his songs  
And christ the king was born  
The songs he sang so loudly rang  
Throughout our happy house  
But when mother took her turn,  
He sat as quietly as a mouse  
The fondest memories I recall  
Were on a christmas morn'  
How mother sang the sweetest songs  
And christ the king was born.  
I am my father's son you know  
And I sing on christmas day  
I sing a song to days long gone  
And those who've passed away  
I have four children proud and strong  
And they have children too  
And on christmas morn they sing along  
Just like we use to do  
The fondest memories we shall have  
Take place on christmas morn'  
My children's children sing their songs  
And christ the king is born.  

Ah Danny boy, the pipes,  
The pipes are calling  
From glen to glen,  
And down the mountain side  
  
The summer's gone,  
And all the flowers are falling  
'Tis you, 'tis you  
Must go and I must bide  
  
But come ye back  
When summer's in the meadow  
Or when the valley's hushed  
And white with snow  
  
And I'll be here  
In sunshine or in shadow  
Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy,  
I love you so  
  
But if you come,  
And all the flowers are falling  
And I am dead,  
As dead I may well be  
  
You'll come and find  
The place where I am lying  
And kneel and say  
An "Ave" there for me  
  
And I will hear,  
Though soft your tread above me  
And o'er my grave  
Will warmer sweeter be  
  
And you will bend  
And tell me that you love me  
And I will sleep  
In peace until you come to me  
  
But if I live  
And should you die for Ireland  
Let not your dying thoughts  
Be just of me  
  
But say a prayer to God  
For our dearest Island  
I know He'll hear  
And help to set her free  
  
And I will take your pike  
And place my dearest  
And strike a blow,  
Though weak the blow may be  
  
Twill help the cause  
To which your heart was nearest  
Oh Danny Boy, Oh, Danny boy  
I love you so.

These are the thoughts of a father  
On the wedding day of his daughter  
As his mind wanders back to the first time he held her  
He looks at her now, the same pride in his eyes  
As onto the dance floor they glide  
This is the dance of the bride and her father  
Dance with me daughter of mine  
On this your wedding day  
Dance with me daughter of mine  
You'll soon be going away  
I loved you since you first began  
Now you've found a new man  
But I love you so, and this you must know  
That my love won't falter  
So dance with me daughter  
Beautiful daughter of mine  
  
We walk down the aisle  
On my face there's a smile  
But deep in my heart there's a tear  
Our friends and relations are here in the church  
With smiles on their faces they stare  
As we walk t'ward the man who has stolen your heart  
And to whom I must give you away  
But I wish you love and happiness too  
On this your wedding day  
  
Chorus  
The dance has begun  
We twirl around the floor  
But I know you're not my little girl anymore  
A lovely young woman has taken her place  
And there's happiness written all over her face  
But always remember although we must part  
You may leave my arms but never my heart  
  
Chorus  
  

Now that we have come this far  
Don't be frightened by the night  
Just let me be your guardian angel  
You will be my guiding light  
  
We've been on this road so long  
And sometimes not know where we are  
That's when I'd be your lost horizon  
You would be my Shangri La  
  
Praise slips out so easily  
It may not sound sincere  
But it only seems to come to me  
Whenever you are near  
  
So thank you for the joy ou bring  
Thank you for your love each night  
I'll always be your guardian angel  
Always be my guiding light  
  
When the sun is far too strong  
When the wind is cold as ice  
That's when I'll be your life's oasis  
You will be my paradise  
  
So thank you for the joy you bring  
Thank you for your love each night  
I'll always be your guardian angel  
Always be my guiding light  
  
Yes I'll always be your guardian angel  
As long as you'll be my guiding light

Here, making each day of the year  
Changing my life with a wave of her hand  
Nobody can deny that there's something there  
There running my hands through her hair  
Both of us thinking how good it can be  
Someone is speaking but she doesn't know he's there  
  
I want here everywhere  
And if she's beside me I know I need never care  
But to love her is to need her  
  
Everywhere, knowing that love is to share  
Each one believing that love never dies  
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there  
  
I will be there and everywhere  
Here there and everywhere  
I will be there and everywhere  
Here there and everywhere

Kathleen : to pan and terry  
Blown like a leaf on a warm summer breeze  
A vision approached me as cool as you please  
With her strawberry hair and a wink in her eye  
To say I was smitten would not be a lie  
Gathering courage I started to speak  
To ask of her name but my heart felt too weak  
Like I'd gone to heaven before I had died  
I mumbled the question she calmly replied 'kathleen'  
Well I remember my first motorbike  
With her riding pillion I'd not heard the like  
Of her giggles and squeels as we leaned left and right  
And feeling her arms round my chest holding tight  
Whilrwind romances were never my speed  
But this one took off like a runaway steed  
When she said she was having the time of her life  
I knew then this vision would soon be my wife, kathleen  
Oh kathleen the memories you've left me  
They'll be with me through all of my days  
Thinking there's safety in numbers no doubt  
Acounts for the fact that the wholw town turned out  
To behold how serenely she walked down the aisle  
But trembled and blushed as I kissed her sweet smile  
Picnics on beaches and punts on the lake  
Luck seemed to serve us a slice of life's cake  
That was more than enought to sustain us through years  
When laughter would somehow give way to some tears kathleen  
Oh kathleen the memories you've left me  
They'll be with me through all of my days  
Then at the ball she looked ever so sweet  
Heavy with child but still light on her feet  
Every head turned our way as we whirled o'er the floor  
And I love her more than I'd loved her before  
(instrumental)  
Two caring children siobhan and marie  
A grand little grandchild to bounce on my knee  
They're a fine testimonial to all that was right  
In keeping our candle of love burning bright, kathleen  
Now as my life nears it's own eventide  
It's almost as though she were here by my side  
Such a presence an aura so perfectly made  
My beautiful vision that never will fade kathleen  

Lo how a rose e'er blooming  
From tender stem hath sprung  
Of jesse's lineage coming  
As seers of old have sung  
It came a blossom bright  
Amid the cold of winter  
When half spent was the night  
  
Isaiah 'twas foretold it  
The rose I have in mind  
With mary we behold it  
The virgin mother kind  
To show god's love a right  
She bore to us a savior  
When half spent was the night  
  
O flower whose fragrance tender  
With sweetness fills the air  
Dispel in glorious splendor  
The darkness everywhere  
True man yet very god  
From sin and death now save us  
And share our every load

I have heard the mavis singing  
His love song to the moon  
I have seen the dewdrop clinging  
To the rose just nearly born  
But a sweeter song has cheer'd me  
At the evening's gentle close  
And I've seen an eye still brighter  
Than the dewdrop on the rose  
'twas thy voice, my gentle mary,  
And thine artless winning smile  
That made this world an eden,  
Bonie mary of argyle  
Tho' thy voice may lose it's sweetness,  
Thine eye it's brightness too  
Tho' thy step may lack it's fleetness  
And thy hair it's sunny hue  
Still to me wilt thou be dearer  
Than all the world shall own  
I have loved thee for thy beauty,  
But not for that alone  
I have watched thy heart, dear mary  
And it's goodness was the wile  
That has made thee mine forever,  
Bonnie mary of argyle  

O, my love is like a red, red rose  
That's newly sprung in June  
O, my love is like a melody  
That's sweetly played in tune  
So fair art thou, my bonnie lass  
So deep in love am I  
And I will love thee still  
My dear till a' the seas gang dry  
Till a' the seas gang dry my dear  
And the rocks melt wi' the sun  
And I will love thee still, my dear  
While the sands of life shall run  
And fare thee weel, my only love  
And fare thee weel awhile  
And I will come again, my dear  
Tho' 'twere ten thousand mile  
Tho' 'twere ten thousand miles my dear  
Tho' 'twere ten thousand miles  
And I will come again, my dear  
Tho' 'twere ten thousand miles  

You'll never be the sun turning in the sky  
And you won't be the moon above us on a moonlit night  
And you won't be the stars in heaven although they burn so bright  
But even on the deepest ocean you will be the light  
You may not always shine as you go barefoot over stone  
You might be so long together or you might walk alone  
And you won't find that love comes easy but that love is always right  
So even when the dark clouds gather you will be the light  
And if you lose the part inside when loves turns round on you  
Leaving the past behind is knowing you'll do like you always do  
Holding you blind, keeping you true  
You'll never be the sun turning in the sky  
And you won't be the moon above us on a moonlit night  
And you won't be the stars in heaven although they burn so bright  
But even on the deepest ocean you will be the light  

You could shoot off a cannon  
Down the middle of bond  
And attract no attention in downtown st. John's  
This getting nowhere is getting to me  
Wondering where can you go  
To be all you can be  
  
No regular joe wants to pull up and go  
And wind up homesick  
Where there's no one you know  
Just a smoke and a beer  
And the sports on tv  
Being sorry you left  
With no choice but to leave  
  
[Chorus:]  
No change in the weather  
No change in me  
I don't want to leave  
But I can't live for free  
Can't eat the air, can't drink the sea  
No change in the weather  
No change in me  
  
You could shoot off a cannon  
From the top of long's hill  
And a gulliver's taxi might be all that you'd kill  
We were promised the sun  
And the moon and the stars  
We got weathered old clapboard and salt-rusted cars  
  
So I'll join in the leaving like all of the rest  
Montreal, calgary, vancouver west  
Lay down on the sidewalk  
Kick off and die  
And watch people not looking  
As they hurry by  
  
[Chorus:]

O holy night  
The stars are brightly shining  
It is the night  
Of the dear saviour's birth  
Long lay the world  
In sin and error pining  
'til he appeared  
And the soul felt its worth  
A thrill of hope  
The weary world rejoices  
For yonder breaks  
A new and glorious morn'  
Fall on your knees  
O hear the angel voices  
O night divine  
O night when Christ was born  
O night divine, o night, o night divine  
  
Led by the light of faith serenely beaming  
With glowing hearts  
By his cradle we stand  
So led by the light  
Of a star sweetly gleaming  
There came the wise men  
From orient land  
The king of kings lay  
Thus in lowly manger  
In all our trials  
Born to be our friend  
He knows our need  
He guardeth us from danger  
Behold your king  
Before him lowly bend  
Behold you king  
Before him lowly bend

Oh rowan tree, oh rowan tree  
Thou'lt aya be dear to thee  
Entwined thou art wi' many ties  
O'hame and infancy  
Thy leaves were aye the first of spring  
Thy flowers the summer's pride  
There was nae sic a bonnie tree  
In a' the country side  
Oh rowan tree  
  
How fair was thou in summer time  
Wi' a'thy clusters white  
How rich and gay thy autumn dress,  
Wi' berries red and bright!  
On thy fair stem were mony names  
Which now nae mair I see  
But they're engraven on my heart,  
Forget they ne'er can be  
Oh rowan tree  
  
We sat aneath thy spreadin' shade  
The bairnies round thee ran  
They pu'd they bonnie berries red,  
And necklaces they strang  
My mither, oh! I see her still,  
She smil'd our sports to see  
Wi' little jeannie on her lap,  
And jamie on her knee  
Oh rowan tree  
  
Oh there arose my father's pray'are  
In holy ev'ning's calm  
How sweet was them my mother's voice,  
In the martyrs' psalm  
Now a'are gane!  
We meet nae mair aneath the rowan tree  
But hallow'd thoughts around thee twine  
O'hame and infancy  
Oh rowan tree

How old was I, 5 or 6 or so  
The innocent years, long ago  
Father on a chair reaching up so far  
Crowning the tree, with that old tin star  
And it shines so pretty diamonds in the sun  
Nothin' but good things will ever come  
Little boy don't grow up stay as sweet as you are  
So you still gaze in wonder at that old tin star.  
I grew up and I found a place to live  
As I unpacked my things I found a gift  
And it felt like home, though I'd come so far  
For there in my hands was that old tin star  
And it shines so pretty, diamonds in the sun  
Nothing but good things, will ever come  
Little boy don't grow up, stay as sweet as you are  
So you still gaze in wonder, at that old tin star.  
I have kids of my own and troubles I've had some  
I've cried my tears and I've had my fun  
I climb that chair and I reach out so far  
And my son looks up at that old tin star  
And it shines so pretty, diamonds in the sun  
Nothing but good things will ever come  
Little boy don't grow up, stay as sweet as you are  
So you still gaze in wonder, at that old tin star.  

Two island swans  
They mated for life  
And his faithful heart  
Would not consider any other wife  
  
With three years of peaceful joy  
With the rushes of the pond  
Proud and gentle was the love  
Of the last two island swans.  
  
There love was like a circle  
With no beginning and no end  
With his lady by his side  
A treasure and best friend  
  
And the pond was oh so peaceful  
And the rising of the sun  
Young and free as the island breeze  
Their lives had just begun  
  
Till a dark day in November  
With the seering cold that starts  
Stalked the hunter with his bow  
And put an arrow through her heart  
  
[Chorus]  
And the cold wind blow  
He was brave but he lay low  
By her body in the isle of mist  
I saw her give him one last cold kiss  
One last cold kiss  
  
Now swans like people  
Talk of only one in this fair side  
Though they brought him 20 ladies  
He would take no other bride  
  
And they say he will not move  
From the place where she did fall  
Once so proud he's beaten now  
And he will not rise at all  
  
[Chorus]

When I need to feel you near me  
I stand in this quiet place  
Where the silver light of countless stars  
Falling on my face  
Though they all shine so brightly  
Somehow it comforts me to know  
That some that burn the brightest  
Died an eternity ago  
Chorus  
But your light still shines  
It's one small star to guide me  
And it helps me to hold back the dark  
Your light's still shining in my heart  
I'm learning how to live without you  
And I never thought I could  
And even how to smile again  
I never thought I would  
And I cherish your heart's memories  
Cause they bring you back to life  
Some caress me gently  
And some cut me like a knife  
Chorus  
Can your soul be out there some where  
Beyond the infinity of time  
I guess you've found some answers now  
I'll have to wait for mine  
When my light joins with yours one day  
We'll shine through time and space  
And one day fall on a distant age  
Upon some stranger's face  
But your light still shines  
It's one small star to guide me  
And it helps me to hold back the dark  
Your light's still shining in my heart  
Your light's still shining in my heart  

Dear friend of mine, the weather's fine  
Today I saw some ruins of the Roman worlds decline  
And I climbed those Spanish steps, you heard so much about  
But Rome has lost its glory, I don't know what it's about  
I wish you were here  
When the shadows falling and all the rushing traffic's still  
I wish you were here  
When the bells are ringing on the Seven Hills  
I'll make my way to a small cafe  
I wonder what you did today  
I wish you were here  
Dear one at home, I just flew in from Rome  
Paris is a postcard all decked out in colour chrome  
So I climbed the Eiffel Tower, I prayed at Notre Dame  
But I just can't find the romance and I wonder why I came  
I wish you were here  
On the Champs-Elysees, lovers walking hand in hand  
I wish you were here  
When they take one look at me and seem to understand  
This city of light is a lovely sight  
But the first bright star I see tonight  
I wish you were here  
Now I write this from the plane  
Drinking cheap champagne  
Wondering how two people got so far apart  
Wish you were here  
Here in London where the rain is pouring down  
I wish you were here  
On this airplane headed back to New York town  
I'll never leave you alone again  
I'm coming home but until then  
I wish you were here  
I wish you were here  
I wish you were here  

Scotland for ever (scotland the brave) : to cliff hanley  
  
Let italy boast of her gay gilded waters  
Her vines and her bowers and her soft sunny skies  
Her sons drinking love from the eyes of her daughters  
Where freedom expires amid softness and sighs  
Scotland's blue mountains wild where hoary cliffs are piled  
Towering in grandeur are dearer tae me  
Land of the misty cloud land of the tempest loud  
Land of the brave and proud land of the free  
Enthroned on the peak of her own highland mountains  
Te spirit of scotia reigns fearless and free  
Her green tartan waving o'er blue rock and fountain  
And proudly she sings looking over the sea  
Here among my mountains wild I have serenely smiled  
When armies and empires against me were hurled  
Firm as my native rock I have withstood the shock  
Of england, of denmark, or rome and the world  
But see how proudly her war steeds are prancing  
Deep groves of steel trodden down in their path  
The eyes of my sons like their bright swords are glancing  
Triumphantly riding through ruin and death  
Bold hearts and nodding plumes wave o'er their bloody tombs  
Deepeyed in gore is the green tartan's wave  
Shivering are the ranks of steel dire is the horseman's wheel  
Victorious in battlefield scotland the brave  
Bold hearts and nodding plumes wave o'er their bloody tombs  
Deepeyed in gore is the green tartan's wave  
Shivering are the ranks of steel dire is the horseman's wheel  
Victorious in battlefield scotland the brave  
Victorious in battlefield scotland the brave

My young love said to me  
"My mother won't mind  
And my father won't slight you  
For your lack of kind"  
And she stepp'd away from me  
And this she did say  
"It will not be long, love  
Till our wedding day"  
  
She stepp'd away fromme  
And went through the fair  
And fondly I watch'd her  
Move here and move there  
And then she went homeward  
With one star awake  
As the swan in the evening  
Moves over the lake  
  
The people were saying  
That no two e'er were wed  
And one had a sorrow  
That never was said  
And I smiled as she passed  
With her goods and her gear  
And that was the last  
That I saw my dear  
  
Last night she came to me  
She came softly in  
So softly she came  
That her feet made no din  
And she placed her hand on me  
And this she did say  
"Oh it will not be long, love  
Till our wedding day"

The snow is softly falling  
The night is cold and grey  
The forests fields and mountains  
Await the coming day  
One star outshines the others  
So bright as if to say  
This is a special morning  
A child was born on christmas day.  
Long ago, far away  
In a stable bare  
Look and see, he sleeps so peacefully  
As if the cold of night were never there  
Bless all the little children  
Whenever they may lay  
Somewhere a child is sleeping  
A child was born on christmas day.  
So we might love each other  
In peace and honor's way  
Somewhere a child is sleeping  
A child was born on christmas day  
To save the world from sadness  
His troubled life he gave  
To offer hope and gladness  
Our weary souls to save  
To comfort us in trouble  
To guide us ev'ryday  
One hope for life eternal  
A child was born on christmas day  
Long ago, far away  
In a stable bare  
Look and see he sleeps so peacefully  
As if the cold of night were never there  
Bless all the little children  
Where ever they may lay  
Somewhere a child is sleeping  
A child was born on christmas day.  
So we might love each other  
In peace and honor's way  
Somewhere a child is sleeping  
A child was born on christmas day.  

Song For The Mira  
Out on the Mira one warm afternoon  
Old men go fishing with black line and spoon  
And if they catch nothing they never complain  
I wish I was with them again  
As boys in their boats call to girls on the shore  
Teasing the one that they really adore  
And into the evening the courting begins  
I wish I was with them again  
Chorus:  
Can you imagine a piece of the universe  
More fit for princes and kings?  
I'll give you ten of your cities  
For Marion Bridge and the pleasure it brings  
Out on the Mira on soft summer nights  
Bonfires blaze to the children's delight  
They dance round the flames singing songs with their friends  
I wish I was with them again  
And over the ashes the stories are told  
Of witches and werewolves and Oak Island gold  
The stars on the river they sparkle and spin  
I wish I was with them again  
Chorus  
Out on the Mira the people are kind  
They'll treat you to home-brew and help you unwind  
And if you come broken they'll see that you mend  
I wish I was with them again  
And thus I conclude with a wish you go well  
Sweet be your dreams, may your happiness swell  
I'll leave you here, for my journey begins  
I'm going to be with them, going to be with them  
I'm going to be with them again  
  
  

Sonny, don't go away, I am here all alone  
And your daddy's a sailor who never comes home  
And the nights are so long and the silence goes on  
And I'm feelin' so tired, I'm not all that strong  
Sonny lives on a farm in a wide open space  
Kick off your sneakers and let go the race  
And you can lay down your head by a sweet river bed  
But Sonny always remembers what it was his mama said  
Sonny, don't go away, I am here all alone  
And your daddy's a sailor who never comes home  
And the nights are so long and the silence goes on  
And I'm feelin' so tired, I'm not all that strong  
Sonny carries a load, though he's barely a man  
There ain't much to do, yet he does what he can  
He watches the sea from a room by the stairs  
The waves keep on rollin', they've done that for years  
Sonny, don't go away, I am here all alone  
And your daddy's a sailor who never comes home  
And the nights are so long and the silence goes on  
And I'm feelin' so tired, I'm not all that strong  
It's a hundred miles to town, Sonny's never been there  
Yet he goes to the highway and stands there and stares  
And the mail comes at four and the mailman is old  
But he still keeps his dreams full of silver and gold  
Sonny, don't go away, I am here all alone  
And your daddy's a sailor who never comes home  
And the nights are so long and the silence goes on  
And I'm feelin' so tired, I'm not all that strong  
Sonny's dreams can't be real, they're just stories he's read  
They're just stars in his eyes, they're just dreams in his head  
Still he longs in his mind for the wild world outside  
And I know I can't hold him though I've tried  
And I've tried, and I've tried  
Sonny, don't go away, I am here all alone  
And your daddy's a sailor who never comes home  
And the nights are so long and the silence goes on  
And I'm feelin' so tired, I'm not all that strong  

Steal away let's steal away  
No reason left to stay  
For me and you  
Let's start a-new  
And darling steal away  
  
Steal away and chase some dreams  
And hope they never find us  
The dreary days  
The empty nights  
We'll leave them all behind us  
  
(Chorus)  
We'll leave behind the city streets  
The gloom and desolation  
The rain the cold  
Just growing old  
God knows it's a hard old station  
  
(Chorus)  
We'll leave with just a memory  
And make a new beginning  
We have to choose  
To win or lose  
And it's time we started winning  
  
(Chorus Repeat)

Sweet sister mary what is this I hear  
I hear that you're planning on leaving from here  
And I fear that it's true there's a great empty space  
Faces are crying all over the place  
Stay mary stay  
Tears and the rain and the dew occupy  
The valley sweet mary where you say goodbye  
Now while under the rain I was told by a fish  
Sweet mary your plan to allow me one wish  
Stay mary stay  
The sun never shines o'er this valley  
The mountains are crying all day  
The trees never change from the autumn  
Since mary said mary can't stay away, away, away  
Sweet sister mary the church closed the doors  
The men's brooms are sweeping the tears from the floors  
And I know you'll be missed but I think we'll survive  
Mary sweet mary may I say good-bye  
Bye mary bye  
Bye mary bye  
Bye mary bye  

Oh list to the strains of a poor Irish harper  
And scorn not the strings from his poor withered hand  
Oh remember his fingers could once move more sharper  
To raise up the memory of his dear native land  
At fair or at wake I would twist my shillelagh  
Or trip throughout he jig in my brogues bound with straw  
And all the pretty maids in the village and the valley  
Loved their bold Phelim Brady, the Bard of Armagh  
And when Sergeant Daeth in his cold arms shall embrace me  
And lull me to sleep with sweet with sweet Erin go bragh  
By the side of my Kathleen, my young young wife, oh then place me  
Then forget Phelim Brady, the Bard of Armagh  

The Cliffs of Dooneen: To Izabella and Tadeusz  
You may travel far from your own native home  
Far away o'er the mountains far away o'er the foam  
But of all the fine places that I've ever been  
There's none can compare with the cliffs of Dooneen  
It's a nice place to be on a fine summer's day  
Watching all the wild flowers that ne'er do decay  
Oh the hare and the pheasant are plain to be seen  
Making homes for their young round the cliffs of Dooneen  
Take a view o'er the mountain fine sites you'll see there  
Yes in a high rocky mountain in the west coast of Clair  
Oh the towns of Kilkee and Kilrush can be seen  
From the high rocky slopes round the cliffs of Dooneen  
So fare thee well to Dooneen fare thee well for a while  
And althoug we are parted by the ragin sea wild  
Once again I will wander with my Irisjh colleen  
Round the high rocky slopes of the cliffs of Dooneen

The Dutchman's not the kind of man  
To keep his thumb jammed in the dam  
That holds his dreams in  
But that's a secret only Margaret knows  
  
When Amsterdam is golden in the morning  
Margaret brings him breakfast  
She believes him  
He thinks the tulips bloom  
beneath the snows  
He's mad as he can be  
But Margaret only sees that sometimes  
Sometimes she sees her unborn children  
In his eyes  
  
(Chorus)  
Let us go to the banks of the ocean  
Where the walls rise above the Zuiderzee  
Long ago I used to be a young man  
And dear Margaret remembers for me.  
  
The Dutchman still wears wooden shoes  
His cap and his coat are patched with love  
That Margaret sewed in  
Sometimes he thinks he's still in Rotterdam  
  
He watches tug boats down canals  
And calls out to them  
When he thinks he knows the captain  
Til Margaret comes to take him home again  
Through unforgiving streets  
A tripping though she holds his arm.  
Sometimes he thinks that he's alone  
And calls her name  
  
(Chorus)  
The windmills swirl. The winter air  
She winds his muffler tighter  
They sit in the kitchen  
And the tea with wiskey keep away the dew  
He sees her for a moment, calls her name  
She makes his bed up  
Humming some old love song.  
She learned it when the tune was vey new  
He hums a line or two, they hum together in the night  
The Dutchman falls asleep  
And Margaret blows the candle out.

By a lonely prison wall  
I heard a young girl calling,  
'michael, they are taking you away.  
For you stole travelyns corn,  
So the young might see the morn,  
Now a prison ship lies waiting in the bay. '  
  
Chorus  
  
Low lie the fields of athenry  
Where once we watched the small freebirds fly.  
Our love was on the wing,  
We had dreams and songs to sing  
It's so lonely rond the fields of athenry  
  
By a lonely prison wall  
I heard a young man calling  
'nothing matters, mary when you're free  
Against the famine and the crown,  
I rebelled, they cut me down,  
Now you must raise our child with dignity. '  
  
Chorus  
  
By a lonely harbour wall,  
As she watched the last star falling  
As the prison ship said out against the sky  
For she lived in hope and prayed,  
For her love in botany bay  
It's so lonely round the fields of athenry  
  
Chorus  
  
It's so lonely round the fields of athenry
