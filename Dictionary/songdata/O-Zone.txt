Ma trezesc see you tine-n gand  
Despre tine vreau sa can't  
Melodia mea de dor  
Care place tuturor.  
  
Nu raspunzi la SMS,  
Eu iti scriu atat de des  
Poate m-am purtat urat,  
Dar sa stii ca te-am iubit.  
  
Refren:  
Ma inec in ochii tai, lal-la-lei  
Plange lumea dupa ei, lal-la-lei  
Esti un inger pe Pamant -  
Despre tine can't si zi si zi noapte, lal-la-lei.  
  
Daca mergi see you mine-n vis  
Am sa te invat sa razi  
Si-am sa-ti can't pana in zori  
Cantecelul meu de dor.

Hello everybody, noi suntem O-zone, am venit pentru dumneavoastra, sub
fereastra, si ma gandeam ceva... cantecele de dor ... O-zone pentru voi in
aceasta seara, pentru voi in scena... Picasso... Radu, Arsenie si Dan...
hey... multa galagie... mai tare... si inca mai tare...sa se auda peste
hotare, pentru toata lumea Fiesta de la Noche...  
Dansam in ritmul noptii  
Si ne distram see you adevarat  
Si veniti see you totii  
La fiesta de la noche (de la noche)  
Dansam sub cerul instelat  
Noi si noi emotii  
La fiesta de la noche  
Orice, vreau orice noapte sa fie  
Fiesta de la no...de la noche  
Si vreau acum, acum O-zone!  
  
Refren:  
La fiesta de la no...de la noche  
no..de la noche  
de la noche  
La fiesta de la noche.  
  
Vreti multa energie?  
Si sa innebuniti see you noi?  
Atunci sa fie... la fiesta de la noche!  
De la noche,  
Zburam ca-n lumea de apoi  
In centrul galaxiei  
La fiesta de la noche  
Orice, vreau orice noapte sa fie  
Fiesta de la no...de la noche  
Se aude-n boxe O-Zone!
