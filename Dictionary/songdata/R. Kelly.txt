Damn  
I want to go half on a baby

My time, my patience, my love  
My blood, my sweat, my tears  
My burdens, my drama, my pain  
My car, my money, my home  
My ups, my downs, my fears  
And my hours, my work, my strength  
My fault, my this, my that  
Nigga please  
  
[Chorus]  
If you don't stop  
(This is a warning)  
Someone's gonna lay in your bed  
(This is a warning)  
And someone's gonna eat your food  
(This is a warning)  
And someone's gonna wear your clothes  
(This is a warning)  
And someone's gonna fit your shoes  
(This is a warning)  
And someone's gonna get your keys  
(This is a warning)  
And someone's gonna open your doors  
(This is a warning)  
Someone's gonna get your check  
(This is a warning)  
This is a woman's threat  
Baby, this is a woman's threat  
  
My shakin', my sleep, my stress  
My days, my night, my rest  
My do's, my don'ts, my dares  
And my church, my pastor, my prayers  
My all, my faith, my powers  
And my kitchen, my sink, my towels  
My joy, my sad, my hate  
And my sister, my cousin, my friends  
My lights, my gas, my bills  
My role, my way, my will  
My hollerin', my fussin', my fights  
Nigga please  
  
[Chorus]  
  
My future, my hopes, my dreams  
My panties, my socks, my things  
My flowers, my dress, my ring  
My man, my lover, my king  
My live, my chance, my fault  
And my guts, my courage, my wounds  
My fence, my neighbors, my yard  
My chains, my lock, my guards  
My win, my lose, my gain  
And my credit, my card, my name  
Myself, my freedom, my roof  
Nigga please  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Listen  
(Whoa, whoa)  
Have you ever heard the story  
About the three little bears  
See they papa was gone  
For a long, long, long, long time  
When he returned  
To his sweet little home  
He had come to find  
That all of his porridge was gone  
  
[Chorus]

Baby, we been knowing each other for a long,  
long time for somethin' like this to just go and break up everything.  
  
Here we are, just sittin' here  
Knowin' we're all alone  
My Rolley's lookin' at me  
Sayin' it's time to get it on  
You know what I want  
And baby, I know what you need  
So stop hesitatin', girl  
And give your love to me.  
  
[Chorus]  
All I really want is to love you, babe  
Make your body feel like heaven, babe  
I just wanna satisfy ya, babe  
That's all I want, that's all I want  
I just wanna give ya somethin', babe  
Just wanna keep it comin', babe  
I just wanna make you happy, babe  
That's all I want, that's all I want.  
  
Though the fireplace is burnin' marshmallows just right  
To who it may concern  
You won't be comin' home tonight  
Body parts that he DON'T kiss  
Girl, I will kiss for you  
Just put this CD on the repeat  
And let me pamper you.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now the swimmin' pool's out back  
Come on and skinny dip, baby  
Eat breakfast in the morning  
That'll be complements of me  
In the middle of the night  
There's no need for morning here  
So hold your pillow tight  
Cause I wanna do it again and again.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Til the sun comes up)  
Baby, we'll be makin' love  
(And when the sun goes down)  
Still we won't have enough  
Take this love to you  
I will take care of all you need  
Baby, lets asure  
I just wanna set you free, free.  
  
[Chorus: Repeats]

Ohhh  
Lady Lady(rpt 8x)  
  
Verse 1  
  
Sitting by myself, in my cell of loneliness  
I'm caught up, in a worldwind  
Like a little girl, in a doggie pin  
Scratch a calender on the wall, just counting down the days  
That I'd head on back that way, Sayin  
  
Chorus  
  
All I wanna do(all I wanna do)  
Make it home to you  
Get it on with you  
All I wanna do(all I wanna do)  
Make it home to you  
Get it on with you  
  
Verse 2  
  
Now, sometimes we can be so selfish baby  
In our own little world  
And sometimes we have to go blind to see  
That it's both of our worlds  
And I refuse to be, somewhere in a lounge  
With my drunk head hangin down, Sayin All...  
  
Chorus  
  
All I wanna do(oooooooh)  
Make it home to you  
Get it on with you  
All I wanna do(is make it home babe)  
Make it home to you  
Get it on with you  
  
Bridge  
  
Soemtimes this road can be long  
So long, somebody, just hold on  
Keep holdin on, won't be long now  
Cuz I'll be comin around that mountain when I....  
  
Chorus(rpt til end)

Make up, and break up  
That's all we do  
Then we have sex, next thing you know  
Everything is cool  
Best of Both Worlds! Holla at your boy  
  
Like we always do about this time  
Uh-huh, yeah  
I know what you doin' ma  
Tryin to get in an argument with me so I can  
Do my mad thing, you want me to do my mad thing  
I understand, c'mon!  
  
[Chorus]  
Seems we're always arguing, but  
Right after the arguing we have, sex  
And somehow it's the best, yes  
Seems we're always arguing, but  
Right after the arguing we have, sex  
And somehow it's the best girl  
  
Gangsta love, gangsta love  
  
Think about it while the streets you roam  
It's Dom P and Army in the fridge when you get home  
Sex is always better fresh off a vendetta  
We break up or break you off then we right back together  
Then this brand new leathers and Caroline Aurera  
Marijuana, white wine, somewhere under the weather  
Like we sick but we fine, shit we couldn't feel better  
Just some sunshine in mind lookin fine as ever  
Who got a mouth on her, woo, she put some words together  
Sometimes'll make a nigga wanna leave, but when we make up  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Woo!  
Boy talk boy!  
  
Break up to make up baby  
Seems that's all we do darlin'  
But no one wants to walk out the door  
After all of the holla'n  
Cursing and fighting  
And me sleeping on the couch  
In the midst of our stormy weather  
Sex brings the sun out  
After I hit that there  
Seems we don't have a care  
Sex makes you say I'm sorry  
And things like I'm not goin' nowhere  
It's somethin' bout the P-U-S-S-Y  
That keeps brother in check, even I  
Even if you was a pimp you couldn't survive  
Without the H-E-L-P to provide you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Think about it while the streets you roam  
It's Dom P and Army in the fridge when you get home  
Remember that night? You was all like  
Maybe we should go our separate ways for life  
I hit the lights fit you tight at the lil' place right  
I hit it right you look me right in the eyes like psych  
You was goin' through your act 'til I caught you in the sack  
And I made you relax when I (hit it hard from the back)  
Yeah now we back friends  
And the next time you need some sex counselin', we  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Seems we're always arguing, but  
Right after the arguing we have, sex  
Sex with best friends  
From the bathroom to the kitchen (we sex)  
From the kitchen to living room (we sex)  
From the living room to upstairs (we sex)  
Upstairs to the attic (we sex)  
Attic to the basement (we sex)  
From the basement to the car garage (we sex)  
Garage to the back of the Jeep (we sex)  
Bicycle to the treadmill (we sex)  
Even over by the dirty lawnmower (we sex)  
The neighbors and the dogs are lookin crazy (we sex)  
I don't care because you're my baby (we sex)  
It's our house, and we can have sex (we sex)  
Anytime we want to (we sex)  
They can kiss my ass, because whoa-ho-hoo  
Hey L Don you feel me?  
  
Yeah yeah yeah I feel you  
You and Jay crazy man, but it's all good  
Let's go  
  
La-la-la-la-lah-la-la  
La-la-la-la-lah-la-la - sex  
La-la-la-la-lah-la-la  
La-la-la-la-lah-la-la - sex

[Chorus]  
You and me, havin sex  
After an argument, that shit's the best  
You and me, havin sex yeahh  
After an argument, that shit's the best  
(Think about it while the streets you roam  
It's Dom P and Army in the fridge when you get home)  
  
I storm in, she storm out  
It's like the "War of the Roses" goin on in my house  
It's a little separation but I know how to fix the situation  
Mami just sufferin from love deprevation  
So I gotta give her thug reperations  
Put it in the life until love leg is shakin  
Slow and passionate, 'til we forget what happens  
Then we laughin and we back friends  
  
You don't have to fuss and fight  
Why don't you just spend the night  
Baby let's just kiss and hug  
You know the words girl let's make up  
So much love to be made  
Instead of screamin, "Who's to blame?"  
Girl I don't wanna let you go, I need you so  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Girlfriend didn't believe me when I said I'd be back in a little  
Cause I had the Chris T on with the crease in the middle  
Plus a fresh cut and the freezin icicles  
On my wrist, on my hand, that's when shit hit the fan  
Said, "You never spend timey, what's up with that?"  
Translated it means  
Hit it hard from the back  
Yeah she hid my car keys  
And forced me to fall asleep to her heartbeat  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I don't want baby I don't want to fight  
I just want to make it right (ooh yeah)  
Put out problems to the side  
Let's just make sweet love tonight (I don't want)  
Baby I don't want to fight  
I just want to make it right (ohhhhh love)  
Put our problems to the side  
Let's just make sweet love tonight  
  
Sex so intense, all that's on my mind  
It ain't feel this good since the very first time  
I'm pullin her close, she's pullin away  
I'm tryin to kiss her mouth but she keeps turnin her face  
Cute sex game like our very first date  
We ain't know each other well enough, we had to wait  
But oh! I know just where your hot spot at  
You can not deny that, so do not try that  
I do not buy that  
  
[Chorus]

My mind is tellin me no but my body my body's tellin me yes  
I (baby) don't want to hurt nobody  
But there is something that I must confess........... (chill)  
  
[Chorus: repeat 4x]  
I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind  
I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind  
  
See I know just what you want and I know just what you need girl  
So baby bring your body to me (bring your body here)  
I'm not fooling around with you baby  
My love is true (with you) with you is where I want to be, girl see  
I need someone someone like me to satisfy your every needs  
  
[Chorus 4x]  
You say he's not treating you right  
Then lady spend the night now  
I'll love you like you need to be love (girl why don't you try some of me)  
No need to look no more because I've opened up in my door  
You'll never feel another love you see  
I need someone, someone like me girl to make love to you baby constantly  
  
[Chorus 4x]  

Oh, oh, oh, oh

And when you drop it

Baby, I never seen nobody like you  
You're a good friend, you know, you've been there for me  
From the beginning, that's why I love you  
I mean I place no one above you, no what I'm sayin'?  
Anything you want, you just come to Daddy  
Listen  
  
When I discovered you I discovered a piece within  
A joy like no other, you are my closest friend  
Girl, if you were a number you'd be a perfect 10  
Right out of the blue sky you were heaven sent  
The way we make love over and over again  
If I had to describe it there'd be nowhere to begin  
And I'm so proud to be your next of kin  
Bring a train over me when I had no reason  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, plenty caramel coated taffies  
Chocolate covered strawberries  
Love so sweet  
You're my chocolate factory  
Gumdrops mixed with chocolate milk bars  
There's so much variety, love so sweet  
You're my chocolate factory  
  
Now if I could write a book on how you made me feel  
The title would read a strong black man and that's for real  
I been going round and round just like a Ferris wheel  
And in and out of relationships with out appeal  
Ain't nobody else on Gods green earth for me  
If we turn ourselves together, we'll make the perfect team of dreams  
Change me for the world as long as I exist  
Always in the kitchen cookin' up my favorite meal  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You're that puzzle piece that completes me (girl something so sweet)  
Girl you're everything (girl you're everything that I need)  
You're my escape when I want to be free (when I want to be free)  
You full of plenty treats (like peppers and sweet tarts, big blue red hot)  
Baby you are  
  
[Chorus: x3]

Sunny days, I promised you  
Life's window pane  
With a perfect view  
A vow to love, unconditional  
Be there for you, all season  
  
And I never meant to clip your wings, oh my love  
And I never meant to clip your wings, oh my love  
Baby I never meant to clip your wings, ooh baby  
Now I'm wishing you  
You would fly right back to me, yeah  
  
I made a vow to walk with you  
Through anything life puts you through  
Told you the world is yours and everything in it  
Then took your heart for granted  
  
And baby I never meant to clip your wings, never  
Baby I never meant to clip your wings  
Baby I never meant to clip your wings  
Now I'm wishing you  
You could fly right back to me, yeah  
  
I was your eagle, you were my dove yeah  
And nothing would come between us, no, no, no  
Now the fun and laughter, going to the park  
And all the pictures we took  
Now it's all gone away  
  
And baby I never meant to clip your wings, oh baby  
I never meant to clip your wings, oh my love  
And baby I, I never meant to clip your wings  
Now I'm wishing you  
You could fly right back to me, yeah  
  
Baby, baby, baby, baby  
I never meant to clip your wings, oh my love  
Baby girl I never,  
Meant to clip the wings of an angel  
When I was supposed to love you baby  
For eternity  
Now I'm wishing you  
You could fly right back to me, yeah

Oooooooooooh (I know what you're going through)  
Come to me (I can see it in tour eyes)  
Oh baby (c'mon)

Well it's obvious to me that he don't love you  
Baby can't you see I'm that player for you  
Baby talk to me help me understand  
How can you go on putin up with this man  
Going out your way to make him happy  
Don't'appreciate all that you give  
Time to take a stand no more second chance  
If you feel this way than baby take my hand  
  
Chorus Come to daddy let me  
Please your body tonight

Come to daddy let me (let me)

She was a country girl from Clebourne, Texas  
In a big city and she like my necklace  
So we started talking while we took a ride  
In a big pick-up truck and my hat was to the side.  
She was a country girl from the class of '96  
A big booty with some big ol' country tits  
A country name with some country attitude  
Say "yes ma'am" but at times she's kinda rude.  
A daddy's girl so I had to watch my ass.  
6 three Mr. Hill would whoop my ass.  
We can't kick it I'm a city kid  
Imagine what would happen if he knew what we did  
(What we did)  
  
-[Chorus:]-  
I fell in love with a country girl  
A city kid in a different world  
I fell in love with a country girl  
A city kid in a different world  
I fell in love with a country girl  
A city kid in a different world  
I fell in love with a country girl  
A city kid in a different world  
  
She likes country livin' and acoustic guitars  
And Kenny Chesney and country bars  
And Cadillac's and I couldn't relate  
I'm just a concrete kid on a country date  
And her dad hated me... oh I knew it.  
He didn't like my tattoos, pierced ears, and black music.  
We still cow-tippin' and trippin'  
With that brush papa shirt lit back cause she was pimpin  
She was a country girl home cookin' and grubbin'  
Aint used to my style big limos and clubbin'  
A city kid and I'm doin' my thang  
I like an old country girl this is how I sing.  
  
-[Chorus:]-  
I fell in love with a country girl  
A city kid in a different world  
I fell in love with a country girl  
A city kid in a different world  
I fell in love with a country girl  
A city kid in a different world  
I fell in love with a country girl  
A city kid in a different world  
  
A country girl cut off jeans and lolly pops  
Tequila shots, tube tops and liquor stops  
A country girl with them country ways  
Livin' big city nights  
But them country days  
A country girl don't understand thuggin  
A country girl tractors and beer chuggin  
A country girl pig-tails and care-free  
No direct dish just channel 3  
(Come on, this the only channel you have?)  
  
-[Chorus:]-  
I fell in love with a country girl  
A city kid in a different world  
I fell in love with a country girl  
A city kid in a different world  
I fell in love with a country girl  
A city kid in a different world  
I fell in love with a country girl  
A city kid in a differenty world  
  
Country Girls taste like chicken....

Aye-aye, aye-aye  
Aye-aye, aye, uh  
  
Stupid, look at you now  
You screwed it all up  
You kept gamblin'  
And ran out of luck  
You thought you was strong  
Thought you was so tough  
And now all you've got  
Is your pride to hold  
And that's not enough  
  
Uh, never seen this kind of rain  
This change is so strange  
Though I feel your absence  
It's like a numb pain  
Girl, I want to feel again  
  
I don't want to be here  
Doin' dishes, dishes  
Doin' dishes  
I don't want to be here  
Doin' dishes, dishes  
Doin' dishes  
I don't want to be, no  
  
Sos, sos  
Call sos, sos  
Callin' sos, sos  
Call sos, sos  
  
She gave you the world  
And you threw it away  
Plus she was your girl  
And you're engaged  
Inseparable through holiday  
Now she's invisible  
Gone away  
  
I've been hit by a truck  
And I'm bleeding inside  
The cure is too far away  
And I'm about to die  
  
Never seen this kind of rain  
Ooh, this change is so strange  
Though I feel your absence  
It's like a numb pain, yeah  
Girl, I want to feel again  
  
I don't want to be here  
Doin' dishes, dishes  
Doin' dishes  
I don't want to be here  
Doin' dishes, dishes  
Doin' dishes, no  
I don't want to be, no  
  
By the time the sun rise again, (rise again)  
I'm hoping you will be with me, cause  
I don't want to go on without you  
And I don't want to live here without you  
  
I don't want to be here  
Doin' dishes, dishes  
Doin' dishes  
I don't want to be here  
Doin' dishes, dishes  
Doin' dishes  
  
I don't want to be here  
Doin' dishes, dishes  
Doin' dishes  
I don't want to be here  
Doin' dishes, dishes  
Doin' dishes

Kells, you know I can't keep doing this, I got to say something  
You feel me, see I just can't keep living life confused, girl  
You gotta make a move, tell me something, 'cause I'm  
First you wanna go then you wanna stay  
And then you wanna talk about it baby  
Put your bag down and pick your bag up  
And then you just walk out on me baby  
If love were eyes, then I can see your future  
In what we're doing baby  
Girl I'm not trying to confuse  
Just wanna spend my life with you baby  
Girl please tell me where do we go from here  
Girl, I wanna change your name to my name  
And I know you feel the same way so  
Girl let's just go, get far away from here  
Let it beat, let our hearts beat, take a deep breath  
Now baby hold on and girl don't let go  
Yeah, just keep holding on  
Baby, we'll walk through the storm together, oh yeah  
Girl I promise you this love is forever  
First you say you love me  
And then you say well, I don't know, what  
We both feel the same  
So baby what the hell, let's go, what  
You holler at your friends, I'll handle the streets  
Let's just let them on, oh, what  
Girl I gotta be with you if I'm gonna be free  
'Cause you are my soul, yeah  
Girl please tell me where do we go from here  
Girl, I wanna change your name to my name  
And I know your feelin' the same way too  
Girl let's just go, get far away from here  
Let it beat, let our hearts beat, just take a deep breath  
Now baby hold on and girl don't let go  
You just keep holding on, oh yeah  
Girl we'll walk through the storm together, hey  
And I promise this love is forever  
Although we come from two different worlds, oh  
Baby, that doesn't matter to me 'cause my world is you, yeah  
Whose gonna doubt that we would get this far  
And I don't care what the world may say,  
It's you and me against all odds  
Hold on and baby be strong  
We can make it maybe if we just hold on  
We'll walk through the storm, yeah  
Just hold on, just hold on, hold on, just hold on  
We're gonna make it babe, we're gonna make it babe  
We're gonna make it babe, we're gonna make it babe, what  
We're gonna make it babe, we're gonna make it babe  
We're gonna make it babe, we're gonna make it babe, what  
We're gonna make it babe, we're gonna make it babe  
We're gonna make it babe, we're gonna make it babe  

Seems like we're done here  
Looks like that's everything  
She walks by, one last time,  
Checks for her things and leave the keys behind  
There will be more tears  
As she's beginning to drive away  
Its all clear now, there's no real reason to have the pain  
Now I know love has kept me here, and my pride has kept me here  
And hope keeps singing it's alright, I'll be fine  
  
But she'll be going elsewhere  
And she'll be lying else where  
And she'll be wanted elsewhere  
And I'll be somewhere thinking about her  
And she'll be living elsewhere  
And she'll be laughing elsewhere  
And shell be happy elsewhere  
And I'll be just fine without her, someday  
  
That's what I keep telling myself  
  
Was it the right thing  
Was this our biggest mistake  
Still call sometimes but she's got nothing to say, And still she stays away  
It's got me questioning, if I ever meant the same to her  
How could she, Why would she  
Do these things put me through this pain now  
If love is what we have then how could it have been so bad  
That she don't think it's not worth a fight, she won't try  
  
But she'll be trying elsewhere  
And she'll be loving elsewhere  
And she'll keep secrets elsewhere  
And I'll be somewhere thinking about her  
And shell be willing elsewhere  
And shell be giving elsewhere  
And she'll have feelings elsewhere  
But hope keeps saying kells you can make it  
  
But in the meantime I can't sleep I can't think  
There's so many things in my head  
Things she said, things that she meant  
Things that I started feeling the day that she left  
Things that I slept on  
Things that I should have accepted  
Things I expected and the things I neglected  
I better get up off my ass  
Get first flight out, and get her back  
  
Or else  
  
She'll be living elsewhere  
And she'll be crying elsewhere  
And shell be feeling elsewhere  
And I'll be somewhere thinking about her  
She'll be smiling elsewhere  
And she'll be laughing elsewhere  
Giving all of my sweet love away elsewhere  
That's the reason why I gotta catch that flight  
? I'm out of time?

Baby, I'm so glad you're over here  
Now I get to show you all the things  
That I been wanting to show you for such a long time  
Don't say nothin'  
  
Picture this you and me in the kitchen babe, on the counter  
Feeding each other fruits babe  
Straight from there walk into the bedroom babe  
I touch your hair and then you turn around and say what's on your mind  
And girl tonight we'll be making sweet love  
  
[Chorus]  
Girl tonight we'll make sweet love  
Until the rain comes falling down on you and me  
All of these things and etcetera etcetera etcetera  
Wanna kiss you places you want me to  
Promise girl that I'll do all of these things  
And etcetera etcetera etcetera  
  
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo  
Doing you pretty much all night long babe  
'Till I hear you screaming my name babe  
In the pool you and me skinny dipping darlin' Kelly's rules  
No playing hard to get now tell me what the deal 'cause  
Girl tonight we'll be making sweet love  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Put on some clothes and lets go to the IHOP, baby  
(Let's go to the IHOP babe)  
No, no, no (Baby we just made love)  
No matter how good the food may taste  
(No matter how the food may taste)  
I'm still thinking about your body baby, yes I am  
(It's your body I'm thinking of)  
  
[Chorus]

Now I can't leave this club without you girl  
Swear I want more  
You deserve an encore  
Back stage VIP shopping  
Now it's raining  
Won't you come and tell me how you with it  
What you want girl you can get it  
These clubbers won't treat you like I treat you  
Big chips, black cards you'll be my pool star  
Somebody say you looking for me, girl here I go  
  
Oh look at oh my god  
Who do we have  
Up in the club dancing for me?  
Girl let me help you chase your dreams  
You're so beautiful  
  
(How can I make you understand)  
Ooh that I want to rub, I want to touch,  
Every little inch of your body  
(Body)  
Girl if you go with me  
You're incredible, girl  
(Oh yes you are)  
  
Baby see the exit, exit, see the exit, let's go, out this club  
Exit, exit, exit, see the exit, let's go out this club, exit  
  
Now baby girl if that's your man forget about it go on and dance  
And I really didn't mean no harm  
It's just a player's charm  
Any girl and I do it rather well,  
Closing every bar like a professor baby  
Kells gives sex seminars  
When you walk by so slow make me whistle  
(You've got pretty teeth)  
And I feel so good when you smile at me yea  
I'm about to write you everything  
Baby girl please just go with me  
I've got a big house in the mountains lets go  
And I've even got a stripper pole  
Excuse me miss somebody says you're looking for me, girl here I go  
  
Oh look oh my gosh who do we have up in the club dancing for me  
Why you upstaging these chicks?  
Girl you've got the dance... order  
How can I make you understand?  
Ooo that I want to rub  
I want to touch every little inch of your body (body)  
Girl you need to go with me  
It's the last call, for alcohol girl  
(yes it is)  
  
Girl can you see the exit, exit,  
See the exit, lets go out this club  
Exit, exit, exit see the exit  
Lets go out this club, exit  
  
When you see me,  
Tour bus your block,  
Back of maybach  
Black shades on down low in your hood  
Smoking on that good  
  
Go take a picture, autograph,  
Crack some jokes, make me laugh  
Take some shots baby now  
Come to my hotel  
Girl I love the way you're teasing me,  
You and your girlfriend on the dance floor  
I'm thinkin' menagitwa  
So wantchu jump up off of my car  
Girl it's so pretty, leather interior, custom made for me,  
Let the top of that go back, then pull up the the club real slow  
So the fans can take a flick,  
Girl I get a kick out of splurging on you  
Nordstrom, Prada, Gucci, Fendi, Vicki Secret too  
Baby skies the limit where we go from here  
Once were in the Benz, now take me serious when I say  
I'm gonna walk out of here with you  
  
When you see the exit, exit, see the exit, lets go out this club  
Exit, exit, exit see the exit lets go out this club  
Exit (exit)  
(yea)

I don't know how to make it stop, no  
  
I got a phobia when it comes to heights  
Even if it's a first class flight  
And as a kid, I never really liked to climb  
If you pushed me hard on a swing, then I'd cry  
  
If I had a dream that I was flying,  
Then I'd wake up in a panic, screaming  
  
And now you take me up and away with you  
Push me out of the plane with no parachute  
And now I'm gonna need somebody to catch me  
It's like I'm falling from the sky (sky, sky)  
I'm falling from the sky (sky, sky)  
It's like I'm falling form the sky (sky, sky)  
And I need somebody to catch me  
  
Catch me, when I come down (down, down, down)  
When I come down (down, down, down)  
When I come down (down, down, down)  
Will you catch me?  
When I come down (down, down, down)  
When I come down  
  
I never ever wanted to climb a ladder  
And I never wanted a house in the hills  
I'm comfortable living in a big high rise  
'Cause in nightmares of getting killed  
I never wanted to swim, the water there was too deep  
Put me up on the roof, you couldn't pay me to leave  
Even if I was bummin' on the streets  
You couldn't pay me to leave  
  
And now you take me up and away with you  
Push me out of the plane with no parachute  
And now I'm gonna need somebody to catch me  
It's like I'm falling from the sky (sky, sky)  
I'm falling from the sky (sky, sky)  
It's like I'm falling form the sky (sky, sky)  
And I need somebody to catch me  
  
Catch me, when I come down (down, down, down)  
When I come down (down, down, down)  
When I come down (down, down, down)  
Will you catch me?  
When I come down (down, down, down)  
When I come down  
  
Girl I'm running out of time, come back around  
Only a few seconds before I hit the ground  
How do you expect me to fly when you are my wings?  
Oh I can't breathe, no  
Baby it's like I'm dreaming, got nothing to hold on to  
I can't wake up girl, laying next to you  
I can't think, I can't sleep, I can't eat  
  
It's like I'm falling from the sky (sky, sky)  
I'm falling from the sky (sky, sky)  
It's like I'm falling form the sky (sky, sky)  
And I need somebody to catch me  
Catch me, when I come down (down, down, down)  
When I come down (down, down, down)  
When I come down (down, down, down)  
Will you catch me?  
When I come down (down, down, down)  
When I come down  
  
Girl it's like I'm falling from the sky (sky, sky)  
I'm falling from the sky (sky, sky)  
It's like I'm falling form the sky (sky, sky)  
And I need somebody to catch me  
Catch me, when I come down (down, down, down)  
When I come down (down, down, down)  
When I come down (down, down, down)  
Will you catch me?  
When I come down (down, down, down)  
When I come down

Mansions, hill and acres  
Women, drinks and caterers  
I would toast until the break of dawn  
Swimming pools and strippers  
Conversation six figures  
Never crossed my mind to call home.  
  
[Chorus]  
There's a note on the bathroom mirror  
Telling me that you've had enough.  
  
It took you leaving me  
For my blind eyes to see that you mean.  
  
[Repeat: x8]  
Far more  
  
Than this planet to me  
Than the air I breath  
From here to overseas  
Girl you're all I need  
Than the mountains and trees  
You mean more than the birds and the bees  
Honey take it from me  
You are all I need  
  
Hanging out with friends  
Never calling to check in  
Neglecting you in every way  
Taking the home front for granted  
What was straight, is now slanted  
And I don't know what to do about this letter.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It took you leaving me  
For my blind eyes to see that you mean.  
  
[Repeat: x8]  
Far More  
  
More than this planet to me  
More than the air I breath  
From here to overseas  
Girl you're all I need  
Than the mountains and trees  
You mean more than the birds and the bees  
Honey take it from me  
You are all I need  
  
[Repeat: x8]  
Far more  
  
Ever since you've been gone  
I realize girl just what it is I had at home  
Oh Baby, you mean far more  
Than this planet to me  
Than this air I breath  
Nothing can compare to your love for me.  
To your love for me  
To your love for me  
To your love for me

[Chorus]  
This is my song for real no doubt  
See the DJ is making me feel thugged out  
As I walk you to dance floor  
We begin to dance slow  
You put your arms around me  
I'm feeling on yo booty  
  
Hey pretty mama how you doing  
Said I'm just in town for the weekend  
Looking for a lil' trouble to get into  
Baby tell me what ya drinking and I got you  
  
Players want to play,  
Ballers want to ball,  
Rollers want to roll,  
But I'm taking all, after I dance  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Now yo body got me feeling like spending  
With a backroom I could come to live in  
And yo hair weave's looking kinda pretty (pretty)  
The way you back up on me baby Lord have mercy!  
  
Players want to play,  
Ballers want to ball (Ballers want to ball)  
Rollers want to roll,  
But I'm taking all, after I dance (yeah, whoa)  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
If it's yo birthday, then put yo hands up  
You want to get drunk, then put yo hands up  
And if you got some cash, put yo hands up  
And your own job, put yo hands up (Players want to play)  
  
Players want to play  
Ballers want to ball (Ballers want to ball)  
Rollers want to roll (Feel so good, say it again)  
  
Players want to play,  
Ballers want to ball (oh)  
Rollers want to roll  
But I'm taking all, after I dance (oh yeah)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
This is my song for real no doubt  
See the DJ is making me feel thugged out (Feeling thugged out)  
As I walk you t the dance floor (Walk you to the dance floor)  
We begin to dance slow (We begin to dance slow)  
You put yo arms around me (Put yo arms around me)

And I hope you like it girl)  
  
This is my song for real no doubt  
See the DJ is making me feel (And I hope you like girl) thugged out  
As I walk you to the dance (Walk you to the dance) floor

I can't believe you're playing me like this,  
I thought the love we shared, the good times we had, remember?  
Yeah  
  
Feels like it's over,  
My heart tells me she's in love with someone else.  
Gave me the cold shoulder  
But this I lost 'cause I can find me somebody else  
  
If she wanna hit the town  
And party all night with her friends  
If she wanna fool around  
Then two can play that game baby  
  
You got me feeling single,  
About to give up  
Find somebody  
Who's gonna love me, girl  
Feeling single,  
Night is young,  
Hit the club  
Take somebody home with me  
  
Get it, get it  
Get it, get it  
We can get it, baby  
Get it, get it  
Now I'm better single  
  
She said forever  
Turned out to be the biggest lie  
Of all time  
And she changed my weather  
Rainin' all day  
No chance of sunshine  
  
If she wanna hit the town  
And party all night with her friends  
If she wanna fool around,  
Then two can play that game baby  
  
You got me feeling single  
Feeling single,  
About to give up  
Find somebody  
Who's gonna love me  
Feeling single,  
Night is young,  
Hit the club  
And take somebody home with me  
  
Get it, get it  
Get it, get it  
Till the morning, baby  
Get it get it  
Now I'm feeling single  
  
The way I see it, girl, not gonna do right  
About me, baby girl  
And I might as well (I might as well)  
I might as well get out and mingle, girl  
'Cause you got, you got, you got me feeling single  
  
Yeah  
And I don't wanna do it, baby,  
But you're gonna make me  
Find somebody  
Who's gonna love me,  
Treat me right, baby  
Be in my house, in my room, in my bed, in my arms at night baby  
And she's gonna love me, baby  
And she's gonna give all lovin' lovin', baby

Everything ain't hardcore you know  
I can't sing but my man  
I'ma let my man smooth that thang out for you  
You know, take the edge off, you know what I'm sayin'?  
  
All my sexy ladies throw ya hands up high  
And all my real playas throw ya hands up high  
And just keep on bouncin' while I take you on a ride  
  
[Chorus]  
It's like your body's on radio I'm feelin' you in stereo  
Put me in your cd player I'm gonna hit it nice and slow  
Baby I'm your hot mix bumpin' in your cherry Lex  
Checkin' out your widescreen while your hands up on the headrest

Tryin' to come up with a melody that will turn you on  
On the MPC3000 tryin' to come up with beats  
That'll make come on over here and lay down here with me  
I'm searchin' for that special mind blowin' melody  
And it's gotta be sexy so I'll think it through carefully  
It's like I'm tryin' to tune it, to ya station babe  
Try to get you to play, this record babe  
Every time I hear this track girl I think about me and you  
In the Maybach doin' what we do  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Um, now I know a few friends of mine that has made love to this record  
So when you're in the mood call the station, request this record  
She walks in the room, says "'Ly I can't breathe"  
As I try to catch my breath and proceed  
Lookin' at yo' sexy smile, while I put my vocals down  
Girl you have made this song a hit in each and every town  
You a sexy melody with a touch of freakin' harmony  
Such a perfect chemistry  
Girl we deserve a Grammy, or Soul Train  
Billboard, MTV or BET award  
Rollin' like we on a tour  
Ooh the way you put it down girl I can't take it  
Sex was so good girl we've got to do the remix  
'Cause girl you a mix master  
When it comes to pumpin' you such a ghetto blaster  
It's such a hit that I gotta bootleg it, yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
  
A melody is the chemistry, the way we click  
It's like four part harmony and all that shit  
Your waistline is the bassline, I ride that shit  
Strung off your treble and I'm high as shit  
We made love in the studio when we got together over and over again like a
loop  
Damn I'm missin' you, it's hard to listen to

And I'll go there on this chair  
  
[Chorus: Repeats]

I guess is better to be in love and not...  
It doesn't matter, lay awake,  
Say your prayer for good and sake,  
Don't know how much I can take!  
No one ever said love was fair, what we could choose?  
But the last thing I thought about was losing you  
And I think about it all the time  
The girl is messing with my mind,  
That's why they say love is blind!  
  
Bridge:  
I'm on in the middle... Like a fiddle,  
Hear the volume and the cry!  
Momma said to have patience,  
Love is sick as a patient  
I don't understand why  
  
Chorus:  
We've been going through these changes,  
Acting like the strangers,  
Never pass a point, no turning back  
We hold so much anger, our love this in danger  
Never pass a point, no turning back  
You don't wanna save me, seems like only yesterday  
Never pass a point, no turning back  
... You feel the same as I do,  
Never pass a point, no turning back  
  
My heart was a lock, your love a key,  
So much hurt on my chest, feel like I can breathe.  
Should I pressure forward with me, I wanna leave,  
Instead of living a life full of...  
I know that every relationship knows ups and downs,  
But saying... Come back around  
To the moment...  
You will feel the same, hey!  
  
Bridge:  
I'm on in the middle... Like a fiddle,  
Hear the volume and the cry!  
Momma said to have patience,  
Love is sick as a patient  
I don't understand why  
  
Chorus:  
We've been going through these changes,  
Acting like the strangers,  
Never pass a point, no turning back  
We hold so much anger, our love this in danger  
Never pass a point, no turning back  
You don't wanna save me, seems like only yesterday  
Never pass a point, no turning back  
... You feel the same as I do,  
Never pass a point, no turning back  
  
I'm trying to be...  
I'm trying to be the man,  
I'm trying to be the one you could talk to.  
I'm trying to understand  
After all the arguing, be the best I can!  
But everything... Just wasn't right for you  
So what I gotta do!  
Hey, even made the sacrifice,  
... Just wasn't right,...  
  
Chorus:  
We've been going through these changes,  
Acting like the strangers,  
Never pass a point, no turning back  
We hold so much anger, our love this in danger  
Never pass a point, no turning back  
You don't wanna save me, seems like only yesterday  
Never pass a point, no turning back  
... You feel the same as I do,  
Never pass a point, no turning back

Take a trip down town between me and you  
Sipping Don Perigdon

Making future plans, to be where I dwell

To my knee cap (to my knee caps, to waistline)

What I'm gonna do with both these girls  
Hard to choose between her and these streets  
'Cause the game keeps calling me  
  
[Verse 2]  
Baby girl had me off my grind, off my clock  
I would often find I was off my block  
Couldn't keep her off my mind, my balls were shot  
They never thought that a pause or stop  
  
Was in my pores to push rock raw  
Take a lost rebound like Bo Outlaw, I'm so outlaw  
Got a hunger for this game, but keep that on the low  
Like a one against the grain  
  
Got the sun against my brain  
A girl in my ear  
I like her for her  
I'm a dig into this shit, I like it like I like her  
  
Sometimes I can't figure it out  
I'm in love with the life but she's sticking it out  
She know want to hug kisses keep a nigga in the house  
Lock down while his niggas is out (out)

[Chorus]

You made the sun,  
You made the moon,  
Gave seasons change,  
Woah  
You made the clouds,  
You put the rainbow after rain  
Woah  
Created time,  
Now this ones mine,  
Gave pictures frames,  
Woah  
Created man gave him woman,  
Why did you do that for me?  
  
These are the questions asked before I lay me down and go to sleep, (ooh
sometimes I wonder)  
Sometimes I wonder why you decided to keep you hands on me.  
Of all the miracles, signs and wonders,  
There's still one mystery,  
How did you manage to love me?  
  
You breathed the life right into me,  
Then made my heart beat,  
Woah  
Created the mountains,  
And all of the deep seas,  
Flowers in the trees,  
Woah  
You made tommorrow come again,  
You calmed the strong winds,  
Woah  
And after all I've done,  
Gave me a son,  
Tell me why would you do that for me?  
  
These are the questions asked before I lay me down and go to sleep,  
(Right in the middle of my prayers)  
Sometimes I wonder why you decided to keep you hands on me.  
Of all the miracles, signs and wonders,  
There's still one mystery,  
How did you manage to love me? (how did you manage that?)  
How did you manage to love me?  
  
Said I've got to know how (how did you manage to love?)  
After all that I have done, oh Lord  
How? (how did you manage to love?)  
How could I have been so bad, oh Lord  
How? (how did you manage to forgive me?)  
Even when I didn't believe in me you believed in me Lord.  
How? (how did you manage to forgive me?)  
Jesus you sacrificed your dear life for me.  
(How did you manage to forgive me?)  
Ooooh Lord tell me (why did the pain uprise for me)

How do I tell her that I'm gonna wait?  
When I know that she'll be begging me to stay.  
And how do I tell her, that the time has come to part?  
When she's, she's gonna take it so hard.  
I don't wanna break her heart,  
I don't wanna see her cry!  
Cause I promised her forever,  
That I'll be by her side.  
  
So, how do I tell her, tell her goodbye?  
Oh yeah!  
  
How do I tell her that my path is gonna change,  
When I know that her heart won't be able to stand the pain?  
And how do I tell her that I'm moving on with my life,  
When she's just gonna break down and die?  
Oh, I don't wanna break her heart, no!  
I don't wanna break her heart,  
I don't wanna see her cry!  
When I promised a girl forever I'll be by her side?  
  
So, how do I tell her, tell her goodbye?  
Oh yeah!  
  
Listen!  
She's been forever faithful, hones and true,  
Yes she was!  
My god, this is gonna be the worst thing that I ever had to do!  
How, how, how, how, how?  
How do I tell her, oh, that the time has come to part,  
When I know she's gonna take it so very bad?  
Yes she is!  
I don't wanna break her heart,  
I don't wanna see her cry!  
When I promised her forever,  
That I'll be by her side.  
  
How do I tell her, tell her, tell her goodbye?  
Bye, bye, oh baby, bye!  
How do I tell her, how do I tell her, goodbye babe?  
I want somebody tell me,  
How do I tell her, girl?  
Bye, bye baby!  
Bye, bye babe!  
Bye, bye babe!  
Bye, bye babe!

Let me see you hump and bounce  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Help me find a way to that spot tonight  
Kelly, won't you help me find a way  
I can help you find a way

Yeah  
Uh, uh  
Uh  
Yeah  
Yeah  
  
There could be dark clouds up over me, yeah  
Still I know I can stand tall, yeah  
And I can be the only man in the middle of the sea  
And still somehow I wouldn't feel small, no, no  
  
Ever since I found you, baby, it's been my attitude,  
Yes, it has  
I wouldn't trade you for the world, uh-uh  
If I bet my money on you, baby, I would never lose, no  
'Cause you're my inspiration, girl  
With you by my side, I believe  
  
(Oh, I believe) I believe  
(Oh, I believe) Yes, I  
(I believe) I believe  
(Oh, I believe) Oh, I believe  
(Oh, I believe) I believe  
(I believe) Yes, I  
  
Now there could be a roadblock right in front of me,  
Mmm  
And it wouldn't be in my way, no  
Even if they locked me up and threw away the key, yeah  
Somehow I know it would be okay, yeah  
  
'Cause ever since I met you, girl, I've been positive,  
Oh, yes  
You gave me a reason why, yes, you did  
I kinda gave up on life, but now I wanna live, yeah  
'Cause in the tunnel you were my light  
And with you by my side, I believe  
  
(Oh, I believe) Oh, I believe  
(Oh, I believe) Oh, I believe, yeah  
(I believe) I believe  
(Oh, I believe) Woo I  
(Oh, I believe) I believe  
(I believe) Oh, ho, I believe  
  
And I remember when I wrote this song  
It was at a time when I, I couldn't go wrong  
But since I met you  
  
(Oh, I believe) I believe  
(Oh, I believe) Said I  
(I believe) I believe  
(Oh, I believe) Oh, I believe  
(Oh, I believe) Yeah  
(I believe) Yes, I, when the clouds are hanging over  
Us, woo  
  
(Oh, I believe) And the going's tough  
(Oh, I believe) I  
(I believe) I believe  
(Oh, I believe) If we stand tall, yeah  
(Oh, I believe) I believe, yeah  
(I believe) I believe  
  
(Oh, I believe) I believe, yeah  
(Oh, I believe) I believe  
(I believe) Oh, I believe

(Oh, I believe) Whoa, oh, I believe  
(I believe) I believe, Yes, I do  
  
(Oh, I believe) If the mountain's too high and the  
Valley's too low  
(Oh, I believe) We can do all things  
(I believe) If we believe  
(Oh, I believe) Ho, whoa, I believe  
(Oh, I believe) Hey, yea, ey, yea  
(I believe) Hey, I believe  
  
(Oh, I believe) Said America  
(Oh, I believe) America  
(I believe) Ooh  
(Oh, I believe)  
(Oh, I believe)

I used to think that I could not go on  
And life was nothing but an awful song  
But now I know the meaning of true love  
I'm leaning on the everlasting arms  
  
If I can see it, then I can do it  
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it  
  
I believe I can fly  
I believe I can touch the sky  
I think about it every night and day (Night and day)  
Spread my wings and fly away  
I believe I can soar  
I see me running through that open door  
I believe I can fly  
I believe I can fly  
I believe I can fly hoo  
  
See I was on the verge of breaking down  
Sometimes silence can seem so loud  
There are miracles in life I must achieve  
But first I know it starts inside of me, ho oh  
  
If I can see it hoo, then I can be it  
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it  
  
I believe I can fly  
I believe I can touch the sky  
I think about it every night and day  
Spread my wings and fly away  
I believe I can soar  
I see me running through that open door  
I believe I can fly  
I believe I can fly  
Oh, I believe I can fly hoo  
  
Hey, cause I believe in me, oh  
  
If I can see it hoo, then I can do it  
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it hey  
  
I believe I can fly hoo  
I believe I can touch the sky  
I think about it every night and day  
Spread my wings and fly away  
I believe I can soar  
I see me running through that open door  
I believe I can fly (I can fly)  
I believe I can fly (I can fly)  
I believe I can fly (I can fly) hey  
  
If I just spread my wings (I can fly)  
I can fly (I can fly)  
I can fly (I can fly)  
I can fly, (I can fly) hey  
If I just spread my wings (I can fly)  
I can fly (I can fly)  
(I can fly)  
(I can fly)

[Chorus]  
I decided to stay home tonight  
I decided I'ma treat you right  
I decided to be there for you  
Decided to be on my P's and Q's  
I decided to give up my friends  
Decided I'ma take you out weekends  
Decided to give you a reason to trust  
These are decisions that I make for love  
  
Enough is enough no more running around  
(Searchin' for what's right here at home)  
Because my luck is 'bout to turn around  
(And I just can't keep doin' you wrong)  
Girl I take it for granted that you will be here always  
(Tired of this ego trip)  
'Cause soon you'll be searchin' for another man  
And I just can't have that happen to me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now I've had about all that I can stand no more  
(I'm turnin' in my playa's card)  
See I'm retirin' from the secret life I chose  
(Cause I just can't keep breakin' your heart)  
It was silly of me to be the way that I was  
(First was blind, but now I see)  
Baby, soon you'll be sayin' I'm fallin' out of love  
And I just can't let it happen whoa whoa I  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Bridge]  
When tha morning comes, you see the sun will shine on you and me  
Was on my way to losin' you, until' I found reality  
So cast away your doubts and fears, cause from now on I'll be right here  
For always  
Forever more, I decided  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Bridge]  
  
Girl I'm going to dump my friends  
Yes I will  
Truly I will  
We are going to be together on the weekend  
Whoa, whoa  
See these are the decisions I made for love  
For the two of us  
Get up off this bull and rebuild your trust  
Yeah, yeah, oh no, whoa  
There will be  
No more cheatin'  
No more creepin'  
No more fuckin'  
No more sneakin'

First of all you gotta understand  
This album is not about  
Me trying to show somebody I can do reggae music  
Or I'm reggae or anything like that  
This song is about is about reaching the masses  
You know what I sayin'?  
As a matter of fact  
The whole M-V-Project is really about  
It's not about R.Kelly shinin'  
It's about me shinin' the light  
On my people in Jamaica with my music  
Cause I got fans there and they love me  
You know what I mean?  
  
Don't like confrontation  
Don't like inconsideration  
Don't like false accusations  
Can't stand victimization  
Don't like starvation  
Oh I never liked discrimination  
It's not all about seperation  
It's about healing the nations  
  
[Repeat: x4]  
I like love  
I'm all about that thing called love  
Throw your hands up if you know about that thing called love  
  
I don't like aggravation  
Don't like humiliation  
And I can't stand defamation  
And I really don't like temptation  
Don't like exploitation  
I don't like decamation  
It's not about tribulations  
It's all about salvation  
  
[Repeat: x4]  
I like love  
I'm all about that thing called love  
Throw your hands up if you know about that thing called love  
  
It's all about love  
No matter where I go there's this one thing I know yeah  
It's all about love  
City to city when I'm up in the club yeah  
It's all about love  
Oh block to block all around the world holla  
It's all about love  
And if you feel me real people then put your hands up  
  
[Repeat: x4]  
I like love  
I'm all about that thing called love  
Throw your hands up if you know about that thing called love  
  
Yeah I hope y'all understand  
You know what I'm sayin' cause  
There's people out there that  
You know fans that will probably never get to see me  
I'll probably never get to see them  
But I want them to know that I love em  
I appreciate them for supportin' R. Kelly  
You know what I'm sayin'  
The different countries  
All different cultures  
The world  
Y'all made me who I am  
And I just wanna take this song to say thank you  
God bless you and your families  
Peace

As I lay me down  
Heaven hear me now  
I'm lost without a cause  
After giving it my all  
  
Winter storms have come  
And darkened my sun  
After all that I've been through  
Who on earth can I turn to  
  
I look to you  
I look to you  
  
After all my strength is gone  
In you I can be strong  
  
I look to you  
I look to you  
  
Yeah  
  
And when melodies are gone  
In you I hear a song  
  
I look to you, you  
  
About to lose my breathe,  
There's no more fighting left,  
I'm sinking to rise no more,  
Searching for that open door, door  
  
Every road that I've taken  
Lead to my regret.  
I don't know if I'm going to make it.  
Nothing to do but lift my head  
  
I look to you.  
I look to you.  
After all my strength is gone,  
In you I can be strong  
I look to you.  
I look to you.  
And when melodies are gone,  
In you I hear a song.  
I look to you (Whitney)  
We love you Whitney, rest in peace

This might sound strange, this might sound strange to you, to you  
I found someone that might just changed my life, yeah  
I know, cause she's always on my mind, every night  
  
I don't even know her Name  
I've never seen you up here before  
I love what she do  
I'm so into you  
Cause I love the D-J  
I love the D-J, she's so sexy  
I love the D-J  
I love the D-J, wow wow  
  
It turns me on when you spinning those records for me  
I wanna come right up there and grab hold of your body  
When ever you here, I know that you gonna play my favorite song tonight  
I can feel you working on my mind, you are so fine  
  
I don't even know her Name  
I've never seen you up here before  
I love what she do  
I'm so into you  
Cause I love the D-J  
I love the D-J, she's so sexy  
I love the D-J  
I love the D-J, wow wow  
  
Now you gonna slow down, slow it down, slow it down  
For all the lovers in the building yeah  
Slow it down, slow it down  
Girl we will be in the club forever  
  
Cause I love the D-J  
I love the D-J, she's so sexy  
I love the D-J  
I love the D-J wow wow

I wish, I wish, I wish  
To every city  
I wish, I wish, I wish  
Every hood  
I wish, I wish, I wish  
And every block  
Ghetto America!  
  
Rollin' through the hood  
Just stopped by to say what's up  
And let you know  
Your baby boy ain't doing so tough  
And even though you passed  
Going on four long years  
Still waking up late at night crying tears  
Just thinking about those days  
You used to talk to me  
Smilin' while I'm sippin' on this Hennessey  
And remember we bragged on how rich we would be  
To get up out this hood was like a fantasy  
  
And now you hear my songs the radio is bangin'  
Oh I can't believe my ears  
And what everybody's sayin'  
And boy I'll tell you, folks don't know the half  
I would give it all up, just to take one ride  
  
(With you)  
How I used to kick it on the front porch  
(With you)  
And how I used to lay back and smoke weed  
(With you)  
And all the little basement party joints we'd do  
Now I'm just missing you  
How I wish  
  
[Chorus]  
I wish that I could hold you now  
I wish that I could touch you now  
I wish that I could talk to you  
Be with you somehow  
I know you're in a better place  
Even though I can't see your face  
I know you're smiling down on me  
Saying everything's okay  
And if I make it out this thug life  
I'll see you again someday  
I wish, I wish, I wish  
I wish, I wish, I wish  
  
Now ever since this money come  
It's been nothing but stress  
Sometimes I wish that I could just trade in my success  
Y'all look at me and say boy you've been blessed  
But y'all don't see the inside of my unhappiness  
Man I swear this shit gets heavy like a ton  
That's why you hear me shootin', this real shit off like a gun  
Hmm I wonder how my friends would treat me now  
If I wasn't iced up with a Bentley and a house  
That's why fake ass niggas get fake ass digits  
And fake ass playas get a real playa hatin' 'em  
Honey Love goes platinum and y'all ass come around  
But y'all don't want to raise the roof  
Until my shit is going down  
  
And now you hear my songs the radio is bangin'  
Oh I can't believe my ears  
And what everybody's sayin'  
Boy I'll tell you, folks don't know the half  
I would give it all up, just to take one ride  
  
(With you)  
How I used to hoop off in them tournaments  
(With you)  
And how I used to club hop on weekends  
(With you)  
Your family called the morning of the tragic end  
Damn, my condolences  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Voices in my head be telling me to come to church  
Said the Lord is the only way for you to stop the hurt  
Dreaming of windows black tinted like a hearse  
When waking up to life sometimes seems worst  
And all I ever wanted is to be a better man  
And I try to keep it real with my homies now  
For me to save the world I don't understand  
How did I become the leader of a billion men?  
  
And now you hear my songs the radio is bangin'  
Oh I can't believe my ears  
And what everybody's sayin'  
Boy I'll tell you, folks don't know the half  
I would give it all up, just to take one ride  
  
(With you)  
How I used to street perform on Friday  
(With you)  
And how I used to go to church on Easter Sunday  
(With you)  
Standing here throwing them songs at me  
Somebody pray for me  
  
[Repeat: x3]  
I wish that I could hold you now  
I wish that I could touch you now  
I wish that I could talk to you  
Be with you somehow  
I know you're in a better place  
Even though I can't see your face  
I know you're smiling down on me  
Saying everything's okay

I mean everybody say "What if." What if I could fly? What if man could fly for
real? Wouldn't that be something? Man I  
Would surely touch the sky if I could just fly. [laughs] You know we have our
dreams, we always say what if, what if this,  
What if that. What if you and me were together? What if? Forever, I mean
eternity for real. What if?  
  
Ooh hoo if: yeah: Ooh: aww baby: yeah: listen

straight to heaven and Step with  
You while the angels sing. I'd ask you to marry me - give you the sun for a
diamond ring. If I could I'd do those things  
[1 x]  
  
Now If I were a preacher baby, my sermon would be about how God opened up
heaven and rained you on me (yeah)  
  
If I was a doctor baby I surely would give you something for your pain that'll
make you feel real good  
  
Now if I were a psychic baby then our love would last cause I'd go into the
future and prevent all break ups from coming  
To past - Lord  
  
If I were feeling down baby and really going through. All friends are gone
then I know that I can count on you.  
  
One more, If we were at a club baby and this jam came on, I'd grab you by the
hand and tell you let's Step to this song.

Hate and poverty for the more, lets me know  
That life is a stage and we're all in the show  
Starring the World, cause we all blow  
  
(Heaven I'm calling, heaven I'm calling)  
If we just give each other a chance  
(Heaven I'm calling, heaven I'm calling)  
We might just fall in love  
  
Picture us (in a land)  
Where there's no more (no more war)  
Shaking hands with my (brother)  
And respecting my my my (my sisters)  
(I'm offering) a dance that heals  
(A melody) you can feel  
Love is the key  
All it takes is you and me  
  
If I could make the world dance (whoa if I could make them dance)  
Then they would dance something like this  
If I could make the world groove (whoa if I could make them groove)  
Then they would groove something like this  
If I could make the world sing (whoa if I could make them sing)  
Then they would sing something like this  
If I could make the world love (if I could make them love, if I could make the
love one another)  
Then it would be something like this  
  
Tell me why can't more hungry people overcome  
When they've got the means to build bombs, yeah  
We're so quick to say God Bless America  
But take away In God We Trust  
Tell me what the hell is wrong with us  
  
(Heaven I'm calling, heaven I'm calling)  
If we just give each other a chance then  
(Heaven I'm calling, heaven I'm calling)  
We might just fall in love  
  
Picture us (in a land)  
Where there's no more (no more war)  
Shaking hands with my (brothers)  
And respecting my (sisters)  
I'm offering (I'm offering) a dance that heals  
(A melody) you can feel  
Love is the key  
All it takes is you and me

People, there's got to be  
A place that we can go  
And dance out the day  
So meet me at the  
Spot that we used to go  
And just step the night away  
Please let's just rewind time  
And go back because I miss those days  
  
If I could make the world dance (woah if I could make them dance)  
Then they would dance something like this  
If I could make the world groove (woah if I could make them groove)  
Then they would groove something like this  
If I could make the world sing (woah if I could make them sing)  
Then they would sing just like this (if I could make the world love)  
If I could make the world love (I surely would)  
Then it would be something like this  
  
If I could make the world (if I)  
If I could make the world (could make)  
If I could make the world (the world)  
If I could make the world (oh if I)  
If I could make the world (oh I)  
If I could make the world  
If I could make the world...  
  
Chocolate Factory  
If I could make the world dance  
I truly would  
Marvin Gaye inspired me to write that one ya'll  
Just as Frankie Beverley inspired me to write love street  
You know every day is a special occasion ya'll  
You know why? Cause you woke up this morning  
Happy People baby

How did I ever let you slip away  
Never knowing I'd be singing this song some day  
And now I'm sinking, sinking to rise no more  
Ever since you closed the door  
  
[Chorus]  
If I could turn, turn back the hands of time  
Then my darlin' you'd still be mine  
If I could turn, turn back the hands of time  
Then darlin' you, you'd still be mine  
  
Funny, funny how time goes by  
And blessings are missed in the wink of an eye  
Why oh why oh why should one have to go on suffering  
When every day I pray please come back to me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And you had enough love for the both of us  
But I, I, I did you wrong, I admit I did  
But now I'm facing the rest of my life alone, whoa  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'd never hurt you (If I could turn back)  
Never do you wrong (If I could turn back)  
And never leave your side (If I could turn back)  
If I could turn back the hands  
  
There'd be nothing I wouldn't do for you  
(If I could turn back)  
Forever honest and true to you  
(If I could turn back)  
If you accept me back in your heart, I love you  
(If I could turn back the hands)  
  
(If I could turn back)  
That would be my will  
(If I could turn back)  
Darlin' I'm begging you to take me by the hands  
(If I could turn back the hands)  
  
I'm going down, yes I am  
(If I could turn back)  
Down on my bended knee, yeah  
(If I could turn back)  
And I'm gonna be right there until you return to me  
(If I could turn back the hands)  
  
(If I could turn back)  
If I could just turn back that little clock on the wall  
(If I could turn back)  
Then I'd come to realize how much I love you  
Love you love you love you  
(If I could turn back the hands)

Shut up,  
I don't never want to hear you say that again  
Baby I'm not going nowhere  
Look at me, you understand me?  
  
Now, what gave you the silly idea that I'm about to leave  
Girl who you been listening to? They must be crazy  
Look back and see our past and all the shit that we been through  
I'll be damned if I'm gon let this bullcrap take me away from you  
Cause I vow to give my all and girl I'm a man of my words  
And on that word, I'll stand tall  
Being without you sounds absurd  
So dry your weeping eyes  
Cause I'll be here by your side  
No need to doubt the sky  
I'm in this for the long ride  
  
[Chorus]  
I will never leave, no  
You don't have to worry  
Girl I will be right there for you  
I will never leave, no  
Baby can't you see  
I was born to be with you  
I will never leave, no  
God put us together  
Nothing can take that away  
I will never leave you no  
Now until forever, be with you the rest of my days  
  
You never have to question the love I have for you  
Girl I will put my life on bended knees for you  
Ask all my friends, they'll tell you  
Your all I talk about  
Even when I go to sleep your the only one I dream about  
See I'm your picture girl and baby you are my frame  
And that's why I know our love will stay the same  
So dry your weeping eyes  
Girl I'm by your side  
Just trust me I'm that guy  
I'm in it for the long ride  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Since that the day the doctor took me out of the womb and spanked me  
Girl I was born to be with you and the rest is history  
Generations and now I'm all grown up and you carry my seed  
Now we are flesh and blood  
With you I am in love  
For the rest of my life  
For the rest of my life  
We've been blessed with a love that's rare  
That's why I'm not going nowhere  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I was meant to be with you  
  
[Chorus: Repeats]

[Celine]  
No mountain's too high for you to climb  
All you have to do is have some climbing faith, oh yeah  
No river's too wide for you to make it across  
All you have to do is believe it when you pray  
  
[R. Kelly]  
And then you will see the morning will come  
And every day will be bright as the sun  
All of your fears cast them on me  
I just want you to see  
  
[Both]  
[1] - I'll be your cloud up in the sky  
I'll be your shoulder when you cry  
I hear your voices when you call me  
I am your angel  
  
And when all hope is gone, I'm here  
No matter how far you are, I'm near  
It makes no difference who you are  
I am your angel  
I'm your angel  
  
[R. Kelly]  
I saw your teardrops and I heard you cry  
All you need is time  
Seek me and you shall find  
You have everything and you're still lonely  
It don't have to be this way  
Let me show you a better day  
  
[Celine]  
And then you will see the morning will come  
And all of your days will be bright as the sun  
So all of your fears just cast them on me  
How can I make you see?  
  
[Repeat 1]  
  
[R ] And when it's time to face the storm  
[Celine] I'll be right by your side  
[R ] Grace will keep us safe and warm  
[Celine] And I know we will survive  
And when it seems as if your end is drawing near  
[R ] (The end is drawing near)  
[Celine] Don't you dare give up the fight  
[R ] (Oh no)  
[Celine] Just put your trust beyond the skies  
  
[Repeat 1 until fade]

Close your eyes  
Now relax your mind  
Now I want you to picture yourself far far away  
(Prepare yourself girl cause we bout to take a ride)  
And I don't want you to have a care in the world right now  
It's just you and me  
In this moment? quiet  
Listen  
  
Baby take your mind into a zone  
Imagine that we all alone  
Two ways are off and our friends are gone  
Now it's just you and me getting it on  
Take my hand and come with me  
Let's indulge in fantasies  
Cast your cares and worries  
While we fall into this ecstasy  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm gonna rub your body, so baby just relax  
You've been pouring out your loving, so now its time to pour it back  
Imagine that  
Image that imagine that imagine that imagine that imagine imagine that  
Me stroking your body  
Image that imagine that imagine that imagine that imagine imagine that  
Whip cream and strawberries know what I mean  
Image that imagine that imagine that imagine that imagine imagine that  
Candles and oils surrounding the bed  
Image that imagine that imagine that imagine that imagine imagine that  
Me kissing your body from feet to head  
  
Imagine that  
We don't have to talk  
Lay your body here and watch my fingers walk  
Take a second and imagine the opportunity  
You and me sharing sexual energy  
Now girl just mediate on you being in this chair  
Then close your eyes and act like we not even here  
Girl  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah  
Baby  
Imagine  
Image that imagine that imagine that imagine that [Baby] imagine imagine that  
  
That I'm stroking your body  
Image that imagine that imagine that imagine that imagine imagine that  
Strawberries and whip cream imagine that  
Image that imagine that imagine that imagine that imagine imagine that  
Oh baby candles and oil surrounding the bed  
Image that imagine that imagine that imagine that imagine imagine that  
Imagine I'm taking off my clothes baby  
Hey  
Do it baby  
Take off all your clothes baby  
Imagine that  
Hey  
Cause you owe me baby  
And I want you baby  
So let it take control  
Hey  
Baby let it take control  
Oh  
Imagine that, I'm kissing you  
From feet to head  
Its your and me in the bed  
Screaming baby  
Say my name say my name say my name say my name say my name  
Oh

And he turned in some shine to rain  
Well boo I'm gonna ease your pain  
Because I'm gonna be your man  
  
[Chorus]  
It's all good  
See you've already been through enough baby  
It's all good  
That's why things are about to swing your way  
It's all good  
You see you don't have to worry baby  
It's all good  
'Cause tomorrow's sun is gonna bring a brighter day  
  
[R. Kelly]  
Yes we gon hit the shopping strip  
I'll buy you anything you want  
You deserve a first class trip  
Somewhere far away from home  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[R. Kelly]  
Free your mind  
And I'll lead you to place  
Where the wind blows  
And your cares I cast away  
And it's all good  
  
Come on, come on, yo  
Yo dippin' in the six with the top let down  
Smirk on my face cause I'm Rockland bound  
While on the other side of town  
  
I be holding it down  
Wearing brigets around on my platinum crown  
why'all want to see my business clothes  
See me fold  
  
Keep me from rocking the white gold  
Bitches hail,  
When I roll we'll sit on chrome  
When we do shows we sell out super domes  
  
While you at home burning the hot coal  
Honey left you coming home to me like it's a curfew  
One nice day and now she calling me boo  
And she calling you through  
  
And you calling me singing the sad tune  
I wish Kelly would pick up the celly  
Got a Philly in a telly with cramps in her belly  
Now I can get freaky with some K-why-jelly  
  
But I'd rather go cruise with my man  
What the deally?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[R. Kelly]  
It's all good  
See I just want to see you happy darling  
It's all good  
Yeah, and I can't stand to see your eyes crying  
It's all good  
And if it takes the rest of all my life  
It's all good  
Your whole world's gonna be a paradise  
It's all good  
  
Rockland, Trackmasters  
Nine-Eight  
You suckers, screw all of why'all

[Chorus]  
I've been kicking it with your girlfriend  
Oh what am I gonna do?  
Cause God knows that I really didn't mean to hurt you  
I know it's bogus, but I felt that you should know the truth  
I fell in love with her the moment that we were introduced  
And I just feel that it's time for this little secret to end  
Baby, I've been kicking it with your girlfriend  
  
Go ahead and slap me again, cause I can understand how you feel  
When a man takes you for granted and he don't keep it real  
I should've been a man and told you a long time ago  
Instead of stunning I should have broke it down and let you know  
Girl my fault for that, don't know what's on my mind  
And I blame myself for wasting your time  
Believe, I really did try to keep that girl away from me  
But her body language kept on temping and teasing me  
And plus she knew what she was doing when she did it anyway  
I knew what she was doing too and that made it okay  
Truth is that we don't even regret it  
Up out the closet I will be the first to say it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now I apologize for me and her and everything that went down  
These are the reasons why some girls don't bring they friends around  
I just didn't know how to tell you that I was feelin her  
And how we get away sometimes and make love  
I never wanted to dislead you  
At first I just wanted to please you  
I know it's hard for you to be able to trust again  
Because I came between you and your best friend  
I did not ask for this  
It just happened outta no where since the day we kissed  
And the truth is that we don't even regret it  
Up out the closet, I will be the first to say it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Bridge]  
I'm sorry again  
Never meant to hurt you  
I'm sorry again  
But girl I love her  
I'm sorry again  
I never meant to make you cry, no  
The first one out the closet  
  
[Chorus: x2]

Uh, yeah, uh huh, uh  
Go ladies, go ladies  
Go ladies, go ladies  
Go ladies, go ladies  
Go ladies, go ladies  
Uh, whoo!  
  
She's like the sun shining bright  
A romantic moonlight  
Like white clouds and blue skies  
She's got diamonds in her eyes  
My rainbow after the rain  
She's my joy after the pain  
Far away paradise  
Make you wanna touch the sky  
Like the highest mountain peak  
As the ocean goes deep...  
  
I wanna dance with that woman, yeah  
Dance with that woman, yeah  
I wanna dance with that woman, yeah

Oh yeah  
  
She's like the greatest waterfalls  
On Christmas she's Miss Santa Claus  
Just like Grandma's apple pie  
Girl you're all the reasons why  
She's a comforter and friend  
I tell you she's that peace within  
She's the lover in my home  
She's the strength when I'm not strong  
Every day my valentine  
I'm so glad heaven made her mine...  
  
I wanna dance with that woman, yeah  
Dance with that woman, yeah  
I wanna dance with that woman, yeah

Ft. Taj Jackson  
  
Baby don't speak  
Let your body tell me  
Everything that you want and you need  
It's the language of love  
Let your heart beat  
Tell me everything  
That you want and you need  
Cause it's the language  
The language of love  
Language of love  
  
Your expressions are saying what I wanna hear  
Like baby will you spend the night  
Let's go to the special place you always take me to  
The signal I'm whispering inside your ear  
Got you feeling butterflies  
Cause you're anticipating the things I'ma do to you  
  
She's swinging her hair  
That's sign number one  
Doing the dance for me  
Like I'm that song in the club  
And she's putting her hair  
Where she wants me to start from  
Only what I wanna hear you say  
  
Baby don't speak  
Let your body tell me  
Everything that you want and you need  
It's the language of love  
Let your heart beat  
Tell me everything  
That you want and you need  
Cause it's the language  
The language of love  
Language of love  
The language of love  
Softly, you're killing me the pillow  
She's finding me funny  
But shaking like it's 30 degrees below  
So I gotta keep her warm  
Like some hot tea  
Keep you up all night  
Like some coffee  
Take you on a ride  
We'll be sitting in the backseat  
On my Bentley  
Take you anywhere you wanna go  
  
She's breathing hard  
That's sign number two  
Doesn't matter where we are  
Long as I'm with you  
But the way you communicate  
When I do what you like  
Only what I wanna hear you say  
  
Baby don't speak  
Let your body tell me  
Everything that you want and you need  
It's the language of love  
Let your heart beat  
Tell me everything  
That you want and you need  
Cause it's the language  
The language of love  
Language of love  
The language of love

You have reached R.Kelly  
Unfortunately, I'm sleep  
Been out partying all night  
And I'm blasted off that Hennessey  
I hop to hotel lobbies  
Going to them after parties  
Throwing up and carrying on  
'Bout to have somebody drive me home  
I get through the door  
Fall on the floor  
Get up  
I'm staggering

Drinking Belvedere, 7-Up, and gin  
I told myself never again  
Sleeping while the club is crunk  
Don't make no sense to be that drunk  
Arguing through the night  
Pushing on people and starting fights  
I was fucked up  
I confess  
People saying Kellz is a hot mess  
Even after that I was taking shots  
Shot after shot  
Shot after shot then  
I couldn't even open the door to my Benz  
Dropped off and I get in the door now  
Lying on the stairs snoring now

Damn, 200 missed calls

You know nothin's gettin' done when talk is all you hear  
Like someone revvin' up a truck never put in gear  
But you don't see a cowboy run his mouth and strut around  
He just takes the bull by the horns and throws him to the ground  
Takin' care of business not just puttin' on a show  
When it gets down to it, everybody knows  
  
It ain't the smoke, it's the fire that gets the burnin' done  
If it wasn't for the bullet, nobody'd fear the gun  
It ain't the bark, it ain't the growl, it's the bite that hurts  
Thunder's just a noise, boys, lightnin' does the work  
  
You can talk about the farm or you can plow the ground  
Argue with a rusty nail or hammer it on down  
You can stand there in the dark cussin' at the night  
Or you can just reach out your hand and turn on the light  
There ain't no limit in this life to how far you can get  
But if you're goin' all the way you gotta break a sweat  
  
It ain't the smoke, it's the fire that gets the burnin' done  
If it wasn't for the bullet, nobody'd fear the gun  
It ain't the bark, it ain't the growl, it's the bite that hurts  
Thunder's just a noise, boys, lightnin' does the work  
  
I've heard thunder talkin' up a storm  
Rattlin' my windows and knockin' on my door  
But I've seen lightnin' blow a cypress tree in half  
The thunder's busy talkin', and lightnin's kickin'  
  
It ain't the smoke, it's the fire that gets the burnin' done  
If it wasn't for the bullet, nobody'd fear the gun  
It ain't the bark, it ain't the growl, it's the bite that hurts  
Thunder's just a noise, boys, lightnin' does the work  
Thunder's just a noise, boys, lightnin' does the work  
  
Ahh yeah  
Gonna getcha  
Getcha good

Out of all the girls I've loved before  
Out of all the stages I've performed on  
Out of all of the cities I've been to  
I bless the day that I found you  
  
I bless the day I found you and that's my word  
It's nothing for me out there in those streets  
You took my heart and you set it on fire  
And now my love forever burns  
You keep taking me higher  
  
[Chorus]  
I been looking for love  
In all the wrong places  
And now I finally found  
Someone who cares for me  
No matter the storm  
It was you who helped me face it  
And now it's safe to say  
That you really care for me  
  
Just like the wings  
You took me, flew me away, yeah  
And now my ground is underneath my feet  
This man had nowhere to go  
Then you gave me direction  
And now the rest of my days  
I can't help but give you the praise  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You saw my needs, forgave my faults  
You cleansed my heart, you changed my thoughts  
You brought the sun into my life  
When my world had seemed dark, yes you did  
And you're the only one  
Who was there when I needed a friend  
You're the only one who can place joy  
When there's pain in my heart  
  
[Chorus]

I wanna bring love, back to the radio,  
Can I bring love songs, back to the radio?  
I wanna be blind, tonight, while I'm loving you,  
I wanna have to find my way,  
And I don't wanna have a clue.  
Just let the universe surprise me,  
When I walk into your room, babe  
I got a whole lot of kissing and a whole lot of touching  
And a whole lot of loving waiting on you, babe.  
Got a whole lot of feeling, and a whole lot of thrilling,  
And a whole lot of healing, wanna please you.  
So, let's turn off all the lights because:  
  
[Chorus]  
Babe tonight, I wanna be lost in your love,  
Babe tonight I wanna get lost in your love,  
Girl, tonight!  
Babe tonight I wanna get lost in your love,  
Babe tonight I wanna get lost in your love!  
I wanna get lost babe!  
I wanna get lost babe!  
I wanna get lost babe!  
I wanna get lost babe!  
  
I wanna make love in  
I love feeling on you, yeah, babe!  
And I don't wanna have to care,  
You just do what you wanna do  
To me, babe!  
I wanna drift far out in your, girl,  
  
And get trapped in your wilderness.  
I got a whole lot of kissing and a whole lot of touching  
And a whole lot of loving waiting on you, yes babe!  
Got a whole lot of feeling, and a whole lot of thrilling,  
And a whole lot of healing, wanna please you.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We don't need no explanation  
Cause this love will make our confirmation,  
So let it do, let it do,  
Girl, let us lose ourselves in this magic  
Now babe tonight!  
  
[Chorus]

Oooh yeah, aaah baby

Might as well call me a telegram baby,  
'Cause darling that's just how you send me, yeah  
I'm might as well take me a pen and sign a wave,  
To be yours for the rest of my life,  
You rescued me from heartache just like a savior,  
Now being in your arms is like my paradise,  
  
Listen baby,  
Ain't no love like your love, ain't no kiss like your kiss,  
Felt a whole lot of things but nothing's ever felt like this,

But we've got the victory darling and proved them all wrong,  
Just like the sun comes in, chased away the rain,  
See I love you boy, you take away my pain,

'Cause I'll run a million miles to get you baby,
