What about your friends  
What about  
What about your friends  
What about what about  
  
Every now and then I get a little crazy  
That's not the way it's supposed to be  
Sometimes my vision is a little hazy  
I can't tell who I should trust or just who I let trust me (yeah)  
  
People try to say I act a little funny  
But that's just a figure of speech to me  
They tell me I changed because I got money  
But if you were there before then you're still down with me  
  
[Chorus:]  
What about your friends will they stand their ground  
Will they let you down again  
What about your friends are they gonna be low down  
Will they ever be around or will they turn their backs on you  
  
Well is it me or can it be I'm a little too  
Friendly so to speak hypothetically  
Say I supply creativity to what others  
Must take as a form of self-hate  
Only to make an enemy  
Which results in unfortunate destiny  
They dog me out then be next to me  
Just cause I am what some choose to envy  
  
Every now and then I get a little easy  
I let a lot of people depend on me  
I never though they would ever deceive me  
Don't you know when times got rough I was standing on my own  
I'll never let another get that close to me  
You see I've grown a lot smarter now  
Sometimes you have to choose and then you'll see  
If your friend is true they'll be there with you  
Through the thick and thin  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Friends...  
Let you down again....  
Be low down...  
  
Forget giggly boogly  
I'm attack it like a seizure  
I got rhymes at my leisure  
Time when I need ta  
With T to the L to the C  
What I be sayin'  
Gettin' loose on this track  
But underground is where I'm stayin'  
So hip hip hooray organizers comin' in  
On a friend like the oj  
But what about your friends to the end  
Will they run on out like a jeeble  
Or you'll find 'em stickin' close to your side  
Like a big bunch of fiends  
Six now the groupies drinkin' water  
I get real funny so you'd better hide your daughter  
Oh buddy oh pal oh chump friend of mine  
Stayin' close like ketchup  
A virgin that's right you call me Bruce Lee right  
For the styles that me kick  
And give me enough respect for this funky remix  
One one thousand two one thousand three one thousand blitz  
Now the rabbit felt blue so I gave the nigga Trix  
Cuz I was his friend wasn't down for the beggin'  
You called me a friend we're seven about to takin'  
Take a tickin' keep on lickin' why you dippin' for the border  
You said you'd be down for richer for poorer but  
O-you-T-K-A-S-T ain't no change so tlc go head and sang baby  
  
Yo is it me  
L to the E-F-T-E-Y-E (a ha ha)  
Or can it be I am a little too  
Friendly so to speak hypothetically  
Say I supply creativity to what others  
Must take as a form of self-hate  
Only to make an enemy  
Which results in unfortunate destiny  
They dog me out then be next to me  
Just cause I am what some choose to envy  
  
Brrrrr..... Ba ba ba  
Back up  
This ya wicked remix  
Come down wicked sing  
Rewind with em aya  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
People say I act a little funny  
I wouldn't change not for no money  
I'll be a friend as long as you're a friend to me (yeah, yeah)  
Even though I might seem easy  
It don't give you no cause to deceive me...

As I sit in my b-boy stance  
With flip-flops and socks, and sweatpants  
We finna enhance your brain, check it out  
Once upon a time not long ago  
When the player from the Pointe didn't have no flow  
A nigga hit me for my tennis shoes, walking to the sto'  
Caught a nigga slipping, but now I lay it to the flo'  
Just like carbon, cause I got the heat in my rhythm  
Momma nay not, never bragging just to stay knot  
Even when I was a younger lad I learned my lesson  
Never talked to strangers in the trap and answered questions  
The Pope and his folks got us under a scope  
But for unknown reasons cause we don't sell dope  
That you distribute, we don't contribute, to your clandestine  
Activity, my soliloquy, may be hard for some to swallow  
But so is cod liver oil  
You went behind my back like Bluto when he cut up Olive Oyl  
Two things I hate lies and thieves they make my blood boil  
Boa constricted, on my soul that they call  
  
[Chorus]  
Touched by the wheelz of steel  
Now show me how you feel  
Touched by the wheelz of steel  
Now show me how you feel  
  
It took your momma nine months to make it  
But it only took a nigga thirty minutes to take it  
Cut that kronk clean up I did, but I did so not safely  
Don't want no AIDS, no claps, or no rabies  
Yo, we take no shit, like, stopped up commodes  
Gotta collect call, they done locked up my folks  
Low blow, hit me in the left ventricle  
We won't be able to ride out till two thousand fo'  
But not for long cause we got a better sack to serve  
Trying to take you other people for your rims at the curb  
Fore you swerve and bust ya forehead, go head, go head  
More head for me, while you ride to the beat  
Drop, like Tears, like For Fears, you know  
Shout Shout let it all out, just for my peers  
And pupils who feel like it's time to unwind  
Like December 31st, on nineteen-ninety-nine  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Okay, like this, yeah yeah  
One time for my boy doing King shit  
Two times for Legit and it don't quit  
Three times for my folks in the drop top  
Four times OutKast and it don't stop  
One time for my cause doing Queen things  
Dead fresh to the teeth eating chicken wings  
Three times for my guhls in the beauty shop  
Four times OutKast and it don't stop  
  
[Chorus]

Hey,  
Uh-huh,  
Well, alright  
  
How y'all doing? Yes Ma'am!  
Lookin' mighty fine.  
  
I've been around the world,  
Seen so many pretty girls.  
But I still get overwhelmed,  
When I look in your eyes.  
  
Been from Maine to Spain,  
But everything seems the same,  
I only feel a change,  
When I look in your eyes.  
  
I know you're upper class,  
I know you've got pizzas.  
Every man wanna kiss yo'  
And I do, too!  
  
Sometimes, I'm just a clown,  
And everybody puts me down.  
I guess I'll come around,  
When I look in your eyes.  
  
Tell me, what's a man to do,  
To get close to you.  
I'm just a lonely fool,  
When I look in your eyes.  
  
Don't tell me "no" this time,  
If you do, it'll blow my mind.  
Have you ever seen a grown man cry?  
It's an awful thing.  
  
I guess it's time to say goodbye,  
But I've gotta give it one more try.  
I'm only satisfied,  
When I look in your eyes.  
  
Oh please come home with me,  
Oh don't you wanna marry me?  
I'm even goin' rub your feet when they stank (how can i)  
How can I let you down,  
I guess I'm always goin' be around.  
I'm simply astounded,  
When I look in your eyes.

Hello lord, it's me again, I just wanna make to love the whole globe  
And all her girlfriends now don't that make ya mind move  
Like smoke patterns, me on my way to Saturn wit a bomb  
Numb be it view, or Saudi Shawty  
I figure before the first gun blast, they know who gone win  
Now won't that make us all fools  
Like class clowns praying Private Ryan comes round  
Sound travels at one thousand, one thirty, feet per second  
Niggaz in the street they want it hurry  
When niggaz start biting that's when 3000 starts to worry  
A little knowledge from the college of wizard Ray Murray  
Answer quick do you know what desire is? "Huh?"  
Apparently not that's why you get what you got  
Now answer this do you know what fire is? "Yeah"  
The body of hot, the motivator of pots  
Snot, spit, shit are characteristics of release  
Ask your niece or nephew, you think we left you  
What the future holds in its sweaty palms  
Thank I'm finna vom? Ya move like ya mean it she'll cum  
Prom night might excite a down right fight like  
White blood cell to the common cold rebel  
Night gets jealous of day play is no longer  
The feelin gets stronger than Ammonia sticks inhale  
  
We just can't be amazed  
Even if you pull the pin from your hand grenade  
We just can't be amazed  
Even if you pull the pin from your hand grenade  
We just can't be amazed  
Even if you pull the pin from your hand grenade  
And we some home-made bombs  
Finna blow right up in your face  
  
Look at the way you look at me I see it on your face  
All your hate emanates but you still hesitate  
Cause you want inside of my head but don't know how  
To brainwash me to be a commercial clown  
Fuck that I see the way you were,  
see the way you smirk I'm catching you where you work  
God only knows all the trouble that grows  
Deep beneath my soul dealing with you assholes  
Can I blast those who point the finger at me  
Who criticize and talk shit so freely  
Fuck XXL you're a size too small  
I should hire Eminem so we can kill you all  
Whether you live to talk shit about the Real  
Then kiss my ass in person how much you love the Hill  
I'm the outcast comin to blaze the grass  
Outlaw due to my life that's come to pass  
Dre, pass me the glass of wine  
So I can pour it over my homies grave and mine  
For all those who fallen and answered when God was calling  
Jump into my ragtop and get all in  
I'm the bomb, planted in your car why you frozen  
Pop the tape in ignite the xplosion  
The world is mine, the world is yours, the world is ours  
The world is lost, the world is tossed  
  
We just can't be amazed  
Even if you pull the pin from your hand grenade  
And we some home-made bombs  
Finna blow right up in your face  
  
With a one-two punch, B-Real and Andre dropped they verses  
Your homeboy Daddy Fat Sax playin clean-up so it worsens  
People and persons on the opposite teams oh, yes its curtains  
No bullets burpin' oh just lyrically twerking  
Making a statement, when you freestyle  
and your mind is in a free state  
Is kinda hard to execute when you ain't feeling it that day  
Jumpin the gun and rushing your flow  
Babbling on the mikie like auctioneer, got the public's ears  
Fucked up can't hear, Atlanta, Georgia where y'all at?  
OutKast this Dirty South to death the Dungeon Family Camp  
Got this thang lit like stamps and nine-volt battery end caps  
Making that music that make your neck hurt  
And the beats that bother your back in my Cadillac  
Six woofers and four amps, lo pro vogues on swole  
With the carriage lamps diamond tucked velour pistol in my lap  
Come in peace but then xplode like booty traps
