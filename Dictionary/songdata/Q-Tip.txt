Dove:

Hello it's the soul  
Troopin' in wit the Jungle patrol  
And this one's about the ko's the knockouts out there  
Who's holdin' my buddy  
Hold up  
(wait a minute)  
  
Pos:  
Now just wait  
We're gonna talk about Buddy on this plate  
But before we let the herd out the gate  
Make sure the all the levels are straight out the jungle  
(The Jungle, the Jungle, the Brothers, the Brothers)  
  
Afrika:  
De La Soul from the soul  
Black medallions no gold  
Hangin' out wit Pos hangin' out wit Mase  
Buddy buddy buddy all in my face  
  
Mike G:  
For the lap Jimbrowski must wear a cap  
Just in case the young girl likes to clap  
Ain't for the wind but before I begin  
I initiate the buddy with a slap  
  
Q-Tip:  
Now for the next  
I'm the Q-Tip from A Tribe Called Quest  
And when I quest for the buddy I don't fess  
For my jimmy wants nothin' but the best (the best)  
The best (Ooh Wee!)  
Let's stick out jimmy and see what we can catch  
(Stick em up, stick em up jimmy)  
Next won't be needed unless  
(Jenny wanna get right to the flesh)  
  
(Sweet little woman, sweet little woman)  
  
Pos:  
I won't lie, I love B-you-D-D-Y (why)  
Cause I never let it walk on by  
When it comes to me and Jenny I seem (very serious)  
Like a Peak Freen  
Buddy is the act that occurs on the lip  
When Jenny and jimmy start shootin' the gift  
Boy let me get shot I won't even riff  
  
Afrika:  
Buddy buddy don't you know you make me go nutty  
I'm so glad that you're not a fuddy duddy  
Not too skinny and not too chubby  
Soft like silly putty  
Miss Crabtree I hope that you're not mad at me  
Cause I told you that it was your buddy  
That was making me ever so horny  
Junglelistically horny  
  
Dove:  
On the dial my buddy talks to me for a while  
Plug Two is the  
  
Q-Tip:  
Q to her tip  
  
Dove:  
On the A side and sometimes the flip  
(Gotta gotta flip this record)  
Buddy is the bud to my daisy tree  
And the luuden to my do-re-mi  
And the pleaser to my man Plug 3  
(Plug 3 gets all the buddy)  
  
Mike G:  
Behind my bush my buddy likes the way that I push  
And like a champ just knock it on out  
Never ever once sellin' out  
(Oh let loose the juice)  
My buddy helps me to  
(De La my Soul)  
Keepin' jimmy in total control  
Without Buddy I'd be on a roll  
  
(La la la l-la la la la, la la la l-la la la la)  
  
Q-Tip:  
Hey girl I heard ya lookin' for some good times  
If you Quest from the Soul here's what we'll find  
A whole lot of fun lots of fun together  
Just like kissin' cousins (yeah that's kinda clever)  
Close like bosoms, bosoms stay close  
If you be my buddy I will toast  
That we're like Ethel Merts and Lucille Macgillicuddy  
You can be mines and I can be your buddy  
  
Dove:  
The best buddy's in evening wear  
Long lovin' less Tru know (he's in there)  
I feel sorry for those who pay a fare (a fee) word to the D  
I don't beg I just tease my buddy with my right leg  
And when it's ready what's said is buddy is best in bed  
  
Afrika:  
Fly buddy told us all to get into a circle  
Said don't worry cause I won't hurt you  
All I really wanna do is freak you (she freaked us)  
  
Mike G:  
And I watched and then I checked my swatch  
To see the time  
The Soul had formed a buddy line  
And that buddy was (mine all mine)  
  
Pos:  
Now when Tribe, the Jungle, and De La Soul  
Is at the clubs our ritual unfolds  
Grab our bones and start swingin' our hands  
(Then Jenny start flockin' it everywhere)  
Cause Jenifa just wants to stay aware  
Yo fellas should we keep her aware  
(Mmm Hmm, yeah!!!)

Take you (higher)  
Hit you (higher)  
Make you (higher)  
Hit you (higher)  
Take you (higher)

Funny brothers on my nerves type ridiculous  
I guess I really gotta do it  
Put my game down  
Hold the game you fucking blew it  
Put my name down  
And it seems you fucked up like a drug deal gone wrong  
Figured out a lot, you won't be that way long  
Plus, you niggas is bush leaguers  
And I bet y'all ain't get no bush either  
My hood dogs sing songs of rejection and pain  
If we get sunshine, it's followed up by rain  
Like to lay your jig down and get a blessing of brains  
My man Skeet so he stressing your chain  
We see the 'morrow through the shades of it might not come  
Got to get it all now 'cause we might be done  
Matrix, nigga (nigga) you looking at the one  
Fortified with a bonafide blastin' of a gun  
We in the space for positionin'  
Money and illiciting  
Living out our lives while certain cats just lookin' in  
We bewildered off the sacks and the green  
Whether the bay, L.A., or Chicago or Queens  
You better raise your game  
They comin' at you high  
You better raise your game  
Don't ask no questions why, nigga  
Then speak figuratively, I mean this shit  
And speak literally, you in some shit

I dominate flows  
I dominate shows  
And, in the night time our dominance grows  
And, you could see from the posture I'm holding  
Yo, I'm re-ing up while the rest is folding  
A hip hop cat who's flown world wide and  
Experience, adventures like Poseidon  
Bunk heads with r and b chicks  
Give 'em one hit joints and they lookin' for the remix  
The shit that I spit like plain clothes days  
Surprised you legit make your whole team freeze  
I'm so irregular  
Ear on the cellular  
Let's celebrate 'cause your man is a hell of a  
Fillin' the blank with a good thing to fill in  
We hold it still 'cause we walkin' with still (chance)  
Blindsided up in your own reality  
While we in the heat of the moment, fuck morality  
I really wanna see you rise to my joint ma (ma)  
I'm lookin' straight don't see your eyes get my point ma (ma)  
However you do it, I'm doing you back  
Yo, don't misconstrue it, 'cause I'm screwing it back  
Yo, rappers better count my presence as they down time  
I gotta move around, don't have no fuck around time  
So, you better just get on back  
Just (incoherent scats) abst'act  
  
Hey yo, (higher) take you

Uh, uh, higher, we gettin' higher

Yo, one more time  
I don't know what to make of this  
Funny brothers on my nerves type ridiculous  
I guess I really gotta do it  
Put my game down  
Hold the game you fuckin' blew it  
Put my name down  
And it seems you fucked up like a drug deal gone wrong  
Makin' out a lot, you won't be that way long  
Yeah yeah, plus, y'all niggas is bush leaguers  
And I bet y'all ain't gettin' no bush either  
And I bet y'all ain't gettin' no a-hoop either

Life is filled with gray  
But now he comes to me  
Please fall away  
Hip hop is playing again  
And it's bangin' too  
Gonna bang for you  
Don't stop this feeling I feel  
I just wanna run out all day for you  
And breathe for you at least  
I'm so into your rich history  
Tell me a story and take me away  
C'mon and take me ooh  
C'mon and take me with you

One step at a time, a man walked on the moon  
One record got played Kool Herc said boom  
One minute young man, your time come soon  
We waiting, it was prophesied you loom  
We bang our drums, message in our sound  
We rastlers and we takin' up in your town  
Hands set in  
It's perfected on this vibe I'm gettin' play list settin'  
Cold Crush, Furious Five, and a Master God  
Cosmic Force Bammbaataa and every part of

For real though who really got sent  
Flown on the edge, got the ledge hangin' out of the window  
Bird chest witcha winderous fearaf?  
Around you'll be hemps meat inside of a meal sack  
Puny little bucks better hit the jake  
But that doesn't mean nothin' to the heart within  
You cramped up you and your team, I'm amped up  
And you can't dib me bead  
  
My shine, what the is on your mind?  
Little weakling rappers better hit the grind  
Other brothers ain't motivated, they can't do it  
Not only did I penetrate it I ran through it  
My music comes on and we march at the dance  
Inside of your mind or inside of my pants?  
Musical intention that we have is vast  
You sick, drink a Nyquil, well, I'm dead on your  
  
Oh well, then here comes the gelatin  
Tips on some sugars but you yap on your sellin' friends  
Now your party is completely blown  
Real name is Kamal, I'm in completely zone  
It's rap time for you, that means nap time  
Preachin' from my joint, what the I'ma clap mine  
Singin songs of 6 pence it's intense  
Surpise your at the end like the sixth sense  
  
Heavy hitters knockin' shit out the park  
You couldn't even really play tell me why did you start  
Spittin' sharp blades laced with bleach  
You wanna play around kid, I'm not a walk at the beach  
A stroll in the park or your playground  
Put on your headphones, tell me how grenades sound  
Put on your walkmase and go underneath the town  
Q-Tip abstract how I gets down  
  
All my bitches, dance if you know that you dam sure  
Let your drip on the dance floor if you wanna  
Get down  
That, that bust gats  
Better let 'em in 'fore they rush that 'cuz they wanna  
Get down  
  
Blick, piano sick  
Get down  
Chill you can get off my and  
Get down  
While I'm on the hook get on your good foot  
And blow up the spot for all of you 'cuz that's how we  
Get down  
  
Comin' with the brand new quickly we pan to  
The young black man with intentions to ban you  
Seems that people need an aid today  
So many fade away, so many fiend to stay  
I really rhyme 'cuz I feel I should say things  
While the fraudulent act raps just so they cop rings  
Or maybe because when they was young  
They was fronted on and left alone to have they own fun  
Now they've all grown up to be  
I'm giving you the rope will you tie up the lassos  
  
You swing dangling from peach trees  
While I sip my Daqaris in the south west breeze  
Writing so exciting the pen it keeps  
Drippin' out gems that's converted to hems and then  
People be hummin' it from now to they next to kin  
My family is starvin', you know they want me to win  
Me forfeit, please get off it  
Send a check in my name to my office  
Mutombo in the lane, yo I toss it  
Abstract comin' through witness the bull  
  
Hey yo, hey yo engineer cut the beat off

Lets talk about these things we see  
Walking across the land  
Lets talk about these joints I got  
Every body get down  
Lets talk about these things we see  
Lets talk about these joints I got  
  
[Chorus]  
Lets talk about the rules I bring  
And the things we take  
And the jobs we hold  
And the land we stole  
And a buck or two  
And the love for you  
And the things you do [Repeat: x5]  
  
I puff L's with ladies and gentlemen  
I break spells with faith in a burst of wind  
Others talk but.what they talk about?  
Who could walk but live what they walkabout  
A calm head in the middle of wartime  
People go down just so they could get more shine  
Girls wave your flag and surrender your faculty  
Niggas got geez but its not really mack to me  
Keep it soft like we killers and often gat  
You walking on me guaranteed you be crawling back  
Abstract see it like this is the king in you  
Allies living one more if I'm fucking too  
Dogs don't eat it up increase they feeding time  
I'll be damned if a mutt starts eating mine  
Let's stay clubbed out the moon makes it whistle  
Pants gripped your ass now I hope they don't fall apart  
Look around you tell me who else is shining girl  
Fat rapping cats on my dick they just whining girl  
That's just the magnetism that a Queens fella has  
Range rover gism and he fronting with his Lexus ass  
But watch I'ma drop to a bronco  
See me in your Bentley nigga just honk yo!  
And just know that your man to can get that  
And just though that I don't really wet that  
And just know that this nigga here flips tracks  
Ooh what, whose ya, pain and slip that  
The illest regiment is what I represent  
Get us mad you gonna see the way gorillas went  
Mactime I need a diamond at least a friend  
I fear Allah he has no start and he has no end  
We raise the roof up and tear the fuck up off  
Bucking hard like the coast guard, who's soft?  
  
[Chorus: x3]

And it, and it begins, he walks outside for a cigarette break  
And thinks how many cigarettes does it take  
He takes a long drag with the sun in his eye  
He squints, he thinks he starts to sigh  
Sometimes he cry  
When he think about his girlfriend on his side  
She held him down, she made him better  
Fought the love, through the fucked up weather  
And she thinkin about her life  
With no more work just being a wife  
But instead her love, she gave it to a man  
Who fought against her lovely plans  
So when she go to work, plus go to school  
Plus fight the love, she must feel like a fool  
She want the ease that come after pain  
She fights for love, thats her campaign  
We fight, we love  
  
We fight and love so much  
Sometimes I get confused of who we are  
Maybe if we just stop and chat and  
It will find out who we are  
We fight and love so much  
Sometimes I get confused of who we are  
Maybe if we just stop and chat and  
It will find out who we are  
  
(Fight) just a little bit  
(Love) just a little bit  
(Fight) just a little bit  
(Love) just a little bit more  
  
We just keep on  
  
(Fight) just a little bit  
(Love) just a little bit  
(Fight) just a little bit  
(Love) just a little bit more  
(Fight) just a little bit  
(Love) just a little bit  
(Fight) just a little bit  
(Love) just a little bit more  
  
And it, and it begins, he's off the ball  
He left his friends, he ain't home no more  
He's in a place, that's far away  
Where he can't understand what they say  
They say salaam, they cary bombs  
In crouded places, and cause alarm  
You're the infidel who's uninvited  
But really an American boy who's slighted  
It ain't your fault, you want identity  
So you join this big fraternity  
You get to travel the world, its cheaper than college  
And you get guns and you get knowledge  
Lookin for your soul, and WMD's  
You can't find nothing, cause its empty  
You got your gun, and he's your friend  
And he's your man, until the end  
We fight, we love  
  
We fight and love so much sometimes  
I get confused of who we are  
Maybe if we just stop and chat and  
It will find out who we are  
We fight and love so much sometimes  
I get confused of who we are  
Maybe if we just stop and chat and  
It will find out who we are  
  
(Fight) just a little bit  
(Love) just a little bit  
(Fight) just a little bit  
(Love) just a little bit more  
  
We just keep on  
  
(Fight) just a little bit  
(Love) just a little bit  
(Fight) just a little bit  
(Love) just a little bit more  
(Fight) just a little bit  
(Love) just a little bit  
(Fight) just a little bit  
(Love) just a little bit more  
(Fight) just a little bit  
(Love) just a little bit  
(Fight) just a little bit  
(Love) just a little bit more  
(Fight) just a little bit  
(Love) just a little bit  
(Fight) just a little bit  
(Love) just a little bit more

Shocka called me up to do this thing for Soundbombing  
And I figured that I'd do it cause it wasn't no harmin'  
Shine a little bit in case somebody was forgettin'  
About that Queens motherfucker, y'all need to take cover  
I'ma take position and y'all best to take sha-hida  
'Cause the shit that I spit is hot as hellfire, hotter  
Sendin' this to Cross, Meniski, and Bay Vigi  
Doug, Pretty Tone and the one that shoot the vidi  
Y'all stay in my heart, while I dabble with the charts  
Fuck the fame and my aim find the clarity in art  
This cowards got it once cause he kept his lips zippin'  
Now he in the news and he wettin' and I'm livin'  
This Southern cowards life who I used to do my clues with  
Subliminally this is me, I try not to assume shit  
Let's not forget the king of Internet  
Will assume another name while he tarnishes ya rep  
And calls you Ziggy Starters but who the major charm  
Who starts to elevate out the reach of his arm  
  
It's a great day fuck it  
Ya probably hear the bundles overflowin' out of Ruckers  
The name is Abstract don't confuse without description  
'Cause you lil' gremlins envy so just cut the fuckin' weak shit  
Ride off in the night, V8 lost power  
From a soundbomb killin' the lone ranger drillin'  
You eager with ya mouth then just be a big proactive  
Ya actin' with ya heart then start preachin' with ya fatness  
The clear voyage psychic MC is a minion  
You cornered and you bagged in so where you gon' run to  
Used to get my mother's switches now I grant her wishes  
Never superstitious breakin' mirrors with the pitches  
Ya man is insane with that do-do on his chain  
Funkin' up the joint he pain, that ain't a bling that's a blang  
Besides can he rap about a real life vision  
Success lies a struggle that's what most of y'all are missin'  
Got so many sons I wish I had as many ones  
Clown nigga's raps get converted into guns  
Illuminati president it's a government official  
They dogs and they henchmen is comin' out to get you  
The age of Aquarius, the change is goin' on  
We gotta keep strivin' movin' on  
  
Ya dead wrong, ya wrong, ya know ya wrong  
(Ya know ya wrong for that)  
(Now why ya gotta go and do that)  
Ya dead wrong, ya wrong, ya know ya wrong  
And you know, you know you are ooh  
And you know, you know you are

For your epitaph, niggas laugh, chicks steady gas your ass  
Siphoning out your cash, seein' the door, the flash  
While I stay enclosed, walkin' out in my clothes  
She said, "I wouldn't trade it for nothing"  
  
You motherfuckin' right, wantin' this shit every night  
Finish up, I hold her tight, wearin' feelings on my sleeve  
Even when I had to leave, cooler than the evening breeze  
Do you believe?  
"I wouldn't trade it for nothing"  
  
The Division One leader, in the rebound with numerous shorties, off the post  
Goin' coast to coast, she on the hardwood, sub, I'm out the game  
She sayin', "Nah, he good", I mean  
"I wouldn't trade it for nothing"  
  
For no amount of dough, franchise this man  
Give him all the things you can  
Think long-term plans, he be bringin' in the fans  
Front-page magazine, listen to this lady scream:  
"I wouldn't trade it for nothing"  
  
Cause she know what's better for her  
Toppin' in the peckin' order  
Fluid like the runnin' water, nicest nigga? Kinda, sorta  
When he screamin' just the slaughter, no matter the quarter  
I get it  
"I wouldn't trade it for nothing"  
  
The club-house king, battin' practice, slug and swing  
Game time's anything, when I'm in, you're 'bout a minute  
Holdin' the bat, it's good as fact  
She's out the park, and comin' back  
She sayin'  
"I wouldn't trade it for nothing"  
  
Everywhere you sit you get a good view of the ballplayer and all  
And the famous hall inevitably will make a call  
Hangin' memorabilia from your walls  
This is why you can't trade me  
"I wouldn't trade it for nothing"  
  
You can put your money on a sure thing  
Certain profits will they bring  
Ceremonies are the ringer, in the White House thing  
Clear your mantle, the trophies I bring  
Do you wanna trade?  
"I wouldn't trade it for nothing"  
  
Cause in the end as a teammate  
You're lookin' for a back shoot, and go-to ball  
Leaves it all on the floor, always lookin' to score  
Pep-talks in the locker-room  
This is why you sing this tune  
"I wouldn't trade it for nothing"  
  
And injuries can't make me sit, I ball till you get out  
Hook off, no di-doubt, and all like get out  
I train for the pressure and come out fresher  
Equipped for the game, you know my name  
It makes me better  
A cheer, for the whole team, let's go, for the whole thing  
The ballad that you're holding, MVP voting  
And I, represent the sentiment, you're emoting  
As you say  
"I wouldn't trade it for nothing"  
  
The physical ability, with mental capability  
Legitimately places me inside of your vicinity  
And I ain't really seein' me vacatin' this community  
I'm stayin' here  
"I wouldn't trade it for nothing"  
  
I'm glad that you feel this way  
Here's where I like to play  
I need to hear it everyday, they cheer for me, say, "Ole"  
Wait a minute, "Andele"?  
I dunno, well, anyway  
"I wouldn't trade it for nothing"
