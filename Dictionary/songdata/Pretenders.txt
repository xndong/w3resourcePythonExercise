All my dreams  
Still relive you  
If this is what you left for me  
I forgive you  
Never do I despair  
When I kneel to say my prayers  
When slumber fills my head  
I'll be visiting your bed  
  
All my dreams  
Recollect you  
And so darling in a way  
Our love remains new  
Funny little things  
You touch my fingers and fondle my rings  
Then tenderly without violence  
We make love in perfect silence  
  
Come, come into my room again  
Come, come again  
Oh come, come into my gloom again  
End this solitude again  
  
I finally took that picture down  
I'd been staring at it for hours and hours  
Slipping in and out of consciousness  
But what I can't figure out  
Why did you do that?  
Disappear on me like that?  
Oh baby please come back where I can touch you  
Right here where I can see you  
  
Come, come into my room again  
Come, come again  
Oh come, come into my gloom again  
Break, break this solitude again  
  
All of my dreams of your affection  
Never have I known  
Such sweet perfection  
No drug-induced bliss  
Could ever reach the heights of this  
Eternal and so pure  
Help me to endure  
All my dreams

Narcissistic anorexic so unstuck but so pretty  
I love you  
[something?] : you're the only truth in this city  
Don't ever change  
Don't change good champagne for some sad idiot and then complain  
That's good advice  
But a lady who has two black eyes is not the best one to advise  
She's already been told twice  
  
Don't ever change (why oh why oh why oh)  
Would you ever change (oh oh oh)  
Please don't ever change  
You're almost perfect  
You're almost perfect  
You're almost perfect  
  
Paranoiac drug addicted pornographically afflicted  
Sleep with me  
Two legs a cock a woman's soul strange how this lady can control  
Oooh show them to me  
You can hardly see this woman only wants you for your money  
You who have not  
Come inside my hive where bees are busy making honey  
Oooh love is about  
  
Don't ever change (why oh why oh why oh)  
Would you ever change (oh oh oh)  
Please don't ever change  
You're almost perfect  
You're almost perfect  
You're almost perfect  
  
One two three one two three one two three  
Half of half and half of half and half of half and half of that  
  
Artistic repetitious people-phobically suspicious  
With an oversize charm  
Unemployable illegal you're a whole film by Don Siegel  
Oooh write me a song  
  
Go away and blow away and fade away and the next day  
You're back in the line  
If love is leaving everything for homelessness and nothing  
Ooh you'll be just fine  
  
Don't ever change (why oh why oh why oh)  
Would you ever change (the best part of Ohio)  
Please don't ever change  
You're almost perfect  
You're almost perfect  
You're almost perfect

There'll be no strings to bind your hands  
Not if my love can bind your heart  
And there's no need to take a stand  
For it was I who chose to start  
I see no reason to take me home  
I'm old enough to face the dawn  
  
Just call me angel of the morning, angel  
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, oh baby  
Just call me angel of the morning, angel  
Then slowly turn away from me  
  
Maybe the sun's light will be dim  
So it won't matter anyhow  
If morning's echo says we've sinned  
Well, it was what I wanted now  
And if we're the victims of the night  
I won't be blinded by the light  
  
Just call me angel of the morning, angel  
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, oh baby  
Just call me angel of the morning, angel  
Then slowly turn away  
I won't beg you to stay with me  
Through the tears of the day  
Of the years, oh baby baby, baby baby  
  
Just call me angel of the morning, angel  
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby  
Just call me angel of the morning, angel  
Just touch my cheek before you leave me  
Oh baby, baby, oh baby

You're not supposed to do that  
You know you're not allowed to  
But you seem to get some kind of kick  
Out of doing what you're not allowed to  
You deliberately defy the rules  
'Cause the law's upheld by fools  
Shit on that  
Bad boys get spanked  
  
You can look but don't touch  
But no you can't resist  
Don't you ever think about the consequence  
Guys like you never do  
That's the kind of stuff boys are made out of  
That's the kind of stuff girls are made out of  
Bad boys get spanked  
Bad boys get spanked  
  
You don't listen do you asshole  
Don't be a punk all your life  
Someone's gonna sort you out  
They'll try to make a man out of you  
Say yes sir, say no sir  
Say yes ma'am, say no m'am  
Shit on that  
Bad boys get spanked  
Bad boys get spanked  
  
Get spanked, get spanked  
Come here, get spanked  
Bad boys get spanked  
Come here, get spanked

I wrote a letter to you my friend  
So many letters that I never send  
I think about you at the day's end  
The time that we had  
I laughed in my bed  
The stupid things you said  
We were two birds of paradise  
  
When I was a little girl  
With clay horses and lambs on the shelf  
I caught frogs in ditches, listened for elves  
My friends and I had a world unto ourselves  
No grownups could find us when we  
Made our plans so secretly  
To run away and fly to be  
With the two birds of paradise  
  
Now once upon a time my mind still there wanders  
Back in the room the things I remember  
One time when we took off our clothes  
But you were cryin', cryin'  
You said nothing lasts forever  
We were happy together  
I thought about you in Stockholm and Rome  
Me in my hotel room  
You in your home  
This is the life they say that  
Dreams are made of  
Don't forget  
Please do forgive me  
I still have something you did give me  
Come into my dream with me and dream  
  
Please don't forget  
Do forgive me  
I still have something you did give me  
Come into my dream with me and dream  
Oh dream of paradise

Got brass in pocket  
Got bottle I'm gonna use it  
Intention I feel inventive  
Gonna make you, make you, make you notice  
  
Got motion restrained emotion  
Been driving Detroit leaning  
No reason just seems so pleasing  
Gonna make you, make you, make you notice  
  
Gonna use my arms  
Gonna use my legs  
Gonna use my style  
Gonna use my sidestep  
Gonna use my fingers  
Gonna use my, my, my imagination  
  
'Cause I gonna make you see  
There's nobody else here  
No one like me  
I'm special so special  
I gotta have some of your attention give it to me  
  
Got rhythm I can't miss a beat  
Got new skank it's so reet  
Got something I'm winking at you  
Gonna make you, make you, make you notice  
  
Gonna use my arms  
Gonna use my legs  
Gonna use my style  
Gonna use my sidestep  
Gonna use my fingers  
Gonna use my, my, my imagination  
  
'Cause I gonna make you see  
There's nobody else here  
No one like me  
I'm special, so special  
I gotta have some of your attention  
Give it to me  
'Cause I gonna make you see  
There's nobody else here  
No one like me  
I'm special, so special  
I gotta have some of your attention  
  
Give it to me

Break Up The Concrete  
  
There was a red brick road where I grew up on  
And a pretty stone wall round a fragrant lawn  
Fish in the pond that sparkled in the dawn  
But it ain't no more it's all gone gone gone  
  
[Chorus]  
Whoa!  
Ram it! Cram it! Grand Slam it!  
Break up the concrete, Break up the concrete  
Prod it! Sod it! Metal Rod it!  
Break up the concrete,  
Thwak it! Crack it! Line back it!  
Break up the concrete,  
Shake it! Bake it! Earthquake it!  
Break up the concrete  
  
And the depot over there right next to the tracks  
That the slaves put down, while breaking their backs  
But those Texas zoo no would ever get into a carriage  
Or anything that might lead to an interracial marriage  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now don't tell me its progress cause that's just a lie  
And don't even try to come with an excuse why!  
We we're so busy worrying about them dropping the bomb  
We didn't notice where our enemy was really coming from!  
  
Hey boys c'mon let's do it!  
  
Ram it! Cram it! Grand Slam it!!  
Break up the concrete,  
Prod it! Sod it! Metal Rod it!  
Break up the concrete  
Shake it! Bake it! Earthquake it!  
Break up the concrete  
  
Ram it! Slam it! Just cram it!  
One more time!  
Break up the concrete  
Break up the concrete  
  
Now he who laid it, come back here and raid it!

I'm the cleaning woman  
Here to clean up your mess  
I'm the clean up woman  
Here to clean up your mess  
I'm the cleaning woman  
Here to clean up your mess  
I'm the clean up woman  
Here to clean up your mess  
  
Women think men belong in resorts  
We watch the children  
They watch the sports  
A man wouldn't help us  
Even if he could  
While we clean up the mess  
He's made of the neighborhood  
  
I'm the cleaning woman  
Here to clean up your mess  
I'm the clean up woman  
Here to clean up your mess  
I'm the cleaning woman  
Here to clean up your mess  
I'm the clean up woman  
Here to clean up your mess  
  
Women refuse to witness the kill  
Of man's safaris and his battles of will  
She washes the wound he sustains in his fight  
She cradles him in her arms all night  
  
Woman is there  
At the end of the day  
She works as hard  
As a man can play  
She carries the blame  
She doesn't deserve  
She bears his name  
When he loses his nerve  
  
I'm the cleaning woman  
Here to clean up your mess  
I'm the clean up woman  
Here to clean up your mess  
I'm the cleaning woman  
Here to clean up your mess  
I'm the clean up woman  
Here to clean up your mess

Look at me  
High upon the hill  
You could say  
I'm on top of the world  
Baby - I'm blue  
All because of you  
I can see this city  
Crumble all around me  
Press me to your chest  
Block out the view  
Oh, whoa whoa whoa  
  
You made me  
Some kind of criminal  
You put me out-law  
Because I loved you  
  
In my time  
One thing I've learned  
If you play with fire  
You get burned  
Oh, baby, it's true  
I got burned by you  
I put everything I had  
Into a bag  
And trusted you to do  
What you didn't do  
Oh, whoa whoa whoa  
  
You made me  
Some kind of criminal  
You put me out-law  
Because l loved you  
  
The first thing I think when I wake up  
When can I see you?  
The last thing I think when I'm drifting off  
When will I see you?  
  
Oh. look at me  
I'm addicted still  
At first I refused,  
Now I just swallow the pill  
Oh, baby, won't you  
Fix me like you used to?  
I could spend my time in hell  
I might as well  
Cause hell is where I'm bound to dwell  
Without you  
Oh, whoa whoa whoa  
  
You made me  
Some kind of criminal  
You put me out-law  
Because I loved you

Remember the nights I cried  
You were doing that old Cuban slide  
All night I tried and tried  
I could not master the Cuban side.  
  
R'member the night I started to weep?  
Under lights you did the 'creep'.  
That night I could not sleep.  
Oh lord how goes the creep?  
  
[Chorus]  
AIy YI AIy Ya I wanna dance but my feet won't let me  
AIy YI YI AIy I wanna dance would someone help me  
AIy YI YI Ya- I wanna dance but my feet won't let me  
AIy AIy Ya  
  
Last night I could not talk  
On the street you did the Charring Cross walk  
Up and down I swoop and stalk.  
Only I can run, but I can't walk  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Remember the nights I cried  
You were doing that old Cuban slide  
All night I tried and tried  
I could not master the Cuban side.  
  
AIy YI AIy Ya I wanna dance but my feet won't let me  
AIy YI YI AIy I wanna dance would someone help me  
AIy YI YI Ya I wanna dance but my feet won't let me  
AIy AIy Ya-  
  
Now dance!

Dance!  
If you will  
Dance!  
On your capitol hill  
Dance!  
If you can  
Dance!  
Like a twentieth century man  
  
Take the people by the throat  
Give 'em a reason to give you a vote  
Take your audience up on stage  
Let them think you're a sage  
  
Dance!  
If you want  
Dance!  
Like you've got a house to haunt  
Dance!  
Like a freak  
Dance!  
Like you needed it all week  
  
Take your people by the hand  
Tell 'em you'll get 'em to the promised land  
Take your woman in the heat of the night  
Make her think you're right  
See'mon!  
  
Dance!  
Like a chimpanzee  
Dance!  
In the 'land of the free'  
Dance!  
Like a russian ballet  
Dance!  
Like a funky situe  
  
Let 'em know that you're well read  
Quote the things that jesus said  
Lift your face and your whiskey neat  
To get you up on your feet  
See'mon!

Way up in the sky  
Over the city, over Tokyo  
Silver light, summer moon  
You'll be over somebody's winter this afternoon  
While the dolphins swim in the sea  
You're going grey, my baby  
Still the war is waging endlessly  
Day after day, day after day  
  
Way up in the sky  
Over the city and lake Erie  
You remember the flats, you were there  
Out every night Mr. Moonlight  
  
Round and round and round we go  
Just like yesterday  
  
Way up in the sky  
Over the city where you sleep tonight  
The light outside your window blinks  
"Hotel, hotel, hotel"  
Open the blind and dream in a moonbeam  
  
When the war's finally over  
We'll meet again  
And pick up where we left off

Get to the heart  
Baby, the heart of the city  
Meet me in a fire fight  
Of lusty boys in candlelight  
Beat to the heart, baby the heart of the city  
Veins pop and cry for more  
And lick it off the killing floor  
  
D-d-d-downtown c'mon  
D-d-d-downtown c'mon  
D-d-d-downtown c'mon  
D-d-d-d-downtown akron!  
  
Move to the beat. Baby the beat of the city  
Rubber glove me when you love me  
Promise me protection  
Dance to the heat, baby the heat of the city  
Glorify my oozing head  
And raise me from the living dead  
  
D-d-d-downtown c'mon  
D-d-d-downtown c'mon  
D-d-d-downtown c'mon  
D-d-d-d-downtown akron!  
  
Downtown me - baby strip me  
Chop me, adopt me, bend me like a rubber dolly  
Downtown me - demolition me  
Raise me, appraise me, the portage hotel and me  
Downtown me - with a lobotomy  
Take me to the cuyahoga valley and make a man of me  
  
Get to the heart, baby the heart of the city  
Say you love it when you shove it  
Don't be sentimental  
Move to the heart, baby - the heart of the city  
This is where the future lies  
Beneath the burning sulphur skies  
  
D-d-d-downtown c'mon  
D-d-d-downtown c'mon  
D-d-d-downtown c'mon  
D-d-d-d-downtown akron!

I walk the streets at night  
Under artificial light  
Looking for somewhere to live  
I've been on the east side  
Where a lady can reside  
But, I'm waiting for you  
  
Waiting for you  
In the falling rain  
Oh heal me  
Heal me, again  
  
What's the cost of fame?  
What's in a name?  
Maybe, can you  
Vibrate and clarify  
So that even lowly I  
Can find the road that leads to you  
  
In the falling rain  
Oh heal me  
Heal me, again  
  
One more little heartache  
One more little heartache  
One more little earthquake  
Wash me down  
Wash me down  
  
Ghostly memory  
Come back to me  
Fill me and then  
Take me to your grave  
I promise to behave  
And let me in the whole  
Of you  
  
In the falling rain  
Oh heal me  
Heal me, again

I was born with my hand in a fist  
And my eyes shut tight  
Any wonder that I cannot resist  
Punchin' blindly in a fight  
The first time I saw swans flyin' to the sun  
I wanted to be one  
  
Like every mother's son  
When I saw my life had begun  
I wanted to be someone  
Like my brother and my one and only father  
And like every mother's son  
  
I was raised within a cause  
With a purpose to fulfill  
I was taught to defend what was mine  
And instructed not to kill  
My small mortal eyes can see eternity  
In the clouds that dissolve and then regroup endlessly  
  
Like every mother's son  
When a man showed me how to use a gun  
I wished I'd never need one  
Like my brother and my one and only father  
And like every mother's son  
  
Everything in domesticity  
Assumes its role better than me  
I'm a displaced person whose culture let me down  
I raise my own daughters in a pornographic town  
  
Like every mother's son  
I've lost some and some I've won  
Now I'm waiting for a new dawn  
Like my brother and my one and only father  
And like every mother's son

Fools must die  
So it shall be  
Take your place in history  
Show your face  
Don't be shy  
The world rejoices  
When fools die  
  
They die, they must die  
They die, they must die  
Everybody gather round  
Watch them falling to  
The ground  
  
Fools must die  
So it shall pass  
Bow your head  
Raise your glass  
Don't ask when  
Don't ask why  
Ask for mercy  
Cause fools die  
  
They die, they must die  
They die, they must die  
Everybody gather round  
Watch them stumble to  
The ground  
  
Fools must die  
One by one  
Indulge yourself  
As I have done  
As you are now  
So once was I  
Prepare for death  
Cause fools must die  
  
They die they must die  
They die they must die  
Everybody gather round  
Watch them falling to the ground.

May the good Lord be with you  
Down every road you roam  
And may sunshine and happiness  
Surround you when you're far from home  
And may you grow to be pround  
Dignified and true  
And do unto others  
As you'd have done to you  
Be courageous and be brave  
And in my heart you'll always stay  
Forever young (forever young)  
Forever young (forever young)  
May good fortune be with you  
May your guiding light be strong  
Build a stairway to heaven  
With a prince or a vagabond  
And may you never love in vain  
And in my heart you will remain  
Forever Young (forever young)  
Forever Young (forever Young)  
Forever Young  
Forever Young  
And when you finally fly away  
I'll be hoping that I served you well  
For all the wisdom of a lifetime  
No one can ever tell  
But whatever road you choose  
I'm right behind you, win or lose  
Forever Young (Forever Young)  
Forever Young (Forever Young)  
Forever Young, Forever Young  
For, forever young, forever Young

I remember you  
I remember the first time we met  
I may be a sentimental fool  
Forever in your debt  
For something I cannot forget  
I remember you  
  
I remember the first time we spoke  
The sound of your voice like a lover's tongue  
Got in my ear when I'd just begun  
To wonder if springtime was through  
I remember you  
  
How do we change so easily?  
You'll always be a part of me  
I thought you'd never go  
It shows you what I know  
  
I remember the first time we slept  
What a surprise to wake up to  
Someone I hardly knew  
From a sleep to a dream come true  
I remember you

If I'd known then  
If only I had known  
What, where or when  
I would of kept you on the phone  
Hindsight is tough  
It's so obvious  
Never enough for the two of us  
  
I would of tried a little harder  
I would have cried a little louder  
I would have lied with more aplomb  
I, I, I, I, I, I, I should have known  
  
When we made love  
Sometimes it was great  
Just once or twice  
I would have called it second rate  
Anyway the days passed by in peace  
I never though you needed  
More release  
  
I would of tried a little harder  
I would have cried a little louder  
I would have lied with more aplomb  
I, I, I, I, I, I, I should have known  
  
If I had...if, if, if  
I should have, I should have  
I could have, I could have  
Oh fuck, I really miss you  
I really miss you  
  
I should have tried a little harder  
I should have cried a whole lot louder  
I should have lied  
With more aplomb  
I, I, If only I, I should have known

Oh, why you look so sad, tears are in your eyes,  
Come on and come to me now, don't be ashamed to cry,  
Let me see you through, 'cause I've seen the dark side too.  
When the night falls on you, you don't know what to do,  
Nothing you confess could make me love you less,  
  
I'll stand by you,  
I'll stand by you, won't let nobody hurt you,  
I'll stand by you  
  
So if you're mad, get mad, don't hold it all inside,  
Come on and talk to me now.  
Hey there, what you got to hide?  
I get angry too, well, I'm a lot like you.  
When you're standing at the crossroads,  
And don't know which path to choose,  
Let me come along, 'cause even if you're wrong  
  
I'll stand by you,  
I'll stand by you, won't let nobody hurt you,  
I'll stand by you.  
Baby, even to your darkest hour, and I'll never desert you,  
I'll stand by you.  
And when, when the night falls on you baby,  
You're feeling all alone, won't be on your own,  
I'll stand by you.  
  
I'll stand by you, won't let nobody hurt you,  
I'll stand by you, baby even to your darkest hour,  
And I'll never desert you,  
I'll stand by you,  
  
I'll stand by you.  
I'll stand by you, won't let nobody hurt you,  
I'll stand by you, baby even to your darkest hour,  
And I'll never desert you  
I'll stand by you

Take a message to my love  
And don't say where you saw me  
Seven men crossed the river  
And they took all the money  
  
Color the wind  
And search deep within  
And by the light of the moon  
Light of the moon  
Light of the moon  
We'll begin again  
  
Secrets whispered in shadows  
While the village lay sleeping  
Guiding me to the answer  
Bang a drum and I'll follow  
  
Color the wind  
And search deep within  
And by the light of the moon  
Light of the moon  
Light of the moon  
We'll begin again  
  
Say they're taking the children  
Oh, I think they've forgotten  
Does their innocence wander  
On its way back to my love  
  
Color the wind  
And search deep within  
And by the light of the moon  
Light of the moon  
Light of the moon  
We'll begin again

The sun goes down  
The sky turns black  
I can hardly wait for you  
I can't believe the madness  
In everything you do  
I used to dream in black and white  
Now I see the world in a different light  
  
Your love colors, colors everything  
Your love colors, colors everything  
Your love colors, colors everything  
Your love colors, colors everything  
Oh oh  
Now come in to me  
Fill me and fill me  
Show me your colors baby  
Your love colors  
  
I slept in fear  
And woke in pain  
Till you came in close to me  
I was cold  
Like frozen rain  
Your kiss melted me  
You speak your mind just like a child  
Won't be defined by when you smile  
  
Your love colors, colors everything  
Your love colors, colors everything  
Your love colors, colors everything  
Your love colors, colors everything  
Oh oh  
Now come in to me  
Fill me and fill me  
Show me your colors baby  
Your love colors  
  
Your love colors everything  
Your love colors everything  
Your love colors everything  
Your love colors everything

I tried to talk to my baby  
I said no, no, no, no baby  
Please don't cry  
No, no, no baby please  
'Cause all of the leaves come down  
Every time babies cry  
All of the leaves come down  
  
I put my arms around my baby  
I said hush, hush, hush, hush  
Baby sleep tight now  
Hush, hush, hush baby, sleep  
'Cause all of the birds start to sing  
Every time babies dream  
All of the birds start to sing  
  
Nobody wants to see  
Lovers of today happy  
So assumed they're going to part  
Nobody wants to be with someone  
So afraid they'll be left with  
A broken heart  
  
I kissed the eyes of my baby  
I said dream, dream, dream, dream  
Baby all night long  
Dream, dream, dream all the night  
'Cause all of the stars in the skies  
Twinkle on baby's eyes  
All of the stars in the skies  
  
I tried to talk to you baby  
No no  
No I'll never feel  
Like a man in a man's world

I don't understand how the sun keeps shining  
And I don't understand why the seasons change  
And I don't have a clue what makes the river flow  
Loving you is all I know  
  
I can't tell you why stars come out in the evening  
And I can't tell you where they go when they're gone  
And I don't have a clue what makes a flower grow  
Loving you is all I know  
  
I don't know how the world keeps on spinning around  
I don't know why the sky don't come falling down  
I just know that I would die without your touch  
I don't know what a time just to reach the shore  
Just know that I'll need you for forever more  
Knowing that I guess I know it now  
  
I can't really say if there is a heaven  
But I feel like it's here when I feel you near me, baby  
If angels are real, they must know how I feel  
Cause loving you is all I know

Now the reason we're here  
As man and woman  
Is to love each other  
Take care of each other  
When love walks in the room  
Everybody stand up  
Oh it's good, good, good  
Like Brigitte Bardot  
  
Now look at the people  
In the streets, in the bars  
We are all of us in the gutter  
But some of us are looking at the stars  
Look round the room  
Life is unkind  
We fall but we keep gettin' up  
Over and over and over and over and over and over  
  
Me and you, every night, every day  
We'll be together always this way  
Your eyes are blue like the heavens above  
Talk to me darlin' with a message of love  
  
Now the reason we're here  
Every man, every woman  
Is to help each other  
Stand by each other  
When love walks in the room  
Everybody stand up  
Oh it's good, good good  
Say i love you, i love you, i love you, i love you, i love you, i love you  
  
Talk to me darlin'

The middle of the road is trying to find me  
I'm standing in the middle of life with my plans behind me  
Well I got a smile for everyone I meet  
As long as you don't try dragging my bay  
Or dropping the bomb on my street  
  
Now come on baby  
Get in the road  
Oh come on now  
In the middle of the road, yeah  
  
In the middle of the road you see the darnedest things  
Like fat guys driving 'round in jeeps through the city  
Wearing big diamond rings and silk suits  
Past corrugated tin shacks full up with kids  
Oh man I don't mean a Hampstead nursery  
When you own a big chunk of the bloody third world  
The babies just come with the scenery  
  
Oh come on baby  
Get in the road  
Oh come on now  
In the middle of the road, yeah  
  
One...two...three...four...  
  
The middle of the road is no private cul-de-sac  
I can't get from the cab to the curb  
Without some little jerk on my back  
Don't harass me, can't you tell  
I'm going home, I'm tired as hell  
I'm not the cat I used to be  
I got a kid, I'm thirty-three  
  
Baby, get in the road  
Come on now  
In the middle of the road  
Yeah

I'll come in your car to talk business,  
No business, no money talk.  
Zero in on my full of intentions,  
I think you got it because you pulled up and stopped.  
If money is the root of all evil,  
I'm begging at the feet of the devil.  
Talk to me please,  
Money talk to me.  
  
Twenty gets you straight,  
Forty gets you other,  
Think of what a hundred could do.  
I've been gifted with the thing that you want,  
Who's better than who?  
Never underestimate a woman like me,  
The kids have got to eat,  
And man, that's reality, you see.  
Money talk to me.  
  
You're so deluded,  
You think that I'm real.  
You pass your hormones off as love,  
For five minutes you feel.  
You can buy a squeegee little silicone sack,  
But it won't feed the world  
Like the ones that I pack naturally.  
Money talk to me.

I went back to Ohio  
But my city was gone  
There was no train station  
There was no downtown  
South Howard had disappeared  
All my favorite places  
My city had been pulled down  
Reduced to parking spaces  
A, o, way to go Ohio  
  
Well I went back to Ohio  
But my family was gone  
I stood on the back porch  
There was nobody home  
I was stunned and amazed  
My childhood memories  
Slowly swirled past  
Like the wind through the trees  
A, o, oh way to go Ohio  
  
I went back to Ohio  
But my pretty countryside  
Had been paved down the middle  
By a government that had no pride  
The farms of Ohio  
Had been replaced by shopping malls  
And Muzak filled the air  
From Seneca to Cuyahoga falls  
Said, a, o, oh way to go Ohio

Mystery achievement  
Don't breathe down my neck no  
I got no trophies on display  
I sign them away  
I mean what the heck  
All of your promises  
Don't fill me with pride no  
I just wanna get out on the floor  
And do the Cuban slide, slide, slide, slide  
  
But every day, every nighttime I find  
Mystery achievement  
You're on my mind  
And every day, every nighttime I feel  
Mystery achievement you're so unreal  
  
Mystery achievement  
Where's my sandy beach? Yeah  
I had my dreams like everybody else  
But they're out of reach  
I said right out of reach  
I could ignore you  
Your demands are unending  
I got no tears on my ice cream but you know me  
I love pretending  
  
But every day, every nighttime I find  
Mystery achievement  
You're on my mind  
And every day, every nighttime I feel  
Mystery achievement you're so unreal

I see him standing silhouetted  
In the lamp-light  
I cross the street  
And I quicken my pace  
He cups his hands and he  
Lights a cigarette  
I find myself in the bones of his face  
  
It's just the night in my veins  
Oh  
Making me crawl in the dust again  
It's just the night  
Under my skin  
Slipping it in  
  
He's got his hands in my hair  
And his lips everywhere  
Oh yeah  
It feels good  
It's alright  
Even if it's just  
The night in my veins  
  
He's got me up against the back of a  
Pick-up truck  
Out of sight of the neon and glare  
We might as well be on a beach  
Under the moonlight  
Love's language reads the same  
Anywhere yeah  
  
It's just the night in my veins  
Oh  
Making me crawl in the dust again  
It's just the night  
Under my skin  
Slipping it in  
  
He's got his chest on my back  
Across a new Cadillac  
Oh yeah  
It feels good  
It's alright  
Even if it's just  
The night in my veins  
Even if it's just the night in my veins  
  
I've got my head on the  
Kerb and I can't produce  
A word  
Oh year  
It feels good  
It's alright  
Even if it's just  
The night in my veins  
  
It feels good  
It's alright  
Even if it's just  
The night in my veins  
  
Even if it's just  
The night in my veins  
It feels good  
It's alright

Aint nobody loves me like my baby  
No body can make me feel the way I feel  
Aint nobody loves me like my baby  
I know my baby love for me is real  
  
When I'm down she brings me round  
She takes me where I need to be  
  
Aint nobody loves me like my baby  
Nobody can put that smile back on my face  
  
Aint nobody loves me like my baby  
My baby's love can't be replaced  
  
When I'm down she brings me round  
She takes me where I need to be  
  
Aint nobody loves me like my baby  
No body can make me feel the way that I feel  
  
Aint nobody loves me like my baby  
I know my baby love for me is real  
  
Aint nobody loves me like my baby  
Nobody can put that smile back on my face  
  
Aint nobody loves me like my baby  
My baby's love can't be replaced  
  
Aint nobody loves me like my baby  
No body can make me feel the way that I feel  
  
Aint nobody loves me like my baby  
I know my baby love for me is real  
  
Aint nobody loves me like my baby  
No body can hold me and loves me like she does

So your girlfriend wants to be a popstar  
And beat the charts outta me  
She wants to move a million units, man  
Probably just to prove she can  
And after a couple of hits  
She'll be buying a new pair of mitts  
I can see just where she's heading  
She's as predictable as Armageddon  
  
Oh, they don't make 'em like they use to  
They don't make 'em like they use to  
No, they don't make 'em like they use to  
You should have just stuck with me  
  
Your girlfriend wants to be a popstar  
And live in Primrose Hill  
She'll join the meritocracy  
And get to meet all of rock's aristocracy  
And be someone everyone knows  
Who all the designers send all their new clothes  
But when she starts to look like Kylie Minogue  
She might even get her picture in Vogue  
  
Baby, they don't make 'em like they use to  
They don't make 'em like they use to  
No, they don't make 'em like they use to  
You should have just stuck with me  
  
Your baby wants to be a popstar  
Probably just to spite me  
She thinks it's all so easy to get to the top  
But a girl like that, she won't know where to stop  
And when her most recent therapist  
Suggests that maybe she become a Buddhist  
She might even consider giving up red meat  
Man, you're gonna look back to when your life was so sweet  
  
You know they just don't make 'em like they used to  
No, they don't make 'em like they use to  
They just don't make 'em like they use to

I like the way you cross the street 'cause your precious  
Moving through the Cleveland heat how precious  
Taking rides and all the kicks was so precious  
But you know I was shittin' bricks 'cause I'm precious  
  
Made me want to, made me want to, you made me make it  
Oh, you're so mean  
  
East 55th and Euclid avenue was real precious  
Hotel sterling coming into view how precious  
It's a pity that you bruised my hip 'cause I'm precious  
You shouldn't let your manners slip you're too precious  
  
Made me want to, made me want to, you made me make it  
Oh, you're so mean  
  
We went around and round and round and round and round the Shoreway  
We was gonna do it do it do it on the pavement  
Oh maybe maybe I'm gonna have a baby  
We was a duet oh we do it all night  
  
I was feeling kind of ethereal 'cause I'm precious  
I had my eye on your imperial you're so precious  
Now Howard the duck and Mr Stress both stayed  
"Trapped in a world that they never made"  
But not me baby I'm too precious  
Fuck off  
  
Made me want to, made me want to, you made me make it  
Oh, you're so mean

Your private life drama baby leave me out  
(repeat 3 times)  
J'ai les glands with your theatrics  
Your acting's a drag  
It's o.k. on TV 'cause you can turn it off  
But don't try me  
Yes your marriage is a tragedy  
But it's not my concern  
I'm very superficial I hate anything official  
  
[Chorus:]  
Your private life drama baby leave me out  
(repeat 3 times)  
(backup chorus)  
You've been lying to someone and now me  
Stop  
(repeat 3 times)  
  
Your sentimental gestures only bore me to death  
You've made a desperate appeal now save your breath  
Attachment to obligation through guilt and regret  
Shit that's so wet  
And your sex life complications are not my fascinations  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You asked me for advice I said use the door  
But you're still clinging to somebody you deplore  
And now you want to use me for emotional blackmail  
I just feel pity when you lie, contempt when you cry  
  
[Chorus]

I'm as solid as a rock  
Throw me at the powers that be  
I'm as solid as a rock  
Throw me at the powers that be  
I'm as user friendly as a lead-filled glove  
Rebel rock me  
  
Hey!  
  
I've got money in the bank  
Come with me and you can have it for free  
I've got money earning interest in the bank  
Come with me and you can have it for free  
I've got assets big as holes up in the sky  
Rebel rock me  
  
Hey!  
  
I'm as heavy as a crowd in east l.a.  
Fling me at the oppressor and flee  
  
I'm as heavy as a crowd in east l.a.  
Fling me at the oppressor and flee  
  
I'm a seething burning moving mass of love  
Rebel rock me  
  
Hey!

Cats like me and you  
Have got laws  
That they adhere to  
Laws outside the laws  
As laid down  
By those we don't subscribe to  
The world is getting stranger  
But we'll never lose heart  
We can't just wait for the  
Old guard to die  
Before we can  
Make a new start  
  
Bring on the revolution  
(keep the pressure on)  
I want to die for something  
Bring on the revolution  
I want to die for something  
Bring on the revolution  
I want to die for something  
Bring on the revolution  
I don't want to die for nothing  
  
For every freedom fighter  
I want to hold on tighter  
To the hope and will you gave  
You were the brave  
You were the brave  
And one day  
When I hear your children sing  
Freedom will ring  
Freedom!  
  
When we watch the children play  
Remember  
How the privileged classes grew  
And from this day  
We set out  
To undo what won't undo  
Looking for the grand  
In the minute  
Every breath justifies  
Every step that we take  
To remove what the powers that be  
Can't prove  
And the children will  
Understand why  
  
Bring on the revolution  
(keep the pressure on)  
I want to die for something  
Bring on the revolution  
I want to die for something  
Bring on the revolution  
I don't want to die for nothing  
Bring on the revolution  
I want to die for something

When you came into  
My room last night  
And took off all your clothes  
Did you think I would resist  
Letting you inside  
Did you think I could resist you  
My favorite Samurai  
  
You swam across the bedroom  
Drunk on my champagne  
You got into the air  
Across the River Wye  
And pushed aside your headstone  
My favorite Samurai  
  
Then you showed me something  
I didn't know  
How to let go  
I was falling  
Through the Tivoli sky  
Expecting to fly  
Expecting to fly  
  
When I stood beside your tomb  
Last night  
Recalling how you rose  
Did you think I would persist  
Refusing to die  
See how I've persisted  
My favorite Samurai

I've really made a fool of myself  
I hit the wall but it never bothered you at all  
Oohhh  
My pony bolted out too soon  
Left me howling at the moon  
  
You are my saving grace (oo my saving grace)  
You put me in my place (you put me in my place)  
I see your smiling face (I see your smiling face)  
The clouds disappear, and blue skies fill the space  
You are my saving grace  
  
I didn't know what I was s'posed to be  
I tried to bluff, but I never offered you enough,  
Oohh  
Now I'm feeling the remorse  
I want you back because of course  
  
You are my saving grace (oo my saving grace)  
You put me in my place (you put me in my place)  
I see your smiling face (I see your smiling face)  
The clouds disappear, and blue skies fill the space  
You are my saving grace  
  
Do you remember when, you gave your heart to me  
I want it back again, I want it back again  
Oh baby, Sweet baby  
  
Won't you reconsider me?  
Coz as anyone can see..  
  
You are my saving grace (oo my saving grace)  
You put me in my place (you put me in my place)  
I see your smiling face (I see your smiling face)  
The clouds disappear, and blue skies fill the space  
You are my saving grace  
You are my saving grace  
  
You are my saving grace  
You put me in my place  
I see your smiling face (I see your smiling face)  
The clouds disappear, and blue skies fill the space  
You are my saving grace  
You are my saving grace  
You are my saving grace

The mid twenty joys around a heart that's black and blue  
Tattooed love boys  
I tore my knees up getting to you  
'Cause I needed  
To find out what the thing was for  
Been reading  
But man the time came to explore  
  
I went apewire 'cause I thought  
Like I'd like it little tease  
But I didn't mean it  
But you mess with the goods doll, honey you gotta pay, yeah  
  
A good time was guaranteed for one and all  
The tattoos did target practice in the hall  
While waiting for their number to get called out  
I, I, I, I found out what the wait was about  
  
I was a good time, yeah, I got pretty good  
At changing tires upstairs bro  
I shot my mouth off and you showed me what that hole was for  
  
Now I see you  
All impressed and half undressed  
You got paint stick all over the scars and lumps and bumps  
Tattooed love boys  
Have got you where I used to lay  
Well ha ha too bad, but you know what they say  
"Stop snivellin', you're gonna make some plastic surgeon a rich man"  
  
Oh, but the prestige and the glory  
Another human interest story  
You are that

I'm the adulteress  
But I didn't want to be and I'm convenient  
And I make good tea  
I stand accused  
Of the worst crime in history  
That's my mystery  
I'm the adulteress  
  
I go to the park  
With a bag of crumbs for the birds  
That's where we meet without words  
He takes my hand  
And stares into the wood  
There's nothing to understand  
It's understood  
I'm the adulteress  
  
Look at the fool  
Made up to go out  
She's desperate and lonely  
But she's puttin' it about  
Look at the spinster  
Comin' down off the shelf  
She's in love and she hates herself  
  
Don't try to stop me  
Don't get in my way  
It's too late  
I've made my play  
Does misery love company  
I'll be in the bar  
You'll find me

Just before it rains  
The wind whips 'round the balcony  
And the sky closes on the English roses  
And she'll be pacin'  
'Round and 'round and 'round and 'round her room  
These storms always find here to remind her  
  
To the endless sky  
The pink over grey  
She looks for an answer  
But it's too late  
Maybe it's true  
Some things were just never meant to be  
Maybe not  
  
This is a story  
Fruit cut from the vine  
Forgot and left to rot  
Long before its time  
This is a story  
About the girl who lived next door  
Looking for someone to hold  
  
A wish made on a star  
Brought her here tonight  
At a courtyard she waits  
A thousand broken dates  
But she holds the hymnal  
Where so carefully pressed  
Is the English rose she laid to rest  
  
It's only a story  
Flowers in full bloom  
Bouquets in every room  
Ooh, this is a story  
Fruit cut from the vine  
Looking for someone to hold

Such a drag to want something sometime  
One thing leads to another I know  
Was a time wanted you for mine  
Nobody knew  
You arrived like a day  
And passed like a cloud  
I made a wish, I said it out loud  
Out loud in a crowd  
Everybody heard  
'twas the talk of the town  
  
It's not my place to know what you feel  
I'd like to know but why should i?  
Who were you then, who are you now?  
Common labourer by night, by day highbrow  
Back in my room I wonder, then i  
Sit on the bed, look at the sky  
Up in the sky  
Clouds rearrange  
Like the talk of the town  
  
Maybe tomorrow, maybe someday  
Maybe tomorrow, maybe someday  
You've changed your place in this world  
You've changed your place in this world  
  
Oh but it's hard to live by the rules  
I never could and still never do  
The rules and such never bothered you  
You call the shots and they follow  
I watch you still from a distance then go  
Back to my room, you never know  
I want you, I want you but now  
Who's the talk of the town?

This is a mercy mission  
From a faceless messenger who don't want to see you hit  
Here's the word, listen to it  
Somebody that you used to know is back in town  
You better go  
  
This is a mercy mission  
A voice you'll never hear again from a southside call box  
Winged demons are the hardest to outfox  
The same one you lost on the run  
Gonna show you that it ain't no fun  
  
You better get out of town you're gonna get hit  
I didn't mean to get you...  
  
This is a mercy mission  
You'll find your schedule underneath the door  
All of the arrangements have been made  
Major expenses have been paid as you know  
Don't forget the last details  
Accept no parcels in the mail

It's a thin line between love and hate  
It's a thin line between love and hate  
  
It's five o'clock in the morning  
And you're just getting in  
You knock on the front door  
And a voice sweet and low says  
"who is it?"  
She opens up the door and lets you in  
Never once asks where have you been  
She says "are you hungry?  
Did you eat yet?  
Let me hang up your coat  
Pass me your hat"  
All the time she's smiling  
Never once raises her voice  
It's five o'clock in the morning  
You don't give it a second thought  
  
It's a thin line between love and hate  
(repeat)  
  
The sweetest woman in the world  
Could be the meanest woman in the world  
If you make her that way  
You keep hurting her  
She'll keep being quiet  
She might be holding something inside  
That'll really, really hurt you one day  
  
I see you're in the hospital  
Bandaged from foot to head  
In a state of shock  
Just that much from being dead  
You couldn't believe the girl  
Would do something like this, ha  
You didn't think the girl had the nerve  
But here you are  
I guess action speaks louder than words  
  
It's a thin line between love and hate  
(repeat)

Hush little baby, don't you cry  
When we get to Tucson you'll see why  
We left the snowstorms and the thunder and rain  
For the desert sun, we're gonna be born again  
What's important in this world  
A little boy, a little girl  
  
Hush little darling, go to sleep  
Look out the window and count the sheep  
That dot the hillsides and the fields of wheat  
Across America as we cross America  
What's important here today  
The broken line on the highway  
  
All the love in the world for you, girl  
Thumbelina in a great big scary world  
All the love in the world for you, girl  
Take my hand and we'll make it through this world  
  
Hush little baby, my poor little thing  
You've been shuffled about like a pawned wedding ring  
It must seem strange, love was here then gone  
And the Oklahoma sunrise becomes the Amarillo dawn  
What's important in this life  
Ask the man who's lost his wife

Nobody's perfect  
Not even a perfect stranger  
But oh what a gal  
She was such a perfect stranger  
And you're the best in your field  
In your office with your girls  
And desk and leather chair  
Thought that time was on your side  
But now it's time the avenger  
  
Nobody's permanent  
Everything's on loan here  
Even your wife and kids  
Could be gone next year  
And with what you have left  
You'll be forever under pressure  
To support her  
And a lover who looks strangely  
Like time the avenger  
  
Time, time, hear the bells chime  
Over the harbor and the city  
Time, one more vodka and lime  
To help paralyze that tiny little tick, tick, tick, tick  
  
Nobody's perfect  
Not even a perfect gent  
When your property took the a train  
I wonder where your manners went  
You were standing at the station  
In your briefcase  
Was your aftershave and underwear  
Can you hear the whistle blow?  
Sounds like time the avenger  
  
Time, time, hear the bells chime  
Over the harbor and the city  
Time to kill another bottle of wine  
To help paralyze that tiny little tick, tick, tick, tick

Don't you go away  
C'mon get close to me  
The hassles of the day  
Have made a real mess of me  
  
The moon is in the sky  
And the stars are out tonight  
They shimmer in the pools of your eyes  
In the moonlight  
  
You're so nice to touch  
Lovely to look at  
Touch, touch  
In the tradition of love  
  
Hear the summer breeze  
All the nighttime's listening  
Your eyes are sparkling now  
And their oceans glistening  
  
Sail upon a sea  
Of love filling the room  
Lilacs seem to be  
Everywhere with their perfume  
  
Love, love  
Love, love  
Love, love  
  
You can in a breath  
Blow the storm clouds out the sky  
A hurricane retreats  
In the blinking of your eye  
A flame within my heart  
Is ignited by your voice  
C'mon baby now  
Let's make love our final choice  
  
Ooh you're nice to touch  
Lovely to look at  
Touch, touch  
In the tradition of love  
  
Love, love  
Love, love  
Love, love

Miguel has set up home  
With a woman half my age  
A half-wit in a leotard  
Stands on my stage  
  
The standards have fallen  
My value has dropped  
But don't shed a tear  
Some walk like they own the place  
Whilst others creep in fear  
  
Try if you can  
To walk like a man  
But if you don't come near  
You've got to fly like an eagle  
Prowl like a lion in Africa  
Leap like a salmon home from the sea  
To keep up with me  
You've got to walk like a panther tonight  
  
The old home town just looks the same  
Like a derelict man who has died out of shame  
Like a jumble sale left out in the rain  
It's not good  
It's not right  
  
The standards have fallen  
My value has dropped  
But don't shed a tear  
Some walk like they own the place  
Whilst others creep in fear  
  
Try if you can  
To walk like a man  
But if you don't come near  
You've got to fly like an eagle  
Prowl like a lion in Africa  
Leap like a salmon home from the sea  
To keep up with me  
You've got to walk like a panther tonight  
  
Where did you leave your self respect  
You like look like a reptile  
Your house is a wreck  
Your existence an insult  
And stains that are suspect  
Cover your clothes  
  
The standards have fallen  
My value has dropped  
But don't shed a tear  
Some walk like they own the place  
Whilst others creep in fear  
  
Try if you can  
To walk like a man  
But if you don't come near  
You've got to fly like an eagle  
Prowl like a lion in Africa  
Leap like a salmon home from the sea  
To keep up with me  
You've got to walk like a panther tonight  
Walk like a panther tonight  
To keep up with me you've go

Take, take, take, takin' what you don't need  
You'll get, get, gettin' what you don't need  
Stand back, take a look and take heed  
All the children in god's kingdom bleed  
See the networks of concrete and steel  
They've no mystery but what they reveal  
Tells a story of a future that's void  
Of the beauty and the majesty that life on  
Earth is meant to be  
  
Talk, talk, talk, talk about the government  
And not a word about political favor  
Everything touched is my political choice  
The life you take is your political voice  
The sacred cows come crashing to their knees  
Golden harvest reaped without intelligence  
There's no chance between the heavens and the seas  
In a blood bath don't laugh  
Grab your piece of golden calf  
  
Waste not want not pick it up  
Waste not want not pick it up  
Waste not want not pick it up  
Waste not want not  
  
Do unto others as you wish be done to you  
There's a million lies 'round everything true  
You slaughter when you feast  
You disrespect the beast  
Make our beds and lie there, take your share  
  
Waste not want not pick it up  
Waste not want not pick it up  
Waste not want not pick it up  
Pick it up and eat it  
Waste not want not

Oh, Saturday night  
Mmm, everyone's having fun  
I'm down at the laundromat  
Trying to get my washing done  
Like I done before  
Time and time again  
Watching the clothes go 'round  
Another week sees its end  
  
Watching the clothes go 'round  
Watching the clothes go 'round  
Watching the clothes go 'round  
Watching the clothes go 'round  
  
Oh, I've been working hard  
Mmm, trying to make some money  
"would you like sour cream  
On your potato, honey?"  
I been kissing ass  
Trying to keep it clean  
Serving the middle class  
Yeah, it's a clean routine  
  
Watching the clothes go 'round  
Watching the clothes go 'round  
Watching the clothes go 'round  
Watching the clothes go 'round  
  
There go the whites  
Mmm, getting whiter  
There go the colors  
Getting brighter  
There go the dedicates  
Through the final rinse  
There goes my Saturday night  
I go without a fight  
  
Watching the clothes go 'round  
Watching the clothes go 'round  
Watching the clothes go 'round  
Watching the clothes go 'round

When I change my life  
There'll be no more disgrace  
The deeds of my past  
Will be erased  
  
And you'll forgive me  
Then you will come back  
Hold my hand and say "I still love you"  
When I change my life  
  
When I change my life  
And all the scars have faded  
I'll be someone you look up to  
Not excused when your friends come around  
  
And you'll want me always to be there  
You'll be proud to say "I'm with her"  
When I change my life  
  
I want a place in the sun - I do  
I want to be in love with someone  
I want to forget every regret  
And all those rotten things that I put you through  
  
When I change my life  
And the idiot me  
Leaves this town forever  
Leaves us to be  
Together - for the rest of our lives  
Happily forever and ever  
When I change my life

Went out on the balcony in the middle of the night  
The hotel was dark except for just one light  
Television burning in the other room  
I couldn't sleep so I put on some of your  
Hollywood perfume  
  
I went out on the balcony and looked across the way  
Some guy was shadow boxing, he looked like sugar ray  
I was feeling dizzy - began to swoon  
Was it his punch or was it just your  
Hollywood perfume?  
  
I feel like a fugitive escaped from my life  
Seeking refuge in the sensual heat  
These paper-thin walls make me party to calls  
Of love wafting through the room  
The night jasmine bloom  
Of your Hollywood perfume  
  
I went out on the balcony to clear my head  
I was burning up in my queen-sized bed  
Down on the strip beneath the billboard moon  
Teenaged girls look for love in the  
Neon sex and doom  
Of your Hollywood perfume  
  
I went out on the balcony with your photograph  
I dropped it in the pool and that made me laugh  
You like your tan but you don't like to swim  
Meanwhile I feel like I'm drowning in  
Neon sex and doom  
The night jasmine bloom  
Of your Hollywood perfume

It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart  
Without saying a word you can light up the dark  
Try as I may I could never explain  
What I hear when you don't say a thing  
  
The smile on your face lets me know that you need me  
There's a truth in your eyes sayin' you'll never leave me  
The touch of your hand says you'll catch me wherever I fall  
You say it best when you say nothing at all  
  
All day long I can hear people talking out loud  
But when you hold me near, you drown out the crowd  
Old Mr. Webster could never define  
What's being said between your heart and mine  
  
The smile on your face lets me know that you need me  
There's a truth in your eyes sayin' you'll never leave me  
The touch of your hand says you'll catch me wherever I fall  
You say it best when you say nothing at all  
  
The smile on your face lets me know that you need me  
There's a truth in your eyes sayin' you'll never leave me  
The touch of your hand says you'll catch me wherever I fall  
You say it best when you say nothing at all

That old train keeps blowing  
Through the center of this town  
Restores my faith  
When the chips are down  
  
It don't take no passenger  
Since the streets got re-arranged  
But that whistle still blows  
Because one thing never changed  
  
The boy I was loving  
Had to say so long  
Back to a world  
Where I don't belong  
  
It affected me so  
You could say I was deranged  
But that whistles gonna blow  
Because one thing never changed  
  
Speak to me  
Speak to me again  
Speak to me  
Speak to me again  
  
That old train keeps blowing  
I can hear it in the night  
I hold onto myself  
Its gonna be alright  
  
People come and go  
Like cars changing lanes  
But that whistles gonna blow  
Because one thing never changed
