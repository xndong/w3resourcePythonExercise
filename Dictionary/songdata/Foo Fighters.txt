Let's change the subject to someone else  
You know lately I've been subject to change  
Normally I reel in the strange  
Hangover, I'm older  
  
You're one to talk, the heart is a clock  
Just like a bomb it keeps on ticking away  
Counting down to detonate  
You will need an army to summon me  
  
It doesn't matter much to me  
If it doesn't matter much to you, ooh, ooh  
It doesn't matter much to me  
If it doesn't matter much to you  
  
It's just a matter of time before, before  
It's just a matter of time before, before  
And though I hate to rewind before, before  
It's just a matter of time  
  
My past is getting us nowhere fast  
I was never one for taking things slow  
Nowhere seems like somewhere to go  
Come over, and over  
  
Doing my time for line after line  
When will I learn to sing these crimes to myself?  
Prisoners to share a cell with  
I'm holding, still holding  
Holding you in  
  
It doesn't matter much to me  
If it doesn't matter much to you, ooh, ooh  
It doesn't matter much to me  
If it doesn't matter much to you  
  
It's just a matter of time before, before  
It's just a matter of time before, before  
And though I hate to rewind before, before  
It's just a matter of time  
  
Where the hell are you? Ooh, ooh  
Where the hell are you? Ooh, ooh  
Where the hell are you?  
  
It's just a matter of time before, before  
It's just a matter of time before, before  
And though I hate to rewind before, before  
It's just a matter of time  
  
What does it matter now?  
What does it matter now?  
What does it matter now?  
What does it matter now?  
It's just a matter of time  
Time

Dear Haley  
Can you save me from  
The borrowed cloud I'm on  
All you've gotta do is try  
Pray you're just getting by  
  
Hey wait I thought you made it  
How'd your bottled crown fall off  
Tell me how'd you get so tired  
Fade it down to the wire  
  
Try living a lie and kicking out  
The same old guise  
Wasting time  
  
So very ordinary  
Wait until my bomb goes off  
See the actors run and hide  
Fake it all in stride  
  
One day we all can say where we're gone  
And haunt the ground we're from  
Everything's so open wide  
Hear within the divide  
  
Try living a lie and kicking out  
The same old guise  
Wasting time  
  
Ain't it the life  
Ain't it the life  
Ain't it the life  
Got no crime  
Just sail on by  
Sail on by  
Ain't it the life  
  
Try living a lie and kicking out  
The same old guise  
Wasting time

When she goes storming out  
I run for cover  
Rolling like thunder clouds  
Hanging above her  
  
Ring in the witching hour  
Spells that I'm singing  
Rain come and drown me out  
Sinking deep alone  
  
Can you go another round?  
I will follow you down and out  
Lets go another round  
I will follow you down and  
  
We could just lay around  
Stare at the ceiling  
Want to forget about  
One for the feeling  
  
Room full of photographs  
Box full of letters  
Come on make it last  
Nothing else matters right now  
  
Can you go another round?  
I will follow you down and out  
Lets go another round  
I will follow you down and out  
  
Can you go another round?  
I will follow you down and out  
Lets go another round  
I will follow you down and out  
  
Lets go another round  
I will bother you down and out  
Lets go another round  
I will follow you down and out

Ain't that the way it always starts  
A simple round of conversation  
Became a shameful equation  
I flipped you station to station  
  
Hey, don't go and turn the other way  
Don't say there's nothing more to say  
Come on, hear me out, hush, hush, settle down  
Button up don't make a sound  
  
Shame, shame, go away  
Come again some other day  
You used to say I couldn't save you enough  
So I've been savin' it up, I started savin' it up  
  
And when you said I couldn't give you enough,  
I started givin' you up, I started givin' you up  
You are not me, Arlandria, Arlandria,  
You and what army, Arlandria, Arlandria  
Oh God you gotta make it stop  
  
Chase all of those memories away  
Save them all for another day  
Don't you remember it was rain that drowned you  
  
Wait, I wanna see if you can change  
I wanna keep all I can take  
I feel much better now  
Use me up, spit me out, let me be your hand-me-down  
Fame, fame, go away, come again some other day  
  
You used to say I couldn't save you enough  
So I've been savin' it up, I started savin' it up  
And when you said I couldn't give you enough  
I started givin' you up, I started givin' you up  
You are not me, Arlandria, Arlandria  
You and what army, Arlandria, Arlandria  
Oh God you gotta make it stop  
  
My sweet Virginia  
I'm the same as I was in your arm  
My sweet Virginia  
I'm the same as I was in your arm  
  
Shame, shame go away, come again some other day  
Memories keep haunting me, help me chase them all away  
Hush, now, settle down, button up, don't make a sound  
Close your eyes, turn around, help me burn this to the ground  
Come now, take the blame, that's OK I'll play the game  
I don't care it's all the same, watch it all go up in flames  
Use me up, spit me out, let me be your hand-me-down  
Fame, fame, go away, come again some other day  
  
You used to say I couldn't save you enough  
So I've been savin' it up, I started savin' it up  
And when you said I couldn't give you enough  
I started givin' you up, I started givin' you up  
You are not me, Arlandria, Arlandria  
You and what army, Arlandria, Arlandria  
Oh God you gotta make it stop  
  
My sweet Virginia  
Oh God you gotta make it stop  
My sweet Virginia  
Oh God you gotta make it stop

You got a bad reputation.  
That's the word out on the town.  
It gives a certain fascination.  
But it can only bring you down.  
  
You better turn yourself around.  
Turn yourself around.  
Turn it upside down.  
Turn yourself around.  
  
You had bad breaks, well that's tough luck.  
You play too hard, too much rough stuff.  
You're too sly, and so cold.  
That bad reputation has made you old.  
  
Turn yourself around.  
Turn yourself around.  
Turn it upside down.  
Turn yourself around.  
  
(Guitar solo)  
  
You better turn yourself around.  
Turn yourself around.  
Turn it upside down.  
Turn yourself around

Winding you way down to baker street  
Light in your head and dead on your feet  
Well another crazy day  
You'll drink the night away  
And forget about everything  
  
This city's dance makes you feel so cold  
Its got so many people but its got no soul  
And its taken you so long  
To find out you were wrong  
When you thought it had everything  
  
You used to think that it was so easy  
You used to say that it was so easy  
But you're trying, you're trying now  
  
Another year and then you'll be happy  
Just one more year and then you'll be happy  
But you're crying you're crying now  
  
Way down the street there's a light in his place  
Opens the door  
He's got that look on his face  
And he asks you were you've been  
You tell him who you've seen  
And you talk about everything  
  
He's got this dream about buying some land  
He's gonna give up the crack and the one night stands  
And then he'll settle down  
In some quiet little town  
And forget about everything  
  
But you know he'll always keep moving  
You know he's never gonna stop moving  
'Cause he's rolling, he's the rolling stone  
  
When you wake up its a new morning  
The sun is shining its a new morning  
You're going, your going' home

When I talk about it  
It carries on  
Reasons only knew  
When I talk about it  
Aries or treasons  
All renew  
  
Big me to talk about it  
I could stand to prove  
If we can get around it  
I know that it's true  
  
When I talked about it  
Carried on  
Reasons only knew  
  
But it's you I fell into  
  
But it's you I fell into  
  
Well I talked about it  
Put it on  
Never was it true  
But it's you I fell into

Now when I was just a little boy standin' to my Daddy's knee  
My Poppa said, son, don't let the man get you, do what he done to me  
'Cause he'll get you, 'cause he'll get you now, now.  
  
I can remember the fourth of July, runnin' through the backwood bare.  
And I can still hear my old hound dog barkin', chasin' down a hoodoo there,  
Chasin' down a hoodoo there.  
  
Born on the bayou  
Born on the bayou  
Born on the bayou.  
  
Wish I was back on the bayou rollin' with some Cajun Queen.  
Wishin' I were a fast freight train, oh, just a-chooglin' on down to New
Orleans.  
  
Born on the bayou  
Born on the bayou  
Born on the bayou.  
  
I can remember the fourth of July, runnin' through the backwood bare.  
And I can still hear my old hound dog barkin', chasin' down a hoodoo there,  
Chasin' down a hoodoo there.  
  
Born on the bayou  
Born on the bayou  
Born on the bayou.

You make me dizzy  
Running circles in my head  
One of these days I'll chase you down  
Well look who's going crazy now  
We're face to face my friend  
Better get out  
Better get out  
  
You know you make me breakout  
Make me breakout  
  
I don't wanna look like that  
I don't wanna look like that  
  
You know you make me breakout  
Make me breakout  
  
I don't wanna look like that  
I don't wanna look like that  
Know you make me breakout  
  
You can see this on my face  
It's all for you  
The more and more I take I break right through  
Therapy still scares me  
Putting me on my back again  
I may be crazy, little frayed around the ends  
One of these days I'll phase you out  
  
Burn it in the blast off  
Burn it in the blast off  
Watch me crawl away  
Try to get out  
Try to get out  
  
You know you make me breakout  
Make me breakout  
  
I don't wanna look like that  
I don't wanna look like that  
  
You know you make me breakout  
Make me breakout  
  
I don't wanna look like that  
I don't wanna look like that  
I don't wanna look like that  
  
Breakout!  
Go, go, go  
  
You know you make me breakout  
Make me breakout  
  
I don't wanna look like that  
I don't wanna look like that  
Know you make me breakout

These are my famous last words  
My number's up bridges will burn  
Oh won't you let me twist your fate  
It's getting kinda late  
  
And I don't wanna wait no more  
Oh may I have this dance of days  
Locked in your embrace  
You passed your test of faith  
  
Another time, another place, another line upon your face  
Another in your wake  
Down crooked stairs and sideway glances comes the king of second chances  
Now throw him in the flames  
  
Whatever keeps you warm at night (whatever keeps you warm at night)  
Whatever keeps you warm inside  
Your bridges are burning now  
They're all coming down  
It's all coming 'round  
  
You're burning them down  
It's all coming 'round  
They're all coming down  
Your bridges are burning now  
  
Oh let me put you in your place  
Love it when you say, I'm giving everything away, but  
Tell me what's in it for me  
  
Tell me now what's in it for me  
No one's getting this for free  
So tell me now what's in it for me  
Whatever keeps you warm at night (whatever keeps you warm at night)  
  
Whatever keeps you warm inside  
Your bridges are burning now  
They're all coming down  
It's all coming 'round  
  
You're burning them down  
It's all coming 'round  
They're all coming down  
Your bridges are burning now  
  
Gathering the ashes  
Everything thrown away  
Gathering the ashes  
Scatter as they blow away  
  
Gathering the ashes  
Everything thrown away  
Gathering the ashes  
Scatter as they blow away  
  
Your bridges are burning now  
They're all coming down  
It's all coming 'round  
  
You're burning them down  
It's all coming 'round  
They're all coming down  
  
Your bridges are burning now  
They're all coming down  
It's all coming 'round  
  
You're burning them down  
It's all coming 'round  
They're all coming down  
Your bridges are burning now

Closing time, open all the doors  
And let you out into the world  
Closing time, turn all of the lights on  
Over every boy and every girl  
Closing time, one last call for alcohol  
So finish your whiskey or beer  
Closing time, you don't have to go home  
But you can't stay here  
  
I know who I want to take me home,  
I know who I want to take me home,  
I know who I want to take me home,  
Take me home  
  
Closing time, time for you to go out  
To the places you will be from  
Closing time, this room won't be open  
Till your brothers or your sisters come  
So gather up your jackets, move it to the exits  
I hope you have found a friend  
Closing time, every new beginning  
Comes from some other beginning's end  
  
I know who I want to take me home,  
I know who I want to take me home,  
I know who I want to take me home,  
Take me home  
  
Closing time, time for you to go out  
To the places you will be from  
  
I know who I want to take me home,  
I know who I want to take me home,  
I know who I want to take me home,  
Take me home  
  
Closing time, every new beginning  
Comes from some other beginning's end

Take a high dive in to your brain  
Made your only cause  
Just might wear your welcome out if you don't' let It go  
  
There's nothing that you couldn't say Cauze you Said it all before  
Think it's time you walked this lonely road all on Your own  
  
So it's your cold day in the sun  
Looks like your bleeding heart has already won  
  
I could take it away  
Save you from yourself  
You get so lost inside your head like no one else  
Looking for someone to blame  
Blame me all along  
You take the heat but you would never take the Fall  
  
It's your cold day in the sun  
Looks like your bleeding heart has already won  
  
You're so afraid that you are the only one  
But you are the only one you know  
Don't be afraid 'cause you're not the only one  
You're not the only one I know  
  
It's your cold day in the sun  
Looks like your bleeding heart has already won  
It's your cold day in the sun  
Looks like your bleeding heart has already won

Seems like only yesterday  
Life belonged to runaways  
Nothing here to see  
No looking back  
Every sound monotone  
Every color monochrome  
Light began to fade  
Into the black  
  
Such a simple animal  
Sterilized with alcohol  
I could hardly  
Feel me anymore  
  
Desperate and meaningless  
All filled up with emptiness  
Felt like everything  
Was said and done  
  
I lay there in the dark  
And I close my eyes  
You saved me the day  
You came alive  
  
Still I tried to find my way  
Spinning now was end of days  
Burning like a flame  
Behind my eyes  
  
Drown it out  
Drink it in  
Crown the king of suffering  
Prisoner, slave to the disguise  
  
Disappear the only thing  
Bittersweet surrendering  
Knew that it was time  
To say goodbye  
  
I lay there in the dark  
And I close my eyes  
You saved me the day  
You came alive  
No reason left  
Me to survive  
You saved me  
The day you came alive  
  
Come alive  
Come alive  
Come alive  
Come alive  
Come alive  
Come alive  
Come alive  
Come alive  
  
Come alive  
Come alive  
Come alive  
Come alive  
Come alive  
Come alive  
Come alive  
Come alive  
  
I lay there in the dark  
And I close my eyes  
You saved me the day  
You came alive  
  
Come alive  
Come alive  
Come alive  
Come alive  
Come alive  
Come alive  
Come alive  
Come alive  
Come alive  
Come alive  
Come alive  
Come alive  
Come alive  
Come alive  
Come alive  
  
Nothing wrong to give  
I can finally live  
Come alive  
You're laughing at me  
I can finally breathe  
Come alive  
  
Lay me down in the dark  
Open my eyes  
You saved me  
The day you came alive  
  
Come alive  
Come alive  
Come alive  
Come alive  
Come alive  
Come alive  
Come alive  
Come alive  
Come alive  
Come alive  
Come alive

Tie up the transmission  
This one is not a test  
Silent all these years  
But now I'm getting you off my chest  
Reeling in the moment,  
I know it will never last  
Tired of keepin' quiet,  
Riding with all the rest  
  
Stuck in the middle no-ones making a move  
I'm looking in and I've got nothing to lose  
  
I will comeback,  
I will comeback  
I will comeback,  
I will comeback  
I will comeback,  
I will comeback

For you  
  
Hide behind obsessions,  
I'm trying to keep in check  
Ride you for the finish  
We're coming??  
Reeling in the moment  
I know it will never last  
Rise up to the surface  
High but I'm sinking fast  
  
Stuck in the middle no-ones making a move  
I'm looking in and I've got nothing to lose  
  
I will comeback,  
I will comeback  
I will comeback,  
I will comeback  
I will comeback,  
I will comeback  
I will comeback,  
I will comeback for you  
  
Stuck in the middle no-ones making a move

Try Runnin around the candle  
I was only running into you  
Try Runnin around the candle  
I don't try to run it into you  
  
I get tired of runnin into you  
  
Damn you damn everyone  
I'll be fine without you  
Damn you damn everyone  
I'll be fine without you  
  
I'm still tired of runnin into you  
  
Try one that's with you  
Tear my damn heart in two  
I won't battle? At you  
Running into it! Running into it!

Dear lover  
Do you remember?  
The sound of your laughter and demise  
And that was all  
I need to fall in love  
  
This matter  
It's something bigger  
Anything ever graced my heart  
And that was all  
I could fall in love, with you  
And I can't stall this now  
  
Did you find some happiness with me?  
Now I know the way true love should be  
  
Dear lover  
Do you remember?  
The beats of my heart that I gave you  
And that was all  
I need to fall in love  
  
It shattered  
Slipped through my fingers  
Floated down safely into your hands  
And that was all  
I could fall in love, with you  
I can't stall this now  
  
Ooh Ooh Ooh  
  
Did you find some happiness with me?  
  
Yea yea yea  
Yea yea yea yea

You got away, got away, got away from me  
Now get away, get away, get away from me  
  
I couldn't grow just living in the shadow  
Where do you go when no one's following you?  
You ran away, ran away it was right on cue  
  
Shall I go on, and on, and on,  
And on, and on, and on again?  
  
Rosemary you're part of me  
You know you are, you are, you are  
Rosemary you're part of me  
You know you are, you are, you are  
Rosemary please pardon me  
  
Truth ain't gonna change the way you lie  
Youth ain't gonna change the way you die  
  
Dear Rosemary  
Dear Rosemary  
  
You've got a way, got a way, got a way with things  
You got away, got away, got away with things  
  
False starts, young hearts get shattered  
Pick up the pieces coming down around you  
You ran away, ran away, it was right on cue  
  
Can I go on, and on, and on,  
And on, and on, and on again?  
  
Rosemary you're part of me  
You know you are, you are, you are  
Rosemary you're part of me  
You know you are, you are, you are  
Rosemary please pardon me  
  
Truth ain't gonna change the way you lie  
Youth ain't gonna change the way you die  
  
This was no ordinary life  
(This was no ordinary life)  
This was no ordinary life  
(This was no ordinary life)  
  
I'm here from now on  
But once I'm gone  
I'm gone  
  
Truth ain't gonna change the way you lie  
Youth ain't gonna change the way you die  
  
Dear Rosemary (dear Rosemary)  
You're a part of me (you're part of me)  
Dear Rosemary (dear Rosemary)  
Please pardon me (please pardon me)  
Dear Rosemary  
  
You got away, got away, got away from me  
Now get away, get away, get away from me

Oh you know I did it  
It's over and I feel fine  
Nothing you could say is gonna change my mind  
Waiting and I wait at the longest night  
Nothing like the taste to sweet decline  
  
I was down, I fell, I fell so fast  
Dropping like the grains in an hourglass  
Never say forever cause nothing last  
Dancing with the thorns of my buried past  
  
Nevermind there's nothing I can do  
Bet your life there's something killing you  
  
It's a shame we have to die my dear  
No ones getting out of here, alive  
This time  
  
What a way to go, they have no fear  
No ones getting out of here, alive  
This time  
  
Finished, I'm getting you off my chest  
Made you come clean in a dirty dress  
A promise is a promise you kept in check  
Heart across a heart that beats it's best  
  
Take a good hard look for the very last time  
The very last one in a very long line  
Only took a second to say goodbye  
Then the pleasure 'bout the pleasure's  
Been mine, all mine  
  
Ain't no way, DOA  
Ain't no way, DOA  
  
It's a shame we have to disappear  
No ones getting out of here, alive  
  
This time  
This time  
This time

[Verse 1]  
Blast on near a wall  
Tell it or say  
Blast it  
Read a bow  
Wear it all away  
Empty handed  
Empty handed  
  
[Verse 2]  
Peel oh peel the rest  
Need a bit of salt  
Beg for it, son  
Nail it to a wall  
Empty handed  
Empty handed  
  
[Chorus 1](x2)  
It's never enough  
It's never enough  
It's never enough  
Yeah, you had another rule  
  
[Verse 1]  
  
[Verse 2]  
  
[Chorus](x4)  
  
Wow!

Have you been headwired?  
Were you satisfied?  
Did it free the feelings in your spine?  
Sleeping way inside all this time  
  
Will your meet your mind  
Where the night collides?  
Will you greet yourself  
When the sun arrives?  
  
I'll just stay behind  
I've met mine  
  
Better than a bullet being fired  
Tangled in your headwires now  
  
Help you feed the wires  
When your head unwinds?  
And if our headlines become entwined  
You can have all mine  
I'll be fine  
  
There's a reason why  
Keeping me alive  
There's a cure in me  
That I wish were mine  
As long as I can fight, I'll survive  
  
Better than a bullet being fired  
Tangled in your headwires now  
Better than a bullet being fired  
Tangled in your headwires now  
  
Stationed on the wire  
One day I'll let go  
Tell them all 'Hello'  
Tell them all 'Hello'  
  
The sun is on  
Arlandria  
  
Headwires

A heart of gold  
But it lost it's pride  
Beautiful veins  
And bloodshot eyes  
I see your face  
In another light  
  
[Chorus]  
Why'd you have to go  
And let it die  
Why'd you have to go  
And let it die  
Why'd you have to go  
And let it die  
In too deep  
And out of time  
Why'd you have to go  
And let it die  
  
A simple man  
And his blushing bride  
(Why'd you have to go)  
(And let it die)  
Intravenous  
Intertwined  
(Why'd you have to go)  
(And let it die)  
Hearts gone cold  
Your hands were tied  
(Why'd you have to go)  
(And let it die)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Do you ever think of me  
You're so considerate  
Did you ever think of me  
Oh so considerate  
  
In too deep  
And lost in time  
Why'd you have to go  
And let it die  
Beautiful veins  
And bloodshot eyes  
Why'd you have to go  
And let it die  
Hearts gone cold  
And hands are tied  
Why'd you have to go  
And let it die  
Why'd you have to go  
And let it die  
  
Do you ever think of me  
You're so considerate  
Did you ever think of me  
Oh so considerate  
  
In too deep  
And lost in time  
Why'd you have to go  
And let it die  
Beautiful veins  
And bloodshot eyes  
Why'd you have to go  
And let it die  
Hearts gone cold  
And hands are tied  
Why'd you have to go  
And let it die  
Why'd you have to go  
And let this die  
Why'd you have to go  
And let this die  
Why'd you have to go  
And let this die  
Why'd you have to go  
And let this die  
Why'd you have to go  
And let it die

Take your payroll  
And your lottery  
There's a place I know  
There's a robbery  
  
And I swear I'll never tell  
If you swear you'll never tell  
And we'll all make out so well  
We will all make out so well  
  
Head on with my hate  
Into the lights ahead  
I'm amazed that I'm still standing  
And I demand that we all blend in  
I'm amounted  
  
Just the same old  
Glitter story  
From the sea floor  
Metamorphosis  
And I can't change back for you  
I will not change back for you  
I must live in skin that's new  
I'm a livid skin that's new  
  
Head on with my hate  
Into the lights ahead  
I'm amazed that I'm still standing  
And I demand that we all blend in  
I'm amounted  
  
Turn your insides out to the outside  
Turn the outside in to the inside  
Trade your outside in for the inside  
Turn it around again  
Turn your insides out to the outside  
Turn the outside in to the inside  
Trade your outside in for the inside  
Turn it around again  
  
I'm amounted  
  
And I can't change back for you  
No I can't change back for you

What would I do?  
Lonely as you  
Pleasure or pain I can choose  
What would I do?  
Lonely as you  
  
Pleasure or pain I can choose  
  
Wake up your dream and I can't stand your screamin'  
Drowning out these prayers just some words without meanin'  
Spare all the preachin' my secret's worth keepin'  
No one understands like I do  
  
Keep out of reach I'm your leadin' deletion  
Hide behind these masks  
Though they still see right through them  
Every now and then  
You're down and out my friend  
Down and out again  
Down and out again  
Down and out again  
  
One more time for the last time  
One more time for release  
One more time for the last time  
Everyone wants to believe  
  
Blame it on you thought these years I've been losin'  
Blame it on the past it's the last place I knew you  
Blame all the children their rage and their ruin  
Blame it on the black and the blue  
Every now and then  
You're down and out my friend  
Down and out again  
Down and out again  
Down and out again  
I'm down with you  
  
One more time for the last time  
One more time for release  
One more time for the last time  
Everyone wants to believe  
  
Every now and then  
You're down and out my friend  
Down and out again  
Down and out again  
Down and out again  
But I'm done with you  
  
One more time for the last time  
One more time for release  
One more time for the last time  
Everyone wants to believe  
  
One more time for the last time  
One more time for release  
One more time for the last time  
Everyone wants to believe  
  
One more time for the last time  
One more time for release  
One more time for the very last time  
Everyone wants to believe  
All Right!

Hey now don't make a sound  
Say have you heard the news today?  
One flag was taken down  
To raise another in it's place  
  
A heavy cross you bear  
A stubborn heart remains unchanged  
No home, no life, no love  
No stranger singing in your name  
  
Maybe the season  
The colors change in the valley skies  
Dear God I've sealed my fate  
Running through hell  
Heaven can wait  
  
[Chorus]  
Long road to ruin  
There in your eyes  
Under the cold streetlights  
No tomorrow  
No dead-end in sight  
  
Let's say we take this town  
No king or queen of any state  
Get up to shut it down  
Open the streets and raise the gates  
  
I know a wall to scale  
I know a field without a name  
Head on without a care  
Before it's way too late  
  
Maybe the season  
The colors change in the valley skies  
Oh God I've sealed my fate  
Running through hell  
Heaven can wait  
  
Long road to ruin  
There in your eyes  
Under the cold streetlights  
No tomorrow  
No dead-ends  
  
[Chorus]  
  
For every piece to fall in place  
Forever gone without a trace  
Your horizon takes its shape  
No turning back, don't turn that page  
  
Come now, I'm leaving here tonight  
Come now, let's leave it all behind  
Is that the price you pay  
Running through hell  
Heaven can wait  
  
Long road to ruin  
There in your eyes  
Under the cold streetlights  
No tomorrow  
No dead ends  
  
Long road to ruin  
There in your eyes  
Under the cold streetlights  
No tomorrow  
No dead ends  
  
[Chorus]

You make me weep and wanna die  
Just when you said we'd try  
Lovin', touchin', squeezin' each other  
  
When I'm alone all by myself  
You're out with someone else  
Lovin', touchin', squeezin' each other  
  
You're tearin' me apart  
Every day, every day  
You're tearin' me apart  
Oh what can I say?  
You're tearin' me apart  
  
It won't be long, yes till you're alone  
When your lover, oh, he hasn't come home  
Cause he's lovin' oo, he's touchin',  
He's squeezin' another  
  
He's tearin' you apart  
Every day, every day  
He's tearin' you apart  
Oh girl what can you say?  
Cause he's lovin', touchin' another  
Now it's your turn, girl to cry  
Na na na na na na  
Na na na na na  
Na na na na na na  
Na na na na na

Hey you  
Are you in there  
I'm stuck outside you, ooh  
We could use  
One another  
Another like you, ooh  
  
You be my passerby  
I'll be your one to pass through  
Screws inside  
Turn so tight  
Turning on you  
I'm hanging on you, ooh  
  
Me and you  
Going nowhere  
I'm right beside you, ooh  
Me and you  
Going nowhere I'm right beside you, ooh  
  
You be my passerby  
I'll be your one to pass through  
Screws inside  
Turn so tight  
Turning on you  
I'm hanging on you  
  
Taking you as low as you go  
As low as you go  
Taking you as low as you go  
As low as you go  
Ooh, ooh, ooh  
  
You be my passerby  
I'll be your one to pass through  
Screws inside  
Turn so tight  
Turning on you  
I'm hanging on you  
  
Taking you as low as you go  
(Low as you go)  
As low as you go  
(Low as you go)  
Taking you as low as you go  
(Low as you go)  
As low as you go  
(Low as you go)  
As low as you go  
Low as you go  
Ooh, ooh  
  
Taking you as low as you go  
As low as you go  
Taking you as low as you go  
As low as you go  
Taking you as low as you go  
(Low as you go)  
As low as you go  
(Low as you go)  
Taking you as low as you go  
(Low as you go)  
As low as you go  
(Low as you go)

Call and I'll answer  
At home in the lost and found  
You say that I'm much too proud  
Someone who's taken pleasure  
In breaking down  
  
Never mind the mannequins  
Drunk in their hollow town  
Drinking their spoils down  
Cheap imitations  
A revelation is now  
  
Yeah, you won't find me  
I'm going M.I.A.  
Tonight I'm leaving  
Going M.I.A.  
Getting lost in you again  
Is better than being numb  
  
Counting every minute  
Till the feeling comes crashing down  
Run when it hits the ground  
I'm good at escaping,  
But better at flaking out  
  
Calling unanswered  
The center becomes blown out  
Stuck on the inside now  
It's fear I'm embracing  
I never could face you down  
  
Yeah, you won't find me  
I'm going M.I.A.  
Tonight I'm leaving  
Going M.I.A.  
Getting lost in you again  
Is better than being numb  
  
Red, red, laced around your head  
Cold and rescued  
  
Call and I'll answer  
At home in the lost and found  
You say that I'm much too proud  
Someone who's taken pleasure  
In breaking down  
  
Never mind the mannequins  
Drunk in their hollow town  
Drinking their spoils down  
Cheap imitations  
A revelation is now  
  
Yeah, you won't find me  
I'm going M.I.A.  
Tonight I'm leaving  
Going M.I.A.  
So you don't find me  
I'm going M.I.A.  
Tonight I'm leaving  
Going M.I.A.  
Say goodbye to me  
I'm going M.I.A.  
I can find relief  
I'm going M.I.A.  
Getting lost in you again  
Is better than being numb  
  
Better than playing dumb

If I share powdered milk with you  
I glue a picture to the chair  
Spit and butter from the plate that broke a week ago  
  
Gather Round'  
Gather Round'  
Gather Round'  
  
A father scolds his little boy  
For trading secrets with a girl  
He turns and kicks the neighbors dog into the other yard  
  
Gather Round'  
Gather Round'  
Gather Round'  
  
For Marys homeless people in the cardboard church  
Beneath the ramp fire is left for anyone to blame until.....  
  
Gather Round'  
Gather Round'  
Gather Round'

If I had my way  
If I had to lose  
Wouldn't take back one thing, never had much to choose  
Then it dawned on me  
Coming down on you  
Like a cold sky raining under a burning moon  
  
You've waited all your life  
Your wish is coming true  
Bless your heart for beating me right outta you  
  
Miss the misery  
Need a reason for a change  
Need a reason to explain  
So turn it on again  
Don't change your mind  
Your wasting light  
Get in and let's  
Go, go  
  
What a nice long leash  
What a nice tight noose  
Never worked for me but sure look good on you  
You've waited all your life  
Your wish is coming true  
Bless your heart for beating me right outta you  
  
Miss the misery  
Need a reason for a change  
Need a reason to refrain  
So turn it on again  
Don't change your mind  
Your wasting light  
Get in and let's  
Go, go!  
  
Miss the misery  
Gimme a reason for a change  
Miss the misery  
Gimme a reason to refrain  
Miss your misery in a day  
Miss your misery in a day  
Come on and turn it on for me  
  
Don't change your mind  
Your wasting light  
Don't make this right  
Don't make this right  
Get in and let's  
Go, go

What have we done with innocence?  
It disappeared with time, it never made much sense  
Adolescent resident  
Wasting another night on planning my revenge  
  
One in ten  
One in ten  
One in ten  
  
Don't wanna be your monkey wrench  
One more indecent accident  
I'd rather leave than suffer this  
I'll never be your monkey wrench  
All this time to make amends  
What do you do when all your enemies are friends?  
Now and then I'll try to bend  
Under pressure, wind up snapping in the end  
  
One in ten  
One in ten  
One in ten  
  
Don't wanna be your monkey wrench  
One more indecent accident  
I'd rather leave than suffer this  
I'll never be your monkey wrench  
Temper One last thing before I quit!  
I never wanted any more than I could fit into my head!  
I still remember every single word you said,  
And all the shit that somehow came along with it!  
Still, there's one thing that comforts me  
Since I was always caged and now I'm free  
Don't wanna be your monkey wrench  
One more indecent accident  
I'd rather leave than suffer this  
  
I'll never be your monkey wrench  
Don't wanna be your monkey wrench  
Don't wanna be your monkey wrench  
Don't wanna be your monkey wrench  
Don't wanna be your monkey wrench

Too alarmin' now to talk about  
Take your pictures down and shake it out  
Truth or consequence, say it aloud  
Use that evidence, race it around  
  
There goes my hero  
Watch him as he goes  
There goes my hero  
He's ordinary  
  
Don't the best of them bleed it out  
While the rest of them peter out?  
Truth or consequence, say it aloud  
Use that evidence, race it around  
  
There goes my hero  
Watch him as he goes  
There goes my hero  
He's ordinary  
  
Kudos, my hero, leavin' all the best  
You know my hero, the one that's on  
There goes my hero  
Watch him as he goes  
There goes my hero  
He's ordinary  
There goes my hero  
Watch him as he goes  
There goes my hero  
He's ordinary

Real life is so hard  
We hide in the stars  
That's where our heads are  
My head and your heart  
  
This is a blackout  
Don't let it go to waste  
This is a blackout  
I want to detonate  
  
When you are so far  
I'm falling part  
Lose all my sonar  
You jam my radar  
  
This is a blackout  
Don't let it go to waste  
This is a blackout  
I want to detonate  
  
Sometimes I feel I'm getting stuck  
Between the handshake and the fuck  
You've got me on guard  
I've got my head start  
My head and your heart  
The same in the stars  
  
This is a blackout  
Don't let it go to waste  
This is a blackout  
I want to detonate  
  
Sometimes I feel I'm getting stuck  
Between the handshake and the fuck  
Brain, brain, brain, brain  
Okay

There are things that I'd like to say  
But I'm never talking to you again  
There's things I'd like to phrase some way  
But I'm never talking to you again  
  
I'm never talking to you again  
I'm never talking to you  
I'm tired of wasting all my time  
Trying to talk to you  
  
I'd put you down where you belong  
But I'm never talking to you again  
I'd show you everywhere you're wrong  
But I'm never talking to you again

Lately, I've been  
Livin' in my head  
The rest of me is dead,  
I'm dying for truth.  
  
Make me, believe,  
No more left and right,  
Come on take my side,  
I'm fightin' for you,  
I'm fightin' for you.  
  
Pleased to meet you take my hand,  
There is no way back from here,  
Pleased to meet you say your prayers,  
There is no way back from here,  
But I don't care,  
No way back from here  
  
Wake me, I'm ready,  
Somethin' don't seem right,  
I was dreamin' and  
I was talkin' to you,  
  
Memory, mend me,  
Know I've seen my share,  
Things I can't repair,  
I'm breakin' to you,  
I'm breakin' to you.  
  
Pleased to meet you take my hand,  
There is no way back from here,  
Pleased to meet you say your prayers,  
There is no way back from here,  
But I don't care,  
No way back from, here.  
  
Pleased to meet you say your prayers,  
There is no way back from here,  
Pleased to meet you say your prayers,  
There is no way back from here,  
But I don't care,  
No way back from, here.

The waves that silences break come again,  
One by one  
I lay awake and I count til I drown  
Turn off the room, it's getting too loud,  
I know I don't have to say it,  
Pick up and move and go find some new ground,  
Somewhere I know I can make it  
  
But I won't give up,  
When I want it enough,  
No I won't give up,  
Anything, anyway, anyone, anyday  
'Cause I've figured it out,  
Here and the now,  
Takes me day by day  
  
Hey, will you come out tonight?  
Will you back down will you put up a fight?  
Turn me around and make eveything right,  
Make me normal, from now on  
  
Erased every one I've replaced  
In the end, they're all gone,  
The faces all fade as the time passes by  
What could I do I was waiting for you,  
Grown sick and tired of faking,  
Give me those eyes when I give you the truth,  
Finally here for the taking  
  
But I won't give up,  
When I want it enough,  
No I won't give up,  
Anything, anyway, anyone, anyday  
Cause I've figured it out,  
Here and the now,  
Takes me day by day  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
Hey, will you come out tonight?  
Will you back down will you put up a fight?  
Turn me around and make eveything right,  
Make me normal, from now on  
  
Figured it out,  
Here and the now,  
Takes me day by day  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
Hey, will you come out tonight?  
Will you back down will you put up a fight?  
Turn me around and make everything right,  
Make me normal, from now on  
  
Make me normal, from now on  
Make me normal, from now on  
Make me normal, from now on

One more day that I've survived  
Another night alone  
Pay no mind I'm doing fine  
I'm breathing on my own  
  
I'm here  
And I'm on the mend  
I'm here  
And I'm on the mend my friend  
  
Wake me when the hour arrives  
Wake me with my name  
See you somewhere down the line  
We're tethered once again  
  
I'm here  
And I'm on the mend  
I'm here  
And I'm on the mend my friend  
  
I'm here  
And I'm on the mend  
I'm here  
And I'm on the mend my friend  
  
Was it you?  
Sat alone  
Here we go  
  
Close and stay a while  
To take me where you go  
Single file we walk the mile  
Who's wandering back home  
  
I'm here  
And I'm on the mend  
I'm here  
And I'm on the mend my friend  
  
I'm here  
And I'm on the mend  
I'm here  
And I'm on the mend my friend  
  
Was it you?  
Sat alone  
Here we go  
Here we go  
Here we go  
Here we go

Restless little one  
Comfortable and warm  
Let me fall apart  
Crippled in your arms  
  
Chase me through the dark  
Ready on your mark  
First to reach the stars  
Wins a broken heart  
One that broke apart  
Shattered from the start  
  
Are you there?  
Do you read me?  
Are you there?  
I don't feel you anymore  
  
Cages and alarms  
Keeping us from harm  
I will be the guard  
Hope to rest upon  
  
Could I be the one  
To break a will so strong  
Pray it won't be long  
Til your will is gone  
Everything is done  
Nothing left at all  
  
Are you there?  
Do you read me?  
Are you there?  
I don't feel you anymore  
  
Are you there?  
Will you give in?  
Are you there?  
If I give out  
Over and out  
  
Cages and alarms  
Keeping us from harm  
I will be the guard  
Hope to rest upon  
Everything is done  
Nothing left at all  
  
Are you there?  
Do you read me?  
Are you there?  
I don't feel you anymore  
  
Are you there?  
Will you give in?  
Are you there?  
If I give out

Every now I'm running out  
This time I think I'm breaking up  
Come on down, we'll take this town  
Tonight before it turns to dust  
  
You change and then  
You change again  
Turning like the wheels inside your head  
  
Every now I'm drifting out  
This time it keeps on sinking us  
Come on down, we'll take this town  
Tonight before it turns to dust  
  
You change and then  
You change again  
Turning like the wheels inside your head  
  
Overdrive, I'm going life or death  
Overdrive, I'm going life or death  
Overdrive, I'm going life or death  
Keep hanging by a thread  
  
There's a lie, I think you'll find  
It's locked inside of everyone  
You and I get on with life  
Pray we'll find a better one  
  
You change and then  
You change again  
Turning like the wheels inside your head  
  
Overdrive, I'm going life or death  
Overdrive, I'm going life or death  
Overdrive, I'm going life or death  
Keep hanging by a thread  
  
You change and then  
You change again  
Turning like the wheels inside your head  
  
Every now I'm drifting out  
This time I think it's sinking us  
Come on down, we'll take this town  
Tonight before it turns to dust  
  
You change and then  
You change again  
Turning like the wheels inside your head  
  
Overdrive, I'm going life or death  
Overdrive, I'm going life or death  
Overdrive, I'm going life or death  
Keep hanging  
Keep hanging  
You keep hanging  
By a thread

Shut your mouth for the winter  
If your boyfriend listens  
Were building a relation  
For the music shakes it  
  
There's that song again  
There's that song again  
There's that song again  
There's that song again...  
  
How come I could not cheat  
If you're a colorful lover  
I don't mind being one of them  
I don't mind my, big deal  
  
It's been thrown away again  
It's been thrown away again  
It's been thrown away again  
It's been thrown away again...

Wake up it's time  
We need to find a better place to hide  
Make up your mind  
I need to know I need to know tonight  
  
Sweet and divine  
Razor of mine  
Sweet and divine  
Razor blade shine  
  
Patience my dear  
We could spend a lifetime waiting here  
Maybe this time  
I hope I get the chance to say goodbye  
  
Sweet and divine  
Razor of mine  
Sweet and divine  
Razor of mine  
  
Day after day  
Cutting away  
Day after day  
But anyway  
  
Wake up it's time  
We need to find a better place to hide  
Make up your mind  
I need to know I need to know tonight  
  
Sweet and divine  
Razor blade shine

Something that I felt today, something that I had  
Swingin' from the chandoleres, hanging on your word  
I remember watchin' you once upon a time  
Dancing from across the room in another life  
  
A little bit of resolve is what I need now  
Pin me down, show me how  
A little bit of resolve is what I need now  
Pin me down, show me how  
  
Lookin' back to find my way, never sing so hard  
Yesterday's belated rest, changing of the gods  
I would never change a thing even if I could  
All the songs we used to sing, everything was gone  
  
A little bit of resolve is what I need now  
Pin me down, show me how  
A little bit of resolve is what I need now  
Pin me down, show me how  
  
One more Louvre that you're not here  
It's gone and passed you by  
Happened to you, happened to you  
One more tear that you won't hear  
That's gone and passed you by  
Happened to you, happened to you  
  
A little bit of resolve is what I need now  
Pin me down, show me how  
A little bit of resolve is what I need now  
Pin me down, show me how  
  
A little bit of resolve  
One more Louvre that you're not here  
It's gone and passed you by (A little bit of resolve)  
A little bit of resolve  
One more Louvre that you're not here  
It's gone and passed you by (A little bit of resolve)

This indecision got me climbing up the wall  
Been cheating gravity and waiting on the fall  
How did this come over me, I thought I was above it all  
Our hopes gone up in smoke, swallow your crown  
  
Choke, on a kiss, I thought I'd save my breath for you  
Choke, on a kiss, I thought I'd save my breath for you  
  
Give me some rope I'm coming loose, I'm hanging on you  
Give me some rope I'm coming loose, I'm pulling for you now  
Give me some rope I'm coming, out of my head, into the clear when you, go,  
I, go, no  
  
These premonitions got me crying up a storm  
Leave your condition, this position does no harm  
  
Choke, on a kiss, I thought I'd save my breath for you  
Choke, on a kiss, I thought I'd save my breath for you  
  
Give me some rope I'm coming loose, I'm hanging on you  
Give me some rope I'm coming loose, I'm pulling for you now  
Give me some rope I'm coming, out of my head, into the clear when you, go,  
I, go, noose  
  
Give me some rope I'm coming loose, I'm hanging on you  
Give me some rope I'm coming loose, I'm pulling for you now  
Give me some rope I'm coming through, I'm coming out, yeah  
Give me some rope, I'm coming out of my head, into the clear when you go,  
I go, go

One of these Nights I'll shake you  
I will take you from my veins  
I'm gettin' tired of waiting  
It's time to empty me  
  
Chorus:  
We can rip apart this bleeding heart, don't you wanna watch me spill?  
Bleed you out again  
  
Feeling me reach inside you  
And I feel you run through me  
Funny how you remind me  
I got memories to drain  
  
Chorus X2  
  
Bleed me slowly until every vein is empty just like you  
Bleed me slowly until every vein is empty just like you  
Please oh, please oh, you're draining me  
I've got to bleed myself of you  
Please oh, please oh, you're draining me  
I've got to bleed, I've got to bleed for you  
  
Chorus X2

Oh mirror mirror  
You're coming in clear  
I'm finally somewhere in between  
I'm impressed  
What a beautiful chest  
I never meant to make a big scene  
  
Will you resign to the latest design  
You look so messy when you dress up in dreams  
One more for hire  
Or wonderful liar?  
I think its time we all should come clean  
  
Stack dead actors  
Stacked to the rafters  
Line up the bastards  
All I want is the truth  
  
Hey hey now, can you fake it?  
Can you make it look like we want?  
Hey hey now, can you take it?  
And we cry when they all die blond?  
  
God bless, what a sensitive mess  
Yeah but things aren't always what they seem  
Your teary eyes  
Your famous disguise  
Never knowing who to believe  
  
See through  
Yeah, but what do you do?  
When you're just another aging drag queen?  
  
Stack dead actors  
Stacked to the rafters  
Line up the bastards  
All I want is the truth  
  
Hey hey now, can you fake it?  
Can you make it look like we want?  
Hey hey now, can you take it?  
And we cry when they all die blond?

You and I were two old and tortured souls  
Repaired by a love of broken things  
In a life, just some bodies growing old  
No fear of the end, of anything  
  
We're just ordinary people, you and me  
Time will turn us into statues, eventually  
  
We got by, though we never needed much  
A sliver of hope, no diamond rings  
We got high, it was heaven it was hell  
Flying over them, with broken wings  
  
[Chorus]  
We're just ordinary people, you and me  
Time will turn us into statues, eventually  
Oh, just two ordinary people, you and me  
Time will turn us into statues, eventually  
  
Our bones forever in stone  
Monuments of life  
To dust, as everything must  
We fade away in time, oh  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Just two ordinary people you and me  
Time will turn us into statues eventually

If you'd like to walk a while  
We could waste the day  
Follow me into the trees  
I will lead the way  
  
Bring some change up to the bridge  
Bring some alcohol  
There we'll make a final wish  
Just before the fall  
  
Promise I will be forever yours  
Promise not to say another word  
Never mind what's done is done  
Always was a lucky one  
  
Watch the sunrise all alone  
Sitting on the tracks  
Hear the train come roaring in  
Never coming back  
  
Laying quiet in the grass  
Everything is still  
River stones and broken bones  
Scattered on the hill  
  
Promise I will be forever yours  
Promise not to say another word  
Never mind what's done is done  
Always was a lucky one  
  
Promise I will be forever yours  
Promise not to say another word  
Here forever deep beneath the dirt  
Never mind what's done is done  
Always was a lucky one

Early morning without warning  
Woke me with a scare  
I had that dream again  
That the sun was dead  
Make me warm or take me home  
It's so cold in here  
Can't we meet somewhere  
Is it winter there?  
Is it winter there?  
This winter  
  
[Chorus]  
Meet me in the summer time  
We can move the air  
Sweet Virginia countryside  
I will meet you there  
Bloody lips and cherry wine  
Moonshine in your hair  
Just keep staring at the sun  
Pray for summer's end  
  
Come on over brave my storm  
Ocean's overhead  
Come inside my friend  
Getting bad out there  
Every moment we have stolen  
All we had to share  
No one wanted this  
But you know I did  
You know I did  
This moment  
  
[Chorus: x2]

You're a real short ride, wow right  
It'll beat you's up anyway, that's right  
You're a teachers pet, wow right  
Sit and bleach one anyway, that's why  
  
Color and the shape  
Color and the shape  
  
No sweat yeah, wow right  
You're a retard anyway, that's right  
Stand to beat your ass away, wow right  
Instead a river boy runs away, that's right  
  
Shape  
  
You're a retard anyway, that's right  
That is beat your hands away, wow right  
Sell me river boy run away, that's why

Shame on you  
Seducing everyone  
Faded you  
Your diamond in the rough  
  
You don't have to tell me  
I know where you've been  
Shinning once again  
  
Will you do  
The thing you've always done  
Tell me true  
I think you know the one  
  
One that makes me blurry  
Colors start to run  
  
Every time I wonder  
I go under  
  
The deeper the blues  
The more I see black  
Sweeter the brew the feeling starts coming back  
All the deepest blues are black

That night they were burning for truth  
Down on the corner of 14th and u  
They took your soul and they took you for fools  
Took all the windows from prisons and schools  
Now what's a poor man left to do?  
  
One heart now broken in two  
You start untying the answer of the youth  
New kids hear the sound of the drumming  
Mother nature your summer is coming  
Yesterday and today revolution on it's way  
  
Amen  
It was the feast and the famine  
Amen  
It was the feast and the famine  
It was the feast and the famine  
Feast and the famine  
  
Crossroads with nothing to lose  
Out of the basement and into the news  
Come change now shit getting heavy  
Salvation at the ready  
You look when I walk by  
Still screaming till I die  
  
Can't find peace if you can't find a home  
You can't survive as an island alone  
Black heart with a gaping wound  
Put back together by a troubled groove  
Check yourself wreck your brains  
Where is that BMA  
  
Amen  
It was the feast and the famine  
Amen  
It was the feast and the famine  
It was the feast and the famine  
Feast and the famine  
  
Hey  
Where is the monument  
To the dreams we forget?  
We need a monument  
And a change will come  
Yeah change will come  
Is there anybody there?  
Anybody there?  
  
Amen  
It was the feast and the famine  
Amen  
It was the feast and the famine  
It was the feast and the famine  
Feast and the famine  
  
Amen  
Where is the monument  
To the dreams we forget?  
We need a monument  
And a change will come  
And change will come  
Is there anybody there?  
Anybody there?

This is the sound  
The here and the now  
You got to talk the talk, the talk, the talk  
To get it all out  
  
I listen  
I listen  
I listen  
  
But you're out of tune  
You're so out of tune  
  
This is the last song (This is the last song)  
This is the last song  
That I will dedicate to you  
  
Something I've found  
Yea, That want to turn around  
You got to walk the walk, the walk, the walk  
To make any ground  
  
You're pushing  
You're pushing  
You're pushing  
  
But there ain't no room  
No there ain't no room  
  
This is the last song (This is the last song)  
This is the last song (This is the last song)  
That I will dedicate to you  
I made my peace  
And now I'm trough  
This is the last song  
That I will dedicate to you  
  
And yours is a name  
I will never name again  
I will never name again  
  
We pretend it doesn't matter  
We pretend it all away  
We pretend it all away  
  
We pretend  
We pretend  
We pretend  
  
But it ain't no use  
This is the last song (This is the last song)  
This is the last song (This is the last song)  
That I will dedicate to you  
I made my peace  
And now I'm through  
  
This is the last song  
That I will dedicate to you  
To you  
To you  
To you

Everyone makes one mistake  
One more time for old times sake  
One more time before the feeling fades  
  
One that's born of memories  
One more bruise you gave to me  
One more test just how much can I take  
  
Because you're not the one but you're the only one  
Who can make me feel like this  
You're not the one but you're the only one  
Who can make me feel like shit  
  
Something never meant to be  
Everything you meant to me  
Wake me when this punishment is done  
  
Those who try and get away  
From the one who gets away  
Someone's always someone else's one  
  
Because you're not the one but you're the only one  
Who can make me feel like this  
You're not the one but you're the only one  
Who can make me feel like shit  
You're not the one but you're the only one  
Who can make me feel like this  
You're not the one but you're the only one  
Who can make me feel like shit  
  
Until the end of time  
In another life  
Until the day I die  
Save it up for one more try  
Save it for the last goodbye  
We go on and get off  
And get on and get off  
  
Because you're not the one but you're the only one  
Who can make me feel like this  
You're not the one but you're the only one  
Who can make me feel like shit  
You're not the one but you're the only one  
Who can make me feel like this  
You're not the one but you're the only one  
Who can make me feel like shit  
  
Because you're not the one but you're the only one  
Who can make me feel like this  
You're not the one but you're the only one  
Who can make me feel like  
Oh shit

Keep you in the dark  
You know they all pretend  
Keep you in the dark  
And so it all began  
  
Send in your skeletons  
Sing as their bones go marching in, again  
The need you buried deep  
The secrets that you keep are ever ready  
Are you ready?  
I'm finished making sense  
Done pleading ignorance  
That whole defense  
  
Spinning infinity, boy  
The wheel is spinning me  
It's never-ending, never-ending  
Same old story  
  
What if I say I'm not like the others?  
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?  
You're the pretender  
What if I say I will never surrender?  
What if I say I'm not like the others?  
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?  
You're the pretender  
What if I say that I'll never surrender?  
  
In time our soul untold  
I'm just another soul for sale, oh well  
The page is out of print  
We are not permanent  
We're temporary, temporary  
Same old story  
  
What if I say I'm not like the others?  
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?  
You're the pretender  
What if I say that I'll never surrender?  
What if I say I'm not like the others?  
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?  
You're the pretender  
What if I say that I'll never surrender?  
  
I'm the voice inside your head  
You refuse to hear  
I'm the face that you have to face  
Mirrored in your stare  
I'm what's left, I'm what's right  
I'm the enemy  
I'm the hand that will take you down  
Bring you to your knees  
  
So who are you?  
Yeah, who are you?  
Yeah, who are you?  
Yeah, who are you?  
  
Keep you in the dark  
You know they all pretend  
  
What if I say I'm not like the others?  
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?  
You're the pretender  
What if I say I will never surrender?  
What if I say I'm not like the others?  
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?  
You're the pretender  
What if I say that I'll never surrender?  
  
What if I say I'm not like the others?  
(Keep you in the dark)  
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?  
(You know they all pretend)  
You're the pretender  
(Who dares)  
What if I say I will never surrender?  
  
What if I say I'm not like the others?  
(Keep you in the dark)  
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?  
(You know they all pretend)  
You're the pretender  
(Who dares)  
What if I say I will never surrender?  
  
So who are you?  
Yeah, who are you?  
Yeah, who are you?

One of these days, the ground will drop out from beneath your feet  
One of these days, your heart will stop and play it's final beat  
  
One of these days, the clocks will stop and time won't mean a thing  
One of these days, their bombs will drop and silence everything  
  
But it's alright, yeah it's alright, said it's alright

The rain is here, and you, my dear, are still my friend  
It's true two of us are back as one again  
I was the one who left you  
Always coming back  
I cannot forget you, girl  
Now I am up in arms again  
  
The rain is here, and you, my dear, are still my friend

Always coming back  
I cannot forget you, girl  
Now I am up in arms again  
  
Together now, I don't know how this love could end  
My lonely heart, it falls apart for you to mend  
I was the one who left you  
  
Always coming back I cannot forget you, girl  
Now I am up in arms again

Always coming back I cannot forget you, girl  
Now I am up in arms again

Dearest constellation, heaven surroundin' you  
Stay there, soft and blue.  
Virginia Moon, I'll wait for you tonight  
Sweetest invitation, breaking the day in two  
Feelin' like I do, Virginia moon, I'll wait for you tonight  
  
And now our shades become shadows in your light  
In the morning wind we're through and tomorrow rescues you,  
I will say goodnight  
  
Secret fascination, whisper a quiet tune  
Hear me callin' you, Virginia moon, I'll wait for you tonight  
  
And now our shapes become shadows in your light  
In the morning when we're through and tomorrow rescues you,  
I will say goodnight  
  
Virginia Moon, I'll wait for you tonight  
  
And now our shapes become shadows in your light  
In the morning when we're through and tomorrow rescues you,  
I will say goodnight  
  
I will say goodnight  
I will say goodnight

A million miles away  
Your signal in the distance  
To whom it may concern  
I think I lost my way  
Getting good at starting over  
Every time that I return  
  
Learning to walk again  
I believe I've waited long enough  
Where do I begin?  
Learning to talk again  
Can't you see I've waited long enough?  
Where do I begin?  
  
Do you remember the days?  
We built these paper mountains  
Then sat and watched them burn  
I think I found my place  
Can't you feel it growing stronger  
Little conquerors  
  
Learning to walk again  
I believe I've waited long enough  
Where do I begin?  
Learning to talk again  
I believe I've waited long enough  
Where do I begin?  
  
Now,  
For the very first time  
Don't you pay no mind  
Set me free, again  
To keep alive, a moment at a time  
That's still inside, a whisper to a riot  
The sacrifice, the knowing to survive  
The first decline, another state of mind  
I'm on my knees, I'm praying for a sign  
Forever, whenever, I never wanna die  
  
I never wanna die  
I never wanna die  
I'm on my knees, I never wanna die  
I'm dancing on my grave  
I'm running through the fire  
Forever, whenever  
I never wanna die  
I never wanna leave  
I'll never say goodbye  
Forever, whenever  
Forever, whenever  
  
Learning to walk again  
I believe I've waited long enough  
Where do I begin?  
Learning to talk again  
Can't you see I've waited long enough?  
Where do I begin?  
  
Learning to walk again  
I believe I've waited long enough  
Learning to talk again  
Can't you see I've waited long enough?

Got my good side at the ready  
If the other one is on the mend  
Feel it in my bones when you break my back  
Break it just to watch me bend  
Anyway for once you admit it  
No matter what your good book says  
Never lookin' back 'cause I ain't no saint  
Just another teenage head  
  
You gotta, wait for the feeling and you wait for the feeling  
And you wait, and you shiver and you shake  
Crawlin' back and forth from the black and white  
  
Over and over again  
Over and over and over again  
Ain't no turning back cause I'm walkin' a line,  
Walkin' a line, walkin' a line  
For you  
  
Maybe if you swear you'll save me  
Maybe save myself instead  
Swear across my heart and I hope to die  
Maybe we could just play dead  
Runnin' out of time but I'm ready  
Run out when I run this red  
See you on the chase, I will track you down  
Even though you're miles ahead  
  
You gotta, wait for the feeling and you wait for the feeling  
And you wait, and you shiver and you shake  
Crawlin' back and forth from the black and white  
  
Over and over again  
Over and over and over again  
Ain't no turning back no there ain't no turning back,  
No there ain't no turning back, no there ain't no turning back  
Ain't no turning back 'cause I'm walkin' a line  
Walkin' a line for you

Tonight I'm tangled in my blanket of clouds  
Dreaming aloud  
  
Things just won't do without you, matter of fact  
Oh oh ooh  
I'm on your back  
I'm on your back  
Oh oh ooh  
I'm on your back  
  
If you'd accept surrender, I'll give up some more  
Weren't you adored  
  
I cannot be without you, matter of fact  
Oh oh ooh  
I'm on your back  
  
If you walk out on me  
I'm walking after you  
If you walk out on me  
I'm walking after you  
  
Another heart is cracked in two  
I'm on your back  
  
I cannot be without you, matter of fact  
Oh oh ooh  
I'm on your back  
I'm on your back  
Oh oh ooh  
I'm on your back  
  
If you walk out on me  
I'm walking after you  
If you walk out on me  
I'm walking after you  
If you walk out on me  
I'm walking after you

Stick it to the mailman  
Reading is a problem  
See you all suntanned  
Only with the ray bans  
  
Take that to the man you call the chair  
Pissing on a wet wall  
  
Skinny yellow spit, man  
Dealin' with the shit, man  
Make it with my bad hand  
Just another rock band  
  
Take that to the man they call the chair  
Trouble with the contract  
  
Hey there, boy, you been catchin' the black widow  
That's what we want you to know  
  
I want to swim in a watershed  
I want to listen to crawdads  
I lost the counter so bad  
I keep on thinking I get ahead, I'm  
  
Pissin' on the disc jam  
Pissin' 'bout the farm hand  
Pissin' 'bout the Greek state  
Miss it and I can't wait  
  
Take that to the man they call the chair  
Trouble with the contract  
  
Hey, man, can't you tell  
It's still a problem?  
  
I want to swim in a wattershed  
I want to listen to crawdads  
I lost the counter so bad  
I keep on thinking I get ahead, I'm  
  
Pissin' on the disc jam  
Pissin' 'bout the farm hand  
Pissin' 'bout the greek state

I'm molasses hung in rent  
Read a sponsor one shot no post-show  
Tear it off, but not a lot, it's not enough to debate  
As if you blame real and stagnate  
Big shit no shit  
  
Tear it off, but not a lot, only so much you can take  
Some try that hit beast and mud lead  
Big shit no shit  
  
Tear it off, but not a lot, only so much you can take  
Tear it off, but not a lot, it's not enough to debate  
Big shit no duh  
  
Right?  
One shot nothing

Back and forth that voice of yours keeps me up at night  
Help me search to find the words that eat you up inside  
I go side to side like the wildest tides in your hurricane  
And I only hide what is on my mind because I can't explain  
  
What if I do love  
What if I don't?  
I'd have to lose everything just to find you  
What if I do love  
What if I don't  
I'd have to lose everything just to find you  
  
It's my turn this solo burn so throw me in the fire  
Trophies earned and lessons learned, my wicked little lies  
We can pave new roads with the cold creed stones, wind them through the pines  
Should I stay or should I go alone? I cannot decide  
  
What if I do love  
What if I don't?  
I'd have to lose everything just to find you  
What if I do love  
What if I don't  
I'd have to lose everything just to find you  
  
Carolina, Caroline  
Carolina, Caroline  
  
What if I do love  
What if I don't?  
I'd have to lose everything just to find you  
What if I do love  
What if I don't  
I'd have to lose everything just to find you  
  
Carolina, Caroline  
Carolina, Caroline  
Carolina, Caroline  
Carolina, Caroline

I know what you're thinkin'  
We were goin' down  
I can feel the sinkin'  
But then I came around  
  
And everyone I've loved before  
Flashed before my eyes  
And nothin' mattered anymore  
I looked into the sky  
  
Well we all want something better than  
We wish for something new  
Well we all want something beautiful  
Wish for something true  
Been lookin' for a reason and  
Something to lose  
  
When the wheels come down  
When the wheels touch ground  
And you feel like it's all over  
There's another round for you  
When the wheels come down (When the wheels come down)  
  
Now your head is spinnin'  
Broken hearts will mend  
This is our beginning  
Comin' to an end  
  
Well, you wanted something beautiful  
You wished for something new  
Well, you wanted something better than  
Wished for something true  
Been lookin' for a reason and  
Something to lose  
  
When the wheels come down (When the wheels come down)  
When the wheels touch ground (When the wheels touch ground)  
And you feel like it's all over  
There's another round for you  
When the wheels come down (When the wheels come down)  
Oh!  
  
When the wheels come down (When the wheels come down)  
When the wheels touch ground (When the wheels touch ground)  
And you feel like it's all over  
There's another round for you  
When the wheels come down (When the wheels come down)  
  
When the wheels come down (When the wheels come down)  
When the wheels touch ground (When the wheels touch ground)  
And you feel like it's all over  
There's another round for you  
When the wheels come down (When the wheels come down)

Goodbye Jimmy, farewell youth  
Must be on my way I have had enough of you.  
Was a young man proud and true  
Just a simple boy with nothing else to lose  
Years that I've wasted these I owe you's  
They're just fucking words  
This is life or death  
It's time to clear the air you better save your breath  
Say have you heard  
Say have you heard  
The poison in my heart and the voices in my head  
Years that I've waited these I owe you's  
I meant every word for word for word forward.  
Word for word for word forward.  
Word for word for word forward.  
Word for word for word forward.  
But it's only words  
I meant every word  
They're just fucking words  
Word for word for word forward.  
Word for word for word forward.  
Word for word for word forward.  
Word for word for word forward.  
Word for word for word forward.

Leading everything along  
Never far from being wrong  
Never mind these things at all  
It's nothing  
  
Couldn't find a way to you  
Seems that's all I ever do  
Turning up in black and blue  
Rewarded  
  
All the static we all left  
  
Wait until the time has come  
Figure that's where time comes from  
Leaving all my senses numb  
Is heaven  
  
Lifted up the fay to seen  
Anything could never be  
Anything but play to me  
In order  
  
Take it back for them to keep  
Fallen into something deep  
Not that I had made that leap  
Anointed  
  
Where have all the wishes gone  
Now that all of that is done  
Wish I would've felt I've won  
For once
