Listen girl you want me but he needs you  
Yet you're tellin' me that everything is cool  
Tryin' to convince me baby to do as you say  
Just go along and see things your way  
  
CHORUS  
And keep it on the down low  
Nobody has to know  
We can keep it on the down low  
Nobody has to know  
  
Secret lovers is what you wanna be  
While making love to him girl you're silently calling on me  
What is a man to do in a situation like this?  
I feel there is something that I don't wanna miss  
  
CHORUS 2x  
  
Beautiful you are but you're his by far  
Comin' by my way drivin' his fancy car  
Making plans to be in my life forever  
Tell me, tell me that we'll always be together  
  
CHORUS 2x  
  
Listen babe I won't whisper a word

Got to have you back I need you  
A jealous lie hurt my foolish pride  
Made me break your heart  
Now our love has died  
I see a closing door - a door never more  
A door of jealousy between your love and me  
Now I face a storm of tears  
You took the sunshine from my face  
Now I'm just another man  
Who walks the undestined way  
Without your guiding hand  
I can hardly tell when I'm the man  
Pride made a fool of me  
Now I'm drowning in misery - misery is drowning me  
  
And I've got to have you back I need you  
Between the night and day oh heaven speed you  
Cos I need you girl  
I've been told - it's a loneliness  
Oh dark is the emptiness  
Since you've been gone in me  
Oh gone is the lover I need  
Pride destroyed the love we knew  
But not my need for you  
Without your love around  
My whole world is falling down - falling down - all around  
And I've got to have you back  
  
Got to have you back  
Got to have you back  
Got to have you back  
Got to have you back  
  
I see a closing door...  
  
Got to have you back - I'm drowning in misery  
Got to have you back - my pride made a fool of me  
Got to have you back - my whole world is falling down  
Got to have you back - without your sweet love around  
  
Got to have you back

Oh, I've been thinking of you  
And you've been thinking of me.  
Oh, I'll give all that I have  
If you'll give all that I need.  
And oh, oh, oh, lets be fair.  
And I think its time we cleared the air.  
I've been watching you, you've been watching me.  
You know I've been wantin to groove with you.  
Girl, speak your mind.  
Groove with you.  
You been thinking all of this time.  
Groove with you.  
Aw baby what I wouldn't do.  
Groove with you.  
Just spending my days with you.  
  
Oh, love is all in your eyes,  
Love fire is burning for me.  
You stay all in my mind.  
Oh woman, its easy to see.  
Oh, let's be fair  
You know its time we cleared the air  
  
You've been watching me, I've been watching you.  
You know, you know,  
Groove with you.  
Oh I want a groove, I want a groove  
Groove with you.  
I've been thinking, you've been thinking, thinking of me.  
Groove with you.  
Oh what I wouldn't do to groove with you.  
  
Groove with you.  
You've been watching, I been watching watching you  
Groove with you  
And every chance I get, from the first time we meet  
I want a groove with you.

I guess I'll always love you  
You've got the love I need  
You've got the love I need  
  
Open up your arms  
And let me walk on in  
Open up your heart  
And let me live again  
  
When you left you left with me  
A dream no longer reality  
I live the shadows of our past  
With this love that's born to last  
  
I guess I'll always love you  
You've got the love I need  
You've got the love I need  
  
The only time I'm happy  
Is when you're on my mind  
Every day I live  
All my love I give  
  
I've been a thousand places  
Seen your smile on a thousand faces  
No matter what I try to do  
I'm always dreaming of you  
  
I guess I'll always love you  
You've got the love I need  
You've got the love I need  
  
Every boy that passes by  
I see your sparkle in his eye  
Right away I stop and stare  
Close my eyes and see you there  
  
Whenever I feel almost free  
Memories take hold of me  
I love you now so much more  
Than I ever did before  
  
I guess I'll always love you  
I guess I'll always love you  
I guess I'll always love you  

Every day I think of you  
Can't believe it's true that I'm so into you  
That I don't know where I'm goin'  
I never felt this way before  
  
All I want to do is to love you, baby  
Behind closed doors  
Ooh, I once had your lovin', baby  
And I can't let go  
I once had your lovin', baby  
And I can't let go  
I once had your lovin', baby  
And I can't let go  
Don't let go  
  
All of the good times that we shared  
Every day's a holiday  
We could celebrate makin' love together  
Ooh, let's keep this fire burnin'  
Every day is new, girl  
When I think of you I get so excited  
Ooh, you keep my whole world turnin'  
  
I just had your lovin', baby  
And I can't let go  
I once had your loving, baby  
And I can't let go  
I once had your loving, baby  
And I can't let go  
Don't let go  
All of the good times that we shared  
Can't let you go  
Can't let you go  
Can't let you go  
Can't let you go  
Girl, I can't let you go  
  
Sure as Heaven above we've found love  
You and I can fly away  
Maybe to L.A. or some lovely island  
Take a stroll along the ocean  
Building castles in the sand  
Doin' all the things we planned together  
Ooh, I love you so much, baby  
  
I once had your lovin', baby  
And I can't let go  
I once had your lovin', baby  
And I can't let go  
I once had your lovin', baby  
And I can't let go  
Don't let go

And I can't let go  
I once had your lovin', baby  
And I can't let go  
I once had your lovin', baby  
And I can't let go  
Can't let it go, girl  
  
I once had your lovin', baby  
And I can't let go  
I once had your lovin', baby  
And I can't let go  
I once had your lovin', baby

You're the one that makes my day a dream come true  
Yet and still you wander if I think of you  
You ought to see how the other girls behave when you're not round  
And only then you would know that it's on your finger I'm wound  
  
If you were there you'd know  
If you were there you'd know  
If you were there you'd know  
If you were there you'd know  
That I care  
  
There's no need for you not to have faith in me no  
'Cause it's by your side girl that I long to be  
Yes there are times with my friends when I don't have much to say  
What you don't know is with you I can never act that way  
  
If you were there you'd know  
If you were there you'd know  
If you were there you'd know  
If you were there you'd know  
That I care  
  
I care for you baby  
I swear that I care  
I care  
  
There's no need for you not to have faith in me  
Have faith in me  
I care for you baby

La da da  
I just came here to chill  
We been kickin' it for quite some time  
Lots of private parties where we're winding down  
Tonight I'm in a different mood  
Just want to get close to you  
No RSVP necessary  
Tonight it's me and you, girl  
Didn't bring my diamonds  
You don't have to put a dress on  
I just came here to chill  
There'll be no other VIP  
The party's only you and me  
I just came here to chill  
You're a special lady  
The world can see  
Nobody makes a room shine  
Like you and me  
You always know just what to wear  
Nails just right, lovely hair  
No need to put your makeup on  
I'm not Mr. Big, ?cause tonight I'm just [incomprehensible]  
Didn't bring my diamonds  
You don't have to put a dress on  
I just came here to chill  
There'll be no other VIP  
The party's only you and me  
See I, I just came here to chill  
I don't mind a little champagne  
But no private chefs or restaurants  
Just a little home cookin' on the spot, yeah  
No invitations with our names  
No shakin' hands with all the you-know-who's  
My focus is on you  
Didn't bring my diamonds  
You don't have to put a dress on  
See I, I just came here to chill  
There'll be no other VIP  
The party's only you and me  
See I, I just came here to chill

You don't have to put a dress on  
See I, I just came here to chill  
There'll be no other VIP  
The party's only you and me  
See I, I just came here to chill  
No Escalades parked in the valet  
Parked in the valet  
No red-eye flights, I'm stayin' in LA  
No movie stars with fancy cars  
No backstage passes to the latest show  
Tell R. Kelly we ain't coming no  
No relatives, no friends we know  
?Cause I just came here to chill  
Didn't bring my diamonds  
You don't have to put a dress on  
I just came here to chill  
There'll be no other VIP  
The party's only you and me  
See I, I just came here to chill  

Oh, oh  
Yeah, yeah yeah  
  
How can I refuse your body laying next to me  
I wanna know if you see the same thing that I see  
Listen baby  
Laying right here in your bed is where I wanna be  
Making love to your body with your body on top of me  
  
[Chorus]

Does it feel good to your body baby  
Make you feel right  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, keep on pushing babe  
Don't stop now

And round and round and round  
It's time to go down  
Don't stop what you doing babe cuz  
I'm going down  
  
[Chorus]

When he's standing, standing  
Standing in front of you  
  
Lay, lady, lay  
Lay across my big brass bed

Is love behind me?  
Though I need you to satisfy me  
Destiny will prove to divide me  
For you're a part of me  
I feel the love within you  
Your beauty lies deep within you  
Touching me when you feel the need to  
Become as one with me  
  
[Chorus]  
So let me down easy  
If ever you were to leave  
My love, let me down easy  
For all I know is you  
  
Take you for granted?  
That could never, never be  
An advantage  
All this love, and free from demanding  
You have always felt the need to be pleased  
And you stay close beside me  
Though our minds are free for deciding  
The life to lead and desiring  
To see what they can see  
  
Oooh!  
Let me down easy  
If ever you were to leave  
My love, let me down easy  
Ooohhh...  
  
Ah! Spending time, time with you  
Counting the days of my life  
Oh, hoping that, that with me  
You will stay  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Being around you  
Lovely things I feel are about you  
Being strong until I'm without you  
For you're the strength in me  
And you give me inspiration  
Realizing that it has taken  
More love and more love makin'  
To fulfill my every need  
  
So for me  
Let me down easy  
If ever you were to leave  
My love, let me down easy  
  
If ever you were to leave  
My love, let me down  
Oh, easy  
  
If ever you were to leave  
My lo-ove, let me down, let me down, let me down  
Easy, baby  
  
Oh-ho! Let me down, hey, down, down, down, down  
Easy  
Hey, if ever, if ever, ever, ever you were to leave me

Giving my life directions, when I am turned

Princess Imperial of my soul  
Don't really matter if you choose not to answer  
Hoping what I reveal you already know

Put yourself in my place  
If only for a day  
See if you can stand  
The awful hurt I feel inside  
  
Put yourself in my place  
For just a little while  
Live through the loneliness  
The endless emptiness  
I go through  
  
And when you lose a little sleep at night  
Cause you ain't been treated right  
Then you know heartaches are sad  
Sitting by the telephone  
Being left all alone  
Then you know why I'm feeling bad  
Put yourself in my place  
  
And when you're just about to go insane  
Cause it hurts to love in vain  
Ask a girl who's been in love  
I believed your evil line  
Now I'm left alone and crying  
Alone to count the stars above  
  
Put yourself in my place  
If only for a day  
See if you can stand  
The awful emptiness  
I feel inside  
Put yourself in my place  
  
Put yourself in my place  
For just a little while  
Why don't you try it  
Why don't you try it  
Why don't you try it baby

Another night when we'll feel the joy

Creates a world we want to grow

Stop! In The Name Of Love  
Before you break my heart  
  
Baby, baby, I'm aware of where you go  
Each time you leave my door  
I watch you walk down the street  
Knowing your other love you'll meet  
This time before you run to her  
Leaving me alone and hurt  
(Think it over) After I've been good to you?  
(Think it over) After I've been sweet to you?  
  
Stop! In The Name Of Love  
Before you break my heart  
Stop! In The Name Of Love  
Before you break my heart  
Think it over  
Think it over  
  
I've known of your, your secluded nights  
I've even seen her maybe once or twice  
But is her sweet expression  
Worth more than my love and affection?  
But this time before you leave my arms  
And rush off to her charms  
(Think it over) Haven't I been good to you?  
(Think it over) Haven't I been sweet to you?  
  
Stop! In The Name Of Love  
Before you break my heart  
Stop! In The Name of Love  
Before you break my heart  
Think it over  
Think it over  
  
I've tried so hard, hard to be patient  
Hoping you'll stop this infatuation  
But each time you are together  
I'm so afraid I'll be losing you forever  
  
Stop! In The Name Of Love  
Before you break my heart  
Stop! In The Name Of Love  
Before you break my heart  
Stop! In The Name Of Love  
Before you break my heart

See the curtains hanging in the window  
In the evening on a Friday night  
A little light a-shining through the window  
Lets me know everythings alright  
  
[Chorus]  
Summer breeze makes me feel fine  
Blowing through the jasmine in my mind  
Summer breeze makes me feel fine  
Blowing through the jasmine in my mind  
  
See the paper lying on the sidewalk  
A little music from the house next door  
So I walk on up to the door step  
Through the screen and across the floor  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Sweet days of summer, the jasmine's in bloom  
July is dressed up and playing her tune  
When I come home from a hard days work  
And you're waiting there, not a care in the world  
  
See the smile a-waiting in the kitchen  
Food cooking and the plates for two  
Feel the arms that reach out to hold me  
In the evening when the day is through  
  
[Chorus]

Politician come to power take it slow  
People need what you know  
You're a leader so you have to play along  
Show the hand right or wrong  
When you're feelin' that you know the way to turn  
Either way still get burned  
It's the pride that makes you feel that you belong  
It's the pride that keeps you strong  
  
Don't you think it's fascinating?  
Don't you think it's fascinating?  
It's the pride that you feel it's the pride  
(When you finally break it all down it's the pride)  
It's the pride that you feel it's the pride  
(When you finally break it all down it's the pride)  
  
What makes you want to do the best you can?  
What makes you a better man?  
What makes you try again before too long?  
What keeps you standing strong?  
What makes you say the things you want to say,  
To make it a better day?  
It's the pride that makes you feel that you belong  
It's the pride that keeps you strong  
  
Don't you think it's fascinating?  
Don't you think it's fascinating?  
It's the pride that you feel it's the pride  
(When you finally break it all down it's the pride)  
It's the pride that you feel it's the pride  
(When you finally break it all down it's the pride)

What good are words I say to you?  
They can't convey to you what's in my heart  
If you could hear  
Instead  
The things I've left unsaid  
  
Time after time  
I tell myself that I'm  
So lucky to be loving you  
  
So lucky to be  
The one you run to see  
In the evening, when the day is through  
  
I only know what I  
Know  
The passing years will show  
You've kept my love so young, so new  
  
And time after time  
You'll hear  
Me say that I'm  
So lucky to be loving you
