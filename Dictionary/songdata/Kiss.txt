A world without heroes  
Is like a world without sun  
You can't look up to anyone  
Without heroes  
  
And a world without heroes  
Is like a never ending race  
Is like a time without a place  
A pointless thing devoid of grace  
  
Where you don't know what you're after  
Or if something's after you  
And you don't know why you don't know  
In a world without heroes  
  
In a world without dreams  
Things are no more than they seem  
And a world without heroes  
Is like a bird without wings  
Or a bell that never rings  
Just a sad and useless thing  
  
Where you don't know what you're after  
Or if something's after you  
And you don't know why you don't know  
  
In a world without heroes  
There's nothing to be  
It's no place for me

You were standin' and I was thinkin'  
Of all the time that I spend hangin' around  
Situation could only get better  
I got closer to see what I found  
In the mornin', movin' easy  
Everything seems so right  
But when the night comes, I've been dreamin'  
Dreamin' 'bout leavin' you one more time  
  
Girl, you gave me good love  
But it ain't quite right  
  
Mmm, no, I won't tell you  
That you're the only one for me  
And I'd be a liar if I promised  
I could give you every single thing you ever need  
  
You gave me good love  
But it ain't quite right  
  
Yeah, you gave me good love  
But it ain't quite right, mmm  
  
Lookin' back now seems so easy  
You were the best thing ever happened to me  
I can't complain  
It was worth every minute we had  
  
'Cause, you gave me good love  
But it ain't quite right  
  
Yeah, you gave me good love  
But it ain't quite right

You do me wrong but still I'm crazy about you  
Stay away too long and I can't live without you  
Every chance you get you seem to hurt me more and more  
But each hurt makes my love stronger than before  
I know flowers go through rain, how can love go through pain?  
  
Ain't that peculiar?  
Peculiar as can be  
Ain't that peculiar?  
That's what it is to me, hey  
  
You tell me lies that should be obvious to me  
But there is so much lovin' to see  
But the things you do and say are designed to make me blue  
It's a doggone shame my love for you makes all your lies seem true  
But if truth makes love last longer, why do lies make my love stronger  
  
Ain't that peculiar?  
Peculiar as can be  
Ain't that peculiar?  
That's what it is to me  
  
Hey, hey  
Hey, hey  
Hey, hey  
Hey, hey  
Hey, hey  
  
Hey, hey  
Hey, hey  
Hey, hey  
Hey, hey  
Hey, hey, hey  
  
If hurt can last for years, how can love last through tears?  
  
Ain't that peculiar?  
Peculiar as can be  
Ain't that peculiar?  
That's what it is to me  
  
Ain't that peculiar?  
Oh yeah, that's what it is  
Ain't that peculiar?  
Oh c'mon, yeah, yeah

Yeah  
Mama told me, "Your lady's lookin' for another man"  
I never worry, there ain't a need for me to take no stand  
I got my reasons, the things I do are better left unsaid  
I'm into pleasin', I do my talkin' with my hands instead  
  
'Cause I can make some time  
You got your ticket and you're lookin' fine  
You're starin' at the man, you want to land  
A six foot, hot look, all American man, yeah  
  
I've been to Detroit, I've been to L.A. and I've seen St. Lou  
I've had some good times, but I've been waitin' for a girl like you  
  
'Cause I can make some time  
You got your ticket and you're lookin' fine  
You're starin' at the man, you want to land  
A six foot, hot look, all American man, yeah  
  
All American man  
'Cause I can make some time  
You got your ticket and you're lookin' fine  
You're starin' at the man, you want to land  
A six foot, hot look, all American man, a man  
  
I'm a six foot, hot look, all American man, yeah

One, two, three, four  
You've got a lot to say  
Every night and every sunny day  
It's the same thing you've been sayin' to me  
Every day  
You say it's within your heart  
You keep repeatin' that we'll never part  
I'm so finally glad to hear you stop  
For a day  
You just keep talkin' louder  
Complain to your mother and father  
One of these days you'll push me all the way  
And (you wear it?) you're worried 'cause it fits you well  
Baby, baby, you're not hard to sell  
I'll tell you what you want to hear  
For a day  
So if you think you need advice  
Just come to me, don't compromise  
Baby, baby you're hypnotized  
Every day  
And you just keep talkin' louder  
Complain to your mother and father  
One of these days you'll push me all the way  
Yes, you just keep talkin' louder  
Complain to your mother and father  
One of these days you'll push me all the way  
Yes, you just keep talkin' louder  
Complain to your mother and father  
One of these days you'll push me all the way  
You just keep talkin' louder  
Complain to your mother and father  
One of these days you'll push me all the way  
You just keep talkin' louder  
Complain to your mother and father  
One of these days you'll push me all the way

Ahh, ha

The moon is out, I think I'm gonna change  
You're so smooth and tender, a living, breathing dream  
I've got to have you, baby, I'm listenin' for your scream

Almost, almost, almost, almost, almost, almost human

I'm almost human

The sky is fallin' and the wheels of life are grindin' out a brand new beat  
The streets are burnin' with the call of the wild, and I can feel the heat  
They'll call you names and spit in your face, but legends never die  
Just pick up your guitar, on your knees and pray and hold your head up high  
  
And on the eighth day God created rock and roll  
On the eighth day God created rock and roll  
  
Out of the ashes came the dawn and the shape of things to come  
Never surrender, just carry on, straight to kingdom come  
You sold your soul and virginity, ya can't rape a heart of gold  
Yes you're born to rule, it's destiny, now it can be told  
  
And on the eighth day God created rock and roll (rock and roll)  
And on the eighth day God created rock and roll

And on the eighth day God created rock and roll

Anything for my baby  
I would steal anything for my baby  
I'd wheel and deal anything for my baby  
  
Oh  
I'm in love and it feels so good  
Cause I need her, don't mistreat her  
And I tell her so  
  
When I saw her and she looked my way  
I was lonely, she's my only  
And I've gotta say that  
  
I would steal anything for my baby  
I'd wheel and deal anything for my baby  
Crawl or kneel, anything for my baby  
  
In the morning when I raise my head  
She's beside me, she can hide me  
When I'm feelin' low  
  
If I'm thinkin' everything's all wrong  
My girl shakes me, she awakes me  
Then I really know that  
  
I would steal anything for my baby  
I'd wheel and deal anything for my baby  
Crawl or kneel, anything for my baby  
  
Don't you know that  
I would steal anything for my baby  
I would wheel and deal anything for my baby  
I would crawl or kneel, anything for my baby  
I'd do anything  
  
I would give anything for my baby  
I would die or live, anything for my baby  
I would t-t-t-t-take or give anything for my baby  
  
Yes, I would take anything for my baby  
I would build or break anything for my baby  
I would rob or take anything for my baby  
  
I would do anything for my baby  
I would steal anything for my baby  
I would wheel and deal

Yeah  
In the beginning there was darkness and there was light  
At the dawn of creation there was fear in the dead of night  
There was thunder, there was flame  
The whole wide world is driving me insane  
  
Don't want to run, don't want to hide  
I keep the fire burning deep inside  
I howl at the moon, I pray to the sun  
I've got a one-way ticket to kingdom come  
  
I'm going back to the stone age  
I'm going back where I belong  
I'm going back to the stone age  
Back where I come from  
  
Telling the world I'm going back where I belong  
To a place where the sky is clear, the wind is strong  
Climb the mountains, cross the seas  
Clear in my soul I want to be free  
Sit on the throne, let 'em kiss the ring  
'Cause I'm a stone age man (yeah)  
  
(I'm the king) back to the stone age  
Back where I belong  
I'm going back to the stone age  
Back where I belong  
  
I like it  
  
Yeah  
  
Back to the stone age (I'm going back)  
Back to the stone age (I'm going back)  
Back to the stone age (yeah)  
Bye-bye, so long

I just can't understand the ways  
Of all the men and their mistakes  
You give them all your heart  
And then they rip it all away  
  
You told me how much you loved me  
And how our love was meant to be  
And I believed in you  
I thought that you would set me free  
  
(Refrain):  
You should've just told me the truth  
That I wasn't the girl for you  
Still, I didn't have a clue  
So my heart depended on you, whoa  
  
[Chorus:]:  
Although I'll say I hate you now  
Though I'll shout and curse you out  
I'll always have love for you  
Because I am a girl  
  
Been told a man will leave you cold  
Get sick of you and bored  
I know that it's no lie  
I gave my all, still I just cry  
  
Never again will I be fooled  
To give my all when nothing's true  
I won't be played again  
But I will fall in love again  
  
(Refrain)  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Been told a man will leave you cold  
Get sick of you and bored  
I know that it's no lie  
I gave my all, still I just cry  
  
Never again will I be fooled  
To give my all when nothing's true  
I won't be played again  
But I will fall in love again  
  
You took advantage of my willingness  
To do anything for love  
Now I'm the only one in pain  
Will you please take it all away  
  
Never thought being born a girl  
How I can love you and be burned  
And now I will build a wall  
To never get torn again  
  
[Chorus:] [2x]

Beth I hear you calling  
But I can't come home right now  
Me and the boys are playing  
And we just can't find the sound  
  
Just a few more hours  
And I'll be right home to you  
I think I hear them calling  
Oh Beth what can I do  
Beth what can I do  
  
You say you feel so empty  
That our house just ain't our home  
I'm always somewhere else  
And you're always there alone  
  
Just a few more hours  
And I'll be right home to you  
I think I hear them calling  
Oh Beth what can I do  
Beth what can I do  
  
Beth I know you're lonely  
And I hope you'll be alright  
Cause me and the boys will be playing all night

You pay your taxes, you pay the rent, till you haven't got a cent  
It's the law of the jungle, if you got the hunger  
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger  
Just hold on to what you got (hold on, hold on), just live it to the last drop  
You can't help it, you just can't stop  
  
Betrayed, yeah, life's a bitch, so just don't feel  
Betrayed, no, you ain't the only one who's been betrayed, betrayed  
  
Stone cold and all alone, and you're wearin' everything you own  
They bare your flesh and strip your soul, but underneath you got a heart of
gold  
Just hold on to what you got (hold on, hold on)  
  
Betrayed, you ain't satisfied, I know you feel betrayed  
You ain't crucified, so get real, betrayed, betrayed  
  
All alone, far from home, and you're feelin' cold as stone  
Don't give up, don't give in, life's a bitch if you lose or win  
  
Betrayed - yeah, you ain't the only one who's been  
Betrayed - life's a bitch, if you lose or win - betrayed, betrayed , betrayed,
betrayed

Gonna throw down the dice on a roll, it's a showdown, gonna walk on hot coals  
Cut the deck, better place your bet, 'cause the game ain't over yet  
  
Want to keep you under lock and key, can't you see what you do to me  
Get the noose, I know I'm gonna hang, 'cause you're like a boomerang,
boomerang  
  
On the way up, you change your tune, so pay up, and it ain't too soon  
Can't make up or break up, can't feel a thing, you want a piece of everything  
  
First you're cold and then you're hot, you're in the mood and then you're not  
Yeah, I know I'll get a bang, 'cause you're like a boomerang, boomerang  
  
You can slip and you can slide, but there ain't nothin' you can hide  
You just can't say no, well here I come, baby, and here I go  
  
A boomerang, a boomerang

One, two, one, two, three, four  
  
I'm the gift and giver, not a woman mistreater, you know that is no one else  
You can have me just one time baby, she said  
Baby, I'll give you a chance, 'cause I'm  
  
Burning up with fever, and you're the fever inside  
I'm burning up with fever, it's something I can't hide  
  
Sometimes you do me, sometimes you don't, I know, I want you all the time  
Here's one thing you should know, I won't, I won't stand in line for your love  
  
Burning up with fever, and you're the fever inside  
I'm burning up with fever, it's something I can't hide  
Sometimes you do me, sometimes you don't  
I know, I want you all the time, but I'm  
  
Burning up with fever, and you're the fever inside  
I'm burning up with fever, it's something I can't hide  
  
I'm burning up with fever, and you're the fever inside  
I'm burning up with fever, it's something I can't hide

When I was seventeen, found out just what it means  
If you can get it free, it just ain't worth a damn  
When I heard the preacher say, don't throw your life away  
I got that message, and I wrote it on the wall  
I don't want anybody tellin' me lies, no, I don't want your diamond ring  
Cause you ain't got my size  
  
I want money, money, that's what I need,  
I got Cadillac dreams, please mister don'tcha take it from me  
Give me money, money, more than I need, I got Cadillac dreams waitin' on me  
Cadillac dreams, Cadillac dreams  
  
When I had the young boy blues, I paid some young boy dues  
I learned the hard way, there's a heartbreak every day  
Stone cold reality came crashing down on me  
Well life was hard on me, but I still don't give a damn  
When I was seventeen I was an angry young man  
But I won't let just anybody tell me who I am  
  
I just want money, money, that's all I need  
I got Cadillac dreams, hey mister don'tcha take it from me  
Give me money, money, more than I need, these Cadillac dreams are waitin' on
me  
Didn't have the time of day, till this dream was born  
You can't take that away, you can't take that away from me  
  
When I was seventeen, there was this beauty queen  
Checked in a one room suite, the back seat of my car  
When you want all the best things money can buy  
You gotta reach down inside of you, to reach up to the sky  
  
Yeah, I want money, money, that's all I need  
I got Cadillac dreams, hey mister you can't take that from me  
I want money, money, more than I need, I got Cadillac dreams waitin' on me  
Money, money, that's what I need  
We're drivin' in my Chevy with my Cadillac dreams  
Someday, one day, just you and me  
We'll ride inside these Cadillac dreams

I lived a life of illusion and you had your kicks  
So what, there's nothing left to do  
And you and your obsessions and your crucifix  
As if what I thought mattered much to you  
  
And you were always my friend  
From Childhood's End  
It was forever and ever  
Did you understand  
It's Childhood's End  
But never, the dream is over  
  
Sunday morning in the New York Times  
I read you died last night  
It said you were smilin' when you blew your mind  
And the note you left behind said  
  
You were always my friend  
From Childhood's End  
Seems like forever and ever  
Yeah, you won't have to have to pretend  
It's near the end  
You won't ever be a rock and roller  
Yeah, you were always my friend  
From Childhood's End  
But never, the dream is over  
You were just like me  
I was just like you  
For eternity I'll think of you  
  
(Repeat chorus, fade out)  
You've got something about you,  
You've got something I need

She's a dancer, a romancer  
I'm a Capricorn and she's a Cancer  
She saw my picture in a music magazine  
  
When she met me, said she'd get me  
Touched her hips and told me that she'd let me  
I took her hand, baby this is what I said  
  
I said baby, baby, don't you hesitate  
Cause I just can't wait  
Lady, won't you take me down to my knees  
You can do what you please  
C'mon and love me  
  
I'm a man, I'm no baby  
And you're lookin' every inch a lady  
You're good lookin' and you're lookin' like you should be good  
  
You were distant, now you're nearer  
I can feel your face inside the mirror  
The lights are out and I can feel you, baby, with my hand  
  
So baby, baby, don't you hesitate  
Cause I just can't wait  
Lady, won't you take me down to my knees  
You can do what you please  
C'mon and love me  
C'mon and love me  
C'mon and love me  
C'mon and love me

Whoo, alright  
My heater's broke and I'm so tired  
I need some fuel to build a fire  
The girl next door, her lights are out, yeah  
The landlord's gone, I'm down and out  
  
Ooh, it's cold gin time again  
You know it'll always win  
Cold gin time again  
You know it's the only thing  
That keeps us together, ow  
  
It's time to leave and get another quart  
Around the corner at the liquor store  
Haha, the cheapest stuff is all I need  
To get me back on my feet again  
  
Ooh, it's cold gin time again

It's been a month or two since I was sleepin' with you  
I'm comin' home again  
I've been to east and west, but baby I like best  
The road that leads to you  
Oh girl, it seems the whole wide world seems to say  
Hotels that all look the same  
Just seem to drive me insane  
But I can't get away  
Until I receive a call that tells me that will be all  
And then I hop a plane  
It's true, I'm not sure if you knew  
I'm comin' home to you  
Oh girl, it seems the whole wide world seems to say  
Hotels that all look the same  
Just seem to drive me insane  
But I can't get away  
Until I receive a call that tells me that will be all  
And then I hop a plane  
It's true, I'm not sure if you knew  
I'm comin' home to you  
I'm comin' home to you  
I'm comin' home to you  
I'm comin' home, baby

People try to take my soul away, but I don't hear the rap that they all say  
They try to tell us we don't belong, that's alright, we're millions strong  
This is my music, it makes me proud, these are my people and this is my crowd  
  
These are crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy nights  
These are crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy nights  
  
Sometimes days are so hard to survive, a million ways to bury you alive  
The sun goes down like a bad bad dream  
You're wound up tight, gotta let off steam  
They say they can break you again and again, if life is a radio, turn up to
ten  
  
These are crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy nights  
These are crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy nights  
  
These are crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy nights  
These are crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy nights  
  
And they try to tell us that we don't belong  
But that's alright, we're millions strong  
You are my people, you are my crowd, this is our music, we love it loud  
  
Yeah, and nobody's gonna change me, 'cause that's who I am  
  
These are crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy nights  
These are crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy nights  
  
These are crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy nights  
These are crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy nights  
  
These are crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy nights  
These are crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy nights

Searching in the darkness  
Running from the day  
Hiding from tomorrow  
Nothing left to say  
  
Victims of the moment  
Future deep in doubt  
Living in a whisper  
Until we start to shout  
  
Ooh, we're creatures of the night  
Ooo, we're creatures of the night  
  
Breathing in the madness  
Spitting out the lies  
Searching for an answer  
Keep your alibis  
  
Don't know where we're going  
Just know where we've been  
Remember when the clock strikes twelve  
The losers always win  
  
Ooh, we're creatures of the night  
Ooh, we're creatures of the night

Baby, I know it's a jungle out there  
Well if you can play it cool, I can play it debonair  
You were warm, but there was an inner ice  
And baby, it was like a rollin' dice  
Well I told you once, I told you twice  
Hey listen babe, there's trouble in paradise  
Well I found a lipstick stain of your kiss  
Well you can sink your teeth into this, bitch, so  
  
I'm gonna dance, dance all over your face, I'm gonna dance all over your face  
I'm gonna dance, dance all over your face, I'm gonna dance all over your face  
  
Hey baby, can you pass this quiz  
Well, just put your money where your mouth is  
You're as sharp as a slap from a lover's hand  
Hey baby, baby, baby, this is all I can stand  
You played your hand, and now you lose, well listen bitch, I've got news  
Yes, I saw you with another man and you put me in disgrace, so  
  
I'm gonna dance, dance all over your face, I'm gonna dance all over your face  
I'm gonna dance, dance all over your face, I'm gonna dance all over your face  
  
Dance, dance all over your face, I'm gonna dance all over your face  
No cheap perfume can change my mind, no satin and lace  
Yes, I'm gonna dance all over your face  
No thigh high boots, forbidden fruits, no satin and lace  
Yes, I'm gonna dance, dance all over your face, I'm gonna dance

In the night I will be waitin'  
Ready to go, soon as the daylight is fadin'  
In the night my heart is beating  
Out of control, can't stop the way that I'm feeling  
I want to know how far to go, takin' my life in my hands  
Out on my own, fighting alone, call me the desperate man  
  
Danger, danger, give me danger, danger  
Give me measures of pleasure and pain, boiling the blood in my veins  
Danger, danger, give me danger, danger  
Give me nothing to stand in my way, I'll make the best of my days  
  
In the night, oh, I can feel it  
Time slips away, if I can't pay I will steal it  
In the night I will be screamin'  
Hour by hour livin' the life that I'm dreamin'  
Under the gun, I'll be the one, walking the edge of the knife  
Taking the best, leaving the rest, I'm gonna run for my life  
  
Danger, danger, give me danger, danger  
Give me measures of pleasure and pain, boiling the blood in my veins  
Danger, danger, give me danger, danger  
Give me nothing to stand in my way, I'll make the best of my days  
I want to know how far to go, takin' my life in my hands  
Out on my own, fighting alone, call me the desperate man  
  
Danger, danger, give me danger, danger  
Give me fires that endlessly burn, I've passed the point of return  
Danger, danger, danger, danger, danger, danger

[Verse]  
Heaven, please send me someone to love  
Angels know what I've been dreaming of  
Tell me about your fantasies  
You know what I need tonight  
Baby, you and me, we're like TNT  
Light the dynamite  
  
[Chorus]  
Too much trouble (too much trouble)  
Double that ... (double ...)  
Danger you  
Danger me  
Danger us  
  
[Verse]  
I know, people don't always know what they need  
Passion play can make a lonely heart bleed  
I don't want my candy sweet  
You don't want your lovin' nice  
Everytime we meet, we're like TNT  
Light the dynamite  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Too much trouble (too much trouble)  
Ready, steady, ... (ready, steady, ...)  
Danger you

Too much trouble (too much trouble)  
Ready, steady, ... (ready, steady, ...)  
Danger you  
Danger me  
Danger us  
  
Wow!  
  
Oh yeah...

Look out, 'cause there's something wrong  
And you don't know what it is  
Watch out, or it's Sodom and Gomorrah  
The malevolent order  
Right now, before it's much too late  
Before it's much too late  
A dark light, a darkness never ending  
A dark light, the devil gets his due  
A dark night, is everywhere descending  
A dark light, is coming for you  
Now look up, well the skies are black  
And they're getting darker all the time  
Watch out, for the things that you believe in  
You're gonna be attacked,  
And you won't know what it is  
Wise up, you better watch your step  
You better watch your step  
A dark light, a darkness never ending  
A dark light, of perversion and hate  
A dark night, is everywhere descending  
A dark light, there's no time to wait  
Look out, for the death of love  
There will be no more love  
Watch out, it's yourself that you are fooling  
Who do you think you're fooling  
Shout it out, it's a terrible thing  
Such a terrible thing  
A dark light, a darkness never ending  
A dark light, the sun is turning cool  
A dark night, is everywhere descending  
A dark light, is shining at you  
Dark light, dark light  
Is shining at you, dark light

People all around me lettin' me bleed  
Waitin' for the darkness to blind the heat  
I make my livin' out on the streets  
  
Dirty livin', ahh, dirty livin'  
I can't wait any longer to set myself free  
  
Flashin' lights keep runnin' through my brain

Now lemme tell ya my story, I got a man-sized predicament  
And it's a big one, goes like this, yeah  
My my, ow, yeah!  
Never had confession, never had a home  
Never had no worry, until I met Domino  
Ain't the virgin Mary, love her I confess  
Got my hesitations, 'cause she kisses like the kiss of death  
Loves lots of money, back's against the wall  
Calls me Sugar Daddy, she knows she's got me by the balls  
They call her Domino - so fine  
Got a reputation, haven't got a hope  
It's a sticky situation, if she ain't old enough to vote  
Loves to play with fire, loves to hurt so good  
Loves to keep me burnin', 'cause she's a bad habit, bad habit  
Bad habit that's good, good, good  
They call her Domino, Domino, Domino  
Every damn time I walk through that door, it's the same damn thing  
That bitch bends over, and I forget my name - ow!  
Loves lots of money, back's against the wall  
Calls me Sugar Daddy, she knows she's got me by the balls - ow!  
Loves to play with fire, love her I confess  
Got no hesitations, cause she's a bad habit,  
Bad habit, she's a bad habit!  
Yeah

Baby, don't you let me down (don't you let me down)  
Don't you leave me lonely (don't you leave me lonely)

Try to keep my chin up, feel I'm fallin' farther down  
Ooh, you know I'm feelin' sorry

Ooh, looks like there's no tomorrow  
There's no tomorrow without you  
  
Baby (baby) don't you let me down (don't you let me down)  
Don't you leave me lonely (don't you leave me lonely)

Close your eyes and take a look at your life  
Do you like what you see  
My eyes are open but I feel like I'm blind, it's all returning to me  
I want to know, does a frozen river flow  
Things you said fill my head lying in a cold and empty bed  
  
I'm only dreaming  
Between the darkness and the light  
I'm only dreaming, oooh  
Dreaming, can't tell the daylight from the night  
I'm only dreaming, dreaming  
  
I feel the sunlight shining down on my face  
Not a cloud in my mind  
I get my wake up but it never comes in time  
My prayers are spoken and I wait to receive  
Cause there's a fine line between the truth and how we want it to be  
  
I'm only dreaming  
Between the darkness and the light  
I'm only dreaming, oooh  
Dreaming, can't tell the daylight from the night  
I'm only dreaming, dreaming  
  
I'm sailing like a ship on the sea  
I don't care if I'm lost in the haze  
I hear the angels singing something to me  
(?)Come dream of me(?), that you never see  
Won't you come slip away  
  
I am only dreaming  
I'm only dreaming (x 6)  
  
Dreaming  
Dreaming.

Tryin' to say I'm sorry, didn't mean to break your heart  
And find you waitin' up by the light of day  
There's a lot I want to tell you, but I don't know where to start  
And I don't know what I'd do if you walked away  
Ooh, baby I tried to make it, I just got lost along the way  
But every time I look at you,  
No matter what I'm goin' through, it's easy to see  
And every time I hold you, the things I never told you,  
Seem to come easily  
Cause you're everything to me  
I never really wanted to let you get inside my heart  
I wanted to believe this would soon be ending  
I thought it wouldn't matter, if it all just came apart  
But now I realize I was just pretending  
Ooh, baby, I know I hurt you, but you can still believe in me  
But every time I look at you, no matter what I'm goin' through,  
It's easy to see  
And every time I hold you, the things I never told you,  
Seem to come easily  
Cause you're everything to me  
It's gonna take a little time to show you,  
Just what you mean to me, oh yeah  
It seems the more I get to know you, the more I need to make you see  
You're everything I need, yeah  
Oho, I need ya, I need ya, I need ya...  
Ooh, baby, baby, baby, I know I hurt you,  
But you can still believe in me

My parents think I'm crazy and they hate the things I do  
I'm stupid and I'm lazy, man, if they only knew  
  
How flaming youth will set the world on fire  
Flaming youth, our flag is flying higher and higher and higher  
  
My uniform is leather, and my power is my age  
I'm gettin' it together to break out of my cage  
  
Cause flaming youth will set the world on fire  
Flaming youth will set the world on fire  
Flaming youth, our flag is flying higher and higher and higher

I gotta tell you what I'm feelin' inside,  
I could lie to myself, but it's true  
There's no denying when I look in your eyes,  
Girl I'm out of my head over you  
And I lived so long believin' all love is blind  
But everything about you is tellin' me this time  
  
It's forever, this time I know and there's no doubt in my mind  
Forever, until my life is through, girl I'll be lovin' you forever  
  
I hear the echo of a promise I made  
When you're strong you can stand on your own  
But those words grow distant as I look at your face  
No, I don't want to go it alone  
I never thought I'd lay my heart on the line  
But everything about you is tellin' me this time  
  
It's forever, this time I know and there's no doubt in my mind  
Forever, until my life is through, girl I'll be lovin' you forever - yeah!  
  
Oooh  
I see my future when I look in your eyes  
It took your love to make my heart come alive  
'Cause I lived my life believin' all love is blind  
But everything about you is tellin' me this time  
  
It's forever, this time I know and there's no doubt in my mind  
Forever, until my life is through, girl I'll be lovin' you forever  
  
Oooh  
It's forever, this time I know and there's no doubt in my mind  
Forever, until my life is through, girl I'll be lovin' you forever  
  
Yeah

I used to wonder why  
When I was walking by  
They talked about me  
What could it be  
They tried to break me  
Never could make me  
  
Out in the streets  
Takin' all the heat  
Dancin' in the sheets, oh yeah  
  
All those streaks in my hair  
People point at me and stare  
If they ask me I'll say, "yeah!"  
I'm a freak  
And I love the clothes I wear  
Where their life goes I don't care  
It's my price I'm proud to pay  
I'm a freak  
  
The called me crazy  
It doesn't faze me  
I'm doing fine, they're doing time  
They tried to break me  
Never could make me  
Live like a fire  
Dancin' with desire  
Walkin' on the wire, oh yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah)  
  
I'm a freak and love what I see  
I'm a freak and I love being me (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)  
  
Out in the streets  
Takin' all the heat  
Dancin' in the sheets, oh yeah  
  
I pledge allegiance to the state of independence  
  
I got streaks in my hair  
People point at me and stare  
If they ask me I'll say, "yeah!"  
I'm a freak  
And I love the clothes I wear  
Where their life goes I don't care  
It's my price I'm proud to pay  
I'm a freak  
I'm the freak and I love what I see  
I'm the freak and I love being me  
I'm a freak and that's all I can be  
I'm a freak, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
I pledge allegiance to the state of independence

I didn't know 'bout the modern ways of life, I didn't really care  
I never gave a damn about the future, I never got my share  
Somebody said, boy your time's a wastin', you're movin' much too slow  
So many things in life worth tastin', so much you oughta know - look out  
  
Get down, fool around, if you got half a chance, you take it  
Ooh yeah, stand your ground, you gotta bend the rules to make it  
Hold tight, see the light, think of all the dues you're payin'  
So true, I'm tellin' you, wise up, can't you hear me sayin'  
  
You gotta get all you can take - sing along, gotta keep on hummin'  
Stop waitin' for your lucky break - stop waitin', wastin' time  
What fuckin' difference does it make? - ooh, gotta keep it comin'  
You gotta get all you can take - doncha know I'm gonna take what's mine  
  
People lookin', eyes wide open, tell me what you see  
Bodies tired, minds 'a chokin', you gotta set 'em free  
Don't think about the race they're runnin', they'll never let you in  
With all the rules, it's a race of fools, and you can never win - look out  
  
Get down, fool around, think of all the dues you're payin'  
Oh yeah, stand your ground, wise up, can't you hear me sayin'  
  
You gotta get all you can take - sing along, gotta keep on hummin'  
Stop waitin' for your lucky break - stop waitin', wastin' time

I've been tryin' to get away  
To get away  
To leave this old town  
I've been tryin' to see my way  
To see my way  
So I won't be found  
  
Many times I've felt alone  
I've felt alone  
But that's all behind  
One thing I know  
I know  
One thing is that  
  
I know I have to go  
Got no dough  
Should I stay or should I go  
Gotta get away  
Don't want to stay  
Leavin' tomorrow by subway  
  
Some people, they tell me  
They tell me  
I've been here to long  
It don't compel me  
They tell me  
I just don't belong  
Sometimes I wonder  
I wonder  
What's right or what's wrong  
One thing I  
I know  
One thing is that  
  
I know I have to go  
Got no dough  
Should I stay or should I go  
Gotta get away  
Don't want to stay  
Leavin' tomorrow by subway  
  
I gotta get away  
Get away, get away, get away  
I gotta get away  
Yeah, baby get away, gotta, gotta, gotta get away  
Whoo, you've gotta get away

And I know how it should be  
There is nothing more for you and I  
Some are young and some are free  
But I think I'm goin' blind  
Cause, I think I'm goin' blind  
And I know how it's to be, yeah  
Little lady, can't you see  
You're so young and so much different than I  
I'm ninety three, you're sixteen  
Can't you see I'm goin' blind  
Cause, I think I'm goin' blind  
And I know how it's to be, yeah  
Cause, I think I'm goin' blind  
And I know how it's to be, yeah

I'm ninety three, you're sixteen  
And I think I'm goin' blind  
Yes, I think I'm goin' blind  
And I know how it's to be, yeah

It ain't love, but it ain't so bad  
She ain't nothin' like you ever had  
Face of a woman, hands of a child, yeah  
Been a long time comin', now she's goin' wild  
  
Well I know she ain't the girl next door  
She ain't the girl she was before  
  
She's a good girl gone bad, one kiss can driv  
Good girl - come on - show me the way  
  
The girl can't help it, she's out of control  
I gotta have her, she's so hot to hold, yeah  
She's gettin' her way, but I'm havin' my fun  
Steamin' up the window with the radio on  
  
She ain't searchin', she knows the score, it ain't love she's lookin' for  
But now she's gone too far, she found love in the back of my car  
  
She's a good girl gone bad, one kiss can drive me mad  
Good girl - come on - show me the way  
She's a good girl gone bad, the best love I ever had  
Good girl - come on - take me away, oh, take me away, take me away  
  
She ain't searchin', she knows the score, it ain't love she's lookin' for  
But now she's gone too far, I know  
  
She's a good girl gone bad, one kiss can drive me mad  
Good girl, come on, show me the way  
She's a good girl gone bad, the best love I ever had  
Good girl, come on, take me away

Ain't it funny how the time slips away  
'Cause now I'm leavin' and I wish I could stay  
People wonder why they don't get a chance  
They wait for music but they don't get to dance  
Mmm, well now I know when my work is through  
I'm gonna be with you  
So goodbye  
Is only for now  
'Cause I'm comin' back  
I swear it somehow  
  
Ain't it funny how we win but we lose  
We're given prizes that we don't get to use  
People wonder 'bout the things that we've got  
It seems so little but we know it's a lot  
Now I know when my work is through  
I'm gonna be with you, oh yeah  
I'm gonna be with you  
  
So goodbye, is only for now  
'Cause I'm comin' back, I swear it somehow  
Oh, goodbye is only for now  
'Cause I'm comin' back, I swear it somehow  
Sing it  
  
I'm on the run  
So I must go  
And I hate to leave  
I hope that you know  
  
Oh, goodbye is only for now  
'Cause I'm comin' back, I swear it somehow

We'd never have to say goodbye  
  
If never I held you  
My feeling's would never show  
It's time I start walkin'  
But there's so much you'll never know

Ooh, don't cry, lady, oh

Well, I recall days in the city  
And I think back, "Oh what a pity"  
Rememberin' how it wasn't pretty  
Every day life in the city  
Out in the street we had to take it  
With friends around, couldn't it  
What wasn't there, we had to make it  
Hangin' out down in the city  
  
The hard times are dead and gone  
But the hard times have made me strong  
And the hard times have made me see  
That the hard times ain't where I wanna be  
  
We had to fight to be accepted  
It wasn't right and I protested  
For hangin' out we got arrested  
Every day life in the city  
  
We'd go to school and then we'd cut out  
Go to the park and space our heads out  
We called it fun but there was some doubt  
Hangin' out down in the city  
  
The hard times are dead and gone  
But the hard times have made me strong  
And the hard times have made me see  
That the hard times ain't where I wanna be  
  
I don't wanna be there or even think back  
I don't wanna be there, now I'm on the right track, yeah  
  
The hard times are dead and gone  
But the hard times have made me strong  
And the hard times have made me see  
That the hard times ain't where I wanna be  
  
I don't wanna be there or even think back  
I don't wanna be there, 'cause I'm on the right track  
Now I'm on the right track  
I'm finally on the right track  
I'm finally on the right track

Hate, is what I am  
'cause underneath this heart  
There beats the heart of man  
  
You'll wear your crown  
When you're lyin' 6 feet underground  
Don't you think it's odd  
Man was created in the image of god  
  
All you martyrs and saviours  
Go through the same door  
Listen all you butchers, saints and sinners  
We've all been here before  
  
Yes, hate is what I am  
'cause underneath this heart  
There beats the heart of man  
  
So you're lookin' for a saviour  
But I'm here to tell ya  
You gotta save yourself  
Like a lamb to slaughter  
All you ever did was follow orders  
  
All you martyrs and saviours  
Go through the same door  
Listen all you butchers, saints and sinners,  
We've all been here before  
All you martyrs and saviours  
Go through the same door  
  
Hey listen all you butchers, saints and sinners,  
We've all been here before  
Hate hate!  
  
Yes, hate is what I am  
Cause' underneath this heart  
There beats the heart of man, man  
Man!

I rode the highway to heartache  
I took a trip on the ship of fools, whoa yeah!  
And I paid the price to have my way  
'Cause money makes the rules, yeah!  
  
Sing it!  
Lay down!  
I'm looking through ya'  
Stay down!  
You got what you should  
Pay now!  
All that you never would, it feels good!  
  
Hell or hallelujah!  
No matter what you do, I'm running through ya'  
Yeah!

We surrender our hearts to lose, yeah  
Times up there's nobody askin'  
This time I get to choose!  
Let me hear ya!  
Lay down!  
Don't say that you're sorry  
Stay down!  
I knew that you would  
Pay now!  
Don't say you're misunderstood, it feels good  
  
Hell or hallelujah!  
No matter what you do, I'm running through ya'  
One more time!  
Hell or hallelujah!  
C'mon c'mon  
The rest is up to you  
It's overdue, yeah

One heart is breakin'  
One chance I'm takin'  
No lies, no fakin'  
Goodbye, feels like it should!  
It feels good!

It's overdue, yeah!

I was so frightened  
I almost ran away  
I didn't know that I could do  
Anything I needed to  
  
And then a bolt of lightning  
Hit me on my head  
Then I began to see  
I just needed to believe in me  
  
Now I, I believe in me  
And I, I believe in something more  
Than you can understand  
Yes, I believe in me  
  
They said I didn't stand a chance  
I wouldn't win no way  
But I've got news for you  
There's nothing I can't do  
  
Ain't no pretending  
Ain't no make believe  
But I've got to be the one  
I gotta do what must be done  
  
Now I, I believe in me  
And I, I believe in something more  
Than you can understand  
Yes, I believe in me  
  
I believe in me  
Yes, I believe in me - yeah  
  
I don't need no money  
I don't need no fame...no  
I just need to believe in me  
And I know most definitely  
  
Don't need to get wasted  
It only holds me down  
I just need a will of my own  
And the balls to stand alone  
  
Now I, I believe in me  
And I, I believe in something more  
Than you can understand  
Yes, I believe in me  
Well do you really  
Yes, I believe in me  
Do you do you  
Yes, I believe in me  
I want to rock 'n roll  
Yes, I believe in me!  
  
Morpheus, you have been summoned here to offer your judgment of the boy  
Do you still deem him worthy of the Fellowship?  
I certainly do, my lord.  
As a matter of fact, I, I think you're going like this one. He's got the light
in his eyes and the look of a champion,  
A real champion...

This is New York, yo  
(It's getting dark)  
  
Night falls on the city  
Finds me all alone  
Makes me wonder  
Should I just go on home  
  
And I walk up the stairs  
To see if you're sill there  
Would you mind if  
I found you alone  
  
Then a cold wind came callin'  
Strange how it knew it'd bother me  
See the night would fade  
But the pain's gonna stay  
Makes me wonder  
Have you ever made love to me  
  
I can't stop the rain, here it comes again  
Lightnin' strikes across the sky  
Oh, I can't stop the rain, here it comes again  
Lightnin' only blinds my eyes  
  
Ain't it sad  
When the only love I ever had  
Just slips away  
Right through my fingers  
  
Ain't it a shame when I think of your name  
The only memory I have is it  
  
I can't stop the rain, here it comes again  
Lightnin' strikes across the sky  
Oh, I can't stop the rain, here it comes again  
It takes a witch to curse that goddamn sky  
  
I can't stop the rain, here it comes again  
Lightnin' strikes across the sky  
Oh, I can't stop the rain, here it comes again  
'Cause lightnin' only blinds my eyes  
  
Oh, I can't stop the rain, here it comes again  
'Cause lightnin' only blinds my eyes  
  
Can't stop it, blinds my eyes

When I look into the mirror  
Just can't believe, what do I see  
There's no wakin' from this nightmare  
And you're lost in your reality  
  
So you tell me all your secrets  
And you tell me that you're innocent  
There's something in your eyes I can see  
And my face keeps looking back at me  
  
You Confess  
You can't help yourself  
This living lie that you can't go on  
You're possessed  
You can't fool yourself  
You're the crime and you can't go on  
  
Another day, another sorrow  
No today and no tomorrow  
Try and wash away the shame  
And you smile in your picture frame  
  
You had a charmed life, but you think from grace  
And you're long gone without a trace  
You're all alone and wonder why  
And you laugh when you want to cry  
  
You Confess  
You can't help yourself  
This living lie that you can't go on  
You're possessed  
You can't fool yourself  
You're the crime and you can't go on  
  
You Confess  
You can't help yourself  
This living lie that you can't go on  
You're possessed  
You can't fool yourself  
You're the crime and it can't go on  
It can't go on  
  
God never spoke to me about your sin  
So livin' in our lies will test the faith  
So cut your straight lines on the mirror  
And dip your hands in holy water  
Try and wash away the shame  
'cause all you've got is your father's name  
(repeat choruses)

In the morning I raise my head  
And I'm thinkin' of days gone by  
And the thing I want out of life is  
I want you (I want you)  
I want you (I want you)  
  
You can run, you can hide  
But you never get away  
You can lie and deny  
But you know you're gonna pay  
Never loved, never thought you could  
Treat you right, girl, you know I would  
You can fight but tonight  
There's nothin' you can do  
  
I want you (I want you)  
Baby, baby, babe, I want you (I want you)  
  
You can walk in a haze  
You can travel till you die  
You can live in a dream  
And your life will pass you by  
Every day that you hesitate  
You're never changin' the hands of fate  
You can fight but tonight  
There's nothing you can do  
  
I want you (I want you)  
Baby, baby, babe I want you (I want you)  
  
In the morning I raise my head  
And I'm thinkin' of days gone by  
And the thing I want out of life is  
  
I want you (I want you)  
Baby, baby, babe I want you (I want you)  
Baby, baby, babe I want you (I want you)  
Baby, baby, babe I want you (I want you)  
I want you (I want you)  
I want you (I want you)  
I want you (I want you)  
I want you (I want you)  
Ah (I want you) (I want you)

Each and every day  
People turn away  
Change the things they feel  
Change the things they say  
  
We can never know  
Where our lives will lead  
Wherever you go  
Whenever you need  
  
I Will Be There  
want to be there  
I will hear you when you call  
Give you anything at all  
I Will Be There  
Anywhere  
Like a father to his son  
  
You are just a child  
All is yet to be  
Growing all the while  
Knowing when you leave  
  
I Will Be There  
want to be there  
Only blood will run so deep  
Seal the promise I will keep  
I Will Be There  
Anywhere  
Like a father to his son  
I can swear to only one  
  
Time moves quickly as the years go by  
All these moments slip away  
When I'm gone and life will carry on  
You will know someway  
  
I Will Be There  
I Will Be There  
I Will Be There  
want to be there  
Only blood will run so deep  
Seal the promise I will keep  
I Will Be There  
Like a father to his son  
I must swear to only one

Oh, let's get 'em, boys  
Too many women, I've got too little time  
I keep on tryin'  
Man, if it kills me I know that I'll go  
Dead, stiff, and smilin'  
Oh, don't need no doctor puttin' me to bed  
Give me the nurse and I'll make sure that she's fed  
Don't need no doctor giving me pills  
I'm hot enough to give you chills  
Livin' life for love, I'm alive, I'm alive  
I can't get enough (I can't get enough)  
Get it right (right) I'm alive  
  
Take a look in the Book of Love, man it's understood  
Right to the letter  
One pretty girl makes you feel pretty good  
Two's even better  
Oh, I learned my lesson, my golden rule  
You know I made the teachers stay after school  
Don't look for reasons, don't waste my time  
I've got the goods to make you mine  
  
Livin' life for love, I'm alive, yeah, I'm alive  
I can't get enough (I can't get enough)  
Get it right (right) I'm alive  
You know baby, you make my heart beat, alright  
  
Don't need no doctor  
Take a look at the Book of Love, man it's understood  
It ain't a crime to feel this good, no  
  
Livin' life for love, I'm alive, yeah, I'm alive  
I can't get enough (can't get enough)  
Get it right (right) I'm alive  
Sing it  
Livin' life, livin' life for love, I'm alive, I'm alive

Get it right I'm alive (I'm alive)  
Livin' life for love (livin' life for love)  
Livin' life for love (I'm alive)  
Livin' life for love, (yeah, can't get enough)  
Livin' life for love (I'm alive, whoo)  
Livin' life for love

Don't let me find you  
Sleepin' with another man  
Say you're gonna be true  
And stay and love me like you can  
'Cause I really love you and it's true  
I'm gonna love you rain or come shine  
  
Honey, won't you tell me  
You don't want nobody else  
Don't you tear my heart out  
And lay it on your shelf  
  
'Cause I really love you and it's true  
I'm gonna love you rain or come shine  
  
And I'm gonna love you (gonna love you)  
Rain or come shine (rain or come shine)  
You know you're gonna find me (gonna find me)  
Around you all the time (time)  
  
'Cause I really love you and it's true  
I'm gonna love you rain or come shine  
Rain or come shine, rain or come shine  
Rain or come shine, rain or come shine  
Rain or come shine, rain or come shine

I'm obnoxious and no one's home  
In My Head  
In My Head  
Cardboard boxes filled with hate  
In My Head  
They're In My Head  
Nest of termites, glowin' red  
In My Head  
They're In My Head  
  
Look behind the mask  
Try to find peace of mind  
And you'll find  
Just look behind the man  
And lead me by the hand  
  
Faded smiles behind dark shades  
In My Head  
In My Head  
Plastic icons, glowin' red  
In My Head  
They're In My Head  
I experiment with myself  
In My Head  
In My Head  
  
Look behind the glass  
Try to find peace of mind  
And you'll find  
Just look behind the man  
And lead me  
  
Look behind the glass  
Try to find peace of mind  
And you'll find  
Just look behind the man  
And lead me  
  
Look behind the man  
Look behind the glass  
Look behind the mask

You were in the right  
Until you're left stuck in the middle  
I still wonder why  
You gave it all for such a little  
  
You  
Tell me you're only  
Scared to be lonely  
On and on  
  
You  
Livin' on credit  
Want it, you get it  
Right or wrong  
  
You oughtta Take A Look In The Mirror  
Every line's gettin' clearer  
See the face you can't deny  
You appear to me  
Appear to be lost in confusion  
I don't want to live  
Only to die in your illusion  
  
You  
Dial information  
Station to station  
On and on  
  
You  
Lie to your lover  
Make him your cover  
Blindfold on  
  
You oughtta Take A Look In The Mirror  
Every line's gettin' clearer  
See the face you can't deny  
Take A Look In The Mirror  
All your fear gettin' nearer  
Nothin' left to get you by  
  
Only a matter of time  
Leavin' illusion behind  
Tick Tock  
  
You won't realize  
'Till all the eyes are truly open  
You can't hide away  
Throw what you may, when all is broken  
  
Go on and Take A Look In The Mirror  
All your fear gettin' nearer  
Nothin' left to get you buy  
  
You oughtta Take A Look In The Mirror  
Every line's gettin' clearer  
See the face you can't deny

I'll never cut my hair  
I'll never shed my skin  
I won't give in  
'cause that's the original sin  
  
Now I Know I don't belong  
Can't do right if I can't be wrong  
You won't catch me  
SInging the same old song  
No you won't  
  
Ask me no questions  
And I'll tell you no lies  
I never say never  
Yeah, I never say die  
  
Don't push me to the limit  
Wouldn't want to be in your place  
Better look out  
'Cause the ACE is in your face  
  
In your face  
I know I always go too far  
In your face  
Oh yeah, but I've been  
Saved by my guitar  
In your face  
They say I come from  
Another place  
In your face  
Oh yeah, I'm the man  
From outer space  
  
Now ask me no questions  
And I'll tell you no lies  
I never say never  
I never say die  
  
You might be hallucinating  
I can't tell if you are on glue  
What I can't have  
Is what I want  
I think you know it's true  
  
In your face  
I know I always go too far  
In your face  
Oh yeah, but I've been  
Saved by my guitar  
In your face  
Everyone knows I come from  
Outer space  
In your face  
Just don't forget  
I'll always be there  
In your face  
  
That's right  
I'm the man  
That's right, curly  
That's right  
I'm the ace

I'm losing power and I don't know why  
Not really sure if I'll live or die  
I want to leave but I can't get away  
  
It's a strange sensation  
Out of control being by myself  
I feel this gravitation  
Caught like a magnet and I'm being pulled  
  
Into the void  
I want to get away, get away  
Into the void  
I'm being pulled, I'm being pulled down  
Into the void  
This place is spinning, spinning around  
Into the void  
Fell like I'm being pulled into a black hole  
  
This crazy feeling's screwing with my head  
I'm overloading and my gauges are red  
State of confusion's got a hold on me  
  
I feel a hesitation  
I'm being drawn, falling right off the track  
Don't like the situation  
Caught like a magnet and I'm being pulled  
  
Into the void  
I want to get away, get away  
Into the void  
My head is spinning, spinning around 'round  
Into the void  
This force is getting, gettin' stronger  
Into the void  
Fell like I'm being pulled into a black hole  
Into the void  
  
I'm being pulled, being pulled down down down  
  
Into the void  
Don't like this feeling, I'm being pulled down  
Into the void  
I want to get away, get away  
Into the void  
Feel like it's spinning, spinning around  
Into the void  
I'm being pulled, being pulled down down down  
Into the void  
Get away, get away  
Into the void  
Fell like I'm being pulled into a black hole  
Into the void

Cat's droolin' on the bar stool, shake your hips and crack your whips  
Cheap seventeen and trashed out, you went too far, been a bitch you are  
Your reputation's in the bathroom, it's on the wall and down the hall  
I hear you're cheatin' with my teacher after school, tell me what you do  
When you know, you always get the boys you like  
Play nice, then stick them with your knife, take off your insecure disguise  
  
Is that you, crawlin' up my stairs, is that you  
(Is that you, crawlin' up my stairs) Is that you, lookin' half way dead  
  
Write on the mirror with your lipstick, much too vain, got scattered brains  
You used me just enough to get off, act your age, get off your stage  
  
When you know, you always get the boys you like  
Play nice, then stick them with your knife, take off your insecure disguise  
  
[Chorus:]  
Is that you, crawlin' up my stairs, is that you  
(Is that you, crawlin' up my stairs)  
Is that you, lookin' half way dead, is that you  
(Is that you, lookin' half way dead) Is that you, with your long black hair  
  
You always get the boys you like, play nice, then stick them with your knife  
You always get the boys you like, play nice, then stick them with your knife  
Take off your insecure disguise

Want it  
You can have it  
Come and take it  
I don't need it  
Power and possessions  
Never quiet your obsessions  
  
Outside, we search for something  
Inside, we still have nothing  
People deep in trouble  
Let their money run for double  
Outside, they search for something  
Inside, they still have nothing  
It never ends  
  
There's nothing I can do  
There's nothing I can say  
And even if I could  
And even if I would  
It Never Goes Away  
Yeah  
  
Heartless rich and greedy  
Watch the churches rape the needy  
While we pray for salvation  
Preachers yield to temptation  
It never ends  
  
There's nothing I can do  
There's nothing I can say  
And even if I could  
And even if I would  
It Never Goes Away  
There's nothing I can do  
There's nothing I can say  
And even if I could  
And even if I would  
It Never Goes Away  
  
Blinded believers and doomsday deceivers  
Are driving you out of your head  
Look in the mirror, the answer is near  
Though your sanity hangs by a thread  
  
There's nothing I can do  
There's nothing I can say  
And even I could  
And even I would  
It Never Goes Away  
There's nothing I can do  
There's nothing I can say  
And even if I could  
And even if I would  
It Never Goes Away

I gotta reputation,  
People know who I am.  
Rules are made to be broken,  
Can't kill what you don't understand.  
I see you runnin' scared,  
I never knew you cared.  
Go and hide yourself in the sand.  
Been to hell and back.  
I survived and that's a fact.  
(Chorus)  
It's my life.  
And I'll do what I wanna  
Do what I wanna,  
Do what I like.  
It's my life  
And I'll do what I wanna,  
Do what I wanna - do.  
My New Year's resolution,  
Is a always the same.  
Gonna do what I like,  
We're gonna do what I want,  
Cause it's just my way,  
Yeah!  
I don't live for tomorrow,  
Cause at the end of the day.  
Gonna shout it, from the roof.  
Betta face up to the truth.  
(Chorus)(Repeat twice)  
Ooh yeah!  
(Break)  
Don't need a invitation,  
I don't play hard-to-get.  
No!  
Well I'm fame they claim,  
I can't be tamed.  
Ya know it doesn't matter.  
I swear if I like,  
I wear what I want.  
(Chorus) (Repeat five times)

How many times have they lied with the truth in their eyes  
Treat you like dirt, wasting the days of our lives  
They try and deny it, ain't gonna buy it, just look around  
Before it's all over, it's gonna get rough  
  
I've had enough -  
  
Chorus:  
(Out of the cold into the fire) Nothing and no one is stopping me now  
(Out of the cold into the fire) Just hang tough and we'll make it somehow  
  
How many times have you given up more than you got  
Countin' on things turnin' out, but you know they will not  
Ain't gonna take it, kick it and break it, just look around  
Before it's all over it's gonna get rough  
  
Chorus repeats 2x  
  
Wishin' and hopin' won't get you nothin'  
Prayin' and schemin', no time for dreamin'  
I've got the power, this is the hour now  
  
Wishin' and hopin' won't get you nothin'  
Prayin' and schemin', no time for dreamin'  
I've got the power, this is the hour now  
  
Chorus repeats 2x

I know just where you come from  
Where all your yesterday's are gone  
And now you're done  
But you've only just begun  
It's time you opened up the door  
  
And now it's all very clear  
This journey of a thousand years  
  
Can you feel it coming  
Can you feel it now  
Can you feel it coming  
Or is it the roar of the crowd  
Can you feel it coming  
Can you hear it  
Or is it the roar of the crowd  
  
Did you sleep without dreams  
Did you fly without wings  
Did you touch without feel  
Where nothing is real  
Did you feel it coming  
Did you hear it  
Or was it the roar of the crowd

JUNGLE  
Here I go  
Down below  
The sun is goin' down  
A Jungle comes alive  
The beast is waking up  
To take another life  
  
I can't sleep  
In too deep  
The man with nothing left  
Without a place to hide  
Will take a final breath  
And tumble in the night  
Yeah  
  
Someone's safe at home  
Someone dies alone  
Someone's fallen prey  
Yeah  
  
Some will take their fill  
Like lions to the kill  
Livin' day to day  
Whoa,  
The Jungle  
  
Mothers mourn  
Fathers groan  
The child takes a hit  
And then he starts to cry  
A mother never hears  
Her baby's last goodbye  
Yeah  
  
Someone's safe at home  
Someone dies alone  
Someone's fallen prey  
Yeah  
  
Some will take their fill  
Like lions to the kill  
Livin' day to day  
Whoa,  
The Jungle  
  
The sun is coming up  
A city comes alive  
The lamb will never see  
A Jungle in the sky  
Yeah  
  
Someone's safe at home  
Someone dies alone  
Someone's falling prey  
Yeah  
  
Some will take their fill  
Like lions to the kill  
Livin' day to day  
Yeah  
  
Someone dies alone  
Someone's safe at home  
All is flesh and bone  
Whoa,  
The Jungle

I know what you're like  
You're not sleepin' at night  
I know you're losing control  
I know your plans  
  
Where you're keeping your hands  
I know it's taking its toll  
Sweet little innocent girl  
Making your way in this world  
  
Something you're feeling tonight  
Tells you what's wrong and what's right  
You gotta keep me comin' (keep me comin')  
Keep me comin' (keep me comin')  
  
You gotta keep me comin' (keep me comin')  
Keep me comin' babe (keep me comin')  
Hands on my shoulders now  
You're getting bolder  
  
Your fears are slipping away  
Each little bite lets me know that you're ripe  
You're thinking maybe you'll stay  
Now that you're burning to know  
  
How far you're willing to go  
Now that it's under your skin  
Now that you're lettin' me in  
You gotta keep me comin'...  
  
Ooh yeah, comin', comin'  
Ooh yeah, right here, right now  
You gotta keep me comin'...

Look what you're doing, I'm losing my mind  
My head's in a ruin, leaving me behind  
It hurts to believe you could treat me so cruel  
Pick me up, put me down, make me look like a fool  
  
Keep me waiting  
Keep me waiting  
Keep me waiting  
Keep me waiting  
  
Look what you're doing, I'm losing this time  
I thought you were true and I see I was blind  
It hurts to believe you could treat me so cruel  
Pick me up, put me down, make me look like a fool  
  
Keep me waiting  
Keep me waiting  
Keep me waiting  
Keep me waiting  
  
It doesn't matter what you do or say  
I know goodbye is coming any day  
It doesn't matter what you do or say  
I know goodbye is coming any day  
It doesn't matter what you do or say  
I know goodbye is coming any day  
  
Keep me waiting  
Keep me waiting  
Keep me waiting  
Keep me waiting  
  
Keep me waiting, waiting, waiting  
Keep me waiting, waiting, waiting  
Keep me waiting, waiting, waiting  
Keep me waiting, waiting, waiting  
  
Keep me waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting  
Keep me waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting  
Keep me waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting  
Keep me waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting  
  
Keep me waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting

Keep me waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting  
Keep me waiting, waiting, waiting

Her love is a gun, her love is a blade, she's a killer  
Bitch is insane, she deals in pain, she's a killer  
Ooh, she'll cut you clean, then she'll watch you bleed  
So obscene, she's what I need, she loves to hear me scream

Don't want to see no tears  
Eliminate your fears

My eggs in one basket, but she threw me a bone  
She was dealt a full deck, but she likes to live alone  
Ain't just talkin' to myself, need a reason to stop (oh yeah)  
With a flower in her teeth, she drained the last drop  
I said girls love money like bees the honey  
  
But lonely is the hunter, you're my one and only, and lonely is the hunter  
  
Asked her for a refill, sweat flew off my face (oh yeah)  
She's a legendary figure, kept me in a cage  
She's a torture chamber, when I seduced her in my bed (ooh yeah)  
She gave a cold reading, success went to her head  
  
In the heat of the battle the heart cannot rule, I'm such a fool  
  
But lonely is the hunter, you're my one and only, and lonely is the hunter  
Lonely is the hunter, you're my one and only, and lonely is the hunter  
  
Lonely is the hunter, you're my one and only, and lonely is the hunter  
Lonely is the hunter, you're my one and only, and lonely is the hunter

I remember the times I was lonely without her  
Now she's mine and I spend my times dreamin' about her  
  
Love her all I can and try to understand  
The things that make her glad  
The things that make her sad  
I'm a lucky guy, I hardly ever cry  
And when the world looks bad  
She's never ever sad  
  
She's so easy to please and it doesn't take money, no, no  
We can have a good time when the skies aren't sunny  
  
Ah, I love her all I can and try to understand  
The things that make her glad  
The things that make her sad  
I'm a lucky guy, I hardly ever cry  
And when the world looks bad  
She's never ever sad  
  
Whoo  
I remember the times I was lonely without her  
Now she's mine and I spend my time dreamin' about her  
  
I love her all I can and try to understand  
The things that make her glad  
The things that make her sad  
I'm a lucky guy, I hardly ever cry  
And when the world looks bad  
She's never ever sad

I see you walkin' down the street  
You're turnin' into paradise  
The boys are crawlin' at your feet  
Burn them and turn them to ice  
No one gets a piece of your heart  
It's over 'cause you won't let it start  
You keep your love in chains, love in chains  
And only fear remains and keeps your love in chains  
But isn't it time (enough), isn't it time (enough)  
Oh yeah  
  
They know you feel just like a queen  
Baby, are you havin' life  
But all the things they'd never seen  
Stab at your heart like a knife  
  
No one knows the way that you love

I walk the streets by day, I never know quite what to say  
It doesn't matter anyway  
Man of a 1000 faces, man of a 1000 faces, man of a 1000 faces, who's the man  
  
For years I've lived inside my dreams  
Somehow I've made them real, it seems  
I made my own rules, because I am a  
  
Man of a 1000 faces, man of a 1000 faces, man of a 1000 faces, who's the man  
  
I can put on any face, you all know me, but it's no disgrace  
The king of night, he understands  
  
Man of a 1000 faces, man of a 1000 faces, man of a 1000 faces, who's the man  
Who's the man of a 1000 faces, who's the man of a 1000 faces  
Who's the man of a 1000 faces, who's the man  
  
I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man  
I'm the man of a 1000 faces, I'm the man of a 1000 faces  
I'm the man of a 1000 faces, I'm the man  
I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man (to fade)  

I still remember when I saw your face across the room  
Told me to take you but the price of love would seal my doom  
  
I know the way you made the others break  
But loving me would be your first mistake  
  
Slave away, slave away  
Modern day Delilah  
Each time you learn to give  
Queen to slave  
Modern day Delilah  
  
Listen  
  
You lived your glory in a liars haze you called the truth  
The same old story of a social plan from wasted youth  
  
You thought that you could bring me to my knees  
But who's the one who's crying baby please  
  
Slave away, slave away  
Modern day Delilah  
Each time you learn to give  
Queen to slave  
Modern day Delilah  
  
Just like the trigger of a loaded gun  
You were the reason for the damage done  
Too many lovers like a hunters prey  
Not today  
  
I know the way you made the others break  
But loving me would be your last mistake  
Each time you learn to give  
  
Slave away

Better run for cover, babe, she's gonna make her move  
You know she could, she's a get rich bitch  
You better get her while the gettin's good  
  
She's a vision in leather, like salt on a wound  
Just a turn of a knob and she's real fine tuned

Well you're playin' with the fire, a pool of sweat's lyin' on the floor  
She'll bring you to your knees, and when you're laid to rest

Oh the heat is on, and my back's against the wall  
You know it's tough to be strong, in a world that makes you crawl  
I'm never gonna stop, I'm never gonna give up in the fight

I'm gonna talk like I talk, walk like I walk my way  
I'm gonna go where I go, ain't takin' no my way  
  
Here in the danger zone, it's a jagged edge we climb  
But if you take it like stone, and stand on your own  
You can make the grade in time  
I'm never gonna run, I'm never gonna tell myself a lie  
Cause after it's all said and done, I won't be wonderin' why  
And I'll know that under the gun, I am the one who's got the right to decide  
  
I'm gonna talk like I talk, walk like I walk my way  
I'm gonna go where I go, ain't takin' no my way  
  
And if you don't play my game I won't play, I'm gonna do it my way

Many years since I was here, on the street I was passin' my time away  
To the left and to the right, buildings towering to the sky  
It's outta sight in the dead of night  
Here I am, again in this city, with a fistful of dollars  
And baby, you'd better believe  
  
Chorus:  
I'm back, back in the New York Groove  
I'm back, back in the New York Groove  
I'm back, back in the New York Groove  
Back in the New York Groove, in the New York Groove  
  
In the back of my Cadillac  
A wicked lady, sittin' by my side, sayin' 'Where are we? '  
Stop at Third and Forty-three, exit to the night  
It's gonna be ecstacy, this place was meant for me  
  
Feels so good tonight, who cares about tomorrow  
So baby, you'd better believe  
  
Chorus

When you knew that his love was through  
You closed your eyes instead

From a far off galaxy, I hear you calling me  
We are on an odyssey  
Through the realms of time and space  
In that enchanted place  
You and I come face to face  
  
Once upon not yet, long ago someday  
Countless times we've met, met along the way  
  
Through the luminescent night  
On beams of neon light  
You and I in winged flight  
As we cross the starry sea, powered by what we see  
Now and then, the victory  
  
There's a child in a sun-dress  
Looking at a rainy sky  
There's a place in the desert  
Where an ocean once danced by  
There's a song in the silence  
Weaving in and out of time  
We are notes in the music  
Searching for remembered rhyme  
  
On a mountain high somewhere  
Where only heroes dare  
Stand the stallion and the mare  
We have been and we shall be each other's destiny  
One another's odyssey  
  
There's a child in a sun-dress  
Looking at a rainy sky  
There's a place in the desert  
Where an ocean once did lie  
There's a song in the silence  
Weaving in and out of time  
We are notes in the music  
Searching for remembered rhyme  
  
We've met along the way  
We've met along the way

Only you have the answers  
But the questions you have to find  
Only you know the secrets  
But the truth lies deep in your mind  
Only you are the answer  
You turn the night into day, yeah  
Only you are the man-child  
You are the light and you are the way  
  
Tell me the secrets  
I want to know  
Tell me the secrets  
I want to know  
Only you  
  
Only you are the man-child  
You are the light and you are the way  
  
I can't believe this is is true  
Why do I listen to you  
If I am all that you say  
Why am I still so afraid  
  
Only you  
Only you  
Only you  
  
In every age  
In every time  
A hero is born  
As if by a grand design

I'm the kind of guy who likes feelin' high  
Feelin' high and dry, and I really like to fly  
I'm your kinda guy, girl I'm not too shy  
And I want you to fly, so I think you oughta try  
Ozone, ozone, ozone, ozone

Feelin' high and dry, and I want you to be mine  
So I think it's time, girl, to start feeling fine  
Feeling good all the time, so I think you oughta try  
  
Ozone, ozone, ozone, ozone  
  
Now I'm the kinda guy who likes getting high  
Getting high and dry, and I do it all the time  
If you think it's a crime and you don't wanna try  
Something that'll make you high, then I think I'll say goodbye  
  
'Cos I'm the kind of guy who likes getting high  
Getting high and dry, and I do it all the time  
Now I'm much too high, I am high and dry  
And I'm feelin' fine, I'm feelin' good all of the time... (to fade)

Who cares, I'm in a trance, I got no hope, I don't stand a chance  
But it's all right, yes it's all right  
Who knows, well I don't care, 'cause I don't fit in anywhere  
But it's all right, yes it is all right  
Well, I'm numb but that's my style,  
I've been numb for a little while  
And it's all right, yes it's all right  
I checked out yesterday, well there's nothing left to say  
But it's all right, yes it's all right  
Don't see nothin' in my eyes, 'cause man I've been lobotomized  
Cold inside, anesthetized, 'cause life has got me paralyzed  
Who says I have to pay, I didn't want this anyway  
But it's all right, yes it's all right  
Who says life is good? Love thyself, well I never could  
But it's all right, yes it is all right  
I'm here dressed in black, waiting for a heart attack  
But it's all right, yes it's all right  
I try to talk, I just can't speak, the urge is strong,  
But my brain is weak  
And it's all right, yes it's all right  
Don't see nothin' in my eyes, 'cause man I've been lobotomized  
Cold inside, anesthetized, 'cause life has got me paralyzed  
And who says life is good? Love thyself, well I never could  
But it's all right, yes it's all right  
I checked out yesterday, well there's nothing left to say  
But it's all right, yes it's all right  
Don't see nothin' in my eyes, 'cause man I've been lobotomized,  
I'm paralyzed  
Cold inside, anesthetized, yeah, I'm feelin' otherwise,  
I'm paralyzed  
Don't see nothin' in my eyes, 'cause man I've been lobotomized,  
I'm paralyzed  
Cold inside, anesthetized, yeah, I'm feelin' otherwise,  
I'm paralyzed

Alright  
I know your wheels are turning, got your fire burning  
I know your heart's as cold as stone  
You're covered in abuses, dripping with excuses  
I know you got a lover at home  
  
But you'll come here to me, time after time  
You'll go down on your knees  
Yeah girl I can read your mind  
Because we're partners in crime, partners in crime  
  
Your going empty handed, smiling like a bandit  
Knocking on my window each night  
You're sweeter than a beauty queen, darker than a limousine  
Need me cause I feel right  
  
Yeah when it's sink or it's swim and the temperature flies  
You get your body so close and lay it all on the line  
Because we're partners in crime, partners in crime  
Because we're partners in crime, ooh yeah  
  
When it's sink or swim and the tale's that's you're blind  
You get your body so close and lay it all on the line  
Because we're partners in crime, partners in crime  
Ooh yeah, because we're partners in crime  
Because we're partners in crime  
Partners in crime, partners in crime

Oh, things are complicating, my love is in her hands  
And there's no more waiting, she understands

If I can survive, and if you can't deny it  
Don't give me love, no, don't even try it  
Just give me your trust, and I'll tell you no lies  
This is the truth, and I don't know why  
  
Can't you hear your heart is beatin' (Don't you hear it beatin')  
Don't you feel that sweet sweet feelin' (Can't you feel that feelin')  
Anytime you need some lovin'

Yeah, yes I know, but here comes that feelin' again  
  
And if you can't believe all your alibis, I can tell by that look in your eyes  
When we make love, you play hard to bet, you bet, what you give is what you
get  
  
Anytime I see you goin' (Anytime I see you gone)  
Everytime the feelin's growin' (This feelin's growin')  
Anytime I need your lovin'  
  
Yeah, I know, I'm a prisoner of love, and I can't break these chains  
Yeah, yes I know, but here comes that feelin' again  
I know it's much too late, but I can't help this feelin', no I can't look away

Would you want to know what I'm thinking about  
Do you wonder do I want to make you scream and shout - shout it out  
Would you like to see what's in my brain  
Does your curiosity make you insane - insane  
  
Baby you're just wastin' precious time, if you want to know what's on my mind  
  
Read my body, are the letters big enough  
Read my body, do you like the book of my love  
Read my body, turn the page, get to the good stuff, read my body  
  
Would you like to go on a moonlight ride  
Do you think you want to show me what you're like inside  
Would you like to touch, do you want to know  
How good it can get, how far it can go - ooh, let's go, let's go  
  
Baby if you're lost between the lines, open up your eyes and see the signs  
  
Read my body, are the letters big enough

Read my body, turn the page, get to the good stuff, read my body

Out of love, there's nobody around, all I hear is the sound of a broken heart  
Out of time, no more waitin' for you  
Now the hurtin's through, and a new day starts  
And I feel a change in my life, I sailed into dark and endless nights  
And made it alive  
  
Everybody's got a reason to live, baby  
Everybody's got a dream and a hunger inside  
Everybody's got a reason to live, but it can't be your love  
  
Out of touch, with myself for so long, now a feelin' so strong comin' over me  
Down the line, there's a lesson I've learned  
You can love and get burned, if it has to be  
And I see a change in my life, and I'm not alone when I'm strong inside  
And I realize  
  
Everybody's got a reason to live, baby  
Everybody's got a dream and a hunger inside  
Everybody's got a reason to live, but it can't be your love  
  
And I feel a change in my life  
And I'm not alone when I'm strong inside and I realize  
  
Everybody's got a reason to live, baby  
Everybody's got a dream and a hunger inside  
Everybody's got a reason to live, but it can't be your love  
  
Everybody's got a reason to live, baby  
Everybody's got a dream and a hunger inside  
Everybody's got a reason to live, but it can't be your love  
  
No it can't be your love, no it can't be your love  
No it can't be your love

Now I know, you've been cheatin' and lyin' all the time  
I didn't know you were gonna be so unkind  
I've been trying just to find out how we went wrong  
But I know that I can't trust you girl anymore  
  
Rip it out, take my heart, you wanted it from the start  
You got it now, so goodbye, so rip it out, watch me cry  
  
It's so sad, I'm not glad to be with you today  
And it's bad, 'cause I can't stop the pain day by day  
If I knew how to stop you, I don't think I'd try  
I think it's better if we just part and don't say goodbye  
  
Rip it out, take my heart, you wanted it from the start  
You got it now, so goodbye, so rip it out, watch me cry  
  
I hope you suffer!  
  
Rip it out, take my heart, you wanted it from the start  
You got it now, so goodbye, so rip it out, watch me cry  
  
Rip it out, take my heart, you wanted it from the start  
You got it now, so goodbye, so rip it out, watch me cry  
  
Rip it out (repeats out)

Been under fire sixteen years, just waitin' for his time to come  
He fought the lies, fought back the tears, can't wait to hear that starting
gun  
There ain't nobody gonna step on his dreams  
So he held his hands high and screamed  
  
[Chorus:]  
Get me out of this rock and roll hell, take me far away  
Get me out of this rock and roll hell  
Get me out of this rock and roll hell, I need to get away  
Get me out of this rock and roll hell  
  
He's on the edge, he can feel it in his heart  
This time the pressure's really on  
He's gonna fight it, might even steal a guitar  
This time tomorrow he'll be gone  
There ain't nobody gonna tell him what to do  
Think he's a little like me and you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
He's on the run, won't stand for second place, but his turn may never come  
He's not a victim, you can see it in his face  
But he can't see what he's become  
Well, he wants it bad, but he wants no charity  
He seems to think it's his destiny  
  
Get me out of this rock and roll hell, I need to get away  
Get me out of this rock and roll hell  
  
[Chorus]

Baby, who you been lovin' since your man's gone  
Baby, who you been seein' since your man's gone  
Tellin' all those cheap, cheap lies, you  
Hopin' that his eyes won't see through you, yeah  
Well baby, I can play it, there's something I just got to do  
I got to slumpin' and you know that it's true  
You got the sure shockin', hit rockin' movements  
You're gonna blow my blues away

I'm flyin' in a 747, I'm passing by the pearly gates  
And I'm comin' real close to Heaven  
And my guitar just can't wait, it just can't wait  
  
In France really had the chance, yeah, there was plenty romance  
I've been to England too, there wasn't much to do  
One thing I know is true, what I would rather do is  
  
Rockin' in the U.S.A.  
Nowhere else I'd rather stay  
Rockin' and a-rollin', rockin' and a-rollin'  
Rockin' in the U.S.A.

And Denmark was great, but I just can't wait, rockin' in the U.S.A.

I'm feelin' low, no place to go  
And I'm a-thinking that I'm gonna scream  
Because a hotel all alone is not a  
Rock and roll star's dream  
  
But just when I'm about to shut the light and go to bed  
A lady calls and asks if I'm too tired or if I'm just to dead for  
  
Room service, baby I could use a meal  
Room service, you do what you feel  
Room service, I take the pleasure with the pain  
I can't say no  
  
My plane's delayed and I'm afraid  
They're gonna keep me waiting here till nine  
Then a stewardess in a tight blue dress says  
"I got the time"  
  
But just as I'm about to take my coat and get my flight  
She says "Oh please", she's on her knees  
And one more time before I leave I get some  
  
Room service, baby I could use a meal  
Room service, you do what you feel  
Room service, I take the pleasure with the pain  
I can't say no, no  
  
In my home town, I'm hangin' 'round  
With all the ladies treatin' me real good  
A sweet sixteen lookin' hot and mean says  
I wish you would  
  
But just as I'm about to tell her "Yes, I think I can"  
I see her dad, he's getting mad  
All the time he knows that I'm in need of  
  
Room service, baby I could use a meal  
Room service, you do what you feel  
Room service, I take the pleasure with the pain  
I can't say no  
  
Room service, baby I could use a meal  
Room service, you do what you feel  
Room service, I take the pleasure with the pain  
I can't say no, I can't say no  
  
Room service, baby I could use a meal  
Room service, you do what you feel  
Room service, you take the pleasure with the pain  
I can't say no  
  
Room service, well maybe baby, room service

You were my woman and I was your man  
You were good lookin'  
You know I was your biggest fan  
You tried to teach me things I already knew  
When you couldn't reach me  
Girl, I think you knew that we were through  
Baby, it's over  
  
Save your love, save it, save it  
Save your love, save it, save it  
Save your love, I don't want it (save your love)  
Save it for someone else (save it, save it)  
Save your love, I don't need it (save your love)  
Put it back on the shelf  
For somebody else  
  
You said you love me, you may have been right  
But hangin' above me, girl,  
You know that we would fight  
  
You tried to change me and mess up my mind  
Now, don't rearrange me  
And girl, you know that's why you're left behind  
It's over now  
  
Save your love, save it, save it  
Save your love, save it, save it  
Save your love, I don't want it (save your love)  
Save it for someone else (save it, save it)  
Save your love, I don't need it (save your love)  
Put it back on the shelf  
For somebody else  
  
Girl, you know it's over  
We had some good times  
But now they're gone, so long  
  
Save your love, save it, save it  
Save your love, save it, save it  
Save your love, I don't want it (save your love)  
Save it for someone else (save it, save it)  
Save your love, I don't need it (save your love)  
Put it back on the shelf  
For somebody else  
  
Save your love, I don't want it (save your love)  
Save it for someone else (save it, save it)  
Save your love, I don't need it (save your love)  
Girl, I don't want it, save your love  
  
Save your love, I don't want it (save your love)  
Save it for someone else (save it, save it)  
Save your love, I don't need it (save your love)  
Girl, I don't want it, save your love  
  
Save your love, I don't want it (save your love)  
Save it for someone else (save it, save it)  
Save your love, I don't need it (save your love)  
Girl, I don't want it, save your love

He always wears his bible belt  
The collar under his head  
It's like a noose around his neck  
His sandaled feet don't touch the ground  
Ears don't hear a sound  
Seduction Of The Innocent  
  
Everybody thinks there's always a reason  
Need a reason to cry  
You kiss the hand of the man for all seasons  
And don't know why  
  
Say it friend, if you had to do it all over again  
Would you know the trickery that he's prayin?  
  
The padre looks well fed  
Remember what the good book said  
Vultures circle overhead  
Whatever gets you through the night  
Friends sing to clear your mind  
Seduction Of The Innocent  
  
Everybody thinks there's always a reason  
Need a reason to cry  
You kiss the hand of a man for all seasons  
And don't know why  
  
Say it friend, if you had to do it all over again  
Would you know the trickery that he's prayin'?  
  
Everybody thinks there's always a reason  
Need a reason to cry  
You kiss the hand of the man for all seasons  
And don't know why  
  
Say it friend, if you had to do it all over again  
Would you know the trickery that he's prayin'?

The party's over, and baby's in the corner  
She's all alone for the night  
You pick up the phone, you want to go home  
Well dry your eyes, it's alright, it's alright  
See you, feel you in your dreams tonight  
See you, feel you in your dreams tonight, dreams tonight  
  
When you're in the room, you're home too soon  
You can't get me out of your mind  
And you get in bed, you cover your head  
My letter to you is signed  
And this is what I'm sayin'  
  
See you, feel you in your dreams tonight  
See you, feel you in your dreams tonight, dreams tonight  
  
See you, see you, feel you in your dreams tonight, dreams tonight  
See you, see you, feel you in your dreams tonight, dreams tonight  
See you, see you, feel you in your dreams tonight, dreams tonight  
See you, see you, feel you in your dreams tonight, dreams tonight  
See you, see you, feel you in your dreams tonight  
See you, see you, feel you in your dreams tonight, dreams tonight  
See you, see you, feel you in your dreams tonight  
See you, see you, feel you in your dreams tonight, dreams tonight  
See you, see you, feel you in your dreams tonight  
See you, see you, feel you in your dreams tonight, dreams tonight

I just can't pretend no more, I keep runnin' out of lies  
Lovin' you is killin' me inside  
Every time I find the words to end it, something in your eyes won't let it  
  
[Chorus:]  
Shandi, tonight must last us forever,  
Forever we say goodnight and go home  
But you know me very well, and I know you,  
You can't tell me goodnight  
(say goodnight)  
  
We been holding on so tight, we're afraid to let it go  
Shake it loose, we both could use the ride  
Here's another mess I got myself in, and when you touch me you ain't helpin'  
  
[Chorus]  
Say goodnight when we should say goodbye (say goodbye)  
  
(Shandi, Shandi) Tonight must last us forever and ever  
Forever we say goodnight and go home  
Shandi, Shandi, tonight must last us forever

She walks by moonlight  
No one really knows  
Enchanted starlight  
Never goin' home  
I know she's goin' down, goin'  
Everybody knows, she's so good  
  
Doin' well for others  
She doesn't really know  
The powers are within her  
As she takes off her clothes  
I know she's goin' down, goin'  
Everybody knows, she's so good  
  
Doin' well for others  
She doesn't really know  
The powers are within her  
As she takes off her clothes  
I know she's goin' down, goin'  
Everybody knows, she's so good

She walked in like a lady, with a glass of pink champagne  
I wouldn't look if you paid me, 'cause to me she's still the same  
Well you oughtta see her, wearin' her heart on her sleeves  
You'd never believe her, she's got a well-planned look in her eyes  
  
She's so European, she's one of a kind, one of a kind  
She's so European, she's one of a kind, all in her mind  
And she's so European, I found out today  
  
She still speaks with an accent from a week in San Tropez  
She makes love on her brass bed 'cause her parents are still away  
Well you oughta see her, countin' the stars in her eyes  
You'd never believe her, she's got a well-planned coverless smile  
  
She's so European, she's one of a kind, all in her mind  
She's so European, she's one of a kind, all in her mind  
And she's so European, she told me today  
  
I wanna hold her tight all through the night, I must be dreamin'  
I wanna take my time, she's so refined, is that her screamin'  
  
I've seen the looks in your eyes, you've seen through her disguise, yeah  
  
She's so European, she's so European, one of a kind, all in her mind...

Your lightnin's all I need  
My satisfaction grows  
You make me feel at ease  
You even make me glow  
Don't cut the power on me  
I'm feelin' low, so get me high  
  
Shock me, make me feel better  
Shock me, put on your black leather  
Shock me, we can come together  
  
And baby, if you do what you've been told  
My insulation's gone, girl you make me overload  
  
Don't pull the plug on me, no, no  
Keep it in and keep me high  
  
Shock me, make me feel better  
Shock me, put on your black leather  
Shock me, we can come together  
Come on  
  
Shock me, baby, shock me, oh yeah  
Shock me, baby, shock me, oh yeah  
  
Shock me, make me feel better, oh yeah  
Come on and shock me, put on your black leather  
Baby, I'm down to the bare wire  
Shock me, we can come together  
Oh yeah, I wanna feel your power  
Shock me, make me feel better  
Baby, I'm down to the bare wire  
Shock me, put on your black leather  
Baby, come on, come on, shock me

I don't want a lover's heartache  
I don't need nobody's sympathy  
So come on get the party started  
All I need is lying next to me  
  
We got our own situation  
Ready and steady to go  
Hang out, put out, get out  
That's what we're all about  
  
I wanna hear you shout mercy  
I wanna get a little crazy  
  
You got everything I'm after  
Flesh and blood just like a fantasy  
So make my heart start beating faster  
Love what is and what can never be

Hiding so nobody sees
