It coulda been me but it was you  
Who went and bit off a little bit more than he could chew  
You said that you had it made, but you been had  
The woman no good, no how, thinkin' maybe the blood is bad  
  
Bad (ba-a-ad) blood (blo-o-od)  
The woman was born to lie  
Makes promises she can't keep  
With the wink on an eye  
  
Bad (ba-a-ad) blood (blo-o-od)  
Brother, you've been deceived  
It's bound to change you mind  
About all you believe  
  
From where I stand, it looks mighty strange  
How you let a woman like that treat you like small change  
I don't understand what you're lookin' to find  
The only thing bad blood do is mess up a good man's mind  
  
Hear me talkin' now  
  
Bad (ba-a-ad) blood (blo-o-od)  
The bitch is in her smile  
The lie is on her lips  
Such an evil child  
  
Bad (ba-a-ad) blood (blo-o-od)  
Is takin' you for a ride  
The only thing good about bad blood  
Is lettin' it slide  
  
Doo-ron, doo-ron, di di, dit, dit, ron-ron  
Doo-ron, doo-ron, di di, dit, dit, ron-ron  
Doo-ron, doo-ron, di di, dit, dit, ron-ron  
Bad blood, talkin' 'bout bad blood  
  
Doo-ron, doo-ron, di di, dit, dit, ron-ron  
Doo-ron, doo-ron, di di, dit, dit, ron-ron  
Doo-ron, doo-ron, di di, dit, dit, ron-ron  
Bad blood  
Here we go  
  
Bad (ba-a-ad) blood (blo-o-od)  
The bitch is in her smile  
The lie is on her lips  
Such an evil child  
  
Bad (ba-a-ad) blood (blo-o-od)  
Is takin' you for a ride  
The only thing good about bad blood  
Is lettin' it slide  
  
The only thing good about bad blood  
Is lettin' it slide  

Walking alone, along the board walking Brighton  
The sun is high and so am I, I feel enlightened  
Mother nature's taking care of me  
Rocks me gently, naturally  
Seems like the sea was put there  
Just for me  
  
Running upon the beaches of my childhood  
I should have stayed forever, if only I could  
Coney Island on a Sunday night  
Rollercoaster rides, neon lights  
  
Me and my Brighton, baby, used to do alright  
  
La-la-la la-la-la la-la-la la-la-ran-da-a-da  
  
La-la-la la-la-la la-la-la la-la-ran-da-a-da  
  
Comes a time when eventually  
I'll have to leave here, permanently  
Now that old Brighton has become  
A part of me  
  
La-la-la la-la-la la-la-la la-la-ran-da-a-da  
  
La-la-la la-la-la la-la-la la-la-ran-da-a-da  
  
Comes a time when eventually  
I'll have to leave here, permanently  
  
Now that old Brighton has become a part of me  
Now that old Brighton has become a part of me

I love, I love, I love my calender girl  
Yeah, sweet calender girl  
I love, I love, I love my calender girl  
Each and every day of the year  
  
(January) You start the year off fine  
(February) You're my little valentine  
(March) I'm gonna march you down the aisle  
(April) You're the Easter Bunny when you smile  
Yeah, yeah, my heart's in a whirl  
I love, I love, I love my little calender girl  
Every day (every day), every day (every day) of the year  
(Every day of the year)  
  
(May) Maybe if I ask your dad and mom  
(June) They'll let me take you to the Junior Prom  
(July) Like a firecracker all aglow  
(August) When you're on the beach you steal the show  
  
Yeah, yeah, my heart's in a whirl  
I love, I love, I love my little calendar girl  
Every day (every day), every day (every day) of the year  
(Every day of the year)  
  
(September) Light the candles at your Sweet Sixteen  
(October) Romeo and Juliet on Halloween  
(November) I'll give thanks that you belong to me  
(December) You're the present 'neath my Christmas tree  
  
Yeah, yeah, my heart's in a whirl  
I love, I love, I love my little calender girl  
Every day (every day), every day (every day) of the year

My old lady she's so sweet and fine  
I can't help it wanting her kisses all the time  
I run to meet her like kid with a dollar to the corner candy store  
It's what I'm living for, but I want more than your candy kisses  
  
She starts moving I say honey please  
I ain't foolin' you know it isn't right to tease  
I tell her sugar you're a true fine lover, you're sweet as cherry pie  
But no matter how I try, I can't get by, on your candy kisses  
  
I don't want our love to stop  
If it should stop my heart would break  
If the sun should get too hot  
It's gonna melt the icing on our cake  
  
Candy kisses knock me off my feet  
Fill me up but leave me feeling incomplete  
Fancy wrappin' and well made trappins will lead me to your door  
But what I'm hungry for, is so much more  
Than your candy kisses

Nothing is real in cardboard California  
Just waking up brings you down  
One lousy deal is cardboard California  
You just can't survive in a make believe town  
  
Lost in a city of little tin gods  
Cold plastic people with phony facades  
How can you win when you look at the odds  
  
You're running down a one way street  
Nobody cares if you survive  
Sometimes you beg or you don't eat  
You gotta fight to stay alive  
Hey, you're never gonna get away  
  
Where 's the world you used to know  
Where did all the good times go  
Look around your hopes and dreams are gone  
But like a fool you still keep hanging on  
  
Come and be a movie star  
Come and drive a fancy car  
Come and see, what you really are  
  
Look in the mirror, mirrors don't lie  
You're getting older, your time's past you by  
You lost your shot to some younger guy  
  
You're running down a one way street  
Nobody cares if you survive  
Sometimes you beg or you don't eat  
You gotta fight to stay alive  
Hey, you're never gonna get away  
  
Nothing is real in cardboard California  
Just waking up brings you down  
One lousy deal is cardboard California  
You just can't survive in a make believe town

If you're feeling low down 'cause your baby left town,  
Then let me set you straight,  
If your chick's flown the coop, knocked the blues for a loop,  
Get out and circulate.  
  
Go on out and have fun, put the blues on the run,  
You'll find that living is great,  
Just pretend you're a king, balance the world on a string,  
Get out and circulate.  
  
There are plenty of fish in the deep blue sea  
Shopping around for a mate,  
Hurry on up, waste no time,  
Come on in, the water's fine.  
  
It's a star spangled world, when your flags are unfurled  
Don't underestimate,  
This advice that I give, it means wake up and live,  
Get out and circulate.  
  
There are plenty of pebbles on the beach,  
Go out and gather a few,  
You can be the cat's meow,  
Start your rock-collection now.  
  
It's a star spangled world, when your flags are unfurled  
Don't underestimate,  
This advice that I give, it means wake up and live,  
Get out and circulate.  
It's a world full of chicks, so get out and mix,  
I said that life's worth living  
So I get your kicks.  
Get out and circulate.

Country livin' really gets me down  
So I'm headin' for the lights of town  
Gonna kiss the country life goodbye  
I got myself a brand new high  
  
Funky music where the lights are bright  
Tell the ladies I'll be there tonight  
It's a paradise of push and shove  
I gotta get back to the streets I love  
  
Chorus  
I tried to fake it I couldn't make it  
Down in my soul I'm a city boy, city boy  
I tried to hide it, it's been decided  
Don't you just know I'm a city boy, boy  
Oh I gotta satisfy it  
Take me up town and let me boogie all night long  
Oh I hate the peace and quiet  
I gotta yell, I gotta shout, I gotta dance till I burn myself out  
  
I gotta be me, I gotta be free  
Welcome me home I'm a city boy, city boy  
And now I know it, well don't I show it  
Mama take a look at your city boy, city boy  
  
Music  
  
Bring it on home, bring it on home to me  
Bring it on home, bring it on home to me  
  
It's the only place I've ever been  
Where they never pull the sidewalks in  
Life's a party and you can't go wrong  
Cos Saturday night lasts a whole week long  
  
I tried to fake it I couldn't make it  
Down in my soul I'm a city boy, city boy  
I tried to hide it, it's been decided  
Don't you just know I'm a city boy, boy  
Oh I gotta satisfy it  
Take me up town and let me boogie all night long  
Oh I hate the peace and quiet  
I gotta yell, I gotta shout, I gotta dance till I burn myself out  
  
I gotta be me, I gotta be free  
Welcome me home I'm a city boy, city boy  
And now I know it, well don't I show it  
Mama take a look at your city boy, city boy

Darei dieci anni della vita mia  
per rivederti ancora accanto a me  
Farei qualunque, qualunque cosa  
per non soffrire ancora cos?  
  
Prover?, cercher?  
di poter cancellar  
ogni istante vissuto con te,  
ma i ricordi di un d?  
non mi lasciano pi?  
ormai fanno parte di me

I love, I love, I love my dinosaur pet  
Yeah, sweet dinosaur pet  
I love, I love, I love my dinosaur pet  
Each and every day of the year  
January, he's breaking out of his shell  
February, he's body's starting to swell  
March, at least eight times a day he's got to be fed  
April, when he sleeps with me he crushes the bed  
Yeah, yeah, how big can he get  
I love, I love, I love my little dinosaur pet  
Every day, every day, every day, every day of the year  
Every day of the year  
May, maybe if the roof was twice as tall  
June, he wouldn't bump it when he's roaming the hall  
July, like the fireworks he touches the sky  
August, the cost of groceries is bleeding us dry  
Yeah, yeah, how big can he get  
I love, I love, I love my little dinosaur pet  
Every day, every day, every day, every day of the year  
Every day of the year  
Yeah, yeah, how big can he get  
I love, I love, I love my little dinosaur pet  
Every day, every day, every day, every day of the year  
Every day of the year  
September, just the tail alone is thirty feet long  
October, when we trick or treat he goes as King Kong  
November, fifty turkeys weren't nearly enough  
December, come the new year days are gonna get rough  
Yeah, yeah, how big can he get  
I love, I love, I love my little dinosaur pet  
Every day, every day, every day, every day of the year  
Every day of the year  
I love, I love, I love my little dinosaur pet  
Yeah, sweet dinosaur pet

I love, I love, I love my little dinosaur pet  

Oh please don't, don't lead me on,  
Don't love me tonight if tomorrow you'll be gone.  
If you don't mean the things that you say,  
You only have to tell me and I'll be on my way.  
  
Oh don't, don't make me cry,  
Don't say that you care if your love is just a lie.  
Don't build my hopes up to the sky.  
Please don't, don't lead me on.  
  
If, if you're gonna hurt me,  
Then please, please don't make me wait.  
Should we part, I'll get along somehow,  
So if you're gonna break my heart  
Then come on, break it now.  
  
But don't, don't lead me on,  
Don't love me tonight if tomorrow you'll be gone.  
If you don't mean the things that you say,  
Please don't, don't lead me on.  
  
If you don't mean the things that you say,  
Oh don't, don't lead me on.

I got the feeling I'm fallin'  
Like a star up in the blue  
Like I was fallin off Niagra  
In a paddle boat canoe  
I got the feeling I'm a fallin'  
And it's all because of you  
Like I was walking on a tight rope  
Swinging in the breeze  
And though I tried to keep my balance  
When I weaken in my knees  
I got the feeling I'm a fallin'  
Lover, help me please  
Like a leaf falls from the branch  
Like a rock from an avalanche  
Like the rain on a stormy day  
I never thought I'd fall this way  
I thought that love could never touch me  
Yeah, I was riding high  
And then my ivory tower toppled  
And I tumbled from the sky  
I got the feeling that I'm fallin  
And you're the reason why  
Like a life that he married for  
Like the walls of Jericho  
Like Delilah's holy town  
And Samson tore it down  
I thought that love could never touch me  
Yeah, I was riding high  
And then my ivory tower toppled  
And I tumbled from the sky  
I got the feeling that I'm fallin  
And you're the reason why

Fly don't fly on me,  
fly around somebody new.  
Fly don't fly on me,  
your buzzing and your humming is making me blue.  
I can't sleep at night,  
I toss and turn with all of my might,  
knowing you are there,  
you'll take my dreams and turn my dreams into a nightmare.  
When I go to sleep  
I don't count the sheep,  
I just think about my sweetie-pie.  
Then you fly on me,  
oh what misery.  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  
you mess me up and wake me up so I wanna cry.  
  
Fly don't fly on me,  
fly so I can dream all night.  
Fly don't fly on me  
and when you go away I'll see her holding me tight,  
'cause in my dreams I know she's gonna treat me so right.  
When I go to sleep  
I don't count the sheep,  
I just think about my sweetie-pie.  
Then you fly on me,  
oh what misery,  
ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  
you mess me up and wake me up so I wanna cry.  
  
Fly don't fly on me,  
fly so I can dream all night.  
Fly don't fly on me  
and when you go away I'll see her holding me tight,  
'cause in my dreams I know she's gonna treat me so right.  
Fly don't fly on me, shoo..........  
Fly don't fly on me, shoo............

Away... Away  
  
I just can't wait to fall asleep  
I can't wait for night each day  
'Cause when the lights are low  
No matter where you go,  
You're only forty winks  
Away... Away  
  
No matter how far you may be,  
Believe me darling when I say,  
The oceans in between  
I cross them on a dream  
'Cause you're just forty winks  
Away... Away  
  
There's a land of enchantment  
Just beyond my pillowcase,  
And I go there 'cause I know there  
I'll be in your sweet embrace.  
  
So till you come back home again,  
Until you're in my arms to stay,  
It's kinda nice to know,  
I turn the lights down low,  
And you're just forty winks  
Away... Away...  
[Fade out]  
Away... Away

I'll show you the stars in heaven,  
We'll look at the moon above.  
Though I'm a silly dreamer, you better stick with me.  
The best things in life are free,  
And I'm gonna be your good time man.  
I'll be your good time man.  
  
No diamonds from Cartier,  
No shopping spree every day.  
I'll be your special lover, I know you'll understand,  
I'm doing the best I can  
And you'll be the one in wonderland.  
I'll be your good time man.  
  
Lee, I love you so, so much you'll never, never know,  
I have a special master plan,  
I'll be your good time man.  
  
No pad on Fifth Avenue,  
No carriage ride just for two,  
No table at Twenty One,  
We're gonna have ourselves some fun.  
  
No presents from Tiffany,  
Oh baby, that's not for me.  
No Rainbow Room at night, we'll just do it right,  
Doing it naturally  
And I do it good, you know I can,  
I'll be your good time man.  
  
Lee, I love you so, so much you'll never, never, never know,  
I have a special master plan,  
I'll be your good time man.  
  
No fancy things from Chanel,  
I think that you just look swell.  
You are my special girl.  
I'm gonna take you round the world.  
  
A circle line round New York,  
Through Central Park we will walk.  
We'll hang out at the Boat House, take a paddle ride,  
We'll do it up in style,  
And I'm gonna make you smile, I can,  
I'll be your good time man.  
  
No Phantom of the Opera, not for me,  
I like Coney Island by the sea.  
French fries at Nathan's, not Grenouille.  
You're gonna see the real me.  
I'll be your good time man,  
I'll be your good time man,  
I'll be your good

Gonna sing a song, gonna be a love song  
Sing about the good good feeling you brought along  
You put my mind at rest  
Made me feel like I'd been blessed  
With good time, good music and good good friends  
  
When I was feeling down, when I was feeling low down  
You turned me on to good good music  
You turned me right around  
You took be to your breast  
You held me up with your sweet caress  
And good times, good music and good good friends  
  
I remember when you found me  
I was hungry and alone  
First you fed me then you loved me  
You made me feel at home  
  
Wanna sing a song, got to be a love song  
Sing about the good good feeling you brought along  
Wanna scream and shout  
How did I ever do without  
Good times, good music and good good friends  
  
Music  
  
Wanna scream and shout  
How did I ever do without  
Good times, good music and good good friends

If we should smile with sweet surprise  
It's just that you've grown up before our very eyes

In love so many fall but rarely do we rise in love  
We sing the saddest song,  
Lamenting to ourselves how bad we feel when love goes wrong  
I know I've been in love so many many times before  
And swore to all my friends  
That I would never never fall in love again  
  
Chorus  
And here we are falling in love again  
Who'd ever believe we could  
After all the many heavy falls  
Why should it feel so good  
Here we are falling in love again  
I still can't believe it's true  
Here we are falling in love  
And there's nothing we can do  
  
In dreams I often see a never ending kind of love  
That glides on golden wings  
Above the everyday affairs and ordinary things  
In love so many fall from dizzy heights of fantasy  
To find their love in flames  
So very sure that it was nothing more than just a game  
  
And here we are falling in love again  
Who'd ever believe we could  
After all the many heavy falls  
Why should it feel so good  
Here we are falling in love again  
I still can't believe it's true  
Here we are falling in love  
And there's nothing we can do  
  
Music  
  
And here we are falling in love again  
Who'd ever believe we could  
After all the many heavy falls  
Why should it feel so good  
Here we are falling in love again  
I still can't believe it's true  
Here we are falling in love  
And there's nothing we can do  
  
And here we are falling in love again  
Who'd ever believe we could  
After all the many heavy falls  
Why should it feel so good  
Here we are falling in love again  
I still can't believe it's true  
Here we are falling in love  
And there's nothing we can do

I AM A SONG  
  
I'm a song and I've waited so long  
For someone to come and sing me  
I got a rhyme that I've had for some time  
Nobody wants to sing me  
  
Let me show, the world, that I'm, not through  
Let me touch, your heart, the way I used to do  
  
Sing me, sing me, now I got a song to be sung  
Sing me, sing me, roll me around on your tongue  
  
I got sunshine, I got a message to shout  
Sing me, sing me, won't someone please let me out  
  
Could I make you smile if I came back in style?  
Tell me would you want to sing me?  
Don't say I'm gone, never more to live on  
Somebody's got to sing me  
  
Let me fill , the air, with my, old song  
If I let, you down, tell me where did I go wrong  
  
Sing me, sing me, I got a song to be sung (yes I do)  
Sing me, sing me, roll me around on your tongue  
  
I got sunshine, I got a message to shout  
Sing me, sing me, won't someone please let me out  
  
I got music, I will share  
I got music, now somebody cares, cares

You kissed my lips and now my life has just begun  
As far as I'm concerned you'll always be number one  
Your kiss convinced me that my roving days are done  
I belong to you  
  
You came into my life just like a melody  
And lingered in the very heart and soul of me  
If you could open up my heart then you would see  
I belong to you  
  
I found my heaven when I found you  
Please tell me that you found your heaven too  
Wo oh oh oh oh  
  
Oh, can't you see I offer you a love sincere  
I tingle every single time you hold me near  
One look into my eyes will make it very clear  
I belong to you  
  
I found my heaven when I found you  
Please tell me that you found your heaven too  
Wo oh oh oh oh  
  
Oh, can't you see I offer you a love sincere  
I tingle every single time you hold me near  
One look into my eyes will make it very clear  
I belong to you

I believe that nothing lasts forever  
Promises won't help us stay together  
Life for us was never hearts and flowers my friend  
  
It seems we couldn't solve lifes problems  
Maybe it's because we tried so seldom  
So much must change today  
That I can only hope and pray  
  
[Chorus:]  
As I watch you leave the room that I'll see you very soon  
And it's all that I can do to keep from running after you  
And though I wanted you  
I let you walk away  
  
It's just a simple case of heartache  
My hands begin to tremble and my knees shake  
Somewhere along the line I hope we can make amends  
  
I believe that nothing lasts forever  
Promises won't help us stay together  
You may come home one day  
'Til then I only hope and pray  
  
[Chorus]

I capricci tuoi son cose ridicole  
Tu distruggerai il amore per te!  
Scendi scendi scendi gi? Dalle nuvole,  
Non restar lass? Lontano da me  
Sapessi quanti amori sono finiti cos?,  
Perch? Annegarono tra tante lacrime per un capriccio.  
Ritorna quella bimba che sorrideva per me:  
? Tanto semplice, ? Tanto facile volersi bene  
Amore  
I capricci tuoi son cose ridicole  
Tu distruggerai il mio amore per te  
Bada che I bei giorni poi non ritornano,  
Non scherzare con l'amore mai pi?,  
Mai pi?  
.. .. ..  
Sapessi quanti amori sono finiti cos?,  
Perch? Annegarono tra tante lacrime per un capriccio.  
Ritorna quella bimba che sorrideva per me:  
? Tanto semplice, ? Tanto facile volersi bene  
Amore.  
I capricci tuoi son cose ridicole  
Tu distruggerai il mio amore per te  
Bada che I bei giorni poi non ritornano,  
Non scherzare con l'amore mai pi?,  
Mai pi?...  
I capricci tuoi...  
I capricci tuoi...  
You-you you-you you-you you-you  
[sfumando]  
I capricci tuoi...

I waited too long, and now we're apart.  
I never told you what I feel in my heart.  
Somebody new has come along  
I was a fool for waiting too long.  
My life without you won't be the same,  
I should have never played that waiting game.  
I'm so alone now that you're gone,  
I was a fool for waiting too long.  
  
I wasn't smart, I wasn't wise,  
And now I'm by myself with tears in my eyes.  
  
I made my life a life of regret,  
I should have never played hard to get.  
And now I know, I was so wrong,  
I was a fool for waiting too long.  
I was a fool for waiting too long,  
Too long.  

Ecco qui, com'ogni sera  
chi coi gesti fa la gente divertire,  
questo Re dei Pagliacci  
che ride e piange nel suo mondo senza amor.  
Per un Re (per un re) senza regno (senza regno),  
che ha perduto la regina del suo cuore (del suo cuor),  
per guarire il suo dolore,  
lui regala a tutti un po' d'ilarit?.  
Il suo pubblico non vede... quest'uomo triste  
quando ? solo quando piange e si dispera  
e che non pu?... raccontare  
la tristezza del suo cuore senza amore.  
Tra la la la la la li lo,  
Tra la la la la la li lo,  
fingendo canta cos?... hey!  
Tra la la la la la li lo,  
Tra la la la la la li lo,  
il grande Re dei pagliacci.  
Questo Re (questo re) dei pagliacci (dei pagliacci)  
che la gente crede sia di buonumore (buonumor),  
nel suo cuor ha un dolore  
che soltanto chi non l'ama guarir?!  
Il suo pubblico non vede... quest'uomo triste  
quando ? solo quando piange e si dispera,  
e che non pu?... raccontare  
la tristezza del suo cuore senza amore.  
Tra la la la la la li lo,  
Tra la la la la la li lo,  
fingendo canta cos?... hey!  
Tra la la la la la li lo,  
Tra la la la la la li lo,

Strolling along country roads with my baby.  
It starts to rain, it begins to pour.  
Without an umbrella we're soaked to the skin.  
I feel a shiver run up my spine.  
I feel the warmth of her hand in mine.  
  
Oo, I hear laughter in the rain,  
Walking hand in hand with the one I love.  
Oo, how I love the rainy days and the happy way I feel inside.  
  
After a while we run under a tree.  
I turn to her and she kisses me.  
There with the beat of the rain on the leaves  
Softly she breathes and I close my eyes.  
Sharing our love under stormy skies.  
  
Oo, I hear laughter in the rain,  
Walking hand in hand with the one I love.  
Oo, how I love the rainy days and the happy way I feel inside.  
I feel the warmth of her hand in mine.  
  
Oo, I hear laughter in the rain,  
Walking hand in hand with the one I love.  
Oo, how I love the rainy days and the happy way I feel inside.  
Oo, I hear laughter in the rain,  
Walking hand in hand with the one I love.  
Oo, how I love the rainy days and the happy way I feel inside.  
Oo, I hear laughter in the rain,  
Walking hand in hand with the one I love.  
Oo, how I love the rainy days and the happy way I feel inside.  
Oo, I hear laughter in the rain,  
Walking hand in hand with the one I love.  
Oo, how I love the rainy days and the happy way I feelinside

In the shadows  
You get to know your lover mostly by feel  
Got to put your faith in things you can touch  
If you dare to  
'Cause the shadows can make you crazy  
With the things they reveal  
They show it all without revealing too much  
Scare the hell out of you  
'Cause me and my love  
Live among the shadows  
Where the old playground is an alley way  
Now me and my love make love among the shadows  
When the sun goes down in a dark hallway  
Love in the shadows where the crowd never goes  
Deep in the shadows where flowers won't grow  
Me and my baby know love in the shadows  
In the shadows  
You got to work at love to get it to shine  
You can't believe in everything that you see  
Not this time around  
'Cause the shadows can play  
A half a million tricks on your mind  
You try your best but you can never break free  
It just kind of drags you down  
'Cause me and my love  
Live among the shadows  
Where the old playground is an alley way  
Now me and my love make love among the shadows  
When the sun goes down in a dark hallway  
Love in the shadows where the sun never shines  
Deep in the shadows where most men go blind  
Me and my baby find love in the shadows  

Every night I say a little prayer  
I lie in bed beside you and I thank go that you're there  
Remembering how lonely life can be  
Till heaven smiled and sent you down to me  
  
I was born the moment that we met  
It's been years and still the magic hasn't left me yet  
Day by day the thrill goes on and on  
The sparkle in your eyes has never gone  
  
Chorus  
Love keeps getting stronger every day  
And it grows more beautiful in each and every way  
And I swear I love you more  
Than I did the day before  
Love keeps getting stronger every day  
And the things I'm feeling are impossible to say  
Honey you'll just have to take my word  
For all the lovely things you've never heard  
  
Music  
  
Love keeps getting stronger every day  
All I really wanna do is spend my whole life loving you  
Darling please believe me when I say  
Love keeps getting stronger  
Yeah it keeps on getting stronger  
Love keeps getting stronger  
Yeah it keeps on gettting stronger  
Love keeps getting stronger  
Every daaaaaay

Love love will keep us together  
Think of me babe whenever  
Some sweet talking guy comes along singing his song  
Don't mess around,  
You got to be strong  
Just Stop, 'cause I really love You  
Stop, I'll be thinking of you  
Look in my heart and let love keep us together  
  
You, you belong to me now  
Ain't gonna set you free now  
When those guys start hanging around talking me down  
Hear with your heart and you won't hear a sound  
Just stop, 'cause I really love you  
Stop, I'll be thinking of you  
Look in my heart and let love keep us together  
  
Whatever young and beautiful  
Someday your looks will be gone  
When the others turn you off  
Who'll be turning you on  
  
I will, I will, I will, I will  
Be there to share forever  
Love will keep us together  
Said it before and I'll say it again while others pretend  
I'll need you now and I'll need you then  
Stop 'cause I really love Ya  
Stop I'll be thinking of Ya  
Look in my heart and let love keep us together

Questo ? l'ultimo... appuntamento  
Vengo per dirti che t'amo ancora  
Fredda ? la sera, fredda la luna  
Ma la tua mano... non mi abbandona  
Trema... trema... per me  
Non si pu? cancellare... tutta una vita  
In un attimo solo... non si pu? credi a me  
No, no non ? l'ultimo... appuntamento  
Anche domani... ritornerai  
Ritorner?... ritornerai  
Non si pu? cancellare... tutta una vita  
In un attimo solo... non si pu? credi a me  
No, no non ? l'ultimo... appuntamento  
Anche domani... ritornerai  
Ritorner?... ritornerai  
[sfumando]  
Ritorner?... ritornerai

Lunch, lunch will keep us together  
There's no meal that's better  
Just give me a fork and a spoon, it's almost noon  
Make me some food 'cause I wanna eat soon  
  
'Cause stop, 'cause I'm really hungry  
Stop, I can hear my tummy  
Look in the fridge  
And let lunch keep us together  
  
Hot dogs, Mac and cheese  
French fries and ketchup I'll drown  
When the others say they're stuffed  
Who's still chowing it down?  
I will, I will, I will, I will  
  
Bite down and chew forever  
Lunch will keep us together  
Ate it before and I'll eat it again  
Alone or with friends  
Keep the food coming and I'll tell you when  
  
'Cause stop, 'cause I'm really hungry  
Stop, I can hear my tummy  
Look in the fridge  
And let lunch keep us together, whatever  
I will, I will, I will, I will  
  
'Cause stop, 'cause I'm really hungry  
Stop, I can hear my tummy  
Look in the fridge  
And let lunch keep us together, tastes good  
  
Hot dogs, Mac and cheese  
French fries and ketchup I'll drown  
When the others say they're stuffed  
Who's still chowing it down?  
I will, I will, I will, I will  
  
Bite down and chew forever  
Lunch will keep us together  
Ate it before and I'll eat it again  
Alone or with friends  
Keep the food coming and I'll tell you when

Tastes good, yummy, yummy  
I can't stop, I can't stop  
(Lunch a-coming, keep it on)  
Alright, everything

Moon of gold in the sky.  
My loving sweetheart said goodbye.  
Those moonlight kisses that she shared with me,  
Are just a memory.  
  
By the light of your glow.  
Those tender love words whispered low,  
Were just a promise that never came true,  
For she found someone new.  
  
How, how was I to know she'd soon go,  
And leave me longing in the moon glow?  
  
Since she's gone I'm alone,  
I have no sweetheart of my own.  
Just a memory of a love that's grown cold,  
And a tarnished moon of gold.  
  
Since she's gone I'm alone,  
I have no sweetheart of my own.  
Just a memory of a love that's grown cold,  
And a tarnished moon of gold.

My baby, my baby, my baby, my baby  
  
Wait till you see my baby  
You won't believe your eyes  
And if you think there's no such thing as an angel  
You're in for a surprise  
  
Wait till you see my baby, gee whizz she's out of this world  
And out of all the boys that she could have chosen  
She want to be my girl  
  
(What about her hair) Her hair is gold like the sunlight  
(What about her eyes) Her eyes are diamonds that shine  
(What about her lips) Her lips are redder than rubies  
This treasure is mine  
  
She took my heart to heaven  
Now I'm in paradise  
And if you doubt me wait till you see my baby  
You won't believe your eyes  
  
(What about her hair) Her hair is gold like the sunlight  
(What about her eyes) Her eyes are diamonds that shine  
(What about her lips) Her lips are redder than rubies  
This treasure is mine  
  
My baby, my baby, my baby, my baby  
  
Repeat and fade

When I'm unhappy and feelin' lonely,  
And this old world of mine comes tumblin' down,  
You are the someone on who I can depend,  
It's nice to know that I have you, my friend.  
  
When I get crazy, you understand me,  
You overlook the things I don't mean to say.  
You're there beside me whenever things go wrong,  
I'm never lonely knowing you're along.  
  
You and me, the two of us together,  
We go on and face the world whatever happens.  
No matter what gets in our way,  
We see it through from day to day.  
Right up until the very end  
It's gonna be me and my friend.  
  
We share the good times, we share the bad times,  
We meet life head-on with its ups and its downs.  
Some people tell ya that life's a lonely ride,  
But not for us who travel side by side.  
  
You and me, the two of us together,  
We go on and face the world whatever happens.  
No matter what gets in our way,  
We see it through from day to day.  
Right up until the very end  
It's gonna be me and my friend.  
  
I'm never lonely knowing you're along.  
  
It's you and me, the two of us together,  
We go on and face the world whatever happens.  
No matter what gets in our way,  
We see it through from day to day.  
Right up until the very end  
It's gonna be me and my friend,  
It's gonna be me and my friend  

With a cloud above her head  
Here comes rainy Jane.  
If she stops you, man, she'll bore you  
With that sad refrain.  
It's the same old story.  
We've heard a thousand times before.  
She'll tell you how he broke her heart  
And then the tears will start to pour.  
  
Hey, rainy Jane,  
You gotta stop your crying sometime.  
Come on rainy Jane,  
It's up to you to make your own sweet sunshine.  
  
Jane, you're just a shadow of  
The girl you used to be.  
Once you used to live for life  
And now you live for sympathy.  
True, your heart's been broken  
And you got the right to cry,  
But if you're gonna keep it up  
The sunshine's gonna pass you by.  
  
Hey, rainy Jane,  
You gotta stop your crying sometime.  
Come on rainy Jane,  
It's up to you to make your own sweet sunshine.  
  
You can change the weather,  
No one loves a rainy day.  
Come let's get together,  
Clouds will clear up when you cheer up,  
Take each raindrop, make the rain stop.  
  
Hey, rainy Jane,  
You gotta stop your crying sometime.  
Come on rainy Jane,  
It's up to you to make your own sweet sunshine.

Look at the lady she's the one with the broken heart  
Even so she musn't know that I've loved her from the start  
She needs a friend now more than a new romance  
I'd love to take her in my arms but I can't take the chance  
  
Chorus  
Ooh it's such a sad sad story but there'll be a happy ending  
Just you wait and see what I can do, ooooh  
When you see a lady cryin' can you blame a guy for tryin'  
To move on in and make his dreams come true  
  
I gotta secret but I'm keeping it to myself  
I'm bored to tears when my heart hears that she loves someone else  
I tell her I'm sorry but it's really just a lie  
Cos every time he hurts her I'm so happy I could die  
  
Ooh it's such a sad sad story but there'll be a happy ending  
Just you wait and see what I can do, ooooh  
When you see a lady cryin' can you blame a guy for tryin'  
To move on in and make his dreams come true  
  
I love the lady and I want to make her smile  
I know she's lonely but it only hurts for a little while  
Soon as it's over you know the sun is gonna shine  
And when she's ready for someone new, guess who's first in line  
  
Ooh it's such a sad sad story but there'll be a happy ending  
Just you wait and see what I can do, ooooh  
When you see a lady cryin' can you blame a guy for tryin'  
To move on in and make his dreams come true  
  
Ooh it's such a sad sad story but there'll be a happy ending  
Just you wait and see what I can do, ooooh  
When you see a lady cryin' can you blame a guy for tryin'  
To move on in and make his dreams come true

Snowtime, snowtime, oh oh oh oh oh oh.  
Snowtime, snowtime, oh oh oh oh oh oh.  
  
The snow is falling,  
the world's dressed in white tonight,  
and I remember another cold December  
when I held you tight.  
  
And I'm recalling  
the joys that you were there to share,  
the stars burned brightly and I clung to you tightly  
as the snow clung to your hair.  
  
Your love quickly faded out of sight  
like the snow on the ground.  
When spring showed her April smiling face,  
you were no longer around.  
  
I'll be here waiting,  
I'll always be true to you,  
till winter finds you and falling snow reminds you  
that you love me too,  
that you love me too.  
  
Snowtime, snowtime, oh oh oh oh oh oh.  
Snowtime, snowtime, oh oh oh oh oh oh.

Standin' on the outside  
Lookin' in  
You know it's been a long time,  
Don't know where to begin  
So much I want to say,  
so much I want to do,  
Friends are tellin' me  
It's time that you broke through.  
  
I've been through the hard times  
Of searchin' souls,  
You know it's been a hard climb  
From rock and roll.  
Now I feel a need in me,  
so hard to explain,  
Now I've seen the joy and light,  
And I want to remain.  
  
Standin' on the inside,  
I finally broke that line,  
Ring around the circle,  
Don't you know that it feels so fine.  
Every waking moment  
I just want to sing the news  
That I'm standin' on the inside,  
I kicked away them blues.  
  
All the phony faces  
Stand in line.  
All the back-slappers  
Know my name this time.  
Now that I've turned the lock,  
now that I've opened the door,  
I won't be on the outside,  
not anymore, not any more.  
  
Standin' on the inside,  
I finally broke that line,  
Ring around the circle,  
Don't you know that it feels so fine.  
Every waking moment  
I just want to sing the news  
That I'm standin' on the inside,  
I pushed away them blues.  
  
Now that I've turned the lock,  
now that I've opened the door,  
I won't be on the outside, not anymore.  
  
Standin' on the inside,  
I finally broke that line,  
Ring around the circle,  
Don't you know that it feels so fine.  
Every waking moment  
I just wanna sing the news  
That I'm standin' on the inside,  
I kicked away them blues.  
  
Standin' on the inside,  
Standin' on the inside,  
I kicked, kicked, kicked it,  
Standin' on the inside,  
Standin' on the inside,  
I kicked, kicked

You go where you want  
You do what you please  
Never let on, that even once  
That you've ever been lonely  
It's nice to see you alone  
Are you lookin' for somethin'  
Maybe you ain't gettin' at home?  
  
Your hair is in place  
You're dressin' to kill  
Your old man has promised  
When he died he would leave you his money  
And the pool where you swim  
Are you lookin' for somethin'  
Maybe you ain't gettin' from him?  
  
Steppin' out, steppin' out  
To get a little action on the side  
Steppin' out, steppin' out  
The day time queen takes a midnight ride  
  
And it's plain as plain can be  
You're a woman who wants to get free  
If you're steppin' out tonight, honey,  
Come on and step out with me  
  
The party's a bore  
It's bound to get worse  
Let's sneak out somewhere  
And engage in our own celebration  
Will you pour me some wine?  
Are you thinkin', baby, maybe  
Your needs are the same as mine?  
  
Wanna go for a walk,  
Go for a ride,  
Maybe just stand here and think  
What we can do to each other  
No, we don't have to dance  
If you're thinkin' of steppin' out  
Baby, this is your chance  
  
Steppin' out, steppin' out  
To get a little action on the side  
Steppin' out, steppin' out  
The day time queen takes a midnight ride  
  
And it's plain as plain can be  
You're a woman who wants to get free  
If you're steppin' out tonight, honey,  
Come on and step out with me  

A thousand stars fill the summer sky,  
tonight, my love, the beach belongs to you and I.  
And here we are lying in the sand,  
I hear the sound of music when you touch my hand.  
  
Just like the waves crashing on the shore,  
the echo of our love will last forevermore.  
Tonight, my love, hold me tight, my love,  
as our hearts compose a summer symphony.  
  
The symphony of a summer night.  
The echo of our love will last forevermore.  
  
But when morning comes and you go away,  
I'll close my eyes and I'll still hear the music play.  
The symphony of a summer night  
will last until the end of time.  
The symphony of a summer night.

When I was young, no worries in my head,  
I used to flap my arms, and fly around the bed,  
Just like a super bird, zoom, zoom, zoom.  
Up and down the chandelier, all around the room.  
  
When I told the people that I could really fly,  
They said that little boys ain't supposed to lie.  
Poor little super bird sitting on the ground,  
No zoom, zoom, zoom, when anyone's around.  
  
Fly, fly, fly super bird, super bird.  
While you're young super bird, super bird.  
There's time enough to wreck your dreams.  
Have your fun, super bird.  
  
They said I couldn't, so what did I do then?  
I cried myself to sleep and never tried again.  
Poor little super bird they woke you up too soon.  
No Santa Claus or green cheese on the moon.  
  
It skipped my mind for years, at least until tonight,  
When I tucked the kids in bed and I turned out the light.  
There at the doorway, you'll never guess what I heard  
"Zoom, zoom, zoom, super bird."  
  
Fly, fly, fly super bird, super bird.  
While you're young super bird, super bird.  
There's time enough to wreck your dreams,  
Have your fun, super bird.

That's when the music takes me  
Takes to a brighter day  
That's when the music takes me  
Helpin' me to find my way  
  
When the day is so long that I can't hold on  
When I'm down and I think my hope is gone  
Oooh, Yeah,  
That's when the music takes me  
Closer to a brighter daaaay  
I can feel my soul explodin'  
There's a good feelin'  
Helpin' me to find my waaay  
My, my, my way  
  
When the bluebird sings her sad, sad song  
And the wind brings a cold to tag along  
Oh, yeah,  
I can feel the spirit move me  
I can almost touch the sky  
Reachin' for a new tomorrow  
I know it's hard  
But music makes me waaaaanna try  
Wanna try  
And then  
That's when the music takes me  
Takes to a brighter day  
Yeah, yeah  
That's when the music takes me  
Helpin' me to find my way  
(That's when the music takes me)  
(That's when the music takes me)  
Oh, yeah  
But when the music takes me  
Closer to a brighter day  
I can feel my soul explodin'  
There's a good feelin'  
Helpin' me to fiiiiiiind my waaay  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
And then I'm sayin'  
That's when the music takes me  
Takes to a brighter day  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
That's when the music takes me  
Helpin' me to find my way  
(Clap)  
Happy, happy, happy day  
Happy, happy, happy day  
Happy, happy, happy day  
(That's when the music takes me)  
(That's when the music takes me)  
(That's when the music takes me)  
(And that's when the music takes me)  
Happy, happy when the music takes  
Whooooooo  

The way you hold me tight, the way you kiss good-night,  
And every time we dance, my heart goes in a trance.  
You're something special, oh so special,  
You're the girl for me.  
The way you fix your hair, the way you choose your clothes,  
And every time you smile, your lovely dimple shows.  
You're something special, oh so special,  
You're the girl for me.  
Anything you ask me, I will do,  
Anything at all I'll do for you.  
The way you like to laugh at things we used to do,  
And even when I'm sad, you make me happy too.  
You're something special, oh so special,  
You're the girl for me.

Girl we made it to the top  
we went so high we couldn't stop  
we climbed the ladder leading us nowhere  
Two of us together building castles in the air  
We spun so fast we couldn't tell  
the gold ring from the carousel  
How could we know the right would turn-out bad  
Everything we wanted, was everything we had  
I miss the Hungry Years  
the once upon a time  
the lovely long ago  
we didn't a dime  
those days of me and you,  
we lost along the way  
how could I be so blind  
not to see the door  
closing on the World  
I now hunger for  
Looking through my tears,  
I miss the Hungry years  
We shared our day dreams one by one  
Making plans was so much fun  
We set our goals and reached the highest star  
Things that we were after were much better from afar  
Here we stand just me and you  
with everything and nothing too  
It wasn't worth the price we had to pay  
Honey take me home Let's go back to yesterday  
I miss the Hungry Years  
the once upon a time the lovely long ago  
we didn't have a dime  
those days of me and you,  
we lost along the way  
how could I be so blind  
not to see the door  
closing on the World I now hunger for  
Looking through my tears,  
I miss the Hungry years  
I miss the Hungry Years ?  

  
All my life  
I've been a kind of lonely man  
Searching high and low  
Looking for my way  
Then all at once  
I saw you right in front of me  
I knew right then and there  
My lonely days were through  
You're just a rose  
That shimmers in the sun  
And now I know  
My life has just begun  
You are the sweetest thing  
That could ever, ever be  
And you're a miracle to me  
You fill my life  
With tenderness and harmony  
I never thought  
That I'd be laughing once again  
You fill the room  
With something warm and wonderful  
I can't imagine life  
Without your precious love  
You're just a rose  
That shimmers in the sun  
And now I know  
My life has just begun  
You are the sweetest thing  
That could ever, ever be  
And you're a miracle to me  
Rivers bend rivers flow  
Till the end of time  
They keep flowing  
Through eternity  
Take me there  
Sail away  
Take me to the sea  
You're a river that flows inside of me  
You're just a rose  
That shimmers in the sun  
And now I know  
My life has just begun  
You are the sweetest thing  
That I could ever, ever see  
And you're a miracle to me  
!  
  

You think you know me pretty well,  
But how can you tell,  
You never get inside my head.  
The times we talk, we never speak,  
We play hide and seek  
So many things are left unsaid.  
  
Why can't you see  
What's on the other side of me,  
The side of me that reaches out to you.  
Sweet thoughts and dreams,  
Like drops of rain on rippling streams  
That wind and bend,  
Rivers with no end,  
Flowing on the other side of me.  
  
It seems I always get unstrung  
I trip on my tongue  
With words that come out something else.  
I'm so afraid the things I say  
Might chase you away,  
I have to hide behind myself.  
  
Why can't you see  
What's on the other side of me,  
The side of me that reaches out to you.  
Why must I hide  
These feelings that have been denied.  
Only you can set me free  
See what's on the other side of me.  
  
La la la la la la la la  
La la la la la  
La la la la la la la la  
La la la la la la la la  
La la la la la  
I have to hide behind myself.  
  
Why can't you see  
What's on the other side of me,  
The side of me that reaches out to you.  
Why must I hide  
These feelings that have been denied.  
Only you can set me free  
See what's on the other side of me,  
On the other side of me,  
On the other side of me.  

Anyone who's played on a record date  
will remember stage door Jenny,  
Well I saw her last night  
and man she looked like she wasn't gettin' any  
Oh - Rock 'n' roll kind of took its toll  
when she shed her inhibitions,  
Too many scenes in limousines  
and dressing room intermissions.  
  
She was the queen of nineteen sixty four  
But the truth of the matter is  
nobody wants her any more.  
There was a time she could have shown them how,  
But nobody wants an over-age groupie now.  
  
When it came to a superstar,  
Jenny was a bragger,  
She spread it around to everyone in town  
that she made it with Mick Jagger  
Oh - but there's no doubt, when the truth comes out,  
true love will always conquer,  
She didn't get Mick, but she got a kick  
and a black eye from Bianca.  
  
She was the queen of nineteen sixty four,  
What a pity she became a shadow of the girl she was before.  
She passed her prime, it seems a shame somehow,  
But nobody wants an over-age groupie now.  
  
Dwee da da da dwee da da da dwee da da da da,  
Dwee da da da da da da , dwee da da da da.  
Dwee da da da da da da da da, da da da da da,  
Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do.  
  
I'm afraid that this morning's trade  
had a sad obituary,  
There'll be no more Jenny at the door,  
They took her to the cemetery  
Just an autograph book and a stereo,  
there was no one she was close to,  
She was found with her arms around an Elvis Presley poster.  
  
She was the queen of nineteen sixty four,  
Tonight there'll be a moment of silence at the Troubador.  
There was a time she could have shown 'em how,  
But nobody wants an over-age groupie now,  
But nobody wants an over-age groupie now.  
  
Dwee da da da dwee da da da dwee da da da da,  
De de de de da da da da da da da da da da da da.  
Papa oom a mow mow, oom mow mow mow,  
Papa oom a mow mow, oom mow mow mow,  
Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do  

I haven't changed, I'm still the same old me,  
Yes I'm still the same old fool I used to be.  
  
I thought this heart of mine would never miss you,  
I thought this heart of mine would never cry.  
I told myself I'd get along without you,  
But I realise I told myself a lie.  
  
I'm still the same old fool I used to be,  
I think of you and suddenly I'm helpless.  
I haven't changed, I'm still the same old me,  
Yes I'm still the same old fool I used to be.  
  
Although you've got the kind of love that hurts me,  
Oh what I'd give if we could start again.  
If I could hold you close for just a moment,  
I'd gladly let you break my heart again.  
  
I'm still the same old fool I used to be,  
I think of you and suddenly I'm helpless.  
I haven't changed, I'm still the same old me,  
  
Yes I'm still the same old fool I used to be,  
Yes I'm still the same old fool I used to be.

Grass is green  
Like I've never seen.  
Sky above was never so blue.  
Now here am I  
No one standing near.  
It's a lonely world  
Such a lonely world.  
  
The world through a tear  
From days gone by  
The world through a tear  
Too slow to dry  
The world through a tear.  
The tear I cry.  
  
Just last year  
We wandered here  
And dreamed a dream  
That never would die.  
Now only me  
Hopin' she'll appear  
It's a lonely world  
Such a lonely world  
  
The world through a tear  
From days gone by  
The world through a tear  
Too slow to dry  
The world through a tear  
The tear I cry.

Too ru ru down, doo be doo down down  
Coma coma down, doo be doo down down  
Coma coma down, doo be doo down down  
Breaking up is hard to do  
Tu non lo sai  
Che senza te  
Anche il sole non riscalda pi?,  
Non esiste nulla pi?...  
? Tutto vuoto intorno a me...  
Tu non lo sai  
Che senza te  
? Difficile per me pensar  
Alle cose d'ogni d?...  
? Tutto vuoto intorno a me...  
Difficile? Lasciarsi  
Tu lo sai!  
Non restiamo in miseria cos?  
Soltanto abbracciati al dolor,  
Ricominciamo tutto come fosse nuovo quest'amor!  
Tu non lo sai  
Che senza te  
Ogni cosa non esiste pi?,  
Anche il sole non scalda pi?...  
? Tutto vuoto intorno a me...  
(Difficile? Lasciarsi  
Tu lo sai!)  
Non restiamo in miseria cos?  
(soltanto abbracciati al dolor,)  
Ricominciamo tutto come fosse nuovo quest'amor!  
Tu non lo sai  
Che senza te  
Ogni cosa non esiste pi?,  
Anche il sole non scalda pi?...  
? Tutto vuoto intorno a me...  
Too ru ru down, doo be doo down down  
Coma coma down, doo be doo down down  
[sfumando]  
Coma coma down, doo be doo down down  
Coma coma down, doo be doo down down...

You slept your night now it's morning time  
That's the time to rise and shine  
Don't you cry and don't be blue  
Wakin' up is hard to do  
Just brush your teeth and then get dressed  
When you comb your hair you'll look the best  
Now you know it's really true  
Wakin' up is hard to do  
They say that wakin' up is hard to do  
Wear a smile don't you be blue  
Just wipe the sleep from your eyes  
Instead of going back to bed  
You got to stretch and face the day  
Just listen to the birdies sing  
And the flowers that await the spring  
Rise and shine, you're dreaming's through  
Wakin' up is hard to do  
They say that wakin' up is hard to do  
Wear a smile don't you be blue  
Just wipe the sleep from your eyes  
Instead of going back to bed  
You got to stretch and face the day  
Just listen to the birdies sing  
And the flowers that await the spring  
Rise and shine, you're dreaming's through  
Wakin' up is hard to do  

We kiss in a shadow, we hide from the moon,  
Our meetings are few and over too soon!  
We speak in a whisper afraid to be heard  
When people are near, we speak not a word!  
  
Alone in our secret together we sigh  
For one smiling day to be free!  
  
To kiss in the sunlight and say to the sky  
Behold and believe what you see,  
Behold how my lover loves me!  
  
Alone in our secret together we sigh  
For one smiling day to be free!  
  
To kiss in the sunlight and say to the sky  
Behold and believe what you see.  
Behold how my lover loves me!

What am I gonna do when the sun goes down  
And all the lights are low,  
What am I gonna do when I recall  
The love we used to know.  
I remember the happiness we knew,  
Darling can't we make up soon  
'Cause I don't know what I'm gonna do.  
  
What am I gonna do on Wednesday night  
When I used to call you on the phone,  
What am I gonna say at the Record Hop  
When I show up alone.  
There all ask me what's become of you,  
Darling can't we make up soon  
'Cause I don't know what I'm gonna do.  
  
At the movies or at the football game,  
Please believe me, nothing's gonna be the same.  
  
So what am I gonna do on Saturday night  
Whan everything goes wrong,  
How am I gonna feel when the radio  
Plays our favourite song.  
I'm so lonely just like Mr. Blue,  
Darling can't we make up soon  
'Cause I don't know what I'm gonna do.

Where the boys are, someone waits for me  
A smilin' face, a warm embrace,  
Two arms to hold me tenderly  
Where the boys are, my true love will be  
He's walkin' down some street in town  
And I know he's lookin' there for me  
  
In the crowd of a million people  
I'll find my valentine  
And then I'll climb to the highest steeple  
And tell the world he's mine  
  
Till he holds me I wait impatiently  
Where the boys are, where the boys are  
Where the boys are, someone waits for me  
  
Till he holds me I wait impatiently  
Where the boys are, where the boys are  
Where the boys are, someone waits for me

Where the toys are  
That's where dad will be  
Without a clue or what to do  
He still insists on building stuff for me  
Where the toys are  
Who knows what I'll see  
A wobbly bite, a flightless kite  
To games that still need batteries  
In a box with a million pieces  
Are instructions he won't read  
And he never lets me help him  
No matter how I plead  
Till I'm older I'll wait so nervously  
Where the toys are  
Where the toys are  
Where the toys are  
That's where dad will be  
In a box with a million pieces  
Are instructions he won't read  
And he never lets me help him  
No matter how I plead  
Till I'm older I'll wait so nervously  
Where the toys are  
Where the toys are  
Where the toys are  
That's where dad will be  
That's where dad will be  
That's where dad will be  
Oh no, that's where dad will be  
I know he's trying  
That's where dad will be  
Doesn't look good  
That's where dad will be  
Oh no, oh no, oh no  

Like the summer wind that whispers in the dark  
Let the song ignite the spark and you can hear the love  
Hush of evening and the rustling of the leaves  
The murmur as a baby breathes and you can hear the love  
  
Chorus  
Her body moves just like a symphony she needs you  
To be the one who's harmony will guide her  
And let her know she's getting through  
And you can hear the love  
Sometimes it sounds just like a never ending choir  
She puts your words to music's sweet desire  
And whenever she is near, you can hear the love  
(Don't you know that you can feel it, touch it, always hear the love)  
  
Tender touches to the rythm of the night  
Written down in candle light beneath the stars above  
Sweetly woven in a perfect applique  
Listen to the music play and you can hear the love  
  
Ch x 2  
  
Ad lib and fade

Whenever the day is bringing you down  
And nothing's going your way  
Just turn it around  
Don't let the world upset you  
Get depressed and what doesn't get you  
You've got a chance to make it  
Reach right out and take it  
Leave your worries behind  
You gotta make your own sunshine  
You gotta make your own sunshine  
  
If nothing in life is turning you on  
And everyone of your friends  
All seem to be gone  
Just start yourself a hummin'  
Remember that the good times are coming  
Life is a celebration  
Don't waste your invitation  
Hang those tears on the line  
You gotta make your own sunshine  
You gotta make your own sunshine  
  
When you're feeling down  
You gotta aim high  
Don't stare at the ground  
Reach for the sky... Reach for the sky!  
  
Just keep yourself up  
Don't ever complain  
Before you walk in the sun  
You gotta laugh in the rain  
  
Just get your act together  
Be readdy for who and whatever  
Life is a smile so find it  
Put your face behind it  
Get it straigh in your mind  
You gotta make your own sunshine  
You gotta make your own sunshine  
  
Just get your act together  
Be readdy for who and whatever  
Life is a smile so find it  
Put your face behind it  
Get it straigh in your mind  
You gotta make your own sunshine  
You gotta make your own sunshine  
You gotta make your own sunshine  
You gotta make your own sunshine  
You gotta make your own sunshine

You hear his voice above the roaring of the crowd  
Dance while he goes through his charade  
You see him standing there so tall and proud  
And you know damn well the man has got it made  
  
[Chorus]  
Applause, applause for your favorite entertainer  
Write a love letter to your favorite entertainer  
Applause, applause, because he's up there singing just for you  
Singing just for you  
  
His every movement draws you closer to the stage  
Helplessly carried on the tide  
Giddy and feeling almost half your age  
It's magic he's got going on inside  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You'd love to touch him, but you know you wouldn't dare  
To kiss the lips that sing the song  
You wave and scream to let him know you're there  
With luck he'll sign the book you've brought along  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Singing just for you
