They say that home is where the heart is  
I guess I haven't found my home  
And we keep driving round in circles  
Afraid to call this place our own  
  
And are we there yet?  
  
They say there's linings made of silver  
Folded inside each raining cloud  
Well, we need someone to deliver  
Our silver lining now  
  
And are we there yet?  
And are we there yet?  
And are we there yet?  
Home, home, home  
Home, home, home  
  
They say you're really not somebody  
Until somebody else loves you  
Well, I am waiting to make somebody  
Somebody soon  
  
And are we there yet?  
And are we there yet?  
And are we there yet?  
Home, home, home  
Home, home, home  
  
Where you will lie on the rug  
While I play with the dog  
And it won't be too much  
'Cause this is too much  
'Cause this is too much for me to hold  
This is too much for me to hold  
  
Home, home, home  
And are we there yet?  
And are we there yet?  
And are we there yet?  
  
Home, home, home  
Home, home, home, home  
  
And are we there yet?  
And are we there yet?  
And are we there yet?  
And are we there?

I call you my friend  
And that's all that I knew  
Why do I have to pretend  
To find ways to be around you?  
You've been there all along  
Holding my hand like you do  
Why do I feel that it's wrong  
To love to be around you?  
And I think I'm losing my mind  
Maybe I have been hopelessly blind to your beauty  
And you have a sweet sinful smile, I'm in trouble  
'Cause you turn me upside down and around and around  
Do you feel what I feel? Well?  
Do you feel this way too?  
That every wound seems to heal when I am around you  
And I must be losing my mind  
Maybe I have been hopelessly blind to your beauty  
And you have a sweet sinful smile, I'm in trouble  
'Cause you turn me upside down and around and around and around  
And I must be losing my mind  
Maybe you have a sweet sinful smile, I'm in trouble  
Cause you turn me upside down and around and around  
Turn me upside down and around and around  
Turn me upside down and around and around  
My feet don't touch the ground  
When I'm around you  
When I'm around you, you, you, you, you  

I just want to be okay, be okay, be okay  
I just want to be okay today  
I just want to be okay, be okay, be okay  
I just want to be okay today  
  
I just want to feel today, feel today, feel today  
I just want to feel something today  
I just want to feel today, feel today, feel today  
I just want to feel something today  
  
[Chorus]  
Open me up and you will see  
I'm a gallery of broken hearts  
I'm beyond repair, let me be  
And give me back my broken parts  
  
I just want to know today, know today, know today  
I just want to know something today  
I just want to know today, know today, know today  
Know that maybe I will be okay  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Just give me back my pieces  
Just give them back to me please  
Just give me back my pieces  
And let me hold my broken parts  
  
I just want to be okay, be okay, be okay  
I just want to be okay today  
I just want to be okay, be okay, be okay  
I just want to be okay today  
  
I just want to feel today, feel today, feel today  
I just want to feel something today  
I just want to know today, know today, know today  
Know that maybe I will be okay  
Know that maybe I will be okay  
Know that maybe I will be okay

If you knew me would you save that seat for me  
If you knew me would you finally let me free  
We're all blood, we're all blood, blood brothers  
We're all blood, we're all blood, blood brothers  
  
If you loved me would you hold onto my hand  
If you loved me would you finally understand  
That we're all blood, we're all blood, blood brothers  
We're all blood, we're all blood, blood brothers  
  
What you need, what you need I need too  
What you are, what you are I am too  
'cause we're all the same under a different name  
We're all blood, we're all blood, blood brothers  
We're all blood, we're all blood, blood brothers  
  
If you knew me would you lift me from the ground  
If you loved me would you even hear me make a sound  
We're all blood, we're all blood, blood brothers  
We're all blood, we're all blood, blood brothers  
  
What you need, what you need I need too  
What you are, what you are I am too  
'cause we're all the same under a different name  
We're all blood, we're all blood, blood brothers  
We're all blood, we're all blood, blood brothers  
  
We're all blood, we're all blood, blood brothers

Have you ever thought about what protects our hearts?  
Just a cage of rib bones and other various parts.  
So it's fairly simple to cut right through the mess.  
And to stop the muscle that makes us confess.  
  
We are so fragile,  
And our cracking bones make noise,  
And we are just,  
Breakable, breakable, breakable, girls and boys.  
  
You fasten my seatbelt because it is the law.  
In your two ton death trap I finally saw.  
A piece of love in your face that bathed me in regret.  
Then you drove me to places I'll never forget.  
  
And we are so fragile,  
And our cracking bones make noise,  
And we are just,  
Breakable, breakable, breakable girls and boys.  
  
And we are so fragile,  
And our our cracking bones make noise,  
And we are just,  
Breakable, breakable, breakable girls-  
Breakable, breakable, breakable girls-  
Breakable, breakable, breakable girls and boys.

There's a corner of your heart for me  
There's a corner of your heart just for me  
I will pack my bags just to stay in the corner of your heart  
Just to stay in the corner of your heart  
  
There is room beneath your bed for me  
There is room beneath your bed just for me  
I will leave this town just to sleep underneath your bed  
Just to sleep underneath your bed  
  
There's one minute of your day  
There's one minute of your day  
I will leave this man just to occupy one minute of your day  
Just to occupy one minute of your day  
  
Just to sleep underneath your bed  
  
Just to stay in the corner of you heart

The colored lights, they brightly shine  
Unlike your eyes avoiding mine  
The snow is folding sheet upon sheet  
Our hands not holding as we cross the street  
  
[Chorus]  
You have had your fill your fill of me  
You have had your fill your fill of me  
  
I wore the dress I thought you loved.  
But my boots are filling with snow you shoved  
Off of the car we climb into  
You finished first, I must catch up to you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
How can I catch up when I don't don't want to?  
How can I catch up when I still want you?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
December baby, you are my,  
December baby, you are my,  
December baby, you are my,  
December baby, you are mine

I woke up this morning with a funny taste in my head.  
Spackled some butter over my whole grain bread.  
Something tastes different, maybe it's my tongue.  
Something tastes different, suddenly I'm not so young.  
  
I'm just a stranger, even to myself.  
A re-arranger of the proverbial bookshelf.  
Don't be a fool girl, tell him you love him.  
Don't be a fool girl, you're not above him.  
  
I never thought I could love anyone but myself.  
Now I know I can't love anyone but you.  
You make me think that maybe I won't die alone.  
Maybe I won't die alone.  
  
Kiss the boys as they walk by, call me their baby.  
But little do they know, I'm just a maybe.  
Maybe my baby will be the one to leave sore.  
Maybe my baby will settle the score.  
  
I never thought I could love anyone but myself.  
Now I know I can't love anyone buy you.  
But you make me think that maybe I won't die alone.  
Maybe I won't die alone.  
  
What have I become?  
Something soft and really quite dumb.  
Because I've fallen, oh, 'cause I've fall- fallen, oh 'cause I've fall-fall-
fallen  
So far away from the place where I started from.  
  
I never thought I could love anyone.  
I never thought I could love anyone.  
I never thought I could love anyone.  
But you  
But you  
But you  
But you  
But you but you make me think that maybe I won't  
Die alone.  
Maybe I won't die alone.

Look at yourself  
Are you sad? Are you sad?  
Don't be afraid  
It's not bad to be sad  
Dust off your hands  
And reach into foreign lands of your mind  
Don't be kind, cause we're all fools  
Each others tools  
When the cracks on my bedroom ceiling  
Give me this empty bottle feeling  
I think it's time to repaint  
It's time to repaint myself  
Try not to peer through plastic eyes  
Through plastic eyes  
Peel back the rind  
And you'll find something kind  
You're still you, remember you  
Rosy child, strong and wild with apple lungs  
You, you breathe with ease  
Floating on the breeze, floating on the breeze  
When the cracks on my bedroom ceiling  
Give me this empty bottle feeling  
I think it's time to repaint  
It's time to repaint my  
When the cracks on my bedroom ceiling  
Give me this empty bottle feeling  
I think it's time to repaint  
It's time to repaint myself  
Maybe blue or green  
Or something in between  
Maybe blue, maybe green  
Maybe something in between  
Maybe blue or green  
May something  
In between, in between  

Sometimes in the morning  
When I wake up I see your face  
But you are in a new life  
In a new love, in a new place  
Oh, the heart holds many hands  
My dear, it's time I let yours go  
  
Everybody, everybody wants to love  
Everybody, everybody wants to be loved  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
Everybody, everybody wants to love  
Everybody, everybody wants to be loved  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
I'm fine now, it just took time now  
You can see how much I've grow  
Made room love, for a new love  
Now my feet won't walk alone  
Oh, the heart holds many hands  
My love it's time I let yours go  
  
Everybody, everybody wants to love  
Everybody, everybody wants to be loved  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
Everybody, everybody wants to love  
Everybody, everybody wants to be loved  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
I am ready to love, I am ready for love  
I am ready to love, I am ready for love  
  
Everybody, everybody wants to love  
Everybody, everybody wants to be loved  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
Everybody, everybody wants to love  
Everybody, everybody wants to be loved  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
Everybody wants to love  
Everybody needs to love  
Everybody wants to love  
Everybody needs to love  
  
Everybody wants to love  
Everybody needs to love  
Everybody wants to love  
Everybody needs to love  
  
Everybody, everybody wants to love

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
Everybody, everybody wants to love  
Everybody, everybody wants to be loved  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I feel it in my skin, I feel it through my bones  
Your fingertips are falling far from where I know  
I try to pin you down but you move like a dream  
I want to find you but you dropped me in the sea  
  
In the sea in the sea in the sea in the sea  
You dropped me  
In the sea in the sea in the sea in the sea  
  
No no don't rescue me  
I like the salt water sting  
It feels so good to feel  
It feels so good just to feel something  
In the sea in the sea in the sea in the sea  
  
You move so softly in the middle of the night  
Like a cocoon in sheets you wrap you up so tight  
Remember how we used to tangle up and breathe  
Now you're so far away you roll me in the sea  
  
In the sea in the sea in the sea in the sea  
You dropped me  
In the sea in the sea in the sea in the sea  
  
No no don't rescue me  
I like the salt water sting  
It feels so good to feel  
It feels so good just to feel something  
In the sea in the sea in the sea in the sea  
  
Oh oh oh  
  
No no don't rescue me  
I like the salt water sting  
It feels so good to feel  
It feels so good just to feel something  
In the sea in the sea in the sea in the sea

I never thought I'd fall so far down  
This incredibly long dark hole  
Something so sweet as the sound of your feet  
On the floor would give me more room to breath  
  
I'll say goodbye again tonight  
The third time's the charmer they say  
Your words are inked on my skin  
The marks of incredible love  
  
Incredible love, you fill me  
Incredible love, you spill me  
Incredible love, you kill me  
Incredible love  
  
Everything says it's time to go  
But the smell of your skin makes me stay  
You are not mine to ask things of  
But I ask you anyway, but I ask you anyway  
  
Incredible love, you fill me  
Incredible love, you spill me  
Incredible love, you kill me  
Incredible love, incredible love  
  
You take it away but then you give it right back  
Just take it away don't give it back  
  
Incredible love, incredible love, incredible love  
Incredible love, incredible love, incredible love  
  
Incredible love, you fill me  
Incredible love, you spill me  
Incredible love, you kill me  
Incredible love, incredible love, incredible love  
Incredible love

The storm is coming but I don't mind.  
People are dying, I close my blinds.  
All that I know is I'm breathing now.  
  
I want to change the world, instead I sleep.  
I want to believe in more than you and me.  
But all that I know is I'm breathing.  
All I can do is keep breathing.  
All we can do is keep breathing  
Now I, now I  
Now I, now, now  
  
All that I know is I'm breathing.  
All I can do is keep breathing [Repeat: x5]  
  
All we can do is keep breathing [Repeat: x5]  
Now

Eyes on the prize and I can't capsize this time  
'Cause there's somebody else in my boat  
Used to live alone in a tomb I made my own  
But now I've gone and given up my coat  
  
And it's cold outside but I'm just fine  
You are mine to keep warm  
  
Down down down I go  
On a road that I don't know  
And I ain't got a thing in my bag  
Some things you can not plan  
Like your hand in mine  
Just put your hand in mine  
  
And it's cold outside but I'm just fine  
You are mine to keep warm  
Yeah it's cold outside but I'm just fine  
You are mine to keep warm  
  
Sables and wine till the end of time you give me much more than that  
Diamond rings and beautiful things  
Oh you give me much more than that  
When you smile  
  
You are mine to keep warm  
And it's cold outside but I'm just fine  
You are mine to keep warm

I am a lady in Spain  
I'll sing a haunting refrain  
I am a lady from Mars  
And I can unscrew the stars  
I can be anything that I see  
I can be anything that I, anything that I see  
  
I am in love with a boy  
Manufactured to destroy  
So I shall unravel my love  
Like an old red woolen glove  
  
I can do anything I want to  
I can do anything I want, anything my heart tells me to do  
Tells me to do  
Tells me to do  
  
I can be anything that I see  
I can do anything I want to  
  
I can do anything I want to  
I can be anything that I, anything that I see

Hey, I'll move out of the way for you  
Hey, I'll move out of the way for her too  
I never thought we'd end up here in separate cages  
It doesn't go like this, you've left out some pages  
  
Hey, when was the last time you laughed  
And did you mean it when you did?  
I'm just wondering, the sound in your voice it's abounding  
It's astounding how you live so close to your cure  
  
I never know what to do with my love  
I never know what to do with my hands  
So I'll put them behind my back  
I'll put them behind my back  
Behind my back  
  
Hey, don't you know what I mean when I say  
Hey, see it in my face, I'm breaking  
I've waited for so long just to know  
That you'd wrap yourself around me if you couldn't let go  
  
I never know what to do with my love  
I never know what to do with my hands  
So I'll put them behind my back  
(Put them behind my back)  
I'll put them behind my back  
(Behind my back)  
Behind my back  
(Put them behind my back)  
  
Can I move out of the way tomorrow?  
Can I move into the way tonight?

You're in the mood for love  
You're in the mood to dance  
You're in the mood for a little romance  
You're in the mood for love  
I see you've pressed those pants  
I see you've styled that hair  
There doesn't seems to be much of it there  
You're in the mood to dance  
Can I have this chance  
To be your little romance?  
Can I have the stance?  
I am in the mood for love  
I am all dressed up tonight  
I've waited all night long  
When will they finally play your song?  
I am in the mood to dance  
Can I have this chance  
To be your little romance?  
Can I have the stance?  
I am in the mood for love  
I am in the mood for love  
If it?s the only chance I get  
If it?s the only chance then get  
Ready to throw your shoes away  
For I will sweep, sweep, sweep  
you're off your feet  
I will sweep, sweep, sweep  
You're off your feet  
To be your little romance  
Can I have this chance  
To be your little romance?  
Can I have the stance?  
I am in the mood for  
You are in the mood for me  
We're in the mood for love  

I have taken a wrong turn?  
When will I learn? When will I learn?  
Shall I show them all my scars?  
Cherry red bleeding burn  
  
Like an angry apple tree  
I throw my apples if you get to close to me  
But if I look to my right  
Will I see the one I fight for?  
If I look to my right or if I turn to my left  
Will I see that I've kept my heart locked up?  
Locked up so tight  
  
Love, love, love, love is everywhere  
But not a drop for me to drink  
Tie me up and bind my feet  
Drop me in and watch me sink  
  
Like an angry apple tree  
I throw my apples if you get to close to me  
But if I look to my right  
Will I see the one I fight for?  
If I look to my right or if I turn to my left  
Will I see that I've kept my heart locked up?  
Locked up  
  
If I was 17 I could find it in between  
The cushions of somebody's couch  
I could find it, I could find it  
If I was 17 I could find it in a dream  
A dime a dozen kind of love  
I could find it I could find it  
  
But I'm not 17  
And I lost it in between the birthday cakes  
And past mistakes that roll on by  
  
But if I look to my right  
Will I see the one I fight for?  
If I look to my right or If I turn to my left  
Will I see that I've kept my heart locked up?  
Locked up so tight

I don't wanna be the one to say goodbye  
But I will, I will, I will  
I don't wanna sit on the pavement while you fly  
But I will, I will, oh yes I will  
  
'Cause maybe in the future, you're gonna come back  
You're gonna come back around  
Maybe in the future you're gonna come back  
You're gonna come back  
  
Oh, the only way to really know is to really let it go  
Maybe you're gonna come back, you're gonna come back  
You're gonna come back to me  
  
I don't wanna be the first to let it go  
But I know, I know, I know  
If you have the last hands that I want to hold  
Then I know I've got to let them go  
  
'Cause maybe in the future you're gonna come back  
You're gonna come back around  
Maybe in the future you're gonna come back  
You're gonna come back  
  
Oh, the only way to really know is to really let it go  
Maybe you're gonna come back, you're gonna come back  
You're gonna come back  
  
I still feel you on the right side of the bed  
And I still feel you in the blankets pulled over my head  
But I'm gonna wash away,(I'm gonna wash away) oh I'm gonna wash away  
Everything till you come home to me  
  
Maybe in the future you're gonna come back  
You're gonna come back  
In the future you're gonna come back  
You're gonna come back  
  
Maybe in the future you're gonna come back  
You're gonna come back around  
Maybe in the future you're gonna come back  
You're gonna come back  
  
Oh, the only way to really know is to really let it go  
Maybe in the future you're gonna come back  
You're gonna come back around  
Maybe in the future you're gonna come back  
You're gonna come back  
  
Oh, the only way to really know is to really let it go  
Maybe you're gonna come back, you're gonna come back  
You're gonna come back to me,  
You're gonna come back to me  
You're gonna come back to me

Once I made a man all out of snow  
He had the darkest eyes and a button nose  
I told him all my sadness and my fear  
And he just listened with a snowy ear  
  
But when I came around the next day  
My friend had gone and melted all away  
I saw his eyes lying on the ground  
I made a sound that was something like crying  
  
Oh, one day you will go away from this  
Oh, one day you will know we're men of snow  
We melt one day  
  
And winters come and my love, the winters go  
And time stacks up in piles like winter snow  
And everything you love and hold so dear  
Won't really matter when we disappear  
  
Oh, one day you will go away from this  
Oh, one day you will know we're men of snow  
We melt one day  
  
Oh, one day you will go away from this  
Oh, one day you will know we're men of snow  
We melt, you know, we're men of snow  
We melt one day

Yesterday I woke up  
With your head on my arm  
My hand was numb, circulation gone  
But I dared not move the pretty sleeping one  
  
The sun had painted patterns on your face  
As you breathe Sunday air  
You rolled onto my open arms  
I became your pillow  
You let me smooth your hair  
  
I will sing you morning lullabies  
You are beautiful and peaceful this way  
I know you have to close your eyes on everyone  
Let me help you, I'll sing you to sleep  
With morning lullabies  
  
Let me lie in the curve of your body tonight  
And I will hear you tumble into sleep  
I will watch you heal  
I will watch you heal with me  
  
I will sing you morning lullabies  
You are beautiful and peaceful this way  
I know you have to close your eyes on everyone  
Let me help you, I'll sing you to sleep  
With morning lullabies  
  
I know you have to close your eyes on everyone  
Let me help you, I'll sing you to sleep  
With morning lullaby, bye baby  
Close your eyes and I will sing you  
Morning lullabies and I will sing you  
Morning lullabies

Mosquito, mosquito, buzzing around  
Landing on my knee  
How can I truly be angry with you?  
All you want is to be part of me  
Now we are lying and counting the leaves  
Underneath our tree  
How can I truly be angry with you?  
All you want is to be part of me  
You love like no human could  
You love like no human should  
Poison, the poison, I taste on your lips  
Makes the apple red  
Wouldn't you love if I fell like Snow White  
Slumbered in your bed?  
You love like no human could  
You love like no human should  
You love like no human could  
You love like no human should  
Are you poison?  
Are you poison?  
Are you poisoning me?  
Are you poison?  
Are you poison?  
Are you poisoning me?  
Are you poison?  
Are you poison?  
Are you poisoning me?  
How can I truly be mad  
When all that you want is to be  
When all that you want is to be  
Part of me, me, me?  

You call me a mountain  
And I call you the sea  
I'll stand tall and certain  
And watch you swallow me  
  
You can move me if you want to  
You can move a mountain, you can move a mountain  
You can move me if you want to  
You can move everything, you can move everything  
  
I will grow my own trees  
While you follow the moon  
I feel you in my knees  
Say you'll come in soon  
  
You can move me if you want to  
You can move a mountain, you can move a mountain  
You can move me if you want to  
You can move everything, you can move everything  
  
But then one day you'll go away, but I will too  
But until then, oh my darling friend, well I will hold  
Yes I will hold, yes I will hold  
Yes I will hold on to you  
  
You can move me if you want to  
You can move a mountain, you can move a mountain  
You can move me if you want to  
You can move everything, you can move everything

Oh what a day is today  
Nothing can stand in my way  
Now that you've shipped out from under my skin  
I think I'm ready to win  
  
Oh what a night is tonight  
I think I'm ready to fight  
Now that my broken bones all have been healed  
I think I'm starting to feel  
  
Something good  
Something good  
Now that you're gone I can roll on to something good  
  
Oh what a way that we die  
Plenty of tears were supplied  
My eyes are wrung out and dry as a bone  
And I taste much better alone  
  
Something good  
Something good  
Now that you're gone I can roll onto something good  
  
Oh you know I moved away  
From the other side of the door  
I don't have to wait anymore for you to come home  
Something good  
Now that you're gone I can roll on to something good  
Something good

Don't delay, something tells me I gotta go away  
Maybe it's the way we always stay when our hearts have gone  
We can't hold us anymore, no we've got to fold  
Down to the floor, yes I know it's cold but baby our hearts have gone  
  
Just because there once was love  
Don't mean a thing, don't mean a thing  
Just because there once was love  
Don't mean a thing, don't mean a thing  
  
Just because there once was love  
Don't mean a thing, don't mean a thing  
Just because there once was love  
  
I gotta see if I'm filled up when it's only me  
It's not your fault but you just can't be here  
Now that my heart has gone, now that my heart has gone  
Now that my heart has gone  
  
Just because there once was love  
Don't mean a thing, don't mean a thing  
Just because there once was love  
Don't mean a thing, don't mean a thing  
  
Just because there once was love  
Don't mean a thing, don't mean a thing  
Just because there once was love  
  
Everyone is hurting now and everything is burning down  
But I can build back my new town today  
  
Just because there once was love  
Don't mean a thing, don't mean a thing  
Just because there once was love  
Don't mean a thing, don't mean a thing  
  
Just because there once was love  
Don't mean a thing, don't mean a thing  
Just because there once was love  
  
There once was love, there once was love  
There once was love, there once was love  
There once was love, there once was love  
There once was love, there once was love

Nobody wants to be the only one left standing  
Nobody wants to be the only one to understand  
And now I'm seeing the way that you're leaving  
Without me  
  
Now go on and drift away  
The tide can hold you out  
Go quiet now  
Go sound go safe  
Open hands are hard to hold onto anyway  
Anyway  
  
Everybody wants the world to make them live forever  
And nobody wants to be the only one to sit and paint  
And now I'm seeing the way that you're leaving  
Without me  
  
Now go on and drift away  
The tide can hold you out  
Go quiet now  
Go sound go safe  
Open hands are hard to hold onto anyway  
Anyway  
  
Now go on and drift away  
The tide can hold you out  
Go quiet now  
Go sound go safe  
Open hands are hard to hold on to  
Anyway, open hands are hard to hold on to  
Anyway, open hands are hard to hold on to  
Anyway, anyway, anyway

I don't tell anyone about the way you hold my hand  
I don't tell anyone about the things that we have planned  
I won't tell anybody, won't tell anybody  
They wanna push me down, they wanna see you fall down  
  
Won't tell anybody that you turn the world around  
I won't tell anyone that your voice is my favorite sound  
I won't tell anybody, won't tell anybody  
They wanna see us fall, they wanna see us fall down  
  
I don't need a parachute baby if I've got you  
Baby, if I've got you I don't need a parachute  
You're gonna catch me, you're gonna catch if I fall  
(Down, down, down)  
  
Don't believe the things you tell yourself so late at night  
You are your own worst enemy, you'll never win the fight  
Just hold on to me, I'll hold onto you  
It's you and me up against the world, it's you and me  
  
I don't believe anything, don't trust anyone anymore  
But I believe you when you say we're never gonna fall  
Hand behind my neck, arm around my waist  
Never let me hit the ground, you'll never let me crash down  
  
I don't need a parachute baby if I've got you  
Baby, if I've got you I don't need a parachute  
You're gonna catch me, you're gonna catch if I fall  
(Down, down, down)  
  
I don't need a parachute baby if I've got you  
Baby, if I've got you I don't need a parachute  
You're gonna catch me, you're gonna catch if I fall  
(Down, down, down)  
  
I won't fall out of love  
I won't fall out of...  
I won't fall out of love  
I won't fall out of...  
I won't fall out of love  
I won't fall out of...  
I won't fall out of love  
I won't fall out of...  
I'll fall into you  
  
I won't fall out of love  
I won't fall out of...  
I won't fall out of love  
I won't fall out of...  
I won't fall out of love  
I won't fall out of...  
I won't fall out of love  
I won't fall out of...  
I'll fall into you  
  
I don't need a parachute baby if I've got you  
Baby, if I've got you I don't need a parachute  
You're gonna catch me, you're gonna catch if I fall  
(Down, down, down)  
  
I don't need a parachute baby if I've got you  
Baby, if I've got you I don't need a parachute  
You're gonna catch me, you're gonna catch if I fall  
(Down, down, down)  
  
I don't need a parachute baby if I've got you  
Baby, if I've got you I don't need a parachute  
You're gonna catch me, you're gonna catch if I fall down

"Follow your heart", he said  
Your heart will take you there  
"Swallow your pride", he said  
For pride is anything but rare  
So I walked into your eyes  
Without a raincoat on  
And in the salty sea  
I find you're all but gone  
Take my hand, you're treading water  
And I feel sand slipping away  
From underneath our toes  
Nobody knows where is it she goes?  
Looked in the bathroom stall  
Your back against the wall  
Cold tiles beneath your knees  
Your body broke your fall  
Spitting into your own  
Reflection gazing back  
Inside your porcelain fists  
Your palms begin to crack  
So take my hand you're treading water  
And I feel sand slipping  
From underneath our toes  
Nobody knows where is it she goes?  
When those sad eyes start to close  
Nobody knows where is it she goes?  
When those sad eyes close  

I'm sitting pretty and I don't know why  
I found somebody, said he'd make me fly  
Wrapped me up in ribbons then he left me to die  
Wrapped me up in ribbons then he left me to die  
  
Told me he'd hold me 'til there was no more  
Told me that he'd love me from the top to the floor  
Wrapped me up in ribbons then he went for the door  
Wrapped me up in ribbons then he went for the door  
  
All the time he takes are the words that he breaks  
All the time he takes are the words that he breaks  
  
I'm not flying  
I'm not flying am I  
I'm not flying so damn high in the sky  
I'm not flying  
I'm not flying am I  
I'm not flying am I  
  
You look so pretty in the dark of night  
But I'm getting wise in the early light  
I can see you falling like a homemade kite  
I can see you falling like a homemade kite  
  
You put your Sunday best on for us all  
Painting up a promise that you know will fall  
Wrap me in your ribbons tie me to the wall  
Wrap me in your ribbons tie me to the wall  
  
All the time he takes are the words that he breaks  
All the time he takes are the words that he breaks  
  
I'm not flying  
I'm not flying am I  
I'm not flying so damn high in the sky  
I'm not flying  
I'm not flying am I  
I'm not flying am I  
  
You walk on everybody  
You walk on everyone  
You walk right up and you ask me to dance  
You ask me to dance  
You ask me to dance then you walk away  
  
I'm not flying  
I'm not flying am I  
I'm not flying so damn high in the sky  
I'm not flying  
I'm not flying am I  
I'm not flying am I

You've made me into someone  
Who should not hold a loaded gun  
And now you sit upon my chest  
Knock out my wind, knock out my best  
  
And so long to no disasters and mornings too  
And so long to ever afters, so long to you  
  
I am soft for only you  
Impale me with your tongue, it's true  
And slices of me piled sky high  
The same old me to the naked eye  
But I can't find myself tonight  
  
And so long to no disasters and mornings too  
And so long to ever afters, so long to you

I don't believe in anything but myself  
I don't believe in anything but myself  
But then you opened up a door, you opened up a door  
Now I start to believe in something else  
  
But how do I know if I'll make it through?  
How do I know? Where's the proof in you?  
  
And so it goes, this soldier knows  
The battle with the heart isn't easily won  
And so it goes, this soldier knows  
The battle with the heart isn't easily won  
But it can be won  
  
I sit in the back of a bus watching the world grow old  
Watching the world go by all by myself  
I took a faith full leap and packed up all my things and  
All my love and gave it to somebody else  
  
But how do I know if I'll make it through?  
How do I know? Where's the proof in you?  
  
And so it goes, this soldier knows  
The battle with the heart isn't easily won  
And so it goes, this soldier knows  
The battle with the heart isn't easily won  
But it can be won, but it can be won  
But it can be won, but it can be won  
  
And so it goes, this soldier knows  
The battle with the heart isn't easily won  
And so it goes, this soldier knows  
The battle with the heart isn't easily won  
  
And so it goes, this soldier knows  
(And so it goes)  
The battle with the heart isn't easily won  
(The war is won)  
  
And so it goes, this soldier knows  
(And so it goes)  
The battle with the heart isn't easily won  
(The war is won)  
But it can be won, but it can be won

Baby you've got the sort of hands to rip me apart  
And baby you've got the sort of face to start this old heart  
But your eyes are warning me this early morning  
That my love's too big for you my love  
  
Baby you've got the sort of laugh that waters me  
And makes me grow tall and strong and proud and flattens me  
I find you stunning, but you are running me down  
My love's too big for you my love  
My love's too big for you my love  
  
And if I was stronger then I would tell you no  
And if I was stronger then I will leave this show  
And if I was stronger then I would up and go  
But here I am and here we go again  
  
Baby you've got the sort of eyes that tell me tales  
That your sort of mouth just will not say, the truth impales  
That you don't need me, but you won't leave me  
My love's too big for you my love  
My love's too big for you my love  
  
And if I was stronger then I would tell you no  
And if I was stronger then I will leave this show  
And if I was stronger then I would up and go  
But here I am and here we go again  
  
Tell me what to do to take away the you?  
  
And if I was stronger then I would tell you no.  
And if I was stronger then I will leave this show  
And if I was stronger then I would up and go  
But here I am and here we go again

I want to crawl back inside my mother's womb  
I want to shut out all the lights in this room  
I want to start fresh, like a baby in a sink  
Scrub away all these thoughts that I think of you  
  
So life moves slowly when you're waiting for it to boil,  
Feel like I watch from six feet under the soil  
Still, want to hold you and kiss behind your ears,  
But I recount the countless tears that I lost for you  
  
But before you finally go there's one thing you should know, that I promise...  
  
[Chorus]  
Starting now, I'll never know your name  
Starting now, I'll never feel the same  
Starting now, I wish you never came into my world  
  
I want to crawl back inside my bed of sin  
I want to burn the sheets that smell like your skin  
Instead I'll wash them just like kitchen rags with stains  
Spinning away every piece that remains of you  
  
But before you finally go there's one thing you should know, that I promise...  
  
[Chorus]  
Starting now, I'll never know your name  
Starting now, I'll never feel the same  
Starting now, I wish you never came into my world  
  
It's my world, it's not ours anymore  
It's my world, it's not ours anymore  
  
[Chorus]  
Starting now, I'll never know your name  
Starting now, I'll never feel the same  
Starting now, I wish you never came into my world

The sky looks pissed  
The wind talks back  
My bones are shifting in my skin  
And you my love are gone  
  
My room seems wrong  
The bed won't fit  
I cannot seem to operate  
And you my love are gone  
  
So glide away on soapy heels  
And promise not to promise anymore  
And if you come around again  
Then I will take, then I will take the chain from off the door  
  
I'll never say I'll never love  
But I don't say a lot of things  
And you my love are gone  
  
So glide away on soapy heels  
And promise not to promise anymore  
And if you come around again  
Then I will take, then I will take the chain from off the door

If you were falling, then I would catch you  
You need a light, I'd find a match  
'Cause I love the way you say good morning  
And you take me the way I am  
  
If you are chilly, here take my sweater  
Your head is aching, I'll make it better  
'Cause I love the way you call me baby  
And you take me the way I am  
  
I'd buy you Rogaine if you start  
Losing all your hair  
Sew on patches to all you tear  
  
'Cause I love you more than  
I could ever promise  
And you take me the way I am  
You take me the way I am  
You take me the way I am

It's a wonder at all that I'm alive  
It's a wonder at all that I'm still standing  
It's a wonder at all that I survived the war  
  
Between your, between your heart and mine  
Between your, between your heart and mine  
  
I won't surrender  
I will fight better  
You lock me out, you knock me down  
But I will find my way around  
I won't surrender  
This is war  
  
It's a wonder at all that I can see  
It's a wonder at all that the sky is not falling down  
It's a wonder at all that I decide to breathe  
Anymore anymore anymore  
  
I won't surrender  
I will fight better  
You lock me out, you knock me down  
But I will find my way around  
I won't surrender  
This is war  
This is war  
  
This is war, this is war  
I will run until I can't run anymore  
Someone's got to lose  
It's not gonna be this girl this time  
  
I won't surrender  
I will fight better  
You lock me out you knock me down  
But I will find my way around  
I won't surrender  
I will fight better  
And this is war  
This is war

Let's take a better look  
Beyond a story book  
And learn our souls are all we own  
Before we turn to stone  
  
Let's go to sleep with clearer heads  
And hearts too big to fit out beds  
And maybe we won't feel so alone  
Before we turn to stone  
  
And if you wait for someone else's hand  
You will surely fall down  
If you wait for someone else's hand  
You'll fall, you'll fall  
  
I know that I am nothing new  
There's so much more than me and you  
But brother how we must atone  
Before we turn to stone

I did what I did for you I did what I could  
I did what I don't know how  
You did what you did for you you did what you would  
I don't know I don't know now  
  
My life will grow my love will go  
My life will go, my love will grow  
  
Without you  
Without you  
Without you  
Without you  
  
Everything moves save for me everything will move  
I just don't know how to know  
But somebody will make me fall somebody will try  
Then I will just go and go  
  
My life will grow my love will go  
My life will go, my love will grow  
  
Without you  
Without you  
Without you  
Without you  
Go, go, go, just go go go  
Go, go, go, just go go go  
  
Without you  
Without you  
Without you  
Without you  
Without you  
Without you

Don't you worry, there my honey  
We might not have any money  
But we've got our love to pay the bills  
  
Maybe I think you're cute and funny,  
Maybe I wanna do what bunnies do with you,  
If you know what I mean  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, let's get rich and buy our parents homes in the South of France  
Let's get rich and give everybody nice sweaters  
And teach them how to dance  
Let's get rich and build our house on a mountain  
Making everybody look like ants  
From way up there, you and I, you and I, you and I,  
  
Well you might be a bit confused  
And you might be a little bit bruised  
But baby how we spoon like no one else  
So I will help you read those books  
If you will soothe my worried looks  
And we will put the lonesome on the shelf  
  
[Chorus: x2]

When I hear voice over the radio  
From a world away, so sweet  
Singing up to me, I know it's a lullaby  
And I'm tangled in thoughts of you  
And I'm all alone, till you come back home  
Why don't you come back home?  
  
You got me  
You got me good  
You got me  
You got me good, good, good  
  
And when I see the curve of the earth in your willow eyes  
I'm a rocketeer, coming home after years at the speed of light  
Suddenly you're there, like a pearl in the palm of the universe  
Your unlikely skies filling up my eyes  
You come as some surprise,  
  
You got me  
You got me good  
You got me  
You got me good, good, good  
You got me good  
  
I was nailed shut like a shack on the edge of town  
You were broken down  
'Til you came around  
  
You got me  
You got me  
You got me  
You got me good  
You got me  
You got me  
You got me  
You got me good  
You got me good  
You got me good  
You got me good
