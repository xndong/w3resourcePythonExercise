I lay down with an angel  
I lay down with an angel  
?Cause she treat me kind sometimes  
Vieni in me, portami via, ali d?oro  
Vieni in me  
Fammi volare, mio cielo  
Siamo l?inganno, portami via  
Anima mia, oh mia  
I lay down with an angel  
I lay down with an angel  
I lay down, I lay down thinking  
More than I could really say  
Stai in me  
Continua a volare, ali d?oro  
Siamo l?inganno  
Baciami il cuore  
Anima mia, oh mia  
I lay down with an angel  
I lay down with an angel  
I lay down, I lay down thinking  
More than I could really say  
Vedo nel sole dei tuoi occhi  
Un altro sole cadere  
Siamo l?addio e non la fine  
Senza ricordi ne? paure  
Uh baby, portami via  
I lay down with an angel  
I lay down, ooh, with an angel  
Lay me down, I lay down  
I lay down thinking  
More than I could really say  
I lay down with an angel  
I lay down, sweet, with an angel  
Lay, I lay down  
I lay down thinking  
Baby, more than I could really say  
Really say  

The shadow dance  
Is ready now to take us over  
I don't know why  
I don't know why  
  
The moon's alive  
The sun has gone and run for cover  
Burning blind  
Burning blind  
  
Darkness waits  
I'm dancing with the devil's lover  
To pass the time  
To pass the time  
  
And all of this is just a game  
We tell each other  
Alleluja  
She'll always try to rule ya  
  
She'll be laughing, at the night  
But don't you let that fool ya  
She said she came from far away  
To find a lover  
  
I don't know why  
I don't know why  
She said she knew  
That we would always be together  
  
And then she cried  
And then she cried  
I spend my nights in wonder  
If I'll ever know her  
  
She's in my mind  
She's in my mind  
She laughs and turns smiles  
And blushes like a flower  
  
Alleluja  
She'll always try to rule ya  
She'll be laughing  
Lauging at the night  
  
Alleluja  
You'll need to find the answer  
Bur neon doesn't shed  
That kind of light  
  
But don't you let that fool ya

Ci vuole qualche cosa  
Qualche cosa di piu'  
Ci vuole un po' di pushing pushing  
Quando il sole va', il sole va' giu'  
Ci vedi qualche cosa  
Di positivo in un no  
Ci vuole un po' di catching funky  
Quando il sole no, il sole non ho  
Oh yeah yeah  
Ci vuole qualcheduno  
Che mi ami di piu'  
Ci vuole un po' di pushing pushing  
Quando il sole va', il sole va' giu'  
Ci vuole un'altra cosa  
Forse un'Ave Maria  
Ci vuole un po' di mercy mercy  
Quando il sole va', il sole va' via  
Baby don't cry  
Make it funky  
Pane e vino io ti portero'  
Miele e venere su dai campi  
Che c'ho l'anima nel fondo del Po  
Ci vuole quella cosa  
Che ci manca di piu'  
Che siamo quasi tutti ai frutti  
Quando il sole va', il sole va' giu'  
Ma vedi qualche cosa  
Di positivo in un mai  
Ci vuole un po' di mercy mercy  
Quando il sole no, il sole non hai  
Baby, don't cry  
Make it funky  
Pane e vino io ti portero'  
Miele e venere su dai campi  
Che c'ho l'anima nel fondo del Po  
Baby, don't cry

Pane e vino portero' x te  
Miele e venere x tutti quanti  
Che c'ho l'anima nel fondo del Po

Ecco cos'e' vivere  
Bacco perbacco  
Dimmi dov'e' venere  
Baby, don't cry  
Make it funky  
Pane e vino io ti portero'  
Miele e venere su dai campi

Make it funky  
Pane e vino portero' per te  
Miele e venere x tutti quanti  
Che c'ho l'anima nel fondo del Po  
Che c'ho l'anima nel fondo del Po  

Girl, I surrender, that's no lie  
You don't remember, how I tried  
All I can dream, all I say  
  
Don't make it better  
Walking around with a brick in my head  
Hanging around, still trying to make it better  
Thinking by now, that I'm sick in the head  
'Cause it's everything that you don't want  
Give you everything, but you don't care  
Girl, I love you, but you say you don't  
Hell it's everything that you don't want  
  
Girl, it's a wonder, I survived  
You are the hunger, burning my insides  
Living your dream, call my name  
  
I'll make it better  
Walking around with a brick in my head  
Hanging around, still trying to make it better  
Thinking by now, that I'm sick in my head  
'Cause it's everything that you don't want  
Give you everything, but you don't care  
Girl, I love you, but you say you don't  
Hell it's everything that you don't want  
  
Wait a minute, you got a noose around my heart  
Come on, come on, come on, squeeze  
All that your breaking is my heart  
Your gonna freeze it, baby you've gone so cold!  
  
(Girl, I surrender)  
Walking around with a brick in my head  
Hanging around, still trying to make it better  
(Girl, I surrender)  
Thinking by now, that I'm sick my head  
'Cause it's everything that you don't want  
(Girl, I surrender)  
I give you everything, but you don't care  
Girl, I love you, but you say you don't  
(Girl, I surrender)  
And it's everything that you don't want  
Oh yeah, it's everything that you don't want

I'll be brave this time  
Cause it's everything that you don't want

Giving you everything but you don't care  
Girl, I love you, but you say you don't  
(Girl, I surrender)  
It's everything that you don't want  
It's all everything that you don't want  
(Girl, I surrender)  
  
That's a lie girl  
That's no lie girl  
(Girl, I surrender)  
That's all I'll say  
'Cause it's everything that you don't want  
(Girl, I surrender)  
It's everything that you don't want  
I give you everything but you don't care  
Walking around with a brick in my head

Small town Romeo, kicking cans down the street  
Coca-Cola van broke down in the heat  
The girls in colored dresses  
They seem to laugh as they run, yeah  
But they dream of only sweet caresses  
  
Come back the sun  
We will be like children  
Come back the sun  
Make us into children  
  
Black and white of summer, and the golden light  
The way we touched each other in the stolen night  
The voices whisper in darkness  
Dusty shoes on our feet, tender  
And on my way to tomorrow, I remember  
  
Come back the sun  
We will be like children  
Come back the sun  
Make us into children  
  
So you say that I'm dreaming  
Beauty is mine  
If I'm only dreaming, then it's fine  
[Incomprehensible]  
  
Bring back the sun in my life  
I need your love to be there, baby  
Bring back the sun in my life  
  
Bring back the sun in my life  
I need your love to be there, baby  
Bring back the sun in my life  
Well, you don't care  
  
Come back the sun  
We will be like children  
Come back the sun  
Make us into children  
  
Come back the sun  
We will be like children  
When I was a kid  
I could bring back the sun  
  
Come back the sun  
Come back the sun

Gloria nell'alto dei cieli  
Ma non see'e' pace quaggiu'  
Non ho bisogno di veli  
Sei gia' un angelo tu  
Che accendi un diavolo in me  
Accendi un diavolo in me  
Perche' see'e' un diavolo in me, baby  
Forse see'e' un diavolo in me  
Le strade delle signore  
Sono infinite lo sai  
Anch'io ti sono nel cuore  
E allora cosa mi fai  
Accendi un diavolo in me  
Accendi un diavolo in me  
Perche' see'e' un diavolo in me, Baby  
Forse see'e' un diavolo in me  
Saluta I tuoi e bacia I miei  
Che sensazione  
Spengo cicche  
Tu accendi me, che confusione.  
Dai che non siamo dei santi  
Le tentazioni del suolo  
Sono cose piccanti  
Belle da prendere al volo  
E accendi un diavolo in me  
Accendi un diavolo in me  
Perche' see'e' un diavolo in me, Baby  
Forse see'e' un diavolo in me  
Gloria nell'alto dei cieli  
Ma non see'e' pace quaggiu'  
E' una questione di peli  
Sei proprio un angelo tu  
Che accendi un diavolo in me  
Accendi un diavolo in me  
Perche' see'e' un diavolo in me, baby  
Forse see'e' un diavolo in me  
Accendi un diavolo in me  
Accendi un diavolo in me  
Perche' see'e' un diavolo in me baby  
Forse see'e' un diavolo in me

What's it cost you, darling?  
What's it cost you, darling?  
What's it cost you? What's it cost you?  
Not very much  
  
I got no people here on my boat  
Just a hot jug of wine and a net full of hope  
I got no money but I'm still afloat  
Lost my luck to the wind so I row and I row  
  
I got this girl who waits back on the shore, oh, Lord  
Sees me row, says she don't know what for, that's all  
Ain't got no fish when I'm at her door  
But in the morning when I leave she's begging for more, and more  
  
I got no people here on my boat  
Just a hot jug of wine and a net full of hope, that's all  
I got no money but I'm still afloat  
Lost my luck to the wind so I row and I row, yeah  
  
This cat and mouse game surely must end, oh, Lord  
Catch all the fish, who'll left to be friends? That's all  
Back home it's too tough I can't cope  
But in the land of fish, I know someday I will be home  
  
I got no people here on my boat  
Just a hot jug of wine and a net full of hope, I do know  
I got no money but I'm still afloat  
Lost my luck to the wind so I row and I row  
  
What's it cost you, darling?  
What's it cost you, darling?  
What's it cost you? What's it cost you?  
Not very much  
  
Everybody must get drunk  
  
I got no people here on my boat

Ho sei cose nella mente  
E tu non ci sei piu'  
Mi dispiace  
Guardo dentro gli occhi della gente  
Cosa cerco non so  
Forse un uomo  
Hey man  
Che cammini come me  
Dall'altra parte della strada  
Hey man  
Che sei solo come me  
Dall'altra parte della strada  
Canta e passa la malinconia  
Se si canta in due  
Passa meglio  
Hey fratello di una notte d'estate  
Ci facciamo un po'  
Compagnia  
Hey man  
Che cammini come me  
Dall'altra parte della strada  
Hey man  
Vieni e canta insieme a me  
Da questa parte della strada  
Che ci facciamo compagnia  
Guardo dentro agli occhi della gente  
Cosa cerco lo so  
Un altro uomo  
Hey fratello di una notte d'estate  
Ci facciamo un po'  
Compagnia  
Hey man  
Che cammini come me  
Dall'altra parte della strada  
Hey man  
Vieni e canta insieme a me  
Da questa parte della strada  
Hey man  
Che sei solo come me  
Dall'altra parte della strada  
Hey man  
Vieni e canta insieme a me  
Da questa parte della strada  
Che ci facciamo compagnia  

Taking time to find myself  
Seeing how I've been so crazy  
Still I don't love you  
Being in love has been my crime  
My heart beats have been so lazy  
Still I don't love you  
I've been lost this time with feelings  
Do you know my mind?  
I don't  
  
And I don't know why  
And I don't know how  
And I don't know  
  
And I want no lies  
But I don't know why  
And I don't know  
I don't know  
  
When I ran away to hide  
Then I made a thousand changes  
I'm sorry I don't love you  
Thinking of the pain inside  
And the way it always tasted  
Sorry I don't love you  
I've been thinking more about you  
And I know my mind's....crazy  
  
And I don't know why  
And I don't know how  
And I don't know  
  
And I want no lies  
Am I'm never gonna know why?  
Why I don't love you  
  
I lied in fear  
Like a little child  
And I don't know why  
  
Now I have to cry  
Tears are gonna tell you why  
Why I don't love you  
I don't know....  
  
(whispered) I'll never leave you  
  
And I don't know why  
And I don't know how  
And I don't know  
  
And I want no lies  
Am I'm never gonna know why?  
Why I don't love you....yeah  
  
I lied in fear  
Like a little child  
Yet I don't know why  
  
Now I have to cry  
Tears are gonna tell you why  
Why I don't love you....yeah  

Standing alone in the night  
People talk around me  
Under the neon street light  
Tryin' hard to hold on  
I need somebody's love to  
Surround me  
Tossing a coin in the air  
Making my decision  
What has gone wrong with my life  
I've drunk all my religion  
I need somebody's love  
To remind me  
I won't be lonely tonight  
All I want's another baby  
I won't be lonely tonight  
All I need's another baby  
Heads I leave town in the night  
Tails I drink a bottle  
If it should land on its side  
I'll return to love you  
I need somebody's life to  
Surround me  
I won't be lonely tonight  
All I want's another baby  
I won't be lonely tonight  
All I need's another baby  
And this is the last time  
I wanna be  
I'm gonna be  
I won't be lonely tonight  
All I want's another baby  
I won't be lonely tonight  
All I need's another baby  

Ho camminato per le strade  
col sole dei tuoi occhi  
ci vuole un attimo per dirsi addio...spara  
Che bella quiete sulle cime  
mi freddi il cuore e l'anima  
ci vuole un attimo x dirsi addio...  
X questo troppo amore, per noi  
e questo bel dolore  
Ti prego no, ti prego lo sai!  
Sogno, qualcosa di buono  
che mi illumini il mondo  
buono come te...  
Che ho bisogno, di qualcosa di vero  
che illumini il cielo  
proprio come te!!!  
Ho visto il sole nei tuoi occhi  
calare nella sera  
ci vuole un attimo x dirsi addio...spara  
Che bella quiete sulle rive  
mi freddi il cuore e l'anima  
ci vuole un attimo x dirsi...addio!  
Ma dove andranno i giorni e noi  
le fughe e poi i ritorni  
ti prego no, ti prego lo sai!  
Sogno, qualcosa di buono...  
Siamo caduti in volo  
Mio sole  
siamo caduti in volo!  
Siamo caduti in volo  
Mio cielo  
siamo caduti in volo!  
Baby don't cry, baby don't cry  
Baby don't cry, baby don't cry, baby don't cry  
X questo amore immenso, x noi  
e il gran dolore che sento  
ti prego no, ti prego lo sai!  
  
Sogno, qualcosa di buono...

I've got something to tell you  
About my heart,  
That you hold  
If you're down well there's someone there  
Don't you know  
  
Well you know there's a place  
Way down deep  
Where I hide  
I'm in trouble  
  
It's a garden I keep  
You don't know  
You can't find  
I'm in trouble  
  
I hold you close  
You turn away  
  
You know what I want to say  
  
After this love  
After the rain  
After our river's run  
  
You'll fill my eyes  
With silver rays  
And with a golden sun  
  
I'm still here  
Unafraid  
If you don't come  
Oh, I'm in trouble.  
  
What do you think about me?  
What do you think about me?  
  
Well you know part of me is  
Deep in you  
You don't want  
All my trouble  
  
Won't walk out  
I want to stay  
  
I'd light up your heart  
If I found the way  
  
After this love  
After the rain  
After our river's meet  
  
You'll fill my eyes  
With silver curves  
And golden memories  
  
I'm still here  
Unafraid  
Won't you please come  
  
After this love  
After this crying  
After the stars all fall  
  
You'll fill my eyes  
With tears of joy  
We'll laugh about it all  
  
I'm still here  
Unafraid  
If you don't come  
  
Oh no no, I'm in trouble

In this world - I am gonna walk  
Until my feet - refuse to take me any longer  
Yes I'm gonna walk - and walk some more  
And I will ask - everyone I meet  
  
Ask 'til they tell me - there's no answers anymore  
Yes I'm gonna ask - more and some more  
And I will love somebody somewhere  
'Til my heart breaks - until it's done  
  
Until it explodes - from out of nowhere  
Like the sun - like the sun  
In this world - I am gonna sing  
Until my voice - won't be singing any longer  
  
Yes I'm gonna sing - more and some more  
And I will love somebody somewhere  
'Til my heart breaks - until it's done  
Until it explodes - from out of nowhere  
  
Like the sun - like the sun  
I will be looking - at everyone  
Until my eyes - refuse to see them any longer  
And though it hurts me so - gonna keep on looking  
  
Looking looking at me  
And I will love somebody somewhere  
'Til my heart breaks - until it's done  
Until it explodes - from out of nowhere  
  
Like the sun - like the sun  
In this world - I will love no more  
So love can't hurt me - hurt me any longer

Heading homeward, home I cannot find, oh love  
Heading home yet I'm lost inside the night  
I may be strong but without you I may fall, oh love  
Betrayed and lost now I cannot hear you call  
  
I will seek you longer  
'Til your scent grows stronger  
  
Still I wish you here as I've been  
Lost for a long, long, long time  
Lost in the rain  
I'm growin' so tired  
  
Still I wish you here as  
I'm lost in the lone, lone, lone night  
Erasin' me, erasin' my world  
  
The night is open a door I will not close to you  
I wait outside and long for a taste of home  
So call out louder than this wind may blow, oh love  
Betrayed and lost now I feel my hunger grow  
  
I will seek you longer  
'Til your scent grows stronger  
  
Still I wish you here as I've been  
Lost for a long, long, long time  
Lost in the rain I'm growin' so tired  
  
Still I wish you here as I'm  
Lost in the lone, lone, lone night  
Erasin' me, erasin' my world  
  
I will seek you longer  
For you scent I hunger  
  
Come here, come on  
Tonight's open for you and I  
A night of tender petting  
Of doors open wide  
  
I need somebody to love  
I need somebody to love  
I need somebody to love  
I need somebody to love  
  
(I need somebody to love)  
Amore in mano al vento  
(I need somebody to love)  
Lost in the rain  
(I need somebody to love)  
I'm growin' so tired  
(I need somebody to love)  
  
I need somebody to love  
(I need somebody to love)  
I need somebody to love  
(I need somebody to love)  
  
I need somebody to love  
(I need somebody to love)  
I need somebody to love  
(I need somebody to love)  
  
I need somebody to love  
(I need somebody to love)

Nothin' is shakin'  
Nothin' but me and the rent  
Jesus is breaking  
Why'm I back here again?  
Can't find my soul, oh no  
Not since I don't know when  
Lost in a hurricane  
Still I go on  
  
Nothin' is shakin'  
Nothin' but me and the rent  
My heart is aching  
I'm 'bout as bad as it gets  
I love you because I need to  
Not 'cause I needed you  
Lost in a hurricane  
Strugglin' on  
  
Mama! Salvami l'anima  
Mama! Salvami l'anima  
Mama! Salvami l'anima  
Mama! Saving my soul for me  
Saving my soul for me  
  
Nothin' is shakin'  
Nothin' but me and the rent  
Not 'cause I'm breaking  
I'm on my knees here again  
Madre dolcissima  
Caress my aching head  
Lost in a hurricane  
But I go on  
  
Mama! Salvami l'anima?  
Jesus is breaking  
Jesus is breaking  
Jesus is breaking  
Jesus is breaking  
Mama! Salvami l'anima?

Angels announce with trumpets  
Crown you with jewels and stars  
Hercules lives  
Next door to Venus and Mars  
Beside your pretty blue shoulder,  
  
Something may trouble Jerome  
Now that you're up with your friends  
I know you'll never come home  
  
Singing so babe, I know this song  
Miss Mary I'm nothing without you  
Everything I've done is wrong  
Miss Mary I try not to doubt you  
  
I walk in their brilliant parade  
Banish the primitive gloom  
Now I know where I can find you  
Hung up in some Frenchman's room  
Pitiful Magdelena for all to see  
Must have been beautiful  
So just show a little mercy to me  
  
Hey babe, I sing this song  
Miss Mary I'm nothing without you  
Everything I've done is wrong  
Miss Mary I try not to doubt you  
  
There at the foot of your staircase  
I stood to take in the scene  
All the ashes of roses  
The veined steps of marble  
Purple, gold and green  
Oh I wish you were my queen  
  
They only want to possess you  
Lock you away in a vault  
Such a heavenly vision  
And dress you up in blue  
I guess it's not their fault  
  
I know this song  
Miss Mary I'm nothing without you  
Everything I've done is wrong

Everything I've done is wrong  
Miss Mary will I be forgiven

Lecca le mie pene  
Begli occhioni blu  
Che la tristezza viene  
Dove succhia di piu  
Come un cane lecca le ferite  
Lecca le ferite  
Lecca le pene, di queste 2 vite  
Lecca le mie pene  
Ah non ci credo  
Che stanno tutti bene  
Non ci credo, non  
Forse la speranza  
E un serpente che danza  
Lecca le mie pene  
Accarezza le mie pene  
Begli occhioni blu  
E liberami dal male  
Ho il cuore perso laggiu  
Figlia della luce, oh, dammi pace  
Accarezza le mie pene  
Come un cane, lecca le ferite  
Lecca le mie pene  
Accarezza le mie pene  
Lecca le mie pene  
Accarezza le mie pene  
Lecca le mie pene  

If not tonight  
This is the strangest feeling  
Something I can't control  
Do I play the fool for you?  
  
If not tonight  
Waiting forever  
Just to see your face  
Waiting is all that I seem to do.  
  
Yeah puro amore  
Will another night exist like this again?  
Yeah solo amore  
We will never get this moment back  
Again?  
  
If not tonight  
Underneath the stars  
Beneath the crescent  
Sinking down into the sea  
It's not the time  
But I will wait forever  
If this is what you want  
Waiting could be the end of me  
  
Yeah puro amore  
Will another night exist like this again?  
Yeah solo amore  
We will never get this moment back  
Again?  
  
One day I will open your eyes  
Underneath the stars  
Beneath the crescent.  
  
Yeah puro amore  
Will another night exist like this again?  
Yeah solo amore  
We will never get this moment back  
Again?  
  
Yeah puro amore  
Let it be with you tonight  
There will never be a night?  
If not tonight?  
  
Tell me when, my love.

This ain't the way  
I spend my mornings, baby  
Come stai?  
You've been with him,  
And you've come back, lady  
Hei, what's he like?  
I just sit and watch the ocean  
With myself even I do my own cookin'  
You ca laugh, you're forgiven, but  
I'm no longer frightened to be livin'  
  
Senza una donna  
No more pain and no sorrow  
Without a woman  
I'll make it through tomorrow  
Senza una donna  
Givin me torture and bliss  
Without a woman  
Better like this  
  
There is no way  
That you can buy me, baby  
Don't make fun  
You got a dig, a little deeper, lady  
In your heart  
Yeah, if you have one  
Here's my heart, feel the power  
Look at me, I'm a flower  
You can laugh, you're forgiven, but  
I'm no longer frightened to be livin'  
  
Senza una donna  
No more pain and no sorrow  
Without a woman  
I'll make it through tomorrow  
Senza una donna  
Givin me torture and bliss  
Without a woman  
Better like this  
  
Oooh, I stay here and watch the ocean  
Don't know why, I keep on talkin'  
You may laugh, you're forgiven, but  
I'm no longer frightened, maybe, ti be livin'  
  
Senza una donna  
Without a woman  
Senza una donna  
Without a woman  
Vieni qui! Come on in  
Senza una donna  
I don't know what might follow  
Senza una donna  
Oh, maybe from tomorrow!  
Senza una donna  
Givin' me torture and bliss

Va pensiero sull'ali dorate  
Cross the mountains and fly over the oceans  
Reach the land find the place where all children grow  
Every night after listening to this lullaby  
There you find the heroes alive protecting the innocents  
Bless them all 'cause their simple song is so pure and wonderful  
Va pensiero sull'ali dorate  
Life's beautiful dream carry on for all night long  
Lead them your golden wings every feel will fly away  
Take them by the hand help them find an easy way  
Lead them back to the light back to the light  
Where they once used to belong  
Where they carry me children as long as they want  
Va pensiero sull'ali dorate  
Cross the mountains and fly over the oceans  
Reach the land find the place where all children grow  
Every night after listening to this lullaby  
Every night after listening to this lullaby  

Here I go out to sea again  
The sunshine fills my hair  
And dreams hang in the air  
Gulls in the sky and in my blue eyes  
You know it feels unfair  
There's magic everywhere  
Look at me standing  
Here on my own again  
Up straight in the sunshine  
No need to run and hide  
It's a wonderful wonderful life  
No need to laugh and cry  
It's a wonderful wonderful life  
The sun in your eyes  
The heat is in your hair  
They seem to hate you  
Because you're there  
I need is friend  
Oh I need a friend  
To make me happy  
Not stand here on my own  
Look at me standing  
Here on my own again  
Up straight in the sunshine  
No need to run and hide  
It's a wonderful wonderful life  
No need to laugh and cry  
It's a wonderful wonderful life  
I need a friend  
Oh I need a friend  
To make me happy  
Not so alone  
Look at me standing  
Here on my own again  
Up straight in the sunshine  
No need to run and hide  
It's a wonderful wonderful life  
No need to run and cry  
It's a wonderful wonderful life  
Wonderful life  
Wonderful life  
Wonderful life  

Funky gallo, come sono bello stamattina  
Non c'e piu la mia morosa e sono piu leggero di una piuma  
Oh e intanto Zio Rufus sta coi suoi pensieri in testa  
Portando in giro la vita a fare la pipi  
Per colpa di chi chi chi chi chichichirichi  
Stanotte voglio stare acceso e dire sempre di si  
Per colpa di chi chi chi chi chichichirichi  
I'm a hootchiee cootchiee man, hootchiee cootchiee man yeah  
Yeah, it's rolling  
Funky gallo, come sono in ballo questa sera  
Ho voglia di sudare e sono piu goloso di una mela  
Oh avanti o popolo con la chitarra rossa  
Che intanto il tempo passa e lei non torna piu  
Per colpa di chi chi chi chi chichichirichi  
Tieni il tempo, non ho tempo  
I wanna dance all night  
Il sentimento, e troppo denso  
I wanna dance all night  
Funky gallo, coi pensieri sconci nelle dita  
Forse sono in fallo, ma mi piace molto Madre Rita  
Oh avanti popolo con la lambretta rossa  
Che intanto il tempo passa e lei non torna piu  
Per colpa di chi chi chi chi chichichirichi  
Tieni il tempo, non ho tempo  
I wanna dance all night  
Il sentimento, e troppo denso  
I wanna dance all night  
Tieni il tempo, non ho tempo  
(Che)  
I wanna dance all night  
Sono in fiamme, le mie donne  
I wanna dance all night, fun time

I don't know why  
I'll never get the pain  
  
You make me feel loved

And the message you sent through invisible wire  
You make me feel all loved  
All this beautiful world and the sky is on fire  
  
I wanna take a trip back in time  
I wanna take a trip back in time  
(you make me feel loved)  
I wanna take a trip back in time

The snow is in the north  
The icy wind is blowing  
In seas that I don't know  
You're losing me babe  
My eyes are filled with crying  
For seven days now  
If you don't come back to me  
I feel the flood is coming  
You're losing me  
You're losing me  
You're losing me, yeah  
  
From deep into the night  
In seas that I don't know  
A hurricane is raging  
In my emotions  
The mist begins to rise  
You're losing me, babe  
My heart is ever changing  
For seven days now  
If you don't come back to me  
I see the flood is coming  
  
You're losing me  
You're losing me  
You're losing me  
  
Rain on my face is like a river  
All I can do is let it run  
Ice in my blood that makes me shiver  
I need your smile to bring me back the sun  
  
If you don't come back to me  
I see the flood is coming, yeah  
  
You're losing me...  

You've chosen me, oh no  
When it happens  
I've chosen you, I don't know  
When it happens  
  
Changes my life to a love song  
This love is so strong  
You've chosen me  
And now that I, I've  
  
I've chosen you  
Oh, oh, my love  
Let it happen  
Changing my life to a love song  
  
Changing my life to a love song  
This road is so long  
I'm a runaway train going off the rails  
My love is so strong  
  
I don't know why, if you  
You've chosen me  
Oh, pass my way  
If it happens
