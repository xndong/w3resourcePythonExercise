Closer you and I  
Gino Padilla  
  
Hey, there's a look in your eyes  
Must be love at first sight  
You were just part of a dream  
Nothing more so it seemed  
But my love couldn't wait much longer  
Just can't forget the picture of your smile  
'Cause everytime I close my eyes you come alive  
  
The closer I get to touching you  
The closer I get to loving you  
Give it a time, just a little more time  
We'll be together  
Every little smile, that special smile  
The twinkle in your eye, in a little while  
Give it a time, just a little more time  
So we can get closer, you and I  
  
Then could I love you more  
So much stronger than before  
Why does it seem like a dream  
So much more so it seems  
I guess I found my inspiration  
With just one smile, you take my breath away  
So hold me close and say you'll stay with me now  
  
The closer I get to touching you  
The closer I get to loving you  
Give it a time, just a little more time  
We'll be together  
Every little smile, that special smile  
The twinkle in your eye, in a little while  
Give it a time, just a little more time  
So we can get closer, you and I

I've got money to burn  
I've got life on the avenue  
I've got nothing to learn  
I just do what I want to do  
I've got places to go  
I've got lines on the telephone  
I've got nothing to show  
For all this time that I spend alone  
But if I wanted someone, someone to care  
And if I needed someone,  
Would you be there  
I want to look into your eyes  
(Chorus)  
And get a feel for your love  
(where would I be)  
I've got a feel for your love  
(where would I be)  
I've got a feel for your love  
(where would I go)  
I have something to give  
I got a feeling that I never knew  
I have a reason to live  
And all I want is to be with you  
If I gave you my heart  
Would you take what I have for you  
I have fallen so hard  
And I will do what you want me to  
And now I'm wanting someone  
Someone to share  
And if you are that someone  
Will you be there?  
So when I look into your eyes  
(Chorus)

Why do I live in the past and why should it hurt me to ask  
If someone can hear, I'm standing right here  
But this talking aloud cannot last  
  
I've never been one full of words,  
It's much better to hide in a smile  
With nothing to say, I'd just walk away  
Disappear to my room, and shake my fists  
Think things over and stare into the wall  
  
And all this time I feel like screaming  
Turn that key, let me out, let me out  
Let me hold onto someone  
Let me out, let me out  
Let me hold onto someone  
  
Inside it's so easy to breathe, but never so easy to leave  
And just when I try, the fence gets too high  
So I sleep with my head on my sleeve  
  
And I dream of us flying away to a place that is out of the way  
And there's somebody there who says I don't care  
Who you are, where you're from, what you need  
Or what you're thinking, we love you anyway  
  

I'm tired enough ooh I'm tired  
And I feel so weighed down  
I don't want failure while my whole life  
Waits around  
I need a love just like the rest  
And I've waited now so long  
I don't take what I can  
So I don't find love within  
Ooh give me a chance to show some affection  
Let something show  
I'm the one that said it I'm the one that needs you now  
  
Ooh give me love  
Give me love and laughter  
Give me love, love, love and laughter  
Give me love, give me love and laughter  
Give me love, love, love and laughter  
  
I'm with you now and that's all right  
But I need some more than your touch  
Show me where vour heart lies  
Now I feel like letting loose  
I could fall so easy for you  
And I wouldn't even try  
Your love lies lost in me  
Keep on kissing mine goodbye  
Ooh say the words say get lonely  
Just let me know  
You never will regret it  
And you'll never be lonely again  
  
Ooh give me love  
Give me love and laughter  
Give me love, love, love and laughter  
Give me love, give me love and laughter  
Give me love, love, love and laughter  
  
Love don't take it away  
Don't throw it away  
On somebody I know there's no one else  
Who needs you more than me  
  
Ooh give me love  
Give me love and laughter  
Give me love, love, love and laughter  
Give me love, give me love and laughter  
Give me love, love, love and laughter  
  

I can see the pain living in your eyes  
And I know how hard you try  
You deserve to have so much more  
I can feel your heart and I sympathize  
And I'll never criticize all you've ever meant to my life  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't want to let you down  
I don't want to lead you on  
I don't want to hold you back  
From where you might belong  
You would never ask me why  
My heart is so disguised  
I just can't live a lie anymore  
I would rather hurt myself  
Than to ever make you cry  
There's nothing left to say but good-bye  
You deserve the chance at the kind of love  
I'm not sure I'm worthy of  
Losing you is painful to me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You would never ask me why  
My heart is so disguised  
I just can't live a lie anymore  
I would rather hurt myself  
Than to ever make you cry  
There's nothing left to try  
Though it's gonna hurt us both  
There's no other way than to say good-bye

How does the time slip by so fast  
Why can't it once stand still  
For us this night, will always last  
With every breath until  
And if you find you're all alone  
Remember you have wings  
As long as there is air to breathe  
And music left unsung  
You know that in the darkest night  
A dawn has just begun  
So think of us, we'll think of you  
Together we'll take flight  
For we shall never say goodbye  
We only say goodnight  
For we shall never say goodbye  
We only say goodnight

It happened long ago  
When I felt the need  
For a life of my own  
I dreampt of summer love  
And moving high up north  
But no one would go  
So I walked up the hill and lay there  
Imagining the day was near  
I know I want to stay there  
And be a great pioneer  
  
I made a promise then  
That I'd find a place  
Where my world won't end  
Give me a piece of land  
That will be my life  
That I will defend  
If I work really hard  
I will surely survive  
I know my virtue is strong  
No one could oppose a spirit so raw  
To be a part of the state  
To be known as a great pioneer  
I keep the fires burning  
To let you know I'm free  
My heart will always be yearning  
  
To be, a part of the state  
To be, a part of the state  
To be, known as a great pioneer  
  
And if it all should end  
And I hear the call  
From the great unknown  
I'll need to go my way  
Let me have my day  
Let me be alone  
  
I was dreaming here and lay there  
Knowing that my time is here  
I know I wanna stay there  
  
To be, a part of the state  
To be, a part of the state  
To be, known as a great pioneer  
  

I came to you and never asked too much  
Wondering what you would say  
Hoping you'd understand  
It's not a role I usually play  
Don't speak too much of what's been going on  
The past is over and gone  
Give me your troubled mind  
You know it's due  
I can do so much for you  
  
I want you  
Having you near me, holding you near me  
I want you to stay and never go away  
It's so right  
Having you near me, holding you near me  
I'll love you tonight, it feels so right  
Feels so right  
  
You're brave to say that you get lost in love  
But you opened your heart to me  
Underneath all you feel you know  
How deep our love could be  
Tonight we'll touch until it's time to go  
Then I'm leaving it up to you  
Even a fool would know that I'm not through  
I can do so much for you  
  
I want you  
Having you near me, holding you near me  
I want you to stay and never go away  
It's so right  
Having you near me, holding you near me  
I'll love you tonight, it feels so right  
Feels so right

When you say I miss the things you do,  
I just want to get back close again to you.  
But for now your voice is near enough.  
How I miss you, and I miss you love.  
And though all the days that pass me by so slow,  
all the emptiness inside me flows all around,  
and there's no way out.  
I'm just thinkin' so much of you.  
There was never any doubt.  
  
I can wait forever if you say you'll be there too.  
I can wait forever if you will.  
I know it's worth it all to spend my life alone with you.  
  
When it looked as though my life was wrong,  
You took my love and gave it somewhere to belong.  
I'll be here when hope is out of sight.  
I just wish that I was next to you tonight.  
And oh, I'll be reaching for you even though  
You'll be somewhere else, my love.  
We'll go like a bird on its way back home.  
I could never let you go.  
And I just want you to know  
  
I can wait forever if you say you'll be there too.  
I can wait forever if you will.  
I know it's worth it all to spend my life alone with you.  
  
Where are you now,  
along with the thoughts we share?  
Keep them strong somehow.  
And you know I'll always be there.  
  
I can wait forever if you say you'll be there too.  
I can wait forever if you will.  
I know it's worth it all to spend my life alone with you.

Both of us are holding back  
So afraid to fall in love and lose again  
We've both been hurt before  
Saw love walk out the door  
In the end  
  
Actin' as cold as ice, when we wanna be  
It's just a foolish game we play  
You couldn't hurt me bad enough  
To make me give it up and walk away  
  
[Chorus]  
We can't stop, the feeling's too strong  
We've got the will to hang on  
Can't stop, we struggle and fight to survive  
Keepin' the love alive  
  
We try to forget the past, so many times  
It's hard to make those memories leave  
With all we have at stake  
We'll bend until we break  
Cause we both believe  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If we stand the test of time  
Love will be the lasting kind  
  
[Chorus]

Kiss me like you mean it  
Hold me like you never have before  
If you show a little feeliing  
I'll know that you can give a little more  
  
How can I take your love  
If you don't believe it  
Reach and and count those stars  
One by one  
  
[Chorus:]  
Ooh, kiss me like you mean it  
Ooh, Kiss me like you mean it  
  
Now is the time when words have no answer  
And silence is not what it seems  
We can fall from the sky in the presence of angels  
Do you dream the same dream?  
  
Always the sounds of love  
And a heart never ending  
For the colors that bleed and run...one by one  
  
[Chorus:]  
Where the water is deep the reflection is wide  
We stand on the bridge looking down  
But you can't decide  
True love will never begin to see  
So hold out your hand to me  
  
[Chorus:]

It was 9-29, 9-29 back street big city.  
The sun was going' down, there was music all around  
It felt so right.  
  
It was one of those nights, one of those nights when  
You feel the world stop turnin', you were standing  
There, there was music in the air. I should have been  
Away, but I knew I'd have to stay.  
  
Chorus:  
Last train to London, just headin' out,  
Last train to London, just leavin' town.  
But I really want tonight to last forever  
I really wanna be with you.  
Let the music play on down the line tonight.  
  
It was one of those nights, one of those nights when  
You feel the fire is burnin', everybody was there,  
Everybody to share, it felt so right.  
  
There you were on your own, lookin' like you were  
The only one around, I had to be with you,  
Nothin' else that I could do,  
I should have been away, but I knew I'd have to say.  
  
Chorus  
  
Underneath a starry sky, time was still but hours  
Must really have rushed by, I didn't realize  
But love was in your eyes I really should have  
Gone, but love went on and on...  
  
Chorus

LEARNING TO MAKE LOVE TO YOU  
I first felt it when I hit my teens  
Some things were changing  
It was deep inside of me  
I saw the Beatles and my body began to shake  
I started talking to the girl next door  
And she looked different than she ever did before  
And she was saying things that  
I could never tell  
So I was searching for the way in crowd  
With winklepickers and the music playing loud  
But all the kissing came from listening to If I Fell, I was ...  
(CHORUS)  
Learning to make love to you  
I'll do what you want me to  
Learning to make love to you  
I'll do what you want me to  
While we were grooving out Rubber Soul  
I was learning how to lose control  
I needed someone that was certain to hold me tight  
We were dancing until quarter to  
I missed the bus and so I turned to you  
I had the feeling that everything would be alright, I was ...  
(CHORUS)  
Everyone meets a new generation  
When the time is right  
All the kids want is an explanation  
When they say goodnight  
I can see you and me are just one to one and  
(CHORUS)  
  

I feel your hand in mine, I touch your skin  
Your heart is calling out  
You want to let me in, to let me in  
  
Your lips are silent now, we're not alone  
I'd like to tell you how much  
I'd like to take you home  
So I can make love to you  
  
I believe in you so  
And there's only one moment to live  
When you're here next to me  
There's so much more I have to give  
  
CHORUS  
When the wind blows  
There's nothing else you can run to  
Let's stay together tonight  
I'm waiting for you  
All the words that I told you  
Will always be true  
Let's stay together tonight  
Whatever we do  
  
Why must I keep pretending  
I'm in control  
When I can feel your senses  
Burning through my soul  
Through my soul  
  
I believe in you so  
And there's only one moment to live  
When you're here next to me  
There's so much more I have to give  
  
REPEAT CHORUS  
  
Hold me close, don't let me go  
I just want you to say that, I need you  
I want you to know  
  
REPEAT CHORUS  
  

Really thought that I could live without you  
Really thought that I could make it on my own  
Sent you away yeah I said I didn't need you  
I let you go I let you go I let you go  
Now I'm so lost without you  
Now you're not here and now I know  
  
Lonely is the night when I'm not with you  
Lonely is the night ain't no light shining through  
Till you're in my arms till you're here by my side  
Lonely am I  
  
Never thought that I that I would need you  
Never thought that I that I'd be missing you  
Gotta get you back  
I just got to find a way now  
To let you know to let you know to let you know  
That I'm so lost without you  
And now this world it just ain't right  
  
Lonely is the night when I'm not with you  
Lonely is the night ain't no light shining through  
Till you're in my arms till you're here by my side  
Lonely am I  
  
I can make it through the day  
I can fake it okay  
I just smile and pretend  
And I tell myself I'll be alright  
  
But lonely is the night  
Lonely is the night

Won't you think about it  
Do you know that it's easier said when it's done  
We're all in this together  
I'm not asking too much  
Just some time to stay for as long  
As you can  
It's already tomorrow  
  
Looking out for something outside  
I'm sure you can give me the answer  
Won't you say you'll give me some time  
That's all I can ask for an answer  
  
Everybody's leavin' won't you try  
To let me show you how  
Put some weight on your shoulders  
Everybody knew your eyes were searching  
Around the room  
Till I saw you  
  
Looking out for something outside  
I'm sure you can give me the answer  
Won't you say you'll give me some time  
That's all I can ask for an answer  
  
What am I to do  
What am I to do  
When she turns me down  
Just give up on you  
Can't stop all I need to the ground  
  

I realize the best part of love is the thinnest slice  
And it don't count for much  
But I'm not letting go  
I believe there's still much to believe in  
  
So lift your eyes if you feel you can  
Reach for a star and I'll show you a plan  
I figured it out  
What I needed was someone to show me  
  
You know you can't fool me  
I've been loving you too long  
It started so easy  
You want to carry on  
  
[Chorus:]  
Lost in love and I don't know much  
Was I thinking aloud and fell out of touch?  
But I'm back on my feet and eager to be what you wanted  
  
So lift your eyes if you feel you can  
Reach for a star and I'll show you a plan  
I figured it out  
What I needed was someone to show me  
  
You know you can't fool me  
I've been loving you too long  
It started so easy  
You want to carry on  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You know you can't fool me  
I've been loving you too long  
It started so easy  
You want to carry on  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now I'm lost, lost in love, lost in love, lost in love  
Now I'm lost, lost in love, lost in love, lost in love  
Lost in love, lost in love, lost in love  
Lost in love, lost in love, lost in love

As the time slips through your fingers  
Till it's almost time to go  
And the morning breaks between us  
And the ice melts into snow.  
I'm alright loving you  
I'm alright loving you  
  
Love and other bruises didn't have to choose us  
But it did and I'm alive and I'm trying to survive  
Love and other bruises makes us all good losers  
I can't help it talking loud it's because I'm on a cloud.  
Won't you please take me home  
Won't you please please take me home  
I'm so mixed up over you  
I don't want to be alone.  
I'm alright loving you  
I'm alright loving you

I don't need money and possessions  
I don't need things to weigh me down  
I don't need to be under suspicion  
For all the things that never come around  
All I need is you and your affection  
To be a part of everything you do  
To break through a lost communication  
To let me know that everything is true  
  
CHORUS  
Put love in your life, find it today and hold me tonight  
You know there will always be me  
There will always be you  
Put love in your life, open your heart it won't be denied  
The one you thought could not be  
Is waiting for you  
  
I don't need anxiety to hold me  
In the name of something to embrace  
I don't need society to scald me  
To pin me down and slap me in the face  
All I need is you and your affection  
To be the judge and jury in my life  
Searching for that moment of perfection  
To let me know we surely are alive  
  
CHORUS  
  
The puzzled look the years of doubt  
It all was meant to be  
We can't escape the dreams we make  
This feeling now just cannot wait  
So share it with me  
  

Once, did you want to belong  
To somewhere and someone  
And would it be never ending  
All, all that I thought I knew  
Has all come down to you  
And on your heart I'm depending  
  
Please, won't you come with me  
I want you to see  
  
Now, it's not hard to say  
Will you run away  
Or will you find what you wanted  
All, all that my senses take  
Each moment I'm awake  
You were all that I wanted  
  
Please, won't you come with me  
I want you to be  
  
Sanctuary, my sanctuary  
A silhouette that's made of flesh and bone  
A shade of love behind this wall of stone  
Sanctuary, my sanctuary  
Where anything but love is overthrown  
It's just a place where we can be alone  
  
Can you say, I heard you say  
That I'm the one who loves you  
This is where I long to stay  
I want to hold you now  
To remember how it feels  
When there's nothing in between  
So beautiful, so beautiful  
  
Sanctuary, my sanctuary  
A silhouette that's made of flesh and bone  
A shade of love behind this wall of stone  
Sanctuary, my sanctuary  
Where anything but love is overthrown  
It's just a place where we can be alone  
  
Sanctuary, our sanctuary...  
It's just a place, it's just a place...  
  
Sanctuary, our sanctuary... [ Fade ]

Sandy, the fireworkds are hailin' over little Eden tonight  
Forcin' a light into all those stoney faces left stranded  
On this warm July  
  
And the boys from the casino dance with shirts open  
Like Latin lovers on the shore  
Chasin' all them silly New York virgins by the score  
  
Sandy, the aurora is risin' behind us  
Those pier lights, our carnival life forever  
Oh love me tonight, for I may never see you again  
Hey Sandy girl, my, my, my baby.  
  
Sandy, the waitress I was seein' lost her desire for me  
I spoke with her last night, she said she won't set herself  
On fire for me, anymore  
Did you hear the cops finally busted Madame Marie  
For telling fortunes better than they do  
For me this boardwalk life is through  
You outta quit this scene, too  
  
Sandy, the aurora is risin' behind us  
Those pier lights, our carnival life forever  
Oh love me tonight, for I may never see you again  
Hey Sandy girl, my, my, my baby.  
  
Oh I mean it Sandy girl  
Oh, my, my, my baby,  
Oh I love you Sandy girl,  
My, my, my baby...  
  

She's the kind of girl, that you need to touch  
Follow through the fire  
She can take it all, always gives so much  
And laughs 'til she cries  
  
If she's far away I can feel her still  
Soothing my soul  
When she's here with me and I'm not myself  
She takes control  
  
She's got direction, she's got devotion  
She got the rhythm, such an emotional woman  
She's got the movement  
She's got the power  
In comes the sunlight when all the flowers unfold  
I know  
  
She's got the answer - she's got the answer  
She's got the answer  
She's got the answer  
  
I am here for you, you are near to me  
A mother or a child  
Generations passing through you  
Awake in the wild  
  
She's got direction, she's got devotion  
She got the rhythm, such an emotional woman  
She's got the movement, she's got the power  
In comes the sunlight, when all the flowers unfold  
I know  
  
She's got the answer - she's got the answer  
She's got the answer  
She's got the answer  
  
She's got direction, she's got devotion  
She got the rhythm, such an emotional woman  
She's got the movement, she's got the power  
In comes the sunlight, when all the flowers unfold  
She's got the answer - she's got the answer  
She's got the answer  
She's got the answer  
  

Silent night  
Holy night  
All is calm  
All is bright  
  
Round yon virgin  
Mother and child  
Holy infant so tender and mild  
  
Sleep in heavenly peace  
Sleep in heavenly peace  
  
Silent night  
Holy night  
Son of god  
Love's pure light  
  
Radiant beams from thy holy face  
With the dawn of redeeming grace  
Jesus lord at thy birth  
Jesus lord at thy birth  
  
Silent night  
Holy night  
Wondrous star  
Led by light  
With the angels  
Let us sing  
Hallelujah to our king  
  
Christ the savior is born  
Christ the savior is born

Another day has come and gone  
They fade away like winter sun  
I should have felt, what I I didn't see  
I should have known, that you needed me  
  
But now you're here  
My heart is young, my mind is clear  
The past was gone, when you came to me  
You were always a part of my destiny  
  
I always believed, that this day had to come  
There was not enough time  
And too much left undone  
I could never deny  
Just how far we had come  
  
I've got so much love  
So much love  
So much love  
So much love  
  
Another day to spend with you  
That's all I ask, just to be with you  
And how I feel, you just don't know  
And now you're here, I won't let you go  
  
I always believed, that this day had to come  
There was not enough time  
And too much left undone  
I could never deny  
Just how far we had come  
  
I've got so much love  
So much love  
So much love  
So much love

If I've got to run instead of feeling proud  
If I've got to find you in a big wide crowd  
No doubt the country side is waiting for me  
There ain't no answer to what I say.  
  
Now that I've found my soul I'm free  
Back to the highway that's calling me  
There must be reasons why I've got to hide  
There ain't no answer to what I say  
  
  
I'm standing alone my money's all gone  
So throw me a gun and teach me to run  
I'm standing alone my money's all gone  
So throw me a gun and teach me to run  
  
  
Here I stand I'm a wanted man  
Living in the shadows wherever I can  
There must be reasons why I've got to hide  
There ain't no answer to what I say.

TELL ME OF SPRING  
Come to me at Spring  
Every little thing  
Just makes me want you so  
I, I'm like the worn leaf  
Blowing to and from  
Until I find my home  
You appear, I'm alive,  
Forget my fears, forget all the reasons  
To hide my love inside.  
(REFRAIN 2 VOICES)  
You, you brought back my love,  
(What you do to me)  
You brought back my life  
(What you do to me)  
You brought back my everything  
(when you say to me how much I need ...)  
You, you brought back the light,  
(What you do to me)  
You took back the night  
(What you do to me)  
And gave me everything  
(when you say to me how much I need ...)  
I fall to the ground  
Send my prayer to the clouds  
There are no choices  
Hear the silence of sound  
Lay your head down  
And drink from the voices  
You appear I'm alive  
Forget my fears, forget all the reasons  
To hide my love inside.  
(REFRAIN 2 VOICES)  
You, you brought back my love,  
(What you do to me)  
You brought back my life  
(What you do to me)  
You brought back my everything  
(when you say to me how much I need ...)  
You, you brought back the light,  
(What you do to me)  
You took back the night  
(What you do to me)  
And gave me everything  
(when you say to me how much I need ...)  
(SHORT MUSICAL INTERLUDE)  
(REFRAIN 2 VOICES)(TWICE)  
You, you brought back my love,  
(What you do to me)  
You brought back my life  
(What you do to me)  
You brought back my everything  
(when you say to me how much I need ...)  
You, you brought back the light,  
(What you do to me)  
You took back the night  
(What you do to me)  
And gave me everything  
(when you say to me how much I need ...)  
(SHORT MUSICAL INTERLUDE)  
Come to me at Spring  
Every little thing  
Just makes me want you so  
  
  
  

I feel just like your love tonight  
So who's to say I'm wrong  
I've got to say I feel just right  
It's never been so strong  
  
There seems so many points to make  
But I feel this is a big mistake  
We're so old and this is new  
And I've really got to tell you  
I always said that we should remain free  
But that was up to you and not to me  
I started strong but I've met someone  
You know how long it's been  
  
That's how the whole thing started  
That's how the whole thing started  
  
Baby baby it's wrong  
But I've been in and out of love so long  
Here we stand not more than friends  
I broke your heart again  
I've gone and met someone  
  
That's how the whole thing started  
That's how the whole thing started  
That's how the whole thing started  
That's how the whole thing started  

(graham russell)  
  
Reach into your heart when you are near me  
The answer lies at hand  
Throw away all your fears of getting nowhere  
For all your moves are planned  
So don't spend too much time waiting by the door  
For you will never see right thru'  
Just walk right inside and I'll be there  
The answer lies there for you  
  
Come, oh won't you come, someone is calling and no one else will do  
Wake, from the dream in which you are falling  
The answer lies there for you  
So don't spend too much time waiting by the door  
For you will never see right thru'  
Just walk right inside and I am sure the answer lies there for you  
So don't spend too much time waiting by the door  
For you will never see right thru'  
Just walk right inside and I am sure  
The answer lies, the answer lies  
The answer lies, there for you

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire  
Jack Frost nipping at your nose  
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir  
And folks dressed up like Eskimos  
  
Everyone knows a turkey and some mistletoe  
Will help to make the season bright  
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow  
Will find it hard to sleep tonight  
  
They know that Santa's on his way  
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh  
And every mother's child is gonna spy  
To see if reindeer really know how to fly  
  
And so I'm offering this simple phrase  
To kids from one to 92  
Although it's been said many times many ways  
Merry Christmas to you  
  
And every mother's child is gonna spy  
To see if reindeer really know how to fly  
  
And so I'm offering this simple phrase  
To kids from one to 92  
Although it's been said many times many ways  
Merry Christmas to you

There's a man with the smallest of worlds in his hands  
And a tear fills his eyes as he tries to hold on  
Holding his world together  
  
There's a girl in the other half of the sky  
And she's wondering why her planet should sigh  
Don't you want me 'round forever  
  
The earth is too small to be divided  
Sunrise, moonfall, deep in the heart  
A part of everyone  
  
And we can't wait anymore, the time has come  
And those who need something more will feel the sun  
We're sharing one  
  
The earth is too small to be divided  
Sunrise, moonfall, deep in the heart  
A part of everyone  
  
And we can't wait anymore, the time is now  
You've got your foot in the door  
Get through somehow, break through somehow  
  
The earth is too small to be divided  
Sunrise, moonfall, deep in the heart  
A part of everyone  
  

When you look to the past for life's long hidden meaning  
For the dreams and the plans made in your youth  
Does the thrill to achieve match the warm hidden feeling  
That lies so still and lives in you  
  
In the eyes of a child there is joy, there is laughter  
There is hope, there is trust, a chance to shape the future  
For the lessons of life there is no better teacher  
Than the look in the eyes of a child  
  
You've found the place to walk the path you've chosen  
You'll never miss the world you left behind  
When life gives life, it's happiness unbroken  
When you give love, it's love you'll find  
  
In the eyes of a child there is joy, there is laughter  
There is hope, there is trust, a chance to shape the future  
For the lessons of life, there is no better teacher  
Than the look in the eyes of a child  
  
In the eyes of a child, there is joy, there is laughter  
There is hope, there is trust, a chance to shape the future  
For the lessons of life, there is no better teacher  
Than the look in the eyes of a child  
  
In the eyes of a child, there is joy, there is laughter  
There is hope, there is trust, a chance to shape the future  
For the lessons of life, there is no better teacher  
Than the look in the eyes of a child

Now the night has gone  
Now the night has gone away  
Doesn't seem that long  
We hardly had two words to say  
Hold me in your arms  
For just another day  
I promise this one will go slow  
Oh...  
We have the right you know  
We have the right you know  
  
Don't say the morning's come  
Don't say the morning's come so soon  
Must we end this way  
When so much here is hard to lose  
Love is everywhere  
I know it is  
Such moments as this  
Are too few  
Oh...  
It's all up to you  
It's all up to you  
  
[Chorus:]  
Here I am  
The one that you love  
Askin' for another day  
Understand the one that you love  
Loves you in so many ways  
  
Tell me we can stay  
Tell me we can stay oh please  
They are the words to say  
The only words I can believe  
Hold me in your arms  
For just another day  
I promise this one will go slow  
Oh...  
We have the right you know  
We have the right you know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The night has gone  
A part of yesterday  
I don't know what to say  
I don't know what to say  
  
[Chorus]

The whispers in the morning  
Of lovers sleeping tight  
Are rolling by like thunder now  
As I look in your eyes  
  
  
I hold on to your body  
And feel each move you make  
Your voice is warm and tender  
A love that I could not forsake  
  
  
Cause you are my lady  
And I am your man  
Whenever you reach for me  
I'll do all that I can  
  
  
Lost is how I'm feeling  
Lying in your arms  
When the world outside's too much to take  
That all ends when I'm with you  
  
  
Even though there may be times  
It seems I'm far away  
Never wonder where I am  
Cause I am always by your side  
  
  
Cause you are my lady  
And I am your man  
Whenever you reach for me  
I'll do all that I can  
  
  
We're heading for something  
Somewhere I've never been  
Sometimes I am frightened  
But I'm ready to learn  
Bout the power of love  
  
  
The sound of your heart beating  
Made it clear suddenly  
The feeling that I can't go on  
Is light years away  
  
  
Cause you are my lady  
And I am your man  
Whenever you reach for me  
I'll do all that I can  
  
  
We're heading for something  
Somewhere I've never been  
Sometimes I am frightened  
But I'm ready to learn  
Bout the power of love

The Scene  
(Graham Russell, Mark Towner Williams, Cliff Rehrig)  
It's another lovely day  
Are we still so far away  
And how can I share it with you  
It's not easy to believe  
Are we both about to leave  
Without ever saying, I do  
I still love you  
(Chorus)  
Just make me part of the scene  
Say we're together, always forever  
And everything else in between  
Just say we're part of the scene  
I don't want to hear it, I just couldn't bear it  
If things weren't as good as they seem  
You can say I'm not the one  
That a lot of faith has gone  
The bridges were never quite crossed  
Every grain of truth, we deny or prove  
Is somewhere before it gets lost  
And is found again  
(Repeat Chorus)  
What if these feelings are all in my head  
Flying around me in a world of their own  
What if there's nothing that needs to be said  
(Repeat Chorus)  
Just say we're part of the scene  
Say we're together, always forever  
And everything else in between  
Just say we're part of the scene  
Just say we're part of the scene  
Just say we're part of the scene  
  

Sun, I can't slow you down  
Run, build on sacred ground  
All of the leavesd have blown away  
Ghosts on a distant highway  
In a vanishing race  
  
Sleep, if your eyes must close  
Weep, over a poisoned rose  
Soon all the tears will blow away  
Dust on a distant highway  
In the vanishing race  
  
Fly, closer to the sun  
Fight, 'till your world is one  
Soon all the stars will burn away  
Ghosts on a different highway  
In the vanishing race  
  
Oh, shall we sleep tonight  
Take all your dreams and drive away  
Smoke on a distant highway  
From the vanishing race  
  
All my people  
Respect your Mother Earth  
Thank you for this life and this breath  
And all my people's strength

Sometimes when I just can't sleep  
And you're on my mind and I'm hurting deep  
At night, at night when the sun goes down  
And the lights turn on and you're not around.  
  
  
I've been this way before  
But it wasn't real  
But this time I'm sure  
It's the way I feel  
  
  
I dream when I call your name  
And I'm in a place that I can't explain  
  
  
And everything you see  
I can't conceal  
It's the way that it is  
It's the way I feel  
This time I'm sure  
It's the way I feel  
  
  
I've been this way before  
But it wasn't real  
This time I'm sure  
It's the way that I feel  
This time I'm sure  
It's the way I feel

In the night when you're lonely and you can't find a word for how you feel  
There's a place that you know of where the lights are so low they're hardly
real,  
In a chair on the front veranda is a weight with a thought to set you free.  
The weight is my soul  
  
The weight is my soul, come to me.  
I can see through the streetlights where the evening air is turning round  
All I hear is the hangin' of the moon and the stars on the sky.  
In a chair on the front veranda is a weight with a thought to set you free.  
  
The weight is my soul  
The weight is my soul, come to me.  
Have you thought of the times when your heart and your mind are free  
Have you thought of the times when your heart and your mind are free  
  
In the night when you're lonely and you can't find a word for how you feel,  
There's a place that you know of where the lights are so low they're hardly
real,  
In a chair on the front veranda is a weight with a thought to set you free  
The weight is my soul  
  
The weight is my soul, come to me.

(graham russell)  
  
I met you all alone yesterday  
You knew my life was beating fast  
The words I planned all walked away  
And left us holding what we have  
  
We shouldn't stay this long together  
I came to tell you and now I know  
The only chance of a love forever  
Went so many years ago  
  
  
I've told you there's nothing I can do  
I've told you I've got to get to you  
  
  
I'm not trying to bring you down  
I know you can bring me out my darkness  
I'm just trying to find your name  
I'm just trying to find your name.

Where are all the tricks that people play  
When they're afraid to say  
I want you to hold on to me  
If I let you go again tonight  
Whose arms will keep me warm  
And take me where I want to be  
But if I lose and then surrender all I know  
What would I do if you decided to let go  
Hopelessly I'd stand there with everything all gone  
My head down in my hands  
Just wondering why  
  
CHORUS  
This heart belongs to me  
And I know what I believe  
But now it longs to be  
Only with you  
  
Where are all the words I sometimes say  
When I'm afraid to ask  
I want you to hold on to me  
Anyway you want to let me know  
You're sharing my belief  
Of wanting to hold on to me  
I tell the truth and risk you running from my life  
So much to lose and yet  
You know how hard I try  
Hopelessly I'd stand there with everything all gone  
My head down in my hands  
Just wondering why  
  
CHORUS  
  
My love it goes only to one  
This heart belongs to me  
MY love it goes only to one  
This heart belongs to me  
My love  
My love  
This heart belongs to me  
My love, my love  
This heart belongs to me  
  

I was down my dreams were wearing thin  
When you're lost where do you begin  
My heart always seemed to drift from day to day  
Looking for the love that never came my way  
  
Then you smiled and I reached out to you  
I could tell you were lonely too  
One look and then it all began for you and me  
The moment that we touched I knew that there would be  
  
Two less lonely people in the world  
And it's gonna be fine  
Out of all the people in the world  
I just can't believe you're mine  
In my life where everything was wrong  
Something finally went right  
Now there's two less lonely people  
In the world tonight  
  
Just to think what I might have missed  
Looking back how did I exist  
I dreamed, still I never thought I'd come this far  
But miracles come true, I know 'cause here we are  
  
Two less lonely people in the world  
And it's gonna be fine  
Out of all the people in the world  
I just can't believe you're mine  
In my life where everything was wrong  
Something finally went right  
Now there's two less lonely people  
In the world tonight  
  
Tonight I fell in love with you  
And all the things I never knew  
Seemed to come to me somehow  
Baby, love is here and now there's  
  
Two less lonely people in the world  
And it's gonna be fine  
Out of all the people in the world  
I just can't believe you're mine  
In my life where everything was wrong  
Something finally went right  
Now there's two less lonely people  
In the world tonight  

Oh, my love, my darling, I've hungered for your touch a long, lonely time.  
And time goes by so slowly and time can do so much, are you still mine?  
I need your love, I need your love, God speed your love to me!  
  
Lonely rivers flow to the sea, to the sea, To the open arms of the sea.  
Lonely rivers sigh, "Wait for me, wait for me!" I'll be coming home, wait for  
me!  
  
Oh, my love, my darling, I've hungered, hungered for your (touch) a long,  
lonely time (?)  
Time goes by so slowly and time can do so much, are you still  
mine?  
I need your love, I need your love, God speed your love to me!

We are all alone that's the way it seems to be  
Love is in my sight and I can see it if you can  
Where do we come from, I've been waiting for so long  
We are all alone, say you will.  
The lights have all gone home and are safely tucked away  
There's nothing to come between us but the words we've got to say  
  
[Chorus]  
Where do we come from I've been waiting for so long  
We are all alone.  
And now we are both here are we really within reach  
Of the things we need to do see'est a ou see'est la vie  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And now we can both spend all the time that's come our way  
I'm not going to let you go for another single day  
  
[Chorus]

We are all children covered in mud  
Bound by the sacred and searching for love  
We are all children adrift on the sea  
Searching for someone, say come back to me  
  
We are all children covered in mud  
Jam on our faces, we want to be loved  
We are all children growing so fast  
Walking on water, hearts made of glass  
  
If I hold you as close as I can  
We belong to every woman and man  
Everyone who knows  
  
You, me, we are all children  
Us, them, we are all children  
We all are somebody's daughter and son  
  
We are all children covered in mud  
Trapped in the wilderness, stars up above  
Outside we all look shiny and clean  
Inside the voices, are ready to scream  
  
We are all children growing so fast  
Worshipping idols, stuck in the past  
We are all children covered in mud  
Jam on our faces, we want to be loved  
  

Love comes to everyone some are weak some strong  
I'm not strong today  
They've took her back, brought the curtain down  
What can I do now, I'm afraid to think about it.  
  
[Chorus]  
What a life, gets better as it goes along  
What a life, gets better as it goes along  
Been in love, been left standing till I said is that what I want,  
Oh no there's got to be another smile on my face  
I don't care about the money I make or what it can do  
I'm alive and that's what's important to me  
I don't need someone to tell me you'll get along, you'll get along  
Who to love who to watch over me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There's an old man been calling me for a long time  
I'm never able to get his face off my mind  
He always said to me take it easy take it easy  
And all the things you want will come easy, will come easy.  
What a life, what a life  
  
[Chorus]  
  
He always said to me take it easy take it easy  
And all the things you want will come easy, will come easy  
What a life, what a life,  
  
[Chorus]

As I walk this land of broken dreams  
I have visions of many things  
But happiness is just an illusion  
Filled with sadness and confusion  
  
What becomes of the brokenhearted?  
Who have loved, that's now departed  
I know I've got to find  
Some kind of peace of mind, baby  
  
The roots of love grow all around  
But for me they come a tumblin' down  
Every day heartaches grow a little stronger  
I can't stand this pain much longer  
  
I walk in shadow, searching for light  
Cold and alone, no comfort in sight  
Hoping and prayin' for someone to care  
Always movin' and goin' nowhere  
  
What becomes of the brokenhearted?  
Who have loved, that's now departed  
I know I've got to find  
Some kind of peace of mind, help me, please  
  
I'm searching though I don't succeed  
Someone's love, there's a growing need  
All is lost, there's no place for beginning  
All that's left is an unhappy ending  
  
Now, what becomes of the brokenhearted?  
Who have loved, that's now departed  
I know I've got to find  
Some kind of peace of mind  
I'll be searching everywhere  
Just to find someone to care  
  
Now, what becomes of the brokenhearted?  
Who have loved, that's now departed  
I know I've got to find  
Some kind of peace of mind  
  
Nothing's gonna stop me now  
I'll find a way somehow  
I'll be lookin' everywhere  
I know I'm gonna find a way

What kind of man is enough to begin to understand  
How love begins so small  
From that first day when she wakes and your arms are all she has  
To hold on to  
You'll never let her go and you say  
What kind of girl.  
  
You'll never run anymore now that the world has come alive  
For you, you'll say (how did I once survive)  
What kind of girl does it take that gives everything she has  
Always you know you'll never let her go  
And you'll say what kind of girl  
  
CHORUS  
What kind of girl  
What kind of girl  
What kind of girl  
What kind of girl  
  
From that first day when she wakes and your arms are all she has  
To hold on to  
You'll never let her go and you say  
What kind of girl  
  
CHORUS  

I just saw a picture, from the lost and found  
It was taken the day that we met  
With so many people around  
  
All my false bravado seemed to disappear  
So I just had to follow my heart  
I knew it would take me somewhere  
  
And I still feel the same  
But it's heart to explain  
All my emotions are tossed in the wind  
Lost 'til the moment, I hold you again  
  
When I say I love you  
When I say I need you  
When you say come closer  
I know I'll never leave you  
  
You can stare into heaven  
When your heart is free  
I suppose that we just couldn't wait  
For heaven is where we must be  
  
And we still feel the same  
No need to explain  
I don't see the shadows  
I don't feel the rain  
I'm walking in sunlight  
I'll tell you again  
  
When I say I want you  
When I say I need you  
When you say come closer  
I know I'll never leave you  
When I say I love you  
When you come closer  
I know I'll never leave you

When the time is right  
I will come back for you  
To hold you through the night  
Just like I always do  
  
Oh Jane, take me to your room again  
Why can't we learn how to love and let go  
One more time  
  
Oh Jane, hold me in your ams again  
Don't you feel the heat of the night deep inside,  
Oh Jane  
  
When the time is right  
And you reach out for me  
I'll run back to your side  
Just where I used to be, Oh Jane  
  
You can take the pain away  
Say we'll be together once more  
Please open the door, Oh Jane  
  
Oh Jane, hold me in your ams again  
Will we ever learn how to love  
Learn how to love and let go  
  
When the time is right  
I will come back for you  
With arms to hold you tight  
Just like I always do  
  
Oh Jane, take me to your room again  
Because I believe the heat of the night is still burning bright  
Deep inside  
  
Oh Jane, hold me in your ams again  
Tell me if you want me to go  
I'll leave you alone, Oh Jane.  
  
Oh Jane, take me to your room again  
Can't you feel the heat of the night is still burning bright  
Deep inside  
  
Oh Jane, hold me in your ams again  
Why can't we learn how to love,  
Learn how to love and let go.  
  

All alone  
Nothing to do  
It's lonely here  
Without you  
  
The candle light is burning low  
A love song's on the radio  
And memories are all I have to show  
  
Photographs  
Tickets for two  
Promises  
That all fell through  
  
Now everything's in black and white  
The colors faded with the night  
The stars we used to wish upon  
Have somehow lost their light  
  
Where is the feeling we used to know  
Where is the music that played  
Oh, what happened to the love  
That used to show  
Where did the feeling go  
  
A cigarette  
A glass of wine  
A paperback  
To pass the time  
  
As I lie awake tonight  
I'll leave the porch light burning bright  
And miss the loving arms  
That used to hold me tight  
  
Where is the feeling we used to know  
Where is the music that played  
Oh, what happened to the love  
That used to show  
Where did the feeling go

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas  
Just like the ones I used to know  
Where the tree tops glisten  
And children listen  
To hear sleigh bells in the snow  
  
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas  
With every Christmas card I write  
May your days be merry and bright  
And may all your Christmases be white  
  
Where the tree tops glisten  
And children listen  
To hear sleigh bells in the snow  
  
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas  
With every Christmas card I write  
May your days be merry and bright  
And may all your Christmases be white

WHO AM I  
Who am I to understand  
The ways of love a grain of sand  
To fall between these fingers  
That I hold  
Who am I that you should trust  
A wind that turns a stone to dust  
A mountain to surrender all its gold  
And who am I to say, you should believe in me  
And who am I to say I love you  
One reason why love cannot die  
Tell me who am I  
(DOUBLE VOICE)  
Who am I, I never knew  
My heart was roaming from or to  
(I don't know where we are going to)  
The different arms between my day and night  
(All I want is just to be with you)  
Who am I, a distant sun  
A thought before the moment's gone  
(Just a thought before the moment's gone)  
And I will never let you from my side  
(You will always be the only one)  
And all I have to say you can believe in me  
For who am I to say I love you  
One reason why love cannot die  
You are on my heart remembers  
Tell me who am I  
And who am I to say I love you  
One reason why love can not die  
Tell me who am I  
For who am I to say I love you  
One reason why love cannot die  
You are on my heart remembers  
Tell me who  
Tell me who am I  
  

Who will love me now  
Who will love me now  
Who will love me now  
Who will love me now  
  
Well I tried to give up  
Walking the streets when I was with you  
Snug as a bug in a rug  
Never been so alone thinking about you  
  
Who will love me now  
Who will love me now  
Who will love me now  
Who will love me now  
  
Trying on my own  
But living alone is one thing I can never do  
I could end it all now  
But I'm not that crazy  
  
Who will love me now, who will love me now  
Who will love me now, who will love me now  
  
Oh I need all the love  
that you once used to give me  
Words are never enough  
Now you can't be with me  
I need all the love  
But who will take my hand and show me how  
Who will love me now  
  
Being home by myself  
Believing so much you'd walk through the door  
And tell me you think I'm a fool  
But you won't do that now  
You've done it so often  
  
Who will love me now, who will love me now  
Who will love me now, who will love me now  
  
Trying on my own  
But living alone is one thing I can never do  
I could end it all now  
But I'm now that crazy  
  
Who will love me now, who will love me now  
Who will love me now, who will love me now  
  
Oh I need all the love  
that you once used to give me  
Words are never enough  
Now you can't be with me  
I need all the love  
But who will take my hand and show me how  
Who will love me now

Why, do we feel, do we hope, do we steal the years  
As long as we're together, for as long as we're together  
We will know.  
  
Why do we give, do we say, will you take my hand  
And live with me forever, if you live with me forever.  
We will know.  
  
Every day and night belongs to us.  
Every step we take will be.  
Just like the moment when this world was made for us,  
Made for you and you for me.  
  
Why are we strong are we weak, are we everything?  
And meant for each other.  
We were meant for each other, that I know.  
  
Every day and night belongs to us.  
Every step we take will be.  
Just like the moment when this world was made for us,  
Made for you and you for me.  
  
Every day and night belongs to us.  
Every step we take will be.  
Just like the moment when this world was made for us,  
Made for you and you for me.  
  
Why do we give?  
Why do we feel?  
Why do we live?

VERSE 1  
Don't you worry, pretty baby  
Everything's alright  
Its another day tomorrow  
And another night.  
You can tell me how your feeling  
Every single word  
I was having trouble sleeping  
Like the early bird  
Who just want's to be heard  
CHORUS  
Why don't you come over  
I can't stop thinking of you  
Why don't you come over  
My heart won't rest "till you do  
pick up the phone  
Your clothes from the floor  
The sleep in your eyes  
And walk through the door  
I'll turn on the light  
Why don't you come over  
Why don't you come over  
Why don't you come over tonight  
VERSE 2  
We can sit down at the table  
Let your problems drown  
I know how to get you smiling  
How to be your clown  
There's no need to think about it  
Just come as you are  
I'll be waiting by the window  
For my shining star  
You know it's not that far  
CHORUS  
Pick up the phone  
Your clothes from the floor  
The sleep in your eyes  
And walk through the door.  
I'll turn out the light  
Why don't you come over  
Why don't you come over  
Why don't you come over tonight.  
  

No I can't forget this evening,  
Or your face as you were leaving.  
But I guess that's just the way the story goes.  
You always smile but in you eyes your sorrow shows.  
Yes it shows.  
  
No I can't forget tomorrow,  
When I think of all my sorrow,  
When I had you there but then I let you go.  
And now it's only fair that I should let you know  
What you should know  
  
I can't live, if living is without you.  
I can't give, I can't give any more.  
Can't live, if living is without you.  
Can't give, I can't give any more.  
  
No I can't forget this evening,  
Or your face as you were leaving.  
But I guess that's just the way the story goes.  
You always smile but in you eyes your sorrow shows.  
Yes it shows.  
  
I can't live, if living is without you.  
I can't give, I can't give any more.  
Can't live, if living is without you.  
Can't give, I can't give any more.  
  
I can't live, if living is without you.  
I can't give, I can't give any more.  
Can't live, if living is without you.  
Can't give, I can't give any more.

Oh baby oh would I lie to you??  
Look into my eyes  
Can't you see they're open wide  
Would I lie to you??  
  
Chorus:  
Look into my eyes  
Can't you see they're open wide  
Would I lie to you baby??  
Would I lie to you??... Oh yeah  
Don't you know it's true  
Girl there's no-one else but you  
Would I lie to you baby??  
Would I lie to you??  
  
Everybody wants to know the truth  
In my arms is the only proof  
I've hidden my heart behind the bedroom door  
Now it's open I can't do no more  
I'm telling you baby...  
You will never find another girl in this heart of mine  
  
Chorus:  
Look into my eyes  
Can't you see they're open wide  
Would I lie to you baby??  
Would I lie to you??... Oh yeah  
Don't you know it's true  
Girl there's no-one else but you  
Would I lie to you baby??  
Would I lie to you??  
  
Everybody's got their history  
On every page - a mystery  
You can read my diary you're in every line  
Jealous mind never satisfied  
I'm telling you baby...  
You will never find another girl in this heart of mine  
  
Look into my eyes  
Can't you see they're open wide  
Would I lie to you baby??  
Would I lie to you??... Oh yeah  
Don't you know it's true  
Girl there's no-one else but you  
Would I lie to you baby??  
Would I lie to you??  
  
When you wanna see me night and day (would I lie??)  
If I tell you that I'm here to stay (would I lie to you??)  
Do you think I give my love away?? (would I lie??)  
That's not the kind of game I play  
I'm telling you baby...  
You will never find another girl in this heart of mine  
  
Chorus:  
Look into my eyes  
Can't you see they're open wide  
Would I lie to you baby??  
Would I lie to you??... Oh yeah  
Don't you know it's true  
Girl there's no-one else but you  
Would I lie to you baby??  
Would I lie to you??  
(X 2)  
  
Trust me baby  
Hey aint no-one else but you child  
Come on, Come on, Come on...  
Trust me baby  
I wouldn't lie to you baby

From this moment I will follow you  
To the borders of my country  
Will you make those promises come true  
Will you always want to hold me  
  
CHORUS  
Would you ever walk away from love  
Will your lips speak what is true  
If you say that this is where you belong  
That's all I want, from you  
  
In the garden of my deepest soul  
Is the seed to bring the future  
It's the story that is young and old  
And the student is the teacher  
  
REPEAT CHORUS  
  
Wind and rain can never change what is to be  
Lightning strikes across my heart so suddenly  
  
REPEAT CHORUS  
  

(Graham Russell)  
Here's on the street  
A tear in the seam  
Of pleasure and pain  
Life carries on  
A cloak of deceit  
Brings honour to shame  
But the voice I used to know  
(Where are you now?)  
Is the one I can't let go  
Chorus:  
You are the reason  
My faith in tomorrow  
A Distant horizon  
The one I must follow  
You are the first, You are the last  
I'help you to see  
The light in the dark  
The sun through the rain  
Until you are free  
And facing the truth  
That words can't explain  
But the truth I think you know(Tell me)  
I could never let you go  
Chorus  
you are the future from the past  
You are the spell that has been cast  
You are the reason  
My faith in tomorrow  
A distant horizon  
The one I must follow  
Chorus  
You are the first  
You are the last to me  
Oom hm.....You are to me...You are  
  

You belong to me  
From the moment I saw your face  
This is the one I can't replace  
I belong to you  
And every day is the perfect day  
And even more when I hear you say  
You belong to me  
Forever and always, just like the sky  
You belong to me  
I don't care what they say and I don't know why  
You belong to me  
Forever and always, you are the one  
And you belong to me  
  
We were meant to be  
And I know you feel the way I do  
I only want to be next to you  
Love came easily  
And all the feelings I just can't hide  
Makes us so close and so mystified  
  

Lately all my thoughts have gone to you  
You know that's true  
Sometimes I feel just a word away  
You'll say oh how I miss you too I do  
  
Time is tight I'm lost for words  
That's not like me  
Only your eyes could know the way that I feel  
And how much I need you now with me  
  
Young love so strong has never been a part of me  
Young love hold on we're feeling it now  
Is this the way it's meant to be  
  
I know I'll be the one to lose if I'm so wrong  
Don't be afraid to put your heart on the line  
I'll take you where I know you belong  
  
Take my thoughts away beyond the things we see  
Sometimes it seems just a word away  
You'll say oh how I really feel it should be  
  
Young love so strong has never been a part of me  
Young love hold on we're feeling it now  
Is this the way it's meant to be

I remember an evening so long  
How your innocence sang  
And the notes made me shiver inside  
Like your honesty can  
You asked me to please explain some things that seemed new  
What was it that felt like pain, and cuts in two  
  
CHORUS  
You're only in love, only in love  
Where life is new and dreams come true  
You're only in love, only in love  
To rise and fall and wait as we learn from it all  
  
When conscience pulls you away and your destiny calls  
Just follow your heart all the way, you'll never need more  
More than the burning light when evening must die  
You'll never forget this night, or wonder why  
  
CHORUS  
  
You thought that everything was just a lie  
Now, after so much time, don't let the secret pass you by
