You really in Beverly hills  
And so Drama beats.  
  
Damn rich, peanut butter guts and a Lamorghini, whoa  
You must have white brea, lets make a sandwich  
Now, I ain't never seen money you got  
Nobody got that kind of money in the Boondocks  
So if you take me up show me the Balcony look over  
The Hollywood valley I'll make your balloon pop  
Pop stars like you, you need a dude like me  
To appreciate your wealth  
I know you got an elevator in your house  
But with me you appreciate the steps  
Act like you don't wanna see how much it is Jack Daniels you can handle  
You can drink and get cut like Rambo  
Let me drive your Daddy's Lambo  
  
Take me up to Beverly Hills to your Daddy's mansion  
Let me see Hollywood for real  
Lights, camera, action  
I've seen you partying with keel, entertainment channel  
One thing I gotta know  
Can I drive your Daddy's Lambo?  
Lambo-o-oh  
Lambo-o-oh  
Your Daddy's Lambo?  
Lambo-o-oh  
Lambo-o-oh  
Can I drive your Daddy's Lambo?  
  
Your young and reckless, nice little diamond necklace  
Got a pint sized vodka drink and your pretty in pink  
Wanna go get breakfast  
Though you ain't never been to waffle house  
Always hanging in guys and dolls  
If you came to the shop, I'll put you in a Chevy AM  
Reach out to the mall  
Yeah I came to the club in a pair of Famous jeans and DTA hoody  
But I'm off to the party with rogue status looking for Beverly Hills goody's  
Yelawolf and I'm an Alabama boy  
Got more bounce than a salama boy  
Meet a rich girl I can't need a headache  
But I can take it if I can drive your Daddy's toy  
  
Take me up to Beverly Hills to your Daddy's mansion  
Let me see hollywood for real  
Lights, camera, action  
I've seen you partying with keel, entertainment channel  
One thing I gotta know  
Can I drive your Daddy's Lambo?  
Lambo-o-oh  
Lambo-o-oh  
Your Daddy's Lambo?  
Lambo-o-oh  
Lambo-o-oh  
Can I drive your Daddy's Lambo?  
  
What you got in that toe bag  
That one of a kind Prada  
That beautiful behind inspires me  
Makes one of my rhymes harder  
Your dadda made a fine daughter  
Make me wanna turn this wine from water  
Keep the party going in and keep an 808 bumping cause Drummer made a beat
that'll climb the chart  
Money, money, money, money, money ain't it funny what a hunny and a
Lambourghini will do  
Some will run into a hundred dollar bill and drill a dick anytime, unhappy
with a 24 inch shoes  
But come and explore this dude  
Analyse my swing  
It's slick rick and Bobby baby  
Gotta let me drop that thing, come on  
  
Take me up to Beverly Hills to your Daddy's mansion  
Let me see Hollywood for real  
Lights, camera, action  
I've seen you partying with keel, entertainment channel  
One thing I gotta know  
Can I drive your Daddy's Lambo?  
Lambo-o-oh  
Lambo-o-oh  
Your Daddy's Lambo?  
Lambo-o-oh  
Lambo-o-oh  
Can I drive your Daddy's Lambo?  
  
Just whip it around you know  
Up the hills  
I ain't gon' wreck it, I promise

This ain't for the good girls gone bad  
This one's for the bad girls tryna go good  
  
[Chorus]  
How can someone like me so bad just touch a good girl  
Touch a good girl, you're a good girl  
And I know that I don't treat you like I should girl  
Like I could girl, like my good girl  
  
Here I go again, on my shit again  
Walking through the mall, acting like a prick again  
You had a halter top, I had my Famous socks  
You came to shop, I came to ho hop  
You had your girl with you, both looking great  
I wanted both of y'all, how 'bout a double take  
She was hating, looking at me like a scumbag  
But something made you wanna turn around and come back  
Probably cause I just don't give a fuck  
I just wanna see one of these hookas in my truck  
So tell your girlfriend "tough luck"  
She just wanna see you with somebody dressed up well  
I really ain't into that type of shit  
I'm into tattoos, drink til six  
Fuck until nine, sleep until twelve  
And going back to my homies with a story to tell  
  
[Chorus]  
  
This shit should've been finished  
I'm as surprised as you are that you still let me in it  
But you continue to text message me  
Right after saying that we should move separately  
But you don't wanna see me go  
Even though I've only given you dick and cold cereal  
So you must have a thing for Lucky Charms  
Or the bad girl in you just fell in my lucky arms  
You love to cuss me out and call me crazy  
Say I'm no good and all of your friends hate me  
Then you show up to my room and damn near rape me  
And then it goes from "fuck you" to "fuck me baby"  
You leave early so nobody sees you out the spot  
Now you stuck between a hard place and a rock  
You call me a player but I have lied to you not  
Cause I'm not a player, I just crush a lot, holler  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm in jail again, on my Johnny Cash  
Some dude was talking shit, I had to whoop his ass  
Called you in the morning and you just fucking laughed  
You think this cute, you love my crazy ass  
And I wonder if you'll ever leave my side  
Cause the more that I ignore you, the more you wanna ride  
I tell you that I'm bad but you never ask why  
Cause you just want the good from a really bad guy  
You wanna rock, let's rock and roll, just know  
I'm only good at one thing and that's not control  
But I am consistent, that's something to be proud of  
Cause I ain't shit with you and I ain't shit without you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
To all the bad girls, trying to go good  
No such thing as a good girl gone bad  
Just a bunch of bad girls tryna go good  
Holler at me, mane  
Hello, my name is Yelawolf  
I'm a sex addict, it's a disease  
There's medication for it and everything  
I take pills

[Chorus]  
Yeah, I'm throwed off  
Ain't about the money I'ma blow it off  
I made my own lane, let's roll, let's roll  
Yeah, I'm going off  
Ain't got a whole lot but I'ma show it off  
Better recognize game, lets roll, lets roll  
  
Yeah, now let me welcome you to my small town  
Big trucks in the yard, big bucks on the wall, country folks all around  
How I was raised, eight oh eight drums quaking, they shake that box, eighty
eight  
Yeah and the dope boys hotter than hells gate, but I, still in the shade  
With a fold out chair, a thirty pack on the back of that tailgate  
A-L-A, B-A-M-A I'm off I might pee in the lake  
I might go to Talladega and see me a race  
And bring me case, yeah I'm bringing a case, I'm gettin' throwed off  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And I'm all the way throwed off  
Z-seventy one take the bow off  
Dipped in mossy oak, with a mullet Mohawk  
Yeah, with a bright orange hat, and a bag underneath that Chevy seat  
Yeah buddy, might go off, split you like a bowling ball  
Split you in my overalls  
Yeah home of the gumbo, got a couple folks that'd do it to you for hundo'  
And when them elephant feet rumble  
That Dixie cups gonna fall off the console  
You don't wanna have a convo' and not understand that 'Bama slanguage  
Like hollerin' ain't it, but I come to paint it, so it won't be throwed off?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm just a kid that rocks  
I'm just a boy with a dream  
That bet it all with the last bill that I had hid in my socks  
Used to keep a twenty two in a shoebox  
Now I bang Beretta  
She's 22 and I keep her in a tube top  
White trash and all, take us all the way to the top and then laugh it off  
Like how the fuck did I get a catalog with more hits than a fucking jackhammer
dog  
Cause I planned it all, Crimson tide standing tall  
Shit, I'm another lit cannon ball  
Fuck around and I'm going off and I'm getting throwed off  
  
[Chorus]

Man this fuckin' bitch  
Took off, fuckin' with some, college graduate  
Punk ass, Abercrombie wearin' motherfucker  
Left me broken hearted in the Chevy  
It's all good though, know why?  
I got me bitch  
  
Both of us was in the same class in oh two Antioch Nash-Ville,  
And I wanted you so bad  
That I forgot to mind my manners  
Everybody wanted them panties  
Every guy was hopin' to land it  
We would flirt around and touch hands  
Until we fucked around and took Xanex  
And that's when you began to drive me bananas  
I was in denial it's apparent  
You began to lie to your parents  
You should know that I can't live  
Without you holdin' my name  
Now my heart's in control of my brain  
And I can't hold it in the lanes  
  
Rollin' down 20 man  
With this Jack in my cup, feelin' down on my luck  
And I'm doin 120 man  
Maybe I'm givin' up, baby I'm givin up  
Baby what is happening?  
Don't you believe in us? Don't you believe in us?  
She said I know you gave me everything  
But love is not enough, love is not enough, love is not enough  
  
Used to fuck so much we missed school  
You was there when I needed you  
I was there when you needed me  
We were inseparable  
And I was broke with no fuckin' food  
You was tough enough to be cool  
Skate holes all in my shoes  
Dope boys had me confused  
I was in love with hip-hop  
You was in love with that to  
What made it come to a stop  
Had to have been the money issue, bitch  
And I really miss the rain  
I gave you all of my soul and I got left was a key chain  
  
Rollin down 20 man  
With this Jack in my cup, feelin' down on my luck  
And I'm doin 120 man  
Maybe I'm givin' up, baby I'm givin up  
Baby what is happening?  
Don't you believe in us? Don't you believe in us?  
She said I know you gave me everything  
But love is not enough, love is not enough, love is not enough  
  
Who the fuck are you fuckin' now  
Bet he's always takin' you out  
College educated and proud  
Me, well I'm just a drop out  
Can't really blame you for buggin'  
Ain't I the dirt on your rug and  
Just a place to wipe your shoes  
And give me all your thrown away lovin'  
Back to my buzzin' and druggin'  
Back to my gutter with nothin'  
Back to the rut all of a sudden  
cracks in the covenant trust in me  
You ain't gotta worry bout sharin' this success with Wayne  
Now it's just petty change  
But I still feel the pain  
  
Rollin' down 20 man  
With this Jack in my cup, feelin' down on my luck  
And I'm doin 120 man  
Maybe I'm givin' up, baby I'm givin up  
Baby what is happening?  
Don't you believe in us? Don't you believe in us?  
She said I know you gave me everything  
But love is not enough, love is not enough, love is not enough

Meth lab in the back and the crack smoke pills through the streets like an
early morning fog  
Momma's in the slaughter house with a hatchet helping daddy chop early morning
hog  
I'm catching Zs like an early morning saw when I woke up to the racket yawn
and pause  
What the fuck man I can never get sleep man, peeped out the window what's
wrong with y'all?  
Stood up in my Crimson Tide Alabama sweat pants and threw my pillow  
Looks like daddy caught the motherfucker that tried to sneak in and steal his
elbows  
They don't know that old man don't hold hands or throw hands naw he's rough
like a brilo  
Went to the Chevy and pulled out a machete and that gun is heavy and tall as
the midget willow  
  
Think he's playin'? You better listen what he's sayin punk  
Don't make me go pop the trunk, on you  
He got an old Mossberg in the mossy oak duffle bag layin' in the back of the
dunk boy  
Don't make me go pop the trunk, on you  
  
Think he's playin'? You better listen what he's sayin punk  
Don't make me go pop the trunk, on you  
He got an old Mossberg in the mossy oak duffle bag layin' in the back of the
dunk boy  
Don't make me go pop the trunk, on you  
  
11:30 and I'm pullin' up dirty smoking babbage out the back of my buddies
Monty Carlo  
Spittin' over some super hot beats with a super hot freak we call the parking
lot hoe  
You know we sippin on that old brown bottle, bass in the trunk make the whole
town wobble  
So when we ride around bitches follow, but tonight one of the bitches is
giving us problems  
Well one of them bitches be fuckin' one of my homeboys favorite bitches  
And has been on his hit list for a minute and I think he's ready to handle his
business  
He told me Yelawolf get this and he handed me the Cartier watch that was on
his wrist  
He said watch this shit and he jumped to the trunk and grabbed his biscuit,
biscuit!  
  
Think he's playin'? You better listen what he's sayin punk  
Don't make me go pop the trunk, on you  
He got an old Mossberg in the mossy oak duffle bag layin' in the back of the
dunk boy  
Don't make me go pop the trunk, on you  
  
Think he's playin'? You better listen what he's sayin punk  
Don't make me go pop the trunk, on you  
He got an old Mossberg in the mossy oak duffle bag layin' in the back of the
dunk boy  
Don't make me go pop the trunk, on you  
  
Two men stand, one's gotta go  
One falls down to the ground, one walks down to the road  
Momma better call the police  
Now he's screaming no  
Took a buckshot to the chest with a rock salt shell and he's moving slow  
All this blood has spilled, enough to give a penguin chills  
Hot enough to make a potato smoke at the tip of a hollowed steel  
In the valley of the hollowed field  
In the valley of the hollowed 'til  
This ain't a figment of my imagination buddy, this is where I live Bama!  
  
Think he's playin'? You better listen what he's sayin punk  
Don't make me go pop the trunk, on you  
He got an old Mossberg in the mossy oak duffle bag layin' in the back of the
dunk boy  
Don't make me go pop the trunk, on you  
  
Think he's playin'? You better listen what he's sayin punk  
Don't make me go pop the trunk, on you  
He got an old Mossberg in the mossy oak duffle bag layin' in the back of the
dunk boy  
Don't make me go pop the trunk, on you

[Chorus]  
I can't seem to get you off my mind  
Turn on the station, but I'm still facing you and  
Everbody seem to lost their mind  
It's hard to handle, so I, change the channel on the  
Radio, 'cause internet killed the radio star  
Radio, and YouTube, killed the video star  
Hit the radio  
We can make a, make a video  
Now I'm a star  
Hit the radio  
We can make a, make a video  
Now I'm a star  
  
Picture me rollin' Pac, it's funny how time has changed  
Everybody's a critic now, it's all a debate on the internet wave  
It used to be you and Biggie, Chili Pepper's "Give It Away"  
Now we got ten year-olds sitting back in a chair like "those were the days"  
And though it seems so amazing to me that the labels lost the touch  
And I'm in the AM, flipping through the A.M. like I lost my crutch, limpin'  
Cause I can't walk straight if I can't turn it up, sippin'  
I need some Gin and Juice, Snoop Dogg, I brought my cup  
What's up, ah ha, okay, shut up  
Cause I think we had enough of radios and lunch with the love bugs  
Well let me give you a big hug  
Bag of mushrooms, here, take some drugs  
And play some group home or something  
And shit goodie mobs sould food is bumpin' rewind  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You'll never hear Black Star cause the program director is mostly deaf  
And you'll never hear triple six cause we live in the midst of the Bible Belt  
But that's when the light is filled, so let it shine  
Let em' rhyme, let em' hustle, let em grind  
Nothing wrong with the truth sometimes  
Sometimes, the truth is dark but the darkness sparks the truest art  
And you didn't even know you a window till a tornado blew it apart  
If Eric Clapton could sing about cocaine, then there's no harm  
Then I can write about guns, I can rap about girls  
I can sing about money and cars  
Not that my money is large  
Let's talk about broke is a joke  
Let's talk about gettin' evicted, everything owned thrown out on the road  
And maybe that there goes gold  
Shit maybe it's platinum sold  
But they don't want to see the green leaves from pirates gold  
Oh no, hold up rewind  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Pick up the change, pick up the change  
Ride in a Chevy cause I'm sick of the Range  
Catfish Billy come pick up the name  
Come inside, if your sick of the rain  
Turn the radio off and don't complain  
It's all a replay, it's all the same  
Got one drag, on a runaway train  
On a one way street better pick your lane  
  
Yeah, but you could let me pick your brain  
And we could be that Rolling Stone  
Mix 'em up with Janis Joplin  
Let 'em harmonize like Bone  
Or we could just leave it alone  
Let it take on a life of it's own  
Or we could be that World Class Wreckin' Cru  
Tell 'em to turn the lights back on  
C'mon  
  
[Chorus]

I usually don't do this, but fuck it  
You know what? (you know what?)  
  
You're like the hardest thing I've ever seen  
And I'm from the gutter so believe me  
I've seen some hard things  
You come from where the black flower grows  
I wanted to cut you down and take you home  
Call me Axl Rose  
I could see you in a 1976 Camaro  
Me and you, sipping whiskey, getting drunker than Jack Sparrow  
Is Black Sabbath, how you get mellow huh  
Well put your feet on my Harley Davidson pedals  
And rock and roll girl  
  
[Chorus]  
Like a diamond cuts through a pearl  
This the hardest rap song in the world (hardest love song)  
You could get it in with your girl  
You're the hardest rap song in the world (hardest love song)  
  
You don't got to drive a Fleetwood Cadillac  
You just got to know some words to Fleetwood Mac  
Horror movies turn you on, pull the sheets back  
Fuck it, I role play, do it to you in a Jason mask  
You switch walkers like a switch blade  
You walk into the room and it's like these other bitches get hit with a
grenade  
With that said, let me pull the spandex pants off you with my teeth like Ozzy
did a bat head  
I rock and roll, baby let's go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You ain't concerned with new clothes or salaries  
You would rather run across the country like Mickey and Mallory  
Being the natural born killer that you are  
We'll hang out the window with a pistol and I drive the car  
Who would bother to bother the general with nothing but snack food  
Shooting everything that moves, dogs and cats too  
Reenact the hardest movie scenes, bloody shirts and holy jeans  
We the hardest you and me, rock and roll baby  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Click bang, it's black magic  
I could do better  
Yeah, hardest love song in the world

Everybody's asking me lately where I'm from  
They wanna know what I've been through and what dirt I've done  
But man if I told you what I've seen and been through then you probably run
off  
If your scared of the truth so instead in secret lined in chalk  
See I've been lost ever since I could walk  
Looking for my daddy and anyone of mamma's boyfriends who would talk  
Or listen to me when I spoke instead of looking at me like a joke  
Leaving me behind leaving me to cry when you treated my momma like a ho  
But I learned quick that my daddy wasn't ever gonna come around  
And I didn't give a shit 'cause me and my momma we held it down  
No new kicks first day of school I'm goodwill bound  
But when you come from the trench that's how you learn to walk around  
So I don't give a fuck if you ever lay eyes on top of my new shoes homey  
I just wanted you to know I didn't need a dollar from you I got 'em myself  
So if you find yourself in the middle of the floor with the bottle drinking
yourself lonely  
Then you can keep company with the picture of me in the magazine on the shelf
turn the page  
  
[Chorus]  
Daddy can you see me? I'm putting on a show  
In the magazines, hear me on the radio  
So what do you think huh?  
(Well I hope that your proud now, to watch it all go down)  
I'm sorry daddy you didn't get to watch me grow  
Now I'm always on the road no time to say hello  
Bye (and I hope that your proud now, to watch it all go down)  
  
Yeah mamma you look great, perfect  
Be safe on your first date, for certain  
If he brings you home too late, I'll hurt him  
Don't worry bout me I'm safe I'll close the curtains  
And I feel like I'm raising you but what do I know baby blue  
All I know is that I was made in you so I put all my faith in you  
Yeah I was only ten but I felt like a man and I had to let you go  
All I wanted was for us to be rich tear drops in my cereal bowl  
So I turned into an asshole young and dumb smoking weed  
Vandalizing, robbing houses, stealing cars, that was me  
But everything I did I had to see  
Feel the pain, had to grieve  
To become who I am and I'm proud of the man I came to be  
What I've learned cannot be taught  
What I've earned cannot be bought  
Justified deserve it all  
So don't be concerned it's not your fault  
I never counted sheep I count my blessings  
So if you see him now momma don't give him the cold shoulder just give him my
message just tell him  
  
[Chorus]

Aye boo get these motherfuckers and pass that jack  
  
[Chorus]  
I see you bitches talkin' loud, but you ain't sayin' shit  
Get the fuck from round' here, you don't rep my shit  
You ain't from my city, you don't know about this  
You want that drama, you ain't ready for it bitch!  
Now throw it up! (Yeah Ho) Throw it up!  
Throw It up! (Yeah Ho) You ain't ready for it bitch  
Throw It up! (Yeah Ho) Throw It up! Throw It up!  
You ain't ready for it bitch  
  
I already got, two cars in the yard that don't run  
So why would I wanna break shit down for you?  
Better me confuse with the punchlines and bars that I launch  
Here the king of archery come, with a cracker dick  
To fuck you in that pussy carpet you munch  
If I'm not hardly the one, you must be barely the one billionth  
Really you kiddin', bitch I'm the prodigal son  
And I'm stuntin' like my daddy, d-dr-d-drinkin' like my mama  
C-C-country like my uncles, stutterin' like a CD in a donk  
Bump, bump, bump, bump  
And I'm in a blue Chevy, runnin' over motherfuckers in first  
I ain't even shift gears yet, I ain't even here yet, I'm outta this Earth  
Right? (Yeah ho!) But I just hit the surface  
And I'm 'bout to walk into a bank with a shank and a black can of paint to
check the clerk  
(Where the keys?) Bitch you better take your purse! I got a brick of herb  
And I hit the syrup, and I'm feeling like I might just hit the curb  
So get the fuck outta my way buddy you don't wanna walk around the chicken
house  
With a heart of a puppy dog with Yelawolf and Eminem, shit,  
Sufferin' succotash, yeah suck a dick, bitch  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Bitch please you don't wanna step up to this Misses  
G-A-N-G-S-T-A will make a nigga hit his knees when  
I'm up in the buildin', preach it to my children  
I don't be takin' no shit from you haters  
You'll make me hurt one of your feelings  
(Ha ha ha), Nah nah ni nah nah  
Pick your face up off the floor, I got you feelin' sad now  
You be on that Hokey Wag, Hokey Wag is bullshit  
Run into this Gangsta, have your preacher at pull pit  
Bitch, I was born on the Mississippi River  
Take no shit from a bitch or a nigga  
So so crazy gotta fucked up temper  
Bi-pola', not Nicki I'm worser, I'll hurt ya  
Ha ha, I got a crazy ass mind game  
Ma nigga, I'm a lion, untamed  
Hunt ya ass down in my jungle, I do this  
I tell them hoes, "You ain't ready for it bitch!"  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I see you bitches talkin' loud, but you ain't sayin'  
  
Me and Yelawolf, tear the roof, off this motherfucker  
You ain't got the umph, you're a hoof, to the foot of an elephant  
Hello toots, you look so eloquent, that's what I tell a cunt  
Come sit up front cause you're kickin' my seat  
And I'm tryin' to the tell the cashier what I want!  
They say I act like an asshole, when I pull up at the White Castle  
And I ask for an appli-cation, throw it back in her face an'  
Tell the bitch I'm a rapper, then I wack her  
In the head with a Whopper that I bought from BK  
You expect me to be proper?  
Bitch you better pop in a CD of me immediately, slut, ho Skidda dee da da  
Prada? Not a chance, I was thinkin' about buyin' you some clothes  
But Target was closed so I decided to mosey on over to K-Mart, but the doors  
Was locked, what about some shoes I thought, great I suppose  
So I go to Payless but what'dya know, they didn't carry a size eight in hoes!  
Oh! This is ugly boy swag, puttin' toe tags on you motherfuckin' ho bags  
What a trailer trash pioneer, I am here, that's why I'm here  
I don't got a rhyme book it's more like a motherfuckin' diary of diarrhea!  
Me, Yelawolf and Gangsta Boo came here to show you a thing or two  
'Bout sign language, middle fingers aimed at you  
So we don't gotta scream at you!  
Ow! I just bit my bottom lip, it was an accident  
I went to go tell 'em all to go get bucked!  
But I'm never gonna bite my tongue, little bitch throw it up  
  
I see you bitches talkin' loud, but you ain't sayin'

Trunk Muzik, trunk Muzik  
  
Straight from the back of the game I rock it  
Yelawolf's got that crack boy  
In the woods with the S-K I'm cockin'  
You don't want to play with that toy  
Droppin' this heat like an asteroid  
Good in the south like Pastor Troy  
Pull up aside of a 1977  
Sittin' back and sippin' my Crown and seven  
Pimpin' I'm about to get down,  
Look at me changin' lanes  
Twin pipes lookin' like dragon's breath  
(Rooo) Chevrolet's blowin' flames  
Yes I, know it's strange  
Hit you in the left eye  
Hold the change  
Bitch you too heavy to carry  
You don't wanna bury yourself  
Underneath that eight O eight I'm droppin' in your face like  
  
To the DJ's  
Out cruisin'  
I got that Trunk Muzik  
Everybody hop in the Cadillac  
And outta back I'ma throttle the Chevrolet's  
With the bottom won't you roll the window down  
If ya cruisin'  
I got that Trunk Muzik  
Alabama's unanimous animal Yelawolf  
On the eight O eight come and fade away  
Ain't no better way to get down  
  
I told you I was coming  
Said I'd be here in five  
And even though I brought you glasses  
You still cant believe your eyes  
But if you don't believe it by now  
Fuck it just lean to the side  
Hold up wait a minute I don't really  
Wanna leave without a single solitary soul  
need em' for what I'll bring it to 'em  
If your sailin' catch my drift  
Lead me to the door check my list  
Meet me at the floor catch this fist  
Or meet me at the store catch this lick  
Build this house flip this brick  
Real skate borders feel this grip  
Moving through the alleyway  
Look at the people tripping  
Cause I'm on a chopper like  
  
To the DJ's  
Out cruisin'  
I got that Trunk Muzik  
Everybody hop in the Cadillac  
And outta back I'ma throttle the Chevrolet's  
With the bottom won't you roll the window down  
If ya cruisin'  
I got that Trunk Muzik  
Alabama's unanimous animal Yelawolf  
On the eight O eight come and fade away  
Ain't no better way to get down  
  
I have to be the hardest I got diamond nuts  
I piss excellence Ricky Bobby lines em up  
Catfish Billy half pints 'em up  
Yelawolf country fries 'em up  
Pull um in duffle bag then I roll 'em in a river then I hold up  
Watch what the fuck you hold up  
Dynamite sticks will blow up  
Ghet-O-Vision got this sewed up  
Roll up smoke up, everybody wishin' they choose us  
But we don't give a fuck you know what  
I know you didn't see me coming but I'm coming anyway  
Bitch Yelawolf is stylin' on 'em  
  
To the DJ's  
Out cruisin'  
I got that Trunk Muzik  
Everybody hop in the Cadillac  
And outta back I'ma throttle the Chevrolet's  
With the bottom won't you roll the window down  
If ya cruisin'  
I got that Trunk Muzik  
Alabama's unanimous animal Yelawolf  
On the eight O eight come and fade away  
Ain't no better way to get down

[Verse 1]  
Still on that ass like  
Handcuff's up in it like  
Hand-puppets makin' you holler  
You should've jumped in that impala homie  
Refrigerators never seen ice baby  
Not vanilla, not a reason that  
Yela make a flame grab a chinchilla  
Quite like the words I pulled up to  
Fuck guppies, I see food in a hush puppy  
So give me that king crap  
And I'll break a shell  
You seen that?  
Well fuck it, if he don't take it well  
So crack the top of that hot, shaking ale  
And say "free Young Struggle" who's not making bail  
He got popped by the feds  
Fuck the cops! Take a nail  
Fuck it take M-N-O-P, learn how to spell  
I'll pull up to the gate  
And we'll skate on this country, faggot  
And until then, fuck 'em, they can have it  
Slumerican means  
Slum American breed  
Gutter raised with worldwide dreams, yeah  
  
[Hook]  
Put your hands to the sky  
I'm a bullet in a barrel with a hair pin trigger now  
And I'mma landslide  
I'm a head case train wreck avalanche comin' down  
Put your hands to the sky  
I'm a ready made party  
I'm whiskey in a bottle now  
Lalalalalalalalalaa  
I'm whiskey in a bottle now  
  
[Verse 2]  
Still on that gas like  
The bottom of my signature shoe, 'Bama red  
I'm on that ass like Alabama did LSU  
You said "Oh lord" Bible Belt raised  
In your mouth like a cold sore  
Rolled Ford's? Nah roll tide and rode Chevy's  
My mama rolls joints  
Smoke rolls off with a timp  
Daddy's a rolling stone  
I'm rolling in shit with these pigs  
And the south side  
Who you rolling with in the sticks?  
With hair weawes and airstreams  
Cigarette stained walls  
Fuck, I can't barely breathe  
Spittin' shutgun pellets  
Out of my fuckin' chili bowl...  
But am I a hill billy, no!  
I am the truth behind these fuckin' illusionist  
Yellin' redneck, you about as red as the color blue is  
Call me a redneck, and I just tatoo it  
Because of the abusin' I use it as therapy in music  
So...  
  
[Hook]  
  
[Verse 3]  
Still on that grass like  
John Deers this yard is already cut  
You can't get no work here  
You fags started with swag, you was stealing  
It turns out I got no peers  
Just years of street smarts  
So here you go retards  
Come hit this bulls eye  
I'll give you three darts  
One, my last album flopped  
Two, it wasn't my time  
Three, my fuckin' mama's selling my pajamas online  
(Lalalalalalalalalaa)  
But guess what?  
(I'm whiskey in a bottle now)  
Fuckin' right, I'm aged  
I'm dirty-3, I'm not a child who plays with crack to get a piece  
Don't clap, for no MC who's wack  
Then get a free slap  
Fuck out my car when I smashed in a Caprice  
I'm Jack sippin' still  
Whippin' wood wheels  
Truck on steriods  
Illegal to play ball  
But damn it how good it feels  
Drop that black card  
Park in the backyard  
Baby fire up the grill  
It's party time  
  
[Hook]

With a full of trash straight to the ocean  
All black Benz is slowly rolling  
Head light's off don't be the chosen  
Thinks it's a game then drop the token  
Up shits creek without a paddle  
That's just life I'm in the saddle  
No rest no bitch we don't tattle  
Snake's don't always shake the rattle  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
All these cops they want the qouta  
Too much hypo coca cola  
Lucy smoke oh yeah you know her  
Shes that bitch who rest in nova  
Took that bite to bit the apple  
You know me I'm hard to tackle  
Break me down homie you wish  
You couldn't catch that fish with golden tackle  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
Give me give me till it's empty  
Too much money isn't plenty  
It's not enough it's not any  
Come come on just choose the jimmy  
They all want to bust a nut in  
Drop the bomb push the button  
Be the king, be the sultan  
Some of this shit is so insulting  
Break the broken make the chosen  
Choose the loose then roll the tie get down and soak with  
Gas the gap and light the match and leave you smoking  
Choking on the fuse the latest news, life's a wicked  
Life's a mystery and please don't be the witness  
To the sickness they'll just end it with it  
Something death and warm from the step of country fresh  
  
Yeah  
Yeah  
Country fresh  
Yeah  
Yeah  
Yeah  
Country fresh
