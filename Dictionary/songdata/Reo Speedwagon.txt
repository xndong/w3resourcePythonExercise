Diamond studded man  
Ruby coated plan  
Makes my heart ache to think that money could take you from me  
Midnight dream  
Almost made me scream  
Nightmares came now that money took you from me  
  
(Chorus)  
Well, you're a flash tan queen from the southern shores  
Like a rotten peach layin' in the Georgia sun  
Well, you can lay all day, get your back real brown  
But a dollar can take away your frown  
  
Fat rat queen  
Golden limousines  
All of these things just come between you and me, yeah  
  
Lacy white gown  
Just makes me want to frown  
My heart aches now that money's taken you from me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Shakes me apart  
Make believe hall  
I'm feelin' like a flower stuck on somebody's wall  
  
Midnight dream  
Lord it made me scream  
My heart aches now that money took you from me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, you're a flash tan queen

Night and day, day and night  
I do my best to do things right  
Never meant to ever hurt nobody  
And if I should in some small way  
Ever rain on your parade  
I will make it up to you I promise  
  
Ever since I met that girl  
There's no one else in the whole wide world  
Said she'd stay and be with me forever  
Mysteries have long been told  
About the girl with the heart of gold  
And you know I think that I have found her  
  
Chorus  
  
Because every time she looks my way  
I lose control, what can I say  
She's everything I've ever been after, oh,  
  
I found the girl with the heart of gold  
I found the girl with the heart of gold  
I found the girl with the heart of gold  
I found the girl with the heart of gold

Give me a ride on your roller coaster  
Give me a thrill, I can't help feelin' bored  
Give me a dime to call my baby closer  
'cause I'm alone, I'm feelin' bored  
I can't help thinking I'm ignored  
  
I've been away far too long to recall  
Just what it's like to be among my friends  
Give me a pill to ease my nervous tension  
'cause I can't hardly see the end  
I long to be among my friends  
  
I've been on the road for too long, I don't know  
I'm walking around and I don't know where to go.  
Well I'm half-crazed and I don't know who to be  
Won't you please! Help me please!  
Won't you please! I long to be at ease!  
  
Give me a ride on your magic carpet  
Take me away from this mediocrity  
What must I do to get me feeling better  
I guess it all boils down to me  
Responsibility's on me

I was with you, you were alone  
Now I'm standing here  
Wisdom came only after you'd gone  
Now I'm starting all over, with a tear in my eye  
I just never thought you'd disappear  
  
In the night your spirit arises  
With it comes the pain  
I hope I'm dreaming 'cause it hurts so bad  
When I reach out for you, I'm alone in some room  
I just never thought you'd disappear  
  
I still love you like a child  
Wasn't that good enough?  
I still want you, it drive me wild  
The pain is just too much  
Maybe I've lost enough  
  
Time heals all, so they say, I don't know  
Sometimes nothing's clear  
Maybe someday I'll understand  
But I know for a start  
There's a place in my hear that is yours  
And it won't disappear  
  
I still love you like a child  
Wasn't that good enough?  
I still want you, It drives me wild  
The pain is just too much  
I still love you

I gotta take a little time  
A little time to think things over  
I better read between the lines  
In case I need it when I'm older  
  
Now this mountain I must climb  
Feels like a world upon my shoulders  
I through the clouds I see love shine  
It keeps me warm as life grows colder  
  
In my life there's been heartache and pain  
I don't know if I can face it again  
Can't stop now, I've traveled so far  
To change this lonely life  
  
I wanna know what love is  
I want you to show me  
I wanna feel what love is  
I know you can show me  
  
I'm gonna take a little time  
A little time to look around me  
I've got nowhere left to hide  
It looks like love has finally found me  
  
In my life there's been heartache and pain  
I don't know if I can face it again  
I can't stop now, I've traveled so far  
To change this lonely life  
  
I wanna know what love is  
I want you to show me  
I wanna feel what love is  
I know you can show me  
  
I wanna know what love is  
I want you to show me  
And I wanna feel, I want to feel what love is  
And I know, I know you can show me  
  
Lets talk about love  
I wanna know what love is, the love that you feel inside  
I want you to show me, and I'm feeling so much love  
I wanna feel what love is, no, you just cannot hide  
I know you can show me, yeah  
  
I wanna know what love is, lets talk about love  
I want you to show me, I wanna feel it too  
I wanna feel what love is, I want to feel it too  
And I know and I know, I know you can show me  
Show me love is real, yeah  
I wanna know what love is...

Late one night on a road in Texas  
I pulled into an all-night cafe  
What's my pleasure? Well ma'am the fact is, I don't know  
  
Sat down next to a "Rajun' Cajun"  
A black haired beauty from New Orleans  
Did my duty can I buy you a drink dear  
She said "Please"  
  
(So) we rolled right along,  
And the night got long  
So I said how would you like it to be?  
  
Then she sang her song  
Said "If I come along  
You must find a place in your heart for me"  
  
I was lost on a road to nowhere  
And asked if she was goin' my way  
She was late for a date with no one  
(So) please don't leave  
  
She'd just left a love that was dying  
And had no plans of goin back  
I caught her eyes as she was crying  
"Let's make tracks"  
  
She said, "I'll follow , I'll follow you on your dare  
Your eyes say something, your heart better care  
You're lost and you're lonely, I've been to long there  
So I'll follow, I'll follow you...anywhere

There was a time some time ago  
When every sunrise meant a sunny day, oh a sunny day  
But now when the morning light shines in  
It only disturbs the dreamland where I lay, oh where I lay  
I used to thank the lord when I'd wake  
For life and love and the golden sky above me  
But now I pray the stars will go on shinin'  
You see in my dreams you love me  
  
Daybreak is a joyful time  
Just listen to the songbird harmonies, oh the harmonies  
But, I wish the dawn would never come  
I wish there was silence in the trees, oh the trees  
If only I could stay asleep  
At least I could pretend you're thinkin' of me  
'Cause nighttime is the one time I am happy  
You see in my dreams  
  
We climb and climb and at the top we fly  
Let the world go on below us  
We are lost in time  
And I don't know really what it means  
All I know is that you love me  
In my dreams  
  
I keep hopin' one day I'll awaken  
And somehow she'll be lying by my side  
And as I wonder if the dawn is really breakin'  
She touches me and suddenly I'm alive  
  
And, we climb and climb and at the top we fly  
Let the world go on below us  
We are lost in time  
And I don't know really what it means  
All I know is that you love me  
In my dreams  
  
And we climb and climb and at the top we fly  
Let the world go on below us  
We are lost in time  
And I don't know really what it means  
All I know is that you love me  
In my dreams, oh oh oh oh  
In my dreams

In your letter ooh in your letter  
In your letter ooh in your letter  
In your letter ooh in your letter  
In your letter ooh in your letter  
  
In your letter you said you didn't love me  
You said you're gonna leave me  
But you could've said it better  
Oh in your letter, you said you couldn't face me  
You said you could replace me  
But you could've said it better  
  
You could've left him only  
For an evening let him be lonely  
But you hid behind your poison pen and his pride  
You could've told him something  
And proved to me you don't love him  
But you hid behind your future full of lies  
  
You could've left him only  
For an evening let him be lonely  
But you hid behind your poison pen and his pride  
You could've told him something  
And proved to me you don't love him  
But you hid behind your future full of lies  
  
In your letter you said you didn't love me  
You said you're gonna leave me  
But you could've said it better  
Oh in your letter, you said you couldn't face me  
You said you could replace me  
But you could've said it better

Lookin' for a love  
Searchin' everywhere  
I can't get enough and I don't really care  
If it takes a lot of waitin'  
'Cause I've got the time to spare  
It's gonna take a lot more lovin'  
But we got plenty of that around here.  
  
Laughin' heading home a woman could be fine  
Flying back alone, I don't really mind  
'Cause it gives me the time for thinking  
How so many people just ruin their lives  
Folks miss out on so much lovin'  
By picking it up before it arrives.  
  
I can't see it but I know when it's there  
I can just feel it, it's everywhere  
I can't see it but I know when it's there  
I can just feel it, it's everywhere.  
  
Lookin' for a love  
Searchin' everywhere  
I can't get enough and I don't really care  
If it takes a lot of waitin'  
'Cause I've got the time to spare  
It's gonna take a lot more lovin'  
But we got plenty of that around here.  
  
I can't see it but I know when it's there  
I can just feel it, it's everywhere  
I can't see it but I know when it's there  
I can just feel it, it's everywhere.

This is just for you  
I dedicate everything I do  
My fear is gone  
And I feel so strong  
Love has never been so true  
I've never seen what I see in you  
I watch you sleep  
Your beauty runs so deep  
And wherever you go, I'll walk beside you  
And whatever you need, I will provide you  
Take my soul, and never let go  
  
Cause I live just for you  
And I give just for you  
And your love has me wanting to  
Be the best man I can be  
I believe in forever  
Just for you and me  
  
This is just for us  
To a future filled with truth and trust  
And your sweet touch  
I want you so much  
And there is nothing that we can't do together  
I am gonna be lovin' you forever  
Take my hand, and make me your man  
  
Cause I live just for you  
And I give just for you  
And your love has me wanting to  
Be the best man I can be  
I believe in forever  
Just for you and me  
  
Take my soul, and never let go  
Cause I live just for you  
And I give just for you  
And your love has me wanting to  
Be the best man I can be  
And I believe in forever  
Just for you and me  
  
And I believe in forever  
Just for you and me

You should have seen by the look in my eyes, baby  
There was somethin' missin'  
You should have known by the tone of my voice, maybe  
But you didn't listen  
You played dead, but you never bled  
Instead you laid still in the grass all coiled up and hissin'  
  
And though I know all about those men  
Still I don't remember  
'Cause it was us, baby  
Way before them, and we're still together  
And I meant, every word I said  
When I said that I loved you I meant that I loved you forever  
  
And I'm gonna keep on lovin' you  
'Cause it's the only thing I want to do  
I don't want to sleep, I just want to keep on lovin' you  
Baby, I'm gonna keep on lovin' you  
'Cause it's the only thing I want to do  
I don't want to sleep  
I just want to keep on lovin' you

I used to be lonely till I learned about livin alone  
I found other things to keep my mind on  
And I'm gettin to know myself a little bit better  
Whoa , I keep pushin on  
Keep pushin on, yeah  
  
Goin through all the changes I made so many mistakes, oh yes I did  
Tryin to leave behind the heartaches  
And sometimes I think I was a little bit crazy, oh yeah  
Whoa, I keep pushin on  
  
Keep pushin, keep pushin, keep pushin, keep pushin on  
Keep pushin, keep pushin, you know you have got to be so strong  
Keep pushin, keep pushin, well even if you think your strength is gone  
Keep pushin on  
  
Well it's comin together I finally feel like a man, oh yes I do  
I never thought that I'd be where I am, oh  
Everyday I wake a little bit higher  
Whoa I keep pushin on, oh yeah

Keep the fire burnin'  
Let it keep us warm  
The world will keep on turnin'  
Let it turn you on  
  
And let us not stop learnin'  
We can help one another be strong  
Let us never lose our yearnin'  
To keep the fire burnin' all night long  
  
You've been changing so much  
I'm not sure your in touch with what's real  
You just come and you go  
Never letting me know, how you feel  
  
And I'm livin' here in doubt  
There's so much to talk about  
I know that we can work it out  
  
We can keep the fire burnin'  
Let it keep us warm  
The world will keep on turnin'  
Let it turn you on  
  
And let us not stop learnin'  
We can help one another be strong  
Let us never lose our yearnin'  
To keep the fire burnin' all night long  
  
We've been through this enough  
It gets rough but there's nowhere to run  
This is where we belong  
We are strong, we can never give up  
  
If we wanted to we could  
But we've always understood  
To keep lookin' for the good  
  
Keep the fire burnin'  
Let it keep us warm  
The world will keep on turnin'  
Let it turn you on  
  
And let us not stop learnin'  
We can help one another be strong  
Let us never lose our yearnin'  
To keep the fire burnin'  
  
Keep the fire burnin'  
Let it keep us warm  
The world will keep on turnin'  
Let it turn you on  
  
And let us not stop learnin'  
We can help one another be strong  
Let us never lose our yearnin'  
To keep the fire burnin' all night long  
  
Keep the fire burnin'  
Keep the fire burnin'  
Keep the fire burnin'

I've played your game  
And I've played it well.  
I'll be another fool  
To hang upon your wall.  
I laid my heart out  
Like an open book.  
It's a simple thing and don't take much  
To crack it open and bleed.  
  
Lay me down.  
Lay me down when you're through with me.  
Lay me down.  
Let me bleed when you're through with me.  
Don't let me think you're wrong,  
Just let me fall down.  
I'll pick myself up again.  
It's the kindest thing you can do for me,  
So, woman, won't you lay me down.  
  
I lied to myself.  
Tried to believe in you.  
But it's hard to rely on the ghost of someone you hardly even knew  
You bring things out  
Just to bring me down.  
Then you twist them about and shove 'em in my face  
Til my eyes can't see any good.  
Yeah!

Suddenly it happened,  
Here we are with all this glory  
We never thought for a minute,  
That we were writin a story  
We took our chances,  
Somehow we held it together  
And now I feel there is justice,  
I always new there was  
  
I love the warmth of the spotlight  
I need the sound of the people screamin'  
Here we are to bring down the ceiling  
Want to give you a real good feelin'  
Later on when it's over  
We will think of you and remember  
You're the ones who gave us the glory  
Just want to tell you that  
  
[Chorus]  
It's great to, to be with you  
Been a long time but we love you  
Don't stop, let's be-bop tonight  
  
Do you remember the last time?  
We remember the last time  
Everything was cool,  
We had a celebration, yeah  
We had a celebration,  
Let's bring the feeling back again  
Come on closer,  
Just got to tell ya that

Cool as the water melting from the winter snows  
You are the island I've been looking for  
I don't know where you come from  
But I can feel you comin' on  
You're a storm inside my soul  
That's ragin' out of control  
  
[Chorus]  
Call the wind out  
Call out the thunder  
Oh lightning, only you can will the weather  
I said come on  
Won't ya come on?  
Lightning you're mine  
  
Tonight, tonight  
You caught me while I was sleepin'  
Restin' from a heavy run  
I saw you in your evening gown  
You were lighting up the sky  
No matter what tomorrow brings  
Lightning, your mine tonight  
Woah, lightning your mine tonight  
  
Crack the horizon  
Only you can split the night  
Then comes your mother cloud to take you away  
Another wind will dry me  
And the sun will make me warm  
But to me my life will always be  
The calm before the storm  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]

Well I've seen women who cross their legs  
Before they sit down to the table  
And I've seen women who look to the sky  
Screamin' Lord I believe in the Bible  
And I've seen hookers dancin' through Times Square  
With their heads held up so high  
But I've never seen a woman  
Who makes me feel  
Woah, like you do  
  
Well I've seen couples holdin' hands  
With that glazy look in their eyes  
And I've seen lovers rollin' round in bed  
Screamin' as if they're gonna die  
And I've seen lovers holdin' hands  
And then laughin' when their back is turned  
But I've never seen a woman  
Who makes me feel  
Woah, like you do  
  
Well I've seen women who cross their legs  
Before they sit down to the table  
And I've seen women who look to the sky  
Screamin' Lord I Believe in the Bible  
And I've seen hookers dancin' through Times Square  
With their heads held up so high  
But I've never seen a woman  
Who makes me feel  
No I've never seen a woman  
Who can make me feel  
Like you do

I got lumps in my throat  
When I saw her comin' down the aisle  
I got the wiggles in my knees  
When she looked at me and sweetly smiled  
Well there she is again  
Standin' over by the record machine  
Well she looks like a model  
On the cover of a magazine  
But she's too cute  
To be a minute over seventeen  
  
Meanwhile I was thinkin'  
  
Well if she's in the mood  
No need to break it  
I got the chance and I oughta take it  
If she can dance we can make it  
C'mon queenie let's shake it  
  
I said go, go, go, little queenie  
I said go, go, go, little queenie  
I said go, go, go, little queenie  
  
Won't someone tell me  
Who's the queen standin' over by the record machine  
Well she looks like a model  
On the cover of a magazine  
But she's too cute  
To be a minute over seventeen  
  
I said go, go, go, little queenie  
I said go, go, go, little queenie  
I said go, go, go, little queenie  
  
Meanwhile, I was still thinkin', hmmmm,  
Well if it's a slow one  
We'll omit it  
If it's a rocker, then we'll get it  
If it's a good one, she'll admit it  
C'mon queenie, let's get with it  
  
[Repeat x6]  
I said go, go, go, little queenie

Live it up, and let it go  
Your time is up before you know  
In a world full of wonder  
Don't let your troubles pull you under  
  
You're telling me your life is tough  
And what you need is stronger stuff  
Well you can live under sedation  
Or get up and cause an overnight sensation  
  
Whoa, live it up  
Life is what you make it  
Whoa, live it up  
It's right there for you to take it  
  
You sit and watch your MTV  
You dream away in a fantasy  
If you don't dig the situation  
Then get a guitar and rock the nation  
  
You can't hold back once you light the fuse  
And if it feels alright, then let it roll  
You got nothin' to lose  
  
Whoa, live it up  
Life is what you make it  
Whoa, live it up  
It's right there for you to take it

I know she's sleeping with him  
But it can't be true  
She loves me too much  
That's just something she wouldn't do  
  
Now you may say I look the other way  
You may think I'm blind  
But I say don't go looking for what you don't want to find  
  
Wouldn't I be the one that you'd come running to  
Wouldn't they be my arms  
I look into your eyes as you tenderly hold me  
So safe and secure, oh how I wish I were  
  
I know she's sleeping with him  
But it can't be true  
  
I say to myself, I've given all I can  
I tell myself this game must end  
But in the mirror do I see a new man  
Or will I look the other way again?  
  
I know she's sleeping with him  
But it can't be true  
  
I know it, you know it, everybody knows it  
I can't look the other way  
I won't look the other way again

Love is a positive vibration  
With love you find the good in a bad situation  
Everybody's gonna need a helping hand  
It don't really matter where you stand  
You're gonna need someone to lean on  
  
Hate is a constant inflammation  
A fire that's built on fear and frustration  
One man's heaven is another man's hell  
Every story has got two sides to tell  
Don't let anybody pull you under  
  
Some people just love to hate  
They criticize when they can't relate  
Some people don't love, they just love to hate  
  
Some people can hardly wait  
To tear down what you create  
Cause some people don't love, they just love to hate  
  
Somebody attacks without a reason  
He's just trying to drag you down in the hole that he's in  
Why are people so negative  
I think that everybody ought to just live and let live  
We could use a little understanding  
  
Chorus  
  
I guess some people been pushed around  
Now they're trying to even it up by putting somebody else down  
I believe that things can only get better  
When everybody learns to live together

"Lucky" I call you 'cus that's the way you make me feel.  
Love in the air and the wind in my hair is makin' me real.  
Look out Lucky there's a mountain in front of you.  
And with a little luck we'll see it thru.  
What's lucky for me is lucky for you.  
  
I used to think that luck was just another four letter word.  
But now that I found you it's the finest one I've ever heard.  
Do you see the stars now do you Lucky?  
They're not all that far, now are they Lucky?  
What's lucky for you, is lucky for me,  
And what's lucky for me, is lucky for you.

Lately we're acting like two kids in school,  
Spelling out things so he wont know we're through.  
We know it's over and we don't want to say,  
But letter by letter, he showed me today.  
And he really turned my head,  
As he turned around, with a tear in his eye, and said:  
Hey d-a-d-d-y,  
I saw m-a-m-a cry.  
Say your not going away.  
Is it because of me,  
Have I been b-a-d.  
Please, daddy, please won't you stay.  
Cause if you leave,  
What will you do with m-e.  
  
So I picked him up, sat him down on my knee,  
I thought I'd explain but, again, he showed me.  
We've been too busy avoiding the blame,  
We forgot the real heart who will lose in this game.  
And I still love you, I just did'nt see,  
'Til he opened my eye's, and he spelled it out to me.  
  
Hey d-a-d-d-y,  
I saw m-a-m-a cry.  
Say your not going away.  
Is it because of me,  
Have I been b-a-d.  
Please, daddy, please won't you stay.  
Cause if you leave,  
What will you do with m-e.  
  
Instrumental Break.  
  
Hey d-a-d-d-y,  
I saw m-a-m-a cry.  
Say your not going away.  
Is it because of me,  
Have I been b-a-d.  
Please, daddy, please won't you stay.  
Cause if you leave,  
What will you do with m-e.  
  
Oh, daddy if you leave, what will you do  
With me?

I remember it well, that day last spring,  
When the snow lay deep on the mountain trails.  
It was winter's last showin' and our last fling  
Before returning to our lives in the valley.  
  
We pretended we were lost in the wilderness,  
And I pretended to be your guide.  
Our love was a play and you were the actress.  
We were two lonely people living out a dream.  
  
Oh, baby meet me on the mountain  
When the winter is dying  
And the snow lay deep on the mountain trails.  
Maybe it's the spring putting thoughts in our heads.  
But baby meet me on the mountain  
When the winter lays her head to rest.  
  
As the morning came, the feelings faded.  
They melted away with the dew.  
And if it hurt, I never felt it,  
'Cause I knew that you'd be leavin' me soon.  
  
Come on, baby meet me on the mountain  
When the winter is dying  
And the snow lay deep on the mountain trails.  
Maybe it's the spring putting thoughts in our heads.  
But baby meet me on the mountain  
When the winter lays her head to rest.

I was sittin' with the sun, meltin' into the horizon  
High in the hills, up above Topanga canyon  
And I've never been to any other place that made me feel more like movin'  
Made me feel like movin'.  
  
Stopped into a shop where I met a young lady  
She thought I ought to move, she said livin' here could save me  
Oh and I've never been with any other girl who made me feel more like movin'  
She made me feel just like movin'.  
  
But I used to wonder why people got so excited  
About movin' to California  
I've only been here a week but I've been enlightened  
To a whole new way of life  
And it makes me feel just like movin'.  
  
I was sittin' with the sun, meltin' into the horizon  
High in the hills, up above Topanga canyon  
And I've never been to any other place that made me feel more like movin'  
Made me feel like movin'.  
  
But I used to wonder why people got so excited  
About movin' to California  
I've only been here a week but I've been enlightened  
To a whole new way of life  
And it makes me feel just like movin'.

Maybe we don't need to share the same roof, maybe  
If you really love me, you don't need me 'round for proof, baby  
If I go to the desert for some clean dry air  
We could have ourselves a long distance love affair  
We'll take it anywhere, a nationwide pair  
Well If your living together isn't working out  
I'd rather live in Nebraska, than keep livin' here in doubt  
I'll take an alternate route, I'll find a new way  
There are places to go that we've never dreamed of  
We're gonna find a new way to love  
  
[Chorus]  
We're gonna find a new way to love, find out what satisfies us  
The good old ways just ain't good enough  
We're gonna find a new way to love  
  
Maybe we could learn to like the same things, maybe  
Discover the joy that togetherness brings, baby  
We could share our records, we could see the same plays  
Even plan our vacations for the very same days  
We'll put our lives in phase, livin' in a happiness haze  
Well it may not be easy, but then nothin' else was  
Ask a mountain climber why he does what he does  
He'll tell you just because, I need to find a new way  
Hey now we've got a mountain of our own to rise above  
We're gonna find a new way to love  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Maybe we don't need to see eye to eye, maybe  
We don't need to vote for the very same guy, baby  
You can move to the left whenever I keep right  
I'm a big bad wolf, you can be Snow White  
I've got a huge appetite, you want to eat light  
I'm down here beggin' for more, you tell me you've had enough  
We gotta find a new way to love  
  
[Chorus: x4]  
  
We're gonna find a new way to love

My whole life rides on the mood of my lady  
Her ups and downs are turning my life around  
She's happy today, it's like a breath of new life  
But tomorrow her sorrow will tear me down.  
  
Slowly, oh slowly I can tell that she needs me  
It shows right through the walls she's built around herself  
Oh higher, oh higher I'm climbing in her eyes  
It's a servant she wants but a man she must have.  
  
Oh, oh woman I need you like I never needed anyone  
Oh, oh woman like the morning needs the sun  
Oh, oh woman you know that our lives have just begun  
I'll behave, oh woman, 'cause I'm your slave.  
  
Oh, two lives in tune, it's a delicate balance to keep  
We'll stand together but never too near  
Oh, hold me close but don't you smother me  
I'll speak of my love but only for you to hear.  
  
Oh, oh woman I need you like I never needed anyone  
Oh, oh woman like the morning needs the sun  
Oh, oh woman you know that our lives have just begun  
I'll behave, oh woman, 'cause I'm your slave.

Talkin' 'bout a hot-wired kid who thought he knew it all  
And what he didn't know, he didn't need to  
Changin' women like tires when their use wore thin  
Retread feelings, that's all we knew  
He's been runnin' lights for years, grindin' down those forward gears  
He's got a lady in the back seat, lady in the front seat  
Eyes on the road and whispers in both ears  
  
[Chorus]  
One too many girlfriends, and too little feeling left  
He better find the one, he's gonna take on the run, before it runs him down  
He's got far too many choices, he better make a few of them  
He wants to have it all, and wind up standin' tall  
I hope his dream never ends, I guess it just depends  
He's got one too many girlfriends  
  
Well there's so damn much writin' written on his walls  
I can't imagine that he doesn't read it  
Such a loud clear message screaming through the halls  
Keep your advice, he don't need it  
He's heard of living up to the truth, thinks it means giving up his youth  
He doesn't want to get a haircut, looking for a shortcut  
He needs a change, he needs more than a phone booth  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Whooo, there's anger and romance at every turn  
Whooo, be careful boy that you don't crash and burn  
You're in about as deep as you can get  
It's a matter of time before you get wet  
I wouldn't be in your shoes on a bet  
  
He's been runnin' lights for years, grindin' down those forward gears  
He's got a lady in the back seat, lady in the front seat  
Eyes on the road and whispers in both ears  
  
[Chorus]  
  
He's got one too many girlfriends... look out!

You made my decision  
Now take hold of my hand  
And I'll promise in front of the world  
To be your one true man  
  
I'll stand among my best friends  
They all understand  
That I'm changing for the better (yes I am)  
I'm your one true man  
  
I am your one true man  
Your one true man I am  
I'm gonna love you like no one man can  
Your one true man, I am  
  
Living wit me isn't easy  
My life has its demands  
But I want you to know that wherever I go  
I'm your one true man  
  
I am your one true man  
You one true man I am  
  
Sometimes I get so crazy  
You get so hard to hold on to  
But I won't let you go  
'Cause I know, I know who I am  
  
I am your one true man  
Your one true man I am  
I'm gonna love you like no one man can  
Your one true man I am

You may not know this but you are everything you've ever needed.  
Heaven with a touch of New York. Silver with a touch of gold.  
And I can see where you're goin', but I don't really know the way.  
It's got too many changes, too much rearranging,  
Too many ways to go astray.  
  
So if you want to go, let me go along  
I never walked that road alone  
I heard it was hard  
I heard it was long  
But we'll come back alive  
'Cause only the strong survive  
  
You walk on a wire, make a game of desire, pitchin' pennies down a wishing
well.  
You're leading the blind through there high and low times, but baby can you
lead yourself?  
So calm down, honey, forget about the money. If you need me I'll always be
there.  
Go ride your high horse alone of course  
'Cause if you need me I'll always care

Say you know you've got to run  
You know you've got to hide  
You don't know who to follow  
Or who is on your side  
You don't know where you're goin'  
You won't talk of where you've been  
And I may see you tomorrow  
Or nevermore again.  
  
And I've seen you in the cities  
I've seen you on the road  
And your face is all a-twisted  
'cause your brain is a heavy load  
And then you turn and ask me  
Say how will I ever know  
And you talk of all your searchin'  
But I think it's all for show  
  
Open up my friend  
Love someone if you can  
Go on, let her in  
Open up again.  
  
And I hear your mournful songs  
I hear your painful crys  
And I've seen the light of hunger  
Linger deep within your eyes  
And you talk about your sinkin'  
And what a hole you're in  
You expect for me to love you  
When you hate yourself my friend.  
  
And you've got yourself a potion  
Oh to keep you from your sleep  
In that dark and lonely hour  
Well I've heard you laugh and weep  
But you'll always be a-runnin'  
Runnin' till you find your doom  
'Cause you never face your lonely soul  
You never face the gloom.  
  
Open up my friend  
Love someone if you can  
Go on, let her in  
Open up again.

You touched me. you took me away.  
You left me confused when you said you couldn't stay.  
But now I know what you were trying to say.  
I can understand that I'm not the only one.  
But I believe our time is gonna come.  
  
I dream of you through every night,  
But you're not risin' with me, so I don't wanna see the light.  
Even if you can't come over, and I hoping that you might  
'cause when you're not here nothing's any fun.  
But I believe our time is gonna come.  
  
I believe our time is gonna come  
I believe our time is gonna come  
I believe our time is gonna  
I believe our time is gonna come

I found out just a little too late.  
I had my doubt, but I decided to wait.  
Even though I could feel somethin' comin'  
It came as such a surprise.  
I should have known when you first started  
Runnin' away before my eyes.  
  
I'm so out of season  
You left me cold and I'm standin' here freezin'.  
I'm so out of season now.  
  
I lost out.  
I wasn't playing to win.  
And I think about  
How I just took it all in.  
  
Just when I thought  
I couldn't get any higher  
You cut me down to size.  
I should have noticed  
When you put out the fire.  
Instead, I just closed my eyes.  
  
I'm so out of season.  
You left me cold and I'm standin' here freezin'.  
I'm so out of season now.  
  
I'm so out of season  
You let me go and you gave me no reason.  
I'm so out of season now.

Ridin' the storm out, waitin' for the thaw out  
On a full moon night in the Rocky Mountain winter.  
My wine bottle's low, watching for the snow  
Thinkin' about what I've been missin' in the city.  
  
And I'm not missin' a thing  
Watchin' the full moon crossing the range  
Ridin' the storm out  
Ridin' the storm out.  
  
My lady's beside me, she's there to guide me.  
She says that alone we've finally found home.  
The wind outside is frightening,  
but it's kinder than the lightning life in the city.  
It's a hard life to live but it gives back what you give.

Here I come again  
I don't really care to turn back  
Trying to find you directions  
But I seem to be losin' track  
  
I believe we ought to make a run for it  
Just to see how far we can go  
I ain't just around for the fun of it  
But until you try it, baby, you'll never know so  
  
Say you love me or say goodnight  
Say we've made up or on with the fight  
Cause there's no love lying' in the eyes of the night so,  
Say you love me or say goodnight  
  
There's no use hangin' on a memory  
No good livin' a lie  
I got no use for mediocrity  
You know tonight's the night  
We either do it or die

There's truth in your eyes, let me hear it from your lips  
Your tears say you cry, let your words be the whip, baby  
  
There's no reason anymore to live with all the pain  
Take this key, unlock the door, before it makes us both insane  
  
Spill your heart out to me, darlin', girl I really need to know  
  
[Chorus]  
Screams and whispers, don't be afraid  
Let's be more than lovers tonight  
Screams and whispers, let go of the pain  
Whatever we uncover, we can make it, make it alright  
  
Alright  
  
I know you've been alone, takin' care of yourself  
Girl don't you think it's time to trust somebody else?  
  
Try just once to let your guard down, you've got nothin' there to hide  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Spill your heart out to me, darlin', girl I really need to know  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
"Whatever we uncover, there'll be screams and whispers tonight"  
  
Alright

She's gonna love me like you never could  
She's gonna treat me like you never would  
She's gonna love me live I've never been loved before  
  
You should have grabbed me when you had your chance  
You got a little bit too big for your own leather pants  
I could have told you from the start  
No one's ever taken better care of your heart  
Now your gone, I don't care  
I've got a woman who will always be there, and...  
  
She's gonna love me like you never could  
She's gonna treat me like you never would  
She's gonna love me like I've never been loved before  
She's gonna spin me like a roulette wheel  
She's gonna treat me like I'm her last meal  
She's gonna love me and I keep comin' back for more  
  
Ooh she's gonna love me  
Ooh she's gonna love me  
She's gonna love me like her favorite hobby  
Throw me down and love me in the hotel lobby  
  
You figured I'd just always be around  
You thought we were so hot, you could have any boy in town  
Baby I've got some news for you  
I've got places to go and people to do  
Yeah, I cried a little when you said good-bye  
But now my eyes are filled with tears of joy, cus-  
She's gonna love me like you never could  
She's gonna treat me like you never would

Sundown, summer is fading.  
Run now, here the winter comes.  
Deep down, in some snowdrift.  
Frozen fire, thought you found the lift.  
  
It's a showdown, it's a Mexican standoff.  
And the river, is the prize.  
To float away on her current,  
To the sea lover, to the sea.  
  
And I know there's a song in the wind to the sky.  
And I know there's a song somewhere for you and I.  
What I don't know is if we'll hear it.  
I'm losin' spirit, woman sing to me.

Sophisticated lady try'n to change my ways  
Just because you're caught in your social maze.  
I think it's about time that you realize  
Your money and your power's got you mesmerized.  
Pretty lady.  
Get back.  
Pretty lady.  
Sophisticated lady put your blue jeans on,  
You're anybody's baby when your mama's gone.  
  
Educated lady with your college degree,  
Amazes me why you just can't see.  
Learned ev'rything from your books on the shelf,  
But no one ever taught you how to think for yourself.  
  
Pretty lady.  
Get back.  
Pretty lady.  
Sophisticated lady put your blue jeans on,  
You're anybody's baby when your mama's gone.  
  
Sophisticated lady , take a lesson from me,  
I can help you be what you want to be.  
Together we'll see many brighter days,  
If it takes forever, gonna change your ways. pretty lady.  
Sweet thing.  
Pretty lady.  
Sophisticated lady put your blue jeans on,  
You're anybody's baby when your mama's gone.

Go home, pretender  
I think this is the end here  
It's been a long time decidin'  
But I think I've found the right end.  
  
You're gonna go away, start a new life  
Forget today, start a new life  
Start a new life.  
  
Hopes crushed and battered  
But you laugh as if it didn't matter  
This joke is gonna turn blue  
And I won't be there to hold you.  
  
You're gonna go away, start a new life  
Forget today, start a new life  
Start a new life.  
  
Go home, debater  
It was soon and now it's later  
And that's only a piece of paper  
So don't you stand there a-laughin' and a-wavin' it.  
  
You're gonna go away, start a new life  
Forget today, start a new life  
Start a new life.

Heard it from a friend who  
Heard it from a friend who  
Heard it from another you been messin' around  
They say you got a boy friend  
You're up there every weekend  
They're talkin' about you and it's bringin' me down  
  
But I know the neighborhood  
And talk is cheap when the story is good  
And the tales grow taller on down the line  
But I'm telling you, babe  
That I don't think it's true, babe  
And even if it is keep this in mind  
  
You take it on the run baby  
If that's the way you want it baby  
Then I don't want you around  
I don't believe it, not for a minute  
You're under the gun so you take it on the run  
  
You're thinking up your white lies  
You're putting on your bedroom eyes  
You say you're coming home but you won't say when  
But I can feel it coming  
If you leave tonight keep running  
And you need never look back again  
  
You take it on the run baby  
If that's the way you want it baby  
Then I don't want you around  
I don't believe it, not for a minute  
You're under the gun so you take it on the run  
  
You take it on the run baby  
If that's the way you want it baby  
Then I don't want you around  
I don't believe it, not for a minute  
You're under the gun so you take it on the run  
  
You take it on the run baby  
If that's the way you want it baby  
Then I don't want you around  
I don't believe it, not for a minute  
You're under the gun so you take it on the run  
  
Heard it from a friend who  
Heard it from a friend who  
Heard it from another you been messin' around

I always wondered if I could give  
Enough love for a woman to live on  
But as I grow, as I learn and live,  
I find it's best to forget and forgive.  
  
I could be dancing on the ocean.  
I could be singing to the sea.  
But I am poetry in motion.  
I'm yours!  
  
When I was young I was so filled with love,  
Jealousy stung but never deep enough  
'Cause I feel rain falling from above.  
I only thirst for your to share my cup.  
  
I could be dancing on the ocean.  
I could be singing to the sea.  
But I am poetry in motion.  
I'm yours, people. Take me.

When she turned away, you know it was just in time  
Cause I'd used up all my strength  
And you can't let a woman see you cryin'  
And you know it's real  
She's not gonna change her mind  
You choose not to change your ways  
Though she begged you a thousand times  
  
And you don't understand  
And you want to be a man about it  
In time you'll learn to live without it  
And you know that you'll survive  
But still sometimes you doubt it  
If you can stand a little rain  
You're gonna grow again  
Cause you know that when love dies  
The heart survives  
  
Your stare at the empty walls  
Inside of this vacant home  
You walk through these hollow halls  
And at night you sleep alone  
  
And you don't understand  
And you want to be a man about it  
In time you'll learn to live without it  
And you know that you'll survive  
But still sometimes you doubt it  
If you can stand a little rain  
You're gonna grow again  
Cause you know that when love dies  
The heart survives  
  
You've been over it so many times in your head  
Looking for a hidden message of hope  
In something she said  
Still you find nothing to make this bad dream end  
Tell me, how many sleepless nights will you spend  
  
And you don't understand  
And you want to be a man about it  
In time you'll learn to live without it  
And you know that you'll survive  
But still sometimes you doubt it  
If you can stand a little rain  
You're gonna grow again  
Cause you know that when love dies  
The heart survives

It's the season of the golden leaves  
When the wind turns into a bitter breeze  
  
I was walking through the oak leaves on the hill  
With my lady, oh she's got a strong will  
And I see her through these ever-clouded eyes  
This time it's goodbye and I can't answer why  
  
Maybe it's because I ain't quite shy of running yet  
Or maybe it's because I'm the hometown boy in the spotlight  
But my roots ain't in the ground  
They're on the road  
  
Settle down was all I ever heard from her  
"If you cared," she said, "you would weigh my words"  
But my life doesn't ride on the factory road  
Baby, don't ask me why, I can't even pretend to know

I'll be your builder, skilled at the tasks you ask  
I'll be you sinner baby, allowing my soul to be sold  
But I'm drawing the line there woman  
I ain't takin' no more abuse  
I'll be puttin' my foot down and then  
Throw the chains away  
  
Locked in your prison, much too late for escape  
Your walls are closin' in, let's tie the knot while we're hot  
  
Bells are ringing, but my ears won't hear  
And you're comin' for me, with the chains and the key

Through the window, I slip away  
Into the darkness, time has come  
I must use caution, summer nights are here, I'll race  
For the shadows, I'll make a trail  
No one can follow, and all I feel  
Is the breeze rushin by my face  
  
Runnin free through the night in the street  
Like it best when I feel the heat  
I know my baby's waitin just for me  
  
Creepin', through her neighborhood  
I hope nobody, has seen or heard  
My intentions, are driven by this flame inside  
  
I see her light on, her silhouette's  
In the window, she's waiting for  
My arrival, on this summer night  
  
Runnin' free through the night in the street  
Like it best when I feel the heat  
Runnin' free through the night in the street  
I know my baby's waiting just for me  
Runnin' free through the night in the street  
I like it best when I fell the heat, oh yeah  
  
Through her window, she slips away  
I hear her heartbeat  
High emotion, takes us where we've never been before

You ask how long I'll love you  
It's hard to explain but I'll try  
Tell me how long has the sun been shining  
Above us in the sky?  
  
Till the last day of forever,  
If I have it my way we'll stay together  
Till the rivers run dry I'll be loving you.  
Till the mountains have crumbled  
I'll always be true  
And if for some reason you say goodbye  
Ask me how long I would cry  
Till all the rivers run dry  
  
This path that we're walking  
May be rough and rocky sometimes  
But we'll believe in one another  
Whatever we find  
  
And when you need a hand to guide you  
I will be there walking beside you  
Till the rivers run dry

It's all on my shoulders  
And it was gettin' harder to bear  
Each day I was gettin' older  
And I was startin' to show the wear  
Tonight I'm gonna get it all  
Gonna lay my work on the shelf?  
  
Tonight, tonight, I'm comin' home to you  
Tonight, tonight, I'm comin' home to you It was a hard run this time momma  
And it ain't ever gonna get easier  
I'm searchin' through my memories  
And I can't remember of a year?  
But tonight I'm gonna get it all  
Gonna lay my work on the shelf  
  
[Repeat x6]  
Tonight, tonight, I'm comin' home to you

She doesn't like the tough guys.  
They think that they can do anything they please.  
But they're gonna get a surprise,  
When she brings them to their knees.  
  
'Cause she doesn't like the rough guys.  
They act like they can have any girl they choose.  
They've got tricks, but my baby got wise,  
So in case you haven't heard the news,  
  
She doesn't like the tough guys.  
She doesn't like the rough guys.  
So find some one you own size,  
'Cause she's not afraid of you.  
  
She doesn't like the tough guys.  
She thinks that they've got brains all where they sit.  
They think they're full of fire,  
She thinks they're full of shit.  
  
She doesn't like the tough guys.  
She says she's heard enough lies.  
She's gonna call your bluff, guys.  
And you better believe it's true.  
  
She don't like you.

I've been sittin' back quietly,  
Watchin' as my spirit fades.  
As all of my attempts to do rightly  
Get treated like some kind of terrorist raids.  
Maybe I ask too much from you  
Well I ain't gettin' too much in return.  
I'm doin' my best to love you baby,  
But the wheels are beginning to turn.  
When you're cut down to the bone.  
You bleed but it heals.  
You hurt still you must carry on.  
'cus the wheels are turnin' -- the feeling's burnin'  
The thrill's returnin'  
My soul is yearnin' -- my heart is churnin'  
The wheels are turnin' again.  
Maybe I'm actin' irrational  
Hope I don't hurt your heart  
This whole problem is only geographical  
I just need some kind of new start.  
And if I can't get inspired 'round here,  
I'm going out to the world and learn.  
There's action in my soul tonight.  
I feel the wheels are beginning to turn.  
When you're cut down to the bone.  
You bleed but it heals.  
You hurt still you must carry on.  
'cus the wheels are turnin' -- the feeling's burnin'  
The thrill's returnin'  
My soul is yearnin' -- my heart is churnin'  
The wheels are turnin' again.  
I remember the last time I got on one of these rolls.  
I learned all about the tolls that it takes.  
I get something in my mind -- it begins to unfold  
I get out in the cold -- I can't do what I'm told  
I get out of control -- I can't hold on to the brakes  
When you're cut down to the bone.  
You bleed but it heals.  
You hurt still you must carry on.  
'cus the wheels are turnin' -- the feeling's burnin'  
The thrill's returnin'  
My soul is yearnin' -- my heart is churnin'  
The wheels are turnin' again.  

Say goodbye, look to the sky  
Set your course on into the night  
Say goodbye, hold your head high  
Wherever you're goin' it's alright  
Things must change  
You know they always do get re-arranged  
No reflection on you  
Just face the danger and follow it through  
And the change is gonna be for the best  
Well, I know how crazy it feels when you go  
Go out shufflin' your heels  
So take it slow and make only good deals  
You're a young man and it's time to go west, ooh yes  
You say goodbye, you look to the sky  
Set your course on into the night  
You say goodbye, you hold your head high  
Wherever you're goin' it's alright  
Take a chance, go on make your move  
Nothin' fancy, you got nothin' to prove  
Just make a stance, you know we're countin' on you  
You are the one with the vision  
So move out, move ahead of the fear  
Have no doubt in your mind  
There's a very clear out and someone must steer  
It is you who must make the decision, ooh yeah  
Say goodbye, look to the sky  
Set your course on into the night  
Say goodbye, hold your head high  
Wherever you're goin' it's alright  
Say goodbye, look to the sky  
Set your course on into the night  
Say goodbye, hold your head high  
Wherever you're goin' it's alright  
Say goodbye, look to the sky  
Set your course on into the night  
Say goodbye, hold your head high  
Wherever you're goin' it's alright  
Say goodbye, look to the sky  
Set your course on into the night  
Say goodbye, hold your head high  
Wherever you're goin' it's alright  

My eyes are aching from the weight on them  
The pain of living is such a bore  
To make you happy I must bend for you  
But I can't take it anymore.  
  
And all the morning birds may laugh at me  
But they've got the same straight jobs to do  
And I can't see who is the biggest fool of all  
With my eyes all scarred from a whiskey night.  
  
I stumbled around with my eyes half closed  
And curse the sun for being so bright  
I hold you close, feel your warmth and wonder why  
The river of life for you runs right.  
  
And all the morning birds may laugh at me  
But they've got the same straight jobs to do  
And I can't see who is the biggest fool of all  
With my eyes all scarred from a whiskey night.  
  
My head is poundin' as I'm sittin' here  
And my mind's not workin' like it should  
Come on, guitar, you've got to save me  
And get me back feelin' like I should.

Outlaw running from the law but he's  
Got nowhere to run to  
Big law he broke it and ran faster  
Than the lightning bolt  
Chasing down the golden sun, running away  
From the blue  
He ran with no direction in mind, just  
Running like a crazy colt  
  
And he's gonna run let the four winds slap his face  
He's gonna fly, let the sky be his guide  
He's gonna lie beneath a blanket of stars  
He's gonna run, wild as the western wind  
  
Bad lands are sheltering him, maybe Dakota's  
His home  
Red man's become his friend, when no one else  
Would have him  
There's an Indian woman who keeps him from  
Being alone  
She stands tall by his side, but the law's  
Got him out on a limb

Have you ever ridden horses through a rainstorm  
Or led a lion through a busy street bazaar  
There are many things I'd love to turn you on to  
But somehow I feel they're safer where they are.  
  
Well some people in bound infatuation  
While some others spell depression as the law  
Someone's mother getting no imagination  
So beware then, baby, sin is at everyone's door.  
  
Don't be the man I know with no expressions lord  
Ain't got none at all  
Pity the man I know with no expressions lord  
Ain't got none at all  
  
But you'll never, no you'll never see this man laughing  
Come to think of it, I've never seen this man cry  
But you might by sitting quietly hear him singing  
By and by, he'll stop and sigh,  
His voice will even start to speak and he will say goodbye.  
  
Have you ever ridden horses through a rainstorm  
Or led a lion through a busy street bazaar  
There are many things I'd love to turn you on to  
But somehow I feel they're safer where they are.

Expanse of land that would cushion your fall  
As you tumble down from the sky  
Marble cakes of delicious design and  
They're yours, you can fly  
  
I have no wings but I wish that I had  
I have dreams about it every night  
And I can soar with the wind in my face  
On my flight, on my flight  
  
Won't you try and just bother  
Won't you bother to care  
And then somehow or other  
You'll be there  
  
Cotton clouds look like mountainous land  
Covered by December snow  
And I can see from my majestic view  
Down below, yes I know

Why can't we see eye to eye?  
I feel you don't want to try  
Cause you won't see me as I am  
If you can't accept in me  
The good with the bad  
Then you won't see me cry again  
You won't see me  
  
Why'd you want to go and walk away?  
I have got some things to say  
But you won't see me as I am  
If you can't accept in me  
The good with the bad  
Then you won't see me try again  
You won't see me  
I'll be movin on, I'll be long gone  
  
You are in my range  
I am in your sight  
You say, things don't change  
I say, they just might  
  
You just might find that you can trust in me  
If you look at more than just what you want to see  
But you won't see me as I am  
If you can't accept in me  
The good with the bad  
Then you won't see me around here again  
You won't see me  
I'll be movin on, I'll be long gone
