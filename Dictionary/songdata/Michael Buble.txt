(Feat. Chris Botti)  
  
I've been so many places in my life and time  
I've sung a lot of songs and I've made some bad rhymes  
I've acted out my life in stages with ten thousand people watching  
Oh, but we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you  
I know your image of me is what I hope to be, I've treated you unkindly  
Oh, but Darling can't you see that, there's no one more important to me  
Baby, baby, can't you see through me, 'cause we're alone now  
And I'm singing this song to you, you taught me precious secrets  
Of a true love withholding nothing, you came out in front  
When I was hiding, yeah, yeah, but now it's so much better  
If my words don't quite come together, please listen to the melody  
'Cause my love is in there somewhere hiding  
I love you in a place where there is no space or time, I love you for my life  
You are a friend of mine, and when my life is over  
Remember, remember, remember when we were together  
And we are alone now, and I was singing this song to you  
We were alone, and I was singing, yeah singing  
We were alone, and I was singing this song for you  
Singing my song, I'm singing my song for you

Way back when we started  
There was a part of me that knew  
One did every heartache and I would lose myself to you  
  
And I walked all night  
Watching the sun and city lights  
Thinking of you  
Wondering where I lose my mind  
  
After all I'm excited that you're in my life again  
After all I'm delighted  
To be back when we begin  
I believe that you can fall in love with me again  
And we'll both be standin' tall after all  
  
Way back when we started  
There was a part of you that knew  
I was all that you wanted  
But only shadows fill the room  
I was lost all right  
Lost in the sleepless empty nights  
Dreamin' of you  
And in those dreams you were mine  
  
After all reunited  
Yeah you're in my arms again  
After all I'm delighted  
Cause our we're lovers and we're friends  
I believe that I can  
Fall in love with you again  
And I'll catch you when you fall  
After all  
  
I was lost alright  
Lost in the sleepless empty nights  
Dreamin' of you  
And in those dreams you still mine  
  
After all I'm excited that you're in my life again  
After all I'm delighted  
To be back when we begin  
I believe that you can fall in love with me again  
'Cuz I love you. I'll catch you when you fall  
Oh we're united and we've made it after all  
And we'll both be standing tall  
After all  
After all babe  
Oh after all  
After all  
After all

All of me why not take all of me  
Can't you see I'm no good without you  
  
Take my lips I want to lose them  
Take my arms I'll never use them  
  
Your goodbyes they left me with eyes that cry  
How can I get along without you  
  
You took the part that once was my heart  
So why not take all of me  
  
Your goodbye left me with eyes that are crying  
Now I'm lost without you  
  
And now that you took that part  
That used to be my heart  
  
All of me why not take all of me  
Can't you see that I'm a mess without you  
  
You took the part that used to be my heart  
So why not take all of me

I've got a yearning to caress you  
One thought keeps burning in my soul  
A hungry yearning to posess you  
Is far beyond control  
I want your love for now, forever  
I want your heart and soul  
My life I give to you Anema E Core  
I only live for you Anema E Core  
  
I have but one desire  
And it's to love you  
With all my heart  
With all my soul  
My whole life through  
From stars I'll build your crown  
And kneel before you  
I pray you'll take my hand  
For I adore you  
Open up the door leading to Heaven  
A Heaven, mine and yours, Anema E Core

Another night, another drink  
Another time to contemplate and think  
Will I ever, ever have anyone to love  
  
It's not that I don't try  
Maybe I try too hard  
Seems like I'm living a lie  
So there's a game I just won't learn  
And I wonder will I always be alone  
I take a sip and wonder  
Why I haven't anyone to love  
  
I guess I'll say goodnight  
My drink's done and it's morning light  
Sorry my friend but you see  
What other ending could there be  
And I wonder will I always be alone?  
I take a drink and wonder  
Will I ever have anyone to love?

Well now it takes more than a robin  
To make the winter go  
  
And it takes two lips for fire  
To melt away the snow  
Well it takes two hearts a cookin'  
To make a fire grow  
And baby you've got what it takes  
Now listen honey  
  
Alright baby  
  
You know it takes  
A lot of kissin'  
To make a romance sweep  
Oh it takes a lot of lovin'  
To make my life complete  
  
Oh, well it takes somebody special  
To knock me off my feet  
And baby, you've got what it takes  
Hmm  
  
I said,  
Oh,  
Uh huh,  
Oh,  
Oh you've got just what it takes  
Because it takes more  
Than an effort, to stay away from you  
And it takes more than a lifetime  
To prove that I'll be true  
Yeah,  
But it takes somebody special  
To make me say I do  
And baby, you've got what it takes  
  
Ah ha,  
Oh,  
Ah ha,  
Oh,  
Oh you've got just what it takes  
Oh, because it takes a lot of effort  
To stay away from you  
And it takes more than a lifetime  
To prove that I'll be true  
Well it takes somebody special  
To make me say I do  
And baby, you've got what it takes  
Come on say that again honey  
And baby, you've got what it takes  
One more time, come on  
And baby, you've got what it takes  
You got it, you got it  
Mm hmm, you know you've got what it takes  
You've got it, you got it  
Baby don't you know you've got what it takes  
You got it, you got it

Somewhere, beyond the sea  
Somewhere, waiting for me  
My lover stands on golden sand  
And watches the ships  
That go sailing  
  
Somewhere, beyond the sea  
She's there, watching for me  
If I could fly like birds on high  
Then straight to her heart  
I'll go sailing  
  
It's far, beyond the stars  
It's near beyond the moon  
And oh, beyond a doubt  
My heart will lead me there soon  
We'll meet, beyond the shore  
We'll kiss just like before  
Happy we'll be beyond the sea  
And ever again, I'll go sailin'  
  
And oh, beyond a doubt  
My heart will lead me there soon  
Oh we'll meet and oh we'll meet beyond the shore  
We'll kiss just as before  
Happy we-will be beyond the sea  
And ever again, I'll go sailin'

Won't you come home, Bill Bailey, won't you come home?

Wise men say only fools rush in  
But I can't help falling in love with you

Take my hand  
Take my whole life too

Your smile gives you away.

It's finally safe to stay!

Stockings are hung with care  
The children sleep with one eye open  
Now there's more than toys at stake  
'Cause I'm older now but not done hoping  
  
The twinkling of the lights  
A Santa kid who's filled with hustle  
Old saint Nick has taken flight  
With a heart on board so please be careful  
  
Each year I ask for many different things  
But now I know what my heart wants you to bring  
So please just fall in love with me this Christmas  
There's nothing else that I would need this Christmas  
Won't be wrapped under the tree  
I want something that lasts forever  
So kiss me on this cold December night  
  
A cheer that smells of pine  
A house that's filled with joy and laughter  
The mistletoe says stand in line  
Loneliness is what I've captured  
Oh but this evening can be a holy night  
  
Let's cozy on up our fireplace  
And dim those Christmas lights  
  
So please just fall in love with me this Christmas  
There's nothing else that you would need this Christmas  
Won't be wrapped under the tree want something that lasts forever  
So kiss me on this cold December night.

So kiss me on this cold December night.  
  
They call it the season of giving  
I'm here, yours for the taking  
They call it the season of giving I'm here I'm yours

Stars shining bright above you, night breezes seem to whisper, "I love you".  
Birds singing in the sycamore tree, "Dream a little dream of me".  
Say "nighty-night" and kiss me. Just hold me tight and tell me you'll missme.  
While I'm alone and blue as can be, dream a little dream of me.  
  
Stars fading, but I linger on, dear.  
Still craving your kiss, I'm longing to linger till dawn, dear.  
Just saying this: Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you.  
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you.  
But in your dreams whatever they be, dream a little dream of me.  
  
Stars fading, but I linger on, dear.  
Still craving your kiss, I'm longing to linger till dawn, dear.  
Just saying this: Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you.  
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you.  
But in your dreams whatever they be, dream a little dream of me.

You're a falling star, You're the get away car.  
You're the line in the sand when I go too far.  
You're the swimming pool, on an August day.  
And you're the perfect thing to say.  
  
And you play it coy, But it's kinda cute.  
Ah, When you smile at me you know exactly what you do.  
Baby don't pretend, that you don't know it's true.  
Cause you can see it when I look at you.

You're every line, you're every word, you're everything.  
  
You're a carousel, you're a wishing well,  
And you light me up, when you ring my bell.  
You're a mystery, you're from outer space,  
You're every minute of my everyday.  
  
And I can't believe, uh that I'm your man!  
And I get to kiss you baby just because I can.  
Whatever comes our way, ah we'll see it through,  
And you know that's what our love can do.

Never know how much I love you  
Never know how much I care  
When you put your arms around me  
I get a fever that's so hard to bear  
  
You give me fever when you kiss me  
Fever, when you hold me tight  
Fever in the morning  
Fever all through the night  
  
Sun lights up the daytime  
Moon lights up the night  
I light up when you call my name  
And you know I'm gonna treat you right  
  
You give me fever when you kiss me  
Fever, when you hold me tight  
Fever in the morning  
Fever all through the night  
  
Everybody's got the fever  
That is something you all know  
Fever isn't such a new thing  
Fever started long ago  
  
Romeo loved Juliet  
Juliet, she felt the same  
When he put his arms around her  
He said, "Julie, baby, you're my flame"  
  
Thou givest fever when we kisseth  
Fever with thy flaming youth  
Fever, I'm afire  
Fever, yeah, I burn for sooth  
  
Captain Smith and Pocahontas  
Had a very mad affair  
When her daddy tried to kill him  
She said, "Daddy, oh, don't you dare"  
  
"He gives me fever with his kisses  
Fever when he holds me tight  
Fever, I'm his misses  
Daddy, won't you treat him right", go  
  
Now you've listened to my story  
Here's the point that I have made  
Chicks were born to give you fever  
Be it Fahrenheit or centigrade  
  
They give you fever when you kiss them  
Fever, if you live and learn  
Fever till you sizzle  
What a lovely way to burn  
  
What a lovely way to burn  
What a lovely way to burn  
What a lovely way to burn

For once in my life  
I've got someone who needs me  
Someone I've needed so long  
For once unafraid  
I can go where life leads me  
And somehow I know I'll be strong  
  
For once I can touch  
What my heart used to dream of  
Long before I knew  
Someone warm like you  
Could make my dreams come true  
  
For once in my life  
I won't let sorrow hurt me  
Not like it's hurt me before  
For once I've got someone  
I know won't desert me  
'Cause I'm not alone anymore  
  
For once I can say  
This is mine, you can't take it  
As long as I've got love I know I can make it  
For once in my life  
I've got someone who needs me  
  
At least I can say  
This is mine, you can't take it  
As long as I've got love I know I can make it  
For once in my life  
I've got someone who needs me  
For once in my life  
I find someone  
I've got someone who needs me

Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul,  
With a corncob pipe and a button nose  
And two eyes made out of coal.  
  
Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale, they say,  
He was made of snow but the children know  
How he came to life one day.  
  
There must have been some magic in  
That Old top hat they found.  
For when they placed it on his head  
He began to dance around.  
  
Oh, Frosty the snowman  
Was alive as he could be,  
And the children say he could laugh and play  
Just the same as you and me.

Frosty the snowman  
Knew the sun was hot that day,  
So he said, "Let's run  
And we'll have some fun  
Now before I melt away. "  
  
Frosty the snowman  
Had to hurry on his way,  
But he waved goodbye saying,  
"Don't you cry,  
I'll be back again some day. "

Georgia, Georgia  
The whole day through  
Just an old sweet song  
Keeps Georgia on my mind  
On my mind  
  
I said Georgia, mmm, Georgia  
A song of you  
Comes as sweet and clear  
As moonlight through the pines  
  
Other arms reach out to me  
Other eyes smile tenderly  
Still in peaceful dreams I see  
The road leads back to you  
  
Oh, Georgia, Georgia  
No peace I find  
Just an old sweet song, old sweet song  
Keeps Georgia on my mind  
  
Oh, just an old sweet song  
Keeps Georgia on my mind  
  
There'll always be Georgia

Do you remember me?  
I sat upon your knee  
I wrote to you with childhood fantasies  
Well, I'm all grown-up now  
Can you still help somehow?  
I'm not a child, but my heart still can dream  
  
So here's my lifelong wish  
My grown-up Christmas list  
Not for myself, but for a world in need  
  
No more lives torn apart  
That wars would never start  
And time would heal all hearts  
Every man would have a friend  
That right would always win  
And love would never end  
This is my grown-up Christmas list  
  
What is this illusion called the innocence of youth?  
Maybe only in that blind belief can we ever find the truth  
  
No more lives torn apart  
That wars would never start  
And time would heal our hearts  
Every man would have a friend  
That right would always win  
And love would never end  
  
This is my grown-up Christmas list  
This is my only lifelong wish  
This is my grown-up Christmas list

When I look into your eyes  
I see sunshine  
The coulds are blown away  
I hope you're here to stay  
'Cause I've got me needing more of you  
Guess I'm falling for you  
  
You walk away  
My eyes caress you  
Then you turn and smile  
You've caught me thinkin' of love with you  
Guess I'm falling, I may be falling for you  
  
Since I met you days are brighter  
Life's uneven loads are lighter  
When I hear you whisper the words I long to hear dear  
Now I look into your eyes  
I'm lost in knowing that you are all I want  
My need for you is growing  
Guess I'm falling, I think I'm falling for you  
Think about falling for me too

Have I told you lately that I love you  
Could I tell you once again somehow  
Have I told, with all my heart and soul how I adore you  
Well darlin' I'm tellin' you no  
  
Have I told you lately when I'm sleepin'  
Every dream I dream is you somehow  
Have I told you why the nights are long when you're not with me  
Well darlin' I'm telling you now  
  
My heart would break in 2 if I should loose you  
It's no good without you anyhow  
Have I told you lately that I love you  
Well darling, I'm telling you now  
  
Have I told you how the nights are long  
When you're not with me  
Well darling, I'm telling you now  
  
My heart would break in 2 if I should loose you  
It's no good without you anyhow  
Have I told you lately that I love you  
Well darling, I'm telling you now  
My sweet darling, I'm telling you now.  
Darling, I'm telling you now.

Didn't they always say we were the lucky ones?  
I guess that we were once  
Babe, we were once  
  
But luck will leave you 'cause  
It is a faithless friend  
And in the end when life has got you down  
You've got someone here that you can wrap your arms around  
  
So hold on to me tight  
Hold on to me tonight  
We are stronger here together  
Than we could ever be alone  
So hold on to me  
Don't you ever let me go  
  
There's a thousand ways for things to fall apart  
But it's no one's fault  
No it's not my fault  
  
Maybe all the plans we made might not work out  
But I have no doubt even though it's hard to see  
I've got faith in us and I believe in you and me  
  
So hold on to me tight  
Hold on, I promise it'll be alright  
'Cause it's you and me together  
And baby all we've got is time  
So hold on to me, hold on to me tonight  
  
There's so many dreams that we have given up  
Take a look at all we've got  
And with this kind of love  
What we've got here is enough  
  
So hold on to me tight  
Hold on, I promise it'll be alright  
'Cause we are stronger here together  
Then we could ever be alone  
Just hold on to me

Hold on to me tonight  
They always say we were the lucky ones

Have a holly, jolly Christmas,  
It's the best time of the year  
I don't know if there'll be snow,  
But have a cup of cheer.  
  
Have a holly, jolly Christmas,  
And when you walk down the street  
Say hello to friends you know  
And everyone you meet.  
  
Oh, ho, the mistletoe  
Is hung where you can see,  
Somebody waits for you,  
Kiss her once for me.  
  
Have a holly jolly Christmas,  
And in case you didn't hear,  
Oh by golly, have a holly jolly Christmas this year  
  
Oh, ho, the mistletoe

Somebody waits for you,  
Kiss her once for me.

And in case you didn't hear,  
Oh by golly, have a holly jolly Christmas this year

Could you be a teenage idol  
Could you be a movie star  
When I turn on my TV  
Will you smile and wave at me  
Tellin' Oprah who you are is strange  
So you want to be a rock star  
With blue eyed bunny's in your bed  
Well remember when you're rich that you sold yourself for this,  
You'll be famous 'cause you're dead.  
  
So don't go higher for desire  
Put it in your head  
Baby Hollywood is dead  
You can find it in yourself.  
  
I don't want to take you dancing  
When you're dancing with the world  
Well you can flash your caviar and your million dollar car  
I don't need that kind of girl  
But you could be that next sensation  
Or will you set the latest style  
You don't need a catchy song  
'Cause the kids will sing along  
When you shoot it with a smile  
  
So don't go higher for desire  
Put it in your head  
Baby Hollywood is dead  
You can find it in yourself.  
  
So don't fly higher, for your fire  
Put it in your head  
Baby Hollywood is dead  
You can find it in yourself.  
Keep it on your head Hollywood is dead.  
  
Well you can do the mighty tango  
You can strut your little thing  
You can swing from vine to vine  
While the kiddies wait in line  
With the money in their hands  
  
But if you get to California  
Save a piece of gold for me  
If it's the only thing you'll save  
Then I'll bet you'll never wave when I watch you on tv.  
  
So don't go higher for desire  
Put it in your head  
Baby Hollywood is dead you can find it in yourself.  
  
So don't fly higher, for your fire  
Put it in your head  
Baby Hollywood is dead  
You can find it in yourself.  
  
Keep on loving what is true and the world will come to you,  
You can find it in yourself  
Love what is true and the world will come to you,  
You can find it in yourself  
  
No no no no no  
Keep it in your head, Hollywood is dead  
Come, come Hollywood is dead babe woo hoo  
Oh Hollywood is dead yeah yeah  
Oh Hollywood is dead babe woo hoo  
Keep on loving what is true and the world will come to you,  
Hollywood is dead, get it in your head, Hollywood is dead

Another summer day  
Is come and gone away  
In Paris and Rome  
But I want to go home  
Mmm  
  
Maybe surrounded by  
A million people, I  
Still feel all alone  
I just want to go home  
Oh, I miss you, you know  
  
And I've been keeping all the letters that I wrote to you  
Each one a line or two  
'I'm fine, baby, how are you?'  
Well, I would send them, but I know that it's just not enough  
My words were cold and flat  
And you deserve more than that  
  
Another aeroplane  
Another sunny place  
I'm lucky I know  
But I want to go home  
Mmm, I've got to go home  
  
Let me go home  
I'm just too far from where you are  
I want to come home  
  
And I feel just like I'm living someone else's life  
It's like I just stepped outside  
When everything was going right  
And I know just why you could not  
Come along with me  
But this was not your dream  
But you always believe in me  
  
Another winter day has come  
And gone away  
And even Paris and Rome  
And I want to go home  
Let me go home  
  
And I'm surrounded by  
A million people, I  
Still feel alone  
Oh, let me go home  
Oh, I miss you, you know  
  
Let me go home  
I've had my run  
Baby, I'm done  
I gotta go home  
Let me go home  
It will all be alright  
I'll be home tonight  
I'm coming back home

I can think of younger days when living for my life  
Was everything a man could want to do  
I could never see tomorrow, but I was never told about the sorrow  
  
And how can you mend a broken heart?  
How can you stop the rain from falling down?  
How can you stop the sun from shining?  
What makes the world go round?  
How can you mend this broken man?  
How can a loser ever win?  
Please help me mend my broken heart and let me live again  
  
I can still feel the breeze that rustles through the trees  
And misty memories of days gone by  
We could never see tomorrow, no one said a word about the sorrow  
  
And how can you mend a broken heart?  
How can you stop the rain from falling down?  
How can you stop the sun from shining?  
What makes the world go round?  
How can you mend this broken man?  
How can a loser ever win?  
Please help me mend my broken heart and let me live again

Needed the shelter of someone's arms  
And there you were  
Needed someone to understand my ups and downs  
And there you were  
With sweet love and devotion  
Touching my emotions  
  
I wanna stop  
And thank you baby  
I just wanna stop  
And thank you baby  
Whoa Oh Yeah  
  
How sweet it is to be loved by you  
How sweet it is to be loved by you  
  
I close my eyes at night  
Wondering where would I be without you in my life?  
Everything I did was such a bore  
Everywhere I went you know  
I'd been there before  
But you brighten up for me all my days  
With a love so sweet in so many ways  
I wanna stop  
And thank you baby  
I just wanna stop and thank you baby  
Whoa, oh  
  
How sweet it is to be loved by you  
How sweet it is to be loved by you  
  
You were better to me than I was to myself  
For me there is you and there ain't nobody else  
I wanna stop  
And thank you baby  
I just wanna stop  
And thank you baby  
Oh, whoa, oh  
  
How sweet it is to be loved by you  
How sweet it is to be loved by you  
How sweet it is to be loved by you  
How sweet it is to be loved by you

I wish you bluebirds in the spring  
To give your heart a song to sing  
I wish you health  
And more than wealth  
I wish you love  
  
And in July a lemonade  
To cool you in some leafy glade  
I wish you health  
And more than wealth  
I wish you love  
  
My breaking heart and I agree  
That you and I could never be  
So with my best  
My very best  
I set you free  
  
I wish you shelter from the storm  
And a cozy fire to keep you warm  
And most of all  
When snowflakes fall  
I wish you love

Meglio stasera  
Baby go go go  
Or as we natives say  
"Fa subito!"  
If you're ever gonna kiss me  
It had better be tonight  
While the mandolins are playing  
And stars are bright  
If you've anything to tell me  
It had better be tonight  
Or somebody else may tell me  
And whisper the words just right  
Meglio stasera  
Baby go go go  
Or as we natives say  
"Fa subito!"  
If you're ever gonna hold me  
It had better be tonight  
Or somebody else might hold me  
And make me feel just right  
For this poor Americano  
Who knows little of your speech  
Meglio stasera  
Baby go go go  
Or as we natives say  
"Fa subito!"  
Be a nice Italiano  
And start to teach  
Show me how in old Milano  
Lovers hold each other tight  
But I want you sweet paesano  
It had better be tonight  
Meglio stasera  
Baby go go go  
Or as we natives say  
"Fa subito!"

I've got a crush on you, my sweetie pie  
All the day and night-time hear me sigh  
I never had the least notion that  
I could fall with so much emotion  
  
Could you coo, could you care  
For a cunning cottage that we could share  
The world will pardon my mush  
'cause I have got a crush, my baby, on you  
  
Ohh, Could you coo, baby, could you care  
For a cunning cottage  
We could share  
Now the world will pardon my mush  
'cause I have got a crush, ohh, you know I've got it bad for you

I've got you under my skin  
I've got you deep in the heart of me  
So deep in my heart, that you're really a part of me  
I've got you under my skin  
  
I've tried so not to give in  
I've said to myself this affair never gonna swing so well  
So why should I try to resist, when baby will I know damn well  
That I've got you under my skin  
  
I'd sacrifice anything come what might  
For the sake of having you near  
In spite of a warning voice that comes in the night  
And repeats, repeats in my ear  
  
Don't you know little fool, you'll never win  
Why not use your mentality, come on step up to reality  
But each time I do, just the thought of you  
Makes me stop before I begin  
'Cause I've got you under my skin

I send flowers everyday  
But you just turn them away  
And my letters go unanswered  
So it seems  
  
Was I just too blind to see  
That you'd given up on me  
And it's over now  
Your broken heart won't mend  
  
Just one more dance  
Why don't we try  
Holding each other  
While the world stands still  
  
You and I, were so much in love  
And I would give anything  
For the chance at romance  
Just one more dance  
  
Well I know I've been a fool  
And I know that I've been cruel  
When you give your love completely  
Heart and soul  
  
'Let it slipped right through my hands  
Can't you ever understand  
I've never felt this kind of love before  
  
Just one more dance  
Why don't we try  
Holding each other  
While the world stands still  
  
You and I, are so much in love  
And I would give anything  
For the chance at romance  
Just one more dance  
  
My love has no pride  
I'm dying inside  
I'm down on my knees  
I'm down on my knees  
For your love  
  
Just one more dance  
Why don't we try  
Holding each other  
While the world stands still  
  
You and I, are so much in love  
And I would give anything  
For the chance at romance  
Just one more dance  
  
Why don't we try  
For the chance at romance  
Just one more time  
  
Why don't we try  
For the chance at romance  
Just one more time

You are far  
When I could have been your star  
You listened to people  
Who scared you to death  
And from my heart  
Strange that you were strong enough  
To even make a start  
But you'll never find  
Peace of mind  
Till you listen to your heart  
  
People  
You can never change the way the feel  
Better let them do just what they will  
For they will  
If you let them  
Steal your heart from you  
People  
Will always make a lover feel a fool  
But you knew I loved you  
We could have shown them all  
We should have seen love through  
  
Fooled me with the tears in your eyes  
Covered me with kisses and lies  
So goodbye  
But please don't take my heart  
  
You are far  
I'm never gonna be your star  
I'll pick up the pieces  
And mend my heart  
Maybe I'll be strong enough  
I don't know where to start  
But I'll never find  
Peace of mind  
While I listen to my heart  
  
People  
You can never change the way the feel  
Better let them do just what they will  
For they will  
If you let them  
Steal your heart from you  
People  
Will always make a lover feel a fool  
But you knew I loved you  
We could have shown them all  
We should have seen love through  
  
But remember this  
Every other kiss  
That you'll ever give  
Long as we both live  
When you need the hand of another man  
One you really can surrender with  
I will wait for you  
Like I always do  
There's something there  
That can't compare with any other  
  
You are far  
When I could have been your star  
You listened to people  
Who scared you to death  
And from my heart  
Strange that I was wrong enough  
To think you'd love me too  
I guess you were kissing a fool  
You must have been kissing a fool

L is for the way you look at me  
O is for the only one I see  
V is very, very extraordinary  
E is even more than anyone that you adore  
  
And love is all that I can give to you  
Love is more than just a game for two  
Two in love can make it  
Take my heart but please don't break it  
Love was made for me and you  
  
L is for the way you look at me  
O is for the only one I see  
V is very, very extraordinary  
E is even more than anyone that you adore  
  
And love is all that I can give to you  
Love, love, love is more than just a game for two  
Two in love can make it  
Take my heart but please don't break it  
'Cause love was made for me and you  
I said love was made for me and you  
You know that love was made for me and you

Up a lazy river by the old mill run  
Lazy river in the noon day sun  
Linger in the shade of a tree  
Throw away your troubles, dream with me  
  
Up a lazy river where the robin's song  
Wakes that mornin', as we roll along  
Blue skies up above ....everyone's in love  
Up a lazy river, how happy we will be  
Up a lazy river with me  
  
Up a lazy river by that old mill run  
That lazy, hazy river in the noon day sun  
You can linger for a while in the shade of a tree  
Throw, away your troubles, baby, dream of me  
  
Up a lazy river where the robin's song  
Wakes that bright new mornin' as we roll along  
There may be blue skies up above  
But as long as we're in love  
Up a lazy river, how happy we could be  
If you go up a lazy river with me

The tables are empty  
The dance floor's deserted  
You play the same love song  
It's the tenth time you've heard it  
And that's the beginning  
Just one of those clues  
You've had your first lesson  
In learning the blues  
  
The cigarettes you light  
One after another  
Won't help you forget her  
Or the way that you love her  
You're only burning  
A torch you can't lose  
But you're on the right track  
For learning the blues  
  
When you're at home alone  
The blues will haunt you constantly  
When you're out in a crowd  
The blues will haunt your memory  
The nights when you don't sleep  
The whole night you're crying  
But you can't forget her  
Soon you'll stop trying  
You'll walk the floor  
And wear out your shoes  
When you're feeling your heart break  
You're learning the blues

I can't believe it's over  
I watched the whole thing fall  
And I never saw the writing that was on the wall  
If I only knew  
The days were slipping past  
That the good things never last  
That you were cryin'  
  
Summer turned to winter  
And the snow, it turned to rain  
Then the rain turned into tears upon your face  
I hardly recognize the girl you are today  
And God I hope it's not too late  
It's not too late  
  
Cuz you are not alone  
I'm always there with you  
And we'll get lost together  
Till the light comes pouring through  
When you feel like you're done  
And the darkness has won  
Babe you're not lost  
  
When your world's crashing down  
And you can't bear the thought  
I said babe you're not lost  
  
Life can show no mercy  
It can tear your soul apart  
It can make you feel like you've gone crazy  
But you're not  
Though things have seemed to change  
There's one thing that's still the same  
In my heart you have remained  
And we can fly, fly, fly away  
  
Cuz you are not alone  
I am there with you  
And we'll get lost together  
Till the light comes pouring through  
When you feel like you're done  
And the darkness has won  
Babe you're not lost  
  
When your worlds crashing down  
And you can't bear the thought  
I said baby you're not lost  
  
Mmmm yeah yeah, yeah yeah,  
I said baby you're not lost.  
I said baby you're not lost.  
Oh yeah, yeah  
I said baby you're not lost.

I'm making this one special evening  
Taking a chance in my life  
Hoping you feel the same way as I do tonight  
Just try and look into my eyes  
Don't be scared of what you might see there  
The first time I saw you  
I knew love at first sight must be true, so true, oh so true  
And now I just have to explain why I feel this way  
I feel joy, I feel pain  
You're in my heart and it's tearing me apart  
'Cause I love you, I love you, I love you!

Oh, the shark has pretty teeth, dear

Just a jackknife has MacHeath, babe  
And it keeps it way out of sight  
When that shark bites with his teeth, dear  
Scarlet billows begin to spread  
Fancy gloves, wears old MacHeath, babe  
So there's never, never a trace of red  
  
On the sidewalk, one Sunday mornin  
Lies a body oozin' life  
Someone's sneakin' round that corner  
Could that someone be Mack the Knife?  
  
Oh there's a tugboat down, down by the river dontcha know  
Where a cement bag's just a'drooppin' on down  
That cement's there, it's there for the weight, dear  
Five'll get ya ten old Macky's back in town

Oh, the line forms on the right, babe  
Now that Macky's back in town  
Look out, old Macky is back!

I'm gonna buy a Paper Doll that I can call my own  
A doll that other fellows cannot steal  
And then the flirty, flirty guys with their flirty, flirty eyes  
Will have to flirt with dollies that are real  
  
When I come home at night she will be waiting  
She'll be the truest doll in all this world  
I'd rather have a Paper Doll to call my own  
Than have a fickle-minded real live girl  
  
I guess I had a million dolls or more  
I guess I've played the doll game o'er and o'er  
I just quarrelled with Sue, that's why I'm blue  
She's gone away and left me just like all dolls do  
  
I'll tell you boy, it's tough to be alone  
And it's tough to love a gal that's not your own  
I'm through with all of them  
I'll never fall again  
Say boy, whatcha gonna do?

Grab a gal. You're gonna, gonna make her spin and swirl  
You jump and jive'n gonna make her twirl  
You're swingin' now!  
It's alright to wanna, wanna, wanna hold her tight  
You're dancin', dancin', dancin' throught the night  
You're swingin' now!  
Make your move, take a chance, just get on that floor and dance!  
Don't be cool, don't be slick, you just keep on swingin', keep on swingin'  
Keep on swingin' swing!  
Grab a guy. You tell him, tell him, tell him don't ask why,

You can dance-every dance with the guy  
Who gives you the eye,let him hold you tight  
You can smile-every smile for the man

So darling,save the last dance for me

Every street corner you'll hear, you can hear  
  
Silver bells, silver bells  
It's Christmas time in the city  
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring  
Soon it will be Christmas day  
  
City sidewalks, busy sidewalks dressed in holiday style  
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas  
Children laughing, people passing, meeting smile after smile  
And on every street corner you'll hear, you can hear  
  
Silver bells, silver bells, silver bells, silver bells  
It's Christmas time in the city  
Ring-a-ling, ring-a-ling, hear them sing, hear them sing  
Soon it will be Christmas day  
  
Strings of streetlights even stop lights blink a bright red and green  
As the shoppers rush home with their treasures  
Hear the snow crunch, see the kids rush, this is Santa's big scene  
And above all this bustle you'll hear, you can hear  
  
Silver bells, the corner Santa Claus, silver bells, is busy now because  
It's Christmas time in the city  
Ring-a-ling, you'll hear it in the air, hear them ring, you'll hear it  
Everywhere

Smile  
Though your heart is aching  
Smile  
Even though it's breaking  
  
When there are clouds  
In the sky,  
You'll get by  
If you smile  
  
Through your fear and sorrow  
Smile  
And maybe tomorrow  
You'll see the sun  
  
Come shining through  
For you  
  
Light up your face with gladness  
Hide every trace of sadness  
Although a tear  
May be ever so near  
  
That's the time  
You must keep on trying  
Smile  
What's the use of crying?  
  
You'll find that life  
Is still worth-while  
If you just smile  
Smile  
  
Light up your face with gladness  
Hide every trace of sadness  
Although a tear  
May be ever so near  
  
That's the time  
You must keep on trying  
Smile,  
What's the use of crying?  
  
You'll find that life  
Is still worth-while  
If you just smile  
Keep on smiling  
  
Oh yeah  
Smile  
Never, never, never stop smile

I know I stand in line, until you think you have the time  
To spend an evening with me  
And if we go someplace to dance, I know that there's a chance  
You won't be leaving with me  
  
And afterwards we drop into a quiet little place  
And have a drink or two  
And then I go and spoil it all,  
by saying something stupid like, I love you  
  
I can see it in your eyes, that you despise the same old lies  
You heard the night before  
And though it's just a line to you, for me it's true  
And never seemed so right before  
  
I practice every day to find some clever lines to say  
To make the meaning come through  
But then I think I'll wait until the evening gets late  
And I'm alone with you  
  
The time is right your perfume fills my head, the stars get red  
And oh the night's so blue  
And then I go and spoil it all, by saying something stupid  
Like, I love you  
  
The time is right your perfume fills my head, the stars get red  
And oh the night's so blue  
And then I go and spoil it all, by saying something stupid  
Like, I love you  
I love you, I love you  
I love you, I love you

The summer wind came blowin' in  
From across the sea  
It lingered there touched your hair  
And walked with me  
  
All summer long  
We sang a song  
And then we strolled on golden sand  
Two sweethearts  
And the summer wind  
  
Like painted kites, those days and nights  
Went flying by  
The world was new  
Beneath the bright blue  
Umbrella sky  
  
Then softer than  
A piper man  
One day, it called to you  
I lost you to  
The summer wind  
  
The autumn wind  
And the winter wind  
They have come and gone  
But still those days  
Those lonely days  
Go on and on  
And guess who sighs his lullabies  
Through nights that never end?  
My fickle friend,  
The summer wind  
  
Umm... That summer wind.  
Warm warm summer wind  
Umm... That summer wind.

When we kiss my heart's on fire  
Burning with a strange desire  
And I know, each time I kiss you  
That your heart's on fire too  
So, my darling, please surrender  
All your love so warm and tender  
Let me hold you in my arms, dear  
While the moon shines bright above  
All the stars will tell a story  
Of a love and all it's glory  
Let us take this night of magic  
And make it a night of love  
  
Won't you please surrender to me  
Your lips, your arms, your heart, dear  
Be mine forever  
Be mine tonight

When marimba rhythms start to play  
Dance with me, make me sway  
Like a lazy ocean hugs the shore  
Hold me close, sway me more  
  
Like a flower bending in the breeze  
Bend with me, sway with ease  
When we dance you have a way with me  
Stay with me, sway with me  
  
Other dancers may be on the floor  
Dear, but my eyes will see only you  
Only you have that magic technique  
When we sway I go weak  
  
I can hear the sounds of violins  
Long before it begins  
Make me thrill as only you know how  
Sway me smooth, sway me now

Love the one that's right  
Not the one you keep thinking of  
Open your eyes  
Take a look, let him in  
Don't let your life go by dreamin'  
'Bout some other guy when you are dancin'  
With him cheek to cheek  
  
Flying around in a jet  
Champagne and limos you bet!  
Laughing and having some fun  
Though he's not even the one  
  
Love the one that's right for love  
Not the one you keep thinking of  
Open your heart  
Take a chance, let him in  
Don't try to say that he's not  
'Cause of all the things that he's got  
  
For he's just a guy that wants you and he'll be true  
And although he just tries to explain  
That all of this fun's not a game  
He'll turn around and walk out that door  
Just tell him he's yours!

Out of the tree of life I just picked me a plum  
You came along and everything started to hum  
Still, it's a real good bet the best is yet to come  
  
The best is yet to come, and babe won't it be fine  
You think you've seen the sun, but you ain't seen it shine  
  
Wait till the warm-up's underway  
Wait till our lips have met  
Wait till you see that sunshine day  
You ain't seen nothin' yet  
  
The best is yet to come, and babe won't it be fine  
The best is yet to come, come the day you're mine  
  
The best is yet to come  
Come the day you're mine  
Oh, come the day you're mine  
I'm gonna teach you to fly  
We've only tasted the wine  
We're gonna drain that cup dry  
  
Wait till your charms are right, for the arms to surround  
You think you've flown before, but you ain't left the ground  
  
Wait till you're locked in my embrace  
Wait till I hold you near  
Wait till you see that sunshine place  
There ain't nothin' like it here  
  
The best is yet to come, and babe won't it be fine  
The best is yet to come, come the day you're mine  
Come the day you're mine  
I've got plans for you, baby  
And, baby, you're gonna fly

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire  
Jack Frost nipping at your nose  
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir  
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.  
  
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe  
Help to make the season bright  
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow  
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.  
  
They know that Santa's on his way  
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh  
And every mother's child is gonna spy  
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.  
  
And so I'm offering this simple phrase  
To kids from one to ninety-two  
Although it's been said many times, many ways  
Merry Christmas to you!

Some day, when I'm awfully low,  
When the world is cold,  
I will feel a glow just thinking of you  
And the way you look tonight.  
  
You're lovely, with your smile so warm  
And your cheeks so soft,  
There is nothing for me but to love you,  
And the way you look tonight.  
  
With each word your tenderness grows,  
Tearing my fears apart  
And that laugh that wrinkles your nose,  
Touches my foolish heart.  
  
Yes you're lovely, never, ever change  
Keep that breathless charm.  
Won't you please arrange it?  
'Cause I love you  
Just the way you look tonight.  
  
With each word your tenderness grows,  
Tearing my fears apart  
And that laugh that wrinkles your nose,  
Touches my foolish heart.  
  
Yes you're lovely, never, ever change  
Keep that breathless charm.  
Won't you please arrange it?  
'Cause I love you  
Just the way you look tonight.  
Just the way you look tonight.  
Darling  
Just the way you look tonight.

Till then, my darling please wait for me  
Till then, no matter when it will be  
One day I know I'll be back again  
Please wait till then  
  
Our dreams will live though we are apart  
Our love -- I know we'll keep in our heart  
Till then, when all the world will be free  
Please wait for me  
  
Although there are oceans we must cross  
And mountains that we must climb  
I know every gain must have a loss  
So pray that our loss is nothing but time  
  
Till then, let's dream of what there will be  
Till then, we'll call on each memory  
Till then, when I will hold you again  
Please wait till then

Someone to care  
Someone to share  
Lonely hours and moments of despair  
To be loved, to be loved  
Oh what a feeling to be loved  
  
Someone to kiss  
Someone to miss  
When you're away  
To here from each day

But to be, truly, truly, truly loved

Someone to kiss  
Someone to miss  
When you're away to here from each day  
To be loved, to be love

But to feel truly love baby

Someone to miss  
someone to kiss  
When you're away to here from each day  
To be loved, To be loved  
Oh what a feeling  
To be loved To be loved  
To be loved To be loved  
Oh what a feeling  
To be loved

There's a light  
A certain kind of light  
That never shone on me  
I want my life to be lived with you  
Lived with you  
  
There's a way,(there's a way) everybody say  
To do each and every little thing  
But what does it bring  
If I ain't got you, (If I ain't got you)  
If I ain't got you, (If I ain't got you)  
  
Baby, you don't know what it's like

To love somebody

The way I love you  
  
In my brain  
I see your face again  
I know my frame of mind  
You ain't got to be so blind  
And I'm blind, yeah I'm blind  
  
I'm a man  
Can't you see what I am?  
I live and breathe for you  
But what good does it do  
If I ain't got you, (If I ain't got you)  
If I ain't got you, (If I ain't got you)  
  
Baby, you don't know what it's like  
Baby, you don't know what it's like  
To love somebody

Be wise, be smart, behave, my heart  
Don't upset your cart when she's so close  
Be soft, be sweet but be discreet  
Don't go off your beat  
  
She's too close for comfort  
Too close, too close for comfort  
Please not again  
Too close, too close  
To know just when to say when  
  
Be firm, be fair, be sure, beware  
On your guard, take care  
While there's such temptation  
  
One thing leads to another  
Too late to run for cover  
She's much too close for comfort now  
  
Too close, too close for comfort  
Please not again  
Too close, too close  
To know just when to say when  
  
Be firm, be fair, be sure, beware  
On your guard, take care  
When there's such temptation  
  
One thing leads to another  
Too late to run for cover  
She's much too close for comfort now  
  
One thing leads to another  
Too late to run for cover  
She's much too close for comfort now  
She's too close, way too close  
She's too close for comfort now

I may get weary  
Women do get weary  
Wearing the same shabby dress  
But to one who's weary  
Try a little tenderness  
  
She may be waiting  
Just anticipating  
All of the things  
She may never possess  
But while she's waiting  
Try a little tenderness  
  
I may be sentimental  
But I've had my griefs  
And my cares  
And just a good word  
Soft and gentle  
Makes it, makes it  
So much easier to bear  
  
She might forget it  
Oh but don't let her forget it  
Love's got a whole  
A whole happiness  
'cause it's so easy  
Try a little tenderness  
  
Oh it's so very easy  
It's so very easy  
Try a little  
Try a little  
Try a little  
Try a little  
Try a little  
  
Try a little, try a little  
Won't you  
'cause it's so very easy  
So very easy  
Won't you try  
Yes, I'll try  
Try a little tender -  
Tender -  
-ness  
I'll try a little tenderness

Here we are  
On earth together  
It's you and I  
God has made us fall in love  
It's true  
I've really found  
Someone like you  
Will it say  
The love you feel for me  
Will it say  
That you will be by my side  
To see me through  
Until my life is through  
Will in my mind  
We can conquer the world  
In love you and I  
You and I, you and I...  
I'm glad  
At least in my life  
I've found someone  
That may not be here forever  
To see me through  
But I found my strength in you  
Cause in my mind  
You will stay here always  
In love you and I  
You and I, you and I  
You and I, you and I  
You and I  
In my mind  
We can conquer the world  
In love you and I  
You and I, you and I  
You and I...

See the pyramids along the Nile  
See the sunrise on a tropic isle  
Just remember darlin' all the while  
You belong to me  
  
See the market place in Old Algiers  
Send me photographs and souvenirs  
Just remember when a dream appears  
You belong to me  
  
I'll be so alone without you  
Maybe you'll be lonesome too, and blue  
  
Fly the ocean in a silver plane  
See the jungle when it's wet with rain  
Just remember 'til you're home again  
You belong to me  
  
Fly the ocean in a silver plane  
See the jungle when it's wet with rain  
Just remember 'til you're home again  
You belong to me

You give your hand to me  
Then you say hello  
I can hardly speak  
My heart is beating so  
And anyone can tell  
You think you know me well  
But you don't know me  
  
No, you don't know the one  
Who dreams of you at night  
And longs to kiss your lips  
And longs to hold you tight  
Oh I'm just a friend  
That's all I've ever been  
'Cause you don't know me  
  
I never knew  
The art of making love  
Though my heart aches  
With love for you  
Afraid and shy  
I've let my chance to go by  
The chance that you might  
Love me, too  
  
You give your hand to me  
And then you say good-bye  
I watch you walk away  
Beside the lucky guy  
You'll never never know  
The one who loves you so  
Well, you don't know me  
  
You give your hand to me, baby  
Then you say good-bye  
I watch you walk away  
Beside the lucky guy  
No, no, you'll never ever know  
The one who loves you so  
Well, you don't know me

You make me feel so young  
You make me feel as though spring has sprung  
And every time I see you grin  
I'm such a happy individual  
  
The moment that you speak  
I wanna go play hide and seek  
I wanna go and bounce the moon  
Just like a toy balloon  
  
You and I are just like a couple of tots  
Runnin' across the meadow  
Pickin' up lots of forget me nots  
  
You make me feel so young  
You make me feel there are songs to be sung Bells to be rung  
And a wonderful spring to be sprung  
And even when I'm old and grey  
I'm gonna feel the way I do, today  
'Cause you make me feel so young  
  
You make me young  
You make me feel as though spring has sprung  
And every time I see you grin  
I'm such a happy individual  
  
The moment that you speak  
I wanna go play hide and seek  
I wanna go and bounce at the moon  
Like a big balloon  
  
Because, you and I are just like a couple of tots  
Runnin' across the meadow  
Grabbing up all  
  
You make me up  
You make me feel there are songs to be sung  
Lots of bells to be rung  
And a wonderful fling to be flung  
And even when I'm old and gray  
I'm gonna feel the way i do today  
Cause you make me feel so  
Man i just feel so  
You make me feel so young  
You make me feel so young  
So young  
You make me feel so young  
You make me feel so young

You'll never find, as long as you live  
Someone who loves you tender like I do  
You'll never find, no matter where you search  
Someone who cares about you the way I do  
  
Whoa, I'm not braggin' on myself, baby  
But I'm the one who loves you  
And there's no one else! No one else!  
  
You'll never find, it'll take the end of all time  
Someone to understand you like I do  
You'll never find the rhythm, the rhyme  
All the magic we shared, just us two  
  
Whoa, I'm not tryin' to make you stay, baby  
But I know some how, some day, some way  
You are (you're gonna miss my lovin')  
You're gonna miss my lovin' (you're gonna miss my lovin')  
You're gonna miss my lovin' (you're gonna miss my lovin')  
You're gonna miss, you're gonna miss my lo-o-ove  
  
Late in the midnight hour, baby (you're gonna miss my lovin')  
When it's cold outside (you're gonna miss my lovin')  
You're gonna miss, you're gonna miss my lo-o-ove  
  
You'll never find another love like mine  
Someone who needs you like I do  
You'll never see what you've found in me  
You'll keep searching and searching your whole life through  
  
Whoa, I don't wish you no bad luck, baby  
But there's no ifs and buts or maybes  
  
(You're gonna) You're gonna miss (miss my lovin')  
You're gonna miss my lovin' (you're gonna miss my lovin')  
I know you're gonna my lovin' (you're gonna miss my lovin')  
You're gonna miss, you're gonna miss my lo-o-ove  
  
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh (you're gonna miss my lovin')  
Late in the midnight hour, baby (you're gonna miss my lovin')  
When it gets real cold outside (you're gonna miss my lovin')  
I know, I know that you are gonna miss my lo-o-ove  
  
Let me tell you that you're gonna miss my lovin'  
Yes you will, baby (you're gonna miss my lovin')  
When I'm long gone  
  
I know, I know, I know that you are gonna miss

You'll never know just how much I love you,  
You'll never know just how much I care.  
And if I tried  
I still couldn't hide  
My love for you  
You ought to know  
For haven't I told you so  
A million or more times?  
  
You went away and my heart went with you  
I speak your name in my every prayer  
If there is some other way  
To prove that I love you  
I swear I don't know how  
You'll never know if you don't know now.

Fairy tales can come true  
It can happen to you when you're young at heart  
For it's hard, you will find  
To be narrow of mind if you're young at heart  
  
You can go to extremes with impossible schemes  
You can laugh when your dreams fall apart at the seams  
And life gets more exciting with each passing day  
And love is either in your heart or on it's way  
  
Don't you know that it's worth  
Every treasure on earth to be young at heart  
For as rich as you are  
It's much better by far to be young at heart  
  
And if you should survive to a hundred and five  
Look at all you'll derive out of being alive  
And here is the best part, you have a head start  
If you are among the very young at heart  
  
And if you should survive to a hundred and five  
Look at all you'll derive out of being alive  
And here is the best part, you have a head start  
If you are among the very young at heart

You're nobody 'til somebody loves you  
You're nobody 'til somebody cares  
You may be king, you may possess the world and it's gold  
But gold won't bring you happiness when you're growing old  
  
The world still is the same, you'll never change it  
As sure as the star shines above  
You're nobody 'til somebody loves you  
So find yourself somebody to love  
  
The world still is the same, you'll never change it  
As sure as the star shines above  
You're nobody 'til somebody loves you  
So find yourself somebody to love  
So find yourself somebody to love

You've got a friend in me  
You've got a friend in me  
When the road looks rough ahead  
And you're miles and miles from your nice warm bed  
You just remember what your old pal said  
Yeah you've got a friend in me  
Baby you've got a friend in me  
  
You've got a pal in me  
You've got a friend in me  
You got your troubles and I got 'em too  
There isn't anything I wouldn't do for you  
We stick together, and see it through  
'Cause you've got a friend in me  
Darling you got a friend in me  
  
Now, some other boys might be little bit smarter than I am  
Are bigger and stronger too  
Maybe, But none of them  
Is ever gonna love you the way I do  
It's me and you  
  
And as the years go by  
Our friendship will never die  
You're gonna see it's our destiny  
You've got a friend in me  
You've got a friend in me
