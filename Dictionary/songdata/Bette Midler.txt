We skipped the light fandango  
And turned cartwheels across the floor  
I was feeling kind of seasick  
The crowd called out for more  
The room was humming harder  
As the ceiling flew away  
When we called out for another drink  
The waiter brought a tray  
  
And so it was that later  
As the miller told his tale  
That her face at first just ghostly  
Turned a whiter shade of pale  
  
She said there is no reason  
And the truth is plain to see  
But I wandered through my playing cards  
Would not let her be  
One of sixteen vestal virgins  
Who were leaving for the coast  
At the moment my eyes were open  
They might just as well have been closed  
  
And so it was that later  
As the miller told his tale  
That her face at first just ghostly  
Turned a whiter shade of pale

Oh, show me the way to the next whiskey bar.  
Oh, don't ask why. Oh, don't ask why.  
'Cause I must find the next whiskey bar.  
If I don't find the next whiskey bar,  
I tell you I will die, I tell you I will die.  
I tell you, I tell you, I tell you I will die.  
  
Oh, moon of Alabama, so high up in the sky.  
I lost him, I lost my lover.  
I need a drink. Can you guess why?  
  
Oh, moon of Alabama, so high up in the sky.  
I lost him, I lost my lover.  
I need a drink, and you know why.  
I bet you know why. I bet you know why.

I pretend I'm at home getting dressed for a date  
I take a comb, comb my hair  
Take a flower, smell it and put it in my lapel  
And I spot the audience  
Once my clothes were shabby  
Tailors called me Cabbie  
So I took a vow, said this bum'll be Beau Brummel  
Now I'm smooth and snappy, now my tailor's happy  
I am the cats meow, my wardrobe is a wow  
Paris silk, Harris tweed, there's only one thing I need  
Got my tweed pressed, got my best vest  
All I need now is the girl  
Got my striped tie, got my hopes high  
Got the time and the place and I got rhythm  
Now all I need is the girl to go with 'em  
If she'll just appear we'll take this big town for a whirl  
And if she?ll say my darling I'm yours  
I'll throw away my striped tie and my best pressed tweed  
All I really need is the girl  
I start off easy, you see?  
Now I'm more debonair, ssh, break  
And I sell it here, I start this step, see?  
And then I build it, double it  
She appears all in white, I take her hand, kiss it  
And lead her on the floor  
This step's good for the costume, Astaire's pat  
Yah, dah, dah, dah, yah, dah, yah, dah, dah, yah  
Now we waltz, strings come in  
And I lift her again, once more  
And now the tempo changes and all the lights come up  
And I build for the finale  
Louise that's it, do it over here  
Follow me, faster, Charleston  
Again, do it again, give me your hands  

All of a sudden all the past was behind me.  
All of a sudden nothing stood to remind me.  
All of a piece I am awake and I can say.  
  
All of a sudden I am finding religion.  
All of a sudden all my sins are forgiven.  
Now all at once it is down to you and me.  
  
I see light over there at the end of the tunnel and  
I don't mind if it takes a little more time.  
Come over here, don't take your hand away.  
Come over here, take my breath away.  
Now is the time to say what you want to say.  
(It's not a dream, this is really happening.)  
  
All of a sudden, now baby, it's love.  
All of a little just isn't enough.  
All of a sudden, now baby, it's real.  
All of the riddle comes perfectly clear.  
  
All in a moment I was brought through the darkness.  
All in one motion like the sun through the forest.  
Oh, by the grace I am alive and I will live.  
  
All of a sudden I am cleared of confusion.  
All of my happiness is real, not illusion.  
So many years I had to seek so I could find.  
  
I see light over there at the end of the tunnel and  
I don't mind if it takes a little more time.  
Come over here, don't take your hand away.  
Come over here, take my breath away.  
Now is the time to say what you want to say.  
(It's not a dream, this is really happening.)  
  
All of a sudden, now baby, it's love.  
All of a little just isn't enough.  
All of a sudden, now baby, it's real.  
All of the riddle comes perfectly clear.  
  
Come over here, don't take your hand away.  
Come over here, and take my breath away.  
Now is the time to say what you want to say.  
(It's not a dream, this is really happening.)  
  
All of a sudden, now baby, it's love.  
All of a little just isn't enough.  
All of a sudden. now baby, it's real.  
All of the riddle comes perfectly clear.  
  
All of a sudden, now baby, it's true.  
All of a sudden I believe in you.  
All of a sudden I'm fooling around.  
All of a sudden I know what I found.  
I know what I found.  
I know what I found.  
I know what I found.

Well alright, okay, you win  
I'm in love with you  
Well alright, okay, you win  
Baby, what can I do?  
I'll do anything you say  
It's just got to be that way  
Well alright, okay, you win  
I'm in love with you  
Well alright, okay, you win  
Baby, what can I do?  
Anything you say, I'll do  
As long as it's me and you  
All that I am askin'  
All I want from you  
Is just love me like I love you  
And it won't be hard to do  
Well alright, okay, you win  
I'm in love with you  
Well alright, okay, you win  
Well, baby, what can I do?  
I'll do anything you say  
Oh, it's just got to be that way  
All that I am askin'  
All I want from you  
Just love me like I love you  
It won't be hard to do  
All night, all day  
I'm in, ooh, and I'm telling you  
Alright, okay, you win  
What are you waiting for?  
If you're gonna be my man  
Sweet baby, take me by the hand  
Well alright, okay, you win  

I'm just a woman, a lonely woman,  
waiting on the weary shore.  
I'm just a woman who's only human,  
one you should feel sorry for.  
Well, I woke up this morning a long about dawn.  
Without a warning I found that he was gone.  
Why did he do it? How could he do it?  
He'd never done it before.  
Am I blue. Am I blue.  
Ain't these tears in these eyes tellin' you?  
Oh, am I blue? Well, I bet you would be, too,  
if each plan with your man done fell through.  
There was a time I was his only one.  
but now I'm the sad and lonely one.  
Was I gay 'til today?  
But now that man is gone,  
he's gone and we are through.  
Am I blue.  
There was a time I was his only one.  
But now, a, now, now, now, I'm the sad and lonely one.  
Oh god, I'm lonely.  
But I remember, oh, I remember when I was gay.  
That was up until today,  
'cause now that man is gone, he's gone and we are through.  
Am I, am I, well, would you believe it if I told you I'm blue?

When the white bird flies  
From your heart to mine  
I surrender every part of me  
To the tenderness  
  
Could it be the wine  
In your eyes stars shine  
And I'm feeling like a child again  
Oh, it's taken me a little time  
To find words to say  
  
[Chorus:]  
Stay  
Make this forever  
And lay love in my life  
Come what may  
Cherish each moment of love  
As dreams go by  
  
If the first glow fades  
From the love we've made  
I will hold you closer  
In the night  
Under heart and key  
  
When there are hills to climb  
And your world won't rhyme  
I will fight until I get it right  
'Cause you're part of me  
The heart of me  
Only if you'll stay  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The trees and the towers are burning  
Fear walks on the sea  
My soul in the wasteland is yearning  
What does tomorrow hold for me  
  
What can I say  
Just that I need you  
With you here by my side  
We can turn even the desert  
Evergreen, as dreams go by

Bette: I really can't stay  
James: But baby, it's cold outside.  
B: I got to go 'way.  
J: But baby, it's cold outside.  
B: This evening has been  
J: Been hopin' that you'd drop in.  
B: so very nice.  
J: I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice.  
B: My mother will start to worry.  
J: Beautiful, what's your hurry?  
B: My father will be pacing the floor.  
J: Listen to that fireplace roar.  
B: So really I'd better scurry.  
J: Beautiful, please don't hurry.  
B: Well, maybe just a half a drink more.  
J: Put some records on while I pour.  
B: You know the neighbors might think.  
J: But baby, it's bad out there.  
B: Er, what's in this drink?  
J: No cabs to be had out there.  
B: I wish I knew how  
J: Your eyes are like starlight now.  
B: to break this spell.  
J: I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell.  
B: I ought to say no, no, no sir.  
J: Mind if I move in closer?  
B: At least I'm gonna say that I tried.  
J: What's the sense in hurtin' my pride?  
B: I really can't stay,  
J: Baby, don't hold out.  
B: ah, but it's cold outside.  
J: Baby, it's cold outside.  
B: Ah, but it's cold outside.  
J: Baby, it's cold outside.

Baby mine, don't you cry.  
Baby mine, dry your eyes.  
Rest your head close to my heart,  
never to part, baby of mine.  
  
Little one, when you play,  
pay no heed what they say.  
Let your eyes sparkle and shine,  
never a tear, baby of mine.  
  
If they knew all about you,  
they'd end up loving you, too.  
All those same people who scold you,  
what they'd give just for the right to hold you.  
  
From your hair down to your toes,  
you're not much, goodness knows.  
But, you're so precious to me,  
sweet as can be, baby of mine.

"Oh god, oh god. Dumping so early in the evening. I really didn't mean that. I
really didn't mean that."  
  
Above the ground, I'm lifted to the sky,  
And down like a tumbling weed I found myself stranded high and dry.  
A circus ride, oh, it only costs a dime,  
But if you wanna see the fireworks you might have to pay a lifetime.  
  
'Cause love is a carnival  
With lots of laughs, wonderful rides and danger.  
But it feels so good.  
With rockets shootin' in your head,  
'round and 'round and 'round you go.  
Bang, you're dead, baby. Bang, you're dead, baby.  
  
Like a boomerang keeps twisting, twisting in your heart.  
You know the funny part of it is, you always end up where you start.  
You're headed for big clouds. Got the silver lining.  
But you're in for a big surprise.  
There's a river of tears behind it.  
  
'Cause love is a carnival  
With lots of baubles, bangles and beads.  
Beware, beware, beware.  
It feels so good, feels so good.  
With rockets shootin' in your head,  
'round and 'round and 'round you go.  
Bang, you're dead, baby. Bang, you're dead, baby.  
  
Above the ground I'm lifted. Spininng, spinning, spinning out of control.  
Higher, higher, higher, higher, higher!  
Above the ground I'm lifted, yeah, to the sky.  
And down like a tumbling weed I found myself stranded high and dry.  
A circus ride, you know it, it only costs a dime,  
But if you wanna see the fireworks you might have to pay.  
Hey, yeah, yeah, to the sky, high. And down like a tumbling weed  
I found myself stranded, stranded.  
Bang, you're dead!

Now write this down  
  
I'll never be your beast of burden  
My back is broad but it's a hurting  
All I want is for you to make love to me  
  
I'll never be your beast of burden  
I've walked for miles my feet are hurting  
All I want is you to make love to me  
  
Ain't I hard enough  
Ain't I rough enough  
Ain't I rich enough  
I'm not too blind to see  
  
I'll never be your beast of burden  
So let's go home and draw the curtains  
Put some music on the radio  
Come on baby make sweet love to me (Oh what's a matter with me?)  
  
Ain't I hard enough  
Ain't I rough enough  
Ain't I rich enough  
I'm not too blind to see  
  
Oh oh my little sister  
Is a pretty, pretty, girl  
My little sister is a pretty, pretty, girl  
She love to ride, and she loves to crawl  
They love to take her out, behind the wall  
  
And when their done, they just throw her away  
And she don't have an awful lot to say  
It hurts her so bad to come to the end  
I re, I remember all the times she spent sayin', "Please!"  
  
Ain't I hot enough?  
Ain't I rough enough?  
Ain't I rich enough?  
I'm not too blind to see, oh oh  
Oh, oh  
  
I'll never be your beast of burden.  
My back is broad, baby, but it's a' hurtin'.  
And all I want is you to make love to me.  
  
What's the matter, what's the matter with me?  
Ain't I hot enough?  
Ooh, yeah, ain't I rough enough?  
Ooh, yeah, ain't I rich enough, rich enough, rich enough,  
Too blind to see? Too blind, too blind, oh!  
  
I'll never be your beast of burden.  
I walk for miles, honey, my feet are hurtin'.  
And all I want

You talk about you and only you and the things that you do for you  
You say you're not a lean cuisine  
So I wanna see whatcha got on the menu  
Now if you think you're the man the only man  
With an exterior you feel issuperior Just give Miss be a little peek  
And see if you really can deliver  
Your tendencies are short, my expectations are long  
And as I see it now, there's not much to go on  
It seems you dug a hole that you can't crawl out  
Now I truly see what you're all about  
Chorus:  
Don't brag about the diamond rings  
Or the expensive clothes you wear  
'Cause I could care less for what you possess  
And your attitude needs repair  
Don't brag about your body baby  
And say that you're packin' a lot  
'Cause all I see besides your big feet  
Is that you got big socks  
Let's just say that there's something lacking  
A flea shouldn't have the nerve to be bragging  
So pack up your little gift and get up to steppin'  
Return it back and put it in the kiddie section  
Full figured in a place that can deliver?  
Ha ha not from what I've seen  
I can't trace what's below your waist  
There's too much space to be inside those jeans  
Chorus  
(Big socks, big socks  
I've got big socks, baby  
Big socks, big socks  
I've got big socks, baby  
Big socks, big socks  
I-I-I've got big socks, baby  
Big socks, big socks  
I-I-I-I-I)  
Bye bye baby bye bye  
It's time to wave the white flag  
Now the kitten has been let out of the bag  
Chorus  
Chorus

He was a famous trumpet man from out Chicago way  
He had a boogie style that no one else could play  
He was the top man at his craft  
But then his number came up, and he was gone with the draft  
He's in the army now, a-blowin' reveille  
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B  
  
They made him blow a bugle for his Uncle Sam  
It really brought him down because he couldn't jam  
The captain seemed to understand  
Because the next day the cap' went out and drafted a band  
And now the company jumps when he plays reveille  
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B  
  
A-toot, a-toot, a-toot-diddleyada-toot  
He blows it eight-to-the-bar, in boogie rhythm  
He can't blow a note unless the bass and guitar is playin' with him  
He makes the company jump when he plays reveille  
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B  
  
He was our boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B  
And when he plays boogie woogie bugle, he was buzy as a 'bzz' bee  
And when he plays, he makes the company jump eight-to-the-bar  
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B  
  
Toot-toot-toot, toot-diddleyada, toot-diddleyada  
Toot, toot, he blows it eight-to-the-bar  
He can't blow a note if the bass and guitar isn't with him  
A-a-a-and the company jumps when he plays reveille  
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B  
  
He puts the boys asleep with boogie every night  
And wakes 'em up the same way in the early bright  
They clap their hands and stamp their feet  
Because they know how he plays when someone gives him a beat  
He really breaks it up when he plays reveille  
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B  
  
Da-doo-da, da-doo-da-da, da  
Da-doo-da, da-doo-da-da, da  
Da-doo-da, da-doo-da-da, da  
Da-doo-da, da-doo-da-da  
A-a-a-and the company jumps when he plays reveille  
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B!

I got a funny feelin' that all of you girls  
Had better hold on to your man.  
'Cause I feel, I says I feel,  
I feeeeel like breaking up somebody's home.  
  
See, lying here all alone  
On a rainy night like this.  
Starvin' for some lovin'.  
Oh-oh, what I would give,  
What I would give for just one kiss.  
Every rain drop I hear  
Against my window pane.  
And it's beatin' through  
So loud and clear.  
Words, words that speak your name.  
  
See I, I got no where to turn  
Now that you have gone,  
And I feel like  
Breaking up somebody's home.  
  
I know it's useless  
Hangin' on when you belong to someone else.  
But I can't shake the feelin'.  
Oh, after all, I didn't make this bed.  
I got nowhere to turn  
Na, na, na, now, na, now, now that you have gone.  
  
I saw the boy last night  
And I believe I caught a chill.  
Well, I could, I could not control the vibration,  
And my heart, my heart,  
My heart justa would not stand still.  
I got nowhere to turn  
A now, now, now, now that you have gone,  
And I feel like  
Breaking up somebody's home.  
Got nowhere, a nowhere to run  
And I'm so damn tired of being all alone,  
And I feel like  
Breaking up somebody's home.  
  
I know it's useless  
Hangin' on when you, you, you, ya,  
You belong to someone else.  
But I, la, la, la, can't shake the feeling,  
Oh, after all, I didn't want it this way.  
I swear I did not want it this way.  
But I got nowhere, a no where to run,  
And I'm so g-ddamned tired of being alone,  
And I feel like breaking up somebody's home.  
Got nowhere, a nowhere to run,  
And I'm so g-ddamned tired of being alone,  
And I, I feel like, feel like,  
Breaking up some mutha's home.  
One more time.  
I, I got nowhere to turn,  
A nowhere to, nowhere to, nowhere to turn,  
And I feel like, I feel like,  
Breaking, breaking up somebosy's home.  
I gotta break up somebody's home.

Ohh oh, ohh oh, ah  
Sing to me baby, baby  
Buckets, nuggets of rain  
Nuggets of rain, nuggets of tears  
Got all the nuggets comin' out of my ears  
Nuggets of moonbeams in my hand  
You got all the love, honey baby, I can stand  
I been down, high like an oak  
I've seen pretty people disappear like smoke  
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear  
You want me, honey baby, I'll be here  
Ohh, I'll be here  
Ooh  
Sing to me baby, baby, baby  
Buckets of rain  
I like your smile and your fingertips  
I like the way that you move your lips  
I like that heavenly way you look at me  
Everything about you is bringing me ecstasy  
Little red wagon, little red bike  
I ain't no monkey but I know what I like  
I like the way you monkey around  
Stick with me baby and we'll never be found  
Life is heavy and life is sad  
Life is a bust when you think you've been had  
Your live, you must do and you do it bad  
I do it for you, honey baby, ain't you glad?  
Ohh oh, ohh, ooh  
Bobby, Bobby  
Hey there Mister D  
You set me free, yeah  
I don't believe I really said that  
Hum, meany  
Ooh, you don't even know, you have no idea  
I don't want to know  
You and Paul Simon should have done this one  

I held you close to me  
Once in a distant dream,  
Far from the shores of my fear.  
I sailed on the ocean where  
All I imagined could happen,  
And now you are here.  
  
It's so hard to touch  
What is out of our hands,  
To know and to trust  
What the heart understands.  
  
Only the ones who believe  
Ever see what they dream,  
Ever dream what comes true.  
  
Life gives us magic and  
Life brings us tragedy.  
Everyone suffers some loss.  
Still we have faith in it,  
Childlike hope.  
There's a reason that outweighs the cost.  
  
And gravity throws  
All these rules in our way.  
And sometimes the sprit  
Refuses to play.  
  
Only the ones who believe  
Ever see what they dream,  
Ever dream what comes true.  
  
And oh, love,  
Turn me around in your arms.  
And in this dream we share  
Let us not miss one kiss.  
  
And add my regrets  
To the tears in the rain  
For that's what the color  
Of roses contain.  
  
Only the ones who believe  
Ever see what they dream,  
Ever dream,  
Ever dream what comes true.

[Eddie:] "Hey, Sarge . . .  
Sing him a song, honey. He's earned it! Ha ha!"  
  
I'm gonna love you like nobody's loved you,  
Come rain or come shine.  
High as a mountain, deep as a river,  
Come rain or come shine.  
  
And I guess when you met me  
It was just one of those things.  
But don't ever bet me,  
'cause I'm gonna be true if you let me, let me.  
  
You're always gonna love me like nobody's loved me,  
Come rain or come shine.  
Happy together, unhappy together,  
And won't it be fine?  
  
Days may be cloudy or sunny.  
We're in or we're out of the money.  
But I'm with you always.  
I'm with you rain or shine.  
  
Days may be cloudy or sunny.  
We're in or we're out of the money.  
But I'm with you always.  
I'm with you rain or shine.  
Rain or shine.

To give the gonest of the boys and girls

I fell head over heels in Tucson,  
'Til the neon lights shined on his wedding band.  
And once a handsome Cherokee,  
He nearly swept me off my feet,  
And we danced the night away in old Cheyenne.  
  
Yeah, but something in my heart  
Says I'll know him in the dark  
When, at last, he comes along.  
  
Wee-ooo, wee-dle, e-de-oh.  
I see him ridin' through my dreams.  
Wee-whoo, wee-dle, e-de-oh.  
We're ridin' double as he sings.  
Wee-whoo, wee-dle, e-de-oh.  
It's a sagebrush moonlight scene.  
Wee-whoo, he's the answer to a cowgirl's dream.  
  
Yo doo lay ee yo doo lay ee ee-he  
Yo doo lay ee yo doo lay ee ee-he  
Yo doo lay ee yo doo lay ee  
Yo doo lay ee yo doo lay ee-he-e-e-e

Ah deedle lo doo lay ee yo doo lay ee ee-he  
Yo doo lay ee yo doo lay ee  
Yo doo lay ee yo doo lay ee-he  
  
Wee-whoo wee-dle e-de-oh  
I see him ridin' through my dreams.  
Wee-whoo wee-dle e-de-oh  
We're ridin' double as he sings.  
Wee-ee-ee ooo-oo-oo wee-dle e-de-oh  
It's a sagebrush moonlight scene.  
Wee-ooo, he's the answer to a cowgirl's dreams.

Hello, everybody!

A new cow,

Louise  
Moo, moo,

She likes to moo in  
The moonlight  
When the moody moon  
Appears  
And when she moos in  
The moonlight  
Gosh, it's moosic  
To my ears  
She's so moosical  
She loves a man cow,  
A tan cow

Loves me more

[music ends]

She was forty-one and her daddy still called her baby.  
Everyone in Brownsville thinks she's crazy,  
'cause she walks to the station with a suitcase in her hand.  
And she's looking for a mysterious dark-haired man.  
  
In her younger days they called her Delta Dawn.  
Prettiest woman you ever laid eyes on.  
But a man of low degree stood by her side,  
And he promised he would take her for his bride.  
  
Delta Dawn, what's that flower you have on?  
Could it be a faded rose from days gone by?  
Did I hear you say he was meeting you here today  
To take you to his mansion in the sky?  
  
Delta Dawn, what's that flower you got on?  
Could it be a faded rose from days gone by?  
Did I hear you say he was meeting you here today  
To take you to his mansion in the sky?  
  
Delta Dawn, what's that flower you got on?  
Could it be a faded rose from days gone by?  
Did I hear you say he was meeting you right here today?  
He's gonna take you to his mansion in the sky.  
  
Delta Dawn, oh, what is that flower that you've got on?  
Could it be, could it be just a faded rose from one of those days gone by?  
Well, did I her you say  
That he was gonna meet you right here, right here today?  
He's gonna take you to his mansion in the sky.  
To take you to his mansion in the sky.  
  
He's gonna take you, he's gonna take you.  
Oh, he's gonna take you and you and you and you.  
Oh, gonna take you, take you to that mansion.  
He's got to, gonna take you to that mansion.  
He's gonna take you and you and you and you,  
Oh, you and you and you.  
Take you to his mansion in the sky.  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!  
Gonna take you. Oh, oh.  
He's gonna take you, gonna take you,  
He's gonna, he's gonna take you to that mansion,  
He's gonna take you and you and you, oh . . .

Do you wanna dance, and hold my hand?  
Tell me you're my lover man.  
Oh baby, do you wanna dance?  
  
We could dance under the moonlight,  
Hug and kiss all through the night.  
Oh baby, tell me, do you wanna dance with me baby?  
  
Do you, do you, do you, do you want to dance?  
Do you, do you, do you want to dance?  
Do you, do you, do you, do you want to dance with me baby?  
  
Ah, that's right, ah, ah, aaaaaaaah.  
Do you want to dance under the moonlight?  
Hug me, kiss me, baby, all through the night.  
Oh baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, tell me, do you want to dance?  
  
Oh, do you, do you, do you, do you want to dance?  
Do you want to dance?  
Do you, do you, do you, do you want to dance with me baby?  
You got to dance with me baby.  
Please dance with me baby

Now I lay me down to sleep  
I pray the Lord my soul to keep  
Angels on my left and right  
To keep me safe all through the night  
There's a place way up high  
Starry bright there, through the night there  
Close your eyes, let your wishes fly  
You'll be in Dreamland by and by  
Dimpled and drowsy, off you go  
Over the treetops, sliding down a rainbow  
Sleepyhead, curl up in your bed  
And 'til the sun says, "Rise and shine"  
Sleep warm in Dreamland, baby mine  
There's a place worlds away  
Time has wings there, green with springs there  
Smiles and songs bloom on every tree  
Only in Dreamland, just wait and see  
Deep down inside us, a child's still there  
Wishing for Dreamland, knowing that it's somewhere  
Though it may seem so far away  
If you believe that dreams come true  
You'll find a Dreamland waiting for you  
Mmm, go to sleep now, dear  

Drinkin' again.  
Thinking of when you loved me.  
Having a few.  
Wishing that you were here.  
  
Making the rounds.  
Buying a round for total strangers.  
Just being a fool,  
'cause I keep hoping, hoping, hoping you'll appear.  
  
Sure I can borrow a smoke.  
I can sit here all night and tell these jokers some jokes,  
But who wants to laugh, who's gonna laugh  
At a broken heart?  
Oh, my heart is aching, I swear it's breaking.  
  
And I'm drinking again.  
Thinking of when you loved me.  
And I'm tryin' to get home  
With nothing, nothing but a memory.  
  
Yes, I'm dying to get home,  
Dying to get home.  
And I got nothin' but a bottle of beer,  
And just my memory.

Woke up this mornin'  
With an awful achin' head.  
Woke up this mornin'  
With an awful achin' head.  
My new man left me.  
I'm just a bloom in an empty bed.  
  
Now, when my bed gets empty  
I get to feelin' kind of mean and blue.  
When my bed gets empty,  
Get to feelin' awful mean and blue.  
The springs are gettin' rusty  
Sleepin' single like I do.  
  
I bought me a coffee grinder,  
The best one I could find.  
You know that I bought me a brand new coffee grinder,  
The best one I could find,  
So he could grind my coffee.  
Babe, I got a brand new grind.  
You gotta try, girl, you gotta try.  
  
He was a deep sea diver  
With a stroke that could not go wrong.  
Deep, deep sea, deep sea diver  
With a stroke that just could not go wrong.  
He could touch the bottom,  
And his wind held out so long.  
  
Oh, he boiled my cabbage,  
And he made it awful hot, mmmm.  
He boiled it, I got to tell you  
That he made it, made it awful hot.  
But when he slipped the bacon in,  
He overflowed the pot!  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  
What a sweet man he was.  
I went and told my girlfriend Lou.  
Remember that old rag of a girl named Lou?  
Real sweet man.  
I went and told my girlfriend Lou.  
That way that girl is, baby,  
She must have had a piece of it, too.  
  
And now when you get good lovin',  
Don't you, don't you spread the news.  
Don't you spread the news.  
When you get it and it's good, good, good,  
You really ought not to,  
You ought not to spread the news.  
Because those gals will doublecross you and leave you,  
Those gals will doublecross you, and they do,  
Those gals will doublecross you  
And leave you, leave you, leave you,  
Leave you with the empty bed blues!  
Zah!

Old friend, here we are,  
After all the years and tears  
And all that we've been through.  
It feels so good to see you.  
Lookin' back in time,  
There've been other friends and other lovers,  
But no other one like you.  
All my life, no one ever has known me better.  
  
I must have traveled down a thousand roads.  
Been so many places, seen so many faces,  
Always on my way to somethin' new.  
Oh, but it doesn't matter,  
Cause no matter where I go,  
Every road leads back,  
Every road just seems to lead me back to you.  
  
Old friend, there were times  
I didn't want to see your face  
Or hear your name again.  
Now those times are far behind me.  
It's so good to see your smile.  
I'd forgotten how nobody else  
Could make me smile the way you do.  
All this time, you're the one I still want beside me.  
  
I must have traveled down a thousand roads.  
Been so many places, seen so many faces,  
Always on my way to somethin' new.  
Oh, but it doesn't matter,  
Cause no matter where I go,  
Every road leads back,  
Every road just seems to lead me back to you.  
  
I must have traveled down a thousand roads.  
Been so many places, seen so many faces,  
Always on my way to somethin' new.  
Oh, but it doesn't matter,  
Cause no matter where I go,  
Every road leads back,  
Every road just seems to lead me back,  
Every road leads back,  
Every road just seems to lead me back to you.  
Every road just seems to lead me back to you.

I had a dream, a dream about you, baby.  
It's gonna come true, baby.  
They think that we're through, but baby,  
  
You'll be swell! You'll be great!  
Gonna have the whole world on the plate!  
Starting here, starting now,  
honey, everything's coming up roses!  
  
Clear the decks! Clear the tracks!  
You've got nothing to do but relax.  
Blow a kiss. Take a bow.  
Honey, everything's coming up roses!  
  
Now's your inning. Stand the world on it's ear!  
Set it spinning! That'll be just the beginning!  
Curtain up! Light the lights!  
You got nothing to hit but the heights!  
You'll be swell. You'll be great.  
I can tell. Just you wait.  
That lucky star I talk about is due!  
Honey, everything's coming up roses for me and for you!  
  
You can do it, all you need is a hand.  
We can do it, Mama is gonna see to it!  
Curtain up! Light the lights!  
We got nothing to hit but the heights!  
I can tell, wait and see.  
There's the bell! Follow me!  
And nothing's gonna stop us 'til we're through!  
Honey, everything's coming up roses and daffodils!  
Everything's coming up sunshine and Santa Claus!  
Everything's gonna be bright lights and lollipops!  
Everything's coming up roses for me and for you!

Never know how much I love you.  
Never know how much I care.  
When you put your arms around me,  
I get a fever that's so hard to bear.  
  
You give me fever when you kiss me.  
Fever when you hold me tight.  
Fever in the morning.  
Fever all through the night.  
  
Sun lights up the daytime,  
And moon lights up the night.  
I light up when you call my name,  
And you know I'm gonna treat you right.  
  
You give me fever when you kiss me.  
Fever when you hold me tight.  
Fever in the morning,  
And fever all through the night.  
  
Everybody's got the fever.  
That is something you all know.  
Fever isn't such a new thing.  
Fever started long ago.  
  
Romeo loved Juliet.  
Juliet, she felt the same.  
When he put his arms around her,  
He said, "Julie, baby, you're my flame.  
  
Thou giveth fever when we kisseth.  
Fever with thy flaming youth.  
Fever, I'm afire.  
Fever, yeah, I burn, forsooth."  
  
Cap'n Smith and Pocahontas  
Had a very mad affair.  
When her daddy tried to kill him,  
She said, "Daddy, oh, don't you dare.  
  
He gives me fever with his kisses.  
Fever when he holds me tight.  
Fever, I'm his missus,  
So Daddy, won't you treat him right."  
  
Now you've listened to my story,  
Here's the point that I have made:  
Chicks were born to give you fever,  
Be it Fahrenheit or Centigrade.  
  
They give you fever when you kiss them.  
Fever if you live and learn.  
Fever 'til you sizzle.  
What a lovely way to burn.  
What a lovely way to burn.  
What a lovely way to burn.  
What a lovely way to burn.

Sweetheart, the night is growing old.  
Sweetheart, my love is still untold.  
A kiss that is never tasted,  
Forever and ever is wasted.  
  
For all we know we may never meet again.  
Before you go, make this moment sweet again.  
We won't say good night until the last minute.  
I'll hold out my hand and my heart will be in it.  
  
For all we know this may only be a dream.  
We come and go like a ripple on a stream.  
So love me tonight. tomorrow's made for some.  
Tomorrow may never come, for all we know.  
  
For all we know this may only be a dream.  
We come and we go like a ripple on a stream.  
So love me tonight. tomorrow was made for some.  
Tomorrow may never come, for all we know.

We had an apartment in the city.  
Me and my husband liked living there.  
It's been years since the kids have grown,  
A life of their own, left us alone.  
  
John and linda live in omaha.  
Joe is somewhere on the road.  
We lost davy in the korean war.  
I still don't know what for, don't matter any more.  
  
You know that old trees just grow stronger,  
And old rivers grow wilder every day,  
But old people, they just grow lonesome  
Waiting for someone to say,  
"hello in there. hello"  
  
Me and my husband, we don't talk much anymore.  
He sits and stares through the backdoor screen.  
And all the news just repeats itself  
Like some forgotten dream  
That we've both seen.  
  
Someday i'll go and call up judy.  
We worked together at the factory.  
Ah, but what would I say when she asks what's new?  
Say, "nothing, what's with you?  
Nothing much to do. "  
  
You know that old trees just grow stronger,  
And old rivers grow wilder every day,  
Ah, but old people, they just grow lonesome  
Waiting for someone to say,  
"hello in there. hello."  
  
So if you're walking down the street sometime  
And you should spot some hollow ancient eyes,  
Don't you pass them by and stare  
As if you didn't care.  
Say, "hello in there. hello."

And I am all alone.  
There is no one here beside me.  
And my problems have all gone.  
There is no one to deride me.  
  
But you got to have friends.  
The feeling's oh so strong.  
You got to have friends  
To make that day last long.  
  
I had some friends but they're gone,  
Somethin' came and took them away.  
And from the dusk 'til the dawn  
Here is where I'll stay.  
  
Standing at the end of the road, boys,  
Waiting for my new friends to come.  
I don't care if I'm hungry or poor,  
I'm gonna get me some of them.  
  
Cause you got to have friends.  
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, friends.  
That's right you, oh you, yeah you,  
I said you gotta have some friends,  
I'm talkin' about friends, that's right, friends.  
Friends, friends, friends.  
  
I had some friends, oh, but they're all gone, gone,  
Someone came and snatched them away.  
And from the dusk until the very dawn, you know,  
Here is where I gotta stay, here is where I gotta stay.  
  
And I'm standing at the end of a real long road  
And I'm waiting for my new friends to come.  
I don't care if I'm hungry or freezin' cold,  
I'm gonna get me some of them.  
  
Cause you gotta have friends,  
That's right, friends, friends.  
I gotta me my, I gotta me my, I gotta me my,  
Look around and see all of my friends.  
Oh, friends, that's right, friends, friends,  
Friends, friends, friends, friends, oh,  
Friends, you gotta have friends...

From a distance  
The world looks blue and green  
And the snow capped mountains white  
From a distance  
The ocean meets the stream  
And the eagle takes to flight  
  
From a distance  
There is harmony  
And it echoes through the land  
It's the voice of hope  
It's the voice of peace  
It's the voice of every man  
  
From a distance  
We all have enough  
And no one is in need  
And there are no guns, no bombs and no disease  
No hungry mouths to feed  
From a Distance  
We are instruments  
Marching in a common band  
Playing songs of hope  
Playing songs of peace  
They are the songs of every man  
  
God is watching us  
God is watching us  
God is watching us  
From a distance  
  
From a distance  
You look like my friend  
Even though we are at war  
From a distance  
I just cannot comprehend  
What all this fightings for  
From a distance  
There is harmony  
And it echoes through the land  
And it's the hope of hopes  
It's the love of loves  
It's the heart of every man  
  
God is watching us  
God is watching us  
God is watching us  
From a distance  
  
God is watching us  
God is watching us  
God is watching us  
From a distance

You ask me what I want.  
You ask me what I need.  
It's nothing you can buy.  
My heart's not ruled by greed.  
I don't love a diamond.  
Diamond's you see through.  
I want you to hold me.  
I want you to be true.  
  
Give me the gift of love.  
Look me in the eyes.  
Say I'm the one you're dreamin' of.  
That'd be the best surprise.  
Give me the gift of your sweet love  
In the light of the day,  
In the dark of night.  
  
Like the colors of the sun,  
The feelings in your heart.  
It's all I want from you.  
And when the sky is dark  
I'll have you beside me.  
Who could ask for more?  
I'll just wear a smile  
When you walk in the door.  
  
Give me the gift of love.  
Look me in the eyes.  
Say I'm the one you're dreamin' of.  
That'd be the best surprise.  
Give me the gift of your sweet love  
In the light of the day,  
In the dark of night.  
  
Give me the gift of love.  
Look me in the eyes.  
Say I'm the one you're dreamin' of.  
That'd be the best surprise.  
Give me the gift of your sweet love  
In the light of the day,  
In the dark of night.  
  
Give me the gift of love.  
Look me in the eyes.  
Say I'm the one.  
That'd be the best surprise.  
Give me the gift of your sweet love  
In the light of the day,  
In the dark of night.  
Always. Oooooh.

Now I have nothing, so God give me strength,  
'cause I'm weak anyway,  
And if I'm strong, I might still break.  
  
And I don't have anything to share  
That I won't throw away into the air.  
That song is sung out.  
This bell is rung out.  
  
He was the light that I'd bless.  
He took my last chance of happiness.  
So God give me strength.  
God give me strength.  
  
I can't hold on to him.  
God give me strength.  
When the phone doesn't ring  
And I'm lost in imagining  
Everything that kind of love is worth  
As I tumble back down to the earth.  
  
That song is sung out.  
This bell is rung out.  
He was the light that I'd bless.  
He took my last chance of happiness.  
So God give me strength.  
  
God, if he'd grant me his indulgence and decline,  
I might as well wipe him from my memory.  
Fracture the spell as he becomes my enemy.  
And maybe I was washed out  
Like a lip print on a shirt.  
See, I'm only human, I want him to hurt.  
I want him, I want him to hurt.  
  
Since I lost the power to pretend  
That there could ever be a happy ending.  
That song is sung out.  
This bell is rung out.  
  
He was the light that I'd bless.  
He took my last chance of happiness.  
So God give me strength.  
God give me strength.  
  
Oooooooh. Oooooh.  
Wipe him from my memory.  
Oooh. I got to him wipe him from my memory.  
Mmmm. Ooooooooh.

I don't know if you can hear me  
Or if you're even there  
I don't know if you would listen  
To a humble prayer  
Yes, I know I'm just an outcast  
I shouldn't speak to you  
Still I see your face and wonder  
Were you once an outcast too  
  
I ask for nothing  
I can get by  
But I know so many  
Less lucky than I  
God help the outcasts  
The poor and down trod  
I thought we all were  
The children of God  
  
I don't know if there's a reason  
  
Why some are blessed, some not  
Why the few you seem to favour  
They fear us  
Flee us  
Try not to see us  
  
God help the outcasts  
The tattered the torn  
Seeking an answer  
To why they were born  
Winds of misfortune  
Have blown them about  
You made the outcasts  
Don't cast them out  
  
The poor and unlucky  
The weak and the odd  
I thought we all were  
The children of  
God...

Well hello. Gee, I can't believe you're here with me.  
Oh, I've wanted to see you alone for so long.  
Where did you learn to do all that?  
Oh, c'mon over here,  
Sit down right next to me.  
Oh, c'mon, don't be afraid.  
I ain't gonna hurt you.  
Just want to show you a few things  
I picked up when you went away.  
Like this. Ah, don't feel bad.  
Oh, so good, so good, so good.  
You and me have got in bed.  
  
Now that we caress,  
A kiss so warm and tender,  
I can't wait 'til we reach  
That sweet moment of surrender.  
Oh, we'll hear the thunder roar,  
Feel lightning strike.  
We don't have to hurry,  
'Cause you know we got all night.  
  
Hang on in there, baby.  
Hang on in there, doll.  
I'm gonna give you more  
Than you've ever dreamed possible.  
Hang on in there, baby.  
Hang on in there, doll.  
I'm gonna give you more  
Than you've ever dreamed possible.  
  
Don't be afraid, baby. Oh, no.  
You're the master of the world.  
Whoa, we can't help but make it,  
Because there's real love between us, boy.  
Whoa, c'mon, help me touch that fire  
That every girl dreams of.  
We're almost there little boy.  
We're truly making love.  
  
Hang on in there, baby.  
Hang on in there, doll.  
I'm gonna give you more  
Than you ever dreamed possible.  
Hang on in there, baby.  
Please don't let me down.  
Please don't destroy  
This new joy we've found.  
  
Uh, so heavy, uh.  
Listen now, baby.  
What is that you say?  
Something eating at you?  
It's gonna get away.  
Don't you fight it, baby.  
C'mon, open up the door.  
That's the key to freedom  
We've been working for.  
Let it go, baby. Let it go, honey.  
Oh, right there, right there.  
Now don't you move it anywhere.  
Let it go. Let it go!  
  
Hang on in there, baby.  
Oh, hang on in there, doll.  
I'm gonna give you more  
Than you ever dreamed possible.  
Hang on in there, baby.  
Please don't let me down.  
Please don't destroy  
This new joy we found.  
  
Hang on in there, baby.  
Hang on in there, doll.  
I'm gonna give you more  
Than you ever dreamed possible.  
Hang on in there, baby.  
Please don't let me down.  
Please don't destroy  
This brand new joy we found.  
  
Yeah, oh yeah. c'mon, baby.  
Ah, do it to me one more time.  
Dig that boy. Ooh-hoo. Mmmm.  
One more time, yeah.  
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go.  
Let it go.  
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go.  
Let it go.  
  
Hang on, hang on, hang on,  
'Cause I love ya.  
Hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on.  
Hang on in there, baby.  
Hang on in there, doll.

Let it go.  
Hang on in there, baby.  
Hang on in there, doll.  
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go

It seem like happiness is just a thing called Joe.  
He's got a smile that makes the lilacs want to grow.  
He's got a way that makes the angels heave a sigh  
When they know little Joe's passing by.  
Sometimes the cabin's gloomy and the table's bare,  
But then he'll kiss me and it's Christmas everywhere.  
Troubles fly away and life is easy go.  
Does he love me good? That's all I need to know.  
Seems like happiness is just a thing called Joe.

Troubles fly away and life is easy go.  
Does he love me good? That's all I need to know.  
Seems like happiness is just a thing called Joe.  
Little Joe, my little Joe, little Joe.

He needs me.  
He doesn't know it, but he needs me.  
And so no matter where he goes,  
Though he doesn't care,  
He knows that I'm here.  
  
He needs me.  
I ought to leave him, but he needs me.  
I know that I ain't very bright  
Just to tag along,  
Oh, but right or wrong  
I'm his and I'm here,  
And I'm gonna be his friend or his lover.  
  
'Cause my one ambition is  
To wake him and make him discover  
That he needs me.  
I've got to follow where he leads me  
Or else he'll never know that I need him  
Just as he needs me.

I had a will of iron  
I had a heart of steel  
I always call the shots  
But, honey, you shoot to kill  
I've spent a hundred other nights like this  
A little laughter and a stranger's kiss  
  
But the next thing that I knew  
I was heart over head  
Over heart over head over you  
It's too late to stop it now  
I'm heart over head  
Over heart over head over you  
  
I never once imagined  
A night like this before  
That love would last for hours  
And still I begged for more  
If I sound a little crazy  
Well, forgive me, please  
My head is swimmin'  
And I'm on my knees  
  
Cryin', "Love me, love me, do!"  
Because I'm heart over head  
Over heart over head over you  
Too late to stop it now  
I'm heart over head  
Over heart over head over you  
  
Can't seem to slow down  
Can't even touch the ground  
The harder I try  
The higher I fly  
  
I'm fallin' heart over head  
Over heart over head over you  
Where did you get your touch?  
I'm heart over head  
Over heart over head over you  
I like it much too much  
Heart over head  
Over heart over head over you  
Too late to stop it now  
I'm heart over head  
Over heart over head over you...

He's a tramp but they love him  
Breaks a new heart every day  
He's a tramp, they adore him  
And I only hope he'll stay that way  
He's a tramp, he's a scoundrel  
He's a rounder, he's a cad  
He's a tramp but I love him  
Yes, even I have got it pretty bad  
You can never tell when he'll show up  
He gives you plenty of trouble  
I guess, he's just a no account pup  
But I wish that he were double  
He's a tramp, he's a rover  
And there's nothing more to say  
If he's a tramp, he's a good one  
And I wish that I could travel his way  
You can never tell when he'll show up

He's a tramp, he's a rover  
And there's nothing more to say  
If he's a tramp, he's a good one  
And I wish that I could travel his way  
I wish that I could travel his way  
What a dog  

You drove into town like the wind.  
Hot on the heels of the rain.  
And in your eyes all is calm.  
That's why they call you Hurricane.  
  
You blow me away.  
You blow me away.  
  
Ooh, what a powerful force  
Howling around in my brain.  
Knocking me down with your touch.  
Mmm, that's why they call you Hurricane.  
  
You blow me away.  
Oh, oh, you blow me away.  
  
Hurricane gonna kill me!  
Honey, you sure do thrill me!  
Swallow me without a sound.  
Hurricane is a-rising,  
Hot and so surprising.  
Forecast warns I'm gonna drown.  
Blow me and swell me on down.  
  
You blow me away.  
You blow me away!  
Ah, ah-mmm, blow me away.  
  
Hurricane gonna kill me!  
Ah, honey you sure do thrill me!  
Swallow me without a sound.  
Hurricane is a-rising,  
Hot and so surprising!  
Forecast warns I'm gonna drown.  
Baby, just go on down!  
  
Leave broken hearts in your wake.  
I ain't the one to complain, no, no, no!  
You blow all the lives that you take.  
Give me a ride, won't you Hurricane?  
  
You blow me away.  
You blow me away.  
Oh, Hurricane, blow me away.  
You, only you, blow me away, ahh.  
  
Hurricane is rising, it keeps surprising me.  
Spinnin' me around and around.  
Don't let me down.  
Hurricane is rising, it keeps surprising me.  
Hurry, hurry, Hurricane.  
  
Tell me you love me.  
He really does love me.  
Spinnin' me around and around.  
Don't let me down.  
Hurricane is rising, it keeps surprising me.  
Hurry, hurry, Hurricane.  
  
Baby, you and I sky high!  
You and I sky high!  
Baby, you and I sky high!  
You and I sky high!  
Destiny is calling me.  
All I want is calling me away.

Hurry on down to my house, honey,  
Ain't nobody home but me.  
Hurry on down to my house, baby.  
Oh, I'm blue as I can be.  
I love you. You love me.  
A-hurry through the alley  
So the neighbors don't see.  
Hurry on down to my house, honey,  
Ain't nobody home but me. Oh.  
  
Hurry on down to my house, baby,  
Ain't nobody home but me.  
Hurry on down to my house, baby.  
I'm blue as I can be.  
  
Oh, blue when the clock a-went  
Tick-tock-tick.  
Ooh, c'mon, honey, quick, quick, quick.  
Hurry on down to my house, baby,  
Ain't nobody home but me.  
  
Say, hurry, hurry, a-nobody's home.  
Hurry on down, baby,  
I'm blue as I can be.  
Oh, please come down  
Just as soon as you can.  
If you don't come down,  
I got to call Sam!  
You know the man is crazy about me.  
Ain't nobody home but me . . . ow!  
  
"Well, what's goin' on with the three of yous? c'mon, c'mon, make it snappy.
c'mon, c'mon, work out, work out! Go, babe, get down, get down! Oh, lord!
Nobody's home!"  
  
Say, hurry on down to my house, baby,  
Ain't nobody home.  
Haul it down, drag it down,  
Any way to get it down.  
I'm blue as I can be.  
Ashes-to-ashes. Dust-to-dust.  
C'mon, honey, you must, you must!  
Hurry on down to my house, baby,  
Ain't nobody home but me.  
  
Hurry, hurry. A-nobody's home.  
Haul it down and drag it down.  
You know I can't stand to be alone.  
Operator, get me hillside, 409.  
A-don't stop ringin'  
'til you get that baby's line!  
He's gonna haul it down!  
Ain't nobody home but, you believe it,  
There's nobody home but me! Wo!

I don't believe in superstars  
In fancy food or foreign cars  
That Hagen Dazs and motherhood  
Have done my body any good.  
That Elvis is alive and well  
That courtesy has gone to Hell  
That kindness is in short supply  
That little kids should have to die.  
  
But I believe in love.  
I believe in dreamers.  
I believe in miracles  
And I believe in you.  
  
Well, I don't believe virginity  
Is as common as it used to be  
That left is wrong and right is right  
That black is black and white is white.  
That the Beatles could be history  
The sixties just a memory  
That war will never go away  
That Johnny Carson's had his day.  
  
But I believe in love  
I believe in angels  
I believe in Mom and Dad  
And I believe in you  
  
I know with almost certainty  
What's going on with you and me  
Is a good thing  
I know it's true  
I believe in you.  
  
Now, I don't believe that Heaven waits  
For only those who congregate  
I like to think that God is love.  
He's down below, He's up above,  
And He's watching people everywhere  
He knows who does and doesn't care.  
And I'm an ordinary girl  
Trying to make my way in this old world.  
  
And I believe in love  
Yes, I believe in music  
I believe in promises  
And I believe in you.  
  
Well, I know with almost certainty  
What's going on with you and me  
Is a good thing, a good thing  
And I know it's true  
I believe in you.  
  
You know darlin', that I believe in love.  
Yes, I believe in dreamers  
I believe in miracle  
And I believe in you.  
  
Woah-ho-ho-oh baby, I believe  
Yes, I believe.  
I believe in promises  
And I believe in you.  
  
Woah, come on, baby, say you believe in love.  
Say you believe in dreamin'.  
Believe in blue, blue skies,  
'Cause I believe in you . . .

And I don't want,  
I, I don't want,  
I don't want the night to end.  
  
Oh, daddy, daddy.  
Oh, daddy, daddy.  
Wastin' half my life  
on platforms underground,  
the other half I'm spending  
as a desperate clown.  
My problem now is that  
you're nowhere to be found.  
In dark delicious dreams  
of you I'll drown.  
  
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-hi.  
Oh, daddy. Oh, daddy.  
Ooooooooh. Oh, daddy. Oh, daddy.  
I don't want the night to end.  
  
Oh, baby, baby.  
Ohhhhh, my sweet baby.  
Wrapped around your soul  
is where I want to be.  
But in the night, blue music.  
All my eyes can see:  
Junkies in the rain,  
down on their knees.  
Tell me, what's to become  
of you and me?  
  
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.  
Don't let it be, don't let it be over.  
No, no, don't let it be, don't let it be.  
I-i, I don't want the night to end.  
I don't want the night to end.  
I-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i, I don't want the night to end.  
Mmmm, say it again, now.  
I-i-i-i-i, I don't want, don't want the night to end.  
  
Don't let it be, don't let it be,  
don't let it be o-o-o-o-over.  
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  
I don't want it to be over.  
Baby, I'm a soul to lend.  
I'm all, all alone. I don't want the night to end.  
Oh, mommy, mommy, I am falling.

I know these streets and these backyards,  
This barn that's falling down.  
We come to where they're building now  
And ride our bikes around.  
  
And you think I'm just a little kid,  
Some troubles on the way.  
Well, I knew this place before you did  
Is all I've got to say.  
  
I'm only walking  
Through these streets and all around.  
I'm only walking.  
I know this town.  
  
We come home through these fields at night  
About a million times.  
I'd walk the road with my eyes closed  
And all the paths besides.  
  
And I know the boy who broke this fence,  
And I know his brother, too.  
And they'd never give me half a chance  
If I let on to you.  
  
I'm only walking  
Through these streets and all around.  
I'm only walking.  
I know this town.  
I know this town.  
  
We dam the streams, we raid the shacks,  
And hide in boxcars on the tracks.  
We know these quarries in our sleep  
And where they're cold and where they're deep.  
  
I'll go down to the bowling alley  
And buy smokes and Dentyne.  
I find some loose change every day  
Under that Coke machine.  
  
You check me out as you drive by  
Like there was some big deal.  
Well I know so much you'll never find  
From there behind the wheel.  
  
I'm only walking  
Through these streets and all around.  
I'm only walking.  
I know this town.  
I know this town.  
I know this town.  
I know this town.

I love the East. I love the West.  
North and South, their both the best.  
But I only want go there as a guest,  
'Cause I love being here with you.  
  
I love the sea. I love the shore.  
I love the rocks, and what is more,  
You and they never be a bore,  
'Cause I love being here with you.  
  
Singing in the shower,  
Laughing by the hour.  
Life is such a breezy game.  
I love all kinds of weather  
As log as we're together.  
Oh, I love to hear you say my name.  
  
I love good wine, fine cuisine,  
Candle light. I love the scene.  
'Cause, baby, if you know just what I mean,  
I love being here with you.  
  
I like a Dance by Fred Astaire,  
And Brando's eyes, Yul Brynner's hair.  
But I think to tell you's only fair,  
That I love being here with you.  
  
And Cary Grant, oh do-dah-day,  
His utter charm takes me away.  
But don't get me wrong, how do you say,  
I love being here with you.  
  
Basie's band a-swingin',  
I like Ella's singing.  
'Cause there's something else, you know,  
They know how to say it,  
They know how to play it,  
They wind it up and let it go.  
  
I love the thrill of New York shows.  
I'd love to kiss Durante's nose.  
But I'll like to say before I close,  
I love being here with you!

Bartender, I'd like a Manhattan please  
  
Stop me if you've heard this one  
But I feel as though we've met before  
Perhaps I am mistaken  
But it's just that I remind you of  
Someone you used to care about  
Oh, but that was long ago  
Now tell me, do you really think I'd fall for that old line  
I was not born just yesterday  
Besides I never talk to strangers anyway  
  
Hell, I ain't a bad guy when you get to know me  
I just thought there ain't no harm  
Hey, yeah, just try minding your own business, bud  
Who asked you to annoy me  
With your sad, sad repartee  
Besides I never talk to strangers anyway  
  
Your life's a dime store novel  
This town is full of guys like you  
And you're looking for someone to take the place of her  
You must be reading my mail  
And you're bitter cause he left you  
That's why you're drinkin' in this bar  
Well, only suckers fall in love with perfect strangers  
  
It always takes one to know one stranger  
Maybe we're just wiser now  
Yeah, and been around that block so many times  
That we don't notice  
That we're all just perfect strangers  
As long as we ignore  
That we all begin as strangers  
Just before we find  
We really aren't strangers anymore  
  
Aw, you don't look like such a chump  
Aw, hey baby

I put a spell on you  
And now you're mine.  
You can't stop the things I do.  
I ain't lyyyyyin'.  
  
It's been 300 years  
Right down to the day,  
Now the witch is back  
And there's hell to pay.  
  
I put a spell on you  
And now you're miiiiiine!  
  
Hello, Salem! My name's Winifred, what's yours?  
  
I put a spell on you  
And now you're gone. (gone gone gone so long!)  
My whammy fell on you  
And it was strong. (so strong so strong so strong)  
  
Your wretched little lives  
Have all been cursed,  
'cause of all the witches working  
I'm the worst!  
  
I put a spell on you  
And now you're mine!  
  
[Watch out! Watch out! Watch out! Watch out!]  
  
If you don't believe,  
You'd better get superstitious.  
  
Ask my sisters!  
"Ooh, she's vicious!"  
I put a spell on you....  
I put a spell on you.  
Sisters!  
  
Ah say ento pi alpha mabi upendi  
Ah say ento pi alpha mabi upendi  
In comma coriyama  
In comma coriyama  
Ay, ay, aye, aye, say bye-byyyyyyyyyyye! Bye bye!

They say everything can be replaced  
That every distance is not near  
So I remember every face  
Of every man who put me here  
They say every woman needs protection  
Then they turn around and tell you  
Every woman's got to fall  
I swear, I see my own reflection  
Somewhere far beyond this wall  
I see my life come shining  
From the west down to the east  
Any day now, any day now  
I shall be released  
Now, yonder stands there in that lonely crowd  
A man who swears he is not to blame, no, no  
And if you ask him has he ever seen this lonely woman?  
He'll tell you, "No, no, no"  
What's more, he does not know my name  
But I see my light come shining  
Shining, shining, shining from the west  
Straight on down to the east  
Ah, any day now, any, any old day now  
I am going to, I am going to be released, yeah  
They tell ya, they tell ya every woman  
They tell ya every woman got to have protection  
Then they turn around and tell ya  
"No, we gonna make that a woman fall"  
Oh, god, I swear, I swear I see  
I see my, my very own reflection  
Far and away beyond, way, way beyond these four walls  
That's right, I see, I see my life, my life  
My life is shining, shining, shining  
Shining, shining, shining, shining  
From the west straight on down to the east  
And any day now, do you hear me?  
Any day now, I shall be, I am going to be released  
Any day now, any day now, any day now  
Any, any day now, oh, any day now  
Any day, any day, any day  
Any day, any day, any day  
Woah, any day, any day, any old day now  
Yeah, any day now, I am going to, I shall be released  
Woah, any day now, I shall see again  
Any day now, I shall be free again  
Any day now, they'll let me be again  
Oh, any day now, any day now, any day now  
Whoa, help me, any day, any day  
Any old day now  

All over town they're talking about me  
The whole world knows you're happy without me  
You've broken my heart, So what do I care?  
I'm thru with love, no more will I need it  
The word itself, I'll never repeat it  
A sign on my back I will wear, "This is my last love affair"  
  
I gave my heart to you, the one that I trusted  
You brought it back to me all broken and busted  
So I sold my heart to the junkman  
And I'll never fall in love again  
You took my heart because you thought you could use it  
Just like a little toy you battered and bruised it  
So I sold my heart to the junkman  
And I'll never fall in love again  
Like a melodrama, in a simple manner  
Love played the leading part  
We had planned a happy ending  
But I'm left with a broken heart  
I'll throw away my pride and say we'll be friends, dear  
Tear drops I cannot hide for this is the end, dear  
I've sold my heart to the junkman  
And I'll never fall in love again

Tear drops I cannot hide for this is the end, dear  
I've sold my heart to the junkman  

Broken windows and empty hallways,  
A pale dead moon in a sky streaked with grey.  
Human kindness is overflowing,  
And I think it's gonna rain today.  
  
Scarecrows dressed in the latest styles,  
The frozen smiles to chase love away.  
Human kindness is overflowing,  
And I think it's gonna rain today.  
  
Lonely, lonely.  
Tin can at my feet,  
I think I'll kick it down the street.  
That's the way to treat a friend.  
  
Bright before me the signs implore me:  
Help the needy and show them the way.  
Human kindness is overflowing,  
And I think it's gonna rain today.  
  
Lonely, so lonely.  
Tin can at my feet,

If Momma was married, we'd live in a house  
As private as private can be  
Just Momma, three ducks, five canaries, a mouse  
Two monkeys, one father, six turtles and me  
If Momma was married  
If Momma was married, I'd jump in the air  
And give all my toe shoes to you  
I'd get all those hair ribbons out of my hair  
And once and for all, I'd get Momma out too  
If Momma was married  
Momma get out your white dress  
You've done it before without much success  
Momma, Godspeed and God bless  
We're not keeping score, what's one more or less?  
Oh, Momma, say yes  
And waltz down the hall while you may  
I'll gladly support you, I'll even escort you  
And I'd gladly give you away  
Oh, Momma, get married today  
If Momma was married there wouldn't be anymore  
'Let's me entertain you', 'Let me make you smile'  
'I will do some kicks', 'I would do some tricks'  
Sing out, Louise, smile, baby  
Momma, please take our advice  
We aren't The Lunts, I'm not Fanny Brice  
Momma, we'll buy you the rice  
If only this once you wouldn't think twice  
It could be so nice if Momma got married to stay  
But Momma gets married and married and married  
And never gets carried away  
Oh, Momma, oh, Momma, oh, Momma, get married today  

I'm dreaming tonight of a place I love  
Even more than I usually do  
And although I know it's a long road back  
I promise you  
  
That I'll be home for Christmas, you can count on me  
We'll have snow and mistletoe and presents 'neath the tree  
Christmas Eve will find me where the love-light gleams  
I'll be home for Christmas if only in my dreams  
  
Christmas Eve will find me where the love-light gleams  
I'll be home for Christmas if only in my dreams  
If only in my dreams

Well I can wash out forty four pairs of socks  
And have 'em on the line.  
You know I can starch and iron two dozen shirts  
'fore you can count from one to nine.  
I can slip up a great big dip up of lard  
From a drippings can.  
Throw it in the skillet, do my shopping,  
And be back before it melts in the pan.  
  
'Cause I'm a woman  
W-O-M-A-N.  
Let me tell ya again.  
I'm a woman  
W-O-M-A-N.  
  
Well I can rub and scrub  
'til this house shines just like a dime.  
Feed the baby, grease the car,  
Powder my nose at the same time.  
You know I can get all dressed up,  
Go out swinging with the M-A-N,  
Jump in bed at five, sleep 'til 6,  
And start all over again.  
  
'Cause I'm a woman  
W-O-M-A-N.  
Let me tell ya again.  
I'm a woman  
W-O-M-A-N.  
  
Well now if you come to me sick,  
You know that I'm gonna make you well.  
And if you come to me all hexed up,  
You know I'm gonna break the spell.  
And if you come to me hungry,  
You know I'll feed ya full of my grits.  
And if it's loving you want,  
I can kiss you and give you the shivering fits.  
  
'Cause I'm a woman  
W-O-M-A-N.  
I'll say it again.  
I'm a woman  
W-O-M-A-N.  
  
Well, I got a twenty dollar gold fee  
That says there's nothing that I can't do.  
Well, I can make a dress out of feeding sacks,  
And I can make a man out Of you.  
  
'Cause I'm a woman  
W-O-M-A-N.  
I'll say it again.  
I'm a woman  
W-O-M-A-N.  
  
I'm a woman.  
I'm a woman.  
I'm a woman.  
Yeah, I'm a woman.

"That's it, baby! When you got it, flaunt it, flaunt it!"  
  
"This is the Divine Miss M and I'm here to share with you some rare and
stimulating insight into my cosmic fabulosity. It's really very simple. I
smiply believe with all my heart:"  
  
I'm beautiful, I'm beautiful, I'm beautiful, dammit!  
I'm beautiful, I'm beautiful, I'm beautiful, dammit!  
I'm beautiful, so beautiful, I'm beautiful, dammit!  
I'm beautiful, I'm beautiful, I'm beautiful, dammit!  
  
"Go away, little girl," they used to say.  
"Hey, you're too fat, baby, you can't play."  
"Hold on, miss thing, what you trying to do?  
You know you're too wack to be in our school."  
  
Too wack, too smart, too fast, too fine,  
Too loud, too tough, too too divine.  
I said you don't belong. You don't belong.  
Too loud, too big, too much to bear,  
Too bold, too brash, too prone to swear.  
I heard that song for much too long.  
  
Ain't this my sun? Ain't this my moon?  
Ain't this my world to be who I choose?  
Ain't this my song? Ain't this my movie?  
Ain't this my world? I know I can do it.  
  
I'm not too short, I'm not too tall,  
I'm not too big, I'm not too small.  
Ooh, don't lemme start lovin' myself!  
Ooh, don't lemme start lovin' myself!  
I'm not too white, I'm not too black,  
I'm not too this, I'm not too that.  
Ooh, don't lemme start lovin' myself!  
Ooh, don't lemme start lovin' myself!  
  
I'm beautiful, I'm beautiful, I'm beautiful, dammit!  
I'm beautiful, I'm beautiful, I'm beautiful, dammit!  
  
It's time to call it what it is. Don't play the naming game.  
Become what you were born to be and be it unashamed.  
"Go away, little boy," I can hear them say,  
"Everybody on the block says they think you're gay.  
Hold on, my friend, do you think we're blind?  
Take a look at yourself. You're not our kind."  
  
Too black, too white, too short, too tall,  
Too blue, too green, too red, too small.  
I said you don't belong. You don't belong.  
Too black, too white, too short, too tall,  
Too blue, too green, too red, too small.  
I heard that song for much to long.  
  
Ain't this my sun? Ain't this my moon?  
Ain't this my world to be who I choose?  
Ain't this my song? Ain't this my movie?  
Ain't this my world? I know I can do it.  
  
People always ask me,  
"Miss M, how did you get so far  
On so little?" Shut up!  
Well, I woke up one morning,  
Flossed my teeth and decided,  
"Damn, I'm fierce!" You look good!  
You can be just like me! A goddess? Yeah!  
Don't just pussy foot around and sit on your assets.  
Unleash your ferocity upon an unsuspecting world.  
Rise up and repeat after me: "I'm beautiful!"  
  
I'm beautiful, I'm beautiful, I'm beautiful!  
Can you say that?  
I'm beautiful, I'm beautiful, I'm beautiful!  
I don't hear you!  
I'm beautiful, I'm beautiful, I'm beautiful!  
Louder!  
I'm beautiful, I'm beautiful, I'm beautiful!  
Hey!  
  
That's it, baby, when you got it, flaunt it, flaunt it!  
  
Aaaaaah!  
Ain't this my sun? My sun! Ain't this my moon? My moon!  
Ain't this my world to be who I choose?  
Ain't this our song? Ain't this our song?  
Ain't this our movie? Ain't this our movie?  
Ain't this our world to be who we choose?  
  
I'm not too short, I'm not too tall,  
I'm not too big, I'm not too small.  
Ooh, don't lemme start lovin' myself!  
Ooh, don't lemme start lovin' myself!  
I'm not too white, I'm not too black,  
I'm not too this, I'm not too that.  
Ooh, don't lemme start lovin' myself!  
Ooh, don't lemme start lovin' myself!  
I'm beautiful, dammit!

"Oh man, do you believe that chick? She has got no idea what's happening, no
idea.  
I am the one who's plugged in around here.  
That's why they call me The High Priestess of Cool! Ha ha!  
  
See, I'm hip. I'm no square.  
I'm alert, I'm awake, I'm aware.  
I am always on the scene.  
Makin' the rounds, diggin' the sounds.  
I read People Magazine.  
'Cause I'm hip.  
  
Like, dig! I'm in step.  
When it was hip to be hep, I was hep.  
I don't blow but I'm a fan.  
Look at me swing. Ring a ding ding.  
I even call my girlfriend "man,"  
'Cause I'm hip.  
  
Every Saturday night  
With my suit buttoned tight and my suedes on  
I'm gettin' my kicks  
diggin' arty French flicks with my shades on.  
  
I'm too much. I'm a gas.  
I am anything but middle class.  
When I hang around the band,  
poppin' my thumbs, diggin' the drums,  
sqaures don't seem to understand  
why I flip. They're not hip like I'm hip.  
I'm hip!  
  
I'm on top of every trend.  
Look at me go. Vo-dee-o-do.  
Sammy Davis knew my friend.  
  
I'm hip, but not weird.  
Like, you notice, I don't wear a beard.  
Beards were in but now they're not.  
They had they're day. Now they're passe.  
Just ask me if you're in doubt,  
'Cause I'm hip.  
  
Now I'm deep into Zen  
meditation and macrobiotics,  
and as soon as I can  
I intend to get into narcotics.  
  
'Cause I'm cool as a cuke.  
I'm a cat, I'm a card, I'm a kook, kook, kook.  
I get so much out of life.  
Really, I do. Skoo ba dee boo.  
One more time play "Mack the Knife."  
Let 'er rip. I may flip, but I'm hip.

I'm singing Broadway and I love it!  
I'm singing Broadway and I'm proud!  
You can keep your Springsteen.  
Shove your Chaka.  
I really don't care for that kind of kaka.  
Ethel, Liza, Chita, that's my crowd, my crowd!  
  
Yes-sah, I'm singing Broadway and it's heaven!  
'Cause "Heaven" is a song from a Broadway show!  
Ah, just give me a part that's got laughter and tears  
And I'll beat it like Yul Brenner for the next thousand years!  
Ah, Broadway, Broadway, Broadway! Brrrrrravo!  
  
Ahhh, who needs a girl who's got flourescent hair,  
Or an ugly boy singing off key?  
Give me a broad who's got tits out to there,  
Belching it out to the balcony!  
  
AhhhAHHHHHHHH!!!!  
Yes, sir! I'm singing Broadway and it's heaven!  
I'll be singing Broadway, yes, 'til I die!  
Just tell me what could be better  
Than shaking your buns  
In front of a chorus  
Of thirty-five nuns?  
I'll climb every mountain  
And ford every river I see.  
A Lady and her muszack,  
Ha-that's ha-me! Yeah!

There are places I remember  
All my life, though some have changed.  
Some forever, not for better.  
And some have gone, and some remain.  
  
All these places have their moments  
With lovers and friends I still can't recall.  
Some are dead and some are living.  
In my life I love them all.  
  
But of all these friends and lovers,  
There is no one compares with you.  
And these memories lose their meaning  
When I think of love as something new.  
  
Though I know I'll never ever lose affection  
For people and things that went before,  
I know I'll often stop and think about them.  
In my life I love you more.  
  
Though I know I'll never ever lose affection  
For people and things that went before,  
I know I'll often stop and think of them.  
But in my life I loved you more.  
I love you more.  
I love you more.

Sue wants a barbecue.  
Sam wants to boil a ham.  
Grace votes for bouillabaisse stew.  
Jake wants a weenie bake,  
Stake and a layer cake.  
He'll get a tummy ache, too.  
We'll rent a tent or teepee.  
Let the town cryer cry.  
And if it's RSVP,  
This is what I'll reply:  
  
In the cool, cool, cool of the evenin',  
Tell 'em I'll be there.  
In the cool, cool, cool of the evenin',  
Better save a chair.  
When the party's gettin' a glow on,  
Singin' fills the air.  
In the shank of the night,  
When the doins' are right,  
Well you can tell 'em I'll be there.  
  
"Oui," said the bumblebee,  
"Let's have jubilee."  
"When?" said the prairie hen, "Soon?"  
"Sure," said the dinosaur.  
"Where?" said the grisly bear.  
"Under the light of the moon."  
"How 'bout your brother, jackass?"  
Everyone gaily cried.  
"You comin' to the fracas?"  
"Offer respects," he sighed.  
  
In the coooool of the evenin',  
Tell 'em I'll be there.  
In the coooool of the evenin',  
Better save a chair.  
When the party's gettin' a glow on,  
Singin' fills the air.  
If I ain't in a clique,  
And there's something to pick,  
Well you can tell 'em I'll be there.  
If I can crawl out of bed  
And slap a hat on my head,  
Well you can tell 'em I'll be there.  
If there's room for one more,  
And you need me, why sure,  
Tell 'em, tell 'em I'll be there.

For all I've been blessed with in this life,  
There was an emptiness in me.  
I was imprisoned by the power of gold.  
With one kind touch you sent me free.  
  
Let the world stop turning.  
Let the sun stop burning.  
Let them tell me love's not worth going through.  
If it all falls apart,  
I will know deep in my heart  
The only dream that mattered had come true:  
In this life I was loved by you.  
  
For every mountain I have climbed,  
Every raging river crossed,  
You were the treasure that I longed to find.  
Without your love I would be lost.  
  
Let the world stop turning.  
Let the sun stop burning.  
Let them tell me love's not worth going through.  
If it all falls apart,  
I will know deep in my heart  
The only dream that mattered had come true:  
In this life I was loved by you.  
  
I know that I won't live forever,  
But forever I'll be loving you.  
  
Let the world stop turning.  
Let the sun stop burning.  
Let them tell me love's not worth going through.  
If it all falls apart,  
I will know deep in my heart  
The only dream that mattered had come true:  
In this life I was loved by you.  
In this life I was loved by you.

Don't ask me why  
You feel the need to cry  
Stop  
We don't need your sad, sad eyes  
I've been up, I've been down  
I've been wandering all around  
But it's all right  
I found out the hard way  
Is it love that makes  
Your world go 'round and 'round?  
Is it love that brings  
You to my lost and found?  
Around, around, around  
Around, around, around  
Around, around  
Is it you? Is it me?  
I'm my own worst enemy  
Got a start on the road  
To self-destruction, ooh, whoa  
Don't stop, but don't go,  
'Cause I really need to know  
What it takes just to make  
[Unverified] this world go, ooh  
Is it love that makes  
The world go 'round and 'round?  
Is it love that brings  
You to my lost and found?  
Around, around, around  
Around, around, around  
Around, around, around, around  
Ohh, is it love that makes  
Your world go 'round and 'round?  
Is it love that brings  
You to my lost and found?  
Around, around, around  
Around, around, around  
Around, around, around, around  
Is it love that makes  
The world go 'round and around?  
Is it love that brings  
You to my lost and found?  
Around, around, around  
Around, around, around  
Around, around, around, around  
Come around, come around  
Come around, around  
Come around, come around  
Come around, around  
Come around, come around  
Come around, around  

"I remember when I was a very little girl, our house caught on fire.  
I'll never forget the look on my father's face as he gathered me up in his
arms  
And raced through the burning building out to the pavement.  
I stood there shivering in my pajamas and watched the whole world go up in
flames.  
And when it was all over I said to myself,  
'Is that all there is to a fire?'"  
  
Is that all there is?  
Is that all there is?  
If that's all there is, my friends,  
Then let's keep dancing.  
Let's break out the booze  
And have a ball  
If that's all there is.  
  
"And when I was 12 years old, my father took me to the circus,  
The greatest show on earth.  
There were clowns and elephants and dancing bears  
And a beautiful lady in pink tights flew high above our heads.  
And as I sat there watching the marvelous spectacle,  
I had the feeling that something was missing.  
I don't know what, but when it was over I said to myself,  
'Is that all there is to a circus?'"  
  
Is that all there is?  
Is that all there is?  
If that's all there is, my friends,  
Then let's keep dancing.  
Let's break out the booze  
And have a ball  
If that's all there is.  
  
"Then I fell in love with the most wonderful boy in the world.  
We would take long walks by the river  
Or just sit for hours gazing into each other's eyes.  
We were so very much in love. Then one day, he went away.  
And I thought I'd die, but I didn't.  
And when I didn't, I said to myself,  
'Is that all there is to love?'"  
  
Is that all there is?  
Is that all there is?  
If that's all there is, my friends,  
Then let's keep dancing.  
  
"I know what you must be saying to yourselves.  
'If that's the way she feels about it why doesn't she just end it all?'  
Oh, no. Not me. I'm in no hurry for that final disappointment.  
For I know just as well as I'm standing here talking to you,  
When that final moment comes and I'm breathing my last breath,  
I'll be saying to myself"  
  
Is that all there is?  
Is that all there is?  
If that's all there is, my friends,  
Then let's keep dancing.  
Let's break out the booze  
And have a ball  
If that's all there is.

If I close my eyes,  
Take my time,  
I can almost feel your lips against mine.  
If I close my eyes,  
Drift away,  
I can almost see us back there smiling.  
  
But it's too late, it's too late.  
Baby, I can't reach you.  
It's too late, too late.  
We've drifted out too far.  
I don'e know where love goes  
Or how we might have saved it,  
I only know it's gone.  
It's time that we moved on.  
It's too late.  
  
No use going on.  
No more crying.  
Stand outside ourselves and watch love dying.  
  
'cause it's too late, it's too late.  
Baby, I can't hold you.  
It's too late, too late.  
Now time will take it's toll.  
I don't know where love goes  
Or how we might have saved it.  
I only know it's gone.  
It's time that we moved on.  
It's too late.  
  
In my dreams we turn it back around  
And the love we lost is found,  
And I hand it all to you.  
But I know I'm only dreamin'.  
It's too late. ahhhhh, it's too late.  
  
Should I stay, should I wait,  
Should I stand here by your door?  
I don't know what for.  
You don't live here anymore.  
And it's too late.  
My little baby.  
Yeah-ahhh, it's too late.  
It's too late.

I'm always a flop at a top-notch affair,  
But I've still got my health, so what do I care?  
My best ring, alas, is a glass solitaire,  
But I still got my health, so what do I care?  
  
By fashion and foppery, I'm never discussed.  
Attending the opry, my box would be a bust.  
I never shall have that Park Avenue aire,  
But I'm in such health, why should I care?  
  
The hip that I shake doesn't make people stare,  
But I got such health, what do I care?  
The sight of my props never stops a thoroughfare,  
But I still got my health, so what do I care?  
  
Your face is your fortune, so some wise men spoke.  
My face is my fortune, that's why I'm totally broke.  
My ship ain't come in, but I grin while I bear,  
'cause I got my vitamins:  
A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H  
I still have my.  
Got no diamonds, got no wealth.  
I got no men, but I got my health.

Each day through my window  
I watch him as he passes by.  
I say to myself, "What an incredible guy."  
To have a love like that  
Must surely be a dream come true.  
Out of all the women in the world,  
He belongs to only you.  
  
But it was just my imagination  
Runnin' away with me.  
It was just my imagination  
Runnin' away with me.  
  
Soon we'll be married  
And raise a family.  
A cozy little home out in the country  
With two kids or three.  
  
I tell you, I can visualize it all.  
This couldn't be a dream  
How real it all seems.  
  
Ohh, but it was just my imagination, once again  
Runnin' away with me.  
Tell you it was just my imagination  
Runnin' away with me.  
  
Every night on my knees I pray:  
Dear Lord, hear my plea.  
Don't ever let another take his love from me  
Or I will surely, surely die.  
  
His love is heavenly.  
When his arms enfold me  
I hear a tender rhapsody.  
But in reality  
He doesn't even know me.  
  
Once again  
Runnin' away with me.  
Ohh, just my imagination  
Runnin' away with me.  
  
It was just my imagination  
Runnin' away with me.  
It was just my imagination  
Running away with me.  
  
Just my imagination  
Runnin' away with me

Live at five and CNN  
Keep us all abreast  
Of breaking stories that can tend  
To make us anxious and depressed  
Problems with no answers  
Hang on like somechronic cough  
And every day some brand new issue  
Rears it's head to piss you off  
Bad guys win  
Optimism's wearing thin  
Things are spinning out of control  
Cynicism's all the fad  
World evens could make us mad  
As hatters  
Almost every day  
Some underpinning slips away  
These aren't laughing matters  
Time bombs tick  
People keep on getting sick  
And a nickel's not worth a cent  
Wickedness and greed abound  
Just as peace is gaining ground  
It shatters  
Hate is here to stay  
And justice goes to those who pay  
Friend, these aren't laughing matters  
The truth is scarier by far  
Than anything that Stephen King could write  
The stories in the paper are  
The daily small decline and fall  
Spelled out in black and white  
Oh, what to do, what to do?  
How to take a brighter view  
When your noodle's totally fried  
Human spirits need to be  
Leavened by a little levity  
So take those blues  
And bounce them off the wall  
Keep your humor please  
'Cause don't you know it's times like these that  
Laughing matters most of all  

Oh the weather outside is frightful,  
But the fire is so delightful,  
And since we've no place to go,  
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!  
  
It doesn't show signs of Pauseping,  
And I've bought some corn for popping,  
The lights are turned way down low,  
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!  
  
When we finally kiss goodnight,  
How I'll hate going out in the storm!  
But if you'll really hold me tight,  
All the way home I'll be warm.  
  
The fire is slowly dying,  
And, my dear, we're still good-bying,  
But as long as you love me so,  
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

let me call you sweetheart  
I'm in love with you  
Let me hear you whisper that you love me too  
Keep the lovelight glowing in your eyes so true  
Let me call you sweetheart

Let me call you sweetheart  
I'm in love with you  
Let me hear you whisper that you love me too  
Keep the lovelight glowing in your eyes so true  
Let me call you sweetheart  
I'm in love with you

And we'll have a real good time

Little lamb, little lamb  
My birthday is here at last  
Little lamb, little lamb  
My birthday goes by so fast  
Little bear, little bear  
You sit on my right, right there  
Little hen, little hen  
What game should we play and when?  
Little cat, little cat  
Oh, why do you look so blue?  
Did somebody paint you like that  
Or is your birthday too?  
Little fish, little fish  
Do you think I'll get my wish?  
Little lamb, little lamb  
I wonder how old I am  
I wonder how old I am  
Little lamb  

I know that I'm no saint.  
My head is in the clouds.  
They called you a mistake,  
But I still, I still say your name out loud.  
  
They called me a stupid girl,  
Just like my mom.  
Too many men passed through my arms.  
At seventeen I looked into your eyes,  
Knew I could never comfort your cries.  
Every April still reminds me of you.  
The child I never knew.  
My lullaby in blue.  
  
It all goes by so fast.  
How lovely you must be.  
Why you've reached the age at last  
That I was when your daddy lived with me.  
  
How I wish we could meet somewhere,  
Talk it through.  
There is so much I would say to you.  
There are others, I'm not alone.  
A younger brother you've never known,  
And a baby girl who so reminds me of you.  
The child I never knew.  
My lullaby in blue.  
  
As the years go by,  
Try not to think of us sadly.  
Believe it if you can,  
I want to see you so badly.  
On your birthday, Mama's thinking of you.  
The child I never knew.  
My lullaby in blue.  
My lullaby in blue.  
My lullaby

A boy went back to Napoli,  
because he missed the scenery,  
the native dancers and the charming songs.  
But wait a minute, something's wrong.  
  
Hey! Hey!  
Now it's hey Mambo, Mambo Italiano!  
Hey Mambo, Mambo Italiano!  
Go, go, Joe, you mixed up Sigiliano.  
All you Calabrese do the mambo like crazy.  
  
And hey Mambo! Don't want to tarantella,  
Hey Mambo! No more-a moozzarella.  
Hey Mambo! Hey Mambo Italiano.  
Try an enchilada with a fish-a-barcalada.  
  
Hey goombah!

But take-a some advice paisano,

If you're gonna be a square,  
you're never gonna go nowhere.

Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!  
  
Shake-a baby, shake-a,

Summer journeys to Niagra  
And to other places aggravate all our cares.  
We'll save our fares!  
I've a cozy little flat in  
What is known as old Manhattan  
We'll settle down  
Right here in town!  
We'll have Manhattan  
The Bronx and Staten Island too.  
It's lovely going through the zoo!  
(Sing to me, Bette, come on)  
It's very fancy  
on old Delancy street you know. (I know)  
The subway charms us so  
When balmy breezes blow  
To and fro.  
I'd like to take a  
Sail on Jamaica Bay with you,  
And fair Canarsie's Lakes we'll view.  
The city's bustle cannot destroy  
Oooh, the dreams of a girl and boy  
We'll turn Manhattan  
Into an isle of joy.  
Ooh, yeah  
And tell me what street  
compares with Mott Street in July?  
Sweet pushcarts gently gli-ding by.  
The great big city's a wonderous toy  
Ooh, just made for a girl and boy.  
We'll turn Manhattan into an isle of joy!  
We'll turn Manhattan into an isle of joy!

Why can't I forget like I should?  
Heaven knows I would if I could.  
But I just can't keep you off my mind.  
  
Though you're gone, I have to explain,  
All around me you still remain.  
Wonder why fate should be so unkind?  
  
Waking skies at sunrise,  
Every sunset, too,  
Seems to be bringing me  
Memories of you.  
  
Here and there, everywhere,  
Scenes that we once knew.  
And they all just recall  
Memories of you.  
  
How I wish I could forget  
Those happy yesteryears  
That have left  
A rosary of tears.  
  
Your face beams in my dreams  
Spite of all I do.  
Everything seems to bring  
Memories of you.  
Those memories of you.

Merry Christmas  
Have a very, very Merry Christmas  
Dream about your heart's desire  
Christmas Eve when you retire  
  
Santa Claus will stop  
And I know he'll drop  
Exactly what you wanted  
From your chimney top  
  
So be jolly, have a holiday as gay as holly  
May the ones you love be near you  
With the laugh of friends to cheer you  
  
When the church bells ring  
Like the angels sing  
And you hear the joyful hymn they chime  
  
Hang a wish from me on your Christmas tree  
For a very Merry Christmas time  
  
Merry Christmas

"Oh, hi! Is Miss Otis in?"  
"Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today,"  
  
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today, madam  
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today, mmm  
And she's sorry to be delayed  
But last evening down at lover's lane  
She strayed, madam  
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today  
  
When she woke up and found  
That her dream of love was gone, madam  
She ran to the man who had lead her so far astray  
And from under her velvet gown  
She drew a gun and shot her lover down, madam  
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today  
  
When the mob came and got her  
And dragged her from the jail, madam  
They strung her up on the willow across the way  
And the moment before she died  
She lifted up her lovely head and cried, madam  
  
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch  
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today

How 'bout a little bit, a little bit of moonlight dancin'  
Underneath the starry sky?  
How 'bout a little bit, a little bit of moonlight dancin'?  
Just the moon and you and i.  
Mmm, just the moon and you and i.  
Moonlight dancin', mmm, moonlight dancin'.  
  
How 'bout a little bit, a little bit of late night romance  
Underneath the starry sky?  
How 'bout a little bit, a little bit of late night romance?  
Just the moon and you and i.  
Mmm, just the moon and you and i.  
Moonlight dancin', mmm, moonlight dancin'.  
  
Ohh, nobody's gonna be there.  
Ohh, so don't you want to go where  
We could dance across the sky,  
Leave the world behind us?  
Nothin' that we couldn't do.  
Yeah, we could dance across the sky,  
Leave the world behind us.  
Just the moon and me and you.  
Mmm, just the moon and me and you.  
  
We could hide inside the rhythm  
'til the morning finds us.  
Share a little ecstasy.  
Yeah, we could hide inside the rhythm  
'til the morning finds us.  
If you come away with me  
I'll show you how it feels to be  
Moonlight dancin'. mmm, moonlight dancin'.  
  
Oh, we gonna sail on the wind.  
Oh, so don't you want to begin?  
  
Moonlight dancing, mmm, moonlight dancing.  
How 'bout a little bit, a little bit?  
How 'bout a little bit, a little bit of moonlight dancin'?  
Just the moon and you and i.  
Moonlight dancin, mmm, moonlight dancing.  
Ooooh, ahhh . . .

Diamonds, roses, I need Moses  
To cross this sea of loneliness,  
Part this red river of pain.  
I don't necessarily buy  
Any key to the future or happiness  
But I need a little place in the sun sometimes  
Or I think I'll die.  
  
And everywhere is somewhere but nowhere is near.  
Everybody's got somebody with their wine and their beer.  
But I'm a tragic figure in the corner over here  
With an empty apartment and a best friend who is queer. Heh.  
  
Every time I see him he smiles  
And tells me how well he's walking these miles.  
But he never ever asks a single thing about me.  
If I died he'd hear about it eventually.  
Diamonds, roses, I need Moses  
To cross this sea of loneliness,  
Part this red river of pain. Ohhh.  
  
'Cause everywhere is somewhere and nowhere is near.  
Everybody's got somebody with their wine and their beer.  
And I'm a tragic figure in the corner over here  
With my bills in the mailbox and some checks that won't clear this year.  
  
Everywhere is somewhere and nowhere is near.  
Everybody's got somebody with their wine and their beer.  
So I'm just a tragic figure in the corner over here  
Who'll sleep it off 'til morning and still not know that we're,  
  
We're all just diamonds and roses. I need Moses  
To cross this sea of loneliness, part this red river of pain.  
To cross this sea of loneliness, part this red river of pain.  
To cross this sea of loneliness, part this red river of pain.

"May I help you?"  
"Yeah, it's me again. Did you get him on the line yet?  
Oh, this is awful. I've been trying to get him all day  
No, it's okay. I'll wait."  
  
Mr. Rockefeller, how are you?  
Mr. Rockefeller, having fun?  
Mr. Rockefeller I could use a few  
If you'd like to send a few down my way.  
  
Mr. Rockefeller, I get my magazines,  
I see you on the TV too, yeah.  
Mr. Rockefeller, they tell me, they tell me all about it,  
But they don't tell me how are you.  
  
Sometimes I think I know you,  
Sometimes I think I don't.  
Sometimes I think we'll make it,  
Sometimes I think we won't.  
  
Waiting on the wire,  
And I'm ragged to the bone.  
Mr. Rockefeller won't you  
Please pick up the phone?  
  
The reason I'm calling is to say  
I'm not feeling so good.  
I'm all broken down.  
  
My family is nervous and my thoughts are blue.  
But I want to know, I gotta know,  
I'm askin' everybody, how are you?  
  
Please, won't you answer me?  
Won't you take the time?  
The next call's got to be collect,  
Cause this is my last dime.  
Waiting on the wire,  
And I'm ragged to the bone.  
Mr. Rockefeller, please pick up the phone.  
  
Mr. Rockefeller, how are you?

Mr. Rockefeller, wouldn't it be nice?  
Mr. Rockefeller

Why this feeling? Why this glow?  
Why the thrill when you say hello?  
It's a strange and tender magic you do.  
Mister Wonderful, that's you.  
Why this trembling when you speak?  
Why this joy when you touch my cheek?  
I must tell you what my heart knows is true.  
Mister Wonderful, that's you.  
  
And why this longing to know your charms?  
To spend forever here in your arms?  
  
Oh, there's much more I could say,  
But the words keep slipping away,  
And I'm left with one point of view.  
Mister Wonderful, that's you.  
  
One more thing, then I'm through.  
Mister Wonderful,  
Mister Wonderful,  
Mister Wonderful, I love you!

Your hair's so fair, your eye's so dark  
I love you hard as my life  
You pass me by as though I were a stone  
You cut me like a knife  
  
Boy, I do. I got my eye on you  
Got my eye on you  
  
I'm walking down by the water's edge  
Feel like I'm coming apart  
I'm so afraid of this jealous rage  
That's taken hold of my heart  
  
And, boy, I do. I got my eye on you  
Boy, I do. I got my eye on you  
  
Boy! Now I, I've reached the end  
End of the line  
Baby, here's a kiss  
To remember me by!  
  
Boy, I do. I got my eye on you  
My eye on you  
  
I had a dream I was dressed in white  
The witness swears on the stand  
They caught me cryin' in the street last night  
The gun was still in my hand  
  
And, Boy, I do. I got my eye on you  
Boy, I do. I got my eye on you  
Got my eye on you!  
My eye on you!  
My eye on you  
My eye on you  
My eye on you  
My eye on you  
My eye on you  
My eye on you  
My eye on you  
Yes, I do, babe  
My eye on you

I'm a hot blonde and it was a cold night  
This is my story. I ain't ashamed to tell it  
I was hungry, tired and lookin' for love  
  
I was just a pilgrim in the hot pursuit of love  
Wandered from disco to disco  
That's all my life was  
Suddenly you danced up against me  
It felt warm and smooth  
I knew in an instant  
That you were my moment of darkest truth  
  
Oh, my knight in black leather  
Hold me tight and love me forever  
Rings on your fingers, love in your heart  
Knight in black leather, we'll never part  
  
Only you can shine the light  
On the dark side of my mind  
And your evil sweetness  
Leaves a trail of lovers behind  
When you crush me to your heart  
I feel just like a queen  
I'm a willing victim  
Tell me, all my life where have you been?  
  
Oh, my knight in black leather  
Hold me tight and love me forever  
Rings on your fingers, love in your heart  
Knight in black leather, we'll never part, haaa  
  
Oh, my knight in black leather  
Take me down and love me forever  
Walk on through the halls of my soul  
Knight in black leather  
And you've got control  
Oh, don't ya know, baby?  
  
You're my knight!  
See'mon and love me forever!  
Rings on your fingers, love on demand  
Knight in black leather  
Oh, you've got command  
And how I love ya, baby  
  
Whoa, my knight!  
Sweet, sweet knight!  
You know that I love you, I love you, love you!  
We'll never pa-aa-aa-aa-aa-aart!  
  
(We're the knights in black leather  
And we will chain you down  
And love you forever  
Walk on through the halls of your soul  
Yeah, the knights in black leather  
We're in controoool!)  
  
You know he smells just like a brand new car  
'Cause everything he owns is leather!  
A leather shirt, leather hat  
Leather gloves, leather spats  
Leather chaps, leather pants  
Leather socks, leather cap  
Leather coat! leather wrap!  
Leather neck! leather ring!  
Leather thing!!!!  
  
We'll never pa-aa-aa-aart!  
Oh, my knight in black leather!  
Take us down! Love me honey, come on, love me!  
You got to hold me, hold me!  
We'll never pa-aa-aa-aa-aa-aa-aa-aa-aa-aa-aart!  
Whoa-oh-ooo-oh-oh!...

"I think I'll sing you a little ballad  
It's a new one. I just learnt it. oh, I hope you like it."  
Got my mother's eyes and my father's hair  
Does anybody really care?  
It's gettin' cold out here  
  
Well, I keep walkin' with my head held high  
With my head to the sky  
With my mother's eyes  
  
And my mother's eyes are with me  
In the darkness that's been paid for  
I'm just a nameless stranger, don't know why  
  
Have I seen all that I could?  
Have I seen more than I should  
With my mother's eyes?  
  
And my mother's eyes are with me  
In the chilly winds of autumn  
If I ain't here by winter, she'll know why  
  
I've seen all that I dare  
I've seen more than my share  
Forgive me if I stare with my mother's eyes

And now, is it too late to say  
How you made my life so different in your quiet way?  
I can see the joy in simple things,  
A sunlit sky and all the songs we used to sing.  
  
I have walked and I have I prayed.  
I could forgive and we could start again.  
In the end,  
You are my one true friend.  
  
For all, all the times you closed your eyes,  
Allowing me to stumble or to be surprised,  
By life, with all it's twists and turns.  
I made mistakes, you always knew that I would learn.  
  
And when I left, it's you who stayed.  
You always knew that I'd come home again.  
In the end,  
You are my one true friend.  
  
Though love may break, it never dies.  
It changes shape, through changing eyes.  
What I denied, I now can see.  
You always were the light inside of me.  
  
I know, I know, I know, I know it was you.  
  
I have walked and I have I prayed.  
I could forgive and we could start again.  
In the end, you are my one true friend.  
  
My one true friend.  
I always, always knew,  
I always knew that it was you,  
My one true friend.

Maybe you and I see life with two different visions  
And neither one of us is wrong or right  
Maybe we're too serious and don't want to listen  
I just want to make you laugh tonight  
We are like  
Day and night  
Night and day  
We are both so different in so many ways  
We are like  
Night and day  
Day and night  
And we go together just like black and white  
Seems you're always out one door when I'm in the other  
It's so hard to find some quiet time  
I wish that we could spend our lives alone with each other  
And never think about the world outside  
We are like day and night  
Night and day  
We are oh so different in so many ways  
We are like  
Night and day  
Day and night  
Still we know it's gonna be alright  
And if we never really get the picture right  
How many of us ever really win the fight?  
I never wanna lose your love or let the distance get the best of us  
'Cause time is moving fast enough.  
Maybe we don't always share a common opinion  
It's true that you and I don't think alike  
But when I look into your eyes and all is forgiven  
All I wanna do is hold you tight  
We are like day and night  
Night and day  
We are both so different in so many ways  
We are like  
Night and day  
Day and night  
Still we know it's gonna be alright  
We are like night and day  
Day and night  
And we go together just like black and white  
We are like, we are like, we are like day and night  
Night and day  
Day and night  
Night and day  
We are like, we are like, we are like day and night  
Night and day  
Night...  
Black and white.  

My momma says that I must leave him alone.

Who loves me even though I'm crazy  
And nothing that I say is true?  
Who won my heart and soul forever?  
It's nobody else but  
Nobody else but...  
  
Each time I feel I'm out to pasture  
Who always makes me feel brand new?  
I'm pledging my allegiance baby  
To nobody else but  
Nobody else but...  
  
Look at me, laughing out lou  
Trying to remember all the jokes that you taught me  
When you see the light in my eyes  
It's only a reflection of the joy that you brought me  
  
How did I get to be so happy?  
I've wondered that my whole life through, yeah  
I thank my lucky stars for sending me  
Nobody else but, nobody else but  
Nobody else but you

I always knew I had an angel  
A voice that told me what to do, yeah  
But now that angel's on my shoulder  
It's nobody else but, nobody else but  
Nobody else but you

[Harlettes]  
She called up the doctor  
To see what's the matter  
He said: "Come on over."  
  
[Bette]  
I said: "Do I have to?"  
My knees started aching  
My wrists started shakin'  
When the doctor said to me...  
  
"Whoa," he said  
"Oh, my, my, oh, my, my,  
Can you boogie? Can you slide?  
Oh, my, my, oh, my, my,  
You can boogie if you try  
Oh, my, my, oh, my, my,  
You know it's guaranteed to keep you alive."  
  
"Whoa, no, no, no, no, no!  
Now don't make me go!"  
  
[Harlettes]  
The head nurse - she blew in  
Just like a tornado  
When they started dancin'...  
  
[Bette]  
I jumped off the table  
I felt myself reeling  
And as I was healing  
This is what he said to me:  
  
"Ow! Oh, my, my, oh, my, my  
Can you boogie? Can you slide?  
Oh, my, my, oh, my, my  
You can boogie if you try  
Oh, my, my, oh, my, my  
You know it's guaranteed to keep you alive"  
  
[Harlettes]  
Can you boogie?  
  
[Bette]  
Whoa, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my  
Can I boogie? Can I boogie?  
Can I boogie? Can I boogie woogie?  
  
[Harlettes]  
Can you boogie?  
  
[Bette]  
Yes, I can  
Yes, I can  
Yes, I can  
  
[Harlettes]  
Can you boogie?  
  
[Bette]  
Yes, I can

[Harlettes]  
Can you boogie?  
  
[Bette]  
Yes, I can  
Yes, I can  
Yes, I can  
  
"Can I boogie?  
Can I boogie?  
What kind of asshole question is that?"

If you're fond of sand dunes and salty air,  
Quaint little villages here and there,  
You're sure to fall in love with old cape cod.  
  
If you like the taste of a lobster stew  
Served by a window with an ocean view,  
You're sure to fall in love with old cape cod.  
  
Winding roads that seem to beckon you.  
Miles of green beneath the skies of blue.  
Church bells chimin' on a Sunday morn  
Remind you of the town where you were born.  
  
If you spend an evening you'll want to stay,  
Watching the moonlight on old cape cod bay.  
You're sure to fall in love with old cape cod.  
  
You're sure to fall in love, in love, in love.  
You're sure to fall in love, in love,  
With old cape cod, old cape cod.

Hey, nice piano playin', Manilla  
Thank you, Miss M  
Whatcha doin' these days?  
Makin' records  
  
Really?  
Yes, really  
Do you still play piano for people?  
Well, depends on who  
  
Hmm, I'm gonna get you  
On a slow boat to China  
All to myself alone  
  
Get you and keep you  
In my arms evermore  
Leave all the others  
Waitin' on a faraway shore  
  
Out on the briny  
Where the moon's  
Big and shiny  
Meltin' your heart of stone  
  
I'm gonna get you  
On a slow boat to China  
All to myself alone  
  
Bette, I didn't know  
You felt that way about me  
I don't, I need a piano player  
Ah, just like the old days  
You're not gonna change keys  
On me are yah? Uh huh, oh  
  
I'm gonna get you  
(You're never gonna get me)  
On a slow boat to China  
(Not in a fast or slow boat at any crick)  
All to myself alone  
(I just get motion sick)  
  
I'm gonna make you mine  
(Ha, you'll have to stand in line)  
Get you and keep you  
In my band evermore  
(Now there's a new attack)  
  
Leave all the others on the shore  
(For me they'd swim to China)  
(To China and back)  
  
Out on the briny  
(I wouldn't like the ocean)  
Where the moon's big and shiny  
(Not even in a rowboat)  
  
Melting your heart of stone  
Come on what do yah say?  
(You always get your way)  
  
I'm gonna get you  
On a slow boat to China  
All to myself alone, together  
All to myself alone

Johnny: "okay. and once again, here's bette midler."  
  
Bette: "well, you know, when they asked me to come on and. .. I can't believe
it! The last, the last guest. The last fool mr. Carson will have to suffer
gladly. You are the wind beneath m  
Gs. Oh, well he is. "  
  
Quarter to three. There's no one in the place  
Except you and me.  
So set 'em up, joe. Got a little story  
I think you should know.  
  
We're drinkin', my friend, to the end  
Of a sweet episode.  
Make it one for my baby  
And one more for the road.  
  
Got the routine. So drop another nickel  
In the machine.  
Oh, gee, I'm feelin' so bad. Wish you'd make the music  
So dreamy and sad.  
  
You could tell me a lot. But it's not  
In a gentleman's code.  
Let's make it one for my baby  
And one more for the road.  
  
You may not know it,  
But buddy you're a kind of poet.  
And you've had a lot of things to say.  
And when I'm gloomy  
You always listen to me,  
Until it's talked away.  
  
Well, that's how it goes.  
And john I know you're getting  
Anxious to close.  
So, thanks for the cheer.  
I hope you didn't mind me  
Bending your ear.  
  
For all of the years,  
For the laughs, for the tears,  
For the class that you showed,  
Make it one for my baby  
And one more for the road.  
That long long road.  
  
Johhny: "thank you, bette. ah."

Strength that living can bring.

When my teeth are rinsed in a glass by my bed,  
And my hair lies somewhere in a drawer,  
You know, the world doesn't seem like a very nice place,  
Not a very nice place anymore.  
  
But I put in my teeth, and I slap on my hair  
And a strange thing occurs when I do,  
My teeth start to feel like my very own teeth  
And my hair like my very own too.  
  
And I'm ready to begin again.  
Ready to begin again.  
Reachin' for the soap,  
My heart is full o' hope  
Again, again.  
  
Ready to begin again!  
Looking fresh and bright I trust.  
Ready to begin again,  
As everybody must.

I read that it's all black and white  
Oooh, the spectrum made a shade I like!

Bobby's driving through the city tonight,  
Through the lights in a hot new rent-a-car.  
He joins the lovers in his heavy machine.  
It's a scene down on sunset boulevard.  
Say goodbye to hollywood.  
Say goodbye, my baby.  
Say goodbye to hollywood.  
Say goodbye, my baby.  
Johnny's taking care of things for a while,  
And his style is so right for troubadours.  
They caught him standing with his face to the door,  
Now he won't be my fast gun anymore.  
Say goodbye to hollywood.  
Say goodbye, my baby.  
Say goodbye to hollywood.  
Say goodbye, my baby.  
Moving on is a chance that you take  
Anytime you try to stay together.  
Whoa-oa-ho-ho-hoo.  
Say a word out of line  
And you find the friends you had are gone forever, forever.  
So many faces in and out of my life.  
Some will last,  
Some will just be now and then.  
Life is a series of hellos and goodbyes.  
I'm afraid it's time for goodbye again.  
Say goodbye to hollywood.  
Say goodbye, my baby.  
Say goodbye to hollywood.  
Say goodbye to hollywood.  
Say goodbye to hollywood.  
Say goodbye, my baby.  
Yeah, say goodbye.  
Yeah, say goodbye.  
Yeah, he's gotta say goodbye.  
He's gotta say goodbye.  
He's gotta say goodbye.  
Say goodbye.  
Yeah, say goodbye,  
Say goodbye, say goodbye.  
You gotta say goodbye.  
Say goodbye, say good bye, say goodbye . . .  

Well I'm leaving my family  
I'm leaving all my friends  
My body's at home  
But my heart's in the wind  
And the clouds are like headlines  
Upon a new front page sky  
My tears are salt water  
The moon's full and high  
  
And I know Joe Conrad would be proud of me  
Many before me been called by the sea  
To be up in the crow's nest singing my saying  
Shiver me timbers let's all sail away  
  
And the fog lifting  
The sand shifting  
I'm drifting on out  
Old Captain Ahab got nothing on me  
Swallow me, don't follow me  
I'm traveling alone  
The water's my daughter  
I skip like a stone  
  
And the fog lifting  
The sand shifting  
I'm drifting on out  
Old Captain Ahab got nothing on me  
Swallow me, don't follow me  
I'm traveling alone  
The water's my daughter  
I skip like a stone  
  
Won't you please call my family  
Tell them not to cry  
My goodbyes are written  
By the moon in the sky  
Say nobody knows me  
I've got no reason to stay  
Shiver me timbers  
I'm sailing away  
  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

[Both:] Sisters, sisters,  
There were never such devoted sisters.  
Never had to have a chaperone, no sir.  
[Linda:] I'm here to keep my eye on her.  
  
[Both:] Caring, sharing  
Every little thing that we are wearing.  
When a certain gentleman arrived from Rome,  
[Bette:] she wore the dress and I stayed home.  
  
[Both:] All kinds of weather, we stick together,  
The same in the rain or sun.  
Two different faces, but in tight places  
We think and we act as one. Uh-huh!  
  
Those who've seen us  
Know that not a thing can come between us.  
Many men have tried to split us up, but no one can.  
Lord help the mister who comes between me and my sister,  
And Lord help the sister that comes between me and my man.

Sisters!  
Don't you come  
Between me and my man!

Skylark, have you anything to say to me?  
Can you tell me where my love may be?  
Is there a meadow in the mist  
Where he's just waiting to be kissed?  
  
Skylark, have you seen a valley green with spring  
Where my heart can go a journeying  
Over the shadows and the rain  
To a blossom covered lane?  
  
And in your lonely flight have you heard the music?  
In the night, wonderful music.  
Faint as a will-o'-the-wisp, crazy as a loon,  
Sad as a gypsy serenading the moon.  
  
Oh, skylark, i don't know, i don't know  
If you can find these things,  
But my heart, my heart is riding on your wings.  
So if you see them anywhere  
Won't you lead me there?  
  
Oh, won't you lead me there?  
Lead me there, lead me there.  
Lead me there, skylark, skylark, skylark, there!

Drive me home silver eagle.  
Drive me away from last night's news.  
Empty beds, crowds of people.  
Oh, come on, white girl, sing the blues.  
  
Warm mister, hold me like you love me.  
Why don't you make me  
Feel real good for free?  
And if free don't mean for nothin',  
Let's just say this one's on me, yeah!  
  
You know I sold my soul to rock 'n' roll.  
I bought these devil chains.  
My baby wants me home. Can't refuse him.  
Sold my soul to rock 'n' roll.  
It's time to take that train.  
The one that goes from heaven  
Straight to Houston, ho.  
  
Whoa, I need a short vacation,  
Restin' in my baby's arms.  
But the road goes on  
Forever, forever, forever.  
It keeps on going,  
But I'm gone, gone, gone.  
  
Sold my soul to rock 'n' roll.  
Bought these devil chains.  
Whoa, baby wants me home. Can't refuse him.  
I sold my soul to rock 'n' roll.  
It's time to take that train.  
The one that goes from heaven  
Straight to Houston, ho.  
  
Did you like it?  
Was it good?  
Don't it make you want to cry-hi-hi?  
Did you like it?  
Oh! Am I good?  
Is it worth another try-y-y?  
Aaaaaaa!!!!  
  
Sold my soul to rock 'n' roll.  
It's time to take that train.  
The one that goes from heaven  
Straight to Houston, ho.  
The one that goes from heaven  
Straight to Houston, ho.

Some people's lives run down like clocks.  
One day they stop, and that's all they've got.  
Some lives wear out like old tennis shoes  
no one can use. Well, It's sad but it's true.  
  
Didn't anybody tell them?  
Didn't anybody see?  
Didn't anybody love them  
like you love me?  
  
Some people's lives fade like their dreams,  
too tired to rise, too tired to sleep.  
Some people laugh when they need to cry,  
and they never know why.  
  
Didn't anybody tell them  
that's not how it used to be?  
Didn't anybody love them  
like you love me?  
  
Some people ask if the tears have to fall.  
Then why take your chances? Why bother at all?  
And some people's lives are as cold as their lips.  
They just need to be kissed.  
  
Doesn't anybody tell them?  
Doesn't anybody see?  
Doesn't anybody love them  
like you love me?  
'Cause that's all they need.

I used to walk with you  
Along the avenue  
Our hearts were carefree and gay  
How could I know I'd lose you  
Somewhere along the way?  
The friends we used to know  
Would always smile hello  
"No love like our love", they'd say  
Then love slipped through our fingers  
Somewhere along the way  
I should forget  
But with the loneliness of night  
I start remembering  
Everything  
You're gone and yet  
There's still a feeling deep inside  
That you will always be  
Part of me  
So now I look for you  
Along the avenue  
And as I wander I pray  
That someday soon I'll find you  
Somewhere along the way  
Somewhere along the way

Ooooooh. Wooooh.  
Strangers in the night, exchanging glances,  
Wondering in the night what were the chances  
We would fall in love before the night was through.  
  
Something in your eyes was so exciting,  
And in your smile, ooh, inviting.  
In my heart I knew I must have you.  
  
Strangers in the night, lonely people.  
Strangers in the night up to the moment  
We said our first hello. Little did we know  
Love was just a glance away, embracing dance away.  
It's just a glance away. It's just a chance away.  
  
Dancin', dancin' in the night. Stranger,  
C'mon, c'mon, treat a stranger right.  
I'm dancin', dancin' in the night. Stranger,  
I say what's on my mind.  
Let us be lovers. Yeah, it's gonna be all right  
For strangers in the . . .  
  
Yeah, woo-hoo!  
I'm dancin', dancin' in the night.  
Hello stranger. see'mon, whoa.  
Dancin', I'm dancin' in the night. Hello stranger.  
Woo. I'm dancin' in the night. Hello stranger.  
Oh-wo. Ohhhh.  
  
Doo-be-doo-be-doo. Don't want to be  
Doo-be-doo-be-doo. Don't want to be strangers.  
No, Doo-be-doo-be-doo. Don't want to be  
Doo-be-doo-be-doo. Don't want to be strangers.  
Doo-be-doo-be-doo. Don't want to be  
Doo-be-doo-be-doo. Don't want to be strangers.  
No, no, nooo, don't want to be strangers.  
No. Strangers. Woo!

Long ago and oh, so far away  
I fell in love with you  
Before the second show  
  
Your guitar, it sounds so sweet and clear  
But you're not really here  
It's just the radio  
  
Don't you remember you told me you loved me baby?  
Said you'd be coming back this way again maybe?  
Baby, baby, baby, baby oh baby  
I love you, I really do  
  
Loneliness is such a sad affair  
And I can hardly wait  
To sleep with you again  
  
What to say to make you come again  
Come back to me again  
And play your sad guitar  
  
Don't you remember you told me you loved me baby?  
Said you'd be coming back this way again maybe?  
Baby, baby, baby, baby oh baby  
I love you, I really do

I was young, I was just sixteen then  
When you came up from Burma one day  
And you told me to pack up my suitcase  
And I did, and you took me away  
I said, "Do you work nice and steady  
Or do you go sailing and roving out to sea?"  
And you said, "I have a job on the railroad  
And baby, how swell it's all gonna be"  
You said a lot, Johnny. It was all lies  
You sure had me fooled, right from the start  
I hate you when you laugh at me like that  
Take that pipe out of your mouth, Johnny  
  
Surabaya Johnny. Is it really the end?  
Surabaya Johnny. Will the hurt ever mend?  
Surabaya Johnny. Ooh, I burn at your touch  
You got no heart, Johnny, but oh, I love you so much  
  
Oh, at first you were kind and gentle  
'Til I packed up and went off with you  
And it lasted two weeks until one day  
You laughed at me and hit me too  
You dragged me all over the city  
Up the river and down to the sea  
Now I look at myself in the mirror  
And some old woman looks back at me  
You didn't want love, Johnny, you wanted money  
I gave you all I had. You wanted more  
Oh, don't look at me that way  
I'm only trying to talk to you  
Wipe that grin off your face, Johnny  
  
Surabaya Johnny. Is it really the end?  
Surabaya Johnny. Will the pain never mend?  
Surabaya Johnny. How I burn at your touch  
You got no heart, Johnny, but oh, I love you so much  
  
When we met I forgot to ask you  
Why they called you that funny name  
But in every hotel on the seacoast  
I found out, and I loved you all the same  
I'm tired. I'm worn out  
The sea's pounding in my ears  
And I reach out my arms to hold you  
You're not here and who even cares?  
You got no heart, Johnny. You're just no good  
You going now? Oh, tell me why  
I love you after all, Johnny, like that very first day  
Don't laugh at me no more, Johnny.  
  
Surabaya Johnny. Is it really the end?  
Surabaya Johnny. Will the hurt ever mend?  
Surabaya Johnny. Oh, I burn at your touch  
You got no heart, Johnny, but oh, I love you  
I love you, I love you so much

That's how heartaches are made.  
That's how heartaches are made.  
  
They told me I was such a fool to love you.  
They said that you're the kind who'd never be true.  
Pretty soon the day would come when I'd be the sorry one.  
But I said that I'm not afraid.  
  
[Chorus]  
Well, that's how heartaches are made.  
That's how heartaches are made.  
  
I went ahead and my heart opened the door.  
I gave you so much love. No one could love more.  
You pretended to be mine. How could you be so unkind,  
With all the other girls you play?  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
I know you're not sincere and you'll never be.  
But still I want those kisses so desperately.  
I could never let you go, baby even though I know  
Every rule in love you disobeyed.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
That's how heartaches are made. [Repeat: x3]

Oooooh. Oooh-hoooh.  
Ooooo-hoooh.  
It's such a mystery  
How he found something in me  
That I never knew was there.  
He uncovered it so easily.  
He turned me like a season  
And I began to change.  
He wrapped himself all around me,  
Now I'll never be the same.  
  
That's how love works.  
That's how love moves.  
Like a river running through you.  
Sometimes it lifts you  
As high as Heaven.  
It consumes you, that's a given.  
That's how love moves.  
Ohh, that's how love moves.  
  
I've seen walls that could never be broken  
Come a-tumblin' down, oh yes I have.  
I've heard the voice of love calling  
Without making a sound.  
See, I was touched by an angel  
The day he took my hand.  
I know that he's the miracle  
That makes me eveything I am.  
  
That's how love works.  
That's how love moves.  
Like a river running through you.  
Sometimes it lifts you  
As high as Heaven.  
It consumes you, that's a given.  
That's how love moves.  
Ohh, that's how love moves.  
Woah, love.  
  
Sometimes it's a whisper,  
Oh, sometimes it's a storm,  
Sometimes it reaches forever  
With it's everlasting arms.  
  
That's how love works.  
That's how love moves.  
Like a river running through you.  
Sometimes it lifts you  
High as Heaven.  
It consumes you, yeah, that's a given.  
  
Ohhhhhhh!  
That's how love works.  
That's how love moves.  
Like a river, yeah, like a river  
Running through you, running through your heart and soul.  
Sometimes it lifts you  
As high as Heaven.  
Heaven!  
It consumes you, that's a given.  
  
That's how love works. That's how love works.  
That's how love moves. That's how love moves.  
Like a river running through you. Like a river running through your heart and
soul.  
Sometimes it lifts you  
As high as Heaven. Heaven!  
It consumes you, that's a given.  
That's how love moves.  
  
That's how love moves.  
That's how love moves.  
That's how love moves.  
That's how, that's how, that's how.  
That's how love moves.  
That's how love moves.

This ole house once knew my children.  
This ole house once knew my life.  
This ole house was home and comfort  
as we lived through storm and strife.  
This ole house once rang with laughter.  
This ole house heard many shouts.  
Now she trembles in the darkness  
When the lightning walks about.  
  
Ain't a-gonna need this house no longer.  
Ain't a-gonna need this house no more.  
Ain't got time to fix the shingles.  
Ain't got time to fix the floor.  
Ain't got time to oil the hinges,  
nor to mend the window panes.  
Ain't a-gonna need this house no longer.  
I'm a-gettin' ready to meet the saints.  
  
This ole house is gettin' shaky.  
This ole house is gettin' old.  
This ole house lets in the rain.  
This ole house lets in the cold.  
On my knees I'm gettin' shaky,  
but I feel no fear or pain,  
Cause I see an angel peekin'  
Through a broken window pane.  
  
I ain't a-gonna need this house no longer.  
Ain't a-gonna need this house no more.  
Ain't got time to fix the shingles.  
Ain't got time to fix the floor.  
I ain't got time to oil the hinges,  
nor to mend the window panes.  
Ain't a-gonna need this house no longer.  
I'm a-gettin' ready to meet the saints.  
  
This ole house is afraid of thunder.  
This ole house is afraid of storms.  
This ole house just groans and trembles  
when the night wind flings its arms.  
This ole house is gettin' feeble.  
This old house is needin' paint.  
Just like me it's tuckered out,  
But I'm a-gettin' ready to meet the saints.  
  
Ain't a-gonna need this house no longer.  
Ain't a-gonna need this house no more.  
Ain't got time to fix the shingles.  
Ain't got time to

You've been down in the dumps  
It seems like forever.  
Now, what have they done to you?  
Not a single thing's turned out  
The way you imagined.  
It all looks unreachable to you.  
  
You don't know for the life of you  
What is missing,  
Or why it always happens to you.  
And you don't like yourself,  
You feel nobody's listening.  
You don't need another platitude.  
  
For a moment you forget  
And a smile comes to your face.  
Aah, but it doesn't last too long.  
It's like a string you got tied  
Around your finger  
Reminding you of  
Everything that's wrong.  
  
I won't try to say I know what you're feeling.  
I won't try to second guess you.  
I won't try to give advice you won't be needing.  
I'm only here to comfort you.  
I'm only here to comfort you.  
  
And I'd love to be the reason  
A smile comes to your face,  
Even if it doesn't last too long.  
And I'd love to take that string  
You've got tied around your finger  
Reminding you of everything that's wrong.  
  
I won't try to say I know what you're feeling.  
I won't try to second guess you.  
I won't try to give advice you won't be needing.  
I'm only here to comfort you.  
I'm only here to comfort you.  
I'm only here to comfort you.

"How ya doin' girls? Long time, no see.  
Listen, I've been to the doctor lately.  
Honey, I just spent forty dollars to hear that from that guy?"  
  
My analyst told me  
That I was right out of my head.  
The way he described it he said,  
"You'd be better off dead than alive."  
I didn't listen to his jive.  
I knew all along he was all wrong,  
And I knew that he thought I was crazy,  
But you know I'm not. Oh, no.  
  
My analyst told me  
That I was right out of my head.  
He said I need treatment.  
But I'm not that easily led.  
He said I was the type that was most inclined  
When out of his sight  
To be out of my mind.  
And he thought I was nuts.  
No more if's or and's or but's.  
Oh, no.  
  
They say as a child I appeared a little bit wild  
With all my crazy ideas.  
But I knew what was happenin',  
I knew I was a genius.  
What's so strange when you know that  
You're a wizard at three?  
I said, "Baby, this is meant for me, me, me, me."  
  
I heard little children were supposed to sleep tight.  
That's why I drank a fifth of vodka one night.  
My parent's got frantic, didn't know what to do.  
But I had saw some crazy things  
Before I came to.  
Now, do you think I was crazy?  
I may have been only three but I was swingin'.  
  
They all laughed at A. Graham Bell,  
They all laughed at Edison,  
And also at Einstein.  
So why should I feel sorry if they just  
Didn't understand the reasoning and the logic  
That went on in my head.  
I had a brain, it was insane.  
So I just let them laugh at me  
When I refused to ride on all those double-decker buses  
All because there was no driver on the top.  
Aaaaaaah.  
  
"Did you ever hear a story like that in your life?  
Honey, that chick is bananas. Do you hear?  
Bananas. Oh, waiter, bring me another banana dacquari, would ya?"  
Ba, ba, ba, ba!  
"Oh, here she comes again."  
Badada, badada, badada. Wo!  
  
My analyst told me  
That I was right out of my head.  
But I said, "Doctor,  
I think that it's you instead.  
'Cause I got a thing that's so unique and new,  
It proves that I got the last laugh on you.  
'Cause instead of one head, ooh, I got two.  
And you know two heads are better than one."  
  
"Honey, she is twisted"

A do-dooooo. A do-dooooo.  
I saw the splendor of the moonlight on Honolulu Bay.  
There's something tender in the moonlight on Honolulu Bay.  
And all the beaches are full of peaches  
Who bring their ukes along.  
And in the glimmer of the moonlight  
They love to sing this song.  
  
If you like a ukulele lady,  
Ukulele lady like a you.  
If you want to linger where it's shady,  
Ukulele lady linger too.  
If you kiss a ukulele lady  
While you promise ever to be true,  
And she see another ukulele lady fool around with you.  
Maybe she'll sigh, maybe she'll cry,  
Maybe she'll find somebody else  
By and by-why-why  
To sing to when it's cool and shady,  
Where the tricky wicky wackies woo woo woo.  
If you like a ukulele lady,  
Ukulele lady like a you.  
  
Someday I'm goin'  
Where eyes are glowin'  
And lips were made to kiss,  
To see somebody in the moonlight  
And hear the songs I missed.  
  
If you like a ukulele lady,  
Ukulele lady like a you, you, you.  
If you want to linger where it's shady,  
Ukulele lady linger too.  
If you kiss a ukulele lady  
While you promise ever to be true true, true,  
And she see another ukulele lady fool around with you.  
Well, maybe she will sigh, maybe she will cry,  
Aah, but maybe she will find somebody else  
By and by-why-why  
To sing to when it's cool and shady,  
Where the tricky wicky wackies woo woo woo.  
If you like a ukulele lady,  
Ukulele lady like a you like a me like I like a you  
We like a both the same.  
I'd like to say this very day  
Ukulele lady like a you-ooo-oooo.  
Laughing

Oh, oh, the sun beats down  
And burns the tar up off the roof  
And your shoes get so hot  
You wish your tired feet were fireproof  
Under the boardwalk, down by the sea  
On a blanket with my baby is where I'll be  
  
From the park you hear  
Happy sounds from the carousel  
You can almost taste the hot dogs  
And french fries they sell  
Under the boardwalk, down by the sea  
On a blanket with my baby is where I'll be  
  
Out of the sun  
We'll be havin' some fun  
People walkin' above  
We'll be fallin' in love  
Under the boardwalk, boardwalk  
  
Oh, la la la la la la  
Oh, la la la la la la la la la  
Help me somebody, sing some la las with me  
Under the night, under the stars  
By the raging sea  
  
Under the boardwalk, down by the sea  
On a blanket with my baby is where I'll be  
On a blanket with my baby is where I'll be  
  
Out of the sun  
We'll be havin' some fun  
People walkin', walkin'  
We'll be falling in love  
  
Out of the sun  
We'll be havin' some fun  
Everybody walkin', walkin', walkin'  
We'll be under the boardwalk, boardwalk

Come with me, come with me  
And we shall run across the sky.  
We illuminate the night.  
Ohhhh, I, I will try and guide you  
To better times and brighter days.  
Just don't be afraid.  
  
Come on up the ladder to the roof  
Where we can see heaven much better.  
Let's go up the ladder to the roof  
Where we can be closer to heaven.  
  
Stay with me, stay with me  
And we shall let expression sing.  
Hear freedom ringin'.  
Ohhh, memories of yesterday's broken dreams.  
Hey, don't you know, don't you know  
That they are gonna fade away?  
Don't be afraid.  
  
Come on up the ladder to the roof  
Where we can see heaven much better.  
Let's go up the ladder to the roof  
Where we can be closer to heaven.  
  
We'll laugh, I'll tell you the story of love.  
How it is, the happiness in it, baby.  
We combine these thoughts and together we will travel  
To the fountain of lovingness.  
I will never, never, never, never,  
Never leave you, baby.  
As we grow older and older and older, babe.  
  
Standing strong we'll say:  
Say, don't you wanna go?  
Say, don't you wanna go?  
Say, don't you wanna go?  
Say, don't you wanna go?  
Say, don't you wanna go?  
Say, don't you wanna go?  
Say, don't you wanna go?  
Say, don't you wanna go  
  
Up the ladder to the roof  
Where we can see heaven much better.  
Let's go up the ladder to the roof  
Where we can be closer to heaven.  
  
Let's go up the, up the, up the ladder to heaven.  
Heaven, heaven, heaven, heaven.

My grandpa died from asbestos.  
My daddy's name was Estes.  
And I don't know if that messed us up,  
Or what it did.  
  
My brother was-a workin' as an boiler.  
He was glad he wasn't workin' as an oiler.  
One day my sister went and lit up a match  
And up is where they went.  
  
They went up! Up! Up!  
Like a guy on a rocket.  
Up! Up! Up!  
Keep your luck, don't hock it.  
Up! Up! Up!  
Put your finger in a socket.  
Don't you know that's up, Jack?  
  
Aaah, now that leaves me with my cousins.  
You know I got 'em by the dozens.  
Well, they brought home a bomb and they didn't act calm,  
'cause up is where they went.  
  
Ah, but now everything is satisfactory.  
I'm on the swing shift at the big factory.  
Oooh, I keep cuttin', I just keep struttin'  
'cause up is where I'm goin'.  
  
I'm goin' up! Up! Up!  
Push the elevator button.  
Up! Up! Up!  
Like superman's cousin.  
Up! Up! Up!  
Ooh, fella, now I'm buzzin'.  
Don't you know that's up, Chuck?  
All right, Chuck.  
  
While gossiping over the back fence,  
My aunt was talking in her accents.  
The fickle finger of fate paced a well placed goose,  
And up is where she went.  
  
While visiting a funeral parlor,  
Uncle Louie, he let out a holler.  
A stiff went and winked at him  
And guess where he went?  
  
He went up! Up!  
Make the north pole my landin'.  
Up! Up!  
Talk frivolous abandon.  
Up! Up!  
Boom! From sitting to standing.  
Don't you know that's up?  
  
Goin' up and up and up  
And up and up and up and up!  
Doodlie-do-da do!

When he held me in his arms,  
When he held me in his arms and said,  
Baby, baby, baby, you are the only one for me.  
  
When a man loves a woman,  
Can't keep his mind on nothing else.  
He'll trade the world  
For the good thing he found.  
Yeah, if she's bad, he can't see it.  
She can do no wrong.  
Turn his back on his best friend  
If he put her down.  
  
When a man loves a woman,  
Spend his very last dime  
Tryin' to hold on to what he needs.  
He'll give up all his comforts,  
Go out and sleep out in the rain,  
If she says, baby, that is how it's gonna be.  
  
When a man loves a woman,  
Gives her everything that he has,  
Tryin' to hold on to her precious love,  
Cryin, baby, baby please don't treat me bad.  
  
When a man loves a woman  
Down deep in his soul,  
She can bring him such misery.  
Yeah, she's bad, but, oooh,  
He's the last one to know.  
Lovin' eyes don't ever see.  
  
So, this man says he loves me, he loves me.  
He gives me everything, everything,  
Everything that he has,  
Tryin' to hold on to my precious love,  
Cryin', baby, baby, baby, don't you, don't you  
Treat me, treat me bad.  
Ohhhh, yeah.  
  
When a man loves a woman  
He can do her no wrong.  
He could never hold another girl.  
Oh, you tell me you love me, baby,  
And gonna hold me tight.  
Baby, baby, this is a man's world.  
No, no.  
Oh, baby, a change is gonna come down  
In this man's world.

Always remember my friend  
The world will change again  
And you may have to come back  
Through everywhere you've been  
  
When your life was low  
You had nowhere to go  
People turned their backs on you  
And everybody said that you were through  
  
I took you in, made you strong again  
Put you back together  
Out of all the dreams you left along the way  
You left me shining  
  
Now you're doing well  
From stories I hear tell  
You own the world again  
Everyone's your friend  
  
Although I never hear from you  
Still it's nice to know  
You used to love me so  
When your life was low  
  
I took you in. I made you strong again  
I put you back together  
Out of all the dreams you left along the way  
You left me shining  
  
Now you're doing well  
From stories I hear tell  
You own the world again  
Everyone's your friend  
  
Although I never hear from you  
Still it's nice to know  
You used to love me so  
You used to love me so  
When your life was low  
  
But always remember my friend  
The world will change again  
And you may have to come back  
Through everywhere you've been  
The world will change again

Every time I touch you  
My heart skips a beat.  
Every time I kiss you  
I feel love from my head to my feet.  
Somethin' deep within me, baby,  
Sayin' you should be mine.  
Don't you know, baby, somewhere  
I got to, I got to draw the line?  
  
Tell me, baby, whose side are you on?  
Are you wih me, or am I all alone?  
Whoa, baby,  
Oh, where you been so long?  
Since I need you,  
Oh, won't you please come home?  
  
And every mornin' I wake up,  
Can't hide my tears.  
After all the lovin', baby,  
We've had through the years.  
It's a lonely season, baby,  
For you to leave, leave with no reason, babe.  
I just can't help believin'  
This time you're really, really, really leavin'.  
  
Whoa, baby, whose side are you on?  
Are you with me, or am I all alone?  
Whoa, baby,  
Oh, where you been, where ya,  
Where have you been so long?  
Since I need you, woo, come on home!  
  
Whoa, baby, whose side are you on?  
Since I need you, oh!  
Whoa, baby,  
Where you been, where you been,  
Where you been so damn long?  
Since I need you,  
Whoa, honey, honey, come home!

Ohhhh, oh, oh, oh, ohhh.  
It must have been cold there in my shadow,  
To never have sunlight on your face.  
You were content to let me shine, that's your way.  
You always walked a step behind.  
  
So I was the one with all the glory,  
While you were the one with all the strength.  
A beautiful face without a name for so long.  
A beautiful smile to hide the pain.  
  
Did you ever know that you're my hero,  
And everything I would like to be?  
I can fly higher than an eagle,  
For you are the wind beneath my wings.  
  
It might have appeared to go unnoticed,  
But I've got it all here in my heart.  
I want you to know I know the truth, of course I know it.  
I would be nothing without you.  
  
Did you ever know that you're my hero?  
You're everything I wish I could be.  
I could fly higher than an eagle,  
For you are the wind beneath my wings.  
  
Did I ever tell you you're my hero?  
You're everything, everything I wish I could be.  
Oh, and I, I could fly higher than an eagle,  
For you are the wind beneath my wings,  
'cause you are the wind beneath my wings.  
  
Oh, the wind beneath my wings.  
You, you, you, you are the wind beneath my wings.  
Fly, fly, fly away. You let me fly so high.  
Oh, you, you, you, the wind beneath my wings.  
Oh, you, you, you, the wind beneath my wings.  
  
Fly, fly, fly high against the sky,  
So high I almost touch the sky.  
Thank you, thank you,  
Thank God for you, the wind beneath my wings.
