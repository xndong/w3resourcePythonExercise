What if I told you it was all meant to be?  
Would you believe me? Would you agree?  
It's almost that feeling we've met before  
So tell me that you don't think I'm crazy  
When I tell you love has come here and now  
A moment like this  
  
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this  
Some people search forever for that one special kiss  
Oh, I can't believe its happening to me  
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this  
Everything changes, but beauty remains  
Something so tender I can't explain  
  
Well, I may be dreaming, but still lie awake  
Can't we make this dream last forever?  
And I'll cherish all the love we share  
A moment like this  
  
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this  
Some people search forever for that one special kiss  
Oh, I can't believe it's happening to me

Could this be the greatest love of all?  
I want to know that you will catch me when I fall  
So let me tell you this

I can show you the world,  
Shining, shimmering, splendid,  
Tell me, princess, now when did  
You last let your heart decide?  
  
I can open your eyes,  
Take you wonder by wonder,  
Over, sideways and under,  
On a magic carpet ride  
  
A whole new world,  
A new fantastic point of view,  
No one to tell us no,  
Or where to go,  
Or say we're only dreaming  
  
A whole new world,  
A dazzling place I never knew,  
But when I'm way up here,  
It's crystal clear,  
That now I'm in a whole new world with you  
  
Now I'm in a whole new world with you  
  
Unbelievable sights,  
Indescribable feeling,  
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling,  
Through an endless diamond sky  
  
A whole new world

It's like you're a drug  
It's like you're a demon I can't face down  
It's like I'm stuck  
It's like I'm running from you all the time  
And I know I let you have all the power  
It's like the only company I seek is misery all around  
It's like you're a leech  
Sucking the life from me  
It's like I can't breathe  
Without you inside of me  
And I know I let you have all the power  
And I realize I'm never gonna quit you over time  
  
It's like I can't breathe  
It's like I can't see anything  
Nothing but you  
I'm addicted to you  
It's like I can't think  
Without you interrupting me  
In my thoughts  
In my dreams  
You've taken over me  
It's like I'm not me  
It's like I'm not me  
  
It's like I'm lost  
It's like I'm giving up slowly  
It's like you're a ghost that's haunting me  
Leave me alone  
And I know these voices in my head  
Are mine alone  
And I know I'll never change my ways  
If I don't give you up now  
  
It's like I can't breathe  
It's like I can't see anything  
Nothing but you  
I'm addicted to you  
It's like I can't think  
Without you interrupting me  
In my thoughts  
In my dreams  
You've taken over me  
It's like I'm not me  
It's like I'm not me  
  
I'm hooked on you, I need a fix, I can't take it  
Just one more hit, I promise I can deal with it  
I'll handle it, quit it, just one more time, then that's it  
Just a little bit more to get me through this  
  
I'm hooked on you, I need a fix, I can't take it  
Just one more hit, I promise I can deal with it  
I'll handle it, quit it, just one more time, then that's it  
Just a little bit more to get me through this  
  
It's like I can't breathe  
It's like I can't see anything

Without you interrupting me  
In my thoughts  
In my dreams  
You've taken over me  
It's like I'm not me  
It's like I'm not me

Will:  
Listen, baby,  
Ain't no mountain high,  
Ain't no valley low,  
Ain't no river wide enough, baby  
  
Kelly:  
If you need me, call me,  
No matter where you are,  
No matter how far  
  
Will:  
Don't worry, baby  
  
Kelly:  
I'll be there in a hurry,  
You don't have to worry  
  
Both:  
'Cause, baby, there  
Ain't no mountain high enough,  
Ain't no valley low enough,  
Ain't no river wide enough,  
To keep me from getting to you, babe  
  
Will:  
Remember the day when I set you free,  
I told you could always, always count on me  
  
Kelly:  
From that day on, I made a vow,  
I'll be there when you want me, someday, somehow  
  
Both:  
'Cause, baby, there  
Ain't no mountain high enough,  
Ain't no valley low enough,  
Ain't no river wide enough,  
To keep me from getting from you, babe  
  
Will:  
Oooo, darling  
  
Kelly:  
  
No wind, no rain,  
No winters cold,  
Can stop me now  
  
Will:  
Don't stop me, baby  
  
Kelly:  
'Cause you are my goal,  
Oooo, baby  
  
Will (while Kelly is singing):  
When you are in trouble,  
I'll be there on the double,  
Just send for me  
  
(Lots of chorus and random words)  
  
Both:  
'Cause, baby, there  
Ain't no mountain high enough,  
Ain't no valley low enough,  
Ain't no river wide enough,  
To keep me from getting to you, babe  
  
Ain't no mountain high enough!

Tear up the photographs  
But yesterday won't let go  
Every day every day every minute  
Here comes the emptiness  
Just can't leave lonely alone  
Every day every day hey hey  
This second-chancin's really getting me down  
You give and takin' everything I dreamed about  
It's time you let me know let me know just let go  
  
[Chorus]  
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted  
Was a simple way to get over you  
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted  
Was an in-between to escape this desperate scene  
Where every lie reveals the truth  
Baby cause all I ever wanted  
All I ever wanted was you  
  
I'd rather walk alone  
Don't wanna chase you around  
Every day every day every minute I'd fall a thousand times  
For I let you drag me down  
Every day every day hey hey  
Your new beginning was a perfect ending  
But I keep feeling we've already been here before  
It's time you let me know let me know just let go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Tell me with so many out there  
Why I always turn to you  
Your goodbyes tear me down every time  
And it's so easy to see that the blame is on me  
  
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted  
Was a simple way to get over you  
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted  
Was an in-between to escape this desperate scene  
  
[Chorus]

For all I know, you could be near  
And every breath I take, you could feel  
For all I know, you're just a thought that crossed my mind  
What I wouldn't give to live that thought of mine.  
  
For all I know is nothing's changed  
Nothing ever will if I don't leave this place  
For all I know, you're waiting for me to whisper your name  
What I wouldn't give to kiss your sweet face  
  
Cause all I know is I need you here  
And all I have, I would give away so I could say this dear  
All I feel, oh I tried so hard to not feel  
It's killing me  
  
For all I know, you forgot me  
For all I know, you're different, completely  
And everything we had was never what I thought it was  
But for all I know, oh it was love.  
  
'cause all I know is I need you here  
All I have, I would give away to so I could say this dear  
All I feel, oh I tried so hard to not feel  
It's killing me  
  
Now everyone has a name  
And every face always somehow looks the same  
I always feel so alone, especially when it rains  
For all I know, boy, you do the same, yeah  
  
Yeah I didn't know that I need you here  
All I had, I gave away cause I was still afraid to feel  
All I feel, oh I tried so hard to not feel  
It's killing me, it's killing me  
  
All I know  
All I know  
For all I know

When we're driving in your car  
It's like I'm on my own, yeah  
I can't ask you how you are  
You're always on the phone, yeah  
And when we kiss I feel so empty  
I really wish you knew what's been on my mind  
You're gonna miss me, so get ready  
I'm about to tell you why  
  
'Cause when I'm with you I'm alone  
No matter what you say  
I hope you know, whoa  
That I'm alone  
You say you're gonna change  
But I know you won't, whoa oh  
  
When you look me in the eye  
It's like you're far away, yeah  
Some pretty legs go walking by  
Your gaze is wandering, yeah  
It's such a shame that you don't notice  
The way that everybody's looking at me  
Get off the train  
This love is hopeless  
Feeling like I'm gonna sink  
  
'Cause when I'm with you I'm alone  
No matter what you say  
I hope you know, whoa  
That I'm alone  
You say you're gonna change  
But I know you won't, whoa oh  
  
But here's something you don't know about me  
When you pushed me out  
I found something better, you'll see  
While you were paying no attention to me  
I found somebody who can treat me right  
  
When I'm with him I'm not alone  
Gets better everyday  
I hope you know, oh  
I'm not alone  
And it's never gonna change  
I hope you know  
When I'm with you I'm alone  
No matter what you say  
I hope you know, whoa  
That I'm alone  
You say you're gonna change  
But I know you won't, whoa oh  
  
I'm not alone (I'm not alone, I'm not alone, I'm not alone, I'm not alone, I'm
not alone, I'm not alone)  
I'm not alone (I'm not alone, I'm not alone, I'm not alone, I'm not alone, I'm
not alone, I'm not alone)

Hear me,  
Don't tempt me anymore,  
It was all a dream,  
Resist your feelings stranger,  
  
Don't call me, don't write,  
Don't lose any sleep over me,  
Cause I'm sleeping just fine,  
Yeah,  
  
I don't cry,  
And I don't want you to anymore,  
I'm ok,  
You are better as long as you're far,  
I don't want you hanging around my door,  
Anymore, anymore, anymore,  
  
Hear this, Take the hint and all the signs,  
Hear me, I don't want to talk anytime,  
I don't know or need you anymore,  
And I like it,  
Yeah,  
  
I don't cry,  
And I don? T want you to anymore,  
I'm ok,  
You are better as long as you're far,  
I don't want you hanging around my door,  
Anymore, anymore, anymore,  
  
For once, just let me be,  
For once, you can think of me,  
For once, I'm happy,  
So don't do it, don't ruin it,  
Don't say it cause I don't want to hear it anymore,  
I know you feel it,  
Don't call me, don't write,  
Don't lose any sleep over me,  
Cause I'm sleeping just fine,  
Yeah,  
  
I don't cry,  
And I don't want you to anymore,  
I'm ok,  
You are better as long as you're far,  
I don't want you hanging around my door,  
Anymore, anymore, anymore

Anytime you feel  
Like you just can't hold on  
Just hold on to my love  
I'll help you be strong  
  
But you're so afraid to lose  
And baby I can't reach your heart  
I can't face this world it's keeping us apart  
And I could be the one to show you  
Everything you missed before  
Just hold on now  
'Cause I could be the one to give you more  
  
[Chorus]  
Anytime you need a love baby I'm on your side  
Just let me be the one that can make it all right  
Anytime you need a love baby you're in my heart  
I could make it all right  
  
I look into your eyes  
And I feel it coming through  
I can't help but want you more than I want to  
So baby take our love your way  
Cast them all on me  
That's all I ever wanted was just to make you see  
  
But I could be the one to heal you  
All that you've been searching for  
Just hold on to my love  
And baby let me give you more  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now there's no way out  
And I can't help the way I feel  
'Cause baby I'm on fire  
And I'll be waiting right here  
You know our love isn't real  
  
[Chorus]

Repeat chorus till fade.

My love's a weapon and I'm knockin' 'em dead  
I got a heart that's tough as leather  
Get what I want and just forget 'em  
This game you're playin' is a Russian Roulette  
Just cause I'm sweet when we're together  
Doesn't mean I'm yours forever  
I never should have looked into your eyes  
Now everybody's gonna see how I feel  
  
Don't go ruinin', ruinin' my, my bad reputation  
Don't go tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em all the plans we've been makin'  
Cause everyone knows that I don't cry  
You never see stars shinin' in my eyes  
Ruinin', ruinin' my, my bad reputation  
  
Well I tell 'em, tell 'em, yeah you're nothin' to me  
I tell 'em that you, you're just another  
You're just like any other  
Well I try to sell 'em but they ain't buyin' it  
Baby they see me start to stutter  
When they ask if you're my lover  
I'm losing sleep, what's gotten into me?  
I'm usually never this way, baby  
  
Don't go ruinin', ruinin' my, my bad reputation  
Don't go tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em all the plans we've been makin'  
Cause everyone knows that I don't cry  
You never see stars shinin' in my eyes  
Ruinin', ruinin' my, my bad reputation  
  
I have got to pull myself together, but I can't control it  
My lips, they know what they want, everybody knows it  
Once a girl, controlled the world with words that pierced the bone  
Now I'm smiling like a lovesick pup and everybody knows it  
  
Don't go ruinin', ruinin' my, my bad reputation  
Don't go tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em all the plans we've been makin'  
Cause everyone knows that I don't cry  
You never see stars shinin' in my eyes  
Ruinin', ruinin' my, my bad reputation

Far, away from it all  
You and me with no one else around  
A brand new start  
Is all we need, it's all we need to mend these hearts  
Back to the beginning  
  
Be still  
Let it go  
  
Before we lost hope  
When we still touched and love wasn't so hard  
  
Be still  
I already know  
  
Foolish one with the smile  
You don't have to be brave  
Every time we fall down  
But we're falling from grace  
I'll gladly climb your walls if you'll meet me halfway  
  
Slow, slow it down  
Why do we run, we're missing so much babe  
Just lay in my arms for a while  
  
Be still  
We should've known  
  
Foolish one with the smile  
You don't have to be brave  
I'll gladly climb your walls  
If you'll meet me halfway  
Every time we fall down  
But we're falling from grace  
Here's my hand and my heart  
It's yours to take  
  
Be still  
Be still now  
Be still  
Be still  
Be still

I will not make  
The same mistakes that you did  
I will not let myself  
Cause my heart so much misery  
I will not break  
The way you did, you fell so hard  
I've learned the hard way  
To never let it get that far  
  
Because of you  
I never stray too far from the sidewalk  
Because of you  
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt  
Because of you  
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me  
Because of you  
I am afraid  
  
I lose my way  
And it's not too long before you point it out  
I cannot cry  
Because I know that's weakness in your eyes  
I'm forced to fake  
A smile, a laugh everyday of my life  
My heart can't possibly break  
When it wasn't even whole to start with  
  
Because of you  
I never stray too far from the sidewalk  
Because of you  
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt  
Because of you  
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me  
Because of you  
I am afraid  
  
I watched you die  
I heard you cry every night in your sleep  
I was so young  
You should have known  
Better than to lean on me  
You never thought of anyone else  
You just saw your pain  
And now I cry in the middle of the night  
For the same damn thing  
  
Because of you  
I never stray too far from the sidewalk  
Because of you  
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt  
Because of you  
I try my hardest just to forget everything  
Because of you  
I don't know how to let anyone else in  
Because of you  
I'm ashamed of my life  
Because it's empty  
Because of you  
I am afraid  
  
Because of you  
Because of you

I wonder how I ever made it through a day  
How did I settle for a world in shades of gray  
When you go in circles all the scenery looks the same  
And you don't know how, then I looked into your eyes  
And the world stretched out in front of me and I realized  
  
[Chorus]  
I never lived before your love  
I never felt before your touch  
I never needed anyone to make me feel alive  
But then again, I wasn't really living  
I never lived, before your love  
  
I wanted more than just an ordinary life  
All of my dreams seemed like castles in the sky  
I stand before you and my heart is in your hands  
And I don't know how I survived without you kiss  
'Cause you've given me a reason to exist  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And I don't know why  
Why the sun decides to shine  
But you breathed you love into me, just in time  
  
[Chorus]

Seems like just yesterday  
You were a part of me  
I used to stand so tall  
I used to be so strong  
Your arms around me tight  
Everything, it felt so right  
Unbreakable like nothing could go wrong  
  
Now I can't breathe  
No, I can't sleep  
I'm barely hanging on  
  
[Chorus]  
Here I am  
Once again  
I'm torn into pieces  
Can't deny it  
Can't pretend  
Just thought you were the one  
Broken up deep inside  
But you won't get to see the tears I cry  
Behind these hazel eyes  
  
I told you everything  
Opened up and let you in  
You made me feel alright for once in my life  
Now all that's left of me  
Is what I pretend to be  
So together but so broken up inside  
  
'Cause I can't breathe  
No, I can't sleep  
I'm barely hanging on  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Swallow me then spit me out  
For hating you, I blame myself  
Just seeing you, it kills me now  
Now I don't cry  
On the outside, anymore!  
  
[Chorus: x2]

Hello mister, how you're doing?  
I didn't catch your name!  
No I'm not from here,  
I've just moved in, it's only been a few days.  
No, I don't mind, that could be fine,  
We could hang out some time, oh!  
But I gotta run now, hope to see you soon!  
Oh, oh!  
  
Bridge:  
Wake up in the morning, get that paper  
Walking on the hallway heading forward,  
And we pass by, and this is how  
He doesn't know what he does to my heart!  
Gotta catch him by the afternoon,  
If I miss him I don't know what I do,  
Yeah it might sound crazy, but it could be my baby!  
  
Chorus:  
I think I'm in love with the boy next door,  
Don't ask if he feels that same way sure  
I can tell by the way he turns to look at me,  
I believe I fall in for the boy next door!  
Yeah!  
The boy next door, oh yeah!  
  
I check the man everyday  
But about the same time I know he's there!  
So I can catch a quick glimpse of his smile!  
Make it seem as a coincidence,  
I know I can see right through my eyes that I'm falling for him  
And that's no lie, no, no!  
  
Bridge:  
Wake up in the morning, get that paper  
Walking on the hallway heading forward,  
And we pass by, and this is how  
He doesn't know what he does to my heart!  
Gotta catch him by the afternoon,  
If I miss him I don't know what I do,  
Yeah it might sound crazy, but it could be my baby!  
  
Chorus:  
I think I'm in love with the boy next door,  
Don't ask if he feels that same way sure  
I can tell by the way he turns to look at me  
I believe I fall in for the boy next door!  
Yeah!  
The boy next door, oh yeah!  
  
I get butterflies when he's around,  
And I can't help to wonder if he knows!  
But when I feel my... Sweaty,  
... Says let's go I'm ready,  
Can't remember having a crush like this before!  
  
Chorus: (x2)  
I think I'm in love with the boy next door,  
Don't ask if he feels that same way sure  
I can tell by the way he turns to look at me  
I believe I fall in for the boy next door!  
Yeah!  
The boy next door, oh yeah

What gets me through this  
What makes it worth it is the hope for a better day  
What you don't notice  
What you lost focus on is I'm not the type to break  
  
Eight years of eggshell calloused feet  
Nine lives spent working on this dream  
Six feet under but breathin'  
One drink to celebrate my pain  
Three drinks and I'm brand new again  
One voice is all it takes and I won't stop  
  
I take the hit, I feel the sting of another loss  
But while I gleam I keep on trying 'cause it's just a matter of time  
I see the light, even if it's mine I won't back down  
I'm gonna show you 'til you see me, 'til you recognize this fire  
  
What I am chasing  
What I have faith in is that chance to test my wings  
What you don't know is  
What you lost focus on is I'm not goin' away  
  
Eight years of sittin' on the bench  
Nine lives spent tangled in your web  
Six feet under but breathin'  
One drink to celebrate my pain  
Three drinks and I'm brand new again  
One voice is all it takes and I won't stop  
  
I take the hit, I feel the sting of another loss  
But while I gleam I keep on trying 'cause it's just a matter of time  
I see the light, even if it's mine I won't back down  
I'm gonna show you 'til you see me, 'til you recognize this fire  
  
So you keep on pushing and I keep on fighting  
You try and break me as I break the silence  
  
Picking myself off the ground, it stings  
Trading comfort, souls for dreams  
Is it what we're made to be?  
Trying so hard to make you see  
I don't need your hand, I got my own  
There is no fear because it's gone  
I'm not gonna cry no more  
I'm gonna stand up like I've always done  
  
Eight years of eggshell calloused feet  
Nine lives spent working on this dream  
Six feet under but breathin'  
I take the hit, I feel the sting of another loss  
But while I gleam I keep on trying 'cause it's just a matter of time  
I see the light, even if it's mine I won't back down  
I'm gonna show you 'til you see me, 'til you recognize this fire  
  
So you keep on pushing and I keep on fighting  
You try and break me as I break the silence  
You keep on pushing and I keep on fighting  
You try and break me as I break the silence

Grew up in a small town  
And when the rain would fall down  
I'd just stare out my window  
Dreamin' of what could be  
And if I'd end up happy  
I would pray  
  
Trying hard to reach out  
But when I tried to speak out  
Felt like no one could hear me  
Wanted to belong here  
But something felt so wrong here  
So I pray  
I could breakaway  
  
I'll spread my wings, and I'll learn how to fly  
I'll do what it takes till I touch the sky  
And I'll make a wish  
Take a chance  
Make a change  
And breakaway  
Out of the darkness and into the sun  
But I won't forget all the ones that I love  
I'll take a risk  
Take a chance  
Make a change  
And breakaway  
  
Want to feel the warm breeze  
Sleep under a palm tree  
Feel the rush of the ocean  
Get on board a fast train  
Travel on a jet plane  
Faraway  
And breakaway  
  
I'll spread my wings, and I'll learn how to fly  
I'll do what it takes till I touch the sky  
And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change  
And breakaway  
Out of the darkness and into the sun  
I won't forget all the ones that I love  
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change  
And breakaway  
  
Buildings with a hundred floors  
Swinging 'round revolvin' doors  
Maybe I don't know where they take me  
But gotta keep movin' on  
Movin' on  
Fly away  
Breakaway  
  
I'll spread my wings, and I'll learn how to fly  
Though it's not easy to tell you goodbye  
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change  
And breakaway  
Out of the darkness and into the sun  
But I won't forget the place I come from  
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change  
And breakaway  
Breakaway  
Breakaway

Shaking your head like it's all wrong  
Before you're here you're already gone  
And even with the light all around you  
You're all alone in the dark.  
  
You're breaking your own heart  
Taking it too far down a lonely road  
You say it's just one love  
But when it's close enough you just let it go  
The very thing you've been the most afraid of  
You've been doing it from the start, breaking your own heart.  
  
Too many tears, too many falls  
It's easier here behind these walls  
But you don't have to walk in the shadows  
When life is so hard.  
  
You're breaking your own heart  
Taking it too far down a lonely road  
You say it's just one love  
But when it's close enough you just let it go  
The very thing you've been the most afraid of  
You've been doing it from the start, breaking your own heart.  
  
You're breaking your own heart.  
It's not too late, I'm still right here.  
If only you let go of your fears.  
  
You're breaking your heart  
Taking your own heart down a lonely road  
You say it's just one love  
But when it's close enough you just let it go  
The very thing you've been the most afraid of  
You've been doing it from the start, breaking your own heart.  
You're breaking your own heart.

I don't wanna be left behind  
Distance was a friend of mine  
Catching breath in a web of lies  
I've spent most of my life  
Riding waves, playing acrobat  
Shadowboxing the other half  
Learning how to react  
I've spent most of my time  
  
Catching my breath, letting it go  
Turning my cheek for the sake of this show  
Now that you know, this is my life  
I won't be told what's supposed to be right  
  
Catch my breath, no one can hold me back, I ain't got time for that  
Catch my breath, won't let them get me down, it's all so so simple now  
  
Addicted to the love I found  
Heavy heart, now a weightless cloud  
Making time for the ones that count  
I'll spend the rest of my time  
Laughing hard with the windows down  
Leaving footprints all over town  
Keeping faith, Karma comes around  
I will spent the rest of my life  
  
Catching my breath, letting it go  
Turning my cheek for the sake of this show  
Now that you know, this is my life  
I won't be told what's supposed to be right  
  
Catch my breath, no one can hold me back, I ain't got time for that  
Catch my breath, won't let them get me down, it's all so so simple now  
  
You helped me see  
The beauty in everything  
  
Catching my breath, letting it go  
Turning my cheek for the sake of this show  
Now that you know, this is my life  
I won't be told what's supposed to be right  
  
Catching my breath, letting it go  
Turning my cheek for the sake of this show  
Now that you know, this is my life  
I won't be told what's supposed to be right  
Catch my breath  
  
Catch my breath, no one can hold me back, I ain't got time for that  
Catch my breath, won't let them get me down, it's all so so simple now  
It's all so simple now  
  
Catching my breath, letting it go  
Turning my cheek for the sake of this show  
Now that you know, this is my life  
I won't be told what's supposed to be right  
Catch my breath  
  
Catch my breath, no one can hold me back, I ain't got time for that  
Catch my breath, won't let them get me down, it's all so so simple now

You're not worth it babe,  
The trouble you bring the noise you keep  
And you don't even care, yeah.  
  
I'm so sick of you babe,  
Nights wasted I'm through faking.  
You don't turn me on,  
You don't do anything at all.  
  
Baby I can't stand the sight of your face.  
Baby I don't even want to hear your name.  
  
Don't know what I saw  
But I ain't seeing it now.  
Woke up this morning, bitterness in my mouth.  
  
Guess I fell too fast,  
Guess I learned my lesson.  
So much for true love,  
I'll take this chivas instead, oh yeah.  
  
You're too high maintenance babe,  
All the time you spent trying to fit in and no one even cares, yeah.  
It's so rediculous babe,  
Watching you turn as I burn.  
It's like you're not even there, yeah.  
  
Baby don't you try and hold my hand.  
Maybe you should keep your eyes on your new girlfriend.  
  
Don't know what I saw  
But are you seeing it now.  
Woke up this morning, biterness in my mouth.  
Guess I fell too fast,  
Guess I learned my lesson.  
So much for true love  
I'll take this chivas instead, oh.  
  
I'll take this chivas instead  
Of your bed.  
It wasn't even good.  
Trust me.

You are crap, yeah.  
You should keep your eyes on your new little brat. Yeah.  
It's hard not to look I know  
I'm amazing  
I love you... Chivas.

Dark hair, such a sexy smile..  
Sweet lips ooh how I wish they were mine..  
Falling and I can't catch my breath,  
Don't leave me hanging here by myself...  
  
Ohhhhhhhh noooo.. Ohhhhhh..  
  
Tension.. oooh it's rising...  
I see you looking at me and I think I like it..

But I don't care.. Take me, Take Me,take me there...

Boy, come here, come here, yeeaaaahh

If anyone asks, I'll tell them we both just moved on  
When people all stare I'll pretend that I don't hear them talk  
Whenever I'll see you I'll swallow my pride and bite my tongue  
Pretend I'm okay with it all  
Act like there's nothing wrong  
  
[Chorus]  
Is it over yet?  
Can I open my eyes?  
Is this as hard as it gets?  
Is this what it feels like to really cry?  
Cry  
  
If anyone asks, I'll tell them we just grew apart  
What do I care if they believe me or not?  
Whenever I feel your memory is breaking my heart  
I'll pretend I'm okay with it all  
Act like there's nothing wrong  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm talking in circles  
I'm lying, they know it  
Why won't this just all go away?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Cry

There's a place that I know  
It's not pretty there and few have ever gone  
If I show it to you now  
Will it make you run away  
  
Or will you stay  
Even if it hurts  
Even if I try to push you out  
Will you return?  
And remind me who I really am  
Please remind me who I really am  
  
Everybody's got a dark side  
Do you love me?  
Can you love mine?  
Nobody's a picture perfect  
But we're worth it  
You know that we're worth it  
Will you love me?  
Even with my dark side?  
  
Like a diamond  
From black dust  
It's hard to know  
It can become  
If you give up  
So don't give up on me  
Please remind me who I really am  
  
Everybody's got a dark side  
Do you love me?  
Can you love mine?  
Nobody's a picture perfect  
But we're worth it  
You know that we're worth it  
Will you love me?  
Even with my dark side?  
  
Don't run away  
Don't run away  
Just tell me that you will stay  
Promise me you will stay  
Don't run away  
Don't run away  
Just promise me you will stay  
Promise me you will stay  
  
Will you love me? Ohh  
Everybody's got a dark side  
Do you love me?  
Can you love mine?  
Nobody's a picture perfect  
But we're worth it  
You know that we're worth it  
Will you love me?  
Even with my dark side?

You left me standing there  
You didn't even care  
You just walked away  
I felt so scared  
You never even looked back at me  
So unaware of how cruel you could be  
I was always there  
Did you ever care?  
  
Did you ever care for me?  
Did you ever believe in me?  
Did you ever love me?  
Did you? Did you? Did you?  
  
You didn't have to fall  
I didn't need your tears  
I didn't want your pity  
Just any feeling at all would have been sufficient  
I never felt so small, so insignificant  
You left me naked with nothing at all  
How could I be so blind?  
  
Did you ever care for me?  
Did you ever believe in me?  
Did you ever love me?  
Did you? Did you? Did you?  
  
Falling down  
Darkness surrounds me  
I open my eyes  
I bow my head and cry  
  
Did you ever believe in me?  
Did you ever even love me?  
  
Did you ever care for me?  
Did you ever believe in me?  
Did you ever love me?  
Did you? Did you? Did you?  
  
Did you ever care for me?  
Did you ever love me?

I've known about you for a while now  
When he leaves me he wears a smile  
Now as soon as he's away from me  
In your arms is where he wants to be  
  
Kelly:  
But you're the one he rushes home to  
Youre the one he gave his name to  
I've never seen his face in the early morning light  
You have his mornings his daytimes  
And sometimes I have his nights  
  
Both:  
But does he love you (does he love you)  
Like he loves me (like he loves me)  
Does he think of you (does he think of you)  
When he's holding me  
Does he whisper all of his fantasies  
Does he love you (does he love you)  
Like he's been loving me  
  
Kelly:  
But when he's with me  
He says he needs me  
And that he wants me  
That he believes in me  
  
Reba:  
And when I'm in his arms  
How he swears there's no one else  
Is he deceiving me  
Or am I deceiving myself  
  
Both:  
Does he love you (does he love you)  
Like he loves me(like he loves me)  
Does he think of you (does he think of you)  
When he's holding me  
And does he whisper all of his fantasies  
Does he love you (does he love you)  
Like he's been loving me  
  
Oooh shouldn't I loose my temper  
Oooh shouldn't I be ashamed  
'cause I have everything to loose  
I have nothing to gain  
  
Does he love you (does he love you)  
Like he loves me (like he loves me)  
Does he think of you (does he think of you)  
Whens he's holding me  
Does he whisper you all of his fantasies  
Does he love you (does he love you)  
Like he's been loving me  
  
Ooooh  
Does he love you?

You look at me,  
Like you always do.  
You don't have a clue.  
You smile at me,  
You hug me,  
But you don't know I want you.  
You play with me,  
You flirt with me,  
You tell me all your secrets.  
I'm always the one you run to,  
But to you I'm just your friend.  
  
Don't say I love you,  
Don't say you need me,  
Don't say I trust you,  
My heart can't take it.  
Don't say you want me,  
Don't say you miss me,  
Don't hurt me.  
Don't say you love me.  
  
Ooooh ooooh no... No.. Nooo.  
  
I try my best to rid these thoughts,  
Of you and I it's so hard.  
When you come to me,  
I fall back on my knees.  
I learned to hate love.  
You kiss me on the cheek,  
You say you'd never make it without me.  
It's getting harder everyday.  
Please don't say to me,  
  
Don't say I love you,  
Don't say you need me,  
Don't say I trust you,  
My heart can't take it.  
Don't say you want me,  
Don't say you miss me,  
  
Don't hurt me.  
Don't say you love me.  
  
Don't say you love me.  
Don't say you love me.  
Don't say you love me.  
Don't say you love me.  
  
My heart can't take it.  
I love you so much.  
But you don't see me.  
I hate love.  
  
Don't say I love you,  
Don't say you need me,  
Don't say I trust you,  
Unless you mean it.  
Don't say you want me,  
Don't say you need me,  
Don't hurt me.  
No...  
  
Don't say I love you,  
Don't say you need me,  
Don't say I trust you,  
My heart can't take it.  
Don't say you want me,  
Don't say you miss me,  
Don't hurt me.  
Don't say you love me.

Any chance you get to play the warn out pity card  
Any opportunity to push my buttons hard  
It's getting old, your "poor me" thoughts  
Believe me, boy, when I say "so what"  
  
This broken record thing has got to stop  
I'm losing interest in your pillow talk  
  
And oh it's not looking good  
And oh I'm not in the mood  
And oh I can't get through  
To you  
  
Don't be a girl about it  
'Cause I didn't say yes  
Don't be a girl about it  
'Cause I wouldn't pretend  
Don't be a girl about it  
Now you're whining again  
Don't be a girl about it  
You're such a girl about it  
  
Now you're up in arms because I say we're not working out  
You wonder if I loved you from the start, well I tell you what  
I knew a guy who changed my world  
And then he grew into a little girl  
  
This metamorphosis is just too much  
You're crossing lines that I just can't let go on  
  
And oh it's not looking good  
And oh I'm not in the mood  
And oh I can't get through  
To you  
  
Don't be a girl about it  
'Cause I didn't say yes  
Don't be a girl about it  
'Cause I wouldn't pretend  
Don't be a girl about it  
And now you're whining again  
Don't be a girl about it  
You're such a girl about it  
  
And oh I'm sleeping with the enemy oh oh  
And oh I'm counting sheep while you're in love  
  
I guess it's true that love can grow in different directions  
I chose the high road and you chose to be a girl  
I know you're mad at me now  
It's all my fault somehow  
Here comes my favorite part  
You're so misunderstood  
  
And oh it's not looking good  
And oh I'm not in the mood  
And oh yeah I'm so through  
To you  
  
Don't be a girl about it  
'Cause I didn't say yes  
Don't be a girl about it  
'Cause I wouldn't pretend  
Don't be a girl about it  
And now you're whining again  
Don't be a girl about it  
You're such a girl about it  
  
And oh I'm sleeping with the enemy oh oh  
And oh I'm counting sheep while you're in love  
Don't be a girl about it

[Kelly]  
Why can't you see that I'm trying  
To repair. Our relationship cause of  
All this fighting, Why can't you stop all  
This cheating cause it's hurting both of us.  
  
[Kalan]  
Kelly I love you but sometimes  
I can't control what I do or say about  
You and I'm sorry that I sneaked around  
Behind your back but understand I was under perssure so.  
  
[Both]  
Don't leave me now or never. We could have  
Worked things out. Don't leave me cause of some  
Stupid things we said. So Don't leave me know or never.  
  
[Kelly]  
Ohh no Don't leave me  
Now or never we could have  
Worked things out. Don't leave me here wounded.  
  
[Kalan]  
I promise you this that we will  
Work this out as long as you Don't leave me.  
  
[Both]  
Don't leave me  
  
Now or never(oh never never) we could we could  
Have worked this out(yeah yeh) Don't leave me cause  
Of some stupid things we said. Don't leave me now or never.

[Kalan]  
Oh no I won't ever leave you now  
Or never I promise. Oh noooooo oooh  
  
[Kelly]  
Don't leave me now.

I used to be a little bit shy  
I kept my deepest feelings inside  
Speaking up to you about my emotions has always been hard  
But this just can't wait  
Tonight I feel a little bit brave  
So I won't let one more day pass without you explaining what we are  
  
This is gonna sound kind of silly  
But I couldn't help but notice  
The last time you kissed me  
You kept both eyes open  
Baby, can you tell me what does that mean?  
If you're looking all over your shoulder  
Then you don't need to be with me  
And I don't need to hold on  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't let me let me stop you  
From doing what you wanna do  
You don't wanna stick just me it's cool  
Take no chance getting over you  
No no don't let me let me stop you  
If you wanna leave baby you can leave  
Just don't pretend that you're into me  
If it ain't true no, don't let me stop you  
  
A lot of things I can take  
Got a high threshold for pain  
But let's get one thing straight, I'm not down to share you with anyone  
If that's not what you're looking for  
Nice knowing you, but there's the door  
'Cause I know that I can find someone who'll give me what I want  
  
This is gonna sound kind of silly  
If you're looking over your shoulder  
Then you don't need to be with me  
And I don't need to hold on  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Even if I'm in the brokenhearted  
I won't lie  
I don't wanna hear goodbye  
But either way I'll be alright  
  
[Chorus: x2]

Don't play that song for me  
'cause it brings back the memories  
Of the days that I once knew  
Of the days that I spent with you  
  
Oh no, don't let it play  
It fills my heart with pain  
Please stop it right away  
'cause I remember just what it said  
It said, "darling"  
  
You know that you lied  
Boy, you know that you lied  
You know that you lied  
You lied, you lied, you lied  
  
Remember on our first date  
You kissed me  
Then you walked away  
And I was only seventeen  
I never dreamed that he could be so mean  
  
Oh darling, don't you play no more  
Don't you dare play that song  
You know you lied  
  
Ohh

Let's wake up in the afternoon  
Pretend that we got nothing to do  
No we don't have to go by any agenda  
We can make up our own rules  
I see the way you're looking at me  
Baby know I'm feeling it too  
We can just light up every candle  
Move from room to room  
  
Stopping every minute just because you're in it  
Wishing everyday was Sunday, you're right next to me  
It's how it's supposed to be  
Hanging on every touch  
Baby don't rush, no no  
Baby don't rush  
  
Throw the map out of the window  
Taking the long way around  
To a secret place where no one could find us  
A little place we can call our own  
Come over here and take a picture  
Something we can hang on to  
We can look back and try to remember  
All the crazy things we gonna do  
  
Stopping every minute just because you're in it  
Wishing everyday was Sunday, you're right next to me  
It's how it's supposed to be  
Just hanging on every touch  
Baby don't rush  
Baby don't rush  
  
Stopping every minute just because you're in it  
Stopping every minute just because you're in it  
Stopping every minute  
  
Stopping every minute just because you're in it  
Wishing every day was Sunday, you're right next to me  
It's how it's supposed to be  
  
Stopping every minute just because you're in it  
Wishing everyday was Sunday, you're right next to me  
It's how it's supposed to be (supposed to be)  
Just hanging on every touch  
Baby don't rush no no  
Baby don't rush (Baby don't rush)  
Baby don't rush

It's over, it's over, it's over  
  
It seems you can't hear me  
When I open my mouth you never listen  
You say stay, but what does that mean  
Do you think that I honestly want to be reminded forever?  
  
[Chorus:]  
Don't waste your time trying to fix  
What I want to erase  
What I need to forget  
Don't waste your time on me my friend  
Friend, what does that even mean  
I don't want your hand  
You'll only pull me down  
So save your breath  
Don't waste your song on me, on me  
Don't waste your time  
  
It's not easy not answering  
Everytime I want to talk to you  
But I can't  
If you only knew the hell I put myself through  
Replaying memories in my head of you and I  
Every night  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You're calling  
You're talking  
You're trying  
Trying to get in  
But it's over, it's over  
It's over, friend  
  
Don't waste your time trying to fix it  
So save your breath  
Don't waste your song on me, on me  
Don't waste your time  
  
You held me  
You felt me  
You left me  
But it's over, it's over, it's over  
You touched me  
You had me  
But it's over, it's over  
It's over, my friend  
Don't waste my time

Simple math  
Our love divided by the square root of pride  
Multiply your lifeless time  
I'm going out of my mind  
It was heaven when I finally figured it out alone  
  
[Chorus]  
Didn't get it the first time  
But don't think I've been so blind  
And I may not be Einstein  
But I Know  
Dumb plus dumb equals you  
Dumb plus dumb equals you  
Dumb plus dumb equals you  
  
Even had the nerves to flirt with her in front of my face  
Here's your keys, your bags, your clothes and now get out of my place  
You say I'm crazy, and that we're happy  
Is that supposed to comfort me?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
All of your promises, flushed  
A thousand apologies, just  
Take out the pain and then it leaves us  
With nothing at all, no, nothing at all  
  
You can stop wasting my time  
Without you I'm just fine  
Why did it take me so long to figure out  
Dumb plus dumb equals you, equals you  
  
Didn't get it the first time  
Don't think I'd be so blind  
Yeah I may not be Einstein  
But I know  
  
Dumb plus dumb equals you, equals you  
  
Simple math  
Our love divided by the square root of pride  
Multiply your lifeless time  
I'm going out of my mind  
And I may not be Einstein  
  
But I know dumb plus dumb equals you, equals you

When did you know that nothing was right  
Were you just happy to hide  
Behind dreams and broken lies  
There's a crack in your perfect smile  
That's been growing a while  
Did you think you'd go out in style  
  
With all that you know  
How long did you know  
  
You took me for granted  
I don't understand it  
Went looking for answers  
I came up empty handed  
But don't worry about me  
Cause I'm stronger then you think  
And I know it's a blessing  
I came up empty handed  
  
Can you be whoever you like  
You just turn off the lights  
And find yourself a different disguise  
So you hide the scars you built over time  
Do you think I'm blind  
You're still lovely on the inside  
  
With all that you know  
How long did you know  
  
You took me for granted  
I don't understand it  
When looking for answers  
I came up empty handed  
Don't worry about me  
Cause I'm stronger than you think  
And I know it's a blessing  
I came up empty handed  
Empty handed  
  
When did you know that nothing was right  
Were you just happy to hide  
Behind dreams and broken lies  
With all that you know  
Why didn't you just go  
  
You took me for granted  
I don't understand it  
When looking for answers  
I came up empty handed  
But don't worry about me  
Cause I'm stronger then you think  
And I know it's a blessing  
I came up empty handed  
Empty handed  
Empty handed  
Empty handed

Every Christmas  
It's always the same  
I'm still here waiting  
Praying for you to finally come my way  
  
It's been so long  
Since I've seen your face  
If Santa cared for me at all then you wouldn't be  
So, so far away  
  
Santa isn't listening, no  
And I'm losing hope  
Oh God if it isn't too much  
Please bring my baby home  
  
Every Christmas  
Counting the days  
Maybe this year will be different  
And I won't be, be alone again  
  
Under the mistletoe  
Let it snow  
Come on home  
Every Christmas I'll wait  
  
Oh every Christmas  
I turn on all the lights  
And I make a fire so maybe the smoke can clear  
That you're home tonight  
  
But I just don't know (I don't know)  
We'll know deep inside (deep inside)  
I know that you should be here but I feel  
We're running, running out of time  
  
Oh oh every Christmas  
Counting the days  
Maybe this year will be different  
And I won't be, be alone again  
  
Under the mistletoe  
Let it snow  
Come on home  
Every Christmas I'll wait, oh yeah  
  
Under the mistletoe  
Let it snow  
Come on home  
Every Christmas I'll wait  
  
Every Christmas,  
Every Christmas I'll wait

Running around  
Trying to figure out, now  
Where you put your smile down  
You can't let them see you like this  
Thinking what mask you're gonna front  
You grab the nearest one  
You take your place  
  
Amongst these faceless others  
Underneath the surface  
Everything's so backwards  
It's all a lie  
  
[Chorus:]  
Run away  
Save yourself, let it go  
It's too late  
I'm losing you  
You're fading  
  
Don't move  
Sit there in a trance  
Do not make a sound  
Fool, what were you thinking?  
Fallen no one's gonna call  
No hands were up at all  
You're on your own again  
  
Walls are closing in  
You can't feel anything  
Becoming one of them  
Come back to me  
  
[Chorus:]  
Run away  
Save yourself, let it go  
It's too late  
I'm losing you  
You're fading  
  
Fading, fading, fading  
Fading, fading, fading  
  
[Chorus:]  
Run away  
Save yourself, let it go  
It's too late  
I'm losing you  
You're fading away  
  
Save yourself, let it go  
It's too late  
I'm losing you  
You're fading  
  
Fading, fading..

The shame being known as the girl with no name it Droved her insane  
The lie's, rumors, and the blame she couldn't no Longer take the rain

What you see's not what you get  
With you there's just no measurement  
No way to tell what's real from what isn't there  
  
Your eyes they sparkled  
That's all changed into lies that drop like acid rain  
You washed away the best of me  
You don't care  
You know you did it  
  
I'm gone  
To find someone to live for in this world  
There's no light at the end of the tunnel tonight  
Just a bridge that I gotta burn  
You are wrong  
If you think you can walk right through my door  
That is just so you  
Coming back when I've finally moved on  
I'm already gone  
  
Sometimes shattered  
Never open  
Nothing matters  
When you're broken  
That was me whenever I was with you  
  
Always ending, always over  
Back and forth, up and down, like a roller coaster  
I am breaking that habit today  
You know you did it  
  
I'm gone  
To find someone to live for in this world  
There's no light at the end of the tunnel tonight  
Just a bridge that I gotta burn  
You are wrong  
If you think you can walk right through my door  
That is just so you  
Coming back when I've finally moved on  
I'm already gone  
  
There is nothing you can say  
Sorry doesn't cut it babe  
Take the hit and walk away  
'Cause I'm gone  
  
Doesn't matter what you do  
It's what you did that's hurting you  
All I needed was the truth  
Now I'm gone  
  
What you see's not what you get  
What you see's not what you get  
You know you did it  
  
I'm gone  
To find someone to live for in this world  
There's no light at the end of the tunnel tonight  
Just a bridge that I gotta burn  
You are wrong  
If you think you can walk right through my door  
That is just so you  
Coming back when I've finally moved on  
I'm already gone  
I'm already gone  
So I'm already gone gone gone  
So I'm gone  
I'm gone

They say Rome wasn't built in a day  
But you and I went and built it anyway  
And it only took a second to watch it all fall to dust  
I thought you hung up the moon  
And you thought I lit up the room  
But the lights turned off and it was the end of us  
  
[Chorus]  
Slam goes the door  
Hush goes the phone  
Out goes the flame  
And I'm standing here alone  
Burn goes the drink  
Down go the tears  
Drip goes the sink  
And I'm missing you like hell  
Break goes the heart  
Wrong goes the right  
Good goes the bye  
  
It's like we pulled the pin out of a grenade  
It just didn't go off right away  
But man did it go off when it finally did  
Everything's suddenly magnified  
It's loud and it's quiet at the same time  
As the echo of it's all over sets in  
  
[Chorus]  
Slam goes the door  
Hush goes the phone  
Out goes the flame  
And I'm standing here alone  
Burn goes the drink  
Down go the tears  
Drip goes the sink  
And I'm missing you like hell  
Break goes the heart  
Wrong goes the right  
Good goes the bye  
  
I can't go back, we can't be friends  
And we can't be what we were then  
You can't be mine, and I can't be yours  
And it's not love anymore  
  
[Chorus]  
Slam goes the door  
Hush goes the phone  
Out goes the flame  
And I'm standing here alone  
Burn goes the drink  
Down go the tears  
Drip goes the sink  
And I'm missing you like hell  
Break goes the heart  
Wrong goes the right  
Good goes the bye

Louder, louder  
The voices in my head  
Whispers taunting  
All the things you said  
Faster the days go by and I'm still  
Stuck in this moment of wanting you here  
Time  
In the blink of an eye  
You held my hand, you held me tight  
Now you're gone  
And I'm still crying  
Shocked, broken  
I'm dying inside  
  
Where are you?  
I need you  
Don't leave me here on my own  
Speak to me  
Be near me  
I can't survive unless I know you're with me  
  
Shadows linger  
Only to my eye  
I see you, I feel you  
Don't leave my side  
It's not fair  
Just when I found my world  
They took you, they broke you, they tore out your heart  
  
I miss you, you hurt me  
You left with a smile  
Mistaken, your sadness  
Was hiding inside  
Now all that's left  
Are the pieces to find  
The mystery you kept  
The soul behind a guise  
  
Where are you  
I need you  
Don't leave me here on my own  
Speak to me  
Be near me  
I can't survive unless I know you're with me  
  
Why did you go?  
All these questions run through my mind  
I wish I couldn't feel at all  
Let me be numb  
I'm starting to fall  
  
Where are you?  
I need you  
Don't leave me here on my own  
Speak to me  
Be near me  
I can't survive unless I know you're with me  
  
Where are you?  
Where are you?  
  
You were smiling  
You were smiling  
You were smiling

Yes I stumbled into the night  
We're touching but I feel like you're still out of reach  
But people hear a buzzing like a bug on a line  
I'm feeling like I always see them, but they can't see me  
  
Said a man of feelings  
Never get me anywhere  
My heart concern is beating  
Is there anybody, anybody?  
  
[Chorus]  
Hello, hello  
Is anybody listening?  
Let go! It's everyone that's calling me  
Oh oh, won't somebody show me that I'm not alone, not alone  
  
Yeah I'm coming through this desert of stone  
These faces on the statues that I used to know  
Wishing I was more than what my story is told  
Or hoping that I'm dreaming in the day and this isn't happening  
  
Gotta keep it altogether  
Longing for a hand to hold  
Keep clear of the shadows  
Is there anybody, anybody?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Holding on to the memories of when I, I didn't know  
Ignorance isn't wise but it beats being alone  
  
[Chorus: x2]

Tired  
Everything around me  
I smile  
I don't feel a thing no  
  
I'm so far from where I need to be  
I've given up on faith, on everything  
All I want, all I need  
Is some peace  
  
[Chorus:]  
There's a hole  
Inside of me  
It's so cold  
Slowly killing me  
  
Secrets  
Eating at the core of me  
Shut off  
Trusting all the lies I breathe  
  
I'm so far from where I need to be  
I've given up on faith, on everything  
All I wanted, all I needed  
Was some peace  
  
There's a hole  
Inside of me  
It's so damn cold  
Slowly killing me  
  
Sinking ever so slowly  
So far from where I should be  
No hands reaching out for me  
Help me, help me  
  
Something's gone  
I can feel it  
It's all wrong  
I'm so sick of this  
Yeah  
  
[Chorus x2]

Could you love somebody like that?  
Could you attract someone like that?  
Could you go where people can't see someone like me  
Could you do that?  
  
Would you face me  
Make me listen to the truth even if it breaks me  
You can judge me, love me  
If you're hating me  
Do it honestly  
  
All I see are Stepford-like lives  
Needles and knives  
Beautiful lies  
Bringing out the green in your eyes  
A perfect disguise for envy and pride  
  
Face me  
Make me listen to the truth,  
Even if it breaks me  
You can judge me, love me  
  
If you're hating me  
do it honestly  
  
You can tell me  
You can tell me  
You can tell me  
You can tell me  
You can tell me  
  
Face me  
Make me listen to the truth,  
Even if it breaks me  
You can judge me, love me  
If you're hating me  
  
Would you face me  
Make me listen to the truth even if it breaks me  
Judge me, love me  
If you're hating me  
Do it honestly  
  
You can tell me  
You can tell me  
You can tell me  
You can tell me  
  
Do it honestly  
  
You can tell me  
You can tell me  
You can tell me  
You can tell me

Looks like I made a mess again  
Heartbreak everywhere I step  
This fire is getting hot again  
But I touch the flame 'cause I'm a curious cat  
Creeping where I don't belong  
Finding out what I knew all along  
Crying all alone  
And it's all my fault, all my fault  
  
Yeah, I did it again... again  
  
Oh, I'm getting tired of believing  
Even sicker of pretending  
That it's not so bad, just wait it out  
Oh, I think you're feeding me lies again  
The only good man left wasn't him  
And that's how I feel right now so just let me be  
Let me be  
  
It seems every time I find a good man  
He's got a good little wife  
I'm not jealous but I won't lie  
I don't want to hear about your wonderful life  
And babies everywhere I look  
Trophy wives with their little black books  
At this rate I'm gonna end up alone  
It's probably all my fault, all my fault  
  
Oh, another dead end again  
  
Oh, I'm getting tired of believing  
Even sicker of pretending  
That it's not so bad, just wait it out  
Oh, I think you're feeding me lies again  
The only good man left wasn't him  
And that's how I feel right now  
  
Bitter pill that I've swallowed  
Just how low can my heart sink  
Fairy tales from so long ago  
Save them for someone that's not smart enough to know  
  
'Cause I, I'm getting tired of believing  
I'm through pretending  
Yeah I'm broken and sad so I'll sit this one out  
Oh I think you're feeding me lies again  
The only good man left wasn't him  
And that's how I feel right now  
  
How I feel right now  
How I feel right now  
How I feel right now  
Let me be  
  
How I feel right now  
How I feel right now  
How I feel right now  
Let me be

(Kelly)  
Oooh never thought that  
It would come to this always thought  
We would be together forever but fate when  
Changed when you met her.

Oooooh Can't live without you!

I forgive you, I forgive me  
Now when do I start to feel again  
I forgive you, I forgive me  
Now when do I start to feel again  
  
'Cause the lights are on  
But I'm never home  
But I'll be back with a brand new attitude  
'Cause I forgive you  
  
[Chorus]  
I forgive you  
We were just a couple of kids  
Trying to figure out how to live  
Doing it our way  
No shame, no blame  
'Cause the damage is done  
And I forgive you  
I forgive you  
We were busy living the dream  
Never noticed the glass ceiling falling on us  
No shame, no blame  
'Cause the damage is done  
And I forgive you  
  
I forgive you, I forgive me  
Now do I start to feel again  
If I hate you, what does that do  
So I breathe in and I count to 10  
  
'Cause the lights are on  
And I'm coming home  
Yes I am back  
With a new heart in my hand  
'Cause I forgive you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I forgive you  
For every time that I cried  
Over some stupid thing you did to hurt me  
That's alright, yeah I forgive you  
  
I forgive you  
We were just a couple of kids  
Trying to figure out how to live  
Doing it our way  
No shame, no blame  
'Cause the damage is done  
And I forgive you  
  
[Chorus]

If you wanna lead, be a leader  
If you wanna dream, be a dreamer  
Climb to the top of that mountain, scream it  
But remember when you get to the top  
Every thing you say is gonna matter  
Every thing you do is gonna add up  
It's what you asked for, so  
Don't get mad when it's not what you thought  
  
Careful now girl with them Jezebel ways  
Fell on your head, but you're queen of cliches  
Little one playing with the big boys now  
Hope you're ready when it comes back around  
  
I had a dream that we were more  
A generation to behold  
Lighting fires with our words  
Instead of useless smoke that blurs  
The lines of right and wrong  
Expression that lives on  
An army with a song  
That lingers when we're gone  
I had a dream  
  
If you wanna preach, be a preacher  
If you wanna teach, be a teacher  
Remember that the footprints you're leaving  
Will tell us all who you really are  
  
It's too bad you can't see what you're worth  
Spreading your legs instead of using your words  
Character is shown by the things that we do  
The one thing you're never gonna hide is the truth  
  
'Cause anyone can sell when they're selling out  
And anyone can fly when they're falling now  
  
I had a dream that we were more  
A generation to behold  
Lighting fires with our words  
Instead of useless smoke that blurs  
The lines of right and wrong  
Expression that lives on  
An army with a song  
That lingers when we're gone  
I had a dream  
  
I had a dream!  
  
I had a dream that we were more  
A generation to behold  
Lighting fires with our words  
Instead of useless smoke that blurs  
The lines of right and wrong  
Expression that lives on  
An army with a song  
That lingers when we're gone  
I had a dream, I had a dream  
I had a dream, I had a dream

I woke up today  
Woke up wide awake  
In an empty bed  
Staring at an empty room  
I have myself to blame  
For the state I'm in today  
And now dying  
Doesn't seem so cruel  
And oh, I don't know what to say  
And I don't know anyway  
Anymore  
  
I hate myself for losing you  
I'm seeing it all so clear  
I hate myself for losing you  
What do you do when you look in the mirror  
And staring at you is why he's not here?  
  
You got what you deserved  
Hope you're happy now  
'Cause everytime I think of her with you  
It's killing me  
Inside, and  
Now I dread each day  
Knowing that I can't be saved  
From the loneliness  
Of living without you  
And, oh  
I don't know what to do  
Not sure that I'll pull through  
I wish you knew  
  
I hate myself for losing you  
I'm seeing it all so clear  
I hate myself for losing you  
What do you do when you look in the mirror  
And staring at you is why he's not here?  
  
I hate myself for losing you  
And oh, I don't know what to do  
I wish you knew  
And oh, I don't know what to say  
And I don't know anyway  
Anymore  
No, no  
  
I hate myself for losing you  
(I'm seeing it all so clear)  
I'm seeing it all so clear  
I hate myself for losing you  
What do you do when you look in the mirror  
And staring at you is why he's not here?  
What do you say when everything's said?  
Is the reason why he left you in the end?  
How do you cry when every tear you shed  
Won't ever bring him back again?  
I hate myself for loving you

You're no good, heart breaker,  
You're a liar and you're a cheat,  
And I don't know why  
I let you do these things to me.  
  
My friends keep telling me  
That you ain't no good.  
But oh, they don't know  
That I'd leave you if I could.  
  
I guess I'm uptight  
And I'm stuck like glue  
Cause I ain't never  
No, I ain't never, I ain't never loved,  
Loved a man the way that I love you.  
  
Some time ago I thought  
You had run out of fools  
But I was so wrong,  
You got one that you'll never lose.  
The way you treat me is a shame  
How could you hurt me so bad?  
Baby, don't you know that I'm the best thing  
That you'll ever had  
Kiss me once again,  
  
Don't you never, never say that we we're through  
Cause I ain't never  
No, I ain't never, I ain't never loved,  
Loved a man the way that I, I love you.  
  
I can't sleep at night  
And I can't even fight  
I guess I'll never be free  
Since you got your hooks in me.  
  
Whoa, oh, oh  
Yeah! Yeah!  
I ain't never loved a man, baby,  
I ain't never loved a man,  
Ain't never had a man hurt me so bad,  
I ain't never loved a man.

Hot temper with the shortest fuse  
You're such a mess with an attitude  
You working hard but you're paying more  
You never talk 'cause you don't have to  
You got a job but you hate the man  
Who takes it all like Uncle Sam  
  
I want you you you you you you you  
I I I I I I I want you  
  
Out of gas so you walk for miles  
To pick me up in your worn out shoes  
You never settle or never take too much  
You count on me just like I count on you  
Kiss me like when I first saw you  
Figured out couldn't be without you  
  
You you you you you you you  
I I I I I I I want you  
I want you you you you you you you  
I I I I I I I want you  
  
No one else will do  
I want  
No one makes me smile  
I want  
No one gets me how  
I want  
No one else is you you you  
  
I want you you you you you you you  
I I I I I I I want you  
I want you you you you you you you  
I I I I I I I want you  
  
You're so hot tempered with the shortest fuse  
You're such a mess with an attitude  
  
You you you you you you you  
I I I I I I I want you  
I want you you you you you you you  
I I I I I I I want I want I want I want  
  
No one else will do  
I want  
No one makes me smile  
I want  
No one gets me how  
I want  
No one else is you you you  
  
I want you you you you you you you  
I I I I I I I want you  
I want you you you you you you you  
I I I I I I I want you  
I I want you  
  
You and me walking together  
Screwing up for worse or for better  
  
You you you you you you you  
I I I I I I I want you

I should have kissed you  
One last time  
I would have held you  
So much Langer  
If I'd known it'd be the last time  
If I could forget you  
It would make all these memories fade to grey  
I'd rather not remember what I foolishly traded  
  
I think I might be missing you  
Like you said I would  
I think I might have run away  
I'm a fool yeah I'm a fool  
Think I meant I love you  
I said that I don't care  
Wish I could be lonely instead  
  
I should have loved you  
More than I did  
Living without you  
With your ghost and voice haunting my head  
  
I couldn't see you  
And now I see you everyday  
But not with me  
She seems so nice  
She makes you smile  
Like you use to smile at me  
  
I think I might be missing you  
Like you said I would  
I think I might have run away  
I'm a fool yeah I'm a fool  
Think I meant I love you  
I said that I don't care  
Wish I was just lonely instead  
  
You were right  
I'm lying here  
Wishing you were with me  
Hoping that you might be  
Missing me  
Cause I can't seem to fight it honey  
Wish I could erase every part of you ad me  
  
I think I might be missing you  
Like you said I would  
I think I might have run away  
I'm a fool yeah I'm a fool  
Think I meant I love you  
I said that I don't care  
Wish I could be lonely instead  
I wish I was just lonely instead

Hearts break too fast when they're sentimental  
Won't stay won't last when it's love at first sight  
So why are my convictions blinded by your spotlight  
  
Can't breathe can't sleep with some medication  
I'll kiss goodbye to my reservations  
I know there's other fish out in the sea  
Not for me  
I want you  
  
[Chorus]  
If I can't have you then I don't want anyone (I don't want anyone)  
If I can't have you then all the damage has been done baby  
You can break these rules if you wanna have some fun (if you wanna have some
fun)  
Think of all the love that you will lose if I can't have you  
  
Heartbeat cold sweat thoughts slipping under  
Can't fight no threat 'cause there's just no use  
One look, no hesitation  
I'm slipping into you  
  
Forgive these eyes these lips you're tasting  
No time to waste on an invitation  
My shame my self control has suffered enough  
Everybody wants to be loved  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I haven't seen the best that love has had to offer  
They say perfection's always right around the corner  
Could be true  
But if I can't have you  
  
[Chorus]

Maybe no one told you there is strength in your tears  
And so you fight to keep from pouring out  
But what if you unlock the gate that keeps your secret soul  
Do you think that there's enough you might drown?  
  
[Chorus]  
If no one will listen  
If you decide to speak  
If no one is left standing after the bombs explode  
If no one wants to look at you  
For what you really are  
I will be here still  
  
No one can take you where you alone must go  
There's no telling what you will find there  
And, God, I know the fear that eats away at your bones  
It's screaming every step, "Just stay here?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If you find your fists are raw and red from beating yourself down  
If your legs have given out under the weight  
If you find you've been settling for a world of gray  
So you wouldn't have to face down your own hate  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
I will be here still

I can hear it calling in the air tonight  
Can you hear the...  
My body is... , I hear it calling you  
My body is... , I hear it calling you  
  
... street lights, asking to think twice  
You don't wanna relax  
... the night, oh  
I just... walking in street lights  
Can you hear the  
  
Big city, bright lights,... ice  
Fall in love at first sight  
Shawty make me feel like right  
Here was where she was supposed to be  
Hold me,... to me  
... something taking over me  
I gotta get her she bad,  
She's so... my back  
Never met a girl made me feel like that  
No don't think... just found his match  
Feel it, hear it, emotion, feel it  
It's loving, it's spirit, it's sexual, feel it, come on  
  
Starting to loose life I don't wanna loose sight  
Think I will fight things...  
Just wanna be lost in  
...  
Walking in the street lights  
Can you hear the  
I can hear it calling in the air tonight  
Can you hear the...  
I can hear it calling in the air tonight  
Can you hear the...  
My body is... , I hear it calling you  
My body is... , I hear it calling you  
  
Now that I got her, I'm singing...  
... baby leaving with me  
... come on move it  
... hold it, just leave it, come on  
  
... street lights, asking to think twice  
You don't wanna relax  
... the night, oh  
I just... walking in street lights  
Can you hear the  
I can hear it calling in the air tonight  
Can you hear the...  
I can hear it calling in the air tonight  
Can you hear the...  
I can hear it calling in the air tonight  
Can you hear the...  
I can hear it calling in the air tonight  
Can you hear the...  
My body is... , I hear it calling you  
My body is... , I hear it calling you

Some days I barely miss you, some days I'm almost alright  
And some nights I turn to kiss you but you're not beside my side  
Got this same damn conversation playing over and over in my mind  
Yeah my heart is wet and heavy but my body's on the run  
Cause the night is gonna get me and it's only just begun  
I keep livin' on the memory of you and me, you, me in the Sun  
  
No matter where you are  
A little piece of my heart  
Will be forever with you  
In the blue, in the blue  
In a thousand years  
We'll be far from here  
I'll be forever with you  
In the blue, in the blue  
  
Yeah I'm runnin' from this city like a diamond in the sky  
And I'm tryna count my blessings 'stead of all the tears I've cried  
I keep driving in this darkness to get you, to get you off my mind  
I'll start over in a new place, put my feet back on the ground  
Can't believe the mess that I've made, just tryna drown you out  
Baby one day I won't miss you, I'll stop looking for you in the crowd  
  
No matter where you are  
A little piece of my heart  
Will be forever with you  
In the blue, in the blue  
In a thousand years  
We'll be far from here  
I'll be forever with you  
In the blue, in the blue  
  
I see your face in every stranger  
Footsteps down the hall  
Warm breath, back of my neck  
Shadows on the wall  
And your voice is loud as thunder  
I can hear it crashing in my head  
  
No matter where you are  
A little piece of my heart  
Will be forever with you  
In the blue, in the blue  
In a thousand years  
We'll be far from here  
I'll be forever with you  
In the blue, in the blue

You know I was broke down, I had hit the ground  
I was crying out, I couldn't make no sound  
No one hears the silent tears collecting  
You know I had lost hope, I was all alone  
Never been so long till you came along  
Teacher, I feel the dots connecting  
  
Beat down on me, beat down like a waterfall  
Cause I can take on so much more than I had ever dreamed  
So beat down on me, beat down like a waterfall  
Cause baby, I am ready to be free  
  
Now I am invincible  
No, I ain't a scared little girl no more  
Yeah, I am invincible  
What was I running for  
I was hiding from the world  
I was so afraid, I felt so unsure  
Now I am invincible  
Another perfect storm  
  
Now I am a warrior, a shooting star  
Know I got this far, had a broken heart  
No one hears the silent tears collecting  
Cause it's being weak, but strong in the truth I found  
I have courage now, gonna shout it out  
Teacher, I feel the dots connecting  
  
Beat down on me, beat down like a waterfall  
Cause I can take on so much more than I had ever dreamed  
So beat down on me, beat down like a waterfall  
Cause baby, I am ready to be free  
  
Now I am invincible  
No, I ain't a scared little girl no more  
Yeah, I am invincible  
What was I running for  
I was hiding from the world  
I was so afraid, I felt so unsure  
Now I am invincible  
Another perfect storm  
  
I was running from an empty threat  
Of emptiness  
I was running from an empty threat  
That didn't exist  
I was running from an empty threat  
Of abandonment  
I was running from an empty threat  
That didn't exist  
  
Now I am invincible  
No, I ain't a scared little girl no more  
Yeah, I am invincible  
What was I running for  
I was hiding from the world  
I was so afraid, I felt so unsure  
Now I am invincible  
Another perfect storm

[Verse 1]  
There are moments that the words don't reach  
There is suffering too terrible to name  
You hold your child as tight as you can  
Then push away the unimaginable  
The moments when you're in so deep  
Feels easier to just swim down  
And so they move uptown  
And learn to live with the unimaginable  
  
I spend hours in the garden  
I walk alone to the store  
And it's quiet uptown  
I never liked the quiet before  
I take the children to church on Sunday  
A sign of the cross at the door  
And I pray  
That never used to happen before  
  
[Chorus]  
If you see him in the street walking by himself  
Talking to himself, have pity  
You would like it uptown, it's quiet uptown  
He is working through the unimaginable  
His hair has gone grey, he passes every day  
They say he walks the length of the city  
You knock me out, I fall apart  
Can you imagine?  
  
[Verse 2]  
Look at where we are  
Look at where we started  
I know I don't deserve you  
But hear me out, that would be enough  
If I could spare his life  
If I could trade his life for mine  
He'd be standing here right now  
And you would smile  
And that would be enough  
I don't pretend to know  
The challenges we're facing  
I know there's no replacing what we've lost  
And you need time  
But I'm not afraid  
I know who I married  
Just let me stay here by your side  
And that would be enough  
  
[Chorus]  
If you see him in the street, walking by her side  
Talking by her side, have pity  
Do you like it uptown? It's quiet uptown  
He is trying to do the unimaginable  
If you see him walking in the park, long after dark  
Taking in the sights of the city  
Look around, look around, look around  
They are trying to do the unimaginable  
  
[Verse 3]  
There are moments that the words don't reach  
There's a grace too powerful to name  
We push away what we could never understand  
We push away the unimaginable  
They are standing in the garden  
Standing there side by side  
She takes his hand  
It's quiet uptown  
Forgiveness, can you imagine?  
Forgiveness, can you imagine?  
  
[Chorus]  
If you see him in the street, walking by her side  
Talking by her side, have pity  
Look around, look around  
They are going through the unimaginable

The only one who took you in  
The only one who held your hand  
Defended you against the others  
Had your back on everything  
Never let you down  
You turned around betrayed your only brother  
  
Forgetting me, you took things in your hands and left me out  
After we'd been through so much, how could you let me down?  
  
I didn't know, I didn't know  
I couldn't see, I couldn't see  
Never thought you'd forget me  
Couldn't believe, couldn't believe  
How you deceived, you deceived  
I never thought you'd do that to me  
  
I will never be like you  
I'll never do the things you do  
Selfish and lonely, what's your problem  
Letting go of you and this  
Is harder than I thought but I will not be poisoned by your actions  
  
Forgetting me, you took things in your hands and left me out  
After we'd been through so much, how could you let me down?  
  
I didn't know, I didn't know  
I couldn't see, I couldn't see  
Never thought you'd forget me  
Couldn't believe, couldn't believe  
How you deceived, you deceived  
I never thought you'd do that to me  
  
Forgetting me, you took things in your hands and left me out  
After we'd been through so much, how could you let me down?  
Down, you let me down

Just for now  
Just for now  
  
It's that time of year  
Leave all our hopelessnesses aside  
If just for a little while  
Tears stop right here  
I know we've all had a bumpy ride  
I'm secretly on your side  
  
Well how did you know? It's what I always wanted  
Could never have had too many of these  
Will you quit kicking me under the table?  
I'm trying, will somebody make us shut up about it  
Can we settle down please  
  
It's that time of year  
Leave all our hopelessnesses aside  
If just for a little while  
Tears stop right here  
I know we've all had a bumpy ride  
I'm secretly on your side  
  
Bite tongue, deep breaths  
Count to ten, nod your head  
  
I think something is burning  
Now you've ruined the whole thing  
Oh muffle the smoke alarm  
Whoever put on this music  
Better quick, sharp, remove it  
Pour me another, oh, don't wag your finger at me  
  
It's that time of year  
Leave all our hopelessnesses aside  
If just for a little while  
Tears stop right here  
I know we've all had a bumpy ride  
I'm secretly on your side  
  
Get get me out of here  
Get get me out of here  
Get me out of here  
  
Get get me out of here  
Get get me out of here  
Get me out of here  
  
Just for now  
Just for now  
Just for now  
  
Just for now  
Just for now  
  
Just for now  
Just for now  
  
Just for now  
Please  
Just for now  
Please

Roll over baby, the time has come  
to make a little bit more room  
I've hung around you, it's getting tough  
I think I'm gonna break down soon  
  
I remember, crying in the park, it was getting dark  
Suddenly I looked up  
You were my sky  
So go on and  
Sleep darling  
Why don't you pretend we were just a dream  
It's cool baby  
It doesn't matter anyway  
I'm so sorry  
We got to the station a little too late  
It's such a shame  
We just missed the train  
  
Be quiet angel, don't make a sound  
Save it for a rainy day  
Oh can't you see me, I'm such a mess  
trying hard to find my way  
  
Do you remember, wasting all that time, we were feeling fine  
Though we couldn't walk a line  
We were alright  
  
So go on and  
Sleep darling  
Why don't you pretend we were just a dream  
It's cool baby  
It doesn't matter anyway  
I'm so sorry  
We got to the station a little too late  
It's such a shame  
We just missed the train  
  
Oh, why'd that train just pass us by  
Didn't anyone see  
We were stuck at the light  
Or we would've made it on time  
  
So sleep darling  
Why don't you pretend we were just a dream  
It's cool baby  
It doesn't matter anyway  
I'm so sorry  
We got to the station a little too late  
It's such a shame  
We just missed the train

I think I might be a fortune teller  
I read your face just like a letter  
The funny thing about forever  
Is it comes with a side of never never  
  
I can't buy into what you're selling  
And no it's not that I don't want it  
Believe me I love to close my eyes, enjoy the ride  
But you reek of bad decisions and I  
  
I know, I know, I know,  
I know, I know, I know  
  
[Chorus]  
You're only gonna let me down  
When it counts, you countdown  
You're only gonna turn me out  
As I burn, you burn out  
You're only gonna make me feel so crazy  
But when I think we could be something  
You go and let me down, let me down, oh  
  
I am too smart to let you in here  
But I'm just dumb enough to linger  
I wanna think that you'll be different  
Smoking mirrors are so clever clever  
  
I picked him and things went so bad  
Then what you say will actually happen  
I've been dying to open my eyes  
See you try instead of always leaving me out to dry  
  
I know, I know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I need you to be there when you say you're gonna be  
I care too much and you care enough to leave  
I want some place to rest my head without worrying  
It's not fair, it's not fair, it's not fair, it's not fair  
It's not fair to me, 'cause I know by now  
  
[Chorus: x2]

I felt it, the wire touched my neck  
And then someone pulled it tighter  
I never saw it coming, I started to black out  
And then someone said good morning  
I took it as a warning  
I should have seen it coming  
So now I'll take a chance on  
  
This thing we may have started  
Intentional or not, I don't think we saw it coming  
It's all adding up to something  
That asks for some involvement  
That ask for our commitment  
I think I see it coming  
If we step out of that limb  
  
My heart beat beats me senselessly  
Why's everything got to be so intense with me  
I'm trying to handle all this unpredictability  
In all probability  
  
It's a long shot, but I say why not  
If I say forget it, I know that I'll regret it  
It's a long shot just to beat these odds  
The chance is we won't make it  
But I know if I don't take it, there's no chance  
'Cause you're the best I got  
So take a long shot  
  
I realize that there is all this starting  
Things we're both scared about  
That we'll never see them coming  
Throw caution to the wind  
And we'll see which way it's blowing  
And to this pulling on  
We'll never see it coming  
Until it's much to close to stop  
  
My heart beat beats me senselessly  
Why's everything got to be so intense with me  
I'm trying to handle all this unpredictability  
In all probability  
  
It's a long shot, but I say why not  
If I say forget it, I know that I'll regret it  
It's a long shot just to beat these odds  
The chance is we won't make it  
But I know if I don't take it, there's no chance  
'Cause you're the best I got  
So take a long shot  
  
Oh I waited for fact to come of fiction  
And you fit my description  
I never saw you coming  
But we'll make it  
  
It's a long shot, but I say why not  
If I say forget it, I know that I'll regret it  
It's a long shot just to beat these odds  
The chance is we won't make it  
But I know if I don't take it, there's no chance, no chance  
'Cause you're the best I got  
  
It's a long shot but I say why not  
If I say forget it I know that I'll regret it  
It's a long shot just to beat these odds  
The chance is we won't make it  
But I know if I don't take it  
It's a long shot but I say why not  
Oh you never saw me coming

I think you've touched my hand  
Or maybe hurt me again  
What did you say that made me blush  
I think you laughed at me  
First dates are always fun  
I think that when I fell in love  
  
First kiss first moment that I knew  
First time you said I love you  
First day I started to forget  
I still have all your pictures  
Sometimes I do remember  
You come and go like all the rest  
  
It's been so long since I left  
I can't remember my way back  
I'm so lost, I'm so lost  
No where to go walkin' alone  
Without your love I have no home  
I'm so lost, I'm so lost  
  
Sometimes I get a glance of  
You and me and we're dancin'  
As if things they never change  
You hold me closer to you  
I watch you fade and soon you  
You just, you slip away  
  
Cause, It's been so long since I left  
I can't remember my way back  
I'm so lost, I'm so lost  
No where to go walkin' alone  
Without your love I have no home  
I'm so lost, I'm so lost  
  
(Ahh ah ah ah ah ah ah ah)  
(Ahh ah ah ah ah ah ah ah)  
(Ahh ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ahhhhhh)  
  
It's been so long since I left  
I can't remember my way back  
I'm so lost, I'm so lost  
No where to go walkin' alone  
Without your love I have no home  
I'm so lost, I'm so lost  
  
Cause, it's been so long since I left  
I can't remember my way back  
I'm so lost, I'm so lost  
No where to go walkin' alone  
Without your love I have no home  
I'm so lost, I'm so lost

Everybody's talking  
But they don't say a thing  
They look at me with sad eyes  
But I don't want their sympathy  
It's cool you didn't want me  
Sometimes you can't go back  
By why'd you have to go  
And make a mess like that  
Well I just have to say before I let go  
  
Have you ever been low  
Have you ever had a friend that let you down so  
When the truth came out  
Were you the last to know  
Were you left out in the cold  
'Cause what you did was low  
  
No I don't need your number  
There's nothing left to say  
'Cept I never thought it'd  
Hurt this much to be saved  
My friends are outside waiting  
I've gotta go  
  
Have you ever been low  
Have you ever had a friend that let you down so  
When the truth came out  
Were you the last to know  
Were you left out in the cold  
'Cause what you did was low  
What you did was low  
What you did was low  
What you did was low  
  
I walk out of this darkness  
With no sense of regret  
And I go with a clear conscience  
We both know that you can't say that  
This to show for all the time I loved you so  
  
Have you ever been low  
Have you ever had a friend that let you down so  
When the truth came out  
Were you the last to know  
Were you left out in the cold  
'Cause what you did was low  
  
Have you ever been low  
Have you ever had a friend that let you down so  
When the truth came out  
Were you the last to know  
Were you left out in the cold  
'Cause what you did was low  
  
Have you ever been low  
Have you ever had a friend that let you down so  
'Cause what you did was low

Mr Know It All  
Well ya think you know it all  
But ya don't know a thing at all  
Ain't it something y'all  
When somebody tells you something bout you  
Think that they know you more than you do  
So you take it down another pill to swallow  
  
Mr bring me down  
Well ya like to bring me down don't ya  
But I ain't laying down, baby

Can't nobody tell me how it's gonna be  
Nobody gonna make a fool out of me  
Baby you should know that I lead not follow  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh you think that you know me, know me  
That's why I'm leaving you lonely, lonely  
'Cause baby you don't know a thing about me  
You don't know a thing about me  
You ain't got the right to tell me  
When and where to go, no right to tell me  
Acting like you own me lately  
Yeah baby you don't know a thing about me  
You don't know a thing about me  
  
Mr Play Your Games  
Only got yourself to blame  
When you want me back again  
But I ain't falling back again  
'Cause I'm living my truth without your lies  
Let's be clear baby this is goodbye  
I ain't coming back tomorrow  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So what, you've got the world at your feet  
And you know everything about everything  
But you don't  
You still think I'm coming back but baby you'll see

Mr Know It All  
Well ya think you know it all  
But ya don't know a thing at all  
Yeah baby you don't know a thing about me

Lately I just don't... Everything  
But some secrets I meant to keep  
So rest and sure that I ain't listening  
I keep my head down so I can't see anything  
What I don't know can't hurt  
  
Chorus  
Cause you are my escape from everything  
In this place be my holiday  
Love it and...  
You are my escape  
You are my escape  
... Just like the movie  
  
Some say that ignorance is best  
Well I am the one to disagree  
If there ain't love...  
Lately I just don't... Everything  
But some secrets I meant to keep  
So rest and sure that I ain't listening  
Close the door and keep on continuing  
But I what I don't know can't hurt  
  
Cause you are my escape from everything  
... Everything  
I am in this place... Love it...  
You are my escape oh nu  
You are my escape  
Let's keep it just like the movie  
  
You are like a good book I get lost in  
The perfect place to run and hide away  
Don't wanna pressure you to the next chapter  
Cause I don't know how it ends  
  
Chorus  
Cause you are my escape from everything  
In this place be my holiday  
Love it and...  
You are my escape  
You are my escape  
Let's keep it just like the movie

Do you remember me  
I sat upon your knee  
I wrote to you with childhood fantasies  
Well I'm all grown up now  
And still need help somehow  
I'm not a child but my heart still can dream  
  
So here's my lifelong wish  
My grown up Christmas list  
Not for myself but for a world in need  
No more lives torn apart  
That wars would never start  
And time would heal all hearts  
And everyone would have a friend  
And right would always win  
And love would never end, no  
This is my grown up Christmas list  
  
As children we believe  
The grandest sight to see  
Was something lovely wrapped beneath the tree  
But Heaven only knows  
That packages and bows  
Can never heal a heartached human soul  
  
No more lives torn apart  
That wars would never start  
And time would heal all hearts  
And everyone would have a friend  
And right would always win  
And love would never end, no  
This is my grown up Christmas list  
  
What is this illusion called the innocence of youth  
Maybe only in our blind belief can we ever find the truth  
  
No more lives torn apart  
That wars would never start  
And time would heal all hearts  
And everyone would have a friend  
And right would always win  
And love would never end, no  
This is my grown up Christmas list  
This is my only lifelong wish  
This is my grown up Christmas list

Guess this means you're sorry  
You're standing at my door  
Guess this means you take back  
All you said before  
Like how much you wanted  
Anyone but me  
Said you'd never come back  
But here you are again  
  
'Cause we belong together now, yeah  
Forever united here somehow, yeah  
You got a piece of me  
And honestly  
My life (my life) would suck (would suck) without you  
  
Maybe I was stupid  
For telling you goodbye  
Maybe I was wrong  
For tryin' to pick a fight  
I know that I've got issues  
But you're pretty messed up too  
Either way I found out I'm nothing without you  
  
'Cause we belong together now, yeah  
Forever united here somehow, yeah  
You got a piece of me  
And honestly  
My life (my life) would suck (would suck) without you  
  
Being with you is so dysfunctional  
I really shouldn't miss you  
But I can't let you go  
Oh yeah  
  
'Cause we belong together now, yeah yeah  
Forever united here somehow, yeah  
You got a piece of me  
And honestly  
My life (my life) would suck (would suck) without you  
  
'Cause we belong (yeah) together now (together now), (yeah)  
Forever united here somehow, yeah  
You got a piece of me and honestly  
My life (my life) would suck (would suck) without you

Looking out on the morning rain  
  
I used to feel so uninspired  
  
And when I knew I had to face another day  
  
Lord, it made me feel, made me feel so tired  
  
Before the day I met you, life was so unkind  
  
But you're the key to my peace of mind  
  
  
  
'cause you make me feel  
  
You make feel  
  
You make me feel like  
  
A natural woman  
  
  
  
Oh, baby, what you've done to me  
  
Ooh, you make me feel so good inside  
  
And I just don't want to be close to you  
  
You make me feel so aliive  
  
  
  
You make feel  
  
You make me feel like  
  
A natural woman

I hope the ring you gave to her  
Turns her finger green  
I hope when you're in bed with her  
You think of me  
I would never wish bad things  
But I don't wish you well  
Could you tell  
By the flames that burned your words  
I never read your letter  
'Cause I knew what you'd say  
Give me that Sunday school answer  
Try make it all OK  
  
[Chorus:]  
Does it hurt  
To know I'll never be there  
But it sucks  
To see my face everywhere  
It was you  
Who chose to end it like you did  
I was the last to know  
You knew  
Exactly what you would do  
And don't say  
You simply lost your way  
She may believe you  
But I never will  
Never again  
  
If she really knows the truth  
She deserves you  
A trophy wife, oh, how cute  
Ignorance is bliss  
But when your day comes  
And he's through with you  
And he'll be through with you  
You'll die together, but alone  
You wrote me in a letter  
You couldn't say it right to my face  
Well, give me that Sunday school answer  
Repent yourself away  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Never again will I hear you  
Never again will I miss you  
Never again will I fall to you  
Never  
Never again will I kiss you  
Never again will I want to  
Never again will I love you  
Never  
  
Does it hurt  
To know I'll never be there  
But it sucks  
To see my face everywhere  
It was you  
Who chose to end it like you did  
I was the last to know  
You knew  
Exactly what you would do  
And don't say  
You simply lost your way  
They may believe you  
But I never will  
I never will  
I never will  
Never again

O' Holy night, the stars are brightly shining  
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth  
Long lay the world  
In sin and error pining  
'Til He appeared and the soul felt His worth  
  
The thrill of hope,  
The weary world rejoices  
For yonder brings a new and glorious morn  
  
Fall on your knees  
Oh, hear the angel's voices  
O' night divine  
O' night when Christ was born  
O' night divine  
O' night,  
O' night divine  
  
O' Holy night, the stars are brightly shining  
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth  
Oh...  
Long lay the world  
In sin and error pining  
'Til He appeared and the soul felt His worth  
  
The thrill of hope,  
The weary world rejoices  
For yonder brings a new and glorious morn  
  
Fall on your knees  
Oh, hear the angel's voices  
O' night divine  
O' night when Christ was born  
O' night divine  
O' night,  
O' night di...divine

You're going crazy  
Running on empty  
You can't make up your mind  
You try to hide it  
But you had to say it  
Restless all this time  
So completely drained from everything that's in your life  
It's so wrong but you had to scream every thought you kept inside  
  
[Chorus:]  
One minute you laugh  
The next minute you're slowly sinking into something black  
I get the feeling that lately nothing ever really lasts  
I keep trying to get up but I keep falling back  
And you love  
And you hate  
And you wait  
'Cause one minute goes fast  
  
You just can't escape it  
You're losing patience  
You wonder what went wrong  
Everything changes  
Happy then jaded  
Always a different song  
Playin' in your head just when you think you got it down  
Out of nowhere you realize it's different music playing now  
  
[Chorus]  
  
One minute goes fast  
One minute goes fast  
  
One minute you laugh  
The next minute you're slowly sinking into something black  
I get the feeling that lately nothing ever really lasts  
I keep trying to get up but I keep falling back  
And you love  
And you hate  
And you wait  
'Cause one minute goes  
One minute goes  
One minute goes fast

Lying beside you.  
Here in the dark  
Feeling your heart beat  
With mine  
Softly you whisper  
You're so sincere  
How could our love  
Be so blind  
  
We sailed on together  
We drifted apart  
So here you are by my side  
  
[Chorus:]  
So now I come to you  
With open arms  
Nothing to hide  
Believe what I say  
Here I am  
With open arms  
Hoping you'll see  
What your love means to me  
Open arms  
  
Living without you  
Living alone  
This empty house seems so cold  
Wanting to hold you  
Wanting you near  
How much I wanted you home  
  
But now that you've come back  
Turned night into day  
I need you to stay  
  
[Chorus:]

[Intro]  
And all I remember is your back  
Walking towards the airport leaving us all in your past  
I traveled 1,500 miles to see you  
Begged you to want me  
But you didn't want to  
  
[Chorus]  
But piece by piece you collected me  
Up off the ground but you abandoned things  
And piece by piece you filled the holes that you burned in me  
At six years old and no  
He never walks away  
He never asks for money  
He takes care of me  
He loves me  
Piece by piece  
He restored my faith  
That a man can be kind  
And a father could stay  
  
[Verse 1]  
And all of your words fall flat  
I made something of myself and now you wanna come back  
But your love isn't free  
It has to be earned  
Back then I didn't have anything you needed  
So, I was worthless  
  
[Chorus]  
But piece by piece you collected me  
Up off the ground but you abandoned things  
And piece by piece you filled the holes that you burned in me  
At six years old and no  
He never walks away  
He never asks for money  
He takes care of me  
He loves me  
Piece by piece  
He restored my faith  
That a man can be kind  
And a father could stay  
  
[Hook]  
Piece by piece...  
  
[Verse 2]  
Piece by piece I fell far from the tree  
I would never leave her like you left me  
She will never have to wonder her worth  
Because unlike you I'm gonna put her first  
He'll never walk away  
He'll never break her heart  
He'll take care of things  
He'll love her  
Piece by piece  
He restored my faith  
That a man can be kind  
And a father should be great  
  
[Hook]  
Piece by piece...  
Piece by piece...

:  
  
Well won't you listen baby  
To what I wanna say  
I'm so crazy 'bout you  
I don't wanna play  
  
[Chorus:]  
I wanna be loved  
Be loved by you  
I wanna be loved  
Be loved by you  
  
You clawed your way to the top  
I don't care if you're a flop  
I'll do what I gotta do  
To take care of you  
  
I wanna be loved  
Be loved by you  
I wanna be loved  
Be loved by you  
  
[Chorus: Repeat x2]  
  
You can change my eye  
You can change your time  
You can do what you want  
You better read between the lines  
  
I wanna be loved  
Be loved by you  
I wanna be loved  
Be loved by you  
  
[Chorus: Repeat x2]

Frozen, forgetful again  
The part where I lose my head  
The scene where I'm supposed to speak but instead  
I sit and listen again,  
I'm stuck with these cards I guess  
  
Leaping from this cliff in my thoughts  
I fly like the stones in my heart  
Drowning in doubt for what reason  
I sit so patiently  
Drenched in what you want me to be  
I can't escape  
  
I'm ready now oh I'm ready now  
Oh I'm ready now come get me  
  
Fearless with cape in hand  
Conquer what I need to to mend  
Little girls get so broken  
But I sit so patiently drenched in what you want me to be  
I can't see no escape  
  
I'm ready now oh I'm ready now  
Oh I'm ready now come get me  
  
Through with golden roads and perfect love  
Too much of your mouth is like too much sun  
How I burn, how I burn  
I was so patient, waiting for my turn  
Fly like stone  
As I break every bone  
Come get me  
  
I'm ready now oh I'm ready now  
Oh I'm ready now come get me  
  
I'm ready now oh I'm ready now  
Oh I'm ready now come get me

What you are  
Baby I got it  
What you need  
'cause baby you know I got it  
All I'm asking  
Is for respect when you get home  
Yea baby  
When you get home  
Just a little bit  
  
I ain't gonna do you wrong  
When your gone  
Ain't gonna do you wrong  
'cause I don't want to  
All I want you to do for me is respect when you get home  
Alright now

All my money

And guess what

Alright now

And try to change this.  
But nothing I can say,  
Would change anything.  
  
Where were my senses?  
I left them all behind.  
Why did I turn away, away?  
  
I wish I could save you.  
I wish I could say to you,  
I'm not going nowhere.  
I wish I could say to you,  
It's gonna be alright,  
It's gonna be alright.  
  
I didn't mean,  
Didn't mean,  
To leave you stranded.  
Went away cause I,  
Didn't want to face the truth.  
Reaching out,  
Reach for me,  
Empty handed.  
You don't know if I care.  
You're trying to find the proof.  
  
There were times I'd wonder,  
Could I have eased your pain?  
Why did I turn away, away?  
  
I wish I could save you.  
I wish I could say to you,  
I'm not going nowhere.  
I wish I could say to you,  
It's gonna be alright,  
It's gonna be alright,  
It's gonna be alright,  
It's gonna be alright.  
  
We can pretend nothing's changed.  
Pretend it's all the same.  
And there will be no pain,  
Tonight.  
It's gonna be alright,  
It's gonna be alright,  
It's gonna be alright,  
It's gonna be alright.  
  
I'm not going nowhere.  
I wish I could say to you,  
It's gonna be alright,  
It's gonna be alright,  
It's gonna be alright,  
It's gonna be alright,  
It's gonna be alright.

Why do we build up all these idols  
Just to watch 'em fall?  
You're wearin' the crown, toast of the town  
And no one takes your call  
  
Yeah maybe I've been down, down, down, down  
But I always come back around, 'round, 'round, 'round  
  
You can't forget about me  
While you weren't lookin' I was gettin' even higher  
Say what you want about me  
Your words are gasoline on my fire  
You can hate me, underestimate me  
Do what you do cause what you do don't phase me  
Just when you think I'm at the end  
Any second I'ma catch my second wind  
  
An airplane's only paper 'til it finds a breeze  
But don't you know that it's the low that makes the high so sweet?  
When they try to break, break, break you  
That's when you get your break, break, breakthrough  
  
You can't forget about me  
While you weren't lookin' I was gettin' even higher  
Say what you want about me  
Your words are gasoline on my fire  
You can hate me, underestimate me  
Do what you do cause what you do don't phase me  
Just when you think I'm at the end  
Any second I'ma catch my second wind  
  
Yeah maybe I've been down, down, down, down  
But I always come back around, 'round, 'round, 'round  
  
You can't forget about me  
While you weren't lookin' I was gettin' even higher  
Say what you want about me  
Your words are gasoline on my fire  
You can hate me, underestimate me  
Do what you do cause what you do don't phase me  
Just when you think I'm at the end  
Any second I'ma catch my second wind

Here's the thing  
We started out friends  
It was cool, but it was all pretend  
Yeah, yeah  
Since you been gone  
  
You're dedicated, you took the time  
Wasn't long till I called you mine  
Yeah, yeah  
Since you been gone  
  
And all you'd ever hear me say  
Is how I picture me with you  
That's all you'd ever hear me say  
  
But since you been gone  
I can breathe for the first time  
I'm so moving on  
Yeah, yeah  
Thanks to you  
Now I get what I want  
Since you been gone  
  
How can I put it? You put me on  
I even fell for that stupid love song  
Yeah, yeah  
Since you been gone  
  
How come I've never heard you say  
I just want to be with you?  
Guess you never felt that way  
  
But since you been gone  
I can breathe for the first time  
I'm so moving on  
Yeah, yeah  
Thanks to you  
Now I get what I want  
Since you been gone  
  
You had your chance, you blew it  
Out of sight, out of mind  
Shut your mouth, I just can't take it  
Again, and again, and again, and again  
  
Since you been gone (since you been gone)  
I can breathe for the first time  
I'm so moving on  
Yeah, yeah  
Thanks to you (thanks to you)  
Now I get, I get what I want  
  
I can breathe for the first time  
I'm so moving on  
Yeah, yeah  
Thanks to you (thanks to you), now I get (I get)  
You should know (you should know)  
That I get  
I get what I want  
Since you been gone  
Since you been gone  
Since you been gone

My life has been full of mistakes and regrets for that I know  
But without you I feel so cold  
I'm an idiot for making the mistakes I did but will you forgive me?  
Will you forgive me, my love please forgive me.  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Coz since we've met  
There is something in my life worth fighting for  
God never thought I'd actually find it  
But here it is  
Here you are  
Since we've met  
I found myself more then I ever could of  
God bless your soul, God bless your soul...  
  
Your life I'm not to certain about the regrets I know of  
But with you not here I can't see clear  
You found me on that day tattered and ever so lonely  
And gave me a little smirk  
So please be with me, be with me. My love be with me.  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
What would I do without you?  
Probably die.  
What would I be without you?  
A lonely soul  
Guys have jerked me round before and I'm well over it but with you here you
break my fall.  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Oooooooh yeah. Woaaaaah.  
Be mine, be mine, be mine.  
Since we've met  
I... Am... Me.

You closed every door right in my face  
You chose to ignore my presence in this place  
You thought I'd never make it without you  
And now you're watching me from your living room  
  
You left me on the outside looking in  
You saw me as a risk not worth takin'  
You slammed the door before you could realize  
Behind this average girl there's a fire inside  
  
Hear me, I bet you hear me now  
See me, you're seein' clearer now aren't you?  
Treat me a little better now  
Now that I'm here who's lookin' down on who now?  
  
You led me to think I was a fool  
The only words from you were 'stupid little girl'  
You tried your best to kill my hopes and my dreams  
Too bad you couldn't see the strength inside me  
  
You pushed and pushed me out, thinking you'd win  
Feeding me lies about a world I'd never fit in  
Why would I ever wanna just fit in?  
I know I'm better than that  
I'm something worth remembering  
  
Hear me, I bet you hear me now  
See me, you're seein' clearer now aren't you?  
Treat me a little better now  
Now that I'm here who's lookin' down on who now?  
  
Hear me creepin' through your stereo  
See me, not bad for a small town girl  
You can't escape me, I'm all around  
Everywhere you turn, my voice, my face, my sound  
  
Hear me, I bet you hear me now  
See me, you're seein' clearer now  
Treat me a little better now  
Now that I'm here who's lookin'...  
  
Hear me  
See me, you're seein' clearer now  
Treat me a little, a little better now  
Now that I'm here who's lookin' down on who now?  
  
Hear me  
See me  
Treat me, you're treatin' me better now  
Now that I'm here who's lookin' down on who now?

I don't know  
This could break my heart or save me  
Nothing's real  
Until you let go completely  
So here I go with all my thoughts I've been saving  
So here I go with all my fears weighing on me  
  
Three months and I'm still sober  
Picked all my weeds but kept the flowers  
But I know it's never really over  
  
I don't know  
I could crash and burn but maybe  
At the end of this road I might catch a glimpse of me  
So I won't worry about my timing I wanna get it right  
No comparing  
Second guessing  
No, not this time  
  
Three months and I'm still breathing  
Been a long road since those hands I left my tears in but I know  
It's never really over, no  
  
Wake up  
  
Three months and I'm still standing here  
Three months and I'm getting better yeah  
Three months and I still am  
  
Three months and it's still harder now  
Three months I've been living here without you now  
Three months yeah, three months  
  
Three months and I'm still breathing  
Three months and I still remember it  
Three months and I wake up  
  
Three months and I'm still sober  
Picked all my weeds but kept the flowers

Prayed for an angel  
To come in the night  
And shine some sweet light on me  
Found only strangers  
Then you came to me  
Just when I'd given up, you gave me love  
My world was tumbling down  
You turned it around baby  
  
[Chorus]  
You, you're some kind of miracle  
You are, you're a miracle to me  
  
Sweet revelation  
That look in your eyes  
Your touch in the night  
I find the sweetest salvation  
In your arms baby  
Warm as the morning sun, your tender love  
Came and just lifted me up  
Look what you've done baby  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You brought joy to my heart  
I found love in your arms  
See what you've done to me  
You set my soul so free  
You came and you gave me the love that I need  
  
You, you're some kind of miracle  
You are, you're a miracle, a miracle to me  
Baby you are, a miracle to me

Ooh ooh yeahhh  
Hit it  
Boy don't think for  
A second that I forgot  
About you cause I didn't.  
But after I woke up and you  
Were gone and I didn't understand  
Why. Was it something I said? Was it  
Something I did? Ohh I need to  
Know but boy just so you know  
  
(Chours)  
Someday I will find you  
And ask you why you left me  
Broken hearted but boy oh boy  
Don't you that someday oh someday  
I will find you yehhh.  
  
Boy I have been searching  
Everywhere for you but I can't  
Seem to find you anywhere it's like  
You didn't exist but to me and I will  
Do anyhthing to find you  
(Chours)  
Someday I will find you  
And ask you why you left me  
Broken hearted but boy oh boy  
Don't you that someday oh someday  
I will find you yehhh.  
  
Boy it's like you where a dream  
Like everything that happened between  
Us didn't happen but I know that in my  
Heart oh in my heart that we will  
Be together forever cause  
  
(2nd Chours)  
Cause I found you and  
Now my broken heart is mended  
And we can go on living with each  
Other cause that someday was today yeahhhhhh  
Ohhhhh yeahhh someday was today  
  
(Chours)  
Someday I will find you  
And ask you why you left me  
Broken hearted but boy oh boy  
Don't you that someday oh someday  
I will find you yehhh.  
(2nd Chours)  
Cause I found you and  
Now my broken heart is mended  
And we can go on living with each  
Other cause that someday was today yeahhhhhh  
Ohhhhh yeahhh someday was today  
  
Boy oh boy that someday is today....  
  
I found you.

So this is my apology  
For saying all those shitty things  
I wish I didn't really mean  
I'm sorry I'm not sorry  
You had your red flags up and raised  
More traffic than east L.A  
But I drove in anyway  
My common sense on holiday  
  
People fall out of phase  
We were a crashed cause  
We were just, be a place, stuck on your passport  
You travel to some time  
But I hope you'll find  
  
Someone to cry for  
Someone to try for  
Someone to turn your crooked roads into her streets  
Someone to fight for  
Someone to die for  
Someone whose arms will hold you tight enough to be  
The reason you breathe  
  
Be the reason you breathe  
  
You stay in love like vacation homes  
You like summer on the sunny coast  
But when the cold need a winter coat  
You say you will until you don't  
You wore a comb fist around your neck  
A different north in the ever end  
What did you get where you going yet  
We're sure the worst, we're sure the best  
  
I don't know how I fell into your rear view  
Paralyzed, alibi, I couldn't hear you  
So I hope you were right  
And I see you tonight  
With  
  
Someone to cry for  
Someone to try for  
Someone to turn your crooked roads into her streets  
Someone to fight for  
Someone to die for  
Someone whose arms will hold you tight enough to be  
The reason you breathe  
  
Be the reason you breathe  
  
So this is my apology  
For saying all those shitty things  
I wish I didn't really mean  
I'm sorry I'm not sorry

Oh! Say, can you see,  
By the dawns early light,  
What so proudly we hailed  
At the twilight's last gleaming?  
Whose broad stripes and bright stars,  
Thru' the perilous flight,  
O'er the ramparts we watched  
Were so gallantly streaming?  
And the rockets' red glare,  
The bombs bursting in air,  
Gave proof thro' the night  
That our flag was still there.  
Oh! Say, does that star spangled banner  
Yet wave.  
O'er the land of the free  
And the home of the brave.

[Verse 1]  
You know the bed feels warmer  
Sleeping here alone  
You know I dream in color  
And do the things I want!  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
You think you've got the best of me  
Think you've had the last laugh  
Bet you think that everything good is gone  
Think you left me broken down  
Think that I'd come running back  
Baby, you don't know me, 'cause you're dead wrong  
  
[Chorus]  
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger  
Stand a little taller  
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone  
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter  
Footsteps even lighter  
Doesn't mean I'm over 'cause you're gone  
  
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger  
Just me, myself and I  
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger  
Stand a little taller  
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone  
  
[Verse 2]  
You heard that I was starting over with someone new  
They told you I was moving on, over you  
You didn't think that I'd come back  
I'd come back swinging  
You tried to break me, but you see  
  
[Chorus]  
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger  
Stand a little taller  
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone  
What doesn't kill you makes you fighter  
Footsteps even lighter  
Doesn't mean I'm over 'cause you're gone  
  
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger  
Just me, myself and I  
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger  
Stand a little taller  
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone  
  
[Bridge]  
Thanks to you I got a new thing started  
Thanks to you I'm not the broken-hearted  
Thanks to you I'm finally thinking 'bout me  
You know in the end the day you left is just my beginning  
In the end  
  
[Chorus]  
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger  
Stand a little taller  
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone  
What doesn't kill you makes you fighter  
Footsteps even lighter  
Doesn't mean I'm over 'cause you're gone  
  
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger  
Just me, myself and I  
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger  
Stand a little taller  
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone  
  
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger  
Just me, myself and I  
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger  
Stand a little taller  
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone  
  
[Outro]  
I'm not alone

[Kelly]

To describe it. It's there  
Inside all I do is hide it. I'm  
Not sure why I feel this way  
But I have had enough. So please  
Just come and

All the thoughts I have of you.  
Take me away from all the love I  
Used to have for you oh oh ohx2  
Take me away.

Won't go away. Sometimes

To carry oh....

[Repeat till fade]

Let's go  
  
What happened to the man who used to take me straight into misery  
I want you back and now I must admit it shames me  
How could this be?  
Tell me what's this desperation  
'Cause I don't recognize, he's changed  
I think I made a bad mistake  
  
'Cause once I ran away  
I love you since the day, the day I broke your heart  
It's more than I could take  
I love you since the day, the day we fell apart  
Now everything is coming undone  
'Cause you were the chance I can't afford to waste  
I love you since the day, the day we fell apart  
  
I must admit the grass is so much greener on the other side  
Since you left I noticed now you're so much meaner  
And it's something I think I like  
Tell me what's this desperation  
'Cause I don't recognize, he's changed  
I think I made a bad mistake  
  
'Cause once I ran away  
I love you since the day, the day I broke your heart  
It's more than I could take  
I love you since the day, the day we fell apart  
Now everything is coming under  
'Cause you were the chance I can't afford to waste  
I love you since the day, the day we fell apart  
  
I made a bad mistake  
Used to pray for space  
Drowning you one more time  
And mend my wicked ways  
  
'Cause once I ran away  
I love you since the day, the day I broke your heart  
It's more than I could take  
I love you since the day, the day we fell apart  
Now everything is coming under (coming under)  
'Cause you were the chance I can't afford to waste  
I love you since the day, the day we fell apart  
The day we fell apart

And the fellas checkin' everybody out tonight  
And the beach where they all dance - out of sight  
She looks like she won't, but I think she might  
She gotta feel the vibe

I can see the wait there in your eyes  
I can feel the thought in your sigh  
Your knuckles are bruised from a losing flight  
One way down a dead end street  
Broken glass underneath your feet  
You think the day won't break the sunless night  
  
The sun will rise  
The sun will rise  
When you've lost your lights  
The sun will rise  
It'll be alright  
It'll be alright  
  
I've been in stuck in a storm before  
Felt the wind raging at my door  
Couldn't move, couldn't breathe, couldn't find a way out  
Somehow my clouds disappeared  
Somehow I made it here  
Maybe just so you could hear me say  
  
The sun will rise  
The sun will rise (the sun will rise)  
When you've lost your lights  
The sun will rise  
It'll be alright (it'll be alright)  
It'll be alright  
It'll be alright  
It'll be alright  
  
Although you can't see it  
So hard to believe it  
Sometimes you just need a little faith (all you need is a little faith)  
There's an answer to your prayer  
And I swear that there'll come a day, yeah  
  
The sun will rise  
The sun will rise (the sun will rise)  
The sun will rise (the sun will rise)  
The sun will rise  
Yeah  
The sun will rise  
The sun will rise  
  
It'll be alright  
It'll be alright (yeah yeah)  
It'll be alright (yeah yeah)  
It'll be alright (yeah yeah)  
It'll be alright  
  
The sun will rise

Love can be a many splendored thing  
Can't deny the joy it brings  
A dozen roses, diamond rings  
Dreams for sale and fairy tales  
It'll make you hear a symphony  
And you just want the world to see  
But like a drug that makes you blind  
It'll fool ya every time  
  
[Chorus]  
The trouble with love is  
It can tear you up inside  
Make your heart believe a lie  
It's stronger than your pride  
The trouble with love is  
It doesn't care how fast you fall  
And you can't refuse the call  
See you've got no say at all  
  
Now I was once a fool it's true  
I played the game by all the rules  
But now my world's a deeper blue  
I'm sadder but I'm wiser too  
I swore I'd never love again  
I swore my heart would never mend  
Said love wasn't worth the pain  
But then I hear it call my name  
  
The trouble with love is  
It can tear you up inside  
Make your heart believe a lie  
It's stronger than your pride  
The trouble with love is  
It doesn't care how fast you fall  
And you can't refuse the call  
See you've got no say at all  
  
Every time I turn around  
I think I've got it all figured out  
My heart keeps callin'  
And I keep on fallin'  
Over and over again  
The sad story always ends the same  
Me standin' in the pourin' rain  
It seems no matter what I do  
It tears my heart in two  
  
The trouble with love is  
It can tear you up inside  
Make your heart believe a lie  
It's stronger than your pride  
The trouble with love is  
It doesn't care how fast you fall  
And you can't refuse the call  
See you've got no say at all

Ooh  
Don't think I can't feel there's something wrong  
You've been the sweetest part of my life so long  
I look in your eyes, there's a distant light  
And you and I know there'll be a storm tonight  
This is getting serious  
Are you thinking 'bout you or us  
  
(Chorus)  
Don't say what you're about to say  
Look back before you leave my life  
Be sure before you close that door  
Before you roll those dice  
Baby think twice  
  
Baby think twice for the sake of our love, for the memory  
For the fire and the faith that was you and me  
Babe I know it ain't easy when your soul cries out for higher ground  
Cos when you're halfway up, you're always halfway down  
But baby this is serious  
Are you thinking 'bout you or us  
  
(Repeat chorus)  
  
(Breakdown)  
Baby this is serious  
Are you thinking 'bout you or us  
  
Don't say what you're about to say  
Look back before you leave my life  
Be sure before you close that door  
Before you roll those dice  
  
Don't do what you're about to do  
My everything depends on you  
And whatever it takes, I'll sacrifice  
Before you roll those dice  
Baby think twice

I was sittin' with my friend when I saw you walkin' in and my heart started
skippin' a beat  
I was tryna play it cool but I knew it was true that nobody would ever compete  
Well first comes love and then comes  
First date, first kiss, we were checkin' off the list, then you were gettin'
down on one knee  
And you didn't have to guess, it was always a yes, now there's two less fish
in the sea  
  
Let's set the date!  
Let's haul the band!  
Let's cut the cake!  
Tie up the cans!  
I love the ring of your name, your the ying to my yang,  
Oh baby let's give it a shot!  
(Woo!)  
Every wall needs a frame, every ball needs a chain, yeah, I'm talkin' 'bout
tiein' a knot!  
Tie it up!  
  
Somethin' old, somethin' new, somethin' borrowed, somethin' blue,  
And the chairs lined up in the yard.  
The "I do"s and the kisses from a miss to a misses  
Can't wait for forever to stop  
  
Let's set set the date!  
Let's haul the bands!  
Let's cut the cake!  
Tie up the cans!  
I love the ring of your name, your the ying to my yang,  
Oh baby let's give it a shot!  
(Woo!)  
Every wall needs a frame, every ball needs a chain, yeah I'm talkin' bout
tiein' a knot!  
Tie it up!  
  
Tie it up! (Tie it up!)  
Invite the town! (Invite the town!)  
Raise your glass and lock it down!  
Tie it up! (Tie it up!)  
Forever bound! (Forever bound!)  
'Cause I think this will be tonight, yeah!  
  
Well mama's kickin' off her shoes and daddy's spinnin' from the booze, and the
last song is finally sung  
We can run to the moon, can't stop a hunny moon  
Don't it sound like a lot of fun?  
  
Let's set the date!  
Let's haul the band!  
Let's cut the cake!  
Tie up the cans!  
I love the ring of your name, you're the ying to my yang,  
Oh baby let's give it a shot  
Oh!  
Every wall needs a frame, every ball needs a chain, I'm talkin' bout tiein' a
knot  
Tie it up!  
  
Woo!  
Tell you what  
Tie it up!

Baby come close let me tell you this  
In a whisper my heart says you know it too  
Baby we both share a secret wish  
And you're feeling my love reaching out to you  
  
Timeless  
Don't let it end (no)  
Now that you're right here in my arms where you should stay  
Hold tight baby  
Timeless  
Don't let it fade out of sight  
Just let the moments sweep us both away  
Lifting us to where  
We both agree  
This is timeless love  
  
I see it all baby in your eyes  
When you look at me I know I feel it too (yes I do)  
So let's sail away and be forever baby  
Where the crystal ocean melts into the sky  
We shouldn't let the moment pass  
Making me shiver let's make it last  
Why should we lose it don't ever let me go  
  
Timeless  
Baby it's timeless  
Oh baby it's timeless  
  
Timeless  
Don't let it fade out of sight  
Just let the moments sweep us both away  
Lifting us to where  
We both agree  
It's just timeless  
It's just timeless  
  
Love

Never saw 'I love you' as a trend  
'Cause I don't really work like that  
I mean what I say when it leaves my lips, oh  
Nothin' you could say would change my heart  
'Cause I don't really love like that  
If you'd only let me in I'd show ya but I'm tired of workin' so hard  
  
You keep pushin' me away  
Tearin' down your walls is forcing me to break  
Don't know what to say, will you ever let me in?  
It's hard for me to pretend  
So tell me what you wanna do?  
Tell me is there any other way?  
  
'Cause goodbye's on the tip of my tongue  
Tell me there's a reason to stay 'cause I'm about to get up and run  
Better think about the words you say  
If you don't wanna end up alone  
  
Tell me is there any room for me?  
'Cause when it's all said and done babe, I'm tired of singin'  
Goodbye's on the tip of my tongue  
Goodbye's on the tip of my  
  
Never confuse me with where you've been  
'Cause I don't really work like that  
If I'm holdin' you then I'm all in, in  
  
I know you're scared, yeah you've been burned  
But I won't ever hurt you like that  
If you'd take a chance I'm not like them, them, them  
Give and get nothin' in return  
You don't seem to care, you're not the only one who hurts  
Tell me is there any other way  
  
'Cause goodbye's on the tip of my tongue  
Tell me there's a reason to stay 'cause I'm about to get up and run  
Better think about the words you say  
If you don't wanna end up alone  
  
Tell me is there any room for me?  
'Cause when it's all said and done babe, I'm tired of singin'  
Goodbye's on the tip of my tongue  
Goodbye's on the tip of my tongue  
Goodbye's on the tip of my tongue  
Goodbye's on the tip of my  
  
Why you gotta pull away? Pull away and leave me hangin'  
Why you gotta make me say?  
Don't make me say what you've been thinkin' all along  
  
Goodbye's on the tip of my tongue  
I'm about to get up and run  
  
'Cause goodbye's on the tip of my tongue  
Tell me there's a reason to stay 'cause I'm about to get up and run  
Better think about the words you say  
If you don't wanna end up alone  
  
Tell me is there any room for me?  
'Cause when it's all said and done babe, I'm tired of singin'  
Goodbye's on the tip of my tongue  
Goodbye's on the tip of my tongue  
Goodbye's on the tip of my tongue  
Goodbye's on the tip of my

You're here where you should be  
Snow is falling as the carolers sing  
It just wasn't the same  
Alone on Christmas day  
Presents, what a beautiful sight  
Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight  
You're all that I need  
Underneath the tree  
Tonight  
  
I'm gonna hold you close  
Make sure that you know  
I was lost before you  
Christmas was cold and grey  
Another holiday alone to celebrate  
But then one day everything changed  
You're all I need  
Underneath the tree  
  
You're here where you should be  
Snow is falling as the carolers sing  
It just wasn't the same  
Alone on Christmas day  
Presents, what a beautiful sight  
Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight  
You're all that I need  
Underneath the tree  
  
I found, what I was looking for  
A love that's meant for me  
A heart that's mine completely  
Knocked me right off my feet  
And this year I will fall  
With no worries at all  
'Cause you are near and everything's clear  
You're all I need  
Underneath the tree  
  
You're here where you should be  
Snow is falling as the carolers sing  
It just wasn't the same  
Alone on Christmas day  
Presents, what a beautiful sight  
Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight  
You're all that I need  
Underneath the tree  
  
And then one day everything changed  
You're all I need  
Underneath the tree  
  
You're here where you should be  
Snow is falling as the carolers sing  
It just wasn't the same  
Alone on Christmas day  
Presents, what a beautiful sight  
Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight  
You're all that I need  
Underneath the tree  
Tonight

I went up to the mountains  
Because you asked me to  
Up over the clouds  
To were the sky was blue  
I can see all 'round me  
Everywere  
I could see around me  
Everywere  
Sometimes I feel like I'v been nothing but tired  
And i'll be working 'till the day I expire  
So sometimes I just lay down  
Lord what more can I do?  
But then go on again  
Because you asked me to  
Somedays I look down  
Afraid a-afraid I will fall  
And though the sun shines  
I see nothing at all  
But I hear your, your sweet voice  
Oh, oh, ooo  
Coming and goin'  
Coming and goin'  
Lord telling me softly  
You love me so

Vacation all I ever wanted  
Vacation had to get away  
Vacation meant to be spent alone  
  
Vacation all I ever wanted  
Vacation had to get away  
Vacation meant to be spent alone  
... Meant to be spent alone  
  
A week without you, thought I'd forget  
Two weeks without you and I still haven't gotten over you yet  
  
Vacation all I ever wanted  
Vacation had to get away  
Vacation meant to be spent alone  
  
Vacation all I ever wanted  
Vacation had to get away  
Vacation meant to be spent alone  
  
A week without you, thought I'd forget  
Two weeks without you and I still haven't gotten over you yet  
  
Vacation all I ever wanted  
Vacation had to get away  
Vacation meant to be spent alone  
.. Spent alone

You've got your mother and your brother  
Every other undercover  
Tellin' you what to say  
You think I'm stupid  
But the truth is  
That it's cupid, baby  
Lovin' you has made me this way  
So before you point your finger  
Get your hands off of my trigger  
Oh yeah  
You need to know this situation's getting old  
And now the more you talk  
The less I can say, oh  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm looking for attention  
Not another question  
Should you stay or should you go?  
Well, if you don't have the answer  
Why you still standin' here?  
Hey, hey, hey, hey  
Just walk away  
Just walk away  
Just walk away  
  
I waited here for you  
Like a kid waiting after school  
So tell me how come you never showed?  
I gave you everything  
And never asked for anything  
And look at me  
I'm all alone  
So, before you start defendin'  
Baby, stop all your pretendin'  
I know you know I know  
So what's the point in being slow?  
Let's get the show on the road today  
Hey  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I want to love  
I want a fire  
To feel the burn  
My desires  
I want to man by my side  
Not a boy who runs and hides  
Are you gonna fight for me?  
Die for me?  
Live and breathe for me?  
Do you care for me?  
'Cause if you don't, then just leave  
  
I'm looking for attention  
Not another question  
Should you stay or should you go?  
Well, if you don't have the answer  
Why you still standin' here?  
Hey, hey, hey, hey  
Just walk away  
  
If you don't have the answer  
Walk away  
Just walk away  
Then just leave  
Yeah, yeah  
Walk away  
Walk away  
Walk away

Ooh, ooh  
If you see me walking down the street  
And I start to cry each time we meet  
Walk on by  
Boy, walk on by  
  
Make believe that you don't see the tears  
Just let me grieve in private  
Cause each time I see you  
I break down and cry  
Boy, walk on by  
  
I just can't get over losing you  
And so, if I seem broken and blue  
Walk on by  
Boy, walk on by  
  
Foolish pride, all that I can feel  
So let me hide the tears and the sadness  
You gave me when you said goodbye  
Boy, walk on by  
  
Ooh, ooh, make believe that you don't see the tears, honey  
Let me grieve in private  
Cause each time I see you  
I just break down and cry  
Oh oh, just walk on by  
Walk on, walk on  
Ooh, ooh  
Oh, walk on by

Face to face, but miles away  
Building trenches out of empty spaces  
Lay here, next to me  
And close the distance in between  
  
I'll take off yours if you take off mine  
Reveal the things that we're tryna hide  
Take off yours if you take off mine  
Take off mine  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause we could be beautiful with our war paint  
Our war paint  
And we could have it all once we let our walls break  
Our walls break  
Why in the hell do we fight on the front line?  
When we both know that we're here on the same side  
We could be beautiful without the mistake  
Of our war paint  
  
[Verse 2]  
Scar to scar, I wanna know  
Every story that you never told  
Don't shut me out, don't think too much  
Don't keep that barricade up  
  
I'll take off yours if you take off mine  
Reveal the things that we're tryna hide  
Take off yours if you take off mine  
Take off mine  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause we could be beautiful with our war paint  
Our war paint  
And we could have it all once we let our walls break  
Our walls break  
Why in the hell do we fight on the front line?  
When we both know that we're here on the same side  
We could be beautiful without the mistake  
Of our war paint  
  
[Bridge]  
So hold me close and kiss my skin  
Don't be afraid, let me in  
I'll hold you close and take your hand  
To my heart, here I am  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause we could be beautiful with our war paint  
Our war paint  
And we could have it all once we let our walls break  
Our walls break  
Why in the hell do we fight on the front line?  
When we both know that we're here on the same side  
We could be beautiful without the mistake  
Of our war paint  
  
Cause we could be beautiful with our war paint  
Our war paint  
And we could have it all once we let our walls break  
Our walls break  
Why in the hell do we fight on the front line?  
When we both know that we're here on the same side  
We could be beautiful without the mistake  
Of our war paint

Nothing's changed here  
It's like you never left  
I kept everything the same  
Even left your socks at the end of the bed  
  
Everyone keeps telling me  
You're not coming back  
But for my sanity I'm holding on  
It's the only thing I have  
  
I can't let go of your memory baby  
Always in my head, oh  
  
It's the only thing that keeps me going lately  
Since you left  
Oh suddenly I can't remember  
  
What happened here  
Why did you leave  
Are you coming back  
  
What happened here  
Why did you leave  
Are you coming back home  
Are you coming back to me  
  
Can you hear me calling  
Can you still feel my touch  
Wont you find your way back home  
Back to me my love  
  
Still feel your footsteps  
Coming down the hall  
I still feel you next to me when I know you're not there  
I'm so lost  
  
Without you I don't smile  
Without you I don't laugh  
I don't feel at all, no  
  
Without you I don't care  
Without you I'm scared.  
When I'm trying?  
I can't remember  
  
What happened here  
Why did you leave  
Are you coming back  
  
What happened here  
Why did you leave  
Are you coming back home  
Are you coming back to me  
  
I'm tired of crying all night long  
I used to be so strong  
My foolish heart was wrong  
  
I try to hard just not to picture you  
But every day I do  
Lord I do  
Everything reminds me of you  
  
What happened here  
What happened here  
  
I can't let go of your memory baby  
Always in my head, oh  
  
It's the only thing that keeps me going lately  
Since you left  
Oh suddenly I can't remember  
  
What happened here  
Why did you leave  
Are you coming back  
  
What happened here  
Why did you leave  
Are you coming back yeah  
Are you coming back to me  
  
What happened here  
Why did you leave  
Are you coming back

Things that I like about

Blue, I'm getting kinda close to you  
Like a shadow I can't lose  
Hey, you've been hangin' with me every day  
Now you're gettin' in my way  
I know you understand me  
But don't ya think that maybe it's time to move on  
  
[Chorus]  
What's up lonely  
Seems you're my only  
Friend who wants to share my pain  
Tell me heartache  
What's it gonna take  
For you to leave me alone today  
Just when I think that you're gone  
You're in the mirror lookin' back at me  
So what's up lonely  
  
Sometimes, I wish you weren't by my side  
Can't you find another shoulder, cause I  
I want to leave this broken heart behind  
We been wastin' too much time  
Find someone else to rain on  
I'm really getting' tired of singin' this sad song  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Don't want to give you a reason  
To hang around anymore  
You won't be hurting my feelings  
If you find another broken heart you can lean on

I don't believe in the smile that you leave  
When you walk away and say goodbye  
Well, I don't expect the world to move underneath me  
But for God's sake, could you try  
I know that you're true to me  
You're always there, you say you care  
I know that you want to be mine  
  
[Chorus]  
Where is your heart, cause I don't really feel you  
Where is your heart, what I really want is to believe you  
Is it so hard to give me what I need  
I want your heart to bleed, that's all I'm asking for, oh  
Where is your heart  
  
I don't understand, your love is so cold  
It's always me who's reaching out for your hand  
And I've always dreamed that love would be effortless  
Like a petal falling to the ground  
A dreamer following his dream  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It seems so much is left unsaid  
But you can say anything  
Oh, anytime you need  
Baby, it's just you and me, oh yeah  
  
I know that you're true to me  
You're always there, you say you care  
I know that you want to be mine  
  
Where is your heart, cause I don't really feel you  
Where is your heart, what I really want is to believe you  
Is it so hard to give me what I need  
I want your heart to bleed, that's all I'm asking for, yeah  
  
Where is your heart, cause I don't really feel you  
Where is your heart, what I really want is to believe you  
Is it so hard to give me what I need  
I want your heart to bleed, and that's all I'm asking for  
Where is your heart [Repeat: x4]

[Kelly]  
There are times I swear I know  
Your near. But then again your  
Heart can play so many tricks on  
You but I still wish that I could  
Be  
  
[Chours: Both]  
Where you are  
Where we had danced toghether  
Where you are  
Will be kissing under the stars  
Tonight only than will I be where  
You are.  
  
[Kalan]  
And I can see your face but  
It hurts everytime I do cause you  
My love ....  
  
[Chours: Both]  
Where you are  
Where we had danced toghether  
Where you are  
Will be kissing under the stars  
Tonight only than will I be where  
You are.

I am a woman  
Cut in two  
By ambitious pride  
Stuck in my ways  
Between you and my other life  
  
Now I have been around enough to know when love has ended  
And I believe that you and I deserve to be extended  
  
Why don't you try  
To make me stay  
When it's time to go  
Why don't you try  
To stand in my way  
Because we both know  
I can't stop myself  
  
Our empty house  
You occupy  
When I'm far away  
Heavier hearts won't justify why I'm gone today  
  
Now I have hung a cloud above our house from always leaving  
I figured you would at least make me give a better reason  
  
Why don't you try  
To make me stay  
When it's time to go  
Why don't you try  
To stand in my way  
Because we both know  
I can't stop myself  
  
In the early mornings when I'm up before dawn  
Say "why don't you stay" but you keep sleeping on  
Maybe you're just too used to me being gone  
'Cause if you know that I go when I go  
  
Then why don't you try  
To make me stay  
When it's time to go  
Why don't you try  
To stand in my way  
Because we both know  
I can't stop myself.

This situation  
If it gets any deeper could be critical  
I'm not your love monkey  
So be taking back all the lies you sold  
What did you want me to be  
It's just too much now  
So tell me, so tell me, so tell me one two three four  
  
So what's your evil attitude  
When you got me spending my time pleasing you  
Why must you keep me underground  
Tell me, tell me why you wanna bring me down?  
Is it too much to give a damn  
When I'm giving you one hundred and ten  
Don't blink cause I won't be around  
Tell me, so tell me, why you wanna bring me down  
  
Now your transmission is on the negative  
You're on a losing streak  
This information is getting ordinary  
And you're losing me  
What's with your hostility  
Ouhh when the lie's on me?  
Well you're down to the last chance  
So tell me, so tell me uno dos tres cuatro  
  
So what's your evil attitude  
When you got me spending my time pleasing you  
Why must you keep me underground  
Tell me, tell me why you wanna bring me down?  
Is it too much to give a damn  
When I'm giving you one hundred and ten  
Don't blink cause I won't be around  
Tell me, so tell me why you wanna bring me down  
  
(Bring me down, bring me down)  
  
Was it all just a waste of time  
I don't wanna spend my whole life thinking bout it  
Baby this is where I draw the line, I think I'm done  
  
Guitar  
  
So what's your evil attitude  
When you got me spending my time pleasing you  
Why must you keep me underground  
Tell me, tell me why you wanna bring me down?  
Is it too much to give a damn  
When I'm giving you one hundred and ten  
Don't blink cause I won't be around  
Tell me, so tell me why you wanna bring me down  
  
Down yeah  
Why you wanna bring me down  
Oh yeah  
Tell me, tell me why you wanna bring me down?  
Down, down, down  
Why you wanna bring me down  
Why you wanna, Why you wanna,  
Why you wanna bring me down?

No I can't forget this evening  
Nor your face as you were leaving  
But I guess that's just the way the story goes  
You always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows  
Yes it shows  
I can't live  
If living is without you  
I can't live  
I can't give anymore  
I can't live  
If living is without you  
Can't live  
Can't give anymore  
Well I can't forget this evening  
Nor your face as you were leaving  
But I guess that's just the way the story goes  
You always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows  
Yeah, yes it shows  
Can't live  
If living is without you  
Can't live  
I can't give anymore  
Can't live (No, can't live)  
If living is without you (No, I can't live)  
Oh, I can't live  
Can't give anymore, Oh...  
(No, can't live)  
(No I can't live)  
No, oh yeah, no no no no no,  
I can't live

Everybody's happy  
Snow is falling down  
Prayers are being nicer  
Miracles all around  
  
From afar I've loved you  
But never let it show  
And every year another  
December comes and goes  
Always watching  
Never reaching  
But this Christmas  
I'm gonna risk it all  
This Christmas  
I'm not afraid to fall  
  
So magical and nothing more  
Than words I never said  
You know it's love, you see me like  
You never seen me yeah  
Wrapped in red (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)  
  
Blue is where I've been  
Green can't run to you  
Silver does remind me  
That mistletoe's for two  
  
So I found a color  
That only tells the truth  
That paints a picture  
Of how I feel for you  
  
This Christmas  
I'm gonna risk it all  
This Christmas  
I'm not afraid to fall  
  
So magical and nothing more  
Than words I never said  
You know it's love, you see me like  
You never seen me yeah  
Wrapped in red (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)  
  
I'll never feel you  
If I don't tell you  
  
This Christmas  
I'm gonna risk it all  
This Christmas  
I'm not afraid to fall  
  
So magical and nothing more  
Than words I never said  
You know it's love, you see me like  
You never seen me yeah  
Wrapped in red (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)  
Wrapped in red (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

Lay back, enjoy the fall lover I won't hurt you  
I take it all on if you trust me  
Don't hesitate let it go, let me know, baby show me  
I don't read minds but I'm trying my best to read yours  
  
[Chorus:]  
Yeah  
Let me know, let me know  
Yeah  
Let me know, it's all for you  
  
Help me help yourself  
I want to give it all to you but  
Don't make me second guess, I don't want to play games no more  
For sure I've got your back, I've never wanted anything more than you and your
sexy smile  
I love you so try not to blow it this time  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Everything inside you, about you  
I want to know, taste, hold, love you anytime I want to  
Let me show you, let me give you everything I have saved just for you  
I know you love me but I'm gonna need more than what you're giving me  
I want to feel you but I feel empty  
You gotta help me, you gotta meet me halfway  
There I see you, can you see me, closer now  
Just tell me, show me, what it's gonna take to get you to trust me, love me
like I know you can  
  
[Chorus]

If you go, they'll say you're following  
If you don't, then you're too good for them  
If you smile, you must be ignorant  
If you don't, what's your problem  
If you're down, so ungrateful  
And if you're happy, why so selfish?  
You can't win no, you can't win no  
  
[Chorus]  
The one who doesn't quite fit in  
Under dressed under your skin  
Oh a walking disaster  
Every time you try to fly you end up fallin'  
Out of line  
Oh you can't, you can't win no  
  
If you're thin, call it a walkin' disease  
If you're not, they're all screamin' obese  
If you're straight, why aren't you married yet?  
If you're gay, why aren't you waving a flag?  
If it's wrong, you'll never hit  
If it's right, you'll always miss  
You can't win, no you can't win no  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And you try you try so hard  
But I swear it on your heart  
And you play you play the game  
But you pay you pay for it  
You can't win no, you can't win no  
  
If you speak, you'll only piss them off  
If you don't, you're another robot  
If you stop, they'll just say you quit  
If you don't, you might lose your shh  
You can't win no, you can't win no  
You can't win no  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I can't win  
  
[Chorus]

Thick skin, soft touch,  
Heart of gold but it's na-na-na-not enough,  
Forgiving arms, the higher road,  
Working hard but it's na-na-na-not enough,  
You say, I'm not good enough, I'm not good enough  
But what you really mean is, you're not good enough, you're not good enough  
You can't deliver  
So you turn it around  
  
[Chorus]  
You didn't let me down,  
You didn't tear me apart  
You just opened my eyes,  
While breaking my heart  
You didn't do it for me  
I'm not as dumb as you think, you just made me cry  
While claiming that you love me  
You love me, you love me  
You said you loved me but that I  
I'm not good enough, I'm not good enough  
  
Stronghold, but fun ride,  
But roller coasters aren't just na-na-na-not enough,  
I keep it in, you wear me out,  
This kind of love is na-na-na-not enough,  
Said I'm just a sinking ship, I'm just a sinking ship,  
But what that really means, is you can't handle this, you can't handle this,  
You couldn't win so you turn it around  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Your love feels different it's like a blow to the head with your compliments.  
Your love hurts deeper  
It's like a brick in the sea and I'm drowning with it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So understand it means nothing when you say you love me  
When you say you love me  
When you say you love me  
You love me, you love me  
  
You didn't let me down,  
You didn't tear me apart  
You just opened my eyes,  
While breaking my heart  
You didn't do it for me  
I'm not as dumb as you think, you just made me cry  
While claiming that you love me  
You love me, you love me  
You know the truth is that  
You're not good enough, you're not good enough

When you hit the bottom  
When you're left with nothing  
When you can't tell the difference, yeah  
You still won't know what it's like  
  
When you think you're? Damaged?  
When it's overwhelming  
When you can't get past it, yeah  
You still won't know what it's like  
What it's like  
  
You haven't seen the ghosts that I've seen  
You haven't lived enough to know what it means  
To feel the? Pain? In love turned cold  
To taste the end before it's over  
  
When your heart is broken  
And you can trust no one  
When you think you're lonely, yeah  
You still won't know what it's like  
  
When you feel like nothing  
You just can't take it  
When your heart is breaking  
You still won't know what it's like  
What it's like  
  
You haven't seen the ghosts that I've seen  
You haven't lived enough to know what it means  
To feel the? Pain? In love turned cold  
To taste the end before it's over  
  
You don't know the person suffering  
So before you start? Can't make any of this out? Sympathies  
Take a look at what's left of me  
Take a look at what's left of me, left of me  
  
Every day I fight a war with God  
? And every time I think you've figured it out?  
? No it's not?  
  
You haven't seen the ghosts that I've seen  
You haven't lived enough to know what it means  
To feel the? Pain? In love turned cold  
To taste the end before it's over  
  
You don't know the person suffering  
So before you start? Can't make any of this out? Sympathy?  
Take a look at what's left of me  
Take a look at what's left of me, left of me  
  
You don't know the person suffering  
So before you start? Can't make any of this out? Sympathy?  
Take a look at what's left of me  
Take a look at what's left of me, left of me

I see how you're tryin' to weasel  
Your way in and boy I know how  
You maneuver with your  
Your confusion  
  
You tell me that I'm your only  
And how bad that you want me  
Then why are you so shady  
If I'm supposed to be your lady  
  
Why should I believe anything you say  
And how could you shame me that way  
Tell me where, where'd you get the nerve  
To even think I'd do you could play me for  
  
[Chorus]  
You thought we didn't know  
You thought we were in the dark  
But boy your cover's blown  
'Cause we both know now, oh no  
You thought you had us both  
At your beckon call  
But now who's the joke  
And look who's laughing now  
  
Now you're trying to use us  
Against one another but it won't work  
I see right through your game boy  
And I know exactly where the blame falls  
  
You, you try to deny all your actions  
For once in your life be a real man  
At least give me the proper respect of the truth  
I already know you did it  
  
Why should I believe anything you say  
And how could you treat me that way  
Where'd you get the nerve to even think that you  
You could play me boy  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now I see right through you baby  
You try to tell me you want me  
Can't you just get it through your thick head  
'Cause I have seen this game before and  
Now I'm showing you the door so  
Shut your mouth I'm night tryin' to hear your lies again  
  
Sorry you couldn't be a better man  
  
[Chorus]

You're all I need to get by  
  
Like the sweet morning dew  
I took one look at you  
And it was plain to see  
You were my destiny  
  
With my arms open wide  
I threw away my pride  
I'll sacrifice for you  
Dedicate my life for you  
  
I will go where you lead  
Always there in time of need  
And when I lose my will  
You'll be there to push me up the hill  
  
There's no no looking back for us  
We got love sure 'nough, it's enough  
You're all  
You're all I want to strive for and do a little more  
You're all all the joys under the sun wrapped up into one  
  
You're all  
You're all I need  
You're all I need  
Oh yeah yeah  
You're all I need to get by  
  
Oh you are  
Oh you are  
  
Oh yah yah yah  
Oooh oooh oooh oooh  
Aww Yah
