Sonny signed his name up for tomorrow and laughed with all his friends  
At all the little men who borrows tunes they heard just yesterday  
Davey got us down but we got away and drank to all the days  
That we had whiled away just playing Robin Hood a little out of phase  
  
And then the nightmares come and you get blown away  
And up in your room, your walls are cold  
You find your head is holding out for the welcome of a better day  
  
And then the nightmares come and you get blown away  
And up in your room, your walls are getting colder  
Like you're getting on a roller coaster, you can't find the breaks  
  
Stevie burned the sky when he flew away and left us things to say  
When all the world was falling down around our shoulders, cold and gray  
Harry carried on in his usual way and Minnie went inside  
And came out once and we both cried and Minnie blew my head away  
  
When you're giving everything away, everybody lets you pay  
You're saving up for a better day, seeing things in a better way  
When you know you've got to live, there's nothing you won't give  
To hear the phone and not let it ring every Monday morning  
  
Shughie found love and he almost cried, we laughed and wondered why  
We love the sky and found the space and gazed out over Stevie's plane

Up through all the streets you go  
But little girl don't find her name  
And we're all gone down roads to homes  
Where everybody finds their game  
  
Just behind the street she goes  
Where she'll be found behind her wheel  
'Cause it's the only place she knows  
That makes her know just how she feels  
  
'Cause you're the biggest thing  
That I see  
You've got me where you want me  
You hunt me down, you haunt me  
And beg me to believe  
  
All too fast to where she goes  
But who'll be first to find her name  
And holding on in Hollywood  
But holding on don't make the grade  
  
Just about when it's all right  
There's you and I : we'll find our way  
But it's holidays not Hollywood  
And holidays don't suit my game.  
  
'Cause you're the biggest thing  
That I see  
You've got me where you want me  
You hunt me down and haunt me  
And beg me to believe  
  
Hollow days and hollow nights  
But everyone they find their way  
It hightlights you when things ain't right  
And makes you want to find your place  
  
'Cause you're the biggest thing  
That I see  
You've got me where you want me  
You hunt me down, you haunt me  
And beg me to believe  
  
'Cause you're the biggest thing  
That I see  
You've got me where you want me  
You hunt me down,you haunt me  
And beg me to believe

Charlie brown says  
No-one promised this when i was a kid  
When my days were filled with carousels  
Fairground rides and cockleshells  
Kicking pebbles on a beach  
When time couldn't reach me  
And tears were just a memory left to be learned  
  
Now days catch me without an overcoat  
Five o'clock shoes full of snow  
All rained out, nowhere to go  
  
Memories are sure to find you  
No matter how fast you run  
Gonna catch up with you  
  
Charlie brown says  
Oh this winter sure sure gets me down  
When there ain't no friends around

I went down to Chelsea Walk  
Where the sun doesn't shine at all  
And I went looking for something for me  
But I came back with nothing at all  
Except an old man who could not see  
But he said that he knew God  
In Chelsea Walk  
On Chelsea Walk  
  
Now I've been down to Chelsea Walk  
Where the sun just refuses to shine  
And I ran back to my little room  
And I jumped straight into a bottle of wine  
You know I'll be alright for just a day  
But tomorrow I must wake  
In Chelsea Walk  
On Chelsea Walk  
  
Old man I must be on my way  
Don't you worry I'm just scared for those who pray  
In Chelsea Walk  
On Chelsea Walk

Cool cool water where I rest my head  
You keep me running to a single bed  
Yellow moon rising on the riverboat wild  
You keep me running like a child  
  
Yellow moon rising on the riverboat wild  
You keep me running like a child  
  
Bobby don't know  
He's got a funny way of seeing situations  
Call him on the phone  
And ain't it funny but he never seems to come home  
  
Bobby don't know  
He's got a funny way of seeing situations  
Call him on the phone  
Ain't it strange that he never seems to go home  
  
Cool cool water where I rest my head  
You keep me running to a single bed  
Yellow moon rising on the riverboat wild  
You keep me running like a child

Well, I got a problem  
And it just won't wait  
I've been getting on one  
With the man who guards your gate  
When he says you're sleeping  
In your hideaway  
It is what he's keeping back  
That gives your game away  
Come quit your crazy lowdown ways  
You're walking astray  
Come quit your weary worn out ways  
You're walking astray  
And I'd like to say that I like this  
More than I do today  
Yes, I got a problem  
Like you've never seen  
I've been getting bothered  
By the man who locks your screen  
When he says you're hiding  
And in your room you'll stay  
It is what he's holding back  
That says what he can't say  
Come quit your crazy lowdown ways  
You're walking astray  
Come quit your weary worn out ways  
You're walking astray  
And I'd like to say that I like this  
More than I do today  
I'm just a lazy man  
Who has to hear the truth  
And I hear what's true from you  
Come quit your crazy lowdown ways  
You're walking astray  
Come quit your weary worn out ways  
You're walking astray  
And I'd like to say that I like this  
More than I do today  

Lay down your head  
And look to your window  
Where do you go  
When it's not where you're going?  
And how do you see  
When the light isn't shining?  
Where you could be  
If you worked out the timing  
  
And how does it feel when the world comes on so real and true?  
And how do you do the things you do to you?  
  
If I were a king  
And you were a lady  
What would I sing  
To say what I'm saying?  
And would you believe  
The verses left open?  
The heart on my sleeve  
The rhyming all broken  
  
And how does it feel when the world comes on so real and true?  
And how do you do the things you do to you?  
  
Sell me a river  
And I'll skate away  
To the downstream  
Where I did play  
So easy minded  
Like a hill on the skyline  
Tripped up and blinded  
Getting lost on the sidelines  
  
And how does it feel when the world comes on so real and true?  
And how do you do the things you do to you?  
And how do you do the things you do to you?

You drive the away the best of you  
It's all that's left to say  
You leave me with the rest of you  
You've made it on your way  
I need a call to save from you  
Just before you go  
The more that I've been close with you  
The door was always closed  
-Chorus-  
Drive away, there's nothing you should say  
Drive away, but drive us anyway  
Get on up and straight you go  
There's nothing left to say  
And begging not's my place you know  
You'll never hear it anyway  
There's all the days I let you stay  
I saw it made you blind  
There's more than I can really say  
Why it is it traps you all inside  
  
[-Chorus-]  
You made it all get so uptight  
I made it in the dreams  
You went and robbed an overnight  
And they hid behind your scream  
They've hidden where I just don't know  
I think you've gone inside  
I hope the world looks good from there  
But I hope it looks alright  
We never made it all the way  
We never made it all the way  
You take the best of you  
I'll keep the rest of you  
  
[-Chorus-]

Mother and Stan don't blame yourself for Rose  
She was out there playing in the road  
Better to let her know not to forget  
All that schooling goes right through their heads  
  
They take back all  
And when you give them loving  
Fall you to your knees  
Then give back nothing  
But looking through love  
You know there's something... so real  
  
Father and Son you're in this one so deep  
I could always lull myself to sleep  
But I will cry to let you always know  
All my life I need your time to grow

Renegades and shifting shades  
And the light's in your face  
And you friend's talk lying  
But some of them got flowers in their room  
  
When it's on and you're falling on every floor  
That you're hoping to score  
And you're every night ? ? ?  
But some of them got flowers in their room  
  
But some of them got flowers in their room  
But some of them got flowers in their room  
  
Hear the word that the man on the stairs  
Knows your every affair and is holding your hand  
And he says some of them got flowers in their room  
And he screams in a face  
But the smile on the face is cool and it's cold  
And it reads vacated  
And some of them got flowers in their room  
  
And some of them got flowers in their room  
And some of them got flowers in their room  
  
And I take someone home and I can't be alone  
And there's faces to please and I walk on the knees  
Oh you see, I got no flowers in my room  
  
And I laugh with my mouth and I laugh with you  
But the joke was a joke that I never really knew  
Some of them got flowers in their room  
  
Some of them got flowers in their room  
Some of them got flowers in their room

I think everybody's after me  
They want to know just what I feel  
Pushing wires under my nose  
Everybody's standing on my toes  
Telling the world what I should know  
  
You said you'd seen life from near the floor  
You opened every closing door  
  
Thank you for always being there  
All the nights in which we shared  
And we know we're always there  
  
If it ever gets you down  
You know I'll always be around  
Coz too much just ain't enough  
  
We, we who are your property  
Whose every single move you see  
We don't mind your prying eyes  
We don't mind all your lies  
Or the headlines that you write

Well I used to be a listener - there was nothing left to get  
About what you are and what you haven't been yet  
and some of them like to tell a story that is long and old  
and couch it in indifference and the wine  
that they were sold to get away  
  
Well someone's got to tell them that its not deserved,  
rehearsed or written down by playwrights over time  
just picking up on a nerve.  
And some of them got a difference that they reserve for you  
Well I like them all but I don't trust any of them  
well shouldn't you, just get away  
  
Well I used to think my freedom was a lot of things I'd give,  
demanding on my time but I had so much time to give,  
and I used to think that everything was a knee in what you are.  
But finding out the truth that hurts  
so I never went that far  
I always get away  
  
Well it comes down to the fact that I'm now different from the past,  
demanding all my ideals its just trying to make them last,  
and some of the things that you say they're ringing home so true,  
I hang my head out of the door and I follow you,  
yes I follow you and get away

And when she blows the candle flame to smoke  
She says a prayer for all of those who live in houses and in homes  
And Monday she'll go down town standing naked in the road  
You may know what I am  
But who I am you don't know  
  
She'll run across the mustard dust sand  
Scream down the wind  
And the sea is in a cold  
Like when in holiday homes  
And houses like sweet confectionery  
And sandcastles and drinking wine  
Hungry dinners perfectly timed  
  
And mother and father glowing young  
Happy to be each other together  
When she blows the candle out  
She goes to bed and lies and drags through her head  
The day that went way of every day  
But tomorrow she'll fly a plane  
Over the fields where the houses aren't built yet  
  
She smiled sweetly across the room  
Through the lunch time smoke  
And I loved her for a second  
And discarded the queen and I know  
How sweetness turns sour  
And leaves they turn to brown  
And then to earth and dust  
And settle in this town  
You get blown away...  
  
(repeat 1st half)  
She smiled sweetly across the lunch time smoke  
And I loved her for a second and discarded the queen and I know  
When men are being little boys again  
And women cruel step mothers of old  
And this is the invention  
The adventure of my own  
I get blown away...

She never has to stop and think  
Never makes you lose a thing  
She is so enchanting  
I always have to stop a while  
Cross my hands and close my eyes  
I am so demanding  
When she smiles, she opens wide  
Touching you inside to lie  
Life can be so shaking handed  
Nervously you're shaking signs  
Life is better taken blind  
Still you're left so disenchanted  
Giving it all away  
Giving it all away  
You always have to stop and think  
Desperately to find something  
That is even handed  
I never want to think a thing  
That shatters almost everything  
Life can leave you hanging  
When she smiles, she opens wide  
Touching you inside to lie  
Life can be so shaking handed  
Nervously you're shaking signs  
Life is better taken blind  
Still you're left so disenchanted  
Giving it all away  
Giving it all away  
Today, new day  
I'm so tired of flown day  
I've got no one to say  
What is wrong is that you can't say  
When she smiles, she opens wide  
Touching you inside to lie  
Life can be so shaking handed  
Nervously you're shaking signs  
Life is better taken blind  
Still you're left so disenchanted  
Giving it all away  
Giving it all away  
Giving it all away  
Giving it all away  

I don't ever wanna go out like a light  
  
Have you got the right  
To lay your burden on me?  
Have you got the right  
To lay your burden on me?  
  
Is it ever right  
Make it all out when it will never be?  
  
But it?s different, so different  
So different from before  
And it gets no easier  
  
Do you have the right  
To come on over so strong?  
Does it make it right  
When it makes it all so very wrong?  
  
But it?s different from before  
This is different from before  
This is different from before

Hello Monday my old friend  
I come with you to talk again  
And then again I'm still waiting  
There's no point in hanging on  
Watching the sun go down  
Spinning round and round  
  
Ah, Monday morning  
I don't know if you are coming  
Ah, Monday morning  
I don't know if you are coming  
  
Hello Monday my old friend  
I come with you to talk again  
And then again I'm still waiting  
What's point in hanging on  
Watching the sun go down  
Spinning round and round and round and round  
  
Ah, Monday morning  
I don't know if you are coming  
Ah, Monday morning  
I don't know if you are coming for me  
Oh for me, for me,  
Ah, Monday morning  
I don't know  
  
What's the point in hanging on  
After the sun is gone  
I'm hanging on and on and on and on  
  
Ah, Monday morning  
I don't know if you are coming  
Ah, Monday morning  
I don't know if you are coming

I feel a love that's so hard to bear  
Won't you come kiss me and take this despair  
Let the morning time dapple its light in your hair  
Like warm running water in snow  
  
But I feel a love of jealousy and pain  
Lost in the race 'tween the foolish and vain  
Come in the morning time whistle to take you away  
Where the sun always burns in the Winter  
  
Oh...Here in my Heart  
Oh...Here in my Heart  
  
And I know that all I'm saying is wrong  
Etched in the night - time and rhymed in a song  
Come tomorrow I'll lighten-up and drink to the ones  
Who love without asking for loving  
  
Don't forsake me  
The morning time plays at the children's door  
If you leave me  
Then what would I tell them you're leaving for?  
  
I feel a love that's so hard to bear  
Won't you come kiss me and take this despair  
Let the morning time dapple its light in your hair  
Like warm running water in snow

Don't let my feet get off the ground  
Today I'm glad to be standing here  
But all the time I spent tunnelling down  
To some place where I'm not so clear  
  
I've been holding out for this time  
Standing straight in my own line  
Was hoping you're making it too  
  
All the hours we were learning to fly  
We're chasing night-lights round the room  
I can never repay when I learnt from you  
I know you're seeing it your own way too  
  
Your head just went for another walk  
But it's coming home and it hangs in the hall  
Your head in your hand as you're suffering  
But you I know what state you're in  
  
Fall on my knees and my hair rolls around  
But even on my knees I know I can stand  
If it's coming home it's coming for you  
I can see me standing with dunston and you  
  
I've been holding out for my neighbour  
Standing straight for my brother  
Was hoping you're making it too

Shirley was a lady whose teeth were made of gold  
She danced before the music and everything it told  
  
Huckleberry Grove  
Where the music plays into tomorrow night  
Huckleberry Grove  
Only fools would need to argue or to fight  
  
Shirley had eight children and each of them were told  
You got joy for singing burning in your soul  
  
Huckleberry Grove  
Where the idiots can't ease you of your mind  
Huckleberry Grove  
Take a free train, leave your luggage far behind  
  
Oh she sings shangri-la  
Oh she sings shangri-la  
  
Shirley was a lady who mostly stayed at home  
But she went out dancing down Huckleberry Grove  
  
Huckleberry Grove  
Where the music plays into tomorrow night  
Huckleberry Grove  
You'll be groovin' on the best days of your life  
Huckleberry Grove  
Where the music's guaranteed to blow your mind  
Huckleberry Grove  
Leave your luggage, get a free train, get behind  
  
Oh she sings shangri-la  
Oh she sings shangri-la

I am the news and I'll say no more  
I am the stranger at your door  
I am the the deep beneath the sea  
The threat of flood tide rising  
I am the banks bearing refugees  
Always a cause not solution  
A constant fear or a fleeting joy  
Your only friend who needs using  
  
I am the news and I'm in your face  
And I'll take my profit from your faith  
I am the the face beneath the face  
The catalyst of explosions  
I am the crop bearing crippled genes  
I am an inside connection  
A constant friend on a changing screen  
Your history and direction  
  
Radio, radio  
I'll turn you on again  
You're the truth  
You're a soothe  
Be the blues  
Be my best friend  
Don't give us the truth  
I need the news again  
  
I am the news and I'm every spin  
I am what is and what's not in  
I am the trump card, I'm the ace  
I am the news and I'm in your face  
I am the ocean's biggest roar  
I am the smallest twist of fate  
I am the ending of a play  
I am the opening curtain  
  
I am the crop bearing crippled genes  
I am an inside connection  
A constant friend on a changing screen  
Your history and direction

When the night-time creeps on in  
I will be there, I will be there  
Come on and let me in  
I will be there, I will be there  
  
Don't ever be afraid when I say  
I love you, I love you  
And I'll take the time to say I love you  
  
Come on, don't shoulder hurt  
Take it on back, don't make it worse  
Come the night and I will call  
I'll take it back, you'll take it all  
  
Don't ever be afraid when I say  
I love you, I love you  
And I'll take the time to say I love you  
  
Don't be so scared about it  
And I just can't be without saying  
I love you, I love you  
And I'll take the time to say I love you  
  
I love you, I love you  
And I'll take the time to say I love you  
I love you

I'm not one to judge that much  
And anyway I just wanna get high on you  
But thirteen year old girls in hotels on the other side of the world  
Seems a little much for me  
  
Yeah, I wanna stay alive with you  
  
But they look you in the eye  
And anyway they'll always slip a smile at you  
But thirteen year old girls in rat-holes on the other side of the world  
They're gonna lie to you  
  
Yeah, I wanna stay alive with you  
  
Free-runs in a town where the boys and girls are settling down for the night  
To make up and make eyes at you  
  
Yeah, I wanna stay alive with you

I'm so tired of workin' everyday  
Now the weekend's come, I'm gonna throw my troubles away  
If you've got the cab fare, Mister, you'll do alright  
I want to see the bright lights tonight  
  
Meet me at the station don't be late  
I need to spend some money and it just won't wait  
Take me to the dance and hold me tight  
I want to see the bright lights tonight  
  
There's crazy people runnin' all over town  
There's a silver band just marchin' up and down  
And the big boys are all spoilin' for a fight  
I want to see the bright lights tonight  
  
Meet me at the station don't be late  
I need to spend some money and it just won't wait  
Take me to the dance and hold me tight  
I want to see the bright lights tonight  
  
A couple of drunken nights rollin' on the floor  
Is just the kind of mess I'm looking for  
I'm gonna dream till Monday comes in sight  
I want to see the bright lights tonight  
  
Meet me at the station don't be late  
I need to spend some money and it just won't wait  
Take me to the dance and hold me tight  
I want to see the bright lights tonight  
  
Take me to the dance and hold me tight  
I want to see the bright lights tonight

I'm going away to see my own  
And tread my earth  
I've got no ordinary gain  
By to set my worth  
I get enough and I get too late  
And if I fall down on the road  
Then I won't get grazed  
  
I cannot let you take my time  
Or till my earth  
You've had enough of life to see  
That it shakes my nerve  
All of these things I can't get straight  
And if I'm falling to the road  
Then I won't get grazed  
  
I've had two of them or three  
And I just get hurt  
I watch me crawling down the road  
Trying to guess my worth  
I know not what I'm trying to say  
But if I'm falling on this road  
Then I won't get grazed  
  
I watch you running down the road  
So I get mine worked out  
But you watch me falling on the run  
And you have me called out  
All of these things they get so strange  
Just kill me falling on the road  
But I won't get grazed (x4)

She is home  
Tellin' she's the one  
Who makes you well  
She makes you feel okay  
  
She is home  
Tellin' she's the one  
Who makes you go  
And sends you on your way  
  
But she's getting something  
You start to feel  
She blows the faster deal [?]  
  
She is there  
Making up the face  
To hide the scar  
You won't lurk beneath it  
  
She is there  
She's got more than anyone  
And so I've always thought she must deserve it  
  
And if you get your way  
I may blow the faster deal [?]  
  
Everyone  
Hope's say I the one(?? ?)  
I wish you well  
I hope you feel okay  
(repeat)  
  
And if you get your way  
Feel the way you're feeling  
(x3)

I'm in my field  
I'm in my stream  
And I'm love  
I'm in my tree  
  
I take a walk  
Nine hundred miles  
I cross the stile  
I'm in my field  
  
And I'm in love  
And it's for free  
I'm in my field  
I'm in my field  
  
I'm in my field  
I'm in my stream  
And I will yield  
I'm in my field  
  
And I'm in love  
Across the stile  
Come in my field  
Just you and me  
  
We'll take a walk  
Nine hundred miles  
And I'm in love  
We'll count the stars  
  
I'm in my field  
I'm in my stream  
Well I'm in love  
Just you and me  
  
I'm in my field  
I'm in my stream  
Well I'm in love  
I'm in my tree  
  
I take a walk  
Nine hundred miles  
I cross the stile  
I'm in my field

Sonny went and flipped away and said he had to go  
How could you ever say he never stayed alone  
And how could I belong with anyone you know  
Come on every line's a line I'll never know  
  
Oh, it's a beautiful thing  
Oh, it's a terrible thing  
  
Sometimes I can get along alone enough  
Backing everyone away and never have enough  
And how could I be playing every line for you  
Look at the things today that I can never choose  
  
Oh, it's a beautiful thing  
Oh, it's a terrible thing  
  
Sometimes I could never ever ever fade again  
Sometimes I could never ever ever fade again  
Sometimes I could never ever ever fade again  
  
And how could I be playing every line for you  
Look at the things today that I never choose  
  
Oh, it's a beautiful thing  
Oh, it's a terrible thing

Who is that upon the stairs  
Acting like he don't know where  
And who is laying down all the cards  
And giving me the wrong things to say  
And like a wheel on the table  
  
He's a Cain to my Abel:  
Oh, it's my shadow  
A confessor to my dreams casting ribbons round my feet  
Oh, into my day  
  
It's my shadow  
Making eyes until the sun lights the daytime as she comes  
Oh, into my day  
  
Happy in the time when I would have been there to see you  
Happy in the time when I would have been there at all  
Happy when the night is gone and I believe you  
Happy when the night is gone and I need a call  
  
Who is chasing in the wind all the letters never sent  
And who is dusting down the stars and giving me the wrong moves to make  
And like a wheel on the table, he's a Cain to my Abel  
Dancing upon the floor, its my shadow  
Making eyes until the sun blinds the daytime as she comes  
Oh, into my day  
  
It's my shadow  
Like a willow to my stream casting heaven round my feet  
Oh, into my day  
  
When you find that things are getting wild is that  
The hardest smile that you can ever feel  
When you find that things are getting wild is that  
The hardest smile that you can ever feel  
Paralyzed until the sun lights the daytime as she comes  
And if my shadow comes a creeping  
Then I'll always find me sleeping in the sun  
  
When you find that things are getting wild is that  
The hardest smile that you can ever feel  
When you find that things are getting wild is that  
The hardest smile that you can ever feel  
When you find that things are getting wild is that  
The hardest smile that you can ever feel  
When you find that things are getting wild is that  
The hardest smile that you can ever feel  
When you find that things are getting wild is that  
The hardest smile that you can ever feel  
When you find that things are getting wild is that  
The hardest smile that you can ever feel  
When you find that things are getting wild is that  
The hardest smile that you can ever feel

It's warm outside  
But I can hear the snow  
Falling on my window  
I had to go away  
To somewhere deeper down  
I know it's my mistake  
To take off out of this town  
And June becomes July  
  
This road's on fire  
And my train's running slow  
It rains against my window  
I had to get away  
To somewhere no-one knows  
I know it's my mistake  
To take off now in this way  
And June becomes July  
  
The air is thin  
When you're above the clouds  
I see them from my window  
It's strange to get away now  
To somewhere no-one goes  
I know it's my mistake  
But I don't even know now  
And June becomes July  
And June becomes July

You keep your pretty girls  
Chained inside the dungeon  
And diamonds and pearls  
You keep them a'coming  
Give them all of your affection  
  
You keep your naughty boys  
Locked inside the kitchen  
And when they make a noise  
A swish of your hand keeps them  
Screaming out for your affection  
  
I don't know the why or wherefores  
I don't what's wrong or right  
I just know at night  
You give them all of your affection  
  
You keep your servants down  
Swinging from the gallows  
And when they come round  
Oh you smile and you say hello  
Give them all of your affection  
You give them all of your affection  
You give them all of your affection

Time after time you told me it was the truth  
Time after time you lied to me through your tooth  
How can you sing when everyone writes your song?  
You think you pull the strings and I get strung along  
Baa, baa, baa, baa, baa, baa, baa  
Baa, baa, baa, baa, baa, baa  
Baa, baa, baa, baa, baa, baa, baa  
Baa, baa, baa, baa, baa, baa  
So cry, won't you cry?  
You should have saved that for youth  
And does it elevate the stakes  
When you try to find the truth?  
In the real world, they make real deals  
And it hurts your cause and it clips your heels  
And I would not hesitate to say that I will not be here again  
In the real world  
Baa, raa, baa, baa, baa  
It's not my way to slap you in the face  
When it seems your way to spell dis with a grace  
Where are your friends, they're all moving on  
Why do you get paid when everyone writes your song?  
In the real world but you make the deals  
And it hurts some more till you just can't feel  
And I would not hesitate to say that I will not be here again  
Save the real world for the suits in the cells  
Who only think they're free when freedom sells  
And I would not hesitate to say that I will not be here again  
In the real world, in the real world  
Baa, raa, baa, baa, baa, baa, raa, baa, baa, baa  

We came down the stairs  
And hardly said a word  
And all through the day  
That's all we heard  
And we wanted to know  
Where mariners went wrong  
And all through the day  
We played the same song  
  
And I let the wind blow down my leg  
And I let the rain wash over my face  
'cause I've seen love  
Falling in the rain  
Lightening up the sun  
To show you that you  
Are here again  
  
We lived by the door  
And we hardly knew what for  
And all through the day  
Nothing was heard  
But I still want to know  
Where mariners way went wrong  
And all the same year  
They play the same son  
  
Repeat chorus twice

We used to say  
That come the day  
When we'd all be making songs  
Or finding better words  
These ideas never lasted long  
  
The way is up  
Along the road  
The air is growing thin  
Too many friends who tried  
Were blown off this mountain with the wind  
  
Meet on the ledge  
We're gonna meet on the ledge  
When your time is up you're gonna meet all your friends  
Meet on the ledge  
We're gonna meet on the ledge  
If you really mean it, it all comes round again  
  
So here I sit  
I'm all alone  
But that's the only way to be  
You'll have your chance again  
Then you can do the work for me

Summer death, slow step  
Walk behind the mother of the thirteen year old brown-eyed boy  
Attitudes, attitudes  
Sloganized by middle boots  
The men who slogged the brown-eyed boy  
  
And it's the end of everything that you've been told about  
Decency, honesty  
And it's the end of holding back and breaking bones and building bombs  
And hanging witch-hunts conducted by men of such opinion  
  
Repeat first verse  
  
And it's the end of building roads to load the dead to someone else's field  
And it's the end of falling back on breaking backs and aching handshakes  
And playing fields conducted by men of such opinion  
  
But the fathers crossed you boys  
I fire so heaven knows it only righteous folk  
But righteous taste hold the keys to sitting grace  
To conduct and to proclaim decisions made of such opinions  
  
And it's the time of summer days  
When children sing about the killing fields  
Winter melts the snow and knees will crack on rock  
And the iron on earth beneath the dearth bequeathed  
??? By men of such opinion

What are you going to do today Mrs Jones  
Are you going to chase the pain away Mrs Jones  
Or leave it sitting there waiting outside your door  
Hoping to find the things you hoped would tell you more  
About the dreams that seem to slip away  
  
What are you going to do today Mrs Jones  
Are you going to face the bills to pay Mrs Jones  
Or leave them sitting there waiting outside your door  
Hoping to find the things you hoped would tell you more  
About the dreams that seem to slip away  
  
It's not as if Mr Jones could help in anyway  
It's not as if Mr Jones the bills that he could pay

Oh collector, I'm so sorry  
You had the notion, I was rolling in the money  
No, I'm sorry but I?ll pay you  
No worries  
let's sing softly  
Let's sing softly  
Oh, so softly  
Not so heavy  
I've been heavy with my fortune  
Like a crystal and a hammer  
I'm so sorry, oh collector  
I'm away now in a hurry  
let's sing softly  
Let's sing softly  
Oh, so softly  
Not so heavy  
Get up, all you fighters  
Don't you lie here now  
Get up, all you fighters  
Don't you lie here now  
Oh collector, you had it coming  
It was that funny, we were rolling  
Oh collector, we're so sorry  
And we?ll pay you, no worries  
let's sing softly  
Let's sing softly  
Oh, so softly  
Not so heavy  
let's sing softly  
Let's sing softly  
Oh, so softly  
Not so heavy  
Let's sing softly, oh  

And it looks like one of those days  
When my valentine ain't so funny, yeah  
Ain't so funny, yeah  
And it looks like one of those days  
When I'm holding the same old conversation  
Losing concentration  
And it looks like one of those days  
When my valentine ain't so funny, yeah  
Ain't so funny, yeah  
And it looks like one of those days  
When I'm holding the same old conversation  
And it looks like one of those days  
When I'm losing all my concentration  
And it looks like one of those days  
When my valentine ain't so funny, yeah  
Ain't so funny, yeah  
And it looks like one of those days  
When I'm holding the same old conversation  
And it looks like one of those days  
When I'm losing all my concentration  

Saturday afternoon  
The sunshine pours like wine  
Through your window  
But I know that golden june can turn an empty grey  
'gainst your window  
And I feel like  
I'm on the outside of a circle  
  
And if I walk by the trees  
I catch the falling leaves  
If the wind blows  
But I know that all this means  
Is whiling on the hours  
Watching side-shows  
  
And I feel like  
I'm on the outside of a circle  
  
Will I turn my coat to the rain  
I don't know  
But I'm going somewhere  
I can warm my bones  
  
Fare you well  
I'll carry me away  
And sing to those I know  
Upon their birthdays  
  
I won't feel like like I'm on the outside...  
I won't feel like like I'm on the outside...  
I won't feel like like I'm on the outside of a circle

All the people under broken homes  
Don't wanna fight no more  
All the people nursing shattered bones  
Don't wanna fight no more  
But there's no profit in peace  
So we've gotta fight some more  
  
And all these who are in foreign lands  
Don't wanna fight no more  
And all those those lost their feet or hands  
Don't wanna fight no more  
But there's no profit in peace boys  
We gotta fight some more  
  
hey we don't fight no more  
hey, hey, hey, We don't wanna fight no more  
But there's no profit in peace  
So we gotta fight some more  
  
And all those just trying to play their part  
Don't wanna fight no more  
And all those who own a human heart  
Don't wanna fight no more  
But there's no profit in what you want  
So we must fight some more  
  
And all those who got an axe to grind down  
Don't wanna fight no more  
And all those who got their burning lives  
Don't wanna fight no more  
But there's no profit in ever being right  
So we must fight some more  
  
And all the people under broken homes  
Don't wanna fight no more  
But there is profit in the land you own  
So we must fight some more  
  
And all those who got a tired face  
Don't wanna fight no more  
And all those who are lost without a trace  
Don't wanna fight no more  
But there is profit in the love of hate  
So we must fight some more

There's a question  
Everybody's shouting out a question  
There's a question  
Everybody's shouting out a question  
  
Have you got an answer, politician?  
Have you got an answer, mathematician?  
  
There's a question  
Ringing out a clear loud question  
It's a question  
Giving you one in the head, it's a question  
  
Do you have an answer, theologian?  
A better answer than a politician  
  
There's a question  
  
There's a question  
Ringing out loud in space, there's a question  
And there's a question  
Ringing out over the stage, there's a question  
  
Do you have an answer, politician?  
Do you have an answer, mathematician?  
Do you have an answer, theologian?  
Do you have an answer, science man?  
  
Do you have an answer, Peter Pan?  
Father and son, a mother and daughter  
Son of man  
  
On and on and on and on and on  
And on and on and on and on and on

I'm gonna sail on my boat and keep it afloat forever  
Nobody's gonna tell me how it won't stay together  
I got a waiting ticket won't you sail it  
Nobody's who's staying asleep knows what I'm saying  
  
I'm gonna throw out a rope and keep it afloat it's granted  
Independence  
I'm gonna wake and take us all to where oh  
Nobody's gonna talk me down by stormy weather  
  
Got to sail my boat  
Got to keep afloat  
I get the need to keep on when I'm sailing  
  
I'll sail across don't make it a choice I'll plan it  
Nobody ever thought you wouldn't take you for granted  
I'll tie the ropes that keep me afloat and sailing  
Nobody ever taught me teach what I'm playing  
  
Gonna lift up my voice and sing you a song romantic  
Independence  
  
Repeat [chorus]  
Hold on in love take it to where you never  
Nobody's gonna tell me how it won't stay together  
I've got a freedom ticket lets go sailing  
Nobody's who's staying asleep knows what I'm saying  
  
Repeat [chorus twice]

If anyone rises at 6:31  
And fakes all day that they're having their fun  
They never did get it right  
Since they got it so low.  
  
To anyone drinking the morning away  
The afternoon will prove a mistake  
They never will get it right  
Now they've got it so low.  
  
[Chorus]  
And we laugh and we drink,  
And we teach ourselves not to think.  
We never did get it right  
Since we got it so low.  
  
To all of the faces that freeze for you there  
In your memory when you try not to care  
They never disappear down the slow road  
  
For all of those people who bleed by the side  
And split from their tongues  
And sharpen their knives.  
They never will get a life  
Now they've got it so low  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Cornfields and pig-tails and fish in the stream  
The night when the boys stole the billion dollar dream  
From the high-jinx school for girls  
Down the road.  
  
Stories are smoke trails  
And some may be true.  
You're listening to me  
But I'm talking to you.  
I hope you never fall from grace  
If you get it so low.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And we laugh and we drink  
And we find it hard not to think.  
We never did get it right  
Since we got it so low.

I see double up ahead  
Where the riverboat swayed beneath the sun  
Is where the river runs red  
Like a King who stalks the wings and shoots a dove  
And frees an eagle instead  
It's more or less the same as the things that you said  
  
I see trouble up the road  
Like the things you found in love are by the way  
You like to cheat on your soul  
Like the best and worst of thoughts that lose control  
Before you lie on your bed  
  
It's more or less the same as the things that you said  
Anyway for all the things you know tell me why does the river not flow  
Anyway for all the things you said tell me why does the river run red  
Anyway for all the things you've seen tell me when will the river run green  
And anyway for all the things you know tell me why does the river not flow  
  
It's more or less the things you fail to say in your way that's your trouble  
Like a King who stalks the wings and shoots the moon and the stars  
And his double  
It's more or less the same as the things that you said  
Anyway for all the things you know tell me why does the river not flow  
Anyway for all the things you said tell me why does the river run red  
Anyway for all the things you've seen tell me when will the river run green  
And anyway for all the things you know tell me why does the river not flow  
  
I see trouble up ahead  
Where the river boat swayed beneath the sun  
Is where the river runs red  
I see double, that's my trouble

These are the days  
You have been given  
These are the ones  
These are the ones  
  
These are the times  
We have been given  
These are the ones  
These are the ones  
  
And my dreams are holding  
And my heart is open  
  
These are the times  
They won't be forgiven  
These are the ones  
These are the ones  
  
These are the days  
Please don't forsake them  
These are the ones  
Is everyone  
  
And my dreams are holding  
And my heart is open  
  
These are the ones  
These are the ones  
These are the ones  
These are the ones  
  
And my dreams might shatter  
Still my heart it matters  
  
These are the days  
They won't be forgiven  
These are the ones  
These are the ones

For all of her diction, her self medication  
She fell down and dented her nose  
And laughed at the coroners  
Desperately warning her  
Watch now the way that it goes  
And she knows  
  
She's living at the top of the world  
In need of salvation she spoke to her mother  
Who died in the service of king  
What is the meaning of wallflowers receiving a glance  
It would mean everything  
And she thinks  
  
She's living at the top of the world  
Three minutes later she looked in the mirror  
And cracked half a smile at her toes  
And she knows, she knows  
  
She's living at the top of the world

Where do you go buttoned in your favorite coat  
Stepping out to a different world  
And you might be home late  
And where are you now  
Staring at your favorite box  
The one with the traveler's cross  
On the road past the gate  
  
But if you find yourself standing on the corner  
While you're thinking of a different world  
Then you might see me waiting on the corner  
Staring through you in your different world  
  
And if I could swim  
Then I'd get out and find my boat  
Sail away to my favorite coast  
And let you all in  
And if I could do all the things you're asking for  
Then maybe I'd find your door  
And bring it home to you  
  
But if you find yourself standing on the corner  
While you're thinking of a different world  
Then you might see me waiting on the corner  
Staring through you in your different world  
  
So where do we go  
Like two Christophers in the snow  
Yeah we're blind but we want to know  
Just to say I love you  
And all of our lives  
We'll sail through the suns and moons  
To sing our travelers tune  
Just to say I love you

This England made me  
Between the war and a rockets flying  
You found the crib that saves me  
And teach me wrong and right  
  
Then the world was talking  
It never got it's chance to say  
When there's too much talking  
Nobody hears the words you say  
  
[Chorus]  
You won't see  
Baby now I want you  
These blind communications  
Only last throughout the year  
And half of what we're saying  
Is halfway in a truth  
And blind communications  
For a million hearts and fools  
  
I am a witness  
To a land of a million fools  
All placing bets on life  
Then hate the ones you lose  
And all the lonely  
Never get the chance to say  
That their one and only  
Would be the chance to even play  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hello Monday  
The week is just a blur  
I've been burning bridges  
And now I'm begging at your door  
So I keep on working  
'cause it's a chance for me to pay  
But too much talking  
When you believe the words I say  
  
[Chorus]

Take that face right off yours  
It's not yours love It's not yours love  
You keep yours in a secret cup  
It's flowing over It's flowing over  
And I gave all that I gave you  
I gave all that I dared  
And I took it that I'd claim you  
And I took it that you'd care  
But you love you more than I do  
And I'd love you to be right  
And the wave may crash around you  
And Shipwreck you at night  
  
I'm waving not drowning there's no one looking on  
I'm waving not drowning on the horizon  
  
Raise an arm we won the race  
I'm in your slipstream call it survival  
You wrote the words for me on every wall  
I thank the world for you we're alive-o  
We made it running empty and we drove away our fears  
And we drank the life glass empty but nothing disappears  
And we swam a changing ocean  
Our friends upon the shore  
And we threw so many over  
And watched some others fall  
  
I'm waving not drowning there's no one looking on  
I'm waving not drowning on the horizon

I don't like this  
Anymore than you  
In fact I'm scared  
At the top of the stairs in the dark  
Throw away all the dreams you had  
Slow and broke  
And just for you  
You were barely there  
Hey little girl  
Where's your momma gone?  
Has she left you scared  
At the top of the stairs in the dark  
It's too late for come backs  
And I've been wrong before  
Now I need, I need no more  
Except for you makin' up the sides  
It's too late for come backs  
And I've been wrong before  
Now I need, I need no more  
Except for you makin' up the sides  
Evil is when evil comes  
At the top of the stairs  
At the top of the stairs  
And in the dark  
The world won't listen  
And it gets this scared  
Standing there  
At the top of the stairs in the dark  
Come on baby  
Let's lose this fear  
And let's stand here  
Where it's always fair and never dark  

You are amazing  
It's the truth  
And it's often fading  
Without you  
  
I don't feel the wind blow  
I don't feel the hard rock  
I don't feel it when it breaks your heart  
I don't feel it all get  
To far from the start  
  
You are a lady  
It's the truth  
And it's often shady  
Behind you  
  
I don't feel the hollow  
I don't feel it all broke  
I don't need it when you make your mark  
I don't live in malice  
I need a morning heart  
  
Standing here and hollow  
It's the only thing broke  
And it shakes you and it makes you start  
Like a singing widow  
Which won't mend your heart  
  
You are amazing  
It's the truth

And if I could hold you where would you belong  
Sitting here to reason how the world's gone wrong  
And if I could listen to half the words you say  
Would your pathway glisten and help you on your way  
  
Oh you've got it bad  
But you never should expect cover  
Oh you've got it so bad  
Worse than any other  
  
If I was in your shoes would it be the same  
Would you sit in silence while I dish out the blame  
And if the world was laughing would you close your ears  
There is no creed of chanting to make the world more clear  
  
Oh you've got it bad  
But you never should expect cover  
Oh you've got it so so bad  
Worse than any other  
  
If I bought you flowers would you watch them grow  
Spring time is for certain to follow on the snow  
And if I could hold you where would you belong  
Sitting here to reason how the world's gone wrong  
  
Oh you've got it bad  
But you never should expect cover  
Oh you've got it so so bad  
Worse than any other
