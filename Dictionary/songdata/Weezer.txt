Where I come from isn't all that great  
My automobile is a piece of crap  
My fashion sense is a little whack  
And my friends are just as screwy as me  
  
I didn't go to boarding schools  
Preppie girls never looked at me  
Why should they?  
I ain't nobody, got nothing in my pocket  
  
Beverly Hills, that's where I want to be  
Livin' in Beverly Hills  
Beverly Hills, rolling like a celebrity  
Livin' in Beverly Hills  
  
Look at all those movie stars  
They're all so beautiful and clean  
When the housemaids scrub the floors  
They get the spaces in between  
  
I want to live a life like that  
I want to be just like a king  
Take my picture by the pool  
'Cause I'm the next big thing  
  
Beverly Hills, that's where I want to be  
Livin' in Beverly Hills  
Beverly Hills, rolling like a celebrity  
Livin' in Beverly Hills  
  
The truth is I don't stand a chance  
It's something that you're born into  
And I just don't belong  
  
No I don't, I'm just a no-class beat down fool  
And I will always be that way  
I might as well enjoy my life  
And watch the stars play  
  
Beverly Hills, that's where I want to be  
Livin' in Beverly Hills  
Beverly Hills , rolling like a celebrity  
Livin' in Beverly Hills  
  
Beverly Hills, Beverly Hills  
Beverly Hills, Beverly Hills, livin' in Beverly Hills

I've been scared to make a move,  
So much left for me to prove.  
I guess it's time for me to show what I've got.  
Things will never be the same,  
I may snuff the burning flame.  
Or I may prove to be much more than I thought.  
  
This is the dawning of a brave new world.  
I don't know where I'm going, but I know I'll figure it out, yeah.  
This is the dawning of a brave new world.  
No more hesitating, it's too late to turn back now, yeah.  
  
You can come along with me.  
Or if that's not your destiny,  
You can choose to go your way if you want.  
I will send my best to you,  
There are things I have to do.  
I can't wait no more, I've got to move on.  
  
This is the dawning of a brave new world.  
I don't know where I'm going, but I know I'll figure it out, yeah.  
This is the dawning of a brave new world.  
No more hesitating, it's too late to turn back now, yeah.  
  
It does not take this action,  
To see a chain reaction.  
Everyone, blossoming in the sun.  
  
(Ooh) We'd hate to leave our shelter,  
But there's so much waiting out there.  
If only we'd open our eyes and see.  
Woah woah woah woah  
  
This is the dawning of a brave new world.  
I don't know where I'm going, but I know I'll figure it out, yeah.  
This is the dawning of a brave new world.  
No more hesitating, it's too late to turn our backs now, yeah.

Yesterday I went outside  
With my momma's mason jar  
Caught a lovely Butterfly  
  
When I woke up today  
And looked in on my fairy pet  
She had withered all away  
No more sighing in her breast  
I'm sorry for what I did  
I did what my body told me to  
I didn't mean to do you harm  
But everytime I pin down what I think I want  
It slips away - the ghost slips away  
  
I smell you on my hand for days  
I can't wash away your scent  
If I'm a dog then you're a bitch  
  
I guess you're as real as me  
Maybe I can live with that  
Maybe I need fantasy  
A life of chasing Butterfly  
I told you I would return  
When the robin makes his nest  
But I ain't never comin' back  
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry

You told me you would be here by my side  
Warming my heart on this cold winter's night  
  
Here I sit waiting beside the tree all by myself  
  
You told me you would bring presents and treats (K-R-O-Q CD  
Original)  
Cheering my spirits with homemade sweet meats (K-R-O-Q CD

You told me you would move heaven and earth (promo CD remix)  
Cheering my spirits with laughter and mirth (promo CD remix)  
  
Here I sit waiting beside the tree all by myself  
  
Oh, could you ever know how much I care?  
Could you ever know that out somewhere  
There's a boy who really hurts?  
  
Since I've found you  
I've found a girl  
I've found a thorn  
I've found a queen  
Now I am warm

Debt  
On my head  
Wasting time  
On my own  
  
Sleep  
Rescue me  
Take me back  
To my home  
  
[Chorus:]  
For the times  
That you want to go and  
Bust rhymes real slow  
I'll appear  
Slap you on the face and  
Enjoy the show  
  
Cheese  
Smells so good  
On a burnt  
Piece of lamb  
  
Fag  
Of the year  
Who could beat  
Up your man?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ohhhh  
This dope nose  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ohhhh  
This dope nose

Goddamn you half-Japanese girls  
Do it to me every time  
Oh, the redhead said you shred the cello  
And I'm jello, baby  
But you won't talk, won't look, won't think of me  
I'm the epitome of Public Enemy  
Why you want to go and do me like that?  
Come down on the street and dance with me  
  
I'm a lot like you so please Hello, I'm here, I'm waiting  
I think I'd be good for you and you'd be good for me  
  
I asked you to go to the Green Day concert  
You said you never heard of them  
How cool is that?  
So I went to your room and read your diary:  
"watching Grunge leg-drop New-Jack trough presstable..."  
And then my heart stopped:  
"Listening to Cio-Cio San fall in love all over again."  
  
How stupid is it? I can't talk about it  
I gotta sing about it and make a record of my heart  
How stupid is it? won't you gimme a minute  
Just come up to me and say "hello" to my heart  
How stupid is it? For all I know you want me too  
And maybe you just don't know what to do  
Or maybe you're scared to say: "I'm falling for you"  
  
I wish I could get my head out of the sand  
'Cause I think we'd make a good team  
And you would keep my fingernails clean  
But that's just a stupid dream that I won't realize  
'Cause I can't even look in your eyes without shakin', and I ain't fakin'  
I'll bring home the turkey if you bring home the bacon

When I was younger  
I used to go and tip cows for fun, yeah  
Actually I didn't do that  
Cause I didn't want the cow to be sad  
But some of my friends did  
They were all just a little bit wicked  
They'd blow up mail boxes  
With a baseball bat  
Go for direct hits  
  
I know how to win you can forget it  
They throw rotten eggs into traffic  
Toilet paper the fences  
Throw the tables, chairs, and the benches  
After practice  
Sometimes we would break into mad fits  
Causin' damage  
(Burnin' amplifiers and mic stands)  
  
[Chorus]  
Everybody get dangerous  
Everybody get dangerous (Boo yah!)  
Everybody get dangerous  
Everybody get dangerous (Boo yah!)  
Everybody get dangerous  
Everybody get dangerous (Boo yah!)  
Everybody get dangerous  
Everybody get dangerous  
  
I've got a confession  
That I will make if you will listen  
Late in the nighttimes  
We'd drive around with hairspray and sharp knives  
Lookin' for road kills  
Lightin' things on fire for cheap thrills  
Stab the corpses  
And lick the knives like we're evil forces  
  
Hockey games on frozen ponds  
No safety pads were ever put on  
Drivin' home on country roads  
Sixty-five in a twenty-five zone  
In my parents Tercel  
How did we survive so well  
Throw the keys and the wheel locked up  
I almost killed every one us  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There must be  
A guardian angel  
Or some kind of destiny we have  
Cause we should have died  
A long time ago  
The way that we were livin' in our paths  
  
What will we say when our kids come to us  
And ask, with a smile on their face,  
"Hey Dad, my friend's got some new ninja swords!  
Is it cool if we slash up his place?"  
Hey  
Hey  
Hey ("Is it cool if we slash up his place?")  
And get dangerous  
  
[Chorus]

We go together baby  
And if we do  
Yeah  
I'll be your weakness baby  
And get to you  
  
Stream line  
Main line  
Fall together  
Get up  
  
Anytime you want me baby  
I'll be around  
Yeah  
That's what they'll teach you baby  
To dig my sound  
  
Stream line  
Main line  
Fall together  
Get up  
  
Get up  
Get up  
  
Yeah  
  
Stream line  
Main line  
Fall together  
Get up  
  
Get up  
Get up  
  
Yeah  
Yeah  
Yeah

City streets at night  
Can be so intimidating  
I'm not the toughest guy  
I gotta keep my eyes open  
You came out of nowhere  
  
[Chorus:]  
Man you really freak me out  
I'm so afraid of you  
And when I lose my cool  
I don't know what to do  
I know you don't mean no harm  
Your just doing your thing  
But man you really freak me out  
  
Did I hurt you?  
Are you okay?  
Can I buy you a drink?  
Ohhh what's the world coming to?  
You came out of nowhere  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm gonna try to improve my manners (manners)  
Everyone, yes everyone, is my friend!  
  
City streets at night (city streets at night)  
City streets at night (city streets at night)  
'Til the morning light ('til the morning light)  
City streets at night (city streets at night)  
  
[Chorus]

This is beginning to hurt  
This is beginning to be serious  
It used to be a game  
Now it's a cryin' shame  
'cause you don't want to play around no more  
  
Sometimes I push too hard  
Sometimes you fall and skin your knee  
I never meant to do  
All that I've done to you  
Please baby say it's not too late  
To get you, uh-huh  
  
You know this is breakin' me up  
You think that I'm some kind of freak  
But if you'd come back to me  
Then you would surely see  
That I'm just foolin' around  
  
To get you, uh-huh  
  
I can't believe  
What you've done to me  
What I did do them  
You've done to me

Gonna make my move  
Gonna make it stay  
Gonna make it last  
Nevermind the past  
Living for today  
  
Hey (hey) Hey (hey)  
You know what you want me to say  
  
Right (right)  
Fight (fight)  
We can start a glorious day  
  
Gonna take a chance  
Gonna rock and dance  
Gonna hit the ground  
With a brand new sound  
Lookin' for romance  
  
Hey (hey) Hey  
You know what you want me to say  
  
Right (right)  
Fight (fight)  
We can start a glorious day  
  
Glorious children on my mind  
Glorious wastings of my time  
Glorious friends we make up  
Forcing things in rhyme  
  
Hey (hey) Hey  
You know what you want me to say  
  
Right (right)  
Fight (fight)  
We can start a glorious day  
  
Glorious children on my mind  
Glorious wastings of my time  
Glorious friends we make up  
Forcing things in rhyme  
  
Gonna rock it out  
Gonna scream and shout  
Gonna do it right  
Standing in the light  
Flexing all our clout  
  
Gonna do it right  
Standing in the light  
Flexing all our clout  
  
Gonna do it right  
Standing in the light  
Flexing all our clout  
  
Hey-ey-ey

Let's go away for a while  
You and I  
To a strange and distant land  
Where they speak no word of truth  
But we don't understand anyway  
  
[Chorus:]  
Holiday  
Far away, to stay  
On a Holiday, far away  
Let's go today  
In a heartbeat!  
Heartbeat, heartbeat  
  
Don't bother to pack your bags  
Or your map  
We won't need them where we're goin'  
We're goin' where the wind is blowin'  
Not knowin' where we're gonna stay  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We will write a postcard  
To our friends and family  
In free verse  
On the road with Kerouac  
Sheltered in Bivouac  
On this road we'll never die...  
  
Let's go away for a while  
You and I  
To a strange and distant land  
Where they speak no word of truth  
But we don't understand anyway  
  
[Chorus]

All the times you came  
I should've ran away  
  
You told me that you'd always love me  
You told me that you'd always love me  
  
And the games you played  
Were meant to lead me on  
  
You told me that you'd always love me  
You told me that you'd always love me  
Always, oooh always  
I do  
  
You told me that you'd always love me  
You told me that you'd always love me  
Always, oooh always  
I do  
  
Never more again  
Will I believe the sun

All the times you came to me and told me that you cared  
I was dreaming of happy days that we both could share  
Maybe I got too excited, and maybe you freaked out  
Maybe I just have to call you up and scream and shout  
  
All of my friends tell me that I ought to play it cool  
No one likes too much attention from a desperate fool  
Still I don't believe that I can keep it all inside  
When I see your pretty face, I almost want to cry  
  
I know it isn't right  
But still I have to fight  
I have to let you know  
I don't wanna let you go  
  
The pain is killing me  
But I can't let it be  
I have to let you know  
I don't wanna let you go  
  
I remember the days when I was stronger than a wall  
Try as anybody might, they couldn't move me at all  
Now I fall to pieces when you softly call my name  
Going up in smoke rings like a moth within your flame  
  
I have lost all hope of being normal once again  
I will be a slave to you until the bitter end  
Even if it's a hundred years before you change your mind  
I will be here waiting girl until the end of time  
  
I know it isn't right  
But still I have to fight  
I have to let you know  
I don't wanna let you go  
  
The pain is killing me  
But I can't let it be  
I have to let you know  
I don't wanna let you go  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
I know it isn't right  
But still I have to fight  
I have to let you know  
I don't wanna let you go  
  
The pain is killing me  
But I can't let it be  
I have to let you know  
I don't wanna let you go  
  
Oh, oh

I'm so tall, can't get over me  
I'm so low, can't get under me  
I must be all these things  
For I just threw out the love of my dreams  
  
He is in my eyes, he is in my ears  
He is in my blood, he is in my tears  
I think of, and see him every day  
Even though my love is a world away  
  
Oh he's got me wondering  
My righteousness is crumbling  
  
Never before have I felt this way  
No one is right, want for him to stay  
I must be made of steel  
For I just threw out the love of my dreams  
  
He is in my eyes, he is in my ears  
He is in my blood, he is in my tears  
I think of, and see him every day  
Even though my love is a world away  
  
Oh, he's got me wondering  
My righteousness is crumbling  
Oh, he's got me wondering  
My righteousness is crumbling  
  
Oh, he's got me wondering  
My righteousness is crumbling  
And I see him every day  
Even though my love has walked away  
  
He is in my eyes, he is in my ears  
He is in my blood, he is in my tears  
I must be made of steel  
For I just threw out the love of my dreams

It's been two and a half years now that we've been apart  
I've kind of spaced out lately  
Can't seem to get you out of my mind  
I really miss you girl, I really do  
You think I'm crazy but I swear it's true  
You think I'd have given up  
Found somebody new  
But that girls got what you've got, I belong to you  
I really miss you girl, I really do  
You think I'm crazy but I swear it's true  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh(2x)  
I really miss you girl, I really do  
You think I'm crazy but I swear it's true  
I swear it's true(2x) I really do I swear it's true..

4 in the morning  
And my roommate's still a-snoring  
So I take a walk out on the Boulevard  
  
The wind above me  
Seems to push and pull and shove me  
But it shows me all the places I could fly  
  
I want to be something  
Before I die  
I feel it burning me inside  
  
I want to be something  
I don't know why  
I want to know that at least I tried  
  
I see so clearly  
That the odds are stacked against me  
And that nobody else believes in me at all  
  
I'm all alone here  
And I have to face my own fear  
I have no choice but to keep on keeping on  
  
I want to be something  
Before I die  
I feel it burning me inside, whoa  
  
I want to be something  
I don't know why  
I want to know that at least I tried  
  
And if my dreams all come true someday, true someday  
I won't forget how I feel today, I feel today  
I'm blown away  
  
I wanna be somethin'  
I wanna be somethin'  
I wanna be somethin'  
I wanna be somethin'  
I wanna be somethin'  
I wanna be somethin'  
I wanna be somethin'  
I wanna be somethin'  
  
Here I am, here I am  
  
I want to be something  
Before I die  
I feel it burning me inside, whoa  
  
I want to be something  
I want to feel something  
I want to know that at least I tried

The moon was shining on the lake at night  
The Slayer t-shirt fit the scene just right  
Smeared mascara, I looked into your eyes, I saw a light  
  
You told me stories about your chickadees  
They didn't like B-B guns or stupid archery  
You charmed the lifeguard, to let them use the pool all day for free  
  
Then the conversation stopped, and I looked down at my feet  
I was next to you and you were right there next to me  
And I said girl!  
If you're wondering if I want you to, (I want you to) I want you to  
So make a move, (Make a move) 'cause I ain't got all night  
  
The rest of the summer was the best we ever had  
We watched Titanic, and it didn't make us sad  
I took you to Best Buy, you took me home to meet your Mom and Dad  
  
Your Mom cooked meatloaf even though I don't eat meat  
I dug you so much, I took some for the team  
Your dad was silent, his eyes were fixed on what was on TV  
  
Then the conversation stopped, and I looked down at the ring  
Your folks were next to you, and you were right there next to me  
And I said girl!  
If you're wondering if I want you to, (I want you to) I want you to (I want
you to)  
I swear it's true (I swear it's true) without you, my heart is blue  
Girl!  
If you're wondering if I want you to, (I want you to) I want you to  
So make a move, (Make a move) 'cause I ain't got all night  
  
So much pain may come our way  
There may come a day when we have nothing left to say  
When the conversation stops, and we're facing our defeat  
I'll be next to you and you'll be right there next to me  
  
Then I'll say girl!  
If you're wondering if I want you to, (I want you to) I want you to (I want
you to)  
I swear it's true (I swear it's true) without you, my heart is blue  
Girl!  
If you're wondering if I want you to, (I want you to) I want you to  
So make a move, (Make a move) 'cause I ain't got all night

I thought tonight would suck like every other night  
I'd party with my friends  
But when I saw you grooving on the dance floor  
Normal came to an end  
  
We started talking and man, it was so clear to me  
There's no one else like you  
You got the brains, the body, and the beauty  
To top it off, you're cool  
  
[Chorus]  
This ain't impossible  
This ain't improbable  
You are my baby tonight  
And I'm your daddy  
This ain't believable  
This ain't predictable  
You are my baby tonight  
And I'm your daddy  
  
I hope that I ain't freaking you out  
You probably hear it all the time  
I swear I ain't like those other boys  
I'm a special kind  
  
I would like to give a demonstration  
Of what it is I do  
I'll take you out to dinner at Palermo's  
We'll split a cheese fondue  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I will egg the goomba  
If you tire  
Try my best to moonwalk  
On the wire  
  
I just want to, oh ah,  
Feel your fire  
Feel your fire  
Feel your fire!  
  
[Chorus]

Jamie, what you doin' now  
What you doin' now girl?  
Please, please tell me  
'Cause I need to know, I need to know now  
  
When I was down, you came to me  
And promised you'd always be  
By my side, now you're gone  
And I'm waiting patiently  
Jamie, I want you to know  
Jamie, Jamie, I'm so glad you're mine  
We'll be together a long time  
  
Jamie, what ya doing now?  
Who's dialin' your car phone?  
Please, please be true  
You know that I trust you, do that which you must do  
  
Chorus  
You've got the Beach Boys, and your firm's got the Stones  
But I know you won't leave me alone  
Sometimes it seems you're not with me  
It hurts me so much, It hurts me so much  
Sometimes it seems you're not with me  
It hurts me so much, It hurts me so much  
You are the most, you're so rad, you're so fresh  
And I'm so glad I am yours, you are mine  
Show me where and I will sign  
  
Chorus  
Jaime, believe me, I won't let you down  
'cause you are the best lawyer in town  
Sometimes it seems you're not with me  
It hurts me so much, It hurts me so much  
Sometimes it seems you're not with me  
It hurts me so much, It hurts me so much  
I love you so much, I love you so much

You'll never be  
A better kind  
If you don't leave  
The world behind  
  
Waste my days  
(Waste my days)  
Drown aways  
(Drown aways)  
  
[Chorus:]  
It's just the thought of you  
In love with someone else  
It breaks my heart to see  
You hangin' from your shelf  
  
You'll never do  
The things you want  
If you don't move  
And get a job  
  
Waste my days  
(Waste my days)  
Drown aways  
(Drown aways)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh girl when I'm in love with you  
Keep fishin' if you feel it's true  
There's nothing much that we can do  
To save you from yourself  
  
Waste my days  
(Waste my days)  
Drown aways  
(Drown aways)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh girl when I'm in love with you  
Keep fishin' if you feel it's true  
There's nothing much that we can do  
To save you from yourself  
  
You'll never be  
A better kind  
You'll never be  
A better kind  
  
Whoa ohh  
Whoa ohh (x 7)  
  
Waste my days  
Waste my days (x 7)

One night at the disco I wanted to dance slow  
I saw a sweet baby, such a fine lady  
I walked up to ask her, but some dude just grabbed her  
I told him to back off, cut me some slack off  
I see you come here, drinkin' that cheap beer  
Act like you own it, I can't condone it  
You show me now respect, you got to get off it  
You got to get with it. Time for a swift kick  
You see, I own this town. You best not come around  
If you wanna get by, then cool it down  
If you wanna start something, know one thing: I'm king.  
If you wanna mess around like that, that's just how it is  
If you wanna get by, then mind your biz.  
If you wanna start something, know one thing: I'm king  
  
You wanted attention and did I mention:  
Nobody likes you, except for the losers  
You made a whole army, an army of babies  
Some of them stupid, some of them crazy  
Pick up your action, act like a grown man  
Look at the winners, you can be like them  
Life is so easy, pleasant, and dreamy  
If you get off me, if you get with me  
You see I own this town. You best not come around  
If you wanna get by, then cool it down.  
If you wanna start something, know one thing: I'm king  
If you wanna mess around like that, that's just how it is  
If you wanna get by, then mind your biz  
If you wanna start something, know one thing: I'm king  
  
You can't break me  
Never take me  
That's just how it is  
You can't break me  
Never shake me  
Clear out of my biz

Any day now you'll call me up on the phone  
Say you love me more than you ever did before  
  
It's all that I can do right now  
To make it up to you somehow  
And meet you on the other side of home  
  
Take no prisoners here in this knock-down drag-out war  
That we're waging on each other forever more  
  
It's all that I can do right now  
To make it up to you somehow  
And meet you on the other side of home  
Say you love me now  
  
It's all that I can do right now  
To make it up to you somehow  
And meet you on the other side of home  
Say you love me now  
  
Take no prisoners here in this knock-down drag-out war  
That we're waging on each other forever more  
That we're waging on each other forever more

I was driving this morning and sat in traffic on the way to work, work  
Soon as I got in, my boss was tripping and acting like a freaking jerk, jerk  
Me and my girl ain't speak in weeks and I can't remember the reason why, why,
why  
On top of that it's a recession, I feel like Jay-Z, this can't be life, life  
  
[Chorus]  
Tonight I'm leaving all my worries and my problems in the house  
I'm going out with my homies and we gonna let it, gonna let it  
All hang out, let it all hang out  
It's the last day of the weekend, boy I need to release  
And let it all hang out, let it all hang out  
I'm going out with my homies and we gonna let it all hang out  
  
Time for me to leave this place, don't feel like its going to come, come, come  
I got bills on top of bills and I don't know where I'm getting my money from,
from  
The walls feel like their closing in,  
I honestly don't feel like I can make it, make it, make it  
I'm so mad and I can't take it, that's why  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Me and JD chilling in the shack  
Sharing Chiclets from the same pack  
One hundred and eighty-proof vitamin water  
Energy flavor  
Take us to your daughter  
I want to see you pretty ladies on the dance floor (dance floor)  
Put your hands up in the air like you don't care no more (we don't care no
more)  
We gonna hit the town tonight, we were born to rock  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Let it all hang out)  
I'm going out with my homies, and we gonna let it all hang out

Take a listen  
Around you  
All the people  
That crowd around  
In your house  
  
They've been wanting  
To kill you  
In your sleep  
  
Take a load off  
And bow down  
To the others  
Who love to call you their names  
  
They've been wanting  
To kill you  
In your sleep  
  
And all the bull  
That people sling  
It doesn't matter  
What they sing  
  
So jump out  
Jump out  
Get your groove on  
This one  
Is for you  
So come on  
Get out  
Your house girl  
And give me a kiss  
  
And all the bull  
That people sling  
It doesn't matter  
What they sing  
  
So jump out  
Jump out  
Get your groove on  
This one  
Is for you  
So come on  
Get out  
Your house girl  
And give me a kiss  
  
Take a load off  
And bow down  
To the others  
Who love to call you their names  
  
They love to call you their names  
They love to call you their names

Summer 1988  
Never though you'd graduate  
Playin with your guns all day  
  
If only they could see you now  
And how you've learned to shoot so well  
They wouldn't talk that way  
  
[Chorus:]  
Wayne, you know it's true  
There's nothing you can do  
So put those guns away  
Who cares it's wrong or right  
So please give up the fight  
And put those guns away  
  
All of your freinds are through  
They've given up what they tried to do  
See now how happy they are  
  
Each with a new lease on life  
A brand new car and a milage wife  
Doo doo doo doooo doo doo...

Pissing in plastic cups before we went on stage  
Playing hackey sack back when Audioslave were still Rage  
Watching all the freaky Dutch kids vomit then have sex  
Listening to techno music on the bus while we under dressed  
  
[Chorus]  
Memories make me want to go back there, back there  
All the memories make me want to go back there, back there  
All the memories, how can we make it back there, back there  
I want to be there again  
  
Messing with the journalists and telling stupid lies  
They had a feeling that something was up  
Because of the look in our eyes  
In fact we didn't know what we were doing half of the time  
We were so sure of ourselves and sure of our way of life  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now I got so many people that I got to look out for  
I never know when I'll become away and buy some food at the store  
I can hear them babies crying and the lawn needs to be mowed  
I gotta get my groove on 'cause I'm freakin' bored!  
  
[Chorus]

My name is Jonas  
I'm carrying the wheel  
Thanks for all you've shown us  
But this is how we feel  
Come sit next to me  
Pour yourself some tea  
Just like grandma made  
When we couldn't find sleep  
Things were better then  
Once but never again  
We've all left the den  
Let me tell you 'bout it  
  
The choo-choo train left right on time  
A ticket costs only your mind  
The driver said hey man we go all the way  
Of course we were willing to pay  
  
My name is Wepeel  
I gotta box full of your toys  
They're fresh out of batteries  
But they're still makin' noise  
Tell me what to do  
Now the tank is dry  
Now this wheel is flat  
And you know what else?  
Guess what I received  
In the mail today  
Words of deep concern  
From my little brother  
  
The building's not goin' as he planned  
The foreman has injured his hand  
The dozer will not clear a path  
The driver swears he learned his math  
The workers are goin' home!  
  
My name is jonas

My girl's got a big mouth  
With which she blabbers a lot  
She laughs at most everything  
Whether it's funny or not  
And if you see her  
Tell her it's over now  
  
[Chorus]  
I want a girl who will laugh for no one else  
When I'm away she puts her makeup on the shelf  
When I'm away she never leaves the house  
I want a girl who laughs for no one else  
  
My girl's got eyeballs  
In the back of her head  
She looks around and around  
You know it makes me sad to see her like that  
Please don't believe her, she says that for anyone  
And if you see her  
Tell her its hey hey hey hey  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And if you see her  
Tell her it's over now  
And if you watch her go  
Watch her, watch her, watch her, watch her!  
  
[Chorus]

My girl's a liar  
But I'll stand beside her  
She's all I've got  
And I don't want to be alone  
  
My girl don't see me  
When she's with my friends  
She's all I've got  
And I don't want to be alone  
  
No there is no other one  
No there is no other one  
I can't have any other one  
Though I would  
Now I never could with one  
  
All of the drugs she does  
Scare me real good  
She's got a tattoo  
And two pet snakes  
But nobody knows me like her  
Nobody knows her like me  
We're all we've got  
And we don't want to be alone

Oh come all ye faithful  
Joyful and triumphant  
Oh come ye, oh come ye to Bethlehem  
Come and behold Him  
Born the King of Angels  
  
Oh come, let us adore Him  
Oh come, let us adore Him  
Oh come, let us adore Him  
Christ the Lord  
  
Oh sing choirs of angels, sing in exultation  
Sing all that hear in Heaven God's holy word  
Give to our Father glory in the highest  
  
Oh come, let us adore Him  
Oh come, let us adore Him  
Oh come, let us adore Him  
Christ the Lord  
  
Word of the Father now in flesh appearing  
Oh come, let us adore Him  
Oh come, let us adore Him  
Oh come, let us adore Him  
Christ the Lord

I miss you  
And I wonder how you feel about me too  
Do you miss the way we were  
And how we used to be  
Suddenly  
We're apart and I can't see you everynight  
Do miss the way we loved  
And I can't feel your touch  
  
Oooo girlfriend  
That's the end  
And I'm lost without your love,  
Oh love.  
  
In your arms  
I was happy as a little boy could be  
Taking pills and medicine  
Now I just want to shout  
For you love  
'Cause I'm drifting further from you every day  
Driving by your place every night  
I used to feel all right  
  
Oooo girlfriend  
That's the end  
And I'm lost without your love  
Oh love  
  
Feeling ancy every night  
When I dream to be all right  
Oh love  
Oh love  
  
Ooo girlfriend  
That's the end  
And I'm lost with out your love  
Oh love  
  
In your arms  
I was happy as a little boy could be  
Taking pills and medicine  
Now I just want to shout  
La la la la la la la la la..  
Now I just want to shout  
La la la la la la la la la....  
Now I just want to shout

Oh holy night, the stars are brightly shining  
It is the night of the dear Savior's birth  
Long lay the world in sin and error pining  
'Till He appeared and the soul felt it's worth  
  
A thrill of hope the weary soul rejoices  
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn  
Fall on your knees, oh hear the angel voices  
Oh night divine, oh night when Christ was born  
Oh night, oh holy night, oh night divine  
  
Truly He taught us to love one another  
His law is love and His gospel is peace  
Chains shall He break for the slave is our brother  
And in His name all oppression shall cease  
  
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we  
Let all within us praise His holy name  
Christ is the Lord, oh praise His name forever  
His power and glory ever more proclaim  
His power and glory ever more proclaim  
  
Oh night divine, oh night when Christ was born  
Oh night, oh holy night, oh night divine

I got a PC, you got a Mac  
I'm giving you flak for your airport  
I read books and you watch TV  
You wanna be free to relax more  
  
But when I think about the other people I could see  
Nobody else out there could ever make me happy  
I wonder how we came to be  
  
The odd couple is what we are in reality  
But we are so happy in everything we do  
The odd couple is what they're saying of you and me  
But we know the feeling that we share is true  
  
Sometimes I want to strangle your neck  
Or write you a check to get going  
There's only so much more I can take  
I made a mistake without knowing  
  
But when I think about the way you little heart beats  
When I am holding you and you are holding onto me  
I wonder how we came to be  
  
The odd couple is what we are in reality  
But we are so happy in everything we do  
The odd couple is what they're saying of you and me  
But we know the feeling that we share is true  
  
I hope you know that I don't mean you disrespect  
I'm just pointing out, although the facts I double-checked  
Everyone can see that we ain't two peas in a pod  
But maybe that's our chemistry that takes us to the top  
  
I think it's working baby, that's the point I'm trying to make  
If I said something else to you then I would be a fake  
I wonder how we came to be  
I wonder how we came to be  
I wonder how we came to be  
  
The odd couple is what we are in reality  
But we are so happy in everything we do  
The odd couple is what they're saying of you and me  
But we know the feeling that we share is true  
The odd couple  
The odd couple  
The odd couple  
The odd couple  
  
Yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah

You can't resist her  
She's in your bones  
She's in your marrow  
And your ride home  
You can't avoid her  
She's in the air  
In between molecules  
Of oxygen and carbon dioxide  
  
Only in dreams  
We see what it means  
Reach out our hands  
Hold on to hers  
But when we wake  
It's all been erased  
And so it seems  
Only in dreams  
  
You walk up to her  
Ask her to dance  
She says "hey baby  
I just might take the chance"  
You say "It's a good thing  
That you float in the air  
That way there's no way  
I will crush your pretty toenails into a thousand pieces."  
  
Only in dreams  
We see what it means  
Reach out our hands  
Hold on to hers  
But when we wake  
It's all been erased  
And so it seems  
Only in dreams

I tried my best  
I gave my all  
Sometimes my best wasn't good enough  
For you  
Sometimes I let you go  
Sometimes I hurt you so  
I know that I can be the meanest person in the world  
  
[Chorus:]  
So I apologize to you  
And to anyone else that I hurt too  
I may not be the perfect soul  
But I can't learn self control  
So pardon me! pardon me! pardon me my friend!  
  
I never thought  
That anyone  
Was more important than the plans  
I made  
But now I feel the shame  
There's no one else to blame  
For all the broken hearts scattered on the field of war  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Sometimes I let you go  
Sometimes I hurt you sooo!  
I know that I can be the meanest person in the world..  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
So pardon me  
Pardon me  
Pardon me my friend  
Pardon meeeee  
My friendddd  
Pardon meee  
My frienddd...

More and more I can't say no  
So afraid of letting go  
If there's something I can grab  
You can bet I'll pay the tab  
Counting all the flowers  
Waste the precious hours  
I need to find some peace  
  
All these problems on my mind  
Make it hard for me to think  
There is no way I can stop  
My poor brain is gonna pop  
And I don't have a purpose  
Scattered on the surface  
I need to find some peace  
  
Woah  
  
And all the broken tethers  
We can bring together  
I need to find some peace  
  
I need to find some peace  
I need to find some peace

If you want it (oo-oo-oo)  
You can have it (oo-oo-oo)  
But you gotta learn to reach up there  
And grab it (oo-oo-oo)  
  
'Cause everybody wants some love (oh baby)  
Shoot it from the stars above (oh baby)  
And though my heart would break  
It's more than I can take  
I can never get enough  
  
If you need it (oo-oo-oo)  
You should show it (oo-oo-oo)  
'Cause at my place overnight  
Suggest you grow it (oo-oo-oo)  
  
'Cause everybody wants some hope (oh baby)  
Something they can barely know (oh baby)  
And though my heart would break  
It's more than I could take  
I can never let it go  
  
It's in the photograph  
It's in the photograph  
It's in the photograph of love  
  
'Cause everybody wants a dream (oh baby)  
Something they can barely see (oh baby)  
And though my heart would break  
It's more than I could take  
I could never let it be  
  
It's in the photograph  
It's in the photograph  
It's in the photograph of love  
  
If you blew it (oo-oo-oo)  
Don't reject it (oo-oo-oo)  
Just keep drawing up the plans and re-erect it  
(oo-oo-oo) (x 3)

When I'm stable long enough  
I start to look around for love  
See a sweet in floral print  
My mind begins the arrangements  
But when I start to feel that pull  
Turns out I just pulled myself  
She would never go with me  
Were I the last girl on earth  
  
I'm dumb she's a lesbian  
I thought I had found the one  
We were good as married in my mind  
But married in my mind's no good  
A pink triangle on her sleeve  
Let me know the truth, let me know the truth  
  
Might have smoked a few in my time  
But never thought it was a crime  
Knew the day would surely come  
When I'd chill and settle down  
When I think I've found a good old-fashioned girl  
Then she put me in my place  
If everyone's a little queer  
Can't she be a little straight?

One, two, three, four  
  
When I walk  
Down the street  
I been trippin' on my feet  
  
And my clothes  
They don't match  
And my blue jeans need a patch  
  
It's cold outside  
Is there someone there tonight  
It's cold outside  
Won't you let me come inside and make it right  
  
Here it's clear, that I'm not getting better  
When I fall down, you put me back together  
  
What I do, isn't cool  
And my lips are lined with drool  
I'm a mess, since you left  
You can use this fool, I'm gonna use this too  
  
It's cold outside  
Is there someone there tonight  
It's cold outside  
Would you let me come inside, and make it right  
  
Here, it's clear, that I'm not getting better  
When I fall down, you put me back together  
I'm alone, in my room, I don't know what to do  
When I fall down, you put me back together  
(You put me back together)  
  
And when I day dream  
When eating ice cream  
It's such a nice scene  
  
But then I wake up crying  
I know I just been lying  
  
Here, it's clear, that I'm not getting better (that I'm not getting better)  
When I fall down, you put me back together (put me back together)  
Right, it's clear, that I'm not getting better (that I'm not getting better)  
When I fall down, you put me back together  
  
I'm alone, in my room, I don't know what to do  
When I fall down you put me back together

Ring ring goes your telephone  
You act like you ain't at home  
You shut me out, but it turns me on  
Red lipstick, black dresses  
A look that I should not mess with  
It makes us boys go crazy for you  
  
So fascinated  
I'm anticipating the touch  
That may never come  
  
[Chorus]  
In the rain  
In the sun  
Everybody needs someone  
They can dream of all night long  
All the pain  
And the ways  
That you're driving me insane  
It's no mystery why you're ruling me  
  
We first met in the lunch room  
My ocular nerve went, pop, zoom  
I never observed such a beautiful face  
Sweet lady, don't play me  
If I am a knob, don't fade me  
You can't win the game if you pass the ace  
  
I'm so frustrated  
This love's belated, methinks  
Let's get it to go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm not kidding anymore  
This love hurts, that's for sure  
I feel you, I see you,  
I need you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's no mystery why you're ruling me

Oh yeah  
Alright  
  
Somebody's Heine'  
Is crowdin' my icebox  
Somebody's cold one  
Is givin' me chills  
Guess I'll just close my eyes  
  
Oh yeah  
Alright  
Feels good  
Inside  
  
Flip on the tele  
Wrestle with Jimmy  
Something is bubbling  
Behind my back  
The bottle is ready to blow  
  
Say it ain't so  
Your drug is a heart breaker  
Say it ain't so  
My love is a life taker  
  
I can't confront you  
I never could do  
That which might hurt you  
So try and be cool  
When I say  
This way is a water slide away from me  
That takes you further every day  
So be cool  
  
Say it ain't so  
Your drug is a heart breaker  
Say it ain't so  
My love is a life taker  
  
Dear Daddy  
I write you in spite of years of silence  
You've cleaned up, found Jesus, things are good or so I hear  
This bottle of Steven's awakens ancient feelings  
Like father, stepfather, the son is drowning in the flood  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
Say it ain't so  
Your drug is a heart breaker  
Say it ain't so  
My love is a life taker

Open the door  
And let your love come down  
Over the wall  
You're spinning 'round and 'round  
'Cause you wanted some love  
I'll make it happen  
  
'Cause I don't want to break  
You find things I can't take  
You say you want to wrap me up  
Inside your smile  
  
Open your heart  
And let the good stuff out  
Water me girl  
And let me ease the drought  
  
'Cause you wanted some love  
I'll make it happen  
  
'Cause I don't want to break  
You find things I can't take  
The way you want to wrap me up  
Inside your smile  
  
I can't be gone...darlin'  
For very long...oh  
Let me know what you're gonna do  
Standing there deep in front of you  
Take a look in between my eyes  
'Cause I'm back...yeah  
  
'Cause I don't want to break  
You find things I can't take  
The way you want to wrap me up  
Inside your smile  
  
I can't be gone...darlin'  
For very long...oh  
Let me know what you're gonna do  
Standing there deep in front of you  
Take a look in between my eyes  
Because I'm back...yeah  
  
Give me a chance  
If you can force yourself  
Look at me girl  
And get up off your shelf  
  
You wanted some love  
I'll make it happen

Ooo-hoo hoo hoo hoo-oo-oo (x 2)  
  
You want to cry  
When you're dealing with the kids  
  
Ooo-hoo hoo hoo hoo-oo-oo (x 2)  
They know it all  
And they're pinning you to boards  
  
It's a game  
And you play  
But you can't have fun  
When all they do is say  
Lies  
  
They know it all  
And they're pinning you to boards  
  
It's a game  
And you play  
But you can't have fun  
Whne all they do is say  
Lies  
Lies

[Chorus:]  
The sea is foamin' like a bottle of beer  
The wave is comin but I ain't gonna fear  
I'm waxin' down so that I'll go real fast  
I'm waxin' down because it's really a blast  
I'm goin' surfin 'cause I don't like your face  
I'm bailin' out because I hate the race  
Of rats that run round and round in the maze  
I'm goin' surfin', I'm goin' surfin'!  
  
You take your car to work  
I'll take my board  
And when you run out of fuel  
I'm still afloat  
  
My buddies and their honeys all come along  
They seem invincible as they surf along  
The sea is rollin' like a thousand pound keg  
We're goin' surfin', we're goin' surfin!  
  
[Chorus: Repeat 2X]  
  
All along the undertow is strengthening it's hold  
I never thought it'd come to this  
Now I can never go home  
All along the undertow is strengthening it's hold  
I never thought it'd come to this  
Now I can never go home  
  
[Chorus]

Leave  
Me now  
Show  
Me how  
  
And I won't  
Be ashamed  
Of the things  
We once made  
And I won't be  
Comin' back 'round here no more  
Yo!  
  
Lead  
And try  
Tell  
Me why  
  
And I won't  
Let you down  
Drag your name  
All over town  
And I won't be  
Comin' back 'round here no more  
Yo!  
  
Yo everyone  
Everyone  
Everyone I know  
(Everyone I know)  
Take control  
  
Yeah  
  
And I won't  
Let you down  
Drag your name  
All over town  
And I won't be  
Comin' back 'round here no more  
Yo!  
  
Yo everyone  
Everyone  
Everyone I know  
(Everyone I know)  
Take control  
  
Whoa-oh  
Whoa-oh  
Whoa-oh

It's not my destiny to be the one that you will lay with  
So many reasons why I have to go but want to stay here  
Sometimes I want a taste but then I don't know what I'm saying  
You are the angel and I am the one who is praying  
  
There is another love that I would rather be obeying  
I see the ecstasy and already I'm anticipating  
I feel a deeper peace and that deeper peace is penetrating  
I've got the magic in me, I am complete is what I'm saying  
  
I'm flying up so high, my purple majesty displaying  
I've reached a higher place that no one else can make a claim in  
  
I'll take you there my friend  
I'm reaching out my hand, so take it  
We are the angels, and we are the ones that are praying  
  
Peace, shalom, peace, shalom  
Peace, peace  
Peace, shalom, peace, shalom  
Peace, peace

One more time  
I have crossed the line  
Now you won't be mine  
Anymore  
  
One more dream  
Vanished up in smoke  
Now I have no hope  
Anymore  
  
Let it go  
The damage in your heart  
Let it go  
The damage in your heart  
I can't tell you how you want to make me feel  
I can't tell you how you want to make me feel  
  
One more tear  
Falling down your face  
Doesn't need that much to the world  
  
One more loss  
In a losing life  
Doesn't hurt so bad  
Anymore  
  
Let it go  
The damage in your heart  
Let it go  
The damage in your heart  
I can't tell you how you want to make me feel  
I can't tell you how you want to make me feel  
  
One more tear  
Falling down your face  
Doesn't mean that much  
To the world  
  
Let it go  
The damage in your heart  
Let it go  
The damage in your heart  
I can't tell you how you want to make me feel  
I can't tell you how you want to make me feel  
I can't tell you  
I can't tell you  
I can't tell you  
How you want to make me feel

When I look in the mirror I can't believe what I see  
Tell me, who's that funky dude starin' back at me?  
  
Broken, beaten down can't even get around  
Without an old-man cane I fall and hit the ground  
Shivering in the cold, I'm bitter and alone  
  
Excuse the bitchin' - I shouldn't complain  
I should have no feeling, 'cause feeling is pain  
As everything I need is denied me  
And everything I want is taken away from me  
But who do I got to blame? Nobody but me  
  
And I don't want to be a old man anymore  
It's been a year or two since I was out on the floor  
Shakin' booty, makin' sweet love all the night  
It's time I got back to the good life  
It's time I got back, it's time I got back  
'N I don't even know how I got off the track  
I wanna go back, yeah!  
  
Screw this crap, I've had it! I ain't no Mr. Cool  
I'm a pig, I'm a dog, so 'scuse me if I drool  
I ain't gonna hurt nobody, ain't gonna cause a scene  
I just need to admit I want sugar in my tea  
Hear me? Hear me! I want sugar in my tea!  
  
And I don't want to be a old man anymore  
It's been a year or two since I was out on the floor  
Shakin' booty, makin' sweet love all the night  
It's time I got back to the good life  
It's time I got back, it's time I got back  
'N I don't even know how I got off the track  
I wanna go back, yeah!  
  
I wanna go back, I wanna go back  
And I don't even know how I got off the track  
It's time I got back, it's time I got back  
And I don't even know how I got off the track  
I want to go back, yeah!  
And I don't want to be a old man anymore  
It's been a year or two since I was out on the floor  
Shakin' booty, makin' sweet love all the night  
It's time I got back to the good life  
It's time I got back, it's time I got back  
'N I don't even know how I got off the track  
It's time I got back, it's time I got back  
'N I don't even know how I got off the track  
I wanna go back, I wanna go back!

I wan't to help you  
But I don't know how  
I wan't to soothe you  
But I can't speak out  
I have many fears  
About rejection  
I have many memories of pain  
I have always been a bit too shy  
So I'll turn and look the other way  
  
[Chorus:]  
Other way  
Other way  
I will turn and look the other way  
  
I wan't to hold you  
But I am afraid  
I want to touch you  
But I'm not that way  
I have many doubts about my motives  
I have many fears about my breed  
I have always hurt the women I love  
So I'll turn and look the other way  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I have many doubts about my motives  
I have many fears about my breed  
I have always hurt the women I love  
So I'll turn and look the other way  
  
Other way  
Other way  
I will turn and look the other way  
Other way  
Other way  
I will turn and look the other way  
Other way  
Other way  
I will turn and look the other way  
Other way  
Other way  
Other way  
Other way. (wayyyy)

There's a spider on the drain and he's feeling pain  
And he doesn't want to die any more than you or I  
He's struggling to live but he doesn't have much time  
Any more than you or I, you or I  
  
We've got to die, we've got to live  
We got to take what we can get  
We sell ourselves for petty change  
And when we die we rearrange  
It's time to take it back again  
It's time to take it back again  
I want you to love me like I love you  
  
There's nothing more for me to say  
I spoke my piece I'll go on my way  
And fare thee well where'er you go  
You might need help but I won't know  
'Cuz I'm up in here in my own cell  
It could be heaven it could be hell  
We'll never know just who we are  
'Cuz when we die we become a star  
And stars can't talk because they have  
No mouth to speak about their past  
They simply shine up in the sky  
And give their light to you and I  
And where would we be without their light  
We'd call out names and then start a fight  
But then again that's what we do  
I hate me and I hate you too  
'Cuz I'm in pain just like the spider  
In the drain, I am a fighter  
But I can't win I've got to lose  
Give me strength to see me through  
And ease the pain that I must feel  
As my bones break and I taste the steel  
As I go down...the drain...  
I'm insane

How is your heart little darling?  
I didn't mean to get so mad.  
Let me just hold you closely.  
How did things get so bad?  
I know how to pick on you.  
You pushed me over the edge.  
We caused so much agony.  
We can't seem to move ahead.  
  
This is such a pity.  
We should give all our love to each other.  
Not this hate that destroys us.  
This is such a pity.  
(This is a pity)  
  
What kind of future will we have?  
Will we we ever find peace?  
Everybody thinks we're crazy.  
They're about to call the police.  
I don't want to be a chump.  
You think I'm a fascist pig.  
Right now everything is black.  
I don't think we'll get it.  
  
This is such a pity.  
We should give all our love to each other.  
Not this hate that destroys us.  
This is such a pity.  
(This is a pity)  
  
This is such a pity.  
We should give all our love to each other.  
Not this hate that destroys us.  
This is such a pity.  
(This is a pity)

Put me in  
A special school  
'Cause I am such a fool  
And I don't need  
A single book  
To teach me how to read  
Who needs stupid books?  
They are for petty crooks  
And I will learn  
By studying  
The lesson in my dreams  
Turn off the TV  
'Cause that's what others see  
And movies are as bad as  
Eating chocolate ice cream  
They only sicken me  
Don't let me play football  
I'll sack the quarterback  
A jack the brother of the ball  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm a troublemaker  
Never been a faker  
Doing things my own way  
And never giving up  
I'm a troublemaker  
Not a double taker  
I don't have  
The patience  
To keep it on the up  
  
I picked up a guitar  
What does that signify?  
I'm gonna play  
Some heavy metal riffs  
And you will die  
You wanted arts  
And crafts  
How's this for arts  
And crafts  
...  
That's right  
I'm growing out my hair  
I'm movin' out  
To Cherokee  
I'm gonna be  
A rock star  
And you will go  
To bed with me  
'Cause I can't work a job,  
Like any other slob,  
Punch it in  
And punch it out  
And suckin' up to Bob,  
Marrying a bitch  
Having 7 kids  
Giving up  
And growing old  
And hoping  
There's a God  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm gonna be a star  
And people  
Will crane necks  
To get a glimpse of me  
And see  
If I am having a sex  
In studying  
And my moves  
They try  
To understand  
Why I am so unlike  
The singers  
In the other bands  
  
I'm such a mystery  
As anyone can see  
There isn't  
Anybody else  
Exactly quite  
Like me'  
  
And when  
It's party time  
Like 1999  
I party by myself  
Because I'm such  
A special guy  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Keep it on the up)  
I'm a troublemaker  
(Keep it on the up)  
I'm a troublemaker  
(Keep it on the up)  
I'm a troublemaker  
Never giving up
