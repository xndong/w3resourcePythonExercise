This is the place where dreams are unmade,  
Cut into pieces and left in the rain.  
They're left in the rain.  
  
This is the place where hearts come undone,  
Spill onto the sidewalk and crack in the sun.  
  
I'm boarding up my windows  
And locking all my doors,  
That's what they're for.  
It's better if it's worse than before.  
  
This is the day when promises break,  
curl up at the edges turn into mistakes.  
  
So I am smashing up my suitcase  
And sleeping on my floor,  
I'd rather be bored.  
It's better if it's worse than before.  
  
Go on, go on  
Go on, go on  
Without me  
  
Go on, go on  
Go on, go on  
Without me  
  
It's better if it's worse than before.  
It's better if it's worse than before.  
It's better if it's worse than before.  
It's better if it's worse than before.

Sometimes I think it would be better  
If you just walked away  
And stopped returning phone calls  
Come out to see the band play  
  
Lady, Leave me, I will love you more  
Sometimes I only speak when  
I'm ignored  
  
Big fish, little fish don't swim back to me  
Eww eww eww eww  
Circle my ship and slip back into the sea  
Eww eww eww eww  
I'm sending out a  
Warning 'cause I think you oughta know  
If catching you is easy then I'm gonna have to let you go  
  
Sometimes I wish you wouldn't smile  
Every time I come around  
And pick me up so easily  
Every time I let you down  
  
And baby  
Make me  
Crazy  
If you can  
  
Miscommunicate to make me  
Understand  
  
Big fish, little fish don't swim back to me  
Eww eww eww eww  
Circle my ship and slip back into the sea  
Eww eww eww eww  
I'm sending out a  
Warning 'cause I think you oughta know  
If catching you is easy then I'm gonna have to to let you go  
  
Let you go home  
I can swim like a stone again  
  
Big fish, little fish don't swim back to me  
Eww eww eww eww  
Circle my ship and slip back into the sea  
Eww eww eww eww  
Big fish, little fish don't swim back to me  
Big fish, little fish don't swim back to me  
Big fish, little fish don't swim back to me

I am stopping by to tell you  
I'll be leaving here for good,  
To go back to where I came from,  
Like you always said I should.  
I would be a liar if I said that I was fine,  
'Cause you opened up my head  
And you lost some of my mind.  
  
I've been a fool.  
I've been full of you.  
I've been lying here so long I don't know who I'm lying to.  
But I'm set on fire  
In spite of you.  
I will burn another bridge and hope the river burns up too.  
When I'm gone,  
You'll be gone too.  
  
Our hands are stained the color of the sky above our heads,  
With things we haven't done  
And words we haven't said.  
Still the pain will come as some surprise.  
When you burn a bridge the smoke gets in your eyes.  
  
No, I've been a fool.  
I've been full of you.  
I've been lying here so long I don't know who I'm lying to.  
But I'm set on fire  
In spite of you.  
I will burn another bridge and hope the river burns up too.  
When I'm gone,  
You'll be gone too.  
  
The ashes blow away,  
Trailing sheets of rain  
All along the interstate  
Somewhere into space.  
I've got no place for ashes,  
I've got no place for ashes,  
I've got no place for ashes anyway.  
  
I've been full of you.  
I've been lying here so long I don't know who I'm lying to.  
But I'm set on fire  
In spite of you.  
I will burn another bridge and hope the river burns up too.  
When I'm gone,  
When I'm gone,  
When I'm gone,  
You'll be gone too.

So we're a little bit older now.  
We're a little bit tired,  
A little bit scared of looking down.  
We wipe our weary eyes,  
And step into the storm outside.  
  
I'll be waiting,  
I'll be waiting,  
I'll be waiting for you.  
  
I'll be waiting,  
I'll be waiting,  
I'll be waiting for you now.  
I don't know where I'll end up tonight.  
Perfect pictures fade to black  
When you turn out the lights.  
  
And we're a little bit lonely now.  
We climbed a little too high,  
A little too fast,  
And we can't come down.  
And I've got two good eyes,  
But I still feel so blind sometimes.  
  
I'll be waiting,  
I'll be waiting,  
I'll be waiting for you.  
  
I'll be waiting,  
I'll be waiting,  
I'll be waiting for you now.  
I don't know where I'll end up tonight.  
Perfect pictures fade to black  
When you turn out the lights.  
When you turn out the lights...  
  
I'll be waiting,  
I'll be waiting,  
I'll be waiting for you.  
  
I'll be waiting,  
I'll be waiting,  
I'll be waiting for you.  
  
I'll be waiting,  
I'll be waiting,  
I'll be waiting for you.  
  
I'll be waiting,  
I'll be waiting,  
I'll be waiting for you.

The summer swept Chicago  
Left us with a little bit of rain  
We are trembling, glistening  
Listening to the rumble of the elevated train  
  
And I have never been afraid  
Of opening myself up to a dream  
And now you've filled me like a bubble  
And the trouble is I'm bursting at the seams  
  
I can't leave you, Carolyn  
It has never been so quiet  
My heart will never beat this loud again  
I can't leave you, Carolyn  
And walk back out amongst the strangers  
Strangers who've grown closer than my friends  
They grow closer than my friends  
  
A square of sunlight on the bedspread  
And I stagger through the silence 'til you wake  
We kiss away the morning  
Wishing that the morning lasted all day  
  
Well I have never been afraid  
Of opening myself up to a girl  
But now I've let you in  
You begin to shake my precarious world  
  
I can't leave you, Carolyn  
It has never been so quiet  
My heart will never beat this loud again  
I can't leave you, Carolyn  
I walk back out amongst the strangers  
Strangers who've grown closer than my friends  
  
Sometimes love can be so  
Sometimes love can be so lonely  
Sometimes love can be so  
Sometimes love leaves you alone  
  
(Carolyn)  
I can't leave you, (Carolyn)  
I can't leave you, (Carolyn)  
I can't leave you, (Carolyn)  
I can't leave you, (Carolyn)  
I don't ever want to be lonely, lonely (Carolyn)  
I don't ever want to be lonely, lonely (Carolyn)  
I don't ever want to be lonely, lonely (Carolyn)  
I don't ever want to be lonely, lonely (Carolyn)  
(Carolyn)  
(Carolyn)

What a difference a day makes  
Silence so delicious on days like these  
And by the time that my resolve breaks  
Well I've already found the beauty down on my knees  
You know I want to be something  
Don't ever want to be someone new  
Some people telling me one thing  
But I know if I fall I'll hold on to you  
  
There must have been an angel inside my room, yeah  
There must have been a smile somewhere in your star tattoo  
So twinkle, twinkle in your eyes the way it should  
There must have been an angel there inside my room  
  
I've got the strength for believing  
And life is so contagious in times like these  
You might say it's the season  
You lift me up if I ask you please  
Hey, Hey  
I got a heart for intentions and I  
not always sure where they gonna go  
Lead you in different direction  
I can change your life if you let me grow  
  
There must have been an angel inside my room, yeah  
There must have been a smile somewhere in your star tattoo  
So twinkle, twinkle in your eyes the way (way way) it should  
There must have been an angel there inside my room  
  
(Go, Go)  
  
(Yeah)  
  
What a difference a day makes  
Oh silence so delicious on days like these  
And by the time that my resolve breaks  
Well I've already found the beauty down on my knees  
You know I want to be something  
I never want to be someone new  
Some people telling me one thing  
But I know if I fall I'll hold on to you  
  
There must have been an angel inside my room, yeah  
There must have been a smile somewhere in your star tattoo  
So twinkle, twinkle in your eyes the way (way way) it should  
There must have been an angel there inside my room

The evening smoulders into night  
Turn up the music and I'll drive into the city lights  
The wind is on your face  
I'm blowing kisses down from outer space  
  
Baby won't you be  
Part of my fantasy  
Cause I can't sit and wait around until eventually  
So let me take you home  
And watch your garden grow  
A little closer and I'll make it so you can't say no  
  
Caress the rhythm with our feet  
We move as one and everyone around can feel the heat  
Let's take a step outside  
Cause me and you got something we should hide  
  
So baby won't you be  
Part of my fantasy  
Cause I can't sit and wait around until eventually  
Let me take you home  
And watch your garden grow  
A little closer and I'll make it so you can't say no  
  
Uh and it's making me crazy  
To be your friend when you're my fantasy  
Fantasy  
  
The morning's melting into day  
We're nose to nose and I don't think that I could turn away  
The world is in this room  
The world is in this room  
  
Baby won't you be  
Part of my fantasy  
I can't sit and wait around until eventually  
Let me take you home  
And watch your garden grow  
A little closer and I'll make it so you can't say no  
Make it so you can't say no

Hey!  
  
Well I live in this ghost town  
The whispers from the walls will fall like feathers to the ground  
And I walk upon these cemetery streets  
I don't speak the language of the skeletons I meet  
  
I live in this ghost town  
The acid in the architecture is burning the place down  
And I look out on these solitary streets  
Empty as an afterthought in purple pools of gasoline  
Purple pools of gasoline  
  
Olie olie olie ah  
The river's all in flames  
Olie olie olie ah  
I can't go home again  
Olie olie olie ah  
This city speaks in rain  
  
Well I live in this ghost town  
The coffee burns like kerosene and the color of my world is brown  
I wander through these melancholy streets  
Quiet as a photograph and lonely as my vanity  
Yeah, lonely as my vanity  
  
Olie olie olie ah  
The river's all in flames  
Olie olie olie ah  
I can't go home again  
Olie olie olie ah  
City's rearranged  
  
Heh!  
  
Olie olie olie ah  
The river's all in flames  
Olie olie olie ah  
I can't go home again  
Olie olie olie ah  
City feels so strange  
  
And I'm never gonna to leave this ghost town  
And I'm never gonna to leave this ghost town  
No I'm never gonna to leave this ghost town  
No I'm never gonna to leave the ghost town, yeah

Broken down in paradise  
I'm heavy like I'm hypnotized  
And I am sure  
The sheep are all asleep by now  
Cause I was such a fool for you  
I held my breath till I turned blue  
I loved you so much better  
When you weren't around  
  
You know I hate to say goodbye to you  
But (but) it feels like it's the only thing that I can do  
You know I hate to say goodbye to you  
But goodbye to you's the only thing it feels like I can say  
  
Absence makes the heart so fond  
Now you're back I'm paralyzed  
Been sleeping with your skeletons inside my bed  
Cause I was such a fool for you  
All those things I said were true  
I just can't seem to get those feelings back again  
  
You know I hate to say goodbye to you  
But (but) it feels like it's the only thing that I can do  
Oh you know I hate to say goodbye to you  
Oh goodbye to you's the only thing it feels like I can say

Well I flew in on a plane yesterday  
Nose pressed to the glass, I watched us come into the bay  
And then I asked myself why I left this place  
Seeking solace in a change but now it's changed my face  
And I know  
They'll say  
There's something to be said for trying out new things  
But I know  
I'll say  
Something I've been missing here along the way  
Oh yeah  
  
But there's just something 'bout coming home to California  
Yeah there's something 'bout coming home  
  
And it's so hot outside that I could fry an egg  
But I'm eating Taco Bell and gettin' high instead  
My eyes spread wide I smoke a cigarette  
Watch the sun roll by with nothing in my head  
And I know  
They'll say  
Something to be said for curiosity  
And I know  
I'll say  
I'll save my west coast dreaming for some other day  
Oh yeah  
  
Because there's something 'bout coming home to California  
Yeah there's something 'bout coming home to California  
I said there's something 'bout coming home to California  
Oh there's something 'bout coming home  
Yeah  
  
I said, I said  
There's something in the way you move  
Something in the Daily News  
And there's something in the air I breathe  
Something in the things I see  
And there's something in these orange walls  
The Northern California falls  
There's something in the clothes she wears  
And something in the way she stares at you  
  
Oh and I'm so far away from home and I need it  
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
Because there's something 'bout coming home to California  
Yeah there's something 'bout coming home to California  
Oh there's something 'bout coming home to California  
There's something 'bout going home

Every day is an endless dream  
Of traffic lights and gasoline,  
Watching as the world passes me by.  
All my friends have gone away,  
Leaving empty strangers in their place.  
The empty fills me up sometimes.  
  
I am only waiting  
For someone to break my heart.  
I am only waiting for someone.  
I've got these words that I've been saving  
For a song that I can't start,  
While I am waiting  
For someone to break my heart.  
While I am waiting  
For someone to break my heart.  
  
Every night's the same to me,  
Alcohol and scripted scenes, and looking  
For some answers I won't find.  
A hundred different shades of gray,  
A million miles and nothing seems to change.  
I ain't changed in such a long time.  
  
I am only waiting  
For someone to break my heart.  
I am only waiting for someone.  
I've got these words that I've been saving  
For a song that I can't start,  
While I am waiting  
For someone to break my heart.  
While I am waiting  
For someone to break my heart.  
  
I am only waiting  
For someone to break my heart.  
I am only waiting for someone.  
I've got these words that I've been saving  
For a song that I can't start,  
While I am waiting  
For someone to break my heart.

Wake up in the middle of the night  
And the air is so heavy  
And my head's screwed on too tight  
In the glow of the Christmas lights  
I watch you sleep  
  
And the hands on the cigarette clock are just  
Time ticking away this love I got  
There's no way to make it stop before you wake  
  
Well I know you're leaving me  
This is not the way that I  
Was brought up to believe that it would be  
Yeah I know you're leaving me  
I'm running round in circles trying to figure out  
Just who I'm supposed to be  
  
We go down to Prospect Park  
To watch the light become the dark  
And I don't think I've ever been this scared  
Outside as the double moon rises  
I know this time it won't surprise us  
But that don't mean that I will be prepared  
  
I know you're leaving me  
This is not the way that I  
Was brought up to believe that it would be  
Yeah I know you're leaving me  
I'm running round in circles trying to figure out  
Just who I'm supposed to be  
  
So tired of writing sad songs  
But my mind's on misery  
I know there's time until you're gone  
I can't let it be  
No I can't let it be  
  
I know you're leaving me  
This is not the way that I  
Was brought up to believe that it would be  
Yeah I know you're leaving me  
I'm running round in circles trying to figure out  
Just who I'm supposed to be  
Just who I'm supposed to be  
Just who I'm supposed to be  
Just who I'm supposed to be  
Oh

Give me just a little more time,  
Maybe we will  
Find the words that will change our minds.  
Oh, give me just a little more time.  
  
Give me just a little more time,  
I don't want to  
Leave the weight in this place behind.  
Oh, give me just a little more time.  
(Give me just a little more time)  
  
Ghosts white in the moonlight  
and the car breathes smoke in the middle of the night.  
All tangled up in the telephone lines and dry eyes.  
  
When you hold me close,  
Pretend like you don't want to let me go.  
And take the long way home,  
Soft as the radio.  
  
Give me just a little more time,  
Maybe we will  
Find the words that will change our minds.  
Oh, give me just a little more time.  
(Give me just a little more time)  
  
Give me just a little more time,  
I don't want to  
Leave the weight in this place behind.  
Oh, give me just a little more time.  
(Give me just a little more time)  
  
My god how scarred we are,  
To feel so little in somebody's arms.  
Smokestacks burnin' up the boulevard  
And we break apart,  
It's the easy part.  
  
Kiss me once good night.  
Your skin is glass in the dashboard lights.  
And we make up our minds,  
Two for the last time.  
  
I have never been,  
Never been somebody to hold on to.  
I have never been,  
Never been somebody to hold on to.  
I have never been,  
Never been somebody to hold on to.  
I have never been,  
Never been somebody to hold on to.  
  
But if you give me more time  
(Give me more time)  
If you could give me more time  
(Give me more time)  
  
'Cause I have never been,  
Never been somebody to hold on to.  
(Give me more time)  
I have never been,  
Never been somebody to hold on to.  
(Give me more time)  
  
I have never been,  
Never been somebody to hold on to.  
(Give me more time)

Let the color all drain out  
And won't you draw the curtain down on me  
A silence never spoke so loud  
And it's what I need  
So let me be  
With my disease  
  
And I said  
Please don't let it rain on me  
Cause I've realized I can't rely on you  
For what I need  
Yeah I said  
Please don't let it rain on me  
I ain't got no shelter from this storm  
  
On market street cars all stand still  
And this city is so beautiful tonight  
I'll drink you up to get my fill  
But I don't believe  
It's come to these  
So naturally  
  
And I said  
Please don't let it rain on me  
Because I've realized I can't rely on you  
For what I need  
Yeah I said  
Please don't let it rain on me  
Cause I ain't got no shelter from this storm  
  
And into this mind and body I was born  
And I've realized by now that I have lost control  
But I'll be okay  
Yeah I'll be okay  
  
Please don't let it rain on me  
Because I've realized I can't rely on you  
For what I need  
Yeah I said  
Please don't let it rain on me  
Cause I ain't got no shelter from this storm  
  
So rain on me  
Yeah, yeah  
So rain on me  
Yeah, yeah  
So rain on me  
Yeah, yeah  
The rain on me

Rain, rain on a Tuesday.  
The clouds are crying 'cause they can't wash me away.  
Now you've got me in your pocket,  
We fly away above the storm in your space rocket.  
  
You're my sun and I'm your satellite.  
Have me in your gravity and holding me so tight.  
You're my sun and I'm your satellite.  
And now I know how it feels  
To get it right.  
  
Naked in the afternoon.  
Bellies soaked in sweat and evening comes too soon.  
I wrap my world around your body,  
And it feels so good not to have to say I'm sorry.  
  
You're my sun and I'm your satellite.  
Have me in your gravity and holding me so tight.  
Well you're my sun and I'm your satellite.  
Now I know how it feels.  
  
And I'll keep coming right back to you now,  
I'll keep coming right back to you now, yes I will.  
And I'll keep coming right back to you now,  
But will you keep standing still?  
  
You're my sun and I'm your satellite.  
Have me in your gravity and holding me so tight.  
You're my sun and I'm your satellite.  
Now I know how it feels  
To get it right.

You laid your cards down on the table,  
And all your hearts have turned to spades.  
'Cause the sun ain't been seen  
Since the last time you came clean.  
I'm getting tired of so much gray.  
  
Don't you know me better than that?  
Don't you know I know you?  
Giving your words and then taking them back,  
Can't you see you're see through?  
  
Please stop saying there ain't nothing wrong.  
You can cover your eyes and you'll still hear lies.  
Please stop saying there ain't nothing wrong.  
And you can cover your ears but I won't disappear. (no, no)  
  
Baby you're brimming with disaster,  
Your words spill onto the floor.  
And the only thing that's clear  
Is you're being insincere.  
So I'm not listening anymore.  
  
Don't you know me better than that?  
Don't you know I know you?  
Giving your words and then taking them back,  
Can't you see I see straight through you.  
  
Please stop saying there ain't nothing wrong.  
If you could cover your eyes but you'll still hear lies.  
Please stop saying there ain't nothing wrong.  
If you could cover your ears but I won't disappear. (no, no)  
  
Please stop saying there ain't nothing wrong.  
You could cover your eyes but I'll still hear lies.  
Please stop saying there ain't nothing wrong.  
You could cover your ears but I won't disappear. (no, no)  
  
Please stop saying there ain't nothing wrong.  
You can cover your eyes but you'll still hear lies.  
Please stop saying there ain't nothing wrong.  
You could cover your ears but I won't disappear at all.  
  
Stop speaking if you know I don't hear you.  
Stop speaking if you know I don't hear you.  
Stop speaking if you know I don't hear you.  
Cover your eyes and you won't hear lies.  
Stop speaking if you know I don't hear you.  
Stop speaking if you know I don't hear you.  
Stop speaking if you know I don't hear you.  
Cover your ears so you won't disappear.

Lying on my back I feel you breathing  
Sucking down the ghosts into your sleep  
There's something in your spine that makes me nervous  
Black that swells between us grows more deep  
Cut the world in chords  
Making melodies from words  
And I'm confused again  
Take all this abuse cause I ain't got much to lose  
  
It's a starry starry night out here on hope street  
But hope gives way to hunger when you're poor  
With pockets full of promises and poems  
I know that you ain't worth much anymore  
Spoke in broken time  
Twisted rhythms, crooked rhymes  
And I'm confused again  
Paint my world in blue  
Cause I've never liked to lose  
  
I don't think I want to spend another night with you  
I don't think I want to spend another day  
Feeling the way you leave me to  
I don't think I want to spend another night with you  
I don't think I want to spend another day  
Feeling the way you leave me to  
  
Standing in the half light of the morning  
I watch the shadows lace across my shoes  
There's something in your voice that makes me nervous  
If I can tell we're lying, why can't you?  
The song that's in my head  
Is playing backwards in this bed  
And I'm confused again  
Seems like I have to choose  
It feels like either way I lose  
  
Cause I don't think I want to spend another night with you  
Well I don't think I want to spend another day  
Feeling the way you leave me to  
I don't think I want to spend another night with you  
I don't think I want to spend another day  
Feeling the way you leave me to  
  
Spoke in broken time  
Crooked rhythms, twisted rhymes  
And I'm confused again  
Either way I choose  
I know I'm gonna lose  
  
I don't think I want to spend another night with you  
I don't think I want to spend another day  
Feeling the way you leave me to  
I don't think I want to spend another night with you  
I don't think I want to spend another day  
Feeling the way you leave me to  
(I don't think I want to spend another night with you)  
Feeling the way you leave me to  
(I don't think I want to spend another night with you)  
Feeling the way you leave me to  
(I don't think I want to spend another night with you)  
Feeling the way you leave me to  
(I don't think I want to spend another night with you)  
Come On!

All I want to do is write a stupid song  
With a three line chorus, you can sing along  
And if it feels so good until it's gone  
Will you love me?  
  
Look at me  
Tell me I'm a loser  
A simple-minded microphone abuser that is me  
And I guess I know the reason why you hate me  
But I won't let your condescension break me, so sorry  
  
Yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah  
  
Cause all I want to do is write a stupid song  
With a three line chorus, you can sing along  
And if it feels so good until it's gone  
Will you love me?  
  
All I want to make is a melody  
The kind that sticks down in your memory  
And if it feeds our rock n' roll fantasies  
Will you love me?  
  
Cause music ain't some kind of competition  
And if you don't like me  
You don't have to listen to my songs  
You said this band ain't shit until you're wasted  
Pour another drink for me  
  
All I want to do is write a stupid song

Yeah!

It's Friday night  
I'm tired of searching for this life  
The week's been cruel to me  
I just want to feel alright  
And all over town the word's been going around  
Where I want to be  
Is wherever you'll be found  
  
Mmm Hmm  
And now it takes up nearly all of my time  
Oh and I need  
I need some way  
I need some way to get you off my mind  
  
Oh cause sometimes when you get close to me  
It brings me close to heaven  
But I can't get in  
Ah No no no  
And the more you shy away from me  
To search for something better  
It hurts me slow  
And I don't know  
'Cause I'm the squid  
  
And now all this time I wait for you to realize  
I'll treat you lovingly  
Oh open up your eyes  
And once again I say I need you my friend  
Touch your lips to me  
I'll be your cigarette  
Yeah  
  
You know I love you so  
But I don't know  
And I won't know  
Exactly where we're gonna go  
Gonna go, no  
  
'Cause sometimes when you get close to me  
It brings me close to heaven  
But I can't get in  
Ah no no no  
And the more you shy away from me  
To search for something better  
It hurts me slow  
I still don't know  
'Cause I'm the squid

Drive into the sky until  
It turns the afternoon black  
Halfway across the state on the day  
We set the clocks back, yeah  
And I don't know where I'm going  
I follow broken yellow lines  
And I hope this open road  
Could read my broken mind  
  
This wouldn't be the first day  
You left me thirsty  
This wouldn't be the first day  
You went your way, left me empty, dry  
  
Living in the dark and it's  
Turned your heart black  
Halfway to the moon since you  
Took your nights back  
Well I was finished being cool  
I'd unmasked this masquerade  
And you leave me here to clean up  
All this mess you've made?  
  
This wouldn't be the first day  
You left me thirsty  
This wouldn't be the first day you  
Went your way and left me empty  
  
This wouldn't be the first day  
You left me thirsty  
This wouldn't be the first day you  
Went your way, left me empty, dry  
  
This wouldn't be the first day  
You left me thirsty  
This wouldn't be the first day you  
Went your way, left me empty, dry
