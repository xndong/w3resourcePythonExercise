The phone don't ring  
And the sun refused to shine  
Never thought I'd have to pay so dearly  
For what was already mine  
For such a long, long time  
  
We made mad love  
Shadow love  
Random love  
And abandoned love  
Accidentally like a martyr  
The hurt gets worse and the heart gets harder  
  
The days slide by  
Should have done, should have done, we all sigh  
Never thought I'd ever be so lonely  
After such a long, long time  
Time out of mind  
  
We made mad love  
Shadow love  
Random love  
And abandoned love  
Accidentally like a martyr  
The hurt gets worse and the heart gets harder

Well, I've seen all there is to see  
And I've heard all they have to say  
I've done everything I wanted to do . . .  
I've done that too  
And it ain't that pretty at all  
Ain't that pretty at all  
So I'm going to hurl myself against the wall  
'Cause I'd rather feel bad than not feel anything at all  
You know, I just had a short vacation, Roy  
Spent it getting a root canal  
"Oh, how'd you like it?"  
Well, it ain't that pretty at all  
So I'm going to hurl myself against the wall  
'Cause I'd rather feel bad than not feel anything at all  
Gonna get a good running start and throw myself at the wall as hard as I can
man  
I've been to Paris  
And it ain't that pretty at all  
I've been to Rome  
Guess what?  
I'd like to go back to Paris someday and visit the Louvre Museum  
Get a good running start and hurl myself at the wall  
Going to hurl myself against the wall  
'Cause I'd rather feel bad than feel nothing at all  
And it ain't that pretty at all  
Ain't that pretty at all

It used to seem to me  
That my life ran on too fast  
And I had to take it slowly  
Just to make the good parts last  
But when you're born to run  
It's so hard to just slow down  
So don't be surprised to see me  
Back in that bright part of town  
  
I'll be back in the high life again  
All the doors I closed one time will open up again  
I'll be back in the high life again  
All the eyes that watched me once will smile and take me in  
And I'll drink and dance with one hand free  
Let the world back into me  
And on I'll be a sight to see  
Back in the high life again  
  
You used to be the best  
To make life be life to me  
And I hope that you're still out there  
And you're like you used to be  
We'll have ourselves a time  
And we'll dance 'til the morning sun  
And we'll let the good times come in  
And we won't stop 'til we're done  
  
We'll be back in the high life again  
All the doors I closed one time will open up again  
We'll be back in the high life again  
All the eyes that watched us once will smile and take us in  
And we'll drink and dance with one hand free  
And have the world so easily  
And oh we'll be a sight to see  
Back in the high life again  
  
We'll be back in the high life again  
All the doors I closed one time will open up again  
We'll be back in the high life again  
All the eyes that watched us once will smile and take us in  
And we'll drink and dance with one hand free  
And have the world so easily  
And oh we'll be a sight to see  
Back in the high life again

I was caught between the years  
Cost me nearly all my tears  
With my back turned looking down the path  
  
Hit me like a ton of bricks  
Had to have my outlook fixed  
With my back turned looking down the path  
  
People always ask me why  
What's the matter with me?  
Nothing matters when I'm with my ba-a-by  
With my back turned looking down the path  
  
We'll go walkin' hand in hand  
Laughin' fit to beat the band  
With our backs turned looking down the path  
  
People always ask me why  
What's the matter with me?  
Nothing matters when I'm with my ba-a-by  
With my back turned looking down the path  
  
Some may have and some may not  
God, I'm thankful for what I got  
With my back turned, looking down the path  
With my back turned, looking down the path  
With my back turned, looking down the path

Was it something I did  
In another life?  
I try and try  
But nothing comes out right  
For me  
Bad Karma  
  
Killing me by degrees  
I took a wrong turn  
On the astral plane  
Now I keep on thinkin'  
My luck is gonna change  
Someday  
Bad Karma  
  
It's uphill all the way  
I can't run, Can't hide  
Can't get away  
It must be my destiny  
The same thing happens to me every day  
Bad Karma  
  
Coming after me  
Bad Karma  
Killing me by degrees  
Bad Karma  
Bad Karma  
  
It's a dog's life  
And it's not my fault  
Ought to hang my picture  
In the All-Time Losers'  
Hall of Fame  
Bad Karma  
  
It's a low-down dirty shame  
I can't run, Can't hide  
Can't get away  
It must be my destiny  
The same thing happens to me every day  
Bad Karma  
  
Coming after me  
Bad Karma  
Killing me by degrees  
Bad Karma  
Bad Karma

My baby is a basket case  
A bipolar mama in leather and lace  
Face like an angel, she's a perfect waste  
My baby is a basket case  
  
Dracula's daughter, Calamity Jane  
Smoke on the water, water on the brain  
She's pretty as a picture, and totally crazed  
My baby is a basket case  
  
She's gonna make a madman outta me  
She's gonna make a madman outta me  
  
She's manic-depressive and schizoid, too  
The friskiest psycho that I ever knew  
We're paranoid lovers lost in space  
My baby is a basket case  
  
My baby's gonna celebrate  
I'm being dragged through the nuthouse gates  
Got my straitjacket on and I'm taking her place  
My baby is a basket case  
  
She finally made a madman outta me  
She finally made a madman outta me  
My baby made a madman outta me  
She finally made a madman outta me

I hear Mariachi static on my radio  
And the tubes they glow in the dark  
And I'm there with her in Ensenada  
And I'm here in Echo Park  
  
Carmelita hold me tighter  
I think I'm sinking down  
And I'm all strung out on heroin  
On the outskirts of town  
  
Well, I'm sittin' here playing solitaire  
With my pearl-handled deck  
The county won't give me no more methadone  
And they cut off your welfare check  
  
Carmelita hold me tighter  
I think I'm sinking down  
And I'm all strung out on heroin  
On the outskirts of town  
  
Well, I pawned my Smith Corona  
And I went to meet my man  
He hangs out down on Alvarado Street  
By the Pioneer chicken stand  
  
Carmelita hold me tighter  
I think I'm sinking down  
And I'm all strung out on heroin  
On the outskirts of town  
  
Carmelita hold me tighter  
I think I'm sinking down  
And I'm all strung out on heroin

I like to think I've earned my reputation  
For rushing in where angels fear to tread  
I'll take you home to meet the congregation  
We'll all get together in my tent  
I make a dirty little religion out of lovin'  
I'll make a dirty little convert out of you  
I make a dirty little religion out of lovin'  
I'll make a dirty little convert out of you  
They treat you like a red-headed stepchild  
And try to keep you nailed to the floor  
Join us for the countdown to the Rapture  
We never turned a sinner from our door  
I make a dirty little religion out of lovin'  
I'll make a dirty little convert out of you  
I make a dirty little religion out of lovin'  
It's a dirty little religion, hallelujah  
Dirty little acolyte  
Dirty little one  
Learn the fundamentals of desire  
Can I get a witness  
To my testament?  
Can I get an amen from the choir?  
I like to think I've earned my reputation  
For trying to take the bull by the horns  
I'll show you where I get my inspiration  
Where we plow and where we plant the corn  
I make a dirty little religion out of lovin'  
I'll make a dirty little convert out of you  
I make a dirty little religion out of lovin'  
It's a dirty little religion, hallelujah

Dirty little one  
You'll learn the fundamentals of desire  
Can I get a witness  
To my testament?  
Can I get an amen from the choir?  
  
  
  

Disorder in the house  
The tub runneth over  
Plaster's falling down in pieces by the couch of pain  
  
Disorder in the house  
Time to duck and cover  
Helicopters hover over rough terrain  
  
Disorder in the house  
Reptile wisdom  
Zombies on the lawn staggering around  
  
Disorder in the house  
There's a flaw in the system  
And the fly in the ointment's gonna bring the whole thing down  
  
The floodgates are open  
We've let the demons loose  
The big guns have spoken  
And we've fallen for the ruse  
  
Disorder in the house  
It's a fate worse than fame  
Even the Lhasa Apso seems to be ashamed  
  
Disorder in the house  
The doors are coming off the hinges  
The earth will open and swallow up the real estate  
  
I just got my paycheck  
I'm gonna paint the whole town grey  
Whether it's a night in Paris or a Fresno matinee  
  
It's the home of the brave and the land of the free  
Where the less you know the better off you'll be  
  
Disorder in the house  
All bets are off  
I'm sprawled across the davenport of despair  
  
Disorder in the house  
I'll live with the losses  
And watch the sundown through the portiere

On a small Missouri farm  
Back when the west was young  
Two boys learned to rope and ride  
And be handy with a gun  
War broke out between the states  
And they joined up with Quantrill  
And it was over in Clay county  
That Frank and Jesse finally learned to kill  
Keep on riding, riding, riding  
Frank and Jesse James  
Keep on riding, riding, riding  
'Til you clear your names  
Keep on riding, riding, riding  
Across the rivers and the range  
Keep on riding, riding, riding Frank and Jesse James  
After Appomattox they were on the loosing side  
So no amnesty was granted  
And as outlaws they did ride  
They rode against the railroads,  
And they rode against the banks  
And they rode against the governor  
Never did they ask for a word of thanks  
Keep on riding, riding, riding  
Frank and Jesse James  
Keep on riding, riding, riding  
'Til you clear your names  
Keep on riding, riding, riding  
Across the prairies and the plains  
Keep on riding, riding, riding  
Frank and Jesse James  
Robert Ford, a gunman  
Did exchange for his parole  
Took the life of James the outlaw  
Which he snuck up on and stole  
No one knows just where they came to be misunderstood  
But the poor Missouri farmers knew  
Frank and Jesse do the best they could  
Keep on riding, riding, riding  
Frank and Jesse James  
Keep on riding, riding, riding  
'Til you clear your names  
Keep on riding, riding, riding  
Across the rivers and the range  
Keep on riding, riding, riding  
Frank and Jesse James

Softly falls the morning rain  
Loneliness comes around again  
And I sit and sing my song  
'Though it never seems to matter  
And it never fills the emptiness inside  
Frozen notes hang suspended in the autumn air  
While someone waits for someone to come somewhere  
No one waits for me  
'Cause I thought I wanted to be free  
Now I'm wondering why I said goodbye  
Looking through my window  
At the dark and troubled sky  
I think I see the ship of the brokenhearted passing by  
And I turn away  
From today  
To where we used to lie  
And I cry  
Yes, I cry  
And I cry  
While softly falls the morning rain  
Loneliness comes around again  
  
  

Big gorilla at the L.A. Zoo  
Snatched the glasses right off my face  
Took the keys to my BMW  
Left me here to take his place  
  
I wish the ape a lot of success  
I'm sorry my apartment's a mess  
Most of all I'm sorry if I made you blue  
I'm betting the gorilla will, too  
  
They say Jesus will find you wherever you go  
But when He'll come looking for you, they don't know  
In the mean time, keep your profile low  
Gorilla, you're a desperado  
  
He built a house on an acre of land  
He called it 'Villa Gorilla Now'  
I hear he's getting divorced  
Laying low at L'Ermitage, of course  
  
Then the ape grew very depressed  
Went through Transactional Analysis  
He plays racquetball and runs in the rain  
Still he's shackled to a platinum chain  
  
Big gorilla at the L.A. Zoo  
Snatched the glasses right off my face  
Took the keys to my BMW  
Left me here to take his place

She tells him she thinks she needs to be free  
He tells her he doesn't understand  
She takes his hand  
She tells him nothing's working out the way they planned  
  
She's so many women  
He can't find the one who was his friend  
So he's hanging on to half her heart  
He can't have the restless part  
So he tells her to hasten down the wind  
  
Then he agrees he thinks she needs to be free  
Then she says she'd rather be with him  
But it's just a whim  
By which she hopes to keep him on the limb  
  
She's so many women  
He can't find the one who was his friend  
So he's hanging on to half her heart  
He can't have the restless part  
So he tells her to hasten down the wind

When I was young  
The sky was filled with stars  
I watched them burn out one by one  
I've had my share  
Of disappointing love affairs  
And I'm no stranger to disillusionment  
Little darlin'  
If you need a helping hand  
If you need someone  
You can count on me  
And I will understand  
  
[Chorus]  
Heartache spoken here  
I know a thing or two about heartbreak and tears  
So come on down, we'll talk about it  
Heartache spoken here  
Heartache spoken here  
I know a thing or two about heartbreak and tears  
So come on down we'll talk about it  
Heartache spoken here  
  
A house of cards  
A castle made of sand  
Don't take much to blow away  
Rows and rows  
Of broken hearts and broken homes  
So much sadness, you see it every day  
Little darlin' If you need a helping hand  
If you need someone  
You can count on me  
And I will understand  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I know it hurts so  
When the one you love don't need you  
I know the sorrow  
That a reckless heart can lead to  
  
[Chorus]

I can see me bound and gagged  
Dragged behind the clownmobile  
You can treat me like a dog  
If you make me feel what others feel  
You can train me, you can drain me  
If you make me lose control  
I will be your prisoner  
I will be your hostage-o  
I will be your prisoner  
I will be your hostage-o  
All you have to do is ask  
I'll be happy to say yes  
I'll put on the creepy mask  
If you'll grant me some forgetfulness  
You can strain me, you can maim me  
You can chain me to the floor  
I will be your prisoner  
I will be your hostage-o  
I will be your prisoner  
I will be your hostage-o  
And this loneliness--  
Unbearable  
And it all goes by so slow  
I will stand in line  
For the sacrifice  
For the shamefaced love  
Of the ugly vice  
I will pay the price to see how far you'll go  
Let me be your prisoner  
Let me be your hostage-o  
I can see me bound and gagged  
Dragged behind the clownmobile  
You can treat me like a dog  
If you make me feel what others feel  
You can sprain me, you can blame me  
If you make me lose control  
I will be your prisoner  
I will be your hostage-o  
I will be your prisoner  
I will be your hostage-o  
  

This time I have to leave  
It's all to clear  
It's plain to see  
No use in hanging round  
Like a dog that whines and cries  
This time I have to leave  
  
Did you hear that I'm attached  
I'm on a dead end path  
Can't you see it hurts me so  
But I really got to go  
This time I have to leave  
  
Well, I'm gonna disappear  
Stayed too long, I'll shake my tears  
You gave your all we weren't shy  
So thanks again it's been nice  
But this time I have to leave  
It's all too clear  
It's plain to see  
No use in hanging round  
They tell me I'm outta bounds  
This time I have to leave  
  
Well, it looks as though I'll be gone for awhile  
So try not to get too riled  
There'll be another time  
When we can unwind  
But I got to get it on down the line  
  
This time I have to leave  
It's all too clear  
It's plain to see  
No use in hanging round  
You'll get by somehow  
This time I have to leave  
  
But love won't go away  
I feel I've got to stay  
And go on living a lie  
With you I know there's no goodbye  
This time I have to leave  
It's all too clear  
It's plain to see  
No use in hanging round  
After all, anyway, anyhow  
This time I have to leave

I had the shit till it all got smoked  
I kept the promise till the vow got broke  
I had to drink from the lovin' cup  
I stood on the banks till the river rose up  
I saw the bride in her wedding gown  
I was in the house when the house burned down  
I may be old and I may be bent  
But I had the money till it all got spent  
I had the money till they made me pay  
Then I had the sense to be on my way  
I had to stay in the underground  
I was in the house when the house burned down  
I was in the house when the house burned down  
I met the man with the thorny crown  
I helped Him carry his cross through town  
I was in the house when the house burned down  
I was in the house when the house burned down  
I met the man with the thorny crown  
I helped Him carry his cross through town  
I was in the house when the house burned down

I kept the promise till the vow got broke

Sweet silver angels over the sea  
Please come down flying low for me  
  
One time I trusted a stranger  
'Cause I heard his sweet song  
It was gently enticing me  
But there was something wrong  
And when I turned  
He was gone  
Blinding me  
His song remains reminding me  
He's a bandit and a heartbreaker  
My Jesus was a cross maker  
  
Sweet silver angels over the sea  
Please come down flying low for me  
  
He wages war with the devil  
With a pistol by His side  
He's always chasing him out of windows  
And He won't give him a place to hide  
But he keeps His door  
Open wide  
Fighting him  
He lights a lamp inviting him  
He's a bandit and a heartbreaker  
My Jesus was a cross maker  
Yeah, Jesus was a cross maker  
  
I heard the thunder come rumblin'  
The light never looked so dim  
I see the junction get nearer  
And danger is in the wind  
And either road's lookin' grim  
  
Hidin' me, I flee, desire dividin' me  
He's a bandit and a heartbreaker.  
Oh, but Jesus was a cross maker  
Yes, Jesus was a cross maker

Lear jet S.W.A.T team  
On a midnight run  
With the M16  
And the Ingram gun  
We parachute in  
We parachute out  
"Death from above"  
We're screaming now  
  
Where the pay is good  
And the risk is high  
It's understood  
We'll do or die  
Stun gun in hand  
Where the gun is law  
From Ovamboland  
To Nicaragua  
Strength and muscle and jungle work.  
  
Three young men  
In a Russian truck  
With a little MAC-10  
Sent 'em running to the huts  
These few young men  
The few who dare  
To battle in Hell  
Le Mercenaire!  
Strength and muscle and jungle work.

Shadows are fallin' and I'm runnin' out of breath  
Keep me in your heart for a while  
If I leave you it doesn't mean I love you any less  
Keep me in your heart for a while  
  
When you get up in the mornin' and you see that crazy sun  
Keep me in your heart for a while  
There's a train leavin' nightly called "When All is Said and Done"  
Keep me in your heart for a while  
  
Sha-lalala-lala-li-lalala-lo  
Keep me in your heart for a while  
Sha-lalala-lala-li-lalala-lo  
Keep me in your heart for a while  
  
Sometimes when you're doin' simple things around the house  
Maybe you'll think of me and smile  
You know I'm tied to you like the buttons on your blouse  
Keep me in your heart for a while  
  
Hold me in your thoughts  
Take me to your dreams  
Touch me as I fall into view  
When the winter comes  
Keep the fires lit  
And I will be right next to you  
  
Engine driver's headed north up to Pleasant Stream  
Keep me in your heart for a while  
These wheels keep turnin' but they're runnin' out of steam  
Keep me in your heart for a while  
  
Sha-lalala-lala-li-lalala-lo  
Keep me in your heart for a while  
Sha-lalala-lala-li-lalala-lo  
Keep me in your heart for a while  
  
Keep me in your heart for a while

I went home with a waitress the way I always do  
How was I to know she was with the Russians, too?  
  
I was gambling in Havana - I took a little risk  
Send lawyers, guns, and money  
Dad, get me out of this  
  
An innocent bystander  
Somehow I got stuck between a rock and a hard place  
And I'm down on my luck  
Yes, I'm down on my luck  
Well, I'm down on my luck  
  
I'm hiding in Honduras - I'm a desperate man  
Send lawyers, guns, and money  
The shit has hit the fan  
  
Send lawyers, guns, and money...

When my Mama met my girl, she took me aside  
She's a soft-spoken woman but she speaks her mind  
She said "De de de de de de de de de de"  
Let nothing come between you  
De de de de de de de de de de  
Don't let nothing come between you"  
I went to see my friend to ask his advice  
He just smiled and, "She's good around the eyes."  
But I'd already made up my mind  
Let nothing come between us  
  
There are frustrated people in town  
Who might envy us and try to bring us down  
We know they don't really mean any harm  
That doesn't mean we've gotta let 'em hang around  
  
Got the license - got the ring  
Got back the blood tests and everything  
Putting on my boutonniere - It's her favorite flower  
Then I'm walking down the altar and I'm gonna take the vow  
De de de de de de de de de de  
Don't let nothing come between us  
De de de de de de de de de de  
Don't let nothing come between us  
  
There are frustrated people in town  
Who might envy us and try to bring us down  
We know they don't really mean any harm  
That doesn't mean we've gotta let 'em hang around  
  
I have advice for the young and old  
If I may be so bold  
When you find someone to have and hold  
Don't let nothing come between you  
De de de de de de de de de de  
Get together and let nothing come between us  
De de de de de de de de de de  
Get together and let nothing come between us

You've got an invalid haircut  
It hurts when you smile  
You'd better get out of town  
Before your nickname expires  
It's the kingdom of the spiders  
It's the empire of the ants  
You need a permit to walk around downtown  
You need a license to dance  
Life'll kill ya  
That's what I said  
Life'll kill ya  
Then you'll be dead  
Life'll find ya  
Wherever you go  
Requiescat in pace  
That's all she wrote  
From the President of the United States  
To the lowliest rock and roll star  
The doctor is in and he'll see you now  
He don't care who you are  
Some get the awful, awful diseases  
Some get the knife, some get the gun  
Some get to die in their sleep  
At the age of a hundred and one  
Life'll kill ya  
That's what I said  
Life'll kill ya  
Then you'll be dead  
Life'll find ya  
Wherever you go  
Requiescat in pace  
That's all she wrote  
Maybe you'll go to heaven  
See Uncle Al and Uncle Lou  
Maybe you'll be reincarnated  
Maybe that stuff's true  
If you were good  
Maybe you'll come back as someone nice  
And if you were bad  
Maybe you'll have to pay the price  
Life'll kill ya  
That's what I said  
Life'll kill ya  
Then you'll be dead  
Life'll find ya  
Wherever you go  
Requiescat in pace  
That's all she wrote  
  

I worked hard, but not for the money  
Did my best to please  
I used to think it was funny  
'Til I realized it was just a tease  
Don Quixote had his windmills  
Ponce de Leon took his cruise  
Took Sinbad seven voyages  
To see that it was all a ruse  
(That's why I'm) Looking for the next best thing  
Looking for the next best thing  
I appreciate the best  
But I'm settling for less  
'Cause I'm looking for the next best thing  
Looking for the next best thing  
All alone on the road to perfection  
At the inspection booth they tried to discourage me  
You can believe what you want--that'll never change it  
You'll have to come around eventually  
(And you'll be) Looking for the next best thing  
Looking for the next best thing  
I appreciate the best  
But I'm settling for less  
'Cause I'm looking for the next best thing  
Looking for the next best thing  
I'm looking for the next best thing  

Lord Byron had a lot of luggage  
He took it when he traveled far and wide  
He didn't get to bathe very often  
Be he liked to change his clothes all the time  
  
I had a little friend named Mister Johnson  
Who always tried to be like me  
He rose to the heights of this profession  
He was hard on his friends and family  
  
Still out here in the wind and rain  
Look a little older but I feel no pain  
And it stands to reason  
I'm still looking for love  
  
I went to the Henley Regatta  
Intending to put out to sea  
They pronounced me persona non grata  
Goes to show that you can't come and go as you please  
  
Still out here in the wind and rain  
Look a little older but I feel no pain  
And it stands to reason  
I'm still looking for love  
  
Looking for a needle in a haystack  
It's pretty hard to find  
Every dog has his day, Jack  
I'm still waiting for mine  
  
Still out here in the wind and rain  
A whole lot older but I feel no pain  
And it stands to reason  
I'm still looking for love

Gambler ambled down a country lane  
Looking for a game of chance  
She was twenty-one or two  
And she knew what she wanted  
And she wanted that gamblin' man  
  
Her parents warned her  
Tried to reason with her  
She was determined that she wanted Bill  
They'd all be offended at the mention still  
If they heard this song, which I doubt they will  
  
And my Mama couldn't be persuaded  
When they pleaded with her  
"Daughter don't marry that gamblin' man."  
Mama couldn't be persuaded  
When they pleaded with her  
"Daughter don't marry that gamblin' man."  
Mama couldn't be persuaded  
When they pleaded with her  
No, no, nevertheless  
I said my Mama couldn't be persuaded  
When they pleaded with her  
"Daughter, don't marry that gamblin' man."  
  
Gambler tried to be a family man  
Though it didn't suit his style  
He thought he had him a winning combination  
So he took us where the stakes were high  
Her parents warned her  
Tried to reason with her  
Never kept their disappointment hid  
They all went to pieces when the bad luck hit  
Stuck in the middle, I was the kid  
  
And my Mama couldn't be persuaded  
When they pleaded with her  
"Daughter don't marry that gamblin' man."  
Mama couldn't be persuaded  
When they pleaded with her  
"Daughter don't marry that gamblin' man."  
Mama couldn't be persuaded  
When they pleaded with her  
No, no, nevertheless  
M-m-m-m-m-mama couldn't be persuaded  
When my Grannie pleaded with her  
Not to marry that gamblin' man.  
  
I said my mama couldn't be persuaded  
When they pleaded with her  
"Daughter don't marry that gamblin' man."  
Mama couldn't be persuaded  
When they pleaded with her  
"Daughter don't marry that gamblin' man."  
Mama  
M-m-m-Mama couldn't be persuaded when they pleaded with her  
"Daughter don't marry that gamblin' man."

Hell is only half full  
Room for you and me  
Looking for a new fool  
Who's it gonna be?  
It's the Dance of Shiva  
It's the Debutantes ball  
And everyone will be there  
Who's anyone at all  
Monkey wash donkey rinse  
Going to a party in the center of the earth  
Monkey wash donkey rinse  
Honey, don't you want to go?  
Monkey wash donkey rinse  
Going to a party in the center of the earth  
Monkey wash donkey rinse  
Honey, don't you want to go?  
Left eye, right eye  
Take a look around  
Everybody's heading  
For a hole in the ground  
And it's the Dance of Shiva  
It's the Twilight of the Gods  
Thunder and lightning  
'Til the break of dawn

I started as an altar boy working at the church  
Learning all my holy moves doing some research  
Which led me to a cash box labelled "Children's Fund"  
I'd leave the change and tuck the bills inside my cummerbund  
I got a part-time job at my father's carpet store  
Laying tactless stripping and housewives by the score  
I loaded up their furniture and took it to Spokane  
Auctioned off every last Naugahyde divan  
I'm very well acquainted with the seven deadly sins  
I keep a busy schedule trying to fit them in  
I'm proud to be a glutton and I don't have time for sloth  
I'm greedy and I'm angry and I don't care who I cross  
[CHORUS]  
I'm, intruder in the dirt  
I like to have a good time and I don't care who gets hurt  
I'm, take a look at me  
I'll live to be a hundred and go down in history  
Of course I went to law school and got a law degree  
And counseled all my clients to plead insanity  
Then worked in hair replacement swindling the bald  
Where very few are chosen, fewer still are called  
Then on to Monte Carlo play chemin de fer  
I threw away the fortune I made transplanting hair  
I put my last few francs down on a prostitute  
Who took me up to her room to perform the flag salute  
Whereupon I stole her passport and her wig  
And headed for the airport and the midnight flight, you dig?  
Fourteen hours later I was down in Adelaide  
Looking through the want ads sipping Foster's in the shade  
I opened up an agency somewhere down the line  
To hire aboriginals to work the opal mines  
But I attached their wages and took a whopping cut  
And whisked away their workman's comp and pauperized the lot  
[CHORUS]  
I bought a first class ticket on Malaysian Air  
Landed in Sri Lanka none the worse for wear  
I'm thinking of retiring from all my dirty deals  
See you in the next life, wake me up for meals

Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum  
Hoist the mainsail, here I come  
Ain't no room on board for the insincere  
You're my witness  
I'm your mutineer  
  
I was born to rock the boat  
Some may sink but we will float  
Grab your coat, let's get out of here  
You're my witness  
I'm your mutineer  
  
Long ago we laughed at shadows  
Lightning flashed and thunder followed us  
It could never find us here  
You're my witness  
I'm your mutineer  
  
Long ago we laughed at shadows  
Lightning flashed and thunder followed us  
It could never find us here  
You're my witness  
I'm your mutineer  
  
I was born to rock the boat  
Some may sink but we will float  
Grab your coat, let's get out of here

You're my witness

I was staying at the Marriott  
With Jesus and John Wayne  
I was waiting for a chariot  
They were waiting for a train  
  
The sky was full of carrion  
"I'll take the mazuma"  
Said Jesus to Marion  
"That's the 3:10 to Yuma  
My ride's here..."  
  
The Houston sky was changeless  
We galloped through bluebonnets  
I was wrestling with an angel  
You were working on a sonnet  
  
You said, "I believe the seraphim  
Will gather up my pinto  
And carry us away, Jim  
Across the San Jacinto  
My ride's here..."  
  
Shelley and Keats were out in the street  
And even Lord Byron was leaving for Greece  
While back at the Hilton, last but not least  
Milton was holding his sides  
  
Saying, "You bravos had better be ready to fight  
Or we'll never get out of East Texas tonight  
The trail is long and the river is wide  
And my ride's here"  
  
I was staying at the Westin  
I was playing to a draw  
When in walked Charlton Heston  
With the Tablets of the Law  
  
He said, "It's still the Greatest Story"  
I said, "Man I'd like to stay  
But I'm bound for glory  
I'm on my way  
My ride's here..."

There's a way to live that's right for us  
Like Mayans in Manhattan and Los Angeles  
I'm scaling up, I'm breaking down  
And I'm doing lunch all over town

We left Constantinople in a thousand ninety-nine  
To restore the one True Cross was in this heart of mine  
To bring it to Jerusalem and then sail home to Rhodes  
We took that holy ride ourselves to know  
We took that holy ride ourselves to know  
Everyone got famous, everyone got rich  
Everyone went off the rails and ended in the ditch  
But we had to take that long, hard road to see where it would go  
We took that holy ride ourselves to know  
We took that holy ride ourselves to know  
Now if you make a pilgrimage I hope you find your grail  
Be loyal to the ones you leave with even if you fail  
Be chivalrous to strangers you meet along the road  
As you take that holy ride yourselves to know  
You take that holy ride yourselves to know

They say the devil's in the details  
I know what they mean  
I'm walking in the wasteland  
With the Ghost in the Machine  
There's a simulated sunset  
Starlight in my eyes  
The skies are filled with miracles  
And half of them are lies  
Are you real or not?  
It's a fine line  
Are you ready or not  
For the light of day  
Are you real or not?  
These are strange times  
And I don't want to live this way  
When you wake up from a nightmare  
And it's worse when you're awake  
And there's no one you can turn to  
And there's nothing you can take  
Are you real or not?  
It's a fine line  
Are you ready or not  
For the light of day ?  
Are you real or not?  
These are strange times  
And I don't want to live this way  
  
  

Some prayers never reach the sky  
Some wounds never heal  
They still say someday the South will rise  
Man, I want to see that deal  
  
I don't want to grow old gracefully  
I don't want to go 'til it's too late  
I'll be some old man in the road somewhere  
Kneeling down in the dust by the side of the interstate  
  
[Chorus]  
I am a renegade  
I've been a rebel all my days  
I am a renegade  
I've been a rebel all my days  
  
We were hopelessly outnumbered  
It was a lost cause all along  
But when we heard the bugles call  
We swore we'd stand or fall together right or wrong  
  
We ain't seen no reconstruction here  
Just the scorched earth all around  
And the high school band played "Dixieland"  
While they tore our tattered flags and banners down  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Some prayers never reach the sky  
Some wars never end  
Some dreams refuse to die  
Next time I would rather break than bend  
  
[Chorus]

Roland was a warrior from the Land of the Midnight Sun  
With a Thompson gun for hire, fighting to be done  
The deal was made in Denmark on a dark and stormy day  
So he set out for Biafra to join the bloody fray  
  
Through sixty-six and seven they fought the Congo war  
With their fingers on their triggers, knee-deep in gore  
For days and nights they battled the Bantu to their knees  
They killed to earn their living and to help out the Congolese  
  
Roland the Thompson gunner...  
  
His comrades fought beside him - Van Owen and the rest  
But of all the Thompson gunners, Roland was the best  
So the CIA decided they wanted Roland dead  
That son-of-a-bitch Van Owen blew off Roland's head  
  
Roland the headless Thompson gunner  
Norway's bravest son  
Time, time, time  
For another peaceful war  
But time stands still for Roland  
'Til he evens up the score  
They can still see his headless body stalking through the night  
In the muzzle flash of Roland's Thompson gun  
In the muzzle flash of Roland's Thompson gun  
  
Roland searched the continent for the man who'd done him in  
He found him in Mombassa in a barroom drinking gin  
Roland aimed his Thompson gun - he didn't say a word  
But he blew Van Owen's body from there to Johannesburg  
  
Roland the headless Thompson gunner...  
The eternal Thompson gunner  
still wandering through the night  
Now it's ten years later but he still keeps up the fight  
In Ireland, in Lebanon, in Palestine and Berkeley  
Patty Hearst heard the burst of Roland's Thompson gun and bought it

Johnny never knew what hit him  
When he first met Julia  
He used to be so wild and free  
Time treats everybody like a fool  
You gotta roll with the punches  
The sun is sinkin' low  
You gotta roll with the punches  
Honey, we ain't never goin' home  
Johnny had a '57 Chevy  
With four-on-the-floor and a 429  
We used to take it out to Wild Horse Pike  
Run it out to the end of the line  
You gotta roll with the punches  
The sun is sinkin' low  
You gotta roll with the punches  
Honey, we ain't never goin' home

Got a Glock in the bedside table  
Machine gun leaning by the bedroom door  
Kevlar vest in the closet  
Well, I wear it when I go to the store  
  
Shadows on the window  
Rustling in the hedge  
Faces at the peephole  
Footsteps on the ledge  
  
If you come calling  
He'll be mauling with intent to maim  
Don't knock on my door  
If you don't know my Rottweiler's name  
  
Halogen lights in the driveway  
Guardian Angels living next door  
One hundred pounds of unfriendly persuasion  
Sleeping on the Florida porch  
  
Slackers in the market  
Bangers in the mall  
Skinheads on the golf course  
Hunting for their balls  
  
If you come calling  
He'll be mauling with intent to maim  
Don't knock on my door  
If you don't know my Rottweiler's name  
  
Well, he's dreaming about an intruder or two  
And the promise of burglar blood  
He's yearning to chew on a gangster tattoo  
And to hear the proverbial sickening thud  
  
Shadows on the window  
Rustling in the hedge  
Faces at the peephole  
Footsteps on the ledge  
  
If you come calling  
He'll be mauling with intent to maim  
Don't knock on my door  
If you don't know my Rottweiler's name

Know these blues are gonna rub me raw  
Every single cure seems to be against the law  
  
Went and told my psychic  
I said "Keep it to yourself,  
I don't wanna hear it and don't be telling no one else."  
  
Word's out on the street  
Whispers in the night  
They come out of the woodwork, wanna see what it's like  
  
Pickle ickle ickle  
Gonna run that voodoo down  
How the crowd gets fickle when your face is to the ground!  
  
Oh no these blues are gonna rub me raw  
Oh no these blues are gonna rub me raw  
  
Now I'm shaking all over  
I'm a shattering mass  
But I'm gonna sit up straight  
I'm going to take it with class  
  
Old man used to tell me  
"Son, never look back,  
Move on to the next case.  
Fold your clothes and pack."  
  
To the green horned chicken hoppers I say  
"Get yourself a trade,  
Or go hack to the chat room and fade in the shade"  
  
Oh no these blues are gonna rub me raw  
Oh no these blues are gonna rub me raw  
  
I know these blues are gonna rub me raw  
Every single cure seems to be against the law  
  
I was walking pretty well then I fell into a hole  
I should climb out quick, but I hate doing what I'm told  
  
Got a wang dang doodle wrapped in bog snake hide  
This goat head gumbo is keeping me alive  
  
I don't want your pity or your fifty dollar words  
I don't share your need to discuss the absurd  
  
Oh no these blues are gonna rub me raw  
Oh no these blues are gonna rub me raw

I went walking in the wasted city  
Started thinking about entropy  
Smelled the wind from the ruined river  
Went home to watch TV  
  
And it's worse when I try to remember  
When I think about then and now  
I'd rather see it on the news at eleven  
Sit back, and watch it run straight down  
  
Run straight down  
Run straight down  
I can see it with my eyes closed  
Run straight down  
  
We've been living in the shadows all our lives  
Where it's stand in line and don't look back and don't look left and don't
look right  
So we hide our eyes and wonder who'll survive  
Waiting for the night...  
  
Fluorocarbons in the ozone layer  
First the water and the wildlife go  
Pretty soon there's not a creature stirring  
'Cept the robots at the dynamo  
  
And it's worse when I try to remember  
When I think about then and now  
I'd rather see it on the news at eleven  
Sit back, and watch it run straight down  
  
Run straight down  
Run straight down  
I can see it with my eyes closed  
Run straight down

Every day I get up in the morning and go to work  
And do my job whatever  
I need some  
Sentimental hygiene  
  
Everybody's at war these days  
Let's have a mini-surrender  
I need some  
Sentimental hygiene  
  
Everybody's had to hurt about it  
No one wants to go without it  
It's so hard to find it  
Sentimental hygiene  
  
Every night I come home exhausted  
From trying to get along  
I need some  
Sentimental hygiene  
  
Everybody's joining up to fight  
For the right to be wrong  
I need some  
Sentimental hygiene  
  
Some nights I drive my car  
Up and down the boulevard  
It's so hard to find it  
Sentimental hygiene  
  
Everybody's had to hurt about it  
No one wants to go without it  
It's so hard to find it  
Sentimental hygiene  
  
Some nights I drive my car  
Up and down the boulevard  
It's so hard to find it  
Sentimental hygiene  
  
Sentimental hygiene  
I need some  
Sentimental hygiene

All you guitar players  
Scalding hot  
And Zeke's going at it  
Givin' it everything he's got  
'Cause anything goes  
Whatever it takes  
I might pitch a fit  
But I won't put on my brakes  
  
[Chorus:]  
Stand in the fire, stand in the fire,  
Stand in the fire, stand in the fire, stand in the fire  
Stand in the fire, stand in the fire, stand in the fire  
Stand in the fire, stand in the fire, stand in the fire  
  
I see a red-headed girl  
In the red silk dress  
Ya' know, I'm asking her to dance with me  
She might say yes  
Feel the heat  
From the beat  
Don't it burn you too?  
And all I want to do  
Is just... Rock you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Stand... In the fire, stand in the fire [Repeat x 2]

She lights up the sky  
Then she's gone  
She don't have time for love  
She don't need me now  
Can't she see I'm burning up  
Burning down, burning out  
Suzie Lightning  
I built a world for her  
Suzie Lightning  
I need a girl from earth  
  

Mama, where's your pretty little girl tonight?  
Trying to run before she can walk, that's right  
She's growing up, she has a young man waiting  
She's growing up, she has a young man waiting  
Wide eyes, she'll be street-wise  
To the lies and the jive talk  
But she'll find true love  
And tenderness on the block  
Daddy, don't you ask her when she's coming in  
And when she's home don't ask her where she's been  
She's going out, she has a young man waiting  
She's going out, can't keep her young man waiting  
She'll be okay, let her have her day  
'Cause it's a long way, it's a long walk  
But she'll find true love  
And tenderness on the block  
I know how much it hurts to see her go  
She has a mind of her own, you know  
She's all grown up, she has a young man waiting  
She's all grown up, she has a young man waiting  
She was wide-eyed, now she's street-wise  
To the lies and the jive talk  
But she'll find true love  
And tenderness on the block  
She'll find true love  
And tenderness on the block  

Nuclear arms in the Middle East  
Israel is attacking the Iraqis  
The Syrians are mad at the Lebanese  
And Baghdad does whatever she please  
Looks like another threat to world peace  
For the envoy  
  
Things got hot in El Salvador  
C-I-A got caught and couldn't do no more  
He's got diplomatic immunity  
He's got a lethal weapon that nobody sees  
Looks like another threat to world peace  
For the envoy  
Send the envoy  
Send the envoy  
  
Whenever there's a crisis  
The President sends his envoy in  
Guns in Damascus  
Oh, Jerusalem  
  
Nuclear arms in the Middle East  
Israel is attacking the Iraqis  
The Syrians are mad at the Lebanese  
And Baghdad do whatever she please  
Looks like another threat to world peace  
For the envoy  
Send the envoy  
Send for me

I heard Woodrow Wilson's guns  
I heard Maria crying  
Late last night I heard the news  
That was dying  
Veracruz was dying  
Someone called Maria's name  
I swear it was my father's voice  
Saying, "If you stay you'll all be slain  
You must leave now - you have no choice  
Take the servants and ride west  
Keep the child close to your chest  
When the American troops withdraw  
Let Zapata take the rest"  
I heard Woodrow Wilson's guns  
I heard Maria calling  
Saying, "Veracruz is dying  
And Cuernavaca's falling"  
Aquel dia yo jure (On that day I swore  
Hacia el puerto volvere To the port I will return  
Aunque el destino cambio mi vida Even though destiny changed my life  
En morire In I shall die  
Aquel dia yo jure On that day I swore)  
I heard Woodrow Wilson's guns  
I heard them in the harbor  
Saying, "Veracruz is dying"

I am wanted dead or alive  
I'm wanted everywhere  
I've got to survive  
They say I am a violent man  
Only trying to do the best I can, dig it  
I am wanted dead or alive  
Fifteen states I've got to survive  
I am wanted dead or alive  
I'm a new kind of man  
I've got to survive  
Running a long way  
I am wanted dead or alive  
I'm wanted everywhere  
I've got to survive  
Now all I'm trying to do  
Is find a peaceful place  
But they say I have an outlaw face  
My Lord, I have an outlaw's face  
I have an outlaw's face  
They say I have an outlaw's face  
My, my, yes, I have an outlaw's face  
I have an outlaw's face, I have an outlaw's face  
Oh my Lord, I have an outlaw's face  
Sweet God Almighty, I have an outlaw's face
