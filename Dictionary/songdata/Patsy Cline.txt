Anytime you're feeling lonely,  
Anytime you're feeling blue,  
Anytime you feel down-hearted,  
That will prove your love for me is true!  
  
Anytime you're thinking bout me,  
That's the time I'll be thinking of you!  
So anytime you say you want me back again,  
That's the time I'll come on home to you!  
Anytime you feel down-hearted,  
That will prove your love for me is true!  
  
Anytime you're thinking bout me,  
That's the time I'll be thinking of you!  
So anytime you say you want me back again,  
That's the time I'll come on home to you!  
That's the time I'll come on home to you!

[Chorus]  
I'm back in baby's arms  
How I missed those lovin' arms  
I'm back where I belong  
Back in baby's arms  
  
Don't know why we quarreled  
We never did before  
Since we found out how it hurt  
I bet we never quarrel anymore  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Thought I didn't need his love  
'Til he took it away  
Now I'm back where I belong  
And in my baby's arms I'm gonna stay  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Back in baby's arms, back in baby's arms, back in baby's arms

Won't you come home, Bill Bailey, won't you come home  
I moan the whole night long  
I'll do the cookin', honey, I'll pay the rent  
I know I done you wrong  
  
Remember that rainy eve' that  
I drove you out with nothin' but a fine tooth comb  
Yes, I know that I'm to blame, and ain't that a shame  
Bill Bailey, won't you please come home  
  
Won't you come home, Bill Bailey, won't you come home  
I moan the whole night long  
I'm-a gonna do your cookin', honey, I'm-a gonna pay your rent  
I know that I've done you wrong  
  
Remember that rainy eve' that  
I drove you out with nothin' but a fine tooth comb  
Well, I know that I'm to blame, and ain't that a dirty, low-down shame  
Bill Bailey, won't you please come home  
Come home, come home, Bill Bailey  
Bill Bailey, won't you please come on home  
Come home, Bill Bailey  
Bill Bailey, won't you please come on home  
Come on home  

I said blue moon of Kentucky, keep on a-shining  
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue  
Blue moon of Kentucky, keep on a-shining  
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue  
  
It was on one moonlit night, stars shining bright  
Whispered on high, love said goodbye  
  
I said blue moon of Kentucky, keep on a-shining  
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue  
  
Blue moon of Kentucky, keep on a-shining  
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue  
Blue moon of Kentucky, keep on a-shining  
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue  
  
Well, it was on one moonlit night, stars shining bright  
Whispered on high, your lover said goodbye  
I said blue moon of Kentucky, keep on a-shining  
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue  
  
Left me blue  
Left me blue  
Left me blue

Come on in and sit right down and make yourself at home  
If I had one wish, I wish I could  
Go back to my old neighborhood  
Where the good folks they all love you as their own  
Then I'd go over to my neighbor's house  
Knock on the door 'n they'd all sing out  
Come on in and sit right down and make yourself at home  
  
I'd sing their praises long and loud  
Cause their all my folks and I'm mighty proud  
Of the little old town back home where I was born  
I wish that I could hear them say  
In the good old-fashioned, friendly way  
Come on in and sit right down and make yourself at home  
  
Well, they don't lock their doors at night  
'Cause they all know they're a-doin' right  
And the good lord's bound to have them for his own  
If I'd go back to hear them pray  
In the little pine church, they all would say  
Come on in and sit right down and make yourself at home  
  
When I was a child of only three  
I said my prayers at my mother's knee  
And I knew right then from god I'd never roam  
When I get my summons on the judgment day  
I hope I can hear my savior say  
Come on in and sit right down and make yourself at home  
Now, come on in and sit right down and make yourself at home

Crazy, I'm crazy for feeling so lonely  
I'm crazy, crazy for feeling so blue  
I knew you'd love me as long as you wanted  
And then someday you'd leave me for somebody new  
  
Worry, why do I let myself worry?  
Wondering what in the world did I do?  
Crazy for thinking that my love could hold you  
I'm crazy for trying and crazy for crying  
  
And I'm crazy for loving you  
Crazy for thinking that my love could hold you  
I'm crazy for trying and crazy for crying  
And I'm crazy for loving you.

(feat. Loretta Lynn)  
  
I remember daddy's hands folded silently in prayer  
And reachin' out to hold me, when I had a nightmare  
You could read quite a story in the callous' and lines  
Years of work and worry had left their mark behind  
  
Verse 2  
I remember daddy's hands how they held my mama tight  
And patted my back for something done right  
There are things that I'd forgotten that I loved about the man  
But I'll always remember the love in daddy's hands  
  
Chorus  
Daddy's hands were soft and kind when I was cryin'  
Daddy's hands were hard as steel when I'd done wrong  
Daddy's hands weren't always gentle but I've come to understand  
There was always love in daddy's hands.  
  
Verse 3  
I remember daddy's hands workin' 'til they bled  
Sacrifised unselfishly just to keep us all fed  
If I could do things over, I'd live my life again  
And never take for granted the love in daddy's hands  
  
Repeat chorus

I go to church on a Sunday  
The vows that I make  
I break them on Monday  
The rest of the week  
I do as I please  
Then come Sunday morning  
I pray on my knees  
  
[Chorus]  
Dear God  
I know I'm not worthy  
But I need you so  
Please won't you hurry  
And help me turn back from  
The path I have trod  
You'll never be sorry  
Dear God  
  
Each day we read in the paper  
Of the carrying on  
Of some of our neighbors  
We're sinnin', and lyin',  
And forgetting the faith  
Then we have the nerve  
To ask is it to late  
  
[Chorus]

Wake up every morning, heart's full of pain  
Looked out the window and it's pouring down the rain  
And I cry, "Baby, oh, baby  
Don't ever leave me again"  
I miss your lovin', your kisses too  
Ain't nothin' on earth, I wouldn't do for you  
And I cry, "Baby, oh, baby  
Don't ever leave me again"  
When rain starts falling  
And I start calling  
Oh baby, how I love you  
My heart is cryin', I feel like dyin'  
Baby you know, I want you so  
Tell me that you're mine till the end of time  
And I cry, "Baby, oh, baby  
Don't ever leave me again  
Don't ever leave me again"  
When rain starts falling  
And I start calling  
Oh baby, how I love you  
My heart is cryin', I feel like dyin'  
Baby ya know, I want you so  
Tell me that you're mine till the end of time  
And I cry, "Baby, oh, baby  
Don't ever leave me again, no  
Don't ever leave me again"  

Well I met my little blue-eyed dog  
Down by the riverside  
Down by the riverside  
Down by the riverside  
Well I met my little blue-eyed dog  
Down by the riverside  
Down by the riverside  
Well I asked him for a little kiss  
Down by the riverside  
Down by the riverside  
Down by the riverside  
Well I asked him for a little kiss  
Down by the riverside  
Down by the riverside  
I said have patience little man  
But I'm sure you'll understand  
I hardly know your name  
You said If I can have my way  
But it maybe some sweet day  
Your name and my will be the same  
Well I wed that little blue-eyed dog  
Down by the riverside  
Down by the riverside  
Down by the riverside  
Well I wed that little blue-eyed dog  
Down by the riverside  
Down by the riverside

I feel the fingerprints  
That you left on my heart  
You played a game of love  
And then you said we had to part  
You left me all alone  
And as the teardrops start  
I feel the fingerprints  
Of sorrow on my heart  
  
I know you didn't mean to be unkind  
And hurt me so  
And you've made up your mind  
But I just thought you ought to know  
  
That when the day is through  
I think of only you  
I sit alone and dream  
And think of things we didn't do  
Now I am all alone  
And as the teardrops start  
I feel the fingerprints  
That you left on my heart  
  
And when the day is through  
I think of only you  
I sit alone and dream  
And think of things we didn't do  
Now I am all alone  
And as the teardrops start  
I feel the fingerprints  
That you left on my heart

I know that you've been foolin' around on me right from the start  
So I'll give back your ring and I'll take back my heart  
And when you're tire of foolin' around with two or three  
  
Just come on home and fool around with me.  
Then come on home and fool around with me.  
  
Well I wasn't foolin' around the day I said I do  
But many a night I wished that I had been a-foolin' too  
I know it's foolish taking all this misery  
But when it's you a fool I'll always be  
  
So honey fool around. You know right where I'm at  
And don't worry if I'm lonesome cause I'm used to that  
And when you're tire of foolin' around with two or three  
Then come on home and fool around with me  
  
I know that you've been foolin' around on me right from the start  
So I'll give back your ring and I'll take back my heart  
And when you're tire of foolin' round with two or three  
Just come on home and fool around with me.

Have you ever been lonely have you ever been blue  
Have you ever loved someone just as I love you  
Can't you see I'm sorry for each mistake I've made  
Can't you see I've changed dear can't you see I've paid  
  
Be a little forgiving take me back in your heart  
How can I go on living now that we're apart  
If you knew what I've been through then you'd know why I ask you  
Have you ever been lonely have you ever been blue  
  
If you knew what I've been through...

He called me baby, baby, all night long  
Used to hold and kiss me until dawn  
Then one day I woke, and he was gone  
Now there's no more baby, baby, all night long  
He called me baby, baby, all night long  
Kissed my tears away when things went wrong  
Oh what I'd give, if he'd just come on back home  
And call me baby, baby, all night long  
He called me baby, baby, all night long  
Built me up so high, and made me strong  
Now each night, in dreams, just like a song  
I still hear baby, baby  
Still hear baby, baby  
Still hear baby, baby, all night long

Heartaches, heartaches  
My loving you meant only heartaches  
Your kiss was such a sacred thing to me  
I can't believe it's just a burning memory  
  
Heartaches, heartaches  
What does it matter how my heart breaks  
I should be happy with someone new  
But my heart aches for you  
  
Heartaches, heartaches  
My loving you meant only heartaches  
Your kiss was such a sacred thing to me  
I can't believe it's just a burning memory  
  
Heartaches, heartaches  
What does it matter how my heart breaks  
I should be happy with someone new  
But my heart aches for you  
  
Heartaches, heartaches  
What does it matter how my heart breaks  
I should be happy with someone new  
But my heart aches  
And my heart breaks  
And my heart aches for you

People point us out and shake their heads in shame  
In gossip circles we are talked about  
Darlin, on you I hold no legal claim  
But here we are again hidin' out  
  
The kisses that you give make our wrong seem so right  
It's too late to stop, there's no doubt  
We said we wouldn't meet tonight, my dear  
But here we are again hidin' out  
  
The ones we're tied to, we know we'll hurt, my dear  
Though we're hoping they don't find us out  
Sooner or later, we know we'll be caught  
But here we are again hidin' out

I'm on a honky tonk merry-go-round  
Makin' ever spot in town  
Startin' out early, comin' home late  
Ever' night with a brand new date  
  
I'm on a honky tonk merry-go-round  
Actin' like a foolish clown  
Still racin' those blues that you left with me  
Wond'rin' if I'll ever be free  
  
[Chorus]  
Round and around and around I go  
Ridin' high and feelin' low  
Round and around just like a top  
Well, I'm a-gettin' dizzy, but I can't stop  
  
I'm on a honky tonk merry-go-round  
Actin' like a foolish clown  
Still racin' those blues that you left with me  
Wond'rin' if I'll ever be free  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm on a honky tonk merry-go-round  
Actin' like a foolish clown  
Still racin' those blues that you left with me  
Wond'rin' if I'll ever be free  
  
Yes, I'm wonderin' if I'll ever be free

I'm hungry for love  
Like a hobo for food  
Like the devil hunts for bad  
Like the angel looks for good  
  
I've been oh, so lonesome  
Your letters aren't enough  
My arms will welcome you home, dear  
I'm hungry for love  
  
I've cried so many tears, dear  
Sweetheart, since you've been gone  
I hope that you forgive me  
I'll admit that I was wrong  
  
I won't try to change you  
I miss you much to much  
Darlin' please come home  
I'm hungry for love  
  
I've cried so many tears, dear  
Sweetheart, since you've been gone  
I hope that you forgive me  
I'll admit that I was wrong  
  
I won't try to change you  
I miss you much to much  
Darlin' please come home  
I'm hungry for love

I can't forget you  
I've got these memories of you  
I can't forget you  
I'll always be loving you  
  
Once we were happy  
We were so carefree and gay  
Then something happened  
And you went away  
  
I can't forget you  
Please tell me what must I do  
My memories haunt me  
Because I'll always love you  
  
Where are you darlin'  
Are you with someone new  
I can't forget you  
I'll always be loving you  
  
I can't forget you  
I've got these memories of you  
I can't forget you  
I'll always be loving you  
  
I can't forget you  
Please tell me what must I do  
My memories haunt me  
Because I'll always love you  
  
Where are you darlin'  
Are you with someone new  
I can't forget you  
I'll always be loving you

Don't wanta walk unless I'm walkin' with you  
Don't wanta talk unless I'm talkin' to you  
Don't wanta be lonesome, don't wanta be blue  
Baby, that's how much I love you  
  
Don't wanta cry unless I'm cryin' for you  
Don't wanta sigh unless I'm sighin' for you  
Don't wanta be found with somebody new  
Baby, that's how much I love you  
  
[Chorus:]  
I built my whole world around you  
Darlin', don't ever break my heart  
I'm so glad that I found you  
And in my life, you'll always play a part  
  
Don't want to live unless I'm livin' with you

Don't want to be lonesome, don't wanta be blue  
Baby, that's how much I love you

Down in Dallas, near the Palace,  
I met a boy who was so cute.  
I loved his huggin, I loved his kissin,  
As we sat in his little red coupe.  
  
He said, "Tell me, confidentially,  
How much do you love me?"  
Well, I thought awhile and then I smiled,  
And this is what I told him, dontcha see:  
  
"I love you honey, I love your money,  
I love your automobile.  
I love you baby, I don't mean maybe,  
You're the sweetest thing on wheels.  
  
I love your kisses, I wouldn't miss it,  
No matter how I feel,  
I love you honey, I love your money,  
Most of all I love your automobile."

I'm blue again  
My friends all said I'd be  
I'm blue again  
Because your leavin' me  
  
This heart of mine  
So well remembers you  
Although I've lost your love  
To someone new  
  
The nights are long  
So long my darlin' hear me  
I pray that dawn will come  
And somehow, you'll be near me  
  
I'm blue again  
My heart is filled with tears  
I'm blue again  
As I think of wasted years  
  
The nights are long  
So long my darlin' hear me  
I pray that dawn will come  
And somehow, you'll be near me  
  
I'm blue again  
My heart is filled with tears  
I'm blue again  
As I think of wasted years

Well, I'm chasin' the blues  
Right out of my mind  
I'm leavin' my cares  
And worries behind  
  
'Cause I'm on my way  
I'm leavin' town today  
My lonesome old heart  
Is broken into  
  
I've been walkin' the floor  
Every night over you  
But our love is all gone  
I'm movin' on  
  
I'm a-leavin' town today  
I got no love, no cares  
Just heartaches  
I'm leavin' them all behind  
  
Like the sun and the moon  
And the stars above  
We're gonna be one of a kind  
Well, I'm movin' along  
  
I gotta be free  
I'll find a new love  
Wherever I'll be  
But my old love is gone  
  
I'm movin' on  
I'm a-leavin' town today  
I got no love, no cares  
No heartaches  
  
I'm leavin' them all behind  
Like the sun, and the moon  
And the stars above  
We're gonna be one of a kind  
  
Well I'm movin' along  
I gotta be free  
I'll find a new love  
Wherever I'll be  
  
But my old love is gone  
I'm movin' on  
I'm a-leavin' town today  
I'm leavin' this town today

I'm a-walkin' the dog and I'm never blue  
I'm a-walkin' that dog, I not thinkin' 'bout you  
I don't need no one to tie me down  
'Cause I'm walkin' that dog and a-paintin' the town  
  
Such an easy life, I never knew  
Well, I can't believe that it's really true  
Well, I'm a carefree gal that's seen the light  
And I'm a-walkin' that dog all the day and all night  
  
Well, I'm full of pep, I just can't grow old  
I got a one-track mind, so I've been told  
But I'm fancy free, I don't worry no how  
'Cause I'm walkin' that dog, all the law will allow  
  
Such an easy life, I never knew  
Until the day that I left you  
Well, I'm a carefree gal that's seen the light  
And I'm walkin' that dog all the day and all night

Imagine me still lovin' you  
After all you've put me through  
Well, I can't help it, I just do  
Imagine that, and that's not the half  
  
Imagine this, if you can  
I've stood more, more than I should stand  
But I'd still take you back again  
Imagine that, ain't that a laugh  
  
Can you believe I'd swallow my pride  
Well, yes, yes, I guess you can  
'Cause you know you've always had my foolish heart  
Right in the palm of your hand  
  
So, for what it's worth to you  
It just don't matter what you might do  
'Cause I'm still waitin' and lovin' you  
Imagine that, ain't that a laugh  
  
(Repeat last verse)

Now, baby if you're needin' me  
The way that I been needin' you  
Well, drop me a line  
Sayin' honey you'll be mine  
Write me in care of the blues  
  
I hope that you've been missin' me  
The way that I've been missin' you  
I shouldn't have let you go  
Because I miss you so  
Write me in care of the blues  
  
Give that postman your letter  
And he'll know what to do  
He'll bring your letter to me  
And a plane will bring me to you  
  
Now, baby if you're needin' me  
The way that I been needin' you  
Just drop me a line  
Sayin' honey you'll be mine  
Write me in care of the blues  
  
(Repeat last two verses)

It wasn't God who made honky tonk angels  
(j. d. miller)  
As I sit here tonight, the jukebox playing  
The tune about the wild side of life  
As I listen to the words you are saying  
It brings mem'ries when I was a trustful wife  
  
Chorus:  
It wasn't God who made honky tonk angels  
As you said in the words of your song  
Too many times married men think they're still single  
That has caused many a good girl to go wrong  
  
It's a shame that all the blame is on us women  
It's not true that only you men feel the same  
From the start, 'most every heart that's ever broken  
Was because there always was a man to blame  
  
(chorus)

I've got your picture,  
That you gave to me,  
And it's signed with love,  
Just like it used to be.  
  
The only thing different, the only thing new.  
I've got your picture, she's got you.  
  
I've got the records,  
That we used to share,  
And they still sound the same,  
As when you were here.  
  
The only thing different, the only thing new.  
I've got the records, she's got you.  
  
I got your memory,  
Or, has it got me?  
I really don't know,  
But I know is it wont let me be.  
  
I've got your class ring,  
That proved you care,  
And it looks the same,  
As when you gave it dear.  
  
The only thing different, the only thing new.  
I've got these little things, she's got you.  
  
I've got your memory,  
Or, has it got me?  
I really don't know,  
But I know, it wont let me be.  
  
I've got your class ring,  
That proved you care,  
And it still looks the same,  
As when you gave it dear,  
  
The only thing different, the only thing new  
I've got these little things, she's got you.

I've loved and lost again  
Oh, what a crazy world we're livin' in  
True love has no chance to win  
I've loved and lost again  
  
I ask you what chance have I  
When each love I meet just makes me cry  
He loves awhile then says goodbye  
I've loved and lost again  
  
[CHORUS:]  
To be true to one alone  
Don't seem to matter anymore  
They tell you you're out of style  
Unless you've had three or four  
  
[REPEAT FIRST VERSE]  
  
[REPEAT CHORUS]  
  
[REPEAT FIRST VERSE]

I am weak but Thou art strong  
Jesus keep me from all wrong  
I'll be satisfied as long  
As I walk, let me walk close to Thee  
  
[Chorus]  
Just a closer walk with Thee  
Grant it, Jesus, is my plea  
Daily walking close to Thee  
Let it be, dear Lord, let it be  
  
When my feeble life is o'er  
Time for me shall be no more  
Guide me gently, safely o'er  
To Thy kingdom's shore, to Thy shore  
  
When life's sun sinks in the west  
Lord, may I have done my best  
May I find sweet peace and rest  
In that happy home of the blessed  
  
[Chorus]

Love that runs away from me  
Dreams that just won't let me be  
Blues that keep on botherin' me  
Chains that just won't set me free  
Too far away from you and all your charms  
Just out of reach of my two empty arms  
  
Each night in dreams I see your face  
Memories time can't erase  
I awake and find you gone  
I'm so blue and all alone  
So far away from lips so sweet and warm  
Just out of reach of my two empty arms  
  
That ol' lonesome feelin' all the time  
I know you'll never be mine  
Dreams that hurt me in my sleep  
I mean vows that we just couldn't keep  
  
Too far away from you and all your charms  
Just out of reach of my two empty arms

If you got leavin' on your mind  
Tell me now, get it over  
Hurt me now, get it over  
If you got leavin' on your mind  
  
If there's a new love in your heart  
Tell me now, get it over  
Hurt me now, get it over  
If there's a new love in your heart  
  
Don't leave me here, in a world  
Filled with dreams that might have been  
Hurt me now, get it over  
I may learn to love again  
  
If there's a new love in your heart  
Tell me now, get it over  
Hurt me now, get it over  
If there's a new love in your heart  
  
Hurt me now, get it over  
If there's a new love in your heart

Life is like a mountain railroad  
With an engineer that's brave  
We must make the run successful  
From the cradle to the grave  
  
Watch the curves, the fills, and tunnels  
Never falter, never fail  
Keep your hand upon the throttle  
And your eyes upon the rail  
  
Blessed Savior, Thou will guide us  
Till we reach that blissful shore  
Where the angels wait to join us  
In that great forevermore  
  
Blessed Savior, Thou will guide us  
Till we reach that blissful shore  
Where the angels wait to join us  
In that great forevermore

Where's this place called "Lonely Stree-ee-ee-eet?"  
I'm looking for that lonely street  
I've got a sad, sad tale to tell  
I need a place to go and weep  
  
Where's this place called "Lonely Stree-ee-ee-eet?"  
A place where there's just loneliness  
Where dim lights bring forgetfulness  
Where broken dreams and mem'ries meet  
  
Where's this place called "Lonely Stree-ee-ee-eet?"  
Perhaps upon that lonely street  
There's someone such as I  
Who came to bury broken dreams  
  
And watch an old love di-ie  
If I could find that lonely street  
Where dim lights bring forgetfulness  
Where broken dreams and mem'ries meet  
  
Where's this place called "Lonely Stree-ee-ee-eet?"  
Where's this place called "Lonely Stree-ee-ee-eet?"

So long we've been married  
Life's burdens we've carried  
Though faith kept us humble  
And made our love grow  
The plans that we make up  
Someone seems to break up  
But darlin' what else can we do  
  
[Chorus:]  
We may have to leave here  
To find peace of mind, dear  
Some place where we can live  
A life all our own  
For I know you love me  
And happy we could be  
If some folks would leave us alone  
  
They say you are leaving  
That you are deceiving  
But you tell me they say  
The same about me  
But we'll show them that they're wrong  
That loose talk will do harm  
And hope that the truth they will see  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When I go out walkin'  
There's lots of loose talkin'  
They say we're unhappy  
And we'll break apart  
But, darling, it's not true  
Because I still love you  
And I do with all of my heart  
Yeah!  
  
[Chorus]

My love is deeper than the world's deepest sea  
My love is stronger than the mightiest tree  
My love is real, my love is true  
Darlin', you know that's the love I have for you  
  
[Chorus]  
Well, love me, love me, honey do  
You know I'll always be true  
Love me honey, squeeze me tight  
Hug me honey, with all your might  
Love me, love me, honey do  
  
Your love is warmer than a bright shiny day  
It makes me tingle, and I like it that way  
Your love is sweet, sweet as can be  
Darlin', please say that your love is all for me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Your love is warmer than a bright shiny day  
It makes me tingle, and I like it that way  
Your love is sweet, sweet as can be  
Darlin', please say that your love is all for me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Love me, love me, honey do  
Love me, love me, honey do

I still want your lovin'  
And I still need your lovin'  
But I can't live a life of lovin' in vain  
Last night I saw you a-walkin  
Talkin' with another  
Overheard you tell her  
Our love don't mean a thing  
And as I walked away dear  
My heart broke down inside me  
I still want your lovin'  
And I still need your lovin'  
But I can't live a life of lovin' in vain  
I'd rather be a poor girl  
Not a penny to my name  
Than to know my life  
Would all be lived in vain  
I'd rather be alone dear  
If you don't want to change  
I still want your lovin'  
And I still need your lovin'  
But I can't live a life of lovin' in vain  
I still want your lovin'  
And I still need your lovin'  
But I can't live a life of lovin' in vain  
  

Once my love was good enough  
True happiness we knew  
Then fame and fortune came your way  
And made a change in you  
You'll find your ladder of success  
Is not on solid ground  
And when it starts to tumble  
Pick me up on your way down  
Pick me up when dreams are shattered  
When false friends cannot be found  
For you know I'll still be waiting  
Pick me up on your way down  
You've hit the top, but it won't last  
There's just one way to go  
The world you've chosen is not real  
These things you'll come to know  
When folks say they don't know you  
And you've lost your final round  
When you find that you are lonely  
Pick me up on your way down  
Pick me up when dreams are shattered  
When false friends cannot be found  
For you know I'll still be waiting  
Pick me up on your way down  

Deep within my heart lies a melody,  
A song of old San Antone.  
Where in dreams I live with a memory,  
Beneath the stars, all alone.  
  
Well it was there I found, beside the Alamo,  
Enchantments strange as the blue up above.  
For that moonlit pass, that only he would know,  
Still hears my broken song of love.  
  
Moon in all your splendor, known only to my heart,  
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone.  
Lips so sweet and tender, like petals falling apart,  
Speak once again of my love, my own.  
  
Broken song, empty words I know,  
Still live in my heart all alone.  
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo,  
And rose, my rose of San Antone.  
  
Broken song, empty words I know,  
Still live in my heart all alone.  
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo.  
And rose, my rose of San Antone.  
  
And rose, my rose of San Antone.  
And rose, my rose of San Antone.

Seven lonely days make one lonely week  
Seven lonely nights make one lonely me  
Ever since the time you told me we were through  
Seven lonely days I cried and I cried for you  
  
Oh, my darlin' you're cryin', boo-hoo-hoo-hoo  
There's no use in denyin' I cried for you  
It was your favorite pastime, makin' me blue  
Last week was the last time I cried for you  
  
Seven hankies blue I filled with my tears  
Seven letters, too, I filled with my fears  
Guess it never pays to make your lover blue  
Seven lonely days I cried and I cried for you  
  
Oh, my darlin you're cryin', boo-hoo-hoo-hoo  
Now, there's no use in denyin' I cried for you  
It was your favorite pastime, makin' me blue  
Last week was the last time I cried for you  
Last week was the last time I cried for you

South of the border, down Mexico way  
That's where they fell in love  
When stars above  
Came out to play  
And now as they wander, their thoughts ever stray  
South of the border, down Mexico way  
  
She was a picture in old Spanish lace  
Just for a tender while  
He kissed the smile  
Upon her face  
For it was "Fiesta" and they were so gay  
South of the border, down Mexico way  
  
Then she sighed as she whispered "ma'ana"  
Never dreaming that they were parting  
And he lied as he whispered "ma'ana"  
For that tomorrow never came  
  
South of the border, he rode back one day  
There in a veil of white  
By candlelight  
She knelt to pray  
The mission bells told him that he mustn't stay  
South of the border, down Mexico way  
  
Ay-ay-ay-ay, ay-ay-ay-ay  
Ay-ay-ay-ay, ay-ay-ay-ay

Sometimes it's hard to be a woman  
Givin' all your love to just one man  
You'll have bad times, and he'll have good times  
Doin' things that you don't understand  
  
But if you love him, then you'll forgive him  
Even though he's hard to understand  
And if you love him, oh, be proud of him  
'Cause after all he's just a man  
  
Stand by your man  
Give him two arms to cling to  
And somethin' warm to come to  
When nights are cold and lonely  
  
Stand by your man  
And show the world you love him  
Keep givin' all the love you can  
Stand by your man  
  
Stand by your man  
And show the world you love him  
Keep givin' all the love you can  
Stand by your man

Well, I know a cool cat from way downtown  
He's been boppin' all around  
In this ole world he's livin' fast  
Someday I'm afraid he's gonna run outta gas  
So if you're travelin' that way, too  
I tell you, friend, what you better do  
  
Ya gotta stop, look and listen  
Hey, ya don't know what you're missin'  
Ya gotta stop, look and listen  
'Cause ya might be missin' kissin'  
If you're trav'lin' slow, you'll go a long, long way  
  
Now, Farmer Jones, he came to town  
And saw that boppin' all around  
He learned to do it, there's no doubt  
I'm afraid someday he'll burn his motor out  
So if you're travelin' that way, too  
I tell you, friend, what you better do  
  
First came the boogie, then the bunny hop  
Now the rhumba, samba, then the bop  
Well, I don't know what's a-comin' next  
But this ole world's in a terrible fix  
So if you're travelin' that way, too  
I tell you, friend, what you better do  
  
Ya gotta stop, look and listen  
Ya gotta stop, look and listen  
Ya gotta stop, look and listen  
Ya gotta stop

Round n' around n' around  
Round n' around n' around  
Round n' around n' around  
And around and around  
  
[Chorus:]  
Oh stop the world and let me off  
I'm tired of goin' round n' round  
I played the game of love and lost  
So stop the world and let me off  
  
My heart is shattered can't you see  
'Cause you no longer care for me  
But someday I'm sure you'll see  
Loving you did this to me  
  
My dream world tumbled to the ground  
The one I love has let me down  
I lost the wonder of his kiss  
How could he leave me here like this  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Lock all this burning up inside  
I know his love for me has died  
I lost the wonder of his kiss  
How could he leave me here like this  
  
[Chorus:]

Strange, how you stopped loving me  
How you stopped needing me  
When she came along  
Oh, how strange  
  
Strange, you changed like night and day  
Just up and walked away  
When she came along  
Oh, how strange  
  
[Chorus]  
Well, I guess that I was just your puppet  
You held on a string  
To think I thought you really loved me  
But look what thoughts can bring  
  
Strange, you're still in all my dreams  
Oh what a funny thing  
I still care for you  
Oh, how strange  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Strange, you're still in all my dreams  
Oh what a funny thing  
I still care for you  
Oh, how strange  
  
How strange

Tell a little white lie  
And then multiply by ten  
And then, that's how a heartache begins  
Mix some flowers he bought  
  
With a date he forgot to attend  
And then, that's how a heartache begins  
I know about heartaches  
I know all the mistakes  
  
That a young love can make, I've made them  
So let's still be friends  
To the soft violins  
I've listened while somebody played them  
  
Call his number in vain  
Again and again, he's not in  
But then, that's how a heartache begins  
(Repeat last two verses)  
That's how a heartache begins

[VERSE 1]  
If I had a nickel, tell you what I'd do  
Spend it all for candy, n' give it all to you  
That's how much I love you, baby  
That's how much I love you  
[VERSE 2]  
If you was a tiger, I'd hang around your den  
Pester you my honey, till you let me in  
Pester you my honey, till you let me in  
That's how much I love you, baby  
That's how much I love you  
[VERSE 3]  
If you were a horse fly, an' I an ole gray mare  
Stand an' let you bite me, never move a hair  
Stand an' let you bite me, never move a hair  
That's how much I love you, baby  
That's how much I love you  
[VERSE 4]  
If we were to marry let me tell you what  
Go an' get th parson let 'I'm tie th knot  
Go an' get th parson let 'I'm tie th knot  
That's how much I love you, baby  
That's how much I love you

You think you're smart  
You broke my heart  
Left me to cry here alone but you'll return  
One day you'll learn  
The heart you break may be your own  
You promised me  
Your love would be  
A kind I'd never known tho' you weren't fair  
You're unaware  
The heart you break maybe your own  
You used my heart for a plaything  
You'll be sorry, just wait and see  
One day you'll find you are lonely  
And the first one you'll think of is me  
You'll look around  
And when you've found  
That you are all alone then you'll get wise  
And realize  
The heart you break may be your own  
You used my heart for a plaything  
You'll be sorry, just wait and see  
One day you'll find you are lonely  
And the first one you'll think of is me  
You'll look around  
And when you've found  
That you are all alone then you'll get wise  
And realize  
The heart you break may be your own  

Have you talked to the man upstairs?  
'Cause he wants to hear from you  
Have you talked to the man upstairs?  
He will always see you through  
And this trouble ever troubles you  
Now don't you run and hide  
'Cause if you ever need a friend  
He'll be there by your side  
Just turn your eyes to Heaven  
And say a simple prayer  
Through the clouds of lace  
You'll see his face  
No matter when or where  
Have you talked to the man upstairs?  
'Cause he wants to hear from you  
Have you talked to the man upstairs?  
He will always see you through  
Have you talked to the man upstairs?  
He wants to hear from you  
Have you talked to the man upstairs?  
He's always see you through  
And this trouble ever troubles you  
Well don't you run and hide  
'Cause if you ever need a friend  
He'll be there by your side  
If you talk to the man upstairs  

[Chorus]  
Oh, the wayward wind is a restless wind  
A restless wind that yearns to wander  
And he was born the next of kin  
The next of kin to the wayward wind  
  
In a lonely shack by a railroad track  
He spent his younger days  
And I guess the sound of the outward bound  
Made him a slave to his wand'rin ways  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, I met him there in a border town  
He vowed we'd never part  
Tho' he tried his best to settle down  
Now I'm alone with a broken heart  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The next of kin to the wayward wind

You don't know the meaning  
Of the words "I love you so"  
But when you've found your one love  
Then you'll know  
  
You don't know the heartache  
Or the laughter you'll forego  
Until you've lost that one love  
Then you'll know  
  
Now you pretend to care for me  
But honey, if you do  
Why don't you give the kind of kiss  
I always give to you  
  
So, I've just made my mind up  
Even though my tears will flow  
Go on and find a new love  
Then you'll know  
  
[Repeat last two verses]  
  
Then you'll know

There he goes, he's walkin' away  
Each step he takes brings heartache my way  
She won his heart, I lost him someway  
There he goes, he's walkin' away  
  
If I hadn't cheated and I hadn't lied  
I'd be the one, walkin' by his side  
I love him still and I guess that it shows  
He's walkin' away, there he goes  
  
Oh, if I hadn't cheated and I hadn't lied  
I'd be the one walkin' by his side  
I love him still and I guess that it shows  
He's walkin' away, there he goes

How warm is the love in my heart for you  
As warm as the sun in the sky of blue  
How long will it shine if you say you're mine  
Today, tomorrow and forever  
  
How strong was my love from the very start  
How long will it last in my happy heart  
How much would I cry if we'd ever part  
Today, tomorrow and forever  
  
'Cause if you weren't there to share my love  
Who cares if the sky should fall  
For anyone can see how much you mean to me  
You're my life, my love, my very all  
  
And as long as the tides of the ocean flow  
As long as the trees and the flowers grow  
So long, oh my love, will I love you so  
Today, tomorrow and forever  
  
(Repeat last two verses)  
  
Today  
Tomorrow  
And forever

Last night I met a woman  
You'll recognize her name  
Who, in our conversation  
Told me you were her old flame  
Well, I didn't want to listen  
But as she told me more  
I learned more about you  
Than I ever knew before  
  
[CHORUS:]  
(You're keepin') too many secrets from me  
But, baby, now I'm wise to you  
You'll fool me like the others  
And I know what you'll do  
You'll find yourself a new love  
And keep me a secret, too  
  
Well, I walked up to a counter  
To buy some cigarettes  
And standin' there beside me  
Was a gal I'd never met  
She pulled out her wallet  
And, much to my surprise  
There she held your picture, baby  
Right before my eyes  
  
[REPEAT CHORUS (2x)]  
  
You'll find yourself a new love  
And keep me a secret, too

Turn the cards slowly while you're dealin', darlin'  
Please don't double-deal to win my heart  
Turn the cards slowly while you're dealin', darlin'  
Don't go breakin' rules right from the start  
The ramblin', gamblin', reckless way you treat my heart's a sin  
Each night down on my knees I pray your gamblin' ways will end  
Turn the cards slowly while you're dealin', darlin'  
And if you stack the deck, then I'll move on  
Turn the cards slowly while you're dealin', darlin'  
Please don't double-deal to win my heart  
Turn the cards slowly while you're dealin', darlin'  
Don't go breakin' rules right from the start  
The ramblin', gamblin', reckless way you treat my heart's a sin  
Each night down on my knees I pray your gamblin' ways will end  
Turn the cards slowly while you're dealin', darlin'  
And if you stack the deck, then I'll move on  
Turn the cards slowly while you're dealin', darlin',  
And if you stack the deck, then I'll move on

Walk walk walk  
Walk walk walk  
A walkin' dream  
I dreamed about you  
A walkin' dream  
Can't do without you  
Lovely dream  
Just can't forget you  
'Cause your so dreamy  
Peach n' creamy  
Walkin' dream  
Now keep on a walkin'  
Keep on a talkin'  
And I'll do my best  
To make the rest  
Of this lovely dream come true  
A walkin' dream  
I want you near me  
Walkin' dream  
Can't you hear me  
A lovely dream  
A won't you love me  
'Cause your so lovey  
Turtle dovey  
A walkin' dream  
A walkin' dream  
My heart is yearnin'  
Walkin' dream  
My lips are burnin'  
A lovely dream  
Of love I'm learnin'  
Cause your surprisin'  
Tantilizin', walkin' dream  
Now keep on a walkin'  
Keep on a talkin'  
And I'll do my best  
To make the rest  
Of this lovely dream come true  
A walkin' dream  
I want you near me  
A walkin' dream  
Can't you hear me  
Lovely dream  
Won't you love me  
'Cause your so lovey  
Turtle dovey, walkin' dream  
Cause your so lovey  
Turtle dovey, walkin' dream

I go out walkin' after midnight  
Out in the moonlight  
Just like we used to do  
I'm always walkin' after midnight searchin' for you  
  
I walk for miles along the highway  
Well, that's just my way  
Of sayin' I love you  
I'm always walkin' after midnight, searchin' for you  
  
I stop to see a weepin' willow  
Cryin' on his pillow  
Maybe he's cryin' for me  
And as the skies turn gloomy  
Night winds whisper to me  
I'm lonesome as I can be  
  
I go out walkin' after midnight  
Out in the moonlight  
Just hopin' you may be  
Somewhere a-walkin' after midnight, searchin' for me  
  
I stop to see a weepin' willow  
Cryin' on his pillow  
Maybe he's cryin' for me  
And as the skies turn gloomy  
Night winds whisper to me  
I'm lonesome as I can be  
  
I go out walkin' after midnight  
Out in the moonlight  
Just hopin' you may be  
Somewhere a-walkin' after midnight, searchin' for me

You think you love Sue  
But when I get thru with you  
You won't ever look at Sue again...  
  
I'm gonna be so good to you  
I'm gonna love you my whole life thru  
Pretty soon you'll feel the same  
You won't even know her name  
I'll give ya kisses that she can't beat  
I'll treat you so nice and sweet  
When I get thru with you  
You'll love me too, not Sue  
When I get thru with you  
You'll love me too  
  
I'm gonna treat you sweet and kind  
I'll drive her right outta your mind  
And you won't know her if you meet  
Walk right by her on the street  
Because I want you and need you so  
Poor Susie will have to go  
When I get thru with you  
You'll love me too, not Sue  
When I get thru with you  
You'll love me too  
  
I'm gonna be so good to you  
I'll love you my whole life thru  
Pretty soon you'll feel the same  
You won't even know her name  
I'll give you kisses that she can't beat  
I'll treat you so nice and sweet  
When I get thru with you  
You'll love me too, not Sue  
When I get thru with you  
You'll love me too, not Sue  
When I get thru with you  
You'll love me too, not Sue...

When my dreamboat comes home  
And my dream no more will roam  
I will meet you and I'll greet you  
When my dreamboat comes home  
Moonlit waters will sing  
'Cause that tender love you'll bring  
We will be sweethearts, yes forever  
When my dreamboat comes home  
When my dreamboat, comes home  
And my dream no more will roam  
I will meet you and I'll greet you  
When my dreamboat comes home  
Moonlit waters will sing  
'Cause that tender love you'll bring  
We will be sweethearts, yes forever  
When my dreamboat comes home  

You can't imagine how it hurts me  
To have you treat me like you do  
Knowing that my love is just a joke to you  
But I'll take it just to see you  
And laugh as teardrops fall  
So when you need a laugh, give me a call  
  
Everybody says I'm crazy  
To let you treat me this way  
But I can't explain, so, what else can I say  
At least I'm on your mind when you're laughin'  
Somehow that breaks the fall  
So when you need a laugh, give me a call  
  
I'd gladly trade the laugh you get  
For making fun of me  
To be around the one I love and need so desperately  
So even if the laugh's on me  
I don't mind at all  
So when you need a laugh, give me a call  
So when you need a laugh, give me a call

I walk up to my door and hate to turn the key  
Emptiness is all that waits inside for me  
That's how it is when the one you love is gone  
That's how it is when your house is not a home  
I look around and see things marked with "his" and "hers"  
Little things like this just make things that much worse  
That's how it is since I live my life alone  
That's how it is since my house is not a home  
Is there a way out for a soul so torn as mine  
Each day I live I'm like a prisoner passing time  
That's how it is, ask anyone who lives alone  
That's how it is when your house is not a home

Who can I count on  
If I can't count on you  
I never counted on you  
Makin' me blue  
They say your a runnin' 'round  
With somebody new  
Who can I count on  
If I can't count on you  
  
I thought I held a precious key to heaven  
Your love was sweet and gentle at the start  
But now I feel that I can't go on livin'  
If livin' means that we must live apart  
  
Who can I count on  
If I can't count on you  
There goes my happiness  
And here comes the blues  
I can't convince myself that  
We're really through  
Who can I count on  
If I can't count on you  
  
The door to happiness was almost open  
Just one more step or two and I'd be in  
Then all at once the vows you made were broken  
The door to happiness was closed again  
  
Who can I count on  
If I can't count on you  
There goes my happiness  
And here comes the blues  
I can't convince myself  
That we're really through  
Who can I count on  
If I can't count on you  
Who can I count on  
Who can I count on  
Who can I count on  
If I can't count on you

Yes I understand that I'm to set you free  
Yes I understand you love her more than me  
I understand she won your heart  
Stoled your, love drew us apart  
I understand  
And so I'll let you go  
  
I tried my best to do the things  
I thought would please you dear  
I never dreamed the time would come  
When you would not be here  
  
Yes I understand what I'm supposed to do  
Find me someone else to take the place of you  
And if I live a hundred years  
I'll find some way to hide these tears  
I understand  
And so I'll let you go  
  
I tried my best to do the things  
I thought would please you dear  
I never dreamed the time would come  
When you would not be here  
  
Yes I understand what I'm supposed to do  
Find me someone else to take the place of you  
And if I live a hundred years  
I'll find some way to hide these tears  
I understand  
And so I'll let you go

You made me love you  
I didn't want to do it  
I didn't want to do it  
You made me want you  
And all the time you knew it  
I guess you always knew it  
  
You made me happy sometimes  
Sometimes you made me glad  
But there were times, dear  
You made me feel so bad  
  
You made me sigh for  
I didn't want to tell you  
I didn't want to tell you  
I want some lovin', that's true  
Yes I do, indeed I do, you know I do  
  
Give me, give me, give me what I cry for  
You know ya got the brand o' kisses that I'd die for  
You know you made me love you  
  
You made me sigh for  
I didn't want to tell you  
I didn't want to tell you  
I want some lovin', that's true  
Yes I do, indeed I do, you know I do  
  
Give me, give me, give me what I cry for  
You know ya got the brand o' kisses that I'd die for  
You know you made me love you

(1)  
You took him off my hands  
When you stepped in  
You changed everything  
We're not even friends  
  
(2)  
Don't leave the job half done  
Leave nothing behind  
You took him off my hands  
Now please take him off my mind  
  
(3)  
Please take his photograph  
Engraved on my heart so blue  
And take all his memories  
He now belongs to you  
  
(Repeat 2, 3, 2)  
  
You took him off my hands  
Now please take him off my mind

You were only fooling  
(while I was falling in love)  
  
Words by billy faber and fred meadows  
Music by larry fotine  
  
You were only fooling,  
While I was falling in love,  
It's a story as old as adam and eve,  
I was making love but you were making believe,  
  
You lied to me with kisses,  
I tried to stop dreaming of,  
But you were only fooling me,  
While I was falling in love.  
  
(repeat from start)

Your cheatin' heart will make you weep,  
You'll cry and cry, and try to sleep.  
But sleep won't come, the whole night through.  
Your cheatin' heart, will tell on you.  
  
When tears come down like falling rain,  
You'll toss around, and call my name.  
You'll walk the floor, the way I do.  
Your cheatin' heart, will tell on you.  
  
When tears come down like falling rain,  
You'll toss around, and call my name.  
You'll walk the floor, the way I do.  
Your cheatin' heart, will tell on you.

You say you love me  
Then you treat me like a stranger  
I don't understand your kind of love  
You say you need me  
And that makes it even stranger  
No, I don't understand your kind of love  
  
If you can't be all mine  
Then why am I all yours  
I wonder where a heart draws the line  
I try not to see you  
But you're a great arranger  
No, I don't understand your kind of love  
  
(Repeat last verse)  
  
No, I don't understand your kind of love

If you are sincere  
When you say you don't care  
That our love is just a memory  
If the love that we knew  
Won't bother you  
Darling, you're stronger than me  
  
[CHORUS]  
For if still loving you means I'm weak  
Then I'm weak  
For I still fall apart when we speak  
Or we meet  
If the love that we knew  
Won't bother you  
Darling you're stronger than me  
  
If you can have fun  
With some other one  
With no thought of what used to be  
If it's easy to say  
That it's better this way  
Darlin you're stronger than me  
  
[CHORUS]
