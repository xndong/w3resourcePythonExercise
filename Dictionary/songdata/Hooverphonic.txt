All I have is strictly forbidden  
And all I have is strictly insane  
We know what we want  
But that's not always good for us  
Insanity is not always despair  
  
All I have means nothing to me  
And all I give is so much more  
When nothing is left  
There's nothing to lose  
When there's nothing to lose  
There is peace of the mind  
  
We all fall into oblivion  
And history slowly fades  
What's done doesn't matter  
What matter's not done  
All we have, belongs to no one  
  
All I have means nothing to me  
And all I give is so much more  
When nothing is left  
There's nothing to lose  
When there's nothing to lose  
There is peace of the mind  
  
All I have means nothing to me  
And all I give is so much more  
When nothing is left  
There's nothing to lose  
When there's nothing to lose  
There is peace of the mind  
When there's nothing to lose  
There is peace of the mind  
  
When there's nothing to lose  
There is peace of the mind  
When there's nothing to lose  
There is peace of the mind

You are my autoharp  
I push every button on your body  
I push the a minor, the e flat, the f major  
And especially the see sharp seven  
You are my autoharp  
I play every string in your mind  
And even when I play them very loud  
They keep in tune  
But how will they sound soon  
You are my autoharp  
I bought you in a pawnshop in Virginia  
You were cheap but in good condition  
Longing for someone to take you on an exotic trip  
You are my autoharp  
I carried you all over the world  
In my hard case called the heart  
You're the reason for my blood to keep running  
Through my veins every album again

She lives in a house  
That reflects her state of mind, mind  
Organized chaos  
In this labyrinth she hides, hides  
  
She got locked up years ago  
All these voices whisper  
All these voices whisper  
Whisper and whisper  
And day after day  
Marinated in wine and tobacco  
All these voices whisper  
All these voices whisper  
Whisper and whisper  
And day after day  
After day  
  
Pink fluffy dinosaurs  
Are almost back in town, town  
Pulling all the strings  
That will finally bring her down, down  
  
She got locked up years ago  
All these voices whisper  
All these voices whisper  
Whisper and whisper  
And day after day  
Marinated in wine and tobacco  
All these voices whisper  
All these voices whisper  
Whisper and whisper  
And day after day  
After day  
After day  
After day

So you take your chances  
Look through dirty lenses  
Unintended consequences  
We don't need your ugly fences  
We'll make our own way out of here  
  
Start a car  
Get away  
There's so much you could see today  
  
If we don't escape  
We'll turn into  
Everything we hate  
But tell me, do  
We even have a chance?  
  
If we don't escape  
The things we do  
Won't make a difference  
It's just me and you  
And all our best laid plans  
  
So we've run right off the map  
Get away from all the traps  
Inevitable consequences  
Living only present tenses  
Only living for the now  
  
Start a car  
Get away  
There's so much you could see today  
  
If we don't escape  
We'll turn into  
Everything we hate  
But tell me, do  
We even have a chance?  
  
If we don't escape  
The things we do  
Won't make a difference  
It's just me and you  
And all our best laid plans  
  
If we don't escape  
We'll turn into  
Everything we hate  
But tell me, do  
We even have a chance?  
  
If we don't escape  
The things we do  
Won't make a difference  
It's just me and you  
And all our best laid plans

Did you ever think of me  
As your best friend  
  
Did I ever think of you  
I'm not complaining  
  
I never tried to feel  
I never tried to feel this vibration  
I never tried to reach  
I never tried to reach your eden  
  
Did I ever think of you  
As my enemy  
  
Did you ever think of me  
I'm complaining  
  
I never tried to feel  
I never tried to feel this vibration  
I never tried to reach  
I never tried to reach your eden

Long black dress  
Hawaiian shirt  
Kicking pair of trainers  
Electro shock faders  
  
Guiding your voice through your veins  
Sick of all this working  
Longing for a sinking  
  
Long black dress

Kicking pair of trainers  
Electro shock faders  
  
Guiding your voice through your veins  
Sick of all this working  
Longing for a sinking  
  
Ship that rules the bottom of the sea  
A bottle as a prison not really my idea  
Of a perfect environment it makes you see  
Everything's a blur  
Do you know what I mean

Is it you who's going to guide me  
Through this labyrinth of poems  
Is it you that's going to make me  
Gonna make me feel home  
And every time we live together  
We just die a bit more  
So why don't we just stop  
Oh let's just stop to adore  
Why  
Is it so hard  
To make the right choice

Johnny went to frosted flake  
To go for a walk in the frozen wood  
He bumped into a mushroom  
That sold his body for some warm food  
"Eat me my friend, you'll be the leader of the band"  
Johnny's hand reached out  
Luckily there was Mr Doubt  
Mr Doubt the old man was the surveyor  
Of frosted flake wood  
He tried to sell hesitation wherever he could  
"Buy some doubt"  
Feel free he yelled loud  
"Friends it won't hurt"  
Luckily there was big bird  
For God's sake run away  
Or it won't be your lucky day  
Leave this forest behind  
This ain't a place for human kind

I tried to feel your heartbeat, but I failed  
If I'd be more convincing you would stay  
But now it's time to stop the lies  
To go and walk away  
  
You tried to feel my heartbeat, but you failed  
If you'd be more convincing I would stay  
We left a while ago but now  
We can no longer fake  
  
We're moving empty boxes, what a waste  
We're moving empty thoughts, oh what a shame  
'Cause this is not a home for us, just sheer  
Waste of energy my dear  
  
We tried to feel a heartbeat, but we failed  
If we'd been more convincing we would stay  
This house is not a home for us  
Just sheer waste of energy  
My dear

You say this, you say that  
Smart but in a way you're sad  
Leave me alone right now  
I used to be in love with this  
Now I'm trying to get rid of all this human interest  
  
Don't you dare to point your finger at me  
Look at yourself  
I'm not the one you want me to be  
Look at yourself  
  
Some say no, some say yes  
Less or more or more or less  
Leave me alone right now  
  
I used to be adored each day  
Now it's time for me to pay  
The dreadful price of success  
  
Don't you dare to point your finger at me  
Look at yourself  
I'm not the one you want me to be  
Look at yourself  
  
Some say no, some say yes  
  
Don't you dare to point your finger at me  
Look at yourself  
I'm not the one you want me to be  
Look at yourself  
  
Don't you dare to point your finger at me  
Look at yourself  
I'm not the one you want me to be  
Look at yourself

Water falling down a hundred meters  
Colored by the sun  
In rainbow colors  
Paul is driving me around  
Through fields of light  
Blinded by the sun  
Fight the clouds  
Be an inhaler  
Have no doubts  
  
Let them take you on a voyage to another  
Let them take you on a voyage to another

As I was saying, stereo is full of surprises  
A new stereophonic sound spectacular  
A new stereophonic sound spectacular  
  
We're able to tell, in an instant, where a particular sound is coming from  
A new stereophonic sound spectacular [Repeat x5]  
As I was saying, stereo is full of surprises

Feel the need to wonder  
Inside  
Fulfill your basic needs  
Deep inside  
We wander by the lake of tears  
And smell the odor of our fear  
Inside  
Deep inside  
All these creepy things crawling  
Deep inside  
Feel the urge to grow  
Inside  
Our world is covered with clouds  
Deep inside  
We wander by our ocean of tears  
We try to hide our frozen fear  
Inside  
Deep inside  
All these creepy things crawling  
Deep inside

Longing for winter  
Longing for cold  
Bike ride through the snow  
Blinded by darkness  
Summer flows to the cemetery slow  
  
Pink versus black  
Black versus magenta  
This picture of you  
Just melts in my agenda  
While seasons change you know  
Yes, the season change you know  
With the flow  
  
Days just shorten  
Days just glow  
This fire keeps us warm  
While this storm will uncover  
Our secret place called  
The cemetery dawn  
  
Pink versus black  
Black versus magenta  
This picture of you  
Just melts in my agenda  
While seasons change you know  
Yes, season change you know  
With the flow

Sin is so much more than poetry  
Better start to pray  
Crime is sensual  
Softly breathing down your neck  
Flooded chemistry  
  
A tempting sign  
Is showing us  
A glimpse of alchemy  
The curtain drops  
Whenever we do try  
To react as if we're one  
  
Poisoned arrow softly piercing my heart  
With poetry  
Watching the sunrise  
My eyes closing fast  
Swallowed by the sea  
  
A tempting sign  
Is showing us  
A glimpse of alchemy  
The curtain drops  
Whenever we do try  
To react as if we're one  
  
One music doll stops rotating, breaking  
Her song lingers on  
Translating  
  
A tempting sign  
Is showing us  
A glimpse of alchemy  
The curtain drops  
Whenever we do try  
To react as if we're one

Please come back to me  
My child  
Things weren't meant to be  
Without tears we cry  
Even though we new  
It did strike  
But this ain't no dream  
No, this is life  
  
And all the colours fade  
Leaving nothing more  
Than a black and white shade on an empty  
Shore, a part is gone  
And sure we do long  
But black and white is so much more than nothing  
Oh nothing, at all  
  
Please come back to me  
Please come back to me  
My child  
Yes, we do control a lot  
Yes, we do control too much  
Overwhelmed by disbelieve  
Left in shock  
Still our disbelieve is the  
Remaining lock  
  
And all the colours fade  
Leaving nothing more  
Than a black and white shade on an empty  
Shore, a part is gone  
And sure we do long  
But black and white is so much more than nothing  
Oh nothing, at all

This shower will beam us to  
A blue changing too yellow scenery  
Bus noises all day long  
They make you whisper fragile words  
Losing energy  
  
And do we belong here  
You've got this Dave Berry effect on me  
Don't worry  
This formula one race  
Won't change our space station  
  
Apollo in Germany  
You frightened me to death when you fell out of your bed  
A bladder can hurt so much  
Especially with a Berlin neon hospital touch  
  
And do we belong here  
You've got this Dave Berry effect on me  
Don't worry  
This formula one race  
Won't change our space station  
  
And do we belong here  
You've got this Dave Berry effect on me  
Don't worry  
This formula one race  
Won't change our space station  
  
And do we belong here  
You've got this Dave Berry effect on me  
Don't worry  
This formula one race  
Won't change our space station

Concentrate, you're on the middle  
Of this one way ride  
In the center lays the key  
To get back off to a while  
If you can't solve this riddle  
I'm afraid you'll have to stay  
In the ???  
Of underestimated betrayal  
  
See them point in your direction  
See the indifference in their eyes  
Just living in oblivion  
Struggling with too many wires  
So you've got to solve this riddle  
Other wise you won't get back  
So if I were you  
I would concentrate on the morbid one way track

Tell me why  
Do you always forgive the things I do to you  
You're too good  
Or am I not too bad  
Those six years  
Were the best that ever happened to me and you  
No regrets after all this fear  
  
We'll always be best friends  
Something between you and me  
We'll always be best friends  
Something between you and me  
  
So tell me why  
I can't find any satisfaction somewhere else  
Not good enough  
Or am I way too bad  
Cause those six years  
I consumed all your energy  
And I didn't replace  
Sad enough  
I can't give you what you need  
  
We'll always be best friends  
Something between you and me  
We'll always be best friends  
Something between you and me  
We'll always be best friends  
Something between you and me  
We'll always be best friends  
Something between you and me  
  
Six years  
Such a long time  
I can't give you what you need  
Six years  
Such a long time  
Something special between you and me  
You and me  
  
We'll always be best friends  
Something between you and me  
We'll always be best friends  
Something between you and me  
We'll always be best friends  
Something between you and me  
We'll always be best friends  
Something between you and me

Overwhelming as they are  
Breeding hope by counting stars  
Merge the bitterness the pain  
Which I'm sure  
You can explain again  
  
One gets hurt when she feels small  
(And she's longing for some peace )  
Being the center of it all  
(Slow attack but fast release )  
Hear the difference in vain  
Out of tune but just not quite the same  
  
Overwhelming as they are  
(With their mystifying glow )  
Breeding hope by counting stars  
(As they hunger for the show )  
Hear the difference in vain  
Out of tune but just not quite the same

Electro screens of light  
And poppy-colored brights  
I'm floating on air  
Pink fluffy dinosaurs  
Tremendously hardcore  
I'm floating again  
This fake fir place  
Won't warm my soul nor face  
But still I'm floating  
Again  
Hypnosis releases brakes  
Make you do things you usually fake  
It makes you float  
Again  
Those bitten by the wild  
Will live on  
But those who used to bite  
Have gone  
Golden mirror on the wall  
Will make our lives less dull  
We'll be floating through the day  
All our money's almost gone  
But still we live the life we want  
We are floating through the day  
Those bitten by the wild  
Will live on  
But those who used to bite  
Have gone

It enters your veins  
It enters your soul  
Tries to obsess you  
It looks for defaults  
Try not to lose, not to lose control  
Try not to lose, not to lose control  
  
It tries to destroy you  
It tries to tear you down  
Am I lost,  
Lost in your backyard?  
Feel the pain  
Yellow takes over  
Yellow takes over  
Yellow takes over  
  
Try not to lose, not to lose control  
Try not to lose, not to lose control  
Try not to lose, not to lose control  
Try not to lose, not to lose control  
  
It enters your veins  
it enters your soul  
Tries to obsess you  
it looks for defaults  
Try not to lose, not to lose control  
Try not to lose, not to lose control  
  
It tries to destroy you  
It tries to tear you down  
Am I lost,  
Lost in your backyard?  
Feel the pain  
Yellow takes over  
Yellow takes over  
Yellow takes over  
  
Try not to lose, not to lose control

Sweet relief calms me down  
Makes me drown lost and found  
Neighbours complain sheets are stained  
Hotel shower the best around  
Spacing from Paris to new york  
Silver sunglasses silver phone  
Connect us to someone who doesn't know  
About these feelings we can't control  
People they want us to fall down  
But we won't ever touch the ground  
We're perfectly balanced we'll float around  
'Til no one is near do you hear this sound  
Spacing from Paris to new york  
Silver sunglasses silver phone  
Connect us to someone who doesn't know  
About these feelings we can't control  
This strange feeling captures us it generates this huge fuzz  
I miss you all the time I must face I miss your touch and your embrace

Small groove thing invades my veins  
Soul deserts and leaves this chain  
Here she's coming to me  
Revolver excludes this community  
  
Small groove thing take off my chains  
Hoover will soften my pain  
Here she's coming to you  
Floating on a white caribou  
  
Small groove thing invades my veins  
Soul deserts and leaves this chain  
Small groove thing take off my chains  
Hoover will soften my pain  
  
Here she's coming to me  
Revolver excludes this community  
Here she's coming to you  
Floating on a white caribou

Suffocate your love  
In a barrel full of doubt  
Suffocate your love  
North east and south  
  
Here I stand  
In front of your imagination  
Here I stand  
  
Hesitate, it's normal  
You can't erase mistakes  
Hesitate, it's normal  
I can't keep awake  
  
Here I stand  
In front of your imagination  
Here I stand  
  
Come closer  
It's you I want to embrace  
Come closer  
It's you I want to debase  
  
Here I stand  
In front of your imagination  
Here I stand

I'm not going down on my knees  
Begging you to adore me  
Can you see it's misery  
And torture for me  
When I'm missunderstood  
Try as hard as you can  
I've tried the hardest I could  
To make you see  
How important it is for me  
Here is a plea  
From my heart to you  
Nobody knows me  
As well as you do  
You know how hard it is for me  
To shake the disease  
That takes hold of my tongue in situations like these  
Understand me  
  
Some people have to be  
Permanently together  
Lovers devoted to each other forever  
Now I've got things to do  
And I've said before  
That I know you have too  
When I'm not there  
In spirit I'll be there  
Here is a plea  
From my heart to you  
Nobody knows me  
As well as you do  
You know how important is for me  
To shake the disease  
That takes hold of my tongue in situations like these  
Understand me  
  
Here is a plea  
From my heart to you  
Nobody knows me  
As well as you do  
You know how hard it is for me  
  
To shake the disease  
That takes hold of my tongue in situations like these

You're the shampoo in my eyes  
You are the salt in my wounds  
A necessity in life  
But always in the wrong place  
  
You're the thorn in my side  
You ache and ache and ache  
Still I can't live without  
You will be in me  
  
You're the warmth and the ice  
Not knowing what to do  
Should you laugh or should you cry  
You lead me to the wrong place  
  
You're the thorn in my side  
You ache and ache and ache  
Still I can't live without  
You will be in me

And through all Alex's wondrous  
Childhood he would honor and obey  
Love and watch the lovely maiden  
On whose gentle arms he just lay  
All men all must be mild obedient  
All men all must be mild obedient  
As good as he  
  
And through all Alex's wondrous  
Childhood he would honor and obey

All men all must be mild obedient  
As good as he  
  
And All men all must be mild obedient  
And All men all must be mild obedient

Why don't you ever get the point  
You're much too slow for me  
Why don't we ever flip our coin  
Reliability  
  
Some like it a lot  
Just give a little to me  
That's why I sing this song  
  
They call us crazy early birds  
Too early never hurts  
Warmth is not as dangerous as  
As dangerous as those words  
  
Some like it a lot  
Just give a little to me  
That's why I sing this song  
  
Sometimes  
We've got to sing this song  
Sometimes  
It takes us way too long  
Sometimes  
We've got to sing out of key  
  
Winter never gets me down  
It's just a feeling  
Feeling fine  
To care for you or not to care  
A god damned thin thin line  
  
Some like it a lot  
Just give a little to me  
That's why I sing this song  
  
Sometimes  
We've got to sing this song  
Sometimes  
It takes us way too long  
Sometimes  
We've got to sing out of key  
We've got to sing  
  
Why don't you ever get the point  
You're much too slow for me  
Why don't we ever flip our coin  
Probably a lack of reliability  
  
Sometimes  
We've got to sing this song  
Sometimes  
It takes us way too long  
Sometimes  
We've got to sing out of key  
  
Sometimes  
We've got to sing this song  
Sometimes  
It takes us way too long  
Sometimes  
We've got to sing out of key  
We've got to sing this song  
  
Sometimes  
We've got to sing this song  
Sometimes  
It takes us way too long

I ring your bell,  
The buzzer opens the door.  
As I walk in, I only mind the floor.  
  
I raise my head and I see  
A shadow on the wall,  
Vibrantly,  
Reminding your last call.  
  
[Chorus:]  
You are lying on the floor,  
Trying to remember,  
What happened the night before.  
  
Step by step,  
The sound of breaking glass.  
What happened here, well I can only guess.  
  
You seem asleep,  
As I try to put you on the bed,  
As I find traces of regret.  
  
[Chorus:]  
You are lying on the floor,  
Trying to remember,  
What happened the night before.  
You, are you really that sure,  
That I'm the prince who'll wake you.  
  
We can't rewind the movie called our life.  
And though I'm your hero,  
I'm not that sure, so unsure I'll save  
You are lying on the floor,  
Trying to remember  
  
[Chorus:]  
You are lying on the floor,  
Trying to remember,  
What happened the night before.  
You, are you really that sure,  
That I'm the prince who'll wake you.

[Chorus: x2]  
You've got this strange effect on me  
And I like it  
  
You make my world in white  
You make my darkness bright, oh yes  
You've got this strange effect on me  
And I like it, and I like it  
  
And I like the way you kiss me  
Don't know if I should  
But this feeling it's love and I know it  
That's why I feel good  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
You make my world in white  
You make my darkness bright, oh yes  
You've got this strange effect on me  
And I like it, and I like it

It all comes down to winning, but defeat is no shame  
Why do you lose interest when there's nothing more to gain  
'Cause evil attracts, but our love will be a fact  
Tomorrow  
Tomorrow  
  
'Cause time is up  
And so are we  
But still there's a chance to avoid defeat  
Tomorrow  
Tomorrow  
Tomorrow  
Tomorrow  
  
Just a little more effort do try to succeed  
There's nothing in life that's impossible to beat  
'Cause evil attracts, but our love will be a fact  
Tomorrow

'Cause time is up  
And so are we  
But still there's a chance to avoid defeat

I...like the things that you hate  
And you...hate the things that I like  
But it hurts  
Honesty's your church  
But sometimes  
It's better to lie  
I...am the vinegar and salt  
And you...are the oil that dissolves  
My frustration  
Honesty's limitation  
But sometimes  
It's better to lie  
I am the vinegar and salt  
And you are the oil that dissolves my frustrations  
Limitations  
But sometimes...  
I don't dare to ask why

Accepting new ideas is hard  
Holding on to the past  
It's too easy can't you see  
We've got to move on  
  
Our world is constantly speeding  
The stars are still intriguing  
The tears in our eyes  
Feed happiness for the next miles  
  
These visions make us desperate  
Give us hope  
The end is always the start of a  
New episode  
Feel free to interact with the plot  
The choice can really mean a lot  
Just try to translate this secret code  
  
These prophecies are frightening  
Evoke artificial lightning  
Watch out cause it can strike you  
The remedy is inside you  
  
These visions make us desperate  
Give us hope  
The end is always the start of a  
New episode feel free to interact with the plot  
The choice can really mean a lot  
Just try to translate this secret code  
  
These visions make us desperate  
Give us hope  
The end is always the start of a  
New episode  
  
Feel free to interact with the plot  
Your choice can really mean a lot  
Just try to  
Just try to  
Just try to translate this

You're the needle  
In my veins  
Pleasure mostly  
Ends in pain  
  
Temptation is a part of us  
But us is driving me insane  
Now it's time to make decisions  
Yes ain't easy but no's too safe  
  
Wake up  
Don't tell me what do  
Wake up  
Don't tell me what to say  
Wake up  
But there's one thing you can tell  
Wake up  
And that's how I'd feel  
When there's no more you  
When there's no more you  
  
We don't need no competition  
In the end this is no game  
Deliver me your best and I will  
Give you what is left of me  
  
Excuses are the final drop  
Excuses don't relieve the pain  
Solitude ain't so bad  
When there's nothing left for us to gain  
  
Wake up  
Don't tell me what do  
Wake up  
Don't tell me what to say  
Wake up  
But there's one thing you can tell  
Wake up  
And that's how I'd feel  
When there's no more you  
No more you  
You  
No more you  
You  
  
You're the needle  
In my veins  
Pleasure mostly  
Ends in pain  
Nothing left for  
Us to gain  
  
Wake up  
Don't tell me what do  
Wake up  
Don't tell me what to say  
Wake up  
But there's one thing you can tell  
Wake up  
And that's how I'd feel  
When there's no more you  
When there's no more you  
When there's no more you  
When there's no more you  
When there's no more you

Tell me baby  
where did you sleep last night  
  
I heard noises in the cupboard were you trying to hide  
Because you should know  
How much I hate this  
If you were I'll hit your hiding place  
Until sunrise  
And I'm falling in love  
And I'm falling in love  
Cause I need your loving  
Everyday and every night  
And I'm falling in love  
Tell me baby where did you sleep last night  
I heard noises in the cupboard were you trying to hide  
Because you should know  
How much I hate this  
If you were I'll hit your hiding place  
Until sunrise  
And I'm falling in love  
And I'm falling in love  
Cause I need your loving  
Everyday and every night  
And I'm falling in love

These gigantic waves just take me  
To an unknown destination  
Under the moonlight  
Feel free to join me on my trip  
The tide will take us far  
Beyond midnight  
Stars will guide us through this  
Exotic white  
Stars won't be able to fool the knowledge  
Of the magic dice  
This sea breeze is refreshing  
While the dolphins sing about  
These psychedelic moods  
These waves keep you going  
'Til you finally forget  
Your original roots  
Stars will guide us through this  
Exotic white  
Stars won't be able to fool the knowledge  
Of the magic dice  
Wave after wave

The wind is telling stories about us  
Writing words with sand and powder dust  
Deserted squares and lonesome trees  
The wind revealing stories about us  
  
Fall is telling stories about us  
Writing words with leaves and powder dust  
Multi-coloured lanes of trees  
Mesmerising stories about us  
  
We all float  
Clouds of gold  
The mountains make the sun arise  
Your rainbow coloured eyes can change the tide  
  
We all float  
Clouds of gold  
The mountains make the sun arise  
Your rainbow coloured eyes can change the tide  
  
The river telling stories about us  
Writing words with water full of lust  
Yellow purple green or blue  
Drip by drip revealing things on you  
  
We all float  
Clouds of gold  
The mountains make the sun arise  
Your rainbow coloured eyes can change the tide  
  
We all float  
Clouds of gold  
The mountains make the sun arise  
Your rainbow coloured eyes can change the tide  
  
Mountains make the sun arise  
Your rainbow coloured eyes can change the tide

I must have been blind adoring the blues  
In everything lies a small kind of truth  
But than again,  
Just when I thought you were staying for good  
You left for no reason, was that all you could  
You're still a man  
  
It's not what I want  
It's not what I need  
Nothing but lies and way too much heat  
Just when I thought you were telling the truth  
I caught you with her, oh you fool  
  
You hurt me  
When I've got so much more to give  
You hurt me  
When I've got so much more to give  
  
We live in denial, adoring what's new  
In everything lies a small kind of blues  
But than again,  
Just when I thought you were leaving for good  
You stayed for no reason although we were through  
You're still a man  
  
It's not what I want  
It's not what I need  
Nothing but lies and way too much heat  
Just when I thought you were telling the truth  
I caught you with her, oh you fool  
  
You hurt me  
When I've got so much more to give  
You hurt me  
When I've got so much more to give  
  
But then again,  
It's not what I want  
It's not what I need  
Nothing but lies and way too much heat  
Just when I thought you were telling the truth  
I caught you with her, oh you fool  
  
You hurt me  
When I've got so much more to give  
You hurt me  
When I've got so much more to give  
  
An' everytime again,  
You hurt me  
When I've got so much more to give  
  
Everytime again,  
You hurt me  
When I've got so much more to give  
  
But then again,  
You hurt me  
When I've got so much more to give

Face your faith  
Remove all the lace  
You love me to death  
But death may love you more  
  
You paint with glaze  
But write me without grace  
You love me to death  
Our love was mortal hope  
  
Oh you love me to death  
But death may love you more  
  
You grow in me  
And although we disagree  
You love me to death  
You can not love me more  
  
The best things in life to find  
Will not always satisfy  
You can love me to death  
But I will have to go  
  
Oh you love me to death  
But I will have to go  
  
Oh you love me to death  
But I will have to go  
  
Oh you love me to death  
But I will have to go
