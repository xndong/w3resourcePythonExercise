With the music of life, my soul is out of tune,  
And I feel like I'm growing old much too soon,  
My love for you, I just couldn't convey,  
And the keys to my happiness, I let slip away.  
Now I'm a man without a dream,  
I've got a heart that has no hope,  
All my senses are numb,  
Losing you, I've become,  
A man (I'm just a man) without a dream.  
Instead of striving to reach my goals and my aims  
I got distracted with meaningless games,  
For just an illusion, I traded love that was real,  
Now my eyes cannot see and my heart cannot feel.  
Now I'm a man without a dream,  
I've got a heart that has no hope,  
All my senses are numb,  
Losing you, I've become,  
A man (I'm just a man) without a dream.  
Sometimes I think I'm a prisoner of fate,  
Doomed to find out things a little too late,  
And so I must play this broken man's role,  
Unless you come home, girl, and bring back my soul.  
'Cause I'm a man without a dream,  
I've got a heart that has no hope,  
All my senses are numb,  
Losing you, I've become,  
A man (I'm just a man) without a dream,  
Without a dream,  
Without a dream.  

Acapulco sun, leaving work undone  
Dream about the nighttime till she comes  
She'll take my hand and walk with me  
Down along the sea  
Hear the pretty song she sings for free  
She sings songs of love so sweet (oh so sweet)  
And the words she's saying are so simple and complete  
"I love you, truly do."  
  
Acapulco sun, tells me she's the one  
Dream about the sunset till she comes  
She'll take my hand and walk with me  
Down along the sea  
Hear the pretty song she sings for free  
She sings songs of love so sweet (oh so sweet)  
And the words she's saying are so simple and complete  
"I love you, truly do."  
  
Acapulco sun, leaving work undone  
Dream about the night time till she comes

You're selling ads you slimy toad  
Don't smile at me and shake my hand  
You're killing me  
You're killing us  
Because you're only  
'Only selling ads'  
  
You're selling ads you stupid twit  
The naked lunch is on your knife  
The homicides are suicides  
Because you're only  
'Only selling ads'  
  
Your copy kills  
Your copy smells  
Realities are crushed beneath the ads your copy sells  
  
Go back to hell you giddy fools  
There is no truth you cannot maim  
He killed himself  
You killed him first  
Because you're only  
'Only selling ads'  
  
Your copy kills  
Your copy smells  
Realities are crushed beneath the ads your copy sells  
  
You're selling ads you slimy toad  
Don't smile at me and shake my hand  
You're killing me  
You're killing us  
Because you're only  
'Only selling ads'  
  
Because you're only 'only selling ads'  
Because you're only 'only selling ads'  
Because you're only 'only selling ads'

I can see you when the moon is shining bright  
I can feel you when the moon is out of sight  
Whisper softly, well it sounds so nice  
All alone in the dark, all alone in the dark  
  
I can hear the words you whisper when you're near  
I can feel them tickle softly in my ear  
Kiss me softly while there's no one here  
All alone in the dark, all alone in the dark  
  
You know this darkness makes me see  
That you're the only one for me  
You know this darkness makes me see  
And this time's the only time  
We can make our feelings rhyme  
With all the things we could not say  
  
I can see you when the moon is shining bright  
I can feel you when the moon is out of sight  
Whisper softly, well it sounds so nice  
All alone in the dark, all alone in the dark  
All alone in the dark

Once upon a once in a while  
It's hard to remember to smile  
Just like all of your toys  
Can't you see I don't want to play  
I don't need it  
Can't you say you want me to stay  
I'd believe it  
Just like all of your toys  
  
[Chorus]  
When all of your play things  
Someday disappear  
Girl, will you be happy  
With nothing but tears?  
With nothing but tears?  
  
Once upon a once in a while  
It's hard to remember to smile,  
Just like all of your toys  
Don't you ever feel kind of sad?  
Cause you're lonely  
Think about the love that we had  
Are you lonely?  
Just like all of your toys  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ah  
Just like all of your toys, I don't want to be  
Just like all of your toys, I don't need to be  
Just like all of your, just like all of your toys  
I should have known I'd be alone  
No, no, no I don't need it  
Oh, don't you have me believe it  
Just like all of your toys

All the king's horse and all the king's men  
They couldn't put my broken heart back together again.  
I woke up this mornin' that this is what I found.  
You had gone and left me,  
Any you never even made a farewell sound.  
  
All the king's horse and all the king's men  
They couldn't put my broken heart back together again.  
I asked my friends about you and this is what they said,  
"She can live without you,  
She's gonna find a man with money instead."  
  
All the king's horse and all the king's men  
They couldn't put my broken heart back together again.  
Someday you will know, the meaning of a love that's true.  
But when you find out I won't be around to share it with you.  
  
All the king's horse and all the king's men  
They couldn't put my broken heart back together again.  
All the king's horse and all the king's men  
They couldn't put my broken heart back together again.

By Michael Nesmith  
My latest sun is sinking fast,  
My race is nearly run,  
My strongest trials now have passed,  
My triumph is begun.  
Oh, come, angel band,  
Come and around me, stand,  
Oh, bear me away on your snow-white wings  
To my immortal home,  
Oh, bear me away on your snow-white wings  
To my immortal home.  
Oh, bear my longing heart to Him  
Who bled and died for me,  
Whose blood now cleanses from all sin  
And brings me victory.  
Oh, come, angel band,  
Come and around me, stand,  
Oh, bear me away on your snow-white wings  
To my immortal home,  
Oh, bear me away on your snow-white wings  
To my immortal home.  
Oh, come, angel band,  
Come and around me, stand,  
Oh, bear me away on your snow-white wings  
To my immortal home,  
Oh, bear me away on your snow-white wings  
To my immortal home.  
Oh, come, angel band,  
Come and around me, stand,  
Oh, bear me away on your snow-white wings  
To my immortal home,  
Oh, bear me away on your snow-white wings  
To my immortal home.  
Fade out...  

CHORUS:  
Anytime, anyplace, anywhere,  
I'll never forget what we shared.  
Comes a day there's a knock on my door,  
I hope that you'll be standing there.  
I'll wonder what you'll say if we meet  
On the street one day years from now.  
Maybe you'll need time to recall,  
Oh, but I won't need anytime at all.  
Now I guess we've come from circle  
Cause we're parting as friends.  
CHORUS  
Love can make the tears in the rain,  
And the brightest flame can fade away.  
When you look into the eyes of a friend,  
There's a feeling in your heart that will never end.  
After all the songs I sang you,  
There's no doubt in my mind.  
CHORUS  
Another road's ahead of me, the night moves on.  
This heart never lies, these tears in my eyes say carry on.  
CHORUS  
Any day, any week, any month any year,  
I'll never forget what we shared.  
Comes a day there's a knock on my door,  
I hope that you'll be standing there.  
  

I can tell by your face  
That you're looking to find a place  
To settle your mind  
And reveal who you are  
And you shouldn't be shy  
For I'm not gonna try  
To hurt you or heal you or steal your star  
Open your eyes  
Get up off your chair  
There's so much to do in the sunlight  
Give up your secrets  
Let down your hair  
And sit with me here by the firelight  
Why think all about  
Who's gonna win out  
We'll make up our story as we go along  
There's so little time  
For us to try to rhyme  
And so many highways to travel upon  
Open your eyes  
Get up off your chair  
There's so much to do in the sunlight  
Give up your secrets and let down your hair  
And sit with me here by the firelight

Bye bye, baby, bye bye  
Don't want to make you cry  
Bye bye, baby, bye bye  
Don't want to make you cry  
I'll be leaving you now  
You'll get along somehow  
Time time is gone when you and I were strong  
Time time is gone when you and I were strong  
Isn't easy to leave, isn't easy to leave  
  
You spend you life thinking about living  
You spend your whole life  
  
Bye bye baby bye bye  
Don't want to make you cry  
  
Time time time is gone when you and I were strong  
Time time time is gone when you and I were strong  
Isn't easy to leave, isn't easy to leave  
  
You spend your time sitting there thinking  
Thinking about sitting there thinking  
You waste my time talking about dying  
Dying when you should be trying  
Bye bye, baby, bye bye  
Don't want to make you cry  
Bye bye, baby, bye bye  
Don't want to make you cry  
I'll be leaving you now  
You'll get along somehow  
  
Time time time is mine to make my fortune mine  
Time time time is mine to make my fortune mine  
Can't say I can see what'll happen to me  
Can't say I can see what'll happen to me  
Bye bye baby bye bye

Circle sky  
Telling lies  
Here I stand  
At demand  
  
And it looks we've made it once again  
And it looks we've made it once again  
  
Color sound  
All around  
Wing tip smile  
Sees for miles  
  
And it looks we've made it once again  
And it looks we've made it once again  
  
Its a very extraordinary scene  
To those who don't understand  
But what you have seen you must believe  
If you can  
If you can  
  
Hamilton  
Smiling down  
Telling more  
Than before  
  
And it looks we've made it once again  
And it looks we've made it once again  
Yes it looks like we've made it to the end

Come on in,  
You sure look good to me.  
Come on in,  
I've learned how lonely I can be.  
  
I guess we'll never know just what went wrong  
You know it's been a whole year has passed us by and gone.  
But we're back together now where we belong  
So, baby, come on in.  
  
Come on in,  
I heard your footstep on the stair.  
Come on in,  
I'd know it anywhere.  
  
Your old chair in the corner is justa sitting there waiting.  
It's been a long time anticipating.  
What a long time it's been.  
So, baby, come on in.  
  
Over and over I've told myself  
I said, "Son, you've got to lose these blues.  
Get ready for the day when she'll walk in the door."  
So I dusted off your housecoat and I polished up your shoes.  
  
Come on in,  
You know your welcome here.  
Aw, come on in,  
It's been a long, long year.  
  
Now I know why I waited around  
I wouldn't run around town, let them put me down.  
I knew that if I waited I would win.  
So, baby, come on in.  
  
Come on in,  
Come on in,  
Aw, come in.

Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two  
One of these days I'll be back with you  
Counting the ways that I love you  
Through and through  
  
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine  
Tentatively you put up the signs  
Letting me know you are mine  
  
And I'm counting on you  
To be here through it all  
I'm counting on you  
To catch me if I fall  
Whatever you do, remember  
I'm always counting on you  
  
Flight six, eight, one, gate forty-two  
At seven fifteen I'll feel ten feet tall  
Knowing you care after all  
  
And I'm counting on you  
To be here through it all  
I'm counting on you  
To catch me if I fall  
Whatever you do, remember  
I'm always counting on you  
  
Counting on you  
To be here through it all  
Counting on you  
To catch me if I fall  
Remember I'm always  
Counting on you

Well I married a wife in the month of June,  
Married her up by the light of the moon.  
We live down on Cripple Creek.  
We've been there about a week.  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm a-goin' down to Cripple Creek, I'm goin' on a run.  
Goin' down to Cripple Creek to have some fun.  
Goin' down to Cripple Creek, I'm goin' on a run.  
Goin' down to Cripple Creek to have some fun.  
  
Now Cripple Creek girl's about half-grown,  
Jump on a man like a dog on a bone.  
Roll my pants up to my knees,  
Cross on Cripple Creek a-when I please.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well I'm goin' to Cripple Creek, I'm goin' on a run.  
I'm a-goin' to Cripple Creek to have some fun.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm a-goin' to Cripple Creek, I'm goin' on a run,  
Goin' to Cripple Creek to have some fun.

You're not only cuddly toy that was ever enjoyed by any boy  
You're not the only choo-choo train that was left out in the rain  
The day after Santa came  
You're not the only cherry delight that was left out in the night  
And gave up without a fight  
You're not the only cuddly toy that was ever enjoyed by any boy  
  
You're not the kind of girl to tell your mother  
The kind of company you keep  
I never told you not to love no other  
You must of dreamed it in your sleep  
  
You're not only cuddly toy that was ever enjoyed by any boy  
You're not the only choo-choo train that was left out in the rain  
The day after Santa came  
You're not the only cherry delight that was left out in the night  
And gave up without a fight  
You're not the only cuddly toy that was ever enjoyed by any boy

Darkened, rolling figures move through prisms of no color  
Hand-in-hand, they walk the night  
But never know each other  
Passioned pastel neon lights light up the jeweled traveler  
Who, lost in scenes of smoke-filled dreams  
Find questions, but no answers  
  
Startled eyes that sometimes see phantasmagoric splendor  
Pirouette down palsied paths  
With pennies for the vendor  
Salvation's yours for just the time it takes to pay the dancer  
And once again such anxious men  
Find questions, but no answers  
  
The night has gone and taken it's infractions  
While saddened eyes hope there will be a next one  
  
Sahara signs look down upon a world that glitters glibly  
And mountain sides put arms around  
The unsuspecting city  
Second hands that minds have slowed are moving even faster  
Toward bringing down someone who's found  
The questions, but no answers

Well?  
Are you kidding? ha ha!  
Hey, now, wait a minute!  
  
Hey, hey, we are the Monkees  
You know we love to please  
A manufactured image  
With no philosophies  
  
We hope you like our story  
Although there isn't one  
That is to say, there's many  
That way there is more fun  
  
You told us you like action  
And games of many kinds  
You like to dance, we like to sing  
So let's all lose our minds  
  
We know it doesn't matter  
'cause what you came to see  
Is what we'd love to give you  
And give it one, two, three  
  
But it may come three, two, one, two  
Or jump from nine to five  
And when you see the end in sight  
The beginning may arrive  
  
For those who look for meanings  
In form as they do fact  
We might tell you one thing  
But we'd only take it back  
  
Not back like in a box, back  
Not back like in a race  
Not back so we can keep it  
But back in time and space  
  
You say we're manufactured  
To that we all agree  
So make your choice and we'll rejoice  
In never being free  
  
Hey, hey, we are the Monkees  
We've said it all before  
The money's in, we're made of tin  
We're here to give you more  
  
We want the Monkees  
  
Give me a "w"  
Give me an "a"  
Give me an "r"  
What does it spell?

You could make it all so easy. (Aaah)  
Girl you know just how to please me. (Aaah)  
Don't you do it if you think you got to. (Aaah)  
Don't you do it cause you think you ought to. (Aaah)  
  
Ooh, do it in the name of love.  
If you really want me that's reason enough.  
Do it in the name of love. (do it in the name)  
Do it in the name of love.  
  
Baby, ain't it good to go together? (Aaah)  
I swear it feels just like forever. (Aaah)  
Hmmm don't be scared and don't you worry, no (Aaah)  
It's all right, there's no hurry.(Aaah) Oh no.  
  
Ooh, do it in the name of love.  
If you really want me that's reason enough.  
Do it in the name of love. (do it in the name)  
Do it in the name of love.  
  
Do it in the name of love.  
If you really want me that's reason enough.  
Do it in the name of love. (do it in the name)  
Do it in the name of love.  
  
Do it in the name of love.  
If you really want me that's reason enough.  
Do it in the name of love. (do it in the name)  
Do it in the name of love.

I'm like a toy balloon  
And someone cruel has cut the string  
I'm drifting out of sight  
My head's too light to find a thing  
Oh baby, life is like a cartoon movie  
Being with you makes it groovy  
Everything you do is new to me  
  
And do you feel it too?  
Do you find another joy in every little thing you do?  
Oh do you feel it too, do you find the only thing  
That matters now is me and you?  
  
I can't believe my ears  
You know I hear such crazy sounds  
Each time I talk to you  
And walk with you I'm off the ground  
Oh baby, love is great, you just can't top it  
Got the ball we mustn't drop it  
Girl there ain't a thing can stop it now  
  
And do you feel it too?  
Do you find another joy in every little thing you do?  
Oh do you feel it too, do you find the only thing  
That matters now is me and you?  
Tell me baby  
  
Oh baby, life is like a cartoon movie  
Being with you makes it groovy  
Everything you do is new to me  
  
And do you feel it too?  
Do you find another joy in every little thing you do?  
Oh do you feel it too, do you find the only thing  
That matters now is me and you?

Don't call on me  
When you're feelin' footloose  
And fancy free,  
You've done that before,  
And like a fool I  
Came back for more  
  
It's all over now  
I've finally seen my way  
I need you no more  
Not now or any other day.  
  
Okay little girl,  
Live for yourself in your own little world.  
I know that you'll find  
Someone who'll play at love  
Be just your kind  
Be just your kind

Walking around with your head in the clouds  
You don't care  
Why must you walk when you know  
You're not going anywhere  
  
[Chorus]  
Why don't you come out of your dream world  
It's not real  
It's not the way it seems to be  
Why don't you come into the real world  
Come with me  
We'll share our thoughts, forget the dreams  
You'll see  
  
Always pretending that everything's fine  
When it's not  
Why must you lie when you know that  
You'll always get caught  
  
[Chorus x2]  
  
You'll see  
You'll see

I told my Doctor something's wrong with me  
She said gimme forty dollars and we'll look and see  
Hop up on the table now we'll take some blood  
Find out what you're dyin' of  
  
She called me in the morning and she said now here are the facts  
Well, it isn't your liver and it isn't your back  
It's not your blood sugar or the Asian flu  
That's not what killing you  
  
You're dyin' of a broken heart  
It really wasn't very smart  
You lived through Nixon and a drug or two  
Just to get your due  
Dyin' of a broken heart  
  
I called my analyst said I was a mess  
He said gimme hundred dollars and we'll take a test  
Lie down on the couch and tell me what you dream  
It really isn't what it seems  
  
You're dyin'  
You're dyin' of a broken heart  
And I'm cryin'  
It really wasn't very smart  
I lived through Nixon and a drug or two  
Just to get your due  
Dyin' of a broken heart  
  
You're dyin'  
You're dyin' of a broken heart  
And I'm cryin'  
It really wasn't very smart  
I lived through Nixon and a drug or two  
Just to get your due  
Dyin' of a broken heart  
  
You're dyin' of a broken heart  
It really wasn't very smart  
I lived through Nixon and a drug or two  
Just to get your due  
Dyin' of a broken heart  
(Get your due)  
Dyin' of a broken heart  
(Get your due)  
Dyin' of a broken heart  
Dyin'  
Dyin'  
Dyin'

A distant night bird mocks the sun.  
I wake as I have always done,  
To freshly scented sycamore  
And cold bare feet on hardwood floor.  
My steaming coffee warms my face  
I'm disappointed in the taste.  
But there's a peace the early brings  
The morning world of growing things.  
  
I feel the moments hurry on  
It was today, it's died away,  
And now it is forever gone.  
And I will drink my coffee slow  
And I will watch my shadow grow  
And disappear in firelight  
And sleep alone again tonight.

Love is understanding,  
Don't you know that this is true.  
Love is understanding,  
It's in everything we do.  
  
In this generation,  
In this lovin' time,  
In this generation,  
We will make the world shine.  
  
We were born to love one another  
This is something we all need.  
We were born to love one another  
We must be what we're goin' to be  
And what we have to be is free.  
  
In this generation,  
In this lovin' time,  
In this generation,  
We will make the world shine.  
  
We were born to love one another  
This is something we all need.  
We were born to love one another  
We must be what we're goin' to be  
And what we have to be is free.  
  
Love is understanding, we gotta be free  
Love is understanding, we gotta be free

Forget that girl,  
She'll only make you sad someday.  
Forget that girl,  
  
She'll never make you happy.  
Stay away from her, my friend,  
Stay away from her.  
  
Forget that girl,  
She'll only bring you down again.  
Forget that girl,  
She'll only make you lonely.  
Stay away from her, my friend,  
Stay away from her.  
  
There was a time when she could really love you  
When she was thinking only of you  
But now she's thrown herself above you  
And there's nothing you can do.  
  
Forget that girl,  
Even tho you find it's hard.  
Forget that girl,  
Even though you love her.  
  
She's in love with him, my friend,  
She's in love with him.  
Oh yeah, she's in love with him.......

A little girl  
Goes out walking in the night  
A little boy  
Calls, "Good evening"  
From the light  
They stop to talk for just a while  
Then she's gone  
  
A little girl  
Sits beside her window pane  
Thinking about an evening in the rain  
A little talk, a little boy  
Then she's gone  
  
A little girl  
Goes out walking  
Once again  
A little boy  
Finds that he has done the same  
They stop to talk for just a while  
Then they're gone

There's a smile on the wind as it touches my face  
And starts to erase all the gloom  
And the sun with a kiss, begins to dismiss the  
Memory of my life without you  
Well it seems like yesterday that my path took me away  
Although I know it's been at least a year  
But now my path heads home  
And your patient time alone  
Has brought me even closer to you, dear  
  
And this plane gets closer  
Every minute I look down to a watch that keeps looking back at me  
And it says to me, "Be patient son you've waited this long."  
How can I be strong?  
  
And this the plane gets closer  
Every minute I look down to watch that keeps looking back at me  
And it says to me, "Be patient son you've waited this long."  
How can I be strong?  
  
Well the plane is finally down  
And the engines stopped their sound  
And I look in the crowd and there you stand  
And the gap that once was time  
Is forever closed behind  
I told you I'd come back and here I am.

Love in a vacuum, love in a space,  
Love without even the little hint of a trace,  
Love in confusion then love doesn't show on your face.  
  
Love is a stranger, love is a box,  
Love is the key that fits a million locks,  
Love is a mystery when love is the devil you call.  
  
Put your heart and soul where I can see them shine,  
I wish you'd put your heart and soul where I can think they're mine,  
I wish you'd put your heart and soul where I can see them shine.  
  
Love at a distance, love at a walk,  
Love at the limit if only people could talk,  
Love for the moment it takes to its wings like a hawk.  
  
Love for tomorrow, love for today,  
Love for the hour it could be coming your way,  
Love for a puzzle you need a solution to play.  
  
Put your heart and soul where I can see them shine,  
I wish you'd put your heart and soul where I can think they're mine,  
I wish you'd put your heart and soul where I can see them shine,  
I wish you'd put your heart and soul where I can think they're mine.  
  
I wish you'd put your heart and soul where I can see them shine,  
I wish you'd put your heart and soul where I can think they're mine,  
I wish you'd put your heart and soul where I can see them shine,  
I wish you'd put your heart and soul where I can think they're mine,  
I wish you'd put your heart and soul where I can see them shine,  
I wish you'd put your heart and soul where I can think they're mine.  

The sun that's falling from the southwestern sky  
Tells me that I must depart,  
So, by sundown today, I'll be on my way,  
But I'll be leaving my heart.  
It's not the countryside that appealed to my eyes,  
It's the spirit and it captured my mind,  
But the things I tried to be made a wreck out of me,  
Now a different road, I must find.  
These things I think are new, I guess they're really old,  
It seems I've done 'em once before  
Now, to go back to that fork in the road,  
Takes all the strength of my soul and more.  
Oh, goodbye, goodbye you cruel town,  
You've been a fair-weather friend,  
Now I will go to some places that I know  
Where things don't start just to end.  
These things I think are new, I guess they're really old,  
It seems that I've done 'em once before,  
Now, to go back to that fork in the road,  
Takes all the strength of my soul and more.  
Oh, goodbye, good goodbye you cruel town,  
You've been a fair-weather friend,  
Now I will go to some place that I know  
Where things don't start just to end.

If you think I want the life you choose to live  
I don't think I want the love you've got to give  
If you think my goals could be so trivial and small  
Then, I don't think you know me at all  
Born between the covers of your fashion books  
You think you can make it, girl, on just your looks  
But you could never bring me up  
Between us stands a wall  
No, I don't think you know me at all  
Believing in the promise painted in your smile  
I've chased what I was running from, girl, all my life  
I've known you a hundred times in memories I recall, but  
I don't think you know me at all  
I don't think you know me at all.  

I one went with a belly dancer (Lum do dee ally day)  
One around I didn't stand a chance a (Lum do dee ally day)  
I, I, I love you better  
I, I, I love you better  
  
Then I went with a gospel singer (Lum do dee ally day)  
She tried to wrap me around her finger, now (Lum do dee ally day)  
But I say  
I, I, I love you better  
I, I, I love you better  
  
Ha, ha, ha, lum do dee ally day.  
Ha, ha, ha, lum do dee ally day.  
  
I once went with a history teacher (Lum do dee ally day)  
I really tried but I couldn't reach her (Lum do dee ally day)  
I, I, I love you better  
I, I, I love you better  
  
Well, let me tell you now  
I, I, I love you better  
I, I, I love you better  
  
Ha, ha, ha, lum do dee ally day  
Ha, ha, ha, lum do dee ally day  
  
There were some that I can't remember (Lum do dee ally day)  
Think I went with Miss November (Lum do dee ally day)  
But I say  
I, I, I love you better  
I, I, I love you better.

I wanna be free,  
Like the bluebirds flying by me,  
Like the waves out on the blue sea,  
If your love has to tie me,  
Don't try me, say good-bye.  
I wanna be free,  
Don't say you love me, say you like me  
But when I need you beside me,  
Stay close enough to guide me,  
Confide in me, whoa-oh-oh.  
I wanna hold your hand,  
Walk along the sand,  
Laughing in the sun,  
Always having fun.  
Doing all those things  
Without any strings to tie me down.  
I wanna be free,  
Like the warm September wind, babe,  
Say you'll always be my friend, babe,  
We can make it to the end, babe,  
Again, babe, I've gotta say...  
I wanna be free,  
I wanna be free,  
I wanna be free.  

Life is hard for me to touch now.  
I just don't enjoy it as much now.  
When she left, something inside of me died.  
And I won't be the same without her,  
No I won't be the same without her  
By my side.  
  
There's no end end to my sorrow.  
I'm afraid to face tomorrow.  
When she left, she took much more than my pride.  
And I won't be the same without her,  
No I won't be the same without her  
By my side.  
  
It isn't easy to forget her,  
And the way it used to be.  
She changed my life the day I met her.  
And I won't be the same without her,  
No I won't be the same without her  
Close to me.  
  
Life is hard for me to touch now.  
I just don't enjoy it as much now.  
When she left, something inside of me died.  
And I won't be the same without her,  
No I won't be the same without her  
By my side.

If I knew what was bothering you  
I would run to your side  
I don't know why  
I would just die if you left me  
  
Can't you see  
What you're doing to me  
Are you playing a game  
Is it always the same  
Am I to blame?  
Or is anyone?  
  
I don't want to settle down  
With any other girl, but you  
So I'm just gonna wait around  
'Til you decide what you're gonna do  
  
Can't you see  
What you're doing to me?  
Are you playing a game?  
It's always the same?  
Am I to blame?  
Or is anyone?  
  
I don't want to settle down  
With any other girl, but you  
So I'm just gonna wait around  
'Til you decide what you're gonna do  
  
If I knew, what was bothering you,  
I would run to your side, I don't know why,  
I would just die, if you left me.  
  
Can't you see, what you're doing to me?  
Are you playin' a game? It's always the same.  
Am I to blame, or is anyone?  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't want to settle down with any other girl but you,  
So I'm just gonna wait around,  
'Til you decide what you're gonna do. (do)  
  
Can't you see, what you're doing to me?  
Are you playin' a game? It's always the same.  
Am I to blame, or is anyone? (anyone, anyone)  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh.

People come and people go  
Movin' fast and movin' slow  
I'm in a crowd yet I'm all alone  
The road is long the road is rough  
I do believe I've had enough  
I'm gonna turn around and head for home.  
  
And I hope you're there  
And you still care  
And if you do,  
I'll spend my life with you.  
  
I've had all the time I need  
To rearrange my mind and lead  
The life I thought I wanted yesterday  
I played a game that couldn't last  
And now some mem'ries from the past  
Have turned my thoughts around a different way.  
  
And girl, I find  
You're still on my mind.  
And if you want me to  
I'll spend my life with you.  
  
And girl, I find  
You're still on my mind.  
And if you want me to  
I'll spend my life with you.

I thought love was only true in fairy tales  
Meant for someone else but not for me  
Love was out to get me  
That's the way it seemed  
Disappointment haunted all of my dreams  
  
Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer  
Not a trace, of doubt in my mind  
I'm in love, and I'm a believer  
I couldn't leave her if I tried  
No not if I tried  
  
I thought love was more or less a giving thing  
Seems the more I gave the less I got  
What's the use in tryin'  
All you get is pain  
When I needed sunshine I got rain  
  
Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer  
Not a trace, of doubt in my mind  
I'm in love and I'm a believer  
I couldn't leave her if I tried  
Not if I tried  
  
Love was out to get me  
That's the way it seemed  
Disappointment haunted all of my dreams  
What's the use of trying  
All you get is pain  
When I wanted sunshine I got rain  
  
Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer  
Not a trace, of doubt in my mind  
I'm in love and I'm a believer  
I couldn't leave her if I tried  
No not if I tried  
Not if I tried, no  
'Cause I'm a believer  
Yes I'm a believer

Hey!  
Look what you have done.  
Showing me the sun,  
And now it's shining through.  
It's nice to be with you.  
  
Hey!  
I like the things you say,  
And I like the way  
You do the things you do.  
It's nice to be with you.  
  
Each time that I give my heart to someone new,  
They just turn it blue.  
But this time  
Is my time,  
And my time  
Is all the time I have  
To be with you.  
So, please  
Never go away.  
Say you're going to stay,  
And make my dreams come true.  
It's nice to be with you.  
  
Each time that I give my heart to someone new,  
They just turn it blue.  
But this time  
Is my time,  
And my time  
Is all the time I have  
To be with you.  
So, please  
Never go away.  
Say you're going to stay,  
And make my dreams come true.  
It's nice to be with you.

Take the last train to Clarksville  
And I'll meet you at the station  
You can be there by 4:30  
'Cause I've made your reservation  
Don't be slow  
Oh no no no, oh no no no  
  
'Cause I'm leaving in the morning  
And I must see you again  
We'll have one more night together  
'Til the morning brings my train  
And I must go  
Oh no no no, oh no no no  
And I don't know if I'm ever coming home  
  
Take the last train to Clarksville  
I'll be waiting at the station  
We'll have time for coffee flavored kisses  
And a bit of conversation  
Oh no no no, oh no no no  
  
Take the last train to Clarksville  
Now I must hang up the phone  
I can't hear you in this  
Noisy railroad station all alone  
I'm feeling low  
Oh no no no, oh no no no  
And I don't know if I'm ever coming home  
  
Take the last train to Clarksville,  
And I'll meet you at the station,  
You can be here by four-thirty,  
'Cause I've made your reservation, don't be slow,  
Oh, no, no, no,  
Oh, no, no, no,  
And I don't know if I'm ever coming home.  
Take the last train to Clarksville,  
Take the last train to Clarksville,  
Take the last train to Clarksville,  
Take the last train to Clarksville.  

Ev'ry face that I see is all wrapped up in frowns,  
And unfortunately, it kind of gets me down.  
Laugh,  
'Cause the music is funny  
Yeah, the bass sounds off-beat.  
Ain't that neat.  
Laugh,  
When you lose all your money,  
Or you can't find your shoes  
To cover your feet.  
  
It's not so hard to see exactly what I'm after.  
Sometimes a tear should fall, but I require giggles and chuckles  
Laugh,  
When you're keepin' a secret  
And it seems to be known  
By the rest of the world.  
Laugh,  
When you go to a party,  
And you can't tell the boys  
From the girls.  
  
Every face that I see is all wrapped up in frowns  
And unfortunately, it kind of gets me down.  
Laugh,  
At the things that are wrong.  
If you thinks it's this song,  
Then laugh.  
Then laugh.  
Then laugh.  
  
[Repeat to fade]

Hey, hey, mercy woman plays a song and no one listens,  
I need help I'm falling again.  
  
Play the drum a little louder,  
Tell me I can live without her  
If I only listen to the band.  
  
Listen to the band!  
Weren't they good, they made me happy.  
I think I can make it alone.  
  
Oh, mercy woman plays a song and no one listens,  
I need help I'm falling again.  
  
Play the drum a little bit louder,  
Tell them they can live without her  
If they only listen to the band.  
  
Listen to the band!  
Now weren't they good, they made me happy.  
I think I can make it alone.  
  
Oh, woman plays a song and no one listens,  
I need help I'm falling again.  
  
C'mon, play the drums just a little bit louder,  
Tell us we can live without her  
Now that we have listened to the band.  
  
Listen to the band!

Little girl is smart as she can be, woe  
Little girl you've made a fool of me, woe.  
I believed her when she said she really loved me.  
The love was shining in my eyes so couldn't see the lies  
In her eyes.  
  
Little girl knows more than she pretends  
She knew I wanted to be more than friends.  
Every time she hurt me oh how sorry she was,  
Yesterday she went to far and now I'm through because I'm wise  
To all those lies.  
  
Friends said don't worry now she's sweet and she's kind  
Don't be afraid to tell her how you feel all the time  
The little things that bothered me I let them go by  
And now it's too late to cry.  
  
Little girl it's time that we should part  
'Cause little girl now you've broke my heart.  
I couldn't help but hear what they had said about you  
Now I'm ashamed to tell them that I fell in love you.  
They'd laugh at me  
Please set me free.  
  
Friends said don't worry now she's sweet and she's kind  
Don't be afraid to tell her how you feel all the time.  
The little things that bothered me I let them go by  
And now it's too late to cry.  
  
Little girl now I'm through with you  
'Cause you've got everything you wanted too.  
Despite all those things that they said you had done  
You had me believin' now that I was the one  
In your dreams, instead of your schemes.  
  
Little girl, little girl

The other night I took the long way home  
Out past the old schoolyard  
It's funny how you keep it all inside  
Dreams they do die hard  
  
I closed my eyes and I could see your face  
Somewhere back in time  
One summer night a million miles ago  
Back when you were mine  
  
Say yes, say no, say that I'm grabbing at shadows  
But don't carve the words in stone  
I know it's late  
But can't you see I was only  
Taking the long way home  
  
Sometimes its easy to get all wrapped up  
In trying to be free  
And all those dreams I sailed away to find  
Were right in front of me  
  
Say yes, say no, say that I'm grabbing at shadows  
But don't carve the words in stone  
One of these days  
You're gonna see I was only  
Taking the long way home  
  
Although the letters stopped many years ago  
I'll show you even time could not keep this heart  
from letting go  
  
The other night I took the long way home  
Out past the old schoolyard  
It's funny how you keep it all inside  
Dreams they do die hard  
  
Say yes, say no, say that I'm grabbing at shadows  
But don't leave me here all alone  
One of these days  
You're gonna see I was only  
Taking the long way home  
  
Say yes, say no  
But don't leave me here all alone  
One of these days  
You're gonna see I was only  
Taking the long way home

I'm holding my hand out, keeping my head high,  
Trying to get out of mechanical nights,  
When I get to the top of the clear, crystal mountain,  
I'm going to stay up there as long as I can.  
And look down,  
Dig in the sights all around,  
Listen to all of the sounds and look down,  
And look down and look in.  
And my mind sends me reeling, breathing and feeling,  
I remember the time when I tried to come clean,  
But my interests collided, besides I was misguided,  
And who do you confide in when you trip on a dream?  
And look down,  
Dig in the sights all around,  
Listen to all of the sounds and look down,  
And look down and look in.  
If you want to come with me and tell me what you see,  
Just step in beside me and do what you want,  
And you may see clearly, though it sometimes is lonely,  
To be free is the only possession that counts.  
I'm holding my hand out, I'm keeping my head high,  
Trying to get out of mechanical nights,  
When I get to the top of the clear, crystal mountain,  
I'm going to stay up there as long as I can.  
Dig in the sights all around,  
Listen to all of the sounds and look down,  
And look down,  
And look down,  
And look down,  
Look down,  
Look down,  
Look down,  
Hold on, I'm coming.

Look out, here comes tomorrow,  
That's when I'll have to choose.  
How I wish I could borrow,  
Someone else's shoes.  
  
Mary, oh what a sweet girl,  
Lips like strawberry pie.  
Sandra, the long hair and pig tails,  
Can't make up my mind.  
  
I see all kinds of sorrow,  
Wish I only loved one.  
Look out, here comes tomorrow,  
Oh how I wish tomorrow would never come  
  
Told them both that I loved them,  
Said it, and it was true.  
But I can't have both of them  
Don't know what to do.  
  
I see all kinds of sorrow,  
Wish I only loved one.  
Look out, here comes tomorrow,  
Oh how I wish tomorrow would never come  
  
I see all kinds of sorrow,  
Wish I only loved one.  
Look out, here comes tomorrow,  
Oh how I wish tomorrow would never come

Looking for the good times, baby  
Gonna have my fun  
Looking for the good times, baby  
Girl you can come along with me  
Wow, you're gonna see  
Just how fine this big old world can be  
  
Looking for the good times, baby  
Gonna have a ball  
Looking for the good times, baby  
You can share it all  
  
There's more to life than you've been living, girl  
You can share it all  
There's things to do that you ain't thought of yet  
You can share it all  
So let me be the one to do the giving, girl  
You can share it all  
You'll find the things you thought you couldn't get  
  
Looking for the good times, baby  
Gonna have my fun  
Looking for the good times, baby  
Girl you can come along with me - with me  
  
Looking for the good times, baby  
Gonna have a ball  
Looking for the good times, baby,  
Girl you can share it all.

She looked at me  
And the emptiness in her eyes was cruel to see  
Then she turned away and said,  
"Once I loved, but love is dead"  
And I whispered, "Sometimes love is only sleeping"  
  
She said, "I cannot cry  
And I cannot give or feel or even try"  
And her voice was hard and cold  
Then her sweet young face looked old  
And I whispered, "Sometimes love is only sleeping"  
  
Through the endless days and nights  
Could not help but wrap herself in sorrow (sorrow)  
Through the endless days and nights  
She waited for a shiny new tomorrow  
Love was sleeping, sleeping  
  
She looked at me  
And her smiling tears were warm and sweet and free  
And the moonlight kissed her eyes  
As it mingled with our sighs  
And she whispered, "Sometimes love is only sleeping"  
And she whispered, "Sometimes love is only sleeping"  
Only sleeping

Love's a thing that needs one to thrive on  
Then it grows  
At least that's what I've been told  
You can't love someone  
If you find that all you get in return  
A heart that's cold  
  
They say you need love to love  
You gotta have love to love  
They all say it works that way.  
But if it's true,  
Why do I love you?  
Why do I love you?  
  
Seems like you keep trying to break me  
You do things designed just to make me cry  
And I've heard if warm lips don't touch you  
Love won't grow no matter how much you try  
  
They say you need love to love  
You gotta have love to love  
They all say it works that way.  
But if it's true,  
Why do I love you?  
Why do I love you?  
  
They say you need love to love  
You gotta have love to love  
They all say it works that way.  
But if it's true,  
Why do I love you?  
Why do I love you?  
  
Why do I love you...?

By Michael Nesmith  
Love to me is blue-eyed and blonde.  
Oh, that's sweet Magnolia.  
Apple pie on the window still warm.  
That's my sweet Magnolia  
  
Walking under a sky that's so blue  
After rain has fallen.  
When she's walking so close by my side  
My troubles seem to just run and hide.  
  
[la-dee, da-dumb, etc.]  
Well, walking under a sky that's so blue  
After rain has fallen.  
When she's walking so close by my side  
My troubles seem to just run and hide.  
  
Magnolia Simms is my little doll.  
I can't live without her.  
For if she goes my world will just fall.  
Stay with me, Magnolia.  
[Sound of record skipping]  
Stay with me, Magnolia.

Mary, Mary, where you goin' to?  
Mary, Mary, can I go too?  
This one thing I will vow ya  
I'd rather die than to live without ya  
Mary, Mary, where you goin' to?  
  
Mary, Mary, tell me truly  
What did I do to make you leave me?  
Whatever it was I didn't mean to  
You know I never would try and hurt ya  
Mary, Mary, where you goin' to?  
  
What more, Mary, can I do  
To prove my love is truly yours?  
I've done more now than a clear-thinkin' man would do  
  
Mary, Mary, it's not over  
Where you go, I will follow  
Till I win your love again  
And walk beside you  
But until then  
Mary, Mary, where you goin' to?  
  
Mary, Mary, where you goin' to?  
Mary, where you goin' to?  
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, where you goin' to?

I wonder just how long it would be  
Me without you, you without me  
We had a fight last night about something or other  
But it can't be too important if we love one another  
True love always seems to take a little bit longer  
But every time we break up, we make up a little bit stronger  
I wonder just how long it would be  
Me without you, you without me  
Let me tell you know  
I wonder just how long it would be  
Me without you, you without me qo  
Me without you, you without me  
Me without you, you without me  
Me without you, you without me'

Flyin' down the highway, lookin' for a place to land.  
Need to leave the speed in the city  
And people comin', goin', there's no time to understand.  
And I keep movin' down the road taking notes in a trembling hand  
  
Asked Sally to go with me but she made it very clear.  
She said, "You've got your problems and I have mine tonight."  
  
Up to the sunlit mountains, down by the silver sea,  
Well, the tale is told from memory of a finely woven symphony.  
Forever heard without a word to disturb it's melody.  
Still I'd like to have someone along to share the air with me.  
  
Oh, Sally, why not come with me, you know I'd like be with you.  
You can't be all that busy, you don't have that much to do.  
And you know I'd like to be with you.

Deep in the bayou en route to LA  
The merchandise is changing sides  
People are hiding and waiting all day  
'Til midnight comes around  
That's when it's coming down  
And the dreams of a boy  
And his shortcut to easy street will die  
  
Back in the city, she's biting her nails  
Taking it hard - he's doing it for her  
She didn't ask and all he would say  
It's what he had to do  
To make her dreams come true  
But a whisper went 'round on the dark side of town  
And anything that could go wrong  
Is going wrong right now  
  
Midnight when it all comes down  
Only the brave and the fools are around  
Midnight when it all comes down  
Poor little fool, his bravery won't help him now  
  
Touchdown on the water and into the trees  
He's come so far and this is the easy part  
Just gotta follow the flashlight he sees  
And that's where he gets paid  
His fortune will be made  
But a house in the country  
And an acre of green  
Will always be a dream  
They never even knew his name  
  
Midnight when it all comes down  
Only the brave and the fools are around  
Midnight when it all comes down  
Poor little fool, his bravery won't help him now

Now listen just a minute while I sing this song,  
Don't you worry baby it won't take long.  
I'm just about ready to draw the line,  
So don't be surprised if I leave this time.  
  
Well I'm goin' north and I'm goin' south  
Don't want no more of your lyin' mouth.  
I'm hittin' the road, gonna ring some bells,  
Better know I can do it well.  
  
[Chorus]  
Midnight train, ramblin' ramblin'  
All night long I'm gamblin', gamblin'  
Been losin' all my money and it really is funny, umm badda dum.  
Midnight train, ramblin' ramblin'  
Al night I'm gamblin', gamblin'  
Well tell you what baby, well you better be movin' on.  
  
Well I really don't know where I'm goin' for sure,  
Ain't gotta map, it ain't no tour.  
Just headin' out to the open sky,  
Who knows, might even die.  
  
Well don't you worry your pretty little head  
'Cause you never gave a dang what I did or said.  
That's why I'm packin' to leave this place  
Can't stand to look at your cheatin' face.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well you treated me like a little boy  
And played around like I was a toy.  
Guess you thought I'd have the blues,  
Look whose cryin', guess you lose.  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
It's about that time, better be movin' on

Ask your mommy and daddy, "What happened to the Indian?  
How come they're all living in places  
With too much snow or too much sand?"  
Tell your mommy, "I got a funny feeling deep inside of me"  
Ask your daddy, "Is it really as bad as people make it seem?"  
  
Wa ta tick it ta too too  
Ask your mommy why everybody swallows all those little pills  
Ask your daddy why that soldier doesn't care who he kills  
After they've put you to sleep and tucked you safely down in your bed  
Whisper, "Mommy and Daddy would you rather that  
I learned it from my friends, instead?  
Do you think I'm to young to know, to see, to feel, or hear  
My questions need an answer or a vacuum will appear"  
  
Don't be surprised if they turn and walk away  
And tell your mommy and daddy that you love them anyway  
That you love them anyway  
Give them a kiss  
Love will set you free

If your the girl that I know this (the rest of this line is unclear),  
Than your more than welcome to my share of the sidewalk.  
If your the chick I saw in the tall grass looking at someone through tinted
blue glass, than your more than welcome to my share of the sidewalk.  
  
Cause I've never been this close before, to someone who didn't seem to mind.
I've never found hellos before, I've only found goodbyes.  
If your the girl I met in my daydreams, handing out flowers and chocolate ice
cream, than your more than welcome to my share of the sidewalk.  
If your the girl that I talked to and said do you mind if I love you, than
your more than welcome to my share of the sidewalk.  
  
Cause I've never been this close before, to someone who didn't run and hide.
I've never found hellos before, I've only found goodbyes.  
If your the girl I met in my daydreams, handing out flowers and chocolate ice
cream, than your more than welcome to my share of the sidewalk.  
If your the girl that I talked to and said do you mind if I love you, than
your more than welcome to my share of the sidewalk.

From Justus  
Why is it never enough  
No matter what I do?  
I gave it all that I've got  
And it's always too few  
  
And now you're asking for more  
Why do I hesitate?  
Cause I know in the end  
That it's always too late  
And not enough for you  
  
I've often heard you say  
You've got to seize the day  
That when your life is gone,  
Oh how it's gone for so long  
  
But there are often times  
When life is not so kind  
And there are those around  
Who need your feet on the ground  
  
And it's not enough  
It's never enough  
I don't stand a chance  
To fill your sweet lovin' cup  
Cause it's not enough  
It's never enough  
It's not enough for you  
  
Oh, I long for all those years  
Wasted alone with these endless tears  
  
And it's not enough  
It's never enough  
I don't stand a chance  
To fill your sweet lovin' cup  
  
Cause it's not enough  
It's never enough  
  
It's not enough for you  
It's not enough  
It's never enough  
I don't stand a chance  
To fill your sweet lovin' cup  
Cause it's not enough  
It's never enough  
It's not enough for you  
For you

Oh my, my, my-  
In a dusty caravan  
Was a girl with a golden tan  
And she asked me if I was headed to the east  
I politely stepped a side and said I did not need a ride  
That I'd rather take my chances with the heat  
Well, when she turned and walked away  
I saw my big mistake  
There were jewels on her body oh-so-rare  
Had it been another day I just might have rode away  
With that woman riding off to God-knows-where  
So the years they came and went  
And found me living in a tent  
Far above a little marble stream  
And it may have been the light that shone out through the night  
That attracted the hand scratching on my screen  
When I cautiously looked out through the night  
There was no doubt  
That the owner of that hand was that girl  
So I bid her do come in  
And I'll open up a tin  
If you'll tell me 'bout your trip around the world  
Well, she said,"If you think back  
To the first time that we passed  
I'm sure you'll picture me in all my jewels  
It was shortly after then that I ran into another man  
And I asked him the same question I asked you  
But now he he didn't refuse  
And he took off of both his shoes  
And climbed aboard mu east-bound caravan  
In the twinkling of the night  
He knocked me off the side  
And left me there for dead upon the sand  
And I thought I was done  
Lying naked in the sun  
When much to my surprise, who should pass?  
But this old friend of yours  
He said he knew you from the wars  
And I told him that I thought you'd headed west  
Well, he said he should have known  
'Cause you like to be alone  
And that's the time I knew you were my one  
So I asked him for a ride  
Just to get here by your side  
And stay here above this stream  
Out of the sun"  
Well, we sat quite for a while  
And I began to smile  
Well it's strange but I don't care  
And some nights when I'm at rest  
I wonder if I'd said, "yes"  
Would she have come to me from God knows where  
Or would I have been the one to leave her lying in the sun  
And then ended up with only precious stones  
Or would the woman in my arms be giving me her charms  
If the answer that I gave her wasn't "no"

There's a certain something in the way  
You looked at me and said you'd stay  
That let me know that I was out of line  
But I didn't know what else to do  
And like a fool I tested you,  
By demanding things of you which weren't mine  
  
And now I feel like such a fool  
For making you crawl back to me  
But you did it with such love  
That you're standing far above  
Me and all I did to you  
I'm sorry now, what can I do?  
  
I know that never in the world  
That I have found me such a girl  
Who's there to pick me up before I fall  
And if in the end we should go  
Both our separated ways I know  
The lesson I've learned here is worth it all.  
  
Cause now I feel like such a fool  
For making you crawl back to me  
But you did it with such love  
That you're standing far above  
Me and all I did to you  
I'm sorry now, what can I do?  
  
I know that never in the world  
That I have found me such a girl  
Who's there to pick me up before I fall  
And if in the end we should go  
Both our separated ways  
I know the lesson I've learned here is worth it all.

No time, no time for you  
I got no time, baby  
Got lots of better things to do  
  
Runnin' from the risin' heat  
To find a place to hide  
The grass is always greener  
Growin' on the other side  
  
[Chorus x 3]  
No time, no time for you  
I got no time, baby  
Got lots of better things to do  
  
Tryin' to tell the world  
Somehow of how I feel  
Tell me what you said again  
I can't believe it's real  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Andy, you're a dandy  
You don't seem to make no sense  
Nevermind the furthermore  
The plea is self-defense  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Got no time  
I got no time

I walk alone most every night,  
Beneath the stars that shine so bright,  
Bright as the eyes of you.  
And when the sky comes falling down,  
And there is darkness all around, all around,  
I'll be looking for you.  
  
Lonely I look at the dream-flowing meadow  
Won'dring what I am to do.  
Sun going down and the trees cast their shadow,  
In the shadow and the mist, I remember the last kiss of you.  
  
And when the sky wants more blue,  
I get that old longing to, to be held in the arms of you.  
(repeat)  
To be held in the arms of you.

Oh my my, I could love you forever.  
Oh my my, I only wish that I could.  
Oh my my, I could love you forever.  
Oh my my, girl you feel so good.  
  
You, you make my heart sing.  
You make my life worthwhile.  
I feel such there's so much to discover  
To uncover it is gonna take a while.  
  
Oh my my, I could love you forever.  
Oh my my, I only wish that I could.  
Oh my my, I could love you forever.  
Oh my my, girl you feel so good.  
  
I think of us together  
It takes my breath away.  
Up to the sky I go flying  
"Oh my my" is all I can say.  
  
Oh my my  
Oh my my my my  
Oh my my my my my my  
Oh my oh my (oh my oh my oh my my my my my my)  
  
You, you make my heart sing.  
You make my life worthwhile.  
I feel such there's so much to discover  
To uncover it is gonna take a while.  
  
Oh my my, I could love you forever.  
Oh my my, I only wish that I could.  
Oh my my, I could love you forever.  
  
Oh my my, I could love you forever.  
Oh my my, I only wish that I could.  
Oh my my, I could love you forever.  
Oh my girl you feel so good.  

Oh, what a night  
But now I must forget you  
But my heart won't let you  
Out of my life  
Oh, what a day  
We walked around the city  
You said now isn't it a pity  
That I couldn't stay  
But if I could life that night again  
(and again)  
It would be the same  
And if I had the chance  
(just one chance)  
I'd stay another day  
Oh, what a night  
Your kisses were so tender  
I always will remember  
The promises we made  
Oh, what a day  
You smiled and it was magic  
I thought it was tragic  
I had to go away  
But if I could live that night again  
(and again)  
It would be the same  
And if I had the chance  
(just one chance)  
I'd stay another day  
Oh, what a night  
Oh what a night (oh yeah)  
At last we're back together  
I've been wondering whether  
It would feel the same  
Oh what a day (oh no)  
When you said you had another  
I guess I'll recover  
To love again someday  
But if I could live that night again  
(and again)  
It would be the same  
And if I had the chance  
I'd stay another (stay another) day  
I'd stay another day

I'm not liking what I'm typing  
Throw it all away  

No heartaches felt no longer lonely  
Heights of waiting finally won me  
Happiness that's all rolled up in you  
  
And now with you as inspiration  
I look toward a destination  
Sunny bright that once before was blue  
  
I have no more than I did before  
But now I've got all that I need  
For I love you and I know you love me  
  
So take my hand I'll start my journey  
Free from all the helpless worry  
That besets a man when he's alone  
  
For strength is mine when we're together  
And with you I know I'll never  
Have to pass the high road for the low  
  
I have no more than I did before  
But now I've got all that I need  
'Cause I love you and I know you love me  
Yes, I love you and I, know, you, love me

There's a wonderland for Alice  
There's a tall beanstalk for Jack  
The sleepy train will take you there  
So safely down the track  
With the sandman at the throttle  
You'll be off to dreams and back  
It's pillow time again  
  
You will meet all your storybook friends  
As you go down Mother Goose Lane  
Romp with Jack and Jill  
Up and down the hill  
And try to put Humpty together again  
  
Close your sleepy eyes and listen  
While we take a little hop  
The candy whistle's blowin'  
Don't you miss your station stop  
So good night my wee way fairer  
Pleasant dreams to you, oh tot

My, my, the clock in the sky is pounding away  
And there's so much to say,  
A face, a voice, an overdub has no choice,  
An image cannot rejoice.  
  
Wanting to be,  
To hear and to see,  
Crying to the sky.  
But the porpoise is laughing, goodbye, goodbye,  
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.  
  
Clicks, clacks, riding the backs of giraffes for laughs  
S'alright for a while,  
The ego sings of castles and kings and things that go  
With a life of style.  
  
Wanting to feel,  
To know what is real,  
Living is a, is a lie,  
The porpoise is waiting, goodbye, goodbye,  
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye,  
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye,  
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.

Now, well, I tried the one that you put it in and you have to do it  
Manually. But I'd like the one that you just plug it in and it does it all  
By itself in a real long strand and you cut 'em up. It's easier to do it  
That way because, well, I put all the stuff in there and it keeps flippin'  
Out. And I can't get the thing to stick together anything. Coupled with  
The fact that I have to stick two of them together to even get on out of it  
And they always end up lookin' like Lucky Strikes.

Monday had a sad child  
Always feeling low down,  
Tuesday had a dream child  
She's always on the go  
Now I'm in love with Saturday's child  
She drives me wild  
Gonna spend my time  
Makin' sure that Saturday's child is mine.  
  
If you love a Wednesday  
You'll live your life apart now  
And if you love a Thursday  
She's gonna break your heart,  
So I'm in love with Saturday's child  
She drives me wild  
Gonna spend my time  
Makin' sure that Saturday's child is mine.  
  
Seven days of the week made to choose from  
But only one is right for me  
I know that Saturday's got what it takes, babe.  
I can tell by the way she looks at me  
  
Friday likes the good life  
She'll take you for a ride now  
And Sunday makes a good wife  
But she wants to be a bride  
So I'm in love with Saturday's child  
She drives me wild  
Gonna spend my time  
Makin' sure that Saturday's child is mine.

When the world and I were young,  
Just yesterday.  
Life was such a simple game,  
A child could play.  
It was easy then to tell right from wrong.  
Easy then to tell weak from strong.  
When a man should stand and fight,  
Or just go along.  
  
But today there is no day or night  
Today there is no dark or light.  
Today there is no black or white,  
Only shades of gray.  
  
I remember when the answers seemed so clear  
We had never lived with doubt or tasted fear.  
It was easy then to tell truth from lies  
Selling out from compromise  
Who to love and who to hate,  
The foolish from the wise.  
  
But today there is no day or night  
Today there is no dark or light.  
Today there is no black or white,  
Only shades of gray.  
  
It was easy then to know what was fair  
When to keep and when to share.  
How much to protect your heart  
And how much to care.  
  
But today there is no day or night  
Today there is no dark or light.  
Today there is no black or white,  
Only shades of gray.  
Only shades of gray.

When your dreams have died around you, she'll be there  
When you need a hand to guide you, she'll be there  
And when you feel rejected 'cause life is not what you expected  
I know that she'll be there  
If I hadn't lied and cheated, she'd be here  
If she wasn't so mistreated, she'd be here  
And if you don't abuse her, I know you'll never, ever lose her  
And she will always be there  
I was too late to discover  
How much I really did love her  
But now, her place is with you  
And I must face it, it's over with you  
She'll be there, she'll be there  
And if you don't abuse her, I know you'll never, ever lose her  
And she will always be there, she'll be there  
She'll be there, she'll be there

I'm feeling very bad today  
Another cat came into stay  
He's eating all my food  
He's speaking very rude  
He's gonna change the mood  
  
I'm feeling very bad today  
A red balloon got in my way  
It followed me around  
But never touched the ground  
What can I say?  
  
He built a house upon a hill  
Ask him if he's happy and then give him a pill  
He's going mad  
He bought another car today  
Ask him if he's happy, then turn the other way  
He's going mad (repeat over and over)  
  
I'm feeling very bad today  
Another cat came into stay  
He's eating all my food  
He's speaking very rude  
He's gonna change the mood  
  
Black and shiny now you've finally  
Gotten everything you've wanted  
And you're taunted by the power  
That you really don't want anymore  
  
Everybody's talking faster  
Hurry up get me a master  
I don't have much time to lose  
And besides I'm polishing my shoes  
  
Crossing the street  
Watching your feet  
Or you'll die in a thunderbird light  
Wishing with all of your might  
That you read the newspaper that  
You forgot to buy today  
How will you know what they do when they say  
Say(repeat over and over)  
  
I'm feeling very bad today  
Another girl came by to stay  
I can't think of a word  
To tell you what I've heard  
I've been away [Repeat x10]  
  
I am my?

Some people always complain that their life is too short so they hurry it
along  
Their worries drive them insane but they still go along for the ride  
As for me  
I have all the time in the world  
  
I was born  
A someday man  
I'm a maybe child  
I was born  
A someday man  
I was always wild  
  
Tomorrow's a new day, baby  
Anything can happen  
Anything can happen at all  
  
Some folks are working for reasons and waiting for answers they're never  
gonna find  
They keep on searching for pleasures and looking for what they can't see  
But for me  
Life can be a sweet holiday  
  
I was born  
A someday man  
I'm a maybe child  
I was born  
A someday man  
I was always wild  
  
Tomorrow's a new day, baby  
Anything can happen  
Anything can happen at all  
  
I was born  
A someday man  
I'm a maybe child  
I was born  
A someday man  
I was always wild  
  
I was born  
A someday man  
I'm a maybe child  
I was born  
A someday man  
I was always wild

Know that something very strange  
Is happening to my brain.  
I'm either feeling very good  
Or else I am insane.  
The seeds of doubt you planted  
Have started to grow wild  
But feel that I must yield before  
The wisdom of a child  
  
And it's love you bring,  
No that I can't deny,  
With your wings,  
I can learn to fly,  
Sweet young thing.  
  
People try to talk to me  
Their words are ugly sounds  
But I resist all their attempts  
To try and bring me down  
Turned on to the sunset,  
Like I've never done before.  
And I listen for your footsteps  
And your know upon the door.  
  
And it's love you bring,  
With dreams of bluer skies  
All these things,  
When I seem them in your eyes  
Sweet young thing.

Though you've played at love and lost  
And sorrow's turned your heart to frost  
I will melt your heart again.  
Remember the feeling as a child  
When you woke up and morning smiled  
It's time you felt like you did then.  
There's just no percentage in remembering the past  
It's time you learned to live again at last.  
  
Come with me, leave yesterday behind  
And take a giant step outside your mind.  
  
You stare at me in disbelief  
You say for you there's no relieve  
But I swear I'll prove you wrong.  
Don't stay in your lonely room  
Just staring back in silent gloom.  
That's not where you belong  
Come with me I'll take you where the taste of life is green  
And everyday holds wonders to be seen.  
  
Come with me, leave yesterday behind  
And take a giant step outside your mind.

Reasoned verse some prose or rhyme  
Lose themselves in other times  
And waiting hopes cast silent spells  
That speak in clouded clues  
It cannot be a part of me  
For now it's part of you  
Sunshine, rag time, blowing in the breeze  
  
Midnight looks right standing more at ease  
Silhouettes and figures stay  
Close to what he had to say  
And one more time the faded dream  
Is saddened by the news  
It cannot be a part of me  
For not it's a part of you

About as low as I felt in a long time  
And I know that I did a wrong at the wrong time  
It's plain to see, she's down on me  
And I know she'll feel that way for a long time  
  
I was high on top but I didn't know it  
Tell me, why did I have to go and blow it?  
I used my lines too many times  
And now I've got a badly hurt heart to show it  
  
Took me too long to discover  
How much I really love her  
How'd I ever end up in this bind?  
What a drag  
  
There she goes looking for pretty clover  
No one knows what it's like until it over  
Without a doubt, I just found out  
And I suppose I never did get to know her  
  
Tear drop city, Tear drop city  
Took me to long to discover  
How much I really love her  
How'd I ever end up in this bind  
What a drag  
  
About as low as I felt in a long time...

Kickin' stones on an old dirt road  
Feelin' d-dejected and all alone  
When I looked up ahead thought my mind I'd blown  
On a giant toadstool sat a teeny tiny gnome  
  
He was all involved in a game of solitaire  
Said "hello" with a smile just like I wasn't there  
I kicked dirt some more  
He said "please don't start a fight."  
Found a church key in his pocket, he opened up his pipe  
  
He blew some silver circles,  
Wound his fingers in his beard  
And from that pipe came magic music  
Like I'd never heard  
  
As the notes came floatin' in I pricked up both my ears  
I walked up to the drive-in, hadn't felt so starved in years  
A rabbit waiter took my order and quickly disappeared  
He said "the party's over,  
Please come back in a thousand years."

Oh tell me, love, and tell me truly  
Do you believe this is forever?  
Well I tell you, love, that I believe you  
Oh, when you tell me that you will leave me never  
  
Oh tell me, love, that all my words are a waste  
Oh tell me, love, are my lips to your taste?  
'Cause I want to please you, I want to please you  
And tell me, love, do you know you amaze me?  
You keep changing for the better with every passing day  
Well, I'll tell you, love, sometimes it kinda scares me  
I've got to keep on getting to you, so you don't get away  
  
Oh tell me, love, that all my words are a waste  
And tell me, love, are my lips to your taste?  
'Cause I want to please you, I want to please you  
And tell me, love, please tell me, love, tell me, love

You always say you like my style.  
You say I'm tough and kind of wild.  
Am I too much for you to tame?  
I swear this time it's not a game.  
I've known a lot of girls.  
No, this I won't deny.  
I'll give our love,  
I'll give it more than a try.  
That was then, (that was then) this is now.  
Let me prove my love girl, I'll make you proud.  
I never made (never made) this kind of vow.  
That was then, this is now  
I've led a thousand lives it seems.  
And there's been a lot of broken dreams.  
My mind's just swept love aside.  
But you broke me down and put me wise.  
I've doubted all compassion,  
But you showed me the door.  
I can't doubt it,  
I don't doubt it no more.  
That was then, (that was then) this is now.  
Let me prove my love girl, I'll make you proud.  
I never made (never made) this kind of vow.  
That was then, this is now.  
I've known a lot of girls.  
No, this I won't deny.  
I'll give our love,  
I'll give it more than a try.  
That was then, (that was then) this is now.  
Let me prove my love girl, I'll make you proud.  
I never made (never made) this kind of vow.  
That was then, this is now.  
That was then, this is now.  
That was then, this is now.  
  

There'll be birds singin' everywhere,  
And the wind will be blowin' through your hair.  
I'll look in your eyes  
And wait for the prize  
Your lips kissing mine  
With a love that is real.  
And you'll look so young and fair  
  
On the day we fall in love!  
You and me  
On the day we fall in love.  
You'll see!  
  
There'll be rainbows reachin' cross the sky  
And we'll both be so happy we will cry.  
We'll walk hand in hand  
In snow or in sand  
Whether roses are blooming  
Or snowmen stand by.  
Time will stop, for you and I  
  
On the day we fall in love!  
It will be on the day we fall in love.  
You'll see!  
  
And if the lines that I say fall apart,  
It's because I won't know where to start.  
But you'll understand when I say them to you,  
'Cause they'll come straight from my heart.  
  
On the day we fall in love,  
You and me,  
On the day we fall in love,  
You'll see,  
You'll see.

With his fool's gold stacked up all around him  
From a killing in the market on the war  
The children left King Midas there, as they found him  
In his counting house where nothing counts but more  
  
[Chorus]  
And he thought he heard the echo of a penny whistle band  
And the laughter from a distant caravan  
And the brightly painted line of circus wagons in the sand  
Fading through the door into summer  
  
Well, it's travel onto "maybe next year" 's places  
As a trade-in for a name upon the door  
And he pays for every year he cannot buy back with his tears  
As he finds out there's been no one keeping score  
  
[Chorus]

You tell me that youve never been this way before.  
You tell me things I know that Ive heard somewhere.  
Youre standing in the places and youre  
Staring down through faces, that bring to mind traces  
Of a girl, a girl that I knew somewhere.  
  
I just cant put my finger on what it is  
That says to me watch out! dont believe her.  
I cant give any reasons girl,  
My thoughts are bound down in a whirl.  
I just cant think who in the world was that girl,  
I know I met her somewhere.  
  
Someway, somehow this same thing was done.  
Someone, somewhere did me this same wrong.  
  
Well, goodbye dear, I just cant take this chance again.  
My fingers are still burning from the last time.  
And if your love was not a game, I only have myself to blame.  
Thats as may be, I cant explain.  
  
Just ask the girl that I knew somewhere.

Its old enough to try and tie you down  
So, I just couldn't wait and hang around  
You always said must be free  
But you couldn't see you were loosing me  
And messing up the one good thing we had  
  
[Chorus]  
And now I'm going out the way that I came in  
The game is over now, I couldn't win  
My heart is all I have to pack  
And this time girl I won't be back  
And years from now I'll turn around and see  
The girl I left behind me  
  
I told myself that things would be OK  
You would come around to my way any day  
As time went on you just stayed the same  
No, you couldn't change or be rearranged  
I'm picking up the pieces of my life  
  
[Chorus]  
  
As time went on you just stayed the same  
No, you couldn't change or be rearranged  
I'm picking up the pieces of my life  
  
[Chorus]  
Behind me

Girl, you look mighty good to me  
And I know that you've got to be  
The kind of girl I could love.  
  
You've got the sweetest pair of eyes  
And your kiss would be paradise  
You're the kind of girl I could love.  
  
You do something to my soul  
That no one's ever done.  
If you're looking for true love  
Then let me be the one.  
  
Girl, deep in my soul I'm sure  
And my heart has no doubt that you're  
The kind of girl I could love.  
The kind of girl I could love.

By David Jones and Steve Pitts  
"The circus is coming to town." it said on the poster.  
"Get your tickets now, before it's too late."  
A dancing bear and a circus clown it's so funny.  
I can't wait to see everything there.  
  
I feel like I'm already there.  
I must see her fly through the air.  
  
Horse running 'round and 'round in a circle.  
I can't wait to see everything there.  
I wonder if it's just like they say on the poster.  
If it is I know I will be there.  
  
I feel like I'm already there.  
I must see her fly through the air.  
I feel like I'm already there.  
I must see her fly through the air.

Here we come, walkin'  
Down the street.  
We get the funniest looks from  
Everyone we meet.  
  
Hey, hey, we're the Monkees  
And people say we monkey around.  
But we're too busy singing  
To put anybody down.

We don't have time to get restless,  
There's always something new.  
  
Hey, hey, we're the Monkees

We may be comin' to your town.

You call my name then you run for protection  
I reach out to hold ya' but it's just a reflection  
Throught the looking glass  
  
Now you've been looking at your life through a mirror  
It's time you started seeing things a little bit clearer than  
Through the looking glass  
  
Watch me break through, girl  
I still love you, girl  
  
I think you love me by the way you come on girl  
Then I turn away for a minute, you're gone girl  
Through the looking glass  
  
Ahh...  
You're looking through me  
Like you never knew me  
  
I've got some things that I'm tryin' to show ya  
But you fade away how can I get to know 'ya  
Through the looking glass

From Justus  
It breaks my heart to say "Goodbye"  
I know that I deserve to cry  
I know that time will see me through  
But in this mean time  
All I dream about is you  
  
Unlucky stars are in my sky  
My fortune teller, she saw me and cried  
She said that I might have to wait  
My lucky ship is lost  
And comin' in too late  
  
Unlucky stars  
Unlucky stars  
Venus and Mars  
Are up in arms  
  
If now it's time to let to  
Give me some time to let you know  
That I adored you till the end  
I couldn't stand another day without a friend  
I couldn't stand another day without a friend

Valleri. I love my Valleri.  
There's a girl I know who makes me feel so good.  
And I wouldn't live without her, even if I could.  
They call her Valleri.  
I love my Valleri.  
  
She's the same little girl who used to hang around my door.  
But she sure looks different than the way she looked before.  
I call her Valleri.  
I love my Valleri.  
  
Valleri. I love my Valleri.  
I love my Valleri.  
I need ya, Valleri.

Did you buy your tickets for the war game?  
Aren't you glad that your sitting in the back?  
For the game is deadly having all the players  
Aren't you glad it's a spectator sport  
  
Can't you hear the cries?  
It isn't over  
Can't you smell the fear?  
It's all over  
  
If you want to play the game, you must have playmates  
Choose your side play guitar (???) but play to win  
Don't be sad if you loose it it isn't over  
Pick your side and begin the game agian  
It isn't over  
  
Can't you hear the cries?  
It isn't over  
Can't you smell the fear?  
It's all over  
  
You don't have to play the game if you don't want to  
You can sit at home and hear it on the news  
They will show you colored pictures of the killings  
They want you to feel that you're part of it too.  
  
Can't you hear the cries?  
It isn't over  
Don't you smell the fear?  
It's all over  
It's all over

Just a loud mouth Yankee I went down to Mexico.  
I didn't have much time to spend, about a week or so.  
There I lightly took advantage of a girl who loved me so.  
But I found myself a-thinkin' when the time had come to go  
  
[Chorus]  
What am I doin' hangin' round?  
I should be on that train and gone.  
I should be ridin' on that train to San Antone,  
What am I doin' hangin' round?  
  
She took me to the garden just for a little walk.  
I didn't know much Spanish and there was no time for talk.  
Then she told me that she loved me not with words but with a kiss.  
And like a fool I kept on thinkin' of a train I could not miss  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well it's been a year or so, and I want to go back again.  
And if I get the money, well I'll ride the same old train.  
But I guess your chances come but once and boy I sure missed mine.  
And still I can't stop thinkin' when I hear some whistle cryin'  
  
[Chorus]

They told me what you'd do  
If I ever stayed with you.  
They told me that you'd laugh  
While I cried.  
  
They told me what you'd say  
That you'd turn and walk away  
And find another place to play,  
While I cried.  
  
Now I think back on those times  
I didn't read between the lines.  
How all the things that you said  
Never seemed to match the things you did.  
  
Thoughts keep turning round in my mind  
Now I see reason and rhyme.  
Time spent with you has brought me something  
And I've lost nothing If you are that kind.  
  
They told me what you'd do  
If I ever stayed with you  
And sure enough,  
It all came true.

Girl, don't you know every time I see you smiling,  
It hurts so bad, cause when I see you, I start crying,  
I've tried everything to stop, but there's no denying,  
That falling in love with you, girl, is just like dying.  
  
Oh, don't walk away,  
How, how can I make you stay?  
Don't turn away,  
I can still hear you saying those words that never were true,  
Just spoken to help nobody but you,  
Words with lies inside,  
But, small enough to hide till your playing was through.  
  
Girl, don't you know we could work it out with talking?  
You won't look around or slow down your walking,  
I've given you everything with kiss to seal it,  
You had to get your kicks out of trying to steal it.  
  
Now, I'm standing here,  
Strange, strange voices in my ears,  
I feel the tears,  
But, all I can hear are those words that never were true,  
Just spoken to help nobody but you,  
Words with lies inside,  
But, small enough to hide till your playing was through, ahh.  
  
Now, I'm standing here,  
Strange, strange voices in my ears,  
I feel the tears,  
But, all I can hear are those words that never were true,  
Just spoken to help nobody but you,  
Words with lies inside,  
But, small enough to hide till your playing was through.  
Words that never were true,  
Just spoken to help nobody but you,  
Words with lies inside,  
But, small enough to hide till your playing was through.  
Words that never were true,  
Just spoken to help nobody but you,  
Words with lies inside,  
But, small enough to hide till your playing was through.  

Did you know the waters turning yellow?  
Have you heard the sky was falling down?  
Did you see that guy fall out the window?  
Did you know the circus was in town?  
  
Have you heard about Bill Chambers mother?  
She said a woman's work is never done.  
And oh yes, about that yellow water,  
Have you noticed the color of the sun?  
  
You have a way of making everything you say seem unreal  
Are you aware that the people who care are mostly stainless steel?  
  
Well I heard you finally got my letter.  
It should have come about this time last year.  
And I hope Bill Chamber's mother's better.  
Oh did the moon just disappear?  
  
You have a way of making everything you say seem unreal  
Are you aware that the people who care are mostly stainless steel?

You and I have seen what time does, haven't we?  
We both had time to grow  
You know we've got more growing to do, me and you  
And the rest of them too  
  
You can see the changes we've been going through  
Such a pity, what a shame  
Who can we blame?  
You and me, me and you, and the rest of them too  
  
In a year or maybe two  
We'll be gone and some one new will take our place  
There'll be another song,  
Another voice, another pretty face  
  
You and I have seen what time does haven't we?  
We've both had time to grow  
You know we've got more growin' to do  
Me and you, and the rest of them too

All men must have someone, have someone  
Who would never take advantage  
Of a love bright as the sun.  
Someone to understand them,  
And you just may be the one.  
  
All men must have someone, have someone  
Who would never take for granted  
All the pleasures and the fun.  
Someone to stand beside them  
And you just may be the one.  
  
I saw when you walked by  
The love light in your eye  
And I knew I must try  
To win you more than just a friend,  
I'm starting near the end,  
And I go again.  
  
All men must have someone, have someone  
Who would never take advantage  
Of a love bright as the sun.  
Someone to stand beside them  
And you just may be the one.  
Someone to understand them,  
And you just may be the one.

You told me you'd always stay, you told me!  
You told me you'd never stray, you told me!  
All these things you said you said sincerely.  
Still I am leaving you in spite of what you told me.  
  
I've heard things that did not match what you told me.  
And of your love that would not last as you told me.  
Forwarned is forearmed, it hurts, I'm leaving.  
I may be wrong I can't love what I'm just hearing.  
  
Times have made me shy  
Of all the things you're saying  
Time have made me shy  
Of girls and all the games they are playing.  
  
Someday I may see the truth of what you told me.  
I may find I left too soon and that you told me.  
Only things that you were honestly feeling.  
I must have more to love than what you told me.  
  
Yes, I must have more to love than what you told me.  
Yes, I must have more to love than what you told me.

She knows her mind all right, your Auntie Grizelda,  
She says she knows my kind, she might, maybe so.  
Oh, yeah, she's raised you right, your Auntie Grizelda,  
You only know the things she wants you to know.  
  
I know she's having a fit,  
She doesn't like me a bit,  
No bird of grace ever lit on Auntie Grizelda.  
  
You can't begrudge her style, your Auntie Grizelda,  
She couldn't budge a smile and do it for free.  
So righteous making fudge, your Auntie Grizelda,  
So proper judging others over her tea.  
  
You look just like her you do,  
I know by looking at you,  
That you've been listening to your Auntie Grizelda.  
  
Oh, no, don't look at me like Auntie Grizelda  
It takes much more to be someone of your own.  
You've got to make it free from Auntie Grizelda  
Or just like her you'll have to make it alone.  
  
I know she's having a fit,  
She doesn't like me a bit,  
No bird of grace ever lit on Auntie Grizelda.  
  
Auntie Grizelda, Auntie Grizelda

You're so good to me, tell me what can I do for you

By Bill Chadwick and John Chadwick  
The king of Zor, he called for war  
And the king of Zam, he answered.  
They fashioned their weapons one upon one  
Ton upon ton, they called for war at the rise of the sun.  
  
Out went the call to one and to all  
That echoed and rolled like the thunder.  
Trumpets and drums, roar upon roar  
More upon more.  
Rolling the call of "Come now to war."  
  
Throughout the night they fashioned their might  
With right on the side of the mighty.  
They puzzled their minds plan upon plan  
Man upon man  
And at dying of dawn the great war began.  
  
They met on the battlefield banner in hand.  
They looked out across the vacant land.  
And they counted the missing, one upon one,  
None upon none.  
The war it was over before it begun.  
  
Two little kings playing a game.  
They gave a war and nobody came.  
And nobody came.  
And nobody came.  
And nobody came.  
And nobody came.
