Woken up on mornings such as this  
Thought exactly the same as I'm thinking now  
Every night for a year I've slept alone  
Cold, damp room looks worse than me, no, no, no  
  
Got a fear of death that creeps on every night  
I know I won't die soon, but then again I might  
Water down the drain, I'm wasting away  
Doctors can't help the ghost of a man that's me, no, no, no  
  
Water down the drain goes to the sea  
The pattern of my life keeps a-haunting me  
Moisture from the ocean fills the sky  
Come on down to the ground as the time goes by  
  
Slow down there  
  
I never found out the reason why  
My parents had to lie  
About the place that I was born  
Or from my hometown I was torn  
At the tender age of four  
I was livin' by homemade law  
  
I never knew when it was to be laid,  
My desires are never displayed,  
I never knew what it was to be loved,  
I never knew what it was to be laid,  
I never knew what it was to win,  
I never knew what it was to be loved,  
No, no, no  
  
Get on up there  
  
I never knew what it was to be laid  
No, no, no, no, no, no, no

Mother, don't you recognize your son?  
Coming home 'cause I failed you, mother  
I'll be there in the morning  
If you'll have me back  
The rent up here is much too high  
For a room without a tap  
I'll be early in the morning  
And I'll find my way back home  
Back home, bad 'n' ruin  
With my tail between my legs  
Tail between my legs  
And I'll be so tired  
  
I'll be early tomorrow morning  
And I'll fall down off my plane  
Don't be embarrassed, mother  
By your ugly worn-out son  
Your ugly worn-out son  
  
Mother, you won't recognize me now  
Mother, you won't recognize me now  
Mother, you won't recognize me now  
  
And I'll be down on Cannon street  
Passport in my hand  
Should you not recognize me  
I've heavily made-up my eyes  
Mama, you won't recognize me now  
Brother, you won't recognize me now  
Sister, you won't recognize me now  
Mother, you won't recognize me now  
  
So, mother, when you've seen me  
Don't forget I'm your boy too  
I know my brother has done you proud  
He's one foot in the grave  
Mother, don't you recognize me now?  
  
I'm a burglar in the first degree  
But it don't seem to worry me  
I'll be so tired, so tired  
I'll be so tired, so tired  
  
So tired

Oh Cindy ain't you noticed  
That several of your friends have moved on  
And the street outside is just a little too quiet  
And your local papers run out of news  
I'm not persuading you or disengaging you  
But Cindy you and me we got to move  
  
Can you refuse, no time to lose  
We'll hit the high road early this morning  
So don't be late, don't hesitate  
This dream can pass just as fast as lighting  
And oh Cindy incidentally baby I ain't putting you on  
  
Can you refuse, with nothing to lose  
We'll hit the high road early this morning  
So don't be late, don't hesitate  
This dream can pass just as fast as lighting  
  
Oh Cindy don't you worry  
'Cause between us we can make it through  
There ain't nothing no no nothing  
In the world I can do without you  
So Cindy get your coat on  
Leave the rent with the gent up in the penthouse  
Turn your music so loud let's attract a big crowd  
We'll drink a round to this town and bid goodbye

Now a country boy named shorty  
And a city boy named dan  
Had to prove who could run the fastest  
To wed miss lucy's hand  
  
Now dan had all the money  
And he also had the looks  
But shorty musta had that something boys  
That can't be found in books  
  
Cut across shorty, shorty, cut across  
That's what miss lucy said  
Cut across shorty, shorty, cut across  
You know it's you that I want to wed  
  
Wait a minute  
Now dan had been in training  
About a week before the race  
He made up his mind old shorty  
  
Would end in second place  
You know dan with his long legs flying  
He left shorty far behind  
Shorty heard him holler out  
  
Miss lucy that you'll soon be mine  
Cut across shorty ... but shorty wasn't worried  
There was a smile upon his face  
'Cause old lucy had fixed the race  
  
And just like that old story  
About the turtle and the hare  
You know that thing  
When danny crossed over the finish line  
  
He found shorty waiting there  
Cut across shorty ...  
It's you that I want to wed, no no  
And oh lord it's you I want to wed  
It's you that I want to wed

I left you on the debris  
At the Sunday morning market  
You were sorting through the odds and ends  
You was looking for a bargain  
I heard your footsteps at the front door  
And that old familiar love song  
'Cause you knew you'd find me waiting there  
At the top of the stairs  
I went there and back  
Just to see how far it was  
And you, you tried to tell me  
But I had to learn for myself  
There's more trouble at the depot  
With the general workers union  
And you said, "They'll never change a thing  
Well, they won't fight and they're not working"  
Oh, you was my hero  
How you are my good friend  
I've been there and back  
And I know how far it is  
But I left you on the debris  
Now we both know you got no money  
And I wonder what you would have done  
Without me hanging around

So good to be with  
The people that know you.  
It's good to hear  
The things that they say,  
At times when you are with them.  
So good to note  
My strength is growing from day to day,  
There's not a thing  
I try to do without you  
  
Troubled times of pain that come  
I take them any old day.  
You come and you wash them all away  
  
Everywhere you sing in everything,  
And I try by remembering  
All the things that you said to me,  
From within all you did for me.  
Just one word.

Last night, I was woken by my cry  
Had a dream just as plain as you and I  
Saw the morning sun on a woodland in the spring  
Still hear the echo crashing through the trees  
Oh, when I saw you down, I fell upon my knees  
  
You and I we were wearing Southern grey  
I called to you, but I used another name  
I beat the ground, and I cried out in your pain  
Through a scarlet door I watched you slipping away  
And your brother's helpless prayers were all in vain  
  
Last night, I was woken by my cry

I'm flying  
Across the ocean  
And I'm soaring  
Back home  
To the place I was born  
And probably raised.  
And I'm flying  
Across the mountains and valleys,  
Back home to the one that I love so happily.  
  
Can ya blame me for feeling homesick  
'Cause I've been away such a very long long time  
I served a while in the county jail  
Five years for being hungry tired and poor  
  
On and on  
Yes I will follow  
With your buttons and bows.

Thought I was lookin' good  
So I cycled 'cross the neighborhood  
Was invited by a skinny girl  
Into her high class world  
  
Left my bicycle under the stairs  
Laid my coat across the kosher chairs  
Made my way across the crowded room  
I had nothing to lose  
  
My reception wasn't very keen  
So turning on a friendly grin,  
Stood on the table with my glass of gin  
And came straight to the point  
  
I was glad to come  
I'll be sad to go  
So while I'm here  
I'll have me a real good time  
  
I was glad to come  
I'll be sad to go  
So while I'm here  
I'll have me a real good time. Oh no  
  
Dancin' madly 'round the room, yeah  
Singing loudly and sorta' out of tune  
Was escorted by a friendly slag  
'Round the ... back  
  
Wandered c-c-cross ...  
Missed my step and I fell on the floor.  
Said one word and was asked to leave  
Kinda' wish I was dead.  
  
I was glad to come  
And I'll be so sad to leave,  
But while I was here  
I had me a real good time, oooh.  
  
The skinny girl made it clear,  
That she only came here for the beer - that's a fact, oh yeah  
The vicar he simply reeked of gin - good God  
  
On my way home I happened to fall off my bicycle, good party  
Ooh hoo, ha ha, yeah  
  
I was glad to come, but I was also glad to get home, yeah  
Ooh hoo  
Hoo, get in there  
Ooh hoo

I got a letter  
It come to me by mail  
My baby's coming' home  
I hope that she don't fail  
  
[Chorus]  
Because I feel so good  
I feel so good  
You know I feel so good  
Feel like ballin' the jack  
  
I drove into town to that old station  
Just to meet her old train  
My baby said she's a-comin' home  
I hope that she won't fail  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Feel so good, I hope I always will  
Feel just like I just got out of jail  
Way off behind the hills  
  
[Chorus]

Your love is fading I can feel your love fading  
Woman it's fading away from me  
'Cause your personal touch has grown cold  
As if someone else controls your very soul  
I fooled myself long as I can  
I can feel the presence of another man  
  
It's there when you speak my name  
It's just not the same  
Oh honey I'm losing you  
I can feel it in the air, it's there everywhere  
Oh I'm losing you  
  
I can feel it in my bones  
Any day you'll be up and gone  
Oh I'm losing you  
It's all over your face someone's takin' my place  
Could it be that I'm losing you  
  
When I look into your eyes a reflection of a face I see  
Oh Lord I'm losing you  
I'm hurt, downhearted and worried girl  
'Cause that face doesn't belong to me  
  
Your love is fadin' I can feel it fadin'  
Oh away from me  
I can feel it in the air, it's there everywhere  
Oh I'm losing you  
I don't wanna lose you  
But I know I'm gonna groove you  
Oh Lord I'm losing you  
  
I don't wanna lose you  
But I know I'm gonna groove you  
Oh Lord I'm losing you, and I'm a losin' you  
  
Your love is fadin' I can feel it fadin'  
Oh Lord I'm losing you

Sunshine blue skies please go away  
The girl has found another and gone away.  
With her went my future my life is filled with gloom  
So day after day I stay locked up in my room.  
I know to you, it might sound strange but I wish it would rain,  
  
'Cause so badly I wanna go outside  
But everyone knows that a man ain't supposed to cry  
Listen, I gotta cry 'cause crying eases the pain,  
Oh yeah, people this hurt I feel inside.  
Words could never explain, I just wish it would rain.  
  
Day in day out my tear-stained face  
Pressed against the window pain,  
My eyes search the skies desperately for rain,  
Cause rain-drops will hide my tear -drops  
And no one will ever know that I'm crying,  
Crying when I go outside.  
To the world outside my tears,  
I refuse to explain, oh I wish it would rain,  
Let it rain, let it rain.  
I need rain to disguise the tears in my eyes.  
Oh, let it rain.  
I'm a man and I got my pride  
Til' it rains I'm gonna stay inside and let it rain.

(foster, jordan)  
  
Something told me it was over  
When I saw you and him talking  
Something deep down in my soul said, cry boy  
When I saw you and him out walking  
I would rather, I would rather go blind girl  
Than to see you walk away from me child  
  
So you see I love you so much  
I don't want to see you leave me baby  
Most of all I just don't, I just don't want to be free  
I was just, I was just sitting here thinking  
Of your kiss and your warm embrace child  
When the reflection in the glass  
That I been held to my lips now baby  
Revealed the tears I had on my face  
I would rather, I would rather be blind child  
Than to see you walk away from me  
Baby, baby, baby I would rather go blind  
Than to see you walk away from me

If I'm late, darling, don't hesitate  
Just go without me, and I'll see you there anyway  
If I miss you at the station  
I want you on that train  
I don't want a sad sack  
'Cause I'll be there come what may  
  
Leave a message with the porter  
Or leave it at the gate  
Just let me know that you're aboard her  
Just a word to know that you're safe  
  
I walk from Maryland to Silver town  
I hoped to catch you in the street  
I must have missed you by a moment, dear  
I tried the place we always meet  
  
So if I'm late darling, don't hesitate, no, no  
Go on your lonesome, and I'll catch you there anyway  
I might lose sometime, babe  
But if I do, I'll make amends in an hour  
When I'm laying down beside you

Baby used to stay out all night long  
She made me cry  
You know she done me wrong  
She held my eyes open and that's no lie  
  
Tables turned and now it's her turn to cry  
Because I used to love her but it's all over now  
Yes it is  
Because I used to love her but it's all over now  
  
Listen  
She used to run around with every single man in town  
Spent all my money playing her fast game  
She put me out, it was a pity how I cried  
  
But the tables turned and now it's her turn to cry  
Because I used to love her but it's all over now  
Ain't no lie  
Because I used to love her but it's all over now  
  
Well I used to wake the morning get my breakfast in bed  
When I got worried she'd ease my aching head  
But now she's here and there with every single man in town  
But the tables turned and now it's her turn to cry  
Because I used to love her but it's all over now  
Yes it is  
Because I used to love her but it's all over now  
  
But then I used to love her but it's all  
But then I used to love her but you know  
But you know it's all over now  
But then I used to love her but you know it's all over now

(john lennon)  
  
I was dreaming of the past  
And my heart was beating fast  
I began to lose control  
I began to lose control  
I didn't want to hurt you  
And I'm sorry I made you cry, no  
I didn't want to hurt you, no I didn't care  
I'm just a jealous guy  
I was feeling insecure  
You might not need me anymore  
I was shivering inside  
I was shivering inside  
I didn't want to hurt you  
And I'm sorry I made you cry, oww  
I didn't want to hurt you, no I didn't care  
I'm just a jealous guy

(ronnie lane)  
I close my eyes and ignore all the signs  
I'm walking 'round in circles  
I've closed my ears and believed my own lies  
And break the silence always  
I make a lot of words, big storm in the air  
All 'round your hair it's blowing  
Just leave it be and it will all blow away  
The weather's always changing  
You can go if you want to  
I don't own you, go be wild  
  
Leave my hand, it's wide open  
So's the door evermore  
It hurts me more to think i'll keep you in chains  
Than if you were to leave me.  
I am what you are and I'm running too,  
All for the open prairie.  
So you can go if you want to  
I don't own you, go be wild  
Leave my hand it's wide open  
So's the door forevermore.

It's hard to believe that this is the place  
Where we were so happy all our lives  
Now so empty inside and feeling no pain  
Waiting for a hammer, and a big ball and chain  
  
They can tear it all down and build something new  
But only I remember what was here  
Tomorrow comes easy, just another day gone  
How long will I have to keep returning?  
  
Now I look back think I've known all the time  
I've been finding myself for so long  
All the vows that we made  
Count for old bags of lumber  
Disappear on the cart down the road

Maybe I'm amazed at the way you love me all the time  
Maybe I'm afraid of the way I'll leave you  
Baby I'm amazed at the way you fool me all the time  
You hung me on a line  
Oh baby I'm amazed at the way I really need you  
  
Baby, I'm a man, oh baby  
I'm a lonely man who's in the middle of something  
That he doesn't really understand  
Baby, I'm a man, oh baby  
You're the only woman that could ever help me  
Baby, won't you try to understand  
  
Baby, I'm a man, oh baby  
I'm a lonely man who's in the middle of something  
That he does not really understand, good God, hoo  
Baby, I'm a man, oh baby  
You're the only one that could ever help me  
Baby, won't you try to understand  
  
Baby, I'm amazed at the way you're with me all the time  
Baby, I'm afraid of the way I'll leave ya'  
Baby, I'm amazed at the way you help me sing the song  
You right me when I'm wrong  
Baby I'm amazed at the way I really need ya'  
  
Baby, I'm a man, oh baby  
I'm a lonely man who's in the middle of something  
That he does not really understand  
Baby, I'm a man, oh baby  
You're the only woman that could ever help me  
  
Baby, won't you try to understand  
There you go,  
Baby I'm amazed, the way I really need you  
Alright, just about warming up and getting into it right about here

Miss Judy she was moody  
Owned a sweaty farm in old Alabam  
I was just 18, crude and mean  
All I needed was to get my own way  
Get out of my way  
  
Miss Judy she could have me  
Any hour of the working day  
She'd send me in the corn field mid afternoon  
Said son it's all part of your job  
  
Miss Judy had a cross eyed poodle  
That I would kick if I was given the chance  
Never was amused by the kindness I used  
I was whipped in the barn until dawn  
It hurt me  
  
Last summer we was restless  
Were gonna make a stand and burn down your farm  
But it was all in the head  
'Cause out in the yard  
Miss Judy had the National Guard  
We was beaten, before we started  
  
Miss Judy she was moody  
And she always didn't get her own way  
  
Just state the facts, get it right  
Kick her when she's down

I'm waiting here in patience  
Am I waiting all in vain?  
Will I see you? will I touch you?  
Will I hear you call my name?  
Come and make  
Ten steps to every one step that I take  
  
Nobody comes and nobody goes,  
No one is happy, and no one has woes.  
Everything lasting, ever the same,  
Nothing is ending, nothing can change.  
  
The good lord always has been,  
Always will be ever the same.  
And confusion mixed with illusion  
All years only turn again  
With one and one hundred names  
Had all the rooms, our key is to change.  
  
Nobody comes and nobody goes,  
No one is happy and no one has woes,  
Everything lasting, nothing can change,  
Nothing is ending, ever the same

I don't care who is watching  
Don't mind what the surfing heads might say  
And though I may not be no Charlie Atlas  
Gonna take my shirt off anyway  
Now skin and bones sits easy on the high tide  
And I'm not one for castles in the sand  
I've seen a girl I once knew from the East Side  
I think I spy a bottle in her hand  
I think I spy a bottle in her hand  
I don't need to know your birthday  
'cause what you tell her I don't claim to be  
There's a place I know of called the Tick Tock  
Won't you come and take a walk with me  
Won't you come and take a walk with me  
Didn't take too much hard work to get her  
Melted like a chocolate in my arms  
If you had ever seen it better  
It never did the scenery no harm  
Never did the scenery no harm  

Poor old granddad  
I laughed at all his words  
I thought he was a bitter man  
He spoke of woman's ways  
  
They'll trap you, then they use you  
Before you even know  
For love is blind and you're far too kind  
Don't ever let it show  
  
[Chorus]  
I wish that I knew what I know now  
When I was younger.  
I wish that I knew what I know now  
When I was stronger.  
  
The can can's such a pretty show  
They'll steal your heart away  
But backstage, back on earth again  
The dressing rooms are gray  
  
They come on strong and it ain't too long  
Before they make you feel a man  
But love is blind and you soon will find  
You're just a boy again  
  
When you want her lips, you get a cheek  
Makes you wonder where you are  
If you want some more and she's fast asleep  
Then she's twinkling with the stars.  
  
Poor young grandson, there's nothing I can say  
You'll have to learn, just like me  
And that's the hardest way  
Ooh la la  
  
[Chorus]

Sweatin' hard, I didn't get a shot  
All I did was stand around and get too hot  
Knowin' all the people walkin' on my side  
Losin' all my money and I'm getting tired  
Ol' Bill he come a'runnin' like he's gettin' some  
Makes you kind of jealous but it sure is fun  
I don't mind, but he wants my lady too  
  
You know the crowd gets bigger as the word goes 'round  
Pool hall king was playin' back in town  
Minnesota Fats standin' up at the back  
Tryin' to hide himself in a plastic mack  
You ought to hear the silence when the kid walks in  
His reputation's bigger than gasoline  
I don't mind but he's tryin' to fill my lady too  
Pool Hall Richard, you're far too wicked we know  
Pool Hall Richard, kid you're wicked, we know  
You broke my heart  
Same as you could ever do  
With your yellow carnation and your pink satin shoe  
You make me jealous but I worship you  
One day soon I'm gonna beat you clean  
Wipe that smile right off your chin  
Everybody gonna drive from miles around  
Cuein' up to see me take away your crown  
Then you'll never never ever take my lady then  
  
Pool Hall Richard, you're far too wicked we know  
Pool Hall Richard, kid you're wicked, we know  
You broke my heart  
Same as you could ever do  
Dig this  
Bam goes the brown, that's another one down  
Know they play much better when the sun goes down  
Bang goes the green, you're so obscene  
Your hands are dirty but your scent is clean  
Bam goes the blue, lock away your cue  
The pool hall king is hustlin' you  
Bam goes the 8-ball, didn't see it spin at all  
This kid can play, oh yeah  
  
Bam goes the brown, ooh another one down  
Know they play much better when the sun goes down  
Bang goes the green, you're so obscene  
Your hands are dirty, your scent is clean  
Damn the pink, one more to sink  
Gonna beat you someday 'cause you're makin' me sick  
Down on the black, at the back of the pack  
Aw, you nearly missed, you ain't so hot  
  
Pool Hall Richard, kid you're wicked, we know  
You broke my heart  
Same as you could ever do  
You're breakin' my heart  
But you're stealin' my tart  
Shut up

I wish I , I wish I was in Richmond  
I do, I would I  
I wish I, I wish I was back home  
I'm waitin' here in New York City  
The rain is falling  
There's no one who cares  
There's no one loves me here  
The women, they may look very pretty  
And some they know it  
But some look good  
They show a leg and smile  
But they all look like the flowers  
In someone else's garden  
I'll not act on love  
For anyone but you  

I shake and I shudder and I shiver  
In my bath while it's cold and my windows are broken,  
As my poor dog lays a-chokin' on the floor.  
  
I cried to my father and my mother,  
There's no justice divine,  
I wonder when I get mine.  
'Cause I'm so sick and tired of waitin' for the Lord.  
  
I find just what it is I'm looking for  
There's a man wants to show me the river.  
Hoofing at five I'll be more dead than alive.  
I find a reason to survive when I'm too old.  
  
Should I walk in the lightning and the thunder  
On a hilltop so high and show my face to the sky ?  
Will I find just what it is I'm looking for ?

Wait a minute honey  
I don't think the joke's too funny  
No I stayed up all night  
Checking out the doctor's guide  
  
Wait a minute honey  
Stop pretending you're a bunny  
Well I might've guessed  
You been to see a specialist  
  
I remember you said  
That we gotta keep a breast of time  
But obviously you don't know  
Where to draw the line, well  
  
Don't try to tell me it's a-what you been eating  
Since when have you been forty-four around  
Get on with the song, yeah  
  
Dig this, at the Moulin Rouge tell you baby  
We could knock'em dead  
Just sign right here, all I need is ten percent  
  
Well, now you make me feel like a pimp in the White House  
For a senator's daughter you're stealing all the headline news  
All the headline news  
  
Oh shake me, shake me, shake me up all night long  
We all need a laugh and I guess you're just the one  
Well you got more front than Haig Museum  
Oh home grown silicone  
You really got the best of me  
  
You really got the best of me

In the morning  
Don't say you love me  
'Cause I'll only kick you out of the door  
  
I know your name is Rita  
'Cause your perfume smelling sweeter  
Since when I saw you down on the floor  
guitar  
  
Won't need to much persuading  
I don't mean to sound degrading  
But with a face like that  
You got nothing to laugh about  
  
Red lips hair and fingernails  
I hear your a mean old Jezebel  
Lets go up stairs and read my tarot cards  
  
Stay with me  
Stay with me  
For tonight you better stay with me  
  
Stay with me  
Stay with me  
For tonight you better stay with me  
  
So in the morning  
Please don't say you love me  
'Cause you know I'll only kick you out the door  
  
Yea I'll pay your cab fare home  
You can even use my best cologne  
Just don't be here in the morning when I wake up  
  
Stay with me  
Stay with me  
'Cause tonight you better stay with me  
Sit down, get up, get down  
  
Stay with me  
Stay with me  
Cause tonight your going stay with me  
Hey, whats your name again  
Oh no, get down

(ronnie lane)  
Once I was a stone many years ago  
Into a pool was thrown many years ago.  
Time passed by, the pool ran dry, excavated was i.  
And tempered and beat in a fiery heat,  
By the hand of a man, who's name was dan  
Dan the blacksmith.  
Once I was a sword, many years ago.  
And my blade was broad, many years ago.  
Worn with pride, into battle I'd ride at a warrior's side.  
And I cut and I killed and was lost in a field,  
And I soon did rust, corrode to dust,  
Oh my.  
Once I was a daisy, many years ago.  
In pastures green and lazy, many years ago.  
But I was et by a goat who fell in a moat and forgetting to float  
He sunk like a lead and stayed until dead,  
But was relieved to find just how kind it all was.  
Once I was a grub, many years ago.  
I lived in muck and mud, many years ago.  
But on the very first noon I became a cocoon that resembled a prune.  
When the good lord was done in the warmth of the sun.  
I shed my skins, and dried my wings, and I flew away.  
Once I was a bullfrog, had to struggle for survival.  
And once I was a carp and lived in waters ornamental.  
And once I was a myna bird, quoting verses from the bible,  
Said "pretty boy, pretty boy, st. luke".  
Once I was a mule, a many years ago.  
But my master treat me cruel, a many years ago.  
By and by I was sick, couldn't move to his kick, so he took out a stick  
And hit it right 'cross my back to an almighty crack,  
And to his dismay, I passed away, into the blue.  
I was born a human baby, many years ago.  
I was born unto a lady, many years ago.  
All our hopes they were piled on the back of a child that turned out to be
wild.  
Sent the devil a prayer and caused the parson to swear.  
So I took my leave to lie and thieve my way to jail.  
I've been tinker, tailor, soldier, sailor.  
I've known good times and disaster.  
But now I've found a teacher, and the teacher has a master,  
The master is perfection, so he'll help us get there faster.  
I don't need no proof, because that's the truth, and I'll drink to that.  

Sweet Lady Mary has to rest her poor head  
Wakes in the morning with her breakfast in bed  
I tried to help her, but I did not know how  
I tried to love her, but it's all over now  
Nothing left to comfort me, except a sunny day  
Steal away, steal away  
  
Over the stones along the dusty old road  
With every footstep one more tale is told  
With every turning one more side to see  
Sweet Lady Mary's seen the last of me  
A lesson is learnt, I'll never come this way again  
I'll steal away, steal away  
  
Her Spanish habits are so hard to forget  
The lady lied with every breath, I accept  
Was a matter of time before my face did not fit  
I knew all along I'd have to quit.  
Anyway now, I better not waste anymore of your time  
I'll steal away, steal away  
  
I think I'll go back home and start all again  
Where the Gulf Stream waters tend to ease the pain  
And on a new day when I've mended the wound  
Sweet Lady Mary's gate I swear I'll be bound  
But before I sit down again and waste anymore of your time  
I better steal away, steal away  
  
Ooh-hoo  
Steal away-ay.  

May the smile on your face  
Come straight from your heart  
Takes a lady like you  
To write that for me  
To wake up with you  
Makes my morning so bright  
Wipes the sleep from my eyes  
When you tell me your dreams  
And it goes on and on  
Way beyond and out of reach  
It's a well known old secret  
Go and tell everyone  
Tell everyone  
The smile on your face  
Comes straight from your heart  
If you look you will find  
And you wrote that for me  

I don't need no one's opinion  
On the matter concerning my dress  
I was raised in a clinic down in Oklahoma  
There were many things I did not possess  
I never complained because my father said  
"son, you'll get your chance before you're my age."  
Then he took me upstairs and gave me this suit  
Written all over his face  
  
He said, "others may come and others may go  
But that suit will be around wherever you're goin'."  
Three button hand me down  
Three button hand me down  
  
I had my fair share of neat women  
But they came between me and my suit  
That was a filly from Boston, a barmaid from Houston  
Not forgetting the one in Detroit  
They said, "we like you, boy, and we think you're sweet  
But can't you lose your suit?"  
I said, "no, you can't do that to me."  
I remember what my father said  
  
He said, "others may come and others may go  
But that suit will be around wherever you're goin'."  
Three button hand me down, ha, ha  
Three button hand me down  
  
I've never been a tidy dresser  
And the fold in my trousers - it ain't straight  
Still, I know a good cloth when I see one  
That's why I'm clad in this gray flannel suit  
Sometimes I wonder if I should visit a tailor  
And get myself a smooth outfit  
Then I remember what my father said to me  
I'll make you from the open road  
  
He said, "others may come and others may go  
But that suit will be around wherever you go."  
Three button hand me down  
Three button hand me down

Too bad we was thrown downstairs  
You never got a chance to sing  
We were quite polite  
With one invite  
To keep us off the street  
We mingled for a minute or two  
With the high class clientele  
And then somebody said who invited them  
That crowd of refugees  
  
What an insult to be shown the door  
Before we could shake a leg  
I was most intrigued by the colored queen  
Leaning on the kitchen door  
Then I was ushered with my friends  
By the butler who was twelve feet tall  
Well let me please explain  
That were not to blame  
We just don't have the right accent  
No, no  
  
All we wanted to do was to socialize  
Oh you know its a shame  
I was always getting the pain  
  
All we wanted to do was to socialize  
Oh you know its a shame  
How we always get the blame  
  
Twenty girls, damp hotels  
Is where I'm gonna stay  
Cause now I see what it's all about  
I didn't at the old school side  
Don't worry we had more fun  
Waiting for the all night bus  
Too bad my regional tongue  
Gave us away again

There was a wicked messenger  
From Eli he did come  
With a mind that multiplied  
The smallest matter  
When questioned who had sent for him  
He answered with a thumb  
For his tongue it could not speak  
But only flatter  
He stayed behind the assembly hall  
It was there that he made his bed  
Often times he could be seen returning  
Until one day he just appeared  
With a note in his hand which read  

Hey baby, I want to say somethin' to ya', listen  
  
Sometimes when I get out of my head  
And I say all the wrong things  
Sometimes I know I stay out late at night  
And I get back fighting, hey babe  
Somehow all my plans  
Keep slippin' through my hands  
And I end up crying, but listen  
I can be a millionaire  
Honey when you're standing there  
You're so exciting  
  
You can make me dance, you can make me sing,  
You can make me do just any old thing, and I love it  
  
Sometimes I want to get up so early  
And get away from here girl  
Summer's gone, and before long  
North winds blow, that bring the snow  
I'll keep us warm girl  
My schemes it seems, are merely dreams  
Fading with each morning, hey babe  
But this old heart of mine  
Is far too proud not to keep on tryin'  
  
You can make me dance, you can make me sing,  
You can make me do just any old thing, yeah baby  
  
Ah yeah  
  
So little bird don't fly away  
Want you here every day  
Don't ever leave me  
I'd rather lose both my eyes  
Than never see your smiling face again girl  
  
You can make me dance, you can make me sing,  
You can make me do just any old thing  
You can make me dance, you can make me sing,  
You can make me do just any old thing  
  
Hey babe  
Keep on loving me babe, yeah  
Keep on loving me babe  
Just keep on loving me babe  
Just keep on loving me babe  
Just keep on loving, ooh babe  
  
Just keep on loving me darling  
Just keep on loving me darling  
Just keep on loving me darling, darling, darling, darling  
Ha ha  
  
Wow, alright  
Hey baby  
Oh darling  
Keep on loving me darling  
Just keep on loving me darling  
Just keep on loving me darling  
Just keep on loving me darling

My mom she likes you, she thinks your swell  
Got the makings of a dance hall girl  
Your low cut frock and your birds nest hair  
Stepping up heels and the way that you smell  
She says to take you back  
To see my folks again on Sunday  
  
Why it looks as though there's nobody in  
They've all went out to see my Auntie Renny  
Don't you worry you just come right in  
I'm sure we'll pass the time 'til they come home  
Well let me take your coat  
Take off your shoes, warm your toes, try the sofa  
  
It's getting dark we'll miss the late night bus  
It's only eight but I'm not taking any chances  
What's that noise why'd they come back so soon  
Straighten your dress you're really looking a mess  
I'll wet my socks pretend we just got caught in the rain  
Oh you're so rude
