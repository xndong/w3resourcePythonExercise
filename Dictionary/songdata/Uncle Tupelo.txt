Falling out the window  
Tripping on a wrinkle in the rugfalling out of love, dear  
It hurt much worse when you gave up  
  
Just don't tell me which way I oughta run  
Or what good I could do anyone  
'Cause my heart it was a gun  
But it's unloaded now  
So don't bother  
  
Climbing up the ladder  
Breaking my shin on the very first rung  
Waking up the neighbors  
It's all right,they understand they're just as dumb  
  
And they don't tell me which way I oughta run  
Or what good I could do anyone  
'Cause my heart it was a gun  
But it's unloaded now  
So don't bother me now  
Don't bother  
  
Crawling back to you now  
I sold my guitar to the girl next door  
She asked me if I knew how  
I told her I don't think so anymore  
  
Don't tell me which way I oughta run  
What good could I do anyone  
'Cause my heart it was a gun  
But it's unloaded now  
So don't bother

Try to face up to the blinding sun  
Racing for the final word to come  
Facing up, it's hard to stay devout  
I can see the sand and it's running out  
And it's running out  
  
We quote each other only when we're wrong  
We tear out the threads and move along  
We can't seem to find common ground  
I can see the sand and it's running out  
  
It was only circumstances  
But it's the difference  
It gets in the way  
No race is run in this direction  
  
You can't break even  
You can't even quit the game  
The current drags to the bottom  
A hemorrhage that moves us around  
  
It pulls and beckons in a strong direction  
High water forever bringing us down  
I can see the sand and it's running out  
It's running out  
  
It was only circumstances  
But it's the difference  
It gets in the way  
No race is run in this direction  
You can't break even  
  
You can't even quit the game

Well I took a fifth, and I poured me a shot  
And I thought about all the things that I haven't got  
And I drank that down, and I poured me some more  
Kept drinking and pouring till I felt the floor  
  
I got drunk and I fell down  
I got drunk and I fell down  
  
Another slow day in this damn town  
Keep asking yourself "why am I still hangin' around?"  
You spend half your time just staring into a beer  
What you need, you know, you can't find here  
  
I got drunk and I fell down  
I got drunk and I fell down  
  
Well I took a fifth, and I poured me a shot  
And I thought about all the things that I haven't got  
And I drank that down, and I poured me some more  
Kept drinking and pouring till I felt the floor  
  
I got drunk and I fell down  
I got drunk and I fell down  
  
I got drunk and I fell down  
I got drunk and I fell down

John Hardy, he was a desperate little man  
Carried two guns every day  
Shot a man down by the West Virginia line  
They saw John Hardy get away  
They saw John Hardy get away  
  
They cornered John Hardy on the Tombstone bridge  
He thought that he was free  
'Til the deputy sheriff came and grabbed him by the arm  
Said "Johnny, come along with me"  
"Johnny, come along with me"  
  
John Hardy, he stood inside his cell  
Tears running down his eyes  
Said "I've seen the death of many a poor boy  
Now I'm ready to die  
Now I'm ready to die"  
  
Well, I've been to the east and I've been to the west  
I've been the whole world round  
I've been to the north and I've been to the south  
Now I'm going to my hanging ground  
I'm going to my hanging ground

This song is sung for anyone that's listening  
This song is for the broken-spirited man  
This song is for anyone left standing  
After the strain of a slow, sad end  
  
It seems everybody wants what someone else has  
There's sorrow enough for all  
Just go in any bar and ask  
With a beer in each hand and a smile in between  
All around's a world grown mean  
  
We've all had our ups and downs  
It's been mostly down around here  
Now this whole damn mess is becoming quite clear  
  
Looks like we're all looking for a life worth livin'  
That's why we drink ourselves to sleep  
Yeah, we're all looking for a life worth livin'  
That's why we pray for our souls to keep  
  
There's nothing left now but broken pieces  
Of one man's broken will to care  
And in the end before all is said and done  
How many others might follow him there?  
  
This song is sung for anyone that's listening  
This song is for the broken-spirited man  
This song is for anyone left standing  
After the strain of a slow, sad end  
  
Midnight is comin' 'round  
Still mostly down around here  
Now this whole damn mess is becoming quite clear

I've been a moonshiner  
For seventeen long years  
And I spent all my money  
On whisky and beer  
And I go to some hollow  
And set up my still  
If whisky don't kill me  
Lord, I don't know what will  
  
And I go to some barroom  
To drink with my friends  
Where the women they can't follow  
To see what I spend  
God bless them pretty women  
I wish they was mine  
With breath as sweet as  
The dew on the vine  
  
Let me eat when I'm hungry  
Let me drink when I'm dry  
Two dollars when I'm hard up  
Religion when I die  
The whole world is a bottle  
And life is but a dram  
When the bottle gets empty  
Lord, it sure ain't worth a damn

All my daydreams are disasters  
She's the one I think I love  
Rivers burn and then run backwards  
For her, that's enough  
  
They all come from New York City  
And they woke me up at dawn  
She walked with me to the fountain  
And she held onto my arm  
  
Come on, do what you did  
Roll me under New Madrid  
Shake my baby and please bring her back  
'Cause death won't even be still  
  
Caroms over the landfill  
Buries us all in its broken back  
There's a man of conviction  
And although he's getting old  
  
Mr. Browning has a prediction  
And we've all been told  
So come on back from New York City  
Roll your trucks in at dawn  
  
Walk with me to the fountain  
And hold onto my arm  
Come on, do what you did  
Roll me under New Madrid  
  
Shake my baby and please bring her back  
'Cause death won't even be still  
Caroms over the landfill  
Buries us all in its broken back

Fear the hearts of men are failing  
These our latter days we know  
The great depression now is spreading  
God's word declared it would be so  
  
I'm going where there's no depression  
To a better land that's free from care  
I'll leave this world of toil and trouble  
My home's in heaven  
I'm going there  
  
In this dark hour, midnight nearing  
The tribulation time will come  
The storms will hurl the midnight fear  
And sweep lost millions to their doom  
  
I'm going where there's no depression  
To a better land that's free from care  
I'll leave this world of toil and trouble  
My home's in heaven  
I'm going there  
  
I'm going where there's no depression  
To a better land that's free from care  
I'll leave this world of toil and trouble  
My home's in heaven  
I'm going there

I don't know what you've been through  
You might think that I don't care  
But I do  
And I've tried to understand  
  
I've tried to understand your abuse  
But you've got no excuse  
And there's no use in lovin'  
Anyone who hates themselves  
  
You keep coming back  
So I hold you for a little while  
But I always go when I can't take your sad smile  
'Cause I can't stand it when you get so intense  
  
And it's all a part of our bad inheritance  
And there's no sense in lovin'  
Anyone  
Won't you come back for a while  
  
You could see exactly what you've always meant to me  
But you don't want to know  
You don't want to know  
And you don't know what I've been through  
  
And if I think that you don't care  
You probably do  
And there's no sense in lovin'  
Anyone who hates themselves

Satan, your kingdom must come down  
Satan, your kingdom must come down  
I heard the voice of Jesus say  
Satan, your kingdom must come down  
  
Gonna pray until they tear your kingdom downgonna pray until they tear your
kingdom downI heard the voice of Jesus say  
Satan, your kingdom must come down  
  
Gonna shout until they tear your kingdom downgonna shout until they tear your
kingdom downI heard the voice of Jesus say  
Satan, your kingdom must come down

It's a long way to heaven  
It's a short way to hell  
Painkillers won't help  
When the weight's not yourself  
  
They're poisoning the air  
For personal wealth  
It's a long way to heaven  
It's a short way to hell  
  
I don't know what I'm breathing for  
'Cause the air around here ain't so good anymore  
The weatherman says "fair"  
But he looks like a lie  
  
Nothing's free in this country  
And there's no place to hide, no more  
Industrial wind  
It blows from the west  
  
It'll burn out your eyes  
And suck out your breath  
It's waiting in the wings  
For damage down the line  
  
Save your tears for the soaps  
Leave your money behind  
I don't know what I'm breathing for  
'Cause the air around here ain't so good anymore  
  
The weatherman says "fair"  
But he looks like a lie  
Nothing's free in this country  
And there's no place to hide no more  
  
No place to hide, no more

This old town is filled with sin,  
It'll swallow you in  
If you've got some money to burn.  
(So) Take it home right away,  
You've got three years to pay  
But Satan is waiting his turn.  
  
This old earthquake's gonna leave me in the poor house.  
It seems like this whole town's insane.  
On the thirty-first floor a gold plated door  
Won't keep out the Lord's burning rain.  
  
The scientists say  
It'll all wash away  
But we don't believe any more  
Cause we've got our recruits  
And our green mohair suits  
So please show you ID At the door.  
  
This old earthquake's gonna leave me in the poor house.  
It seems like this whole town's insane.  
On the thirty-first floor a gold plated door  
Won't keep out the Lord's burning rain.  
  
A friend came around.  
Tried to clean up this town.  
His ideas made some people mad.  
Cause he trusted his crowd,  
So he spoke right out loud,  
And they lost the best friend they had.  
  
This old earthquake's gonna leave me in the poor house.  
It seems like this whole town's insane.  
On the thirty-first floor a gold plated door  
Won't keep out the Lord's burning rain.  
  
On the thirty-first floor a gold plated door  
Won't keep out the Lord's burning rain.  
  
On the thirty-first floor a gold plated door  
Won't keep out the Lord's burning rain.

A worn out joke to keep the flies away  
Carried it this far  
Got the west side winds to keep it steady  
We bury the hatchets we find  
  
Could carry that heavy load  
If I really thought it would matter  
Farcical hair appears  
As a blind side, clean the slate  
  
Working in the halls of shame  
Lay it down in full view  
Lay it down  
What the hell were we thinking  
  
Before the fire burned out?  
I can't find you now  
And I didn't know you then  
Loneliness drinks the bitters  
  
Till the cold winds warm again  
It's a feel for the game  
Mouth open wide, screams and hollers  
Working in the halls of shame  
  
Lay it down in full view  
Lay it down  
I gambled once and won, never made a dollar  
And beauty fades to grey  
  
And I pray the very best will guard her  
And provide the way  
It's a telltale sign  
When it's chairs up, and time to go  
  
Working in the halls of shame  
Lay it down in full view  
Lay it down

Never again, your so called friend  
Will leave you sick and dry  
This friend has a name  
Knows the gutter and shame  
This so called friend of you and I  
  
?, the long-term goals  
Are to leave this friend behind  
He knows what I lack  
Is a place under the sack  
For every other tie that binds  
  
This last night on the town  
Might be your last fun time out  
And you think to yourself  
There must be a better way than the same routine  
For more than once, you pay  
More than once, you pay  
  
Butt full of lead, stuck in your web  
Held captive by the stream  
Thoughts in your head  
The minute I sped  
And you still had time to dream  
  
This last night on the town  
Might be your last  
And you smile at things and wave goodbye  
More excuses to never even try  
As you wave goodbye  
  
Forget what I said, your friend's not dead  
He's only gone for a while  
Come back to that crack between what's white and what's black  
And give you one last smile  
  
This last night on the town  
Might be your last fun time out  
And you think to yourself  
There must be a better way than the same routine  
For more than once, you pay  
More than once, you pay

I don't see you through the windshield  
I don't see you in faces looking back at mealcohol doesn't have much that
matters to saycan't imagine where you and time to kill will stay  
  
When the bible is a bottle  
And the hardwood floor is home  
When morning comes twice a day or not at allif I break in two will you put me
back together  
When this puzzle's figured out will you still be around  
To say you've just been there  
Walking the line upside down  
  
Walked and breathed many a cancerous mile  
Where the bat of an eye is too slow to beat the coffin  
They won't tell it on the TV  
They can't say it on the radio  
They pay to move it off the shelf and into our mindsuntil you can't tell the
truth  
When it's right in front of your eyes  
  
When the bible is a bottle  
And the hardwood floor is home  
When morning comes twice a day or not at all  
If I break in two will you put me back together  
When this puzzle's figured out will you still be around  
To say you've just been there  
Walking the line upside down

The thousand times I lived before were just in my dreams  
Well, I woke up to realize it didn't mean a thing  
I've seen several better places, several better times  
Somehow those memories got left behind  
  
Give me back that year, good or bad  
Give me back something that I never knew I had  
  
I guess it all boils down to it was just a second guess  
So god damn long ago it's hard to feel I did my best  
And I think of our relationship and all  
And why I can't see that anymore in your eyes  
  
Give me back that year, good or bad  
Give me back something that I never knew I had  
  
Well, I sit and watch it go by  
I sit and watch shit go by  
Go by  
  
That year

I've been searching and you've been gone  
Out looking for the shortest path to the one that you're on  
And I've already seen all I want to see  
Come on, let's take the long cut  
I think that's what we need  
When we were younger, we were strong  
We felt a lot better than the things that we'd done  
Now if it's to be, if you still believe  
Come on let's take the long cut  
I think that's what we need  
If you want to take the long cut  
  
We'll get there eventually  
I've been searching and you've been gone  
Out looking for the shortest path to the one you're on  
Now if it's to be, if you still believe  
Come on let's take the long cut  
I think that's what we need  
We've been in a deep rut  
And it's been killing me  
If you want to take the long cut  
We'll get there eventually

I can only sing it loud  
Always try to sing it clear  
What the hell are we all doing here  
Making too much of nothing  
Or creating one unholy mess  
An unfair study in survival, I guess  
  
But it always comes down to  
What to do when it's all around you  
And this tightwire act  
Leaving us here for dead to news of the world  
And liquor piles up ahead  
Dodging those with words of power  
Forever on their breath  
When the quality of life gets tripped upstrangled like death  
It seems it's getting harder out thereespecially without time enough to see  
  
True to life is another hangover  
True to life is more and more politics  
True to life is always having to look over your shouldertrue to life is
assembly-line sickness  
  
But it always comes down to  
What to do when it's all around you  
  
And this tightwire actleaving us here for dead to news of the world  
And liquor piles up ahead  
Dodging those with words of power  
Forever on their breath  
When the quality of life gets tripped upand strangled like death  
It seems it's getting harder out thereespecially without time enough to see

Some folks find that their role in life is to fail at everything they try
while other folks see but not like me  
There's one thing that they're damn good at  
  
Gather around you all  
Come around and see  
Those who stand tall  
Why don't you please watch me fall  
  
The hole it is wide and it's there to divide it's no one's fault,  
It's put there by design and there's a bridge yet to build as many men have
willed that can stand the weight of all those who wish to pass  
  
Gather around you all  
Come around and see  
Those who stand tall  
Why don't you please watch me fall

There's a guitar leaning on a Marshall stack  
Used to sound like the sun on the horizon  
Now I think we've been had  
There's a young girl screaming all the way in the back  
  
Poor kid, she never saw it coming  
Now she knows she's been had  
Watching the label spinning on my turntable  
There's no call waiting in my headphones  
  
And every star that shines in the back of my mind  
Is just waiting for its cover to be blown  
There's an eardrum bleeding, yeah it's in my head  
How could I still be so in love when I know  
  
We've been had?  
Republicans and Democrats can't give you the facts  
Your parents won't tell you 'til you're grown  
That every star that shines in the back of your mind  
  
Is just waiting for its cover to be blown  
Flashing the badges, just like the law of averages  
Nobody likes 'em where they're from  
And every star that hides on the back of the bus  
  
Is just waiting for its cover to be blown

Persuaded, paraded, inebriated, and down  
Still aware of everything life carries on without  
'Cause there's one too many faces with dollar sign smiles  
Got to find the shortest path to the bar for a while  
  
A long way from happiness  
In a three hour away town  
Whiskey bottle over Jesus  
Not forever, just for now  
Not forever, just for now  
  
There's a trouble around, it's never far away  
The same trouble's been around for a life and a day  
I can't forget the sound, 'cause it's here to stay  
The sound of people chasing money and money getting away  
  
A long way from happiness  
In a three hour away town  
Whiskey bottle over Jesus  
Not forever, just for now  
Not forever, just for now  
  
In between the dirt and disgust there must be

Hunted down  
Someone said, no story, no gain  
Wipe the clock right now  
I despise what you crave  
  
I remember you  
When you wore a different face  
Never heard a story of anyone  
Who drove the blacktop insane  
  
Leaning on a stoplight  
Waiting for eventual change  
What's it matter right now  
It's not so easy to gauge  
  
Every time  
That you ask for more  
It's the sound that makes the colors go blind  
  
And everything comes in threes  
But your face shows two  
Lost in the watershed  
Way out of tune  
  
Ain't it hard  
When the spirit doesn't catch you  
Gravity's the winner  
And it weighs you down  
It weighs you down
