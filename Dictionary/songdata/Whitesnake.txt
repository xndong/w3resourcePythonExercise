Tonight's the night  
To come in out of the cold,  
I've waited such a long, long time  
I'm getting out of control  
All or nothing  
That's what I want from you,  
I'm gonna give you everything I got  
Now what are you gonna do  
  
Don't try running away,  
You know you get nothing that way  
'Cause it's too late,  
I'm gonna prove it to you  
Too late,  
I'll do what you want me to do  
Too late,  
You can't run anymore  
'Cause' it's too late for you now  
  
My heart is burning  
An' the fire is hot,  
My temperature is rising, rising, rising  
I'm ready to rock  
All or nothing  
I'm gonna make you see,  
I've made up my mind, for sure, this time  
You're gonna spend the night with me  
  
So don't try running away,  
You know you get nothing that way  
'Cause it's too late,  
I'm gonna prove it to you  
Too late,  
I'll do what you want me to do  
Too late,  
You can't run anymore  
'Cause it's too late for you now  
  
So don't try running away,  
You know you get nothing that way  
'Cause it's too late,  
I'm gonna prove it to you  
Too late,  
I'll do what you want me to do  
Too late,  
You can't run anymore

Too late,  
I'm gonna prove it to you  
Too late,  
I'll do what you want me to do  
Too late,  
You can't run anymore  
'Cause it's too late for you now

I know you, you know me  
I'm the black sheep of the family,  
I'm in an' out of trouble  
I'm the talk of the town  
I get wild in the street  
When the sun goes down  
I steal around, like a thief in the night  
Dancing 'til the break of day  
  
Bad boys,  
Running undercover of moonlight  
Bad, bad boys,  
Getting wild in the street,  
Wild in the city  
I see you, you see me  
Just a black street boy in society  
With high-heeled women full of champagne an' lies,  
Getting wild in the street  
'Til the hot sunrise  
Stealing round like a thief in the night  
Dancing 'til the break of day  
  
Bad boys,  
Running undercover of moonlight  
Bad, bad boys,  
Getting wild in the street,  
Wild in the city,  
Wild in the city,  
Wild in the city  
  
Bad, bad boys,  
Running undercover of moonlight  
Bad, bad boys,  
Getting wild in the street,  
Wild in the city  
  
I know you, you know me  
I'm the black sheep of the family,  
I'm in an' out of trouble  
I'm the talk of the town  
I get wild in the street  
When the sun goes down  
  
I don't care what the people think,  
I can't hear what the people say,  
I steal around like a thief in the night  
Dancing 'til the break of day  
  
Bad, bad boys,  
Running undercover of moonlight  
Bad, bad boys,  
Getting wild in the street,  
Bad, bad, bad boys,  
Running undercover of moonlight  
Bad, bad boys,  
Getting wild in the street,  
Wild in the city  
  
Undercover of moonlight

Come on baby  
  
I get so confused,  
But, my heart knows you're one of a kind  
Leather an' lace, an angels face,  
Riding on a one track mind  
You're fully loaded with cruise control,  
My four wheels rock with your back seat roll  
  
You're cheap an' nasty,  
All you want to do is give it up, give it up  
Cheap an' nasty,  
Come on an' do the dirty with me  
  
I get so excited, babe, when I'm invited  
To ride in your limousine,  
You drive it every day, burn it every night,  
I wonder how you keep it so clean  
Smooth accelerator, you get me so loose,  
You keep your motor running till I run out of juice  
  
You're cheap an' nasty,  
All you want to do is give it up, give it up  
Cheap an' nasty,  
Come on an' do the dirty with me  
  
Cheap an' nasty  
  
I never knew it could be this way  
An' I never thought I'd ever complain,  
But, gimme a second just to catch my breath  
Babe, before you do it again  
  
All the boys call your name  
Down the wishing well,  
Baby, when you go  
You're like a cat out of hell  
  
You're cheap an' nasty,  
All you want to do is give it up, give it up  
Cheap an' nasty,  
All you want to do is give it up, give it up  
Cheap an' nasty,  
All you want to do is give it up, give it up  
Cheap an' nasty,  
Come on an' do the dirty with me  
  
Come on an' do the dirty,  
Come on an' do the dirty,  
Come on an' do the dirty with me  
Come on an' do the dirty with me

When I heard the sound of thunder  
On the day that I was born,  
I was blinded by the lighting  
An' baptised in the storm  
My father started crying  
When he saw what he had done,  
But, my mother started praying  
Have mercy on my son,  
He is a child of Babylon  
  
I am a child of Babylon,  
Lord have mercy on a wayward son  
Nowhere to hide, nowhere to run  
I am a child,  
A child of Babylon  
  
When I've fooled around so many times  
When I've known it ain't been right,  
But, I paint it all in colours  
When it really should be black and white  
I sail my ship through muddy waters,  
Try to open every door,  
When I saw the seven wonders  
It left me wanting more  
  
I am a child of Babylon,  
Lord have mercy on a wayward son  
Nowhere to hide, got no place to run  
I am a child,  
A child of Babylon  
  
On my day of judgment  
I know how it will be,  
I'm prepared to meet my maker  
With no hope for charity  
I'll stand alone and pay the price  
For everything I've done,  
'Cause there ain't guardian angel  
For a child of Babylon  
  
I am a child,  
A child of Babylon  
I am a child of Babylon,  
Lord have mercy on a wayward son  
Nowhere to hide, got no place to run  
I am a child,  
A child of Babylon  
  
Child of Babylon

I don't go looking for trouble,  
It's always coming my way,  
But, I've been looking for you,  
And like the summer sun, you welcome my day.  
  
So come on, come on,  
And give your man some rock 'n' roll,  
And get yourself some sweet rock 'n' roll.  
  
I'm just a soldier of fortune,  
Must be the gypsy in me.  
I ain't along when I say  
I never needed love so badly before.  
  
Hear me singing "Come on, come on"!  
Give your man some rock 'n' roll,  
And get yourself some sweet rock 'n' roll.  
  
I keep singing, "Come on, come on"!  
"Come on, come on"!  
Give your man some rock 'n' roll,

Must be the gypsy in me,  
Can see the angel in you.

I don't need a doctor, I don't need a priest,  
I don't need no superstitious cures for my release  
I'm flesh an' blood, skin an' bone  
A little petticoat company can't get me stoned  
  
So just gimme the night,  
Skin it back to the bone,  
Turn on the spotlight  
  
C'mon, bring on the dancing girls,  
Bring on the dancing girls,  
Bring on the dancing girls  
You can dance, dance,  
Dance for me,  
Dance for your daddy all night  
  
I got a one track notion on a feminine squeeze,  
A sackful of love an' a mindful of fantasies  
A midnight rider on a stallion steam,  
I got an old man's weakness hanging on a young man's dream  
  
So just gimme the night,  
Skin it back to the bone,  
Turn on the spotlight  
  
C'mon, bring on the dancing girls,  
Bring on the dancing girls,  
Bring on the dancing girls  
You can dance, dance,  
Dance for me,  
Dance for your daddy all night  
  
So just gimme the night,  
Skin it back to the bone,  
Turn on the spotlight  
  
C'mon, bring on the dancing girls,  
Bring on the dancing girls

Got a good reason  
For taking the easy way out.  
Got a good reason  
For taking the easy way out.  
She was a day tripper,  
One way ticket, yeah.  
It took me so long to find out, and I found out.  
  
Day tripper, day tripper, day tripper.  
  
She's a big teaser,  
She took me half the way there.

Day tripper,  
Sunday driver, yeah.  
It took me so long to find out, and I found out.  
  
Day tripper, day tripper, day tripper.  
  
Got a good reason  
For taking the easy way out.  
Got a good reason  
For taking the easy way out.  
She was a day tripper,  
Sunday driver, yeah.  
It took me so long to find out, baby, and I found out.  
  
Day tripper

I'm gonna take it to the limit of my love,  
Before I turn and walk away  
I've had enough of holding on  
The promises of yesterday  
Every day of my life, it seems,  
Trouble's knocking at my door,  
It's hard to try and satisfy  
When you don't know what you're fighting for  
  
Time and again I sing your song,  
But, I've been runnin' on empty far too long  
I've had enough holdin' on to the past,  
Make no mistake, it could be your last  
  
Don't break my heart again, like you did before  
Don't break my heart again, I couldn't take anymore  
  
I never hide the feeling inside,  
And though I'm standing my back to the wall,  
I know that even in a summer love  
A little bit of rain must fall  
But, every road I take I know  
Where it's gonna lead me to,  
Because I've traveled every highway  
And they all keep coming back to you  
  
Time and again I sing your song,  
But, I've been runnin' on empty far too long  
I've had enough holdin' on to the past,  
Make no mistake, it could be your last  
  
Don't break my heart again, like you did before  
Don't break my heart again, I couldn't take anymore  
Don't break my heart  
  
Don't break my heart again, like you did before  
Don't break my heart again, I couldn't take anymore

As I stand at the crossroad,  
I see the sun sinking low  
With my cross of indecision,  
I can't tell which way to go  
Now I have seen the seven wonders  
And I have sailed the seven seas,  
I've walked and talked with angels,  
And danced all night with gypsy queens  
  
All in all it's been a rocky road,  
Twists and turns along the way  
But, I still pray for tomorrow,  
All my hopes, my dreams  
Don't fade away  
Don't fade away  
  
I have painted many portraits,  
Memories of love and pain,  
Though cut down by life's deceptions  
I found the strength to start again  
  
All in all it's been a rocky road,  
Twists and turns along the way  
But, I still pray for tomorrow,  
All my hopes, my dreams  
Don't fade away  
Don't fade away.  
  
Heaven help a man  
Trying to make up his mind,  
With the darkness closing in,  
I feel I'm running out of time  
Shine a light for me,  
Help me find the way to go,  
And take me where I've never been before  
  
And so I stand at the crossroad,  
Watching the sun sinking low  
With my cross of indecision,  
Trying to find the way to go  
  
All in all it's been a rocky road,  
Twists and turns along the way,  
But, I still pray for tomorrow  
All my hopes, my dreams  
Don't fade away

Fly like an eagle,  
An outlaw of the sun,  
Stealing 'round your bedroom door  
A case of hit 'n run.  
Sinner, sinner,  
I'm no angel you can see.  
  
So I will tell you now  
And I won't say it again,  
Don't mess with me  
Oh baby, don't mess with me.  
  
Ride like a demon,  
The devil's only son.  
A whiskey drinking son of a bitch,  
I've only just begun.  
Sinner, sinner,  
I'm no angel you can see.  
  
I told you once before  
And I won't say it again,  
Don't mess with me,  
Don't mess with me.  
  
Soothe me baby like I soothe you,  
Treat me baby like I treat you.  
Soothe me baby like I soothe you,  
Treat me baby like I  
  
Fly like an eagle  
An outlaw of the sun,  
Never take what sleeps around  
But, always get your fun.  
Sinner, sinner,  
You're no angel I can see.  
  
I told you once before  
And I won't say it again,  
Don't mess with me,  
Don't mess with me.  
'cause I'm a sinner  
  
And sinners ain't the loving kind.

You say your dreams are burned to ashes  
And your smiles have turned to tears,  
It seems to me you welcome sanest  
As you surrender to your fears  
  
So what's a man like me supposed to do  
When all I want is just to make love to you  
  
Don't turn away, before the night is over  
Don't turn away, before the night is gone  
Don't turn away, the night may hold the answer  
So don't turn away, before the night,  
Before the night is gone  
  
You say your heart is lost forever  
And you're always gonna give your love in vain  
So you paint yourself a lonely portrait  
And hide your love away again  
  
You turn away from what you feel inside,  
You can't forget all your foolish pride  
  
Don't turn away, before the night is over  
Don't turn away, before the night is gone  
Don't turn away, the night may hold the answer  
So don't turn away, before the night is gone  
  
So now I'm asking you this question  
Am I gonna give you all my love in vain  
Do you want to drown in your own sorrow  
Or are you gonna try to love again  
  
Don't turn away from what you feel inside,  
You should try to forget about all your foolish pride  
  
Don't turn away, before the night is over  
Don't turn away, before the night is gone  
Don't turn away, the night may hold the answer  
So don't turn away, before the night,  
Before the night,  
Before the night is gone  
  
Don't turn away from me baby,  
No, no, no, no.  
Don't put me away,  
Don't walk away from me darling  
I need your love,  
Oh baby,  
I need your love to rescue me,  
An' I'm coming for you, baby

You've got my love to keep you warm  
Give you shelter from the storm  
Any time you need  
Through the long and lonely night  
You got me to hold you tight  
My love is guaranteed  
You're everything I'm waiting for  
Now I don't have to look no more  
  
Take me as I am  
I'll do the best I can for your love  
It's easier said than done  
Take me by the hand  
Try to understand when I say  
It's easier said than done  
Sometimes I swim against the tide  
When I know you're by my side  
There ain't nothing I can't do  
Baby my heart's an open book  
Anytime you wanna look  
'Cause it's written just for you,oh whoa  
You're everything I'm waiting for  
Now I don't have to look no more  
  
Take me as I am  
I'll do the best I can for your love  
It's easier said than done  
Take me by the hand  
Try to understand when I say  
It's easier said than done  
  
You're everything I've waited for  
Now I don't have to look no more  
You're everything I want you to be  
Baby, baby won't you stay with me  
  
Take me as I'm  
I'll do the best I can for your love  
It's easier said than done  
Take me by the hand  
Try to understand when I say  
It's easier said than done  
It's easier said than done  
It's easier said than done  
It's easier said than done  
It's easier said than done  
It's easier said than done

I've been a gypsy  
For a thousand years  
A victim of circumstance  
I go wherever my destiny calls  
I'm caught in a game of chance  
  
I stand on the outside  
Looking at love  
I want to get inside  
I stand on the outside  
Looking at love  
Just trying to get inside  
  
No fame or fortune,  
No luck of the draw  
When I dance with Queen of Hearts  
A jack of all trades  
But, a loser in love  
It's tearing my soul apart  
  
Still I stand on the outside  
Looking at love  
I want to get inside  
I stand on the outside  
Looking in  
I stand on the outside  
Looking at love  
Just trying to get inside  
I stand on the outside  
Looking in  
  
The jack of diamonds  
An' the ace of spades  
Try to use me, and to abuse me  
It seems the dealer  
won't give me a chance  
I'm victim of circumstance  
  
So I stand on the outside  
Looking at love  
I want to get inside  
I stand on the outside  
Looking in  
So I stand on the outside  
Looking at love  
Just trying to get inside  
I stand on the outside  
Looking in

I want you  
I need your rhyme,  
But, you keep saying, babe,  
It's gonna take time  
I know the heartache  
I put you through,  
Believe me, babe,  
I'm gonna make it up to you  
  
You are the reason  
I'm down on my knees,  
I'm begging you to give me a chance  
If only you would  
Give me just a little more time,  
Give me just a little more time,  
Give me just a little more time,  
Give me just a little more time,  
To prove it to you  
  
So many feelings  
I can't explain,  
I never thought I'd ever cause you any pain  
Now I'm alone here  
An' I can't hide,  
The sun don't shine for me  
Without you by my side  
  
You are the reason  
I'm down on my knees,  
I'm begging you to give me a chance  
If only you would  
Give me just a little more time,  
Give me just a little more time,  
Give me just a little more time,  
Give me just a little more time  
To prove it to you  
  
An' I'm gonna prove it  
  
I want you  
Right by my side  
'Cause you're the only one who keeps me satisfied  
I need your loving,  
I need your charms,  
I can't stand the through of you  
In someone else's arms  
  
You are the reason  
I'm down on my knees,  
I'm begging you to give me a chance  
If only you would  
Give me just a little more time,  
Give me just a little more time,  
Give me just a little more time,  
Give me just a little more time  
To prove it to you  
An' I'm gonna prove it

I believe my love for you  
Is a love that will last forever,  
An' I'm here to testify  
I'm a prisoner of your heart  
Baby don't you believe  
When I tell you I love you  
That I really mean it,  
Don't you walk away,  
Don't you turn your back on me  
  
I'm guilty of love,  
It's a crime of passion  
Guilty of love,  
An' there's no doubt about it,  
No doubt about it  
  
I'm guilty of love,  
I'm guilty of love,  
I'm guilty,  
In the first degree  
Guilty of love,  
I'm guilty of love,  
I'm guilty,  
In the first degree  
  
I can never forget the times  
When I took what you gave me for granted  
So I stand accused  
An' I plead guilty to the crime  
You can lock me away if you want  
Just as long as your arms are around me,  
An' I won't mind  
If you just throw away the key  
  
I'm guilty of love,  
It's a crime of passion  
Guilty of love,  
An' there's no doubt about it,  
No doubt about it  
  
Guilty of love,  
I'm guilty of love,

Guilty of love,  
I'm guilty of love,  
I'm guilty,  
In the first degree

Help me through the day,  
Help me through the night  
Baby your sweet loving  
Will make everything all right  
  
Help me through tomorrow  
When stormy weather comes  
Lord make me realize  
That you're my woman  
  
I can see so much pain  
Deep inside your eyes  
I know the feeling,  
Someone hurts you  
When someone makes you cry  
  
Help me through the day,  
Help me through the night  
Babe you make me realize  
You're my woman  
  
Help me through the day,  
Help me through the night  
Baby your sweet loving  
Will make everything all right  
  
Help me through tomorrow  
When stormy weather comes  
Lord make me realize  
You're my woman,  
You're my woman  
  
Help me through the day  
And be my woman,  
Help me through the night  
And be my woman

I don't know where I'm goin'  
But I sure know where I've been  
Hanging on the promises in songs of yesterday  
An' I've made up my mind, I ain't wasting no more time  
Here I go again, here I go again  
  
Tho' I keep searching for an answer  
I never seem to find what I'm looking for  
Oh Lord, I pray you give me strength to carry on  
'Cause I know what it means to walk along the lonely street of dreams  
  
Here I go again on my own  
Goin' down the only road I've ever known  
Like a drifter I was born to walk alone  
An' I've made up my mind, I ain't wasting no more time  
  
Just another heart in need of rescue  
Waiting on love's sweet charity  
An' I'm gonna hold on for the rest of my days  
'Cause I know what it means to walk along the lonely street of dreams  
  
And here I go again on my own  
Goin' down the only road I've ever known  
Like a drifter I was born to walk alone  
An' I've made up my mind, I ain't wasting no more time  
But here I go again, here I go again,  
Here I go again, here I go  
  
'Cause I know what it means to walk along the lonely street of dreams  
Here I go again on my own  
Goin' down the only road I've ever known  
Like a drifter I was born to walk alone  
An' I've made up my mind, I ain't wasting no more time  
Here I go again on my own  
Goin' down the only road I've ever known  
Like a drifter I was born to walk alone  
'Cause I know what it means to walk along the lonely street of dreams  
  
Here I go again on my own  
Goin' down the only road I've ever known  
Like a drifter I was born to walk alone

I've never had a home sweet home life  
An' I don't want a nine to five,  
So many women I know  
Think they can tie me down,  
But, I will never let them take me alive  
I hit an' run, hit an' run, hit an' run, hit an' run, hit an' run.  
  
Now some women say they don't want nothing,  
But a sweet talkin' bull of a man,  
I've heard it before, I can't hear it no more  
'cause they all take whatever they can,  
  
But, still I want a heartbreaker,  
A love maker, a soul shaker,  
A women who can turn me on,  
For a just little hit an' run, hit an' run  
  
She can be a love stealer,  
A double dealer, a free wheeler  
As long as she can turn me on  
For just a little hit an' run,  
A little bit of hit an' run  
  
You can keep your lock and key  
No ball and chain can harness me.  
Take me home tonight,  
Love and treat me right  
But, in the morning you'll find me gone,  
I hit an' run.  
  
Hit an' run

I'm ready for you,  
Are you ready for me  
I've got a burning heart,  
It won't let me be  
I feel the hunger, my spirit yearns,  
I've got to feed the fever  
Of a love that burns  
  
I walk the street 'round midnight,  
Looking for a little hot stuff,  
I can't get enough  
I just can't get enough, hot stuff,  
Hot stuff, hot stuff  
  
I'm hard to handle,  
Too hot to hold  
I can't seem to satisfy  
My heart an' soul  
I need a woman to set me free,  
A little Miss Understanding  
To feel the need in me  
  
I walk the street 'round midnight,  
Looking for a little hot stuff,  
I can't get enough,  
I just can't get enough, hot stuff,  
Can't get enough, hot stuff,  
I just can't get enough, hot stuff,  
Can't get enough  
  
I'm ready for you,  
Are you ready for me  
I've got a burning heart,  
It won't let me be  
I feel the hunger, my spirit yearns,  
I've got to feed the fever  
Of a love that burns  
  
I walk the street 'round midnight  
Looking for a little hot stuff,  
I can't get enough,  
I just can't get enough, hot stuff,  
Can't get enough, hot stuff,  
Can't get enough, hot stuff,  
Hot stuff, hot stuff,  
Hot stuff, hot stuff,  
Hot stuff, hot stuff,  
Hot stuff, hot stuff,  
I just can't get enough, hot stuff,  
I just can't get enough, hot stuff,  
Can't get enough, hot stuff,  
I just can't get enough, hot stuff  
  
Hot stuff, can't get enough hot stuff

I keep hangin' on the promise of love  
Your eyes tell me that I'm gonna see  
I feel the hunger like a starving man  
Honey, when you stand close to me  
  
I start to shiver, I start to shake,  
Chills up an' down my spine,  
I'm in the mood for action  
In need of satisfaction,  
Babe, I'm gonna make you mine  
  
Now I believe in you,  
An' everything that you do  
'Cause I'm hungry for love,  
I'm hungry for love, I'm hungry for love,  
I can't get enough, I can't get enough, I can't get enough  
  
I've got the weakness of an ordinary man  
I need the comfort of womanly mind,  
But, I get nervous when I think about  
So many women an' so little time  
  
But, I believe in you,  
An' everything you do  
'Cause I'm hungry for love,  
I'm hungry for love, I'm hungry for love,  
I can't get enough, I can't get enough, I can't get enough  
  
I start to shiver, I start to shake,  
Chills up an' down my spine,  
I get so nervous when I think about  
So many women an' not enough time  
  
But, I believe in you,  
An' everything that you do  
'Cause I'm hungry for love,  
I'm hungry for love, I'm hungry for love,  
I can't get enough, I can't get enough, I can't get enough  
I'm hungry for love, I'm hungry for love, I'm hungry for love,  
I can't get enough, I can't get enough, I can't get enough,  
I can't get enough, I can't get enough, I can't get enough  
  
I'm hungry for love

I should have known better  
Than to let you go alone  
It's times like these  
I can't make it on my own  
Wasted days, and sleepless nights  
An' I can't wait to see you again  
  
I find I spend my time  
Waiting on your call  
How can I tell you, babe  
My back's against the wall  
I need you by my side  
To tell me it's alright  
'Cause I don't think I can take anymore  
  
Is this love that I'm feeling  
Is this the love that I've been searching for  
Is this love or am I dreaming  
This must be love  
'Cause it's really got a hold on me  
A hold on me  
  
I can't stop the feeling  
I've been this way before  
But, with you I've found the key  
To open any door  
I can feel my love for you  
Growing stronger day by day  
An' I can't wait too see you again  
So I can hold you in my arms  
  
Is this love that I'm feeling  
Is this the love that I've been searching for  
Is this love or am I dreaming  
This must be love  
'Cause it's really got a hold on me  
A hold on me  
  
Is this love that I'm feeling  
Is this the love that I've been searching for  
  
Is this love or am I dreaming

The night is gone,  
The time has come  
To find a new day has begun,  
An' it promises to stay  
To soothe the pain of wasted years  
An' kiss away the bitter tears  
A love to light the way  
  
And from the darkness  
Comes a smile,  
That reaches out for many miles,  
Touching everyone.  
No more shadows of the past,  
Your spirit free to fly at last,  
Shining in the sun  
  
Like the rolling thunder,  
I feel the power of love,  
It's a gift from heaven  
And the Lord above  
  
We walk toward desire,  
Hand and hand  
Through fields of fire  
With only love to light the way  
On the road to Judgement Day  
  
Take it easy, take it slow,  
I'll take you anywhere you want to go,  
Places never seen before  
'Cause I love you, an' I need you,  
I'll do my best to please you,  
My love can open any door  
  
When you hear the thunder  
In your darkest night,  
I'll be there to hold you  
When the lightning strikes  
  
So don't you worry,  
You can ease your mind  
'Cause we'll be dancing  
At the end of time  
  
Who loves you, who needs you,  
Who'll do his best to please you,  
I love you, I need you  
I'll get down on my knees  
  
We walk toward desire,  
Hand and hand  
Through fields of fire  
With only love to light the way  
On the road to Judgement Day  
  
So don't you worry, baby  
On the road to Judgement Day  
Who loves you, who needs you  
On the road to Judgement Day  
  
So I love you, and I need you  
My love can open any door  
My love can open any door

Oh, you told me you were burned by holy water,  
And the priest forgot the words  
He was trying to say.  
It seems your best friend  
Is your own reflection,  
And no promise of love  
Is gonna make you want to stay.  
  
I don't mind,  
You can think it over slow,  
And tell me what you find.  
I'm marking time,  
If you got love to give,  
Baby, I don't mind.  
  
Keep on giving me loving,  
Keep on giving me loving,  
Keep on giving me loving,  
Keep on giving me love.  
  
You got fox eyes,  
They burn like a sunrise,  
You got a walk that makes a mans' blood turn to wine.  
You bought and sold me  
For you lover,  
As long as you feed me good, baby, I don't mind.  
  
I don't mind,  
You can think it over slow,  
And tell me what you find.  
I'm marking time,  
If you got love to give,  
Baby, I don't mind.  
  
Keep on giving me loving,  
Keep on giving me loving,  
Keep on giving me loving,  
Keep on giving me love.

Walking down the street  
You're the center of my universe  
You got the world in your pocket,  
My manhood in your purse  
You ain't a bad girl, honey,

You got the smile of a Monalisa,  
Know it all an' giving nothing away.  
You make the sins of a vestal virgin,  
Look nothing more that a roll in the hay.  
  
So lie down, I think I love you,  
Lie down, I think I care.  
Lie down, I think I love you,  
Lie down, I think I care.  
  
You give an air of the Dolce Vita,  
Society's made a queen out of you.  
Casanova couldn't take all your virtue,  
But, rock 'n' roll is gonna steal it from you.  
  
So lie down, I think I love you,  
Lie down, I think I care.  
Lie down, I think I love you,  
Lie down, I think I care.  
  
Come on, girl, it'll be alright,  
Easy does it nice and slow.  
Woah, you know, mama, that tonight's the night,  
Come on and let your feelings show.  
  
Take a look in the mirror,  
Tell me what you see.  
If it ain't sweet surrender  
You can blame it on somebody, not the devil in me.

I've been burning my bridges  
For too many years,  
Drowning the sorrow  
Of too many tears  
Women and whiskey  
Are my only friends,  
One gives me strength,  
One just pretends  
  
I've been waiting my whole life  
For things to work out right,  
But, those lonely days turn into lonely nights  
Yes, it do  
  
I've heard all the wisdom  
Of prophets and seers,  
It don't soothe my passion  
And it don't ease my fears  
Burned by love  
And blinded by snow,  
Bad luck and trouble  
Are with me wherever I go  
  
I've been waiting my whole life  
For things to work out right,  
But those lonely days turn into lonely nights  
Lonely days, lonely nights,  
Lonely days, lonely nights  
  
Lonely days, lonely nights,  
Someday babe, it's gonna be alright  
Lonely days, lonely nights,  
Someday babe, it's gonna be alright for me, for me  
  
Lonely days, lonely nights,  
Someday babe, it's gonna be alright

I would do anything I could to be near you,  
Walk all night in the pouring rain  
To be at your side  
My heart is aching for love,  
My body's shaking with desire  
Believe me, baby, when I say  
I will drink you dry  
  
I would do anything to be near you,  
You're everything any man could claim  
I see your face in the night,  
I hear you calling my name  
  
But, it's a long long way from home,  
I'm just trying to get a message to you,  
It's a long long way from home,  
An' I don't know what I'm gonna do  
  
I'd been looking for love for so long when I found you,  
Too many years I walked alone  
When I touch you inside I feel you burning me with fire,  
Believe me baby when I say  
I will feed the flame  
  
I would do anything to be near you,  
Walk all night in the pouring rain

I'm tired of waiting  
An' closing my eyes  
I'm asking myself  
Why is it all my horizons  
Are so far away  
  
I look in the mirror  
Don't like what I see  
In my reflection  
A stranger is staring at me  
Looking for love  
  
The love of a woman  
The needs of a man  
I try so hard to believe  
But I don't understand  
The search goes on  
  
But over the mountains  
Across the sea  
I know love is waiting  
I hear it calling to me  
Calling my name  
  
I'm looking for love all around me  
Looking for love to surround me  
The love that I need  
To rescue the state of my heart  
  
Alone again, It's always the same  
I've just been marking my time  
Since the day I was born  
With no one to blame  
  
The candle is burning  
It's way down low  
I just need someone  
To show me the way to go  
Which way to go.  
  
I'm looking for love all around me  
Looking for love to surround me  
The love that I need  
To rescue the state of my heart  
  
I'm looking for love  
An' finding only heartache  
Looking for love  
An' finding only heartache  
I'm looking for love to rely on  
Looking for love, a shoulder to cry on  
I'm looking for love  
To rescue the state of my heart.

I got more than I asked for,  
There ain't nothin' I need.  
I took all 'til I had more,  
I'm always takin' the lead  
  
Old man shakin' dice down on the street,  
Try'n to make a livin' somehow  
But I'm really sure about gettin' things sorted out  
And I'm gettin' ready right now  
  
You can't hold me,  
I have told you  
Might just take your life,  
Might just take your life  
  
I've been called by many names  
And all of them are bad  
I can take it all the same,  
It's all I've ever had  
  
I've got somethin' that you can't get  
But one thing you can see  
Gettin' there ain't easy  
But it sure was hard for me  
  
You can't hold me,  
I have told you  
Might just take your life,  
Might just take your life  
  
Every time I take a look  
There's someone close behind  
They never used to make a pass,  
The things that crossed their minds  
  
Now they tell me that it's all right  
And they want to be my friend  
They're ridin' on my back  
When is it goin' to end?  
  
You can't hold me,  
I have told you  
Might just take your life,  
Might just take your life,  
Might just take your life  
  
Got more than I asked for,  
Got more than I need  
Got more than I asked for,  
Got more than I need  
Got more than I asked for,  
Got more than I need

I need someones hand  
To lead me through the night  
Need someones arms  
To hold and squeeze me tight  
When the night begins  
I'm at an end  
'Cause I need your love so bad  
Need some lips to feel next to mine  
Need someone to stand up  
And tell my when I'm lying  
When the lights are low  
And it's time to go  
That's when I need your love so bad  
So why don't you give it up  
And bring it on home to me  
Or write it on a piece of paper, baby  
So it can be read to me  
Tell me that you love me  
Stop driving me mad  
Because I need your love so bad  
I need a soft voice  
To talk to me at night  
Don't won't to worry, baby  
I know we'll make everything alright  
Listen to my plea, yeah  
Bring it to me  
'Cause I need your love so bad  
Because I need your love so bad  

Now you're gone  
I can feel my heart is breaking,  
An' I can't go on  
When I think of the love that you've taken  
  
In the night I pray for your embrace,  
Every time I close my eyes  
I can't escape your face  
You're out of sight,  
But, always on my mind,  
I never realized  
My love could be so blind  
  
You're all I want,  
Can't you feel the love  
In this heart of mine  
You're all I need,  
So maybe we could turn back  
The hands of time,  
Maybe we could give it another try  
One more time  
  
But, now you're gone  
There's an emptiness closing around me,  
An' I can't go on  
When all I have left is the memory  
  
In the night I call out your name,  
I wake up in a cold sweat  
An' I'm all alone again  
I need your love  
Much more than I can say,  
I realize without you  
I can't face another day  
  
You're all I want,  
Can't you feel the love  
In this heart of mine  
You're all that I need,  
Since I lost you, girl,  
I've been losing my mind  
You're all that I want,  
So maybe we could turn back  
The hands of time,  
Maybe we could give it  
Another try  
One more time,  
Baby, just one more time  
  
Now you're gone  
I can feel my heart is breaking,  
An I can't go on  
When all of my love has been taken  
  
You're all I want,  
Can't you feel the love  
In this heart of mine  
You're all that I need,  
Since I lost you, girl,  
I've been losing my mind  
  
You're all I want,  
Can't you feel the love  
In this heart of mine  
You're all that I need,  
Since I lost you, girl,  
I've been losing my mind.

Only my soul, stops me crying,  
Wondering why I feel alone.  
And only my love keeps me from  
Weeping, so bad,  
Giving me strength, to carry on.  
  
Lead me on thro' restless waters,  
Walk with me along the way.  
Live the moment, and tomorrow.  
For the Lord will take it all  
On judgment day.  
  
Broken dreams lay all around me,  
Sad eyed children of despair.  
Whispered voices in the distance  
Call me on to who knows where.  
  
Lead me on thro' restless waters,  
Walk with me along the way.  
Live the moment, and tomorrow.  
'Cause the Lord will take it all on judgment day,  
And the Lord will take it all on judgement day.  
  
Hear me crying out for love.  
Hear me crying out for love.  
I'll never let you know it,  
I can only show it in my song.  
  
Only my soul.  
  
Hear me crying out for love.  
Hear me crying out for love.  
I'll never let you know it,  
I can only show it in my song.  
Only my soul

When I left my home  
I was not much more than a child,  
My mother started crying  
She knew that I was born to be wild  
  
'Cuse I was looking for the bright lights of the big city,  
A red hot town where the girls are pretty  
  
I took to the highway,  
Chasing my dream down the line  
Heading out for trouble,  
Never finding my peace of mind  
'Cause I been run out of town so many times before  
An' usually kind of places where I can't go back no more  
  
Outlaw, born outside of the law,  
Just another outlaw,  
Man on the run will always take chances for fun  
  
I never find it easy trying to keep the feeling alive,  
I've always been a dreamer,  
Dreamers find it hard to survive  
When they're living in the bright lights of the big city,  
A red hot town where the girls are pretty  
  
Outlaw, born outside of the law,  
Just another outlaw,  
Man on the run will always take chances for fun  
Outlaw, born outside of the law,  
Just another outlaw,  
Man on the run will always take chances for fun  
  
Outlaw, born outside of the law,  
Just another outlaw,  
Man on the run will always take chances for fun  
Born outside of the law,  
Just another outlaw,  
Man on the run will always take chances for fun  
Outlaw, outlaw,  
Man on the run will always take chances for fun

She was the keeper of all my reason,  
Possessor of all I owned,  
She kept me on the edge of darkness  
With words as cold as stone.  
Then you came along,  
Your eyes were flashing with desire,  
Oh babe, you got me burning, so much  
You got my soul on fire.  
  
Honey, you move me,  
You got me so I can't sleep at night,  
You tell me you believe in me,  
And you say you're gonna treat me right.  
  
You gave me the answer,  
I knew right from the start.  
I'm gonna tell you, holy roller,  
They say that love's a gamble,  
But, I got the Queen of Hearts.  
  
If I could touch the crystal silence  
That we have after making love,  
Just to tell you I need you here  
In the glow of the stars above.  
  
If you ever leave, or deceive,  
Or fool around,  
You could be right,  
You could be wrong,  
But, woman, I know I'll miss you  
When you're gone.  
  
Honey, you move me,  
Like the wind thro' a willow tree.  
Ain't no doubt about it, baby,  
You make the blind man see.  
  
You gave me the answer,  
I knew right from the start.  
I'm gonna tell you, holy Roller,  
They say that love's a gamble,  
But, I got the Queen of Hearts.  
  
You drive me crazy when you walk,  
Crazy when you talk,  
Crazy when you walk with me.  
  
You gave me the answer,  
I knew right from the start.  
I'm gonna tell you, holy roller,  
Gonna tell you, holy roller,  
You're the Queen of Hearts.  
  
You gave me the answer,  
I knew right from the start.  
I'm gonna tell you, holy roller,  
You're the Queen of Hearts

Restless heart, restless mind,  
I'm tired of wasting,  
My precious time.  
  
There are times in my life,  
I don't know witch way to turn,  
When everything I touch  
I get my fingers burned  
Dreams to ashes, ashes to dust,  
When all that glitters  
Is dull with rust  
  
Restless heart, restless mind,  
I'm tired of wasting,  
My precious time  
  
I'm torn and tattered,  
Shattered and worn,  
I've had enough  
Trying to live my life  
In the eye of the storm  
Every heartache  
Leaves a scar on my face,  
Somebody reach out  
Or throw me a line,  
Get me out of this place  
  
Restless heart, restless mind,  
I'm tired of wasting, wasting,  
My precious time  
  
Oh, so tired.  
  
Restless heart, restless mind,  
I'm tired of wasting,  
My precious time  
  
Restless heart, restless mind,

All of my precious time  
  
Restless heart, restless mind,  
So I'm tired of wasting, wasting,  
All of my precious time, time, time  
  
Restless heart

Do you remember  
Standing on the shore,  
Head in the clouds,  
Your pockets filled with dreams  
Bound for glory  
On the seven seas of life,  
But, the ocean is deeper than it seems  
  
The wind was with you  
When you left on the morning tide,  
You set your sail for an island in the sun,  
On the horizon, dark clouds up ahead,  
For the storm has just begun  
  
Take me with you,  
Take me far away,  
Lead me to the distant shore  
  
Sail your ship across the water,  
Spread your wings across the sky  
Take the time to see  
You're the one who holds the key,  
Or sailing ships will pass you by  
  
You cry for mercy,  
When you think you've lost your way,  
You drift alone, if all your hope is gone  
So find the strength and you will see  
You control, your destiny,  
After all is said and done  
  
So take me with you,  
Take me far away,  
An' lead me to the distant shore  
  
Sail your ship across the water,  
Spread your wings across the sky  
Take the time to see  
You're the one who holds the key,  
Or sailing ships will pass,  
Sailing ships will pass you,  
Sailing ships will pass you by  
  
Take me with you,  
Take me far away,  
We'll ride the wind across the sky  
Spread your wings and you will see  
You control, your destiny,  
So sailing ships don't pass you by  
  
So take me with you,  
Take me far away,  
We'll ride the wind across the sky  
Spread your wings and you will see  
You control, your destiny,  
So sailing ships don't pass,  
So sailing ships don't pass you,  
So sailing ships don't pass you by  
  
Baby, baby, baby, baby,  
You'll find that you're the only one  
Can sail your ship across the sky

Get ready for Judgment day  
An' the final curtain call,  
Don't lie when you testify  
'Cause the good Lord know you're all  
  
Saints an' sinners, priests an' thieves,  
Saints an' sinners, priests an' thieves  
  
When Moses stood on the Red Sea shore  
Laying the Law on the line,  
He said don't come knocking  
On the Pearly Gates  
If all you did was have a real good time  
  
Saints an' sinners, priests an' thieves,  
Saints an' sinners, priests an' thieves  
  
For what we are about to receive  
May the Lord make us truly thankful.  
  
Saints an' sinners  
  
I stand guilty of a thousand crimes,  
An' I suffer temptation still,  
Show me a man who won't give it to his woman  
An' I'll show you somebody who will  
  
Saints an' sinners, priests an' thieves,  
Saints an' sinners, priests an' thieves  
  
For what we are about to receive  
May the Lord make us truly thankful  
  
Saints an' sinners,  
Saints an' sinners, priests an' thieves,  
  
Get ready for Judgment day  
An' the final curtain call,  
Don't lie when you testify  
'cause the Good Lord know you're all  
  
Saints an' sinners, priests an' thieves,  
Saints an' sinners, priests an' thieves  
  
For what we are about to receive  
May the Lord make us truly thankful  
  
Saints an' sinners, priests an' thieves  
  
Saints an' sinners

You talk too much,  
Never saying what's on your mind,  
It's written on your face,  
An' in the words you hide behind  
I know what you want,  
I can see what you're looking for,  
I know what you want from me,  
An' I'm gonna give you more  
  
I'm gonna slide it in  
Right to the top,  
Slide it in,  
I ain't never gonna stop  
Slide it in,  
Right to the top,  
I'm gonna slide it in, slide it in,  
Slide it, in baby  
  
Sometimes you seem  
Just like a stranger to me,  
But, all the games you play  
Make it so easy to see  
You're looking for love,  
Tho' you try to deny,  
The things you put me through  
Tell me what I've got to do to you  
  
I'm gonna slide it in,  
Right to the top,  
Slide it in,  
I ain't never gonna stop  
Slide it in,  
Right to the top,  
I'm gonna slide it in, slide it in  
  
You talk too much,  
Always treating me so unkind,  
I know what I've got to do,  
To get me some peace of mind  
  
I'm gonna slide it in,  
Right to the top,  
Slide it in,  
I ain't never gonna stop  
Slide it in,  
Right to the top,  
I'm gonna slide it in, slide it in,  
Slide it in,  
Right to the top  
Slide it in,  
I ain't never gonna stop  
Slide it in,  
Right to the top,  
I'm gonna slide it in, slide it in, slide it,  
Slide it in, slide it in,  
Right to the top, baby.

She got everything I need,  
She makes me smile, she makes me bleed  
'Cause she's a woman  
  
She got the end, she got the means,  
She's in my heart and in my dreams  
An' it makes me cry I want to make her mine  
  
She ain't black, but, she got soul,  
She ain't young, she ain't old,  
She shine like silver, burn like gold  
'Cause she's a woman, she's a woman

She got comfort, she got speed  
She's a woman, she's a woman

She ain't young, she ain't old,  
Shine like silver, burn like gold  
She's a woman, she's a woman  
  
She got a fire in her eyes,  
I know she sees through all my lies,  
'Cause she's a woman, she's a woman  
  
I know I'm the danger zone  
If I leave her all alone  
'Cause she's a woman, she's a woman  
  
She ain't black, but, she got soul,  
She ain't young, she ain't old,  
Shine like silver, burn like gold

She shine like silver, burn like gold  
'Cause she's a woman, she's a woman  
  
She's a woman

Sometime after midnight, the heat begins to rise  
Girl you'd shame the devil with the look that's in your eyes  
I know what's on your mind and I can't run away  
If I don't give you what you want there's gonna be some hell to pay  
  
Creeping up behind me, knocking at my door  
I'd never be too blind to see just what you're looking for  
You roll me over, make me moan  
Ooh, such a velvet touch, you'd melt a heart of stone  
  
[Chorus]  
Anytime, anyplace, I'm just the fool who puts a smile on your face  
A slave to love and keep you young  
All it takes and no mistakes is just a slip of the tongue  
  
And if I want a little love I gotta take a little pain  
Make me think a thousand times before I kiss again  
I'm waiting on your, every day and every night  
If I don't try to satisfy there's gonna be a fist fight  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The sun is slowly rising and I'm sinking to my knees  
I'm dying just to close my eyes, I'm begging, darlin' please  
I hear you calling and I'm crawling cross the floor  
I give you everything I got and still you ask for more  
  
[Chorus]

Why know the joint was jumping  
Like a dancing fool,  
I saw you standing in the corner  
Looking oh, so cool  
I had a word with the DJ  
To make the music hot,  
I'm gonna get you on the dance floor  
If you are ready or not  
  
Slow poke music,  
I'll get you down to the bone  
Slow poke music,  
I'll never leave you alone, I'll never leave you  
  
When you move it to the left,  
Or you shake it to the right,  
No matter what you do, babe,  
It's like dynamite  
With your sweet French perfume  
An' that criminal walk,  
You know you'd melt my ice cream  
With your body talk  
  
Slow poke music,  
I'll get you down to the bone  
Slow poke music,  
I'll never leave you alone, I'll never leave you  
  
I'm gonna shake you down,  
Girl, I'm won't do you no harm  
  
Well, you move so fine,  
Like stepping on glass,  
An' when you give me that smile,  
I see lightning flash  
East an' West, North an' South,  
Oh babe, you're so hot  
I'm gonna melt in your mouth  
  
Slow poke music,  
I'll get you down to the bone  
Slow poke music,  
Get into it, babe,  
Slow poke music,  
I'll nail it down to the bone  
Slow poke music,  
Baby, baby, baby, baby  
Girl, I'll never leave you alone

Where did you go  
When things went wrong, baby,  
And who did you run to,  
To find a shoulder  
To lay your head upon.  
Baby, wasn't I there,  
Didn't I take good care of you.  
  
Oh no, I can't believe you leaving me  
  
Stay with me, baby,  
Stay with me, baby  
Won't you stay with me, baby,  
I can't go on  
  
Who did you touch  
When you need tenderness.  
I gave so much  
And in return I found happiness.  
Baby, what did I do  
Maybe I was too good, too good for you.  
  
No, no, I can't believe you leaving me.  
  
Stay with me, baby,  
Stay with me, baby.  
Won't you stay with me, baby,  
I can't go on.  
  
Remember,  
You said you're always gonna need me,  
Remember,  
You said you'd never, ever leave me,  
Remember, remember, I'm asking you, begging you.  
  
Stay with me, baby,  
Stay with me, baby  
Won't you stay with me, baby,  
I can't go on, can't go on  
  
Stay with me, baby,  
Stay with me, stay with me, baby.  
Won't you stay with me, baby,  
I can't go on

And when the day is done  
I'll find you woman, and run,  
Don't ask no question.  
And you won't get no lies,  
And if you steal away,  
I'll be your only lover.  
And I will love you till the day that I die.  
  
And if you steal away,  
I'll turn your night into day  
And get you crying like a dog for a bone.  
And if you say you will,  
I'll be your only lover.  
And if you're good,  
I'll never leave you alone.  
  
Now, woman, don't be shy,  
I see that look in your eye,  
A little snake-bite won't do nobody wrong.  
And if you shake what you got  
I'll be your only lover,  
And I'll be howling for you all night long.  
  
Steal away, steal away,  
Steal away, steal away.  
  
And if you steal away,  
I'll turn your night into day  
Don't ask no question,  
And you won't get no lies.  
And if you say you will,  
I'll be your only lover.  
And I will love you  
'Til the day that I die.

In the still of the night  
I hear the wolf howl, honey  
Sniffing around your door  
In the still of the night  
I feel my heart beating heavy  
Telling me I gotta have more  
  
In the shadow of night  
I see the full moon rise  
Telling me what's in store,  
My heart start aching  
My body start a shaking  
And I can't take no more, no, no  
  
Now I just want to get close to you  
An' taste your love so sweet  
And I just want to make love to you  
Feel your body heat  
  
In the still of the night  
In the still of the night  
Over here baby  
  
In the heat of the day  
I hang my head down low  
And hide my face from the sun  
Through the light of the day  
Until the evening time  
I'm waiting for the night to come  
  
In the still of the night,  
In the cool moonlight,  
I feel heart is aching  
In the still of the night  
  
Tell me here baby  
  
In the still of the night  
I hear the wolf howl, honey  
Sniffing around your door  
In the still of the night  
I feel my heart beating heavy  
Telling me I gotta have more.  
  
Now I just want to get close to you  
An' taste your love so sweet  
And I just want to make love to you  
Feel your body heat.  
  
In the still of the night  
  
Still of the night,  
Still of the night,  
Still of the night.

You hold all the aces,  
I never get the chance to deal  
Flick of the wrist and you cut me down,  
I'm spinning like a roulette wheel  
  
You say that love's a gamble  
But, you play with loaded dice  
You hide behind a good girl smile  
With a heart stone cold as ice  
  
But, I want it, I need it  
If you don't give it I'll steal it,  
I'll take it all and walk away  
Lady luck,  
You're a loser in the game of love, sweet lady luck  
Who you gonna call when it all falls down on you,  
Sweet lady luck  
  
You can't stop your dealing  
'cause it's a crying shame,  
When the winner takes it all  
And never ever takes the blame  
  
But I want it, I need it  
If you don't give it I'll steal it,  
I'll take it all and walk away  
Lady luck,  
You're a loser in the game of love, sweet lady luck  
Who you gonna call when it all falls down on you  
Uh, what you gonna do?  
Lady luck  
  
I need your love, I need it now,  
I've got to have it anyhow,  
Sweet lady luck  
  
I can't win for losing,  
It's tearing me apart  
So I'll play the joker to your queen of broken hearts  
  
But, I want it, I need it,  
If you don't give it I'll steal it  
I'll take it all and walk away  
Lady luck,  
You're a loser in the game of love, sweet lady luck  
Spinning like a roulette wheel, sweet lady luck

You give it all away  
By the sweet way that you talk, yes you do  
  
You got long legs, a black girl sway,  
The way you shake your booty  
Gives your schoolgirl game away, yes it does  
  
You're just a sweet talker, bad daughter,  
An' you've just begun  
The bitch is in heat,  
So you better run  
  
I know you know  
You got what it takes,  
You got the fever,  
But, you give me the shakes, yes you do  
  
Straight out of Lolita  
With nothing to lose,  
When I got your number  
My juke box blew a fuse, yes it did  
  
You're just sweet talker, bad daughter,  
An' you've just begun  
The bitch is in heat,

Now I smoke a lot of cigarettes,  
And I've been drinking too much wine  
You've been patient and understanding,  
I guess I went to far this time  
I cut you with my drunken words,  
So much sharper than a knife,  
But, you turned the tables on me, baby,  
Just by walking out of my life  
  
Too late to say I'm sorry,  
It won't happen anymore  
But, you don't believe a word I say  
'Cause you've heard it all before  
But, all the same,  
Won't you take me back again  
  
Don't say it's over,  
After all that we've been through  
Take some time to think about it, baby,  
While I sing my song to you  
Your suitcase by the back door,  
Packed with broken dreams,  
When night time comes to call on me,  
I'll know what loneliness means  
But, all the same,  
Won't you take me back again  
  
Take me back again, take me back again  
All I'm asking is forgiveness,  
Won't you take me back again  
Take me back again, take me back again  
All I'm asking is forgiveness,  
Won't you take me back again  
  
But, baby, all the same  
Won't you take me back again  
Take me back again, take me back again  
  
But, baby, all the same  
Won't you take me back again  
Take me back again, take me back again  
Won't you take me back again  
No, no, no, no, take me back again  
  
Don't walk away from me baby  
I beggin' you please, uh  
I beggin' you please, uh  
Take me back again  
Take me back again

When ice cold winds of winter  
Chill me to the bone,  
An' thoughts of summer breezes  
Turn my heart to stone  
That's when I need a hand to guide me,  
When it's more than I can bear  
A shoulder I can cry on,  
Someone to lead me there  
  
An' give me love,  
Give me love,  
Give me love  
Till the day I die,  
Till the day I die  
  
Slowly I awaken  
To the Weavers plan for me,  
To drift upon the waters  
Of my own uncertainty,  
To look for a companion  
Who will share my destiny,  
A guiding hand to understand  
An' walk to road with me  
  
An' give me love,  
Give me love,  
Give me love  
Till the day I die,  
Till the day I die  
  
I want to be the master of my destiny,  
I never want to crawl an' beg for no sympathy,  
When everything I have is yours,  
An' all I ask of you  
  
Is give me love.  
Give me love,  
Give me love  
Till the day I die,  
Till the day I die  
  
I never want to be the first  
To show I'm down,  
But, I'm never gonna wear the frozen smile of a clown  
When everything I have is yours  
And all I ask of you  
  
Is give me love  
Give me love,  
Give me love  
Till the day I die,  
Till the day I die  
  
Give me love,  
Give me love,  
Give me love.  
'Til the day I die  
Give me love,  
Give me love,  
Give me love.  
Till the day I die  
  
Till the day I die

On an' on, the road goes on,  
An' it'll go on forever,  
Time will show if you and I  
Will walk that road together  
Through fire an' water, ice an' snow,  
Heaven above us, an' hell below,  
Holding on, trying to walk the line  
With sweet temptation running close behind  
  
I'm talking 'bout love  
Ooh, love  
  
Like a fire forever burning,  
A flaming heart that's yearning, more an' more  
A love to keep us warm  
On the wings of the storm  
  
Everyday an' every night  
I keep hoping it'll be all right,  
Trying to leave the past behind,  
Still looking for some peace of mind  
But, destiny brought us together  
An' promised us a time that would last forever  
Tho' it's all been said before  
It's the kind of love worth fighting for  
  
I'm talking about love  
Ooh, love  
  
Like a fire forever burning,  
A flaming heart that's yearning, more an' more  
A love to keep you warm  
On the wings of the storm  
  
On an' on, the road goes on,  
An' it'll go on forever,  
Time will show if you and I  
Will walk that road together  
  
I'm talking about love  
Ooh, love  
  
Like a fire forever burning,  
A flaming heart that's yearning, more an' more  
A love to keep us warm  
On the wings of the storm  
My love will keep you warm  
On the wings of the storm

The woman's name was trouble,  
She put the blame on me  
I asked her what her game was,  
She said "Misery"  
I didn't ask no questions,  
I did not even pray  
When the angel on my shoulder  
Said I should walk away  
  
You promised me heaven,  
But, you gave me hell,  
Cut me down to the bone  
With your kiss and tell  
Nobody listens to a word I say,  
Still I'm gonna curse you, woman,  
'Til my dying day  
  
I should have known better  
With a girl like you  
You shame the devil  
With the things you do  
I was blind, now I see  
A lying woman be the death of me  
  
I got woman trouble blues,  
Woman trouble blues  
  
You told me it was meant to be,  
But, all you did was put the hurt on me  
You made my life a living hell,  
And drowned my dreams in the wishing well  
  
I've got woman trouble blues,  
Woman trouble blues  
  
There ain't no doubt I'm going down  
  
The woman's name was trouble,  
She put the blame on me,  
I gave her what she wanted  
And I got misery  
Now I don't take much persuading,  
At times I'm easily led,  
I'm gonna find myself in a prison cell  
Thro' the lying things she said  
  
I'll stand accused on judgment day,  
And pray the lord hears what I say  
All my life I never learned,  
I played with fire and I got burned  
  
Woman trouble blues,  
I got woman trouble blues  
Woman trouble blues,  
Mean ol' woman trouble blues

Hey girl, if you want me,  
Come an' get me  
Don't hang around  
Or we could spend the night sleeping alone  
  
If you could change your style, for a while,  
An' look in my direction,  
Tell me do I look the kind of guy  
Who takes advantage of a women like you  
  
Would I lie to you, would I lie to you  
I would do anything that you want me too,  
But, would I lie to you  
Would I lie to you, would I lie to you  
Baby, I would do anything that you want me too,  
But, would I lie to, would I lie to, would I lie to you  
  
Hey girl, if you need  
Some love an' affection,  
I'll whisper all the sweet, sweet nothings  
I know you little girls like to hear  
If you would change your mind  
We could find a night of satin sheet action,  
I promise I won't do anything  
Baby, unless you wanted me to  
  
Would I lie to you, would I lie to you  
I would do anything that you want me too,  
But, would I lie to you  
Would I lie to you, would I lie to you  
I would do anything that you want me too,  
But, would I lie to, would I lie to, should I lie to you  
  
I don't want to sleep alone tonight,  
After all you put me through.  
I've spent the whole night searching  
For a woman just like you.  
Look in my eyes, tell you lies  
Then, baby, it's just because I want you to stay  
  
Would I lie to you, would I lie to you  
I would do anything that you want me too,  
But, would I lie to you.  
Would I lie to you, would I lie to you  
Baby, I would do anything that you want me too,  
But, would I lie to, would I lie to, would I lie to you

Well it's five in the morning  
When will you be home,  
I'm tired of waiting here baby  
All on my own  
All I got for comfort is some cheap red wine  
But, the thought of what you're doing gives me no peace of mind  
  
You 'n' me, it's got to be just you 'n' me,  
Can't you see, baby  
Can't you see what you're doing to me

In the playboy books,  
Ain't got nothing on you  
In the way that you look  
But, an eye for an eye  
A tooth for a tooth

Tell me no lies  
When I ask you the questions,  
Tell the truth

If you feel the rolling thunder  
An' your eyes see lightning strike,  
Don't be afraid, just call on me  
I'll bring you shelter from the night  
  
When the wind is howling  
I'll hold you near,  
An' soothe your troubled mind  
With a little bit of this,  
An' a little bit of that  
I'll make you leave all your worries behind  
  
Don't try to hold on to what you got,  
'Cause I got what you need  
Don't try to hold on, for anyone,

An' you shake down to your bones,

I'm far from home,  
And tired of this place,  
I miss your good, good love  
And your sweet embrace  
Can't sleep at night  
With you on my mind,  
I just want to run to you, baby,  
Leave it all behind  
  
'Cause it seems so long  
Since I heard your song,

Back where I belong  
  
Your precious love,  
That's all I need,  
Angel spread your wings  
And bring it on home to me  
  
Sometimes in my life  
I don't know what to do,  
Tho' I'm weak for myself  
I try to be strong for you.  
You're there when I need you,  
After all these years,  
So I send you this letter, baby,  
Written in tears

Now I know  
I've seen that look  
On your face before  
When you realized  
All the memories  
Walked right out the door..  
  
Now it's eye for an eye  
A tooth for a tooth  
No more hiding behind the truth  
I'm gonna get exactly  
What's coming to me  
  
You're gonna break my heart again,  
You never let me forget it  
You're gonna break my heart again  
But, you're gonna live to regret it  
  
Now you say  
I took advantage of you  
When you never knew the score  
But, you should know  
We've been this way  
One thousand times before  
  
You told me once,  
You told me twice  
It's down to me, girl  
To pay the price  
But, this time's the last time  
That's for sure.  
  
You're gonna break my heart again,  
You never let me forget it  
You're gonna break my heart again  
But, you're gonna live to regret it  
Yes you are  
  
You talk of how our love  
Was meant to be  
And all the time  
You sacrificed for me.  
  
So how could I forget it,  
Why should I regret it  
'Cause when you told me you loved me  
I knew it was lies  
So no more crying, no more goodbyes,  
'Cause this time's the last time  
That's for sure break my heart.  
  
Now you say  
There is no one in the world  
Can get the better of you  
An' you should know  
'Cause you never made it easy  
With the pain you put me through  
  
I told you once  
I told you twice  
It's down to you, girl  
To pay the price  
'Cause this time's the last time  
That's for sure.  
  
You're gonna break my heart again,  
You never let me forget it  
You're gonna break my heart again  
But, you're gonna live to regret it  
  
I just can't take anymore,  
No more, no more, no more

I want you so bad,  
The thought is driving me mad  
Like a cat on the prowl,  
You come when you want  
And not when I call  
  
So sly, so pretty,  
I want to steal all the keys to your city  
Tight skirt, skinny leg,  
You make a bad dog sit up and beg  
  
You're everything I want,  
Everything I need  
Come in out of the cold, pretty woman,  
Spend the night with me  
  
Oh, you're so fine  
Oh, I want to make your mine all mine,  
'Til the end of time,  
Baby, you're so fine  
  
You're so hot with body heat,  
You cause a fire walking down the street  
You got class, you got style,  
The girls don't like it,  
But, the boys go wild  
  
You're everything I want,  
Everything I need  
Come in out of the cold, pretty woman,  
Spend the night with me  
  
Oh, you're so fine  
Oh, I want to make your mine  
  
Dance little sister,  
Spinning on a dime,  
Shake a shimmy little twister  
  
I'm gonna make you,  
I'm gonna make you mine,  
Mine all mine,  
You're so fine  
  
I want you so bad,  
Just the thought is driving me mad,  
I want to know what you'll do,  
Baby, baby, I can't wait  
To get my hands on you  
  
You're everything I want,  
Everything I need  
Come in out of the cold, pretty woman,  
Spend the night with me  
  
Oh, you're so fine  
Oh, I want to make your mine  
Oh, you're so fine  
Oh, I want to make your mine all mine  
You're so fine, you're so fine  
You're so fine, you're so fine  
You're so fine
