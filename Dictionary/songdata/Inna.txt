[Hook:] x2  
In my life everything is alright  
Everything is alright  
Everything is alright, yeah  
  
When I'm really high  
Don't know why  
In my dreams, in my life  
Time is passing little bit fast.  
When life goes bad, I don't know  
Where to hide, where to go  
I don't really care about the past.  
  
And I say!  
  
[Bridge:] x2  
Oh, I fall in love  
With your body fall in love  
Oh, I say I fall in love  
I love you and I mean it.

In my life everything is alright  
Everything is alright  
Everything is alright, yeah  
  
[Bridge:] x2  
  
[Hook:] x4  
In my life everything is alright  
Everything is alright  
Everything is alright, yeah

[Verse:]  
It's a shame how winter came too soon  
Tried to love you but the love falls too  
Should we let it go, let it go, let it go?  
  
[Chorus:]  
I've been thinking 'bout you  
You've been thinking 'bout me  
All the things that we've done  
Oh how I miss your body and the sun  
I've been thinking 'bout you  
You've been thinking 'bout me  
We were nothing but fun  
Oh how I miss your body and the sun

The one desire  
Believe when I say  
I want it that way  
  
When we are two worlds apart  
Can't reach to your heart

Come on boy, come and get in the rhythm, music will take you high  
What I'm feeling about you, I love you, don't know why  
Everybody come on and get in the rhythm, music will take you high, ooh  
  
All the people tonight, put your hands in the sky  
Come on boy, come and get in the rhythm, music will take you high  
What I'm feeling about you, I love you, don't know why  
Everybody come on and get in the rhythm, music will take you high, ooh

[Hook:]  
Tell me the truth  
Tell me you wanna be bad  
Cause I wanna be bad all the time  
Tell me truth  
When you put your hands on my body  
Tell me you want me tonight  
  
[Verse:]  
I'm looking for my Mr. Wrong  
If that's alright then let me know  
I know exactly what you want  
But if you tell me we can go  
So put your summer hands all over my summer body  
You'll get some of this after my summer party  
I can make it hard if that's the way you want it  
If that's the way you want it  
  
[Hook:]  
Tell me the truth  
Tell me you wanna be bad  
Cause I wanna be bad all the time  
Tell me truth  
When you put your hands on my body  
Tell me you want me tonight
