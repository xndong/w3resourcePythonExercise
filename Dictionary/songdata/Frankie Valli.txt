Put your loving hand out, baby  
I'm begging  
  
(Begging) begging  
Put your loving hand out, baby  
(Begging) begging you  
Put your loving hand out, baby  
  
Riding high when I was king  
Played it hard and fast  
Cause I had everything  
You walked away, won me then  
But easy come and easy go  
And it would end  
  
(Begging) I'm begging you  
Won't you give your hand out, baby  
(Begging) begging  
Put your loving hand out, baby  
  
I need you to understand  
That I tried so hard  
To be your man  
The kind of man you want in the end  
Only then can I begin to live again  
  
An empty shell  
Used to be  
Shadow of my life  
Is hanging over me  
  
Broken man without a throne  
Wont even stand the devils dance  
To win my soul  
  
(Begging) begging you  
  
Won't you give your hand out, baby  
(Begging) begging you  
Put your loving hand out, baby  
  
I'm fighting hard  
To hold my own  
No, I just can't make it  
All alone  
  
I'm holdin on  
I can't fall back  
Now that big brass ring  
Is a shade of black  
  
(Begging) I'm begging you  
Won't you give your hand out, baby  
(Begging) begging  
Put your loving hand out, baby  
  
(Begging) begging you

Big man in town...  
  
Each day as I grow older,  
The nights are getting colder.  
Some day the sun will shine on me.  
Money, I don't have any:  
I'm down to my last penny,  
But, darling, don't cry over me:  
  
I'll be a big man in town (honest, honey)  
I'll be a big man in town (promise, darling)  
I'll be a big man in town, just you wait and see:  
You'll be proud of me.  
  
They think that I'm a rover,  
But my roving days are over.  
Someday your folks will welcome me.  
I went away a small man,  
But I'll come home a tall man.  
Then what a pretty bride you'll be.  
  
I'll be a big man in town (honest, honey)  
I'll be a big man in town (promise, darling)

I'm gonna make it, just wait and see.  
Just wait and see,  
Girl, I'm gonna make it, just wait and see.

If you hate me after what I say  
Can't put it off any longer  
I just gotta tell you anyway  
Bye bye baby, baby good-bye  
(Bye baby, baby bye bye)  
Bye bye baby, baby don't make me cry  
(Bye baby, baby bye bye)  
You're the one girl in town I'd marry  
Girl I'd marry you now if I were free  
I wish it could be  
I could love you but why begin it  
Cause there ain't any future in it  
(She's got me and I'm not free so)  
Bye bye baby, baby good-bye  
(Bye baby, baby bye bye)  
Bye bye baby don't make me cry  
(Bye baby, baby bye bye)  
Guess I never will know you better  
Wish I knew you before I met her  
Gee, how good you would be for me  
Should have told you that I can't linger  
There's a wedding ring on my finger  
(She's got me and I'm not free so)  
Bye bye baby, baby good-bye  
(Bye baby, baby bye bye)  
Bye bye baby don't make me cry  
(Bye baby, baby bye bye)  
Ohhhhh, ohhhhhh  
Bye, baby bye

At long last love has arrived  
And I thank God I'm alive  
You're just too good to be true  
Can't take my eyes off you  
  
Pardon the way that I stare  
There's nothing else to compare

Please let me know that is real  
You're just too good to be true

Whoa, ho, ho, here I am on my knees again  
I'll do anything just to make it right  
Say you'll understand, oh I know you can  
C'mon Marianne  
  
No matter what people say, it didn't happen that way  
She was a passing fling and not a permanent thing  
Say you'll understand, oh, I know you can

You're home again, I'm glad you kept the key  
Been waiting here, it seemed a million years to me  
But hush now I know you're all cried out  
It's all right inside, I've had no doubt  
About your love for me  
I can see behind the tears  
I'm certain of the way we feel  
And given time the hurt will heal  
  
I need you, I think I always will  
From time to time you play around  
But I love you still  
You tried them all, at everybody's beck and call  
Maybe you resist them all  
When I tell you how I missed you  
  
Fallen angel, I'll forgive you anything  
You can't help the things you do  
  
Home again so won't you close the door  
Stay here with me and  
We'll forget what's gone before  
Just hold me tight  
Our love is gonna make it right  
Put shadows way beyond recall  
The ghost has almost gone  
  
Fallen angel, I'll forgive you anything  
You can't help the things you do

Girl come running  
Girl come running  
Girl come running home  
  
When you get tired of running around  
(Runnin' around, all over town)  
All of your friends putting you down  
(Puttin' you down, all over town)  
Don't do your crying alone  
(All alone)  
Well baby girl come running home  
  
Some day you'll be feelin' so low  
(Lower than low, nowhere to go)  
Why don't you call on me girl, that's when I'll show  
(I love you so, I love you so)  
Don't do your crying alone  
(All alone)  
Hey baby  
Girl come running home

And don't you forget that I'm feelin it too  
(Bluer than blue, baby it's true)

I solve my problems and I see the light  
We got a lovin' thing, we gotta feed it right  
There ain't no danger we can go to far  
We start believing now that we can be what we are  
  
Grease is the word  
  
They think our love is just a growing pain  
Why don't they understand, It's just a crying shame  
Their lips are lying only real is real  
We stop the fight right now, we got to be what feel  
Grease is the word  
It's got groove it's got meaning  
Grease is the time, is the place, is the motion  
Grease is the way we are feeling  
  
We take the pressure and we throw away  
Conventionality belongs to yesterday  
There is a chance that we can make it so far  
We start believing now but we can be who we are  
  
Grease is the word  
It's got groove it's got meaning  
Grease is the time, is the place is the motion  
Grease is the way we are feeling  
  
This is the life of illusion  
Wrapped up in trouble, laced with confusion  
What are we doing here?  
  
We take the pressure and we throw away  
Conventionality belongs to yesterday  
There is a chance that we can make it so far  
We start believing now that we can be who we are  
  
Grease is the word  
It's got groove it's got meaning  
Grease is the time, is the place is the motion  
Grease is the way we are feeling  
  
Grease is the word  
It's got groove it's got meaning  
Grease is the time, is the place is the motion  
Grease is the way we are feeling  
  
Grease is the word  
Is the word  
Is the word

Someday baby, we'll leave this town  
For a little house and counrty scene  
But right now my love  
It's gonna take some time  
Saving our nickels  
Counting all our dimes  
Then hickory glows, 'cause hickory knows  
With each song she sings him  
A new day she brings him  
He says hickory when your singing the blues  
This downtown guy feels like uptown new  
Something in your voice sounded soothing and clear  
Like magic, this old ghetto seems to disappear  
There across town, in a brown stone cellar  
There's a bit of heaven singin'  
Every night a song keeps bringin'  
Crowds of people by the score  
Hickory's heart must be made of sunshine  
Singing songs of sweet salvation  
Brings back inspiration  
Keeps them coming back for more  
They sing hickory, when your singing the blues  
This downtown street feels like uptown new  
Something in your voice sounded soothing and clear  
Like magic this old ghetto seems to disappear  
Hickory got a guy she lives for  
He drives taxi downtown city  
That job of his is dirt and gritty  
'Nough to make a big man cry  
Countin' his coin till makes a dollar  
To pay the rent for where they're sleepin'  
She's always at the door to greet him  
Sayin' they'll make it by and by  
Hickory when your singin' the blues  
This downtown guy feels like uptown new  
Something in your voice sounded soothing and clear  
Like magic this old ghetto seems to disappear  
Hickory, hickory, hickorrryyyyy  
Hickory, hickory...

When I'm away from you  
I know what to say and do  
But every time you're near  
My courage disappears ah-ha  
The words are on my lips  
When my composure slips  
While you're collected and cool  
I make a fool of myself  
  
I want so much to be  
The only love you see  
I fall each time I try  
To look good in your eyes ah-ha  
Don't know if I'll get through  
Being destroyed by you  
While you're collected and cool  
I make a fool of myself  
  
Hey little girl  
How could you care  
Little girl, you're unaware  
Of the love I have to share  
Inside me dying  
Oh I'm crying  
  
Lord above please let me see  
She's the life and breath of me  
How my heart is breakin'  
When I'm sleepin', wakin'  
I keep making a fool of myself  
  
I want so much to be  
The only love you see  
I fall each time I try  
To look good in your eyes ah-ha  
Don't know if I'll get through  
Being destroyed by you  
While you're collected and cool  
I make a fool of myself  
Oh little girl  
How could you care  
Little girl, you're unaware  
Of the love I have to share  
Inside me dying  
Oh I'm crying

I've blessed the day I found you  
I want to stay around you  
And so I beg you  
Let it be me  
  
Don't take this heaven from one  
If you must cling to someone  
Now and forever  
Let it be me  
  
Each time we meet love  
I find complete love  
Without your sweet love  
What would life be  
  
So never leave me lonely  
Tell me you love me only  
And that you'll always  
Let it be me  
  
Each time we meet love

Going to Terry Town  
Everybody knows me there  
I've been away too long  
In a concrete world  
Where no one cares  
  
So you say that  
You gotta be lonely  
It's a sign that  
Can never change  
  
I'll paint a patch of blue  
On the weather beaten  
Skies for you  
I'll make the sun come  
Through for you, girl  
You know I will  
(You know I will)  
  
If you believe in love  
Take my hand and come along  
Lonlieness never ends when you're  
Living where you can't belong  
  
Set your mind for  
A chance to be happy  
Let your heart find  
A way to love  
  
I'll paint a patch of blue  
On the weather beaten  
Skies for you  
I'll make the sun come  
Through for you, girl

(Rag doll, ooh) (Hand me down)  
When she was just a kid  
Her clothes were hand-me-downs  
  
(Hand-me-down)  
They always laughed at her when she came into town  
Called her rag doll  
Little rag doll  
  
Such a pretty face should be dressed in lace  
Ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh

There is a rose in Spanish Harlem  
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem  
It is a special one, it's never seen the sun  
It only comes out when the moon is on the run  
And all the stars are gleamin'  
  
It's growing in the street right up through the concrete  
But soft and sweet and dreamin'  
  
There is a rose in Spanish Harlem  
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem  
With eyes as black as coal that look down in my soul  
And starts a fire there and then I lose control  
I have to beg your pardon  
  
I'm going to pick that rose  
And watch her as she grows in my garden  
  
I'm gonna pick that rose

I see the summer roses  
Your favorite shade of roses  
And that reminds me too of you dear

Burning down deep inside.  
Got a heart break that I can't hide.  
  
I'm not the proud one.  
I need you.  
I'm beggin' to you baby please.  
You're the proud one.  
Believe me.  
This big man is down on his knees.  
Baby please.  
  
Oh baby (baby), remember (baby), when you were warm and tender.  
Beggin' me surrender to your charm.  
You gave me your sweet lips.  
Said use them.  
Oh, why did I abuse them.  
Didn't know good from bad.  
Girl I didn't know what I had.  
  
I'm not the proud one.  
I need you.  
I'm beggin' to you baby please.  
You're the proud one.  
Believe me.  
This big man is down on his knees.  
Baby please.  
  
Oh baby I love you.  
Please come back.  
I need you.  
I need you.  
  
I'm not the proud one.  
I need you.  
I'm beggin' to you baby please.

Loneliness is the coat you wear  
A deep shade of blue is always there  
  
The sun ain't gonna shine anymore  
The moon ain't gonna rise in the sky  
Tears are always clouding your eyes  
When you're without love  
Baby  
  
Emptiness is the place you're in  
Nothing to lose, but no more to win  
  
The sun ain't gonna shine anymore  
The moon ain't gonna rise in the sky  
Tears are always clouding your eyes  
When you're without love  
Lonely  
Without you  
Baby  
Oh, I need you  
I can't go on  
  
The sun ain't gonna shine anymore  
The moon ain't gonna rise in the sky  
Tears are always clouding your eyes  
The sun ain't gonna shine anymore  
When you're without love  
  
The sun ain't gonna shine anymore  
The sun ain't gonna shine anymore  
Not anymore  
The sun ain't gonna shine anymore  
Bring it back, baby  
The sun ain't gonna shine anymore  
Oh, baby

Kiss me each morning for a million years  
Hold me each evening by your side  
And tell me you'll love me for a million years  
If it don't work out, if it don't work out  
Then you can tell me goodbye  
  
Sweeten my coffee with a mornin' kiss  
Soften my dreams with a sigh  
After you'd loved me for a million years  
If it don't work out, if it don't work out  
Then you can tell me goodbye  
  
If you must go, no, I won't grieve  
If you wait a lifetime before you leave  
  
But if you must go, I won't tell you no  
Just so we can say that we tried  
Tell me you'll love me for a million years  
If it don't work out, if it don't work out  
Then you can tell me goodbye  
  
But if you must go, I won't tell you no  
Just so we can say that we tried  
Tell me you'll love me for a million years  
Then if it don't work out, and if it don't work out  
Then you can tell me goodbye  
Then you can tell me goodbye

You see this guy, this guy's in love with you  
Yes, I'm in love, who looks at you the way I do  
When you smile I can tell we know each other very well  
  
How can I show you I'm glad, I've got to know you 'cause  
I've heard some talk, they say you think I'm fine  
This guy's in love and what I'd do to make you mine  
Tell me now, is it so? Don't let me be the last to know  
  
My hands are shakin', don't let my heart keep breaking 'cause  
I need your love, I want your love  
Say, you're in love, in love with this guy, if not I'll just die  
  
Tell me now, is it so? Don't let me be the last to know  
My hands are shakin', don't let my heart keep breaking 'cause  
I need your love, I want your love  
Say, you're in love, in love with this guy, if not I'll just die

To give is the reason I live  
To give all I can give  
In return, for the life that I earn  
  
I was born as a part of the plan  
With the heart of a man  
With a will to survive  
  
And I believe  
Everything on this earth  
Having meaning and worth  
Made of concrete and air  
Is to share and to feel  
Justify I exist  
To describe on the list  
Of someone  
With a place in the sun  
  
Here I stand, reaching out for the sky  
Till the day that I die  
I must give all I can  
When I go  
I'll go out empty hand  
Leaving dust to the land  
Just the soul I have found  
Leaves the ground

(Watch the flowers grow, watch 'em grow)  
Did you ever see a flower grow?  
If you did then you would surely know  
Love is like the flowers,  
Takes a lot of hours  
If you really want to know,  
Watch the flowers grow.  
  
Listen to my thoughts and take a ride,  
I shall give you all you've been denied  
First you gotta slow down,  
Listen to my sweet sound  
If you really want to know,  
Watch the flowers grow.  
  
Over the mountain there's a sweet meadow  
A breeze is blowin', so take my hand and we can  
Watch the flowers grow  
  
Let me take you where the flowers grow  
Let me be the one who told you so  
I'll love you forever,  
I will leave you never  
Baby let's go,  
Watch the flowers grow.  
  
(Watch the flowers grow, watch 'em grow)  
(Watch the flowers grow, watch 'em grow)

Outside the rain begins  
And it may never end  
So cry no more  
On the shore, a dream  
Will take us out to sea  
Forever more, forever more  
  
Close your eyes, Aimie  
And you can be with me  
'Neath the waves, through the caves of hours  
Long forgotten now  
We're all alone, we're all alone  
  
Close the window, calm the light  
And it will be all right  
No need to bother now  
Let it out, let it all begin  
Learn how to pretend  
  
Once a story's told  
It can't help but grow old  
Roses do, lovers too so cast  
Your seasons to the wind  
And hold me, dear  
Oh, hold me, dear  
  
Close the window, calm the light  
And it will be all right  
No need to bother now  
Let it out, let it all begin  
All's forgotten now  
We're all alone, all alone  
  
Close the window, calm the light  
And it will be all right  
No need to bother now  
Let it out, let it all begin  
All forgotten now  
My love  
  
My, my love  
My love

As I walk this land of broken dreams  
I have visions of many things  
But happiness is just an illusion  
Filled with sadness and confusion  
  
What becomes of the broken hearted  
Who had love that's now departed?  
I know I've got to find  
Some kind of piece of mind, maybe  
  
If roots of love grow all around  
But for me they come tumblin' down  
Every day heartaches grow a little stronger  
I can't stand this pain much longer  
  
I walk in shadows searching for light  
Cold and alone, no comfort in sight  
Hopin' and prayin' for someone to care  
Always movin' and goin' nowhere  
  
What becomes of the broken hearted  
Who had love that's now departed?  
I know I've got to find  
Some kind of piece of mind  
[Incomprehensible] help me please  
  
I'm searchin' though I don't succeed  
But someones love there's a growin' need  
All is lost there's no place for beginning  
All that's left is an unhappy ending  
  
What becomes of the broken hearted  
Who had love that's now departed?  
I know I've got to find  
Some kind of piece of mind  
I'll be searchin' everywhere  
Just to find someone to care  
  
What becomes of the broken hearted  
Who had love that's now departed?  
I'll be searchin' everywhere  
Just to find someone to care  
Help, oh, help me please  
  
What becomes of the broken hearted  
Who had love that's now departed?  
I'll be searchin' everywhere  
Just to find someone to care

With Chris Forde  
  
Seeing you again  
Tryin' to pretend  
That I've been fine  
Smilin' all the while  
Hoping you can see behind my smile  
  
Hearing how you laugh  
Knowing what I have and what I've lost  
Trying not to touch  
Trying not to let it show too much  
  
Where did we go wrong  
Were we so right together  
Were the best thing ever  
Never two so strong  
  
Where did we go wrong?  
  
Asking for your friends  
Trying to pretend  
There is someone new  
Wondering of you cared  
Go ahead to face my lonely room  
  
Where did we go wrong  
Weren't we so right together  
Weren't in love forever  
Has it been so long  
Where did we go wrong  
  
Where did we go wrong  
Didn't we belong together  
Weren't we the best thing ever  
Never two so strong  
Where did we go wrong  
  
Where did we go wrong  
Weren't we so right together  
Weren't we in love forever  
Has it been so long  
Where did we go wrong  
  
Where did we go wrong  
Weren't we so right together  
Weren't we in love forever  
Has it been so long  
Where did we go wrong

Working my way back to you, babe  
With a burnin' love inside  
Yeah, I'm workin' my way back to you, babe  
And the happiness that died  
I let it get away  
Been payin' every day  
  
When you were so in love with me  
I played around like I was free  
Thought I could have my cake and eat it too  
But how I cried over losin' you  
See me cryin' now, but I ain't about to go  
Livin' my life without you  
For every day I made you cry  
I'm payin', girl, 'til the day that I die  
  
I used to love to make you cry  
It made me feel like a man inside  
But if I'd been a man in reality  
You'd still be here, babe, lovin' me  
Now the nights are long and lonely  
And I ain't through strugglin', I just miss you so  
And you're too proud you won't give in  
But when I think about all I can win  
  
Working my way back to you, babe  
With a burnin' love inside  
Yeah, I'm workin' my way back to you, babe  
And the happiness that died, oh how I cried

I love you just you, it's true (baby, it's true)  
But how much more do you need to be satisfied  
Than I can give the way you live (baby, can give)  
You cheat all over, a rover you are  
Makes me tell you oh  
  
[Chorus]  
You know you're gonna hurt yourself (hey)  
You know you're gonna hurt yourself  
When you're broke and worn out  
When your heart is torn out  
  
1, 2 Don't 3, oh call me  
1, 2 Don't call me  
I love you to coda  
  
It can't wait 'til it's too late (baby, it's true)  
If you want my love, take my love, but don't go shoppin'  
'Round the town 'til you have found (baby, can give)  
The guy you needed was me all along  
Baby, baby, oh  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Instrumental break (as per last three lines of verse]  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Girl, yeah know you're gonna hurt yourself, hey)  
Girl, don't hurt yourself  
(Girl, yeah know you're gonna hurt yourself, hey)  
Come on now, girl

You know you're gonna hurt yourself  
(Girl, yeah know you're gonna hurt yourself, hey)  
Come on girl

(You're ready now)  
(You're ready now)  
(You're ready now)  
(You're ready now)  
  
When I met you, you were too young,  
To hang around where the hippies hung,  
To swing and dance where the swingers swung,  
  
Well you're ready now, mmmm you're ready now,  
You're ready now, girl, you're ready now.  
  
You grew up fast like over-night,  
You sure have changed, girl, you're out of sight,  
You wanna swing and dance all night,  
  
You're ready now, you're ready now,  
You're ready now, oh, you're ready now.  
  
You pick up quick, I knew you would,  
You move and groove just the way you should,  
You've got that feel of running good,  
  
Well you're ready now, oh, you're ready now,  
You're ready now, girl, you're ready now.  
  
Come on near me, (come on baby)  
Come on near me, (come on baby)  
Do you hear me? (yes i hear you)  
Oh baby can you hear me? (yes i hear you)  
  
You've got it girl, you've got that talk,  
You've got that wiggle in the way you walk,  
You've got, i see, what gets to me,  
  
Well you're ready now, mmmm you're ready now,  
You're ready now, girl, you're ready now.  
(You're ready now, you're ready now)  
(You're ready now, you're ready now)

Yeah, yeah yeah
