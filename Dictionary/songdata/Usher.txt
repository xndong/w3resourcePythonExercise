She built a bridge out of her own insecurities  
No one was brave enough to cross except for me  
Here I am  
She built a castle from the pieces she took from me  
I'm going crazy, I think she brought all the worst in me  
Here I am (Yeah)  
  
Guess the price was the fall if I get up  
Cause the strong will survive, that don't give up  
Where she fell in love, her heart is resting down  
Six feet underground  
  
Oooh she feel stupid loving me for me (Yeah)  
And I'm the fool who falls to easily  
We all fall down sometimes  
We all fall down sometimes  
So why can't I (hey)?  
So why can't I (hey)?  
  
You gotta go I know the time waits for no man  
Don't say your words unspoken girl I overstand  
Here I am  
Why do we meet? Some questions don't have an answer  
Two out of three made me a believer  
Here I am  
  
Guess the price was the fall if I get up  
Cause the strong will survive, that don't give up  
Where she fell in love her heart is resting down  
Six feet underground  
  
Oooh she feel stupid loving me for me (Yeah)  
And I'm the fool who falls to easily  
We all fall down sometimes  
Girl we all fall down sometimes  
So why can't I (hey)?  
So why can't I (hey)?

Usher Usher, yeah man, true story,  
Real G's wit me on this one, ya, ya, ya, ya  
  
[Verse 1]  
Wifey home, wedding band I'm a lucky man,  
You'd think I'd be satisfied and truthfully yes I am,  
But lately, only late at night I find it hard to sleep,  
Stay struggling with the part of me that wants to run the streets,  
My Mac is in my backpack, I'm surfing on the sites,  
I'm chatting, this ain't cheating, just telling myself a lie,  
And it's almost like I'm caught up and living another life,  
Man I'm hungry for something, I need to feed this appetite  
  
[Chorus]  
Tempted I must confess, but I better not make a mess,  
Better give my girl my best put my b.s. under arrest,  
Cause I love my lady,  
Fellas if ya love your girl fight that appetite for the ladies, appetite for
the ladies,  
Could'a picked up the phone, could of ended up doing wrong,  
Man I miss home, but I ate my dinner at home, cause I love my lady,  
Fellas if ya love your girl fight that appetite for the ladies, appetite for
the ladies,  
  
[Verse 2]  
I'm not trying to be late, rush through security gates,  
With weather in Atlanta, all out going flights delayed,  
No rooms left in the Mandarin, I gotta figure out a play,  
Sparked up some conversation, she was going the same way,  
We started talking business, she handed me a card,  
We exchanged information, I rented me a car,  
While I'm driving she calling, I'm thinking this is how it starts,  
Fine as hell but I don't wanna break my baby?s heart, no no no.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 3]  
They call me U.S.H.E.R R.A.Y.M.O.N.D,  
And I just wanna do right by my lady,  
But lately I been slippin' up, fantasies bout dimes on the side,  
Dark tint on my ride, I gotta 10 in ride, I can hide,  
I can't lie lie, but ever since I put that band on my hand,  
More and more chicks trying to get at me,  
Then I don't know what to do,  
Just trying to handle my grown man B.I,  
Got a girl I don't want to lose, I don't want to lose,  
Break her heart, I do want to do, I don't want to be that fool,  
Make that move,  
Bend them a bit, but never break the rules, bend a bit but never break the
rules  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Bridge]  
She got the door locked, and the lock don't fit, your key,  
Yeah you punching up her numbers in the ADT,  
You'll be wondering how the hell I let this happen to me,  
Better not feed feed feed that appetite,  
Now your baby's gone, you putting out an APB  
And some other brother, been tossing up your PYT  
Get caught slippin' you gone wish you would of listened to me,  
Brother don't feed feed feed that appetite.  
  
Usher Usher Ussshh

Woah woah wooah yeeah yeeah  
Saw you for you yeah  
  
[Repeats in Background]  
Remember  
  
You changed my life in so many ways  
I just think back to, how I used to be  
And how you dealt with me  
Just want to thank you  
  
Just in case I never see your face again (face again)  
Just in case the worst was meant to happen (happen)  
Just in case tomorrow never come there is something you should know (should
know)  
I've given you every bit of the man I am (of the man I am)  
I know at times it wasn't pretty but it was all I had  
I never held back not one lil' bit and the world can attest to this  
And baby you flipped my program upside down (listen to me now)  
  
[Chorus]  
I was a hustler and player girl before I met you  
I'd drink a lil' something then hit a lil' something  
But how you made a difference, look what I've been missing  
You got my life together and I thank you forever  
I really used to throw a lot  
But I do one every night and sometimes I had two  
But all that done changed my game my frame of mind you got it right  
And I love you life girl I love you for life  
  
There was so many times I wasn't there for you  
And for everyone of those times I hated myself for  
The way I went about it the ups and the downs one foot in while the other
foots out  
Loving on you loving on another and I ain't no different from any of the
brothers  
What I did to you right here right now in this here place  
In this here space as my heart pour out as I state my case as I break it down  
To tell you where I'm coming from so you've seen the good you've done  
So you've feel the change you've made stay with me everyday  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Girl if I died tonight before I wake  
Know that you touched my life in oh so many ways  
And sugar this song is this I had to give would you remember  
Remember my heart remember it was good remember that I tried as long as I
could  
Remember that I gave till I had nothing else remember my voice  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Repeats in Background]  
Remember  
  
Woah woah woah  
Yeah yeah yeah woah  
Won't you remember?

[Verse 1: Usher]  
She hit me with that killer  
She make me sling that skrilla  
Body tight for the summer  
Get it, get it for the winter  
Real player niggas  
Need something they can lay on  
That shit on my mind  
I need something to spend my day on  
And I love her like my niggas, my niggas, my niggas  
She ain't 'bout my feelings, my feelings, my feelings  
And I can't live by these hoes  
Cause she the one I chose  
Got the keys to the Benz  
I don't even drive my shit no more  
And let us just  
  
[Bridge: Usher]  
Bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump

And I don't know how it started (and I don't know how)  
But I'm ready to go, I'm ready to

[Verse 2: Usher]  
I know you feel me getting ready  
Cause you're all that's on my mind  
Tonight's champagne and confetti  
If you want, I'll stand in line  
For a little loving  
For a little bumping  
I hope that you hear what I'm sayin'  
I'm hopin' and prayin', I'll say it again  
  
[Chorus: Usher]  
I don't know where we going  
And I don't know what to call this  
And I don't know how it started  
But I'm ready to go, I'm ready to  
I don't know where it's going (I don't know where it's going)  
And I don't know what to call this (I don't know what to call this)  
And I don't know how it started (and I don't know how)  
But I'm ready to go, I'm ready to (ready to)

Usher speaking  
Yo!  
What's sup?  
Hey!  
My name is Usher,  
You can trust there ain't  
No punks in this house,  
And if you really wanna know what my name is  
Just Call Me A Mack  
Word,  
Right!  
Just call me the mack  
Anytime baby,  
Cause I ain't confused  
Usher singing  
I maybe got some,  
But I got a  
Whole lot on manly in me  
So I'm afraid  
That I can't complain (Huh, ha!)  
I don't mind  
If you wanna come by my crib  
And chill,  
But just be sure  
That you call me first  
Because the last girl that tried  
To just be droppin' on by (Oh, no)  
Learned how to play a player  
And do you know why,  
Because the mack  
Hook  
Just Call Me A Mack  
Cause I got it like that  
You gotta play by the rules  
Or I'll get back with you  
It's a well known fact  
That I got it like that  
You gotta play by the rules  
Just Call Me A Mack  
Now, baby I ain't dumb  
And all those silly  
Games that you play  
I see right through  
So let me kick it to yah (To yah!)  
I don't have a lot of girls,  
But I gotta know  
I'll get the respect that I give  
That's just the way I live  
Because the last girl  
I had was moving  
Things too fast (Slow down)  
She tried to pull a fooler  
And do you know  
What had happened  
Hook (twice)  
Usher's Rap  
The mack is right here  
And yes I care as much  
Just giving a little love  
It's spreading everywhere  
You see it's  
Here  
Here  
And here  
Catch a feeling  
I'm having a little trouble  
I know my girl will always  
Hit it  
Pit it  
Like an orange  
Cause it looks  
Like numbness  
My lovin' and  
Hugin'  
And bitterness  
My peeps keep  
Pumpin'  
Humpin'  
On stage  
I'm engaged  
And yes  
The truth is it  
You see an  
Ugly woman  
You better change  
Usher singing  
Oh, yes  
Like Ushers' my name  
I can't go changing  
My ways (Oh, no)  
As long as I'm chillin'  
Then baby  
You can call me the mack  
Hook (3 times)  

Yo, shit  
I'm sick of this man  
I can't even take no more  
'Cause I hate the fact that I love you so much  
  
And you know what I'm sayin'  
You don't even understand what this is doin' to me  
Everytime I try to get away  
  
I just can't let you go, you know what I'm sayin'  
I just can't let you go  
I never ever want to hurt you  
I just wanna to love ya  
I just wanna to sex ya up  
  
Want to give you everything you need  
Things you want, just lay down  
Let me love ya all night long  
I don't wanna to leave ya, I just wanna to keep ya  
  
When they saw me, they saw you  
Damn the world, it's just me and my girl  
That's how I felt, every time I thought it was right  
It went left  
  
We used to love and party  
Now all we do is argue  
I tell myself I don't want you no more  
But I can't let you go  
  
So much love and hurt  
And hate, people screaming it won't work  
Time and time I say I'm gonna leave  
But I can't let you go  
  
(This ain't funny man, you know what man  
You ain't even got to wait till in the mornin' man  
You can get out of here at night man  
Ah-yo clear, go rap, go shit, get out of here )  
  
Baby you not gonna like me  
But you not gonna fight me  
You can walk away and say  
I never gave you everything you want, thing you need  
  
All we ever do is argue all night long  
I don't want to leave you, see you  
With another brother lovin ya sayin'  
Damn the world, it's just me and my girl  
  
That's how I feel  
When you think everything is real  
But it really ain't  
We used to love and party  
  
Now all we do is argue  
I tell myself I don't want you no more  
But I can't let you go  
So much love and hurt  
  
And hate, people screaming it won't work  
Time to time I say I'm gonna leave  
But I can't let you go  
We used to love and party

But I can't let you go  
  
[JD]  
Got me walkin' around ready to snap  
Got me walkin' around lookin for somebody to slap  
Got me goin', goin', with no pause (?)  
Got me up in Cartier every day just cause  
Got me arguin' about little stuff  
  
She don't call lil' stuff  
When it get a little rough,  
We me kiss and make up  
She want to say what she want to, I don't play that  
She want to constantly bring up shit from way back  
  
Got me thinkin' about her while I'm watchin' a flick  
Got me dippin through traffic tryin' to get home quick  
Got me talkin' to myself "I'm hatin' this"  
Got me wantin' to wild out like I'm Jadakiss  
Got me in a place I never thought I would see  
Got me not wantin' to stay, and not wantin' to leave  
Got me happy  
Got me confused  
Got me wishin' I could get it how I used to  
  
We used to love and party  
Now all we do is argue  
I tell myself I don't want you no more  
But I can't let you go  
  
So much love and hurt  
And hate, people screaming it won't work  
Time to time I say I'm gonna leave  
But I can't let you go

Who been doin' it my way  
Gettin' my bread for years  
In my career  
And every lover  
In and out my life  
I hear love and left the tears  
Without a care  
Until I met this girl who turned the tables around  
She caught me by surprise  
I never thought I'd be the one breaking down  
I can't figure it out why  
  
I'm so, caught up  
Got me feelin' it, caught up  
I don't know what it is  
But it seems she's got me twisted  
I'm so, caught up  
Got me feelin' it, caught up  
I'm losin' control, this girls got a hold on me  
  
Let me go baby  
Now listen  
My momma told me  
Be careful who you do 'cause karma comes back around  
Same ol' song  
But I was so sure  
That it wouldn't happen to me  
'cause I know how to put it down  
But I was so wrong  
This girl was mean  
She really turned me out  
Her body was so tight  
I'm lookin' for her in the daytime with a flashlight  
My homies say this girl is crampin' my style  
And I can't figure it out  
  
But I'm so, caught up  
Got me feelin' it, caught up  
I don't know what it is  
But it seems she's got me twisted  
  
I'm so, caught up  
Got me feelin' it, caught up  
I'm losin' control  
This girls got a hold  
I'm so, caught up  
Really feelin' it, caught up  
I don't know what it is  
But it seems she's got me twisted  
  
I'm so, caught up  
Really feelin' it, caught up  
I'm losin' control  
This girls got a hold on me  
  
And I think I like it baby  
Oh no, oh no, ooh, yeah, oh my  
  
This girl was mean  
She really turned me out  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, suga  
My homies say this girl is crampin' my style  
I'm so, caught up, caught up  
Don't know what it is  
But it seems she's got me twisted  
I'm so, caught up  
Really feelin' it, caught up  
I'm losin' control  
This girls got a hold

But it seems she's got me twisted  
I'm, caught up  
Really feelin' it  
Caught up, I'm losin' control  
This girls got a hold on me

[Chorus]  
Going nowhere fast  
We've reached the climax  
We're together, now we're undone  
Won't commit so we choose to  
Run away  
Do we separate? Oh  
Don't wanna give in so we both gave up  
Can't take it back, it's too late, we've reached the climax  
Climax  
  
I've fallen somehow  
Feet off the ground  
Love is the cloud  
That keeps raining down  
Where are you now?  
When I need you around  
I'm on my knees, but it seems we're  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I gave my best, it wasn't enough  
You get upset, we argue too much  
We made a mess of what used to be love  
So why do I care, I care at all  
At all  
At all  
At all  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You say it's better if we  
Love each other separately  
I just need you one more time  
I can't get what we had out my mind  
Where are you now  
When I need you around  
I'm on my knees  
But it seems we're going  
  
[Chorus]

[Usher talking on phone]  
Hello?  
Yo I'm in the booth I'mma call you right back  
Nah I just gotta put this one part down I'mma call you back  
I'm at the studio man what--  
  
Man quit playin' with me man  
No for real don't play like that  
Are you--are you serious?  
How you know?  
  
Put that on everything.  
Damn  
I'm a call you back  
I'm a call you back...  
  
[Intro]  
Everytime I was in L.A. I was with my ex-girlfriend  
Everytime you called I told you,  
"Baby I'm workin." (No!)  
I was out doin my dirt (Oh!)  
  
Wasn't thinkin' 'bout you gettin' hurt  
(I) was hand in hand in the Beverly Center like man  
Not givin' a damn who sees me  
So gone (I know)  
  
So wrong (Just listen)  
Thinkin' I got it and left you sittin' at home  
Thinkin' about me  
Bein' a good girl that you are  
  
But you prolly believe you got a good man  
I mean I would never do the things I'm a 'bout to tell you I've done  
Brace yourself  
It ain't good  
But it would be even worse if you heard this from somebody else (oh no)  
  
[Usher speaking]  
I know you hate me  
I know I hurt you  
But there's more  
listen...

Would you mind if I still loved you?  
(Would you mind if things don't last?)  
Would you mind if I hold onto  
You so that I won't crash...?  
  
Morning light, I'm at your door  
One last time, and no one's there  
(Nobody, nobody, nobody, no...)  
Drove all night, just to beat you home  
Would you mind if I waited?  
Would you mind if I wait right here?  
  
And I really, really, wanna love you  
And I'm really only yours  
Even if it don't last forever, I wanna let you know  
We really had something special, it's hard tryna let it go  
I'm just being honest, I'm still in the moment  
  
Would you mind if I still loved you?  
Would you mind if things don't last?  
Would you mind if I hold onto  
You so that I won't crash?  
  
Up all night, can't let go  
Won't stop trying, need you to know  
It's worth the fight, if I get back come  
Hope you don't mind I waited  
Would you mind if I wait right here?  
  
And I really, really, wanna love you  
And I'm really only yours  
Even if it don't last forever, I wanna let you know  
We really had something special, it's hard tryna let it go  
I'm just being honest (I'm still in the moment)  
  
Would you mind if I still loved you?  
Would you mind if things don't last?  
Would you mind if I hold onto  
You so that I won't crash?  
  
I'm not thinking 'bout nobody else but you  
You're the only one who takes me there  
I'm not thinking 'bout nobody else but you  
You're the only one who takes me there  
I'm not thinking 'bout nobody else but you  
You're the only one who takes me there  
I'm not thinking 'bout nobody else but you  
You're the only one who takes me there  
  
Would you mind if I still loved you?  
Would you mind if things don't last?  
Would you mind if I hold onto  
  
(You so that I won't crash...?)

[Chorus]  
I'm crazy, so crazy  
I'm crazy about you  
I'm crazy so crazy, about you  
(Crazy 'bout you baby)  
  
What kind of love is this  
That keeps me hypnotized - can't' get you off  
My mind  
Don't ever let it end - let it go on and on and on  
'Cause you know it turns me on  
  
Whisper in my ear, just what I want to hear  
Cause no one can love me like you do  
Ohh that's why I am  
Crazy...  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'd like to take this time  
To tell you how I feel - to let you know the deal  
So baby, let's make plans  
I want you to be my only girl  
Cause you know I'll be your man  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm crazy - about you  
  
[Chorus]

[Verse 1]  
I'm hoping that this ain't too hard to believe  
Cause baby, you're the only one for me  
I know it gets hard when I'm moving in and outta' state  
But I promise my heart for you I would save  
  
Just remember that  
  
[Chorus]  
No matter how far I go  
And no matter how long it takes  
No one or nothing can change  
Forever yours here I stand (Here I stand baby)  
  
[Verse 2]  
You're like a mirror to my soul, but a queen (My queen)  
And finally now I know just what that means (Oh yeah, yeah)  
You're the blessing that I never thought I would get  
And to the Lord I humbly bow my head  
  
Just remember that  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Hook]  
Ever since you came (Since you came along)  
It seems life (couldn't get it right)  
I found I sunk so low, that there was no way I could be found  
(Never thought love would find me)  
And when we make love (every time you give, give to me your love)  
You make feel a way I never felt,  
With no one else, and I can't help myself  
I'm telling you, that  
  
[Chorus]  
No matter how far I go (yeah)  
See no matter how long it takes (yeah)  
No one or nothing, nothing baby, ever change the way I feel, I'm your man,
Listen?  
See, forever yours, yours, all yours, Here I stand (yeah)  
No matter how far I go  
And no matter how long it takes (yeah)  
No one or nothing can change  
Forever yours, I'll remain  
Here I Stand...

Do I remind you of the pain  
That he put you through, girl  
Is that the reason I'm to blame  
Before I do it...  
  
Is it because he, treated you badly  
I always stand accused  
Protecting yourself, from somebody else  
I'm not who's hurting you girl  
  
[Chorus]  
And it's killing me girl knowing you compare me to him  
Always guilty before the sin  
I can't win, I can't win no  
I'll do anything to prove I love you  
Baby girl but I refuse to  
Pay for something I didn't do  
I love you, girl  
But I refuse to stay  
Paying for his mistakes  
  
He left a scar across your heart  
I understand, girl  
Don't let his wrongs tear us apart  
Cause girl I'm your man  
  
Just because he did  
You swear I'm cheating  
You think I just don't care  
Why must I do time  
For another man's crime  
Girl you know that ain't fair  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I know he did you wrong  
But tell me what does that have to do with me  
Trying to show you something real  
Figure out what is going on  
Before you look up and I'll be gone...  
  
I'll do anything to prove I love you  
Baby girl but I refuse  
To pay for something I didn't do, girl  
I love you, and I love you I love you  
  
I'll do anything to prove I love you  
Baby girl but I refuse  
To pay for something I didn't do, no  
I love you, girl  
But I refuse to stay  
Paying for his mistakes

You're frustrated 'cause I don't react  
Maybe you want some feedback  
'Cause normally my feelings don't show

Every time I look up

Cause even when I'm not around you  
I hear from my friends you be asking 'bout me  
(What's up with him - that's what you be saying)  
  
I don't really care  
How long you've been together with your man?  
It's just a matter of time  
Before I make you mine

Up into your room I'm your groom  
But I ain't got a wedding ring  
  
I think sex was made for strangers  
Making love is for the ones who plan to stay together  
How 'bout we embrace the danger

You were with me  
But you never let your old thang go  
I don't care to know why  
Girl I guess some things  
Can't be explained  
  
[Chorus]  
It is what it is (what it is)

'Cause I'm feelin' something else (I'm feeling something else)

[Intro]  
Girl, understand why  
See it's burning me to hold onto this  
I know this is something I gotta do  
But that don't mean I want to  
What I'm trying to say is that I-love-you I just

And its better for me to let it go now than hold on and hurt you  
I gotta let it burn  
[Verse 1]  
It's gonna burn for me to say this  
But it's coming from my heart

But we done been fell apart  
Really wanna work this out  
But I don't think ya gonna change ya

Think it's best we go our separate ways  
Tell me why I should stay in this relationship  
When I'm hurting baby, I ain't happy baby  
Plus there's so many other things I gotta deal with  
I think that you should let it burn  
[Chorus]  
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to  
But you know gotta let it go cause the party ain't jumpin' like it used to  
Even though this might bruise you  
Let it burn  
Let it burn  
Gotta let it burn  
Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you  
Hate the thought of her being with someone else  
But you know that it's over  
You know that it was through  
Let it burn  
Let it burn  
Gotta let it burn

Callin' her your name  
Ladies tell me do you understand?  
Now all my fellas do you feel my pain?  
It's the way I feel

Now it's too late  
I know she ain't coming back  
What I gotta do now  
To get my shorty back  
Oh oh oh oh

Without my boo  
You've been gone for too long  
It's been fifty-eleven days, um-teen hours

[Chorus]  
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to  
But you know gotta let it go cause the party ain't jumpin' like it used to  
Even though this might bruise you  
Let it burn (let it burn, let it burn, you gonna learn)  
Let it burn (gotta let it burn)  
Gotta let it burn  
Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you  
Hate the thought of her being with someone else  
But you know that it's over  
You know that it was through  
Let it burn  
Let it burn  
Gotta let it burn  
[Bridge]  
I'm twisted cause one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on  
On the other side I wanna break down and cry (oh)  
I'm twisted cause one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on  
On the other side I wanna break down and cry (yeah)  
[Breakdown]

[Usher]  
Know ya, know ya...

It only happens once in a lifetime  
I'ma need a bite of that perfect with you baby  
You got me and I got you baby  
(?) is mine and I won't lose if you chosin' baby  
Baby you know that you more than just a friend to me  
Don't let nobody convince you that we enemies  
I was down for the count, I was down we was out  
And I (?) woulda led to me  
You'se my little secret  
They don't know you freaky, with a chick like you I'm conceited  
And when my mama fuck with you and my brother fuck with you, need the baby in
the crib where we completed  
You got money, I got money, no competin'  
F gang but we always on some G shit  
I'm on some OG with the D'usse, I'ma beat it  
Beep-beep-beep-beep (?) beat it  
(?) is the truth  
Trust in me like I trust in you  
Fuck with me like I fuck with you  
How am I real if I ain't real with you?  
  
Let me love ya, me love ya, let me love ya  
Let me be the one to, let me be the one to love you  
Let me love ya  
Love you babe  
We weren't sayin' ohhhh  
Love you, ohhhh, love you ohhhhh, love you ohhhh  
  
You are the realist bitch out here, we all admit that you the shit  
New BMW, new tint so dark the cops gotta squint  
You drivin' out the city to make money that I'll never let you spend  
There's something wrong, niggas will just never comprehend  
We hit the strip together and we trip together  
Hit the lick together, oh  
Hit the (?) together, book the Ritz together  
This is it forever, oh  
Hit the (?) 1000 dollar outfit  
Cause I gotta flex for my baby  
We just swerved on these hoes  
(?) on these hoes, I wanna know  
  
(When you gon' love me you gon' love me baby)  
Let me love ya, me love ya, let me love ya  
Let me be the one to, let me be the one to love you  
Let me love ya  
(I need ya, let me save ya babe)  
(You gotta know I ain't takin' over)  
(I really love ya)  
(Let me love you, I'm gonna love you)  
(Who gon' treat you the best? Who gon' treat you the best?)  
(Let me love you girl)  
  
Ready  
Told you I was ready  
Said that I was ready for you  
Ready  
I'ma show you  
  
(Never really mattered too much...)

I can't let nothing come in between the two of us  
Cause it's like your all I need  
Since we been together and,  
Whenever I'm in need of a little love  
It's OK for me to open up  
But I just can't give me heart to anyone cause  
  
[Bridge]  
Some only come in your life for a season  
And stay a while to give you a reason  
To take time to the very end  
And to think that its forever  
But you've given me someone that I  
Can believe in I know there will be times  
We can't come to an agreement  
But I know that we'll figure out the ups and down  
Tell me are you willing to take a chance? Baby if so  
  
[Chorus]  
Here we go (here we go)  
Let me put you in my hand,  
C'mon (c'mon)  
I wanna be your man  
Lets do it right,  
So that you'll be with me a lifetime  
You know and I know  
Don't think that I'm talking crazy,  
Your mama and my mama want some grand babies tonight  
Would you be with me a lifetime  
  
I used to think that it was hopeless  
And that I should just give it up (give it up)  
But I couldn't stop until I found myself a good girl  
To be in love  
  
I checked every state and city  
And looked all around the world  
And I'm proud to say that my search ends here  
Cause your one in a million to me and I can't let you go  
  
[Bridge]  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Listen, season are truly meant to change  
However, love can be the reason you fall  
But when you find that special someone  
You'd be willing to give them a lifetime, I love you and I choose you,  
Follow me.  
  
[Bridge]  
  
[Chorus]

"You know I wanna  
Get a little somethin'  
You didn't know  
Little,  
It ain't what you got baby  
It's what you do with it  
And you doin' it  
You doin' it"  
  
And my guilty pleasure is inspiring my desire  
Caught in a love affair with feminine narcotic style  
So fine, you got good taste  
But I hate to see your pretty body go to waste  
Before I see you in the bare necessities  
Like Coco de Mer or La ?, babe  
Get me aroused in that intimate attire  
Erotic fantasies, you know just what I like  
Think you got a secret, everybody knows  
Lady in the street, in bed hos and me  
Wearin' Cosabella with nothin' but a trench coat  
Nothin's better  
  
Girl, you're sexy  
When you slip it on  
Love to see you in it  
If you add a little splash  
You can have a lot of fun  
(You know what I'm talkin' about)  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause I'm a freak for sexy lingerie  
Wearing a teddy and a thong with the high-strung lace  
Sew on that garter, if you wanna make me go harder,  
Do G strings and pumps  
A sheer baby doll, put it on  
Is it up to her  
  
Girl, you're a goddess  
So when you sip that ? on,  
Stop, your sexy silhouette  
On the wall turns me on, oh  
Good god, your bod, and my bod  
Keep deep, don't mope when I say  
Nice but nasty, I wanna tell your man  
I do what I say  
  
Girl, you're sexy  
When you put it on  
Love to see you in it  
'Cause when you add a little splash  
You can have a lot of fun  
(You know what you're doin')  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
What you gonna do  
You gonna put it on  
Girl, you so sexy  
Ain't gotta take it off  
I want you to feed my fetish  
Slide them thigh highs down  
Looking at you got me up  
Throw them heels back on, c'mon  
  
Oh  
  
Put it on  
Girl you know you turn me on  
On, hey, oh  
  
[Chorus: x3]

I'm alone in this room  
The only thing that's on my mind is you  
I can't lie and say that I don't hear your call at night  
That's something for 'ya  
Got plenty to go around  
I guess I gotta remind you how I put it down  
  
[Chorus]  
There's too many women in here and I wanna  
Love 'em all  
Love 'em all  
Love 'em all  
And I just can't pick one out of them so I'm a  
Cut 'em all

And there's enough of me to make sure  
I pleasure all these girls in this club, yeah (club, yeah)  
I'm gonna make sure its fair  
Gone do you and you and you and you  
And then I'm gonna do her  
Okay lets get it straight up  
Ladies get in line, yeah

If you want me to get to you  
  
There's too many women in here and I wanna

And I just can't pick one out of them so I'm a

On the couch in V.I.P

First see the city sky lights  
Shining from my room  
Your such a sight to see  
In the month of June  
Beautiful like the moons  
Reflection when its passing off your skin  
And before you let me in I hear you say!  
  
It's been a long time  
I say OK k k k  
Don't worry I got you  
Then you say!  
How bout some foreplay  
I got that got plenty  
I got you  
Then you say,  
Play some slow whine  
Got that Sade, Al Green, and Marvin Gaye to  
  
To love you gently  
Let me love you gently  
  
Lay back relax  
Girl I'ma be  
Light as a feather  
Hard as a rock  
Cause daddy know just what you like  
  
Gonna love you  
Gently  
Light as a feather  
But hard as a rock  
  
See I know just when to finish  
And I know just wen to start  
And I be lovin' your reaction  
Every time I hit that spot  
Gently but it's soft like leather  
Gently but the top is hard  
Whisper your pleasures  
And then do my job  
  
Make it rain intense  
Girl let me do what I do  
I don't know whats echoing louder  
The music or you  
  
Gently I supposed to be done yet  
But you gettin' real warm  
Like the comin' of thunder  
Right after the storm  
  
You say you say  
Do you say girl  
  
Gonna push you to the limit  
Its yours its yours  
See I can place and win the race  
I'ma be your number one  
To the sunshine  
  
Here comes the sun  
Lets try to touch the moon again  
Forevermore  
  
Let me touch you  
Gently thats the sound of love  
Take them shades off the wall  
Light as feather  
But hard as rock  
  
This might not be in the bedroom  
But I'ma love you girl  
Gently  
Light as a feather  
But hard a s rock  
  
Let me touch you,  
Gently  
Light as a feather  
But hard as a rock

[Intro]  
Been through hell, now I'm hell proof  
Pouring cups of whiskey to get through it  
Oh sweet child of mine, gone way too soon  
Lost myself and lost my faith too  
  
[Hook]  
I've had my share of ups and downs  
I've had my share of down and outs  
Baptized in a river and almost drowned  
Thats when I figured out  
I'm stronger than ever now, stronger than ever now  
I'm stronger than ever now, stronger than ever now  
Stronger than ever now  
Ohh  
[Verse]  
Walk through fire now I'm fireproof  
Forever wear these scars like tattoos  
Finally found paradise right in my view  
And its killing me that I can't share it with you  
  
[Hook]  
I've had my share of ups and downs  
I've had my share of down and outs  
Baptized in a river and almost drowned  
Thats when I figured out  
I'm stronger than ever now, stronger than ever now  
I'm stronger than ever now, I'm stronger than ever now  
  
(Stronger than ever now)  
  
[Verse]  
Though you're gone you still live in my mind  
The only thing we ran out of is time  
Since you left I ain't been quite the same  
I wonder if you miss me, do I make you proud  
Know you're watching me, I feel your spirit  
I keep you right by my side  
I'm stronger than ever now, far from perfect  
Life will knock you down, get back up  
Fight for whats worth it  
Be strong enough, I know its easier said than done  
  
[Bridge]  
Stronger than ever now  
I been through it, now stronger  
Stronger now, hey stronger now  
All that I been through some how I found my way out  
Long as I believe in me, I know I can make it  
I know you'll make it, cause you're stronger  
Stronger than ever now  
Stronger

[Intro]  
I just wanna  
I just wanna take my time, my time, my time with you  
Oooh, oooh  
  
[Verse 1]  
We're here alone while the thunder is roaring  
And the windows are blowing  
'Cause it's storming and pouring tonight  
I put my hand on your chest  
I can feel your heart  
And it's beating kinda fast, so is mine  
In this moment of silence, you look me in the eyes  
Nothing is verbalized, but so much is said  
I need you so much  
The more I'm away from you, the more of you I want  
Oooh, oooh  
Oooh, oooh  
(I need you)  
[Bridge]  
I want to hold you till I can't feel again  
Until your soul lets me in  
  
[Chorus]  
Tell me that you wanna make love  
Tell me that you wanna relieve love  
Tell me that you wanna make love, yeah  
Baby, I'm a man that believes in what it is  
  
[Verse 2]  
We're going to a whole 'nother level  
When we do it, it's so true  
And it's so much more than sexual tonight  
When we're connected, every touch, every kiss is perfected  
It's like when we finally found what we been looking for  
It gets better and better with time  
This is deeper than love  
The more of you I have the more of you I want  
Oooh, oooh  
(Oh, I need you, baby)  
Oooh, oooh  
(Woah)  
  
[Bridge]  
I want to hold you till I can't feel again  
Until your soul lets me in  
  
[Chorus]  
Tell me that you wanna make love  
Tell me that you wanna relieve the love  
Tell me that you wanna make love, yeah  
Baby, I'm a man that believes in what it is  
  
[Post-Chorus]  
Oooh, oooh  
Hey, hey  
Oh baby, can we go deeper?  
Deeper than the surface  
Further than that  
  
[Bridge]  
I want to hold you till I can't feel again  
Until your soul lets me in  
  
[Chorus]  
Tell me that you wanna make love  
Tell me that you wanna relieve the love  
Tell me that you wanna make love, yeah  
  
[Verse 3]  
Woman and man, fight so hard  
But when the two become one, we work out our problems  
And we fix i, whenever we get body to body  
Body to body, body to body  
(Ohhh, heeee, ohhhh, heeee)  
(I want you)  
When you so wet and I'm so hard  
And when the two become one, it's like oh my God  
And then we feeling like our spirits want to leave our body  
Leave our body, leave our body  
(Ohhh, heeee, ohhhh, heeee)  
(I want you)  
  
[Bridge]  
Until your soul lets me in  
I want to  
  
[Verse 4]  
Woman and man, fight so hard  
But when the two become one, we work out our problems  
And we fix it, whenever we get body to body  
Body to body, body to body  
(Ohhh, heeee, ohhhh, heeee)  
(I want you)  
When you so wet and I'm so hard  
And when the two become one, it's like oh my God  
And then we feeling like our spirits want to leave our body  
Leave our body, leave our body  
(Ohhh, heeee, ohhhh, heeee)  
(I want you)  
  
[Outro]  
Until your soul lets me in

Say you'll never leave me, say you'll never go

Holding on to someone new  
Don't make me lose my mind  
Seems like I been here before  
Baby I can't take no more  
Of you trying to play me out baby

After all the wrong you've done to me  
I can't go on feeling like I do  
Cause my heart loves you

Holding on to someone new

Of you trying to play me out baby  
  
Don't waste my time  
Cause someone like me you'll never find  
I thought we had a good thing  
But I was wrong and now I must move on  
  
To another love one that I can trust  
With my heart I know she'll never run away  
Just can't talk no more  
So I'm out the door  
Talk to me  
Why you wanna play love games  
  
All the time I think of you

(You know your gonna need me)

And still I want you, want you, want you, want you, want you

And get inside ya mind  
I would take back all my words

See baby girl I was blind  
And I wish that I could try  
To be the man that you deserve  
Give me one chance to make it work  
  
It's driving me crazy (It's driving me crazy)  
Cause I'm missing my baby (Missing my baby)

But I need her and she told me I'm gunna want her back  
Shoulda believed her  
Now I'm wishing I could throw me back  
To the same spot where we found L-O-V-E at  
Lose some then I lose again, when am I gunna win some?  
I said alot of things out of anger, but I meant some  
I brought alot of things to the table, besdies income  
I just want things to go back how they use to be  
I was use to you, and I thought you were use to me  
Time was against us  
You never miss something 'till it's gone  
That's my word ma, you convinced me  
It might not happen, but I'm still hopin  
And my heart is broken, but the door is still open  
Pillow still soakin, ya boy still loc'in  
Dutch still lit, and a bottle still open  
And if I don't get another chance  
It might be hard to get focused  
  
It's driving me crazy (It's driving me crazy)  
Cause I'm missing my baby (Missing my baby)  
I'm goin' outta my mind and I'm runnin' outta time  
Oh I wish I could find you girl

Cause I been needin' you lately (Needing you lately)  
The love of my life but I wasn't loving you right baby  
  
It's driving me crazy (It's driving me crazy)  
Cause I'm missing my baby (Missing my baby)

Oh I wish I could find you girl  
So I'm about to go crazy (About to go crazy)  
Cause I been needin' you lately (Needing you lately)

Oh, oh, oh, T-T-P  
Oh, oh, oh, T-T-P  
  
Somebody tell me  
Why do people stay in situations that''ll never work  
Thinkin' bout you wanna leave and  
You can't wait to get even  
  
When deep inside it really hurts  
I never should have gotten in the mix  
You never understand till you go through it  
All the rights things you say  
  
Wrong things to do  
While you're out tryna pick and choose  
  
You should be lookin' for a TTP  
Now that I know the difference  
That's all I'm tryna be with  
Somebody that keeps it all in together now  
  
I'm living better  
Since I found my total package  
  
You should be lookin' for a TTP  
Now that I know the difference  
That's all I'm tryna be with  
Somebody that keeps it all in together now  
  
I'm living better  
Since I found my total package  
  
I used to be young and dumb  
And always wanted to run in the streets  
'Cause I thought that was where it was at  
But it wasn't all it did was leave a brother in the cold  
  
With nowhere to go  
I caught myself slippin'  
Thinkin' I was the lick, I was trippin'  
Tried to jump dip to dip  
  
I thought it was a way to be happy  
Until somebody took time to tell me  
  
You should be lookin' for a TTP  
Now that I know the difference  
That's all I'm tryna be with  
Somebody that keeps it all in together now  
  
I'm living better  
Since I found my total package  
  
You should be lookin' for a TTP  
Now that I know the difference  
That's all I'm tryna be with  
Somebody that keeps it all in together now  
  
I'm living better  
Since I found my total package  
  
So many people think  
They got it - but they don't have a clue  
You gotta have more than just a body  
For me to be talkin' about you oh  
  
Take it from me when playin' the game you're day will come  
When you gotta stop and start lookin' for the world  
  
You should be lookin' for a TTP  
Now that I know the difference  
That's all I'm tryna be with  
Somebody that keeps it all in together now  
  
I'm living better  
Since I found my total package

[Chorus: x 2]  
  
Morning is coming and

Bed of red rose pedals

All over again

Oh so sexy  
Oh baby you sure

[Chorus: x 2]  
  
Let me twerk it

Damn the club tonight girl

Let me work it

I'm not waiting at home for you, bye bye

Yo, I ain't seeing you in a minute, but I got something to tell ya, listen.  
  
See the thing about you, that caught my eye,  
Is the same thing that makes me change, my mind.  
Kinda hard to explain, but girl, I'll try.  
You need to sit down, this may take a while.  
You see, she sorta looks, just like you.  
She even smiles, just the way you do.  
So innocent, she seemed, but I was schooled  
I'm reminded when I look at you, but,  
  
You remind of a girl, that I once knew.  
See her face whenever I, I look at you.  
You won't believe all of the things that she put me through.  
This is why I just can't get with you.  
  
Thought that she was the one for me,  
Til I found out she was on her dream,  
Oh, she was sexing everyone, but me.  
This is why we could never be.  
  
You remind of a girl, that I once knew.  
See her face whenever I, I look at you.  
You won't believe all of the things that she put me through.  
This is why I just can't get with you.  
  
I know it's so unfair to you,  
But I'd be lingering the rest to you,  
Wish I knew, wish I knew how to separate the two  
You remind me, whoa  
  
You remind of a girl, that I once knew.  
See her face whenever I, I look at you.  
You won't believe all of the things that she put me through.  
This is why I just can't get with you.  
  
You remind of a girl, that I once knew.  
See her face whenever I, I look at you.  
You won't believe all of the things that she put me through.  
This is why I just can't get with you.

When you give it up, you get it on  
What happened to you yeah  
From the beginning I knew what I was getting  
But I was with it, and I'll admit that  
She was clear it was a kinda thing  
It wouldn't be easy for me to let it go  
For my time I got money, but money don't buy time  
I got a head, some got left behind  
The world is yours, just sign this dotted line  
  
And in no time, I hear, money, clothes, fancy cars  
Big old cribs, platinum on the wall, seven Grammys  
Sold out concerts, damn I've been working hard  
Private jets to France, many women  
I didn't have a ball  
You can say I've made it  
But I've faded 'cause I miss you  
Can we go back  
But the issue is time we can't get back  
What happened to you, yeah, come back  
'Cause I miss you, can we go back  
What happened to you  
What happened to you  
  
Did what I wanted, freaked all the honeys  
I stayed only mine, mind was on the money  
Had whatever, whenever, heart throb forever  
Black, young, and clever  
  
When you give it up, you get it on  
Love would be the only reason to look back  
And once you turn it on, you can't turn it off  
But picture me complaining with all this  
  
Money, clothes, fancy cars  
Big old cribs, platinum on the wall, seven Grammys  
Sold out concerts damn I've been working hard  
Private jets to France, many women  
I didn't have a ball  
You can say I've made it  
But I'm faded 'cause I miss you  
Can we go back  
But the issue is time we can't get back  
What happened to you, yeah, come back  
'Cause I miss you, can we go back  
What happened to you  
What happened to you  
  
What sense does it make to have everything and nothing  
At the same time  
Where are you  
I need you, yeah  
I'm looking for you,  
Girl, come and share all this  
  
Money, clothes, fancy cars  
Big old cribs, platinum on the wall, seven Grammys  
Sold out concerts damn I've been working hard  
Private jets to France, many women  
I didn't have a ball  
You can say I've made it  
But I'm faded 'cause I miss you  
Can we go back  
But the issue is time we can't get back  
What happened to you, yeah, come back  
'Cause I miss you, can we go back  
What happened to you  
I'm happy for you, wherever you are

If I could I'd tell you (I would tell you how)  
I feel girl, when I'm close to you  
At times I'd wish that my (heart could tell you how)  
Much I love you, but my heart speaks in whispers...  
  
If my heart could speak you'd know  
Girl if my heart could speak you'd know  
That I love you so (and I'll never let you go oh-no)  
  
If you can feel what I felt (just now, kiss me)  
To prove that your love for me is true  
Two hearts that beat as one, send signals  
To each other in whispers...  
  
[Chorus]  
I would tell you how I felt, if i could find the words  
To describe (the way I feel when you are near)  
Whenever you are by my side  
What I feel inside is deep and I just don't know  
What to say (because my words get in the way)  
Everytime I try to say (I love you) what I feel  
Deep inside  
  
[Chorus]

Can you help me?  
Anybody out there help me  
Please can you help me?  
  
Excuse me mister, I fell on hard times, I need some help  
But don't need a dime, don't earn a way, I'll wash your clothes  
If you let me stay, find your revoke,  
  
[Chorus]  
Day after day, people walk by, I can't catch their eyes  
I Pull out my sign,  
It says:  
Will work for love  
I will, I will, I will  
I'll work for love, overtime  
Baby, it says will work for love  
I will, I will, I will  
I'll work for love, for all my life  
I will work for love  
  
Can you help me? (help me)  
Anybody out there help me (does anybody out there)  
Please can you help me?  
  
Excuse me you two, got love to spare?  
Search my whole heart, it ain't none in there  
Pardon me sister, I'm on my last  
Don't have no love, that's OK, God bless  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It says:  
Will work for love  
I will, I will, I will  
I'll work for love, overtime  
Baby, it says will work for love  
I will, I will, I will  
I'll work for love, for all my life  
I will work for love  
  
I remember the day I lost my heart (hey yeah)  
Took it for granted I went too far  
Fall down, cried, and then begged, to feel that love again  
I hold on this sign till the very end  
Do anything  
  
I will, I will, I will  
I'll work for love, overtime  
Baby, it says will work for love  
I will, I will, I will  
I'll work for love, for all my life  
I will work for love

I can't win, I can't reign.  
I will never win this game without you, without you.  
I am lost, I am vain.  
I will never be the same without you, without you.  
I won't run, I won't fly.  
I will never make it by without you, without you.  
I can't rest, I can't fight.  
All I need is you, and I without you, without you.  
Oh oh oh, you, you, you, without you.  
You, you, without you.  
Can't erase, so I'll take blame.  
But I can't accept that we're estranged, without you.  
  
I can't quit now, this can't be right.  
I can't take one more sleepless night, without you, without you.  
I won't soar, I won't climb.  
If you're not here, I'm paralyzed.  
Without you, without you.  
I can't look, I'm so blind.  
Lost my heart, lost my mind without you, without you.  
Oh oh oh, you, you, you.  
Without you, you, you.  
Without you.  
I am lost, I am vain.  
I will never be the same without you, without you.  
Without you.

U R The One  
Verse 1  
It was like 6 of us  
3 in the Benz, 3 in the truck  
On... 85 headed to the Plush  
Ten minutes later when we pulled up  
I parked the Benz, hit the alarm, glanced down at my rims  
Tucked my pant leg in the tongue of my Tims  
Hand in my shirt to reveal my gems  
Proceeded to walk in  
Just then I saw this  
Magnificent misses, sippin' on a glass of Cris  
With a couple of her friends gigglin' I knew  
  
[Chorus]  
U R the one  
I don't give a damn  
Even if ya got a man take my hand, girl  
U R the one  
Girl I know you'll understand  
If u just give me a dance, take a chance, girl  
  
Verse 2  
Said, I know u got a few with u  
Don't even trip I got my crew here too  
Keep it real what u wanna do  
I really wanna chill with u  
Tell ya friends they can hop in the truck, we'll take the Benz  
But if we split up maybe we can hook up again  
U never know I guess that all depends  
If I can get u from the floor to the door of my 6-0-0  
2.0 momo's on low Pro's  
So finish that Mo', get your coat  
Tell ya girls c'mon let's go, 'cause  
  
[Chorus]  
  
U-S-H-E-R, say it  
U-S-H-E-R, 1-2-3, say it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
U-S-H-E-R, say it  
U-S-H-E-R, 1-2-3, say it
