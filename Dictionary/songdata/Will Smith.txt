Big Will the high roller  
Strolling through with an entoruage  
Hard to camaflouge when you livin' this large  
I be smooth like debarge with a five car garage  
  
Out for the night with my squad and we be flossin' down the fifteen  
My whole auroa gleamin'  
Who that kid in the green v  
Envy brother schemin'  
  
I ain't thinkin' bout them  
Racing chicks in the pink b.m.  
With my speakers tweakin'  
Freakin' off this weekend  
  
In Las Vegas boss players all across the board move makers and shakers  
Money can't break us but the places it can take us  
Big will in the limelight rhyme tight  
And we goin' have some fun tonight  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
Now how we do it  
(you know it's Big Willie style baby)  
Now how we doin' it  
(you know it's Big Willie style)  
  
I'm in a five star casino shuttin' crap tables down (boom)  
Non bettin' willie watchers standin' around  
Strictly millionaire status you can feel the eyes lookin' at us  
How bad they want to be us (parlay)  
  
Charlie Mack got my back with his eyes on my stack  
Brothers don't know how to act when you drive a four-five black  
People stop and stare havin' drinks at the bar  
A round for everybody with these big willie cards  
  
From civllians to stars they want to know who we are  
It's me big Will Nas Escobar J.L. Omar  
Carry money bags collect the chips then we all quick to exit  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's Left Eye with a tight crew  
Representin' like it's ladies night  
Comin' right through  
Don't be spiteful  
  
Plus an eyeful  
Sportin' hot pink  
Rocks in the link  
In the drop with a mink  
  
Like my shit don't stink  
Got you in the palm with a bomb like Sadamm  
Blowing up spots then runnin' off with the pot  
Left Eye ready for action  
  
The main attraction  
I'm in the fast lane passin'  
Breakin' you down like fractions  
While we be rappin' about things that really happen  
  
Big willie style Philly style let's make it happen  
With mademouselle from gezals to versace  
With a sweet smell  
This female leadin' the posse  
  
Got jokes like Cosby  
In the lots where the cars be  
With no apologies it's Left Eye  
Big Will let the champagne spill  
  
Is it a mans thing for real  
Can us girls roll wit y'all  
What the deal  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well now it's lookin' like a car show  
Convoys and whips on the strip  
Pullin' up in the six makin' brothers sick  
For real  
  
Big Will household name  
Entertainer  
Gold handle cane and matchin' gators  
Swervin' lane  
  
In pole position rolling deep like a co-malition  
In soul position and can rock a whole convention  
Movie screens to the club scene  
My whole crew lookin' clean  
  
Shine with a diamond gleam  
Step above where the players be  
Don't hate me  
One is where they rate me  
  
Lately you could find me  
Behind the door marked V.I.P.  
Eating grapes under the A.C.  
Big willie style is how we do it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(This one goes out to all the big willies)

  
Yo back up now and give a brother room  
The fuse is lit and I'm about to go boom  
Mercy mercy mercy me  
My life is a cage but on stage I'm free  
Hyped up syched up ready for wil'in'  
Standing in a crowd of girls like an island  
I see the one I wanna sic come here cutie  
I flip 'em around and then I work that booty  
Work the body work work the body  
Slow down girl you're 'bout to hurt somebody  
Oh and yo let's get just one thing clear  
There's only one reason why I came here  
Ya really done want me to tig-a-tig-a-tig-a tell ya wassup (go)  
Ya really done want me to tig-a-tig-a-tig-a tell ya wassup (go)  
Ya really done want me to tig-a-tig-a-tig-a tell ya wassup (go)  
I came here tonight to hear the crowd go  
  
Chorus:  
Boom! shake-shake-shake the room  
Boom! shake-shake-shake the room

Well yo are y'all ready for me yet  
(Pump it up prince)  
Well here I go here I go here I here I go  
Yo  
Dance in the aisles when the prince steps to it  
The rhyme is a football y'all and I went and threw it  
Out in the crowd and yo it was a good throw  
How do I know? because the crowd went hoooo  
In response to the way that I was kicking it  
Smooth and individual  
Rhymes always original  
Like the dr. jekyl man and this is my hyde side  
I am the driver and you're on a rap ride  
So fellas (yeah)  
Are y'all wit me (yeah)  
I said fellas (yeah)  
Are y'all wit me (yeah)  
Why don't you tell the girls what y'all wanna do  
Ya wanna ooh-ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh--ooooh  
That's right yo and I'm in the flow  
So pump up the volume along with the tempo  
I want everybody in the house to know  
I came here tonight to hear the crowd go  
  
Chorus  
  
Pump it pump it come on now  
Repeat 5x  
  
Yeah, come on now  
  
Chorus  
  
Here I go  
The the f-f-f-f-fresh p-p-p-prince is who I am  
So tell my mother that I never make a whack jam  
But some times I get n-nervous and start to stutter  
And I f-fumble every word for word I utter  
So I just try to ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-chill  
But it gets worse-a but worse-a but-but-but worse still  
I need the c-c-c-crowd to k-k-k-kick into it  
They help me calm down and I can get through it  
So higher higher  
Get ya hands to the ceiling  
Let it go y'all don't fight the feeling  
Mic in a strangle hold sweat pourin'  
And like jordan yo I'm scoring  
Yeah that's right y'all and I am in the flow  
So pump up the volume along with the tempo  
Many have died tryin' to stop my show  
I came here tonight to here the crowd go  
  
Chorus

I believe in God  
I believe in Destiny  
Not Destiny in the sense of all of our Exerts being pre-determined  
But Destiny in the Sense of our ability to choose  
Our ability to choose who we are and who we are supposed to be  
  
Yo, yo, yo, yo  
I was Born to reign  
Point Blank  
My name to be etched in stone  
My destiny preordained  
Trying to live righteous  
Fighting for life, this my life  
That's why I liked on my vices  
Tightening the vices of truth on the roofless  
This is rhyme and the crime and their minds is just useless  
The path of the poison, the genesis of the genisi  
You and your boys trying to decide, what to write  
But your hand is a sword and the blade has been forged  
Young minds getting gorged Stakes have been altered  
By lick or by weed and then hate gets exalted  
As art falls to greed, Choices is Made that's the voices is laid  
On the track, contract, the soldier wage, did you see his new benz,  
But your like a syringe now proud of your binge.  
  
Got a lot of new friends, got a lot of new ends  
Bought a house up in the hills fronting shouts to the pen  
Giving false accounts of your account's amounts  
Amounts the fans treason stands to reason since your inception  
Laced with deception and bred with false affection it must perish  
From the Terrace I see the fire burning the streets but I won't shield my eyes
to the heat  
Born to reign  
  
I was Born to reign  
  
I was Born to Reign

Early mornin' wake up  
Gently with the Caress on your hand  
And that Kimono that I bought you on my trip to Japan  
Sunshine peekin' through the venitian blinds  
  
Four years, and like wine, you got finer with time  
I got a question, if the prodda dressin' and the Gucci  
All got goes, and the freeze on the Lucci  
I mean real bad girl, I'm talking rougher than rough  
  
Do you think it'd be enough if we just had us?  
Don't answer quick, think about it cause I'm askin' for real  
Golddiggers goin' to hear this song drivin' and crash at the wheel  
Forever is a long time, so far we gettin' along fine  
  
No car I ever drove, no ice I ever saw  
No music I ever made, ain't nothin' I wanted more  
We could deal with whatever together  
Sunshine, all that other weather, when we chasin' forever  
  
[Chorus]  
I want to stay with you forever  
I want to spend all my life with only you  
I want to stay, lets stay together  
Chasing forever, with only you  
  
Chasin' forever, a buckwild, endeavorous scene  
Should we pursue with somethin' real or just chasin' a dream  
Or casin' the scene  
Fore I die I plan  
  
To see your soul and eternity in the palm of my hands  
Now as a man, there's certain things I'm lackin for sure  
But I'm committed to growin and coming at you mature  
In the future, I know it ain't gonna be all good  
  
But when we feelin' the hurt, if we willin' to work  
The eight ball will never turn to see us behind  
Though I ain't no knight, and my armor don't shine  
My mom said the lynch pin of love is trust  
  
An taught me monogomy is uh, monogamous  
Plus, for you dinner by candlelight  
Now don't commit before you sure you understand me right  
It's a race to a strange place, most see never  
It's a chase we gotta make together, forever  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now you would think after all my heartbreaks I'd be cruel  
Hiding behind my ego, evil but no  
Much the contrary, I'm very much certain  
You searchin' for joy, it's on the other side of hurtin'  
  
Finally found a person, worthy of all  
Instead of pushin' me down, you want to cushion my fall  
Your eyes could make the sun rise, all the birds sing  
Seal it with a kiss, bind it with a ring  
  
More carrats than even bugs could eat in a week  
An the ribbon in the sky, close your eyes don't peek  
I'll tell you what I see in the future  
A hacienda so cute with, five little kids callin' you mom and callin' me dad  
  
Havin more good times than JJ had  
Judging by the look in your eyes, you see it  
Let no man sever, welcome to forever  
  
[Chorus: x3]

Yo  
When I released my first single back in like '86  
People was like oh you know that's popcorn and you know they weak  
You know then I mess around I go world trade on them  
Bangin' out them multi-plastic still got negativity to bring  
My thing is you can't say nothing nice don't say nothing  
  
Take your place allow me to flex a taste  
As my accomplishments bring up my comp like mase  
Face me the star of stage and TV  
My face be seen in almost every country  
  
Grammy winner soon to be oscar nominee  
Who he that's dressed jiggy straight from west Philly  
Thought I was whack 'cause I wanted to act  
Now every brother and his mother that rap be trying to do that  
  
The ill kid  
Hundred million dollar bill kid  
The one you love to chill with come on keep it real kid  
Don't try to act like this summer at the greek  
  
You won't be bumpin' the big Willie in your jeep  
I know y'all still feel me  
Really don't act silly  
Thought I feel off just becuase I left Philly  
  
Took a break from the rap thing went on hiatus  
I picked up the art of acting and multiplied papers  
I chilled on silk sofas chatting with Operah  
She asked me if it's true that me and Jeff broke up  
  
While y'all kids busy playing drug pimp and playa  
I was at my crib in Barbados chillin' with Jada  
Vertex is me the magnanamous  
God you sayin' damn I've always been a fan of his  
  
Y'all know how it is oh wait hold up y'all don't  
Look here y'all don't say nothing than I won't  
  
Just don't say nothing  
  
Man I love being me ready to rock the block  
With some more hot top notch ---- for you to cop  
No more mr. nice guy  
My whole life I've been smiling when I felt like whiling  
  
Jealousy swinging on me made his attack  
(he soft he whack man that ain't real rap)  
You believe that  
It hurt me at first but it's cool  
  
Took the insults feed it to my ego for fuel  
Now everywhere I turn a dead end  
Hundred women coming at me waving pads and pens  
And they be screaming out  
  
(oh my lord)  
Did you see it's that brother from  
(ID4)  
Now can I please get  
  
(a picture and your signature)  
Sure you can miss  
(oh my god my girlfriends they ain't gonna beleive this)  
Worldwide wait nah hold up galactic  
  
Hear my name don't nothing change but the accent  
Bangok to Madagascar they wanna see me  
Prince epe in Spain Japan I'm cota eshe  
I like my steaks thick and my jets private  
  
And my son to ride in the cockpit  
I know he's only four taking lessons from the pilot  
While I'm on my cell with my broker getting stock tips  
Find a magazine and I read the hottest gossip  
  
Man who'd a thought my life would be such an interesting topic  
Well y'all know how it is wait hold up y'all don't  
Well look here y'all don't say nothing than I won't  
  
Just don't say nothing  
Just don't say nothing  
Just don't say nothing  
Just don't say nothing  
  
Go ahead adjust the balance and the bass in your speakers  
Make sure my voice sounding crisp in your tweeters  
I'm about to show you how a man like me works  
Shorty get ice five carrots and nothing cheaper  
  
Four five chromed out former two seater  
Fifty inch sony to watch Siskel and Ebert  
'Cause I'm about to get two thumbs ten toes one knee and probobly a couple  
Of elbows  
  
'Cause yo I'm the man and the whole world knows  
Rock film fests to vos and rap shows  
All the critics jealous people and back-stabbers  
My so-called friends who been nothing but actors  
  
You're way of charachter but now who's the bomb  
It's Will from west Phil just slightly transformed  
Y'all know what it is  
Ah damn that's right y'all don't  
But look here y'all don't say nothing then trust me I won't  
  
Just don't say nothing  
Just don't say nothing  
Just don't say nothing  
Just don't say nothing

Now, this is a story all about how  
My life got flipped-turned upside down  
And I'd like to take a minute  
Just sit right there  
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air  
  
In west Philadelphia born and raised  
On the playground was where I spent most of my days  
Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool  
And all shootin some b-ball outside of the school  
When a couple of guys who were up to no good  
Started making trouble in my neighborhood  
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared  
She said 'You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air'  
  
I begged and pleaded with her day after day  
But she packed my suit case and sent me on my way  
She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket.  
I put my Walkman on and said, 'I might as well kick it'.  
  
First class, yo this is bad  
Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass.  
Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like?  
Hmmmmm this might be alright.  
  
But wait I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that  
Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat?  
I don't think so  
I'll see when I get there  
I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air  
  
Well, the plane landed and when I came out  
There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out  
I ain't trying to get arrested yet  
I just got here  
I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared  
  
I whistled for a cab and when it came near  
The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror  
If anything I could say that this cab was rare  
But I thought 'Nah, forget it' - 'Yo, holmes to Bel Air'  
  
I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8  
And I yelled to the cabbie 'Yo holmes smell ya later'  
I looked at my kingdom  
I was finally there  
To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel Air

On your mark ready set let's go  
Dance floor pro I know you know  
I go psycho when my new joint hit  
Just can't sit  
Got to get jiggy wit it, thats it  
Now honey honey come ride  
DKNY all up in my eye  
You gotta Prada bag with a lot a stuff in it  
Give it to your friend let's spin  
Everybody lookin' at me  
Glancin' the kid  
Wish you nig was dancin' the jig  
Here with this handsome kid  
Ciga-cigar right from Cuba-Cuba

Watch your step you might fall  
Trying to do what I did  
Mama-unh mama-unh mama come closa'  
In the middle of the club with the rub-a-dub  
No love for the haters  
Mad cause I got floor seats at the Lakers  
See me on the fifty yard line with the Raiders  
Met Ali he told me I'm the greatest  
I got the fever for the flavor of a crowd pleaser  
DJ play another  
From the prince of this  
Your highness  
Only bad chicks ride in my whips  
South to the west to the east to the north  
Bought my hits and watch 'em go off a go off  
Ah yes yes y'all ya don't stop

Eight-fifty I.S. if you need a lift  
Who's the kid in the drop  
Who else Will Smith  
Livin' that life some consider a myth  
Rock from south street to one two fifth  
Women used to tease me  
Give it to me now nice and easy  
Since I moved up like George and Wheezey  
Cream to the maximum I be askin' 'em  
Would you like to bounce with the brother that's platinum  
Never see Will attackin' 'em  
I rather play ball with Shaq and 'em  
Flatten 'em  
Psyche  
Hittin' you thought I took a spill  
But I didn't  
Trust the lady of my life she hittin'  
Hit her with a drop top with the ribbon  
Crib for my mom on the outskirts of Philly  
You trying to flex on me  
Don't be silly

[Verse 1 (Will Smith)]  
Uh, check, check  
Yo, yo, yo  
Across the room shared a little gaze with me  
Crazy mama how your scent played with me  
Eyes never hiding your heart angelic looking  
Faking disinterest but I can tell you're looking  
Face to face her eye to eye stance with me  
Didn't even say nothing I felt you want to dance with me  
You push me back a little when I kissed your hand  
Said you was attracted to me truly but you had a man  
I put my finger up don't say nothing  
He ain't here is he? We can play or something  
He at the crib oh, I see you live with him  
What you gone get married to him and have some kids with him  
Us could be just a weekend thing  
Just a weekday thing, just a thing ma  
Look we can have everything else  
But for tonight let me have you for myself  
Girl holla at me  
  
[Chorus (Tra-Knox)]  
You can have the rest of your life  
Give me tonight  
You can have the rest of your life  
Give me tonight  
You can have the rest of your life  
Just give me tonight  
You can have the rest of your life  
Just give me tonight, give me tonight  
  
[Verse 2 (Will Smith)]  
Whoop! Whoop!  
Big Will coming through like  
Whoop! Whoop!

East girls off the hook ain't they  
Right, right  
  
[Tra-Knox]  
Baby girl  
You know exactly what I want  
No I'm not trying to replace your man  
I just want one night to you all over  
Baby girl  
This our secret rondevue  
Look in my eyes I'm telling you  
All I'm tryin' to do is change your view  
For a moment or two  
Baby girl  
I don't want to break up your happy home  
Baby I don't want to be alone  
So let me jump in the zone  
Can't you feel the Jones  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 3 (Will Smith)]  
Thinking of living your life as a hundred yards long  
Give me a quarter-inch that's all I'm asking  
Do the math I'm the sun you the earth  
Its you-N-I-verse and its the worst  
Cause I thirst to tape connect her  
I know you got a life momma  
Trust me I don't want to bring your life drama  
I can barely hear my think slide with me  
Dip out the side door take a ride with me  
Let me hear about (Uh)  
What you think about (Uh)  
What you need to do (Uh)  
The things you dream about  
Your Body with me but I know where your heart's at  
Let it ring ma call him back  
Wishing I could stop the clock to make it last with you  
Am I goin' be at home alone with a glass slipper  
Is it a sin to pretend with another fella  
Midnight the story ends like Cinderella  
  
[Chorus: x2]

[Chorus]  
It's all night  
And it's all right  
Til the sunlight

Thought my reign would end well now I'm rubbing it in

Out for a couple of years thought I had fallen  
You seen me with Denzel and Russel Crowe  
But yo the movies just a chick on the side I'm in love with the flow  
Time off to be an Oscar nominee now  
Back to the M-I-see to emcee now  
Rockin' the ol heads blazing the youth  
Only rapper had the president raising the roof  
Check the tape checkmate

Make your move  
Don't fight submission  
To dawn to dusk

Just don't miss the bus  
To jam on with us

[Chorus]

[Chorus]  
  
A hip hop superhero

Cape or a suit  
Hit the studio  
Every year or so  
And escape with the loot  
On my down time straight to the links  
I could pack a dance floor a movie theatre or truck from ?  
On Christmas, mom and wife douse em with ice  
AOL, search will smith thousands of sites  
And at the club, hands clapping toes tapping  
Sucker I'm the greatest thing ever happen to rapping (in Ali voice)  
Best shape of my life destined to show ya  
No scrapes or fender benders lead the game total  
Free don't move hip hop mogul  
Philly ain't happy I  
I be the guy to go  
The guy to go  
You know the go to go  
The mega man that got the whole crew like  
Damn will done did it again  
He done stepped up to the plate and he done hit it again

I'm about to ask you to take me home  
Please stop shakin', you got my will breakin'  
Love in Jamaica but I gotta go home  
Ten days I'm in Jamaica workin'  
Ain't had a chance to get out  
And do too much a nuthin' else but a workin'  
It's killin' me  
Ain't had a chance to get that chicken jerkin'  
Responsibility tasting victory but desire lurkin'  
He callin' me, I been recordin' writing vibin' and rhymin'  
Nothin' but heat haven't even had a chance to see the island  
I need that  
Me and the team we got a dreamer comin'  
Despite we heard about through word of mouth is club asylum  
Lets finish up and like the breeze of the seas we arrive at the party  
Hostess she desire flirtin' heavily with me  
Got me thinkin' things I really probably shouldn't be  
Every time she move, she look at me  
Girl stop shakin', you got my will breakin'  
Love in Jamaica but I gotta go home  
I got my girl waitin', I'm supposed to land at eight and  
If I'm not their then I can't go home  
Ma you got me bakin', I'm about to make a mistake and  
I'm about to ask you to take me home  
Please stop shakin', you got my will breakin'  
Love in Jamaica but I gotta go home  
Every time she moves  
I don't know how to act  
Came to get my groove on not to get my groove back  
Her eyes deep enough to swim in, she grinnin'  
Her innocence inspire thoughts of sin an'  
Crazy right, she got a flower so long and smilin'  
Her shakin' makin Jamaica seem like temptation island  
I'm wilin' 'cause man she hot  
What I'm a do  
Feeling like the moment of truth  
Making my conscious loving and move  
What's a brother to do  
Makin' me feen, desire the Jamaican queen  
Making me hatin' to leave 'cause the shakin' is mean  
Wind ya hips, got me going fine to this island miss  
But I'm monogomous so far y'all  
Girl stop shakin', you got my will breakin'  
Love in Jamaica but I gotta go home  
I got my girl waitin', I'm supposed to land at eight and  
If I'm not their then I can't go home  
Ma you got me bakin', I'm about to make a mistake and  
I'm about to ask you to take me home  
Please stop shakin', you got my will breakin'  
Love in Jamaica but I gotta go home  
Could it be deseree looking at me  
Sending messages sweet as free  
Trying to get away but she won't let me  
Oh no I'm trying to get home

My grin got longevity, got family backin me  
That's why I'm livin happily  
Ever after, love and laughter  
Hussle cause I wants to, not cause I have to  
Ask yourself, who made the polar caps melt?

Proposition by trio, in Rio  
Menage Trois, down at the Marde Gras  
But nah, my clothes by Versace  
My attitude cocky, the sym- it's Imanyaki  
Like a felon, no tellin what I do next  
I don't front cause I'm paid, but I do flex  
Southwestern, crib like a villa  
Vacation on a mountain in Manilla  
Rhyme spilla, real thrilla  
An it's real clear  
Y'all talkin East and West, I'm talkin hemispheres  
My papa raised no fool  
So many zeros on my check it's like, oooooooooooohh

Jada: But when the music starts you have to be quiet  
Jaden: K  

Now dad this is a very sensitive subject)  
From the first time the doctor placed you in my arms  
I knew I'd meet death before I'd let you meet harm  
Although questions arose in my mind, would I be man enough?  
  
Against wrong, choose right and be standin' up  
From the hospital that first night  
Took a hour just ta get the carseat in right  
People drivin' all fast, got me kinda upset  
  
Got you home safe, placed you in your basonette  
That night I don't think one wink I slept  
As I slipped out my bed, to your crib I crept  
Touched your head gently, felt my heart melt  
  
'Cause I know I loved you more than life itself  
Then to my knees, and I begged the Lord please  
Let me be a good daddy, all he needs  
Love, knowledge, discipline too  
I pledge my life to you  
  
[Chorus]  
Just the two of us, we can make it if we try  
Just the two of us, (Just the two of us)  
Just the two of us, building castles in the sky  
Just the two of us, you and I  
  
Five years old, bringin comedy  
Everytime I look at you I think man, a little me  
Just like me  
Wait an see gonna be tall  
  
Makes me laugh cause you got your dads ears an all  
Sometimes I wonder, what you gonna be  
A General, a Doctor, maybe a MC  
Haha, I want to kiss you all the time  
  
But I will test that butt when you cut outta line, trudat  
Uh-uh-uh why you do dat?  
I try to be a tough dad, but you be makin me laugh  
Crazy joy, when I see the eyes of my baby boy  
  
I pledge to you, I will always do  
Everything I can  
Show you how to be a man  
Dignity, integrity, honor an  
  
An I don't mind if you lose, long as you came with it  
An you can cry, ain't no shame it it  
It didn't work out with me an your mom  
But yo, push come to shove  
  
You was conceived in love  
So if the world attacks, and you slide off track  
Remember one fact, I got your back  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's a full-time job to be a good dad  
You got so much more stuff than I had  
I gotta study just to keep with the changin times  
101 Dalmations on your CD-ROM  
  
See me-I'm  
Tryin to pretend I know  
On my PC where that CD go  
But yo, ain't nuthin promised, one day I'll be gone  
  
Feel the strife, but trust life does go wrong  
But just in case  
It's my place  
To impart  
  
One day some girl's gonna break your heart  
And ooh ain't no pain like from the opposite sex  
Gonna hurt bad, but don't take it out on the next, son  
Throughout life people will make you mad  
  
Disrespect you and treat you bad  
Let God deal with the things they do  
'Cause hate in your heart will consume you too  
Always tell the truth, say your prayers  
  
Hold doors, pull out chairs, easy on the swears  
You're living proof that dreams do come true  
I love you and I'm here for you  
  
[Chorus: x4]  
  
(This is a good song dad, how much am I gettin' paid for this?)

Maybe  
Oh if I could pray and I try, dear  
You might come back home, home to me  
  
Maybe  
Whoa, if I could ever hold your little hand  
Oh you might understand  
Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, yeah  
  
Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe dear  
I guess I might have done something wrong  
Honey I'd be glad to admit it  
Oh, come on home to me!  
Honey maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe yeah  
  
Well I know that it just doesn't ever seem to matter, baby  
Oh honey, when I go out or what I'm trying to do  
Can't you see I'm still left here  
And I'm holding on in needing you  
  
Please, please, please, please  
Oh won't you reconsider babe  
Now come on, I said come back  
Won't you come back to me!  
  
Maybe dear, oh maybe, maybe, maybe  
Let me help you show me how  
Honey, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe  
Maybe, maybe, maybe, yeah  
Maybe, maybe, maybe, yeah  
Ooh!  

At 17 years old I started runnin' the streets  
Man, I had some fun in the streets  
11, 12, sometimes 1 in the streets  
By 18, I started seeing the sun in the streets  
My mom started trippin' on me  
Like Will, you gotta choose your friends carefully  
Like, I trust you but please call me  
And when you have kids of your own you'll see  
I'ma be here when all your friends won't  
But I was busy hollerin' parents just don't understand  
Now here I am with a family runnin' the lines she ran on me  
We ain't always see eye to eye but Mom, on your principles  
Now I rely, you got me tastin' my toes  
I didn't know  
Momma told me don't go down that road  
But I gotta go where I gotta go  
So take your fool telling me I told you so  
I used to roll hard with this dude named Chuck  
Rollin' in my car with this dude named Chuck  
My Mommy really liked this dude named Chuck  
She thought he was really and polite, Chuck  
And me used to roll out faithfully, inevitably  
You see Chuck, you gon' see me  
Like we on TV, the bosom is the buddy  
Share food, clothes, and money, and hunnies  
Flock like we was players from the NBA  
Still hurts to recall the day I heard him say  
To this girl named Mya  
I was diggin', he told her I was a liar  
Told her I be cheatin' on women  
Breakin' hearts and grinnin'  
He told her her life would be better with him in it  
That's the friend I chose  
I didn't know  
Momma told me don't go down that road  
But I gotta go where I gotta go  
So take your fool telling me I told you so  
Momma used to say, "Take your time young man  
I ain't always gonna be there , holding your hand  
But, you'll always know exactly where I am  
And when I'm not there in my place the Lord will stand  
Will study the world, only the wise succeed  
And when you're eyes tell lies your heart should lead  
You're gonna do dirt we all gon' sin  
But when you realize it, apologize and never do it again  
Mom told me don't rush to get old  
If you got youth, truth clutched in your hold  
It's like possibilities too much to behold  
An emotional shield from life's blustery cold  
Mom, all this stuff was hard you said was hard  
Childish disregard 'cause my head was hard  
Now, no question opposed, ugh  
I didn't know  
Momma told me don't go down that road  
But I gotta go where I gotta go  
So take your fool telling me I told you so

Before I buy your radio station and send you home  
Yo this is a warning shot over the bawl

You better chill before you climb a tree you can't get down  
  
[B SECTION]  
Ok, people dissing Will sat on a wall  
People dissing Will had a great fall  
All the king's horses and all the king's men  
Couldn't put none of their careers together again  
You get it  
  
[CHORUS 2X]

Willow  
Daddy can you tell me a story?  
Will  
Oh you want to hear a story? What kind of story you want to hear baby?  
Willow  
A scary story  
[VERSE 1]  
Oh, ok  
Once upon a time there was a kid who wanted nothin' more than to rhyme  
Almost like he was born in the rhyme  
He thought of his rhymes almost all of the time  
And he fought with his mom  
His school getting caught with his rhyme book  
And he knew he shouldn't of took it there in the first place  
At least he shouldn't of been sittin lookin there in her face with it  
Teacher told him get it out of her class  
Wicked witch, trick told him that's probably why you won't pass  
Now if you shy you won't last but you're new  
So underneath his breath before he left he said I'm a be richer then you  
What you say? She said.  
What you mean? He said.  
Boy don't you play, she said.  
What you mean? He said. Damnit.  
Ten minutes later standin up in the principles office  
Getting handed the phone clammed up cause his father was talking  
And he was pissed he wasn't listening to his son.  
You testing me? You messin up again  
You done boy.  
[CHORUS]  
This is just a story about a young man comin up in the rap game  
A real scary story  
Went from rags to riches it has goblins in it haters and witches. Uh.  
  
[REPEAT CHORUS]  
  
[VERSE 2]  
First thing he did was find somebody to give him some money.  
He wasn't stupid but wasn't using his senses honey.  
The guy's he meant was a little shady, a little funny.  
But they gave him the money so they played the record company.  
It sounds silly but when he grew up in Philly rhymin wasn't what it is today  
Deals wasn't a dime a dozen  
Today every sister, uncle, or mom or cousin gotta record deal  
But for real it wasn't like that then.  
As you could imagine when he started risin to fame and fortune he was  
havin Started antagonizing the guy's he was with  
At the same time he started realizing  
The deal he got from them guys in his eyes didn't fly with size of his hits  
He called a meeting to find a solution.  
He said I'm gettin beat out of my loot  
And I'm not recording no more until we find a solution  
The dude's said we found a solution its this .44  
He ran for the door a little shaken  
But the next day he found a lawyer, told him the situation  
He said I'm breakin this contract for ya  
He said how much the lawyer said I'm a charge you a quarter cause I like you  
Just do me a favor  
get your life in order  
  
[CHORUS]

Well once upon a time eccentric head shorty  
Where people wore pijamas and went to bed early  
There was a little boy, tight clout that might sprout  
Tried to help lead black folk the right route  
Delayed,Negative voices, many, once in prison  
for unwise choices that he once made  
Divide the men, cops were sent inside of him  
And seeing the good he had within him, let him out again  
The life no longer for a big time baller, vic  
Big Willies like Will Smith now call the kid (yo Rick)  
So check the gift, everything no negative  
That's what happens when you  
steer black folk away from negative  
Not to mention chasin' charts, killin' 'em  
There'll be a member of the Biz-Mark, Will, and Rick  
Demise sent, can't mess with the mindset  
Come run with us, December 1999 said  
It's all because of you, I'm feelin' sad and blue  
You went away, now my life is just rainy days  
I love you so, how much, you'll never know  
You took your love away from me  
Oh oh oh oh  
You took your love away from me  
Oh oh oh oh  
You took your love, you took your love, you took your love  
You took your love away from me  
Slick Rick  
Will Smith  
Biz Mark  
  
True dat, true dat  
Jazzy Jeff y'all  

Switch  
Alright ready  
Come on man, this is what I do  
Yo mic check, mic check, yeah here you go  
Nah, he over here  
Yeah, I heard he got that hot new thing  
It's called "Switch" (switch)  
Let's get it going  
  
Hey switch, turn it over and hit it  
Turn around, now switch  
Turn it over and hit it  
  
Hey, vibe to vibe a second, it's a club girl why you arrived naked  
Hear that, how the veteran glide the record  
But don't download, go out and buy the record  
Hey, something sexy bout her  
Girl on the floor, all her friends around her  
I mean real clean, ain't gotta touch or nothing  
It ain't like I like a chick on chick or something  
I'm just a sucker for a hot track  
Gimme a drink and a chick to tell 'Stop that'  
Dance is a hop and a clap, flip it round  
Now bring it on back, break it down  
Now switch  
  
Hey switch, turn it over and hit it  
Turn around, now switch  
Turn it over and hit it  
Uh uh uh  
  
I gotta question, I need to ask somebody  
Why is it that when y'all see me at the party  
Y'all be looking like, "Ooh, he a movie star  
He ain't supposed to be out on the floor with everybody"  
But oh wait, whoa, y'all forgetting  
When I was, amateur spitting before the scripts were written  
First one in, last one out the club  
Bursting in, passing out in the club  
Back at it, this cat is the wit and the charm  
Taking you higher, like a syringe hittin' ya arm  
Bringing the fire, making your Benz ring the alarm  
Let me see you clap, spin baby, come on  
Switch  
  
Hey switch, turn it over and hit it  
Turn around, now switch  
Turn it over and hit it  
  
Oh, you just gonna stand there, huh  
What you too cute to dance, or you scared  
It ain't really that hard to do and  
I ain't trying to be in love with you and  
All I wanted was a moment or two to  
See if you could do that switch-a-roo and  
Shut your mouth fool, get your crew and  
The thick body and the rear one too and  
I'll be right hear waiting on you to  
See if y'all can do that switch-a-roo  
  
Hey, hey  
  
That's what I'm talking bout, do that thing mama  
That's what I'm talking bout, do that thing mama  
That's what I'm talking bout, do that thing mama  
That's what I'm talking bout, switch  
  
Hey switch, turn it over and hit it  
Turn around, now switch  
Turn it over and hit it

Here it comes the party of a lifetime  
31st of December  
Man I remember when the ball dropped for 90  
Now it's 9-9, ten years behind me  
What's gonna happen?  
Don't nobody know  
We'll see when the clock gets to 12-0-0  
Chaos, the cops gonna block the street  
Man who the hell cares?  
Just don't stop the beat  
No time to sleep, yo it's on tonight  
K-C you feeling me right? (Yeah)  
2-0-0-0, the Will 2 K

Hold up it is  
  
Here it comes another year  
Come on everyone, new millennium  
Here it comes another year  
Everyone, new millennium  
  
There's a party tonight  
Everybody was drinking  
The house was screaming  
And the bass was shaking  
And it won't be long  
Till everybody knowing  
That twelve o'clock the roof will be blowing  
Drinks on me, up the cups, and  
Midnight coming full thrust, and  
Dick Clark holding it down, and  
The second hand rolling around (Na, na, na, na)  
Hundred thousands deep, world wide press  
Hate to be the man that gotta clean this mess  
Same resolution, get the money  
Ain't where we've been, it's where we gonna be  
Get ready to hum Auld Lang Syne  
Cause a person that know the words is hard to find  
First soul train line of the year  
Four, three, two, one  
  
Its here and I like it  
(Whoo! K-Ci y'all, K-Ci y'all)  
Gonna pack the dance floor

Say yeah, yeah

Say yeah, yeah

Say yeah, yeah

Say yeah, yeah  
(Ha-ha-ha)  
Yeah, yeah  
  
I remember trying to count how old I'd be  
When the clock struck twelve in the year two g  
Medianoche finally near  
This will be that anthem amongst the cheers  
Just the man to usher it in  
Big Will bringing the heat  
K-Ci bringing the plan  
Ringing it in, waiting for the ball to drop  
That 2000 vault we breaking the lock  
Let hip-hop keep blazing the charts  
May the past keep a warm spot in your heart  
May the future hold more joy then pain  
Hands in the air waiting for confetti to rain  
  
Its here and I like it  
Gonna pack the dance floor  
Rock the dance floor  
  
Here it comes another year  
Come on everyone, new millennium  
Here it comes another year  
Everyone, new millennium  
  
There's a party tonight  
Everybody was drinking  
The house was screaming  
And the bass was shaking  
And it won't be long  
Till everybody knowing at twelve o'clock  
At 12 o'clock  
Say what? Say what? Say what? What?  
  
Here it comes another year  
Come on everyone, new millennium  
Here it comes another year  
Everyone, new millennium
