Be still, for the presence of the Lord, the holy One, is here  
Come bow before him now with reverence and fear  
In him no sin is found we stand on holy ground  
Be still, for the presence of the Lord, the holy One, is here  
  
Be still, for the glory of the Lord is shining all around  
He burns with holy fire, with splendor he is crowned  
How awesome is the sight our radiant king of light  
Be still, for the glory of the Lord is shining all around  
  
Be still, for the power of the Lord is moving in this place  
He comes to cleanse and heal, to minister his grace  
No work too hard for Him, in faith receive from him  
Be still, for the power of the Lord is moving in this place

Be Thou my vision, oh Lord of my heart  
Naught be all else to me, save that Thou art  
Thou my best thought by day or by night  
Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light  
  
Be Thou my wisdom and Thou my true word  
I ever with Thee and Thou with me, Lord  
Thou my great Father, I Thy true son  
Thou in me dwelling and I with Thee one  
  
High King of Heaven my victory won  
May I reach heaven's joys, oh, bright heaven's sun  
Heart of my own heart whatever befall  
Still be my vision, oh Ruler of all  
  
Thou and Thou only first in my heart  
High King of Heaven, my treasure Thou art

Before the throne of God above  
I have a strong, a perfect plea  
A great high Priest whose Name is Love  
Who ever lives and pleads for me  
My name is graven on His hands  
My name is written on His heart  
I know that while in heaven He stands  
No tongue can bid me thence depart  
No tongue can bid me thence depart  
  
When Satan tempts me to despair  
And tells me of the guilt within  
Upward I look and see Him there  
Who made an end to all my sin  
Because the sinless Savior died  
My sinful soul is counted free  
For God the just is satisfied  
To look on Him and pardon me  
To look on Him and pardon me  
  
Behold Him there the risen Lamb  
My perfect spotless righteousness  
The great unchangeable I am  
The King of glory and of grace  
One with Himself I cannot die  
My soul is purchased by His blood  
My life is hid with Christ on high  
With Christ my Savior and my God!  
With Christ my Savior and my God!  
  
One with Himself I cannot die  
My soul is purchased by His blood  
My life is hid with Christ on high  
With Christ my Savior and my God!  
With Christ my Savior and my God!

In English:  
  
Pass me not, o gentle Savior  
Hear my humble cry.  
While on others thou art calling  
Do not pass me by.  
Savior, Savior, hear my humble cry  
While on others thou art calling do not pass me by.

It Is Well With My Soul  
Words and Music by Horatio Spafford  
  
When peace like a river attendeth my way  
When sorrows like sea billows roll  
Whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say  
  
It is well, It is well with my soul.  
It is well with my soul  
  
It is well, It is well with my soul.  
My sin, oh the bliss of this glorious thought  
My sin, not in part, but the whole  
Has been nailed to the cross  
So I bear it no more  
Praise The Lord, praise The Lord, oh my soul.  
  
And Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight  
The clouds be rolled back as a scroll  
The trump shall resound and The Lord shall descend  
Even so, it is well with my soul.

The gentle healer came into our town today  
He touched my eyes and the Darkness left to stay  
But more than the blindness  
He took their sins away  
The gentle healer came into our town today  
The gentle healer came into our town today  
He spoke one word that was all he had to say  
And one who had dies just rose up straight away  
The gentle healer came into our town today  
Oh he seems like just an ordinary man  
With dirty feet and rough but gentle hands  
But the words he says are hard to understand  
Yet he seems like just an ordinary man  
The gentle healer He left our town today  
I just looked around and found he?d gone away  
Some folks from town who followed him they  
The gentle healer is the truth, the life, the way  
The gentle healer it the truth, the life, the way  

Great is Thy faithfulness  
O God, my Father  
There is no shadow of turning with Thee  
Thou changest not  
Thy compassion's they fail not  
As Thou hast been,  
Thou forever wilt be.  
  
[Chorus]  
Great is Thy faithfulness  
Great is Thy faithfulness  
Morning by morning,  
New mercies I see  
All I have needed  
Thy hand has provided  
Great is Thy faithfulness  
Lord unto me  
  
Summer and winter, springtime and harvest  
Sun, moon, and stars in their courses above  
Join with all nature in manifold witness  
To Thy great faithfulness, mercy and love.  
  
[Chorus]

Storms may come, storms may go  
The pain may linger like melting snow  
The wind may toss you  
To and fro but he'll hold you  
Through it all  
  
He'll hold you  
When the tempest rages all around  
He'll hold you  
Plant your feet on solid ground  
He'll hold you  
When the waves come crashing down  
He'll hold you through it all  
  
Hard time will come, rain will pour  
You can't see the road anymore  
You hears been washed up  
Upon life's shore  
But He'll hold you through it all  
  
He'll hold you  
When the tempest rages all around  
He'll hold you  
Plant your feet on solid ground  
He'll hold you  
When the waves come crashing down  
He'll hold you through it all, oh  
  
When you're fallin'  
Hear Him callin', he will come  
In the midst of your storm  
Just hold on tight with all your might  
He will hold you through it all  
  
He'll hold you  
When the tempest rages all around  
He'll hold you  
Plant your feet on solid ground  
He'll hold you  
When the waves come crashing down  
He'll hold you through  
  
He'll hold you  
When the tempest rages all around  
He'll hold you  
Plant your feet on solid ground  
He'll hold you  
When the waves come crashing down  
He'll hold you through it all  
He'll hold you through  
He'll hold you through it all

Why do I feel discouraged  
Why do the shadows come  
And why does my heart feel lonely  
And long for heaven and home  
When Jesus is my portion  
A constant friend is He  
His eye is on the sparrow  
And I know He watches me  
  
So I sing because I'm happy  
And I sing because I'm free  
His eye is on the sparrow  
And I know He watches me  
  
So I sing because I'm happy  
And I sing because I'm free  
His eye is on the sparrow  
And I know He watches  
And I know He watches  
And I know He watches me

If you feel today that you can't make it  
Keep holdin' on, cause you can take it  
If you hold on a little while longer  
Hold on a little while longer  
Hold on a little while longer  
Hold on  
  
If you feel it's raining all in your life  
And day by day, there's nothin'  
Nothin' going right  
Just hold on a little while longer  
Hold on a little while longer  
Hold on a little while longer  
Hold on  
Hold on  
  
You gotta hold to His hand  
God's unchanging hand  
You gotta hold to His hand  
God's unchanging hand  
You gotta build your hopes on things eternal  
My God will never let you down  
  
Weeping may endure for the night  
But if you trust in Jesus  
Everything's gonna be all right  
Just hold on a little while longer  
Hold on a little while longer  
Hold on a little while longer  
Hold on  
Hold on

In the beginning into the darkness  
The spirit's moving upon the water  
You spoke the words, "Let there be light"  
Out of the chaos came the promise  
The universe rose and applauded  
When you commanded the new born sun to rise  
  
You are the day spring you are the morning star  
Creation's splendor speaks of who you are  
You are salvation, you are the joy of the earth  
Restoration comes hope of the broken world  
  
Into my weakness, into my darkness  
Your spirit's moving upon my heart and  
You speak the words, "Let there be light"  
Into my chaos comes your promise  
The new is rising the old is past on  
You are reviving and making all things right  
  
You are the day spring, you are the morning star  
Creation's splendor speaks of who you are  
You are salvation, you are the joy of the earth  
Restoration comes hope of the broken world  
  
Arise shine the glory of the lord has risen  
Arise shine the glory of the lord has risen  
Arise shine the glory of the lord has risen  
Arise shine the glory of the lord has risen  
  
You are the day spring, you are the morning star  
Creation's splendor speaks of who you are  
You are salvation, you are the joy of the earth  
Restoration comes, hope of the broken world  
Restoration come, hope of the broken world

O Lord my God, when I in awesome wonder  
Consider all the worlds thy hands hath made  
I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder  
Thy power throughout the universe displayed  
  
Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee  
How great Thou art, how great Thou art  
Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee  
How great Thou art, how great Thou art!

Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee  
How great Thou art, how great Thou art

How great Thou art, how great Thou art!

In prisoners' chains with bleeding stripes  
Paul and Silas prayed that night  
And in their pain began to sing  
Their chains were loosed and they were free  
I bless Your name, I bless Your name  
I give You honor, give You praise  
You are the Life, the Truth, the Way  
I bless Your name, I bless Your name  
Some midnight hour if you should find  
You're in a prison in your mind  
Reach out and praise, defy those chains  
And they will fall in Jesus' name  
We bless Your name, we bless Your name  
We give You honor, give You praise  
You are the Life, the Truth, the Way  
We bless Your name, we bless Your name  
You are the Life, the Truth, the Way  
We bless Your name, we bless Your name  

As I lay me down,  
Heaven hear me now.  
I'm lost without a cause  
After giving it my all.  
  
Winter storms have come  
And darkened my sun.  
After all that I've been through  
Who on earth can I turn to?  
  
I look to you.  
I look to you.  
After all my strength is gone,  
In you I can be strong  
I look to you.  
I look to you.  
And when melodies are gone,  
In you I hear a song.  
I look to you.  
  
About to lose my breathe,  
There's no more fighting left,  
Sinking to rise no more,  
Searching for that open door.  
  
And every road that I've taken  
Lead to my regret.  
And I don't know if I'm going to make it.  
Nothing to do but lift my head  
  
I look to you.  
I look to you.  
After all my strength is gone,  
In you I can be strong  
I look to you.  
I look to you.  
And when melodies are gone,  
In you I hear a song.  
I look to you.  
  
My levees are broken  
My walls have come  
Tumbling down on me  
  
The rain is falling.  
Defeat is calling.  
I need you to set me free.  
  
Take me far away from the battle.  
I need you.  
Shine on me.  
  
I look to you.  
I look to you.  
After all my strength is gone,  
In you I can be strong  
I look to you.  
I look to you.  
And when melodies are gone,  
In you I hear a song.  
I look to you.

When I'm lost in the rain,  
In your eyes I know I'll find the light to light my way.  
And when I'm scared,  
And losing ground,  
  
When my world is going crazy,  
You can turn it all around.  
And when I'm down you're there - pushing me to the top.  
You're always there, giving me all you've got.  
  
For a shield from the storm,  
For a friend, for a love to keep me safe and warm  
I turn to you.  
For the strength to be strong,  
  
For the will to carry on  
For everything you do, for everything that's true  
I turn to you.  
When I lose the will to win,  
  
I just reach for you and I can reach the sky again.  
I can do anything 'cause your love is so amazing,  
'Cause your love inspires me.  
And when I need a friend,  
  
You're always on my side giving me faith taking me through the night  
For a shield from the storm,  
For a friend, for a love to keep me safe and warm  
I turn to you.  
  
For the strength to be strong,  
For the will to carry on  
For everything you do, for everything that's true  
I turn to you.  
  
For the arms to be my shelter through all the rain,  
For truth that will never change,  
For someone to lean on,  
For a heart I can rely on through anything,  
  
For that one who I can run to  
For a shield from the storm,  
For a friend, for a love to keep me safe and warm  
I turn to you  
  
For the strength to be strong,  
For the will to carry on  
For everything you do, for everything that's true  
I turn to you.  
  
For a shield from the storm,  
For a friend, for a love to keep me safe and warm  
I turn to you.  
For the strength to be strong,  
  
For the will to carry on  
For everything you do, for everything that's true  
I turn to you.  
I turn to you

Will sing of my Redeemer  
He who took the nails for me  
I've been purchased, I've been pardoned  
Bound to Him I'm truly free  
  
I will sing of my Redeemer  
How He sought me while a slave  
Loosed me from the curse of sin and  
From the power of the grave  
  
[Chorus]  
I will sing of my Redeemer  
Lift my voice to praise my Lord  
Ransomed by His blood and mercy  
I am His forevermore  
  
I will sing of my Redeemer  
He who bore my cross, my curse  
Came a servant, chose to suffer  
Lifted up and cast from earth  
  
I will sing of my Redeemer  
Tell about the grace I've known  
Here on earth with those forgiven  
And one day around His throne  
  
[Chorus]

Every breath of air was a silent prayer  
I was longing for your face  
And I wondered why  
All the years went by  
Without a single trace  
  
Anticipating, Lord we've been waiting  
Just watching the days come and go  
But now we know  
  
Joy  
And the angels sang, there was  
Joy  
Let the whole world know this  
Joy  
Our King has finally come  
Joy  
Here is the promised One  
  
Set the captives free  
Tell the broken reed  
Hope has been restored  
And the one who cries  
For the wandering child  
Her tears are not ignored  
  
Father in Heaven  
You gave us reason to see past  
The pain of today  
We Celebrate  
  
Joy  
And the angels sang, there was  
Joy  
Let the whole world know this  
Joy  
Our King has finally come  
Joy  
Here is the promised One  
Joy  
And the angels sing  
Joy  
Let the whole world know this  
Joy  
Our King has finally come  
Joy  
He is the promised One  
  
Unending hope for all time  
When the King of the ages arrived  
  
Joy  
And the angels sang, there was  
Joy  
Let the whole world know this  
Joy  
Our King has finally come  
Joy  
Here is the promised One  
Joy  
And the angels sang, there was  
Joy  
Let the whole world know this  
Joy  
Our King has finally come  
Joy  
Here is the promised One  
  
Joy (let the angels sing)  
Joy (let the angels sing)  
Joy  
  
We've waited so long for this day to come  
The One the Father sent to save us  
We've seen with our own eyes we've seen  
The Promised One  
  
You gave us reason to see past the pain of today  
We've waited so long for this day to come  
We've seen with our own eyes  
The Promised On

Mary, sweet Mary, your heart overflows  
Deep in the night, child, a babe is born.  
Sacred and holy, blameless and pure,  
Mary, sweet Mary, tonight your child is born.  
Mary, sweet Mary, so strong, yet so frail  
Carried a baby sent to save the world.  
Wise men still seek Him and find in Him  
Peace.  
Mary, sweet Mary, tonight your King is born.  
Bridge:  
All of the angels danced as heaven sang  
All of the earth stood so still and so peacefully.

Blessed redemption is found in His eyes.  
All creatures great and small,  
He came for all.  
Mary, sweet Mary, tonight your Savior's born . . .  
Mary, sweet Mary, tonight our Savior is born . . .  

A Child was born on Christmas Day  
Born to save the world  
But long before the world began  
He knew His death was sure  
The pain and strife secured  
  
Mystery, how He came to be a man  
But greater still  
How His death was in His plan  
God predestined that His Son would die  
And He still created man  
Oh, what love is this  
That His death was in His hands  
  
The Christmas trees, they glow so bright  
With presents all around  
But Christmas brought a tree of life  
With blood that sacrificed  
The greatest gift in life  
  
Mystery, how He came to be a man  
But greater still  
How His death was in His plan  
God predestined that His Son would die  
And He still created man  
Oh, what love is this  
That His death was in His hands  
  
I am just a man and can't begin to comprehend  
When You look into these traitor's eyes,  
What do You see that justifies the Lamb  
  
God predestined that His Son would die  
And He still created man  
Oh, what love is this  
That His death was in His hands  
Mystery, mystery

O the deep, deep love of Jesus, vast unmeasured, boundless, free  
Rolling as a mighty ocean, in its fullness over me  
Underneath me, all around me, is the current of Thy love  
Leading onward, leading homeward to Thy glorious rest above  
O the deep, deep love of Jesus, spread His praise from shore to shore  
How He loveth, ever loveth, changeth never, evermore  
How He watches o'er His loved ones, died to call them all His own  
How for them He intercedeth, watcheth o'er them from the throne  
O the deep, deep love of Jesus, 'tis a heav'n of heav'ns to me  
And it lifts me up to glory, for it lifts me up to Thee, yeah  
[Incomprehensible]  
And it lifts me up to glory

Something in your eyes I see  
Reminds me of what used to be  
When I was still uncertain of the truth  
Sleepless nights that turned to days  
Alone inside an endless space  
Counting on someone to see me through  
  
And if there's one thing I know  
It's that you were never left alone  
'Cause you can always on Jesus' name  
And if there's one thing I pray  
  
It's that Jesus helps you find a way  
To make a change and listen to your heart  
God will take away your pain  
If you choose to let it go  
If there's one thing I know  
  
How can I convince your heart?  
His light can find you in the dark  
And only He can make your blind eyes see  
  
For if we speak of lost things found  
Or lives that have been turned around  
Then tell me who knows better child than me  
  
And if there's one thing I know  
It's that you were never left alone  
'Cause you can always on Jesus' name  
And if there's one thing I pray  
  
It's that Jesus helps you find a way  
To make a change and listen to your heart  
God will take away your pain  
If you choose to let it go  
If there's one thing I know  
  
I would never state my life on any lesser thing  
Then the cross of Christ where  
He gave His life to ease my suffering  
  
And if there's one thing I know  
It's that you were never left alone  
'Cause you can always on Jesus' name  
And if there's one thing I pray  
  
It's that Jesus helps you find a way  
To make a change and listen to your heart  
God will take away your pain  
If you choose to let it go  
If there's one thing I know

If you feel today that you can't make it  
Keep holdin' on, cause you can take it  
If you hold on a little while longer  
Hold on a little while longer  
Hold on a little while longer  
Hold on  
  
If you feel it's raining all in your life  
And day by day, there's nothin'  
Nothin' going right  
Just hold on a little while longer  
Hold on a little while longer  
Hold on a little while longer  
Hold on  
Hold on  
  
You gotta hold to His hand  
God's unchanging hand  
You gotta hold to His hand  
God's unchanging hand  
You gotta build your hopes on things eternal  
My God will never let you down  
  
Weeping may endure for the night  
But if you trust in Jesus  
Everything's gonna be all right  
Just hold on a little while longer  
Hold on a little while longer  
Hold on a little while longer  
Hold on  
Hold on

There's a Rose in Bethlehem  
With a beauty quite divine  
Perfect in this world of sin  
On this silent, holy night  
  
There's a fragrance much like hope  
That it sends upon the wind  
Reaching out to every soul  
From a lowly manger's crib  
  
Oh, Rose of Bethlehem  
How lovely, pure, and sweet  
Born to glorify the Father  
Born to wear the thorns for me  
  
There's a Rose in Bethlehem  
Colored red like mercy's blood  
'Tis the flower of our faith  
'Tis the blossom of God's love  
  
Though its bloom is fresh with youth  
Surely what will be He knows  
For a tear of morning dew  
Is rolling down the Rose  
  
Oh, Rose of Bethlehem  
How lovely, pure, and sweet  
Born to glorify the Father  
Born to wear the thorns for me  
  
There's a Rose in Bethlehem  
With a beauty quite divine  
Perfect in this world of sin  
On this silent, holy night  
  
Oh, Rose of Bethlehem  
How lovely, pure, and sweet  
Born to glorify the Father  
Born to wear the thorns for me

Silent night, Holy Night

Sweet Jesus, my Savior  
You are my faithful friend  
You made me, You know me  
And You see my every sin  
  
And my soul is amazed  
By this gift of Your grace  
And these arms that take me in  
  
Sweet Jesus, my Savior  
You are my faithful friend  
  
Sweet Jesus, my shelter  
You are my faithful friend  
The refuge that I run to  
When my world comes closing in  
  
Why should I be afraid  
When I know I am saved  
By the arms that take me in  
  
Sweet Jesus, my shelter  
You are my faithful friend, oh yeah  
  
Sweet Jesus, my shepherd  
You are my faithful friend  
You hold me, You lead me  
I'll follow till the end  
  
And once more I will say  
On that beautiful day  
When Your arms take me in  
  
Sweet Jesus, my shepherd  
You are my faithful friend  
Sweet Jesus, my Savior  
You are my faithful friend

When you know a pretty story  
You don't let it go unsaid  
You tell it to all of your children  
As you tuck them into bed.  
When you know a wonderful secret  
You gotta tell it to all of your friends  
Tell 'em that a lifetime filled with Happiness  
Is like a street that never ends.  
  
Sing that sweet, sweet song of salvation  
And let your laughter fill the air  
Sing that sweet, sweet song of salvation  
And tell the people everywhere.

Tell every man in every nation  
To sing that sweet, sweet song of salvation  
And let the people know that Jesus cares.

As you're singin'  
There are people everywhere  
And to those who stop and listen  
That sweet song becomes a prayer.

There is a fountain filled with blood  
Drawn from Immanuel's veins  
And sinners plunged beneath that flood  
Lose all their guilty stains  
  
Lose all their guilty stains  
Lose all their guilty stains  
And sinners plunged beneath that flood  
Lose all their guilty stains  
The dying thief rejoiced to see  
That fountain in his day  
And there may I, though vile as he  
Wash all my sins away  
  
Away  
Away  
Wash all my sins away  
  
E'er since by faith I saw the stream  
Thy flowing wounds supply  
Redeeming love has been my theme  
And shall be till I die  
  
And shall be till I die  
And shall be till I die  
Redeeming love has been my theme  
And shall be till I die  
  
Wash all my sins away  
Wash all my sins away  
Redeeming love has been my theme  
And shall be till I die

What Child is this who laid to rest  
On Mary's lap is sleeping  
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet  
While shepherds watch are keeping  
  
This, this is Christ the King  
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing  
Haste, Haste to bring Him laud  
The Babe, the Son of Mary  
The Babe, the Son of Mary  
  
Why lies He in such mean estate  
Where ox and ass are feeding  
Good Christian, fear for sinners here  
The silent Word is pleading  
  
This, this is Christ the King  
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing  
Haste, Haste to bring him laud  
The Babe, the Son of Mary  
  
So bring incense, gold, and myrrh  
Come peasant, come king to own Him  
The King of kings salvation brings  
Let loving hearts enthrone Him  
  
Raise, raise, the song on high  
The virgin sings her lullaby  
Joy, Joy for Christ is born  
The Babe, the Son of Mary  
  
This, this is Christ your King  
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing  
Haste, Haste to bring Him laud  
The Babe, the Son of Mary  
  
The Babe, the Son of Mary  
  
Ooh, born in a manger, laid in some hay  
They just didn't know who you were  
Ooh, You were born in a stable, so far away  
O, we just didn't know who You were  
  
Yes, sweet little Jesus, boy  
Sweet little Jesus, boy, oh  
  
Didn't know who, who you were

When I survey the wondrous cross  
On which the Prince of Glory died  
My richest gain I count but loss  
And pour contempt on all my pride  
  
See from His head, His hands, His feet  
Sorrow and love flow mingled down  
Did e'er such love and sorrow meet  
Or thorns compose so rich a crown?  
  
Were the whole realm of nature mine  
That were a present far too small  
Love so amazing, so divine  
Demands my soul, my life, my all

This world is not my home  
Oh, this world is not my home  
My home's been made at heaven's throne  
This world is not my home  
This life is not my own  
Oh, this life is not my own  
I am His and His alone  
This life is not my own  
  
[Chorus]  
I was bought when Love was slain  
What I cost, to pay death's wage  
Now ransomed, I am freedom's slave  
My Jesus raised me from the grave  
  
Come now and walk with me  
Oh, come now and walk with me  
Together we and Lord shall meet  
Come now and walk with me  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Soon Lord, very soon,  
Oh, soon Lord, oh very soon,  
You'll come take me to be with You  
Soon Lord, very soon  
Soon Lord, oh very soon

When I am down and, oh my soul, so weary  
When troubles come and my heart burdened be  
Then, I am still and wait here in the silence  
Until you come and sit awhile with me  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains  
You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas  
I am strong, when I am on your shoulders  
You raise me up, to more than I can be.  
  
There is no life no life without its hunger  
Each restless heart beats so imperfectly  
But when you come and I am filled with wonder  
Sometimes, I think I glimpse eternity  
  
You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains  
You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas  
And I am strong, when I am on your shoulders  
You raise me up, to more than I can be  
You raise me up, to more than I can be
