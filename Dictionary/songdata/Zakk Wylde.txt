This grave of life, I give to you  
Ignore what was, you know it's true  
Realms of fear, they speak the truth  
What has past, I hand to you  
Bleed for me, I've bled for you  
Embrace me, child, I'll see you through  
Bleed for me, I've bled for you  
Embrace me, child, I'll see you through, I'll see you  
I'll dig a hole and bow my head  
To see you smile, I'd face my death  
Realms of fear, they speak the truth  
What has past, I hand to you  
Bleed for me, I've bled for you  
Embrace me, child, I'll see you through  
Bleed for me, I've bled for you  
Embrace me, child, I'll see you through, I'll see you  
Bleed for me, I've bled for you  
Embrace me, child, I'll see you through  
Bleed for me, I've bled for you  
Embrace me, child, I'll see you through, I'll see you  

A little hating in the morning time  
a little hating come around noon  
Ain't no remorse,  
All that you think  
Ain't no regret,  
All that you do  
  
Jesus,  
Hell Yeah, What do we do?  
Jesus,  
Can you hear us screaming up above?  
Lord?  
I guess we were just born to lose  
  
A little hating on my TV screen  
A little hating in the news that I read  
Lay to rest a soul so kind  
Rewarding the wrong  
Feeding The Twisted Mind  
  
You Lookin' At Me  
Forever hurt  
Forever bleed  
It ain't black  
It ain't white  
It ain't wrong  
Lord knows it ain't right  
  
Jesus,  
Hell Yeah, What do we do?  
Jesus,  
Can you hear us screaming up above?  
Lord?  
I guess we were just...  

It's gonna break you, son, it's gonna rot you through  
Forget the past and all you ever knew  
You've never known such fear, you've never shed such tears  
It'll have you wishin' you were never here  
Where have I gone, blacked out on my death ride  
Twisted and broken down, forever on the wrong side  
Where have I gone, blacked out on my death ride  
Twisted and broken down  
All that has been, all that's to be  
No tomorrow, the demise of sanity  
All that has been, all that's to be  
No tomorrow, the demise of sanity  
Straight through the depths of hell, ain't got no soul to sell  
Death on death, the eternal funeral bell  
You've never known such fear, you've never shed such tears  
It'll have you wishin' you were never here  
Where have I gone, blacked out on my death ride  
Twisted and broken down, forever on the wrong side  
Where have I gone, blacked out on my death ride  
Twisted and broken down  
All that has been, all that's to be  
No tomorrow, the demise of sanity  
All that has been, all that's to be  
No tomorrow, the demise of sanity  
Where have I gone, blacked out on my death ride  
Twisted and broken down, forever on the wrong side  
Where have I gone, blacked out on my death ride  
Twisted and broken down  
All that has been, all that's to be  
No tomorrow, the demise of sanity  
All that has been, all that's to be  
No tomorrow, the demise of sanity  
All that has been, all that's to be  
No tomorrow, the demise of sanity  
All that has been, all that's to be

Loaded, stormin' out of control  
Fired up, hell ridin' we roll  
Drinkin' from the well of the damned  
Seize the roads, assault the land  
Respect through fear  
Walkin' tall  
Beyond unreal  
Ohh, always up for the ride  
Ohh, junkies of the genocide  
Risin' always above  
Hell ridin' never enough  
The rush of the chrome to reign supreme  
Pistons of torture, crucifixion of speed  
Respect through fear  
Walkin' tall  
Beyond unreal  
Ohh, always up for the ride  
Ohh, junkies of the genocide  
Ohh, always up for the ride  
Ohh, junkies of the genocide  
Intimidation, degradation  
Loomin' large, desecration  
Bury the old game, worship the insane  
Tomorrow will soon be here  
Immune to fear, the end is never here  
Hell ridin' the gears of life  
Intimidation, degradation  
Loomin' large, desecration  
Ohh, always up for the ride  
Ohh, junkies of the genocide  
Ohh, always up for the ride  
Ohh, junkies of the genocide  

All for you  
Everlasting love forever skies of blue  
All in your heart  
Never ending just a means for start  
  
[Chorus]  
Comfort in your eyes  
For the warmth inside your smile  
Faith's done gone astray  
It was you who made living all worth the while  
I thank you my child  
It was you who made living all worth the while  
I thank you my child  
  
With the touch of your hand  
Amidst confusion I can see enough to understand  
All my fears repressed  
Oh lovin' you child it's the best  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You're all and everything to me  
Til the end of times you know you'll always be  
Ain't no second guess  
Oh you put my worried soul to rest

Woke up early this morning  
As I looked around my world be crumblin' down  
What I saw, I couldn't believe, Who are you?  
What might I be? Oh, the things you do  
  
Stare at the sun, one means three  
At the helm insanity, if you'd look Mama  
Ya just might find but you're too far gone  
Now you're just losin' your mind  
  
Wanting to get away, one more fix you'll be okay  
The things ya do, try and try to talk you down  
You're so damn high, can't hear a sound  
Oh, what's going on?  
  
Once you start, you can't stop, start to shake  
Fall apart, engine's burnin'  
Burnin' out of time, you're too far gone  
Now you're just losin' your mind  
  
Pass through time without a move  
You're the one that's being used  
If you'd look you must might find  
But you're too far gone, now you're just losin' your mind

Without you woman by my side,  
I'm contemplatin' suicide.  
Torn from all my pride.  
Man tells me: "Son, that ain't the way,  
Gonna make a deal with you child,  
Gonna live another day.  
Just sign right here, son, everything'll be alright."  
  
(Ahhhhhhhhhhhhoo)  
Ain't nuthin' I wouldn't do,  
(Ahhhhhhhhhhhhoo)  
All and everything for you,  
(Ahhhhhhhhhhhhoo)  
Your love's all I know and ever knew,  
Therefore, I have sold my soul for you,  
  
I was told by this man it'd be worth my while,  
He'd return me to my woman.  
Return me to my smile.  
It's all I ask for in this life.  
Whatever's wrong son, he told me he'd make right.  
"Just sign right here, child, everything'll be alright."  
  
(Ahhhhhhhhhhhhoo)  
Ain't nuthin' I wouldn't do,  
(Ahhhhhhhhhhhhoo)  
All and everything for you,  
(Ahhhhhhhhhhhhoo)  
Your love's all I know and ever knew,  
Therefore, I have sold my soul for you.  
  
All for you  
  
"Sign right here, son, everything'll be alright."  
  
(Ahhhhhhhhhhhhoo)  
Ain't nuthin' I wouldn't do,  
(Ahhhhhhhhhhhhoo)  
All and everything for you,  
(Ahhhhhhhhhhhhoo)  
Your love's all I know and ever knew,  
Therefore, I have sold my soul for you.

Hunt me down, seek me out, bring your best  
That's how I want it to be  
Full of doubt, full of fear, all's unclear  
It's over 'cause now I can see  
Like a tank, seething strength, crushing all  
Pulling you under my treads  
Lost some years, lost some days, that's okay  
I piss on what's in my way  
Your two-faced abusin'  
Mindless confusion, resolution  
(I feel I'm breathing my first breath)  
Manipulation, dyin' salvation  
You'll never rest  
(You can't kill what's stronger than death)  
Your two-faced abusin'  
Mindless confusion, resolution  
(I feel I'm breathing my first breath)  
Manipulation, dyin' salvation  
You'll never rest  
(You can't kill what's stronger than death)  
Looked inside, found myself, it was me  
Waitin' there at the well  
If you're green, you ain't seen, life's a game  
Sometimes it's just hard to tell  
Gouging eyes, breakin' bones, eatin' flesh  
Puts a smile on my face  
Crawlin' through glass, eatin' nails, losin' blood  
It's all part of findin' your place  
Your two-faced abusin'  
Mindless confusion, resolution  
(I feel I'm breathing my first breath)  
Manipulation, dyin' salvation  
You'll never rest  
(You can't kill what's stronger than death)  
Your two-faced abusin'  
Mindless confusion, resolution  
(I feel I'm breathing my first breath)  
Manipulation, dyin' salvation  
You'll never rest  
(You can't kill what's stronger than death)  
Your two-faced abusin'  
Mindless confusion, resolution  
(I feel I'm breathing my first breath)  
Manipulation, dyin' salvation  
You'll never rest  
(You can't kill what's stronger than death)  
Your two-faced abusin'  
Mindless confusion, resolution  
(I feel I'm breathing my first breath)  
Manipulation, dyin' salvation  
You'll never rest  
(You can't kill what's stronger than death)  

Colour my world all black and blue  
The hell you dish out  
Comes back three-fold to you  
Inside your riddled rotten core  
I hope you get what you deserve  
Worse and even more...  
Even more...  
Even more  
  
[Chorus:]  
[How can you do the things you do?  
You make Satan look like Christ  
I swear its true  
How could you do the things you do?  
How could you do...  
The things you do?]  
  
The Rolling Stones once sang a tune  
Singing words of sympathy  
Yet none were sung for you  
If the lord of darkness seen you comin' his way  
He'd get on his knees  
And look to Jesus...  
Start to pray...  
Start to pray  
  
[Chorus]  
  
More...  
Even more...  
Even more  
  
[Chorus]

I see you across the room  
Search for some happiness ain't anytime soon  
Turmoil has turned you inside  
Sift through your pages of miracles you wish to find  
  
[Chorus]  
When you're too numb to cry  
And you're just left wondering why  
When you're too numb to cry  
And you're just left wondering why  
  
To change in the blink of an eye  
If you could you surely would wave yourself goodbye  
I try and I try and I try  
Get a hold on your suffering  
Peace in which you don't wish to buy

If I could I surely would  
Child ease your pain  
But if I could no longer  
Would you still know my name?  
  
If I couldn't drain the tears  
That pour from these eyes  
Would you turn your back on me  
Would you wave goodbye?  
  
[Chorus]  
Or leave me way beyond empty inside  
Awaiting my last day to arive  
Way beyond empty inside  
Awaiting my end to arrive  
  
If I could be the shoulder  
Which your head would rest upon  
Would you still be waiting (mama)  
Or would you be gone?  
If I couldn't keep the smile  
Forever on your face  
Would I still be around  
Or would I be replaced?  
  
(Yeah)  
Way beyond empty inside  
Awaiting my last day to arive (yeah)  
Way beyond empty inside  
Awaiting my end to arrive  
  
Oh-o  
Oh-o-o-o  
Oh-ooo  
  
(And) Would you promise me  
Things they'd never change  
Could you promise me  
That things they'd stay the same?  
  
If I couldn't clear the clouds  
From over your head  
Would you keep your word to me  
Amongst all the things you said?  
  
Or leave me way beyond empty inside  
Awaiting my last day to arive (yeah)  
Way beyond empty inside  
(oh-o-o)  
Awaiting my end to arrive  
Oh yeah child!

2, 3, 4, 1, drank all my fuckin' brew  
And I ain't got's no more  
Feeling so damn tired  
Running on desperate fumes  
For the end is always near, now  
Empty handed it's always soon  
Psychocise me, terrify me  
Jeopardizing all that's mine  
Megolamize me, certify me  
On my knees until I cry  
Lord only knows where I've gone  
Lord only knows where I've been  
In a world of trouble again worries  
Streaming 'round the bend  
Treat me like a dog, now  
Knowing I won't turn  
Blind me like a slave, now  
Cast down no concern
