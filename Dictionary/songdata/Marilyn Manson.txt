We are damned and we are dead  
All God's children to be sent  
To our perfect place in the sun  
And in the dirt  
  
There's a windshield in my heart  
We are bugs so smeared and scarred  
And could you stop the meat from thinking  
Before I swallow all of it  
Could you please?  
  
Put me in the motorcade  
Put me in the death parade  
Dress me up and take me  
Dress me up and make me your dying god  
  
Angels with needles poke through our eyes  
And let the ugly light of the world in  
We were no longer blind  
We were no longer blind  
  
Put me in the motorcade  
Put me in the death parade  
Dress me up and take me  
Dress me up and make me your dying God  
  
Now we hold the "ugly head"  
The Mary-whore is at the bed  
They've cast the shadow of our perfect death  
In the sun and in the dirt  

A Rose and a Baby Ruth  
Doo, doo, doo, doo  
Doo, doo, doo, doo  
  
We had a quarrel  
A teenage quarrel  
Now I'm as blue as I know how to be  
I can't call you on the phone  
I can't even see you at your home  
  
So I'm sending you this present  
Just to prove that I'm telling the truth  
Dear, I believe you won't laugh when you receive  
This rose and a Baby Ruth  
  
Doo, doo, doo, doo  
Doo, doo, doo, doo  
Doo, doo, doo, doo, ahh  
  
I could have sent you an orchid of some kind  
But that's all I had in my jeans at the time  
  
But when we grow up  
Some day I'll show up  
Just to prove I was telling the truth  
I'll kiss you too then I'll hand to you  
This rose and a Baby Ruth  
  
Doo, doo, doo, doo  
Doo, doo, doo, doo  
Doo, doo, doo, doo

He is the angel with the scabbed wings  
Hard drug face want to powder his nose  
He will deflower the freshest crop  
Dry up all the wounds with his rock and roll sores  
Dead  
Is what he is he does what he please  
The things that he has you'll never want to see  
What you're never gonna be now  
Sketch a little keyhole for looking glass people  
You don't want to see him  
You only want to be him  
Mommy's got a scarecrow, gotta let the corn grow  
Man can't always reap what he sow  
"he is the maker"  
(he is the taker)  
"he is the saviour"  
(he is the raper)  
  
Get back you're never gonna leave him  
Get back you're always gonna please him

You built me up with your wishing hell

You threw your money in the pissing well  
You do just what they tell you  
REPENT that's what I'm talking about

REPENT that's what I'm talking about  
Whose mistake am I anyway?  
Cut the head off  
Grows back hard  
I am the hydra  
Now you'll see your star  
Prick your finger it is done  
The moon has now eclipsed the sun  
The angel has spread it's wings  
The time has come for bitter things  
REPENT that's what I'm talking about  
I she'd the skin to feed the fake  
REPENT that's what I'm talking about  
Whose mistake am I anyway?  
Cut the head off  
Grows back hard

The time has come it is quite clear  
Our antichrist  
Is almost here  
Cut the head off  
Grows back hard  
I am the hydra  
Now you'll see your star

Eternity is now or never  
  
I've been waiting for a long time, baby  
I've been waiting for the world to  
  
Burn the churches!  
Burn the banks!  
Burn the precincts!  
Burn City Hall!  
Burn the Court House!  
Burn the schools!

You build a road to nowhere  
Mile after mile  
The future isn't going anywhere

They wanna sell it out, buy it up  
And dumb it down  
A good god is hard to find  
I'll join the crowd that wants to see me dead  
Right now I feel I belong for the first time  
Multiply your death, divide by sex  
Add up the violence and what do you get?  
We are all just stars and we're waiting  
We are all just scarred and we're hating  
We are all just stars on your burning flag  
  
You can point your gun at me  
And hope it will go away  
But if God was alive  
He would hate you anyway  
  
My right wing is flapping  
The left wing is grey  
Let's hear it for the kids but nothing they say  
They gyrate and G-rate on Election Day  
We got our ABC's and our F-U-C-K  
F-U-C-K  
F-U-C-K  
  
Multiply your death, divide by sex  
Add up the violence and what do you get?

I am the god of fuck! I am the god of fuck!  
Virgins sold in quantity herded by heredity  
Red neck burn out mid west mind "who said date rape isn't kind?"  
Porno nation evaluation  
What's this "time for segregation"  
libido libido fascination too much oral defacation  
White trash get down on your knees time for cake and sodomy  
White trash get down on your knees time for cake and sodomy  
VCR's and vaseline, tv-fucked by plastic queens  
Cash in hand and dick on screen, who said God was ever clean?  
Bible-belt 'round anglo-waste, putting sinners in their place  
Yeah, right, great if you're so good explain the shit stains on your face

Choklit Factory  
There was strange was a man there, I think he was the Tinker  
He was standing right behind me looking up at the factory  
Just before he left he said  
"Nobody every goes in, and nobody every comes out"  
  
Where's the choklit? Where's the choklit? Where's the choklit?  
One boy entertained by  
The torments of another soul  
Touching was confusing  
And he found he was all alone  
  
He sought salvation  
In the darkness of the choklit  
Sweets soaked insecurities  
And sugar teased his need to kill  
Peel back, the faces  
We hide within our choklit shell  
Some know indulgence  
Some know and some go much too far  
  
Where's the-where's the choklit?  
They came hypnotized by  
The promise in his somber grin  
He saw s-s-s-something  
In the weakness of their skin  
Peel back, the faces  
We hide within our choklit shell  
Some know indulgence  
Some know and some go much too far  
Little suprises around every corner but nothing too dangerous  
  
Is it raining is it snowing?  
Is a hurricane a blowing?  
Not a speck of light is showing  
So the danger must be growing  
Are the fires of hell a glowing?  
Is the grizzly reaper mowing?  
Yes the danger must be growing  
For the rowers keep on rowing  
Not showing signs of slowing  
Any sign that they are slowing  
Faster faster faster faster  
Faster faster faster faster  
Faster faster faster faster  
Faster faster faster faster  
  
Jeff saved for later  
His prizes of iniquity  
Polaroids to covet  
And bones to hide in 213  
Peel back, the faces  
We hide within our choklit shell  
Some know indulgence  
Some know and some go...

My mouth was a crib, and it was growing lies  
I didn't know what love was on that day  
My heart's a tiny bloodclot, I picked at it  
It never heals, it never goes away  
  
Burned all the good things in the eden eye  
We were too dumb to run, too dead to die(2x)  
  
This was never my world, you took the angel away  
I killed myself to make everybody pay(2x)  
  
I would have told her that she was the only thing  
that I could love in this dying world  
But the simple word of love itself  
already died and went away  
  
This was never my world, you took the angel away  
I killed myself to make everybody pay(2x)  
  
Burned all the good things in the eden eye  
We were too dumb to run, too dead to die(2x)  
  
This was never my world, you took the angel away  
I killed myself to make everybody pay(4x)  
  
Her heart's a bloodstained egg  
We didn't handle with care  
It's broken and bleeding  
and we can never repair(2x)  
  
and we can never repair

Each time I make my mother cry  
An angel dies and falls from heaven  
When the boy is still a worm it's hard to  
Learn the number seven  
But when they get to you  
It's the first thing that they do  
Each time I look outside  
My mother dies I feel my back is changing shape  
When the worm consumes the boy it's never  
Considered rape  
When they get to you  
Prick your finger it is done  
The moon has now eclipsed the sun  
The angel has spread its wings  
The time has come for bitter things

Manson:...you're gonna have a bunch of angry kids.  
Some Guy In the Audience: Well when you do go out to a club, that, you just  
Gotta watch yourself whatever you do. You just can't 'speckt to go out there  
And just dance and don't get touched and non-violent because that's what it
is.  
The music--  
Donahue: I, I don't see how you--  
Some Guy In the Audience: If you get the music inside your soul, anything can  
Happen. You don't play the music, you can't get it. It's the music.  
Donahue: The music?  
Parent: Music is dangerous.  
  
Concerned Citizen: My sympathy for the parents...

Stare in the face of the grim death  
Screaming monsters bring me to deafness  
My dagger and swagger are useless in the faze of the mirror  
When the mirror is made of my face

This is the house of death  
Where even angels die in arms of daemons  
This is the house of death  
Where even angels die in arms from a daemon... S

Hide yo heart in yo gut  
But for what? When they're waiting to pull you apart like a scarecrow  
On death row, soon now all of your secrets are shown  
  
[Chorus:]  
This is the house of death  
Where even angels die in arms of daemons  
This is the house of death  
Where even angels die in arms from a daemon... S

Rewrite the consitution.  
Let's justify the revolution.  
The end is here.  
  
If you're a part of the institution.  
You're not a part of the solution.  
Bow down to fear.

The only good god is a dead god.  
The only god good for me.  
The only good god is a dead god, baby.  
The only damn god I need.  
  
Don't draw your own conclusion.  
Submit to the grand illusion.  
Get on your knees.  
  
There will be no absolution.  
No final step of evolution.  
The end is near.  
  
I, I, I am the president.  
I, I, the emperor.  
I, I, I am the king of the world.

The only god good for me.  
The only good god is a dead god, baby.  
The only damn god I need.  
  
Your world means nothing to me.  
Your saviors a fool still in your dreams.  
And when you're wrapped in your blame,  
Fullfill your own prophecy.  
No skin off my teeth.  
  
The only good god is a dead god.  
The only god good for me.  
The only good god is a dead god, baby.  
The only damn god I need.  
  
The only good god is a dead god.  
The only god good for me.  
The only good god is a dead god, baby.  
The only fucking god I need.  
  
I killed your king of deceit.  
Chaos come onto me.  
I am free.  
And when you're ultimately,  
Consumed by your own fucking greed.  
You will see.

You wanna know what Zeus said to Narcissus  
You'd betta watch yourself

You'd better watch yourself

Yeah  
  
It's like a stranger had a key, came inside of my mind  
And moved all my things around  
He didn't know snakes can hear the prey  
Can't try to break the psyche down  
  
Yeah  
  
It's in my half frozen wax  
And your artillery lead

Deep 6, 6, 6 feet deep  
  
It's like a stranger had a key, came inside of my mind  
And moved all my things around  
He didn't know snakes can hear the prey  
Can't try to break my psyche down  
  
It's in my half frozen wax  
And your artillery lead  
Do ya like our plan

When you wish upon a star  
Don't let yourself fall fall in too hard  
I fell into you and I'm on my back  
An insect decaying in your little trap  
I squirm into you now I'm in your gut  
I fell into you now I'm in a rut  
"I lift you up like the sweetest angel  
I'll tear you down like a whore.  
I will bury your god in my warm spit  
You'll be deformed in your porn"  
Rock star yeah (you're such a dirty, dirty)  
Rock star, yeah (dirty, dirty, dirty)  
You eat up my heart and all the little parts  
Your star is so sharp  
It leaves me jagged holes  
I make myself sick just to poison you  
If I can't have you then no one will  
  
You are the one I want and what I want is so unreal  
I'm such a dirty Rock star yeah  
(I am the one you want and the one you want is so unreal)

I'll swallow up all of you  
Like a big bottle of big, big pills  
You're the one that I should never take  
But I can't sleep until I devour you  
I can't sleep until I devour you  
You're a flower that's withering  
I can't feel your thorns in my head  
  
This is no impressionability  
You're not crying, this is blood all over me  
You're not crying, this is blood all over me  
You're not crying, this is blood all over me  
And I'll love you, if you let me  
And I'll love you, if you won't make me starve  
  
I used to hold your heart to neck  
I know I'll miss you if I close my eyes  
But this is loaded with an open film  
I'll see you and I'll blow your heart to pieces  
I will blow your heart to pieces  
I will blow your heart to pieces  
I will blow your heart to pieces  
And I'll love you, if you let me  
And I'll love you, if you won't make me starve  
Oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh  
  
My pain's not ashamed to repeat itself  
Pain's not ashamed to repeat itself  
Pain's not ashamed to repeat itself  
Pain's not ashamed to repeat itself  
I can't sleep until I devour you  
I can't sleep until I devour you  
I can't sleep until I devour you  
I can't sleep until I devour you  
I can't sleep until I devour you  
And I'll love you, if you let me  
And I'll love you, if you won't make me starve

America bled to death,  
Electric and pregnant,  
Brilliant sluts and fire worship,  
Devouring the righteous,  
We were just monkeys braiding thread,  
We were golden needles,  
Diamonds and pollen...  
  
Then Coma White,  
A mannequeen of depression,  
With the face of a dead star,  
Fagged out for the corner,  
She was so soft in her death,  
And the pomegranate Earth,  
Spins into oblivion,  
  
The one that trembles,  
The one that fears,  
The one that suffers,  
The one that vomits,  
The one that needs,  
  
A million scars,  
A million promises,  
  
And all your sad endings,  
Are planting in their gardens,  
And their waiting to grow,  
And to die like flowers too,  
And all your sad endings,  
Are planting in their gardens,  
And their waiting to grow,  
And to die like flowers to...

Burn the witches, burn the witches, don't take time to sew your stiches  
Burn the witches, burn the witches  
Good is the thing that you favor, evil is your sour flavor  
You cannot sedate all the things you hate  
  
Burn your bridges, burn your bridges, don't take time to sew your stiches  
Burn your bridges, burn your bridges  
Good is the thing that you favor, evil is your sour flavor  
I don't need your hate, I decide my fate  
  
You cannot sedate all the things you rape

An extra mile across the line, I kiss my Judas one more time  
I die for your sin  
Life is simple, life is sweet  
The perspective from down on your knees will kill you from within  
Fortune and fame, torture and shame  
Think twice before you speak  
Glory and blame, it's all the same  
My game is your defeat  
[Chorus:]: Don't pray for me  
I don't need your sympathy  
I don't want your god protecting me  
Don't pray for me  
I don't want your empathy  
I don't need your savior saving me  
Don't pray for me  
I don't care what book you quote  
Your poison is my antidote  
I don't burn and I don't bleed  
Wrap that guilt up deep inside  
Religion has an alibi  
What more could you need  
Fortune and fame, torture and shame  
You still don't understand  
Glory and blame, it's all the same  
Some things go hand in hand  
[Chorus:]: Don't pray for me  
I don't need your sympathy  
I don't want your god protecting me  
Don't pray for me  
I don't want your empathy  
I don't need your savior saving me  
Don't pray for me  
Sacrifice the innocence  
Will you illiminate the decadance  
You celebrate the enemy  
We'll blind your eyes and steal your dreams  
[Chorus:]: Don't pray for me  
I don't need your sympathy  
I don't want your god protecting me  
Don't pray for me  
I don't want your empathy  
I don't need your savior saving me  
Don't pray for me

I peek into the hole I struggle for control  
  
The children love the show but they fail to see the anguish in my  
  
eyes  
  
Fail to see the anguish in my eyes  
  
I scratch around the brim I let my mind give in  
  
The crowd begins to grin but they seem to scream when darkness fills  
  
my eyes  
  
Seem to scream when darkness fills my eyes it's no surprise  
  
Fail to see the tragic turn it into magic  
  
My big top tricks will always make you happy  
  
But we all know the hat is wearing me  
  
My bag is in the hat, it's filled with this and that  
  
My vision's getting fat, the rabbit's just a monkey in disguise  
  
Stars and pills and needles dance before our eyes  
  
They will bite the hand if it is slower than the quickness of their  
  
scrutinizing eyes  
  
Fail to see the tragic, turn it into magic  
  
My big top tricks will always make you happy  
  
But we all know the hat is wearing me  
  
Chicanery will always make you happy  
  
But we all know the hat is wearing me

Dune Buggy  
They'd mount machine guns on top of the dune buggies  
And the girls would drive the dune buggy while the guys shot the machine gun  
We'd swoop down on the town and kill everyone that wasn't beautiful  
  
Take it out take it out  
Take it out take it out  
Take it out  
Dog god, bites my face  
Rip it out by the roots  
Rip it out by the roots  
From my skull  
Goddamn toilet washes me away  
Cuze I am the Choklit Cow  
Choklit Cow  
Ask forgiveness and  
I'll show you how  
Choklit Cow  
Choklit Cow  
Ask forgiveness and  
I'll show you how  
  
Trippin this trippin this  
Trippin this trippin this  
Trippin that  
Smile like, a cheshire cat  
Get it out get it out  
Get it out get it out  
Get it out of your skull  
You're just a doll  
I make sometimes to play  
  
Take me down now  
Hole in the ground  
The little girls think  
That I'm so sweet  
Mocked up and down  
Heart like a ghost town  
Spirits of the world  
Cower at my feet  
  
Take it out take it out  
Take it out take it out  
Take it out  
Dog god, bites my face  
Rip it out by the roots  
Rip it out by the roots  
Rip it out  
Goddamn toilet washes me away  
Cuze I am the Choklit Cow  
Choklit Cow  
Ask forgiveness and  
I'll show you how  
Choklit Cow  
Choklit Cow  
Ask forgiveness and  
I'll show you how  
  
I am the Choklit Cow  
Ask forgiveness and  
I'll show you how  
I am the Choklit Cow  
Ask forgiveness and  
I'll show you how

In the wasteland on the way to the Red Queen  
It's no wonder our stage clothes have dreams to be famous  
The trees in the courtyard are painted in blood, so I've heard  
She hangs the headless upside down to drain  
  
Eat me, drink me  
Eat me, drink me  
This is only a game  
This is only a game  
  
I was invited to a beheading today  
I thought I was a butterfly next to your flame  
A rush of panic and the lock has been raped  
This is only a game  
This is only a game  
  
But then our star rushes in, feeling like a child and looking like a woman  
She's been forecast with an attempt to kill herself  
But the ending didn't test well

Eat me, drink me  
This is only a game

And now I'm picking my skin and my scales  
I see my horror mirrored in your sundown of a blank stare  
I see my horror mirrored in your sundown of a blank stare  
  
Then our star rushes in, feeling like a child and looking like a woman

Epilogue  
Go home to your mother!  
Doesn't she ever watch you?  
Tell her this isn't some communist day care center  
Tell your mother I hate her  
Tell your mother I hate you!  
  
(12: 40)  
I want my son off of your mailing list  
I have already contacted the post office for your pornographic material that  
Has been received in the mail  
My next stop is my attorney  
I do not want this number called anymore and I do not want anything delivered  
To my address  
If I receive anything else from this band or this group, my next phone call  
Will be my attorney and you will be contacted  
Thank you and good bye

Speak to the sinners  
Is it a crime for  
Stopping the innocent  
Rotting all away  
Rotting all away  
  
Have you forgotten  
All that I live for  
Hardened forever  
You will always be the same  
Always be the same  
  
Every time I close my eyes  
Angels visit me and feed me lies (time)  
To the end of my life  
I'll ask you why, why why  
Tell me why  
  
You miss somebody  
Is it the same for  
Sorry for everything  
I thought I'd given you  
Thought I'd given you  
  
Trapped in the cavern  
Is it a shame for  
Endlessly searching  
For the force behind the wall  
The force behind the wall  
  
(I.. Cant)  
  
Every time I close my eyes  
Angels visit me and feed me lies (time)  
To the end of my life  
I'll ask you why, why why  
Tell me why  
  
(My, Friend, This is what you...)

You have eyes that lead me on  
And a body that shows me death  
Your lips look like they were made  
For something else, but they just suck my breath  
I want your pain to taste why you're ashamed  
And I know you're not just what you say to me  
And I'm not the only moment you're made of  
  
[Chorus:]  
You're so sudden and sweet on your legs, knockin' knees  
Head's blown clean off, your mouth paid off  
Fuck me till we know it's unsafe  
And we'll paint over the evidence  
  
Want you wanting me  
Want what I see in your eyes  
So give me something to be scared of  
Don't give me something to satisfy  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I want your pain to taste why you're ashamed  
And I know you're not just what you say to me  
And I'm not the only moment you're made of  
  
[Chorus x 2]

I lie, I wait  
I stop, I hesitate  
I am, I breathe  
I meant, I think of me  
  
Is it any wonder I can't sleep?  
All I have is all you gave to me  
Is it any wonder I found peace through you?  
Turn to the gates of heaven, to myself be damned  
Turn away from light  
It's not enough, just a touch  
It's not enough  
  
I taste, I love  
I come, I bleed enough  
I hate, I'm not  
I was, I want too much  
  
Is it any wonder I can't sleep?  
All I have is all you gave to me  
Is it any wonder I found peace through you?  
Turn to the gates of heaven, to myself be damned  
Turn away from light  
It's not enough, just a touch  
It's not enough, just a touch  
It's not enough, just a touch  
It's not enough, just a touch  
It's not enough, just a touch  
It's not enough, just a touch

[Verse:]  
I don't know if I can open up  
I've been opened enough  
I don't know if I can open up  
I'm not a birthday present  
I'm aggressive regressive  
The past is over  
And passive scenes so pathetic  
  
[Pre-Chorus:]  
I was fated, faithful, fatal  
I was fated, faithful, fatal  
  
[Chorus:]  
I feel stoned and alone like a heretic  
Ready to meet my maker  
I feel stoned and alone like a heretic  
I'm ready to meet my maker  
Lazarus has got no dirt on me  
Lazarus has got no dirt on me  
And I'll rise every occasion  
I'm the Mephistopheles of Los Angeles  
Of Los Angeles  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Don't know if I can open up  
I been opened too much  
Double cross glossed over in my path-os  
  
[Pre-Chorus:]  
I was fated, faithful, fatal  
I was fated, faithful, fatal  
  
[Chorus:]  
I feel stoned and alone like a heretic  
Ready to meet my maker  
I feel stoned and alone like a heretic  
I'm ready to meet my maker  
Lazarus has got no dirt on me  
Lazarus has got no dirt on me  
And I'll rise every occasion  
I'm the Mephistopheles of Los Angeles  
Of Los Angeles  
  
[Bridge:]  
I was fated, faithful, fatal  
I was fated, faithful, fatal  
I feel stoned and alone like a heretic  
And I'm ready to meet my maker  
I feel stoned and alone like a heretic  
And I'm ready to meet my maker  
  
[Chorus:]  
I feel stoned and alone like a heretic  
Ready to meet my maker  
I feel stoned and alone like a heretic  
I'm ready to meet my maker  
Lazarus has got no dirt on me  
Lazarus has got no dirt on me  
And I'll rise every occasion  
I'm the Mephistopheles of Los Angeles  
Of Los Angeles

The bitter taste of rotten fruit is vomit in the mouth  
The taste is sour and is spit upon the ground  
And left to rot, decay and spoil  
Rotten apple forbidden fruit  
Rotten apple forbidden fruit  
  
Repent!!  
Repent!!  
  
Watch the insects eat the rotten apples on the ground  
Watch the insects eat the rotten apples on the ground  
Watch the insects eat the rotten apples on the ground  
Watch the insects eat the rotten apples on the ground  
  
Repent!!  
Repent!!  
  
Watch the insects eat the rotten apples on the ground  
Watch the insects eat the rotten apples on the ground  
Watch the insects eat the rotten apples on the ground  
Watch the insects eat the rotten apples on the ground!  
  
Repent!!  
  
Repent...

Who'll ride this dying carousel?  
Four rusting horses strangled by their own rope  
What children love a singing wheel  
Now that their tight hearts it broke  
That their tight hearts it broke  
  
Everyone will come, everyone will come to my funeral  
To make sure that I stay dead  
Everyone will come, everyone will come to my funeral  
To make sure that I stay dead  
  
I can see the coffin shining through my tinted window  
Must've missed the sign that said it was a fire sale  
I can see the coffin shining through my tinted window  
Must've missed the sign that said it was a fire sale  
  
Everyone will come, everyone will come to my funeral  
To make sure that I stay dead  
Everyone will come, everyone will come to my funeral  
To make sure that I stay dead  
  
You can't take this from me  
(forbidden in Heaven and useless in Hell)  
You can't take this from me  
(forbidden in Heaven and useless in Hell)  
Useless in Hell  
  
I can see the coffin shining through my tinted window  
Must've missed the sign that said it was a fire sale  
I can see the coffin shining through my tinted window  
Must've missed the sign that said it was a fire sale  
  
Everyone will come, everyone will come to my funeral

Who'll ride this dying carousel?  
Four rusted horses strangled by their own rope  
What children love a singing wheel  
Now that their tight hearts it broke  
That their tight hearts it broke

And I want to wake up in your  
White, white sun  
And I want to wake up in your world  
With no pain  
But I'll just suffer in a hope to die someday  
While you are numb all of the way  
When I hate it's  
I know, I can feel here  
But when you love, you know it's not real  
No  
When I hate it's  
I know, I can feel here  
But when you love, you know it's not real  
Now I am resigned  
Wicked fuckin' worlds  
On its way to Hell  
Livin' are dead and  
I hope to join them too  
I know what to do? And I do it well  
When I hate it's  
I know, I can feel here  
But when you love, you know it's not real  
No  
When I hate it's  
I know, I can feel here  
But when you love, you know it's not real  
Shootin' myself to love you  
If I loved myself, I'd been shootin' you  
(Haa, haa, haa, haa)  
Oh yeah  
Shootin' myself to love you  
If I loved myself, I'd been shootin' you  
(Haa, haa, haa, haa)  
Yeah  
Shootin' myself to love you  
If I loved myself, I'd been shootin' you

Some men need some killer weed, some men need cocaine  
Some men need some cactus juice, to purify the brain  
Some men need two women, some need alcohol  
Everybody needs a little something, but Lord I need it all  
  
To get my rocks off, get my rocks off  
Get my rocks off the mountain, and roll 'em on down the hill  
  
I may do you one time, and I may do you more  
I may turn you into something, that you ain't ready for  
I might want your body, and I might want your bread  
I might want your momma to come visit me instead  
  
And get my rocks off, get my rocks off  
Get my rocks off the mountain, and roll 'em on down the hill  
  
Sometimes I dream of chicks, to bring me ever lasting joys  
Sometimes I dream of animals, sometimes I dream of boys  
Sometimes I kill the living, sometimes I raise the dead  
Sometimes I say just screw it all, and crawl back into bed  
  
And get my rocks off, get my rocks off  
Get my rocks off the mountain, and roll 'em on down the hill

Goddamn your righteous hand  
I eat innocent meat  
The housewife I will beat  
The prolife I will kill  
What you won't do I will  
I bash myself to sleep  
What you sow I will reap  
I scar myself you see  
I wish I wasn't me  
I am the little stick  
You stir me into shit  
I hate the fool I am  
Goddamn your righteous hand  
Goddamn, goddamn (oh, lord)  
Goddamn, goddamn  
Pseudo-morals work real well  
On the talk shows for the weak  
But your selective judgements  
And goodguy badges  
Don't mean a fuck to me  
I throw a little fit  
I slit my teenage wrist  
The most that I can learn  
Is in records that you burn  
Get your gunn, get your gunn  
Get your gunn, get your gunn  
Pseudo-morals work real well  
On the talk shows for the weak  
But your selective judgements  
And goodguy badges  
Don't mean a fuck to me  
I am the vhs  
Record me with your fist  
You want me to save the world  
I'm just a little girl  
Pseudo-morals work real well  
On the talk shows for the weak  
But your selective judgements  
And goodguy badges  
Don't mean a fuck to me  
Get your gunn, get your gunn  
Get your gunn, get your gunn... Get

Dear god do you want to tear your knuckles down  
And hold yourself  
Dear god do you want to climb of that tree  
Meat in the shape of a 'T'  
Dear god the paper says you were the King  
In the black limousine  
Dear John and all the King's men  
Can't put your head together again  
  
Before the bullets  
Before the flies  
Before authorities take out my eyes  
The only smiling are you dolls that I made  
But you are plastic and so are your brains  
  
Dear god the sky is as blue  
As a gunshot wound  
Dear god if you were alive  
You know we'd kill you  
  
Before the bullets  
Before the flies  
Before authorities take out my eyes  
The only smiling are you dolls that I made  
But you are plastic and so are your brains  

In space the stars are no nearer  
They just glitter like a morgue  
And I dreamed I was a spaceman  
Burned like a moth in a flame  
And our world was so fucking gone  
  
But I'm not attached to your world  
Nothing heals and nothing grows  
  
Because it's a great big white world  
And we are drained of our colors  
We used to love ourselves,  
We used to love one another  
All my stitches itch  
My prescriptions low, I wish you  
Were queen  
Just for today  
In a world so white what else could I say?  
  
And hell was so cold  
All the vases are so broken  
And the roses tear our hands all open  
Mother Mary miscarry  
But we pray just like insects  
The world is so ugly now  
  
Because it's a great big white world  
And we are drained of our colors  
We used to love ourselves,  
We used to love one another  
All my stitches itch  
My prescriptions low, I wish you  
Were queen  
Just for today  
In a world so white what else could I say?

Living easy, living free  
Season ticket on a one-way ride  
Asking nothing, leave me be  
Taking everything in my stride  
Don't need reason, don't need rhyme  
Ain't nothing I would rather do  
Going down, party time  
My friends are gonna be there too  
I'm on the highway to hell  
No stop signs, speed limit  
Nobody's gonna slow me down  
Like a wheel, gonna spin it  
Nobody's gonna mess me round  
Hey Satan, payed my dues  
Playing in a rocking band  
Hey Momma, look at me  
I'm on my way to the promised land  
I'm on the highway to hell  
(Don't stop me)  
And I'm going down, all the way down  
I'm on the highway to hell

You are the wind beneath my wings.  
The grill across my face.  
You are the fuel in my machine.  
That special place.  
  
You are the sunshine of my life.  
My first and only love.  
You are the apple of my eye.  
You suck my blood.  
  
And I Hate you more than life itself.  
I even hate you more than i hate myself.  
  
I hate, therefor I am.  
I am, therefor I hate.  
  
Another nail in my coffin.  
Another thorn in my side.  
Another gun to my temple.  
(Goodbye...goodbye)  
  
And I Hate you more than life itself.  
I even hate you more than i hate myself.  
  
I hate, therefor I am.  
I am, therefor I hate.  
  
You are the final destination.  
The calm before the storm.  
You are the worm within my own self.  
I died when you were born.  
  
(I died when you were born)  
  
And I Hate you more than life itself.  
I even hate you more than i hate myself.  
I Hate you more than life itself.  
I even hate you more than i hate myself.

I put a spell on you  
Because you're mine.  
I can't stand the things that you do.  
No, no, no, I ain't lyin'. No.  
I don't care if you don't want me  
'Cause I'm yours, yours, yours anyhow.  
Yeah, I'm yours, yours, yours.  
I love you. I love you.  
[Repeat Three Times]  
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!  
Yeah....  
I put a spell on you.  
Lord! Lord! Lord!  
.... 'Cause you're mine, yeah.  
I can't stand the things that you do  
When you're foolin' around.  
I don't care if you don't want me.  
'Cause I'm yours, yours, yours anyhow.  
Yeah, yours, yours, yours!  
I can't stand your foolin' around.  
If I can't have you,  
No one will!  
I love you, you, you!  
I love you. I love you. I love you!  
I love you, you, you!  
I don't care if you don't want me.  
'Cause I'm yours, yours, yours anyhow.

Look at me now  
Got no religion  
Look at me now  
I'm so vacant  
  
Look at me now  
I was a virgin  
Look at me now  
Grew up to be a whore  
  
And I want it  
I believe it  
I'm a million different things  
And not one you know  
  
Hey and our mommies are lost now  
Hey, daddy's someone else  
Hey, we love the abuse  
Because it makes us feel like we are needed now  
  
But I know  
I want to disappear  
  
I want to die young  
And sell my soul  
Use up all your drugs  
And make me come  
  
Yesterday man,  
I was a nihilist and  
Now today I'm  
Just too fucking bored  
  
By the time I'm old enough  
I won't know anything at all  
  
Hey and our mommies are lost now  
Hey, daddy's someone else  
Hey, we love the abuse  
Because it makes us feel like we are needed now  
  
But I know  
I want to disappear

I'm squirming slow now  
Sticking in it  
Swallow in your warm spit  
Repel, rip  
  
What'ca ya gonna feel?  
Never gonna heal  
See what's in my blood  
What'ca ya gonna feel?  
Never gonna heal  
See what's in my blood  
What'ca ya gonna feel?  
Never gonna heal  
See what's in my blood  
What'ca ya gonna feel?  
Never gonna heal  
  
Stuck and displaced  
It will drown again  
Stuck and disappeared  
Now you gonna see, now you gonna see  
Now you gonna see what's in my blood  
  
Sticking in it  
Sticking in it  
Sticking in it  
Sticking in it

Black Sun came and changed our name  
Made our lives this simple stain  
Drove the children from their chores  
Handcrafted housewives into whores  
  
Society snake it ate our brains  
Injected poison in our veins  
T. V. Minds hip swing grinds  
Faces cracked and filled with lines  
Black sun came and changed our name  
Made our lives this simple stain  
  
Introveneous T. V. Feeds  
Bedroom violence all he sees  
Ride the lightning to the sky  
Stab the clouds and watch them cry  
Black sun came and changed our name  
Made our lives this simple stain  
  
All we do is smite  
For what we think is right  
Sound of mind bereft of sight  
Denial taking human life  
  
Clouds go by children run  
Gulls do nosedives in the sun  
Water falling from a spout  
Into wanting thirsty mouths  
  
Black sun came and changed out name  
Made our lives this simple stain  
Made our lives this simple stain

Endless blinding cathode light

Love is a fire  
Burns down all that it sees  
Burns down everything  
Everything you think burnt down  
Everything you say  
  
She blew me her death-kiss and the mouth-marks bled down my eyes  
Like her dying on my windshield, I can already feel her worms eating my spine  
So how can it be this lonely?  
Is this all we get for our lives? Is love only sweeter when one of us dies?  
  
Then I knew that our love was just a car crash away  
I knew that our love was just a car crash away  
I knew that our love was just a car crash away  
I knew that our love was just a car crash away  
  
Love is a fire  
Burns down all that it sees  
Burns down everything  
Everything you think burns down

Everything you think burns down  
Everything you say  
Love is a fire  
Burns down all that it sees  
Burns down everything  
Everything you think burns down  
Everything you say  
  
I knew that our love was just a car crash away  
Knew that our love was just a car crash away, just a car crash away  
  
Everything you think

Everything you think burns down  
Everything you say  
  
Love is a fire  
Burns down all that it sees  
Burns down everything  
Everything you think burns down

Cuz we got guns, we got guns, we got guns (we got guns)

He lives inside my mouth  
And tells me what to say  
When he turns the trains  
On he makes it go away  
The hands are cracked and dirty and  
The nails are beetle wings  
When he turns the trains on he  
Unties all of the strings  
  
Tell me something beautiful  
Tell me something free  
Tell me something beautiful  
And I wish that I could be  
  
Then I got my wings and I never even knew it  
When I was a worm, thought I couldn't get through it  
  
Come, come  
Toys all smell like children  
And scab-knees will obey  
I'll just have to kneel on broomsticks  
Just to make it go away  
  
(the inauguration of the worm)  
  
Then I got my wings and I never even knew it,  
When I was a worm, thought I couldn't get through it  
  
Because today  
Is black  
Because there is no turning back  
Because your lies have watered me  
I have become the strongest weed  
  
The taste of metal  
Dis integrator  
Three holes upon the leather belt  
It's cut and swollen  
And the age is swollen  
There's no one here to save our self  
  
This is what you should fear  
You are what you should fear  
  
This is what you should fear  
You are what you should fear  
  
This is what you should fear  
You are what you should fear

Play me  
Is this what you wanted? This is what you get  
Turned all your lives into this shit  
You never accepted or treated me fair  
Blame me for what I believe and I wear  
You fucked yourselves and you raised these sheep  
The blue and the withered seeds you will reap  
You never gave me a chance to be me  
Or even a fuckin' chance just to be  
But I have to show you that you played a role  
And I will destroy you with one simple hole  
The world that hates me has taken it's toll  
But now I have finally taken control  
You wanted so bad to make me this thing  
And I want you now to just kill the King  
An' I am not sorry, an' I am not sorry  
This is what you, you deserve  
I am not sorry, an' I am not sorry  
This is what you deserve  
An' I am not sorry, an' I am not sorry  
(King kill thirty three)  
This is what you, you deserve  
(King kill thirty three)  
An' I am not sorry, an' I am not sorry  
(King kill thirty three)  
This is what you, you deserve  
(King kill thirty three)  
King kill thirty three  
King kill thirty three  

There was Christ in the metal shell  
There was blood on the pavement  
The camera will make you god  
That's how jack became sainted  
  
If you die when there's no one watching  
Then your ratings drop and your forgotten  
But But if they kill you on their T.V.  
You're a martyr and a lamb of god  
Nothing's gunna change  
Nothing's gunna change the world  
  
There was Lennon in the happy gun  
There were words on the pavement  
We were looking for the lamb of god  
We were looking for Mark David  
  
If you die when there's no one watching  
Then your ratings drop and your forgotten  
But if they kill you on their T.V.  
You're a martyr and a lamb of god  
  
Nothing's gunna change the world  
Nothing's gunna change  
Nothing's gunna change the world  
Nothing's gunna change the world  
  
It took three days for him to die  
The born again to buy the serial rights  
Lamb of god have mercy on us  
Lamb of god will you grant us

Its not like I made myself a list of new and different ways,  
To murder your heart.  
I'm just a painting that's still wet.  
If you touch me Ill be smeared, you'll be stained,  
Stained for the rest of your life.  
  
So turn around and walk away  
Before we confuse the way, we abuse each other.  
If your not afraid of getting hurt  
Then I am not afraid of how much I hurt you  
I'm well aware I'm a danger to myself.  
  
Are you aware I'm a danger to others?  
There's a crack in my soul, you thought was a smile.  
What ever doesn't kill you,  
Is gonna leave a scar  
What ever doesn't kill you,  
Is gonna leave a scar  
I'm more like a silver bullet  
Than I'm like a gun,  
I'm not easy to hold.  
  
I'm moving fast and if I stay in your heart,  
I'm certain that this will be the end of your life  
So turn around walk away  
Before we confuse the way we abuse each other  
If your not afraid of getting hurt then I am not afraid  
  
How much I hurt you  
I'm well aware I'm a danger to myself  
Are you aware I'm a danger to others?

The clock is a ring on her finger  
That she checks  
When she's out of time  
The cigarette's a spike  
In the spur of the moment  
Digging in her side  
She cuts the paper with nails  
And her pen is bleeding poetry  
Nervous from the sex that she got  
And the wine that she spilled  
On her clean, white, white sheets  
Like to see you, baby,  
All torn up inside  
Girl you're dead already  
So just let your ego die  
Girl you're dead already  
So just let your ego die  
Die, die, die  

There's an apple in the pussy mouth  
Now I am the dinner whore  
There's a tumor in the t.v. mouth  
Burn it out before it grows  
Someone better get the dog to kick  
  
Jaws wired shut to save the dick  
Out of the bottomless pit comes the little horn  
"Little horn is born"  
The world spreads its legs for another star  
World shows its face for another scar  
  
Dead will dance for what is left  
The worms will wait with baited breath  
"Your blind have now become my deaf"  
So says this little horn  
"Save yourself from this..."

I want to fly into your sun  
Need faith to make me numb  
Live like a teenage christ  
I'm a saint, got a date with suicide  
  
Oh mary, mary  
To be this young is oh so scary  
Mary, mary  
To be this young I'm oh so scared  
I wanna live, I wanna love  
But it's a long hard road, out of hell  
I wanna live, I wanna love  
But it's a long hard road, out of hell  
  
You never said forever, could ever hurt like this  
You never said forever, could ever hurt like this  
  
Spin my way out of hell, there's nothing left this soul to sell  
  
Live fast and die you too  
How many times to do this for you?  
How many times to do this for you?  
  
Mary, mary  
To be this young I'm oh so scared  
I wanna live, I wanna love  
But it's a long hard road, out of hell  
I wanna live, I wanna love  
But it's a long hard road, out of hell  
  
You never said forever, could ever hurt like this  
You never said forever, could ever hurt like this  
  
I wanna live, I wanna love  
But it's a long hard road, out of hell  
  
Long hard road, out of hell  
  
I wanna live, I wanna love  
But it's a long hard road, out of hell  
  
Sell my soul for anything, anything but you  
Sell my soul for anything, anything but you

I'll spread me open, stuck to my ribs  
Are all your infants in abortion cribs  
You run like roaches, and you try to die  
I know your poison, in our space we'll lie  
To an obscene god we will dance and spit  
The skin is thin, in our beds we sit  
We take off our rings and we kneel  
Our scabbed knees are so slow to heal  
Sketch a little key hole  
For looking-glass people  
I don't want to be me  
I don't want to fear, no  
Momma's got a scarecrow  
Got to let the corn grow  
A man can't always reap what he sows  
(Cut, cut, cut in pantomime, mime, mime  
I'll be your devil if you'll admit you're mine)  
Leave yourself to be ultra-here  
The chill of fall is always crawling near  
Spiders in the flowers  
Never know their smell  
The barbers here know secrets  
They will never tell  
(Cut, cut, cut in pantomime, mime, mime  
I'll be your devil if you'll admit you're mine)

The ants are in the sugar  
The muscles atrophied  
We're on the other side, the screen is us and we're T. V.  
Spread me open,  
Sticking to my pointy ribs  
Are all your infants in abortion cribs  
I was born into this  
Everything turns to shit  
The boy that you loved is the man that you fear  
Pray until your number,  
Asleep from all your pain,  
Your apple has been rotting  
Tomorrow's turned up dead  
I have it all and I have no choice but to  
I'll make everyone pay and you will see  
You can kill yourself now  
Because you're dead  
In my mind  
The boy that you loved is the monster you fear  
Peel off all those eyes and crawl into the dark,  
You've poisoned all of your children to camouflage your scars  
Pray unto the splinters, pray unto your fear  
Pray your life was just a dream  
The cut that never heals  
Pray now baby, pray your life was just a dream  
(I am so tangled in my sins that I cannot escape)  
Pinch the head off, collapse me like a weed  
Someone had to go this far  
I was born into this  
Everything turns to shit  
The boy that you loved is the man that you fear  
Peel off all those eyes and crawl into the dark,  
You've poisoned all of your children to camouflage your scars  
Pray unto the splinters, pray unto your fear  
Pray your life was just a dream  
The cut that never heals  
Pray now baby, pray your life was just a dream  
The world in my hands, there's no one left to hear you scream  
There's no one left for you

6:30 this morning.  
I can't hear ya.  
I woke at 6:30 this morning with a headache.  
Oh  
I wonder to take 'em or not  
I wouldn't take 'em.  
I don't know, the headache is heavier than anything else.  
It's the first time that you took 'em?  
Second.  
Yeah  
I had a little bit of a headache this morning.  
I wouldn't take 'em, mom.  
I won't take 'em now, 'cause I have a toothache that hurts too a  
Little bit. I've taken everything I got, been thinkin'  
All that blood pressure medicine you take and stuff too. You  
Shouldn't take those things. You're better off not to sleep then to take the  
?  
Oh, my god! No wonder you got a headache! Your pressure's probably  
Sky high! Why don'tYou gotta take that every day!  
I try though  
Are you crazy?  
It's been 3 days  
That's probably why you have a headache nowDid you take it  
Today?  
I did this morning, yeah.  
That's probably why you have a headache, 'cause your pressure's up.  
Yeah.  
I don't know how you can forget to take it. And when that's the  
Only pill you take  
I'm sorry, I have so many pills you'd be surprised.  
Well, the blood pressure pill is the most important one.  
Yeah, I know  
There ain't no other one as important as that one.  
I got one more and then I gotta get to the store. I got two  
Refills on it.  
You only got one pill?!  
I only take one a day  
Well, yeah, but you shouldn't let 'em get that low  
I guess not, but I can take one in the morning and then go get  
Some more  
They're expensive! If you have to pay for 'em Procardia?  
No, the other one.  
Which ones?  
I gotta pay for procardia.  
Were you taking that every day?  
Yeah.

I looked up at the moon  
And I wasn't afraid

Shining trough the trees  
She's glowing on you  
Take a walk with me

You get sick enough  
To call the one

Bullet holes for eyes  
  
Fall on your knees  
I hear the horrid voices  
Of someone else's angels  
Fall on your knees  
I hear the horrid voices  
Of someone else's angels  
  
I broken open the box  
When I spoke the spell  
And I became  
An entrance wound  
To your bedroom grave  
And I was paid  
With the shadow of consensual rape  
  
Your ransom note  
Is quoted by  
Your death and  
Birth certificates  
And all of your love  
And all of your love letters  
Read just like my will  
  
Fall on your knees  
I hear the horrid voices  
Of someone else's angels  
Fall on your knees  
I hear the horrid voices  
Of someone else's angels

To know that murderers  
Are getting prettier  
Every day

To know that murderers  
Are getting prettier  
Every day  
I don't have to see

I'm as fake as e wedding cake  
And I'm Vague and I know that I'm homopolitan  
Pitifully predictable  
Correctly political  
  
I'm the new, I'm the new, new model  
I've got nothing inside  
Better in the head and in bed  
At the office  
I can suck and I smile  
New, new, new model  
  
I can choke and diet on coke  
I'm Spun and I know  
That I'm Stoned and Rolling  
  
Lifelike and poseable  
Hopeless and disposable  
  
I'm the new, I'm the new, new model  
I've got nothing inside  
Better in the head and in bed  
At the office  
I can suck and I smile  
New, new, new model  
  
Don't let them know how far you go  
Or that you use you "lovers"  
Oh look, you're like a vcr  
Stick something in to know  
Just who you are you  
  
New, new, new model

Crushing, cheating, changing  
Am I deaf or dead?  
Is this constricting construction  
Or just streets with rusty signs  
Of something violent coming?  
  
This'll hurt you worse than me  
I'm weak, seven days, I'm weak  
Don't run from me I won't  
Bother counting one, two, three  
  
I don't know which me that I love  
Got no reflection  
I don't know which me that I love  
Got no reflection  
  
Show myself how to make a noose  
A gun's cliche, and a razor too  
I'm not a death share vacation, vacant station  
Made of scars and filled with my old wounds  
  
This'll hurt you worse than me  
I'm weak, seven days, I'm weak  
Don't run from me I won't  
Bother counting one, two, three  
  
I don't know which me that I love  
Got no reflection  
I don't know which me that I love  
Got no reflection  
  
You, you don't even want to know what I'm gonna do to you  
You don't even want to know what I'm gonna do to you  
You don't even want to know what I'm gonna do to you  
You don't even want to know what I'm gonna do to you

[Verse:]  
Stood in the face of grim death  
Screaming monsters bring me to deafness  
My dagger and swagger are useless in the face of the mirror  
When the mirror is made of my face  
  
[Chorus:]  
This is the house of death  
Where even angels die in arms of demons  
This is the house of death  
Where even angels die in arms of demons...  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Hide your heart, in your gut (In Your Gut)  
But for what? When they're waiting to pull you apart like a scarecrow  
On death row, soon now all of your secrets are shown  
  
[Chorus:]  
This is the house of death  
Where even angels die in arms of demons  
This is the house of death  
Even angels die in arms of demons...

No-one is exempt from the odds of even  
No-one is exempt from the odds of even  
No-one is exempt from the odds of even  
No-one is exempt from the odds of even

I am the face of piss and shit and sugar  
I do a crooked little dance with my funny little monkey  
What I want what I want is just your children  
I hate what I have become to escape what I hated being  
Calliopenis envy from your daddy  
You're not gonna hear what he don't want to hear  
What I say disgusts him  
He wants to be me and that scares him  
"Let's do a funny little dance with my funny little monkey"  
The black keys  
Here is my real head, here is my real real head  
I wear this fucking mask because you cannot handle me  
Here is my real head  
They try to blink me not to think me  
Don't want to bring me out  
I am the rotten teeth, my fists are lined with suckers  
My prison skin's an eyesore-mirror-sketch-pad  
I am your son  
Your dad  
Your fag  
I am your fad

I fuck you because your famous  
I fuck you for your money  
I fuck you to control you  
I fuck you so somebody I can have half of everything  
I fuck you to fuck you over  
I fuck you until I  
I fuck you for a secret  
I fuck you because I can't remember  
If I already fucked you  
Whore  
I fuck you out of boredom  
I fuck you because I can't feel it anyway  
I fuck you to make the pain go away  
  
Fuck you because I love you  
Fuck you for loving you  
I don't need a reason to hate you the way I do  
  
Fuck you because I love you  
Fuck you for loving you  
I don't need a reason to hate you the way I do  
Hate you the way I do [Repeats]  
  
I fuck you so I can fucking feel  
Something  
Instead of nothing at all  
I fuck you because you are beautiful  
I fuck you because you're my nigger  
I fuck you because I'm your whore  
I fuck you because you are a whore  
I fuck you for fun  
I fuck you for fun  
I fuck you because I can  
I fuck you so I have a place to stay  
I fuck you so you will protect me  
  
Fuck you because I love you  
Fuck you for longing you too  
I don't need a reason to hate you the way I do

Your own personal Jesus  
Someone to hear your prayers  
Someone who cares  
Your own personal Jesus  
Someone to hear your prayers  
Someone who's there  
  
Feeling unknown  
And you're all alone  
Flesh and bone  
By the telephone  
Lift up the receiver  
I'll make you a believer  
  
Take second best  
Put me to the test  
Things on your chest  
You need to confess  
I will deliver  
You know I'm a forgiver  
  
Reach out and touch faith  
Reach out and touch faith  
Your own personal Jesus  
  
Feeling unknown  
And you're all alone  
Flesh and bone  
By the telephone  
Lift up the receiver

I will deliver  
You know I'm a forgiver  
  
Reach out and touch faith

Reach out and touch faith

She's got eyes like Zapruder  
And a mouth like heroin  
She wants me to be  
Perfect like Kennedy  
This isn't god, this isn't god  
God is just a statistic,  
God is just a statistic  
Say,  
"show me the dead stars,  
All of them sing."  
This is a riot  
Religious and clean  
  
God is a number you cannot count to  
You are post human and hardwired  
  
She's pilgrim and pagan  
Softworn and social  
In all of her dreams  
She's a saint like Jackie-o  
  
This isn't god, this isn't god  
God is just a statistic,  
God is just a statistic  
Say,  
"Show me the dead stars,  
All of them sing."  
This is a riot  
Religious and clean  
  
"All that glitters is cold, all that glitters is cold"

Marilyn:  
You harmed her, no reason why  
She fuckin hates yeah you  
Like she hates the"one true god"  
  
She tried to give you everything  
You just threw it away  
Turned it into bullshit  
And runned away  
  
Girl:  
Now its your turn  
To cry and beg  
For some miracle from your god  
And whine like a hog  
Everthing that comes  
Goes by  
Its your turn  
I hope you die  
In the shadow of the Valley of Death  
  
Marilyn:  
Shes now looking for me  
Someone who does aprecciate  
Like drugs for life  
  
Don't believe you let her go  
Now she gets me high high  
While you beg and fuck  
  
Girl x 2  
  
Marilyn:  
Now she sees the real thing  
Doesn't know  
Why she cryed for a motherfucker like you  
Like you... Like you.....  
  
Shouting both: This song is dedicated for all the motherfuckers  
Who harm with no reason, hey your not the drug, so don't try to be one  
Remember that shit comes.. And goes by... The sorrow exists

There's no earthly way of knowing  
Which direction we are going  
There's no knowing where we're going  
Or which way the wind is blowing  
Is it raining? Is it snowing  
Is a hurricane a-blowing  
Not a speck of light is showing  
So the danger must be growing  
Oh, the fires of hell are glowing  
Is the grisly reaper mowing  
Yes! The danger must be growing  
For the rowers keep on rowing  
And they're certainly not showing  
Any signs that they are slowing!  
Stop the boat!

This is for the people, they want you  
This is for the people, they want you  
This is for the people, they want you  
Getting high on violence, baby  
  
President Dead is clueless  
And he's caught in a head-lock, police state god  
And his skull is stained glass  
Incubated and jet set  
The bitter thinkers buy their tickets  
To go find god like a piggy in a fair  
  
And we don't want to live live forever  
And we know that suffering is so much better  
This is for the people, they want you  
This is for the people, they want you  
This is for the people, they want you  
Getting high on violence, baby  
  
Give the pills time to work  
We all can't be martyred in the  
Winter of your discontent  
Getting high on violence, baby  
Every night we are nailed into place and  
Every night we just can't seem to  
Ever remember the reason why  
Getting high on violence, baby  
  
And we don't want to live forever  
And we know that suffering is so much better  
This is for the people, they want to  
This is for the people, they want to  
This is for the people, they want to  
Getting high on violence, baby  
  
And we don't want to live live forever  
And we know that suffering is so much better  
And we don't want to live live forever  
And we know that suffering is so much better  
And we don't want to live live forever  
And we know that suffering is so much better  

Red (In My) Head  
Smiling faces on the wall  
I took a walk down the hall  
I banged my fist against the door  
I tossed a quarter to the whore  
The Camera flashes in my eyes  
I spread the news she spreads her thighs  
Red, red in my head  
Red, red in my head  
  
I grabbed her knuckles and I yanked them all  
I bent her in half like a barbie doll  
Love, hate, viscerate  
Take this flesh and meditate  
  
I sat there with her  
We sat there 2  
She said to me  
What should we do  
Well, I know some tricks  
And I'll show them to you  
Your mother won't mind at all if I do  
To you  
  
The poor little girl  
The poor little girl  
The poor little girl didn't know what to say  
For her mother was out of the house today  
Today  
Today  
Red, red in my head  
Red, red in my head  
  
[?]  
The poor little girl  
The poor little girl  
The poor little girl didn't know what to say  
For her mother was out of the house today  
Today  
Today  
Red, red in my head  
Red, red in my head  
[?]  
  
Red, red they call me red  
Red, in bed  
The girl

I am your monster to devour  
You can see the smiles on the ones I have deflowered  
What can you say?  
What will you do?  
Your bark is bigger than the bite  
Of the dog shadow eating you  
I can see you, you can't hide  
I am the maggot in the apple of your eye  
Scaredy cat, scaredy cat, scaredy cat  
You're a...  
Scaredy cat, scaredy cat, scaredy cat  
You're a...  
Scaredy cat, scaredy cat, scaredy cat  
You're a...  
Scaredy cat, scaredy cat, scaredy cat  
You're a...  
I can't believe in you  
Scaredy cat, scaredy cat, scaredy cat  
You're a...  
  

She's Not my Girlfriend  
Her heart is in my hand  
It shivers like a toad  
She tries to understand the  
Tiny lump that's down inside her throat  
It goes  
Suck suck  
Suck suck  
Suck suck  
  
Her head is in my lap  
It twists and coughs and sings  
Her hair is in my grasp  
It hangs and swings like swollen strings  
It goes  
Suck suck  
Suck suck  
Suck suck  
  
Her face is inside out  
An open book report  
I read what she's about  
And she's filled with words that hurt  
It goes  
Suck suck  
Suck suck  
Suck suck  
  
Sometimes I want her in  
Sometimes I want her out  
My perception of sin  
Is filled with pain and fear and doubt  
  
She she she she, she isn't my girlfriend  
No no, I'm not who you think I am  
She she, she isn't my girlfriend  
No no, I'm not who you think I am  
  
Her clothes are on the ground  
A crumpled rainbow mass  
She's scattered all around  
And she's scattered now like broken glass  
It goes  
Suck suck  
Suck suck  
Suck suck  
  
Sometimes I want her in  
Sometimes I want her out  
My perception of sin  
Is filled with pain and fear and doubt  
  
She she she she, she isn't my girlfriend  
No no, I'm not who you think I am  
She she, she isn't my girlfriend  
No no, I'm not who you think I am  
  
She she, she isn't my girlfriend

Sick city, yeah, restless people  
Sick city burn their houses down  
To make the sky look pretty  
What can I do?  
I'm just a person  
This is a lie we always seem to hear  
You just sit and things get worse  
Watch tv and drink your beer  
Walking all alone  
Not going anywhere  
Walking all alone  
Nobody seems to care  
Restless as wind  
This town is killing me  
Gotta put an end to this  
Restless misery  
And I'm just one of those restless people  
That can never be satisfied with living  
In this sick ol' sick ol' sick sick sick city  
Might be too late for me to say goodbye  
Might be too late to watch this sick ol' city die  
Go on the road,  
Yeah im gonna try to say  
Sick city so long farewell  
Goodbye and die

Walking, waiting alone without a care  
Hoping and hating the things that I can't bear  
Did you think it's cool to walk right up  
To take my life and fuck it up? Well did you? Well did you?  
  
I see Hell in your eyes  
I'm taken in by surprise  
And touching you makes me feel alive  
And touching you makes me die inside  
  
Walking, waiting alone without a care  
Hoping and hating the things that I can't bear  
Did you think it's cool to walk right up  
To take my life and fuck it up? Well did you? I hate you  
  
I see Hell in your eyes  
I'm taken in by surprise  
And touching you makes me feel alive  
And touching you makes me die inside  
  
I've slept so long without you  
It's tearing me apart too  
How'd it get this far  
Playing games with this old heart?  
  
I've killed a million petty souls  
But I couldn't kill you  
I've slept so long without you  
  
(Touching you makes me die inside)  
I see hell in your eyes  
(Touching you makes me die inside)  
I'm taken in by surprise  
  
(Touching you makes me die inside)  
And touching you makes me feel alive  
(Touching you makes me die inside)  
And touching you makes me die inside  
  
(Touching you makes me die inside)  
I see hell in your eyes  
(Touching you makes me die inside)  
I'm taken in by surprise  
  
(Touching you makes me die inside)  
And touching you makes me feel alive  
(Touching you makes me die inside)  
And touching you makes me die inside  
  
(Touching you makes me die inside)  
I see hell in your eyes  
(Touching you makes me die inside)  
I'm taken in by surprise  
(Touching you makes me die inside)

I'll pretend that I want you for what is on the inside  
But when I get inside I'll just want to get out  
I'm your first and last deposit through sickness and in hell  
I'll never you promise you a garden, you'll just water me down  
  
I can't believe that you are for real  
I don't care as long as you're mine  
  
When I said "we" you know I meant "me"  
And when I said "sweet" I meant "dirty"  
When I said "we" you know I meant "me"  
And when I said "sweet" I meant "dirty"  
  
I'm unsafe  
I'm unsafe  
I won't regret  
So I memorize the words to the porno movies  
It's the only thing I want to believe  
I memorize the words to the porno movies  
This is a new religion to me  
I'm a VCR funeral, a definite waste  
My smile's a chainlink fence, that I have put up  
I love the enemy, my love is the enemy  
They say they don't want fame  
But they get famous when we fuck  
  
When I said "we" you know I meant "me"  
And when I said "sweet" I meant "dirty"  
When I said "we" you know I meant "me"  
And when I said "sweet" I meant "dirty"  
  
I'm unsafe  
I'm unsafe  
I won't regret  
So I memorize the words to the porno movies  
It's the only thing I want to believe  
I memorize the words to the porno movies  
This is a new religion to me  
  
I never believed the devil was real  
But God couldn't make someone filthy as you  
  
When I said "we" you know I meant "me"  
And when I said "sweet" I meant "dirty"  
When I said "we" you know I meant "me"  
And when I said "sweet" I meant "dirty"  
When I said "we" you know I meant "me"  
And when I said "sweet" I meant "dirty"  
When I said "we" you know I meant "me"  
And when I said "sweet" I meant "dirty"  
  
You are the church, and I am the steeple  
When we fuck, we are all God's people  
You are the church, and I am the steeple  
When we fuck, we are all God's people

Wrench is just a household god but I carry mine with pride  
I don't work but I can work with it to split your smile  
Run you down without a twitch your car's just not as big as mine  
Tear the son out of your bitch and sprinkle your remains with lime  
I ain't no workin' man I do the best I can I got the devil's hand rollin'
sixes  
I am the habit man I use up all I can I got the slacker's hand  
My afternoon's remote control, daydream milk and genocide  
Tranquility with broken knees, silly putty enemies  
Butter knife in your side  
What I got I got for free, middle finger technology  
What's yours is mine, yours is mine, told you fucker, yours is mine  
Snake eyes for sissies  
I am the pedophiles dream, a messianic peter pan  
Just a boy, just a boy, just a little fucking boy, I can never be a man

Son of Man  
Rise up Son of Man  
New York cities' Son of Sam  
With a gun in hand  
He reaps the wimen of our land  
  
Blood and family does his death depravity  
Keep out of his way  
Live to lie another day  
  
He picked up a .44 calibur gun  
To shoot her down, down  
  
He was told to kill  
Dogs and Demons gave him will  
Fear and roaming nights  
Some remember hating life  
  
Nobody wants him  
He just stares at the world  
Planning his vengance  
That he will soon unfurl  
  
Now the time is here  
For Son of Sam to spread fear  
Father holy ghost, wicked son who kills the most  
  
Nobody wants him  
They just turn their heads  
Nobody helps him  
Now he has his revenge  
  
Down, down, down...  
  
Gunshots full of lead  
Fills his victims full of dread  
Running as fast as they can  
Son of Sam killed again!  
  
Down, down, down...  
Down, down, down...

The beauty spot was borrowed and  
Now my sweet knife rusts tomorrow.  
I'm a confession that is waiting to be heard.  
Burn your empty rain down on me  
Whisper your death beat so softly  
We bend our knees  
At the altar of my ego  
You drained my heart  
And made a spade  
But there's still traces of me  
in your veins  
You drained my heart  
And made a spade  
But there's still traces of me  
in your veins  
All my lilies' mouths are open  
Like they're begging for dope  
And hoping  
Their bitter petal chant,  
"We can kick , you won't be back."  
I'm a diamond that is tired  
Of all the faces I've acquired  
We must secure the shadow  
Ere the substance fades  
You drained my heart  
And made a spade  
But there's still traces of me  
in your veins  
You drained my heart  
And made a spade  
But there's still traces of me  
in your veins  
And we said 'til we die  
And we said 'til we die

If I had time to kill the world I'd try  
Ohh, no, but I'm busy, killing me  
I don't have time to build a suicide  
Because the snowman melts in spring  
The striped girls will not be coming back  
In the summer they run from me, May  
I don't have time to even say goodbye  
We are dying as winter leaves spring  
Snow melts in my lawn and I am free, yeah  
Corn cob pipe and a button nose, yeah  
Puddled in the grass two lump of coal  
Snow melts in my lawn and I am  
If I had time to kill the world I'd try  
But I'm busy killing what's in me  
I don't have time to even say goodbye  
We are dying as winter leaves spring  
Snow melts in my lawn and I am free, yeah  
Corn cob pipe and a button nose, yeah  
Spring, spring, spring, spring  
Spring, spring, spring, spring

Am i sorry your sky went black,  
Put your knives in babies backs?  
Am i sorry you killed the kennedy's and huxley too?  
  
  
But i'm sorry shakespeare  
Was your scapegoat  
And your apples sticking into my throat  
Sorry your sunday smiles are rusty nails  
And your crucifixion commercials failed  
But i'm just a pitiful anonymous  
  
  
And i see all the young believers  
Your target audience  
I see all the old deceivers  
We all just sing their song  
  
  
Am i sorry to be alive  
Putting my face in the beehive?  
Am i sorry for booth and oswald, pinks and cocaine too?  
  
  
I'm sorry you never check  
The bag in my head for a bomb  
And my halo was a needle hole  
I'm sorry i saw a priest being beaten  
And i made a wish  
But i'm just a pitiful anonymous  
  
  
And i see all the young believers  
Your target audience  
I see all the old deceivers  
We all just sing their song  
We all just sing their song  
  
  
"the valley of death we are free  
Your father's your prison you see"  
  
  
And i see all the young believers  
Your target audience  
I see all the old deceivers  
We all just sing their song  
  
  
You're just a copy of an imitation

Hey God, why are you doing this to me?  
Am I not living up to what I'm supposed to be?  
Why am I seething with this animosity?  
Hey God, I think you owe me a great big apology.  
  
Terrible lie  
Terrible lie  
Terrible lie  
Terrible lie  
  
Hey God, I really don't know what you mean.  
Seems like salvation comes only in our dreams.  
I feel my hatred grow all the more extreme.  
Hey God, can this world really be as sad as it seems?  
  
Terrible lie  
Terrible lie  
Terrible lie

Hey God, I believed your promises.Your promises were lies.  
  
Terrible lie  
Terrible lie  
Terrible lie  
Terrible lie  
  
You made me throw it all away.  
My morals left to decay.  
How many you betray.

My skin is begging you please.  
I'm on my hands and knees.  
I want so much to believe.  
  
Hey God

We'll be the worms in your apple pie  
Fake abuse for our bios  
Blacken our own eyes  
The grass isn't greener on the other side  
We set it on fire  
And we have no reason why.  
Set fashion, not follow  
Spit vitriol, not swallow  
We set fashion, not follow  
Spit vitriol, not swallow  
  
We're  
Good for nothing but being  
Everything that's bad  
Good for nothing but being  
Everything that's bad  
We know who we are and what we want to say  
And we don't care who's listening  
We don't rebel to sell  
It just suits us well  
We're the bright young things  
I've got my villain necktie  
And a mouth of hi-fi  
So sharp, I'm bleeding  
from my Judas Hole  
I'm the Arch Dandy  
No-goodnik and I'm headed  
For Crashville.  
  
I'm most monster with my groan box  
In the "Meat Show."  
We set fashion, not follow  
Spit vitriol, not swallow  
Good for nothing but being  
Everything that's bad  
Good for nothing but being  
Everything that's bad  
We know who we are and what we want to say  
And we don't care who's listening  
We don't rebel to sell  
It just suits us well  
We're the bright young things  
Crashing the ether  
We've got the loudest stereotype  
Even neophytes deep 6 your pro-life.  
  
We Don't need to move a single prayer bone  
We're so beautiful and damned  
Simply as a "still life."  
Perpetual rebellion with absolutely no cause  
Perpetual rebellion with absolutely no cause  
Perpetual rebellion with absolutely no cause  
Perpetual rebellion with absolutely no cause  
  
Stop the song and remember what you used to be  
Somebody that fucking impressed me  
We know who we are and what we want to say  
And we don't care who's listening  
We don't rebel to sell  
It just suits us well  
We're the bright young things  
We know who we are and what we want to say  
And we don't care who's listening  
We don't rebel to sell  
It just suits us well  
  
We're the bright young things  
Good for nothing but being  
Everything that's bad  
Good for nothing but being  
Everything that's bad

We're on a bullet and were headed straight into god  
Even he'd like to end it too  
We take a pill, get a face, buy our ticket  
And we hope heaven is true  
I saw cop beat a priest on the T.V.  
And I know they killed our heroes too  
  
We sing the death song kids  
Because we got no future  
And we wanna be just like you  
We wanna be just like you  
We wanna be just like you  
We sing the death song kids  
  
We light a candle on a earth we made into hell  
And we pretend that we're in heaven  
Each time we do we get the blind man's ticket  
And we know that nothing is true  
I saw a priest kill a cop on the TV  
And I know they're our heroes too  
  
We sing the death song kids  
Because we got no future  
And we wanna be just like you  
We wanna be just like you  
We wanna be just like you  
We sing the death song kids  
We sing the death song kids  
  
We sing the death song kids  
We sing the death song kids  
We write our prayers on a little bomb  
Kiss it on the face and send it to God  
  
We sing the death song kids  
Because we got no future  
And we wanna be just like you  
We wanna be just like you  
We wanna be just like you  
We were the world, but we got no future  
We wanna be just like you  
We wanna be just like you  
We wanna be just like you  
We were the world, but we got no future  
We wanna be just like you  
We wanna be just like you  
We wanna be just like you  
  
We sing the death song kids

[Verse 1]  
I don't want your God and your higher power  
I want power to get higher  
And I'm not a liar, and I'm not a liar  
When you look up, what do you see?  
I don't need a motherfucker looking down on me  
Motherfucker looking down on me  
At least I know wherever I go  
I've got the devil beneath my feet  
At least I know wherever I go  
I've got the devil beneath my feet  
Beneath my feet  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't bring your black heart to bed  
When I wake up you best be God  
Or you better be dead  
  
Don't bring your black hearth to bed  
When I wake up you best be God  
Or you better be dead  
  
[Verse 2]  
This what happens when you put an apple on your head  
You can laugh all day but you can't laugh the darkness away  
Can't laugh the darkness away  
Too many pills and not enough kills  
I need the Bug House, or the Big House  
They'll never take me alive, never take me alive  
Never fucking take me alive  
It's better to be blamed for robbing Peter  
Than guilty for paying Paul  
It's better to be blamed for robbing Peter  
Than guilty for paying Paul  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't bring your black heart to bed  
When I wake up you best be God  
Or you better be dead

The Abraham Lincoln town cars  
Arrive to dispose of our king and queen  
They orchestrated dramatic new scenes  
For Celebritarian needs  
  
When one world ends  
Something else begins  
But without a scream  
Just a whisper because we  
Just start it over again  
  
Do you love your guns?  
Your god and your government?  
Let me hear you  
Hey  
Do you love your guns?  
Do you love your god and your government?  
Let me hear you goddamn it  
Hey  
Do you love your guns?  
And your god and your government?  
Let me hear you  
Hey  
Your mother?  
And your father?  
And your baby?  
Goddamn it let me hear you  
Hey  
Do you love your guns?  
I want your mothers and your fathers  
To hear you say it  
Hey  
Every single one of you motherfuckers  
Let me hear it from you  
Hey  
Do you love your guns?  
And your god and your government?  
Hey  
I want to hear it from everyone  
I want to hear you say you want a gun  
Let me hear it  
Hey

Nothing suffocates you more than  
The passing of everyday human events  
Isolation is the oxygen mask you make  
Your children breath into survive  
  
But I'm not a slave to god  
That doesn't exist  
And I'm not a slave to world  
That doesn't give a shit  
  
And when we were good  
You just closed your eyes  
So when we are bad  
We'll scar your minds  
  
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!  
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!  
  
You'll never grow up to be a big-rock-star-  
Celebrated-victim-of-your-fame  
They'll just cut our wrists like  
Cheap coupons and say that death  
Was on sale today  
  
And when we were good  
You just closed your eyes  
So when we are bad  
We'll scar your minds  
  
But I'm not a slave to god  
That doesn't exist  
And I'm not a slave to world  
That doesn't give a shit  
  
The death of one is a tragedy  
The death of one is a tragedy  
The death of one is a tragedy  
The death of millions is just a statistic  
  
But I'm not a slave to god  
That doesn't exist  
And I'm not a slave to world  
That doesn't give a shit  
But I'm not a slave to god  
That doesn't exist  
And I'm not a slave to world  
That doesn't give a shit  
  
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!  
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!  

-From Clone High-  
  
The ancient pharoh's were not to bright they say  
But they made one contribution, that I live by to this day  
It's the food pyramid, and it's approved by the U.S.D.A.  
  
Oh, grains are the foundation, so please take my advice  
Have five to eleven servings of bread, cereal, or rice  
Three to five of vegitables, and four of fruits is best  
Thier anti-oxidents and fiber help you to digest  
Three servings of yogurt, milk, and cheese  
Will help your bones and subsidise the cattle industry  
A body needs to grow  
And growing takes proteins  
That's why meat can be a tasty treat like fish or human beings  
And when you eat your sweets, make sure you try  
To limit your servings, or you'll DIE!!!  
  
EVERYBODY!  
  
My body is a pyramid that's made of healthy food  
So do what we say  
(yeah)  
Eat right every day  
(food)  
I love you.

[Verse:]  
I don't know if I can open up  
I've been opened enough  
I don't know if I can open up  
I'm not a birthday present  
I'm aggressive regressive  
The past is over  
And passive scenes so pathetic  
  
[Pre-Chorus:]  
I was fated, faithful, fatal  
I was fated, faithful, fatal  
  
[Chorus:]  
I feel stoned and alone like a heretic  
Ready to meet my maker  
I feel stoned and alone like a heretic  
I'm ready to meet my maker  
Lazarus has got no dirt on me  
Lazarus has got no dirt on me  
And I'll rise to every occasion  
I'm the Mephistopheles of Los Angeles  
Of Los Angeles  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Don't know if I can open up  
I been opened too much  
Double cross glossed over in my path-os  
  
[Pre-Chorus:]  
I was fated, faithful, fatal  
I was fated, faithful, fatal  
  
[Chorus:]  
I feel stoned and alone like a heretic  
Ready to meet my maker

Today I'm dirty  
And I want to be pretty  
Tomorrow, I know I'm just dirt  
Today I'm dirty  
And I want to be pretty  
Tomorrow, I know I'm just dirt  
  
We are the nobodies  
Wanna be somebodies  
When we're dead  
They'll know just who we are  
We are the nobodies  
Wanna be somebodies  
When we're dead  
They'll know just who we are  
  
Yesterday I was dirty  
Wanted to be pretty  
I know now that I'm forever dirt  
Yesterday I was dirty  
Wanted to be pretty  
I know now that I'm forever dirt  
  
We are the nobodies  
Wanna be somebodies  
When we're dead  
They'll know just who we are  
We are the nobodies  
Wanna be somebodies  
When we're dead  
They'll know just who we are  
  
Some children died the other day  
We fed machines and then we prayed  
Puked up and down in morbid faith  
You should have seen the ratings that day  
Some children died the other day  
We fed machines and then we prayed  
Puked up and down in morbid faith  
You should have seen the ratings that day  
  
We are the nobodies  
Wanna be somebodies  
When we're dead  
They'll know just who we are  
We are the nobodies  
Wanna be somebodies  
When we're dead

When we're dead  
They'll know just who we are

Love. Blood. War.  
Desire. Deceit. Control.  
It's killing you for everyone.  
Just stick around until I'm gone.  
I love you so it hurts.  
For whatever that is worth.  
  
And no time will fade away,  
The rumors and the lies.  
And no one will remember,  
If you even said goodbye.  
  
What's the point in dying,  
When the world thinks you're already dead?  
What's the point in crying,  
With the rain beating down on your head?  
  
Greed. Hate. Lust.  
Divide. Disgust. Distrust.  
Happiness comes in a pill,  
From a fifteen-story windowsill.  
You'll love me till I die,  
Or at least until I try.  
  
The after words don't mean a thing,  
The problems still persist.  
Don't think about the stories,  
And the bullshit that you missed.  
  
What's the point in dying,  
When the world thinks you're already dead?  
What's the point in crying,  
With the rain beating down on your head?  
What's the point in lying,  
If no one believes what you say?  
What's the point in dying,  
If you're already dead anyway?  
  
If you're already dead anyway.  
If you're already dead anyway.  
  
I hope you will remember me.  
At least say so, to comfort me.  
You say goodbye so easily.  
It's now or never.  
It may seem really pitiful.  
But life became too beautiful.  
The pain of love unbearable.  
It's now or never.  
Gone forever.

They slit our throats  
Like we were flowers  
And our milk has been  
Devoured  
  
When you want it  
It goes away too fast  
When you hate it  
It always seems to last  
But just remember when you think  
You're free  
The crack inside your fucking heart is me  
  
(Thought, not spoken):  
I want to outrace the speed of pain for another day  
  
I wish I could sleep  
But I can't lay on my back  
Because there's a knife  
For everyday that I've known you  
  
When you want it  
It goes away too fast  
When you hate it  
It always seems to last  
  
But just remember when you think  
You're free  
The crack inside your fucking heart is me  
  
(Thought, not spoken):  
I want to outrace the speed of pain for another day  
  
Lie to me, cry to me, give to me  
I would  
Lie with me, die with me, give to me  
I would  
Keep all your secrets wrapped in dead hair  
I hope at least we die holding hands for always.

The Telephone  
Another night of too much cough syrup  
I'm awakened by the incessant ringing of a telephone  
I still have dreams caked in the corners of my eyes  
And my mouth is dry and tastes shitty  
  
Again the ringing  
  
Slowly I bustle out of bed  
The remnants of an erection still lingering in my shorts  
Like a bothersome guest  
  
Again the ringing  
  
Carefully I abscond to the bathroom  
As to not display my manhood to others  
There I make the perfunctory morning faces  
Which always seem to precede my daily contribution  
To the once-blue toilet water  
That I always enjoy making green  
  
Again the ringing  
  
I shake twice like most others  
And I'm annoyed by the dribble that always seems to remain  
Causing a small acreage of wetness on the front of my briefs  
I slowly languidly, lazily, crazily,  
Stumble into the den  
Where my father smokes his guitars  
I mean cigars  
In his easy chair  
I know all about easy chairs  
And then I sing a song for my friends  
  
Jesus is my boyfriend  
Jesus is my boyfriend  
You can't have him  
Because jesus is my boyfriend  
  
Ringing ringing  
Dang it goddamn motherfucking son-of-a-bitch is ringing  
I walk into the kitchen and I  
Stare blankly at that shrieking plastic bastard  
Since it keeps ringing I know it's her  
And since it keeps ringing she knows it's me  
  
We are the world, we are the children  
We are the ones who make a darker day  
So let's start killing  
There's a choice you're making  
We're sparing our own lives  
It's true we'll make a darker day  
Just you and me

I kill myself in small amounts  
In each relationship it's not about love  
Just another funeral  
And just another girl left in tears  
  
And I'm waiting  
With the sound turned off, I'm waiting  
Like a glass balloon, I'm fading  
Into the void and then I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone  
  
They said that hell's not hot  
They said that hell's not hot  
  
I gave my soul to someone else  
She must have known that it was already sold  
But it was never about her  
It was about the hurt  
  
So, I'm waiting  
With the sound turned off, I'm waiting  
Like a glass balloon, I'm fading  
Into the void and then I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone  
  
I kill myself in small amounts  
In each relationship it's not about love  
Just another funeral  
And just another girl left in tears  
  
Waiting  
With the sound turned off, I'm waiting  
Like a glass balloon, I'm fading  
Into the void and then I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone  
  
Waiting  
Waiting  
I'm fading  
I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone  
  
They said that hell's not hot  
They said that hell's not hot  
They said that hell's not hot  
They said that hell's not hot

You want to look like me.  
You want to act like me.  
You've got no sense of your own identity.  
You can't begin to see  
  
That you and me makes we.  
That's not what I want to be  
So fuck you.  
Imitation's not a flattery.  
  
You can't begin to feel, you can't begin to feel,  
You can't begin to feel.  
I said fuck you

You motherfucker  
You are made  
From things you steal from me.  
  
You can't begin to feel, can't begin to feel,  
Can't begin to feel  
So fuck you  
You suck my energy, my personality.  
  
You steal steal steal from me.  
You can't begin to feel, can't begin to feel,  
Can't begin to feel

Imitation's not a flattery.  
So you're a pitiful thief, you're a pitiful thief,  
You're a pitiful thief.  
Fuck you.  
  
I don't want to know you, I don't want to know.  
It's about time, I've made up my mind.  
Get out of my life you motherfucker.

You motherfucker  
You are made from things you steal from me.  
You can't begin to feel, can't begin to feel, can't begin to feel.  
  
Fuck you.  
If you want to worship me then just worship me.  
Don't even try to be.  
You're a fucking thief, you're a fucking thief, a fucking thief.  
  
Fuck you.  
Imitation's not a flattery.  
You're a fucking thief.  
I don't want to know you.

We've only reached the third day of a seven day binge  
I can already see your name disintegrated from my lips  
We've only reached the third day of a seven day binge  
I can already see your name disintegrated from my lips  
  
I can't decide if you're wearing me out or wearing me well  
I just still feel like I'm condemned to wear someone else's hell  
We've only reached the third day of a seven day binge  
I can always see your name and disintegrated from my lips  
  
I got bullets in the booth  
Rather be your victim, than be with you  
I got bullets in the booth  
Rather be your victim, than be with you  
  
We've only reached the third day of a seven day binge  
I can already see your name disintegrated from my lips!  
Rather be your victim, than be with you!  
Rather be your victim, than be with you!

Pig hands reach into my sides, yeah

She's made of hair and bone and little teeth  
And things that cannot speak  
She comes on like a crippled plaything  
Her spine is just a string  
  
I wrapped our love in all this foil  
Silver tight like spider legs  
I never wanted it to ever spoil  
But flies will always lay their eggs  
  
Take your hatred out on me  
Make your victim my head  
You never ever believed in me  
I am your tourniquet  
  
Prosthetic synthesis and butterfly  
Sealed up with virgin stitch  
If it hurts baby please tell me  
Preserve the innocence  
I never wanted it to end like this  
But flies will lay their eggs  
  
Take your hatred out on me  
Make your victim my head  
You never ever believed in me  
I am your tourniquet  
  
What I wanted, what I needed  
What I got for me  
What I wanted, what I needed  
What I got for me  
  
Take your hatred out on me  
Make your victim my head  
You never ever believed in me  
I am your tourniquet  
  
Take your, take your  
Get up out of me  
I'm not proud with me  
I never ever believed in me

Go aheah and build a better messiah, we can dig another grave  
This is your calling.  
If you are hearing this, there is nothing I can do  
Something has grown in my chest.  
And I have seen it.  
It is hard and cold.  
It's been dormant for many years.  
I have tried to save you, but I cannot come to save you  
But this is what you deserve  
This is whta we deserve  
This is something that we have brought upon ourselves  
We are not a victim, you are not a victim  
We are not a victim, you are not a victim  
God will grovel before me.  
God will crawl at my feet.  
These are the dying years.  
These are the dying years.  
When you are suffering, know that I have betrayed you.

If you want to know how  
To fly high, then go now  
To the place where all the concubines...  
  
Meet and converse with them  
Marvel at their pale skin  
Wonder how they chew on their pointy...  
  
Teeth and hair are beauty  
They know it's their duty  
To be countess in their hearts and their...  
  
Minds that have to whisper  
See in them a sister  
Look into their eyes and you'll become  
  
Transylvanian Concubine.  
You know what flows here like wine.  
Stay here with us, it's just time.  
Transylvanian Concubine.  
  
Sorrow is their master  
Cackling with laughter  
Now he's having just one piece of...  
  
Cakey is their make-up  
Catholics try to shake up  
All the things that form their lives, but they're...  
  
Dead, their sighs, their songs  
They know what they do is wrong.  
Stay here with us, it's just time.  
Transylvanian Concubine.  
  
Candelabra's lighted  
Satan has been sighted  
Never has there been an evening like...  
  
This is what they wanted  
Always to feel hunted  
You can never be too rich or too...  
  
Thin. The blood has run out.  
Fangs ruin any cute pout  
Morning has come now they've flown  
What have you learned from what has been shown?

How the fuck are we supposed to know  
When I'm a monster, the way  
You refuse to die?  
How the fuck are we supposed to know  
If we're in love or if in we're pain  
  
I'm a tightrope walker  
Can't find my circus  
And I'm damaged beyond repair  
Now you're just a coffin of a girl I knew  
And I'm buried in you  
  
You never said "I'll end up like this"  
Or "so"  
You never said "I'll end up like this"  
No  
  
Sometimes I dream I'm an exterminating angel  
A traveling executioner from heaven  
Sent to give you the prettiest death I know  
Call the grave and make our reservations  
  
You never said "I'll end up like this"  
You never said "I'll end up like this"  
No,  
You never said "I'll end up like this"  
You never said "I'll end up like this"  
No,  
You never said "I'll end up like this"  
You never said "I'll end up like this"  
No  
  
Are we in love or are we in pain? [Repeat: x5]  
  
How the fuck are we supposed to know  
When I'm a monster, the way  
You refuse to die?  
How the fuck are we supposed to know  
If we're in love or if in we're pain  
Why is my wound a front door to you?  
Am I my own shadow?  
Why is my wound a front door to you?  
Am I my own shadow?

I am overground and  
Out-selling it.  
Since god thinks I don't exist  
The beatings happen per minute  
This is not  
Blue-collar-white-corrective politics  
I'm on a hate American style  
Kick.  
  
This is the black collar song  
Put it in your middle finger and sing along  
Use your fist and not your mouth  
(come on, come on)  
This is the black collar song  
Put it in your middle finger and sing along  
Use your fist and not your mouth  
(come on, come on)  
  
I'm on a campaign for pain  
And when I get elected  
I'll wipe the white of your house  
The smile off your face  
  
This is the black collar song  
Put it in your middle finger and sing along  
Use your fist and not your mouth  
(come on, come on)  
This is the black collar song  
Put it in your middle finger and sing along  
Use your fist and not your mouth  
(come on, come on)  
I woke up today and wished for tomorrow  
I don't want to be like anyone else  
I woke up today and wished for tomorrow  
I don't want to even be myself  
  
I said, no, this isn't your song  
We can't all get along  
It's too hard to hold hands when  
Your hand's a fist  
My hate-pop won't ever stop  
I'm fucking glad we're different  
This is my hate american style  
Hit.  
  
Don't bring, don't sing it  
Use your fist and not your mouth.  
  
This is the black collar song  
Put it in your middle finger and sing along  
Use your fist and not your mouth  
(come on, come on)  
This is the black collar song  
Put it in your middle finger and sing along  
Use your fist and not your mouth  
(come on, come on)  
I woke up today and wished for tomorrow  
I don't want to be like anyone else  
I woke up today and wished for tomorrow  
I don't want to even be myself

Use me when you want to come  
I've bled just to have your touch  
When I'm in you I want to die  
  
User friendly fucking dopestar obscene  
Will you die when you're high  
You'd never die just for me  
She says,  
"I'm not in love, but I'm gonna fuck you  
'til somebody better comes along."  
  
Use me like I was a whore  
Relationships are such a bore  
Delete the ones that you've fucked  
  
User friendly fucking dopestar obscene  
Will you die when you're high  
You'd never die just for me  
She says,  
"I'm not in love, but I'm gonna fuck you  
'til somebody better comes along."

She was the color of TV  
Her mouth curled under like a metal snake  
Although Holy Wood was sad  
They'd remember this as Valentines day  
Flies are waiting  
  
In the shadow of the valley of death  
In the shadow of the valley of death  
They slit our wrists and send us to heaven  
The first flower after the flood  
  
I saw that pregnant girl today  
She didn't know that it was dead inside  
Even though it was alive  
Some of us are really born to die  
Flies are waiting  
  
In the shadow of the valley of death  
In the shadow of the valley of death  
They slit our wrists and send us to heaven  
The first flower after the flood  
  
In the shadow of the valley of death  
In the shadow of the valley of death  
In the shadow of the valley of death  
In the shadow of the valley of death  
In the shadow of the valley of death  
In the shadow of the valley of death  
In the shadow of the valley of death  
In the shadow of the valley of death  

I wake up everyday on  
The wrong side of the bed  
But I won't lay down on the floor  
Like I'm the whore in your head  
Call me a failure  
Pretender, sex-offender, infector  
Say I killed all my friends  
And I deserve to be dead.  
  
Kiss baby kiss

We're 5 middle fingers on a motherfucking hand  
  
I won't pull out I just came  
I want all of the blame  
your love is tin, faith is thin  
No concept of pain, right to complain  
All you fagazines, senile teens  
Jaw me black ball me  
Deejay yourself away and turn your back  
It will be easier to stab  
  
Kiss baby kiss

We're 5 middle fingers on a motherfucking hand  
  
VIP add TRD violent shiny hate crime  
"Total Requested Dead" it's  
Version point (less) downloadable suicide.  
The only ones left standing are the ones not demanding  
This isn't a show, this is my fucking life  
I'm not ashamed you're entertained  
But  
I'm not a puppet  
I am a grenade  
I'm not ashamed you're entertained  
But  
I'm not a puppet  
I am a grenade  
  
Kiss baby kiss  
Bang baby bang  
Suck baby suck  
It's Vodevil  
Kiss baby kiss  
Bang baby bang  
Suck baby suck  
It's Vodevil  
  
This isn't music and we're not a band  
We're 5 middle fingers on a motherfucking hand  
This isn't music and we're not a band  
We're 5 middle fingers on a motherfucking hand

[Verse:]  
You're a paper doll  
I fold you how I want  
You're not my noose  
I tied this knot  
If this won't be  
Our fingers locked together  
This is total war  
Method not objective  
  
Cannot say, I'm breaking the rules  
If I can glue em back together  
Cannot say, I'm breaking the rules  
If I can glue them back together  
Cannot say, I'm breaking the rules  
If I can glue them back together!  
Back together!  
  
[Chorus: X2]  
Scars on my fingers, bruises on neck  
Crashin' my trains, warship my wreck  
Scars on my fingers, bruises my neck  
Crashin' my trains, warship my wreck  
Scars on my fingers, bruises my neck  
Crashin' my trains, warship my wreck  
warship my wreck!  
warship my wreck!  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Cut the hands off  
Then kamikaze into your soul  
Kamikaze into your soul...  
  
[Chorus: X2]  
Scars on my fingers, bruises my neck  
Crashin' my trains, warship my wreck  
Warship my Wreck!  
Scars on my fingers, bruises my neck  
Crashin' my trains, warship my wreck  
Warship my wreck!  
Scars on my fingers, bruises my neck  
Crashin' my trains, warship my wreck  
warship my wreck!  
  
Scars on my fingers, bruises my neck  
Crashin' my trains, warship my wreck  
  
Cannot say, I'm breaking the rules  
If I can glue em back together  
Cannot say, I'm breaking the rules  
If I can glue them back together  
Cannot say, I'm breaking the rules  
If I can glue them back together!

[I wanted her all over me, so I cut her up and I smeared her]  
Smack dab flat on my back  
The solid ground began to crack  
I pulled her down and down and down  
I lost my breath  
I thought I'd drown  
Fistfuls of you  
Fistfuls of you  
You pulled me through with white knuckles  
Fistfuls of you  
Fistfuls of you  
You pulled me through with white knuckles  
Her leg, my hand, a smoldering brand  
Sticking to her wet body like sand  
Her place, distaste, we fell from grace  
Red smears across her face  
Fistfuls of you  
Fistfuls of you  
You pulled me through with white knuckles  
Fistfuls of you  
Fistfuls of you  
You pulled me through with white knuckles  
White knuckles!  
White knuckles!  
White knuckles!  
White knuckles!  

Virgins sold in quantity  
"African" American heredity  
I'm playin' my guitar and I'm feelin' fine  
Why are all the "niggers" in the unemployment line?  
  
White Trash get down on your knees  
Time for cake and sodomy  
White Trash get down on your knees  
Time for cake and sodomy  
  
Teenage girl, a teenage queen  
Until she's on video  
A porno queen  
She likes to give head  
She likes it mean  
That's why she's my little queen  
White Trash! get down on your knees  
Time for cake and sodomy  
White Trash get down on your knees  
It's time for cake and sodomy  
Yeah....  
  
White boy tryin' to get some behind  
"Who says date rape isn't kind?"  
Where's he gonna go?  
Who's he gonna please?  
It don't matter  
As long as she's on her knees  
  
White Trash get down on your knees  
Time for cake and sodomy  
White Trash get down on your knees  
Time for cake and sodomy

When will realize you're already there?  
So watered down your feelings have turned to mud.  
"Love everybody" is destroying the value of  
All hate has got me nowhere  
  
I know I'm slipping I know I'm slipping I know I'm slipping away  
Oh no it is everything they said it was  
Oh no I am everything they said I was  
When you you get to heaven you will wish you you're in hell  
  
When will you realize you're already here  
You'll think us now that you have crossed over  
Don't pick the scabs or you will never heal  
The world shudders as the worm gets its wings  
  
Then I got my wings and I never even knew it  
When I was a worm, thought I wouldn't get through it
