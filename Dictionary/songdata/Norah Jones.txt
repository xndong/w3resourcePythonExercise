He's got a broken voice and a twisted smile  
Guess he's been that way for quite awhile  
Got blood on his shoes and mud on his brim  
Did he do it to himself, or was it done to him?  
  
People think he don't look well  
But all he needs from what I can tell  
Is someone to help wash away all the paint  
From his purple hands before it gets too late  
  
I saw him stand alone under a broken street light  
So sincere, singing silent night  
But the trees were full, and the grass was green  
It was the sweetest thing I had ever seen  
  
He may move slow  
But that don't mean he's going nowhere  
He may be moving slow  
But that don't mean he's going nowhere

The plot begins with you  
And me in darklit rooms  
Your cigarette cuts through  
I wear it like perfume  
  
The melody gives way  
We silently behave  
The story never read  
Is torn up into shreds  
I see it in your eyes  
The invitation lies  
But pages left to turn  
Our chapters we should burn  
  
The melody gives way  
We silently behave  
The story never read  
Is torn up into shreds  
  
I see it in your eyes  
The invitation lies  
But pages left to turn  
Our chapters we should burn

You made a mess inside  
You could not hide your pride  
You never held my hand  
And I'll never understand  
Why I can't stop loving you  
And I won't stop trying to  
  
I go out every night  
Can't seem to pick a fight  
Never have found your eyes  
Out in the crowded skies  
  
And I can't stop fighting you  
But I won't stop trying to  
'Cause your voice keeps spinning 'round my head at night  
Making me scream  
  
And I can't stop loving you  
But I won't stop trying  
And I can't stop loving you away  
  
You made a mess inside  
You really hurt my pride  
Why did you have to die?  
Why did you have to die?  
Why did you have to die?

And after all's been said and done  
Who said it best, were you the one?  
Let's just forget, leave it behind  
And carry on  
  
If you should find the time to speak  
Then speak to me, I'd never keep  
You from your final destiny  
So carry on  
Into the quiet unbound  
What you have lost, I've never found  
I lost my nerve, yet peace surrounds  
So carry on  
  
Into the quiet unbound  
What you have lost, I've never found  
I lost my nerve, yet peace surrounds  
So carry on  
  
And now that all's been said and done  
Who said it best, were you the one?  
Let's just forget, leave it behind  
And carry on  
Let's just forget, leave it behind  
And carry on

Comes a rainstorm, put your rubbers on your feet  
Comes a snowstorm, you can get a little heat  
Comes love, nothing can be done  
Comes a fire, then you know just what to do  
Blow a tire, you can get another shoe  
Comes love, nothing can be done  
  
Don't try hiding, 'cause there isn't any use  
You will start sliding, when your heart turns on the juice  
Comes a headache, you can lose it in a day  
Comes a toothache, see your dentist right away  
Comes love, nothing can be done  
  
That's all brother, if you ever been in love  
That's all brother, you know just what I'm speaking of  
Comes a nightmare, you can always stay awake  
Comes depression, you may get another break  
Comes love, nothing can be done

There's a big ol' hole  
That's gone right through the sole  
Of this old shoe  
And the water on the ground  
Ain't got no place else it found  
So it's only got one thing left to do  
  
Creep on in  
Creep on in  
And once it has begun  
Won't stop until it's done  
Sneaking in  
  
There's a silver moon  
That came just a little soon  
  
For me to bare  
Shines brightly on my bed  
And the shadows overhead  
Won't let me sleep as long as they're there  
  
Creep on in  
Creep on in  
And once it has beguun  
Won't stop until it'd done  
Sneaking in  
  
There's a big ol' hole  
That goes right through my sole  
And that ain't nothing new  
So long as you're around  
And got no place else you've found  
There's only one thing left to do  
  
Creep on in  
Creep on in  
And once you have begun  
Don't stop until you're done  
Sneaking in

When the day is done  
Down to earth then sinks the sun  
Along with everything that was lost and won  
When the day is done  
  
When the day is done  
Hope so much your race will be all run  
Then you find you jumped the gun  
Have to go back where you began  
When the day is done  
  
When the night is cold  
Some get by but some get old  
Just to show life's not made of gold  
When the night is cold.  
  
When the bird has flown

I waited 'til I saw the sun  
I don't know why I didn't come  
I left you by the house of fun  
I don't know why I didn't come  
I don't know why I didn't come  
  
When I saw the break of day  
I wished that I could fly away  
Instead of kneeling in the sand  
Catching teardrops in my hand  
  
My heart is drenched in wine  
But you'll be on my mind  
Forever  
  
Out across the endless sea  
I would die in ecstasy  
But I'll be a bag of bones  
Driving down the road alone  
  
My heart is drenched in wine  
But you'll be on my mind  
Forever  
  
Something has to make you run  
I don't know why I didn't come  
I feel as empty as a drum  
I don't know why I didn't come  
I don't know why I didn't come

It brings a tear  
Into my eyes  
When I begin  
To realize  
I've cried so much  
Since you've been gone  
I guess  
I'm drowning  
In my own tears  
  
I sit and cry  
Just like a child  
My pouring tears  
Are runnin' wild  
If you don't think  
You'll be home soon  
I guess I'll drown  
In my own tears  
  
I know it's true  
Into each life  
Some rain  
Rain must pour  
I'm so blue  
Here without you  
It keeps raining  
More and more  
  
Why don't you  
Come on home  
Oh yes, so I won't  
Be all alone  
If you don't think  
You'll be home soon  
  
I guess I'll  
(Drown in my own tears)  
Ooh, don't let me  
(Drown in my own tears)  
When I'm in trouble, baby  
(Drown in my own tears)  
Oh, yeah  
Baby don't let me  
(Drown in my own tears)  
I guess I'll drown  
In my own tears  
Oh, mmmmm

Something about the way he touched me.  
Was so slow, the way he put his arms around me.  
Even though I'm feeling lonely,  
I'm, I'm feeling lonely.  
  
Don't understand the words he said,  
Made me do wrong.  
But now there's nothing that's in my head  
And though it's strong, I wish he'd leave me alone,  
I wish he'd leave me  
  
'Cause I know, trouble will follow  
But I have to go  
I have to go  
  
'Cause I know, trouble will follow  
But I have to go  
But I have to go  
  
He makes me think that I don't know me  
So I'll show him what I remember all the things he showed me  
And I want more,  
I'm feeling lonely  
Oh, I'm feeling lonely

My words are lazy  
My thoughts are hazy  
But this is one thing I'm sure of  
Everybody needs a best friend  
I'm happy I'm yours  
  
You got a double  
Who brings you trouble  
And though you're better without me  
Everybody needs a best friend  
I'm happy I'm yours  
  
A fool could see decidedly  
That you're a ten and I'm a three  
A royal brie is what you need  
So how did you come to be stuck with a bummer like me  
  
Oh you got a... Full of dreadful  
And yet lest that someone adores you  
Everybody needs a best friend  
I'm happy I'm yours  
  
A fool could see decidedly  
That you're a ten and I'm a three  
A royal brie is what you need  
So how did you come to be stuck with a bummer like me

The sun just slipped its note below my door  
And I can't hide beneath my sheets  
I've read the words before so now I know  
The time has come again for me  
  
And I'm feelin' the same way all over again  
Feelin' the same way all over again  
Singin' the same lines all over again  
No matter how much I pretend  
  
Another day that I can't find my head  
My feet don't look like they're my own  
I'll try and find the floor below to stand  
And I hope I reach it once again  
  
And I'm feelin' the same way all over again  
Feelin' the same way all over again  
Singin' the same lines all over again  
No matter how much I pretend  
  
Yeah, oh, yeah  
  
So many times I wonder where I've gone  
And how I found my way back in  
I look around awhile for something lost  
Maybe I'll find it in the end  
  
And I'm feelin' the same way all over again  
Feelin' the same way all over again  
Singin' the same lines all over again  
No matter how much I pretend  
  
Feelin' the same way all over again  
Feelin' the same way all over again  
Singin' the same lines all over again  
No matter how much I pretend  
No matter how much I pretend

[Verse 1]  
I tried to get high, but you wanted me low  
Good things are happening, but happening slow  
It's some kind of mystery from long ago  
  
I finally know who I'm supposed to be  
My mind was locked but I found the key  
Hope it don't all slip away from me  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Hard times, fun lines  
Moments pass by and I cry  
Rewind, step behind  
It's hard to find the flipside  
  
[Chorus]  
I can't stand when you tell me to get back  
If we're all free, then why does it seem we can't just be?  
  
[Verse 2]  
You saw your reflection all over the news  
Your temperature's well past a hundred and two  
Put the guns away, or we'll all gonna lose  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Stand by, or take flight  
Eat or throw your piece pie  
Walk on, or be mine  
Moments fly by and I cry  
  
[Chorus]  
I can't stand when you tell me to get back  
If we're all free, then why does it seem we can't just be?  
I can't stand when you tell me to get back  
If we're all free, then why does it seem we can't just be?

Trying to pick up the pace  
Trying to make it so I never see your face again  
Trying to throw this away  
Want to make sure that you never waste my time again  
  
How does it feel?  
Oh how does it feel  
To be you right now dear?  
You brought this upon  
So pick up your piece and go away from here  
  
Please just let me go now  
Please just let me go  
Would you please just let me go now?  
Please just let me go  
  
I'm going to get you out  
I'm going to get you out  
I'm going to get you out of my head,  
Get out  
  
I'm going to get you out  
I'm going to get you out  
I'm going to get you out of my head,  
Get out  
  
Never said we'd be friends,  
Trying to keep myself away from you,  
'Cause you're bad, bad news  
  
With you gone, I'm alive,  
Makes me feel like I took happy pills,  
And time stood still  
  
How does it feel?  
Oh how does it feel to be the one shut out?  
You broke all the rules  
I won't be a fool for you no more my dear  
  
Please just let me go now  
Please just let me go  
Would you please just let me go now?  
Please just let me go  
  
I'm going to get you out  
I'm going to get you out  
I'm going to get you out of my head  
Get out  
  
I'm going to get you out  
I'm going to get you out  
I'm going to get you out of my head  
Get out

Heart of mine, be still  
You can play with fire but you'll get the bill  
Don't let him know, don't let him know that you love him  
Oh, don't be a fool, don't be blind heart of mine  
Heart of mine, go back home  
You've got no reason to wander, no reason to roam  
Don't let him see, don't let him see that you need him  
Oh, don't put yourself over the line heart of mine  
Heart of mine, go back where you've been  
The only trouble for you is if you let him in  
Don't let him hear, don't let him hear where you're going  
Oh, untie the ties that bind heart of mine  
Heart of mine so malicious and so full of guile  
I give you an inch and you take a mile  
Don't let yourself fall, don't let yourself stumble  
Oh, do the time, don't do the crime heart of mine  
Heart of mine  
Heart of mine  

Went out on a limb  
Gone too far  
I broke down at the side of the road  
Stranded at the outskirts and sun's creepin' up  
  
Baby's in the backseat  
Still fast asleep  
Dreamin' of better days  
I don't want to call you but you're all I have to turn to  
  
What do you say  
When it's all gone away  
Baby I didn't mean to hurt you  
The truth spoke in whispers will tear you apart  
No matter how hard you resist it  
It never rains when you want it to  
  
You humble me lord  
Humble me lord  
I'm on my knees empty  
You humble me lord  
You humble me lord  
So please please please forgive me  
  
Baby teresa, she's got your eyes  
I see you all the time  
When she asks about her daddy  
I never know what to say  
  
Heard you kicked the bottle  
And helped to build the church  
You carry an honest wage  
Is it true you have someone keeping you company  
  
What do you say  
When it's all gone away  
Baby I didn't mean to hurt you  
Truth spoke in whispers will tear you apart  
No matter how hard you resist it  
It never rains when you want it to  
  
You humble me lord  
Humble me lord  
I'm on my knees empty  
You humble me lord  
You humble me lord  
So please please forgive me  
  
You humble me

My story is much  
To sad to be told  
But practically everything  
Leaves me totally cold  
The only exception  
I know is the case  
When I'm out on a quiet spree  
Fighting vainly the old ennui  
Then I suddenly turn and see  
Your fabulous face  
  
Chorus:  
  
I get no kick from champagne  
Mere alcohol  
Doesn't thrill me at all  
  
So tell me why  
Should it be true?  
That I get a  
Kick out of you  
  
(Some like the perfume from Spain)  
(I'm sure  
That if I took even one sniff)  
(It would bore me terrifically too)  
(But I get a kick out of you)  
  
(Some like the bop-type refrain)  
(I'm sure that if  
I heard even one riff)  
(It would bore me terrifically too)  
(But I get a kick out of you)  
  
(Some they may go for cocaine)  
(I'm sure that if  
I took even one sniff)  
(It would bore me  
Terrifically too)  
(But I get a kick out of you)  
  
I get a kick every time  
I see you  
Standing there before me  
I get a kick though  
It's clear to see  
You obviously do not adoreme  
  
I get no kick in a plane  
Flying too high  
With some gal in the sky  
Is my idea of nothing to do  
But I get a kick out of you

If I touched myself  
The way you touched me  
If I could hold myself  
The way you held me  
  
[Chorus]  
Then I wouldn't need you  
I wouldn't need you  
No, I wouldn't need you  
To love me  
  
If I could replace  
The things you gave me  
If I could see my face  
Without the tragedy  
  
[Chorus]  
  
But I do  
So come back  
Come back  
  
If you could see the way I act  
When I'm alone  
If you could hear my voice crack  
Over the phone  
  
Oh and I need you  
Oh and I need you  
To love me

Close your eyes, close the door  
You don't have to worry any more  
'Cause I'll be your baby tonight  
Shut the lights and shut the shade  
You don't have to be afraid  
'Cause I'll be your baby tonight  
Well, that mockingbird's gonna sail away  
We're gonna forget it  
That big fat moon  
Is gonna shine like a spoon  
But we're gonna let it  
You won't regret it  
Kick your shoes off  
And don't you fear  
Bring that bottle over here  
'Cause I'll be your baby tonight  
Well, that mockingbird's gonna sail away  
We're gonna forget it  
That big fat moon  
Is gonna shine like a spoon  
But we're gonna let it  
You won't regret it  
Kick your shoes off  
And don't you fear  
Bring that bottle over here  
'Cause I'll be your baby tonight  
'Cause I'll be your baby tonight  
'Cause I'll be your baby tonight, tonight  

In the dark  
It's just you and I  
Not a sound  
There's not one sigh  
Just the beat of my poor heart  
In the dark  
  
Now in the dark, in the dark  
I get such a thrill  
When he presses his fingertips  
Upon my lips  
And he begs me to please keep still  
In the dark  
  
But soon  
This dance will be endin'  
And you're gonna be missed  
Gee, I'm not pretendin'  
'Cause I swear it's fun  
Fun to be kissed  
  
In the dark  
Now we will find  
What the rest  
Have left behind  
Just let them dance  
We're gonna find romance  
Lord, in the dark

It starts with one  
One thing I don't know why  
It doesn't even matter how hard you try  
Keep that in mind as I designed this rhyme to explain in due time  
All I know  
Time is a valuable thing  
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings  
Watch it count down to the end of the day  
The clock ticks life away  
It's so unreal  
You didn't look out below  
Watch the time go right out the window  
Trying to hold on but you didn't even know  
I wasted it all just to watch you go  
Kept everything inside  
And even though I tried  
It all fell apart  
What it meant to be will eventually be a memory of a time  
  
I tried so hard  
And got so far  
But in the end  
It doesn't even matter  
I had to fall to lose it all  
But in the end it doesn't even matter  
  
One thing  
I don't know why  
It doesn't even matter how hard you try  
Keep that in mind as I designed this rhyme  
To remind myself how I tried so hard  
In spite of the way you were mocking me  
Actin like I was part of your property  
Remembering all the times you've fought with me  
I'm surpirsed it got so far  
Things arent the way they were before  
You wouldnt even recognize me anymore  
Not that you knew me back then but it all comes back to me in the end  
I kept everything inside and even though I tried  
It all fell apart  
What it meant to be will evenutally be a memory of a time  
  
I tried so hard  
And got so far  
But in the end  
It doesn't even matter  
I had to fall to lose it all  
But in the end it doesn't even matter  
  
I put my trust in you  
Pushed as far as I could go  
For all this there's only one thing you should know  
I put my trust in you  
Pushed as far as I could go  
For all this  
There's only one thing you should know  
  
I tried so hard and got so far  
But in the end it doesn't even matter  
I had to fall to lose it all  
But in the end  
It doesn't even matter  
  
Repeat til end

I can't stop myself from calling  
calling out your name  
I can't stop myself from falling  
falling back again  
in the morning,  
Baby, in the afternoon  
  
Dark like the shady corner  
inside a violin  
Hot like to burn my lips  
I know I can't win  
in the morning  
Baby, in the afternoon  
  
I try to quit you but I'm too weak  
waking up without you  
I can hardly speak at all  
  
My girlfriend tried to help me  
get you off my mind  
She tried a little tea and sympathy  
to help me to unwind  
in the morning  
Baby, in the afternoon  
  
Funny how my favorite shirt  
smells more like you than me  
Bitter traces left behind  
in stains no one can see  
in the morning  
Baby, in the afternoon  
  
You're gonna put me in an early grave  
I know I'm your slave whenever you call  
  
I can't stop myself from calling  
calling out your name  
I can't stop myself from falling  
falling back again  
falling back again  
in the morning  
Baby, in the afternoon

[Verse]  
It's a wonderful time for love  
It's a wonderful time for love  
Sun shines down from above  
  
It's a wonderful time for love  
And you think you have all you dreamed of  
But all the great blue skies just ain't enough  
[Chorus]  
When the sun goes down  
We sleep safe and sound  
A wonderful time for love  
Time for dealing a different game  
One where we don't have to place the blame  
  
[Chorus]  
How much can we bear?  
If pain is all we share  
A wonderful time for love  
Such a beautiful time to rise  
And walk away from all the endless lies  
And try to see the world through other eyes

If all we talk about is money  
Nothing will be funny, honey  
And now that everyone's a critic  
It's makin' my mascara runny  
If we only talk about the "Heathers"  
Making it together, is crazy  
If we don't get a new situation  
For our busted nation, we're lazy  
  
But it's gonna be  
It's gonna be  
Please make it be  
It's gonna be  
  
Now if a princess becomes human  
Don't stone her on a talk show, you'll ruin  
Cause there's a fine line between a skewer  
And a decent sense of humor  
Aim at the ones who've really hurt us  
They should be arrested for murders  
But then all the cameras were turned on  
Some skinny naked blond eating burgers  
  
But it's gonna be  
It's gonna be  
It's gonna be  
It's gonna be  
  
It's gonna be  
It's gonna be  
Please make it be  
Let's make it be  
  
It's gonna be  
It's gonna be  
It's gonna be  
Be, be, be, be

While love seasons will undo your soul  
Time forgives us and it takes control  
We separate our things to put us back together  
  
We're light as a feather  
Heavy as the weather  
If it was rainstorms  
  
Put our hands together to plough obey  
It's like a show was over  
But we're too scared to walk away  
All for the better  
Worst for the way  
  
We're light as a feather  
Got you and I together  
  
Meanwhile inside of me it was rainin' storms, hm,  
You didn't know, hm  
God bless your soul  
  
We're light as a feather  
Heavy as the weather  
We're light as a feather  
Got you and I together

Little broken hearts of the night  
Slowly picking up their knives  
On the way to the fight  
Tonight they want revenge  
  
Beautiful soldiers in their beds  
Making love inside their hands  
With no chance to defend  
Tonight could be their end  
  
With the weapons in their hands  
And their eyes closed as they stand  
Can they end it all tonight so easily?  
  
Did the darkness of their days  
Make them let go of their light?  
Will they want to find a way  
To make it all right?  
  
When the beautiful awake  
See the sadness in their eyes  
Will they want to find a way  
To make it all right  
To make it all right?  
  
Only the fallen need to rise  
What if lightning strikes them twice?  
Will they give up on their lives  
And finally divide?  
  
Did the darkness of their days  
Make them let go of their light?  
Can they ever find a way  
To sleep side by side?  
  
When the beautiful awake  
See the sadness in their eyes  
Will they ever find a way  
To sleep side by side  
To sleep side by side  
To sleep side by side?

You and me, and  
Me and you  
In my little room  
There's room enough for us to do  
The things we like to do  
  
Oops, I hit my elbow on the doorknob  
It's right there  
It's by the bed next to my head  
But I don't even care  
  
There's stars up on the wall  
And they all glow in the dark  
And we can hear the children playing  
Outside in the park  
  
There's bars on the window  
And if there were a fire  
We'd burn up for sure  
But that's just fine by me 'cause  
We would be together ever more  
  
In this little room  
In the big city we're so far  
From the people that we knew in  
My big ol' blue car  
  
But if we stick together  
Then I know we'll be okay  
'Cause when it gets too cold outside  
This room is where we'll stay

Lonestar where are you out tonight?  
This feeling I'm trying to fight  
It's dark and I think that I would  
Give anything  
For you to shine down on me  
  
How far you are I just don't know  
The distance I'm willing to go  
I pick up a stone that I cast to the sky  
Hoping for some kind of sign  
  
Lonestar where are you out tonight?  
This feeling I'm trying to fight  
It's dark and I think that I would  
Give anything  
For you to shine down on me  
For you to shine down on me

'Twas Halloween, and the ghosts were out  
And everywhere they'd go, they shout  
And though I covered my eyes, I knew  
They'd go away  
  
But fear's the only thing I saw  
And three days later 'twas clear to all  
That nothing is as scary as election day  
  
But the day after is darker  
And darker and darker it goes  
Who knows, maybe the plans will change  
Who knows, maybe he's not deranged  
  
The news men know what they know, but they  
Know even less than what they say  
And I don't know who I can trust  
For they come what may  
  
'Cause we believed in our candidate  
But even more it's the one we hate  
I needed someone I could shake  
On election day  
  
But the day after is darker  
And deeper and deeper we go  
Who knows, maybe it's all a dream  
Who knows if I'll wake up and scream  
  
I love the things that you've given me  
I cherish you, my dear country  
But sometimes I don't understand  
The way we play  
  
I love the things that you've given me  
And most of all that I am free  
To have a song that I can sing  
On election day

I can't remember what I planned tomorrow  
I can't remember when it's time to go  
When I look in the mirror  
Tracing lines with a pencil  
I remember what came before  
  
I wanted to think there was endless love  
Until I saw the light dim in your eyes  
In the dead of the night I found out  
Sometimes there's love that won't survive  
  
New York City  
Such a beautiful disease  
New York City  
Such a beautiful,  
Such a beautiful disease  
  
Laura kept all her disappointments  
Locked up in a box behind her closet door  
She pulled the blinds and listened to the thunder  
With no way out from the family store  
  
We all told her things could get better  
When you just say goodbye  
I'll lay awake one more night  
Caught in a vision I want to deny  
  
And did I mention the note that I found  
Taped to my locked front door  
It talked about no regrets  
As it slipped from my hand to the scuffed tile floor  
  
I rode the train for hours on end  
And watched the people pass me by  
It could be that it has no end  
Just an action junkie's lullaby  
  
New York City  
We were full of the stuff that every dream rested  
As if floating on a lumpy pillow sky  
Caught up in the whole illusion  
That dreams never pass us by  
Came to a tattooed conclusion  
That the big one was knocking on the door  
What started as a mass delusion  
Would take me far from the place I adore  
  
New York City

She's twenty two  
And she's loving you  
And you'll never know how it makes me blue  
Does it make you happy?  
  
I'm holding on  
To a thing that's wrong  
'Cause we don't belong  
But you like my songs  
And you make me happy  
Does she make you happy?  
  
You can throw away  
Every word I say  
  
I'm standing still  
On this hidden hill  
And I'm looking around  
For the right way down  
To your distant valley  
  
Your flowers grow in the frozen snow  
And I'd like to know if it's all a show  
'Cause you sure look happy  
Are you really happy?  
  
You'll just throw away  
Every word I say  
You can throw away, ay ay  
  
Oh oh  
  
Does she make you happy?  
Does she make you happy?  
Does she make you happy?  
I'd like to see you happy

We're an oyster cracker on the stew  
And the honey in the tea  
We're the sugar cubes, one lump or two  
In the black coffee  
The golden crust on an apple pie  
That shines in the sun at noon  
We're a wheel of cheese high in the sky  
But we're gonna be sinkin' soon  
  
In a boat that's built of sticks and hay  
We drifted from the shore  
With a captain who's too proud to say  
That he dropped the oar  
Now a tiny hole has sprung a leak  
In this cheap pontoon  
Now the hull has started growing weak  
And we're gonna be sinkin' soon  
  
We're gonna be  
Sinkin' soon  
We're gonna be  
Sinkin' soon  
Everybody hold your breath 'cause  
We're gonna be sinkin' soon  
  
We're gonna be  
Sinkin' soon  
We're gonna be  
Sinkin' soon  
Everybody hold your breath 'cause  
Down and down we go  
  
Like the oyster cracker on the stew  
The honey in the tea  
The sugar cubes, one lump or two?  
No thank you, none for me  
We're the golden crust on an apple pie  
That shines in the sun at noon  
Like the wheel of cheese high in the sky  
Well, we're gonna be sinkin' soon

Somewhere over the rainbow  
Way up high,  
And the dreams that you've dreamed of  
Once in a lullaby.  
  
Somewhere over the rainbow  
Bluebirds fly,  
And the dreams that you've dreamed of  
Dreams really do come true.  
  
Someday i'll wish upon a star  
And wake up where the clouds are far  
Behind me.  
Where troubles melts like lemon drops  
Away above the chimney tops  
That's where you'll find me.  
  
Somewhere over the rainbow  
Bluebirds fly.  
And the dreams that you dare to..  
Oh why, oh why can't i?  
  
Well, I see  
Trees of green and red roses too,  
I'll watch them bloom for me and you  
And I think to myself,  
What a wonderful world.  
  
Well I see,  
Skies of blues and, clouds of white,  
And the brightness of day, I like the dark  
And I think to myself,  
What a wonderful world.  
  
The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky  
Are also on the faces of people passing by  
I see friends shaking hands saying how do you do  
They're really saying i... I love you.  
  
I hear babies cry, I watch them grow  
They'll learn much more than really know  
And I think to myself  
What a wonderful world.  
  
Someday i'll wish upon a star  
And wake up where the clouds are far  
Behind me.  
Where troubles melt like lemon drops  
Away above the chimney tops  
That's where you'll find me.  
  
Somewhere over the rainbow  
Way up high,  
And the dreams that you dare to  
Oh why, oh why can't i?

I believe, you say  
Don't think, we'll stay  
Drawn through the ebb  
Lost in the flow  
Beneath my breath, I confess  
My world, loved less  
The devil held the proof  
For me to know  
I could only fight  
For the longest while  
But with the truth out, baby  
I belong to you  
I stoop to find  
My place, entwined  
I took it to the bottom  
One more time  
I could only fight  
For the longest while  
But with the truth out, baby  
I belong to you  
I could trip and I want you to know  
That every time I think  
That I think I should go  
I receive strange transmissions  
I could trip and I want you to know  
That every time I think  
That I think I should go  
I receive strange transmissions  
I could only fight  
For the longest while  
But with the truth out, baby  
I belong to you  
I could trip and I want you to know  
That every time I think  
That I think I should go  
I receive strange transmissions  
I could trip and I want you to know  
Every time I think  
That I think I should go  
I receive strange transmissions  

You shove your way  
Through the room from the street  
And finally to me  
You ask me what I'm drinking  
  
My friend Johnny  
Tugging on my sleeve  
Asks if I wanna leave  
But what I'm really thinking is  
  
Why can't it be easy  
Easy  
Why don't you leave  
Leave me  
Leave me be  
I can see you swaying  
I can't hear what you're saying  
  
I'm sitting here stuck  
And plastered to my seat  
I think up a reason to leave  
When you finally stop speaking  
I'll take a long slow  
Walk down Washington Street  
Half asleep on my feet  
Half aware if I'm dreaming  
  
I'll go home alone  
A sinking stone  
A switched off telephone  
I'll go on and be free  
A frozen breeze  
A fallen down factory  
But I still see you swaying  
And I can't hear what you're saying  
  
I just lost the plot  
Got a little caught  
In a little knot  
I just hit a wall  
Had a little fall  
Felt the swinging wrecking ball  
  
And why should that be  
Why don't you tell me  
Why don't you tell me  
I'm sure you'll tell me  
Why don't you tell me  
I guess you'll tell me  
Tell me

Sunrise, sunrise  
Looks like morning in your eyes  
But the clocks held 9:15 for hours  
Sunrise, sunrise  
Couldn't tempt us if it tried  
'Cause the afternoon's already come and gone  
And i said ooh, ooh, ooh, to you  
  
Surprise, surprise  
Couldn't find it in your eyes  
But I'm sure it's written all over my face  
  
Surprise, surprise  
Never something I could hide  
When I see we made it through another day  
  
Then I say, oh, oh, oh, to you  
  
And now the night  
Will throw its cover down on me again  
Oh, and if I'm right  
It's the only way to bring me back  
  
Oh, oh, oh, to you  
Oh, oh, oh, to you

I was dancin' with my baby to the Tennessee Waltz  
When an old friend I just happened to see  
I introduced her to my loved one  
And while they were dancin'  
My friend stole my sweetheart from me  
I remember the night and the Tennessee Waltz  
And I knew just how much I had lost  
I have lost my little darlin'  
The night they were playing  
The beautiful Tennessee Waltz  
I remember the night and the Tennessee Waltz  
And I knew just how much I had lost  
I have lost my little darlin'  
The night they were playing  
The beautiful beautiful Tennessee Waltz  
The Tennessee Waltz

I know a guy  
That's got a lot to lose  
He's a pretty nice guy  
But he's kind of confused  
He's got muscles in his head  
That ain't never been used  
Thinks he own half of this town  
  
Starts drinking heavy  
Gets a big red nose  
Beats his old lady  
With a rubber hose  
Then he takes her out to dinner  
And buys her new clothes  
That's the way that the world goes 'round.  
  
That's the way that the world goes 'round  
You're up one day  
And the next you're down  
It's half an inch of water  
And you think you're gonna drown  
That's the way that the world goes 'round.  
  
I was sitting in the bathtub  
Counting my toes  
When the radiator broke  
Water all froze  
I got stuck in the ice  
Without my clothes  
Naked as the eyes of a clown  
  
I was crying ice cubes  
Hoping I'd croak  
When the sun come through the window  
The ice all broke  
I stood up and laughed  
Thought it was a joke  
That's the way that the world goes 'round

I've had to think up a way to survive  
Since you said it's over  
Told me good-bye  
I just can't make it one day without you  
Unless I pretend that the opposite's true  
Rivers flow backwards  
Valleys are high  
Mountains are level  
Truth is a lie  
I'm perfectly fine  
And I don't miss you  
The sky is green  
And the grass is blue  
  
How much can a heart and a troubled mind take  
Where is that fine line before it all breaks  
Can one end their sorrow  
Just cross over it  
And into that realm of insanitive bliss  
  
There's snow in the tropics  
There's ice on the sun  
It's hot in the arctic  
And crying is fun  
And I'm happy now  
And I'm glad we're through  
And the sky is green  
And the grass is blue  
  
And the rivers flow backwards  
And my tears are dry  
Swans hate the water  
And eagles can't fly  
But I'm alright now  
Now that I'm over you  
And the sky is green  
And the grass is blue  
And I don't love you  
And the grass is blue

The prettiest thing  
I ever did see  
Was lightning from the top of a cloud  
Moving through the dark a million miles an hour  
With somewhere to be  
  
So why does it seem  
Like a picture  
Hanging up on someone else's wall  
Lately I just haven't been myself at all  
It's heavy on my mind  
  
I'm dreamin' again  
Like I've always been  
And way down low  
I know  
  
The prettiest thing  
I ever did see  
Was dusty as the handle on the door  
Rusty as a nail stuck in the old pine floor  
Looks like home to me  
  
I'm dreamin' again  
Like I've always been  
And way down low  
I'm thinkin' of the prettiest thing

Well I said from the first  
That I, I'm the worst kind of guy  
For you to be around  
Tear me apart  
Including this old heart  
That is true  
And never ever let you down  
You should'nt stick with me  
You trust me too much, you see  
Take all the pain  
It's yours anyway  
Get out kid  
Oh put the blame on me  
You ought to pass, you see  
Oh somewhere outside  
I threw  
Love aside  
And now  
It's a tragedy  
I said from the first  
That I, I'm the worst kind of guy  
For you to be around

The current is strong from what I've heard  
I'll whisk you down the stream  
But I never seem to have the time  
So my toes just touch the water  
So my toes just touch the water  
  
Daydreamed on the bank again  
I was swimming with the fish  
And I thought this time that it may be true  
But my toes just touched the water [Repeat: x3]  
  
Walked a mile just to find the edge  
Some place low enough  
to step right in  
Now I'm here and I can't begin  
to move  
  
Walked a mile just to find the edge  
Some place low enough  
to step right in  
Now I'm here and I can't begin  
to move  
  
That spoiled sun up over there  
Always has to have its way  
And I know that the river's there to shelter me  
But my toes just touched the water [Repeat: x3]

[Intro]  
It's a tragedy  
It's a tragedy  
It's a tragedy  
It's a tragedy  
  
[Verse 1]  
He was only 25  
Had an open heart and tender mind  
He sang through all the hymns he knew  
He was searching for a higher sign  
When his water was turned to wine  
All the darkness became light  
Babies and a patient wife  
They just weren't enough to keep him high  
So he gave them up  
Just to fill his cup  
Every sip would make him feel alive  
No bones in his body were dry  
  
[Chorus]  
It's a tragedy  
It's a tragedy  
It's a tragedy  
It's a tragedy  
  
[Verse 2]  
Now he's finally coming around  
He's got wrinkles and a crooked frown  
He holds back tears thinking of the years  
That the bottle had a long time, down  
So he'd sit and have another round  
Singing Hallelujah till he drowns  
  
[Chorus]  
It's a tragedy  
It's a tragedy  
It's a tragedy  
It's a tragedy  
It's a tragedy  
It's a tragedy  
It's a tragedy  
It's a tragedy

Like a flower, waiting to bloom  
Like a lightbulb, in a dark room  
I'm just sittin' here waiting for you  
To come on home and turn me on  
  
Like the desert waiting for the rain  
Like a school kid waiting for the spring  
I'm just sitting here waiting for you  
To come on home and turn me on  
  
My poor heart, its been so dark  
Since you've been gone  
After all you're the one who turns me off  
But you're the only one who can turn me back on  
  
My Hi-fi is waiting for a new tune  
My glass is waiting for some fresh ice cubes  
I'm just sitting here waiting for you  
To come on home and turn me on, turn me on

You've got a famous last name  
But you're not to blame  
Baby, I see you for who you are  
  
A one-time apple queen  
And a one-time tramp  
And an old-time movie star  
  
You're a shell picker  
Of the pickiest kind  
But you always find the ones to keep  
  
And in or out of bed  
You keep you're head wide open  
'Cause ya don't only dream when you're asleep  
  
Like a child, you remember  
But I forget all my dreams  
  
I used to think  
That someday I'd relax a little  
And be more like you  
  
Then I realized  
How silly that thought was  
Needed to stand in my own shoes  
  
And from over here  
I can see you cry  
Don't even try to pretend  
  
'Cause he's hurt you  
So many times  
Baby, don't go back again  
  
Like a child, you forget  
But I remember everything and every sting  
  
And through all the games  
We'll both stay the same  
As we've always been  
Through the fat and thin  
Until the end  
Until the end

Hush now watch the stars fall  
Into a fire wall  
I am waiting here  
Waiting for you to come home  
  
Sinking embers glow  
Melting icy snow  
I am waiting here,  
Waiting for you to come home  
Hm, hm  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
And I watch them burn  
When will I ever learn  
If I wait it doesn't mean  
You will return  
  
Now all the stars have gone  
Faded into cracks of dawn  
And I'm still waiting here  
Waiting for you to come home, hm, hm  
  
I'm waiting here  
Waiting for you to come home, hm, hm

Wake me up when it's over  
Wake me up when it's done  
When he's gone away and taken everything  
Wake me up  
  
Wake me up when the skies are clearing  
When the water is still  
'Cause I will not watch the ships sail away, so  
Please say you will  
  
If it were any other day  
This wouldn't get the best of me  
  
But today I'm not so strong  
So lay me down with a sad song  
And when it stops, then you know I've been  
Gone too long  
  
But don't shake me awake  
Don't bend me or I will break  
Come find me somewhere between my dreams  
With the sun on my face  
  
I will still feel it later on  
But for now I'd rather be asleep

What am I to you?  
Tell me darlin' true  
To me you are the sea  
Vast as you can be  
And deep the shade of blue  
  
When you're feelin' low  
To whom else do you go?  
I'd cry if you hurt  
I'd give you my last shirt  
Because I love you so  
  
Now if my sky should fall  
Would you even call?  
I've opened up my heart  
I never want to part  
I'm givin' you the ball  
  
When I look in your eyes  
I can feel the butterflies  
I'll love you when you're blue  
But tell me darlin' true  
What am I to you?  
  
If my sky should fall  
would you even call?  
I've opened up my heart  
I never want to part  
I'm givin' you the ball  
  
When I look in your eyes  
I can feel the butterflies  
Could you find a love in me?  
Would you carve me in a tree?  
Don't fill my heart with lies  
I will love you when you're blue  
But tell me darlin' true  
What am I to you?

Don't decieve me  
Please don't leave me  
What would I do without you  
To see me through  
If you leave me, then you'll grieve me  
What would I do without you  
To see me through  
What would I do  
I wanna know  
What would I do  
Where would I go  
Can you please me  
When you squeeze me  
What would I do, oh, if I, oh  
To see me through  
What would I do  
I wanna know  
What would I do  
Where would I go  
Oh, yes I'm crazy  
'bout my baby, yes I am  
What would I do without you  
To see me through, ohhhh

We met in a place I used to go  
Now I just walk by it for show  
Can't bear to go in without you now  
Wish I could  
Wish I could  
  
But Annie is standing in the door  
With a look on her face I can't just ignore  
She tells me that her heart is sore  
And pulls me in  
She pulls me in  
  
She says, 'love in the time of war is not fair  
He was my man, but they didn't care  
Sent him far away from here  
No goodbye  
No goodbye.'  
  
I don't tell her that I once loved you too  
Or about all the things we used to do  
I kiss her hair, and think of you  
Walking down  
The road you found  
  
We met in a place I used to go  
Now I only walk by it slow  
Can't bear to go in without you now  
Wish I could [Repeat: x4]

It starts off slow  
With a kiss of folly  
And you don't see it  
As more  
But after awhile  
When all the dogs  
See you  
Sneaking  
In the back door  
You don't believe  
When they tell you  
You don't believe  
  
Then  
A world of trouble  
Is all you see  
  
Nights  
When the phone rings  
And it's so easy  
To get up  
And go back again  
You don't stop  
You don't think  
To live without it  
Knowing  
That you'll never win  
You don't believe  
When they tell you  
You don't believe  
  
Then  
A world of trouble  
Is all you see  
  
This is the last time  
Or the beginning  
Whenever you say  
It's enough  
While each day  
Each month  
Rolls out behind you  
The lost time  
Is calling your bluff  
You don't believe  
When they tell you  
You don't believe  
  
Then  
A world of trouble  
Is all you see  
A world of trouble  
Is all you need

Don't want to get over you  
I'm not here to forget you, I'm here to recall  
The things we used to say and do  
I don't want to get over you  
I don't want to get over you  
  
I haunt the same places we used to go  
Alone at a table for two  
I don't want to get over you  
I don't want to get over you  
  
They ought to give me the Wurlitzer prize  
For all the silver I led slide down the slot  
Playing those songs sung blue  
Help me remember you  
I don't want to get over you  
  
A fresh roll of quarters, same old song  
Missing you through and through  
I don't want to get over you  
I don't want to get over you  
  
I don't want to get over you  
I don't want to get over you
