Accepted, highly favored of the Lord  
Forgiven by Your love I am transformed  
It's not what I'll do but what You've done for me  
And by Your grace oh God I stand with my head held high  
I receive Your love, I receive Your love for me  
I receive Your love, I know I am accepted, oh  
Established, ever blameless in Your Son  
Forever I am chosen to be loved  
It's not by my works, by Your work in me, yeah  
And by Your grace oh God I stand with my head held high  
I receive Your love, I receive Your love for me  
I receive Your love, I know I am accepted  
I receive Your love, I receive Your love for me  
I receive Your love, I know I am accepted  
Behold all things have been made new  
My past has gone, my shame renewed  
You gave Your Son Your love for me  
Now at the cross I am made free  
I receive Your love, I receive Your love for me  
I receive Your love, I know I am accepted  
I receive Your love, I receive Your love for me  
I receive Your love, I know I am accepted  
I receive Your love  
Where would I be?  
Where would I be if not for Your grace?
