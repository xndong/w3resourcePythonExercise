I met her at the 7-11  
Now I'm in seventh heaven  
Tell me, tell me  
Can this be true  
I never thought I'd ever  
Meet a girl like you  
  
She was standing by the Space Invaders  
So I said can I see you later  
Yeah we went for a little spin  
Down to the Holiday Inn  
  
We was young and in love  
We was young and in love  
And you're the only girl  
I'm ever thinking of  
  
We went down to the record swap  
The kids were dancing  
To the blitzkrieg bop  
Bop-shoo-wop shoo-wop shoo-wop  
Bop-shoo-wop shoo-wop shoo-wop  
  
What ever happened to the radio  
And where did all the fun songs go  
Summer fun, with the Beach Boys on  
But we all know what went wrong  
Oh-wo-wo  
  
We was young and in love  
We was young and in love  
And you're the only girl  
I'm ever dreaming of  
  
And so we went down to the dance  
Which turned into a whole romance  
And after just one night  
I never knew that things could be so right  
Oh-no-no-no-no-no-no-no  
  
I kissed her and hugged her  
And I said good-bye  
Last thing I knew  
She wouldn't make it alive  
Oncoming car went out of control  
It crushed my baby  
And it crushed my soul  
Now all I've got is sorrow and pain  
Standing out here in the rain  
The crash, shattering glass  
The sirens, and pain  
Is driving me insane oh-yeah  
  
We was young and in love  
We was young and in love  
And you're the only girl  
I'm ever thinking of  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yea

When I saw you at the Cat Club  
You looked really kind of cool now  
Well come along with me 'cause  
We got a lot of things to do now  
  
You don't ever have to be lonely  
Just as long as you're here by my side  
You don't ever have to be lonely  
Just as long as you've nothing to hide  
  
Oohh...Oohh...  
Come along with me 'cause

Well come along with me 'cause

Just as long as you've nothing to hide  
  
Oohh...Oohh...  
Come along with me 'cause

Feedback blasting out my ears  
Makes me so high  
I love all the monitor men  
But why are they alive  
The van is making me crazy  
It's just like being in the navy  
  
Doomsday, doomsday's coming - 1981  
But until things blow  
I'm gonna have some fun  
The bubble's going to explode  
Probably never live to get old  
  
[Chorus:]  
But I just want to have some fun  
Probably won't see no money  
I just want to have some fun  
Before they throw me in the sanitarium  
  
Feedback blasting out my ears  
Makes me so high  
I love all the monitor men  
But why are they alive  
Well Monte's making me crazy  
It's just like being in the navy  
  
[Chorus]

Gonna kill and destroy  
I'm not an animal boy  
Why don't they understand  
I'm not an ape man  
  
Don't have brain damage  
I'm not an a wild savage  
Don't push me around  
Don't bring my head down  
  
I'm not an imbecile  
Don't treat me like an animal  
I'm not a creature in the zoo  
Don't tell me what to do  
  
You don't know what it's like  
You don't know how I feel  
I don't have a monkey's brain  
I'm not an animal  
  
You can't lock me in a cage  
This ain't the Stone Age  
Better get out of my way  
Someone's gonna have to pay  
  
Animal boy  
Animal boy  
Animal boy  
Animal boy

Any way you want it, you can call me any day  
Hey - hey - hey  
Any way you want it, you can always hear me say  
Hey - hey - hey  
It's all right (It's all right) It's all right (It's all right)  
It's all right (It's all right)  
It's all right so anyway you want it That's the way it will be  
You don't want money, you don't want a diamond ring  
Hey - hey -hey  
You say you want my lovin' more than any other thing  
Hey - hey - hey  
Anyway, anyway you want it That's all right by me  
Anyway, anyway you want it That's the way it will be  

He's go so many problems  
You can count them one by one  
He's a filthy, stupid apeman  
He never has any fun  
He lives in the jungle in a cave by a hill  
Plays an old loud drum  
He's primitive, barely human  
  
Apeman hop, apeman hop  
Paint the face of a demon, glowing by the fire light  
Hoppin' like an elephant  
Thunderin' like me tonight  
He's the world's worst recycler  
The iceman comes a lot  
He's the devil's apprentice  
He's a prehistoric man  
  
Apeman hop, apeman hop  
At night he's gonna sacrifice his beloved apeman girl  
Tie her to the alter, pull out her heart and eat her flesh  
  
Apeman hop, apeman hop, apeman hop, apeman hop  
Apeman

Have I ever told you  
How good it feels to hold you  
It isn't easy to explain  
  
And though I'm really tryin'  
I think I may start cryin'  
My heart can't wait an other day  
  
When you kiss me I just gotta  
Kiss me I just gotta  
Kiss me I just gotta say :  
  
Baby, I love you  
Come on baby  
Baby, I love you  
Baby I love, I love only you  
  
I can't live without you

I can't help it if I feel this way  
  
Oh I'm so glad I found you  
I want my arms around you  
I love to hear you call my name  
  
Oh tell me that you feel  
Tell me that you feel  
Tell me that you feel the same  
  
Baby, I love you  
Come on baby

I used to be an A student  
I never used to complain  
I used to be a truant  
But I'm still the same  
  
Bad bad brain  
Bad bad brain  
  
I used to go to parties  
I used to drink champagne  
Now I'm beginning to feel the strain  
  
Bad bad brain  
Bad bad brain

I used to have fortune and fame  
I used to have pleasure and pain  
I used to have a name  
  
Bad bad brain

Now I'm on the Bowery  
I can't remember my name  
  
Bad bad brain

(AT THE BEGINNING)

Intoxicated by the orchids abandoned in the garden  
Demanding morphine curse my soul is burning  
Stranded in the sweet wonderings  
breathing the pale moon silver  
Torn painted lips tasting the last drops of life  
  
Sometimes I feel like screaming  
Sometimes I feel I just can't win  
Sometimes I feelin' my soul is as restless as the wind  
Maybe I was born to die in Berlin  
  
I sprinkled cocaine on the floor  
when no one was watching  
I closed my eyes and I let myself sleep  
Creeps and dirty bastards,  
demons waitin' by my bed  
There's no choice or difference,  
no one seems to notice  
  
Sometimes I feel like screamin'  
Sometimes I feel I just can't win  
Sometimes I feelin' my soul is as restless as the wind  
Maybe I was born to die in Berlin  
  
Sometimes I feel like screamin  
Sometimes I feel I just can't win  
Sometimes I feelin' my soul is as restless as the wind  
Maybe I was born to die in Berlin  
Maybe I was born to die in Berlin

Got into a cab, Broadway, Fifty Ninth  
Took off like a blast  
Almost lost my mind - oh, oh, oh  
  
Cabbies on crack  
  
It first felt like at thrill ride  
Excited for a while  
Got pretty scary  
Swerving at a hundred miles an hour - oh, oh, oh  
  
Cabbies on crack  
I want to get out,  
out of this yellow shell  
I want to get out,  
crack cabbies straight from hell  
  
And I don't wanna die before I live  
Cabbies on Cabbies on crack  
  
Cabbies on crack  
Want my money back  
Disco blasting out,  
Stomach in my mouth - oh, oh, oh  
  
Cabbies on crack  
  
Times Square was approaching  
He braked for the light  
At 90 miles an hour,  
flashed by, I saw my life - oh, oh, oh  
  
Cabbies on crack  
I want to get out,  
out of this yellow shell  
I want to get out,  
crack cabbies straight from hell  
  
And I don't wanna die before I live  
Cabbies on Cabbies on crack  
  
And I don't wanna die before I live  
Cabbies on Cabbies on crack  
  
Cabbies on crack

Well I'm going out west where I belong  
Where the days are short and the nights are long  
  
And I'll walk a little walk I'll twist a little twist  
I'll shimmy a little shimmy I'll fly a little fly  
Yea we're out there having fun in the warm California sun  
  
Well, I'm going out west out on the coast  
Where the California girls are really the most  
  
Where they walk and I'll walk They fish and I'll fish  
They sin and I'll sin They fly and I'll fly  
Where they're out there having fun in the warm California sun  
  
Well, the girls are frisky in old 'Frisco  
A pretty little chick wherever you go  
  
And they walk and I'll walk They fish and I'll fish  
They sin and I'll sin They fly and I'll fly  
Where they're out there having fun in the warm California sun  
  
We're out there having fun, yeah, in the warm California sun

Standing here in front of the mirror  
Its gonna be all right tonight  
Feelin' hot yeah I'm on fire  
I'm never ever goin' to tire  
  
Tonight it's gonna be alright  
Chasing the night  
Its gonna be alright  
Chasing the night  
Its gonna be alright  
Chasing the night  
  
Live my life as I choose  
I paid the price, paid my dues  
You know I need no alibi  
Daytime troubles fading  
Nights intoxicating  
Gonna have it all tonight  
That ain't no lie  
  
[Chorus]  
Rock all night  
Sleep all day  
It don't matter what they say  
Ain't never gonna change my ways  
And I won't be back till Monday  
  
Feelin' exasperating  
Excitement generating  
I'm never ever gonna tire  
City is overloading  
The circuits are exploding  
Ain't comin' down, no I'm too wired  
  
[Chorus]

Somebody calls me on the phone.  
Say hey-hey is Dee-Dee home.  
You want to take a walk.  
You want to go cop.  
You want to go get some Chinese Rock.  
  
I'm livin' on a Chinese Rock.  
All my best things are in hock.  
I'm livin' on a Chinese rock.  
Everything is in the pawn shop.  
  
The plaster fallin' of the wall.  
My girlfriend cryin' in the shower  
Stall.  
It's hot as a bitch.  
I should've been rich.  
But I'm just diggin' a Chinese ditch.

I lied, I lied

Oh oh no nothing to worry about  
Oh oh no nothing to worry about  
I lied, I lied  
Come back, come back, come back she cried  
I walked out, I walked out, I walked out  
Down the drain  
Of something else, I was in it  
So silly, so unfair, she stayed standing there  
Oh oh no nothing to worry about  
Oh oh no nothing to worry about  
I lied, I lied  
Come back, come back  
Come back, she cried  
I lied, I lied

Oh oh no nothing to worry about

I lied, I lied  
Come back, come back  
Come back, she cried  
I freaked out, I freaked out, I freaked out  
Is the water as high as it'll get  
Super wet, mom told me,  
Every chance I have seen  
Trying to get clean  
Oh oh no nothing to worry about  
Oh oh no nothing to worry about  
I lied, I lied  
Come back, come back  
Come back, she cried  
I lied, I lied

New York city is a real cool town  
Society really brings me down  
Our playground is a pharmacy  
Kids find trouble so easily  
  
Other countries are just as bad  
The soviets really make me mad  
On the boulevard where police hide  
Let's steal a car for a joyride  
  
They say you're just an awkward kid  
You flipped your lid you flipped your lid  
You love wine like they love cash  
Feel your rage spread like a rash  
  
You flipped your lid you flipped your lid  
You flipped your lid you flipped your lid  
They say you're just an awkward kid  
You flipped your lid you flipped your lid  
  
All alone in the danger zone  
Danger zone danger zone  
All alone in the danger zone  
Danger zone danger zone

Hangin' out in a hundred  
Be watching 'Get Smart' on TV.  
Thinkin' about.  
You and me and you and me.  
  
Hangin' out in L.A.  
And there's nowhere to go.  
It ain't Christmas if there ain't no snow.  
Listening to Sheena on the radio.  
Oh-ho oh-ho.

She came from a happy home  
A very happy home a very happy home  
  
Miss personality, a grade 'a' student naturally  
She had it all worked out but things aren't what  
They seem is this real or just a dream?  
And things will never ever be the same again  
  
She came from a happy home  
A very happy home a home of happiness  
  
Miss personality, a grade 'a' student naturally  
She had it all in place but things aren't what  
They seem is this real or just a dream?  
Things will never ever be the same again  
  
The dangers, it's the dangers of love  
The dangers, it's the dangers  
  
She came from a happy home  
A vey happy home a vert happy scene

Do you remember Murray the Kid

It's the end, the end of the seventies  
It's the end, the end of the century  
  
Do you remember lying in bed  
With the covers pulled up over your head  
Radio playin' so no one can see?  
We need change, and we need it fast  
Before rock's just part of the past  
'Cause, lately, it all sounds the same to me  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Will you remember Jerry Lee  
John Lennon, T. Rex and old Moulty?  
It's the end, the end of the seventies

I'm sick and tired of you calling me names  
I'm sick and tired of your childish games  
I'm sick and tired of your bullshit brats  
Cocaine stupor and anxiety attacks  
  
Picked up the magazine, I see your face  
You're nothin' boy, a goddamn waste  
With the lamest fashions on your back  
You're never happy, a hypochondriac  
  
Don't bust my chops, baby, don't bust my chops  
Yeah!  
  
You're a styling queen and an alley cat  
Too many chocolates keep a fat man fat  
You're a pain in the ass, and your on the (loose)  
All I get from you is your bad attitude  
  
Dirty mouth, it's all I can bear  
Get outta here bitch, 'cause you're nowhere  
Always wearin' that cheap perfume  
Can always tell when you're in the room  
  
Don't bust my chops, baby, don't bust my chops  
Ah  
  
Don't bust my chops, baby, don't bust my chops  
Alright

You know it's generally known  
You got everything at home  
Kisses out of desperation  
Bring you more aggravation  
And you don't come close  
You don't come close  
You don't come close  
You bring out your souvenirs  
Soak them wet with your tears  
You lose your imagination  
Out of more aggravation  
And you don't come close  
You don't come close  
You don't come close  
You turn red with rage  
But act your age  
Only thing that you regret  
You need more time to forget  
And you don't come close  
You don't come close  
You don't come close

Verse:  
Don't pour out all the oil  
It isn't very good for the soil  
Don't waste the only fuel that we have  
  
Chorus:  
The lawnmower needs some gasoline  
And I need some for my camero  
Don't pour it down the driveway  
Not today or tomorrow  
I really wanna take a bath  
In the brown, think sludge  
It looks pretty tasty  
It smells a lot like fudge  
  
Verse:  
My pants are all brown  
Do you see my scary frown  
That means I probably want to pound on you  
  
Chorus:  
The lawnmower needs some gasoline  
And I need some for my camero  
Don't pour it down the driveway  
Not today or tomorrow  
I really wanna take a bath  
In the brown, think sludge  
It looks pretty tasty  
It smells a lot like fudge

One-two-three-four  
  
You don't want to share with anyone else  
You got all the money, you got all the wealth  
You got all the buildings and the factories  
You got all the power and the ceremonies  
  
You wanna play a game of cat and mouse  
With the President in the White House  
This is a hungry world, there are months to feed  
There are millionaires with more than they need  
  
Eat that rat Eat that rat  
Eat that rat Eat that rat  
  
One-two-three-four  
  
Don't believe what you've been told  
You can't change a turd into gold  
Somehow we get all these creeps in control  
It makes me throw up in the toilet bowl  
  
You thieving whore, you hustle for bucks  
You take the money and you shoot it up  
That's the breaks, it's the chance you take  
Get it together for your children's sake  
  
Eat that rat Eat that rat  
Eat that rat Eat that rat

I kill myself kill the pain  
A suicide death a suicide game  
My skull he's bleaching in the dust  
My rage turns to insane lust  
  
All depressed all alone  
I drift into the danger zone  
Deadly spittin cobra life of crime  
I want revenge I want what's mine  
  
Like takin' Carrie to the high school prom  
Something's always goin' wrong  
Hair trigger temper tormented mind  
Deadly spittin cobra I am losin' kind  
  
The heart is the place devils congregate  
When you're raised on a diet of bickering at hate  
Hair trigger temper tormented mind  
Deadly spittin cobra I am losin' kind  
  
Endless vacation  
Endless vacation

She was a really good friend  
A really good friend to me, yeah  
She was a really good friend  
A really good friend to me, yeah  
  
But they took her away  
Tossed her in the bin  
Now she's hanging out  
In East Berlin, ow-ooo  
  
She had a very bad affair  
With some cat from Hiroshima  
She turned into a head of lettuce  
She eats Thorazine in her farina  
But they took her away  
Tossed her in the bin  
Now she's hanging out  
In East Berlin, ow-ooo  
  
And everytime I eat vegetables  
It makes me think of you  
And everytime I eat vegetables  
I don't know what to do, to do ow-ooo

I need psychiatric therapy  
I could use a lobotomy  
Guess I'll never learn  
Suppose I'll always be a worm  
  
Freak of nature  
Got a ten inch erection, a pimply complexion  
Man I got problems, I'll bet you heard  
I'm completely misunderstood  
  
Fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa  
Fa fa  
  
I'm a monstrosity  
I'm a human oddity  
Everybody's staring at me  
I'm an outcast from society  
Freak of nature  
  
Fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa

Gabba Gabba Hey.......... (until it fades)

When I woke up this morning from the night before  
My brain was pulsating, I was battered and sore  
Nothing I tried would satisfy  
Cold Coke and Pepsi or Canada Dry  
  
What's so wrong, hair of the dog  
There's nothing wrong, hair of the dog  
  
What's so wrong, hair of the dog  
There's nothing wrong, hair of the dog  
  
Finally pulled myself out of my bed  
Feeling kinda dodgy, I was feeling half dead  
Done it before, probably do it again  
Don't know if I ever will learn  
  
What's so wrong, hair of the dog  
There's nothing wrong, hair of the dog  
What's so wrong, hair of the dog  
There's nothing wrong, hair of the dog  
Hair of the dog  
Hair of the dog  
  
Finally pulled myself out of my bed  
Feeling kinda dodgy, I was feeling half dead  
Done it before, probably do it again  
Don't know if I ever will learn  
  
What's so wrong, hair of the dog  
There's nothing wrong, hair of the dog  
What's so wrong, hair of the dog  
There's nothing wrong, hair of the dog  
What's so wrong, hair of the dog  
There's nothing wrong, hair of the dog  
What's so wrong, hair of the dog  
There's nothing wrong, hair of the dog

I heard it from the gangster  
I heard it from the priest  
I heard it from my best friend  
Way down in the middle east  
  
Have a nice day. That's all I hear every day  
Have a nice day. I don't believe a word you say  
  
I heard from the landlord  
When he kicked me out  
I heard it from the spirits  
As they possessed my house  
  
Have a nice day. That's all I hear every day  
Have a nice day. I don't believe a word you say  
  
When they look me in the eye I turn the other way  
It's just a trained reaction something they gotta say... yeah  
  
I heard it from New Zealand  
I heard it at the club  
I heard it from my doctor  
Before he pulled the plug  
  
Have a nice day. That's all I hear every day  
Have a nice day. I don't believe a word you say  
Have a nice day. That's all I hear every day  
Have a nice day. I don't believe a word you say

As time went on it seemed forever,  
Times have changed now things are better,  
Someone had to pay the price.  
  
And I think of times we were together,  
As time went on it seemed forever,  
Times have changed now things are better,  
Someone had to pay the price.

Sinking into the stars  
Diving in for a swim  
Soaring like a superhero  
Past the end of Disneyland  
  
Through dragon mist  
Above alpine peaks  
To the cloudy lace  
To the highest trails above  
  
I feel so safe  
I feel content  
Send you all my love  
  
Southern winds, shining rays  
Are all I need for fight  
Flying way past zero  
Paradise is just in sight  
  
Through the distant blue  
Above the highest stars  
To the silent dark  
Send you all my love  
  
I feel so safe  
Flying an a ray  
On the highest trails above  
  
Sinking into the stars  
Diving in for a swim  
Soaring like a superhero  
Past the edge of Disneyland  
  
Every wish comes true  
Most desired dreams  
Happy endings too  
Finally you find love  
  
I feel so safe  
Flying an a ray  
On the highest trails above

I can't stand still cause you've got me goin'  
Your slacks are low and your hips are showin'  
I take you girl as you're standin' there  
Your low cut slacks and your long black hair  
Don't want you goin' round with no one else  
Cause when I'm with you I can't control myself  
  
Defenses down and you got me shakin'  
You got me so that my nerves are breakin'  
If you knew me like I know you girl  
Your knees would bend and your hair would curl  
You make me move yea like no one else  
Cause when I'm with you I can't control myself  
  
I've got this feeling that's inside of me  
It makes me think of how things used to be  
It makes me feel alright  
When I'm with you at night and we love  
And we love  
  
You thrill me so with this big temptation  
This kind of feelin' could move a nation  
And I'm okay when I'm here with you  
I do the things that you want me to  
I do these things for no one else 'cause when I'm with you I can't control
myself  
  
I can't control myself  
I can't control myself  
I can't control myself  
I can't control myself

I heard about the Ester bunny  
Presents under a Christmas tree  
It was dreaming and fantasy  
There was no Mom or Daddy  
  
I wanted everything  
I wanted everything  
I wanted everything  
  
I had the world on my shoulder  
But I was getting older  
Knew I was ready for it  
Some kind of envelopment  
  
I wanted everything  
I wanted everything  
I wanted everything  
  
All day working on a truck  
Bringing the groceries up  
Not much of a salary  
No tip for the delivery  
  
I wanted everything  
I wanted everything  
I wanted everything  
  
There's no success for me  
Involved in a robbery  
There's money in the supermarket  
And I'm goin' after it  
  
I wanted everything  
I wanted everything  
I wanted everything  
  
I wanted everything  
I wanted everything

Well I'm affected  
And all I want is you  
  
Didn't know it a few years ago  
But now I finally know  
I want you by my side  
I want you baby, baby, baby, baby  
  
Yeah, I love you and I want you to know  
Yeah, yeah, and that's for sure  
I want you by my side  
Cause I'm affected, 'fected  
Yeah, I'm affected, 'fected  
Well, I'm affected  
And all I want is you

Well I'm against it  
I'm against it  
Well I'm against it  
I'm against it  
  
I don't like politics  
I don't like communists  
I don't like games and fun  
I don't like anyone  
  
Well I'm against it  
I'm against it  
Well I'm against it  
I'm against it  
  
I don't like Jesus freaks  
I don't like circus geeks  
I don't like summer and spring  
I don't like anything  
  
I don't like sex and drugs  
I don't like water bugs  
I don't care about poverty  
All I care about is me  
  
Well I'm against it  
I'm against it  
Well I'm against it  
I'm against it  
  
I don't like playing ping pong  
I don't like the Viet Cong  
I don't like Burger King  
I don't like anything  
  
And I'm against it  
I'm against it  
Well I'm against it

I am not afraid of life  
Of the poor man's struggle  
Of the killer's knife  
I am not afraid of life  
Of an insane rage  
Of the minimum wage  
I am not afraid of life  
  
I am not afraid of life  
I am not afraid of life  
  
But I see an old lady with a shopping bag  
And I wonder is life a drag  
  
I am not afraid of pain  
But it hurts so bad  
I feel so mad  
No one see the truth  
There's nothing to gain  
A life goes down the drain  
Don't want to die at an early age  
  
I am not afraid of life  
I am not afraid of life  
  
But I see a street crazy shivering with cold  
Is it a crime to be old  
  
There's the threat of the nuclear bomb  
We know it's wrong  
We know it's wrong  
Is there a chance for peace  
Will the fighting ever cease  
Mankind's almost out of luck  
A maniac could blow us up  
  
I am not afraid of life  
I am not afraid of life  
  
But I get down on my knees and I pray  
Is there hope for the world today

Don't wear a crown of thorns  
Got no holes in my hand  
Don't accuse me of that crime  
Don't hang me up to dry  
  
It's not me It's not me It's not me  
  
Don't wanna die for your sins  
Got no special powers  
Sacrifice and sacrilege  
Hey man, I wanna live  
  
I'm not Jesus  
I can't heal you  
  
Taste my blood  
it doesn't taste like wine  
Can't you see this cross isn't mine  
Judas must die for what he has done  
Satan's watching with his gun  
  
It's not me  
It's not me  
It's not me  
  
Father, son and Holy Ghost  
Say your prayers-it's your only hope  
Twelve apostles can't help you now  
I'll be back to stake my ground  
  
I'm not Jesus  
I can't heal you  
I'm not Jesus  
I can't heal you  
  
Don't wear a crown of thorns  
Got no holes in my head  
Don't accuse me of that crime  
Don't hang me up to dry  
  
I'm not Jesus  
I can't heal you  
I'm not Jesus  
I can't heal you  
I'm not Jesus  
I can't heal you

All dressed up an' the sun sets low  
When the big bright moon  
Shines a friendly hello  
When my heart pants  
With lust like a Romeo  
Like I am messed up  
When the fireflies glow  
  
I just want to cuss and fight  
I goin' out tonight  
Everything is out of sight  
It's gonna be all right  
  
I am gonna hang out in the park  
Hang out after dark  
I am gonna be with the gang tonight  
  
Under street lamps I will play  
After the school day  
When troubles disappear  
I feel excitement is here  
  
Kids in cars were cruisin' by  
The big bright moon  
Smiles in the sky  
Music playin' that portable sound  
Everybody's hangin' all around  
  
I am gonna hang out in the park  
Hang out after dark  
I am gonna be with the gang tonight  
I am gonna be with the gang tonight  
I am gonna be with the gang tonight

My mom and dad are always fighting  
And it's getting very unexciting  
To get a good job  
You need a proper schooling  
Now who the hell  
Do ya think you're fooling  
  
But it's not my place oh no  
No it's not my place no no  
No it's not my not my not my place  
In the 9 to 5 world  
And it's not my place  
In the 9 to 5 world  
  
And it's not my place  
With 9 to 5 girl  
It's not my place  
In the 9 to 5 world  
  
Hangin' out with Lester Bangs you all  
And Phil Spector really has it all  
Uncle Floyd shows on the T. V.  
Jack Nicholson, Clint Eastwood, 10cc  
  
But it's not my place  
  
Don't wanna be a working stiff  
Lose my identity  
'Cause when it comes  
To working 9 to 5  
There ain't not place for me  
Ain't my reality to me  
  
Vin Scelsa's on the radio  
Ramones are hangin' out in Kokomo  
Roger Corman's on a talk show  
With Allan Arkush and Stephen King  
You know  
But it's not my place

Leave your cares behind  
Come with us and find  
The pleasures of a journey to the center of the mind  
Come along if you care  
Come along if you dare  
Take a ride to the land inside of your mind  
Beyond the seas of thought  
Beyone the realm of what  
Across the streams of hopes and dreams where things are really not  
Come along if you care  
Come along if you dare  
Take a ride to the land inside of your mind  
But please realise  
You'll probably be surprised  
For it's the land unknown to man  
Where fantasy is fact  
So if you can, please understand  
You might not come back  
Come along if you care  
Come along if you dare  
Take a ride to the land inside and you'll see  
How happy life could be  
If all of mankind  
Would take the time to journey to the center of the mind  
Would take the time to journey to the center of the mind  
Center of the mind

Mercenary, fight for anyone  
Fight for money  
Fight for fun  
  
Let's go  
Let's go

Hire my SMG with a full clip  
On automatic it's guaranteed hit  
  
Let's go  
Let's go  
Let's go  
Let's go

Let's go  
Let's go

Verse 1:  
Lisa got a haircut  
Another one today  
She stuck a pair of scissors up her butt  
And now she cries all day  
  
Chorus:  
From a mohawk to a mullet  
From shaved head to a bullet  
She chops off her hair  
But I don't really care  
She had hair down to her underwear  
She even grew a beard  
But most guys weren't impressed with that  
They all thought that was weird  
  
Verse 2:  
She started changing colour  
A new one everyday  
Last week she had it purple  
All the kids thought that was lame  
  
Chorus:  
From a mohawk to a mullet  
From shaved head to a bullet  
She chops off her hair  
But I don't really care  
She had hair down to her underwear  
She even grew a beard  
But most guys weren't impressed with that  
They all thought that was weird  
  
Verse 3:  
Lisa is a maniak  
She cut off all her hair  
She even had her tounge pierced  
And tatooed ugly stare  
  
Chorus:  
From a mohawk to a mullet  
From shaved head to a bullet  
She chops off her hair  
But I don't really care  
She had hair down to her underwear  
She even grew a beard  
But most guys weren't impressed with that  
They all thought that was weird  
  
Bridge:  
But the boys in the back don't think she's very pretty  
And the guys in the front will always call her witty  
But when you've got a hair cut that really looks that shitty  
Its no doubt they'd probably spit on both your mittys  
  
Chorus:  
From a mohawk to a mullet  
From shaved head to a bullet  
She chops off her hair  
But I don't really care  
She had hair down to her underwear  
She even grew a beard  
But most guys weren't impressed with that  
They all thought that was weird  
  
They all thought that was weird (x3)

Next time I'll listen to my heart  
Next time, well I'll be smart  
Next time I'll listen to my heart  
Next time, well I'll be smart  
Next time I'll listen to my heart  
Next time, well I'll be smart  
Next time I'll listen to my heart  
Next time, well I'll be smart  
That girl could still be mine  
But I'm tired of the hurt  
Tired of tryin'  
I'm tired of the pain  
Tired of tryin'  
I'm tired of cryin'

Now when you're feelin' low  
And the fish won't bite  
You need a little bit o' soul  
To put you right  
You gotta make like you  
Want to kneel and pray  
And then a little bit o' soul  
Will come your way  
  
Now when your girl has gone  
And you're broke in two  
You need a little bit o' soul  
To see you through  
And when you raise the roof  
With you rock and roll  
You'll get a lot more kicks  
With a little bit o' soul  
  
And if your party falls  
Cause there's nobody groovin'  
A little bit o' soul and  
It really starts movin', yeah!  
  
Now when you're in a mess  
And you feel like cryin'  
Just remember this little  
Song of mine  
And as you walk through life  
Tryin' to reach your goal  
Remember what I say 'bout  
A little bit o' soul  
  
And if your party falls  
Cause there's nobody groovin'  
A little bit o' soul and  
It really starts movin', yeah!  
A little bit o' soul  
A little bit o' soul  
A little bit o' soul

Lovely lovely locket love  
You could use a little of  
Hang a chain around you  
You're hangin' too  
Hang on a little bit longer  
Hang on you're a goner  
  
Lovely lovely locket love  
Cause a picture never does  
Try to expose you  
For what you put me through  
Hang on a little bit longer  
Hang on you're a goner  
  
Never never can tell  
How hard you fell  
Lovely lovely locket 'cause  
The best poison of  
  
Lovely lovely locket love  
You got a pocket of  
Lovely little tricks you do  
Now I'm hangin' too  
Hang on a little bit longer  
Hang on you're a goner

Sid was a punk rock king  
Nancy was a broken queen  
Their lives were so glamorous  
Sid and Nancy were a mess  
  
When you're hooked on heroin  
Don't you know you'll never win  
Drugs don't ever pay  
You really did it your way  
  
Love kills (x3)  
We still believe in anarchy  
It makes me so damn angry  
Sid and Nancy meant a lot to me  
You may be dead but your souls are free  
Like Romeo and Juliet  
You two made a pact of death  
Like the needle that ya used  
Sid and Nancy were born to lose  
  
Love kills (x3)  
Sid never meant any harm  
He shot some dope into his arm  
All he wanted was some fun  
Now she's lying in a pool of blood  
Always loaded, always high  
Why did you have to die?  
I'll say one thing is  
It leaves me with a bitter taste  
  
Love kills (x9)

Everybody said so man you could see it on T.V.  
They stood there ashamed with nowhere to go  
Nobody wants them now the kids are alright  
Every day is a holiday and pushin' people around  
  
I'm making monsters for my friends  
I'm making monsters for my friends  
  
Someone caught one I could see so myself  
I had to call 254 so they wouldn't blame me  
We wanted to know how much trouble there was  
When we asked our daddy he said it's just because  
  
I'm making monsters for my friends  
I'm making monsters for my friends  
  
I don't want to open a can of worms and  
I don't want any Spagetti-Os  
And I could always tell when  
Someone is holding a grudge  
  
I'm making monsters for my friends  
I'm making monsters for my friends  
I'm making monsters for my friends  
I'm making monsters for my friends

Couldn't keep a secret  
Got a concrete skull  
Couldn't shut up  
You're an imbecile  
You're an ugly dog  
There's nothing to gain  
You couldn't shut up  
Got a bad bad brain  
  
Couldn't hold your tongue  
You were just too young  
Like a two year old  
You told you told  
You are all the same jelly  
Bean brain  
Every one's a secret nerd.  
Every one's closet lame  
  
Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-mama's boy  
Don't want to work in a hot dog stand  
Be a busboy messenger or a doorman  
It's an abstract world  
You're an abstract man  
Abstract city don't give a damn

Evil in my head, in my head, inside this private hell  
I'm not feeling very well  
Frustration, disgust, aggravation, disgust, mental hell  
I'm not feeling very well  
  
Day, day after day, it never changes, always the same way  
Day after day, day after day, day after  
  
Demons in my head, in my head, inside this private hell  
I'm not feeling very well  
Frustration, disgust, aggravation, disgust, mental hell  
I'm not feeling very well  
  
Day, day after day, it never changes, always the same way  
Day after day, day after day, day after  
  
Do do do do  
Mental  
Hell mental  
Hell mental

Merry christmas, i don't want to fight tonight with...  
  
Merry christmas, i don't want to fight tonight  
Merry christmas, i don't want to fight tonight  
Merry christmas, i don't want to fight tonight with you  
  
Where is santa at his sleigh? tell me why is it always this way?  
Where is rudolph? where is blitzen, baby? merry christmas, merry merry merry
christmas  
  
All the children are tucked in their beds sugar-plum fairies dancing in their
heads  
Snowball fighting, it's so exciting baby  
  
I love you and you love me and that's the way it's got to be  
I loved you from the start 'cause christmas ain't the time for breaking each
other's heart

Crimson flames tied through my ears  
Rollin' high and mighty traps  
Pounced with fire on flaming roads  
Using ideas as my maps  
"We'll meet on edges, soon," said I  
Proud 'neath heated brow.  
Ah, but I was so much older then,  
I'm younger than that now.  
  
Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth  
"Rip down all hate," I screamed  
Lies that life is black and white  
Spoke from my skull. I dreamed  
Romantic facts of musketeers  
Foundationed deep, somehow.  
Ah, but I was so much older then,  
I'm younger than that now.  
  
In a soldier's stance, I aimed my hand  
At the mongrel dogs who teach  
Fearing not that I'd become my enemy  
In the instant that I preach  
My pathway led by confusion boats  
Mutiny from stern to bow.  
Ah, but I was so much older then,  
I'm younger than that now.  
  
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats  
Too noble to neglect  
Deceived me into thinking  
I had something to protect  
Good and bad, I define these terms  
Quite clear, no doubt, somehow.  
Ah, but I was so much older then,  
I'm younger than that now.

Verse 1:  
I bought a little dog from my local pet shop  
He prances around with a little white mop  
I don't think he's an animal I can afford  
Everyday I take him surfin on his little surfboard  
  
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah (x2)  
  
Verse 2:  
He's pickin up dogs and he's givin them licks  
He's always gettin me a lot of chicks  
I don't think he's an animal I can afford  
Everyday I take him surfin on his little surfboard  
  
Chorus:  
My dog, is well, he's doin mighty fine  
My dog, is swell, he's all mine  
My dog, is good, he's swingin through the vine  
My dog, really should, stop pretending he's a porcupine  
  
Verse 3:  
The wee little puppy never passes on a meal  
One time I ran him over on my car's rear wheel  
I don't think he's an animal I can afford  
Everyday I take him surfin on his little surfboard  
  
Chorus:  
My dog, is well, he's doin mighty fine  
My dog, is swell, he's all mine  
My dog, is good, he's swingin through the vine  
My dog, really should, stop pretending he's a porcupine  
  
Bridge:  
If he doesn't get his act together  
I'll be in really deep shit  
If I can't pay for kibble  
I'll have to morgage my house a bit  
  
Chorus:  
My dog, is well, he's doin mighty fine  
My dog, is swell, he's all mine  
My dog, is good, he's swingin through the vine  
My dog, really should, stop pretending he's a porcupine  
  
My dog, is well, he's doin mighty fine  
My dog, is swell, he's all mine  
My dog, is good, he's swingin through the vine  
My dog, really should, stop pretending he's a porcupine

When I saw you on Eighth Street  
You could make my life complete, baby  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
You're my-my kind of a girl  
  
And when I saw you by  
The jukebox, ow-ow  
You put a quarter in and played  
My favorite song too, baby  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
You're my-my kind of a girl  
  
I think we'd look pretty good together,  
Walking through a winter wonderland  
And this time I think it's forever  
I hope your parents understand  
  
When I saw you by the Peppermint Lounge  
You were lost but you've been found, baby  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
You're my-my kind of a girl

[Originally by The Knack]  
Oo my little pretty one, pretty one

Close enough to look in my eyes, Sharona  
Keep a little mystery, kissin' me  
Runnin' down the length of my thigh, Sharona

My-ee ey-ee by-ee ahee ah woo!

Never gonna stop, give it up, such a dirty mind  
I always get it up from a touch of the younger kind

I saw her today, I saw her face  
It was the face of love, and I knew  
I had to run away  
And get down on my knees and pray, that they go away  
And still it begins, needles and pins  
Because of all my pride, the tears I gotta hide  
Oh I thought I was smart, I stole her heart  
I didn't think I'd do, but now I see  
She's worth to him than me, let her go ahead  
Take his love instead, and one day she will see  
Just how to say please, and get down on her knees  
Oh that's how it begins, she'll feel those needle and pins  
Hurtin' her, hurtin' her  
Why can't stop, and tell myself I'm wrong, I'm wrong, so wrong  
Why can't I stand up, and tell myself I'm strong  
Because, saw her today, I saw her face  
It was the face of love, and I knew  
I had to run away  
And get down on my knees and pray, that they go away  
And still it begins, needles and pins  
Because of all my pride, the tears I gotta hide  
Needle and pins, needle and pins, needle and pins

Check her out  
She wants to be part of the city  
Well, I'll treat that girl just like a queen  
She looks kinda like a hopeless drug fiend  
[chorus]  
Hey new girl you just arrived in town  
Hey new girl can I show you around  
Let me show you the lights of the city  
Let me show you every avenue  
Let me show you what the rock n' roll kids do

Check her out  
She looks real cool, just like one of us  
Comes from New Jersey, just like all of us  
Every freak in town wants ???

If your, missing anything  
C'mon girl and find out  
What the rock n' roll kids are all about  
[chorus x3]  
  
  

I got a call late Saturday night alright  
Yeah I got a call late Saturday night alright  
Beat, dead, burnt out from the night before  
I wanted to go but couldn't take it no more  
  
Beat, dead, burnt out you know what I mean  
My brain was racin' but my feet wouldn't scream  
  
Let's go let's go  
Oh oh oh oh  
  
My brain was racin' but my feet wouldn't go  
Let's fly, let's fly  
Yeah you and I  
Oh my my my  
  
Oh oh oh  
My brain was racin' but my feet wouldn't fly  
Hey  
I wanted to go  
Oh no  
I wanted to go  
Oh no  
I wanted to go  
Oh no  
  
Oh no ho  
Let's fly

I'm not lookin' for a friend  
I don't have such vanity  
I walked alone into the woods  
I don't take no sympathy  
If that's the way it's gotta be  
Well there's no more loyalty  
Somebody always tryin' to complain  
I don't need no one to blame  
It's a bad, bad, bad day  
I hope our paths never cross again  
I needed just one break it never came  
I kept my cool  
I ain't the same  
I had a lot of drinks and fun  
It just made me sleepy  
There's not much that I want to say  
I never said I am sorry  
It's a bad, bad, bad day  
I hope our paths never cross again  
On weekends if it decides to rain  
I watch my friends go down the drain  
I'm not looking for a friend  
I don't have such vanity  
I walked alone into the woods  
I don't take no sympathy

Now I want to sniff some glue  
Now I want to have somethin' to do  
All the kids want to sniff some glue  
All the kids want somethin' to do  
1-2-3-4 Now I want to sniff some glue  
Now I want to have somethin' to do  
All the kids want to sniff some glue  
All the kids want somethin' to do  
One-two-three-four-five-six-seven-eight  
Now I want to sniff some glue  
Now I want to have somethin' to do  
All the kids want to sniff some glue  
All the kids want somethin' to do  
Now I want to sniff some glue  
Now I want to have somethin' to do  
All the kids want to sniff some glue  
All the kids want somethin' to do

Hanging out and shooting out all of the lights  
I toss and toss, it's after dark  
Is this real or just a dream, some fantasy?  
And is this real or emptiness?  
  
We're getting out of here  
As fast as we can  
Oh, we're getting out of here  
As fast as we can  
  
She still stand beside my parts and in this world  
It's getting sicker all the time  
Say that victim, a victim made society  
Chop her ankle and bring it back to her family, yeah  
  
We're getting out of here  
As fast as we can  
Oh, we're getting out of here  
As fast as we can  
  
Dusty highway  
Wait, await and see  
West of passion  
Oh, turn back to me  
Oh, come back to me, oh  
  
Nuclear alarmament, disarmament  
We are going straight to hell  
Kill for problem, kill for pride and kill for fun  
Democracy has just begun, yeah  
  
We're getting out of here  
As fast as we can  
Oh, we're getting out of here  
As fast as we can  
  
We'll never passes with open  
Pass through this way again  
The night is gladly or somewhat, so it seems  
Is this real or just a dream? Yeah  
  
Oh  
Oh

New York City, N.Y.C.,

Black leather, knee-hole pants,  
Can't play no high school dance,  
Fuzz tone, hear 'em go, hear 'em on the radio,

Chewing out a rhythm on my bubble gum the sun is out and I want some

I know your everything  
Well I know those tales you told  
I smell them in the breeze  
With every midnight break, I beg you take me please  
I let my soul escape  
Well I let my blood run cold  
So that my nerves would freeze  
Whatever it would take, to set my heart at ease  
Well later on it got so complicated  
That little rock became the roots of hatred,  
Roots of hatred, roots of hatred, had me fallin'  
Fallin' apart, eatin', eatin' away all of my heart.  
A secret hiding place  
You said there's very gold  
Under roots of all those trees  
Whatever it would take to set my heart at ease  
Well later on it got so complicated  
That little rock became the roots of hatred,  
Roots of hatred, roots of hatred, had me fallin'  
Fallin' apart, eatin', eatin' away all of my heart.

Smooth bore, scattergun, you are the only one  
To cover me when I sleep, cover me in my dreams  
Carry a smooth bore  
Scattergun, steal from me there'll be no time to run  
I got the bead on you, she fires true  
Take what you want and I'll do what I have to do  
Smooth bore, scattergun, scattergun, scattergun  
  
Triple-O bucks the only shot for me  
Cut any man right off at the knees  
Don't need to bother the police,  
I've got my Mossberg 590  
  
Smooth bore, scattergun, you are the only one  
To cover me when I sleep,  
Cover me in my dreams carry a smooth bore  
Scattergun, steal from me there'll be no time to run  
I got the bead on you, she fires true  
Take what you want and I'll do what I have to do  
Smooth bore, scattergun, scattergun, scattergun  
  
Smooth bore, scattergun, you are the only one  
To cover me when I sleep,  
Cover me in my dreams carry a smooth bore  
Scattergun, scattergun, scattergun

What makes you think she'll go with you  
What makes you think you're better than me  
You think you can read her mind  
Maybe you're just looking for a good time  
Maybe you can give her more  
Tell me what you're doing this for  
Stay away from her,  
Cause it's making me angry  
  
Don't tell me how to love my baby  
Don't tell me how to love my baby  
Don't tell me how to love my baby  
Don't tell me how to love my baby  
She belongs to me  
  
You come around looking for kicks  
But I know all about your dirty tricks now  
You think you took away my dream  
Ain't gonna be easy 'cause I get real mean  
Get out of here, get out of my life  
You're gonna be sorry if we have to fight  
Stay away from her,  
Cause it's making me angry  
  
Don't tell me how to love my baby  
Don't tell me how to love my baby  
Don't tell me how to love my baby  
Don't tell me how to love my baby  
She belongs to me  
  
Don't tell me how to love my baby  
Don't tell me how to love my baby  
Don't tell me how to love my baby  
Don't tell me how to love my baby  
Don't tell me how to love my baby  
Don't tell me how to love my baby  
Don't tell me how to love my baby  
Don't tell me how to love my baby  
She belongs to me

Another night out on the street  
Stopping for my usual seat  
Oh, bartender, please  
  
Tanqueray and tonic's my favorite drink  
I don't like anything colored pink  
That just stinks...it's not for me  
  
It feels like somebody put something  
Somebody put something in my drink  
Somebody put something  
Somebody put something  
  
Blurred vision and dirty thoughts  
Feel out of place, very distraught  
Feel something coming on  
  
Kick the jukebox, slam the floor  
Drink, drink, drink, drink some more  
I can't think  
Hey! What's in this drink?  
  
It feels like somebody put something  
Somebody put something in my drink  
Somebody put something  
Somebody put something in my drink  
Somebody put something  
Somebody put something in my drink  
Somebody put something...in my drink...in my drink...  
in my drink...in my drink  
  
So you think it's funny  
A college prank  
Goin' insane for something to drink  
Feel a little dry  
  
Oh, I couldn't care what you think of me  
Cause somebody put something in my drink  
I can't think  
Hey! Give me a drink  
  
It feels like somebody put something  
Somebody put something in my drink  
Somebody put something  
Somebody put something in my drink  
Somebody put something  
Somebody put something in my drink  
Somebody put something  
Somebody put something in my drink  
Somebody put something  
Somebody put something in my drink  
Somebody put something  
Somebody put something in my drink  
Somebody put something  
Somebody put something in my drink

When the truth is found to be lies  
And all the joys within you dies  
Don't you want somebody to love  
Don't you need somebody to love  
Wouldn't you love somebody to love  
You better find somebody to love  
  
When the garden flowers baby are dead yes  
And your mind is full of red  
Don't you want somebody to love  
Don't you need somebody to love  
Wouldn't you love somebody to love  
You better find somebody to love  
  
Your eyes, I say your eyes may look like his  
But in your head baby I'm afraid you don't know where it is  
Don't you want somebody to love  
Don't you need somebody to love  
Wouldn't you love somebody to love  
You better find somebody to love  
  
Tears are running ah running down your breast  
And your friends baby they treat you like a guest  
Don't you want somebody to love  
Don't you need somebody to love  
Wouldn't you love somebody to love  
You better find somebody to love

Spiderman, Spiderman, does whatever a spider can  
Spins a web any size, catches thieves just like flies  
Look out, here comes the Spiderman  
  
Is he strong? Listen bud, he's got radioactive blood  
Can he swing from a thread? Take a look overhead  
Hey, there! There goes the Spiderman  
  
In the chill of the night At the scene of a crime  
Like a streak of light he arrives just in time  
  
Spiderman, Spiderman, friendly neighborhood, Spiderman  
Wealth and fame, he ignores, action is his reward  
Look out, here comes the Spiderman  
  
Spiderman, Spiderman, friendly neighborhood, Spiderman  
Wealth and fame, he ignores, action is his reward  
To him, life's a great big bang up, whenever there's a hang up,  
You'll find the Spiderman!

Everywhere I hear the sound of marching, charging feet, boy  
'Cause summer's here and the time is right  
For fighting in the street, boy  
But what can a poor boy do  
Except to sing for a rock 'n' roll band  
'Cause in sleepy London town  
There's just no place for a street fighting man, no  
Hey, think the time is right for a palace revolution  
But where I live the game to play is compromise solution  
Well, then what can a poor boy do  
Except to sing for a rock 'n' roll band  
'Cause in sleepy London town  
There's just no place for a street fighting man, no  
Hey, said my name is called disturbance  
I'll shout and scream, I'll kill the king, I'll rail at all his servants  
Well, what can a poor boy do  
Except to sing for a rock 'n' roll band  
'Cause in sleepy London town  
There's just no place for a street fighting man, no  

You think we look pretty good together  
You think my shoes are made of leather  
  
But I'm a substitute for another guy  
I look pretty tall but my heels are high  
The simple things you see are all complicated  
I look pretty young, but I'm just back-dated, yeah  
  
Substitute your lies for fact  
I can see right through your plastic mac  
I look all white, but my dad was black  
My fine looking suit is really made out of sack  
  
I was born with a plastic spoon in my mouth  
The north side of my town faced east, and the east was facing south  
And now you dare to look me in the eye  
Those crocodile tears are what you cry  
It's a genuine problem, you won't try  
To work it out at all you just pass it by, pass it by  
  
Substitute me for him  
Substitute my coke for gin  
Substitute you for my mum  
At least I'll get my washing done

Take it easy baby  
Take it as it comes  
Don't move too fast  
If you want your love to last  
You've been moving much too fast  
  
Time to walk, time to run  
Time to aim your arrows at the sun  
  
Go real slow  
You'll like it more and more  
Take it as it comes  
Specialize in having fun  
  
Moving much too fast  
Moving much too fast

I went out today for a walk in the rain  
I was so sad and blue I could feel any pain  
I was worried about everything my head began to howl  
I am running away from myself there's  
Too many demons around here now  
  
Everybody I don't know what to say  
I wish I could take the pain away  
Everybody I don't know what to say  
I wish I could take the pain away  
  
But that can't happen and everybody knows it's true  
And if you have to know I'll never understand you  
So if you have to go then you'd better go now  
Go off somewhere safe I hope you will somehow  
  
Everybody I don't know what to say  
I wish I could take the pain away  
Everybody I don't know what to say  
I wish I could take the pain away  
  
Everybody I don't know what to say  
I wish I could take the pain away  
Everybody I don't know what to say  
I wish I could take the pain away

Out of bed at 6:15 In a rush and you can't think  
Gotta catch the bus and train

I can't take this crazy pace  
I've become a mental case  
Yeah, this is the job that ate my brain  
  
Go to work, it's such a drag  
Face the boss, he's such a nag  
In a suit and in a tie  
  
I look so late I wanna die  
  
I can't take this crazy pace  
I've become a mental case  
Yeah, this is the job that ate my brain  
  
I punch the clock at 9:05  
I know I'm late, but still alive  
Everyone just stares at me  
(I'm last in line for this party)  
  
I can't take this crazy pace  
I've become a mental case  
Yeah, this is the job that ate my brain  
  
Five o'clock rolls around

Ain't enough hours in the day  
There's go to be a better way

I've become a mental case  
Yeah, this is the job that ate my brain

The KKK took my baby away they took her away  
Away from me The KKK took my baby away  
They took her away away from me  
  
Now I don't know where my baby can be they  
Took her away from me  
They took her away from me  
I don't know where my baby can be  
They took her away from me  
They took her away from me  
  
Ring me, ring me, ring me up the President  
And find out where my baby went  
Ring me, ring me, ring me up the FBI and find  
Out if baby's alive yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
O-o-o-o-o-o O-o-o-o-o-o  
She went away for holidays She went away for holidays  
  
The KKK took my baby away The KKK took my baby away  
They took my girl they took my baby away

There's a new sun  
Risin' up angry in the sky  
And there's a new voice  
Sayin' "we're not afraid to die"  
Let the old world make believe  
It's blind and deaf and dumb  
But nothing can change the shape of things to come  
There are changes  
Lyin' ahead in every road  
And there are new thoughts  
Ready and waiting to explode  
When tomorrow is today  
The bells may toll for some  
But nothing can change the shape of things to come  
The future's comin' in, now  
Sweet and strong  
Ain't no-one gonna hold it back for long  
There are new dreams  
Crowdin' out old realities  
There's revolution  
Sweepin' in like a fresh new breeze  
Let the old world make believe  
It's blind and deaf and dumb  
(But) nothing can change the shape of things  
Nothing can change the shape of things  
Nothing can change the shape of things  
Nothing can change the shape of things  
To come

I had no advantage over you  
There was troubles and I had 'em too  
Just 'cause you're so strung out  
Don't mean it can't work out  
  
Ba-ba-banana, this ain't Havana  
Do you like bananas, ba-ba-bananas  
  
Say you're a victim of society  
You ask them for your mercy  
Just like the cats in the garbage cans  
When's their time coming, man  
  
You better offer some resistance  
You better give up on my insistence  
Things happen overnight  
You don't give up without a fight  
  
Ba-ba-banana, this ain't Havana  
Do you like bananas, ba-ba-bananas  
  
You say you're poor and uneducated  
You ain't gotta chance 'cause you're hated  
You're on your way to life's promotion  
You hinder it with emotion  
  
Ba-ba-banana, this ain't Havana  
Do you like bananas, ba-ba-bananas

I am a tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tough tough guy  
I tell no tales I do no lie  
  
I am a tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tough tough guy  
Halo round my head too tough to die  
  
Main attraction in a freak side show  
Down in the basement where the cobwebs grow  
On my last leg just gettin' by  
Halo round my read too tough to die  
  
Rainy days rain cool wine  
I'll scratch your back if you scratch mine  
Hot sweat on my face  
I feel like goin' out someplace  
  
Up late at night my chocolate sweet  
Down at the gym where the muscle boys meet  
I am very nice guy very sincere  
In real good shape I have no fear  
  
At the concert when the band comes on  
I am in the ring where I belong  
On my last leg just gettin' by  
Halo round my head too tough to die

Twenty four hours ago  
No one could help me  
I'm alone in life  
No where to go  
  
So I picked up the phone  
Called out for help  
Some one please help me  
I'm afraid and alone  
  
Weasel face  
Weasel face  
Weasel face  
  
It's way past midnight  
T.V. set is on  
It's my only friend  
One crisis after another  
  
Ain't no loser or quitter  
It's all or nothing baby  
Cause we fought so hard  
For our piece of this world  
  
Weasel face  
Weasel face  
Weasel face
