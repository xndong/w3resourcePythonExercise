Livin' way up now in a penthouse high  
Our steaks are rare and our martini's dry  
Folks below they say it ain't fair  
Hell with them, I really don't care  
Joie de vivre, mon amie  
Ain't this the life  
Having a party on a big jet plane  
I got so drunk that I could feel no pain  
Hangin' out in acapulco,  
Drinkin' rum and sniffin' co-co  
Pretty senorita look this way  
Dancing through the night  
Everything's alright  
Girlfriend and a wife  
Ain't this the life, ain't this the life  
Ain't this the life, baby, baby, baby . . .  
Tropical island in the deep blue sea  
The natives are friendly and the lobster's free  
Sipping cognac like a french king  
Plenty of room, I own the whole thing  
Joie de vivre, mon amie  
Ain't this the life  
Think I'll go out now on a shopping spree  
Breakfast in new york, dinner in parie  
Hangin' out with lynn and suzie  
Have a massage and a ja'causezi  
Climb into bed and see what's on tv  
Dancing through the night  
Everything's alright  
Girlfriend and a wife . . .  
Ain't this the life, ain't this the life  
Ain't this the life, tell me, tell me, tell me . . .  

Lie down and close your eyes  
Hey now, hey now, hey now, hey  
You may be in for a little suprise  
Hey now, hey now, hey now, hey  
(??? Over here something moving on the floor here)  
Hey now, hey now, hey now, hey  
Something wild with a mind of it's own  
Hey now, hey now, hey now, hey  
  
Scamper about like little tiny beasts  
Looking for a house  
(or maybe just a hole  
And complain to the mouse)  
Baby baby don't cry  
  
Scamper all around way up in a tree  
So far from the ground  
Where they'll never catch me  
(???) through my brain  
Baby baby don't cry  
  
They're part of the scheme  
Nature always is  
Physical it seems  
We don't have a (basement)  
Something isn't right  
Baby baby don't cry  
  
Scamper throught the night  
Our little ears alert  
(????????????)  
It wouldn't even hurt if we  
Had a little fun  
Baby baby don't cry  
Baby baby don't cry  
Baby baby don't cry  
  
Cause animals are under our skins  
Those animals deep within  
Those animals scampering about  
Cause there ain't nothing  
To try to stop them baby  
Hey now, hey now, hey now, hey  
And they say  
Hey now, hey now, hey now, hey  
Hey now, hey now, hey now, hey  
  
Wake up, they're coming alive  
We're changing so fast  
We don't want to be left behind  
Can't stop  
Baby baby don't cry  
  
I jump around the sidewalk  
(until it starts to whir)  
We don't need clothes  
Soon we'll have our own fur  
Oh what's wrong  
Baby baby don't cry  
  
Don't feel bad  
I'm going away  
I'll come back  
Looking for you some day  
Hang on baby  
Baby baby don't cry  
  
Cause animals are under my skin  
Those animals deep within  
  
Why don't they leave me alone  
They're bringing me down  
It's just a matter of time  
I'm on the line I'm on the line  
The whole things come undone  
We're all on the line  
Get back  
I'll never come back  
Those animals  
The animals  
  
Those animals are under my skin  
Those animals are under my skin  
Those animals are under my skin  
Those animals are under my skin  
And they say  
Hey now, hey now, hey now, hey

I'll tell you 'bout a caveman lived a million years ago  
When mother earth was young and dinosaurs walked to and fro  
His skull contained but half a brain but he didn't mind at all  
He's a hot shot caveman, yah do dah [?]  
Who loved to fight and brawl  
  
He walked the misty plate in time to find whatever he could find  
Then at last he saw her there, covered with hair  
A cavegirl looking right his way, half naked, half well who can say  
Such a thing he'd never seen before, Well then need I tell you more  
The caveman fell in love, love, love  
And so he wielded his club  
  
Oooh oooh what could he do?  
You can't blame a fellow for trying his luck,  
He's just a simple caveman who wanted to---  
Well when the cavegirl came around she had some things to relate  
About the methods he used to communicate  
And she said--  
  
(Female spoken)  
I never expected a caveman to exhibit much finesse,  
But a fifty pound club ain't exactly a caress  
So if you want to call me, you better learn to talk  
Until you learn some manners buddy,  
Take a walk!

Black is for the nighttime  
Preys upon the day  
Red is for the blood that flows like rivers in our veins  
Gray is for betrayal  
What you did to me  
White is for the blinding light  
That I know I'll never see, know I'll never see  
  
Found you in the gutter  
You needed tenderness  
I gave you everything I had  
I gave you all my trust  
Handed out so neatly  
Caught me in your trap  
When I needed you the most  
You stab me in the back, stab me in the back  
  
Better luck, better luck, better luck next time  
If you do it once there'll never be a second time  
Better luck, better luck, better luck next time  
Find somebody else, you're never gonna be mine  
How do you find the nerve  
To lie right to me face  
How do you find the nerve  
  
Black is for the nighttime  
Preys upon the day  
Red is for the blood that flows like rivers in our veins  
I try and find excuses  
For what you did to me  
Can't forget that burning rage  
When I wake up thinking of your face  
For the blinding swiftness of revenge  
That I know I'll never see, know I'll never see  
  
Better luck, better luck, better luck next time  
If you do it once there'll never be a second time  
Better luck, better luck, better luck next time  
Find somebody else, you're never gonna be mine  
Better luck, better luck, better luck next time (better luck, better luck)  
Better luck, better luck, better luck next time (better luck, better luck)  
How do you find the nerve  
To lie right to me face  
How did you find the nerve  
Better luck, better luck, better luck next time (better luck, better luck)  
Better luck, better luck, better luck next time (better luck, better luck)  
Better luck, better luck, better luck next time (better luck, better luck)

Now Pluto girls are neat but you know they'll  
Eat you up alive  
Although they're nice to know when it's a thousand below  
It isn't easy to survive  
And Neptune girls are great for dancing  
With a dozen arms and legs  
They really hold you tight and they can boogie all night  
But it's so hard to kiss three heads  
  
[Chorus:]  
I wish they all could be California girls  
I wish they all could be California girls  
  
Now Martian girls are really pretty  
With complexions bright and green  
But nothing can surpass an andromeda lass  
I think their pointed heads are keen  
And Saturn girls are really funny they can  
Make you laugh to death  
With methane clouds alas combined with hydrogen gas  
Why it's a chore to take a breath  
  
[Chorus:]  
I wish they all could be California girls  
I wish they all could be California girls  
  
[guitar solo]  
  
[Chorus:]  
I wish they all could be California girls  
I wish they all could be California girls (etc. Etc.)  
  
[Chours ii] - girls- girls- girls- girls -I need  
Girls -girls- girls- girls - I need... (etc. Etc.)  
  
[Chorus iii]- Calif--ornia Calif--ornia Calif-- ornia  
Calif--ornia Calif--ornia Calif-- ornia

We were both cast forth from the same pale hand  
And we both moved freely in the shadowlands  
And we both were sculpted by the same cold wind  
And we both had armor that was made of tin  
And i tried to find you, but it's useless  
And i tried to speak, but it was useless  
And i felt so bad and i didn't know why  
And it didn't get better as time went by  
I was there for you, but you turned away  
And i tried to find you, but you turned away  
And i tried to find you, but it's useless  
And i tried to speak, but was useless  
And i tried to find you, but it's useless  
And you're so close, but i can't see you  
And you're right there, but i can't see you  
And i feel so dumb and i didn't know what to do  
You were right there but i can't see you  
And i realize that it's useless  
And i want to fight, but it's useless  
And i know you're there, but it's useless  
And you're everywhere, but it's useless  
And i tried to say it, but my tongue got tied  
And i tried to say it, but i was numb inside  
And i can't see you anymore  
And my peace of mind has gone through the door  
And i realize that it's useless  
And i thought i was right, but it was useless  
And i know you're there, but it's useless  
And you're everywhere, but it's useless  
And i can't see now in front of my nose  
And i know you're there, and i know you're close  
And you're fading away - now you disappear  
And i try to focus, but i can't see clear  
And i don't know why i feel this way  
And i can't control myself anyway  
And i don't know why i feel this way  
And i can't control myself anyway  
And i feel so bad, but it's useless  
And i feel so bad, but it's useless  
And i feel so bad, but it's useless  
And i can't see... now in front of my face.

There's nothing wrong with Capitalism  
There's nothing wrong with free enterprise  
Don't try to make me feel guilty  
I'm so tired of hearing you cry  
There's nothing wrong with making some profit  
If you ask me I'll say it's just fine  
There's nothing wrong with wanting to live nice  
I'm so tired of hearing you whine  
About the revolution  
Bringin' down the rich  
When was the last time you dug a ditch, baby!  
If it ain't one thing  
Then it's the other  
Any cause that crosses your path  
Your heart bleeds for anyone's brother  
I've got to tell you you're a pain in the ass  
You criticize with plenty of vigor  
You rationalize everything that you do  
With catchy phrases and heavy quotations  
And everybody is crazy but you  
You're just a middle class, socialist brat  
From a suburban family and you never really had to work  
And you tell me that we've got to get back  
To the struggling masses (whoever they are)  
You talk, talk, talk about suffering and pain  
Your mouth is bigger than your entire brain  
What the hell do you know about suffering and pain . . .  
(Repeat first verse)  
(Repeat chorus)  
There's nothing wrong with Capitalism  
There's nothing wrong with Capitalism  
There's nothing wrong with Capitalism  
There's nothing wrong with Capitalism  
  

When I was young, my mind would always wander away  
I couldn't talk, never had nothin to say  
But now I'm grown, nothing much seems to have changed  
I think I'm going insane yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Is this a fairy tale, are you the seven dwarves  
Did Snow White really die while fighting in the war?  
They were the only friends I ever trusted  
Now they're scattered, and livin' in the city  
Unlisted numbers, Huh  
Cinderella undercover  
I say, better alive than dead  
The war is coming, but there's nothing much that we can do  
Stuck in a pay-phone, but the operator won't let me through  
I close my eyes, but the memories burn in my brain  
I think I'm going insane yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
I heard a rumor, they said it's gone nuclear  
I stockpile cigarettes, and double bold the door  
A sanctuary for all my friends  
We'll stay in bed until the world ends  
So please don't wake me, I gotta get some sleep  
Cinderella Undercover  
I say, better alive than dead  
I think I'm going insane, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Is this a fairy tale, this can't be real  
There's fighting all around, they're shooting in the fields  
They say that values change when hunger or ambition strikes  
Survival is essential, at any cost or any price  
The cartoon animals on Old McDonald's farm  
Are nodding off in hotel rooms with needles in their arms  
The seven dwarves, HA!, there's only four alive today  
Cinderella's working for the CIA  
Cinderella, the fairy tale's over  
You should know, you got the scars to prove it  
And your skin isn't as soft as it used to  
But I don't care, come on you said it baby  
Cinderella undercover  
I say, better alive than  
Cinderella undercover  
I say, better alive than dead  

I'm the one who preys upon the weakest  
And the weakest always preys upon the one who's underneath  
I'm the one who doesn't see the waves of human kindness or the tides that  
Turn the day  
I'm the one who always turns and looks away  
Turns and looks away  
[chorus 1]  
Because after all, we are only boys  
Because after all, we are only boys  
Will be boys will be boys will be boys  
Will be boys will be boys will be boys will be boys  
Will be boys will be boys will be boys  
Will be boys will be boys will be boys  
Will be boys will be boys will be boys  
I'm the one treads upon the weaker ones  
Those that I can find  
And there'll always be some others who could march along in line, yeah  
March along in line  
And, we'll move upon the world in a massive tidal wave  
And we'll shout and make some noise, yeah  
Shout and make some noise  
[chorus 1]  
[chorus 2]  
The clowns of death are marching on their hideous parade  
Their glaring eyes are filled with hate, but I am not afraid  
Their painted faces cracked with age, their makeup old and worn  
With tattered wings and toothy grins to amplify their scorn  
They're looking for the helpless ones  
They're looking for the misbegotten  
They prey upon the weak and fractured  
The crippled and the freaks of nature  
And when the come upon one who's lost or is alone  
Their smiles get even bigger and their noses start to glow  
Making snarling sounds to pantomime with furious abandon  
And with a scream they pounce to kill and all the while they're laughing  
I'm the one treads upon the weaker ones  
Those that I can find  
And there'll always be some others who will march along in line  
And, we'll move upon the world in a massive tidal wave  
And we'll shout and make some noise, yeah  
Shout and make some noise  
[chorus 1]  
[chorus 2]  
Your sons and daughters, innocent, lay sleeping in their beds  
They'll catch them when you're not around and smash their little heads  
If you think it just a dream, or that it isn't fair  
Just look around outside your door, the clowns are everywhere  
  

This next song is  
Is dedicated to those American fighting girls!  
  
That's right  
Those American fighting girls  
Who aren't afraid to take the law into their own hands.  
To die if necessary!  
To keep our cities safe from criminal scum.  
  
The oingo boingo proudly salutes the American commando girls  
  
Commando girls  
Commando girls  
Commando girls won't you come out tonight?  
Commando girls won't you come out and fight?  
Commando girls You'll never never catch them crying!  
  
By daytime they're receptionists  
Accountant girls so clean  
Late at night they hit the streets  
Soldiers with a dream.  
  
When they go out they arm themselves  
With kakis and fatigues  
They're tough as nails and armed to the teeth  
With automatic M-16s  
  
Iconoclastic girls that know the plan  
To finnish the job like no one else can  
To fight so the city's safe for you and me  
  
Oh!  
Commando girls won't you come out tonight?  
Commando girls won't you come out and fight?  
Commando girls you'll never never catch them crying!  
  
They prowl the streets in disciplined packs  
Looking for acts of violence  
Sweet little poison pussycats  
They travel smooth and silent  
  
And when they spot their guilty prey  
They waste no time on busts  
They stand their ground and open fire  
Unload their might of justice  
  
Oh!  
Take no prisoners and leave no clues  
Read all about it in the morning news  
Nobody out there knows what really happened!  
  
Oh!  
Command girls won't you come out tonight?  
Commando girls won't you come out and fight?  
Commando girls you'll never never catch them crying!  
  
[guitar solo]  
  
When my little girl comes home at night  
Exhausted from her fighting  
When she unzips her camouflage tights  
She always looks so inviting!  
  
Slippery skin all covered with sweat  
Shivering in the moonlight.  
Smell the gunpowder and sweet hot breath  
We're gonna have fun tonight!  
  
Oh!  
Under the covers it's hard to know  
She risked her life just minutes ago  
A stiff salute to their courage and their passion!  
  
Commando girls...  
  
[repeat this verse 3x]  
Giddy up Giddy up Get 'em all right  
Round em up round em up round em up tight  
Ready now ready now ready for the fight  
Shoot em up shoot em up shoot em in the night  
  
Commando girls won't you come out tonight?  
Commando girls won't you come out and fight?  
Commando girls you'll never never catch them crying!  
  
Never catch them crying!  
Never catch them crying!  
Commando girls...  
Commando girls...  
Commando girls...  
Commando girls...  
Commando girls...

There's someone knockin' on my door  
There's someone knockin' on my door  
I think they're looking for me  
I think they're looking for me  
Pretend there ain't nobody home  
Don't make a sound, don't even move  
Don't give them nothing to see  
I think they're looking for me  
I got to run  
I got to run  
I got to run  
I got to run  
I got to run  
There's someone crawling in my yard  
There's someone creeping on my roof  
There's someone tapping my phone  
I feel it deep in my bones  
They want to probe my intuition  
They want to find out what I know  
Why don't they leave me alone  
Why don't they leave me alone  
I got to run  
I got to run  
I got to run  
Might be the catcher  
Or the controller  
Can't be too careful  
I take precautions  
They're very clever  
I got to run  
Faceless surgeons armed with razors  
Cut out our imagination  
(Repeat first verse)  
(repeat chorus)  
Faceless surgeons armed with razors  
Cut out our imagination  
It's a strange thing  
Deadly reason  
Razors cut with such precision  
Probing deep without detection  
Razors never lie  
But it's all right  
I think they're looking for me  
I think they're looking for me  
I think they're looking for me  
I think they're looking for meeeeeeeeeee  
  

I'm all dressed up with nowhere to go  
Walkin' with a dead man over my shoulder  
  
Waiting for an invitation to arrive  
Goin' to a party where no one's still alive  
  
CHORUS  
I was struck by lighting  
Walkin' down the street  
I was hit by something last night in my sleep  
It's a dead man's party  
Who could ask for more  
Everybody's comin', leave your body at the door  
Leave your body and soul at the door . . .  
(Don't run away it's only me)  
  
All dressed up with nowhere to go  
Walkin' with a dead man  
Waitin' for an invitation to arrive  
With a dead man . . . Dead Man . . .  
  
Got my best suit and my tie  
Shiny silver dollar on either eye  
I hear the chauffeur comin' to the door  
Says there's room for maybe just one more . . .  
  
CHORUS  
  
Don't run away it's only me  
Don't be afraid of what you can't see  
Don't run away it's only me . . .

There in the shadows, looks like a hand  
Without its owner, to give it a command  
It's got a purpose but I don't know what it is  
I'm in trouble  
  
There in the streets, looks like a man  
But something wrong that I don't understand  
His eyes are open but he don't see a thing  
His skin is peeling off, his bones are sticking out  
I'm getting scared  
  
Oh my god (Is it dead?)  
Is it living? (Is it dead?)  
Is it dead or alive?  
(Is it dead?), Is it dead? (Is it dead?)  
Is it dead? (Is it dead?)  
Is it dead or alive?  
  
Hiding in the cupboards, like little mice  
Hiding in the frigerator, that isn't nice  
It's not an animal, it don't have legs  
No one else can see it  
  
It moves so fast, corner of my eye  
Look again it's gone, it's hiding  
Won't somebody help me, doesn't anybody care?  
It waits so patiently, for me to lose my guard  
I'm getting scared  
  
Is it dead, is it  
(Is it dead)  
Is it dead  
(Is it dead)  
Is it dead or alive  
(Is it dead)  
Is it dead  
(Is it dead)  
Is it dead, is it  
  
I remember there was a time  
When dead and buried meant just that  
Underneath the cold dark ground  
Things stay put!  
  
Oh them bones they make them bodies walk  
Them bones, them bones  
If they could only talk!  
  
Is it dead

Oh..  
You can tell a dirty story  
In the old conservatory...  
  
But don't go in the basement!  
  
You can make a scene  
On the mezanene  
  
But don't go in the basement!  
  
You can fill yourself with static  
With the ghosts up in the attic  
  
But don't go in the basement!  
  
You can light yourself a torch  
On the old front porch  
  
But don't go in the basement!  
  
Oh you may think that it's real cool  
To ride down the bannister like some darn fool  
Oh don't go... Don't go!!  
Don't go in the basement!  
  
You can feel quite aloof  
Playing rummy on the roof  
  
But don't go in the basement!  
  
Where the cockroaches dance  
You can wallow in romance  
  
But don't go in the basement!  
  
You may think that it's deluxe  
To ride the elevator filled with ducks  
  
Oh don't go, don't go!  
Don't go in the basement!!!!

Come to the rescue now  
Come to the rescue and stay for a little while  
Come to the burning house  
All of the ladybug's children are screaming fire  
Come to the rescue now  
CHORUS  
Tomorrow may change--tomorrow may change  
Or it may never come  
Tomorrow may change--tomorrow may change  
But it may never come  
Turn around--turn around--turn around--what do you see  
Come to the rescue now  
Come to the rescue before all our worlds collide  
Life is a dream somehow  
LIfe is speck of dust lodged in God's eye  
Life is a dream somehow  
Come to the rescue now  
Come with a mission and come with a broken heart  
Life is a dream somehow  
Life is a dream and our lives are a world apart  
Come to the rescue now  
CHORUS  
Come to the rescue  
Life is a dream somehow  
Life is a nightmare and life is a bitter pill  
(Life is a dream somehow)  
Life is a Disneyland ride which is better still  
Come to the rescue now  
Life is a drowning pool  
Life is a circus for fools just like you and me  
Life is a mortal coil  
Wrapped in cheap tin foil on a kitchen sink  
Come to the rescue now  
CHORUS  
Dreams somehow, come to the rescue now . . .  
  

Who's goin down  
Who's goin down - who's goin down  
I ride my elevator  
Through the shafts of your heart  
When you climb aboard baby  
There's no getting off  
  
I'm a silent operator won't you please take my hand  
I am so polite - I'm the elevator man  
  
Friction and harmony - who's gonna ride with me  
I'm the elevator man  
  
Who's going down who's comin with me  
Who wants to take a chance  
On a piece of abstract reality  
It's only just a dance  
Won't you come and ride with the elevator man  
Who's goin down yeah - movin slow without a sound  
  
Who's going down - who's going down - who's going down

I'm gonna bet you that heartaches  
And true love and feeble excuses  
For repressed desire adds fuel to the fire  
And the human condition goes on and goes on and goes on  
  
(Chorus)  
Everybody needs it  
Everybody needs  
Everybody needs it  
Everybody needs  
  
And I get so blue when I'm stuck all day in school  
And I get so blue when I'm stuck all day in school  
And I stare at the back of my old notebook  
And the teacher gives me a dirty look  
And I've got just one thing on my mind  
No matter how hard I try and try  
I feel like someone else  
I feel like someone else  
  
Everybody needs  
  
Big boy, real cool, you can tell he's no one's fool  
And he tries so hard to come off like a star  
You can tell by the way he combs his hair  
By the cocky grin and that moody stare  
By the way he leans and juts out his hip  
And you think any second that he might slip  
But he feels like someone else  
And he feels like someone else  
I know what's on his mind  
I know what's on his mind  
  
(Repeat Chorus)  
  
And I'm gonna bet you that I know what's on your mind  
Pretty baby, I'm gonan bet you that I know what's on your mind  
  
Young girl, so wild, she wears a ponytail  
And she cooks inside with a passion she can't hide  
And she's got that ju-ju in her eyes  
Makes boys and old men come alive  
And she knows the power that she possesses  
When they start to melt under her caresses  
She feels like someone else  
She feels like someone else  
I know what's on her mind  
I know what's on her mind  
  
(Repeat Chorus)  
  
True love and virtue get put in a closet  
Like Jeckyll and Hyde, when it starts you can't stop it  
No need to feel guilty, 'cause you're not alone  
When the fire consumes you and nature takes over  
The heartache and true love and feeble excuses  
For repressed desires add fuel to the fire  
When the fire consumes you and nature takes over  
And the human condition goes on and goes on and goes on  
  
(Repeat Chorus)  
  
Everybody needs

Once there was a man who decided he knew everything  
Once there was a book that he threw in my face  
Once there was an angry mob that marched  
Up and down the street  
Don't ya know they all called my name  
What do they want from me?  
CHORUS  
What do they want from me?  
What do they want from me?  
What do they want from a poor boy who  
Can't believe  
They want to fill the void  
They want to fill the empty spaces  
But I won't let them consume me  
With the rest of the lifeless faces  
Once there was a little girl  
Who thought that she was a queen  
And she thought the world was a playground  
Filled with sand  
So with all her friends she created a fantasy  
They all come to me with their demands  
What do they want from me?  
CHORUS  
Every little thing is a piece of a larger thing  
Ever little fish is a tyrant of the sea  
Every little atom is a master of his family  
Every single piece calls my name  
What do they want from me?  
CHORUS  
  

Over time I've come to feel  
That everything must come apart it seems  
From the little child to the man of power  
From the beggar to the angel of my dreams  
From the thinnest thread we are sewn together  
From the finest string we dangle over time  
From the highest wire do we walk through fire  
Should our balance ever falter  
Should our steps be unaligned  
Such a big storm yeah such a strong wind blowing  
Such a loud voice calling for me to cross the line  
  
Chorus  
But I'm not gonna give up the ghost  
No, not gonna give up the ghost  
I'm not gonna give up the ghost, no not gonna give it up  
'Cause I haven't the strength to hold out too long  
If we both hold on together we can make each other strong  
  
After all we're flesh 'n' blood  
After all we're flesh 'n' blood  
After all we're flesh 'n' blood  
After all we're flesh  
After all we're flesh 'n' blood  
After all we're flesh 'n' blood  
After all we're flesh 'n' blood  
After all we're flesh  
  
Drop the mask take away the house  
And forget about the income and the car  
We're all the same underneath our shell  
We've all been to hell and we know what it's like  
And we've shared each other's sins  
We all know what it's like to give up the fight  
We've all been ashamed at one time or another  
We all have dreams and nightmares too  
  
When it all comes down we'll look out for each other  
(No one else will)  
But when I hear the call when I feel the thirst  
When the catcher comes to take my soul  
He's gonna have to fight me first  
  
Chorus  
  
Every cloud has a silver lining  
And every soul is tender to the touch  
We are made of stone, we are made of steel  
And we're all the same when we return to dust  
But when I hear the call when I feel the thirst  
When the catcher comes to take my soul  
He's gonna have to fight me first. ..  
  
Chorus out

They say you're stupid  
That you're too young to vote  
They say you'll swallow anything  
That they shove down your throat  
They say you can't think  
That you haven't got a brain  
That you're just there to listen  
That you're just being trained  
CHORUS  
There's something inside your head  
There's something inside your head  
There's something inside your head  
There's something inside your head  
They say you lost the ability to even think  
That your tiny little brain  
Slipped down the kitchen sink  
They say that you'll buy anything  
That they turn your way  
That you'll listen to everything  
That they decide to play  
CHORUS  
Grey matter grey matter ooh . . .  
Grey matter grey matter ooh . . .  
Grey matter grey matter ooh . . .  
Grey matter grey matter ooh . . .  
BRIDGE  
I think you like it--like it  
To be told what to do--isn't that true  
I think you're better--better--better off  
Stone cold dead--without your head  
They say you're stupid  
That you're too young to vote  
They say you'll swallow anything  
That they shove down your throat  
If they say lie down, you'll do it  
If they say--buy it now--you'll do it  
If they say--turn around--you'll do it  
If they say--hit the ground--you'll do it  
If they say--bite the big weenie--you'll do it  
If they say--wasn't that good--you'll do it  
If they say--bend over baby--you'll do it  
If they say--take it and like it--you'll do it  
CHORUS  

(I thought I heard somebody cry--  
I though I heard somebody cry)  
I went to see what I could find  
Like flowers in the dead of night  
Like shadows in the moonlight--  
I though I heard somebody cry  
A choir with a single voice--A picnic on a cliff  
Antenna like an insect--To pick up all your thoughts  
CHORUS  
It isn't true  
I am not the ghost  
Without a soul . . . Come  
Listen to my heart  
You feel the beat . . . Stop  
Listen to the sound  
Of moving feet . . . Walk  
Through the halls at night  
When I'm asleep  
I don't believe . . .I don't believe  
The shoe is on the other foot--The glove is on the fist  
The first is like a cannonball--But it feels like a kiss  
I got a bed that's real soft--In a room that's always sad  
I thought I heard a window sigh--  
I though I heard somebody cry  
CHORUS  
A choir with a single voice--a picnic on a cliff  
Antenna like an insect--To pick up all your thoughts  
I sip the running water--Like rivers from your eyes  
I thought I heard somebody cry--Somebody might be lost  
I thought I heard somebody cry--Somebody might be lost  
I thought I heard somebody cry--I thought I'd go and see  
I thought I heard somebody cry--Somebody might be me  
  

When you spend your whole life  
Building stone castles  
When the walls start to crumble  
Exposed to the world  
When the wind burns my face  
And the smoke burns my eyes  
I can't ever cry  
I can't ever cry  
CHORUS  
You gotta help . . .  
To make me somebody  
You gotta help . . .  
To open my eyes  
The temperature's rising  
How a cool drink would help  
I've been thirsty for years  
I've been thirsty for years  
I'm hungry for something . . .  
Just the touch of your flesh  
To sooth and refresh . . .  
To sooth and refresh.  
CHORUS  
  

Countless long nights  
While I stare at the wall  
I ask myself over again...  
How did I end up  
In this little hell?  
How - did it ever begin?  
Oh, oh, oh oh oh helpess  
Helpless to turn back the clock  
That ticks on  
With its cruel shiny face  
It laughs while it watches  
My every disgrace - I was  
Born a sap - all the  
Nurses laughed when they  
Saw me the first time  
They giggled and they said  
"This poor little monster'd be  
Better off dead."  
Oh, oh, oh oh oh helpess  
Helplessly trapped in a body  
I'm sure -  
Should have never been mine.  
I bet that my real one's  
Doing just fine - and I  
Don't belong here, I  
Don't belong here - I  
Should be quite rich  
With a big shiny car  
A house with twelve rooms  
I deserve to go far.  
Oh, oh, oh oh oh helpess  
Helplessly falling in love  
But does love  
Really last through the night?  
To love - To honor -  
To kick and to bite! and I  
Don't belong here, I  
Don't belong here  
It's all a mistake  
I was destined for greatness  
A leader, a prophet -  
They're just too blind to notice.  
Where did this whole silly story begin?  
It seems that my mind has gone -  
Blank.  
I think that I've messed up a chapter or two.  
Perhaps it is best if I'm frank!  
Oh, oh, oh oh oh helpess -  
Helplessly lost like that  
Poor chap who came  
For an innocent dance.  
He left with his brain smeared  
All over his pants! cause he  
Didn't belong here, he  
Didn't belong here  
He never should've left  
That warm cage in a zoo!  
His face was so ugly  
What else could I do?  
Can you - really blame me, I  
Had to smash it.  
He left me no choice,  
He was just like the others.  
I just had to kill him.  
With my poor, dear, old  
Mother.  
Oh, oh, oh oh oh helpess  
Helplessly fucked in the ass  
By a legion of forty ex-cons  
That's what it feels like  
When you walk all over me.  
Don't belong here, I  
Don't belong here  
Your eyes burn right through me.  
They fill me with fear.  
I could've been at home  
Watching football, and drinking beer.  
Oh, oh, oh oh oh helpess, so Helpless.  
  

Tiny insects in my hair  
Tiny insects everywhere  
Tiny insects in my pants  
Watching insects make romance  
Insects make me make me want to dance dance dance  
They make want to dance . . .  
Flying insects everywhere  
Flying insects buzzing buzzing buzzing through the air  
Just like little diamonds in the sky  
Insects buzzing in my eye  
Buzzing insects make me want to dance dance dance  
They make me want to dance . . .  
Insects crawling all around  
Insects squirming in the ground  
Insects gooey squeaky chewy  
Should I eat them--no  
I'd rather stomp them hurt them stomp  
Stomp them while I dance dance dance  
I hurt them while I dance dance dance  
I stomp them while I dance dance dance . . .  
Insects make me scream and shout  
They don't know what life's about  
They don't have blood  
They've got too many legs  
They don't have brains in their heads  
They know they'll rule the world some day  
They bite and sting me anyway  
They bite and sting and suck  
They bite and sting and suck suck suck  
They bite and sting and  
Suck suck suck suck suck . . .  
Dance dance dance  
  

Another place, another time  
Another face that looks mine  
Another soul for all to see  
Is this reality?  
If I could only find the words  
I dream that they won't go unheard  
With one exception I can see  
Is this reality?  
  
Oh, if I could only make time stand still for a moment  
Capture a memory live it one more time, would I believe  
That I would really change a thing  
A second chance to get it right  
I think the end is close at hand  
I had a vision I don't understand  
Don't you see, I was made for you and you for me  
Close your eyes, are you ready for a big surprise  
  
Oh, hold the clock say the words to make it stop now  
Slam bam thank you maam  
Wasn't it a pleasant life we shared, who really cares  
Why pretend you don't remember  
Wipe it clean and start it again  
Hope to see you in the summer.  
  
Another place, another time  
Another face that looks like mine  
Another soul for all to see  
Is this?  
Is this?  
Is this?

Island in the sea  
Are so much like me  
They don't ever change--no emotion, no emotion  
Islands on the land  
Dry like desert sand  
Island in the city  
All alone it's such a pity  
CHORUS  
It's just a masquerade  
Just painted laces  
When will it change  
Never  
Islands in the seas  
What's come over me  
We are both surrounded by the water--empty water  
Give me mystery--and the fear it brings  
Anything at all to break up the monotony  
CHORUS  
Islands in the sea  
Forever . . . forever  
  

I don't know why I feel this way  
I don't know if it's right or wrong to laugh at misfortune  
Darkness can never last too long  
  
Every time I think I'm falling  
And there's nobody around to hold me up  
And it seems like the world has come to an end  
I look for miles but not a face is friendly  
Then suddenly a hole opens up in the ground  
The bottom of the hole is a raging fire  
I try to jump over but there's no way  
The next thing I know, I'm going down  
  
[Chorus:]  
Does it hurt?  
Oh, it really doesn't matter  
Does it burn?  
Oh, I don't feel a thing  
Does it sting?  
Oh, yeah, it really doesn't matter  
Does it hurt?  
Oh, I don't give a damn  
When I find myself falling and I hit the bottom  
It only makes me laugh  
It only makes me laugh  
When I go down the hole and I hit the bottom  
  
The last time that I fell in love  
The love was milk and honey but the milk turned sour  
The woman became a monster  
And everyone I knew had become a stranger  
And the room went black and my luck was spent  
The floor opened up, down I went  
  
(Repeat Chorus)  
  
It only makes me laugh  
It only makes me laugh  
It only makes me laugh  
Coming right back  
Coming right back  
'Cause you can't keep me down  
Can't keep me down  
Oh, in the ground  
  
Does it hurt?  
Oh, it really doesn't matter  
Does it burn?  
Oh, I don't feel a thing  
I don't mind just a little pain  
Ooh, oh yeah  
Whoa...  
  
Remembering when I was a young man  
How everything seemed to turn against me  
I didn't know a soul, it was an alien place  
The sun was covered by a dark cloud  
And though I tried, I couldn't find a way to escape  
The only way to go was straight down  
  
(Repeat Chorus)  
  
It only makes me laugh  
It only makes me laugh  
It only makes me laugh  
It only makes me laugh  
  
I don't know why I feel this way  
I don't know if it's right or wrong to laugh at misfortune  
Darkness can never last too long...  
When you laugh in it's face  
When you laugh in it's face  
I don't know why I feel this way...

I work all day and I work all night 4x  
I work all day and I work all night  
I work so my wife and kids will have a pleasant life  
I work as many jobs as I can  
I'm proud to work I guess I'm just a working man  
-who am I to complain  
I live in the lap of luxury  
I got a car and a big tv that's so fine  
I go to the pictures when I can  
-the pictures take me to far-away lands  
-almost makes me forget who I am  
Sometimes at work I've a fantasy  
That I'm a man who livesa life of mystery  
(but) then the whistle brings me to  
I can't forget why I'm here, I've got a job to do  
-Responsibility- is much more important to a man like me  
I work all day and I work all night  
I work all day and I work all night - etc. etc.  
Guitar solo  
I got a job at the factory  
But I don't mind cause I know that the job is right for me  
I don't complain I'm satisfied  
And I don't care to rub elbows with the wealthy  
They've got their problems too, I don't envy them a bit don't ya know  
I'm doin' what I want and it ain't so bas  
I've got everything that a man could have  
(I'm) living in the lap of luxury - living in the lap of luxury  
Work all day and I work all night  
I work all day and I work all night etc. etc.

(Chorus)  
Hey, what's all the fuss about?  
Hey, what's all the fuss about?  
  
Hey, what's all the fuss about?  
Hey, what's all the fuss about?  
  
They say lightning, they say lightning  
Lightning never strikes twice in a row  
  
Generations, generations  
First they fight and then they forget  
What they were fighting about in the first place  
  
Here it comes, the big explosion  
Haven't I seen that once before  
Or is it just some deja vu  
Just some long forgotten dream  
Just some silly memory  
History does not repeat, it never, never does  
  
(Repeat Chorus)  
  
(Bridge)  
I should know  
I've been hit three times (or was it four?)  
I'm a walking testimony  
Come here, look at these holes  
I'm a walking testimony  
Just look at these holes, look at these holes!  
  
Generations, generations  
Fathers never teach their sons  
And grandpa never talked to them and so on  
  
Memories are inconvenient  
When there's lessons to be learned  
That just might rock the boat too much  
Cause anxiety and such  
We cannot walk without our crutches  
We cannot walk, we cannot walk, we never, never could  
  
(Repeat Chorus and Bridge)  
  
Hey, what's all the fuss about?  
Hey, what's all the fuss about?  
Hey, what's all the fuss about?  
Hey, what's all the fuss about?  
They say lightning, they say lightning  
Lightning never strikes twice in a row

I, I, I love little girls  
They make me feel so good  
I love, little girls  
They make me feel so bad  
  
When they're around  
They make me feel  
Like I'm the only guy in town  
  
I love, little girls  
They make me feel so good  
  
They don't care if I'm a one-way mirror  
They're not frightened by my cold exterior  
  
They don't, ask me questions  
They don't, want to scold me  
They don't, look for answers  
They just, want to hold me  
  
Isn't this fun?  
Isn't this what life's all about?  
Isn't this a dream come true?  
Isn't this a nightmare too?  
  
Oh, oh, oh I love little girls  
They make me feel so good  
I love, little girls  
They make me feel so, bad  
  
When they're around  
They make me feel  
Like I'm the only guy in town  
  
I love, little girls  
They make me feel so, good  
  
They don't care about my inclinations  
They're not frightened by my revelations  
  
Uh oh (uh oh), take a second (take a second)  
Uh oh (uh oh), it's a mistake (it's a mistake)  
Uh oh (uh oh), I'm in trouble (I'm in trouble)  
Uh oh (uh oh), the little girl was just too little  
Too little, too little, too little, too little  
  
Isn't this what life's all about?  
Isn't this a dream come true?  
Isn't this a nightmare too?  
  
And I don't care, what people say  
And I don't care, what people think  
And I don't care, how we look  
Walking down the street  
  
They make me feel so--  
I love, little girls  
  
They don't care if I'm a one-way mirror  
They don't care about my cold exterior  
  
They don't (they don't), ask me questions (ask me questions)  
They don't (they don't), want to scold me (want to scold me)  
They don't (they don't), look for answers (look for answers)  
They just (they just), want to hold me (want to hold me)  
  
Uh oh (uh oh), I'm in trouble (I'm in trouble)  
Uh oh (uh oh), the little girls was just too little  
Too little, too little, too little, too little  
Too little, too little, too little, too little  
  
Isn't this what life's all about?  
Isn't this a dream come true?  
Isn't this a nightmare too?  
  
Oh, oh, oh, I, I, I love little girls  
They make me feel so good  
I love, little girls  
They make me feel so, bad  
  
When they're around  
They make me feel  
Like I'm the only guy in town  
  
I love (I love), little girls  
They make me feel so good  
I love

I'm standing all alone out in the pouring rain  
And though it really isn't like me to complain  
I think I'm getting used to it  
I feel happy, and I also feel bad  
I've never been here, but somehow I think I have  
But I'm getting used to it  
  
I've never been lost like this  
I've never been lost like this  
But I wouldn't be happy anywhere else  
Nobody to tell us what to do all by ourselves  
  
Don't know how I got here and I don't know why I stay  
The poets all around are laughing in their graves  
Must be something that I said  
This place is not like anything I've seen before  
The spirits move around, the houses have no doors  
But I'm getting used to it  
  
I've never been lost like this  
I've never been lost like this  
But I wouldn't be happy anywhere else  
Nobody to tell us what to do all by ourselves  
  
Isn't this a fine hello  
I wish I hadn't seen you go  
It's always been a bitter pill  
The broken mirror's broken still  
The letters never made the post  
A thousand more I never wrote  
And here on dark, unfriendly streets  
I find the comfort that I seek  
And I'm happy, and I've been happy  
  
I've never been lost like this  
I've never been lost like this  
But I wouldn't be happy anywhere else  
Nobody to tell us what to do all by ourselves  
  
I've never been lost like this  
I've never been lost like this  
But I wouldn't be, ha  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah wo wo yeah yeah yeah yeah

Mama  
Please be good, please be good to me  
Mama  
Please be good, please be good to me  
Mama  
Hovering over me at night  
Mama  
Comfort me, make me feel all right  
I walk alone and see what boys should never  
See in their lifetime  
I live in the world of spirits  
And I talk to the walls  
Deliver me from  
This little hell  
Deliver me from  
This little hell  
Deliver me from  
Mama  
Come and take, come and take my hand  
Mama  
Try and see, try to understand  
Mama  
Looking through, looking through my eyes  
Mama  
Everywhere, always in disguise  
I walk alone and see what boys should never  
See in their lifetime  
I live in the world of spirits  
And I talk to the walls  
Deliver me from  
This little hell  
Deliver me from  
This little hell  
Deliver me from  
Mama  
Please be good, please be good to me  
Mama  
Please be good, please be good to me  
I walk alone and see what boys should never see  
I hear what boys should never hear  
In their lifetime  
I live in the world of spirits  
And I talk to the walls  
Deliver me from  
This little hell  
Deliver me from  
This little hell  
Deliver me from  
Mama  
Please be good . . .  
  

Oh Mary was unhappy with the life that she led  
She was a simple girl without much to say  
So one day she upped and left her dreary home  
And she left all her friends to wander all alone  
And at first she was afraid, she was so far away  
From her home but slowly she got to like it anyway  
  
Oh Mary won't you please come  
Mary won't you please come  
Mary won't you please come  
  
Well in time she found  
That mountain that she had been taught  
Her whole life, that she must avoid  
And though at first it hurt, and no one could comfort her  
She finally came to appreciate it  
And she liked it, she liked it--oh wasn't she surprised  
And though still alone, she grew so much inside  
  
Oh Mary won't you please come  
Mary won't you please come  
Mary won't you please come  
  
And after a time, she became so sublime  
She could look in people's eyes and read their minds  
Though her hands would sometimes bleed and occasionally  
She would long for her past and the memories they bring  
She decided to return to her old home town  
And her heart was burning with all the things she found  
  
Oh Mary won't you please come  
Mary won't you please come  
Mary won't you please come  
Please come home  
  
So Mary came back and at first no one recognized her face  
And her friends were all a little bit afraid  
When they heard what she had to say  
They all slowly backed away  
And her family took her aside and put their arms around her  
They said:  
Mary, won't you please come back to us now  
There is still time to repent for all your sins  
And Mary started to cry when she realized  
That she'd never come home again in her life  
  
Oh Mary won't you please come  
Mary won't you please come  
Mary won't you please come  
Please come home  
Come home, yeah yeah yeah  
Come home, home  
Come home, yeah yeah yeah  
Come home, yeah yeah yeah  
Come home, home  
Come home, yeah yeah yeah  
Come home, yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah....

I would really like to know you better  
But sometimes I'm afraid that it's not meant to be  
I would like to believe in something higher  
But I can't get a grip on all the little things  
  
When the night comes I cannot sit still you see  
And the years they have not been so kind to me  
Got a gallery of figures standing all in a row  
And every single figure has a soul of its own  
But I never look back  
Never look back  
Don't turn your back on me  
  
(Chorus)  
(Hey yeah) My life has come unraveled again  
Like so many threads  
(Hey yeah) my life has begun unfolding  
In so many pieces  
(Hey yeah) my life has come unraveled again like  
So many threads in the wind - drift away - drift away  
  
There's a time and a place  
For understanding  
And a time when action speaks louder than words  
And I don't seem to get no indications  
And I don't know how to get through to you  
And when time like the pyramids  
Has worn away  
All the mountains and the valleys  
Of the words that we say  
  
We have got to make sure that something remains  
If we lose each other we've got no one to blame  
So never look back  
Never look back  
Don't turn your back on me  
  
(Chorus)

Here's something to think about  
Where would we be now without  
Nasty habits, nasty habits  
Makes me want to scream and shout  
Life would be so dull without  
Nasty habits, nasty habits  
  
All those naughty little things  
That we don't discuss publicly  
Nasty habits, nasty habits  
Tell me your secrets, tell me your name  
Tell me your secrets  
  
Does it please you to employ  
Little girls or little boys  
Nasty habits, nasty habits  
Do you like to romp and play  
By yourself when they're away  
Nasty affair what do I care  
  
Do you peek at magazines  
Filled with doggies and leather queens  
Nasty habits, nasty habits  
Tell me your secrets that no one should hear  
Whisper them softly into my ear  
I won't tell, I won't tell  
  
People act so proper when they're going 'bout their business  
Cup of coffee, friendly conversation  
'Til they get home  
'Til they get home  
Turn the phone off, lock the door and shut the curtains  
Make sure that the neighbors are without suspicion  
No one will know  
No one will know  
  
Nasty habits I must condone  
No one knows what I do when I'm all alone  
Nasty habits I'm so ashamed  
  
Nasty habits here to stay  
Now they'll never go away  
Try and stop you'll have to pay  
Nasty habits are here to stay  
  
People act so proper when they're going 'bout their business  
Cup of coffee, friendly conversation  
'Til they get home  
'Til they get home  
Take the phone off, lock the door and shut the curtains  
Make sure that the neighbors are without suspicion  
No one will know  
No one will know  
  
Nasty habits I must condone  
No one knows what I do when I'm all alone  
Nasty habits I'm so ashamed  
But we must not let that stop our little game  
Nasty habits are so much fun  
  
Nasty habits here to stay  
Now they'll never go away  
Try and stop you'll have to pay  
Nasty habits are here to stay

People raise your voices, don't get caught in that mess  
Like a fly in a spider's web, is it true more is less  
Herded like a happy flock to the big T.V. slaughter  
"Why don't you break that leash," said the heifer to the sheep  
It's a new generation  
It's a hallucination  
It's a mystic vibration  
It's just intimidation  
It's the will of the people  
It's the church with the steeple  
It's the sacred devotion  
To an unhealthy notion  
People raise your voices, don't get into that trap  
If your friends and your neighbors push  
Why don't you push them back  
Don't you think the time has come  
To stand up and be heard  
Ain't no use to try and wait  
For the magic word  
It's a new generation  
It's an infatuation  
It's a beautiful body  
Both erotic and deadly  
It's the fear of the future  
It's just surgeons and sutures  
It's a spandex obsession  
It's a lasting impression  
Do you feel the power  
Do you feel the power  
Baptized in electronic water  
Prodigal sons and beautiful daughters  
With smiles and bows and rosy cheeks  
And the righteous bath  
Death to the freaks  
Do you feel the power  
Do you feel the power  
From the man whose voice sounds reassuring  
Completely firm and so alluring, Like's he's lived a thousand times before  
And seen the world from shore to shore  
With the calmness and tranquility that oozes credibility  
With the wisdom and the confidence that seem to scream out common sense  
And it makes you feel just like a babe  
Daddy holding you tight and safe  
Hush babe everything's all right, Daddy's gonna stay with you tonight  
Now he's got you by the balls, he can sell you anything at all  
From morality to diamond rings to genocide to magazines  
From religion to cosmology to the end of a democracy  
It's a new generation  
It's a divine inspiration  
Always ready to follow  
Ever willing to swallow  
All the doctor's prescriptions  
All the mystic inscriptions  
It's the spandex obsession  
It's a lasting impression  
It's the calm meditation  
Of a tranquilized nation  
It's a hallucination  
It's a new generation  
  

You worry too much  
You make yourself sad  
You can't change fate  
But don't feel so bad  
Enjoy it while you can  
It's just like the weather  
So quit complaining brother  
No one lives forever  
  
Let's have a party there's a full moon in the sky  
It's the hour of the wolf and I don't want to' die  
  
I'm so happy  
Dancing while the Grim Reaper  
Cuts cuts cuts but he can't catch me  
I'm clever as can be  
And I'm very quick  
But don't forget  
You've only got so many tricks  
No one lives forever  
  
You think you've got it rough  
What about your darling doggie  
Ten short years  
And he's getting old and groggy  
I don't think it's very fair  
Cold Chop Low  
But it's all relative my friend cause  
No one lives forever  
  
Let's have a party there's a full moon in the sky  
It's the hour of the wolf and I don't want to' die  
  
I'm so happy  
Dancing while the Grim Reaper  
Cuts cuts cuts but he can't catch me  
I'm clever as can be  
And I'm very quick  
But don't forget  
You've only got so many tricks  
No one lives forever  
  
You worry too much  
You make yourself sad  
You can't change fate  
But don't feel so bad  
Enjoy it while you can  
It's just like the weather  
So quit complaining brother  
No one lives forever  
  
Let's have a party there's a full moon in the sky  
It's the hour of the wolf and I don't want to' die  
  
No one beats him at his game  
For very long but just the same  
Who cares there's no place safe to hide  
Nowhere to run no time to cry  
So celebrate why you still can  
Cause any second it may end  
And when it's all been said and done  
Better that you had some fun  
Instead of hiding in a shell  
Why make your life a living hell?  
Drink a toast, down the cup  
Drink to bones that turn to dust  
  
Cause  
No one, no one, no one...  
No one lives forever!

Johnny was bad, even as a child everybody could tell,  
Everyone said, "If you don't get straight  
You'll surely go to hell."  
  
But Johnny didn't care,  
He was an outlaw by the time that he was ten years old,  
He didn't want to do what he was told  
Just a prankster, juvenile gangster.  
  
His teachers didn't understand,  
They kicked him out of school at a tender early age,  
Just because he didn't want to learn things  
He had other interests  
He liked to burn things!  
  
The lady down the block,  
She had a radio that Johnny wanted oh so bad,  
So he took it the first chance he had.  
Then he shot her in the leg,  
And this is what she said  
"Only a lad. You really can't blame him."  
"Only a lad. Society made him."  
"Only a lad. He's our responsibility."  
Oh, oh, oohh oh oh oh  
"Only a lad. He really couldn't help it."  
"Only a lad. He didn't want to do it."  
"Only a lad. He's underprivileged and abused."  
Perhaps a little bit confused?  
  
Oh oh ohhh, oohhh oh oh ohh whoa whoa whoa  
Oh oh ohhh, oohhh oh oh ohh whoa whoa whoa  
  
His parents gave up, they couldn't influence his attitude,  
Nobody could help.  
The little man had no gratitude.  
  
And when he stole the car,  
Nobody dreamed that he would try to take it so far.  
He didn't mean to hit the poor man,  
Who had to go and die.  
It made the judge cry.  
  
"Only a lad. He really couldn't help it."  
"Only a lad. He didn't want to do it."  
"Only a lad. He's underprivileged and abused."  
Perhaps a little bit confused?  
Oh oh oh, ohh ohh ohh  
  
It's not his fault that he can't believe,  
It's not his fault that he can't behave,  
Society made him go astray.  
  
Perhaps if we're nice he'll go away,  
Perhaps he'll go away,  
He'll go away  
  
"Only a lad. You really can't blame him."  
"Only a lad. Society made him."  
"Only a lad. He's our responsibility."  
  
Hey there Johnny you really don't fool me,  
You get away with murder,  
And you think it's funny!  
You don't give a damn if we live or if we die  
Oh oh oh, ohh ohh ohh oh oh,  
Hey there Johnny boy,  
I hope you fry!  
  
Oh oh oh, ohh ohh ohh oh oh,  
Oh oh oh, ohh ohh ohh oh oh.

May the memories not be forgot  
May we never lose our mind  
May no one tamper with our thoughts  
For the sake of open eyes  
  
For open eyes my dear  
For open eyes  
We will not drink to blindness dear  
We'll drink to open eyes!  
  
The mindless cretin on parade  
They may fill our lives with fear  
Should we forgive and look away  
Well perhaps, but not this year!  
  
For open eyes my dear  
For open eyes  
We will not drink to blindness deat  
We'll drink to open eyes  
  
Our enemies may come on strong  
They may try to break our will  
Should we forgive and look away  
Just before we spring to kill!  
  
For open eyes my dear  
For open eyes  
We will not drink to blindness dear

My situation never changes - or very little  
My little world -- my little world--is due for a shakeup  
Or a shakedown would be acceptable  
And I can't understand--can't understand  
Why people think I'm so respectable  
I believe, I believe, I believe  
Outrageous, outrageous, outrageous  
Outrageous things are gonna happen to me  
They're gonna happen to the other side  
They're gonna happen to somebody  
It's gonna happen to the kids to the people next door  
And it really isn't funny  
And I said my situation never changes  
But I'm not too sure  
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe  
That something's gonna happen real soon (something scary)  
I know, I know, I know  
Outrageous, outrageous, outrageous  
Outrageous things are gonna happen to me  
They're gonna happen to me.  
Everywhere I go--outrageous  
Everything I see  
Everytime I talk--outrageous  
I'm gettin into trouble  
Open my big mouth--outrageous  
Words keep fallin out  
Open my big mouth--outrageous  
Now I'm in trouble  
I believe, I believe, I believe  
  

Pictures of you  
It's just pictures of you, through the bedroom door  
With that sly little grin, says you want it some more  
But there's people around, and they don't look so nice  
Tell me why don't they move, this has happened before  
This has happened before  
It's just pictures of you  
In darkness  
  
Pictures of you  
I'd been sleeping for hours,  
when you came to my house  
You'd been lost in a crowd, said you had to get out  
You were covered with tears and you said you were sad  
So you wanted to play  
Yes, you wanted to play  
Well you touched me and smiled, as you let yourself go  
Oh, but something was wrong, 'cause your touch was so cold  
Like you'd been in the ground and you asked if you could  
Stay  
And I said no!  
It's just pictures of you  
In darkness  
  
(Pictures of you)  
In that lovely white dress, oh your skin was so white  
With the moon in your eyes, on that cold winter night  
When your lips were so soft, that I though they would  
Melt,  
And the sound of your breath and the way that you felt  
And I said yes  
And I said yes  
It's just pictures of you with a knife in your hand  
With a rose in your teeth lying nude in the sand  
It's just pictures of you, standing high on a cliff  
With the wind in your hair, and a smile on your lips  
And your eyes were so wild, when you started to laugh  
Blending in with the wind, sounded just like a scream  
Why do pictures of you  
Come to me when I dream  
In darkness  
  
Pictures of you  
Pictures of you  
Pictures of you

Piggy met baby in a disco bar  
Baby said, what a cute little piggy you are  
When he took one look at her rocket tits  
He smiled real wide and said "Baby, you're it"  
Piggy said baby won't you come with me  
My little place is three steps away  
Piggy gonna take us both to paradise  
He said "Come on little baby, won't you please be nice"  
So Piggy and Baby sauntered into his crib  
Said, "here it is baby, this is where I live"  
Won't you take a load off, can I fix you a drink  
Baby turned real slowly and said, "Piggy you stink"  
Piggy said baby, do you have a smoke?  
Baby said no, she was tryin to quit  
Piggy was speechless for a couple of beats  
When his jaw dropped open and he said... "shit"  
Now Piggy and Baby had some swingin times  
And though piggy was stupid,  
Baby sure didn't mind  
Baby said, "lets go straight to the stars"  
And Piggy said  
"huh? .... whatever"  
Baby and Piggy took a walk in the park  
It seems that Piggy was in kind of a fix  
He owed seven bills to a couple of sharks  
Who were gettin kind of itchy in their finger-tips  
So they figured it was best to clear out for a while  
Piggy had lots of friends, or so he would boast  
And his little piggy habit was kind of out of control  
So they packed up his Lincoln, and head for the coast  
Baby started smokin again on the way  
Piggy's little habit was making him sweat  
So they stopped off in Vegas for a couple of days  
To scam some cash up and make a few bets  
They went and shacked up in a place on the strip  
Piggy made some calls and Baby got sick  
Baby turned to Piggy with a desperate plea  
"c'mon Piggy, you know what we need"  
But the problem, you see, was that they were broke as shit  
So Piggy asked Baby if she'd turn a few tricks  
She argued at first, but she finally agreed  
With a couple of shiners, she hit the street  
Now Piggy felt good, and piggy felt mean  
And Piggy was high on his self esteem  
So he pulled out his piece, in front of a cop  
But the cop said "Fuck you" and Piggy got popped  

This is my private life  
I have no friends to fear  
I've got no problems no cross to bear  
If you can find me  
Come and get me out of here  
  
This is my private life  
This is my private life  
This is my private life  
  
These are my private things  
There they are against the wall  
The dirty pictures, religious objects  
These are my private things  
Come and get them out of here  
  
This is my private bed  
This is where I lie at night  
Staring at a light bulb hanging on the ceiling  
Waiting for a dream to  
Come and get me out of here  
  
Here in my humble room at night  
I often wonder what goes on out there  
What makes them runs o scared  
I often stare at the people passing by  
But they can't see me through my window shades  
Just like I'm not even there  
  
This is my private life  
This is my private life  
This is my private life  
There's something dangerous I like  
  
This is my private life  
I know my problems aren't your fault  
What I really want to know  
Has it always been this way  
  
This is my private life  
This is my private life  
This is my private life  
Come and get me out of here

Reptiles and Samurai  
Inhabit my head  
Invading my dreams  
Sleeping in my bed  
They battle but they never die  
  
They hear what I hear  
Watching through my eyes  
They don't like what they see  
  
Reptiles and Samurai  
Are under my skin  
They hide in my mind  
They speak with my tongue  
They run amuck in my terrain  
  
They are not friends  
But they are forced reluctantly  
To share my brain  
  
Reptiles have silly grins  
Dark eyes shiny teeth some have fins  
Samurai they smile never  
Serious pretty swords very clever  
  
Sometimes I watch you from this place way in the sky  
Your face is young and shiny transformed right before my eyes  
Without warning, without reason  
To Samurais and lizards  
Reptiles and Samurai  
Samurais and lizards  
Reptiles and Samurai  
  
Reptiles and Samurai  
Inhabit my head  
Invading my dreams  
Sleeping in my bed  
They battle but they never die  
  
Reptiles have pretty scales  
They run real fast they like to bite some have tails  
Samurai like their water hot  
Very brave they eat raw fish they fight a lot  
  
Sometimes I watch you from this place way in the sky  
Your face is young and shiny transformed right before my eyes  
Without warning, without reason  
To Samurais and lizards  
Reptiles and Samurai  
Samurai and lizards  
Reptiles and Samurai  
  
Reptiles and Samurai  
Reptiles and Samurai  
Samurai

On a cool dark night someone's coming down the street  
With a smoking gun and a smile on his face  
For all to see, the rest is history  
But no one knows what's on his mind  
Except him and his monkey, come on  
  
When the big man fell with a secret on his lips  
So close, so close  
'Til the bullet gave his kiss  
The world cried out loud, the rest is history  
And no one knows what's on his mind  
Except him and his monkey come on  
  
You've got a right to know  
You've got a right to know  
You've got a right to know  
You've got a right to believe that there's something more to see  
  
There's a man at the desk who is talking real soft  
To a half dozen guys but not a word is lost  
The men depart they all know what to do  
With a rifle aiming through a clearing in a bush  
So close, so close, but no one thinks to look  
  
You've got a right to know  
You've got a right to know  
You've got a right to know  
You've got a right to believe that there's something more to see  
Than a big bunch of flowers in a cemetery  
So why hold out, come on and give your testimony  
  
On a phone connection on the other side of town  
Sits a man with a pencil who doesn't make a sound  
He nods his head, the rest is history  
But no one knows what's on his mind  
Except him and his monkey come on, come on  
  
When the big man fell with a secret on his lips  
So close, so close  
'Til the bullet gave his kiss  
  
You've got a right to know  
You've got a right to know  
You've got a right to know  
You've got a right to believe that there's something more to see  
Than a big bunch of flowers in a cemetery  
So why hold out, come on and give your testimony  
  
On a cool dark night someone's coming down the street

You've got me so I'm running round and round in circles.  
You've got me so I can't see my own face.  
You've got me so I feel like I've been like this forever.  
You've got me so I'm crazy with disgrace.  
(Chorus)  
I know what's on your mind  
But its not what you think it is.  
I know what's on your mind  
But its not what you think it is.  
I'm running on a treadmill after you  
I'm running on a treadmill now.  
I'm running on a treadmill after you  
I'm running on a treadmill now.  
You've got me so I'm running round and round in circles.  
You've got me so I can't see my own face.  
You've got me so I feel like I've been like this forever.  
You've got me so I'm crazy with disgrace.  
(Repeat Chorus)  
  

I'm not the same man I was before  
I haven't changed my perception  
I haven't lost my protection  
I haven't lost, haven't lost, haven't lost  
What I have, lost intentions  
Two by two coming through the door  
(Singing like a bird)  
Boys and girls voices joined in song  
(Voices in the air)  
Fire crackers making so much noise  
(Flying in the air)  
They all start yelling at me  
. . . . . Everything you do is wrong  
I'm not the same boy I was before  
But I've not changed my desires  
I've not extinguished the fires  
I haven't lost wide eyed wonder  
I haven't lost, haven't lost, haven't lost  
The stupid fear of thunder  
Two by two walking hand in hand  
(Walkin' in the air)  
The bone come marching from the promised land  
(Comes from everywhere)  
Their voices carry like the sound of glass  
(Breaking on the ground)  
It burns my ears when they sing  
. . . . . Everything you do is wrong  
I'm not the same ghost I was before  
But I still converse with the spirits  
When people talk I don't hear it  
I walk through doors when no one sees me  
I disappear, I disappear, disappear  
Whenever it may please me  
  

This is someone else's story  
Someone that I never knew  
This is someone else's body  
Am I getting through to you  
If you peel away the armor is something underneath  
If you look below for hidden treasure underneath another layer  
Are you hiding underneath the skin  
CHORUS  
If you peel away the skin is there anybody there  
If you peel away the skin is there anybody there  
If you peel away the armor is it too late to begin  
Is there anybody hiding if you peel away the skin  
Now a spark has passed between us now  
A momentary recognition  
Something lost and something gained  
And something shared that feels strange  
Something cold that will not go away  
There's a heart as cold as ice  
In a vault that's made of stone  
Over years the walls got higher  
Over years the walls have grown  
  
Is there anybody in there in this self inflicted tomb  
If you peel away the layers is there someone in this room  
If you peel away the skin, if you peel away the skin  
This is someone else's story  
Someone that I never knew  
This is someone else's body  
Am I getting through to you  
  

Spider crawling, on the wall  
I see him and he, sees it all...  
And he sees it all  
I fell down in that lazy place,  
Where the English language can't - penetrate and I  
Saw your mouth moving - just forget it and lie here with me  
Maybe we should just, climb under the sheets  
Where the words they don't get in the way  
We were wondering, if you recall  
Is this the end of it - end of everything  
We were wondering, wonder  
Spider crawling - in my left ear  
Has a message I - want you to hear  
Hope you're happy - found what you're looking for  
Do you miss me, miss me at all?  
Spider tells me, saw you yesterday  
With somebody new - what can I say?  
What can I...  
Spider crawling, I crawl with him -  
We go everywhere, we see everything  
We are falling, we are falling, falling to nowhere  
Hope you're happy - found what you're looking for  
Do you miss me, miss me at all?  
Spider crawling, spider crawling, spider crawling...  
  

This is not the first time you tried to get away,  
This is not a party where people know your name,  
This is not a classroom with teacher at the board,  
This is not a game show with prizes at the door.  
  
Go, don't you go,  
Won't you stay with me one more day?  
If we get through one more night,  
If we get through one more night,  
  
This is not a horse race where winners beat the time,  
This is not a funeral with mourners in a line,  
This is not a sitcom where everything's alright,  
This is not a prison with terror through the night.  
  
Go... don't you go,  
Won't you stay with me one more day?  
If we get through one more night,  
If we get through one more night,  
  
This is not the first time you tried to get away,  
This is not a party where people know your name,  
This is not a classroom with teacher at the board,  
This is not a game show with prizes at the door.  
  
Go... don't you go,  
Won't you stay with me one more day?  
If we get through one more night,  
If we get through one more night,  
  
[repeat chorus]  
  
This is not the first time you tried to get away,  
This is not a party where people know your name,  
  
Oh... where people know your name,

And I've always been a sucker for mystery  
And I've always been a sucker for mystery  
And I've always been a sucker for mystery  
And I've always been a sucker for mystery  
  
So I turn to the left and I turn to the right  
But none of the answers are in sight  
So I made a mistake maybe once or twice  
And I can't even get to paradise  
And a priest came up to me and touched my face  
He said terrible things happen round this place  
Such terrible things happen round this place  
Such terrible things happen round this place  
No demon, no man has got a clue  
But surely son, the end will turn out right for you  
'Cause I've always been a sucker for mystery  
And I've always been a sucker for mystery  
  
There's a little boy walking up the stairs  
Through a dark hallway that leads nowhere  
He comes to a door but he's afraid to knock  
And he bends down low and peers throught the lock  
And there's a tall man standing with a glistening knife  
And he's stooping over something that has no life  
With stifled tears he starts to turn away  
But a strange little voice seems to whisper  
"Stay!"  
He's always been a sucker for mystery  
And he's always been...  
  
(Chorus)  
I don't want to say good bye  
I want to give it one more try  
I don't want to say good bye  
I want to give it one more try  
  
Won't somebody help  
Won't somebody help  
I'm all alone now with nothing to do  
And I'm all dressed up with nowhere to go  
And I'm stuck with two tickets to an awful show  
And my mouth's full of words but I've got nothing to say  
And I've been sitting in front of the TV set all day  
And my head's in a vice and it won't let up  
And my feet won't move and if that ain't enough  
The telephone rings... "Hello!"  
  
I've seen children with such angry faces  
When you look in their eyes, it makes you want to cry  
There's a time and a place for everything  
There's a time and a place for everything  
  
Now it doesn't seem fair  
But who cares they're someone else's  
As long as they don't come close to mine  
There's a time and a place for everything  
There's a time and a place for everything  
  
So we packed our bags and went back to the hotel  
In back of the squalor and the living hell  
And they sell you this and they sell you that  
They sell you their sister for a buck and a half  
Such terrible things happen round this place  
Such terrible things happen round this place  
Such terrible things happen round this place  
And people disappear without a trace  
And I've always been a sucker for mystery  
And I've always been...  
  
Well the mystery that intrigues me the most  
Is the one that makes men give up hope  
The pride and the search for even little things  
That might give a meaning, or even a hint  
Cause how can a free man not have hope  
When he hasn't even reached the end of his rope  
  
I don't want to say good bye  
I want to give it one more try  
I don't want to close the gate  
I still think that it's not too late  
I know when I reach the end  
I want to start all over again  
  
And I've always been a sucker for mystery...

Walk with my eyes closed  
I bump my head  
Look at the stars falling on the ground  
Saw someone crawling underneath my bed  
Looked in the mirror caught my reflection, said oh...  
  
Just take your medicine  
Just take your medicine  
And don't complain if it don't taste good  
Just take your medicine  
Just take your medicine  
If it don't do the trick then I know what will  
  
Open the paper  
Eat ham and eggs  
Java in a cup  
Middle of the front page  
I saw a man with a gun  
Pointing at his head  
Eyes in the camera  
I can almost hear him say, oh...  
  
Just take your medicine  
Just take your medicine  
And don't complain if it don't taste good  
Just take your medicine  
Just take your medicine  
If it don't kill ya first then I know what will  
  
I met an angel  
Come from above  
I buy her everything  
Could this be love?  
She gives me sweet dreams and nightmares too  
Early in the morning she whispers in my ear, oh...  
  
[Chorus:]

Now it's the last time to remember what you said to me  
And I'm the last person in the world I thought I'd be  
And now it's high time to be something bigger than we are  
It's never too late to reverse a thing that's gone too far  
  
(1st Chorus)  
And I think the whole world's laughing at us  
But I don't care, that's not the point  
There's so much more  
There's so much more than meets the eye  
Oh, when you're around I'm blind  
  
Now it's the last time to leave the shadows far behind  
And it's the last time to clear the cobwebs from our mind  
And it's the last time to bury all our memories  
And it's the last time before everything just fades away  
  
(2nd Chorus)  
And I wish that you were here with me  
And I wish that somehow things would change  
You'd lose your fear of me  
And I feel that things might be okay  
Oh, wouldn't that be strange  
  
Now it's the last time to reconsider what we've done  
And it's the last time to start all over from day one  
  
(Repeat 2nd Chorus)  
  
(Repeat 1st Chorus)

Mr. Macho loves his women with such dedication  
Second only to his car that drives as fast as light  
On a highway bad jet fighters come from all directions  
Shooting verbal missiles, find their target right on sight, right on sight  
  
In the office things get rough as action is diminished  
Staring at a paper he is lost inside his head  
Dreaming of a battlefield with guns and ammunition  
All around, the bodies of the wounded and the dead, and the dead  
  
[Chorus:]  
'Cause he's tough as nails  
He's tough as nails  
He's tough as nails  
He's tough as nails  
  
He's such a live wire  
He's such a live wire  
He's such a live wire  
He's such a live wire  
  
Now it's time for football and a bout with heavy drinking  
Holding so much liquor makes him feel like a man  
As he drifts out on the sea on a ship that's slowly sinking  
Quietly salutes himself and the courage he once had, he once had  
  
(Repeat Chorus)  
  
Walking round and round in circles  
Waking up in a cold sweat  
Falling down a stairway and the tv dinner's not done yet  
Smash a window, crash a car  
And buy a pair of leather shoes  
Take a sweetheart to a movie  
Cash a check and pay some dues  
  
He's such a live wire  
He's such a live wire  
He's such a live wire  
He's such a live wire  
  
(Repeat Chorus)  
  
Walking round and round in circles...

Well I wish real hard when I close my eyes  
If I could change the world--would I even try  
If I found a reason to regain my pride  
Oh if I try to believe--try to believe  
  
[CHORUS]  
It's so hard to find an answer  
It's so hard to stand alone  
It's so hard to find a feeling  
That was buried long ago  
It's so hard to trust another  
When it's easier to hide  
It's so hard to believe  
Unless we try baby try  
  
If I had a dream and it got away  
If I found the words would I know what to say  
If I had a chance to be someone else  
Yeah if I try to believe, try to believe  
  
[CHORUS]  
  
If I found a door I've never been through  
Would I have the courage to go in without you  
(Try To Believe)  
And if time runs short would I recognize  
The things I couldn't see  
If I try to believe--try to believe  
  
If we listen to the voices that were silent for so long  
If you thought they went away, well you couldn't be more wrong  
If I tell you there is something that we've lost but can retrieve  
If I tell you there is hope, if we try to believe  
You remember there's a dream that we long since put aside  
With the toys that we discarded  
And the tears we never cried  
We could have had it once again, if we try baby try

Say boys and girls don't you want to have fun  
Why bother to walk when you'd rather run  
Why bother with books when you've got a gun  
Come fly with me right into the sun  
In another world, in another time  
I can picture you and me together  
If I close my eyes tight and think real hard  
I can float lighter than a feather  
If I try even harder who knows what I might find  
Why maybe a pearl of wisdom  
I would trade these pearls for a parcel of flesh  
In flesh we were all invented  
Is it time to play? Said the ratboy to the ratgirl  
Can we fly today, can we look here for some fresh kill  
In concentric circles we'll carve up the sky  
Looking for a big surprise  
Fly like a vulture, fly like a vulture....  
In another world, in another time  
I can picture us a happy family  
With our happy kids all flying all around  
And leaving far behind the rat-race  
Is it time to play? Said the tortoise to the rabbit  
Can we fly today, are we creatures all of habit  
In concentric circles we'll carve up the sky  
Waiting for a big surprise  
Fly like a vulture, fly like a vulture...  
Say boys and girls don't you want to have fun  
Why bother to crawl when you'd rather run  
Why bother to walk when you'd rather fly  
Come join the party way up in the sky  
Is it time to play? Said the ratboy to the ratgirl  
Can we fly today, can we look here for some fresh kill  
In concentric circles we'll carve up the sky  
Looking for a big surprise  
Fly like a vulture, fly like a vulture...

Wake up! Won't you listen to me  
Wake up! Won't you listen to me  
Won't you listen to me  
Wake up! Won't you listen to me  
Wake up! Won't you listen to me  
Won't you listen to me  
  
Big brother's watching, we watch him back  
We see right through his disguise  
He tries to scare us, with angry words  
But we all know that they're lies  
Whole world is waiting  
Just see the fear in their eyes  
  
Whole world is watching, observing every move  
Is it beginning or the end?  
Just like a chess game, but so intense  
That I just don't understand  
Anticipation  
It's much to big to pretend  
  
Chorus  
(wake up), it's 1984  
(wake up), but we've been here before  
(wake up), it's 1984  
(wake up), but we've been here before, (here before)  
  
Big brother's screaming but we don't care  
Cause he's got nothing to say  
Think of the future, think of the prophecy  
Think of the children of today  
Big brother's marching  
So we all stand in his way  
Open your eyes, sisters and brothers  
Neatly disguised, so far away  
Open your heart, try to remember  
Two worlds apart, but so close  
  
(wake up), it's 1984  
But we've been here before  
(wake up), it's 1984  
But we've been here before  
All our lives leading up to this day, watching and waiting  
  
Wake up! Wake up!  
Wake up! Wake up!  
  
Open your eyes, sisters and brothers  
Neatly disguised, so far away  
Open your heart, try to remember  
Two worlds apart, but so close  
  
Chorus  
  
Whole world is watching  
Anticipating  
Big brother's marching  
Is it beginning or the end?  
  
Chorus

Now, everybody tells you're the dog's best friend  
I'm the cat's meow since I don't know when  
I'm an instigator from a dead man's town  
So when did the whole world turn upside down?  
When did you change your mind?  
When did you lose the juice?  
Now, where did you get your attitude?  
When did you give it away?  
What did the old man say?  
And how many babies did you kick today?  
Now, how many nights can the full moon shine?  
How many bottles of water can you turn to wine  
When the blood has flowed against the tides of time  
And the water flows forever? Hey, hey, hey  
Now, I'm gonna build a boat, I'm gonna make it float  
'Cause I'm getting the chase for a faraway place  
Gonna set the sail, gonna catch some wind  
And the big red sky's gonna be my only friend  
With a boat for two, just me and you  
You can be my teacher, I can teach you too  
Gonna try a few things that I've never done  
Maybe talk to the fishes, maybe have some fun  
Maybe shake my pale fist at the angry stars  
While I dance a jig under the eyes of Mars  
When we get to an island where no one's ever been  
We can get down and dirty in our animal skins  
And I stand with my thing hanging out in the wind  
Where the water's sweet like honey  
Hey, hey, yeah, hey, hey, yeah, yeah, hey, now  
I've been feeling a chill, from the East wind blue  
Is it creeping up slow, have you felt it too?  
Have you noticed the look, have you felt the feel?  
Did it make you blush when the piggy squealed?  
Have you heard what they say, did you read the news?  
Said, the old man's coming home a singing the blues  
Gonna whack your fanny, gonna tan your hide  
Make your ears turn red and make you gonna cry  
Now, well, how many children gonna lose their minds  
How many crying girls will be left behind?  
When the dead start walking and the full moon shines  
When the dead start walking and the full moon shines  
When the dead start walking and the full moon shines  
When the dead start walking and the full moon shines  
When the dead start walking, yeah  
Now, everybody sing to the heavens above  
And everybody dance to the sounds of love  
Won't you clack your teeth, won't you smack your hands?  
Won't you dig your little heads right out of the sand?  
Won't you jiggle your butt, won't you wave your arms?  
Won't you look like you just came off of the farm?  
Won't you stop your fighting for a second or two?  
Won't you help your neighbors, won't you do the do?  
Won't you taste the sugar, won't you eat the cake?  
Won't you get your ugly mug right out of my face?  
Won't you tell your brothers and your sisters tonight  
That you tasted the water and the water was right?  
Won't you taste the sugar, won't you dance the dance?  
Won't you wake up? Please and come on out of your trance  
Everybody make believe that you disappear  
For a second or two, gonna feel so queer  
And you left behind all your rage and fear  
And it made you feel like water  

We close our eyes  
We close our eyes and dream and the world has turned around again  
  
When everybody is running in the big race  
And having a good time  
Who am I to cast a shadow  
Who am I?  
I looked Death in the face last night  
I saw him in a mirror  
And he simply smiled  
He told me not to worry  
He told me just to take my time  
  
Chorus:  
We close our eyes and the world has turned around again  
We close our eyes and dream and another year has come and gone  
We close our eyes and the world has turned around again  
We close our eyes and dream ...  
  
And if you come to me  
And if you touch my hand  
I might just slip away  
I might just disappear  
Who am I?  
And if you think I'm worth it  
And if you think it's not too late  
We might start falling  
If we don't try to hard  
We might start falling in love  
  
(Chorus)  
  
We're on the healing path  
We're on a roller coaster ride  
That could never turn back  
And if you love me  
And if you really try  
To make the seconds count  
Then we can close our eyes  
  
(chorus)  
  
We close our eyes and the world has turned around again

What you see is what you get  
Don't relax you're not home yet  
What you see is what you get  
Don't relax you're not home yet  
Put your life into my hands  
Look around you'll understand  
Put your life into my hands  
It's the '80's idiot  
What you see is what you get  
It's the '80's little fool  
Don't forget the golden rule  
What you see is what you get  
What the hell did you expect  
Pretty red roses, wet puppy noses  
Men with rubber hoses is more like it  
What you see is not always what you get  
A lesson we must not forget  
One never knows what to expect  
So close your eyes and what you get  
Is what you see and what you get  
Open up your eyes and look around  
Then close them tight and kiss the ground  
You better be thankful you're alive  
And how much longer can you survive  
Underneath the mask there's something brewing  
Underneath the ground there's something moving  
It's the '80's idiot  
What you see is what you get  
It's the '80's little fool  
Don't forget the golden rule  
What you see is what you get  
What the hell did you expect  
Pretty red roses, wet puppy noses  
Men with rubber hoses is more like it  
Patrolling the street with all of their friends  
Bashing you around trying to make you like them  
What you see is what you get  
  

Who do you want to be today?  
Who do you want to be?  
Who do you want to be today?  
Do you want to be just like someone on TV?  
Oh boredom is so terrible, it's like a dread disease  
Nothing could be worse than when there's nothing on TV  
I'd rather be a cowboy than to stare blank at the walls  
I've been reborn so many times, I can't remember them all  
Who do you want to be today?  
Who do you want to be?  
Who do you want to be today?  
Do you want to be just like someone on TV?  
Just like someone on TV  
I think I'll be a teddy boy, I think I'll be a hunk  
I think I'll be a tough guy and I think I'll be a punk  
I might just be a fashion star all dressed in frilly rags  
Or perhaps, I'll cross the other side and walk around in drag!  
Who do you want to be today?  
Who do you want to be?  
Who do you want to be today?  
Do you want to be just like someone on TV?  
Just like somebody on TV  
Do you like to be just like a rock  
In the middle of the sea  
Do you want to suffer by yourself  
In a pool of blissful misery  
Do you want to feel like a saint in artists' clothes  
With a rosary in your hand  
Do you wanna be crazy like Van Gogh  
Like a stranger in a strange, strange land  
Would you rather push the buttons  
And be feared by all humanity  
Or perhaps you'd like to be a bum  
Do you wanna be stupid, just like me  
Who do you want to be today?  
Who do you want to be?  
Who do you want to be today?  
Do you want to be just like someone on TV?  
Just like somebody on TV  
Who do you want to be today?  
Who do you want to be today?  
Who do you want to be today?  
Who do you want to be today?  
Who do you want to be today?  
Who do you want to be?  
Who do you want to be today?  
Who do you want to be?  

Have you seen my girlfriend  
She lives in a pig pen  
Have you seen my girlfriend  
I can't seem to find her  
Perhaps she is hiding  
Underneath a blade of grass  
CHORUS  
Let's take the whole day off  
Let's take the whole day off  
Let's take the whole day off . . .  
Have you seen my new house  
Looks just like a dog house  
Have you seen my new house  
Someone saw it walking  
Straight into the ocean  
He thought it was an ivory boat  
CHORUS  
BRIDGE  
Maybe--it's just a bad dream and I'll wake up soon  
But I don't think I'll be so lucky  
Maybe--it's just one of those strange days when nothing seems right  
No nothing seems right at all  
Went up to a pay phone on a bathroom wall  
But I can't remember who I want to call  
Operator can you help me  
Have you seen my garden  
It is most peculiar  
Have you seen my garden  
Nothing there that grows  
Looks anything at all like plants  
I hear their voices . . .  
Let's take the whole day off . . .  
CHORUS  
Have you seen my girlfriend  
Have you seen my girlfriend . . .  
  

They gave you such a hard time  
When they took your babe away  
You heard it on the airwaves  
That she joined the sla  
Oh the stories, tape recordings  
Just when things seemed at their worst  
Then the good Lord heard you calling  
And he gave back Patty Hearst  
  
You got your baby back  
Poor girl is out of the sack  
Silly young thing, was just a fling  
Like any teenager would do  
But daddy is here now, to buy you some clothes  
And maybe a new cadilliac  
You got your baby back  
  
When she started to flee, you gave food for free  
But you knew that you would'nt go broke  
The day in the bank, the sporting, the prank [?]  
Was just a fraternity joke  
  
You got your babe, that's no lie  
Thanks to the old fbi  
Time to relate and sit by a pool  
And maybe she'll go back to school  
  
And Daddy is here now, to buy you some clothes  
Amd maybe a new cadilliac  
You got your baby back  
  
(spoken)  
Why Patty baby  
I knew deep down in my heart that you'd be coming back to your papa  
And honey, I did'nt believe a thing they said in all those silly little old  
Newspapers,  
Especially the ones I didn't own.  
But don't worry darling, We'll be keeping your supper warm  
  
When she started to flee, you gave food for free  
But you knew that you wouldn't go broke  
The day in the bank, the sporting, the prank  
Was just a fraternity joke.  
  
You got your baby back, poor girl is out of the sack  
Silly young thing, was just a fling like any teenager would do  
But daddy is here now, to buy you some clothes and maybe a new cadilliac  
You got your baby back (repeat three times)

Girl, you really got me now  
You got me so I don't know what I'm doin'  
Girl, you really got me now  
You got me so I can't sleep at night  
  
[Chorus]  
Girl, you really got me now  
You got me so I don't know where I'm goin', yeah  
Oh Girl, you really got me now  
You got me so I can't sleep at night  
  
You really got me  
You really got me  
You really got me  
  
Please, don't ever let me be  
I only want to be by your side  
Please, don't ever let me be  
I only want to be by your side  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You really got me  
You really got me  
You really got me  
Oh no, no, ah  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
You really got me  
You really got me  
You really got me  
Oh Oh Oh
