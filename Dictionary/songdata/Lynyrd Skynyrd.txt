I heard the voice and saw the face  
And I know he was there  
The robe it floated around my bed  
And I felt no pain  
  
You can talk about the help you need  
He's a friend indeed  
Just open your heart and live again  
And he'll set you free  
  
Well, he took them away  
All the troubles and the pain  
Whoa, you can call me a fool  
But I know he was there  
Yes, I know he was there  
  
The night I had, has long since gone  
But the memories stay  
And now Mr. Trouble when you come my way  
I'm not too proud to pray  
  
Yes, he took them away  
All the troubles and the pain  
Whoa, you can call me a fool  
But I know he was there  
Yes, I know he was there  
  
Well, he took them away  
All the troubles and the pain  
Whoa, you can call me a fool  
But I know he was there  
Yes, I know he was there  
  
The night I had, has long since gone  
But the memories stay  
And now Mr. Trouble when you come my way  
I'm not too proud to pray

Tornados spinnin', I sit here grinnin'  
I think we've all seen this movie before  
This is confusin', almost amusin'  
It's hard to tell up and down anymore  
When did it get so crazy, how did we lose control  
Everybody's shouting, how bad it really sucks  
  
Situation normal  
All funked up, We're all funked up  
  
We had some leaders, and they were cheaters  
But they came out smelling like a rose  
We should reject them, but we respect them  
For what they do when the door is closed  
Nothing in this world a simple man can do  
Stand up and be counted, ain't you had enough  
  
Situation normal  
All funked up, Yeah we're all funked up  
We're functionally dysfunctional  
We're functionally yeah dysfunctional  
We're all funked up  
  
Don't you know the meaning of the word snafu  
Better known as trouble for me and you  
Murphy's law will get ya, he's on his way  
Same ole same ole shit a different day  
  
Tornado's spinnin', I sit here grinnin'  
I think we've all seen this movie before  
This is confusin', almost amusin'  
It's hard to tell up and down anymore  
Everybody's shouting, how bad it really sucks  
  
Situation normal  
All funked up, we're all funked up  
We're all funked up  
We're all funked up  
  
Oh  
All funked up

Well this life that I've lead has took me everywhere  
There ain't no place I ain't never gone  
But it's kind of like the saying that you heard so many times  
Well there just ain't no place like home  
Did you ever see a she-gator protect her young  
Or a fish in a river swimming free  
Did you ever see the beauty of the hills of Carolina  
Or the sweetness of the grass in Tennessee  
And lord I can't make any changes  
All I can do is write 'em in a song  
I can see the concrete slowly creepin'  
Lord take me and mine before that comes  
  
Do you like to see a mountain stream a-flowin'  
Do you like to see a young gun with his dog  
Did you ever stop to think about, well, the air your breathin'  
Well you better listen to my song  
And lord I can't make any changes  
All I can do is write 'em in a song  
I can see the concrete slowly creepin'  
Lord take me and mine before that comes  
  
I'm not tryin' to put down no big cities  
But the things they write about us is just a bore  
Well you can take a boy out of ol' dixieland  
But you'll never take ol' Dixie from a boy  
And lord I can't make any changes  
All I can do is write 'em in a song  
I can see the concrete slowly creepin'  
Lord take me and mine before that comes  
'Cause I can see the concrete slowly creepin'  
Lord take me and mine before that comes

I recall when I used to come home never had a dime  
But Lord I always had a good time  
And I recall drinkin' wine with one of my friends  
Lord, I can't go back again  
  
[Chorus)]  
Am I losin' my own way back home  
Am I losin' a good friend that I've known  
Am I losin' won't you tell me how I've sinned  
Why am I losin one of my bets friends  
  
And I recall this friend of mine I knew so well  
It goes to show Lord you just can't tell  
Now my friend won't talk to me Let me tell you why  
He thinks I 've changed because of a dollar sign  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And its so strange when you get just a little money  
Your so called friends want to act just a little funny  
They'll blame you  
  
But I'm not the one that's here to blame  
Its you my friend that's really changed  
Its a shame, such a shame  
Am I losin' once again  
  
Why these things happen, Lord I don't understand  
But Lord it can sure hurt a man  
Why my friend won't take me as I am  
'Cause your friend Lord is the most important thing  
  
[Chorus]

I snuck around the corner he had this guy down  
I through the first punch that's when he hit the ground  
To survive in the street you gotta win the first round  
'cause if you want eat you gotta be the baddest one around  
I'm a backstreet crawler  
  
Daddy paid for college I earned a degree  
Got a job up on Wall Street  
Where I learned to make the little man bleed  
That's when I got stomped like a cattle stampede  
Had a nervous breakdown all my friends and family left me  
  
Yeah I'm a backstreet crawler  
When you see them on the concrete it's their spirit that's harder  
Yeah I'm a backstreet crawler  
Where your ego meets defeat and your pride can't get no smaller  
Yeah I'm a backstreet crawler  
Yeah I'm a backstreet crawler  
  
I guess you might say it sure is a shame  
I used to have everything oh how my life has changed  
Yeah I'm broken and torn I've never been free  
Lost everything that meant a thing to me  
  
Yeah I'm a backstreet crawler  
When you see them on the concrete it's their spirit that's harder  
Yeah I'm a backstreet crawler  
Where your ego meets defeat and your pride can't get no smaller  
Yeah I'm a backstreet crawler  
Yeah I'm a backstreet crawler

I can still remember I was eight years old  
The first time that I picked her up little did I know  
She's taken me to places that I've never been  
Did my first gig in a rock-n-roll band  
Berneice, sweet Berneice  
  
Get a real job let the guitar go  
There ain't no future in this rock-n-roll  
So go for your guitars, go for your guns  
Better think twice it's three against one  
Take your best shot it's a showdown now  
Berneice, sweet Berneice  
Oh, Berneice won't you play for me  
  
A guitar woman needs a guitar man  
One without the other, neither one of them can stand  
Remember where we came from we can do it all again  
So thanks to all you people, give youselves a hand  
Berneice, sweet Berneice  
Berneice, won't you play for me

Here I sit all by myself  
Wonderin' how she could put our love on a shelf  
A crowd of people, they pass me by  
But all I can do is hang my head and cry  
  
[Chorus]  
Blame it on a sad song in the night  
I don't want anyone but you to make it right  
Blame it on a sad song in the night  
Well, it's an old familiar feelin'  
Girl, it's got my heart reelin'  
Don't want to hear a sad song in the night  
Anymore  
  
I know when we first started out  
I was your only love and you had no doubt  
But songs of the heart don't last forever  
But don't you give up on love 'cause you never say never  
  
[Chorus]  
  
'Cause not a day goes by that I don't think about you  
Oh, moment to moment, I get lost in time  
And many years from now when I hear that song come on the radio  
All those feelings will come back to haunt me  
My heart will let me know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Blame it on a sad song  
You can blame it on a sad song, baby  
Blame it on, blame it on a sad song

There's an old man sittin' on a front porch now  
Talkin' 'bout how it used to be  
When I was young I was a hell of a man  
My father died when I was ten  
I hit the road to find a job  
Had to feed my family  
Times were hard my hands are still scarred  
From the life I've had to lead  
I was born to run  
  
Drove a tractor and trailer all my life  
Six kids and a hell of a wife  
Made lots of money it all slipped away  
A large family that's the price you pay  
I always dreamed never gave up  
Son, even when times got tough  
That's when I'd push it a little bit more  
You should've heard that engine roar  
  
[Chorus]  
I was born to run  
Can't slow down  
No regrets, I've been blessed  
Born to run  
In time you'll see what the good lord's done for me  
Born to run  
I can't slow down  
No regrets, I did my best  
Born to run  
In time you'll see  
What the good lord's done, done for me  
  
The old man, he passed away  
And all he said never crossed my mind  
Until I saw the price he paid  
Was a lot like mine  
I'm full and though it's miles away  
Gotta hit the city right on time  
And when I'm on I'll always sing little song of mine  
I was born to run  
  
[Chorus]

Call me the breeze  
I keep blowin' down the road  
Well now, they call me the breeze  
I keep blowin' down the road  
I ain't got me nobody  
I don't carry me no load  
Ain't no change in the weather  
Ain't no changes in me  
Well, there ain't no change in the weather  
Ain't no changes in me  
And I ain't hidin' from nobody  
Nobody's hidin' from me

Ooh, Mr. Breeze

Cheatin' woman make you crazy  
Cheatin' woman make you a fool  
She'll leave your heart so lonely  
Brother there's nothin' you can do  
  
Well I can't stand the pain no more  
She don't want my love for sure  
She don't even want poor me  
Knockin' on her front door  
  
Why did you make me love you sister  
When you knew you was untrue  
You loved every man with pants on  
Yes a dozen to you is too few  
I'm gonna shoot you and end your world  
Then you won't bother poor me  
You won't bother poor me no longer  
  
Cheatin' woman -- gonna shoot ya  
Oh woman why you do me  
Oh Lord the way you do  
I done everything I can baby  
Seems like nothin' reaches you  
  
I'm gonna get that pistol gal  
I'm gonna shoot you and all your pals  
You ain't gonna bother poor me  
You won't bother poor me no longer

It's been so long since I've been gone  
Another day might be too long for me  
Traveling around I've had my fill  
Of broken dreams and dirty deals  
A concrete jungle surrounding me  
Many nights I've slept out in the streets  
I paid my dues and I changed my style  
Seen hard times, all over now  
  
I want to come home. It's been so long since I've been away  
And please, don't blame me 'cause I've tried  
I'll be coming home soon to your love, to stay  
  
I miss old friends that I once had  
Times ain't changed and I'll be glad when I go home  
I don't know why the thought came to me  
But why I'm here I really can't see, and now  
  
I want to come home. It's been so long since I've been away  
And please, don't blame me 'cause I've tried  
I'll be coming home soon to your love, to stay  
Coming home to stay  
Coming home to your love, mama  
I've seen better days  
  
I miss old friends that I once had  
Times ain't changed and I'll be glad when I go home  
I don't know why the thought came to me  
But why I'm here I really can't see, and now  
  
I want to come home. it's been so long since I've been away  
And please, don't blame me 'cause I've tried  
I'll be coming home soon to your love, to stay  
Coming home to stay  
Coming home to your love, mama  
I've seen better days

(Robert Johnson)  
  
I went down to the crosroads  
Fell down on my knees  
Down to the crossroads  
Fell down on my knees  
I said I'm beggin' for mercy won't you take me  
If you please  
  
I went down to the crossroads  
Tried to beg a ride  
I went down to the crossroads  
Tried to beg a ride  
Nobody seemed to know me  
Everybody passed me by  
Take a ride  
  
Going down toward Rosedale  
Took Loretta by my side  
Going down to Rosedale  
Took Loretta by my side  
Can still buy a house there  
On the riverside  
One more time  
  
You can run, you can run  
Tell all my friends I'll be by  
You can run, you can run  
Tell my friends I'll be by  
And I'll be stayin' in the crossroads  
I believe I'm sinkin' down

Well, there's a devil in the bottle, staring straight at me  
Daring me to reach out, but I know he's testing me  
If I take just one sip, I become that devil's son  
Act a fool, sell my soul before God and everyone  
Oh Lord, I know, I only hurt the ones I love  
  
I'm walkin' down this dead end road, all alone and by myself  
Wish I could blame the whiskey, but I can only blame myself  
Running out of chances, and Lord that's such a crime  
I got to find the answer before I lose my mind  
Oh Lord its a cryin' shame, oh Lord I've caused so much pain  
I only hurt the ones I love  
  
There's a devil in a bottle that just won't let me be  
So many times I've been hurtin' my soul and family  
But I got free on the day I fought the  
Devil in the bottle  
  
The next time that ol' devil tries to get the best of me  
I'll smash that bottle against the wall and know I'm finally free  
There's a devil in a bottle that just won't let me be  
There's so many times I let him hurt me  
I got free the day I fought the  
  
Devil in the bottle  
Devil in the bottle  
Devil in the bottle

Yeah, she's sittin' at the table, lookin' down at her drink  
She's always on time, I'm always runnin' late

Come on over brother, she'll understand  
Meet me at the chug, we got some plannin' to do

Eleven times I been busted, eleven times I been to jail  
Some of the times I been there nobody could go my bail  
Well it seems to me, lord that this ol' boy just don't fit  
Well I can jump in a rosebush and come out smelling like sh...  
  
Those misters dressed in blue never done so right by me  
Some of the times I was innocent but the judge said guilty  
I'm not one to complain now son I tell you true  
When the black cat cross your trail, lord  
It comes in misery times two  
  
[Chorus:]  
Double trouble--that's what my friends all call me  
(double trouble)  
I said, double trouble  
T-r-o-u-b-l-e  
  
Well I was born down in the gutter  
With a temper as hot as fire  
Spent ninety days on a peat farm just doin' the county's time  
Well now, even mama said son you're bad news  
And it won't be too long before someone puts one through you

Well Billy Joe told me, said everything's lookin' fine  
He's got the place all secured, got the icebox full of wine  
He said hurry on over and don't be late  
He got three lovely ladies who just won't wait  
Do some down south jukin'  
And lookin' for a peace of mind  
Now put your Sunday pants on, lets get out on on the road  
We been workin' all week, and thinkin' its time we let go  
I got three fine mamas sittin all alone, gonna sip my wine and get it on  
And do some down south jukin'  
Lookin' for a peace of mind  
Now come Monday morn we'll be headin' out to the field  
And we'll be doin our thing for Papa and ol' Uncle Bill  
Lord, but then come Friday night we'll be headin' to town  
Tryin' to pick up any woman hanging around  
And do some down south jukin'  
Lookin' for a peace of mind

Well I've been ridin' a winning horse for a long, long time  
Sometimes I wonder is this the end of the line  
No one should take advantage of who they are  
No man has got it made  
If he thinks he does, he's wrong  
  
[Chorus:]  
Every mother's son better hear what I say  
Every mother's son will rise and fall someday  
  
I've seen it happen so many times, so many times before  
Some man got so much money he doesn't worry no more  
Or he's got such a pretty woman that'll treat him fine  
Well my friend has been a fool  
It happens every time  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm not tryin' to preach to no one, to no one at all  
I've seen so many of my good friends just rise to fall  
'Cause they got so much money or a woman so fine  
Well my friends have all been fools, it happens every time  
  
[Chorus]  
  
What I say  
  
[Chorus]  
  
What I say  
Oh, every mother's son will rise and fall someday

Well them four walls of Raiford, closing in on me  
Doin' three to five hard labor, for armed robbery  
I had two years behind me, but I could not wait the time  
Everytime I thought about it, well I died some more inside  
  
And I had stripes on my back, memories that hurt  
For the only time I seen sunshine is when I hit the dirt  
Diggin' ditches for the chain gang, sleepin' in the cold  
Oh Lord please forgive me for I could not wait no more  
  
[Chorus]  
And I'm comin' home to see you Jesus  
Well it feels so close this time  
Please take mercy on this soldier  
From the Florida-Georgia line  
  
When they find me they must kill me  
Oh Jesus save my soul  
I can't go back down to Raiford  
I can't take that anymore  
  
Well these last few years behind me  
Oh Lord, have been so sad  
I fought proudly for my country when the times were bad  
Now they say I'm guilty, when they find me I must die  
Only me and Jesus know that I never stole a dime  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well when Vietnam was over there was no work here for me  
I had a pretty wife awaitin and two kids I had to feed  
Well I'm one of America's heroes and when they shoot me down  
Won't you fly old Glory proudly, put my medals in the ground  
  
And I'm comin' home to see you Jesus  
Well it feels so close this time  
Please take mercy on this soldier  
From the Florida-Georgia line  
  
When they find me they must kill me  
Oh Jesus save my soul  
I can't go back down to Raiford  
I can't take that anymore

Well, you can see her walkin' down on Peachtree Street  
She got high-heeled shoes and a dot on her cheek  
She's lookin' good, she's headed downtown  
Ain't got no money, honey  
She knows her way around  
I think she's cute, think she's cute as she can be  
Talkin' about a funny talkin', honk-tonking Georgia Peach  
  
Well these Georgia Peaches  
Son they know their way around  
They can take your money, son before you get sight of town  
Well they talk a little funny, but they look so fine  
Nine out of ten of them gonna sell you a dime  
I think they're cute, think they're cute as they can be  
Talkin' about a funny talkin', honk-tonking Georgia Peach  
  
Well, peaches, peaches

Well they talk a little funny, but they look so fine

Talkin' about a funny talkin', honk-tonking Georgia Peach  
Talkin' about a funny talkin', honk-tonking Georgia Peach  
  
I just seem to fall in love with the wrong things

Life is so strange when its changin', yes indeed  
Well I've seen the hard times and the pressure's been on me  
But I keep on workin' like the workin' man do  
And I've got my act together, gonna walk all over you  
  
[Chorus]  
Gimme back my bullets  
Put 'em back where they belong  
Ain't foolin' around 'cause I done had my fun  
Ain't gonna see no more damage done  
Gimme back my bullets  
  
Sweet talkin' people done ran me out of town  
And I drank enough whiskey to float a battleship around  
But I'm leavin' this game one step ahead of you  
And you will not hear me cry 'cause I do not sing the blues  
  
[Chorus]  
Gimme back, gimme back my bullets  
Oh, put 'em back...where they belong  
  
Been up and down since I turned seventeen  
Well I've been on top, and then it seems I lost my dream  
But I got it back, I'm feelin' better everyday  
Tell all those pencil pushers, better get out of my way  
  
[Chorus]  
Gimme back, gimme back my bullets  
Oh put 'em back where they belong  
Gimme back my bullets

Last night I heard this politician  
Talking bout his brand new mission  
Liked his plans but they came undone  
When he got around to God and guns  
  
I don't know how he grew up  
But it sure wasn't down at the hunting club  
Cause if it was he'd understand  
Just a little bit more about the working man  
  
God and guns  
Keep us strong  
That's what this country  
Was founded on  
  
Well we might as well  
Give up and run  
If we let them take our  
God and guns  
  
Yeah out here in my neck of the woods  
Where God is great and guns are  
Good  
You really can't know that much about them  
If you think we'd be better off without them  
  
Oh there was we aint forgot  
You could rest all night with your doors unlocked  
But there aint nobody safe no more  
So you say your prayers and you thank the Lord  
  
For that peacemaker  
In your dresser drawer  
  
God and guns  
Keep us strong  
That's what this country Lord  
Was founded on  
  
Well we might as well  
Give up and run  
If we let them take our  
God and guns  
  
Yeah we might as well  
Give up and run  
If we let them take our  
God and guns  
  
Yeah  
Oh  
God and guns  
  
Don't let em take  
Don't you let em take  
Don't let em take  
Our God and guns  
  
Oh God and guns  
Yeah keep us strong  
That's what this country Lord  
Was founded on  
  
Well we might as well  
Give up and run  
If we let them take our  
God and guns  
  
God and guns

The only time I'll get up early  
Is to meet my mules at the fishin' hole  
I want to catch the one that got away  
I want to feel my pole bending in that way  
Since I was a kid I've felt this way  
I fell, hook, line and sinker.  
  
Gone Fishin' Yeah  
  
St John's River runs north not south  
Smart enough to have a large mouth  
If you can hook 'em, you can mount 'em, you can keep 'em around  
But if they break your line they're gonna go back down  
  
Since I was a kid I've felt this way  
I fell, hook, line and sinker.  
  
Gone Fishin' Oh  
  
Ain't nothing like sunrise on a lake  
But when the moon comes up at night  
There's things out there that can take your life  
You might just die of fright  
  
But I'll be there come rain or shine  
You see it's what I like to do  
Only thing better than settin' a hook  
is settin' my hook in you.  
  
I fell, hook, line and sinker.  
Gone Fishin' Oh Oh Yeah, Yeah, Wooo Yeah  
  
I been everywhere, tried everything  
But there ain't nothing that feels the same  
When you find the right one it's a magical thing  
Next thing you know it's a diamond ring  
  
She hooked me and took my name  
I fell, hook, line and sinker.  
  
Gone Fishin' Yeah  
Gone, Gone Fishin'  
She Hooked Me  
  
Gone, Gone Fishin' Yeah  
Gone, Gone, Gone Fishin' Yeah  
  
She's my baby  
Well I'm gone  
  
Gone Fishin' Yeah Yeah Oh Oh  
Gone Fishin'

My baby came home late last night  
I said girl I gotta talk to you  
I've been drinkin' with the man next door  
He said he's been singin' with you  
Whoever's tellin' lies it's time to say bye-bye  
You know my mama didn't raise no fool  
  
[Chorus]  
You're gonna walk out that door you'll never see me anymore  
Tell you what I'm gonna do  
I'm gonna love ya' just one more time  
I'd love to see what you've got  
I don't care if it takes all night  
Gonna make you remember for the rest of your life oh baby  
  
We had a good thing a good thing goin'  
But ain't been seein' eye to eye  
You had a good thing but it's all over  
Might as well wave and say goodbye  
  
It's easy to see the guilt in your eyes  
Girl I want you to tell me the truth  
Was he worth the risk and all the trouble he's caused  
Now it comes down to me and you  
You thought I was blind when you were gone all the time  
Playin' me for a fool  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We had a good thing goin' baby but it's all over  
  
Good thing, good thing goin'

I don't care who you are baby  
Don't care about all the friends that you know  
And why you chose me  
Lord, sweet mama don't want to know  
Can't tie me down baby  
Don't bring me down  
Chains can't hold me, I gotta go  
  
I don't want your money baby  
Don't care for your fancy clothes  
And how you people live together  
I say lord in heaven only knows  
  
Can't tie me down people  
Don't bring me down  
Oh the man can't stop me, I gotta go  
Gonna hit that road  
Buy me some coke  
  
You can take all your charm baby  
Yea sweet daddy knows where it goes  
Yes it does  
You can tell your big sister thanks a lot for the hole  
  
Can't tie me down baby  
Don't bring me down  
Chains can't hold me, I gotta go  
Gonna hit that road  
I gotta go, don't hold me baby

Alas my love you do me wrong  
To cast me out discourteously  
When I have loved you so so long  
Delighting in your company  
  
Your gown was of the grassy green  
Your sleeves of satin were hanging by  
Which made you be a harvest queen  
Yet you would not love me  
  
Green sleeves was my all my joy  
Green sleeves was my delight  
Green sleeves was my heart of gold  
And who but my lady green sleeves  
  
Alas my love you do me wrong  
To cast me out discourteously  
When I have loved you so so long  
Delighting in your company

Since my baby left me, i found a new place to dwell  
Down at the end of lonely street at heartbreak hotel  
I get so lonely baby  
I get so lonely, i get so lonely i could die  
  
Though the place is crowded, you still can find some room  
Where those broken hearted lovers cry away their blues  
I get so lonely baby  
I get so lonely, i get so lonely i could die  
I get so lonely  
I get so lonely, i get so lonely i could die  
I get so lonely  
I get so lonely, i get so lonely

Mama used to say to me, you can make your destiny  
Keep your feet planted on the ground  
You can always get it back, make a castle from a one room shack  
It's all of what you make of what you've found  
Son you're gonna find out when you're older  
There's always been the hand of God restin' right there on your shoulder  
Will it be Hell or Heaven on earth the choice is up to you  
Look to the sky, the answer is clear  
Are you gonna, live life for all it's worth  
Choose Hell, or Heaven on earth  
If you live it right, there's nothing to fear  
'Cause you'll find Heaven right here  
Saw a man the other day, had it made in every way  
Till his greed brought him down  
He was blinded by the city lights, now he shivers in the cold tonight  
Who will save the lifeguard when he's about to drown  
Will it be Hell or Heaven on earth the choice is up to you  
Look to the sky, the answer is clear  
Are you gonna, live life for all it's worth  
Choose Hell, or Heaven on earth  
If you live it right, there's nothing to fear  
'Cause you'll find Heaven right here  
You know you're gonna walk through fire  
You know your gonna feel the pain  
You're gonna lose, if you want to win the game  
And every time your heart is breakin'  
And every time your faith is shaken  
Remember what mama said that day  
Hope when my time has come  
I've left enough to build upon  
Ain't no one gonna say, "I didn't try"  
Here's why  
Hell or Heaven on earth the choice is up to you  
Look to the sky, the answer is clear  
Are you gonna, live life for all it's worth  
Choose Hell, or Heaven on earth  
If you live it right, there's nothing to fear  
'Cause you'll find Heaven right here  
You'll find Heaven right here  
You'll find Heaven right here, Heaven right here  

Oh yeah, alright  
I do believe in you more than myself  
I can depend on you when I need help  
So when I tell you, please understand, yeah  
That I do love you, love you man to man  
Oh yeah, alright  
I remember, oh, so well when the times were bad  
If I needed anything you'd give me all you had  
And when the troubles came you were by my side, yeah  
You said, "Use God as your guide, my son  
Don't you know he's alive, he's alive, oh yeah"  
But now you have gone and I'm on my own  
But I realize one thing, one man is never alone  
But I wish that you were here right by my side, yeah  
I would love to tell you that I know he's alive  
He's alive, oh yeah, alright

(gary rossington - ed king - johnny van zant - mike estes)  
  
Getting work ain't easy in the hills of tennessee  
But things are bad all over my friends keep telling me  
Even though I grew up there and never thought I'd leave  
Had too many bills to pay, seven mouths to feed  
Movin' to the city was all that I could do  
Got them hillbilly blues  
  
People here won't say goodmorning, they won't even take the time  
I guess I know just how it feels to have something on your mind  
So all I want is to go back home and fish in a mountain stream  
This ol' life I'm living lord, you know it ain't for me  
They say the sun it shines out here, but all I see is rain  
Got them hillbilly blues  
Got them hillbilly blues  
  
All I want is to go back home and fish in a mountain stream  
This ol' life I'm living lord, you know it ain't for me  
They say the sun it shines out here, but all I see is rain  
Got them hillbilly blues  
Hillbilly blues  
Hillbilly blues

There's a little place down in Jackson County  
Right off the river road  
If you wanna take a ride to the end of the rainbow  
Find yourself a pot of gold  
Everybody asks me where I'm goin'  
Yeah everybody wants to know  
Your sister says she wants to come along with me  
I know she really wants to go  
Yeah I know she really wants to go  
  
Down, down, down, down  
Down is where I wanna go  
Down, down, down, down  
Down to the honey hole  
  
If you wanna check it out on a hot summer night  
Climb over the garden wall  
Grab your little baby and hold her tight  
Underneath the sugar falls  
Underneath the sugar falls  
  
Down, down, down, down  
Down is where I wanna go  
Down, down, down, down  
To the honey hole  
To the honey hole!  
  
Sugarcane grows wild in the fields  
Like corn sticky yellow sweet  
Late at night you can hear 'em all buzzin'  
Searchin' for the queen bee  
Callin' for the queen bee  
  
Down, down, down, down  
Down is where I wanna go  
Down, down, down, down  
To the honey hole  
To the honey hole!  
To the honey hole  
To the honey hole  
To the honey hole

Little bit of Bakersfield  
I'm a honky tonk night time man  
I can't stand no light  
I'm a honky tonk night time man  
I can't stand no light  
I get my rest in the day time  
Do my runnin' around at night  
  
I had the blues this morning  
Had the blues all day today  
I had the blues this morning  
Had the blues all day today  
Well I wish a tornado  
Come and blow my blues away, away  
That's what I said, take 'em away  
  
Sounds like Roy  
Yeah  
  
And then my heart starts beatin'  
When that sun starts sinkin' low  
Well my heart starts beatin'  
When that sun starts sinkin' low  
When the shadows fall  
I know its time for me to go  
  
Billy Powell on piano  
Oh Barry, play me some dobro  
I'm a honky tonk night time man  
I can't stand no light  
I'm a honky tonk night time man  
I can't stand no light  
I get my rest in the day time  
I do my runnin' around, round at night  
I get my rest in the day time  
Gets that old love sweet stuff at night

Now I'll tell you plainly, baby, what a plan to do.  
Say, I may be crazy, woman, but I ain't no fool.  
Your daddy's rich, mama, and you're overdue  
But I ain't the one, baby, been messin' with you.  
Got bells in your mind, lady, and it's easy to see.  
I think it's time for me to move along, I do believe.  
  
Or are you tryin' to put a hook on me? oh no...  
  
Now you're talkin' jive, woman, when you say to me  
That your daddy's gonna take us in, baby, 'n take care of me.  
You know and I know, woman, I ain't the one.  
I never hurt you, sweetheart, said, I never pulled my gun.  
Got bells in your mind, mama, and it's easy to see.  
I think it's time for me to move along, I do believe.  
  
Time for me to put my boots out in the streets.  
Are you ready?  
Walk on!  
  
Alright little missy, let me tell you a thing or two...  
  
Now you're talkin' jive, woman, when you say to me  
That your daddy's gonna take us in, baby, 'n take care of me.  
You know and I know, woman, I ain't the one.  
I never hurt you, sweetheart, said, I never pulled my gun.  
Got bells in your mind, mama, and it's easy to see.  
I think it's time for me to move along, I do believe.  
  
Oh, I must be in the middle of some kinda conspiracy...

Yes sir  
  
Well the bigger the city, well the brighter the lights  
The bigger the dog, well the harder the bite  
I don't know where you been last night  
But I think mama, you ain't doin' right  
  
[Chorus]  
Say I know a little  
I know a little about it  
I know a little  
I know a little 'bout it  
I know a little 'bout love  
And baby I can guess the rest  
  
Well now I don't read that daily news  
'Cause it ain't hard to figure  
Where people get the blues  
They can't dig what they can't use  
If they stick to themselves  
They'd be much less abused  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Play me a little, oh yeah  
Yeah  
  
Well if you want me to be your only man  
Said listen up mama, teach you all I can  
Do right baby, by your man  
Don't worry mama, teach you all I can  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well I know a little 'bout love  
Baby I want your best

Ain't no need to worry  
There ain't no use to cry  
'Cause I'll be comin' home soon  
To keep you satisfied  
You know I get so lonely  
That I feel I can't go on  
And it feels so good inside, babe  
Just to call you on the telephone, I said  
  
Ooh baby, I love you  
What more can I say?  
Ooh baby, I need you  
I miss you more every day  
  
I woke up early this mornin'  
And the sun came shining down  
And it found me wishin' and hopin'  
Mama you could be around  
For you know I need you  
More than the air I breathe  
And I guess I'm just tryin' to tell you, woman  
Oh, what you mean to me, yeah yeah  
  
Ooh baby, I love you  
What more can I say?  
Ooh baby, I need you  
I miss you more every day  
  
I'm tryin' to tell you I love you  
In each and every way  
I'm tryin' to tell you I need you  
Much more than a piece of lay  
  
Ooh baby, I love you  
What more can I say?  
Ooh baby, I need you  
I miss you more every day  
  
Ooh baby I love you  
What more can I say  
Oh baby I need your sweet lovin'  
I miss you more, more every day  
  
Oh baby I love you  
Baby, bay I need you

New York City is a thousand miles away  
And if you ask me, I'll tell you that's OK  
Now I'm not trying to put the big apple down  
'Cause they don't need a man like me in town  
I pick cotton down on the Dixie line  
Work hard all day tryin' to make a dime  
But that's alright, that's OK by me  
'Cause that's the way that it was meant to be  
  
Big city, hard times don't bother me  
I'm a country boy, I'm as happy as I can be  
  
I don't like smoke chokin' up my air  
And some of those city folks well they don't care  
I don't like cars buzzing around  
I don't even want a piece of concrete in my town  
I like sunshine, fresh clean air  
Makes me feel like you wouldn't care but  
That's all right, each to his own  
But one smell from the city  
And this country boy is gone  
Big city, hard times don't bother me  
I'm a country boy, I'm as happy as I can be  
  
Well, I don't want to even read about it  
  
Let me tell you something, let me tell you true  
What's right for me might not be right for you  
Well, you live your way, I'll live mine  
And I hope that your happy all the time  
I pick cotton down on the Dixie line  
Work hard all day tryin' to make a dime  
But that's all right, that's OK by me  
'Cause that's the way that it was supposed to be  
  
Big city, hard times never bother me  
I'm a country boy, I'm as happy as I can be  
  
Let me tell ya...I said  
Big city, hard times never bother me  
I'm a country boy, I'm as happy as I can be  
Ooh, that's my way, baby  
I don't want you to even tell me about the big city  
I don't want to read about it...

There's a rumor goin' 'round on the backside of town  
Jake is out to get some revenge  
Has fire in his eyes since his brother died  
Shot down by a so-called friend  
  
For a fifty dollar gram is what the neighbors say  
Drugs had control of his life  
Caught up on crack you're tryin' to think back  
The devil had him hooked you could see it in his eyes  
It's a killer  
  
There's a cold house at the corner of the street  
The kids come and go there at night  
Jerry drove up in front of the house  
Somebody pulled out a knife  
Jerry freaked out and went for his gun  
Shot him right between the eyes  
All he ever wanted was a twenty dollar high  
But now he's locked up for the rest of his life  
  
[Chorus]  
It's a killer there's no way out baby once your in  
It's a killer steal from your family  
Then you'll turn on your friends  
It's a killer it can happen to you  
  
So don't you never, never give in  
It's a killer  
  
The neighborhood I used to call home  
These days it's lookin' like a war zone  
Unemployment on the rise but the black market thrives  
Money just keeps changin' hands  
The laws are gettin' tough sometimes it's not enough  
To satisfy supply and demand  
  
Trouble breaks out there's fightin' in the streets  
Bullets flyin' all around  
An innocent child caught in the line of fire  
All because there weren't enough drugs to go around  
  
[Chorus: x2]

Well ever since I met you babe you've been running around  
Spendin' my hard earned money on any ol' man in town  
I've been your fool  
Oh I've been your fool  
I've been a fool ever since mama I met you  
  
Now I got something to you mama, ain't gonna say no lie  
Ain't gonna stand no runnin' around, don't wanna hear no alibi  
I've been your fool  
Oh I've been your fool  
I've been a fool ever since mama I met you  
  
You've taken every thing I had, you hurt me deep inside  
Money wasn't good enough, you had to take my pride  
I've been your fool  
Oh I've been your fool  
I've been a fool ever since mama I met you  
  
Oh, I've been a fool baby  
Yes I have  
  
Now I got something to you mama, ain't gonna say no lie  
Ain't gonna stand no runnin' around, don't wanna hear no alibi  
I've been your fool  
Oh I've been your fool  
I've been a fool ever since mama I met you  
  
You've taken every thing I had, you hurt me deep inside  
Money wasn't good enough, you had to take my pride  
I've been your fool  
Oh I've been your fool  
I've been a fool ever since mama I met you

You got to lock your doors, keep the world out  
We're closin' ourselves in  
If you watch the news it'll scare you to death  
To hell and back again  
The only justice here's at the wrong end of a gun  
Got the criminal makin' the laws got the good men on the run  
I've seen enough  
  
We don't own anything we've got we've givin' it all away  
But that don't make no sense to me you know who's gonna pay  
It's the man in the factory workin' twelve hours a day  
The woman workin' in the restaurant with another kid on the way  
  
[Chorus]  
Isn't anything in this life sacred anymore  
We can't lose what we've got it's worth fightin' for  
I've seen enough, I've seen enough to make a grown man cry  
  
A man's standin' by the road a sign in his hand  
He don't want your charity he says I ain't no beggar man  
All I need is a chance to get back on my feet  
But we just pass him by well it could be you or me  
I've seen enough  
I ain't the kind to just sit back and watch the world go 'round  
It's not too late to change let's turn this shit around  
  
[Chorus]

This old town ain't been the same  
Since this old boys been gone  
Lord I still got some good friends  
But I feel so all alone  
All I hear is disco  
See pretty boys with high heels on  
Well, some people sure hate me  
And police dog me round  
Well, the only place I'm welcome  
Is on the west side of town  
Well, I'm on the wanted posters  
I can't show my face in town, alright  
Play this one for south side  
Jacksonville, I love you  
But you don't want me around  
Jacksonville, you raised me  
And this is where I got my sound  
Although I'm your outlaw  
I still love my hometown, all around  
Ahh, this is for the west side boys  
This old town ain't been the same  
Since your native sons been gone  
Lord, I still got some old friends  
But I am so all alone  
All I hear is disco  
See pretty boys with high heels on  
Well, you can keep your disco  
Pretty boys with high heels on  

A boy gets crazy when he's sittin' at the bar  
Don't you mess with Jake don't you push him too far  
Rotgut whiskey and homemade wine  
Make a good country boy just lose his mind  
Like a runaway train rollin' through the night the boy ain't got no fear  
Like a race car hittin' the wall it gets hard to steer  
Waitin' for the smoke to clear  
  
Betty got caught in the back of Bobby's car  
Bobby got caught with his hand in the cookie jar  
Her Daddy blew a fuse and went for his gun  
Now Bobby and Betty they're on the run  
Like a runaway train rollin' thought the night nothin's gonna stop them now  
Gotta keep on moving cover their tracks somehow  
  
Like a runaway train rollin' through the night  
The kids ain't got no fear  
Daddy swears bang is the last sound Bobby's gonna hear oh  
Waitin' for the smoke to clear  
  
Daddy finally caught 'em and he emptied his gun  
Put a dead end to all of Bobby's fun oh  
Good god almighty for heaven's sakes  
Betty's Daddy turned out to be Jake  
  
Like a runaway train rollin' through the night  
Jake ain't got no fear  
No hangman judge gonna give the boy 99 years  
  
Here sits Jake in the back of this bar  
Sippin' on an ice cold beer  
If the law had a clue all they'd do is look right here  
They'd see Jake  
Waitin' for the smoke to clear waitin' for  
Oh

Are you a saint then don't be a stranger  
Were you sent down from heaven to show me the way  
And if you ain't then I see a danger  
You better take a minute and hear what I've got to say  
  
[Chorus]  
'cause I'll keep on tryin' to put it straight to you  
You better give it straight to me  
'cause most women seem to have a good time  
Makin' a fool out of me  
I'm keepin' my faith I've made up my mind  
I've got nothin' left to lose just lay it on the line  
  
I'm keepin' my faith yea I'll find the one  
Who won't steal me blind who won't turn and run  
I'm keepin' my faith I'm trustin' in you  
So don't treat me like those other ones do  
Ain't no gettin' 'round it tell me to my face  
Do you think I'm a fool for keepin' my faith in you  
  
I'll treat you right I'll do you better  
I won't disappoint you I won't make you cry  
My friends tell me if you let her  
She'll empty your pockets she'll spend you dry  
  
[Chorus: x2]

I don't read the paper, I don't watch the news  
Life's good in this small town, population 62  
Our bank ain't been held-up since 1932  
Our doors are always unlocked  
But not for long I'm tellin' you  
  
[Chorus]  
'cause I know time's are gonna change  
I know life will never be the same  
I see please tell me it ain't so  
They're all movin' in surroundin' me  
No place left to go  
My oh my you can kiss your freedom goodbye  
  
Used to have a small town drugstore  
Where old men liked to meet  
That store's gone out of business  
They're sellin' drugs out in the streets  
The new kids like to spray paint  
They've got a lot to say  
Sure do have a way with words  
Taught me a few today  
  
[Chorus 2]  
'cause I know time's are gonna change  
I know life will never be the same  
I see small town folks like me  
Are gonna have to change the way we do things cause eventually  
My oh my you can kiss your freedom goodbye  
Kiss it goodbye  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Chorus 2]

Oh. Now when you think the time's flying  
Take a look around  
'Cause babies are dying from disease  
Sleeping out on the ground  
  
People never seen the tortured eyes  
From a foreign land. No  
When you see somebody who's down and out  
Lend a helpin' hand  
  
You better, lend a helpin' hand. If you can  
Lend a helpin' hand  
Do it if you can  
  
Oh. Every time you feed your face  
Do you bow your head  
Hunger kills each and every day  
Won't you share your bread  
  
If you've ever felt the pain inside  
I know you'd understand  
When you see somebody who's down and out  
Lend a helpin' hand  
  
You better, lend a helpin' hand. If you can  
Lend a helpin' hand  
Do it if you can  
  
Oh. Every time you feed that face  
Do you look around  
For somebody right in your own neighborhood  
Sleepin' out on the ground  
  
And do some down south jukin'  
If you've ever felt the pain inside  
I know you'd understand  
When you see somebody who's down and out  
  
Lend a helpin' hand  
Why don't you, lend a helpin' hand. If you can  
Lend a helpin' hand  
Won't you please lend a helpin' hand

Mmm...  
I listen, and still I haven't heard  
Tell me what is the word  
And if I ever heard it would it be clear as water  
Oh tears run down your face  
Reflects the human race  
We're all caught up with winnin' losin' time and space  
  
Life's lessons  
So you think you know it all  
But you're headin' for a fall  
Ooh to make it back again  
You'll have to crawl and step back  
Take a look around  
Are your feet still on the ground  
Can we find you in the section of lost and found  
  
Never think you got it figured out  
'Cause when you do you begin to doubt  
It's time for you to open your eyes  
  
Will we look back and see what we've done  
Will we be proud or ashamed of what we've become  
Will we realize we all share one fate  
Or is this another life's lesson... Too late  
  
Oohh...  
Never think you've got it figured out  
'Cause when you do you begin to doubt  
It's time for you to open your eyes  
  
Oohh...  
Will we look back and see what we've done  
Will we be proud or ashamed of what we've become  
Will we realize we all share one fate  
Is this another life's lesson... Too late  
  
Will we look back and see what we've done  
Oohh...Oohh...  
Will we realize we all share one fate  
Oohh life's lessons  
Oohh...Oohh...Oohh yeah life's lessons  
Oohh... life's lessons  
  
Will we look back and see what we've done  
Will we realize we all share one fate

Two young lovers meet and take each others hand  
They say I do in the name of the lord  
Livin' as one givin' all they can  
Then the pressures come and a child is born  
Young girl cradles the child in her arms  
The man's home late and his day's too long  
They're both unable to spend some time alone  
That everybody needs to have  
That's the thing that keeps love strong  
  
[Chorus]  
Love don't always come easy  
And sometimes love it can hurt  
Words don't always come easy  
It's worth a try we're gonna make it work  
'cause love don't always come easy  
  
Without warning many go a different way  
And travel that road lookin' for someone  
Their lives unravel a little more every day  
This ain't no time to turn and run  
It's a crime to throw it all away  
  
[Chorus]

It said 3:30 on my watch  
Big show don't start 'till 9:00  
Thought a cold one sure would hit the spot  
She started pouring shots  
It was only me and her in there  
"Let's get outta here"  
Might lose my job but I don't care  
Come along if you dare  
Lay down my tailgate  
Hey boy what'chu say?!  
Do a little day drinkin'  
A little bit of love makin'  
A whole lot of world shakin'  
Then we'll do it again  
Do it again  
Start from the sun shinin'  
Go until the stars light up the sky  
Boy don't you leave me hangin'  
'Cause it's never too late  
To get down and dirty!  
Low down and dirty  
I turned up her radio  
She started dancin' real slow  
Like she was puttin' on a show  
Three hours left to rock and roll  
Wet sweat was pourin' off her skin  
Her body made me wanna sin  
Right then my buzz was kickin' in  
She had a devil's grin  
And then her boss drove by  
She flipped them the bird  
She looked me in the eye and said  
You give me the urge!  
To do a little day drinkin'  
A little bit of love makin'  
A whole lot of world shakin'  
Then we'll do it again  
Do it again  
Start from the sun shinin'  
Go until the stars light up the sky  
Boy don't you leave me hangin'  
'Cause it's never too late  
To get down and dirty!  
Low down and dirty!  
Do a little day drinkin'  
A little bit of love makin'  
Do a little day drinkin'  
A little bit of love makin'  
A whole lot of world shakin'  
Then we'll do it again  
Do it again  
Start from the sun shinin'  
Go until the stars light up the sky  
Boy don't you leave me hangin'  
'Cause it's never too late  
To get down and dirty!

MMmmmMMMmmm...  
Well it took so long for me to realize  
That my destiny was right before my eyes  
If it were up to me to travel through this life  
I'd find an open space for me to live out all my dreams  
  
I'm such a lucky man, I try to be a stronger man  
I shed a tear or two but that don't make me a weaker man  
It's made me a better man, I've given all I can  
To a world that sometimes thinks that I'm a lesser man  
  
I remember all the things I've been through  
Gave myself to all those people I once knew  
I'm such a lucky man  
  
I'd like to thank you for the times that you have been with me  
I hope it meant as much to you to share these memories  
There's a guiding light that always seems to shine on me  
If I did it again I'd be happy 'til the end  
  
I'm a lucky man, I try to be a stronger man  
I shed a tear or two but that don't make me a weaker man  
It's made me a better man, I've given all I can  
To a world that sometimes thinks that I'm a lesser man  
  
I remember all the things I've been through  
Gave myself to all those people I once knew  
I'm such a lucky man  
  
It's right here in the moonlight...  
Whooohhhooohhhh  
I'm a lucky man, I try to be a stronger man  
I shed a tear or two but that don't make me a weaker man  
It's made me a better man, I've given all I can  
To a world that sometimes thinks that I'm a lesser man  
I'm a lucky man  
Yeah  
  
MMMmmmMMMmmm....I'm a lucky man  
Whoooohhhooohhhh... just a lucky man

"Well when I was a young-un they used to teach me to play music like this
here..."  
  
When I look in your face baby  
When I look in your eyes  
I can tell pretty mama I been wastin' time  
'Cause you don't really love me  
You just love me for what I am  
But you best treat me right, woman  
Gonna lose your money man  
  
Well when I first met you baby, you was a red light girl  
But I tried to take you to better world  
But you would not listen  
Still you think I am a fool  
Well you had it made in the shade, baby  
Don't let that tree fall down on you  
  
Well I work the railroad each and every day  
Well I work real hard tryin' to make my pay  
Lord I never tell you what you supposed to say  
Girl you had it made in the shade  
Don't let that tree fall down on you

She'd wake us up early  
Every mornin'  
She'd help us say our prayers  
Every night  
She was always there to help us  
Through the hard times  
We could count on her  
To make everything alright  
  
I remember swingin' on the front porch  
Papa said, there's somethin  
I need to say tonight  
Mama's been sick for a long time  
Let's pray to God  
She can make it through the night  
  
[Chorus]  
"Mama don't wanna say goodbye"  
She said  
"Wipe those tears from your eyes"  
"Mama, I don't wanna say goodbye"  
It was written in the heavens  
And the skies above  
"Son, I gave you birth  
Showed you all my love"  
"I can't think of this life without you  
It's hard to try  
Mama, I'm afraid to say goodbye"  
  
"Now kids  
I've been hangin' on a long time  
I hate to leave this world  
Before you're grown  
Remember everything  
That I've taught you  
Remember all the good times  
When I'm gone"  
  
[Chorus]  
  
She whispered in my ear  
Before she passed away  
"Son, it's time to be a man  
Ain't nothin' left to say  
Jesus walked on water, I know it's true  
When it comes time, he'll call you home  
I hope you're ready too"  
  
[Chorus]

Michelle, little girl I need you baby  
More than the air I breathe  
My love for you grows stronger babe  
My words you must believe  
Well I need to see you laugh again  
And I want to see you smile  
Michelle, little girl I love you baby  
You're my only child  
Michelle, little girl the pain for you  
Is hurting me inside  
At night I think of you sometimes  
I lean my head and cry  
I need to see you laugh again  
And I wanna see you smile  
Michelle, little girl I love you baby  
You're my only child  
Michelle, little girl I need you baby  
More than the air I breathe  
My love for you grows stronger babe  
My words you must believe

And I wanna see you smile  
Michelle, little girl I love you baby  
You're my only child  

She's on the left, I'm on the right  
Oh, here comes trouble and I  
Ain't even seen her yet  
Oh, she's something I'll regret  
She's got it good, I got it bad  
Can't seem to get her walk  
And her talk outta my head  
Oh, you know I'm just a mess  
  
[Chorus]  
Give it up, give it up  
Give it to me  
Can't you see honey  
I'm down on my knees  
Wanna feel your touch  
I need you so much  
Don't you know I come with  
A money back guarantee  
(Oh you ain't gonna get my money)  
  
I'll buy the house, you drive my car  
I'll take you anywhere  
Oh, you can call my bluff  
I will shower you with  
Diamonds and rings  
I'll feel a little angel baby  
Can't you see  
  
Wanna feel your touch  
I need you so much  
Don't you know I come with  
A money back guarantee  
Oh, you can have it all baby  
Here it comes, here it comes  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah oh oh  
Money back, money back guarantee  
Money back, money back guarantee  
Money back, money back guarantee  
Money back, money back guarantee  
Yeah yeah  
Money back, money back guarantee  
Yeah, yeah, oh the girl I see  
Oh, you can have it all baby  
Say baby, money back guarantee  
Oh, you can keep your  
Money back guarantee

This song goes out to all the money men  
  
He drives around in a fancy car  
Smokes those long Cuban cigars  
He don't know how to play guitar  
He can't sing but still the pretty girls think he's a star  
  
We play music got families to feed  
Ain't good with numbers and he knows we can't read  
If we get a dollar you know he gets three  
It ain't hard to figure out it's as simple as can be  
Don't ask me ask the money man  
  
These boys are livin' in a fantasy land  
I just keep 'em on the road so they can pay the money man  
I'll be long gone before they understand  
My promises are strong like a road made out of sand  
  
I wanna be your money man  
My mortgage is picked up by the band  
I wanna be your money man  
The boys, oh they're sleepin' out in the van  
  
Don't ask me ask the money man  
You boys are livin' in fantasy land  
You signed the dotted line I'm takin' all I can  
Your money's lookin' good in my retirement plan  
That's just the way it is when your playin' in a band  
  
That's my money man down on his knees  
He ain't prayin' but he damn sure ought to be  
He's at a place where money doesn't grow on trees  
And all his prison buddies doin' more than shoot the breeze  
How does it feel no money man  
Not too good  
What did you do with my money man  
Well I a, well a you know a,  
How does it feel to be a honey man  
Are you sure that your still a man  
  
Aw your dressed up like a little girl  
Just shootin' the breeze down on your knees  
Money man, oh money man

Mister Banker  
Mister please, how much does money mean  
Won't you reconsider Mister  
Won't you do this thing for me  
  
Ain't got no house  
Ain't got no car  
All I got, lord, is my guitar  
But you can have that Mister Banker  
  
Won't you bury my papa for me  
Oh Mister Banker please  
Listen to how that sound  
  
I would not be here on my knees  
But hey Mister Banker  
It means so much to me  
Oh won't you reconsider Mister  
Won't you do this thing for me  
  
I told you Mister  
I ain't got no house  
Ain't got no car  
  
I got me a 1950 Les Paul guitar  
Won't you take it Mister Banker  
Won't you bury my papa for me  
Oh Mister Banker please

Woman, I have to leave you  
I can't stay where there is no pay  
And I don't care where I'm goin' to  
It's been so long since I've been gone  
Lord I'm tired and I want to go home  
My throat is raw from singing the blues  
  
Need all my friends to talk to  
Now yes I do  
Need all my friends to talk to  
  
I'm gonna search around until I find a friend  
Who will believe in me for what I am  
Sing my song 'til it hurts  
  
Play my music 'til I hit pay dirt  
Now I've got to sing my song  
Play my music, do the things I love  
  
It's been so long since I've been gone  
Lord I'm tired and I want to go home  
My throat is raw from singing the blues  
  
Need all my friends to talk to  
Now yes I do  
Need all my friends to talk to

In this world that we all live in  
Its all takin' and there's no givin'  
Before its too late, something's gotta change  
  
Go to work every day for the dollar  
Doesn't matter we're all blue collar  
At the end of the day  
Nothin' lost, nothin' gained  
But its about time we realized  
Its about time we opened our eyes  
Take one step back and look at yourself  
Do you like what you see  
Oh no  
Cause its never too late  
Doesn't matter who you are  
Its never too late  
Hold on to your dreams and they will take you far  
Cause its never too late  
No, no, no  
  
So many times I've seen you cryin'  
But I see you out there still tryin'  
Workin' hard just to get through another day  
As a friend I'm here to remind you  
We all have a place to belong to  
Who am I? See I'm just like you  
But its about time we realized  
Its about time we opened our eyes  
Take one step back and look at yourself  
Do you like what you see  
Oh no  
Cause its never too late  
Doesn't matter who you are  
Its never too late  
Hold on to your dreams and they will take you far  
Cause its never too late  
  
We all need a helpin' hand sometimes  
And I need one if you were mine  
So right here, right now  
You can count on me  
Just open your eyes and you will see  
That its never too late  
No, no, no  
Cause its never too late, it doesn't matter who you are  
Its never too late  
Hold on to your dreams and they will take you far  
Cause its never too late  
Cause its never too late, it doesn't matter who you are  
Its never too late  
You don't need a guitar son to be a star  
Cause its never too late  
No, no, no  
Its never too late  
No  
Cause its never too late  
Take a look around  
Cause its never too late

Ain't no reason why I should feel this way  
I got everything going for now  
Might have it all, some people say  
But each time I think of your smiling face  
For I took upon inside now  
In your sweet love I can take  
'Cause I lost the best thing  
I miss you more everyday  
And I know deep inside me  
No one can take your place, oh no  
Sometimes when I am lonely  
And I can feel your presence near  
Well, I look at your picture  
And your sweet voice I can often hear  
But every time I really see you  
Oh, my heart often smiles  
And at that precise moment  
I break up all inside  
'Cause I lost the best thing  
I miss you more everyday  
And I know deep inside me  
No one can take your place, oh no  
Oh, all alone, I've lost you  
T'was nothing you could do  
I lost my only creation  
And now I'm paying all the due  
But every time I really see you  
Oh, my heart often smiles  
And at that precise moment  
I break up all inside  
'Cause I lost the best thing  
I miss you more everyday  
And I know deep inside me  
No one can take your place, oh no  

You better listen my brother  
'cause if you do you can hear  
There are voices still callin' from across the years  
And they're cryin' across the ocean  
And they're cryin' across the land  
And they will until we all come to understand  
  
That none of us are free  
None of us are free  
None of us are free if one of us is chained  
None of us are free  
  
Well there are people in the darkness  
And they just can't see the light  
And if we don't say it's wrong then that says it's right  
We got to feel for each other  
Let our brothers know we're here  
Got to get the message and send it out loud and clear  
  
That none of us are free  
None of us are free  
None of us are free if one of us is chained  
None of us are free  
Well it's the single truth  
We all need to see  
That none of are free if one of us is chained  
None of us are free  
  
Well I swear to you salvation isn't very hard to find  
None of us can find it on our own  
We got to join together. Spirit, heart and mind  
All the are suffering, knows they're not alone  
  
None of us are free  
None of us are free  
  
If you just look around you  
You're see what I say  
'cause the world's gettin' smaller each passin' day  
Now it's time to make some changes  
Now it's time all realized  
That the truth is shinin' right before our eyes  
  
'cause none of us are free  
None of us are free  
None of us are free if one of us is chained  
None of us are free  
  
Well it's the very heart of humanity  
'cause none of us are free if one of us is chained  
None of us are free  
  
None of us, none of us  
None of us, none of us  
None of us, none of us are free  
  
None of us, none of us  
None of us, none of us  
None of us, none of us are free  
  
None of us are free  
None of us are free  
None of us are free if one of us is chained  
None of us are free  
'cause it's the very truth  
We all need to see  
That none of us are free if one of us is chained  
None of us are free

I said baby mama, I don't know your name  
But I said baby, sugar I can play your game  
Every night when we leave the hall  
I see you hanging around  
You want to ride in my big black car baby  
Want to go uptown  
  
[Chorus:]  
I know who you are baby  
I know what they call you girl  
Never put you down baby  
I'm just like you baby, I'm on the hunt  
  
I know lady  
People gonna talk about you and me  
Let me say one thing mama, sugar I do as I please  
And if you want to love me baby, I'm your man  
And all those high-falutin' society people  
I don't care if they don't understand  
  
[Chorus]  
  
My daddy told me a long time ago  
Said there's two things son  
Two things you should know  
And in these two things you must take pride  
That's a horse and woman, yeah  
Well both of them you ride

Somewhere the sun is shining  
On some unhappy day  
Somewhere there's people laughing  
They think they've found the way  
  
But its not me  
Its not me, no no now  
Its not me, its not me, its not me, its not me  
I'm not the one  
  
Well sure I used to cry, but I used to laugh to  
I had ups as well as downs you see  
But I been down now for so long  
I've forgotten all my dreams.  
  
Yeah it must be me  
It must be me, you know now  
It's not me, its not me, its not me, its not me  
I'm not the one in the sun  
  
Since I became I've wondered what I've become  
Lord I know it can't be much longer before  
I find my place in sun  
  
Sometimes I wonder will I figure something out  
Will I find a reason good enough to live  
Lord if it don't dawn on me pretty soon  
I think something's gonna give  
  
Yeah it might be me  
Yeah it just might be me, yea  
Its not me, no it can't be  
'Cause I'm not the one in the sun  
  
No I'm not the one  
Yea I'm not the one  
But I'm not the one  
Sorry to say I'm not the one

How can you stand there smilin'  
After all you've done  
You know it seems to make you happy  
When you've hurt someone  
Twice before you fooled me  
With your deceivin' and lyin'  
Come in and close the door  
One more time, one more time  
  
Yeah you've been gone so long  
No one knows where  
And you say that you still love me  
Then show me you care  
'Cause you got what it takes sweet mama  
To make a man feel fine  
So I'll take the word of a liar  
One more time, one more time  
  
Girl you've got me hungry  
Losin' my mind  
I know I'm playin' with fire  
Get burned every time  
Yes I'm a fool for you baby I can't deny  
But I got to have your sweet love  
One more time, one more time  
  
Girl you've got me hungry  
Losin' my mind  
I know I'm playin' with fire  
I get burned every time  
Yes I'm a fool for you mama I can't deny  
But I got to have your sweet love  
One more time, one more time  
  
Yes I'm her fool once more  
I can read her brown eyes  
But when the rooster crows tomorrow  
Well its her turn to cry  
I'm headed down that old road  
She lost her free ride  
So tonight I'll take what I paid for  
One more time, one more time  
One more time

Five AM in the mornin', whiskey still runnin' through my head  
I could get out of bed and maybe I'll just have another cigarette  
As long as I can remember seems all I've ever done is work  
The boss is a jerk and I ain't payin' the rent  
Spent my whole life shovelin' dirt  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm gonna get outta hell in my dodge  
Can't take this anymore  
Gonna go downtown pick up my girl  
There ain't nothin' worth waitin' for  
Take the road less traveled  
Spend my life behind the wheel  
Gonna get outta hell in my dodge  
Freedom made out of steel  
  
There's a knock on the door from the sheriff  
Askin' me where I was last night  
Seems somebody lookin' a lot like me  
Had takin' up with his wife  
He said son if I ever catch him  
There's gonna be some hell to pay  
He'll be gone for good if I see him again  
'cause I just might blow him away  
  
[Chorus]  
  
What's a poor man supposed to do  
Stuck in the middle and trapped by the blues  
Baby, I'm sick of these blues  
  
I'm gonna get outta hell in my dodge  
Can't take this anymore  
Gonna go downtown pick up my girl  
There ain't nothin' worth waitin' for  
Well I don't care if I'm wrong or right  
Gotta split this town tonight  
Gonna get outta hell in my dodge  
Live my life behind the wheel  
I'm gonna get outta hell in my dodge  
My freedom made out of steel

Well sometimes I lose my direction  
And sometimes I jump off track  
But when I hide out baby, I can always get it back  
I need to feel the cool breeze,  
In my face, the rumble of the engine, between my legs  
Hey little sister you can color me gone  
  
[Chorus]  
So if I want to stay out all night long you can't stop me from runnin wild,  
Don't you worry how long I'm gone, I come back every once in a while  
I pick em up, and lay em all down  
I never like my feet to ever hit the ground  
Don't miss when I'm gone 'cause I'll be around,  
I'm a free spirit baby pick me up, and lay me on down  
  
Now I know that I got me a good life,  
Jim Bean, and women they treat me right  
I make my own rules, like it or not  
Now don't misunderstand me baby, I give in every once in a while,  
Well its times like honey, I'll leave you with a smile  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I've been here, I've been there, I've been everywhere,  
I wouldn't tell you no lies,  
And just like me you're a wild one,  
Won't you take me for a ride  
I pick em up, and lay em all down  
I don't like my feet to ever hit the ground,  
Don't miss me while I'm gone 'cause I'll be around yeah  
I'm a free spirit baby pick me up,  
And lay me on down

Daddy was a Cajun, raised on Southern land  
And so my kinfolks tell me, was a street-fightin' man.  
Well, they rushed him down to see the doctor  
"Hey doctor, won't you check his head?"  
The only thing that was wrong with him  
Was Johnny Walker's Red  
He drank ole poison whiskey  
'Til it killed him dead.  
  
It happened back in the bayou many years ago  
Satan came to take him and he did it real slow  
Well, they rushed him back to see the doctor  
The doctor just shook his head,  
"Twenty years of rotgut whiskey  
Done killed the poor man dead."  
He drank ole poison whiskey  
'Til it killed him dead.  
  
Take a tip from me, people... brothers can't you see  
Ain't no future in ole poison whiskey.  
They're gonna rush you down to see the doctor,  
The doctor's gonna shake his head.  
The only thing he's gonna tell ya  
"Stop drinkin' Johnny Walker's Red  
Don't drink poison whiskey, don't you drink it boy.

There ain't no poor man  
Born with a silver spoon  
And there ain't no wise man  
Who learned it all in school  
A politician's promise  
Can make you feel like a fool  
But when they get the power  
They're the first to break the golden rule  
We work that 40 acres like riders on a mule  
Climb that mountain  
Reach the sky  
Hangin' on for a good laugh  
For a piece of that American pie  
Hey nothin's easy  
Nothin's for free  
In the world of dog eat dog  
Oh people, that's a poor man's dream  
Hey Mr. Walton  
Lend me a dime  
You know I'll repay ya  
But it's gonna take me some time  
I'm standing at the crossroads  
Just about to roll the dice  
I got a dream in my heart  
  
Whatever it takes  
I know I gotta pay the price  
We work that 40 acres like riders on a mule  
Climb that mountain  
Reach the sky  
Hangin' on for a good laugh  
For a piece of that American pie  
Hey nothin's easy  
Nothin's for free  
In the world of dog eat dog  
Oh people, that's a poor man's dream  
We work that 40 acres like riders on a mule  
Climb that mountain  
Reach the sky  
Hangin' on for a good laugh  
For a piece of that American pie  
Hey nothin's easy  
Nothin's for free  
In the world of dog eat dog  
Oh people, that's a poor man's dream  
Hey nothin's easy  
Nothin's for free  
In the world of dog eat dog  
Oh people, that's a poor man's dream  
Oh  
It's a poor man's dream

Well, just keep on runnin' mama, 'till you can't run no more  
You no your sister told your mama 'bout the boy next door  
Well, I see your sugar daddy comin' around the corner  
I wonder if he knows your the preacher's daughter, oh no  
  
Well, I seen you through your window, baby, many times before

Well, keep on runnin' mama, 'till you can't get no ?

And I'm takin' about the preacher's daughter  
Doin' what she hadn't oughta  
Gettin' on down  
With every stud in town

I jumped off a boxcar down around Tennessee  
I was cold tired and dirty hungry as I could be  
But I had my guitar and a hundred railroad songs  
So I asked the policeman  
Can I stay here long  
He said Mr. Hobo you got to go now  
We don't want you around  
See I'm trying to build a respectable town  
And we don't need a hobo like you around  
  
So I left that town, Lord with my guitar in my hand  
Still cold and tired, kinda mad at the man  
But this life that I chose to live, sometime's strange  
See I'm trying to learn about the old music from ridin' the train  
I'm a hobo I know, but thta's the price I pay  
Guess I'll write me another song while I'm on my way  
Catch me another train and this is what I'll say  
Mr Choo-choo train take me away  
  
I'm goin' to ride this train Lord until I find out  
What Jimmie Rogers and the Hag was all about  
See I play this rock n roll and I think that's fine  
But I want to go back a little further in time  
I'm a hobo I know but that's the price I pay  
Guess I'll write me another song while I'm on my way  
Catch me another train and this is what I'll say  
Mr Choo-choo train take me away

That's right  
Yeah  
  
Big bad machine still makin' the scene  
Big wheels keep on turnin'  
Step on the gas, gone in a flash  
Rubber just keeps on burnin'  
'Cause every night is a Saturday night  
No matter what town we're in  
Open the doors, kick out the lights  
Just let the party begin  
  
We're just watchin' the world from this big ass bus  
The highway is home to folks like us  
Makin' good music, keepin' it alive  
Slip in slip out, of your rockin' little town tonight  
Yeah that's what we do..  
  
Get into town, lay our head down  
Really ain't nothin' to do  
Watchin' the clock, get ready to rock

'Cause every night is a Saturday night  
No matter what town we're in  
Open the doors, kick out the lights  
Yeah let the party begin  
  
We're just watchin' the world from this big ass bus  
The highway is home to folks like us  
Makin' good music, keepin' it alive

Of your rockin' little town tonight  
  
So good to see you all again

Ridin' on a greyhound, countin' those white lines  
Destination I don't know and I'm feelin' like I'm dyin'  
Well ten years on this road, my its took its toll  
But the man with the plan says the band has got to go  
I said roll gypsy roll  
Lord just pick up your bags and go  
  
Met many a woman on my way down the line  
Every woman that I met I left satisfied  
I made lots of money, just how much I don't know  
But most of the money I done stuck up my nose  
I said roll gypsy roll  
Lord just pick up your bags and go  
  
Gypsy's life's a story and its one that's never told  
He's always hungry, he's always on the go  
With no tomorrow, its how it seems to be  
When you're moving around from town to town  
  
Made lots of money just how much I don't know  
But most of the money I done stuck up my nose  
And maybe that's the reason I don't know where I'm going  
I don't know

Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer  
Had a very shiny nose  
And if you ever saw him  
You would even say it glows  
  
All of the other reindeer  
Used to laugh and call him names  
They never let poor Rudolph  
Join in any reindeer games  
  
Then one foggy Christmas Eve  
Santa came to say  
"Rudolph with your nose so bright  
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?"  
  
Then how the reindeer loved him  
As they shouted out with glee  
"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer  
You'll go down in history"  
  
Then one foggy Christmas Eve  
Santa came to say  
"Hey, Rudolph with your nose so bright  
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?"  
  
Then how the reindeer loved him  
As they shouted out with glee  
"Hey, Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer  
You'll go down in history

Out of all the reindeer you know you're the mastermind  
Run, run Rudolph, Randolph's not too far behind  
Run, run Rudolph, Santa's got to make it to town  
Randolph he can hurry, he can take the freeway down.  
  
And away went Rudolph a-whizzing like a merry-go-round  
Said Santa to a boy child what have you been longing for?  
All I want for Christmas is a rock and roll electric guitar  
And away went Rudolph a-whizzing like a shooting star  
Run, run Rudolph, Santa's got to make it to town  
  
Can't you make him hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down  
And away went Rudolph a-whizzing like a merry-go-round  
Said Santa to a girl child what would you like most to get?  
I want a little baby doll that can cry, scream and wet  
And away went Rudolph a-whizzing like a saber jet  
Run, run Rudolph, run, run Rudolph, a-running like a son-of-a-gun

I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way  
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday  
I called on dear old Santa Claus  
To see what I could see  
He took me to his workshop  
And told his plans to me, so  
  
[Chorus]  
You better watch out, you better not cry  
Better not pout, I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
He's making a list and checking it twice  
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
He sees you when you're sleepin'  
He knows when you're a wake  
He knows if you've been bad or good  
So be good for goodness sake  
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry  
Better not pout, I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
  
With little tin horns and little toy drums  
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo  
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee  
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree  
So! You better watch out, you better not cry  
Better not pout, I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
  
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play  
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day  
You'd better write your letter now  
And mail it right away  
Because he's getting ready  
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So  
  
[Chorus]  
  
With little tin horns and little toy drums  
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo  
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee  
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree  
So! You better watch out, you better not cry  
Better not pout, I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is comin' to town

Mama told me when I was young  
Come sit beside me, my only son  
And listen closely to what I say.  
And if you do this  
It will help you some sunny day.  
Take your time... Don't live too fast,  
Troubles will come and they will pass.  
Go find a woman and you'll find love,  
And don't forget son,  
There is someone up above.  
  
[Chorus:]  
And be a simple kind of man.  
Be something you love and understand.  
Baby, be a simple kind of man.  
Oh won't you do this for me son,  
If you can?  
  
Forget your lust for the rich man's gold  
All that you need is in your soul,  
And you can do this if you try.  
All that I want for you my son,  
Is to be satisfied.  
  
[Chorus:]  
And be a simple kind of man.  
Be something you love and understand.  
Baby, be a simple kind of man.  
Oh won't you do this for me son,  
If you can?  
  
Boy, don't you worry.  
You'll find yourself.  
Follow your heart,  
And nothing else.  
You can do this,  
If you try.  
All that I want for you my son,  
Is to be satisfied.  
  
[Chorus:]  
And be a simple kind of man.  
Be something you love and understand.  
Baby, be a simple kind of man.  
Oh won't you do this for me son,  
If you can?  
  
Baby, be a simple, be a simple man  
Oh, be something you love and understand  
Baby, be a simple kind of man

I was sittin' at home all alone when I heard that telephone ring  
And there on the line was a friend of mine sayin' he wasn't doin' a thing  
So I'm steppin' out on the town tonight to party where the drinks are free  
There's a sweet young thing ready and waitin' on me  
  
[Chorus]  
Young and fine, strike you blind  
Smokestack lightnin' make you lose your mind  
She's got looks that kill can fire at will  
Smokestack lightnin' she's all I need  
  
When we got to the place I got me a taste  
I knew she'd be good for a game  
Dancin' out on the floor she was ready for more  
She knew all the boys by their names  
I said hey sweet thing let me pull your string  
Let me take you home  
I woke up in a hour with my money and my memory gone.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Young and fine strike you blind smokestack lightnin'  
  
[Chorus]

Broken bones, broken hearts  
Stripped down and torn apart  
A little bit of rust  
I'm still runnin'  
Counting miles, counting tears  
Twist of roads, shifting gears  
Year after year  
It's all or nothing  
  
But I'm not home  
I'm not lost  
Still holding on to what I got  
Ain't much left  
Though there's so much that's been stolen  
Guess I've lost everything I've had  
But I'm not dead, at least not yet  
Still alone, still alive, still unbroken  
I'm still alone, still alive, I'm still unbroken  
  
Never captured, never tamed  
Wild horses on the plains  
You can call me lost, I call it freedom  
I feel a spirit in my soul  
It's something Lord I can't control  
I'm never giving up while I'm still breathing  
  
I'm not home  
I'm not lost  
Still holding on to what I got  
Ain't much left  
Though there's so much that's been stolen  
Guess I've lost everything I've had  
I'm not dead, at least not yet  
Still alone, still alive, still unbroken  
I'm still alone, still alive, I'm still unbroken  
  
I'm still unbroken  
  
Still unbroken  
  
Like the wind, like the rain  
Keeps on running through my veins  
Like a river pouring down into the ocean  
I'm out here on the street  
But I'm standing on my feet  
Still alive, still alone, still unbroken  
  
I'm not home  
I'm not lost  
Still holding on to what I got  
Ain't much left  
Though there's so much that's been stolen  
Guess I've lost everything I've had  
But I'm not dead, at least not yet  
Still alive, still alone, still unbroken  
I'm still alone, still alive, I'm still unbroken  
I'm still alone, still alive, I'm still unbroken  
  
I'm still unbroken  
  
I ain't never going down  
  
I'm still unbroken  
Oh

Goin' down to the swamp  
Goin' watch me a hound dog catch a 'coon  
Well, I'm goin' down to the swamp  
Goin' to watch a hound dog catch a 'coon  
You know the hound dog makin' music  
On a summer night by the light of the moon  
  
Oh, fetch my cane pole mama  
Goin' catch a bream or maybe two  
Lord, fetch my cane pole mama  
Goin' catch a bream or maybe two  
When the hound dogs start barkin'  
Sound like ol' Son House singin' the blues  
  
Hound dog sing that  
Swamp, swamp, swamp, swamp music  
Swamp, swamp, swamp, swamp music  
When the hound dog starts singin'  
I ain't got them big ol' city blues  
  
Go ahead pretty mamma  
Lord, just take that city hike  
Said, go ahead pretty mamma  
Lord, just take your city hike  
Well, I'd rather live with the hound dogs  
For the rest of my natural born life  
  
Singin' that  
Swamp, swamp, swamp, swamp music  
Swamp, swamp, swamp, swamp music  
Well, I'd rather live with the hound dogs  
For the rest of my natural born life  
Well, I want to live with the hound dogs  
For the rest of my natural born life

Big wheels keep on turning  
Carry me home to see my kin  
Singing songs about the south-land  
I miss 'ole' 'bamy once again  
And I think it's a sin  
  
Well I heard Mister Young sing about her  
Well I heard ole Neil put her down  
Well, I hope Neil Young will remember  
A southern man don't need him around any how  
  
Sweet home Alabama  
Where the skies are so blue  
Sweet home Alabama  
Lord, I'm coming home to you  
  
In Birmingham they love the Gov'nor  
Now we all did what we could do  
Now Watergate does not bother me  
Does your conscience bother you?  
Tell the truth  
  
Sweet home Alabama  
Where the skies are so blue  
Sweet home Alabama  
Lord, I'm coming home to you  
  
Now Muscle Shoals has got the Swampers  
And they've been known to pick a song or two  
Lord they get me off so much  
They pick me up when I'm feeling blue  
Now how bout you?  
  
Sweet home Alabama  
Where the skies are so blue  
Sweet home Alabama  
Lord, I'm coming home to you

Here we go...  
C'mon...  
I was raised on the west side Shanty Town  
I didn't get up 'til the sun went down  
When your backs against the wall you better get tough  
I learned real quick how to swing and duck  
I was born in the sweet hot Florida sunshine  
Good lookin' women backwoods and moonshine  
Learned more about life on the streets than in school  
Sweet Mama didn't raise no fool (No she didn't)  
Hahahaha...  
Ooooohhh...  
Some folks cheat and some folks lie  
I can judge a man by the look in his eyes  
So don't hand me Jack and try to call it Cola  
I know the difference 'tween shit and shinola  
I was born in the sweet hot Florida sunshine  
Good lookin' women backwoods and moonshine  
Learned more about life on the streets than in the school  
Sweet Mama didn't raise no fool (No she didn't)  
Play it boys..  
MMmmHhmmm...  
Mama was no angel when she taught me right from wrong  
She knew every single note and every word in every single song  
She taught me how to gamble and how to roll the dice  
If it makes you feel good DO IT don't think twice  
I was born in the sweet hot Florida sunshine  
Good lookin' women backwoods and moonshine  
Learned more about life on the streets than in school  
Sweet Mama didn't raise no fool  
I was born in the sweet hot Florida sunshine  
Good lookin' women backwoods and moonshine  
Learned more about life on the streets than in school  
Sweet Mama didn't raise no fool (Noooooo...)  
Talkin' 'bout Mama  
Ooooh I'm tellin' ya sheee...  
Talkin' 'bout sweet, sweet sweet Mama  
Talkin' 'bout sweet sweet sweet, sweet sweet Mama  
Talkin' 'bout sw  
  

Give me a T for Texas, give me a T for Tennessee  
Give me a T for Texas, give me a T for Tennessee  
Give me a T for Thelma, woman made a fool out of me  
  
If you don't want me baby, mama you sure don't got to stall  
If you don't want me baby, mama you sure don't got to stall  
I've had more pretty women than a passenger train could haul  
  
I'm gonna buy myself a shotgun, one with a long shiny barrel  
I'm gonna buy myself a shotgun, one with a long shiny barrel

Alarm Clock ring about a quarter after five  
I've been up all night raisin' hell  
With some friends of mine  
I take one good look in the mirror  
But only one things gettin' clearer  
The way I live I'm lucky to be alive  
  
There I go lying to myself  
Said I wasn't gonna do it  
Next thing ya know  
Here I go again  
Talked myself right into it  
  
Supposed to be to work an hour ago  
When I passed that boss stormin' down the road  
Now there's an angel on my shoulder  
Thinkin' she can win me over  
The Devil's got my number don't you know  
  
There I go lying to myself  
Said I wasn't gonna do it  
Next thing ya know  
Here I go again  
Talked myself right into it  
Maybe, Maybe, have I gone too far this time  
Maybe, Maybe, is my conscience workin' overtime, nah  
  
There's a knockout Georgia peach givin' me the eye  
Well if the truth be known I'm just a little shy  
Turns out she wasn't alone  
She had a six foot chaperon  
But that didn't slow me down  
Don't ask me why  
There I go lying to myself  
Said I wasn't gonna do it  
Next thing ya know  
Here I go again  
I got no one to blame except myself  
Said I wasn't gonna do it  
Next thing ya know  
Here I go again  
Talked myself right into it  
Talked myself,  
Talked myself right into it  
Talked myself, talked myself

Whiskey bottles, and brand new cars  
Oak tree you're in my way  
There's too much coke and too much smoke  
Look what's going on inside you  
Ooooh that smell  
Can't you smell that smell

The smell of death surrounds you

Can't you smell that smell  
Ooooh that smell  
The smell of death surrounds you

Well I used to wake the mornin  
Befor the rooster crowed  
Searchin for soda bottles to get my self some dough  
Brought em down to the corner  
Down to the country store  
Cash em in and give my money to a man named Curtis Lowe  
Old Curt was a black man with white curly hair  
When he had a fifth of wine he didnot have a care  
He used to own and old dobro used to play across his knee  
I'd give old Curt my money he play all day for me  
  
Play me a song Curtis Lowe Curtis Lowe  
Well I got your drinkin money tune up your dobro  
People said he was useless them people all were fools  
'Cause Curtis Lowe was the finest picker to ever play the blues  
  
He looked to be 60 maybe I was 10  
Momma used to whoop me  
But I'd go see him again  
I'd clap my hands, stomp my feet tryin to keep in time  
Well he'd play me a song or 2 then take another drink of wine  
  
Play me a song Curtis Lowe Curtis Lowe  
Well I got your drinkin money tune up your dobro  
People said he was useless but them people all were fools  
'Cause Curtis Lowe was the finest picker to ever play the blues  
  
On the day old Curtis died nobody came to pray  
Old preacher said some words  
They chucked him in the clay  
Well he lived a lifetime playin the black mans blues  
And on the day he lost his life that's all he had to lose  
  
Play me a song Curtie Lowe Curtis Lowe  
I wish that you was here so everyone would know  
People said he was useless but them people all were fools  
'Cause Curtis your finest picker to ever play the blues

Thirty days, Lord, and thirty nights  
I'm coming home on an airplane flight  
Mama waiting at the ticket line  
Tell me son, why do you stand there cryin'?  
  
It was the needle and the spoon  
And a trip to the moon  
Took me away  
Took me away  
  
I've been feeling so sick inside  
Got to get better, Lord, before I die  
Some doctors couldn't help my head, they said  
You'd better quit, son, before you're dead  
  
Quit the needle, quit the spoon  
Quit the trip to the moon  
They gonna take you away  
Lord, they gonna take you away  
  
It was the needle and the spoon  
  
I've seen a lot of people who thought they were cool  
But then again, Lord, I've seen a lot of fools  
I hope you people, Lord, can hear what I say  
You'll have your chance to hit it some day  
  
Don't mess with a needle or a spoon  
Or a trip to the moon  
They'll take you away  
  
Lord, their gonna bury you boy  
Don't mess with the needle  
Now I know, I know, I know, I know, I know

Well the sun don't shine where it used to  
And the angels are hidin' their heads  
People don't listen to their hearts anymore  
Seems the good men all are dead  
There ain't no right, wrong, no in between  
That ain't the constitution that they wrote for me  
Got our heads stuck in somethin' overseas  
Standin' ass deep in hypocrisy  
  
Oh  
Well I found myself out on the open road  
Heading out into the desert  
Lookin' for another world that's waitin' on me  
That none of us can see  
I keep thinkin' to myself as I move along  
Where do we all come from  
Is there religion or another dimension  
Another place and time yeah  
  
Oh  
When my life is over and done  
Finally made my way through it  
Another life has just begun  
Is this the way you do it  
Oh the way  
  
Oh  
Lookin' in the eyes of the man on the moon  
He's starin' down at me  
Wondering what he's thinkin' and if he knows  
Please let me see  
  
Life is like an open door we're all walkin' through  
Do you know the answers, no one knows the truth  
Until we pass on through  
  
When my life is over and done  
Finally made my way through it  
Another life has just begun  
Is this the way to it  
  
Oh  
Walkin' on the world upside down  
It keeps spinnin' round and round  
World upside down  
I'm so tired of all this bullshit goin' down  
Finally made my way through it  
When my life is over and done  
Is this the way you do it  
When my life is over and done  
Finally made my way through it  
Another life has just begun  
This is the way you do it  
Oh the way  
This is the way you do it  
Oh the way

Well, have you ever lived down in the ghetto?  
Have you ever felt the cold wind blow?  
Well, if you don't know what I mean  
Won't you stand up and scream?  
'Cause there's things goin' on that you don't know  
  
Too many lives they've spent across the ocean  
Too much money been spent upon the moon  
Well, until they make it right  
I hope they never sleep at night  
They better make some changes  
And do it soon  
  
Well, they're goin ruin the air we breathe  
Lord have mercy  
They're gonna ruin us all, by and by  
I'm telling all you beware  
I don't think they really care  
I think they just sit up there  
And just get high  
  
Well, have you ever lived down in the ghetto?  
Have you ever felt the cold wind blow?  
Well, if you don't know what I mean  
Won't you stand up and scream?

I'm just a city boy  
But there's a small town side to me  
And I feel it closin' in  
  
Are we too blind to see  
That she's die-in' more each day  
And she's cryin' out to you and me  
  
Chance is comin' when thier gone  
They curse a fool who waits too long  
So lets take care of what we have  
Before the good we know goes bad  
And the beauty fades and just slips away  
  
The dirty air and the die-in' seas  
Will this be the world we leave  
To the wild and young  
And say just look at what we've done  
  
And right before our eyes  
Today's yesterday, could be tomorrow's goodbye  
  
Here comes the rain. it might wash her tears away  
But it doesn't change a thing  
Like my brother before me  
All I can do is write this song and for her I sing  
  
Chance is comin' when we're gone  
They carve in stone what we've done wrong  
So lets take care of what we have  
Before the good we know goes bad  
And the beauty fades and just slips away  
  
The dirty air and the die-in' seas  
Will this be the world we leave  
To the wild and young  
And say just look at what we've done  
  
And right before our eyes  
Today's yesterday could be tomorrow's goodbye  
  
Do you ever think about the future or the past  
Do you ever wonder how long this world will last  
  
So let's take care of what we have  
Before the good we know goes bad  
And the beauty fades and just slips away  
  
The dirty air and the die-in' seas  
Will this be the world we leave  
To the wild and young  
And say just look at what we've done  
  
And right before our eyes  
Now it's right before our eyes  
Today's yesterday, will be tomorrow's goodbye

I was born a travelin' man, that's all Ill ever be  
Moving around from town to town is what makes me so free

This is a story 'bout livin'  
A tale of a long hard road  
Ain't a whole lot of misgivin's  
Of the things that I thought I sowed  
My daddy was a real hard worker  
He said son there will come a day  
Talk ain't always cheap  
And here's what daddy had to say  
With these hands I've made my livin'  
With these hands I've held a child  
With these hands I've climbed a mountain  
Sometimes we forget  
We ain't much different at all  
  
He likes grits, you like the apple  
There ain't nothin' wrong with that  
He says y'all, you say you's  
It all depends on where you're at  
Well a little bit of music is a whole lot of fun  
And its always good for the soul  
From New York City out to California  
You know its only rock and roll  
  
With these hands we come together  
With these hands we can change the world  
With these hands I play my music  
Sometimes we forget  
We ain't much different at all  
  
Oh, not at all  
So what I'm trying to tell you  
Is that I'm only one son of the south  
Its gonna take more than you me and you  
To work this whole thing out  
  
With these hands I've made my livin'  
With these hands I've held a child  
With these hands I've climbed a mountain  
Sometimes we forget  
  
With these hands we come together  
With these hands we can change the world  
With these hands I play my music  
Sometimes we forget  
We ain't much different  
We ain't much different  
Ain't much different  
At all

Well, its eight o'clock in Boise, Idaho

Mister, take us to the show

I'll find a little queen  
And I know I can treat her right.  
  
[Chorus:]  
What's your name, little girl?

Shootin' you straight, little girl?

Back at the hotel  
Lord we got such a mess  
It seems that one of the crew  
Had a go with one of the guests, oh yes  
Well, the police said we can't drink in the bar  
What a shame  
Won't you come upstairs girl  
And have a drink of champagne  
  
What's your name, little girl?  
What's your name?  
Shootin' you straight, little girl?  
For there ain't no shame.

When I come back here next year  
I want to see you again

Shootin' you straight, little girl?  
Well there ain't no shame  
What was your name, little girl?

Is there any questioning why  
Tell me what heaven you're bound for today  
Feel just like I could cry

Little squirrel sitting on a flat slanted rock  
Wondering where the winter meal is coming from  
Tired of fighting for it, gonna lay down my gun  
Just know that my work is done

Said I'm tired of fighting, gonna lay down my gun  
Just know that my work is done  
Just know that my work is done  
Just know that my work is done  
Just know that my work is done

Up every mornin' before the sun  
Takin' my lovin' on the run  
Breakin' my back till the day is done  
I'm gonna punch that time clock and have some fun  
Ain't no easy way to get myself out

Oh-workin' just like you-uh

I made my livin' movin' around

That's just the way it is  
  
So-I keep on workin'  
Like a workin' man do

Seven years of hard luck, comin' down on me  
From the Florida border, yeah up to Nashville, Tennessee  
I worked in every joint you can name, mister every honky tonk  
Along come Mr. Yankee Slicker, sayin' maybe you're what I want  
  
[Chorus]  
Want you to sign your contract  
Want you to sign today  
Gonna give you lots of money  
Workin' For MCA  
  
Nine thousand dollars, that's all we could win  
But we smiled at the Yankee Slicker with a big ol' Southern grin  
They're gonna take me out to California,  
Gonna make me a superstar  
Just pay me all of my money  
And mister maybe you won't get a scar  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Suckers took my money since I was seventeen  
If it ain't no pencil pusher, it got to be a honky tonk queen  
But I'll sign my contract baby, and I want you people to know  
That every penny that I make, I'm gonna see where my money goes  
  
[Chorus]
