Knew you were special from the moment I saw you, I saw you, yeah  
I said angel, oh oh oh oh  
I feel you're closer every time I call you, I call you  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Cause all I see are wings, I can see your wings  
But I know what I am and the life I live, yeah, the life I live  
And even though I sin, maybe we are born to live  
But I know time will tell if we're meant for this, yeah if we're meant for
this

A dangerously empty life  
You always seem to bring the light

And even though we live inside  
A dangerously empty life  
You always seem to bring me light  
You always seem to bring me light

[Verse 1]  
And I know she'll be the death of me  
At least we'll both be numb  
And she'll always get the best of me  
The worst is yet to come  
But at least we'll both be beautiful and stay forever young  
This I know, yeah, this I know  
[Pre-Chorus]  
She told me, "don't worry about it"  
She told me, "don't worry no more"  
We both know we can't go without it  
She told me you'll never be alone, oh, oh, woo  
  
[Chorus]  
I can't feel my face when I'm with you  
But I love it, but I love it, oh  
I can't feel my face when I'm with you  
But I love it, but I love it, oh  
  
[Verse 2]  
And I know she'll be the death of me  
At least we'll both be numb  
And she'll always get the best of me  
The worst is yet to come  
All the misery was necessary when we're deep in love  
This I know, girl, I know  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
She told me, "don't worry about it"  
She told me, "don't worry no more"  
We both know we can't go without it

But I love it, but I love it, oh

[Pre-Chorus]  
She told me, "don't worry about it"  
She told me, "don't worry no more"  
We both know we can't go without it  
She told me you'll never be alone, oh, oh, woo  
  
[Chorus]  
I can't feel my face when I'm with you  
But I love it, but I love it, oh  
I can't feel my face when I'm with you  
But I love it, but I love it, oh  
I can't feel my face when I'm with you  
But I love it, but I love it, oh  
I can't feel my face when I'm with you  
But I love it, but I love it, oh

It won't be in vain  
To swallow all your pain  
And learn to love what burns  
And gather courage to return  
  
Faces in the crowd  
Faces in the crowd will smile again  
And the devil may cry  
The devil may cry at the end of the night  
  
Faces in the crowd  
Faces in the crowd will smile again  
And the devil may cry  
The devil may cry at the end of the night  
  
The light will shine through the rain  
And heaven will hear them call your name  
And home will feel like home again  
Corruption will fill your brain  
  
Faces in the crowd  
Faces in the crowd will smile again  
And the devil may cry  
The devil may cry at the end of the night  
  
Faces in the crowd  
Faces in the crowd will smile again  
And the devil may cry  
The devil may cry at the end of the night  
  
They will parade upon your victory  
They will parade upon your victory  
You'll put a smile upon their faces  
The world will be yours for the taking  
The story you birth will be ageless  
Just learn to love pain and be patient  
  
Faces in the crowd  
Faces in the crowd will smile again  
And the devil may cry  
The devil may cry at the end of the night  
  
Faces in the crowd  
Faces in the crowd will smile again  
And the devil may cry  
The devil may cry at the end of the night

[Hook]  
I'm so used to being used  
So I love when you call unexpected  
Cause I hate when the moment's expected  
So I'ma care for you, you, you  
I'ma care for you, you, you, you, yeah  
Cause girl you're perfect  
You're always worth it  
And you deserve it  
The way you work it  
Cause girl you earned it  
Girl you earned it  
  
You know our love would be tragic  
So you don't pay it, don't pay it no mind  
We live with no lies  
Hey, hey  
You're my favorite kind of night  
  
I'm so used to being used  
So I love when you call unexpected  
Cause I hate when the moment's expected  
So I'ma care for you, you, you  
I'ma care for you, you, you, you, yeah  
Cause girl you're perfect  
You're always worth it  
And you deserve it  
The way you work it  
Cause girl you earned it  
Girl you earned it  
  
On that lonely night  
You said it wouldn't be love  
But we felt the rush  
It made us believe it there was only us  
Convinced we were broken inside, inside  
  
I'm so used to being used  
So I love when you call unexpected  
Cause I hate when the moment's expected  
So I'ma care for you, you, you  
I'ma care for you, you, you, you, yeah  
Cause girl you're perfect  
You're always worth it  
And you deserve it  
The way you work it  
Cause girl you earned it  
Girl you earned it

Oh, oh, oh, oh  
So back, I'm so bad, I'm so bad  
Can I be honest with you please?  
It's really hard for me to speak right now  
Girl, I been drinkin' all day  
It's been a long week  
Can't you tell by my face?  
I wanna lose myself between your legs  
I wanna make your body shake  
Girl, if you drink this fifth, no chase  
I promise you'll have nothing to say  
Cause at least I deserve this no conversation  
I been working all week  
I'd rather be your enemy  
Than any friend you think I would be  
  
[Hook]  
I'm just tryin' take you home without a word  
I'm just trying to kiss your neck without a word  
I'm just trying to lay you down without a word  
I'm just trying to get you high without a word  
I'm just trying to make you numb without a word  
I'm just trying to make you cum without a word  
I'm just trying to make you sleep without a word  
Girl, I'm just trying to let you leave without a word  
  
Please, please, please  
Let me be the enemy  
  
I forgot how it feels to regret my sins  
I need that old thing back baby  
You can help me out baby  
You remind me of a feeling that I used to have  
So I don't know what to expect from you tonight  
But I'm not trying to waste nobody's time  
I'm just trying to find material, some inspiration  
We can put it in a song, if you want  
But at least I deserve is no conversation  
I been working all week  
I'd rather be your enemy  
Than any friend you think I would be  
  
[Hook]  
  
I never fall for a girl like you  
I'll never understand what you're going through  
But your body poppin', your head game too  
You lookin' at my nigga, you can have him too  
Cause baby, I ain't perfect girl, I hope you knew  
There ain't nothin' wrong, you can pick and choose  
Just don't call tomorrow askin' "what did I do?"  
You know what you did, all to blame is you  
Now the least I deserve is no conversation  
I been working all week  
I'd rather be your enemy  
Than any friend you think I would be  
  
[Hook]

I'm paying for all my father's sins  
So I will thank him for you  
I'ma thank him for you  
My serotonin's got a while to go  
Girl, it's gone 'cause of you  
It's been gone 'cause of you  
  
They say, they want heaven  
They say, they want God  
I say, I got heaven  
Well I say, I am God  
  
I never prayed a moment in my life  
Girl I'm rewarded with you  
I've been rewarded with you  
So baby let me kiss your inner thigh  
Let me kiss it for you  
I can kiss it for you  
  
They say, they want heaven  
They say, they want God  
I say, I have heaven  
I say, I am God

You don't know  
What's in store  
But you know what you're here for

[Verse 1]  
And I know she'll be the death of me, at least we'll both be numb  
And she'll always get the best of me, the worst is yet to come  
But at least we'll both be beautiful and stay forever young  
This I know, yeah, this I know  
  
[Bridge]  
She told me, "Don't worry about it"  
She told me, "Don't worry no more"  
We both know we can't go without it

This I know, girl, I know  
  
[Bridge]  
She told me, "Don't worry about it"  
She told me, "Don't worry no more"

[Verse 1]  
All alone she was living  
In a world without an end or beginning  
Babygirl was living life for the feeling  
But I don't mind, I don't mind  
And all the wrongs she committed  
She was numb and she was so co-dependent  
She was young and all she had was the city  
But I don't mind, I don't mind  
  
[Bridge]  
And I know that she's capable of anything, it's riveting  
But when you wake up she's always gone, gone, gone  
  
[Hook]  
In the night she hears him calling  
In the night she's dancing to relieve the pain  
She'll never walk away (I don't think you understand)  
In the night when she comes crawling  
Dollar bills and tears keep falling down her face  
She'll never walk away (I don't think you understand)  
  
[Verse 2]  
He sang a song when he did it  
He was cold and he was so unforgiving  
Now she dances to the song on the minute  
Yeah, all the time, all the time  
It make her weak when she hear it  
And it got her on her knees like religion  
She was young and she was forced to be a woman  
Yeah, all the time, all the time  
  
[Bridge]  
And I know that she's capable of anything, it's riveting  
But when you wake up she's always gone, gone, gone  
  
[Hook]  
In the night she hears him calling  
In the night she's dancing to relieve the pain  
She'll never walk away (I don't think you understand)  
In the night when she comes crawling  
Dollar bills and tears keep falling down her face  
She'll never walk away (I don't think you understand)  
  
I don't think you understand...  
  
[Hook]  
In the night she hears him calling  
In the night she's dancing to relieve the pain  
She'll never walk away (I don't think you understand)  
In the night when she comes crawling  
Dollar bills and tears keep falling down her face  
She'll never walk away (I don't think you understand)

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]  
Only losers go to school

I'm not the type to count on you  
Because stupid's next to "I love you"  
  
[Hook: The Weeknd]

And now that we're all grown up  
Who do we owe it to?  
And now that we've gone this far  
Who do we owe it all to?  
We did it all alone  
Now we're coming for the throne  
We did it all alone  
Now we're coming for the throne  
And now that we all came up  
Do we lose? Do we lose?

I usually love sleeping all alone  
This time around bring your friend with you  
But we ain't really going to sleep at all  
You ain't gonna catch me with them sneak pictures  
In my city I'm a young god  
That pussy kill be so vicious  
My god why she in my pockets  
Get me redder than the devil 'til I go nauseous  
  
[Hook:]  
Ask me if I do this every day, I said "Often"  
Ask how many times she rode the wave, "Not so often"  
Bitches down to do it either way, often  
Baby I can make that pussy rain, often  
Often, often, girl I do this often  
Make that pussy poppin', do it how I want it  
Often, often, girl I do this often  
Make that pussy poppin', do it how I want it  
Often  
  
Infatuated by the fame status  
She wanna ride inside the G-Class Grain, matted  
I come around, she leave that nigga like he ain't matter  
That girl been drinkin' all day, need to change bladder  
She's just happy that the crew's back in town  
She's 'bout to go downtown for a whole hour  
If I had her, you can have her, man it don't matter  
I'm never sour, I'm just smokin' somethin' much louder  
  
Ask me if I do this every day, I said "Often"  
Ask how many times she rode the wave, "Not so often"  
Bitches down to do it either way, often  
Baby I can make that pussy rain, often  
Often, often, girl I do this often  
Make that pussy poppin', do it how I want it

Girl, I'll go again  
  
Ask me if I do this every day, I said "Often"  
Ask how many times she rode the wave, "Not so often"  
Bitches down to do it either way, often

[Verse 1]  
Tell 'em this boy wasn't meant for lovin'  
Tell 'em this heart doesn't stay to one  
I'll be the same, never changed for nothin'  
It's all I know, never learned much more  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Mama called me destructive, oh yeah  
Said it'd ruin me one day, yeah  
Cause every woman that loved me, oh yeah  
I seemed to push them away  
  
[Chorus]  
That's real life, oh oh oh  
Real life, ooh  
Mama talking that real life, oh oh oh  
That real life, real life, real life, real life  
  
[Verse 2]  
I know you don't really understand it  
I'm not allowed to regret my choice  
I heard that love is a risk worth taking  
I wouldn't know, never been that boy  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Mama called me destructive, oh yeah  
Said it ruined me one day, yeah  
Cause every woman that loved me, oh yeah  
I seemed to push them away

That's real life, oh oh oh  
Real life, ooh  
Mama talking that real life, oh oh oh  
That real life, real life, real life, real life  
  
[Bridge]  
Heaven only lets a few in  
It's too late for me to choose it  
Don't waste precious tears on me, I'm not worth the misery  
I'm better off when I'm alone  
  
[Chorus]  
That's real life, oh oh oh  
Real life, ooh  
Mama talking that real life, oh oh oh  
That real life, real life, real life, real life

[Verse 1]  
We are not the same, I am too reckless  
I'm not tryna go in that direction  
These niggas, they been doin' too much flexin'  
And they about to call the wrong attention  
And I don't got no patience, no more testin'  
I do shit how I want, don't need no blessin'  
XO niggas ain't nothin' to mess with  
Nobody stoppin' us, oh no, we destined  
And everybody 'round you is so basic  
I'm never rockin' white, I'm like a racist  
I don't drink my liquor with a chasin'  
That money is the only thing I'm chasin'  
And some dope dimes on some coke lines  
Gimme head all night, cum four times  
Baby girl just wanna smoke a pound  
Do an ounce, get some dick  
Tell her friends about it  
  
[Hook]  
Go tell your friends about it (About it)  
Go tell your friends about it (About it)  
Go tell 'em what you know, what you seen  
How I roll, how I be on the low  
Go tell your friends about it (About it)  
Go tell your friends about it  
I'm that nigga with the hair  
Singin' 'bout poppin' pills, fuckin' bitches, livin' life so trill  
  
[Verse 2]  
Last year I did all the politickin'  
This year Imma focus on the vision  
I think these hoes deserve another fixin'  
I'm talkin' 'bout the ones from the beginnin'  
Don't believe the rumours, bitch, I'm still a user  
I'm still rockin' camo and still roll with shooters  
I'm a villain in my city, I just made another killin'  
Imma spend it all on bitches  
And everybody fuckin', everybody fuckin'  
Pussy on the house, everybody fuckin'  
Man, I miss my city, man, it's been a minute  
MIA a habit, Cali was the mission  
Cruise through the west-end in my new Benz  
I'm just tryna live life through a new lens  
Drivin' by the streets I used to walk through  
When I had no crib, I guess you call that shit a miracle  
  
[Hook]  
Go tell your friends about it (About it)  
Go tell your friends about it (About it)  
Go tell 'em what you know, what you seen  
How I roll, how I be on the low  
Go tell your friends about it (About it)  
Go tell your friends about it  
I'm that nigga with the hair  
Singin' 'bout poppin' pills, fuckin' bitches, livin' life so trill  
  
[Verse 3]  
My cousin said I made it big and it's unusual  
She tried to take a selfie at my Grandma's funeral  
Used to roam on Queen, now I sing Queen street anthems  
Used to hate attention, now I pull up in that wagon  
And I was broken, I was broken, I was so broke  
I used to roam around the town when I was homeless  
Me and Lamar would rob a nigga for his Jordans  
And flip it just to get these hoes another nose fix  
Now we get faded when we want, girl, we got choices  
Lay them on the fuckin' table, we got choices  
And if they wanna fuck my niggas, they got choices  
They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless  
Yeah, that shit is pointless  
They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless  
Yeah, that shit is pointless  
They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless  
  
[Hook]  
Go tell your friends about it (About it)  
Go tell your friends about it (About it)  
Go tell 'em what you know, what you seen  
How I roll, how I be on the low  
Go tell your friends about it (About it)  
Go tell your friends about it  
I'm that nigga with the hair  
Singin' 'bout poppin' pills, fuckin' bitches, livin' life so trill

Can't you see?  
It won't mean a thing to me  
I've been doing this too long  
Baby girl, I've felt it all  
So watch out  
If you try to play your luck  
Ain't nobody gonna care enough  
To catch you fall  
  
[Chorus]  
So don't you fall in love  
Don't make me make you fall in love  
Don't make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me  
Nobody needs to fall in love  
I swear I'm just a bird  
Girl, I'm just another bird  
Don't make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me  
Like me  
  
Girl, you tried  
You tried to warn me  
But baby, I'm warning you  
Girl, I'll show you  
This is no game  
You'll be falling to the point of no return  
No return  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I know you're rolling hard with it, don't lie  
I know it's got a hold of you  
I know you're rolling with it, baby don't you lie  
Baby  
  
I know you're rolling hard with it, don't lie  
I know it's got a hold of you  
I know you're rolling with it, baby don't you lie  
Baby  
  
So don't you fall in love  
Don't make me make you fall in love  
Don't make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me  
Like me  
'Cause girl I'm just a bird  
I'm just another bird  
Don't make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me  
Like me

[Verse 1]  
Your man on the road, he doing promo  
You said keep our business on the low-low  
I'm just tryna get you out the friend-zone  
Cause you look even better than the photos  
I can't find your house, send me the info  
Driving through the gated residential  
Found out I was coming, sent your friends home  
Keep on tryna hide it but your friends know  
  
[Chorus]  
I only call you when it's half past, five  
The only time that I'll be by, your, side

When I'm fucked up, that's the real me  
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah  
I only call you when it's half-past, five  
The only time I'd ever call you mine

I'ma let you know and keep it simple  
Tryna keep it up, don't seem so simple  
I just fucked two bitches 'fore I saw you  
You gon' have to do it at my tempo  
Always tryna send me off to rehab  
Drugs started feelin' like it's decaf  
I'm just tryna live life for the moment  
And all these motherfuckers want a relapse  
  
[Chorus]  
I only call you when it's half past, five  
The only time that I'll be by, your, side

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]  
Remember that time I showed up with just panties under my coat?  
High heels, they was knee high, and my legs was grippin' that throat  
You told me this and I quote, cause we popped pills and you smoked  
You said, "your stuff got me strung out, it's like doin' lines of some coke"  
You always say it's the best that you ever had in your life  
And you always play with it good when we be speedin' off in that Wraith  
Just keep coppin' them things that you be coppin' me on the eighth  
You the president and I'm Biden, just slide in cause you safe, nigga, third
base

So I'ma let you taste her  
I ain't washing my sins

Now we're lying about the nights  
Hiding it all behind the smiles  
Take a look at what you did

But baby it's okay

There comes a time in a man's life  
He must take responsibility  
For the choices he has made  
There are certain things that he must do  
Things that he must say  
  
Like I Love you  
And I need you  
I only want you  
And nobody's goin' to know if it's true  
  
I never thought I'd feel this kind of hesitation (tonight)

I wish I didn't have to lie  
I wish I could let you know  
  
'Cause I love you  
And I need you  
I only want you  
And nobody's going to know if it's true
