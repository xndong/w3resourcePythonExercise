Some days I have to give right in to the blues  
Despite how I try to keep fightin'  
It's a sure shot I'm going to lose  
And I'll tell you why  
You think I'm crazy  
It's such a sad composition  
But can you blame me  
For what's been causing my bad disposition?  
Ain't nothing new with my blue situation  
And nothing's fine, it's just a minor variation  
When troubles want to find me, I ain't hard to find  
They know where I am  
Like a hungry pack of wolves when it's feeding time  
They tear up a man  
And it's a strange thing  
"Cause now it don't really matter  
More of the same thing  
Don't even hurt it's been part of the pattern  
But still in all it's a small consulation  
I just define it as a minor variation  
Ain't now way to fight 'em darling  
Ain't no way around 'em baby  
Ain't now way to take 'em honey  
Nowhere to hide and believe me I've tried to shake 'em  
I'm getting to the point where I don't feel the pain  
And I've had enough  
I'm ready for the next time it hits me again  
"Cause I've gotten tough  
It doesn't faze me  
And now I've made my decision  
I may be crazy  
It's not as though I don't know that condition  
Until I'm through with this blue situation  
Pass me the wine, it's just a minor variation  
Ain't nobody's business, baby  
Ain't nobody's worry darlin'  
Ain't nobody's problem  
No way to win when you've already been forgotten  
And it's a strange thing  
"Cause now it don't really matter  
More of the same thing  
Don't even hurt, it's a part of the pattern  
Until I'm through with this blue situation  
Pass me the wine, it's just a minor variation  

You've got diamonds and I've got spades  
You've got pills  
And I've got razor blades  
You've got yoga honey  
I've got beer  
You got overpriced  
And I got weird  
But it's alright  
We're the same even though we're alone  
It's alright  
Yes we all need a room of our own  
You've got love darlin'  
I've got sex  
You've got cash, mama  
And I've got checks  
You've got business, baby  
I've got the kids  
You got crowded just the way I did  
But it's alright  
Cause we all need a place to call home  
It's alright  
Yes we all need a room of our own  
I can still remember packed together  
Like a can of sardines  
No, no, no  
Pushin', shovin'  
That's when lovin'  
Starts to come apart at the seams  
Oh no, no, no, no  
You've got the day shift  
I've got nights  
We go wrong at times  
But we've got rights  
You've got TV shows  
I've got crime  
But you've got your room, honey  
And I've got mine  
It's alright  
It's the one thing that we should have known  
Yes, it's alright  
Yes, we all need a room of our own  
And it's alright  
Yes we all need a place to call home  
It's alright  
Yes we all need a room of our own  
It's alright  
It's alright  
To have a room of your own  
No, no, no, it's alright  
Yeah it's alright mama  
To have a room of our own  
Sometimes you've got to get away  
Got to get away  
Got to get away  
Got to get away to a room of our own  
Got to have a room  
Got to have a little elbow room of my own.  
  

She waits for me at night, she waits for me in silence  
She gives me all her tenderness and takes away my pain  
And so far she hasn't run, though I swear she's had her moments  
She still believes in miracles while others cry in vain  
  
It's all about soul  
It's all about faith and a deeper devotion  
It's all about soul  
'Cause under the love is a stronger emotion  
She's got to be strong  
'Cause so many things getting out of control  
Should drive her away  
So why does she stay?  
It's all about soul  
  
She turns to me sometimes and asks me what I'm dreaming  
And I realize I must have gone a million miles away  
And I ask her how she knew to reach out for me that moment  
And she smiles because it's understood there are no words to say  
  
It's all about soul  
It's all about knowing what someone is feeling  
The woman's got soul  
The power of love and the power of healing  
This life isn't fair  
It's gonna get dark, it's gonna get cold  
You've got to be tough, but that ain't enough  
It's all about soul  
  
There are people who have lost every trace of human kindness  
There are many who have fallen, there are some who still survive  
She comes to me at night and she tells me her desires  
And she gives me all the love I need to keep my faith alive  
  
It's all about soul  
It's all about joy that comes out of sorrow  
It's all about soul  
Who's standing now and who's standing tomorrow  
You've got to be hard  
Hard as the rock in that old rock 'n' roll  
But that's only part, you know in your heart  
It's all about soul

All my life, I've searched this whole world through  
Try as I might, to find someone like you  
The years drifted by, but it was always on my mind  
I didn't know how long I'd go, until I ran out of time  
  
All my life, I've hurt the ones who cared  
One by one, no loving heart was spared  
I've been a wild and restless man, but still a man who needs a wife  
That was my dream and now it seems you've taken all my life  
  
For as long as I could my intentions were good  
I assumed my affairs would be fine  
But I know very well, there's a long road to hell  
That's been paved with intentions like mine  
  
All my life, I've paid for my mistakes  
After a while, the strongest spirit breaks  
I've had heartache and pain, it cut me deeper than a knife  
But those days are done, 'cause you're the one I've wanted all my life  
  
And I know very well, there's a long road to hell  
That's been paved with intentions like mine  
All my life, my stars were surely crossed  
Now and then, I missed the love I lost  
But all that changed, the day you said you'd be my wife  
  
Who could have known that finding you  
Would only take me all my life

Well, bless my soul, what's wrong with me?  
I'm itching like a man on a fuzzy tree  
My friends say I'm actin' queer as a bug  
I'm in love, I'm all shook up  
Uh huh huh, oh, hey, yeah, yeah  
  
Well, my hands are shaky and my knees are weak  
I can't seem to stand on my own two feet  
Now who do you think of when you have such luck  
I'm in love, I'm all shook up  
Uh huh huh, oh, hey, yeah, yeah  
  
Well, please don't ask what's on my mind  
I'm a little mixed up but I'm feeling fine  
When I'm near the girl that I love best  
My heart beats so that it scares me to death  
  
Well, she touches my hand what a chill I got  
Her kisses are like a volcano that's hot  
I'm proud to say that she's my buttercup  
I'm in love, I'm all shook up  
Uh huh huh, oh, hey, yeah, yeah  
  
Well, my tongue gets tied when I try to speak  
My insides shake like a leaf on a tree  
There's only one cure for this soul of mine  
That's to have that girl that I love so fine  
  
She touches my hand what a chill I got  
Her kisses are like a volcano that's hot  
I'm proud to say that she's my buttercup  
I'm in love, I'm all shook up  
Uh huh huh, oh, hey, yeah, yeah  
Uh huh huh, oh, hey, yeah, yeah  
Uh huh huh, oh, hey, yeah, yeah, I'm all shook up!

Oh baby, you don't get turned on by the radio.  
Oh baby, you got nothing to play on your stereo.  
"Why don't the Beatles get back together?"  
"Why don't nobody sing of romance?"-  
Oh baby, all you wanna do is dance.  
Oh baby, I think you are lost in the seventies.  
Oh baby, "The music she ain't what she used to be."  
You don't understand what they're saying,  
You've given it every chance  
Oh baby, all you wanna do is dance.  
Well you wish you were back in the good old days,  
When tomatoes were cheaper,  
And you never heard the words of your favorite songs  
Through a three inch speaker.  
And you never messed around with dangerous drugs,  
You were all getting sick on beer-  
And you didn't get any (unless you went steady and made out for a year).  
Well you can hide away honey, in your rock and roll dreams,  
You can stand by your blue suede shoes-  
But the party is over,  
And I'm getting tired of waiting for you.  
Oh baby, "Where are the oldies they used to play?"  
Oh baby, you want to crawl back into yesterday,  
You don't want to deal with the future,  
You don't want to make any plans-  
Oh baby, all you wanna do is dance.  

Well we're living here in Allentown  
And they're closing all the factories down  
Out in Bethlehem they're killing time  
Filling out forms  
Standing in line  
Well our fathers fought the Second World War  
Spent their weekends on the Jersey Shore  
Met our mothers in the USO  
Asked them to dance  
Danced with them slow  
And we're living here in Allentown  
But the restlessness was handed down  
And it's getting very hard to stay  
Well we're waiting here in Allentown  
For the Pennsylvania we never found  
For the promises our teachers gave  
If we worked hard  
If we behaved  
So the graduations hang on the wall  
But they never really helped us at all  
No they never taught us what was real  
Iron and coal  
Chromium steel  
And we're waiting here in Allentown  
But they've taken all the coal from the ground  
And the union people crawled away  
Every child has a pretty good shot  
To get at least as far as their old man got  
But something happened on the way to that place  
They threw an American flag in our face  
Well I'm living here in Allentown  
And it's hard to keep a good man down  
But I won't be getting up today  
And we're living here in Allentown

She can kill with a smile, she can wound with her eyes  
She can ruin your faith with her casual lies  
And she only reveals what she wants you to see  
She hides like a child, but she's always a woman to me  
  
She can lead you to love, she can take you or leave you  
She can ask for the truth, but she'll never believe you  
And she'll take what you give her, as long it's free  
Yeah, She steals like a thief, but she's always a woman to me  
  
[Chorus: ]  
Ohhh... she takes care of herself  
She can wait if she wants, she's ahead of her time  
Ohhh... and she never gives out  
And she never gives in, she just changes her mind  
  
And she'll promise you more than the garden of Eden  
Then she'll carelessly cut you and laugh while you're bleeding  
But she'll bring out the best and the worst you can be  
Blame it all on yourself 'cause she's always a woman to me  
  
[Chorus: ]  
  
She's frequently kind and she's suddenly cruel  
She can do as she pleases, she's nobody's fool  
And she can't be convicted, she's earned her degree  
And the most she will do is throw shadows at you  
But she's always a woman to me

Some people stay far away from the door  
If there's a chance of it opening up  
They hear a voice in the hall outside  
And hope that it just passes by  
  
Some people live with the fear of a touch  
And the anger of having been a fool  
They will not listen to anyone  
So nobody tells them a lie  
  
I know you're only protecting yourself  
I know you're thinking of somebody else  
Someone who hurt you  
But I'm not above  
Making up for the love  
You've been denying you could ever feel  
I'm not above doing anything  
To restore your faith if I can  
Some people see through the eyes of the old  
Before they ever get a look at the young  
I'm only willing to hear you cry  
Because I am an innocent man  
I am an innocent man  
Oh yes I am  
  
Some people say they will never believe  
Another promise they hear in the dark  
Because they only remember too well  
They heard somebody tell them before  
  
Some people sleep all alone every night  
Instead of taking a lover to bed  
Some people find that it's easier to hate  
Than to wait anymore  
  
I know you don't want to hear what I say  
I know you're gonna keep turning away  
But I've been there and if I can survive  
I can keep you alive  
I'm not above going through it again  
I've not above being cool for a while  
If you're cruel to me I'll understand  
  
Some people run from a possible fight  
Some people figure they can never win  
And although this is a fight I can lose  
The accused is an innocent man  
I am an innocent man  
Oh yes I am  
An innocent man  
  
You know you only hurt yourself out of spite  
I guess you'd rather be a martyr tonight  
That's your decision  
But I'm not below  
Anybody I know  
If there's a chance of resurrecting a love  
I'm not above going back to the start  
To find out where the heartache began  
  
Some people hope for a miracle cure  
Some people just accept the world as it is  
But I'm not willing to lay down and die  
Because I am an innocent man  
  
I am an innocent man  
Oh yes I am  
An innocent man

In every heart there is a room  
A sanctuary safe and strong  
To heal the wounds from lovers past  
Until a new one comes along  
  
I spoke to you in cautious tones  
You answered me with no pretense  
And still I feel I said too much  
My silence is my self defense  
  
And every time I've held a rose  
It seems I only felt the thorns  
And so it goes, and so it goes  
And so will you soon I suppose  
  
But if my silence made you leave  
Then that would be my worst mistake  
So I will share this room with you  
And you can have this heart to break  
  
And this is why my eyes are closed  
It's just as well for all I've seen  
And so it goes, and so it goes  
And you're the only one who knows  
  
So I would choose to be with you  
That's if the choice were mine to make  
But you can make decisions too  
And you can have this heart to break  
  
And so it goes, and so it goes  
And you're the only one who knows.

Late at night  
When it's dark and cold  
I reach out  
For someone to hold  
When I'm blue  
When I'm lonely  
She comes through  
She's the only one who can  
My baby grand  
Is all I need  
  
In my time  
I've wandered everywhere  
Around this world  
She would always be there  
Any day  
Any hour  
All it takes  
Is the power in my hands  
This baby grand's  
Been good to me  
  
I've had friends  
But they slipped away  
I've had fame  
But it doesn't stay  
I've made fortunes  
Spent them fast enough  
As for woman  
They don't last with just one man  
But baby grand  
Will stand by me  
  
They say that no one's gonna play this on the radio  
They said the melancholy blues were dead and gone  
But only songs like these  
Played in minor keys  
Keep those memories holding on  
  
I've come far  
From the life I've strayed in  
I've got scars  
From those dives I've played in  
Now I'm home  
And I'm weary  
In my bones  
Every dreary one night stand  
But baby grand  
Came home with me  
  
Ever since this gig began  
My baby grand's  
Been good to me

Oh, flew in from Miami Beach B.O.A.C.  
Didn't get to bed last night  
On the way the paper bag was on my knee  
Man I had a dreadful flight  
I'm back in the U.S.S.R.  
You don't know how lucky you are boy  
Back in the U.S.S.R. (Yeah)  
  
Been away so long I hardly knew the place  
Gee it's good to be back home  
Leave it till tomorrow to unpack my case  
Honey disconnect the phone  
I'm back in the U.S.S.R.  
You don't know how lucky you are boy  
Back in the U.S.  
Back in the U.S.  
Back in the U.S.S.R.  
  
Well the Ukraine girls really knock me out  
They leave the West behind  
And Moscow girls make me sing and shout  
That Georgia's always on my mind  
  
Aw come on!  
Ho yeah!  
Ho yeah!  
Ho ho yeah!  
Yeah yeah!  
  
Yeah I'm back in the U.S.S.R.  
You don't know how lucky you are boys  
Back in the U.S.S.R.  
  
Well the Ukraine girls really knock me out  
They leave the West behind  
And Moscow girls make me sing and shout  
That Georgia's always on my mind  
  
Oh, show me around your snow-peaked mountains way down south  
Take me to your daddy's farm  
Let me hear your balalaika's ringing out  
Come and keep your comrade warm  
I'm back in the U.S.S.R.  
Hey you don't know how lucky you are boys  
Back in the U.S.S.R.  
  
Oh let me tell you, honey  
Hey, I'm back!  
I'm back in the U.S.S.R.  
Yes, I'm free!  
Yeah, back in the U.S.S.R.  
  
Ha ha

Why can't I lay low  
Why can't I say what I mean  
Why don't I stay home  
And get myself into some boring routine  
  
Why can't I calm down  
Why is it always a fight  
I can't get unwound  
Why do I throw myself into the night  
  
I'm on the outside  
I don't fit into the groove  
Now I ain't a bad guy  
So tell me what am I trying to prove  
  
Why can't I cool out  
Why don't I button my lip  
Why do I lash out  
Why is it I always shoot from the hip  
  
I cruise from Houston to Canal Street  
A misfit and a rebel  
I see the winos talking to themselves  
And I can understand  
Why is it everytime I go out  
I always seem to get in trouble  
I guess I made an impression on somebody  
North of Hester and south of Grand  
  
And so in my small way  
I'm a big man on Mulberry street  
I don't mean all day  
Only at night when I'm light on my feet  
  
What else have I got  
That I'd be trying to hide  
Maybe a blind spot  
I haven't seen from the sensitive side  
  
But you know in my own heart  
I'm a big man on Mulberry street  
I play the whole part  
I leave a big tip with every receipt  
  
I'm so romantic  
I'm such a passionate man  
Sometimes I panic  
What if nobody finds out who I am

You went uptown riding in your limousine  
In your fine Park Avenue clothes  
You had the Dom Perignon in your hand  
And the spoon up your nose  
And when you wake up in the morning  
With your head on fire  
And your eyes too bloody to see  
Go on and cry in your coffee  
But don't come bitchin' to me  
  
Because you had to be a big shot, didn't you  
You had to open up your mouth  
You had to be a big shot, didn't you  
All your friends were so knocked out  
You had to have the last word, last night  
You know what everything's about  
You had to have a white hot spotlight  
You had to be a big shot last night  
  
They were all impressed with your Halston dress  
And the people that you knew at Elaine's  
And the story of your latest success  
Kept 'em so entertained  
But now you just can't remember  
All the things you said  
And you're not sure you want to know  
I'll give you one hint, honey  
You sure did put on a show  
  
Yes, yes, you had to be a big shot, didn't you  
You had to prove it to the crowd  
You had to be a big shot, didn't you  
All your friends were so knocked out  
You had to have the last word, last night  
You're so much fun to be around  
You had to have the front page, bold type  
You had to be a big shot last night  
  
Well, it's no big sin to stick your two cents in  
If you know when to leave it alone  
But you went over the line  
You couldn't see it was time to go home  
No, no, no, no, no, no, you had to be a big shot, didn't you  
You had to open up your mouth  
You had to be a big shot, didn't you  
All your friends were so knocked out  
You had to have the last word, last night  
So much fun to be around  
You had to have a white hot spotlight  
You had to be a big shot last night

From a town known as Wheeling, West Virginia  
Rode a boy with a six-gun in his hand  
And his daring life of crime  
Made him a legend in his time  
East and West of the Rio Grande  
Well he started with a bank in Colorado  
In the pocket of his vest, a Colt he hid  
And his age and his size took the teller by surprise  
And word spread of Billy the Kid...  
Well he never traveled heavy  
Yes, he always rode alone  
And he soon put many older guns to shame  
And he never had a sweetheart  
And he never had a home  
But the cowboy and the rancher knew his name  
Well he robbed his way from Utah to Oklahoma  
And the law just could not seem to track him down  
And it served his legend well  
For the folks they'd love to tell 'bout when Billy the Kid came to town  
Well one cold day a posse captured Billy  
And the judge said "String him up for what he did!"  
And the cowboys and their kin like the sea came pourin' in  
To watch the hangin' of Billy the Kid  
Well he never traveled heavy  
Yes, he always rode alone  
And he soon put many older guns to shame  
And he never had a sweetheart  
But he finally found a home  
Underneath the Boot Hill grave that bears his name.  
From a town known as Oyster Bay, Long Island  
Rode a boy with a six-pack in his hand  
And his daring life of crime  
Made him a legend in his time  
East and West of the Rio Grande

Saturday night and you're still hangin' around  
Tired of living in your one horse town  
You'd like to find a little hole in the ground  
For a while  
  
So you go to the village in your tie dyed jeans  
And you stare at the junkies and the closet queens  
It's like some pornographic magazine  
And you smile  
  
Captain Jack will get you high tonight  
And take you to your special island  
Captain Jack will get you by tonight  
Just a little push, and you'll be smilin'  
  
Oh yeah  
  
Your sister's gone out, she's on a date  
You just sit at home and masturbate  
Your phone is gonna ring soon, but you just can't wait  
For that call  
  
So you stand on the corner in your New English clothes  
And you look so polished from your hair down to your toes  
Ah but still your fingers gonna pick your nose  
After all,...  
  
Captain Jack will get you high tonight  
And take you to your special island  
Captain Jack will get you by tonight  
Just a little push, and you'll be smilin'  
  
So you decide to take a holiday  
You got your tape deck and your brand new Chevrolet  
Ah, there ain't no place to go anyway  
What for?  
  
So you got everything, ah, but nothing's cool  
They just found your father in the swimming pool  
And you guess you won't be going back to school  
Anymore.  
  
Captain Jack will get you high tonight  
And take you to your special island  
Captain Jack will get you by tonight  
Just a little push, and you'll be smilin'  
  
So you play your albums, and you smoke your pot  
And you meet your girlfriend in the parking lot  
Oh but still you're aching for the things you haven't got  
What went wrong?  
  
And if you can't understand why your world is so dead,  
Why you've got to keep in style and feed your head  
Well you're 21 and still your mother makes your bed,  
And that's too long  
  
Captain Jack will get you high tonight  
And take you to your special island  
Captain Jack will get you by tonight  
Just a little push, and you'll be smilin'  
  
Captain Jack will get you high tonight  
And take you to your special island  
Captain Jack will get you by tonight  
Just a little push, and you'll be smilin'

Well I know you got your troubles  
But I've got problems of my own  
It's all relative you see, what happiness should be  
And we got to work it out alone.  
I know about your situation  
And I know all about your pain  
But you know it's true though it's no comfort to you  
Into each life must fall some rain  
  
We all have our cross to bear.  
We all walk in darkness sometimes.  
Though I know it don't seem fair,  
We all have our cross to bear.  
  
You know I hate to see you cry  
I hate to see you cry now  
Because I had my share of tears  
And though it may sound cool  
You know I'd be a fool to let it slide a few more years.  
Listen, I just got to have my freedom  
And if that's giving you the blues  
That's the price you pay, Lord, there ain't no other way  
But to get down on your knees and pay your dues  
'Cause don't you know...  
  
We all have our cross to bear  
We all knuckle under sometimes  
Oh, everybody gets his share  
We all have our cross to bear  
  
Oh, I just got to have my freedom  
And if that's giving you the blues  
Well, that's the price you pay, Lord,  
There ain't no other way  
But to get down on your knees and pay your dues  
'Cause don't you know...  
  
We all have our cross to bear  
We all walk in darkness sometimes  
Oh, everybody gets his share, mmm,  
''cause we all have our cross to bear

All the waiters in your grand cafe  
Leave their tables when you blink  
Every dog must have his every day  
Every drunk must have his drink  
Don't wait for answers  
Just take your chances  
Don't ask me why  
All your life you had to stand in line  
Still you're standing on your feet  
All your choices made you change your mind  
Now your calendar's complete  
Don't wait for answers  
Just take your chances  
Don't ask me why  
You can say the human heart is only make believe  
And I am only fighting fire with fire  
But you are still a victim  
Of the accidents you leave  
As sure as I'm a victim of desire  
All the servants in your new hotel  
Throw their roses at your feet  
Fool them all but baby I can tell  
You're no stranger to the street  
Don't ask for favors  
Don't talk to strangers  
Don't ask me why  
Yesterday you were an only child  
Now your ghosts have gone away  
You can kill them in the classic style  
Now you "parlez vous francais"  
Don't look for answers  
You took your chances  
Don't ask me why  
Don't ask me why

Well, it's been building up inside of me  
For oh, I don't know how long  
I don't know why but I keep thinking  
Something's bound to go wrong  
She looks in my eyes  
And makes me realize when she says  
  
(Don't worry baby)  
Don't worry baby  
(Don't worry baby)  
Everything will turn out all right  
(Don't worry baby)  
Don't worry baby  
(Don't worry baby)  
  
I guess I should've kept my mouth shut  
When I start to brag about my car  
But I can't back down now  
Because I've pushed the other guys too far  
She makes me come alive  
And makes me wanna drive when she says  
  
(Don't worry baby)  
Don't worry baby  
(Don't worry baby)  
Everything will turn out all right  
(Don't worry baby)  
Don't worry baby  
(Don't worry baby)  
  
She told me, "Baby, when you race today  
Just take along my love with you  
And if you knew how much I love you, baby  
Nothing could go wrong with you"  
Oh, what she does to me  
When she makes love to me and she says  
  
(Don't worry baby)  
Don't worry baby  
(Don't worry baby)  
Everything will turn out all right  
(Don't worry baby)  
Don't worry baby  
  
(Don't worry baby)  
Everything will turn out all right  
(Don't worry baby)  
Don't worry baby  
(Don't worry baby)  
Everything will turn out all right  
(Don't worry baby)  
Don't worry baby  
  
(Don't worry baby)  
Everything will turn out all right  
(Don't worry baby)  
Don't worry baby  
(Don't worry baby)  
Everything will turn out all right  
(Don't worry baby)  
(Don't worry baby)

You don't have to talk all night  
I'm a man who can't say no  
You don't have to twist my arm  
Just point me where you want to go  
Take me to the action  
Take me to the track  
Take me to a party if they're bettin' in the back  
I've been working all my life  
Can't afford to wait  
Let me call my wife so I can tell her I'll be late  
I want the easy  
Easy money  
Easy money  
I could get lucky  
Oh, things could go right  
I want the easy  
Easy money  
Easy money  
Maybe this one time  
Maybe tonight  
You don't have to try too hard  
I don't need a song and dance  
I don't need an invitation  
If you've got a game of chance  
Take me to the tables  
Take me to the fights  
Run me like the numbers  
Roll me like the dice  
When you're counting on a killing  
Always count me in  
Talk me into losin' just as long as I can win  
I want the easy  
Easy money  
Easy money  
I want the good times  
Oh, I never had  
I want the easy  
Easy money  
I want the good life  
I want it bad  
Easy money  
You say I fool myself  
But better me than being a fool for someone else  
I got a hot slot machine of a system  
Ready to go  
Easy money  
I got a one-track mind  
And a good reputation laying on the line  
I'll either come back a bum or a king  
Baby I don't know  
You don't have to start a fight  
I'm a man who can't say no  
If you've got a little risky business  
Just point me where you want to go  
Take me to the power  
Take me to the heat  
Take me to the cleaners  
If it's open to the street  
Something's got to pay off  
Something's got to break  
Someone's got a fortune that they're begging  
Me to take  
I want the easy  
Easy money  
Easy money  
I could get lucky  
Things could go right  
I want the easy  
Easy money  
Easy money  
Maybe just this time  
Oh maybe tonight  
Easy money  
Oh I don't want no hard cash  
I just want the easy money  
I could get lucky  
  

Everything I do  
I'm thinking thoughts of only you, girl  
Everywhere I go  
Dreams of you will always follow  
  
Every step I take, every move I make  
I'm trying to spend my life without you  
I turn, I run, I hide, but I know deep inside  
A part of me has died, yeah, yeah  
  
I closed my eyes and see  
A picture of your face before me  
Upon my lips I feel  
A tender kiss, you're almost real  
  
Every step I take, every move I make  
I'm trying to spend my life without you  
I turn, I run, I hide, but I know deep inside  
A part of me has died, yeah, yeah

While in these days of quiet desperation  
As I wander through the world in which I live  
I search everywhere, for some new inspiration  
But it's more than cold reality can give  
  
If I need a cause for celebration  
Or a comfort I can use to ease my mind  
I rely on my imagination  
And I dream of an imaginary time  
  
[Chorus: ]  
I know that everybody has a dream  
Everybody has a dream  
And this is my dream, my own  
Just to be at home  
And to be all alone...with you  
  
If I believe in all the words I'm saying  
And if a word from you can bring a better day  
Then all I have are these games that I've been playing  
To keep my hope from crumbling away  
  
So let me lie and let me go on sleeping  
And I will lose myself in palaces of sand  
And all the fantasies that I have been keeping  
Will make the empty hours easier to stand  
  
[Chorus: ]  
  
Everybody has a dream... (Repeat)

Sitting here in Avalon, looking at the pouring rain  
Summertime has come and gone and everybody's home again  
  
Closing down for the season, I found the last of the souvenirs  
I can still taste the wedding cake and it's sweet after all these years  
  
These are the last words I have to say  
That's why this took so long to write  
There will be other words some other day  
But that's the story of my life  
  
There's comfort in my coffee cup and apples in the early fall  
They're pulling all the moorings up and gathering at the Legion Hall  
They swept away all the streamers after the Labor Day parade  
Nothing left for a dream now, only one final serenade  
  
And these are the last words I have to say  
Before another age goes by  
With all those other songs I'll have to play  
But that's the story of my life  
  
And it's so clear standing here where I am  
Ain't that what justice is for?  
Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn anymore  
  
Stack the chairs on the table tops  
Hang the sheets on the chandeliers  
It slows down but it never stops  
Ain't it sweet after all these years  
  
And these are the last words I have to say  
It's always hard to say goodbye  
But now it's time to put this book away  
And that's the story of my life  
  
These are the last words I have to say  
That's why this took so long to write  
There will be other words some other day  
Ain't that the story of my life  
  
These are the last words I have to say  
Before another age goes by  
With all those other songs I'll have to play  
Ain't that the story of my life

I went searching for the truth  
But in my innocence I found  
All the con men and their acrobats  
Who stomped me in the ground  
If I count up their percentages  
I know they're getting rich  
But they haven't taken everything  
Those paybacks are a bitch  
Though I've lost quite a lot  
I am still in control  
They can keep what they've got  
But they can't have my soul  
And if I don't have this all worked out  
Still I'm getting closer, getting closer  
I still have far to go no doubt  
But I'm getting closer, getting closer  
What was ripped off by professionals  
Is not all that it seems  
While I must live up to contracts  
I did not give up my dreams  
If I see it as experience  
It hasn't gone to waste  
Lately all the missing pieces  
Have been falling into place  
And if I could go back and start over somehow  
I would not change that much  
Knowing what I know now  
Thought there have been sins  
I will regret  
Still I'm getting close, getting closer  
I don't have all the answers yet  
But I'm getting closer, getting closer  
I'm a mark for every shyster  
From Topanga to Berlin  
And I should have learned to kick them out  
As soon as they crawled in  
So to every bank in Switzerland  
That stores my stolen youth  
I'm alright because despite the laws  
You cannot hide the truth  
And although you will say  
I am still too naive  
But I have not lost faith  
In the things I believe  
And if I don't have this all worked out  
Still I'm getting closer, getting closer  
I still have far to go no doubt  
But I'm still getting closer, getting closer

We met as soulmates  
On Parris Inland  
We left as inmates  
From an asylum  
And we were sharp  
As sharp as knives  
And we were so gung ho to lay down our lives.  
  
We came in spastic  
Like tameless horses  
We left in plastic  
As numbered corpses  
And we learned fast  
To travel light  
Our arms were heavy but our bellies were tight  
  
We had no homefront  
We had no soft soap  
They sent us Playboy  
They gave us Bob Hope  
We dug in deep  
And shot on sight  
And prayed to Jesus Christ with all of our might.  
  
We had no cameras  
To shoot the landscape  
We passed the hash pipe  
And played our Doors tapes  
And it was dark...  
So dark at night  
And we held onto each other  
Like brother to brother  
We promised our mothers we'd write  
  
And we would all go down together  
We said we'd all go down together  
Yes we would all go down together.  
  
Remember Charlie?  
Remember Baker?  
They left their childhood  
On every acre  
And who was wrong,  
And who was right?  
It didn't matter in the thick of the fight  
  
We, held the day  
In the palm of our hands  
They, ruled the night  
And the night, seemed to last as long as six weeks  
On Parris Island  
We held the coastline  
They held the highland  
And they were sharp  
As sharp as knives  
They heard the hum of the motors  
They counted the rotors  
And waited for us to arrive  
  
And we would all go down together  
We said we'd all go down together  
Yes we would all go down together.

Well so here I am at the end of the road  
Where do I go from here?  
I always figured it would be like this  
Still nothing seems to be quite clear  
  
All the words have been spoken and the prophecy fulfilled  
But I just can't decide where to go  
Yes, it's been quite a day and I should go to sleep  
But tomorrow I will wake up and I'll know  
  
That I've got to begin again  
Though I don't know how to start  
Yes, I've got to begin again  
And it's hard  
  
Well it's been quite a while since I lifted my head  
And I'm sure the light will hurt my eyes  
I see the way that I been spendin' my days  
And reality has caught me by surprise  
  
I was dreamin' of tomorrow so I sacrificed today  
And it sure was a grand waste of time  
And despite all the truth that's been thrown in my face  
I just can't get you out of my mind  
  
But I've got to begin again  
Though I don't know how to start  
Yes, I've got to begin again  
And it's hard

Little Geo is a friend of mine  
We get some money and we buy a cheap wine  
Sit on the corner and have a holiday  
Hide the bottle when the cop goes by  
Talk about women and lie, lie, lie  
Oh, my other world is just a half a mile away.  
  
Wait for mama to turn out the light  
Crawl on the roof and then I hit the night  
I should be sleeping tonight but I just can't stay  
I've given everybody so much time  
Now I need a moment that's mine...  
Oh my other world is just a half a mile away  
  
It's just a half a mile away  
  
Angelina save a place for me  
I've been livin' someone else's life and now I've got to be free  
Turn your transistor on and let the music play  
I try to keep the family satisfied  
But there's gotta be more to life than just try, try, try  
Oh my other world is only a half a mile away  
  
It's just a half a mile away

Have yourself  
A merry little Christmas  
Let your heart be light  
From now on  
Our troubles  
Will be out of sight  
  
Have yourself  
A merry little Christmas  
Make the Yule-tide gay  
From now on  
Our troubles  
Will be miles away  
  
Here we are as in olden days  
Happy golden days of yore  
Faithful friends  
Who are dear to us  
Gather near to us once more  
  
Through the years  
We all will be together  
If the Fates allow  
Hang a shining star  
Upon the highest bough  
And have yourself  
A merry little Christmas now

Hey girl! I want you to know,  
I'm gonna miss you so much if you go  
And hey girl! I tell you no lie,  
Something deep inside of me's going to die  
If you must say so long  
If this is good-bye  
  
Oh! Hey girl! This can't be true  
How am I supposed to exist without you  
And, hey girl! Now don't put me on,  
What's gonna happen to me when you're gone  
How will I live,  
How can I go on  
How can I go on  
Hey girl!  
  
Oh! Hey girl! Now sit yourself down,  
I'm not ashamed to get down on the ground  
And then beg you to stay  
Don't go away  
Hey girl!  
Don't go away  
Hey girl!  
Don't go away

If you search for tenderness  
It isn't hard to find.  
You can have the love you need to live.  
But if you look for truthfulness  
You might just as well be blind.  
It always seems to be so hard to give.  
  
Honesty is such a lonely word.  
Everyone is so untrue.  
Honesty is hardly ever heard.  
And mostly what I need from you.  
  
I can always find someone  
To say they sympathize.  
If I wear my heart out on my sleeve.  
But I don't want some pretty face  
To tell me pretty lies.  
All I want is someone to believe.  
  
Honesty is such a lonely word.  
Everyone is so untrue.  
Honesty is hardly ever heard.  
And mostly what I need from you.  
  
I can find a lover.  
I can find a friend.  
I can have security until the bitter end.  
Anyone can comfort me  
With promises again.  
I know, I know.  
  
When I'm deep inside of me  
Don't be too concerned.  
I won't ask for nothin' while I'm gone.  
But when I want sincerity  
Tell me where else can I turn.  
Because you're the one that I depend upon.  
  
Honesty is such a lonely word.  
Everyone is so untrue.  
Honesty is hardly ever heard.  
And mostly what I need from you.

I met a gin soaked barroom queen in Memphis  
She tried to take me upstairs for a ride (yeah)  
She had to heave me right across her shoulder  
Cause I just can't seem to drink you off my mind (no)  
It's the honky tonk women (yeah)  
Give me, give me, give me the honky tonk blues  
Strollin' on the boulevards of Paris  
As naked as the day that I will die  
The sailors they're so charming there in Paris  
But they just don't seem to sail you off my mind (yeah)  
It's the honky tonk women  
Give me, give me, give me the honky tonk blues  
(Yeah)  
It's the honky tonk women, yeah  
And give me, give me, give me the honky tonk blues (my my)  
It's the honky tonk women, yeah  
And give me, give me, give me the honky tonk blues

She said she'd meet me in the bar  
At the Plaza hotel  
Wear a jacket and a tie  
What's the occasion  
She just smiled and she wouldn't say why  
So here I am standing waiting in the lobby  
Sweating bullets in this stupid old suit  
And when she sees me, she busts out laughing  
You're a sad sight honey but you look so cute, and  
  
(CHORUS):  
I don't want to be alone anymore  
I was checking you out  
I was just making sure  
No, I don't want to be alone anymore  
And I want you tonight  
Although you hurt me before  
It didn't matter that I felt like a fool  
'Cause I forgot when she walked through the door  
I said I'm sorry but she said it was cool  
And I don't want to be alone anymore  
  
It's so confusing choosing sides  
In the heat of the moment  
Just to see if it's real  
It's so erotic having you  
Tell me how it should feel  
But I'm avoiding all the hard cold facts  
That I've got to face  
So ask me just one question  
When this magic night is through  
Could it have been just anyone  
Or did it have to be you  
And will you still be saying  
  
(CHORUS)  
  
But don't you know that it's wrong  
It's wrong, it's wrong  
But like the song  
Being caught by the wink of an eye  
I can't be sure we'll get along  
But I'm willing to try  
As long as you can tell me  
  
(CHORUS)

Call me a joker, call me a fool  
Right at this moment I'm totally cool  
Clear as a crystal, sharp as a knife  
I feel like I'm in the prime of my life  
Sometimes it feels like I'm going too fast  
I don't know how long this feeling will last  
Maybe it's only tonight  
  
Darling I don't know why I got to extremes  
Too high or too low there ain't no in-betweens  
And if I stand or I fall  
It's all or nothing at all  
Darling I don't know why I got to extremes  
  
Sometimes I'm tired, sometimes I'm shot  
Sometimes I don't know how much more I've got  
Maybe I'm headed over the hill  
Maybe I've set myself up for the kill  
Tell me how much do you think you can take  
Until the heart in you is starting to break?  
Sometimes it feels like it will  
  
Darling I don't know why I go to extremes  
Too high or too low there ain't no in-betweens  
You can be sure when I'm gone  
I won't be out there too long  
Darling I don't know why I got to extremes  
  
Out of the darkness, into the light  
Leaving the scene of the crime  
Either I'm wrong or I'm perfectly right every time  
Sometimes I lie awake, night after night  
Coming apart at the seams  
Eager to please, ready to fight  
Why do I go to extremes?  
  
And if I stand or I fall  
It's all or nothing at all  
  
Darling I don't know why I go to extremes  
Too high or too low there ain't no in-betweens  
And if I stand of I fall  
It's all or nothing at all  
Darling I don't know why I go to extremes  
  
No I don't know why I go to extremes  
Too high or too low there ain't no in-betweens  
You can be sure when I'm gone  
I won't be out there too long  
Darling I don't know why I go to extremes

If I only had the words to tell you  
If you only had the time to understand  
Though I know it wouldn't change your feelings  
And I know you'll carry on the best you can.  
  
If I only had the urge to tell you  
If you only knew how hard it is to say  
When the simple lines have all been taken  
And the radio repeats them ev'ry day.  
  
If I never find the song to sing you  
If you always find it hard to comprehend  
Well, you know there wouldn't be much meaning  
If I had to sing those tired words again.  
  
Life goes on and on  
And tonight will soon be gone  
But if we try we can be sure.  
  
If I only had the words to tell you  
If you only had the time to understand  
But I only have these arms to hold you  
And it's all that you can ask of any man.  
  
La la la la, la la la la  
  
If I only had the words to tell you  
If you only had the time to understand  
Oh, but I only have these arms to hold you  
And it's all that you can ask of any man.

One, two, a-one two three four  
  
I've got every reason on earth to be mad, 'cause I just lost the only girl I
had  
If I could get my way, I'd get myself locked up today, but I can't, so I'll
cry instead  
  
I've got a chp on my shoulder that's bigger that my feet  
I can't talk to people that I feet  
If I could see you now, I'd try to make you sad somehow, but I can't, so I'll
cry instead  
  
Don't want to cry when there's people there, I get shy when they start to
stare  
I'm gonna hide myself away, hey, but I'll be back again someday  
  
And when I do, you'd better hide all the girls  
'Cause I'll be breaking hearts all around the world  
Yes, I'm gonna break them in two and show you what your loving man can do  
Until then, I'll cry instead  
  
Oh I don't want to cry when there's people there, I get shy when they start to
stare  
I'm gonna hide myself away, hey, but I'll be back again someday  
  
And when I do, you'd better hide all the girls  
'Cause I'll be breaking hearts all around the world  
Yes, I'm gonna break them in two and show you what your loving man can do  
Until then, I'll cry instead... Until then, I'll cry instead... Until then,
I'll cry instead...  
  
(Thank you very much. Thank you all.)

In a sentimental mood, I can see the stars come thru my room  
While your loving attitude, is like a flame that lights the gloom  
  
On the wings of every kiss, drifts a melody so strange and sweet  
In this sentimental bliss, you make my paradise complete  
  
Rose petals seem to fall, it's all I could dream to call you mine  
My heart's a lighter thing, since U made this night a thing divine  
  
In a sentimental mood, I'm within a world so heavenly  
For I never dreamt that you'd be loving sentimental me  
  
In a sentimental mood, I'm within a world so heavenly  
For I never dreamt that you'd be loving sentimental me

Now we take our time  
So nonchalant  
And spend our nights  
So Bon vivant  
We dress our days  
In silken robes  
The money comes  
The money goes  
We know it's all a passing phase,  
  
We light our lamps  
For atmosphere  
And hang our hopes  
On chandeliers  
We're going wrong  
We're gaining weight  
We're sleeping long  
And far too late  
And so it's time  
To change our ways  
But I've loved these days.  
  
Now as we indulge  
In things refined  
We hide our hearts  
From harder times  
A string of pearls  
A foreign car  
Oh we can only go so far  
On caviar and Cabernet.  
  
We drown our doubts  
In dry champagne  
And soothe our souls  
With fine cocaine  
I don't know why I even care  
We'll get so high  
And get nowhere  
We'll have to change our jaded ways,  
But I've loved these days.  
  
So before we end  
And then begin  
We'll drink a toast to how it's been  
A few more hours to be complete  
A few more nights on satin sheets  
A few more times that I can say,  
I've loved these days.

James, we were always friends  
From our childhood days  
And we made our plans  
And we had to go our separate ways.  
I went on the road  
You pursued an education.  
  
James, do you like your life?  
Can you find release?  
Will you ever change?  
Will you ever write your masterpiece?  
Are you still in school  
Living up to expectations? James  
  
You were so relied upon  
Everybody knows how hard you tried.  
Hey, look at what a job you've done  
Carrying the weight of family pride.  
  
James, you've been well behaved,  
You've been working hard  
But will you always stay  
Someone else's dream of who you are?  
Do what's good for you, or you're not good for anybody, James.  
  
I went on the road,  
You pursued an education, James  
  
How you gonna know for sure?  
Everything was so well organized.  
Hey, now everything is so secure  
And everybody else is satisfied.  
  
James, do you like your life?  
Can you find release?  
Will you ever change?  
When will you write your masterpiece?  
Do what's good for you, or you're not good for anybody, James.

When I wake up in the mornin' light  
I pull on my jeans and I feel all right  
I pull my blue jeans on, I pull my old blue jeans on (ch-ch)  
I pull my blue jeans on, I pull my old blue jeans on (ch-ch)  
  
It's the weekend, and I know that you're free  
So pull on your jeans and come on out with me  
I need to have you near me, I need to feel you close to me (ch-ch)  
I need to have you near me, I need to feel you close to me  
  
You and me, we'll go motorbike ridin' in the sun and the wind and the rain  
I got money in my pocket, got a tiger in my tank  
And I'm king of the road again  
  
I'll meet ya in the usual place  
I don't need a thing, 'cept your pretty face  
And I need to have you near me, I need to feel you close to me (ch-ch)  
I need to have you near me, I need to feel you close to me (ch-ch)  
I need to have you near me, I need to feel you close to me (ch-ch)  
  
You and me, we'll go motorbike ridin' in the sun and the wind and the rain  
I got money in my pocket, a tiger in my tank  
And I'm king of the road again  
  
When I wake up in the mornin' light  
I pull on my jeans and I feel all right  
I pull my blue jeans on, I pull my old blue jeans on (ch-ch)  
I pull my blue jeans on, I pull my old blue jeans on (ch-ch)  
I pull my blue jeans on, I pull my old blue jeans on (ch-ch)

Didn't cha know what I mean  
When I said 'I love you Josephine'? Yeah  
Josephine.  
Nothing I say does justice to you  
Or lights up the day the way that you do  
Josephine.  
  
Like a beautiful queen  
You deserve a crown  
My Josephine. Yeah  
Josephine.  
Well I pick up the phone and give you a call  
You come around with your sneakers and all  
Josephine.  
  
Well  
Sit right back. Suppose I went away. Ah  
Honey.  
Would your love turn sour and moldy green?  
When I take from you the light of yoodle-eh-hi-hoo  
Would I make you sad  
My Josephine?  
  
You arrived on the scene  
You made me glad I'm alive  
My Josephine. Yeah  
Josephine.Well  
Nothing I say does justice to you  
Lights up the day the way that you do  
Josephine.

Well if money makes a rich man  
Then I might never make the grade  
I'll be a small time operator  
If I just get the landlord paid  
But if time is an indication  
Of the wealth that I never knew  
Then I'm the last of the big time spenders  
'Cause I've been spending time on you, woo oo oo woo  
It takes time to appreciate  
Lord knows that you can learn to hate it  
I believe, 'cause I've been there too  
When it gets down to desperation  
You make the best of the situation  
I can tell, I've seen it through, oh, oh, oh  
Though it seems like the day is wasted  
And the nights have been overdue  
Well, I'm the last of the big time spenders  
And I've been spendin' time on you, woo oo oo woo  
It's been so long since we got together  
In between it seems to take forever  
But I'm a dreamer, I'll be there soon  
It takes time to appreciate  
All of those that you can learn to hate  
I believe, I've seen it through, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
You can call me the Great Pretender  
And in a way it might be true  
But I'm the last of the big time spenders  
And I've been spendin' time on you, woo oo oo woo  

Laura  
Calls me  
In the middle of the night  
Passes on her  
Painful information  
Then these careless fingers  
They get caught in her vice  
Til they're bleeding  
On my coffee table  
Living alone isn't all that  
It's cracked up to be  
I'm on her side  
Why does she push the poison on me?  
Laura  
Has a very hard time  
All her life has  
Been one long disaster  
Then she tells me  
She suddenly believes she's seen  
A very good sign  
She'll be taking  
Some aggressive action  
I fight her wars  
While she's slamming her doors  
In my face  
Failure to break  
Was the only mistake  
That she made  
Here I am  
Feeling like a fucking fool  
Do I react the way exactly  
She intends me to?  
Everytime I think I'm off the hook  
She makes me lose my cool  
I'm her machine  
And she can punch all the keys  
She can push any button I was programmed through  
Laura  
Calls me  
When she needs a good fix  
All her questions  
Will get sympathetic answers  
I should  
Be so  
Immunized  
To all of her tricks  
She's surviving  
On her second chances  
Sometimes I feel like this  
Godfather deal is all wrong  
How can she hold an umbilical chord  
For so long?  
I've done everything I can  
What else am I supposed to do  
I'm her machine  
And she can punch all the keys  
She can push any button I was programmed through  
Laura  
Loves me  
Even if I don't care  
That's my problem  
That's her sacred absolution  
If she had to  
She would put herself in my chair  
Even though I  
Faced electrocution  
She always says  
I'm the best friend that  
She's ever had  
How do you  
Hang up on someone  
Who needs you that bad?  
  

Victor was born  
The spring of '44  
And never saw  
His father anymore  
A child of sacrifice  
A child of war  
Another son who never had  
A father after Leningrad  
Went off to school  
And learned to serve the state  
Follow the rules  
And drank his vodka straight  
The only way to live  
Was drown the hate  
The Russian life was very sad  
And such was life in Leningrad  
  
I was born in '49  
A Cold War kid in McCarthy time  
Stop 'em at the 38th parallel  
Blast those yellow reds to hell  
Cold war kids were hard to kill  
Under their desks in an air raid drill  
Haven't they heard we won the war  
What do they keep on fighting for?  
  
Victor was sent  
To some Red Army town  
Served out his time  
Become a circus clown  
The greatest happiness  
He'd ever found  
Was making Russian children glad  
And children lived in Leningrad.  
  
The children lived in Levittown  
Hid in the shelters underground  
Til the Soviets turned their ships around  
And tore the Cuban missiles down  
And in that bright October sun  
We knew our childhood days were done  
I watched my friends go off to war  
What do they keep on fighting for?  
  
So my child and I came to this place  
To meet him, eye to eye and face to face  
He made my daughter laugh  
Then we embraced  
We never knew what friends we had  
Until we came to Leningrad.

She stands before you naked  
You can see it, you can taste it  
But she comes to you  
Light as the breeze  
You can drink or you can nurse it  
It don't matter how you worship  
As long as you're  
Down on your knees  
  
So I knelt there at the delta  
At the alpha and the omega  
At the cradle of the river  
And the seas  
And like a blessing come from heaven,  
For something like a second,  
I was healed, and my heart  
Was at ease  
  
O baby I waited  
So long for your kiss  
For something to happen  
Oh, something like this  
  
And you're weak and you're harmless  
And you're sleeping in your harness  
And the wind's going wild  
In the trees  
And it's not exactly prison  
But you'll never be forgiven  
For whatever you've done  
With the keys  
  
O baby I waited  
So long for your kiss  
For something to happen  
Oh, something like this  
  
It's dark and it's snowing  
Oh my love I must be going  
The river is starting to freeze  
And I'm sick of pretending  
I'm broken from bending  
I've lived too long  
On my knees  
  
And she dances so graceful  
And your heart's hard and hateful  
And she's naked  
But that's just a tease  
And you turn in disgust  
From your hatred and from your love  
And she comes to you  
Light as the breeze  
  
O baby I waited  
So long for your kiss  
For something to happen  
Oh, something like this  
  
There's blood on every bracelet  
You can see it, you can taste it  
And it's please baby  
Please baby please  
And she says, drink deeply, pilgrim  
But don't forget there's still a woman  
Beneath this  
Resplendent chemise  
  
So I knelt there at the delta  
At the alpha and omega  
I knelt there  
Like one who believes  
And like a blessing come from heaven  
For something like a second  
I was cured, and my heart  
Was at ease  
  
O baby I waited  
So long for your kiss  
For something to happen  
Oh, something like this

Los Angelenos  
All come from somewhere  
To live in sunshine  
Their funky exile  
Midwestern ladies  
High-heeled and faded  
Drivin' sleek new sports cars  
With their New York cowboys  
  
Hiding up in the mountains  
Laying low in the canyons  
Goin' nowhere on the streets  
With their Spanish names  
Makin' love with the natives  
In their Hollywood places  
Making up for all the time gone by  
  
Los Angelenos  
All come from somewhere  
'Cause it's all so easy  
To become acquainted  
Electric babies  
Blue-jeaned and jaded  
Such hot sweet schoolgirls  
So educated  
  
Tanning out in the beaches  
With their Mexican reefers  
No one ever has to feel  
Like a refugee  
Going into garages  
For exotic massages  
Making up for all the time gone by  
  
Hiding up in the mountains  
Laying low in the canyons  
Goin' nowhere on the streets  
With the Spanish names  
Makin' love with the natives  
In their Hollywood places  
Making up for all the time gone by  
Los Angelenos  
All come from somewhere  
It's so familiar  
Their foreign faces

Goodnight, my angel  
Time to close your eyes  
And save these questions for another day  
I think I know what you've been asking me  
I think you know what I've been trying to say  
I promised I would never leave you  
And you should always know  
Wherever you may go  
No matter where you are  
I never will be far away  
  
Goodnight, my angel  
Now it's time to sleep  
And still so many things I want to say  
Remember all the songs you sang for me  
When we went sailing on an emerald bay  
And like a boat out on the ocean  
I'm rocking you to sleep  
The water's dark  
And deep inside this ancient heart  
You'll always be a part of me  
  
Goodnight, my angel  
Now it's time to dream  
And dream how wonderful your life will be  
Someday your child may cry  
And if you sing this lullabye  
Then in your heart  
There will always be a part of me  
  
Someday we'll all be gone  
But lullabyes go on and on...  
They never die  
That's how you  
And I  
Will be

Seen the lights go out Broadway  
I saw the Empire State laid low  
And life went on beyond the Palisades  
They all bought Cadillacs  
And left there long ago  
  
They held a concert out in Brooklyn  
To watch the island bridges blow  
They turned our power down  
And drove us underground  
But we went right on with the show  
  
I've seen the lights go out on Broadway  
I saw the ruins at my feet  
You know we almost didn't notice it  
We'd seen it all the time on 42nd Street  
  
They burned the churches down in Harlem  
Like in that Spanish civil war  
The flames were everywhere  
But no one really cared  
It always burned up there before  
  
I've seen the lights go out on Broadway  
I saw the mighty skyline fall  
The boats were waiting at the Battery  
The union went on strike  
They never sailed at all  
  
They sent a carrier out from Norfolk  
And picked the Yankees up for free  
They said that Queens could stay  
They blew the Bronx away  
And sank Manhattan out at sea  
  
You know those lights were bright on Broadway  
That was so many years ago  
Before we all lived here in Florida  
Before the Mafia took over Mexico  
There are not many who remember  
They say a handful still survive  
To tell the world about  
The way the lights went out  
And keep the memory alive

One-two-three-four  
  
Money or love, which one are you doing it for?  
Everybody has to make that choice sometime, you know  
Something is wrong, I can tell the feeling is gone  
Do you still remember when we started long ago?  
Wasn't it love that kept us all driving in a rented car?  
Who could've known that endless road would ever have come this far?  
  
Money or love, it's your decision where to draw the line  
Everybody has a soul they can control or compromise  
When did you to start putting a price upon the pain in your heart?  
When did I become the reason for the sadness in your eyes?  
You could've asked me anytime, I would've told you why  
Maybe I might I would change your mind, but now it's too late to try...  
  
Goodbye...  
  
Every night I ask myself, could I have been closer to you, when you needed
someone else  
Could a friend who really knew you try... Help you decide  
  
Money or love, tell me what ya gonna do with your life?  
Everybody needs a passion or they cash in while they can  
Make up your mind, before you realize you've run out of time  
You need to reason why, you've got to touch the fire to make your stand  
You could've asked me anytime I would've told you why  
Maybe I might have changed your mind, but now it's too late to try.  
  
Goodbye...  
  
Money or love  
  
Wasn't is love that kept us all driving in a rented car?  
Who could've known that endless road  
Would ever have come this far?  
  
Was it money or love?  
  
Money or love...  
  
Was it money or love... Money or love...  
Money or love... Money or love... Money or love...  
Was it money or love... Was it money or love... Was it love...?

If someone stood up in a crowd  
And raised his voice up way out loud  
And waved his arm  
And shook his leg  
You'd notice him  
  
If someone in a movie show  
Yelled "fire in the second row,  
This whole place is a powder keg! "  
You'd notice him  
  
And even without clucking like a hen  
Everyone gets noticed, now and then,  
Unless, of course, that personage should  
Be  
Invisible, inconsequential me!  
  
Cellophane  
Mister cellophane  
Should have been my name  
Mister cellophane  
'cause you can look right through me  
Walk right by me  
And never know I'm there!  
  
I tell ya  
Cellophane  
Mister cellophane  
Should have been my name  
Mister cellophane  
'cause you can look right through me  
Walk right by me  
And never know I'm there. ..  
  
Suppose you was a little cat  
Residin' in a person's flat  
Who fed you fish and scratched your  
Ears?  
You'd notice him  
  
Suppoose you was a woman wed  
And sleepin' in a double bed beside one man for seven years  
You'd notice him  
  
A human being's made of more than air  
With all that bulk, you're bound to see  
Him there  
  
Unless that human bein' next to you  
Is unimpressive, undistinguished  
You know who. ..  
  
Should have been my name  
Mister cellophane  
'cause you can look right through me  
Walk right by me  
And never know I'm there  
I tell ya  
Cellophane  
Mister cellophane  
Should I bend my name  
Mister cellophane  
'cause you can look right through me  
Walk right by me  
And never know I'm there  
Never even know I'm there

(Originally recorded 1965)  
  
  
Well I climb the highest mountain, and I swim the deepest sea  
If I knew you were riding at my journey's end and waiting for me  
And I'll be there, I know that you'll love me  
I know whatever that you'll say, and I know any way  
If I knew you were waiting there at my journey's end  
  
Somehow it makes fine ways 'til the end of the earth  
But it really doesn't matter what I say, I'll come back someday  
  
Now I know someone who's telling and I said now that it makes  
If I knew you were there at my journey's end  
To be mine for the rest of my day but now it really doesn't matter  
Now I really if I may say 'cause I go anywhere  
If I knew you were waiting there at my journey's end  
Whoa oh oh, at my journey's end...Oh oh oh oh, at...my...jour-ney's...end...

Got a call from an old friend we'd used to be real close  
Said he couldn't go on the American way  
Closed the shop, sold the house, bought a ticket to the west coast  
Now he gives them a stand-up routine in L.A.  
  
I don't need you to worry for me cause I'm alright  
I don't want you to tell me it's time to come home  
I don't care what you say anymore this is my life  
Go ahead with your own life leave me alone  
  
I never said you had to offer me a second chance  
I never said I was a victim of circumstance  
I still belong  
Don't get me wrong  
And you can speak your mind  
But not on my time  
  
They will tell you you can't sleep alone in a strange place  
Then they'll tell you can't sleep with somebody else  
Ah but sooner or later you sleep in your own space  
Either way it's O.K. you wake up with yourself

Some folks like to get away,  
Take a holiday from the neighborhood.  
Hop a flight to Miami Beach or to Hollywood.  
But I'm takin' a Greyhound on the Hudson River line.  
I'm in a New York state of mind.  
  
I've seen all the movie stars in their fancy cars and their limousines.  
Been high in the Rockies under the evergreens.  
I know what I'm needin', and I don't want to waste more time.  
I'm in a New York state of mind.  
  
It was so easy livin' day by day  
Out of touch with the rhythym and blues  
But now I need a little give and take  
The New York Times, the Daily News.  
  
It comes down to reality, and it's fine with me cause I've let it slide.  
I don't care if it's Chinatown or on Riverside.  
I don't have any reasons.  
I left them all behind.  
I'm in a New York state of mind.  
Oh yeah.  
  
It was so easy living day by day  
Out of touch with the rhythym and blues  
But now I need a little give and take  
The New York Times, the Daily News.  
Who, oh, oh whoa who.  
  
It comes down to reality, and it's fine with me cause I've let it slide.  
I don't care if it's Chinatown or on Riverside.  
I don't have any reasons.  
I left them all behind.  
I'm in a New York state of mind.  
  
I'm just taking a Greyhound on the Hudson River line.  
Cause I'm in a, I'm in a New York state of mind.

I've seen those big machines come rolling through the quiet pines  
Blue suits and bankers with their Volvos and their valentines  
Give us this day our daily discount outlet merchandise  
Raise up a multiplex and we will make a sacrifice  
Now we're gonna get the big business  
Now we're gonna get the real thing  
Everybody's all excited about it  
Who remembers when it all began  
Out here in no man's land  
Before they passed the master plan  
Out here in no man's land  
Low supply and high demand  
Here in no man's land  
There ain't much work out here in our consumer power base  
No major industry, just miles and miles of parking space  
This morning's paper says our neighbor's in a cocaine bust  
Lots more to read about Lolita and suburban lust  
Now we're gonna get the whole story  
Now we're gonna be in prime time  
Everybody's all excited about it  
Who remembers when it all began  
Out here in no man's land  
We've just begun to understand  
Out here in no man's land  
Low supply and high demand  
Here in no man's land  
I see these children with their boredom and their vacant stares  
God help us all if we're to blame for their unanswered prayers  
They roll the sidewalks up at night, this place goes underground  
Thanks to the condo kings there's cable now in Zombietown  
Now we're gonna get the closed circuit  
Now we're gonna get the Top 40  
Now we're gonna get the sports franchise  
Now we're gonna get the major attractions  
Who remembers when it all began  
Out here in no man's land  
Before the whole world was in our hands  
Out here in no man's land  
Before the banners and the marching bands  
Out here in no man's land  
Low supply and high demand  
Here in no man's land

I got a friend that nobody knows, nobody knows but me  
I got a friend that nobody knows, nobody knows but me  
Ooh, mama please don't tell it to myself again  
I know she thinks I've fought up my mind  
But I'm a-really telling to my secret for real, but we get along just so fine  
  
I got a friend that nobody hears, nobody hears but me  
I got a friend that nobody hears, nobody hears but me  
Oh I always wanna sleep while my daddy says, I'll kiss him when I turn out the
light  
But my friend is sitting on the edge of the day, turns from the evening into
night  
  
But everybody says he took a stage on him and everybody says I'm just a kid  
Faith in the tunnel took the places on him  
Well looky-looky-looky, well my fingers are ditty-ditty-ditty  
Wop-bop-bop-a-lup-bop-a-lop-bam-boom  
  
Well I got a friend that nobody sees, nobody sees but me  
I got a friend that nobody sees, nobody sees but me, that's right now...  
I got a friend that nobody knows, nobody knows but me  
I got a friend that nobody knows, nobody hears, nobody sees  
Nobody's spoken to me, nobody cares, knows but me...

Nocturne was released as an instrumental piece. However, there were lyrics  
Written for it. These are those lyrics.  
  
When it rains  
I watch the window  
Golden dreams  
Wash down the willow  
Where are my Mardi Gras memories?  
Under silver seas  
  
Long cold nights  
Change my reflection  
Unsung songs  
Show my direction  
Where are my make believe victories?  
Under silver seas  
  
Ships pass over my head  
Purple and blue, yellow and red  
White sails catching the breeze  
Sailing on silver seas  
  
Once I lived  
You might remember  
Born in May  
Died in September  
Where are my carousel fantasies?  
Under silver seas

Come out Virginia, don't let me wait  
You Catholic girls start much too late  
Aw but sooner or later it comes down to faith  
Oh I might as well be the one  
  
Well, they showed you a statue, told you to pray  
They built you a temple and locked you away  
Aw, but they never told you the price that you pay  
For things that you might have done  
Only the good die young  
That's what I said  
Only the good die young  
Only the good die young  
  
You might have heard I run with a dangerous crowd  
We ain't too pretty we ain't too proud  
We might be laughing a bit too loud  
Aw but that never hurt no one  
  
So come on Virginia show me a sign  
Send up a signal, I'll throw you a line  
The stained-glass curtain you're hiding behind  
(You know)  
Never lets in the sun  
Darlin' only the good die young  
Woah  
I tell ya  
Only the good die young  
Only the good die young  
  
You got a nice white dress and a party on your confirmation  
You got a brand new soul  
Mmm, and a cross of gold  
But Virginia they didn't give you quite enough information  
You didn't count on me  
When you were counting on your rosary  
(Oh woah woah)  
  
They say there's a heaven for those who will wait  
Some say it's better but I say it ain't  
I'd rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints  
The sinners are much more fun  
You know that only the good die young  
That's what I said  
I tell ya  
Only the good die young  
Only the good die young  
  
Well your mother told you all that I could give you was a reputation  
Aw she never cared for me  
But did she ever say a prayer for me? oh woah woah  
  
Come out come out come out Virginia don't let 'em wait,  
You Catholic girls start much too late  
Oh sooner or later it comes down to faith  
Oh I might as well be the one,  
You know that only the good die young  
  
I'm telling you baby  
You know that only the good die young  
Only the good die young  
Only the good  
Only the good die young  
Only the good  
Only the good die young

It's nine o'clock on a Saturday  
The regular crowd shuffles in  
There's an old man sitting next to me  
Makin' love to his tonic and gin  
  
He says, "Son, can you play me a memory  
I'm not really sure how it goes  
But it's sad and it's sweet and I knew it complete  
When I wore a younger man's clothes."  
  
La la la, di da da  
La la, di da da da dum  
  
Sing us a song, you're the piano man  
Sing us a song tonight  
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody  
And you've got us feelin' alright  
  
Now John at the bar is a friend of mine  
He gets me my drinks for free  
And he's quick with a joke or to light up your smoke  
But there's someplace that he'd rather be  
He says, "Bill, I believe this is killing me."  
As the smile ran away from his face  
"Well I'm sure that I could be a movie star  
If I could get out of this place"  
  
Oh, la la la, di da da  
La la, di da da da dum  
  
Now Paul is a real estate novelist  
Who never had time for a wife  
And he's talkin' with Davy, who's still in the Navy  
And probably will be for life  
  
And the waitress is practicing politics  
As the businessmen slowly get stoned  
Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness  
But it's better than drinkin' alone  
  
Sing us a song you're the piano man  
Sing us a song tonight  
Well we're all in the mood for a melody  
And you got us feeling alright  
  
It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday  
And the manager gives me a smile  
'Cause he knows that it's me they've been comin' to see  
To forget about life for a while  
And the piano, it sounds like a carnival  
And the microphone smells like a beer  
And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar  
And say, "Man, what are you doin' here?"  
  
Oh, la la la, di da da  
La la, di da da da dum  
  
Sing us a song you're the piano man  
Sing us a song tonight  
Well we're all in the mood for a melody  
And you got us feeling alright

You have to learn to pace yourself  
Pressure  
You're just like everybody else  
Pressure  
You've only had to run so far  
So good  
But you will come to a place  
Where the only thing you feel  
Are loaded guns in your face  
And you'll have to deal with  
Pressure  
You used to call me paranoid  
Pressure  
But even you can not avoid  
Pressure  
You turned the tap dance into your crusade  
Now here you are with your faith  
And your Peter Pan advice  
You have no scars on your face  
And you cannot handle pressure  
All grown up and no place to go  
Psych 1, Psych 2  
What do you know?  
All your life is Channel 13  
Sesame Street  
What does it mean?  
Pressure  
Pressure  
Don't ask for help  
You're all alone  
Pressure  
You'll have to answer  
To your own  
Pressure  
I'm sure you'll have some cosmic rationale  
But here you are in the ninth  
Two men out and three men on  
Nowhere to look but inside  
Where we all respond to  
Pressure  
Pressure  
All your life is Time magazine  
I read it too  
What does it mean?  
Pressure  
I'm sure you'll have some cosmic rationale  
But here you are with your faith  
And your Peter Pan advice  
You have no scars on your face  
And you cannot handle pressure  
Pressure, pressure  
One, two, three, four  
Pressure

In the middle of the night  
I go walking in my sleep  
From the mountains of faith  
To a river so deep  
  
I must be looking for something  
Something sacred I lost  
But the river is wide  
And it's too hard to cross  
  
And even though I know the river is wide  
I walk down every evening and I stand on the shore  
And try to cross to the opposite side  
So I can finally find what I've been looking for  
  
In the middle of the night  
I go walking in my sleep  
Through the valley of fear  
To a river so deep  
  
And I've been searching for something  
Taken out of my soul  
Something I'd never lose  
Something somebody stole  
  
I don't know why I go walking at night  
But now I'm tired and I don't want to walk anymore  
I hope it doesn't take the rest of my life  
Until I find what it is that I've been looking for  
  
In the middle of the night  
I go walking in my sleep  
Through the jungle of doubt  
To a river so deep  
  
I know I'm searching for something  
Something so undefined  
That it can only be seen  
By the eyes of the blind  
  
In the middle of the night  
  
I'm not sure about a life after this  
God knows I've never been a spiritual man  
Baptized by the fire, I wade into the river  
That runs to the promised land  
  
In the middle of the night  
I go walking in my sleep  
Through the desert of truth  
To the river so deep  
  
We all end in the ocean  
We all start in the streams  
We're all carried along  
By the river of dreams  
  
In the middle of the night

There's colors on the street  
Red, white and blue  
People shufflin' their feet  
People sleepin' in their shoes  
But there's a warming sign on the road ahead  
There's lot of people sayin' we'd better off dead  
Don't feel like satan, but I am to them  
So I try to forget it, any way I can.  
  
Keep on rockin' in the free world  
Keep on rockin' in the free world  
Keep on rockin' in the free world  
Keep on rockin' in the free world  
  
I see a woman in the night  
With a baby in her hand  
Under an old street light  
Near a garbage can  
Now she puts the kid away, and she's gone to get a hit  
He hates her life and what she's done to it  
There's one more kid that will never go to school  
Never get to fall in love, never get to be cool  
  
Keep on rockin' in the free world  
Keep on rockin' in the free world  
Keep on rockin' in the free world  
Keep on rockin' in the free world  
  
We got a thousand points of light  
For the homeless man  
We got a kinder, gentler,  
Machine gun hand  
We got department stores and toilet paper  
Got styrofoam boxes for the ozone layer  
Got a man of the people, says keep hope alive  
Got fuel to burn, got roads to drive  
  
Keep on rockin' in the free world  
Keep on rockin' in the free world  
Keep on rockin' in the free world  
Keep on rockin' in the free world

I play nights in the Spanish part of town  
I've got music in my hands  
The work is hard to find  
But that don't get me down  
Rosalinda understands  
  
Crazy Latin dancing solo down in Herald Square  
Oh Havana I've been searching for you everywhere  
And though I'll never be there  
I know what I would see there  
I can always find my Cuban skies  
In Rosalinda's eyes  
  
When she smiles she gives everything to me  
When she's all alone she cries  
And I'd do anything to take away her tears  
Because they're Rosalinda's eyes  
  
Senorita don't be lonely, I will soon be there  
Oh Havana I've been searching for you everywhere  
I've got a chance to make it  
It's time for me to take it  
I'll return before the fire dies  
In Rosalinda's eyes  
  
All alone in a Puerto Rican band  
Union wages, wedding clothes  
Hardly anyone has seen how good I am  
But Rosalinda says she knows  
  
Crazy Latin dancing solo down in Herald Square  
Oh Havana I've been searching for you everywhere  
And though I'll never be there  
I know what I would see there  
I can always find my Cuban skies  
In Rosalinda's eyes

There's a lot of tension in this town  
I know it's building up inside of me  
I've got all the symptoms and the side effects  
Of city life anxiety  
I could never understand why the urban attitude  
Is so superior  
In a world of high rise ambition  
Most people's motives are ulterior  
Sometimes I feel as though I'm running on ice  
Paying the price too long  
Kind of get the feeling that I'm running on ice  
Where did my life go wrong  
I'm a cosmopolitan sophisticate  
Of culture and intelligence  
The culmination of technology  
And civilized experience  
But I'm carrying the weight of all the useless junk  
A modern man accumulates  
I'm a statistic in a system  
That a civil servant dominates  
And all that means is that I'm running on ice  
Caught in the vise so strong  
I'm slipping and sliding, cause I'm running on ice  
Where did my life go wrong  
You've got to run  
You've got to run  
As fast as I can climb  
A new disaster every time I turn around  
As soon as I get one fire put out  
There's another building burning down  
They say this highway's going my way  
But I don't know where it's taking me  
It's a bad waste, a sad case, a rat race  
It's breaking me  
I get no traction cause I'm running on ice  
It's taking me twice as long  
I get a bad reaction cause I'm running on ice  
Where did my life go wrong  
You've got to run  
You've got to run  
Running on ice  
Running on ice  
Running on ice  
Running on ice  
  

Bobby's driving through the city tonight  
Through the lights  
In a hot new rent-a-car.  
He joins the lovers in his heavy machine  
It's a scene down on Sunset Boulevard.  
  
[Chorus]  
Say goodbye to Hollywood  
Say goodbye my baby.  
Say goodbye to Hollywood,  
Say goodbye my baby.  
  
Johnny's taking care of things for a while  
And his style is so right for troubadours.  
They got him sitting with his back to the door  
Now he won't be my fast gun anymore.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Moving on is a chance that you take every time you try to stay together.  
Say a word out of line and you find that the friends you had are gone  
Forever, forever.  
So many faces in and out of my life,  
Some will last, some will just be now and then.  
Life is a series of hellos and goodbyes  
I'm afraid it's time for goodbye again.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Moving on is a chance that you take every time you try to stay together.  
Say a word out of line and you find that the friends you had are gone  
Forever, forever.  
So many faces in and out of my life,  
Some will last, some will just be now and then.  
Life is a series of hellos and goodbyes  
I'm afraid it's time for goodbye again.

A bottle of white, a bottle of red  
Perhaps a bottle of rose instead  
We'll get a table near the street  
In our old familiar place  
You and I,face to face  
  
A bottle of red, a bottle of white  
It all depends upon your appetite  
I'll meet you any time you want  
In our Italian Restaurant.  
  
Things are okay with me these days  
Got a good job, got a good office  
Got a new wife, got a new life  
And the family's fine  
We lost touch long ago  
You lost weight I did not know  
You could ever look so good after  
So much time.  
  
I remember those days hanging out  
At the village green  
Engineer boots, leather jackets  
And tight blue jeans  
Drop a dime in the box play the  
Song about New Orleans  
Cold beer, hot lights  
My sweet romantic teenage nights  
  
Brenda and Eddie were the  
Popular steadys  
And the king and the queen  
Of the prom  
Riding around with the car top  
Down and the radio on.  
Nobody looked any finer  
Or was more of a hit at the  
Parkway Diner  
We never knew we could want more  
Than that out of life  
Surely Brenda and Eddie would  
Always know how to survive.  
  
Brenda and Eddy were still going  
Steady in the summer of '75  
When they decided the marriage would  
Be at the end of July  
Everyone said they were crazy  
"Brenda you know you're much too lazy  
Eddie could never afford to live that  
Kind of life."  
But there we were wavin' Brenda and  
Eddie goodbye.  
  
They got an apartment with deep  
Pile carpet  
And a couple of paintings from Sears  
A big waterbed that they bought  
With the bread  
They had saved for a couple  
Of years  
They started to fight when the  
Money got tight  
And they just didn't count on  
The tears.  
  
They lived for a while in a  
Very nice style  
But it's always the same in the end  
They got a divorce as a matter  
Of course  
And they parted the closest  
Of friends  
Then the king and the queen went  
Back to the green  
But you can never go back  
There again.  
  
Brenda and Eddie had had it  
Already by the summer of '75  
From the high to the low to  
The end of the show  
For the rest of their lives  
They couldn't go back to  
The greasers  
The best they could do was  
Pick up the pieces  
We always knew they would both  
Find a way to get by  
That's all I heard about  
Brenda and Eddie  
Can't tell you more than I  
Told you already  
And here we are wavin' Brenda  
And Eddie goodbye.  
  
A bottle of red, a bottle of white  
Whatever kind of mood you're in tonight  
I'll meet you anytime you want  
In our Italian Restaurant.

Ba ba baduwa Ba ba Baduwa Ba ba Baduwa Taa!  
Ba ba baduwa Ba ba Baduwa Ba ba Baduwa Taa!  
  
Some things were perfectly clear, seen with the vision of youth  
No doubts and nothing to fear, I claimed the corner on truth  
These days it's harder to say I know what I'm fighting for  
My faith is falling away  
I'm not that sure anymore  
  
Shades of grey wherever I go  
The more I find out the less that I know  
Black and white is how it should be  
But shades of grey are the colors I see  
  
Ba ba baduwa Ba ba Baduwa Ba ba Baduwa Taa!  
Ba ba baduwa Ba ba Baduwa Ba ba Baduwa Taa!  
  
Once there were trenches and walls and one point of every view  
Fight 'til the other man falls  
Kill him before he kills you  
These days the edges are blurred, I'm old and tired of war  
I hear the other man's words  
I'm not that sure anymore  
  
Shades of grey are all that I find  
When I look to the enemy line  
Black and white was so easy for me  
But shades of grey are the colors I see  
  
Ba ba baduwa Ba ba Baduwa Ba ba Baduwa Taa!  
Ba ba baduwa Ba ba Baduwa Ba ba Baduwa Taa!  
  
Now with the wisdom of years I try to reason things out  
And the only people I fear are those who never have doubts  
Save us all from arrogant men, and all the causes they're for  
I won't be righteous again  
I'm not that sure anymore  
  
Shades of grey are all that I find  
When I look to the enemy line  
There ain't no rainbows shining on me  
Shades of grey are the colors I see  
  
Shades of grey wherever I go  
The more I find out the less that I know  
There ain't no rainbows shining on me  
Shades of grey are the colors I see  
  
(guitar solo)  
  
Ba ba baduwa Ba ba Baduwa Ba ba Baduwa Taa!  
Ba ba baduwa Ba ba Baduwa Ba ba Baduwa Taa!  

Well I'm shameless when it comes to loving you  
I'd do anything you want me to  
I'd do anything at all  
  
And I'm standing here for all the world to see  
There ain't that much left of me  
That has very far to fall  
  
You know I'm not a man who has ever been  
Insecure about the world I've been living in  
I don't break easy, I have my pride  
But if you need to be satisfied  
  
I'm shameless, baby I don't have a prayer  
Anytime I see you standing there  
I go down upon my knees  
  
And I'm changing, I swore I'd never compromise  
But you convinced me otherwise  
I'll do anything you please  
  
You see in all my life I've never found  
What I couldn't resist, what I couldn't turn down  
I could walk away from anyone I ever knew  
But I can't walk away from you  
  
I have never let anything have this much  
Control over me  
Cause I worked too hard to call my life my own  
Yes I made myself a world  
And it worked so perfectly  
But it's your world now, I can't refuse  
I never had so much to lose  
I'm shameless, shameless  
  
You know it should be easy for a man who's strong  
To say he's sorry or admit when he's wrong  
I've never lost anything I ever missed  
But I've never been in love like this  
  
It's out of my hands  
  
I'm shameless, I don't have the power now  
But I don't want it anyhow  
So I've got to let it go  
  
I'm shameless, shameless as a man can be  
You can make a total fool of me  
I just wanted you to know  
  
I am shameless  
Shameless  
Shameless

She's got a way about her  
I don't know what it is  
But I know that I can't live without her  
She's got a way of pleasin'  
I don't know what it is  
But there doesn't have to be a reason  
Anyway  
  
She's got a smile that heals me  
I don't know why it is  
But I have to laugh when she reveals me  
She's got a way of talkin'  
I don't know what it is  
But it lifts me up when we are walkin'  
Anywhere  
  
She comes to me when I'm feelin' down  
Inspires me without a sound  
She touches me and I get turned around  
She's got a way of showin'  
How I make her feel  
And I find the strength to keep on goin'  
She's got a light around her  
And everywhere she goes  
A million dreams of love surround her  
Everywhere  
  
She comes to me when I'm feelin' down  
Inspires me without a sound  
She touches me and I get turned around  
She's got a smile that heals me  
I don't know why it is  
But I have to laugh when she reveals me  
She's got a way about her  
I don't know what it is  
But I know that I can't live without her  
Anyway

Turn on all the Christmas lights  
Cause baby's coming home tonight  
I can hear her footsteps in the street  
Turn the choral music higher  
Pile more wood upon the fire  
That should make the atmosphere complete  
I've had to wait forever  
But better late than never  
She's just in time for me  
She's right on time  
She's right where she should be  
She's right on time  
I'm a man with so much tension  
Far too many sins to mention  
She don't have to take it anymore  
But since she said she's coming home  
I've torn out all my telephones  
Soon she will be walking through that door  
I may be going nowhere  
But I don't mind if she's there  
She's just in time for me  
She's right on time  
She's right where she should be  
She's right on time  
Left to my own device  
I can always make believe  
That there's nothing wrong  
Still I will chose to live  
In the complicated world  
That we shared for so long  
Good or bad  
Right or wrong  
And it occurred to me  
While I set up my Christmas tree  
She never missed a cue  
Or lost a beat  
Everytime I lost the meter  
There she was when I would need her  
Greeting me with footsteps in the street  
I guess I should have known it  
She'd find the perfect moment  
She's just in time for me  
She's right on time  
She's right where she should be  
She's right on time  
Turn the choral music higher  
Pile more wood upon the fire  
That will make the atmosphere complete  
I've had to wait forever  
But better late than never  
She's just in time for me  
She's right on time  
She's right where she should be  
She's right on time  
She's right on time  
She's right on time  
  

[Chorus:Repeat x2]  
Shout  
Shout  
Let it all out  
These are the things I can do without  
Come on  
I'm talking to you  
Come on  
  
In violent times  
You shouldn't have to sell your soul  
In black and white  
They really really ought to know  
Those one track minds  
That took you for a working boy  
Kiss them goodbye  
You shouldn't have to jump for joy  
You shouldn't have to shout for joy  
  
[Chorus]  
  
They gave you life  
And in return you gave them hell  
As cold as ice  
I hope we live to tell the tale  
I hope we live to tell the tale  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]  
  
And when you've taken down your guard  
If I could change your mind  
I'd really love to break your heart  
I'd really love to break your heart  
  
[Chorus]

I've been watching you waltz all night Diane  
Nobody's found a way behind your defenses  
They never notice the zap gun in your hand  
Until you're pointing it and stunning their senses  
  
All night long, all night long  
You'll shoot 'em down because you're waiting for somebody good to come on  
All night long, all night long  
But you're sleeping with the television on  
  
You say you're looking for someone solid here  
You can't be bothered with those 'just for the night' boys  
Tonight unless you take some kind of chances dear  
Tomorrow morning you'll wake up with a white noise  
  
All night long, all night long  
You're only standing there 'cause somebody once did somebody wrong  
All night long, all night long  
But you'll be sleeping with the television on  
  
You're eyes are saying talk to me, talk to me  
But your attitude is "don't waste my time"  
Your eyes are saying talk to me, talk to me  
But you won't hear a word 'cause it just might be the same old line  
  
This isn't really easy for me to say Diane  
I know you don't need anybody's protection  
I really wish I was less of a thinking man  
And more a fool who's not afraid of rejection  
  
All night long, all night long  
I'll just be standing here 'cause I know I don't have the guts to come on  
All night long, all night long  
And I'll be sleeping with the television on  
  
You're eyes are saying talk to me, talk to me  
But my attitude is "boy, don't waste my time"  
Your eyes are saying talk to me, talk to me  
But I won't say a word 'cause it just might be somebody else's same old line  
  
All night long, all night long  
We're only standing here 'cause somebody might do somebody wrong  
All night long, all night long  
And we'll be sleeping with the television on  
Sleeping with the television on  
Sleeping with the television on

I didn't want to do it but I got too lonely  
I had to call you up in the middle of the night  
I know it's awful hard to try to make love long distance  
But I really needed stimulation  
Though it was only my imagination  
  
It's just a fantasy  
It's not the real thing  
It's just a fantasy  
It's not the real thing  
But sometimes a fantasy  
Is all you need  
  
When am I gonna take control get a hold of my emotions  
Why does it only seem to hit me in the middle of the night  
You told me there's a number I can always dial for assistance  
I don't want to deal with outside action  
Only you can give me satisfaction  
  
It's just a fantasy  
It's not the real thing  
It's just a fantasy  
It's not the real thing  
But sometimes a fantasy  
Is all you need  
  
Sure it would be better if I had you here to hold me  
Be better baby but believe me it's the next best thing  
I'm sure there's many times you've wanted me to hear your secrets  
Don't be afraid to say the words that move me  
Anytime you want to tell them to me  
  
It's just a fantasy  
It's not the real thing  
It's just a fantasy  
It's not the real thing  
But sometimes a fantasy  
Is all you need  
It's just a fantasy  
It's not the real thing  
It's just a fantasy  
It's not the real thing

Sometimes i wish  
  
I know that this question raises all kinds of issues  
in my mind, and this question is do you believe  
in Christ? Because i believe that what we expierence  
and ah and its not being talked about openly enough  
was pure evil.  
  
Sometimes i wish this world was just a crazy  
dream, sometimes things arent what they are meant  
to be, or what they seem.  
  
Sometimes i wish this world was one big dream  
so many tragedies, life threatning disease in  
reality who can we blame for these things? So  
we pray for the families and the souls of the  
people shot dead they cry, roaming through the  
halls of the schools at night. My homie  
Joseph in Texas, 14 years old police took his  
life at his front door. Maybe humans have  
converted into a beast. Can we really point  
the finger at just one thing? Is it a sign  
of the time or just the beginning i pray  
to God to help me keep living. Jealousy  
and envy and so much hate, newborn babies  
thrown in garbage cans every day.  
In the lobby of a hospital a young girl dies, no  
money to pay so she pays with her life.  
  
Chorus  
  
How many times must we ask ourselves why,  
and how many times must we watch our children die?  
Remember the times we were united as one growing  
up as a child life was always fun. Time have  
changed and its been for the worst. Trials and  
tribulations that we face of course, time to put  
our foot down lets get to know our young ones  
before the next tragedy becomes the realest one.  
1999 this year is half was over. Lessons not learned,  
how your learning i couldve told ya. Maybe this  
happened for a reason only the Lord knows why. And  
this is for us to open up our eyes cause death awaits  
us at any given time. My love goes out to those  
whos souls rest tonight, and all we can do is just  
ask ourselves why? Wish this wouldnt be all we can  
do is pray and cry.  
  
Chorus  
  
Things change for the wrong we cant go on this long.  
Hand in hand right by your side, i love it then  
and no more cry so if i was to go to tonight, ill  
pray that youll be alright. One Lord one might rejoice,  
one soul unite one voice.  
  
Pray for all of us, Father let us not take  
things for granted, and please let us count  
each and every one of our blessings Father.  
  
Now generation X is what they call it whys that?  
Is it because this is where it all ends at, to  
go to war we dont need to be over seas. Its been  
declared out in the streets, gangs, thugs,  
moving drugs, government officials, blackmarket,  
military guns.  
Is this why you gave us the right to bare arms? To  
hit armagedon head on? Read between the lines its  
Genesise, and now the youth just dont smoke weed,  
they got things like man made methaphetamines  
never letting the young souls dream. And whats  
to do? When our youth is being mentally,  
physically, sexually abused. How do we change  
when its all put in our brains, money, sex,  
power, the year 2K. And everyday i watch  
the news it shows me how  
close we are to Judgement day, and  
so for its all worth i Pray.  
  
Chorus

Well, it's a rainy night in Paris,  
And I'm sitting by the Seine,  
It's a pleasure to be soaking in the European rain,  
Now my belly's full of fancy food and wine  
Oh but in the morning there'll be hell to pay  
Somewhere along the line  
In the morning there'll be hell hell to pay  
Somewhere along the line  
  
Sweet Virginia cigarette burin' in my hand  
Well you used to be a friend of mine but now I understand  
You've been eating up inside me for some time  
Oh and I know you're gonna get me  
Somewhere along the line  
Well I know you're gonna get me  
Somewhere along the line  
Somewhere along the line  
Well I know it's just a matter of time  
Well the fun falls through and the rent comes due  
Somewhere along the line  
  
Well you know I love my woman,  
And I would not let her down,  
And I did my share of lovin' when I used to get around  
Now I'm satisfied,  
And she is lookin' fine  
Oh but you pay for your satisfaction  
Somewhere along the line  
But you pay for your satisfaction  
Somewhere along the line  
  
Hey it's good to be a young man  
And to live the way you please  
Yes a young man is the king of ev'ry kingdom that he sees  
But there's an old and feeble man not far behind  
Oh that surely will catch up to him  
Somewhere along the line  
That surely will catch up to him  
Somewhere along the line

There you go, slipping away into a state of grace  
I know the look that comes across your face  
It's so familiar to me  
Here I am, trying to keep you in my line of sight  
I'm never certain that you read me right  
Sometimes you don't want to see me  
  
Here we are, both of us know we're in love  
But that isn't always enough  
I never could rise above it all, down I fall  
  
But darling there you go, slipping away into a state of grace  
Granted, this world is not a perfect place  
Still it's the world that I'm in  
Here I am talking while  
You don't hear a word I say  
Knowing you're watching me from far away  
Somewhere that I've never been  
  
Don't you see, you lived a different life than me  
It don't mean you have to be afraid of how  
We're not the same, don't leave me now  
  
But darling there you go, slipping away  
  
How can I get you to stay where you are  
Keep you from going too far  
Holding you here is so hard to do  
I'm losing you  
  
And darling there you go, slipping away into a state of grace  
Drifting away into your sacred place  
Someplace that I've never been  
There you go, slipping away, slipping away into a state of grace  
There you go, slipping away into a state of grace  
Yeah, drifting away into that sacred place  
  
There you go, slipping away

She cuts you once, she cuts you twice  
But still you believe  
The wound is so fresh you can taste the blood  
BUt you don't have strength to leave  
You've been bought, you've been sold  
You've been locked outside the door  
But you stand there pleadin',  
With your insides bleedin',  
'Cause you deep down want some more  
Then she says she wants forgiveness  
It's such a clever masquerade  
She's so good with her stiletto  
You don't even see the blade  
  
She cuts you hard, she cuts you deep,  
She's got so much skill  
She's so fascinating that you're still there waiting  
When she comes back for the kill  
You've been slashed in the face  
You've been left there to bleed  
You want to run away  
But you know you're gonna stay  
'Cause she gives you what you need  
Then she says she wants affection  
While she searches for the vein  
She's so good with her stiletto  
You don't really mind the pain  
  
She cuts you out, she cuts you down  
She carves up your life  
But you won't do nothng  
As she keeps on cutting  
'Cause you know you love the knife  
You've been bought, you've been sold  
You've been locked outside the door  
But you stand there pleadin'  
With your insides bleedin'  
'Cause you deep down want some more  
Then she says she needs affection  
While she searches for the vein  
She's so good with her stiletto,  
You don't really mind the pain

He always found it hard to take her  
She wouldn't listen to advice  
And though he never tried to make her  
She often thought it would be nice  
  
Oh, and now she's headin' out to California  
It's been a long time comin' but she's feeling like a woman tonight  
And she left a little letter said she's gonna make a stop in Nevada  
Goodbye, goodbye.  
  
She tried for years to be a good wife  
It never quite got off the ground  
And all those stories of the good life  
Convinced her not to hang around  
  
Oh, and now she's heading out to California  
And she doesn't know what's comin' but she's sure of what she's leaving behind  
And she left a little letter said she's gonna make a stop in Nevada  
Goodbye, goodbye.  
  
And though she finds it hard to leave him  
She knows it would be worse to stay  
He wouldn't understand the reasons  
That make a woman run away  
  
Oh, and now she's heading out to California  
With some money in her pocket she's a rocket on the fourth of July  
And she left a little letter said she's gonna make a stop in Nevada  
Goodbye, goodbye.  
  
Oh, and now she's heading out to California  
With some money in her pocket she's a rocket on the fourth of July  
And she left a little letter said she's gonna make a stop in Nevada  
Goodbye, goodbye.

Don't get excited  
Don't say a word  
Nobody noticed  
Nothing was heard  
It was committed discreetly  
It was handled so neatly  
And it shouldn't surprise you at all  
You know  
Break all the records  
Burn the cassettes  
I'd be lying if I told you  
That I had no regrets  
There were so many mistakes  
And what a difference it makes  
But still it shouldn't surprise you at all  
You know  
I said it shouldn't surprise you at all  
You know  
Don't look now but you have changed  
Your best friends wouldn't tell you  
Now it's apparent  
Now it's a fact  
So marshal your forces  
For another attack  
You were so young and naive  
I know it's hard to believe  
But now it shouldn't surprise you at all  
You know  
No it shouldn't surprise you at all  
You know  
What has it cost you  
What have you won  
The sins of the fathers  
Are the sins of the sons  
It was always within you  
It will always continue  
But it shouldn't surprise you at all  
You know  
I said it shouldn't surprise you at all  
You know  
  

Listen boy  
Don't want to see you let a good thing  
Slip away  
  
You know I don't like watching  
Anybody make the same mistakes  
I made  
  
She's a real nice girl  
And she's always there for you  
But a nice girl wouldn't tell you what you should do  
  
Listen boy  
I'm sure that you think you got it all  
Under control  
  
You don't want somebody telling you  
The way to stay in someone's soul  
  
You're a big boy now  
You'll never let her go  
But that's just the kind of thing  
She ought to know  
  
Tell her about it  
Tell her everything you feel  
Give her every reason to accept  
That you're for real  
  
Tell her about it  
Tell her all your crazy dreams  
Let her know you need her  
Let her know how much she means  
  
Listen boy  
It's not automatically a certain guarantee  
To insure yourself  
You've got to provide communication constantly  
  
When you love someone  
You're always insecure  
And there's only one good way  
To reassure  
  
Tell her about it  
Let her know how much you care  
When she can't be with you  
Tell her you wish you were there  
  
Tell her about it  
Every day before you leave  
Pay her some attention  
Give her something to believe  
  
Cause now and then  
She'll get to worrying  
Just because you haven't spoken  
For so long  
Though you may not have done anything  
Will that be a consolation when she's gone  
  
Listen boy  
It's good information from a man  
Who's made mistakes  
  
Just a word or two that she gets from you  
Could be the difference that it makes  
  
She's a trusting soul  
She's put her trust in you  
But a girl like that won't tell you  
What you should do  
  
Tell her about it  
Tell her everything you feel  
Give her every reason  
To accept that you're for real  
  
Tell her about it  
Tell her all your crazy dreams  
Let her know you need her  
Let her know how much she means  
  
Tell her about it  
Tell her how you feel right now  
Tell her about it  
The girl don't want to wait too long  
You got to tell her about it  
Tell her now and you won't go wrong  
You got to tell her about it  
Before it gets too late  
You got to tell her about it  
You know the girl don't want  
To wait--you got to  
Tell her about it

It's time for me to be on my way I know  
I've got business to conduct  
And I've got places to go  
But I can't help looking at her sleeping instead  
Another morning I'll have trouble climbing out of this bed  
Because - she's such a temptation  
It's driving me crazy  
And it's my fascination  
That's making me act this way  
And I know what all my friends say  
They're afraid that I'm losing my touch  
But she's such a temptation  
  
I look so tired cause I don't get much sleep  
And I've got too many commitments that are too hard to keep  
And I try to be rational  
And I try to be wise  
But it all gets blown to pieces  
When I look in her eyes  
Because - She's such a temptation  
And nothing can save me  
  
And my only salvation  
Is tearing myself away  
And I know what all of my friends say  
There's a danger in wanting too much  
But she's such a temptation  
  
I should be leaving  
But I can't cut loose  
I have my reasons for resistance  
But I have no excuse  
And I lose my composure  
I could use some restraint  
I never claimed to be a hero  
And I never said I was a saint  
She's such a temptation  
It's driving me crazy  
And it's my fascination  
That's making me act this way  
And I can just hear all my friends say  
"Better watch out, you're losing your touch"  
But she's such a temptation  
  
Yes she is  
She's such a temptation  
Yes she is  
Yes she is  
She's such a temptation

Some people think  
That she's one of those mink-coated ladies  
They say she wakes up at one  
And makes the paparazzi run till dawn  
She wines and dines with Argentines and Kuwaitis  
After she sips margaritas on the White House lawn  
  
That's not her style I can tell you  
That ain't my woman  
It's just not her style I can tell you  
Because I'm her man  
  
The papers say  
She was seen in L.A. with a stranger  
She found a perfect body  
With a Maserati right outside  
  
And then she chartered a Lear  
When she heard her career was in danger  
And gave the pilot  
Somethin' extra for a perfect ride  
  
That's not her style I can tell you  
That ain't my woman  
It's just not her style I can tell you  
Because I'm her man  
  
Not that she's never d  
One something crazy or done something wild  
It's just that she's better  
At doing whatever suits her style  
And that's not her style  
  
I've read where it's said  
That she sleeps in a bed made of satin  
She's had her face done in every place you can try  
They say she gets a piece  
  
Of every lease in Manhattan  
And says she's thirty  
When she's really pushing forty-five  
  
That's not her style I can tell you  
That ain't my woman  
It's just not her style I can tell you  
Because I'm her man

Well I'm on the Downeaster "Alexa"  
And I'm cruising through Block Island Sound,  
I have charted a course to the Vineyard  
But tonight I am Nantucket bound.  
We took on diesel back in Montauk yesterday  
Left this morning from the bell in Gardiners Bay,  
Like all the locals here I had to sell my home  
Too proud to leave I worked my fingers to the bone.  
So I could own my Downeaster "Alexa"  
And I go where the ocean is deep  
There are giants out there in the canyon  
And a good captain can't fall asleep.  
I got bills to pay and children who need clothes  
I know there's fish out there but God only knows,  
They say these waters aren't what they used to be  
But I got people back on land who count on me.  
So if you see my Downeaster "Alexa"  
And if you work with the rod and the reel,  
Tell my wife I am trolling Atlantis  
And I still have my hands on the wheel.  
Now I drive my Downeaster "Alexa"  
More and more miles from shore every year  
Since they told me I can't sell no stripers  
And there's no luck in swordfishing here  
I was a bayman like my father was before  
Can't make a living as a bayman anymore,  
There ain't much future for a man who works the sea  
But there ain't no island left for islanders like me.  

I am the entertainer  
And I know just where I stand  
Another serenader  
And another long-haired band  
Today I am your champion  
I may have won your hearts  
But I know the game, you'll forget my name  
And I won't be here in another year  
If I don't stay on the charts  
  
I am the entertainer  
I'm dressed in the style  
I wear all kinds of sparkles  
I flash the crowd my smile  
But when the night is over  
And I stand without my clothes  
Perspiration stains and varicose veins  
My eyes look shot  
My belly's got a pot  
And there's a pimple on my nose  
  
I am the entertainer  
Been all around the world  
I've played all kinds of palaces  
And laid all kinds of girls  
I can't remember faces  
I don't remember names  
Ah, but what the hell  
You know it's just as well  
'Cause after a while and a thousand miles  
It all becomes the same  
  
I am the entertainer  
I bring to you my songs  
I'd like to spend a day or two  
I can't stay that long  
No, I've got to meet expenses  
I got to stay in line  
Gotta get those fees to the agencies  
And I'd love to stay but there's bills to pay  
So I just don't have the time  
  
I am the entertainer  
I come to do my show  
You've heard my latest record  
It's been on the radio  
Ah, it took me years to write it  
They were the best years of my life  
It was a beautiful song  
But it ran too long  
If you're gonna have a hit  
You gotta make it fit  
So they cut it down to 3:05  
  
I am the entertainer  
The idol of my age  
I make all kinds of money  
When I go on the stage  
Ah, you've seen me in the papers  
I've been in the magazines  
But if I go cold I won't get sold  
I'll get put in the back in the discount rack  
Like another can of beans  
  
I am the entertainer  
And I know just where I stand  
Another serenader  
And another long-haired band  
Today I am your champion  
I may have won your hearts  
But I know the game, you'll forget my name  
I won't be here in another year  
If I don't stay on the charts

Oh, oh, oh  
For the longest time  
Oh, oh, oh  
For the longest time  
If you said goodbye to me tonight  
There would still be music left to write  
What else could I do  
I'm so inspired by you  
That hasn't happened for the longest time  
  
Once I thought my innocence was gone  
Now I know that happiness goes on  
That's where you found me  
When you put your arms around me  
I haven't been there for the longest time  
  
Oh, oh, oh  
For the longest time  
Oh, oh, oh  
For the longest  
I'm that voice you're hearing in the hall  
And the greatest miracle of all  
Is how I need you  
And how you needed me too  
That hasn't happened for the longest time  
  
Maybe this won't last very long  
But you feel so right  
And I could be wrong  
Maybe I've been hoping too hard  
But I've gone this far  
And it's more than I hoped for  
  
Who knows how much further we'll go on  
Maybe I'll be sorry when you're gone  
I'll take my chances  
I forgot how nice romance is  
I haven't been there for the longest time  
  
I had second thoughts at the start  
I said to myself  
Hold on to your heart  
Now I know the woman that you are  
You're wonderful so far  
And it's more than I hoped for  
  
I don't care what consequence it brings  
I have been a fool for lesser things  
I want you so bad  
I think you ought to know that  
I intend to hold you for the longest time

I'm young enough to see the passionate boy that I used to be  
But I'm old enough to say I got a good look at the other side  
I know we got to work real hard, maybe even for the rest of our lives  
But right now I just want to take what I can  
Get tonight  
While the night is still young  
I want to keep making love to you  
While the night is still young  
I'd like to settle down  
Get married  
And maybe have a child someday  
I can see a time coming when I'm gonna throw my suitcase out  
No more separations  
Where you have to say goodnight to a telephone  
Baby I've decided that ain't what this life is all about  
Oh  
While the night is still young  
While the night is still young  
I want to try to make the world brand new  
While the night is still young  
Rock and Roll music was the only thing I  
Ever gave a damn about  
There was something that was missing  
But I never used to wonder why  
Now I know you're the one I need  
To make things right again  
And I may lose the battle  
But you're giving me the will to try  
Oh  
While the night is still young  
Because the night is still young  
I've got a lot of catching up I've got to do  
While the night is still young  
While the night is still young  
I want to try to make the world brand new  
While the night is still young  

All the guns are silent on the Western wall  
And they cleaned the rifles that we never use it all  
And we're writing letters just to pass the time  
And the days go by on The Siegfried Line  
  
Oh, they say the English have given up the war  
And we heard the Russians won't last through '44  
But a longtime soldier has an open mind  
And a man grows old on The Siegfried Line  
  
Soon, soon they say the war will be over, oh, oh  
Home, home, we will be home in the summer, no, no  
  
Oh, we light the campfire and we drank the beer  
And we know the flag we fly must last a thousand years  
And we eat Dutch chocolate and we drink French wine  
And they feed us well on The Siegfried Line  
  
Soon, soon they say the war will be over, oh, oh  
Home, home, we will come home in the summer, la, la, la  
(We will come home, we will come home, we will come home, come home)

Well, we all have a face that we hide away forever  
And we take them out and show ourselves when everyone has gone.  
Some are satin, some are steel,  
Some are silk and some are leather.  
They're the faces of a stranger,  
But we'd love to try them on.  
  
Well, we all fall in love,  
But we disregard the danger,  
Though we share so many secrets,  
There are some we never tell.  
Why were you so surprised that you never saw the stranger?  
Did you ever let your lover see the stranger in yourself?  
  
Don't be afraid to try again.  
Everyone goes south every now and then.  
You've done it.  
Why can't someone else?  
You should know by now.  
You've been there yourself.  
  
Once I used to believe I was such a great romancer.  
Then I came home to a woman that I could not recognize.  
When I pressed her for a reason,  
She refused to even answer.  
It was then I felt the stranger kick me right between the eyes.  
  
Well, we all fall in love  
But we disregard the danger  
Though we share so many secrets  
There are some we never tell  
Why were you so surprised that you never saw the stranger  
Did you ever let your lover see the stranger in yourself.  
  
Don't be afraid to try again.  
Everyone goes south every now and then.  
You've done it.  
Why can't someone else?  
You should know by now.  
You've been there yourself.  
  
You may never understand how the stranger is inspired.  
But he isn't always evil and he is not always wrong.  
Though you drown in good intensions,  
You will never quench the fire.  
You'll give in to your desire when the stranger comes along.

Now we live our lives so nonchalant  
We spend our time so bon vivant  
Our Spanish nights so well arranged  
Those tasteful words that we exchanged  
We know it's all a passing phase  
  
We light our lamps for atmosphere  
And hang our hopes on chandeliers  
I don't know why we even care  
We try and try and get nowhere  
We'll change our minds, we changed our ways  
These Rhinestone Days  
  
So go our lives so nonchalant  
We spend our time so bon vivant  
I don't know why we even care  
We try and try and get nowhere  
We'll change our minds, we changed our ways  
These Rhinestone Days

The cold hands  
The sad eyes  
The dark Irish silence  
It's so late  
But I'll wait  
Through the long night with you  
With you  
The warm tears  
The bad dreams  
The soft trembling shoulders  
The old fears  
But I'm here  
Through the long night with you  
With you  
Oh, what has it cost you  
I almost lost you  
A long, long time ago  
Oh, you should have told me  
But you had to bleed to know  
All your past sins  
Are since past  
You should be sleeping  
It's all right  
Sleep tight  
Through the long night with me  
With me  
No, I didn't start it  
You're broken hearted  
From a long, long time ago  
Oh, the way you hold me  
Is all that I need to know  
And it's so late  
But I'll wait  
Through the long night with you  
With you  
  

When the rain is blowing in your face  
And the whole world is on your case,  
I would offer you a warm embrace  
To make you feel my love.  
  
When the evening shadows and the stars appear  
And there is no one there to dry your tears,  
I could hold you for a million years  
To make you feel my love.  
  
I know you haven't made your mind up yet  
But I would never do you wrong.  
I've known it from the moment that we met,  
No doubt in my mind where you belong.  
  
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue,  
I'd go crawling down the avenue,  
There's nothing that I wouldn't do  
To make you feel my love.  
  
The storms are raging on a rolling sea,  
Down on the highway of regret.  
The winds of change are blowing wild and free,  
You ain't seen nothing like me yet.  
  
I did make you happy, make your dreams come true,  
There's nothing that I would not do,  
Go to the ends of the earth for you  
To make you feel my love.  
There's nothing that I wouldn't do  
To make you feel my love.

I've been livin' for the moment  
But I just can't have my way  
And I'm afraid to go to sleep  
Cause tomorrow is today  
  
People tell me life is sweeter  
But I don't hear what they say  
Nothing comes to change my life  
So tomorrow is today  
  
I don't care to know the hour  
Cause it's passing anyway  
I don't have to see tomorrow  
Cause I saw it yesterday  
  
So I listen for an answer  
But the feeling seems to stay  
And what's the use of always dreaming  
If tomorrow is today  
  
Still I'm waiting for the morning  
But it feels so far away  
And you don't need the love I'm giving  
So tomorrow is today  
  
Oh, my. Goin' to the river  
Gonna take a ride and the Lord will deliver me  
Made my bed, now I'm gonna lie in it  
If you don't come, I'm sure gonna die in it  
Too late. Too much given  
I've seen a lot of life and I'm damn sick of livin' it  
I keep hopin' that you will pass my way  
  
And some day if your dreams are leavin' you  
I'll still believe in you  
  
I don't care to know the hour  
Cause it's passing anyway  
I don't have to see tomorrow  
Cause I saw it yesterday  
  
Though I'm living and I'm singing  
And although my hands still play  
Soon enough it will all be over  
Cause tomorrow is today

In the beginning  
There was the cold and the night  
Prophets and angels gave us the fire and the light  
Man was triumphant  
Armed with the faith and the will  
Even the darkest ages couldn't kill  
  
Too many kingdoms  
Too many flags on the field  
So many battles, so many wounds to be healed  
Time is relentless  
Only true love perseveres  
It's been a long time and now I'm with you  
After two thousand years  
  
This is our moment  
Here at the crossroads of time  
We hope our children carry our dreams down the line  
They are the vintage  
What kind of life will they live?  
Is this a curse or a blessing that we give?  
  
Sometimes I wonder  
Why are we so blind to fate?  
Without compassion, there can be no end to hate  
No end to sorrow  
Caused by the same endless fears  
Why can't we learn from all we've been through  
After two thousand years?  
  
There will be miracles  
After the last war is won  
Science and poetry rule in the new world to come  
Prophets and angels  
Gave us the power to see  
What an amazing future there will be  
  
And in the evening  
After the fire and the light  
One thing is certain: Nothing can hold back the night  
Time is relentless  
And as the past disappears  
We're on the verge of all things new  
We are two thousand years

I never ask you where you go  
After I leave you in the morning  
We go our different ways to separate situations  
It's not that easy anymore  
Today I do what must be done  
I give my time to total strangers  
But now it feels as though the day goes on forever  
MOre than it ever did before  
CHORUS  
Until the night, until the night  
I just might make it  
Until the night, until the night  
When I see you again  
Now you're afraid that we have changed  
And I'm afraid we're getting older  
So many broken hearts, so many lonely faces  
So many lovers come and gone  
I'll have my fears like every man  
You'll have your tears like every woman  
Today we'll be unsure, is this what we believe in  
And wonder how can we go on  
CHORUS  
When the sun goes down  
And the day is over  
When the last of the light has gone  
As they pour into the street  
I will be getting closer  
As the cars turn their headlights on  
While they're closing it down  
We're gonna open it up  
And while they're going to sleep  
We'll just be starting to touch  
I'm just beginning to feel  
I'm just beginning to give  
I'm just beginning to feel  
I'm just beginning to live  
Before I leave you again  
Before the light of the dawn  
Before this evening can end  
I have been waiting so long  
CHORUS  
  

Slow down, you crazy child  
You're so ambitious for a juvenile  
But then if you're so smart, then tell me  
Why are you still so afraid?  
  
Where's the fire, what's the hurry about?  
You'd better cool it off before you burn it out  
You've got so much to do  
And only so many hours in a day  
  
But you know that when the truth is told  
That you can get what you want or you get old  
You're gonna kick off before you even  
Get halfway through  
When will you realize, Vienna waits for you  
  
Slow down, you're doing fine  
You can't be everything you want to be  
Before your time  
Although it's so romantic on the borderline tonight  
Tonight,  
Too bad but it's the life you lead  
You're so ahead of yourself that you forgot what you need  
Though you can see when you're wrong, you know  
You can't always see when you're right. you're right  
  
You've got your passion, you've got your pride  
But don't you know that only fools are satisfied?  
Dream on, but don't imagine they'll all come true  
When will you realize, Vienna waits for you?  
  
Slow down, you crazy child  
And take the phone off the hook and disappear for awhile  
It's all right, you can afford to lose a day or two  
When will you realize, Vienna waits for you?  
And you know that when the truth is told  
That you can get what you want or you can just get old  
You're gonna kick off before you even get half through  
Why don't you realize, Vienna waits for you  
When will you realize, Vienna waits for you?

This back-breakin', bone-shakin', belly-achin', hard-workin'  
Two more hours to go  
Yes, it's keeping me alive doin' nine to five  
And I ain't got nothin to show  
Pretty soon I'll be leavin'  
With the wages I'm receivin'  
But I know it's gonna be all right  
Come on, babe, and take me away  
We got some money to spend tonight  
Pick me up at the station  
Meet me at the train  
Have a meal and a shower and a change of clothes  
I can't afford a vacation  
But I can take the strain  
Long as I can be with you  
Find a way to burn it as quickly as I earn it  
Yes, it's back-breakin', bone-shakin', belly-achin', hard-workin'  
Two more hours to go  
Seven long years for the same corporation  
And I ain't got nothin' to show  
And tonight when I'm leavin' I'll be just breakin' even  
But I know it's gonna be all right  
I shake off my blues when you put on your shoes  
We got some money to spend tonight  
Oh, I don't wanna stand here and sound accusin'  
Everybody does their share of losin'  
If I'm gonna lose it I might as well be doin' it right  
Pick me up at the station  
Meet me at the train  
Have a meal and a shower and a change of clothes  
I can't afford a vacation  
But I can take the strain  
Long as I can be with you  
Find a way to burn it as quickly as I earn it  
Yes, it's back-breakin', bone-shakin', belly-achin', hard-workin'  
Two more hours to go  
Yes, it's keepin' me alive doin' nine to five  
And I ain't got nothin' to show  
And tonight when I'm leavin' I'll be just breakin' even  
But I know it's gonna be all right  
Come on, babe, and take me away  
We got some money to spend tonight  
Come on, babe, take me away  
We got some money to spend tonight  

When a star is born, they receive a gift or two  
One of them is this, they have the power to make a dream come true  
  
When you wish upon a star, makes no difference who you are  
Anything your heart desires will come to you  
If your heart is in your dream, no request is too extreme  
When you wish upon a star as dreamers do  
  
Fate is kind she brings to those who love  
Love's sweet fulfillment of their secret longing  
  
Like a bolt out of the blue, fate steps in and sees you through  
When you wish upon a star, your dreams come true  
  
Ooh, like a bolt out of the blue, fate steps in and I sees you through  
When you wish upon a star, your dreams come true, ooh, ooh

Where were you on our wedding day?  
I got bad news that you went away  
Where were you on our wedding day?  
You did me wrong now you must pay  
Whoa oh (whoa oh) give me back my ring (my ring) whoa oh (whoa oh)  
Whoa oh (whoa oh) I ain't gonna let you keep a thing (a thing), whoa oh  
  
Where were you when I said "I do"?  
Everybody laughed and my inlaws too  
Where were you when I turned around  
Someplace you knew you never could be found  
Whoa oh (whoa oh), give me back my ring (my ring), whoa oh (whoa oh)  
Whoa oh (whoa oh), I ain't gonna let you keep a thing (a thing), whoa oh  
  
Where were you when I searched the town?  
And turned the whole neighborhood upside down  
Where were you, little girl I say?  
Where were you on our wedding day?  
Whoa oh (whoa oh), give me back my ring (my ring), whoa oh (whoa oh)  
Whoa oh (whoa oh), I ain't gonna let you keep a thing (a thing), whoa oh

Where's the orchestra?  
Wasn't this supposed to be a musical?  
Here I am  
In the balcony,  
How the hell could I have missed the overture?  
  
I like the scenery  
Even though, I have absolutely no, idea at all,  
What is being said, despite the dialogue,  
There's the leading man  
  
The movie star who never faced an audience  
Where's the orchestra?  
After all, this is my big night on the town  
My introduction to the theatre crowd  
  
I assumed that the show would have a song  
So I was wrong  
At least I understand  
All the innuendo and the irony  
  
And I appreciate,  
The roles the actors played  
The point the author made  
And after the closing lines,  
  
And after the curtain calls,  
The curtain falls  
On empty chairs,  
Where's the orchestra?

One minute I'm in Central Park  
Then I'm down on Delancey Street  
From the Bow'ry to St. Marks  
There's a syncopated beat  
  
Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo  
I'm streetwise, I can improvise  
Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo  
I'm streetsmart, I've got New York City heart  
  
Why should I worry?  
Why should I care?  
I may not have a dime  
But I got street savoire faire  
  
Why should I worry?  
Why should I care?  
It's just bebopulation  
And I got street saviore faire  
  
The rhythm of the city  
But once you get it down  
Then you can own this town  
You can wear the crown  
  
Why should I worry?  
Why should I care?  
I may not have a dime  
But I got street savoire faire  
  
Why should I worry?  
Why should I care?  
It's just bebopulation  
And I got street saviore faire  
  
Ev'rything goes  
Ev'rything fits  
They love me at the Chelsea  
They adore me at the Ritz  
  
Why should I worry?  
Why should I care?  
And even when I cross that line  
I got street savoire faire

Today I'm livin' like a rich man's son  
Tomorrow mornin' I could be a bum  
It doesn't matter which direction, though  
I know a woman in New Mexico  
Chorus:  
Worse comes to worst  
I'll get along  
I don't know how, but sometimes  
I can be strong  
Oh, and if I don't have a car, I'll hitch  
I got a thumb and she's a son of a bitch  
I do my writing on my road guitar  
And make a living at a piano bar, oh  
Chorus  
Lightning and thunder  
Flashed across the roads we drove upon  
Oh, but it's clear skies we're under  
When I am together, when I sing the song  
Chorus  
Oh, fun ain't easy if it ain't free  
Too many people got a hold on me  
But I know something that they don't know  
I know a woman in New Mexico  
Chorus 3x and fade  

You can make me free  
You can make me smile  
You can make me be  
Like a little child  
  
You can melt the ice that chills my body  
You can dry my every tear  
You make the lonely hours disappear  
  
You can make me free  
You can make me rise  
You can make me see  
So open up my eyes  
  
Don't you know my only real moments  
Are the ones I spend with you  
How I long to drink some wine again with you  
  
I can take to the skies  
I can soar like a bird with its heart full of song  
Won't you color my eyes  
I've been waiting so long  
  
You can make me free  
You can make me cry  
You can make it so much better  
If you would only try  
  
And if I must wait a lonely lifetime  
Until I am with you, my love  
I will wait but you'll be what I'm dreamin' of  
  
I can take to the skies  
I can soar like a bird with his heart full of song  
Won't you cover my eyes  
I've been waiting so long  
  
You can make me free  
You can make me cry  
You can make it so much better  
If you would only try  
  
And if I must wait a lonely lifetime  
Until I am with you, my love  
I will wait but you'll be what I'm dreamin' of  
  
I can take to the skies  
I can soar like a bird with his heart full of song  
Won't you cover my eyes  
I've been waiting so long  
  
You can make me free  
You can make me cry  
You can make it so much better  
If you would only try  
  
And if I must wait a lonely lifetime  
Until I am with you, my love  
I will wait but you'll be what I'm dreamin' of  
  
You can make me free  
You can make me cry  
You can make it so much better  
If you would only try

Ah, you look so good to me  
With my eyes open wide, I can see  
Ah, you feel so good to me  
And it's so good when you're here 'cause I'm free  
Feelin' the glory from that smile upon your face  
It's liftin' me high above my ordinary place  
And I am so happy when I'm in your warm embrace  
Ah, you look so good to me  
With my eyes open wide, I can see  
Ah, you feel so good to me  
And who knows what your next move will be?  
Ah, you look so good to me  
With my eyes open wide, I can see  
Ah, you feel so good to me  
And it's so good when you're here 'cause I'm free  

Friday night I crashed your party  
Saturday I said I'm sorry  
Sunday came and trashed me out again  
I was only having fun  
Wasn't hurting any one  
And we all enjoyed the weekend for a change  
  
I was stranded in the combat zone  
I walked through Bedford Stuy alone  
Even rode my motorcycle in the rain  
And you told me not to drive  
But I made it home alive  
So you said that only proves that I'm insane  
  
You may be right  
I may be crazy  
But it just may be a lunatic you're looking for  
Turn out the light  
Don't try to save me  
You may be wrong for all I know  
But you may be right  
  
Remember how I found you there  
Alone in your electric chair  
I told you dirty jokes until you smiled  
You were lonely for a man  
I said take me as I am  
Cause you might enjoy some madness for a while  
  
Now think of all the years you tried to  
Find someone to satisfy you  
I might be as crazy as you say  
If I'm crazy then it's true  
That it's all because of you  
And you wouldn't want me any other way  
  
You may be right  
I may be crazy  
But it just may be a lunatic you're looking for  
It's too late to fight  
It's too late to change me  
You may be wrong for all I know  
But you may be right  
  
You may be right  
I may be crazy  
But it just may be a lunatic you're looking for  
Turn out the light  
Don't try to save me  
You may be wrong for all I know  
But you may be right  
You may be wrong but you may be right  
You may be wrong but you may be right

Don't get me wrong,  
I ain't the kind  
To turn away from you  
When something's on your mind.  
  
But you have to know,  
You just have to see,  
I'm having my troubles, babe,  
And they're all too much for me.  
  
You picked a real bad time  
To spoil my concentration  
You picked a real bad time  
To pass along the bad news  
Tell me, why you try  
To give me aggravation  
You picked a real bad time  
'Cause this man's got the blues  
  
Don't get me wrong,  
You're not alone  
And I'd like to help you  
But I've got problems of my own  
  
It's a bitter phase  
I'm going through  
And I can run from strangers, darlin',  
But I just can't hide from you.  
  
You picked a real bad time  
To spoil my concentration  
You picked a real bad time  
To pass along the bad news  
Tell me, why you try  
To give me aggravation  
You picked a real bad time  
And I got time to lose  
  
Ain't it the truth  
When they say  
That the only thing worth dying for  
Is our freedom  
Ain't it the proof  
That someday  
We will all be lying on our backs  
Free at last from income tax  
  
Don't you get me wrong  
The mood won't last  
And I'll be myself again  
Soon as this pain has passed  
  
And I'm standing here,  
Don't ask me how,  
I'll make it up to you,  
Someday but not right now  
  
You picked a real bad time  
To spoil my concentration  
You picked a real bad time  
To pass along the bad news  
You caused a real hard line  
To invade my isolation  
You picked a real bad time  
'Cause this man's got the blues  
  
Ain't it the truth  
When they say  
All you need is love but all you'll want is forgiveness  
Ain't it the proof  
That someday  
Even love will not provide for man  
The way that life insurance can  
  
You picked a real bad time  
To spoil my concentration  
You picked a real bad time  
To pass along the bad news  
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me  
Why you tryin' to give me aggravation  
You picked a real bad time, cause this man's got the blues.

When you look into my eyes  
And you see the crazy gypsy in my soul  
It always comes as a surprise  
When I feel my withered roots begin to grow  
  
Well I never had a place  
That I could call my very own  
But that's all right my love  
'Cause you're my home.  
  
When you touch my weary head  
And you tell me everything will be all right  
You say use my body for your bed  
And my love will keep you warm throughout the night  
  
Well I'll never be a stranger  
And I'll never be alone  
Wherever we're together  
That's my home.  
  
Home could be the Pennsylvania turnpike  
Indiana's early morning dew  
High up in the hills of California  
Home is just another word for you  
  
Well I never had a place that I could call my very own  
But that's all right my love 'cause you're my home  
  
If I travel all my life  
And I never get stop and settle down  
Long as I have you by my side  
There's a roof above and good walls all around  
You're my castle, you're my cabin  
And my instant pleasure dome  
I need you in my house  
'Cause you're my home,  
You're my home.

You're having a hard time and lately you don't feel so good  
You're getting a bad reputation in your neighborhood  
It's alright  
It's alright  
Sometimes that's what it takes  
You're only human  
You're allowed to make your share of mistakes  
You better believe there will be times in your life  
When you'll be feeling like a stumbling fool  
So take it from me you'll learn more from your accidents  
Than anything that you could ever learn at school  
Don't forget your second wind  
Sooner of later you'll get your second wind  
It's not always easy to be living in this world of pain  
You're gonna be crashing into stone walls again and again  
It's alright  
It's alright  
Though you feel your heart break  
You're only human  
You're gonna have to deal with heartache  
Just like a boxer in a title fight  
You got to walk in that ring all alone  
You're not the only one who's made mistakes  
But they're the only thing that you can truly call your own  
Don't forget your second wind  
Wait in that corner until that breeze blows in  
You've been keeping to yourself these days  
Cause you're thinking everything's gone wrong  
Sometimes you just want to lay down and die  
That emotion can be so strong  
But hold on  
Till that old second wind comes along  
You probably don't want to hear advice from someone else  
But I wouldn't be telling you if I hadn't been there myself  
It's alright  
It's alright  
Sometimes that's all it takes  
We're only human  
We're supposed to make mistakes  
But I survived all those long lonely days  
When it seemed I did not have a friend  
Cause all I needed was a little faith  
So I could catch my breath and face the world again  
Don't forget your second wind  
Sooner or later you'll feel that momentum kick in  
Don't forget your second wind  
Sooner or later you'll feel that momentum kick in

I don't know what you've got  
But it's getting to me  
Makes my cold nights hot  
Hot wind just goes right through me  
  
We're hummin', baby  
It's in your hands  
'Cause you've got me hummin', yeah  
'Cause you've got me hummin', yeah  
  
Wow, wake up early at night  
I can't go back to sleep  
I even walk alone on red lights  
I tied my tongue and try to speak  
  
When it's my time to walk  
When my feet is startin' to run  
'Cause you've got me hummin', yeah  
'Cause you've got me hummin', yeah  
  
Oh no  
Tough baby

Ali dances and the audience applauds  
Though he's bathed in sweat he hasn't lost his style  
Ali don't you go downtown  
You gave away another round for free  
  
Me, I'm just another face at Zanzibar  
But the waitress always serves a secret smile  
She's waiting out in Shantytown  
She's gonna pull the curtains down for me, for me  
  
I've got the old man's car  
I've got a jazz guitar  
I've got a tab at Zanzibar  
Tonight that's where I'll be, I'll be  
  
Rose, he knows he's such a credit to the game  
But the Yankees grab the headline every time  
Melodrama's so much fun  
In black and white for everyone to see  
  
Me, I'm trying just to get to second base  
And I'd steal it if she only gave the sign  
She's gonna give the go head  
The inning isn't over yet for me, for me  
  
I've got the old man's car  
I've got a jazz guitar  
I've got a tab at Zanzibar  
Tonight that's where I'll be  
  
Tell the waitress I'll come back to Zanzibar  
I'll be hiding in the darkness with my beer  
She's waiting out in Shantytown  
She's gonna pull the curtains down for me, for me  
  
I've got the old man's car  
I've got a jazz guitar  
I've got a tab at Zanzibar  
Tonight that's where I'll be
