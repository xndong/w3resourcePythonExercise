Once upon a time a song was heard  
Giving birth to a child of Earth and verse  
  
Together we slay another fright  
Every Jubjub bird, spooks of the past  
Close your eyes and take a peek  
The truth is easy to see  
  
We were here, roaming on the endless prairie  
Writing an endless story  
Building a Walden of our own  
We were here, grieving the saddened faces  
Conquering the darkest places  
Time to rest now, and to finish the show  
And become the music, one with alpenglow  
  
Hand in hand guiding me into light  
You, the fairy tale guise in blue and white  
  
Together we slay another fright  
Every Jub-jub birds moves soft and fast  
Close your eyes and take a peek  
The truth is easy to see  
  
We were here...  
We were here, roaming on the endless prairie  
Writing an endless story  
Building a Walden of our own  
We were here, grieving the saddened faces  
Conquering the darkest places  
Time to rest now, and to finish the show  
And become the music, one with alpenglow  
  
You are my path, my home, my star  
A beautiful tale within the tale  
And when the dust needs to move on  
I will tuck us in on a bed of snow  
Painting white, silencing the valley we built  
Together we'll sleep, devoured by life  
  
We were here, roaming the endless prairie  
Writing an endless story  
Building a Walden of our own  
We were here, grieving the saddened faces  
Conquering the darkest places  
Time to rest now, and to finish the show  
And become the music, one with alpenglow  
  
We were here, roaming on the endless prairie  
Writing an endless story  
Building a Walden of our own  
We were here, grieving the saddened faces  
Conquering the darkest places  
Time to rest now, and to finish the show  
And become the music, one with alpenglow

An angelface smiles to me  
Under a headline of tragedy  
That smile used to give me warmth  
Farewell - no words to say  
beside the cross on your grave  
and those forever burning candles  
  
Needed elsewhere  
to remind us of the shortness of our time  
Tears laid for them  
Tears of love, tears of fear  
Bury my dreams, dig up my sorrows  
Oh, Lord why  
the angels fall first  
  
Not relieved by thougts of Shangri-La  
Nor enlightened by lessons of Christ  
I'll never understand the meaning of the right  
Ignorance lead me into the light  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Sing me a song  
of your beauty  
of your kingdom  
Let the melodies of your harps  
caress those whom we still need  
  
Yesterday we shook hands  
My friend  
Today a moonbeam lightens my path  
My guardian

Norsemen hearts belong to you  
Ancient God of war  
You have created a sacred world  
In asgard is your throne  
Time has come to praise the God  
Crazy beings were living here  
In superstitious fear  
Angry Gods would ever cause  
Pestilence or war  
Time has come to praise it has come  
Do it over and over again  
Praise him for the upcoming war  
You won't feel astray  
He's got power in his hand  
So cry aloud his name  
Odin used to overlook  
From the exalted throne  
Gazed towards south and west  
The goal of all the hopes  
Time has come to praise it has come  
Do it over and over again  
Praise him for the upcoming war  
You won't feel astray  
He's got power in his hand  
So cry aloud his name  
  
Asgard protects the warriors  
Asgard shelter of Gods  
  
Evil grew among the Gods  
Holy Sagrad fault  
Noone praise it started now  
The twilight of the Gods  
Time has come to praise it has come  
Do it over and over again  
Praise him for the upcoming war  
You won't feel astray  
He's got power in his hand  
So cry aloud his name  
  
Asgard protects the warriors  
Asgard shelter of Gods

A nocturnal concerto  
Candlelight whispers me where to go  
Hymn of gathering stars as my guide  
As I wander on this path of the night  
  
Embroidery of the stars  
Undress my feelings for this earth  
Send me your salva to heal my scars  
And let this nakedness me my birth  
  
Macrocosm poured its powers on me  
And the hopes of this world I now must leave  
The nightwish I sent you centuries ago  
Has been heard by those who dwelled in a woe  
  
The distance of our bridal bed  
Await for me to be dead  
Dust of the galaxies take my hand  
Lead me to my beloved's land  
  
The constant longing for your touch  
This bitter ocean of hatred and pain  
This loneliness I need to be who I am  
  
The oceans are alone as I  
Somebody take away this gift of mine  
No charisma for the beast! But still I love you forevermore  
  
Come to me  
Deliver me from you  
And from all the days of the Earth  
  
No last words to say  
Only memories remain  
A farewell then, my path goes forever

Once I had a dream  
And this is it  
  
Once there was a child's dream  
One night the clock struck twelve  
The window opened wide  
Once there was a child's heart  
The age I learned to fly  
And took a step outside  
  
Once I knew all the tales  
It's time to turn back time  
Follow the pale moonlight  
Once I wished for this night  
Faith brought me here  
It's time to cut the rope and fly  
  
To a dream  
Far across the sea  
All the burdens gone  
Open the chest once more  
Dark chest of wonders  
Seen through the eyes  
Of the one with pure heart  
Once so long ago  
  
The one in the Big Blue is what the world stole from me  
This night will bring him back to me  
  
Fly to a dream

Born from silence, silence full of it  
A perfect concert my best friend  
So much to live for, so much to die for  
If only my heart had a home  
  
Sing what you can't say  
Forget what you can't play  
Hasten to drown into beautiful eyes  
Walk within my poetry, this dying music  
My love letter to nobody  
  
Never sigh for better world  
It's already composed, played and told  
Every thought the music I write  
Everything a wish for the night  
  
Wrote for the eclipse, wrote for the virgin  
Died for the beauty the one in the garden  
Created a kingdom, reached for the wisdom  
Failed in becoming a god  
  
Never sigh  
  
"If you read this line, remember not the hand that wrote it  
Remember only the verse, songmaker's cry, the one without tears  
For I've given this its strength and it has become my only strength.  
Comforting home, mother's lap, chance for immortality  
Where being wanted became a thrill I never knew  
The sweet piano writing down my life"  
  
"Teach me passion for I fear it's gone  
Show me love, hold the lorn  
So much more I wanted to give to the ones who love me  
I'm sorry  
Time will tell (this bitter farewell)  
I live no more to shame nor me nor you  
  
And you, I wish I didn't feel for you anymore"  
  
A lonely soul, an ocean soul

The story behind the painting  
I drew is already told  
No more tear stains on the pages of my diary  
Tired by unable to give up since I'm  
Responsible for the lives I saved  
  
The play is done  
The curtain's down  
  
All the tales are told  
All the orchids gone  
Lost in my own world  
Now I care for dead gardens  
  
My song is little worth anymore  
Time to lay this weary pen aside  
  
The play is done  
The curtain's down  
  
"Where are the wolves, the underwater moon  
The eleventh, the haven of youth  
Lagoons of the starlit sea  
Have I felt enough for one man's deed?  
Or is it time to challenge the Ancient of Days  
And let the virgin conceive"  
  
All the tales

The sheltering shade of the forest  
Calling calming silence  
Accompanied only by the full moon  
The howling of the night wolf  
And the path under my bare feet,  
The Elvenpath  
  
Sung, female:  
Hearing music from the deepest forest  
Songs as a seduction of sirens  
The elf-folk is calling me  
  
Tapio, Bear-king, Ruler of the forest  
Mielikki, Bluecloak, Healer of the I'll and sad  
Open the gate and let me follow the uncarven path  
  
The way to the lands  
Where as a hero I stand  
The path where Beauty met the Beast  
Elvenpath  
It's the honesty of these worlds  
Ruled by magic and mighty swords  
That makes my soul long for the past  
Elvenpath  
  
The moonwitch took me to a ride on a broomstick  
Introduced me to her old friend home gnome  
Told me to keep the sauna warm for him  
  
At the grove I met the rest - the folk of my fantasies  
Bilbo, Sparhawk, goblins and pixies  
Snowman, Willow, trolls and the seven dwarves  
The path goes forever on  
  
The way to the lands  
Where as a hero I stand  
The path where Beauty met the Beast  
Elvenpath  
It's the honesty of these worlds  
Ruled by magic and mighty swords  
That makes my soul long for the past  
Elvenpath  
  
Spoken, male:  
Long ago,  
In the early years of the Second Age,  
Great elven smiths forged rings of power.  
  
Sung, female:  
As I return to my room  
And as sleep takes me by my hand  
Madrigals from the woods  
Carry me to neverland  
In this spellbound night  
The world's an elvish sight  
In this spellbound night  
The world's an elvish sight  
  
But then, the Dark Lord learned  
The craft of ring making and made the master ring.

6:30 winter morn  
Snow keeps falling, silent dawn  
A rose by any other name  
Eva leaves her Swanbrook home  
A kindest heart which always made  
Me ashamed of my own  
She walks alone but not without her name  
  
Eva flies away  
Dreams the world far away  
In this cruel children's game  
There's no friend to call her name  
Eva sails away  
Dreams the world far away  
The Good in her will be my sunflower field  
  
Mocked by man to depths of shame  
Little girl with life ahead  
For a memory of one kind word  
She would stay among the beasts  
Time for one more daring dream  
Before her escape, edenbeam  
We kill with her own loving heart  
  
Eva flies away  
Dreams the world far away  
In this cruel children's game  
There's no friend to call her name  
Eva sails away  
Dreams the world far away  
The Good in her will be my sunflower field

Ever felt away with me  
Just once that all I need  
Entwined in finding you one day  
Ever felt away without me  
My love, it lies so deep  
Ever dream of me  
  
Would you do it with me  
Heal the scars and change the stars  
Would you do it for me  
Turn loose the heaven within  
  
I'd take you away  
Castaway on a lonely day  
Bosom for a teary cheek  
My song can but borrow your grace  
  
Ever felt away  
  
Come out, come out wherever you are  
So lost in your sea  
Give in, give in for my touch  
For my taste for my lust  
  
Ever felt away  
  
Your beauty cascaded on me  
In this white night fantasy  
  
Ever felt away

Wish upon a star  
Take a step enter the land  
Walk through the air  
Take my hand  
Wishmaster's will  
Join him the quest for dream  
A make-believe  
Is all we ever need  
Wish upon a star  
No matter who you are  
The second star to the right  
Harbinger's gate  
Beyond the boundaries  
Blossom ballet  
In the great wide somewhere  
Wish upon a star  
Believe in will  
The realm of the king of fantasy  
The master of the tale-like lore  
The way to kingdom I adore  
Where the warrior's heart is pure  
Where the stories will come true  
  
A cub of the king betrayed by usurper  
A girl in the rain swearing to her father's name  
Belle the last sight for the dying gruesome  
The beauties sleeping awaiting  
Deep in a dream  
For true love's first kiss  
  
Bald Mountain Night  
Devilheart endures but light  
A mad aerial dance  
Chernabog's succubi  
Black Cauldron born  
Gurgi's heart forlorn  
Pig-keeper or hero  
On a quest of augury  
Maleficent's fury  
The spindle so luring  
Dragon fight, dying night  
Dooming might  
Apprentice of Yen Sid  
Conducting the galaxy  
Dreamer on mountaintop  
Spellbound masquerade  
The Sailor an idol for the six-year-old in me  
The Phoenix of White Agony Creek  
Enchantress, A mermaid in a tale as old as time  
A Dragonslayer, The Awakener  
Wish upon a star

You were my first love  
The earth moving under me  
Bedroom scent, beauty ardent  
Distant shiver, heaven sent  
  
I'm the snow on your lips  
The freezing taste, the silvery sip  
I'm the breath on your hair  
The endless nightmare, devil's lair  
  
Only so many times  
I can say I long for you  
The lily among the thorns  
The prey among the wolves  
  
Someday, I will feed a snake  
Drink her venom, stay awake  
With time all pain will fade  
Through your memory I will wade  
  
Barely cold in her grave  
Barely warm in my bed  
Settling for a draw tonight  
Puppet girl, your strings are mine  
  
This one is for you for you  
Only for you  
Just give in to it never think again  
I feel for you

Heaven today has gone away  
To a place I once called home  
Heart of a child, one final sigh  
As another love goes cold  
Once my heart beat to the  
Rhythm of the falling snow  
Blackened below, the river now flows  
A stream of mountain virgin snow  
  
[Chorus]  
For the heart I'll never have  
For the child forever gone  
The music flows because it longs  
For the heart I once had  
  
Living today, without a place  
To understand the weight of the world  
Faded and torn, old and forlorn  
My weak and hoping heart  
For the child, for the night  
For the heart I once had  
I believe and foresee  
Everything I could ever be  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Time will not heal  
A dead boy's scars  
Time will kill  
  
[Chorus]

Fare thee well, little broken heart  
Downcast eyes, lifetime loneliness  
  
Whatever walks in my heart will walk alone  
  
Constant longing for the perfect soul  
Unwashed scenery forever gone  
  
Whatever walks in my heart will walk alone  
  
No love left in me  
No eyes to see the heaven beside me  
My time is yet to come  
So I'll be forever yours  
  
Whatever walks in my heart will walk alone  
  
No love left in me  
No eyes to see the heaven beside me  
My time is yet to come  
So I'll be forever yours  
  
No love left in me  
No eyes to see the heaven beside me  
My time is yet to come  
So I'll be forever yours  
  
Whatever walks in my heart will walk alone

Toll no bell for me father  
But let this cup of suffering pass from me  
Send me no shepherd to heal my world  
But the angel, the dream foretold  
Prayed more than thrice for you to see  
The wolf of loneliness in me  
Not my own will but yours be done  
  
You wake up where's the tomb?  
Will easter come, enter my room?  
The lord weeps with me  
But my tears fall for you  
  
Another beauty  
Loved by a beast  
Another tale of infinite dreams  
Your eyes they were my paradise  
Your smile made my sun rise  
  
Forgive me for I don't know what I gain  
Alone in this garden of pain  
Enchantment has but one truth:  
I weep to have what I fear to lose  
  
You wake up where's the tomb?  
Will easter come, enter my room?  
The lord weeps with me  
But my tears fall for you  
  
"I knew you never before  
I see you never more  
But the love the pain the hope o beautiful one  
Have made you mine 'till all my years are done"  
  
Without you  
The poetry within me is dead

We used to swim the same moonlight waters  
Oceans away from the wakeful day  
  
My fall will be for you  
My fall will be for you  
My love will be in you  
If you be the one to cut me  
I'll bleed forever  
  
Scent of the sea before waking afterwards  
Brings me to thee  
Into the blue memory  
  
My fall will be for you  
  
Into the blue memory  
  
A siren from the deep came to me  
Sang my name my longing  
Still I write my songs about that dream of mine  
Worth everything I may ever be  
  
The Child will be born again  
That siren carried him to me  
First of them true lovers  
Singing on the shoulders of an angel  
Without care for love n' loss  
  
Bring me home or leave me be  
My love in the dark heart of the night  
I have lost the path before me  
the one behind will lead me  
  
Take me  
Cure me  
Kill me  
Bring me home  
Every way  
Every day  
Just another loop in the hangman's noose  
  
Take me, cure me, kill me, bring me home  
Every way, every day  
I keep on watching us sleep  
  
Relive the old sin of  
Adam and Eve  
Of you and me  
Forgive the adoring beast  
  
Redeem me into childhood  
Show me myself without the shell  
Like the advent of May  
I'll be there when you say  
Time to never hold our love  
  
My fall will be for you

[Pink Floyd cover]  
  
Beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young.  
In a world of magnets and miracles  
Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary,  
The ringing of the division bell had begun.  
  
Along the Long Road and on down to the causeway,  
Do they still meet there by the Cut  
  
There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps  
Running before time took our dreams away  
Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground,  
To a life consumed by slow decay.  
  
The grass was greener  
The light was brighter  
With friends surrounding  
The nights of wonder  
  
Looking beyond the embers of the bridges glowing behind us  
To a glimpse at our great lose of the other side  
Steps taken forward but sleepwalking back again,  
Dragged by force of some inner tide  
  
But the highest altitude with flag unfurled  
We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world  
  
Encumbered forever by desire and ambition,  
There's hunger still unsatisfied,  
Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon,  
Though down this road we've been so many times.  
  
The grass was greener  
The light was brighter  
The taste was sweeter  
The nights of wonder  
With friends surrounded  
The dark mist growing  
The water flowing  
The endless river  
Forever and ever [x2]

Time it took the most of me  
And left me with no key  
To unlock the chest of remedy  
Mother, the pain ain't hurting me  
But the love that I feel  
When you hold me near  
  
The hopes were high  
The choirs were vast  
Now my dreams are left to live through you  
  
Red Sun rising  
Drown without inhaling  
Within, the dark holds hard  
Red Sun rising  
Curtain falling  
Higher than hope my cure lies  
  
Passion tide  
An angel by my side  
  
But no Christ to end this war  
To deliver my soul from the sword  
Hope has show me a scenery  
Paradise poetry  
With first snow I'll be gone  
  
The hopes were high  
  
Red Sun rising  
  
Your death saved me  
  
Red Sun rising

The treetops, the chimneys, the snowbed stories, winter grey  
Wildflowers, those meadows of heaven, wind in the wheat  
  
A railroad across waters, the scent of grandfatherly love  
Blue bayous, Decembers, moon through a dragonfly's wings  
  
Where is the wonder where's the awe  
Where's dear Alice knocking on the door  
Where's the trapdoor that takes me there  
Where's the real is shattered by a Mad Marsh Hare  
  
Where is the wonder where's the awe  
Where are the sleepless nights I used to live for  
Before the years take me  
I wish to see  
The lost in me  
  
I want my tears back  
I want my tears back now  
  
A ballet on a grove, still growing young all alone  
A rag doll, a best friend, the voice of Mary Costa

What does the free fall feel like?  
Asks the boy with a spark in his eye  
Know why the nightingale sings?  
Is the answer to everything  
Taking a step to a world unbound  
Spinning my fantasies all around  
Freed from the gravital leash  
I swear the heaven's in my reach  
Dancing with the spirit of the air  
In this ocean so open and fair  
Making love to the gods above  
On my maiden voyage so bold  
Landing safely to the blue lagoon  
Don't know if this is the earth or the moon  
Joy of living is no more a mask  
The Eden I found will forever last  
Migrating with the geese  
My soul has finally found peace  
Doesn't matter that man has no wings  
As long as I hear the nightingale sing...  

A single grain can tip the scale  
Amidst the burden, the scale will prevail  
Showing what's worth being here  
Storyteller by a hearth of stone  
A white little creature purring me  
My childhood kingdom gone in time  
The islands filling my mind with blue  
The one in special, heaven?s court  
All the joy unforgiven by this task  
An errant soul, homeless and foul  
All gone but the will to live to tell the tale  
The days are filled with anxiety  
Frustration, one right note a day  
Where to find a perfect tune  
Just do the work and take a step back  
All the joy unforgiven by this task  
An errant soul, homeless and foul  
All gone but the will to live to tell the tale  
Dark chambers of my mind  
Locked around the neck of my love  
None of you understand and it doesn't matter  
To a broken marionette like me  
(Me)  
An errant soul, homeless and foul  
An errant soul, homeless and foul  
All gone but the will to live to tell the, to tell the tale  

Trees have dropped their leaves,  
Clouds their waters  
All this burden is killing me  
  
Distance is covering your way,  
Tears your memory  
All this beauty is killing me  
  
Oh, do you care,  
I still feel for you  
So aware,  
What should be lost is there  
  
I fear I will never find anyone  
I know my greatest pain is yet to come  
Will we find each other in the dark  
My long lost love

Who the hell are you to tell me  
What to do, why to do, why bother  
Leech in a mask of virtue  
Such waste, to ever think of you again  
  
Hey Judas, your Christess was our love  
Hit and run, your will be done  
Never sorry, never wrong  
More more more more more  
  
Master passion greed  
  
?Hello. How are you?  
Let me explain one thing.  
All for her and more for me  
Why is it so hard to see?  
I see no sense in doing this  
Not enough for me  
I fuck up everything but let me explain.?  
  
Some day you shall flee,  
Panting and weak  
  
Master passion greed  
  
All within me gone but pain and hope  
Hoping that the pain would fade away  
  
Greed, your master passion  
I Feed the mouth that bites me  
Mammon, opiate of the masses  
The reek of your lies draws flies  
  
Seek her  
Seduce her  
Tame her  
Blame her  
Have her  
Kill her  
Feast on it all  
  
With awakening the tears will begin  
To my everlasting shame silence took me

I climbed off your back  
Not so long ago  
To a blooming meadow  
To a path you'd made for the lightest feet  
  
Mother, I am always close to you  
I will be waving every time you leave  
Oh, I am you, the care, the love, the memories  
We are the story of one  
  
Father, I am always close to you  
I will be waving every time you leave  
Oh, I am you, the care, the love, the memories  
You are forever in me  
  
This verse we wrote on our road home  
For you, all this for you  
All this for you  
  
Our walk has been sublime  
A soaring ride and gentle leap  
You have the heart of a true friend  
One day we'll meet on that shore again  
  
Mother, I am always close to you  
I will be waving every time you leave  
Oh, I am you, the care, the love, the memories  
We are the story of one  
  
Oh father, I am always close to you  
I will be waving every time you leave  
Oh, I am you, the care, the love, the memories  
You are forever in me

The deepest solace lies in understanding  
This ancient unseen stream  
A shudder before the beautiful  
  
Awake Oceanborn  
Behold this force  
Bring the outside in  
Explore the self to epiphany  
  
The very core of life  
Is soaring higher of truth and light  
  
The music of this all  
Deep silence between the notes  
Deafens me with endless love  
This vagrant island Earth  
A pilgrim shining bright  
We are shuddering  
Before the beautiful  
Before the plentiful  
We're the voyagers  
  
Tales from the seas  
Cathedral of greed  
  
The very core of life  
Is soaring higher of truth and light  
  
The music of this all  
Deep silence between the notes  
Deafens me with endless love  
This vagrant island Earth  
A pilgrim shining bright  
We are shuddering  
Before the beautiful  
Before the plentiful  
We're the voyagers  
  
The unknown  
The grand show  
The choir of the stars  
Interstellar  
Theatre play  
The nebula curtain falls  
Imagination  
Evolution  
A species from the veil  
As we wander  
In search of  
The source of the tale  
  
The music of this all  
Deep silence between the notes  
Deafens me with endless love  
This vagrant island Earth  
A pilgrim shining bright  
We are shuddering  
Before the beautiful  
Before the plentiful  
We're the voyagers

I'm a priest for the poorest sacrifice  
I'm but a raft in a sea of sorrow and greed  
You bathed in my wine  
Drank from my cup, mocked my rhyme  
Your slit tongues licked my aching wounds  
  
Put a stake through my heart!  
And drag me into sunlight  
So awake for your greed  
As you're slaying the dreamer  
  
Swansong for the Wish of Night  
God it hurts, give a name to the pain  
Our primrose path to hell is growing weed  
  
Blame me, it's me  
Coward, a good for nothing scapegoat  
Dumb kid, living a dream  
Romantic only on paper  
  
Tell me why you took all that was mine!  
Stay as you lay don't lead me astray!  
  
Wake up, mow the weed  
You'd be nothing without me  
Take my life if you have the heart to die  
  
You bastards tainted my tool  
Raped my words, played me a fool  
Gather your precious glitter and leave me be  
The Great Ones are all dead  
And I'm tired, too  
  
I truly hate you all!

The sun is sleeping quietly  
Once upon a century  
Wistful oceans calm and red  
Ardent caresses laid to rest  
  
For my dreams I hold my life  
For wishes I behold my night  
The truth at the end of time  
Losing faith makes a crime  
  
I wish for this night-time  
to last for a lifetime  
The darkness around me  
Shores of a solar sea  
Oh how I wish to go down with the sun  
Sleeping  
Weeping  
With you  
  
Sorrow has a human heart  
From my god it will depart  
I'd sail before a thousand moons  
Never finding where to go  
  
Two hundred twenty-two days of light  
Will be desired by a night  
A moment for the poet's play  
Until there's nothing left to say  
  
I wish for this night-time  
  
I wish for this night-time

Close your eyes  
Feel the ocean where passion lies  
Silently the senses  
Abandon all defenses  
  
A place between sleep and awake  
End of innocence, unending masquerade  
That's where I'll wait for you  
  
Hold me near you  
So close I sear you  
Seeing, believing  
Dreaming, deceiving  
  
A place between sleep and awake  
End of innocence, unending masquerade  
That's where I'll wait for you  
  
Sleepwalker seducing me  
I dare to enter your ecstasy  
Lay yourself now down to sleep  
In my dreams you're mine to keep  
  
(Sleepwalk with me)  
  
Sleepwalker seducing me

Come and share  
This painting with me  
Unveiling of me,  
The magician that never failed  
  
This deep sigh  
Cover all my chest  
Intoxicated by  
A major chord  
  
I wonder do I love you?  
  
Slow love slow  
Only the weak  
Are not lonely  
  
Southern blue  
Morning dew  
Let down your guards  
I love you  
Ice cream castels  
Lips to ear rhymes  
A slumber deeper than time  
  
Slow love slow  
Only the weak  
Are not lonely  
  
Sloooow slow love slow  
Slow love slooooooow  
Slow slow hum hooo hum huuuuum

It was the night before,  
When all through the world,  
No words, no dreams  
Then one day,  
A writer by a fire  
Imagined all of Gaia  
Took a journey into a child-man's heart  
  
A painter on the shore  
Imagined all the world  
Within a snowflake on his palm  
Unframed by poetry,  
A canvas of awe  
Planet Earth falling back into the stars  
  
I am the voice of Never-never-land,  
The innocence, the dreams of every man,  
I am the empty crib of Peter Pan,  
A silent kite against the blue, blue sky,  
Every chimney, every moonlit sight  
I am the story that will read you real,  
Every memory that you hold dear  
  
I am the journey,  
I am the destination,  
I am the home  
The tale that reads you  
A way to taste the night  
The elusive high  
Follow the madness  
Alice, you know once did  
  
Imaginarium, a dream emporium!  
Caress the tales  
And they will read you real  
A storyteller's game,  
Lips that intoxicate  
The core of all life is a  
Limitless chest of tales  
  
I am the voice of Never-never-land  
The innocence, the dreams of every man,  
I am the empty crib of Peter Pan,  
A silent kite against the blue, blue sky,  
Every chimney, every moonlit sight  
I am the story that will read you real,  
Every memory that you hold dear  
  
I am the voice of Never-never-land  
The innocence, the dreams from every man,  
Searching heavens for another earth  
  
I am the voice of Never-never-land  
The innocence, the dreams of every man,  
I am the empty crib of Peter Pan,  
A silent kite against the blue, blue sky,  
Every chimney, every moonlit sight  
I am the story that will read you real,  
Every memory that you hold dear  
  
I am the voice of Never-never-land  
The innocence, the dreams of every man,  
I am the empty crib of Peter Pan,  
A silent kite against the blue, blue sky,  
Every chimney, every moonlit sight  
I am the story that will read you real,  
Every memory that you hold dear

All those beautiful people  
I want to have them all  
All those porcelain models  
If only I could make them fall  
  
Be my heart a well of love  
Flowing free so far above  
  
A wintry eve  
Once upon a tale  
An Ugly Duckling  
Lost in a verse  
Of a sparrows carol  
Dreaming the stars  
  
Be my heart a well of love  
Flowing free so far above  
  
In my world  
Love is for poets  
Never the famous balcony scene  
Just a dying faith  
On the heaven's gate  
  
Crystal pond awaits the lorn  
Tonight another morn for the lonely one is born

Who are you?  
Man condemned to shine a salvation  
Throughout the centuries  
  
Why?  
Was the wine of the grail  
Too sour for man to drink  
  
The carpenter  
Carved his anchor  
On the dying souls of mankind  
On the tomb of this unknown soldier  
Lay the tools of the one who for us had died  
Tools of the carpenter  
  
The one they lick  
The same old sick  
Dream of their precious savior  
  
Kiss them deep  
And make them weep  
Over promises of eternal peace  
  
The carpenter  
Carved his anchor  
On the dying souls of mankind  
On the tomb of this unknown soldier  
Lay the tools of the one who for us had died  
Tools of the carpenter  
  
I hear you  
Through the symphonic voices of nature  
The purity I could never doubt  
They tell me to lie on the grass  
And observe my savior  
The one crucified to the chirping of birds  
  
The carpenter  
Carved his anchor  
On the dying souls of mankind  
On the tomb of this unknown soldier  
Lay the tools of the one who for us had died  
Tools of the carpenter

Who's there knocking at my window?  
The owl and the Dead Boy  
This night whispers my name  
All the dying children  
  
Virgin snow beneath my feet  
Painting the world in white  
I tread the way and lose myself into a tale  
  
Come hell or high water  
My search will go on  
Clayborn Voyage without an end  
  
A nightingale in a golden cage  
That's me locked inside reality's maze  
Come someone make my heavy heart light  
Come undone, bring me back to life  
It all starts with a lullaby  
  
Journey homeward bound  
A sound of a dolphin calling  
Tearing off the mask of man  
The tower, my sole guide  
  
This is who I am  
Escapist, paradise seeker  
Farewell, now time to fly  
Out of sight, out of time, away from all lies  
  
A nightingale in a golden cage  
That's me locked inside reality's maze  
Come someone make my heavy heart light  
Come undone, bring me back to life  
It all starts with a lullaby

The ticktock of time allows me to see  
An owl turn to an echo  
The butterfly to a cocoon  
A swan to ugly duckling  
A lake to an ocean  
  
The dead times awake  
As I've been called myself to yesterday  
The flower has fallen it's petals  
Out of the petals a cradle I will  
  
My cradle rocks with the waves of time  
The time of beauty will never be the same  
Oh, little girl, as thou must now leave  
Please take me, take me with thee  
  
Now I hear my mother from the deep  
Sing me a lullaby of eternal sleep  
Wilt blow wee plant that last to recall  
As in silence we sing to reborn

Silent night surrounding me  
On the shore of wistful sea  
A kindest heart made me believe  
The world as I wish it to be  
  
Wind in the wheat  
Kiss by a hearth  
Little hideaways for a lonely heart  
  
Cast away in beauty's gloom  
The good in me, the child within  
A cruelest heart made me forget  
The world as I wish it to be  
  
Home inside but lost for life  
Human heart longing for love  
Slave to the toil, this mortal coil  
The strife, the suffering, the void  
  
Wind in the wheat  
Kiss by a hearth  
A dead calm winter morn,  
Morning birds, and a smile of a stranger  
  
Frozen moments in time  
Little hideaways, the marrow of life  
Little hideaways for a lonely heart  
  
Wind in the wheat  
Kiss by a hearth  
Little hideaways for a lonely heart  
  
Silent night surrounding me  
On the shore of wistful sea  
A kindest heart made me believe  
The world as I wish it to be.

For whom the gun tolls  
For whom the prey weeps  
Bow before a war  
Call it religion  
  
Some wounds never heal  
Some tears never will  
Dry for the unkind  
Cry for mankind  
  
Even the dead cry  
Their only comfort  
Kill your friend, I don't care  
Orchid kids, blinded stare  
  
Need to understand  
No need to forgive  
No truth no sense left to be followed  
  
Facing this unbearable fear  
like meeting an old friend  
  
"Time to die, poor mates,  
You made me what I am!"  
  
In this world of a million religions  
everyone prays the same way  
  
"Your praying is in vain  
It'll all be over soon"  
  
Father help me, save me a place by your side!  
  
"There is no God Our creed is but for ourselves"  
"Not a hero unless you die Our species eat the wounded ones"  
  
Drunk with the blood of your victims  
I do feel your pity-wanting pain,  
Lust for fame, a deadly game  
  
"Run away with your impeccable kin!"  
  
"Good wombs hath borne bad sons"  
  
Cursing, God, why?  
Falling for every lie  
Survivors' guilt  
In us forevermore  
  
Fifteen candles  
Redeemers of this world  
Dwell in hypocrisy:  
"How were we supposed to know?"  
  
Four pink ones  
Nine blue ones  
Two black ones

The end  
  
The songwriter?s dead  
The blade fell upon him  
Taking him to the white lands  
Of Empathica,  
Of Innocence  
Empathica  
Innocence  
  
The dreamer and the wine  
Poet without a rhyme  
A widowed writer, torn apart by chains of Hell  
  
One last perfect verse  
Yet still the same old song  
Oh Christ, how I hate what I have become  
Take me home  
  
Get away, run away, fly away  
Lead me astray, to dreamer?s hideaway  
I cannot cry ?cause the shoulder cries more  
I cannot die, I, the whore for the cold world  
Forgive me, I have but two faces  
One for the world,  
One for God save me  
I cannot cry ?cause the shoulder cries more  
I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world  
  
My home was there and then  
These meadows of heaven  
Adventure-filled days  
One with every smiling face  
  
Please, no more words  
Thoughts from a severed head  
No more praise  
Tell me once my heart goes right  
Take me home  
  
Get away, run away, fly away  
Lead me astray, to dreamer?s hideaway  
I cannot cry ?cause the shoulder cries more  
I cannot die, I, the whore for the cold world  
Forgive me, I have but two faces  
One for the world,  
One for God save me  
I cannot cry ?cause the shoulder cries more  
I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world  
Whore for the cold world  
Whore for the cold world  
  
Sparkle my scenery  
With turquoise waterfall  
With beauty underneath  
The Ever Free  
  
Tuck me in  
Beneath the blue  
Beneath the pain  
Beneath the rain  
Goodnight kiss for a child in time  
Swaying blade my lullaby  
  
On the shore we sat and hoped  
Under the same pale moon  
Whose guiding light chose you  
Chose you all  
  
I?m afraid, so afraid, of being raped  
Again and again and again  
I know I will die alone, but loved  
You live long enough to hear the sound of guns  
Long enough to find yourself screaming every night  
And if you want  
Live long enough to see your friends betray you  
Years have I been strapped unto this altar  
Now I only have three minutes and counting  
I just wish the tide would catch me first  
And give me a death  
I always longed for  
  
Second robber to the right of Christ  
Cut in half - infacticide  
The world will rejoice today  
As the crows feast on the rotting poet  
  
Everyone must bury their own  
No pack to bury the heart of stone  
Now he's home in Hell, serves him well  
Slain by the bell, tolling for his farewell  
  
The morning dawned upon this altar  
Remains of the dark passion play  
Performed by his friends without shame  
Spitting on his grave as they came  
  
Get away, run away, fly away  
Lead me astray, to dreamer?s hideaway  
I cannot cry ?cause the shoulder cries more  
I cannot die, I, the whore for the cold world  
Forgive me, I have but two faces  
One for the world,  
One for God save me  
I cannot cry ?cause the shoulder cries more  
I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world  
A whore for the cold world  
A whore for the cold world  
  
Today, in the year of our Lord, 2005  
Thomas was called from the cares of the world  
He stopped crying at the end of each beautiful day  
The music he wrote had too long been without silence  
He was found naked and dead  
With a smile in his face, a pen and 1000 pages of erased text  
  
Save me!  
  
Be still, my son  
You're home  
Oh when did you become so cold?  
The blade will keep on descending  
All you need is to feel my love  
  
Search for beauty, find your shore  
Try to save them all, bleed no more  
You have such ocean's within  
In the end  
I will always love you  
  
The beginning

A kite above a graveyard grey  
At the end of the line far far away  
A child holding on to the magic of birth and awe  
  
Oh, how beautiful it used to be  
Just you and me far beyond the sea  
The waters, scarce in motion  
Quivering still  
  
At the end of the river the sundown beams  
All the relics of a life long lived  
Here, weary traveler rest your wand  
Sleep the journey from your eyes  
  
Good journey, love, time to go  
I checked your teeth and warmed your toes  
In the horizon I see them coming for you  
  
The mermaid grace, the forever call  
Beauty in spyglass on an old man's porch  
The mermaids you turn loose brought back your tears  
  
[4x]  
At the end of the river the sundown beams  
All the relics of a life long lived  
Here, weary traveler rest your wand  
Sleep the journey from your eyes

As the sun sets beyond the pyramids  
To greet me with its rays  
I place my hand on my forehead  
To see your chariots' flames  
  
Watch me kneel before you  
Hear the cats meowing in the temple  
They yearn the milk you cascaded  
As I yearn that promised treasure  
  
[Chorus]  
Treasure of  
Tutankhamen  
I am the one it is  
Take me with you  
Through the stargate  
To the valley of the kings  
  
Sacrifice me  
Tutankhamen  
And let me be your queen  
Take me  
Tonight and always  
We'll breed to fill all earth  
  
Three milleniums it took me to guard your rest  
Your slumber in mighty Phoenix's nest  
But tonight the darkness in the tomb has perished  
For Carter has come to free my beloved  
  
[Chorus]

Sleep Eden sleep  
My fallen son  
Slumber in peace  
  
Cease the pain  
Life's just in vain  
For us to gain  
Nothing but all the same  
  
No healing hand  
For your disease  
Drinking scorn like water  
Cascading with my tears  
  
Beneath the candle bed  
Two saddened angels, in heaven, in death  
  
Now let us lie  
Sad we lived sad we die  
Even in your pride  
I never blamed you  
  
A mother's love  
Is a sacrifice  
Together sleeping  
Keeping it all  
  
No sympathy  
No eternity  
One light for each undeserved tear  
  
Beneath the candle bed  
Two souls with everything yet to be said

Lonely nights I think of you  
My life, my king and my land  
Land of war will turn into light  
Divine light will give us strength  
  
Sunlight divine cover my land  
Angels of light take care of us  
  
Still darkness surrounds myself  
Among the trees I saw the gates of hell  
I hear that someone screams my name  
Devil claims for my life  
  
Sunlight divine give me the strength  
Angels of light show me the way  
  
Flying up in the sky, riding through the wind  
Until dawn things won't change at all  
Strange sensations, fighting the evil in my heart  
Angels of light help me save my land  
  
Stars guide me in this night  
Light my way to fight the dark  
God, I pray to you one more time  
With your help I'll save my land  
  
Sunlight divine cover my land  
Angels of light take care of us  
  
Flying up in the sky, riding through the wind  
Until dawn things won't change at all  
Strange sensations, fighting the evil in my heart  
Angels of light help me save my land

We're walking in the air  
We're floating in the moonlit sky  
The people far below are sleeping as we fly  
  
I'm holding very tight  
I'm riding in the midnight blue  
I'm finding I can fly so high above with you  
  
Far across the wold  
The villages go by like trees  
The rivers and the hills  
The forests and the streams  
  
Children gaze open mouth  
Taken by surprise  
Nobody down below believes their eyes  
  
We're surfing in the air  
We're swimming in the frozen sky  
We're drifting over icy  
Mountains floating by  
  
Suddenly swooping low on an ocean deep  
Arousing of a mighty monster from its sleep  
  
We're walking in the air  
We're floating in the midnight sky  
And everyone who sees us greets us as we fly

I want to see where the sirens sing  
Hear how the wolves howl  
Sail the dead calm waters of the pacific  
  
Dance in the fields of coral  
Be blinded by the white  
Discover the deepest jungle  
  
I want to find the secret path  
A bird delivered into my heart, so  
  
It's not the end  
Not the kingdom come  
It is the journey that matters, the distant wanderer  
Call of the wild  
In me forever and ever and ever forever  
Wanderlust  
  
I want to love by the blue lagoon  
Kiss under the waning moon  
Straying, claiming my place in this mortal coil  
  
Riding the dolphins  
Asking the mountains  
Dreaming Alaska  
The earth can have but earth  
  
I want to find  
  
It's not the end  
  
Look into my eyes and see the wanderer  
See the mirrors of a wolf behold the pathfinder

Still  
Spinning 'round in my head  
How I regret everything that I said  
Why did I tell you to go?  
Saving my pride but losing my soul  
  
I'm here all alone  
Still wait by the phone  
The hours go by  
What else could I do but to cry  
  
I call, and I call  
Just to make things right  
Have I lost the fight?  
Where were you last night?  
  
I beg, and I cry  
I keep asking why  
Where were you last night?  
Where were you last night?  
  
Lost  
In the dark and my fears  
If only you saw the tracks of my tears  
I think I'm losing my mind  
Where did you go, and what did you find?  
  
I'm here all alone  
Still wait by the phone  
The hours go by  
What else could I do but to cry?  
  
I call, and I call  
Just to make things right  
Have I lost the fight?  
Where were you last night?  
  
I beg, and I cry  
I keep asking why  
Where were you last night?  
Where were you last night?  
  
I call, and I call  
Just to make things right  
Have I lost the fight?  
Where were you last night?  
  
I beg, and I cry  
I keep asking why  
Where were you last night?  
Where were you last night?  
  
I'm here all alone  
Still wait by the phone  
The hours go by  
What else could I do but to cry?  
  
I call, and I call  
Just to make things right  
Have I lost the fight?  
Where were you last night?  
  
I call, and I call  
Just to make things right  
  
I call, and I call  
Just to make things right  
Have I lost the fight?  
Where were you last night?  
  
I beg, and I cry  
I keep asking why  
Where were you last night?  
Where were you last night?  
  
Where were you last night?  
Where were you last night?  
  
I call, and I call  
Just to make things right  
Have I lost the fight?  
Where were you last night?  
  
I beg, and I cry  
I keep asking why  
Where were you last night?  
Where were you last night?  
  
I call, and I call  
Just to make things right  
Have I lost the fight?  
Where were you last night?

Sweet little words made for silence not talk  
Young heart for love not heartache  
Dark hair for catching the wind  
Not to veil the sight of a cold world  
  
Kiss while your lips are still red  
While he's still silent  
Rest while bosom is still untouched, unveiled  
Hold another hand while the hand's still without a tool  
Drown into eyes while they're still blind  
Love while the night still hides the withering dawn  
  
First day of love never comes back  
A passionate hour's never a wasted one  
The violin, the poet's hand  
Every thawing heart plays your theme with care  
  
Kiss while your lips are still red  
While he's still silent  
Rest while bosom is still untouched, unveiled  
Hold another hand while the hand's still without a tool  
Drown into eyes while they're still blind  
Love while the night still hides the withering dawn  
  
Kiss while your lips are still red  
While he's still silent  
Rest while bosom is still untouched, unveiled  
Hold another hand while the hand's still without a tool  
Drown into eyes while they're still blind  
Love while the night still hides the withering dawn  
Love while the night still hides the withering dawn

We seduce the dark with pain and rapture  
Like two ships that pass in the night  
You and I, a whore and a bashful sailor  
Welcome to a sunrise of a dirty mind  
  
All your love is a lie  
You one-night butterfly  
Hurt me, be the one  
Whoever brings the night  
  
The dark, created to hide the innocent white, the lust of night  
Eyes so bright, seductive lies  
Crimson masquerade where I merely played my part  
Poison dart of desire  
  
All your love is a lie  
You one-night butterfly  
Hurt me, be the one  
Whoever brings the night  
  
Choose a bride tonight  
A fantasy for a zombie  
Hurt me, I love to suffer  
Your harems are dreams for free  
  
Enter  
Suck form us and live for ever  
Rotten beauty  
Will haunt you for a lifetime  
  
Come with me on underwater  
And drown to despise me no more  
Unholy, unworthy  
My night is a dream for free  
  
All your love is a lie  
You one-night butterfly  
Hurt me, be the one  
Whoever brings the night  
All your love is a lie  
You one-night butterfly  
Hurt me, be the one  
  
Whoever brings the night  
Whoever brings the night

Wish you were here  
Me oh my country man  
Wish you were here  
  
I wish you were here  
Don't you know the snow is getting colder?  
And I miss you like hell  
And I'm feeling blue  
  
Wish you were here  
Me oh my country man  
Wish you were here  
(Wish you were here)  
  
Wish you were here  
Don't you know the snow is getting colder?  
And I miss you like hell  
And I'm feeling blue  
  
I've got feelings for you  
Do you still feel the same?  
From the first time I laid my eyes on you  
Felt the joy of living  
I saw heaven in your eyes  
In your eyes  
  
Wish you were here  
Me oh my country man  
Wish you were here  
(Wish you here)  
  
I wish you were here  
Don't you know the snow is getting colder?  
And I miss you like hell  
And I'm feeling blue  
  
I miss your laugh  
I miss your smile  
I miss everything about you  
Every second is like a minute  
Every minute's like a day  
When you're far away  
  
(The snow is getting colder and I wish you were here)  
(A battlefield of love and fear, and I wish you were here)  
  
I've got feelings for you  
From the first time I laid my eyes on you  
  
Wish you were here  
Me oh my country man  
Wish you were here  
(Wish you were here)  
  
I wish you were here  
Don't you know the snow is getting colder?  
And I miss you like hell  
And I'm feeling blue  
  
(Wish you were here)  
(I wish you were here)

Master!  
Apprentice!  
Heartborne, 7th Seeker  
Warrior!  
Disciple!  
In me the Wishmaster  
  
Elbereth  
Lorien  
  
A dreamy-eyed child staring into night  
On a journey to storyteller's mind  
Whispers a wish speaks with the stars the words are silent in him  
Distant sigh from a lonely heart  
"I'll be with you soon, my Shalafi"  
Grey Havens my destiny  
  
Master!...  
  
Silvara  
Starbreeze  
  
Sla-Mori the one known only by Him  
To august realms, the sorcery within  
If you hear the call of arcane lore,  
Your world shall rest on Earth no more  
A maiden elf calling with her cunning song  
"Meet me at the Inn of Last Home"  
Heartborne will find the way!  
  
Master!...  
  
Wishmaster  
Crusade for Your will  
A child, dreamfinder  
The Apprentice becoming...  
  
Master!...

Tear me to bits enjoy the scene  
Of screen name verbal vanity  
Churning the words embued in filth  
Your tongue oily water under my bridge  
  
You have the world  
It's all for you  
I wish you'd find the lost in you  
Grateful for the pain  
It proves we're alive  
Can you feel it?  
  
I can't make you want the truth  
It's up to you!  
  
Yours is an empty hope  
Yours is an empty hope  
  
Feed me to pigs in your fantasies  
Your sea roars bitter elegies  
Like narcissus who bribes the pool  
A hollow voice, ruin with a roof  
  
Stop! Life is now, still all for you  
Turn from the hate  
Turn from the smoke  
I see the parchment of your soul  
The note, the song  
Join your voice  
  
I can't let you have the world  
It's all for you!  
  
Yours is an empty hope  
Yours is an empty hope
