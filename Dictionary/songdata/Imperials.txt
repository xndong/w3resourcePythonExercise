[Verse 1]  
Surrounded by the cares of Life  
Situations rise, they press against my soul  
Desperate thoughts have blocked me in  
Feels like I may lose control  
  
A voice from somewhere inside of me  
Brings comfort and fills my heart with courage  
And lets me know that everything will be alright  
  
[Chorus]  
(I hear Him say)  
Be still my soul and know that He is God  
(He is God)  
Stand quitely - He is the Lord  
If God is for me who can be against me?  
(He is God)  
Be still my soul, He is the Lord  
  
[Verse 2]  
Teach me Lord, to stay with You  
When my emotions try to rule me  
Remind me Lord, of who I am  
Show me, what You want me to be  
  
In His great strength and confidence  
Knowing that You are with me  
I'm not afraid of tomorrow  
What waits ahead  
  
[Chorus]  
(I hear Him say)  
Be still, my soul, and know that He is God  
(He is God)  
Stand quitely - He is the Lord  
If God is for me who can be against me?  
(He is God)  
Be still my soul, He is the Lord  
  
Be still my soul, He is the Lord  
He is the Lord.

You spoke the words and all the worlds came into order  
You waved your hands and planets filled the empty skies  
You placed the woman and the man inside the garden  
And though they fell they found compassion in your eyes  
  
Bridge:  
Oh Lord I stand amazed at the wonder of it all  
And yet a greater wonder brings me to my knees  
  
Chorus:  
Lord I praise you, because of who you are  
Not for all the mighty deeds that you have done  
Lord I worship you, because of who you are  
It's all the reason that I need to voice my praise  
Because of who you are  
  
One holy night you sent your promise from a virgin  
And promise grew as you revealed to us your heart  
Enduring love displayed through out your crucifixion  
And in your death, you tore the darkened grave apart  
  
[Bridge:]  
  
[Chorus 2x]

Seasons come and seasons go  
But still the world she be turnin'  
I often stop and wonder  
How long will God  
Keep the fire burnin'  
Sometimes it seems the world's gone mad  
But I know there's hope for our children  
'Cause Jesus told us what to do  
And I know now's not the time to give in  
  
Long as we have breath  
Let's keep pushing  
Fighting to the death  
Stop at nothing  
His never ending flame  
Keep it burning Ooh  
Long as the big ball  
Long as the big ball is turning  
  
Time to feed the hungry heart  
That's never tasted compassion  
It's the time to spread the word  
Hey there's a love that is everlasting  
Yellow line down an upon road  
Don't say where she's going  
Still we follow just the same  
Oh, there is hope of a new horizon  
  
Long as we have breath  
Let's keep pushing  
Fighting to the death  
Stop at nothing  
His never ending flame  
Keep it burning Ooh  
Long as the big ball  
Long as the big ball is turning  
  
Round and round and round it goes  
But God is in control  
He knows just where we're going  
Yes the future's in His hands  
I don't know when we will land  
Oh no  
But I'll keep right on trusting in the Master's plan  
  
Long as we have breath  
Let's keep pushing  
Fighting to the death  
Stop at nothing  
His never ending flame  
Keep it burning Ooh  
Long as the big ball  
Long as the big ball is turning

My God's a big God  
He walks among the mountains  
My God's a big God  
He rises from the sea my God's a big God  
The stars surround his shoulders  
My God's a big God but small enough to live in me  
  
My God's a strong God he made the mighty mountains  
My God's a strong God but he holds me gently in his hands  
  
My God's a loud God his fingers snap like thunder  
My God's a loud God he rocks the hemisphere  
My God's a loud God he echoes through the ages  
My God's a loud God but he whispers softly in my ear  
  
My God's a big God he walks among the mountains  
My God's a big God he rises from the sea  
My God's a big God the stars surround his shoulders  
My God's a big God but small enough to live in me  
  
My God's a strong God he made the mighty mountains  
My God's a strong God but he holds me gently in his hands  
My Gods a loud God his fingers snap like thunder  
My God's a loud God he rocks the hemisphere  
My God's a loud God he echoes through the ages  
My God's a loud God but he whispers softly in my ear  
  
Chorus

Well there are people  
Never receiving  
Anything from God at all  
Oh, they are shaken  
From their believing  
When they don't see results  
They quickly fall  
  
But don't you waver  
Keep on living  
In the way God wants you to  
Don't get discouraged  
Keep on giving  
Soon it will come back to you  
  
Chorus:  
Keep on casting  
Your bread upon the water  
Soon it's gonna come back home on every wave  
Keep on casting  
Your bread upon the water  
Soon it's gonna come back home on every wave  
Good measure pressed down  
Shaken together running over  
Soon it's gonna come back home on every wave  
  
Keep on working  
Seeking the kingdom  
Instead of working for your needs  
Keep on sharing the love of Jesus  
You know, growing comes from planting seeds  
  
Chorus

No this isn't easy  
But I can't keep runnin' from Your love  
I've been denying' way too long  
That there's something deep inside me  
That takes me down the road that leads me to Your door  
I know that I belong there with You  
My human nature would keep me far away  
But God I really need You  
I'm asking You to stay  
  
Chorus:  
Come into my life  
Change this heart forever  
Let me feel the healing' in Your touch  
Take all my hurt away  
Come into my life  
I surrender all my feelings  
You've got the love I've needed all along  
Lord, I pray that You will  
Come into my life  
  
Oh I'm through pretending  
That I've got everything a man could ever need  
You know I'm tired of the lie  
Yeah, I was so independent  
But independence never calmed my soul at night  
Now I close my eyes and peace consumes me  
Your love has shown me  
What it is I need to be  
And when I least expect it  
Love becomes more real  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh, I ran from You so long  
Never could leave Your touch  
You loved me day by day  
Never leaving' a doubt  
So, now I'm tired of this fight  
And I need Your strength tonight  
You see I've never been as ready as I am right now  
  
Chorus

Chorus:  
Free the fire in me  
Let it be  
Ignited in power  
Let me be  
Ablaze in this hour  
Like a torch that's passed for eternity  
So free the fire in me  
Let it show  
Like glowing devotion  
Let it go  
Like flames hot in motion  
For the world set is my burning desire  
So free the fire in me  
  
A man's true temperature is tested by his wealth  
Love only flickers if it's just to warm himself  
My treasure lies in you and fans the zeal of all I do  
It's rising and growing  
It can't be shared with just a few  
Everybody needs the light  
In my heart it's always burning bright  
So let the heat climb ever higher  
And free the fire in me  
  
Chorus  
  
All by myself I don't know where I could begin  
I'm just a spark the quenches like a candle kindles in the wind  
Not by my ability  
But only by his spirit can it be  
I'll do all that you require  
And free the fire in me  
  
Chorus

Too many times I find myself thinking  
I'm the only one who knows  
What it's like to need someone  
And how it feels to be alone  
Forgetting you're watching even if I look away  
Then you show me, I'm not really on my own  
  
Chorus:  
I can't always see you  
But I know you are there  
In the quiet ways you talk to me  
I can tell you're near  
You love me even when I'm not aware  
I can't always see you, but I know you are there  
  
So many times I know you're speaking  
And although I may not hear  
All the things you have to say  
In my heart you make it clear  
That you'll never leave me even though I turn away  
And you show me, I don't have to be afraid  
  
Chorus  
  
And I remember how your love was so real  
And how you changed my life completely  
  
Chorus (2x)  
  
I can't always see you, but I know you are there

I got another phone call, a caring friend or two,  
They say they have the answers for what I'm going through,  
But they don't understand that their ways just won't work for me,  
I've got a Lord, who knows my heart, and meets my every need.  
  
Chorus:  
Yes Lord, I'd rather believe in You. Yes Lord I'd rather believe in You.  
You've always kept your promises, Your Love has never failed.  
That's why I know I'd rather believe in You.  
  
I saw the morning paper, "Hope is lost at sea."  
Fear's the motivator, but where can the victory be?  
Although the signs of troubled times are tempting to receive,  
I'd rather trust in the Good News that my Jesus said believe!  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh, don't you know, that our crying time is near?  
But Jesus is closer! And he dries up ever tear!  
  
Chorus

Chorus:  
It is no secret what god can do.  
What he's done for others, he'll do for you.  
With arms wide open, he'll pardon you.  
It is no secret what god can do.  
  
The chimes of time ring out the news,  
Another day is through.  
Someone slipped and fell.  
Was that someone you?  
You may have longed for added strength,  
Your courage to renew.  
Do not be disheartened,  
For I bring hope to you.  
  
Chorus  
  
There is no night for in his light  
You never walk alone.  
Always feel at home,  
Wherever you may go.  
There is no power can conquer you  
While god is on your side.  
Take him at his promise,  
Don't run away and hide.  
  
Chorus

There's a storm on the horizon,  
Oh, let the wind blow,  
There is thunder in the heavens,  
Oh, let the wind blow,  
Let the rain fall down from the sky above,  
Let the tempest roar 'til it's had enough,  
I'm trusting in the Lord of love,  
Let the wind blow.  
  
There is lightning in the distance,  
Oh, let the wind blow,  
There is darkness all around me,  
Oh, let the wind blow,  
Let the world give all the hurt it can,  
Let the evil one devise his plans,  
I'm trusting in the great I am,  
Let the wind blow.  
  
Let the wind blow... Blow as hard as it can,  
Let the wind blow,  
Upon the solid rock of God I stand,  
Oh, let the wind blow.  
  
There's a storm on the horizon,  
Oh, let the wind blow,  
There is thunder in the heavens,  
Oh, let the wind blow,  
Let it's mighty fury be unleashed,  
Let the doubters fall upon their knees,  
I'm trusting in the prince of peace,  
Let the wind blow.  
  
Let the wind blow... Blow as hard as it can,  
Let the wind blow,  
Upon the solid rock of God I stand,  
Oh, let the wind blow.  
  
Let it's mighty fury be unleashed,  
Let the doubters fall upon their knees,  
I'm trusting in the prince of peace,  
Let the wind blow.  
  
Let the wind blow... Blow as hard as it can,  
Let the wind blow,  
Upon the solid rock of God I stand,  
Let the wind blow, the wind blow.  
  
Let the rain fall down from the sky above,  
Let the tempest roar 'til it's had enough, (let the wind blow)  
Let the world give all the hurt it can,  
Let the evil one devise his plans, (let the wind blow)  
Let the rain fall down from the sky above,  
Let the tempest roar 'til it's had enough,  
I'm trusting in the Lord of love,  
Let the wind blow

See the fields, ripe and white as snow  
Up from the seeds of faith we planted long ago  
So many the hearts in season  
With every prayer they've grown  
You have made them ready  
But we must bring them home  
  
Chorus:  
Lord of the harvest place your fire in me  
Servant you need now, servant I will be  
Give me the eyes of your spirit,  
Your heart of compassion to know  
Lord of the harvest, show me where to go  
  
Time like a free wind, so quickly slips away  
Too soon today's tomorrow, too soon yesterday  
So little time for the reaping and the laborers are few  
Lift your head to the fields of white  
The work that you must do  
  
Chorus  
  
Wherever you may lead me  
Lord of the Harvest I'll Go  
  
(Repeat)

[Chorus]  
As long as there is time, and one breath left in me  
There will always be one more song for You  
As long as there is room for one more voice in praise  
And a need for a word of love and truth, to help my brother through  
There'll be one more song for You  
  
[Verse 1]  
You were there with your songs of laughter, words of hope for my fears  
But what are songs when no one will sing them,  
What are words when no one hears  
Everytime was filled with questions, and when I asked, no one knew  
Till I found the answer in You  
  
[Chorus]  
So long as there is time, and one breath left in me  
There will always be one more song for You  
As long as there is room for one more voice in praise  
And a need for a word of love and truth, to help my brother through  
There'll be one more song for You  
  
[Verse 2]  
Love is in the air around me, hope abounds everywhere  
Living life in the arms of Jesus, learning how to really care  
Every day is filled with purpose, all the old is made new  
And I know I owe it all to You  
  
[Chorus]  
So as long as there is time, and one breath left in me  
There will always be one more song for You  
And as long as there is room for one more voice in praise  
And a need for a word of love and truth, to help my brother through  
There'll be one more song for You  
  
[Outro x4]  
There will always be one more song for You

What can move a man to dance  
When he doesn't hear a band?  
What can move a broken heart to sing?  
What can make a weary sinner  
Fall down on his knees?  
What can make the halls of Heaven ring?  
What can lift my lowest thoughts  
To the very throne of God?  
And what can lift my eyes from earthly things?  
  
Chorus:  
It's the power of praise  
The power of praise  
When led by God's spirit,  
It's a mighty refrain  
It flows with a force  
That carries a current of change  
The power of praise  
  
Praise can give my soul a fire  
When my passion's been consumed  
Praise can give my spirit's song a voice  
Praise can fill my mind with peace  
When doubts have overcome  
Praise can fill my longing to rejoice  
Praise can turn my sorrow  
To a holy celebration  
Praise can turn my weeping  
Into tears of joy  
  
Chorus (2x)

When you're up against a struggle that shatters all your dreams  
And your hopes have been cruelly crushed by Satan's manifested schemes  
And you feel the urge within you to submit to earthly fears  
Don't let the faith you're standing in, seem to disappear  
  
Praise the Lord, He can work through those who praise Him  
Praise the Lord, for our God inhabits praise  
Praise the Lord, for the chains that seems to bind you  
Serve only to remind you that they drop powerless behind you  
When you praise Him  
  
Now Satan is a liar and he wants to make us think, that we are paupers  
When he knows himself we're children of the King  
So lift up the mighty shield of faith for the battle must be won  
We know that Jesus Christ has risen so the work's already done  
  
Praise the Lord, He can work through those who praise Him  
Praise the Lord, for our God inhabits praise  
Praise the Lord, for the chains that seem to bind you  
Serve only to remind you that they drop powerless behind you  
When you praise Him  
  
Praise the Lord, He can work through those who praise Him  
Praise the Lord, for our God inhabits praise  
Praise the Lord, for the chains that seems to bind you  
Serve only to remind you that they drop powerless behind you  
When you praise Him  
  
Praise Him, praise Him  
When you praise Him  
When you praise Him  
When you praise the Lord

Sail on  
When the water gets high  
Sail on  
When the wind starts to die  
Sail on  
It's just a matter of minutes  
Till His ship comes to get us  
And we'll all get in it  
  
When we're all born  
We set out to sea  
Looking for answers continuously  
Then when we find out  
To Him we belong  
We watch for the signs  
And keep sailing on  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Cast up your sails  
And let the wind blow  
Jesus will never  
Let your ship lose control  
Just keep your compass set on the Son  
And He'll guide you safely  
To His beautiful Home  
  
We can't afford to throw our lives  
To the wind  
To the wind  
We've got the Lord  
In control of our ship  
And He'll guide us safely in  
He'll guide us in  
  
[Chorus:]

Chorus:  
  
Sometimes Alleluia,  
Sometimes Praise The Lord  
Sometimes Gently Singing,  
Our Hearts In One Accord  
  
Oh let us lift our voices,  
Look toward the sky and start to sing  
Oh let us now return His love,  
Just let our voices ring  
Oh let us feel His presence,  
Let the sound of praises fill the air  
Oh let us sing the song of Jesus' love,  
To people everywhere.  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh let our joy be unconfined,  
Let us sing with freedom unrestrained  
Let's take this feeling that we're feeling now,  
Outside these walls and let it rain.  
Oh let the Spirit overflow,  
As we are filled from head to toe.  
We love you Father, Son and Holy Ghost,  
And we want this world to know.  
  
Chorus

There is a power,  
Absolute authority that you possess  
For all who receive him,  
Those who will just say "yes"  
Wake up!  
It's time for you to realize just who you are  
You're no more a stranger,  
You are a shinning star  
  
Stand by the power,  
The power of his light  
Now is the hour  
For you to stand by the power  
  
Greater, stronger that any strength the world can find  
Greater than light  
Shinning from deep inside  
Rejoice! Lift your voice for victory already won  
Eternal champions,  
Power to overcome  
  
Stand by the power,  
The power of his light  
Now is the hour  
For you to stand by the power  
  
Stand by the power, power of his light  
Now is the hour for you to stand by,  
Stand by, stand by the power.

Chorus:  
I'm a gonna take a trip  
In the good old gospel ship  
I'm goin' far beyond the sky  
I'm a gonna shout and sing  
Until all the Heavens ring  
When I bid this old world goodbye  
  
I have good news to bring  
And that is why I sing  
All my joys with you I'd like to share  
Oh, I'm a gonna take a trip  
In the good old gospel ship  
And go sailin' through the air.  
  
Chorus  
  
Ooh ah yeah yeah  
  
Oh, I can scarcely wait  
I know I don't wanna be late  
For I want to spend all my time in prayer  
And a when my ship comes in  
I'm a gonna leave this world of sin  
And go sailin' through the air.

I listen to the Trumpet of Jesus  
While the world hears a different sound  
I march to the drumbeat of God Almighty  
While the others just wander around  
I'm a member of the Holy Ghost traveling band  
We're moving on up to a better land  
I hear the voice of the Supernatural singing  
Like only those who know Him can  
  
(Verse 1:)  
One sweet sound makes  
A whole world of difference  
When the world seems indifferent to you  
His Melody of love calls you to be great  
When marking time was all you thought you could do  
So if you've been playing all your days by ear  
Never knowing what your song was to be  
Then pull up a chair, let down your hair  
And take a few lessons from me  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
(Verse 2:)  
A spiritual fanfare has a sound all it's own  
At the birth of a lasting song  
It's been two thousand years since Jesus was born  
And still the celebration goes on  
If you feel the need to get your life in tune  
'Cause you're tired of the derdge every day  
Then turn yourself around,  
Put your feet on the ground  
And just hear what I have to say  
  
[Chorus:]

All around there's hurried confusion  
The cares of life are pressing in  
All through the day,  
They try to steal my faith  
With words that hurt and deeds that block my way  
  
Ah, but that's when I remind myself who's child that I am  
And inside me there is strength to overcome  
And then I speak His name and the tension breaks  
And His love flows as a song to my heart  
  
Chorus  
Whenever I speak His name, I call upon His name  
And all the burdens of my heart... They roll away,  
I just breathe His name... I call upon His name  
And all the cares of this world... They roll away  
If God is for me, who can be against me?  
Whom shall I fear with God on my side?  
You see, Jesus and me, we are a majority...  
And no matter how big the mountain, it'll have to leave,  
  
Oh, so why should I be troubled and have anxiety,  
And let life's little problems bother me?  
Because He lives, I have His strength... And because He is that assures my
victory!  
  
Chorus  
Whenever I speak His name, I call upon His name  
And all the burdens of my heart... They roll away,  
I just breathe His name... I call upon His name  
And all the cares of this world... They roll away  
  
Tag:  
M m m they roll away  
They roll away  
They roll away hey hey  
They roll away  
Whenever I speak His name
