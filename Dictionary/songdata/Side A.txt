Take me to your heart  
Show me where to start  
Let me play the part of your first love  
All the stars are right  
Every wish is ours tonight my love  
  
Maybe those who wait  
Trust in love to fate  
Findin out to late where they lost it  
Never letting go  
They will never know the ways of love  
  
(Chorus)  
You got to believe in magic  
Tell me how do people find each other  
In a world that's full of strangers  
You got to believe in magic  
Something stronger than the moon above  
Cos it's magic when two people fall in love  
  
I may never know  
Why I need you so  
All that is to know is this feeling  
Handle it with care  
We were born to share this dream my love  
  
(Chorus)  
  
Times on our side  
And we always cross our ways  
I guess we're meant to stay  
Don't take the magic away  
  
You got to believe in magic(2x)  
  
(Chorus)  
  
Got to believe... uvvjvcfd

Lying in the gloom  
Of my lonely room  
Thinking of how to reach you  
Dreaming of having you.  
I believe in dreams  
And I believe in miracles  
I believe the toy balloons  
Can reach the moon.  
I don't have the courage and the will  
To say the words  
But I can't feel of what's inside me is for real  
Oh and I know someday  
I'll have the chance to prove and say  
Three simple words would come your way  
I know I have the chance someday  
Coz I believe in dreams.  
And I believe in miracles  
I believe the toy balloons  
Can reach the moon.  
I don't have the courage and the will  
To say the words  
But I can't feel of what's inside me is for real  
Oh and I know someday  
I'll have the chance to prove and say  
Three simple words would come your way  
I know I have the chance someday  
The chance for me to say...  
That I love you...  
Oh I love you...  
Yes I love you...  
Oh I love you...  
I believe in dreams  
I believe my dreams would all come true  
(I believe it will all come true)  
Ooh I believe..  
(I believe it will all come true)  
Ohh I believe..  
(I believe it will all come true)  
Ooh I have faith to believe in dreams...  
(I believe it will all come true)  

If only you can hear me  
I'd let you know, how I miss you so  
Forgive me, I was blind to see  
I was a fool to ever let you go  
Believe in me, I want you to know  
  
[Chorus]  
That I have realized with no one  
Else I'd rather be  
But then I know that you have  
Found yourself somebody new  
Hope I could find you in another  
Place and time  
I've proven it's true  
I'm still in love with you  
  
Every night, I've been dreaming  
About the time when you were mine  
The memories, I will be keeping  
Oh I was so wrong to let our  
Chance go by  
So listen now, I never will deny  
  
[Chorus]  
That I have realized with no one  
Else I'd rather be  
But then I know that you have  
Found yourself somebody new  
Hope I could find you in another  
Place and time  
I've proven it's true  
I'm still in love with you  
  
If only, you can hear me  
I'd let you know, oh how I miss you so  
Believe in me, I want you to know  
  
[Chorus]  
That I have realized with no one  
Else I'd rather be  
But then I know that you have  
Found yourself somebody new  
Hope I could find you in another  
Place and time  
I've proven it's true  
I'm still in love with you [Repeat: x 2]

When you leave me please tell me goodbye  
Please don't go without telling me why  
Cause I would rather be hurt and confused  
I don't wanna read your mind so tell me the truth  
  
Is it anything that I say  
Or is it everything that I do  
Tell me baby cause  
I don't wanna be far from you  
  
I'm trying to make you see  
That you belong to me  
Tell me you'll stay forever  
I love for a while won't do  
I know that this much is true  
I just want to love you  
  
If you need me I'll be by your side  
Always know that I don't have too much pride  
Just remember that I am you long to  
Look into my eyes and you'll find  
It'll always be you  
  
Is it anything that I say  
Or is it everything that I do  
Tell me baby cause  
I don't wanna be far from you  
  
I'm trying to make you see  
That you belong to me  
Tell me you'll stay forever  
I love for a while won't do  
I know that this much is true  
I just want to love you  
  
The time you know my love is for real  
(the time you know is now I feel)  
The time you know for sure  
That I will always care for you  
(I will always care for you)  
  
I'm trying to make you see  
That you belong to me  
Tell me you'll stay forever  
I love for a while won't do  
I want forever with you  
I just wanna be with you

Ngayon, tulad ng kahapon  
Unti-unting lumilipas ang panahon  
Bakit, tanong sa aking isip  
Hanggang kailan ang pagtitiis  
  
REFRAIN  
Ika'why nalayo  
Lumayo na wala sa piling ko  
Ngunit...  
  
CHORUS  
'Di magbabago ang aking puso  
Hanggang ngayon, bukas, ito ay pangako  
Pag-ibig ko sa 'yo'why walang hanggang  
  
Noon kaysaya natin  
Ikot ng mundo'why hindi napapansin  
Bakit kailangan pang mangyari  
Damdamin ko sa 'yo'why nilimot mo  
  
[Repeat REFRAIN]  
[Repeat CHORUS]  
  
BRIDGE  
Maghihintay sa 'yong pagbabalik  
Bukas ang aking puso  
Ang nakaraa'why nilimot ko na  
(Ngayon, tulad ng kahapon)  
Pag-ibig ko sa 'yo'why walang hanggang  
(Ito ay pangako)  
  
[Repeat CHORUS twice]  

There are nights when I can't help but cry  
And I wonder why you have to leave me  
  
Why did it have to end so soon  
When you said that you would never leave me  
  
[Chorus:]  
Tell me  
Where did I go wrong?  
What did I do to make you change your mind completely  
When I thought  
This love would never end  
But if this love's not ours to have  
I'll let it go  
With your goodbye  
  
Why did it have to end so soon  
When you said that you would never leave me  
Tell me  
Where did I go wrong?  
What did I do to make you change your mind completely?  
When I thought  
This love would never end  
But if this love's not ours to have  
I'll let it go  
With your goodbye...

I heard you for so long  
And the promises you made  
Keep me hanging on  
Don't know why  
I've got to know  
Is this love enough to show it  
Let it go  
Will I ever get to heaven with you?  
Will I ever breath the air that you do?  
Will I ever touch the angels?  
Will we fly?  
Will I ever?  
Will I ever get to heaven with you?  
Another night starts to fall  
And the wind carries me  
When I wanna crawl  
?Coz when I look inside  
There's a fire in me  
That I can't hide, who  
Wishin? for an angel  
Searchin' in my mind  
Getting tired of waiting in me  
Praying
