Nothing I can say  
Can make your picture talk  
I feel so tired and  
Nothing I can do  
Will make your picture move  
I feel so helpless but  
I can feel  
A child with the ghost here  
You let your heart slip away  
If I had one wish  
I'd wish to talk with you  
I have some questions  
Things only you could know  
If I had one wish  
I'd wish to talk with you  
Nothing you can feel  
Can feel as cold as this  
I'll sing this song and  
I'll say goodbye forever  
I wonder  
If God is all they say  
I can't believe in such things.  
I suppose  
Some games are hard to lose  
But you don't have to play 'cause  
I can feel  
A child with the ghost here  
You let your heart slip away  
If I had one wish  
I'd wish to talk with you  
I have some questions  
Things only you could know  
If I had one wish  
I'd wish to talk with you  
Nothing you can feel  
Can feel as cold as this  
I'll sing this song and  
I'll say goodbye forever  
Sometimes my mind remembers  
Sometimes my mind remembers  
If I had one wish  
I'd wish to talk with you  
I have some questions  
Things only you could know  
If I had one wish  
I'd wish to talk with you  
Nothing you can feel  
Can feel as cold as this  
If I had one wish  
I'd wish to talk with you  
I have some questions  
Things only you could know  
If I had one wish  
I'd wish to talk with you  
Nothing you can feel  
Can feel as cold as this  
I'll sing this song and  
I'll say goodbye forever  

You and me are old  
You and me are young  
You and me have always  
Let words go unsung  
  
Nothing left to see  
Nothing left to do  
Nothing left to talk about  
  
How I intrude  
This impossible room  
I still believe  
That great American smile  
  
Nothing's ever right  
Nothing's ever wrong  
But nothing's ever quite like  
The stories and songs (nothing's ever)  
  
Heroes always bleed  
But heroes never cry  
Heroes always get the best girl  
And then die (nothing's ever)  
  
How I intrude  
This impossible dream  
I still believe  
That great American smile  
  

Here we play games  
Like turning men into boys  
And everyone must cry or love  
  
Recall 'my circuit'  
Recall 'I'm not-you are'  
Remember that I moved too soon  
  
Corridor empty  
Time to call in the stage  
A game called echo  
  
Now I ask questions  
I get so nervous of  
A game called echo  
  
We rename vehicles  
You rename heroes  
I switch to auto  
  
You are reception  
I can take it or leave  
Do I need permission to stop?

I'll crawl for you  
Hurt if you want to  
I'll be the thing that you feed  
  
I'm not asking  
For love or redemption  
I'll sell my guilt to your need  
  
I'll breathe for you  
Die if you want to  
I'll mourn with you by my grave  
  
I dare you to judge me  
Now God has disowned me  
I've come to you to be saved  
  
They say I  
Sold my soul  
And we all reap  
What we sow  
  
I'll shine for you  
Burn if you want to  
You'll be the prize for my pain  
  
I'll kill your God  
And pray for salvation  
I'll be the in to your sane  
  
I'll lie for you  
Be your conscience in you  
Sacrifice reason for shame  
  
I won't ask for  
Faith or forgiveness  
I'll be the blood in your veins  
  
They say I  
lost my way  
I'll wait for  
Judgment day  
  
Don't pray for my soul  
Don't pray for my soul  
Don't pray for my soul  
Don't pray for my soul  
  
I'll be your darkness  
In the night  
I'll be a vampire calling  
In the dead of night  
  
I'll be your demon  
Shadow man  
I'll be your one confession  
  
And if I can  
I'll be your nightmare  
And scream for you  
I'll be your one possession  
If you want me to  
  
I'll be your secret  
Memory  
I'll be your exhibition of atrocity  
  
They say I  
Sold my soul  
And we all reap  
What we sow  
  
They say I  
Lost my way  
I'll wait for  
Judgment day  
  
Don't pray for my soul  
Don't pray for my soul  
Don't pray for my soul  
Don't pray for my soul  
  
They kneel down, praise God  
Shout 'Hallelujah'  
Lift up their eyes while they pray  
  
When children kill children  
Don't it make them wonder?  
Don't it make them question their faith?

Here we are  
We drift like gas  
On someone else's bed  
I pay high you know  
  
Here we are  
How old are you  
It's just a job to me  
  
Here the ladies always ring twice  
Thought you'd slip away tonight with me  
In a subway I called 'you'  
  
Hello you no more this talk of  
'My boys will be yours'  
  
No more 'I'  
This conversation drains  
My patience dry.  
  
Here the business always rings twice  
No relaxing for the boys tonight  
In a subway I called 'you'  
  
Here the tension always slows twice  
Shed one tear it's just routine for now  
In a subway I called 'you'  
  

I would swim across oceans  
Just to talk with you  
I would climb a tall mountain  
Just to look at you  
I'd give my soul to the devil  
If you asked me to  
I would walk out of heaven  
Just to be with you  
  
This is absolute  
This is absolution  
  
I would be your disciple  
And I'd worship you  
Burn the prophets of reason  
Light the sky for you  
Kill the children of Eden  
If you want me to  
Close the dead eyes of God  
If they offended you  
  
This is absolute  
This is absolution

Somewhere in the city  
There's a struggle going on  
Someones making money  
Someones doing wrong  
Everybody searching for a little piece of gold  
(power play? )(fix a face? ) never grow old  
Its a shame  
Whos gonna take control?  
Its a game they play  
Whos gonna save your soul?  
And they're never gonna stop  
Till they reach the top  
All across the nation  
Fever takes control  
Money is temptation  
Money saves your soul  
One thing I can tell you  
Of this there is no doubt  
The rich man needs his comfort  
And the poor man does without  
Everybody loves somebody  
All around the world  
But everybody knows  
Its the rich man gets the girl  
-chorus-  
Look at all the little people  
(cowering? ) from the rain  
Standing at the bus stop  
Dreaming bout spain  
Here comes the rich man  
Driving his car  
When he was poor he was sure  
He was gonna go far  
-repeat chorus to fade-

So I wandered like Jesus  
Like an alien cure  
Searching for my disciples  
Dispossessed and alone.  
So I looked deeper  
Into evil  
And I came closer  
To your corruption.  
I took a virgin like Mary  
And said "I give you The One"  
I confessed to desire  
And watched the world come undone.  
So I looked deeper  
Into evil  
And I came closer  
To your obsession.  
So I looked deeper  
Into evil  
And I came closer  
To Heaven.  
Your Heaven.  
So I moved like a rumour  
Like a glorious lie  
And I walked into Heaven  
Into dead paradise.  

All I know is you're not with me,  
Like me.  
All I know...  
You're not with me.  
Some can shine,  
Some can fly,  
Some are glorious,  
Some are ancient.  
Some are wise,  
Some are strong,  
Some are everything  
You could dream of.  
Some are clouds,  
Some are rain,  
Float like angel wings  
On an ocean.  
Some can sing  
Songs of Gods,  
Words so beautiful  
They fall like raindrops.  
Fall like raindrops.  
Fall like raindrops.  
But none are like me,  
All I know is you're not with me,  
Like me.  
All I know is you're not with me.  
All I know is you're not with me,  
Like me.  
All I know is you're not with me.  
Some will cry,  
Cry for you,  
Take your pain away  
When you're sleeping.  
Some will die,  
In your name,  
Give their soul to you  
For safe keeping.  
All I know is you're not with me,  
Like me.  
All I know...  
All I know is that you're not with me,  
Like me. (x3)  
All I know is that you're not with me.  
You're not with me. (x4)  
  

It's cold outside  
And the paint's peeling off of my walls  
There's a man outside  
In a long coat, grey hat, smoking a cigarette  
  
Now the light fades out  
And I'm wondering what I'm doing in a room like this  
There's a knock on the door  
And just for a second I thought I remembered you  
  
So now I'm alone  
Now I can think for myself  
About little deals  
And issues  
And things that I just don't understand  
A white lie that night  
Or a sly touch at times  
I don't think it meant anything to you  
  
So I open the door  
It's the 'friend' that I'd left in the hallway  
Please sit down  
A candlelit shadow on a wall near the bed  
  
You know I hate to ask  
But, are 'friends' electric?  
Only mine's broke down  
And now I've no one to love  
  
So I find out your reasons  
For the phone calls and smiles  
And it hurts  
And I'm lonely  
And I should never have tried  
And I missed you tonight  
It must be time to leave  
You see it meant everything to me

Here am I  
Like a target in flesh  
One more time  
For you to call out the dogs  
Passengers  
With a ticket to burn and burn and burn  
You will learn  
I'm still waiting for you you know  
  
I'm a slogan, an old story,  
A disease, never again  
I don't like this, new anger,  
These young boys, just make me laugh  
This picture, I'm so nervous,  
The DJ, says 'who are you?'  
Look at me, I'm shaking,  
I don't know if I can move  
  
I don't need  
This attention again  
I've lost time  
I could lose everything  
You will learn  
That you've nowhere to go so go

Why don't you ever listen?  
It's you I'm talking to  
This time it's your decision  
We're into something new  
I know that I'm sinking  
Oh any fool can see  
Time that I was thinking  
Of no-one else but me  
  
Change your mind  
Nothing ever stays the same  
Change your mind  
No-one ever plays the game game game  
Change your mind  
Give up what you can't defend  
Change your mind  
Think it up and start again 'gain 'gain  
  
Why can't you reconsider  
Listen if you care  
Take familiar giver  
Reject me if you dare  
Give me what I'm asking  
And save it all for me  
Love that's everlasting  
That's how it's meant to be  
  
Change your mind  
Nothing ever stays the same  
Change your mind  
No-one ever plays the game game game  
Change your mind  
Give up what you can't defend  
Change your mind  
Think it up and start again 'gain 'gain  
  
Change your mind  
Nothing ever stays the same  
Change your mind  
No-one ever plays the game game game  
Change your mind  
Give up what you can't defend  
Change your mind  
Think it up and start again 'gain 'gain

Something isn't right  
I get the feeling I'm not driving  
Something hasn't quite  
Taken over but it's trying  
  
Check it, check it  
  
The question now is time  
The hours pass so slowly  
I know we're moving out of line  
But that's the risk you're taking with me  
  
I flicker like an old film - Black white  
I'm losing track of what's real - I know  
My sense of timing's not quite - OK  
Maybe I'll stay tonight - So so  
  
Fadeout, as in lose  
My character is shrapnel  
Broken by the views  
Of men who claim to know all  
(There is to know)  
  
Something isn't right  
I get the feeling I am no-one  
Something hasn't quite  
Stopped me from being someone  
  
Nothing in the mirror - Check it  
No photo by my bedside - Check it  
My self control is missing - Check it  
I'll leave with your permission - Check it  

Listen up  
This is confession  
This machine motion is sure to break my heart  
Listen up  
This is confession  
Recorded music sticks in the throat of God.  
I O you, you don't own me  
I O you, you don't own me  
Party time, one mor night, everybody's affected  
Listen up  
This is confession  
You are a poison that flows into my veins.  
Listen up  
This is confession  
I've never been so scared of letting you down.  
You know me, so come closer  
You know me, so come closer  
Party time, one more town, everybody's affected.  
I know you, you don't need me  
I know you, you don't need me  
Party time, one more girl, everybody's affected  
Listen up  
This is confession  
They tell me heaven just has to be somewhere  
Listen up  
This is confession  
I'd lie to God if I could make him believe.  
You owe me, and I need you  
You owe me, and I need you  
Party time, one more game, everybody's affected  
This is my confession  
This is my confession  
Party time, one more lie, everybody's affected  

Don't things change  
Don't we all  
What's it like to crash?  
The driver  
  
Nothing more to prove  
So please just send in the machines  
We know little of celebrations  
And how things are with you  
You're hung up on time  
You're hung up on age  
Now there's me  
Now there's me  
What is it like to  
Crash? The driver  
  
You drink to rumors and talk  
About someone new in your bed  
There is no game to win so  
Get out as fast as you can  
  
Hung up on 'the time'  
Hung up on 'my age'  
You don't know  
You don't know  
What it's like to  
Crash? The driver

The more I take a look inside, the more I'm fried  
The more I understand the ride, the more I slide  
The more you put me back in line, the more I tried  
The more you looked into my eyes, the more you lied  
I come back crazier, but feel much better  
You come back crazier, you'll feel better  
The more I disregard the signs, the more I fly  
The more I walk across the lines, the more I glide  
You come back crazier, but feel much better  
You come back crazier, you'll feel better  
You come back crazier, but feel much better  
You come back crazier, you'll feel better  
  

I need it  
The sex skin habit  
You could just crawl out  
And forget I'm here  
  
I need it  
Love and something  
I'd just as soon forget  
So keep it out the papers  
  
I need it  
The sex musicians  
I'll show you something  
While the boys beat time  
  
I need it  
And she's still waiting  
We like to wake up  
In a strange bed romance  
  
One more time for me  
You are the young things fed on garbage and lies  
Please one more time for me  
You are the young things fed on garbage and lies  
I'm talking far too much about my shame  
  
I need it  
Creatures calling  
I'll tear my heart out  
But I need some more  
  
I need it  
I'm under pressure  
I don't remember  
If her story's true

You could say I'm pretentious  
You could say I'm the nazz  
You could hail me as the new king of it all  
You could say I'm nothing new  
You could speak well of me  
You could say it's already been done before  
  
What will you make of my lines  
What will you think I've said  
What hidden secrets will you say are in my head  
  
I feel you waiting for me  
Waiting to dig my grave  
I'm growing scared of everything you could say  
  
Look in my eyes  
There's no surprise at all  
Critical mind  
What will you find to say  
  
Old faces in my wardrobe  
So many I've not seen  
Memories to look back on people I've been  
Dead love on faded carpets  
Nostalgia grows with time  
I see your face in mirrors shadowing mine  
I see your dirty finger  
Marks are still on my wall  
I can recall the time we tried it that way  
In dingy hotel backrooms  
Where paint cracks like your face  
I must admit I have acquired the taste (?)  
  
Stab my arm  
With your synthetic feelings  
You amaze me  
I crave for you  
  
You could say I'm pretentious  
You could say I'm the nazz  
You could hail me as the new king of it all  
  

I don't cry  
Or forget  
I'll cut my picture on your heart  
No names  
You've got one more game to lose  
  
I was young  
I was clean  
But now my soul eats me alive  
I was kind  
Now I'm your first big mistake  
  
Don't leave  
What'ya gonna do?  
Are you gonna break down and cry?  
  
She sold pain  
She sold mine  
She sold my secret to the man  
She sold lies  
And so now I break the word  
  
Don't leave  
What'ya gonna do?  
Are you gonna break down and cry?  
  
Tear up my picture  
Tear up my face  
You'll tear up your feelings but the memory's quite safe  
  
Look back in anger  
Look back and cry  
Look up my number if you want to know why  
  
Don't leave  
What'ya gonna do?  
Are you gonna break down and cry?  
  
Same need  
Same cure  
I'll whisper words to ease your shame  
Play time  
I've got one more trick for you  
  
I don't pray  
Wrong man  
I don't look for love that I don't need  
Wrong place  
You've got one more chance to leave  
  

Why cry now  
It's over  
Feelings change  
How are you  
How am I  
Cry, the clock said.  
  
I know little of romance  
And these little tract houses  
I know even less of you  
And if you should ever think of me  
Maybe as a game you lost  
Well someone I know lost the whole damn world  
No more this talk of they're out to get me  
Just slide out of Sydney and I can never go back  
How could I be surprised  
How could I even believe  
Cry, the clock said  
I'll forget who you are  
I'll forget one of these days  
Cry, the clock said

When I think of what he's done  
I can dance, dance, dance all day, all night  
Come on stand, clap your hands dance, dance  
  
Dance, everybody down with us just dance  
Wanna feel the groove then clap your hands  
They ask who's been blessed tonight, I am  
God's been good to me, never to be too late  
And continually he's great he's on time  
Even if I have to sit and wait  
  
Sitting in the corner reminiscing  
The course my life  
Has taken all my ups and all my downs  
But your mercy and grace brought me to this place  
  
When I think of what he's done  
I can dance, dance, dance all day, all night  
Come on stand, clap you hands dance, dance  
  
Trials and pain temptations reign  
I never see how I'm gone make it though on my own  
Not a chance, so I have to turn to you  
Then you come and rescue me once again and again  
So right now all I can do is give you praise  
  
It's alright, it's okay, come clap your hands  
Give him praise, give him praise  
Go ahead just stand up  
Come on shout and dance, give him praise  
  
When I think of what he's done  
I can dance, dance, dance all day, all night  
Come on stand, clap your hands, dance  

I've been waiting here  
Waiting for faith  
And the word to fall.  
Now the darkness comes  
And I'll pray for  
The end of us all.  
  
Don't let the dark into me  
We killed the angels that warned us of you  
Don't let the dark into me  
We raised the tower of Babel for you  
Don't let the dark into me  
We let the children build temples for you  
Don't let the dark into me  
Don't let the vengeance of Heaven be you  
  
So pray to me, I'm the Lord's new disease,  
Look down into the face of God.  
Bow down and cry, I'm the black Messiah,  
The one true divinity.  
Kneel before my altar and drink the wine of slaughter,  
Who said I'd save anyone?  
So bleed for me, I need hostility  
To lead the faithful and the blind.  
  
Don't let the light shine on me  
I am the poison that feeds life to you  
Don't let the light shine on me  
I am the demon that waits inside you  
Don't let the light shine on me  
I am the ghost that reminds death of you  
Don't let the light shine on me  
I am the darkness that crawls into you

You're like poison  
You smile at me  
Talk of love.  
'He' will forgive me  
If I confess.  
Your dark Sunday  
You lied to me  
And so I  
Replaced God  
With a picture of my car.  
I don't like this  
I don't like this.  
I'm on the E kick  
So heaven's in my head  
I'm in Outland  
Shame on me.  
I want pictures  
People come, people go  
D'you think God  
Will forgive me soon?  
You won't like this  
You won't like this.  
Rip it up  
Rip it into pieces  
Rip it up  
Rip it for good.  
Touch me, touch me.  
He won't like this  
He won't like this  
'He' won't touch me  
I can't dance and I can't sing  
I'm not stone shape  
But time runs out.  
I don't like this  
All I see is cold and hard  
All I can do now  
Is break 'the word'  
I don't like this  
I don't like this.  
'He' will love me?  
Well thank him  
For nothing.  
I need that like  
I need a disease.  
So pray for me.  
I don't mind  
I don't care.  
I've found love  
It's an American machine.  
I don't like this  
I don't like this.  

Thought I was asleep  
Lost to dreams  
I was dying in a big machine  
Didn't think the voice that called me  
Could be real.  
  
Thought I woke up  
Lost my faith  
I was staring at the face of rage  
Didn't think I'd see the demon in "His" heart  
  
Thought I saw blood  
Turn to wine  
A vision from the angel wars  
Didn't think I'd find the savior in the dark  
  
Thought I saw a light  
Tear the storm  
Showing me the way to God  
Didn't know that Heaven died and went to Hell  
  
Blessed is dead Heaven  
Blessed are shadows and pain  
Blessed is dead Heaven  
Blessed is death in "His" name  
  
Thought I saw rain  
Black and cold  
Falling on a child's grave  
Thought I saw an angel laugh and piss on it  
  
Thought I saw a dance  
Strange and cruel  
Swaying to the screams of men  
Thought I saw the Lord's disciples laugh at that  
  
Thought I saw love  
Sacrificed  
Mary under three wise men  
Thought I saw the Virgin look at me and cry  
  
Thought I saw a cross  
And Jesus dead  
Burning in the midnight sky  
Thought I saw God dancing in the flames  
  
Glory is dead Heaven  
Glory is shadows and pain  
Glory is dead Heaven  
Glory is death in "His" name  
  
"Do you confess?"  
"Cleanse your sin"  
"Do you believe in the word of God?"  
  
Welcome to dead Heaven  
Welcome to shadows and pain  
Welcome to dead Heaven  
Welcome to death in "His" name

So I close my eyes and drift into sleep  
But something is here  
In the dark, in the dream  
Like a cruel wind clutching my heart  
I feel more than I see  
Like a clue to a nightmare that I can't believe  
Then it touches me and I try to scream  
And a thought tears me inside  
And I will do anything  
Anything, you understand?  
Just to wake up  
  
Sometimes it almost makes me cry  
Sometimes it seems to call my name out loud  
Sometimes it feels like I'm alone  
And then it comes for me again  
  
I'm told it's called 'The unreality dream'  
I'm told it's called 'The great American lie'  
I'm told that this is like the vengeance of God  
I can't believe that God would do this to me  
  
I've known fear many times but nothing like this  
I'm so scared I can't breathe  
I know I'm asleep but I know this is real  
And nothing can help me here  
I'm deep inside something and I may never come back  
And then it was gone  
And then I realized that 'The Rush' brought it in  
And I will never sleep alone again  
  
Sometimes it almost breaks my heart  
Sometimes I swear I hear it laugh at me  
Sometimes it feels like I could die  
And then it leaves my dreams again  
  
Feels like I'm fighting the possession of my soul  
I'm told that this is called 'The sickness of need'  
I've got to cut the sex connection and slide  
A word of warning to the weary and wise

I remember one girl  
Saw her again in a magazine  
Front cover, big star  
Showing things that I'd never seen  
Well maybe  
Can you feel it? Can you?  
I remember one girl  
Who'd believe she'd be so devious  
Bad decision, bad move  
She told the papers everything  
Well maybe  
Do you need it, do you?  
Do you want it, do you?  
Come and get it  
I remember one girl  
She'd only make friends in expensive cars  
Television, good wine  
Leather seats and a friend of mine  
Well maybe  
Something's coming  
Oh no  

Charm up, strange down  
Old face, new sound.  
Same kick, same pain  
Same reason, same game so.  
Dance, let's move.  
I can't dance, I can't sing  
I'm too old, I'm too thin so?  
Motion, I'm in love  
One night's enough so.  
Dance, let's move.  
You can play  
You can lose  
You can't win  
('I'm still looking for rhythm')  
You can choose  
Move up, I don't like this motion  
Move out, I don't like this feeling  
Move up, I don't need devotion  
Move out, I don't need a reason.  
'And I'm still looking for the rhythm.'  

You let me down  
How cold love can be  
I've nothing more to lose  
I'm trapped inside and dying  
I'm trapped inside and dying  
I don't sleep without you  
Empty bed, empty heart  
I'm trapped inside and dying  
I'm trapped inside and I'll wait for you  
Years and years and years  
How strange love can be  
It bends and tears and screams  
But only here inside me  
But only here inside me  
I don't live without you  
There's nothing I can do  
I'm waiting always waiting  
I'm waiting oh but don't leave me now  
I'm here forever  
You don't come  
You don't come forever  

All that we are  
Is all that we need to be  
All that we know  
Is you and machinery  
We're engineers  
  
We are your heartbeat  
We are your night life  
We are your 'low-line'  
We keep you alive for now  
We're engineers  
  
We are your voice  
We are your blood flow  
We are your eyes  
We're all you need to know  
We're engineers  
  
All that we are  
Is all that you'd love to be  
All that we know  
Is hate and machinery  
We're engineers

Applicant, I am  
Clean young flesh  
Cubicles, we merge  
And me so decent  
  
Lock up my vehicle  
Crack my walls  
I'm stealing new words  
And me so honest  
  
Someone took pictures  
Just look at her go  
Her presence exhausted me  
Like spectators we are  
  
I have no address  
'Who are you?'  
Kiss my arse goodbye  
The show goes rusty.  
  
Simulate phone call  
Face to face  
Newspaper loose talk  
You wreck my dreams  
  
Exhibit 'A' dog  
So few of them left  
Exhibit 'be' god  
The problem of death  
  
Old sex, unclean  
Do you still need the moon?  
Recall no names  
Don't ask me 'how are you?'  
  
Where's my attendant  
And where is my wife  
Wait in the doorway  
While I say goodnight  
  
He looks like me  
  

I heard it in my sleep  
A voice more dead than old  
I thought I'd known the fear  
But then it touched my soul and said:  
  
You will pray for me  
Bow your head to me.  
  
It came for me at night  
And took me dream by dream  
To where everything is dark  
And no-one hears you scream  
Took everything I loved  
And turned love into pain  
It said I'm the prophecy  
And I'll make you believe in me.  
  
Sacrifice for me  
Be humility.  
  
It said:  
I'll make everyone pay  
I'll make everyone pay  
Some things you can't forget  
I'll make everyone pay  
Some things you can't forgive  
I'll make everyone pay.  
  
And so it comes to this  
Death or eternity?  
Or would you like to pay  
For all humanity?  
Do you believe in faith?  
Than choose. heaven or hell or me?  
A shadow on the sane  
The final treachery of god.  
  
You will kneel for me  
Lose your eyes for me.  
  
Betray the world for me  
Burn your soul for me.  
  
It said:  
I'll make everyone pay  
I'll make everyone pay  
Some things you can't forget  
I'll make everyone pay  
Some things you can't forgive  
I'll make everyone pay.

What's it like to be face to face with me?  
Playing tricks with hearts quite as young as yours  
Do you know what the reunion pays for you?  
Do you feel like I'm supposed to do?  
  
I could be love  
I could be your assassin. I don't know  
  
Pictures of my face dissappear with time  
They gave boys to quite tasteless friends of mine  
Re-arrange thoughts to 'what will be will be'  
There is no god so pray to me

I don't like the film  
I don't like the film  
Play it all back  
Play it all back  
  
And I don't like the scenery  
And I don't like the set so  
Pull it all down  
Pull it all down  
  
But I like the actors  
And I like the show  
  
We're so exposed  
We're so exposed  
Anything can happen  
Anything can happen  
  
Don't let them see  
Don't let them know  
And you wonder why  
And you wonder why  
  
Turn off the lights  
And turn off the sound

I fold your letter  
All lies, all cold  
I fold my memories  
My life, my soul  
I fold compassion  
And vengeance bleeds through  
I fold forgiveness  
And wait for you  
Do you hear me?  
Can you hear me fall?  
Do you feel me?  
Can you feel at all?  
I hear you calling  
I hear you calling  
I fold all reason  
Screaming your name  
I fold Your heart and  
Feed on your pain  
I hear you calling  
I hear you calling  
Can you feel?  
Can you feel?  

Look around. Do you see?  
Everything is fading  
Everything just fades away  
Look around. Do you see?  
Everyone looks lonely  
But there's only you and me  
  
Do you wonder how we came to be here?  
Do you wonder if we could find us from here?  
Look inside. Do you feel anything but bitter?  
Anything but sad and lost?  
Look inside. Do you dream of a time that's better?  
Do you ever dream of me?  
And my heart breaks when you cry in your sleep.  
So I can't wait here hoping I'm something you'll keep.  
  
I will love you. Miss you. All of my life.  
I will need you. Want you. All of my life.  
But I've lost you. Lost you. For the rest of my life.

I know that you already take as read  
I helped you  
You know the back of my hand  
  
I wish that we were enchanted  
Girl, now I take it for granted  
  
Your love was starin me right in the heart  
Why does our pride make us weak?  
While I was wonderin where to start  
You were there to show me  
All I had to learn  
  
You were way off the mark  
Most of it in the dark  
Found you now  
  
Tiny light, give the peace  
With which we reach indecision  
I guess we lived in the meantime  
Till we remembered our first lines  
  
We must have missed a turn  
Still got a lot to learn  
Found you now  
  
So now we live a life of give and take  
Day by day  
We don't control where it leads us  
  
If we compare the first day we met  
I must admit nothings changed  
I recognize only one regret  
Life embarassments unexpressed  
  
Found you now  
Found you now

Seen the man?  
New disease  
Everybody's infected.  
Seen the man?  
He'll storm your heart  
Everybody believes.  
Seen the man?  
Sly new game  
Kiss another cute baby.  
Seen the man?  
No war machine  
So everybody wants peace?  
Everybody's infected  
Everybody believes.  
I've been looking for something  
But it just gets harder  
I could look for ever  
What am I going to do.  
Storm the heart  
Boy threw up  
Everybody's disgusted.  
Storm the heart  
Girl went down  
Everybody looked shocked.  
Storm the heart  
New young thing  
Everybody's obsession.  
Storm the heart  
'Levi' jeans  
Think it's cool to kill.  
Everybody's infected  
Everybody believes.  
One more reason  
One more lie.  
Dreams are cruel  
This is life  
It replaced religion.  
Change your mind  
Make it mine  
Everybody looks sad.  
Dirty film  
Ten years old  
This is Russia infected.  
Party time  
Time runs out  
Everybody go home.  
Everybody's infected  
Everybody believes.  

We generate heat  
We generate emotion  
We generate a feeling  
That is better left here  
Than a memory on a wall  
  
I'd rather cry than forget you  
  
We generate pain  
We generate suspicion  
We generate a rumour that's sick  
But a rumour that is probably true  
  
I'd rather die than forget you  
  
(I won't let my dreams slip away from me)  
I'm talking sex motion  
I'm talking 'bout fashion  
I'm talking 'bout skin games  
I'm talking 'bout secrets  
  
(And I won't let my heart run away with me)  
I'm talking temptation  
I'm talking 'bout memories  
I'm talking 'bout feelings  
I'm talking 'bout emotion  
  
We generate lies  
We generate pictures  
We generate a video film  
That I couldn't let my best friend see  
  
I'd rather lose than forgive you  
  
We generate shame  
We generate secrets  
We generate a reason for living  
And we generate a reason for not  
  
I'd rather hurt than forget you  
  
I can't believe that I'm here  
I can't believe what I've seen  
I can't believe what I'm doing to you  
  

I was waiting for something  
I was listening to my breathing  
Like a man listening to life  
  
I was looking for fire  
It could take me or leave me  
It could all just burn away  
  
The oxygen law  
It remains me  
  
I'd been surrounded for hours  
By the sound of thinking metal  
And I knew something was wrong  
  
I can tell you what fear is  
It is the smell of burning  
And I'd been close once before  
  
I waited a long time  
How I survived God only knows  
It seemed like forever  
How I survived God only knows  
I don't like the memory  
How I survived God only knows  
How I survived God only knows  
  
I remember the feeling  
I'll remember forever  
How it all just came apart  
  
I don't believe in praying  
I don't believe in a God  
Now I question everything  
  
The dreamer is gone  
I'm an old man  
  
I could tell you of horror  
I could show you the pieces  
But I just want to forget  
  
I'm not sure if I saw it  
I'm not sure if I heard it  
I just screamed 'I can't get out'  
'I can't get out'  

And I can not be saved  
Not by you  
Not by God  
I want to bleed  
And I can hardly breath  
Look at me  
Falling down  
Before your eyes  
All I've needed  
Takes me away from you  
All I've wanted  
Takes me away from you  
All I live for  
Takes me away from you  
All I'd die for  
Takes me away from you  
And this is not my voice  
Not my face  
Not my life  
It belongs to you  
And you will not believe  
The things I've seen  
The things I've done  
All in your name  
All I've needed  
Takes me away from you  
All I've wanted  
Takes me away from you  
All I live for  
Takes me away from you  
All I'd die for  
Takes me away from you

I'll say good-bye for now  
All this love burns away  
Did you love for long?  
I'll let the boys come in  
They'll crawl for you  
Here am I  
Not talking  
Here am I  
Not sleeping  
Here am I  
There's no more I can do  
Here am I  
There's no more I can say  
Here am I  
Not talking  
Here am I  
Not sleeping  
Here am I  
There's no more I can do  
Here am I  
There's no more I can say to you  
I'm so tired of this  
Please send in someone else  
You play games with me  
But did you win?  
How do you feel?  

We we're dust in a world  
Of grim obsession.  
  
We were torn from our  
Life of isolation.  
  
We we're pulled from our path  
Of least resistance.  
  
And the songs we sang  
What became of us?  
  
We're here waiting for you  
We're here waiting for you  
  
We are yours  
We're waiting for you  
We are yours  
We're waiting for you  
  
We all pray for the end  
For the god to take us.  
  
We we're falling down  
One by one.  
  
We we're weak and the fear  
Was all around us.  
  
The machines screamed from  
Moon to sun.  
  
We're here waiting for you  
We're here waiting for you  
  
We are yours  
We're waiting for you  
We are yours  
We're waiting for you

I'm scared to sleep, I'm scared to dream  
I'm scared to wake up in case I scream  
I'm scared to whisper one word  
That's all it needs  
  
I hear it breathe, I hear it sigh  
I hear it laughing when something dies  
I hear it calling  
But I'm too scared to move  
  
I'm so scared  
I can't breathe  
I'm so scared  
I can't breath  
I'm so scared  
I just can't breathe  
  
I'm scared to look, I'm scared to see  
I'm scared of mirrors in case it's me  
I'm scared of memories  
But now that's all I have  
  
So I can't leave and nothing comes  
So no-one noticed that I've come undone  
I'd hide in shadows  
But the shadows talk to me  
  
I'm so scared  
I can't breathe  
I'm so scared  
I can't breath  
I'm so scared  
I just can't breathe

I'm playing at ice  
But I'm finding it hard  
She didn't break the wall  
She just caught me off guard  
  
Can you see ice in my eyes  
Can you see ice in my eyes  
  
I'm just a little bit sorry  
But I haven't decided why  
Could it be my memory  
Or did I ever really cry  
  
Can you see ice in my eyes  
Can you see ice in my eyes  
  
Fill my head with your false feelings  
I can't trust anything you say  
Today I missed a special friend  
That never really cared anyway  
  
Can you see ice in my eyes  
Can you see ice in my eyes  
Can you see ice in my eyes  
Can you see ice in my eyes

Send in eyes  
Thought's of crashing, all those pictures  
Send in thoughts of john the god  
  
Send in dreams  
Lovers on corners, clean my sheets  
Your only chance is break the state  
  
We are clean  
Don't ask, I'm an agent  
  
Send in change  
Secretaries, nothing more  
You can be replaced you know  
  
Send in chance  
Bad conditions, talk of leaving  
Talk of walking out on me  
  
Send in you  
Send in pain, send in lies  
Send in words that I believe  
  
Send in you  
Just watch the face, your sure to see  
Something, give this game away  
  
Send in you  
Get her out, get her out  
Call me, just don't say the name

They say I'm unforgiven and I have to pay  
Like I'm the demon resurrection  
They say that I turn innocence to panic  
But I don't care  
  
They say that my obsession is unholy  
That I deviate from reason  
They say I make you suffer for my sins  
I hope you forgive me  
  
Do you want it? [Repeat: x1]  
My desire  
  
I sink to my knees  
Head in my hands  
So now I'm just a shadow on their bleeding hearts  
This is why the righteous never learn  
I'm like a dead man hiding in the dark  
  
What do you need? [Repeat: x1]  
  
What have we become?  
All that we could be?  
Think of this as mercy, a small gift from me  
What does a confession ever do  
But take my guilt away  
  
Do you want it?  
Do you want it?  
My desire  
  
I Feel It Fall  
I Feel It Fall From Me  
I Feel It Fall Down  
I Feel It Fall For You  
  
What do you need?  
What do you need?

Listen to my voice  
And please try to understand  
The one you call Messiah is a lie  
You are just a game and It has won  
You are not the plan  
And your beginning to annoy  
You will never see  
You will never know eternal peace  
The places promised by your faith  
The God you love is gone  
He lies broken by your shame  
The thing that took His place already died  
Send black Angels for you  
It will send Angels  
I am just a voice  
Only you are pure enough for truth  
That no-one else will hear  
And then tear away belief  
You must write 'The Book'  
Only you can save the light of man  
It will send Angels  
Send black Angels for you  
  

I can't believe  
That you're gone and we're alone  
I can't believe  
That we'll never see your face  
  
I can't believe  
That you're at the gates of Heaven  
I can't believe  
That we'll never know you  
  
If only, if only  
Miracles happened every day  
If only, if only  
I could believe in something  
  
Helpless we cried over you  
Empty and lost over you  
  
How in the world  
Can they say that you're at peace?  
How in the world  
Can they say that time will heal us?  
  
How in the world  
Can we hope to be forgiven?  
How in the world  
Can we know how we feel?  
  
If only, if only  
We could all live forever  
If only, if only  
No memories to remember  
  
Words were not spoken for you  
No grave marks our love for you  
Broken our hearts call for you  
No-one can blame us but you  
  
How in the world can we ever smile again  
How in the world can we live without you

London times  
Hear they were the golden times  
Captured all the hearts and minds  
Oh how the memory shines  
Like diamonds  
Keep shining, like diamonds  
London times  
Say they were the best of times  
Dancing till the big bell chimes  
Oh how the memory shines  
Like diamonds  
Keep shining, keep shining  
Shine away  
Those were the days of (power?)  
Sing yeah for the Beatle and the Stone  
These were the days  
Yeah yeah yeah  
-repeat chorus-  
  

Sometimes I wonder if God laughs at me  
I hear His voice  
When I sleep  
  
Sometimes I wonder if The Holy Ghost  
Is haunting me  
In my dreams  
  
Save me  
Save me  
  
Sometimes I wonder, does an angel die?  
Rest in peace  
Here with me?  
  
Sometimes I wonder if a soul can cry?  
I feel a pain  
Next to mine  
  
Can you hear me?  
Can you hear me?  
I don't think He died for me  
  
I know that Heaven is a burnt out shell  
I know forgiveness is the door to Hell  
I know confession is a black empty lie  
Look in my eyes  
Look in my eyes  
  
Save me  
  
Save me

We're in the building  
Where they make us grow  
And I'm frightened by  
The liquid engineers  
Like you.  
  
My Mallory heart  
Is sure to fail  
I could crawl around the floor  
Just like I'm real  
Like you.  
  
The sound of metal  
I want to be  
You  
I could learn to be a man  
Like you.  
  
Plug me in  
And turn me on  
Oh everything is moving.  
  
I need my treatment  
It's tomorrow they send me  
Singing 'I am an American'.  
Do you?  
  
Picture this  
If I could make the change  
I'd love to pull the wires from the wall  
Did you?  
  
And who are you  
And how can I try  
Here inside I like metal  
Aren't you  
  
All I know  
Is no-one dies  
I'm still confusing love with need.

At 4 o'clock we land  
And I'll wave my flag for you  
Interest in heart  
We are not savage  
Like children  
We're people  
What difference I say  
  
Music for chameleons  
Music for chameleons  
  
A dream of siam  
We could leave in the morning  
Old friends and shy  
We need to win  
Like you need to breathe  
I've an interest in games  
  
Music for chameleons  
Music for chameleons  
  
Gowns for another show  
Maybe no-one will come  
  
Here take my arm  
I like the pictures  
And you like ghost stories  
Tomorrow I'll sigh  
  
Music for chameleons  
Music for chameleons

Assassination of the voice of God  
I don't know if I can do it  
I've found the problem and the problem's you  
I'm here to pick up the pieces.  
  
You won't remember me but I do you  
I told you that I would come back  
Everything will be decided here  
They can read it in the papers.  
  
Your breathing haunts me  
My breathing?  
The sleeproom still waits for me.  
  
Join the army you can see the world  
I remember this one patrol  
Been liberating river towns  
And we picked up the sex skin crawl.  
  
We would sing the new leader's song  
Everyone invented stories  
The connection was a fragile thing  
Far too many distractions.  
  
I've been listening to the new 'DJ'  
What's all this 'original' con?  
We all live in the same museum  
We all rearrange the same old song.  
  
Assassination by the radio  
I don't know if they can do it  
I've found the problem and the problem's 'One'  
I'm here to pick up the pieces.  
  

Somewhere in  
Dark corners  
I know  
Something is wrong.  
  
No fear  
No talking  
Just this long wait for pain  
  
Scream scream  
We're going down  
My centurion dies  
  
All I can do now is wait for the noise  
  
I'm so helpless and  
I could just cry inside  
'No! No!'  
  
Oh God  
Look at the speed  
We're going in  
  
So this  
Is death and  
It's so  
Calm I'm surprised  
  
All I can do now is wait for noise  
  
This machine  
No sign of life  
Only the whisper of air  
  
She won't turn  
She won't climb  
She won't stop  
She won't fly  
  
I'm falling  
I'm silent  
I'm thinking  
I'm waiting for this thing to end.  
  
All I can do now is wait for the noise.  
  

Why give orders?  
Why give speeches?  
  
No more questions  
No more answers  
All that's left is the fear  
  
I can feel they're here  
I can feel the cold  
I can't fight for long  
This machine runs down  
  
If I had a picture  
I could say it's all for you.  
  
Why give orders?  
And why make speeches?  
Give me a reason to stay  
  
This dying machine  
I can hear me scream  
I've nowhere to run  
I've nowhere to hide  
  
I can only wonder  
I can only wonder why  
  
Why give orders?  
And why make speeches?  
Give me a reason to die  
  
This shape comes apart  
Everything breaks down  
And me, I'm trapped inside  
And here inside it ends.  
  
There's nothing I can do  
There's nothing I can do now  
If I had a picture  
I could say it's all for you  
I can only wonder  
I can only wonder why

Stroll to the cafe  
My God how time flies  
I close up my brain  
And another friend dies  
I feel like a mirror  
Feel like nothing is mine  
I could go back to crying  
But now dying seems fine  
So I hang from the ceiling  
Or I sit on the air  
Or rot in a corner  
Until somebody cares  
Faces at random  
I quote people I knew  
I'd love to be like me  
If I can feel like you  
Here am I more roche five than pain  
Here am I just me and my walls to blame  
Here am I, I really don't feel quite sane  
Here am I still searching for my shadow in vain  
Lock my door I only think in black and white  
I'll even try to look ashamed  
Moving out of central  
Somebody knows me well  
Says he'll spill the whole story  
He may be lying I can't tell  
Meet me inside  
I'll keep my head to the floor  
And one hand on the handle  
Of the mad sane door  
Here am I more roche five than pain  
Here am I just me and my walls to blame  
Here am I, I really don't feel quite sane  
Here am I still searching for my shadow in vain  
Lock my door I only think in black and white  
I'll even try to look ashamed  
My shadow in vain  
My shadow in vain  
My shadow in vain  
...  

I've read the papers  
Look at this  
They say that I'm all over  
I don't know  
They're not the first ones to try  
So try  
Again  
What's the fashion?  
Is it good?  
I'll need some convincing  
If you've got it  
Then I've seen it before  
So try  
Again  
Welcome to new anger  
Do you want it?  
Do you want it?  
I don't need it  
I can stop  
I can take this or leave it  
You can have it  
But if you want it from me  
Then come  
And try  
I've been bad  
I've been good  
I've been one more hero  
I've been up  
And I've been lower than you  
So come  
And try  
If you want it  
Come and get it  

New thing from London Town  
Refugees of broken sound  
The sound of breathing and crying hearts  
This situation tears me apart.  
  
The new police will find me soon  
I can't hide inside this room  
I'm waiting for the boys to come  
Then we can move out one by one.  
  
New thing from London Town.  
New thing from London Town  
Nothing left to keep us down  
We are not responsible  
  
Someone pays and someone falls  
We slide into the night  
Silhouettes in a cold blue light  
Take a look and look away  
We need something we need to play.  
  
New thing from London Town.

Boys watch from windows tonight  
I'm not surpriesed to see you waiting here  
You keep them in business just supplying you  
Get in the car I've something to say  
  
Stay in bed why waste my time  
Open your eyes but only if you can  
Office in a sidestreet is no place for you  
Night talk and romance like beat the clock.  
  
Boys like me aren't supposed to cry  
But it's so easy to do  
Boys like me aren't supposed to cry  
But just look at you  
Night talk.  
  
Take things slow you can crack  
Like your face I don't understand  
How you smile and pretend it's fun  
Do you laugh when the rats come round to play?  
  
Boys like me aren't supposed to cry  
But it's so easy to do  
Boys like me aren't supposed to cry  
But just look at you  
Night talk.  

Everything  
Everything reminds me  
Easily  
You walking out so easily  
No goodbyes  
Not even a tear for me  
Now you cry  
Youd like to have my company  
  
But I'm not gonna call you again  
I'm not gonna pick up the phone  
No I'm not going through it again  
Youre not gonna leave me alone  
  
No more lies  
I don't need this anymore  
I've heard it all  
Now I'm gonna close the door  
Seems to me  
Nothing comes that easily  
Time to leave  
Youll take it all and run from me  
  
But I'm not gonna call you again  
I'm not gonna pick up the phone  
No I'm not going through it again  
Youre not gonna leave me alone  
  
I'm not gonna call you again  
I'm not gonna pick up the phone  
No I'm not going through it again  
Youre not gonna leave me alone  
  
But I'm not gonna call you again  
I'm not gonna pick up the phone  
No I'm not going through it again  
Youre not gonna leave me alone  
  
I'm not gonna call you again  
I'm not gonna pick up the phone  
No I'm not going through it again  
Youre not gonna leave me alone  
  
But I'm not gonna call you again  
I'm not gonna pick up the phone  
No I'm not going through it again  
Youre not gonna leave me alone

Whats it to you  
If I feel now  
Just a face in the wall  
Crawling out of the ground  
Now look at me  
You cry  
Like a leaf in the fall  
I fly in the sky, dont you?  
  
Whats it to you  
This noise noise  
Like a plaque on the wall  
One of these days  
Ill just leave  
(whats it to you? )  
As boys drown  
You feel like young gods  
You know  
All young gods must fade  
(whats it to you? )  
  
Whats it to you  
Going down boys  
Like a screw in the wall  
My lovers never leave in love  
Play war like marines  
Just noise noise  
Just roar roar  
One of these days  
  
(whats it to you? )

Sometimes things don't work out the way you planned  
Sometimes words don't say the things you mean  
Sometimes you can't explain the way you feel  
Sometimes when we smile we tell the same lie  
  
With a whisper, everything you know  
Is torn away and life just stops  
With a whisper, everything you are  
Just falls apart and dies  
  
And all those things that you meant to change  
Are thoughts lost on the way to this  
And all those sorries you never said  
Are words lost on the wind  
  
Did you ever wonder about the end?  
Did you ever you wish that I was still there?  
Did you ever call my name by mistake?  
Did you ever cry yourself to sleep?  
  
Slowly, slowly, we lose the love that binds us  
Slowly, slowly, we lose the care that holds us  
Slowly, slowly, we lose the time that shares us  
Slowly, slowly, we lose the heart to save us  
  
Sometimes things are not the way they seem  
Sometimes friends are not the friends they seem  
Sometimes time is not the cure it seems  
Sometimes love is not the love we dream of

Hollow  
Faces staring through my window  
Sometimes  
I can play a boy you might know  
Station  
Standing cold and old I'm insane  
Gender  
Is uncertain just like my name  
  
The lemon kid is my friend  
But even he don't know me well  
Oh that's too bad  
The waiter is an old man  
Who looks at me so sly and strange  
What's on his mind  
  
Oh didn't I say I'm not one of you  
Oh didn't I say I'm not one of you  
  
Queenie  
From a doorway says "You got time?"  
Panic  
Not tonight if you don't mind  
Oh no  
My fear of streets I cover  
Today  
My room is home for hours  
  
You can stay if you know your lines  
But please take care  
I'll suck your mind dry  
You'll never guess  
And you can never know me  
I'll change if I begin to feel  
What's your name  
  
Zero hero says I'm no-one  
He could be right but who's to know  
Man from the sky  
Oh well I'm growing tired of this place  
I think it's time to change my face  
You can't even try  
  
Oh didn't I say I'm not one of you  
Oh didn't I say I'm not one of you  
Oh didn't I say I'm not one of you  
Oh didn't I say I'm not one of you  
  

They say that  
Neon lights are bright on broadway  
They say there's always magic in the air  
But when you're walking down the street  
And you aint had enough to eat  
The city all lights up and you're nowhere  
  
They say  
The girls are something else on broadway  
Looking at them just gives me the blues  
Cause howre you gonna make some time  
When all you got is one thin dime  
And one thin dime wont even shine your shoes  
  
They say that  
Love wont last too long on broadway  
Now catch a greyhound bus for home  
They all say  
I bet they're wrong, I know they are  
Cause I can play this here guitar  
And I wont quit till I'm a star  
On broadway

One. One perfect lie.  
Was it told too soon?  
And one, one perfect life  
Turned to stone  
Cold mercy  
  
I kneel down by your grave  
I kneel down torn and guilty  
  
Did I let you down,  
Say goodbye too soon?  
And did you understand  
My mistake?  
Forgive me  
  
I kneel down by your side  
I kneel down scared and helpless  
  
One perfect lie  
Wrapped in kindness and tears  
I wish I believed in your heaven  
One perfect life  
Led by blind faith and trust  
If God has a heart he will find you  
  
I'm torn and guilty  
I'm torn and guilty  
I'm torn and guilty

Only a downstat  
Personality problem  
He would say things like 'I love you'  
And cry real tears  
Met him in some place  
Like a home for old mothers  
Where the cure is always death  
But no-one ever leaves  
He wore a number 7  
Badge on his collar  
He would show it with pride  
And say 'it means I can feel'  
He'd bribe the warders  
To send letters to someone  
Who didn't even know his name  
But said she'd read them anyway  
And in the evening (??)  
He writes poetry for people  
Who deny he's alive  
And say 'I'll mention that name'  
A violator of the law of no feelings  
They should be put in the chair  
Until their eyes come in (??)  
If you have reasons  
I might sell you my time  
I'll leave it under the stairs  
In a body of mine  
Old memories are slowly fading out of me  
We are the unknowns, we are all you need  
  

I'm in Outland  
Sex tension  
She whispers things I need  
Look in her heart  
Slow motion  
'I've been expecting you.'  
I'm in Outland  
I'll do anything.  
I'm in Outland  
Storm my heart  
Tear me up if you like.  
Come closer  
Say nothing  
I've got something for you.  
I shape sound  
I shape time  
I'll shape your world for you.  
I'm in Outland  
I'll do anything.  
I'm in Outland  
Emotion  
Dark whispers in my head.  
Got the sex scream  
On new film  
I've got the friend I need.  
Don't play safe  
Don't play clean  
Don't play if you can't lose.  
I'm in Outland  
I'll do anything.  

I was young  
I was cold but not insane  
I had one good friend  
It was a voice without a name  
And so here we are  
Same need and same mistake  
But it could be yours  
You see it could be even be yours  
I said I've done things  
That left me hurt and ashamed  
She said all I need  
Is a place to hide the pain  
She said don't trust dreams  
Because dreams will break your heart  
I said little girls play in the house of shame  
Some of us play like God  
Play like God,  
Save my soul  
Play like God  
I know that God don't live here in my heart  
She said touch my soul  
I've never touched someone so cold  
She said touch my heart  
I've never touched something so old  
She said play like God  
And then you can play with me  
I moved underground  
And caught the isolation blues  
Sound familiar?  
I said kiss my face  
I've seen things you'll never see  
She said kiss my arse  
I've been everything I need  
She said memories  
Are only there to make you bleed  
I said little girls play in big boys games  
Some of us play but cry  
Play like God  
Save my soul  
Play like God  
I know that God don't live here in my world  
Where do we belong?  
She said I've been sick  
But then no-one's clean for long  
She said pray for me  
Like God, I've fucked the world  
I said little girls play with the big disease  
Some of us play with you  

Here is my  
Small black box  
Filled with hurt  
Sent by you  
Here is my  
Small black book  
Filled with lies  
Told by you  
Here is my  
Small black house  
Filled with fear  
Thanks to you  
Here is my  
Small black heart  
Filled with shame  
Left by you  
See I  
See I Don't know  
And I don't feel the pressure  
And I don't feel the pressure  
Here is my  
Small black doubt  
Filled by tears  
Cried for you  
here is my  
Small black wish  
Filled by dreams  
Lost by you  
See I  
See I Don't know  
And I don't feel the pressure  
And I don't feel the pressure  

I want to feel you hesitate  
I want to feel you pull away  
I want to feel you realize  
That I am not love come to play  
  
I want to feel your pink clean skin  
I want to feel your purity  
I want to feel you touch my pain  
I want to drown in your misery  
  
[Chorus]  
Hey, bitch, this is what you are  
Purified, sanctified, sacrificed  
Hey, bitch, this is what you are  
Purified, sanctified, sacrificed  
This is what you are  
  
I want to feel your innocence  
I want to hear you beg for 'Him'  
I want to be your animal  
I want to be your only sin  
  
I want to tear your dreams away  
And show you hopes last sanctuary  
I want to dip your wings in blood  
And watch an angel bleed for me  
  
[Chorus]

[Chorus]  
There's nothing here but us  
There's nothing here but us  
  
Remember, I was vapor  
Remember, I was just like you  
Remember, I was liquid  
Remember, I was someone too  
  
Remember, I need others  
Remember, I need oxygen  
Remember, I need lovers  
Remember, I need to forget  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Remember, I am human  
Remember, I feel just like you  
Remember, I had reasons  
Remember, I had friends like you  
  
Remember, I grow tired  
Remember, I could end all this  
Remember, I have memories  
Remember, I need to forget  
  
[Chorus]

We'll take a taxi to the show  
We could report by phone  
We could remind ourselves that  
We must laugh  
  
Reconsider: 'fame'  
I need new reasons  
This is detention it's not fun at all  
  
[Chorus]  
Remind me to smile  
You know, 'the old friends' line  
It gets so I feel like  
I'm in this cold, glass, cage  
  
I've got the horrors  
Check, over my shoulder  
I punch the air and fight but  
No-one's there  
  
You you oh no  
Old scars don't show  
We fall you see  
Crawl crawl in love  
I dive so clean  
Young things don't scream  
Toys toys so far  
Boys boys you are  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Get off the car  
Get off the phone  
Move from my window, leave me alone  
  
Keep your revivals  
Keep your conventions  
Keep all your fantasies that's all we are

It was hard to avoid  
I suppose it was the shame  
But they didn't even try  
You see we'd never met  
And they didn't have names  
There was nothing I could do  
  
So I turned on the crowd  
And I screamed 'you and you'  
'It could have been you'  
And they seemed to think  
That I looked that way  
Or maybe I was wrong  
  
So I said  
Do you know Mr. wall  
And they looked the other way  
And then they smiled at me  
  
But the police came  
And I said it was me  
And I just walked away

That's OK  
If that's the way you wanna play it  
I don't mind  
I can play it anyway  
You won't stop  
Until I pul you to pieces  
Which I will in time  
But I'm still curious  
You're so young  
Not one backbone between you  
But you think you'll make a hero  
Quite peculiar  
You're just boys  
You don't know what you've angered  
Did you know you're talking to the heart  
Of the machine?  
Welcome boys  
Welcome to the real world  
I could almost be sorry  
But I could be wrong  
I know you  
I know what you've been doing  
I know where you live  
And I know where you are  
You know me  
I'm the smiling assassin  
You know I won't forgive  
And you know I won't forget  

I'll get down on my knees  
I'll do anything I can  
I'll even walk upon water  
I'll burn the soul of a man  
I'm so sick with pain  
I'm so sick with need  
I'll lay before the cross and pray  
I've done nothing to you  
I'll bleed like holy rain  
I'll say I'm searching for the truth  
I'll rip the skin from God's face  
If it can guide me to you  
I'll give life to disease  
I'll steal the light from Heavens gate  
I'll give life to obsession  
And then I'll do as I please  
I'll give you one last sin or cure  
I've got something for you  
  

The new law is moving in  
Now you see them now you don't  
Like a Shadow in my diguise  
Like a soft machine on ice  
Who are you?  
'I'm the man  
I am the cure and disease'  
Who am I?  
I'm the need  
I am the weakness that feeds  
I've got to rip it up  
I've got to tear it down  
I've got to break the word  
I've got to fight for you  
Who am I to criticise  
I'm unsafe at any speed  
'We can change the world' she said  
Never changed it never tried  
I'm cold and hard  
But I don't mind  
I've been everything I can be  
I've been sick  
And I've got he screams  
These boys don't know when to push  
Did you know that I don't run  
Did you know that I don't hide  
Did you know that I don't sleep  
Did you know that I don't care  
I am the soft machine  
I am the word and the law  
I am the new machine  
I am your feelings and more  
Come inside and Play with me  
I'll show you things to forget  
No-one talks  
And no-one leaves  
No-one remembers the way  
I've got to fight the man  
I've got to fight the need  
I've got to fight the law  
I've got to fight the word  

I listen to rumours  
Stone cold and bleeding  
They burn my heart away  
Left me alone and afraid  
Words seem to leave me  
Just when I needed them  
Just like I need you  
Like I'm supposed to do  
They say:  
Love is deceiving  
She won't stay forever  
Love is deceiving  
Is all that she knows  
Love is deceiving  
She'll leave you forever  
Love is deceiving  
She comes and she goes  
I wonder  
I wonder  
I listen to rumours  
Listen to everyone  
Everyone but you  
And now it's all too late  

I would take your place  
If your world fell down  
I would take your pain  
And leave a smile  
For you  
  
If you feel a kiss  
When your dreams are dark  
And a voice guides you home  
When you are lost  
That was me  
  
Sometimes love breaks my heart [Repeat: x1]  
  
I will keep you warm  
And I'll wipe your tears away  
I'm a shadow  
Watching over you  
All my life  
  
I would die for you  
I would give the world to you  
And I'd sell my soul to keep you safe  
I love you  
  
Sometimes love breaks my heart [Repeat: x1]  
  
And when God comes for me  
I won't go far  
Like a smile in your heart  
I won't be far away  
  
If you're afraid and need to find me  
I'll be here with you  
And when you dream and hear me calling  
You'll see me again  
  
Sometimes love breaks my heart [Repeat: x1]

I'm not  
Crawling around  
Looking for a friend.  
I'm not  
Thinking the big I am.  
I'm not  
Down on the ground  
Looking for a cure.  
I'm not  
Saying that I'm the man.  
  
And I'm not asking for your opinion.  
I'm not asking for a miracle.  
And I'm not asking you to remember me,  
Not asking for the ghost to call.  
  
I'm  
Cold and corrupt  
Looking for a heart.  
I'm  
Trying to hide my scars.  
I'm  
Talking to you  
Like a shadow in the dark.  
I'm  
Just trying to survive.  
  
(Call my name, hide my shame)  
I call this human emotion.  
(Save my soul, save my soul)  
I call this human corrosion.  
  
And I'm not asking you for emotion,  
I'm not asking for the sky to mend.  
And I'm not asking you for nostalgia,  
I'm not asking for the world to end.  
And I'm not asking for your opinion,  
I'm not asking for a miracle.  
And I'm not asking you to remember me,  
Not asking for the ghost to call

You are distraction  
Like pictures on the wall  
I don't like eyes  
  
You are attraction  
It gets to be routine  
You're up, I'm down  
  
She's got claws  
But the factory knows  
We're dreams in cold storage  
We could dance the night away  
  
You say you love me  
Maybe you do  
A patience I can't steal  
I don't believe you  
You said 'Straight'  
It's like giving up hope  
  
Here on the ground  
On the floor  
Screaming nothing at all  
Here on the ground  
Like some whore  
Looking down on you all  
Too much advice  
I'm not sure  
  
Laughing hyenas  
With pens for charm  
You'll just suck in the boys  
We have to leave soon  
Shudder. 'The Door'  
This house is far too cool  
  
She's got claws  
But the factory knows  
We're dreams in cold storage  
We could dance the night away

We are  
Walking nostalgia  
Like old movies for real  
Look at me, look at you  
Look at them, look at us  
  
I'm young  
Sell a slim body to the man next door  
Sell a slim body to the man next door  
Like my sister surprise  
  
We'll wait for you  
  
We are  
The pleasure creation  
Gone wrong. gone wrong.  
  
We are  
Walking ghost stories  
No religion  
No relief  
No old wisdom  
No belief  
Sometimes I could scream  
  
We'll wait for you

You can cry by my window  
You can crawl on the floor  
You can scream if you want to  
But I won't unlock the door  
  
You can sleep in bus shelters  
You can sleep in the park  
But I'll rip up the trees  
Until you tear yourself apart  
  
But I don't love you  
No I don't love you  
Do you dream?  
  
Back to surveillance  
Open eyes and wash out 'tear'  
A sign that says 'no exit'  
And 'no-one can save you here'  
  
I could talk about my programme  
Where everything is white  
I could specialize in pictures  
Where nothing's ever right  
  
But I don't love you  
No I don't love you  
Do you dream?  
  
We are just sound  
We are just noise  
And we are all here to lie  
Do you dream?  
  
You sleep by windows  
You sleep by windows  
  
Do you cry?  
Do you dream?  
Do you?  
Did you?

She'll take a slowcar to China  
She'll pay the rent for the use of you  
She'll take a slowcar to China  
She'll pay the rent for the use of you tonight.  
  
We are not afraid to love, but no new ideas  
You almost get used to such things you know.  
The mechanics on the phone again, we break down.  
The others you'd remember if I could spare some time.  
  
In love with this elegant bitch  
And here am I just a shy young fool  
In love with this elegant bitch  
She only sparkles at times for you tonight.  
  
She forgets that we know,  
She forgets who we are  
  
I suppose the things I overheard were quite by chance  
The only story I ever knew or cared for  
Best left unheard I suppose, don't you?  
You look for somewhere to start to look  
  
We'll take a slowcar to China  
Everything that you need is here  
We'll take a slowcar to China  
Everything that you need is here tonight.  
  
I forgot not to call,  
And now we're out of love.  
  
She'll take a slowcar to China  
A little green worm inside my head  
She'll take a slowcar to China  
A little green worm inside my head tonight.  
  
There's nothing much to keep us alive, but 'Dance'.  
All that she can say is goodbye. All things change I suppose  
We'll sing without voice, without heart and leave no address  
I well never ever see you again. I know.  
  
Don't take a slowcar to China  
She needed nothing and no one so  
Don't take a slowcar to China  
She needed nothing and no one here tonight.  
  
You will pay like before.  
Always one step behind.  
You will pay Mr Jones.  
Always one step away.  
  
There's no one here to leave you behind but me.  
  

Memories lost in the faded films  
Of my life  
And a friend that used to be  
Something special to me  
Red wine and good times  
If you don't feel at all  
There is no point in going on tonight  
Something's in the house  
Something's on the stairs  
War's in the air  
The queer is out of order  
And me I'm on the ground  
But that's no place to be  
  
Jack Burroughs says "what you doing"  
"Oh me I'm going home"  
"Oh what a shame"  
Nothing has changed  
And nothing is new  
These days

She sits in the corner  
Where it's reasonably quiet  
Drinking coffee with cream  
Thinking stories of young love  
She calls to the waiter  
'Won't you lend me some time?  
You can sit by my side  
And I'll let you be friends with mine.'  
  
The cafe is old  
But the candlelight's new  
She orders Beaujolais wine  
And says 'I've thought of you too'  
  
She whispers 'isn't it odd  
You remind me of songs  
That I'd rather forget  
Like feelings I longed for  
  
You haunt me inside  
Sometimes I recall  
Question mistakes  
Who grew to nothing at all'  
  
I hear voices that cry  
And one of them's mine  
All the things I could say  
Are the reasons I can't  
She says 'I've seen you before  
In thoughts I call 'son'  
Like an old film with sound  
When the link comes undone'  
  
The waiter is me  
And the woman is you  
And we are the story  
Just like others I knew

Where is my outline I start to fade  
No concentration means 'fail' these days  
  
I leave the table saying 'i am real'  
I feel the pressure like your eyes on me  
Don't mention that name and books on love  
I can't be sure, I can't be sure  
  
You end on reel one  
You end on reel one  
  
You quote from 'anxious' and things we do  
I need protection from the likes of you  
  
Do you begin to see that I don't know  
I live on memories that are hard to find  
Send me a card and write 'i think of you'  
I'll say you lied, I'll say you're lying  
  
You are, you are  
  
Tell me a secret I'm sure to fall  
My dog runs a.w.o.l. I blame you all  
  
We're in formation saying 'safe, safe, safe'  
Turn up my collar and mix with dark  
The speaker turns on me spot her eyes  
It's hard to breathe, it's hard to breathe  
  
You end on reel one  
You end on reel one  
  
You are, you are

I look up and the camera eye is  
Searching my room  
The t.v. screen is calling me  
But for what or whom  
Please mister do be careful  
I'm so fragile  
Maybe they'll let me down  
To speedy's place for a while  
  
Oh well that's too bad  
Oh well that's too bad  
  
I talk a lot, a sign of fear,  
I thought you should know  
I can see pictures of me well  
They're so-so  
I'll come on to the leader  
Like I'm some hero  
He'll laugh and raise his dying eyes  
And just tell me to go  
  
1920 flashbacks for an hour or more  
Of crazy actors hiding  
In the doorways top floor  
Machines scream in anger  
From a thousand dead ends  
I turn my face, I crawl away,  
I look for a friend

Listen good  
Don't cry for me  
Don't cry anymore  
  
Now just shut your mouth  
This point of view  
Appeals to me  
  
Listen babe  
Say you've got no-one tonight  
  
Same old smile  
That cracked a thousand hearts  
But not mine  
  
Same old line  
I've read the book  
And I know you well  
  
Listen babe  
Say you've got no-one tonight  
  
What's this feeling  
That I don't believe  
No concern on my face  
  
What's it for  
You dream of something  
Like I dreamed of you  
  
Listen babe  
Say you've got no-one tonight

I won't pray here  
Or bow my head  
I won't praise your name  
I won't kneel down  
  
I won't pray to you  
On this side of sane (Oh Lord)  
I won't pray to you  
On this side of hell (Father)  
I won't pray to you  
On this side of heaven again  
  
I don't need faith  
Forgiveness of sin  
I don't need saving  
I don't need lies  
  
I don't believe  
In the angel wars (Oh Lord)  
I don't believe  
In the virgin birth (Father)  
I don't believe  
In the cross on the hill (Jesus)  
I don't believe  
In the kindness of God to man  
  
I'll drive a stake  
Through the black of your heart (Oh Lord)  
I'll pull down your temples  
And burn every word (Father)  
I'll kill all the angels  
That show me 'The Light' (Jesus)  
I'll drift into darkness  
And tear out the soul of God

Here in my room  
Where the paint dries like your face  
I'm still confusing love with need  
Tonight at 10  
I'll cry for a while  
They'll get me for sure  
It's just a question of time  
  
We're the crazies  
Some things I do  
I feel so ashamed  
But I have run of points of view  
The man is a thinker  
Who thought that he died  
Just sits in the corner  
Looking somewhat surprised  
  
We're the crazies  
I only exterminate  
In my spare time  
I fight the machine for the passers by  
I know I'm wrong  
But what makes you right  
The simple solution is to end it all  
  
We're the crazies

The dream police  
Slogan: what is on your mind?  
The airwave boys  
Junkies won't get radio time  
The purist league  
White trenchcoats in pre-war style  
The aging queens  
Mister won't you stay a while?  
  
In death row with harlow  
And others like you  
I point my finger of hate  
At your picture and love you and love you  
The radio is talking  
Is it you or me?  
I must admit  
It's far too late to dial police  
  
What is your name?  
We are the end of the line  
Her eyes went out  
Dreaming overdose on time  
Hey you old grey eyes  
Don't practice dying for real  
The only one  
September she knows I can feel

I intrude on patience  
I intrude on young hearts  
I intrude on all such things  
That can take you by surprise  
Time and time again  
So?  
  
I've no welcome for you  
I've no welcome for talk  
I've no welcome in my house  
I've tried too long you know  
Time and time again  
  
Oh look there's a man inside  
The head's not the museum it's supposed to be  
We sleep with machines that breathe  
And some even have names the executive dream  
  
We're all so sincere  
I'll sing a song from the film that broke your heart  
Oh look at the smile that cracks  
Tomorrow we'll be civilized  
And buy the whole world clothes  
  
We don't believe in you  
We're specialized mechanics in repairing the bitch  
You bounce around my head  
You say it's a little but I'm sure it's ok

Me I've just died  
But some machine keeps on humming  
I'm just an extra piece of dead meat to keep running  
Why won't you let me die in peace?  
Why won't you let me die with some kind of honor?  
Why won't you let me die at all?  
I know  
You've got your principles  
  
My body lies immobile  
I left it days ago  
And me I watch from somewhere as the loved ones come and go  
I see them glancing at the switch  
I hear them whispering maybe it's better that way  
I see the love turn into feelings  
I know  
Aren't quite the same  
  
I see the men of learning  
Pacing to and fro  
But how can I expect the sane to ever know?  
I'd rather die than have no mind  
I know my brain is gone damaged beyond repair  
I see an empty shell below me  
I know  
I've had my time

I saw him turn on  
Like a machine in the park  
Saying 'please come with me'  
But you've been there before  
  
I saw him whirr away  
Into the night  
Like a nightmare on wheels  
Saying 'never again'  
  
I'd give it all up for you  
I'd even be a number just for you  
The strangest living boy  
You could ever wish to see  
  
'that's me'  
Yellowed newspapers  
Tell the story of someone  
'do you know this man? '  
  
Tomorrow the cure  
Only police ever  
See night time for real  
Turn on the light  
And cry 'no more, no more'  
  
I was standing outside your door  
Waiting for the grey men to go  
When my mind turned on me  
With a vengeance I had never known  
  
My own  
Everyone heard  
The voice on the radio  
Saying 'why move around  
  
And waste my time'  
There are no  
Independents anymore  
The tape is a circle  
But who really cares  
  
I saw you behind the wall  
I even heard you laugh at me  
You disgust me tonight  
With your answer to something new  
That's you

Final bow  
In a disused music hall  
Of laughter and mime  
The airwave police  
Were the only  
Admirers to admire  
  
Sliding sideways in a rusty old Ford  
The drivers broke down and  
A young girl screams  
Walking through rock dreams  
Tall stories  
Mobile T.V. radio  
Nobody came  
  
The station is abandoned  
Deserted for peace day  
Some old man said 'Just do your best'  
And I think passed away  
  
My shadow is never far behind  
And I must find another role to play  
Visit maskmaker  
Please bend my mind  
Someone, no one  
I really don't mind  
Nobody cares  

Get the need  
Get it.  
I'm in the movies.  
  
Hello young thing  
I'm an old film star  
Maybe you've seen my picture.  
  
I need it  
Like an old newsreel  
I'm just fading away.  
  
Bang bang dear  
I've got the needles  
And I've got the need  
If you'd be so kind.  
  
Come on and feel the need in me  
Come on and feel the need.  
Feel it!  
  
Hello young thing  
I've got reverse instructions  
In the back of my car.  
  
I need it  
Don't cry till this thing is over  
And my friends applaud.  
  
Bang bang dear  
When can we do this again  
And put it all on film  
  
Hello young love  
I've got something to show you  
And please don't be ashamed.  
  
I'm the man  
I'm the atrocity film star  
And I've got the need.  
  

The sound of breathing  
"Protect the disease in me" she says  
The sound of breathing  
I have never known fear like this before  
  
I remember  
"The Beauties's old but still as good" she said  
I remember  
That I woke up in a cold dark room again  
  
We are new men  
We're the service, the pleasure skin  
We are new men  
No words, no image, no hope and fame  
  
No shelter  
You could feel the bitch outside the door  
No shelter  
She said "nothing is leaving here alive"  
  

I'm a ghost in the dark and I'm yours.  
I belong in the past and I'm yours.  
Like a song you forget, and I'm yours.  
Like a dream in the night, and I'm yours.  
  
The wrong place?  
The wrong time?  
I don't know.  
The wrong face?  
Yours or mine?  
I don't know.  
  
Like a tear when you sleep, I'll be yours.  
Like a scar that won't fade, I'll be yours.  
Like a pain in the cold, I'll be yours.  
Like a fear in the heart, I'll be yours.  
  
The wrong word when you cry  
I will be  
Like the seed of a lie  
I will be  
Like the germ of disease  
I will be  
Like the last one who cared  
I will be  
  
Like your shadow  
I will haunt you  
Do you remember?  
I said to you  
'Love is a mountain  
But harder to climb.  
It should be forever  
But love is unkind  
To me.  
Don't let me down.'  
  
And you let me down

Look at your face  
It's so fortunately arranged  
Don't look back  
I can assure you that you won't like what you see  
  
You step on my dreams  
I could whisper  
You intrude on me  
I could whisper  
You close in and I'm so uneasy  
  
Hotel rooms, sweet dreams  
Like slot machines that call it 'Love love'  
A coin in the hole  
You young things never stay young for longe  
  
This edge in my voice  
But there's really nothing much to say  
My conscience mends  
I suppose it all meant something to you.  
  
You step on my dreams  
I could whisper  
You intrude on me  
I could whisper  
You close in and I'm so uneasy  
  

This is  
This is emotion calling  
Inside  
You don't love me  
One game  
A miracle of invention  
You lose  
These rules are mine  
Dirty pictures  
For real  
The movies  
Move in  
Move out  
I'm in slow motion  
One love  
One tear  
One night  
Of fear  
One game  
You lose  
This is  
Emotion  
Look left  
There's nothing over there but vengeance  
Look right  
There's nothing over there but greed  
Look up  
There's nothing up there but rumours  
Look down  
There's nothing down there but me  
Dirty pictures  
For real  
The movies  
Move in  
Move out  
I'm in slow motion  
One love  
One tear  
One night  
Of fear  
One game  
You lose  
This is  
Emotion  
I'm listening to stories  
Of love and affection  
That I don't believe  
I'm listening to liars  
With pretty young faces  
And eyes that deceive  
One love  
I don't want to talk about it  
One love  
More pain  
I don't want to think about it  
More pain  
Dirty pictures  
For real  
The movies  
Move in  
Move out  
I'm in slow motion  
One love  
One tear  
One night  
Of fear  
One game  
You lose  
This is  
Emotion  
Dirty pictures  
For real  
The movies  
Move in  
Move out  
I'm in slow motion  
One love  
One tear  
One night  
Of fear  
One game  
You lose  
This is  
Emotion  
  
I'm listening to stories  
Of love and affection  
That I don't believe  
I'm listening to liars  
With pretty young faces  
And eyes that deceive  
One more  
Another night to remember  
One more  
Another name to forget  
One more  
Another young heart to play with  
One more  
Another young heart to break  
  
Artist Gary Numan  
Album Metal Rhythmn (LP)  
Song This Is Emotion  

We are strangers here  
I suppose  
We are not welcome  
Or so I'm told.  
We are not old friends  
But believe this,  
We can be nightmares.  
  
Picture the man when the heartbeat stops  
This is new love.  
  
We are the hunters,  
So one by one  
You know we'll find you.  
  
Picture the man when the heartbeat stops  
  
These boys of passion  
Will rule the world  
Put their fingers in a dyke  
Well you know it's what she needed.  
These boys of passion  
With cruel idiot smiles  
Fight for you.  
You know, they said so.  
  
Cold fascination  
With dead sound.  
Oh God let me sleep  
Forever.  
  
Picture the man when the heartbeat stops

And what if God's dead?  
We must have done something wrong  
This dark facade ends  
We're independent from someone  
  
This wreckage I call me  
Would like to frame your voice  
This wreckage I call me  
Would like to meet you,  
Meet you  
Soon  
  
We write suggestions  
Suggesting fading to silence  
And that must please you  
My mirror's tarnished with no-help  
  
This wreckage I call me  
Would like to frame your voice  
This wreckage I call me  
Would like to meet you,  
Meet you  
Soon  
  
Turn out these eyes  
Wipe off my face  
Erase me  
  
Replay the end  
It's all just show  
Erase you  
  
I need to  
I need to  
I need to  
  
This wreckage I call me  
Would like to frame your voice  
This wreckage I call me  
Would like to leave you,  
Leave you  
Leave you,  
Leave you soon

Sometimes I feel  
I live like a prisoner  
But I don't know  
If this really is pressure  
Surprise you win  
I'm lost as screamers roll in  
Sometimes I feel  
Like leaving this room I'm in  
  
Faded film people dropping words  
About the real things to say  
? (Not "Someone pulls me deeper", as in CD booklet)  
And tells me who I will be if I stay  
A clever machine writes pretty words  
For pretty boys  
To sing to us all  
We're all so grateful  
  
My face you cry  
And I show my darker side  
The night is yours  
And I just switch off and hide  
Cafe and sin  
The wine's not to my liking  
My face you cry  
Oh my didn't I say come in?  
  
Frown (?) in my eyes showing nothing  
But surprise about you  
And what are you thinking  
About my life and her drinking to you too  
A dying non-human writes unkind words  
For unkind friends  
And as for the tears, they'll never show  
Asylum people calling on my door  
From day to day  
The image must fall  
I've had my time  
more Gary Numan Lyrics  

And I have seen wonders  
And I have seen miracles  
Oh, I have seen some things  
It's all lost to me now  
Like tears in the rain  
  
And I have seen sadness  
And I have seen time run out  
I've even seen men cry  
It's all lost to me now  
Like tears in the rain  
  
And my memories  
I can't give them away  
So it's easy  
Like a long long sleep  
  
I'm so tired  
Now it's my time to die  
Welcome home  
Welcome home  
  
No exhibition  
No screaming war songs  
No conversation  
No more opinions here  
  
And I have seen new wars  
And I have seen things  
That you wouldn't believe  
And I have seen my days  
It's all lost to me now  
Like tears in the rain

Tread careful  
Because you're treading on my dreams.  
Tread careful  
Because I've just one heart  
Tread careful  
Let me down slowly  
Or I'll forget how to dream.  
Chorus:  
I won't forget anything  
(I love you)  
I won't forgive anyone  
(Do you love me?)  
Tread careful  
You hear the sound of my breathing  
Tread careful  
Because I feel this sound  
Tread careful  
I'm falling in a glasshouse  
I'm trying hard to begin  
Because I want it to get harder  
Tread careful  
Before I change my mind  
Tread careful  
I could surprise you  
I know something you want to do.  
(repeat chorus)  
Tread careful  
I'm sure you don't care but  
Tread careful  
I could change your mind  
Tread careful  
I've been waiting for you  
There is no comfort in here.  
(repeat chorus)  
  

Got to pull it up  
Got to pull it out  
Got to survive  
Got to stay calm  
Got to think fast  
Don't want to burn  
Searching for a door  
Searching for a way  
Out of this thing  
I don't know what's wrong  
Don't know what to do  
I'm out of control  
Nothing I can do  
Nothing seems to work  
I'm barely alive  
Got to slow it down  
Got to do something  
Or give in  
Watching us fall  
Trying everything  
Fighting for life  
Running out of time  
I don't have a choice  
I'm riding it in  
I'm inside and I'm trying to get out  
I'm inside and I'm screaming for some help  
And everything's gone wrong  
I'm listening to the sound of my own fear  
I'm listening to the sound of someone's tears  
I'm listening to me  
This is the fear  
This is nothing like  
You could believe  
Panic in my heart  
Like a cold hand  
Pulling at strings  
I'll do anything  
Even pray to God  
Just let me out  
Turn off the machine  
Turn off all the noise  
Turn off the world  
I'm inside and I'm trying to get out  
I'm inside and I'm screaming for some help  
And everything's gone wrong  
I'm listening to the sound of my own fear  
I'm listening to the sound of someone's tears  
I'm listening to me  
I'm inside and I'm trying to get out  
I'm inside and I'm screaming for some help  
And everything's gone wrong  
I'm listening to the sound of my own fear  
I'm listening to the sound of someone's tears  
I'm listening to me  
You learn fast when everything breaks down  
You learn fast when that's all that you can do  
You learn fast or nothing  

You walked in  
I woke up  
I've never seen a pretty girl look so tough baby  
You got that look  
Color you peach and black  
Color me taken aback  
Crucial  
I think I wantcha  
  
You've got the look  
You've got the hook  
you sho'nuf do be cookin' in my book  
Your face is jammin'  
Your body's heck a slammin'  
If love is good  
Let's get to rammin'  
You got the look  
You got the look  
  
You got the look  
You must a took  
A whole hour just to make up your face baby  
Closin' time, ugly lights,  
Everybody's inspected  
But you are a natural beauty unaffected  
Did I say an hour?  
My face is red  
I stand corrected  
  
You walked in  
I woke up  
I've never seen a pretty girl look so tough baby  
You got that look  
Yes you do  
Color you peach and black  
Color me taken aback  
Baby  
Crucial  
I think I wantcha

I don't like young girls  
I don't like boys  
I like some bitch to scare me  
I like that noise  
I don't like secrets  
I don't like God  
I don't like people  
When they say I'm things I'm not  
I don't need opinions and rumours  
I don't need a voix in the dark  
I don't need to listen to strangers  
I don't need to tear out my heart  
One stranger  
One heartbeat  
One love is  
Forever  
One picture  
One morning  
One tear lasts  
Forever  
I like this motion  
I like this heat  
I like this breathing  
And I know I like this beat  
I like your whispers  
I like your screams  
I like your lies  
And I'm sure I'd like your dreams  
You don't need opinions and rumours  
You don't need a voix in the dark  
You don't need to listen to strangers  
You don't need to tear out your heart  
I'll show you pictures  
I'll make you cry  
I'll show you things you've done  
And then I'll ask you why  
I don't need heroes  
I don't need this name  
I don't need favours  
And I know I don't need fame  
We don't need opinions and rumours  
We don't need a voix in the dark  
We don't need to listen to strangers  
We don't need to tear out our hearts  
One reason  
One secret  
One lie is  
Forever  
One nightmare  
One rumour  
Your shame is  
Forever  

All my life  
They've been here.  
Waiting for you.  
Patiently.  
They want your tears to fall  
All they want is your purest sin  
All they want is your heart and soul  
They want to welcome you in  
Innocent,  
But they will lead you  
Back to me.  
They will seem  
All they need is one tortured soul  
They need walking shadows  
All they need is your last confession  
They need your pain to show me  
I'm waiting for the unforgiven  
Waiting for you to come home  
Waiting for sleep to come  
I waiting for my one obsession  
  
'Innocence is pain in disguse'  
They said.  
Now I believe  
  

I like new fashion  
I like old stories  
Like my sister used to tell  
This is the voice  
This is the picture  
I like romantics  
But I don't like Steven  
  
Old men love war songs  
Love Vera Lynn  
Old men love war songs  
Now I'm Vera Lynn  
  
I like the welcome  
I like my sunbed  
But it burns me alive  
I like old heroes  
I like old film stars  
Dirty pictures, snap snap  
I like intrusion  
When she's dressed in white  
A nervous bride  
I don't remember  
If she's black or white  
This is the heart  
  
Old men love war songs  
Love Vera Lynn  
Old men love war songs  
Now I'm Vera Lynn  
  
This could be it  
This could be nothing  
Will you remember  
When the sparkle dies down  
I like Ferraris  
I like the fame  
Appreciation in the strangest ways  
I could believe  
In such things for now  
Don't like to crash, climb, climb  
I like the dancer  
Like you're supposed to  
I'll keep my mouth shut  
But I don't like this  
  
Old men love war songs  
Love Vera Lynn  
Old men love war songs  
Now I'm Vera Lynn

I fall  
Down  
No control somehow  
  
No help  
Now  
My favour slides  
  
No one comes  
Here  
Now I'm feeding strangers  
  
Thin air  
Like cold death  
Here in my heart  
  
I fell for so long for you all  
I fell for so long for you  
I fell for so long for you  
  
Come in  
I'm the ghost  
Of the white faced clown  
  
She's gone  
Gone. I won't look back  
She's gone  
  
I'm old  
So old  
This infection of time  
  
My skin  
Age  
Shows no kindness to me  
  
I fell for so long for you all  
I fell for so long for you  
I fell for so long for you

We are young we can break  
Watch us fall  
We can take some train  
Down to the sea  
We are glass, we are glass  
We are real you can touch  
Just for now  
And then say  
'Hey you, which way is down'  
We are glass, we are glass  
  
We are strong we run though  
We have time  
And to you I'm just  
One of those boys  
We are glass, we are glass  
We are cold  
We're not supposed to cry  
But it's all just a thought  
So here am I  
We are glass, we are glass  
  
They run fast  
Impressions of the floors inviting  
Stay with me, stay with me  
They run past  
With telephones they scream  
Well would you turn all this down  
Turn all this down  
  
You are replaced you are you  
And our dreams are real  
And dreams are all we need  
We are glass, we are glass  
  
We slip down  
And old eyes don't cry for me  
'Cause I doubt I'm and I doubt you  
And never never going to doubt  
We are glass, we are glass  
  
They run fast  
Impressions of the floors inviting  
Stay with me, stay with me  
They run past  
With telephones they scream  
Well would you turn all this down  
Turn all this down

We are so fragile  
Advertising lies  
That are whiter than yours  
We are so fragile  
They could give us a war  
Just to keep us amused  
  
We are so fragile  
I could stay here inside  
And say 'It's all been done'  
We are so fragile  
Just pretend I never tried  
I'll leave up to you  
  
We are still so young  
And it must be wrong  
But I'll do it all the same  
We are really so shy  
There's nothing I can do  
Except believe in you  
  
We could always go home  
But everyone says  
This is the place to be  
We are so unnatural  
But you wouldn't understand  
You only deal with men

We have a random on the westside  
Personality malfunction  
He says I can't give you anything at all  
Just a room with a bad view of you  
  
He sent a letter to a downstat  
Saying sorry that I missed you  
But I can't think of anything to do  
He's addicted to the time track  
  
We have a technical  
We have a technical  
  
He's in a hotel where they all go  
Saying me, I've lost my memory  
It's so surprising  
Just how quickly things can end  
  
Like a hero on a platform of friends  
This table is so crowded  
With people that I don't know  
And I never really turn  
  
My thoughts on you  
So the image breaks down again  
  
We have a technical  
We have a technical  
  
I suppose it's very shady  
At least until the lights go out  
Advertising posters on the wall  
And the young ones singing softly  
  
Do they ever come back  
Or is it always at the wrong time  
I could crawl around the floor  
Just like I'm real  
And move a hand in front of my eyes  
  
We have a technical  
We have a technical

We are not  
What you've been waiting for  
We are not  
The things you need  
We are not  
Softly singing love songs  
All we are  
Here for is right  
Room for one more  
Here in this room  
We play games  
Room for one more  
Here in this room  
You can feel it all  
We need it  
To keep the shakes away  
We need it  
To help us breathe  
We need it  
For everything we feel  
We need it  
Like we need you  
-repeat chorus-  
We break down  
Start up the smile I suppose  
You learn quick  
You learn nothing  
One more girl  
Just leaves us wanting more  
This young love  
Just leaves us cold  
-repeat chorus-  

I could talk of memories  
I could talk of miracles  
I can't talk of anything but you  
I remember everything  
Even how you laughed at me  
I remember every word you said  
'Love is a game  
Love is a game that we play  
Love is a game  
Love is a game and you lose  
Welcome to Love'  
Now you're waiting for someone  
Waiting for the phone to ring  
And I wonder who you're waiting for  
There is nothing I can say  
There are no good words for this  
There is nothing more that I can do  
'Lovers are fools  
Lovers are foolish in the dark  
Lovers are fools  
Lovers are foolish and blind  
Welcome to Love'  

I thought I heard someone crying, thought I heard someone crying  
And I thought it was me  
I thought I heard someone screaming, thought I heard someone screaming  
  
I bleed for you. I bleed for, I bleed for  
I, I, I need something to live for  
Is this the end we're deserving?  
I, I, I need something to live for  
I'm on my knees and I'm begging  
  
Something's fallen from heaven, looks like a nightmare coming to haunt me  
I don't believe it  
Fallen from heaven, looks like a nightmare coming to save me  
I don't believe it  
  
I thought I saw the sky bleeding, thought I saw the sky bleeding  
And I thought I saw you  
I thought I saw oceans burning, thought I saw oceans burning  
And I thought I saw you  
  
I thought I saw angels falling  
Beautiful, but still falling down  
I bleed for you  
I bleed for  
I bleed for  
  
I, I, I gave you something to die for  
And this is how you betray me?  
I, I, I gave you something to die for  
And this is how you repay me?  
  
Something's falling from heaven, looks like a nightmare coming to haunt me  
I don't believe it  
Falling from heaven, looks like a nightmare coming to take me  
I don't believe it
