You were my ticket out of here  
And I was your dream come true  
You gave me everything I ever wanted  
Except for you  
  
I convinced myself that over don't mean over  
And I convinced myself that I could fix it all  
Two dreams collided  
And maybe we got too excited  
For our own good  
  
No more hold on we can make it  
No more holding each other while the words all break it  
Move on you know we'll be stronger in the end  
  
Now I convinced myself that nothing could ever tear me away  
And I convinced myself that we'd look back and laugh at this one day  
Two lives collided  
And maybe we got too excited  
For our own good  
  
No more hold on we can make it  
No more holding our breath while the truth all breaks it  
Move on you know we'll be stronger in the end  
  
Hey wait hey don't you know  
That this is where the whole thing went wrong  
Hey wait hey don't you want  
To hear what I have to say  
Hey wait hey don't you know  
This is where the strong will go on  
  
All I ever wanted  
All I ever wanted  
All I ever wanted  
Was you  
  
No more hold on we can make it  
No more holding each other while the world tries to break us  
Move on you know we'll be stronger in the end  
  
Hey wait hey don't you know  
That this is where the whole thing went wrong  
Hey wait hey don't you want  
To hear what I have to say  
Hey wait hey don't you know  
This is where the strong will go on  
  
All I ever wanted  
All I ever wanted  
All I ever wanted  
Was you

Always remember I'm by your side  
Such a shame that you had to go  
So much more that I'd like to know  
So many things you forgot to show me how to do  
  
When times are hard I forget your gone  
I go to call you before it dawns on me  
That you won't be there now  
But I still have these words that you gave me  
  
Always remember I'm by your side  
Always remember I'm by your side  
  
I got two kids of my own now  
They grow up so fast  
And how I wish you did not miss that part of who I am  
But I keep doing all that I can do  
And I will smile when they ask about you  
And I will sing to them every day  
With voice and the words that you used to say  
Will change the world one day  
  
Always remember I'm by your side  
Always remember I'm by your side  
  
And while they grow up you will show up  
In things they do and say  
Like a reflection to a connection  
Of who they'll be one day  
They will learn to get their wings  
And fly through the changes life will bring  
So on  
And it will go on  
And you will go on  
  
And they will sing with the voice that you gave them  
Always remember I'm by your side  
Always remember I'm by your side  
I'm by your side  
I'm by your side

California, dancin' in the ocean  
How I love you  
Better wear some lotion  
Sun is always shinin'  
No one compares to you  
  
Sittin' here baby  
Young and like a flower  
How I want you  
Gimme just an hour  
You seem like an angel  
No one compares to you  
  
You're the best book I ever read  
You're the smartest thing I ever said  
You're breakfast in bed  
  
When in no way  
You can do me more ways  
Than any other  
You treat me like you love me  
Like a mother loves her baby  
Baby do I do it for you  
Oh, 'cause all I ever wanted baby  
Baby was to do it for you  
  
You're the best dream in my head  
You're my calm thought when I see red  
You're better than punk rock red  
You're breakfast in bed  
You're breakfast in bed  
You're breakfast in bed  
  
Wanna please you  
Wanna Japanese you  
How I need you  
Dress you up and feed you  
Love you like a daddy loves his baby  
Baby do it for me  
  
You're the fastest race I ever led  
You're the finest bride I'll ever wed  
You're the skin I never wanna shed  
You're breakfast in bed  
You're breakfast in bed  
You're breakfast in bed

The dust has finally settled down  
The sun is shining on  
These pieces that are scattered all around  
This house was everything we knew  
It's where we kept our love  
And every single memory of me and you  
Every letter, every note,  
Every dress you never wore under your coat  
Thrown away  
  
Brick by brick,  
We can build it from the floor  
If we hold onto each other,  
We'll be better than before.  
And brick by brick,  
We will get back to yesterday  
When I made your body shiver  
And when you took my breath away,  
You took my breath away.  
  
The sky has made it back to blue,  
Everything that's left  
Is telling us the worst of it is through.  
Home has never felt so right,  
There's nothing in the way.  
There's nothing in between us  
Knowing where we're going is inside.  
Every letter that I wrote,  
Every dress you never wore under your coat  
Thrown away  
  
Brick by brick,  
We can build it from the floor  
If we hold on to each other,  
We'll be better than before.  
And brick by brick,  
We'll get back to yesterday.  
When I made your body shiver  
And when you took my breath away.  
  
All the pictures that we've taken  
And the songs that we have played  
That have all kept track and  
Followed back the love that we have made.  
Now they're spread out on the surface  
Where we can try to congregate  
It's not too late,  
To believe that we can get it all again  
  
Brick by brick,  
We can build it from the floor,  
If we hold onto each other,  
We'll be better than before.  
And brick by brick,  
We'll get back to yesterday  
When I made your body shiver  
And when you took my breath away,  
You took my breath away.  
  
Brick by brick  
We'll get back to yesterday,  
When I made your body shiver and  
When you took my breath away,  
You took my breath away.

Haven't seen you since high school  
Good to see you're still beautiful  
Gravity has its solitude oh  
Quite yet, I bet you're rich as hell  
  
One that's five and one that's three  
Been two years since he left me  
Good to know that you got free  
That town I know was keeping you down on your knees  
  
These bruises make for better conversation  
Loses the vibe that separates  
It's good to let you in again  
You're not alone in how you've been  
Everybody loses, we all got bruises  
We all got bruises  
  
Have you seen him? Not in years  
How about her? No but I hear  
She's in Queens with the man of her dreams  
Funny back then she said that about you  
  
Caesura you'll never guess who I saw  
Remember Johnny B remember him we were best friends, back to be  
Let's do this soon again, ten years is that what it's been?  
Can't believe how time flies by  
Leaving you makes me wanna cry  
  
These bruises make for better conversation  
Loses the vibe that separates  
It's good to let you in again  
You're not alone in how you've been  
Everybody loses, we all got bruises  
We all got bruises  
  
I would love to fix it all for you  
I would love to fix you too  
Please don't fix a thing whatever you do  
  
These bruises make for better conversation  
Loses the vibe that separates  
It's good to know you've got a friend  
That you remember now and then  
Everybody loses  
  
These bruises make for better conversation  
Loses the vibe that separates  
It's good to let you in again  
You're not alone in how you've been  
Everybody loses,everybody loses, everybody loses  
We all got bruises, We all got bruises, We all got bruises

New York snow this time of year  
There's nothing more beautiful to me  
Except for you  
  
Making my way uptown and down  
Seeing familiar places, faces  
In my pile of coffee grounds  
  
The days are better the nights are still so long  
Sometimes I think I'm the only cab on the road  
Sometimes I think I'm the only cab on the road  
  
Watching my breath rise in the sun  
Pulling myself in to make warm  
Helplessly feel for my phone and drive away  
  
This new rhythm I pursue  
Is just my gettin' over you  
Telling myself that I need to  
  
The days are better the nights are still so long  
Sometimes I think I'm the only cab on the road  
Sometimes I think I'm the only cab on the road  
  
I'm still looking for a fare, no one said that it was fair  
To be alone  
  
The days are better the nights are still so long  
Sometimes I think I'm the only cab on the road  
The days are better the nights are still so long  
Sometimes I think I'm the only cab on the road  
Sometimes I think I'm the only cab on the road

I need a sign to let me know you're here  
All of these lines are being crossed over the atmosphere  
I need to know that things are gonna look up  
'Cause I feel us drowning in a sea spilled from a cup  
  
When there is no place safe and no safe place to put my head  
When you feel the world shake from the words that are said  
  
I need a sign to let me know you're here  
'Cause my TV set just keeps it all from being clear  
I want a reason for the way things have to be  
I need a hand to help build up some kind of hope inside of me  
  
And I'm calling all angels  
I'm calling all you angels  
  
When children have to play inside so they don't disappear  
And private eyes solve marriage lies cause we don't talk for years  
And football teams are kissing Queens  
And losing sight of having dreams  
In a world that what we want is only what we want until it's ours  
  
I'm calling all angels  
I'm calling all you angels

On the other side of a street I knew  
Stood a girl that looked like you  
I guess that's deja vu  
But I thought this can't be true  
'Cause you moved to west L.A or New York or Santa Fe  
Or where ever to get away from me  
  
Oh but that one night  
Was more than just right  
I didn't leave you cause I was all through  
Oh I was overwhelmed and frankly scared as hell  
Because I really fell for you  
  
Oh I swear to ya, I'll be there for ya  
This is not a drive by  
Just a shy guy looking for a two ply  
Hefty bag to hold my love  
When you move me everything is groovy  
They don't like it sue me, mm way you do me  
Oh I swear to you, I'll be there for you  
This is not a drive by  
  
On the other side of a downward spiral  
My love for you went viral  
And I loved you every mile you drove away  
But now here you are again  
So let's skip the "how you been"  
And get down to the "more than friends" at last  
  
Oh but that one night  
Is still the highlight  
I didn't need you until I came to  
  
And I was overwhelmed and frankly scared as hell  
Because I really fell for you  
  
Oh I swear to you, I'll be there for you  
This is not a drive by  
Just a shy guy looking for a two ply  
Hefty bag to hold my love  
When you move me everything is groovy  
They don't like it sue me, mm way you do me  
Oh I swear to ya, I'll be there for ya  
This is not a drive by  
  
Please believe that when I leave  
There's nothing up my sleeve but love for you  
And a little time to get my head together too  
  
On the other side of a street I knew  
Stood a girl that looked like you  
I guess that's deja vu  
But I thought this can't be true, 'cause  
  
Oh I swear to you, I'll be there for you  
This is not a drive by  
Just a shy guy looking for a two ply  
Hefty bag to hold my love  
When you move me everything is groovy  
They don't like it sue me, mm way you do me  
Oh I swear to ya, I'll be there for ya  
This is not a drive by

Scarlet your eyes, cover your face  
If I could dance, or stay in this place  
I would be King and you would be mine  
I would be day and you would be time  
Eggplant and Caviar for you  
For you for you for you  
Eggplant and Caviar for you  
Hold up my wings cause you are the sky  
Paint me by numbers and don't ask me why  
Cause I am in bloom and you are perfume  
And you are perfume and you are  
Eggplant and Caviar for you  
For you for you for you  
Eggplant and Caviar for you  
For you for you for you - ah  
Apple Pie or Apple seed,  
All the mouths that I must feed  
Cold sheets or Tumble weed  
All the ones that I must need  
I would be King and you would be mine  
I would be nine and you would be Mother Time  
Eggplant and Caviar for you, for you, for you  
Apple Pie or Apple seed,  
All the mouths that I must feed  
Cold sheets or Tumble weed  
All the ones that I must need  
All the ones that I must need

What's your explanation  
Cause everybody got one  
What's your expectation  
I know you got some of those too  
  
Are you one to fly with the creatures that always burn up in the flame  
Or are you one to sing with the creatures that make up the rules to the game  
  
I won't get hung up, strung up on the reasons why  
If you knew me better, baby you would change your mind  
And leave it all behind  
What's your explanation  
  
What's your favorite color, your sign  
Your basic sense of style and date of birth  
  
Who's gonna win your heart and when your heart's been won  
And when your hearts been won is it still your daddy first  
  
Are you one to dance to the rhythm or break till the pain shakes loose  
Or are you one to cry  
Oh, but you stay dry all night long  
  
I won't hung up, strung up on the reasons why  
If I knew you better, maybe I could change your mind  
If you knew me better, maybe you will change your mind  
And leave it all behind  
What's your explanation  
  
Are you one to fly with the creatures that always burn up in the flame  
Or are you one to sing with the creatures that make up the rules to the game  
  
What's your explanation  
What's your explanation  
What's your explanation  
Cause everybody got one  
Cause everybody got one  
Everybody got one

Here among the daffodils  
Underneath the coffee spills  
The dandelions decide to take a bit of your sunlight  
You think there's nothing beautiful  
Its simply being beautiful  
But everything you do is full of everything I love  
And you..... keep me fascinated  
Get it out and let me in  
While I'm not for burnin out I'm fadin away  
Somewhere underneath this sea of me  
There lies some poetry  
That said the perfect way, ring inside your ear for days  
And underneath some April shower  
Grows the perfect kind of flower  
I don't want perfection  
All I want is your reflection  
And I don't need perfection  
All I need is you  
Cause you, keep me fascinated  
Get it out and let me in  
While I'm not for burning out I'm fadin away  
Every petal over you  
Like a metal over you shines  
Every petal over you  
Like a metal over you, shines  
Youuuuu... keep me fascinated  
Get it out and let me in  
While I'm not not for burnin out, I'm fadin  
Youuuu..... keep me fascinated  
Get it out and let me in  
While I'm not for burnin out I'm fadin away

If I ever find truth I'm gonna let you know  
If I ever find faith I'm gonna sit in every bit of its afterglow  
If I ever find a way to bring love here today  
You better bet your life that this is what I'll say  
Give it if you've got it  
Get it if you don't  
  
Take my hand in the meantime  
And let's walk into the sunshine  
Everybody got something that they want to sing about, laugh about, cry about  
It's true  
For me it's you  
  
Give it away, give it away, give it away  
If it's something that you got layin' round your house  
Man let me tell ya if ain't a kiss  
It's something you'll never miss  
Give it to somebody that don't have a thing layin' round like a prayer or a
sweet sound  
Give it if you've got it  
Get it if you don't  
  
Take my hand in the meantime  
Let's walk into the sunshine  
Everybody got something that they want to sing about, laugh about, cry about  
It's true  
For me it's you  
  
Na na na na na na na na na  
For me it's you  
Na na na na na na na na na  
For me it's you  
Na na na na na na na na na  
For me it's you  
Na na na na na na na na na  
  
Give it to somebody that don't have a thing  
Ain't got soft shoes to dance or a love song to sing - no  
Get yourself on the right track  
Let somebody ride your back for a while  
  
If I ever find truth I'm gonna let you know  
You better bet your life if this is what I'm gonna say just give it away  
You can't take it where you're goin' anyway  
  
Take my hand in the meantime  
And let's walk into the sunshine  
Everybody got something they want to sing about, laugh about cry about it's
true  
For me it's you  
Na na na na na na na na

Well I climbed into my fathers shoes and felt like a loser  
Never had a chance to swim  
And all the things he'd say  
Came in from my grandpa's ways  
Always loved him  
  
But I don't want to be even more like that  
I'm afraid to be any more like that  
I don't know why I am saying this to you  
I guess that I am afraid to lose what I know about me and you  
For you  
  
So if I ever get the chance  
I wanna ask you to dance  
After thirty days I'm dry  
  
Climb into the Subaru, well only the best for you  
Maybe we can drive all night  
And I suppose that I could be your friend  
But I don't know if I can last till then  
  
Why you even bring this up right now?  
Maybe it's cause I'm in love and how  
With you  
For you  
  
And I don't even know why I feel so grey  
I didn't mean to be this way  
All I need is a chance to fight this through  
And I hope that I can fight for you  
For you  
For me  
For us

Home all night, nothing's wrong  
Just my nature got me holding on too tight  
So, you say you're on the way  
Got me feelin' like I should be holdin' on this tight  
  
I'm heavy on my knees  
Oh my, slip and slide  
Hope they gonna make you feel  
Like someday I will, I know  
'Cause every girl I know has to go out to dance  
Before my butterfly has it's chance to fly, fly, fly, fly, fly  
  
And I know that I'll fall in too deep  
And you'll wait till I fall asleep  
Before you fade away, fade away  
And I know that it won't take too long  
Before you find something wrong  
And fade away, fade away  
  
I'm heavy on my knees, yeah  
I'm heavy on my knees, yeah  
  
Oh you, what you do?  
Seems you got me feelin' like you want me to  
Fade  
But it's all right, how we'll be  
Nothing that you want from me  
Fade  
  
And I know that I'll fall in too deep  
And you'll wait till I fall asleep  
Before you fade away, fade away  
And I know that it won't take too long  
Before you go and find something wrong  
And fade away, fade away  
And I know that I'll fall in too deep  
And you'll wait till I fall asleep  
Before you fade away, fade away  
  
I'm heavy on my knees, yeah  
I'm heavy on my knees, yeah  
I'm heavy on, I'm heavy on  
I'm heavy on my knees, yeah

Hey, hey, hey  
  
Your lipstick stains on the front lobe of my left side brains  
I knew I wouldn't forget you, and so I let you go and blow my mind  
Your sweet moonbeam, the smell of you in every single dream, I dream  
I knew when we collided, you're the one I have decided who's one of my kind  
  
[Chorus]  
Hey soul sister, ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo,  
The way you move ain't fair, you know!  
Hey soul sister, I don't want to miss a single thing you do, tonight  
  
Hey, hey, hey  
  
Just in time, I'm so glad you have a one-track mind like me  
You gave my life direction, a game show love connection we can't deny  
I'm so obsessed, my heart is bound to beat right out of my untrimmed chest  
I believe in you, like a virgin, you're Mah Daughter  
And I'm always gonna wanna blow your mind  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well you can cut a rug, watching you's the only drug I need  
So gangsta, I'm so thug, you're the only one I'm dreaming of  
You see, I can be myself now finally, in fact there's nothing I can't be  
I want the world to see you'll be, with me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hey soul sister, I don't want to miss a single thing you do,  
Tonight  
Hey, hey, hey  
Tonight  
Hey, hey, hey  
Tonight

Hey, did you hear, about the one that got away,  
They say, he looked left,  
She turned right, meant to be together but not that night,  
It's when fate's running late, we tend to make mistakes,  
We go 'round and 'round, from love to love  
It's either way too much or not enough  
  
Gimme lazy days with nothing better to do  
Than singin' oh black water keep on rollin' while I wait for you  
I don't care if it rains, I'll be just fine,  
I'm leaving the ghosts behind until  
I got you, I got you  
You're the sun through my window, warming my skin  
Oh you, I got you  
Hey,  
  
Then when one of them was taken, the other one was waiting  
For the next big thing  
To bring them to the gates of heaven  
Or maybe just a late night in Vegas  
It's true, that's what we do when were going down swingin'  
Then coming up singing the blues  
Wearing out my shoes, chasing new faces to get to you  
  
Driving home on a summer night  
Singin' old black water  
Keep on rolling 'till the time is right  
I don't care if it rains, I'll be just fine  
Sit back enjoy the ride  
  
Until I got you, I got you  
You're the sun through my window  
Warming my skin, oh you I got you Like Sonny and Cher  
Except I'll be there for you, I got you  
Let old black water bring us together  
  
Old black water keep on rolling  
Mississippi moon won't you keep on shining on me  
Old black water keep on rolling  
Mississippi moon won't you keep on shining on me  
Wanna hear some funky Dixieland  
Pretty Mama come on take me by the hand,  
Wanna hear some funky Dixieland  
Pretty mama,  
Here she comes,  
  
I got you, I got you  
You're the sun through my window warming my skin,  
Oh you I got you  
Like Sonny and Cher you know I'll be there for you  
I got you, let old black water bring us together  
You, I got you, I got you , I got you baby  
By the hand hand take me by the hand  
Pretty mama dance with your daddy all night long  
Wanna hear some funky Dixieland  
Pretty mama come and take me by the hand  
By the hand hand, take me by the hand  
Pretty mama dance with your daddy all night long  
Wanna hear some funky Dixieland  
Pretty mama come and take me by the hand  
By the hand hand, take me by the hand  
Pretty mama dance with your daddy all night long  
Wanna hear some funky Dixieland  
Pretty mama come and take me by the hand

Sleepless nights and endless days  
And all I do is promise to change my ways  
Leave the lights on, you know I'll pretend you're on you're way  
You used to say that there's a time we all deserve to lose our minds  
So I lost my mind now I'm ready to find my way  
  
Back home  
Today  
To stay  
The way you wished I would  
And I swear  
To stay  
The way you wished I would  
  
I don't know if I'm gonna have to redesign my mind  
But tonight I made a wish and I sure hope that it comes true  
Cause it's been too long without you  
It's been too long  
  
Come home  
Today  
To stay  
The way you wished I would  
And I swear  
To stay  
The way I wish you would  
  
And even if I left it all behind  
There'd be reason to come back  
And even though I left you far behind  
I always thought that you'd come here to find me  
Come find me  
  
I don't know if I can wait this long  
To be what I used to be  
And I don't think I can wait much longer  
For the tide to come back to me  
Come back to me  
  
Back home  
Today  
To stay  
The way I wish you would  
And I swear  
To stay  
The way I wish you would  
The way I wish you would

Texas are you my friend, you live so close to the end  
Texas are you my friend, cause I'm afraid of you  
Hey Maine hey, you're a little too high for me  
And Fla you're just a little too low  
D.C. you could be the end of me  
I think I'm movin to Idaho  
I ain't afraid of you  
  
Oh, people on the outside lookin' in  
Mother Nature shakes, what then what then  
Oh, people on the outside lookin' through  
She'll shake you to Idaho, that's what she'll do  
Oh, oh Carolina Brother's you make me crawl under the covers  
I just can't get myself to go, oh no  
Hey Joe I see your name too, but there is nothin' that they can do  
I think I'm movin' to Idaho  
I ain't afraid of you  
  
Oh, people on the outside lookin' in  
Mother Nature shakes, what then what then  
Oh, people on the outside lookin' through  
She'll shake you to Idaho, that's what she'll do

Tears fill up my eyes  
I'm washed away with sorrow  
And somewhere in my mind  
I know there's no tomorrow  
  
I see that you're leaving soon  
I guess you've had your fill  
But if I can't change your mind, then no one will  
  
And all throughout all the years  
I've never strayed from you my dear  
You suspect I'm somewhere else  
You're feeling sorry for yourself  
  
Leaving with a broken heart  
I love you even still  
But if I can't change your mind, then no one will  
If I can't change your mind  
  
Even though my heart keeps breaking  
Don't you know that I'll be waiting here for you  
I hope you see I'm dedicated  
Look how long that I have waited  
If you come back you will find a different person  
If you change your mind  
  
How can I explain away somethin' I haven't done  
And if you cant trust in me now, you'll never trust in anyone  
With all the crazy doubts you've got  
I love you even still  
But if I can't change your mind, then no one will  
If I can't change your mind  
If I can't change your mind  
Wish I could change your mind

While everybody else is getting out of bed  
I'm usually getting in it  
I'm not in it to win it  
And there's a thousand ways you can skin it  
  
My feet have been on the floor  
Flat like an idol singer  
Remember winger  
I digress  
I confess you are the best thing in my life  
  
But I'm afraid when I hear stories  
About a husband and wife  
There's no happy endings  
No Henry Lee  
But you are the greatest thing about me  
  
[Chorus]  
If it's love  
And we decide that it's forever  
No one else could do it better  
If it's love  
And we're two birds of a feather  
Then the rest is just whatever  
And if I'm addicted to loving you  
And you're addicted to my love too  
We can be them two birds of a feather  
That flock together  
Love, love  
Got to have something to keep us together  
Love, love  
That's enough for me  
  
Took a loan on a house I own  
Can't be a queen bee without a bee throne  
I wanna buy ya everything  
Except cologne  
'Cause it's poison  
We can travel to Spain where the rain falls  
Mainly on the plain sounds insane  
'Cause it is we can laugh we can sing  
Have ten kids and give them everything  
Hold our cell phones up in the air  
And just be glad that we made it here alive  
On a spinning ball in the middle of space  
I love you from your toes to your face  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You can move in  
I won't ask where you've been  
'Cause everybody has a past  
When we're older  
We'll do it all over again  
  
When everybody else is getting out of bed  
I'm usually getting in it  
I'm not in it to win it  
I'm in it for you  
  
If it's love  
And we're two birds of a feather  
Then the rest is just whatever  
Then the rest is just whatever  
  
If it's love  
And we decide that it's forever  
No one else could do it better  
And if I'm addicted to loving you  
And you're addicted to my love too  
We can be them two birds of a feather  
That flock together  
Love, love  
Got to have something to keep us together  
Love, love  
Got to have something to keep us together  
Love, love  
That's enough for me

Sweet dreams from Texaco, and I know your mind is on  
It's way to Mexico, sweet Jesus is on his way to take  
You on his way down  
You get your fill of what you like and you fill your head  
With what you might want yourself to be when you're ready  
But if you leave  
It's gonna get a little easier to break down  
And if you leave  
It's gonna get a little bit easier for you to break down  
My new dress is your new way out, my new way is your new  
Dress, and you look fine  
But your new belief is my regret and my regret  
Leaves you to believe that we have found the line  
And if you leave  
Take me along, anywhere is ok  
And if you leave  
Take me along, anywhere is ok  
Think back and you can feel me movin' through you  
It's easy when you try  
Think back and you can feel me  
Well you won't feel me  
You can't feel me if you leave  
And if you leave  
You won't feel me

It's clear to see that you're down to earth  
With a hold on what your worth  
Like no other  
And I'd like to thank your mother for that  
  
I bet ya there's a line outside your door  
And it's a line I know for sure  
That you don't want from me  
Like a hole in your head  
  
I want to be just you just me  
No tricks, no show  
But I got to let you know  
  
I'm not waiting in line  
I'm not changing my mind for you  
I'm not wasting my time  
I'm not waiting in line for you  
  
Now I think if we got something started  
We would both fall in whole hearted  
I'm not like no other  
And you can thank my mother for that  
  
I'm sure there is a line in front of me  
And it's a line I'm sure to need from you  
Like a whole in my head  
  
I want to be just you just me  
No tricks, no show  
But I got to let you know  
  
I'm not waiting in line  
I'm not changing my mind for you  
I'm not wasting my time  
I'm not waiting in line for you  
  
I've been saving myself for you  
But I'm not wasting my time for no one  
Oh But if you want me to be  
Baby I'll be rough enough  
Baby I'll be tough enough  
Oh you know I'm rich enough  
But I won't be nobody's fool  
  
I'm not waiting in line  
And I'm not changing my mind for you  
I'm not wasting my time  
I'm not waiting in line for you  
  
I'm not waiting in line  
And I'm not changing my mind for you  
I'm not wasting my time  
I'm not waiting in line  
  
Unless you want me to

This ain't about the things I've done  
Where I've been or what I won  
Stand on your corner a thousand time  
Lose what I got keep what I find  
It's about you  
It's about you  
  
This ain't about the things you say  
Or how you make me feel this way  
Stand on your corner a thousand time  
Lose what I got keep what I find  
It's about you  
It's about you  
  
And when I get this feeling  
It's hard for me to come back down  
And when I get this feeling  
It's hard for me to come back down  
And I could be  
That everything you need  
And I know this could be  
That free fall back to me  
  
This ain't about the things I've done  
Where I've been or what I won  
Stand on your corner a thousand time  
Lose what I got keep what I find  
It's about you  
It's about you  
It's about you  
It's about you  
And when I get this feeling  
It's hard for me to come back down  
And when I get this feeling  
It's hard for me  
  
'Cause I could be  
That everything you need  
And I know this could be  
That free fall back to me  
  
But keeping you ain't easy  
With everyone that sees me  
Telling me get back on the ground  
It never could be easy  
Instead of you just pleasing me  
You're keeping me down  
And I know this could be  
That free fall  
Come on jump to me

It's love  
To my mind  
  
Well I drop myself on the cold cement  
Hang my head 'cause my woman's bent  
No lights on but I know that she's home  
So I ring the bell another forty time  
The neighbor dog made me lose my mind  
Now I see her car slide down the road  
  
It's love  
To my mind  
Yeah  
Yeah  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
I know how to get back to me  
I know how to get back to me  
  
Now I act as if I just got there  
From doing important shit somewhere  
But she don't seem impressed with me at all  
So I decided as I stood  
I'm done with this one now for good  
But I know as soon as I get home  
And see that I'm all by myself  
I'm gonna pick up the phone  
And tell her I would do anything to have her back again  
  
'Cause that's love  
To my mind  
Yeah  
Yeah  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
I know how to get back to me  
I know how to get back to me  
I know how to get back to me  
I know how to get back to me  
I know how to get back to me  
(got to get back to me)  
  
I know how to get back to me  
(got to get back to me)  
I know how to get back  
I know how to get back  
(got to get back to me)  
  
I know how to  
I know how to get back to me  
Yeah  
Yeah  
Yeah  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
I know how to get back to me  
(got to get back to me)  
I know how to get back to me  
(got to get back)

Well there ain't much entertainment  
In a town this size at all  
So I've got myself up, dressed for this arraignment  
Cause I don't think I'm ready for the fall  
  
Now I find my thoughts deep in this room all by myself  
Thinking the moon might just explode if I don't leave  
And the more I wait  
It seems the more I hate  
This town for what it's doing to me  
This is when I need you most of all  
  
Then I stepped upon a landmine  
And I saw my future rise  
I'm getting to know you  
Between the lines  
  
I dropped down to about one foot two  
Hoping to get more looks for you  
But it never made much difference in your eyes  
And I suppose that I couldn't help things much  
To set this day in a whirlwind rush  
After finding out the backseat changed our lives  
  
Then I stepped upon a landmine  
And I saw my future rise  
I'm getting to know you  
Between the lines  
Between the lines  
  
It's 5am and if I run  
I am sure to pay for what I've done  
And if I say I'm sure I wish I ran  
And though I knew this day would come  
I never thought that I would run  
For someone who was blind to me  
You're as blind to me as you could be  
  
Na na nana na  
Na na nana na  
Na na nana na  
Yeah  
  
Then I stepped upon a landmine  
And I saw my future rise  
I'm getting to know myself  
Between the lines  
Between the lines

She doesn't own a dress, her hair is always a mess  
If you catch her stealin', she won't confess  
She's beautiful, she smokes a pack a day, wait that's me, but anyway  
She doesn't care a thing about that, hey  
She thinks I'm beautiful. Meet Virginia  
  
She never compromises, loves babies and surprises  
Wears hi-heels when she exercises  
Ain't that beautiful  
Meet Virginia  
  
Well she wants to be the Queen  
Then she thinks about her scene  
Pulls her hair back as she screams  
I don't really wanna be the queen  
  
Her daddy wrestles alligators, Mama works on carburetors  
Her brother is a fine mediator for the President  
Well here she is again on the phone  
Just like me hates to be alone  
We just like to sit at home, and rip on the President  
  
Meet Virginia  
Well she wants to live her life  
Then she thinks about her life  
Pulls her hair back as she screams  
I don't really wanna live this life  
  
She only drinks coffee at midnight, when the moment is not  
Right, her timing is quite unusual  
You see her confidence is tragic, but her intuition magic  
And the shape of her body unusual  
  
Meet Virgina I can't wait to  
Meet Virginia, yeah e yeah hey hey hey  
  
Well she wants to be the queen and  
Then she thinks about her scene  
Well she wants to live her life  
Then she thinks about her life  
Pulls her hair back as she screams  
I don't really wanna be the queen  
I, I don't really wanna be the queen  
I, I don't really wanna be the queen  
I, I don't really wanna live this

Whoa, whoa  
Can't swim so I took a boat, to an island so remote  
Only Johnny Depp has ever been to it before  
Stayed there 'till the air was clear  
I was bored and out of tears, then I saw you washed up on the shore  
I offered you my coat, thank godess love can float  
Crazy how that shipwreck met my ship was comin' in  
We talked 'till the sun went down  
Love on the Pugit Sound  
My treasure map was on your skin  
  
Beauty in the water, angel on the beach  
Ocean's daughter, I thought love was out of reach  
'Till I got her, had I known it could come true  
I would have wished in ninety two, for a mermaid just like you  
Whoa, just like you, whoa  
  
Shocks, screams with envy they wonder what you see in me  
Funny thoughts sometimes can't help but wonder that as well  
Now life is a holiday, making up for the years I paid  
The way to this heavenly bay, it went through hell  
  
Beauty in the water, angel on the beach  
Ocean's daughter, I thought love was out of reach  
Till I got her, had I known it could come true  
I would have wished in ninety two, for a mermaid just like you  
Whoa, just like you, whoa  
  
Rescued you by the Banu tree, all the girl fish in the sea  
Puttin' a candle to you, they don't have a handle on you, they don't have a
scandal on you  
Holler back will save you  
Saving me was B-I-G, all the boy fish in the sea  
They all wish that they could be me  
  
Can't swim so I took a boat, to an island so remote  
Only Johnny Depp has ever been to it before  
  
Beauty in the water, angel on the beach  
Ocean's daughter, I thought love was out of reach  
'Till I got her, had I known it could come true  
I would have wished in ninety two, for a mermaid just like you  
Whoa, just like you, whoa  
  
Whoa, just like you, whoa(Rescued you by the Banu tree, all the girl fish in
the sea)  
Just like you, whoa

They call her Mississippi  
But she don't flow to me  
Spends her light on the Bayou  
But she don't come to see  
She's the one that makes my dreams  
They call her Mississippi  
But she don't flow to me  
  
The shape of her horizon  
Makes the morning sun  
When she puts her eyes on  
Each and anyone  
She's the one that makes me fall  
Midnight moon shines through it all  
  
She's the one that makes me fall  
Midnight moon shines through it all  
She's the one that makes my dreams  
They call her Mississippi  
But she don't flow to me  
They call her Mississippi  
But she don't flow to me

[Chorus: x2]  
I ain't no new sensation, no, no  
But I'm better than I ever been  
  
Take a look at my situation  
Tearing it down just to start it up  
I ain't no new sensation  
But I'm better than I ever been  
Used to spend time trying to chase it  
Now I spend time trying to erase it  
I ain't no new temptation  
But I'm better than I ever been  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now take a look at this reputation  
It's not what it is but what it's not  
It ain't some new sensation  
But it keeps getting better and better and  
Used to spend time thinking there's a reason  
Now I spend time knowing I'm in season  
I ain't no new temptation  
But I'm better than I ever been  
  
And I've been running away from you for way too long  
And all my trying, all your lying, all of your crying,  
I kept buying it  
I've waited too long  
  
[Chorus: x2]

Whose eyes in my behind  
I don't recognize anything that I see  
Whose skin is this design  
I don't want this to be the way that you see me  
  
I don't understand anything anymore  
And this web that I'm tied up  
Is taking me right up these walls  
That I climb up to get to your story  
It's anything but ordinary  
  
And when the world is on its knees  
With me, its fine  
And when I come to the rescue,  
I get nothing but left behind  
Everybody seems to be getting what they need  
Where's mine?  
'Cause you're what I need  
So very but I'm anything but ordinary  
  
Can you save me from this world of mine  
Before I get myself arrested with these expectations  
You are the one, look what you've done  
What have you done  
This is not some kind of joke  
You're just a kid  
You weren't ready for what you did, no  
  
And when the world is on its knees  
With me, its fine  
And when I come to the rescue,  
I do it for you time after time  
Everybody seems to be getting what they need  
Where's mine?  
'Cause you're what I need  
So very but I'm anything but ordinary  
  
I think I'm trying to save the world for you  
You've been saving me too  
We could just stay and save each other  
  
I'm anything but ordinary  
I'm anything but ordinary

  
It's hard to be tied to you  
When your rock keeps is falling down  
Dudududuuu nananana  
It's hard to be tied to you  
When this rock keep falling down  
Dudududuuu nananana  
Out here in the open  
Underneath the sun  
Out here where I'm hoping  
Someday you'll be the one  
Out here on the open  
I get to keep what's mine  
It's hard to live up to you  
When you're never doing anything wrong  
Dudududuuu nananana  
It's hard to live up to what you think of yourself  
You know you've got to be putting me on  
Dudududuuu nananana  
Out here in the open  
Underneath the sky  
Out here where I'm hoping  
I wanna get my wings and fly  
Out here on the open  
I get to speak my miiiiind  
Got to get yourself up right  
So what you finally tell you that you're too uptight  
Hey hey  
That's what I say  
You've been working at the carwash way too long  
You know that life is just about another funky song  
Hey hey hey hey, that's what you say  
Out here in the open  
Underneath my name  
Somebody's gonna pay attention to me  
Someday everybody's gonna pay attention to me  
And out here in the open, I get the chance to shine  
Out here in the open, yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah  
Somebody's gonna pay attention to me  
Someday everybody's gonna pay attention to me  
Out here in the open  
I get the chance to shine  
I get the chance to shiiiiiine  
  
  

I wanna take you with me  
To life with no more yesterdays  
We can start again awake and so excited  
And change the way we always push  
The way we pull  
  
I open up and be your parachute baby  
And I'll never let you down  
So open up and be my human angel  
And we'll only hit the ground  
Running  
  
And when the world gets sharp and tries to cut you down to size  
And makes you feel like giving in  
Oh, I will stay, I will rain, I will wash the words and pain away  
And I will chase away the way we push  
The way we pull  
You're beautiful  
  
I'll open up and be your parachute  
  
And I'll never let you down  
So open up and be my human angel  
And we'll only hit the ground  
Running  
  
And if it feels like we might drop  
It will stop  
So don't look down  
It wouldn't be the same without you  
This life is too good to give up on  
  
I'll open up and be your parachute  
And I'll never let you down  
So open up and be my human angel  
And we'll only hit the ground  
And we're gonna hit the ground  
Running

[Chorus]  
Play that song  
The one that makes me go all night long  
The one that makes me think of you  
That's all you gotta do  
  
[Verse 1]  
Hey mister DJ when you gonna spin it  
My baby's favorite record  
She been waiting for a minute  
She invited all her friends  
And I'm buying all the rounds  
And they're all dolled up

When you gonna play that song, now  
When you gonna earn that pay  
When you gonna play that song  
And make my day

[Verse 2]  
Hey Mr. guitar

And you should play it cause she loves it  
Can you get me off the hook  
Get them fingers picking now

Not too smart, just out of school  
A teachers pet and modern fool  
Talked about being a freelance broker  
But the police caught him tryin' to choke her  
Can't describe him in his corner  
Like a rat out of the water  
Out of work and outta grass  
Mother Mary, never seems to stop to talk, she just walk on past  
Down Down, no information one day always away  
But why why, can't I see you  
One day always away  
Why why can't I be you  
One day always away  
He's outta school now, just another taken bar stool  
And this neighborhood ain't what he had in mind  
Wants to be your girlfriend, love to be your boyfriend  
Wants to be your telephone, wants to wants to be your man  
But why why, can't I see you  
One day always away  
Why why can't I be you  
One day always away  
Down Down, no information

For reasons I don't know I treated you so cold  
I wish I had those times again  
'Cause something that you said keeps ringing in my head  
Someday you're gonna wanna come back and you're gonna wanna treat me fine  
  
Everybody needs a little respect  
Everybody needs a little time  
Everybody needs a little respect  
Everybody needs a little  
  
I watched me push you down in dreams I had of you  
And all I remember about those days is I would run around thinking that you'd  
Be alright  
But you lost your light along the way  
And oh you were right about the things I'd say  
'Cause if I had it back again I know I'd treat you kind  
  
Everybody needs a little respect  
Everybody needs a little time  
Everybody needs a little respect  
Everybody needs a little time  
Everybody got to have somebody  
Everybody got to have someone  
  
And all I ever wanted from this play  
Was someone to talk to when I get down  
It seems you get the things you give along the way  
Now all I need is one more chance to make you feel like hanging round  
  
Everybody needs a little  
Everybody needs a little  
Everybody needs a little respect  
Everybody needs a little time  
Everybody needs a little respect  
Everybody needs a little time  
Everybody  
Everybody got to have someone

I used to love the tenderloin  
Until I made some tender coin  
And then I met some ladies from Marin  
We took the highway to the one,  
Up the coast to catch some sun  
That left me with these blisters on my skin  
Don't know what I was on,  
But I think it grows in Oregon,  
So I kept on goin' going on right through  
I drove into Seattle rain  
Fell in love then missed the train  
That could have took me right back home to you  
  
[Chorus]  
I've been high, I've been low,  
I've been yes, and I've been oh, hell no!  
I've been rock 'n roll and disco,  
Won't you save me San Francisco?  
  
(Oh, oh, oh)  
Oh, oh  
(Oh, oh, oh oh oh oh)  
  
Every day so caffeinated  
I wish they were golden gated  
Fillmore couldn't feel more miles away  
So wrap me up return to sender  
Let's forget this five day bender  
Take me to my city by the bay!  
  
I never knew all that I had,  
Now Alcatraz don't sound so bad  
At least they have a hella fine merlot  
If I could wish upon a star  
I would hitch a cable car  
To the place that I can always call my own  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I've been up, I've been down,  
I've been so damn lost since you're not around,  
I been reggae and calypso  
Won't you save me San Francisco?  
  
To tell you the truth  
I miss everything, everything  
It's a wild, wild beautiful world  
But there's a wide eyed girl back there  
And she means everything, everything,  
  
I've been stop, I've been go  
I've been yes and I've been oh, hell no!  
I've been rock and roll and disco,  
Won't you save me San Francisco?  
  
I've been up, I've been down,  
I've been so damn lost  
Since you're not around,  
I've been reggae and calypso,  
Won't you save me San Francisco?  
  
(Oh, oh, oh)  
Oh, oh  
(Oh, oh, oh)  
(Save me San Francisco)  
  
(Oh, oh, oh)  
Oh, oh  
Won't you save me San Francisco  
  
(Oh, oh, oh)  
Oh, oh  
(Oh, oh, oh)  
(Save me San Francisco)  
  
(Oh, oh, oh)  
Oh, oh  
Won't you save me San Francisco

Ten pounds too much to the naked eye  
I don't take the bus because she drives  
Watermelon lipstick, and way too much  
She got buttermilk smile and a thorny touch  
Street smart, like a Courtney Love  
Can't get enough Hollywood stories of  
Anybody famous that can make her feel  
Like they're all kinda friends in a way  
No best friend, well one but she's crazy  
Grew up to end up a Professor of lazy  
The last of six kids that all left town  
Seems nobody ever wanted them around  
But she's cool like a soda can sittin' on ice  
Always orders sushi, only eats the rice  
Talks about J Lo like they're best of friends  
I think she loves me, but it all depends  
  
Hey baby, I don't want to be your Superman  
I just want to be your man and I'll be super, baby  
You'll be standin' in the sun shine  
I'll be standin' right here in the rain  
You save me and I will save the day  
  
I got a sweet gig rakin' in the cash with karaoke  
I get the crowd goin' when I sing the hokey pokey  
I shake it to the  
left and then I shake it to the right  
What's not to love, man I'm on tonight  
I got the LA stylie with the New York trim  
Keep my pants so low  
It's like I'm goin' for a swim  
I got the Coppertone tan, like in Mexico  
Well, not now but when I go, yea  
  
I know you don't see me like a movie star  
And it can't help much that I don't have no car  
But you're my favorite thing, by far  
That's gotta count for something

Well, I remember when every other day was bad  
You were my brother, so tall, was all you had  
Cerano was dead, but we had you instead  
Now I remember our precious petting zoo  
  
Our delicate high school  
And all the things we said we'd do, they all fall like  
Sweet Rain, wet my memory  
Sweet Rain, come on down on me  
It wasn't hard to look ahead  
You wanted to be me instead  
I wanted to be you instead  
But I fell and you fell back  
  
What is wrong with me?  
Well, what is wrong with you, Jack?  
Everybody knew she was coming  
Everybody knew that she was just too much for you  
Sweet Rain, wet my memory  
Sweet Rain, come on down on me  
The big screen got in between  
What it was and what we've seen  
  
How have you been?  
What have you been?  
I think about you now and again  
I think about you every single day  
Shit, I'm thinking about you right now  
And I know everybody here wants you  
I know everybody here thinks they need  
I've been waiting here just to touch you  
Ooh ooh yeah yeah  
Sweet Rain

I thought I knew it all  
I've been through the highs, said all my goodbyes  
Learned to run before I learned to crawl  
It's not worth fighting for if one of us is sure  
And one of us is dying, trying to find love's cure  
  
I have waited all my life to paint these cities red  
Thoughts I've always had here are stuck inside my head  
It's not worth waiting for if one of us wants more  
And one of us is dying, trying to find love's door  
  
When we learn how to fly  
We forget how to walk  
When we learn how to sing  
We don't wanna hear each other talk  
  
Here we are at the finish line, ah  
Here we are at the finish line  
  
And you, you really thought you knew  
Everything to do  
With holding onto me  
And holding on, this time  
Is making me slip right  
Through your hands  
And now you don't understand  
Trying to find love all yourself  
  
When we learn how to fly,  
We forget how to walk  
When we learn how to sing  
Don't wanna hear each other talk  
When we know what we want  
We forget what we need  
When you find who you are  
You forget about me  
  
Here we are at the finish line, ah  
Here we are at the finish line, ah  
Here we are at the finish line, ah, ah, ah  
Ah, ah, ah  
Ah, ah, ah

You and I were friends from outer space  
Afraid to let go  
The only two who understood this place  
And as far as we know  
We were way before our time  
As bold as we were blind  
Just another perfect mistake  
Another bridge to take  
On the way of letting go,  
  
This ain't goodbye  
It is just the way love goes  
But when the words aren't warm enough,  
To keep away the cold, oh no  
This ain't good bye  
It's not where our story ends  
But I know you can't be mine,  
Not the way you always been  
As long as we've got time  
Then this ain't goodbye  
Oh no, this ain't goodbye  
  
We were stars up in the sunlit sky  
No one else could see  
Neither of else ever thought to ever ask why  
It wasn't meant to be  
Maybe we were way too high  
To ever understand  
Baby we were victims of all, all the foolish plans  
We began to divide  
  
But this ain't goodbye  
This is just the way love goes  
But where's the woman now to keep way the cold, oh no  
This ain't goodbye  
It's not where our story ends  
But I know you cant be mine  
Just like the way you've always been  
As long as we got time,  
This ain't good bye,  
Oh no, this ain't good bye,  
Oh oh, oh no this ain't goodbye  
No na na, na na na  
Na na na na na na na  
Na na na this ain't goodbye  
  
You and I were friends from outer space  
Afraid to let go  
The only two who understood this place  
And as far as we know  
This ain't goodbye  
Oh no this ain't goodbye  
This ain't goodbye  
Oh no this ain't goodbye  
This ain't goodbye  
It's just the way love goes  
But when the words aren't warm enought, to keep away the cold, oh no,  
This ain't goodbye  
This isn't where the story ends  
But I know you can't be mine  
Like the way you've always been  
Oh no, don't say it  
No na na, na na na  
Na na na na na na na  
Na na na don't say good bye

I don't understand you,  
The way you disappear,  
You don't understand me,  
The way I keep us here.  
  
This is not your life,  
I know how to do it on my own,  
This is not your life.  
  
We were only children,  
But you knew the game,  
And you were busy feeling,  
That someone had to take the blame.  
  
But I know how you're really,  
When no one's around,  
We were only children,  
Looking to be found.  
  
This is not your life,  
I know how to do it on my own.  
This is not your life,  
I know how to do it on my own.  
This is not your life...  
  
Even after the fall,  
No one ever seemed to care,  
And now you come back to call,  
And you want me to be here.  
  
I know how to do it on my own,  
This is not your life,  
I know how to do it on my own,  
This is not your life,  
And I know how to do it on my own,  
And this is not your life,  
I know how to do it on my own,  
And this is not your life,  

You have my heart  
And we'll never be worlds apart  
May be in magazines  
But you'll still be my star  
Baby cause in the dark  
You can't see shiny cars  
And that's when you need me there  
With you I'll always share  
Because  
  
When the sun shines, we'll shine together  
Told you I'll be here forever  
Said I'll always be a friend  
Took an oath I'ma stick it out till the end  
Now that it's raining more than ever  
Know that we'll still have each other  
You can stand under my umbrella  
You can stand under my umbrella  
(Ella ella eh eh eh)  
Under my umbrella  
(Ella ella eh eh eh)  
Under my umbrella  
(Ella ella eh eh eh)  
Under my umbrella  
(Ella ella eh eh eh)  
Under my umbrella  
(Ella ella eh eh eh eh eh eh)  
  
These fancy things, will never come in between  
You're part of my entity, here for Infinity  
When the war has took it's part  
When the world has dealt it's cards  
If the hand is hard, together we'll mend your heart  
Because  
  
When the sun shines, we'll shine together  
Told you I'll be here forever  
Said I'll always be a friend  
Took an oath I'ma stick it out till the end  
Now that it's raining more than ever  
Know that we'll still have each other  
  
You can stand under my umbrella  
You can stand under my umbrella  
(Ella ella eh eh eh)  
Under my umbrella  
(Ella ella eh eh eh)  
Under my umbrella  
(Ella ella eh eh eh)  
Under my umbrella  
(Ella ella eh eh eh)  
Under my umbrella  
(Ella ella eh eh eh eh eh eh)  
  
You can run into my arms  
It's OK don't be alarmed  
Come here to me  
There's no distance in between our love  
So go on and let the rain pour  
I'll be all you need and more  
Because  
  
When the sun shines, we'll shine together  
Told you I'll be here forever  
Said I'll always be a friend  
Took an oath I'ma stick it out till the end  
Now that it's raining more than ever  
Know that we'll still have each other  
You can stand under my umbrella  
You can stand under my umbrella  
(Ella ella eh eh eh)  
Under my umbrella  
(Ella ella eh eh eh)  
Under my umbrella  
(Ella ella eh eh eh)  
Under my umbrella  
(Ella ella eh eh eh)  
Under my umbrella  
(Ella ella eh eh eh eh eh eh)  
  
It's raining  
Ooh baby it's raining  
come here to me  
Come here to me  
Come here to me  
  
It's pour rain  
It's pour rain  
Come here to me  
Come here to me  
Come here to me

Since then I never feel helpless, recess, this mess if you do  
And I find that even time well spent gets bent if you need it to  
And we do  
Well by now I've showed you how much I believe in the here and now and I wish  
That you knew  
  
Lay all you want on me  
Lay all you want on me  
Lay all you want on me  
I'll be your whipping boy  
  
You spilled your purse onto my bed  
Searching for something for your head  
Since then you never come clean I mean  
You wish you only could  
  
Lay all you want on me  
Lay all you want on me  
Lay all you want on me  
I'll be your whipping boy  
  
I can get up  
  
And I find that even time well spent gets bent if you need it to  
And we do  
And we do  
Lay all you want on me  
Lay all you want on me  
Lay all you want on me  
I'll be your whipping boy

I'd give anything but I won't give up on you  
I'd say anything, but not goodbye  
I will run with your changes and I'm always on your side  
And there's not a word I've ever heard, that would make me change my mind  
  
Words they'll try to shake you  
Don't let them break you  
Or stop your world from turning  
When words keep you from feeling good  
Use them as fire wood and let 'em burn  
  
Like stones in your pocket people try to wear you down  
Someone always wants to take the love you've found  
So let's roll with these changes and I want you by my side  
And there's not a word I've ever heard that could make me change my mind  
  
Words they'll try to shake you  
Don't let them break you  
Or stop your world from turning  
When words keep you from feeling good  
Use them as fire wood and let 'em burn  
  
Let them burn  
Let them burn  
Underneath every word somebody's heart been broken  
With or without words, we try to forget  
  
Words they'll try to shake us  
Don't let them break us  
Or stop our world from turning  
When words keep you from feeling good  
Use them as fire wood and let 'em burn  
  
Words they'll try to shake you  
Don't let them break you  
Or stop your world, stop your world from turning 'round  
When words keep you from feeling good  
Use them as fire wood and let 'em burn  
  
Let them burn  
Let them burn

This bipolar love affair  
It just ain't where it's at for me anymore  
So don't let the door hit you when you leave  
  
You throw me in the fire just to save my life  
A pretty little liar when I call you out  
You'd rather put up a fight  
Than just come clean  
  
Get on your way to making someone else feel loved  
And higher than they ever thought they could go  
You already know  
I'm giving you up and letting me down  
Stop pretending that you're gonna turn yourself around  
You already know  
Know know know  
You already know  
Know know know  
Don't ask me why  
You already know  
  
I was a shoulder you leaned on  
You made me feel like the next James Bond  
Double Oh-seven, oh hell, you were heaven to me  
but while you were singin' what I wanted to hear  
You started breaking ground on a new frontier  
Always makin' love, but never with me  
  
So get on your way to makin' someone else feel loathin'  
And higher than they ever thought they could go  
You already know  
Giving you up and letting me down  
Stop pretending that you're gonna turn yourself around  
You already know  
Know know know  
You already know  
Know know know  
Don't ask me why  
You already know  
  
You already know that, I'm done waiting  
Going crazy hating myself for loving you  
At least the one side of you I thought I knew  
You already know  
  
You already know  
You already know  
Know know know  
You already know  
Know know know  
Don't ask me why

Don't cry when I die  
When it's my time I probably won't die  
I'll just lie down and close my eyes  
And think about stuff  
These eyes got too wide seen too much of life's goodbyes  
Should have spent less time making loot  
And spent more time in my birthday suit with you  
  
And everybody upstairs, everybody down stairs  
I'm not gonna have time to hang out with them  
  
'cause I'll be hanging out with you  
  
Not Jimi Hendrix, Jesus or the dude  
Who played the sherriff in Blazing Saddles  
You not Chris Farley Mr. Rodgers oh I've waited so long  
You can finally meet my Mom  
  
Life is good, but love it's better  
Even Bieber ain't forever  
We all got to go you know  
So you might as well go in style  
Everybody prayin', everybody singing  
I'm not gonna have time to hang out with them  
  
'Cause I'll be hanging out with you  
  
Not Gilda Radner, Buddha or the dude  
Who had pop rocks and soda at the same time  
You, not Jesse James, Paul Newman and oh I've waited so long  
You can finally meet my Mom  
  
I'm not making light of things  
But who's to say who's right with things like this  
There's so much that we miss  
Tryin' so hard to be rich and famous  
Pretty and thin, to win  
It's a shame that youth is wasted on the young  
  
So forget everything and just be with me here now  
For as long as we can and whoever goes first save a spot  
  
You, not Etta James, Bob Marley or the girls who won my heart along the way  
You, not Sitting Bull, Ella or Bach and I almost forgot  
You can finally meet my Mom  
(You can finally meet my Mom)  
You can finally meet my Mom  
(You can finally meet my Mom)  
(You can finally meet my Mom)  
  
No Steve Jobs, or Ty Cobbs, Al Capone or any other mobs  
No Whitney Houston,no Chet Baker, Andre the Giant or the Undertaker, just you  
You can finally meet my Mom  
You can finally meet my Mom  
You can finally meet my Mom  
You can finally meet my Mom

I can see the red, white and free in you  
You light the night up like the moon  
And underneath your clouds, I see the blue  
  
You're hopeless 'cause you tell the truth  
The stars are jealous of your shine  
If you were mine  
There's not a thing I wouldn't do  
  
You're black and beautiful, yellow, tan  
You're white as light and soft as sand  
With greens and greys and oh for days  
A silver lining on the way you cover everyone  
Just like a morning sun  
You turn me into someone I would rather be  
  
Oh I love your every color  
Oh I love your everything  
You wear the day around you  
Like it's yours to stay around you  
Maybe I could stay around you too  
If that's alright with you  
  
You're coffee brown and bubble gum pink  
And oh I think the shade of you is on the brink  
Of changing all the ways I see the world  
I could drown inside a single drop  
Of all the kinds of things you got  
And all the kinds of things I'm not  
  
Might just give me a chance to see  
From way up where you are  
Above the silent stars  
Just dancing in the sky  
  
You're better than any rainbow  
You're brighter than the sun  
You look like my first day of summer  
When my spring is on the run  
You're gold and more gold  
And you're platinum too  
With snow toned, copper attitude  
I don't know what I'd do without you  
I don't know what I'll do about you
