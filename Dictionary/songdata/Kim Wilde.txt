Suddenly there's a shadow on a nation  
Suddenly it's a changing situation  
Fear is on the face of every tiger as the jungle grows  
Suddenly people running never walking  
Nobody wants to know, nobody's talking  
But rushing through the air  
I feel the wind of change about to blow  
  
Chorus:  
Watch out tonight, the dogs are down in action city  
There out tonight, there's trouble down in action city  
  
Watching the police running from the station  
Suddenly flashing lights and confrotation  
The devil walks the streets  
Just as the flames of hell begin to grow  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's a brave new world, It's a brave new world  
Such a brave new world  
Well I don't know where it's going  
But it's heading for some changes I know  
  
People are wondering why there's such confusion  
There is a face of youth with disillusion  
Don't look for the reasons  
They were sprayed on every wall I know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's a brave new world, It's a brave new world  
Such a brave new world  
Well I don't know where it's going  
But it's heading for some changes I know

Never, ever felt this way before  
You are that one that I'm craving for  
Another step nearer your heart  
Another step closer to knowing you  
Another step nearer your heart, I'm on my way  
I never thought it could happen  
Being close to someone like you  
But you know this isn't just a minute affair  
If we make time and take a lot of care  
As I love everything about it  
There's such a good feel about it  
And I know where I'm gonna be  
If you take a step closer to me  
Another step nearer your heart  
Another step closer to knowing you  
Another step nearer your heart, I'm on my way  
I couldn't even describe it  
Though I tried I couldn't find the words  
When you're stumbling through life  
And love is one step away  
And you carry on or do you stay  
We've got to promise faithfully  
To hang on to each other and never leave  
That's the way love's gonna be  
If you take a step closer to me, come on now  
Another step nearer your heart  
Another step closer to knowing you  
Another step nearer your heart, I'm on my way  
The only way to deal with affairs of the heart  
You've got to jump right in, doesn't matter who starts  
Take a step nearer, come over here  
Together we can make it tonight  
Oh, we can make it tonight  
Another step, another step  
Another step nearer your heart  
Another step closer to knowing you  
Another step nearer your heart, I'm on my way  
Another step nearer your heart  
Another step closer to knowing you  
Another step nearer your heart, I'm on my way  
I'm on my way, I'm on my way  

Take me now, baby, here as I am  
Put me close, try and understand  
Desire is hunger is the fire I breathe  
Love is a banquet on which we feed  
  
Come on now, try and understand  
The way I feel when I'm in your hands  
Take my hand, come under cover  
They can't hurt you now,  
Can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now  
  
Because the night belongs to lovers  
Because the night belongs to lust  
Because the night belongs to lovers  
Because the night belongs to us  
  
Have I doubt, baby, when I'm alone  
Love is a ring, a telephone  
Love is an angel, disguised as lust  
Here in our bed 'til the morning comes  
  
Come on now try and understand  
The way I feel under your command  
Take my hand as the sun descends  
They can't hurt you now,  
Can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now  
  
Because the night belongs to lovers  
Because the night belongs to lust  
Because the night belongs to lovers  
Because the night belongs to us  
  
With love we sleep  
With doubt the vicious circle  
Turns and burns  
Without you I cannot breathe  
Forgive, the yearning burning  
I believe it's time to heal to feel  
So touch me now, touch me now, touch me now  
  
Because the night belongs to lovers  
Because the night belongs to lust  
Because the night belongs to lovers  
Because the night belongs to us  
  
Have I doubt when I am alone  
Love is a ring on the telephone

(Be wild)  
Get your motor runnin'  
Head out on the highway  
Lookin' for adventure  
And whatever comes our way  
Yeah darlin' go make it happen  
Take the world in a love embrace  
Fire all of your guns at once  
And explode into space  
I like smoke and lightning  
Heavy metal thunder  
Racin' with the wind  
And the feelin' that I'm under  
Yeah Darlin' go make it happen  
Take the world in a love embrace  
Fire all of your guns at once  
And explode into space  
Like a true nature's child  
We were born, born to be wild  
We can climb so high  
I never wanna die  
Born to be wild  
Born to be wild

Fresh out of school the young girl lose the sound  
She's gonna go where the young bands hang around  
And it's still to right with a voice inside  
She's screaming, dreaming  
And there's no disguise when you look in her eyes she's scheming  
  
I'm thinking about the boys  
She's thinking about the boys  
Thinking about the boys  
  
There in the dark he starts to touch her hair  
Others go round but right now you don't care  
Well you just don't fight when they're holding you tight  
That feeling, feeling  
Well it looks to good and he's making it so appealing  
  
I'm thinking about the boys  
Thinking about the boys  
Thinking about the boys  
  
Still feeling ground as she goes to make the kill  
Watching her move the world is standing still  
'cause its still too right with a voice inside  
You screaming, dreaming  
And there's no disguise when you look in their eyes she's scheming  
  
I'm thinking about the boys  
Thinking about the boys  
Thinking about the boys

Child come away  
It's the girl with the deputy walking by  
Child go and play  
No I won't give you reasons so don't ask why  
  
I read the story about a week ago  
They found her on the beach that night  
They thought the light had gone out of her eyes  
and no-one thinks she'll ever be right  
She was so full of her life  
Happy with the people she knew  
But then no-one can tell  
  
Child come away  
It's the girl with the deputy walking by  
Child go and play  
No I won't give you reasons so don't ask why  
  
Guess all they found were some marks in the sand  
A message saying 'She is mine'  
Nobody touched her as she got in the car  
Well nobody dares to anytime  
She was so full of her life  
The girl that everybody once knew  
But now no-one can tell  
  
Child come away  
It's the girl with the deputy walking by  
Child go and play  
No I won't give you reasons so don't ask why  
  
And when they read a story out to the judge  
I heard they had to turn away  
It's all over town  
  
I saw her face in the back of a car  
As they were speeding out of town  
She's got a mark on the side of her face  
that no-one's ever seen around  
And what she is or what she's become  
I guess the town will never know  
  
Child come away  
It's the girl with the deputy walking by  
Child go and play  
No I won't give you reasons so don't ask why

We were dancing  
Dancing in the dark  
Sweet romancing  
Something's gonna start  
  
He stepped into the night  
With his heart open wide  
I was standing there  
With nowhere left to hide  
He looked to me like a shadow  
Moving in the night  
Then he took a hold of my hand  
In the soft moonlight  
  
And we were dancing  
Dancing in the dark  
Sweet romancing  
Something's gonna start  
  
I could hear his heartbeat  
Pounding in the night  
I could feel his body  
Starting to be kind  
With his soft red lips  
Made up my mind  
His soothing kiss  
Was all I desired  
  
And we were dancing  
Dancing in the dark  
Sweet romancing  
Something's gonna start  
  
We kissed and touched  
But it wasn't enough  
To stop this wheel of fire  
One step at a time  
And I knew he was mine  
We were lost in the heat of desire  
  
And we were dancing  
Dancing in the dark  
Sweet romancing  
Something's gonna start  
  
No way  
No way at all  
To stop us moving closer  
Each look in his eyes  
Made my heart beat in time  
Over and over and over and over  
  
And we were dancing  
Dancing in the dark  
Sweet romancing  
Something's gonna start  
  
And we were dancing  
Dancing in the dark  
Sweet romancing  
Something's gonna start

Written by kim wilde  
Don't say nothing's changed with you  
I can hear it in your sighs  
The way that you can't look me in the eyes  
It's spelling out bad news  
So don't say it's the same we two  
No I can't say I'm surprised  
'cause I could see it in your eyes  
And no you don't have to lie  
Baby you don't have to lie  
Why can't it be like yesterday  
The feelings gone  
But I just want to say that I love you know  
And I'm holding on for you  
Is that a silly thing to do  
So don't say nothing's changed with you  
Now we're running out of time  
And I've got to give up something that was mine  
Oh baby doesn't it seem cruel  
So don't say it's the same we two  
'cause we're already worlds apart  
And now the lonliness will start  
Oh boy you're breaking my heart  
Baby you're breaking my heart  
So don't say nothing's changed with you  

Shadows across the floor  
Memories fading in  
Voices are far away  
Now it can all begin  
  
"New York are on the 'phone  
They want you here today"  
"Was it a fashion show ?"  
"Sorry they wouldn't say"  
  
There's a world full of dreams  
Lying on a pillow  
There's a world no-one knows  
Wrapped up in her mind  
(It's all imagination)  
  
Now she is back in school  
(It's the revolution)  
Staring at broken glass  
(Do what we want you to)  
Flicking the flies away  
(Total autonomy)  
Watching the trains go past  
  
Fighting the Indian war  
Cochise is closing in  
Now she can touch his face !  
Riding so close to him  
  
There's a world full of dreams  
Lying on a pillow  
There's a world no-one's seen  
Living in her mind  
  
Sailing across a sea  
Images on a screen  
Watching the boats go by  
Red merging into green  
  
Roxanne don't run away  
(You've been naughty girl)  
I told you not to go  
(Stay in the garden)  
Why do you run away ?  
Mommy will sorry so

All the time I try to reason with you  
But I just can't seem to make you understand  
Nothing seems to ever really get through  
Can't you feel emotions like any other man  
  
You never cared for anyone (anyone)  
You never cared for anyone (at all)  
Any love that you've ever given me  
You only gave me for your ego  
  
Look at how you wanted all of my tears  
Any time you felt you needed security  
All the nights you let me out on my own  
That's the thing that you just can't give back to me  
  
You never cared for anyone (anyone)  
You never cared for anyone (at all)  
Any love that you've ever given me  
You only gave me for your ego  
  
You're only plan it seems is look after number one  
You just can't comprehend what it means to love someone  
  
Stay away, get lost, get out of my life  
Can't you see the changes now and at last I'm free  
Any plans I have just don't include you  
And that's the one thing you won't take from me  
  
You never cared for anyone (anyone)  
You never cared for anyone (at all)  
Any love that you've ever given me  
You only gave me for your ego  
  
Every time I tried to reason with you  
But it seemed that I never made you understand  
Nothing ever seemed to ever really get through  
Can't you feel emotions like any other man  
  
You never cared for anyone (anyone)  
You never cared for anyone (at all)  
Any love that you've ever given me  
You only gave me for your ego

I tell ya  
It's hell yeah  
When love says goodbye it's a four letter word  
Because your heart knows  
When love goes  
The feeling is bad - it's the pits of the world  
It's sad but true  
When nothing you can do, can bring it back  
  
Standing in the rain  
She starts to cry  
Is it all a game  
She wonders why  
Why it had to start  
Why should it end, and take her apart  
  
Because she shows it  
She knows it  
But what can she do, it's a four letter word  
Because it shakes you  
It breaks you  
And when it's the end, it's the worst thing you heard  
It's over now  
And nothing you can do can bring it back  
  
Calling out his name  
She starts to cry  
Guys are all the same  
She wants to die  
Hide away the tears  
No-one will see, and no-one must hear  
But oh  
  
How can the love that she has be profain  
And how can something that's so beautiful  
Just Jeckyl and Hyde around  
It's so sad...  
  
I tell ya  
It's hell yeah  
When love says goodbye  
It's a four letter word  
Because your heart knows  
When love goes  
The feeling is bad  
it's the worst in the world  
It's sad but true  
When nothing you can do, can get it back  
  
Standing in the rain  
She starts to cry  
Shouting out is name  
Four letter words

Have yourself a merry little Christmas  
Let your heart be light  
From now on our troubles will be out of sight  
  
Have yourself a merry little Christmas  
Make the Yuletide gay  
From now on our troubles will be miles away  
  
Here we are as in olden days  
Happy golden days of Yore  
Faithful friends who are dear to us  
gather near to us once more  
  
Through the years we all will be together  
If the fates allow  
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough  
and have yourself a merry little Christmas now  
  
Through the years we all will be together  
If the fates allow  
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough  
and have yourself a merry little Christmas now

In the day I can smile though I want to die  
I hold on, hold on  
I can keep it together for a little while  
And be strong, so strong  
But when the sun goes down and I'm all alone  
I haven't the strength to fight  
That's when my tears give into the night  
Tell me how, How much loneliness can one heart take  
Without the chance that it will break in two  
And why I'm holding on to a love that has gone  
Tell me how to carry on  
  
I believed that meeting you would be my destiny  
Your love would come to set me free  
So why am I left standing here alone  
Won't you please come and take me home  
  
Tears give into the night  
In the day I can smile though I want to die  
Tears give into the night  
I can keep it together for a little while  
In the day I can smile though I want to die  
Tears give into the night

I can't help it when you're near me  
I don't think straight, I get all confused  
I just lose all my concentration  
With no question at all I'd surrender to you  
Standing here so close together  
I can feel all the magic again  
But I'm holding back the emotion  
Couldn't take anymore of the heartache and pain  
I know I should take it slow but,  
The minute I see you I just let go  
Chorus :  
'cause you, baby, you hypnotise  
I just have to look in your eyes  
I'm in a daze, I lose control  
Deeper inside my mind  
I'm leaving the real world behind  
I give to you my heart and my soul  
It's a gamble, can we take it  
Playing safe is no way to survive  
There's a chance for us, we can make it  
Give our love room to breathe to keep it alive  
Admit that we made mistakes but  
I know in my heart that it's not too late  
Chorus :  
'cause you, baby, you hypnotise  
I just have to look in your eyes  
I'm in a daze, I lose control  
Deeper inside my mind  
I'm leaving the real world behind  
I give to you my heart and my soul  
It feels like I'm falling in love with you all over again  
And I'm trying not to let it show  
But the minute I see you I just let go  
I just have to look in your eyes  
I'm in a daze, I lose control  
  

As performed in the musical "tommy"  
With alistair robins as mr. walker  
Written by pete townsend  
  
Alistair: this can't continue  
It makes no sense  
We're getting nowhere  
I've lost all my confidence  
The boy wants something  
Unsatisfied  
He needs attention  
And care our love can't provide  
  
And then, there's the matter of us  
  
I'd like to prove  
That I don't think you've seen the best of me  
I've stood up for the boy  
And I've clung to the hopes and the lies  
  
I wished that the pain in your gaze  
Could again be a test of me  
But when I look in the mirror  
I believe my own eyes  
  
I believe my own eyes  
Now I've come to the end  
All my patience is gone  
When I'm doubtful I tend  
To believe my own eyes  
  
Kim: I'd like to declare  
This devotion and care is a life to live  
That nothing has changed  
And the time isn't passing us by  
But I have to say here  
That for us there is a clear-cut alternative  
When we look at eachother  
We believe our own eyes  
  
Both: I believe my own eyes  
Now I've come to the end  
All my patience is gone  
When I'm doubtful I tend  
To believe my own eyes  
  
This has gone far enough  
After all we've been through  
We can be brave  
We done all we can humanly do  
It's a time to be tough  
A time to be wise  
We must stop chasing our dreams and recover our lives  
  
I believe my own eyes  
Now I've come to the end  
All my patience is gone  
When I'm doubtful I tend  
To believe...  
  
I'd like to believe  
But I don't think that we've seen the best of us  
And a way to believe is to see where the real future lies  
I hope that the pain in your gaze can again be a test of me  
And when I look in the mirror  
I believe my own eyes  
  
Let's believe our own eyes  
No we've come to the end  
All our patience is gone  
Let's admit we intend to believe our own eyes  
  
Kim: ... to believe our own eyes

Don't know why  
I'm surviving every lonely day  
When there's got to be  
No chance for me  
  
My life would end  
And it doesn't matter how I cry  
My tears of love  
Are a waste of time  
If I turn away  
  
Am I strong enough to see it through  
Go crazy is what I will do  
  
If I can't have you  
I don't want nobody baby  
If I can't have you, oh oh oh oh  
If I can't have you  
I don't want nobody baby  
If I can't have you, oh oh oh...  
  
Can't let go  
And it doesn't matter how I try  
I gave it all so easily  
To you my love  
  
To dreams that never will come true  
Am I strong enough to see it through  
Go crazy is what I will do  
  
If I can't have you  
I don't want nobody baby  
If I can't have you, oh oh oh oh  
If I can't have you  
I don't want nobody baby  
If I can't have you, oh oh oh...

Look for the strength you know you can feel  
Search for the truth you know that is real  
Then reach for the place you know they can't steal  
And say, I'm feeling good with my life  
  
No point in letting life bring you down  
There's always something bad hangin' round  
Face up to trouble and stare it out  
I know I'm feeling good with my life  
  
In my life - everything is feeling good  
In my life - feeling like you know it should  
In my life - can't you see it's understood  
I'm feeling good with my life  
  
No better place to start than with you  
Get your head together then follow through  
It's not what you're saying it's what you do  
I know I'm feeling good with my life  
  
Don't fantasize how your life could be  
Make all your dreams a reality  
Then there is nothing can bring you down  
I know I'm feeling good with my life  
  
In my life - everything is feeling good  
In my life - feeling like you know it should  
In my life - can't you see it's understood  
I'm feeling good with my life  
  
We've got to make it living together  
Learning to share our lives  
We've got to speak from the heart  
Find a new way to start  
That's something we've all got to realise  
In my life

Looking out a dirty old window.  
Down below the cars in the city go rushing by.  
I sit here alone and I wonder why.  
  
Friday night and everyone's moving.  
I can feel the heat but it's soothing.  
Heading down, I search for the beat in this dirty town.  
  
Down town the young ones are going.  
Down town the young ones are growing.  
We're the kids in America.  
Everybody live for the music-go-round.  
  
Bright lights the music get faster.  
Look boy, don't check on your watch, not another glance.  
I'm not leaving now, honey not a chance.  
  
Hot-shot, give me no problems.  
Much later baby you'll be saying never mind.  
You know life is cruel, life is never kind.  
  
Kind hearts don't make a new story.  
Kind hearts don't grab any glory.  
We're the kids in America.  
Everybody live for the music-go-round.  
  
Come closer, honey that's better.  
Got to get a brand new experience.  
Feeling right.  
Oh don't try to stop baby.  
Hold me tight.  
  
Outside a new day is dawning.  
Outside Suburbia's sprawling everywhere.  
I don't want to go baby.  
New York to East California.  
There's a new wave coming I warn you.  
  
We're the kids in America.  
Everybody live for the music-go-round.  
We're the kids in America.

Something's coming down the street  
Something static under your feet  
Never looking left or right  
'coz she'll just blow you out of sight  
  
She's never waiting on your smile  
Devastating, what's in her style ?  
Situation no-go zone  
But she'll cut loose when she's alone  
  
[Chorus:]  
She's a love Blonde  
She's a love Blonde  
She's a love Blonde  
She's got that sensuality for love  
  
When the boys say "how you been  
What you doin', Can we get in ?"  
Eyes'll flash and lips will smile  
And she'll just tease them for a while  
  
'coz now you see her, now you don't  
You could be there, only you won't  
If you've got that "Savoir Faire"  
Well that girl knows and she's aware  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oooh, well if she fills your dreams tonight  
Oooh, just lay back and hold on tight  
  
[Chorus]

Well it sounded like a whisper  
But soon became a cry  
And the moment that I touch you  
I know the reason why - we got love  
No union is stronger than a woman with a man  
I'm gonna give love in the natural way  
With everything I can  
Never mind if things go wrong  
You and I will still be strong  
And how I love you now  
  
Oh baby, we're here tonight  
We can make it last forever  
Wen can make it last for life  
Oh, baby, no matter what  
I'm gonna give love in the natural way  
With everything I got  
  
All times it can be gentle  
And at times it can be cruel  
It can treat you like a stranger  
It can treat you like a fool  
But tonight I wanna hold you  
Cos tonight you're gonna see  
I'm gonna give you love in the natural way  
And keep you here with me  
Lovin' like you've never known  
Now at last We're on our own  
And I still love you now  
  
Oh, baby, we're here tonight  
We can make it last forever  
We can make it last for life  
Oh, babe, it's me and you  
And it's a natural reaction  
When you feel the way we do  
What is left that's still unknown  
Let's discover on our own  
  
Cos when love's the culmination  
Of everything you feel  
Well it's the only thing that's precious  
It's the only thing that's real

Love is holy, don't forget it  
It will heal you if you let it  
Love will strip you, leave you naked  
Love is sexy, love is sacred  
  
I put my faith in me and you  
Somehow I know that we'll put through  
Oh I feel my life passing by  
Sometimes it makes me want to cry  
Thank God I've got you by my side  
  
Every night I hope and pray  
Nothing takes your love away  
I lie awake just to watch you breathe  
Love is holy when you lay with me  
Love is holy baby stay with me  
  
I don't understand the world today  
Is everything made just to throw away  
But you and I (you and I)  
Get closer as time goes by (till I die)  
I feel my love intensify  
Baby you're a spiritual high  
  
Every night I hope and pray  
Nothing takes your love away  
I lie awake just to watch you breathe  
Love is holy when you lay with me  
Love is holy baby stay with me  
  
Love is holy, don't forget it  
It will heal you if you let it  
Love will strip you, leave you naked  
Love is sexy, love is sacred  
  
Every night I hope and pray  
Nothing takes your love away  
I lie awake just to watch you breathe  
Love is holy when you lay with me  
Love is holy baby stay with me  
(Every night I hope and pray)  
(Nothing takes your love away)  
I lie awake just to watch you breathe  
Love is holy when you lay with me  
Love is holy baby stay with me

Take all your goodness and shiness away  
I'll tell you the things I've been longing to say  
I'll break it to you just so you understand  
The force and control that you hold in your hands  
  
Make me the beat of your heart  
Then fall into mine  
One step at a time  
You have no reason for doubting your feelings  
Love isn't always the same  
  
You are loved  
You are loved  
You are loved  
You I love  
You  
  
You are loved  
You are loved  
You are loved  
You I love  
You  
  
(Oh you are loved)  
  
Live for the moment according to you  
And so when the time comes you know what to do  
Trust me, I'm giving no secret away  
I'm drowning in you but I want it that way  
  
Make me the beat of your heart  
Then fall into mine  
One step at a time  
You have no reason for doubting your feelings  
Love isn't always the same  
  
You are loved  
You are loved  
You are loved  
You I love

You are loved  
You I love  
You  
  
Rise to my world, fly to my arms  
I love you  
I'll make it for good, I'll make it forever  
you know you are loved  
  
Make me the beat of your heart  
Love isn't always the same  
You are loved  
Ooh you are loved

(Loved you are loved)  
Ooh you are loved

You I love  
You  
(You are the only one I love)

Some people don't seem real at all  
Unafraid of any mountain  
Sure that the gods won't let him fall  
Should he fall, he will always get up again  
And if he's hurt he never shows it  
If he's wrong nobody knows it  
Seems like he never has to try  
He just must be a lucky guy  
And when there's pain he never minds it  
When it's lost he always finds it  
Nobody really knows just why  
He just must be a lucky guy  
He just must be a lucky guy  
I wish I was that lucky guy  

Featuring you keep me hangin' on, another step (closer to you) and say you
really want me.  
  
(we keep in touch)  
(keep me hangin' on)  
  
Set me free why don't cha babe  
Get out of my life why don't cha babe  
'cause you don't really love me  
You just keep me hangin'on  
  
Set me free why don't cha babe  
Get out of my life why don't cha babe  
You don't really need me  
But you keep me hangin'on  
  
Why do you keep a comin' around  
Playing with my heart  
Why don't cha get out of my life  
And let me make a brand new start  
Let me get over you  
The way you've gotten over me yeah  
  
Set me free why don't cha babe  
Get out of my life why don't cha babe  
'cause you don't really love me  
You just keep me hangin'on  
No you don't really need me  
You just keep me (keep me) hangin' on  
  
You say although we broke up  
You still just wanna be friends  
But how can we still be friends  
When seeing you only breaks my heart again  
(and there ain't nothing I can do about it)  
  
(keep me hangin' on)  
(yeah)  
Get out, get out of my life  
And let me sleep at night  
Cause you don't really love me  
You just keep me (keep me) hangin'on  
(keep me hangin' on)  
(keep me hangin' on)  
(keep me hangin' on)  
  
Another step nearer your heart  
Another step closer to knowing you

Junior: I never thought it could happen  
Being close to someone like you

Why you always got to be so cool  
And why I always got to play your fool  
You don't really know what life's about  
Oh no  
So baby come and let your feelings out  
  
Say you really want me  
Don't keep it to yourself  
Say you really need me  
Just me and no one else  
Say you really love me  
Ooh let me know it's true  
Say you really want me  
The way that I want you  
  
(love me)  
(cause you don't really love me)  
(love me)  
(love me)  
  
I need somebody through the thick and the thin  
Cause I know the problems of today  
The time is over now for playing those games  
Lets take it all the way  
  
Say you really want me  
(say you want me)  
Say you really need me

Say you really love me

Say you love me

I knew there was a danger  
But couldn't resist  
The touch of a stranger  
The thrill of his kiss  
'cause this time  
I thought it was love  
I thought it was heaven  
Having the time of my life  
I know it's not true  
  
Oh never trust a stranger with your heart  
Oh no, never trust a stranger with your heart  
  
My world is in pieces  
You've stolen my pride  
And I'm left defeated  
And crushed by your lies  
  
Like a tiger you hunted and tracked me down  
Savaged my soul and took over control  
And then when you'd used all the love you found  
You left without trace  
Not a note or a single goodbye  
I thought it was love  
I thought it was heaven  
Having the time of my life  
I know it's not true  
  
Oh never trust a stranger with your heart  
Oh no, never trust a stranger with your heart

Nobody does it better  
Makes me feel sad for the rest  
Nobody does it half as good as you  
Baby, you're the best  
  
I wasn't lookin' but somehow you found me  
It tried to hide from your love light  
But like heaven above me  
The spy who loved me  
Is keepin' all my secrets safe tonight  
  
And nobody does it better  
Though sometimes I wish someone could  
Nobody does it quite the way you do  
Why'd you have to be so good?  
  
The way that you hold me  
Whenever you hold me  
There's some kind of magic inside you  
That keeps me from runnin'  
But just keep it comin'  
How'd you learn to do the things you do?  
  
Oh, and nobody does it better  
Makes me feel sad for the rest  
Nobody does it half as good as you  
Baby, baby, darlin', you're the best  
  
Baby you're the best  
Darlin', you're the best  
Baby you're the best

I will always love you  
Now and forever  
I will always love you  
Two words collide  
Before we knew what was happening  
Love crashed into our lives  
So helplessly we fell so hard  
Guess something had to break  
We made our first mistake  
We thought we'd found the answer over night  
To all the problems that were in our lives  
And now I feel the tears  
And not a minute passes by  
When I don't wish  
That you were near  
Time will never mend (oh no)  
This broken heart  
Now and forever  
I will always love you  
Pain that never ends (oh oh)  
You can be sure  
Now and forever  
I will always love you  
When you hear my name  
Tell me how do you fell  
Is it just like me  
My heart fills up with pain  
Just the mention of you makes me fall apart  
But where is there to start  
You sais we missed our chance and it's too late  
But I believe there's one more chance to take  
I know we said goodbye  
But I still can't let go  
Please give us one more try  
Time will never mend (oh no)  
This broken heart  
Now and forever  
I will always love you  
Pain that never ends (oh oh)  
You can be sure  
Now and forever  
I will always love you  
Think again before you walk away  
There's so many reasons you should stay  
It's our destiny  
It how it's got to be  
Just you and me  
No matter where you go  
No matter what you do  
You know I'm gonna be right here for you  
I will always love you  
Giving you my heart  
Giving you my soul  
Never ever gonna let you go  
I will always love you

This is your town, this is my place  
This is where my whole world is lived in  
Nothing much, and just out of reach of all the city lights  
It's a high town, it's a low town  
It's get here, come on you grow town  
No-one does, but everyone thinks they're gonna make it soon  
This is one place I respected  
Now I feel it's really dejected  
No-one cares and the people just stare  
And a man on the box says  
"Hey you, don't walk away, vote for me  
You'll get more pay, keep working hard"  
But they work slow  
  
Here it comes now, Sunday morning  
Just another sleepy town yawning  
Down below everything looks just like another day  
But, in the warm glow of the sunrise  
There's a child who's searching with young eyes  
Looking 'round and feeling inside he's gonna fly away  
There was one time I was leaving  
But the folks around me kept grieving  
Friends said go, but my dad said no  
And my mum kept saying  
"Don't go, don't go away  
Don't leave us, you've got to stay  
Just raise them kids, oh mother no"  
  
No prospects, just projects  
Don't try to tell me we're living  
There's no real need to try  
Can't you see this town gonna die  
  
Hail the new age, it's a rat cage  
Join the place for breeding dumb spieces  
All stacked up and doing whatever someone tells you to  
Burn the place down, make it dead ground  
Show the people just what they're missing  
Wake up, wake up, can't you believe in what I'm telling you  
There's a house where I was born in  
Now it's changed without any warning  
Cranes just crash and bricks just smash  
While a billboard's saying  
"Let's go, let's get away  
Come fly me, you've weeks to pay  
When sunshine calls, but I won't go  
  
This is our town

Ten little Indians  
Standin' in a row  
All dressed up  
But nowhere to go  
Lookin' for a target  
Lookin' for a man ........  
  
Just get me outta here  
It's not the place  
My mind's been thinkin' on  
Just push me out again  
It's no use hangin' round or hangin'on  
  
Seven little Indians  
Standin' in a row  
The compere walks on the stage and he says  
"Sing it Girls"  
But the band's no good  
And the song don't cut it  
  
Just get me outta here  
It's not the place  
My mind's been thinkin' on  
Just push me out again  
It's no use hangin' round or hangin'on  
  
Come on, let's go tonight  
We gotta brand new way to celebrate it  
Oh - I got this rage to love  
Baby - it's so right  
And if you feel it ...  
Good !  
Dedicate it  
Oh - I got this rage to love  
  
Three little indians  
Cryin' in their make-up  
Nobody stops  
And nobody cares  
  
Just get me outta here  
It's not the place  
My mind's been thinkin' on  
Just push me out again  
It's no use hangin' round or hangin'on  
  
Come on let's go tonight  
We gotta brand new way to celebrate it  
Oh - I got this rage to love  
Baby it's so right  
And if you feel it...  
Good !  
Dedicate it  
Oh I got this rage to...  
Oh it's just this rage to... Oh I got this rage to love

Why you always got to be so cool  
And why I always got to play your fool  
You don't really know what life's about  
Baby come and let your feelings out  
  
Say you really want me  
Don't keep it to yourself  
Say you really need me  
Just me and no one else  
Say you really love me  
Ooh let me know it's true  
Say you really want me  
The way that I want you tonight  
  
You don't know a thing about romance  
Deep inside you're scared to take the chance  
'Cause love like this may never come again  
Make your move or I'll be in the wind  
  
I need somebody through the thick and the thin  
'Cause I know the problems of today  
The time is over now for playing those games  
Lets take it all the way

It's something else to see the way you're growing  
From a sweet little baby to a grown up girl  
And I pray though darlin' I've no way to knowing  
That you'll discover a beautiful world  
As you skip down the street and hold your books so tightly  
Tell me what are you learning in your ABC  
Are you dreaming off all the many things you might be  
You know that we're just waiting to see  
Schoolgirl, you're such an inspiration  
Schoolgirl and you're as fresh as the breeze  
You've got the whole world just waiting for you  
You're really something, something to see  
It's easy to worry in a world of trouble  
When there's nothing but bad news trying to bring you down  
But life doesn't have to be an uphill struggle  
There's still some wonderful things to be found  
Schoolgirl, you're such an inspiration  
Schoolgirl and you're as fresh as the breeze  
You've got the whole world just waiting for you  
You're really something, something to see  
There is sadness and confusion in our hearts  
And the world prepares to fight  
As it tears itself apart, it isn't fair  
Schoolgirl, you're such an inspiration  
Schoolgirl and you're as fresh as the breeze  
You've got the whole world waiting for you  
Girl, you're really something, something to see  
You're little schoolgirl  
You're as fresh as the breeze  
You've got the whole world waiting for you  
You're really something, something to see  
Little schoolgirl, you're such an inspiration  
Schoolgirl and you're as fresh as the breeze  
You've got the whole world waiting for you  
Girl, you're really something, something to see  

Mirrored in your face  
Is a look that says it all  
  
Boy I'm slow  
I've been uncertain  
Just couldn't be sure  
Now I know  
  
You say it's over  
But just how long have you known  
(You better go now)  
But as you leave me  
  
Shoot to disable  
Shoot to disable  
  
Maybe I got careless  
Maybe it's true I ran too fast  
But on recollection it didn't do much  
So I pass  
  
You're such a hard man  
Why can't you take steady aim  
(Just get it over with)  
Don't fool around now  
  
Shoot to disable  
Shoot to disable  
  
Oh what a fool I was to love

As performed in the musical "tommy"  
Written by pete townsend  
  
You don't answer my call  
With even a nod or a twitch  
But you gaze at your own reflection!  
You don't seem to see me  
But I think you can see yourself  
How can the mirror affect you?  
  
Can you hear me?  
Or do I surmise  
That you fear me  
Can you feel my temper  
Rise, rise, rise, rise, rise...  
  
Do you hear or fear or do I smash the mirror?  
Do you hear or fear or do I smash the mirror?

Well they'll tease you and they'll please you  
Make you better when you're feeling bad  
All hope is gone - singing  
Songs about love  
  
They'll upset you and they'll get you  
Slay your fantasy till you almost believe  
You're the only one - singing  
(songs about love)  
  
So don't believe they're writing all those songs for you  
Oh no 'cos you know they're only lies you're listening to  
Those songs about love  
  
It's all over now and nothing's right  
You're left crying every night  
(it ain't fair) oh no no  
(it ain't fair) singing all about love  
  
They'll deceive you, now they'll leave you  
Leave you so confused don't you know you've been used  
Now can't you see - singing  
All about love  
  
So don't believe they're writing all those songs for you  
Oh no 'cos you know they're only lies you're listening to

You're left crying every night  
(it ain't fair) oh no no

Don't you see it's just not right  
To keep your feelings out of sight  
(feeling bad) oh no no  
(feeling bad) singing songs about love  
  
And if we'd never meet again  
(what would you do with your life)  
Do you think we could be friends  
(or would it hurt you hurt you)  
Don't you see they got to you and me  
With all their songs about love  
  
Well you know now, better go now  
Gonna mend your heart it's a brand new start  
Don't be afraid - singing  
Songs about love

Those songs about love

Don't you see it's just not right  
To leave your feelings out of sight  
Oh no no  
Singing songs about love

I'm touching your face and I  
Can't get very far  
You travel a million miles  
Always in the stars  
And crossing the clouds  
A fading moon  
Whispered "It's goodbye"  
But as it starts to die  
  
Stay awhile  
Show your love  
Child among the stars  
Just stay awhile  
Lay with me  
Tell me who you are  
  
I've never believed in much  
What can I be worth ?  
I'm always a shooting star  
Falling down to earth  
I prayed in my heart  
You'd never know  
Feelings wouldn't show  
But now before you go  
  
Stay awhile  
Show your love  
Child among the stars  
Just stay awhile  
Lay with me  
Tell me who you are  
  
And crossing the clouds  
A fading moon  
Whispers "It's goodbye"  
But as it starts to die  
  
Stay awhile  
Show your love  
Child among the stars  
Just stay awhile  
Lay with me  
Show me who you are  
  
Just stay awhile

(I'm gonna stay... (I'm gonna stay...))  
  
The pain inside  
When you think you love another  
But can't decide which way to go  
And you're searching for a reason to leave his side  
In time you'll see  
It has to be this way  
And though it hurts to say  
I'm gonna be staying with my baby  
  
(I'm gonna stay... (I'm gonna stay...))  
I know he's good for me  
I can see that he's feeling down  
(I'm gonna stay... (I'm gonna stay...))  
But I know he cares for me  
And in time he will come around  
So dry your eyes, before you turn away  
You must know that I'll always love you  
But now, I'm staying with my baby  
  
You used to say  
I should maybe take it further  
And leave one day  
My family - but I'm responsible for them  
They depend on me  
So now you see, our love is history  
I'm sad it has to end  
But I'm gonna be staying with my baby  
  
(I'm gonna stay... (I'm gonna stay...))  
I know he's good for me  
I can see that he's feeling down  
(I'm gonna stay... (I'm gonna stay...))  
But I know he cares for me  
And in time he will come around  
So dry your eyes, before you turn away  
You must know that I'll always love you  
But now, I'm staying with my baby  
(I'm staying with my baby... yes I am)  
  
Please understand  
He's just a desperate man  
Who's doing all he can  
So I'm going back  
  
(I'm gonna stay... (I'm gonna stay...))  
I know he's good for me  
I can see that he's feeling down  
(I'm gonna stay... (I'm gonna stay...))  
But I know he cares for me  
And in time he will come around  
(I'm gonna stay... (I'm gonna stay...))  
I'm gonna stay  
(I'm gonna stay... (I'm gonna stay...))  
I'm gonna stay

There was a lot to make up  
For the time we'd had  
'Cause we'd been lonely far too long  
Had enough of feeling sad  
And no, it didn't take long  
To right all the wrong  
And hurt inside  
And now i can't believe what's happening  
Right before my eyes  
  
Just look at the rain falling  
Look at the thunder  
Look at the storm in your hearts  
Look at the waves crashing  
Pulling us under  
Helplessly lost in the dark  
  
We could have lost so easily  
And let it go  
We had no reason to believe  
That love was just about to grow  
And we got given a chance  
I'm so proud we didn't throw it away  
'Cause broken hearts lie on the pavement  
You see them every day  
  
Just look at the rain falling  
Look at the thunder  
Look at the thunder  
Look at the storm in your hearts  
Look at the waves crashing  
Pulling us under  
Helplessly lost in the dark  
In the dark  
  
Just look at the rain falling  
Look at the thunder  
Look at the storm in your hearts  
Look at the waves crashing  
Pulling us under  
Helplessly lost in the dark  
  
Look at the rain  
Look at the thunder  
Look at the storm  
In our hearts  
In our hearts

Out on my own  
In the suburbs of Moscow  
Out in the rain  
Walking down this long avenue  
  
Out to the crowds in the square  
Feelings are high everywhere  
  
But the feeling is gone  
And I can't break away  
(living in Moscow)  
Out in the cold  
(so cold)  
When there's nowhere to stay  
  
Look at the girl  
Gazing through the window  
Clutching her books  
Memorizing every line  
  
Keep your belief at the start  
This was the faith in my heart  
  
But the feeling is gone  
And I can't break away  
(living in Moscow)  
Out in the cold  
(so cold)  
When there's nowhere to stay  
  
Where can we go  
In the suburbs of Moscow  
Watching the rain  
Beating down empty streets  
  
Yes, the feeling is gone  
And I can't break away  
(living in Moscow)  
Out in the cold  
(so cold)  
When there's nowhere to stay

Thinking about what a friend just said  
You know nothing good comes easy  
You took the thought right from my head  
You only seem to tease me  
Then you turn  
(It on again)  
Then you turn  
(Me on again)  
Then I learn the answers to all my questions  
Now some thing's taking over  
It's the thrill of it, the thrill of it  
It's the thrill of it  
(Turn me on)  
It's the thrill of it can you feel it  
The thrill of it, it's taking me over  
Now what am I supposed to do  
You know it can't go on much longer  
Every time when I'm near you  
You know the feelings so much stronger  
Then you turn  
(It on again)  
Then you turn  
(Me on again)  
Then I learn the answers to all my questions  
Now some thing's taking over  
It's the thrill of it, the thrill of it  
It's the thrill of it  
(Turn me on)  
It's the thrill of it can you feel it  
The thrill of it  
It's the thrill of it  
(Turn me on)  
It's the thrill of it can you feel it  
It's taking me over  
You know it's taking me over  
You know it's taking me over  
Then you turn  
(It on again)  
Then you turn  
(Me on again)  
Then I learn the answers to all my questions  
Now some thing's taking over  
It's the thrill of it, the thrill of it  
It's the thrill of it  
(Turn me on)  
It's the thrill of it can you feel it  
It's the thrill of it  
(Turn me on)  
It's the thrill of it, the thrill of it  
It's the thrill of it  
(Turn me on)  
It's the thrill of it can you feel it  
It's the thrill of it  
(Turn me on)  
It's the thrill of it  
(Turn me on)  
It's the thrill of it can you feel it  

I can't see your face  
Hear the excuses for  
The mistakes that you make  
I've heard all your lies  
I don't know how much I can take  
Before I break  
I've tried to be so strong  
While you broke the promises  
All the vows that we made  
We know something's wrong  
But we carry on anyway  
Day by day  
You're the one who let me down  
And now I find it hard to forgive  
In my heart  
  
[Chorus]  
But I'll try again  
To forget all the pain  
And love you again  
I'll try again  
Though you hurt me I know  
I can't let you go  
  
How can we forget  
The sweetness of yesterday  
We just can't let it go  
Lost in bitterness  
I'm losing my self control  
And my soul  
Cause you'll be the one who let me down  
And now I find it hard to forgive  
In my mind  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh why, why do we hurt each other more  
When there's a way  
Cause we never really found  
What we were looking for  
Can we try again  
  
Cause you're the one who let me down  
And now I find it hard to forgive  
In my heart  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, I'll try again

Cruising 'round there's a sound with a place to go  
Tuning in tuning on like a radio  
Fell the sound in your head and you set the seal  
I believe it's a force of the life you feel - Tuning on  
  
Do you know what the sounds that you hear will find  
Reach to space to the stars and another time  
I believe that they search like a seed to grow  
In the end it's the same anyway you go  
  
I really can't explain  
I really can't explain  
  
Crashing out for the last and the final time  
Could a sound and a soul travel on combined  
From the womb to the end is it everywhere  
Feel the beat of my heart and you know it's there  
  
I really can't explain  
  
[SPOKEN]  
  
I really believe that sound reaches infinity, do you know what I mean. I think
it goes on and on forever, and if that's true and it was linked to the
spiritual side of your lives, well, then sounds could be alive. Can you
imagine the possibilities for the future ? Linking the soul and the sound and
then being able to make a giant spiritual musical machine, actually a part of
us and not just something you hear - it's fantastic - it's just fantastic  
  
I really can't explain

Cascading down  
There's a sound vaporising into vision  
It's a sound in my head  
That I feel and it shuts me in a prison  
  
Say it won't last  
Say it will pass  
Always the sound in my brain  
Can you hear it  
  
Water on glass running down again  
Water on glass that sound  
Water on glass running round again  
Help me, the sound of running water's  
Coming down  
  
Dancing away  
Like the lights on a moving coloured river  
Sounds in my head seem to run  
And again I feel a shiver  
  
Say it won't last  
Pray it will pass  
Always that sound in my brain  
Can you hear it (Can you hear it)  
  
Water on glass running down again  
Water on glass that sound  
Water on glass running round again  
Help me, the sound of running water's  
Coming down  
  
Water on glass running down again  
Water on glass that sound  
Water on glass running round again  
Help me, the sound of running water's  
Coming down

A long time ago, you promised yourself  
They're all gonna know me someday  
Well, you got what you wanted but look at you now  
You lost something good on the way  
So where did it go? Tell me, where did it go?  
But you wouldn't know  
Snap your fingers and somebody runs  
You don't care how they feel just as long as they come  
Got your head in the stars, now you've come this far  
Just who do you think you are?  
Now everything seems to be going your way  
And everyone loves what they see  
But you ruin it all with the things that you say  
So tell me, how does it feel?  
When you're all alone, how does it feel?  
You're alone, nothing is real  
Snap your fingers and somebody runs  
You don't care how they feel just as long as they come  
Got your head in the stars, now you've come this far  
Just who do you think you are?  
You believe a ridiculous lie  
You can't see you've become all the things you despise  
But I know who you are and you've gone too far  
Just who do you think you are?  
You can keep all your dreams  
But you don't have to lose yourself  
'Cause one day, you're gonna break  
When the face in the mirror looking back at you  
Is a stranger that you can't place, oh, oh  
Just who do you think you are?  
Snap your fingers and somebody runs  
You don't care how they feel just as long as they come  
Got your head in the stars, now you've come this far  
Just who do you think you are?  
You believe a ridiculous lie  
You can't see you've become all the things you despise  
But I know who you are and you've gone too far  
Just who do you think you are?  
Oh, oh, oh, just who do you think you are?  

I wake up in the morning, looking for reaction  
Then I see your faces, only for fraction  
Did you hurt my feelings ? You just nailed me to the wall  
  
Never say you're sorry, never show emotion  
Never show a good hand, never give a notion  
Don't you feel it's obscene ? Do you feel a thing at all ?  
  
[Chorus:]  
'cause you come right back with the same old story  
Words fell down  
Words fell down  
You walk right back to the sound of glory  
Words fell down  
Words fell down  
Oh, oh, oh, it's so helpless  
Oh, oh, oh, it's so helpless, it's so helpless  
  
Always a deceiver, never any answers  
Living in the shadows, taking any chances  
When you get a good line, come and talk in to my face  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You fight right back with the same reaction  
Words fell down  
Words fell down  
The same old show with the same old caption  
Words fell down  
Words fell down  
Oh, oh, oh, it's so helpless  
Oh, oh, oh, it's so helpless, it's so helpless

Someone I know is staring at me  
And when I look into her eyes  
I see a girl that I used to be  
I hardly recognize  
'cause in the space of a year  
I've watched the old me disappear  
All of the things I once held precious  
Just don't mean anything anymore  
'cause suddenly  
  
You came, and changed the way I feel  
No one could love you more  
Because you came and turned my life around  
No one could take your place  
  
I've never felt good with permanent things  
Now I don't want anything to change  
You can't imagine the joy you bring  
My life won't be the same  
And I'll be there when you call  
I'll pick you up if you should fall  
'cause I have never felt such inspiration  
Nobody else ever gave me more because  
  
You came, and changed the way I feel  
No one could love you more  
Because you came and turned my life around  
No one could take your place  
  
I watch you sleep in the still of the night  
You look so pretty when you dream  
So many people just go through life  
Holding back, they don't say what they mean  
But it's easy for me  
Since you came  
No one could love you more  
Because you came and turned my life around  
No one could take your place  
You came, and changed the way I feel  
No one could love you more  
Because you came and turned my life around  
No one could take your place

(Keep me hangin' on)  
  
Set me free why don't cha babe  
Get out my life why don't cha babe  
'Cause you don't really love me  
You just keep me hangin' on

Let me get over you the way you gotten over me, yeah, yeah

'Cause you don't really love me  
You just keep me hangin' on  
No, you don't really need me  
You just keep me hangin' on  
  
You say although we broke up you still just wanna be friends  
But how can we still be friends when seeing you only breaks my heart again  
(And there ain't nothing I can do about it)  
  
Whoa, ooh, whoa, ooh, whoa  
Whoa, ooh, whoa, ooh, whoa, whoa  
Whoa, ooh, whoa, ooh, whoa, whoa  
Whoa, ooh, whoa, ooh, whoa,  
Yeah, yeah  
  
Get out, get out of my life  
And let me sleep at night  
'Cause you don't really love me  
You just keep me hangin' on  
  
You say you still care for me but your heart and soul needs to be free  
And now that you've got your freedom you wanna still hold on to me  
You don't want me for yourself so let me find somebody else  
  
Set me free why don't cha babe  
Get out my life why don't cha babe (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)  
'Cause you don't really love me  
You just keep me hangin' on  
  
Why don't cha be a man about it and set me free (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)  
Now you don't care a thing about me  
You're just using me, hey, abusing me  
  
Get out, get out of my life  
And let me sleep at night (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)  
'Cause you don't really love me  
You just keep me hangin' on (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

Everyone round keeps putting us down, let it go  
It's the same old play in a grown up day  
It's a stinging sensation  
Hanging round on every corner  
Where, all the young kids I know want to be  
  
We only want to stay young, we only want to be free  
He doesn't want to be you, she doesn't want to be me  
We're all young heroes  
We're all young heroes  
  
Shouted down pushed and we're gettin' real bushed  
Just have your say and we'll do it your way  
If it makes you fell better  
Nothing much to add to what I say  
'cause I know just how it fells to be  
  
We only want to stay young, we only want to be free  
He doesn't want to be you, she doesn't want to be me  
We're all young heroes  
We're all young heroes  
  
We only want to be free
