Hear the bells ringing  
They're singing that you can be born again  
Hear the bells ringing  
They're singing Christ is risen from the dead  
  
The angel up on the tombstone  
Said He has risen, just as He said  
Quickly now, go tell his disciples  
That Jesus Christ is no longer dead  
  
Joy to the word, He has risen, hallelujah  
He's risen, hallelujah  
He's risen, hallelujah  
  
Hear the bells ringing  
They're singing that you can be healed right now  
Hear the bells ringing, they're singing  
Christ, He will reveal it now  
  
The angels, they all surround us  
And they are ministering Jesus' power  
Quickly now, reach out and receive it  
For this could be your glorious hour  
  
Joy to the world, He has risen, hallelujah  
He's risen, hallelujah  
He's risen, hallelujah, hallelujah  
  
The angel up on the tombstone  
Said He has risen, just as He said  
Quickly now, go tell his disciples  
That Jesus Christ is no longer dead  
  
Joy to the world, He has risen, hallelujah  
He's risen, hallelujah  
He's risen, hallelujah  
Hallelujah

Glory Lord Jesus, glory to your Holy Name.  
Glory Lord Jesus, your blood,  
It has removed my shame.  
When the Son of Man returns,  
Will He find faith on the Earth?  
Well I hope so, I want to be found ready.  
  
Holy, Lord Jesus, holy is your righteous throne.  
Holy, Lord Jesus, my praises go to you alone.  
Worthy art thou Lord our God,  
To receive all glory honor and power,  
For there is none beside thee.  
  
Faith is believin', faith is for overcoming.  
And if I'm going to love you.  
I sure got to trust you.  
  
Faith is believin', faith is for overcoming.  
And if I'm going to love you.  
I sure got to trust you.  
  
Glory Lord Jesus, glory to your Holy Name.  
Forevermore you'll never change.  
When the Son of Man returns,  
Will He find faith on the Earth?  
Well I hope so, I want to be found ready.  
  
I wanna be found ready.  
I want to be ready, Lord help me be ready.  
Please let me be found ready, I wanna be ready.  
Oh, Lord help me be ready.  
I wanna be found ready, I wanna be ready.  
Lord help me  
  
Glory Lord Jesus,  
Glory to your Holy Name.  
Glory Lord Jesus,  
Your blood has removed my shame.  
  
Glory Lord Jesus,  
Glory to your Holy Name.  
Glory Lord Jesus,  
For evermore you'll never change.

Go to the hungry ones and fill them with his bread,  
They'll leave their darkness as you shine the light he shed,  
Point to his promises, believe in what he said,  
And his joy will be manifest in you,  
And the lost will be found as he works through you.  
Out on the highways, theres so many passing by,  
Step out in boldness and watch the family multiply,  
Pray up some miracles, lets open up the sky,  
And his joy will be manifest to you,  
And the lost will be found by the things you do.  
Oh dont you know that jesus loves you,  
So lets go and spread his word,  
Redeem the time while theres still time,  
Lets share the call we heard, lets share the call we heard.  
Is your house open to let strangers enter there,  
Give to the least of them, show them someone cares,  
And you may be entertaining angels unaware,  
And his joy may be manifest to you,  
And the lost may be found as he works through you,  
And his joy will be manifest in you,  
And the lost, theyll be found by the things you do.

Lord, the feelings are not the same,  
I guess I'm older, I guess I've changed.  
And how I wish it had been explained, that as you're growing you must
remember,  
That nothing lasts, except the grace of God, by which I stand, in Jesus.  
I know that I would surely fall away, except for grace, by which I'm saved.  
  
Lord, I remember that special way,  
I vowed to serve you, when it was brand new.  
But like Peter, I can't even watch and pray, one hour with you,  
And I bet, I could deny you too.  
But nothing lasts, except the grace of God, by which I stand, in Jesus.  
I'm sure that my whole life would waste away, except for grace, by which I'm
saved.  
But nothing lasts, except the grace of God, by which I stand, in Jesus.  
I know that I would surely fall away, except for grace, by which I'm saved.

You know, it ain't no use  
Banging your head  
Up against a cold stone wall  
'Cause no one perfect  
Except for the Lord--  
Even the best's bound to fall  
  
Remember,  
He is the vine  
And you are the branch  
He loves to get you through it if you give him a chance  
You just keep doing your best  
And pray that it's blessed  
And Jesus takes care of the rest  
  
Yes the Lord said He'll take care of the rest  
He's gonna do it!  
He'll take care of the rest  
He'll see you through it, yeah  
He'll take care of the rest  
The devil blew it!  
(Old pharaoh blew it)  
(His neighbors blew it)  
Well He'll take care of the  
He'll take care of the rest  
  
You just think about Moses  
In front of the burning bush  
Barefoot on the holy ground  
You know he must've been thinking

Oh Lord, there's just so much to be done.  
Oh Lord, so many souls to be won,  
Oh Lord, this world is falling apart,  
Dying for love from a broken heart.  
  
Here am I, send me, though there's really not that much I can do.  
What I have seems so small, but I want to give it all to you.  
  
Oh Lord, you said the harvest was great,  
But Lord, looks like the workers are late.  
It's getting hard to understand,  
How they ignore your great command.  
  
Here am I, send me, though you said the ones who labor are few,  
Still my heart hears the call, and I wanna give it all to you.  
Oh, to reach the ones nobody does,  
Give up my pride and even work in the mud,  
I wanna be like those who spilled their blood,  
And gave it like water to you.  
  
Oh Lord, there's just so much to be done.  
Oh Lord, so many souls to be won,  
It seem this world is falling apart,  
Lord won't you send me?  
  
Oh Lord, there's just so much to be done.  
Oh Lord, so many souls to be won,  
Oh Lord, this world is falling apart,  
Crying for love from a broken heart.  
  
Here am I, send me, though there's really not that much I can do.  
What I have seems so small, but I want to give it all to you.  
Here am I, send me,  
Though you said the ones you've chosen are few,  
Still my heart hears you call,  
And I wanna give it all to you.

Oh Lord, our Lord,  
How majestic is thy name in all the Earth.  
Oh Lord, our Lord,  
How majestic is thy name in all the Earth.  
  
Thou has displayed thy splendor above the heavens.  
Thou has established strength from mouths of infants,  
To show all thine enemies.  
  
Oh Lord, our Lord,  
How majestic is thy name in all the Earth.  
Oh Lord, our Lord,  
How majestic is thy name in all the Earth.  
  
For when I consider the heavens the work of thy fingers.  
The moon and the sun which thou hast appointed.  
For what is man, that thou dost take thought of him,  
And the son of man, that thou doest care for him.  
  
Hallelujah Lord our Lord,  
Oh how I love you.  
Hallelujah Lord our Lord,  
Oh how I love you.  
  
You've made man a little lower than all of the angels,  
And crowned him with glory to rule over your creation.  
And under his feet,  
You've put the beasts of the field,  
The birds of the heavens and what passes through the seas,  
The birds of the heavens and what passes through the sea.  
  
Hallelujah Lord our Lord,  
Oh how I love you.  
Hallelujah Lord our Lord,  
Oh how I love you.  
  
Hallelujah Lord our Lord,  
Oh how I love you.  
Hallelujah Lord our Lord,  
Oh how I love you

As each day passes by,  
I feel my love run dry.  
I get so weary, worn,  
And tossed around in the storm.  
Well I'm blind to others needs,  
And I'm tired of planting seeds.  
I seem to have a wealth,  
Of so many thoughts about myself.  
  
I want to, I need to, be more like Jesus.  
I want to, I need to, be more like him.  
  
Our fathers will was done,  
By giving us his son,  
Who paid the highest cost,  
To point us to the cross.  
And when I think of him,  
Taking on the whole worlds sin,  
I take one look at me,  
Compared to what I'm called to be.  
  
I want to, I need to, be more like Jesus.  
I want to, I need to, be more like him.  
  
Remember, there's no greater love,  
Then to lay down your life for a friend.  
The end of all my prayers,  
Is to care like my lord cares.  
My one and only goal,  
His image in my soul.  
Yes my weakness is revealed,  
When by his stripes I'm healed.  
Hes faithful and hes true,  
To complete the work he begins in you.

I will give thanks to the lord  
With all my heart  
I will tell of all thy wonders  
I will be glad and exult in thee  
  
I will trust in you my god  
Who delivered me  
And lifted me from the gates of death  
I will be glad and exult in thee  
  
I will give thanks to the lord  
With all my heart  
I will tell of all thy wonders  
I will be glad and exult in thee  
  
I will tell of all thy wonders  
I will be glad and exult in thee

If you love the lord, you will love his will for you.  
Instead of questions why, there'll be praise for all he brings you through.  
And if you love the lord, you will love his holy commands.  
Delight yourself in them, and everything you do will surely stand.  
  
We are his workmanship, created for good works in Christ.  
He calls us to offer up ourselves a living sacrifice.  
  
Well if you love the lord, his discipline you wont despise.  
Cause it will prove to you, that you're a child in his eyes.  
And if you love the lord, you'll seek his face with all your heart.  
And even when you're old, from his holy place you wont depart.  
  
We are his workmanship, created for good works in Christ.  
He calls us to offer up ourselves a living sacrifice.  
We are his workmanship, created for good works in Christ.  
He calls us to offer up ourselves a living sacrifice..  
We are his workmanship, created for good works in Christ.  
He calls us to offer up ourselves a living sacrifice.  
We are his workmanship, created for good works in Christ.  
He calls us to offer up ourselves a living sacrifice..

Jesus commands us to go,  
  
But we go the other way.  
  
So he carries the burden alone,  
  
While his children are busy at play,  
  
Feeling so called to stay.  
  
  
Oh, how God grieves and believes that the world can't be saved,  
  
Unless the ones he's appointed obeys,  
  
His command and his stand for the world,  
  
That he loved more than life.  
  
Oh he died, and he cries out tonight.  
  
Jesus commands us to go,  
  
It should be the exception if we stay.  
  
It's no wonder we're moving so slow,  
  
When his church refuses to obey,  
  
Feeling so called to stay.  
  
  
Oh how God comes, as he starts the great judgment of fire,  
  
So he can gain, his greatest desire.  
  
Cause he knows that the souls of the lost,  
  
They can only be reached, through us,  
  
We're his hands and his feet.  
  
  
Jesus commands us to go,  
  
It should be the exception if we stay.  
  
It's no wonder we're moving so slow,  
  
When god's children refuse to obey,  
  
Feeling so called to stay.

Who you gonna throw in the lake of fire,  
O God our Lord?  
Who you gonna throw when the flames get higher,  
O God our Lord?  
The Devil and the man with the dark desire,  
O God our Lord.  
The Devil and the man with the dark desire,  
O God our Lord.  
  
O God our Lord, O God our Lord.  
Who you gonna throw in the lake of fire,  
O God our Lord, O God our Lord.  
  
Will my name be there when the books are opened,  
O God our Lord.  
Will my name be there when the books are opened,  
O God our Lord.  
You better know now, don't just be hoping,  
O God our Lord.  
You better know now, don't just be hoping,  
O God our Lord.  
  
O God our Lord, O God our Lord.  
Well my name be there when the books are opened,  
O God our Lord, O God our Lord.  
  
Who's outside of the Holy City,  
O God our Lord.  
Tell me, who's left out of the Holy City,  
O God our Lord.  
The liar and the thief and the ones half ready,  
O God our Lord.  
The liar and the thief and the ones half ready,  
O God our Lord.  
  
O God our Lord, O God our Lord.  
Tell me who's left out of the Holy City,  
O God our Lord, O God our Lord.  
  
My, My, My Lord.  
I'm crying out to you master, oh Lord,  
Don't you know I need you, oh Lord.  
Have mercy on a poor sinner like me, Oh Jesus.  
Don't you know I need you, Oh Lord.

Oh Lord, You're beautiful  
Your face is all I seek  
For when Your eyes are on this child  
Your grace abounds to me  
  
Oh Lord, please light the fire  
That once burned bright and clean  
Replace the lamp of my first love  
That burns with holy fear  
  
I wanna take Your Word and shine it all around  
But first help me just to live it, Lord  
And when I'm doing well, help me to never seek a crown  
For my reward is giving glory to You

Hallelujah, God's been talking to ya,  
You can be what you're meant to be,  
But only by following Jesus.  
The kingdom come now,  
The devil is on the run now,  
And you can live for eternity,  
But only by following Jesus.  
  
Know where you're heading,  
'Cause it gets so upsetting,  
When your friends let you down,  
And there ain't no love around.  
Look straight ahead now,  
And learn what Jesus said,  
He would never forsake you.  
  
The time is short now.  
You've got to give him a good report now.  
And start living accordingly.  
It's getting hard now,  
You gotta start in your own backyard now.  
But it will be coming more easily.  
But only by following Jesus.  
  
Know where you're heading,  
'Cause there'll be no regretting.  
When you walk in that place,  
And see the glory on his face.  
Look straight ahead now,  
Remember what Jesus said,  
How he would come back for you.  
  
The world is dying,  
And you've been getting so tired of trying,  
But you'll be finding a remedy,  
Only by following Jesus.  
The time is coming,  
When those on earth will be hiding and running,  
From the Lamb of Eternity,  
'Cause they weren't following Jesus.  
No, no, they weren't following Jesus.  
No, no, they weren't following, they weren't following,  
They weren't following Jesus.  
Hallelujah, the Lord of Heaven's been talking to ya.  
Hallelujah, the Lord of Heaven's been talking to ya.

This generation of believers that you and me are a part of, we are responsible
for this generation of souls, all over the world. we're responsible for them.
we're responsible to pray daily for t  
Eds of ministries around the world, and ask god "how about me not sending my
money this time, how about me going?" it's so easy to write checks, it's so
easy. but god can't cash out of state checks in heaven. he needs you!  
  
Open your eyes to the world all around you, open your eyes, open your eyes.  
This world is much more than the things that surround you.  
You must arise, and open your eyes.  
Sometimes we're too busy to share, but jesus wants to care, to care.  
  
Open your arms to the naked and shivering, open your arms, open your arms.  
We need a little less taking, a whole lot more giving.  
We're so safe and warm, we can open our arms.  
And love a little bit stronger, and pray a little bit longer, longer.  
  
Jesus says, when we love someone in his name, we're loving him.  
Jesus says, when we touch someone in his name, we're touching him.  
And we've got to show them the light, we've got to pour out our lives.  
  
Open your hearts to the ones who are desperate, open your hearts, open your
hearts.  
They may never repay you, but their souls are worth it,  
The life you impart when you open your heart.  
Jesus loves all men the same,  
So we've got to go out in his name.  
  
Jesus says, when we touch someone in his name, we're touching him.  
Jesus says, when we love someone in his name, we're loving him.  
Jesus says, when we feed someone in his name, we're feeding him.  
And Jesus says, when we reach someone in his name,  
He feels, he says, it's all for him.  
It's all for him  
  
Open your eyes to the world all around you, open your eyes, open your eyes.  
This world is much more than the things that surround you.  
Jesus loves all men the same, so we've got to go out in his name.  
Jesus says, jesus says, jesus says, it's him.  
Jesus says, when we love someone in his name, we're loving him.

Well, I pledge my head to heaven for the gospel,  
And I ask no man on earth to fill my needs.  
Like the sparrow up above, I am enveloped in his love,  
And I trust him like those little ones, he feeds.  
  
Well I pledge my wife to heaven, for the gospel,  
Though our love each passing day just seems to grow.  
As I told her when we wed, Id surely rather be found dead,  
Than to love her more than the one who saved my soul.  
Im your child, and I want to be in your family forever.  
Im your child, and Im going to follow you,  
No matter whatever the cost, Im gonna count all things lost.  
  
Well I pledge my son to heaven for the gospel.  
Though hes kicked and beaten, ridiculed and scorn.  
I will teach him to rejoice, and life a thankful praising voice,  
And to be like him who bore the nails and crown of thorns.  
Im your child, and I want to be in your family forever.  
Im your child, and Im going to follow you,  
No matter whatever the cost, Im gonna count all things lost.  
Oh no matter whatever the cost, Im gonna count all things lost.  
  
Well Ive had the chance to gain the world, and to live just like a king,  
But without your love, it doesnt mean a thing.  
Oh no matter whatever the cost, Im gonna count all things lost,  
Oh no matter whatever the cost, Im gonna count all things lost.  
  
Well I pledge my son, I pledge my wife, I pledge my head to heaven,  
I pledge my son, I pledge my wife, I pledge my head to heaven, for the gospel.

Well you can run to the end of the highway and not find what youre looking
for,  
Moving wont make your troubles disappear.  
And you can search to the end of the highway and come back no better than
before.  
To find yourself youve got to start right here.  
Well I came running when I got the news that you were leaving.  
Oh, Ive gotta talk some sense to you, cause Im your friend.  
You say you want to hit the road cause life is so deceiving.  
Do you think its different at the other end?  
So you can run to the end of the highway and not find what youre looking for.  
Moving wont make your troubles disappear.  
And you can search to the end of the highway and come back no better than
before.  
To find yourself youve got to start right here.  
Oh I came running when I got the news that you were crying.  
Oh my friend has life been so unkind to you?  
You say you want to find a place where people are not lying.  
If you find a place like that Ill go there too.  
Oh, you can run to the end of the highway and not find what youre looking for.  
Moving wont make your troubles disappear.  
And you can search to the end of the highway and come back no better than
before.  
To find yourself youve got to start right here.  
Yes, to find yourself, youve got to start right here.

Rushing wind blow through this temple,  
Blowing out the dust within,  
Come and breathe you breath upon me,  
I've been born again.  
  
Holy spirit, I surrender, take me where you want to go,  
Plant me by your living water,  
Plant me deep so I can grow.  
  
Jesus, you're the one, who sets my spirit free,  
Use me lord, glorify, your holy name through me.  
Separate me from this world lord.  
Sanctify my life for you.  
Daily change me to your image,  
Help me bear good fruit.  
Every day you're drawing closer.  
  
Trials come to test my faith.  
But when all is said and done lord,  
You know, it was worth the wait.  
Jesus, you're the one, who set my spirit free,  
Use me lord, glorify, your holy name through me.  
  
Rushing wind blow through this temple,  
Blowing out the dust within,  
Come and breathe you breath upon me,  
For I've been born again.

So many times I've tried to tell you  
But I don't think you've been listening  
There's nothing I wanna try and sell you  
'Cause His love is free  
  
You're so proud of saying you're a seeker  
But why are you searching in the dark  
You won't find a thing  
Until you soften your heart  
  
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la  
  
The message is oh so very simple  
You gotta be like a child to see  
'Cause Jesus said "Let the little children  
Come unto Me"  
  
You try to make things to complicated  
But you really don't have to be so smart  
You don't learn a thing  
Until you soften your heart  
  
La-la-la-la  
La-la-la-la  
  
Well if this just this once  
I could show you your empty life  
I know you would follow Him right now  
  
Well I know it sounds  
Just too good to be true  
But if He Lives in you  
  
[Chorus]  
You'll never die,  
You'll never die,  
You'll live forever  
You'll never die,  
You'll never die,  
Take care of forever now  
  
You tell everyone to keep on smiling  
Your outlook on life is so positive  
But deep down inside  
You're searching for a reason to live  
  
Like everyone else you're scared of dying  
But the power of death has been blown apart  
And you'll live forever  
If you soften your heart  
  
[Chorus]

We are like windows  
Stained with colors of the rainbow  
Set in a darkened room  
Till the bridegroom comes to shining through  
  
Then the colors fall around our feet  
Over those we meet  
Covering all the gray that we see  
Rainbow colors of assorted hues  
Come exchange your blues  
For His love that you see shining through me  
  
We are His daughters and sons  
We are the colorful ones  
We are the kids of the King  
Rejoice in everything  
  
My colors grow so dim  
When I start to fall away from Him  
But up comes the strongest wind  
That he sends to blow me back into his arms again  
  
And then the colors fall around my feet  
Over those I meet  
Changing all the gray that I see  
Rainbow colors of the Risen Son  
Reflect the One  
The One who came to set us all free  
  
We are His daughters and sons  
We are the colorful ones  
We are the kids of the King  
Rejoice in everything  
  
We are like windows  
Stained with colors of the rainbow  
No longer set in a darkened room  
Cause the bridegroom wants to shine from you  
  
No longer set in a darkened room  
Cause the bridegroom wants to shine from you

Unexpectedly, you came back to see,  
If Id was waiting, like I promised long before.  
Your shadow filled the room, the music changed its tune,  
When I saw you, you were standing at the door.  
  
Like summer snow, you were an unexpected sight.  
A blazing sun, you were shining in the night,  
When I really should have known, that youd be coming home.  
I waited patiently, but I found it hard to see,  
  
If you were coming, why was there such a long delay.  
At times I thought you lied, or else you would have tried,  
To let me know that you were coming home today.  
Like summer snow, it falls around me in the cold.  
  
I can hear the echoes, of the warnings I was told.  
That I should know, that youd be coming home.  
Like summer snow, you were an unexpected sight.  
A blazing sun, you were shining in the night,  
  
When I really should have known, that youd be coming home.  
Unexpectedly, you came back to see...

The lord is my sheperd I shall not want  
He makes me lie down in green pastures.  
He leads me beside the still waters.  
He restoreth my soul  
And guides my path in righteousness  
For his name's sake.  
  
Surely goodness and loving kindness  
Shall follow me al the days of my life.  
And I will dwell in the house of the lord  
Forever and ever and ever.  
  
Though I walk through the valley  
Of the shadow of death  
I will not fear, thou art with me.  
Thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.  
Thou preparest a table  
Before me in the presence of my enemies.  
  
Thou anointest my head with oil  
My cup's overflowing  
  
Surely goodness and loving kindness  
Shall follow me al the days of my life.  
And I will dwell in the house of the lord  
Forever and ever and ever.

I was done hoeing, out in the fields for the day,  
I was thinking of going, I had to leave right away,  
My life is just fading, and oh I felt so alone,  
The nearest young maiden was, a full day's ride from home.  
  
My father was reading, the holy books in his room,  
My heart was just bleeding, I knew I had to go soon,  
He smiled and pointed at an old wooden chair,  
I wanted to hold him, but then I just wouldn't dare.  
  
I said, father, there's so much to know,  
There's a world of things to see,  
And I'm ready to go and make a life for myself  
If you give me what is mine,  
I will go, if I can have your blessing,  
But if you won't bless my journey, I'm gonna leave anyway.  
Son, I've always tried my best for you,  
And if you must be leaving home, then go with the blessing of God.  
  
Not too many days later, I was well on my way,  
I met a travelling stranger, who seemed to have much to say,  
He told me tales of the city, and all the women he'd had,  
I asked him, wasn't that sinful,  
He said, no, it isn't that bad.  
And then a few days later, on an old city road,  
We were drowning in laughter, and we had women to hold,  
And this went on quite a long time, my father gave me a lot,  
But when my pockets were empty, my friends all left me to rot.  
  
Then a famine hit and drained the land,  
Everywhere I looked I saw starvation, and a job was so hard to find,  
I wandered through the city streets, competing for the food of common beggers,  
Until then I'd never known hunger, but now I wasn't too proud.  
I finally found some employment, feeding pigs on a farm,  
I wasn't treated to kindly, I had to sleep in the barn,  
I had to eat with the swine,  
The bread I ate was like stone,  
It didn't take too much time until, I was dreaming of home.  
Oh, the servants there are better fed,  
If I could only have what my father gives them,  
I would truly need nothing more.  
Oh, I will go and say to him,  
I'm no longer worthy to be in your family,  
Will you take me as your servant, and let me live with them.  
  
It didn't take too long to pack my things,  
I left with only what I wore,  
As I prayed that I still had a home.  
I was near home, in site of the house,  
My father just stared, dropped open his mouth,  
He ran up the road, and fell to my feet, and cried, and cried,  
Father I've sinned, heaven ashamed,  
I'm no longer worthy to wear your name,  
I've learned that my home is right where you are,  
Oh father, take me in.  
Bring the best robe, put it on my son,  
Shoes for his feet, hurry put them on,  
This is my son who I thought had died,  
Prepare a feast for my son's alive,  
I've prayed and prayed, never heard a sound,  
My son was lost, oh thank you God he's found,  
My son was dead and he's now alive,  
Prepare a feast for my son's alive,  
My son was dead,  
My son was lost,  
My son's returned in the hands of God.

Well I though I depended upon you.  
At least that used to be what was happening with me.  
In those times of our first sweet communion,  
Nothing got in the way, I heard your voice everyday.  
When I first trusted you, gave my life to you.  
When I trusted you.  
  
Well there's something that needs to be cleared up.  
I feel so sorry inside, that my first love has died.  
Cause I've tried in my own strength to follow.  
When I've known all along, I just couldn't go wrong.  
If I'd only trusted you, give my life to you.  
If I'd trusted you. ooh, trusted you.  
  
Well I though I depended upon you.  
At least that used to be what was happening with me.  
In those times of our first sweet communion,  
Nothing got in the way, I heard your voice everyday.  
When I first trusted you, I gave my life to you.  
When I trusted you.

Take some time, make a friend of a stranger,  
Touch a hand, just reach out, there's no danger.  
When there's love mountains move,  
The blind can see and things improve.  
Don't be afraid to take the lead,  
And be the first to plant a seed,  
And then just watch it grow, don't you know?  
  
Take some time, tell someone that you love them,  
Make them feel there's a rainbow above them.  
When there's love storms will cease,  
And those in chains will be released.  
There's not a thing that love can't do,  
But it's got to start with me and you,  
And then just watch it grow, don't you know?  
  
When there's love, you can't lose,  
You'll always know which road to choose,  
There's not one thing that love can't do,  
But it's got to start with me and you.  
And then just watch it grow, don't you know?  
  
Take some time, make a friend of a stranger,  
When there's love touch a hand,  
Just reach out, there's no danger.  
When there's love, take some time,  
Make a friend of a stranger.  
When there's love, touch a hand,  
Just reach out, there's no danger.  
When there's love, take the time,  
Make a friend of a stranger.

You  
Who made the whole world with your hand  
Walked along this land  
Humbled as a man  
You came down  
and you changing the water to wine  
Gave your greatest sign  
By changing lives like mine  
How did You know  
I'd eventually go  
And take you for the Lord of my life?  
I'm so glad for  
  
You  
How did you stand the shame  
When they laughed at your name  
Your Father felt such pain  
Well how'd you take it  
  
But You  
Spoke not a word to defend  
Cause they'd see in the end  
When you rose again  
  
Whenever you spoke  
All the demons awoke  
And would tremble with fear at your sight  
  
And you  
Loving a world filled with hate  
And though the hour is late  
You still chose to wait  
But it won't be long until  
  
You  
Take the whole world by surprise  
They won't believe their eyes  
When You come through the skies  
When You return  
All the foolish will learn  
That they waited too long to decide  
  
Don't wait too long to decide

How I love you,  
You are the one,  
You are the one.  
How I love you,  
You are the one for me.  
  
I was so lost,  
But you showed the way,  
'Cause you are the way.  
I was so lost,  
But you showed the way to me.  
  
How I love you,  
You are the one,  
You are the one.  
How I love you,  
You are the one for me.  
  
I was lied to,  
But you told the truth,  
'Cause you are the truth.  
I was lied to,  
But you showed the truth to me.  
  
How I love you,  
You are the one,  
You are the one.  
How I love you,  
You are the one for me.  
  
I was dying,  
But you gave me life,  
'Cause you are the life.  
I was dying,  
And you gave your life for me.  
  
How I love you,  
You are the one,  
You are the one.  
How I love you,  
You are the one,  
God's risen Son,  
You are the one for me.  
  
Hallelujah,  
You are the one,  
You are the one.  
Hallelujah,  
You are the one for me.  
  
How I love you,  
You are the one,  
You are the one.  
How I love you,  
You are the one for me.

I want you here with Me  
But you've been keeping other company  
You can't sit still, it's plain to see  
You love the world and you're avoiding Me  
  
You love the world, avoiding Me  
  
My Word sits there upon your desk  
But you love your books and magazines the best  
You prefer the light of your TV  
You love the world and you're avoiding Me  
  
You used to pray, you were so brave  
Now you can't keep even one appointment we've made  
Oh, I gave My blood, to save your life  
Tell Me, tell Me is it right? Tell Me  
Will you leave Me here alone again tonight?  
  
Well, I love you, still more and more  
But you're fighting everything I'm working for  
You're acting like My enemy  
You love the world and you're avoiding Me  
  
You love the world, you know you love the world  
You love the world, avoiding Me  
  
These other loves, they're hurting you  
If you end up losing Me, then what will you do?  
Oh, I gave My blood, to save your life  
Tell Me, tell Me is it right? Tell Me  
Will you leave Me here alone again tonight?  
  
Well, I want you here with Me  
But you've been keeping other company  
And you prefer the light of your TV  
You love the world and you're avoiding Me  
  
You love the world, you love the world  
You love the world and you're avoiding Me  
You love the world  
You love the world, you're avoiding Me

I found it hard to believe  
Someone like you cared for me  
You put this love in my heart  
  
I tried but could not refuse  
You gave me no time to choose  
You put this love in my heart  
  
I want to know where the bad feelings go  
When I'm depressed and I get down so low  
And then I see you coming to me and it's alright  
  
I want to tell you right now  
I'm not afraid to say how  
You put this love in my heart  
  
There are sometimes when I doubt  
But you always find me out  
You put this love in my heart  
  
Cause when I see all that you've done for me  
It's hard to doubt, I just have to believe  
Cause you followed and proved it all of your life  
  
Well I know  
the loneliness I had before  
Is gone now  
I'll never feel it anymore  
  
Cause your love has released me  
From all that's in my past  
And I know I can believe you  
When you say I'll never be forsaken  
Your love is gonna last  
  
There's so much more I should say  
If I could just find a way  
You put this love in my heart  
  
Is all this real or a dream  
I feel so good I could scream  
You put this love in my heart  
  
I want to know where the bad feelings go  
When I'm depressed and I get down so low  
And then I see you coming to me and it's alright  
  
You put this love in my heart  
  
You put this love in my heart  
  
You put this love in my heart
