A song I heard the ocean sing  
A shining light in darkness deep  
I prayed a prayer into the tide  
And both they soothed me in my sleep  
  
For every season that has passed  
I prayed a prayer into the tide  
A shining light in darkness deep  
In my ten years before the mast  
  
For every season that has passed  
I laid my body o'er the side  
A shining light in darkness deep  
I prayed a prayer into the tide  
  
How can I answer questions I've known?  
How can I answer questions I've known?  
How can I answer questions I've known?  
How can I answer questions I've known?  
  
A song I heard the ocean sing  
A shining light in darkness deep  
Ten years before the mast  
I heard the ocean sing

The first time I came over I was bitten by your dog  
You weren't even there 'cause you were walking in the fog  
I call you up and plead and beg and talk to your machine  
My friends say not to bother when you're acting pretty mean  
  
But I don't need to bother you, no I won't play that part  
I just want access to the inside of your heart  
Access to your thoughts on the way that I should be  
So I could start to change and maybe you could access me  
  
Access me, access me  
  
You could tell me all about all the things you did at work  
The guy who sits beside you and how he's acting like a jerk  
And you don't have to open up the secrets of your soul  
But if that's the place you want me I'd be glad to pay the toll  
  
But I don't need to bother you, no I won't play that part  
I just want access to the inside of your heart  
Access to your thoughts on the way that I should be  
So I could start to change and maybe you could access me  
  
Access me

There is a place on the mountain near by  
Deep in a cave but its up rather high  
There in the darkness I safely concealed  
All of the dreams that you never revealed  
  
And if you go there, and after you do  
All of these dreams would be yours to pursue  
The rest of your lifetime, devoid of a care  
If you keep your eyes open, you may find yourself there  
  
Such is the promise, such is the curse  
You could just live your life better or worse  
Knowing the casual dreams up on that hill  
Beckons and sways but won't bend to your will  
  
You might find a river under a mountain that  
Feeds a remote, subterranean fountain  
Drink from this taste just a hint of a dream  
That some how leads in to the underground stream  
  
And if you go there, and after you do  
All of these dreams would be yours to pursue  
The rest of your lifetime, devoid of a care  
If you keep your eyes open, you may find yourself there  
  
If you keep your heart open

Woke up this morning and I had those Walking Blues (x2)  
I wasn't walkin' nowhere 'cause I didn't have no floor!  
  
Staring over the edge of the bed  
My old lady lying next to me, I started to cry (x2)  
She said "I'm gonna take this diploma,  
I'm gonna slice you in the eye!"  
  
Well I'm alright (he's alright) (x9)  
'cause I got a degree!  
  
Escaping through my window  
There's a policeman on the lawn outside my home (x2)  
I opened my mouth to scream but my throat was full of foam  
  
So I'm sittin' in this cell  
My fortune dwindled to a thimble full of filth (x2)  
I may spend the rest of my life in jail but at least it's got a floor!  
  
Chorus  
  

I am just a satellite, high above the atmosphere  
Bouncing every thing you say to someone who is meant to hear  
Sometimes on a rainy day, I lie in bed and dream of you  
So blame it on the satellite, when your message can't get through  
  
I am just a tiny wave, a minor ripple out at sea  
Moving slowly towards the shore, burdened with uncertainty  
I'm gaining power, losing speed, wondering as I near your door  
Will you hold it open for the tidal wave approaching shore?  
  
You've become an island in the hazy world surrounding me  
Offering a vast reward each time I safely cross the sea  
All too often I become lost in the fog and haze  
Clinging still, against my will, to promises of clearer days  
  
I am just a raindrop that accelerates without control  
Losing bits and pieces in descent 'til I'm no longer whole  
I am just another shooting star above that you might see  
Until I have your full attention I'll be anything but me  
Anything but me

Northern dilemma, call of the cold  
The arms of the arctic begin to unfold  
Sit in a circle facing the sun  
Get what you can now, winter is on  
  
Truth on condition, never dig deep  
Solemn reminders as groundwaters seep  
Into foundations, centers of joy  
To weaken and crumble, search and destroy  
  
Light up the city, hiding so strange  
You'd better take cover, it's love at close range  
Oh solo mission, cover of dark  
Army of one now, don't let down your guard  
  
Sit in a circle facing the sun  
Soak it in while you can, winter is on  
I got no answer but you've got no call  
I just can't compete with the weight of it all  
  
Silent treatment, stone in the rain  
Bright, shining doorway, try to remain  
Northern dilemma, call of the cold  
The arms of the arctic begin to unfold  
  
Sit in a circle facing the sun  
Soak it in while you can, winter is on  
I got no answer but you've got no call  
I just can't compete with the weight of it all

Summer sitting out by the pool  
A ray of sunlight getting in my way  
Close your eyes and wish that it were cool  
Everyday  
  
And I wish it could be back the other way  
But what's dissolved ain't coming back today  
Close your eyes and wish that it were  
Close your eyes and wish that it were  
  
Axilla axilla axilla axilla  
  
Never understood what my body was for  
That's why I always leave it layin out on the floor  
The shape a curiosity  
Where different faces fit before  
  
And tracing my image in the sand  
To pass the time from slip to fall  
The line I trace begins to weave  
A tangled web from wall to wall

When I jumped off, I had a bucket full of thoughts  
When I first jumped off, I held that bucket in my hand  
Ideas that would take me all around the world  
I stood and watched the smoke behind the mountain curl  
It took me a long time to get back on the train  
  
Now I'm gone and I'll never look back again  
I'm gone and I'll never look back at all  
You know I'll never look back again  
I turn my face into the howlin' wind  
It took me a long time to get back on the train  
  
See my face in the town that's flashing by  
See me standing at the station in the rain  
See me running there beside the car  
I left it all behind, again I'll travel far  
It took me a long time to get back on the train  
  
When I jumped off, I had a bucket full of thoughts  
When I first jumped off, I held that bucket in my hand  
Ideas that would take me all around the world  
I stood and watched the smoke behind the mountains curl  
It took me a long time to get back on the train  
It took me a long time to get back on the train  
It took me a long time to get back on the train

Brett is in the bathtub  
Making soup for the ambassadors  
And I am in the hallway  
Singing to the troubadours  
  
The kings are all lined up  
Outside the gate  
And the autumn bells are ringing  
But they'll just have to wait  
  
Where is the joker?  
Have you seen him around  
With his three coned cap  
That he wears like a clown?  
  
Have you seen his stripped stockings  
And heard his sad tale  
About the kids under the carpet  
And the purple humpbacked whales  
  
Here come the ambassadors  
They show up one by one  
Brett is tasting all the soup  
To see if it is done  
  
Wendy's on the windowsill  
Waiting to be let in  
And we're all in the bathtub now  
Making bathtub gin  
  
The kings storm the hallway  
They've climbed up through the gate  
They didn't mean to be impolite  
But they just couldn't wait  
  
Here comes the joker  
With his silly grin  
He carries a martini  
Made of bathtub gin  
  
Here comes the joker  
We all must laugh  
Cause we're all in this together  
And we love to take a bath.

When I get home from work, what do I do?  
I try to kill you  
When I get home from work, what do I do?  
I try to kill you  
And why would I try to kill you?  
Because you're a  
Big black furry creature from Mars  
Big black furry creature from Mars

When we go out to eat, what do I do?

Oh, I am killing you  
Now why would I go and do that?  
Because you're a

I'm runnin', I'm runnin' from you  
I'm runnin', I'm runnin'  
And what causes me to run?  
'Cause you're a

Big black furry creature from Mars  
Big black furry creature from Mars  
Big black furry creature from Mars

It's easy sometimes when you just coast along  
But like it or not something always seems to go wrong  
Sometimes people build you up just so they can knock you down  
Sometimes they will have you there 'cause they need someone around  
  
Perhaps you'll receive invitations for tea  
Perhaps you'll laugh and make them all smile  
Or maybe you'll join them 'cause it had to be  
Perhaps you'll forget you forgot for awhile  
  
Birds of a feather are flocking outside  
Like whippets they dance in a curly-queue dance  
Of pulses and ringing and campfire chants  
Of ritual drumming although at first glance  
You thought you could run but you won't take a chance  
  
It's not an experience if they can't bring someone along  
They hang on emotions they bottle inside  
They peck at the ground  
And strut out of stride

She's bitchin' again  
She's bitchin' again  
She's bitchin' again drivin' me crazy  
  
She's bitchin' again  
She's bitchin' again  
She's bitchin' again drivin' me nuts  
  
"I thought you said  
You'd bring home the groceries  
I thought you said you'd fill up the tank  
I thought you said you'd pull out for me  
A hundred-fifty dollars from the bank"  
  
She's bitchin' again  
She's bitchin' again  
She's bitchin' again drivin' me crazy  
  
She's bitchin' again  
She's bitchin' again  
She's bitchin' again drivin' me crazy  
  
She's bitchin' again  
She's bitchin' again  
She's bitchin' again drivin' me nuts  
  
"I thought you said  
You'd bring me some flowers  
You came home with nothing  
You dirty rat fink  
I thought you said you'd  
Clean up the living room  
You said you'd do the dishes in the sink"  
  
"I'm sick and tired of your childish behavior  
You're always coming home completely soused  
I'm sick and tired of this shoebox apartment  
When are you going to buy me a house? "  
  
She's bitchin' again  
She's bitchin' again  
She's bitchin' again drivin' me crazy  
  
She's bitchin' again  
She's bitchin' again  
She's bitchin' again drivin' me nuts  
  
She's bitchin' again

She's bitchin' again drivin' me crazy  
  
She's bitchin' again  
She's bitchin' again  
She's bitchin' again drivin' me nuts

When the only tool you have is a hammer  
Everything looks like a nail  
And you're living at the Bittersweet Motel  
When the only tool you have is a hammer  
Everything looks like a nail  
And you're living at the Bittersweet Motel  
Halfway between Erie and Pittsburgh  
You put me through hell  
On the highway to the Bittersweet Motel  
Halfway between Erie and Pittsburgh  
You put me through hell  
On the highway to the Bittersweet Motel  
When the only tool you have is a hammer  
Everything looks like a nail  
And you're living at the Bittersweet Motel  

The lonesome sound of the train goin' by  
Makes me want to stop and cry  
I recall the day  
It took you away  
I'm blue and I'm lonesome too  
  
Well, when I hear that whistle blow  
Well I want to pack my suitcase and go  
The lonesome sound of the train goin' by  
Makes me want to stop and cry  
  
(Instrumental solo)  
  
In the still of the night and pale moonlight  
The wind blows and cry  
These lonesome blues  
I just can't loose  
I'm blue and I'm lonesome too  
  
Well when I hear that whistle blow  
Well I want to pack my suitcase and go  
The lonesome sound of the train goin' by  
Makes me want to stop and cry  
  
These lonesome blues  
I just can't loose  
I'm blue and I'm lonesome too  
I'm blue and I'm lonesome too

Till you holla for more

Under the stars above

Boogie on reggae woman  
Let me do it to you  
Boogie on reggae woman

The woman was a dream I had  
Though rather hard to keep  
For when my eyes were watching hers, they closed, and I was still asleep  
  
For when my hand was holding hers  
She whispered words and I awoke  
  
And faintly bouncing round the room  
The echo of whomever spoke  
And I awoke, and faintly bouncing round the room  
The echo of whomever spoke  
  
The place I sought was far beneath, the surface of the sea  
My sight was poor, but I was sure  
The sirens sang their song for me  
  
They dance above me as I sink  
I see them through a crystal haze  
And hear the sweet sound bouncing round  
The never-ending coral maze,  
The crystal haze,  
And hear the bouncing round the room  
The never-ending coral maze  
  
Then before and now once more, I'm bouncing round the room  
That time then and once again, I'm bouncing round the room  
That time then and once again, I'm bouncing round the room  
That time then and once again, I'm bouncing round the room  
That time then and once again, I'm bouncing round the room, (cont)  
  
And I awoke, faintly bouncing round the room  
The echo of whomever spoke  
And I awoke, faintly bouncing round the room  
The echo of whomever spoke  
And I awoke, faintly bouncing round the room  
The echo of whomever spoke

There have been times that I wander  
And times that I don't  
Concepts I'll ponder  
And concepts I won't ever see  
God is not one of these  
Former or latter  
Which did you think I meant  
It doesn't matter to me  
  
Bug  
It doesn't matter  
(Don't need it)  
Bug  
It doesn't matter  
(Don't need it)  
Bug  
It doesn't matter  
(Overrated)  
Overrated  
  
Gold in my hand  
In a country pool  
Standing and waving  
The rain, wind on the runway  
Spending or saving  
Credit or debt  
Which did you think I meant  
Nothing I see can be taken from me

I saw you with Carini and that piece of ass  
You built your house with windows but those windows had no glass  
Lucy had a lumpy head, Lucy took a walk, now Lucy's dead  
  
You told me of a secret place  
I saw it when I met you, the war is on your face  
Aghilla (Carini) scared the shit out of the ram  
  
The thesis that you're writing is a load of shit  
But I'm glad you finally finished it  
You went across the street and he called his dad  
Now you'll never get the raise you thought you had  
  
If all was screaming when they saw the lump  
Everyone was screaming when they saw the lump  
Aghilla (Carini) scared the shit out of the ram  
  
Carini had a lumpy head  
Carini had a lumpy head  
Carini had a lumpy head  
Carini had a lumpy head

Nothing could be finer  
Than to be in Carolina in the morning  
No one could be sweeter than my sweetie  
When I meet her in the morning  
Where the morning glories twine around the door  
Whispering pretty stories, I long to hear once more  
Strolling with my girlie  
Where the dew is pearly early in the morning  
Butterflies all flutter up and kiss each little buttercup at dawning  
If I had Aladdin's lamp for only a day  
I'd make a wish and here's what I'd say  
Nothing could be finer than to be in Carolina in the morning  
Where the morning glories twine around the door  
Whispering pretty stories I long to hear once more  
Strolling with my girlie  
Where the dew is pearly early in the morning  
Butterflies all flutter up and kiss each little buttercup at dawning  
If I had Aladdin's lamp for only a day  
I'd make a wish and here's what I'd say  
Nothing could be finer than to be in Carolina in the morning  

(Doctor Davis, telephone please...Doctor Davis, telephone please)  
  
I'd catapult downtown  
To see the galleries  
And my favorite fiancee  
In a lavender gown  
  
But I'm hooked up to a machine  
It performs my daily functions  
Through a tube in my wien  
  
And today that thing malfunctioned  
Like a forest fire  
It burnt a hole in me and I perspired  
  
So there ain't gonna be a wedding  
No love affair  
No art to which none compares

Your time is near, the mission's clear  
It's later than we think  
Before you slip into the night  
You'll want something to drink  
Steal away before the dawn, and  
Bring us back good news  
But if you've tread in primal soup  
Please wipe it from your shoes  
  
Just then a porthole pirate  
Scourged the evening with his cry  
And sanctuary bugs deprived  
The monkey of its thigh  
A dust arose and clogged my nose  
Before I could blink twice  
Despite the stuff that bubbled up  
I gave some last advice:  
  
The flesh from Satan's dogs  
Will make the rudiments of gruel  
  
Deduct the carrots from your pay  
You worthless swampy fool  
  
Exploding then through fields and fen  
And swimming in the mire  
The septic maiden's gargoyle tooth  
Demented me with fire  
I drifted where the current chose  
Afloat upon my back  
And if perchance a newt slimed by  
I'd stuff it in my sack  
  
Soon I felt a bubble form, Somewhere below my skin  
But with handy spine of hedgehog  
I removed the force within  
Suzie then removed her mask  
And caused a mighty stir  
The angry mob responded  
Taking turns at grabbing her  
  
The foggy cavern's musty grime  
Appeared within my palm  
I snatched Rick's fork to scrape it off  
With deadly icy calm  
  
The brothel wife then grabbed a knife  
And slashed me on the tongue  
I turned the blade back on the bitch  
And dropped her in the dung]  
  
The crowd meanwhile had taken Sue  
And used her like a rag  
To mop the slime from where the slug  
Had slithered with the bag  
  
In summing up, the moral seems  
A little bit obscure...  
  
Give the director a serpent deflector  
A mudrat detector, a ribbon reflector  
A cushion convector, a picture of nectar  
A virile dissector,a hormone collector  
  
Whatever you do take care of your shoes

Come stumble my mirth beaten worker  
I'm Jezmund the family berzerker  
I'm bought for the price of a flagon of rice  
The wind buffs the cabin  
You speak of your life  
Or more willingly Locust the Lurker  
  
Confuse what you can of the ending  
And revise your despise so impending  
'Cause I soak on the wrath  
That you didn't quite mask  
I'm getting it clearly through alternate paths  
Or mixed in with the signal you're sending  
  
But who can unlearn all the facts that I've learned  
As I sat in their chairs and my synapses burned  
And the torture of chalk dust collects on my tongue  
Thoughts follow my vision and dance in the sun  
All my vasoconstrictors they come slowly undone  
Cant this wait till I'm old?  
Can't I live while I'm young?  
  
But no peace for Jezmund tonight  
I plug the distress tube up tight  
And watch what I say as it flutters away  
And all this emotion is kept harmless at bay  
Not to educate somebody's fright

Think of London, small city  
Dark, dark in the daytime  
People sleep, sleep in the daytime  
If they want to, if they want to  
  
I'm checkin' 'em out  
I'm checkin' 'em out  
I've got it figured out  
I've got it figured out  
  
There's some good points, some bad points  
But it all works out, I'm just a little freaked out  
  
Find your city,  
Find yourself a city to live in  
I will find a city,  
Find yourself a city to live in  
  
A lot of bridges in Birmingham  
A lot of ghosts, and a lot of houses  
Look over there, dry ice factory  
Good place to get some thinking done  
  
I'm checkin' 'em out  
I'm checkin' 'em out  
I've got it figured out  
I'm the one who got it figured out  
  
There's some good points, some bad points  
  
Find your city,  
Find yourself a city to live in  
I will find a city,  
Find yourself a city to live in  
  
Did I forget to mention,  
Forget to mention Memphish  
Home of Elvis and the ancient Greeks  
Do I smell, I smell home cooking  
It's only the river, it's only the river  
  
I'm checkin' 'em out  
I'm checkin' 'em out  
I've got it figured out  
I've got it figured out  
  
There's some good points, some bad points  
Are those things real? Denied!  
  
Find your city,  
Find yourself a city to live in  
I will find a city,  
Find yourself a city to live in  
I will find a city,  
Find yourself a city to live in  
I will find a city  
Find yourself a city to live in

Colonel Forbin stared up at the mountain  
And wiped away the beads of sweat  
That glistened on his brow  
His tired feet were buried in the quagmire  
And his bloodshot eyes saw all that lay between him  
And fulfillment of his vow  
  
And he felt his fingers wrap around a knotted root  
And pulled his body upwards  
To a sea green mossy boulder  
And he dragged his weary carcass [or "shit-ass"] up the mountain  
  
And he climbed so slowly  
He climbed so slowly  
Ahead  
Ahead  
  
Suddenly he heard the crack of thunder  
And the rocks began to crumble overhead  
And tumble down the mountain to the  
Dismal swamp that lay beneath the jagged cliffs  
through which his path had led  
And the earth began to quake beneath his feet  
And the mighty mountain changed before his eyes  
And he stood amidst a sea of dust and rocks and stones  
Cascading down the mountain  
And a thousand birds were headed for the sky. Oh...  
  
The sacred creed will be yours  
And if you wait until tomorrow  
The sacred creed will be yours  
To devour  
Yours  
To seize  
And to obey  
Obey  
  
When the dust had cleared, the colonel lifted up his head  
And was driven to his knees by a blazing beam of light  
And he saw the silhouette that stood before him  
And he bowed in reverence  
Trembling in the shadow of the mighty legend's form  
Icculus the prophet stood before his eyes  
Looking down on Colonel Forbin  
Where he shuddered in the puddles and the muck  
And he quietly addressed him  
  
And he spoke so slowly  
He spoke so slowly  
Ahead  
He said  
  
Colonel Forbin I know why you've come here  
And I'll help you with your quest to gain the knowledge that you lack  
I call upon my faithful friend the mockingbird  
To fly and seize the helping book and bring it to your shack  
And a tree of knowledge in your soul will grow  
And the Helping Friendly Book will plant the seed  
But I warn you that all knowledge seeming innocent and pure  
Becomes a deadly weapon in the hands of avarice  
And greed  
  
The sacred greed will be yours  
And if you wait until tomorrow  
The sacred creed will be yours  
To devour  
Yours  
To seize  
And to obey  
And to obey  
  
  
And the famous mockingbird swooped down out of the sky and landed on  
Icculus's shoulder, and Icculus whispered into the bird's ear, and it flew  
off toward Wilson's castle in the valley below.

shot into high gear. He snatched up the book with one hand and the famous

The tires are the things on your car  
That make contact with the road  
The car is the thing on the road  
That takes you back to your abode  
  
The tires are the things on your car  
That make contact with the road  
Bummed is what you are  
When you go out to your car and it's been towed  
  
I woke up one morning in November  
And I realized I love you  
It's not your headlights in front  
Your tailpipe, or the skylight above you  
It's the way you cling to the road  
When the wind tries to shove you  
I'd never go riding away  
And come back home without you

Bigger than man walking on the moon  
Coming to a theatre near you soon  
This is what I'm living for  
You get a little bit  
And you want a little more  
  
Everything is fine  
Crimes of the mind  
I drink a little wine  
Crimes of the mind  
Here's to modern times  
Crimes of the mind  
  
Every dog will have it's day  
And all these dogs just want to play  
You will reap what you sow  
But the real truth we will never know  
  
Everything is fine  
Crimes of the mind  
I drink a little wine  
Crimes of the mind  
Here's to modern times  
Crimes of the mind  
  
Rolling in the grime  
Crimes of the mind  
Digging for a dime  
Crimes of the mind  
Blind leading the blind  
Crimes of the mind

You may as well keep your belly full  
For the time may come when you'll rely on the layer of fat  
That separates you from the rabid dog and the common fly  
To a less demanding place on your spine  
I feel you shift my weight around  
I squirm and roll beneath your flesh  
Just like the guy you met in town  
  
He's yelling at the parking lot  
Throwing beer cans down the stairs  
Driving home to Mom and Dad  
To spend a weekend with no cares

Highway Bill's on the rotary still and he can't even feel the painof a sun
dried shoulder and a scar from a boulderthat cut him right across his veinnow
he's suckin' cigar and he's shovelin' tarin the crater of a turnpike
terrainhe's got only one hope, and he wants to elope, 'cuz Highway Jill is
driving him insane.  
  
We gotta get on the road, destiny unboundshe's the one for me we gotta get
outta townwe gotta get on the road, destiny unboundshe's the one for me we
gotta get outta townhighway Jill was a daffodil with a cactus sense of prideat
the wheel of a tractor, she was quite an impactorwhen the road rocks started
to slideshe saw Bill drop his shovel on a pile of gravelas he climbed up out
of his ditchshe was wonderstruck when he climbed in her truckhe said "I've
been havin' this everlasting itch  
  
Chorus  
  
At first she was cold, she was ready to scoldthis guy from the pit with a
thing in his headbut then she thought twice when he melted her icewith his
passionate eyes she was energized! She started the ignition and without
permissionthe two of 'em flew down the dusty roadbut the road wasn't finished
and the pavement diminishedthey soared off the edge and they plunged in the
sludge  
  
She said: There isn't even any road, our Destiny was boundwe were the ones for
us but now we're in the ground(4x)

Washed up on shore  
Washed up on shore  
  
I'd like to live beneath the dirt  
A tiny space to move and breathe is all that I would ever need  
I want to live beneath the dirt  
Where I'd be free from push and shove like all those swarming up above  
Beneath your heals I'll spend my time  
  
Shout your name into the wind  
I'll wiggle in the earth and dew  
Shout your name into the wind  
And sometimes I will think of you  
Shout your name into the wind  
And if you ever think of me  
Kneel down and kiss the earth  
And show me what this thought is worth  
I'll never hear your voice again  
  
Shout your name into the wind  
Shout your name into the wind  
Shout your name into the wind  
Shout your name into the wind  
  
Shout your name into the wind  
Shout your name into the wind  
Shout your name into the wind  
Shout your name into the wind

The sound of flying swiftly, which makes it hard to find  
Pathway through the darkness, every time I fall behind  
I think I hear a whisper, around nearly every turn  
But what the voice is saying, I barely can discern  
The echoes that are following the contours of the ground  
Ebb and flow and eddies in, a title wave of sound  
And through the mist I think I see your face and try to learn  
The meanings of expressions, I barely can discern  
And through the mist I think I see your face and try to learn  
The meaning of expressions I barely can discern  
The echoes that are following the contours of the ground  
Evan flow and at lease in, a title wave of sound  
  
  
And through the mist, I think I see your face and try to learn  
The meaning the of expressions I barely can discern

I can't spare a moment for the dog faced boy  
I won't lend another hand to theworm girl of Hanoi  
Don't deplete my oxygen for the guy who's turning blue  
But ask me, and I'll do anything for you  
  
Whenever I think of you it only makes me feel sad  
Whenever I think of you, the best friend I ever had  
Before I gave it up all for nothing  
Well, I lied and I cheated  
  
And it made me feel bad  
It made me feel guilty for not being true  
Oh the months I spend trying for a way to explain  
In the end all I could do as turn my head in shame  
Whenever I think of you it only makes me feel sad  
Because you deserve better and once I was it  
But somehow my good intentions just got up and git

Down with disease  
Three weeks in my bed  
Trying to stop these demons that keep dancing in my head  
  
Down with disease  
Up before the dawn  
A thousand barefoot children outside dancing on my lawn, and I keep  
  
Waiting for the time when I can finally say  
That this has all been wonderful but now I'm on my way  
But when I think it's time to leave it all behind  
I try to find a way but there's nothing I can say to make it stop  
  
Down with disease and the jungles in my mind  
They're climbing up my waterfalls and swingin' on my vines  
So I try to hear the music but I'm always losing time  
'Cause they're stepping on my rhythm and they're stealin' all my lines  
Stealin' all my lines and I keep  
  
Waiting for the time when I can finally say  
That this has all been wonderful but now I'm on my way  
But when I think it's time to leave it all behind  
I try to find a way but there's nothing I can say to make it stop

I'll tell you about the driver who lives inside my head  
Starts me up and stops me and puts me into bed  
He opens up my mouth when it's time for me to talk  
Fires up my legs when he wants me to walk  
Keeps my eyes open most of the day  
Adds to my memory the things that people say  
When he makes decisions I don't have to wait  
But sometimes it seems he's got to much on his plate  
Like this morning when I woke up and he dressed me in this shirt  
That looks a little ragged where he drug me through the dirt  
I'm moving through this life and I'm thinking about the next  
And hoping when I get there I'll be better dressed  
Keeps my eyes open for most of the day  
Adds to my memory the things that people say  
When he makes decisions I don't have to wait  
I'll tell you about the driver who lives inside my head  
  

There are men high up there fishing,  
Haven't seen quite enough of the world,  
I ain't seen a sign of my heroes,  
And I'm still diving down for pearls.  
  
Let me flow into the ocean,  
Let me get back to the sea.  
Let me be stormy and let me be calm,  
Let the tide in, and set me free.  
  
I'm flowing under bridges,  
Then flying through the sky,  
I'm travelling down cold metal  
Just a tear in baby's eye.  
  
Let me flow into the ocean  
Let me get back to the sea  
Let me be stormy and let me be calm  
Let the tide in, come set me free.  
  
I am not the actor  
This can't be the scene  
But I am in the water,  
As far as I can see  
  
I'm remembering distant memories  
Recalling other names.  
Rippling over canyons,  
And boiling in the train.  
  
Let me  
  
I wanna drown  
In cold water

It was late one fall night at a fairground near town  
When Esther first saw the Armenian man  
Who groveled toward her and stood by her side  
With a bucket that swung in his hand  
  
His grin stretched the folds of his pasty white cheeks  
And his lips hurled a dollop of murk on the curb  
And the lights from the rides showed a mischievous sparkle  
That flashed in his hollow eyed stare  
  
He said "Little girl, you can chop off my legs  
And then peel off my socks if you want to.  
But I'd rather you took this old puppet from me  
That I hold in my pail as we speak."  
  
And he stood looking down at the innocent girl  
And she stared at the bucket bewildered  
Til he lifted the doll for the young girl to see  
And a giant smile grew on his face  
She saw the doll's eyes and she couldn't resist  
And she thanked the man quickly and ran to the church  
And she burst through the door with puppet held high  
And a hush filled the chapel, and the people looked mean  
  
Esther tried in vain to pacify the mob  
Quibble grew to spat, to wrangle, then to brawl  
The frenzied congregation struggled desperately to fetch  
The pretty puppet snugly nestled deep in Esther's leather sack  
Through the window of the church a storm began to rage  
And Esther knew the time had come to flee  
  
She scurried down the aisle toward the doorway in the distance  
And out into the rainstorm where she felt she would be free  
But the wind was blowing harder  
And her skirt began to billow  
Until finally her feet began to lift  
  
And she rose above the people and the houses  
and the chimneys  
And Esther and the doll were set adrift  
Floating higher over the hills, and the valleys and treetops  
they'd flutter and glide  
Soaring and turning suspended on air  
With the earth far below them they'd tumble  
And dive through the clouds  
  
And she began to plummet earthward till she  
Landed in the nasty part of town  
  
She glanced about the village sure to find the evil men  
Who rob and pillage in the darkest hour of night  
Nervously she fumbled for the pouch that held the  
Puppet on her rump.  
  
Feeling quite outnumbered Esther hid behind  
A nearby pile of lumber, where she waited  
Till the dawn  
Cause it would have been a blunder to  
Succumb to a hoodlum on the prowl  
  
When the morning came, she wandered through the streets  
Along the chilly lake that lay beside the town  
At last a peaceful moment, but she thought she heard a sound  
It was an angry mob of joggers coming up to knock her down  
  
As Esther stood and shook her head  
The joggers were approaching  
And she knew she had no choice left but to swim  
As the frosty water sank its bitter teeth into her hide  
She tried to slide the heavy clothing from her skin  
  
Naked now she made her way toward the shore  
When suddenly she felt a tiny tugging at her toe.  
And the puppet she'd forgotten wrapped its tiny  
Little arms around her ankle and wouldn't let her go.  
  
The waves seemed to open and swallow her whole  
As the doll pulled her down through the eerie green deep  
And the sound of the laughing old man filled her ears  
As she drifted away to a tranquil  
And motionless sleep.

The next morning at the camp Errand Wolfe and Rutherford stood frozen in awe
as the famous mockingbird flew out of the sky and laid the Helping Friendly
Book at their feet. The quest for the book had dragged on for so many years
that it's sudden appearance left the men staring in disbelief, unsure of what
their next move should be. The shock wore off quickly though, and Errand Wolfe
shot into high gear. He snatched up the book with one hand and the famous
mockingbird with the other, and began to inform Rutherford of his plan. He
would first kill Wilson, and then put the Helping Friendly Book to work for
him.  
  
With Rutherford's aid he fastened the famous mockingbird to a pole, with glue
and rubber bands, to insure the secrecy of his mission, and then set out to
find the only man in Gamehendge who could handle the job of eliminating a
King.

Welcome, this is a farmhouse.  
We have cluster flies, alas.  
And this time of year is bad.  
  
We are so very sorry  
There is little we can do,  
But swat them  
  
She didn't beg, oh not enough.  
She didn't stay when things got rough.  
I told a lie and she got mad  
She wasn't there when things got bad  
  
I never ever saw the Northern Lights  
(This is a farmhouse)  
I never really heard of cluster flies  
(Cluster flies, alas)  
I never ever saw the stars so bright  
(This is a farmhouse)  
In the Farmhouse, it will be alright  
(Cluster flies, alas)  
  
Brought this one to the stinging lash  
Every man rise from the ash  
Each betrayal begins with trust  
Every man returns to dust  
  
I never ever saw the Northern Lights  
(This is a farmhouse)  
I never ever heard a cluster fly  
(Cluster flies, alas)  
I never ever saw the stars so bright  
(This is a farmhouse)  
In the promise that you'll be all right  
(Cluster flies, alas)

I crashed a  
Learned to keep my eye on you  
You always say you'll lead the way, but then you never do  
I slow a swerve but lost my nerve and quickly looked away  
When I looked back, the day was black  
Then I heard you say  
Why is the sun high, and why does it rain  
Why is there danger and why is there pain  
Why can't the burden be carried away  
And why isn't it Friday today  
  
Your lack of trust is hardly just  
So do as you've been told  
Please follow me into the sea  
Don't worry if its cold  
I knew right then my chance again  
Had quickly slipped away  
I crashed, I cried, I burned my eyes  
Ill follow anyway  
  
Why is the sea cold, why is it blue  
Why do I stay here, why is it you  
Notice the danger, don't help it anyway  
Why isn't it Friday today  
  
I knew right then my chance again  
Would quickly slip away  
I crash, I cry, I burn my eyes  
I still follow anyway

I'm a sailor's girl, the best is yet to come  
Rolling in my Fuego, I do my own stunts  
I see guilty people, angels blowing horns  
  
Some days it's just not worth gnawing through the straps  
Freak out and throw stuff, World's Greatest Dad  
Read a little book about Vlad the Impaler  
  
Whoa, oh  
Whoa, oh  
  
Inside your Fuego, we keep it rolling  
Inside your Fuego, we keep it rolling  
Inside your Fuego, we keep it rolling  
Inside your Fuego, we keep it rolling  
  
I asked Diego if it was stolen  
Inside your Fuego, we keep it rolling  
Rolling, rolling, rolling  
Diego, Diego, Diego

I feel I never told you  
The story of the ghost  
That I once knew and talked to  
Of whom I'd never boast  
  
For this was my big secret  
How I'd get ahead  
And never have to worry  
I'd call him instead  
  
His answer came in actions  
He never spoke a word  
Or maybe I laid down the phone  
Before he could be heard  
  
I somehow feel forsaken  
Like he had closed the door  
I guess I just stopped needing him  
As much as once before  
  
But maybe he's still with me  
The latch was left unhooked  
He's waiting in the wind and rain  
I simply haven't looked

Aboard a craft bereft of oar  
I rowed upstream to find Lenore  
Abducted by a bandit or  
A king from some forgotten war  
  
And mindful of his larval craze  
The rhinotropic micro-gaze  
Ignored it and to my amazement  
Rode to Paris in twelve days  
  
This is the work of the guelah papyrus  
Stranded for a moment on the ocean of Osyrus  
Absorbing all she can for every member of her clan  
Expanding exponentially like some recursive virus  
  
She take me on, I never fail  
To ride on the redundant rail  
'Cause when I know she's switched a track  
There's always one to take me back  
  
And through the bedroom door intrude  
A fretful frown and spoil the mood  
'Cause though I never really stand that tall  
She tilt my frame, she watch me fall  
  
So maybe I could be a fly  
And feed arachnid as I die  
And view the ritual from within  
The silken tunnel that they spin  
  
And through the bedroom door intrude  
A fretful frown and spoil the mood  
'Cause though I never really stand that tall  
She tilt my frame, she watch me fall

Things are falling down on me  
Heavy things I could not see  
When I finally came around  
Something small would pin me down  
When I tried to step aside  
I moved to where they hoped I'd be  
  
Vanessa calls me on the phone  
Reminding me I'm not alone  
I fuss and quake and cavitate  
I try to speak and turn to stone  
  
Telly reaches through my vest  
To do the thing that she does best  
She probes and tears my ventricles  
Steals my one remaining breath  
  
Things are falling down on me  
Heavy things I could not see  
When I finally came around  
Something small would pin me down  
When I tried to step aside  
I moved to where they hoped I'd be  
  
Stumbling as I fall from grace  
She needs my vision to replace  
Her ailing sight throughout the night  
Leaving two holes in my face  
  
Mary was a friend I'd say  
'Till one summer day  
She borrowed everything I owned  
And then simply ran away  
  
Things are falling down on me  
Heavy things I could not see  
When I finally came around  
Something small would pin me down  
When I tried to step inside  
I moved to where they hoped I'd be

Tell me that I'm your own, my baby  
Hello my baby, hello my honey  
Hello my ragtime, summertime gal  
Send me a kiss by wire, by wire  
Baby, my heart's on fire, on fire  
If you refuse me, honey, you lose me  
And you'll be left alone, oh baby  
Telephone, and tell me, tell me  
Tell me I'm your very own, oh  
  
Hello my baby, hello my honey  
Hello my ragtime, summertime gal

Then you'll be left alone, oh baby  
Telephone, and tell me, tell me

When a man is running from his boss  
Who holds a gun that fires cost  
And people die from being old  
Or left alone because they're cold  
And bombs are dropped on fighting cats  
And children's dreams are run with rats  
If you complain you disappear  
Just like the lesbians and queers  
No one can love without the grace  
Of some unseen and distant face  
And you get beaten up by blacks  
Who though they worked still got the sack  
And when your soul tells you to hide  
Your very right to die's denied  
And in the battle on the streets  
You fight computers and receipts  
And when a man is trying to change  
It only causes further pain  
You realize that all along  
Something in us going wrong...  
  
You stop dancing.  
  
I don't mind other guys dancing with my girl  
That's fine  
I know them all pretty well(Is it me? For a moment?)

Well, I saw it again  
(I saw it again)  
A form in my window  
(in my window)  
It wants to come in  
(it wants to come in)  
Well, I seen it before  
(I seen it before)  
  
When I wake in the night  
(when I wake up in the night I'm pulled from my dreams)  
Well, when something's not right  
I try not to look  
(but the curtains pull open its breathing I hear)  
For there is the shape  
That I fear  
And I'm fully woken  
I saw it again  
  
I saw it again  
I saw it again  
I saw it again  
I saw it again

We already played that  
We're going to lighten it up a bit

To read ICCULUS (or Ridicule us)  
A cold and lonely night  
Running the pace of her fright  
Look at her face tonight!  

Take me to another place, she said  
Take me to another time  
Run with me across the oceans  
Float me on a silver cloud  
  
If I could I would, but I don't know how  
If I could I would, but I don't know how  
If I could I would and I'd take you now  
  
Stay with me till time turns over  
I want to feel my feet leave the ground  
Take me where the whispering breezes  
Can lift me up and spin me around  
  
If I could I would...  
Hear you laughing as we go  
Flipping backward through the doors and through the windows  
I'm melting into nothing  
  
If I could I would, but I don't know how  
If I could I would, but I don't know how  
If I could I would and I'd take you now

The workers they come back from their day in the field  
Jennifer dances and she cooks me a meal  
A little less salt in the gravy tonight  
  
You ought to know from long ago  
To listen to the winds that blow  
Cause when the past creeps up at last  
You see the landscape open fast  
And you'll be standing on a landing  
Crumbling despite your demanding  
And in the pan the (?)  
Tears will fall and tears will bawl  
  
You always knew the winds that blew  
The workers they come back from their day in the field  
The workers they come back from their day in the field  
The workers they come back from their day in the field  
  
You always knew the winds that blew  
The workers they come back from their day in the field  
The workers they come back from their day in the field  
(Jennifer dances)  
The workers they come back from their day in the field  
(Jennifer dances)  
  
Jennifer dances  
Jennifer dances  
Jennifer dances  
Jennifer dances

Jesus left Chicago  
And he headed down to New Orleans  
Jesus left Chicago  
And he headed down to New Orleans  
Hey hey  
Workin' from one end to the other  
And all points in between  
  
Took a drive through Mississippi  
Muddy water turned to wine  
Took a drive through Mississippi  
Muddy water turned to wine  
Hey hey  
Went out to California  
Through the points and through the pines  
  
You might not see him in person  
But he'll see you just the same  
Might not see him in person  
But he'll see you just the same  
Hey hey  
Don't have to worry about nothin'  
'Cause takin' care of business is His name  
  
Jesus left Chicago  
And he headed down to New Orleans  
Jesus left Chicago  
And he headed down to New Orleans  
Hey hey  
Workin' from one end to the other  
And all points in between  
  
Thanks everyone  
This is a very cool room, I don't know how many of you  
Were here last time, but it's good to be back  
What's that?  
Sounds good, Mikesounds great, Mike  
Thank you man! Thank you ok Mike?  
He likes the way it sounds  
I know

Joy is over there in her incredible clothes  
She has silver silk shimmering down to her toes  
I was doing the best that I can I suppose  
But that little girl dancer  
Eventually grows  
Well she grows  
  
You can't imagine all the times that I tried  
To uncover the source of the tears that you cried  
Let's throw it away and just go for a ride  
And you'd say OK but you'd keep it inside  
And I tried  
I tried  
I tried  
I tried  
  
We want you to be happy  
Don't live inside the gloom  
We want you to be happy  
Come step outside your room  
We want you to be happy  
Cause this is your song too  
  
I never thought I could have it so good  
You were the song that my soul understood  
That time is a river that flows through the woods  
And it lead us to places we both understood  
Would be gone  
Before to long  
Would be gone  
Before to long  
  
When we were young we thought life was a game  
But then somebody leaves you and your never the same  
All of the places and people belong to the puzzle  
But one of the pieces is gone  
And it's you  
It's you  
It's you  
Joy, it's you  
  
We want you to be happy  
Don't live inside the gloom  
We want you to be happy  
Come step outside your room  
We want you to be happy  
Cause this is your song too  
  
Anytime we'll weather this storm  
Inside together you'll see the change  
When the sun shines through  
  
We want you to be happy  
Don't live inside the gloom  
We want you to be happy  
Come step outside your room  
We want you to be happy  
Cause this is your song too  
  
This is your song too  
This is your song too  
This is your song too  
This is your song too  
This is your song too  
This is your song too  
This is your song too  
This is your song too

Danger  
I've been told to expect it  
I begin my descent  
Down the cold granite steps  
  
And who could have turned among those I confide in?  
I think that I know what I haven't known yet  
'Cause a week is a month  
and an hour a day  
When your reaching just pushes it further away  
With your past and your future precisely divided  
Am I at that moment?  
I haven't decided  
  
And stretching out into the sea, Aquitana  
Is that what the prophet told me he saw?  
You gave it to me but I really don't want it  
I came out on top by the luck of the draw  
'Cause a week is a month and an hour a day  
When your reaching just pushes it further away  
And what's the return on the faith I've provided?  
I think that I know now but I haven't decided

I am the king of nothing  
The emperor of emptiness  
I don't have a castle  
And I don't wear a crown  
  
I recall as a small child  
The dreams that I once had  
Yes, I recall as a small boy  
Those dreams which drove me mad  
  
'Cause I once found myself a Kingdom  
It was not too far away  
I once found myself a Kingdom  
But somehow I let it slip away  
  
So I am the king of nothing  
The emperor of emptiness  
And I don't have a castle  
And I don't have a crown  
  
And I recall as a small child  
Those dreams I once had  
I recall as a small boy  
Those dreams which drove me mad  
  
I once found myself a Kingdom  
And I thought that it was here to stay  
Yes, I once found myself a Kingdom  
But somehow I let it slip away  
  
So I am the king of nothing  
The emperor of emptiness  
And I don't have a castle  
And I don't wear a crown

Swinging on the lifeline  
Fraying bits of twine  
Entangled in the remnants of the  
Knot I left behind  
And asking you to help me make it  
Finally unwind  
  
But God never listens to what I say  
God never listens to what I say  
And you don't get a refund  
If you overpray  
  
And when the line is breaking  
And when I'm near the end  
When all the time spent leading  
I've been following instead  
When all my thoughts and memories are  
Left hanging by a thread  
  
God never listens  
Stranded on this slender string  
The minutes seem to last a lifetime  
Dangling here between the light above  
And blue below that drags me down  
  
But God never listens to what I say  
God never listens to what I say  
And you don't get a refund  
If you overpray

The shoulder that I leaned on was carved out of stone  
But when I'm done freezing I want to be alone  
  
Never want my hand cut off  
Never want a hacking cough  
Never need a cliffside push  
Never turn my brain to mush  
  
Always give me what I lack  
Always take the best parts back  
Always recognize your fate  
Always just a moment late  
  
Left is where I always turn  
Left is how I'm forced to learn  
Left the route my walking takes  
Left alone with my mistakes  
  
Up against the person who  
Up 'til now I never knew  
Up from hell the answer blew  
Up or down it's up to you  
  
Drop me off the Chinese wall  
And peel my fingers off the rim  
I come unglued while in midair and land to reform  
Limb by limb  
  
And I am taken far away  
  
Lingering slowly melting away  
Tossed with the salad and baled with the hay  
Pooling the water that drips from above  
Trampled by lambs pecked by the dove

Passing through the corridor I came upon an aging knight  
Who leaned against the wall in gnarly armor  
He was on his way to see the king  
Wilson  
Wilson  
Wilson  
He led me through the streets of Prussia talking  
As he tried to crush a bug that scurried underneath his bootheel  
He said there was a place where we should go  
So he lead me through the forest to the edge of a lagoon by which  
We wandered 'til we reached a bubbly spring  
The knight grew very quiet as we stood there  
Then he lifted up his visor and he turned to me and he began to sing  
  
Chorus:  
  
He said I come from the land of darkness  
I said I come from the land of doom  
He said I come from the land of Gamehendge  
From the land of the big baboon  
But I'm never never going back there  
And I couldn't if I tried  
'Cause I come from the land of Lizards  
And the Lizards they have died  
And the Lizards they have died  
And the Lizards they have died  
And the Lizards they have died  
  
He told me that the Lizards were a race of people practically extinct  
From doing things smart people don't do  
He said that he was once a Lizard too  
His name was Rutherford the Brave and he was on a quest to save  
His people from the fate that lay before them.  
Their clumsy end was perilously near  
The Lizards would be saved, he said, if they could be enlightened  
By the writings of the Helping Friendly Book  
In all of Prussia only one existed  
And Wilson had declared that any person who possessed it was a crook  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
The Helping Friendly Book, it seemed, possessed the ancient secrets  
Of eternal joy and never-ending splendor  
The trick was to surrender to the flow  
We walked along beneath the moon  
He lead us through the bush 'till soon  
We saw before our eyes a raging river  
He said that we could swim it if we tried  
And saying this the knight dove in forgetting that his suit of arms  
Would surely weigh him down and so he sunk  
And as his body disappeared before me  
I bowed my head in silence and remembered all thoughts that he had thunk  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
But Rutherford and Forbin weren't alone. And suddenly an unexpected movement
caught his eye. On the far side of the river he saw a shaggy creature standing
in the weeds who stared across at Forbin with an unrelenting gaze. A gigantic
mass of muscles and claws. The hideous beast reared back and hurled himself in
the water and swam toward the region where Rutherford lay. And in a flash, the
beast was gone, underneath the surface to the frosty depths below while
Forbin, bewildered, waited alone. The seconds dragged by in what seemed like
hours till finally the colonel felt it all had been a dream. Defeated, he
bowed his head then turned to go. Suddenly with a roar, the creature emerged
before him and held the brave knight's body to the sky. And the creature laid
the knight upon the shore. And the colonel fell beside his friend in prayer
that he'd survive. And Rutherford, brave Rutherford was alive.  
  
Forbin and the unit monster were crouched over the soggy knight carefully
removing his bulky helmet when the colonel heard a sound behind him. He turned
around and came face to face with an enormous shaggy horse-like creature
covered from head to tail with alternating blotches of brown and white. It was
a two-toned multi-beast, and atop the multi-beast sat the most beautiful woman
the colonel had ever seen. After fifty-two years of undaunted bachelorhood,
the colonel felt a feeling rush over him as he had never felt before.

Honey, love ya honey little honey bunny Sunday mornin'  
Love ya more funny love in the skyline baby  
Ice cream 'scuse me I seen ya looking good the other evenin'.  
Oh, you dig it had to smile just an hour  
So if we're in love like I think we'll be  
It ain't a long rhyme it took ages to think  
I think I'll hurl it in the water baby.  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Thinkin you are a nice little one  
To put it all around you it's just good  
I like it  
I like it.  
Hey Hey Hey suppose sometime that day  
You won't be swingin along over across to me.  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Good time rocker woman,  
We'll stray our pieces  
Little creepy we shine so sleepy so whoopie!  
That's how you look.

Lucy sells her flowers for a quarter apiece  
She wound up on the streets  
She could not pay her lease  
She used to want to save the world  
But nothing to her matters now  
She lays bout the subway station  
Clad in dirty tatters now  
  
Lucy's in the subway with daffodils  
She lost all her diamonds  
And she sold all her pills  
She's been around the block  
But she's had too many thrills  
Lucy's in the subway with daffodils  
  
Lucy holds a dixie cup  
Of sixty cents in change  
And if she looks you in the eye  
You see that she's deranged  
She flew too near the sun  
And fried her fragile wings  
But to her faithful whisky bottle she clings  
  
Lucy's in the subway with daffodils  
She lost all her diamonds  
And she sold all her pills  
She's been around the block  
But she's had too many thrills  
Lucy's in the subway with daffodils

Marijuana (The government wants to test me when I pee)  
Words and Music: Brian Robbins  
  
Well once upon a time in 1776,  
Thomas Jefferson signed his name on a piece of marijuana,  
And this document was a symbol of freedom and of liberty,  
At least for the rich, white gentry.  
  
As time marched along,  
This plant that I refer to has been used for everything,  
From medicine to the American flag.  
And now it seems to me  
That somewhere along the way,  
Things got messed up, yeah, messed up.  
  
Oh marijuana.  
A gift of God to my brothers and me.  
Oh marijuana  
Now the government wants to test me when I pee.  
  
Well some say a conspiracy  
Of the petro-chemical and pulp-paper industries combined  
Ha to kill the compitition.  
Government hysteria, monopoly and conflict of interest,  
With total impunity.  
  
Yeah, so, if you don't buy the conspiracy,  
Just look at the reality  
That your tax dollars go  
To spray poison on the fields of a farmer in South America.  
And as an added bonus,  
Your neighbor might be the proud recipions of that poison weed.  
  
Oh marijuana  
Now the government wants to test me when I pee.  
Oh marijuana  
A gift of god to my brothers and me.  
Oh marijuana  
You can't legislate your own morality.  
Oh marijuana  
The government wants to test me when I pee  
  
Reefer madness, chronic sadness,  
What is the half-life of bad propaganda?  
Policies fail, denied bail,  
You made him a demon now pay for his trip to prison.  
Hired to promote the status quo,  
But what is the shelf life of bad legislation.  
The hypocrite smirks, it's a moral disgrace  
As he reads from a law that was written  
About the same time that he had  
His last original thought.  
  
Well the men said he was dying,  
And the nausea and the pain left him wasting away  
And unable to keep a meal down.  
So he tried everything a prescription could obtain  
But to no avail.  
The side effects were worse than the pain.  
So now he breaks the law  
To use the one thing that seems to help him out.  
And the people say, Oh he's just getting' high.  
But not to change the subject but,  
Didn't you ever wonder why getting' high's a crime,  
Yeah a crime.  
  
Oh marijuana, a gift to god to my brothers and me.  
Oh marijuana, now the government wants to test me when I pee.  
Oh marijuana, the government wants to test me when I pee.  
Oh marijuana, the government wants to test me when I pee.  
Oh marijuana, the government wants to test me when I pee.  
Oh marijuana, this is the part when everyone would sing along aha, when I pee

The overhead view is of me in a maze  
And you see what I'm hunting a few steps away  
And I take a wrong turn and I'm on the wrong path  
And the people all watching enjoy a good laugh  
  
Embarrassed with failure, I try to reverse  
The course that my tread had already traversed  
So doing the trauma engulfing my dream  
Invaded through what was an unguarded seam  
The torrent of helplessness swept me away  
To the cavern of shame and the hall of dismay  
Inside me a voice was repeating this phrase:  
"You've lost it, you'll never get out of this maze"  
  
You'll never get out of this maze  
You'll never get out of this maze  
You'll never get out of this maze  
You'll never get out of this maze  
You'll never get out of this maze  
You'll never get out of this maze  
You'll never get out of this maze

I've alternated my meager flock  
To the shores of the Baltic Sea  
The teeth of time have stowed the rhyme  
Of how things should be  
My cave, my house, my turning wheel  
My little docking pup  
The march of Colonel Forbin  
And his fleet hound called McGrupp  
The grime of countless workdogs  
Has collected in my sink  
I tie my nose with spandex hose  
Before I get a drink  
While on frozen warthogs  
With its poison in our minds  
The ferns that spot our children  
Are encased in orange rinds  
All times and seasons are the reasons  
That people and their clans  
Have stowed the Famous Mockingbird  
With glue and rubber bands  
They writhe and cry in agony  
As Rutherford the Brave  
Chokes Tela and the Unit Monster  
Managing to save  
The spotted striper's multi-beast  
And there by cheat his grave  
I'd like to get his autograph  
But he looks too much like Dave  

I am a prince I have it all  
I hear your footsteps through the wall  
I wait in silence for your call  
Then take a shot and watch you fall  
  
I am a ghost but I cannot fly  
I'm stuck here as the years slide by  
I need a resting place 'cause I  
Already felt my body die  
  
If I had a host of ghosts  
Living on my street  
I'd jive and strive to stay alive  
And offer them some meat  
  
I need a different life I think  
Perhaps I'd be the missing link  
And treasure moments as I drink  
Away the memories let the sink

Oh tequila, I turn to you like a long lost friend  
I want to kiss my Mexican cousin once again  
We'll cover every emotion from happiness to sorrow  
And the conversations I forget you'll tell me about tomorrow  
When the phone calls start, am I in bed or in a hearse?  
The things you tell me about myself can't make me feel any worse  
Well I'm awful sorry you got pissed  
Just have to cross you off the list  
of my true friends...  
And tequila's where that starts and where it ends

The old man knows very well  
Going down by the snowbank, there's a mound  
A mound that an old man knows good  
Look who raises his shoe all over this mound  
Right over the world that's another rewind  
  
And it's time, time, time for the last rewind  
For a broken old man and a world unkind  
He buried all his memories of home  
In an icy clump that lies beneath the ground  
  
No one knows how far he traveled  
Oh! I heard he walked miles from the little mound  
Can he find some shelter?  
He doesn't know to behold what the cold frost can do  
And at last till he realized he'd circled back around  
Round a back circle, round a back realized  
  
Ice is all he was made of  
The bitter blue, and frozen through  
He went over to the mound  
Reclining down his final thoughts  
Were drifting to the time this life had shined

My friend, my friend he's got a knife  
A statement from his former life  
When he was easy but alone  
Beside him was an empty throne  
But what of silver silken blade  
Affix his gaze, his features staid  
Grasps the handle, clips the cable  
One steps up, sits at his table  
My friend, my friend, he's got a knife  
My friend, my friend, he's got a wife  
  
My friend, my friend, the clever ruse  
Persuasion through his thoughts peruse  
A hidden relic from his past  
That wasn't there when he looked last  
He feels it ticking like a bomb  
Feeding fear, assaulting calm  
Takes the object, starts the game  
Moves closer to the flame  
  
My friend, my friend, the clever ruse  
My friend, my friend, he lights the fuse  
  
My friend, my friend, he's got a knife  
My friend, my friend, he's got a knife  
My friend, my friend, he's got a knife

My mind's got a mind of its own  
It takes me out a walkin' when I'd rather stay at home  
Takes me out to parties when I'd rather be alone  
My mind's got a mind of its own  
  
I've been doing things I thought I'd never do  
I've been getting into trouble without ever meaning to  
I'd as soon settle down but I'm right back up again  
I feel just like a leaf out in the wind.  
  
(chorus)  
I seem to forget half the things I start  
I try to build a house and then I tear the place apart  
I freeze myself on fire and then I burn myself on ice  
I can't count to one without thinking twice  
  
(chorus)  
I tell myself to do the things I should  
And then I get to thinkin' that them things ain't any good.  
I tell myself the truth but know I'm lying like a snake  
You can't walk on water at the bottom of a lake.

My sweet one, I'll call you my sweet one  
You're my only true sweet one  
With my all, I'll call you my sweet one  
From far away, I'll say your name  
  
Oh with you, I'd travel thick  
And with you, I'd also travel thin  
And all the spaces in between  
I'd travel with you  
You're my sweet one  
  
But for now I must sit jail here and ponder the yonder  
Herbivores ate well cause their food didn't never run  
  
Oh, if You're ever unsatisfied with the way life's treating You  
You know You can count on me to take good care of You  
I love you honey oh yes I do You know that's true of course  
and if your dog or cat ever dies, I'll buy You a Ewe

Appendages flailing, you're running at me  
Ferocious, tenaciously clawing at me  
The devious gelatin holding me fast  
Miraculous now you let me move past  
Over the wall rushing rivers of sleaze  
The tips of stalactites incising my knees  
A slipper, a sand dollar day at the shore  
Nice evening at home that I dread even more  
Would you please  
Make clear to me  
I'm peering out through your opacity  
Though you rehearse  
Tomorrow's verse  
Forgive me if I don't sing in your key  
Look back on those days when my life was a haze  
The gelatin lay on a truncated sleigh  
Copernicus drank from a vessel that stank  
The free masons crank to the overflow tank  
  
Bane of the weasel, for biding his fun  
Jump on the turnstile and watch me go 'round  
Swim with the cactus and float with the stone  
I try to convey what you strive to condone  
  
Da da, da da, da-da, da da doo  
Da da, da da, da-da, da da doo  
Da da, da da, da-da, da da da-da da da da da do  
  
Would you please  
Make clear to me  
I'm peering out through your opacity  
Though you rehearse  
Tomorrow's verse  
Forgive me if I don't sing in your key  
  
Would you please (In all that dust and stone)  
Make clear to me (And when you see me)  
Why nothing is the first thing that I see  
?  
  
And if you do (In all that dirt and stone)  
And I see you (And when you see me)  
Then you will be the nothing left for me  
?

Desmond has his barrow in the market place...  
Molly is the singer in a band...  
Desmond says to Molly "Girl, I like your face"  
And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand...  
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah!...  
Lala how the life goes on...  
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah!...  
Lala how the life goes on.  
  
Desmond takes a trolley to the jewelry store...  
Buys a twenty carat golden ring...  
Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door...  
And as he gives it to her she begins to sing...  
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah!...  
Lala how the life goes on...  
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah!...  
Lala how the life goes on.  
  
In a couple of years they have built a home sweet home,  
With a couple of kids running in the yard,  
Of Desmond and Molly Jones... (Ha ha ha ha ha)  
  
Happy ever after in the market place...  
Desmond lets the children lend a hand...  
Molly stays at home and does her pretty face...  
And in the evening she still sings it with the band...  
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah!...  
Lala how the life goes on...  
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah!...  
Lala how the life goes on.

It's been ten long years since I left my home in the hollow where I was born  
Where the cool fall nights make the woods smell right and the fox hunter blows
him horn  
I fell in love with a girl from the town, I thought that she would be true  
I ran away to Charlottsville and worked in a sawmill or two  
What have they done to the old home place?  
Why did they tear it down?  
And why did I leave the plow in the field and look for a job in the town?  
Now the girl ran off with somebody else, tariffs took all my pay  
And here I stand where the old home stood before they took it away  
Now geese fly south and the cold wind blows as I stand here and hang my head  
I lost my love and lost my home, and now I wish that I was dead  
(Chorus)

She started a blaze from one tiny spark  
I didn't even detect  
She loved the light, was dismayed by the dark  
The stars though she seemed to respect  
  
The faint light that flutters at night to the  
earth  
Would land in her eyes and collect  
Luminous creatures she'd find in the surf  
I never thought to inspect  
  
Pebbles and marbles like things on my mind  
Seem to get lost and harder to find  
When I am alone I am inclined  
If I find a pebble in sand  
To think that it fell from my hand  
  
She gave me ideas  
Planted the seed  
But she never stopped to reflect  
The course that she's on, wherever it leads  
I never would redirect  
  
Pebbles and marbles like words from a friend  
Make us hold tight but are lost in the end  
When we're alone we all seem to tend  
If we find a marble in dust  
To wish someone left it for us

You won't steal my poor heart again  
You won't steal my poor heart again  
You won't steal my tape recorder  
I'll call the Lord and he'll put you in the pen  
You won't steal that thing again  
  
I didn't even know your name or what was your game  
But stealin' things has sure brought you to fame  
I want to know if you stole mine  
It was one of a kind and I'm sayin' if you're to blame  
Your life will never be the same  
  
I can't track you anymore  
Detective work has sure become a bore  
So tell me what you did with it  
And stop this shit, give up yourself  
Before they come knockin' at your door  
  
You won't steal my poor heart again  
You won't steal my poor heart again  
When I feel the blade of that Cupid sword  
I'll call the Lord and he'll put you in the pen  
You won't steal that thing again  
You won't steal my poor heart again

I come from atop the mountain, baby  
Where the people come to pray  
I comes from atop the mountain baby  
Where the people come to pray  
  
There ain't no truth in action  
'Less you believe it anyway  
  
I was riding down the road one day  
Someone hit a possum  
Riding down the road one day  
Someone hit a possum  
  
The road was his end  
His end was that road, so they say  
  
Whoa, possum, possum, possum, possum  
Whoa, possum, possum, possum, possum  
Whoa, possum, possum, your end is the road  
  
I was riding down the road one day  
Someone hit a possum  
Riding down the road one day  
Someone hit a possum  
  
The road was his end  
His end was that road, so they say  
  
Whoa, possum, possum, possum, possum  
Whoa, possum, possum, possum, possum  
Whoa, possum, possum, your end is the road  
Whoa, possum, possum, your end is the road

Prep school hippie

I can't decide  
Should I spend my adolescent days wearing tie dyes or Vuarnets  
I can't decide  
Big ten kegger at the frat  
Or watching Jerry shake his fat  
  
Prep school hippie

Oh, to be Prince Caspian afloat upon the waves  
Oh, to be Prince Caspian afloat upon the waves  
Oh, to be Prince Caspian afloat upon the waves  
Oh, to be Prince Caspian,  
With nothing to return to but the demons in their caves  
  
Oh, to be Prince Caspian afloat upon the waves  
Oh, to be Prince Caspian afloat upon the waves  
Oh, to be Prince Caspian afloat upon the waves  
Oh, to be Prince Caspian,  
And the children in the fields all sowing seed and chaffing wheat  
Oh, to be Prince Caspian with stumps instead of feet  
  
Oh to be Prince Caspian  
Oh to be Prince Caspian  
Oh to be Prince Caspian

Hey, hey, hey, hey  
Come from the North where the oceans freeze  
Spent three long months at the open seas  
Paddled 'til it seemed I could take no more  
Till I hit the ground on Prussia's shores  
How was I to know that day  
That the winds had swept me Wilson's way  
But soon towards me from the East  
Came Wilson and his men on multi-beast  
Hey!  
Well, it seemed he didn't like my face  
And I quickly learned that Prussia was an evil place  
They tied me to a chair with a giant clip  
And held a piece of paper to my tender nip  
Then they tossed the chair in a tiny shack  
And told me not to worry 'cause they'd soon be back  
But I loosened up the binds where my hands were lashed  
And ran towards the cove where my boat was stashed  
Singing, "Oh Wilson, someday I'll kill you 'til you die  
Oh Wilson, punch you in the eye"  
Hey!  
Now Wilson knew that I was loose  
I'd surely be subjected to some real abuse  
Maybe end up hanging from the nearest tree  
So angrily I paddled to the open sea  
But the sea was eager to beat me back  
And the waves grew huge and deadly black  
And the gray clouds rumbled over my head  
And I feared in my heart that I'd soon be dead  
When the morning came and the storm had passed  
The dismal fog began at last  
To open up before my eyes  
And there I saw to my surprise  
Chains and specks of islands curved  
Where palm trees dipped and seagulls swerved  
Parked my kayak on a stone  
And yelled across the ocean to his evil throne  
I said, "Oh Wilson, someday I'll kill you 'til you die  
Oh Wilson, punch you in the eye  
Wilson, kill you 'til you die  
Oh Wilson, punch you in the eye"  

I never meant to cause you any sorrow  
I never meant to cause you any pain  
I only wanted one time to see you laughing  
I only wanted to see you laughing in the purple rain  
  
Purple rain, purple rain  
Purple rain, purple rain  
Purple rain, purple rain  
I only wanted to see you bathing in the purple rain  
  
I never wanted to be your weekend lover  
I only wanted to be some kind of friend, hey  
Baby, I could never steal you from another  
It's such a shame our friendship had to end  
  
Purple rain, purple rain  
Purple rain, purple rain  
Purple rain, purple rain  
I only wanted to see you underneath the purple rain  
  
Honey, I know, I know, I know times are changin'  
It's time we all reach out for something new, that means you too  
You say you want a leader, but you can't seem to make up your mind  
And I think you better close it and let me guide you to the purple rain  
  
Purple rain, purple rain  
Purple rain, purple rain  
If you know what I'm singin' about up here, come on raise your hand  
Purple rain, purple rain  
I only want to see you, only want to see you in the purple rain

Reba sink a boulder in the water  
Reba tie a cable to a tree  
Reba stuck in a game of lipstick perfume flypaper  
Reba press a razor to a slide cross a needle with a prune  
  
Knee deep in the motel tub  
Reba dangle ladle form her lip  
Dip  
Sip  
Reba babble to the nag with the lipstick perfume  
Mutter to a farmer in a truck  
  
Take a peek at the cheetah, Reba  
Cheetah on the prowl in a cage  
Sink a boulder in the water  
Tie a cable to a tree  
  
Mutter "nature" to the nag  
With the lipstick perfume  
Reba flush a fleshfarm leftover  
Thunder in a circle  
Down the pipes  
  
Bag it  
Tag it  
Sell it to the butcher in the store  
  
Reba put a stopper in the bottom of the tub  
Picked up a jar unscrewed the top  
And watched it drop into the water  
  
A little scoop of plaster mix  
Some coffee grounds and mud  
And then she stirred it with the ladle  
That her Grandmother had bought her  
Threw in a pot of melted wax  
A forefoot and a hoof  
Apple core, worms galore  
And a can of some corrosive  
  
Coconuts and chloroform  
Some wicker and some cork  
Toxic waste, some purple paste  
She hoped was not explosive  
  
Reba dip a ladle for a taste of her creation  
And she knew that what she make  
Would be the finest in the nation

The revolution's over baby  
The revolution's over baby now  
The revolution's over baby  
The revolution's over baby now  
  
Reelin' and Quakin'  
Bringin' home the bacon!  
We're all getting taken for a ride  
  
Kiss your mama goodbye  
Time to let it all fly  
Don't get caught  
With your fingers in the pie  
  
The revolution's over baby  
The revolution's over baby now  
The revolution's over baby  
The revolution's over baby now  
  
Time to start a new one  
Different than the old one  
Something that they've never seen before  
  
The revolution's over baby now  
The revolution's over baby now  
The revolution's over baby now  
The revolution's over baby now

Last night, in the moments my thoughts were adrift  
And coasting a terrace, approaching a rift  
Through which I could spy several glimpses beneath  
Of the darkness the light from above could not reach  
I spied wings of reason, herself taking flight  
And upon yonder precipice saw her alight  
And glared back at me one last look of dismay  
As if she were the last one she thought I'd betray  
  
So much better I said to myself  
And drawing quite close to the top of the shelf  
I struggled with destiny upon the ledge  
And gasped when defeated he slipped off the edge  
And silence contagious in moments like these  
Consumed me and strengthened my will to appease  
The passion that sparked me one terrible night  
And shocked and persuaded my soul to ignite  
  
So much better I said to myself  
And drawing quite close to the top of the shelf  
I struggled with destiny upon the ledge  
And gasped when defeated he slipped off the edge  
  
And silence contagious in moments like these  
Consume me and strengthen my will to appease  
  
The passion that sparked me one terrible night  
(And shocked and persuaded my soul to ignite) x5

Now somewhere in the black mining hills of Dakota  
There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon  
And one day his woman ran off with another guy  
Hit young Rocky in the eye Rocky didn't like that  
He said I'm gonna get that boy  
So one day he walked into town  
Booked himself a room in the local saloon.  
  
Rocky Raccoon checked into his room  
Only to find Gideon's bible  
Rocky had come equipped with a gun  
To shoot off the legs of his rival  
His rival it seems had broken his dreams  
By stealing the girl of his fancy.  
Her name was Magil and she called herself Lil  
But everyone knew her as Nancy.  
Now she and her man who called himself Dan  
Were in the next room at the hoedown  
Rocky burst in and grinning a grin  
He said Danny boy this is a showdown  
But Daniel was hot-he drew first and shot  
And Rocky collapsed in the corner.  
  
The doctor came in stinking of gin  
And proceeded to lie on the table  
He said Rocky you met your match  
And Rocky said, Doc it's only a scratch  
And I'll be better I'll be better doc as soon as I am able.  
  
Now Rocky Raccoon he fell back in his room  
Only to find Gideon's bible  
Gideon checked out and he left it no doubt  
To help with good Rocky's revival.

The circus is the place for me with bears and clowns and noise  
I love the shiny music that descends from overhead  
Gordan knew the moment when the stars all turned around  
But from that vantage point I frowned  
  
If life were easy and not so fast  
I wouldn't think about the past  
I can't forget to turn the earth so both sides get their share  
Of darkness and of light  
  
So now I wander over grounds of light and heat and sound and mist  
Provoking dreams that don't exist  
A circus of light where dreams can take flight  
In the peacefulness dreaming dreams brings

Take a piece of tinsel  
And put it on the tree  
Cut a slab a melon  
And pretend that you still love me  
  
Carve out a pumpkin  
And rely on your destiny  
Get in your car  
And cruise the land of the brave  
  
And the free  
But don't forget to understand  
Exactly what you put on the tree  
Don't believe the florist when he tells  
  
You that the roses are free  
Take a wrinkled raisin  
And do with it what you will  
Push it into third  
  
If you know your gonna climb a hill  
Eat plenty of lasagna  
'Til you know that you had your fill  
Resist all the urges  
  
That make you want to go out and kill  
But don't forget to understand  
Exactly what you put on the tree  
Don't believe the florist when he tells  
  
You that the roses are free  
Throw that pumpkin at the tree  
Unless you think that pumpkin  
Holds your destiny  
  
Cast it off into the sea  
Bake that pie and eat it with me

My room is tound when I lay dowm when I wake up it's sqare  
When I go outside it's on a spiral set of stairs  
The people that souround me are waiting out there  
In a round room they can't find me anywhere  
  
Right angle rooms drive me craizer each day  
Put me in a box I know I'm never going to play  
Put me in a square room and I won't know what to say  
I want a round room at the end of the day  
  
I had an apartment, four corners on the walls  
couldn't eat, couldn't sleep there at all  
I want a curve to the place where I stay  
I want a round room at the end of the day  
  
If I pass out take me to the round church  
where echoes resound  
and my spirit is found  
and when I float high  
Take my armand I'll fly by you  
The outskirts of town, to a garden that's round  
  
I went to the lighthouse and I likes the veiw  
I looked out the window and I could see you  
Put me in a sqare house and I won't have a clue  
I want a round room just to be with you

I had a dog, his name was Jim  
(Runaway, runaway, runaway)  
Took all of my old clothes with him  
(Runaway, runaway, runaway)  
Oh, runaway Jim  
Oh, runaway Jim  
He was twelve years old when his trip began  
(Runaway, runaway, runaway)  
Hauling down the highway in my old sedan  
(Runaway, runaway, runaway)  
Oh, runaway Jim  
Oh, runaway Jim  
Now I wish someone'd tell me where old Jim went  
(Runaway, runaway, runaway)  
'Cause he took all the money that I saved for rent  
(Runaway, runaway, runaway)  
Oh, runaway Jim  
Oh, runaway Jim  
Time he came home, he was seventeen  
(Runaway, runaway, runaway)  
That's a hundred nineteen to you and me  
(Runaway, runaway, runaway)  
Oh, runaway Jim  
Oh, runaway Jim  
Now I'm gonna go up to the mountain  
(Runaway, runaway, runaway)  
Singing for Dave who's swimming in the fountain  
(Runaway, runaway, runaway)  
Oh, runaway Jim  
Oh, runaway Jim  
Oh, runaway dogs  
Oh, runaway dog  

It's hidden far away  
But someday I may tell  
The tale of metal tangle  
When into your world I fell  
Without you now I wander soaking  
Secretly afraid  
'Cause in your grasp the fears don't last  
(And some of them have stayed)  
  
I wheeled around because I  
Didn't hear what you had said  
And saw you dancing with Elihu  
Up on Leemor's bed  
And I was foggy rather groggy, you helped me to my car  
The binding belt enclosing me, a Sample in a Jar  
  
And on the market stands unfolding  
With all their willies and their wares  
I shuffle by alert but numb  
To all the glances and the glares  
And I think of you unheeding  
All the times I raise my cup  
It's now I know that you knew that  
I'd soon end up end up  
  
I wheeled around because I  
Didn't hear what you had said  
And saw you dancing with Elihu  
Up on Leemor's bed  
And I was foggy rather groggy, you helped me to my car  
The binding belt enclosing me, a Sample in a Jar  
  
You tricked me like the others  
And now I don't belong  
The simple smiles and good times seem all wrong

If you can heal the symptoms  
But not affect the cause  
It's quite a bit like trying to heal  
The gunshot wound with gauze  
If you instead attempt to rest  
The pistol from the hand  
Then I would not be able to  
Equate my life with sand  
  
Flowing through the hourglass  
Pushing through the funnel  
Turn once more and racing  
All your siblings for the tunnel  
Slide and let the silicone  
Embrace you as you fall  
Then bounce around  
And let your brothers  
Crush you to the wall  
  
I would choose my own religion  
Worship my own spirit  
But if he ever preached to me  
I wouldn't want to hear it  
I'd drop him a forgotten god  
Languishing in shame  
And then if I hit stormy seas  
I'd have myself to blame  
  
If you can heal the symptoms,  
But not affect the cause  
You can't heal the symptoms

Kitty Malone sat on a mule  
Was riding in style  
When suddenly, like the sound of a buzzard's breaking  
Kitty felt laser beams being fired at her head  
She said, "I hate laser beams  
And you never done see me askin'  
For a UFO  
In Tomahawk County"  
  
Well she kicked the mule  
And it walked the path  
And the aliens fired from behind  
Till she stopped the mule  
And she kicked the rump  
And the big old mule took a big old dump  
  
[Chorus]  
Scent of a mule, you better watch out where you go  
Take your laser beams away  
Scent of a mule, you better watch out where you go  
You better stop that laser game  
Or you'll smell my mule  
  
She felt the fire against her neck  
And it saddened her to feel it burn  
When suddenly, like the sound of a breeding Holstein  
Kitty said, "Stop, we ain't lookin' for fightin'  
In Tomahawk County."  
  
A little guy from the UFO  
Came on out and said his name was Joe  
She said, "Come on over for some lemonade  
Just follow me now with the whole brigade"  
  
[Chorus]  
  
They walked into her cabin shack  
They had never seen a southern home  
And they liked it, better than their UFO  
They liked it, they really liked it  
They said, "Here's a place of elegance  
Here we shower ourselves in lightness"  
  
[Chorus]

If you would only start to live  
One moment at a time  
You would, I think, be startled  
By the things that you would find  
  
Like scents you never noticed  
And many subtle sounds  
Like colors in the landscape  
And textures of the town  
  
Then the winds would lift you up  
Into the sky above  
And you'd be treated to a view  
Of everything you love  
And if the moment passes  
You should try it once again  
For if you do it right  
You'll find the moment never ends

Here by the sea and sand  
Nothing ever goes as planned,  
I just couldn't face going home  
It was just a drag on my own.  
They finally threw me out  
My mom got drunk on stout,  
My dad couldn't stand on two feet,  
As he lectured about morality.  
Now I guess the family's complete,  
With me hanging round on the street  
Or here on the beach.  
  
The girl I love  
Is a perfect dresser,  
Wears every fashion  
Gets it to the tee.  
Heavens above,  
I got to match her  
She knows just how  
She wants her man to be  
Leave it to me.  
  
My jacket's gonna be cut slim and checked  
Maybe a touch of seersucker with an open neck  
I ride a G.S. scooter with my hair cut neat  
I wear my wartime coat in the wind and sleet.  
  
I see her dance  
Across the ballroom  
UV light making starshine  
Of her smile.  
I am the face,  
She has to know me,  
I'm dressed up better than anyone  
Within a mile.  
  
So how come the other tickets look much better?  
Without a penny to spend they dress to the letter.  
How come the girls come on oh so cool  
Yet when you meet 'em, every one's a fool?  
  
Come sleep on the beach  
Keep within my reach  
I just want to die with you near  
I'm feeling so high with you here.  
I'm wet and I'm cold  
But thank God I ain't old  
Why didn't I ever say what I mean?  
I should have split home at fifteen.  
There's a story that the grass is so green,  
What did I see?  
Where have I been?  
  
Nothing is planned, by the sea and the sand

Grass has been greater  
Skies have been bluer  
I know my soul is down in the sewer  
  
You say that I am selfish  
Well you know that that is true  
I don't care what you say pretty mama  
And I don't care what you do  
  
I don't care about anyone except myself  
I don't care about anyone except myself  
In the land of the brave  
And the home of the free  
I don't care about anyone except for me  
  
If you are unhappy and  
You have not won your race  
Well, there ain't no mercy in this world  
And there ain't none out in space  
  
So welcome to the nineties  
I hope that you make it through  
But if you get in trouble honey  
This is what I say to you  
  
I don't care about anyone except myself  
I don't care about anyone except myself  
In the land of the brave  
And the home of the free  
I don't care about anyone except for me  
  
This is not the era of roses, peace and love  
I must admit I'm the only one  
That I'm thinking of  
  
Well, I just make my honey  
And I put it in the bank  
I buy myself some presents  
With no one but myself to thank

Give me a word and give me a sign  
Show me where to go and tell what will I find  
What will I find?  
  
Lay me on the ground and fly me through the air  
Show me where to go and tell me will love be there?  
Will love be there?  
  
Yeah  
  
Oh, heaven let your light shine down  
Oh, heaven let your light shine down  
Oh, heaven let your light shine down  
Oh, heaven let your light shine down

My glance is always darting, when I stroll the avenue  
Avoiding all the obstacles that terrorize my view  
If you are here with me, I trust you to lead the way  
When you're not I follow you, and always go astray  
  
Silent in the morning  
Suspended in the trees  
Lunch time comes you've found your voice  
It brings me to my knees  
The volume just increases  
The resounding echoes grow  
Till once again I bask in morning stillness, I love so  
  
The target that I shoot for seems to move with every breath  
I tighten all my arteries and make one last request  
Divine creation hears me, and he squashes me with fear  
I think that this exact thing happened to me, just last year  
  
Silent in the morning  
You found your voice that brings me to  
Silent in the morning  
You found your voice that brings me to  
Silent in the morning  
You found your voice that brings me to my knees  
I will not dismiss you, shelter you, speak with you  
Smile at you, trust in me, He'd like to brush you off, and I'd agree

I can't describe the feeling when  
  
I'm in my bed asleep and then  
I wake up with a vision blurred  
And all my efforts are deterred  
To reconstruct this image lost  
  
There're certain things my mind must do  
And even though they're very few  
The image glistens like a gem  
  
Repairing is not one of them  
So I'm awake though in my mind  
The image that's so unrefined  
Is calling to me from the deep  
And tempting me to fall asleep

They call me the sloth  
Way down in the ghetto  
Italian spaghetti  
Singing falsetto  
Sleeping all day  
Rip Van Winklin'  
Spend my nights in bars  
Glasses tinklin'  
I'm so bad  
He's so nasty  
Ain't got no friends  
Real outcasty  
Stay out of my way  
Ed up a cripple  
I'll take this piece of paper  
Slice your nipple  
They call me the sloth  
Way down in the ghetto  
Italian spaghetti  
Singing falsetto  
Sleeping all day  
Rip Van Winklin'  
Spend my nights in bars  
Glasses tinklin'

The pressure builds, you buy a gift  
You're hoping that your dread will lift  
It glitters on her like a glass  
You shudder as it comes to pass  
Apologize to Luce and Lil'  
Converse with Ed, a drive with Jill  
Your friends confine you in their worlds  
One by one, a string of pearls  
Confuse you say, this isn't me  
You hover in their unity  
Ashamed, you slowly lose your grasp  
Release the links, undo the clasp  
The skin that drips down from the tree  
And peels back slowly from your knee  
Erupts into your lung and heart  
You laugh and laughing, fall apart  
  
Laugh and laughing, fall apart  
Laugh and laughing, fall apart  
Laugh and laughing, fall apart  
Laugh and laughing, fall apart  
Laugh and laughing, fall apart  
Laugh and laughing, fall apart  
Laugh and laughing, fall apart  
  
Laugh and laughing, fall apart  
Laugh and laughing, fall apart

Odors in the evening mist  
Spices that you can't resist  
Curl around and resound  
Through caverns that the breeze has kissed  
  
Drawn inside, you hear a tone  
As each foot hits a stepping stone  
The music soothes and calms your mood  
But suddenly you're not alone  
  
A single cloud within a storm  
Descends and leaves behind a form  
Someone that you knew appears in front of you  
A woman's figure, rain-cloud-born  
  
She blinks but doesn't see you yet  
She shivers and is soaking wet  
You cross the sand and take her hand  
A lifetime passed since last you met  
  
Centuries now fall away  
(expand the years) ?? Since yesterday  
When you were young and in the sun  
You let your woman slip away  
  
You take the hands that you have missed  
And kiss the lips you haven't kissed  
For many years  
Taste the tears  
  
Spices that you can't resist

I can't talk my talk with you  
Nothing's ever soaking through  
The filter that surrounds your thoughts  
And holds out lessons left untaught  
  
I can't talk my talk with you  
Nothing's ever soaking through  
The filter that surrounds your thoughts  
And holds out lessons left untaught  
  
I can't talk my talk with you  
  
I can't sing my song with you  
Nothing's ever soaking through  
The filter that surrounds your thoughts  
And holds out lessons left untaught  
  
I can't sing this song with you  
Nothing's ever soaking through  
The filter that surrounds your thoughts  
And holds out lessons left untaught  
  
I can't sing my song with you  
I can't talk my talk with you

I'm up and I can take what you give  
And I'm here but I don't want you to live with me  
'Cause all I want is a taste for free  
  
I'm down and I will drag you along and around  
Until you burst into song and unwind  
And leave your new life behind for a while  
  
Cause I can see through the lines  
Cause I can see through the lines  
  
I'm down and I will drag you along and around  
Until you burst into song and unwind  
And leave your new life behind for a while  
  
I'm out and I will stay here alone and without  
Someone controlled by the phone and TV  
'Cause what it's doing to me is fine  
  
Cause I can see through the lines  
Cause I can see through the lines  
  
Oh oh  
Step into space  
Oh oh  
Alter my place  
Oh oh  
That someone else made  
Why I have stayed  
Into things I could be  
Or if I could see  
Into fog that surrounds  
And pins me to the ground  
  
I can see through the lines  
I can see through the lines  
I can see through the lines  
I can see through the lines

When I see the connection  
Though I see, I don't stare  
Though I see, I don't stare  
  
When I'm lost in my reflection  
Though I see, I don't stare  
Though I see, I don't stare  
  
Then I change my direction  
One foot follows the other  
One foot follows something new  
'Cause I need some protection  
And I'm scared I could lose it  
If I stare, you'll be gone  
  
When I need some attention  
Though I see, I don't stare  
Though I see, I don't stare  
  
When I see the connection  
Though I see, I don't stare  
Though I see, I don't stare  
  
When I'm lost in my reflection  
Though I see, I don't stare  
Though I see, I don't stare  
  
Then I change my direction  
One foot follows the other  
One foot follows something new  
'Cause I need some protection  
And I'm scared I could lose it  
If I stare, you'll be gone

Ahhh!  
Divided sky, the wind blows high  
  
[The divided sky chant is part of an ancient ritual dating back to the  
Pre-Wilson years of She purity in Gamehendge. After listening to the  
Sacred sounds for a sloping lawn, three chosen subjects eat a special  
Root collected at the base of the enormous mountain that rises in the  
Center of the forest. The root is believed to contain the spirit of  
Icculus, who lives at the top of the mountain. After eating the root,  
They venture into a vast field at sundown. The field is deep green,  
And stretches as far as the eye can see in all directions. In the  
Center of the field stands an enormous black rhombus. They climb the  
Rhombus and begin to sing, paying homage to the gods of the night  
Sky.]

Dry mouth, push it out, I can hear my heart pound, a hero's what I'm not  
Voices scream, flashes flare, frozen as the people stare, my crucifixion shot  
  
Friends were electric on the western side while triangles were shifting on the
floor  
Squeezing out the breath that I don't have, they're quiet now, they only want
to more  
  
And you step to the line  
And you step to the line  
  
Every shot I've taken has led me to this moment since I was four feet high  
Big D is watching, I remember what he taught me, don't let him see you cry  
  
And you step to the line  
And you step to the line  
  
Try to see your future from the line  
And you're clinging to the notion you'll be fine  
But the circle's getting smaller all the time  
Try to see your future from the line  
And you're clinging to the notion you'll be fine  
But the circle's getting smaller all the time  
  
Dry mouth, push it out, I can hear my heart pound, a hero's what I'm not  
Voices scream, flashes flare, frozen as the people stare, my crucifiction shot  
  
And you step to the line  
And you step to the line  
  
You try to see your future from the line  
Clinging to the notion you'll be fine  
But the circle's getting smaller all the time  
You try to see your future from the line  
And you're clinging to the notion you'll be fine  
But the circle's getting smaller all the time  
You try to see your future from the line  
You're clinging to the notion you'll be fine  
But the circle's getting smaller all the time  
You try to see your future from the line  
Clinging to the notion you'll be fine  
But the circle's getting smaller...

Spasm waiter dropping to his knees, sees  
Slander on wrap paper ties  
Lifting up his head he feels the sunlight in his eyes  
  
Grasp a kettle top and shoot the breeze, please  
Ramble while slop scraper sighs  
Tossing in his bed at night he'll dream until he dies  
  
Operations at the sink  
The dribble liquid visible beneath his troubled eyes  
Feels it tilt and start to slide  
  
Mask a pretty hopper's foot with squeeze cheese  
Dangle some grape apple pies  
Tranquil and serene until he runs out of supplies  
  
Your hands and feet are mangoes  
You're gonna be a genius anyway  
  
Your hands and feet are mangoes  
You're gonna be a genius anyway

And all throughout I gaze and glimpse you  
Loving never did convince you  
I see you when you're all alone  
It's like a person I've not known  
  
The moment ends though I feel winds  
Blowing differently than ever before  
And they're pushing me further from shore  
  
A frothy cap the steady slap  
Of lines against the rail  
A biting rain take in the main  
  
Up the rigging take in sail mind the skipper we'll not fail  
He'll bring out wine all will be fine just hear the order watch the sail  
The moment ends

The Squirming Coil of sunset  
I keep within my reach  
Tried yesterday to get away  
And hitchhiked to the beach  
  
I saw Satan on the beach  
Trying to catch a ray  
He wasn't quite the speed of light  
And the squirming coil  
It got away  
  
The muscles flex the mother's ring  
She fastens children to her king  
And sends him down the crooked street  
When he returns, the birth's complete  
  
Jimmy holds the Tannis root  
The forest's tasty nectar shoot  
The sun tips off the monarch's suit  
From sequined sash to shiny boot  
  
"I'd like to lick the coil some day  
Like Icarus, who had to pay  
With melting wax and feathers brown  
He tasted it on his way down"  
  
Stun the puppy!  
Burn the whale!  
Bark a scruff and go to jail!  
Forge the coin and lick the stamp!  
Little Jimmy's off to camp

We're bobbing on the surface  
and the shadow glides below  
They say she feels my heartbeat  
Oh, but how I'll never know  
  
That it's the ocean flowing in our veins  
Oh that it's the salt that's in our tears  
Oh 'cause we could have come so very far  
Oh in at least as many years!  
  
Take the highway through the Great Divide  
Take the highway through the Great Divide  
  
I'm building you a pyramid  
With limestone blocks so large  
I drag them from the mountain top  
You'll need a two car garage  
  
And it's the ocean flowing in our veins  
Oh..That it's the salt that's in our tears  
Oh..Cause we could have come so very far  
Oh..In at least as many years  
  
Take the highway through the Great Divide  
Take the highway through the Great Divide  
  
Cause it's the ocean flowing in our veins  
Oh..That it's the salt that's in our tears  
Oh..Cause we could have come so very far  
Oh..In at least as many years  
  
Take the highway through the Great Divide

I feed from the bottom, you feed from the top  
I live upon morsels you happen to drop  
And coffee that somehow leaks out of your cup  
If nothing comes down then I'm forced to swim up  
On the way upwards, the colors come back  
But all along the bottom is blue, grey, and black  
The darkness is cold and perception goes wrong  
And the night seems to go on incredibly long  
  
So I ask you why if I'm swimming by,  
Don't you see anything you'd like to try?  
  
Pantomime mixtures of heaven and earth  
Jumbled events that have less than no worth  
Time in the forest to dig under rocks  
Or float in the ocean asleep in a box  
  
Or sink just below all the churning and froth  
And swim to the light source or fly like a moth  
So toss away stuff you don't need in the end  
But keep what's important and know who's your friend  
  
So I ask you why if I'm swimming by,  
Don't you see anything that you'd like to try?  
  
If I'm swimming by  
  
From the bottom, from the top  
From the bottom, from the top  
From the bottom, from the top  
From the bottom, from the top  
  
From the bottom, from the top  
From the bottom, from the top  
From the bottom, from the top  
From the bottom, from the top

I need a new way to express  
Myself so you don't need to guess  
What otherwise I'd say aloud  
And watch it float just like a cloud  
  
High up above you like a thunderhead  
But you would just look down instead  
And wait 'til foggy skies abate  
And water clouds all dissipate  
  
And when with them all my words for you  
Have softly sublimated too  
And you'll just hope that I've moved on  
So you'll look up and find me gone

I'm gonna pull this timber 'fore the sun go down  
Get it 'cross the river 'fore the bars come down  
Drag it on down that dusty road  
Come on Jerry, let's dump this load  
  
I said "Timber, ho!", timber, woah this timber's gotta roll  
I said "Timber, ho!", timber, woah this timber's gotta roll  
  
My old Jerry was an Arkansas mule  
Been everywhere and he ain't no fool  
Weighed nine hundred and twenty-two  
Done everything a poor mule can do  
  
(chorus)  
  
Jerry's shoulders stood six foot tall  
Pulled more timber than a freight could haul  
Workin' heavy old Jerry got sore  
Pulled so much he couldn't pull no more  
  
(chorus)  
  
The boss said "Jerry" and it made him jump  
Jerry ran and kicked the boss on the rump  
My old Jerry was a cool mule  
Had it been me I woulda killed that fool  
Boss tried to shoot old Jerry in the head  
Jerry took that bullet and he stomped him dead  
Stomped that boss til he heard him scream  
Sure don't care he was so damn mean  
  
(chorus 2x)

All the way home we felt we had a chance  
To review the coulds before we were born  
And to invite a new game of can'ts  
  
Absorbed in the clouds a voice from afar said  
"With the right device you can make a pattern grow  
Or you can tune up your car"  
  
So we stayed on the train admiring the time  
As the lights of the city drew near  
We drank a little wine  
  
They were blurry and green outer space in between  
With a depth and a form unclear  
Then we saw it up ahead  
  
A flickering lantern lit up on the tracks  
In the rugs that had covered up the bridge  
From the banks of a river to the bed  
Of the valley upstream to the place we live  
  
The glass on the lantern cast back the sight  
Of a drive-in movie we drove by below  
We saw where we'd been in the pictures within  
Projecting all the places we would go  
So we follow the scene and flowed up your steps  
To a smooth wooden floor in a trance  
The train whistle melody woved through the trees  
And in through the door to signal the turns of a dance

An asteroid crashed and nothing burned  
It made me wonder  
Do tigers sleep in lily patches?  
Do rhinos run from thunder.  
I got an ache in my left ear  
I felt the truth but I still could hear.  
Made me think, I would not be burned,  
But rather give myself to science,  
I felt that I could help  
To science, I felt that I can help  
  
Paranoid the doctor ran,  
Shouting his graphic translation  
All out of order  
Gang wars and ails of riches,  
Spewing forth their color  
He purposely waited till I was done  
To knock on the lavatory door  
Accusing me of ruining the fun,  
He knocked on it some more  
The fun, He knocked on it some more.  
  
And alloy suitors were all inside  
An apple or a grape  
To put forth a cloud of Mercury  
In front of a mighty car  
On a freeway in Los Angeles  
Once the spraying has been done  
'Cause there's more pain from necessity  
You're a portrait of your past,  
There's a mummy in the cabinet.  
Are there no more arrows left?  
  
What's that rubber bottle doing here?  
How's that napkin for a proof  
Ten cents to a dollar now  
For a shelf of pregnant hens  
  
Robert Palmer is employed  
Again, again, again  
So stupendous, living in this tube.

Too much anger trapped inside  
It's so hard to let it go  
Hope is fading  
I'm tired of waiting  
And I'm moving much too slow  
  
The stars above I'm cursing  
And it still seems I'm rehearsing  
But the cameras have been  
Rolling all the while  
This story's getting boring  
And the spectators are snoring  
I suggest you turn the dial  
  
Life is a TV show  
Should've been canceled long ago  
Life is a TV show  
Should've been canceled long ago  
Life is a TV show  
Life is a TV show  
Life is a TV show  
Should've been canceled long ago  
  
I saw a headline in the paper  
Of another ticker taper  
For a war which has barely just begun  
We'll be waving our flag silly  
As we're chopped into piccalilli  
And that's not my idea of fun  
  
Life is a TV show  
Should've been canceled long ago  
Life is a TV show  
Should've been canceled long ago  
Life is a TV show  
Life is a TV show  
Life is a TV show  
Should've been canceled long ago

Won't you step into the freezer  
Seize her with a tweezer
