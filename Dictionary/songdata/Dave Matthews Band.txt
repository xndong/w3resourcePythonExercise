Well hello there  
My it's been a long, long time.  
How ya doing? How am I doing?  
Well I guess I'm doing fine.  
But it's been so long, but it seems like  
It was only yesterday.  
  
Ain't it funny how time slips away.  
  
Well how's your new love, how's your new love.  
Well I hope he's doin fine.  
I heard you told him, I heard you said "you'd love him til the end of time"  
Now that's the same thing you told me it seems like just the other day  
  
Ain't it funny how time slips away.  
  
Well I've got to go now, I've got to go.  
Well I guess I'll see you around.  
I don't know when though, cause I don't know when I'll be back in town.  
But remember what I tell you cause in time your gonna pay.  
  
Ain't it funny how time slips away.  
Oh it's suprising how time slips away.

There must be some way out of here  
Said the joker to the thief  
There's too much confusion  
I can't get no relief  
  
Business men they  
Drink my wine  
There plowmen dig my earth  
None of them along the line  
Know what any of it's worth  
  
No reason to get excited  
The thief he kindly spoke  
There are many among us  
Who feel that life is but a joke  
  
But you and I we've been through all that, yes we have  
And this is not our fate  
So let us not talk falsely now  
The hour is getting late  
  
And all along the watchtower  
Princes kept the view  
While all the women all the women all the women came and went  
Barefoot servants too  
Outside in the cold distance  
A wild cat did growl, la la la  
Two riders, two riders approaching  
The wind began to howl  
  
The thief he take  
My money take  
The thief he take  
My money take  
  
Am I insane  
Auf wiedersehen  
Am I insane  
The thief is safe  
  
No reason to get excited

Floatin' in the lower nine  
Waitin' for a boat to throw me a line  
See my Stella smile  
Sittin' on a roof eatin' alligator pie  
First day the water rise  
Second day the sun is high  
Third day Stella cries  
'Cause night time's dark as a dead man's eyes  
  
Lord  
Tell me when help is gonna come  
Stella said Daddy, when you gonna put me in a song?  
  
Storm went right on by  
Thanked the Lord everybody's alright  
Don't mean to throw off a second line  
But the Devil broke the levee and left us here to die  
  
Stella said Daddy, when you gonna put me in a song?  
  
Like a dance hall to get y'all down  
Like a dance hall to get y'all down  
Like a dance hall to get y'all down  
  
All the things we know and everything we hope for  
All the things we wanted  
Everything that was sure  
Now there is a scar where the old men used to be  
The corner store and market where Stella used to sing to me  
Grace is all I'm asking  
When will Grace return?  
Grace is all I'm asking  
  
Remember how it feels  
Lazy days in the summertime  
Then my Stella smiled  
Stella said Daddy, when you gonna put me in a song?  
  
Tell me, Lord, when help is gonna come  
She said Daddy, when you gonna put me in a song?

Born in the springtime when blossoms unfold  
The pastures were green and the meadows were gold  
Our life was in flower as summer grew on  
And life like the leaves now has withered and gone  
  
The roses have died, there's alone  
The birds in the morning don't sing anymore  
The grass in the valley is starting to die  
And out in the darkness the whippoorwills cry  
  
Alone and forsaken by fate and by man  
Oh, Lord, if you hear me, please hold my hand  
Please understand  
  
Oh, where have you gone, where can you be  
How you forsaken some others like me  
You promised to honor, to love and obey  
As each vow was a plaything that you threw away  
  
Alone and forsaken by fate and by man  
Oh, Lord, if you hear me, please hold my hand  
  
Please understand  
  
Alone and forsaken by fate and by man  
Oh, Lord, if you hear me, please hold my hand  
Please understand  
  
The darkness is falling, the sky has turned gray  
A hound in the distance beginning to bey  
I wonder, I wonder - what she's thinking of  
Forsaken, forgotten - without any love  
  
Alone and forsaken by fate and by man  
Oh, Lord, if you hear me, please hold my hand  
Please understand  
  
Alone and forsaken by fate and by man  
Oh, Lord, if you hear me, please hold my hand  
Please understand  
  
Alone and forsaken  
Alone and forsaken  
Alone and forsaken

If these walls came crumbling down  
And fell so hard to make us lose our faith  
From what's left you'd figure it out  
Still make lemonade taste like a sunny day  
Stay beautiful baby  
I hope you stay American baby  
American baby  
Nobody?s laughing now  
God?s grace lost and the devil is proud  
But I've been walking for a thousand miles  
One last time I could see you smile  
I, I hold, hold on to you  
You bring me hope I'll see you soon  
And if I don't see you  
Oh, I'm afraid we've lost the way  
Stay beautiful baby  
I hope you stay American baby  
American baby  
American baby  
I hold on to you  
You lift me up  
And always will  
I see you in light  
Hope I don't get left behind  
I, I hold, hold on to you  
You bring me hope I'll see you soon  
And if I don't see you  
Oh, I'm afraid we've lost the way  
Stay beautiful baby  
I hope you stay American baby  
I hope you stay beautiful baby  
I hope you stay American baby  
American baby  
American baby

I call you up, you pick up.  
You call my bluff, on the cards of love.  
  
You hold too close, your hands to your chest.  
I can read your eyes, but I confess.  
  
It's lonely far from you, even when you're right by me.  
It's only while I wait for you, to take my hand  
  
Why do I beg like a child for your candy? Why do I come after you like I do?  
I love you. Whatever you are, I swear. You'll be my angel.  
You.  
  
I play my cards as best I can. But I lose my luck when you're not here.  
My darling heart, won't you please give in?  
I may be strong but I want you back again.  
  
When you're not here, oh, it's hard to pretend  
It's all alright again.  
  
When you're not here, love, it's hard to pretend It's all alright, still  
Why do I beg like a child for your candy?  
Why do I run after you like I do? I love you.  
Whatever you are I swear, you'll be my angel.  
You.  
  
Watch the day, count your cards.  
It makes no sense that I'm always losing when you're gone.  
Why do I beg like a child for your candy  
Why do I come after you like I do? I love you.  
Whatever you are I swear, you'll be my angel.  
You.  
When you're gone.

I am an old woman, named after my mother  
My old man is another, child that's grown old  
If dreams were thunder, lightning were desire  
This old house would have burnt down, a long time ago  
  
Make me an angel that flies from Montgomery  
Make me a poster from an old rodeo  
Just give me one thing that I can hold on to  
To believe in this living is just a hard way to go  
  
When I was a young girl, well I had me a cowboy  
He weren't much to look at, just a free rambling man  
But that was a long time, and no matter how I try  
The years just flow by, like a broken down dam  
  
There's flies in the kitchen, I can hear 'em there buzzing  
And I ain't done nothing, since I woke up today  
How the hell can a person, go to work in the morning  
And come home in the evening, and have nothing to say

He wakes up in the morning  
Does his teeth, bite to eat and he's rolling  
Never changes a thing  
The week ends, the week begins  
  
She thinks, we look at each other  
Wondering what the other is thinking  
But we never say a thing  
And these crimes between us grow deeper  
  
Take these chances  
Place them in a box until a quieter time  
Lights down, you up and die  
  
Goes to visit his mommy  
She feeds him well his concerns he forgets them  
And remembers being small  
Playing under the table and dreaming  
  
Take these chances  
Place them in a box until a quieter time  
Lights down, you up and die  
  
Driving along this highway  
All these cars and upon the sidewalk  
People in every direction  
No words exchanged, no time to exchange  
  
When all the little ants are marching  
Red and black antennae waving  
They all do it the same  
They all do it the same way  
  
Candyman tempting the thoughts of a sweet tooth  
Tortured by weight loss  
Program cutting corners  
Loose end, loose end  
Cut, cut on the fence not to offend  
Cut, cut, cut ,cut  
  
Take these chances  
Place them in a box until a quieter time  
Lights down, you up and die  
  
Lights down you up and die

He wakes up in the morning  
Does his teeth bite to eat and he's rolling  
Never changes a thing  
The week ends the week begins  
She thinks, we look at each other  
Wondering what the other is thinking  
But we never say a thing  
These crimes between us grow deeper

Driving in on this highway  
All these cars and upon the sidewalk  
People in every direction  
No words exchanged  
No time to exchange  
  
And all the little ants are marching  
Red and black antennas waving  
They all do it the same  
They all do it the same way  
  
Candyman tempting the thoughts of a  
Sweet tooth tortured by the weight loss  
Program cutting the corners  
Loose end, loose end, cut, cut  
On the fence, could not to offend  
Cut, cut, cut, cut  
  
Take these chances  
Place them in a box until a quieter time  
Lights down, you up and die

Baby, It's alright  
Stop your cryin' now  
  
Nothing is here to stay  
Everything has to begin and end  
A ship in a bottle won't sail  
All we can do is dream that the  
Wind will blow us across the water  
A ship in a bottle set sail  
  
Baby, It's alright  
Stop your cryin' now  
  
There was a weakling man  
Who dreamed he was strong as a hurricane  
A ship in a bottle set sail  
He took a deep breath and blew across the world  
He watched everything crumble  
Woke up a weakling again  
  
Some might tell you there's no hope in hand  
Just because they feel hopeless  
But you don't have to be a thing like that  
You'll be a ship in a bottle set sail  
  
Baby' It's alright stop your cryin' now  
It's alright so stop your cryin' now  
  
You'll be a ship in a bottle set sail

Confess, your kiss still knocks me off my legs.  
The first time I saw you was like a punch right through my chest  
And I will forever, 'cause you'll forever be  
My one true broken heart, pieces inside of me and you  
And you'll forever, my baby be.  
  
You will rest your head, your strength once saving.  
And when you wake you will fly away,  
Holding tight to the legs of all your angels.  
Goodbye my love, into your blue, blue eyes,  
Your blue, blue world, you're my baby blue.  
  
Confess I'm not quite ready to be left.  
Still, I know I gave my level best.  
You give, you give, to this I can attest  
You made me, you made me.  
You and me forever, baby.  
  
You will rest your head, your strength once saving.  
And when you wake you will fly away,  
Holding tight to the legs of all your angels.  
Goodbye my love, into your blue, blue eyes,  
In your blue, blue world, you and me forever.  
  
You will rest your head, your strength once saving.  
And when you wake you will fly away,  
Holding tight to the legs of all your angels.  
Goodbye my love, into your blue, blue eyes,  
In your blue, blue world, you and me forever.

If I go  
Before I'm old  
Oh, brother of mine  
Please don't forget me if I go

Now I can't get it out of my mind  
  
I'm on bended knees  
Father, please  
  
Oh, and if all this gold  
Should steal my soul away  
Oh, dear mother of mine  
Please redirect me if this gold  
  
Bartender, you see  
The wine that's drinking me  
Came from the vine that strung Judas from the Devil's tree  
His roots deep, deep in the ground

To fetch a pail of water.  
Jack fell down and broke his crown  
'Cause he was messing with the preacher's daughter.

Swimming in the river, rolling in the mud  
When the juice is dripping of your chin  
One peach is not enough.

So if you feel it in your belly, come on, come on  
You can't get too much love  
Oh, the time is right for loving come and get you some  
You can't get too much love

And happiness so pure as this is surely worth the making  
  
Yeah, Jack and Jill went up the hill  
To fetch a pail of water  
Jack fell down and broke his crown  
'Cause he was messing with the preacher's daughter

Would come true

And all your dreams to come true

Story of a man,  
Who decided not to breathe.

Rain in my dreams  
  
Fall away

Walking by the river's edge

He came dancing across the water  
With his galleons and guns  
Looking for the new world  
In that palace in the sun  
On the shore lay Montezuma  
With his cocoa leaves and pearls  
In his halls, he often wandered  
With the secrets of the worlds  
And his subjects gathered round him  
Like the leaves around a tree  
In their clothes of many colors  
For the angry gods to see  
And the women all were beautiful  
And the men stood straight and strong  
They offered life in sacrifice  
So that others could go on  
Hate was just a legend  
And war was never known  
The people worked together  
And they lifted many stones  
They carried them to the flatlands  
And they died along the way  
But they built up with their bare hands  
What we still can't build today  
And I know shes living there  
And she loves me to this day  
I still can't remember when  
Or how I lost my way  
Cortez, Cortez  
He came dancing across the water  
Cortez, Cortez  
What a killer

You've got your ball  
You've got your chain  
Tied to me tight tie me up again  
Who's got their claws  
In you my friend  
Into your heart I'll beat again  
Sweet like candy to my soul  
Sweet you rock  
And sweet you roll  
Lost for you I'm so lost for you  
You come crash into me  
And I come into you  
I come into you  
In a boys dream  
In a boys dream  
  
Touch your lips just so I know  
In your eyes, love, it glows so  
I'm bare-boned and crazy for you  
When you come crash  
Into me, baby  
And I come into you  
In a boys dream  
In a boys dream  
If I've gone overboard  
Then I'm begging you  
To forgive me  
In my haste  
When I'm holding you so girl  
Close to me  
  
Oh and you come crash  
Into me, baby  
And I come into you  
Hike up your skirt a little more  
And show the world to me  
Hike up your skirt a little more  
And show your world to me  
In a boys dream, in a boys dream  
  
Oh I watch you there  
Through the window  
And I stare at you  
You wear nothing but you  
Wear it so well  
Tied up and twisted  
The way I'd like to be  
For you, for me, come crash  
Into me

Crazy as I may  
Make my way  
Through this world  
It's for no one but me to say  
Which direction I should turn in  
  
Because I am the captain of this ship  
Eyes, eyelids, and kissing lips  
The same as it was  
We should be forever again  
You give  
But you don't know  
Away you give  
And you  
You give  
To roll me back again  
You give  
For me again  
You leave  
  
And people say  
Oh look at the way  
The girl dances her life away  
Oh even more then that  
All the crazy, crazy things she does  
  
She sings  
I am the captain of this ship  
Eyes, eyelids, and kissing lips  
Just the same as it was  
Away to me  
And I  
Coming back to you  
  
Why should I  
Bend myself around to make you smile  
Why should I  
Wear your blinders to give you style  
Why should I compromise my high  
So that you can  
You give and roll  
The hand is back again  
And reign me along  
You give, play  
I won't be here too long  
You give  
So wait and see  
Waiting me along  
You give the reigns  
To roll me back again  
You give  
Play me around  
You give  
And why, why  
You give, play  
Play me again  
By your side  
We're the same as we were  
And wait  
Dance, dance, do your thing  
You while away

Crazy how it feels tonight  
Crazy how you make it all alright love  
You crush me with the things you do  
I do for you anything too  
Sitting, smoking, feeling high  
In this moment it feels so right  
  
Lovely lady  
I am at your feet  
God I want you so badly  
I wonder this  
Could tomorrow be  
So wondrous as you there sleeping  
Let's go drive 'til morning comes  
  
Watch the sunrise  
To fill our souls up  
Drink some wine 'til we get drunk  
It's crazy I'm thinking  
Just knowing that the world is round  
  
Here I'm dancing on the ground  
Am I right side up or upside down  
Is this real or am I dreaming  
  
Lovely lady  
Let me drink you please  
I won't spill a drop, I promise you  
Lying under this spell you cast on me  
  
Each moment  
The more I love you  
Crush me  
Come on  
It's crazy I'm thinking  
  
Just knowing that the world is round  
Here I'm dancing on the ground  
Am I right side up or upside down  
Is it real or am I dreaming  
Lovely lady I will treat you sweetly  
  
Adore you  
I mean  
You crush me  
It's times like these  
When my faith I feel  
And I know  
How I love you  
Come on  
Lady  
  
It's crazy I'm thinking  
Just as long as you're around  
And here I'll be dancing on the ground  
Am I right side up or upside down  
To each other we'll be facing  
By love we'll beat back the pain  
  
We've found  
You know  
I mean to tell you all the things I've been thinking deep inside  
My friend  
With each moment the more I love you  
Crush me  
Come on  
Lady  
  
So much you have given love  
That I would give you back  
Again and again  
Meaning I'll hold you  
And please  
Let me always

I met a girl named Tara  
She lived in the heart of america  
She liked black caddies  
Listened to puff daddy  
Danced until her legs were sore  
  
She worked around the corner  
At the diner with the grouchy owner  
And her boyfriends shady, dates another girl named katie  
He loves her definately maybe  
  
Don't think I can take it  
Wake me when its over  
So far away  
I wish that it was closer  
I see you every day  
I'm too scared to go over  
I wonder what she'd say  
I barely even know her  
  
Chorus:  
And how much longer  
Will this keep getting stronger  
I wonder what shes doing when I'm singing myself to sleep  
Cause hes a faker  
So see ya later  
I wonder when you realize that she means a lot more to me  
  
I saw you in the hallway when my last class was just over  
It was friday, school was out tonight  
Everything seems to be allright  
I said yo are you going to the party at the cove  
Hes picking me up six again and I don't wanna disappoint my boyfriend  
  
And shes staring at his picture hanging in her locker  
Shes telling all the girls about all the things that he bought her  
I saw what really happened all those times he went for water  
When we were at the movie theatre watching harry potter  
He had his hands on  
Every single girl he laid his eyes on  
Hate to break it to you, hes a pylon  
And even when he kissed her  
He was looking over, staring at her sister

I saw a man on the side of the road  
With a sign that read 'will work for food'  
Tried to look busy, 'til the light turned green  
  
I saw a bear on TV and his friends were all drowning  
Cause their homes were turning to water  
  
A strange, kinda sad, big old bear  
Surely would happily eat me  
He'd tear me to pieces that bear  
  
Wake up sleepy head  
I think the suns a little brighter today  
Smile and watch the icicles melt away and see the water rising...  
Summers here to stay, and all those summer games will last forever  
Go down to the shore, kick off your shoes, dive in the empty ocean.  
  
Tell me everything will be OK if I just stay on my knees and keep praying  
Believing in something  
Tell me everything is all taken care  
Of by those qualified to take care of it all  
  
Wake up sleepy head  
I think the suns a little brighter today  
Smile and watch the icicles melt away and see the waters rising  
Summers here to stay, and that sweet summer breeze will blow forever  
Go down to the shore, kick off your shoes, dive in the empty ocean  
  
One day, do you think we'll wake up in a world on it's way to getting better?  
And if so can you tell me  
How?  
  
I have been thinking that lately the blood is increasing  
The tourniquets not keeping hold in spite of our twisting  
Though we would like to believe we are  
We are not in control  
Though we would love to believe  
  
Wake up sleepy head  
I think the suns a little brighter today  
Smile and watch the icicles melt away and see the water rising...  
Summers here to stay, and those sweet summer girls will dance forever  
Go down to the shore, kick off your shoes, dive in the empty ocean.

Once upon a time  
When the world was just a pancake  
Fears would arise  
That if you went too far you'd fall  
But with the passage of time  
It all became more of a ball.  
We're as sure of that  
As we all once were when the world was flat  
  
So I wonder this  
As life billows smoke inside my head  
This little game where nothing is sure, oh  
Why would you play by the rules?  
Who did, you did, you  
Who did, you did, you  
  
When was she killed  
The very last dodo bird  
And was she aware  
She was the very last one  
  
So I wonder this  
As life billows smoke inside my head  
This little game where nothing is sure, oh  
Why would you play by the rules?  
Who did, you did, you  
Who did, you did, you  
You say who did, well you did, you  
  
If all the things that you are saying love  
Were true enough but still  
What is all the worrying about  
When you can work it out  
When you can work it  
  
Oh I wonder this  
As life billows smoke inside my head  
This little game where nothing is sure  
Why would you play by the rules?  
Who did, you did, you  
Who did, you did, you  
You say who did, well you did, it's you

Come out come out  
No use in hiding  
Come out come out  
Can you not see  
There's no place here  
What were you expecting  
No room for both  
Just room for me  
So you lay your arms down  
Yes I will call this home  
  
Away away  
You have been banished  
Your land is gone and given me  
And here I will spread my wings  
Yes I will call this home  
What's this you say  
You feel the right to remain  
Then stay and I will bury you  
What's that you say  
Your father's spirit still lives in this place  
I will silence you  
  
Here's the hitch  
Your horse is leaving  
Don't miss the boat  
It's leaving now  
And as you go I will spread my wings  
Yes I will call this home  
I have no time to justify to you  
Fool you're blind, move aside from me  
All I can say to you my new neighbor  
Is you must move on or I will bury you  
  
Now as I rest my feet by this fire  
Those hands once warmed here  
I have retired them  
I can breathe my own air  
And I can sleep more soundly  
Upon these poor souls  
I'll build heaven and call it home  
  
Cause you're all dead now  
I live with my justice  
I live with my greedy need  
I live with no mercy  
I live with my frenzied feeding  
I live with my hatred  
I live with my jealousy  
I live with the notion  
That I don't need anyone but me  
Don't drink the water  
There's blood in the water.

Dream I killed God and woke up  
Dream I killed God and woke up  
He's begging "please, please, please."  
"no, don't...."  
  
Dream I killed God and woke up  
Time dries, time dries my mind  
Oh, I'll survive, no one can save us  
Talk to myself, talk to my soul  
  
I want you to follow  
Yes, follow...  
It's only... It's only a dream, only  
  
Dream I killed God and woke up  
He was lying, bleeding and wishing  
  
It's passing  
It's passing  
Dream I killed god  
Dream I killed god  
Is he dead?  
And then I dreamt of him

Oh, I'm choking, I'm choking  
On the smoke from this burning house  
I claw and I scrape  
But I can't seem to get out  
But who then, who is this  
That's scratching from the ground  
Oh, it's my world too  
But who's gold is this I'm digging out?  
  
Where we go, when we go  
When we're dead  
Is the verdict still out?  
Do we get into line  
To line up with those long dead now?  
With the muffled tears of sorrow  
Bones underground  
Is this time our time?  
Yes, it is  
Without of with this shadow of doubt.  
  
I don't want to wake up  
Lost in the dreams of our fathers.  
Oh, it's such a waste, child  
To live and die for the dreams of our fathers  
Though I must confess, yes  
My view is a wonder about this  
This love I possess, love  
It must be the dreams of our fathers.  
  
I want to go, I want to run  
We turn, so sure someone's looking down  
It's haunting me, haunting me  
Leaves us here to get out  
Though I don't believe, I don't believe  
This flavor in my mouth  
Is from my tongue alone  
So bitter, I want to spit it out.  
  
I repeat these words  
They come out  
Under the blue light in the sky  
My empty pages are filling up  
With these wicked lies  
But I hear deep in myself  
An echo, an echo  
Of empty, empty emptiness  
Comes up and swells inside.  
  
I don't want to wake up  
Lost in the dreams of our fathers  
Oh, its such a waste, child  
To live and die for the dreams of our fathers  
Though I must confess, yes  
My view is a wonder about this  
This love I possess, love  
It must be the dreams of our fathers  
  
Rain on my head  
Rain on my head  
Rain on me  
And then give me air  
Rain on my love  
Again and again  
Why can't I dream you away from me?  
  
Look here, look here  
Bloated, floating  
Go belly down  
Belly up in the water  
But who is this here that's drowned?  
We followed a drunken man  
He got us all spinning round  
But it's like he swallowed himself  
And didn't leave us a way out  
  
I don't want to wake up  
Lost in the Dreams of our Fathers  
Oh, it's such a shame, child  
To live and die for the Dreams of our Fathers  
Though I must confess, yes  
My view is a wonder about this  
This love I possess, love  
It must be the Dreams of our Fathers  
  
This love I possess, love  
It must be the Dreams of our Fathers  
This love I possess, love  
It must be the Dreams of our Fathers  
This love I possess, love  
It must be the love of our fathers  
  
The dreams  
The dreams  
The dreams  
This love I possess love

I hear more than I like to...  
So I boil my head in a sense of humor...  
I laugh at what I cannot change...  
I throw it all on the pyre again...go then and do this  
I'd do it for you...  
When all that I want is so badly to be...  
By myself again...  
It's going to drive me right out of my brain  
  
Drive in drive out I'm leaving  
Drive in drive out  
I'll come back again  
Drive in drive out I'm leaving  
Drive in drive out  
  
I don't care if we all turn to waste...  
So when I beg...you avoid me...because I smell of dirt...hungry,  
Hungry boy...you won't leave me all alone...the boy won't go  
  
Sooner or later we're done  
Sooner or later I'm gone  
Because, because  
Sooner or later we're gone  
Sooner away  
  
Ooh, my head is pounding now...god has all but left me behind...  
Not a sense of worry...I'm going to drive in and drive out again  
Drive in drive out I'm leaving  
Drive in drive out I'll come  
Drive in drive out I'm leaving  
Drive in drive out  
  
I'm over this arrangement...  
Around here...emptiness  
Sounded so good...I want to  
Drive you right into my world  
  
Drive in drive out I'm leaving  
Drive in drive out I'll come  
Drive in drive out I'm leaving  
Drive in drive out

Pick me up, love!

Hey, how long, how long, how long (Everyday)

Everyday

I must admit  
I can't remember your name  
I know we just met,  
But since then I've had a lot to think about  
Before we part ways, well, there's something that I'd like to say  
I realize it's late  
But if you'll hear out I'm sure  
Dave Letterman can wait  
And if you'd like to  
Maybe continue, what we started with a smile  
From across the room  
That'd be fine with me  
When I first saw  
  
Your face, I knew for sure  
That from now on  
Things would be different than before  
I walk in weak  
From yet another day  
I need you to say  
That tomorrow I'm gonna hear your voice again  
And if you'd like to, maybe continue,  
What we started with a smile from across the room  
That'd be fine with me  
And I only hope that I can be what you were looking for  
Cause all I ask is that you look my way  
And that'd be fine with me  
I know it's clich

With fire to keep us warm  
And tools we made from rocks and bones  
A roof over your head  
And walls to keep you safe in bed  
  
There must be more than this  
So god was born and we in his  
Image of fear and love  
Looked down upon from up above  
  
We gotta do much more than believe if we really wanna change things  
We gotta do much more than believe if we wanna see the world change  
  
We crossed the oceans wide  
Built cities to the sky (oh lord)  
Looked up and we were flying  
But will we not survive ourselves  
  
We gotta do much more than believe if wanna see the world change  
We gotta do much more than believe if we really wanna change things  
We gotta do much more than believe, go on try it, go on try it  
We gotta do much more than believe if we wanna see the world change  
  
What will I say to baby?  
Let me show you a movie  
You know we landed a man on the moon?  
Now you could never believe it  
Yea we could do anything  
We flew to the stars and back  
Down to the ground hard  
  
Please wake up  
Please wake up  
Please wake up  
  
We gotta do much more than believe if we really wanna change things  
We gotta do much more than believe, go on try it, go on try it  
We gotta do much more than believe if we really wanna change things  
We gotta do much more than believe, go on try it, go on try it  
We gotta do much more than believe if we wanna see the world change  
  
Oh, my little baby  
I'll show you this movie  
You know we landed a man on the moon?  
  
I know its hard to imagine  
But we could do anything  
Under the stars

Hey  
Mama took everything  
See you change and leaving  
Come on, come on, baby, yeah  
Telling go with you  
Man, he don't call back  
I'm worried, worried  
Take him, take my time to go  
And I wonder and I'm happy well say  
  
Yeah, I'm coming  
Oh aren't, oh aren't you  
Yeah, Tired  
And write you, and write you  
  
Yeah, and leave me i'll turn you away  
Like a fool  
More happy than sad and again  
I'm in a hurry, oh  
Please don't go away  
By the colors out of place  
Please don't hurry  
Turn your back  
Back outside  
  
Yeah, You come  
Oh where, oh where  
Oh and i tell him, tell him get in line  
Oh calling stand again  
Watch him, watch him as he smiles  
You never can tell it's coming  
And i don't want to wonder again  
I'm begging you for a female (Sounds like female, at least)  
Taking, taking all my time  
How old and lay asleep  
  
Oh yeah  
I'm coming  
Oh aren't, oh aren't you  
Yeah, I'm running for ya to, for ya  
  
Yeah, and scurries  
And I mind  
I don't, I don't  
  
Yeah, leave me back home to my trance  
And I'm saying it  
Oh, baby  
I'm too worried for my health  
And the reasons change  
Please don't forget  
To turn me back  
Like a (?)  
Please don't worry  
Our lover yeah  
  
Yeah, I scream and say  
Yeah, turning back, turning back  
  
Oh yeah  
Come and turn back the screen  
And it's open  
Yeah  
Darkness it needs me again  
Please don't worry  
About the colors 'round your eyes  
Just because  
What lies inside the smile  
  
Oh yeah  
Lover lie, lover lie  
My running, feet too fast  
Well I run back and call it an answer  
Come on, come on give me time  
And i receive  
And i don't even question why  
I say I'll come again  
I say I'll come again

It's been three nights or so, since I last slept.  
Just thinking about the promises you never kept.  
And all the times I tried so hard to leave.  
In response to words I never could believe.  
  
They told me you're crazy,  
They said that you've lost your mind.  
And I've got no reason,  
To think otherwise.  
You told me you loved me,  
But I guess that you told me lies.  
Now I see the real you,  
That hides behind your deep blue eyes.  
  
Wait,  
And all our time has seemed to fade.  
In the end your colors changed.  
And we're now getting over.  
  
Here's all the pictures you never wanted to take.  
With your toothless smile that always seemed so fake.  
And all the notes you wrote when you got bored.  
I don't think I need to read them anymore.  
  
It's all to confusing,  
When I don't know where to begin.  
It'd almost be easy,  
If only we could pretend.  
But how could I feel you,  
When you'd never let me in.  
And how am I to know where you're coming from.  
If you never tell me where you'd been.  
  
Wait,  
And all our time has seemed to fade.  
In the end your colors changed.  
And we're now getting over.  
  
Lie for a lie.  
But I'm not the unforgiving type.  
It'll probably just take a while.  
Wait for me to get my feet grounded.  
Find the love that you never found in me.  
I find love on my feet, in places you'll never be.  
Wait til' I find my place in the sky and finally see through my clear eyes,  
I soon will realize it's time for me to say good-bye.  
  
You told me you loved me,  
But I guess that you told me lies.  
I'm so sick of the real you,  
That hides behind your deep blue eyes.  
They told me you're crazy,  
They said that you've lost your mind.  
And you have showed me nothing,  
To prove them otherwise.  
  
Wait,  
And all our time has seemed to fade.  
In the end your colors changed.  
And we're now getting over.  
Again,  
Looking back on time we'd spent.  
It's funny to remember when  
We used to be together.

Don't it sometimes feel  
As if the world is turned upside down.  
We're all standing on our heads.  
Tryin' to make the most of this,  
Kinda makes it feel like your heavy.  
  
Don't it sometimes feel like you got too much to bear.  
Well let it at the door my friend,  
Come inside and let's have a good good  
Good good time tonight  
Try forget it all  
'Cause it will still be there tomorrow,  
You can be sure, it will still be there for us all.  
  
Let's have a good good time tonight  
That's what I preach, yeah.  
You can leave the problems out  
We come back to teach about  
The fun I like good good time  
Nobody be there by my side  
Close your eyes, shake it up, shake it up.  
Baby ya look good tonight  
It's a good good time tonight, yeah  
  
Stumble self down, fall down,  
Scrape your knee, rub it good.  
You wake up with your head feels like,  
Someone's beatin' on you.  
End of story  
But overboard, overboard  
Just for this evening  
Leave it behind, leave it behind,  
Let's dance the night away.  
  
Let's have a good good time tonight  
Hope ya can if ya will.  
Try to leave your tears after all  
Bring 'em in to show everyone  
We can get to the bottom of this bottle  
We could end of this burning toll  
Roll up now, roll it up another one,  
And another fall through before.  
Let's have a good good time tonight  
  
It's a good good time tonight  
It's a good good time tonight  
It's a good good time tonight  
It's a good good time tonight

Neon shines through smokey eyes tonight  
It's 2 A. M. I'm drunk again  
And it's heavy on my mind  
  
I could never love again  
So much as I love you  
Where you end, where I begin  
Is like a river running through  
  
Take my eyes, take my heart  
I need them no more  
If never again I fall upon the one I so adore  
  
[Chorus:]  
Excuse me please, one more drink  
Could you make it strong  
Cause I don't need to think  
She broke my heart  
My grace is gone  
One more drink and I'll move on  
  
One drink to remember  
Then another to forget  
How could I ever dream to find  
Sweet love like you again  
One drink to remember  
Then another to forget  
  
Excuse me please, one more drink  
Could you make it strong  
Cause I don't need to think  
She broke my heart  
My grace is gone  
One more drink and I'll move on  
One more drink and I'll be gone  
  
You think of things impossible  
Then the sun refuse to shine  
I walk with you beside me  
Your cold hand lay in mine  
  
Excuse me please, one more drink  
Could you make it strong  
Cause I don't need to think  
She broke my heart  
My grace is gone  
One more drink and I'll go  
Excuse me please, one more drink  
Could you make it strong  
Cause I don't need to think  
She broke my heart  
My grace is gone  
One more drink and I'll move on  
One more drink and I'll be gone  
One more drink my grace is gone  
...(classic Dave mumbling)...

I fade from the light  
Your glory was lost that night  
And no mind can't get me right  
And now I'm praying that you'll find me out  
Stone, stone has pulled me down  
But my faith has got me bound to your grey blue eyes  
Oh, oh  
Oh, oh  
  
Don't forget my broken heart  
You remember it from the start  
You made it and it's all a part  
Of your grey blue eyes  
Oh, oh  
Oh, oh  
  
You're gone and I know I'm dead  
I've lost my way  
Can't find me in your grey blue eyes  
Grey blue eyes  
Grey blue eyes  
Grey blue eyes

Oh, just sitting while she listens  
She says I don't need this place  
It seems a million years she's stuck here  
But says nothing of what she thinks  
  
She thinks, hey,  
How did I come to this?  
I dreamt like anybody else one night  
I would be a beautiful princess.  
  
But then the roads in the park fall  
And then she rode the line in  
And the colors mix together to grey  
And break me out  
  
Oh, when I'm indifferent  
She prays to God most every night  
Although she swears he doesnt't't listen  
There's hope in her that he just might  
  
She says, I pray  
But then my prayer fall on deaf ears  
I'm supposed to take it all myself  
To get out of this place.  
  
She feels the lumps in the heart fall  
And she rose up in the back  
She hears the cars scream out from outside  
And she whispers sometimes about this  
But the colors mix together to grey  
And wake me up  
  
Oh, he grows up living  
He says take what you can from your dreams  
Make them real as anything  
It takes the work out of the courage  
  
She said, please,  
There's a crazy man standing outside my door  
I live on the corner of a dead end street  
At the end of the world.  
  
Oh, and the rocks out in the heart fall  
And she dreams her way to life  
And she knows no one will lift her  
So she might as well do it herself  
  
And then bummed out and worried  
Of leaving city life  
But all the colors mix together to grey  
On grey street  
On grey street  
To grey street  
  
Oh, when it comes down in your loving  
Oh, well then baby it's right  
You say you think you are nothing  
No one else will do it for you  
Reach up and grab hold of the sunlight  
When you are waiting for what's right  
Youre holding on your heaven  
Wont leave you, yeah, yeah...  
  
And the colors mix together to grey  
Wake me up, wake me up, wake me up  
To grey.

I won't be so what will we wait  
And our reasons sew away  
Then we crawl out of our holes into the open air  
Take us so long we cried away  
In corners they may feel  
But oh no what I see  
But I know it's not fair  
Baby say you love me  
And don't leave her waiting  
By the any one word  
You call me up and say a lie  
So child take'em I call to come again  
And now I'm watching you  
Why and it's all into the old way back  
We swing our hands and hope  
That everyone comes back  
I don't believe you're saying  
I don't believe what you're doing here  
Tell me good intentions  
And what you hang from your tree  
I don't believe what you said  
But walkin by my door  
I find all these smilin' faces  
Locked up and tied  
Oh the rhythm, an old song I heard  
Wild and afraid I'll sail away again  
Memories fall  
Hey we feel so cold  
I really thought it was cool winter day  
Not to buy  
We buy the air down the wall  
Say this one time  
We all, they could do it for a week or more  
Then they wait and buy it  
I don't care no matter what  
I will mend me one too  
Pour the soul out in an open page  
Crushed by our memories  
So my happiness fell away  
And tore my mind and darkness fell here

My head won't leave me crying  
And I lay this one  
She won't give me happy  
As I lie here alone  
My own will give you baby  
  
Call again  
Let me be the number  
You lead me away again  
It was anything I need to  
Find my way through this sand [?]  
My baby lead my head away  
And calling by my head.  
  
Boy  
When you away we go  
Sending me crawling back over  
And crawl back to say  
  
My head, my head won't rely  
On the troubles today  
And my leave my head in worry  
Like the summer rolls  
My own won't leave me happy  
Don't make me give it back  
And on we will go  
  
And have you called me there way before  
And I leave this song with you  
Feeling colder  
Than I ever have  
She won't be my lady  
And some of you fall  
  
And I give you happy  
Fools you know  
My mind is wide and away  
And for well it's gone  
And only leave me happy  
You wouldn't make me fall  
  
And when we call  
Maybe, baby say  
And you call  
I don't know again  
Say too much...

Oh great light, of love  
Oh great light, of love  
Oh great light, of love  
Oh great light, of love  
  
Here you go the dirty girl  
Good, God, try to love to try to ahh

Cross your heart, and hope to die  
You know I'd love to.

And when I go down for you  
I want to blow your mind  
  
You and I, uh, uh

And when I go down for you

You, you, hey yeah  
You, you, not I  
You, you oh

I'm mixing up a bunch of magic stuff  
A magic mushroom cloud of care  
A potion that will rock the boat will rock  
Make a bomb of love and blow it up  
  
I did it  
Do you think I've gone too far  
I did it  
Guilty as charged  
I did it  
It was me right or wrong  
I did it Yeah  
  
I never did a single thing that did a single thing to  
Change the ugly ways of the world  
I didn't know it felt so right inside  
I didn't know at all  
Open up the curtains I heard sirens there the lights flash and crawl  
I did it justice I just did it for us all  
  
It's a nickel or a dime for what I've done  
The truth is that I don't really care  
For such a lovely crime I'll do the time  
You better lock me up I'll do it again  
  
I did it  
Do you think I've gone too far  
I did it  
Guilty as charged  
I did it  
It was me right or wrong  
I did it  
Yeah  
  
I never did a single thing that did a single thing to  
Change the ugly ways of the world  
I didn't know it felt so right inside  
I didn't know at all  
Open up the curtains I heard sirens there the lights flash and crawl  
I did it justice I just did it for the buzz  
  
All you people are the skewers of our dreams  
Like the cat that collared me  
Oh what I gotta say to you got love don't  
Turn it down  
Turn it loud  
Let it build  
We got a long way to go  
But you gotta start somewhere  
Go door to door spread the love you got  
You got the love  
You get what you want  
Does it matter where you get it from  
I for one  
Don't turn my cheek for anyone  
Unturn your cheek to give your love  
Love to grow  
  
I did it  
Do you think I've gone too far  
I did it  
Guilty as charged  
I did it  
  
Was me right or wrong  
I did it  
Yeah

Guilty as charged

Change the ugly ways of the world  
I didn't know it felt so right inside  
I didn't know at all  
Open up the curtain I heard sirens there the lights flash and crawl  
I did it justice I just did it for us all

If I had a boat  
I'd go out on the ocean  
And if I had a pony  
I'd ride him on my boat  
And we could all together  
Go out on the ocean  
Me upon my pony on my boat  
  
If I were Roy Rogers  
I'd sure enough be single  
I couldn't bring myself to marrying old Dale  
It'd just be me and trigger  
We'd go riding through them movies  
Then we'd buy a boat and on the sea we'd sail  
  
And if I had a boat  
I'd go out on the ocean  
And if I had a pony  
I'd ride him on my boat  
And we could all together  
Go out on the ocean  
Me upon my pony on my boat  
  
The mystery masked man was smart  
He got himself a Tonto  
'Cause Tonto did the dirty work for free  
But Tonto he was smarter  
And one day said kemo sabe  
Kiss my ass I bought a boat  
I'm going out to sea  
  
And if I had a boat  
I'd go out on the ocean  
And if I had a pony  
I'd ride him on my boat  
And we could all together  
Go out on the ocean  
Me upon my pony on my boat  
  
And if I were like lightning  
I wouldn't need no sneakers  
I'd come and go wherever I would please  
And I'd scare 'em by the shade tree  
And I'd scare 'em by the light pole  
But I would not scare my pony on my boat out on the sea  
  
And if I had a boat  
I'd go out on the ocean  
And if I had a pony  
I'd ride him on my boat  
And we could all together  
Go out on the ocean  
Me upon my pony on my boat

Sometimes I can't move my feet it seems  
As if I'm stuck in the ground somehow like a tree  
As if I can't even breathe  
And my screams come whispering out  
As if nobody can even see me  
Like a ghost  
I can't see myself sometimes  
  
Then again if I were a king  
If I had everything  
If I had you  
And I could give you your dreams  
If I were giant size  
On top of it all  
Tell me what in the world would I sing for  
If I had it  
  
Sometimes I feel lost  
As I pull you out like strings of memories  
Wish I could weave them into you  
And I could figure the whole damn puzzle out  
  
But then again if I were a king  
If I had everything  
If I had you  
And I could give you your dreams  
If I were giant size  
On top of it all  
Tell me then what I would sing for  
If I had it all  
  
Oh  
I could take anything  
If I had no greed to big  
Just poison tainting the green  
  
Remembering time  
Much younger than me now  
When my breath was light  
When the world raised me kind  
Here the mother comforts child  
Every moment was waking up  
But now I have grown tired  
  
If I had it all  
Oh I'd fuck it up sure  
  
If I were a king  
If I had everything  
If I had you  
And I could give you your dreams  
If I were giant size  
On top of it all  
Tell me what in the world would I sing for  
  
If I were a king  
If I had everything  
Piece by piece  
If had you  
If I could give you your dreams  
If I were giant size  
On top of it all  
Then why in the world would I sing  
If I had it all

When was the point that you showed-  
Move on to another love  
Laughing with kindness  
When did you decide to break  
How much more will it take for two people to be happy?  
But you lied  
Looked me straight in the eye  
As if you had nothing to hide  
With no shame  
As if we were still the same  
But now I'm back in the game  
I'm over you  
  
When did you decide to go?  
Were you ever going to let me know?  
I was deciding  
When did you decide to change?  
What did I do that made our situation weary?  
  
When you lied  
You looked me straight in the eye  
As if you had nothng to hide  
With no shame  
As if we still were the same  
But now I'm back in the game  
I'm over you  
  
Who was the one to tell?  
I thought I knew you way too well  
But I didn't  
The thought of you thinking of him  
Assumptions made on a whim  
Drives me crazy  
  
'Cause you lied  
Looked me staight in the eye  
As if you had nothing to hide  
(But I know you did)  
With no shame  
As if we still were the same  
But now I"m back in the game  
I'm Over you

There are places I remember all my life,  
Though some have changed,  
Some forever, not for better,  
Some have gone and some remain.  
  
All these places had their moments  
With lovers and friends I still can recall.  
Some are dead and some are living.  
In my life I've loved them all.  
  
But of all these friends and lovers,  
There is no one compares with you,  
And these memories lost their meaning  
When I think of love as something new.  
  
Though I know I'll never lose affection  
For people and things that went before,  
I know I'll often stop and think about them,  
In my life I'll love you more.  
  
Though I know I'll never lose affection  
For people and things that went before,  
I know I'll often stop and think about them,  
In my life I'll love you more.  
In my life I'll love you more.

Ten years ago, on a cold dark night  
Someone was killed, 'neath the town hall light  
There were few at the scene, but they all agreed  
That the slayer who ran, looked a lot like me  
  
The judge said son, what is your alibi  
If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die  
I spoke not a word, thou it meant my life  
For I'd been in the arms of my best friend's wife  
  
She walks these hills in a long black veil  
She visits my grave when the night winds wail  
Nobody knows, nobody sees  
Nobody knows but me  
  
Oh, the scaffold is high and eternity's near  
She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear  
But late at night, when the north wind blows  
In a long black veil, she cries ov're my bones

If I had the world to make a day for you  
I'd fill each hour with praises and shower you  
If I held the sun inside my hands  
I'd shine it bright inside your heart  
  
And I'd turn my praise and focus to the thought of you  
And stand you there  
A statue in my soul forever  
  
I dreamed I saw you dancing and I joined you there  
And spun we did in the moon's warm light  
  
Know I dreamed that they take away everything that you held close and
sorrowful for  
I will love you like no man can and we will dance at the ide of love  
I'll take the moon I'll take the sun from the starry sky  
And decorate your nights with light and shadow like no other can, bright  
  
I will dream of stealing you from all the things that bother and hurt you  
You my love and only love alone  
  
If I could make another day for you  
And shadows taken all of you, and shadows taken all of you  
And I can see my heart beat louder and my face grow warm  
Each time you stand by me my only love, ray on me  
  
So if you your man and family do remember this the time we only caught short
view  
Of each other while in some it shine  
I will rake in each day and sell it to you  
And sell it to you and sell it to you my love  
  
No captain but you my love  
No king but you

No, no, Mama, now Devil done do-si-do  
Two young boys lyin' dead by the side of the road  
And the coins in their eyes represent the money they owe  
No judge or jury ever gonna hear the story told  
  
Down by the bayou  
Tryin' to play with the 'caine  
Tryin' to play with the 'caine  
Same old story again  
(Louisiana bayou) Down by the bayou  
Tryin' to play with the 'caine  
Tryin' to play with the 'caine  
Same old story again  
Louisiana bayou  
  
Sweet girl, daddy done beat that girl like he's insane

Oh it's a shame to lose your way as a child  
Oh it's a shame to lose your  
  
Money on the bed, but you ain't got to go

Where you are that's where I want to be  
And through your eyes are all the things I want to see  
In the night you are my dreams  
You're everything to me  
  
You're the love  
Of my life  
And the breath  
In my prayers  
Take my hand  
Lead me there  
What I need is you here  
  
I can't forget the taste of your mouth  
From your lips, the heavens pour out  
I can't forget when we are one  
You alone and I am free  
  
Everyday, every night  
You alone, are the love of my life  
  
Everyday, every night  
You, alone, are the love of my life  
  
We go dancing in the moonlight  
With the starlight in your eyes  
We go dancing 'til the sunlight  
You and me, we're gonna  
Dance, dance, dance

Spring sweet rhythm dance in my head  
Slip into my lover's hands  
Kiss me won't you kiss me now  
And sleep I would inside your mouth  
Don't be us too shy  
For knowing it's no big surprise that  
I will wait for you  
I will wait for no one but you  
  
Oh please lover lay down  
Spend this time with me  
Together share this smile  
Lover lay down  
Spend this time with me  
Walk with me, walk with you  
Hold my hand your hands  
So much we have dreamed  
And you were so much younger  
Hard to explain that we are stronger  
A million reasons life to deny  
Let's toss them away  
See you and me we  
Lay down look see  
She and he  
By my lover's side  
Together share this smile  
Each other's tears to cry  
Together share this smile  
Lover lay down  
Oh please oh please  
Oh please lover lay down  
Oh please lover lay down  
And you weep  
Lover lay down  
Cause it's over  
Lover lay down  
  
Say love, say love, say love, say love, say love  
Should I love you  
Could you love me  
Darling it's all the same  
'Til we dance away  
Chasing me all around  
Leading me all around  
Leading me all around in circles  
Say...

Great monkey man has gone the distance,  
The lucky one's going to get it.  
Loving life now,  
Living on top of.  
Lucky ones always get it all.  
  
Oh, I'm hungry,  
Don't wanna die like a little dog.  
Gonna take what I can get,  
I'm the monkey man,  
With the great, great monkey plan.  
  
It's crazy, crazy, little man,  
You've got yourself entangled.  
  
Oh, love to lie to myself,  
To say everything is fine now.  
We got to keep it up,  
Or fall behind.  
I got to keep it up,  
Or lose the edge we found faster.  
I'll build higher, still higher,  
I dig deeper down,  
Til it's down in the ground.  
It's found, used up and then thrown out.  
  
Crazy, crazy little man,  
What do you think you're doing here?  
  
Big, beautiful world just for us,  
Good use we must put it to.  
Any way I can think to use it up,  
What will I tell my grandson's grandsons?  
  
I could weave a fairy tale,  
On a great bible-thumping scale.  
When he stands empy hands,  
On his empty land,  
That's what happened here.  
Great, great monkey man.  
  
Where did you think grey was the color of this?  
You think I don't know quite what to say?  
But I'm worried for myself in this.  
  
I'm hungry,  
Don't wanna die like a little dog.  
Well, I eat what I can get,  
From the monkey man.  
Great, great monkey man.  
Great, great monkey plan.  
  
Crazy, crazy man,  
You get yourself turned in a pickle.  
  
Crazy, crazy monkey man,  
Who is the one in the middle?  
  
Take a walk,  
Cross the ice,  
Melts too quickly for us to reach the other side.  
  
It's cold in here,  
But the sun shines bright.  
Oh, it warms this up well,  
Oh, the tide is rising higher.  
  
Look, it's strange,  
Floating by.  
Looks just like the ones,  
That flow out and ride, oh, I will.  
  
Golden age,  
These golden times,  
Our golden days seem to have us,  
Hypnotized or blind, well.

Mother Father please explain to me  
Why the world's so full of mystery  
A place so bitter and still so sweet  
So beautiful and yet so full of sad, sad  
  
Mother Father please explain to me  
Why forests march to deserts be  
Why snow capped mountains melt away  
What do we tell our babies, what do we say  
Oh  
  
Mother Father please explain to me  
How a man rocks his child to sleep  
Pulls the trigger on his brother's heart  
He digs a hole right to the middle of his storm of hatred  
  
Mother Father please explain to me  
How it could be so this world has come to be  
A precious balance in between  
Such cruelty and such kind  
Please, please  
  
Mother Father please explain to me  
How this world has come to be  
Unequaled in her blessings, oh I see  
Unbridled hatred so extreme  
Please tell me  
  
Mother Father please explain to me  
How this world has come to be so  
Twisted between time and dreams  
Oh Mother Father please explain to me  
  
Oh what's all this talk about  
All this talk about it  
Spilling down, down, down, down, down  
All this talk about  
Endless words without  
Nothings done  
  
Mother Father do you know  
Why one man's belly overflows  
Another sleeps in hunger's bed  
Oh, we trade our world for a piece of bread  
Oh  
  
Mother Father please explain to me  
How this rare world's come to be  
A place so full of color  
and yet overflowing always in black and white  
Drowning in the waters of our  
  
Mother Father please explain to me  
How this world has come to be  
But still blessed in all the things we see  
Such a sad, sad home for you and me  
  
C'mon, adult  
C'mon not you, c'mon not you  
Come a save yourself  
C'mon I'll do  
  
C'mon, we're taken on water  
We're taken on water, we're taken on water  
But you know  
We got the freedom!  
We got the freedom!  
There's no god above and no hell below  
It's here with us, It's up to us  
To keep afloat  
  
How this sweet world has come to be  
Oh, to keep afloat  
  
Mother Father please explain to me!  
How this rare world has come to be  
Oh, the blue planet, the blue planet  
Mother Father please explain to me  
  
Mother Father please explain

When you hold my hand time stands still  
When the love in my pain fills my heart  
It's your love that heals  
  
When I'm feeling this feeling inside  
I know that it's true  
That every single beat of my heart  
Is beating for you  
  
My heart is yours and my love is too  
And I love you with all of my heart  
Which belongs to you  
  
When your stuck and cold  
And loving moves in  
And love is shining bright as the sun  
Gives my soul from a veil  
  
That every little kiss from your lips  
Takes my breath away  
And it's right here  
By your side I will always stay  
  
My heart is yours  
It's where you'll be  
Your the only love of my life  
Your everything to me  
  
My heart is yours  
Is where you'll be  
Your the only love of my life  
Your everything to me  
  
If I love you with all of my heart  
Which belongs to you

Share the time again  
I spend with you  
A friend is always good to have  
But a lover's kiss is better than angels raining down at me  
I dream of you at times when you're by my side  
Dream you're not just like you are  
So troubled and doubling my pain  
Just one more tear  
You she'd for me  
I wish I could climb inside your mind  
And spend some time and hug and hold you  
And mold you into what I'd like  
But no I can't do this  
Just a kiss to spend a while by you  
And your familiar smile and voice  
  
I lay awake  
Then you lean back and smiling  
On you  
Most everything you do for me, I say  
And the while let's make our way  
And feel warm  
In the middle of this storm with you  
Like an angel  
  
Oh, what the friends say is good, is right  
I say  
When you were again  
And you were my friend  
Before the lie  
This one  
Say yes I do  
And with you  
Sometimes  
  
But while I do my best  
With all the rest I leave to you  
Can't wait for the hour  
And when two things become this  
All this trouble from a kiss from you, I'll do it  
And when you come up smiling  
And I'm thrown  
Into I get a little storm with you, I'll do it  
  
Always  
Lover, line up and yeah  
The road to you is long and I've been on it for a while  
And a need a warm embrace  
I'll take a break  
And say I want to leave you awake  
  
Always  
  
I feel tired...

Oh Lyrics  
Dave Matthews  
  
The world is blowing up  
The world is caving in  
The world has lost her way again  
But you are here with me  
But you are here with me  
Makes it ok  
  
I hear you still talk to me  
As if you're sitting in that dusty chair  
Makes the hours easier to bear  
I know despite the years alone  
I'll always listen to you sing your sweet song  
And if it's all the same to you  
  
I love you oh so well  
Like a kid loves candy and fresh snow  
I love you oh so well  
Enough to fill up heaven overflow and fill hell  
Love you oh so well  
  
And it's cold and darkness falls  
It's as if you're in the next room so alive  
I could swear I hear you singing to me  
  
I love you oh so well  
Like a kid loves candy and fresh snow  
I love you oh so well  
Enough to fill up heaven overflow and fill hell  
  
The world is blowing up  
The world is caving in  
The world has lost her way again  
But you are here with me  
But you are here with me  
Makes it ok  
  
Oh girl you're singing to me still  
I love you oh so well  
Like a kid loves candy and fresh snow  
I love you oh so well  
Enough to fill up heaven overflow and fill hell  
Love you oh so well

Bring that beat back to me again  
Take me back, take me back, can't catch me can't catch me  
Bring that beat back to me again  
Take me back, take me back, can't catch me, can't catch me  
  
Ride my bike down that old dirt hill (can't catch me)  
First time without my trainin' wheels  
First time I kissed you I lost my legs (can't catch me)  
Bring that beat back to me again  
  
Screamin', shoutin', louder innocence  
Days when all we did would never end  
  
Bring that beat back to me again  
Take me back, take me back, can't catch me can't catch me  
Bring that beat back to me again  
Take me back, take me back, can't catch me can't catch me  
  
Smokin' on the railroad bridge  
I used to ride my bike down that old dirt hill  
The first time I kissed you I lost my legs  
Bring that beat back to me again  
  
Screamin', shoutin', louder innocence  
Days when all we did would never end  
  
Screamin' down that old dirt hill  
Bring that beat back to me again  
  
Oh when it gets hard  
That's when the days I remember seem so far  
When I was just a kid that's what I miss  
When I was just a kid that's what I miss  
Take me back, Take me back to that beat again  
  
Smokin' on the railroad bridge  
Bring that beat back to me again (again)  
Bring that beat back to me again (can't catch me)  
Bring that beat back to me again  
First time all we were was good friends  
Bring that beat back to me again  
Bring that beat back to me again  
Bring that beat back to me again (can't catch me)  
Bring that beat back to me again  
Bring that beat back to me again  
Bring that beat back to me again

Caught the train from Warrabrook  
All the way into Hornsby.  
But somehow we got stuck  
Next to a fat spastic old lady.  
  
She had a stereo  
And a granny pram.  
A big fat ugly gut  
And a pink bum-bag.  
  
Yeah - Yeah!  
  
All stations to Central.  
She's been herer since New Castle.  
And the Knights are gunna win the comp'  
  
Yeah. Yeah.  
Old Woman on a train.  
  
She had some Choc-Wheaton's  
Some plastic tupperware.  
She hated all Asians  
Cause "they're not from round here"  
  
Yeah - Yeah!  
  
All stations to Central.  
She's been herer since New Castle.  
And the Knights are gunna win the comp'  
  
Yeah. Yeah.  
Old Woman on a train.  
  
All stations to Central.  
She's been herer since New Castle.  
And the Knights are gunna win the comp'  
  
Yeah. Yeah.  
Old Woman on a train.  
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  
Old Woman on a train.  
Yeah. Yeah.  
Old Woman on a train.  
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  
Old Woman on a train.

Hey man I noticed you were  
You were crying  
Ohh shame on you would leave it inside  
Mind open your mind you say "no, well no, will I"  
Hey cause yourself all alone  
You will lie down  
Oh, put yourself away from all your love  
And you will soon lie down  
Said I can leave it way open eyes  
I go to you see me whine  
See me lie here  
Oh, call see me whine call you way down  
The pain has been riddling me oh will I, yeah  
Open, I will  
I will leave it to destiny to choose which way I go to  
I will leave destiny  
To choose which direction it is that I'm gong to  
My face open eye you leave I mean I  
And I will  
And we will leave most men, most men lie  
I fear that we will go away most men, most men  
Leave us crying

Nine planets round the sun  
Only one does the sun embrace  
Upon this watered one  
So much to we take for granted  
  
So let us sleep outside tonight  
Lay down in the mother's arms  
For here we can rest safely  
  
If green should slip to grey  
Would our hearts still bloody beat  
If the mountains crumble away  
And the river dry  
Would it stop the stepping feet  
  
Take all that we can get  
When it's done  
Nobody left to bury  
Nobody left to dig the holes  
And here we will rest safely  
  
One sweet world  
Around this star is spinning  
One sweet world  
In her breath I'm swimming  
And here we will rest in peace.

Out on the window ledge I don't feel safe,  
And I stayed looking down you  
  
It's out of my hands for now  
It's out of my hands for now  
I can't just walk away  
It'd be nice to walk away  
But I don't feel safe  
Get away, all the way up here  
  
It's out of my hands for now  
It's out of my hands for now  
Oh it is down from here  
And down from here  
  
Start to feel insane, betrayed  
Out on my window ledge  
  
And now our finest hour arrives,  
See the pig dressed in his finest fine  
And all the believers stand behind him and smile  
As the day lights up with fire  
Let me in  
Let me in  
I stopped feeling crazy, betrayed  
Out on my window ledge  
  
And now our finest hour arrives,  
See the pig dressed in his finest fine  
And all the believers stand behind him and smile  
Watch the day lights up in fire  
Lookin' down from here  
  
It's out of my hands for now  
Out on my window ledge  
It's out of my hands for now  
So let me in  
Let me in

Work ourselves, fingers to the bone  
Suck the marrow, drain my soul  
Fingers to the bone  
Pay your dues, and your debts  
Pay your respects, everybody tells you  
You pay for what you get  
You pay for what you get  
  
Everybody asks me how she's doin'  
Has she really lost her mind?  
I said, I couldn't tell you  
I've lost mine  
  
Words, words, words, have you heard  
A bird in hand is much better than,  
Any number free to wander  
Fly away...stay  
You pay for what you get  
You pay for what you get  
  
Everybody asks me how she's doing  
Is she really all she says...  
Everybody asks me how she's doing  
Since she went away  
I said I couldn't tell you  
I'm OK I'm OK (I'm OK)  
  
Surprise, surprise  
You pay for what you get  
You pay for what you get  
  
Everybody asks me how she's doing  
Has she really lost her...  
Everybody asks me how she's doing  
Since she went away  
I said I couldn't tell you  
I'm OK I'm OK I'm OK (How are you?)  
  
Pay for what you get  
Pay for what you get...oh...  
Pay for what you get  
Pay for what you get oh...  
Oh...

Seven tumbling oceans surround the ground that I dance upon  
Black and white and the rainbow, five colors in my eyes  
Seven tumbling oceans surround the ground that I dance upon  
Black and white and the rainbow, five colors in my eyes  
  
People, people  
What are we doing here  
Oh, people  
What have we done with things  
People, people  
What are we doing here  
Oh, people  
What have we done with things  
  
When we fight over the oceans?  
When we fight over the skies, and why?  
When we fight over our borders?  
Then we, our brothers and sisters deny  
  
Tell me why is it so cold in here  
  
Seven tumbling oceans surround the ground that I dance upon  
Black and white and the rainbow, five colors in my eyes  
When we stand in the mother's arms, no feeling of emptiness  
When we stand in the mother's hands, we can see that  
When we fight over the oceans  
When we fight over the skies, and why  
When we fight over our borders  
Then we, our brothers and sisters deny  
  
Tell me why do we do it  
Why do we do it? Oh, .. .

Isn't it strange  
How we move our lives for another day  
Like skipping a beat  
What if a great wave should wash us all away  
Just thinking out loud  
Don't mean to dwell on this dying thing  
But looking at blood  
It's alive right now  
Deep and sweet within  
Pouring through our veins  
Intoxicate moving wine to tears  
Drinking it deep  
Then an evening spent dancing  
It's you and me  
This love will open our world  
From the dark side we can see a glow of something bright  
There's much more than we see here  
Don't burn the day away  
Is this not enough  
This blessed sip of life  
Is it not enough  
Staring down at the ground  
Oh then complain and pray more from above  
Greedy little pig  
Stop just watch your world trickle away  
Oh it's your problem now  
It'll all be dead and gone in a few short years  
Just love will open our eyes  
Just love will put the hope in our minds  
Much more than we could ever know  
Don't burn the day away  
Come sister my brother  
Shake up your bones shake up your feet  
I'm saying open up  
And let the rain come pouring in  
Wash out this tired notion  
That the best is yet to come  
But while you're dancing on the ground  
Don't think of when you're gone  
Love love what more is there  
We need the light of love in here  
Don't beat your head  
Dry your eyes  
Let the love in there  
There are bad times  
But that's ok  
Just look for love in it  
Don't burn the day away  
Look  
Here are we  
On this starry night staring into space  
And I must say  
I feel as small as dust  
Lying down here  
What point could there be troubling  
Head down wondering what will become of me  
Why concern we cannot see  
But no reason to abandon it  
Time is short but that's all right  
Maybe I'll go in the middle of the night  
Take your hands from your eyes, my love  
Everything must end some time  
Don't burn the day away  
Come sister my brother  
Shake up your bones shake up your feet  
I'm saying open up  
And let the rain come flooding in  
Wash out this tired notion  
That the best is yet to come  
But while you're dancing on the ground  
Don't think of when you're gone  
Love love what more is there  
We need the light of love in here  
Don't beat your head  
Dry your eyes  
Let the love in there  
There are bad times  
But that's ok  
Just look for love in it

Oh, rain, well, in your dreams, rain, right  
Go up and rain when you're flying  
You don't know what you don't know  
You know what you don't know  
And you know what you know  
Why rain?  
But you're evil  
I have deep confidence in me  
Rain, but sure is rain  
I won't go away from you  
Oh, I am the devil, I am rain  
The devil hides in you, to play again  
Oh yeah God  
Sometimes I'll sleep on it  
This life I would maybe think to hang it up in the cupboard  
And hope for something better  
But alright... Now it fades away into nothing, baby, baby, baby

Open wide Oh so good I'll eat you  
Take me for a ride  
In your sweet delicious  
Perfect little mouth  
Thereupon I linger  
You will have no doubt  
I'll do my best for you, I do  
Love  
Let's stop to get it going  
Lost myself just thinking  
About the two of us  
From each other drinking  
Begin with the lips  
Fingertips and kissing  
Turn me inside out  
I do my best for you  
Up and down we go  
From the top you push me  
This is such a thrill  
Lost in love and dancing  
Shake your tambourine  
You blow my head open  
Of this there's no doubt  
I do my best for you I do  
For you I would crawl  
Through the darkest dungeon  
Climb the castle wall  
If you are my Rapunzel  
You let your hair down  
Right in through your window  
Good they locked the door  
I do my best for you  
I think the world of you  
All of my heart I do  
Blood through my veins for you  
You alone have all of me  
I give my world to you  
To you I will be true  
Too good to be real  
Smell of something cooking  
My soul you're to steal  
Food of love we're filling  
What you've given me  
For it there is no measure  
Of one thing I know  
I'll give my best for you  
I think the world of you  
All of my heart I do  
Blood through my veins for you  
You alone have all of me  
From you my strength is full  
To carry your burdens too  
I give my world to you  
Hip lock up so tight  
You drive me crazy  
Crazy is all right  
With you looking at me  
You make me feel high  
Every single thing you do to me  
Is like I'm drunk  
I do my best for you, I do

Lies and reason you give  
Too much is not enough  
Leave, what you see leave alone  
Someone else to go  
  
Romance holds you to tea, yeah  
Sip it like you're typical  
My love is what you make of it  
Brothers and sisters, it's not enough...  
Not enough  
  
Talk, call, talking of leading the way  
Won't ya give any lie?  
Of all the ways  
Won't ya lie with me?  
  
Man, I've no Raven to see here  
Flies the blackest way  
What you give when you get nothing  
Is everything you give  
  
All been tossed away  
Read, light your morning candles  
Make your way  
All wise men today grieve  
It knows no better thing  
  
All I leave here, a way to send you all down, down, down  
All my worries is where the girl will be found, found, found  
All my worries of all those things that I dreamed and dreamed and dreamed  
All I leave is, I have to say  
It's nothing more than my point of view  
  
It's hard and cold tonight  
You're warming by a fire  
Oh, sweet juice  
Drink tonight  
Take me while I'm out  
  
No, no Raven to see here  
It imitates beauty well  
Black bird from a dark Heaven  
Oh, won't you keep living a lie  
  
All God tossed away  
Read while you know  
You know things fade to grey  
Oh, what came of grace  
Oh, the morning and the rain  
  
All my worries warn enough to roam, roam, roam  
Fade away here, the girl will go round and round and round  
Hey, love...  
What was the greatest thing you  
Moments in the cold rain  
Here to say there's nothing great that you wouldn't do  
  
Fly, Raven...  
Won't you guide me?  
Oh, what's the reason?  
Won't you guide me?  
Wait, now, what is the Raven?  
Won't you come to me?  
What you did with the same grace at all  
Won't you keep living a lie  
  
All been tossed away  
Read all you'll have ever known  
I believe  
All I know today  
Read all to believe

Whatcha got  
Whatcha got in your hand  
The father said his son  
I got the whole world here daddy  
'tween my fingers and my thumb  
Will you take care of it please?  
It's the only one  
It'd take me a lifetime old man  
To undo whatcha done  
To undo whatcha done  
Oh c'mon now  
Boy think what would Jesus do  
He'd shake his head like an angry mother  
Spoke the boy and say 'I did what I could do'  
But you take care of it please?  
It's the only one ya got  
It'll take ten lifetimes boy  
To undo what I've done  
Boy shrugged walked away  
The man stood and watched as he was leaving  
Boy just walked away  
The man stood alone thinking  
One hand is bleeding  
And the other hand holds a gun  
While everything is open  
Everything is shut down, down, down  
Begin to ending is really  
Just a go round, and round, and round  
And while I stand here, the ground beneath is nothing  
More than one point of view  
What you got, what you got in your hand?  
Your secret's safe with me  
Well I found the truth friend  
Let me whisper in your ear  
Take good care of it please  
It's the only one there is  
Can I twist it please, can I give it just a little twist?  
Boy shrugged walked away  
The man stood and watched that boy disappearing  
Boy just walked away  
The man stood there twisting  
One hand is bleeding, Oh as the other hand holds the gun  
Everything is open  
Now everything is shut down, down, down  
No one is hoping, even if you know  
You never know it all  
The ground beneath is  
Nothing more than my point of view  
Boy shrugged walked away  
The man stood and watched, the boy was leaving  
Boy just walked away  
The man stood there twisting  
One hand is open and the other hand holds the gun  
Everything is undone  
Or is everything coming down, down, down  
No one is hoping, even if you know  
You never know it all  
Nothing more than my point of view.  
  
Boy shrugged walked away  
The man stood and watched as he was leaving  
The man just stood there twisting

Recently I've been  
All of content and dreaming I have been  
Cause I've been lately seeing  
Quite a bit of this woman live on my street  
  
People stare and we just ignore everything  
People stare and we just ignore them  
And they go away, go away  
  
She comes to me  
I watch her drink  
I watch her comb her hair  
Both say that we never before have  
Felt as recently  
  
People stare and we just ignore  
What's the use in hiding out  
She says all the time  
Let their eyes do the worrying about  
  
She and me go to place quiet  
Where we are quite alone  
Kiss and we hold together  
We will be until we're done  
  
People stare and we just ignore  
What's the use in hiding out  
She says all the time  
Let their eyes do the worrying about  
  
Walk and talk, we both do quite well  
And kissing all the time, kissing all the time  
And I'm looking forward to much more  
  
Both say that we never before  
Never before have we felt so recently  
People stare and we just ignore everything  
People stare and we just ignore them  
And they go away, go away

Standing on the rooftop  
There's all these people watching  
Hard to find the words  
When you got so far to fall  
Just trying to keep a secret  
And never tell a soul no no  
Take another drink so  
I can loose control  
  
I, I want you to  
Tell me that you want me, just want me too  
I, I want you to  
Tell me that you want me, just want me  
  
If I was a winner  
I'd cut the cards and deal them  
Buy a great big house where  
We could disappear  
But you find yourself a sweet spot  
And people want to get some  
You're just anther dead man  
Trying to fool the world  
  
I, I want you to  
Tell me that you want me, want me too  
I, I want you to  
Tell me that you want me, want me too  
  
I gave you the best of me  
And you said goodbye  
Should have taken the rest of me  
See the morning come up come up  
If you're going out tonight  
Maybe I'll catch you right  
Maybe we'll loose our minds tonight  
And fall until we fly  
  
I, I want you  
Tell me that you want me,want me too  
I, I want you to just  
Tell me that you want me, want me too  
  
I, I want you  
Tell me that you want me,want me too  
I, I want you to just  
Tell me that you want me, want me

She walks through my head [?]  
Oh mountains change my way  
Walking would have been faster  
But mountains got in the way  
Lotta snow today  
Lotta snow today  
And we go here [?]  
Got me tired again  
  
Hey  
Drive two miles an hour down a mountain trail  
Don't go any faster, gonna lose my way  
Can't go any faster, gonna lose my way  
Right on the mountain, snow today

Gonna be late if we don't find our way  
Hurry, yeah

Driving through the desert I met a man  
Who told me of his crazy plan  
He'd been walking there for 20 days  
He was gonna walk on for 20 more  
I said, "How 'bout a drink or a bite to eat"  
He said, "No, my faith is all I need"  
So then, save me, save me  
Mister walking man, if you can  
  
You don't need to prove a thing to me  
Just give me faith make me believe  
C'mon save me, save me  
Mister walking man, if you can  
C'mon save me, save me  
I said, "Stranger if you please"  
Save me, save me  
Stranger if you please  
Or am I too far gone?  
I said, "to get back home"  
  
How 'bout you take a ride with me  
We could kill some time, shoot the breeze  
He said, "every whispering wind and second counts"  
Oh, maybe if you walk but you should drive around  
  
Save me, save me  
Mister walking man, if you can  
C'mon save me, save me  
I said, "stranger, if you please"  
Save me, save me  
Stranger, if you please  
Or am I too far gone?  
To get back home  
  
I don't need you to stop the sunshine, no  
I don't need you to turn water into wine, no  
I don't need you to, to fly  
I'm just asking you to save me  
  
(You might try savin' yourself)

Pass the time with you in mind  
It's a rather quiet night  
Feel the ground against my back  
Counting stars against the black  
Thinking bout another day  
Wishing I was far away  
Whether they were dreams or worries  
You were there with me  
  
Sister, I hear you laugh  
My heart fills full up  
Keep me please  
Sister, when you cry  
I feel your tears running down my face  
Sister, Sister keep me  
  
I hope you always know it's true  
I would never make it through  
We could make the sun go down  
Just by walking away  
Playing like we used to play  
Our kingdom will never go away  
Feel you beating in my chest  
I'll be dead without  
  
Sister, I hear you laugh  
My heart fills full up  
Keep me please  
Sister, when you cry  
I feel your tears running down my face  
Sister, Sister will you keep me?  
  
I would never make it through  
Hope you always know it's true  
You could make the heaven's fall  
Just by walking away  
  
Sister, I hear you laugh  
My heart fills full up  
Keep me please  
Sister, when you cry  
I feel your tears running down my face  
Sister, Sister keep me

Last night no way  
I was gonna be left hungry  
Then your daddy caught me sneaking out your bed  
It's just a game I play  
Its just a roll that way  
These things sweet baby,  
Are messing with your head  
  
I'm a smooth rider baby  
You know I just keep moving on  
Don't know why I like to carry on  
The way i do  
It's just that I'm in love with you  
  
If you see me out there runnin'  
And you hear the sheriffs comin'  
Your daddy's crazy with that gun in his hand  
If you know they're comin' for me  
And you know they're runnin' for me  
You my love won't let them keep me away  
  
I'm a smooth rider baby  
You know I just keep movin' on  
Don't know why I like to carry on  
The way I do

If you see me out there runnin'  
And you hear the sheriffs comin'  
Your daddy's crazy with that gun in his hand  
If you know they're comin' for me  
And you know they're runnin' for me  
You my love won't let them keep me away  
  
I'm a smooth rider baby

You are like a secret garden  
As I shuffle through this broken town  
Think of you and you are all around me  
Like the sky when the sun's going down  
I want to tell the whole wide world  
And see how love can light your soul  
But you are like my secret garden  
And I want to be with you alone  
  
Oh, Hold tight  
'Cause the road can be a crazy ride  
And I know we're going to be alright  
'Cause you are here with me  
Oh, woman is so right  
And even if the oceans divide us  
I will be here right by your side  
For the rest of our days  
Here for the rest of our days  
  
If you are tired I'll bear your burden  
If you are dreaming I will not disturb you  
Whatever your heart desires love love  
I'll clear the way for you  
Come winter I will build you a fire  
From the bones of who I used to be  
Before you came and washed the weary away  
Before you came here for me  
So right every day and every night  
By the fire with the snow outside  
And the two of us  
Oh child hold tight  
If it gets to be a crazy ride  
I'll be here right by your side  
For the rest of our days  
Oh, for the rest of our days  
  
So right  
Holding on to this crazy ride  
Hold on we'll be alright  
Me and you and you and me  
Here you come you bring me real love  
From the ground beneath to the stars above  
I was growing down now I'm growing up  
With you in my blood  
Yeah this is real love  
Shining down like the stars above  
Arms out and I am growing up  
With you in my blood  
Oh you know that its alright  
Feels bigger than the whole world wide  
You know come the morning light  
Oh I know that I am yours  
That I am yours  
That I am yours

Everything's different  
My head in the clouds  
  
I hit this corner  
With my foot on the gas  
I started sliding, I lose it  
Everything's different just like that  
  
Oh my God, wait and see  
What will soon become of me?  
Frozen heart  
Screaming wheels  
Does that screaming come from me?  
So damn lucky, when you went on ahead  
You say, you say  
I see you later  
I heard what you said a few minutes later  
I'm sliding  
Everything's different, again  
  
Oh my God, wait and see  
What will soon become of me?  
This frozen heart  
Screaming wheels  
But does that screaming come from me?  
I'm dizzy from all this spinning  
Now I'm thinking that you did all you could  
  
When you said my love  
Take it slowly  
Ok, is what I said  
Oh my God, wait and see  
What will soon become of me?  
Frozen heart  
Screaming wheels  
  
But does that screaming come from me?  
Take me back, just before I was spinning  
Take me back, just before I got dizzy  
Take me back, amazing what a minute can do  
Just like you  
  
So, so, so, so, up, around, around, around  
Amazing what a minute can do  
Around, around, around  
Ok

Say my hell is the closet  
I'm stuck inside  
Can't see the light  
And my heaven is a nice house in the sky  
Got central heating  
And I'm alright  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Can't see the light  
Keep it locked up inside  
Don't talk about it  
Talk about the weather  
Can't see the light  
Open up my head and let me out, little baby  
Here we have been standing for a long, long time  
Treading trodden trails for a long, long time  
  
I say my hell is the closet I'm stuck inside  
Can't see the light  
And my heaven is a nice house in the sky  
Got central heating and I'm alright  
Here we have been standing for a long, long time  
Treading trodden trails for a long, long time  
I find sometimes it's easy to be myself  
Sometimes I find it's better to be somebody else  
  
I see you young and soft oh little baby  
Little feet, little hands, little baby  
One year of cryin' and the words creep up inside  
Creep into your mind  
So much to say  
Here we have been standing for a long, long time  
Treading trodden trails for a long, long time  
I find sometimes it's easy  
To be myself  
Sometimes I find it's better  
To be somebody else  
  
So much to say  
Open up my head and let me out  
Little baby

Roll out down to midnight  
Then roll on downtown 'til it's light  
Because tomorrow we may die  
Oh, but tonight we're dancing in the faint light  
Don't you rob yourself of what you're feeling  
Don't rob yourself of all that you could be  
Roll hard 'til midnight  
Roll 'til it's light  
  
Come on now  
Stay up and make some memories

And it's all 'cause of you (it's all 'cause of you)  
I'm going under, over you, over you...  
  
This time is so alive  
Everybody's tranced, dancing tonight  
Oh so beautiful, and so strange  
Oh, it was empty until you came...  
  
Our love is so right  
Forget the clouds that rain on your light  
Our love is so right  
I'll not forget how you look right now  
  
Our love is so right  
Remember let's just move together  
Our love is so right

Your probably gonna move, But I caught you now  
Now Ill just have to bow down now  
Cause I love the way you move me  
I love the way you move me

Don't always like the skin I'm in  
Where were gonna go, I want to start again  
But I love the way you move me  
I love the way you move me  
  
Oh ah, ah ah Yeah  
All the freaks are on parade  
I wanna fill my belly, so I gotta get paid  
Doesn't everyone deserve to have the good life  
Don't always work out  
Cry cry baby, if you must  
Just remember  
  
Just remember, I love the way you love me  
I love the way you move me  
  
I'm not all there, I'm a faithful sinner  
I might get lost, but Ill be home for dinner  
If God don't like me, he can hand me to hell  
But I love the way you love me girl  
I love the way you move me  
  
I pray to heaven to keep my place  
Till I look to the mirror and saw the Devils face  
And Id be a dog, for a tail to chase  
But I love the way you kiss me baby  
I love the way you talk to me  
I love the way you talk to me  
  
Oh ah, ah ah Yeah  
All the freaks are on parade  
I wanna fill my belly, so I gotta get paid  
Doesn't everyone deserve to have the good life  
Don't always work out  
Cry cry baby, if you must  
Just remember  
  
The way you move me  
  
(Jam)  
  
Not coming home till the good days gone  
Working as hard, as the day is long  
Working men watch me, when I get home  
Cause I love the way you talk baby  
I love the way you move  
  
Oh ah, ah ah Yeah  
All the freaks are on parade  
I wanna fill my belly, so I gotta get paid  
Doesn't everyone deserve to have the good life  
Don't always work out  
Cry cry baby, if you must  
Just remember  
  
Well remember  
All the freaks are on parade  
I wanna fill my belly, so I gotta get paid  
Doesn't everyone deserve to have the good life  
Don't always work out  
Cry cry baby, if you must  
Just remember  
  
I love the way you love me girl.  
I love the way you move.

Spoon in spoon  
Stirring my coffee  
I thought of you  
And turned to the gate  
On my way came up with the answers  
I scratched my head  
And the answers were gone  
From hand to hand  
Wrist to the elbow  
Red blood sand  
Could Dad be God  
Crosses cross hung out like a wet rag  
Forgive you? Why?  
You hung me out to dry  
Maybe I'm crazy  
But laughing out loud  
Makes the pain pass by  
And maybe you're a little crazy  
But laughing out loud makes  
It all subside  
Holding, I'm holding  
I'm still falling  
Spoon in spoon  
Stirring my coffee  
I thought of this  
And turned to the gate  
But on my way  
Crack  
Lightning and thunder  
I hid my head  
And the storm slipped away  
Well maybe I'm crazy  
And laughing out loud  
Makes it all pass by  
And maybe you're a little crazy  
And laughing out loud  
Makes it all alright  
Laughing out loud  
From time to time  
Minutes and hours  
Some move ahead while  
Some lag behind  
It's like the balloon that  
Rise and then vanish  
This drop of hope  
That falls from his eyes  
Spoon in spoon  
Stirring my coffee  
I think of this  
And turn to go away  
But as I walk  
There are voices behind me saying  
Sinners sin  
Come now and play

(Alien jargon)  
  
Get up y'all, yeah.  
  
Stand Up (5x)  
  
I woke up to the angels,  
They singing in my head.  
You look so good naked next to me,  
The angel in my bed.  
  
Stand Up (4x)  
  
Oh you feel like a drug,  
That's cooking in my veins.  
Till I'm so out of my mind,  
And shoots you up again.  
  
Stand Up (4x)  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
Save my soul... Stand Up  
  
Smell like smoky fire  
Is burning in us all.  
You drop me in the water  
Lift me up, save my soul.  
  
Stand Up (8x)  
  
(Sax Solo)  
  
Save my soul... Stand Up  
  
Stand Up (12x) (fade out)

We were walking  
Just the other day  
It was so hot outside  
You could fry an egg  
Remember you were talking  
I watched as sweat ran down your face  
Reached up and caught it at your chin  
Licked my fingertip  
Wasting time  
Let the hours roll by  
Doing nothing for the fun  
Little taste of the good life  
Whether right or wrong  
Makes us want to stay, stay, stay  
For awhile  
Later on the sun began to fade  
Then the clouds rolled over our heads  
And it began to rain  
Oh we were dancing mouths open  
Splashing tongue taste  
For a moment this good time would never end  
You and me  
You and me  
Just wasting time  
I was kissing you  
You were kissing me love  
From good day into a moonlight  
Now a night so fine  
Makes us wanna stay, stay, stay, stay for awhile  
Wasting time  
I shall miss these things  
When it all rolls by  
What a day  
Wanna stay, stay, stay, stay for awhile  
Hey love  
Oh just groping you  
Rolling in the mud  
Stay a while  
Come on love  
Wanna stay, stay, stay, stay for awhile

Maybe different but remember  
Winters warm where you and I  
Kissing whiskey by the fire  
With the snow outside  
And when the summer comes  
In the river  
Swims at midnight  
Shiver cold  
Touch the bottom  
Starry night  
With muddy toes  
  
Stay or leave  
I want you not to go  
But you should  
It was good as good goes  
Stay or leave  
I want you not to go  
But you did  
  
Wake up naked drinking coffee  
Making plans to change the world  
While the world is changing us  
It was good good love  
You used to laugh under the covers  
Maybe not so often now  
But the way I used to laugh with you  
Was loud and hard  
  
Stay or leave  
I want you not to go  
But you should  
It was good as good goes  
Stay or leave  
I want you not to go  
But you did  
  
So what to do  
With the rest of the day's afternoon hey  
Isn't it strange how we change  
Everything we did  
Did I do all that I should  
  
That I coulda done  
Remember we used to dance  
And everyone wanted to be  
You and me  
I want to be too  
What day is this  
Besides the day you left me  
What day is this  
Besides the day you went  
  
So what to do  
With the rest of the day's afternoon hey  
Well isn't it strange how we change  
Everything we did  
Did I do all that I could  
  
Remember we used to dance  
And everyone wanted to be you and me  
I want to be too  
What day is this  
Besides the day you went babe  
What day is this

I'll walk halfway around the world  
Just to sit down by your side  
And I would do most anything, girl  
To be the apple of your eye  
Well troubles, they may come and go  
But good times, they're the gold  
And if the road gets rocky, girl  
Just steady as we go  
  
Any place you wanna go  
Know I'll be next to you  
If it's treasure, baby, you're looking for  
I'll search the whole world through  
I know troubles, they may come and go  
But good times, they're the gold  
So if the road gets rocky, girl  
Just steady as we go  
  
When the storm comes down you shelter me  
When I don't say a word and you know exactly what I mean  
In the darkest times, oh, you shine on me  
You set me free and keep me steady as we go  
  
So if your heart wrings dry, my love  
I will fill your cup  
And if your load gets heavy, girl  
I will lift you up  
Well troubles, they may come and go  
But good times be the gold  
So if the road gets rocky, girl  
Just steady as we go  
  
Shine, shine, shine  
Shine on me

Hello again  
Seems like forever between now and then  
You look the same  
I mean you look different but you haven't changed  
Funny to think how the time gets away  
Funny how you take me right back again  
  
Stole me away  
First time I saw you you did me that way  
What should I say  
I saw you laughing and I was afraid  
I might get in the way  
  
I did not think I would see you again  
So how have you been  
Do you remember...  
And  
How's everything  
Funny I think how time gets away  
Funny how you take me right back again  
  
Stole me away  
First time I saw you you did me that way  
What should I say  
Saw you there dancing but I was afraid  
I might get in the way  
  
I did not think I would see you again  
Funny to think how the time gets away  
Funny how you take me right back again  
Funny the feeling when forever ends  
You stole me away  
First time I saw you you did me that way  
What should I say  
Saw you there dancing but I was afraid  
I might get in the way  
  
Never thought I would see you again  
So how have you been  
Watching the years as they trickle away  
It's everything  
How the time gets away  
Funny how you take me right back again  
  
Steal me away  
  
It's like the first time I saw you you do me that way  
What should I say  
I see you here standing and I am afraid  
I might get in your away  
  
I never thought I would see again  
How have you been  
Do you remember I mean everything  
You steal me away  
Like the first time I saw you  
You do me that way  
What can I say  
I see you standing here and I am afraid  
I might get in your away

The ingots are burning red  
I'm working time and a half  
Tomorrow I'll stay in bed  
What a life I lead what a life  
Laugh in my face why don't you  
Laugh with the rest I know it well  
I tripped and then I fell for  
The beauty of Wynona  
At night I toss and I turn  
And I try and dial your number  
It's changed and God only knows  
Where you been since last December  
Where you been with that twisted smile  
Laying another on the pile  
It ain't easy when we go down for  
The beauty of Wynona  
Girls they skip double dutch  
I saw you there prayed my God  
But my prayers don't mean nothin much  
With a heart that cannot be won  
Rain in that wishing well  
Right here in my own bed  
It ain't easy when we go down for  
The beauty of wynona

Hey, my friend  
It seems your eyes are troubled  
Care to share your time with me  
Would you say you're feeling low and so  
A good idea would be to get it off of your mind  
  
See, you and me  
Have a better time than most can dream  
Have it better than the best  
And so can pull on through  
Whatever tears at us  
Whatever holds us down  
And if nothing can be done  
We'll make the best of what's around  
  
Turns out not where but who you're with  
That really matters  
That really matters  
And hurts not much when you're around  
When you're around  
  
And if you hold on tight  
To what you think is your thing  
You may find you're missing all the rest  
She ran up into the light surprised  
Her arms are open  
Her mind's eye is...  
  
Seeing things from a  
Better side than most can dream  
On a better road I feel  
So you could say she's safe  
Whatever tears at her  
Whatever holds her down  
And if nothing can be done  
She'll make the best of what's around  
  
Turns out not where but what you think  
That really matters  
That really matters  
That really matters  
And hurts not much when you're around

Standing here  
The old man said to me  
Long before these crowded streets  
Here stood my dreaming tree  
Below it he would sit  
For hours at a time  
Now progress takes away  
What forever took to find  
And now he's falling hard  
He feels the falling dark  
How he longs to be  
Beneath his dreaming tree  
Conquered fear to climb  
A moment froze in time  
When the girl who first he kissed  
Promised him she'd be his  
Remembered mother's words  
There beneath the tree  
No matter what the world  
You'll always be my baby  
Mommy come quick  
The dreaming tree has died  
The air is growing thick  
A fear he cannot hide  
The dreaming tree has died  
  
Oh  
Have you no pity  
This thing I do  
I do not deny it  
All through this smile  
As crooked as danger  
I do not deny  
I know in my mind  
I would leave you now  
If I had the strength to  
I would leave you up  
To your own devices  
Will you not talk  
Can you take pity  
I don't ask much  
But won't you speak  
Please  
  
From the start  
She knew she had it made  
Easy up 'til then  
For sure she'd make the grade  
Adorers came in hordes  
To lay down in her wake  
She gave it all she had  
But treasures slowly fade  
Now she's falling hard  
She feels the fall of dark  
How did this fall apart  
She drinks to fill it up  
A smile of sweetest flowers  
Wilted so and soured  
Black tears stain the cheeks  
That once were so admired  
She thinks when she was small  
There on her father's knee  
How he had promised her  
You'll always be my baby  
Daddy come quick  
The dreaming tree has died  
I can't find my way home  
There is no place to hide  
The dreaming tree has died  
  
Oh  
If I had the strength to  
I would leave you up  
To your own devices  
Will you not talk  
Can you take pity  
I don't ask much  
But won't you speak  
Please  
  
Take me back  
Take me back  
Take me back  
Take me back  
Take me back  
Take me back  
Take me back  
Save me please

Hoping for a new beginning  
To take me away from my surroundings  
So I can finally say goodbye  
Wondering what'll become of us  
When we are all old and gray  
And this time that we've spent together  
Was well worth our wait  
Think of the fun that we had  
Not caring until the next morning  
It feels so good to go through life  
With your eyes half open  
  
We are all one and the same  
We are lovers, and brothers, and sisters  
And most of all friends  
  
These years have passed us by so fast  
It seems like we never got the chance  
To realize how good life really was  
And let the moment last  
And it feels like it was only yesterday  
When we walked into this place  
And said I can't wait till I get out of here  
And now as we walk down this aisle  
With four years all rolled up in a scroll, you can't help but think  
Hey, Where did the time go  
  
We are all one and the same  
We are lovers, and brothers, and sisters  
And most of all friends  
Hold on to your memories  
Hold on to those little things  
And I hope you receive as much as you get  
Cause when you die they're the only things  
That you can take to your grave  
  
These are the days of your life  
And don't let them pass you by  
Cause you never know when you might take your last breath  
And so take a deep one tonight  
  
Good friends we had along the way  
And good friends that didn't make it to where we stand today  
But we all know that they're looking down on us  
And even though their lives were cut short  
We still remember the little thing that made us laugh about them  
And do you remember when and where did you meet them?  
  
We are all one and the same  
We are lovers, and brothers, and sisters  
And most of all friends  
Hold on to your memories  
Hold on to those little things  
And I hope you receive as much as you get  
Cause when you die they're the only things  
That you can take to your grave  
  
And as we approach this final day  
Where we all will go our separate ways  
So go hug and kiss your friends  
And say goodbye to them

Fire the sun is well asleep  
Moon is high above  
Fire grows from the east  
How is this  
Hate so deep  
Lead us all so blindly killing killing  
Fools we are  
If hate's the gate to peace  
This is the last stop  
For raining tears  
War  
The only way to peace  
I don't fall for that  
Raining tears  
You're righteous, so righteous  
You're always so right  
Go ahead and dream  
Go ahead believe that you are the chosen one  
Raining tears  
Oh no  
Gracious even God  
Bloodied the cross  
Your sins are washed enough  
Mother's cry  
"Is hate so deep  
Must a baby's bones  
This hungry fire feed?"  
As smoke clouds roll in  
The symphony of death  
This is the last stop  
Scream  
Right is wrong now  
Shut up you big lie  
This black and white lie  
You comb your hair to hide  
Your lying eyes  
You're righteous, so righteous  
You're always so right  
But why your lie  
Go ahead and dream  
Go ahead believe that you are the chosen one  
This is the last stop  
Here there's more than is showing up  
Hope that we can break it down  
It's not so black and white  
You're righteous  
You're righteous  
You're righteous  
You're always so right  
There you are nailing a good tree  
Then say forgive me, forgive me  
Why  
Raining tears  
This is the last stop  
Here there is more than is showing up  
Hope that we can break it down  
It's not so black and white

Oh, oh deep water, black and cold like the night  
I stand with arms wide open  
I've run a twisted line  
I'm a stranger in the eyes of the Maker  
I could not see for the fog in my eyes  
I could not feel for the fear in my life  
  
From across the great divide, In the distance I saw a light  
Of John Baptist walking to me with the Maker  
My body my body is bent and broken by long and dangerous sleep  
I can't work the fields of Abraham and turn my head away  
I'm not a stranger in the hands of the Maker  
  
Brother John, have you seen the homeless daughters  
Standing here with broken wings  
I have seen the flaming swords  
There over east of Eden  
Burning in the eyes of the Maker  
Burning in the eyes of the Maker  
Burning in the eyes of the Maker  
  
Oh, river rise from your sleep  
Oh, river rise from your sleep  
Oh, river rise from your sleep

Funny how time slips away  
Looking at the cracks creeping across my face  
I remember the little kid living in here  
He'll be living here probably until I'm dead.  
  
Please don't leave me, baby  
Please don't leave me yet.  
  
Sitting in a box away from the world out there  
A world piled high with boxes just like this  
But please don't ever leave me alone in here  
Take me out, shake off the dust, shake off the fear.  
  
Please don't leave me, baby  
Please don't leave me yet.  
  
If you stay with me  
That don't mean we gotta stay the same  
If you stay with me  
Well baby, you and me we'll change the game  
  
Well I don't know the man that's livin' in my head  
'til you reach down and bring the light back in  
No, I don't know the man that's living in my head  
If I don't know the woman sleeping in my bed.  
  
Remember how we used to kiss, baby  
Kiss like it was everything?  
Remember how we used to love, baby  
Love like it was everything?  
  
You stay with me  
That don't mean we have to stay the same  
If you stay with me  
Well baby, you and me we'll change the game  
You stay with me  
I'll follow you and we can start again, baby  
  
I only got a minute or two to spare  
And I gotta whole damn life to fit in there  
So why waste time staring at the T.V. set?  
Like I got dreams to kill and people to forget  
  
Remember how we used to dance, baby  
Just like it was everything?  
  
You stay with me  
And that don't mean we have to stay the same  
You stay with me  
Baby, you and me can make the change  
You stay with me  
But that don't mean I wanna stay the same  
  
You stay with me  
Well baby, you and me we'll change the game

And in plays to write the wire in  
I'll come back again  
Torching time talking rhymes in  
I'll come back again  
  
Would you like to play  
With the thought of a friend  
In a distant passing stage  
While you lie around  
With your hands up and out  
So resigned you will fall down  
  
While you around here play  
Wild on the warm and far away  
While you around here play  
The days keep scribbling themselves in tidy lines  
  
Would you like to play  
With a fool holding hands  
With a one-eyed jack of spades  
While on the deck they sing  
All of the captain's cards are kings  
Still he and the queen are lost at sea  
I hope it isn't you or me  
  
And I'll be back 'round again  
Yes I'll walk in time with you old friend  
And we'll find that place  
That we had danced in so long ago  
And in plays to write the wire in  
I'll come back again  
Torching time talking rhymes in  
I'll come back again  
With this resigned the letter I sign

You cannot quit me so quickly  
Is no hope in you for me?  
No corner you could squeeze me  
But I've got all the time for you love  
  
The space between  
The tears we cry is the laughter keeps us coming back for more  
The space between  
The wicked lies we tell to keep us safe from the pain  
Will I hold you again?  
  
These fickle fuddled words confuse me  
Like will it rain today  
We waste the hours with talking talking  
These twisted games we're playing  
We're strange allies  
With warring hearts  
What a wild-eyed beast you be  
The space between  
  
The wicked lies we tell that hope to keep us safe from the pain  
Look at us spinning out in the madness of a roller coaster  
You know you went off like the devil in the church  
In the middle of a crowded room  
All we can do my love  
  
Is hope we don't take this ship down  
The space between  
Where you smile and hide  
Is where you'll find me if I get to go  
The space between  
The bullets in our firefight  
Is where I'll be hiding waiting for you  
  
The rain that falls  
Splashed in your heart  
Ran like sadness down the window into your room  
The space between  
Our wicked lies is  
The hope to keep us safe from pain  
  
Take my hand  
'cause we're walking out of here  
Right out of here  
Is all we need dear  
The space between  
What's wrong and right  
  
Is where you'll find me hiding waiting for you  
The space between your heart and mind  
Is the space we'll fill with time  
The space between  
The tears we cry is the laughter keeps us coming back for more  
  
The space between our wicked lies  
Where we hope to keep safe from pain  
The space between  
The space between

I've this creeping suspicion  
That things here are not as they seem  
Reassure me  
Of why do I feel as if I'm in too deep  
Now I've been praying  
For some way to show them I'm not what they see  
Yes I have done wrong  
But what I did I thought needed be done  
I swear  
  
[Chorus:]  
Oh unholy day  
If I leave now I might get away  
Oh bu this weighs on me  
As heavy as stone an as blue as I go  
  
I was just wondering if you'd come along  
Hold up my head when my head won't hold on  
I'll do the same if the same's what you want  
If not I'll go  
I will go a...  
  
...long way  
From that fool's mistake  
and now forever pain  
Go run, I will run and I'll be ok  
  
[Chorus]  
  
...long way  
To bury the past for I don't want to pay  
Oh how I wish this  
To turn back the clock and do over again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I need do  
To stay in your arms see you smile hold you close  
And now it weighs on me  
As heavy as stone and a bone-chilling cold  
  
I was just wondering if you'd come along  
Tell me you will

I'm a ticking time bomb  
Waiting to blow my top  
No one would ever know  
Not til I grew up  
  
No one would believe it  
He was such a normal guy  
Shake their heads and wonder why  
  
Martians fell from the sky  
What would that do to god?  
Would we put the weapons down  
Or aim it up at the sky  
  
No one would believe it  
Except the fucking nut jobs  
They laugh and cry we told you so  
  
Baby when I get home  
I want to believe in Jesus  
Hammer in the final nail  
Help me pick up the pieces  
  
When everything starts to fall  
So fast that it terrifies you  
When will you hit the wall?  
Are you gonna learn to fly?  
  
No one would believe it  
Except for all the people  
Watching as you fly away  
  
Baby when I get home  
I want to pick up the pieces  
Hammer in the final nail  
And lean me up against Jesus  
  
Baby when I get home  
I want to pick up the pieces  
Hammer in the final nail  
I want to believe in Jesus

Hey, your bones are brittle  
Inside you  
Wrapped so soft your blood is running  
I'll be there  
If you're moving slowly  
Will you still get there  
I'll be there  
Such a strong desire  
Like a hunger  
  
All you need  
To hope you keep your head yeah  
As the slow hand quickens  
  
What you've done with  
All those around you  
Hope for always that someone  
Will come and save you  
Well I'll be there  
To watch you sultry turning  
Seething, I'll be there  
Minutes hold on to hours  
Gets you twisting  
  
All you need  
To hope you keep your head yeah oh  
The slow hand quickens  
  
How'd you leave it  
With the love you lost  
You made them crawl to be without you  
The slow hand quickens  
  
Yes sand is empty  
In the hourglass  
I'll be there  
To turn it over and over  
In your head  
  
So you keep the hope  
You get your day yeah oh  
As the slow hand quickens  
  
Oh you see  
Too hard to break  
Too cold to burn  
Afraid your chance is gone  
The wires are crossed  
Your mouth is lost  
You fear you've left it far too long  
The minutes pass  
The hours are gone  
So hard to find your way alone  
As the slow hands quicken  
The slow hands quicken  
  
These slow hands quicken

Straight in, suck up and go,  
Cool it swallow, swallow  
Oo Breathe deep, take it all it comes cheap  
Push it through the doors  
'Cause in between the lines  
I'm gonna pack more lines  
So I can get down in  
  
Ooh traffic jam got more cars  
Than a beach got sand  
Suck it up, suck it up,  
Zip suck it up,  
Fill it up 'til no more  
I'm no crazy creep, I've got it coming  
To me 'cause I'm not satisfied  
The hunger keeps on growing  
I eat too much  
I drink too much  
I want too much  
Too much  
  
I've got to get it somewhere  
I mean, you never know, maybe  
You're dreaming  
Who do you think you're watching  
Who do you think you need  
Play for me, play more,  
Ten times in the same day  
I need more, I'm going  
Over my borders  
I'm going to take more, more  
From you, letter by letter  
  
I eat too much  
I drink too much  
I want too much  
Too much  
  
I told, god, I'm coming  
To your country  
I'm going to eat up your cities,  
Your homes, you know  
I've got a stomach full it's not  
A chip on my shoulder  
I've got this growl in my tummy  
And I'm gonna stop it today  
  
I eat too much  
I drink too much  
I want too much  
Too much  
  
Suck it up...

Hey grace, oh, night is you know a couple of hours a day for nothing  
If you can hope you can hold on to your heaven  
Remember it when you said once you tell  
'cause what you don't know, you don't know, it gets you in trouble  
Sometimes you know you don't know - find your way  
But now watching over you now, I'll get you over  
If you don't pretend you know what you don't know, you don't know again  
I'm gonna walk back in your arms  
If I'm only invited back again

We were above  
You standing underneath us  
We were not yet lovers  
Dragons were smoked  
Bumblebees were stinging us  
I was soon to be crazy  
Eat, drink and be merry  
For tomorrow we die  
'Cause we're tripping billies  
  
We're wearing nothing  
Nothing but out shadows  
Shadows falling down on the beach sand  
Remembering once,  
Out on the beaches we wore  
Pineapple grass bracelets  
  
So why would you care  
To get out of this place  
You and me and all our friends  
Such a happy human race  
'Cause we're tripping billies  
  
We are all sitting  
Legs crossed round a fire  
My yellow flame she dances  
Tequila drinking oh our  
Minds will wonder  
To wonderous places  
  
So why would you care  
To get out of this place  
You and me and all our friends  
Such a happy human race  
  
Eat, drink and be merry  
For tomorrow we die

Trouble  
Don't you see  
That in your bed  
I find no sleep  
I confess you came because of me  
Trouble get behind me now  
Trouble let me be  
  
Cold wet stone  
Deep river bed  
Once so clean and clear now runs red  
You know too well  
Was me that called you here  
Trouble get behind me now  
Trouble let me be  
  
Oh sweet day  
Leave me behind  
I will never call on you  
Until the day I die  
Pray your mercy shine on me  
Pray your mercy shine  
  
Here I stand  
Head bowed for thee  
My empty heart begs you  
Leave me be  
But I confess  
You know too well  
That I have fallen  
Pray your mercy give to me  
Pray your mercy shine  
Trouble thou  
And trouble thee  
Let your mercy shine  
  
Cold wet stone  
River deep and red  
Your cold heart beats inside my head  
You know too well  
It was me that brought you here  
Ohhh trouble get behind me now  
Trouble let me be  
I pray your mercy shine on me  
Trouble let me be

The brightest star on a cloudless night  
Some kind of miracle, almost empty sky  
Infact as sure as God is a monkey's dream  
And ate that mushroom and believe what he sees  
  
Trouble with you is you always wanna find the fire  
Sittin' warmin' your hands by the fireside  
Trouble with you is you're always lookin way outside (way outside)  
Oh why not enjoy yourself by the fireside?  
  
Just as the bite of the blade wakes the absent mind  
There's time to dream and there's time to open your eyes  
She said, just as the warmth of a kiss brings the love alive  
It's right here by the fire where the answers lie  
  
Trouble with you is you always wanna find the fire  
Oh when you're warmin' your hands by the fireside  
Trouble with you is you're always lookin' far and wide (way outside)  
Oh why not enjoy yourself by the fireside  
  
She said why you always lookin', always lookin'?  
She said why you always lookin' outside?  
She said  
  
The trouble with you is you're always lookin' for the fire  
When you're warmin' your hands by the fireside  
The trouble with you is you're always lookin' far and wide (way outside)  
Oh why not enjoy yourself by the fireside? (way outside)  
  
The trouble with you is you're always lookin' somewhere else (way outside)  
Oh then what you see there beside yourself  
The trouble with you is you're always lookin' for the fire (way outside)  
Oh why not enjoy yourself by the fireside?  
Oh why not enjoy yourself by the fireside?  
She said, oh why not enjoy yourself sittin' by the fire?  
She said  
The trouble with you  
The trouble with you

Say, my love, I came to you with best intentions  
You laid down and gave to me just what I'm seeking  
Love, you drive me to distraction  
  
Hey my love do you believe that we might last a thousand years  
Or more if not for this,  
Our flesh and blood  
It ties you and me right up  
Tie me down  
  
Celebrate we will  
Because life is short but sweet for certain  
We're climbing two by two  
To be sure these days continue  
These things we cannot change  
  
Hey, my love, you came to me like wine comes to this mouth  
Grown tired of water all the time  
You quench my heart and you quench my mind  
  
Celebrate we will  
Because life is short but  
Sweet for certain  
We're climbing two by two  
To be sure these days continue  
The things we cannot  
Celebrate, you and me, climbing two by two, to be sure  
These days continue, things we cannot change  
  
Oh, my love I came to you  
With best intentions  
You laid down and gave to me  
Just what I'm seeking  
  
Celebrate we will  
Because life is short  
But sweet for certain  
We're climbing two by two  
To be sure these days continue  
Things we cannot change...  
Things we cannot change

Everyday, everyday with you  
Every little thing you do the way you do  
Little darlin' in your eyes  
Got me all up and away  
You get me high  
  
I saw you there, since then everyday  
It's like I'm lost and thinking of you in every way  
Since I fell into your eyes  
All I know is that you get me high  
You get me high  
  
Like I'm gone, ooo  
Oh, up and away  
You take me baby  
Oh, you take me baby  
  
And then you walk the way you walk  
You blow my mind to know the way you walk in my way  
Then I fall into your eyes  
Up, up and away the way you rise  
Oh, baby  
The way you make me high  
  
Before you came you know I never cared  
It's just the game I play  
All up and away  
Oh, all up and away  
You take me baby  
  
Up for you, I'd give it all  
Cause when I'm thinking of you  
When I'm flying above the world  
How I wish I was drowning in you  
I must admit that I'm oh so in love you know  
Please don't ever let me go  
You've done nothing to me but up, up and away you go  
All up and away  
Oh, you take me baby  
Yeah  
Mmmmm baby  
Awwww baby

So I'm leaving...  
This warehouse frightens me.  
Has me tied up in knots,  
Can't rest for a moment.  
  
Soon I'm going...  
I'm slipping slow away  
Hoping to find something better than  
I've got inside here  
And the warehouse slips away...  
  
Hey reckless mind  
Don't throw away your playful beginning  
You and I will fumble around in the touches  
And be sure to...  
  
Leave all the lights on  
So we can see the black cat changing colors  
And we can walk under ladders  
And swim as the tide turns you around and around  
  
Hey we have found  
Becoming one in a million  
Slip into the crowd  
This question I found in the gap in the sidewalk  
  
Keep all your sights on  
The black cat changing colors  
We can walk under ladders  
And swim as the tide choose to turn you  
  
And here I sit  
Life goes on, end of tunnel, TV set  
Spot in the middle  
Static fade, statistic bit  
And soon I'll fade away, I'll fade away  
  
This I admit  
Taste so good, hard to believe an end to it  
Smell touch feel  
How could this rhythm ever quit  
Bags packed on a plane  
Hopefully to heaven  
  
Shut up I'm thinking  
I had a clue now it's gone forever  
Sitting over these bones  
You can read in whatever you're needing to  
  
Keep all your sights on  
The big bad black cat that's  
Changing colors  
  
It's not the colors that matter  
But that they'll all fade away  
  
This I admit  
Seems so full  
Hard to believe an end to it  
Warehouse is bare  
Nothing at all inside of it  
Walls and halls have disappeared, they've disappeared  
  
My love I love to stay here  
My love I love to stay here  
My love I love to stay here  
My love I love to stay here  
In a corner was wondering...  
If a change could be better than this  
And then I worry  
Maybe things won't be better than they have been here  
Here in the warehouse  
  
At the warehouse  
How I love to stay here  
At the warehouse  
Every man and woman get alive  
  
That's our blood down there  
Seems poured from the hands of angels  
But trickle into the ground  
Leaves the warehouse bare and empty  
  
My heart's numbered beat  
Still echo in this empty room  
Fear wells in me  
But nothing seems enough to defend  
So I am going away...

Originally by phish  
  
Don't want to be an actor pretending on a stage,  
Don't want to be a writer with my thoughts out on a page,  
Don't want to be a painter cause everyone comes to look,  
Don't want to be anything when my lifes an open book,  
I dream it's true, but I see it through  
If I could be, wasting my time, with you  
Don't want to be a farmer working in the sun  
Don't want to be an outlaw always on the run  
Don't want to be a climber reaching for the top  
Don't want to be anything were I don't know when to stop  
I dream It's true, but I see it through  
If I could be wasting my time, with you, so if I'm inside your head  
Don't believe what you might have read, you'll see what I might have said  
To hear it, come waste your time with me, come waste your time with me  
Wasting my time with you, if I could be wasting my time with you  
So if I'm inside your head don't believe what you might have read  
Don't believe what you might have read, you'll see what I might have said  
To hear it, come waste your time with, come waste your time with me  
Come waste your time with me, wasting my time with you, if I could be wasting  
My time with you.

Up and down the puppies' hair  
Fleas and ticks jump everywhere  
'Cause of original sin  
  
Down the hill fell Jack and Jill  
And you came tumbling after  
'Cause of original sin  
  
Rip away the tears  
Drink a hope for happy years  
And you may find  
A lifetime's passed you by  
  
What would you say  
If you a monkey on a string  
If you a doggie on a chain  
What would you say  
  
I was there when the bear  
Ate his head, thought it was a candy  
Everyone goes in the end  
  
Knock knock on the door  
Who's it for, nobody in here  
Look in the mirror my friend  
  
I don't understand at best  
I cannot speak for all the rest  
In the morning rise a lifetime's passed me by  
  
What would you say  
(don't' drop the big one)  
If you a monkey on a string  
(Don't cut my life line)  
If you a doggie on a chain  
(Don't bite the mailman)  
What would you say  
  
Every dog has it's day every day has it's way  
Of being forgotten- "Mom it's my birthday"  
  
What would you say  
(don't' drop the big one)  
If you a monkey on a string  
(Don't cut my life line)  
If you a doggie on a chain  
(Don't bite the mailman)  
What would you say
