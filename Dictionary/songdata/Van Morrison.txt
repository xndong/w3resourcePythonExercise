I walked in my greatcoat  
Down through the days of the leaves.  
No before after, yes after before  
We were shining our light into  
The days of blooming wonder  
In the eternal presence,  
In the presence of the flame.  
  
Didn't I come to bring you a sense of wonder  
Didn't I come to lift your fiery vision bright  
Didn't I come to bring you a sense of wonder in the flame.  
  
On and on and on and on we kept singing our song  
Over newtonards and comber,  
Gransha and the Ballystockart Road.  
This spike an boffyflow  
I said I could describe the leaves  
For Samuel and Felicity  
Rich, red browny, half burnt orange and green.  
  
Didn't I come to bring you a sense of wonder  
Didn't I come to lift your fiery vision bright  
Didn't I come to bring you a sense of wonder in the flame.  
  
It's easy to describe the leaves in the autumn  
And it's oh so easy in the spring  
But down through January and February  
It's a very different thing.  
  
On and on and on, through the winter of our discontent.  
When the wind blows up the collar and the ears are frostbitten too  
I said I could describe the leaves for Samuel and what it means to you and me  
You may call my love Sophia, but I call my love philosophy.  
  
Didn't I come to bring you a sense of wonder  
Didn't I come to lift your fiery vision  
Didn't I come to bring you a sense of wonder in the flame.  
  
Didn't I come to bring you a sense of wonder  
Didn't I come to lift your fiery vision  
Didn't I come to bring you a sense of wonder in the flame.  
  
Wee Alfie at the castle picture house on the Castlereagh Road.  
Whistling on the corner next door where  
He kept Johnny McBride's horse.  
O solo mio by Mcgimsey  
And the man who played the saw  
Outside the city hall.  
Pastie suppers down at Davey's chipper  
Gravy rings, wagon wheels, barmbracks, snowballs.  
  
A sense of wonder  
A sense of wonder  
A sense of wonder

Copycats ripped off my words  
Copycats ripped off my songs  
Copycats ripped off my melody  
It doesn't matter what they say  
It doesn't matter what they do  
All that matters is my relationship to you  
  
Gonna take you out  
Get you in my car  
We're going for a long, long, long drive  
We're going down, to a town called Paradise  
Down where we can be free  
We're gonna drink that wine  
We're gonna jump for joy  
In a town called Paradise  
  
We're going up the mountainside  
Child you can look for miles  
And see the vision on the west  
We're gonna swing round  
And look north, south and east to west  
And go round in a circle too  
  
And we're gonna start dancing  
Like we've never done before  
I'm gonna take you in my arms  
I'm gonna squeeze you tight  
Everything will be alright  
We're gonna get that squealin' feelin'  
Take you down to a town called Paradise,  
Down where we, we can be free  
  
It doesn't matter what they say  
It doesn't matter what they do  
All that matters is my relationship to you  
By the river we will linger  
As we drive down to be free  
We're gonna ride all night long  
All along the ancient highway  
Gonna be there for the mornin' comes

Across the bridge where angels dwell  
Across the bridge where angels  
Across the bridge where angels dwell  
Children play  
  
Beyond the place where time is still  
Beyond the place where time is  
Beyond the place where time is still  
Night is day  
  
Close your eyes in fields of wonder  
Close your eyes and dream  
Close your eyes in fields of wonder  
Close your eyes and dream  
  
Along the path where heaven lies  
Along the path where heaven  
Along the path where heaven lies  
All is clear  
  
Ahead where home awaits the heart  
Ahead where home is waiting  
Ahead where home awaits the heart  
Peace is near  
  
Close your eyes in fields of wonder  
Close your eyes and dream  
Close your eyes in fields of wonder  
Close your eyes and dream  
  
Across the bridge where angels dwell  
Across the bridge where angels  
Across the bridge where angels dwell  
Children play

I'm Alabamy bound  
I'm Alabamy bound  
And if the train don't stop 'n turn around  
I'm Alabamy bound  
  
Don't you leave me here  
Don't you leave me here  
The locomos ghost suite pullin' out  
Leave a dime for a beer  
  
I'm Alabamy bound (I'm Alabamy bound)  
I'm Alabamy bound (I'm Alabamy bound)  
And if the train don't stop and turn around  
I'm Alabamy bound (I'm Alabamy bound)  
  
(Hair don't curl)  
And your eyes ain't blue  
'Cause if you don't want me, sweet Polly Ann  
(Well, I don't want you)  
  
Alabamy bound (I'm Alabamy bound)  
I'm Alabamy bound (I'm Alabamy bound)  
And if the train down stop and turn around

I'm Alabamy bound (don't cha leave me here)  
I'm Alabamy bound (don't cha leave me here)  
I'm Alabamy bound

Well I'm taking some time with my quiet friend  
Well I'm takin' some time on my own.  
Well I'm makin' some plans for my getaway  
There'll be blue skies shining up above  
When I'm cloud hidden  
Cloud hidden  
Whereabouts unknown  
  
Well I've got to get out of the rat-race now  
I'm tired of the ways of mice and men  
And the empires all turning into rust again.  
Out of everything nothing remains the same  
That's why I'm cloud hidden  
Cloud hidden  
Whereabouts unknown  
  
Sittin' up on the mountain-top in my solitude  
Where the morning fog comes rollin' in  
Just might do me some good.  
  
Well I'm waiting in the clearing with my motor on  
Well it's time to get back to the town again  
Where the air is sweet and fresh in the countryside  
Well it won't be long before I get back here again.

Here comes Sue and she looks crazy  
Skipping down the hillside gaily  
Looking like the flowers that bloom in May  
Won't you make your reservation?  
I will meet you at the station  
Won't you come and see me, All Saints Day?  
  
Follow my lead, it is no wonder, I seem to be so high  
Living my dreams the way I ought to  
As the days go rolling by  
See me strolling through the meadow  
With you baby by my side  
Won't you come and see me, All Saints Day?  
  
See the streamline blue horizon  
With you baby by the way  
Won't you come and see me, All Saints Day?  
You can make your reservation  
I will meet you at the station  
When you come to see me, All Saints Day  
  
When you come to see me, All Saints Day  
When you come to see me, All Saints Day.

All work and no play  
Makes Jack a dull chap  
When it comes to the crunch  
It s too much I've got to stop  
No pain and no gain it s driving me insane  
  
I d like to be somewhere else  
Like to be all by myself  
Like to be down at the beach  
Relaxing at the sugar shack  
Hot dogs coffee black  
Coca cola kicking back  
  
I'm just a wild and crazy guy  
But I m tearing at the seams  
Before you can say Jack Robinson  
I'll be seeing you in my dreams  
She's on a blanket with a book  
In the shade, white suit  
  
Happy hour at the bar  
And I m jamming with some friends  
We're up to the same tricks  
Drinking cocktails getting our kicks  
Later on by the pool  
Looking good ah, be cool  
  
There's no craic double back  
Moving on down the track  
Moving on down the line  
Got to chill out in style  
Got to ease my troubled mind  
Thinking just might be a crime  
  
All work and no play  
Makes Jack a dull chap  
When it comes to the crunch  
It's too much I've got to stop  
No pain no gain it's all going  
Down the drain

I can hear them calling way from Oregon  
I can hear them calling way from Oregon  
And it's almost Independence Day  
  
Me and my lady, we go steppin' (we go steppin')  
We go steppin' way out on China town  
All to buy some Hong Kong silver  
And the wadin' rushing river (we go steppin')  
We go out on the, out on the town tonight  
  
I can hear the fireworks  
I can hear the fireworks  
I can hear the fireworks  
Up and down the, up and down the San Francisco bay  
Up and down the, up and down the San Francisco bay  
I can hear them echoing  
I can hear, I can hear them echoing  
Up and down the, up and down the San Francisco bay  
  
I can see the boats in the harbor (way across the harbor)  
Lights shining out (lights shining out)  
And a cool, cool night  
And a cool, cool night across the harbor  
I can hear the fireworks  
I can hear the people, people shouting out  
I can hear the people shouting out (up and down the line)  
And it's almost Independence Day  
  
I can see the lights way out in the harbor  
And the cool, and the cool, and the cool night  
And the cool, and the cool, and the cool night breeze  
And I feel the cool night breeze  
And I feel, feel, feel the cool night breeze  
And the boats go by  
And it's almost Independence Day  
And it's almost, and it's almost Independence Day  
  
Way up and down the line  
Way up and down the line

There's a small cafe on the outskirts of town  
I'll be there when the sun goes down  
Where the roadside bends  
And it twists and turns  
Every new generation  
And I'll be praying to my higher self  
Don't let me down, keep my feet on the ground  
  
There's a roadside jam playin' on the edge of town  
In a town called Paradise near the ancient highway  
When the train whistle blows  
All the sadness that Hank Williams knows  
And the river flows  
Call them pagan streams and it spins and turns  
In a factory in a street called Bread in East Belfast  
Where Georgie knows best  
What it's like to be Daniel in the lion's den  
Got so many friends only most of the time  
  
When the grass is high and the rabbit runs  
Though it's talkin' to you and I  
And every new generation comes to pay  
The dues of the organ grinder jam  
And the grinder's switch of the sacrifice  
Everybody made to be rational with understanding  
And I'll be praying to my higher self  
Oh, don't let me down, keep my feet on the ground  
  
What about all the people living in the nightmare hurt  
That won't go away no matter how hard they try  
They've got to pay time and time again, time and time again  
I'll be praying to my higher self  
And I'll be standin' there, where the boats go by  
When the sun is sinking way over the hill  
On a Friday evening when the sun goes down  
On the outskirts of town, I want to slip away  
I want to slip away, got to get away  
And I'll be praying to my higher self  
Don't let me down, keep my feet on the ground, don't let me down  
  
You'll be cryin' again, you'll be cryin' again, you'll be cryin' again  
By the same wipe the teardrops from your eyes  
Have to slip away in the evening when the sun goes down  
Over the hill, with a sense of wonder  
Everything gonna be right on a Friday evening  
All the cars go by all along down  
The ancient highway  
And I'll be praying, I'll be praying to my higher self  
Don't let me down, keep my feet, keep my feet on the ground  
Keep my feet on the ground  
  
Traveling like a stranger in the night, all along the ancient highway  
Got you in my sights, got you on my mind  
I'll be praying in the evening when the sun goes down  
Over the mountain, got to get you right in my sight  
As the beams on the cars from the overpass  
On the ancient highway shine like diamonds in the night  
Like diamonds in the night  
I'll be praying to my higher self, to my higher self  
Don't let me down, don't let me down  
  
And you'll be standing there, while the boats go by  
While the boats go by on a Friday evening  
Shining your light, shining your light on a Friday evening  
Got to slip away, got to slip away down that ancient highway  
In a town called Paradise, in a town, in a town  
All along, all along that road, all along that road,  
All along that road with the trance like vision  
  
I'll be praying to my higher self, don't let me down, don't let me down  
Keep my feet on the ground, keep my feet on the ground,  
Keep my feet on the ground  
Friday evening got to slip away  
Watching the view from a car from the overpass  
And we're driving down that ancient road  
Shining like diamonds in the night, oh diamonds in the night  
All along the ancient highway  
Got you in my sight, got you in my mind  
Got you in my arms and I'm praying, and I'm gonna pray  
I'm gonna pray, to my higher self, ah don't let me down  
Don't let me down, give me the fire, ah give me the fire

Half a mile from the county fair  
And the rain keep pourin' down  
Me and Billy standin' there  
With a silver half a crown  
  
Hands are full of a fishin' rod  
And the tackle on our backs  
We just stood there gettin' wet  
With our backs against the fence  
  
Oh, the water  
Oh, the water  
Oh, the water  
Hope it don't rain all day  
  
[Chorus]  
And it stoned me to my soul  
Stoned me just like Jelly Roll  
And it stoned me  
And it stoned me to my soul  
Stoned me just like goin' home  
And it stoned me  
  
Then the rain let up and the sun came up  
And we were gettin' dry  
Almost let a pick-up truck nearly pass us by  
So we jumped right in and the driver grinned  
  
And he dropped us up the road  
We looked at the swim and we jumped right in  
Not to mention fishing poles  
  
Oh, the water  
Oh, the water  
Oh, the water  
Let it run all over me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
On the way back home we sang a song  
But our throats were getting dry  
Then we saw the man from across the road  
With the sunshine in his eyes  
  
Well he lived all alone in his own little home  
With a great big gallon jar  
There were bottles too, one for me and you  
And he said Hey! There you are  
  
Oh, the water  
Oh, the water  
Oh, the water  
Get it myself from the mountain stream  
  
[Chorus]

Angeliou oh Angeliou  
Oh oh Angeliou Angeliou  
Oh Angeliou oh Angeliou oh my Angeliou  
  
In the month of May  
In the month of May  
In the city of Paris  
In the month of May  
In the month of May  
In the city of Paris  
And I heard the bells ringing, and I heard the bells ringing  
In the month of May  
In the city of Paris and I called out your name  
  
In the month of May  
In the city of Paris  
In the month of May  
In the city of Paris  
Oh oh Angeliou oh Angeliou oh oh Angeliou oh my Angeliou  
  
Walkin' on a city street who would think you could ever be touched  
By a total stranger, not me  
But when you came up to me that day and I listened to your story  
It reminded me so much of myself  
It wasn't what you said but the way it felt to me  
About a search and a journey just like mine  
  
Will you be my baby  
Will you be my baby now  
Will you be my baby  
Will you be my baby now  
Angeliou oh Angeliou  
Angeliou oh Angeliou  
Yes I will yes I will yes I will  
After she told all these things to me I said I got a story too  
It goes something like this

Aryan mist  
Among the bridges  
You hang by the river  
You've been here forever  
Aryan mist  
  
What can the matter be  
In a world full of glamor  
Does it lift you up  
Or is it railway carriage charm  
  
You just sit here  
And look from your carriage  
As you watch the scene go by  
  
Gurus from the east  
Gurus from the west  
Does it lift you up  
Or is it railway carriage charm  
  
Aryan mist  
Among the bridges  
You hang by the river  
You've been here forever  
Aryan mist  
Aryan mist  
  
There's so many people  
Going down by the river  
Down by the river  
To get clean  
  
The fog of illusion  
The fog of confusion  
Is hanging all over the world  
  
Gurus from the east  
Gurus from the west  
Does it lift you up  
Or is it railway carriage charm  
  
Aryan mist  
You've been here forever  
Remind me of Krishna  
Love first sweet kiss  
Aryan mist  
  
Aryan mist  
Among the bridges  
You hang by the river  
You've been here forever  
Aryan mist  
  
Does it lift you up  
Or is it railway carriage charm

If I ventured in the slipstream  
Between the viaducts of your dream  
Where immobile steel rims crack  
And the ditch in the back roads stop  
Could you find me?  
Would you kiss-a my eyes?  
To lay me down  
In silence easy  
To be born again  
To be born again  
From the far side of the ocean  
If I put the wheels in motion  
And I stand with my arms behind me  
And I'm pushin' on the door  
Could you find me?  
Would you kiss-a my eyes?  
To lay me down  
In silence easy  
To be born again  
To be born again  
There you go  
Standin' with the look of avarice  
Talkin' to Huddie Ledbetter  
Showin' pictures on the wall  
Whisperin' in the hall  
And pointin' a finger at me  
There you go, there you go  
Standin' in the sun darlin'  
With your arms behind you  
And your eyes before  
There you go  
Takin' good care of your boy  
Seein' that he's got clean clothes  
Puttin' on his little red shoes  
I see you know he's got clean clothes  
A-puttin' on his little red shoes  
A-pointin' a finger at me  
And here I am  
Standing in your sad arrest  
Trying to do my very best  
Lookin' straight at you  
Comin' through, darlin'  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
If I ventured in the slipstream  
Between the viaducts of your dreams  
Where immobile steel rims crack  
And the ditch in the back roads stop  
Could you find me  
Would you kiss-a my eyes  
Lay me down  
In silence easy  
To be born again  
To be born again  
To be born again  
In another world  
In another world  
In another time  
Got a home on high  
Ain't nothing but a stranger in this world  
I'm nothing but a stranger in this world  
I got a home on high  
In another land  
So far away  
So far away  
Way up in the heaven  
Way up in the heaven  
Way up in the heaven  
Way up in the heaven  
In another time  
In another place  
In another time  
In another place  
Way up in the heaven  
Way up in the heaven  
We are goin' up to heaven  
We are goin' to heaven  
In another time  
In another place  
In another time  
In another place  
In another face

Leaves of brown they fall to the ground  
And it's here, over there leaves around  
Shut the door, dim the lights and relax  
What is more, your desire or the facts  
  
Pitter patter the rain falling down  
Little glamor sun coming round  
Take a walk when autumn comes to town  
  
Little stroll past the house on the hill  
Some more coal on the fire will do well  
And in a week or two it'll be Halloween  
Set the page and the stage for the scene  
  
Little game the children will play  
And as we watch them while time away  
Look at me and take my breath away yeah  
  
You'll be smiling eyes beguiling  
And the song on the breeze  
Will call my name out and your dream  
  
Chestnuts roasting outside as you walk  
With your love by your side  
The old accordion man plays mellow and bright  
And you go home in the crispness of the night  
  
Little later friends will be along  
And if you feel like joining the throng  
Just might feel like singing Autumn song  
Just may feel like singing Autumn song  
  
You'll be smiling  
Eyes beguiling  
And the song on the breeze  
Calls my name out in your dream  
  
Chestnuts roasting outside  
As you walk with your love by your side  
And the old accordion plays mellow and bright  
And you go home in the crispness of the night

I've been in this condition so many times before  
  
Back by my lonesome  
I'm right back by my lonesome  
Just watching th' people going from door to door  
  
I've got to change my ways  
And try to quit this place  
'Cause one of these rainy days  
I'm gonna need a friendly face  
  
I'm back on th' corner  
I'm right back on th' corner  
I've been in this condition so many times before  
  
I've got to change my ways  
And try to quit this place  
'Cause one of these rainy days  
I'm gonna be a mental case

You came to see me when the moon was new  
Saw you standin' in the pouring rain  
Left my message on the window pain  
Back on the street again  
Back on the beat again  
I'm back on the top again  
  
Saw me climbing to the top of the hill  
You saw me meeting with the fools on the hill  
Learned my lesson and I had my fill  
Learnt it all in vain  
Went through it all again  
Now I'm back on the top again  
  
Always strivin', always climbing way beyond my will  
Same old sensation, isolation at the top of the bill  
Always seeming, like I'm moving but I'm really going slow  
What do you do when you get to the top and there's nowhere to go  
  
Just how I get there will be anybody's guess  
With all the so called trappings of success  
Left all the deadbeats on the top of the hill  
Too busy raisin' Cain  
I'm back on the street again  
I'm back on the top again  
  
Always strivin', always climbing way beyond my will  
It's the same old sensation, isolation at the top of the hill  
Always seeming, like I'm moving but I'm really going slow  
You'll find out when you get to the top that there's nowhere to go  
  
How you get there will be anybody's guess  
With all the so called trappings of success  
Left all the deadbeats on the top of the hill  
Too busy raisin' Cain  
I'm back on the street again  
I'm back on the top again  
  
Back on my feet again  
I'm back on the street again  
I'm back on the top again

You didn't know I wasn't free  
When you fell in love with me  
And with all your young heart  
You learned to care  
  
It brought you shame and disgrace  
The world has tumbled in your face  
Because they call our love  
A back street affair  
  
They say you wrecked my home  
I'm a husband that's gone wrong  
They don't know the sorrow  
That we had to bear  
  
While the one I was tied to  
Was the first to be untrue  
How can they call our love  
A back street affair  
  
Well, we have each other now  
That's all that matters anyhow  
While the judgment  
Of gossips never fair  
  
We'll just be brave and strong  
Then someday they'll see they're wrong  
So, let them call our love  
A back street affair  
  
We'll be free to love someday  
When all the talk has died away  
And the happiness we hoped for  
Then we'll share  
  
And I'll climb a mountain high  
And the world will hear me cry  
That our love is not  
A backstreet affair

Everybody got some soul  
I don't care if they're young or old

Get out, get out, jump and shout

Just say yeah (bad or good)  
Oh yeah (bad or good)  
And it's alright baby (bad or good)

If I paint the lashes dark  
And the eyes more bright  
And your lips more scarlet  
Ask if it'll all be right  
And it's mirror after mirror  
No vanities displayed  
You're just looking for the face you had  
Before the world was made  
Before the world was made  
Before the world was made  
  
And if I look upon you now  
As though I have my view  
With the earth beneath your feet  
And heaven up above  
Would you think me cruel  
After everything's been said  
You're only looking for the face you had  
Before the world was made  
Before the world was made  
Before the world was made  
  
And if I paint the lashes dark  
And your eyes more bright  
And your lips more scarlet  
Ask if it'll all be right  
And it's mirror after mirror  
No vanities displayed  
I'm just looking for the face you had  
Before the world was made  
Before the world was made  
Before the world was made  
  
Your original face  
Before time and space  
Your original face  
Before time and space  
Your original, original face  
Before the world was made  
Before the world was made  
Before the world was made

It's not easy bein' green  
Having to spend each day the color of the leaves  
When I think it could be nicer bein' red or yellow or gold  
Or something much more colorful like that  
  
It's not easy bein' green  
It seems you blend in with so many other ordinary things  
And people tend to pass you over  
Cause you're not standing out like flashy sparkles  
On the water or stars in the sky  
  
But green is the color of spring  
And green can be cool and friendly like  
And green can be big like an ocean  
Or important like a mountain or tall like a tree  
  
When green is all there is to be  
It could make you wonder why  
But why wonder, why wonder?  
I am green and it'll do fine, it's beautiful  
And I think it's what I want to be

My message this evenin'  
Is simple indeed  
Wherever you wander  
Whatever your breed  
There's just one thing baby  
That comes from above  
When push comes to shove  
Thank God for self love  
  
Thank Him, Thank Him  
God for self love  
Thank Him, Thank Him  
God for self love  
When push comes to shove  
Thank God for self love  
  
When livin' gets heavy  
And hope starts to fade  
You just can't continue  
That old masquerade  
Remember the power that comes from above  
When push comes to shove  
Thank God for self love  
  
Thank Him, Thank Him  
God for self love  
Thank Him, Thank Him  
God for self love  
When push comes to shove  
Thank God for self love

Little Jimmy's gone  
Way out of the backstreet  
Out of the window  
Through the fallin' rain  
Right on time  
Right on time  
That's why Broken Arrow  
Waved his finger down the road so dark and narrow  
In the evenin'  
Just before the Sunday six-bells chime, six-bells chime  
And all the dogs are barkin'  
Way on down the diamond-studded highway where you wander  
And you roam from your retreat and view  
Way over on the railroad  
Tomorrow all the tippin' trucks will unload  
Every scrapbook stuck will glue  
And I'll stand beside you  
Beside you child  
To never never never wonder why at all  
No no no no no no no no  
To never never wonder why at all  
To never never never wonder why it's gotta be  
It has to be  
Way across the country where the hillside mountain glide  
The dynamo of your smile caressed the barefoot virgin child to wander  
Past your window with a lantern lit  
You held it in the doorway and you cast against the pointed island breeze  
Said your time was open, go well on your merry way  
Past the brazen footsteps of the silence easy  
You breathe in you breathe out you breathe in you breathe out you breath in  
You breathe out you breathe in you breathe out  
And you're high on your high-flyin' cloud  
Wrapped up in your magic shroud as ecstasy surrounds you  
This time it's found you  
You turn around you turn around you turn around you turn around  
And I'm beside you  
Beside you  
Oh darlin'  
To never never wonder why at all  
No no no no no  
To never never never wonder why at all  
To never never never wonder why it's gotta be  
It has to be  
And I'm beside you  
Beside you  
Oh child  
To never never wonder why at all  
I'm beside you  
Beside you  
Beside you  
Beside you  
Oh child

Blue diamonds, big blue diamonds on her finger  
Instead of a little band of gold  
Big diamonds, big blue diamonds tell the story  
Of the love that no one man could hold  
  
Oh, she wanted more than I had money to buy  
So she left me sad and lonely I am told  
Big diamonds, big blue diamonds  
Now she'll trade them  
For a love behind a little band of gold  
  
Blue diamonds, big blue diamonds how they sparkle  
But what can they do to warm your heart and soul  
When you're lonesome in the moonlight and you want loving  
Big blue diamonds don't they seem so reckless and bold  
  
I gladly do my part oh, to mend a broken heart  
But a love that's warmed over soon grows cold  
Big diamonds, big blue diamonds  
I don't want them, no  
Oh for a love behind a little band of gold

Well, they told me to come on over  
I made my way to New York  
And they tried to have me deported  
Stop me from getting work  
Blacklisted me all over  
They were vicious and they were mean  
They were big time operators  
Baby, on the music business scene  
  
Oh, they looked like politicians  
But underneath they were thugs  
And they spread malicious rumors  
Threatened to have me busted for drugs  
They had nothing on me  
Oh man, I was really clean  
But they were big time operators  
On the music business scene  
  
They put a bug in my apartment  
To listen in on my calls  
I was looking for some motivation  
I couldn't find any, any motivation at all  
They were very desperate people  
Riding in long black limousines  
But they were big time operators  
On the music business scene  
  
They were glorified by the media  
They were heroes who had names  
They said that they would bury me  
If I didn't play their game  
They said I didn't know the score  
And that I was young and green  
They were big game operators  
On the music business scene  
  
Tried to hold me to a phony contract  
I said I didn't agree  
Had to get out of the clutches  
Had to go underground you see  
Now I'm living in another country  
But I know exactly just where I've been  
Stay away from big time operators  
Baby, on the music business scene  
  
Well, baby big time operators  
On the music business scene  
Oh baby, big time operators  
On the music business scene  
Well, full of names and places  
Baby, you know who I mean

My mama done tol' me  
When I was a little  
My mama done told me, son  
A woman will sweet talk  
And give you the big eye  
But when that sweet talk is done  
A woman's a two faced  
A woman's something that would leave you singing the blues in the night  
  
Now the rain is falling  
Heaven can hear you calling  
Doo wee  
Heaven blows the lonesome whistle  
Blowing across the threshold  
Doo wee  
Doo wee ta too tee  
A crickety crack go wickety wack the blues in the night  
  
Evening breeze will start  
Trees that crying in the  
All in the world wood haunted slide  
When you get the blues in the night  
  
So take my word  
Or the mocking bird  
Will sing a sadder kind of song  
Maybe he knows things  
He knows things can go wrong  
  
A match is a maybe  
Love is the same job  
Whenever the four winds blow  
I've been to some big town  
Had me some big town  
But there is one thing I know  
A woman's a two faced  
A woman's something that would leave you singing the blues in the night  
Blues in the night

When I first came to town, people  
I was walking down Hasting Street  
Everybody was talkin' about, Henry Swing Club  
I decided to stop in there for awhile  
And man, when I got there  
Yeah, they were really havin' a ball  
  
Well, I feel so good  
I want to boogie, I want to boogie, I want to boogie  
Well, to the break of day  
(Say, it again)  
  
Well, I feel so good  
I want to boogie, I want to boogie, I want to boogie  
Well, to the break of day  
(Alright)  
  
When I was a young boy  
I was layin' down one night  
And I heard ma and pa talkin'  
I heard pa tell ma  
"Hey, come on, let that boy boogie-woogie  
'Cause you know it's in him  
And it's just got to come out"  
'Cause it's in him  
And it's just got to come out  
  
Well, feels so good, child  
I want to boogie, I want to boogie, I want to boogie  
Lord, 'til the break-a day  
(Chillein', I'm chillin' here)  
  
Well, feels so good, now Lord  
I want to boogie, I want to boogie, I want to boogie  
Yeah-ow, 'til the break of day

Man can be king  
Seems to have everything

When you were born to sing  
  
Reason doesn't walk in  
It's not done on a whim  
Passion's everything

Reason doesn't walk in  
It's not done on a whim  
Passion's everything  
When you were born to sing  
  
Lord, feeling good  
Singing the blues

Paying them dues  
  
When it comes to the part

Then you know everything  
'cause you were born to sing  
  
When it gets to the part  
When the band starts to swing  
Then you know everything  
'cause you were born to sing

When all the dark clouds roll away  
And the sun begins to shine  
I see my freedom from across the way  
And it comes right in on time  
Well it shines so bright and it gives so much light  
And it comes from the sky above  
Makes me feel so free makes me feel like me  
And lights my life with love  
  
[Chorus:]  
And it seems like and it feels like  
And it seems like yes it feels like  
A brand new day, yeah  
A brand new day oh  
  
I was lost and double crossed  
With my hands behind my back  
I was longtime hurt and thrown in the dirt  
Shoved out on the railroad track  
I've been used, abused and so confused  
And I had nowhere to run  
But I stood and looked  
And my eyes got hooked  
On that beautiful morning sun  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And the sun shines down all on the ground  
Yeah and the grass is oh so green  
And my heart is still and I've got the will  
And I don't really feel so mean  
Here it comes, here it comes  
0 here it comes right now  
And it comes right in on time  
Well it eases me and it pleases me  
And it satisfies my mind  
  
[Chorus]

From the dark end of the street  
To the bright side of the road  
We'll be lovers once again on the  
Bright side of the road  
  
Little darlin', come with me  
Won't you help me share my load  
From the dark end of the street  
To the bright side of the road  
  
Into this life we're born  
Baby sometimes, bay sometimes we don't know why  
And time seems to go by so fast  
In the twinkling of an eye  
  
Let's enjoy it while we can  
Won't you help me sing my song  
From the dark end of the street  
To the bright side of the road  
  
From the dark end of the street  
To the bright side of the road  
We'll be lovers once again  
On the bright side of the road  
We'll be lovers once again  
On the bright side of the road  
We'll be lovers once again  
On the bright side of the road

Spoken:  
All these wise guys trying to put us down  
We gonna bring 'em on in  
An' bring 'em on home  
  
Sings:  
See them stumbling by the way side  
See them stumbling by the way side  
Though it won't sail, 'cross the water, yeah  
Row-in boats a-cross the water  
Pick them up baby, row them on  
Bring 'em on in, bring 'em on home  
  
Well, I was driving, in my Jag-you-are  
Do-in' ninety miles an hour  
I was driving up a clear way  
It was just my luckiest day  
An I, kept speed up  
An I, rowed these boats  
A-bring 'em on in  
A-bring 'em on in  
  
Bi-do-a, di-do-a, di-do-a-do  
  
Now, I went walking down by Queensway  
When I met a friend of mine  
He said, "Come on back, back to my pad  
We will have a nice time  
If you pick me up, row me on  
Bring me in, bring me in  
  
When I stepped off the boat  
And I walked upon the, dry land  
Slowly, to the car park  
And I jumped in, out of my mind  
Out of my mind  
Bring 'em in, bring 'em on in, bring 'em in  
  
Ay-o-lotta, o-li-otta, o-li-otta, o-li-otta  
O-li-otta, o-ah

Hey-hey now

Bring 'em on home, all right  
Bring 'em on home

Row me home, bring me in, hey

O-la-te-do-da-la

Hey where did we go,  
Days when the rains came  
Down in the hollow,  
Playin' a new game,  
Laughing and a running hey, hey  
Skipping and a jumping  
In the misty morning fog with  
Our hearts a thumpin' and you  
My brown eyed girl,  
You're my brown eyed girl.  
  
Whatever happened  
To Tuesday and so slow  
Going down the old mine  
With a transistor radio  
Standing in the sunlight laughing,  
Hiding behind a rainbow's wall,  
Slipping and sliding  
All along the water fall, with you  
My brown eyed girl,  
You're my brown eyed girl.  
  
Do you remember when we used to sing,  
Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da  
Just like that  
Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da, la te da  
  
So hard to find my way,  
Now that I'm all on my own.  
I saw you just the other day,  
My how you have grown,  
Cast my memory back there, Lord  
Sometime I'm overcome thinking 'bout  
Making love in the green grass  
Behind the stadium with you  
My brown eyed girl  
You're my brown eyed girl  
  
Do you remember when we used to sing  
Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da (lying in the green grass)  
Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da (bit, bit, bit, bit, bit, bit)  
Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da (sha la la la la la...)  
Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da

I'm kicking off from center field  
A question of being down for the game  
The one shot deal don't matter  
And the other one's the same  
  
Oh! My friend I see you  
Want you to come through (alright)  
And she's standing in the shadows  
Where the street lights all turn blue  
  
She leaving for an American (uhuh)  
Suitcase in her hand  
I said her brothers and her sisters  
Are all on Atlantic sand  
  
She's screaming through the alley way  
I hear the lonely cry, why can't you?  
And her batteries are corroded  
And her hundred watt bulb just blew  
  
Lallallal, alright, huhuhhuh  
  
She used to hang out at Miss Lucy's  
Every weekend they would get loose  
And it was a straight clear case of  
Having taken in too much juice  
  
It was outside, and it was outside  
Just the nature of the person  
Now all you got to remember  
After all, it's just show biz  
  
Lallalal, huhuh, lallal  
  
We're just screaming through the alley way  
I hear her lonely cry, ah why can't you?  
And she's standing in the shadows  
Canal street lights all turn blue  
And she's standing in the shadows  
Where the street lights all turn blue  
And she's standing in the shadows  
Down where the street lights all turn blue  
Hey, hey, yeah

And I take you down to the burning ground  
And you change me up and you turned it around  
In the wind and rain I'm gonna see you again  
In the morning sun and when the day is done  
And you take my hand and you walk with me  
Sometimes it feels like eternity  
And I turn the tide I get back my pride  
And I make you proud won't you say it out loud  
When I take you down to the burning ground  
To the burning ground, to the burning ground  
To the burning ground, to the burning ground  
  
And I take you down by the factory  
And I show you like it has to be  
And you understand how the work is done  
And I pick up the sack in the midday sun  
And I pull you through by the skin of your teeth  
And I lift the veil, I see what's underneath  
And you return to me and you sit on your throne  
And you make me feel that I'm not alone  
  
And I take you down to the burning ground  
To the burning ground, to the burning ground  
To the burning ground  
  
Hey man, what's that you're carrying?  
  
Feels like lead  
  
It weighs a ton, let's see if we can dump it by the side of the hill  
  
Hey wait up, why don't you dump it on the burning ground  
  
Dump it down there  
  
Yeh man, dump the Jute  
  
Hey man dump the Jute on the burning ground  
  
Dump the Jute?  
  
Yeh you know, dump the Jute  
  
Dump the Jute!  
  
On the burning ground  
On the burning ground  
And you make me think what it's all about  
Sometimes I know gonna work it out  
And I watch you run in the crimson sun  
Tear my shirt apart open up my heart  
And I watch you run  
Down on your bended knees  
By the burnt out well  
Can you tell me please  
Between heaven and hell  
Won't you take me down  
  
To the burning ground, to the burning ground  
To the burning ground, to the burning ground  
  
And you fall and pray, when you hear that sound  
As we're walking back to the burial mound  
And you shake your head and you turn it around  
And you see the flames from the burning ground  
And you get down on your knees and pray  
And I catch my breath as we're running away  
And I take the Jute and I throw him down  
  
On the burning ground, on the burning ground  
On the burning ground, it's on the burning ground.

You've got to try, for the kingdom  
You've got to try, for the kingdom  
On high, you've got to try,  
By His grace, by His grace  
  
You've got to live your religion  
Deep inside, when you try  
For the kingdom on high  
By His grace, by His grace  
  
Open your mind to the wisdom  
When you try for the kingdom, on high  
By His grace, by His grace  
  
Open your heart to the wisdom  
In your mind when you try  
For the kingdom on high  
By His grace, by His grace  
  
One day at a time, you got to try  
Open your eye, it will come  
By and by, when you try  
By His grace, by His grace  
By His grace, by His grace.

Well I've tried and I've tried  
But the river seems so wide  
And my head hurts and my hands are tied  
And it's so hard  
When you're standing on the yard  
Every time that your number comes around  
  
[Chorus]  
Call me up in dreamland  
Radio to me man  
Get the message to me  
Any way you can  
Let your river roll  
Way down to your soul  
Never to grow old  
On a saxophone  
  
From the airport to the plane  
Way to the railroad train  
Why don't we take it from the top  
And start over all over again  
Every time you hear that whistle blow  
You know you gotta put on your show  
Every time your number comes around  
  
[Chorus]  
  
From the car to the bar  
Why don't you pour it in a jar  
And put a label on it  
And send it off to the lost and found  
You gotta get it in your brain  
Before you go insane  
Every time your number comes around  
  
[Chorus]  
Never to grow old  
On a saxophone  
Never to grow old  
On a saxophone  
Never to grow old  
On a saxophone

Call my name, yeah yeah yeah, and I'll be there  
Right there, where I belong

I wished I had you in Carrickfergus,  
Only for nights in Ballygrand,  
I would swim over the deepest ocean,  
The deepest ocean to be by your side.  
  
But the sea is wide and I can't swim over  
And neither have I wings to fly.  
I wish I could find me a handy boatman  
To ferry me over to my love and die.  
  
My childhood days bring back sad reflections  
Of happy days so long ago.  
My boyhood friends and my own relations.  
Have all passed on like the melting snow.  
  
So I'll spend my days in endless roving,  
Soft is the grass and my bed is free.  
Oh to be home now in Carrickfergus,  
On the long road down to the salty sea.  
  
And in Kilkenny it is reported  
On marble stone there as black as ink,  
With gold and silver I did support her  
But I'll sing no more now till I get a drink.  
  
I'm drunk today and I'm rarely sober,  
A handsome rover from town to town.  
Oh but I am sick now and my days are numbered  
Come all ye young men and lay me down.

Carry on regardless, in spite of the music business scam  
Carry on regardless, in spite of all the petty minded little women and men  
Carry on regardless, when everybody don't give a damn  
  
Carry on and start all over again, in spite of all the TV trash  
Carry on regardless, in spite of all the media rehash  
And the white wash, the brain wash and all the white trash  
  
Carry on regardless, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby when your on a roll  
Carry on regardless, just to satisfy your soul

To keep carryin' a torch  
  
Flame of love it burns so bright

Higher and higher

If I don't see you through the week  
See you through the window  
See you next time that we're talking on the telephone  
And if I don't see you in that Indian summer  
Then I want to see you further on up the road  
  
I said, oh won't you come back?  
I have to see you my dear  
Want you come back in the Celtic New Year?  
In the Celtic New Year  
  
If I don't see you when I'm going down Louisiana  
If I don't see you when I'm down on Bourbon Street  
If you don't see me when I'm singing Jack of Diamonds  
If you don't see me when I'm on my lucky streak  
  
Woa, I want you, want you to come on back  
I've made it very clear  
I want you to come back home in the Celtic New Year  
Celtic New Year  
  
If I don't see you when the bonfires are burning, burning  
If I don't see you when we're singing the Gloriana tune  
If I've got to see you when it's raining deep inside the forest  
I got to see you at the waning of the moon  
  
Said oh, won't you come on back?  
Want you to be of good cheer  
Come back home on the Celtic New Year  
  
Celtic New Year, Celtic New Year  
Celtic New Year  
In the Celtic New Year  
In the Celtic New Year  
  
Come on home, come on home, come on home, come on home  
In the Celtic New Year

When Lewellyn comes around  
And he goes through Market Town  
You'll be on the Celtic Ray

Where the light comes shining through  
On the Celtic Ray

Can't we find a place?  
In a crowded room, we go  
  
Boom, chicka-boom, chicka-boom  
(Chicka-boom, chicka-boom)  
Boom (chicka-boom, chicka-boom-boom)  
Boom, chicka-boom, chicka-boom

A-hey, girl!

But I'm comin' back  
With a ginger cat  
What'd ya think a-that?  
  
Hey, girl!  
I'm goin' away  
But I'm comin' back  
By the railroad track  
  
Where the trains go by  
And we sang and cry in gloom  
Boom, chicka-boom  
(Chicka-boom, chicka-boom)  
  
Hey, girl!  
(Chicka-boom, chick-a boom-boom)  
When ya swish and sway  
(Chicka, chicka, chicka-boom)  
In your yellow dress  
'Cross the crowded room, boom  
  
Boom, chicka-boom, chicka-boom

You wired the trains and went back home to St. Claire's shores  
Before you became a spark down at the yard  
You were passing through those hungry years alone  
You were just trying to make a living out in Detroit  
  
When you came back off the boats you didn't want to go anywhere  
You sit down to TV in your favorite chair  
You watch the big picture fade away down at Harland and Wolff  
But you still kept on choppin' wood  
  
And you came back home to Belfast  
So you could be with us like  
You lived your life of quiet desperation on the side  
Going to the shipyard in the morning on your bike  
  
Well the spark was gone but you carried on  
You always did the best you could  
You sent for us once but everything fell through  
But you still kept on choppin' wood choppin' wood  
  
Well you came back home to Belfast  
So you could be with us like  
And you lived a life of quiet desperation on the side  
Going to the shipyard in the morning on your bike  
  
Well the spark was gone but you carried on  
Well you did just the best that you could  
You sent for us one time but everything fell through  
But you still kept on choppin' wood  
  
Kept on choppin'wood  
Kept on choppin' wood  
Local man chops wood  
You know you did the best you could  
  
Well everything just fell through  
Kept on choppin' wood  
Chop, chop, chop, chop, chop,  
Chop, chop, chop, chop, chop,  
Chop, chop, chop, keep on choppin'  
Chop, chop, chop, choppin' wood

Oh, the smell of the bakery from across the street  
Got in my nose  
As we carried our ladders down the street  
With the wrought-iron gate rows  
I went home and listened to Jimmie Rodgers in my lunch-break  
Bought five Woodbines at the shop on the corner  
And went straight back to work.  
  
Oh, Sam was up on top  
And I was on the bottom with the V  
We went for lemonade and Paris buns  
At the shop and broke for tea  
I collected from the lady  
And I cleaned the fanlight inside-out  
I was blowing saxophone on the weekend  
In that down joint.  
  
What's my line?  
I'm happy cleaning windows  
Take my time  
I'll see you when my love grows  
Baby don't let it slide  
I'm a working man in my prime  
Cleaning windows (number a hundred and thirty-six)  
  
I heard Leadbelly and Blind Lemon  
On the street where I was born  
Sonny Terry, Brownie McGhee,  
Muddy Waters singin' "I'm A Rolling Stone"  
I went home and read my Christmas Humphreys' book on Zen  
Curiosity killed the cat  
Kerouac's "Dharma Bums" and "On The Road"  
  
What's my line?  
I'm happy cleaning windows  
Take my time  
I'll see you when my love grows  
Baby don't let it slide  
I'm a working man in my prime  
Cleaning windows

I waited for you  
You waited for me  
That it seemed like, seemed like a mighty long time  
  
Baby I had to have you  
Oh, I had to have you  
Come rain, rain or shine  
  
It was a cold wind in August  
Shivers up and down my spine  
I was standin' in your garden  
In the California pine  
  
I was standing shivering  
I've got the fever in the rain  
But I can't come on back to see you  
Again and again and again  
  
I said I, I had to have you  
Baby I had to have you  
Come rain, come rain or shine  
  
It was a cold wind in August  
Shivers up and down my spine  
And I was standing in your garden  
  
In the California pine  
California pine  
  
It was a cold wind in August  
Shivers up and down my spine  
I was standin' in your garden  
In the California pine  
In the California pine It was a cold wind in August  
I was pushed on through September  
Oh pushin' through September  
In the rain  
Pushin' through, pushin' through September  
In the rain  
  
Ooh  
It was a cold wind in August  
Shivers up and down my spine  
I was standin', standin' in your garden  
In the California pine

Come here my love  
This feeling has me spellbound  
Yet the storyline, in paragraphs,  
Laid down the same  
In fathoms of my inner mind  
I'm mystified, oh, by this mood  
This melancholy feeling  
That just don't do no good  
  
Come here my love  
And I will lift my spirits high for you  
I'd like to fly away and spend a day or two  
Just contemplating the fields and leaves  
And talking about nothing  
Just layin' down in shades of effervescent, effervescent odors  
And shades of time and tide  
And flowing through  
Become enraptured by the sights and sounds  
In intrigue of nature's beauty  
Come along with me  
And take it all in  
Come here my love

By the side of the tracks where the train goes by  
The wind and the rain will catch you, you will sigh  
Deep in your heart  
Then you'll come a-running to me  
You'll come a-running to me  
Well you watch the train go 'round the bend  
Play in dust and dream that it will never end  
Deep in your heart  
You'll come a-running to me  
You'll come a-running to me  
Said, hey, come a-running to me  
Oh, come a-running to me  
Yeah, come a-running to me  
Said, hey, come a-running to me  
Oh, come a-running to me  
Hey, yeah, come a-running to me  
With your hound dog by your side  
And your arms stretched out open wide  
I want to keep you satisfied in the morning sun  
By my side, come on, come on run  
And you kick the sand up with your heels  
You think to yourself how good it feels  
Put away all your walking shoes  
Then you come running to me  
Now you come running to me  
I said, hey, come a-running to me  
Oh, come a-running to me  
Hey, yeah, come a-running to me  
You gotta rainbow if you run to me

I want to comfort you  
I want to comfort you  
I want to comfort you  
Just let your tears run wild  
Like when you were a child  
  
I'll do what I can do  
I want to comfort you  
You put the weight on me  
You put the weight on me  
You put the weight on me  
  
When it gets too much for me  
When it gets too much, much too much for me  
I'll do the same thing that you do  
And I'll put the weight on you  
Huh  
I'll put the weight on you  
I'll put the weight on you  
  
And I'll do the same thing that you do  
I'll put the weight on you  
I want to comfort you  
I want to comfort you  
  
And I want to comfort you  
Just let your tears run wild  
Like when you were a child  
I'll do what I can do  
I just want to comfort you

Coney Island  
Coming down from Downpatrick  
Stopping off at St. John's Point  
Out all day birdwatching  
And the craic was good  
Stopped off at Strangford Lough  
Early in the morning  
Drove through Shrigley taking pictures  
And on to Killyleagh  
Stopped off for Sunday papers at the Lecale District,  
Just before Coney Island  
  
On and on, over the hill to Ardglass  
In the jam jar, autumn sunshine, magnificent  
And all shining through  
  
Stop off at Ardglass for a couple of jars of  
Mussels and some potted herrings in case  
We get famished before dinner  
  
On and on, over the hill and the craic is good  
Heading towards Coney Island  
  
I look at the side of your face as the sunlight comes  
Streaming through the window in the autumn sunshine  
And all the time going to Coney Island I'm thinking,  
Wouldn't it be great if it was like this all the time.

Contacting my angel, contacting my angel  
She's the one, she's the one, that satisfies  
Contacting my angel she's the one that satisfies  
She's the one that I adore  
  
In a telepathic message for my baby  
In a little village, through the fog  
Here comes my baby, I can tell, I can tell  
By the way she walks  
Said I've been on a journey up the mountain side  
And I drank the water from the stream  
It was pure, pure water and I got completely healed  
  
I met a presence on the mountain side  
And he looked so radiant and he was the  
Youth of eternal summers  
Like a sweet bird of youth in my soul  
In my soul, in my soul, in my soul, in my soul  
In my soul, in my soul, in my soul

Puerto Rican nursery rhymes  
Angels in the snow and thyme  
And I'm keeping my mind on that rose  
In a church in Spanish Harlem  
  
Got watchtowers and awakes for free  
In the laundromat for you and me  
But you can't take me down that way  
As I'm not sinking  
  
And if we go down one time  
Next times not gonna be the last time  
And I'm contemplating that rose  
In a church in Spanish Harlem  
Didn't I bring you precious gifts  
Came to kiss you on the lips  
Didn't even appear  
To beg your pardon  
  
To lay out in the morning sun  
Feel the cool breeze and the one  
Right there in, in my garden  
Puerto Rican nursery rhymes  
And angels, and angels, and the snow and thyme  
But I'm keeping my mind on that rose  
In a church in Spanish Harlem  
  
Yeah, and if we go, if we go down one time  
The next time will not be the last time, and I'm  
Keeping my mind on that, contemplating that rose  
Up in a church in Spanish Harlem  
  
And if we go down one time, you know  
The next time it won't be the last time  
And I'm contemplating that rose  
In a church in Spanish Harlem  
  
And I'm contemplating that rose  
In a church in Spanish Harlem  
And I'm contemplating, and I'm contemplating that rose  
In a church in Spanish Harlem  
And I'm contemplating that rose  
In a church in Spanish Harlem  
And I'm contemplating that rose  
In a church, in a church in Spanish Harlem

Every time I see you walkin' down my avenue  
I say, "Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, are you all right?"  
And you say, "How do ya do?"  
Just like ya always do  
And if I had ya in my arms tonight  
  
Could you, a-would you

The sweet words you long to hear?

Just, just, just like I love you, baby  
Just, just, just like I love you

We stood and watched the river flow  
We were too young to really know  
In the country fair  
Oh, in the country fair  
  
We laid out in the long green grass  
And never thought that it would pass  
In the country fair  
In the country fair  
  
On an old, on an old open day  
On an old rain shine open day  
In the country fair  
In the cool night air  
In sweet summer time  
  
We counted pebbles in the sand  
Sand like time slippin' through our hand  
In the country fair  
In the country fair  
  
On an old, on an old open day  
On an old rain track open day  
In the country fair  
In the cool night air  
In sweet summer time  
  
Hmmm mmmm  
On an old open day  
On an old  
Pine cone open day

Now blue ain't the word for the way that I feel  
That old storm brewin' in this heart of mine  
Someday, your crazy arms will hold somebody new  
But now, I'm so lonesome all the time  
  
Crazy arms that reach to hold somebody new  
While your yearnin' heart keeps sayin'  
You're not mine (not mine)  
  
My troubled mind grows blue  
To another, you'll be wed  
But now I'm so lonesome, all the time  
  
Now take all those precious dreams  
I had for you and me  
And take all the love I thought was mine  
Someday, your crazy arms will hold somebody new  
But now, I'm so lonesome all the time  
  
Crazy arms that reach to hold somebody new  
But my yearnin' heart keeps sayin'  
You're not mine (not mine)  
My troubled mind grows blue  
To another you'll be wed  
And now I'm so lonesome all the time  
  
And now, I'm so lonesome all the time  
Yeah, now I'm so lonesome all the time

All the people were waiting for crazy face  
He said he'd meet them at his favorite place  
Dressed in black stain, white linen and lace  
With his head held high and a smile on his face  
  
He said:  
Ladies and Gentlemen, the prince is late  
As he stood outside the church-yard gate  
And polished up on his .38 and said  
I got it from Jesse James  
  
All the people were waiting for Crazy Face  
He said he'd meet them at his favorite place  
Dresses in black stain, white linen and lace  
With his head held high and a smile on his face  
  
And he said:  
Ladies and Gentlemen, the prince is late  
As he stood outside the church-yard gate  
And polished up on his .38 and said

I can hear her heart beat from a thousand miles  
And the heavens open every time she smiles  
And when I come to her that's where I belong  
Yet I'm running to her like a river's song  
  
[Chorus:]  
She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love  
She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love  
  
She's got a fine sense of humor when I'm feeling low down  
And when I come to her when the sun goes down  
Take away my trouble, take away my grief  
Take away my heartache, in the night like a thief  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yes I need her in the daytime  
Yes I need her in the night  
Yes I want to throw my arms around her  
Kiss her hug her kiss her hug her tight  
  
And when I'm returning from so far away  
She gives me some sweet lovin' brighten up my day  
Yes it makes me righteous, yes it makes me feel whole  
Yes it makes me mellow down in to my soul  
  
[Chorus]

I'll be waiting  
I'll be waiting on that shore  
To hear the cry for home  
You won't have to worry anymore  
When you hear the cry for home  
  
When you hear, hear the call  
You won't have to fake at all  
Hear the cry for home  
  
I'll be standing  
I'll be standing within reach  
When you hear, hear the call  
  
I'll be waiting  
I'll be waiting in the breach  
For you, when you hear  
  
When you hear, hear the call  
You won't have to fake at all  
Hear the cry for home  
  
When I listen  
When I listen to the song  
Well it feels, it feels so free  
  
And you tell me  
You will come and go with me  
When you hear the cry for home  
  
When you hear the call  
You won't have to think at all  
Hear the cry for home  
Spoken (one more, one more time)  
When you hear, hear the call  
You won't have to fake at all  
Hear the cry for home  
(One more open it up, open it up)  
When you hear, hear the call  
You won't have to fake at all  
Hear the cry for home  
Hear (When you hear, hear the call)  
Hear (When you hear, hear the call)  
Hear (When you hear, hear the call)  
Hear (When you hear, hear the call)  
Hear (When you hear, hear the call)  
Hear (When you hear, hear the call)

In the cul de sac, so smooth  
I look down  
Be less sure, sir  
And take your rest  
  
It's been much too long  
Since we drifted in song  
Lay it down wet  
In this hide-away  
  
Oh I traveled far  
To the nearest star  
And met Palomar, mar, mar  
And we don't care just who you know  
It's who you are  
And when they all go home  
Down the cobblestones  
You can double back (spoken "This is it")  
To a cul de sac  
Mmm  
  
Oh, I traveled far  
The nearest star  
And Mount Palomar, Palomar, Palomar, Palomar  
And we don't care just who d'you know who d'you know  
And who you really are, really are  
  
And when they all,  
All go home  
Down the cobblestones  
You will double back  
To a cul de sac  
You know, you know you will  
You will, oh, will double back  
And not very far  
To a cul de sac  
You, you, you, will double back  
To a cul de sac  
You know, you know it's not very far away  
No, no  
It's just a cul de sac  
  
And you know, and you know, and you know, it's not very very far away,  
No  
It's just a cul de sac  
Donn, donn, donn  
You're not very far away, no oh  
It's not, it's not very far away  
It's not as far as a country mile  
(You got it)  
It's just a cul de sac

And I'm caught one more time  
Up on Cyprus Avenue  
And I'm caught one more time  
Up on Cyprus Avenue  
And I'm conquered in a car seat  
Not a thing that I can do  
I may go crazy  
Before that mansion on the hill  
I may go crazy  
Before that mansion on the hill  
But my heart keeps beating faster  
And my feet can't keep still  
And all the little girls rhyme something  
On the way back home from school  
And all the little girls rhyme something  
On the way back home from school  
And the leaves fall one by one by one by one  
Call the autumn time a fool  
Yeah baby my tongue gets tied  
Every every every time I try to speak  
My tongue gets tied  
Every time I try to speak  
And my inside shakes just like a leaf on a tree  
I think I'll go on by the river with my cherry cherry wine  
I believe I'll go walking by the railroad with my cherry cherry wine  
If I pass the rumbling station where the lonesome engine drivers pine  
And wait a minute, yonder comes my lady  
Rainbow ribbons in her hair  
Yonder comes my lady  
Rainbow ribbons in her hair  
Six white horses and a carriage  
She's returning from the fair  
Baby, baby, baby  
And if I'm caught one more time  
Up on Cyprus Avenue  
And if I'm caught one more time  
Up on Cyprus Avenue  
And I'm conquered in a car seat  
And I'm looking straight at you  
Way up on, way up on, way up on....  
The avenue of trees  
Keep walking down  
In the wind and the rain, darling  
You keep walking down when the sun shone through the trees  
Nobody, no, no, no, nobody stops me from loving you baby  
So young and bold, fourteen years old  
Baby, baby, baby...  
Ooooh-ee

Baby in the daring night  
Squeeze me don't leave me

I want to know did you get the feelin'?  
Did you get it down in your soul?  
I want to know did you get the feelin'?  
And did the feelin' grow?  
  
Sometimes, when the spirit moves me  
I can do many wondrous things  
I want to know when the spirit moves you  
Did ye get healed?  
  
I begin to realize  
It manifest in my life  
In oh, so many ways  
Every day I want to talk about it  
And walk about it  
Everyday I want to be closer  
  
I want to know did you get the feelin'?  
Did you get it down in your soul?  
I want to know did you get the feelin'?  
Did ye get healed?  
  
I begin to realize  
Magic in my life  
See it manifest in oh, so many ways  
Every day is gettin' better and better  
I want to be daily walking close  
  
It gets stronger when you get the feelin'  
When you get it down in your soul  
And it makes you feel good  
And it makes you feel whole  
  
When the spirit moves you  
And it fills you through and through  
Every morning and at the break of day  
Did ye get healed?

Don't want to discuss it  
I think it's time for a change  
You may get disgusted  
And think I'm strange  
  
In that case I'll go underground  
Get some heavy rest  
Never have to worry  
About what is worst and what is best  
  
Oh oh Domino  
Roll me over Romeo  
There you go  
Lord have mercy  
  
I said oh oh Domino  
Roll me over Romeo  
There you go  
Say it again  
  
I said oh oh Domino  
I said oh oh Domino, dig it  
  
There's no need for argument  
There's no argument at all  
And if you never hear from him  
That just means he didn't call or vice versa  
That depends on wherever you're at  
And if you never hear from me  
That just means I would rather not  
  
I said oh oh Domino  
Roll me over Romeo  
There you go  
Lord have mercy  
I said oh oh Domino  
Roll me over Romeo  
  
There you go  
Say it again  
Oh oh Domino  
I said oh oh Domino.  
  
Hey Mr DJ  
I just want to hear some rhythm and blues music  
On the radio  
On the radio  
On the radio  
  
One more time

Don't get around much anymore  
The smoke has driven me out the door  
All night I used to walk the floor  
Don't go to nightclubs anymore  
  
Don't see my old friend Mose  
I don't run into Mr. Clive  
I cut out all that off the wall jive  
I don't go to nightclubs no more  
  
I'm not a legend in my own mind  
Don't need juice to unwind  
And don't have no need to pretend  
Ain't got no huckleberry friend  
  
Alcohol was too big a price  
Listen I just said no dice  
When it comes to the men and the mice  
Don't go to nightclubs anymore  
  
I'm not a legend in my own mind  
Don't need booze to unwind  
Don't have no reason to pretend  
Ain't got no huckleberry friend  
  
Alcohol was too big a price  
That why I said hey no dice  
When it comes to men or mice  
Don't go to nightclubs no more  
  
Don't go to nightclubs no more  
Don't go to nightclubs no more  
Don't go to nightclubs no more, I'm such a bore  
Don't go to nightclubs no more

Don't look back to the days of yesteryear,  
You cannot live on in the past,  
Don't look back.  
  
And I've known so many people  
That still try to live on in the past,  
Don't look back, oh no.  
  
And if I could call back all those days of yesteryear,  
I would never grow old and I'd never be poor,  
But darlin', those days are gone, oh yeah.  
  
Stop dreaming  
And live on in the future,  
But darlin', don't look back, oh no,  
Don't look back, oh

If this life is driving you to drink  
Sitting round what's the use what to think  
Well I've got some consolation  
Give it to you if I might  
You know I don't worry about a thing because  
Nothing's gonna turn out right  
  
Well this world's just one big troubled spot  
Some have plenty, some have not  
I've used to be troubled but  
I finally saw the light  
Now I don't worry about a thing because I know  
Nothing's gonna be alright  
  
You spend your time trying to be the big winner  
The minute you'll get fat somebody else will get thinner  
There's always somebody messing with dynamite  
You know I don't worry about a thing because I know  
Nothing's gonna turn out right

Don't worry about tomorrow  
That ain't gonna help you none  
Don't worry about tomorrow  
That ain't gonna help you none  
You've gotta live and take each day as it comes  
  
It may not be exactly what you're looking for  
It may not be exactly what you're looking for  
But what you're looking for ain't gonna come walking  
Through your front hall door, oh no  
  
So, don't worry about tomorrow  
Gotta live each day as it comes  
Don't worry about tomorrow  
You gotta live each day as it comes  
It's the only way you seem to get things done

Don't ya know, don't ya know  
That it hurts to be treated like a fool?  
A don't ya know, don't ya know  
That it's mean, and it's oh-so cruel?  
  
When you said you were home  
It was just a lie  
You were seen on the town  
With another guy  
Gonna break my heart in two  
Oh, baby, don't ya know?  
  
A don't ya know, don't ya know  
That your cheatin's breakin' us apart?  
A don't ya know, don't ya know  
That you'll tear my soul apart?  
Why must you go foolin' 'round every other boy  
And just push me away like a broken toy  
Baby, feel so bad inside  
Oh baby, don't ya know?  
  
Oh, don't ya know, don't ya know  
It's a foolish thing that you do?  
A don't ya know, don't ya know  
Fate could easily turn on you?  
'Cause they say it's a game more than one can play  
And you might be the one to get hurt someday  
It could be your turn to cry  
Oh baby, don't ya know?  
  
Oh, don't ya know oh, oh, baby?  
Don't ya know?  
You're gonna get hurt some day  
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh don't you feel my leg, don't you feel my leg  
'Cause if you feel my leg, you'll want to feel my thigh  
Don't you feel my thigh, you'll wanna move up high  
So don't you feel my leg  
  
Don't you buy no rye, don't you buy no rye  
'Cause if you buy me some rye, you gonna make me high  
If you make me high, you'll wanna loosen my tie  
Don't you buy no rye  
  
Now you say you'll take me out, buy me gin and wine  
You got something different on your mind  
Say we're gonna have a lovely time  
But what I got I know is mine  
  
Don't you feel my leg, don't you feel my leg  
'Cause if you feel my leg, you'll want to feel my thigh  
If you feel my thigh, you're gonna get a surprise  
Don't you feel my leg  
  
Now you say you'll take me out buy me gin and wine  
Honey, you got something on your mind  
Say we're gonna have a lovely time  
What I got I know is mine  
  
Don't you feel my leg, don't you feel my leg  
'Cause if you feel my leg, you'll wanna feel my thigh  
If you feel my thigh, you'll want to move up high  
You're gonna get a surprise  
So, don't you feel my leg  
So, don't you feel my leg  
So, don't you feel my leg

Well it's down the road I go  
And I got those worried  
Lonesome homesick Jones  
Way on down the road  
  
Well it's down the road I go  
Well I got the blues  
From way down in New Orleans  
Way on down the road  
  
And I got to be so far away  
Oh don't you see  
All our memories, dreams and reflections  
That keep haunting me  
  
Well it's down the road I go  
And I hear those gypsy voices  
Calling me  
Way on down the road  
  
Well I got to be  
So far away in my memory  
Dreams and reflections come on  
Keep on back haunting me  
  
Well it's down the road I go  
Well I got the blues  
From down in New Orleans  
Way on down the road  
  
Well it's down the road I go  
Well I ve got the worried  
Lonesome homesick Jones  
Way on down the road  
  
Way on down the road  
Oh down the road  
Way on down the road baby come on  
Way on down the road  
Trying to find my way back home  
Trying to find my way back home  
  
Further on down the road  
Trying to find my way back home  
Further on down the road  
Down the road of peace  
Down the road of peace  
Down the road of peace baby

Lord have mercy! Feel so good  
I think I'm gonna work  
  
I was talking to the judge, just before we left the countryside  
Piece of paper in his hand, tryin' to find the way  
Tryin' to rip it out, well now I've got it all around  
Tore the pages up before they brought the curtain down  
  
I remember the day, the "Drumshanbo Hustle"  
When you couldn't hear a bird, it was making not a sound  
They were trying to muscle in, an easy way to bring the money in  
You were puking up your guts  
When you looked at the standard contract you just signed  
  
Prostitution on the run, 'cepting when it was soliciting  
Tryin' to drain them all dry, got hung up by the rope  
Magazines and books, clearly undefinable  
Wiped the clean slate, and pulled the rug from underneath her feet  
  
I remember the day, the "Drumshanbo Hustle"  
When you couldn't hear no birds, 'cause they were making not a sound  
They were trying to muscle in, the recording and the publishing  
You were puking up your guts  
When you read the standard contract you just signed, alright!  
  
New York hooker by the neck, reads your Tarot cards and astronomy  
Hey, I want to get your stars but don't know your sign  
It was taking time to get the message through to it  
But will hand down shake you one, and a letter five "T" rhyme  
No sign poker  
  
Oh, remember the day, the 'Drumshanbo Hustle'  
Couldn't hear a bird, Lord, you couldn't hear no sound  
They were trying to muscle in  
On the gigs and the recording and the publishing  
You were puking up your guts  
When you read the standard contract you just signed  
You were puking up your guts  
When you read the standard contract that you signed  
You were puking up your guts  
When you read the standard contract you just signed

I'm a dweller on the threshold  
And I'm waiting at the door  
And I'm standing in the darkness  
I don't want to wait no more  
  
I have seen without perceiving  
I have been another man  
Let me pierce the realm of glamor  
So I know just what I am  
  
I'm a dweller on the threshold  
And I'm waiting at the door  
And I'm standing in the darkness  
I don't want to wait no more  
  
Feel the angel of the present  
In the mighty crystal fire  
Lift me up consume my darkness  
Let me travel even higher  
  
I'm a dweller on the threshold  
As I cross the burning ground  
Let me go down to the water  
Watch the great illusion drown  
  
I'm a dweller on the threshold  
And I'm waiting at the door  
And I'm standing in the darkness  
I don't want to wait no more  
  
I'm gonna turn and face the music  
The music of the spheres  
Lift me up consume my darkness  
When the midnight disappears  
  
I will walk out of the darkness  
And I'll walk into the light  
And I'll sing the song of ages  
And the dawn will end the night  
  
I'm a dweller on the threshold  
And I'm waiting at the door  
And I'm standing in the darkness  
I don't want to wait no more  
  
I'm a dweller on the threshold  
And I cross some burning ground  
And I'll go down to the water  
Let the great illusion drown  
  
I'm a dweller on the threshold  
And I'm waiting at the door  
And I'm standing in the darkness  
I don't want to wait no more  
  
I'm a dweller on the threshold  
Dweller on the threshold  
I'm a dweller on the threshold  
I'm a dweller on the threshold

You're a slave to the capitalist system  
Which is ruled by the global elite  
What happened to, the individual  
What happened to, the working class white  
  
They filled his head with so much propaganda  
Entertainment on tv and all kinds of shite  
What happened to the individual  
When he gave up all of his rights  
  
Tell you up is down and wrong is right  
Nothing to hang your hat on, can't even get uptight  
  
You're controlled by the media  
Everything you say and do  
What happened to, the individual  
Tell me what happened to you  
Tell you up is down, not able to fight  
Keep you docile and complacent, can't even get uptight  
Controlled by the media and you don't know what you can do  
They took away your constitution you don't even know what happened to you  
  
Waffle is the language that they taught you, taught you to talk  
But you can't even get any angle 'cause you forgot how. keep on walking the
walk  
  
You're a slave to the capitalist system and it's controlled by the global
elite  
Double dealing with the banks, behind your back, just can't fight

When too many demands have destroyed all my plans  
Going down to end of the land  
If I have to drive all night just to feel all right  
Going down to the end of the land  
  
When it gets out of hand and I fail to agree  
Just what's in it for me?  
Going down to the sea  
  
Then I've got to run towards the setting sun  
Going down to the end of the land  
  
When it gets out of hand and I beg to disagree  
Just what's in it for me?  
Get back down to the sea  
  
And then I've got to run to the setting sun  
Going down to the end of the land  
If I've got to drive all night till the morning light  
I'm going down to the end of the land  
  
Ba da da da da, ba da da da da da  
Going down, going down, going down to the end of the land  
Ba da da da da, ba da da da da  
Going down to the end of the land

No pot of gold at the end of the rainbow  
No social ladder to climb around here  
No panhandlers going to stake any claim here  
Goldmine is not what it's worth, know the score  
  
No carpetbaggers, come in and take it  
That just doesn't exist anymore  
Rugs and the furniture just can't be lifted  
Everything now has got to be nailed to the floor  
  
So much for capitalism, so much for materialism  
Every penny now has got to be earned  
Everyone has got to be here at the coalface  
Taking coals to Newcastle, you're going to get burned  
  
No gravy train that stops at your station  
Every penny has got to be earned  
Everyone now has got to be at the coalface  
Try taking coals to Newcastle, you're going to get burned  
  
No pot of gold at the end of the rainbow  
No social ladder to climb anymore  
No panhandler can stake a claim here  
Goldmine is not what it's worth, know the score  
  
No carpetbaggers, come in and take it  
It's not there for the taking no more  
Rugs and the furniture cannot be lifted  
Everything has got to be nailed to the floor  
  
No pot of gold, end of the rainbow  
No pot of gold, end of the rainbow no more  
End of the rainbow no more  
No pot of gold at the end of the rainbow  
No social ladder to climb anymore  
No pot of gold, end of the rainbow  
No social ladder to climb  
Know the score  
Know the score

Chop that wood  
Carry water  
What's the sound of one hand clapping  
Enlightenment, don't know what it is  
  
Every second, every minute  
It keeps changing to something different  
Enlightenment, don't know what it is  
Enlightenment, don't know what it is  
It says it's non attachment  
Non attachment. Non attachment  
  
I'm in the here and now, and I'm meditating  
And still I'm suffering but that's my problem  
Enlightenment, don't know what it is  
  
Wake up  
  
Enlightenment says the world is nothing  
Nothing but a dream, everything's an illusion  
And nothing is real  
  
Good or bad, baby  
You can change it anyway you want  
You can rearrange it  
Enlightenment, don't know what it is  
Chop that wood and carry water  
What's the sound of one hand clapping  
Enlightenment, don't you know what it is  
  
All around baby, you can see  
You're making your own reality everyday because  
Enlightenment, don't know what it is  
  
One more time  
  
Enlightenment. Don't you know what it is  
It's up to you  
Enlightenment. Don't know what it is  
It's up to you, everyday  
Enlightenment, don't know what it is  
It's always up to you  
Enlightenment, don't know what it is  
It's up to you, the way you think

By the light of the moon  
When the night holds the secrets  
Of the sleepy lagoon  
I'm contemplating moonlight  
On the water  
When I'm walking with you  
On an evening in June  
  
On an evening in June  
It can get so sentimental  
When I'm thinking of you  
And I can't think of anything  
Except being with you  
When the summer is through  
On an evening in June  
  
On an evening in June  
Well it lifts me up  
When I'm talking to you  
On an evening in June  
When the flowers are in bloom  
And the sky is so blue  
  
Well there's so many things  
Taking place  
That it's hard to keep up with it all  
Keep your eye on the ball  
And to make the right call  
When we're longing for fall  
On this evening in June  
  
On an evening in June  
Well it lifts me up  
When I'm talking to you  
On an evening in June  
When the flowers are in bloom  
And the sky is so blue  
  
Well there's so many things taking place  
That it's hard to keep up with it all  
Keep your eye on the ball  
And to make the right call  
When we're longing for fall  
On this evening in June  
By the sleepy lagoon  
On an evening in June  
By the light of the moon  
By the sleepy lagoon  
On an evening in June  
On an evening in June  
By the sleepy lagoon  
By the light of the moon  
By the sleepy lagoon  
On an evening in June

Love to hear that evening train go by  
Love to hear that evening train go by  
'Specially when my baby's in my mind  
  
Love to hear that lonesome whistle blow  
Love to hear that lonesome whistle blow  
When I make my way on down the road  
  
My my  
Bye bye  
Don't cry  
Don't sigh  
When you hear that evening train go by  
  
Love to hear that evening train on time  
Love to hear that evening train on time  
'Specially when those worries are on my mind  
  
My my  
Don't cry  
Why why  
Don't sigh  
When you hear that evening train go by  
  
Love to see those fields I used to roam  
Love to see those fields I used to roam  
Then I know I'm on my way back home  
  
My my  
Goodbye  
Don't cry  
Don't sigh  
When you hear that evening train go by  
  
When you hear that evening train go by

We shall walk again down along the lane  
Down the avenue just like we used to do  
With our heads so high smile at the passers by  
Then we'll softly sigh ay, ay, ay, ay, ay  
  
[Chorus:]  
Everyone, everyone, everyone, everyone  
Everyone, everyone, everyone, everyone  
  
By the winding stream we shall lie and dream  
We'll make dreams come true if we want them to  
Yes all will come play the pipes and drum  
Sing a happy song and we'll sing along  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We shall walk again down along the lane  
Down the avenue just like we used to do  
With our heads so high smile at the passers by  
Then we'll softly sigh ay, ay, ay, ay, ay

Fair play to you  
Killarney's lakes are so blue  
And the architecture I'm taking in with my mind  
So fine  
  
Tell me of Poe  
Oscar Wilde and Thoreau  
Let your midnight and your daytime turn into love of life  
It's a very fine line  
But you've got the mind child  
To carry on  
When it's just about to be  
Carried on  
  
And there's only one meadow's way to go  
And you say "Geronimo"  
There's only one meadow's way to go  
And you say "Geronimo"  
  
A paperback book  
As we walk down the street  
Fill my mind with tales of mystery, mystery  
And imagination  
  
Forever fair  
And I'm touching your hair  
I wish we could be dreamers  
In this dream, oh  
Let it dream  
  
And there's only one meadow's way to go  
And you say "Geronimo"  
And there's only one meadow's way to go  
And you say "Geronimo"  
  
Fair play to you  
Killarney's lakes are so blue  
High-ho silver, tit for tat  
And I love you for that  
High-ho silver, tit for tat  
And I love you for that, love you for that, love you for that  
High-ho silver, tit for tat, tit for tat  
And I love you for that  
High-ho silver, tit for tat, hah!  
Yeah, yeah  
And I love you for that  
  
And there's only one meadow's way to go  
And I, and I say "Geronimo"  
And there's only one meadow's way to go  
And we say "Geronimo"  
Geronimo  
And there's only one meadow's way to go  
And we say Geronimo  
And there's only one meadow's way to go  
And we say Geronimo  
  
Fair play to you

Well you've been on a fast train and it's going off the rails  
And you can't come back can't come back together again  
And you start breaking down  
In the pouring rain  
Well you've been on a fast train  
  
When your lover has gone away don't it make you feet so sad  
And you go on a journey way into the land  
And you start breaking down  
Cause you're under the strain  
And you jump on a fast train  
  
You had to go on the lam you stepped into no-man's land  
Ain't nobody here on your waveband  
Ain't nobody gonna give you a helping hand  
And you start breaking down  
And just go into the sound  
When you hear that fast train  
  
And you keep moving on to the sound of the wheels  
And deep inside your heart you really know oh, just how it feels  
And you start breaking down and go into the pain  
Keep on moving on a fast train  
  
You're way over the line next thing you're out of your mind  
And you're out of your depth in through the window she crept  
Oh there's nowhere to go in the sleet and the snow  
Just keep on moving on a fast train  
  
You had to go on the lam stepping in no-man's land  
Ain't nobody here on your waveband  
Nobody even gonna lend you a helping hand  
Oh and you're so alone can you really make it on your own  
Keep on moving on a fast train  
  
Oh going nowhere, except on a fast train  
Oh trying to get away from the past  
Oh keep on moving keep on moving on a fast train  
Going nowhere, across the desert sand, through the barren waste  
On a fast train going nowhere  
On a fast train going nowhere

I'm standing by my window  
And I'm waiting on the summer rain  
And I'm standing by my window  
And I'm waiting on the summer rain  
Well, I felt this way before and  
I'm gonna feel this way again  
  
I've been listening to this music  
Ever since the age of three  
I've been listening to this music  
Ever since the age of three  
I want you to play me a "T" for Texas  
Or play me a "T" for Tennessee  
  
I want a plain glass of water  
Vanilla ice cream with a cherry on top, that's what I want  
I want a plain glass of water  
Uh, huh, vanilla ice cream with a cherry on top, mm, hm, hm, hm,  
Take a walk with me, baby  
Up the foggy mountain top, watch it!  
  
I'm going up on highway one  
Said you know I dig it the most  
I'm going up on highway one  
Eh, you know I dig it the most  
I'm gonna sing this song  
All along the water coast  
  
I want a plain glass of water  
Ice cream with a cherry on top, that's the way I like it, ah!  
I want a plain glass of water,  
Vanilla ice cream with a cherry on top  
Walk with me, baby  
Up the foggy mountain top, what's that?  
Oh, come along with me, oh!  
On the foggy mountain top  
Keep on walking, keep on walking, baby  
On the foggy mountain top  
Keep walking with me baby  
Up the foggy mountain top

From faded newsprint used to wrap a fish  
Inscrutably the muse selects your face  
As I sit drinking famously in an Irish bar  
Five thousand miles and thirty years away  
  
With the usual ceremonial you were crowned one night  
King of the field where doctors nail the cows  
To make of the cock's quill the rights of language  
And the pricking heart a sword against the hours  
  
Let smirking scholars writhe in their favorite bondage  
And hold you plaintiff to the charge of art  
Exhibit A: he falls on legendary lines  
Singing mother I don't want a pain here in my heart  
  
The judge in me sucks eggs and jerks the sacred meat  
But the boy in me still dreams in Milk Wood town  
Like two provincial bastards playing the galleries  
I hold your photo to a mirror upside down  
  
And as bacon wafts through hungry streets, your ghost pervades  
Just like an old ex-boxer aged twenty two  
Staged-up like Falstaff or the wild welsh Rimbaud  
You'd laugh to see the monograms they make of you  
Ah, Mr. Thomas let us ramble through the midnight fair  
Let us throw old bottles at the Ferris wheel  
Let us paint library on the library let us raid the moonlight  
Let us steal whatever we are supposed to steal  
  
Let us watch while the days grow daily more mundane  
That rough God go riding with his shears  
Hack wide the belly of the swollen mountains  
And rip molten heroes forth from their furious tears  
  
Oh, Mr. Thomas, oh, Mr. Thomas,  
Let us steal whatever we're supposed to steal  
Mr. Thomas, oh, Mr. Thomas,  
Why don't we feel whatever we're supposed to feel  
  
Oh, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Thomas,  
Why don't we feel whatever we're supposed to feel  
Oh, Mr. Thomas let us ramble through the midnight  
Let us throw bottles at the Ferris wheel  
Let us paint library on the library let us raid the moonlight  
Let us steal whatever we're supposed to steal

I saw you from a foreign window  
Bearing down the sufferin' road  
You were carryin' your burden  
To the palace of the Lord  
To the palace of the Lord  
  
I spied you from a foreign window  
When the lilacs were in bloom  
  
And the sun shone through your window pane  
To the place you kept your books  
You were reading on your sofa  
You were singin' every prayer  
That the masters had instilled in you  
Since Lord Byron loved despair  
In the palace of the Lord  
In the palace of the Lord  
  
And if you get it right this time  
You don't have to come back again  
And if you get it right this time  
There's no need to explain  
  
I saw you from a foreign  
Bearing down the sufferin' road  
You were carryin' your burden  
You were singing about Rimbaud  
I was going down to Geneva  
When the Kingdom had been found  
I was giving you protection  
From the loneliness of the crowd  
In the palace of the Lord  
In the palace of the Lord  
  
They were giving you religion  
Breaking bread and drinking wine  
And you laid out on the green hills  
Just like when you were a child  
I saw you from a foreign window  
You were trying to find your way back home  
You were carrying your defects  
Sleeping on a pallet on the floor  
In the palace of the Lord  
In the palace of the Lord  
In the palace of the Lord

[L.D.]  
We'll take it a bit slower  
This is, this is the, huh, this is the first song I ever learned, actually  
Frankie and Johnny were sweethearts  
Lordy, how they could love  
  
Swore to be true to each other  
Yeah, true to the skies above  
He was her man, wouldn't do her no wrong  
And Frankie and Johnny went walkin'  
  
And Johnny had on a new suit  
Yeah, Frankie spent one-hundred dollar notes  
Just to make her man look cute  
He was her man, he wouldn't do her no wrong  
  
Frankie went over to the barroom  
Stopped for a bottle of beer  
Said to the old bartender man  
Has my lover Johnny man been here?  
  
He was my man, Lord, but he'd been doin' me wrong, so wrong.  
Yeah Frankie looked over the transom door  
And then to her great surprise  
There sat her lover man Johnny  
  
Makin' love to Nellie Bly  
He was her man, but he was doin' her wrong  
Well Frankie lifted up her kimono dress  
And she drew (ladaladalala) out a little .44  
  
She shot once, twice, three times (three times) she shot him  
And through that hardwood (door) floor  
Yeah she shot her man (yeah he was her man)  
Well but he been doin' her wrong yeah  
  
He said, roll me over so careful ah  
Roll me over so slow,  
Oh roll me on to my left hand side,  
Because your bullet hurt me so,  
  
I was your man, but I been doin' you wrong.  
Play it Chris!  
  
Well they sent for Frankie's mother  
Come down to Huddy's saloon  
To see what's the matter with her boy  
She come down, Frankie looked up at her  
  
Here what she said:  
She said, Oh Mrs. Johnson, oh forgive me please  
Well I killed your lovin' son, Johnny  
But I'm down on my bended knee  
  
I shot your man, 'cause he was doin' me wrong. ah  
She said, I'll forgive you Frankie,  
She said, I'll forgive you not, not  
For killin' my lovin' son Johnny,  
  
He's the only support that I've got,  
'Cause you shot my man and he was doin' you wrong.  
Well the last time I seen Frankie  
She was a-sittin' in a dungeon cell  
  
She would be there moanin', herself  
With no one there to care  
She shot her man, a he'd been doin' her wrong, so wrong  
Well bring out the overtime hearse all day long  
  
You gotta bring out the pony and truck hey  
They're gonna take Johnny, Johnny to the cemetery (graveyard)  
And they ain't never coming back  
Oh he was her man, oh but he been doin' her wrong, so wrong  
  
Well the story ain't got no moral, Lordy  
But the story ain't got no end  
Well the story only goes to show  
That there ain't no damn good in men  
  
He was her man, but he was doin' her wrong  
Yeah, ba-da-ba-ba-da-ba-ba-da-ba-ba-ba-ba

From the North  
To the South,  
Ya' walked all the way.  
Ya' know ya' left your,  
Left your home  
For good to stay,  
While ya' built all,  
All of your castles  
In the sun,  
And I watched ya' knock 'em down,  
Knock 'em down, each and every one.  
Whoa-oh, Friday's child  
Ya' can't stop now.  
No.  
Whoa-oh, Friday's child  
Ya' can't stop now.  
  
And I watched you  
'Fore you 'came too ol' (??)  
And I tol' ya'  
A long time before ya' ever came to be told,  
"You've got somethin'  
That they all want to know.  
You gotta hold on  
And never ever let go."  
Whoa-oh, Friday's child  
Ya' can't stop now.  
No, no.  
Whoa-oh, Friday's child  
Ya' cannot stop now,  
Ya' can't stop.  
  
There ya' go,  
There ya' go, rainbows hangin' around your feet,  
And you're makin' out,  
You're makin' out with everyone that you meet.  
Even havin' a ball  
And stayin' up late,  
And watched the sun come up  
'round Nottinghill Gate.  
Whoa-oh, Friday's child  
Ya' can't stop now.  
No, no.  
Whoa-oh, Friday's child  
Ya' cannot stop.  
You're drivin'.  
Aaowwh,  
No no no no no no no no no,  
Ya' cannot stop now.  
You're too much.  
Ya' can't stop, ya' can't stop, ya' can't stop, can't stop, no.

Like a full force gale  
I was lifted up again  
I was lifted up again by the Lord  
  
And no matter where I roam  
I will find my way back home  
I will always return to the Lord  
  
In the gentle evening breeze  
By the whispering shady trees  
I will find my sanctuary in the Lord  
  
I was headed for a fall  
The I looked up and saw the writing on the wall  
  
Like a full force gale  
I was lifted up again  
I was lifted up again by the Lord  
  
I was headed for a fall  
The I looked up and saw the writing on the wall  
  
In the gentle evening breeze  
By the whispering shady trees  
I will find my sanctuary in the Lord  
  
And no matter where I roam  
I will find my way back home  
I will always return to the Lord  
  
Like a full force gale  
I was lifted up again  
I was lifted up again by the Lord

Georgia, Georgia,

Keeps Georgia on my mind  
Oh, on my mind, on my mind  
  
Well, well, well, well, well I say hey now, hey now, hey now, hey now

Other arms reach out to me  
Other eyes smile tenderly  
For that peaceful dreams I see  
The road, the road, the road, the road, the road, the road, the road, the

Leads back to you

Just an old sweet song  
Keeps you, keeps you, keeps you  
Gentle on my mind

On my mind, on my mind.

I just can't seem to take much more of this  
Got too much hassle baby and not enough bliss  
Got to give these hangers on a miss  
'cause I need some help I just don't get  
  
No one seems to understand what's up  
What's up, what's up  
So called friends come and go  
And things just don't add up  
Trying to make my way  
Through all this illusion and myth  
I don't even have no safety net  
  
Nero fiddled while Rome burnt  
Napoleon met his Waterloo  
Sampson went spare when Delilah cut his hair  
But little David slew Goliath too  
  
I'm just trying to get some results  
Listen baby I'm not trying to start my own cult  
Please tell me something that I don't know  
I just want to get on with the show  
  
Nero fiddled while Rome burnt  
Napoleon met his Waterloo  
Sampson went spare when Delilah cut his hair  
But little David slew Goliath too  
  
You'd think some program might do the trick  
Let me tell you this wall of fog  
Is just too thick  
I thought of everything but the whip  
But baby nobody on my ship is up to it  
  
I'm just trying to get some results, some results  
I'm not trying to start my own cult, no ..  
Just tell me something that I don't know  
I just want to get on with the show  
  
I just want to get on with the show  
Just tell me something that I don't know  
I just want to get on with the show  
And if it don't work then let it go

Honey from your sweet lips

Baby just one of your smiles  
You know makes it all worthwhile  
Baby just one of your smiles

Together hand in hand  
But if you think  
That it's gonna rain  
We'll stay at home  
And listen to the band  
  
Baby just one sweet kiss  
Honey from your sweet lips

There are strange things happening every day  
I hear music up above my head  
Fill me up with your wonder  
Give me my rapture today.  
  
Let me contemplate the presence so divine  
Let me sing all day and never get tired  
Fill me up from your loving cup  
Give me my rapture.  
  
Won't you guide me through the dark night of the soul  
That I may better understand your way  
Let me be just and worthy to receive  
All the blessings of the Lord into my life.  
  
Let me purify my thoughts and words and deeds  
That I may be a vehicle for thee  
Let me hold to the truth in the darkest hour  
Le me sing to the glory of the Lord.  
Give me my rapture today.  
  
Let me purify my thoughts and words and deeds  
That I may be a vehicle for thee  
Let me hold to the truth in the darkest hour  
Le me sing to the glory of the Lord.  
Give me my rapture today.

And they'll lay you down low in the easy  
And the lips that you kiss will say Christmas.  
And the miles that you traveled the distance  
  
So believe no lies, dry your eyes and realize  
That surprise  
La, la, la, la la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la...  
And the businessmen will shake hands and talk in numbers  
And the princess will wake up from her slumber  
Then all the knights will step forth with their arm bands  
And ev'ry stranger you meet in the street will make demands  
So believe no lies, then dry your eyes and realize  
That surprise  
La, la, la...  
  
[Bridge:]  
And we'll send you glad tidings from New York  
Open up your eyes so you may see  
Ask you not to read between the lines  
Hope that you will come in right on time  
And they'll talk to you while you're in trances  
And you'll visualize not taking any chances  
But meet them halfway with love, peace and persuasion  
And expect them to rise for the occasion  
Don't it gratify when you see it materialize  
Right in front of your eyes  
That surprise  
  
And they'll lay you down low and easy

I think you should go for yourself this time.

Oh, baby, baby.  
Baby, I want to get a job down funky Broadway.  
Go for yourself.  
Go for yourself.  
Go for yourself.

Goin' down Geneva, give me a helping hand  
I'm goin' down Geneva, give me a helping hand  
It's not easy baby, living on the exile plan  
  
Down on the bottom, down to my new pair of shoes  
Down on the bottom, down to my new pair of shoes  
I'm down by the lakeside, thinking 'bout my baby blue  
  
Last night I played a gig in Salzburg, outside in the pouring rain  
Last night I played a gig in Salzburg, outside in the pouring rain  
Flew from there to Montreux and my heart was filled with pain  
  
Look out my window, back at the way things are  
Look out my window pane, back at the way things are  
Just wonder how, how did things ever get this far  
  
Vince Taylor used to live here, nobody's ever heard of him  
Vince Taylor used to live here, but nobody's heard of him, ain't that a shame  
Just who he was, just where he fits in  
  
He was goin' down Geneva. give him helping hand  
He was goin' down Geneva, give him helping hand  
It wasn't easy living on the exile plan  
  
Vince Taylor used to live here, nobody's even heard of him  
Vince, Vince Taylor lives here, nobody's even heard of him  
Just who he was, just where he fits in  
  
Just who he was, just where he fits in

Well I heard the bells ringing, I was thinking about winning  
In this God forsaken place  
When my confidence was well, then I tripped and I felt  
Right flat on my face  
Now I'm standing erect, and I feel like coming back  
And the sun is shining gold  
Put a smile on my face, get back in the human race  
And get on with the show  
  
And I'm taking in the Indian Summer  
And I'm soaking it up in my mind  
And I'm pretending that it's paradise  
On a golden autumn day, on a golden autumn day  
On a golden autumn day, an a golden autumn day  
  
In the wee midnight hour I was parking my car  
In this dimly lit town,  
I was attacked by two thugs, who took me for a mug  
And shoved me down on the ground  
And they pulled out a knife, and I fought my way up  
As they scarpered from the scene  
Well this is no New York street, and there's no Bobby on the beat  
And things ain't just what they seem  
  
And I'm taking in the Indian Summer  
And I'm soaking it up in my mind  
And I'm pretending that it's paradise  
On a golden autumn day, on a golden autumn day  
On a golden autumn day, an a golden autumn day  
  
Who would think this could happen in a city like this  
Among Blake's green and pleasant hills,  
And we must remember as we go through September  
Among these dark satanic mills  
If there's such a thing as justice I could take them out and flog them  
In the nearest green field  
And it might be a lesson to the bleeders of the system  
In this whole society  
  
And I'm taking in the Indian Summer  
And I'm soaking it up in my mind  
And I'm pretending like it's paradise  
On a golden autumn day, on a golden autumn day  
On a golden autumn day, on a golden autumn day, golden autumn day ...

[Chorus:]  
Good mornin' blues, blues how do ya do?  
Good mornin' blues, blues how do ya do?  
Well I'm doing alright this morning, how are you?  
  
I woke up this morning  
Couldn't get outta my bed

Couldn't get you outta my bed  
Went to eat my breakfast and  
The blues was all in my bread  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Well the blues ain't nothing but a poor working man feeling down  
Lord, the blues ain't nothing but a poor working man feeling down  
That's about the meagerest feeling I done ever had  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Sent for you yesterday, here you come walking today (hey)

Can I go home with you?  
Tell your mama and your daddy,  
That I'm a little schoolboy too

Good morning little schoolgirl,

Uh, uh, uh

To fly all over your town.  
And tell everybody baby,

Just cannot help myself  
You're so young and pretty,  
But you're lovin' somebody else  
  
A good morning little schoolgirl,  
Can I go home with you?  
Uh, uh, uh  
Oh babe what you do to me,  
I can't help myself

Last Saturday night I got married  
Me and my wife settled down  
But me and my wife have parted  
I'm gonna take another stroll downtown  
  
Irene goodnight (goodnight Irene)  
Irene goodnight  
Goodnight Irene, goodnight Irene  
I'll get you in my dream  
  
Stop your ramblin'  
Stop your gamblin'  
Stop stayin' out late, late at night  
Go home to your wife and your family  
Sit down by your fireside so bright  
  
Irene goodnight (Irene)  
Irene goodnight  
Goodnight Irene, goodnight Irene

Love 'er, love 'er, love 'er, love 'er, love 'er  
Love 'er, love 'er, love 'er, love 'er  
Still the sea runs dry  
And if Irene ever turns her back on me  
I'm gonna take morphine and die  
  
Irene goodnight  
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight  
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight  
Irene goodnight  
Goodnight Irene, goodnight Irene  
I'll get you in my dream

When I was a young boy  
Back in Orangefield  
I used to gaze out  
My classroom window and dream  
And then go home and listen to Ray sing  
"I believe to my soul" after school,  
Oh that love that was within me  
You know it carried me through  
Well it lifted me up and it filled me  
Meditation contemplation too  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh we've got to go back  
Got to go back  
Got to go back  
Got to go back  
For the healing, go on with the dreaming  
  
Well there's people in the street  
And the summer's almost here  
We've got to go outside in the fresh air  
And breathe while it's still clear  
Breathe it in all the way down  
To your stomach too  
And breathe it out with a radiance  
Into the night time air  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Got my ticket at the airport  
Well I guess I've been marking time  
I've been living in another country  
That operates along entirely different lines  
Keep me away from porter or whiskey  
Don't play anything sentimental it'll make me cry  
I've got to go back my friend  
Is there really any need to ask why  
  
[Chorus]  
With the dreaming  
With the dreaming  
With the dreaming

Green mansions, high upon a hill  
Green mansions, quiet and still  
Big wall all around  
It's where my baby will be found  
Waiting for that day, to come  
  
Green mansions, high upon a hill  
In the countryside where the birds begin to sing  
Free from the glamor of the world  
Where the story does unfurl  
Waiting on that day to come  
  
Tried in vain to forget  
Just how it ought to be  
Over and over and over and over again  
'Bout what it means to me  
  
Green mansions, I can hear the mocking bird  
Birds singing in a melancholy wood  
The big wall all around  
Where my baby will be found  
Waiting for that day to come  
  
Well I've tried in vain, to forget  
Yeah what it ought to be  
Over and over, over again  
Just what it means to me  
  
Green mansions, high upon a hill  
Green mansions, quiet and still  
Big wall all around  
Where my baby will be found  
Waiting for that day to come  
  
Green mansions, high upon a hill  
Green mansions, quiet and still  
Big wall all around  
Where my baby will be found  
Waiting for that day to come.

You can make out pretty good  
When you're on your own  
And you know just where you are  
When you want to roam  
  
Got the moon above your head  
And the road beneath your feet  
Pull into a wooded glen  
Make your own retreat

Gypsy!  
  
Laying underneath the stars  
Can be so much fun  
Especially when you're feeling good  
When you're with the one you love  
  
Sway to sounds of two guitars  
Around the campfire bright  
Then mellow out like violins  
In the morning light

No matter where you wander  
And no matter where you roam  
Any place you hang your hat  
You know that that is home, check it out first  
  
Sway to sounds of two guitars  
Around the campfire bright  
Then mellow out like old violins  
In the morning light

It's just the gypsy in my soul  
Make me pack up my things and go  
It may seem like I'm on a roll  
But it's just the gypsy in my soul  
  
Layin' out in the midday sun  
Tryin' so hard not to run  
Looking out at the deep blue sea  
I guess it's just the gypsy in me  
  
Jump on that train, catch that plane  
Here and there and back again  
  
Well it seems like some kind of cruel fate  
Keep me moving in this restless state  
Sometimes it feels like I don't have any goal  
It's just the gypsy  
  
Catch that train, jump on that plane  
Here and there and back again  
  
Well it seems like some kind of cruel fate  
Keep me moving, moving in permanent restless state  
Seems like some days I don't have any goal  
It's just the gypsy in my soul  
  
Gypsy in my soul  
Gypsy in my soul

Dance on Gypsy Queen  
If it's all night, it's alright

If you let your love come tumblin' down  
It's alright  
  
Dance on (you know it's alright)  
Gypsy Queen  
Dance on (you know it's alright)

Laughin' at the summer moon  
Don't stop your carburetor  
Let your car run  
And if it starts to rain  
Keep on dancin' in the rain  
And if it's all night, it's alright  
  
Dance on (you know it's alright)

If you love me half as much as I love you  
You wouldn't worry me half as much as you do  
You're nice to me when there's no one else around  
You only build me up to let me down  
  
If you missed me half as much as I miss you  
You wouldn't stay away half as much as you do  
I know that I would never be this blue  
If you only loved me half as much as I love you  
  
If you love me half as much as I love you  
You wouldn't worry me half as much as you do  
You're nice to me when there's no one else around  
You only build me up to let me down  
  
If you missed me half as much as I miss you  
You wouldn't stay away half as much as you do  
I know that I would never be this blue  
If you only loved me half as much as I love you  
  
If you only loved me half as much as I love you  
One more time  
If you only loved me half as much as I love you

Hey kids dig the first takes  
Ain't that some inspiration  
When Sinatra sings against Nelson Riddle strings  
Then takes a vacation  
  
Seen some hard times  
Drawn some bad lines  
No time for shoeshines  
Hard nose the highway  
  
I was tore down at the dead's place  
Shaved head at the organ  
But that wasn't half as bad as it was oh no  
Belfast and Boston  
  
Put your money where your mouth is  
Then we can get something going  
In order to win you must be prepared to lose sometime  
And leave one or two cards showing

Beside the garden walls,  
We walk in haunts of ancient peace.  
At night we rest and go to sleep  
In haunts of ancient peace.  
The love and light we seek,  
The words we do not need to speak,  
Here in this wondrous way we keep  
These haunts of ancient peace.  
Let us go there again  
When we need some relief  
Oh, when I can't find my feet  
When I need rest and sleep.  
The Sunday bells they chime  
Around the countryside and towns  
A song of harmony and rhyme  
In haunts of ancient peace.  
The holy grail we seek  
On down by haunts of ancient peace.  
We see the new Jerusalem  
In haunts of ancient peace.  
Oh, when I can't find my feet  
Oh, when I need some relief  
One more time again.  
You know I want to go there one more time again.  
Be still in haunts of ancient peace.  
(Be still)

Have I told you lately that I love you  
Have I told you there's no one above you  
Fill my heart with gladness  
Take away my sadness  
Ease my troubles, that's what you do  
  
Oh the morning sun in all it's glory  
Greets the day with hope and comfort too  
And you fill my life with laughter  
You can make it better  
Ease my troubles that's what you do  
  
There's a love that's divine  
And it's yours and it's mine  
Like the sun  
At the end of the day  
We should give thanks and pray to the One  
  
Have I told you lately that I love you  
Have I told you there's no one above you  
Fill my heart with gladness  
Take away my sadness  
Ease my troubles, that's what you do

And it's yours and it's mine  
And it shines like the sun  
At the end of the day we will give thanks  
And pray to the One  
  
Have I told you lately that I love you  
Have I told you there's no one above you  
Fill my heart with gladness  
Take away my sadness  
Ease my troubles, that's what you do

Fill my life with gladness  
Ease my troubles that's what you do  
Fill my life with gladness  
Take away my sadness  
Ease my troubles that's what you do.

Little gal, little girl, Lord, you know it's true,  
Little gal, little girl, Lord, you know it's true,  
I don't want to stop rockin' and rollin' with you.  
  
Are you gonna let me stand alone ?  
Are you gonna let me stand alone ?  
Caught you this morning before your Daddy came home.  
  
And I done more for you than your Daddy has ever done,  
I done more for you than your Daddy has ever done,  
Gave you my jelly roll and he ain't give you none.  
Let's go, Eric.  
  
Don't you ever go down, down on Curzon Street, it's bad.  
Don't you ever go down, down on Curzon Street.  
That's where old John flogs his daily meat.  
  
Maybe sometime he say leave the little boy and the girl behind.  
I got messed up round somewhere called Notting Hill Gate,  
I lived there for a while, but I moved out and when I moved out I was in such
a state,  
I've never gone back there,  
  
But I, I'm sure I done more for you than your Daddy has ever done, baby,  
Made you learn your syllables.  
Done more for you than your Daddy has ever done, all right, ha ha,  
Gave you my jelly roll and he ain't give you none.  
Stay on the move.  
  
In the back street, in the back street I gave you my jelly roll,  
Ah, I gave it to you, ha ha.  
Remember when we were down in the, the alley  
And I said the lights were out, baby this is it you know, ha ha ha,  
All right, we got a good thing going.  
You can leave now if you don't like what's happening.  
You know we got a...a few things going, you know, ha ha,  
It's a drag, ha ha, huh, that's what you call it.

In the land of a thousand dances  
I dance with you  
I was out I was taking my chances  
When dreams came true  
When you came into my dream  
Like from a whisper to a scream  
  
And it's a real heavy connection  
It's just a real heavy connection  
It's a real heavy connection  
Lalalala  
  
I remember when I got your message in Amsterdam  
I was going through my letters  
And found a picture-postcard of the Reeperbahn  
When you came into the room  
Not too late and not too soon  
  
And it's a real heavy connection  
And it's a real heavy connection  
And it's a real heavy connection  
Lalalala  
  
And you came into my dreams  
From a whisper to a scream  
  
And it's a real heavy connection  
And it's a real heavy connection  
It's just a real heavy connection  
Lalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalala  
  
And it's a real heavy connection  
And it's a real heavy connection  
And it's a real heavy connection  
Lalalala  
Baby, baby, baby  
I can't stop this rainbow  
Touching my soul  
I can't stop this rainbow  
In my soul  
Baby, baby, baby  
Baby, baby, baby  
Baby, baby, baby  
Baby, baby, baby  
Baby, baby, baby

On the road with my sword  
And my shield in my hand  
Pressing on to the new day  
This love will surely last forever  
This love will surely last always  
  
In the valley I see horsemen pass  
Baby, baby, baby they don't want this love to last  
There's a battle for the throne  
And it's raging down in your soul  
It says this love will surely last forever  
This love will surely last always  
This love will surely last forever  
This love will surely last always  
  
I've been accused of truth and alchemy  
I've been accused of speaking out for freedom too  
I give a demonstration in front of a crowd  
A man saw my hands move and he began to shout  
  
Here come, here come, her come horsemen through the pass  
They say cast a cold eye on life, on death  
There's a battle for the truth  
And it means to thine own self be true  
This love will surely last forever  
This love will surely last always  
This love will surely last forever  
This love will surely last always

Listen Mr. DJ  
Won't you play me something slow  
Play me the songs  
For the lonely ones  
Play me something  
That I know  
  
Hey Mr. DJ  
I'm in a sad mood tonight  
Play me something just for me and my baby  
Won't you make everything alright  
  
I'm gonna turn it way down low  
Leave it on all night long  
Till the morning comes  
Like my lover my friend until the end  
And that special someone  
  
Hey Mr. DJ  
Play me Rainbow 66  
Cause I'm drifting like a ship out on the fog  
And I just don't know what's coming next  
  
Gonna turn it way down low  
Leave it on all night long  
Until the morning comes  
For my lover my friend until the end  
And that special someone  
  
Hey Mr. DJ  
Play me Rainbow 66  
Cause I'm drifting like a ship out on the sea  
And I just don't know what's coming next  
  
Well, Mr. DJ  
I'm in a sad mood tonight  
Play me something for me and my darling  
Want you to make everything  
Alright  
  
La, ta. ta, ta, tata

By the mansion on the hillside  
Red sports car comes driving down the road  
And pulls up into the driveway  
And a story does unfold  
  
She's standing by the rhododendrons  
Where the roses are in bloom  
Looking out at the Atlantic ocean  
And in her head she hums this tune  
  
Thank God the dark nights are drawing in again  
'cause high summer has got me down  
I'll wait till the end of August  
And get off this merry-go-round  
  
And they shut him out of paradise  
Called him Lucifer and frowned  
She took pride in what God made him  
Even before the angels shot him down to the ground  
  
He's a light out of the darkness  
And he wears a starry crown  
If you see him, nothing will shake him  
'cause high summer has got him low down  
  
High summer's got him lonesome  
Even when he makes the rounds  
There's been no two ways about it  
High summer's got him low down  
  
Checked in to the tiny village by the lakeside  
Settled down to start a new  
Far away from the politicians  
And the many chosen few  
  
Far away from the jealousy factor  
And everything that was tearing him apart  
Far away from the organ grinder  
And everyone that played their part  
  
And they shut him out of paradise  
Called him Lucifer and frowned  
'Cause he took pride in what God made him  
Even before the angels shot him to the ground  
  
He's a light out of the darkness  
And he wears a starry crown  
If you see him nothings shaken  
'cause high summer's got him low down  
  
High summer's on the rebound  
High summer's got him low down  
High summer's on the rebound  
High summer's got him down, low down  
High summer's on the rebound  
High summer's got him low down  
Low down

Well I'm higher than the world  
And I'm livin' in my dreams  
I'll make it better than it seems  
Today  
  
And I'm higher than a cloud  
And I'm living in the sound  
I'll make it better than it seems  
Today  
  
Higher than the world  
But my head is in a swirl  
I gotta give a life a whirl  
Today  
  
Higher than the clouds  
Wrapped up in the sound  
I'll make it better all around  
Today  
  
Higher than the world  
But my head is in a swirl  
I gotta give a life a whirl  
Today  
  
Higher in my mind  
I'm going leave these blues behind  
And I'll find what I find  
Today  
  
Cause I'm higher than the world  
And I'm wrapped up in my dreams  
I'll make it better than it seems  
Today  
  
Yes, I'm higher than the world  
And I'm livin' in my mind  
I got to hold on to what I find  
Today  
  
Just a little bit higher  
Little bit higher

Had my congregation, had my flock  
When I was a shepherd of men  
Chased the wild goose, chased the pot of gold  
Chased the rainbows end  
  
How can a poor boy deliver this message to you?  
How can a poor boy? You don't believe anything that's true  
  
Had my rise, had my downfall  
Now I'm gonna rise up again  
Had my degrees, my initiations  
Not speaking to the profane  
  
How can a poor boy get this message to you?  
How can a poor boy when you don't believe a thing that's true?  
  
I've been anointed, been appointed  
Even been magnified  
Spied a chapel all of gold  
The priest was laying down with the swine  
  
How can a poor boy get a little message to you?  
How can a poor boy when you don't believe anything is true?  
How can a poor boy get this message through to you?  
How can a poor boy when you don't believe a single thing is true?  
  
Watch the illusion of false security  
Play of the shadows that move  
Tell me what evil lurks in the hearts of men  
Only the shadow knows  
  
How can a poor boy get this message to you?  
How can a poor boy when you don't believe a thing that's true, for you  
When you don't believe a thing, nothing that's true for you  
How can a poor boy ever get next to you?

How long, how long baby  
Can this love of ours go on?  
How long, how long baby  
Because I know, I know you've been doing me wrong  
  
You've been seen all over town  
Playing the field putting me down  
How long can this go on?  
  
How long, how long baby  
Must you treat me like a fool?  
How long, how long baby  
Don't you know, you're breakin' the rules?  
  
Do you think it's only a game?  
The way that you're acting  
You'll drive me insane  
How long can this go on?  
  
I want to know, how long, how long baby,  
Must you tear my soul apart?  
How long, how long baby  
When you break, when you break my heart  
  
Oh won't you change your ways  
Come on back let me hear you say  
That we will start anew  
  
I need you so, I need you so  
I need you so, whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa

I could cry salty tears  
Where have I been all these years  
A little while, tell me now  
How long has this been going on?  
  
There were chills, up and down my spine  
Yes, there're thrills I can't define  
Listen sweet, while I repeat  
How long has this been going on?  
  
Oh I could feel that I could melt  
Into heaven I'm hurled  
Oh I know how leif erickson felt  
Finding another world  
Kiss me once, and then once more  
Oh what a dunce I was before  
What a break, for heaven's sake  
How long has this been going on?  
  
Repeat last verse

I'm hungry for your love  
I'm hungry for your love  
I'm hungry for your love  
But I can wait now  
  
I'm on the telephone  
And I am all alone  
I'm on the telephone  
And we're connected  
  
[Chorus]  
I got such a lot of love  
I want to give it to you  
I got such a lot of love  
I want to give it to you  
I got such a lot of love  
I want to give it to you  
  
And though we're far apart  
You are here in my heart  
And though we're far apart  
You're part of me now  
  
And after all the years  
And after all the tears  
And after all the tears  
There's just the truth now  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well, I'm hungry for your love  
Hungry for your love  
Well, I'm hungry, yeah, well, I'm hungry  
For your love now  
  
I love you in buckskin, yeah, yeah  
I love you in buckskin, yeah, yeah  
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you  
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you  
I love you now  
  
I'm hungry for your love

Oh my dear, oh my dear sweet love  
Oh my dear, oh my dear sweet love  
When I'm away from you, when I'm away from you  
Well I feel, yeah, well I feel so sad and blue  
Well I feel, well I feel so sad and blue  
Oh my dear, oh my dear, oh my dear sweet love  
When I'm away from you, I just have to sing, my hymns  
Hymns to the silence, hymns to the silence  
Hymns to the silence, hymns to the silence  
  
Oh my dear, oh my dear sweet love it's a long, long journey  
Long, long journey, journey back home  
Back home to you, feel you by my side  
Long journey, journey, journey  
Yeah in the midnight, in the midnight, I burn the candle  
Burn the candle at both ends, burn the candle at both ends  
Burn the candle at both ends, burn the candle at both ends  
And I keep on, 'cause I can't sleep at night  
Until the daylight comes through  
And I just, and I just, have to sing  
Sing my hymns to the silence  
Hymns to the silence, hymns to the silence  
My hymns to the silence  
  
I want to go out in the countryside  
Oh sit by the clear, cool, crystal water  
Get my spirit, way back to the feeling  
Deep in my soul, I want to feel  
Oh so close to the One, close to the One  
Close to the One, close to the One  
And that's why, I keep on singing baby  
My hymns to the silence, hymns to the silence  
Oh my hymns to the silence, hymns to the silence  
Oh hymns to the silence, oh hymns to the silence  
Oh hymns to the silence, hymns to the silence  
Oh my dear, my dear sweet love  
Can you feel the silence? can you feel the silence?  
Can you feel the silence? can you feel the silence?  
  
Hymns to the silence, hymns to the silence  
Hymns to the silence, hymns to the silence  
Hymns to the silence, hymns to the silence  
Hymns to the silence, hymns to the silence  
Hymns to the silence, hymns to the silence.

One of these days and it won't be long  
You're gonna look for me an' I'll be gone  
'Cause (I believe, yes I believe)  
Said I believe right now  
I believe, yes I believe  
Oh, I believe to my soul  
Tryin' to make a fool out of me  
  
I believe it!  
(I believe it)  
  
Oh, goin' 'round here wit' yo' head so hard, huh  
I think I'm gonna have to use my rod  
'Cause I believe (I believe) yes I (believe)  
Said I believe right now (I believe) yes I (believe)  
Whoa-oh, I believe to my soul  
Tryin' to make a fool outta me  
  
(I believe it)  
(I believe it)  
  
Last night I was dreamin' and I got your plan  
Saw you an' your girlfriend walkin' hand in hand  
That's why I believe (I believe, I believe)  
Said I believe right now (I believe, yes I believe)  
Whoa-whoa, I believe to my soul  
Tryin' to make a fool outta me  
  
I believe it !  
(I believe it)  
  
Last night I was dreamin' an' I dug your plan  
Saw you an' your girlfriend walkin' hand in hand  
And I believe, I believe yes (I believe)  
Said I believe right now (I believe, yes I believe)  
Whoa-whoa, I believe to my soul  
Tryin' to make a fool outta me  
  
I believe it!

I can't give you more than what I've got  
I can't expect to give what I have not  
I-I-I can only give ya lovin' 'till the sun goes down  
And, until the leaves of summer turn to shades of brown  
  
I try and I try  
But baby, you know that I  
Can only give you everything  
  
I can't argue with you to a-understand  
'Cause after all, I am just a man  
A you are on my mind  
When stars appear and shadows fall  
And when every little flower close  
And no birds call  
I try and I try  
But baby, you know that I  
Can only give you everything  
  
I'll do anything you want me to do  
'Cause I don't want to know there's life without you  
Ooh, ooh, ooh,  
Don't ever go and leave me in this world alone  
I-I-I'd be like a little child if I was on my own  
  
I try and I try  
But baby you know that I  
Can only give you everything  
  
Everything, baby  
A little bit of this, a little bit of that  
And everything  
Ooh, ooh, ooh  
  
Ooh, ooh, ooh  
Whoa, ooh, ooh  
Whoa, ooh, ooh  
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I can't stop loving you  
Since I made up my mind  
To live in memories  
Of a lonesome time  
  
I can't stop wanting you  
It's useless to say  
So I just live my life  
In dreams of yesterday  
  
Those happy hours  
Oh, those happy hours  
That we once knew  
Oh, that we once knew  
So long ago  
So long ago, baby  
Still make me blue  
Yeah, still make me blue  
They say the time  
They say that time  
Heals a broken heart  
Heal a broken heart  
But time has stood still  
But time has stood still  
Since we've been apart  
Oh, since we've been apart  
  
I can't stop loving  
Since I made up my mind  
Living in, live, live, live, live, live, live in memories  
Of a lone, lonesome time  
  
I can't stop wanting you  
It's useless to say  
So I just live my life  
In dreams of yesterday  
  
I can't stop loving you  
Since I made up my mind  
Oh, to live in memory, baby  
Of a lonesome time  
  
I can't stop wanting you  
It's useless to say  
So I just live my life  
In dreams of yesterday  
Of yesterday.

I don't want much in this world  
It's th' simple things I treasure  
'Till I die I would get by on fame, riches and sensual pleasure  
  
I don't ask much in this life  
No special consideration  
Just treat me like His Majesty  
Of a friendly OPEC nation  
  
Some people  
Just don't know when to stop  
Some people  
Just won't quit until they reach the top  
  
But I'm so easy going  
I'd make my way through life  
On love and understanding  
From a rich and beautiful life  
  
Some people  
Just never seem to get enough  
Some people  
Want salvation, paradise and all that stuff  
  
But I'm so easy going  
Don't even keep the score  
All I want is plenty, but I will take more  
If you ask me  
I will take more  
Say please  
I will  
Take more

I forgot that love existed troubled in my mind.  
Heartache after heartache, worried all the time.  
I forgot that love existed  
Then I saw the light  
Everyone around me make everything alright.  
  
Oh, oh Socrates and Plato they  
Praised it to the skies.  
Anyone who's ever loved  
Everyone who's ever tried.  
  
If my heart could do my thinking  
And my head begin to feel  
I would look upon the world anew  
And know what's truly real.

Whoa sometime, sometimes I get a little worried  
Well, but I want to tell ya all, it's alright, yeah  
  
[Chorus:]  
'Cause I got a woman way across town  
She's good to me, she's good to me  
I got a woman way 'cross town  
She's alright, she's alright  
  
She's my baby, don't ya understand?  
'Cause you know I'm her loving man  
I got a woman way across town  
She's good to me, yes she is  
  
Save her loving, kissing and a hugging  
Just for me, yes she does  
Save her loving, early in the morning  
Just for me, whoa yeah  
  
She's my baby  
Don't ya understand?  
Well ya know I'm her loving man  
Well I got a woman, right here in town  
She's alright, ready  
  
Hey!  
  
She's there to love me  
Both day and night  
She never grumbles or fusses  
Always treats me right  
  
Never on the streets  
Leaving me alone  
She knows a woman's place  
Right back there in her home  
  
Got a woman way across town  
She loves me  
She's my lady  
  
I got a woman, way across town  
She good to me, she good to me  
She's my baby  
Don't ya understand?

Got a little woman, way across town

Smile you smile is you and I  
See through your laughing eyes  
The smile you smile is you and I  
See through your laughing eyes  
Oh, baby  
In the whirlpool of them, I  
Can be in paradise  
  
I'd go roamin' in the gloamin'  
And ever and a day with you  
Oh yes, I will  
I'd go roamin' in the gloamin'  
And ever and a day with you  
Oh baby  
Sit between the stars and say  
That's my point of view  
Oh yes  
  
I yi, yi, yi, love you  
  
I yi, yi, yi yi, love you  
  
In the purple heather  
On a hillside mountain fog we'll stray  
Oh yeah  
In the purple heather  
On a hillside mountain fog we'll stray  
  
Oh yeah  
An' chase the colored grass  
Around us in the same old way  
  
I yi, yi, yi, yi love you, baby  
I yi, yi, yi, yi love you, oh yeah.

Sailed on the Sloop John be  
My granddaddy and me  
'Round Nassau town we did roam  
We'd been drinkin' all night  
Well I got into a fight  
Yeah and I feel so broke up  
I want to go home  
  
Hoist up the John be sail's  
See how the mainsail sets  
Send for the Captain ashore  
And let me go home  
I want to go home, I want to go home, yeah  
'Cause I feel so broke up, I want to go home  
Yes I do  
(He's so broke up, Lord, I want to go home)  
  
Well Captain's a wicked man  
He gets drunk any time he can  
And he don't give a damn for grandpappy  
No, nor me  
He kicks us around  
And he knocks us about  
Well I feel so broke up, I  
I want to go home  
  
Well pull up the John be 's sails  
See how the mainsail sets  
Send for the Captain ashore  
And let me go home  
I want to go home  
Well, I want to go home  
'Cause I feel so broke up (he's so broke up)  
I want to go home  
(Yes I do)  
I feel so broke up  
(He so broke up)  
Lord, that I want to go home  
Home

Whenever the sunshine comes through  
Whenever my thoughts turn to you  
Whatever you want me to do  
I will be there  
  
Whether I crawl uphill  
Try to not be through the mill  
Just as long as I fit the bill  
I will be there  
  
If it's on a lazy afternoon in summertime  
And you're drinking champagne and wine  
Anytime, I don't mind  
Even if I've got the blues  
And after I pay all my dues  
You decide to go for a cruise  
I will be there  
  
And if it's on a lazy afternoon in summertime  
And you're drinking champagne and wine  
Anytime, I don't mind  
And even if I've got the blues  
I'm tired of paying oh so many dues  
And you decide to go for a cruise  
Going to grab my razor and my suitcase  
And my toothbrush and my overcoat  
And my underwear  
I will be there
