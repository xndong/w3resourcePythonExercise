There's a whisper on the wind tonight  
It tells me what the angels and lovers said  
This desire  
Is not ordinary  
Love is screaming at you  
  
If the moon should turn red over your head don't let her go  
Just believe it's your time here is the sign what angels and lovers find  
  
You find a love like this once in your life  
A diamond in your hand not a piece of glass  
Picture you  
Looking back on what you've  
Done to lose all this time  
  
If the moon should turn red over your head don't let her go  
If the sea should turn dry don't let him fly don't say goodbye  
If the planets collide don't run and hide change his mind  
Just believe it's your time here is the sign what angels and lovers find  
  
This desire  
Is not ordinary  
Love is screaming at you  
  
If the moon should turn red over your head don't let her go  
If the sea should turn dry don't let him fly don't say goodbye  
If the planets collide don't run and hide change his mind  
Just believe it's your time here is the sign what angels and lovers find

So we're lookin' out on the world and what do we see  
Another screen full of horror, another atrocity,  
What can I do as simple man who wants to make a difference,  
Wants to do what he can, not just talk about it.  
  
Stone drops in a pond, stirs the sediment, sends ripples, to the edge of the
world,  
  
A teenage boy with a rubber band around his arm, finds a vein and a back road
into the dark and stops the pain.  
  
Another chance, another day to mend, to change, to start again  
  
A young woman with a deadly belt around her waist,  
Steps on the bus with no regret for her life and the lives she will take,  
A leader in the rapture of his absolute right will not connect with a young
man wrapped in the flag, in a black bag.  
  
Voice raised in a room of silence, conquers fear, takes action, starts the
journey, starts the journey  
  
Baby born with an open mind and a trusting face has no regard for distinction,
says to have hope is to be human  
  
Another chance, another day to mend, to change, to start again  
  
Another chance, another day  
Another chance, another day  
to mend, to change, to start again  
  
Another chance, another day  
Another chance, another day  
to mend, to change, to start again  
  
Another chance, another day to mend, to change, to start again

Soon the warm night breezes roll on in  
A steamy blanket for the shore  
This is streetlight time  
You said you were mine  
So the fool believes  
What the night conceives  
The light of love is in your eyes  
Is in your smile again  
Is in your life again  
Was a time when love grew cold for you  
Turned your back on memories  
I was there for you  
I will see you through  
Darkest hours fade  
The promises we made  
Were not the kind to fade away  
We'll face another day  
We'll face another day  
When that was yesterday  
Will the ocean rollers bring you home  
Or will they take you out to sea  
This is real-time  
And you are still mine  
The fool that loves his dreams  
Breaks the cruelest schemes  
The light of love is in your eyes  
Is in your smile again  
Is in your life again  
Back in your smile again  
Back in your life again  

Last of the trouble has followed through  
This [?] your potential to  
I've seen your lifeline go out to you  
Sidestepping our convention  
  
But you always managed to find a way  
To avoid what the negative people say  
The sun will shine on a brighter day  
Stick to your own potential  
  
Failing hardly seems to bother you  
Winning was a compliment to failure  
  
A waking Earth is calling you  
Drive all night, you can't sit still  
Here comes the torment that eats inside  
[?] those who wish you well  
  
The callings strong but how can you hear  
Receivers dead, the transmissions clear  
The Moon will rise in your finest hour  
Lighting our potential  
  
Caught in perversion of our Human life  
Fall in confusion born of sacrifice  
  
But you always managed to find a way  
To avoid what the negative people say  
The sun will shine on a brighter day  
When you stick to your own potential  
Failing hardly seems to bother you  
Winning was a compliment to failure  
Failure!  
  
(Instrumental)  
  
Failing hardly seems to bother you  
Winning was a compliment to failure  
Failure!  
  
(Spoken)  
[?] to make a life, Beckon it  
Bodies of great beauty could not surrender  
Their rationality fading in [?]  
The security of sensation  
  
A historic harlequin [?] harks a mild  
The spirit of radio mortgage  
Holding their pre selection  
In the brutality of fact

Acoustic Version  
  
  
  
There's a person that I know  
OK its you and me  
Keeps coming up against a brick wall  
Always blaming and complaining but sustaining  
While their luck doesn't change at all  
Obstacles and ridicule  
Are common in his head  
Does he even listen  
To that collective heartbeat  
  
Here's the card that you've been given  
Its not much but its neatly written  
And here's the life that you are living  
Choose a role that you feel happy in  
  
You get hurt and end up leaving  
But to stay is most revealing  
Take the knocks and get the meaning  
Before moving on up to hit the imaginary ceiling  
  
Beyond that firewall is a devastating view  
Take the time to listen to the collective heartbeats  
  
Here's the card that you've been given  
Its not much but its neatly written  
And here's the life that you are living  
Choose a role that you feel happy in  
  
You can go round it or under it or over it or back away  
Face on ,head to head  
  
idle away tomorrow but today  
  
Here's the card that you've been given  
Its not much but its neatly written  
And here's the life that you are living  
Choose a role that you feel happy in  
  
Choose a role that you feel happy in  
Choose a role that you feel happy in  
Choose a role that you feel happy in  
Choose a role that you feel happy in  
Choose a role that you feel happy in  
Choose a role that you feel happy in

Well you're not, you're not who you think you are  
Well we think that you are john or dave  
But you're not, you're not who you think you are  
Jumbled mass of preconceived ideas  
  
From our birth we were given an identity  
People told us we were great or small  
From our birth we were given rules of right or wrong  
Not forgetting the bullies at school  
  
The world teaches us to think that life is full of limitations  
The world tries to make us think that there are loads of limits  
The world teaches us to think that life is full of limitations  
The world tries to make us think that there are loads of limits  
  
Welcome to conditioning  
Welcome to conditioning  
  
And as the world makes us feel great  
And as the world makes us feel small  
Oh so convinced of our identity  
If we only knew it we just can't believe it we just won't believe it  
  
Leading us to think that we are such a success  
Conning us to think that we are just a failure  
Leading us to think that we are so intelligent  
Conning us to think that we are just a do-do do-do  
  
Welcome to conditioning  
Welcome to conditioning  
  
Who is to say what is what  
Welcome to conditioning  
Who is to say what is what  
Welcome to conditioning  
Who is to say what is what  
Er, sorry, ha ha  
Who is to say what is what  
Welcome to conditioning  
Who is to say what is what  
Welcome to conditioning  
Who is to say what is what  
Welcome to conditioning

I met an alien one night while I was walking after dark  
He said don't be afraid I've come to know I've come to make my mark  
And there's a road, and it's very long  
And you gotta be sweet baby  
And you gotta be strong  
He said why are these men and women lying here just on the street  
He said why are these children dying 'cause' they have no food to eat  
And there's a road, and it's very long  
And you gotta be sweet baby  
And you gotta be strong  
Why are these people hating others for the colour of their skin  
Why are your brother creatures murdered for the flesh that lies within  
Don't lose the rage, don't become immune  
When others criticise you  
Don't change your tune  
You've got to love, with a passion that hurts  
It's love that conquers baby  
Its love that serves  
And in the moment before you go to sleep  
You can turn on me I'm the blue light wrap me round you  
And when the world turns it's coldest shoulder  
In the name of all that's good  
And there's a road, and it's very long  
And you gotta be sweet baby  
And you gotta be strong  
And I'll be there, to dry your tears  
And I'll be cooking in your kitchen  
Food for everyone  
And ill be working in the backroom  
Help for everyone  

It's not my fault if you didn't live out your  
Youthful dreams  
Now you want to backtrack, how different it all seems  
Love seems to be like alcohol, evaporates before your eyes  
The bonds that once were welcome, become the chains we despise  
Chorus  
When you cross that line, there's no turning back  
When you cross that line, don't come knocking at my door  
Everyone has got to take some responsibility  
The grass is rarely bluer, but you wouldn't take it from me  
Finding out the hard way can be an endless affair  
I'd stop you if I could, but then again, I wouldn't dare  
I'm telling you when I say these words, that  
They're not spoken in bitterness  
That destructive emotion has long ago left  
And these tears that cleanse the soul and let me  
Start afresh  
When you cross that line, what more can I say  
When you cross that line, we are no more  
We are no more  

With one thing and another  
Banged my head against the wall  
Always looking over my shoulder  
And it makes no sense at all  
Chorus  
I'm going to dig this well deep  
It's a promise I must keep  
I'm going to dig this well deep  
'cause I want to find water  
I'm going to dig this well deep  
Going to sow before I reap  
I'm going to dig this well deep  
'cause I want to find water  
Cynics try to hold me in the graveyard of their egos  
Put my dreams out with the trashman and they left me on a plateau  
Holding on and keeping strong  
When you are walking on a tightrope  
Holding on and keeping strong  
When you are wilted down to your last last hope  
See it through to a conclusion even if it leads to nowhere  
Sometimes there is no solution but the water tastes as good there  

Some people I know have given up on their lives  
Drowning their sorrows, and mumblin', and forgot the fight  
We can tip the balance we can break those barriers down  
Little things count as much as the big and turn it all around  
  
And it's oh, don't always look at the rain  
No, don't look at the rain  
  
Some people I know have lost their feel for mystery  
They say everything has got to be proved, this isn't a nursery  
And joseph who's five years old, stops fights in his playground yard  
No more fights and bigotry, oh is it so hard  
  
And it's oh, don't always look at the rain  
No, don't always look at the rain  
Ha, don't always look at the rain  
  
And tell me, is it a crime to have an ideal or two  
Evolving takes it's time, we can't do it all in one go  
Doesn't have to drive us all mad, we can only do our best  
Let the mind shut up, and the heart do the rest

Don't put these curses on me oh no you don't  
Don't put these curses on  
Don't put these curses on me oh no you don't  
Don't put these curses on  
  
Don't curse me with the love of money  
It will burn me up and waste my time  
Don't curse me with the love of intellect  
You know it knots up my brain and makes me think that  
You know more than I do  
  
Don't put these curses on me oh no you don't  
Don't put these curses on  
Don't put these curses on me oh no you don't  
Don't put these curses on  
  
Don't curse me with the idea  
That work is good and holy  
It only took you to the grave with a bitter heart  
Don't curse me with this patriotic love  
Of parents, ideas, country and wife  
You invite war into your home  
  
Don't put these curses on me oh no you don't  
Don't put these curses on  
Don't put these curses on me oh no you don't  
Don't put these curses on  
  
Don't put these curses on me oh no you don't  
Don't put these curses on  
Don't put these curses, these curses on me oh no you don't  
Don't put these curses on

Don't want to fight anymore oh no  
Don't want to cry anymore no more  
Don't want to fight anymore oh no  
Don't want to cry anymore no more  
  
One nation  
One family  
No limitation  
No enemy  
  
No I don't want to fight anymore  
No I don't, I don't, no I don't  
No I don't want to cry anymore  
Don't want to cry  
No I don't, I don't  
No I don't, oh no  
  
No weapons  
No secrecy  
All slogans  
Blind loyalty  
  
No I don't want to fight anymore  
No I don't, I don't, no I don't, no I don't  
No I don't want to cry anymore  
No I don't, I don't, no I don't, no I don't  
  
You know I don't, you know I don't  
You know I don't, you know I don't want to cry  
You know I don't, you know I don't  
You know I don't, you know I don't  
You know I don't, you know I don't  
You know I don't, you know I don't want to fight  
You know I don't, you know I don't  
  
No righteous  
No cruelty  
No weapons  
No self-defense  
No quarrel  
No arrogance  
No hurt you  
Rise above revenge  
  
No I don't want to fight anymore  
No I don't, no I don't don't don't  
No I don't want to cry anymore  
No I don't no I don't  
  
Do I want to fight anymore oh no  
Don't want to cry anymore no more  
I don't no I don't  
No I don't want to fight anymore  
I don't no I don't  
  
Don't want to fight anymore oh no  
Don't want to cry anymore no more  
No I don't want to fight anymore  
No I don't no I don't  
No I don't want to cry anymore  
No I don't no I don't no I don't!

Please don't look at me this way  
I am from the same seed as you  
Take me back to the womb  
I am weary of this life  
  
Don't believe in my eyes  
Don't believe in my mind  
Don't believe in right or wrong  
Don't believe in cruel or kind  
  
But all this talk is only poetry  
Only as true as we would believe  
We must live to fight the negative  
Not to court the self in defeat oh oh oh oh  
In defeat oh oh oh oh  
  
Oh the pain of life is sweet  
Is it wrong to long for death?  
Must I cling to the thrills of life  
Ash to ash and dust to dust  
  
But all this talk is only poetry  
Only as true as we would believe  
We must live to fight the negative  
Not court the self in defeat oh oh oh oh  
In defeat oh oh oh oh  
  
You have looked at me this way  
We are all from the same seed  
Take us forward through the tomb  
There's no finish to a life

Everybody wants to feel happy, even if you think that you don't  
Everyone wants to know the secret, even if you think that you don't  
Everybody thinks they're different from the next man now  
But we just got to realize we're just the same  
  
Always appear to be someone better  
You know there will always appear to be someone worse  
You know there'll always appear to be someone better  
You know there'll always appear to be someone worse, oh  
  
Everyone has got their character  
Everyone has got their personality  
But the longing is still the same  
So what is the answer by easy on yourself  
Make yourself feel at ease maybe that's the answer  
  
Always appear to be someone better  
You know there will always appear to be someone worse  
Always appear to be someone better  
You know there'll always appear to be someone worse, oh  
  
We're just the same don't you know  
We're just the same don't you know  
Looking over there  
He looks different, she looks different  
They might even be different  
But we're just the same, don't you know  
We're just the same, don't you know  
We're just the same

He wasn't looking for a pretty face  
She wasn't searching for the latest style  
He didn't want someone who walked straight off the TV  
She needed someone with an interior smile  
  
She wasn't looking for a cuddle in the back seat  
He wasn't looking for a five minute thrill  
She wasn't thinking of tomorrow or of next week  
This vacancy he meant to permanently fill  
  
I need an everlasting love  
I need a friend and a lover divine  
An everlasting precious love  
Wait for it, wait for it, give it some time  
  
Back in the world of disposable emotion  
In the climate of temporary dreams  
He wasn't looking for a notch on his bedpost  
A love to push, pull and burst at the seams  
  
This is love worth waiting for  
Something special, something pure  
  
This is love worth waiting for  
Bitterness will die for sure  
Something special, something pure  
This is love worth waiting for.

I want to be...  
The coffee in your pot  
I want to be the shower in the morning  
That's steamy and hot  
  
I want to be...  
The cherry that paints your lips  
I want to be the stick shift  
At your fingertips  
  
What ever I think of its never enough  
To show you my love  
I want to be your everything!  
  
I want to be...  
The wine that swirls around your tongue  
I want to be the Harley  
That you sit upon  
  
I want to be...  
The elvis that makes you scream and shake  
I want to be the velvet  
That hugs your pretty shape  
  
What ever I think of its never enough  
To show you my love  
I want to be your everything!  
  
The trouble is you just don't know who the hell I am  
But I'll change that little detail, if I can  
  
What ever I think of its never enough  
To show you my love  
I want to be... I want to be your everything!  
  
The trouble is you don't even know who the hell I am  
But I'll change that little detail, if I can  
  
What ever I think of its never enough  
To show you my love  
I want to be... I want to be... I want to be your everything!  
  
I want to be your everything! (that's all just everything)  
I want to be your everything! (that's all just everything)  
I want to be your... I want to be your...  
I want to be your everything! (that's all just everything)

They're sending back pictures from Saturn and Mars  
Maybe this will be our new home  
Well we seem to have messed up  
And we must look to the stars  
Our paradise we seem to have outgrown  
  
Join the line  
Put down your name  
Get ready for a ride on the exodus plane  
  
Well we've been much too greedy  
Wanting too much to fast  
But we have to say we are what we are  
Well the trees and the plants and the animals have gone  
Long ago  
Used to be real air to breath, they say so  
  
Join the line  
Put down your name  
Get ready for a ride on the exodus plane  
Join the line  
Put down your name  
Get ready for new life  
  
Anyway it's too late for what might have been  
Kiss the earth goodbye and get out of here  
If there's anybody out there  
Hope they haven't made the same mistakes  
Turning gold into garbage and a banquet into dustcakes  
  
Join the line  
Put down your name  
Get ready for a ride on the exodus plane  
Join the line  
Put down your name  
Get ready for new life  
  
Join the line  
Put down your name  
Get ready for a ride on the exodus plane  
  
Get ready for new life

Got to get to know your mind  
Let it be your friend  
Don't be scared of what you'll find  
Let's not pretend  
  
Say it isn't true  
You gave up on your dream  
Blinded by the spotlight  
Falling through the screen  
  
You got to be strong  
You go to fight on  
For everyone  
  
Hold a mirror to your life  
Polish night and day  
You can find the clear blue sky  
When the tarnish scrapes away  
  
Hold on a minute  
Let me be your friend  
Strict as you want it  
Or gently take the bends  
  
You got to be strong  
You go to fight on  
For everyone  
  
There are times when the snowstorm hits  
And everything becomes a blur of cold and white  
Then you know that you must fight  
And believe that mountains shift  
And when the snowstorm lifts  
You'll see the sun and the moon so clear

For you see me  
For you see me  
For you hear me  
For you hear me  
For you touch me  
For you touch me  
For you feel me  
For you feel me  
  
For you see me  
For you see me  
For you hear me  
For you hear me  
For you touch me  
For you touch me  
For you feel me  
For you feel me  
  
For you see me...............  
  
Everything reflected  
The eye can see  
The you connected to me  
  
For you see me  
Celebrate one more day of this life and our eternity  
For you see me  
Celebrate one more day of this life and our eternity  
For you see me  
Celebrate one more day of this life and our eternity  
For you see me  
Celebrate one more day of this life and our eternity  
  
The you connected to me

I'm not one to complain  
But things get heavy now and again  
These obstacles leave  
Little scars on the brain  
  
Give me strength to carry on  
Give me strength to carry on  
  
I know this worrying  
Makes my body ill  
Stops me reaching the heights  
Where we all belong  
  
Give me strength to carry on  
Give me strength I must feel strong  
Give me strength to carry on  
Give me strength I must feel strong  
  
I will relax in your arms  
Feel like a newborn babe  
I'll be floating in space  
Watching the world turn around  
  
Give me strength to carry on  
Give me strength I must feel strong  
Give me strength to carry on  
Feels like all my hope is gone  
  
Relax in your arms  
Like a newborn babe  
Floating in space  
And watch the world turn around  
Problems seem to fade  
Weightless in the air  
  
No need to worry  
Leave it behind  
I'm not one to complain  
But thing get heavy now and again  
Getting through these obstacles  
Leaves scars on the brain  
You make me feel  
There is no need to worry  
It will be fine  
Given some time

The film script lies ahead  
Change the future, change the past  
Choose the players, choose the role  
Cast of thousands, cast of few  
Imagination decides the plot  
Play the good guy, play the bad  
Here's the victim, here's the saint  
Here's the canvas, here's the paint  
Good luck bad luck who knows  
Good luck bad luck who knows  
The world is peopled by many winds  
Whirling faster than the wind  
Solving a dilemma of life and death  
Trying to make some sense of it all  
No good blaming the outside world  
Pleasure and pain are in the mind  
Whether we like it or whether we don't  
We found as much as we wanted to find  
Good luck, bad luck who knows  
Good luck, bad luck  
Good luck, bad luck who knows  
Good luck, bad luck  
Good luck, bad luck who knows  
Good luck, bad luck  
We can make it horror we can make it blue  
We can make it slow time, make it move  
The director sits behind those eyes  
Play it straight or in disguise  
Imagination decides the plot  
Play the good guy play the bad  
Here's the victim, here's the saint  
Here's the canvas and here's the paint  
Good luck, good  
Good luck bad luck who knows  
Good luck bad luck who knows?  

You're walkin' 'round like a doll without a head  
You should be thinking 'bout how to give your love instead  
I've seen you lying and cheating your way  
Then you complain about what all of your friends say  
You shoot your mouth like you damn well own the world  
We always have to keep our little white flags unfurled  
Just try to finish the things that you start  
Stop thinking with your fists  
And start thinking with your heart  
Oh can't you see  
Oh what you could be now  
You never listen to me  
Oh you're like a gun turned on the world  
Things have to be attempted one step at a time  
You got to take that poison from your eyes  
You know the lights are going out in your life  
Your killing yourself with your own knife  
Oh can't you see  
Oh what you could be now  
You never listen to me  
Oh you're like a gun turned on the world  
You don't want a love you need a chaperone  
You want a first-class alibi  
You bore the pants off people on the telephone  
People are sick of your lies  
You better open your eyes  
You're like a gun turned on the world, like a gun  
You're takin' one step forward then two steps back  
Friendly advice gets treated like a heart attack  
You can drown in the shallow water of hate  
Get the sense before it's too late now  
Oh can't you see  
Oh what you could be now  
You never listen to me  
Oh you're like a gun turned on the world  
Oh can't you see  
Oh what you could be now  
You never listen to me  
Oh you're like a gun turned on the world  

There was a time when there was nothing at all  
  
Nothing at all  
Just a distant hum.  
There was a being and he lived on his own  
He had nd one to talk to and nothing to do.  
He drew up the plans  
Learnt to work with his hands  
  
A million years passed by and his work was done.  
And his words where these:  
Hope you find it in everything  
  
Everything that you see  
  
Hope you find it in everything  
  
Everything that you see  
  
Hope you find it  
Hope you find it  
  
Hope you find me in you.  
So she had built her  
Elaborate home with it's ups and  
It's downs  
It's rain and it's sun.  
She decided that her work  
It was done  
Time to have fun  
  
And found a game to play.  
Then as part of the game  
  
She completely forgot  
Where she'd hidden herself  
And she spent the rest of her time  
Trying to find the parts.  
  
Hope you find it in everything  
Everything that you see  
...  
There was a time when there was nothing at all  
  
Nothing at all  
Just a distant hum.

Sometimes I'd like to go to bed  
With a hundred women or men  
And lose my mind in lust and drink  
And to hit some people into feeling good, oh  
  
Sometimes I'd like to dance in the street  
Don't wanna go to work, just wanna lay in bed all day  
  
Why don't you then  
Why don't you then  
  
Life just seems oh so meaningless  
And who can blame us for wanting these things  
But you just try being free my friend  
And everyone will hate your guts, I only want to free

Spare a thought for the souls  
Who cannot leave this earth  
The attachments bind so tightly, not a chance  
Not a chance of a new birth  
The river gently beckons  
But the answer is no  
Gripping their illusions  
They cannot let them go  
Hunger for the flesh  
Leads them to a weaker heart  
Mortals who imprisoned themselves  
Let them have a new start  
Wishing to hold onto life and all it's games  
Singing their lament song  
Holding back the change  
They came here for to dance  
To learn and not to cling  
Holding onto life  
As if it were the important thing  
Hunger for the flesh  
Hunger for security  
Caught up in the mesh  
Caught up for eternity  
Hunger for the flesh  
Hunger for security  
Caught up in the mesh  
Caught up for eternity  
The river gently beckons  
But the answer is no  
Gripping their illusions  
They cannot let them go  
Hunger for the flesh  
Leads them to a weaker heart  
Mortals who imprison themselves  
Let them have a new start  
Let them have a new start  
Hunger for the flesh  
Hunger for security  
Caught up in the mesh  
Caught up for eternity  
Hunger for the flesh  
Hunger for security  
Caught up in the mesh  
Holding back the change  

Messing around I've wasted my time for years  
Listening to friends who keep filling me up with ideas  
Having deep talks with scholars who sound so fine  
Hearing this sham is like getting drunk on cheap wine  
  
Well it's time for a change  
I've got to move on  
There's got to be more than this  
The feeling is strong  
  
Look in better places gonna look inside  
Gonna get higher something is pulling me on  
Breaking down the old ways feeling no regret  
Gone are the shaky sands I've been building on  
  
Well it's time for a change  
Well I've lost lots of friends  
I've got to move on  
By sticking to my ground  
There's got to be more than this  
I don't give a damn  
The feeling is strong  
Just look what I've found  
  
Here I come now got no time to frown  
Nothing in my way now nothing can bring me down  
Feel that surge open the doors around  
Higher and higher the world is my hunting ground  
  
Well it's time for a change  
I've got to move on  
There's got to be more than this  
The feeling is strong

You let me paint  
The colours of your mind  
The love that remains wont fade over time  
You'll be alright  
So baby don't cry  
I'll be the sunset in your sky  
I'll be the soft winds you feel passing by  
So chin up my darlin'  
Ill be there on that distant horizon  
That hurts me so  
But I must go  
  
You let me be the person that I am  
Through my confusion you helped me stand  
I'll be alright  
So baby don't cry  
I'll be the sunset in your sky  
I'll be the soft winds you feel passing by  
So chin up my darling  
I'll be there on that distant horizon  
That hurts me so  
But I must go  
  
So chin up my darlin'  
I'll be there on that distant horizon  
It hurts be so  
But I must go  
I must go  
  
I will search every star 'till I find where you are  
And take you home  
So chin up my darlin'  
I'll be there on that distant horizon  
It hurts me so  
But I must go  
  
I must go

(Duet with Juliane Werding)  
  
I remember the first time... First time... First time  
I remember the first time  
When you touch me  
When you touch me  
  
Du hast gelogen  
Mich belogen und betrogen  
Du hast gelogen  
Das bricht mir das Herz  
  
Ich hab es gestern erfahren  
Und ich kam mir so bl? D vor  
Ein Freund hat euch gesehen  
Ich hab geglaubt du bist anders  
Mu? Ich das wirklich haben?  
Ich kann dich nicht verstehen  
  
Du hast gelogen  
Mich belogen und betrogen  
Du hast gelogen  
Das bricht mir das Herz  
  
I remember the first time  
When you touch me  
And my heart was going round and round  
I remember the first time  
When you touch me  
And my heart was going round  
My heart was going round and round  
  
Doch ich werd nie mehr wieder daran denken  
Diese Erinnerung wer ich dir schenken  
Denn du sagst du verstehst mich  
Denn du f? Hlst nicht dasselbe was ich f? Hl  
  
Kann schon sein, da? Du Recht hast  
Das ich das hier zu eng seh  
Egal, es geht um mich  
Wenn du jedesmal fremd gehst  
Wenn auch nur in Gedanken  
Nein, das ertrag ich nicht  
  
I remember the first time  
When you touch me  
And my heart was going round and round  
I remember the first time  
When you kiss me  
And my heart was going round  
My heart was going round and round  
  
Doch ich werd nie mehr wieder daran denken  
Diese Erinnerung werd ich dir schenken  
Denn du sagst, du verstehst mich  
Und ich wei?, du verstehst nicht  
Denn du f? Hlst nicht dasselbe was ich f? Hl  
  
I remember... I remember  
I remember the first time  
When you touch me  
And my heart was going round and round  
I remember the first time  
When you kiss me  
And my heart was going round  
My heart was going round and round  
  
Doch ich werd nie mehr wieder daran denken  
Diese Erinnerung werd ich dir schenken  
Denn du sagst, du verstehst mich  
Und ich wei?, du verstehst nicht  
Denn du f? Hlst nicht dasselbe was ich f? Hl

Chorus  
If you love  
You know you're gonna feel the hurt  
See the flowers  
Growin' from the muddy earth  
You never see the sun  
You're never gonna feel the rain  
With your life under glass  
In the middle lane  
You'll never feel the joy  
Never feel the pain  
Chorus  
Try to build a house on top of the highest tree  
It's dangerous and a bit risky  
But what about the view  
See the clouds and the mountains too  
Chorus  
Get your hands dirty  
Get a little insane  
Come out and play with me  
Barefoot in the rain  
If you love  
You know you're gonna feel the hurt  
(feel the joy, feel the pain)  
See the flowers  
Growin' from the muddy earth  
(you see the sun and then you see the rain)  
You never see the sun  
You're never gonna feel the rain  
With your life under glass  
In the middle lane  
You'll never feel the joy  
Never feel the pain  
If you love  
You know you're gonna feel the hurt  
(feel the joy, feel the pain)  
See the flowers  
Growin' from the muddy earth  
(you see the sun and then you see the rain)  
If you love  
You know you're gonna feel the hurt  
Growin' from the muddy earth  
(feel the joy, feel the pain)  
Never feel the pain  
(you see the sun and then you see the rain)  

Donald fagen  
  
Standing tough under stars and stripes  
We can tell  
This dream's in sight  
You've got to admit it  
At this point in time that it's clear  
The future looks bright  
On that train all graphite and glitter  
Undersea by rail  
Ninety minutes from new york to paris  
Well by seventy-six we'll be A. O. K.  
  
Chorus  
What a beautiful world this will be  
What a glorious time to be free  
  
Get your ticket to that wheel in space  
While there's time  
The fix is in  
You'll be a witness to that game of chance in the sky  
You know we've got to win  
Here at home we'll play in the city  
Powered by the sun  
Perfect weather for a streamlined world  
There'll be spandex jackets for everyone  
  
On that train all graphite a glitter  
Undersea by rail  
Ninety minutes from new york to paris  
(more leisure for artists everywhere)  
A just machine to make big decisions  
Programmed by fellows with compassion and vision  
We'll be clean when their work is done  
We'll be eternally free yes and eternally young

Is there a difference between yes and no  
Is there a difference between up and down  
Must I fear what others fear  
What nonsense  
  
Some people are content  
Enjoying things that belong to tradition  
With the seasons they cast their lot  
Without a question  
  
Other men are clear and bright and solid  
Other men are sharp and clever and jolly  
And we go wo oh oh wo oh oh oh wo  
  
Is there a difference between high and low  
Is there a difference between then and now  
Do we have to live in pain and fear  
What nonsense  
  
People are drifting like the waves on the sea  
Without direction like the restless wind  
Not knowing forward not knowing back  
Just existing  
  
Other men are strong and full of courage  
Other men are witty and full of knowledge  
And we go wo oh oh wo oh oh wo  
  
Other men are clear and bright and solid  
I alone am drifting on the sea  
Other men are sharp and clever and jolly  
Restless like the wind  
And we go wo oh oh wo oh oh wo  
  
Is there a difference  
Is there really a difference  
Yes and no  
Is there a difference  
Up and down  
Is there a difference  
High and low  
Is there a difference  
Then and now  
Is there a difference  
Yes and no  
Is there a difference  
Up and down  
Is there a difference

Matter matter oh no no  
  
If i haven't got any friends  
It just doesn't matter  
If nobody understands well  
It just doesn't matter  
If Im not good to anyone  
It just doesn't matter  
If Im completely alone  
It just doesn't matter  
  
If I've been misunderstood  
It just doesn't matter  
My best friends think Im no good  
It just doesn't matter  
If my horoscope looks bad  
It just doesn't matter  
My girlfriend even thinks Im mad  
It just doesn't matter  
  
(Instrumental)  
  
If my world falls apart  
It just doesn't matter  
I'll pick it up right from the start  
It just doesn't matter  
(?) Me up  
It just doesn't matter  
My children have had enough  
It just doesn't matter  
  
Matter matter oh no no

Did we fail to see you crumble  
Did we watch you fade to black  
Jaw hanging brain aching no one can handle  
Did we forget?  
To understand  
Did you have it planned?  
We all thought that we knew you so well  
  
So much love to give and take  
Many dreams and plans to make  
Can't believe it we knew you so well  
  
Hardly bare to think what you went through  
As your feet fell through the air  
Hanging in a void of hopeless darkness  
Way beyond despair  
But you made us doubt  
We would've heard your cry  
Of desolation  
We went there as well  
  
So much love to give and take  
Must go on to celebrate  
What you gave us  
You knew us so well  
  
Rippling through a generation  
Aftershocks for years to come  
The angry final step is taken  
Never to be undone  
On the other side  
Was a wave to ride  
Through the storm cloud  
To bring you to shore  
  
So much love to give and take  
Must go on to celebrate  
What you gave us  
You knew us so well

Like to get to know you well  
Like to get to know you well  
Like to get to know you well  
So we can be one  
We can be one together  
  
Like to get to know you well  
Like to get to know you well  
Like to get to know you well  
So we can be one  
We can be one together  
  
Together we can cast away the fear  
Together we can wipe away the tear  
Together we can strip down the barriers  
And be one  
  
Don't want to talk about the weather  
Don't want to talk about the news  
Just want to get to the real you inside  
  
Like to get to know you well  
Like to get to know you well  
Like to get to know you well  
So we can be one  
We can be one together  
  
Don't you think now is the time  
We should be feelin'  
Just want to simply say  
Won't let you slip away  
  
People want to talk about the future  
Don't want to linger on the past  
Just want to reach to the real you inside  
Forget cold glances and rejections  
Leave the things that separate  
Build on a trust that we can stand on  
  
Like to get to know you well  
Like to get to know you well  
Like to get to know you well  
So we can be one  
We can be one together  
  
Finding all are insecure  
Opening the same door  
Leaving out a stubborn pride  
Seeing from another side  
  
Like to get to know you well  
Like to get to know you well  
Like to get to know you well  
So we can be one  
We can be one together

Look mama  
I love you  
But you gotta let me live my life.  
Look mama  
I love you  
But you gotta let me live my life.  
  
Don't wrap me up in cotton wool  
  
You cannot treat me like a fool.  
Anyway if I was  
You gotta let me be the one.  
O. K.  
Give me your advice  
  
It's not my fault if I can't be wise  
  
Show me a person who hasn't been done.  
Look mama  
I love you  
But you gotta let me live my life. .. .  
  
Don't try to stick your rules on me  
  
I wasn't born as a carbon copy.  
I came out of you  
But don't think you own me.  
I have my respect for you  
I won't try to change  
The things you do. Give me a break  
  
Let me learn it my way. You think you know more  
Than me  
Experience hasn't set you free.  
  
Look mama  
I love you  
Look mama look  
Look mama look.  
Look mama  
I love you  
Look mama look  
Look mama look.  
  
I gotta make my own mistakes  
  
Why can't you treat me like a friend?  
Look mama  
I love you  
But you gotta let me live my life. .. .  
Look mama  
I love you  
Look mama look  
  
Look mama look  
Look mama look.  
Look mama  
I love you  
Look mama look  
  
Look mama look  
Look mama look.

We stay up late  
We get no sleep  
My body's aching  
I got no money left  
My friends say I'm loosing it  
You so bad for me  
But that's a good thing  
Love is a good thing  
  
Every room we're in  
Gets trashed from floor to ceiling  
Your kiss is killing me  
When I part from your sweet lips  
My dreams of you are censored  
Restless end in sight  
But that's a good thing  
Love is a good thing  
Love is a good thing  
Love is a good thing  
  
The first law of love  
Is all the rules could be re written  
The second law of love  
Is just what we make it  
No question  
That's a good thing  
Love's a good thing  
  
The first law of love  
Is all the rules could be re written  
The second law of love  
Is just what we make it  
No question  
That's a good thing  
Love's a good thing  
  
The first law of love  
Is all the rules could be re written  
The second law of love  
Is just what we make it  
No question  
That's a good thing  
Love's a good thing

Everything around is natural don't fight it  
Don't disagree with this and that, no  
Astrology, evolution, this-and-that-ity  
This religion and that, no  
  
Chorus  
And if they were not meant to be  
Well don't you think they wouldn't be  
And if they were not meant to be  
Well don't you think they wouldn't be, oh  
  
Your beliefs, philosophy, don't give us peace  
Destruction of our enemy does it make us right  
And if you took them apart and destroyed them all now one by one  
This still won't make it work, no  
  
Everything we like and don't like is whole and natural  
I know is doesn't feel like it and the world seems wrong  
But if we don't like it now then who can we blame  
Blame god, be still, find harmony

I've been waiting for so long  
To come here now and sing this song  
Don't be fooled by what you see  
Don't be fooled by what you hear  
  
This is a song to all my friends  
They take the challenge to their hearts  
Challenging preconceived ideas  
Saying goodbye to long standing fears  
  
Don't crack up, bend your brain, see both sides  
Throw off your mental chains  
  
I don't want to be hip and cool  
I don't want to play by the rules  
Not under the thumb of the cynical few  
Or laden down by the doom crew

Bring me down to earth  
Take this weight from tired shoulders  
Kiss me tenderly  
Let me drown in waves of your love  
You part the trees so I  
Can cherish things that matter  
Your single voice sounds through  
A room of din and chatter  
Oh take me home  
When the streetlights shine above  
Safe in your arms  
So simple to me  
Safe in your arms  
Oh so temporary  
Safe in you arms  
Oh so tenderly  
Not one of the lonely tonight  
Flying hectically  
Through a cloud of buts and maybes  
Passing frantically  
Over nights and days unended  
You turn my head and laugh  
When my world turns sour  
You give me strength to pass  
Through my darkest hour  
Oh take me home  
When the streetlights shine above  

What freezes love in your eyes  
What steals the force from your life  
What holds us ransom tonight  
What stops you seeing yourself?  
Only fear can stand  
On potential's hands  
This is the greatest day of your life  
If you make it  
And the old spells you know  
They can be broken  
Nothing to fear  
Nothing to fear  
The greatest faults can be beaten  
The grandest problems defeated  
Impossible choices completed  
Infinite pain will be treated  
Only fear can stand  
On potential's hands  
This is the greatest day of your life  
And we made it  
And the old spells you know  
'cause they can be broken  
Nothing to fear  
Nothing to fear  
This is the greatest day of your life  
And we've made it  
Break the old spells  
Oh, let them be broken  
Nothing to fear  
No, nothing to fear  
This is the greatest day  
Break the old spells and throw them away  
Break the old spells  
Don't why'know they can be broken  
No, nothing to fear  
Nothing to fear  
Nothing to fear  
Nothing to fear  

Give me one last try  
Hold on for me  
Believe my alibi  
Keep strong  
Don't set me free  
Well this weakness makes me wrong  
I'll show you I can be strong  
And this time it is for real  
I know the hurt I've made you feel  
But I won't let you down  
No one else would have me 'round  
You gave your love so honestly  
Is heaven's grace too good for me  
I know I've pushed my luck  
So many times  
I'm slippin' slowly now  
Loosin' track, of my mind  
Well this shadow I've become  
Will step out to meet the sun  
And this time it is for real  
I know the hurt I've made you feel  
But I won't let you down  
No one else would have me 'round  
You gave your love so honestly  
Is heaven's grace too good for me  
And when the darkness comes  
And I lose sight,  
Of the precious world  
That you put right  
You've the strength to pull me through  
One last try I'm asking you  
And this time it is for real  
I know the hurt I've made you feel  
But I won't let you down  
No one else would have me 'round  
You gave your love so honestly  
Is heaven's grace too good for me  

Flying through the airwaves  
Living through the printed word  
Flasher in the living room  
Guru of the seen and heard  
Who decides what we get to hear  
Fuzzy round the edges or making it clear  
Blinding us with those facts  
Chorus  
The power of the media will make up our minds  
The power of the media will take down our minds  
Written on the black and white page  
We can't believe what we read  
Tarting up reality has become the new rage  
Who said the truth is stranger than fiction  
A few white lies for a nice little sensation  
Buy up a paper you can influence the nation  
Little box in the corner  
A picture worth a thousand words  
But who chooses which pictures we see  
Who decides on the commentary  
Keeping people in a state of confusion  
There's a thin line between facts and illusion  
Diverting our attention from big brother in the city  
When will we get to the real nitty gritty  

You have been a healer, makin' me well  
You have been my talker, givin' my ego hell  
You came and settled me down, when my lights were so dim  
You made me go on when I felt like givin' in  
  
You have been my fire to warm this heart of stone  
You stopped me from feelin' lost and on my own  
You must have been through college, got a lovin' degree  
You ripped away my mental chains and set this poor boy free  
  
You are a powerhouse of energy  
You are a powerhouse of love  
Dealin' with what's right in front of you  
Your are a powerhouse of love  
  
When I was in pain, lyin' in my troubled bed  
You would be my jester, makin' me laugh instead  
You've been my guiding light and you have turned the switch on  
You made me see positive when my whole damn world went wrong  
  
You are a powerhouse of energy  
You are a powerhouse of love  
Dealin' with what's right in front of you  
You are a powerhouse of love

It's a frighten time  
For people round the world  
Feel uneasy now about the future  
Time to end the war against humanity  
Time to build the peace  
In our new century  
  
We're talking 'bout a revolution, an evolution of the heart  
  
The listening heart  
Opens up but won't surrender  
Just as you are  
To what you could be  
Opening Mind  
Reaching out for something better  
Changing my life  
A revolution of the heart  
  
There's a beating heart that beats in everyone  
Fills the universe without exception  
From a speck of dust to far off galaxies  
Right back down to Earth  
The heart of you and me  
  
We're talking 'bout a revolution, an evolution of the heart  
  
The listening heart  
Opens up but won't surrender  
Just as you are  
To what you can be  
  
Opening Mind  
Reaching out for something better  
Changing my life  
A revolution of the heart  
  
We're talking 'bout a revolution, an evolution of the heart  
  
The listening heart  
Opens up but won't surrender  
Just as you are  
To what you can be  
  
Opening Mind  
Reaching out for something better  
Changing my life  
A revolution of the heart

A fella told me  
This here road leads to Cairo  
I got to get me a ride  
I got to go back  
Go back to my children  
I got to see my little bride  
  
I been travellin'  
Gone a long long time  
Don't know what I'll find  
Scared of what I'll find  
But I just got to see them again  
  
Hey thanks for stoppin'  
Are you headed down to Cairo?  
I wrecked my Lincoln in Saint Jo  
Why to little old Cairo?  
No special reason  
Look up some folks I used to know  
  
Me I travel some  
Have my share of fun  
Now that's a life a man can live  
Sure I've played and lost  
But who minds the cost  
You got to take more than you give  
  
Hey you got another cigar?  
Son I sure like this car  
Oh from your daddy as a gift  
Say on second thought  
There's gifts I haven't bought  
Just drop me here  
Thanks for the lift  
  
Yes I've travelled some  
Yes I've been a bum  
Never have a dime for gin  
Left to make my way  
Told her I can't stay  
To see my children poor as sin  
  
I know this road  
It leads straight into Cairo  
Twenty-two miles straight ahead  
I can't I can't walk down this road to Cairo  
They're better thinkin' I'm dead  
  
I been travellin'  
Gone a long long time  
Don't know what I'd find  
Scared of what I'd find  
I can't I just can't walk down this road

Will the moon keep shining on  
Can you stop the world from turning  
Stop running away from things that might fail you  
You have what you need you are the one  
You can't hold a person down  
'cause the truth will find it's opening  
You must take it on the things you must feel  
We all feel the same you are the one  
Chorus  
Roll right up and feel it see the world  
Prison doors are open wide  
See the world you need it  
You were born with something special  
You were forged in open fire  
Stop running away form things that might fail you  
You have what you need you are the one  

We got the same beat runnin' round  
Through this crazy town  
Oh I'm sick and I can't hear it anymore  
And when we touched as the blood and the rain  
We'd be shakin' the ground  
She's sick and there's a way to bring her 'round  
  
Show me what you're waitin' for  
This moment may not rise again  
And your heart will never know  
Show me what you're waitin' for  
The voices may not rise again  
And the world will never know  
  
The party drags us over the edge to a poison shore  
I can't carry this desire anymore  
Across the blue sky callin' me with the sweetest demand  
She talks to me of mercy make me understand  
  
Show me what you're waitin' for  
This moment may not rise again  
And your heart will never know  
Show me what you're waitin' for  
The voices may not rise again  
And the world will never know  
  
And through these years  
As the tears chase the rain  
The picture has cleared  
Can we face the change  
  
Show me what you're waitin' for  
The voices may not rise again  
And the world will never know  
Show me what you're waitin' for  
This moment may not rise again  
And your heart will never know

Step into these shoes feel this heart  
Step into these shoes they might fit you  
See through these eyes might be the same view  
If I'd lived through the same things as you  
I'd share the laughs, and cry the tears that you do  
Chorus  
Step into these shoes and feel this heart  
Step into these shoes no reason to fight  
Look into m mind it might fit you  
Act out this part is it so different to you  
Even if we don't ever agree  
The only difference is cosmetically  
Step into these shoes no reason to fight  
Step in step into these shoes and feel this heart  
Just feel my heart it beats with you  
We float downstream in the same canoe  
You might find the ocean faster than me  
But I'll see it eventually  
Step into these shoes and feel this heart  
Step into these shoes no reason to fight  
Step into these shoes and feel this heart  
Oh feel this heart please feel it  
Step into these shoes and feel this heart oh feel  
This heart please feel it  
Step into these shoes and feel this heart  
Step in step into these shoes no reason to fight  
Step in step into these shoes and feel this heart  
Step in step into these shoes no reason to fight anymore  
Feel this heart oh feel it  
Step in step into these shoes no reason to fight  

The time has come to watch you go watch you go  
We weathered rough storms together  
Couldn't conceive of the end  
When I heard of your leavin'  
It came as a shock and surprise  
Like the deepest kinds of love  
Lost on the inside  
Locked right on the inside  
  
What is the greatest expression of love,  
To let go and wish well  
But all these finer feelings  
have left me with tears to tell  
  
I couldn't be the one to hold you stop you go  
It is like stripping the soul  
Letting all the finest pieces go  
You know these feelings between us  
Could not be expressed  
You will never know my old secrets  
They are so deeply felt they are so deeply felt  
  
What is the greatest expression of love  
To let go and wish well  
But all these finer feelings have left me  
What is the greatest expression of love,  
To let go and wish well  
But all these finer feelings  
have left me with tears to tell  
  
Leaving me with my anecdoted and private jokes  
The memory of a friend  
You don't seem to know my old secrets  
They are so deeply felt they are so deeply felt  
  
What is the greatest expression of love  
To let go and wish well  
But all these finer feelings have left me  
What is the greatest expression of love  
To let go and wish well  
But all these finer feelings  
have left me with tears to tell  
But all these finer feelings  
have left me with tears to tell

Price of your love's too much to pay  
I'll save myself for another day  
You want my love but you don't want me  
You sell your goods with no guarantee  
You're taxing me at your highest rate  
You want my heart served on a plate  
The balance of love is in the red  
There's more to me than this double bed  
  
The balance of love is now in the red  
I'm fed up of empty promises  
I won't let the grass grow under my feet  
I've done my best to make our song complete  
  
Your interest rate is much too low  
You think that I've no life of my own  
The days have gone for your macho values  
I won't be walking in your shadows  
You're taxing me at your highest rate  
You want my heart served on a plate  
The balance of love is in the red  
There's more to me than this double bed  
  
Plenty of fish are left in the sea  
I seem to have picked a shark for me  
The balance of love is now in the red  
I'm fed up with the empty things you said  
  
It's as if you've never heard of give and take  
Must stop messing up me life make no mistake  
It's as if you've never heard of give and take  
  
Make no mistake  
Give and take  
  
Price of your kiss too much to pay  
I'll save myself for another day  
You want my love but you don't want me  
You say it's a gift but it's just a loan  
You thing that I've no life of my own  
The balance of love is in the red  
  
Plenty of fish are left in the sea  
I seem to have picked a shark for me  
The balance of love is now in the red  
I'm fed up with the empty things you said  
  
It's as if you've never heard of give and take  
Must stop messing up my life make no mistake  
It's as if you've never heard of give and take

This time, it's different  
Be sure, I mean it  
Can't go on trading on ideas that I just don't own  
A life with some meaning, a life with some sense  
I want, to blame you  
Give you, my power  
I keep it all on the inside, keep it locked in the dark  
I keep it all on the inside, keep it locked in the dark  
People telling me it's not my responsibility  
But it is my problem and it's my life, my life  
I must believe the solutions, to the problems, are in my hands  
  
Feel the presence of other  
Love the resistance it presents  
Different from and outside of me  
Pushing me to find what is self  
  
Slow down, just talk  
Sit down, right here  
Must be an answer to the question of birth and death  
A world with some meaning  
A world with some peace  
Inside, it's turbulent, outside, reflects it  
Hear you knockin' on the inside  
Hear me breathe answer please  
Hear you knockin' on the inside  
Hear you breathe answer me  
People telling me what they think that I should be  
Only thing that I can be is myself, myself  
I must believe in my choices to create value out of everything  
  
Feel the presence of other  
Love the resistance it presents  
Different from and outside of me  
Pushing me to find what is self  
Feel the presence of other  
Love the resistance it offers  
Different from and outside of me  
Pushing me to find what is self  
  
This time, it's different  
I'm sure I mean it  
Slow down, just listen  
It's my life, it's my life

It's been so long since I slept  
The good book at bedtime no longer suffices  
The bottle of whiskey just one of my vices  
It might help me to sleep  
There you are with your golden brown skin  
The sparkling pacifico catching your chin  
The salt on your marguerita will stick to your lips  
Lips that I'd die for a fleeting stolen kiss  
  
My mind wanders to you and things that we might do  
But you're just another illusion  
My mind wanders to you  
  
You couldn't live with someone in dreamland  
Toothpaste from harrods when the corner shop will do  
A friend giving a lift becomes a chauffeur for two  
The grandest illusions to hang on to  
There you are with your golden brown skin  
The sparkling pacifico catching your chin  
The salt on your marguerita will stick to your lips  
Lips that I'd die for a fleeting stolen kiss  
  
My mind wanders to you and things that we might do  
But you're just another illusion  
My mind wanders to you  
Wanders to you and the things that we might do  
But you're just another illusion  
My mind wanders to you  
  
(come with me)  
(wander with me)  
  
There you are with your london grey skin  
The light from the streetlamp corrupting your chin  
The cream from a guinness lingers on your lips  
Lips that would beg for a meaningful kiss  
  
My mind wanders to you and all that we might do  
But you're just another illusion  
My mind wanders to you  
Wanders to you and all that we might do  
But you're just another illusion  
My mind wanders to you  
Wanders to you  
Wanders to you

Questions on how you'd like to meet Jesus  
Or how you'd like to live with him  
Some people follow gurus  
Search truth and knowledge  
Some people don't want any religion in their life  
They just want to feel ok  
  
So far history is full of great people  
Who like to see peace in the world  
Who like to see peace in the world  
So far history is full of great people  
Who like to see peace in the world  
Who like to see peace in the world  
  
Some people want to get on the council  
Improve the environment  
Some people want be members of parliament  
And improve the country  
Some people want be anarchists  
And improve the whole world, Oh ohh ohh  
  
So far history is full of great people  
Who like to see peace in this world  
Who like to see peace in this world  
So far history is full of great people  
Who like to see peace in the world  
Who like to see peace in the world  
  
But there isn't any peace, anywhere, really  
Everyone and everything is in a hopeless mess  
Arguing and fighting  
Everyone and everything is in a hopeless mess  
Arguing and fighting  
So what can we do about it  
  
How about doing more listening than talking  
Giving everyone the benefit of the doubt  
People say give and take  
Why can't we give and give  
People say give and take  
Why can't we give and give  
  
This isn't exactly going to bring about peace in the world  
But it's something  
But it's something  
And we will probably still have a bad time  
What Can I Say?  
What Can I Say?  
What Can I Say?  
What Can I Say?

I love you whether or not you love me  
I love you even if you think that I don't  
Sometimes I find you doubt my love for you, but I don't mind  
Why should I mind, why should I mind  
  
What is Love anyway, does anybody love anybody anyway  
What is Love anyway, does anybody love anybody anyway  
  
Can anybody love anyone so much that they will never fear  
Never worry never be sad  
The answer is they cannot love this much nobody can  
This is why I don't mind you doubting  
  
And maybe love is letting people be just what they want to be  
The door always must be left unlocked  
To love when circumstance may lead someone away from you  
And not to spend the time just doubting

Restraints were hoisted on at such an early age  
Straps were tightened in the class  
Scripts by the school sage  
Putting out the spark  
Left us in the dark  
  
Possibilities shut right down  
The cleaver of the uniform was handed down  
Treated like a clown  
  
Where are we going  
Where are we going  
What are we doing  
What are we doing  
Throwing it away like that  
What are you doing  
Throwing is away  
All that potential  
All that potential  
Trickling away like that  
  
We will refuse to be your clones or  
Work in someone's scheme  
Let a person find themselves not be part  
Of a machine that worships power and wealth  
We need our sanity  
A day will come when everyone will have  
Their due respect  
Hate will no longer be a twisted form of love  
  
Where are we going  
What are we doing  
Throwing it away like that  
What are you doing  
All that potential  
Trickling away like that  
  
Tell me where are we going  
What are we doing  
Throwing it away like that  
What are you doing  
All that potential  
Trickling away like that

And they made the secret pact  
His knowledge would be tapped  
The link was based on a respect  
On their lives they would reflect  
A perfect state of non-attachment  
Was striven for and claimed as fact  
The younger grew and learnt his lesson well  
All his ideals were intact  
Why look for the key in another  
The answer lay in his own heart  
Won't find yourself in some other  
It always was there right at the start  
But power it corrupted  
That's where attachment starts  
The power had erupted  
The spell will crack  
As each mental bond was broken  
Strength grew in the young man's heart  
What began as love not passion  
Had left a seed in his heart  
Why look for the key in another ...  

Can't tell you how many times I've wanted to hold you  
Can't tell you how many dreams how many fantasies  
As I count down the hours and I count down the seconds  
Will I be able to say will I be able to say  
You are beautiful to me  
You are sexual to me  
Still a mystery  
You are woman  
Sometimes I wonder if this love will ever find expression  
Does a seed in winters arms know of springs intention  
Two spirits dancing through a body conversation  
Is this light years away will I be able to say  
You are beautiful to me  
You are sexual to me  
Still a mystery  
You are woman  

You took the love I offered  
I tried the life that you lead  
The truth was told and forgiven  
You sold the strength that I need  
  
Now I can see that all you wanted  
Was someone you could hold a mirror to  
This mirror shattered into pieces  
You didn't want to really make things true  
  
And the blame that you offered  
Is something I didn't need  
When the truth beads were counted  
Is it you that I freed  
  
And I can say that it's all over  
And I can say that I don't want it too  
I found that when I'm in your presence  
That I could reach the highest side of you  
  
And you can say it's all over baby  
And you can say it's all over now  
  
One more chance is what I stopped saying  
A colder place to lay my head  
Now it's over and truth is bragging  
An empty heart and a single bed  
  
And I can say it's all over  
Well you can say that you don't want it too  
I found that now I've lost your presence  
Love doesn't always let you see right through  
  
And you can say it's all over baby  
And you can say it's all over now  
And you can say it's all over baby  
And you can say it's all over now

You got the socket and I got the plug  
I am the floor and you are the rug  
I got the rhythm you got the beat  
We feel it shake us from our souls to our feet  
And you know I Love you  
You know I Love you...don't you  
You got the metal and I got the die  
We make a structure that no one can deny  
I need you and you need me  
I need your honey like a flower needs a bee  
You know I Love you  
You know I Love you...don't you  
No one is an island on that you can depend  
A person on his own is a sinking ship  
It will be that way til the time will end  
Now don't you worry when things get tough  
We'll stick together through the smooth and the rough  
Your the steam engine and I am the tracks  
Roll over me I'll be rolling right back 'cause  
  
  

There were times when I thought there was nothin' in this world  
There was nothin' in this world for me  
Everywhere I looked there was trouble in my life  
Trouble far as I could see  
Hey there's a man doin' alright  
What's his philosophy?  
He come over here and whispered in my ear  
You're the Buddha, you're the Christ,  
You're the Mohammed, and the Mother Mary  
So who am I so nervous and shy  
To be brilliant and talented  
It's the light not the dark that frightens us most  
And the power lies in our head  
You playin' small doesn't help at all  
The world need the things you give  
Switch yourself on, turn the pressure on  
You're the Buddha, you're the Christ,  
You're the Mohammed, and the Mother Mary  
There are times when I think there's plenty in this world  
There's plenty in this world for me  
Anytime I see trouble in my life  
It becomes an opportunity  
Now there's a chance to make the world dance  
You do it unconsciously  
Help this Winter turn into Spring  
You're the Buddha, you're the Christ,  
You're the Mohammed, and the Mother Mary
