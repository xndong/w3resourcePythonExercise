Woo-woo  
Dear mummy, dear daddy,  
You had plans for me, I was your only son.  
And long before this baby boy could count to three,  
  
You knew just what he would become.  
  
Run along to school,  
No child of mine grows up a fool,  
Run along to school.  
  
When you tried to tell me what to do,  
I just shut my mouth and smiled at you,  
One thing that I know for sure  
  
Bad boys  
Stick together, never sad boys  
Good guys  
They made rules for fools, so get wise  
  
Dear Mummy, Dear Daddy,  
Now I'm nineteen as you see,  
I'm handsome, tall, and strong.  
So what the hell gives you the right to look at me,  
As if to say "Hell, what went wrong?"  
  
Where were you last night?  
You look as if you had a fight.  
Where were you last night?  
  
Well I think that you may just be right,  
But don't try to keep me in tonight,  
Because I'm big enough to break down the door.  
  
Bad boys  
Stick together, never Sad Boys  
Good guys  
They made rules for fools, so get wise  
  
Boys like you, are bad through and through.  
Still,  
Girls like me, always seem to be with you  
  
We can't help but worry,  
You're in such a hurry,  
Mixing with the wrong boys,  
Playing with the wrong toys.  
Easy girls,  
And late nights,  
Cigarettes, and love bites  
Why do you have to be so cruel?  
You're such a fool  
  
[Chorus: x2]

You ask too much of me  
You try my patience  
Your tongue, it's like a razor  
You choose your words like weapons  
Here we go, Battlestations  
  
I never have the guts to let you look inside  
I don't think you'd appreciate the things that I hide  
  
[Chorus]  
Monday was the worst day  
And Friday wasn't my day  
But Wednesday was the best day  
Because on Wednesday night we made love  
All I'm trying to give you is a good time honey  
Why d'ya have to keep on playing games with my head  
Used to be your baby when you had no money  
Now we spend more time in battle  
Than we ever do in bed  
(Than we ever do in bed)  
  
You don't know how much I hate that answer phone  
Are you standing there?  
But, you won't pick up the 'phone  
Why lie to my face?  
(When you can buy a tape machine to give me bullshit in your place)  
  
Today I did something I thought I'd never do  
I opened up your diary and read about you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Monday was the worst day  
Wednesday we made love  
And Friday, ooh but,  
Saturday, is today, is what I'm thinking of  
Come in baby, come in close  
(Take off your designer clothes)  
'cause you know what I'm thinking of  
Do you remember me, do you remember us,  
Do you remember love?  
  
All I'm trying to give you is a good time honey  
Why d'ya have to keep on playing games with my head  
Used to be your baby when you had no money  
Now we spend more time in battle  
Than we ever do in bed  
(Than we ever do in bed)  
  
La premiere fois tu m'as fait beaucoup rire  
Tu etais si mignon, et tu jouais do piano  
Maintenant, mon mellieur ami see'est l'argent  
Au revoir, cheri  
Au revoir, mon amour

Every day it seems my smile's a little harder  
And every day, I seem to laugh a little less  
Living this way, it seems my sky's a little darker  
You went away and left me lonely in success  
  
(Can't you see I'm falling apart) (Repeat)  
Can't you see what's happenin' to me  
  
Take this hand and show my fingers where my heart is  
Understand, you may just save me from despair  
Watch this man, you'll see he can't stop what he has started  
Take this hand, you'll see right now there's no-one there  
  
(Can't you see I'm falling apart)  
You laugh at me as I fall  
(Can't you see I'm falling apart)  
Just tell me, tell me, give me one good reason  
  
Armed with love, I could save my heart  
But on my own I just can't make it  
I'm too weak to fight, so take it  
Armed with love, I could save my heart  
But instead I watch you die  
  
Armed with love, I could save my heart  
But on my own I just can't make it  
I'm too weak to fight, so take it  
Armed with love, I could save my heart  
Tell me why am I so blue.

I feel so unsure  
As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor  
As the music dies, something in your eyes  
Calls to mind the silver screen  
And all its sad good-byes  
  
I'm never gonna dance again  
Guilty feet have got no rhythm  
Though it's easy to pretend  
I know your not a fool  
  
Should've known better than to cheat a friend  
And waste the chance that I've been given  
So I'm never gonna dance again  
The way I danced with you  
  
Time can never mend  
The careless whispers of a good friend  
To the heart and mind  
Ignorance is kind  
There's no comfort in the truth  
Pain is all you'll find  
  
I'm never gonna dance again  
Guilty feet have got no rhythm  
Though it's easy to pretend  
I know your not a fool  
  
I should've known better than to cheat a friend  
And waste the chance that I've been given  
So I'm never gonna dance again  
The way I danced with you  
  
Never without your love  
  
Tonight the music seems so loud  
I wish that we could lose this crowd  
Maybe it's better this way  
We'd hurt each other with the things we'd want to say  
  
We could have been so good together  
We could have lived this dance forever  
But no one's gonna dance with me  
Please stay  
  
And I'm never gonna dance again  
Guilty feet have got no rhythm  
Though it's easy to pretend  
I know your not a fool  
  
Should've known better than to cheat a friend  
And waste the chance that I've been given  
So I'm never gonna dance again  
The way I danced with you  
  
(Now that you're gone) Now that you're gone  
(Now that you're gone) What I did's so wrong, so wrong  
That you had to leave me alone

Let me take you to the place  
Where membership's a smiling face,  
Brush shoulders with the stars.  
Where strangers take you by the hand,  
And welcome you to wonderland  
From beneath their panamas  
  
[Chorus]  
Club Tropicana, drinks are free,  
Fun and sunshine, there's enough for everyone.  
All that's missing is the sea,  
But don't worry, you can suntan!  
  
Castaways and Lovers meet,  
Then kiss in Tropicana's heat,  
Watch the waves break on the bay.  
Soft white sands, a blue lagoon,  
Cocktail time, a summer's tune,  
A whole night's holiday!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Pack your bags,  
And leave tonight.  
Don't take your time,  
Gotta move your feet, don't you miss the flight!  
Cool, cool, cool, cool  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Cool, cool, cool, cool

[Chorus]  
Come on, everybody!  
Get on, with your party!  
And don't let nobody say you're wrong.  
O.k.  
So you've lost control,  
But they'll never steal your soul  
No way!  
That they're gonna spoil your fun.  
  
Greedy men, in far off places,  
Don't be afraid to show your faces.  
We know what you've done is wrong,  
But clap your hands, and sing along now!  
Don't even bother, to let us know,  
When you flick the switch and stop the show,  
Because the party has begun,  
And we'll still be dancing, as-you-run-now!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh no, don't think that I'm not scared,  
Oh no, don't think that I'm prepared.  
I just take each day as it comes,  
Because it may, it may,,  
It may be the last one!  
I know they don't care about me,  
I ain't got no money, ain't a v.i.p.  
And I know they don't care about you,  
You may, as well, enjoy your life like I do!  
  
[Chorus]

You said that you loved me,  
And I thought that it was true.  
You said that you needed me,  
And baby I believed that too.  
  
I thought that you were shy,  
But you put me straight with a wink of your eye.  
I should've known better,  
Put my hands in my pockets every time I see you cry.  
  
People think you're just so sweet,  
But they don't know you quite like I do.  
I guess they think that I'm a lucky guy,  
But you're not fooling everybody.  
  
[Chorus]  
You can have my credit card baby,  
But keep your red hot fingers off of my heart lady.  
All I know is what I see,  
You're getting what you want and girl it ain't just me.  
No matter how you cry,  
I'm not giving any love away...  
Do you think I'm crazy?  
All I know is what I see,  
And what can I do  
When you pretend that you're in love with me baby?  
  
Don't say that you love me,  
Because I know that it's not true.  
Just tell me you need my money,  
Girl you know I'll give it to you.  
  
Between the ocean and the sky  
There are things that you can't buy.  
And if you look you'll see  
One of them is me.  
Take you hands out of my pockets  
Digging till the day you die.  
  
People think you're just so sweet,  
But they don't know you quite like I do.  
I guess they think that I'm a lucky guy,  
But you're not fooling anybody.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
These are the things that you've made for yourself,  
You've gotta take your opportunities or stay on the shelf.  
You've gotta stay  
Oh yeah,  
Well, that's OK  
It's just a game that we play.  
  
No matter how you cry,  
I'm not giving any love away.  
Do you think I'm crazy?  
All I know is what I see,  
And what can I do  
When you pretend that you're in love with me baby?

Everyday I hear a different story,  
People saying that you're no good for me,  
"Saw your lover with another and she's making a fool of you"  
  
If you loved me baby you'd deny it,  
But you laugh and tell me I should try it,  
Tell me I'm a baby, and I don't understand  
  
But you know that I'll forgive you,  
Just this once, twice, forever,  
'Cause baby, you could drag me to hell and back,  
Just as long as we're together.  
And you do  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't want your freedom,  
I don't want to play around,  
I don't want nobody baby,  
Part time love just brings me down.  
I don't want your freedom,  
Girl, all I want right now is you.  
  
Like a prisoner who has his own key  
But I can't escape until you love me  
I just go from day to day knowing all about the other boys  
You take my hand and tell me I'm a fool to give you all that I do  
I bet you someday baby someone says the same to you  
But you know that I'll forgive you  
Just this once twice forever  
'cause baby, you could drag me to hell and back  
Just as long as we're together  
And you do  
  
[Chorus]

Call me good  
Call me bad  
Call me anything you want to baby  
But I know that you're sad  
And I know I'll make you happy  
With the one thing that you never had  
  
Baby, I'm your man (don't you know that?)  
Baby, I'm your man  
You bet!  
If you're gonna do it, do it right, right?  
Do it with me  
  
So good  
You're divine  
Want to take you, want to make you  
But they tell me it's a crime!  
Everybody knows where the good people go  
But where we're going baby  
Ain't no such word as no!  
  
Baby, I'm your man (don't you know who I am?)  
Baby, I'm your man  
You bet!  
If you're gonna do it, do it right, right?  
Do it with me  
Come on baby, (ooh, take me home  
Please don't leave me here, to do it on my own)  
  
First class information  
I'll be your sexual inspiration  
And with some stimulation  
We can do it right  
  
So why waste time  
With the other guys?  
When you can have mine  
I ain't askin' for no sacrifice  
Baby your friends do not need to know!  
I've got a real nice place to go  
  
Listen,  
I don't need you to care  
I don't need you to understand  
All I want is for you to be there  
And when I'm turned on  
If you want me  
I'm your man!  
  
If you're gonna do it, do it right, right?  
Do it with me  
  
Now listen  
If you're gonna do it, you know what I say?  
If you're gonna do it don't throw it away  
Don't throw it baby  
Because  
I'll be your boy, I'll be your man  
I'll be the one who understands  
I'll be your first, I'll be your last  
I'll be the only one you ask  
I'll be your friend, I'll be your toy  
I'll be the one who brings you joy  
I'll be your hope, I'll be your pearl  
I'll take you halfway 'round the world!  
I'll make you rich, I'll make you poor  
Just don't use the door  
  
Do it with me

Foreign skies  
Blinded me to empty charms.  
I crossed the ocean,  
Fell into your arms  
  
So sure, so wrong..  
You sang me a simple tune,  
I took if for a song.  
  
Say goodbye  
Don't tell me why you have to go  
Loving you was as good as gone  
As good as gone.  
  
I'd love to know you  
Really know you  
But you see, there's something you should know,  
I never really thought you'd go  
  
Because today,  
I would have sworn I heard you say  
"I love you"  
"I want you"  
"I need to be with you today"  
I saw something in your face  
  
Stay here beside me,  
I need your love to guide me  
Your love,  
But now it's gone away,  
You left me crying like a baby,  
Like a baby

[Chorus]  
I'm just a love machine  
And I won't work for nobody but you,  
I'm just a love machine,  
A huggin', kissin' fiend.  
  
I think it's high time you knew,  
Whenever I think of you,  
My mind blows a fuse.  
When I look in you eyes,  
My meter starts to rise, and I become confused.  
My voltage regulator cools,  
When I'm sitting next to you,  
Electricity starts to flow,  
And my indicator starts to glow, wo  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Na, na na na na, na na na na, woo-woo-wooo  
Na, na na na na, na na na na, na naaah  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm gentle as a lamb,  
I'm not that hard to program,  
There's no way that you can lose,  
My chassis fits like a glove,  
I've got a button for love,  
That you have got-to-use.  
If you look into my file,  
I am sure you can find out how,  
To turn me on just set my dial,  
And let me love you for a little while, ooh  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Na, na na na na, na na na na, woo-woo-wo  
Na, na na na na, na na na na, na naaah  
  
I'm just a love machine  
And I won't work for nobody but you.  
I'm just a love machine  
A huggin' kissin' fiend.

Move it move it, baby  
Can't you see I'm ready to dance?  
And I can't stop this rhythm in my heart.  
Move it move it baby,  
Can't you see I'm ready to dance?  
Without this beat my life would fall apart.  
  
Shuffle on your feet till the floor is hot,  
Gonna make a lot of money,  
Gonna break your heart.  
Watch out boy, (watch out boy)  
Shuffle on your feet till the floor is hot,  
Gonna make a lot of money,  
Gonna break your heart.  
  
But I'm the only one with a key.  
And that's me.  
  
Sometimes,  
You wake up in the morning with the bass line,  
A Ray of Sunshine,  
Sometimes,  
You know today you're gonna have a good time,  
And you're ready to go.  
  
Move it move it baby  
Can't you see I'm ready to dance?  
And I can't keep my rhythm in my heart.  
Move it move it baby,  
Can't you see I'm ready to dance?  
Without this beat my life would fall apart.  
Shuffle to the beat,  
Gonna take a cut,  
There's money in your feet,  
Gimme what you got.  
  
Watch out boy, (watch out boy)  
Shuffle to the beat,  
Gonna take a cut,  
There's money in your feet,  
Gonna stitch you up.  
  
Any other boy that you see,  
But not me.  
  
Sometimes,  
You wake up in the morning with the bass line,  
A Ray of Sunshine,  
Sometimes,  
You know today you're gonna have a good time,  
And you're ready to go.  
  
Turn the music up,  
Turn the music up, turn it up,  
Because it's all I've-  
All that I've got.  
  
Shuffle to the beat  
Gonna take a cut,  
There's money in your feet,  
Gimme what you got.  
  
Watch out boy, (watch out boy)  
Shuffle to the beat,  
Gonna take a cut,  
There's money in your feet,  
Gonna stitch you up.  
  
Sometimes,  
You wake up in the morning with the bass line,  
A Ray of Sunshine,  
Sometimes,  
You know today you're gonna have a good time,  
And you're ready to go.

[Chorus:]  
Wham! bam!  
I am! a man!  
Job or no job,  
You can't tell me that I'm not.  
Do! you!  
Enjoy what you do?  
If not, just stop!  
Don't stay there and rot!  
  
You got soul...  
You got soul...  
I said get, get, get on down,  
Said get, get, get, on down.  
Hey everybody take a look at me,  
I've got street credibility,  
I may not have a job,  
But I have a good time,  
With the boys that I meet "down on the line"  
I said, I - don't - need - you  
So you don't approve,  
Well who asked you to?  
Hey - jerk - you - work  
This boy's got better things to do  
Hell,  
I ain't never gonna work, get down in the dirt,  
I choose, to cruise.  
Gonna live my life, sharp as a knife,  
I've found my groove and I just can't lose.  
A.1. style from head to toe,  
Cool cat flash gonna let you know,  
I'm a soul boy - I'm a dole boy,  
Take pleasure in leisure, I believe in joy!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Party nights, and neon lights,  
We hit the floors, we hit the heights.  
Dancing shoes, and pretty girls.  
Boys in leather kiss girls in pearls!  
Hot-damn! everybody, let's play!  
So they promised you a good job - no way!  
  
One, two, three, rap!  
C'mon everybody, don't need this crap!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If you're a pub man  
Or a club man  
Maybe a jet black guy with a hip hi-fi  
A white cool cat with a trilby hat  
Maybe leather and studs is where you're at  
Make the most of every day  
Don't let hard times stand in your way  
Give a wham give a bam but don't give a damn  
'Cause the benefit gang are gonna pay!  
  
Now reach up high and touch your soul,  
The boys from wham! will help you reach that goal.  
It's gonna break your mama's heart, (so sad)  
It's gonna break your daddy's heart, (too bad)  
But you'll throw the dice and take my advice,  
Because I know that you're smart.  
Can you dig this thing? - yeah!  
Are you gonna get down? - yeah!  
Say wham! - wham!  
Say bam! - bam!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Do you want to work? - no  
Are you gonna have fun? - yeah  
Said one, two, three, rap, c'mon everybody,  
Don't need this crap!  
Enjoy what you do?  
Everybody say wham! - wham!  
Everybody say wham! bam! - wham! bam!  
Enjoy what you do?

Just throw the dice and take

I spend my nights down on the wharf  
In unlit alleyways  
By the church downtown  
Where Sally prays  
Come down sometime  
We'll share a rusty can of corn  
And listen to the radio  
I love you, I love you, it says  
  
[Chorus]  
Where did your heart go  
Did you put it on a train  
Did you leave it in the rain  
Or down in Mexico  
  
You cry, but I don't know  
I've heard it all before  
There it goes again, the slamming of the door  
Sometimes the river calls me  
And at night it calls my name  
Says "put your troubles down beside me"  
Things have always been the same  
And rock 'n' roll won't teach me  
What the river said that night  
I jumped into this beauty  
And drifted out of sight  
  
[Chorus]
