It's a cinch to pass the time with you,  
But hard to pass the time alone,  
Can you take it?  
And it's true,  
  
True, the couple next to you  
Think you look strange.  
Alone, what are your aims,  
Or do you have any?  
  
Avoid confusion.  
You always know,  
Always know how much your paying.  
I concentrate on,  
  
On, what the people say,  
The couple next to me.  
Pass the salt, pour it in my wounds.  
It looks like you have no friends,  
  
Can't keep up with the new trends.  
Sorry, sorry, for myself I don't agree.  
No, I always go out eating with my best friends.  
It's less than normal.  
  
Avoid confusion.  
You always know,  
Always know how much your paying.  
I concentrate on,  
  
On, what the people say,  
The couple next to me.  
Avoid confusion.  
You always know,  
  
Always know how much your paying.  
I concentrate on,  
On, what the people say.  
I think at times.

I am the son,  
And, the heir.  
Of a shyness that was criminally vulgar.  
Son, and heir.  
Of nothing in particular.  
Oh, shut your mouth.  
How can you say,  
I go about things the wrong way?  
I'm human and I need to be loved,  
Like everyone,  
Like everyone does.  
I am the son,  
And, the heir.  
Of a shyness that was criminally vulgar.  
Son, and heir.  
Of nothing in particular.  
Of nothing in particular at all.  
And you say it's gonna happen now.  
When exactly do you mean?  
I've already waited to long,  
And all my hope is gone.  
There's a club if you'd like to go.  
You might meet someone,  
Who really loves you.  
So you go on your own,  
And leave on your own,  
And you go home,  
And you cry and you wanna die

If, you turn, turn away,  
I, can pretend, that you'll stay.  
  
If you want it.  
If, you, want, I will.  
Torn, in two, torn away.  
I, could not look.  
I wish you did.  
  
If you want it.  
If, you, want, I will.  
If you really want it.  
If you really want to.  
  
All ways I want to burn,  
set, fire to,  
things that were not returned.  
So take what you can get,  
second chance might not come.  
Or we can just stay dumb.  
If really you want to.  
I, I will.  
If you really want to.  
  
If you turn, away.  
If you turn, turn away.  
  
If you want to.  
If you want to.  
If you want to.  
  
(Are we rolling?)  
  

Inequity solace, in your driven sate  
Seize your right to earn the same  
She wants it  
How long must we wait  
  
Before they take our side?  
Sordid practice, engine overheated  
There's no way to cool  
Turned up on your side  
  
The one that you choose  
Why should they mind  
Scared of what your thinking?  
A strong resistant  
  
Sunday feeling, under weight  
Of what's to come  
Tired of living under thumb  
She wonders, why did you say what you said.  
  
Silently living is death.  
Shout him down, it's worth it,  
No compromises on this.  
Turned up on your side,  
  
The one that you choose.  
Why should they mind,  
Scared of what your thinking.  
Scared of what your thinking.  
  
She wonders,  
How long, have we been senseless.  
So tired and pensive.  
Instead of stand up,  
  
Stand to the side.  
Feel a strong resistant.

I said,  
Why do I always have to spell it out for you?  
Our story is always changing.  
We change it to hide the pain.  
  
And when the truth rears,  
its ugly head, it's all too late.  
Too late for the omission,  
That you kept inside and wished it was you.  
  
Does it seem like the same man?  
Doesn't seem the same at all.  
I can feel myself fall, falling, down.  
You can wave goodbye to your bad side,  
  
And suppress the feelings that could hurt you mind.  
There is no need for lies if the news ain't breaking.  
Framework falling down on the downside,  
Built on a weak spot,  
  
Facts hiding in your mind,  
Wait until the bomb drops.  
We have more sense than lies.  
The story is in our eyes.  
  
Does it seem like the same man?  
Doesn't seem the same at all.  
I can feel myself fall,  
Falling, down on the downside,  
  
Built on a weak spot,  
Facts hiding in your mind,  
Wait until the bomb drops.  
It doesn't seem like the same man?  
  
Doesn't seem the same at all.  
I can feel myself fall, falling, down.

Waist down, deep tied, now it's chest high.  
Pressure pours down from the top down, all sides.  
Something seeps down inside,  
you can't suppress when it's your want.  
To revise, could have skipped the slide,  
But you did not try.  
Change it all when you get time.  
When your first try's not so bad.  
Change it all when you get time.  
Stay inside, it's as safe as you can get.  
Trust in sleep, your delivery from what your feeling,  
In the time, your awake.  
Try to fake out yourself,  
The second you get wind of,  
What went wrong this time.  
Could have skipped the slide, but you did not try.  
Change it all when you get time.  
When your first try's not so bad.  
Change it all when you get time.  
Stay inside, it's as safe as you can get.  
Safest from the life that you got.  
Try to catch yourself, you slipped, again.  
Try to catch yourself, you slipped, again.  
But don't let it keep you in.

Thorn in, my side.  
And you live just to pull me down.  
Rusted, nail I stepped on.  
This infection.  
  
Thorn in my side.  
You're full,  
I think so,  
of anger.  
You need to sit down,  
stay down.  
  
The things you, want but don't get.  
Is that fair, I don't think so.  
A sure thing, you can count, on.  
A big depression.  
  
A thorn in my side.  
You're full,  
I think so,  
of anger.  
You need to.  
  
Your praise, is two faced,  
And you're  
you're cut down,  
my friend.  
Cut Down.  
  
A thorn in my side, thorn in.  
A thorn in my side, thorn in.  

Give someone some piece of your mind.  
Shine it, shine what you've been assigned.  
Has your identity sold out?  
Sit in the back and make no sound,  
  
This earth will swallow you down.  
Honest it makes you sick.  
You don't act on what you think's right.  
Honestly want to kick down doors that keep you in.  
  
Let your hair down.  
Sometimes relax your stiff posture.  
Or so they say, all work no play make you dull.  
Chance to change the patterns we're born to.  
  
A fear of appearing too concerned,  
Try to speak, but the words just get stuck.  
Honest it makes you sick.  
You don't act on what you think's right.  
  
Honestly want to kick down doors that keep you in.  
Each time you get to raise your hand for changes You don't know your luck,  
So put yourself to use like,  
  
You were taught by, by your heroes.  
You speak your mind, that's something.  
You speak your mind, that's something.  
We don't get it too often.

Treating your days like a countdown.  
Seconds pass by, waiting just to blow up,  
And you get nothing done,  
And this is what you want.  
  
Lost touch and,  
You turn your back and your some friend.  
Sterile conversation,  
Learn to talk a good game.  
  
Talk your way out,  
It's a sure thing.  
Testing the ends of what they'll put up with.  
You got your chance to say what you wanted to.  
  
But you never do,  
Stand up to the ones that keep you down,  
Now you can see right through it all.  
Lost touch and,  
  
Tracing your steps you can't begin.  
You can't start,  
To say what your thinking and why not.  
Talk your way out,  
  
It's a sure thing.  
Testing the ends of what they'll put up with.  
Sticking it out 'til you can't get up.  
How many times have you been pacified?  
  
Accepting it when you're told, there's no way,  
Making sure there never will.  
Sticking it out 'til you can't get up.  
How many times have you been pacified?  
  
Accepting it when you're told, there's no way,  
Making sure there never will.  
Testing the ends of what they put up with.

To stand the test of time,  
To stand alone.  
To be without the glue,  
That keeps us glued together.  
  
And feeling so excrementable.  
It only goes to show you,  
How many ways you don't know you.  
When the bad sets in,  
  
I could use some sleep.  
Resting, falling,  
Falling deeper than deep.  
We miss the point to carry on,  
  
We miss the point.  
To carry on where.  
Things you love but did not get.  
And all the times you've been upset by,  
  
Unfulfilled dreams and visions,  
And the guilt for your wrong decisions.  
It's so hard to pry away.  
Pry out from under all the lies,  
  
And distractions of the world,  
You've seen what they can do,  
But you can't see your way out.  
We miss the point to carry on.  
  
All thing fall through.  
That how it feels, when you hear the sound of Disappointment.  
So unsatisfied,  
When the sight's set higher.  
  
Some can't achieve, don't believe,  
There is light at the end at all.  
There's no light.  
Time to reach out for what's real,  
  
It's easy to miss, insist,  
That you shouldn't always follow the first thing you feel.
