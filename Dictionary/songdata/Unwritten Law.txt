Life hurts so bad  
Don't want you sad  
Just look back to  
Good times we had  
I'd give my soul for you I know  
Want to hold you before I go  
Before I go  
  
I need you to know  
I'm still alive in you  
It's my time to go  
Don't stay up late  
I'm not afraid  
  
And I don't want your heart to break  
I know I've seen what's been unseen  
Live fast, die young  
It's part of me  
(It's my time now)  
Before I go  
  
(It's my time now)  
My soul is on it's way  
(It's my time now)  
I need you to know  
Before I go

My baby's got this set of jet black eyes  
I swear that girl's the devil in disguise  
  
I've been  
Let down  
Burned out  
So let me tell you what I'm talking about  
  
I've been  
Chastised  
Deprived  
She's got my skull filled with sentimental lies  
  
She's no good for me  
So I'm gonna set her free  
I'm gonna let you fly  
Bye bye so long my sweet baby  
  
Chorus:  
Me, my love  
Blame it on me  
Me, my love  
Say it was me now  
Me, my love  
Step back, don't jack me up now  
Please, my love  
Blame it on me  
  
My girl, she's got this jet black hair  
When she walks, heads stop, rotate and stare  
  
I've been  
Let down  
Locked out  
So let me tell you what she's all about  
  
There's  
Black lies  
Fake cries  
She's got this bag filled with sentimental lies  
  
She's no good for me  
So I'm gonna set her free  
I'm gonna let you fly  
Bye bye so long my sweet baby  
  
Chorus  
  
Hey I know I'm wrong  
So I'll go home  
Make me believe  
Believe don't tease me, please now  
  
Chrorus

Imagine  
The dreams we had since we were children  
Are real  
It's magick  
To see their minds filled with the music  
We feel  
Well here's your message from above  
And if you want to push come to shove  
Alright  
This ain't no lullaby  
We're right at home in the California sky  
  
Illusions  
Are taking part of the confusion  
In me  
Tomorrow  
There'll be no heroes left to follow  
You'll see  
Bright lights that flash across the sky  
May be the reason why we're all insane and I  
I don't want to get away and  
We're right at home in the California sky  
  
Live from the mansion on the hill  
Reminds me of the way we used to feel right  
Orion's aligned now  
Turn back the time  
The California sky

I watch you sleep  
you're everything I hoped for  
But never dreamed of finding  
I can't believe that all I've ever wanted  
Is lying here beside me  
Hold me now, there's a beacon  
And it shines in me like gold  
Tonight, for it cannot be  
Denied in me so  
Hold me now, I can see a new horizon  
In my soul  
So lose control  
  
Close your eyes and dream  
you're safe within my arms tonight  
And this love will last a lifetime  
Everything we need  
Is ours under the stars tonight  
Every wish is my command  
The words that lie behind your eyes  
Mean everything to me  
So I'll hold you while you  
Close your eyes and dream  
  
you're safe with me  
I'll chase away the nightmares  
I'll shield you 'til the storm  
Runs and you will see  
I'll always leave a light there  
To burn until the dawn comes  
  
Hold me now, there's a beacon  
And it shines in me like gold  
Tonight, for it cannot be  
Denied in me so  
Hold me now, I can see a new horizon  
In my soul  
I won't let go  
  
Close your eyes and dream  
you're safe within my arms tonight  
And this love will last a lifetime  
Everything we need  
Is ours under the stars tonight  
Every wish is my command  
The words that lie behind your eyes  
Mean everything to me  
So I'll hold you while you  
Close your eyes and dream

There was a time when men would prosper  
They saw a sign that would offer them the key  
Immortality  
The desert sand held a place of recourse  
Their motivation driven by a higher source  
A higher source  
  
They let them know there's something more  
The writings on the wall  
Tell us the story of it all  
It makes no sense  
  
Show me the key  
The coffin text  
The disbelievers came to conquer  
The secrets lost in a buried desert tomb  
They sealed the truth  
As evolution ate the pharaoh  
Silenced the voice that cured all our sorrow  
Oh, our sorrow  
  
Silenced the voice that let us know  
The writings on the wall  
Tell us the story of it all  
It makes no sense  
Show me the key  
The coffin text  
  
Fighting, learning, saving, burning  
Never knowing what is coming next  
Lying, stealing, never healing  
Safe to say we've all been hexed  
It's in the coffin text

I remember the way when we used to play  
All our troubles seemed so far away, yeah  
That was when I lived from day to day  
Do you remember the times  
When all on our minds  
Was having fun  
And catching a buzz  
That was life for you and for me  
  
[Chorus: ]  
Whoah, oh, oh I want it back  
Whoah oh oh I want it back, now  
I've got my life to live  
  
Looking back now at all of my friends  
And asking myself why these times had to end  
Well, I'm older now than I was then  
And it makes no sense to try and deny it  
There's no use to try and defy it  
That's the way life goes for you and for me  
  
[Chorus: ]  
  
Hey  
Whoah, oh, oh I want it back  
Whoah, oh, oh I want it back, now  
I've got my life to live  
Right now, right now, right now

I can feel the world upon my back  
I got sixteen people breathin down my neck  
And it's kinda hard to keep your head afloat  
When the rain won't stop and your face is soaked  
But I'm  
  
I'm alright alright  
I'm alright alright  
  
[Chorus:]  
So just hang on cause I  
I won't be long and  
Just sing that song to me  
It goes I'm in love with you  
In love with me  
  
And I can feel your breath upon my neck  
One last caress I'm a nervous wreck and it's  
Kinda hard to keep your head afloat  
When the rain won't stop and your face is soaked  
But I'm  
  
I'm alright alright  
I'm alright alright  
  
So just hang on cause I  
I won't be long and  
Just sing that song to me  
It goes I'm in love with you  
In love with me  
Yeah I'm in love with you in love with me  
  
I'm alright alright  
I'm alright alright  
  
So just hang on cause I  
I won't be long and  
Just sing that song to me  
It goes I'm in love with you  
In love with me  
Goes I'm in love with you in love with me  
Yeah I'm in love with you in love with me now  
Yeah I'm in love with you in love with me

I heard you were concerned with my life  
I heard you had a lot to say  
  
Motherfuckin', thanks for nothin'  
  
I'm gonna do it if it feels right  
I'm gonna do it anyway  
  
Motherfuckin', thanks for comin'  
  
Well I'm sayin'  
Don't sa I'm not all right  
I'm used and confused and  
I'm still puttin up a good fight  
I'm still puttin' up a good  
  
F.I.G.H.T., fight, fight, fight  
  
Everybody thinks they know my problems  
Everybody knows what's best for me  
  
Don't think that anyone can solve them  
Don't think there's anyone but me

Don't want to think about it anymore  
Lying curled and naked on the floor  
And I don't want to hear those words you say  
What were they anyway?  
  
[Chorus]  
Whoa-oh  
Whoa-oh  
So here I go  
(So here I go, so here I go)  
Whoa-oh  
Whoa-oh  
Geronimo  
  
Don't want to get up outta bed today  
It seems much harder than it was yesterday  
And I don't want to hear those words you say  
What were they anyway?  
What were they anyway?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Let's leave today  
And forget everything  
Can't really take this place  
So what you say?  
  
Let's leave it all behind  
And don't look back  
We won't rewind this time  
Let's get away  
  
[Chorus: x2]

Here's to the morning  
Think that I'm bored and crazy  
Yes I have been to get up when I give in  
I need my second wind and I just can't take it anymore  
I just can't take it when your lying on the floor  
  
Get up  
Get up  
Get up  
Get up  
Cause I'm bored  
Get up  
Get up  
Get up  
Get up  
Get up off the floor  
He gets the usual 1,2,3  
Oh la di da di da why'd you hit me  
Get up  
Cause I'm bored (ya)  
  
Come entertain ya  
So stupid its contagious  
Mess that I've been  
I get up when you get in  
It makes more sense to win  
  
I just can't fake it anymore  
I just can't it and I heard it all before  
  
Get up  
Get up  
Get up  
Get up  
Cause I'm bored  
Get up  
Get up  
Get up  
Get up  
Get up off the floor  
He gets the usual 1,2,3  
Oh la di da di da why'd you hit me  
Get up  
Cause I'm bored  
  
Oh don't be so dramatic  
I know you almost had it  
Whoa  
I tried to show you but you won't go down to her  
  
(get up, get up, get up, now)  
  
Get up off the floor  
  
Get up  
Get up  
Get up  
Get up  
Cause I'm bored  
Get up  
Get up  
Get up  
Get up  
Get up off the floor  
He gets the usual 1,2,3  
Oh la di da di da why'd you hit me  
Get up  
Get up  
Get up  
Get up  
Cause I'm bored (ya)  
  
(get up)

Well I'll see you around  
I don't want to stay and drown  
The drama got too thick  
Makes me sick  
And I don't want to talk about it  
I already thought about it  
Stripped down of my pride  
Well I shed them tears and dried these eyes  
  
It was fun at the start  
But maybe we're worlds apart  
Facing different ways  
Different plains  
And I don't want to drag it out and  
I just gotta get on out and  
Leave it all behind  
It's time so don't deny it  
  
I want to know  
Does it show on my face  
I'm sick of this place  
I want to move on  
Coz the feeling is gone yeah  
I want to see  
Is it me out the door  
I told you before  
I want to have fun and it's just begun  
  
I've seen the light  
Tried to talk about it  
If you were ever down for me  
Just stop  
And you'd see  
You know I'm right  
And it showed in your eyes  
What we had shared had run empty  
So let it be  
Let it be  
  
I want to know  
Does it show on my face  
I'm sick of this place  
I want to move on cause the feeling is gone yeah  
I want to see  
Is it me out the door  
I said it before  
I want to move on and it's just begun

I want  
I know  
I see just how you feel  
But baby  
You got a ticket to ride  
  
And if you want me  
Got's to let me know  
'cause it's so hard to let you go  
  
Well, I've been around this block  
Ten thousand times  
So just patch me  
Just one more time  
  
But if you want me  
Gots to let me know  
'cause it's so hard to let you go  
  
I've got one life to live in  
So won't you stop and listen?  
Can't keep my head from spinning all around you  
  
I want  
I know  
I've seen just how you been  
And your livin' and sinnin' starts runnin' thin  
  
But if you want me  
Got's to take it slow  
'cause it's so hard to let you go  
  
I've got one life to live in  
So won't you stop and listen?  
Can't keep my head from spinning all around you  
And if you see me slippin'  
Just keep my head from hittin'  
I'd stop the world from spinning all around you  
  
But I'm frustrated  
So frustrated  
Seems like I've been here before  
But I'm frustrated  
So frustrated, yeah  
Seems like I've been here before  
  
So as the story goes  
You know it well  
And motherfuckers  
It's one to tell  
  
But if you want me  
Got's to let me know  
'cause it's so hard to let you go

I got a cocaine woman and she's cookin' up a pound of pills  
Another ride to the station and you know I'm gonna pay the bills, lord  
I gotta go see my baby  
Gotta run run run  
The only girl I loved  
It'll be the last one  
I know I know  
She's hell on wheels  
I know how she feels boy  
  
I like the way that she moves when she moves me  
I like the way that she feels when she feels me  
She don't complain when I say that I'm leavin'  
I'm in love  
  
I got a cyclone woman she's cookin' up a pound of thrills  
Another night she's away couldn't take cause you know it kills  
I missed her for six days  
Can't wait to see that fine-lookin' woman motherfuckin' lyin' next to me  
She's hell on wheels  
I know how she feels boy  
  
I like the way that she moves when she moves me  
I like the way that she feels when she feels me  
She don't complain when I say that I'm leavin'  
I'm in love  
  
I spent a lifetime finding you  
Oh my love  
And I'd die a thousand times for you, my love  
  
Yeah gotta run run run  
Oh, she'll be the last one  
I know I know

Communication is where it breaks down  
Humiliation is all that's left now  
Apologetic you say you're sorry  
You're so pathetic you won't be bothering me  
Just like I told you before  
Don't want to see you knockin' at my door  
Don't wanna see you round here no more  
  
Give me a little respect  
Not long till someone breaks your neck  
You're just a wreck  
And nothing's gonna change  
Nothing's gonna change  
Not much that you can say and  
Everything you do is fucking lame  
  
Your misdirection is all you offered  
Co-operation is dead why bother  
You live your life in someone elses dream  
And you will find you've slid between the seams  
  
I thought I told you before  
Don't want to see you knockin' at my door  
Don't want to see you round here no more  
  
I think enough has been said  
Takes too much to get it through your head  
Might as well be dead  
And nothing's gonna change  
Nothing's gonna change  
Not much that you can say and  
Everything you do is fuckin' lame  
  
And you think something's wrong with me  
Or maybe you can't see what I can see  
I say there must be something wrong with you  
Or maybe you can't do what I can do  
I want to know what happened to you  
  
Give me a little respect  
Not long till someone breaks your neck  
You're just a wreck  
And nothing's gonna change  
Nothing's gonna change  
Not much that you can say and  
Everything you do is fucking lame  
Fucking lame  
Fucking lame  
It's all fucking lame

Shut down  
Fallin' over once again  
Dropped out  
Hand extended for a friend  
Looked up  
And there's you lookin' in  
And who cares  
Cause no ones lookin' anyway  
Impaired  
My vision lost it yesterday  
And that's fine  
Don't mind feelin' that way  
Just don't let me lie here by my self  
Let's go  
I know I'm faded  
Outta sight  
Tonight  
Just stay with me, I don't wanna go home  
Outta sight  
Tonight  
Just rescue me  
I don't wanna go  
Rewind and take me back to start again  
Ducked out cause paranoia's settin' in  
But I'm with you until the end  
  
One ride  
We'll drive around the parkin' lot  
No pride  
Cause I don't seem to care a lot  
No cash  
This change is all I got  
Just don't let me ride here by myself now  
Let's go  
I know I'm faded  
Outta sight  
  
Tonight  
Just stay with me, I don't wanna go home  
All right  
Tonight  
Just rescue me, I don't wanna go  
So set still  
One last thrill  
Just stay with me and we'll never go home  
Outta sight  
Tonight  
Just rescue me and we'll never go home  
Yeah we'll never go home Yeah  
I don't wanna go  
  
One more ride  
One time once again  
Just climb in  
I'm still climbing yeah  
One more ride  
One time once again  
Just climb in  
I'm still climbing  
Outta sight  
  
Tonight  
Just stay with me, I don't wanna go home  
All right  
Tonight  
Just rescue me, I don't wanna go  
So set still  
One last thrill  
Just stay with me and we'll never go home  
Outta sight  
Tonight  
So rescue me and we'll never go home

Am I the only one that feels alone?  
Though all is home  
Emotions flow  
  
Am I the only one that hears the tears  
Run down my face?  
Would anybody recognize at all?  
  
'cause I know  
I'm so slow  
But I'm trying  
And I'm still dying to know  
Say you won't leave for the rest of my  
  
Life's the only thing that deals the pain  
Like pouring rain now  
Breeding hate  
  
And I don't want to do no wrong  
My God, it's been so long  
Please comfort me before I go insane  
  
'cause I know  
I'm so slow  
But I'm trying  
And I'm still dying to know  
Say you won't leave for the rest of my life  
  
I know  
I'm so slow  
But I'm trying  
And I'm still dying to know  
Say you won't leave for the rest of my life  
  
The rest of my life  
Na na na na na na  
  
She said  
  
I'm slow  
But I'm trying  
And I'm still dying to know  
Say you won't leave for the rest of my  
I can't have you leave for the rest of my  
Say you won't leave for the rest of my life

Had a bad day, don't talk to me, gonna ride this out.  
My little black heart breaks apart, with your big mouth.  
I'm sick of my sickness. Don't touch me, you'll get this.  
I'm useless, lazy, perverted, and you hate me  
  
You can't save me, you can't change me.  
Well I'm waiting for my wake-up call, and everything, everything's my fault.  
  
Went to the doctor, and I asked her to make this stop.  
Got medication, a new addiction, fuckin' thanks a lot!  
Had to relapse, I'm outta rehab, ruins everything.  
So point your finger, at the singer, he's in the pharmacy.  
  
You can't save me, you can't change me.  
Well I'm waiting for my wake up call, and everything's my fault.  
You can't save me, you can't blame me.  
Well I'm waiting here to take a fall,  
And everything, and everything's my fault.  
  
And I'm a death threat, haven't slept yet,  
Baby why the wake up call?  
I'm a bad boy, tell the tabloids, everything's my fault!  
  
Whoa whoa yeah, write it write it!  
Whoa whoa everything's my fault, everything's my fault.  
  
I went to heaven, but couldn't get in, for what I have done.  
I said 'Please take me!', he said 'You're crazy, you had too much fun.'  
  
You can't save me, you can't change me.  
Well I'm waiting for my wake up call, and everything's my fault.  
You can't save me, you can't blame me.  
Well I'm waiting here to take a fall,  
And everything, and everything's my fault.

I'm seein' red  
Don't think you'll have to see my face again  
Don't have much time for sympathy  
Cause it never happened to me  
You're feelin' blue now  
I think you bit off more than you could chew  
And now it's time to make a choice  
And all I wanna hear is your  
  
So follow the leader down  
And swallow your pride and drown  
When there's no place left to go  
Maybe that's when you will know  
Follow the leader down  
And swallow your pride and drown  
When there's no place left to go  
Maybe that's when you will know  
  
And foolish lies  
Well can't you see I tried to compromise  
Cause what you say ain't always true  
And I can see the tears in your eyes  
And what you said now  
Can't stop the words from running through my head  
And what I'd do to get through to you  
But you'd only do it again  
  
So follow the leader down  
And swallow your pride and drown  
When there's no place left to go  
Maybe that's when you will know  
Follow the leader down  
And swallow your pride and drown  
When there's no place left to go  
Maybe that's when you will know  
  
Well I can confess, I don't know what to make from all this mess  
Don't have much time for sympathy  
But it never happened to me, you're feelin' down now  
I don't know where I'll be when you come around  
And now it's time to make a choice  
And all I wanna hear is your voice

Hey, pretty face I'll spin you outta control  
We're gonna dance, dance, dance 'til the end of the show  
  
We gotta move, baby, baby so come on let's go  
I gotta rock in my pocket, what you think that its for  
  
And we can drive little honey to the top of the hills  
I got the time and the money if your comin' with pills  
  
Lets go  
  
Yeah, are you lookin' for the long way home?  
Do you love me, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, are you you lookin' for the long way home?  
None above me, yeah yeah  
  
I hide away from the sunshine  
We keep goin' until the morning light  
I hide away from the sunshine  
And these are the good times yeah alright  
  
Slow dance, take a chance with me  
Dance with me, dance with me, go go  
  
So come on suga suga to the top of the ride  
We'll be alright, little momma, we're still up all night  
  
So take a chance, slow dance with me,  
Don't you know I got the plan, take my hand 'cause I'm ready to go  
  
Alright  
  
Slow dance, take a chance with me, take off your pants with me  
Dance with me, dance with me, go go

Sail with me across the sea  
So we could see what's goin' on  
Along the way, red stack the bong  
  
We'll make it tight alright  
We'll write the one that makes her cum  
That one that makes it so she can't sleep tonight  
  
So bombs away  
And as they say  
Here's to oblivion  
  
And cheers to you  
As well it's through  
Sound siren  
  
[Chorus]  
She's still cryin'  
It's over  
It's over  
Sound siren  
It's over  
It's over  
  
We'll have some fun  
Play with a loaded gun  
Try not and shoot and kill no one  
'cause I would feel like shit  
  
But in the same regard  
It's getting hard to deal with it  
And I'm sick of it  
And no place is too far  
  
So bombs away  
And as they say  
Here's to oblivion  
  
And cheers to you  
As well it's through  
Sound siren  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
So bombs away  
And as they say  
Well it's over now  
It's over now  
She's gone, yeah  
And he won't go away  
  
So sound siren  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
(S-s-s-sound siren)  
(S-s-s-sound siren)  
(S-s-s-sound siren)  
(S-s-s-sound siren)  
  
[Chorus: x2]

So I'm not good enough  
To hang with your friends  
You say it's a bluff but  
It's no lie  
You want to be cool  
And hang with both side  
But what would they say  
I'm the fool  
  
It's a superficial society  
And it's a bunch of bullshit can't you see  
Why won't you wake up to reality  
I guess backstabbing ain't the way of life for me  
  
Open your mind and close your eyes  
To the things that really persist  
It's not your hair or the things you wear that  
Make someone socially exist  
It's hard to find yourself sometimes  
Around people with a cool policy  
Why don't you let yourself unwind and  
Leave that lame society  
  
Superficial society  
Superficial society  
Superficial society  
Well it's all superficial to me  
Superficial society  
Superficial society

Let me paint you a picture or two  
Just tellin' ya what I'd like to do  
I'll get a 12-pack and sit on the beach  
And look at all the hookers that I'll never meet  
They're sayin'  
Look at me  
Look at me now  
Look at me  
Look at me  
  
Maybe I'll bleach my hair or grow it out long  
I'll buy a surfboard and lay out all day long  
Well I'm the mammoth for you to nurture  
And I just want you to think you'll be screwin' a surfer  
Loot at me  
Look at me  
Look at me  
Look at me

Time's rollin' forward  
I'm gettin' bored  
Layin' on my back  
I'm losin' track  
Shifting patterns  
And nothin' matters  
Cause there's no one here  
I've lost my fear  
  
Well I've got no place left to hide  
I'm runnin' out of time  
Moving slowly  
The walls are closing  
In on me  
I can not see  
Appearing fine, well  
That's all a lie  
Cause I'm not alright  
  
Extinct inside  
I'm runnin' out of time  
My mother says I'm fine  
A teenage suicide  
No place to hide  
Well I've got no place left to hide  
No place to hide  
Well I'm runnin' out of time  
No place to hide  
Ya, I've got no place left to hide  
No place to hide  
A teenage suicide

Ease Up a Little bit  
'Cause I want to want you  
If all of the moneys spent  
Well that's fine to got you  
  
By my side, let's go for a long ride  
In my car I'll drive you to my star  
Out in space won't matter where we are  
  
A celebration, about time  
A generation out of line, yea  
The revolution's in everyone  
Blame the gun  
  
Ease up a little bit  
'Cause I have to have you  
Drink up a little bit  
If your mine I'll find you

Can we talk about automatic satisfaction  
Sittin' back relaxin' floored  
What's wrong with kickin' it  
When you're bored and lit  
Lets smoke some cigarettes  
And catch up on the back porch  
Fire up another roach  
  
We don't need a rest this is just a test  
'cause we're alright, we're up all night  
To see the sun come up again now  
Just one more time no reason why  
To see the sun come up again.  
  
The more we try to change  
The more we stay the same  
We're caught up in the game and now  
Just like empty picture frames  
So now were to blame  
  
Said we were gettin' down, on henessey and fountain  
Smelled another mountain now  
If you ain't gettin' down, you'll come around  
And were alright, we're up all night  
To see the sun come up again now  
Just one more time, no reason why  
To see the sun come up again.  
  
So lets smoke some cigarettes  
And catch up on the back porch  
Fire up another roach  
  
We don't need a rest, it's just a test  
And as the world spins we'll watch it with a grin  
And look in as the day begins  
Well now it's on again, it's dawn again.  
Yeah! Yeah!  
And we're alright  
We're up all night  
  
To see the sun come up again now  
Just one more time, no reason why  
To see the sun come up again  
Yeah we're alright, yeah we're alright  
Yeah we're alright, up all night  
Yeah we're alright, yeah we're alright  
To see the sun come up again now!

You're the chemical I'm in trouble I've lost all control
