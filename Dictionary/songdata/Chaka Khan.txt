Could it be that he's interested  
Or am I just wanting it be so  
Do I dare speak to him  
Or should I let the moment go  
  
Forget this hunger inside  
Forget this hunger inside  
Should I let the feelin' flow  
Should I just let it flow  
Ain't nothin' but a maybe ?.  
Oh and baby, I sure would like to know  
  
Could it be he's just friendly  
And that's nothing to get excited about  
On the other hand he could be answering  
The good vibrations I'm sendin' out  
Well I just don't know  
What I really see in  
Should I make a move  
Or keep on daydreamin'  
Ain't nothin' but a maybe  
Oh and maybe baby, I sure would like to know  
  
Wanna know ?wanna know ?  
  
Could it be that he's interested  
Or should I let the moment go and  
  
Forget this hunger inside  
Forget this hunger inside  
Should I let the feelin' flow  
Should I just let it flow  
Ain't nothin' but a maybe ?.  
Oh and baby, I sure would like to know  
  
Repeat  
  
Forget this hunger inside  
Forget this hunger inside  
Should I let the feelin' flow  
Should I just let it flow  
Ain't nothin' but a maybe  
Ain't nothin' but a maybe

You do me wrong and still I'm crazy 'bout you  
Stay away too long and I can live without you  
Every chance you get you seem to hurt me more and more  
But each hurt makes my love stronger than before  
  
I know flower grow through rain  
But how can love grow through pain  
  
Ain't that peculiar  
Peculiarity  
Ain't that peculiar  
Peculiar as can be  
  
You tell me lies  
That you'll be honest to me  
But I'm so much in love with baby till I don't want to see  
Cause the things you do and say  
Are designed to make me blue  
It's a doggone shame my love for you  
Makes all your lies seem true  
  
If the truth makes love last longer  
Why do lies make my love stronger  
  
Ain't that peculiar  
Peculiarity  
Ain't that peculiar  
Peculiar as can be  
  
Hm, I act just like a child that's lost his toy  
Can't you see these tears I cry are tears of joy  
A child can cry so much until you do everything they say  
But unlike a child those tear don't help me to get my way  
  
I know love can last through years  
How can love last through tears  
  
Ain't that peculiar  
Peculiarity  
Ain't that peculiar  
Peculiar as can be  
  
Ain't that peculiar (ad lib to end)

Ooh ooh  
You're all alone  
Well, so am I  
We could dance all night  
Are you willing to try  
All night's all right  
If you're in no hurry -- well  
Neither am I  
Do you like to boogie  
Well just stop on by  
All night's all right  
All night's all right  
  
Ooh ooh  
Mama's away  
Daddy too  
Me and you all alone  
With nothing to do  
All night's all right  
We're taking it slow  
We're taking it fast  
Do you like tomorrow  
Make it last  
All night's all right  
All night's all right  
  
All night's all right  
All night's all right  
All night's all right

A long time ago in the 40's  
Dizzy and Bird gave us this song  
They called it "A Night In Tunisia"  
And the melody still lingers on  
  
It was new and very strange  
Blew the squares right off the stage  
Few could play along  
But the melody still lingers on  
  
Max and Miles to name just two  
Together they grew  
The music was young and strong  
And the melody still lingers on  
  
They paved the way for generations  
From Coltrane to Stevie  
No one could stop the winds of change  
Without them where'd we be?  
  
The Duke and the Prez were there before  
The past you can't ignore  
The torch is lit, we'll keep the flame  
And the melody remains the same  
  
In the 40's  
A night in Tunisia  
In the 40's  
A night in Tunisia  
In the 40's  
A night in Tunisia  
In the 40's  
A night in Tunisia

Troubled little angel  
Inconsistent flying blind most of the time  
Drama queen  
  
Preening and untangling  
Feathers in her wings  
Captured by her dreams  
Desperately she sings  
  
[Chorus]  
Needy little baby  
Open up your heart  
Don't you be afraid to feel  
Needy little baby  
Hiding' deep inside  
Don't you know your love can heal  
  
Troubled little angel  
Inconsistent  
Flying blind most of the time  
Don't know who to be (Yeah)  
Always rearranging the wreckage of her life  
Ever holding tight to the hope that she'll be free  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm talking to you angel  
Angel  
Deep inside of me  
I'm talking to you angel  
Angel  
One day you'll be free  
  
Angel (Angel)  
Angel (Angel)  
Deep inside of me (Inside, inside)  
Talking to you angel (Angel)  
Angle (Angel)  
You'll be free

You go out every night as a single  
But you don't really know what to do  
You see someone that you'd like to mingle  
And imagine that she is waiting for you  
  
Chorus:  
Any love that you feel  
Is real  
Any time that you use love  
You lose love  
  
There is no certain crowd that you run with  
But your passions they never run thin  
You say 'hi', they say 'hi' and it's done with  
Still you don't really love from deep within  
  
Chorus  
Batted eyes and bitter tears  
Price you pay for all the years  
Of holding back what's deep inside  
And living with a hell of a lot of lies  
  
Chorus

Spendin' all my time  
With you on my mind  
I think it's time that we made the score  
Oh it makes me crazy  
This anticipating  
Cause I'm loving you more and more  
  
One by one the lonely hours slip away  
I'd like to be your fun and games  
Brighten up your day, yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
[CHORUS:]  
Any old Sunday, any old Sunday will do (so what are you waiting for?)  
Any old Sunday, any old Sunday will do (so what are you waiting for?)  
  
I'm waitin' for the time  
To feel your arms around me (so what are you waiting for?)  
Time keeps passing  
I'm yours for the asking  
Because our love is an open door  
Stop cultivating, stop hesitating  
No more questions in my mind  
You can be so lovely  
Our love will be like honey to the bee  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

You said you won't  
I bet my neck, I bet you will  
I'm gonna check my love  
You I'm gonna thrill  
Can't imagine what you've missed  
Can't go on  
Meet me at midnight in the light that starts the love  
  
CHORUS:  
Since there's was you  
I changed my mind about it all  
Instead of goin' on  
I'm gonna settle for a fall  
My love, my love will lift you up, up, up  
  
You came into my life and now I realize  
Today we love, we might, but it is for sure at midnight  
  
CHORUS  
  
You came into my life and now I realize  
Today we love, we might, but it is for sure at midnight  
At midnight, at midnight, at midnight

Best in the west, that's your name  
Makin' love's your claim to fame  
Better than the best, oh everyone say  
How'd he learn to love that way  
You're the best in the west  
You're a tough sharp shooter  
And you aim to win  
And I wish you'd love me now  
Like you did then  
You're the best in the west  
You're the best I've ever had  
A naughty boy  
And the memory of you fills me with joy  
Let's do it again, let's do it again  
Best in the west, when you were five  
Kissed the girls and made them cry  
Better than the best, oh you built your place  
Lovin' is a symphony  
You're the best in the west  
You've been a ladies man with class  
Since way back when  
And you stand so high above all the men  
You're the best in the west  
And your lovin' seemed to fell me  
From the start  
And the fantasy of you is in my heart  
Let's do it again, let's do it again  
Let's do it again, (Ooh let's do it, baby)  
Let's do it again  
(The way you do it, baby's good to me yeah)  
Well I'm pretty damn good myself  
But I must confess  
When it comes to makin' love  
Baby, your the best in the west  
CHORUS:  
Best in the west, that's your name  
When you gonna love me again  
Let's do it again  
CHORUS  
Better than the best, everyone say  
How'd he learn to love that way  
Let's do it again  
CHORUS  
Better than the best and everyone say  
How'd he learn to love that way  
Best in the west, that's your name  
Makin' love's your claim to fame  
Let's do it again  
Better than the best and everyone say  
When you gonna love me again  
Let's do it again  
Better than the best and everyone say  
How'd he learn to love that way  
Let's do in again  

Hey, can you change your ways  
Our love is such a treasure  
Why do you run away  
From things that give you pleasure  
  
I love you all this time  
On and on I've tried to work it out for the right day  
In life you'll learn, you'll see  
From birth, we start to die  
Oh so fast, so near  
There's nothing to lose  
Nothing to fear  
  
So little time to try  
There's so much to know  
Then to see the pain it shows  
To get what you deserve  
To reap what you sow  
That's the way it goes  
  
Why can't you change your ways  
Why can't you change your ways  
Why can't you change your ways

Clouds  
Different shapes and sizes  
Hiding the horizon  
  
Clouds  
In the distance  
Coming to change my plans  
All my dreams will melt like sand  
  
Clouds  
The moment that you say good-bye  
They're going to rush right to the sky  
  
Whoa  
Baby, baby, please don't go  
  
It's going to rain  
It's going to rain  
It's going to rain down tears  
Of heartaches and fears  
  
It's going to rain  
It's going to rain  
I know for sure  
Cause you don't reach for me no more  
  
It's going to rain  
It's going to rain  
There in the distance  
Is that number one pain  
  
Clouds  
Thunder is the warning  
So dark and so alarming  
  
Clouds  
Go away, go away  
Go, don't take away my sunny days  
  
Clouds  
Leave me be  
Getting so dark out  
I just can't see

Dance wit me ev'rybody dance wit me  
Dance wit me ev'rybody dance wit me  
Dance wit me ev'rybody dance wit me  
Dance wit me ev'rybody dance wit me  
  
If you feel like dancing all night long  
Band goin strike it up and play you a party song  
If what you feel is real  
Then we gon' get down and groove  
Love the way you party  
Love the way you move  
  
Know the joint is jumping people bumpin away  
We got this groove and you know that it's here to stay  
So if you feel like dancin  
Put on your dancin shoes  
Love the way you party  
Love the way you move

In question is how all this came to be  
You and me, kinda free, it's destiny  
  
I look around and I like everything I see  
Just us three, kinda free, it's destiny  
  
Oh I'd like to know just what it is  
That makes some things the way they are  
Oh what sets the pace, what is that maze  
That gives me wings to fly  
  
Come on lets keep flying baby, sweet baby  
(I said) come on let's keep flying baby, sweet baby  
  
We found this place, an endless space  
Can't let go, no baby no, it's destiny  
  
Oh, by God's grace there's no other place for me to be  
No, don't you go, it's destiny  
  
Oh I'd like to know just what it is  
That makes some things the way they are  
Oh, what sets the stage, what is that face  
That gives me wings to fly

(Donald Black, John Barry)  
  
Diamonds are forever,  
They are all I need to please me,  
They can stimulate and tease me,  
They won't leave in the night,  
I've no fear that they might desert me.  
  
Diamonds are forever,  
Hold one up and then caress it,  
Touch it, stroke it and undress it,  
I can see ev'ry part,  
Nothing hides in the heart to hurt me.  
I don't need love,  
For what good will love do me?  
Diamonds never lie to me,  
For when love's gone,  
They'll lustre on.  
  
Diamonds are forever,  
Sparkling round my little finger.  
Unlike men, the diamonds linger

Said the little lamb  
To the shepherd boy  
Do you hear what I hear  
Ringing through the night  
Shepherd boy  
Do you hear what I hear  
A song, a song  
High above the trees  
With a voice  
As big as the sea  
With a voice  
As big as the sea  
  
Said the shepherd boy  
To the mighty king  
Do you know what I know  
In your palace warm  
Mighty king  
Do you know what I know  
A child  
A child shivers in the cold  
Let us bring him  
Silver and gold  
Let us bring him  
Silver and gold  
  
Said the king  
To the people everywhere  
Listen to what I say  
Pray for peace  
People everywhere  
Listen to what I say  
A child, a child  
Sleeping in the night  
He will bring us  
Goodness and light  
He will bring us  
Goodness and light

Chorus:  
Do you love what you feel  
Cause I love what you do to me  
Do you love what you feel  
Cause I love what you do to me  
  
Babe, when you're holdin' me  
Somehow you seem to set me free  
And when I dance with you, romance with you  
Is all I sing  
  
Chorus  
  
I've spent so many nights  
Just taking fights within myself  
Until you came to me  
And held me like nobody else  
  
Chorus  
  
Tell me 'bout the way you like it  
Anything you want is right  
You and I are close together  
Your lovin' gets me feeling better  
  
I wanna dance all  
I wanna dance all  
I wanna dance all night  
  
Everytime you're holdin' me  
  
Chorus

Build your dreams  
To the stars above  
But when you need someone true to love  
Don't go to strangers  
Darling, come home to me  
  
Play with fire till your fingers burn  
But when there's no place for you to turn  
Don't go to strangers  
Darling, come home to me  
  
For when you hear a call to follow your heart  
You'll follow your heart I know  
I've been through it all and I'm an old pro  
And I'll understand if you go  
  
So make your mark for your friends to see  
But when you need a little more than company  
Don't go to strangers  
Darling, come home to me  
  
(Piano solo)  
  
So? Make your mark for your friends to see  
But when you need more than company  
Don't go to strangers  
Darling, come home to me

Another time, you were the one in my life  
And this world of mine just turned around you  
Another time, you were the love of my life  
That was so long ago, now you're here  
And those feelings are starting to reappear  
Another time I would've run to you  
I finally learned that I could love somebody new  
And now I'm finally over you  
But don't look at me that way  
'Coz I'm trying to be strong  
And I'm begging you, baby  
Don't you look at me that way  
'Coz if you look at me now  
It just might be more that I can take  
Got someone, somebody new in my life  
I've got someone who cares about me  
And what we had is only what used to be  
I'm happy now, happy with someone else  
But when you're close  
I know the flame has never died  
And now it's burning me alive  
So don't look at me that way  
'Coz I'm trying to be strong  
And I'm begging you, baby  
Don't you look at me that way  
'Coz if you look at me now  
It just might be more that I can take  
I finally learned that I could love somebody new  
And now I'm finally over you  

Lil' darlin', gotta go now  
Don't know when I'll be coming back  
Got my future all planned out  
Got my bags packed  
Things don't always turn out right  
But that's just the way it goes  
Before I leave you there's just a few  
Things you should know  
Don't talk to strangers  
Don't forget to say your prayers at night  
Remember God, He made you  
And one day He'll make everything alright  
Don't cross on the yellow  
You always got to wait for a green light  
Remember God, He made you  
And one day He'll make everything alright  
Lil' darlin', gotta go now  
Don't worry, you'll be just fine  
When it comes to good luck  
I just know you'll always be first in line  
Nobody will ever love you  
As much as I do  
But that doesn't mean  
Other people won't love you, too  
Don't talk to strangers  
Don't forget to say your prayers at night  
Remember God, He made you  
And one day He'll make everything alright  

Sweet song singin' take me back (I wanna go)  
Sweet song singin' take me back (I wanna go)  
Sweet song singin' take me back (I wanna go)  
Sweet song singin' take me back (I wanna go)  
  
Here's to, to a long forgotten dream  
Enshrouded by, by a history so clean  
In a place still the same, so rich with time  
I remain in my heart, my soul, my mind  
  
So clear is the mystery to me  
So majestic, yet electric, dose of age I see  
There remains a sparkle in the sand  
Can't restrain these feelings of my ancient land  
  
Here is a melody for you  
Sky of white and nylon blue  
Let me hurry home to you  
To sing, to dance, to laugh  
  
Embrace  
So vague is this picture I am seeing  
Yet so clear, and so dear my soul is singin'  
To belong is this feelin' I am missin'  
  
To embrace this memory I been kissin'  
So clear is this mystery to me  
So majestic, yet electric, guest of age I see  
There remains a sparkle in the sand  
  
Can't restrain these feelings of my ancient land  
Here is a melody for you  
Sky of white and nylon blue  
Let me hurry home to you  
  
To sing, to dance, to laugh  
Embrace  
I wanna go  
Sweet song singin' take me back  
  
I wanna go  
Sweet song singin' take me back

Seems like an eternity since I've been in your arms  
A multitude of colorless hours pass  
I crave the life inside you, it keeps me from harm  
I only pray that it's not just another God  
  
Eternity, I want to be with you for all eternity  
Darling you be, the only one for me together for eternity  
  
I long to touch you (I long yo touch you)  
To feel the warmth in a world so cold  
Whenever we (ooh) -- I don't know  
But I want you all the time (I want to hold on)  
you are the beginning middle and end to every story told  
you are the science of my mind  
  
Eternity, I want to be with you for all eternity  
Darling you be, the only one for me together for eternity  
  
And it seems like a year away  
That you and I were making love  
One should take life from day to day  
But all my dreams are made of  
All my dreams are made of eternity

When I feel you dreaming  
I think of sunsets  
How high my high gets  
  
Chorus:  
I wanna give to you an everlasting love  
I fill your life with a satisfying love  
All you need is an everlasting love  
All you want is a satisfying (mystifying) love  
  
Sun breezes, moonlight teases  
Friendly invasion  
Late night persuasion  
  
Chorus  
  
Each time you pass me by  
You saw me fade away  
I'll give you more each day  
  

The minute you walked in the joint,  
I could see you were a man of distinction,  
A real big spender,  
Good looking, so refined.  
Say, wouldn't you like to know  
What's going on in my mind?  
So, let me get right to the point,  
I don't pop my cork for every guy I see.  
Hey, big spender, spend,  
A little time with, me, me, me!  
Do you wanna have fun?  
How's about a few laughs?  
I can show you a, good time,  
Do you wanna have fun, fun, fun?  
How's about a few laughs  
Laughs laughs  
(I can show you a good time)  
(Good time)  
(Good time)  
(Good time)  
  
What did you say you are?  
How's about a ,  
I could give you some,  
Are you ready for,  
How would you like a,  
Let me show you a, (good time)  
Hey, big spender,  
Hey, big spender,  
The minute you walked in the joint,  
I could see you were a man of distinction,  
A real big spender.  
Good looking, so refined.  
Say wouldn't you like to know  
What's going on in my mind?  
So, let me get right to the point,  
I don't pop my cork for every guy I see.  
Hey, big spender,  
Hey, big spender!  
Hey, big spender!  
Spend a little time with me!

I Up on the wire  
I like to climb and play with the sky  
The people far below  
The air is clear  
And I can perceive  
The whole world is shining  
Life is sublime  
And when you dare to go up in the air and leave the earth far behind you  
As I step and dip and leap into a space beyond  
Up high  
Just for a moment  
Alive  
And so afraid but alive  
As I push against the sky and my heart has broken free  
  
II Fear turns to joy  
When you can race the edge of the sky  
And life's intense and strong  
It's not so long  
Before you will run  
Beyond your horizons  
Up on the wire  
The line is thin and you must bow and surf against the sky so precisely  
But the sky seems to go on as far as you can see  
Up high  
Just for this moment  
Alive  
And so afraid but alive  
As the wire disappears  
And you've finally broken free  
  
Solo  
  
III As I step and dip and leap into a place beyond  
Up high  
Just for this moment  
  
Up on the wire  
I like to climb and play with the sky  
The people far below  
The air is clear  
And I can perceive  
The whole world is shining  
Life is sublime  
And when you dare to go up in the air and leave the earth so precisely  
As I step and dip and leap into a place beyond  
Up high  
Just for this moment  
Alive  
And so afraid but alive  
As I dip against the sky and my heart has broken free  
Broken free  
Broken free  
Up high

Chorus:  
Day to day  
You're the hi... Highlight  
Day to day  
You're the hi... Highlight  
  
You're the bright side of my darkness  
You remove my gloom  
You picked me up when times got rough  
I'm glad you had some room  
To love and hold me close to your heat  
To keep me safe and warm  
You're the height of my desire  
You set off my alarm  
  
Chorus  
  
I can't wait to see you  
From one moment to the next  
With you I never know what new thrill to expect  
Your perfect sense of timing  
Keeps me coming back for more  
You're the spark that lights my fire  
It's you that I adore  
  
Chorus

You gotta hold her now  
Never leave her  
Never let her go  
  
You think you lost her number but you've only lost a little bit of time  
She's waiting just to see you boy, a continental girl so fine  
Mirrors on the ceiling make it hard for you to sleep at night  
The opportunity is now  
You know you got to do what's right  
  
So, you take yourself down to her  
Before it gets too late  
There's no need to telephone  
Cause this can hardly wait  
The meaning of a moment has never been so strong  
A girl like this, a night like this  
It's right where you belong  
  
You gotta hold her now  
Never leave her  
Tell her how  
You're gonna love her, squeeze her  
Hold her now  
Never leave her again  
Never leave her again  
(Don"t you go)  
  
She found you in a restaurant when you were with another girl  
Remember?  
You tried to tell her how it was just to live in a harmless world  
Remember how she looked at you  
Remember how she stole your eyes  
And now you're all alone at night  
Runnin' out of alibis  
  
So, you take yourself down to her  
Before it gets too late  
There's no need to telephone  
Cause this can hardly wait  
The meaning of a moment has never been so strong  
A girl like this, a night like this  
It's right where you belong  
  
You gotta hold her now  
Never leave her  
Tell her how  
You're gonna love her, squeeze her  
Hold her now  
Never leave her again  
Never leave her again  
(Don't you go)  
  
You've got to take your time  
Take your time  
Take your time whenever you see her  
Save her every moment you can  
  
With your every wonderful feeling  
Let her know that you will be her man  
Open arms are never too open  
Lovin' hearts are never too free  
  
Let the circle never be broken  
Let it be what you want it to be  
  
You gotta hold her now  
Never leave her  
Tell her how  
You're gonna love her, squeeze her  
Hold her now  
Never leave her again  
Never leave her again  
(Don't you go)  
  
Hold her now  
Hold her now  
Never let her go

False expressions, washed up dreams

I've been thinking 'bout yu, oh baby  
And I wonder where you are tonight  
Tryin' to live without you, it's crazy'  
Cause no one else can light my fire  
  
More than a few  
Have been willing to do just what I wanted  
But as hard as they try  
It just ain't right, oh baby  
  
I can't be loved  
By anyone but you, oh baby, baby  
It's not enough  
There ain't no substitute for you  
I can't be loved by anyone but you  
I just can't live without your love  
  
My emotions, baby, are showing  
No one seems to understand  
This commotion, darlin', keeps growing  
I'm afraid it's getting out of hand  
  
Putting aside all the pain and the pride  
And I still want you, and I need you tonight  
  
Can't be loved  
There ain't no chance for new romance  
Can't be loved  
It just ain't love with someone else

Baby, baby, when I look at you  
I get a warm feeling inside  
There's something about the things you do  
That keeps me satisfied  
  
I wouldn't lie to you, baby  
It's mainly a physical thing  
This feeling that I got for you, baby  
It makes me want to sing  
  
I feel for you  
I think I love you  
I feel for you  
I think I love you  
  
Baby, baby, when I lay wit' you  
There's no place I'd rather be  
I can't believe, can't believe it's true  
The things that you do to me  
  
I wouldn't lie to you, baby  
I'm physically attracted to you  
This feeling that I got for you, baby (Ooh baby)  
There's nothing that I wouldn't do (For you girl)  
  
I feel for you  
I think I love you  
I feel for you  
I think I love you  
  
Play  
  
I think it's love  
I feel for you  
I think it's love  
I feel for you  
I think I love you  
I feel for you  
I think it's love  
  
Play  
  
I feel for you  
I think I love you  
I feel for you  
I think I love you

I finally found you  
Walkin' down the road so much older than yesterday  
I finally found you  
Such a heavy load upon your shoulders  
  
I finally found a home in Georgia  
Sweet magnolias everywhere  
Sweet love by my side  
I find my world without a care  
I finally found you  
I finally found you  
Walkin' down the road so much older than yesterday  
I finally found you  
Such a heavy load upon your shoulders  
I finally found the love I needed  
Sweet persuasion in the air  
Sweet love growing ever stronger  
I finally found you  
Etc.

I got the right street  
But the wrong direction  
Help me find the way  
To your affection  
I'm on the right train  
But the wrong track  
Come on boy  
Help me get it all back  
  
You know i love you baby  
Don't tell me maybe  
I got the right street baby  
But the wrong direction  
  
Told me that out love would last forever  
You would always be here by my side  
But you found somebody new  
And left me sittin' right here  
Wallowing in my pity and my pride  
  
I got the right street  
But the wrong direction  
Help me find the way  
To your affection  
I'm on the right train  
But the wrong track  
Come on boy  
Help me get it all back  
  
You know i love you baby  
Don't tell me maybe  
I got the right street baby  
But the wrong direction  
  
Told me you'd be livin' for my affection  
Oh you say your love grows stronger every day  
But as soon as another woman be playin' in your backyard  
You break my heart and throw my dreams away  
  
I got the right street  
But the wrong direction  
Help me find the way  
To your affection  
I'm on the right train  
But the wrong track  
Come on boy  
Help me get it all back  
  
You know i love you baby, don't say maybe  
  
Got the right street, but the wrong direction (repeat to end)

I hear music  
Mighty fine music  
The murmur of the morning breeze up there  
The rattle of the milkman on the stair  
  
Sure that's music  
Mighty fine music  
The singing of the sparrow in the sky  
The perking of the coffee right nearby  
  
That's my baby's melody  
When you my angel holding me  
  
I hear music  
Mighty fine music  
And anytime I think my world is wrong  
I get me out of bed and sing this song  
  
That's my favorite melody  
When you ma angel holding me  
  
I hear music  
Mighty fine music  
And anytime I think my world is wrong  
I get me out of bed and sing this song

It's not difficult  
For me to say I love you  
It wouldn't be difficult  
If you would say the same  
And believe me when I tell you  
That I know you very well  
I know you like I know my name  
I think that I have met you  
Somewhere in my dreams  
I may never have met you at all  
And I know you must be thinking,  
"What a silly girl"  
I know your every thought and scheme  
I wake up to the feeling each morning  
I go to bed to it at night  
I know you, I live you  
CHORUS:  
Like I feel a song in the morning  
Like I see the moon at night  
I know you as if I've known you all my life  
I know you, I live you  
One day you'll realize  
That we're not strangers  
If you open up your eyes  
You'll know me too  
And see that we were  
Meant to be together, my dear  
And all the rest is up to you  
BRIDGE  
Like I feel a song in the morning  
Like I see the moon at night  
I know you as if I've known you all my life  
I know you, I know you  
Like I feel a song in the morning  
Like I see the moon at night  
I think I know you more than you know yourself  
I know you, I live you  
Know you, live you  
Know you, live you  
Know you  
And without me you'd stumble  
And without you I'd fall  
Without each other we would not be at all  

I want to stay here  
But I ain't worthy  
You are to descent to understand  
For when I see him  
He hypnotizes me  
When he takes hold of me  
With his hard hand  
  
Someday, I know he's comin' back  
To call me  
He's gonna handle me and hold me so  
It's gonna be like dyin', Porgy  
Deep inside me,  
But when he calls I have to go  
  
I love you Porgy  
Don't let him take me  
Don't let him handle me  
And drive me mad  
If I can stay here, and you would keep me  
  
I love you Porgy  
Don't let him take me  
Don't let him handle me  
And drive me mad  
If you can keep me, I wants to stay here  
  
With you forever and I'd be glad  
I love you Porgy

If you have to do me this way  
I can't stay  
I can't - no - no  
There's a price that you'll have to pay  
And I mean you  
I mean you  
  
  
I can't let you push me around  
On the ground  
I can't - hey - no  
I'm not some new clown that you found  
  
And I mean you  
I mean you  
I mean you, yeah you, there's only me  
I mean you, yeah you  
What are you gonna do  
  
I can't let you push me around  
On the ground  
I can't - hey - no  
I'm not some new clown that you found  
I mean you, I mean you  
You can try to walk on anyone you choose  
And you haven't got a thing to lose but me!  
  
I can't  
  
If you have  
And I mean you  
I mean you  
I mean you, yeah you, there's only me  
I mean you, yeah you  
What are you gonna do  
  
I can't

I was born in Little Rock  
I had a childhood sweetheart  
We were always hand in hand  
He wore high top shoes and shirt tails  
Chaka wore her pigtails  
I knew I loved him even then  
  
Well you know my papa disapproved  
My mama boo hoo hooed  
But I told 'em time and time again  
Don't you know  
  
I was made to love him  
Build my world all around him  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
He's been my inspiration  
And shows appreciation  
For the love I gave him through the years  
Like a sweet magnolia tree  
My love blossoms tenderly  
My life grew sweeter through the years  
I know that  
  
My baby loves me  
My baby needs me  
That's why we've made it through the years  
  
I was made to love him  
Build my world all around him  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
All through thick and thin  
My love just won't end  
'Cause my I love my baby, love my baby, oh  
  
My baby loves me  
My baby needs me  
That's why we've made it through the years  
  
When I was knee-high to a chicken  
The love bug bit me  
And I'm still, still in love  
  
If the distant mountain crumble  
Love won't tumble  
I'll still be standin' there  
  
Can't go nowhere, I'm on fire...

I'll be around no matter how you treat me now  
I'll be around from now on  
Your latest love can never last, and when it's past  
I'll be around when she's gone  
Goodbye again, and if you find a love like mine  
Just now and then, drop me a line to say you're feeling fine  
And when things go wrong, perhaps you'll see you're meant for me  
So I'll be around when she's gone  
Just now and then, drop me a line to say you're feeling fine  
And when things go wrong, perhaps you'll see you're meant for me  
So I'll be around when she's gone  

I'll never open my legs again  
To a man who's insecure  
I'll never open my legs again  
Unless I'm really sure  
  
No, I'll never, never  
Never be another fool  
  
Sad but true, I slept with you  
I thought we were in love  
I even got me a rose tattoo  
But that was not enough  
  
No, I'll never, never  
Never be another fool  
  
Never, no  
Never, never, never  
  
Nothing but the best of me  
I gave with open arms  
Alive and well, I'm back from hell  
Released from your charms  
(It's time to go)  
  
Scene 23, exit, fade to black  
Tell me, why'd you have to come back?  
  
This love you need to fade  
Leave the best to yesterday  
If this only one thing is true  
I ain't gonna be another fool  
  
Never be another fool  
  
You think about callin'? Don't

I am a species born to die  
Understanding this, i hardly cry  
Growin' up and out, i'll marry you  
I'll bear your kids and be your mama too cause  
  
Chorus:  
Cause i'm a woman and i'm a backbone  
I'm a woman and i'm a backbone  
  
Everybody needs one  
  
Goin' on i live from day to day  
Give a little heart for my life to pay  
Smile and then i need to cry  
Never knowin' if i lie (or die)  
  
Chorus  
  
Understand you will not see me down  
Both of my feet are on the ground  
Come lay your head upon my chest  
I'll love you hard, i'll give my best

I'm in the mood for love  
Simply because you're near me  
Funny, but when you're near me  
I'm in the mood for love  
  
Heaven is in your eyes  
Bright as the stars we're under  
Oh, is it any wonder?  
I'm in the mood for love  
  
Why stop to think of whether  
This little dream might fade?  
Let's put our hearts together  
Now we are one, I'm not afraid  
  
If there's a cloud above  
If it should rain, we'll let it  
But for tonight forget it  
I'm in the mood for love  
  
Why stop to think of whether  
This little dream might fade?  
Let's put our hearts together  
Now we are one, I'm not afraid  
  
If there's a cloud above  
If it should rain, we'll let it  
But, for tonight, forget it  
I'm in the mood for love

(Mike Stoller, Jerry Leiber)  
  
"I remember when I was a very little girl, our house caught on fire.  
I'll never forget the look on my father's face as he gathered me up in his
arms  
And raced through the burning building out to the pavement.  
I stood there shivering in my pajamas and watched the whole world go up in
flames.  
And when it was all over I said to myself,  
'Is that all there is to a fire? '"  
  
Is that all there is?  
Is that all there is?  
If that's all there is, my friends,  
Then let's keep dancing.  
Let's break out the booze  
And have a ball  
If that's all there is.  
  
"And when I was 12 years old, my father took me to the circus, the greatest
show on earth.  
There were clowns and elephants and dancing bears and a beautiful lady in pink
tights flew high above our heads.  
And as I sat there watching the marvelous spectacle, I had the feeling that
something was missing.  
I don't know what, but when it was over I said to myself,  
'Is that all there is to a circus? '"  
  
Is that all there is?  
Is that all there is?  
If that's all there is, my friends,  
Then let's keep dancing.  
Let's break out the booze  
And have a ball  
If that's all there is.  
  
"Then I fell in love with the most wonderful boy in the world.  
We would take long walks by the river or just sit for hours gazing into each
other's eyes.  
We were so very much in love. Then one day, he went away.  
And I thought I'd die, but I didn't.  
And when I didn't, I said to myself,  
'Is that all there is to love? '"  
  
Is that all there is?  
Is that all there is?  
If that's all there is, my friends,  
Then let's keep dancing.  
  
"I know what you must be saying to yourselves.  
'If that's the way she feels about it why doesn't she just end it all? '  
Oh, no. Not me. I'm in no hurry for that final disappointment.  
For I know just as well as I'm standing here talking to you,  
When that final moment comes and I'm breathing my last breath,  
I'll be saying to myself... "  
  
Is that all there is?  
Is that all there is?  
If that's all there is, my friends,  
Then let's keep dancing.  
Let's break out the booze  
And have a ball  
If that's all there is.

VERSE 1:  
Everybody's having a real good time  
The man you're talking to is not yours, he's mine  
Better chill out, hear what I'm saying  
Before I stop the music playin'  
CHORUS:  
It's my party, I'll start it, I'll end it  
Baby, it's my party, I'm upset and offended  
While I'm all alone, and the party's goin' strong  
It's a celebration, to better our relation  
A sudden flash in my vision  
Rendezvousin' in the kitchen  
Kit got lost, and I found him all involved  
He was wearing a guilty face  
He had his arms around her waist  
And lipstick on his face  
CHORUS  
VERSE 1  
Say you had too much to drink  
Lost your head and couldn't think  
A sudden flash in my vision  
Rendezvousin' in the kitchen  
Then you got lost, and I found you all involved  
Wearing a guilty face  
Had your arms around her waist  
And lipstick on your face  
Cecil: Oh, tell me what it is  
Chaka: Ooh, you had lipstick on your face  
Cecil: Oh, tell me what'd you see  
Chaka: Rendezvousin' in the kitchen  
Cecil: Oh baby, what it's gonna be  
Chaka: Gonna stop this music playing  
Cecil: Oh, do you trust in me  
Chaka: It's very plain to see  

There's a feeling I just can't deny  
It's fire straight from my soul  
And it's hot enough to tear you up  
Make you lose control  
  
Gonna soothe you, put you in a trance  
And get your sense aroused  
So there ain't no use in holdin' back  
Gotta let that feelin' out  
  
[Chorus:]  
Live in me, come in, my life  
Fill me with all that sweet delight  
I'm burnin' up, steamin' inside  
So give me the love I need tonight  
  
Foolin' 'round, you got no time to waste  
So, baby, turn out the light  
And let's get down to what it takes  
To keep me satisfied  
Don't give me dreams, I don't want to know  
'Cause I need something to hold  
And action speaks more tenderness  
Than words could ever show, so...  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Groove with the motion  
Let's take it to the top  
Ride with the feeling  
There's no way I'm gonna stop  
I'll give you heaven  
To help you through the day  
And super lovin'  
Takes your breath away  
  
Live in me (just live in me)  
Come in, my life (come in, my life)  
Fill me with all that sweet delight  
(Fill me with love, that sweet delight)  
I'm burnin' up, steamin' inside  
(I'm burnin' up, steamin' inside)  
So give me the love I need tonight  
(Just give me love I need tonight)

Here is my hand for you to hold.  
Here's a part of me they have not sold.  
I've wandered far, I've had my fill.  
I need you now, do you love me still?  
  
Only you have seen the hidden part of me  
Call me fool hearted if you will.  
I loved you then, do you love me still?  
  
So many smiles and lies surround me.  
Empty expectations, faceless fears.  
Sometimes this life is a bitter pill.  
I love you now, do you love me still?  
  
You have been mine since time untold.  
Our love is immortal, don't you know?  
Others will come and they will go.  
But I love you young and I love you old.  
  
Only you have seen the other side of me.  
Call me naive, I think you will.  
I loved you then, do you love me still?  
  
Here are the eyes that only see you.  
Here's the mouth that only calls your name.  
Here is the song they cannot kill.  
I love you now, do you love me still?

Love of a lifetime  
Good for you (heart of change)  
Got to be the heart of change  
Good for me - a heart of change  
I know we'll get it better  
Stir it up (got to be)  
Stir it tender heartedly  
Stir it and  
The whole world's gettin' better  
  
[Bridge]  
I believe the world to be  
Fast and ever changing  
That's the way my love will be  
Got to last and satisfy me  
  
[Chorus]  
You got the love of a lifetime  
You're such a rock steady lover, baby  
Keep up the good love for chaka  
You can hold it, boy  
'cause you don't let it go  
  
Good for you  
Good for me  
The way we work together  
Short and sweet (hit and run)  
I know where you're comin' from  
We can steal  
And baby, we'll hit and run together  
  
[Bridge]  
  
We got the love of a lifetime  
Ooh, we're such rock steady lovers, baby  
Keep up the good love together  
We can hold it, boy  
And never let it go  
  
We got the love of a lifetime  
We got to keep on rockin' steady  
I really think I'm ready now  
Baby, I'm burnin', burnin', burnin'  
  
You got the love of a lifetime  
You're such a rock steady lover, baby  
Keep up the good love for chaka  
You can hold it, boy, never let it go  
We got the love of a lifetime  
Ooh, we're such rock steady lovers, baby  
Keep up the good love together  
Hold it, boy  
  
Love of a lifetime  
(love of a lifetime)  
We got the love, we got the love  
We got the love  
Guess it's just a heart of change  
We got the love, we got the love  
We got the love  
It's got to be a heart of change  
We got the love, we got the love...

I, I can't explain  
How ya got inside my system  
But I feel the sweetest pain  
I, I can't do that  
But I got to break this tension  
If it makes you feel the same  
  
An ordinary woman  
That's all I am  
And I think I'm falling  
For an ordinary man  
  
Take me to your heart  
When the love begins  
You and I can only try  
To make a love with no strings  
Take me to your heart  
When the story ends  
You and I we can't deny  
We're making love with no strings  
No conductor  
Could've played this situation  
Better than a fool or millionaire  
I won't tie you down  
With a little love and affection  
All I want to do is share  
  
A little time together  
Maybe holding hands  
An ordinary woman  
And an ordinary man  
  
Take me to your heart  
When the love begins  
You and I could say goodbye  
And we'll always be friends  
Take me to your heart  
When the story ends  
You and I we can't deny  
We got a love with no strings  

Cold endless summer days  
Since you went away  
Tore my heart in two  
And now wandering through the night  
I see the city lights  
Feelin' so in need  
I'll never be at peace  
  
[Chorus]  
Love you all my lifetime  
Lost to you eternally  
Everything in my life  
Tells me we were meant to be  
  
Strange there's always something wrong  
Dreams don't last that long  
What part did I play in that game  
And now, now you turn away  
Excuses are too late  
Feelin' so in need, I'll never be at peace  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You make the rain and the night go away  
You make the sun rise up in my sky  
You make the rain and the night go away  
You make the sun rise up in my sky

Say there is magic in his mind  
Reflecting in his eyes  
It's that mystery draws me to you  
This kind of voodoo's hard to find  
  
I detect a little gypsy in his smile  
I think I'll stay for awhile  
I need some lovin' it's my turn and  
I got a little fire left to burn  
  
Oh if he would just remain  
I'd show him how I could love him  
Or I get the feeling that he knows me  
From some other time before  
Wonder how he could forget me  
Can't explain why I'm comin' back for more

Come on and stay with me for a little while  
Hey can't we spend some time together  
You look so good to me and I like your style  
Come on let's make it last forever  
I'm not an ordinary woman  
I just want to love you with all my might  
You better believe that I'm a good one  
And I wanna guarantee I'll treat you right  
Come on and stay with me for a little while  
Come on and spend some time together  
Whatever it takes I'm gonna make you smile  
Hey can't we make it last forever  
I know that love's a gamble  
Puttin' all my lovin' on the line  
There ain't a man that I can't handle  
Give me your love, and I'll give you mine  

I got a... Going down  
It's a party invitation we're putting down  
So come on ya'll give it a chance  
Get up and dance  
Got to groove, get your body loose  
And join the band  
Help spread the word about the masterjam  
It's a soulful revolution that can't be beat  
We'll rerun the constitution and heat your feet  
So come on ya'll give it a chance  
Get up and dance  
Got to groove, get your body loose  
And join the band  
Help spread the word about the masterjam  
  
We got to wake up the world  
And change it all tonight  
Gonna spend it around and wake it up with part lights  
So forget about your troubles and live the...  
And rock the country and don't look back  
  
So come on ya'll give it a chance...  
We could rule the world with the Masterjam repeat)  
  
Come on take my hand, join the band  
Got to tell the world about the masterjam  
Got to tell the world, got to tell the world  
Got to tell the world, got to tell the world  
  
(Repeat over and over)

Chorus:  
Music man play your song for me  
Music man fill my soul  
Music man play a melody  
Music man take control  
  
I listen to you play your heartaches  
I listen to you play your dreams  
I listen to your every feeling  
I wonder what you really mean  
  
Chorus  
  
I sit alone at night and wonder  
Could you be playin' just for me  
I wait for you to play my future  
I wait for you to set me free  
  
Chorus  
  
In your little room you sit all night long  
Playin' for someone that you cannot see  
Do you wonder if someone really hears  
What you're tryin' to say with your melody  
  
Chorus

You, you carry your dreams in your eyes  
And if someone hurts you, you cry  
And you, you live on a cloud in the sky  
And wish on the stars shooting by  
Don't let the little woes of life harm me  
Let the joy in the life your lead  
Let it charm you  
Let it charm you  
CHORUS:  
Nothing's gonna take you away  
Nothing's gonna break your heart  
Nothing's gonna take you away  
Nothing's gonna break your heart  
You, you go barefootin' when there are showers  
You like to listen to coltrane for hours  
And you're gonna need smeone standing by  
And on me you can always rely  

Once you get started, oh it's hard to stop  
You can't stop you just can't stop  
When you get down y'all  
When you get down ain't no turnin' back no  
Everybody party hearty  
To get back in the groove  
I like the way you do it .. way you do it  
I like the way you move  
It's a good thing  
Hear a funky sound  
Everybody let's get on down  
You gon do it like you never done before  
Hey .. hey  
I just want you to know that  
Once you get started, oh it's hard to stop  
You can't stop you just can't stop  
When you get down y'all  
When you get down ain't no turnin' back no  
Everybody party hearty  
To get right in the groove  
I love the way you do it .. way you do it  
I like the way you move  
It's the new thing  
When ya know that ya getting' on down, yeah  
Everybody come on y'all and get down with me  
You can do it like you never done before, yeah  
Once you get started, oh it's hard to stop  
You can't stop you just can't stop  
When you get down y'all  
When you get down ain't no turnin' back no  
Now that ya got down  
We just wanna say  
If you dig the funky, funky music  
Come on and move it this way  
Come on and move, come on and groove (repeat to end)  

Feeling the heat,  
I can't keep  
The pressure off me.  
Hear the man say  
Earn your pay  
Or I'll let you go today.  
  
But that's not for me  
I was born to be alive  
Not livin' to survive  
Come closer to me, baby  
Make me believe it, I can  
  
Own the night  
Reach up and touch the light  
Own the night  
You make me come alive  
I own the night.  
  
Here in the dark,  
Turn it on  
Love me forever like this.  
Baby don't stop  
Make it hot  
I want to taste your burn again  
  
Take me away  
To a place I've never known  
Livin' right down to the bone  
Closer to me baby,  
Make me believe it, I can  
  
Own the night  
Reach up and touch the light  
(love still shines)  
Own the night  
You make me come alive  
I own the night.  
  
You make me feel  
I own the night  
  
Own the night  
Touch the light  
(love still shines)  
Own the night  
  
(repeat to end)

A faded photograph I mailed to you  
With feelings I don't want to face  
And a long song of surrender in blue  
I remember when you took my breath away  
  
CHORUS:  
  
Chanson papillon, we were very young  
Like butterflies, like hot butterfly  
Chanson papillon, we had just begun  
We let it slide on by  
We didn't realize  
  
All our memories are burning in time  
Like a bittersweet perfume  
Can you tell me how a love that's so fine  
Could have climaxed in a single afternoon  
  
Gone are the days of instant romance  
And the nights of slow goodbyes  
That was a time of life when foxy was the dance  
But then you got wise to all my lies  
  
CHORUS  
  
Chanson papillon, chanson  
Chanson papillon, chanson  
Chanson papillon, chanson  
Chanson papillon, chanson

A faded photograph I mailed to you  
With feelings I don't want to face  
And a long song of surrender in blue  
I remember when you took my breath away  
  
[Chorus]  
Chanson papillon, we were very young  
Like butterflies, like hot butterfly  
Chanson papillon, we had just begun  
We let it slide on by  
We didn't realize  
  
All our memories are burning in time  
Like a bittersweet perfume  
Can you tell me how a love that's so fine

A brand new meaning  
For what's goin' on today  
I felt it comin'  
Thought I'd pass it on your way  
In case your head's in the mighty fog  
There's a thought, a show in the dark, I say  
  
Pass it on, sure thing, pass it on  
Pass it on, sure thing, pass it on  
  
Pass it on, a sure thing, baby  
  
Good things coming  
If you care to wait your turn  
Heart's desire  
With enough here left to burn  
Because the love's all around you see  
If you're lovin' you will receive, I say  
  
Pass it on, sure thing, pass it on  
Pass it on, sure thing, pass it on  
  
A sure thing, baby  
Make it feel good tonight  
Make it feel real good  
Baby, baby, baby, baby  
Well, well, well, well  
  
Just imagine havin' to know it all  
No more guessin'  
'cause your left hand's in the thought  
Consult me when you need a friend  
Pass it on and you're feelin' lost, well  
  
Pass it on, sure thing, pass it on  
Pass it on, sure thing, pass it on  
Pass it on, sure thing, pass it on  
Pass it on, sure thing, pass it on  
Pass it on, sure thing, pass it on

Running to fight  
Spirit in the night  
Like a dog to bite  
Everything in sight  
Give me love you say  
There's a price you have to pay  
With momma's life you cannot play  
Make things right you need to be saying...  
Right is right, wrong is wrong  
Right is right, wrong is wrong  
  
Fists come to town  
Blood on the ground  
Momma's crying, 'Lord have mercy! '  
Mercy's hard to find  
It's just a state of mind  
Drop the..., get out the way  
We don't have another day  
  
Right is right, wrong is wrong  
Right is right, wrong is wrong  
  
He said he's comng by five my friend  
And I desire to live again  
If you hear me let me know woa woa woa woa  
  
Right is right, wrong is wrong (three times)  
  
He said he's coming by five my friend  
And I desire to live again  
If you here me let me know  
The world is full of woa!

It begins to tell,  
'round midnight, midnight.  
I do pretty well, till after sundown,  
Suppertime I'm feelin' sad,  
But it really gets bad,  
'round midnight.  
  
Memories always start 'round midnight  
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories,  
When my heart is still with you,  
And ol' midnight knows it, too.  
  
When a quarrel we had needs mending,  
Does it mean that our love is ending.  
Darlin' I need you, lately I find  
You're out of my heart,  
And I'm out of my mind.  
  
Let our hearts take wings'  
'round midnight, midnight  
Let the angels sing,  
For your returning.  
  
Till our love is safe and sound.  
And old midnight comes around.  
Feelin' sad,  
Really gets bad  
Round  
Round  
Round  
Mid  
Night

In a messed up world  
Filled with mixed up people  
Searching for a happy time  
It makes me feel so good  
Just to have a situation  
Where you love me and I know that I'm...  
  
Chorus:  
I'm so satisfied  
I'm so satisfied  
Man don't you understand your love  
Made me smile again  
And I'm so satisfied  
  
Oh there are those who want the world  
While those who have it want to throw it away  
But of all the things there are, love's the most important  
So believe me baby when I say  
  
Chorus:  
I'm so satisfied  
I'm so satisfied  
Man don't you understand your love  
Made me smile again  
And I'm so satisfied

CHORUS:  
Do ya, do ya have a secret friend  
Playin' around, hangin' out again  
  
Your love has been like a stranger  
Your love is hiding behind a closed door  
You're an ace at using deception  
'Cause you don't want to let me go  
  
CHORUS  
  
Be ashamed to lose good lovin'  
Chasin' dreams in the night the way we do  
There's no way, you got to be honest  
I'll do anything to make it right for you  
  
CHORUS  
  
Can't you see it's just an attraction  
He can feed you lies so easily  
I can't wait forever  
Girl, let me go or come to me  
Tell me ...  
  
CHORUS

Take it from me, I've had the experience  
Finding the right love ain't easy to do  
I've been looking and looking and searching around since  
Nature started teching me just what to do  
  
I can feel it bubbling up  
All this love needs somewhere to live  
Come and take a drink from my cup  
I have a heart with so much to give  
  
All the love is here so take it  
Darlin' you know we can make it  
  
Chorus:  
I knew the minute I saw you  
You were the one who'd be  
Sharin' the love  
I have the feeling inside me  
You'll be beside me  
Sharin' the love  
  
I never believed in love at first sight  
It's a foolish dreamer's fantasy  
But one look at you showed me the light  
And made a foolish dreamer of me  
  
I can feel it bubbling up  
All this love needs somewhere to live  
Come and take a drink from my cup  
I have a heart with so much to give  
  
All the love is here so take it  
It would be a sin to waste it  
  
Chorus

Oh yeah  
  
In France, skinny man  
Died of a big disease with a little name  
By chance his girlfriend came across a needle  
Soon she did the same  
  
At home there are seventeen year old boys  
And their idea of fun  
Is being in a gang called The Disciples  
High on crack, totin' a machine gun  
  
Time  
  
Hurricane Annie ripped the ceiling of a church  
And killed everyone inside  
You turn on the telly and every other story  
Tellin' you somebody died  
  
Sister killed her baby 'cause she could afford to feed it  
They were sending rockets to the moon  
September my cousin tried reefer for the very first time  
Now he's doing horse, it's June  
  
Time, time, yeah  
  
It's silly no, when a rocket ship explodes  
Everybody still want to fly  
Some say a man ain't happy  
Unless a man truly dies, oh why?  
  
Time, time, time  
  
Baby make a speech, star wars fly  
Neighbors just shine it on  
But if the night falls and a bomb falls  
Then everybody sees dawn  
  
Time, time  
  
It's silly now, when a rocket ship explodes  
Everybody still wants to fly  
Some say a man ain't happy, truly, yeah  
Until he dies, oh why?  
  
Time, time, time, time  
  
Sign o' the times mess with your mind  
Hurry before it's too late  
Let's fall in love, get married, have a baby  
We'll call him Nate, if it's a boy  
  
Time, time  
Everybody, yeah  
Sign o' the times  
[Incomprehensible]  
Time, sign o' the times  
  
Don't you know we can change the world?  
Don't you know every boy and every girl  
Deserves to live life, deserves a peace of mind?  
Sign o' the times  
  
Don't you know we can change the world?  
Don't you know every boy and every girl  
Deserves to live life, deserves a peace of mind?  
Sign o' the times  
  
Don't you know we can change the world?  
Don't you know every boy and every girl  
Deserves to live life, deserves a peace of mind?  
Sign o' the times

Band gonna play that rock 'n roll  
Sound of the music gonna groove your soul  
Band gonna do that slip 'n slide  
Sound of the music gonna get you high  
  
Now if you dig Chuck Berry and your head's into rock 'n roll  
Come on down the road a piece  
The cats are gonna burn your soul  
  
Chorus:  
And they all was a reelin'  
Well they all was a rockin'  
The place was blown sky high  
Grandpa's sittin' in the corner  
Mixin' his rock with rye  
  
Now if you dig the dixieland and your heart's into rhythm and blues  
Come on down the road a piece  
The cats are gonna break the news  
  
Chorus:  
And they all was a reelin'  
They all was a rockin'  
The bass man drives it on home  
Now if you dig the dixieland  
Listen to that slide trombone  
  
If you think I'm a bit old-fashioned  
And you want to maintain your cool  
The rhythm of the music is guaranteed  
To make you out a fool  
  
Chorus:  
And they all was a slippin'  
They all was a slidin'  
The place was blown sky high  
Now if you dig the boogie  
The cats will blow your mind  
  
Band gonna play that rock 'n roll  
Sound of the music gonna groove your soul  
Band gonna do that slip 'n slide  
Sound of the music gonna get you high  
  
Slip 'n slide  
Slip 'n slide

Here we are alone in this old smokin' room again  
If your highness is your pleasure it's alright  
Cause there's an extra added goodness  
In my heart for you tonight  
If there's any such a thing as god  
He must be here tonight  
  
Ain't sayin' I'm right  
Ain't sayin' I'm wrong  
Ain't sayin' there's any such a thing as short or long  
It seems you been here many times before  
It's too beautiful but true  
And I'm glad I got the chance tonight  
To share my now with you  
  
I used to be locked in a closet and I couldn't find the key  
Used to be you'd look my way but not see me  
But it's happiness to know that from yourself you cannot hide  
And that here's where I am and it's you that's by my side  
  
Ain't sayin' I'm right  
Ain't sayin' I'm wrong  
Ain't sayin' there's any such a thing as short or long  
It seems you been here many times before  
It's too beautiful but true  
And I'm glad I got the chance tonight  
To share my now, share my now  
Oh baby baby ? oh yeah  
  
So glad I gotcha spend some time  
Spend some time glad I gotcha baby (repeat)  
  
So glad I gotcha share my life  
Share my life glad I gotcha baby (repeat)  
  

You've been keeping me in limbo  
Playing hide and seek  
You've been teasing me 'cause you know  
That it makes me weak  
You've done everything to fall in love  
I know what you're running from  
Kisses like these are few and far between  
Now we're so close yet so far away  
I'm breaking down the distance  
With every move, with every touch  
You're wearing down my resistance  
You know your lonely days are numbered  
There's nothing you can do  
There'll be no more keeping us apart  
I'm ready for the love to start  
I can almost feel it breaking through  
Now we're so close yet so far away  
I'm breaking down the distance  
With every move and every touch  
I'm wearing down your resistance  
I wanna get closer, closer to you  
I can almost feel it breaking through  
So close yet so far away  
I'm breaking down the distance  
With every move and every touch  
I'm wearing down your resistance  
So close yet so far away  
I'm breaking down the distance  
With every touch and every move  
You're wearing down my resistance  

At the gypsy's eye  
When the moon is high  
And the mood is right for dancing, romancing  
While Michael Wails  
In his baggy tails  
Makes it all seem so enhancing for dancing  
CHORUS:  
Oh you're so naughty  
Oh with your body  
Oh you're so naughty  
I wanna get naughty with you  
If you want me to  
All those fools out there  
Could they be aware  
I just need someone to come home to  
But you are so rare, I don't even care  
'Cause I got you to roam with  
Could I be dreamin'  
Am I with you  
My heart is screamin'  
Could this be true  
Let's keep it goin'  
Our love is rare  
Let's keep it growin'  
We're almost there  

You think she's really waiting  
I heard a different tune  
You'll let her think he wants her  
And I think she wants him too  
What she don't know won't hurt her  
She's got her secrets too  
She doesn't know about me  
The feeling's up to you, up to you  
So not to worry  
Don't be afraid, not tonight  
It's all the same, love  
I'm in no hurry and  
If we make love, it's alright  
Alright (tonight)  
Alright (tonight)  
Bring back the day I met you  
We knew it then, my love  
You smiled goodbye, then told me  
That your time was not your own  
I see you five years later  
Two thousand miles away  
You left her for a mission  
And I left him for the same  
For the same  
So not to worry  
Don't be afraid, not tonight  
It's all the same, love  
I'm in no hurry and  
If we make love, it's alright  
Well, well, well, well  
My, my, my, my  
So much for being faithful  
We've let them down again  
I wasn't very helpful  
And you didn't stop my hand  
Stop my hand, oh  
So not to worry  
When we made love, it felt right  
It's all the same, love (all the same, oh)  
We didn't hurry (we didn't hurry)  
If when we made love, it felt right, alright  
So not to worry  
If we make love, it's alright  
(Alright) It's alright, tonight's the night  
That you're gonna love me babe (aw, feels so good)  
(Alright) It's alright, tonight's the night  
That you're gonna love me babe (aw, it feels so good)  
(Alright) It's alright, tonight's the night  
That you're gonna love me babe (oooh, feels so good babe)  
(Alright) It's alright, tonight's the night  
That you're gonna love me babe (alright, feels so good)  
(Alright) It's alright, tonight's the night  
That you're gonna love me babe (feels so good)  
(Alright) It's alright, tonight's the night  
That you're gonna love me babe (oh, feels so good)  
(Alright) It's alright, tonight's the night  
That you're gonna love me babe  
(Alright) It's alright, tonight's the night  
That you're gonna love me babe (aw, it feels so good, feels so good)  
(Alright) It's alright, tonight's the night  
That you're gonna love me babe (oh, it feels so good, baby babe)  
(Alright) It's alright, tonight's the night  
That you're gonna love me babe (oh it's alright)  
(Alright) It's alright, tonight's the night  
That you're gonna love me babe  
(Alright) It's alright, tonight's the night  
That you're gonna love me babe (ohh)  

You're now aware of your situation  
You wasted time with contemplation  
Instead of trying to be so cool my friend  
Understand this way you'll never win  
  
You say it's darkest just before the dawn  
You get discouraged if it takes too long  
Common sense will tell you right from wrong  
My advice is that you carry on  
  
Don't get me wrong, there's more to life than gold  
There are fortunes here that can't be bought or sold  
Cause your diamonds lie within your soul  
You can't count your cash 6 feet under, stiff and cold  
  
Somebody's watchin', somebody's watchin' you  
Somebody's watchin', yes I know it's true  
Somebody's watchin', somebody's watchin' you  
Somebody's watchin', saw ya, saw ya, saw ya

Why'd you have to take me there?  
You start the fire, then you put it out  
I have to depend on my imagination  
I didn't want to fade what you've been puttin' down  
  
But then you say the word  
Then I go under  
  
Every time you go  
Missing you so  
Somethin' deep  
Baby come around  
Missing you now  
Somethin' deep  
(Deeper, going deeper down without you honey)  
  
It's more confusing by the hour  
You set me free, but you don't go away  
I try to think about somebody else  
That's when I know I just can't help myself  
So baby say the word and take me over  
  
Every time you go  
Missing you so  
Somethin' deep  
Baby come around  
Missing you now  
Somethin' deeply

Some girls need emotion  
Some girls just want some fun  
Some look for devotion  
Some just wanna run  
Some crave for affection  
Burnin' up inside  
Some need the direction  
For the world outside  
You can dance the dance 'til the mornin' comes  
But I'll tell you where I'm comin' from  
CHORUS:  
I wanna hear your soul' talkin'  
Wanna hear your soul' talkin'  
Wanna hear your soul' talkin'  
It's the heart of the matter  
It's the root of the cause  
It's the still of the moment  
It's that heavenly pause  
Well I don't need a savior  
And I don't need a slave  
I just want to hear you  
Through that magnetic wave  
What I need is a link to the inner mind  
If you want to know my bottom line  

One heart  
One hand  
One woman  
One man  
To love  
To live together  
  
This time  
This place  
This lifelong embrace  
Could last  
Could be forever  
  
This time  
Endings don't apply  
No broken hearts  
No crying eyes  
This time  
No emptiness for us  
Just you and I  
In love this time  
  
To trust  
To care  
To dream and  
To dare  
Believe in  
Something better  
  
This time  
Endings don't apply  
No broken hearts  
No crying eyes  
This time  
No emptiness for us  
Just you and I  
In love this time  
  
Here because the angels smiled on us  
The angels smiled on us, this time  
Here because we're the ones who shine  
We're the ones who shine, this time

I look in  
your eyes and I can see  
We've loved so dangerously  
You're not trusting your heart to anyone  
You tell me you're gonna play it smart  
We're through before we start  
But I believe that we've only just begun  
  
When it's this good, there's no saying no  
I want you so, I'm ready to go  
  
[Chorus]  
Through the fire  
To the limit, to the wall  
For a chance to be with you  
I'd gladly risk it all  
Through the fire  
Through whatever, come what may  
For a chance at loving you  
I'd take it all the way  
Right down to the wire  
Even through the fire  
  
I know you're afraid of what you feel  
You still need time to heal  
And I can help if you'll only let me try  
You touch me and something in me knew  
What I could have with you  
Well I'm not ready to kiss that dream goodbye  
  
When it's this sweet, there's no saying no  
I need you so, I'm ready to go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Through the test of time  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Through the fire, to the limit  
Through the fire, through whatever  
Through the fire, to the limit  
Through the fire, through whatever

I'm looking for love, dear love  
And I'm searching high and low, oh  
I need me someone to wrap his arms around me  
And to never let me go  
  
I found a man who seemed to be just right  
He took my love and then he said goodbye  
Now I, spend my nights alone, looking for my  
  
Tight fit, Tight fit  
Got to find me the right fit  
Tight fit, Tight fit  
Got to find me the right fit  
Tight fit, Tight fit  
Looking high and low, yeah  
  
I went to him, down with the fever  
And you know, he had the cure, yes he did  
He held my heart in palm of his hand  
And he made me feel secure (I knew he would)  
  
He seemed to be having so much fun  
The clock struck one and then he had to run  
Now I spend my nights alone, looking for my...

When you try and look inside  
Your lover's lovely eyes  
And you're not sure of what you're seein'  
And you're thinkin' all the time  
Of the tings you should have said and done  
And what it all could really mean  
Remember that ...  
  
CHORUS:  
True love never looks back on heartache  
True love never looks back on sorrow  
True love only looks to tomorrow  
True love never fades  
  
When you're lookin' for some lies  
To build a new disguise  
So you can run away again  
Usin' anger as a fuel  
You go breakin' every rule in sight  
Thinkin' that this might be the end  
Remember that ...  
  
CHORUS  
  
Is there really any wonder why you're feelin this way  
Livin' with a dream can cut just like a knife  
Is there really any wonder why you're lonely today  
When you're givin' up livin' up your live  
Remember that ...  
  
CHORUS

Chorus:  
  
Turn, Turn, Turn  
Turn, Turn, Turn  
Turn, Turn, Turn  
  
Verse 1  
  
Bring on all the seasons  
Repeat your earlier deeds  
Show the children your face  
Most of all teach them to...  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
Verse 2  
  
Bring on all the colors  
Don't let me forget for a moment  
What I have to do  
It's all so necessary for you to...  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
Bridge  
  
We will rehearse long and hard  
For the big celebration  
Spread the leaders among us  
Like the heat's in the sun  
Like the blue is in the sky  
Like the peace in the eyes  
Of the believers of god  
  
Well if there's a will  
There's a way  
If we're strong it will pay  
Look at the babies all around us  
Like the moon in the night  
Like a bird takin flight  
Though this world is not right  
We got to show them the way...  
  
Repeat chorus

Here, certified unsound I feel like you  
There's someone I've found, so far he's true  
Out of me there's a voice which keeps calling  
I'm hiding alone, crazy I know, and I am  
Tied to your strings and twisted  
I'm just waiting to show the others who know  
And I am tied to your strings and twisted  
So medication still the devil in me  
So into make believe, your smile I see  
Out of me there's a voice which keeps calling  
I'm hiding alone, crazy I know, and I am  
Tied to your strings and twisted  
I'm just waiting to show the others who know  
That I am tied to your strings and twisted  
Hold me in this tiny room sedated here I'll stay  
Next to me, I beg of you don't throw the key away  
Out of me there's a voice which keeps calling  
I'm hiding alone, crazy I know, and I am  
Tied to your strings and twisted  
I'm just waiting to show the others who know  
That I am tied to your strings and twisted  
I'm hiding alone, crazy I know, and I am  
Tied to your strings and twisted  
I'm just waiting to show all the others who know  
That I am tied to your strings and twisted  
I'm going crazy, boy, look out  
(Tied to your strings and twisted) Look out, boy  

Rockets launch us to outer space  
Far away from this human wasteland  
We're bringing heaven to other worlds  
Abandoning the home fires of our birth  
There are fools who believe we can't live here as one  
There are wise men who say it still can be done  
Chorus:  
I'm watching the world  
I'm watching the change in power  
I'm watching the world  
Are we building a future or just standing still?  
We will harvest the fields of wheat  
For a promise of food to eat  
Forging plows to make swords for war  
We can stop this fighting and open the door  
Only fools could believe we can't live here as one  
Who's to say it cannot be done  
Chorus:  
Who is watching this world?  
Who is changing the balance of power?  
I'm watching the world  
Are we building a future or just standing still?  
Vamp  
Watching the world  
Only fools would believe we can't live here as one  
Who's to say it cannot be done  
Chorus  
Watching the world  
Who is changing the balance of power?  
I'm watching the world  
Are we building a future or just standing still? (just standing still)  
Watching the world  
Who is changing the balance of power?  
We're watching the world  
We're building a future  
We're not standing still  
I'm watching the world  
Who is changing the balance of power?  
I'm watching the world  
We're building a future  
I'm not standing still  
I'm watching this world  
Watching the world (7x)  

CHORUS:  
Walkin' hand and hand  
As only lovers can  
You must understand  
We've got each other  
They can scream and fuss  
It won't bother us  
And that is because  
We've got each other  
I can recall memories we shared  
Such love, none other could compare  
Do you remember when you were loving me?  
Holding me? How could this love not be?  
CHORUS  
Lost in dreams, I spend the hours  
Scared in the dark, in a room that once was ours  
Do you remember when you were loving me?  
Holding me? How could this love not be?  
BRIDGE:  
We are one sharing each other's dreams  
With a love that only we could bring  
I've got you (I've got you)  
We've got each other  
I've got you (I've got you)  
We've got each other  
I've got you (I've got you)  
We've got each other  
I've got you (I've got you too)  
We've got each other  
I've got you (I've got you)  
We've got each other  
I've got you (I've got you too)  
We've got each other  
We've got each other  
We've got stride for stride  
Movin' side by side  
With a strength and pride  
We've got each other  
They can scream and fuss  
It won't break our trust  
What we've got is us  
We've got each other  
We've got each other  
We've got each other  

You know it hurts me  
When I can't be next to you  
And though we're young I know  
You feel the same way, too  
Deep in our hearts we know  
It?s just a matter of time  
?Cause we?ll be together one day  
And when we met  
Out on the streets along the way  
It wasn't by chance that we  
Were passing by that day  
As sure as there's a moon  
And stars above I know  
We?ll be together for sure  
As sure as that nose on your face  
We were meant for each other?s arms  
Just as one and one make two  
You were made for me  
I was made for [unverified]  
don't try to hide that smile  
I know that's on your face  
And when you [unverified] at me  
I?ll look the other way  
And we won't give away  
What we know from the start  
That we've got that love in our hearts  
Deep in our hearts  
In our hearts, we've got that love  
In our hearts, we've got that love  
In our hearts, we've got that love  
Oh, deep down in our hearts  
We've got that love  
Oh, we're very into lovin?, yeah  
Oh, that love in our hearts  
We've got that love in our hearts  
Oh baby, we've got that love
