Higher  
It's what I expect from my life  
It's like a wire  
That holds me back down to the ground  
  
Oh, I hear you say  
"That is the way of the world"  
No, hear what I say  
"I want to do so much in my way"  
  
Higher  
I've set my limits and bounds  
There's a fire  
It's burning so hot in my head  
  
Oh, I hear you say  
"That is the way of the world"  
No, hear what I say  
"I want to do so much in my way"  
  
[Chorus]  
We got  
A little time to build up your lives  
A little time to make up our minds  
A little time to fill up our dreams  
A little time, time  
  
[Chorus]

Born into somewhere unseen and unknown  
Just like a worder so small and alone  
Take me away into your innocent dreams  
Maybe I'd see what it all means  
  
A million to one  
You will lose it all  
A million to one you'll be falling  
Down o where I am  
An unholy man  
A million to one you'll be falling  
  
It's so sad and so true  
but what can I do  
Owly a few years then it's up to you  
To care for yourself,  
I hope I gave good advice  
For all your life How to survive  
  
A million to one  
You will lose it all  
A million to one you'll be falling  
Down o where I am  
An unholy man  
A million to one you'll be falling  
  
A million to one  
You will lose it all  
A million to one you'll be falling  
Down o where I am  
An unholy man  
A million to one you'll be falling

Close your eyes and I'll kiss you  
Tomorrow I'll miss you  
Remember I'll always be true  
And then while I'm away  
I'll write home every day  
And I'll send all my loving to you  
  
I'll pretend that I'm kissing  
The lips I am missing  
And hope that my dreams will come true  
And then while I'm away  
I'll write home every day  
And I'll send all my loving to you  
  
All my loving, I will send to you  
All my loving, darling I'll be true  
  
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you  
Tomorrow I'll miss you  
Remember I'll always be true  
And then while I'm away  
I'll write home every day  
And I'll send all my loving to you  
  
All my loving, I will send to you  
All my loving, darling I'll be true  
All my loving, all my loving  
Woo, all my loving, I will send to you

I keep wondering all these days  
How to thrive the way we stray  
A year, a lifetime - parted, together  
will be all the same  
Many things to make me sad  
Some can even drive me mad  
Just fear forever  
No more endevours  
Leave me where I stand  
  
You are here  
And make me feel so high  
Day by day  
Something one can't deny  
Lets give each other certainty  
All over the nations the tunes come alive  
Winners and losers, we're all alike  
No matter as truth ain't some great mystery  
We all fade into one  
  
Don't you feel too hypnotized  
Or keep your future jeopardized  
So what's accomplished crying for nothing?  
Skip depression now  
  
Come, arise and take me higher  
No more lies, and every soul can see  
We're incarnate sincerety  
All over the nations the tunes come alive  
Winners and losers, we're all alike  
No matter as truth ain't some great mystery  
We all fade into one  
  
All over the nations the tunes come alive  
Winners and losers, we're all alike  
No matter as truth ain't some great mystery  
We all fade into one

I love it loud, let's push it higher  
Until the gain shows just red light  
I love it true and played with fire  
I enjoy a battle without fight  
  
What I hear I adhere  
Have no fear, say sincere  
  
Are you metal  
Are you metal  
Are you  
Are you  
Are you metal  
Heavy metal  
Are you metal  
  
Call me insane, call me hard wired  
But it's the only noise I like  
Believe in loud and fast and higher  
I can tell the sound of wrong or right  
  
What I hear I adhere  
Have no fear, say sincere  
  
Are you metal  
Are you metal  
Are you  
Are you  
Are you metal  
Heavy metal  
Are you metal

I close my eyes so I don't have to see  
I shut my heart and tell my mind to run and flee  
Once I was flying, flying, flying high  
I touched the sky  
  
As long as I fall, I don't hit the ground  
As long as I fall, I'm safe and sound  
As long as I fly, I sure cannot die  
I don't need to hear the call as long as I fall  
  
Would I have time to change reality  
I would become the man, the man I could never be  
Oh, my God please tell me how to break free  
Once I was flying, flying, flying high  
I touched the sky  
  
As long as I fall, I don't hit the ground  
As long as I fall, I'm safe and sound  
As long as I fly, I sure cannot die  
I don't need to hear the call as long as I fall  
As long as I fall  
  
As long as I fall, I got no reason to care  
As long as I fall, I got no problem to bear  
I don't need to bother what I did or did not  
I would cry out in pain but  
  
As long as I fall, I don't hit the ground  
As long as I fall, I'm safe and sound  
I don't need to face no blame or disgrace  
No reason to change at all  
  
As long as I fall, I don't hit the ground  
As long as I fall, I'm safe and sound  
As long as I fly, I sure cannot die  
I don't need to hear the call as long as I fall

We can race over the mountains  
Sail over the spheres  
We can ride under the oceans  
But we can't fight our fear  
Something's wrong with the world today  
Do you know what it is?  
We believe to govern nature  
Find ways to lengthen our life  
And we go through digital stages  
Still the children cry  
Something's wrong with the world today  
Do you know what it is?  
The planet could be a better place  
If we spot the miss  
But I guess I would see a start  
I will sing it loud  
Won't you put your feet back on the ground?  
We explore the existence of aliens  
Try to conquer the space  
We refine nuclear science  
Still to die in the haze  
Something's wrong with the world today  
Do you know what it is?  
The planet could be a better place  
If we spot the miss  
But I guess I would see a start  
I will sing it loud  
Won't you put your feet back on the ground?  
Something's wrong with the world today  
Do you know what it is?  
The planet could be a better place  
If we spot the miss  
But I guess I would see a start  
Take without doubt  
Won't you put your feet back on the ground?  
(Won't you put your feet back on the ground?)  

I've been told in the name of something  
I've got to know what it means to play the game  
  
Too many faces around they're talking  
They play their parts oh, so well but who's to blame  
  
Back on the streets, that's where we are  
Building a fortress of power, yeah! We're coming  
  
You know better than me the rules are:  
Getting better or fat in the mania  
  
It's good to know who is who in our game  
The speed is faster, it's harder to see where we are  
  
Back on the streets  
  
Please Mister Know-how just bring me the news  
I'm waiting so long for you telling me all you can tell  
  
There's one thing about you, you're dying to prove  
The master plan is yours and living with knowledge is hell  
  
Back on the streets

It don't get better if you're locked behind your door  
It don't get better if you're hiding more and more  
It may get better if you fight  
It may get better if you'd wear a mask and scream  
On Halloween  
  
Come Alive  
Come Alive  
Rise and see  
Rise and be for me  
Come Alive  
Come Alive  
From the blue  
Make it true for You  
Come Alive  
  
It don't get better if you're acting for a while  
It don't get better if you drown itself denial  
It don't get better without pain  
It'd don't get better if you turn around and flee  
To ecstasy  
  
Come Alive  
Come Alive  
Rise and see  
Rise and be for me  
Come Alive  
Come Alive  
From the blue  
Make it true for You  
Come Alive

My little crazy cat  
Took a train to meet his gang downtown, yeah  
They played Black Jack  
Fritz played his false game too far, ooh  
A guy got up and started a gunfight  
  
He's looking for trouble day by day  
(For trouble, day by day)  
Don't waste time, cute runaway  
(You cute runaway)  
He kept being taken by surprise  
My stray cat in town  
  
Addicted to chicks  
He's got a rental tree near the nudist beach, yeah  
Oh watch out!  
Booze and ladies are his fate, ooh  
Too much sex and food and Rock 'n' Roll  
  
He's looking for trouble day by day

Are you waiting on something profound in your life?  
Something to touch your core?  
Making up for what seems millions of years  
Reaping the goods, but not sure...  
  
Come along, come along  
Can you see there's more?  
Not just defeat vain attempts to do things right  
More than the toil to endure each day  
Or the ache you forget and leave behind  
  
If creatures roamed the space in heaven  
They're angels, beasts, or supermen  
Do they ease attaining things  
No one believed you'd achieve?  
So once you may ascend to heaven  
Someone there has made it so  
You could be the one they've been waiting for  
  
Still running about seeking sense in your life  
What you couldn't make count before  
Taking much of your time is grieving about things  
Well, you could care less, what's that for...  
  
Come along, come along  
Can you see there's more?  
Not just defeat vain attempts to do things right  
More than the toil to endure each day  
Or the ache you forget and leave behind  
  
Come along, come along  
Can you see there's more?  
Not just defeat vain attempts to do things right  
More than the toil to endure each day  
Or the ache you forget and leave behind  
  
If creatures roamed the space in heaven  
They're angels, beasts, or supermen  
Do they ease attaining things  
No one believed you'd achieve?  
So once you may ascend to heaven  
Someone there has made it so  
You could be the one they've been waiting for

"Freedom" this cry of all slaves will be heard  
And the tyrants will feel the steel of the sword  
The chains will be broken by all slaves on the earth  
Forever to be free from their load  
  
Time has run our for all you tyrants on earth  
Your slaves are heedin' the call  
Makin' an end to all this terror and pain  
An end to your lies and your law  
  
Takin' away all your gold and your money  
Cause dead men won't need it anymore  
Much too long we felt the slash of your whips  
So now you will feel our swords  
  
Freedom the eternal cry will echo high in the sky  
The day will come when all power has been broken  
  
Your blood will flow down to the gates of hell  
Satan will wait for your souls  
Pray to your god he won't help you he's dead  
He won't fool our minds and our souls...anymore!  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Freedom the cry of all slaves will be heard  
The tyrants will now feel the steel of the sword  
The chains will be broken by all slaves on earth  
Forever to be free from their load  
  
[Chorus]  
  
...forever to be free from their load!

[Bonus track]  
  
A priest caught in lust  
Is roaming the red light  
Pays to indulge his sins  
Body cry  
Each day he awakes  
And prays for forgiveness  
"Our Father", he cries to his God  
"Set me free"  
Once we may ask for forgiveness  
Someday we could see paradise  
His words echo to his disciples  
Yet again he'll give in to his vice  
Caught and bound by temptation  
So ashamed of running free  
Sweet embrace, captivation  
Carnal truth against out beliefs  
Deliver us  
Deliver us  
His suit hides the truth  
His business is pushing  
Supplying the kings of the street  
Rich man's pride  
Higher than high, a kid passing by  
Blows off his head and escapes  
Outta sight - outta sight  
Who finds the road to redemption  
The preacher, the kid, or the man  
Who will decide it, I wonder  
Vicious circle entangled and trapped  
Caught and bound by temptation  
So ashamed of running free  
Sweet embrace, captivation  
Carnal truth against our beliefs  
Deliver us  
Deliver us  
Once we may ask for forgiveness  
Someday we could see paradise  
His words echo to his disciples  
Yet again he'll give in to his vice  
Caught and bound by temptation  
So ashamed of running free  
Sweet embrace, captivation  
Carnal truth against our beliefs  
Deliver us  
Deliver us  
Deliver us  
Deliver us

When we were lovers you called me names  
But time goes on and you were gone  
I got told you you're a big shot for the ties  
And take it from behind  
  
Now you took a new flat in a different town  
And rumors are you're wealthy now  
For that high class dress shows you earn well  
Where strangers come and go  
  
Do you feel good, do you feel fine  
Did you achieve what you had in mind  
Do you live cool, not too confined  
What can you tell this old heart of mine  
  
Some busty companion claims to know you well  
Does night shift at some place somewhere  
Said there's no one who has fun your way  
In Moscow, Rome, LA  
  
I wish, I knew  
Jolly understand  
And you never call  
  
Do you feel good, do you feel fine  
Did you achieve what you had in mind  
Do you live cool, not too confined  
What can you tell this old heart of mine  
  
Well I got no objections  
I'm old enough, you know  
But it's weird this night I seem to know you  
Better than before  
  
Do you feel good, do you feel fine  
Did you achieve what you had in mind  
Do you live cool, not too confined  
What can you tell this old heart of mine

Day by day you work off your claws  
The line of fate in them may not pay your loans  
You got to keep going and going on strive  
Day by day  
  
Do you know? Ooh, do you know? Ooh..  
  
Do you know what you're fighting for?  
The seed is sown, but we don't know the score  
They will rule us, this breed of futility  
You won't make an escape  
'Cause we will still be alive  
  
Disenchantment, alienation  
A slog to feed future, estranged generations  
And retired, will you get rewarded  
Your brave restraint?  
  
Do you know? Ooh, do you know? Ooh..  
  
Do you know what you're fighting for?  
The seed is sown, but we don't know the score  
They will rule us, this breed of futility  
You won't make an escape  
'Cause we will still be alive  
  
Do you know what you're fighting for?  
The seed is sown, but we don't know the score  
They will rule us, this breed of futility  
You won't make an escape  
'Cause we will still be alive  
  
Ooh, will they need you?  
Will they pay you?

You hide, won't fight  
Avoid the daylight  
Give in, won't win  
No try to make it right  
  
Why don't you stop crying  
Stop your painful dying  
Why don't you give your life a sense  
  
One game, one aim  
But you're always sleeping  
One light so bright  
In darkness you're creeping  
  
Why don't you use your head  
Step out of your warm bed  
And stop being on anxious rat  
  
Run, for your destination  
Fly, to the sun  
Don't give a damn what the people may say  
It's like a chain on your leg  
When you always look back  
If you don't risk anything one day you'll pay  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't run for cover  
Don't cry alone  
Make a step on your stairway  
One step closer to what you live for  
Don't run for cover  
Don't throw away  
The only chance that you got  
To be the fire in a hot life you choose  
  
No pride, no right?  
In your heart is more strength  
You know, I know  
Your destiny's in your hand  
  
Now you have this time  
To survive don't be blind  
In this world where so many can't see  
  
Bridge:  
Try, to catch the key  
Make, that you can see  
The light of your life your way to go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Run, for your destination  
Fly, to the sun  
Don't give a damn what the people may say  
It's like a chain on your leg  
When you always look back  
If you don't risk anything one day you'll pay  
  
[Chorus]

Every lie will win a prize  
Love sold by a whore  
Calculated sacrifice  
Death without a war  
Aftermath and alibis  
Straw-doll-chess to please the poor  
  
Don't tell me of any wonders shitting gold  
Don't tell me of a hard way we have to go through  
Still we pay your warmth out of the cold  
Do you really think we're that blind?  
Don't spit on my mind  
Don't spit on my mind  
Don't spit on my mind  
  
Any form of government  
Has a black sheep part  
But the brave will never know  
What the black sheeps start  
In the name of country-love  
they enrich themselves apart  
  
Don't tell me of any wonders shitting gold  
Don't tell me of a hard way we have to go through  
Still we pay your warmth out of the cold  
Do you really think we're that blind?  
Don't spit on my mind  
Don't spit on my mind  
Don't spit on my mind  
  
We are the people, we are the masses you are for  
We give the power and our desire must be your law  
Don't think I'm standing here all alone, one of a kind  
Don't think because you're still there  
Means that we are all blind  
Don't spit on my mind  
Don't spit on my mind  
Don't spit on my mind

You're the one I would pick out in a million  
You're the one I would wish for as the friend of my life  
If the whole world decided for a colour  
Would pixels be any different in you  
  
Brave and smart against the rules  
You smile upon the fools  
I follow where you go  
I want you to know  
  
Don't stop being crazy  
Wherever you go  
Don't stop being crazy  
It's a lie  
It's a lie  
It's a lie we could not learn to fly  
Oh no  
Don't stop being crazy  
  
When you walk you walk higher than the others  
When you talk you talk merciless the bothering truth  
Everybody seems remote-controlled nowadays  
Only you have a frequency far beyond their ways  
  
Still and strong you walk alone  
Don't wonder where they're gone  
I'll follow where you go  
I want you to know  
  
Don't stop being crazy  
Wherever you go  
Don't stop being crazy  
It's a lie  
It's a lie  
It's a lie we could not learn to fly  
Oh no  
Don't stop being crazy

I'm running on a dusty road  
The evil one behind me  
I hear his breath and turn around  
There's no place left to hide here  
  
Wanna break the chains of fear  
There's no way back  
Your whisper in my ear  
Your touch will save me again  
  
You'll change my dream  
You'll guide my way to be  
You are the light  
You turn black into white  
  
You'll change my dream  
You'll bring reality  
You shine so bright  
You turn black into white  
  
I've lost my soul in the game he plays  
No doubt that he won't spare me  
Hunting me, trapped in his chase  
Subject to violation  
  
I'm afraid to fall asleep  
Whether day and night  
But once I'm there in my dreams  
You'll come to save me again  
  
You'll change my dream  
You'll guide my way to be  
You are the light  
You turn black into white  
  
You'll change my dream  
You'll bring reality  
You shine so bright  
You turn black into white  
  
You'll change my dream  
You'll steer my way to be  
You are the light  
You turn black into white  
  
You'll change my dream  
You'll bring reality  
You are the light  
First star I see tonight

Up here in space  
I'm looking down on you.  
My lasers trace  
Everything you do.  
You think you've private lives  
Think nothing of the kind.  
There is no true escape  
I'm watching all the time.  
I'm made of metal  
My circuits gleam.  
I am perpetual  
I keep the country clean.  
I'm elected electric spy  
I protected electric eye.  
Always in focus  
You can't feel my stare.  
I zoom into you  
You don't know I'm there.  
I take a pride in probing all your secret moves  
My tearless retina takes pictures that can prove.  
Electric eye, in the sky  
Feel my stare, always there  
There's nothing you can do about it.  
Develop and expose  
I feed upon your every thought  
And so my power grows.  
Protected. Detective. Electric eye.

Black you stripped me  
Reveal me the secrets of your pain - painful lies?  
Life itself that feeds your wisdom  
Almost everyday you put yourself high on a shelf  
Whatever you do, wherever you go  
Never turn my back on you  
  
Shadows on the wall  
Darkness is spreading  
I warm my hands on the flames of lies  
In vain I scream against the wind  
They don't understand my last testament  
  
Escalation 666  
Escalation 666  
Escalation 666  
  
Deceit and malice  
Every smile hides betrayal and greed, hypocrisy  
We've been like brothers  
Now I hold out my hands to a bloodless, to a bloodless soul  
  
Shadows on the wall  
Darkness is spreading  
I warm my hands on the flames of lies  
In vain I scream against the wind  
They don't understand my last testament  
  
Shadows on the wall  
Darkness is spreading  
I warm my hands on the flames of lies  
In vain I scream against the wind  
They don't understand my last testament  
  
Escalation 666  
Escalation 666 (my last testament)  
Escalation 666 (my last testament)

If your body's feeling bad  
And it's the only one you have  
You want to take away the pain  
Go out walking in the rain  
You watch the flowers go to bed  
Ask the man inside your head  
Your spirit never has to grieve  
All you've got to do's believe  
The faith healer, the faith healer  
  
All you've got to do is feel  
Your body's going to start to heal  
The fingertips of holy fire,  
Everlasting sweet desire  
It never mattered  
What the doctor said  
The healer man will sail away  
It's immortality for two,  
Oh the miracles  
They will come to you  
From faith healer,the faith healer  
Can I put my hands on you?  
Can I put my hands on you?  
  
Faith, and hope, and charity,  
The simple relativity  
He can make you understand  
All you've got to take his hand  
Remember somebody said  
Ask the man inside your head  
The fingertips of holy fire,  
Everlasting sweet desire  
The faith healer, the faith healer!  
Can I put my hands on you?  
Can I put my hands on you?  
Let me put my hands on you?  
Let me put my hands on you?  
Can I put my hands on you?  
Can I put my hands on you?  
The faith healer, the faith healer...

I thought that I felt alright with my world  
But now that I knew seems taken by someone  
Probing me, waiting if I take the bait  
Surrender, step into the line  
  
We won't give into the false  
We are not as dull as taken  
Someone will hold out if they can  
They must kill us if they want us to fall  
  
When we unite  
We're falling higher  
When words collide  
We'll stand straight in turmoil and fear  
No harm coming near  
  
Hungry forever since we took a glance  
Feared that the world was taken by someone  
We realized by the look in your eyes  
Metal will never die  
  
With magic in your hands  
We are lost-and-found contenders  
For a kingdom of our stand  
Come together no surrender at all  
  
With magic in your hands  
We are lost-and-found contenders  
For a kingdom of our stand  
Come together no surrender at all  
  
When we unite  
We're falling higher  
When words collide  
We'll stand straight in turmoil and fear  
No harm coming near  
No harm coming near  
No harm coming near  
We're falling higher

We are gifted to be scared  
We need stacks of weapons to survive  
Marching for religious reasons  
Marching on and on to save our lives  
  
When will it have an end  
How can we live in harmony  
How can I understand the way things gonna be  
  
Take me far away and set my spirit higher  
Take me far away and set my soul on fire  
And I pretend to understand  
Whatever comes I'll be there for you  
  
Genetically influenced  
Is our harvest how far can we go  
Someday my own clone will come  
Take away my wife how could I know  
  
Sometimes I feel so sad  
Sometimes I could just go insane  
But when I see your smile it makes me strong again  
  
Take me far away and set my spirit higher  
Take me far away and set my soul on fire  
And I pretend to understand  
Whatever comes I'll be there for you

Can you hear - isolated  
Can you see - aberrated  
Can you sigh, I'm frustrated  
Make my day  
Can you feel animation  
Shall I bring you salvation  
No, I hate this temptation  
Make my day  
Pray, pray  
I'm afraid  
Afraid  
  
Meet you somewhere  
Far in the future  
There I will wait for you  
Far in the future  
We're gonna make it through  
I'll wait  
Wait  
  
Hear my voice, I don't care what they're saying  
Feel my touch, I think you're only sleeping  
They say you're like blind  
They say you're like dead  
Still the day will come, I may stop weeping  
  
I play you heavy metal  
Soul, punk, dance to unsettle  
One sign please, one reaction  
Make my day  
Pray, pray  
I'm afraid  
Afraid  
  
Wake up somewhere far in the future  
There I will wait for you  
Far in the future  
We're gonna make it through  
I'll wait for you  
I'll wait for you  
  
One of us is dying  
One's left behind  
Two of us are crying  
One loud and one in mind  
When your heart stops beating  
I'll go your way  
When you yet start speaking  
You made my day, day, day  
Got to pray, pray, pray  
Make my day  
Pray, pray  
I'm afraid  
Afraid  
  
Meet you somewhere far in the future  
There I will wait for you  
Far in the future  
We're gonna make it through  
Far in the future  
There hides another life  
Far in the future  
We let it all revive  
I'll wait  
Wait  
Wait

Fog in the streets  
A church clock beats  
Midnight, darkness all around  
  
You better beware  
You better take care  
Be prepared for the shock  
  
The time has come  
And he's the one  
Who's breathing down your neck  
  
Coming from behind  
Now it's your time  
A loser will die  
  
Fast as a shark he'll cut out of the dark  
He's a killer, he'll rip out your heart  
On a one way track and you're not coming back  
Because the killer is on the attack  
  
Surprise attack  
Coming from the back  
An expert of the deadly knack  
  
Just take care  
Just beware  
Be prepared for the fight  
  
Fast as a shark he'll cut out of the dark  
He's a killer, he'll rip out your heart  
On a one way track and you're not coming back  
Because the killer is on the attack  
  
Watch out, watch out  
  
Fast as a shark he'll cut out of the dark  
He's a killer - he'll rip out your heart  
On a one way track and you're not coming back  
Because the killer is on the attack  
  
Fast as a shark he'll cut out of the dark  
He's a killer, he'll rip out your heart  
On a one way track and you're not coming back  
Because the killer's  
Because the killer's  
Because the killer's on the attack

Why you come tonight to take my live?  
I know one day it's time to go  
Why don't you give me one more chance?  
I know that I can try to die another time  
Don't wait for me, I'm gonna stay  
Because there's much more to get clear  
  
You are always on time  
Patiently you wait for me  
But you know I'm always too late  
Try another day  
  
I don't know where to go  
When the time has come for me  
Is it heaven or hell?  
Well you'll tell me again  
Tell I know what to do  
In the endless shades of space  
Is it heaven or hell?  
You will tell me again  
To find my freedom  
  
Hey, come on  
Go date an other mate  
I bade you once ago to go  
But now you're back too soon again  
You said that I could pay  
When all my fear would stay away  
Instead my life is high and dry  
I'm still afraid to die  
  
You are always on time  
Patiently you wait for me  
But you know I'm always too late  
Come another day  
  
I don't know where to go  
When the time has come for me  
Is it heaven or hell?  
Well you'll tell me again  
Tell I know what to do  
In the endless shades of space  
Is it heaven or hell?  
You will tell me again  
To find my freedom  
Everlasting freedom

Will your first time  
Will it be  
I think of someone like me?  
Makes me wonder  
I can show you things  
You'd never thought you'd see  
You're like sunshine  
I can feel your heat is drying out my brain  
Would you feel like  
Like we're having fun if I can do the rain?  
Have you thought of your dreams  
Do you have some?  
Let's see if we can find some more  
Give me your fancies at random  
I think we can deal with 'em all  
I can't wait forever  
Baby open me your door  
I just want your loving  
If you cannot give me more  
I can see you standing there  
You know you're worth the try  
Let me guide you in my spaceship  
And I'll surely make you  
Have a real good time  
Don't waste time now  
You are soakin' wet so fix  
The things you got  
Guess you know how  
And when you're done  
I gotta see you strut  
My desire  
Can I watch you rock and  
Know which one to choose?  
I'm no liar  
I could take you down  
And you got nothing to lose  
I don't know any better occasion  
Can't hold back, it's the end of the day  
I don't think you're here for the first time  
No problem with me anyway  
I can't wait forever  
Baby open me your door  
I just want your loving  
If you cannot give me more  
I can see you standing there  
I know we have a try  
I can feel this night is special  
And I surely make  
You have a real good time  
I can't leave you standing there  
You know we have a try  
I can feel this night is special  
And I'll surely make  
you have a real good time

What can I do?  
Will I be getting through?  
Now that I must try  
To leave it all behind  
  
Did you see  
What you have done to me  
So hard to justify  
Slowly is passing by  
  
Forever and one  
I will miss you  
However, I kiss you  
Yet again  
Way down in Neverland  
So hard I was trying  
Tomorrow I'll still be crying  
How could you hide  
Your lies, your lies  
  
Here I am  
Seeing you once again  
My mind's so far away  
My heart's so close  
To stay  
Too proud to fight  
I'm walking back into night  
Will I ever find  
Someone to believe?  
  
Forever and one  
I will miss you  
However, I kiss you  
Yet again  
Way down in Neverland  
So hard I was trying  
Tomorrow I'll still be crying  
How could you hide your lies  
Your lies

What can I do?  
Will I be getting through?  
Now that I must try  
To leave it all behind  
  
Did you see  
What you have done to me  
So hard to justify  
Slowly is passing by  
  
Forever and one  
I will miss you  
However, I kiss you  
Yet again  
Way down in Neverland  
So hard I was trying  
Tomorrow I'll still be crying  
How could you hide  
Your lies, your lies  
  
Here I am  
Seeing you once again  
My mind's so far away  
My heart's so close  
to stay  
Too proud to fight  
I'm walking back into night  
Will I ever find  
Someone to believe?  
  
Forever and one  
I will miss you  
However, I kiss you  
Yet again  
Way down in Neverland  
So hard I was trying  
Tomorrow I'll still be crying  
How could you hide your lies  
Your lies

Tossed into my mind, stirring the calm  
You splash me with beauty and pull me down  
You come from out of nowhere  
My glance turns to a stare  
Obsession rules me I'm yours from the start  
I know you see me our eyes interlock  
You come from out of nowhere  
My glance turns to a stare  
One minute here and one minute there  
Don't know if I'll laugh or cry  
One minute here and one minute there  
And then you wave good-bye  
Sifting to the bottom, every day for two  
All energy funnels, all becomes you  
You come from out of nowhere  
My glance turns to a stare  
One minute here and one minute there  
Don't know if I'll laugh or cry  
One minute here and one minute there  
And it hurts inside  
One minute here and one minute there  
And then you wave good-bye

If you're out there all alone  
And you don't know where to go to  
Come and take a trip with me  
To Future World  
  
And if you're running through your life  
And you don't know what the sense is  
Come and look how it could be in Future World  
  
We all live in happiness our life is full of joy  
We say the word "tomorrow" without fear  
The feeling of togetherness is always at our side  
We love our life and we know we will stay  
  
'Cause we all live  
In Future World  
A world that's full of love  
  
Our future life will  
Be glorious  
Come with me future world  
  
You say you'd like to stay  
But this is not your time  
Go back, find your own way to Future World  
  
Life can be for living  
Just try and never give in  
Tell everyone the way to Future World  
  
One day you'll live in happiness  
With a heart that's full of joy  
You'll say the word "tomorrow" without fear  
The feeling of togetherness will I be at your side  
You'll say you love your life and you'll know why  
  
'Cause we all live in future world  
A world that's full of love  
Our future life will be glorious  
Come with me future world  
  
Scream it out  
  
'Cause we all live in future world  
A world that's full of love  
Our future life will  
Be glorious Come with me future world

A little thing you sure will know  
Why you came here tonight  
And not to those other places  
I could imagine there's PCs and DVDs  
And TV shows  
And sex in cars what else you like  
Now right here is the place I got to be  
Tomorrow I'll be far away  
If you got time and nothing else to do now  
Together we can change the world  
  
Lets get it up  
Rock's here to stay  
With the best years of our lives we paid our share,  
Yeah, yeah  
Now tell me what is in our way  
To push this right in the face every day  
  
We spread it further, on the town  
Now, what d'ya know we're good  
To incite a few more disciples  
No tie to waste makin' haste we're movin' on  
Where we'll suspend another night  
  
Do I see grinning faces all round here?  
And is this due to my words  
Come treat me nice, why'know, I wasn't raised here  
But I mean everything I say  
  
Lets get it up  
Rock's here to stay  
With the best years of our lives  
We paid our share yeah yeah  
Now tell me what is in our way  
To push this right in the face everyday

I can't tell you how it happened  
So I guess we'll never know  
I'm always late and running out of time  
So I must be very slow  
  
Someone must have smoked too much  
Or is it only dust  
My pals just tend to leave here in disgust  
  
My flat is a mess same as ever before  
My suits they stink like you don't want to know  
Junk to the left, trash to the right  
Get me out of here I can't take it anymore  
  
When the postman rings I stay in bed  
I never make it down  
My fridge must be alive inside  
It's uttering funny sounds  
If I don't know what time it is  
I peek out if there's sun  
No use anyway, my money's gone  
  
My flat is a mess same as ever before  
My suits they stink like you don't want to know  
Junk to the left, trash to the right  
Get me out of here I can't take it anymore  
Get me out of here I can't take it anymore

Strong and invincible  
They know every rule  
Seems inconceivable  
Anything they do  
  
They made us their slaves  
We weren't unified  
Ever since we paid  
For selling our lives  
  
Someday, someway, I may see a wonderland  
Don't you, won't you say that we''ll be free again  
  
Deprived of our consciousness  
We can't predict what's more  
Can you remember how  
Things used to be before?  
  
I secretly dream  
Of things we will be taught  
Will someone esteem  
For those who have fought?  
  
(Solo)  
  
Strong and invincible  
They know every rule  
Seems inconceivable  
Anything they do  
  
Deep in our hearts  
We hope our dreams come true  
The only thing is  
What are we to do?  
  
Won't you say it  
Can't you feel it?

Masquerade, masquerade,  
Grab your mask and don't be late  
Get out get out well disguised  
Heat and fever in the air tonight  
  
Meet the others at the store,  
Knock on other people's door  
Trick or treat they have the choice  
little ghost's are makin'lotsa noise  
  
But watch out beware  
listen take care  
  
In the streets on Halloween  
There's something going on  
No way to escape the power unknown  
In the streets on Halloween  
The spirits will arise  
Make your choice, it's hell or paradise  
Ah it's Halloween  
Ah it's Halloween tonight!  
  
Someone's sitting in a field,  
Never giving yield  
Sitting there with gleaming eyes  
Waiting for big pumpkin to arise  
Bad luck if you get a stone  
Like the good old Charlie Brown  
You think Linus could be right  
The kids will say it's just a stupid lie  
  
But watch out beware  
listen take care  
  
In the streets on Halloween  
There's something going on  
No way to escape the power unknown  
In the streets on Halloween  
The spirits will arise  
Make your choice, it's hell or paradise  
Ah it's Halloween  
Ah it's Halloween tonight!  
  
Listen now we are calling yo  
And there's magic in the air  
Magic in the air on Halloween  
  
Black is the night full of fright  
You'll be missing the day  
What will be here very soon  
Changing your way  
A knock at your door  
Is it real or is it a dream  
On trembling legs you open the door  
And you scream on Halloween  
  
Darkness  
Where am I now  
Is there anybody out there  
What has happened  
Am I in heaven  
Or is it hell  
  
I can see a Light comin'  
It's comin' nearer  
It's shining  
It's shining so bright  
It's shining on me  
  
I am the one, doom 's in my hands  
Now make your choice,  
redeemed or enslaved  
  
I'll show you passion and glory  
He Is the snake  
I'll give you power and abundance  
He's the corrupter of man  
  
Save me from the evil one  
Give me strength to carry on  
I will fight for all mankind's  
deliverance and peace of mind  
  
But watch out beware  
listen take care  
  
In the streets on Halloween  
There's something going on  
No way to escape the power unknown  
In the streets on Halloween  
The spirits will arise  
Make your choice, it's hell or paradise  
Ah it's Halloween  
Ah it's Halloween tonight!  
  
Yeah, it's Halloween  
Yeah, it's Halloween tonight

I could go a step ahead and try  
Harder than before but I deny  
Always when I try a step  
Something's gonna hold me back  
  
Back to where I started  
I just bump my head instead  
Better leave me here all on my own  
Better leave me or become my clone  
  
Everyone who grabbed my hand  
Fell into the same wasteland  
Don't try to convince me  
With your optimistic smile  
  
I'd need a shotgun in my dreams tonight  
To terminate my rotten side  
Just need one shot into the center of my hate  
To light the darkness and run free from that old spell  
  
I don't know if hell or paradise  
Belong together or if heaven tells no lies  
You role the dice, you know the price  
Is higher than you can afford  
  
Beware of what you might see  
Can you trust your blinded eyes?  
I don't know if heaven tells no lies  
  
Black is white and colors turn to gray  
What was close is drifting far away  
Just now right's already wrong  
What turns weak was never strong  
Can I kill the demon without blowing out my mind?  
  
I'd need a shotgun in my dreams tonight  
To terminate my rotten side  
Just need one shot into the center of my hate  
To light the darkness and run free from that old spell  
  
I don't know if hell or paradise  
Belong together or if heaven tells no lies  
You role the dice, you know the price  
Is higher than you can afford  
  
Beware of what you might see  
Can you trust your blinded eyes?  
I don't know if heaven tells no lies  
  
I will return, you have to burn  
Abide my vision, you no longer keep me bound  
I will be back, I will attack  
In my religion I will make you hell hound drown

Fight hard  
Live fast  
Play loud  
Step out of the crowd  
  
Iron  
Rulin'  
Steel bent  
Forever the faith will live on in our hearts  
  
There's nothing else in all the world  
That will bring it down  
We will play our wildest step to all around  
We need it as a liquid in our veins instead of blood  
  
Power  
Burnin'  
Brains out  
United metallians ready to strike  
  
White heat  
Red hot  
Mayhem  
If you don't feel it you won't understand  
  
There's nothing else in all the world  
That will bring it down  
We will play our wildest step to all around  
We need it as a liquid in our veins instead of blood  
  
Chorusheavy metal is the law that keeps us all united free  
A law that shatters earth and hell  
Heavy metal can't be beaten by any dynasty  
We're all wizards fightin' with our spell  
  
Chorus

There are some fellows soft and mellow  
Sitting in the field and play like hell  
No one knows the way it goes  
But all the songs they play they sound so well  
  
Tonight we go to see the Heavy Metal Hamsters  
It must feel nice to be a Heavy Metal Hamster  
Nothing sets you free like our Heavy Metal Hamsters  
  
A 20th century Fox came by  
A gold tipped cigarette high in his jaws  
Contracts, PDs, Nose-Bags, TV-shows  
And everything with no remorse  
  
Things are settled now for our Heavy Metal Hamsters  
Fame up to your brows, oh Heavy Metal Hamster  
A previously unknown lifestyle Heavy Metal Hamster  
  
The sweet taste of success is strong  
And everything inside goes wrong you see  
With coloured furs, sunglasses  
Tons of nuts to eat, they don't feel free  
  
What is wrong with our Heavy Metal Hamster?  
Look what they have done our Heavy Metal Hamsters  
Where is the field to run for our Heavy Metal Hamsters  
Some things are left undone for our Heavy Metal Hamsters

There was a time eating your mind  
Eating your heart and your soul  
Down to the bone always alone  
Nobody waiting at home  
  
Now allow that we unite our fires  
Shout it out  
Give yourself to me  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
Hell was made in heaven  
I was made for you  
Hell was made in heaven  
Made for loving you in sin  
  
Ten years ago you made the vow  
Promised your life and your love  
Before you have paid, nothing returned  
What is enough is enough  
  
Now allow that we unite our fires  
Shout it out  
Give yourself to me  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
Hell was made in heaven  
I was made for you  
Hell was made in heaven  
Made for loving you in sin  
  
Now allow that we unite our fires  
Shout it out  
Give yourself to me  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
Hell was made in heaven  
I was made for you  
Hell was made in heaven  
Made for loving you in sin, in sin  
In sin, in sin

Look, the homeless on the street  
The little shoeblack on his knees  
A good heart and the daily fighter  
Policemen, gangster and the priest  
Wheelchair woman on her feet  
Chinese smoker with his dragon lighter  
  
They're all fighting through their lives  
Against their enemies  
Reaching out for the light  
  
Everyone can be a hero  
We are, we are  
Sometimes up then down to zero  
We are, we are  
Heroes, heroes  
  
Look this old man's only teeth  
When he smiles underneath  
Searching for some food on the ground  
The musician at the store  
Selling his guitar for naught  
It's rent that matters not the sound  
  
They're all fighting through their lives  
Against their enemies  
Reaching out for the light  
  
Everyone can be a hero  
We are, we are  
Sometimes up then down to zero  
We are, we are  
Heroes  
  
Everyone can be a hero  
We are, we are  
Sometimes up then down to zero  
We are, we are  
Heroes  
Everyone can be a hero  
We are, we are  
Sometimes up then down to zero  
We are, we are  
Heroes, heroes

I saw it walkin' lonely down the street  
Cool like the cat, like crazy dream  
I looked twice again, I can't believe  
It turned around right then  
And looked at me  
I said oh no, it really couldn't be  
It was a man, it was a woman, too  
  
He's a woman, she's a man  
He's a woman, she's a (woman)  
  
I think it really came from far away  
I'm feeling head uptight so I have to stay  
It takes my hand and says come on, let's go  
We're goin' home, she asked me to stay  
He starts to move, she starts to play  
I need a body, why not you  
  
He's a woman, she's a man  
He's a woman, she's a (woman)

Alright  
I remember the day that we met  
I needed someone you needed someone too, yeah  
Spent time taking all you could get  
Even yourself was one thing you never could do, oh yeah  
You played with my heart  
You played with my head  
I've got to laugh when I think  
All the things you said  
'Cause I stole your love  
Stole your love  
Ain't never gonna let you go  
I stole your love  
Stole your love  
I stole your love  
You never stop running around  
You pick me up and say you want some of me down  
You were the girl that nobody could own  
You stay for a while and then you would leave me alone  
But I'm something different  
Ain't like the rest  
How does it feel  
To find out your failing your test?  
'Cause I stole your love  
Stole your love  
Ain't never gonna let you go  
I stole your love  
Stole your love  
I stole your love  
Listen, I stole your love  
Stole your love  
Ain't never gonna let you go  
I stole your love  
Stole your love  
I stole your love  
I stole your love  
Stole your love  
I stole your love  
I stole your love  
Stole your love  
I stole your love, come on  
I stole your love  

Ticking, ticking, ticking  
Always counting right down  
The clock strikes ten  
You still wear your old gown  
Come on, come on, come on  
Get the hell up and stay  
Alert and strong  
Try to find your right way  
  
People say it's wrong  
People say it's bad  
Others say that god's a little mad  
Secretly he'd wear the black, you know  
  
If god loves rock 'n' roll  
I'd better protect my soul  
'Cause heaven seems to be  
The place I wanna be  
If god loves rock 'n' roll  
I'd better reset my goal  
Do everything I can  
To be a rocking man  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
Leather suits you better  
Got to let your hair grow  
Take the black and enjoy the new show  
Welcome to an army spreading over the world  
Wild and proud brothers  
Haven't you heard?  
  
People say it's wrong  
People say it's bad  
Others say that god's a little mad  
Secretly he'd wear the black, you know  
  
If god loves rock 'n' roll  
I'd better protect my soul  
'Cause heaven seems to be  
The place I wanna be  
If god loves rock 'n' roll  
I'd better reset my goal  
Do everything I can  
To be a rocking man  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
If god loves rock 'n' roll  
Even in heaven you need a bass guitar  
A guitar and a second guitar  
Here we go...  
  
If god loves rock 'n' roll  
I'd better protect my soul  
'Cause heaven seems to be  
The place I wanna be  
If god loves rock 'n' roll  
I'd better reset my goal  
Do everything I can  
To be a rocking man  
  
If god loves rock 'n' roll  
If god loves rock 'n' roll  
If god loves rock 'n' roll

No fear, no pain  
Nobody left to blame  
I'll try alone  
Make destiny my own  
I learn to free my mind  
Myself I now must find  
Once more  
Once more  
  
If I could fly  
Like the king of the sky  
Could not tumble nor fall  
I would picture it all  
If I could fly  
See the world through my eyes  
Would not stumble nor fail  
To the heavens I sail  
If I could fly  
  
So here I am  
In solitude I stand  
I've got dreams inside  
I need to realize  
My faith has grown  
No fear of the unknown  
No more  
No more  
  
If I could fly  
Like the king of the sky  
Could not tumble nor fall  
I would picture it all  
If I could fly  
See the world through my eyes  
Would not stumble nor fail  
I could ravage my jail  
If I could fly

(m - grosskopf, l - kiske)  
  
Thunder, flash and lightning  
Is working on my back  
The tables in the kitchen  
Are tryin' to break my neck  
  
All the late night memories  
Are leaning in my shoes  
My mother's old grey  
Leather gloves are singing loud the blues  
  
I can taste what's in the sun  
No time to waste 'cause there is none  
When I feel blue I see it shine  
But still it's true I'm doin' fine  
  
You can't see me  
'cause now I'm all free  
Now you know I'm through  
An' all that's not new  
  
Sitting on a paperback  
'cause I don't know what really cracks  
I'm trying to climb my pencil  
To get high  
  
No one tells me what to do  
'cause no one knows what I've been through  
You don't know a thing  
But you can learn  
  
It's time to touch the sky  
My mind is free I fly  
  
I can taste what's in the sun  
No time to waste 'cause there is none  
When I feel blue I see it shine  
But still it's true I'm doin' fine  
  
You can't see me  
'cause now I'm all free  
Now you know I'm through  
An' all that's not new

I'm free, as free as one can be  
In a world that cries for more equality  
I'm free, as free as one can be  
In this world so full of tears and misery  
Today  
  
Faster and faster we run into life, no time for emotions  
Higher and higher we raise our limits too fast  
Lost with protectors and will to survive, it's an illusion  
Colder and colder it gets as we walk down the line  
  
I don't wanna be a part  
Of that foolish game  
I just try another start  
Nothing stays the same  
  
I'm free, as free as one can be  
In a world that cries for more equality  
I'm free, as free as one can be  
In this world so full of tears and misery  
Today  
  
Stronger and stronger we march into thy  
Don't show no weakness  
Don't show no mercy for those who are allied in pain  
Stay where you are no complaining at all  
  
Never get restless  
Never just step out of line cause it won't be the same  
  
I don't wanna be a part  
Of that foolish game  
I just try another start  
Or else I go insane  
  
I'm free, as free as one can be  
In a world that cries for more equality  
I'm free, as free as one can be  
In this world so full of tears and misery  
Today  
  
I'm free, as free as one can be  
In a world that cries for more equality  
I'm free, as free as one can be  
In this world so full of tears and misery  
Today  
Today  
Today  
Today

Tell me prety girl do you know who I am?  
Have you ever seen me as your friend  
Anything we have is those hungry nights  
But there's so much left unsatisfied  
  
All those little things you told me  
Ain't good enought to show me  
That we're gonna make in through the time  
  
I found out in the middle of a heartbeat  
And I know that i'm doin' right  
Together we are still so far apart  
I found out in the middle of a heartbeat  
And the more I try to be your light  
I can't get any closer to your heart  
  
Now that I'm afraid just to ask for more  
I'm still waiting as I did before  
If you only sad that it's not too late  
We could then rely upon our fate  
  
All those little things you tell me  
Could bear enought to show me  
That we're gonna make in through the time  
  
I found out in the middle of a heartbeat  
And I know that i'm tellin' right  
Together we are still so far apart  
I found out in the middle of a heartbeat  
That the more I try to be your light  
I can't get any closer to your heart  
  
To your heart  
  
I found out, I found out  
  
I found out in the middle of a heartbeat  
And I know that i'm doin' right  
Together we are still so far apart  
I found out in the middle of a heartbeat  
And the more I try to be your light  
I can't get any closer to your heart  
  
I found out in the middle of a heartbeat  
And i know that i'm doin' right  
Together we are still so far apart  
Together we are still so far apart

In the night I'm calling you!  
Be my guide help me through!  
In the night I call your name  
You're the light in times of shame!  
The songs I sing  
All my love I bring for you!  
  
I always try to make things better  
Everything that has gone wrong  
Mighty plans in the right direction  
But very little has been done  
Everyday when I try to get forward  
I find myself another mile back  
Help me fighting!  
Help me breathing!  
Why am I falling down instead?  
  
Every useful minute seems to be the thought of you  
Every hour seems like wasted, filled with things that I might do  
Without love in my reactions seems the saddest thing, but's true!  
  
In the night  
Sometimes I cried after all I lied to you  
  
Free from ourselves and free from this world we may find  
The freedom we search  
'Cause all that we need is inside!  
The hours we waste we may not get back for a while  
And when it gets dark  
No chance will be there for a try  
  
When I wake up early in the morning  
I catch a book and jump inside  
I fill my head with a million wonders  
And try to fill the night with light  
The moment when I get things clearer  
I see another mountain to climb  
And always when I think I'm nearer  
I realize there is no time  
  
In the night  
This song I sing, all my love I bring for you!

You promise us a bright golden future  
You say you will save the world  
That there will be no more hunger and pain  
But we only see your golden hands  
  
You say you take care of our survival  
Sending us missiles instead  
But you just betray us, deny us and lie  
And you always say you would  
  
Fight for freedom, fight for rights  
I see treason in your eyes.  
  
Judas - rulin' with an iron hand  
Judas - sittin' in the government  
Judas - I am not a Jesus Christ  
Judas - you will be the one who's crucified  
  
Your worship money and economy  
There's nothing that you wouldn't do  
If the payment is right you don't care about life  
'Cause economy is your truth  
  
You are the one selling terror and pain  
In all the parts of the world  
You are preparing the final grand slam  
But you keep on tellin' you'll  
  
Fight for freedom, fight for rights  
I see treason in your eyes.  
  
Judas - rulin' with an iron hand  
Judas - sittin' in the government  
Judas - I am not a Jesus Christ  
Judas - you will be the one who's crucified  
  
Judas, Judas - are you still human?  
Judas, Judas - I can't believe it  
Judas, Judas - dealing with evil  
Judas, Judas  
You'll keep on telling you'll  
  
Fight for freedom, fight for rights  
I see treason in your eyes.  
  
Judas - rulin' with an iron hand  
Judas - sittin' in the government  
Judas - I am not a Jesus Christ  
Judas - you will be the one who's crucified  
  
Judas - rulin' with an iron hand  
Judas - sittin' in the government  
Judas - I am not a Jesus Christ  
Judas - you will be the one who's crucified

Here I stand alone again  
Hundreds all around  
Didn't come here to make a friend  
But to listen to the sound  
Something's growing in my pants  
As she looks into my eyes  
Now I smile the whole damn night  
But my dream acts cold as ice  
  
It's time for just a little sign  
It's time, make believe the world is mine  
It's time for just a little sign  
It's time, make believe the world is mine  
Just a little sign  
  
Shouldn't I dare to talk to her  
But what is it I would say  
Surely I'd look like a clown  
For my smiles freeze on my face  
  
It's time for just a little sign  
It's time, make believe the world is mine  
It's time for just a little sign  
It's time, make believe the world is mine  
Just a little sign

We poison our hearts  
We poison our seas  
We burn down the paradise  
  
We're stoppin' good waves  
We're losin' our trees  
The future looks bright ahead  
I don't wonder we'll go under in this river of lies  
  
We're lost in this time--we create so fine  
The future we already fear  
Seems like no way out, seems like there's no doubt  
The future looks bright ahead  
  
We're the kids of the century--we're lost in our games  
No time for the memories we look in the haze  
We're the kids of the century it wasn't our fault  
Everything's done mum, we fall  
Let's keep on crying  
But sometimes I don't want to fall  
  
Everytime when you look around things will smile at you  
Everytime when you turn around you smell the truth  
But you run away from the lies you can't say  
Don't run away from the lies you can't say  
  
We're the kids

I'm your maker  
Mold your mind  
Idea-creator  
Bias from behind  
  
People never wonder  
How the world goes round  
They who care go under  
That's what I'm about  
  
I kill it, kill it, kill it  
Kill it, kill it  
Care must die  
Kill it, kill it, kill it  
What we can't tie  
What we can't buy  
Must die  
  
I'm soul hunter  
Of the might  
Upright hatemonger  
Angel of the blind  
  
People never wonder  
How the world goes round  
They who care go under  
That's what I'm about  
  
I kill it, kill it, kill it  
Kill it, kill it  
Care must die  
Kill it, kill it, kill it  
  
People never wonder  
How the world goes round  
They who know must follow  
They who don't die bound  
  
I pay billions  
All got a price  
Plain corruption  
No roll of the dice  
  
People never wonder  
How the world goes round  
They who care go under  
That's what I'm about  
  
I kill it, kill it, kill it  
Kill it, kill it  
Care must die  
Kill it, kill it, kill it  
What we can't tie  
What we can't buy  
Must die

[Jethro Tull]  
  
In the shuffling madness  
Of the locomotive breath  
Runs the all time loser  
Headlong to his death  
And he feels the piston scraping  
Steam breaking on his brow  
Old Charlie stole the handle  
And the train, it won't stop going  
No way to slow down, oh  
  
He sees his children jumping off  
At stations one by one  
His woman and his best friend  
In bed and having fun  
And oh, he's crawling down the corridor  
On his hands and knees  
Old Charlie stole the handle  
And the train, it won't stop going  
No way to slow down, oh  
No way to slow down  
  
He hears the silence howling  
When he catches angels as they fall  
And the all time winner  
Has got him by the balls  
Oh, and he picks up Gideon's Bible  
And it's open at page one  
I think God, he stole the handle  
And the train, it won't stop going  
  
No way to slow down  
No way to slow down  
No way to slow down  
No way to slow down

I wait in the cold  
It should have been summer  
It will start to rain  
It's just not fair  
But we are insane  
We wait for the thunder  
We wait for the pain  
With open hair  
Now the stage is on fire  
Now explodes the air  
  
Ohohohohohohoh  
Ohohohohohohoh  
  
Long live the king  
Long live the king  
  
We shout every line  
We bang to the metal  
Some call out his name  
He makes the sign  
Now the stage is on fire  
Now explodes the air  
  
Ohohohohohohoh  
Ohohohohohohoh  
  
Long live the king  
Long live the king  
  
You got to feel the spirit  
Got to hear the Les Paul  
You got to feel the action  
Got to ride the death wall  
  
Giving in it  
Giving in it  
Giving in it all  
Giving in it  
Giving in it  
Giving in it all  
  
The curtain is down  
We scream like one choir  
Emotions go wild  
I shake my hair  
Now the stage is on fire  
Now explodes the air  
  
Ohohohohohohoh  
Ohohohohohohoh  
  
Long live the king  
Long live the king

Feelings come and go, I've never known  
Something longs to grow, won't let go  
Spirits 'round my head, are whispering  
I turn inside instead, a-wondering  
  
Deep inside of me, I know there's got to be  
A different kind of truth, that sets the spirit free  
If I don't want to know, what's written inside me  
How could I see anything, how could I be anything?  
  
Restless minds have searched, long before  
The truth will be the same, for evermore  
The mightiness of trees, that you can feel  
Can give you all you need, just listen still  
  
Here is love and there is pain  
It's all around, it's all the same  
There's nothing new that I could tell to you  
  
But still there is the universe inside of us that never bursts  
We might not know the meaning yet, but I'm sure we can't reject  
The truth that is in everything, that is and has been and will be  
  
There is a long way to go, there is a high place to know  
There is a world to go through, but there's so much more to do  
Until we're home!  
  
Deep inside of me, I know there's  
  
Feelings come and go, I've never known

Here is all mankind so proud of their achievements  
There is a stone that is warmer than you  
  
Look how we stand in the stream of illusions  
No one says a word  
  
Here you laugh and there you cry  
All that makes you move  
  
There's no fear for anything  
Anything but you  
  
Animals dying for our vanity  
Our world is a beautiful place to be free  
  
Drinking the blood of the weak, it's so easy  
No one hears them cry  
  
Here you cheat and there you lie  
All that makes you gain  
  
One day we will face His throne  
There's nothin' we can say  
  
Prosperity, luxury, fast food is rising  
It's the rainforest that dies  
  
Here you laugh and there you cry  
All that makes you move  
  
Here you cheat and there you lie  
All that makes you gain

Fool moon standing in the streets  
I know the time is near  
Incarnate power roaring from the sky  
Unrelenting forces blasting through the air  
Roaring thunder lift your hands and pray  
  
Running through the empty streets they're looking for the fight  
Swords gleam in the light of moon the gods prepare to strike  
  
[Chorus]  
Metal invaders, ready to strike  
A warning from hell, be careful tonight  
  
Dark night overwhelming bright light  
See the demons fly  
Can't trust your senses fear you'll have to die  
Super mighty shadows casting amplitudes to ears  
Sounds you've never heard that take you high  
  
Time has come for them to rise, invasion is their doom  
Riding high on iron horses in the light of moon  
  
[Chorus]  
Metal invaders, the gods on their ride  
Sworn to bring metal, mayhem tonight

Chico Fernandez, sleepin' on his gun  
Dreams of Santa Anna  
Fighting in the sun  
Drums so loud from both sides  
Makes it hard to dream  
A bluish fall on an orange fast  
Makes that hard to seems reason  
  
Mornin', calm mornin'  
Ah, Chico's gonna have his share  
Mornin', sad mornin'  
Sad it must be Aahahahahahahahahahaha...  
Mornin', sad mornin'  
Me-xi-ca-an!!!  
  
Seniorita panned in:  
Chico, come-on-home!  
Santa Anna's losing  
You'll be the first to go  
Sam Whosman's laughin'  
Davy Crocket too  
Whenn Anna takes the Alamo  
The first to go is you  
  
Mornin', calm mornin'  
Ah, Chico's gonna have his share  
Mornin', sad mornin'  
Heaven will be there  
Aahahahahahahahahahaha  
Mornin', sad mornin'  
Me-xi-ca-an!!!

So far from our system we came here through space  
To leave poisoned spheres for your race  
Our knowledge we trade for the time shared on earth  
To take and give for what it's worth  
  
On, our screens we've been shown your world  
Plead for your welcome, you won't get hurt  
  
Mission motherland  
Another chance  
With sunlit soil and air to breathe  
Is there any place for us to live  
To grow descendants  
To be free  
  
You gave us resources  
You gave us advice  
To deal with the unknown to get humanized  
We've shown you dimensions and brought you on ways  
You've never seen yesterday  
  
Hand in hand we will march through time  
So much more to research and find  
  
Mission motherland  
Another chance  
With sunlit soil and air to breathe  
Is there any place for us to live  
To grow descendants  
To be free  
  
When you hear these words  
We've taken cold refuge  
In freezers to keep us alive  
What we didn't know  
Your central star called sun  
Sends lethal rays to earth  
Say how many of us died  
In the streams of light  
Faceless bodies, morbid cries  
Doomed our colonies  
Wake us when you've healed the world  
Save our souls  
  
When will we be as one again  
And fulfill what we understand as  
  
Mission motherland  
Another chance  
With sunlit soil and air to breathe  
Is there any place for us to live  
To grow descendants  
To be free

Take me down  
To the ground  
Just let me feel it  
If I let someone down  
Please welcome  
Him on the losing side  
I shake you off  
And make my choice  
Don't wanna hear you  
Your slimy voice  
Please go down, please  
I don't wanna feel you around me  
  
Take me down to a higher ground  
To survive your mindless sound  
If you know all the people  
Why are you alone?  
If you know all the people  
You'll be goin' down  
  
I feel that man  
On my back  
Don't promise any crap  
Someone will break your neck  
You don't know how  
To soak my soul  
Let me out  
Let me go  
Open your eyes  
You told nothing but lies  
Please go down, please  
C'mon, go down with your ego  
  
Take me down to a higher ground  
To survive your mindless sound  
If you know all the people  
Why are you alone?  
If you know all the people  
You'll be goin' down  
  
Let me go ahead, let me go  
  
I will find an explanation  
Where's my only destination  
Separated ways now and forever  
Is the only and only measure  
Tales full of exaggerations  
No more manipulations  
And I think you are not funny  
Your brain is just a bloated dummy  
  
Take me down to a higher ground  
To survive your mindless sound  
If you know all the people  
Why are you alone?  
If you know all the people  
You'll be goin' down

Mrs. God, am I right  
That's your real address  
This time, it's you  
Ready to confess  
Free the masculine world  
Cancel their humility  
  
Mrs God, can it be  
Can You be the light  
One dressed to kill  
  
Walk on, how you bite  
This will state and explain  
Why men are sometimes stumbling  
  
Mrs God, are You there  
Laughing at us is not fair  
Mrs God can You see  
All the shit You've done to me  
  
Mrs. God, may I say  
It's nothing of my kind  
We're so deceived  
You'd better left us blind  
  
Mrs God, we are cool  
Take it with the smile  
But don't be cruel  
That's heavy to defy  
In some hundred years  
God has always had the tears

He said get out of here nobody wants you here  
You smashed his head and the man died  
And there's a murmur loud  
From the appearing crowd  
Searching for motives and reasons why  
  
Now take a look at yourself and you'll see  
What you are in the eyes of the world  
You didn't want it but now he's dead  
And you're on the run from the law  
  
You're a murderer, in every town  
Murderer, to the whole world  
Murderer, you're on the run  
Murderer, you'll have to kill again!  
  
And like an animal which escaped from the cage  
They're hunting you over their holy land  
Traps waiting everywhere you fall in deep despair  
Darkness and night your only friends  
  
One day the chase will be over for you  
And you'll find your own peace in the end  
Some day you will find sanctuary  
Death!But so long my friend!  
  
You're a murderer, in every town  
Murderer, to the whole world  
Murderer, you're on the run  
Murderer, you'll have to kill again!  
  
You're a murderer, in every town  
Murderer, to the whole world  
Murderer, you're on the run  
Murderer, you'll have to kill again!  
  
Look for a safe place where no one will find you  
And try to escape from the law  
Wherever you are there's a killer behind you  
Wanting to get you for sure  
To lose the fear that one day he will get you  
Be faster and kill him and run  
Now you don't have to fear him no more  
But in his place another headhunter will come  
Run away!

Why should i wait, what is left there for me?  
I come to claim  
To win the game  
Why should i plea for my fair and right move?  
I come to play  
I come to stay  
  
I don't wanna bitch around no more  
I don't wanna stand back anymore  
  
Its my god-given right  
To stand and fight  
For what i like  
It's my god-given brain  
That cried in pain  
Would i resign  
There's nothing to gain  
If i would restrain  
There's nothing to find  
If i stay behind  
It's my right  
My god-given right  
  
Why should i lose if i am meant to win?  
I know i can  
I've got a plan  
All that they told me is right and so wrong  
I went through schools  
Found my own rules  
  
I don't wanna bitch around no more  
I don't wanna stand back anymore  
  
It's my god-given right  
To stand and fight  
For what i like  
It's my god-given brain  
That cried in pain  
Would i resign  
There's nothing to gain  
If i would restrain  
There's nothing to find  
If i stay behind  
It's my right  
  
My god-given right  
It's my god-given right  
My god-given right  
It's my god-given right  
  
It's my god-given right  
To stand and fight  
For what i like  
It's my god-given brain  
That cried in pain  
Would i resign  
There's nothing to gain  
If i would restrain  
There's nothing to find  
If i stay behind  
It's my right  
My god-given right

No matter how big we are  
We dream of home  
The place where we all belong  
Therefore this sing  
  
We are who we are  
We'll never be a star  
We are where we are  
But we'll never be a star  
  
No time to see all our friends  
There where we are  
Ten thousand miles are quite long  
And much too far  
  
We are who we are  
We'll never be a star  
We are where we are  
But we'll never be a star

When I got told the other day, you said won't it be nice  
To spend some time and share a look there was no thinking twice  
The die was cast no time to lose as much as one can say  
Didn't hesitate to call you back and things were under way  
  
And if it wasn't for the circumstance and well against all odds  
Well that's enough for feeling great the best we could have got  
And just in case there's something wrong so much with you to share  
Much better anyways than watch or stroll round everywhere  
  
Nothing to say  
We got it there  
A long long way  
Right in our hands  
  
Nothing to say  
Now we can use all we give all of our loving and affection  
We'll have our way  
Like we always do  
  
Nothing to say  
Now we can use all we give all of our loving and affection  
We'll have our way  
Like we always do  
  
You called me up the other day just when I thought you would  
And asked if we could break apart as things ain't been too good  
I swallowed hard and got that feel I know it's called unease  
The confidence I've kept so well just came down piece by piece  
  
That's all it takes it's sad but done no way to disagree  
Time takes toll and that's the way it's always gonna be  
  
'Cause it wasn't yet the circumstance but more than just a test  
There's little left for feeling great and all I need's some rest  
There's not a single glimpse of hope well someone took my place  
It's yet another turn for me, i'll be messin' round everywhere  
  
Nothing to say  
We got it there  
A long long way  
Thereof our hands  
  
Nothing to say  
So you refuse all I give all of my loving and affection  
I'll make my way  
Like I always do  
  
Nothing to say  
So you refuse all I give all of my loving and affection  
I'll make my way  
Like I always do  
  
So you refuse all I give all of my loving and affection,oh,oh  
So you refuse all I give all of my loving and affection,oh,oh,oh  
  
Nothing to say  
So you refuse all I give all of my loving and affection  
I'll make my way  
Like I always do  
  
Nothing to say  
So you refuse all I give all of my loving and affection  
I'll make my way  
Like I always do  
  
I got  
I got nothing to say  
I got nothing  
Nothing to say  
  
I got way  
I still brave horizon  
Nothing to spilled  
Long long way  
Nothing to say

Each time when one more year was over  
You refused to hear heaven's bells sound  
And the happiness in you heart's been set lower  
You were searching for friends but no one seemed to be 'round  
  
You merely should think of the good times  
'cause there are so many ways you can go  
Take a look at yourself, you're still very young  
And big aims always take very long  
  
Now it's time for happiness, stay hard and trust your fate  
Don't forget you're something else you'll never be too late  
Trust your fathers' mighty spell you'll never be alone  
Fate will always turn out well and you'll be number one  
  
Shout at the world don't care what they say  
'cause your life is now, here and today  
Luck is there, everywhere  
Go on, reap its goods, that's the way  
You want to have truth, relief from your pain  
But life takes its toll again and again  
Don't fear the night--your future is paid  
And the tracks to your aims are laid  
  
Now it's time

Do you know what there is  
Just behind your wall?  
Do you hate what you can't see  
On the spinning ball?  
  
Ignorant and wasted  
That's what you are  
But you could be so much more  
Listen to your TV  
Believe the words  
And you're dumber than more  
Try to see the real picture  
Train your mind  
To read between the lines  
Take your level higher  
That is your way  
Just get up  
Start out today  
  
Time seems an endless road  
When we are young  
It don't need a genius to know that it's wrong  
  
Hey now, hey now  
Open your life  
Hey now, hey now  
Open your life  
Rise now, rise now  
Feel the new drive  
Hey now, hey now  
Open your life  
  
Full synthetic anger  
That's what you breathe  
It's a strategy for all  
Telling people stories  
And bed time tales  
But the real important false  
So you grow the wrong seed  
Inside your head  
To the will of the modern priest  
Supervised aggression  
Instructed to sleep  
That's the devil that you breed  
  
All that we learn  
Is just one point of view  
Out there in the world  
It may not become true  
Hey now, hey now  
Open your life  
Hey now, hey now  
Open your life  
Rise now, rise now  
Feel the new drive  
Hey now, hey now  
Open your life  
  
Time seems an endless road  
When we are young  
It don't need a genius to know that it's wrong  
  
Hey now, hey now  
Open your life  
Hey now, hey now  
Open your life  
Rise now, rise now  
Feel the new drive  
Hey now, hey now  
Open your life

Since ages now we're caught and occupied  
With our basic civil rights denied  
They came-to-conquer, took our beloved world  
We're left to thrive in sorrow and disgrace  
  
Some never knew what freedom was  
Now, there's guards everywhere  
Someone come!...  
Rise up tomorrow to rectify the injustice being done  
  
Raise the noise bring it on  
I'll sing it while you're gone  
Forever and ever  
On with this for as long  
There won't be another song now or whenever  
  
But they're flawed, they crave the sound of our melodies  
Though exposed to complex things just faint  
This way they're rendered helpless easy prey  
To be grabbed and bound safely locked away  
  
Aldo here's one guy to play the pipe  
Summons mean tunes that kill  
Stadium like set up and verified  
Knock 'em out with your skill  
  
Raise the noise bring it on  
I'll sing it while you're gone  
Forever and ever  
On with this for as long  
There won't be another song now or whenever  
  
Raise the noise bring it on  
I'll sing it while you're gone  
Now and forever  
On with this for as long  
There won't be another song now or whenever

(originally performed by Deep Purple)  
  
Hey baby, what you gonna do  
When the lights go up on you  
What's your name, can I drive you home  
Sweet woman, are you all alone  
You're the one for me  
I'm gonna keep you busy as a bee, could bee, could be  
Rat bat blue  
  
Now, get up woman, don't be slow  
It's getting late and I wanna go  
No cause for acting big  
Got to love, got to live  
Stick around me  
I'm gonna show you things you never thought you'd see, you see  
Rat bat blue  
You're so fine  
  
Get out! You didn't understand  
I'm a hard loving man  
No way you can satisfy  
The way you look, the way you lie  
And when you shut the door  
Make sure I don't see you 'round here no more  
Rat bat blue  
Alright

Coming from the sewerage creepin' through the pipes  
Born from modern chemistry a thing that is alive  
Growing in this rotten crap at places no one wipes  
Eating rats and stinking shit and all it needs to thrive  
  
The scientists got no way to fight  
For they can't find any weak point to get rid of it right  
You live your life and you don't know what's goin' on  
You just can't stop a thinking that the officials do you wrong  
  
You're sometimes wondering what the hell bit your baby's arm  
And the nuns at the holy mission can't keep the tramps from harm  
Even thieves around dark corners too scared to leave the door  
Frustrated businessmen needing a wank can't find themselves a whore  
  
You won't believe 'till you know that it's real  
From the pain in your stomach and the horror you feel  
You need a shit so you head off to the loo  
You're coming to the bog, now what you're gonna do !  
  
[Chorus]  
There's the Reptile (Reptile)  
Just see his eyes  
Reptile (Reptile)  
Can you see the beast arise  
  
[Chorus]  
Reptile (Reptile)  
Creeping up on you  
Reptile (Reptile)  
There's nothing left that you can do  
  
[Chorus]  
And there's the Reptile (Reptile)  
Hidden till now  
Reptile (Reptile)  
But now it's there you don't know how  
  
[Chorus]  
Reptile (Reptile)  
Just watch it grow  
Reptile (Reptile)  
And there's no more human being left but you  
  
Oerrrps !

Well, I think it's really time again for a revolution  
Not to destroy at all costs but have a look at what's there  
Can you remember a time when water was still water  
Or are you too young to even know what we won't give to our heirs  
  
Inhale the bless of science through your lungs, skin and brain!  
I'll surely make our children feel a lot more sane!  
  
Revolution now!  
  
I was born when April guaranteed a sexual renaissance  
And today we're all faced with death, rubbers, and AIDS  
In '68 some people went out to fight for freedom  
They would never ever have thought that their children wear ties  
  
And if you come to San Francisco  
You're gonna meet some broken people there  
  
Revolution now!

Once a singer sang 'bout bullshit  
Everyone could see him fall  
And be sure it's been his last hit  
He's never been seen at all  
  
Some dictator felt progressive  
And lay down in the sun  
But his people were aggressive  
They killed him with a gun  
  
Sometimes you're wrong  
By some things you have done  
You see fate is too strong  
Nothing's won  
  
No use for a fight  
If you're not acting right  
You'll be cut down to size  
Like a lie  
  
[Chorus]  
It's the rise and fall  
The prize for all  
That ain't nice at all  
Luck is like a ball  
You can't recall or care at all  
So better use your brain  
  
A little dragon could spit fire  
But never so for something bad  
He didn't know the knight's desire  
To throw a lance into his head  
  
Romeo loved his Juliet  
Their parents told them "Stop"  
Then it all turned out peculiar  
He couldn't get it up  
  
And it's all in vain  
When you're living with pain  
Reap not goods you have grown  
By your own  
  
Feelings you like  
Disappear overnight  
You sip up every grin  
Free to win  
  
[Chorus]  
It's the rise and fall  
The prize for all  
That ain't nice at all  
Luck is like a ball  
You can't recall or care at all  
You nearly go insane  
  
A spaceman flies the rocket  
That takes him to the stars  
Thinks his wife is in his pocket  
But she's strolling 'round in bars  
  
The king of Los Angeles  
Bought himself a teddy bear  
And the queen became shameless  
She did it with a chair  
  
Sometimes you're wrong  
By some things you have done  
You see fate is too strong  
Nothing's won  
  
No use for a fight  
If you're not acting right  
You'll be cut down to size  
Like a lie  
  
[Chorus]  
It's the rise and fall  
The prize for all  
That ain't nice at all  
Luck is like a ball  
You can't recall or care at all  
So better use your brain

Sent to a world cold as steel  
Don't know where else I have been  
Where will I go? - I can't tell  
Who would save us if we fell  
Can you feel what I see?  
In blind faith would you believe?  
Don't share my point of view  
But it may mean a lot to you  
  
Tell me will we remember  
How it used to be?  
Will it be the same  
In a time in the future?  
Will there be a different way  
Can one ever say?  
  
Anthem for a distant world  
We'll all be alike  
Be there 'til eternity  
One will see  
When salvation comes our way  
  
All my life I was sure  
Kept my thoughts clean, real and pure  
Just as I will always know  
Were down here to learn and grow  
I am my own entity  
And the world is there for free  
Keeps me alive 'til that day  
When my soul will find the way  
  
In another dimension  
You may find paradise  
We'll be safe and warm  
I've been told there will be everyone  
I held so close and near  
There will be no fear  
  
Anthem for a distant world  
We'll be all alike  
Be there 'til eternity  
One will see  
When salvation comes our way  
  
Anthem for a distant world  
We'll be all alike  
Be there 'til eternity  
One will see  
When salvation comes  
When salvation comes  
When salvation comes our way

You hear the people talking you walk the wrong street  
Painting all things black and step on your feet  
Flabby stomach, styled hair, trousers full of air  
Their morality is real ours isn't there  
  
They don't know, no they can't see  
Our hearts close to the sun  
Different in our hearts filled with  
That faith we carry on  
  
[Chorus]  
They just call us savage  
That's what I like to be  
Let them call us savage  
Cause that's what we like to be  
  
See the people wonder we run in our direction  
Let the narrow-minded sleep we better do some action  
Across the universe you smell the smell of lies  
I'm trying to be the winner not the sacrifice  
  
They don't know, no they can't see  
Our hearts close to the sun  
Different in our hearts filled with  
That faith we carry on  
  
[Chorus]  
  
See them run they know no fun  
And look what they have done  
In this world full of rules  
We look just like fools  
  
I know what they think when I see them lookin' at me  
(Savage)  
We come close every day to the time table life  
So mart they start their backwards fight  
  
I know what they think when I see them lookin' at me  
(Savage)  
One day they will drop the bomb  
Cause it's necessary to show the power  
One day they will give a shit on what you say  
  
They don't know, no they can't see  
Our hearts close to the sun  
Different in our hearts filled with  
That faith we carry on  
  
[Chorus]

Piece by piece you're tearin' me apart  
Give to me and try another start  
Brick by brick you really love this game  
Things from which I can't refrain  
  
So many stories have been told  
I give a damn, they're much too old  
How often will we face the end of our dreams?  
When will I see it all come true?  
A splendid time for me and you  
Can we expect it bein' nice as it seems?  
  
Will you be my secret alibi  
Angel of my nights  
Can we do it right?  
Let's just try each others love so sweet  
Till we can't deny my secret alibi  
  
Ding by ding can you dig my dong  
It may come short but it might come long  
Limb by limb you're climbing on my tree  
Making things more fun for me  
  
So many stories I've been told  
I give a damn, they're much too old  
How often will we face the end of our dreams?  
When will I see it all come true?  
A splendid time for me and you  
Can we expect it being nice as it seems?  
  
Will you be my secret alibi  
Angel of my nights  
Can we do it right?  
Let's just try each others love so sweet  
Till we can't deny my secret alibi  
  
[SOLO]  
  
Will you be my secret alibi  
Angel of my nights  
Can we do it right?  
Let's just try each others love so sweet  
Till we can't deny my secret alibi  
  

Born into a neighborhood that ain't exactly rich  
Never knew his father and his mother was a bitch  
Oh no  
Didn't have a place to go  
  
Grown up in the streets  
He learned to take just what he needs  
Violence and crime the only answer he believes  
Oh no  
Your emotions you don't show  
  
How can you ever give up  
When you never were scared?  
How can you ever forgive  
Without learning to blame?  
  
See the night  
That's where you're living  
Feel the dark  
That seems to follow you  
See the stars  
I see you crying  
See the stars  
You wished that one of them just shines for you  
After you're gone  
  
Unemployed and full of hate  
You're dealing with cocaine  
One day you will end up with a needle in your brain  
Oh no  
As you slowly go insane  
  
How can you ever be good  
When you don't see a reason?  
How can you trust an old friend  
When you don't even care for one?  
  
See the night  
That's where you're living  
Feel the dark  
That seems to follow you  
See the stars  
I see you crying  
See the stars  
You wished that one of them just shines for you  
After you're gone  
  
All you know is what you see  
You see society is treating you bad  
No more visions, no more hope  
Your future is a cold, cold cell  
I send you to hell  
  
Falling so deep into darkness  
Crawling so deep in the dark  
Give me a chance to regret what I've done  
Only if I can explain  
  
See the night  
That's where you're living  
Feel the dark  
That seems to follow you  
See the stars  
I see you crying  
See the stars  
You wished that one of them just shines for you  
After you're gone

Well you're just seventeen and all you want to do is disappear  
You know what I mean there's a lot of space between your ears  
The way that you touch don't feel no nothing  
Hey, hey, hey, hey, it was the D.N.A.  
Hey, hey, hey, hey, that made me this way  
Do you know, do you know, do you know, just how I feel?  
Do you know, do you know, do you know, just how I feel?  
  
Sheer heart attack, Sheer heart attack  
Real cardiac  
  
I feel so in-are in-are in-are in-are in-are in-are in-are in-are-tic-you-late  
Gotta feeling gotta feeling gotta feeling like a paralyze  
It ain't no it ain't no it ain't no it ain't no surprise  
Turn on the TV let it drip right down in your eyes  
Hey, hey, hey, hey, it was the D.N.A.  
Hey, hey, hey, hey, that made me this way  
Do you know, do you know, do you know, just how I feel?  
Do you know, do you know, do you know, just how I feel?  
  
Sheer heart attack, Sheer heart attack  
Real cardiac  
  
I feel so in-are in-are in-are in-are in-are in-are in-are in-are-tic-you-late  
Just how I feel  
Do you know, do you know, do you know, do you know, just how I feel?  
Do you know, do you know, do you know, just how I feel?  
Do you know, do you know, do you know, do you know, just how I feel?  
  
Sheer heart attack, Sheer heart attack  
Real cardiac

Daily in the news and on the screen  
They want to show you how to look like  
How to be a star  
But if you big-nosed without muscles  
You are not attractive  
You don't fit in what's so popular  
Four pounds too much without a suntang  
Self-respect is fading  
They already tooked away your pride  
California dreamgirl with her brain down in her pussy  
You will never reach her you're too small  
  
Wake up all you idiots don't close your eyes  
And see there is only one thing you can be  
This is just you and nothing else  
Start to believe all in yourself  
Stop to running after visions you don't need  
  
Who is in the mirror  
Do you really trust this face  
Smiles at you so bad and ugly  
This is not yourself anymore  
Will a soul feel well in plastic bodies  
Where it don't belong  
Silicon and lifted faces  
Don't you really know who you are  
  
Don't try to hide  
If you don't look like monroe  
The smile on your face this is real  
Just be yourself that's the deal  
  
California dream man  
With a smile made out of plastic  
Juicy woman dreams that you can buy  
Selling you a dream so far away  
And so fantastic until you realise you won't get high  
  
Now you're close to suicide  
Your dream bursts like a bubble  
All the gossip you once liked is gone  
Your addiction to be skinny is driving you to madness  
I hope now you can see what you have done

I got that fever  
Burning my head  
So many memories  
No tear so shed  
Burns like a fire  
Who stole my aims?  
My comrade fighters  
Been sent astray  
  
How could I know  
What others had in mind for me?  
How would they know  
What measures I take?  
  
Sole survivor  
Of a kill without alert sing your feelings out  
Your song remains unheard  
Sole survivor  
  
We shared like brothers  
A light in the black  
Totally blended  
Bold and erect  
But we've grown intriguers  
Till it's too late  
Time has brought fire  
Fear, greed and hate  
  
Now I'm cryin'  
Shattered on the ground  
All I find  
Has died anyway  
  
Sole survivor  
Of a kill without alert sing your feelings out  
Your song remains unheard  
Sole survivor  
Got a voice without a sound  
Mean mistreaters  
Took away your ground  
Sole survivor  
  
[SOLO]  
  
Sole survivor...  
  

What keeps on telling me to stay on the way I chose  
What keeps on giving me all the strength to carry on  
  
Give me some time, can't sleep anymore at night  
I want to show I'm here with an aim of mine  
  
I feel strong, but someone is crying, I know  
It's so hard to find a sign of a way to go  
  
Don't need to stone my brain, I need my head for something else  
I want to live and learn, step by step I'm going on  
  
Send me a sign, don't want to resign too soon  
What situation will come I can't endure  
  
I feel strong, but someone is crying, I know  
It's so hard to find a sign of a way to go  
  
Send me a sign, don't want to resign too soon  
What situation will come I can't endure

(originally performed by David Bowie)  
  
Ground Control to Major Tom  
Ground Control to Major Tom  
Take your protein pills and put your helmet on  
Ground Control to Major Tom  
Commencing countdown, engines on  
Check ignition and may God's love be with you  
  
Ten, Nine, Eight, Seven, Six, Five  
Four, Three, Two, One, Liftoff  
  
This is Ground Control to Major Tom  
You've really made the grade  
And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear  
Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare  
  
This is Major Tom to Ground Control  
I'm stepping through the door  
And I'm floating in a most peculiar way  
And the stars look very different today  
  
For here  
Am I sitting in a tin can  
Far above the world  
Planet Earth is blue  
And there's nothing I can do  
  
Though I'm past one hundred thousand miles  
I'm feeling very still  
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go  
Tell my wife I love her very much she knows  
  
Ground Control to Major Tom  
Your circuit's dead, there's something wrong  
Can you hear me Major Tom  
Can you hear me Major Tom  
Can you hear me Major Tom  
Can you...  
  
Here am I floating round my tin can  
Far above the Moon  
Planet Earth is blue  
And there's nothing I can do

You're hanging around and got nuthin' to do  
You want to get out some pills in front of you  
You fly on invisivble wings  
Be careful my friend for too many can kill  
You say that the meaning of life's in those pills  
You forget all earthly things  
  
You swallow your pill you want to feel free  
A trip to a world made of games  
You do it again yet it's never the same  
But a junkie's not somethin' to be  
  
[Chorus]  
Starlight! Fallin' in deep through your eyes!  
Starlight! Shinin' down for your soul to arise!  
  
Now there's a needle lying in front of you  
I'm frightened of those things  
But I'll know what you'll do  
You need it to escape from the night, ha ha  
You ride on through heaven you don't feel no pain  
You ride on and ride on again and again  
On the needle that brings you the light  
  
You feel the mind-blowin' stuff  
Flow through your veins  
You take off and fly to the sun  
But when you get too near your wings will be burnt  
You'll die in the flames and you'll fall

Could we ever stop the thing we dare to live and love?  
I doubt it  
Could we ever picture to be back at home  
And stay wholehearted?  
  
We don't need to talk about it  
We will never fear or doubt it  
On and on  
We sing our songs  
Until we are gone  
  
We wanna stay crazy  
As fresh as a daisy  
We wanna stay easy  
And don't stop believing  
Life's a show  
Oh, a word and a blow  
We wanna stay crazy  
And never get lazy  
We wanna live our way  
Each day as a heyday  
Life's a show  
Oh, we wanna stay crazy  
  
Are we ever looking back with sorrow and regret?  
I doubt it  
If there ever was a better way to live a dream  
We found it  
  
We don't need to talk about it  
We will never fear or doubt it  
On and on  
We sing our songs  
Until we are gone  
  
We wanna stay crazy  
As fresh as a daisy  
We wanna stay easy  
And don't stop believing  
Life's a show  
Oh, a word and a blow  
We wanna stay crazy  
And never get lazy  
We wanna live our way  
Each day as a heyday  
Life's a show  
Oh, we wanna stay crazy  
  
We wanna stay crazy  
We wanna stay crazy  
  
We wanna stay crazy  
As fresh as a daisy  
We wanna stay easy  
And don't stop believing  
Life's a show  
Oh, a word and a blow  
We wanna stay crazy  
And never get lazy  
We wanna live our way  
Each day as a heyday  
Life's a show  
Oh, we wanna stay crazy  
  
We wanna stay crazy  
We wanna stay crazy  
We wanna stay crazy

Headless  
Pulling the machine down  
Coming to the low sound  
Feeling like a real man  
  
Racing  
Flashing from down under  
Flesh and blood and thunder  
Trembling wheel in cold hand  
  
Faster, much faster  
wot a human speed disaster  
Deeper, much deeper  
on through the void I cast'er  
  
I'm a steel tormentor  
And I speed 'round every curve  
I'm a mean inperator  
Of my intimate machine  
  
Turkey  
Near to devastation  
losing all my patience  
Cannot make this kit fly  
  
Danger  
Muscular contraction  
Out for satisfaction  
Mere intoxication  
  
Nightride, it's nightride now-  
try to catch my tail lights  
So sad, I'm so sad  
But you won't ever suck my steel bride  
  
I'm a steel tormentor  
And I speed 'round every curve  
I'm a mean inperator  
Of my intimate machine

Time has come  
Start your search for tomorrow  
No escape  
From that long trail of sorrow  
You don't know how it keeps goin' on, oh no  
  
Wake up out of misty dreams  
Evil drug is starting to grab you, to grab you  
  
Step out of hell, demons dancing 'round your brain  
Step out of hell, streams of madness flow through your veins  
Step out of hell, go on like this you're gonna be dead  
Step out of hell, take my heand I want to help (but can I?)  
  
You did your best  
To keep yourself down  
Give it a rest  
And just turn around!  
It's only a one way street of lies, yes it is!  
  
Living in a twilight zone  
Get away out of that drug jungle, that drug jungle  
  
Step out of hell, demons dancing 'round your brain  
Step out of hell, streams of madness flow through your veins  
Step out of hell, go on like this you're gonna be dead  
Step out of hell, take my heand I want to help you  
  
Another line, have a good time, you don't mind  
To turn your brain inside out  
To serve the final right  
  
Step out of hell, demons dancing 'round your brain  
Step out of hell, streams of madness flow through your veins  
Step out of hell, go on like this you're gonna be dead  
Step out of hell, take my hand I want to help you!

In the beginning  
Out of nowhere  
We had a dream  
And Now It's Helloween  
  
Speed up to a higher limit  
Change gear, we're losin' our spirit  
We won't take your special advice  
We are close to a metal breakdown  
Sirens to warn of our meltdown  
We couldn't see that headline  
  
Now we can see a horizon  
We're gonna be here to stay  
If you cannot see our sign  
You must be blind  
  
Still we go  
Still we go  
Still we go  
On the metal highway  
Still we go  
  
Warn out, won't die on our knees  
Shine on, proud as we can be  
Time has come to stop pleasing you  
Hey man, Let's get it together  
Our strength will last forever  
Push us as far as we can go  
  
Now we can see a horizon  
We're gonna be here to stay  
If you cannot see our sign  
You must be blind  
  
Still we go  
Still we go  
Still we go  
On the metal highway  
Still we go  
  
[SOLO]  
  
How many times must a man cross the lines  
To find his right way  
  
Still we go  
Still we go  
Still we go  
On the metal highway  
Still we go  
  

Forty million years ago  
There was a boy called Leif  
His skin was grey, his eyes were red  
The tentacles counted five  
  
Grown up in a normal house  
His parents beloved son  
There never was the slightest sign  
He'd be the chosen one  
  
Leif (No!)  
Help us (No!)  
Shelter us  
  
He turns into the Sun for the world  
Sun for the world  
What would I say (what would I say)  
Would it be me, my friend  
  
Down on earth we see a star  
Dying in it's light  
Then suddenly it all explodes  
A new sun shines with Leif  
  
Leif (No!)  
Help us (No!)  
Shelter us  
  
He turns into the Sun for the world  
Sun for the world  
What would I say (what would I say)  
Would it be me  
  
Sun for the world  
Sun for the world  
What would you do (what would you do)  
Would it be you, my friend  
  
Leif  
Help us  
Shelter us  
  
He turns into the Sun for the world  
Sun for the world  
What would I say (what would I say)  
Would it be me  
  
Sun for the world  
Sun for the world  
What would you do (what would you do)  
Would it be you, my friend

Now I'm here all alone  
Takin' care of my own  
Down in no man's land  
Got no friend, got no dime  
Only plenty of time  
Where's the saving hand?  
  
I got that feeling to need more and more attention  
That is the fever, don't leave me alone  
I got that feeling to make more than conversation  
That is the fever, where's my home?  
  
Take me home  
Take me home  
Take me home  
  
It's not true - what you see  
Behind that mask that's not me  
Try to reach my world  
Can't you see I'm so blind  
Stay with me to change my mind  
No more nightmares, girl  
  
I got that feeling to need more and more attention  
That is the fever, don't leave me alone  
I got that feeling to make more than conversation  
That is the fever, where's my home?  
  
Take me home  
Take me home  
Take me home  
  
[SOLO]  
  
I got that feeling to need more and more attention  
That is the fever, don't leave me alone  
I got that feeling to make more than conversation  
That is the fever, where's my home?  
  
Take me home  
Take me home  
Take me home  
  

We're living in a constant fight  
Too much pressure everywhere  
And all around  
  
Don't let it pull you down  
Hold on tight  
Cling to your dreams  
  
Don't you depend on someone else  
Think for yourself and win the race  
  
The chance you got comes never twice  
Do your best, (and) do it right  
  
Time will come but don't you hide  
You are on your way  
  
You're led by God but you're not a pawn  
Should live your life, don't care 'bout any scorn  
  
Just let them fool around  
No need to cry  
Don't give up  
  
Try to be as smart as you can be  
I know you own so much ability

There I stood with the sun in my eyes  
Dust on my face  
And mouth parched and dry  
Memories are racing  
Flashing scenes through my mind  
I know what's ahead  
Today would be a good day to die  
  
Once I thought I had a golden heart  
Once I thought my dreams would never shatter  
Now I stand here  
Jaded and cold  
Epitaph being carved on my tombstone  
  
I would die for you - would you die with me?  
No, you can't deny  
Would you catch the bullet that was meant for me?  
Blaze across the sky  
  
Sun is going down  
And there's no tomorrow  
Sun is going down  
Going down on me  
Sun is going down  
No more time to borrow  
Dance with the devil  
Sun is going down  
For the lonely hearted  
Sun is going down  
In a blink of an eye  
Sun is going down  
On the departed  
Laugh at the devil  
  
I would die for you - would you die with me?  
Caught in a fight  
I was drawn again  
I never thought I'd be betrayed  
By my best friend  
He lost his life as he went for mine  
If this is the end  
I want to die with you  
  
Would you catch the bullet that was meant for me?  
Blaze across the sky  
  
Sun is going down  
Going down on me  
Sun is going down  
No more time to borrow  
Dance with the devil  
Sun is going down  
For the lonely hearted  
Sun is going down  
In a blink of an eye  
Sun is going down  
On the departed  
Laugh at the devil  
  
I would die for you - would you die with me?  
No, you can't deny  
Would you catch the bullet that was meant for me?  
Blaze across the sky  
  
Sun is going down  
Going down on me  
Sun is going down  
No more time to borrow  
Dance with the devil  
Sun is going down  
For the lonely hearted  
Sun is going down  
In a blink of an eye  
Sun is going down  
On the departed  
Laugh at the devil  
  
Sun is going down  
No more time to borrow  
Sun is going down  
Sun is going down  
Sun is going down  
...  
  
I would die for you - would you die with me?  
Would you catch the bullet that was meant for me?

Have you seen this little toy  
When you're down it gives you joy  
You escape reality  
Delve into its TV screen  
For the rich and for the poor  
For the even more secure  
Doesn't matter where you are,  
Where you go or when you been  
Well, there's still no guarantee  
For your virgin mind, you see  
Just go on and play the game  
You will surely go insane  
  
The game is on  
And you have gone  
Gone to a world on its display  
And the game is fun  
But when it has won  
All you ever hear is what it says  
  
There's a great amount of fumes  
Coming out from somebody's room  
The firemen got there  
Walking their way up the stairs  
Find a man in a chair  
But it doesn't seem he's there  
With a grey box in his hands  
He has gone to another land  
  
The game is on  
And you have gone  
Gone to a world on its display  
And the game is fun  
But when it has won  
All you ever hear is what it says  
  
[SOLO]  
  
You have played it much too long  
Now your senses get things strong  
All your walls come crashing down  
Now it's time for you to frown  
How d'you like this heavy load?  
Guess your brain will soon explode  
You never had this ugly feel  
It's time to dial an emergency  
  

Sightless the one who relays on promise  
Blind he who follows the path of vows  
Deaf he who tolerates words of deception  
But they who fathom the truth bellow  
  
Shout! Shout! The madness of the crowds hail insane  
The madness of the game  
Guilty the one with his silent knowledge  
Exploiting innocence for himself  
Dangerous he whom our faith was given  
Broad is the road leading straight to hell  
  
Shout! Shout! The madness of the crowds hail insane  
The madness of the game  
Dangerous he whom our faith was given  
Broad is the road leading straight to hell  
Shout! Shout! The madness of the crowds hail insane  
The madness of the game

A tramp found dead, in the street, just made the news  
Forensics report read 'drug abuse'  
Found a warehouse slip in his sleeve  
Marine corps major down-at-heel  
  
They got to the place, unlocked the she'd  
Soon left awestruck, stunned, amazed  
Among stuff and things lay pledges and bonds  
Up to a few Mil in the end  
  
The sage the fool the sinner  
And what goes for you, one can't ever say  
The sage the fool the sinner  
  
One can't foretell fate, no way, no way  
  
Sassy lady puts on her fav heels  
Mirror checked, all done - snow white appeal  
Adjust the dress, ready to leave  
Grab some cash, cab's outside, wipe off a tear  
  
On her way out, she turns once more  
To wave her man good - bye  
While in his sleep, he recalls thirty years - due to end that night.

No more feel, no more heal  
No more light meets my eyes  
Is it night, is it day  
I'm alone, paralyzed  
  
Everybody is waiting for the one  
Everyone will freeze to death alone  
  
The smile of the sun  
Was stolen - someone  
Has taken away  
The heart of all day  
The smile of the sun  
Is gone and no one  
But you drives away  
The pain of the grey  
Is anybody out there  
Somebody help me  
  
Got to breathe, got to move  
Got to get back my life  
Here's no hope, here's no joy  
In this world full of strife  
Gone away, gone astray  
All I once believed in  
It's my soul, it's my heart  
It beats slower and dies  
  
Everybody is waiting for the one  
Everyone will freeze to death alone  
  
The smile of the sun  
Was stolen - someone  
Has taken away  
The heart of all day  
The smile of the sun  
Is gone and no one  
But you drives away  
The pain of the grey  
Is anybody out there waiting  
Anybody out there for me  
The smile of the sun  
Was stolen  
Somebody help me  
  
The smile of the sun  
Is gone and no one  
But you drives away  
The pain of the grey  
  
The smile of the sun  
Was stolen - someone  
Has taken away  
The heart of all day  
The smile of the sun  
Is gone and no one  
But you drives away  
The pain of the grey  
Is anybody out there waiting  
Anybody out there for me  
Is anybody out there searching  
Anybody out there, call me  
The smile of the sun  
Was stolen  
Somebody help me

Achiever, believer  
You saint and cold deceiver  
It's the swing of a fallen world  
Religion, tactician  
Dark horse and politician  
It's the swing of a fallen world  
Betray, but you won't get away  
  
The damage is done  
A million to one  
I bet we will witness the war of the sun  
The game that we play  
Is now here to stay  
We never can stop what we've sent on its way, no  
It's the swing of a fallen world  
The swing of a fallen world  
  
Impeacher, false preacher  
Grand man and paltry creature  
It's the swing of a fallen world  
Manslaughter, garroter  
You've slain, you rough-housed daughter  
It's the swing of a fallen world  
Bye bye, you too will die  
  
The treasure we had  
So crazy and mad  
Was sold out by people who cannot be glad  
A handful of greed  
A contagious seed  
A handful of assholes who never recede  
This adverse evolution  
Mankind knows no solution  
It's the swing of a fallen world  
  
The damage is done  
A million to one  
I bet we will witness the war of the sun  
The game that we play  
Is now here to stay  
We never can stop what we've sent on its way, no  
It's the swing of a fallen world  
The swing of a fallen world

Feel it running off  
So strong and clear  
An age is over fast  
And disappears  
Help him if you can  
His hour will come soon  
Push away his fear  
He'll see Elysium  
It's time  
It's time  
  
Guard him a little while  
And calm his shiver  
Wash and dry his tears  
And cold his fever  
Take the bibles words  
Speak it pure his soul  
Lay love in his mind  
His close to the final goal  
It's time  
It's time  
  
It's time to go  
Time for the freedom  
Time to face what we all believe in  
Pray strong  
Pray to the higher  
Turn your back on the devil's fire  
Time to go  
Time for freedom  
Time to face what we all believe in  
Time is passing by  
  
When his mind is clear  
He called your brother  
Now his brain is dazed  
It's resigning rather  
Mother take his hand  
Say a last good-bye  
We're not gifted to  
Turn water into wine  
It's time  
It's time  
  
It's time to go  
Time for the freedom  
Time to face what we all believe in  
Pray strong  
Pray to the higher  
Turn your back on the devil's fire  
Time to go  
Time for freedom  
Time to face what we all believe in  
Time is passing by

In a circle of fire  
On a cold winter night  
I spoke out my desire  
Made a promise  
I couldn't hide, no!  
  
In a dream  
He came along and told me  
"Your time has come,  
Your mind belongs to me."  
  
It's the time of the oath  
The time of the oath  
My sweetest memories die in the cold  
It's the time of the oath  
  
See me covered with sadness  
And I'll soon wish to die  
When that overcoming madness  
Is eating up my mind  
  
Here and now  
I look back at a good time  
No more lie - I slowly say goodbye  
It's the time of the oath  
The time of the oath  
My sweetest memories die in the cold  
It's the time of the oath  
  
In a dream  
He came along and told me  
"Your time has come,  
Just slowly say good-bye."  
It's the time of the oath  
The time of the oath  
My sweetest memories die in the cold  
It's the time of the oath  
  
Di-es i-rae, di-es il-la  
Sol-vet sae-cium in fa-villa  
Quan-tus tre-mor est fu-tu-rus  
Quan-do ju-dex est ven-turus

We've thrown away our former gods  
Controlling our day  
We have created better ones  
So we control the way  
  
We are the ones with the power  
To hold down the enemy  
Our gods are perfection  
And they are protecting our lives  
We still need some more of them  
To be safe from the other side  
As long as we're stronger  
Nothing will happen to us  
  
Fireflash in the night  
Just an evil dream  
Holy war in the sky, never  
  
Error in store 103  
We watch the sun at night  
The pretty gods we've built ourselves  
Now terminate our lives  
  
Silicon brain powered voices  
Are crying "attack" tonight  
In anger, burning our world  
Doomsday has come  
And there is no place to hide away  
The future is over  
And there is no turning back  
  
Fireflash in the night  
Now reality  
Holy war in the sky  
  
[Chorus]  
Twilight of the gods  
Insania's dead and gone  
Another world was born  
But the twilight soon will come  
  
Fireflash in the night  
Now reality  
Holy war in the sky  
  
[Chorus]

I was born in the rotten part of the town  
The biggest trap I had seen  
Wherever you'll go and wherever you'll get to  
Evil is all around  
  
My mother's a bitch my father's a killer  
Gettin' paid for murder  
Fightin' and strugglin' the whole day  
The only way to survive  
  
Wanted from law but they'll never catch me  
I'd much rather die in this bloody war  
  
Fly high touch the sky  
Never know the reason why it ends  
Victim of fate!  
  
I had to kill people to save my own life  
I don't want to go to hell  
I started at the bottom  
I'm headin' for the top  
  
I'll never return I'll never go back  
To that goddamn part of the town  
Headhunters won't get me 'cause I'm not stupid  
But this ain't the life I dreamt of  
  
Wanted from law but they'll never catch me  
I'd much rather die in this bloody war  
  
Fly high touch the sky  
Never know the reason why it ends  
Victim of fate!  
  
What now lonely man who's standing  
In the shadows of the streets  
You're left alone with no helpin' hand beside you  
You hide from the daylight living in darkness  
You got no friends you can trust nobody  
Except for yourself  
The only shade that's beside you  
Is the shade of Lucifer  
Laughing with a satanic smile  
And his friend Death sharpens his sickle  
You don't want to die, do you? But you will  
You will burn in hell!  
  
Fly high touch the sky  
Never know the reason why it ends  
Victim of fate!  
  
Fly high, touch the sky, you will die!

Climb down my pile  
And again to the beat of my heart  
You're so exiting  
Take all the soul  
I will give you as  
much as you want  
  
Higher, much higher  
Umbouned fire  
Closer, come closer  
Close to the core  
  
We burn, we burn  
  
I contaminate you  
I like to pollute you with my  
G- g- generations  
Look into my eyes  
And we melt into  
on yearning mind  
We climb the stages  
  
Higher, much higher  
Umbouned fire  
Closer, come closer  
Close to the core  
  
We burn, we burn  
Insanity, insanity  
Never set me free  
  
Higher, much higher  
Set me on fire  
Closer, come closer  
Close to the core  
  
We burn, we burn  
Insanity, insanity  
Never set me free

Don't turn your head  
Back to the wall  
Don't close your eyes  
And wait for your fall  
  
If you believe that you know in this time  
You've got anything to win  
If you believe that you know  
Then I say, "You'll lose all again"  
  
In this time there's nothing to get for you  
You cannot really do what you want  
You're a child, a prisoner in your mind  
You are a victim of this hopeless time  
  
You better believe all you do has a sense  
It's not for nothing  
You better believe all the troubles you have  
Will play you someday  
  
Why don't you help yourself and do the best  
Put all the bombs back up their builders' ass  
Why don't you stand up to say who you are  
To show the people that paradise is not far  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, can't you see we got the right  
To look into the future without no need to hide  
No, we won't accept what you do  
We stand up 'cause we're not the people you can abuse  
Oh, can't you see we got the right  
To say we are here to see the light  
No, we don't want to lose all again  
Stand up, you people, to save the world  
As good as you can  
  
We are credulous idiots  
And won't understand what they plan  
We march with the times  
It's what they expect and we do  
  
Why don't you open your eyes  
To undercover all of these lies  
I think you won't accept this  
Go oppose with your fist  
Fight for your rights  
  
[Chorus]

Now it's time, to shake it all up to be free  
Now it's time, to make us some room to let us be  
Oh, it feels so bad  
Yes it feels so bad  
When everything good looks so bad  
When everything right goes so wrong  
  
I am up, to break it all down what's in my way  
I won't stop, until I am where I'm going to stay  
No one holds me back  
No, no one holds me back  
Don't want to be what I'm not  
But it's gotta be myself who breaks my neck  
  
I here and you look there, I know it's got to be somewhere  
We look around and search around and walk around and hear around  
We keep on looking 'til we know what for  
  
If you don't know it, I don't know it, we don't know it, who will know it?  
All of us don't know what we should know, maybe one day we'll know  
But anyway we've got to make a stop  
  
Over my head, look over my head you won't see no halo  
It's driving me mad, I must hold it back inside  
  
When the sinner searches sin, it's all of us  
When we finally search inside, it's under us  
We keep on looking anyway  
If we don't find it who must pay?  
All I've ever done I've done to you!  
  
In my mind, the battle goes on 'til I give up  
Will we find, the key of life we once have dropped?  
Do you really care?  
Tell me you really care!  
You may find Mr. Blame  
But the guilt of life burns everywhere  
  
Give me light to see my inside, give me light to see my sin  
I'd never do what I regret, I've never done anything bad  
You must be joking when you point at me!  
  
Hey! Don't you blame me! Don't you touch me!  
Won't you ever leave me be?  
I want to live! Don't want to think! Why should I give what I can drink?  
Man! Life is short so I take what I need!  
  
Over your head...  
When the sinner...  
  
Pain!  
I feel inside it's such a  
Shame!  
No one fights fair, but who' to  
Blame!  
Might be the game of life but it ain't' over  
Now!  
I walk my way firm any  
How!  
My conscience speaks and there are  
Doubts!  
But nothing's sure in lifeand it ain't over  
Now!  
  
I look here...  
Over my head...  
When the sinner...

I never look higher  
Than I could see  
Never gave less  
Than you have given me  
The more you have taken  
you turned into fakes  
I finally know now why for Heaven's sake?  
  
Don't tell me you did not see that I cried  
Don't act so deaf and blind  
Don't think that if someones made dumb to the core  
He would stay like before  
  
So I take my life  
Back from where the rain grows  
Die to survive  
Back from where the rain grows  
  
Now you call me liar  
'Cause you are just the  
"Always have right fools majority"  
I think that it's someones  
start at your side  
you'd all turn your back  
Won't give any dime  
  
Don't tell me you did not see that I cried  
Don't act so deaf and blind  
Don't think that if someones made sad to the core  
He would stay like before  
  
So I take my life  
Back from where the rain grows  
Die to survive  
Back from where the rain grows  
  
From where the rain grows  
I know where the rain grows  
I'm back from where the rain grows
