Stand in the window  
Close to the edge  
As the neon signs surrender to the light of day  
I sip a bitter cup of coffee  
And I fade away oh I fade away  
There's a cross above my pillow  
Curse words on the wall  
What I'd give to write the pages of my life again  
No I can't believe this is the way  
The story ends oh is this the end is this the end  
I wanna run to the highest mountain  
I wanna stand in the light of the sun  
I wanna ask all this world to forgive the man that I've become  
And now I call on the angels above  
Won't somebody hear won't somebody hear  
My cry of love  
Got a shoe box full of letters  
Got a ring that I should pawn  
There's a picture on the table of the way we were  
I wish to God I could forget  
But I still think of her I think of her  
Oh I think of her  
I wanna run to the highest mountain  
I wanna stand in the light of the sun  
I wanna ask all this world to forgive the man that I've become  
And now I call on the angels above  
Won't somebody hear won't somebody hear  
My cry of love  
Won't anybody listen to me  
Can anybody hear my prayer  
Won't anybody listen to my cry of love  
Won't anybody listen to my cry of love  
Won't anybody listen to my cry of love  
I wanna ask all this world to forgive  
The man that I've become  
And so I call on the angels above  
Won't somebody hear won't somebody hear  
My cry of love  
Won't anybody listen to me  
Can anybody hear my prayer  
Won't anybody listen to me  
Does anybody really care  
My cry of love  

I must have been high  
I must have had plenty  
If she had one  
I don't know I might have had twenty  
Flat on my back with the wind out of my sail  
My friends all say I look a little skinny and pale  
I caught a nasty little bug  
One thing sure there ain't no cure  
When you're down with love  
My head's too hot  
My nose a little runny  
My family doctor  
Stuck me twice and stole my money  
Mirror mirror on the wall let me tell you what I see  
Some kind of strung-out fool staring back at me  
I need a miracle drug  
One thing sure there ain't no cure  
When you're down with love  
  
Enough to make a grown man cry  
Enough to make a mule comply  
Enough to make a made dog tame  
And give a man a good name  
  
One thing sure there ain't no cure  
One thing sure there ain't no cure  
When you're down with love  
Flat on my back with the wind out of my sail  
My friends all say I look a little skinny and pale  
I need a miracle drug  
One thing sure there ain't no cure  
When you're down with love  
  
Enough to make a grown man cry  
Enough to make a mule comply  
Enough to make a made dog tame  
And give a man a good name  
  
One thing sure there ain't no cure  
One thing sure there ain't no cure

Pardon me  
What a rare mood I'm in  
Check the glorious grin  
And the bright eyes above  
Well, excuse me world for being alive  
At last I've arrived  
I've fallen in love  
Ate with augustine monks, babbled in tongues  
Climbed the highest hill in peru  
Took a walk on the ganges, peeled the wraps of rameses  
Slayed me a dragon or two  
Turned saviors and saints, and little green men  
Moonshine and miracle drugs  
But I never quite saw the light  
'till I fell in love  
Pondered zen and zoroaster, and the life ever after  
Blavatsky, marx, moliere  
Found jesus and siddhartha in a bar in djakarta  
Chatting where the air is quite rare  
Let solomon keep his philosopher's stone  
Let jove keep his heavens above  
To my mind it ain't near as divine as falling in love  
I'm in love!  
Pardon me  
What a rare mood I'm in  
Check the glorious grin  
And the bright eyes above  
Well, excuse me world for being alive  
At last I've arrived  
To my mind it ain't near as divine  
Not nearly as sweet and sublime  
As falling in love  
I'm in love!  
Pardon me  
What a rare mood I'm in  
Check the glorious grin  
And the bright eyes above  
Well, excuse me world for being alive  
At last I've arrived  
I've fallen in love  
I'm in love  
Fallen in love  

Once in a life there comes a man like you  
And you bear a son so much like yourself  
And it's hard to believe that he's a grown man  
But pop I understand  
  
Once every night I thank my lucky stars  
You've given me some guiding light  
But there comes a time when a father and a son  
Can no longer be as one  
  
It took me so long to recover  
From the pain of having denied the love I once relied upon  
It takes more than time to discover  
That for both the young and old  
The truth is sometimes cold but right  
  
This is my life  
And I've got to hold my own  
Even if it means hurting us both  
And the wrongs become right when  
We stop and wonder how  
Look at us  
We're better friends now

I feel like flyin'  
I wanna run away with you  
And I feel like dyin'  
If I must go on livin' without you  
Oh love is a mountain ev'ry man must learn to climb  
And I'd reach my highest ground if you were mine  
Oh you, you just need to say the word and I'll be there  
And the world is right when someone really cares  
I feel like flyin'  
I wanna run away with you  
Don't you feel like tryin'  
I wanna spend my nights makin' love with you  
Oh love is a ghost that ev'ry man must learn to see  
And I see your very soul when you're near to me  
Oh you, you just need to call my name and I'll be there  
And the time is always right when someone cares  
Oh you, you just need to say the word and I'll be there  
And the time is always right when someone truly cares  
Oh you, you just need to call my name and I'll be there  
And the time is always right when someone cares  
Oh love is a mountain ev'ry man must learn to climb  
And I'd reach my highest ground if you were mine  

First the high then the low  
I'm getting ero-mantic vertigo  
In the rain then the drought  
Oh that's what loving you is all about  
  
Fly, fly into this night  
Oh and rectify my dreams  
I, I love you more than life  
Though seldom I'm serene  
Feel the cold in the heat  
I'm questioning my blind fidelity  
Love is sweet love is tart  
Loving you's a crime when we're apart  
  
Fly, fly into this night  
Oh and steal my fantasies  
I, I love you more than life  
Though seldom I'm at peace

I don't care much for smokin' weed  
You know I'm a man of a different breed  
I don't thrive on drinking alcohol  
'Sides I'm feelin' much too tall  
  
Gettin' high  
Gettin' high  
Gettin' high  
And I don't mean I'm gettin' stoned  
  
I was just a buckin' bronco bomb  
I loved me a billion black and blue eyed blondes  
I never thought I could change  
Yep sure is pretty strange  
  
Gettin' high  
Gettin' high  
Gettin' high  
On something I've never known  
I've got a babe of my own  
  
Gettin' high  
I've got a babe of my own  
I've got a girl of my own

Mom of my dad woman so sad  
Oh granny's gonna sleep in peace  
Grandmommy of children you love  
Oh granny one more minute with me  
Walk my granny back home to her house in the sky  
I'm gonna walk my granny back home  
Buon giorn' goodbye  
Oh virgin of life widow and wife  
My nana's heart was torn in two  
Cause granddaddy died and he bleeds for his lonely bride  
Oh nana I make a prayer for you  
Walk my granny back home to her spouse in the sky  
I'm gonna walk my granny back home  
Buon giorn' goodbye  
Walk my granny back home to her house in the sky  
I'm gonna walk my granny back home  
Buon giorn' goodbye  
Buon giorn' goodbye  
Buon giorn' goodbye  
So long goodbye  
Oh granny you gonna sleep in peace  

Paddlin' down the michigan  
Catchin' all the fish I can  
Breathin' holy air in my canoe  
Groovin' down superior  
Takin' taboos easier  
Talkin' with the lord in my canoe  
Send me no pillows I can dream on  
I've seen all the nightmares I can bear to see  
Gotta find the river to your kingdom in my canoe  
Many moons on erie lake  
Not a bottle of beer to break  
Heaven knows I try best I can do  
Maybe lake ontario  
Gonna take me where I hope  
Got to find the lord in my canoe  
Paddlin' down the michigan  
Catchin' all the fish I can  
Breathin' holy air in my canoe  
Send me no willows I can weep on  
I've done all the crying I can bear to do  
Lookin' for the tributary to your kingdom  
In my canoe.  

More and more  
Your kiss is like a half opened door  
I can't get in  
You stop me just before I begin  
And it hurts to be in love  
When you never get enough  
Oh it hurts to be in love  
This endless urge  
Keeps my body right on the verge  
We touch and then  
I wanna do it all over again  
And it hurts to be in love  
When you only want me half as much  
I tell you it hurts to be in love  
I'm always worried you think I'm pushing too hard  
Oh baby it hurts me when you tell me I'm going to far  
We touch and then  
I wanna do it all over again  
And it hurts to be in love  
When you only want me half as much  
I tell you it hurts to be in love  
It hurts  
Baby it hurts  
It hurts  

Here I am a man in a new generation  
Keep hanging on to where I belong  
I believe the world is one  
Behind this masquerade  
Reach out of the darkness  
And bring in the light into day  
Here I am a man with a old fascination  
(just an old fascination)  
Still holding the line on my time  
'cause I believe the day will come  
When things will work out right  
Reach out to your brothers  
And save every mother and child  
Well I want you to know  
I believe that a love can find a way  
And I believe that a heart of stone can break  
I believe that a wise man hears a call  
And the writing's on the wall  
And it's shining so bright and clear  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
I believe what's done is done  
And what will be will be  
Reach out to each other  
A moment is all you need  
Well I want you to know  
I believe that a love can find a way  
And I believe that a heart of stone can break  
I believe that a wise man hears a call  
And the writing's on the wall  
And it's shining so bright and clear  

For every just man mocked and killed  
For every drop of black contagion spilled  
This is my house  
This is my evil  
For every battle lost and won  
The spangled banners flapping in the sun  
This is my blood  
This is my people  
The black drums leaking in their graves  
The tin cans rocking on the arctic waves  
For every child the streets will claim  
The curse that rushes through her tiny veins  
For every rose that wilts away  
I die a little more each day  
Just a little more each day  
For every field of wasted grain  
The rockets standing 'neath the western plains  
This is my greed  
This is my glory  
For every fist raised to the sky  
The crimes of hate our young sons glorify  
For every mouth that yearns for bread  
The heart of stone proclaiming  
God is dead  
For every soul that lost its way  
I die a little more each day  
Just a little more each day  
A little more each day  
For all the blessings I disown  
The cruelities I condone  
For every beast of land and sky and sea  
That suffers for my vanity  
For every sin under the sun  
For all the tears from here to kingdom come  
For every beast of land and sky and sea  
That suffers for my vanity  
For every sin under the sun  
For all the tears from here to kingdom come  
For every child the streets will claim  
The curse that rushes through her tiny veins  
For every rose that wilts away  
I die a little more each day  
Just a little more each day  
A little more each day  
Each day

(For your love, for your love)  
When I think about those nights in Montreal  
I get the sweetest thoughts of you and me  
Memories of love above the city lights  
Ooh, I've tried so hard to take it  
But oh Lord my heart won't make it  
  
I just want to stop  
And tell you what I feel about you babe  
I just want to stop  
I never want to live without you babe  
I just gotta stop  
For your love  
  
(For your love)  
For your love  
(For your love)  
When I think about the way the world must turn (the world must turn)  
I get the saddest thoughts for you and me (you and me)  
Memories of life and times go on and on  
Ooh, I've tried hard to forget it  
But oh Lord my mind won't let it  
  
I just want to stop  
And tell you what I feel about you babe  
I just want to stop  
The world ain't right without you babe  
I just gotta stop  
For your love  
  
Oh, I've tried so hard to take it  
But oh Lord my heart won't make it  
  
I just want to stop  
And tell you what I feel about you babe  
I just want to stop  
The world ain't right without you babe  
I just want to stop  
For your love  
  
Stop (Ooh, ooh, ooh)  
I just want to stop (Ooh, ooh, ooh)  
I just want to stop  
And tell you what I feel about you babe  
I just want to stop  
The world ain't right without you babe  
I just want to stop (Ooh, ooh, ooh)  
I just want to stop.

I look at photographs of you  
Sweat and shame till the sun comes through  
I think of things I ought not to  
I've hung your memory on the wall  
A life-size portrait ten feet tall  
I feel my skin begin to crawl  
Suddenly I see you take a breath  
And out of the cameras you come through  
Is it you  
Must be my imagination  
Must be my imagination  
Must be the shock waves of the moon  
The entertainment of a lonely room  
The devil playing that same old tune  
'cause something strange is happening to me  
Feel in the land of make believe  
Please look me up and swallow the key  
'cause I feel your fingers running through my hair  
I feel the human touch of you  
Must be my imagination  
Must be my imagination  

The sun rises after midnight  
Big dreamers never sleep  
She takes a slow walk in the red light  
Wishin' on the stars in concrete  
Jet black roots under alabaster hair  
Betty Grable legs gonna get her somewhere  
She's runnin' every light on the road to recognition  
  
[Chorus:]  
Under one condition  
In the name of money  
In the name of fame  
Anything goes  
When you play that game  
In the name of money  
In the name of fame  
You gotta stick it out  
If you want to claim your fame  
  
So some hotshot in a rag top  
Gets her on the silver screen  
A hundred mirrors far a backdrop  
But her face was never seen  
Agents of love, devils in disguise  
They're blowin' smoke in the little girl's eyes  
Yeah, she'll sign the dotted line and fall into submission  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Someday she'll be a leading lady  
In a baby blue Mercede'  
When she's rich and famous  
Her scandals will entertain us  
The badder the better  
Jet black roots under alabaster hair  
Betty Grable legs gonna get her somewhere  
She's runnin' every light on the road to recognition  
  
[Chorus]

These days I'm looking like a pitiful sight  
Got a suicide smile on my face every night  
I walk alone  
Talk to myself  
Shout angry words up to the sky  
People stop and stare  
Like I'm out of my head  
But what do they know  
About the tears that I cry  
And I cry yes I cry and that's why  
Oooh oooh I'm an inconsolable man  
Oooh oooh since she's gone away that's what I am  
Oooh oooh I'm an inconsolable man  
Nobody understands  
An inconsolable man  
I stop into a church and I waste another prayer  
Well if there's someone listen' to me  
No one's talkin' up there  
So I walk down a street  
Where lonely men sleep  
With what money can buy  
I tell myself that life ain't over just yet  
I can learn to forget if only I try  
And I try and I try but it's a lie  
Oooh oooh I'm an inconsolable man  
Oooh oooh since she's gone away that's what I am  
Oooh oooh I'm an inconsolable man  
Nobody understands  
An inconsolable man  
Nobody  
Nobody  
Nobody understands  
And inconsolable man  
Oooh oooh I'm an inconsolable man  
Oooh oooh since she's gone away that's what I am  
Oooh oooh I'm an inconsolable man  
Nobody understands  
An inconsolable man  

You go through the motions  
Of a woman in love  
Every kiss is a token  
Every sigh is a bluff  
Words confuse me but I see it in your eyes  
You try not to show it  
But any fool would know it  
It's over... It's over this love is ending  
It's over... It's over there's no use pretending  
I see through your make up  
You're not quite yourself  
Don't you know that your games up  
I know there's somebody else  
You tell me I'm crazy and that I'm still the only one  
Well maybe I'm dreaming  
But I know what I'm feeling  
It's over... It's over this love is ending  
It's over... It's over there's no use pretending  
You fake your way through the night time  
But even your best is less than before  
'Cause you don't care anymore  
You tell me I'm crazy and that I'm still the only one  
Well maybe I'm dreaming  
But I know what I'm feeling  
It's over  
It's over  
It's over there's no use pretending  
It's over

My my my what a marvelous life  
Wear your patent leather shoes  
Gotta win and never lose  
Oh then why oh why Jack I cry  
Save your life and flee today  
Why why why such a glorious guy  
Easy friends are easy foe  
Who you never know  
Oh then my oh my oh Jack you'll die  
Save your life and run away  
What are my chances of living  
If I were to stay close to you  
Jack all this crime and no giving  
I couldn't do for you  
What are my chances of living  
If I were to stay close to you  
Jack all this crime and no giving  
I couldn't see for me  
What a life  
Damn your patent leather shoes  
Come the time to pay your dues  
Oh then fly and fly dear Jack goodbye  
Save your life and run away  
Today

Hangin' out in new orleans  
Diggin' on the bourbon scenes  
Just feelin' the vibes of the oncoming days  
There ain't no texan chaparral  
To hide away all those southern belles  
Just thinking about that georgian gal conjures a crazw  
  
Love is a night  
Who really cares if it's wrong or it's right  
And all that I care  
You've been some life and love I could share  
  
Got a thing in tennessee  
She ain't about to marry me  
There's never been a time she says yes and means no  
I had a case in carolin'  
From makin' love on rose wine  
It's strange how they come and they go  
  
Love is a night  
Who really cares if it's wrong or it's right  
And all that I know  
You've been some life and love on the road  
  
Love is a night  
I only know the moment is right  
As for the ladies I've known  
They mean so much when you're all alone

Yes I know how much you love me  
but can't you realize I'd cause you just pain  
cause men like me capricious and free  
live life alone and confused  
yet loving whoever they choose  
  
yes I know how much you need me  
but I just patronize with this affair  
cause all my life I've needed to be  
a man with a mind full of craves  
living to learn from each phase  
  
love me now while I'm here  
love you this man  
take me as I am  
the storm in your life  
  
And hear me out I've something to say  
love is a moment in time  
and now that it's yours and it's mine  
love me now while i'm here  
love you this man  
take me as I am  
the storm in your life  

Love of my life  
Take my heart take my soul  
Take what you need  
Love of my life  
Don't you know I'm just a fool for a good woman's greed  
You broke the wings of a weary vagabond  
And I'm stranded on the island of your love  
You are the fruit of my amazon  
Love of my life I'm no good on my own  
Love of my nights  
Take my pride take my flesh  
Take all my blues  
Love of my life  
Don't you know my life's a bore  
When there's nothing to lose  
I am the prisoner of your paradise  
Sunken in the bayou of your love  
I make this sensual sacrifice  
Love of my life  
For the good of my own  
Love of my life  
I'm no good on my own  
Love of my life  
Take my heart take my soul  
Take what you feel  
Love of my life  
Don't you know I'm just a man  
For a woman who's real  
Love of my life ....  
Love of my life ....  
Love of my life ....

I broke the doldrums of my dreary dreams  
The london bridge kept fallin' down  
I blew my coop and flew to new orleans  
To feast my heart on higher ground  
I wanna thank you for the love you bring  
Louisiana is a song I sing  
Me oh my I don't know what to do  
But love you  
Voila! the marshal frand of mardi gras  
A royal rascal smack dab in his prime  
One billon blue doubloons and a single straw  
In a royal flask of cajun wine  
  
I wanna thank you for the love we made  
Louisiana is a sweet parade  
Me oh my I don't know what to do  
But love you  
I wanna thank you for the love you shine  
Louisiana is a love of mine  
Me oh my I don't know what to do  
But love you  
Oh mardi gras!  

Too many nights of isolation  
Too many echoes in my head  
Too many fires left burning  
In this bed  
Too many thoughts of desperation  
So much pain deep down below  
So mych a slave to my senses  
I can't let go  
From moment to moment  
I live and I die  
This can't go on anymore  
Another day, another lie  
From moment to moment  
I stand and I fall  
This can't go on anymore  
Unless we both give it all  
I ask you how can a man keep his distance  
How can he reason with his heart  
How can you hold me so near  
Yet keep me so far  
From moment to moment  
I live and I die  
This can't go on anymore  
Another day, another lie  
From moment to moment  
I stand and I fall  
This can't go on anymore  
Unless we both give it all  
Sometimes I'd like to break you down  
To see if there's a trace of woman in you that could be found  
But I just keep prayin' you'll come around  
And live from moment to moment  
I live from moment to moment  
I live from moment to moment  
So much a slave to my senses  
I can't let go  
From moment to moment  
I live and I die  
This can't go on anymore  
Another day, another lie  
From moment to moment  
I stand and I fall  
This can't go on anymore  
Unless we both give it all  
You know I want to give it all  
I live from moment to moment  
Everyday of my life  
I live from moment to moment  

My oh my it's a miracle  
Good morning love  
Rise and shine  
It's a beautiful day  
And I feel fine  
Come watch the sun light the sky  
And sip a coffee you and I  
Won't you give us a kiss now  
Perchance a little more  
No don't mind that witch  
Peeking out next door  
I feel like a lark sitting high up a tree  
What's just another day to one man  
Is a miracle to me  
My oh my it's a miracle  
(a miracle to me)  
My oh my it's a miracle  
(it's a miracle)  
All the whinning all the worry  
All the fast friends and the fury  
Oh dear lord  
All the madness that used to move me  
Simply don't behoove me  
No more  
Yeah let it rain let is shine  
If I got you I got mine  
Oh well hello sweet sanity  
I'm alive and I'm smilling  
And that's a miracle to me  
My oh my it's a miracle  
(a miracle to me)  
My oh my it's a miracle  
Now good morning love  
And how are you  
Does your old man seem  
A bit too chearful to be true  
Excuse me if I shed a little tear joyfully  
But when your hand's in my hand  
Yeah when a woman really loves a man  
It's a miracle to me  
My oh my it's a miracle  
(a miracle to me)  
My oh my it's a miracle  
(it's a miracle)  
I'm ten miles high it's a miracle  
(I'm ten miles high it's a miracle)  
Look at my life it's a miracle  
(it's a miracle)  

I sleep at night  
On a cloud high on the horizon  
And when I close my eyes  
My soul is struck by lightning  
Then I sleep at night  
Like a storm  
Oh, I walk the night  
'cause your head is gone from my pillow  
And when the twilight shines  
My eyes crash through the windows  
'cause I sleep at night without you  
When it's dark and the night lays me down  
When the moon shines the light on the ground  
I just run where my thoughts take me to  
'cause I can't live in this world  
Without love without you  
I walk the night  
I walk the night  
Oh, I dream at night  
It must be a madman's rainbow that I'm chasing  
'cause when I close my eyes  
I feel your sweet sensation  
'cause I dream at night about you  
When it's dark and the night lays me down  
When the moon shines the light on my ground  
I just run where my thoughts take me to  
'cause I can't live in this world  
Without love without you  
I walk the night  
I walk the night  
I just run where my thoughts take me to  
'cause I can't live in this world  
Without love without you  
I walk the night  
I walk the night  

To love  
I have lost  
All that is self  
My memories have made the storm  
Now subsides casting my fate  
Inside your soul  
And these eyes  
Are mine no more  
To seek  
I pour myself in your virgin veins  
Now all that I see  
Is through a passion's pain  
Cause I'm all hung up over you  
I'm losing myself  
Loving you  
Your wine is the blood  
That drunkens my heart  
With omens of love and now  
That I am you  
Woman I fear that you're not I  
Oh true love is so so bume and so blue  
The storm has passed  
Deep inside of me  
Crushed by the calm of my insecurity  
'Cause I'm all hung up over you  
I'm losing myself  
Over you

One night with you  
One dream come true  
One love no man can deny  
The good in your eye  
  
One life undone  
One song unsung  
My world of fire and ice  
Become paradise  
Elysium come true in loving you  
  
One angel of man  
Giving me wings to a promised land  
Leaving the world behind  
  
One night with you  
One sky come blue  
One night no rhymes can reveal  
The heaven I feel  
Elysium come true in loving you

Talk about my p's and q's and ladies I know

Darlin' my dear I'm a whole man for you  
Well laugh about my tea's for two's and ladies I've kissed

I'm a one woman lover I'm a regular ham  
I don't need no other cause it's that I am  
Darlin' madame I was born berserk for you  
Talk about my birds and bees and babies I've known

Give him a soft guitar to play what he choose  
He ain't got no fancy chords  
Only got his blues  
Poor happy Jimmy  
I didn't know him very well but he was with me  
And I won't take a dime just to make it rhyme  
Cause I cried and cried the day he died  
Poor happy Jimmy  
Give him sweet melodies he sing with all he has  
He got a funky paraphrase  
It sound like good time jazz  
Poor happy Jimmy  
I didn't know him very well but he was with me  
And I won't put the blame on the aeroplane  
But I boo-hoo'd on the day he flew  
Poor happy Jimmy  
I wonder why  
That I can't forget all the things you said about your life and times  
You set a spell inside  
Oh James your soft guitar it make me feel to cry  
The sole consolation is  
A good man never dies  
God bless you Jimmy  
I love you with all my heart so deep within me  
And you won't see the end of your lonely friend  
Cause I'll pray and pray for you every day  
Poor happy Jimmy  
Poor happy Jimmy ....

Put the weight on my shoulders  
Take the load off of your mind  
Cause the headwinds that blow  
Will fade away in time  
Rest yourself on my waters  
Take the lifeline from me  
Rise above what has passed  
And let yourself be free  
I only know what love must bear  
Through laiden times I will be there  
And when your down I'll break the fall  
Loose the weight on my shoulders  
It ain't no weight at all  
I only know what love must do  
When fortune cries I'll follow you  
And when your down I'll break your fall  
Put the weight on my shoulders  
It ain't no weight at all  
Put the weight on my shoulders  
See you star how it shines  
Cause they're so many dreams  
Left to find  
Put the weight on my shoulders .....  
Put the weight on my shoulders .....  
Put the weight on my shoulders .....  
Put the weight on my shoulders .....  
Put the weight on my shoulders .....  

Coke machines on the ho chi minh trail  
Russian spies shopping at bloomingdales  
Killer bees swarming up the rio grande  
Hey baby where'd you get that tan  
Rome burns as we dance cheek to cheek  
Titanic's sinking but oooh do we look chic  
New york city's got the hong kong flu  
And I can't take my eyes off you

Let's dance  
To the rhythm of romance  
Let's swing

C'mon let's dance  
To the rhythm of romance  
Let's kiss

Johnny woke up from his american dream  
Rich man poor man and a desert in between  
Crystal chandeliers hangin' by a thread  
We're in the pink baby just two trillon in the red  
And I hear gabriel blowing his saxophone  
Through a great big hole in the ozone  
Who cares it the sun don't rise  
When I look in to your ultraviolet eyes  
That's life, this is war  
I took it on faith, can't take it anymore  
Old, young, yin and yang  
We'll all go together in the next big bang  
Boom shug a lug a lug a boom  
Let's dance  
To the rhythm of romance  
Let's swing  
'neath the stars above  
C'mon let's dance  
To the rhythm of romance  
Let's kiss  
Let's fall in love  

Hack jaws and hellions don't you step on my z's  
I'm gettin' rather ornery 'bout my natural means  
I'll I want is a small piece of the pie  
A place in the sun to comfort my eyes  
North of l.a. just south of monterey  
To santa rosa  
I'm gonna break away  
Blue grass and the sycamores and the sweet eucalyptas in the air  
Mad dogs and wolf hounds running everywhere  
You can go with the flow you can bend in the breeze  
Just step to one side and then play the black keys  
North of l.a. just south of santa jose  
To santa rosa  
I'm gonna do what is right to make a better life  
Before it's over  
I'm gonna break away  
Angels and lucifer don't you step on my ground  
I've got a good god-fearing woman who might just shoot you down  
I love her and she loves me  
Together we'll raise such a sweet family  
North of l.a. just south of monterey  
To santa rosa  
I'm gonna do what I can to get the sea and sand  
Back on my shoulder  
I'm gonna sail away  

You been laying it on the line  
Too much fat to burn  
You been stuck on a course  
While the world around you turns  
You been out in the rain  
But babe, oh the sun still shines  
Well you might walk through a cloud  
Seek and you will find  
  
Seek and you will find  
  
It's like treading on thin ice  
Hot stones in your shoes  
Well you know the world can blow your mind  
Unless you got the guts to cut the fuse  
  
You been out on the streets  
And babe how the road does wind  
Well you might look straight ahead  
Seek and you will find  
  
Seek and you will find (seek and you will find)  
  
You been out on a limb  
And so many mountains to climb  
Well you just might be sitting on a rainbow, honey  
Seek and you will find  
  
Seek and you will find

I want some slow love  
The kind that lasts forever  
The kind of love that will be there in the morning  
I want some slow love  
The kind that leaves me never  
The kind of love that lasts a long long time  
Now don't mistake my coolness for a cold heart  
I want you more than you should know  
It's just these days I'm not inclined to move so fast  
Why don't you stay a while say a hundred years or so  
And make some slow love  
The kind that lasts forever  
The kind of love that will be there in the morning  
I want some slow love  
The kind that leaves me never  
The kind of love that lasts a long long time  
I'm not inclined to live a lifetime in one night  
Although I long to touch I yearn for much, much more  
A slow love  
The kind that lasts forever  
The kind of love that will be there in the morning  
I want some slow love  
The kind that leaves me never  
The kind of love I thought I'd never find  
The kind of love that lasts a long time  

Jack my friend, he's a busy man  
Trying to hustle an easy buck instead of a good man's dollar  
Oh Jack my buddy he's so goddamn full of money  
Workin' for a funny company for his father  
He got a black satin shirt best you could buy  
And a big fat straw hat to match his white tie  
And a shiny thirty-eight that'll look you straight in your eye  
Jack miraculous he was a' sure spectaculous  
The son of a New York gun  
Look out Jack ...  
He got a black satin shirt best you could buy  
And a big fat straw hat to match his white tie  
And a big twenty-two that'll make you do what he want  
Jack miraculous he was a' sure spectaculous  
The son of a New York gun  
Look out Jack ... Jack miraculous  
The son of a New York gun  
Look out Jack

The sea is sad the world is stray  
The love of earth has passed away  
And war after war how we fail and ignore what we defend  
And soon it will end  
The pain is east the pain is west  
The greed of all men has ravaged the blessed  
And year after year every crime reappears without a care  
Where are the summers of my life  
Have the seasons all gone cold  
Where are the lovers of this life  
Who's drowned the fires of our souls  
What have we done  
If God is good then God be cruel  
Take back the world you've granted to fools  
Salvage the land that is best without man and all his grief  
Where are the summers of my life  
Have the seasons all gone cold  
Where are the lovers of this life  
Who's drowned the fires of our souls  
Where are the summers of my life  
Have the seasons all gone cold  
Where are the lovers of this life  
Who's drowned the fires of our souls

Blow east wind blow  
Blow as you may  
Wish I had the power  
To take your breath away  
This life is golden  
But it's only deep as the skin  
Feelin' much colder  
Though I'm standin' in the warm desert wind  
Gotta leave this town  
Else I'll go crazy if I stay  
If I see one more sunset on l.a.  
I'll miss you blue sky  
But not so much  
Too much of a good thing  
Keeps this old soul out of touch  
Sometimes you're empty  
Though your dreams they all seem fulfilled  
You're cool on the outside  
Though the real you is slowly being killed  
Gotta leave this town  
Else I'll go crazy if I stay  
If I see one more sunset on l.a.  
Left a girl lyin' 'neath an old willow tree  
At times I think she'll still be waitin' there for me  
Gotta leave this town  
But it's always one day away  
Just saw one more sunset on l.a.  
Gotta leave this town  
Else I'll go crazy if I stay  
If I see one more sunset on l.a.  
One more sunset on l.a.  
Don't want to see  
One more sunset on l.a.  
Baby wait for me

Who's that a-knockin' at my door tonight?  
Leave me alone 'til there's morning light  
You live and learn, you make mistakes  
You can't imagine why  
The fire burns for heaven's sake  
Look out for the evil eye  
Who was that damsel with that wicked stare?  
Get off my case and take your sins elsewhere  
You love and learn, you cross that bridge  
You want to pacify  
The tables turn and you've dug your ditch  
Look out for the evil eye  
Oh look out!  
Oh look out!  
I said look out!  
I said look out!  
You live and learn, you make mistakes  
You wonder how and why  
The fire burns for heaven's sake  
Look out for the evil eye  
Oh look out!  
Oh look out!  
I said look out!  
I said look out!  

An urgent call in the dead of night  
A voice that whispers "Now"  
A voice that trembles like a winter leaf  
Before it hits the ground  
She leaves a crack in the bedroom door  
To slip the wire through  
Her husband sleeping in a empty bed  
No witness to the truth  
  
It's a oneway conversation  
I try to tell her no  
But it's a hopeless situation  
I just can't let her go  
And here she is another desperate night  
In the arms of the other man  
Another day in a double life  
Every moment that she holds me tight  
I know just where I stand  
As I am the other man  
  
She leaves my room like a criminal  
To beat the morning light  
Rehearsing ever little alibi  
To get it water tight  
  
There's a note on the dresser top  
It's the same old classic line  
She says she's leaving him  
It's just a question of time  
It's a no win situation  
  
'Cause I just can't let her go  
And here she is another desperate night  
In the arms of the other man  
Another day in a double life  
Every moment that she holds me tight  
I know just where I stand  
  
As I am the other man [Repeat: x4]

The coolness of your kiss  
The lingering of your sigh  
Your sweet yet unconvincing smile  
Tell me no lie  
Is it a wish for second youth  
The age of lost romance  
Or does a half-forgotten dream need one more chance  
It's your life, what can I say  
Right or wrong, either way  
You owe it to yourslf to have your day  
Well I must admit I'm crushed  
Bewildered and betrayed  
Still I won't hold you to the promises we made  
Ah, love is such a mess  
It's a painful work of art  
Seems it's every man for himself to find his heart  
So say goodbye and say no more  
See what lies outside that door  
You owe it to yourself to know for sure  
No tears, no lies, no long goodbyes don't be cruel, baby  
Just let me wish you well  
Go seek and find, while I'm still inclined to play the fool, baby  
You owe it to yourself  
So say goodbye and say no more  
See what lies outside that door  
You owe it to yourself to know for sure  
Know for sure  
For sure  

One life to live  
No time to pretend  
No wins no loss  
No heroes in the end  
No dreams no plans no promises  
  
Young lover  
Just turn out the lights  
One kiss  
One softly whispered yes  
No talk oh no, no tears  
No hearts to repossess  
No names no chains no hostages  
  
Young lover  
Just turn out the lights  
Slip under the cover  
Of the night  
Young lover, young lover, young lover  
Everything's all right  
  
Young lover  
Just turn out the lights
