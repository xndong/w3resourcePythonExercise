Don't you be Tarot-fied

Don't you never try to look behind my eyes  
You don't want to know what they have seen  
Don't you never try to look behind my eyes

Joe:  
Some people think  
That if they go too far  
They'll never get back  
To where the rest of them are  
I might be crazy  
But there's one thing I know  
You might be surprised  
At what you find out when ya go!  
  
Oh oh oh  
Mystical Advisor  
What is my problem, tell me  
Can you see?  
  
L. Ron Hoover:  
Well, you have nothing to fear, my son!  
You are a Latent Appliance Fetishist,  
It appears to me!  
  
Joe:  
That all seems very, very strange  
I never craved a toaster  
Or a color T.V.  
  
L. Ron Hoover:  
A Latent Appliance Fetishist  
Is a person who refuses to admit to his or herself  
That sexual gratification can only be achieved  
Through the use of MACHINES . . .  
Get the picture?  
  
Joe:  
Are you telling me  
I should come out of the closet now  
Mr. Ron?  
  
L. Ron Hoover:  
No, my son!  
You must go into  
THE CLOSET  
  
Joe:  
What?  
  
L. Ron Hoover:  
And you will have  
  
Joe:  
Eh?  
  
L. Ron Hoover:  
Hey!  
A lot of fun!  
That's where they all live  
So if you want an  
Appliance to love you  
You'll have to go in there  
'N get you one  
  
Joe:  
Well . . . that seems simple enough . . .  
  
L. Ron Hoover:  
Yes, but if you want a really GOOD one,  
You'll have to learn a foreign language . . .  
  
Joe:  
German, for instance?  
  
L. Ron Hoover:  
That's right . . .  
A lot of really cute ones come from over there!  
(Fifty bucks, please)  
  
L. Ron Hoover:  
If you been  
Mod-O-fied,  
It's an illusion, an yer in between  
Don't you be  
Tarot-fied,  
It's just a lot of nothin',  
So what can it mean?

Central Scrutinizer:  
This is the CENTRAL SCRUTINIZER . . . Joe has just learned to speak German.
Now, get this, here's why he did it! He's gonna go to this club on the other
side of town, it's called THE CLOSET . . . And they got these Appliances in
there that really go for a guy dressed up like a housewife who can speak
German (you know what I mean) . . . so Joe's learned how to speak German, he
goes in this place and he sees these little Kitchen Machineries dancing around
with each other, and he sees this one . . . that looks like it's a cross
between an industrial vacuum cleaner and a chrome piggy bank with marital aids
stuck all over its body . . . it's really exciting . . . and when he sees it,
he BURSTS INTO SONG . . .

Mark: Well uh . . . I play a v-, a version of myself a-, as Frank sees me, you
know, like, you know what I mean?  
Interviewer: No  
Mark: It's not, uh, he sees the group from . . . like we see him from one
point of view and he sees us from another place, this was written around like
we're, you know, the folklore that each member had brought to create the image
that we portray, like, uh, some of the scenes have happened before,
specifically the, the hotel room scene where the group sits and talks about
how Frank is not important to what the group is and . . . that scene I
remember happening many times, uh, just the whole idea that it is Frank Zappa

Stood Charlie's friends  
Who could not save  
This stupid girl  
From the way she behaved  
But among the mourners  
And the frowners  
A cry were heard...(aaaargh!)

They was all you could get  
To ease your mind  
And your deep regret  
Over Charlie's mouth  
So enormous 'n wet  
Now all you got  
Is your TV set  
You turn it on  
And watch and dream  
A dream of love  
On the tiny screeen  
And what do you see  
As you lay in bed?  
It's a bald kinda girl  
With a pointed head  
Oh no...

I-I-I-I-I doubted your love  
But now you mean everything to me

I came home the other day and she was

I ain't the type to plead  
If she don't change those evil ways  
I'm gonna make her bleed  
She can scream and she can holler  
Bang her head all along the wall  
If she don't give me what I want  
She ain't gonna have no head at all

And the reason you have not seen her, seen her  
Is she is underneath the lawn  
  
  

Fz: Some of you may know that the tango, which is not a very popular dance
anymore, was at one time reputed to be a dance of unbridled passion, back in
the old days when it wasn't so easy to get your rocks off, when it was hard to
make contact with a member of the. .. Opposite camp, and you had to resort to
things like dancing close together and going hey. .. Those were the days.
Well, those days are probably gone forever, I don't know, unless Nixon is
going to bring them back a little bit later, but, we have this very special
highly evolved permutated tango. It's actually a perverted tango. By the time.
.. Yes, it's so perverted! This is the "Be-Bop Tango," a special entertainment
event that includes choreography a little bit later, so watch out, folks. ..
You can turn on the big lights, we may need 'em. You know, the ones in the
audience. Heh heh heh. Okay, you're ready? Not too fast now 'cause I wanna get
the right notes on the tape 'n this, this has to be the one. This has to be
the one with all the right notes on it. Okay, 're you ready? 'n this is a hard
one to play. .. One, two, three, four. ..  
  
Fz: The cowbell as a symbol of unbridled passion, ladies and gentlemen.  
  
Fz: Now, as you might have noticed, Bruce Fowler has just completed some sort
of trombone solo, based on the, uh, idea of an evolved tango-event. Bruce has
also prepared for you a demonstration of a dance that he hopes will sweep the
ocean, right after the Mud Shark did. Bruce is now warming up the important
muscles of the body, in preparation. .. In preparation for the Real Live Be-
Bop Tango which we're gonna demonstrate. Napoleon will assist him.  
Napoleon: Wait a minute now. ..  
Fz: Napoleon, just put your horn down, just relax, put your head back, here
comes the drill. Okay, ha ha ha, you know what I'm talkin' about? Okay. ..
This is sort of like jazz in it's own peculiar way. .. Jazz is not dead, it
just smells funny. .. Okay, let's go!  
George: Yeah, man, jazz, man, you know what I mean?  
  
This is Be-Bop,  
Even though you think it doesn't sound like that  
  
(Be-Bop. .. ! That's no Be-Bop!)  
  
Fz: Now, as you might have noticed, some of you with a musical education can
tell that the notes that George just sang when he went: "This is Be-Bop, even
though you think it doesn't sound like that," it's actually a sort of a
twisted form of the theme of the tango itself which will get de. .. Even more
depraved as the number goes on. George will now attempt to dismember that
melody, play it and sing it at the same time while. ..  
  
Pe-dop!  
  
Fz: Hey, that's the way. .. While we sort of dance to it, okay? Try it,
George. ..  
  
Pe-do-do-dum-deh-dum-deh do-do-deh-dum-deh  
Tee-do-do-Teep  
Goop  
Do-do  
Tee-dum-do-do tee-dum-do-do keep do-deah  
E-dum do-dee-dum  
Do-do-dee-doo  
Do-dee-Dah. ..  
Oh, yeaaaah!  
  
George: As I was saying. ..  
Fz: Now, what we'd like to do at this point is get some volunteers from the
audience to. .. I know you will, oh God, you will. .. We need some. .. Heh heh
heh. .. Now, as a matter of fact you did, didn't you. .. No, we wanna have
some people who've never tried it before, who've never even thought of trying
it before. A boy, a girl, preferably who like each other, who would like to
come up here and attempt to dance to what George sings. ..  
  
Pe-dop  
  
Fz: Do we have anybody whose. .. ? You're one. Okay, what's your name?  
Carl: Carl.  
Fz: Your name is Carl? Please, Carl, step on to the stage. .. Pleased to meet
you, Carl  
  
Pe-do-dum-dee  
Dum-dee-dum-de-de-dop  
  
Fz: Alright. Okay? Let's see, uh. .. Is there anybody in the, in the back?
Well. .. Oh-oh, hey! What's your name?  
Rick: Rick.  
Fz: Rick, and?

Mark: He, I used to sing, he used to sing "How is the weather" in "Happy
Together" and pour a whole glass of water over my head, man, and he liked it
so much that he made it an integral part of the show, the kids loved it, so I
just let it keep happening  
Aynsley: He can't stand it, man, that's all. ..  
Mark: And you're just a pansy ass, kiss ass little girl. ..  
?: Ha ha ha!  
Mark: Simmons!  
Howard: Beer is another thing, man! I'm fucking soaked!  
Mark: They use beer in some shampoos, Howard

Watch your brother grow a beard  
Got another year of school  
You're okay, he's too weird  
Be a plummer  
He's a bummer  
He's a bummer every summer

Tv tonight  
Do you love it  
Do you hate it  
There it is  
The way you made it  
  
A world of secret hungers  
Perverting the men who make your laws  
Every desire is hidden away  
In a drawer in a desk by a Naugahyde chair  
On a rug where they walk and drool  
Past the girls in the office  
  
We see in the back  
Of the City Hall mind  
The dream of a girl about thirteen  
Off with her clothes and into a bed  
Where she tickles his fancy  
All night long  
  
His wile's attending an orchid show  
She squealed for a week to get him to go  
But back in the bed his teen-age queen  
Is rocking and rolling and acting obscene  
Baby, baby. ..  
Baby, baby. ..  
Cimmie then cakes, uh!  
If I do I'm gonna lose my...  
  
And he loves it, he loves it  
It curls up his toes  
She wipes his fat neck  
And it lights up his nose  
But he cannot be fooled  
Old City Hall Fred  
She's nasty, she's nasty  
She digs it in bed  
That's right  
  
Do it again, ha  
And do it some more  
Hey, that does it, by golly  
And she's nasty for sure  
Nasty nasty nasty  
Nasty nasty nasty  
Only thirteen, and she knows how to nasty  
  
She's a dirty young mind, corrupted  
Corroded  
Well she's thirteen today  
And I hear she gets loaded  
  
If she were my daughter, I'd...  
What would you do, Frankie?  
If she were my daughter, I'd...  
What would you do, Frankie?  
Check this out  
Smother my daughter in chocolate syrup  
And strap her on again, oh baby  
Smother that girl in chocolate syrup  
And strap her on again, oh baby  
She's my teen-age baby  
She turns me on  
I'd like to make her do a nasty  
On the White House lawn  
Smother my daughter in chocolate syrup  
And boogie 'till the cows come home  
  
Time to go home  
Madge is on the phone  
Got to meet the Gurney's and a dozen gray attorneys  
Tv dinner by the pool  
I'm so glad I finished school  
Life is such a ball  
I run the world from City Hall

I coulda swore her hair was made of rayon  
She wore a Milton Bradley Crayon  
But she was something I could lay on  
Can't remember what became of me . . .  
Carolina Hardcore Ecstasy  
  
She put a Doobie Brothers tape on  
I had a Roger Daitrey cape on  
There was a bed I dumped her shape on  
Can't remember what became of me . . .  
Carolina Hardcore Ecstasy  
  
Somewhat later on  
I woke up and she was gone  
There was dew out on the lawn  
In the sunrise  
Later she came back  
With a rumpled paper sack  
Which she told me would contain  
A surprise  
  
She stuck her hand right in it to the bottom  
Said she knew I'd be surprised she got'em  
Take a Charleston pimp to spot 'em  
Then she gave a pair of shoes to me ...  
Plastic leather, 14 Triple D  
  
I said: I wonder what's the shoes for  
She told me: Don't you worry no more  
And got right down there on the tile floor:  
Now Darling STOMP ALL OVER ME! ...  
Carolina Hardcore Ecstasy  
  
Is this something new  
Having people stomp on you?  
Is it what I need to do  
For your pleasure?  
What is this, a quiz?  
Don't you worry what it is  
It is merely just a moment  
I can treasure  
  
By ten o'clock her arms and legs were rendered  
She couldn't talk 'cause her mouth had been extendered  
Looked to me as though she had been blendered  
But was this abject misery?  
No! No!  
Carolina Hardcore Ecstasy!  
  
It might seem strange to Herb and Dee -  
Carolina Hardcore Ecstasy!

Concentration moon  
Over the camp in the valley  
Concentration moon  
Wis I was back in the alley  
With all of my friends,  
Still running free:  
Hair growing out  
Every hole in me  
American way  
How did it start?  
Thousands of creeps  
Killed in the park  
American way  
Try and explain  
Scab of a nation  
Driven insane  
Don't cry  
Gotta go bye bye  
Suddenly: die die  
Cop kill a creep!  
Pow pow pow  
  
Concentration moon  
Over the camp in the valley  
Concentration moon  
Wish I was back in the alley  
With all of my friends,  
Still running free:  
Hair growing out  
Every hole in me  
American way  
Threatened by us  
Drag a few creeps  
Away in a bus  
American way  
Prisoner: lock

Over the camp in the valley  
(Concentration Moon)  
(Oh what A)  
Concentration Moon  
(I wish I was back in the alley)  
Wish I was back in the alley  
With all of my friends,  
Still running free:  
(Running free!)  
Hair growing out  
Every hole in me  
(That's right, you heard right:  
Hair growing out  
Every hole in me!)  
American way  
How did it start?  
Thousands of creeps  
Killed in the park  
American way  
Try and explain  
Scab of a nation  
Driven insane  
Don't cry  
Gotta go bye bye  
Suddenly: die die  
Cop kill A creep! Pow pow pow

Concentration Moon

(Oh what A)  
Concentration Moon  
Wish I was back in the alley

Still running free:

Hair growing out  
Every hole in me  
(That's right, you heard right  
And here's one for little Carl)  
American way  
Threatened by us  
Drag a few creeps  
Away in a bus  
American way  
Prisoner: lock  
Smash every creep  
In the face with A rock  
  
Don't cry  
(No no no no)  
Don't cry  
(No no no, no-no-no no no)  
Don't cry

Don't shoot (no no no no no)  
Don't shoot (no no no no no)  
Don't shoot (no no no no no)  
Don't shoot (no no no no no)  
Cop kill A creep!  
Cop want A creep!  
Kill another creep!  
Kill the fucking creep!

You were right, I was wrong  
Please forgive me, come back home  
Don't you know, don't you know  
Don't you know I love you so?  
Don't you know, don't you know  
Everyday I love you more?  
Just can't go on since you've gone  
Feel so blue over you  
Don't you know, don't you know  
Don't you know I love you so?  
Don't you know, don't you know  
Everyday I love you more?  
Please come back, need you so  
I won't ever let you go  
Don't you know, don't you know  
Don't you know I love you so?  
Don't you know, don't you know  
Everyday I love you more?  
Cries for you night and day  
Please come back home and stay  
Don't you know, don't you know  
Don't you know I love you so?  
Don't you know, don't you know  
Everyday I love you more?  

The mystery man came over  
And he said I'm outta sight!  
He said for a nominal service charge  
I could reach nirvana tonight  
If I was ready, willing and able  
To pay him his regular fee  
He would drop all the rest of  
His pressing affairs and devote  
His attention to me  
  
But I said look here brother  
Who you jiving with that cosmik debris?  
Now who you jiving with that cosmik debris?  
Look here brother, don't waste your time on me  
  
The mystery man got nervous  
And he fidget around a bit  
He reached in the pocket of his mystery robe  
And he whipped out a shaving kit  
Now I thought it was a razor  
And a can of foaming goo  
But he told me right then when the top popped open  
There was nothin' his box won't do  
With the oil of aphrodite, and the dust of the grand wazoo  
He said you might not believe this, little fella  
But it'll cure your asthma too  
  
And I said look here brother  
Who you jiving with that cosmik debris?  
Now what kind of a guru are you, anyway?  
Look here brother, don't waste your time on me  
(don't waste your time)  
  
I've got troubles of my own, I said  
And you can't help me out  
So, take your meditations and your preparations  
And ram it up your snout!  
But I got the crystal ball, he said  
And held it to the ligh  
So I snatched it, all away from him  
And I showed him how to do it right  
  
I wrapped a newspaper 'round my head  
So I looked like I was deep  
I said some mumbo-jumbo, then  
I told him he was going to sleep  
I robbed his rings and pocketwatch  
And everything else I found  
I had that sucker hypnotized  
He couldn't even make a sound  
I proceeded to tell him his future, then  
As long as he was hanging around  
I said the price of meat has just gone up  
And your old lady has just gone down!  
  
And I said look here brother-who you  
Jiving with that cosmik debris?  
Now is that a real poncho or is that a sears poncho?  
Don't you know, you could make more money as a butcher?  
So, don't waste your time on me  
Don't waste it, don't waste your time on me

Out in cucamonga  
Many years ago  
Near a holy roller church  
There was once a place  
Where me and a couple of friends  
Began practicing for the time  
We might go on tv  
And as fate would have it  
Later on we got a chance to play.  
All we ever really knew:  
That it was crazy (nanook, no-no)  
To be doin' it any other way  

C'mon everybody and let's get together tonight  
Got some money in my jeans and I'm really gonna spend it right  
No more movies for a week or two  
No more running 'round with the usual crew  
Ah, who cares?  
C'mon everybody  
Well, my baby's number one but I gotta dance with three or four  
The place is really shaking form the bare feet slapping on the floor  
When you hear the music you can't sit still  
Your brother won't rock but your sister will  
Whoo  
C'mon everybody  
My place is really rocking, so we gotta put a guard outside  
If my folks come home, I'm afraid they're gonna have my hide  
No more movies for a week or two  
No more running 'round with the usual crew  
Who cares?  
C'mon everybody  
c'mon everybody and let's get together tonight  
Some money in my jeans and I'm really gonna spend it right  
No more movies for a week or two  
No more running 'round with the usual crew  
Ah, who cares?  
C'mon everybody

June, a rancho granny,

Shoes are too tight and pointed  
Ankles sorta puffin' out  
Cause me to shout:  
Oh debra algebra ebneezra kadabra  
Witch goddess, witch goddess of lankershim boulevard.  
Cover my entire bodice, with avon cologna.  
And drive me to some relative's house, in east l.a. (foogadah! ? )  
(Just till my skin clears up)  
Turn it to channel thirteen,  
And make me watch the rubber tongue, when it comes out  
From the puffed, and flatulent mexican rubbergoods mask.  
Next time they show the Bernaca  
Make me buy the flosser.  
Make me grow brainiac fingers.  
But with more hair!  
(But with more hair)  
Make me kiss your turquoise jewelry.  
Emboss me.  
Rub the hot front part of my head,  
With ridged unguents  
Give me bas relief!  
Cast your dancing spell my way  
I promise to go under it.  
If she casts a spell my way,  
I promise to go under it.  
If she casts a spell my way,  
I promise to go under it.  
Oh, hear this!  
Learn the pachuco hop, and let me twirl you!  
Learn the pachuco hop, and let me twirl you!  
Oh debra fauntleroy magnesium kadabra! take me with you!  
Don't you want any a these?

Dinah-moe  
I couldn't say where she's coming from  
But I just met a lady named dinah-moe  
She stroll on over, say look here, bum  
I got a forty dollar bill say you can't make me cum  
  
She made a bet with her sister who's a little dumb  
She could prove it any time all men was scum  
I don't mind that she called me a bum  
But I knew right away she was really gonna cum (so I got down to it)  
  
I whipped off her bloomers and stiffened my thumb and applied rotation on her
sugar plum  
I poked and stroked till my wrist got numb  
But I still didn't hear no dinah-moe  
  
[Chorus]  
Dinah-moe humm  
Dinah-moe humm  
Dinah-moe humm  
Where this dinah-moe coming from  
  
Done spent three hours  
An' I ain't got a crumb  
From the dinah-moe,  
Dinah-moe,  
Dinah-moe  
From the dinah-moe humm  
  
I got a spot that gets me hot  
But you ain't been to it  
I got a spot that gets me hot  
But you ain't been to it  
  
I got a spot that gets me hot  
But you ain't been to it  
I got a spot that gets me hot  
But you ain't been to it  
  
Cause I can't get into it  
Unless I get out of it  
And I gotta get out of it  
Before I get into it  
  
Cause I never get into it  
Unless I get out of it  
An' I gotta be out of it  
To get myself into it  
  
Just get me wasted  
And you're half-way there  
Cause if my mind's tore up  
Then my body don't care  
  
I rubbed my chinny-chin-chin  
An' said my-my-my  
What sort of thing  
Might this lady get high upon?  
  
I checked out her sister  
Who was holding the bet  
And wondered what kind of trip  
The young lady was on  
The forty dollar bill didn't matter no more  
When her sister got naked and laid on the floor  
  
She said dinah-moe might win the bet  
But she could use a little if I wasn't done yet I told her...  
Just because the sun  
Want a place in the sky  
  
No reason to assume  
I wouldn't give her a try  
So I pulled on her hair  
Got her legs in the air  
  
And asked if she had any cooties on there  
  
She was buns-up kneeling  
Buns up!  
I was wheeling an dealing  
Wheeling and dealing an  
She surrendered to the feeling  
She sweetly surrendered  
An' she started in to squealing  
  
Dinah-moe watched from the edge of the bed  
With her lips just a-twitching an' her face gone red  
Some drool rolling down  
From the edge of her chin  
While she spied the condition  
Her sister was in  
  
She quivered and quaked  
And clutched at herself  
While her sister made a joke  
About her mental health  
  
Till dinah-moe finally  
Did give in  
But I told her  
All she really needed  
Was some discipline...  
  
Kiss my aura...  
Dora...  
M-m-m...  
It's real angora  
Would y'all like some more-a?  
  
Right here on the flora?  
An' how 'bout you, fauna?  
Why want to?  
Mmm...sound like why might be choking on something did you say you want some
more?  
Well, here's some more...  
  
Mmm, sure...listen  
Do you think I could interest you  
In a pair of zircon-encrusted tweezers? mmm...tweezers!  
Here, lemme sterilize 'em...  
Gimme your lighter...  
  
I couldn't say where she's coming' from  
But I just met a lady named dinah-moe  
She stroll on over, say look here, bum  
I got a forty dollar bill say you can't make me cum  
  
I whipped off her bloomers and stiffened my thumb an' applied rotation on her
sugar plum  
I poked and stroked till my wrist got numb  
An' you know I heard some

Just whip me up some dragon lotion  
For your dirty love  
  
Give me  
Your dirty love  
Like some tacky little pamphlet  
In your daddy's bottom drawer  
Give me  
Your dirty love  
I don't believe you've never seen  
His book before  
  
I don't need no consolation  
I don't want your reservation  
I only got one destination  
An' that's your dirty love  
  
Give me  
Your dirty love  
Just like your mama  
Make her fuzzy poodle do  
Give me  
Your dirty love  
The way your mama  
Make that nasty poodle chew  
  
I'll ignore your cheap aroma  
And your little-bo-peep diploma  
I'll just put you in a coma  
With some dirty love

Bad Conscience: Does this kind of life look interesting to you? Night after
night, dinners with Herb Cohen. Thrill-packed, fun-filled evenings on the
French Riviera at the midem convention. A big tie, the whole bit. Watch Mutt
eat, and Leon feed the geese. One thousand green business cards, with your
name and the wrong address. Plus six royalty statements, inspected and
customized by ran toon tan han toon frammet and dee. Followed by twelve
potential suicides as the members of your group, past and present, find out
they can't collect unemployment. A dog, a car, an epidemic of body lice with
your own record company, your name on the door, electric buzzer to the inner
office, Ona's tits, and a three month supply of German bookings with tickets
on Air Rangoon. Does this kind of life look interesting to you? As a big rock
and roll guitar player in a comedy group?

There's a ship arriving too late  
To save a drowning witch  
She was swimmin' along  
Tryin' to keep a date  
With a merchant marine  
Who told her he was really rich  
But it doesn't matter no more...  
She's on the ocean floor  
'n the water's all green down there  
'n it's not very clean down there  
'n water snakes  
'n rusty wrecks  
Is all that she can see  
As the light goes dim  
And she's tryin' to swim  
Will she make it?  
(boy, we sure hope so...)  
Not even a witch oughta be caught  
On the bottom of america's spew-infested  
Ho-ho-ho, hey-hey...  
She could get radiation all over her  
She could mutate insanely... (aie-ee-aie)  
She could mutate insanely... (earth wall)  
Then you know  
She could go on the freeway and grow up to be 15 feet tall  
And very very scary-lookin'  
And then...  
Cars could crash all over the place  
As a result of people with hawaiian shirts on...  
Lookin' up to hear her go "ha ha ha..."  
Sardines in her eyebrows...  
Lobsters up 'n down her pudenda  
All of them horribly large from graduation...  
And smelling very bad  
And dangerous!  
Maybe a submarine could save her,  
That's right! yes, that's true!  
And bring her back just like a mud-shark...  
Tell 'em what they win, bob!  
Well, therefore ladies:  
A full week's supply of gartenion's onion rings,  
Bronco's new bondage-in-a-bottle!  
It won't crack, it won't stake, it won't beat, it won't budge,  
It won't bite the old fate...  
And of course a brand new, absolutely brand new,  
New, new, and of course, but also a new car!  

A moon beam through the prune In June  
Reveals your chest I see your lovely beans  
And in that magic go-kart I bite your neck  
The cheese I have for you, my dear  
Is real and very new  
  
A moon beam through the prune In June

If it is a real prune Knows no cheese

And I know The love I have for you  
Will grow and grow And grow, I think  
And so my love I offer you  
A love that is strong A prune that is true  
  
Lalalalalala...lalalalalaaa  
My darling, you mean so very much to me,  
I love you so deeply  
It just makes me...  
Duke, duke, duke, duke of prunes, prunes, prunes  
I'll never forget you darling...  
  
And you'll be my duchess, my duchess of prunes  
  
A moon beam through the prune In June  
Reveals your chest I see your lovely beans  
And in that magic go-kart I bite your neck  
The cheese I have for you, my dear  
Is real and very new  
  
(New cheese)  
Prunes! (pa-da-dah!)  
If they are fresh prunes Knows no  
(cheeky chanky, cheeky chanky)  
And they just lay there  
Tell me and sing me and just if I don't know  
And I know I think The love I have for you  
Will never end (well maybe)  
And so my love, I offer you  
A love that is strong A prune that is true  
  
This is the exciting part  
This is like the Supremes, see the way it builds up...  
Baby, baby, baby.  
My prune is yours my love,  
My cheese for you,  
My baby prunes, my baby prunes, my baby prunes,  
My baby prunes, my baby prunes, my baby prunes,  
Oh baby prunes.  
Cheesy, cheesy.

Whoever we are  
Wherever we're from  
We shoulda noticed by now  
Our behavior is dumb  
And if our chances  
Expect to improve  
It's gonna take a lot more  
Than tryin' to remove  
The other race  
Or the other whatever  
From the face  
Of the planet altogether  
They call it the earth  
Which is a dumb kinda name  
But they named it right  
'cause we behave the same...  
We are dumb all over  
Dumb all over,  
Yes we are  
Dumb all over,  
Near 'n far  
Dumb all over,  
Black 'n white  
People, we is not wrapped tight  
Nurds on the left  
Nurds on the right  
Religious fanatics  
On the air every night  
Sayin' the bible  
Tells the story  
Makes the details  
Sound real gory  
'bout what to do  
If the geeks over there  
Don't believe in the book  
We got over here  
You can't run a race  
Without no feet  
'n pretty soon  
There won't be no street  
For dummies to jog on  
Or doggies to dog on  
Religious fanatics  
Can make it be all gone  
(I mean it won't blow up  
'n disappear  
It'll just look ugly  
For a thousand years...)  
You can't run a country  
By a book of religion  
Not by a heap  
Or a lump or a smidgeon  
Of foolish rules  
Of ancient date  
Designed to make  
You all feel great  
While you fold, spindle  
And mutilate  
Those unbelievers  
From a neighboring state  
To arms! to arms!  
Hooray! that's great  
Two legs ain't bad  
Unless there's a crate  
They ship the parts  
To mama in  
For souvenirs: two ears (get down!)  
Not his, not hers, (but what the hey? )  
The good book says:  
("it gotta be that way!")  
But their book says:  
"revenge the crusades...  
With whips 'n chains  
'n hand grenades..."  
Two arms? two arms?  
Have another and another  
Our God says:  
"there ain't no other!"  
Our God says  
"it's all okay!"  
Our God says  
"this is the way!"  
It says in the book:  
"burn 'n destroy...  
'n repent, 'n redeem  
'n revenge, 'n deploy  
'n rumble thee forth  
To the land of the unbelieving scum on the other side  
'cause they don't go for what's in the book  
'n that makes 'em bad  
So verily we must choppeth them up  
And stompeth them down  
Or rent a nice french bomb  
To poof them out of existence  
While leaving their real estate just where we need it  
To use again  
For temples in which to praise our god  
("cause he can really take care of business!")  
And when his humble tv servant  
With humble white hair  
And humble glasses  
And a nice brown suit  
And maybe a blond wife who takes phone calls  
Tells us our God says  
It's okay to do this stuff  
Then we gotta do it,  
'cause if we don't do it,  
We ain't gwine up to hebbin!  
(depending on which book you're using at the  
Time...can't use theirs... it don't work  
...it's all lies...gotta use mine...)  
Ain't that right?  
That's what they say  
Every night...  
Every day...  
Hey, we can't really be dumb  
If we're just following god's orders  
Hey, let's get serious...  
God knows what he's doin'  
He wrote this book here  
An' the book says:  
He made us all to be just like him,"  
So...  
If we're dumb...  
Then God is dumb...  
(an' maybe even a little ugly on the side)

This girl is easy meat  
I seen her on the street  
See-through blouse an' a tiny little dress  
Her manner indiscreet...i knew she was  
Easy, easy, easy meat  
Easy, easy, easy meat  
Easy, easy, easy, easy  
Easy meat, easy meat, easy meat, easy meat  
She wanna take me home  
Make me sweat and moan  
Rub my head and beat me off  
With a copy of rollin' stone  
Easy, easy, easy meat  
Easy, easy, easy meat  
Easy, easy, easy, easy  
Easy meat, easy meat, easy meat, easy meat  
...they're just not gonna stand for it...  
I told her I was late  
I had another date  
I can't get off on the rollin' stone  
But the robots think it's great...i knew she was  
Easy, easy, easy meat  
Easy, easy, easy meat  
Easy, easy, easy, easy  
Easy meat, easy meat, easy meat, easy meat  
Easy  
She was so easy  
Easy  
Saw her tiny titties  
Through her see-through blouse  
I just had to take the girl to my house  
Easy  
Meat

Every time I see you...  
Whenever you walk by,  
I want to hold you.  
Darling, please let me try.  
Darling, I love you,  
I really do.  
Darling, I want you.  
Let me be true.  
I want to hold...  
Every time I see you.  
  
If you would love me...  
We'd never, never part.  
We would be lovers...  
Heart unto heart.  
Darling, I love you...  
I really do.  
Darling, I want you...  
Let me be true.  
I want to hold you...  
Every time I see you

The clouds are really cheap  
The way I seen 'em through the forts  
Of which there is a half-a-dozen  
On the base of my resorts  
  
You wouldn't think I'd have too many  
Since I never cared for sports  
But I'm never really lonely  
In my Excentrifugul Forz  
  
There's always Korla Plankton  
Him and me can play the blues  
And then I'll watch him buff that  
Tiny ruby that he use  
  
He'll straighten up his turban  
And inject a little ooze  
Along a one-celled Hammond organsim  
Underneath my shoes  
  
And then I'll call pup tentacle  
I'll ask him how's his chin  
I'll find out how the future is  
Because that's where he's been  
  
His little feet got long and flexible  
And suckers fell right in  
The time he crossed the line  
From later on, to way back when

(Get up on your feet and do the Funky Alfonzo)  
  
Father Vyvian O'Blivion  
Resplendent in his frock  
Was whipping up the batter  
For the pancakes of his flock  
He was looking rather bleary  
He forgot to watch the clock  
  
But the night before  
Behind the door  
A leprechaun had stroked it  
  
But the night before  
Behind the door  
A leprechaun had slowly stroked it  
He slowly stroked it  
  
But the night before  
Behind the door  
A leprechaun had stroked his spot  
He stroked his smock  
  
It set him off in such a frenzy  
He sang "Lock Around the Crock!"  
  
And he topped it off with a  
And he topped it off with a  
And he topped it off with a  
  
As he stumbled on his  
He was delighted as it stiffened  
And ripped right through his sock  
  
"Oh St. Alfonzo would be proud of me"  
He shouted down the block  
  
Dominus vobiscum  
Et cum spiritu tuo  
Won't you eat my sleazy pancakes  
Just for Saintly Alphonzo  
  
They're so light and fluffy white  
We'll raise a fortune by tonight  
They're so light and fluffy white  
We'll raise a fortune by tonight  
They're so light and fluffy brown  
They're the finest in the town

Find her finer, sneak up behind her  
Wrapped like a mummy 'till you finally unwind her  
Find her blinder, see who designed her  
Act like a dummy 'till you finally grind her  
  
If you should see a girl on the street  
Now maybe you might think she is sweet  
But if you wanna tickle her treat  
Now really, what should you do?  
(Rat-tat-tat-tat ta-da!)  
  
Don't never let her know you are smart  
The universe is no place to start  
You gotta play it straight from the heart  
She gwine renunciate you  
(That's why you gotta)  
  
Find her finer, sneak up behind her  
Wrapped like a mummy 'till you finally unwind her  
Find her blinder, see who designed her  
Act like a dummy 'till you finally grind her  
  
Now maybe you might think this is crude  
And maybe you might think I am rude  
And maybe this approach I have spewed  
Is not the one for you  
(Rat-tat-tat-tat ta-da!)  
  
But believe me later on you'll find  
As you impress her with your mind  
That you would just be left behind  
For a wiser fool  
(So you might as well)  
  
Find her finer, sneak up behind her  
Wrapped like a mummy 'till you finally unwind her  
Find her blinder, see who designed her  
Act like a dummy 'till you finally grind her  
  
Find her finer, sneak up behind her  
Wrapped like a mummy 'till you finally unwind her  
Find her blinder, see who designed her  
Act like a dummy 'till you finally grind her  
  
Find her finer, sneak up behind her  
Wrapped like a mummy 'till you finally unwind her  
Find her blinder, see who designed her  
Act like a dummy 'till you finally grind her  
  
Find her finer, sneak up behind her  
Wrapped like a mummy 'till you finally unwind her  
Find her blinder, see who designed her  
Act like a dummy 'till you finally grind her  
  
Find her finer, sneak up behind her  
Wrapped like a mummy 'till you finally unwind her  
Find her blinder, see who designed her  
Act like a dummy 'till you finally grind her

Flakes! flakes!  
Flakes! flakes!

They never be workin'  
When they oughta should  
They waste your time  
They're wastin' mine  
California's got the most of them  
Boy, they got a host of them  
Swear t'god they got the most  
At every business on the coast  
Swear t'god they got the most  
At every business on the coast  
They got the flakes  
Flakes! flakes!  
They can't fix yer brakes  
You ask 'em, "where's my motor? "  
"well, it was eaten by snakes..."  
You can stab 'n' shoot 'n' spit  
But they won't be fixin' it  
They're lyin' an' lazy  
They can be drivin' you crazy

At every business on the coast  
Swear t'god they got the most  
At every business on the coast  
Take it away, bob...  
I asked as nice as I could  
If my job would  
Somehow be finished by Friday  
Well, them whole damn weekend  
Came 'n' went, frankie  
Wanna buy some mandies, bob?  
'n' they didn't do nothin'  
But they charged me double for Sunday  
You know, no matter what you do,  
They gonna cheat 'n' rob you  
Then they'll send you a bill  
That'll get your senses reelin'  
And if you do not pay  
They got computer collectors  
That'll get you so crazy  
'til your head'll go through th' ceilin'  
Yes it will!  
I'm a moron, 'n' this is my wife  
She's frosting a cake  
With a paper knife  
All what we got here's  
American made  
It's a little bit cheesey,  
But it's nicely displayed  
Well we don't get excited when it  
Crumbles 'n' breaks  
We just get on the phone  
And call up some flakes  
They rush on over  
'n' wreck it some more  
'n' we are so dumb  
They're linin' up at our door  
Well, the toilet went crazy  
Yersterday afternoon  
The plumber he says  
Never flush a tampoon!  
This great information  
Cost me half a week's pay  
And the toilet blew up  
Later on the next day-ay-eee-ay  
Blew up the next day  
Woo-ooo  
We are millions 'n' millions,  
We're coming to get you  
We're protected by unions  
So don't let it upset you  
Can't escape the conclusion  
It's probably god's will  
That civilization  
Will grind to a standstill  
And we are the people  
Who will make it all happen  
While yer children is sleepin',  
Yer puppy is crappin'  
You might call us flakes  
Or something else you might coin us  
But we know you're so greedy  
That you'll probably join us  
We're coming to get you, we're coming to get you  
We're coming to get you, we're coming to get you  
We're coming to get you, we're coming to get you  
We're coming to get you, we're coming to get you...  

He used to be very kind in his own crude way  
He wasn't always like I wanted him to be  
He wasn't smart, he wasn't handsome either  
But he thrilled me when he drilled me  
And I never loved a monster quite like he...  
  
Because his love was so flambay  
His kisses burned me so, his kisses turned me  
From a queen on a throne to a shriveling spool  
Here I stand all alone, a spider's fool  
  
When it's me he needs to fondle his tool  
I guess some bugs are just that way  
He don't really need your love  
He don't really need you  
To be there when his hair gets matted and grey  
With a broom cleaning his room from the mess he made that day  
All those earthling worms he nibbled away  
  
Oh hunchentoot my love, how could you desert me now?  
Oh hunchentoot you brute, can't you see I want you?  
Stay with me flagrantly  
And we'll have ecstasy for all eternity  
  
Because your love is so flambay  
You kisses burn me so, your kisses turn me  
From a queen on a throne to a shriveling spool  
I don't mind if you're unkind 'cause spiders rule  
  
Yes you are real cool  
With those little webs you spool  
And all your spider drool  
Oh let me float in your pool

"Food Gathering In Post-Industrial America, 1992."  
  
When the last decrepit factory has dumped its final load of toxic waste into
the water supply and shipped its last badly manufactured, incompetently
designed consumer thing, we gaze in astonishment as the denizens of NU-PERFECT
AMERICA, dine on rats (mmmmm), poodles, Styrofoam packing pellets, all
floating in a broth of tritium-enriched sewage, roasting the least diseased
body parts of abandoned wild children accumulating since the total ban on
abortion a few years back.

And who are those dudes in the  
Back seat of calvin's car?  
  
Where did they go?  
When they got off the car?  
Did they go get sandwich  
And eat in the dark?

It was September, the leaves were gold  
That's when our hearts knew that story untold  
We were young lovers, strolling near  
The fountain of love, founttain of love  
Do you remember, I held you so near  
Our love's glowing ember so precious and dear  
We were young lovers, strolling near  
The fountain of love, the fountain of love  
Fountain of love, fountain of love  
We made a wish and threw in a coin  
And since that day our hearts have been joined  
So all you young lovers, wherever you are  
The fountain of love is not very far  
We'll go on dreaming of that golden day  
And remember the fountain is not far away  
We were young lovers strolling near  
The fountain of love, fountain of love  
Fountain of love, fountain of love

Frogs with dirty little nose  
Dirty little spots all over their clothes  
Dirty legs  
Dirty feet  
Dirty little frogs is what you eat

Ain't you de clever one! Tell us, harry-As-A-Boy, howdja recide upon this heah
life-style bein' de one for you?  
  
Harry-As-A-Boy:  
  
It was pretty simple, really. I lost all desire for intercourse with females
when they started carrying those briefcases and wearing suits 'n ties.  
  
Rhonda:  
  
What?  
  
Harry-As-A-Boy:  
  
Let's face it: that would be like fucking a slightly more voluptuous version
of somebody's father! 'n I'm far too sensitive for such a traumatic
experience!  
  
Thing-Fish:  
  
You means de womens' libromation movenint done created de uncontrollable
urgement to play dingle-dangle-dingle wit de personal requipment of yo own
gender?  
  
Harry-As-A-Boy:  
  
To a degree. .. I mean. .. Look, I'm not stupid! I know it's all a thoroughly
workable government-sponsored program to control the Population Explosion,
and, just like every other american, I'm too concerned with my own personal
health and well being to think of devoting any of my precious time to
something as boring as 'reproduction'!  
  
Rhonda:  
  
Harry, I used to think you were merely an over-Educated shit-Head, but now
that I finally have proof, it's going to give me great pleasure to refer to
you as an over-Educated cocksucker!  
  
Harry:  
  
Well, to be honest with you, dearest, I sort of. .. Gulp, gulp. ..  
  
Rhonda:  
  
Where's the fairies on a string, harry? Huh? Riddle me this!  
  
Thing-Fish:  
  
Easy there, white folks! I told y'all'd be gettin' yo' fairies after while, 'n
y'know dat sort o' thing take a little time to woik up to in yo' broadway
sitchyatium! Mammys step faw'd 'n hep de lil' cocksucker out!

Joe:  
I'm out at last  
Boy, the world sure looks different  
Wow . . . there's hardly anything fun to do  
Since they made music illegal  
But I'm hooked  
I got the habit  
I've got to have it  
I need to play  
But there's no musicians anymore  
They're all gone  
Wait! I've got it!  
I'll be sullen and withdrawn  
I'll dwindle off into the twilight realm  
Of my own secret thoughts  
I'll walk through the parking lot  
In a semi-catatonic state  
And dream of guitar notes  
To go with the loading zone announcements.  
  
Central Scrutinizer:  
  
This is the CENTRAL SCRUTINIZER  
The White Zone is for loading and unloading only.  
If you gotta load or unload, go to the White Zone.  
You'll love it.  
It's a way of life.

Mrs. Borg Voice:  
  
Turn it down!  
Turn it down!  
I have children sleeping here!  
Don't you boys know any nice songs?  
I'm calling the police!  
I did it!  
They'll be here . . . shortly!  
I'm not joking around anymore!  
You'll see now!  
There they are . . . they're coming!  
Just listen to that mess, would you!  
Every day this goes on around here!  
He used to cut my grass . . .  
He was a very nice boy . . .  
He used to cut my grass . . .  
He was a very nice boy . . .  
He used to cut my grass . . .  
He was a very nice boy . . .  
He used to cut my grass . . .  
He was a very nice boy . . .  
  
Central Scrutinizer:  
  
This is the CENTRAL SCRUTINIZER . . . Yes . . . he used to be a nice boy . . .
He used to cut the grass . . . But now his mind is totally destroyed by music.
He's so crazy now he even believes that people are writing articles and
reviews about his imaginary guitar notes, and so, continuing to dwindle in the
twilight realm of his own secret thoughts, he not only dreams imaginary guitar
notes, but, to make matters worse, dreams imaginary vocal parts to a song
about the imaginary journalistic profession . . .

And if these words you do not heed  
Your pocketbook just kinda might recede  
When some man comes along and  
Claims godly need  
He will clean you out right through your  
Tweed  
That's right, remember there is a big  
Difference between kneeling down  
And bending over...  
He's got twenty million dollars  
In his heavenly bank account...  
All from those chumps who was  
Born again  
Oh yeah, oh yeah  
He's got seven limousines  
And a private plane...  
All for the use of his  
Special friends  
Oh yeah, oh yeah  
He's got thousand-dollar suits  
And a wembley tie...  
Girls love to stroke it  
While he's on the phone  
Oh yeah, oh yeah  
At the house of representatives  
He's a groovy guy...  
When he gives thanks  
He is not alone...  
He is dealin'  
He is really dealin'  
Irs can't determine  
Where the hook is  
It is easy with the bible  
To pretend that  
You're in show biz  
They won't get him  
They will never get him  
For the naughty stuff  
That he did  
It is best in cases like this  
To pretend that  
You are stupid  
He's got presidential help  
All along the way  
He says the grace  
While the lawyers chew  
Oh yeah  
They sure do  
And the govenors agree to say:  
"he's a lovely man!"  
He makes it easier for  
Them to screw  
All of you...  
Yes, that's true!  
'cause he helps put the fear of god  
In the common man  
Snatchin' up money  
Everywhere he can  
Oh yeah  
Oh yeah  
He's got twenty million dollars  
In his heavenly bank account  
You ain't got nothin', people  
You ain't got nothin', people  
You ain't got nothin', people  
Thank the man...oh yeah

Here lies love  
In a grave caused by jealousy  
Here lies love  
In a grave caused by jealousy  
Hate was a pall bearer  
And on the tombstone was written misery  
It was a bad situation  
From the beginning to the end  
It was a bad situation  
From the beginning to the end  
I say, baby you killed my love  
Now the undertaker is your friend  
Now I'm sad and I'm blue  
There's not much I can do  
If these blues don't leave me  
The undertaker will get me too  
Ooh-hoo here lies love  
In a grave caused by jealousy  
You know that hate was the pall bearer  
And on the tombstone was written misery

Howard: It's him, he's watching us!  
Mark: You think he heard us?  
Ian: I've been in the band for years, and. .. You can bet that he hears
everything  
Jeff: Let's go over and pretend to be nice to him  
Howard: Let's go over and pretend we don't know he's watching  
Mark: And ripping off all our good material  
Howard: Hi, man  
Ian: Hi, Frank  
Mark: Hi, man  
Jeff: Hi, Frank  
Aynsley: Hi, man  
George: Hi, Frank  
Mark: Well, that's a great new comic song you wrote, that one about the penis
and everything, I was laughing a lot while I was learning it  
Howard: Yeah, Frank, uh, it was a little hard to get into it first, but, uh,
once we got the drift. ..  
Jeff: That's a real great part you got in there for the chorus when they go
ran-tan-toon ran-ta-tan, while I steal the room and everything, I don't mind
he's ripping it off so long I get paid. ..  
Mark: Me too, I won't even care 'bout the part where it goes "what can I say
about this elixir?" so long as me and Howard and Jeff get credit for special
material, there's some bad ground acid. .. Aynsley, you can take it with a
grain of salt, ha ha ha. ..  
Aynsley: I don't mean to upset you, lads. .. I don't mean to upset you, lads,
but the reason my retorts were so snappy is because he's making me do this, I
should imagine he's making you do yours too, isn't he?  
Howard: Get out of here, you creep, you used to live in his house!  
Aynsley: See you later, lads

Honey honey, hey  
Baby don't you want a man like me  
Honey honey, hey  
Baby don't you want a man like me  
He was the Playboy Type (he smoke a pipe)  
His fav'right phrase was "OUTA-SITE!"  
He had an Irish Setter  
It was a singles bar, a Tuesday night  
The moon was dim, the band was tight  
They did the bump together  
What a splendid sight,(Ren-nen-nen-nen) her teeth were white  
The drinks were cheap (it was Ladies Nite)  
He was glad that he met her  
She was an office girl ("My name is Betty")  
Her fav'right group was HELEN REDDY  
(They discussed the weather)  
Honey honey, hey  
Baby don't you want a man like me  
Honey honey, hey  
Baby don't you want a man like me  
Honey honey, hey  
Baby don't you want a  
Baby don't you want a  
Baby don't you want a man  
She was the lonely sort, just a little too short  
Her jokes were dumb and her fav'right sport  
Was hockey (in the winter)  
He was duly impressed and was quick to suggest  
Any sport with a PUCK had to be 'bout the best  
As he jabbed his elbow in her ("Get it honey? Get it?")  
Later on they went off to where the music was soft,  
The candles were drippy, they saw a REAL HIPPY  
Who delivered their dinner  
The rice was brown, and soon they found  
That the crowd around that had jammed the room,  
Well it seemed to be getting thinner  
Honey honey, hey  
Baby don't you want a man like me  
Honey honey, hey  
Baby don't you want a man like me  
Honey honey, hey  
Baby don't you want a  
Baby don't you want a  
Baby don't you want a man  
He took her home to a motor court  
She wouldn't kiss him, he tried to ignore it,  
But it made him angry!  
Angry, it made me angry, it made me so angry I could have killed that  
Lousy BITCH!)  
He called her a slut, a pig and a whore  
A bitch and a cunt and she slammed the door  
In a petulant frenzy!  
(A petulant frenzy, this is a petulant frenzy.  
I'm petulant, and I'm having a frenzy)  
On the sofa she weeps  
BOO HOO HOO HOO  
She weeps and she weeps  
BOO HOO HOO HOO HOO HOO  
She weeps and she peeks  
Through the curtain  
He just got in his car  
But the battery's dead  
So he asks to use the phone  
And she gives him some head  
And that's the end of the story  
Honey honey, hey  
Baby don't you want a man like me  
Honey honey, hey  
Baby don't you want a man like me  
Honey honey, hey  
Baby don't you want a  
Baby don't you want a man  
Baby don't you want a man sometimes?

When I won your love  
I was very glad  
Every happiness in the world  
Belonged to me  
Then our love was lost  
And you went away  
Now I shed my tears  
In lonely misery  
  
I know now that you never ever  
Really loved me  
It hurts me now to think you never ever  
Really cared  
I sit and ask myself a thousand times  
To try and find  
What really happened  
To the love  
That we shared  
  
How could I be such a fool  
How could I believe  
All those lies you told me  
How could I be taken in  
By your sweet face  
You spoiled our love  
You ruined my life  
I'm so tore down  
I'm a terrible disgrace  
  
But there will come a time  
And you'll regret the way  
You treated me  
As if I was a fool  
And didn't know  
The many times you lied  
About your love for me  
Someone else is gonna know  
That your love was just a show  
  
How could I be such a fool?

Hey Baby,  
What's the word?  
Hey Baby,  
Have you heard?  
What's the latest?  
How's your bird?  
  
How's your brother?  
An' how's your mother?  
How's Aunt Funny?  
And how's your granny?  
This is absurd.  
How's your bird?  
  
(Excuse me...)  
  
How's your bunion?  
An' how's your grunion?  
Now I'm stuck.  
Lots o' luck.  
This is absurd.  
How's your bird?  
  
How's your fern?  
(I don't love you...)  
An' how's your ear lobe?  
How's your nose?  
  
(You dirty fink!)  
And your elbow?  
An' how's your foot?  
  
(...natural fink! Find out...)  
Don't forget your sister.  
An' you know, like I said...

Ain't got no heart  
I ain't got no heart to give away  
I sit and laugh at fools in love  
There ain't no such thing as love  
No angels singing up above today  
Girl I don't believe  
Girl I don't believe in what you say  
You say your heart is only mine  
I say to you, you must be blind  
What makes you think that you're so fine  
That I would throw away  
The groovy life I lead  
'cause baby, what you've got, yeah  
It sure ain't what I need  
Girl you'd better go  
Girl you'd better go away  
I think that life with you would be  
Just not quite the thing for me  
Why is it so hard to see my way  
Why should I be stuck with you  
It's just not what I want to do  
Why should an embrace or two  
Make me such a part of you  
I ain't got no heart to give away  
Away  
No no no no no no no  
Ain't got no heart  
Ain't got no heart  
I ain't got no heart to give away

I come from nowhere  
And you should go there  
Just try it for a while  
The people from nowhere  
Always smile  
Their eyes are all frozen over  
The sides of their faces pooch out at the corners  
Because that's what happens when their mouths turn up  
On both sides  
Which is why we can tell they're smiling  
They never frown  
They never let their eyebrows turn down  
They like going around with their teeth showing  
All the time  
They are from nowhere  
Your teeth are showing  
So maybe you been there  
You could have the disease of nowhere people  
Where the air gets stuck all over their gums  
When their nowhere lips roll back  
For real excitement  
They stand still  
They shut up  
Then they don't do nothing  
Out there in nowhere
