If I could be anything in the world that flew  
I would be a bat and come swooping after you  
And if the last time you were here, things were a bit askew  
Well, you know what happens after dark  
When rattlesnakes loose their skins and their hearts  
And all the missionaries loose their bark  
All the trees are calling after you  
And all the venom snipers after you  
Are all the mountains boulder after you  
  
If I could be anything of the things in this world that bite  
Instead of being a tethered ocelot on a leash  
I'd rather be your kite  
And be tied to the end of your string  
And flying in the air, babe, at night  
Because you know what they say about honey bears  
When you shave off all their baby hair  
You've got a hairy minded big bare bear  
And all the bells are rolling out for you  
And stones are all erupting out for you  
And all the cheap bloodsuckers are flying after you  
  
Yesterday, Daisy Mae and Biff were grooving down the street  
And just like in a movie, her hands became her feet  
Her belly button was her mouth  
Which meant she tasted what she'd speak  
But the funny thing is what happened to her nose  
It grew until it reached all of her toes  
Now, when people say her feet smell, they mean her nose  
And curtains laced with diamonds, dear, for you  
And kingdom's Christian sailors (soldiers), dear, for you  
And melting ice cap mountains, dear, for you  
And knights in flaming silver robes for you  
And bats, that with a kiss turn prince for you  
Swoop, swoop, oh, baby, rock, rock ...

Well I'm beginning to see the light.  
Well I'm beginning to see the light.  
Some people work very hard,  
But still they never get it right.  
Well I'm beginning to see the light.  
Well I'm beginning to see the light.  
Now I'm beginning to see the light.  
  
Wine in the morning  
And some breakfast at night.  
Well I'm beginning to see the light.  
Here we go again  
Playing the fool again.  
Here we go again  
Acting hard again.  
Well I'm beginning to see the light.  
Well I'm beginning to see the light.  
Now I'm beginning to see the light.  
  
Well I'm beginning to see the light.  
I'm beginning to see the light.  
I wore my teeth in my hands  
So I could mess the hair of the night  
Well I'm beginning to see the light.  
Hey I'm beginning to see the light.  
I met myself in a dream  
And I just want to tell you  
Everything was alright  
I'm beginning to see the light.  
Here comes two of you,  
Which one will you chose?  
One is black, one is blue.  
Don't look just what to do.  
Well I'm beginning to see the light.  
Well I'm beginning to see the light.  
Now I'm beginning to see the light.  
  
Well I'm beginning to see the light.  
Well I'm beginning to see the light.  
Some people work very hard  
But still they never get it right  
Well I'm beginning to see the light.  
There are problems in these times  
But none of them are mine  
Baby, I'm beginning to see the light.  
Here we go again,  
I thought that you were my friend.  
Here we go again,  
I thought that you were my friend.  
How does it feel to be loved?  
How does it feel to be loved?

Coyote goes to the top of the hill  
Doin' the things that coyote's will  
Staring at the sky, at the moon  
You know he starts to howl  
  
Coyote goes to the mountain top  
Looks over down at the river, says "What a drop"  
No tame dog is gonna take my bone  
  
Coyote at the top of the hill  
Doin' the things coyote's will  
You gotta cast the first stone  
Cast the first stone  
  
Jackal goes to the top of the hill  
Doin' the things that jackal's will  
Staring at the moon  
You know he starts to howl  
  
Wild dog up on the mountain top  
Blood in his jaws, the bone, he drops  
No tame dog is ever  
Ever gonna take my bone  
  
Jackal up on the top of the hill  
Doin' the things that jackal's will  
Cast the first stone  
Cast the first stone  
  
Coyote on top of the hill  
Ooohhh, doin' the things that coyote's will  
Staring at the sky, looks at the moon  
He starts to howl  
  
Coyote up on the mountain top  
Blood in his jaws, the bone, he drops  
Says no tame dog is ever  
Ever gonna take this bone  
  
Coyote up on the mountain top  
Says "What a drop"  
You gotta cast the first stone  
Cast the first stone  
Cast the first stone  
You gotta cast the first stone

Here she comes, you better watch your step  
She's going to break your heart in two, it's true  
It's not hard to realize  
Just look into her false colored eyes  
She builds you up to just put you down, what a clown  
  
'Cause everybody knows  
(She's a femme fatale)  
The things she does to please  
(She's a femme fatale)  
She's just a little tease  
(She's a femme fatale)  
See the way she walks  
Hear the way she talks  
  
You're put down in her book  
You're number thirty seven, have a look  
She's going to smile to make you frown, what a clown  
Little boy, she's from the street  
Before you start, you're already beat  
She's going to play you for a fool, yes it's true  
  
'Cause everybody knows  
(She's a femme fatale)  
The things she does to please  
(She's a femme fatale)  
She's just a little tease  
(She's a femme fatale)  
See the way she walks  
Hear the way she talks  
  
'Cause everybody knows  
(She's a femme fatale)  
The things she does to please  
(She's a femme fatale)  
She's just a little tease  
(She's a femme fatale)  
Ooh ooh oh  
(She's a femme fatale)  
Ooh ooh oh

I don't know just where I'm going  
But I'm gonna try for the kingdom, if I can  
'Cause it makes me feel like I'm a man  
When I put a spike into my vein  
And I tell you things aren't quite the same  
  
When I'm rushing on my run  
And I feel just like Jesus' son  
And I guess that I just don't know  
And I guess that I just don't know  
  
I have made big decision  
I'm gonna try to nullify my life  
'Cause when the blood begins to flow  
When it shoots up the dropper's neck  
When I'm closing in on death  
  
You can't help me now, you guys  
And all you sweet girls with all your sweet talk  
You can all go take a walk  
And I guess I just don't know  
And I guess that I just don't know  
  
I wish that I was born a thousand years ago  
I wish that I'd sailed the darkened seas  
On a great big clipper ship  
Going from this land here to that  
In a sailor's suit and cap  
  
Away from the big city  
Where a man cannot be free  
Of all the evils of this town  
And of himself and those around  
Oh, and I guess that I just don't know  
Oh, and I guess that I just don't know  
  
Heroin, be the death of me  
Heroin, it's my wife and it's my life  
Because a mainline into my vein  
Leads to a center in my head  
And then I'm better off than dead  
  
Because when the smack begins to flow  
I really don't care anymore  
About all the Jim-Jims in this town  
And all the politicians making crazy sounds  
And everybody putting everybody else down  
And all the dead bodies piled up in mounds  
  
'Cause when the smack begins to flow  
And I really don't care anymore  
Ah, when that heroin is in my blood  
And that blood is in my head  
Then thank God that I'm as good as dead  
And thank your God that I'm not aware  
And thank God that I just don't care  
And I guess I just don't know  
Oh, and I guess I just don't know

Three, four

Ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba  
Ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba  
  
I found a reason to keep livin'  
Oh, and the reason dear is you  
I found a reason to keep singin'  
Wow-woh, and the reason dear is you  
  
Oh, I do believe  
if you don't like things you leave  
For someplace you've never  
gone before  
  
Ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba  
Ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba  
  
Honey, I found a reason to keep livin'  
And you know the reason dear it's you  
And I've walked down life's lonely highways  
hand in hand with myself  
And I realize  
how many paths have crossed between us  
  
Oh, I do believe  
you are what you perceive  
What comes is better than what  
came before  
  
Oh, I do believe  
you are what you perceive  
What comes is better than what  
came before  
  
Ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba  
Ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba  
  
And you better come  
come-come, come to me  
come-come, come to me, better come  
Come-come, come to me  
Ba-ba-ba-ba  
Ba

Ever since I was on cripples Monday,  
I've got my eyeballs on my knees.  
I rapped for hours with mad Mary Williams,  
She said she never understood a word from me  
Because, I know that she cares about me,  
I heard her call my name.  
  
And I know that she's long, dead and gone,  
Still it ain't the same.  
When I wake up in the morning, mama,  
I heard her call my name.  
I know she's dead and long, gone.  
I heard her call my name.  
And then I felt my mind split open.  
  
I know that she's long, dead and gone,  
Still it ain't the same.  
When I wake up in the morning, mama,  
I heard her call my name.  
I know she's dead and long, gone.  
Still, I heard her call my name.  
And then my mind split open.

When I think of all the things I've done  
And I know that it's only just begun  
Those smiling faces  
You know, I just can't forget them  
But I love you  
  
When I think of all the things I've seen  
And I know that it's only the beginning  
You know, those smiling faces  
I just can't forget them  
But for now I love you  
  
Just for a little while  
Oh baby, just to see you smile  
Just for a little while  
  
When I think of all the things I've done  
And I know, that it's only just begun  
Oh, smiling faces, Jesus  
You know, I can't forget them  
But for now, I love you  
Watch this minute, baby  
Now I love you  
At least for now  
I love you  

I'll be your mirror  
Reflect what you are, in case you don't know  
I'll be the wind, the rain and the sunset  
The light on your door to show that you're home  
  
When you think the night has seen your mind  
That inside you're twisted and unkind  
Let me stand to show that you are blind  
Please put down your hands  
'Cause I see you  
  
I find it hard to believe you don't know  
The beauty that you are  
But if you don't let me be your eyes  
A hand in your darkness, so you won't be afraid  
  
When you think the night has seen your mind  
That inside you're twisted and unkind  
Let me stand to show that you are blind  
Please put down your hands  
'Cause I see you  
  
I'll be your mirror

I've been set free and I've been bound  
To the memories of yesterday's clouds  
I've been set free and I've been bound  
  
And now I'm set free  
I'm set free  
I'm set free to find a new illusion  
  
I've been blinded but  
You I can see  
What in the world has happened to me  
The prince of stories who walk right by me  
  
And now I'm set free  
I'm set free  
I'm set free to find a new illusion  
  
I've been set free and I've been bound  
Let me tell you people  
What I found  
I saw my head laughing  
Rolling on the ground  
  
And now I'm set free  
I'm set free  
I'm set free to find a new illusion

I'm sticking with you  
Cause I'm made out of glue  
Anything that you might do  
I'm gonna do too  
  
You held up a stage coach in the rain  
And I'm doing the same  
Saw you're hanging from a tree  
And I made believe it was me  
  
I'm sticking with you  
Cause I'm made out of glue  
Anything that you might do  
I'm gonna do too  
  
Some people go  
Into the stratosphere  
Soldiers fighting  
With the Cong  
  
But with you by my side  
I can do anything  
When we swing  
We hang past right or wrong  
  
I'll do anything for you  
Anything you want me too  
I'll do anything for you  
Oh I'm sticking with you  
Oh I'm sticking with you  
Oh I'm sticking with you

Oh, there's one thing, baby  
I just don't understand  
Two old women fighting for  
Another man  
You know it's just too much  
Ooohhh, you know it's just too much  
Oh, it's too much, baby  
And I just don't understand  
Oh, here comes mary  
Coming over the hill  
They say she won't  
But her sister will  
You know it's just too much  
Ooohhh, you know it's just too much  
You know it's too much, baby  
And I just don't understand  
Oh, rock on  
Oh, here comes my, na, na, na  
With a buckle of gold  
Everybody says, hey  
Rock your soul  
You know it's just too much  
Ooohhh, just too much  
You know it's too much, baby  
And I just don't understand  
Hey take me back now  
Baby, where I belong  
Everything, you know  
I'm doing wrong  
You know it's just too much  
Ooohhh, just too much  
Oh, you know it's too much, baby  
And I just don't understand  
Oh, just  
Everytime I'm going out  
For my thrill  
Here comes mary  
And I get no fill  
You know it's just too much  
Oh, know it's, know it's just too much  
Oh, you know it's too much, baby  
And I just don't understand  
You know it's too, too, too much  
You know it's too, too, too much  
You know it's too, too, too much  
You know it's too, too, too much  
You know it's too much, baby  
And I just don't understand  

Lady Godiva here dressed so demurely  
Pats the head of another curly haired boy, just another toy  
Sick with silence she weeps sincerely  
Saying word that have oh so clearly been said  
So long ago  
Draperies wrapped gently 'round her shoulder  
Life has made her that much bolder now  
That she's found out how  
Dressed in silk, Latin lace and envy  
Pride and joy of the latest penny faire  
Pretty passing care  
Hair today now dipped in the water  
Making love to every poor daughter's son  
Isn't it fun  
Now today propping grace with envy  
Lady Godiva peers to see if anyone's there  
And hasn't a care  
Doctor is coming the nurse thinks sweetly  
Turning on the machines that neatly pump air  
The body lies bare  
Shaved and hairless what once was screaming  
Now lies silent and almost sleeping  
The brain must have gone away  
Strapped securely to the white table  
Ether caused the body to wither and writhe  
Underneath the white light  
Doctor arrives with knife and baggage  
Sees the growth as just so much cabbage  
That now  
Must be cut away  
Now come the moment of Great! Great! Decision!  
The doctor is making his first incision  
One goes here - one goes there  
The ether tube's leaking says someone who's sloppy  
The patient it seems is not so well sleeping  
The screams echo up the hall  
Don't panic someone give him pentathol instantly  
Doctor removes his blade  
Cagily slow from the brain  
By my count of ten  
The head won't move

Lisa says that it's all right  
When she meets me at midnight  
Lisa says that she has her fun  
And she'll do it with just about anyone  
  
Lisa says  
Lisa says  
Lisa says  
Lisa says  
  
Lisa says that she's on the run  
Looking for a special one  
Lisa says that every time she makes it straight  
She knows her heart will break  
  
Lisa says  
Lisa says  
Lisa says  
Lisa says  
  
Looking for a party, some action  
Gone to make it feel okay  
But what do you mind, where the time must come on down  
Look at it all  
  
Lisa says  
Lisa says  
Lisa says  
Oh, Lisa says  
Lisa says, oh

Say a word for Jimmy Brown

Not a shirt right of his back  
He ain't got nothing at all  
And say a word for Ginger Brown

You know, I'm starting to ring again

Typically, when I had it  
Treated it like dirt  
Now, naturally, when I don't have it

Duck and Sally inside  
They're cooking for the down five  
Who're staring at Miss Rayon  
Who's busy licking up her pig pen  
I'm searching for my mainline  
I said I couldn't hit it sideways

Oh, just like Sister Ray said

They're busy waiting for her sailor  
Who says he's just as big as ever  
He says he's from Alabama  
He wants to know a way to earn a dollar  
I'm searching for my mainline

I couldn't hit it sideways  
Oh, just like Sister Ray said  
Play on  
  
Cecil's got his new piece  
He cocks and shoots between three and four  
He aims it at the sailor  
Shoots him down dead on the floor  
Oh, you shouldn't do that  
Don't you know, you'll stain the carpet?  
Now don't you know you'll stain the carpet  
And by the way, have you got a dollar  
Oh, no, man, I haven't got the time time  
Too busy sucking on a ding-dong

Oh, but I haven't got the time time  
Hey, hey, hey she's busy sucking on my ding-dong  
She's too busy sucking on my ding-dong

Some kinda love, Margarita told Tom  
Between thought and expression lies a lifetime  
Situation arise, because of the weather  
And no kinds of love are better than others  
  
Some kinda love, Margarita told Tom  
Like a dirty French novel, the absurd court the vulgar  
And some kinds of love, the possibilities are endless  
And for me to miss one would seem to be groundless  
  
I heard what you said, Margarita heard Tom  
And of course you're a bore  
But you are not charmless in  
'Cause a bore is a straight line  
That finds wealth in division  
And some kinds of love are mistaken for vision  
  
Put jelly on your shoulder, let's do what you feel most  
That, from which you recoil, but which still makes your eyes moist  
Ooooh, put jelly on your shoulder, lies down upon the carpet  
Between thought and expression, let us now kiss the culprit  
Ooooh, I don't know, just what it's all about  
Oooh, put on your red pajamas and let's find out  
Lord rock it on, long walk really satisfies  

Stephanie says  
That she wants to know  
Why she's given half her life,  
To people she hates now  
  
Stephanie says  
When answering the phone  
What country shall I say  
Is calling from across the world  
  
But she's not afraid to die,  
The people all call her Alaska  
Between worlds so the people ask her  
Cause it's all in her mind  
It's all in her mind  
  
Stephanie says  
That she wants to know  
Why it is though she's the door  
She can't be the room  
  
Stephanie says  
But doesn't hang up the phone  
What sea shell she is calling  
From across the world  
  
But she's not afraid to die,  
The people all cal her Alaska  
Between worlds so the people ask her  
Cause it's all in her mind  
It's all in her mind  
  
They're asking  
Is it good or bad  
It's such an icy feeling  
It's so cold in Alaska,  
It's so cold in Alaska,  
It's so cold in Alaska

Sweet bonnie brown, looking like a baby  
Coming down all over me  
She looked real good, like a real nice lady  
Coming down all over me  
Sweet bonnie brown (sweet bonnie brown)  
Sweet bonnie brown (sweet bonnie brown)  
Sweet bonnie brown (sweet bonnie brown)  
Oh, roll me over, like I'm coming home  
Well, she looked really like another ...  
Coming down all over me  
She looked real good, like a real low lady  
Coming down all over me, yeah  
Sweet bonnie brown (sweet bonnie brown)  
Sweet bonnie brown (sweet bonnie brown)  
Sweet bonnie brown (sweet bonnie brown)  
She looked real good, like I know she would  
I've been loving mary-ann so long  
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do  
And every time I see her, you know, I go too long  
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do  
Well, I ain't lying, baby, I ain't crying  
I've been this way for a long, long time, wow, wow ...  
Sweet bonnie brown, looking like a baby  
Coming down all over me  
She looked real good, just like a real low lady  
Coming down all over me  
Sweet bonnie brown (sweet bonnie brown)  
Sweet bonnie brown (sweet bonnie brown)  
Sweet bonnie brown (sweet bonnie brown)  
She looked real good, like I know she would  
Oh, wow, I'm up on a pony, spending all my money  
Don't you come on after me  
Oh, she looked real good, just like a real low lady  
Coming down all over me, oh  
Sweet bonnie brown  
Oh, sweet bonnie brown  
Oh, sweet bonnie brown  
She looked real good, like I know she would, oh, oh  
Oh, I've been loving mary-lou, but so long  
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do  
Everytime I know her I ....  
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do  
Well I like baby, I ain't crying  
I've been this way for a long, long, long this time, oh  
Wow, wow, oh, baby ...  

Standin' on a corner,  
Suitcase in my hand.  
Jack's in his corset, Jane she's in her vest,  
Me, babe, I'm in a rock n' roll band.  
Riding that Stutz Bearcat Jim,  
Those were different times.  
All the poets studied rules of verse,  
And the ladies, they rolled their eyes  
  
Sweet Jane, Sweet Jane, Sweet Jane  
  
Now, Jack, he is a banker,  
And Jane, she is a clerk.  
And the both of them save their money...  
And when they come home from work.  
Sittin' by the fire...  
Radio just played that classical music for all you protest kids,  
The march of the wooden soldiers  
And you can hear Jack say  
  
Sweet Jane, Sweet Jane, Sweet Jane  
  
Some people like to go out dancing  
And other people, (like me) they gotta work  
And there's even some evil mothers  
They'll tell you life is just made out of dirt.  
That women never really faint,  
That villans always blink their eyes.  
And that children are the only ones who blush.  
And that life is just to die.  
But, anyone who has a heart  
Wouldn't turn around and break it  
And anyone who ever played a part  
He wouldn't turn around and hate it  
  
Sweet Jane

Somebody shut the door  
I know where temptation lies  
Inside of you heart  
You can talk during this  
  
I know where the evil lies  
Inside of your heart  
Well get out of here  
  
If you're gonna try to make it right  
You're surely gonna end up wrong  
Wrong wrong wrong wrong  
Ah!  
  
That's the only chord I know  
I know where the mirror's edge  
Is inside of your heart  
Motown  
  
It's no even within five feet  
Well if you're gonna make it right  
You're surely gonna end up wrong  
You don't look like Martha and the Vandellas  
I'm just gonna start it all over again  
  
Somebody get her out of here  
Electricity comes from other planets  
(It's not that a bad solo. Four times is pretty together)  
(You can stay here)  
  
I know where temptation lies  
Inside of your heart  
Yes he's ready  
  
I know where the evil lies  
Inside of your heart  
Is he ready  
  
Well if you're gonna make it right  
You're surely gonna end up wrong  
  
Oh the hole mess start again  
Well New York buildings are very height  
And not all offensive  
Lock the door  
  
Gonna carry on at infinite light, my dear  
The Pope in the silver castle  
Was that awful.  
Hey, that's fine. That's it.

The myriad choices of his fate  
Set themselves out upon a plate  
For him to choose  
What had he to lose  
  
Not a ghost bloodied country  
All covered with sleep  
Where the black angel did weep  
Not an old city street in the east  
Gone to choose  
  
And wandering's brother  
Walked on through the night  
With his hair in his face  
On a long splintered cut from the knife of g.t.  
  
The rally man's patter ran on through the dawn  
Until we said so long  
To his skull-shrill yell  
  
Shining brightly red-rimmed and  
Red-lined with the time  
Infused with the choice of the mind  
On ice skates scraping chunks  
From the bells  
  
Cut mouth bleeding razor's  
Forgetting the pain  
Antiseptic remains cool goodbye  
So you fly  
To the cozy brown snow of the east  
Gone to choose, choose again  
  
Sacrificials remains make it hard to forget  
Where you come from  
The stools of your eyes  
Serve to realize fame, choose again  
  
And roverman's refrain of the sacrilege recluse  
For the loss of a horse  
Went the bowels and a tail of a rat  
Come again, choose to go  
  
And if epiphany's terror reduced you to shame  
Have your head bobbed and weaved  
Choose a side to be on  
  
If the stone glances off  
Split didactics in two  
Leave the colors of the mouse trails  
Don't scream, try between  
If you choose, if you choose, try to lose  
For the loss of remain come and start  
  
Start the game i che che che che i  
Che che ka tak koh  
Choose to choose  
Choose to choose, choose to go

There she goes again  
She's out on the streets again  
She's down on her knees, my friend  
But you know she'll never ask you please again  
  
Now take a look, there's no tears in her eyes  
She won't take it from just any guy, what can you do  
You see her walkin' on down the street  
Look at all your friends she's gonna meet  
You better hit her  
  
There she goes again  
She's knocked out on her feet again  
She's down on her knees, my friend  
But you know she'll never ask you please again  
  
Now take a look, there's no tears in her eyes  
Like a bird, you know she would fly, what can you do  
You see her walkin' on down the street  
Look at all your friends that she's gonna meet  
You better hit her  
  
Now take a look, there's no tears in her eyes  
Like a bird, you know she will fly, fly, fly away  
See her walking on down the street  
Look at all your friends that she's gonna meet  
  
She's gonna bawl and shout  
She's gonna work it  
She's gonna work it out, bye bye  
Bye bye baby  
All right

Train round the bend  
Takin me away from my country  
I'm sick of the trees  
Take me to the city  
Train comin' round the bend  
Oh train comin' round the bend  
  
Been in the country  
Oh much too long  
Trying to be a farmer  
But nothing that I planted  
Never seems to grow  
Train comin' round the bend  
Train comin' round the bend  
  
Hey I am just a city boy  
And really not the country kind  
Oh I need the city streets  
And I need your light  
To see bend comin' round the bend  
The train comin' round the bend  
  
Alright  
Ooh Ohh  
  
Once  
She's going twice  
She's going to the loop  
Up and down  
She's going twice  
She's going the train  
Comin' round the bend  
You know the train  
Comin' round the bend  
  
And I'm out of nowhere  
Takin' me back where I belong  
I've been here once  
And I don't take it tonight  
For the train comin' round the bend  
The train comin' round the bend  
Oh alright!

We're the Velvet Underground and we have come to play  
It's been 28 years since we've been here to the day  
  
There's Maureen, she's on the drums, she's havin' lot of fun  
Let's hear it for Moe Tucker, beat those skins for everyone  
  
There is Sterling Morrison, he's playing the guitar  
He's a guitar hero, kicks their asses really far  
  
Now you got here John and me  
Now you got here John and me, we want no part of this  
That's because we think it is real pretentious shit

What goes on in your mind?  
I think that I am falling down.  
What goes on in your mind?  
I think that I am upside down.  
Baby, be good, do what you should, you know it will work alright.  
Baby, be good, do what you should, you know it will be alright.  
  
I'm going up, and I'm going down.  
I'm going from side to side.  
See the bills, up in the sky,  
Somebody's cut their string in two.  
Baby, be good, do what you should, you know it will work alright.  
Baby, be good, do what you should, you know it will be alright.  
  
One minute born, one minute doomed,  
One minute up, one minute down.  
What goes on in your mind?  
I think that I am falling down.  
Baby, be good, do what you should, you know it will work alright.  
Baby, be good, do what you should, you know it will be alright.

Who loves the sun  
Who cares that it makes plants grow

Since you broke my heart  
  
Who loves the wind  
Who cares that it makes breezes  
Who cares what it does  
Since you broke my heart

Who cares that it is shining  
Who cares what it does  
Since you broke my heart
