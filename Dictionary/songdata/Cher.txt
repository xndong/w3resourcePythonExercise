What if the world was crazy and I was sane  
Would it be so strange  
I can't believe that I am alone in saying  
The things I'm saying  
I am a part of you  
  
These are universal truths  
We're all part of the light that flows through everything  
This is a different kind of love song  
Dedicated to everyone  
Different kind of love song-oh,oh  
What if the world calmed down and we could all breath  
Together easily  
Connecting the sky and the ground with you and me  
And everything in between  
I am part of you  
  
We have living proof  
There is some kind of light that flows through everything  
This is a different kind of love song  
Dedicated to everyone  
Different kind of love song-oh,oh  
This is a different kind of love song  
A higher plane we can flow on  
Different kind of love song-oh,oh

I've been standing out in the rain  
I've been calling your name  
Got that lonely feeling again  
Calling out your name  
Do you hear me? Do you want me?  
  
Baby it's all or nothing now  
I don't want to run  
And I can't walk out  
You're breaking my heart  
If you leave me now  
Don't want to wait for ever  
Who do you think you're fooling  
Who do you think you're fooling  
Baby it's all or nothing  
Baby it's all or nothing now  
  
I've been trying to get to your heart  
But I'm chasing shadows  
We keep falling further apart  
So near and you're so far  
Do you care now? Do you know how?  
  
Baby it's all or nothing now  
I don't want to run and I can't walk out  
Breaking my heart if you leave me now  
Don't want to wait forever  
Who do you think you're fooling  
Who do you think you're fooling  
Baby it's all or nothing  
Baby it's all or nothing now  
  
Sometimes when you touch me  
I just can't help myself  
Desire makes me weak  
Desire makes me weak  
Do you care now? Do you know how?

Am I blue, ah am I blue  
Ain't these tears  
In these eyes telling you  
Am I blue  
You'll be too  
I said if this plans with your man  
Done fell through  
  
Oh there was a time  
When I was, when I was he's only one  
But look at me and see now  
I'm oh I'm the sad,  
I'm the sad and lonely one  
I'm a fool and I'm the only one  
Was I gay, was I gay until today  
Oh God he's gone  
He's gone and we're through  
Am I blue  
  
There was a time there was a time  
I said there was a time  
That I was he's only one  
But right now, right now  
I'm, I'm the sad  
Of the sad and lonely one  
I'm the left behind only one  
  
Am I blue, ah am I blue  
Now he's gone and we're through  
Am I, am I blue  
Am I blue

Well I heard enough  
And I've seen enough  
And I know enough to know  
I know a good thing when I see it  
And it's a bad thing to let go  
  
Well I've been around  
I've been up and down  
Until I bailed out of control  
With your world all in motion  
Gonna put a ball  
And chain on your soul  
  
All those angels running  
Picking up the pieces  
Putting hearts together  
Broke long ago  
I know a good thing when I see it  
And it's a bad thing to let go  
  
We'll always be lovers  
With borders of there own  
And you may charge across  
In a golden chariot  
But you will never be at home  
  
'Cause I had dreams  
Like distant thunder  
I had hope like a prayer unheard  
This nothing less than perfect  
In a less than perfect world  
  
All those angles running  
Picking up the pieces  
Putting back together  
Hearts broke long ago  
I know a good thing when I see it  
And it's a bad thing to let go  
It's a bad thing to let go  
It's a bad thing

Baby I'm yours  
And I'll be yours  
Until the stars fall from the sky  
Yours until the rivers all run dry  
  
Your the one until I die  
Baby I'm yours  
And I'll be yours  
Until the sun no longer shines  
  
Yours until the poets run out of rhyme  
Your the one until the end of time  
I'm gonna stay right here  
By your side  
  
Do my best to keep you satisfied  
Nothing in the world can drive me away  
'Cause everyday you'll hear me say  
Baby I'm yours  
  
I'm gonna stay right here  
By your side  
Do my best to keep you satisfied  
Nothing in the world can drive me away  
  
'Cause everyday you'll hear me say  
Baby I'm yours  
And I'll be yours  
Until two and two is three  
  
Yours until the mountain crumbles to the sea  
Your the one until eternity  
Baby I'm yours  
Until the stars fall from the sky  
  
Baby I'm yours  
'Til the rivers all run dry  
Baby I'm yours

I was so lonely until I met you  
Told myself I'd get by without love  
Drownin' my sorrows  
Avoiding tomorrows  
And I felt that I just had enough  
Your light on my face  
And your jokes and your smiles  
And the way that you came every night  
I don't what you got  
But I'm sure glad I found you  
But I sure feels right  
Here I am  
I'm back on the street again  
Here I am  
I'm back on my feet again  
  
Surprised at myself  
By the way that I feel  
So happy that you're here with me  
Some men that I've known have left me with nothing  
But I guess that was just meant to be  
Here I am  
I'm back on the street again  
Here I am  
I'm back on my feet again  
  
I was down for the count  
I was down, I was beat, I was cryin'  
I was caught up in hate  
Hiding my face and got trying  
  
I was so lonely until I met you  
Told myself I'd get by without love  
Drownin' my sorrows  
Avoiding tomorrows  
And I felt like I just had enough  
Here I am  
I'm back on the street again  
Here I am  
I'm back on my feet again

No matter how hard I try  
You keep pushing me aside  
And I can't break through  
There's no talking to you  
It's so sad that you're leaving  
It takes time to believe it  
But after all is said and done  
You're gonna be the lonely one

Bell bottom blues you made me cry  
And I don't want to lose this feeling  
And if I could choose a place to die  
Oh, it would be in your arms  
  
[Chorus:]  
Do you want to see me crawl  
Across the floor to you (do ya wanna)  
And do you want to hear me  
Beg you to take me back  
I'm beggin' baby  
Cause I don't want to fade away  
Give me one more day,  
Please I don't want to fade away  
I don't want to fade away  
In your arms I wanna stay  
  
It's all wrong but it's all right  
The way that you do me, baby  
Once I was strong, but I lost the fight  
Whoa, and you won't find a better loser  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Bell bottom blues don't you say goodbye  
Sure we're gonna meet again  
And if we, when you do  
Don't you be surprised  
If you find me with another lover  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Won't you  
Won't you give me one more day, please

How many roads most a man walk down  
Before you call him a man?  
How many seas must a white dove sail  
Before she sleeps in the sand?  
Yes, how many times must the cannon balls fly  
Before they're forever banned?  
The answer my friend is blowin' in the wind  
The answer is blowin' in the wind  
  
Yes, how many years can a mountain exist  
Before it's washed to the sea?  
Yes, how many years can some people exist  
Before they're allowed to be free?  
Yes, how many times can a man turn his head  
Pretending he just doesn't see?  
The answer my friend is blowin' in the wind  
The answer is blowin' in the wind  
  
Yes, how many times must a man look up  
Before he can see the sky?  
Yes, how many ears must one man have  
Before he can hear people cry?  
Yes, how many deaths will it take till he knows  
That too many people have died?  
The answer my friend is blowin' in the wind  
The answer is blowin' in the wind

Body to body, body to body  
Heart to heart  
Body to body, body to body  
Heart to heart  
  
Looking in your eyes tonight  
I can see everything I need  
Holding your heart close to mine  
Feeling you, breathing you  
We melt together, two become as one  
Night is burning hotter than the sun  
When I'm with you  
When I'm with you  
  
I could drown in your eyes  
Die in your arms  
Live for these moments here in the dark  
I don't know where I end  
Not sure where you start  
When we're body to body, heart to heart  
Body to body, heart to heart  
Body to body, body to body  
Heart to heart  
  
Breathing every breath with you  
Next to you is where I need to be  
Part of every part of you  
Feeling you feeling me  
We melt together in a tender kiss  
No night has ever been a night like this  
When I'm with you  
When I'm with you  
  
I could drown in your eyes  
Die in your arms  
Live for these moments here in the dark  
I don't know where I end  
Not sure where you start  
When we're body to body, heart to heart  
Body to body, heart to heart  
Body to body, body to body  
Heart to heart

When people say, you're not my kind  
And that your clothes are out of line  
And that your hair isn't combed all the time  
You're not real pretty but you're mine  
  
We have a great big old society  
That won't make room for folks  
Like you and me  
But I got some real sad news  
For them my friend  
They're on the outside looking in  
  
We've got a great thing going  
And it's gonna keep right on growing  
And I hope that soon they'll see the light  
But until that time  
They'll have to blow their mind  
Cause it ain't us that's gonna lose this fight  
So when we're walking I don't care  
When all those people stop and stare  
If they'd look in your eyes they'd see  
You're not real pretty but you belong to me  
  
Hey hey hey now  
Hey hey hey now  
When you're lovin' me baby  
And when I hold you baby  
(When you kiss you)  
I know you love me baby  
(When I hold you)  
You know I'll never leave you  
(When I touch you)  
I know I'll always love you  
(Every day now)  
You know I love you baby  
You know I love you baby

I gotta go on my way by myself  
Because this is the end of romance  
I gotta go my way all by myself  
Love it's only it's only a dance  
I'm gonna try to apply myself  
And teach my poor heart how to sing  
I gotta go I want to go my way all by myself  
Just like just like a bird on a wing  
I'm gonna face the unknown  
I'm gonna feel, I'm gonna feel  
The way on my own  
Cause nobody knows better than I myself  
You see I'm by myself all alone  
  
I gotta go I gotta go on my way by myself  
This is the end, the end  
The end, end of romance  
I gotta go I gotta go my way all by myself  
Love is only a dance  
Cause I gotta go, I gotta see  
I gotta try my own thing by myself  
And teach my poor heart how to sing  
I gotta go I gotta try  
My own thing all by myself  
Just like a bird I'm out on a wing  
I'm gonna face the unknown  
I'm want to feel I gotta feel I want to feel  
A world of my own  
Nobody nobody knows better than I myself  
You see I'm by myself all alone

In the chilly hours and minutes  
Of uncertainty  
I want to be  
In the warm hold of  
Your love and mine  
  
To feel you all around me  
And to take your hand  
Along the sand  
Ah, but I may as well try  
And catch the wind  
  
When the sundown pales the sky  
I want hide a while  
Behind your smile  
Everywhere I look  
Your eyes I'd find  
  
For me to love you now  
Would be the sweetest thing  
It would make me sing  
Ah, but I may as well try  
And catch the wind  
  
Ooh  
When rain has hung  
The leaves with tears  
I want you near  
To kill my fears  
And help me to leave all  
My blues behind  
  
Standing in your heart  
Is where I want to be  
And long to be  
Ah, but I may as well try  
And catch the wind  
  
Ooh  
Ah, but I may as well try  
And catch the wind  
  
Ooh

Chastity Sun, you are the one  
That can make me smile  
When I'm feeling sad  
You come close to me  
And my heart goes running free  
You are the proof God lives  
You are his gift to me  
  
Sweet baby girl  
You make my world  
Bright and shinning new  
When I look at you  
In your eyes I see  
The world that God meant to be  
There's no hate or angry  
Just love for humanity  
  
We'll have children of the kingdom  
They won't be torn by war, torn by hate  
Nor will they hesitate to love  
  
Chastity Sun, we are as one  
You have come from me  
You're the fruit, I'm the tree  
I am trying so  
But I've got so far to go  
I've got so much to teach you  
And so much myself to know  
  
Sweet baby one  
You bring the sun in a simple way  
With the things you say  
In my smile or tears  
Such innocents in your heart  
You make up God's great circle  
'Cause I am the end and you're the start  
  
We'll have children of the kingdom  
They won't be torn by war  
Nor will they kill or hate  
Or hesitate to love

Wind up when a band of thieves  
Making my way across town  
Lost in a manner of speech  
Making my way across town  
What about the good life  
That I have been expecting for so long  
What about the good life  
  
Hush about my lonesome child  
Don't cha cry  
Momma's gonna bring you something  
Gonna get you high  
Never you mind how I came here  
I just knew someone was laying here  
Cause you buy  
  
So long I carried this load  
Feel like I never been born  
So long I traveled this road  
Feel like I'm really worn  
What about the good life  
That I have been expecting for so long  
What about the good life  
  
Hush about my lonesome child  
Don't cha cry  
Momma's gonna bring you something  
Gonna get you high  
Never you mind how I came here  
I just knew someone was laying here  
Cause you buy  
  
So long I carried this load  
Feel like I never been born  
So long I traveled this road  
Feel like I'm really worn  
What about the good life  
That I have been expecting for so long  
What about the good life  
  
What about the good times  
What about the good times  
What about the good times  
What about the good times  
What about the good times  
What about the good times  
What about the good times  
What about the good times

Cheryl'S going home  
Writer Bob Lind  
  
The thunder cracks against the night, the dark explodes with yellow light  
The railroad sign is flashing bright, the people stare but I don't care  
My flesh is cold against my bones  
My Cheryl's going home  
Come hear me shout against the rain, is there a way to stop this train  
I got some reasons to explain  
About the way I was today  
The whistle moans and I'm alone  
My Cheryl's going home  
Santa Rose Special's down the line  
I'm running desperately behind  
There's only one thing on my mind  
The rain and tears are in my eyes  
The things I have to say won't be known  
My Cheryl's going home  
[Repeat 1st and 2nd verses]

Its Christmas, baby please come home,  
Its Christmas, baby please come home,  
  
Christmas,  
The snow's coming down,  
I'm watching it fall,  
Lots of people around,  
Baby please come home.  
  
Christmas,  
The church bells in town  
Are ringing of snow,  
What a happy sound,  
Baby please come home.  
  
(chorus)  
They're singing deck the hall,  
But its not like christmas at all,  
Coz I remember when you were here  
And all the fun we had last year  
  
Christmas,  
Pretty lights on the trees  
I'm Watching them shine,  
You should be here with me,  
Baby please come home,  
Baby please come home,  
Baby please come home,  
Baby please come home.  
  
(repeat chorus)  
If there was a way,  
I'd hold back each tear,  
But its Christmas day,  
Baby please come home.  
  
(repeat chorus)  
If there was a way,  
I'd hold back each tear,  
But its Christmas day,  
Baby please come home.  
  
(repeat chorus)  
If there was a way,  
I'd hold back each tear,  
But its Christmas day,  
Baby please come home.  
  
OH baby please come home  
Baby please  
Baby please  
Baby please come home  
  
Pretty lights on the trees  
I'm watching them shine,  
You should be here with me  
Baby please come home,  
Baby please come home,  
Baby please come home,  
Baby please come home,  
Baby please come home.  
  
Christmas.

I know now, how much I love you  
I knew it surely  
When I saw my blood  
I cried with my wet eyes  
I said I love you  
I said I love you dying in the mud  
It's funny you know  
I'm not the one that feels bad  
Some guy is gonna knock  
At our front door  
Honey he's gonna try  
And tell you in a nice way  
That Mrs., your not Mrs. anymore  
  
Just one more time  
I wish that I could see you  
Just one more time  
I wish that you were near  
Just one more time  
I wish that you could hear me  
But bitterness won't make me reappear  
  
I love you, my God, how I love you  
I see you all around me  
It's time now  
It's time to say good night  
But this time, my love  
I won't have to get up and fight  
I love you

I'll send away all my false pride  
And I'll forsake all of my life  
Yes I'll be as true as true can be  
If you'll come and stay with me  
  
All lovers of the past, I'll leave behind  
They'll never be another on my mind  
I'll do all I can so you'll feel free  
If you'll come and stay with me  
  
The promise I made most faithfully  
I'll keep still if you decide to leave  
I'll try and see that you have all you need  
If you'll come and stay with me  
  
Yes I'll be as true as true can be  
If you'll come and stay with me  
  
Live a life no others have ever known  
But I know you think that I'm hardly grown  
Oh thank God at last and finally  
I can see you're gonna stay with me  
I can see you're gonna stay with me

I'm leaving in the quiet early morning  
When night has left the sky  
Before the dew is dry  
But it's not like it used to be  
I'm leaving you this warning  
You're gonna live to see the day  
You long for me  
  
Come to your window  
It ain't too late to come  
Into your side again  
Don't make me believe you  
Before you let me have  
A chance to try again  
Or I'll be gone before  
You ever know you're losing me  
  
I know I've made mistakes  
That bought you sorrow  
But baby, keep in mind  
You're not right all the time  
Don't let me go away  
To face a new tomorrow  
Back where you bought me from  
When I was glad to come  
  
[Chorus:]  
Come to your window  
Look down and see the teardrops  
In my desperate eyes  
Look how I need you  
I got to find a way to make you realize  
That you are casting out  
The deepest love you'll ever know  
  
Please don't close your ears  
To what I'm saying  
Before I ride away into the early day  
I spent the lonesome evening hours praying  
That you will change your mind  
And try me one more time  
  
Come to your window  
Before our love comes crashing  
Into pieces on the ground  
Don't let it happen  
I promise you this time  
I'll never let you down  
Give me a cause to come  
To your lonesome arms again  
  
[Chorus:]

Elijah:  
  
Ohhhh  
  
Now I don't hardly know her  
But I think I could love her  
Crimson and clover  
  
Ahhhhh  
  
She would ya' come walkin' over  
Now I been waitin' to show her  
Crimson and clover  
Over and over  
  
Cher:  
  
Yeeeeeah  
  
Yeah my mind's such a sweet thing  
Wanna do everything  
What a beautiful feeling  
  
Crimson and clover  
Over and over  
  
Crimson and clover  
Over and over X10

When I think about the good love you gave to me  
I cry like a baby  
Living without you is driving me crazy  
I cry like a baby  
Lord knows now that you're not a plaything  
Not a toy or a puppet on a string  
  
When I think about a love so sweet now  
I cry like a baby  
Every road is a lonely street now  
I cry like a baby  
Lord knows now that I'm not a plaything  
Not a toy or a puppet on a string  
  
Today we passed on the street  
And you just walked on by  
My heart just fell to my feet  
And once again I began to cry  
  
When I think about the good love you gave to me  
I cry like a baby  
Living without you is driving me crazy  
I cry like a baby  
Lord knows now that you're not a plaything  
Not a toy or a puppet on a string  
  
When I think about a love so sweet now  
I cry like a baby  
You left done a lot of running  
I cry like a baby  
When I think about a love so sweet now  
I cry like a baby

Love walk out the door  
Its a cryin shame  
It don't happen no more  
Love walk out the door  
Its a cryin shame  
It don't happen no more  
  
Im Readin your letter  
I don't know weather  
To call you up and talk again.  
When i saw the name you signed  
Goin through my mind it was a memory  
Of way back when.  
  
Now All That I can tell you is good luck baby  
Im sorry that it couldnt be me,  
Cause it felt to right and if we held on tight  
Id be with you tonight.  
  
We never should have let our  
Love walk out the door  
Its a cryin shame  
It don't happen no more  
  
Love walk out the door  
Its a cryin shame  
It don't happen no more  
  
I wont forget the summer  
My heart was like a drummer  
Just beating every night away  
Walkin in the sun with you  
Baby we were one i knew  
Love was really ours to stay  
  
Now all that i have left is a faded picture,  
You belong to her today  
And the memory of you and me  
Is just a used to be,  
  
We never should have let our  
Love walk out the door  
Its a cryin shame  
It don't happen no more  
  
Love walk out the door  
Its a cryin shame  
It don't happen no more  
Shame it don't happen  
  
Love slipped through my hands  
Its a cryin shame  
I can't play in your band  
Love fell at my feet it's a cryin shame  
The bitter is in the sweet  
  
Oh no..oh no  
  
Love walk out the door  
Its a cryin shame  
It don't happen no more  
  
Love walk out the door  
Its a cryin shame  
It don't happen no more

I don't know if it's in my mind  
Watching all the shadows behind me  
'Cause I could get hurt  
Or maybe this time  
The cloud has got a silver lining  
And if I'm scared, I got a right to be  
I know, you could wound me critically  
  
[Chorus]  
These are dangerous times  
And if I take some chances  
Put my heart on the line  
What would you do to me  
If I give myself up  
To these circumstances  
In these dangerous times  
Would you keep me safely  
  
Over the hill, there's an army of fools  
Waiting for their hearts to be broken  
How do I know  
If I'm gonna explode  
When I come out in the open  
'Cause even lovers can turn into enemies  
I don't want to be a casualty  
  
[Chorus]  
Would you keep me  
  
Baby would you keep me safely tonight  
Can I trust you with all of my affections?  
Can I trust you to be on my side?  
In these dangerous times  
  
[Chorus: x 2]

Oh Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling  
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side  
The summer's gone, and all the roses are dying  
It's you, It's you must go and I must bide  
  
But come ye back when summer's in the meadow  
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow  
For I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow  
Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so  
  
But when ye come and all the flowers are a dying  
And if I am dead, dead I well may be  
Just come and find, find the place  
Find the place where I lay lying  
And kneel and say an "Ave" there for me  
  
And I will hear tho soft you tread above me  
And my grave, my grave warmer and sweeter be  
For you're gonna kneel and you're gonna tell  
God you're gonna tell me how you loved me  
And I will sleep in peace until you come to me

Won't you let me rock and roll you baby  
I haven't seen you in a long, long time  
I haven't fooled around with any candles lately  
Just thought you might have some music in mind  
Oh, I just want to serenade you  
Maybe we could even live a verse or two  
And I could finish this old love song  
So I could start singing it to you, oh  
I could start singing it to you  
If I could finish this old love song  
Then I could start singing it to you  
Won't you come and boogie-woogie with me, baby  
It's been a while since I held you close to me  
I haven't met many boys like you, baby  
Knew I would find you eventually  
Oh, I just want to serenade you  
Maybe we could even live a verse or two  
And I could finish this old love song  
So I could start singing it to you, oh baby  
I could start singing it to you, oh honey  
If I could finish this old love song  
Then I could start singing it to you  
If I could finish this old love song  
Then I could start singing it  
Then I could start singing it to you  
Oh, to you, oh, to you baby, you  
I said, to you  

Meat Loaf feat. Cher - Dead Ringer For Love  
  
Meatloaf: Every night I grab some money and I go down to the bar  
I got my buddies and a beer, I got a dream, I need a car  
You got me begging on my knees, c'mon and throw the dog a bone  
A man he doesn't live by rock 'n roll and brew alone  
Baby baby, baby baby  
  
Rock 'n roll and brew, rock 'n roll and brew  
They don't mean a thing when I compare 'em next to you  
Rock 'n roll and brew, rock 'n roll and brew  
I know that you and I we got better things to do  
I don't know who you are or what you do, or where you go when you're not
around  
I don't know anything about you baby, but you're everything I'm dreaming of  
I don't know who you are, but you're a real dead ringer for love  
A real dead ringer for love  
  
Cher: Ever since I can remember you been hanging 'round this joint  
You been trying to look away but now you finally got the point  
I don't have to know your name and I won't tell you what to do  
But a girl she doesn't live by only rock 'n roll and brew  
Baby baby, baby baby  
  
Cher and Meatloaf: Rock 'n roll and brew, rock 'n roll and brew  
They don't mean a thing when I compare 'em next to you  
Rock 'n roll and brew, rock 'n roll and brew

I don't know who you are or what you do, or where you go when you're not

I don't know anything about you baby, but you're everything I'm dreaming of  
I don't know who you are, but you're a real dead ringer for love  
A real dead ringer for love  
  
Meatloaf: Ooh you got the kind of legs that do more than walk  
Cher: I don't have to listen to your whimpering talk  
Meatloaf: Listen you got the kind of eyes that do more than see  
Cher: You got a lotta nerve to come on to me  
Meatloaf: You got the kind of lips that do more than drink  
Cher: You got the kind of mind that does less than think  
But since I'm feeling kinda lonely and my defenses are low  
Why don't we give it a shot and get it ready to go  
I'm looking for anonymous and fleeting satisfaction  
I want to tell my daddy I'll be missing in action  
Ever since I can remember I've been hanging 'round this joint  
My daddy never noticed, now he'll finally get the point  
Meatloaf: You got me beggin' on my knees, c'mon and throw the dog a bone  
A man he doesn't live by rock 'n roll and brew alone  
Baby baby, baby, baby  
  
Cher and Meatloaf: Rock 'n roll and brew, rock 'n roll and brew  
I know that you and I we got better things to do  
Rock 'n roll and brew, rock 'n roll and brew  
They don? T mean a thing when I compare? Em next to you  
I don't know who you are or what you do, or where you go when you're not
around  
I don't know anything about you baby, but you're everything I'm dreaming of  
I don't know who you are, but you're a real dead ringer for love  
A real dead ringer for love  
  
Dead ringer for love  
Dead ringer

If you're gonna make an omelet  
You gotta break an egg  
You want to be in showbiz  
Then you gotta break a leg  
  
Babe you're heading on a journey  
I hate to see you make  
Cause the only food they sell there  
Is called Disaster Cake  
  
You won't plan it or deserve it  
When life sneaks behind your back  
It'll grab you by the short hairs  
And gently tie you to the rack  
  
If you think you can outrun it  
That'll be your first mistake  
'Cause the recipe you're making  
Is for Disaster Cake  
  
Read my lips  
Babe the crack that you hear is thunder  
You don't know, but you're going under  
Read my lips  
Babe the flash that you see is lightinin'  
I have been up ahead, it's frightenin'  
Yeah you're young and you're cool  
Here to break evey rule - you're a fool  
  
Now you won't listen or believe me  
When I tell you what's a head  
I'm a dinosaur in your mind  
I've never even seen "The Dead"  
  
But child read my lips and tremble  
'Cause your world is about to break  
And the crumbs they're selling after  
Are from Disaster Cake  
  
Read my lips  
Girl you're heading for a disaster  
You run fast, you need to run faster  
Read my lips  
'Cause you're an accident waiting to happen  
This is death bitch, it ain't just nappin'  
Yeah you're young and you're cool  
But hell's full of young fool's  
Rest in peace  
  
Yeah I know you're tired of listenin'  
And you wish I'd just go away  
If I do you'll be alone here  
And then you'll beg my ass to stay  
  
Babe, life's a paradox for certain  
Like trying to fuck through an earthquake  
Simpler task than eating  
An ent

Wish I was in the land of cotton  
There's a man waiting there  
Who'll never be forgotten  
Why did I have to go  
Why did I go away  
  
It was early on one frosty morning  
I left the sleepy town I was born in  
I wrote a letter that said I was going  
And I layed it beside your bed  
  
And now the concrete hurts my feet  
New York's too big a city for me  
Back down south from Dixie beside you  
Honey is where I wanna be  
  
[Chorus:]  
And then my cotton gown'll come tumblin' down  
I'll make ya feel like a hell of a man  
I wanna be held tight in your arms tonight  
In my sweet old Dixie land  
Darling it seems like forever  
Does the Mississippi still run free  
I miss a little bit of Heaven  
And your southern hospitality  
  
These neon lights drive me crazy  
I wanna lay next to you and be lazy  
Where the sweet magnolia blossoms  
In the early morning Georgia air  
  
Tonight it looks like snow  
But this Gray Hound's starting to roll  
I gonna be whistelin' Dixie  
All the way back home to you  
  
[Chorus x2]

Do I ever cross your mind darling  
Do you ever see  
Some situation somewhere somehow  
Triggers your memory  
And do you ever wonder  
What became of all the time  
And darling, do I ever cross your mind  
  
Do you ever want to know  
If all dreams go on endlessly  
Or do they just run down somehow  
Gradually become the custody  
Or that melancholy jaded by the time  
And darling, do I ever, ever cross your mind  
  
Do I ever cross your mind  
When you're lonely  
Or does that only happen to me  
Darling don'tcha ever wonder  
What became of all the time  
And darling, do I ever, ever cross your mind

Take me to heart  
And I'll always love you  
And nobody can make me do wrong  
Take me for granted  
Leaving love unshown  
Makes will power weak  
And temptation strong  
  
[Chorus:]  
A woman's only human  
You should understand  
She's not just a plaything  
She's flesh and blood  
Just like her man  
If you want a do right all's day woman  
You gotta be a do right all's night man  
  
They say it's a man's world  
But you can't prove that by me  
And as long as we're together  
Show some respect for me  
If you want a do right all's day woman  
You gotta be a do right all's night man  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
If you want a do right all's day woman  
You gotta be a do right all's night man  
If you want a do right all's day woman  
You gotta be a do right all's night man

Do what you gotta do  
With greg allman  
Writer jimmy webb  
  
Girl I can understand how it might be kinda hard to love a guy like me  
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free  
I just wanted you to know  
I love you better than your own kin did from the very start  
It's my own fault for what happens to my heart  
You see I've always known you'd go  
But you just do what you gotta do  
My wild sweet love  
Though it may mean I'll never kiss your sweet lips again  
Pay that no mind  
Just find that dappled dream of yours  
Come on back and see me when you can  
Well I know they make you sad  
They make you feel so bad  
They say you don't treat me like you should  
Folks got ways to make you feel no good  
I guess they got no way to know  
I've had my eyes wide open from the start  
And boy you never lied to me  
And the part of you they'll never see  
Is the part you've shown to me  
So you just do what you gotta do  
My wild sweet love  
Though it may mean I'll never kiss those sweet lips again  
Pay that no mind  
Just find that dappled dream of yours  
Come on back and see me  
Come on back and see me  
Come on back see me when you can-oooooooooh

I walked down the street  
People passing me by  
They look me up and down  
But they don't look me in the eye  
I'm just another stranger  
  
In my own home town  
Looking for an angel  
But heaven can't be found  
I say, hey, are you lonlely tonight?  
hey, hey, hey, I'm gonna make it through  
  
But that don't make it right  
Does anybody really fall in love anymore?  
Does anybody really give their heart to somebody?  
Does anybody really ever open that door?  
I know, I know, you've got to love somebody  
I know, I know, I've got to find somebody to love  
There's a sad face in the mirror  
  
And I'm sad to say it's mine  
Like a ghost up in the attic  
Only love can set him free  
I've been running around in circles  
On this roller coaster ride  
There's a lonely world around me  
I get sucked in by the tide  
I say, hey, love ain't no crime  
  
So why is everybody so afraid to cross that line?  
Does anybody really fall in love anymore?  
Does anybody really give their heart to somebody?  
Does anybody really ever open that door?  
I know, I know, you've got to love somebody  
I know, I know, I've got to find somebody to love  
  
Hey, hey, hey, I'll be alright  
'Cause I know that someone some where's  
Gonna say these words tonight  
Does anybody really fall in love anymore?  
Does anybody really give their heart to somebody?  
Does anybody really ever open that door?  
I know, I know, you've got to love somebody  
I know, I know, I've got to find somebody to love

I bring a paper  
To the cafe on the corner  
I catch a movie in the afternoon  
I spend an hour  
Doing nothing that important  
But nothing's what I'm in the mood to do  
This peaceful image  
Of a seen almost forgotten  
Just touched the surface  
Of my conscious mind  
Of things I used to do  
Before I knew you  
[Chorus:]  
So don't come around here tonite  
But that doesn't mean forever  
I trust you to spare us a fight  
And humour my endeavour  
There was something about you to me  
How easier love used to be  
Well I just need to know  
That I'm all right  
If you don't come around tonite  
And so I wander  
Through the workings of the city  
Where every stranger has discovered me  
With my desire, my isolation  
Somehow I have to make the two agree  
And then you vanish  
All my thoughts and independance  
When you put your hands on me  
And I feel these things you do  
That I've grown used to  
[Chorus:]  
You say I'm the one  
You've been searching for  
But for myself I would rather be more  
Then someone who only aspires  
To forfeit your every desire  
And nights I've been mad, you are few  
Now, all I am asking of you, is  
[Chorus:]  
[repeat]

Throw out our love  
Like it was old news  
Be sure to wear your best pair  
Of walking out shoes  
Go take the world  
Into your hot hands  
You want the music baby,  
Go have the dance  
Ooh when you miss my love  
And you're thinking about  
How good it use to be  
Ooh when you long for my touch  
[Chorus:]  
Baby please don't come crying to me  
Remember you were the one  
Who wanted to be free  
That's how you wanted to be  
So don't come crying,  
Don't come crying to me  
Don't you come crying  
Walk out the door and go on and go free  
Step on my heart like  
It's the ground under your feet  
Find another lover if you want to  
You got to do whatever you got to do  
Ooh but when the nights get cold  
And you're thinking about  
How hot we used to be  
Ooh and when there's no one to hold  
[Chorus x3]

You know you love your man  
Two hundred miles an hour  
Drinking up the fumes  
And you're never more alive  
When you feel his power  
You gotta have it today  
Cause a woman gets hot  
You're racing for the man in the cloak  
Ah you're living your life on fire  
You see, but it's out of bounds company  
  
[Chorus]  
(Fast company)  
I with the lights, heart beats  
Dancing to the music  
Lord I just burst into fire  
No wonder I can't sleep  
I got a feeling today  
I wanna get all hot  
All my dreams explodes with a shot  
Lord I'd be living  
My life on the Caribbean Sea  
But it's out of bounds company  
  
(Fast company)  
You see you're on the way to come  
You say you're one your way to go  
Baby the heart's speaking paradise  
But you - Help me  
Get your big life  
Fast company  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Fast company)  
You see you're on the way to come  
You say you're one your way to go  
Baby the heart's speaking paradise with me  
Fast Company

Just yesterday morning they let me know you were gone  
Susan the plans they made put an end to you  
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song  
I just can't remember who to send it to  
  
I've seen fire and I've seen rain  
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end  
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend  
But I always thought that I'd see you again  
  
Won't you look down upon me, Jesus  
You've got to help me make a stand  
You've just got to see me through another day  
My body's aching and my time is at hand  
And I won't make it any other way  
  
Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain  
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end  
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend  
But I always thought that I'd see you again  
  
Been walking my mind to an easy time my back turned towards the sun  
Lord knows when the cold wind blows it'll turn you head around  
Well, there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come  
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground  
  
Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain  
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end  
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend  
But I always thought that I'd see you, baby, one more time again, now  
Thought I'd see you one more time again

Here comes old Rosie she's looking mighty fine  
Here comes hot Nancy she's steppin' right on time  
There go the street lights bringin on the night  
Well they'll be slipping into darkness slipping out of sight  
All through the shadows they come and they go  
Only one thing in common  
They got the fire down below  
  
Here comes the rich man in his long black limousine  
Here comes the poor man all you got to have is green  
Here comes the lawyer, banker and the cop  
One thing for certain it ain't never gonna stop  
When it all gets too heavy  
That's when they come and go  
Only one thing in common  
They got the fire down below  
  
It happens out in Vegas happens in Moline  
On the blue blood streets of Boston  
Up in Berkeley and out in Queens  
And it went on yesterday and it's going on tonight  
Somewhere there's somebody ain't treatin' somebody right  
  
And he's looking out for Rosie and she's looking mighty fine  
And he's walking the streets for Nancy  
And he'll find her everytime  
When the street light flicker bringing on the night  
Well they'll be slipping into darkness slipping out of sight  
All through the midnight  
Watch 'em come and watch 'em go  
Only one thing in common  
They got the fire down below

Oh, brother, man where are you?  
I am bucklin' from the load.  
I have lost my eye for color  
And my heart can't see the road.  
Oh, sister, come and catch me  
Cause my legs, their prime has past.  
I am breaking from the sorrow  
And my faith is fadin' fast.  
Mother, father, help me  
I'm your flesh and blood and bone.  
Don't you hear me?  
Can't you see me?  
Am I doomed to live alone?  
Without warmth, or love, or honor  
Like a dog out on the street,  
Am I trash 'cause I can't manage  
Must I grovel at your feet?  
  
I'm the boy who fought your battles  
And I'm the man who won your wars.  
Is it over?  
Have you used me?  
I'm no value anymore?  
  
I'm your mothers,  
Wives, and daughters  
I'm your fathers, husbands, sons,  
I'm the life's blood of this country  
I'm the hopeful precious ones.  
  
Am I nothing,  
Am I no one?  
Once a fabric,  
Now a rag.  
We treat people like they're nothing  
We're not fit to fly,  
Fit to fly  
No, no, no, no, no, no.  
  
We're not fit to fly,  
Fit to fly a flag (no, no, no)  
Join the Army,  
See the world  
The Marine Corps,  
Join the Navy  
We're not fit to fly  
Fit to fly the flag.

Flashback  
Writers jennifer hanson, jim patton-Johnson  
  
You were born between a rock and a hard place  
To a couple of losers  
I lived on the other side of your duplex  
I heard you getting those bruises  
I never would've wanted to walk in your shoes  
It scared me to death, I was a kid too  
Sometimes I think about you  
Travis are you out there somewhere  
Searching for somebody to care  
Are you doing the same thing  
That your daddy did to you  
Wish I could have helped you somehow  
Wonder if it's just too late now  
Saw your pain, how come nobody  
Seemed to have a clue  
Is your world still black and blue  
Travis, Travis  
Did you follow in your mama's footsteps  
Strung out on bad things  
Just a product of circumstances  
Never taught what love means  
Travis I hope you did it different this time  
All you had to do was make up your mind  
Well, how did you decide to live your life  
Travis are you out there somewhere  
Searching for somebody to care  
Are you doing the same thing  
That your daddy did to you  
Wish I could have helped you somehow  
Wonder if it's just too late now  
Saw your pain, how come nobody  
Seemed to have a clue  
Is your world still black and blue  
Travis, Travis  
And the circle goes round  
Until someone hears the sound  
Of a breaking heart  
Wish I could have helped you somehow  
Wonder if it's just too late  
Saw your pain, how come nobody  
Seemed to have a clue  
Is your world still black and blue  
Travis, Travis, Travis, Travis, Travis

There's something happening here  
What it is ain't exactly clear  
There's a man with a gun over there  
Telling me I got to beware  
I think it's time we stop, children, what's that sound  
Everybody look what's going down  
There's battle lines being drawn  
Nobody's right if everybody's wrong  
Young people speaking their minds  
Getting so much resistance from behind  
I think it's time we stop, hey, what's that sound  
Everybody look what's going down  
What a field-day for the heat  
A thousand people in the street  
Singing songs and carrying signs  
Mostly say, hooray for our side  
It's time we stop, hey, what's that sound  
Everybody look what's going down  
Paranoia strikes deep  
Into your life it will creep  
It starts when you're always afraid  
You step out of line, the man come and take you away  
We better stop, hey, what's that sound  
Everybody look what's going down  
Stop, hey, what's that sound  
Everybody look what's going down  
Stop, now, what's that sound  
Everybody look what's going down  
Stop, children, what's that sound  
Everybody look what's going down

I know you're a gamester  
I'm the queen of spades  
A ruler of hearts  
Clash at the moon  
I take my trips right from the start  
I'm a sucker for love  
Joker running wild  
My heart it can break  
Ooh it can break  
Frail as a child  
  
[Chorus]  
Whatever it is, it is  
Whatever will be, it's gonna be  
Whoever you are, you are  
But those games that you play  
Don't cha play 'em with me  
  
You're a visionary dreamer  
Fool in a state, takes of chance  
Love is a hazard, ooh such a hazard  
When you flirt with romance  
It's like shootin' the dice  
Flip a coin in the air  
You running on luck  
Odds are against you  
You're not playing fair  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Stacking a deck, dealing the cards  
Watch what you take  
Standing on love

Put geronimo in jail down south  
Where he couldn't look  
A gift horse in the mouth  
Took old geronimo by storm  
Ripped off the feathers from his uniform  
Chorus:  
Oh boys, take me back  
I wanna ride in geronimo's cadillac  
Oh boys, take me back  
I wanna ride in geronimo's cadillac  
Sergeant, sergeant, oh don't you feel  
There's something wrong with your automobile  
Warden, warden, oh listen to me  
Be brave and set geronimo free  
Governor, governor, oh isn't it strange  
You never seen a car on the indian range  
(chorus)  
People, people, oh don't you know  
The indian's got no place to go  
Jesus told me, and I believe it's true  
The red man's in the sunset too  
Took our land, now they won't give it back  
They sent geronimo a cadillac  
(chorus)  

So you wanna throw our love away  
So you think we ought-a say goodbye  
And you tell me we've run out-a time  
Can't make a heart, stop on a dime  
You could always walk away  
Like you never saw my face  
If you wanted to  
You could tell yourself a lie  
Say this love ain't worth a try  
But you know isn't true  
You heart is tellin' you  
  
Chorus:  
Whoa... We gotta take a stand  
Give our love a fightin' chance  
We can talk it over baby  
Woman to man  
Give our love a fightin' chance  
A fightin' chance  
  
So you think you'll wish it all away  
Click your heels and leave it all behind  
But you don't know that in the real world  
You gotta fight to keep love alive  
There's a battle to be won  
And if bother our hearts are strong  
We can make it through  
So don't turn your back and run  
'Cause your heart's under the gun  
It's a case of do or die  
Break down the walls of pride  
  
Chorus

Baby don't you worry  
When things ain't going right  
Don't be in a hurry  
To run away when you're uptight  
Love is sweet if we stick together  
Solve our problems for forever  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause we got a good combination  
Yeah we got a good combination  
Can't you see you and me  
Got the key to be happy  
Yeah oh yeah yeah oh yeah  
Yeah oh yeah  
  
Baby when you're crying  
I'll love your tears away  
And I will always be trying  
To keep you happy through the years  
As long as we just keep on kissing  
There's nothing in the world  
We won't be missing  
  
[Chorus]  
  
As long as we just keep on kissing  
There's nothing in the world  
We won't be missing  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah (We got a good combination)  
Yeah (We got a good combination)  
Yeah (We got a good combination)  
Yeah (We got a good combination)  
Yeah (We got a good combination)

GOOD TIMES  
Writer Sonny Bono  
  
If you think you got troubles  
I knew a girl named bubbles  
She did a dance she called the paradise  
Ain't that nice  
One night she did her dance  
She had them in a trance  
Till some wise guy brought a safety pin  
Now she wears a grin  
  
[Chorus:]  
Ride on ride on your merry-go-round  
Don't be afraid cause it won't break down  
Dance and sing and raise your glass  
Drink to the good times and hope my friend  
That they last  
  
So if you're feeling blue  
It's really nothing new  
And here's a lesson  
You should take from me  
Because it's free  
Just you remember friend,  
To find that happy end  
To find a pot of gold  
Where rainbows shine  
You got to take the time  
  
[Chorus]

Mama, you gave life to me  
Turned a baby, into a lady  
And mama, all you had to offer  
was a promise of a lifetime of love  
Now I know, there is no other  
Love like a mother's  
Love for her child  
and I know  
a love so complete  
something  
  
Goodbye's the saddest word I'll ever hear  
Goodbye's the last time I will hold you near  
Someday you'll say that word and I will cry  
It'll break my hear to hear you say goodbye  
  
Mama, you gave love to me  
Turned a young one  
Into a woman  
and mama, all I ever needed  
was a guarantee of you loving me  
  
Cuz I know  
there is no other  
love like a mother's  
love for her child  
and it hurts so  
that something so strong  
  
must say goodbye  
  
Goodbye's the saddest word I'll ever hear  
Goodbye's the last time I will hold you near  
Someday you'll say that word and I will cry  
It'll break my heart to hear you say goodbye  
  
Well the love you give  
  
You'll always be there everytime I call  
You ought to be the greatest love of all  
You take my weakness and you make me strong  
And I will always love 'till forever comes

My father married a pure Cherokee  
My mother's people were ashamed of me  
The Indians said I was white by law  
The white man always called me  
"Indian Squaw"  
  
[Chorus]  
Half-breed, that's all I ever heard  
Half-breed, how I learned to hate the word  
Half-breed, she's no good they warned  
Both sides were against me  
Since the day I was born  
  
We never settled, went from town to town  
When you're not welcome you don't hang around  
The other children always laughed at me  
"Give her a feather, she's a Cherokee"  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We weren't accepted and I felt ashamed  
Nineteen I left them, tell me who's to blame  
My life since then has been from man to man  
But I can't run away from what I am  
  
[Chorus]

For the first time, in such a long time  
I've been feelin' there's some reason  
To hold on through the night  
And for the first time since you broke this heart of mine  
I find myself believin'  
It's really gonna be alright  
Now you're askin' me to let you walk back into my life  
Something I can't bring myself to do  
  
'Cause it's been hard enough gettin' over you  
Ya know you kept me holdin' on till the end  
Oh it's been hard enough gettin' over you  
I don't think that I could say goodbye again  
I could trust you, but it's out of my hands  
  
I once believed your promises  
Believed in every word you said  
I still love you but my heart won't take the chance  
That all the pain I've left behind me  
Might be waiting for me up ahead  
Just remember it was you who walked right out of my life  
  
No you don't know what I've been through  
'Cause it's been hard enough gettin' over you  
Ya know you kept me holdin' on till the end  
Oh it's been hard enough gettin' over you  
I don't think that I could say goodbye  
  
I made a promise to myself  
And this one I'm not gonna break  
  
I've made it without you, and I'm not about to  
Just turn around and make the same mistake  
'Cause it's been hard enough gettin' over you  
Ya know you kept me holdin' on till the end  
Oh it's been hard enough gettin' over you  
  
I don't think that I could say goodbye  
I don't think I could say goodbye  
I know that I can't say goodbye again

I think this party is going badly  
Is there something wrong  
I see faces looking sadly  
Have I stayed too long  
  
Even though I see me smile  
That same scene and acting wild  
Pretending that I really care  
Smiling face is just a mask  
  
Without love a kiss is nothing  
Have I done something wrong  
I look around and I can't find nothing  
Have I stayed too long  
  
Without beginning there ain't no end  
Without a hope, you got no friends  
Have I gone from loving you  
To find out what's behind my tears  
  
I got to get out of this place  
I'm tired, tired of waiting  
This phony place  
  
I think this party is going badly  
Is there something wrong  
I see faces looking sadly  
I guess I'm going home  
  
Even though you see me smiling  
That same scene and acting wild  
Pretending that I really care  
Smiling face is just a mask

The road is long,  
With many a winding turn  
That leads us to  
Who knows where, who knows where  
But I'm strong, strong enough to carry him  
He ain't heavy, he's my brother  
  
So on we go,  
His welfare is my concern  
No burden is he to bare,  
We'll get there  
For I know he would not encumber me  
He ain't heavy, he's my brother  
  
If I'm laden at all,  
I'm laden with sadness  
That everyone's heart isn't filled  
With gladness of love for one another  
It's a long long road  
From which there is no return  
While we're on our way to there, why not share  
And the load,  
It doesn't weigh me down at all  
He ain't heavy, he's my brother  
He ain't heavy, he's my brother,  
He's my brother, he's my brother

Beneath the white fire of the moon  
Love's wings are broken all too soon  
We never learn  
Hurt together, hurt alone  
Don't you sometimes  
  
Wish your heart was a heart of stone  
We turn the wheel, and break the chain  
Put steel to steel, and laugh at pain  
We're dreamers in castle's made of sand  
The road to Eden's overgrown  
  
Don't you sometimes  
Wish your heart was a heart of stone  
Look at the headlines  
Big crowd at the crazy house  
Long cue for the joker's shoe  
Ten rounds in the ring with love  
Do you lose and win  
  
Or win and lose  
Sweet rain, like mercy in the night  
(Lay me down, wash away the sorrow)  
Caress my soul and set it right  
(Lay me down, show me your tomorrow)  
Summer tears, winter and the moment's flown  
  
Don't you sometimes  
Wish your heart was a heart of stone  
Mercy, mercy, wish your heart was a heart of stone  
  
Get the picture  
No room for the innocent  
Peak season in lonely town  
Knocked out of the ring by love  
Are you down and up  
  
Or up and down  
I ask the river for a sign  
(In a dream, we go on together)  
How long is love supposed to shine  
(In a dream, diamonds are forever  
But you and I, hurt together, hurt alone  
  
Don't you sometimes  
Wish you heart was a heart of stone  
Mercy, mercy, wish your heart was a heart of stone  
(With a heart of stone, you'll be well protected)  
  
Don't you sometimes  
Wish your heart was made of stone  
(With a heart of stone, you'll be well connected)

They go off and leave me behind  
They have so many words to find  
I run to catch a glimpse of them  
  
Just walking in the sun  
Knowing they'll be mine again  
When the evening has begun  
And when I see them hand in hand  
The boy who walks beside the man  
I pray that I will always have the world  
  
That I have found  
The husband and the son  
That I built my life around  
  
He'll never know of that night long ago  
He'll never know it's locked in my mind  
No he'll never know  
From the feelings I show  
He'll never know  
His son is only mine  
  
Sometimes I lie awake at night  
Watching darkest turn to light  
Thinking back on all the things  
I said to him today  
Wondering if I might had a careless word to say  
When the morning's almost here  
He reaches out to draw me near  
Silently I search his face for the love  
I hope to see and once again  
I'm sure that all his love belongs to me

Here comes that rainy day feeling again  
Writers roger cook, roger greenaway  
  
Here comes that rainy day feeling again  
And soon my tears they will be falling like rain  
It always seems to be a Monday  
Left over memories of Sunday  
Always spent with you before the clouds appear  
And took away my sunshine  
Here comes that rainy day feeling again  
And I'll be dreaming of you baby in vain  
Your face is always on my mind girl  
I hope that soon you're gonna find girl  
Your way back to me  
Cause if you say you'll stay, the rainy days would go away  
Misty morning eyes I'm trying to disguise the way I feel  
But I just can't hide it  
People seem to know  
The loneliness will show  
I'm thinking of my pride but breaking up inside girl... Whoaaa  
Here comes that rainy day feeling again  
And soon my tears they will be falling like rain  
It always seems to be a Monday  
Left over memories of Sunday  
Always spent with you before the clouds appear  
And took away my sunshine  
Here comes that rainy day feeling again  
Here comes that rainy day feeling again  
Here comes that rainy day feeling again  
Here comes that rainy day feeling again

Hey Joe where are you going  
With that gun in your hand  
I said now  
Hey Joe where are you going  
With that gun in your hand  
  
Going down to shoot my old lady  
'Cause you know  
I caught her messing a round town  
I'm going down to shoot my old lady  
'Cause I caught her messing around  
With another man  
  
Hey Joe I heard you shot your woman down  
Shot her down  
Hey I said hey Joe  
I heard you shot your woman down  
Shot her down to the ground  
Yes I did, I shot her  
'Cause I caught her messing around town  
  
Hey Joe I heard you shot your woman down  
Shot her down  
But I said hey Joe  
I heard you shot your woman down  
Shot her down shot her down  
Yes, yes I did, I shot her  
'Cause I caught her messing around town  
  
Hey Joe where you gonna run to now  
I said, I said hey Joe where you gonna run to now  
Where you gonna go  
Well jig I'm going down south way down to Mexico way  
I said I'm going down south way down to Mexico way

Two more days and we'll be home  
Two more days and we won't be alone  
We'll see things that we recognize  
We'll get to look in our baby's eyes  
And I know that you're lonesome baby  
It's hard hanging on  
I know that you're tired baby  
But I'll help you be strong  
Chorus:  
Cause I'm gonna hold you tighter (tighter)  
Tighter (tighter), tighter (tighter)  
(Baby)  
I'm gonna hold you tighter (tighter)  
Tighter (tighter), tighter (tighter)  
(Baby yeah, yeah)  
We've been out on a thirty-day gig  
Paid our dues cause that's how we live  
Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry  
Sometimes we're weary and sometimes we're high  
Hey I know that you're lonesome baby  
It's hard hanging on  
I know that you're tired baby  
But I'll help you be strong  
Chorus  
How'd you tell a baby that's just eight months old  
Her daddy and momma gotta work on the road  
Every night she won't get kissed  
Cause we're out here trying  
To get her all the things that we missed  
And I know that you're lonesome baby  
It's hard hanging on  
I know that you're tired baby  
But I'll help you be strong  
Chorus  
It's seems kinda funny that it ain't just you and me  
The number was two and now we changed to three  
We added one more color and the color made us brighter  
But to keep our rainbow blowing now we gotta be a fighter  
And I know that you're lonesome baby  
It's hard hanging on  
I know that you're tired baby  
But I'll help you be strong  
Chorus

Had my share of disco nights  
Did some talking, rainbow lights  
Easy smile shines like gold  
Burning hot and turning cold  
Live that kind of life before  
Lost the note to learn the score  
Something tells me that  
There must be something more  
  
[Chorus]  
This time I'm holdin' out for love  
Made up my mind  
I'm holdin' out for love  
Mister this time  
I'm holdin' on, holdin' back  
Holdin' out for love  
  
Had my fill of party scenes  
One night stands and neon dreams  
Good times friends and fancy clothes  
Flashing highs and crashing lows  
So if that's what's on your mind  
Well I'll just take a pass this time  
I believe I rather leave it all behind  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I need to find someone  
Who'll still be holding me  
When the dance is done  
  
[Chorus: x 3]

I can see clearly now the rain is gone  
I can see all obstacles in my way  
Gone are the dark clouds that had me blind  
It's gonna be a bright (bright)  
Bright (bright) sunshinin' day  
It's gonna be a bright (bright)  
Bright (bright) sunshinin' day  
  
Oh yes, I can make it now the pain is gone  
All of the bad feelings have disappeared  
Here is the rainbow I've been praying for  
It's gonna be a bright (bright)  
Bright (bright) sunshinin' day (ooh...)  
  
Look all around,  
There's nothing but blue skies  
Look straight ahead,  
There's nothing but blue skies  
  
I can see clearly now the rain is gone  
I can see all obstacles in my way  
Here's the rainbow I've been praying for  
It's gonna be a bright (bright)  
Bright (bright) sunshinin' day  
It's gonna be a bright (bright)  
Bright (bright) sunshinin' day  
Real, real, real, real bright (bright)  
Bright (bright) sunshinin' day  
Yeah, hey, it's gonna be a bright (bright)  
Bright (bright) sunshinin' day

I gave up the fight for love, whoa oh oh  
Walked away to calm for gloves  
No more wishing on a star  
Waiting for someone, whoa  
What if no one ever comes  
  
So I kept my eyes closed, hands up, dancing by myself  
Oh, I never felt nothing better  
Baby how could I know you'd come crashing down from Heaven  
Now my heart is open forever  
  
I don't have to sleep to dream  
I can hardly believe what I see  
When you stand before me  
You're everything I never thought  
That I would ever find  
Now I don't have to sleep to dream  
You're a dream to me  
  
There's a cure for bleeding hearts, whoa  
Think you showed me where to start  
Every time I lose my grip  
You keep me hangin' on, whoa oh oh  
You remind that I'm strong  
  
So I kept my eyes closed, hands up, dancing by myself  
Oh, I never felt nothing better  
Baby how could I know you'd come crashing down from Heaven  
Now my heart is open forever  
  
I don't have to sleep to dream  
I can hardly believe what I see  
When you stand before me  
You're everything I never thought  
That I would ever find  
Now I don't have to sleep to dream  
You're a dream  
  
I don't have to sleep to dream  
I can hardly believe what I see  
When you stand before me  
You're everything I never thought  
That I would ever find  
Now I don't have to sleep to dream  
You're a dream to me  
  
You're a dream  
  
I don't have to sleep to dream  
I can hardly believe what I see  
When you stand before me  
You're everything I never thought  
That I would ever find  
Now I don't have to sleep to dream  
You're a dream, dream  
You're a dream to me

When I look up from my pillow  
I dream you are there with me  
Though you are far away  
I know you always be near to me  
  
[Chorus]  
I go to sleep, sleep  
And imagine that you're there with me  
I go to sleep, sleep  
And imagine that you're there with me  
  
I look around me and feel  
That you are ever so close to me  
Those tears that fall from my eyes  
Bring back memories of you and me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I was wrong, I was right  
I will love you till the day I die  
You alone, you alone and no one else  
You were meant for me  
  
When morning comes once more  
I have the loneliness you left me  
Each day drags by until night  
Finally descends on me  
  
[Chorus]

They say we're young and we don't know  
We won't find out until we grow  
Well I don't know if all that's true  
'Cause you got me, and baby I got you  
  
Babe  
I got you babe  
I got you babe  
  
They say our love won't pay the rent  
Before it's earned, our money's all been spent  
I guess that's so, we don't have a plot  
But at least I'm sure of all the things we got  
  
Babe  
I got you babe  
I got you babe  
  
I got flowers in the spring  
I got you to wear my ring  
And when I'm sad, you're a clown  
And if I get scared, you're always around  
  
Don't let them say your hair's too long  
'Cause I don't care, with you I can't go wrong  
Then put your little hand in mine  
There ain't no hill or mountain we can't climb  
  
Babe  
I got you babe  
I got you babe  
  
I got you to hold my hand  
I got you to understand  
I got you to walk with me  
I got you to talk with me  
I got you to kiss goodnight  
I got you to hold me tight  
I got you, I won't let go  
I got you to love me so  
  
I got you babe  
I got you babe  
I got you babe  
I got you babe  
I got you babe  
I got you babe  
I got you babe  
I got you babe

You were the only thing I had  
How could a good love go so bad  
Somehow I guess I should have known  
That you would leave me here alone  
  
They say you found somebody new  
But that won't change my love for you  
How could you leave me on my own  
You know I hate to sleep alone  
  
Remember how it used to be  
When you were here with me  
You were the only one I've known  
And how I hate to sleep alone  
  
Someday, some way, somebody new  
Will make you feel the way that I do  
But I just wish that you'd come home  
You know that I hate to sleep alone  
  
But I just wish that you'd come home  
You know that I hate to sleep alone

These clouds aren't going nowhere, darling  
Rain keeps coming down  
I just thought I'd try to call you  
For you got too far outta town  
And I hope that you get this message that I'm leaving for you  
'Cause I'd hate that you left without hearing the words that I needed you to  
  
And I hope you find it  
What you're looking for  
I hope it's everything you dreamed your life could be  
And so much more  
  
And I hope you're happy, wherever you are  
I wanted you to know that  
And nothing's gonna change that  
I hope you find it  
  
Am I supposed to hang around and wait forever?  
Last words that I said  
But that was nothing but a broken heart talking, darling  
You know it wasn't what I meant  
Call me up, let me know that you got this message that I'm leaving for you  
'Cause I'd hate that you left without hearing the words that I needed you to  
  
And I hope you find it  
What you're looking for  
I hope it's everything you dreamed your life could be  
And so much more  
  
And I hope you're happy, wherever you are  
I wanted you to know that  
And nothing's gonna change that  
I hope you find it  
  
Whatever it is out there that you were missing here  
  
Well, I hope you find it  
What you're looking for  
I hope it's everything you dreamed your life could be  
And so much more  
  
And I hope you're happy wherever you are  
I wanted you to know that  
And nothing's gonna change that  
I hope you find it  
I hope you find it  
Oh, oh

I know you don't love me no more  
No more ah no more  
I don't wanna be hurt any anymore no no more  
Ain't no use in me cryin now  
Everything I did, you put me down  
I don't want you no more baby  
Ain't no use in you hangin round  
  
I know you don't want me no more  
No more ah no more  
And with someone else  
Lovin you more, lovin you more  
Ain't no use in me cryin now  
If weren't for you I won't be down  
Cause you don't want me no more baby  
Ain't no use in you hangin round  
  
I know you don't love me no more  
No more no no more  
I don't wanna be hurt any anymore anymore  
I have loved so hard everything I did was no joy  
Since I can't love you right baby  
I don't have to love you at all  
  
I know you don't love me no more  
No more ah no more  
I don't wanna be hurt any anymore anymore  
I have loved so hard everything I did was no joy

I love making love to you  
Duet by cher and greg allman  
  
Aw, feels so fine every time  
Ooh, I love making love to you  
Anywhere I don't care  
Oh, I love making love to you  
  
Oh, the fire in your eyes  
Makes my loving temperature rise  
And honey sweet ecstasy  
Ooh, I love what you're doing to me  
Please don't stop  
Oh, I think I'm gonna lose control  
Honey don't stop  
I want you to fill me with your soul  
  
[Chorus:]  
Cause there's no lightning and thunder  
Any seven wonder mightier  
Than what you've got  
Keep it up forever  
No one does it better, baby  
Come and get it while it's hot  
  
Oh, give me more like before  
I love making love to you  
Makes me feel life is real  
Ooh, I love making love to you  
Oh, your heart touching mine  
Starts the beat of unnatural rhyme  
Such a sweet melody  
Oh I love what you've given to me  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Give me more like before  
Ooh, I love making love to you  
Makes me feel life is real  
Ooh, I love making love to you  
  
[Chorus x3]  
[Fade]

Don't makes no difference  
If you lay down and cry  
You know that you lied to me  
And if you come to me  
With tears in your eyes  
Don't say good-bye  
Just leave  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause I'm in the middle of something  
I don't understand  
How can my reasons for living  
Slip right through my hands  
I'm in the middle of something  
I don't understand  
And if looks like I lose again  
  
Don't make no difference  
What you think of me  
You know that I'm restless and afraid  
And if you love me  
I know that you will see  
You can't keep me  
To the promises that I made  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Don't make no difference  
What you think about me  
After all you took me for a ride  
Now every night with you  
I still seem to find  
I just can't keep you satisfied  
  
[Chorus: x2]

In for the night  
With greg allman  
  
Snuggle with me mama like you used to  
Weather's kind of cold, but I don't care  
Slip off your old red flannel nightgown  
Getting to feel like fall  
Hey we're a fallen pair  
  
[Chorus:]  
Well there's a bluebird  
Flying home to Mobile  
Camping in your cornfield for a while  
Seems he just backed into a square meal  
And he's in for the night  
  
See that fine yellow moon a rising  
Through the frost along the window pane  
All of your shooting stars  
Are in the wrong direction  
Well I love you darling  
But you just seem to change  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Strut with me mama like you used to  
Weather's kind of cold, but I don't care  
Slip off your old red flannel nightgown  
Getting to feel like falling with a fallin' fare  
  
[Chorus:]

The way you look at her  
Is the way you use to look at me  
When things were different  
Too many changes have gone down  
Strange vibrations all around  
Makes me think perhaps  
Our love ain't right  
So ask your heart and soul  
They will surely know  
If you still love me  
No break down is too big  
For you not to dig  
The kind of love I'm putting down  
It all adds up now  
Two and two are really four  
It all adds up now  
My heart knows the score  
Put me in your loving bag  
Please don't say I am a drag  
I gave you more than life itself  
So if you can walk away  
Love will come another day  
In a new disguise  
Maybe you're the kind of guy  
All you want to do is make me cry  
Sometimes I wonder why today  
It all adds up now  
Two and two are really four  
It all adds up now  
My heart knows the score  

It gets me where I want to go  
  
It gets me where I wanna go  
A ride around the world  
Just around the corner  
In his eyes  
It gets me where I wanna go  
A vision of my day dreams  
About what the good life means  
In my eyes  
Too many sad eyes are open for me now  
Too many dreams of life  
Dissolved and into dust  
Too many moments lost  
The price ain't worth the cost  
Too many wasted thoughts of loving  
And leaving you  
Taste of life, I have with you  
It gets me where I wanna go  
A ride around the world  
Just around the corner  
In his eyes  
In his eyes  
In his eyes

Here it is again Monday morning  
And I really got the blues  
But it don't much matter  
I got no need to smile  
And I don't think I will for quit awhile  
  
CHORUS:  
So it might as well stay Monday from now on  
Cause it seems that the only one I ever love is gone  
And it just might as well stay Monday from now on  
  
Go away mister sun I can't use you  
Brighten someone else's life  
Let the darkest hide me and carry off my pain  
For there's nothing you can do, nothing you can do,  
Nothing you can do to make things change  
  
Chorus  
  
Let the darkest hide me and carry off my pain  
For there's nothing you can do, nothing you can do,  
Nothing you can do to make things change  
And it might as well stay Monday from now on  
Might as well stay Monday from now on

This is a man's world  
This is a man's world  
But it would be nothing  
Nothing without a woman or a girl  
  
You see man made the cars  
To take us over the road  
Man made the train  
To carry the heavy load  
  
Man made the electric lights  
To take us out of the dark  
Man made the boat for the water  
Like Noah made the ark  
  
This is a man's man's man's world  
But it would be nothing  
Nothing without a woman or a girl  
  
Man thinks of little baby girls  
And the baby boys  
Man make them happy  
'Cause man makes them toys  
  
And after man make everything  
Everything he can  
You know that man makes money  
To buy from other man  
  
This is a man's world  
But it would be nothing, nothing  
Not one little thing  
Without a woman or a girl  
  
He's lost in the wilderness  
He's lost in the bitterness  
He's lost, lost and

IT'S GONNA RAIN  
Writer Sonny Bono  
  
  
It's gonna rain outside  
I can tell by the clouds  
In the sky whoa, whoa  
Uh-uh oh uh-uh  
You used to come  
And see me baby all the time  
People see you walking down the street  
They say you were mine  
We use to love each other baby  
Ah that's all  
Well I can still remember  
Your skin so soft  
It's gonna rain outside  
I can tell by the clouds  
In the sky whoa, whoa  
Uh-uh oh uh-uh  
You would come and see me  
Baby gave you all I had to give  
Sometimes when you left me  
I didn't know if I was gonna live  
Used to watch the suns come up  
And the moons go down  
We used to take off our shoes  
And stamp our feet in the ground  
Oh yeah

You're not the kind of guy  
That make the girls all sigh  
And they never turn their heads  
And look when you walk by  
  
But baby that's okay I love you anyway  
And I never change or rearrange you  
So stay that way  
  
Cause it's the little things that mean a lot  
It's what you are not what you got  
Call my name and I'll come running  
Look at me and the clouds start sunning  
Hold my hand and you got me going  
Kiss my lips and my mind starts going  
We got a thing that won't stop cooking  
You turn me on just by looking  
You can make me strong just by sighing  
You can break my heart just by crying  
  
You're not the smartest man that I ever met  
And every word you ever said I won't forget  
And so I guess that's why until the day I die  
When you're bad and make me sad  
You're still my guy

It's too late to say you want me  
But it's too late  
Once my love for you was so great  
It's too late to love me now  
It's too bad, you say you need me  
Ah it's too bad  
And I know the feeling and it's so sad  
It's too late to love me now  
It's too late to love me now  
Don'tcha you know how hard I've tried  
Hold out just for you  
Loving you from memory day by day  
Someone came into my life  
And turned my dreams around  
Well he's taking all the love you turned away  
It's too late to say you want me  
But it's too late  
Once my love for you was so great  
It's too late to love me now  
Don'tcha you know how hard I've tried  
Hold out just for you  
Loving you from memory day by day  
Someone came into my life  
And turned my dreams around  
He's taking all the love you turned away  
It's too bad, you say you need me  
And it's too bad  
And I know the feeling and it's so sad  
It's too late to love me now  
It's too late to love me now  

She lives life with hungry ears  
Well that's like Julie borned in the air  
Riding away on the horses that run through my life  
You think I'm fun just watching the game  
But Julie you're messing with a naked flame  
I'm a dangerous rain that wash all your lies away  
  
Well I never, Julie you're the shape of sin  
But I can strut boy, when the line dance begins  
So cool it Julie or I'm gonna do you in  
  
Julie, Julie why do you taunt me  
Julie, Julie you're lying  
Julie, Julie Why do you haunt me  
Julie, oh Julie you lying bitch  
  
Well you think I'm just flying  
With strings of a kite  
But Julie I hope you're not for oblige  
I'm flying higher  
And I am the one holding the knife  
He's all that I got and he's all that I want  
Well Julie for the last time enough is enough  
Take it from me you'll meet no meaner woman, no  
  
Julie, Julie why do you taunt me  
Julie, Julie you're lying  
Julie, Julie Why do you haunt me  
Julie, oh Julie you lying bitch  
  
Julie, Julie why do you taunt me  
Julie, Julie you're lying  
Julie, Julie Why do you haunt me  
Julie, oh Julie you lying bitch

Just A name  
Writer Sonny Bono  
  
It's just a name, it's just a name  
It's not too long and it's kinda plain  
He's just a guy, just a little guy  
And he's not too brave, not too shy  
And he'll never make me stay  
And he's not very much of a mystery  
He's not even handsome, nor is he tall  
But there's no way I could live at all  
Without his funny name  
  
He's just a guy, just a little guy  
That can make me laugh  
That can make me cry  
Did I mention this before  
He's got all I want and even more  
But he gives me all that he has to give  
And I guess that's why I just couldn't live  
Without his funny name  
  
She's just a girl, she's just a girl  
Her hair is straight she don't have a curl  
She's not so hot, I mean what's she got  
She's got all that I want and even more  
She's the girl I love, that I adore  
Cause she gives me all that she has to give  
And I guess that's why I just couldn't live  
Without her funny name  
  
Just a name  
It's just a name  
It's just a name  
It's just a name

It's true, you got me wrapped around your finger  
Ah honey, it seems that's where I belong  
You know how to hold me, thrill me and control me  
Just enough, just enough to keep me hangin' on  
Ah honey, just enough, just enough to keep me hangin' on  
  
My heart is like a yo-yo string  
I'm tied to you, I'm tied to you right or wrong  
My love keeps on growing  
Cause your love keeps right on showing  
Just enough, just enough to keep me hangin' on  
Oh baby, just enough, just enough to keep me hangin' on  
  
A love as true as mine will make you do most anything  
Like hiding tears and heartaches  
And dreaming all those silly dreams  
Ah honey, you got me, you got me where you want me  
And you keep me stringing along  
  
Just enough, just enough to keep me hangin' on  
Ah baby, just enough, just enough to keep me hangin' on  
Ah honey, just enough, just enough to keep me hangin' on  
Oh tell me why, just enough

With his big brown eyes he came my way  
I didn't know then what he had to say  
I could tell that he felt bad  
By the way he looked that he felt sad, oh yeah  
  
Sometimes you hurt me baby, I don't know why  
I'll always love you baby till the day I die  
But when you look at fellas  
Baby I get jealous  
I only live my life for you  
Anything you say I'll do  
I'll live for you, I'll die for you  
I'll even climb the mountains high for you  
  
Thought right then he'd break my heart  
I could feel the teardrops start  
Why didn't he know I love him so  
I could never let him go, oh no  
  
I'd never hurt you baby, tell you why  
I'm gonna love you till the day I die  
When I look at fellas  
Baby don't get jealous  
I only live my life for you, anything you say I'll do  
I'll live for you, I'll die for you  
I'll even climb the mountains high for you  
  
I love you, just you, nobody else but you  
I love you, only you,every day, every day, just you

Do nothing 'til you hear from me  
Leave a number where you're gonna be  
These times are dangerous for you and me  
But I'll get a message through  
  
He'll be watching every move you make  
He'll be waiting for that one mistake  
Somebody's heart is gonna have to break  
Before we're through  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause we can't live from kiss to kiss  
Making up for all we miss  
Hiding in the daylight shadows  
Until it's time to say goodbye  
Wishing it could be alright  
Living with the loneliness  
From kiss to kiss  
  
Don't ask me now what's right or wrong  
I've been wondering since you came along  
We we're weak and love was strong  
Now there's nothing we can do  
  
So I'll meet you at the same old place  
I know it's worth it when I see you face  
Someday we'll disappear without a trace  
Baby that's the truth  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I keep hoping we'll find a way  
I keep wondering, who's gonna pay  
I keep waiting for judgment day  
Some people's lives just get in the way  
That's the truth  
  
[Chorus]

I don't want to lose this good thing  
Baby that we got  
If I do, I would surely, surely lose alot  
Cause your love is better  
Then any love I know  
It's like thunder (Thunder)  
And lightning (Lightning)  
The way you love me is freighting  
I better knock on wood (Baby)  
I better knock, knock, knock  
  
I'm not superstitious about you  
I can't take no chance  
Got me spinning oh baby  
Baby I'm in a trance  
Cause your love is better  
Then any love I know  
It's like thunder (Thunder)  
And lightning (Lightning)  
The way you love me is freighting  
I better knock on wood  
  
It's no screte that my man fills my loving cup  
He sees to it that I get just enough  
Just one touch from him  
Lord it means so much  
It's like thunder (Thunder)  
And lightning (Lightning)  
The way you love me is freighting  
I better knock on wood  
  
Knock, knock, knock on wood  
I think I better  
Knock, (Knock) knock on wood  
I think I better  
Knock, (Knock) knock on wood  
I think I better  
Knock, (Knock) knock on wood  
I think I better  
Knock, (Knock) knock on wood  
I think I better  
Knock, (Knock) knock on wood  
I think I better  
Knock, (Knock) knock on wood

Seven thousand miles to Paris  
Nine hundred miles to Rome  
And I'm goin' every mile to find  
My piece of mind at home  
This infatuatio is driving me insane  
To make my reservation  
On the next L.A. plane  
Make me high, make me sane  
Get me aboard that L.A. plane  
I'm tired of the pouring rain  
Get me safe, get me warm  
Get me a Southern California morning  
Where I was born, boy I'm coming  
I'm coming home to you  
He look so fine in Europe  
On all the posters and the brochures  
I thought they promised something more  
Than what was mine and yours  
Well I was looking for excitement  
On every boat and train  
But all I saw were unfamiliar faces in the rain  
Get me high, get me sane  
Get me aboard that L.A. plane  
I'm tired of this pouring rain  
I'm tired of just passing through  
Get me safe, get me warm  
Get me a Southern California morning  
Where I was born, babe I'm coming  
I'm coming home to you  
And now nothing look better in my mind  
Than your warm and loving face  
And all these miles have taught me  
That your loved can't be replaced  
Get me high, get me sane  
Get me aboard that L.A. plane  
I'm tired of this pouring rain  
I'm tired of just passing through  
Get me safe, get me warm  
Get me a Southern California morning  
Where I was born, babe I'm coming  
I'm coming home to you

Isn't it nasty, isn't it sad  
Gonna make you wonder  
Gonna make you mad  
Same ol' heartache your best friend  
Has come to visit once again  
Your mistake was in the beginning  
When you thought that he would last  
When you weren't looking  
No you weren't listen  
And once he left you broke like glass  
Let this be a lesson to you  
Take this message to your heart  
Love is gonna slip right through you  
You got to watch it from the start  
Thought you had yourself a true love  
Thought he was in love with you  
But he was just like a devil  
Took your heart and broke it to  
Well there's no telling who's on the level  
And there's no way to know what's real  
Just remember how it all happened  
And be sure that you know who's got the deal  
Let this be a lesson to you  
Take this message to your heart  
Love is gonna slip right through you  
You got to watch it from the start  
Let this be a lesson to you  
Take this message to your heart  
Love is gonna slip right through you  
You got to watch it from the start  
Let this be a lesson to you  
Take this message to your heart  
Love is gonna slip right through you  
You got to watch it from the start  
Let this be a lesson to you  
Take this message to your heart  
Love is gonna slip right through you  
You got to watch it from the start  
Let this be a lesson to you  
Take this message to your heart  
Love is gonna slip right through you  
You got to watch it from the start  

Hmmm  
  
Oh, fuck, just lie to me  
Tell me something sweet  
Till I look the other way  
Don't wanna start over babe  
Already gave you everything  
I got nothing left of me  
The truth is overrated  
  
Here it comes now, you're gonna stab me in the heart  
I'm gonna hold my ears, so I can't hear us fall apart  
Oh, I'm just a little broken down, trying to keep myself alive  
So don't kill me  
Don't kill me  
  
Neither one of us is pure enough to come clean  
  
I'd rather you lie to me  
And look me dead in the eyes  
Tell me I'm the one you need  
I don't wanna start over babe  
This was my everything  
You were my last chance, you see  
Truth is overrated to me  
  
Is this all common now?  
Where's that fairytale that sold us out?  
Oh, do you really think you're the only one with secrets now?  
See, you're like me  
You're just like me  
  
Well, one of us is happy  
Other bleeds  
  
So just lie to me  
I tell you something sweet  
Till we look the other way  
We don't wanna start over babe  
Weavin' up everything  
Till there's nothing left  
  
Hmmm

Once upon a time you dressed so fine  
Threw the bums a dime  
In your prime, didn't you?  
People'd call, say "Beware doll  
You're bound to fall"  
You thought they were all kiddin' you  
You used to laugh about  
Everybody that was hangin' out  
Now you don't talk so loud  
Now you don't seem so proud  
About having to be scrounging  
For your next meal  
  
How does it feel, How does it feel  
To be without a home,  
With no direction known,  
Like a complete unknown,  
Like a rolling stone?  
  
You've gone to the finest school  
All right, Miss Lonely  
But you know you only used  
To get juiced in it  
And nobody has ever taught you  
How to live on the street  
And now you find out  
You're gonna have to get used to it  
You said you'd never compromise  
With the mystery tramp  
But now you realize  
He's not selling any alibis  
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes  
And ask him do you want to make a deal?  
  
How does it feel, How does it feel  
To be without a home,  
Like a complete unknown,  
With no direction home  
Like a complete unknown,  
Like a rolling stone?  
  
You never turned around to see  
The frowns on the jugglers and the clowns  
When they all come down  
And did tricks for you  
You never understood that it ain't no good  
You shouldn't let other people  
Get your kicks for you  
You used to ride on the chrome horse  
With your diplomat  
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat  
Ain't it hard when you discover that  
He really wasn't where it's at  
After he took from you everything  
He could steal  
  
How does it feel, How does it feel  
To be without a direction known,  
Without a home  
Like a complete unknown,  
Like a rolling stone?

Little man, when you stand by my side  
Then I know I don't have to hide from anyone  
And I pray that we'll stay just that way  
Till the day comes along when we catch the sun.  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Little girl you're runnin'  
Come catch my hand I'm near you  
Little girl you're singin'  
Come close to me I hear you  
You're growin' old, my mother's cold  
Now you've learned what it meant to be mature  
There's no such place as make believe  
But when I look at your face,  
I'm not so sure  
  
You and me is what I see  
And that's the way its gonna stay and it will always be  
So little man, please understand  
In this world with all its land  
You're all I see  
  
[Chorus: x2]

Look at us the picture of happiness  
Not so long ago, Ah, not so very long ago  
The pride of all our friends  
The perfect couple were we  
Is this how it will end?  
Just a sad sad story.  
  
[Chorus]  
Living in a house divided  
With a love that's so one-sided  
There's no chance at all  
The walls have got to fall  
Tumbling down  
  
Look at us the King and Queen of emptiness  
Living inside our castle of loneliness  
Unable to make amends  
Such perfect strangers are we  
Is this how it will end?  
Just a sad story.  
  
[Chorus]

Long distance love affair  
Writer klaus meine  
  
The only king of rock has gone  
Gone to heaven  
A star on the way to the stars  
Another king of rock is born in '77  
Just born to be there when it's dark  
'94, '95, if the world is still alive  
With the start of the riot of your time  
Here's a ticket for a burning train  
To set the world in flame  
To play the hero's game  
The riot of your time  
Here's a ticket for the future days  
You'll be the guitar king  
When your electric plays  
The riot of your time  
A new generation's mind  
The riot of your time  
Just to get the message to be more  
Than you desire  
A star full of life wild and young  
The hits from 1994 electric fire  
Will burn out the time like the sun  
'94, '95, if the world is still alive  
With the start of the riot of your time  
Here's a ticket for a burning train  
To set the world in flame  
To play the hero's game  
The riot of your time  
Here's a ticket for the future days  
You'll be the guitar king  
When your electric plays  
The riot of your time  
A new generation's mind  
The riot of your time

Look at me  
Tell me what do you see  
Does my soul lay broken inside  
Look at me  
Tell me what do you see  
Have my tears washed away  
My foolish pride  
  
The nights are so long  
The days come on strong  
Look at me  
Tell me what do you see  
The pain I have borne  
My body's so worn  
Look at me  
Tell me what do you see  
  
The nights are so long  
The days come on strong  
Look at me  
Tell me what do you see  
The pain I have borne  
My body's so worn  
Look at me  
Tell me what do you see

I see the clouds and I feel the rain  
It's all coming down to you again  
And I take the ashes  
Though memories stays the same  
It's all coming down to love and pain  
  
Headin' for the coast  
Trying to make the most of this misery  
Cause there's a pain in my heart  
And it's tearing me apart  
Well I guess it all comes down to loving you  
(Do you see the clouds, can you feel the rain)  
It's all coming down to love and pain  
  
On the road again (thinking about you baby)  
Tomorrow I will play L. A.  
But there's a pain in my heart  
And it's tearing me apart  
Well I guess that's just the ay my story goes  
  
Well there's a hunger in my veins  
And it's driving me insane  
But I guess it all comes down to love and pain  
  
Well there's a hunger in my veins  
And it's driving me insane  
So won't you help me, so won't you help me  
Ah won'tcha help me, help me, help me, help me  
  
But there's a hunger in my heart  
And it's tearing me apart  
Well I guess that's just the way my story goes  
And there's a hunger in my veins  
And it's driving me insane  
Well I guess it all comes down to loving you  
Oh I guess it's all coming down to love and pain

Here, here in this world  
Where do we go  
Where can we turn  
When we need some love  
It seems that love just can't be found  
Where, where do we stand  
When love's supply don't meet love's demands  
  
We got enough stars to light the sky at night  
Enough sun to make the whole world bright  
We got more than enough  
But there's one thing there's just not enough of  
  
[Chorus]  
Not enough love and understanding  
We could use some love to ease these troubled times  
Not enough love and understanding why, oh wh-why-why  
  
Spend all of our time  
Building buildings up to the sky  
Reaching everywhere but where we need to reach the most  
Hearts never can win  
Oh, in this race  
This race that we're in  
  
We've got enough cars to drive around the world  
Enough planes to take us anywhere  
We got more than enough  
But there's one thing there's just not enough of  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]  
  
We need some understandin'  
We need a little more love  
Some love and understandin'  
Enough stars to light the sky at night  
Enough sun to make the whole world bright  
Enough hearts to find some love inside  
We got more than enough  
But there's one thing there's just not enough of  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x5]

Something goes wrong,Something goes right,  
And it ever punishes or strokes our pride.  
Never stop to think how much we lose,  
When we pick and chose in out solitude.  
  
Sothing comes up, Something goes down,  
Suddenly you feel your being pushed around,  
And just becuse you think your losin hold,  
You try to take control, the stories very old.  
  
But if we ever get our minds made up  
All we gotta do is love enough,  
Won't be long before it comes to you  
Given love enough, you'll see it through  
All you gotta do is love enough  
  
Someone wants in, someone wants out  
But doesnt't't't anybody see beyond the clouds,  
Cause man you've hardly learned to speak your name  
Before your in this game  
But baby all the same  
  
But if we ever get our minds made up  
All we gotta do is love enough,  
Won't be long before it comes to you  
Given love enough, you'll pull it through  
All you gotta do is love enough  
  
All you really gotta do is love enough  
Wont be long before it comes to you  
Given love enough, you'll see it through  
All you gotta do is love enough

Love is a lonely place without you, without you, without you  
I know I'm not alone  
I should not be afraid  
'Cause I hear your voice  
And I know you're there beside me  
And so I give my heart  
I live to love again  
But I can't let go  
Of the way I feel about you  
Love is a lonely place without you  
I miss you and you're almost here  
And I'm almost touching you  
Love is a place I have to hide away  
I'll never love this way again, again  
If love was ever true  
I know it was with you  
'Cause you touch my soul  
And you stay with me forever  
No tears, no sad goodbyes  
There are no reasons why  
But I'm holding on  
I believe in love eternal  
Love is a lonely place without you  
I miss you and you're almost here  
And I'm almost touching you  
Love is a place I have to hide away  
I'll never love this way again  
Though I'm moving on  
I'm still holding on, holding on, holding on  
Love is a lonely place without you  
I miss you and you're almost here  
And I'm almost touching you  
Love is a place I have to hide away  
I'll never love this way again, again  
Love is a lonely place, a lonely place  
Love is a lonely place, a lonely place  
Love is a lonely place, a lonely place  
...  

In the east and in the west  
Every bird will seek its' nest  
Everyone will seek its' home  
Home is where the heart goes  
  
And the moon will rise and fall  
And the light will touch the tide  
Are we holding hands and never feeling?  
  
All around the world we sing  
Like a penny in a spin  
Always looking for the way  
To get out, to get in  
  
[Chorus]  
Love is the groove in which we move  
Love is the groove in which we move  
Love is the groove in which we move  
  
In the alleys o Monsay  
In the streets of Katmandu  
On the high roads of Peru  
People meet and touch and go  
  
But the wind of change will blow  
And another dance will start  
And I'll finally get the point  
Like an arrow to my heart  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Look back where's the sea  
Who brought this mystery?  
Deep in another world  
Someone is listening  
  
And they as with night  
And we keep asking why  
Look back there's the key  
Deep in another life  
  
On this ship in which we sail  
Everything is possible  
Keep on turning like a star  
Till you get to where you are  
  
If I promise not to laugh  
Will you promise not to cry?  
Will you promise not to let this life  
Slip by?

We use to talk  
Delivered on a dime  
Now we live together  
Never find the time  
We use to walk  
As lovers on the sand  
Now we're working full time  
On our lifetime plan  
We never stop to see  
The moon at night  
We're just too busy  
Leading complicated lives  
  
Whoa, whoa, whoa  
I remember love on a rooftop  
We couldn't make our love stop  
We were giving all that we got  
Whoa, whoa, whoa  
I remember holding you so tight  
Ooh, when kissing lasted all night  
Whoa, whoa, whoa,  
Love on a rooftop  
Whoa, whoa, whoa,  
  
Look at us now all grown up  
We got it all together  
Got it all sown up  
But is this all, it was leading to  
Do we just run out of dreams  
When all our dreams come true  
What ever happened  
To those endless nights  
When we were happy  
Living young and foolish lives  
  
Whoa, whoa, whoa  
I remember love on a rooftop  
We couldn't make our love stop  
We were giving all that we got  
Whoa, whoa, whoa  
I remember holding you so tight  
Ooh, when kissing lasted all night  
Whoa, whoa, whoa,  
Love on a rooftop  
Whoa, whoa, whoa,  
  
We never stop to see  
The moon at night  
We're just too busy  
Leading complicated lives  
  
Whoa, whoa, whoa  
I remember love on a rooftop  
We couldn't make our love stop  
We were giving all that we got  
Whoa, whoa, whoa  
I remember holding you so tight  
Ooh, when kissing lasted all night  
Whoa, whoa, whoa,  
Love on a rooftop  
Whoa, whoa, whoa,

Put a lid on it  
What's that you say?  
Put a lid on it  
Oh man, no way  
Put a lid down on it, and everything will be all right.  
Put a lid on it  
Don't hand me that  
Put a lid on it  
I'm all right, Jack  
Put a lid down on it, before somebody starts a fight.  
  
Say, every time I turn it loose you cats Come down and cook my goose  
When I start I just can't stop  
But if you keep this up you're gonna blow your top!  
Put a lid on it  
Too late this time  
Put a lid on it  
I've got to get what's mine  
Put a lid down on it, and everything will be all right.  
  
Well, grab your drink and clear a space I think it's time to torch  
This place  
Now the girl's in overdrive  
But some of your pals want to stay alive!  
I'll put a lid on it  
I'll put a lid down on it  
Save it for another night

(Somthing's In The Air)  
I feel something in the air  
Something that was never there  
I feel something started to live in me  
Something only God could give to me  
Could give to me  
  
Chorus:  
I feel magic every where  
Even though I'm supposed to care  
About all the things that my neighbors  
Will think of me and how I should act  
When they said what a nice girl  
I used to be, I used to be  
  
My mom will say my god what've you done  
I told you that boy was only a fun  
My daddy will raise like a storm on the sea  
Say now look what you've done to me  
Even though I care, I feel magic in the air  
  
What's a matter with you baby  
Did you fall too hard when you fall in love  
You fall in love  
What's a matter with you baby  
Did you fall too hard  
  
Chorus

You're my main man  
When you call my heart goes sailin'  
My feet refuse to touch the ground  
When you come around  
You're my main man  
That's what the neighborhood's been sayin'  
Even Mother knows your name  
I'll take your love and never be the same  
  
Oh, you're my main man  
I am your only woman  
Oh, you're my main man  
Forever  
  
You're my main man  
Paid the gypsy to keep prayin'  
I'll keep a candle lit for love  
And watch the street  
For you from up above  
  
Oh, you're my main man  
I am your only woman  
Oh, you're my main man  
Forever  
  
You're my main man  
When you call my heart goes sailin''  
I'll keep a candle lit for love  
And watch the street  
For you from up above  
  
Oh, you're my main man  
I am your only woman  
Oh, you're my main man  
Forever  

Lord I haven't ask for anything  
In such a long, long time  
Not since that brand new party dress  
When I was eight or nine  
And I know the world's in such a stench  
You got a lot to do  
But if you ever find yourself  
With a minute or two  
Won'tcha please  
  
[Chorus]  
Make the man love me  
Ah make the man see  
I'd be so good for him  
If he'd start letting me  
Come on now  
Make the man love me  
Ah make the man care  
Just open up his heart, Lord  
And I'll take it from there  
  
Lord I know that he needs me  
It's just he don't know  
And my heart so full of him  
It's gonna overflow  
And so if you should have a miracle  
You want to do up right  
Ah won'tcha take him by the hand  
And show him the light  
Won'tcha you please  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh I want him  
Lord how I want him  
To make some love to me  
Won'tcha make him see  
How sweet it could be  
So come on come on now  
  
[Chorus]

Mama look sharp  
  
Momma, hey momma  
Come looking for me  
I'm here in the meadow  
By the red maple tree  
Momma, hey momma  
Look sharp  
Here I be  
Hey, hey momma, look sharp  
Them soldiers they fired  
Oh ma did we run  
But when we turned around  
The battle begun  
Then I went under  
Oh ma, am I done  
Hey, hey momma, look sharp  
My eyes are wide open  
My face to the sky  
Is that you, I'm hearing  
In the tall grass near by  
Ah momma come find me  
Before I do die  
Hey, hey momma, look sharp  
I'll close your eyes, my Billy  
Those eyes that can not see  
And I'll bury you, my Billy  
Beneath the maple tree  
And never again  
Will you whisper to me  
Hey, hey, oh momma, look sharp

Mama was a rock and roll singer yeah  
Papa used to write all her songs  
Well you could hear their music playing  
On the jukebox all day long  
  
Whoa They was bringing down together yes they is  
In a 2-Part harmony,  
Till one day, one day my daddy sang alone  
He sang his song just for me  
Good God  
  
You think you're just a fox  
And that's all that you got to be  
Oh well you might be a fox  
But lady that ain't enough for me  
You're jacking everybody in town  
But you ain't jacking me around  
  
[Chorus:]  
Foxy lady shining on  
I hope you miss me when I'm gone  
Coz foxy lady gone is where I'm gonna be  
  
You're super fine  
And you blow people's mind I know  
But will you pardon me please  
If I don't stick around for your show  
You got everybody chasing your tail  
They even let you put them in jail  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Oh damn you girl  
You went and messed up  
The world we had  
And what I'm trying to say  
In my own sweet way if I may  
You got everybody singing your tune  
But you're flying on a friendly balloon  
  
[Chorus:]

Melody you're my oldest friend  
I can talk to you  
What a day it's been out there  
In the madden crush  
Another day's gone dying in the dust  
  
Melody, listen for the phone  
While I change my clothes  
He knows by now I'm home  
Three days waiting took its toil  
This trying to type and crying  
It's getting old  
  
Melody, remember long summer days  
Playing grown ups in the city  
Mama saying sweet dreams sleepy heads  
Tuck in bed with you, my favorite dolly  
  
Oh Melody, with your raggedy charms  
I have looked for love in a stranger's arms  
Scared of going home, for what they'll see  
You know mama eyes could  
Always look right through  
And daddy, he wouldn't be so proud of me  
No, they won't understand like you, Melody

I get up this morning, forget about all my plans  
Think about my vacations with my latest man  
Everything I did, what I should've done  
Why I didn't stay why I didn't run  
Only I hold the key to unlock the door  
I might make mistakes I made them before  
Think I hear about my life as a book  
Think I rather forget but they forced me to look  
Chorus:  
(mirror image, mirror image)  
If it isn't in black and white  
(it never happened)  
(mirror image) reflection of me  
Do you see what they want you to see?  
Looking at my life through mirror image  
Mirror image  
Must I confess everything that I've done?  
Can't a girl go out and have herself some fun?  
I don't wanna be judge I don't want the blame  
Living for the day is how I play the game  
There always a dream there's always a stage  
Somebody's looking now it's on the front page  
Through my rear view mirror I can see where I've been  
I forget the beginning and I can't see the end  
Chorus  
Only I hold the key to unlock the door  
I might make mistakes I made them before  
Think I hear about my life as a book  
Think I rather forget but they forced me to look  
Chorus x 2 (ad libs)  

MISS SUBWAY OF 1952  
WRITER MARY F. CAIN  
To my idol the divine  
Hope this never happens to us  
[Chorus:]  
She may look a little worn out  
She may have a couple of gray hairs  
A little ragged a little haggard  
A few wrinkles here and there  
But you should of seen her 21 years ago  
She would of captivated you  
Why she was Miss Subway of 1952  
She had a stunting figure  
And her hips weren't any bigger  
Than her bust line  
She's gotten just a little saggy  
And her skin's a trifle baggy  
But there was a time  
When everything was perfectly place  
She had a beautiful face  
She may look a little made up  
Especially around the eyes  
A little groupie, a little droopy  
But once they were quit a prize  
Yes you should of seen her 21 years ago  
They were a devastating view  
Why she was Miss Subway of 1952  
She had a million men around her  
Giving gifts that would astound her  
Why she couldn't even walk down the street  
Yeah she had lovers by the dozen  
And she even had some cousins  
Who just couldn't stop  
Throwing themselves at her feet  
She was so dainty and sweet  
[Chorus]  
  

More than you know, more than you know  
Man of my heart, I love you so  
Lately I find you on my mind  
More than you know  
Whether you're right, whether you're wrong  
Man of my heart I'm gonna string along  
I need you so, more than you'll ever know  
  
[Chorus]  
Loving you the way that I do  
There's nothing I can do about it  
Loving may be all you can give  
But honey I can't live without it  
  
Oh how I cry, oh how I die  
If you got tired and said goodbye  
More than I chose  
More than you'll ever know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh how I cry, oh how I die  
If you got tired and said goodbye  
More than I chose  
More than you'll ever know  
  
[Chorus]
