Watching all the insects march along  
Seem to know just right where they belong  
Smears a face reflecting in the chrome  
Hiding in the crowd, I'm all alone  
No one's heard a single word I've said  
They don't sound as good outside my head  
It looks as though the past is here to stay  
I've become a million miles aw-  
Why do you get all the love in the world?  
Why do you get all the love in the world?  
  
All the jagged edges disappear  
Colors all are brighter when you're near  
The stars are all afire in the sky  
Sometimes I get so lonely, I could  
Why do you get all the love in the world?  
Why do you get all the love in the world?  
Why do you get all the love in the world?  
Why do you get all the love in the world?  
  
Why do you get all the love in the world?  
Why do you get all the love in the world?  
Why do you get all the love in the world?  
Why do you get all the love in the world?  
[repeat]

Breeze still carries the sound  
Maybe I'll disappear  
Tracks will fade in the snow  
You won't find me here  
  
Ice is starting to form  
Ending what had begun  
I am locked in my head  
With what I've done  
  
I know you tried to rescue me  
Didn't let anyone get in  
Left with a trace of all that was  
And all that could have been  
  
Please, take this  
And run far away, far away from me  
I am tainted  
The two of us were never meant to be  
All these pieces and promises and left behinds  
If only I could see  
In my nothing  
You meant everything, everything to me  
  
Gone  
Fading  
Everything  
  
And  
All that  
Could have been  
Could have been  
  
Please, take this  
And run far away, far as you can see  
I am tainted  
And happiness and peace of mind  
Were never meant for me  
All these pieces and promises and left behinds  
If only I could see  
In my nothing  
You meant everything, everything to me

I've tried to take this all just one step at a time,  
I'd love to reason but I'll end this waver signed.  
'Cause it's so lonely I feel like I have died  
I thought angels never learned to say goodbye  
  
Angel  
  
I've felt emotions like I've never felt before  
Felt such devotion that it's spilt upon the floor  
Now I'm so empty there's nothing left to hide  
I thought angels never learned to say goodbye  
  
I've got to find you, and remind you how it is  
My life's been shattered but inside I've found love exists  
Now I'm so frightened, Im so afraid to die  
I thought angels never learned to say goodbye.  
Bye bye,  
Bye bye.  
  
Angel, Angel.  
Now I'm so lonely, I'm so afraid to die.  
'Cause I know that all the angels say goodbye  
Angel  
Angel  
Bye bye, Angel.  
Bye bye.

I am all alone this time around  
Sometimes on the side I hear a sound  
Places parallel I know it's you  
Feel the little pieces bleeding through  
  
And on, this goes on  
And on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on  
This goes on  
And on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on  
  
Now that I've decided not to stay  
I can feel me start to fade away  
Everything is back where it belongs  
I will be beside you before long  
  
And on, this goes on  
And on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on  
This goes on  
And on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on  
  
We will never die  
Beside you in time  
We will never die  
Beside you in time

I am a big man  
(yes I am)  
And I have a big gun  
Got me a big old dick and I  
I like to have fun  
Held against your forehead  
I'll make you suck it  
Maybe I'll put a hole in your head  
You know just for the fuck of it  
I can reduce you if I want  
I can devour  
I'm hard as fucking steel and I've got the power  
I'm every inch a man and I'll show you somehow  
Me and my fucking gun  
Nothing can stop me now  
Shoot shoot shoot shoot shoot  
I'm going to come all over you  
Me and my fucking gun  
Me and my fucking gun

Taking over, assisting with my revelation  
Empty spaces, as if it was an invitation  
Your invasion, exceeding every expectation  
Now I feed from the many mouths of your persuasion  
Resurrection, infection, as I fade away  
There's no fear, there is nothing left to make me stay  
Fitting in my new skin, just tell me what to do  
I'm defined, I am blind, I am a part of you  
Big black bomb, attack  
Break down resist us, fight back

Now I am a part of you, attack  
Now I am a part of you, resist us, fight back

Ha-ha-haunted  
  
The throat is deep and the mouth is wide  
Saw some things on the other side  
Made me promise to never tell  
But you know me, I can't help myself  
  
Now I've got something you have to see  
They put something inside of me  
The smile is red and its eyes are black  
I don't think I'll be coming back  
  
I don't believe it  
I had to see it  
I came back haunted  
I came back haunted  
  
I said goodbye but I  
I had to try  
I came back haunted  
C-C-C-came back haunted  
  
Everywhere now reminding me  
I am not who I used to be  
I'm afraid this has just begun  
Consequences for what I've done, yeah  
  
I don't believe it  
I had to see it  
I came back, I came back haunted  
C-C-C-came back haunted  
  
I said goodbye but I  
I had to try  
I came back, I came back haunted  
I C-C-C-came back haunted  
  
I don't believe it  
I had to see it  
I came back, I came back haunted  
C-C-C-came back haunted  
  
I said goodbye but I  
I had to try  
I came back, I came back haunted  
C-C-C-came back haunted  
  
They tried to tell me but I  
I couldn't stop myself and I  
I came back, I came back haunted  
C-C-C-came back haunted  
  
Just can't  
Stop  
Came back ha-ha-haunted  
Just can't  
Stop  
Came back ha-ha-haunted  
Just can't  
Stop  
Came back ha-ha-haunted  
Just can't  
Stop

Just can't  
Stop  
Came back ha-ha-haunted  
Just can't  
Stop  
Came back ha-ha-haunted  
Just can't  
Stop  
Came back ha-ha-haunted  
Just can't  
Stop  
Came back ha-ha-haunted  
Just can't  
Stop  
Came back ha-ha-haunted  
Just can't  
Stop

I pushed the button and elected him to office, and  
He pushed the button, and he dropped the bomb  
You pushed the button, and could watch it on the television  
Those motherfuckers didn't last too long  
  
I'm sick of hearing 'bout the have and have-not's  
Have some personal accountability  
The biggest problem with the way that we are doing things is  
The more we let you have, the less that I'll be keeping for me  
  
Well, I used to stand for something  
Now I'm on my hands and knees  
Turning in my god for this one  
And he signs his name with a capital G  
  
Don't give a shit about the temperature in Guatemala  
Don't really see what all the fuss is about  
Ain't gonna worry about no future generations  
And I'm sure somebody's gonna figure it out  
  
Don't try to tell me that some power can corrupt a person  
You haven't had enough to know what it's like  
You're only angry 'cause you wish you were in my position  
Now nod your head because you know that I'm right, all right!  
  
Well, I used to stand for something  
But forgot what that could be  
There's a lot of me inside you  
Maybe you're afraid to see  
  
Well, I used to stand for something  
Now I'm on my hands and knees  
Turning in my god for this one  
And he signs his name with a capital G  
  
Well, I used to stand for something  
But forgot what that could be  
There's a lot of me inside you  
Maybe you're afraid to see  
  
Well, I used to stand for something  
Now I'm on my hands and knees  
Turning in my god for this one  
And he signs his name with a capital G

Through every forest, above the trees  
Within my stomach, scraped off my knees

Just like an animal  
You can have my isolation

You see through what I hide

Help me get inside  
I want to fuck you  
I want to taste you  
I want to feel you  
I want to be you

It keeps growing  
And I can feel it breathe  
I have been trying  
To behave myself  
It keeps growing  
And I can feel it breathe  
I have been trying  
To tolerate you  
  
Well I am reaching the point  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
I thought maybe  
I thought this would go away  
But it continues  
The only constant  
Every day  
Stronger  
  
I will use my voice  
And I will use my fist  
To destroy  
Everything I can  
  
Now I know  
What this is all about  
Now I know  
Exactly what I am  
  
These is a seed  
Inside of me  
That makes me

Am I  
Am I still tough enough?  
Feels like I'm wearing down (down down down down)  
Is my viciousness losing ground (ground ground ground ground)  
Am I taking too much?  
Did I cross the line? (line line)  
I need my role in this  
Very clearly defined  
  
I need your discipline  
I need your help  
I need your discipline  
You know once I start I cannot help myself  
  
Now it's starting up  
Feels like I'm losing touch  
Nothing matters to me  
Nothing matters as much  
I see you left a mark  
Up and down the skin (skin skin)  
I don't know where I end  
Or where you begin  
  
I need your discipline  
I need your help  
I need your discipline  
You know once I start I cannot help myself  
  
I cannot stop myself  
Once I start I cannot stop myself  
And you know  
Once I start I cannot stop myself  
And you know  
Once I start I cannot stop myself  
And you know  
Once I start I cannot stop myself  
And you know  
Once I start I cannot stop myself  
  
I need your discipline  
And you know  
I need your help  
Once I start I cannot stop myself  
I need your discipline  
And you know  
Because once I start I cannot stop myself  
  
I need your discipline  
And you know  
I need your help  
Once I start I cannot stop myself  
I need your discipline  
And you know  
Because once I start I cannot stop myself  
  
And you know  
Once I start I cannot stop myself  
And you know  
Once I start I cannot stop myself  
I need your discipline  
And you know  
Once I start I cannot stop myself  
I need your discipline  
And you know  
Cannot stop myself  
Once I start I cannot stop myself

Kinda like a cloud I was up way up in the sky.  
And I was feeling some feelings you wouldn't believe.  
Sometimes I don't believe them myself and I decided I was never coming down.  
Just then a tiny little dot caught my eye.  
It was just about too small to see.  
But I watched it way too long.  
That dot was pulling me down.  
  
[Chorus:]  
I was up above it.  
I was up above it.  
I was up above it.  
I was up above it.  
Now I'm down in it  
Shut up.  
  
So what what does it matter now.  
I was swimming in the hate now I crawl on the ground.  
And everything I never liked about you is kind of seeping into me.  
I try to laugh about it now but isn't it funny how everything works out.  
I guess the jokes on me.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I used to be so big and strong.  
I used to know my right from wrong.  
I used to never be afraid.  
I used to be somebody.  
I used to have something inside.  
Now just this hole it's open wide.  
Used to want it all.  
I used to be somebody.  
I'll cross my heart and hope to die.  
But the needle's already in my eye.  
And all the world's weight is on my back and I don't even know why.  
And what I used to think was me is just a fading memory.  
I looked him right in the eye and said "goodbye."  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Rain rain go away.  
Come again some other day.  
Chorus  
Na na na na na na na na.

I woke up today  
To find myself in the other place  
With a trail of footprints  
From where I ran away  
It seems everything I've heard  
Just might be true  
And you know me  
(well you think you do)  
Sometimes, I have everything - yet I wish I felt something  
  
Do you know how far this has gone?  
Just how damaged have I become?  
When I think I can overcome  
It runs even deeper  
  
And in a dream I'm a different me  
With a perfect you  
We fit perfectly  
And for once in my life I feel complete  
And I still want to ruin it  
Afraid to look  
As clear as day  
This plan has long been underway  
  
I hear them call  
I cannot stay  
The voice inviting me away  
  
Do you know how far this has gone?  
Just how damaged have I become?  
When I think I can overcome  
It runs even deeper  
Everything that matters is gone  
All the hands of hope have withdrawn  
Could you try to help me hang on?  
It runs...  
  
I straight  
I won't crack  
On my way  
And I can't turn back  
I'm okay  
I'm on track  
On my way  
And I can't turn back  
I stayed  
On this track  
Gone too far  
And I can't come back  
I stayed  
On this track  
Lost my way  
Can't come back

Perfect little dream the kind that hurts the most  
Forgot how it feels well almost  
No one to blame always the same  
Open my eyes wake up in flames  
It took you to make me realize  
It took you to make me realize  
It took you to make me realize?  
It took you to make me see the light  
Smashed up my sanity  
Smashed up my integrity  
Smashed up what I believed in  
Smashed up what's left of me  
Smashed up my everything  
Smashed up all that was true  
Gonna smash myself to pieces  
I don't know what else to do  
Covered in hope and Vaseline  
Still cannot fix this broken machine  
Watching the hole it used to be mine  
Just watching it burn in my steady systematic decline  
Of the trust I will betray  
Give it to me I throw it away  
After everything I've done I hate myself for what I've become  
I tried  
I gave up  
Throw it away

Get down, make love  
Get down, make love  
You take my body  
I give you heat  
You say you hungry  
I give you meat  
I suck your mind  
You blow my head  
Make love - (make love)  
Inside your bed - everybody get down, make love  
Get down, make love  
Get down, make love  
Get down, make love  
  
Every time I get hot  
You wanna cool down  
Every time I get high  
You say you wanna come down  
You say it's enough  
In fact it's too much  
Every time I get a - get down, get down  
Get down, make love  
  
Oh, sss, hah  
  
I can squeeze - you can shake me (get down, make love)  
I can feel - when you break me (get down, make love)  
Come on so heavy - when you take me (get down, make love)  
You can make love, you can make love, you can make love, you can make love  
(Get down, make love)  
You can make everybody get down, make love  
Get down, make love  
  
Every time I get high  
You wanna come down  
Every time I get hot  
You say you wanna cool down  
You say it's enough  
In fact it's too much  
Every time I wanna, get down  
Get down, get down  
  
Aah, ooh, make love, make love, make love, make love, make love  
Aah, oh  
  
Get down, make love  
Get down, make love  
Get down, make love  
Get down, make love  
  
Every time I get hot  
You wanna cool down  
Every time I get high  
You say you wanna come down  
You say it's enough  
In fact it's just too much  
Every time I wanna, get down  
Get down, get down, make love  
Get down, make love  
Get down, make love

Hey, man, please don't make a sound  
Take a look around  
Can't you see what's right in front of you?  
Have a little taste  
No more time to waste  
You don't wanna get left behind 'cause it's all coming down right now  
  
How hard is it to see?  
Put your faith in me  
'Cause you wouldn't want to be  
Praying to the wrong piece of wood  
You should get where you belong  
Everything you know is wrong  
Come on, sing along, everybody now  
  
(God given)  
  
[Chorus:]  
And He gives us sight  
And we see the light  
And it burns so bright  
Now we know we're right  
It is kingdom come  
And Thy will be done  
We have just begun  
We're the chosen ones  
  
(I would never tell you anything that wasn't absolutely true that hadn't come
right from  
His mouth that He wants me to tell you)  
  
Wait  
Step into the light  
How can this be right?  
I'm afraid we're going to ask you to leave  
Guess you cannot win  
With the color of your skin  
You won't be getting in to the Promised Land  
This is just another case  
You people still don't know your place  
Step aside, out the way, wipe that look off your face  
'Cause we are the divine  
Separated from the swine  
Come on, sing along, everybody now  
  
(God given)  
  
[Chorus x 2]  
  
(I would never tell you anything that wasn't absolutely true that hadn't come
right from  
His mouth that He wants me to tell you)  
  
(God given)

Slave screams he thinks he knows what he wants  
Slave screams thinks he has something to say  
Slave screams he hears but doesn't want to listen  
Slave screams he's being beat into submission  
Don't open your eyes you won't like what you see  
The devils of truth steal the souls of the free  
Don't open your eyes take it from me  
I have found  
You can find  
Happiness is slavery  
Slave screams he spends his life learning conformity  
Slave screams he claims he has his own identity  
Slave screams he's going to cause the system to fall  
Slave screams but he's glad to be chained to that wall  
Don't open your eyes you won't like what you see  
The blind have been blessed with security  
Don't open your eyes take it from me  
I have found  
You can find  
Happiness is slavery  
I don't know what I am I don't know where I've been  
Human junk just words and so much skin  
Stick my hands through the cage of this endless routine  
Just some flesh caught in this big broken machine

You  
What you looking at?  
Head down  
Too late for that  
What you want  
What you get  
Know your place  
Don't ever forget  
  
And this is not my face  
And this is not my life  
And there is not a single thing here  
I can recognize  
This is all a dream  
And none of you are real  
I'll give anything  
I'll give anything  
Hey you  
What you running from?  
All your hate  
What you've become  
Bet you didn't think  
It would happen to you  
All used up  
Half way through  
  
And this is not my face  
And this is not my life  
And there is not a single thing here  
I can recognize  
This is all a dream  
And none of you are real  
I'll give anything  
I'll give anything

God money I'll do anything for you.  
God money just tell me what you want me to.  
God money nail me up against the wall.  
God money don't want everything he wants it all.  
No you can't take it  
No you can't take it  
No you can't take that away from me  
No you can't take it  
No you can't take it  
No you can't take that away from me  
Head like a hole.  
Black as your soul.  
I'd rather die than give you control.  
Head like a hole.  
Black as your soul.  
I'd rather die than give you control.  
Bow down before the one you serve.  
You're going to get what you deserve.  
Bow down before the one you serve.  
You're going to get what you deserve.  
God money's not looking for the cure.  
God money's not concerned with the sick among the pure.  
God money let's go dancing on the backs of the bruised.  
God money's not one to choose  
No you can't take it  
No you can't take it  
No you can't take that away from me  
No you can't take it  
No you can't take it  
No you can't take that away from me  
Head like a hole.  
Black as your soul.  
I'd rather die than give you control.  
Head like a hole.  
Black as your soul.  
I'd rather die than give you control.  
Bow down before the one you serve.  
You're going to get what you deserve.  
Bow down before the one you serve.  
You're going to get what you deserve.  
Bow down before the one you serve.  
You're going to get what you deserve.  
Bow down before the one you serve.  
You're going to get what you deserve.  
Head like a hole.  
Black as your soul.  
I'd rather die than give you control.  
Head like a hole.  
Black as your soul.  
I'd rather die than give you control.  
Bow down before the one you serve.  
You're going to get what you deserve.  
Bow down before the one you serve.  
You're going to get what you deserve.  
You know who you are.

Everything is catching up with me.  
I await to find I'm not at all where I should be.  
And it feels I'm getting to the end.  
And it's hard to figure out what's real and what's pretend.  
  
To break from what we're tied too.  
God knows how much I've tried too.  
And I am still inside you.  
And I am still inside you.  
  
I escape every now and then.  
And to think I find myself back here again.  
And again.  
  
I used to know who I was until you came along.  
I return to the only place I've ever felt I belong.  
  
To break from what we're tied too.  
God knows how much I've tried too.  
And I am still inside you.  
And I am still inside you.

I hurt myself today,  
To see if I still feel,  
I focus on the pain,  
The only thing that's real,  
  
The needle tears a hole,  
The old familiar sting,  
Try to kill it all away,  
But I remember everything,  
  
[Chorus]  
What have I become,  
My sweetest friend,  
Everyone I know,  
Goes away in the end,  
  
And you could have it all,  
My empire of dirt,  
I will let you down,  
I will make you hurt,  
  
I wear this crown of thorns,  
Upon my liars chair,  
Full of broken thoughts,  
I cannot repair,  
  
Beneath the stains of time,  
The feelings disappear,  
You are someone else,  
I am still right here,  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And you could have it all,  
My empire of dirt,  
I will let you down,  
I will make you hurt,  
  
If I could start again,  
A million miles away,  
I will keep myself,  
I would find a way,

I hurt myself today  
To see if I still feel  
I focus on the pain  
The only thing that's real  
The needle tears a hole  
The old familiar sting  
Try to kill it all away  
But I remember everything  
What have I become?  
My sweetest friend  
Everyone I know  
Goes away in the end  
You could have it all  
My empire of dirt  
I will let you down  
I will make you hurt  
I wear my crown of shit  
On my liar's chair  
Full of broken thoughts  
I cannot repair  
Beneath the stain of time  
The feeling disappears  
You are someone else  
I am still right here  
What have I become?  
My sweetest friend  
Everyone I know  
Goes away in the end  
You could have it all  
My empire of dirt  
I will let you down  
I will make you hurt  
If I could start again  
A million miles away  
I would keep myself  
I would find a way

I'm losing ground  
You know how this world can beat you down  
I'm made of clay  
I fear I'm the only one who thinks this way  
I'm always falling down the same hill  
Bamboo puncturing this skin  
And nothing comes bleeding out of me just like a waterfall I'm  
Drowning in  
Two feet below the surface I can still make out your wavy face  
And if I could just reach you maybe I could leave this place  
I do not want this  
I do not want this  
I do not want this  
I do not want this  
Don't you tell me how I feel  
Don't you tell me how I feel  
Don't you tell me how I feel  
You don't know just how I feel  
I stay inside my bed  
I have lived so many lives all in my head  
Don't tell me that you care  
There really isn't anything, is there?  
You would know, wouldn't you?  
You extend your hand to those who suffer  
To those who know what it really feels like  
To those who've had a taste  
Like that means something  
And oh so sick I am  
And maybe I don't have a choice  
And maybe that is all I have  
And maybe this is a cry for help  
I do not want this  
I do not want this  
I do not want this  
I do not want this  
Don't you tell me how I feel  
Don't you tell me how I feel  
Don't you tell me how I feel  
You don't know just how I feel  
I want to know everything  
I want to be everywhere  
I want to fuck everyone in the world  
I want to do something that matters

What a pathetic stray of words  
Just leave them laying on the floor  
The one posted on the door  
Not over here, not anymore  
  
There I was a place I could have been  
Step over where it used to be  
Since you have let yourself  
Come in  
Some things I'd rather you not see  
  
See I keep lying to myself  
Don't know what else there is to do  
If I can be somebody else  
Well I think I would for you  
  
Didn't it seem like something more  
So long I can't remember when  
All this has happened all before  
And this will happened all again  
And I only have myself to blame  
And I only have myself to blame  
  
See I keep lying to myself  
Don't know what else there is to do  
If I can be somebody else  
Well I think I would for you  
See I keep lying to myself  
Don't know what else there is to do  
If I can be somebody else  
Well I think I would for you

What a dumbass I am  
I can't even rhyme these words  
What a dumbass I am  
I love napalm death  
  
Even though napalm death sucks  
Sucks large balls  
Megadeth is way better  
I hang out in malls  
  
I'm an idiot  
I watch looney tunes  
I'm an idiot  
I don't go to church  
I'm an idiot  
I like to smoke chairs  
I'm an idiot  
Shoot me please  
  
I can't get a girlfreind  
Because I suck  
I like to screw goats  
What a dumbass I am  
  
I'm an idiot  
I watch looney tunes  
I'm an idiot  
I don't go to church  
I'm an idiot  
I like to smoke chairs (don't ask me how)  
I'm an idiot  
Shoot me please!

As black as the night can get  
Everything is safer now  
There's always a way to forget  
Once you learn to find a way how  
  
In the blur of serenity  
Where did everything get lost?  
The flowers of naivete  
Buried in a layer of frost  
  
The smell of sunshine  
I remember sometimes  
  
Thought he had it all before they called his bluff  
Found out that his skin just wasn't thick enough  
Wanted to go back to how it was before  
Thought he lost everything  
Then he lost a whole lot more  
  
A fool's devotion  
Swallowed up in empty space  
The tears of regret  
Frozen to the side of his face  
  
The smell of sunshine  
I remember sometimes  
  
I've done all I can do  
Could I please come with you?  
Sweet smell of sunshine  
I remember sometimes

Watch the sun  
As it crawls across a final time  
And it feels like  
Like it was a friend  
  
It is watching us  
And the world we set on fire  
Do you wonder  
If it feels the same?  
  
And the sky is filled with light  
Can you see it?  
All the black is really white  
If you believe it  
  
As your time is running out  
Let me take away your doubt  
You can find a better a place  
In this twilight  
  
Dust to dust  
Ashes in your hair remind me  
What it feels like  
And I won't feel again  
  
Night descends  
Could I have been a better person?  
If I could only do it all again...  
  
And the sky is filled with light  
Can you see it?  
All the black is really white  
If you believe it  
And the longing that you feel  
You know none of this is real  
You will find a better a place  
In this twilight

Split, split in two  
Somethin' else  
Shed precious skin  
Save yourself  
Bleed afterbirth  
What you're worth  
Yes, yes, of course  
It's gonna hurt  
  
Nature is violent  
The nature of the beast is violent  
You know that, and someone else  
Another one that wasn't me, no  
  
It's getting harder to tell the two of you apart  
It's getting harder to tell the two of you apart  
I can't believe I could never remember which one you are  
It's getting harder to tell the two of you apart  
  
Thrive, just become  
Your disease  
Leave them behind  
You are free  
Hey, what you want  
You deserve  
Yes, yes, of course  
This is gonna hurt  
  
It's getting harder to tell the two of you apart  
It's getting harder to tell the two of you apart  
I can't believe I could never remember which one you are  
It's getting harder to tell the two of you apart  
  
I just don't know anymore  
I just don't know anymore

Tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away  
  
Talking to myself all the way to the station  
Pictures in my head of the final destination all lined up  
(all the one's that aren't allowed to stay)  
Tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away  
  
Tried to save a place from the cuts and the scratches  
Tried to overcome the complications and the catches  
Nothing ever grows and the sun doesn't shine all day  
Tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away  
  
Tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away

The sky is painted black  
The smoke pours out the stack  
One hand upon your heart  
One hand behind your back  
You train us how to act  
You keep the fear intact  
The imminent attack  
Everything is right on track  
  
And we are letting you get away  
We are letting you get away with it  
  
Upon our plates to feed  
The dying left to bleed  
How much we really need  
Your politics of greed  
The cancer takes a hold  
The wolf is in the fold  
Our destiny's been sold  
We do just what we're told  
  
And we are letting you get away  
We are letting you get away with it  
  
Your armies filled with hate  
Believing your charade  
Begin to suffocate  
For us it's far too late  
  
And we are letting you get away  
We are letting you get away with it

The more that we take  
The paler we get  
I can't remember what it is  
We tried to forget  
  
The towel on the floor  
So cold it can sting  
In your eyes is a place  
Worth remembering  
  
Do you wake up and taste this  
And smash it apart  
I've gone all this fucking way  
To wind up back at the start  
  
Hey the closer we think we are  
Well it only got us so far  
Have you got anything left to show  
No no I didn't think so  
  
Hey the sooner we realize  
We cover ourselves with lies  
Well Underneath we're not so tough  
Oh love is not enough  
  
Well it hides in the dark  
Like the weaker and vain  
We didn't give it a mouth  
So it cannot complain  
  
We never really had a chance  
We never really make it through  
And to think I believed  
I believed I could get better with you  
  
Hey the closer we think we are  
Well it only got us so far  
Have you got anything left to show  
No no I didn't think so  
  
Hey the sooner we realize  
We cover ourselves with lies  
Well Underneath we're not so tough  
Oh love is not enough

Step right up march push  
Crawl right up on your knees  
Please greed feed (no time to hesitate)  
I want a little bit I want a piece of it I think he's losing it  
I want to watch it come down  
Don't like the look of it don't like the taste of it don't like the  
Smell of it  
I want to watch it come down  
All the pigs are all lined up  
I give you all that you want  
Take the skin and peel it back  
Now doesn't that make you feel better?  
Shove it up inside surprise! lies  
Stains like the blood on your teeth  
Bite chew suck away the tender parts  
I want to break it up I want to smash it up I want to fuck it up  
I want to watch it come down  
Maybe afraid of it let's discredit it let's pick away at it  
I want to watch it come down  
Now doesn't that make you feel better?  
The pigs have won tonight  
Now they can all sleep soundly  
And everything is all right

I can't believe that what I feel is really happening to me.  
Make it hurt.  
And point the finger at my insecurities.  
Well I guess I just don't understand about those complexities in your mind.  
And I guess I just don't understand why this world seems so unkind.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Maybe. Maybe just once. I get what's coming.  
Maybe. Maybe just once. I get what's coming to me.  
  
So once again the way you feel will never ever stay the same.  
And I'm to blame.  
I wonder just who made the rules up for this game.  
Well I guess I just don't understand about what you want and what you need.  
And I guess I just don't understand about how it has to be.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You sat down on this bed and you said  
"Christ, what the hell do you think this place is?"  
You know.  
He just couldn't believe it!  
And I said  
"I don't know but it sure is something different"  
So go ahead.  
You say those thousand things you think you have to say.  
Look at me.  
And tell me love's not such a hard word anyway.  
Well how can you count on me I thought you realized for sure.  
And how can you just believe.  
I thought I deserved just a little more.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh God.  
Oh what's coming to me.

Lay down imposition against a polished steel  
This is something different  
You like the way this feels  
No time for asking questions  
No time for wondering  
We've had enough of you now  
We've heard everything  
  
We're goin' to play a new game  
You put on this blindfold  
You do what we tell you  
You do as you're told  
Used to be the leader, but  
Now comes the time to serve  
Maybe we'll show some mercy  
Maybe you'll get what you deserve  
  
[Chorus:]  
Countdown to the end  
Gonna make it go faster  
Right around the bend  
This is gonna be a disaster, disaster  
Countdown to the end  
And we're here to go faster  
Come on down, my friend  
It's time to meet your master  
  
You've left quite a mess here  
Under your stewardship  
You thought you'd figured it out, but  
You'll find your place in this  
Nothing is so convincing  
For you to see the truth  
Give us so many things now  
We've got in store for you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Come on down, come on down, come on down  
Come on down, come on down, come on down  
Come on down, come on down, come on down  
Come on down, come on down, come on down  
Come on down, come on down, come on down  
Come on down, come on down, come on down  
Come on down, come on down, come on down

(what do your nipples look like)  
  
wherever i go  
  
i take a little piece of you  
  
i collect  
  
i reject  
  
photographs i took of you  
  
well times i passed through  
  
so many faces  
  
so many places  
  
i have got to have a memory  
  
i have never been there  
  
i have never had you  
  
i can't remember  
  
give me your reminder  
  
i collect  
  
i reject  
  
memorabilia  
  
(now girl..only it's flavor..bow down here)  
  
keychains and snowstorms  
  
the taste of your sweat  
  
the look in your eye  
  
i have been inside you  
  
i know what it feels like  
  
(wet as it is..the whiter the honey)  
  
i collect  
  
i reject  
  
memorabilia  
  
(goodies come in here all day)  
  
give me your reminder  
  
i can't remember  
  
i collect  
  
i reject  
  
memorabilia

We're in the building where they make us grow  
And I'm frightened by the liquid engineers  
Like you  
  
My Mallory heart is sure to fail  
I could crawl around the floor just like I'm real  
Like you  
  
The sound of metal I want to be you  
I should learn to be a man  
Like you  
  
Plug me in and turn me on  
Oh everything is moving  
  
I need my treatment it's tomorrow they send me  
Singing "I am an American"  
Do you?  
  
Picture this if I should make the change  
I'd like to pull the wires from the wall  
Did you?  
  
And who are you and how can I try  
Here inside I like the metal  
Don't you?  
  
All I know is no one dies  
I'm still confusing love with need

I am the voice inside your head and I control you  
I am the lover in your bed and I control you  
I am the sex that you provide and I control you  
I am the hate you try to hide and I control you  
I take you where you want to go  
I give you all you need to know  
I drag you down I use you up  
Mr. Self Destruct  
I speak religion's message clear and I control you  
I am denial guilt and fear and I control you  
I am the prayers of the naive and I control you  
I am the lie that you believe and I control you  
I take you where you want to go  
I give you all you need to know  
I drag you down I use you up  
Mr. Self Destruct  
I am the needle in your vein and I control you  
I am the high you can't sustain and I control you  
I am the pusher I'm a whore and I control you  
I am the need you have for more and I control you  
I am the bullet in the gun and I control you  
I am the truth from which you run and I control you  
I am the silencing machine and I control you  
I am the end of all your dreams and I control you  
I take you where you want to go  
I give you all you need to know  
I drag you down I use you up  
Mr. Self Destruct

You left your opening open wide  
And you let everyone come inside  
There's always something you've got to hide  
So you lied, and you lied, and you lied  
Make sure you grab everything that you need  
You've got a hole that you've got to feed  
You try to fill it all up with your greed  
But it bleeds, and it bleeds, and it bleeds  
Got take a little more  
We'll scrape you off the floor  
We love you anyhow  
But you're not so pretty now  
A great big superstar  
Is what you think you are  
We love you anyhow  
But you're not so pretty now  
Nobody burns quite as bright  
Well goddamn, maybe you're right  
There's always battles there for you to fight  
And you might, you might, you just might  
But there is something I gotta say  
There is a price you know you pay  
Try as hard as you can to stay  
He's just fading, and fading, and fading the fuck away  
Go take a little more  
We'll scrape you off the floor  
We love you anyhow  
But you're not so pretty now  
A great big superstar  
Is what you think you are  
We love you anyhow  
But you're not so pretty now  
Better turn the lights down low  
The cracks begin to show  
We love you anyhow  
But you're not so pretty now  
And soon you will be gone  
And we will all have one  
You never mattered anyhow  
And you're not so pretty now  
  

I'm becoming less defined  
As days go by  
Fading away  
Well you might say  
I'm losing focus  
Kinda drifting into the abstract  
In terms of how I see myself  
  
Sometimes  
I think I can see right through myself  
Sometimes  
I think I can see right through myself  
Sometimes  
I can see right through myself  
  
Less concerned  
About fitting into the world  
Your world, that is  
'cause it doesn't really matter  
Any more  
No, it doesn't really matter  
Any more  
None of this really matters  
Any more  
  
Yes I am alone  
But then again I always was  
As far back as I can tell  
I think maybe it's because  
Because you were never really real  
To begin with  
  
I just made you up  
To hurt myself  
I just made you up  
To hurt myself  
I just made you up  
To hurt myself  
(repeat)  
And it worked  
Yes it did  
  
There is no you  
There is only me  
There is no you  
There is only me  
There is no fucking you  
There is only me  
There is no fucking you  
There is only me  
  
Only only only  
  
Well the tiniest little dot caught my eye  
And it turned out to be a scab  
And I had this funny feeling  
Like I just knew it's something bad  
  
I just couldn't leave it alone  
I cut off that scab  
It was a doorway trying to seal itself shut  
But I climbed through  
  
Now I'm somewhere  
I am not supposed to be  
And I can see things I know  
I really shouldn't see  
  
And now I know why  
Now I know why  
Things aren't as pretty  
On the inside  
  
There is no you  
There is only me  
There is no you  
There is only me  
There is no fucking you  
There is only me  
There is no fucking you  
There is only me  
  
Only only only only only only?

I want to take you baby  
I want to take you out  
I want to wine and dine you  
Oh I want to twist and twist and shout  
I want you hot in my arms  
So soft on my bed  
You get the key to my heart  
Oh when you wear that sweet dress  
  
But you're too physical physical to me  
You're just too physical physical no to me  
  
I want your rough house baby  
I want this right in your ear  
You let me feel your danger  
I let you make this feeling clear here  
I want the touch of your charms  
The heat of your breath  
I want to say all those things  
That would be better unsaid  
No  
  
But you're too physical physical to me  
You're just too physical oh  
You're too physical for me  
You're too physical to me  
You're really jus- just too- just  
Too really fuck no  
  
You're just too physical [x2]  
Too fucking physical  
No [x7]  
Oh you're too physical  
Just too physical  
Just too

Hey pig  
Yeah you  
Hey pig piggy pig pig pig  
All of my fears came true  
Black and blue and broken bones you left me here I'm all alone  
My little piggy needed something new  
Nothing can stop me now  
I don't care anymore  
Nothing can stop me now  
I just don't care  
Hey pig  
Nothing's turning out the way I planned  
Hey pig there's a lot of things I hoped you could help me understand  
What am I supposed to do I lost my shit because of you  
Nothing can stop me now  
I don't care anymore  
Nothing can stop me now  
I just don't care  
Nothing can stop me now  
You don't need me anymore

She spread herself wide open to let the insects in  
She leaves a trail of honey to show me where she's been  
She has the blood of reptile just underneath her skin  
Seeds from a thousand others drip down from within  
Oh my beautiful liar  
Oh my precious whore  
My disease my infection  
I am so impure  
Devils speak of the ways in which she'll manifest  
Angels bleed from the tainted touch of my caress  
Need to contaminate to alleviate this loneliness  
I now know the depths I reach are limitless  
Oh my beautiful liar  
Oh my precious whore  
My disease my infection  
I am so impure

See the animal in his cage that you built,  
Are you sure what side you're on?  
Better not look him too closely in the eye,  
Are you sure what side of the glass you are on?  
See the safety of the life you have built,  
Everything where it belongs  
Feel the hollowness inside of your heart,  
And it's all right where it belongs  
  
What if everything around you,  
Isn't quite as it seems?  
What if all the world you think you know,  
Is an elaborate dream?  
And if you look at your reflection,  
Is it all you want it to be?  
What if you could look right through the cracks,  
Would you find yourself find yourself afraid to see?  
  
What if all the world's inside of your head?  
Just creations of your own  
Your devils and your gods all the living and the dead  
And you really oughta know  
You can live in this illusion  
You can choose to believe  
You keep looking but you can't find the ones,  
Are you hiding in the trees?  
  
What if everything around you,  
Isn't quite as it seems?  
What if all the world you used to know,  
Is an elaborate dream?  
And if you look at your reflection,  
Is it all you want it to be?  
What if you could look right through the cracks,  
Would you find yourself find yourself afraid to see?

Well you've got me working so hard lately.  
Working my hands until they bleed.  
If I was twice the man I could be.  
I'd still be half of what you need  
Still you lead me and I follow  
All of your back up to your chin.  
Over to the tip of your switchblade as you pull it out and stick it in.  
  
[Chorus:]  
(Twist Twist Twist) we can go a little deeper.  
(Twist Twist Twist) I'm wearing these chains.  
(Twist Twist Twist) you make it hurt real good.  
(Twist,Twist,Twist) I love the pain.  
  
Well you just leave me nailed here.  
Hanging like Jesus on the cross.  
I'm just dying for your sins.  
And aiding to the cause.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Wrap my soul in bandages.  
I'm tired of this war.  
Go ahead and cut me.  
I can't even feel it anymore.  
  
[Chorus]

So impressed with all you do  
Tried so hard to be like you  
Flew too high and burnt the wing  
Lost my faith in everything  
  
Lick around divine debris  
Taste the wealth of hate in me  
Shedding skin succumb defeat  
This machine is obsolete  
  
Made the choice to go away  
Drink the fountain of decay  
Tear a hole exquisite red  
Fuck the rest and stab it dead  
  
Broken bruised forgotten sore  
Too fucked up to care anymore  
Poisoned to my rotten core  
Too fucked up to care anymore  
  
In the back off the side far away is a place where I hide where I  
Stay tried to say tried to ask I needed to all alone by myself where  
Were you?  
How could I ever think it's funny how everything that  
Swore it wouldn't change is different now just like you  
Would always say we'll make it through then my head fell apart  
And where were you?  
How could I ever think it's funny how everything you swore would  
Never change is different now like you said you and me make it  
Through didn't quite fell apart  
Where the fuck were you?

My god sits in the back of the limousine  
My god comes in a wrapper of cellophane  
My god pouts on the cover of the magazine  
My god's a shallow little bitch trying to make the scene  
  
I have arrived and this time you should believe the hype  
I listened to everyone now I know that everyone was right  
I'll be there for you as long as it works for me  
I play a game  
It's called insincerity

All our pain  
How did we ever get by without you?  
You're so vain  
I bet you think this song is about you  
Don't you?  
Don't you?  
Don't you?  
Don't you?  
  
Now I belong I'm one of the chosen ones  
Now I belong I'm one of the beautiful ones

There is no god up in the sky tonight  
No sign of heaven anywhere in sight  
All that was true is left behind  
Once I could see now I am blind  
Don't want your dreams you try to sell  
This disease I give to myself  
How does it feel?  
How does it feel?  
She makes it sweeter than the sun  
I get too tight I come undone  
I bow my head to confess  
The temple walls are made of flesh  
Runs up my arms 'til I'm on track  
Itches my skin right off of my back  
I'll heal your wounds  
I'll set you free  
I'm Jesus Christ on Ecstasy  
How does it feel?  
How does it feel?  
I am so dirty on the inside  
I am so dirty on the inside  
I am so dirty on the inside  
I am so dirty on the inside  
How does it feel?  
How does it feel?  
Suck  
Suck  
Suck  
Suck  
A thousand lips a thousand tongues  
A thousand throats a thousand lungs  
A thousand ways to make it true  
I want to do terrible things to you

Sunspots cast a glare in my eyes  
Sometimes I forget I'm alive  
I feel it coming and I've gotta get out of it's way  
I hear it calling and I come cause I can't disobey  
I should not listen and I shouldn't believe  
But I do, yes I do  
  
She turns me on  
She makes it real  
I have to to apologize  
For the way I feel  
  
My life it seems has taken a turn  
Why, in the name of God, would I ever want to return  
  
Peel off our skin, we're gonna burn what we were to the ground  
Fuck in the fire and we'll spread all the ashes around  
I want to kill away the rest of what's left  
And I do, yes I do  
  
She turns me on  
She makes it real  
I have to to apologize  
For the way I feel  
  
And nothing can stop me now  
There is nothing to fear  
And everything that ever was  
Is inside us here  
  
Whoa, whoa, whoa  
Inside us here  
  
Now I just stare into the sun  
And I see everything I've done  
I think I could've been someone  
But I can't stop what has begun  
When everything's been said and done  
And there is no place left to run  
I think I have to be someone  
Now I just stare into the sun

Hey God why are you doing this to me?  
Am I not living up to what I'm supposed to be?  
Why am I seething with this animosity?  
Hey God I think you owe me a great big apology  
Terrible lie  
Terrible lie  
Terrible lie  
Terrible lie  
Hey God I really don't know what you mean.  
Seems like salvation comes only in our dreams.  
I feel my hatred grow all the more extreme.  
Hey God can this world really be as sad as it seems  
Terrible lie  
Terrible lie  
Terrible lie  
Terrible lie  
Don't take it away from me.  
I need someone to hold on to.  
Don't take it away from me.  
I need someone to hold on to  
Hey God, there's nothing left for me to hide.  
I lost my ignorance, security and pride.  
I'm all alone in a world you must despise.  
Hey God, I believed that promises, your promises and lies  
Terrible lie  
Terrible lie  
Terrible lie  
Terrible lie  
You made me throw it all away.  
My morals left to decay.  
How many you betray.  
You've taken everything  
Terrible lie  
Terrible lie  
Terrible lie  
Terrible lie  
My head is filled with disease.  
My skin is begging you please.  
I'm on my hands and knees  
I want so much to believe.  
Don't take it away from me.  
I need someone to hold on to.  
Don't take it away from me.  
I need someone to hold on to  
I give you everything.  
My sweet everything  
Hey God, I really don't know who I am.  
In this world of piss

Just when everything was making sense.  
You took away all my self confidence.  
Now all that I've been hearing must be true.  
I guess I'm not the only boy for you.  
  
[Chorus:]  
But that's what I get  
That's what I get  
That's what I get  
That's what I get  
  
How could you turn us into this?  
After you just taught me how to kiss you.  
I told you I'd never say goodbye.  
I'm slipping on the tears you made me cry.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
For trusting you.  
That's what I get.  
Why does it come as a surprise.  
To think that I was so naive.  
Maybe didn't mean too much.  
But it meant everything to me.  
  
[Chorus]

I beat my machine it's a part of me it's inside of me  
I'm stuck in this dream it's changing me I am becoming  
The me that you know had some second thoughts  
He's covered with scabs and he is broken and sore  
The me that you know doesn't come around much  
That part of me isn't here anymore  
All pain disappears it's the nature of my circuitry  
Drowns out all I hear there's no escape from this my new consciousness  
That me that you know used to have feelings  
But the blood has stopped pumping and he's left to decay  
The me that you know is now made up of wires  
And even when I'm right with you I'm so far away  
I can try to get away but I've strapped myself in  
I can try to scratch away the sound in my ears  
I can see it killing away all my bad parts  
I don't want to listen but it's all too clear  
Hiding backwards inside of me I feel so unafraid  
Annie, hold a little tighter I might just slip away  
It won't give up it wants me dead  
Goddamn this noise inside my head

There is a game I play  
Try to make myself okay  
Try so hard to make the pieces all fit  
Smash it apart  
Just for the fuck of it  
  
Bye bye oooh  
Got to get back to the bottom  
Bye bye oooh  
The big come down isn't that what you wanted?  
Bye bye oooh  
Find a place with the failed and forgotten  
Bye bye oooh  
Isn't that really what you wanted now?  
  
There is no place I can go there is no way I can hide  
It feels like it keeps coming from the inside  
  
There is a hate that burns within  
The most desperate place I have ever been  
Try to get back to where I'm from  
The closer I get the worse it becomes  
The closer I get the worse it becomes  
  
There is no place I can go there is no place I can hide  
It feels like it keeps coming from the inside

I pick things up, I am a collector  
And things, well things, they tend to accumulate  
I have this net, it drags behind me  
It picks up feelings for me to feed upon  
  
There are times, plenty of times  
I wish I could let it go  
But it's time to breed  
And it's got to grow inside me  
  
There are times, plenty of times  
I wish I could let it go  
But it's time to make me think things  
I don't want to know  
  
I'm trying to fit it all inside  
I'm trying to open my mouth wide  
I'm trying not to choke  
And swallow it all  
Swallow it all  
Swallow it all  
Swallow it all  
  
I am the plague  
I am the swarm  
All your heart sticks on me  
And I keep it warm  
  
It'll make me stay  
It won't let me leave  
There are so goddamn many of them  
It gets hard to breathe  
  
I'm trying to fit it all inside  
I'm trying to open my mouth wide  
I'm trying not to choke inside  
I am a good boy, and I will  
Swallow it all  
Swallow it all  
Swallow it all  
Swallow it all  
  
Every last one [19x]

Staring at the sea  
Will she come?  
Is there hope for me  
After all is said and done  
Anything at any price  
All of this for you  
All the spoils of a wasted life  
All of this for you  
All the world has closed her eyes  
Tried faith all worn and thin  
For all we could have done  
And all that could have been  
  
Ocean pulls me close  
And whispers in my ear  
The destiny I've chose  
All becoming clear  
The currents have their say  
The time is drawing near  
Washes me away  
Makes me disappear  
  
I descend from grace  
In arms of undertow  
I will take my place  
In the great below  
  
I can still feel you  
Even so far away

Say your name  
Try to speak as clearly as you can  
You know everything gets written down  
Nod your head  
Just in case they could be watching with their shiny satellite  
  
[Chorus:]  
I hope they cannot see  
The limitless potential  
Living inside of me  
To murder everything  
I hope they cannot see  
I am the great destroyer  
  
Turn it up  
Listen to the shit they pump into  
Your head  
Filling you with apathy  
Hold your breath  
Wait until you know the time is right  
On time  
The end is near  
  
[Chorus]

You're keeping in step  
In the line  
Got your chin held high and you feel just fine  
Because you do  
What you're told  
But inside your heart it is black and it's hollow and it's cold  
  
Just how deep do you believe?  
Will you bite the hand that feeds?  
Will you chew until it bleeds?  
Can you get up off your knees?  
Are you brave enough to see?  
Do you want to change it?  
  
What if this whole crusade's  
A charade  
And behind it all there's a price to be paid  
For the blood  
On which we dine  
Justified in the name of the holy and the divine  
  
Just how deep do you believe?  
Will you bite the hand that feeds?  
Will you chew until it bleeds?  
Can you get up off your knees?  
Are you brave enough to see?  
Do you want to change it?  
  
So naive  
To keep holding on to what I want to believe  
I can see  
But I keep holding on and on and on and on  
  
Will you bite the hand that feeds you?  
Will you stay down on your knees?

There are things that I said I would never do  
There are fears that I can not believe have come true  
For my soul is too sick and too little too late  
And myself I have grown too weary to hate  
  
The more I stay in here  
The more it's not so clear  
The more I stay in here  
The more I disappear  
As far as I have gone  
I knew what side I'm on  
But now I'm not so sure  
The line begins to blur  
  
There's somebody on top of me  
I don't know I don't know  
Isn't anybody stopping me  
I don't know I don't know  
I won't try and hold my breath  
I don't know I don't know  
Just how far down can I go  
I don't know I don't know  
  
As I lie here and stare  
The fabric starts to tear  
It's far beyond repair  
And I don't really care  
As far as I have gone  
I knew what side I'm on  
But now I'm not so sure  
The line begins to blur

I can take it  
Sideways  
Sometimes  
Some things  
Waves  
Feel like  
I'm on the other side  
Of every feeling ever felt  
Hold it close  
... Screaming  
I've watched this scene a thousand times  
  
(so) I can taste it  
And in my head  
  
This is how it all begins  
Yes, I am becoming  
And this is how it all begins  
What did you expect?  
This is not an exit  
This has begun  
  
The blackest eyes  
... Welcoming...  
I can almost see  
The new flesh  
A new disguise  
Please  
  
Give it to me  
I can take it  
  
Give it to me  
I can take it

I'm drunk.  
And right now I'm so in love with you.  
And I don't want to think too much about what we should or shouldn't do.  
Lay my hands on Heaven and the sun and the moon and the stars.  
While the devil wants to fuck me in the back of his car.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Nothing quite like the feel of something new.  
Maybe I'm all messed up.  
Maybe I'm all messed up.  
Maybe I'm all messed up in you.  
Maybe I'm all messed up.  
Maybe I'm all messed up.  
Maybe I'm all messed up.  
Maybe I'm all messed up in you.  
Maybe I'm all messed up.  
This is the only time I really feel alive.  
This is the only time I really feel alive.  
I swear.  
  
I just found everything I need.  
The sweat in your eyes the blood in your veins are listening to me.  
Well I want to wrap it up and swim in it until I drown.  
My moral standing is lying down.  
  
[Chorus]

I got my head but my head is unraveling  
Can't keep control can't keep track of where it's traveling  
I got my heart but my heart's no good  
You're the only one that's understood  
I come along but I don't know where you're taking me  
I shouldn't go but you reaching back and shaking me  
Turn off the sun pull the stars from the sky  
The more I give to you the more I die  
And I want you  
You are the perfect drug the perfect drug  
The perfect drug, the perfect drug  
You make me hard when I'm all soft inside  
I see the truth when I'm all stupid-eyed  
The arrow goes straight through my heart  
Without you everything just falls apart  
My blood just wants to say hello to you  
My soul is so afraid to realize  
How every little bit is left of me  
And I want you  
You are the perfect drug the perfect drug the perfect drug  
Take me with you  
Without you everything just falls apart  
It's not as much fun to pick up the pieces

And I want you  
You are the perfect drug  
The perfect drug  
The perfect drug  
  
And I want you  
  
You are the perfect drug  
The perfect drug  
The perfect drug  
  
And I want you  
  
You are the perfect drug  
The perfect drug  
The perfect drug  
  
You are the perfect drug  
The perfect drug  
The perfect drug  
  
Annihilate  
  
You are the perfect drug  
The perfect drug  
The perfect drug  
You are the perfect drug  
You are the perfect drug  
The perfect drug  
The perfect drug  
  
Annihilate  
  
And I want you  
And I want you

Some say it was a warning  
Some say it was a sign  
I was standing right there  
When it came down from the sky  
The way it spoke to us  
You felt it from inside  
Said it was up to us  
Up to us to decide  
  
You've become a virus  
That has eaten up its host  
We've been watching you with all of our eyes  
And what you seem to value most  
  
So much potential  
Or so we used to say  
Your greed, self importance, and your arrogance  
You piss it all away  
  
We heard a cry  
We've come to intervene  
You will change your ways, and you will make amends  
Or we will wipe this place clean  
  
Your time is tick-tick-ticking away  
Your time is tick-tick-ticking away  
Your time is tick-tick-ticking away  
Your time is tick-tick-ticking away  
Your time is tick-tick-ticking away  
Your time is tick-tick-ticking away  
Ticking away

Just a reflection  
Just a glimpse  
Just a little reminder  
Of all the what abouts  
And all the might have  
Could have beens  
Another day  
Some other way  
But not another reason to continue  
And now you're one of us  
The wretched  
  
The hopes and prays  
The better days  
The far aways  
Forget it  
  
It didn't turn out the way you wanted it to  
It didn't turn out the way you wanted it to, did it?  
It didn't turn out the way you wanted it to  
It didn't turn out the way you wanted it to, did it?  
  
Now you know  
This is what it feels like  
Now you know  
This is what it feels like  
The clouds will part and the sky cracks open  
And god himself will reach his fucking arm through  
Just to push you down  
Just to hold you down  
Stuck in this hole with the shit and the piss  
And it's hard to believe it could come down to this  
Back at the beginning  
Sinking  
Spinning  
  
And in the end  
We still pretend  
The time we spend  
Not knowing when  
You're finally free  
And you could be  
But it didn't turn out the way you wanted it to  
It didn't turn out quite the way that you wanted it  
  
Now you know  
This is what it feels like  
Now you know  
This is what it feels like  
  
You can try to stop it but it keeps on coming  
You can try to stop it but

Well you've got me workin' so hard lately  
Workin' my hands untill they bleed  
If I was twice the man I could be  
I'd still be half of what you need  
Still you lead me and I follow  
From the small of your back up to your chin  
Over to the tip of your switchblade  
As you pull it out as you stick it in  
  
Twist twist twist  
It can go a little deeper  
Twist twist twist  
I'm wearin' these chains  
Twist twist twist  
You make it hurt real good  
Twist twist twist  
I love the pain  
  
Well you just leave me nailed here  
Hanging like Jesus on this cross  
I'm just dying for your sins  
An aide to the cause  
  
Twist twist twist  
It can go a little deeper  
Twist twist twist  
I'm wearin' these chains  
Twist twist twist  
You make it hurt real good  
Twist twist twist  
I love the pain  
  
Wrap my soul in bandages  
I'm tired of this war  
Go ahead and cut me  
I can't even feel it anymore  
  
Twist twist twist  
It can go a little deeper  
Twist twist twist  
I'm wearin' these chains  
Twist twist twist  
You make it hurt real good  
Twist twist twist  
But I love  
Love the pain  
  
Twist twist twist  
It can go a little deeper  
Twist twist twist  
I'm wearin' these chains  
Twist twist twist  
Make it hurt real good  
Twist twist twist  
I love the pain  
  
Twist twist twist  
Twist twist twist  
Twist twist twist  
Twist twist twist  
  
(Turn it on... Turn it on...)  
  
Is this on?  
Oh.  
I'm so tired I can't get to sleep  
The squeaking of the bed  
Is right in time with the song that's repeating in my head  
It's uncomforting to remember  
How I used to like a good fuck every once in awhile  
I just wanted you to know  
That when I do it...  
  
I only think of you

Hallucinating half a day  
The pieces of a plan  
Instruction of the highest quality  
Bled from my own hand  
A line of little blueprint in my head  
The body lives  
It doesn't really matter anymore  
Yes it doesn't mean a thing  
  
I've gotta let go  
I've gotta get straight  
What do you have to make it so hard?  
Let me get away  
  
The wonders to the hall  
Days are so profound  
A place to bury everything I did  
And lie onto the ground  
If I illuminate I finally see  
The masterpiece itself  
I cannot tell the difference anymore  
I cannot trust myself  
  
I've gotta let go  
I've gotta get straight  
What do you have to make it so hard?  
Let me get away  
  
I've gotta let go  
I've gotta get straight  
What do I make the soul  
Let me get away  
  
I think I could lose myself in here  
I think I could lose myself in here  
I think I could lose myself in here  
I think I could lose myself in here  
  
I've gotta let go  
I've gotta get straight  
What do you have to make it so hard?  
Let me get away  
Got to let her know  
Find another way  
What do you have to make it so hard?  
Let me get away  
Away, away, away

I let you put it in my mouth  
I let it get under my skin  
I let you pump it through my veins  
I let you take me from within  
They tell us what we can and cannot do  
Same thing we've heard a hundred times before  
The way I put you inside of me  
None of that matters anymore  
  
My god, can we go any faster?  
Oh my god, I don't think I can last here  
My god, can we go any faster?  
Oh my god, I don't think I can last here  
  
I am you, and you are me  
You will never be alone  
But I have finally found my place in everything  
I have finally found my home  
I can leave all the best behind  
I can see right through the whole facade  
I am becoming something else  
I am turning into god  
  
My god, can we go any faster?  
Oh my god, I don't think I can last here  
My god, can we go any faster?  
Oh my god, I don't think I can last here  
(I don't think I can)  
My god, can we go any faster?  
Oh my god, I don't think I can last here  
My god, can we go any faster?  
Oh my god, I don't think I can last here

Only thing I've ever done  
Ticking time is running out  
  
Closest I've ever come  
Ticking time is running out  
  
Oh so tired on my own  
Ticking time is running out  
  
Best days I've ever known  
Ticking time is running out  
  
Yesterday I found out the world was ending  
Yesterday I found out the world was ending  
  
A little more  
Every day  
Falls apart and  
Slips away  
  
I don't mind  
I'm okay  
Wish it didn't  
Have to end this way  
  
These four walls are closing in  
Ticking time is running out  
  
Of all the things that might have been  
Ticking time is running out yeah  
  
Watch young love is fucking back  
Ticking time is running out yeah  
  
God forgive me if I cry  
Ticking time is running out  
  
A little more  
Every day  
Falls apart and  
Slips away  
  
I don't mind  
I'm okay  
Nothing ever  
Stays the same  
  
While we can  
Remember when  
Always running  
Even then  
  
Stay with me  
Hold me near  
  
And I'm still here

This is the first day of my last days  
I built it up now I take it apart climbed up real high now fall down  
Real far  
No need for me to stay the last thing left I just threw it away  
I put my faith in god and my trust in you  
Now there's nothing more fucked up I could do  
Wish there was something real wish there was something true  
Wish there was something real in this world full of you  
I'm the one without a soul I'm the one with this big fucking hole  
No new tale to tell twenty-six years on my way to hell  
Gotta listen to your big time hard line bad luck fist fuck  
Don't think you're having all the fun  
You know me I hate everyone  
Wish there was something real wish there was something true  
Wish there was something real in this world full of you  
I want to but I can't turn back  
But I want to
