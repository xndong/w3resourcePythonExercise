Standing by the wayside, begging for a ride  
I been waiting so long, a year has gone  
Look at all the people, strangers every one  
I've been looking so long, a year has gone  
  
You were all I lived for, I guess my life is through  
I've been living so long, a year has gone  
Lonely Sunday morning, rest in peace, my love  
You been sleeping so long, a year has gone  
  
How could I ever start to tell you  
The end is almost here?  
The song of love is riding in my ears  
Playing loud, playing clear  
The song will never change  
The memory will always be so near  
  
Standing by the wayside, begging for a ride  
I been waiting so long, a year has gone  
Look at all the people, strangers every one  
I've been looking so long, a year has gone

I'm a lay-by lover  
And you're just another  
Who just wants to hit and run  
Now your on your own  
'Cause I'm accident prone  
And I hope that you have your fun  
  
They say the devil loves his own  
And lady you just got the roll  
He drives you modus-operandi  
Well lady you don't get this soul  
What you call love I can't take no more  
Go knock on someone else's door  
  
I'm a lay-by lover  
And you're just another  
Who just wants to hit and run  
Now your on your own  
'Cause I'm accident prone  
And I hope that you have your fun  
  
'Cause you specialise your own kind of lies  
Lady you just hit and run  
I just want to say you keep driving that way  
And one day you will be undone  
  
I try to love you my way  
But lady you just wouldn't slow down  
You drove a right on through me  
When other guys came around  
What you call love wouldn't give to a stray  
I wouldn't treat a dog that way  
  
I'm a lay-by lover  
And you're just another  
Who just wants to hit and run  
Now your on your own  
''cause I'm accident prone  
And I hope that you have your fun  
  
'Cause you specialise your own kind of lies  
Lady you just hit and run  
I just want to say you keep driving that way  
And one day you will be undone  
  
One day you'll have to slow down  
And lady it could be too late  
You keep on acceleratin'  
And lady I could see your fate  
No-one wants a second-hand car  
They know it been push too far  
  
I'm a lay-by lover  
And you're just another  
Who just wants to hit and run  
Now your on your own  
'Cause I'm accident prone  
And I hope that you have your fun  
  
'Cause you specialise your own kind of lies  
Lady you just hit and run  
You're draggin'me down with this riding around  
And one day you will be undone  
  
I'm a lay-by lover  
And you're just another  
Who just wants to hit and run  
Now your on your own  
'Cause I'm accident prone  
And I hope that you have your fun

Throw away your old address book  
Of the guys you used to know  
Get all dressed up in your best look  
I'll take you to the movie show  
You look lovely when you're angry  
But I love the way you smile  
We could while away the hours  
Or we could walk another mile  
My darling, don't you ever change  
I don't think I'd be quite the same  
I thought I was in control  
I thought I was in control  
If I knew then what I know now  
Of the chances at the time  
Didn't know that I'd be missing  
A chance to lay it on the line  
I could have asked you if you needed  
Or maybe wanted to get out  
But it didn't really matter  
We got together anyhow  
My darling, don't you ever change  
I don't think I'd be quite the same  
I thought I was in control  
I thought I was in control  
Threw away your old address book  
Took a while to realize  
You'd be better off with someone  
What I mean is me and mine  
So what ya doing at the weekend?  
Shall we make it Friday night?  
Anywhere you fancy going  
And anyway with me's alright  
My darling, don't you ever change  
I don't think I'd be quite the same  
I thought I was in control  
I thought I was in control  
My darling, don't you ever change  
I don't think I'd be quite the same  
I thought I was in control  
I thought I was in control  

Once upon a time not so very long ago  
There wasn't such a thing as a rock'n roll show  
You had to sit at home and listen to the radio  
  
Then came a man with a rockin'guitar  
Found himself a beat and he played it near and far  
Everybody danced and sang and let the good times roll  
  
Again again again again, again again again again  
Why don't you do it, why don't you do it again  
Again again again again, again again again again  
Why don't you do it, why don't you do it again  
  
He travelled round the world in a rock-n-roll band  
He stood there like a giant with a guitar in his hand  
Everybody danced and sang and let the good times roll  
  
Nobody cared about the clothes he would wear  
Nobody cared about the colour of his hair  
Everybody came to see and let the good times roll  
  
Again again again again, again again again again  
Why don't you do it, why don't you do it again  
Again again again again, again again again again  
Why don't you do it, why don't you do it again  
  
Now we've got the rhythm in us now we've got the rock  
Time didn't matter never living by the clock  
Everybody came to hear him playing his rock-n-roll  
  
Then came a line when the music didn't rhyme  
He couldn't find the rhythm 'cause he couldn't find the time  
But still the people came to listen to the good times roll  
  
Again again again again, again again again again  
Why don't you do it, why don't you do it again  
Again again again again, again again again again  
Why don't you do it, why don't you do it again  
  
Again again again again, again again again again  
Why don't you do it, why don't you do it again  
Again again again again, again again again again  
Why don't you do it, why don't you do it again  
Why don't you do it, why don't you do it again

There's nothing left, there's nothing right  
There's nothing left, there's nothing right  
There's nothing left, right left right  
Up down up down up down up down  
  
All right all right  
You wind me up, you bring me down  
Your reputation is all over the town  
So long as you come home to me  
I ain't complaining  
  
You fool around, we scream and fight  
The way you are treating me, you know it ain't right  
But when you are making out with me  
I ain't complaining  
  
All right all right  
You're out all night, you sleep all day  
When I get home you're going out to play  
Oh, woman give me some time and everything's fine  
I ain't complaining  
  
You just don't care, we are in a Mess  
And the company you keep ain't the best  
But when you're lying there with me  
I ain't complaining  
  
It ain't no use, you playing it loose  
And thinking it don't matter to me  
It ain't fair at all  
You only have to call my name  
And I'll come running to you  
  
But when the chips are down  
A man can only take so much fooling around  
And if you don't come home to me  
I'll be complaining  
  
All right  
There's nothing left, there's nothing right  
Our situation ain't looking too bright  
'Cause I have taken all I'm Gonna take  
Without complaining  
  
It ain't no use playing it loose  
And thinking it don't matter to me  
It ain't fair at all  
You only have to call my name  
And I'll come running to you  
  
But when the chips are down  
A man can only take so much fooling around  
And if I don't come home to you  
You'll be complaining  
  
All right all right all right all right  
All right all right

All around my hat  
I will wear the green willow  
And all around my hat  
For a twelwe month and a day  
And if anyone should ask me  
The reason why I'm wearing it  
It's all for my true love  
Who's far far away  
  
Fare the well cold winter  
And fare the well cold frost  
But nothing have I gain  
But my own true love I've lost  
I'll sing and I'll be merry  
When occasion I do see  
She's a false deluded young girl  
Let here go farewell she  
  
And all around my hat  
I will wear the green willow  
And all around my hat  
For a twelwe month and a day  
And if anyone should ask me  
The reason why I'm wearing it  
It's all for my true love  
Who's far far away  
  
The other night she brought me  
A fine diamond ring but,  
She tought to have deprive me  
Of a far better thing  
But I being careful  
As lovers ought to be  
She's a false deluded young girl  
Let her go farewell she  
  
And all around my hat  
I will wear the green willow  
And all around my hat  
For a twelwe month and a day  
And if anyone should ask me  
The reason why I'm wearing it  
It's all for my true love  
Who's far far away  
  
All around my hat  
I will wear the green willow  
And all around my hat  
For a twelwe month and a day  
And if anyone should ask me  
The reason why I'm wearing it  
It's all for my true love  
Who's far far away

When I find myself in trouble and I need someone to lean on  
I only have to call and you're right there by my side  
When I can't see all the reasons why you have to be so far away  
I wonder if your love is really here to stay  
And I can't help my feelings and I can't hide my love for you  
And I'll always believe in all the things that you want me to  
  
When you're telling me not to worry ''cause you're being there won't be long  
I only live in hope that you just can't be wrong  
Because I can't help my feelings and I can't hide my love for you  
And I'll always believe in all the things that you want me to  
  
And I can't help my feelings and I can't hide my love for you  
And I'll always believe in all the things that you want me to

I want to have you here with me  
To cuddle up so near to me  
And do the things you like me to do to you  
You like it when I tickle you  
We start to kiss, it pleased you  
It gets so hot, I just don't know what to do  
  
To take you when you're feeling good  
To love you like I know I should  
It makes me feel all of ten feet tall  
  
So I just try to give to you  
All that I can to satisfy you  
I don't like to leave you girl  
Almost but not quite there  
  
So I just try to give to you  
All that I can to satisfy you  
I don't like to leave you girl  
Almost but not quite there  
  
Now when I finally get to you  
I'm gonna put my love to you  
And then I'll see just how good you are  
So I've got to have you here with me  
To cuddle up so near to me  
And do the things you like me to do to you  
  
So I just try to give to you  
All that I can to satisfy you  
I don't like to leave you girl  
Almost but not quite there

Riding along on the words of a song in my head  
Thinking all day of the thoughts in my mind never said  
I have needed a friend, over and over again  
Everyone sings of a God they have known  
Now I have a God of my own  
  
And it's better now, been a long, long time  
And it's better now that the words can rhyme  
  
Gotta have something to sing about, everyone must have a song  
Now I got something to sing about, everyone's singing my song  
Gotta have something to sing about, everyone must have a song  
Now I got something to sing about, everyone's singing my song  
  
Dreaming away, never wishing to be anyone  
Never a question or reason to find right or wrong  
When I looked at the end, over and over again  
Riding along on the words of a song  
Thinking my time had all gone  
  
And it's better now, been a long, long time  
And it's better now that the words can rhyme  
  
Gotta have something to sing about, everyone must have a song  
Now I got something to sing about, everyone's singing my song  
Gotta have something to sing about, everyone must have a song  
Now I got something to sing about, everyone's singing my song

You never listen when I say  
Only need another day  
You never listen when I tell you what I tell you  
I'm thinking what I'm thinkin'  
Need a little time to keep the motor tickin' over now  
  
Only need another day  
Gotta find another way  
We got a problem 'cause I don't know what you're thinkin'  
You don't care what I'm feelin'  
We better work it out or else there's gonna be a showdown now  
  
Why do you do what you do to me?  
You got no clue what you do to me  
Try to say but you couldn't see  
What do come don't come easily  
Only need another day  
  
But it comes and it goes and everybody knows  
That I don't like it, no I don't like it  
And when it flows and when it starts to go  
Then I like it, I sure do like it  
I hope the day never comes you throw it all away  
I only need another day  
  
You never listen when I  
You never listen when I say  
I only need another day  
You never listen when I tell you what I tell you  
I'm thinking what I'm thinkin'  
I need a little time to keep the motor tickin' over now  
  
I don't believe that we can't agree  
But I ain't letting that bother me  
I tried to say but you couldn't see  
What do come should come easily  
I only need another day  
  
But it comes and it goes and everybody knows  
That I don't like it, no I don't like it  
And when it flows and when it starts to go  
Then I like it, I sure do like it  
I hope the day never comes you throw it all away  
  
Another day, I need another day  
Another day, I need another day  
Another day, I need another day

I woke this morning in a different disguise  
And I was crying, crying  
You said it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter  
It really doesn't matter at all  
I caught the mirror as I opened your letter  
I was lying, lying  
I said it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter  
It really doesn't matter at all  
Another shipwreck, another heartbreak  
Another shipwreck, I understand that  
I may never see home again  
Another shipwreck, another heartbreak  
Another shipwreck, I understand that  
I may never see home again  
Scared to lose you but knowing the magic  
It was dying, dying  
I said it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter  
It really doesn't matter at all  
I hear you every day, I meet you at night  
I see you crying, crying  
You say it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter  
It really doesn't matter at all  
Another shipwreck, another heartbreak  
Another shipwreck, I understand that  
I may never see home again  
Another shipwreck, another earthquake  
Another shipwreck, I understand  
It's time to admit  
Despite our endeavors  
Can't find whatever we lost  
Another shipwreck, another heartbreak  
Another shipwreck, I understand that  
I may never see home again  
Another shipwreck, another heartbreak  
Another shipwreck, I understand that  
I may never see home again  
Another shipwreck, another heartbreak  
Another shipwreck, I understand that  
I may never see home  
I may never see home  
I may never see home again  
I woke this morning in a different disguise  
(Another shipwreck)  
I cracked a mirror as I opened your letter  
(Another shipwreck)  
Scared to lose you but knowing the magic  
(Another shipwreck)  
I hear you every day, I meet you at night  
(Another shipwreck)  
Shipwreck  
Shipwreck  

There's a grandfather clock in the corner  
With a smile on it's face  
Chairs and tables, expensive labels  
Velvet curtains and lace  
Every day when I go in there  
I will buy a thing or two  
But money can't buy everything  
'Cos what I really want is you  
  
Oh, Antique Angelique, you mean more to me  
Than everything I have  
Oh, Antique Angelique, you mean more to me  
Than everything I have  
  
Now my house is an empty garden  
And the shop is so bare  
All these things that I bought mean nothing  
'Cos Angelique is still there  
It's too late now to forget her  
She means far too much to ignore  
Now I'm haunted with memories  
That I just can't stand anymore  
  
Oh, Antique Angelique, you mean more to me  
Than everything I have  
Oh, Antique Angelique, you mean more to me  
Than everything I have  
  
Take back the table, the velvet and lace  
The chairs, and the clock with the smile on it's face  
Take them all and stand them where they were before  
  
Antique Angelique, you mean more to me  
Than everything I have  
Oh, Antique Angelique, close the door, and now  
You're everything I have  
Antique Angelique, you mean more to me  
Than everything I have  
Antique Angelique......

You never seem, seem to have the time to listen to what I say  
How can I know just what goes on in your mind if you always walk away  
So what's the good, what's the good of trying  
And hanging around you begging for your love  
When it seems there's someone else in your dreams  
And I can't be sure of you anymore  
  
Are you growing tired of my love?  
Have you had too much of my love?  
Are you growing tired of my love?  
Where is the love you once gave me?  
  
And when we meet, things are not the same now, you always hurry away  
And all the friends that once you used to share with me are ignored now, and
you're bored now  
I guess we are through, but still I go on hoping  
Because you never put it into words  
Can't you see you should be honest with me  
And I've got to find what is in your mind  
  
Are you growing tired of my love?  
Have you had too much of my love?  
Are you growing tired of my love?  
Where is the love you once gave me?  
  
Are you growing tired of my love?  
Have you had too much of my love?  
Are you growing tired of my love?  
Where is the love you once gave me?  
  
Are you growing tired of my love?  
Have you had too much of my love?  
Are you growing tired of my love?  
Where is the love you once gave me?

Sitting here with Auntie Nelly, she is so alone  
Talking idly, she's in no hurry, I wish I could go  
But how could I just say Goodbye, there's no-one who she knows  
  
No I can't leave my Auntie Nellie, no  
No I can't leave my Auntie Nellie, no  
  
She's getting old and weary, oh it's such a shame  
'Cause she's been good to everyone but now they don't know her name  
  
No I can't leave my Auntie Nellie, no  
No I can't leave my Auntie Nellie, no  
  
Sitting here with Auntie Nelly, she is so alone  
Talking idly, she's in no hurry, I wish I could go  
But how could I just say Goodbye, there's no-one who she knows  
  
No I can't leave my Auntie Nellie, no  
She's so alone, she'd die if I should go  
No I can't leave my Auntie Nellie, no  
She's so alone...

When I was a little baby boy  
Just to sit and play would be my joy  
Now I'm oh so big and I'm oh so strong  
How I wish to be where I once belonged  
  
When I was an older baby boy  
All the girls I wanted were my joy  
I would drink my wine, wouldn't miss a night  
How I wish that someone had put me right  
When I was an older boy  
When I was an older boy  
When I was an older boy  
  
When I was an older lady's toy  
Thoughts of lust and wealth were now my joy  
And the years gone by are so far behind  
But the memories are still in my mind  
When I was a lady's boy  
When I was a lady's boy  
When I was a lady's boy  
  
When I was a little baby boy  
Just to sit and play would be my joy  
Now I'm oh so big and I'm oh so strong  
How I wish to be where I once belonged  
When I was a baby boy  
When I was a baby boy  
When I was a baby boy

I'm back on my feet again I'm flying high  
Watching my back again or I could die  
When we're up there flying  
And it all seems fine  
Half the time we're trying  
Trying hard what a fool  
Saying anything to raze it all  
But I'm back on my feet again I'm flying high  
Watching my back again or I could die  
It is down to timing  
Get it right first time  
'cause it's so exiting  
Keeping on with the flow  
Giving everybody such a show  
But I'm back on my feet again I'm flying high  
Watching my back again or I could die  
Out on the street again I'm riding high  
Worried 'bout anything that passes by  
It's not a nightmare or a dream  
It's not the first time that it's been  
I'm back on my feet again I'm flying high  
Watching my back again or I could die  
So it's time to work out  
What is going on  
So you'd best not freak out  
Lose your mind lose your cool  
It's the quickest way to end it all  
But I'm back on my feet again I'm flying high  
Watching my back again or I could die  
Out on the street again I'm riding high  
Worried 'bout anything that passes by  
Back on my feet again I'm flying high  
Watching my back again or I could die  

Down at Backwater junction rolling down the line  
In the dark early morning I heard the one-forty-nine  
I was walking down the highway, needed somewhere to go  
A lady laid beside me and she invited me home  
She led me cold, tired and hungry down the backwater road  
  
In a house on the corner looking over the track  
I woke up with a fever and a pain in my back  
She was lying there beside me, my fever started to grow  
Had a funny feeling but the lady said no  
My lover needs a doctor down the Backwater Road  
  
Whatcha lookin' for, whatcha lookin' for  
Lady do you know what cha' lookin' for  
Was I wrong to play along?  
Lady was I right or lady was I wrong?  
  
Backwater doctor, you've got me breathing in time  
It's ten-thirty in the morning and I'm feeling alright  
I went back to my lady but I wasn't to know  
Lady left this morning and she's not coming home  
I was cold when she left me down the Backwater Road  
  
I am just a poor man, got nowhere to go  
All my leaves have fallen, left me all alone  
If I was a rich man, if I was a king  
I would give you all I have, give you everything  
If you'd just take me, just take me now  
If you'd just take me  
  
Never seen my daddy, died when I was two  
Mama did the best she could, taught me all she knew  
Said that love was everything, tears came to her eyes  
Never knew the meaning, now I realise  
Love is all you need, all you need now  
If you just take me  
  
I'm trying hard to get you, I'm not the only one  
Never had a big car, but I'm not on the run  
If love has got a meaning see it in my eyes  
If you see the beginning, then you'd realise  
Love is all you need, all you

Say you need me, say you need me  
Tell me that you want my love  
Say you will be mine and I am yours  
You think that you're way above me  
I'm telling you that I can see  
All those things that you might wanna be  
I am yours tonight  
You be mine tonight  
  
You keep telling me you're not having me  
I'm telling you that I can see  
All the things that you might wanna be  
Say you need me, say you need me  
Tell me that you want my love  
Say will be mine and I am yours  
I am yours tonight  
You be mine tonight  
  
I got a big fat Mama  
With a big fat boy  
Really thinks she's something else  
But I love that woman  
Like fish loves the water  
And there is nobody else  
I'm gonna tell you woman better do as you're told  
If you don't, I'm gonna bring you down  
I've got a big fat Mama  
And there's no one else around  
  
I said say you need me  
Come on and say you need me  
I said say you need me  
  
Say you need me  
Come on and say you need me  
I said say you need me

I know where I'm heading for  
I know what I wanna be  
When they asked me at school what I wanted to be  
That was all they got from me  
  
I wanna be a big man, nobody putting me down  
I wanna be a big man  
  
They say love is all you need  
But everyone needs to know  
If you look a bit tough when you talk about love  
I'm sure that love would grow  
  
I wanna be a big man, nobody putting me down  
I wanna be a big man, yeah yeah  
  
Look around, see if I'm wrong  
It's only a show for those who don't belong  
  
I wanna be a big man, yeah yeah  
I wanna be a big man, yeah yeah  
  
I know what I'm living for  
But there ain't no guarantee  
If I make a wrong move you could jump in my shoes  
And that ain't no good to me  
  
I wanna be a big man, yeah yeah  
I wanna be a big man, yeah yeah  

When I get old and find the time  
I'll paint a picture about my life  
I'll paint it blue for you, I'll paint it blue for you  
You gave me love, a love so strong  
I treated you so bad, I treated you wrong  
Now I want to show, I feel so low, I'm blue for you  
  
When I was younger I tried so hard  
To find a good woman and give her my love  
I found a woman sweet as can be, I found a woman for me  
I didn't know I had the world  
I was still looking for ways to your love  
Now that I know, I feel so low, I'm blue for you  
  
Cheatin' and lyin', I played around  
Livin' and dyin', you stood your ground  
Cheatin' and lyin', you knew so well  
There's no good denying, you know me too well  
  
When I'm alone I realize  
Your eyes were smilin' but deep inside  
I saw the blue in you, everything blue for you  
You gave me love, a love so strong  
I treated you so bad, I treated you wrong  
Now I want to show, I feel so low, I'm blue for you  
Feel so low, I'm blue for you  
I feel so low I'm blue for you

Get your motor runnin'  
Head out on the highway  
Lookin' for adventure  
And whatever comes our way  
Yeah darlin', go make it happen  
Take the world in a love embrace  
Fire all of your guns at once  
And explode into space  
  
I like smoke and lightning  
Heavy metal thunder  
Racin' with the wind  
And the feelin' that I'm under  
Yeah Darlin' gonna make it happen  
Take the world in a love embrace  
Fire all of your guns at once  
And explode into space  
  
Like a true nature's child  
We were born, born to be wild  
We can climb so high  
I never want to die  
  
Born to be wild  
Born to be wild  
  
Get your motor runnin'  
Head out on the highway  
Lookin' for adventure  
And whatever comes our way  
Yeah darlin', gonna make it happen  
Take the world in a love embrace  
Fire all of your guns at once  
And explode into space  
  
I like smoke and lightning  
Heavy metal thunder  
Racin' with the wind  
And the feelin' that I'm under  
Yeah Darlin' go make it happen  
Take the world in a love embrace  
Fire all of your guns at once  
And explode into space  
  
Like a true nature's child  
We were born, born to be wild  
We can climb so high  
I never want to die  
  
Born to be wild  
Born to be wild

Spent a long, long evening in a low down honky-tonk bar  
Pulled a low down lady with a long black honky-tonk car  
I asked no questions, I got no lies  
A one off winner, I didn't want any ties  
And I knew it wasn't right  
Well, everybody has to sometimes break the rules  
Took me down on the highway doing too many miles an hour  
And by the way she motored thought we might have made the Eiffel Tower  
She stopped the motor by her own front door  
I knew she'd done it so many times before  
But I was off of the floor  
But everybody has to sometimes break the rules  
I woke up next morning feeling kind of up and down  
'Cos I did not know if I was in or out of the town  
Then I saw the face from the night before  
My purse was empty lying there on the floor  
But like I told you before  
That, everybody has to sometimes break the rules  
I spend a low down evening sitting high on a honky-tonk stool  
And I spent my money like a low down honky-tonk fool  
But everybody has to sometimes break the rules  
Well, everybody has to sometimes break the rules  
Yes, everybody has to sometimes break the rules  

Me and my friends gonna make a pile of money  
Gonna check it out every day  
Me and my wife gonna need every penny  
'Cause we're throwing it all away  
  
But I'm changing my tune  
And I'm breaking away  
  
Me and my friends we're rugged little rockers  
And we're lazing away the day  
Hot wax jacked-up on the television  
And forgetting about the pay  
  
But I'm changing my tune  
And I'm breaking away  
Breaking away  
  
Four rockers rollin'  
With a poet in the wings  
Waiting to blow his heart away  
Beanos with the road-crew  
Postcards to the wife  
Stating the menu of the day  
Flying through 'til breakfast  
Sleeping on the plane  
Looking a good deal  
Better than we'll ever feel again  
  
Is it really worth it?  
Could it all be real?  
Am I just living out a dream?  
Sitting in a hotel  
Falling of the stage  
Tuning in to Wonga Queen  
Old men in boys' clothes  
Has gone beyond a joke  
Skin me another  
And pass along the Wiskey and the Coke  
  
Me and my friends are hating everybody  
Who was telling us what to say  
Heads down rockin' on up and down the country only  
Living from day to day  
  
And I'm changing my tune  
And I'm breaking away  
Breaking away

If you ever change your mind  
About leaving, leaving me behind  
Oh-oh, bring it to me, bring your sweet loving  
Bring it on home to me, yeah  
You know I laughed when you left  
But now I know I only hurt myself  
Oh-oh, bring it to me, bring your sweet loving  
Bring it on home to me, yeah, yeah, yeah  
I'll give you jewelery, money too  
And that's not all, all I'll do for you  
Oh-oh, bring it to me, bring your sweet loving  
Bring it on home to me, yeah, yeah, yeah  
You know I'll always be your slave  
'Til I'm dead and buried in my grave  
Oh-oh, bring it to me, bring your sweet loving  
Bring it on home to me, yeah, yeah, yeah  
If you ever change your mind  
About leaving, leaving me behind  
Oh-oh, bring it to me, bring your sweet loving  
Bring it on home to me, yeah  
Bring your sweet loving, bring it on home to me, yeah  
Bring your sweet loving, bring it on home to me, yeah  
Bring your sweet loving, bring it on home to me, yeah  
Bring your sweet loving, bring it on home to me, yeah  
Bring it on home to me  

Sitting by a broken window  
Up in a back room swallowing wine  
Gazing down a backstreet garden  
With my bed chair table and wine  
Looks like I'm going no where but no where's where I am  
Guess I'll always be a backstreet broken man  
Calling out my name and number  
As I was walking out of my cell  
Louie gave me back my wallet  
He nearly dropped my picture of Nell  
Drinking gets you nowhere but nowhere's where I am  
Guess I'll always be a backstreet broken man  
Oh broken man, oh yeah, broken man  
Early on a Sunday morning  
As I was walking on down the lane  
Someone said, I beg your pardon  
And I was sure I knew her name  
She was going somewhere but nowhere's where I ran  
Guess I'll always be a backstreet broken man  
Oh that's where I am, guess I'll always be a backstreet broken man

She drew out all her money out of the Southern Trust  
And put her little boy aboard a Greyhound Bus  
Leaving Louisiana for the Golden West  
Down came the tears from her happiness  
Her own little son name 'o Johnny B. Goode  
Was gonna made some motion pictures out in Hollywood  
Bye, bye, bye, bye  
Bye, bye, bye, bye  
Bye bye Johnny  
Good bye Johnny B. Goode  
She remembered taking money out from the gathering crop  
And buying Johnny's guitar at a broker shop  
As long as he would play it by the railroad side  
And wouldn't get in trouble he was satisfied  
But never thought that there would come a day like this  
When she would have to give her son a goodbye kiss  
Going  
Bye, bye, bye, bye  
Bye, bye, bye, bye  
Bye bye Johnny  
Good bye Johnny B. Goode  
She finally got the letter she was dreaming of  
Johnny wrote and told her he had felt in love  
As soon as he was married he would bring her back  
And build a mension for 'em by the railroad track  
So every time they heard the locomotive roar  
They'd be a' standin', a' wavin' by the kitchen door  
Howling  
Bye, bye, bye, bye  
Bye, bye, bye, bye  
Bye bye Johnny  
Good bye Johnny B. Goode  

I've never been a loner  
Never been to California but I wanted to  
I thought it was dreams in my head  
I've never been a moaner  
But I'll get to Arizona if it kills me to  
I wish I could fly from my bed  
  
And it's calling me over  
And it's calling me home  
Let's talk it over  
I'm calling, calling, crawling, crawling  
Rolling me over  
And it's rolling me home  
I'm glad all over  
It's calling, calling, I'm crawling my way home  
  
I wrote a little letter  
But it didn't make it better, I was aiming to  
But you read it wrong, what I said  
Hold on, it doesn't matter  
What was written in the letter and I'm telling you  
It's not just some dream in my head  
  
And it's calling me over  
And it's calling me home  
Let's talk it over  
I'm calling, calling, crawling, crawling  
Rolling me over  
And it's rolling me home  
I'm glad all over  
It's calling, calling, I'm crawling my way home  
  
I could always go along without you  
You know I could do it alone and I would  
'Cause I'm a prima donna, gonna go ahead  
I'm gonna, gonna get my own way if I can  
  
And it keeps calling me over  
And it's calling me home  
Let's talk it over  
I'm calling, calling, crawling, crawling  
Rolling me over  
And it's rolling me home  
I'm glad all over  
It's calling, calling, I'm crawling, crawling

She won't drink and she won't swear  
You can't take her anywhere at all  
She got style but she don't care  
She left me beyond repair before  
She'll pass you by, boy  
She'll try you and tie you in knots  
Run for cover  
'Cos brother, she's calling the shots  
Falling in and falling out  
When you know what she's about you're fine  
You lost both swings and roundabouts  
Can't you see you're running out of time?  
She'll pass you by, boy  
She'll try you and tie you in knots  
Run for cover  
'Cos brother, she's calling the shots  
She'll make you cry  
Wave bye bye as she takes what you've got  
Booked another  
And lover's still calling the shots  
She'll pass you by, boy  
She'll try you and tie you in knots  
Run for cover  
'Cos brother, she's calling the shots  
She'll pass you by, boy  
She'll try you and tie you in knots  
Run for cover  
'Cos brother, she's calling the shots

Now you know this ain't the kind of life for you  
It's not the way you thought that it would be  
If I could change my way to you  
If I could change, it wouldn't be me  
And you see  
  
I know I never tried the things I should have done  
Oh and time is always passing by  
I want to do the things I never done before  
So I do try not to tell a lie  
When I'm so low, when I'm so high  
Yet you cry when I say I can't give you more  
  
First you said you'd never try to slow me down  
That ev'rything would work out really fine  
But as those walls closed in on us  
Your words just fell right out of line  
And behind  
  
I know I never tried the things I should have done  
And time is always passing by  
I want to do the things I never done before  
So I do try not to tell a lie  
When I'm so low, when I'm so high  
Yet you cry when I say I can't give you more  
  
Oh, oh, oh, can't give you more  
Can't give any more  
Oh, oh, oh, can't give you more  
Ain't got any more  
  
Did you figure ours would be an easy thing  
Like lazy days of lying in the sun  
I told you if you wanted me  
That ev'ry day just wouldn't be fun  
Now it's done  
  
I know I never tried the thing I should have done  
And time is always passing by  
I want to do the things I never done before  
So I do try not to tell a lie  
When I'm so low, when I'm so high  
Yet you cry when I say I can't give you more  
  
Oh, oh, oh, can't give you more  
Can't give you more  
Oh, oh, oh, can't give you more  
I ain't got any more  
Oh, oh, oh, I ain't got any more  
I ain't got any more  
Oh, oh, oh, can't give you more  
I ain't got any more

I got a brand new baby and I feel so good  
She loves even better than I thought she would  
I'm on my way to her house and I'm plumb outta breath  
And when I see her tonight I'm gonna squeeze her to death  
Claudette, pretty little pet, Claudette  
Never make me fret Claudette  
She's the greatest little girl that I've ever met  
I get the best lovin' that I'll ever get from Claudette  
Oh oh, Claudette  
Well, I'm a lucky man my baby treats me right  
She's gonna let me hug and kiss an hold her tight  
And when the date is over and were at her front door  
When I kiss her good night, I'll holler more, more, more  
Claudette, pretty little pet, Claudette  
Never make me fret Claudette  
She's the greatest little girl that I've ever met  
I get the best lovin' that I'll ever get from Claudette  
Oh oh, Claudette, oh oh, Claudette  
When me an my new baby have a date or three  
I'm gonna ask my baby if she'll marry me  
I'm gonna be so happy for the rest of my life  
When my brand new baby is my brand new wife  
Claudette, pretty little pet, Claudette  
Never make me fret Claudette  
She's the greatest little girl that I've ever met  
I get the best lovin' that I'll ever get from Claudette  
Oh oh, Claudette, oh oh Claudette  
She's the greatest little girl that I've ever met  
I get the best lovin' that I'll ever get from Claudette  
Oh oh, Claudette, oh oh, Claudette  

It's so long since I sang songs to you  
I forget all the words I once knew  
I could look back  
But I can't waste the time  
  
Did it matter  
They sometimes didn't rhyme  
It's so long since I sang songs for you  
  
It's so long since you smile just for me  
Now your smile's just an old use to be  
Does it matter  
That I can take the time  
  
Would you rather  
I write you one more line  
Can my songs once again be for you  
  
Claudie made a fool out of me  
Made me find another place to be  
I've been living alone  
In a house that wasn't my home  
With Claudie is the place I want to be  
  
When I left did you think of me crying  
Did you care that I felt I was dying  
I pretended  
That I don't give a damn  
All along  
I've know what I really am  
I'm a fool little Claudie just for you  
  
Claudie made a fool out of me  
Made me find another place to be  
I've been living alone  
In a house that wasn't my home  
With Claudie is the place I want to be

I like the way you walk  
You got a giggle when you talk  
I like the way you talk  
You got a wiggle when you walk  
Nothing you can do, sure as one and one is two  
I'll be creepin' up on you.  
  
I'm gonna be your man  
You'd better understand  
Be your pretty little thing  
Your puppet on a string  
Nothing you can do, sure as one and one is two  
I'll be creepin' up on you  
  
Gonna write a little letter  
Poetry for two  
Send you pretty flowers  
Creepin' up on you  
  
Gonna write a little letter  
Poetry for two  
Send you pretty flowers  
  
Gonna take a little time  
Before I make you mine  
But I'll bet you anything  
You're gonna wear my ring  
Nothing you can do  
Sure as one and one is two  
I'll be creepin' up on you  
  
Nothing you can do, sure as one and one is two  
I'll be creepin' up on you  
  
Nothing you can do, sure as one and one is two  
I'll be creepin' up on you

I wasn't born in a lap deluxe  
I didn't have no silver spoon  
We all dream 'bout mega bucks  
Like wishing for the moon  
They say money just buys you problems  
Bigger taxes, jealousy  
Big decisions on what to do with it all  
That's the kind of problem I mean  
I would cross that bridge when I come to it  
When I come to it  
I wanna get to it  
Gonna cross that bridge when I come to it  
Maybe just around the bend  
Then I'm gonna burn that bridge other side of it  
Other side of it  
Greener side of it  
Gonna burn that bridge other side of it  
'cause I'll never wanna go back there  
I thought I'd been in love  
But it's a feeling I can't trust  
'cause nine times out of nine I find  
I've been head over heels in lust  
Married man say, love's nothing but trouble  
Like it's some kind of terminal disease  
They say love's strange, love is blind, love hurts  
Well, that's the kind of trouble I need  
I would cross that bridge when I come to it  
When I come to it  
I wanna get to it  
Gonna cross that bridge when I come to it  
Maybe just around the bend  
I said never, never, never, never - never  
Never come back again - no  
Never come back again  
They say money can't buy you happiness  
And that true love never runs smooth  
They talk of the trouble, and the strife they bring  
Well I don't care, 'cause here's what I would do  
I would cross that bridge when I come to it  
When I come to it  
I wanna get to it  
Gonna cross that bridge when I come to it  
Maybe just around the bend  
Then I'm gonna burn that bridge other side of it  
Other side of it  
Greener side of it  
Gonna burn that bridge other side of it  
'cause I'll never wanna go back there  
I said never, never, never, never - never  
Never come back again - no  
Never come back again  

You and I can see what's going wrong  
We know we don't like it going wrong  
Daughter can you have sons for yourself  
Daughter can you have some for yourself  
  
All your whiskered friends their wings and life  
Who knows what 'o' ever reason why  
Daughter can you have sons for yourself  
Daughter can you have some for yourself  
  
Listen to the sounds of lowry pride  
Seen her in the truth within her life  
Daughter can you have sons for yourself  
Daughter can you have some for yourself  

She's got to run, she's got to hide  
She's got her head stuck in a sand dune  
She never thinks, she never tries  
She doesn't see that she's gonna pull through  
  
She used to laugh, she used to cry  
She used to play hot as the others  
She used to fool, she used to fight  
She loved a wind-up on a Saturday night  
  
Don't you break down, dead in the water  
Don't you leave town now, though you want to  
Don't you break down, dead in the water  
Dead in the water  
  
He is the one, he has the smile  
Keeping his cool across the dance floor  
He moves around, he moves away  
They move together the rest of the night  
  
He hits the spot, she fits the bill  
He tries it on, maybe she wants to  
He books a room, a takeaway  
Is this the answer to all of their problems?  
  
Don't you break down, dead in the water  
Don't you leave town now, though you want to  
Don't you break down, down in the water  
  
The longest day must end, but that's another time  
Perhaps another life, we may be here again  
The longest day must end, we take it as we find  
But if we never try we may be here again  
  
The longest day must end, we take it as we find  
But if we never try we may be here again  
  
She's waking up, she's in a dream  
The world is gone, left her to wonder  
Did it begin? When will it end?  
She can't believe that it didn't come true  
  
She needs to laugh, she needs to cry  
She needs to play hot as the others  
She used to fool, she used to fight  
She loved a wind-up on a Saturday night  
  
Don't you break down dead in the water  
Don't you leave town now though you want to  
Don't you break down  
Dead in the water  
Dead in the water

Everybody was talking to me  
Like I was a child  
In their words I could hear them saying  
It's just a matter of time  
Anyway it's a long long race been run  
Anyway it's a sad sad song been sung  
  
Dear John goodbye she said  
Sometimes it's hard she said  
Dear John I've broken away  
  
Vanity is hard old lady  
You can't read her mind  
I'm a fool but I don't fool easy  
While you're foolin' around  
Anyway I can hold my own tonight  
I admit I was wrong and you where right  
  
Dear John Goodbye she said  
Sometimes it's hard she said  
Dear John I've broken away  
  
Dear John goodbye she said  
Sometimes it's hard she said  
Dear John I've broken away  
  
Dear John goodbye she said  
Sometimes it's hard she said  
Dear John I've broken away  
  
Everybody was talking to me  
Like I was a child  
In their words I could hear them saying  
It's just a matter of time  
Anyway it's a long long race been run  
Anyway it's a sad sad song been sung  
  
Dear John goodbye she said  
Sometimes it's hard she said  
Dear John I've broken away  
  
Dear John goodbye she said  
Sometimes it's hard she said  
Dear John I've broken away  
  
Dear John goodbye she said  
Sometimes..

If you ever found anything better than working  
You'd want to do it again  
Like flying a plane or nude body surfing  
You'd want to do it again  
That Casanova he had it right  
He'd just do it again  
He'd do it again all day and all night  
Then he'd do it again  
  
You gonna drink too much say never no more  
But you're gonna do it again  
Trust me I'm a doctor I know for sure  
You're gonna do it again  
  
Do it again, do it again  
If you all like it do it again  
Do it again, do it again  
If it hits you right just do it again  
  
Me I get time off I twiddle my thumbs  
'cause I want to do it again  
I get a rush every night when 8.45 comes  
Can't wait to do it again  
There is a price to pay, it ain't cheap  
If you want to do it again  
But I sold my soul yeah I'm in deep  
Might as well do it again  
  
Life is short, never complain  
You could be hit by a truck, fall under a train  
Enjoying yourself is the name of the game  
Gotta go back tonight and do it again  
  
Do it again, do it again  
If you all like it do it again  
Do it again, do it again  
If it hits you right just do it again  
  
That Mona Lisa now she could smile  
And do it again  
She'd sit and grin for quite a while  
Then she'd do it again  
You is here then you ain't, that was never in doubt  
Better do it again  
Don't take no Einstein to work it out  
So do it again  
  
Do it again, do it again  
If you all like it do it again  
Do it again, do it again  
If it hits you right just do it again  
Do it again, do it again  
If you all like it do it again  
Do it again, do it again  
If it hits you right just do it again

Riding on a big white butterfly  
I turned my back away towards the sky  
I closed my eyes to look for something  
Saw myself as really nothing  
Then I realised my butterfly  
Wasn't really up there with me  
We all make mistakes, forgive me  
Would you like to ride my butterfly  
  
Riding on a long blue paperplane  
Getting seasick, sorry once again  
Landing strip is getting nearer  
Hope the foglifts, make it clearer  
Then I realised my paperplane  
Wasn't really up there with me  
We all make mistakes, forgive me  
Would you like to ride my paperplane  
  
Riding in a three grand Deutche car  
A to B is often very far  
Home is near, but such a long way  
Legs and heads all feel the wrong way  
Then I realised my Deutche car  
Is only there to get me somewhere  
Even so I really do care  
Would you like to ride my Deutche car

Don't mind if I do, don't mind if I  
Don't care much at all, can't think that much  
I'm climbing the walls, losing my touch  
You don't give a damn  
  
When you are out there on your own  
Saying you can't find your way home  
Do you think you know what is real?  
And do you know what you want from me?  
I'm being the best that I can be  
Now I know nothing feels the same  
  
Don't mind if I do, don't mind if I  
Don't care much at all, can't think that much  
I'm climbing the walls, losing my touch  
I'm all in a jam  
I don't lie to you, I don't need to  
I won't cry for you, I don't feel to  
Don't you cry to me, I've seen through you  
You don't give a damn  
  
Can I be honest with you now?  
I'm feeling a fool again somehow  
Maybe I should be moving on.  
  
Don't mind if I do, don't mind if I  
Don't care much at all, can't think that much  
I'm climbing the walls, losing my touch  
I'm all in a jam  
I don't lie to you, I don't need to  
I won't cry for you, I don't feel to  
Don't you cry to me, I've seen through you  
You don't give a damn  
  
Take it or leave it seems to be  
The only way open left for me  
Should I be feeling how I feel?  
  
Don't mind if I do, don't mind if I  
Don't care much at all, can't think that much  
I'm climbing the walls, losing my touch  
I'm all in a jam  
I don't lie to you, I don't need to  
I won't cry for you, I don't feel to  
Don't you cry to me, I've seen through you  
You don't give a damn  
  

If you wake up and don't wanna smile  
If it takes just a little while  
Open your eyes, look at the day  
You'll see things in a different way  
  
Don't stop thinking about tomorrow  
Don't stop, it'll soon be here  
It'll be here better than before  
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone  
  
Why not think about the times to come  
And not about the things that you've done  
If your life was bad to you  
Just think what tomorrow will do  
  
Don't stop thinking about tomorrow  
Don't stop, it'll soon be here  
It'll be here better than before  
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone  
  
All I want is to see you smile  
If it takes just a luttle while  
I know you don't beieve that it's true  
I didn't mean any harm to you  
  
Don't stop thinking about tomorrow  
Don't stop, it'll soon be here  
It'll be here better than before  
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone  
  
Don't stop thinking about tomorrow  
Don't stop, it'll soon be here  
It'll be here better than before  
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone  
  
Oooh, don't you look back

Oh baby please, I'm on my knees  
Oh baby please don't stop me now  
Oh baby please don't stop me now  
  
I scheme all night and I dream all day  
I'm so paranoid someone's gonna take you away  
You look surprised and I'm so amazed  
But don't let true love fade away  
  
I see your face and I hear your name  
Give me one chance and no-one's gonna take you away  
You look surprised and I'm so amazed  
But don't let true love fade away  
  
Oh baby please, I'm on my knees  
Oh baby please don't stop me now  
Oh baby please, it's always been a dream  
If it's really me don't stop me now  
Oh baby please don't stop me now  
  
You look surprised and I'm so amazed  
But don't let true love fade away  
You look surprised and I'm so amazed  
But don't let true love fade away

Maybe I'm right, or maybe I'm wrong  
I got to go on anyway  
I'm finding it hard to try and play the right card  
And woman you're getting in my way  
Oh, you don't think it matters at all  
No, you don't think it matters at all  
No, you don't think it matters at all  
  
I'm working all night, you know I'm working all night  
Trying to get something out of my head  
I live for the day when everybody will say  
It's better than all of the rest  
Oh, you don't think it matters at all  
No, you don't think it matters at all  
No, you don't think it matters at all  
  
Maybe I'm right, or maybe I'm wrong  
I just do the best that I can  
I been working all night, yeah I work through the night  
Woman can't you understand?  
  
Oh, you don't think it matters at all  
No, you don't think it matters at all  
No, you don't think it matters at all

You spend my money  
You drink my best red wine  
You think it's funny  
To see me all the time  
Sitting with my head hanging down  
Treating me just like a clown  
You spend my money  
But come on honey don't waste my time  
  
When you get older  
You'll see what you have done  
You hung on my shoulder  
And loved me just for fun  
But some day when I'm older too  
I'm gonna come and make fool out of you  
You spend my money  
And honey  
You sure did waste my time  
  
You spend my money  
You drink my best red wine  
You think it's funny  
To see me all the time  
Sitting with my head hanging down  
Treating me like a clown  
You spend my money  
Come on honey don't waste my time

I heard you cry tonight while you were sleeping tight  
What were you dreamin'?  
Was it another guy and did he make you cry  
While you were dreamin'?  
I don't find it easy to say  
But I think it's right that you have to know  
  
Why won't you understand you're being underhand  
About your dreamin'?  
I love you more and more, of that you can be sure,  
Even your dreamin'.  
I don't mind if you just say  
You dream of us both but I have to know  
You've got to understand you're being underhand about your dreamin'  
  
Dreams, dreams, dreams, some are never long enough  
Dreams, dreams, dreams, some are never good enough  
I wonder do, do, do you ever get to sleep at night?  
Who, who, who is it gonna be tonight?  
  
You've been a naughty girl, you've got me in a whirl  
I do believe it  
You know you can be sure I want you more and more  
Can you believe it?  
I don't find it easy to say  
But I think it's right that you have to know  
You've been a naughty girl, you've got me in a whirl  
I do believe it  
You are a naughty girl, you've got me in a whirl  
Can you believe it?  
You've been a naughty girl, you've got me in a whirl  
About your dreamin'  
About your dreamin'  
About your dreamin'

You can't see what you mean to me  
I just can't get you out of my head  
You move me more than I've ever been  
Like a wild supersonic jet  
But I can't see your love drifting away  
And I don't want your love d-d-d-drifting away  
  
I got told by a friend of mine  
That you don't want me anymore  
Now my friend's got a broken nose  
Sure, and I got a broken jaw  
So don't push me around, I'm coming your way  
And I don't want your love d-d-d-drifting away  
  
Don't you know what I'm living for?  
Don't you know what I'm trying to say?  
Don't try to shove me outta that door  
'Cause you're mine and it's staying that way  
I'm giving you my love, don't throw it away  
But I can see your love d-d-d-drifting away  
Oh, drifting away, you got me drifting away  
Oh, drifting away

I'm gonna ease your mind, I'm gonna write a line  
And write a letter to you  
I'm gonna let you know that I'll be coming home  
And make it better with you  
I sang a sad lullaby  
I left you all alone to cry  
Well I need you, oh my  
Just to sing a lullaby  
It won't be very long before I right my wrongs  
And make it better with you  
It's such a crying shame I had to break away  
To find the same old road  
But now I'm getting wise, and I've realized  
That that's a the way that it goes  
So put a smile upon your face  
Let me know I've found my place  
We've got no time to waste  
'Cos all the time for heaven's late  
Now don't you be afraid, it's gonna be the same  
I'll make it better with you  
I'm gonna ease your mind, I'm gonna write a line  
And write a letter to you  
I'm gonna let you know that I'll be coming home  
And make it better with you  
I sang a sad lullaby  
I left you all alone to cry  
Well I need you, oh my  
Just to sing a lullaby  
It won't be very long before I right my wrongs  
And make it better with you

I have been there  
I've been seen there  
And I keep going on  
Telling anyone  
Who'll keep hanging on  
That I don't mind at all  
  
Electric Arena  
Wired for sound  
End of the alleyway  
Back end of any town  
Electric Arena  
I loved you so  
Taught me the kind of things  
My mama should never know  
  
Ooh my memory  
Always takes me  
Back to way back when  
Things were happening  
Always happening  
All because of you  
  
Electric Arena  
Wired for sound  
End of the alleyways  
Back end of any town  
Electric Arena  
I loved you so  
Taught me the kind of things  
My mama should never know  
  
When I'm feeling blue  
I sometimes think of you  
Then I'm feeling so much better  
  
I'm wondering  
Was it better then  
Or is it all the same  
Was it happening  
And still happening  
All because of you  
  
Electric Arena  
Wired for sound  
End of the alleyways  
Back end of any town  
Electric Arena  
I loved you so  
Taught me the kind of things  
My mama should never know

There's nobody on the end of my line  
I'm in time but somebody's missing  
Maybe I can find a hand for my hand  
If I find a well for my wishing  
Be my friend, be my friend  
  
It gets lonely on a table for two  
Laughing on your own can be no fun  
Even people that are talking to you  
Remind you that you're really with no-one  
Be my friend, be my friend  
  
Take me over like a thing from the past  
Lots of people wishing they'd been there  
No-one knowing just how long it would last  
But I'm sitting still here in my chair  
Be my friend, be my friend  
  
Forty-five hundred times I told you how much I care  
Forty-five hundred times I told you how much I care  
Problems halved are the problems that we can share  
White lies in our eyes, together not really there  
  
Forty-five hundred times I told you you can lean on me  
Forty-five hundred times I told you you can lean on me  
Though it's taken a long time for you to see  
Where we're at is the right place for us to be  
  
I sure want to stay here, it sure feels fine  
I feel I could be here a long long time  
Now that I've made it, I don't want to fade it  
Now that I've made it with you  
  
We came a long way, a slow way too  
Up from the down way and back to you  
Now that I've made it I don't want to fade it  
Now that I've made it with you

I got fat knees  
From crawlin' so fast

Anymore part of you  
I got brain pain  
You make me so mad

Anymore part of you  
Get out, get out

Stop blowing kisses  
Across the hall

I used to get mad at my school  
The teachers that taught me weren't cool  
Holding me down, and turning me round  
Filling me up with your rules  
  
Got to admit it's getting better  
It's getting better all the time  
Have to admit it's getting better  
It's getting better, since you'll be mine  
  
I used to be angry young man  
Me hiding me head in the sand  
You gave me the word, I finally heard  
I'm doing the best that I can  
  
Got to admit it's getting better  
It's getting better all the time  
Have to admit it's getting better

Getting so much better all the time  
  
It's getting better all the time, better, better, better  
It's getting better all the time, better, better, better  
  
I used to be cruel to my woman, I beat her  
And kept her apart from the things that she loved  
Man I was mean but I'm changing my scene  
And I'm doing the best that I can  
  
Got to admit it's getting better  
It's getting better all the time  
Have to admit it's getting better  
It's getting better, since you'll be mine  
Getting so much better all the time

I'm tired out, my head is aching  
I want to shout, but I feel I'm goin' nowhere  
Yeah, I feel I'm goin' nowhere  
I've run about in a fit of madness  
To work it out in the hope of goin' somewhere  
Yeah I hope I'm goin' somewhere  
  
And I know it must be time for me making up my mind  
Does it matter if I'm fine? It'll change my tune in time  
If I'm really goin' nowhere  
  
I'm better now, I've thought about it  
Can't figure out, but I'm looking for it somewhere  
All I know is that it's somewhere  
It's closer now than I've ever had it  
Much closer now, so I must be getting somewhere  
Yeah, I hope I'm getting somewhere  
  
'Cause you never know, in time with the changing of my mind  
I could turn around and say that was just another day  
Am I really goin' nowhere?  
  
I've run about in a fit of madness  
To work it out in the hope of goin' somewhere

How d'you know the music when you don't know the score  
Do you think that you can make it when you don't need no more  
Is it really the reason when it is not a need  
Are you trying hard to write it before you can read  
  
Hold you back, hold you back, and slow you down  
Hold you back, hold you back, slow you down  
Hold you back, hold you back, slow you down  
Slow you down, you've gotta try  
  
Does the clock that you're watching ever tell you 'bout the time  
Does the song that you're singing sound to you like a rhyme  
Will there be an answer when you stop asking why  
All because of the jigsaw that makes up a lie  
  
Hold you back, hold you back, slow you down  
Hold you back, hold you back, slow you down  
Hold you back, hold you back, slow you down  
Slow you down, you've gotta try

She stole the bottle then she said  
Your eyes were blue and now they're red  
I think I'll carry you to bed  
I don't remember anymore  
  
I want to rock and roll, want to sell my soul  
Sail the tv round the swimming pool

She's the best girl that I ever had

You made me love you, now I can't say goodbye  
You're way above me, but I'll never know why  
When I turn left and then you turn right  
And you say you're right, and you're wrong  
I know you're wrong  
  
Oh, I saw the light in you  
There wasn't much that I could do  
Oh, I saw the light in you  
I saw the light  
  
You made me like you, and now like you I am  
I try to stay me, but I don't know if I can  
Oh, when I say it's black and you say it's white  
And I say it's black and you're wrong  
I know you're wrong  
  
'Cause I saw the light in you  
There wasn't much that I could do  
Oh, I saw the light in you  
I saw the light  
  
Standing on the platform watching all the trains go past  
Keep on trying to catch one but you know they're much too fast  
I never seem to make it but I know the reason why  
I need to, need to, need to, need to get away  
  
You made me love you, now I can't say goodbye  
You're way above me but I'll never know why  
Oh, when I say it's black and you say it's white  
And I say it's right and you're wrong  
I know you're wrong  
  
Oh, I saw the light in you  
There wasn't much that I could do  
Oh, I saw the light in you  
I saw the light  
Oh, I saw the light with you  
There wasn't much that I could do  
Oh, I saw the light in you  
I saw the light  
Oh, I saw the light in you...

I found out what I wanted, I found out when I needed to  
You thought me kind-a-hearted, I heard that when I wanted you  
Being wrong isn't easy, right's another way  
Being wrong isn't easy, right's another way  
  
A-when you want me, just think like you're ready to  
Like me when I want to, why me does it have to be?  
Everyone tried to tell me, right's another way  
Everyone tried to tell me, right's another way  
  
Trust me to fall apart, trust you to know  
Just you and no-one else, just me alone  
Why did it have to be? I should have known  
Oh I should have known  
  
I can't tell, did you mean it? Did you mean what I think you did?  
I won't give less you need it, just a bit could be overhead  
I won't wait for a minute, can't hesitate  
I won't wait for a minute, can't hesitate  
  
Trust me to fall apart, trust you to know  
Just you and no-one else, just me alone  
Why did it have to be? I should have known  
Oh I should have known

I, I who have nothing  
I, I who have no-one  
Adore you and want you so  
I'm just a no-one with nothing to give you, but oh  
I love you  
  
He'll, he'll buy you diamonds  
Bright sparkling diamonds  
But believe me, hear what I say  
That he can give you the world, but he'll never love you the way  
I love you  
  
He can take you any place you want  
To fancy clubs and restaurants  
But I can only watch you with  
My nose pressed up against the window pane  
Yeah, you know that you are loved  
  
But I, I who have nothing  
I, I who have no-one  
Must watch you go dancing by  
Wrapped in the arms of somebody else, when darling, 'tis I  
Who loves you  
  
I, I who have nothing  
I, I who have no-one  
Must watch you go dancing by  
Wrapped in the arms of somebody else, when darling,'tis I  
Who loves you  
  
(Spoken) I need you girl, I have nothing without you  
I love you girl, I am just nothing without you

A vacation in the foreign land  
Uncle Sam does the best he can  
You're in the army now  
Oh, oh, you're in the army, now  
  
Now you remember what the draft man said  
Nothing to do all day but stay in bed  
You're in the army now  
Oh, oh you're in the army, now  
  
You'll be a hero of the neighborhood  
Nobody knows that you left for good  
You're in the army now  
Oh, oh, you're in the army, now  
  
Smiling faces on the way to 'Nam  
But once you get there no one gives a damn  
You're in the army now  
Oh, oh, you're in the army, now  
  
Hand grenades flying over your head  
  
Missiles flying over your head  
If you want to survive, get out of bed  
You're in the army now  
Oh, oh, you're in the army, now  
  
Shots ring out in the dead of night  
The sergeant calls: "Stand up and fight!"  
You're in the army now  
Oh, oh you're in the army, now  
  
You've got your orders to shoot on sight  
Your finger's on the trigger but it don't seem right  
You're in the army now  
Oh, oh you're in the army, now  
  
Night is falling and you just can't see  
Is this illusion or reality  
You're in the army now  
Oh, oh you

Baby, the feeling that you give to me  
Maybe I'm thinking your so good to me  
Is it really, really me?  
Is it really, really me?  
  
Baby, the feeling, I can't stand the joy  
Spare me some feeling if I wake up a boy  
Is it really, really me?  
Is it really, really me?  
  
Baby, I'm feeling like a fire, I am  
Am I still teething or could I be a man?  
Is it? Is it?  
Is it really, really me?  
Is it really, really me?  
  
I gotta get along ''cause it's a long, long ride now  
I've been away too long, I gotta get on home now  
I'm getting far too old to know my dream of fortune  
But the time is flowing now, I know what I must do  
  
I gotta go home, I gotta go home  
I gotta go home to ease my mind  
I gotta go home, I gotta go home  
I gotta go home to ease my mind

I gotta go home, I gotta go home  
I gotta go home to ease my mind

Is there a better way

Or just another day  
  
Theres got to be a way  
To make a better day

To make a better day  
  
Youre never gonna be the one to hold me down

To fight another day

What's a boy to do, when fate is cruel?  
Keep on keepin' on try to bend the rules  
I'll do anything to find a way to your heart  
  
I got a rabbit's foot but luck don't come  
Got my fingers crossed and they go numb,  
I can hold my breath and wish for you  
I need a miracle to make it true  
  
Life is hard, I need a remedy  
For the way I feel  
My bread keeps landing jam side down  
Say you'll be there to spread love around  
  
I was sweet on you that's how I felt  
Got a butter heart, you made it melt  
Like a big eyed kid in a candy store  
I had a little sugar now I want some more  
  
Life is hard, I need a remedy  
For the way I feel  
My bread keeps landing jam side down  
Say you'll be there to spread love around  
  
My bread keeps landing jam side down  
Say you'll be there to spread love around  
  
You are my destiny you  
Bring out the best in me you  
You made me feel so lucky  
  
So lucky to have you  
And I need you  
Yeah I need you  
  
Life is hard, I need a remedy  
For the way I feel  
My bread keeps landing jam side down  
Say you'll be there to spread love around  
  
Life is hard, I need a remedy  
For the way I feel  
My bread keeps landing jam side down  
Say you'll be there to spread love around  
  
My bread keeps landing jam side down  
Say you'll be there to spread love around

Just jealousy, my jealousy  
Is what you see doing me  
Jealous of me, such jealousy  
It shouldn't be - leave me alone  
  
Time is running out, out runs the time  
I waste it on my own  
But don't think I'm alone  
Oh no, not again, I won't reply  
I can't stay on the phone  
I'll see you back at home  
I really did think that problem was solved  
But it is not  
  
Just jealousy, my jealousy  
Is what you see doing me  
Jealous of me, such jealousy  
It shouldn't be - leave me alone  
  
I've got another one, listen to me  
And don't get all hung on  
To things I have done wrong  
Oh no, not again, I won't reply  
It's only how I feel  
It sometimes seems unreal  
But everyone gets there once in a while  
Are you wishing?  
  
Just jealousy, my jealousy  
Is what you see doing me  
Jealous of me, such jealousy  
It shouldn't be - leave me alone  
Just jealousy, my jealousy  
Is what you see doing me  
Jealous of me, such jealousy  
It shouldn't be - leave me alone ....  

Love me baby, love me when I'm down  
I said love me baby, love me when I'm down  
Yeah you gotta love me baby  
'Cause there's no use hanging around  
  
I said put your arms around me like a sunbeam round the sun  
I said put your arms around me like a sunbeam round the sun  
Yeah, you gotta love me woman  
'Cause my life has just begun  
  
Love me baby, love me when I'm down  
Oh, love, love me baby, love me when I'm down  
Yeah you gotta love me baby  
'Cause there's no use hanging around  
  
Put your arms around me like a sunbeam round the sun  
I said, put your arms around me like a sunbeam round the sun  
You gotta love me woman  
'Cause my life has just begun  
  
Love me baby, love me when I'm down  
Oh, love, love, love me baby, love me when I'm down  
You gotta love me baby  
'Cause there's no use hanging around, around, around, yeah  
  
Love me baby, love me when I'm down  
Love me baby, love me when I'm down  
Oh you gotta love me baby  
'Cause there's no use hanging around

I am just a poor man, got nowhere to go  
All my leaves have fallen, left me all alone  
If I was a rich man, if I was a king  
I would give you all I have, give you everything  
  
If you'd just take me  
Just take me now  
If you'd just take me  
  
Never seen my daddy, died when I was two  
Mama did the best she could, taught me all she knew  
Said that love was everything, tears came to her eyes  
Never knew the meaning, now I realize  
  
[Chorus:]  
Love is all you need  
All you need now  
If you just take me  
  
I'm trying hard to get you, I'm not the only one  
Never had a big car, but I'm not on the run  
If love has got a meaning see it in my eyes  
If you see the beginning, then you'd realize  
  
[Chorus]  
Love is all you need  
All you need now  
If you just take me  
  
Just take me  
Just take me now  
Won't you just take me

I heard you come home late last night  
You moved so quietly  
Key in the door, light up the stairs  
But were you thinking of me?  
Don't want to lose you, don't want to harm you  
I just want to feel all right  
So how can I ask you who you were with last night?  
  
I listened to all your promises  
And lived with all those lies  
Pretending that I'm the only one  
When I've seen it in your eyes  
Maybe I need you, maybe it ain't true  
Maybe it's still all right  
So how can I ask you who you were with last night?  
How can I ask you who you were with last night?  
  
It's down to the feeling you get when you're with someone who really matters  
It's down to the love that you can show someone who really cares  
It's not up to you, it's not up to me  
Takes two people to agree  
It's down to the feeling you get when you're with someone who really matters  
  
Lately you and I ain't talked the way that lovers do  
Should accept the fact that maybe you've found someoe new  
If I could lose you, if I could hug you  
I'd still like to feel all right  
  
I wouldn't ask you who you were with  
I wouldn't ask you who you were with  
I wouldn't ask you who you were with last night  
I wouldn't ask you who you were with  
I wouldn't ask you who you were with  
I wouldn't ask you who you were with last night  
I wouldn't ask you who you were with last night

I had another drink after another drink and then I tried to crawl to the door  
I had another smoke after another joke and then I couldn't take any more  
It didn't change a thing, not any single thing, when someone tried to tell me
for sure  
I heard another voice that said I wasn't in a dream  
I read a word or two about everything  
I never knew the way that it oughta have been  
They never told me a thing about it  
I never did know a thing about it  
And the lies in the eyes of a thousand eyes they won't go away  
And the times that I tried are the times that I find they don't show today  
But you make me feel so good  
  
I woke up after four, still lying on the floor, and waiting to be carried away  
I woke up once again, a little after ten, will things be any better today  
It doesn't change you see, it only changes me, well someone tried to tell me
I'm sure  
I'm gonna hear a voice and know it isn't in a dream  
I'm gonna read the lines and get a look between  
I never knew the way that it oughta have been  
They never told me a thing about it  
I never did know a thing about it  
And the lies in the eyes of a thousand eyes, they won't go away  
And the times that I tried, are the times that I find they don't show today  
But you make me feel so good  
  
I'm going back to school, I'm gonna check the rule, and see if I get carried
away  
I'm going back again, I'm gonna try again, don't listen what the people might
say  
It doesn't change a thing, not any single thing, well someone tried to tell me
for sure  
I'm gonna hear a voice and know it isn't in a dream  
I'm gonna read the lines and get a look between  
I never knew the way that it oughta have been  
They never told me a thing about it  
I never did know a thing about it  
And the lies in the eyes of a thousand eyes, they won't go away  
And the times that I tried, are the times that I find they don't show today  
And the lies in the eyes of a thousand eyes, they won't go away  
And the times that I tried, are the times that I find they don't show today  
And the lies in the eyes of a thousand eyes, they won't go away  
And the times that I tried, are the times that I find they don't show today  
And the lies in the eyes of a thousand eyes, they won't go away  
And the lies in the eyes of a thousand eyes, they won't go away

She never has to worry and she never has to try  
She's never in a hurry and I know the reason why  
She's got her Daddy's and her fingers in some pies  
She makes a double of a trouble with her lies  
  
She says, Oh I'm mad about the boy  
She says, Oh I'm mad about the boy  
She says, Oh I'm mad about the boy  
  
She's always late to meet me and she always has to go  
To make another entry at another coolie show  
She is a dirty little lady but I know  
She only has to say the chorus and I go  
  
She says, Oh I'm mad about the boy  
She says, Oh-oh-oh I'm mad about the boy  
She says, Oh I'm mad about the boy  
  
Don't tell me your troubles  
I've got troubles that would make you scream and shout  
Don't tell me your troubles  
I've got troubles I will tell you all about  
No I don't take a drink, no I won't take a drink  
But I sure take some ups and some downs  
You makes me so weary  
You pick me up to put me down  
Don't tell me your troubles  
I've got troubles that would make you scream and shout  
Don't tell me your troubles  
I've got troubles I will tell you all about  
No I don't take a drink, no I won't take a drink  
But I sure take some ups and some downs  
You makes me so weary  
You pick it up and put me down  
You never have to worry and you never have to try  
You're never in a hurry and I know the reason why  
You got your Daddie's and your fingers in some pies  
You makes a double of a trouble with your lies  
  
You say, Oh I'm mad about the boy  
You say, Oh-oh-oh I'm mad about the boy  
You say, Oh I'm mad about the boy

Never been very good at the things that I should do better  
And I've tied very hard just to see if I could forget ya  
But never, ever could we get back together  
I doubt it somehow, doubt it, yes I do  
  
Did you think that I would be so good that it wouldn't matter  
And did you feel at the time that the weight of the time is greater  
It's magic, magic, everything else has had it  
It's magic, magic, everything that you do  
I've had it, magic, had that magical feeling  
  
Just call me and you know I'll be there  
Don't worry me you know I'll be there  
No matter if it's day or night, you  
Why worry if I say I'll be there  
  
Did it all, looking back at the road, maybe lacked some measure  
Could it be, could it be you and me wanted just the pleasure, my pleasure  
  
But magic, magic, everything else has had it  
It's magic, magic, everything that you do  
I've had it, magic, had that magical feeling  
  
Just call me and you know I'll be there  
Don't worry me you know I'll be there  
Won't matter if it's day or night, you  
Why worry if I say I'll be there  
  
Right or wrong, it's still the same  
It's a win-or-lose-it game  
  
Never been very good at the things that I should do better  
Could it be, could it be you and me wanted just the pleasure, my pleasure  
  
But magic, magic, everything else has had it  
It's magic, magic, everything that you do  
I've had it, magic, had that magical feeling  
Magic, oh it's magic, everything else has had it  
It's magic, magic, everything that you do  
I've had it, magic, had that magical feeling  
Magic, oh it's magic, everything else has had it...

There's a hole in my bed where I ain't seen you for days  
Got a pain in my head ''cause I'm back to my bad old ways  
I can't get out, you won't come in  
And you can't see the state I'm in  
On top of it all, my A string's gone again  
  
Everyday I'm a-wasting away, it's oh so bad  
My mind's gone dead and my eyes are red, it's oh so sad  
Nobody calls, they've had enough  
I've got to stop myself drinking this stuff  
On top of it all, my A string's gone again  
  
Oh no, oh no, man overboard you know, and I'm gonna drown  
Oh no, oh no, I'm wrecking myself and I'm running around  
  
Save my soul, I said save my soul  
Oh save my soul, I'm losing my grip  
I think I'm gonna slip, oh  
  
I gotta do something or I might as well be living in hell  
I gotta find someone who can break me away from this spell  
It's getting to me, it's bringing me down  
I'm cold and I'm lonely since you ain't around  
And on top of it all, my A string's gone again  
  
Oh no, oh no, man overboard you know, and I'm gonna drown  
Oh no, oh no, I'm wrecking myself and I'm running around  
  
Save my soul, save my soul  
Save my soul, I'm losing my grip  
I think I'm gonna slip, oh

Captured my heart  
Captured my memory  
Captured a time for me  
I could see  
A time for me  
Is gonna be  
  
Deep in my heart  
Deep in my memory  
Deep in a part of me  
Heart of me  
Meant to be history  
Could it be that I'm still wondering  
  
I never knew what had happened to me  
I didn't think it was true  
That I could be just like anyone else  
I'll take my chance with you  
  
Picture a dream  
Picture a fantasy  
Picture a mood of me  
Mystery you and me a mystery  
  
Lost in a dream  
Lost in a fantasy  
Lost in what seemed to be  
Dreams to be  
Seemed to be  
Had to be  
Couldn't find no other reason  
  
I never knew what had happened to me  
I didn't think it was true  
That I could be just like anyone else  
I'll take my chance with you  
  
Lets have a drink  
It's Marguerita time  
It's Marguerita time  
After nine  
Summer time  
Any time  
You'll still always find me wondering  
  
I never knew what had happened to me  
I didn't think it was true  
That I could be just like anyone else  
I'll take my chance with you

Well I saw my little lady walking down the street  
And I asked her, where you going to?  
Well I saw my little lady walking down the street  
She said she'd found somebody new  
Found myself all alone  
Ain't no fun on your own  
Now I'm like a rolling stone  
  
So I met another lady and so many more  
Didn't really know which way to go  
So I met another lady and so many more  
But no-one did I get to know  
Found myself all alone  
Ain't no fun on your own  
Now I'm like a rolling stone  
  
Well I saw my little lady walking down the street  
Now you know where she was going to  
Well I saw my little lady walking down the street  
Now you know what I've been going through  
Found myself all alone  
Ain't no fun on your own  
Living like a rolling stone  
  
I was like a rolling....  
I was like a rolling stone  
  
Walking alone, a street with no phone  
Could I be younger most of the time?  
Doing her wrong, taking so long  
Should I do all things in my own time?  
May I be wiser, yes, than most men will ever be?  
May I be younger most of the time  
Most of the time, most of the time  
Most of the time, most of the time  
  
May I be wiser, yes, than most men will ever be?  
May I be younger most of the time  
Most of the time, most of the time  
Most of the time, most of the time  
Most of the time, most of the time  
Most of the time, most of the time  
Most of the time, most of the time

You're climbing mountains in the sky  
You're always looking for another high  
You're looking so far ahead you're looking away  
I'm taking you in, you're taking me on  
Your smiling face never lets you down  
Where everyone who calls you friend remembers your name  
And everyone who called you friend will never again  
  
I'm taking a walk in your heart  
I'm feeling my way through the dark  
I'm taking a walk in your heart  
I'm taking a walk in your heart  
  
I've known the mountain ladies well  
They live a never-ending fairytale  
Where walking through another heart is all in a day  
They treat me well, they treat me nice  
They think that I'm gonna pay the price  
So now I'm gonna put you straight, you're playing my game  
  
I'm taking a walk in your heart  
I'm feeling my way through the dark  
Oh, I'm taking a walk in your heart  
I'm taking a walk in your heart  
  
There's never been a better reason at any time before  
''cause everything that we've been feeling is now an open door  
And as the snow is falling the mountains start to call  
But do I feel you walking in my heart?  
  
I'm taking a walk in your heart  
I'm feeling my way through the dark  
And I'm taking a walk in your heart  
Yeah, I'm taking a walk in your heart  
I'm feeling my way through the dark  
Yeah I'm taking a walk in your heart

I see that look on your face  
I see that look on your face  
I see that look on your face, oh-oh-oh  
  
The boys know what you're giving, you give the boys such a lot of fun  
And by the way that you make a living you've got the boys all on the run  
S.T.'s showing, you really got me going maybe you can give me a price  
I want to try it, yeah I want to buy it, tell me would you treat me nice  
Oh my legs are shaking, oh my heart is breaking  
I'm just feeling like a boy  
Now I just can't slow down, gotta get in, go down  
Have my share of what a joy  
  
Now I've got your name and number, I like to look upon your face  
And now you know that I want to take you, give me the time you can name  
the place  
Call me honey, you can take my money, baby we can make a deal  
I really mean it, gotta get between it, do you know the way I feel?  
Oh I'm feeling kinda like I've gotta find a way to make you understand  
Oh I know you're lying and your love I'm buying  
Oh I'm feeling like a man  
  
The boys know what you're giving, you give the boys such a lot of fun  
And by the way that you make a living you've got the boys all on the run  
S.T.'s showing, really got them going, you can even say the price  
They'll want to try it, even want to buy it if you really treat them nice  
But I'd rather take you, show that I can make you  
Good enough for just one man  
Oh I'm feeling kinda like I've gotta find a  
Way to make you understand

Writing songs that I think sound so strange  
Writing words that I feel I should change  
It's all right if they sound just like other songs  
My guitar strums along just the same  
If this song's underlined with my name  
  
Nanana na nana na na na na na na  
Nanana na nana na na na na na  
Nanana na nana na na na na na na  
Nanana na nana na na na na na  
  
Playing games that I think may be wrong  
Making sounds that can go on and on  
It's all right if you stay right on to the end  
If my song could've been just a bore  
Then I hope you may come back for more  
  
Nanana na nana na na na na na na  
Nanana na nana na na na na na  
Nanana na nana na na na na na na  
Nanana na nana na na na na na  
Nanana na nana na na na na na na  
Nanana na nana na na na na na...

You're so unrespecting  
You're interfering with my life  
  
Day and night, all the time, leave me alone  
  
Neighbour neighbour don't you worry what goes on in my home  
You're always looking for something to gossip about  
You run around from door to door  
Rollin' your mouth about things you don't know  
Neighbour neighbour don't you worry what goes on in my home  
Just leave me alone  
  
Neighbour neighbour don't worry how I treat my wife  
You tell everybody we fuss and fight every night, well it ain't right  
You've got your troubles, my troubles too  
Something bad's gonna happen to you  
Neighbour neighbour don't worry what goes on in my home  
Just leave me alone  
  
Day and night, all the time, yeah  
  
Neighbour neighbour don't worry who knocks on my front door  
Walking and talking and pacing all over the floor  
Peeping, sleeping, through the hall  
Keeping your big ears glued to my wall  
Neighbour neighbour don't worry what goes on in my home  
You know it's true  
  
You're interfering with my life, leave me alone neighbour  
Leave me alone, you go your way and I'll go mine  
  
You're so unrespecting

The world is in a mess, it's finished more or less  
It doesn't really matter  
And it's never too late to change it  
It's never too late to change it  
  
Did you take a look? Any sort of look?  
I'm sure you would remember  
'Cause it wouldn't need much explaining  
'Cause it's never too late for changing  
  
The world is in a mess, and finished more or less  
It doesn't really matter  
And it's never too late to change it  
It's never too late to change it  
It's never too late for changing  
Never too late for changing  
  
Now this old sea dog's gonna get away 'cross the water  
This old sea-dog is waving you bye-bye  
But I don't think God thought we'd get out of order  
This old sea-dog is waving you bye-bye  
  
But now it's getting late, too late to hesitate  
I can't wait any longer  
So there's no use in you complaining  
''cause it's never too late for changing  
  
Did you take a look? Any sort of look?  
I'm sure you would remember  
'Cause it wouldn't need much explaining  
'Cause it's never too late for changing  
  
I've told you once or twice it could be paradise  
So listen when I'm talking to you  
Shouldn't take much explaining  
The world is gonna need some changes  
Never too late to change it, never too late for changing  
Never too late to change it, never too late for changing  
  
Now this old sea dog's gonna get away 'cross the water  
This old sea-dog is waving you bye-bye  
But I don't think God thought we'd get out of order  
This old sea-dog is waving you bye-bye

Sitting on a corner watching half the world go by  
Thinking something 'long the lines of whiskey and rye  
Rolling to the left, rolling to my right  
Well, anybody out there wanna help me?  
Looking at a picture of the trouble and strife  
Even got a picture of the Queen  
Getting back to thinking 'bout the secrets of life  
Will I ever find another? No, it's just a dream  
Walking round in circles, oh I must have walked a mile  
Trying to imagine I was putting on my style  
Rolling to the left, rolling to my right  
Can't you see I'm going along the wrong lines?  
Searching for the person with a shoulder to cry on  
Calling out to almost anyone  
Have you got a secondary bed I could lie on  
You'd better watch your step or you'll be first in line  
Baby, baby, baby  
What the hell on earth is wrong with you?  
Baby, baby, baby  
What the hell am I supposed to do?  
Baby, baby, baby  
What the hell on earth is wrong with you?  
Baby, baby, baby  
What the hell am I supposed to do?  
Cutting back to visions taken from the silver screen  
Believing I was someone I had never been  
Rolling to my left, rolling to my right  
Surprised the motion picture is in black and white  
Sitting here alone is how it's gonna be  
Will my lucky star ever shine on me?  
I guess it's not a problem  
That's the way it's meant to be  
Oh, it's never been a problem  
It's never been a problem to me  
Baby, baby, baby  
What the hell on earth is wrong with you?  
Baby, baby, baby  
What the hell am I supposed to do?  
Baby, baby, baby  
What the hell on earth is wrong with you?  
Baby, baby, baby  
What the hell am I supposed to do?  
Woh, oh, oh, baby, baby, baby  
What the hell on earth is wrong with you?  
Baby, baby, baby  
What the hell am I supposed to do?  
Woh, oh, oh, baby, baby, baby  

When I'm talkin' nothing's getting through  
If I'm sreaming it's never clear to you  
Can you hear me, am I wasting my time?  
Am I working in a one man band?  
When I'm lookin' straight into your eyes  
Is there anyone home? You're tellin' me lies  
Listen to me, are you wasting my time?  
It's lonely in a one man band  
Lonely in a one man band  
Words out of line, don't ever hurt you  
Forever crying trying to turn you around  
Woh, oh, oh, oh  
Woh, oh, oh, oh  
Woh, oh, oh, oh  
Woh, oh, oh, oh  
One man band  
Anticipating what you're gonna do  
Still waiting for a sign from you  
Come together, are we wasting our time?  
And I'll always be a one man band  
I'll always be a one man band  
It's lonely in a one man band  
Woh, oh, oh, oh  
Woh, oh, oh, oh  
Woh, oh, oh, oh  
Woh, oh, oh, oh
