First time he saw the ground get busted  
He was ten and it was 1952  
His daddy worked hard from sunup to sundown  
And the goin' got tough behind them ol' grey mules  
  
The farm grew to be a moneymaker  
And the house he lived in grew up room by room  
The boy worked hard but soon got tired of farmin'  
So he slipped away one night 'neath the harvest moon  
  
His neck was red as Alabama clay  
But the city's call pulled him away  
He's got a factory job and runs a big machine  
He don't miss the farm or the fields of green  
  
Now the city's just a prison without fences  
His job is just a routine he can't stand  
And at night he dreams of wide-open spaces  
Fresh dirt between his toes and on his hands  
  
Then one day a picture came inside a letter  
Of a young girl with a baby in her arms  
And the words she wrote would change his life forever  
So he went to raise his family on the farm  
  
His neck is red as Alabama clay  
Now he's goin' home this time to stay  
Where the roots run deep on the family tree  
And the tractor rolls through the fields of green  
  
His neck is red as Alabama clay  
Now he's goin' home this time to stay  
Where the roots run deep on the family tree  
And the tractor rolls through the fields of green  
  
His neck is red as Alabama clay

I wrote our names a thousand times  
Just to see yours sitting next to mine  
Sent you flowers, cards unsigned anonymous  
  
In days to come like days that passed  
My heart beats for you, always has  
Though you know me only as anonymous  
  
In dreams at night I carry your books for you  
And when I rise a flame for you  
Always too shy to carry the whole thing through  
  
Like the light from that eternal flame  
Burns for one without a name  
My love forever will remain anonymous  
  
Oh you'll always wonder who it was  
Who it was  
It was just anonymous  
  
Well I wrote our names a thousand times  
Just to see yours sitting next to mine  
And I sent you flowers cards unsigned

Oh the snowflakes fell in silence  
Over Belleau Wood that night  
For a Christmas truce had been declared  
By both sides of the fight  
As we lay there in our trenches  
The silence broke in two  
By a German soldier singing  
A song that we all knew  
Though I did not know the language  
The song was "Silent Night"  
Then I heard my buddy whisper  
"All is calm and all is bright"  
Then the fear and doubt surrounded me  
'Cause I'd die if I was wrong  
But I stood up on my trench  
And I began to sing along  
Then across the frozen battlefield  
Another's voice joined in  
Until one by one each man became  
A singer of the hymn  
Then I thought that I was dreaming  
For right there in my sight  
Stood the German soldier  
'Neath the falling flakes of white  
And he raised his hand and smiled at me  
As if he seemed to say  
Here's hoping we both live  
To see us find a better way  
Then the devil's clock struck midnight  
And the skies lit up again  
And the battlefield where heaven stood  
Was blown to hell again  
But for just one fleeting moment  
The answer seemed so clear  
Heaven's not beyond the clouds  
It's just beyond the fear  
No, heaven's not beyond the clouds  
It's for us to find it here

Yesterday she thanked me  
For oiling that front door  
This morning when she wakes  
She won't be thankful anymore  
  
She'll never know how much I cared  
Just that I couldn't stay  
Shell never know the reason why  
I always run away  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Burning bridges  
One by one  
What I'm doing  
Can't be undone  
  
And I'm always hoping someday  
I'm gonna stop this running round  
But every time the chance comes up  
Another bridge goes down  
  
Last night we talked of old times  
Families and home towns  
She wondered if we both agree on  
Where we'd settle down  
  
And I told her that we'd cross that bridge  
Whenever it'd arrive  
Now through the flames I see her standing  
On the other side  
  
Burning bridges  
One by one  
What I'm doing  
Can't be undone  
  
And I'm always hoping someday  
I'm gonna stop this running round  
But every time the chance comes up  
Another bridge goes down  
  
Like ashes on the water  
I drift away in sorrow  
Knowing that the day my lessons finally learned  
I'll be standing at a river  
Staring out across tomorrow  
And the bridge I need to get there  
Will be a bridge that I have burned  
  
Burning bridges  
One by one  
What I'm doing  
Can't be undone  
  
And I'm always hoping someday  
I'm gonna stop this running round  
But every time the chance comes up  
Another bridge goes down  
  
Another bridge goes down

May not know by lookin' at me  
Who you're looking at exactly  
Wonder who could that be in your stockin'  
Suit of red and cheeks of cherry  
Lookin' extraordinary  
Spare me cause you scare with your gawkin'  
Hold your applause  
Pick up your jaws  
Call me Claus, hoah  
I got the spirit of the season in me  
Spreadin' joy and toys a'plenty  
Nimbly down your chimney I'll be bumpin'  
Give me room 'cause I'm a packin'  
Only time for toys and snackin'  
Love to stay here yackin'  
But I'm humpin'

No time to pause  
They call me Claus  
Hoah, call me Santa  
Call me Kringle  
Call me Old Saint Nick  
All those have a beautiful ring  
Pleasin' is the reason  
And the season's a kick  
When your Santa  
Baby, you gotta swing  
Swing, I dare ya, yeah  
Hey, call me Santa  
Call me Kringle

All those have a beautiful ring  
Pleasin' is the reason  
And the season's a kick  
When you Santa  
Baby, you gotta swing  
So while in your jammies sleepin'  
Roof to roof I'll be a leapin'  
Quickly if your creepin' for a peepin'  
The oohs and aahs  
Are all because  
They call me Claus  
Hold your applause  
Hey, watch the paws  
They call me Claus

I spent last night in the arms of a girl in Louisiana  
And though I'm out on the highway, my thoughts are still with her  
Such a strange combination of a woman and a child  
Such a strange situation stoppin' every hundred miles  
Callin' Baton Rouge  
  
A replay of last night's events roll through my mind  
Except a scene or two erased by sweet red wine  
And I see a truck stop sign ahead, so I change lanes  
I need a cup of coffee and a couple dollars change  
Callin' Baton Rouge  
  
Operator, won't you put me on through  
I gotta send my love down to Baton Rouge  
Hurry up, won't you put her on the line  
I gotta talk to the girl just one more time  
  
Hello, Samantha dear, I hope you're feelin' fine  
And it won't be long until I'm with you all the time  
But until then, I'll spend my money up right down to my last dime  
Callin' Baton Rouge  
  
Operator, won't you put me on through  
I gotta send my love down to Baton Rouge  
Hurry up, won't you put her on the line  
I gotta talk to the girl just one more time  
Callin' Baton Rouge  
  
Sweet Baton Rouge

He told a good story  
And all us kids listened  
'Bout his life on the border  
And the way it was then  
  
And we all believed  
And when he would finish  
We'd ask the old cowboy  
To tell 'em again  
  
You could almost hear  
Those prairie winds blowing  
His saddle a creakin'  
Beneath his old faded jeans  
  
You could taste the dry dust  
From the trail he was ridin'  
As he sat there and painted  
Those west Texas scenes  
  
And the grown-ups would tell us  
You boys keep your distance  
That old man's just telling you lies  
But to all of us kids  
Cowboy Bill was a hero  
Just as true  
As the blue texas sky.  
  
He told of a time  
When he rode with the rangers  
Down on the pecos  
And he saved the day  
  
Outnumbered by plenty  
They were almost to cover  
With thirty banditos  
Headed their way  
  
He looked back just in time  
To see a horse stumble  
The captain went down  
And Bill pulled up on his reigns  
  
Through a flurry of bullets  
He rescued the captain  
They rode for the sunset  
Just the story remains  
  
And the grown-ups would tell us  
You boys keep your distance  
That old man's just telling you lies  
But to all of us kids  
Cowboy Bill was a hero  
Just as true  
As the blue texas sky.  
  
Well I still remember  
The day that it happened  
We waited and we waited  
But Bill never showed  
  
The folks at the feed store  
Said they hadn't seen him  
So we set out for his place  
Down on old grist mill road  
  
And we cried when we found him  
Lying there with his memories  
The old trunk wide open  
Things scattered about  
  
He was clutching a badge  
That said Texas Rangers  
And an old yellow letter  
Said "Texas is Proud"  
  
And the grown-ups that told us  
You boys keep your distance  
That old man's just telling you lies  
Now... they're all saying  
Cowboy Bill was a hero  
Just as true  
As the blue texas sky.  
  
Just as true  
As the blue texas sky.

I've never known one better  
She's a real go getter  
If you met her you'd be good as gone  
She's a real red liner  
Likes it all behind her  
She's the kind that keeps you hangin' on  
  
She's a cowboy's buddy  
Even when she gets muddy  
Lord she's lovely from her front to back  
So either comin' or goin'  
Know her best side's showin'  
She's my cowboy Cadillac  
  
She's the perfect picture  
Of the perfect mixture  
Tween a woman and a fine machine  
She's a hard work lover  
A real tough mother  
She's the cover of a magazine  
And I'm happy knowin'  
That what keeps me goin'  
Is what's gonna keep me comin' back  
She's my honkin' tonkin'  
Everything I'm wantin'  
Cowboy Cadillac  
  
She loves to haul them cattle  
All my ropes and saddle  
And it doesn't matter work or play  
If it's a mountain she can crawl it  
If it's hay then she can haul it  
She's the last one to call it a day  
  
She's the perfect picture  
Of the perfect mixture  
Tween a woman and a fine machine  
She's a hard work lover  
A real tough mother  
She's the cover of a magazine  
And I'm happy knowin'  
That what keeps me goin'  
Is what's gonna keep me comin' back  
She's my honkin' tonkin'  
Everything I'm wantin'  
Cowboy Cadillac

On the eighth day God noticed a problem  
For there below Him stood a cowboy alone  
Stubborn and proud, reckless and loud  
God knew he'd never make it on his own  
So God looked out all over creation  
And listened as that cowboy prayed  
God took passion and thunder  
Patience and wonder then He sent down  
The best thing that God ever made  
  
Cowboys and angels leather and lace  
Salt of the earth meets heavenly grace  
Cowboys and angels tested and tried  
It's a long way to heaven  
And one hell of a ride  
  
Nothin's changed since the dawn of creation  
For you will find them together today  
And only heaven above them knows why she loves him  
But he must be the reason she don't fly away  
  
Cowboys and angels leather and lace  
Salt of the earth meets heavenly grace  
Cowboys and angels tested and tried  
It's a long way to heaven  
And one hell of a ride  
It's a long way to heaven  
And one hell of a ride

Sometimes you've got to take the heat  
If you're gonna walk down the mean street  
Take the heat and you see it through  
"Cause sometimes it comes down to  
Do what you gotta do  
Sometimes it goes right down to the wire  
And you might have to walk through the fire  
Walk on boy all the way through  
Sometimes it just comes down to  
Do what you gotta do  
Well there's people that'll tell you  
It's just no use  
And there's people that'll tell you  
That you're gonna lose  
People that'll tell you  
Anything you're gonna listen to  
Do what you gotta do  
Someday they're going to call your name  
They'll come looking for some one to blame  
What's your name, boy  
Hey, you just tell them true  
"Cause they can't take the truth from you  
So do what you gotta do  
Well, they'll call you a hero or a traitor  
But you'll find out that, sooner or later,  
Nobody in this world is gonna do it for you  
Do what you gotta do  
There ain't nobody in this world  
That's gonna do it for you  
Do what you gotta do

I walked down to the park last night  
Warm breeze stirring up a soft moonlight  
And my mind started drifting to way back when  
Yes I do think about you every now and then  
  
The other day I saw a car like you used to drive  
I got a funny feeling down deep inside  
And for the briefest moment I felt a smile begin  
Yes I do think about you every now and then  
  
[Chorus]  
I love my life and I've never trade  
Between what you and me had and the life I've made  
She's here and she's real, but you were too  
and every once in a while I think about you  
  
I heard a song on the radio just yesterday  
The same one you always asked me to play  
And when the song was over  
I wished they played it again  
Yes I do think about you every now and then  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I've been layin' here all night listenin' to the rain  
Talkin' to my heart and trying to explain  
Why sometimes I catch myself  
Wondering what might have been  
Yes I do think about you every now and then  
Every now and then  
Every now and then

Lazy yellow moon coming up tonight  
Shining through the trees  
Crickets are singing and lightning bugs  
Are floating on the breeze, baby, get ready  
  
'Cross the field where the creek turns back  
By the old stump road  
I'm gonna take you to a special place  
That nobody knows, baby, get ready  
  
You and me going fishin' in the dark  
Lying on our backs and counting the stars  
Where the cool grass grows  
Down by the river in the full moonlight  
  
We'll be falling in love in the middle of the night  
Just moving slow  
Spend the whole night through  
Feels so good to be with you  
  
Spring is almost over and the summer's coming  
The days are getting long  
I've waited all winter for the time to be right  
Just to take you along, baby, get ready  
  
And it don't matter if we sit forever  
And the fish don't bite  
We'll jump in the river and cool ourselves  
From the heat of the night, baby, get ready  
  
You and me going fishin' in the dark  
Lying on our backs and counting the stars  
Where the cool grass grows  
Down by the river in the full moonlight  
  
We'll be falling in love in the middle of the night  
Just moving slow  
Spend the whole night through  
Feels so good to be with  
You and me going fishin' in the dark  
Lying on our backs and counting the stars  
Where the cool grass grows  
Down by the river in the full moonlight  
  
We'll be falling in love in the middle of the night  
Just moving slow  
You and me going fishin' in the dark  
Lying on our backs and counting the stars  
Where the cool grass grows  
  
Down by the river in the full moonlight  
We'll be falling in love in the middle of the night  
Just moving slow  
You and me going fishin' in the dark

His pulpit's a corner at 19th and Main  
His grip on the gospel is his one claim to fame  
He hurls fire and brimstone at the cars passin' by  
He offers salvation from the savior on high  
  
His khakis are tattered, he ain't bathed in weeks  
His bouts with the bottle show up on his cheeks  
He looks like a scarecrow, a sight to behold  
While he works for the shepherd, bringin' lambs to the fold  
  
He points to the Bible he holds in his hand  
Says, I'm proof that the good Lord can save any man  
  
Son, it ain't what you're drivin' or the clothes that you wear  
Material possessions won't matter up there  
Someday in heaven with the angels I'll sing  
And these rags that I'm wearin' will be fit for a king  
  
He's fightin' a fever, in spite of the chills  
He pulls up his collar and speaks of God's will  
His body is weakened but his faith is still strong  
He's filled with conviction for the mission he's on  
  
'Cause a mansion is waitin', he'll be homeless no more  
And his words will still echo from that far distant shore  
  
Son, it ain't what you're drivin' or the clothes that you wear  
Material possessions won't matter up there  
Someday in heaven with the angels I'll sing  
And these rags that I'm wearin' will be fit for a king

Blame it all on my roots  
I showed up in boots  
And ruined your black tie affair  
The last one to know  
The last one to show  
I was the last one  
You thought you'd see there  
And I saw the surprise  
And the fear in his eyes  
When I took his glass of champagne  
And I toasted you  
Said honey we may be through  
But you'll never hear me complain  
  
'Cause I've got friends in low places  
Where the whiskey drowns  
And the beer chases my blues away  
And I'll be okay  
I'm not big on social graces  
Think I'll slip on down to the oasis  
Oh I've got friends in low places  
  
Well I guess I was wrong  
I just don't belong  
But then I've been there before  
Everything's all right  
I'll just say goodnight  
And I'll show myself to the door  
Hey I didn't mean  
To cause a big scene  
Just give me an hour and then  
Well I'll be as high  
As that ivory tower  
That you're livin' in  
  
'Cause I've got friends in low places  
Where the whiskey drowns  
And the beer chases my blues away  
And I'll be okay  
I'm not big on social graces  
Think I'll slip on down to the oasis  
Oh I've got friends in low places  
  
I've got friends in low places  
Where the whiskey drowns  
And the beer chases my blues away  
And I'll be okay  
I'm not big on social graces  
Think I'll slip on down to the oasis  
Oh I've got friends in low places  
  
I've got friends in low places  
Where the whiskey drowns  
And the beer chases my blues away  
And I'll be okay  
I'm not big on social graces  
Think I'll slip on down to the oasis  
Oh I've got friends in low places  
  
I've got friends in low places  
Where the whiskey drowns  
And the beer chases my blues away  
And I'll be okay.

God rest ye merry gentlemen  
Let nothing you dismay  
Remember Christ our savior  
Was born on Christmas day  
To save us all from Satan's power  
When we were gone astray  
Oh tidings of comfort and joy  
  
From God our heavenly father  
The blessed angel came  
And unto certain shepherds  
Brought tidings of the same  
How that in Bethlehem was born  
The Son of God by name  
Oh tidings of comfort and joy  
Oh tidings of comfort and joy  
  
Fear not said the angel  
Let nothing you alright  
This day is born a savior  
Of the pure virgin bright  
To free all those who trust in him  
From Satan's power and might  
Oh tidings of comfort and joy  
  
And when they came to Bethlehem  
Where our dear savior lay  
They found him in the manger  
Where oxen feed on hay  
His mother Mary knelled down  
And to the Lord did pray  
Oh tidings of comfort and joy  
Oh tidings of comfort and joy  
  
God rest ye merry gentlemen  
Let nothing you dismay  
Remember Christ our savior  
Was born on Christmas day

From the hills of Kaycee, Wyoming,  
Where life's wooly and wild  
Came a Navy brat, In a cowboy hat  
And that Copenhagen smile  
  
And from buckin' broncs to honky tonks  
He always sang a cowboy song  
We were much to young, Having too much fun  
As we all sang along  
  
And we sang Life's a Highway  
There's only one way you're gonna get through it  
When she starts to twist, be more like Chris  
Pull your hat down tight, and just LeDoux it  
When that whistle blows, and the crowd explodes  
And them pickup-men are at your side  
They tell you "Good ride, cowboy, good ride."  
  
(Take a ride)  
  
Well gold buckles to gold records  
Once again he was spinnin' round  
Took the whole world on, And he turned us on  
To that Western underground  
  
And from bareback jack to this cowboy's hat  
The songs were stronger than his pain  
He would not slow down, From town to town  
Like children running through the rain  
  
And he sang Life's a Highway  
There's only one way you're gonna get through it  
When she starts to twist, be more like Chris  
Pull your hat down tight, and just LeDoux it  
When that whistle blows, and that crowd explodes  
And them pickup-men are at your side  
They tell you "Good ride, cowboy, good ride."  
  
We sang Life's a Highway  
There's only one way you're gonna get through it (yeah!)  
When she starts to twist, be more like Chris  
Pull your hat down tight ("let me have it!"), and just LeDoux it  
When that whistle blows, and that crowd explodes  
And them pickup-men are at your side  
They tell you "Good ride, cowboy, good ride."  
  
Then he crossed that River Jordan  
With St. Peter on the other side  
Singin' "Good ride, cowboy, good ride"  
Say "Good ride, cowboy, good ride!"

If never I'd met you  
I'd never have seen you cry  
If not for our first hello  
We'd never have to say goodbye  
  
If never I held you  
My feeling's would never show  
It's time I start walkin'  
But there's so much you'll never know  
  
I keep telling you hard luck woman  
You ain't a hard luck woman  
  
Rags, a sailor's only daughter  
A child of the water  
Too proud to be a queen  
  
Rags, I really love you  
I can't forget about you  
You'll be a hard luck woman  
Baby, till you find your man  
  
Before I go let me kiss you  
And wipe the tears from your eyes  
I don't wanna hurt you, girl  
You know I could never lie  
  
I keep telling you a hard luck woman  
You ain't a hard luck woman  
You'll be a hard luck woman  
Baby, till you find your man  
  
Rags, a sailor's only daughter  
A child of the water  
Too proud to be a queen  
  
Rags, I really love you

Baby, till you find your man  
You'll be a hard luck woman  
Baby, till you find your man  
  
You'll be a hard luck woman  
Baby, till you find your man  
  
Hard luck woman  
Hard luck woman  
Hard luck woman  
Hard luck woman

That old wind that's whipping out there  
It's whistlin' your tune  
That wind blew pyramids to Egypt  
And footprints to the moon  
And that old star that you been wishin' on  
Is shinin' mighty bright  
But it's the fire inside your heart  
That's gonna lead you to the light  
How you ever gonna know  
What it's like to live there  
How you ever gonna know victory  
How you ever gonna know  
What it's like when dreams become reality  
How you ever gonna know  
How it feels to hold her  
How you ever gonna know  
What it's like to dance  
How you ever gonna know  
If you never take a chance  
You know failure isn't failure  
If a lesson from it's learned  
I guess love would not be love  
Without a risk of being burned  
Anything in life worth havin'  
Lord, it has its sacrifice  
But the gift that you're receiving  
Is worth more than a price  
How you ever gonna know  
What it's like to live there  
How you ever gonna know  
What you never knew  
How you ever gonna know  
If you're down here doin'  
What the good Lord put you here to do  
How you ever gonna know  
If you could have done it  
How you ever gonna know  
How it feels to fly  
How you ever gonna know  
If you never dare to try  
Listen not to the critics  
Who put their own dreams on the shelf  
If you want to get the truth to admit it  
You gotta find out for yourself  
How you ever gonna know  
What it's like to be there  
How you ever gonna know  
If you're the best  
How you ever gonna know  
What you believe in  
If you don't put it to the test  
How you ever gonna know  
How it feels to hold him  
How you ever gonna know  
What livin' means  
How you ever gonna know  
If you never chase the dreams  
How you ever gonna know  
Your potential  
How you ever gonna know victory  
How you ever gonna know  
What it's like when dreams become reality  
How you ever gonna know  
How it feels to hold her  
How you ever gonna know  
What it's like to dance  
How you ever gonna know  
If you never take a chance

Drove to the church  
In my suit and tie  
But I just couldn't bring myself  
To go inside  
So I sat alone  
In my truck across the street  
Watched that chauffeur smokin' cigarettes  
By that long white limousine  
I could just imagine  
What was goin' on in there  
Sunlight streamin' through the stained glass  
And those flowers in her hair  
And in less time than it takes a tear to fall  
Those bells rang loud as thunder  
As they opened up the doors  
Now I don't have to wonder anymore  
Laughin' and a cryin'  
Tossin' that bouquet  
And when you got in that limo  
I drove off the other way  
And I still don't know  
Why things happened like they did  
But I parked that old pickup  
On that lonesome river bridge  
I took your ring from my pocket  
And I held it one last time  
Watched that diamond sparkle  
I drew back and I let her fly  
And in less time than it takes to tear to fall  
Oh that old ring went under  
Lord and now it's gone for sure  
No and I don't have to wonder anymore  
Well the angels sang like thunder  
As I felt myself go under  
Now I don't have to wonder anymore

When all your loves have ended  
When all your friends have flown  
Who'll be around to want you  
When all your loves have gone  
  
Only a fool would do it  
After the way you've done  
And how many fools would have you  
I know one  
This fool keeps wondering why he fell in love at all  
But you might need this fool around in case you fall  
After the party's over and you've had your fill of fun  
If you need a fool to forgive you...i know one  
  
You never know you might be lonely when all your loves have missed  
It wouldn't hurt to keep an extra fool on your list  
After your heart's been broken and you need a place to run  
If you'll take a fool who loves you...i know one...i know one

Sometimes late at night  
I lie awake and watch her sleeping  
She's lost in peaceful dreams  
So I turn out the lights and lay there in the dark  
And the thought crosses my mind  
If I never wake up in the morning  
Would she ever doubt the way I feel  
About her in my heart  
If tomorrow never comes  
Will she know how much I loved her  
Did I try in every way  
To show her every day  
That she's my only one  
If my time on earth were through  
And she must face the world without me  
Is the love I gave her in the past  
Gonna be enough to last  
If tomorrow never comes  
'Cause I've lost loved ones in my life  
Who never knew how much I loved them  
Now I live with the regret  
That my true feelings for them never were revealed  
So I made a promise to myself  
To say each day how much she means to me  
And avoid that circumstance  
Where there's no second chance  
To tell her how I feel  
If tomorrow never comes  
Will she know how much I loved her  
Did I try in every way  
To show her every day  
That she's my only one  
If my time on earth were through  
And she must face the world without me  
Is the love I gave her in the past  
Gonna be enough to last  
If tomorrow never comes  
So tell that someone that you love  
Just what you're thinking of  
If tomorrow never comes

In another's eyes  
I'm someone who  
Loves her enough  
To walk away from you  
I'd never cheat  
And I would never lie  
In another's eyes  
In another's eyes  
I can do no wrong  
And he believes in me  
And his faith is strong  
I'd never fall  
Or even compromise  
In another's eyes  
In another's eyes  
I'm afraid that I can't see  
This picture perfect portrait  
That they paint of me  
They don't realize  
And I pray they never do  
'Cause every time I look  
I'm seein' you  
In another's eyes  
In another's eyes  
Starin' back at me  
I see a sinkin' soul  
Tryin' desperately  
To turn the tide  
Before it dies  
In another's eyes  
And what they don't see  
Is killing me  
It's blessing and a curse  
That love is blind  
'Cause in another's eyes  
I'm afraid that I can't see  
This picture perfect portrait  
That they paint of me  
And they don't realize  
And I pray to God they never do  
'Cause every time I look  
I'm seein' you  
In another's eyes

She was a girl on a wagon train  
Haded west across the plains  
The train got lost in a summer storm  
They couldn't move west and they couldn't go home  
Then she saw him ridin' through the rain  
He took charge of the wagons and he saved the train  
And she looked down and her heart was gone  
The train went west but she stayed on  
In Lonesome Dove  
  
A farmer's daughter with a gentle hand  
A blooming rose in a bed of sand  
She loved the man who wore a star  
A Texas Ranger known near and far  
So they got married and they had a child  
But times were touch and the West was wild  
So it was no surprise the day she learned  
That her Texas man would not return  
To Lonesome Dove  
  
Back to back with the Rio Grande  
A Christian woman in the devil's land  
She learned the language and she learned to fight  
But she never learned how to beat the lonely nights  
In Lonesome Dove, Lonesome Dove  
  
She watched her boy grow into a man  
He had an angel's heart and the devil's hand  
He wore his star for all to see  
He was a Texas lawman legacy  
The one day word blew into town  
It seemed the men that shot his father down  
Had robbed a bank in Cherico  
The only thing 'tween them and Mexico  
Was Lonesome Dove  
  
The shadows stretched across the land  
As the shots rang out down the Rio Grande  
And when the smoke had finally cleared the street  
The men lay at the ranger's feet  
But legend tells to this very day  
That shots were comin' from an alleyway  
Though no one knows who held the gun  
There ain't no doubt if you ask someone  
In Lonesome Dove  
Back to back with the Rio Grande  
A Christian woman in the devil's land  
She learned the language and she learned to fight  
But she never learned how to beat the lonely nights  
In Lonesome Dove, Lonesome Dove

It don't matter to the sun  
If you go or if you stay  
I know the sun is gonna rise  
Shine down on another day  
There will still be a tomorrow  
Even if you choose to leave  
'Cause it don't matter to the sun (oh baby)  
It matters to me  
  
It ain't gonna stop the world  
If you walk out that door  
This old world will just keep on turning 'round (Turning 'round)  
Like it did the day before  
'Cause see to them it makes no difference (ohh)  
It just keeps on keepin' time  
'Cause it ain't gonna stop the world (Oh baby)  
But it'll be the end of mine  
  
What can I say  
What can I do  
I'm still in love  
So without you...  
  
(GuitarPiano solo)  
Mmm mmm mmm, oh yeah, oh yeah  
What can I say  
What can I do  
I'm still in love  
So without you  
  
It don't matter the moon  
If your not in my life  
No the moon will just keep hangin' 'round (hangin' 'round)  
Like it's just another night  
Find another place to shine on down  
On some other lovers dreams  
'Cause it don't matter the moon (oh baby)  
But is sure do matter to me  
No it don't matter to the moon (oh baby)  
But it matters to me

It's midnight Cinderella  
But don't you worry none  
'Cause I'm Peter, Peter the Pumpkin Eater  
And the party has just begun  
  
I guess you're prince charming  
Wasn't after all  
'Cause he sure seemed different right after the ball  
I guess that more than horses  
Are turnin' into rats  
And by the way he's walkin'  
I can guess where your slippers at  
  
[Chorus]  
It's midnight Cinderella  
Time that you should know  
There's gonna be some changes in the way this story goes  
It's midnight Cinderella  
But don't you worry none  
'Cause I'm Peter, Peter the pumpkin eater  
And the party has just begun  
  
I'm gonna help you get over  
Bein' under that spell  
You're gonna learn to love midnight  
Inside this pumpkin shell  
I gotta few new magic tricks  
Your Godmother can't do  
And I'll show you want it means to bip, bip, bip, bip, boppity, boo hoo  
  
[Chorus]

Standing in the spotlight  
On such a perfect night  
Knowing that your out there listening  
I remember one time  
When I was so afraid  
Didn't think I had the courage  
To stand up on this stage  
Then you reached into my heart  
And you found the melody  
And if there ever was somebody  
Who made me believe in me  
It was you  
It was you  
It was your song that made me sing  
It was your voice that gave me wings  
And it was your light that shined  
Guiding my heart to find  
This place where I belong  
It was your song  
Every night I pray  
Before the music starts to play  
That I'll do my best and I won't let you down  
And for all the times I've stood here  
This feeling feels brand new  
And any time I doubt myself I think of you  
'Cause It was your song that made me sing  
It was your voice that gave me wings  
And it was your light that shined  
Guiding my heart to find  
This place where I belong  
It was your song  
Dreams can come true  
With God's great angels like you  
It was your song that made me sing  
It was your voice that gave me wings  
And it was your light that shined  
Guiding my heart to find  
This place where I belong  
It was your song  
It was your song  
It's always been your song

[Chorus]  
Last night I had the strangest dream  
I ever dreamed before  
'Cause I dreamed the world  
Had all agreed to put an end to war  
  
I dreamed I saw a mighty room  
Filled with women and men  
And the papers they were signing said  
They'd never fight again  
  
And when the papers were all signed  
And a million copies made  
They all joined hands and they bowed their heads  
And grateful prayers were prayed  
  
And the people in the streets below  
Were dancing 'round and 'round  
And swords and guns and uniforms  
Were scattered on the ground  
  
[Chorus]

I burned my hand, I cut my face  
Heaven knows how long it's been  
Since I've felt so out of place  
I'm wonderin' if I'll fit in  
  
Debbie and Charley said they'd be here by nine  
And Deb said she might bring a friend  
Just my luck, they're right on time  
So here I go again  
  
I'm gonna smile my best smile  
And I'm gonna laugh like it's going out of style  
Look into her eyes and pray that she don't see  
That learning to live again is killing me  
  
Little cafe, table for four  
But there's just conversation for three  
I like the way she let me get the door  
I wonder what she thinks of me  
  
Debbie just whispered, "You're doin' fine"  
And I wish that I felt the same  
She's asked me to dance, now her hand's in mine  
Oh, my god, I've forgotten her name  
  
But I'm gonna smile my best smile  
And I'm gonna laugh like it's going out of style  
Look into her eyes and pray that she don't see  
That learning to live again is killing me  
  
Now here we are beneath her porch light  
And I say what a great time it's been  
A kiss on the cheek, a whisper goodnight  
And I say, "can I see you again"  
  
And she just smiles her best smile  
And she laughs like it's going out of style  
Looks into my eyes and says, "We'll see"  
Oh this learning to live again is killing me  
God this learning to live again is killing me

There's no more waiting  
Holding out for love  
You are my Godsend  
That I have been forever dreaming of  
My angel from above  
  
Heaven knows  
I'm head over heels and it shows  
I've played every field I suppose  
But there's something about you  
When you're around  
Baby I have found  
I get lost in you  
  
What is this feeling  
I've never known before  
That I should touch you  
Swearing to surrender ever more  
That's what I came here for  
  
Heaven knows  
I'm head over heels and it shows  
I've played every field I suppose  
But there's something about you  
When you're around  
Baby I have found  
I get lost in a wonderful daze  
Lost in your wonderful ways  
  
Heaven knows  
  
When you're around  
Baby I have found  
I get lost  
  
Heaven knows  
I'm head over heels and it shows  
I've played every field I suppose  
But there's something about you  
When you're around  
Baby I have found  
I get lost in you

Mary Had A Little Lamb  
One Holy Morning  
Neath The Star Of Bethlehem  
A Brand New Day Was Forming  
Guided By The Shining Light  
And The Angel's Voice  
Wise Men Traveled Through The Night  
To See The Baby Boy  
  
[Chorus:]  
Cause Mary Had A Little Lamb  
King Of Kings And Son Of Man  
Mary Had A Little lamb Of God  
  
They Gathered Round To See The Lamb  
In The Manger Sleeping  
Such A Humble Throne For Him  
The Promise Of God Was Keeping  
There The Shepherds Bowed Their Heads  
Among The Cattle Lowing  
The First Ever Christmas Gift  
Was Wrapped In Swaddling Clothes  
  
(Chorus)  
  
For The World A Sacrifice  
Mary Did Give Birth  
The Way She Held Him In Her Arms  
Is How He Holds The Earth

Yesterday the odds were stacked in favor of my expectations  
Flyin' above the rest, never fallin' from the nest  
Tuesday came and went and I'm in a little situation  
Maybe it's for the best, I could live alone, I guess  
  
Maybe I could stand alone  
Maybe I'm strong as stone  
Even though the bird has flown  
Maybe she'll fly on home  
  
Excuse me if I'm keeping you apart from better conversation  
Hung up on all my doubt, trying to sort the whole thing out  
Tell me that I'm smart enough to deal with all the information  
Spinning inside my head, every word she ever said  
  
Maybe I could stand alone  
Maybe I'm strong as stone  
Even though the bird has flown  
Maybe she'll fly on home  
  
Maybe I could stand alone  
Maybe I'm strong as stone  
Even though the bird has flown  
Maybe she'll fly on home  
  
Even though the bird has flown  
Maybe she'll fly on home

I know you don't know me  
Only our eyes have met  
But what yours are saying  
Is making me sweat  
The dance floor is empty  
Why don't you meet me in love  
  
Your breath on my body  
The touch of your skin  
Your touch is ungodly  
And way beyond sin  
I've fallen so deeply  
Beggin you meet me in love  
  
Darling please meet me  
And I'll whisper sweetly  
You're the one  
All my life  
That I've dreamed of  
I've fallen so deeply  
I'm yours completely  
So darling please meet me forever in love  
  
Lips warm and tender  
Ask if I'll always care  
Simply surrender  
And follow me there  
Trust me completely  
Darling please meet me in love  
  
Darling please meet me  
Ever so sweetly in love

People say she's only in my head  
It's gonna take time but I'll forget  
They say I need to get on with my life  
But they don't realize  
  
Is when your dialing six numbers just to hang up the phone.  
Driving cross town just to see if she's home.  
Waking a friend in the dead of night, just to hear 'em say it's gonna be
alright.  
When your finding things to do not to fall asleep  
'Cause you know she'll be there in your dreams.  
That's when she's  
More than a memory  
  
Took a match to everything she ever wrote  
Watched her words go up in smoke  
Tore all the pictures off the wall  
But that ain't helping me at all.  
  
'Cause when your talking out loud and nobody's there  
You look like hell and you just don't care  
Drinking more than you've ever drank  
Sinking down lower than you've ever sank  
When you find yourself falling down upon your knees,  
Praying to God, begging him please  
That's when she's  
More than a memory  
  
She's more  
She's more  
  
'Cause when your dialing her number just to hang up the phone  
Driving cross town just to see if she's home  
Waking a friend in the dead of night, just to hear 'em say it's gonna be
alright  
When our finding things to do not to fall asleep  
'Cause you know she'll be waiting in your dreams  
That's when she's  
More than a memory  
  
People say she's only in my head  
Its gonna take time but I'll forget

She use to be my rosa amarilla  
My little Mexicali tomatilla  
But then one night I drank too much sangria  
Woke up and found a note that said I'll see ya  
  
(Chorus)  
Oh, my baby no esta aqui no more  
My baby no esta aqui no more  
She left me here with nada  
Broke my heart like a pinata  
My baby no esta aqui no more  
  
Whoa, whoa, whoa, if you see her  
Please, please tell her that I need her  
  
I used to be her number one vaquero  
Her numero uno caballero  
But I've had to hock my spurs and my sombrero  
'Cause when she left she took all my dinero  
  
(Repeat Chorus)  
  
Whoa, whoa, whoa, if you see her  
Please, please tell her that I need her  
  
Oh, my baby no esta aqui no more  
My baby no esta aqui no more  
she left me here with nada  
Broke my heart like a pinata  
My baby no esta aqui  
My baby no esta aqui  
My baby no esta aqui no more

Papa drove a truck nearly all his life  
You know it drove mama crazy being a trucker's wife  
The part she couldn't handle was the being alone  
I guess she needed more to hold than just a telephone  
Papa called Mama each and every night  
Just to ask her how she was and if us kids were alright  
Mama would wait for that call to come in  
When Daddy'd hang up then she was gone again  
Mama was a looker  
Lord, how she shined  
Papa was a good'n  
But the jealous kind  
Papa loved Mama  
Mama loved men  
Mama's in the graveyard  
Papa's in the pen  
Well, it was bound to happen and one night it did  
Papa came home and it was just us kids  
He had a dozen roses and a bottle of wine  
If he was lookin' to surprise us, he was doin' fine  
I heard him cry for mama up and down the hall  
Then I heard a bottle break against the bedroom wall  
That old diesel engine made an eerie sound  
When Papa fired it up and headed into town  
Well, the picture in the paper showed the scene real well  
Papa's rig was buried in the local motel  
The desk clerk said he saw it all real clear  
He never hit the brakes and he was shifting gears  
Mama was a looker  
Lord, how she shined  
Papa was a good'n  
But the jealous kind  
Papa loved Mama  
Mama loved men  
Mama's in the graveyard  
Papa's in the pen

Doctor, you ain't got a pill  
For whatever's making this world I'll  
You can't get forgiveness at the store  
And peace, it's a politician's war  
You won't find no resolution in the bottom of a bottle  
In the stars or Aristotle  
The only answer to the problem is  
  
People loving people  
That's the enemy of everything that's evil  
Ain't no quick fix at the end of a needle  
It's just people loving people  
  
Words aren't what they seem to be  
Talk is cheap and lies are free  
We fear what we don't understand  
And we've been scared since time began  
All the colors and the cultures  
Circle 'round us on a spindle  
It'd a complicated riddle  
But the solution is so simple  
  
It's people loving people  
That's the enemy of everything that's evil  
Ain't no quick fix at the end of a needle  
It's just people loving people  
  
You can pawn it off on kings and queens  
And those behind the curtain  
Say one can't make a difference  
In a world so full of hurting  
But I believe the remedy  
Starts right here with you and me  
  
People loving people  
That's the enemy of everything that's evil  
Ain't no quick fix at the end of a needle  
It's just people loving people  
It's just people loving people  
It's just people loving people

His eyes are cold and restless  
And His wounds have almost healed  
And she'd give half of Texas  
Just to change the way he feels  
'Cause she knows his love's in Tulsa  
And she knows he's gonna go  
But it ain't no woman flesh and blood  
It's that damned old rodeo  
  
Well it's bulls and blood  
It's dust and mud  
It's the roar of a Sunday crowd  
It's the white in his knuckles  
The gold in his buckle  
He'll win the next go 'round  
It's boots and chaps  
It's cowboy hats  
It's spurs and latigo  
It's the ropes and the reins  
And the joy and the pain  
And they call the thing rodeo  
  
She does her best to hold him  
When his love comes to call  
But his need for it controls him  
And her back's against the wall  
And it's "So long girl, I'll see you."  
When it's time for him to go  
You know the woman wants her cowboy  
Like he wants his rodeo  
  
Well, it's bulls and blood  
It's dust and mud  
It's the roar of a Sunday crowd  
It's the white in the knuckles  
The gold in the buckle  
He'll win the next go 'round  
It's boots and chaps  
It's cowboy hats  
It's spurs and latigo  
It's the ropes and the reins  
And the joy and the pain  
And they call the thing rodeo  
  
It'll drive a cowboy crazy  
It'll drive the man insane  
And he'll sell off everything he owns  
Just to pay to play her game  
And a broken home and some broken bones  
Is all he'll have to show  
For all the years that he spent chasin'  
This dream they call rodeo  
  
Well, it's bulls and blood  
It's dust and mud  
It's the roar of a Sunday crowd  
It's the white in them knuckles  
The gold in the buckle  
He'll win the next go 'round  
It's boots and chaps  
It's cowboy hats  
It's spurs and latigo  
It's the ropes and the reins  
And the joy and the pain  
And they call the thing rodeo  
It's the broncs and the blood  
It's the steers and the mud  
And they call the thing rodeo

Well I'm shameless  
When it comes to loving you,  
I'll do anything you want me to,  
I'll do anything at all.  
  
And I'm standing  
Here for all the world to see,  
Oh, baby that's what's left of me,  
I don't have very far to fall.  
  
You know now I'm not a man who's ever been  
Insecure about the world I've been living in.  
I don't break easy, I have my pride,  
But if you need to be satisfied  
  
I'm shameless.  
Honey, I don't have a prayer.  
Every time I see you standing there  
I go down upon my knees.  
  
And I'm changing,  
Swore I'd never compromise,  
Oh, but you convinced me otherwise.  
I'll do anything you need.  
  
You see in all my life I've never found  
What I couldn't resist, what I couldn't turn down.  
I could walk away from anyone I ever knew,  
But I can't walk away from you.  
  
I have never had anything have this much control on me.  
I've worked too hard to call my life my own.  
And I've made myself a world, and it's worked so perfectly,  
But it sure won't now, I can't refuse,  
I've never had so much to lose.  
And I'm shameless...  
  
You know it should be easy for a man who's strong  
To say he's sorry or admit when he's wrong.  
I've never lost anything I ever missed,  
But I've never been in love like this.  
It's out of my hands.  
  
I'm shameless.  
I don't have the power now,  
And I don't want it anyhow,  
So I gotta let it go.  
  
And I'm shameless.  
Shameless as a man can be.  
You could make a total fool of me.  
I just wanted you to know  
That I'm shameless.

She's sun and rain, she's fire and ice  
A little crazy but it's nice  
And when she gets mad, you best leave her alone  
'Cause she'll rage just like a river  
Then she'll beg you to forgive her  
She's every woman that I've ever known  
  
She's so New York and then L.A.  
And every town along the way  
She's every place that I've never been  
She's making love on rainy nights  
She's a stroll through Christmas lights  
And she's everything I want to do again  
  
It needs no explanation  
'Cause it all makes perfect sense  
When it comes down to temptation  
She's on both sides of the fence  
  
No it needs no explanation  
'Cause it all makes perfect sense  
When it comes down to temptation  
She's on both sides of the fence  
  
She's anything but typical  
She's so unpredictable  
Oh but even at her worst she ain't that bad  
She's as real as real can be  
And she's every fantasy  
Lord she's every lover that I've ever had  
And she's every lover that I've never had

He followed her to work this morning  
He'd never seen that dress before  
She seemed to sail right through  
Those dark clouds forming  
That he knows he's headed for  
After seven years of marriage  
He wanted out  
Now after seven months of freedom  
It's clear that there's no doubt  
She's gonna make it  
And he never will  
He's at the foot of the mountain  
And she's over that hill  
He's sinkin' at sea  
And her sails are filled  
She's gonna make it  
And he never will  
And you know it's not like she's forgot about him  
She's just dealing with the pain  
And the fact that she's survived so well without him  
You know it's driving him insane  
And the crazy thing about it  
Is she'd take him back  
But the fool in him that walked out  
Is the fool who just won't ask  
She's gonna make it  
And he never will  
He's at the foot of the mountain  
And she's over that hill  
He's sinkin' at sea  
And her sails are filled  
She's gonna make it  
And he never will  
She's gonna make it  
He never will

Silent night, holy night  
All is calm, all is bright  
'Round your virgin, mother and child  
Holy infant so tender and mild  
Sleep in heavenly peace  
Sleep in heavenly peace  
  
Silent night, holy night  
Shepherds, quake at the sight  
Glory streams from heaven afar  
Heavenly hosts sing hallelujah  
Christ the Savior is born  
Christ the Savior is born  
  
Recitation  
Silent night, holy night  
All is calm, all is bright  
'Round yon virgin, mother and child  
Holy infant so infant and mild  
Sleep in heavenly peace  
Sleep in heavenly peace

City sidewalks,  
Busy sidewalks  
Dressed in holiday style  
In the air there's a  
Feeling like Christmas  
Children laughing,  
People passing  
Meeting smile after smile  
And on every  
Street corner you hear  
Silver bells,  
Silver bells  
It's Christmas time in the city  
Ring-a-ling,  
Hear them ring  
Soon it will be Christmas day  
  
Strings of street lights  
Even stop lights  
Blink a bright red and green  
As the shoppers rush home  
With their treasures  
Hear the snow crunch  
See the kids bunch  
This is Santa's big scene  
And above all the  
Bustle you hear  
  
Silver bells, silver bells  
It's Christmas time in the city  
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring  
Soon it will be Christmas day

He could see the storm clouds rollin' across the hill  
He barely beat the rain in from the field  
And between the backdoor slammin' she heard him say  
"Damn this rain and damn this wasted day"  
But she'd been waitin' for this day for oh so long  
She was standin' in the kitchen with nothin' but her apron on  
And in disbelief he stood and he stared a while  
When their eyes met, they both began to smile  
  
Somewhere other than the night  
She needs to hear I love you  
Somewhere other than the night  
She needs to know you care  
She wants to know she's needed  
She needs to be held tight  
Somewhere other than the night  
  
They spent the day wrapped up in a blanket  
On the front porch swing  
He'd come to realize he'd neglected certain things  
And there are times she feels alone even by his side  
It was the first time she ever saw him cry  
  
Somewhere other than the night  
She needs to hear I love you  
Somewhere other than the night  
She needs to know you care  
She wants to know she's needed  
She needs to be held tight  
Somewhere other than the night  
  
To know she's needed  
She needs to be held tight  
Somewhere other than the night

Cody: (shouting) Alright, now.  
  
Cody: Oh, Charlie, I know you I want a big one  
You we're out here mowing all that lawn  
I got you there walking out the door  
And I don't ever hear your voice again  
I guess you're not taking your things away  
Seem like I never die  
Oh, I was singing "Lump", if I played the same old song  
I can look at the mirror instead  
I know I got my radio and I'm walking the line  
You've got something like a donut when I should find  
But I got nothing here I said I'm walking the line  
Charlie, can you bring it in  
  
Both:  
Who ever said it's like Wayne's world  
Don't know what I'm talking about  
I got you walking out the door  
Charlie trying to figure me out  
I know life's so funny  
There's more to my dummy  
Than how much I could say  
I gotta make a little dime for the big time  
Charlie, can you bring it in  
  
Charlie:  
I got some money I payed at the restaurant  
I told me that I wanna cry  
I've got the stereo blasting  
I've got my next TRO, rock music, and song requests  
I cried to called you on the phone and I got lost and drunk  
I guess you keep cleaning the room  
I've been reading my old books all day long, but you don't ever look at me  
I know your got your radio and you're walking the line  
I got something like a donut when I should find  
But you got nothing here I said I'm walking the line  
Cody, can you bring it in  
  
Both:  
Who ever said it's like Wayne's world  
Don't know what I'm talking about  
I got you walking out the door  
Cody trying to figure you out  
I know life is funny  
There's more to my dummy  
Than how much I could say  
I gotta make a little dime for the big time  
Charlie, can you bring it in  
  
Both:  
Who ever said it's like Wayne's world  
Don't know what I'm talking about  
I got you walking out the door  
Charlie trying to figure me out  
I know life is funny  
There's more to my dummy  
Than how much I could say  
I gotta make a little dime for the big time  
Charlie, can you bring it in  
  
Both:  
Let's make a little dime for the big time  
Charlie, can you bring it in

We call them cool  
Those hearts that have no scars to show  
The ones that never do let go  
And risk it the tables being turned  
  
We call them fools  
Who have to dance within the flame  
Who chance the sorrow and the shame  
That always come with getting burned  
  
But you got to be tough when consumed by desire  
'Cause it's not enough just to stand outside the fire  
We call them strong  
Those who can face this world alone  
Who seem to get by on their own  
Those who will never take the fall  
  
We call them weak  
Who are unable to resist  
The slightest chance love might exist  
And for that forsake it all  
  
They're so hell bent on giving, walking a wire  
Convinced it's not living if you stand outside the fire  
  
[Chorus:]  
Standing outside the fire  
Standing outside the fire  
Life is not tried it is merely survived  
If you're standing outside the fire  
  
There's this love that is burning  
Deep in my soul  
Constantly yearning to get out of control  
Wanting to fly higher and higher  
I can't abide standing outside the fire  
  
[Chorus x2]

I've been out on this highway of heartache  
Hopin' that somewhere down the line  
I could find someday who  
Could rev me like you do  
So grab onto my wheel  
And I'll be fine  
Take the keys to my heart  
And drive me crazy  
I've been runnin' on empty way too long  
Honey you got the touch  
That heats my motor up  
Take the keys to my heart  
And drive it home  
I don't know where this road is gonna lead us  
But what a beautiful night for a drive  
Baby put your mind at ease  
Drop the top and feel the breeze  
Just follow all the signs to paradise  
Take the keys to my heart  
And drive me crazy  
I've been runnin' on empty way too long  
All that work under the hood  
Sure has got it runnin' good  
Take the keys to my heart  
And drive it home  
Tonight we've gonna set these wheels on fire  
And find out just how far this thing will go  
Honey we don't need no map  
'Cause where we are is where it's at  
Take the keys to my heart  
And drive it home  
Baby makes my motor yearn  
I love to feel that rubber burn  
Take the keys to my heart  
And drive it home  
Drive it home

He's got a split finger wrap  
And his rope's pulled way too tight  
He's got a lunatic smile  
'Cause he's really drawn deep tonight  
  
He's got a fever, fever, fever, fever  
Grab a hold-a anythin' and hold on tight  
It hits you like a venom from a rattlesnake bite  
We're all here 'cause he's not all there tonight  
  
He takes one last breath  
And time turns inside out  
Then the gate busts open  
To the world he dreams about  
  
He's got a fever, fever, fever, fever  
Stick a rope on anything ?cause he don't care  
He'd even take a ride in an electric chair  
We're all here 'cause he's not all there tonight  
  
He says it's really kind of simple  
Keep your mind in the middle  
While your butt spins 'round and 'round  
Take heed to Sankey's preachin'  
Keep liftin' and reachin'  
And ridin' like there ain't no clowns  
  
What he loves might kill him  
But he's got no choice  
He's a different breed  
With a voice down deep inside  
That's screamin' he was born to ride  
  
He's got a fever, fever, fever, fever  
Fever makes you crazy 'cause it makes no sense  
Like runnin' from your shadow out of self-defense  
But he won't run and baby he can't hide  
He thinks the odds are even leavin' one hand tied  
He gets so tired of hangin' on so tight  
I know you think he's crazy, well I think you're right  
We're all here 'cause he's not all there  
That's right!

A poor orphan girl named Maria  
Was walking to market one day  
She stopped for a rest by the roadside  
Where a bird with a broken wing lay  
A few moments passed till she saw it  
For it's feathers were covered with sand  
But soon clean and wrapped it was traveling  
In the warmth of Maria's small hand  
  
She happily gave her last peso  
On a cage made of rushes and twine  
She fed it loose corn from the market  
And watched it grow stronger with time  
  
Now the Christmas Eve service was coming  
And the church shone with tinsel and light  
And all of the townfolk brought presents  
To lay by the manger that night  
There were diamonds and incense and perfumes  
In packages fit for a king  
But for one ragged bird in a small cage  
Maria had nothing to bring  
  
She waited till just before midnight  
So no one could see her go in  
And crying she knelt by the manger  
For her gift was unworthy of Him  
  
Then a voice spoke to her through the darkness  
Maria, what brings you to me  
If the bird in the cage is your offering  
Open the door, let me see  
Though she trembled, she did as he asked her  
And out of the cage the bird flew  
Soaring into the rafters  
On a wing that had healed good as new  
  
Just then the midnight bells rang out  
And the little bird started to sing  
A song that no words could recapture  
Whose beauty was fit for a king  
  
Now Maria felt blessed just to listen  
To that cascade of notes sweet and long  
As her offering was lifted to heaven  
By the very first nightingale's song

That night will live forever  
Their first time to lie together  
They were finally where desire dared them to go  
Both belonging to another  
But longing to be lovers  
Promising each other that the night will only know  
Parked on some old backstreet  
They laid down in the back seat  
And fell into the fire down below  
But they would pay for their deceiving  
For a deadly web was weaving  
Why they picked that spot that evening  
Lord, the night will only know  
Well within the innuendos  
Just outside the steamy windows  
The night was shattered by a woman's scream  
Motionless and frightened  
The grip of fate had tightened  
And with trembling hands they wiped away the steam  
They saw a woman pleading  
Stumbling, begging and retreating'  
Til she became the victim of her foe  
And they watched her fall in silence  
To save their own alliance  
But the reason for the violence  
Just the night will only know  
And every paper ran the story  
She was stripped of all her glory  
And the told exactly how the woman died  
Abandoned and forsaken  
Too many pills were taken  
And they ruled the woman's death a suicide  
Bound by their behavior  
They could have been her savior  
Now guilt becomes the endless debt they owe  
But another crime was committed  
And it's never been admitted  
Have the guilty been acquitted  
Lord, the night will only know

Oh I said a little prayer tonight before I came on stage  
I came walking past the drivers and the locals on the union wage  
I asked the good lord up in heaven, let me treat the music right  
Then I prayed that Detroit goes wild tonight  
  
Seven pickers and all our gear in a rental van  
Playing music, never sleeping and working on a neon tan  
We played the barn down in Sanford, Florida  
For Bev Roberts out in Camden Park  
We plugged it in up east at Bull Run and the place went dark  
  
Back when the old stuff was new  
Back before the buses and the hard working boys in the crew  
Well it was one big party but the business called it payin' our dues  
Back when the old stuff was new  
  
Oh the stories we could tell if it weren't for the code of the road  
About the buckboard bear creek cowboys and the grizzly rose  
You know the weather turned bad in Scottsdale  
A tornado nearly stole the show  
But we just danced in the rain and listened to the thunder roll  
  
Back when the old stuff was new  
Hats off to the KC, Opry and the Ella gurus  
It was one big party, Uncle Joe you know we owe it to you  
Back when the old stuff was new  
  
No rules, young fools, comin' from the old school  
Taking on the world alone  
Next date, can't wait, tearing up the interstate  
Every place we played was home  
Balls out, no doubt this is what it's all about  
Beggin' for a place to play  
Swingin' with our low friends, prayin' that it never ends  
Wouldn't trade a single day  
  
Back when the old stuff was new  
Back before the buses and the hard workin' boys in the crew  
It was one big party, but the papers called it payin' our dues  
Back when the old stuff was new  
  
Hey it's still one big party  
You can call it whatever you choose  
You make me feel like the old stuff is new

Moonlight on canvas, midnight and wine  
Two shadows starting to softly combine  
The picture they're painting  
Is one of the heart  
And to those who have seen it  
It's a true work of art  
  
Oh, the red strokes  
Passions uncaged  
Thundering moments of tenderness rage  
Oh, the red strokes  
Tempered and strong (Fearlessly drawn)  
Burning the night like the dawn  
  
Steam on the window, salt in a kiss  
Two hearts have never pounded like this  
Inspired by a vision  
That they can't command  
Erasing the borders  
With each brush of a hand  
  
Oh, the red strokes  
Passions uncaged  
Thundering moments of tenderness rage  
Oh, the red strokes  
Tempered and strong (Fearlessly drawn)  
Burning the night like the dawn  
  
Oh, the blues will be blue and the jealousies green  
But when love picks its shade it demands to be seen  
  
Oh, the red strokes  
Passions uncaged  
Thundering moments of tenderness rage  
Oh, the red strokes  
Tempered and strong (Fearlessly drawn)  
Burning the night like the dawn  
  
Oh, the red strokes  
Passions uncaged  
Thundering moments of tenderness rage  
Oh, the red strokes  
Tempered and strong (Fearlessly drawn)  
Burning the night like the dawn  
  
Steam on the window, salt in a kiss  
Two hearts have never pounded like this

You know a dream is like a river  
Ever changin' as it flows  
And a dreamer's just a vessel  
That must follow where it goes  
Trying to learn from what's behind you  
And never knowing what's in store  
Makes each day a constant battle  
Just to stay between the shores  
And I will sail my vessel  
'Til the river runs dry  
Like a bird upon the wind  
These waters are my sky  
I'll never reach my destination  
If I never try  
So I will sail my vessel  
'Til the river runs dry  
Too many times we stand aside  
And let the waters slip away  
'Til what we put off 'til tomorrow  
It has now become today  
So don't you sit upon the shoreline  
And say you're satisfied  
Choose to chance the rapids  
And dare to dance that tide  
And I will sail my vessel  
'Til the river runs dry  
Like a bird upon the wind  
These waters are my sky  
I'll never reach my destination  
If I never try  
So I will sail my vessel  
'Til the river runs dry  
There's bound to be rough waters  
And I know I'll tke soome falls  
With the good Lord as my captain  
I can make it through them all  
And I will sail my vessel  
'Til the river runs dry  
Like a bird upon the wind  
These waters are my sky  
I'll never reach my destination  
If I never try  
So I will sail my vessel  
'Til the river runs dry  
Lord, I will sail my vessel  
'Til the river runs dry  
Yeah

She sits among the pieces of broken glass and photographs  
Reluctantly releases the last of what was her past  
It struck without a warning or did she just ignore the signs  
In those dark clouds forming behind her silver lines.  
  
Then the door it slammed like thunder and the tears they fell like rain.  
And the warnings from her family whirl like a hurricane.  
Oh, she's drowning in emotions and she cannot reach the shore.  
She's alive but can she survive the storm.  
  
A broken jewel box dancer lies in pieces down the hall.  
She's finding out the answers don't change nothing at all.  
It's time that she stopped searching for who's to blame or what went wrong.  
The only thing for certain is he's gone,  
she's got to move on.  
  
Then the door it slammed like thunder and the tears they fell like rain.  
And the warnings from her family whirl like a hurricane.  
She's drowning in emotions and she cannot reach the shore.  
She's alive but can she survive the storm.  
  
Someday days just roll on by without a gray cloud in the sky.  
She keeps telling herself, "I will make it on my own".  
And her friends they've all gone back to their lives,  
Thinking she will be alright,  
As she races through the night to make it home.  
  
The door it slams like thunder and the tears they fall like rain.  
And the warnings from her family whirl like a hurricane.  
Oh, she's drowning in emotions and she cannot reach the shore.  
She's alive but can she survive the storm.

Three thirty in the morning  
Not a soul in sight  
The city's lookin' like a ghost town  
On a moonless summer night  
Raindrops on the windshield  
There's a storm movin' in  
He's headin' back from somewhere  
That he never should have been  
And the thunder rolls  
And the thunder rolls  
  
Every light is burnin'  
In a house across town  
She's pacin' by the telephone  
In her faded flannel gown  
Askin' for miracle  
Hopin' she's not right  
Prayin' it's the weather  
That's kept him out all night  
And the thunder rolls  
And the thunder rolls  
  
The thunder rolls  
And the lightnin' strikes  
Another love grows cold  
On a sleepless night  
As the storm blows on  
Out of control  
Deep in her heart  
The thunder rolls  
  
She's waitin' by the window  
When he pulls into the drive  
She rushes out to hold him  
Thankful he's alive  
But on the wind and rain  
A strange new perfume blows  
And the lightnin' flashes in her eyes  
And he knows that she knows  
And the thunder rolls  
And the thunder rolls  
  
The thunder rolls  
And the lightnin' strikes  
Another love grows cold  
On a sleepless night  
As the storm blows on  
Out of control  
Deep in her heart  
The thunder rolls

Yes, she's my lady luck  
Hey, I'm her wild card man  
Together we're buildin' up a real hot hand  
We live out in the country  
Hey, she's my little queen of the South  
Yeah, we're two of a kind  
Workin' on a full house  
  
She wakes me every mornin'  
With a smile and a kiss  
Her strong country lovin' is hard to resist  
She's my easy lovin' woman  
I'm her hard workin' man, no doubt  
Yeah, we're two of a kind  
Workin' on a full house  
  
Yea, a pickup truck is her limousine  
And her favorite dress is her faded blue jeans  
She loves me tender when the goin' gets tough  
Sometimes we fight just so we can make up  
  
Lord I need that little woman  
Like the crops need the rain  
She's my honeycomb and I'm her sugar cane  
We really fit together  
If you know what I'm talkin' about  
Yeah, we're two of a kind  
Workin' on a full house  
  
This time I found a keeper, I made up my mind  
Lord the perfect combination is her heart and mine  
The sky's the limit, no hill is too steep  
We're playin' for fun, but we're playin' for keeps  
  
So draw the curtain, honey  
Turn the lights down low  
We'll find some country music on the radio  
I'm yours and you're mine  
Hey, that's what it's all about  
Yeah, we're two of a kind  
Workin' on a full house  
  
Lordy, mama, we'll be two of a kind  
Workin' on a full house

I was feelin' the blues  
I was watching the news  
When this fella came on the TV  
He said I'm tellin' you  
That science has proven  
That heartaches are healed by the sea  
That got me goin'  
Without even knowin'  
I packed right up and drove down  
Now I'm on a roll  
And I swear to my soul  
Tonight I'm gonna paint this town  
So bring me two pina coladas  
I want one for each hand  
Let's set sail with Captin Morgan  
And never leave dry land  
Any troubles I forgot 'em  
I buried 'em in the sand  
So bring me two pina coladas  
She said good-bye to her good timin' man  
Oh now I've gotta say  
That the wind and the waves  
And the moon winkin' down at me  
Eases my mind  
By leavin' behind  
The heartaches that love often brings  
Now I've got a smile  
That goes on for miles  
With no inclination to roam  
I've gotta say  
That I think I've gotta stay  
'Cause this is feelin' more and more like home  
So bring me two pina coladas  
Gotta have one for each hand  
Let's set sail with Captin Morgan  
Oh and never leave dry land  
Any troubles I forgot 'em  
I buried 'em in the sand  
So bring me two pina coladas  
She said good-bye to her good timin' man  
Bring me bring me two pina coladas  
I want one for each hand  
Let's set sail with Captin Morgan  
Oh and never leave dry land  
Any troubles I forgot 'em  
I buried 'em in the sand  
So bring me two pina coladas  
And say hello to her good timin' man

Just the other night a hometown football game  
My wife and I ran into my old high school flame  
And as I introduced them the past came back to me  
And I couldn't help but think of the way things used to be  
  
She was the one that I'd wanted for all times  
And each night I'd spend prayin' that God would make her mine  
And if he'd only grant me this wish I wished back then  
I'd never ask for anything again  
  
[Chorus]  
Sometimes I thank God for unanswered prayers  
Remember when you're talkin' to the man upstairs  
That just because he doesn't answer doesn't mean he don't care  
Some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers  
  
She wasn't quite the angel that I remembered in my dreams  
And I could tell that time had changed me  
Inn her eyes too it seemed  
We tried to talk about the old days  
There wasn't much we could recall  
I guess the Lord knows what he's doin' after all  
  
And as she walked away and I looked at my wife  
And then and there I thankedd the good Lord  
For the gifts in my life  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Some of God's greatest gifts are all too often unanswered...  
Some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers

Last time I saw her it was turnin' colder  
But that was years ago  
Last I heard she had moved to Boulder  
But where she's now I don't know  
But there's somethin' 'bout this time of year  
That spins my head around  
Takes me back makes me wonder  
What she's doin now  
  
'Cause what she's doin now is tearin' me apart  
Fillin' up my mind and emptyin' my heart  
I can hear her call each time the cold wind blows  
And I wonder if she knows what she's doin' now  
  
Just for laughs I dialed her old number  
But no one knew her name  
Hung up the phone sat there and wondered  
If she'd ever done the same  
I took a walk in the evenin' wind  
To clear my head somehow  
But tonight I lie here thinkin'  
What she doin' now  
  
'Cause what she's doin now is tearin' me apart  
Fillin' up my mind and emptying my heart  
I can hear her call each time the cold wind blows  
And I wonder if she knows  
  
What she's doin now is tearin' me apart  
Fillin' up my mind and emptying my heart  
I can hear her call each time the cold wind blows  
And I wonder if she knows what she's doin' now

This is a song that nobody knows  
I couldn't begin to describe how it goes  
But it makes me cry or laugh right out loud  
It's a song that I sing when there's no one around  
This is the man that nobody sees  
He wears my old clothes and he looks just like me  
Just one of the boys who gets lost in the crowd  
He's the man that I am when there's no one around  
It's four in the morning  
I'm lyin' in bed  
A tape of my failures  
Playin' inside my head  
It's heartaches and hard knocks  
And things I don't know  
I listen and I wonder  
Where will it go  
This is a glimpse of the child that's within  
He's so immature but he's still my best friend  
If he could learn how to fly he'd never touch down  
He's the kid that I am when there's no one around  
This is the dance I do every day  
I let my feet go and get carried away  
I let my soul lead and follow the sound  
It's the dance that I do when there's no one around  
It's four in the morning  
I'm lyin' in bed  
A tape of my failures  
Playin' inside my head  
It's heartaches and hard knocks  
And things I don't know  
I listen and I wonder  
Where will it go  
Thi is a song that nobody knows  
I still can't begin to describe how it goes  
But it makes me cry our laugh right out loud  
It's a song that I sing when there's no one around  
It's a song that I sing when there's no one around

The girl at the bar, she bought me a beer  
And she'd like to know if I'm new around here  
And the gal that I danced with says she's all alone  
Her friends have all left and she needs a ride home  
  
Oh and there have been others who gave me the eye  
But if they only knew they were wasting their time  
'Cause there's only one lover I can give my heart to  
But you didn't want it and you broke it in two  
  
(So tell me) which one of them will you be tonight  
Oh which one will hold me in your arms so tight  
I've forgotten what's wrong, given up on what's right  
(Tell me) which one of them will you be tonight  
  
So I'll just smile and pretend and she'll never know  
Who she's up against when she's holdin' me close  
You're all that I want, girl, your all that I need  
And when I close my eyes, honey you're all that I see  
  
(So tell me) which one of them will you be tonight  
Oh which one will hold me in your arms so tight  
I've forgotten what's wrong, given up on what's right  
(Tell me) which one of them will you be tonight

Johnny grew up  
On the dark side of the law  
Livin' in the shadow  
Of the light he never saw  
Rosie came 'round  
In the way that true love does  
Just when you're lookin' elsewhere  
For the thing that never was  
Wild as the wind  
Wild as the wind is  
Wild as the wind is love  
Wild as the wind  
Wild as the wind is  
Wild as the wind is love  
So they team up  
And they traveled on their way  
Lookin' for forever  
For every yesterday  
She brings him hope  
In the way that Angels do  
Takin' him to heaven  
In ways he never knew  
Wild as the wind  
Wild as the wind is  
Wild as the wind is love  
Wild as the wind  
Wild as the wind is  
Wild as the wind is love  
Wild as the wind  
Every so often  
He gets a stray look in his eye  
She knows how to hold him  
Without ever askin' why  
Wild as the wind  
Wild as the wind is  
Wild as the wind is love  
Wild as the wind  
Wild as the wind is  
Wild as the wind is love  
Wild as the wind  
Wild as the wind is  
Wild as the wind is love  
Wild as the wind  
Wild as the wind is  
Wild as the wind is love

From a phone booth in Cheyenne  
I made a promise to Diane  
No more rodeos  
I'd gone my last go 'round  
  
The same promise that I made  
In San Antone and Santa Fe  
But tonight I saddled up  
And let her down  
  
Wild horses keep draggin' me away  
And I'll lose more than I'm gonna win someday  
Wild horses just stay wild  
And her heart is all I break  
Wild horses keep draggin' me away  
  
She'll watch me drive around her block  
Gettin' courage up to stop  
To make her one more promise  
That I can't keep  
  
The way I love the rodeo  
I guess I should let her go  
Before I hurt her more  
Than she loves me  
  
Wild horses keep draggin' me away  
And I'll lose more than I'm gonna win someday  
Wild horses just stay wild  
And her heart is all I break  
Wild horses keep draggin' me away  
Wild horses keep draggin' me away  
And I'll lose more than I'm gonna win someday  
Wild horses just stay wild  
And her heart is all I break  
Wild horses keep draggin' me away

January's always bitter  
But Lord, this one beats all  
The wind ain't quit for weeks now  
And the drifts are ten feet tall  
I been all night drivin' heifers  
Closer in to lower ground  
Then I spent the mornin' thinkin'  
'Bout the ones the wolves pulled down  
Charlie Barton and his family  
Stopped today to say goodbye  
He said the bank was takin' over  
The last few years were just too dry  
And I promised that I'd visit  
When they found a place in town  
Then I spent a long time thinkin'  
'Bout the ones the wolves pull down  
Lord, please shine a light of hope  
On those of us who fall behind  
And when we stumble in the snow  
Could you help us up while there's still time  
Well, I don't mean to be complainin'  
LordYou've always seen me through  
And I know you got your reasons  
For each and every thing you do  
But tonight outside my window  
There's a lonesome, mournful sound  
And I just can't keep from thinkin'  
'Bout the ones the wolves pull down  
Oh Lord, keep me from bein'  
The one the wolves pull down

It's one am  
And he's still not in  
You wonder when enough's enough  
'Cause this ain't new  
But what do you do  
When you can't help who you love  
  
So you drive to town  
And you ask around  
Scared of what you're thinking of  
Has he been hurt  
Has be been with her  
'Cause you can't help who you love  
  
You hear the voices calling  
As you walk among the fallen and betrayed  
And you know it's gonna break you  
Still you follow where it takes you anyway  
'Cause you ain't got no say  
It's a long ride home  
When you're all alone  
'Cause you can't help who you love  
  
You hear the voices calling  
As you walk among the fallen and betrayed  
And you know it's gonna break you  
Still you follow where it takes you anyway  
'Cause you ain't got no say  
You should leave  
But I believe  
You can't help who you love  
  
You can't help who you love

This is how it seems to me  
Life is only therapy  
Real expensive  
And no guarantee  
So I lie here on the couch  
With my heart hanging out  
Frozen solid with fear  
Like a rock in the ground  
Woman you move me  
You give me courage I didn't  
know I had  
You move me on  
I can't go with you  
And stay where I am  
So you move me on  
This is how love was to me  
I could look and not see  
Going through the emotions  
Not knowin' what they mean  
And it scared me so much  
That I just wouldn't budge  
I might have stayed there forever  
If not for your touch  
Oh but you move me  
Out of myself and into the fire  
You move me  
Now I'm burning with love  
And with hope and desire  
How you move me  
You go whistling in the dark  
Making light of it  
Making light of it  
And I follow with my heart  
Laughing all the way  
Oh 'cause you move me  
You get me dancing and you  
make me sing  
You move me  
Now I'm taking delight  
In every little thing  
How you move me
