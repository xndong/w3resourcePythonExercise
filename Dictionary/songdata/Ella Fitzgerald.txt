A fine romance, with no kisses  
A fine romance, my friend this is  
We should be like a couple of hot tomatoes  
But you're as cold as yesterday's mashed potatoes  
A fine romance, you won't nestle  
A fine romance, you won't wrestle  
I might as well play bridge  
With my old maid aunt  
I haven't got a chance  
This is a fine romance  
  
A fine romance, my good fellow  
You take romance, I'll take jello  
You're calmer than the seals  
In the arctic ocean  
At least they flap their fins  
To express emotion  
A fine romance with no quarrels  
With no insults and all morals  
I've never mussed the crease  
In your blue serge pants  
I never get the chance  
This is a fine romance

I was a stranger in the city  
Out of town were the people i knew  
I had that feeling of self-pity  
What to do, what to do, what to do  
The outlook was decidedly blue  
  
But as i walked through the foggy streets alone  
It turned out to be the luckiest day i've known  
  
A foggy day, in London town  
Had me low, had me down  
I viewed the morning, with much alarm  
British museum, had lost its charm  
  
How long i wondered,  
Could this thing last  
But the age of miracles, hadn't past  
For suddenly, i saw you there  
And through foggy London town,  
The sun was shining everywhere  
  
For suddenly, i saw you there  
And through foggy London town,  
The sun was shining everywhere  
  
Everywhere  
Everywhere  
Everywhere

I don't know what day it is  
Or if it's dark or fair  
Somehow, that's just the way it is  
And I don't really care  
  
I go to this or that place  
I seem alive and well  
My head is just a hat place  
My breast an empty shell  
And I've a faded dream to sell  
  
All alone, all at sea  
Why does nobody care for me?  
When there's no love to hold my love  
Why is my heart so frail?  
Like a ship without a sail.  
  
Out on the ocean,  
Sailors can use a chart  
I'm on the ocean  
Guided by just a lonely heart  
  
Still alone, still at sea  
Still there's no one to care for me  
When there's no hand to hold my hand  
Life is a loveless tale  
For a ship without a sail  
  
Still alone, still at sea  
Still there's no one to care for me  
When there's no hand to hold my hand  
Life is a loveless tale  
For a ship without a sail

A-Tisket A-Tasket  
A green and yellow basket  
I bought a basket for my mommie  
On the way I dropped it  
I dropped it, I dropped it  
Yes on the way I dropped it  
A little girlie picked it up  
And took it to the market  
She was truckin' on down the  
Avenue without a single thing to do  
She was peck, peck, peckin' all around  
When she spied it on the ground  
A-Tisket A-Tasket  
She took my yellow basket  
And if she doesn't bring it back  
I think that I shall die  
(Was it red?)  
No, no, no, no  
(Was it brown?)  
No, no, no, no  
(Was it blue)  
No, no, no, no  
Just a little yellow basket  

Sad times, may follow your tracks  
Bad times, may bar you from Sak's  
At times, when Satan in slacks  
Breaks down your self control  
  
Maybe, as often it goes  
Your Abie, may tire of his rose  
So baby, this rule I propose  
Always have an ace in the hole

What can I say, dear, after I say I'm sorry?  
What can I do to prove it to you I'm sorry?  
I didn't mean to ever be mean to you  
If I didn't care, I wouldn't feel like I do  
  
I was all wrong, but right or wrong I don't blame you  
Why should I take somebody like you and shame you?  
I know that I made you cry and I'm so sorry, dear  
So what can I say, dear, after I say I'm sorry?  
  
Tell me, baby  
What can I say, dear, after I say I'm sorry, so, so sorry?  
What can I do to prove it to you I'm sorry?  
Oh, I didn't mean to ever be mean to you  
If I didn't care, I wouldn't feel like  
Oh, I wouldn't feel like I do, do, do  
  
I was all wrong, but right or wrong I don't blame you, no, no, no, no  
Why should I take somebody like you and shame you?  
I know that I made you cry and I'm so sorry, dear  
Sorry I made you cry, boo hoo hoo hoo  
Sorry I made you cry

Come on and hear (2x), alexander's ragtime band,  
Come on and hear (2x), it's the best band in the land!  
They can play a bugle call like you never heard before,  
So natural that you want to go to war--  
That's just the bestest band what am, honey lamb!  
Come on along (2x), let me take you by the hand  
Up to the man (2x), who's the leader of the band,  
And if you want to hear the swanee river played in ragtime  
Come on and hear (2x), alexander's ragtime band!  

All of me, why not take all of me?  
Baby, can't you see I'm no good without you?  
Take my lips, I'll never use them  
Take my arms, I want to lose them  
  
Your goodbye left me with eyes that cry  
Tell me how can I go on, dear, without you?  
You took the part that once was my heart  
So why not take all of me?  
  
All of me, why not take all of me?  
Can't you see I'm no good without you?  
Take my lips, I want to lose 'em  
Take my arms, I'll never use them  
  
Your g-g-goodbye left me with eyes that cry  
How can I go on, dear, without you?  
You took the part that once was my heart  
So why not take all of me?  
  
Come on and take, take all of me

All too soon  
We had to part  
The moment you had touched my heart  
And with you went my dream  
  
All too soon  
All too sweet  
Was our affair  
And you put all the sweetness there  
  
What a shame that it's gone  
All too soon  
I knew the strange delights  
That only you in love could bring  
  
And as I reached the heights  
The bottom fell from everything  
You should know as well as I  
Our love deserves another try  
  
For we whispered goodbye  
All too soon  
Too soon

I'll be loving you always  
With a love that's true always.  
When the things you've planned  
Need a helping hand,  
I will understand always.  
  
Always.  
  
Days may not be fair always,  
That's when I'll be there always.  
Not for just an hour,  
Not for just a day,  
Not for just a year,  
But always.  
  
I'll be loving you, oh always  
With a love that's true always.  
When the things you've planned  
Need a helping hand,  
I will understand always.  
  
Always.  
  
Days may not be fair always,  
That's when I'll be there always.  
Not for just an hour,  
Not for just a day,  
Not for just a year,  
But always.  
  
Not for just an hour,  
Not for just a day,  
Not for just a year,  
But always.

We meet and the angels sing  
The angels sing the sweetest song I've ever heard  
You speak and the angels sing  
Or am I reading music into every word?  
  
Suddenly the setting is strange  
I can see water and moonlight beaming  
Silver waves that break on some undiscovered shore  
Then suddenly I see it all change  
Long winter nights with the candles gleaming  
Through it all your face that I adore  
  
You smile and the angels sing  
And though it's just a gentle murmur at the start  
We kiss and the angels sing  
And leave their music ringing in my heart

Times have changed  
And we've often rewound the clock  
Since the Puritans got a shock  
When they landed on Plymouth Rock.  
But today, any shock they should try to stand,  
'Stead of landing on Plymouth Rock,  
Plymouth Rock would land on them.  
  
In olden days a glimpse of stocking  
Was looked on as something shocking  
Now, heaven knows, anything goes  
  
Good authors too who once knew better words  
Now only use four letter words writing  
Prose  
Anything goes  
  
The world has gone mad today  
And good's bad today  
And black's white today  
And day's night today  
When most guys today that women prize today  
Are just silly gigolos  
  
And though I'm  
Not a great romancer  
I know what I'm bound to answer  
When you propose, anything goes

Oh, it really wasn't my intention  
To disregard convention  
It was just an impulse  
That had to be obeyed  
Though it seems convention we've been scorning  
I'll still not go in mourning  
Though my reputation  
Is blemished, I'm afraid  
With just one kiss  
What heaven, what rapture, what bliss  
Honestly, I thought you wouldn't  
Naturally, you thought you couldn't  
And probably we shouldn't  
But aren't you kind of glad we did?  
Actually, it all was blameless  
Nevertheless, they'll call it shameless  
So let's keep the lady nameless  
But aren't you kind of glad we did?  
Socially, I'll be an outcast  
Obviously, we dined alone  
On my good name there will be doubt cast  
With never a sign of any chaperon  
No matter how they may construe it  
Whether or not, we have to rue it  
Whatever made us do it  
Say, aren't you kind of glad we did?  
  
Whatever made us do it  
Say, aren't you kind of glad we did?

I really can't stay  
But, baby, it's cold outside  
I got to go away  
But baby, it's cold outside  
This evening has been  
Been hoping that you'd drop in  
So very nice  
I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice  
  
My mother will start to worry  
Beautiful, what's your hurry?  
And father will be pacing the floor  
Listen to the fireplace roar  
So really I'd better scurry  
Beautiful, please don't hurry  
Well, maybe just a half a drink more  
Put some records on while I pour  
  
The neighbors might think  
But baby, it's bad out there  
Say, what's in this drink?  
No cabs to be had out there  
I wish I knew how  
Your eyes are like starlight now  
To break the spell  
I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell  
  
I ought to say no, no, no, Sir  
Mind if I move in closer  
At least I'm gonna say that I tried  
What's the sense of hurting my pride?  
I really can't stay  
Oh, baby don't hold out, baby  
Ahh, but it's cold outside  
  
I simply must go  
But, baby, it's cold outside  
The answer is no  
But, baby, it's cold outside  
This welcome has been  
How lucky that you dropped in  
So nice and warm  
Look out the window at that storm  
  
My sister will be suspicious  
Gosh, your lips look delicious  
My brother will be there at the door  
Waves upon a tropical shore  
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious  
Gosh, your lips are delicious  
Well, maybe just a cigarette more  
Never such a blizzard before  
  
I've got to get home  
But, baby, you'll freeze out there  
Say, lend me a comb  
It's up to your knees out there  
You've really been grand  
I thrill when you touch my hand  
But don't you see  
How can you do this thing to me?  
  
There's bound to be talk tomorrow  
Think of my life long sorrow  
At least there will plenty implied  
If you caught pneumonia and died  
I really can't stay  
Get over that old out, baby  
Ahh, but it's cold outside  
  
Where could you be going  
When the wind is blowing and it's cold outside?  
Baby, it's cold, cold outside

Oh baby, won't you please come home?  
'Cause your mama's all alone  
I have tried in vain  
Never no more to call your name  
  
When you left, you broke my heart  
Because I never thought we'd part  
Every hour in the day you will hear me say  
Baby, won't you please come home?  
  
When you left, you broke my heart  
Because I never thought we'd part  
Every hour in the day you will hear me say  
Oh baby, my baby  
Baby, won't you please come home?  
'Cause your mama needs some lovin'  
Baby, won't you please come on home?

Won't you come along with me  
To the Mississippi  
We'll take a boat to the land of dreams  
Steam down the river, down to New Orleans  
  
The band's there to meet us  
Old friends there to greet us  
Where all the proud and elite folks meet  
Heaven on earth, they call it Basin Street  
  
Basin Street is the street  
Where the best folks always meet  
In New Orleans, land of dreams  
You'll never know how nice it seems  
Or just how much it really means  
  
Glad to be, oh yes-sire  
Where welcome's free and dear to me  
Where I can lose, lose my Basin Street Blues  
  
Basin Street, oh Basin Street  
Is the street, mama (scat)  
New Orleans, land of dreams

At any gambling casino  
From monte carlo to reno  
They tell you that a beginner  
Comes out a winner  
  
Beginner fishing for flounder  
Will catch a 17 pounder  
That's what I always heard  
And thought absurd,  
But now, I believe every word  
  
For I've got beginner's luck  
The first time that I'm in love  
I'm in love with you  
Gosh, I'm lucky  
  
I've got beginner's luck  
There never was such a smile  
Or such eyes of blue  
Gosh, I'm fortunate  
  
The thing we've begun  
Is much more than a pastime  
For this time is the one  
Where the first time is the last time  
  
I've got beginner's luck  
Lucky, through and through  
Cause the first time that I'm in love  
I'm in love with you  
  
[Bridge:]  
  
The thing we've begun  
Is much more than a pastime  
For this time is the one  
Where the first time is the last time  
  
I've got beginner's luck  
Lucky, through and through  
Cause the first time that I'm in love  
Yes, the first time that I'm in love  
Oh, the first time that I'm in love  
I'm in love with you  
I'm in love with you  
I'm in love with you  
I'm in love with you

Say, its only a paper moon  
Sailing over a cardboard sea  
But it wouldn't be make-believe  
If you believed in me  
  
Yes, it's only a canvas sky  
Hanging over a muslin tree  
But it wouldn't be make-believe  
If you believed in me  
  
Without your love  
It's a honky-tonk parade  
Without your love  
It's a melody played in a penny arcade  
  
It's a Barnum and Bailey world  
Just as phony as it can be  
But it wouldn't be make-believe  
If you believed in me

After one whole quart of brandy  
Like a daisy, I'm awake  
With no bromo-seltzer handy  
I don't even shake  
  
Men are not a new sensation  
I've done pretty well I think  
But this half-pint imitation  
Put me on the blink  
  
I'm wild again, beguiled again  
A simpering, whimpering child again  
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I  
  
Couldn't sleep and wouldn't sleep  
When love came and told me, I shouldn't sleep  
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I  
  
Lost my heart, but what of it  
He is cold I agree  
He can laugh, but I love it  
Although the laugh's on me  
  
I'll sing to him, each spring to him  
And long, for the day when I'll cling to him  
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I  
  
He's a fool and don't I know it  
But a fool can have his charms  
I'm in love and don't I show it  
Like a babe in arms  
  
Love's the same old sad sensation  
Lately I've not slept a wink  
Since this half-pint imitation  
Put me on the blink  
  
I've sinned a lot, I'm mean a lot  
But I'm like sweet seventeen a lot  
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I  
  
I'll sing to him, each spring to him  
And worship the trousers that cling to him  
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I  
  
When he talks, he is seeking  
Words to get, off his chest  
Horizontally speaking, he's at his very best  
  
Vexed again, perplexed again  
Thank god, I can be oversexed again  
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I  
  
Wise at last, my eyes at last,  
Are cutting you down to your size at last  
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - no more  
  
Burned a lot, but learned a lot  
And now you are broke, so you earned a lot  
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - no more  
  
Couldn't eat, was dispeptic  
Life was so hard to bear  
Now my heart's antiseptic  
Since you moved out of there  
  
Romance, finis. your chance, finis.  
Those ants that invaded my pants, finis.  
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - no more

I'm feeling mighty lonesome  
Haven't slept a wink  
I walk the floor and watch the door  
And in between I drink  
Black coffee  
Love's a hand me down brew  
I'll never know a Sunday  
In this weekday room  
I'm talking to the shadows  
From 1 o'clock til 4  
And lord, how slow the moments go  
When all I do is pour  
Black coffee  
Since the blues caught my eye  
I'm hanging out on Monday  
My Sunday dreams to dry  
Now a man is born to go a lovin'  
A woman's born to weep and fret  
To stay at home and tend her oven  
And drown her past regrets  
In coffee and cigarettes  
I'm moaning all the morning  
And mourning all the night  
And in between it's nicotine  
And not much heart to fight  
Black coffee  
Feelin' low as the ground  
It's driving me crazy just waiting for my baby  
To maybe come around... around  
I'm waiting for my baby  
To maybe come around  
My nerves have gone to pieces  
My hair is turning gray  
All I do is drink black coffee  
Since my man's gone away  

Once upon a time  
Before I took up smiling  
I hated the moonlight!  
Shadows of the night  
That poets find beguiling  
Seemed flat as the moonlight  
With no one to stay up for  
I went to sleep at ten  
Life was a bitter cup  
For the saddest of all men  
  
Once upon a time  
My heart was just an organ  
My life had no mission  
Now that I have you  
To be as rich as Morgan  
Is my one ambition  
Once I awoke at seven  
Hating the morning light  
Now I awake in Heaven  
And all the world's all right  
  
Blue moon you saw me standing alone  
Without a dream in my heart  
Without a love of my own  
Blue moon  
You knew just what I was there for  
You heard me saying a pray'r for  
Someone I really could care for  
And then there suddenly appeared before me  
The only one my arms will ever hold  
I heard somebody whisper "Please adore me"  
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!  
Blue moon! Now I'm no longer alone  
Without a dream in my heart  
Without a love of my own  
  
Blue moon you saw me standing alone  
Without a dream in my heart  
Without a love of my own  
Blue moon  
You knew just what I was there for  
You heard me saying a prayer for  
Someone I really could care for  
And then there suddenly appeared before me  
The only one my arms will ever hold  
I heard somebody whisper "Please adore me"  
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!  
Blue moon! Now I'm no longer alone  
Without a dream in my heart

Blue skies smilin' at me  
Nothin' but blue skies do I see  
Bluebirds singin' a song  
Nothin' but bluebirds all day long  
Never saw the sun shinin' so bright  
Never saw things goin' so right  
Noticing the days hurrying by  
When you're in love, my how they fly  
  
Blue days, all of them gone  
Nothin' but blue skies from now on  
Blue skies smilin' at me  
Nothin' but blue skies do I see  
  
Never saw the sun shinin' so bright  
Never saw things goin' so right  
Noticing the days hurrying by  
When you're in love, my how they fly  
  
Blue days, all of them gone  
Nothin' but blue skies from now on

My mama done tol' me  
When I was in pigtails  
My mama done tol' me  
A man's gonna sweet-talk and give you the big eyes  
But when the sweet-talking's done  
A man is a two-face, a worrisome thing  
Who'll leave you to sing the blues in the night  
  
Now the rain's a-fallin'  
Hear the train a-callin, "whoo-ee!"  
My mama done tol' me  
Hear that lonesome whistle blowin' 'cross the trestle, "whoo-ee!"  
My mama done tol' me  
A-whooee-ah-whooee ol' clickety-clack's  
A-echoin' back th' blues in the night  
  
The evenin' breeze'll start the trees to cryin'  
And the moon'll hide it's light  
When you get the blues in the night  
Take my word, the mockingbird'll sing the saddest kind o' song  
He knows things are wrong, and he's right  
  
From Natchez to mobile,  
From Memphis to St. Joe  
Wherever the four winds blow  
I been in some big towns  
An' heard me some big talk  
But there is one thing I know  
A man's a two-face, a worrisome thing  
Who'll leave you to sing the blues in the night  
  
The evenin' breeze'll start the trees to cryin'  
And the moon'll hide it's light  
When you get the blues in the night  
Take my word, the mockingbird'll sing the saddest kind o' song  
He knows things are wrong, and he's right  
  
From Natchez to mobile,  
From Memphis to St. Joe  
Wherever the four winds blow  
I been in some big towns  
An' heard me some big talk  
But there is one thing I know  
A man's a two-face, a worrisome thing  
Who'll leave ya to sing the blues in the night  
Yes the lonely, lonely blues in the night

Pack up all my care and woe  
Here I go, singing low  
Bye-bye, blackbird  
  
Where somebody waits for me  
Sugar's sweet and so is he  
Bye, bye, blackbird  
  
No one here can love and understand me  
Oh, what hard-luck stories they all hand me  
Make my bed, light the light, I'll arrive late tonight  
Blackbird, toot-a-lou  
  
Here I go, sing a little bye, blackbird  
Where somebody waits for me  
Sugar's sweet and so is he  
Bye, blackbird  
  
No one here can love and understand me  
Oh, what hard-luck stories they all hand me  
You'd better make my bed  
And light the light, I'll arrive late tonight  
Blackbird, bye-bye, goodbye  
  
So long blackbird, bye-bye  
Bye

Baby, take me down to Duke's place  
Wildest box in town is Duke's place  
Love that piano sound in Duke's place  
Saxes do their tricks in Duke's place  
  
Fellas swing their chicks in Duke's place  
Come on, get your kicks in Duke's place  
You find yourself a seat, and when you want to eat  
You look around and yell waiter  
  
You fill your cup chock full of dreams and drink it up  
You're jetting along with your girlie  
It's after three o'clock, but, baby, it's still early  
If you've never been to Duke's place  
Take your tootsies into Duke's place  
Life is in a spin in Duke's place

Can anyone explain the thrill of a kiss  
No! No! No!  
But when two eager lips are pressed against yours  
You'll know, yes, you'll know  
  
Can anyone explain the glow of romance  
No! No! No!  
But when you hear the phrase "It's you I adore"  
You'll know, yes, you'll know  
  
And you will find, to give love a start  
Don't think with your mind, just feel with your heart  
  
Can anyone explain the wonder of love  
No! No! No!  
But now that you and I are sharing a sigh  
We know, yes, we know  
  
And you will find, to give love a start  
Don't think with your mind, just feel with your heart  
  
Can anyone explain the wonder of love  
No! No! No!  
But now that you and I are sharing a sigh  
We know, yes, we know

Oh listen, sister,  
I love my mister man,  
And I can't tell yo' why,  
There ain't no reason  
Why I should love that man.  
It must be something that the angels done plan.  
  
Fish got to swim, birds got to fly,  
I got to love one man till I die.  
Can't help loving that man of mine.  
Tell me he's lazy, tell me he's slow,  
Tell me I'm crazy (maybe I know).  
Can't help loving that man of mine.  
When he goes away  
That's a rainy day,  
But when he comes back that day is fine,  
The sun will shine!  
He kin come home as late as kin be,  
Home without him ain't no home to me.  
Can't help loving that man of mine.  
  
My man is shiftless  
An' good for nothing too  
(He's my man just the same)  
  
He's never round here  
When there is work to do.  
He's never round here when there's working to do.  
The chimbley's smoking,  
The roof is leaking in,  
But he don't seem to care.  
He kin be happy  
With just a sip of gin.  
Ah even love him when his kisses got gin!

I took each word she said as gospel truth the way a silly little child would.  
I can't excuse it on the grounds of youth, I was no babe in the wild, wild
wood.  
She didn't mean it, I should have seen it, but now it's too late.  
I thought I'd found the girl of my dreams, now it seems, this is how the story
ends:  
  
She's gonna turn me down and say, "Can't we be friends?"  
I thought for once it couldn't go wrong, not for long, I can see the way this
ends:  
She's gonna turn me down and say, "Can't we be friends?"  
Why should I care though she gave me the air,  
  
Why should I cry, heave a sigh, and wonder why, and wonder why?  
I thought I found the gal I could trust, watta bust, this is how the story
ends:  
She's gonna turn me down and say, "Can't we be just friends?"

Night and stars above that shine so bright  
The mystery of their fading light  
That shines upon our caravan  
  
Sleep upon my shoulder as we creep  
Across the sand so I may keep  
The memory of our caravan  
  
This is so exciting  
You are so inviting  
Resting in my arms  
As I thrill to the magic charms  
  
Of you beside me here beneath the blue  
My dream of love is coming true  
Within our desert caravan!

If you're idle and lonesome too  
Don't know what to do

I don't like steaks or fancy cake  
I'm cool to ice cream too  
I have just one obsession  
I really love to chew  
  
Lollipop and chocolate drop  
Have no effect on me  
But when I have some chewin' gum  
I'm happy as can be  
  
My mama gave me a penny  
To buy some candy  
I didn't want the candy  
So I bought some chewin' gum  
(Oh, yum, yum, yum)  
I love my gum  
  
My mama gave me a nickle  
To buy a pickle  
I didn't want a pickle  
So I bought some chewin' gum  
(Oh, yum, yum, yum)  
I bought some gum  
  
Each time I find myself with a dime  
I hurry to the store  
'Cause the boy who sells me chewin' gum  
Is the one that I adore  
  
My mama gave me a quarter  
For soda water  
I know I had an order  
But I bought some chewin' gum  
(A great big steak  
Is good for some)  
But as for me I'm happy  
When I'm chewin', chewin' gum  
  
Each time I find myself with a dime  
I hurry to the store  
For the boy who sells me chewin' gum  
Is the one that I adore  
  
My mama gave me a quarter  
For soda water  
I know I had an order  
But I bought some chewin' gum  
(A great big steak  
Is good for some)  
But as for me I'm happy  
When I'm chewin', chewin', chewin' gum

Let's get away from sleigh bells  
Let's get away from snow  
Let's make a break some Christmas, dear  
I know the place to go  
  
How'd ya like to spend Christmas on Christmas Island?  
How'd ya like to spend the holiday away across the sea?  
How'd ya like to spend Christmas on Christmas Island?  
How'd ya like to hang a stocking on a great big coconut tree?  
  
How'd ya like to stay up late like the islanders do?  
Wait for Santa to sail in with your presents in a canoe  
If you ever spend Christmas on Christmas Island  
You will never stray for everyday  
Your Christmas dreams come true

Your Christmas dreams come true  
On Christmas Island your dreams come true

Why do birds suddenly appear  
Every time you are near?  
Just like me, they long to be  
Close to you  
  
Why do stars fall down from the sky  
Every time you walk by?  
Just like me, they long to be  
Close to you  
  
On the day that you were born, the angels got together  
And decided to create a dream come true  
So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair of gold  
And starlight in your eyes of blue  
  
That is why all the girls in town  
Follow you all around  
Just like me, they long to be  
Close to you  
  
On the day that you were born, the angels got together  
And decided to create a dream come true  
So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair of gold  
And starlight in your eyes of blue  
  
That is why all the girls in town  
Follow you all around  
Just like me, they long to be  
Close to you  
  
Just like me they long to be  
Close to you  
I've only just began to live close to you

I'm gonna love you, like nobody's loved you  
Come rain or come shine  
High as a mountain, deep as a river  
Come rain or come shine  
I guess when you met me  
It was just one of those things  
  
But don't you ever bet me  
'Cause I'm gonna be true if you let me  
You're gonna love me, like nobody's loved me  
Come rain or come shine  
  
We'll be happy together, unhappy together  
Now won't that be just fine  
The days may be cloudy or sunny  
We're in or out of the money  
But I'm with you always  
I'm with you rain or shine

Comes a rainstorm, put your rubbers on your feet  
Comes a snowstorm, you can get a little heat  
Comes love, nothing can be done  
  
Comes a fire, then you know just what to do  
Blow a tire, you can buy another shoe  
Comes love, nothing can be done  
  
Don't try hiding, cause there isn't any use  
You'll start sliding, when your heart turns on the juice  
  
Comes a headache, you can lose it in a day  
Comes a toothache, see your dentist right away  
Comes love, nothing can be done  
  
Comes a heatwave, you can hurry to the shore  
Comes a summons, you can hide behind the door  
Comes love, nothing can be done  
  
Comes the measles, you can quarantine a room  
Comes a mousy, you can chase it with a broom  
Comes love, nothing can be done  
  
That's all, brother, if you ever been in love  
That's all, brother, you know what I'm speaking of  
  
Comes a nightmare, you can always stay awake  
Comes depression, you may get another break  
Comes love, nothing can be done  
Comes love, nothing can be done  
Comes love, nothing can be done  
  
Comes love  
Comes love  
Comes love  
Comes love  
(fade)

The man who only lives for making money  
Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny  
Likewise the man who works for fame  
There's no guarantee that time won't erase his name  
  
The fact is, the only work that really brings enjoyment  
Is the kind that is for girl and boy-meant  
Fall in love and you won't regret it  
That's the best work of all, if you can get it  
  
Holding hands at midnight  
?neath a starry sky  
Nice work if you can get it  
And you can get it if you try  
  
Strolling with the one girl  
Sighing sigh after sigh  
Nice work if you can get it  
And you can get it if you try  
  
Just imagine someone  
Waiting at the cottage door  
Where two hearts become one  
Who could ask for anything more?  
  
Loving one who loves you  
And then taking that vow  
It?s nice work if you can get it  
And if you get it, won?t you tell me how?  
  
Just imagine someone  
Waiting at the cottage door  
Where two hearts become one  
Who could ask for anything more?  
  
Loving one who loves you  
And then taking that vow  
Nice work if you can get it

Out on the plains down near Santa Fe  
I met a cowboy ridin' the range one day  
And as he jogged along I heard him singin'  
The most peculiar cowboy song  
It was a ditty, he learned in the city  
Comma ti yi yi yeah  
Comma ti yippity yi yeah  
  
Now get along, get hip little doggies  
Get along, better be on your way  
Get along, get hip little doggies  
He trucked 'em on down that old fairway  
Singin' his Cow Cow Boogie in the strangest way  
Comma ti yi yi yeah  
Comma ti yippity yi yeah  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Now singin' his cowboy songs  
He's just too much  
He's got a knocked out western accent with a dixie  
Touch  
He was raised on local ways  
He's what you call a swingin' half breed  
Singin' his Cow Cow Booogie in the strangest way  
Comma ti yi yi yeah  
Comma ti yippity yi yeah

Crab man  
I'm talkin' about devil crabs  
1'm talkin' about devil crabs  
I'm talkin' about de food I sells  
  
She crab, she crab.  
  
Porgy  
On yo' way, brother.  
  
Crab man  
Devil crab!  
  
Maria  
Hey, crab man!  
  
Crab man  
I'm talkin' about de food I sells  
When I done talkin' about de food I sells  
Talkin' about devil crab.  
(Maria picks crab, counts out money, pays Crab mon,  
Who then leaves.)  
Now I's talkin' about yo' pocketbook  
I'm talkin' about devil crabs, she crab, she crab,  
Devil crab, I'm talkin' about de food I sells.  
(Bell chimes five times. - Looks at Porgy)

Now you say you're lonely  
You cry the long night through  
Well, you can cry me a river  
Cry me a river  
I cried a river over you  
Now you say you're sorry  
For being so untrue  
Well, you can cry me a river  
Cry me a river  
I cried a river over you  
You drove me, nearly drove me, out of my head  
While you never shed a tear  
Remember, I remember, all that you said?  
You told me love was too plebeian  
Told me you were through with me and  
  
Now you say you love me  
Well, just to prove that you do  
Come on and cry me a river  
Cry me a river  
I cried a river over you  
I cried a river over you  
I cried a river, over you  
  
You drove me, nearly drove me, out of my head  
While you never shed a tear  
Remember, I remember, all that you said?  
You told me love was too plebeian  
Told me you were through with me and  
  
Now you say you love me  
Well, just to prove that you do  
Come on and cry, cry, cry me a river  
Cry me a river  
I cried, I cried, I cried a river over you  
If my pillow talk, imagine what it would have said  
Could it be a river of tears I cried instead?  
Well you can cry me a river  
Go ahead and cry me a river  
'Cause I cried, I cried a river over you  
How I cried a river over you

You saw me crying in the chapel  
The tears I shed were tears of joy  
I know the meaning of contentment  
I am happy with the Lord  
  
Just a plain and simple chapel  
Where all good people go to pray  
I prayed the Lord that I'll grow stronger  
As I live from day to day  
  
I searched and I searched but I couldn't find  
No way on earth to find peace of mind  
  
Now I'm happy in the chapel  
Where people are of one accord  
Yes, we gather in the chapel  
Just to sing and praise the Lord  
  
You'll search and you'll search but you'll never find  
No way on earth to find peace of mind  
  
Take your troubles to the chapel  
Get down on your knees and pray  
Then your burdens will be lighter  
And you'll surely find a way

The world is lyrical  
Because a miracle  
Has brought my lover to me  
Though he's some other place, his face I see  
  
At night I creep in bed  
And never sleep in bed  
But look above in the air  
And to my greatest joy, my boy is there  
  
It his prince who walks  
Into my dreams and talks  
  
He dances overhead  
On the ceiling near my bed  
In my sight  
Through the night  
  
I try to hide in vain  
Underneath my counterpane  
There's my love  
Up above  
  
I whisper, "Go away, my lover  
It's not fair"  
But I'm so grateful to discover  
He's still there  
  
I love my ceiling more  
Since it is a dancing floor  
Just for my love  
  
I whisper, "Go away, my lover  
It's not fair"  
But I'm so grateful to discover  
He's still there  
  
I love my ceiling more  
Since it is a dancing floor  
Just for my love  
Just for my love

I'll be down to get you in a taxi honey  
Better be ready 'bout half past eight  
I mean don't be late  
Be there when the band starts playin'  
Remember when you get there honey  
Dance all over the floor  
Dance all over my shoes  
When the band plays the Jelly Roll blues  
Set 'em all alight  
  
At the darktown strutters ball  
I'll be down to get you in a push cart honey  
Better be ready 'bout half past eight  
I mean don't be late  
Be there when the band starts playin'  
  
'Member when you get there honey  
Shim sham wins them all  
Dance all over my shoes  
When the band plays the Jelly Roll's blues  
Set 'em all alight  
(At) the darktown strutters ball

Darn that dream I dream each night  
You say you love me and hold me tight  
But when I awake and you're out of sight  
Oh, darn that dream  
  
Darn your lips and darn your eyes  
They lift me high above the moonlit sky  
Then I tumble out of paradise  
Oh, darn that dream  
  
Darn that one-track mind of mine  
I can't understand that you don't care  
Just to change the mood I'm in  
I'd welcome a nice old nightmare  
  
Darn that dream and bless it too  
Without that dream I never have you  
But it haunts me and it won't come true  
Oh, darn that dream

Daydream, why do you haunt me so  
Deep in a rosy glow  
The face of my love you show  
  
Daydream, I walk along on air  
Building a castle there  
For me and my love to share  
  
Don't know the time, lordy  
I'm in a daze  
Sun in the sky, while I moon around, feeling, hazy  
  
Daydream, don't break my reverie  
Until I find that he,  
Is daydreaming just like me  
  
Daydreams, why do you haunt me so  
While I'm in this rosy glow  
Bring back my love  
Bring back my love  
Bring back my love  
To me

If I should write a book for you  
That brought me fame and fortune too  
That book would be like my heart and me  
Dedicated to you  
  
And if I should paint a picture too  
That showed the loveliness of you  
My art would be like my heart and me  
Dedicated to you  
  
To you because your love is  
The beacon that lights up my way  
To you because with you I know  
One lifetime could be just one heavenly place  
  
If I should find a twinkling star  
One half so wondrous as you are  
That star would be like my heart and me  
Dedicated to you  
  
To you because your love is  
A beacon that lights up my way  
To you because with you I know  
One lifetime could be just one heavenly place  
  
If I should find a twinkling star  
One half so wondrous as you are  
That star would be like my heart and me  
Dedicated to you

Do I want you?  
Oh my do I  
Honey, indeed I do  
  
Do I need you?  
Oh my do I  
Honey, a-deed I do  
  
I'm glad that I'm the one who found you  
That's why I'm always hangin' around you  
  
Do I love you?  
Oh my do I  
Honey, deed I do  
  
I'm glad that I'm the one who found you  
That's why I'm always hangin' around you  
  
Do I love you?  
Oh my do I  
Honey, deed I do  
  
Honey, deed I do  
  
Honey, deed I do

Do I love you do I?  
Doesn't one and one make two?  
Do I love you do I?  
Does July need a sky of blue?  
Would I miss you, would I, if you ever should go away?  
If the sun should desert the day, what would life be?  
  
Will I leave you, never?  
Could the ocean leave the shore?  
Will I worship you forever?  
Isn't heaven forevermore?  
Do I love you, do I?  
Oh my dear it's so easy to see  
Don't you know I do, don't I show you I do  
Just as you love me.  
  
Will I leave you, never?  
Could the ocean leave the shore?  
Will I worship you forever?  
Isn't heaven forevermore?  
Do I love you, do I?  
  
Oh my dear it's so easy to see  
Don't you know I do, don't I show you I do  
Just as you love me

Do nothing till you hear from me  
Pay no attention to what's said  
Why one should tear the seam of anyone's dream  
Is over my head  
  
Do nothing till you hear from me  
At least consider our romance  
If you should take the word of others you've heard  
I haven't a chance  
  
True, I've been seen with someone new  
But does that mean that I'm untrue?  
While we're apart, the words in my heart  
Reveal how I feel about you  
  
Some kiss may cloud my memory  
And other arms may hold a thrill  
But please do nothing till you hear it from me  
And you never will!

I must confess what you say is true  
I had a rendezvous with somebody new  
That's the only one I ever had  
Baby, baby, don'cha go away mad  
  
Cheatin' shows and it never goes  
You got a reason to be mad I suppose  
But she only was a passin' fad  
Baby, don't you be mad  
  
Her kind's a dime a dozen  
And that's not the kind I want  
Who'd ever dream your cousin  
Would wander into that restaurant?  
  
I understand that you feel upset  
What do you say that you forgive and forget?  
Come on and kiss me just to show you're glad  
Baby, baby, don'cha go away mad  
  
Now, her kind's a dime a dozen  
I should've passed her by  
Who'd ever dream your cousin  
Would come along and give us the eye?  
  
I understand that you feel upset  
What do you say that you forgive and forget?  
Come on and kiss me just to show you're glad  
Baby, don'cha go away mad  
  
Understand that you're quite upset  
What do you say that you forgive and forget?  
Come on and kiss me just to show you're glad  
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby  
Baby, baby, baby, don'cha go 'way mad  
Now, don'cha go away mad

April skies are in your eyes  
But, darling, don't be blue  
  
Don't cry  
Oh, honey, please  
Don't be that way  
  
Clouds in the sky  
Should never make you feel that way  
  
The rain  
Will bring the violets of May  
Tears are in vain so, honey, please, don't be that way  
  
As long as we  
See it through  
You'll have me  
I'll have you  
  
Sweetheart  
Tomorrow is another day  
Don't break my heart  
Oh, honey, please, don't be that way  
  
Don't cry  
Oh, honey, please  
Don't be that way  
  
Clouds in the skies  
Should never make you feel that way  
  
The rain  
Will bring the violets of May  
Tears in vain  
So, honey, please, don't be that way  
  
As long as we  
Will see it through  
You'll have me  
And I'll have you  
  
Sweetheart  
Tomorrow is another day  
Don't break my heart  
Oh, honey, please don't be that way  
  
Don't cry  
Don't cry, don't cry  
Oh, honey, please, don't be that way  
Oh, honey, please, don't be that way  
Clouds in the sky  
Dig those crazy sky

So don't be that way  
Dig the rain  
Pitter, pitter, pitter, pitter-patter  
Bring the violets of may  
Pitter-patter of rain drops  
Tears in vain  
Tears, tears  
So, honey, please don't be that way  
Don't be that way  
  
As long as we  
Will see it through  
Oh, baby, you'll have me  
And I'll have you  
Sweetheart  
  
Tomorrow is another day  
Tomorrow is another day  
Don't break my heart  
  
Oh, honey, please, don't be that way  
Looky here, baby, don't cry

Honey, please, don't be that way  
  
Clouds in the sky  
Oh, honey, please, don't be that way  
No, I'll never be that way

Wildcat kelley, lookin' mighty pale,  
Was standin' by the sherrif's side  
And when the sherrif said "i'm sendin you to jail,  
Wildcat raised his head and cried  
  
Oh, give me land, lots of land under starry skies above,  
Don't fence me in.  
Let me ride through the wide open country that i love,  
Don't fence me in.  
Let me be by myself in the evenin' breeze,  
Listen to the murmur of the cottonwood trees,  
Send me off forever but i ask you please,  
Don't fence me in.  
  
Just turn me loose, let me straddle my old saddle  
Underneath the western skies.  
On my cayuse, let me wander over yonder  
Till i see the mountains rise.  
  
I want to ride to the ridge where the west commences  
Gaze at the moon till i lose my senses  
I can't look at hobbles and i can't stand fences  
Don't fence me in.  
  
Wildcat kelley, back again in town,  
Was standin by his sweethearts side,  
And when his sweetheart said "come on let's settle down,

Don't fence me in.  
Let me ride through the wide open country that i love,  
Don't fence me in.

Missed the Saturday dance  
Heard they crowded the floor  
Couldn't bear it without you  
Don't get around much anymore  
  
Thought I'd visit the club  
Got as far as the door  
Couldn't bear it without you  
Don't get around much anymore  
  
Darlin', I guess my mind's more at ease  
But, nevertheless, why bring back old memories?  
  
Been invited to dates  
Might have gone, but what for?  
Couldn't bear it without you  
Don't get it around much anymore

Awfully lonesome without you  
Don't get around much anymore  
  
Yes, darlin', I guess my mind's more at ease  
But, nevertheless, why bring back old memories?  
  
Been invited to dates

Get in touch with that sundown fellow  
As he tiptoes across the sand  
He's got a million kinds of stardust  
Pick your favorite brand, and  
  
Dream, when you're feeling blue  
Dream, that's the thing to do  
Just watch the smoke rings rise in the air  
You'll find your share of memories there  
  
So dream when the day is through  
Dream, and they might come true  
Things never are as bad as they seem  
So dream, dream, dream  
  
Dream, when the day is through  
Dream, and they might come true  
Things never are as bad as they seem  
So dream, dream, dream, dream  
So dream, dream, dream

Stars shining bright above you  
Night breezes seem to whisper "I love you"  
Birds singing in the sycamore trees  
Dream a little dream of me  
  
Say nighty-night and kiss me  
Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me  
While I'm alone and blue as can be  
Dream a little dream of me  
  
Stars fading but I linger on dear  
Still craving your kiss  
I'm longing to linger till dawn dear  
Just saying this  
  
Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you  
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you  
But in your dreams whatever they be  
Dream a little dream of me  
  
Stars fading but I linger on dear  
Still craving your kiss  
I'm longing to linger till dawn dear  
Just saying this  
  
Sweet dreams, till sunbeams find you  
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you  
But in your dreams whatever they be  
Dream a little dream of me

When day is gone and night comes on  
Until the dawn what do I do?  
I clasp your hand and wander through slumber land  
Dream dancing with you  
  
We dance between a sky serene  
And fields of green sparkling with dew  
It's joy sublime whenever I spend my time  
Dream dancing with you  
  
Dream dancing  
Oh, what a lucky windfall  
Touching you, clutching you  
All the night through  
  
So say you love me, dear  
And let me make my career  
Dream dancing, dream dancing with you  
  
When day is gone and night comes on  
Until the dawn what do I do?  
I clasp your hand and wander through slumber land  
Dream dancing with you  
  
We dance between a sky serene  
And fields of green sparkling with dew  
It's joy sublime whenever I spend my time  
Dream dancing with you  
  
Dream dancing  
Oh, what a lucky windfall  
Holding you, clutching you  
All the night through  
  
So say you love me, dear  
And let me make my career  
Dream dancing, dream dancing  
With you, with you, with you

Why are my eyes always full of this vision of you  
Why do I dream silly dreams that I fear won't come true  
I long to show you the stars  
Caught in the dark of the sea  
I long to speak of my love but you don't come to me  
So I go on asking if maybe one day you'll care  
I tell my sad little dreams to the soft evening air  
I am quite hopeless it seems, two things I know how to do  
One is to dream  
Two is loving you

East of the sun and west of the moon  
We'll build a dream house of love, dear  
Near to the sun in the day  
Near to the moon at night  
We'll live in a lovely way, dear  
Living our love in pale moonlight  
  
Just you and I, forever and a day  
Love will not die, we'll keep it that way  
Up among the stars we'll find  
A harmony of life to a lovely tune  
East of the sun and west of the moon, dear  
East of the sun and west of the moon  
  
Just you and I, forever and a day  
Love will not die, we'll keep it that way  
Up among the stars we'll find  
A harmony of life to a lovely tune  
East of the sun and west of the moon, dear  
East of the sun, west of the moon  
East of the sun and west of the moon

I know too well that I'm just wasting precious time  
In thinking such a thing could be  
That you could ever care for me  
I'm sure you hate to hear  
  
That I adore you, dear  
But grant me  
Just the same  
I'm not entirely to blame  
  
For love  
You'd be so easy to love  
So easy to idolize  
All others above  
  
So worth the yearning for  
So swell to keep every home fire burning for  
We'd be so grand at the game  
So carefree together  
  
That it does seem a shame  
That you can't see  
Your future with me  
'Cause you'd be oh, so easy to love

Everytime we say goodbye, I die a little,  
Everytime we say goodbye, I wonder why a little,  
Why the Gods above me, who must be in the know.  
Think so little of me, they allow you to go.  
When you're near, there's such an air of spring about it,  
I can hear a lark somewhere, begin to sing about it,  
There's no love song finer, but how strange the change from major to  
minor,  
Everytime we say goodbye.

You left me a horse from Texas,  
A house with installments due,  
A letter with lots of x-s  
Everything but you.  
  
You left me some beans from Boston,  
A bicycle built for two,  
A memory to get lost in,  
Everything but you.  
  
Each day was so gay and so daring,  
I loved every breathtaking minute,  
For how could I know I was sharing  
A kiss without a future in it.  
  
You left me a dream to room with,  
A coffee pot from Peru,  
A knife and fork to spoon with,  
Everything but you.

I love you for sentimental reasons  
I hope you do believe me  
I'll give you my heart  
  
I love you and you alone were meant for me  
Please, give your loving heart to me  
And say we'll never part  
  
I think of you every morning  
Dream of you every night  
Darling, I'm never lonely  
Whenever you are in sight  
  
I love you for sentimental reasons  
I hope you do believe me  
I've given you my heart  
  
I love you for sentimental reasons  
I hope you do believe me  
I've given you my heart

Paradise can not refuse us  
Never such a happy pair  
  
Everybody must excuse us  
If we walk on air  
  
All the shadows now will lose us  
Lucky stars are everywhere  
  
As a happy being  
Here's what I'm foreseeing  
  
For you, for me, forever more  
It's bound to be forever more  
  
It's plain to see  
We found, by finding each other  
The love we waited for  
  
I'm yours, you're mine  
And in our hearts  
The happy ending starts  
  
What a lovely world  
This world will be  
With a world of love in store  
For you, for me, forever more  
  
What a lovely world  
This world will be  
With a world of love in store  
For you, for me, forever more

Now that we are close, no more nights morose,  
Now that we are one, the beguine has just begun.  
Now that we're side by side, the future looks so gay,  
Now we are alibied when we say...  
  
From this moment on, you for me dear  
Only two for tea dear, from this moment on,  
From this happy day, no more blue songs,  
Only whoop dee doo songs,  
  
From this moment on.  
For you've got the love i need so much,  
Got the skin i love to touch,  
Got the arms to hold me tight,  
  
Got the sweet lips to kiss me goodnight,  
From this moment on, you and i, babe,  
We'll be ridin' high, babe.  
Every care is gone, from this moment on.

Love makes me treat you the way that I do  
Gee, baby, ain't I good to you?  
There's nothing in this world too good  
For a girl so good and true  
Gee, baby, ain't I good to you?  
  
Bought you a fur coat for Christmas  
A diamond ring  
A big Cadillac car, and everything  
What makes me treat you the way that I do?  
  
Gee, baby, ain't I good to you?  
Bought you a fur coat for Christmas  
A diamond ring  
A big Cadillac car, and everything  
What makes me treat you the way that I do?  
Gee, baby, ain't I good, to you?

Georgia, Georgia  
The whole day through  
Just an old sweet song  
Keeps Georgia on my mind  
  
I'm say Georgia, Georgia  
A song of you  
Comes as sweet and clear  
As moonlight through the pines  
  
Other arms reach out to me  
Other eyes smile tenderly  
Still in peaceful dreams I see  
The road leads back to you  
  
I said Georgia  
Oh Georgia, no peace I find  
Just an old sweet song  
Keeps Georgia on my mind  
  
Other arms reach out to me  
Other eyes smile tenderly  
Still in peaceful dreams I see  
The road leads back to you  
  
Georgia, Georgia  
No peace, no peace I find  
Just this old, sweet song  
Keeps Georgia on my mind  
  
I said just an old sweet song  
Keeps Georgia on my mind

Get thee behind me, Satan  
I want to resist  
But the moon is low and I can't say "no"  
Get thee behind me  
  
Get thee behind me, Satan  
I mustn't be kissed  
But the moon is low and I may let go  
Get thee behind me  
  
Someone I'm mad about  
Is waiting in the night for me  
Someone that I mustn't see  
Satan, get thee behind me  
  
He promised to wait  
But I won't appear and he may come here  
Satan, he's at my gate  
Get thee behind me  
Stay where you are  
It's too late

I don't believe in frettin' and grievin'  
Why mess around with strife?  
I never was cut out to step and strut out  
Give me the simple life  
  
Some find it pleasant dining on pheasant  
Those things roll off my knife  
Just serve me tomatoes and mashed potatoes  
Give me the simple life  
  
A cottage small is all I'm after  
Not one that's spacious and wide  
A home that rings with joy and laughter  
And the ones you love inside  
  
Some like the high road, I like the low road  
Free from the grief and strife  
Sounds corny and seedy, but, yes, indeedy  
Give me the simple life

God rest ye merry gentlemen  
Let nothing you dismay  
Remember Christ our savior  
Was born on Christmas day  
To save us all from Satan's power  
When we were gone astray  
Oh tidings of comfort and joy  
Comfort and joy  
Oh tidings of comfort and joy  
  
From God our heavenly father  
The blessed angel came  
And unto certain shepherds  
Brought tidings of the same  
How bad in Bethlehem was born  
The son of God by name  
Oh tidings of comfort and joy  
Comfort and joy  
Oh tidings of comfort and joy  
  
Now to the Lord sing praises  
All you with in this place  
And with true love and brotherhood  
Each other now embrace  
This holy tide of Christmas  
All ever that you can face  
Oh tidings of comfort and joy  
Comfort and joy  
Oh tidings of comfort and joy

Good morning blues, blues how do you do  
Good morning blues, blues how do you do  
Babe, I feel alright but I come to worry you  
  
Baby, it's Christmas time and I want to see Santa Claus  
Baby, it's Christmas time and I want to see Santa Claus  
Don't show me my pretty baby, I'll break all of the laws  
  
Santa Claus, Santa Claus, listen to my plea  
Santa Claus, Santa Claus, listen to my plea  
Don't send me nothing for Christmas but my baby back to me

Good morning heartache  
You old gloomy sight  
Good morning heartache  
Thought we said goodbye last night  
  
I turned and tossed until it seems you have gone  
But here you are with the dawn  
Wish I forget you, but you're here to stay  
It seems I met you  
When my love went away  
Now everyday I stop I'm saying to you  
Good morning heartache what's new  
  
Stop haunting me now  
Can't shake you no how  
Just leave me alone  
I've got those Monday blues  
Straight to Sunday blues  
  
Good morning heartache  
Here we go again  
Good morning heartache  
You're the one  
Who knows me well  
Might as well get use to you hanging around  
Good morning heartache  
Sit down

Goodnight my love, the tired old moon is descending,  
Goodnight my love, my moment with you now is ending.  
It was so heavenly, holding you close to me,  
It will be heavenly to hold you again in a dream,  
The stars above have promised to meet us tomorrow,  
Til then, my love, how dreary the new day will seem,  
So for the present dear, we'll have to part,  
Sleep tight my love, goodnight my love,  
Remember that you're my sweetheart.

I've been blue all day  
My man's gone away  
He left his mama cold  
For another gal, I'm told  
I've tried to treat him kind  
I thought he would be mine  
That man I hate to lose  
That's why mama's got the blues  
  
The man that I love he has left me in this town  
The man I love has gone and left me in this town  
And if it keeps on snowin' I will be Gulf Coast bound  
Mailman passed but he didn't leave no news  
The mailman's passed but he didn't leave no news  
  
I tell the world he left me cryin' those Gulf Coast blues  
These men up north honey sure do make me tired  
These men up north they surely do make me tired  
They've got a mouth full of gimme, and a handful of much obliged

Let me tell you 'bout a boy I know  
He is my baby and he lives next door  
Every morning before the sun comes up  
He brings my coffee in my favorite cup  
That's why I know, yes, I know  
Hallelujah, I just love him so  
  
When I'm in trouble and I have no friends  
I know he'll go with me until the end  
Everybody asks me how I know  
I smile and tell them he told me so  
That's why I know, yes, I know  
Hallelujah, I just love him so  
  
Now if I call him on the telephone  
And tell him that I'm all alone  
By the time I count from one to four  
I hear him on my door  
In the evening when the sun goes down  
When there is nobody else around  
He kisses me and he holds me tight  
He tells me "baby, everything's all alright"  
That's why I know, yes, I know  
Hallelujah, I just love him so

It seem like happiness is jus' a thing called Joe  
He got a smile that make the lilac want to grow  
He got a way that make the angels heave a sigh  
When they know little Joe's passing by  
  
Sometime the cabin gloomy and the table bare  
Soon he kiss me and it's Christmas everywhere  
Trouble fly away and life is easy go  
  
Does he love me good? That's all I has to know  
Seem like happiness is jus' a thing called Joe  
Seem like happiness is jus' a thing called Joe  
Little Joe, little Joe, little Joe

We want to leave you happy  
Don't want to leave you sad  
We want to leave you happy

Every woman is crying  
Crying 'bout a man  
And the way he did her wrong

Hark! The herald angels sing  
"Glory to the newborn King!"  
  
Christ by highest Heav'n adored  
Christ the everlasting Lord!  
Late in time behold Him come  
Offspring of a Virgin's womb  
Veiled in flesh the Godhead see  
Hail the incarnate Deity  
Pleased as man with man to dwell  
Jesus, our Emmanuel  
Hark! The herald angels sing  
"Glory to the newborn King!"  
  
Hail the Heav'n-born Prince of Peace!  
Hail the Son of Righteousness!  
Light and life to all He brings  
Ris'n with healing in His wings  
Mild He lays His glory by  
Born that man no more may die  
Born to raise the sons of earth  
Born to give them second birth  
Hark! The herald angels sing  
"Glory to the newborn King!"

Have yourself a merry little christmas  
Let your heart be light  
Next year all our troubles will be  
Out of sight  
Have yourself a merry little christmas  
Make the yule-tide gay  
Next year all our troubles will be  
Miles away  
Once again as in olden days  
Happy golden days of yore  
Faithful friends who are dear to us  
Will be near to us once more  
Someday soon, we all will be together  
If the fates allow  
Until then, well have to muddle through somehow  
So have yourself a merry little christmas now

Ramblin' man makes no change in me  
I'm going to ramble back to my used-to-be  
Aww, you hear me talkin' to ya  
I don't bite my tongue  
You wanna be my man?  
You gotta fetch it with you when you come  
  
Eve and Adam in a garden takin' a chance  
Adam didn't take time to get his pants  
Aww, you hear me talkin' to ya  
I don't bite my tongue  
You wanna be my man?  
You gotta fetch it with ya when you come  
  
I don't care whether they're old or young  
When the chips were down, they have trouble along  
I guess you hear me talkin' to ya  
I don't bite my tongue  
You wanna be my man?  
You gotta fetch it with ya when you come  
  
Hello sayin' true give me 6 0 9  
What takes gettin' in these  
His or mine?  
Hear me talkin' to ya  
I don't bite my tongue  
You wanna be my man?  
You gotta fetch it with you when you come

We're having a heat wave,  
A tropical heat wave,  
The temperature's rising,  
It isn't surprising,  
She certainly can can-can.  
  
She started a heat wave  
By letting her seat wave  
In such a way that  
The customers say that  
She certainly can can-can.  
  
Gee, her anatomy  
Makes the mercury  
Jump to ninety-three.  
  
We're having a heat wave,  
A tropical heat wave,  
The way that she moves  
That thermometer proves  
That she certainly can can-can.

I know a dark, secluded place  
A place where no one knows your face!  
A glass of wine, a fast embrace  
It's called Hernando's Hideaway, a-way!  
  
All you see are silhouettes  
And all you hear are castanets  
And no one cares how late it gets  
Not at Hernando's hideaway, a-way!  
  
At the Golden Finger Bowl or anyplace you go  
You will meet your Uncle Max and everyone you know  
But if you go to the spot that I am thinking of  
You will be free to gaze at me and talk of love  
Just knock three times and whisper low  
That you and I were sent by Joe  
Then strike and match and you will know  
You're in Hernando's hideaway, a-way!  
  
I know a dark, secluded place  
A place where no one ever knows your face!  
Wine is fine with a fast embrace  
Hernando's Hideaway -away!  
  
At the Golden Finger Bowl or anyplace you go  
You will meet your Uncle Max and everyone you know  
But if you go to the spot that I am thinking of  
You will be free to gaze at me and talk of love  
Just knock three times and whisper low  
That you and I were sent by Joe  
Then strike and match and you will know  
You're in Hernando's hideaway!

How can I tell you what is in my heart?  
How can I measure each and every part?  
How can I tell you how much I love you?  
How can I measure just how much I do?  
  
How much do I love you?  
I'll tell you no lie  
How deep is the ocean?  
How high is the sky?  
  
How many times a day do I think of you?  
How many roses are sprinkled with dew?  
  
How far would I travel  
To be where you are?  
How far is the journey  
From here to a star?  
  
And if I ever lost you  
How much would I cry?  
How deep is the ocean?  
How high is the sky?

Somewhere there's music  
How faint the tune  
Somewhere there's heaven  
How high the moon  
There is no moon above  
When love is far away too  
Till it comes true  
That you love me as I love you  
  
Somewhere there's heaven  
It's where you are  
Somewhere there's music  
How near, how far  
The darkest night would shine  
If you would come to me soon  
Until you will, how still my heart  
How high the moon  
  
How high the moon  
Is the name of this song  
How high the moon  
Though the words maybe wrong  
We're singin' it because you ask for it  
So we're swingin' it just for you  
  
How high the moon  
Does it touch the stars  
How high the moon  
Does it reach out to mars  
Though the words maybe wrong to this song  
We're askin' how high high high high is the moon  
  
Though the words maybe wrong to that song  
We're askin' how high high high high is the moon

'Neath the stars, at bazaars  
Often I've had to caress men  
Five or ten, dollars then, I'd collect from all those yes-men  
Don't be sad, I must add, that they meant no more than chess-men  
  
Darling, can't you see?  
'Twas for charity?  
Though these lips have made slips, it was never really serious  
Who'd have thought, I'd be brought to a state that's so delirious?  
  
I could cry salty tears  
Where have I been all these years?  
Little wow, tell me now  
How long has this been goin' on?  
  
There were chills up my spine  
And some thrills I can't define  
Listen sweet, I repeat  
How long has this been goin' on?  
  
Oh, I feel that I could melt  
Into heaven I'm hurled  
I know how columbus felt  
Finding another world  
  
Kiss me once, then once more  
What a dunce I was before  
What a break, for heaven's sake  
How long has this been goin' on?  
  
Kiss me twice, once more, thrice, make it four  
  
What a break, for heaven's sake  
How long has this been goin' on?

Ain't got the change of a nickel  
Ain't got no bounce in my shoes  
Ain't go no fancy to tickle  
  
I ain't got nothing but the blues  
Ain't got no coffee that's perking  
Ain't got no winnings to lose  
  
Ain't got a dream that is working  
I ain't got nothing but the blues  
When trumpets flare up  
  
I keep my hair up  
I just can't make it come down  
Believe me peppie,  
I can't get happy  
  
Since my ever loving baby left town  
Ain't got no rest in my slumbers  
Ain't got no feelings to bruise  
Ain't got no telephone numbers  
I ain't got nothing but the blues

I am dejected. I am depressed.  
Yet resurrected and sailing the crest.  
Why this elation, mixed with deflation?  
What explanation? I am in love.  
  
Such conflicting questions rise  
Around in my brain: Should I order cynanide  
Or order champagne?  
  
Oh, what is this sudden jolt?  
I feel like a frightened colt,  
Just hit by a thunderbolt. I am in love.  
  
I knew the odds were against me before,  
I had no flair for flaming desire,  
But since the gods gave me you to adore,  
I may lose but I refuse to fight the fire,  
  
So come and enlighten my days and never depart.  
You only can brighten the blaze that burns in my heart,  
For I am wildly in love with you,  
And so in need of a stampede of love.  
  
I knew the odds were against me before,

You only can brighten the blaze that burns in my heart,  
For I am wildly in love with you,  
And so in need of a stampede of love,  
And so in need of a stampede of love.

I've flown around the world in a plane  
I've settled revolutions in Spain  
The North Pole I have charted  
But can't get started with you  
  
Around the golf course I'm under par  
And all the movies want me to star  
I've got a house, a show place  
But I get no place with you  
  
You're so supreme, lyrics I write of you  
scheme, just for a sign of you  
dream, both day and night of you  
and what good does it do  
  
In nineteen twenty nine I sold short  
In England I'm presented at court  
But you got me so downhearted  
Because I can't get started with you  
  
You're so supreme, lyrics I write of you  
scheme, just for a sign of you  
dream, both day and night of you  
and what good does it do

In England I'm presented at court  
But you got me so downhearted  
Because I can't get started with you

I can't give you anything but love, baby.  
That's the only thing I've plenty of, baby.  
Dream a while. Scheme a while.  
I'm sure you'll find  
Happiness, and I guess  
all those things you've always pined for.  
  
Gee I'd like to see you looking swell, baby  
Diamond bracelets Woolworth's doesn't sell, baby.  
till that lucky day you know darn well, baby.  
I can't give you anything but love.  
  
(repeat the whole thing)

I cried for you  
Now, it's your turn to cry over me  
Every road has it's turning  
That's one thing you're learning  
  
I cried for you, what a fool I used to be  
But I found two eyes just a little bit bluer  
I found a heart just a little bit truer  
  
I cried for you  
Now, it's your turn to cry over me  
  
I cried, how I cried for you  
What a fool I used to be  
Oh, but I found two eyes  
Just a little bit, little bit bluer  
I found a heart just a little bit, little bit truer  
  
For I cried for you  
Now, it's your turn to cry over me  
Over me, over me

Once I was young --  
Yesterday, perhaps --  
Danced with Jim and Paul  
And kissed some other chaps.  
  
Once I was young,  
But never was naive.  
I thought I had a trick or two  
Up my imaginary sleeve.  
  
And now I know I was naive.  
I didn't know what time it was  
Then I met you.  
Oh, what a lovely time it was,  
  
How sublime it was too!  
I didn't know what day it was  
You held my hand.  
Warm like the month of May it was,  
  
And I'll say it was grand.  
Grand to be alive, to be young,  
To be mad, to be yours alone!  
Grand to see your face, feel your touch,  
  
Hear your voice say I'm all your own.  
I didn't know what year it was  
Life was no prize.  
I wanted love and here it was  
  
Shining out of your eyes.  
I'm wise,  
And I know what time it is now.  
Grand to be alive, to be young,  
  
To be mad, to be yours alone!  
Grand to see your face, feel your touch,  
Hear your voice say I'm all your own.  
I didn't know what year it was  
  
Life was no prize.  
I wanted love and here it was  
Shining out of your eyes.  
I'm wise,  
  
And I know what time it is now.

I didn't mean a word I said  
And if I hurt you I'm sorry  
I didn't mean to lose my head  
And if made you cry I'm sorry  
It was just another foolish quarrel  
Won't you end it with a kiss and  
Just remember this  
Except the time I said I love you  
I didn't mean a word I said  
I didn't mean a word I said  
  
I didn't mean a word I said  
And if I hurt you I'm so so sorry so so so sorry  
I didn't mean to lose my head  
And if made you cry I'm sorry  
It was just another foolish quarrel  
Won't you end it with a kiss and  
Just remember this  
Except the time I said I love you  
I didn't mean a word I said  
I didn't mean a word I said

My story is much too sad to be told  
But practically everything leaves me totally cold  
The only exception I know is the case  
When I'm out on a quiet spree  
Fighting vainly the old ennui  
And I suddenly turn and see your fabulous face  
  
[Chorus]  
I get no kick from champagne  
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all  
So tell me, why should it be true  
That I get a kick out of you?  
Some get a kick from cocaine  
I'm sure that if I took even one sniff  
That would bore me terrifically too  
But I get a kick out of you  
  
I get a kick every time I see you standing there before me  
I get a kick though it's clear to see you obviously don't adore me  
I get no kick in a plane  
Flying too high with some guy in the sky  
Is my idea of nothing to do  
But I get a kick out of you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I get a kick out of you

I got a guy  
He don't dress me in sable  
He looks nothing like Gable  
But he's mine  
And I think he's too divine  
  
I got a guy  
When he starts into pet me  
He's the sauce on spaghetti  
He's the kind  
That you can't keep off your mind  
  
I got a guy  
And he's tough  
He's just a gem in the rough  
But when I polish him up, I swear  
He'll be a Tiffany solitaire  
  
I'm riding high  
'Cause I'm happy and carefree  
There is nothing that can scare me  
'Cause I got a guy  
  
I got a guy  
And he's tough  
He's just a gem in the rough  
But when I polish him up, I swear  
He'll be a Tiffany solitaire  
  
I'm riding high  
'Cause I'm happy and carefree  
There is nothing that can scare me  
'Cause I got a guy

The poets say that all who love are blind  
But I'm in love and I know what time it is  
The good book says, "Go seek and ye shall find"  
Well, I have sought and my, what a climb it is!  
My life is just like the weather  
It changes with the hours  
When he's near I'm fair and warmer  
When he's gone I'm cloudy with showers  
An emotion like the ocean  
It's either sink or swim  
When a woman loves a man  
Like I love him  
Never treats me sweet and gentle, the way he should  
I got it bad and that ain't good  
My poor heart is sentimental, not made of wood  
I got it bad and that ain't good  
But when the weekend's over and Monday rolls around  
I end up like I started out just cryin' my lil' heart out  
He don't love me like I love him  
No, nobody could, I got it bad and that ain't good  
So bad, so bad  
I got on it so bad, so bad though folks with good intentions  
Tell me to save my tears  
I'm glad, I'm mad about you, I can't live without you  
Lord above me make him love me the way he should  
Like a lonely weeping willow lost in the wood  
The things I tell my pillow  
No woman should  
I got it bad, bad so bad and that ain't good  

Days can be sunny with never a sigh  
Don't need what money can buy  
Birds in the trees sing their dayful of songs  
Why shouldn't we sing along?  
I'm chipper all the day  
Happy with my life  
How do I get that way?  
Look at what I've got:  
  
I got rhythm, I got music, I got my man  
Who could ask for anything more?  
I've got daisies in green pastures  
I've got my man  
Who could ask for anything more?  
  
Old man trouble I don't mind him  
You won't find him 'round my door  
I've got starlight  
I've got sweet dreams  
I've got my man  
Who could ask for anything more?  
  
Old man trouble, I don't mind him  
You won't find him 'round my door  
I've got starlight  
I've got sweet dreams  
I've got my man  
Who could ask for anything more?  
  
Oh, I've got rhythm  
I've got music  
I've got daisies in green pastures  
I've got starlight  
I've got sweet dreams  
I've got my man  
Who could ask for anything more?  
  
I've got rhythm, I've got rhythm

I hear music, mighty fine music  
The murmur of a morning breeze up there  
The rattle of the milkman on the stair  
  
Sure that's music, mighty fine music  
The singing of a sparrow in the sky  
The perking of the coffee right nearby  
  
That's my favorite melody  
You, my angel, phoning me  
  
I hear music, mighty fine music  
And anytime I think my world is wrong  
I get me out of bed and sing this song  
  
That's my favorite melody  
You, my angel, phoning me  
  
I hear music, mighty fine music  
And anytime I think my world is wrong  
I get me out of bed and sing this crazy song

I let a song go out of my heart  
It was the sweetest melody  
I know I lost heaven 'cause you were the song  
  
Since you and I have drifted apart  
Life doesn't mean a thing to me  
Please come back, sweet music, I know I was wrong  
  
Am I too late to make amends?  
You know that we were meant to be more than just friends, just friends  
  
I let a song go out of my heart  
Believe me, darlin', when I say  
I won't know sweet music until you return some day  
  
I let a song go out of my heart  
Believe me, darlin', when I say  
I won't know sweet music until you return some day

Every time I look down on, this timeless town  
Whether blue or gray be her skies  
Whether loud be her cheers or whether soft be her tears  
More and more do I realize that  
  
I love Paris in the spring time  
I love Paris in the fall  
I love Paris in the summer when it sizzles  
I love Paris in the winter when it drizzles  
  
I love Paris every moment  
Every moment of the year  
I love Paris  
Why, oh, why do I love Paris?  
Because my love is here

Are the stars out tonight?  
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright  
'Cause I only have eyes for you, dear  
The moon may be high  
But I can't see a thing in the sky  
'Cause I only have eyes for you.  
  
I don't know if we're in a garden  
Or on a crowded avenue  
You are here, so am I  
Maybe millions of people go by  
But they all disappear from view  
And I only have eyes for you  
I don't know if we're in a garden  
Or on a crowded avenue  
You are here, so am I  
Maybe millions of people go by  
But they all disappear from view  
And I only have eyes for you.

I took a trip on a train, and I thought about you  
I passed a shadowy lane, and I thought about you  
Two or three cars parked under the stars, a windin' stream  
Moon shining down on some little town  
And with each beam, the same old dream  
And every stop that we made, oh I thought about you  
And when I pulled down the shade, then I really felt blue  
I peaked through the crack and looked at the track  
The one goin' back to you, and what did I do?  
I thought about you  
  
There were two or three cars parked under the stars, a windin' stream  
Moon shining down on some little town  
And with each beam, the same old dream  
  
And then I peaked through the crack and I looked at that track  
The one goin' back to you, and what did I do?  
I thought about you

Strange  
How a dreary world can suddenly change  
To a world as bright as the evening star  
Queer  
What a difference when your vision is clear  
And you see things as they really are  
  
I used to be color-blind  
But I met you and now I find  
There's green in the grass  
There's gold in the moon  
There's blue in the skies  
  
That semi-circle that was always hanging about  
Is not a storm cloud, it's a rainbow  
And you brought the colors out  
  
Believe me it's really true  
Till I met you I never knew  
A setting sun could paint such beautiful skies  
  
I never knew there were such lovely colors  
And the big surprise  
Is the red in your cheeks  
The gold in your hair  
The blue in your eyes

Don't tell me about a night in June  
Or a shady lane beneath the velvet moon  
Don't tell me, 'cause I want to talk about you.  
  
Don't mention that waterfall  
Or that shady nook where crickets softly call  
Don't tell me, 'cause I want to talk about you.  
  
The moon and the stars, the objects on Mars  
Are things that we've talked of before  
But your love for me was the question  
Your answer throws back heaven's door, so  
  
Tell me, your love will be sincere,  
Then my darling, you needn't ever fear  
I love you and I want to talk about you.  
  
The moon and the stars, the objects on Mars  
Are things that we've talked of before  
But your love for me was the question  
Your answer throws back heaven's door, so  
  
Tell me, your love will be sincere,  
Then my darling, you needn't ever fear  
I love you and I want to talk about you.

The sleepless nights, the daily fights  
The quick toboggan, when you reach the heights  
I miss the kisses, and I miss the bites  
I wish I were in love again  
  
The broken dates, the endless waits  
The lovely loving, and the hateful hates  
The conversation, with the flying plates  
I wish I were in love again  
  
No more pain, no more strain  
Now I'm sane, but I would rather be punched, drunk  
  
The pulled out fur, of cat and cur  
The fine mismating, of a him and her  
I've learned my lesson, but I wish I were  
In love again  
  
The furtive sigh, the blackened eye  
The words: "I love you, 'til the day I day"  
The self deception, that believes the lie  
I wish I were in love again  
  
When love congeals, it soon reveals  
The faint aroma, of performing seals  
The double-crossing, of a pair of heals  
I wish I were in love again  
  
No, no more care, no, no despair  
Now I'm all there (now), but I'd rather be punk drunk  
  
Believe me sir, I much prefer  
The classic battle, of a him and her  
I don't like quiet, and I wish I were  
In love again, in love again, in love again

I won't dance, don't ask me  
I won't dance, don't ask me  
I won't dance madame with you  
My heart won't  
Let me feet do things that they should do  
  
You know what, you're lovely you know what, you're so lovely  
And you know what you do to me  
I'm like an ocean wave that's bumped on the shore  
I feel so absolutely  
Stumped on the floor  
  
When you dance, you're charming and you're gentle  
Especially when you do the Continental  
But this feeling isn't purely mental  
For heaven rest us, I'm not asbestos  
And that's why I  
Won't dance, why should I?  
  
I won't dance, how could I?  
I won't dance, Merci beau coup  
  
I know  
That music lead the way to romance  
So if I hold you in arms I won't dance  
  
I won't dance, don't ask me  
I won't dance, don't ask me  
I won't dance madame with you  
My heart won't let me feet do things that  
They want to do  
  
You know what, you're so lovely, ring a ding-ding, you're lovely  
And you know what  
You do to me  
I'm like an ocean wave that's bumped on the shore  
I feel so absolutely stumped on the  
Floor  
  
When you dance, you're charming and you're gentle  
Especially when you do the Continental  
But this feeling isn't purely mental  
For heaven rest us, I'm not asbestos  
And that's why I won't dance,  
I won't dance  
  
I won't dance, Merci beau coup  
I know that music leads the way to romance  
  
So if I hold  
You in arms I won't dance

I'd love to get you on a slow boat to China  
All by myself, alone  
Get you and keep you in my arms evermore  
Leave all your lovelies weeping on the far away shore  
  
Out on the briny with a moon big and shiny  
Melting your heart of stone  
I'd like to get you on a slow boat to China  
All to myself, alone  
  
All to myself alone  
Leave all your lovelies  
Weeping on the far away shore  
  
Out on the briny with a moon big and shiny  
Melting your heart of stone  
I'd like to get you on a slow boat to China  
All to myself, all to myself  
All to myself alone

Ask me how do I feel  
Ask me now that we're cosy and clingin'  
Well, sir, all I can say  
Is if I were a bell, I'd be ringin'  
From the moment we kissed tonight  
That's the way I've just gotta behave  
Boy, if I were a lamp, I'd light  
Or if I were a banner, I'd wave  
  
Ask me how do I feel  
Little me with my quiet upbringing  
Well, sir, all I can say  
Is if I were a gate, I'd be swinging  
And if I were a watch  
I'd start popping my springs  
Or if I were a bell  
I'd go ding dong, ding dong ding  
  
Yes, I knew my morale would crack  
From the wonderful way that you looked  
Boy, if I were a duck, I'd quack  
Or if I were a goose, I'd be cooked  
  
Ask me how do I feel  
Ask me now that we're fondly caressing  
Well, if I were a salad  
I know I'd be splashing my dressing  
Or if I were a season, I'd surely be spring  
Or if I were a gate, I would swing  
Have a fling almost any old thing  
Or if I were a bell  
I'd go ding dong, ding dong  
Ding dong, ding dong, ding dong, ding, ding dong

If you ever should leave  
Why would I want to live?  
Darling, you must believe  
Won't you try to forgive  
What a fool I would be  
If I fooled with your love for me?  
I'd be wrong from the start  
I'd be unfair to my heart  
So whatever you do  
Don't you say that we're through  
I'd do nothing but grieve  
If you ever should leave  
  
Oh, what a fool I would be  
If I fooled with your love for me  
I'd be wrong from the start  
I'd be unfair to my heart  
So whatever you do  
Don't you say that were through  
I'd do nothing but grieve  
If you ever should leave  
I'd do nothing but grieve  
If you ever should leave

Now we'll say till something do us part  
That old dad of mine ain't got a heart  
Any girl who's out for pleasure  
Thinks of marriage only at her leisure  
As it is, they've got the horse behind the cart  
  
When my pop said we must wed,  
He kind of wowed me, still I'm read-y  
But one thing must be clear  
At this time  
  
I'll be hard to handle  
I promise you that  
And if you complain  
Here's one little Jane  
Who'll leave you flat  
  
I'll be hard to handle  
What else can I be  
I say with a shrug  
I think you're a mug  
To marry me  
  
When you first threw me a gander  
I was willing to philander  
But I never thought I'd have to be a bride  
Now you're gonna find tough sledding  
I don't want no shotgun wedding  
I was only along for the ride  
  
I'll be hard to handle  
I'm telling you plain  
Just be a dear  
And scram out of here  
I'm gonna raise cain  
  
I'll be hard to handle  
My bridges are burned  
This wedding's a gag  
And you're in the bag  
Where I'm concerned  
  
I'll be hard to handle  
When we've said, "I do"  
See there's no hope  
I just got a dope  
When I took you  
  
I'll be living my life in bed  
But they always will be twin beds  
And I warn you, you'll be living like a monk  
Our affair is now a past one  
So don't think you've pulled a fast one  
Just remember, I think you're a punk!  
  
I'll be hard to handle  
I'm no ball and chain  
I'll find some means  
To call the Marines  
I'm gonna raise cain  
  
Gonna raise cain  
I'm telling you plain  
I'm gonna raise cain

Each time I hold somebody new  
My arms go cold thinking of you  
No one can take your place, darling, in my embrace  
I'll never be free  
  
And when my lips burn with desire  
No other kiss can put out the fire  
Though I may try and try, no one can satisfy  
This longing in me  
  
[Chorus]  
I'll never be free from your smile so tender  
The sweet surrender in your eyes  
How can I be free when I still remember?  
How you could thrill me with a sigh  
Just like a chain bound to my heart  
Your love remains while we're apart  
  
Each kiss I gave to you  
Made me a slave to you  
I'll never be free  
  
[Chorus]  
  
That kiss I gave to you  
Made me a slave to you  
I'll never be free

I'll never be the same  
Stars have lost their meaning for me  
I'll never be the same  
Nothing's what it once used to be  
  
And when the song birds that sing  
Tell me it's spring  
I can't believe their song  
Once love was king but kings can be wrong  
  
I'll never be the same  
There is such an ache in my heart  
Never be the same  
Since we're apart  
  
Though there's a lot that a smile may hide  
I know down deep inside  
I'll never be the same  
Never be the same again  
  
And when the song birds that sing  
Tell me it's spring  
I can't believe their song  
Once love was king but kings can be wrong  
  
I'll never be the same  
There is such an ache in my heart  
Never be the same  
Since we're apart  
  
Though there's a lot that a smile may hide  
I know down deep inside  
I'll never be the same  
Never be the same again, again  
My heart will never be the same again, again

What do you get when you fall in love?  
A guy with a pin to burst your bubble  
That's what you get for all your trouble  
I'll never fall in love again  
  
What do you get when you kiss a guy?  
You get enough germs to catch pneumonia  
After you do, he'll never phone you  
I'll never fall in love again  
  
Don't tell me what it's all about  
'Cause I've been there and I'm glad I'm out  
Out of those chains, those chains that bind you  
That is why I'm here to remind you  
  
What do you get when you need a guy?  
You get enough tears to feel an ocean  
That's what you get for your devotion  
I'll never fall in love again  
  
Don't tell me what it's all about  
'Cause I've been there and I'm glad I'm out  
Out of those chains, those chains that bind you  
That is why I'm here to remind you  
  
What do you get when you fall in love?  
Nothing but pain, lies, and sorrow  
So for at least until tomorrow  
I'll never fall in love again

Blow ill wind, blow away, find my love today  
You're blowin' me no good, no good  
Go ill wind, go away, skies are oh, so gray  
Around my neighborhood and that's no good  
  
You're only misleadin' the sunshine I'm needin'  
Ain't that a shame  
It's so hard to keep up with troubles that creep up  
From out of nowhere, when loves to blame  
  
So ill wind, blow away, find my love today  
You're blowin' me no good, no good, no good

I never cared much for moonlit skies  
I never wink back at fireflies  
But now that the stars are in your eyes  
I'm beginning to see the light  
  
I never went in for afterglow  
Or candlelight on the mistletoe  
But now when you turn the lamp down low  
I'm beginning to see the light  
  
Used to ramble through the park  
Shadow boxing in the dark  
Then you came and caused a spark  
That's a four-alarm fire, now  
  
I never made love by lantern shine  
I never saw rainbows in my wine  
But now that your lips are burning mine  
I'm beginning to see the light  
  
I never cared much for moonlit skies  
I never wink back at fireflies  
But now that the stars are in your eyes  
I'm beginning to see the light  
  
I never went in for afterglow  
Or candlelight on the mistletoe  
But now when you turn the lamp down low  
I'm beginning to see the light  
  
Used to ramble through the park  
Shadow boxing in the dark  
Then you came and caused a spark  
That's a four-alarm fire, now  
  
I never made love by lantern shine  
I never saw rainbows in my wine  
But now that your lips are burning mine  
I'm beginning to see the light  
  
Now that the stars are in your eyes  
I'm beginning to see the light  
Now when you turn the lamp down low  
I'm beginning to see the light  
  
Used to ramble through the park  
Shadow boxing in the dark  
Then you came and caused a spark  
That's a four-alarm fire, now  
  
Now that your lips are burning mine  
I'm beginning to see the light  
I'm beginning to see the light  
I'm beginning to see the light  
  
Now that your lips are burning mine  
I'm beginning to see the light

I'm confessin' that I love you  
Tell me, do you love me too?  
I'm confessin' that I need you  
Honest, honest, I do, I do, oh yeah  
  
In your eyes, your eyes, your eyes, your eyes, your eyes, your eyes, your eyes  
I read such strange things  
But your lips deny that they are true  
Baby, will your answer really change things?  
Making me blue  
  
I'm afraid some day you're gonna leave me  
Saying, why can't we still be friends?  
If you go, you know you're gonna grieve me  
'Cause all my life on you depends  
  
I'm guessing, guessing that you love me  
Dreaming dreams, dreaming dreams, dreaming, dreaming, dreaming dreams of you
in vain  
Whoa, I'm confessin' that I love you  
Over, over, over, over, and over again  
  
Whoa, I'm afraid some day, some day you're going to leave me  
Saying, baby, can we still be friends, old friends now?  
If you go, if you go, you know you're gonna grieve me  
'Cause all my life on you depends  
  
I'm guessing that you love me, yeah  
Dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, dreaming dreams of you in
vain  
Oh, I'm confessin' that I love you  
Over and over and over and over and over and over again  
I'm confessin' that I love you over and over and over  
All over again, oh yeah

Woke up this morning wanting to cry  
Then I remember, yes, I know why  
She's a real good one for having her cake  
I'm gonna go fishing or jump in the lake  
  
Yeah, I'm gonna go fishing, that's what I'll do  
Think about nothing, not even you  
Catch a real big one, a big speckled trout  
Snapping in the water, I'll pull him on out  
  
Sweet talking liar, spin me a yarn  
Tell me a story, big as a barn  
Don't stop listening, I won't hear you out  
I'm gonna go fishing and catch me a trout  
  
If a gal is a liar, a gal is a fool  
Playing for keepers and breaking the rules  
She'll be the loser, yet to find out  
I'm gonna go fishing and catch me a trout  
  
Here in the water, look at him shine  
There goes a big one, that one is mine  
Catch up the reel now, I've got the feel now  
Hooked onto my fly rod, I've got me a trout  
  
Sweet talking liar, you're in for a fall  
You tell me a story, you cut to the wall  
Don't go my way, I'm down the highway  
I'm gonna go fishing  
  
Yes, I'm gonna go fishing  
Yes, I'm gonna go fishing and get me some trout

As I walk down the street  
Seems everyone I meet  
Gives me a friendly hello.  
I guess I'm just a lucky so and so  
  
The birds in every tree  
Are all so neighborly.  
They sing wherever I go.  
I guess I'm just a lucky so and so  
  
If you should ask me the amount  
In my bank account  
I'd have to confess that I'm slippin'  
But that don't worry me, confidentially  
  
I've got a dream that's a pippin'  
And when the day is through  
Each night I hurry to  
A home where love waits, I know.  
  
I guess I'm just a lucky so and so  
  
And when the day is through  
Each night I hurry to  
A home where love waits, I know.  
I guess I'm just a lucky so and so  
  
I'm just a lucky, lucky so and so

I'm making believe that you're in my arms though I know you're so far away  
Making believe I'm talking to you, wish you could hear what I say  
And here in the gloom of my lonely room we're dancing like we used to do  
Making believe is just another way of dreaming, so till my dreams come true  
  
I'll whisper "Good night", turn out the light, and kiss my pillow  
Making believe it's you  
I'm making believe that you're in my arms though I know you're so far away  
Making believe I'm talkin' to you, wish you could hear what I say  
  
And here in the gloom of my lonely room we're dancing like we used to do  
Making believe is just another way of dreamin', so till my dreams come true  
I'll whisper "Good night", turn out the light, and kiss my pillow  
Making believe it's you  
  
And here in the gloom of my lonely room we're dancing like we used to do  
Making believe is just another way of dreamin', so till my dreams come true  
I'll whisper "Good night", turn out the light, and kiss my pillow  
Making believe it's you
