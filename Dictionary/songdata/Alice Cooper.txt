All aboard, watch your step, people  
Last call for the Nightmare Express  
  
I found myself slippin' away  
Just this side of dead  
I woke up in a boxcar  
I wasn't in my bed  
  
I found my leg chained to a spike  
That ran down through the floor  
Attached to thirteen angry men  
All rotten to the core  
  
"But I'm innocent," I cried right out  
"I'm in someone else's dream"  
They looked around and laughed out loud,  
Said, "Brother, so are we  
Yeah, brother, so are we"  
"But I'm a big celebrity  
Known all 'round the land"  
"Well buddy, you ain't no one here  
Man, you ain't in demand"  
  
Speedin' towards a flamin' wall  
Like a screamin' sonic boom  
I really gotta wake up now  
Or I may meet my doom, oh Lord  
I may meet my doom  
  
So all that I remember  
Is how much my body hurt  
Now I'm sleepin' in the graveyard  
On the wrong side of the dirt  
Now, on the wrong side of the dirt  
Wrong side of the dirt, don't you know,  
I'm on the wrong side of the dirt

If you were Lucy  
I'd be your Ricky  
When you were juicy  
I'd get real sticky  
And when you're magic  
It makes me tricky, too  
  
Yeah, I'm a Sony  
You're Panasonic  
I'm heavy metal  
You're philharmonic  
If you get earaches  
I'd turn my volume down  
A notch or two for you  
  
'Cause I will do anything for you  
Anything you want me to  
I'm so adaptable to you  
Was untrappable 'til you  
  
I will do for you  
Anything for you  
Adaptable to you  
Adaptable to you  
  
If you do that fold out  
I'll scream and holler  
But when you hold out  
I'll spend three dollars  
One way or other, babe  
I'll spend the night with you  
That's true  
  
Now, you ain't no Hepburn  
And I ain't no Fonda  
But if you were drownin'  
In Golden Ponda  
Mouth to mouth  
I'd resuscitate with you  
  
Because I'm so adaptable to you  
Anything you want me to  
I'm so adaptable to you  
Was untrappable 'til you  
  
I will do for you  
Anything for you  
Adaptable to you  
Adaptable to you  
Adaptable to you  
So plug me into you  
  
Say you're Vampira  
And needed plasma  
And I was dying  
From chronic asthma  
I'd leave my death bed  
To draw some blood for you  
Just for you  
  
Because I will do anything for you  
Anything you want me to  
And I will do anything for you  
Anything you want me to  
Yes, I'm so adaptable to you  
Leave a craps table for you  
On a winning streak  
  
I will do for you  
Anything for you  
Adaptable to you  
Adaptable to you

Adam was as happy as a man can be  
Till he started messin with an old apple tree  
Ain't that just like a woman  
Ain't that just like a woman  
Ain't that just like a woman, she'll do it every time  
  
You can buy a woman clothes give her money on the side  
No matter what you do, she ain't never satisfied  
Ain't that just like a woman  
Ain't that just like a woman  
Ain't that just like a woman, she'll do it every time

Rain is falling down my cheek  
Searching for the sea  
Tomorrow, like the rain  
I'll be back home again  
  
I watch, the bus  
As it pulls out of view  
Someday like that bus  
I will be leaving too  
  
But you know  
It breaks my heart  
To leave you  
Camelback  
My high school  
  
And now, alone  
Crying in my beer  
Cause old friends said goodbye  
I guess I'll be leaving too  
  
But you know  
It breaks my heart  
To leave you  
Cortez  
I'll miss you  
  
Yes I will  
Yes I will  
You know I will  
Yes I will  
Yes I will  
You know I will  
  
Well so long, so long  
Everybody, everybody  
I hope that I would see you again, again  
Goodbye, goodbye  
Everybody, everybody  
I finally grew up  
They finally let me out of school  
  
Hey, remember the time, 'member the time  
We took that snake  
And put down little Betsy's dress?  
Now I don't think Miss Axelrod  
Was much impressed  
No I don't think Miss Axelrod  
Was much impressed  
Well I don't think Miss Axelrod  
Was much impressed  
  
Oh, goodbye  
Everybody  
I hope that I would see you again  
So long  
Everybody  
How do you like that  
They finally let me out of school  
Goodbye  
Ah, I want to get out of here  
They let me out of school  
How 'bout that, uh?  
Goodbye  
Hey, goodbye, guys  
Maybe I'll see  
Maybe I'll see you around some time, uh?  
Hey, don't make a stranger of yourself, uh?  
Remember the Coop, uh?  
May, I ho  
I hope you don't forget me or nothing  
Goodbye

I get these killer headaches  
I get one everyday  
I wake up with a migraine  
Since you ran away  
  
Got a load of tension  
Burnin up my neck  
Something is wrong with my suspension  
So pass those tablets to this wreck  
  
Aspirin damage - Aspirin damage  
Kills the pain - destroys the brain  
No one told me bout Aspirin damage  
Sometimes I find myself shakin  
Rom the medication taken  
Oh yeah  
  
I balance my Excedrin  
And Anacins in stacks  
I'm a pain reliever junkie  
I got a Bayer on my back  
  
I went to see the doctor  
He walked me down the hall  
Said "Strip down 'til you're naked  
Your suit, your tie and all."  
  
Aspirin damage - Aspirin damage  
Kills the pain - destroys the brain  
Aspirin damage, my disadvantage  
Sometimes I find myself shakin  
From the medication taken  
Oh yeah  
  
Aspirin damage - Aspirin damage  
Kills the pain - destroys the brain  
Aspirin damage, my disadvantage  
Sometimes I find myself shakin  
From the medication taken  
Oh yeah

Got a cut on my thigh, got a nail in my eye  
And I'm bleedin' all over the wall  
Got a barbed wire bat and a dude on the mat  
Ain't getting up soon at all  
  
Got a head full of rage and a belly full of hate  
I'm the neighbourhood legend that just can't wait  
  
For the backyard brawl  
Backyard brawl  
Another backyard brawl  
Backyard brawl  
Another backyard brawl  
Backyard brawl  
Another backyard brawl  
  
Don't matter who you are, don't matter what colour  
Brown or white'll do  
But if you're yellow you'll be covered in red  
A whole lotta black and blue  
  
Jump off the trailer in a pile full o' guys  
Scratching and kicking and pulverised  
  
For the backyard brawl  
Backyard brawl  
Another backyard brawl  
Backyard brawl  
Another backyard brawl  
Backyard brawl  
Another backyard brawl  
  
Only got six teeth but three of those  
Are sharp enough to bite off your nose  
  
At the backyard brawl  
Backyard brawl  
Another backyard brawl  
Backyard brawl  
Another backyard brawl  
Backyard brawl  
Another backyard brawl  
Backyard brawl  
Another backyard brawl  
Backyard brawl  
Another backyard brawl  
Backyard brawl  
Another backyard brawl  
Backyard Brawl  
Another backyard brawl  
Backyard Brawl  
  
[Dialogue]  
You think you're so [beep] tough  
You talkin' to me?  
You're mine  
Come on, lets go  
Come on stitches..  

I'm a creature of the street  
And I rip off all the money  
I was kicked in the teeth  
Shoved face first through a window  
I got a gangland name  
And a teardrop tattooed eye  
They call me Little Caesar in the  
Brotherhood of crime  
I know about the pain  
Dying in an alley with an  
Air-conditioned brain  
I know, it's for real  
Flat lined in an ambulance  
Without a pulse to feel  
  
[Chorus]  
Hey blood brother, you're one of our own  
You're as sharp as a razor  
And as hard as a stone  
Hey blood brother, you're bad to the bone  
You're a natural killer  
In a bad place alone  
  
They call me Smoky Joe  
And I'm as thin as a coroner's needle  
I got a pocket full of rocks  
Man, I shake like a cold chihuahua  
I got a runny nose  
And a road map on my arm  
I blew my gig poking around the gallery  
With someone else's rig  
I know, I understand  
I watch my body hauled off  
By the local garbage man  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We're cool, we're cold  
We're stiff, we're tagged  
We're slabbed, we're croaked  
We're whacked, we're cracked  
We're smoked and cured and  
Slammed and slurred and  
Sliced and diced and put on ice  
Cooked and stewed and badly brewed  
And splattered once or twice  
  
Hey blood brother

Beautiful flyaway  
Somewhere like Holy Days  
Wonder what brought me down to earth  
Haven't I always been here  
Let's have another nibble  
Later I think I'll disappear into the bishop's mall  
And take a look at what we offer  
DDT poisoning me changing my relativity  
What's it going to be  
  
Da da da da d-da  
Later I think I'll disappear into another room  
And take a look inside the till  
Lovely days, human ways, journeys that take us to the end  
Ah  
  
Haven't we always been here  
Sharing one love and one fear  
Some day you'll know that life is really, really all about you  
So come and look inside  
You'll be surprised to find  
Later I think I'll disappear into another womb  
And take a look inside the mens' room  
Haven't I given you everything that I could give  
Where do you live  
Ah  
  
You are the only censor.  
If you don't like what I say, you have a choice.  
You can turn me off  
  
You are the only censor  
If you don't like what I say, you have a choice.  
You can turn me off

Yeah!!!  
  
Yeah we're gonna fight  
We do it every night  
Baby when you scratch  
You know I'm gonna bite  
  
You can make me die  
I can make you cry  
Opposites attract  
That's the reason why  
  
[Chorus]  
No one else could make you feel like I do, I do, I do  
No one ever gets as deep inside you, as I do baby  
Our love is a bed of nails  
Love hurts good on a bed of nails  
I'll lay you down and when all else fails  
I'll drive you like a hammer on a bed of nails.  
  
First we're gonna kiss  
Then we're gonna say  
Dirty little words  
Only lovers say  
  
Rocking through the night  
Rolling on the floor  
When they hear you screaming  
They'll be breaking down the door  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Bed of nails  
Bed of nails  
I'll drive you like a hammer on a bed of nail  
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow  
Gonna drive you like a hammer  
Gonna put in my slammer  
Oh yeah!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Our love is a bed of nails  
Love hurts good on a bed of nails  
I'll lay you down and when all else fails  
I'll drive you like a hammer on a bed of nails  
  
Our love is a bed of nails  
Love hurts good on a bed of nails  
I'll lay you down and when all else fails  
I'll drive you like a hammer on a bed of nails

We're so young and pretty, we're so young and clean  
So many things that we have never seen  
Let's move from Ohio, sell this dam' old store  
Big Apple dreamin' on a wooden floor  
  
Skyscrapers and subways and stations  
Staring up at the United Nations  
  
New York is waiting for you and me, baby  
Waiting to swallow us down  
New York, we're coming to see what you're made of  
Are you as great as you sound  
  
Heard about them massages, and all those dirty shows  
I read somewhere some places never close  
While we waste time on yokels, comin' through the door  
Big Apple dreamin' on a wooden floor  
  
Skyscrapers and subways and stations  
Staring up at the United Nations  
  
New York is waiting for you and me, baby  
Waiting to swallow us down  
New York, we're coming to see what you're made of  
Are you as great as you sound  
  
New York is waiting for you and me, baby  
Waiting to swallow us down  
New York, we're coming to see what you're made of  
Are you as tough as you sound  
  
Oh, New York is waiting for you and me, baby  
Waiting to swallow us down, whoo-oo  
New York, we're coming, to see what you're made of  
Are you as tough as you sound  
  
Yeah, New York is waiting, baby  
Waiting to swallow us down,  
New York, we're coming, see what you're made of  
You can't be as tough as you sound  
  
Oh, New York, you and me, baby  
Waiting to swallow us down,  
New York, we're coming see what you're made of  
Are you as great as you sound  
  
Oh, New York, Oh, New York we're coming  
Oh, we're coming to see what you're made of  
Oh, you can't be as tough as you sound  
Me and my baby, we're coming  
Oh, we're coming  
  
They're waiting for you and me, baby  
Oh... (Fading out dialog?)

Billion dollar baby  
Rubber little lady, slicker than a weasel  
Grimy as an alley  
Loves me like no other lover  
Billion dollar baby  
Rubber little monster, baby, I adore you  
Man or woman living couldn't love me like you, baby  
  
We go dancing nightly in the attic  
While the moon is rising in the sky  
If I'm too rough, tell me  
I'm so scared your little head will come off in my hands  
  
Billion dollar baby  
I got you in the dime store  
No other little girl could ever hold you  
Any tighter, any tighter than me, bay  
Billion dollar baby  
Reckless like a gambler, million dollar maybe  
Foaming like a dog that's been infected by the rabies  
  
We go dancing nightly in the attic  
While the moon is rising the sky  
If I'm too rough, tell me  
I'm so scared your little head will come off in my hands  
Million dollar baby  
Billion dollar bay  
Trillion dollar baby  
Zillion dollar baby

Body  
Body  
  
Touched by the toil and plunged into his arm  
Cursed through the night through eyes of alarm  
A melody black flowed out of my breath  
Searching for death, but bodies need rest  
  
Body  
  
Under the soil now waiting for worms  
All that I feared is all that I've learned  
All that I know is all that I think  
Dead feelings are cool, down lower I sink, ah-hah  
  
Bodies need rest  
We all need our rest  
Sleep an easy sleep  
Rest  
Rest  
Bodies need their rest  
We all need our rest  
Sleep an easy sleep  
Rest  
Rest  
Rest  
Rest  
But come back in the morning  
  
Come back hard  
  
Wake up  
Wake up  
Wake up  
Wake up  
  
Bodies  
Clutching and biting my soul has caught on fire  
My evil is now and I'm caught up in desire  
Everything I'm living for is all that I am  
Liking it and loving it that's all in the plan  
  
Black Juju

Take one in the leg [Think about your baby]  
Take one in the side [Think about your girl]  
Take one in the head [Think about your mother]  
Take one in the heart [It's the end of the world]  
  
So blow me a kiss 'cause I'm black  
Blow me a kiss 'cause I'm gay  
Blow me a kiss 'cause I'm shakin'  
Say goodnight then blow me away  
Blow me away  
Blow me away  
Tell me what you're thinkin' tell me why  
Blow me a kiss then blow me away  
  
Take one in the face [Think about your life]  
Take one in the eye [Think about your soul]  
Take one in the mouth [Think about your savior]  
Take one in the thigh [Are you ready to go]  
  
So blow me a kiss 'cause I'm lonely  
Blow me a kiss 'cause I'm afraid  
Blow me a kiss 'cause you don't know me  
Say goodnight then blow me away  
Blow me away  
Blow me away  
Tell me what you're thinkin' tell me why  
Blow me away  
  
I'm in my room I'm Dr. Doom  
'Cause I'm not me I'm someone else  
Why should you die don't ask me why  
You know it, you know it, you know it  
Blow me away  
  
I turn the page I am the rage  
I'm coming from a darker place  
A much darker place  
So blow me away  
Blow me away  
Yeah blow me away  
Tell me what you're thinkin' tell me why  
Blow me a kiss then blow me away  
Yeah blow me away  
C'mon and blow me away  
Tell me what you're thinkin' tell me why  
Blow me a kiss then blow me away

We're spinning round on this ball of hate  
There's no parole, there's no great escape  
We're sentenced here until the end of days  
And then my brother there's a price to pay  
  
We're only human, we were born to die  
Without the benefit of reason why  
We live for pleasure to be satisfied  
And now it's over there's no place to hide  
  
Why don't you, come down to  
It's such a brutal planet  
It's such an ugly world  
Why won't you, come down to  
  
"This world is such perfection" (What a sight)  
"It's just like paradise" (For your eyes)  
"A truly grand creation" (What a sight)  
"From up here it looks so nice" (For my eyes)  
  
It's such a brutal planet  
It's such a living hell  
It was a holy garden  
That's right where Adam fell  
It's where the bite was taken  
It's where we chose to sin  
It's where we first were naked  
This is where our death begins  
  
We took advice from that deceiving snake  
He said "don't worry it's a piece of cake"  
And sent us swimming in a burning lake  
Now we're abandoned here for heaven's sake  
  
Why don't you, come down to  
It's such a brutal planet  
It's such an ugly world  
Why won't you, come down to  
  
"This world is such perfection" (What a sight)  
"It's just like paradise" (For my eyes)  
"A truly grand creation" (What a sight)  
"From up here it looks so nice" (For my eyes)  
  
Here's where we keep the armies  
Here's where we write their names  
Here's where the money god is  
Here's our famous hall of shame  
Here's where we starve the hungry  
Here's where we cheat the poor  
Here's where we beat the children  
Here is where we pay the whores  
  
Why don't you, come down to  
It's such a brutal planet  
It's such an ugly world  
Why won't you, come down to  
  
"This world is such perfection" (What a sight)  
"It's just like paradise" (For my eyes)  
"A truly grand creation" (What a sight)  
"From up here it looks so nice" (For my eyes)  
  
Right here we stoned the prophets  
Built idols out of mud  
Right here we fed the lions  
Christian flesh and Christian blood  
Down here is where we hung him  
Upon an ugly cross  
Over there we filled the ovens  
Right here the holocaust

Baby, don't you she'd a tear for me  
I wouldn't want to waste your time  
You talked a lot of trash and ya lied to me  
But babe, you never even tried  
  
Oh, oh, oh  
You can hold my heart for ransom  
But you'll never own my soul  
  
CHORUS  
Baby, I might lose my mind  
Maybe I might lose my head  
But one thing I'll never do  
Is swallow my pride crawlin' back to you  
Baby, I'm burning our bed  
  
There used to be a time when you were everything  
My flame through the night  
You got me hot  
Then you blew me out  
Like this match I'm about to light  
  
Oh, oh, oh  
You can tear my heart to pieces  
Left me standing in the cold  
  
Baby, I might lose my mind  
Maybe I might lose my head  
One thing I gotta do  
Is torch those sheets and pillows too  
Baby, I'm burning out bed  
  
Well, I used to think your were so kind  
How could I be so blind  
  
Oh, oh, oh  
I'm free  
But I'm alone  
  
Baby, I might lose my mind  
Maybe I might lose my head  
But one thing I swear to you  
Is you're gonna feel the heat before the night is through  
  
Baby you're burning me,  
Sometimes a man can bleed  
Baby, I'm burning our bed  
  
Baby, I might lose my mind  
Maybe I might lose my head  
But one thing I'll never do  
Is swallow my pride crawlin' back to you  
Baby, I'm burning our bed  

What's wrong with you today  
I could never tell?  
Got something drastic on your mind  
I can smell the smell  
  
Honey, what's your trip today?  
Can't look me in the eye  
A couple thousand miles away  
You took me by surprise  
  
You left a message on the telephone  
From New York City, your new home  
You didn't like the neighborhood  
You really hated Hollywood  
  
[Chorus]  
You said  
Bye bye, baby  
Bye bye, girl  
Bye bye, baby  
You're in another world  
  
You said my friends are boring  
You said my house is small  
You like it fifty stories high  
You like livin' tall  
  
You hate the L.A. freeways  
You hate the L.A. smog  
You hate the west coast phonies  
You like the city dogs  
  
I'm confused but I'm not mad  
Said I'm the worst you've ever had  
I ain't delusional or institutional  
But I'm pretty sure I ain't that bad  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I tried to reach you on your private line  
You sure ain't calling mine  
Now I'm sittin' here all alone  
With a broken heart in three time zones  
  
Bye bye, baby  
(Bye bye, baby)  
Bye bye, girl  
(Paging your phone)  
  
Bye bye, baby  
(Please check your email)  
Bye bye, girl  
(Why not your beeper?)  
  
Bye bye, baby  
(Stick your head out the window)  
Bye bye, girl  
(Oh, I'm mad as hell)  
Bye bye, baby  
  
Anyone at home?  
Hello? Hello?  
Anybody there?  
Hello? Pick up?

Welcome to my nightmare  
I think you're gonna like it  
I think you're gonna feel you belong.  
A nocturnal vacation, unnecessary sedation,  
You want to feel at home 'cause you belong  
Welcome to my nightmare whoa, ho, ho, ho  
  
Welcome to my breakdown  
I hope I didn't scare you  
That's just the way we are when we come down  
We sweat and laugh and scream here  
'Cause life is just a dream here  
You know inside you feel right at home, here  
Yeah, welcome to my nightmare yeah, hey, hey, hey  
  
Welcome to my nightmare  
I think you're gonna like it  
I think you're gonna feel you belong  
We sweat and laugh and scream here  
'Cause life is just a dream here  
You know inside you feel right at home, here  
  
Welcome to my nightmare  
Hoo, hoo, woo, hoo  
Welcome to my breakdown  
Yeah

I've been around watching little late shows  
Drink a lot of beer  
Like playing cards with my friends  
  
Call it evil  
Call it pain  
It goes knock, knock, knock-knock-knock-knock, on my door  
It goes knock, knock, knock-knock-knock-knock, on my door

Going to get as my babe.

Playing sopwith in the back of my head  
What you trying to be crazy?  
People look at me, they look at me, but you're dead  
  
Call it evil

It goes knock, knock, knock-knock-knock-knock, on my door

Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, on my door  
Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, on my door  
Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, on my door  
Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, on my door

Don't sing me lullabies  
I won't close my eyes,  
I can't close my eyes  
It's true,  
I'm doomed  
'til dawn  
Shines through  
Got too many things to do  
Got friends to see,  
I can't miss a thing  
It's true,  
I'm through  
I'm screwed,  
Unglued  
  
I won't close my eyes, I can't close my eyes,  
I never close my eyes  
You see, they're always there with funny hair,  
Oh, I'm so scared  
  
It happens to me every night  
Can't sleep, the clowns will eat me  
They always want to take a bite  
Can't sleep, the clowns will eat me  
And if you think this isn't real  
I'll show you wounds that never heal  
To them I'm just a happy meal  
Can't sleep, the clowns will eat me  
  
Make the coffee black as night  
Help me through the night  
I know their appetite for me  
I'm meat  
But I'm sweet  
As can be  
And if I do too much booze  
I begin to snooze  
I hear the big old floppy shoes  
It's true,  
I'm stew,  
Unchewed  
  
I won't close my eyes, I can't close my eyes,  
I never close my eyes  
See, they're always there with that funny hair,  
Oh, I'm so scared  
  
It happens to me every night  
Can't sleep, the clowns will eat me  
They always want to take a bite  
Can't sleep, the clowns will eat me  
And if you think this isn't real  
I'll show you wounds that never heal  
To them I'm just a happy meal  
Can't sleep, the clowns will eat me

She was not the first  
And he won't be my last  
My hunger and my thirst  
My brilliant future  
And my ugly past  
  
They'll all be here with me  
'Til my web is spun  
My blessing and my curse  
There'll be no rest  
Until my work is done  
  
Catch me, catch me if you can  
Catch me, catch me when you can  
I can't control myself  
  
You won't have a clue  
Of what is coming next  
What I'm gonna do  
Surely classical in its effect  
  
Which limb will I choose?  
Which one gets sawn in half?  
Which leg would you lose?  
To an arachnophobic psychopath  
  
Catch me, catch me if you can  
I wrestled with the devil and I'll do it again  
Catch me, catch me when you can  
I can't control myself  
  
Catch me, catch me if you can  
I'm scheming with the demons and I'll do it again  
Catch me, catch me when you can  
I can't control myself, I can't control myself  
  
Catch me, catch me if you can  
Catch me, catch me when you can  
Catch me, catch me if you can  
I'm scheming with the demons and I'll do it again  
  
Catch me, catch me when you can  
I can't control myself, I just can't control myself  
I'm scheming with the demons and I'll do it again  
  
I wrestled with the devil and I'll do it again  
I'm scheming with the demons and I'll do it again

Well I'm runnin through the world  
With a gun in my back  
Tryin' to catch a ride in a Cadillac  
Thought that I was livin'  
But you can't really tell  
Been tryin' to get away  
From that success smell  
  
You know I need a houseboat and I need a plane  
I need a butler and a trip to Spain  
I need everything  
The world owes me  
I tell that to myself  
And I agree  
  
I'm caught in a dream  
So What!  
You don't know what I'm goin' through  
I'm right in between  
So I'll  
I'll just play along with you  
  
Well I'm runnin' through the world  
With a gun in my back  
Tryin' to catch a ride in that Cadillac  
Thought I was livin'  
But you can't never tell  
What I thought was heaven  
Turned out to be hell  
  
Whoa-o-oh  
When you see me with a smile on my face  
Whoa-o-oh  
Then you'll know I'm a mental case  
  
I'm caught in a dream  
So what!  
I don't know what I'm going through  
I'm right in between  
So I'll  
I'll just play along with you  
  
Whoa-o-oh Oh  
Whoa-o-oh Oh  
Whoa-o-oh

Some people call me the Creeper  
'Cause they don't know my name or face  
I got 'em running in circles  
Because a homicidal genius never leaves a trace  
I'm a lonely hunter  
City full of game  
Walkin' in the neon lights  
  
[Chorus:]  
Chop, chop, chop, engine of destruction  
Chop, chop, chop, a perfect killing machine  
Chop, chop, chop, it's a symbiotic function  
Chop, chop, chop, I keep the city so clean  
Chop, chop, chop  
  
Some people call me the Ripper  
Stole my modus operandi from the movie screen  
She's just a celluloid stripper  
Just another bloody player in my splatter-filled dream  
Women on the streets  
Want money when we meet  
I take them for a little ride  
  
[Chorus]  
  
She was standing on the corner  
With her bright red lips  
Her face was so white and pale (so pale)  
She had a black leather skirt  
That was tight to her hips  
And an anklet with a name  
It spelled M-A-R-Y... Gail  
Gail, Gail, Gail, Gail  
Gail, Gail, Gail, Gail

I don't know but I've been told  
The streets of hell are paved with gold  
Crazy, crazy  
You told me that nothing's free  
Except my own insanity  
Crazy, maybe  
Wake me, shake me  
Wake me, shake me  
  
You offer me the world and all its wealth  
All for myself  
You promised me a life eternally  
And drink to my health  
I may seem only half-glued  
But I can see right through you  
  
Burn it up, burn it down  
Burn this sucker to the ground  
Oh yeah, oh yeah  
Going, going, going, gone  
There's a party going on  
And on, and on, and on  
  
Do you think I don't know who you are  
A fallen star  
When I feel my soul scream out at night  
I know you're not far  
You need a better disguise  
This one won't win any prize  
  
Burn it up, burn it down  
Burn this sucker to the ground  
Oh yeah, oh yeah  
Going, going, going, gone  
There's a party going on  
And on, and on, and on  
  
Cleansed by fire, cleansed by fire  
I may seem only half-glued  
But I can see right through you  
  
What about dark  
What about light  
What about wrong  
What about right  
What about death  
What about sin  
What about the web you're trying to spin  
  
What about truth  
What about life  
What about glory  
What about Christ  
What about peace  
What about love  
What about faith in God above  
What about war  
What about hell  
What if I stumble  
What if I fell  
What about blood  
What about greed  
And all of these things you're offering me  
  
Yeah, what about me, little me  
You lose and I win  
You couldn't suck me in  
It's over, you have no power  
You're lost  
And I'm found  
And I'm Heaven bound  
Go back to where you belong  
To where you fell  
Go to hell

One thing I miss is Cold Ethyl and her skeleton kiss  
We met last night making love by the refrigerator light  
Ethyl Ethyl let me squeeze you in my arms  
Ethyl Ethyl come and freeze me with your charms  
  
One thing  
No lie  
Ethyl's frigid as an eskimo pie  
She's cool in bed  
Well she oughta be 'cause Ethyl's dead  
  
Ethyl Ethyl let me squeeze you in my arms  
Ethyl Ethyl come and freeze me with your charms  
Come on Cold Ethyl  
Freeze me babe  
  
One thing - it's true  
Cold Ethyl I am stuck on you  
And everything is my way  
Ethyl don't have much to say  
  
Ethyl Ethyl let me squeeze you in my arms  
Ethyl Ethyl come and freeze me with your charms  
Come here Cold Ethyl  
What makes you so cold? Ooh so cold  
  
Cold Ethyl  
Cold Cold Ethyl  
If I live 'til ninety-seven  
You'll still be waiting in refrigerator heaven  
  
'Cause you're cool  
You're ice  
Cold Ethyl  
You're my paradise

I see you working at your station  
Radiation burns my eyes  
Love's forbidden so is passion  
This whole place is sterilized  
  
I just want to see tomorrow  
Day by day to just survive  
But this place is built to kill me  
No one here gets out alive  
  
I don't want to be  
I don't want to be  
Just a memory  
I don't want to be  
I don't want to be  
Gone  
  
You don't know my name  
You don't know my number  
You don't know my face at all (at all at all at all)  
We walk right past each other, every single day  
Like cold machines, we're marching on and on and on and on and on  
  
Got your thumb print always with me  
Got your barcode memorized  
They came here to electroshock me  
But can they erase you from my mind?  
  
I don't want to be  
I don't want to be  
Just a memory  
I don't want to be  
I don't want to be  
Gone  
  
You don't know my name  
You don't know my number  
You don't know my face at all (at all at all at all)  
We walk right past each other, every single day  
Like cold machines, we're marching on and on and on and on and on  
  
I don't want to be  
I don't want to be  
Just a memory  
I don't want to be  
I don't want to be  
Gone  
  
You don't know my name  
You don't know my number  
You don't know my face at all (at all at all at all)  
We walk right past each other, every single day  
Like cold machines, we're marching on and on and on and on and on

Crazy little child  
Never got to see  
All the pretty things in life  
Had him put away  
Nothing they could say  
Could ever make the pieces fit  
  
Aw well, Daddy-o was rich  
Mama was a bitch  
Living wasn't easy in between  
Behind his silent scream  
Jackson in his teens  
Was planning his escape  
  
He was a crazy little child  
New Orleans Alley playground  
Grimy faced  
He watched the hookers cry  
Winos were his friends  
And when he talked to them  
They said, "Jackson, boy, they'll get you by and by"  
  
Depression settin' in  
Desp'rate, cool and quick  
Jackson learned the ropes out on the street  
Little candy stores  
Just pickin' locks and doors  
Was practice for a two bit petty thief  
  
So Jackson went to Ritz  
And ev'ryone was hip  
Ritz ran all the rackets there in town  
If you need another boy  
A trigger or a blade  
Well, I'm the slickest cat around  
  
Yeah, Ritz gave him the eye  
Once over, then he smiled  
"Yeah, I've got something here in mind  
If you meet me here at two  
I think you'll like the view  
Of that long green when you crack that safe tonight"  
  
He was a crazy little child  
New Orleans Alley playground  
And grimy faced  
He watched the hookers cry, whoo  
Winos were his friends  
And when he talked to them  
They said, "Jackson, boy, they'll get you by and by," that's right  
  
Well, I'll wait for you outside  
And I'll be your ears and your eyes  
And boy, you just slip in there and bring out all that loot  
But Ritz was taken by surprise  
Couple of unspectin' guys  
And they left poor Jackson inside  
  
Questions there were few  
In fact there were none  
When those Sheriff's bullets start to fly  
Lay dying on the floor  
With a smokin' forty four  
He said, "I must admit the winos were right"  
  
Crazy little child  
Never got to see  
All the pretty things in life  
We buried him today  
Nothing we could say  
Could ever make the pieces fit  
  
Yeah, I must admit the winos were right  
Oh, I must admit the winos were right  
Yes, his last words were  
I must admit the winos we-ere ri-ight

Da Da  
Da Da

Da Da  
Da Da  
Da Da  
Da Da  
Da Da  
  
I don't know what you mean about nasty feelings, it's  
  
Let me help you out of this, you were starting to feel a  
Certain way, violence, resentful.  
  
How do you know that? I told you? I told you that?  
  
That's right, remember yesterday?  
  
I don't want to talk about that, I don't want to talk about it.  
Let's talk about, uh, talk about something else. Ok?  
  
What would you like to talk about?  
  
Uh  
  
Tell me about your son.  
  
My son, yeah well, he took care of me. He's took care of me  
For a long, he still takes care of me. And she takes good, and  
She takes care of me. She takes, she takes good care of me.  
He takes care of me,  
Do you believe it  
I have a daughter too.  
  
You don't have a daughter.  
  
Yeah, I have a dauther, yeah.  
  
A son - you have a son, a son.  
  
No I, no I, all I have, I have  
I have a son, I have a son and a daughter, and a daughter.  
No, I have a son, daughter, daughter too, and a boy, and a boy  
  
Da Da  
Da Da  
  
I'm a little tired now  
  
Well that's alright, I think that's enough for today.  
  
I'm feeling rough and kinda hungry too.  
  
Da Da  
  
Who's my boy?

My liberated parents  
They are gonin' out tonight  
They read the hippest magazines  
They've loosened their uptights  
Dad's wearin' real tight Levis  
And some Gucci Tennis shoes  
He's got a T-shirt custom made for him  
Saying "Give me pot not booze"  
  
I get a kiss good-bye  
I get all numb and high  
From all the smoke left on their breath  
I smile and wish them well  
Then I pray like hell  
They go and dance themselves to death  
  
Mom's hair's all green and dirty  
She wears a high tech Devo Suit  
She changed her name to Xerox  
She hides Quaaludes in her boots  
Oh, me, I'm all real embarrassed  
When I hear the things they do  
They kinda compromise my social position  
And my cool-ativity is suffering too!  
  
I get a kiss good-bye  
I get all numb and high  
From all the smoke left on their breath  
I smile and wish them well  
Then I pray like hell  
They go and dance themselves to death  
  
Ahh dance, real hard  
I get a kiss good-bye  
I get all numb and high  
From all the smoke left on their breath  
I smile and wish them well  
Then I pray like hell  
They go and dance themselves to death  
  
Come on momma  
Come on daddy  
Come on skinny  
Come on fatty  
Shake it Martha  
Shake it Larry  
Shake it Mr. Coronary  
You gotta dance dance  
Come on and dance dance  
Dance til you're outta breath

Take another bite  
It'll be alright  
What's wrong will soon feel right  
Dangerous tonight  
  
Take another sip  
Let it kiss your lips  
And let a little drip on your thighs  
  
If you let me I'll untie your sensuality  
I'll open up your heart and satisfy my greed  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm dangerous, I'm a dying breed  
Poisonous like a centipede  
I'm capable of the foulest deed  
Dangerous at night  
I'm dangerous like a razorback  
Deadly like a heart attack  
Well, I don't bend and I don't crack  
Dangerous tonight  
  
Take another turn  
The rules have all been burned  
And you've got tricks to learn  
Dangerous tonight  
  
Play another role  
Try and lose control  
And stain your soul to red from white  
In my mind, oh, a million voices tell me no  
It's prime crime time and I gotta let it go  
  
I'm dangerous like a broken glass  
I'm a flesh fanatic psychopath  
I can cause you pain and make it last  
Dangerous tonight  
I'm dangerous when the sun goes down  
So cross yourself, don't fool around  
I'll drag your heart into the ground  
Dangerous tonight  
  
If you let me I'll untie your sensuality  
I'll open up your heart and satisfy my greed  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm dangerous like a broken glass  
I'm a blood bubonic psychopath  
I can cause you pain and make it last  
Dangerous tonight

We must complete the trip, try not to lose your grip  
No sight of solid ground and never look straight down  
  
Deeper, deeper, deeper, deeper  
  
Your claustrophobic brain sucking you down the drain  
The walls are closing in, the air is getting thin  
  
The elevator broke, it went right through the floor  
It left a burning hole, down and down and down we go  
We're in a deadly spin, hating this spin we're in  
We're helpless, panic grows, down and down and down we go  
  
Daylight is at an end, you'll never see again  
You'll soon embrace the sight, this cold eternal light  
  
The elevator broke, it went right through the floor  
It left a burning hole, down and down and down we go  
We're in a deadly spin, hating this spin we're in  
Our helpless panic grows, down and down and down we go  
  
The elevator broke, it went right through the floor  
It left a burning hole, down and down and down we go  
We're in a deadly spin, hating this spin we're in  
Our helpless panic grows, down and down and down we go  
  
The elevator broke, it went right through the floor  
It left a burning hole, down and down and down we go  
We're in a deadly spin, hating this spin we're in  
Our helpless panic grows, down and down and down we go

Well, I wake up burnin' in a soaking sweat  
My pillows are drippin' and the sheets are wet  
I jump out of bed and I turn on the light  
This happens to me every night  
Sometimes you turn into a snake with long black hair  
Then you turn into an angel, blonde and fair  
You can turn yourself blue and I don't care  
You can change your look  
You can change your race  
But it's always your touch  
And always your face  
  
[Chorus:]  
Dirty dreams  
How you want to do me  
Dirty dreams  
Let me get through  
Dirty dreams  
A triple X-rated movie starring me and you  
  
Well, I close my eyes  
And you open your lips  
There's a shock from my head to my fingertips  
I fall through a hole 'cause I can't get a grip  
The room starts to spin and the world starts to turn  
My heart catches fire and my bed starts to burn  
  
Dirty dreams  
How you want do me  
Dirty dreams  
Anything for you, babe  
Dirty dreams  
Technicolor movie starring me and you  
Make my dreams come true  
  
Shake my nights  
Rattle my sleep  
Roll my eyes, I'm in too deep  
  
[Chorus]

Yo yo yo, yo  
Yo yo yo, yo  
  
Here you are in the club, with your bottle full of blood  
You've got grill, you got bling but player you don't know a thing  
Put your hands in the air, stick 'em up like you don't care  
Face the wall, count to ten, we mow you down, reload again  
  
Oh no , here we go  
  
Disco who, disco what  
Get down on your knees, and keep your trap shut  
Disco this, disco that  
When disc-gos to hell, that's where we're at, where we're at  
  
Yo yo yo, yo  
Yo yo yo, yo  
  
Disco bloodbath  
(Disco bloodbath boogie fever)  
Boogie fever  
(Disco bloodbath boogie fever)  
Disco bloodbath  
(Disco bloodbath boogie fever)  
Boogie fever  
(Disco bloodbath boogie fever)  
  
Bodies here, bodies there, piles of bodies everywhere  
On the chairs, on the door, disco bloodbath on the floor  
Hear them yell, hear them scream, just like someones scary dream  
Dig a hole, push 'em in, tomorrow they'll be back again  
  
Oh no, here we go  
  
Disco who, disco what  
Get down on your knees, and keep your trap shut  
Disco this, disco that  
When disc-gos to hell, that's where we're at, where we're at  
  
Yo yo yo, yo  
Yo yo yo, yo  
  
Disco bloodbath  
(Disco bloodbath boogie fever)  
Boogie fever  
(Disco bloodbath boogie fever)  
Disco bloodbath  
(Disco bloodbath boogie fever)  
Boogie fever  
(Disco bloodbath boogie fever)  
  
We cleaned the house tonight (we cleaned the house tonight)  
We did our job (we did our job it's alright)  
We turned out all the lights okay  
  
We were sent to let them know (I think you really let 'em know)  
It was time to let them go (you know they really had to go)  
'Cause we're the ones who close the show okay

I said one day I'd find the game  
Well now you know I'm not insane  
You tried to take me for a ride  
Now all you feel is suicide  
We're two of a kind  
Take what you can find  
But don't blow your mind away  
You led me to another life  
Of work and pain and sacrifice  
I broke away from you somehow  
And look who's goin' through it now  
We're two of a kind  
Take what you can find  
But don't blow your mind away  
So now you know the reason why  
I'm laughing here and why you cry  
'cause you don't mean a thing no more  
And I'm just like I was before  
  

Don't tell me I should, I better, I can  
Don't talk old to me  
Don't shake that finger in my face no more  
'Cause I might bite it off and spit it on the floor  
Better get secure get my life insured  
Buy a house and car that run  
Better sell my bike, my leather coats  
Those city auto parts and all my guns  
Don't talk old to me  
(Don't talk old to me)  
Don't talk so old to me  
(Don't talk old to me)  
Don't talk old to me tonight, tonight  
(Don't talk old tonight)  
Don't tell me I should, I better, I can  
Don't talk old to me  
Don't shake that finger in my face no more  
'Cause I might bite it off and spit it on the floor  
Don't talk old to me  
(Don't talk old to me)  
Don't talk so old to me  
(Don't talk old to me)  
Don't talk old to me tonight, tonight  
(Don't talk old to tonight)  
Don't talk old to me  
(Don't talk old to me)  
Kill me psychologically  
(Psychologically)  
Don't talk old to me tonigh  
(Don't talk old tonight)  
Don't bark and I won't bite  
Won't bite, don't you bark  
Better get secure get my life insured  
Buy a house and car that runs  
Better sell my bike, my leather coat  
Those city auto parts and all my guns  
No fun, no fun, no fun  
No fun, no fun, no fun, fun, fun  
Don't talk old to me  
(Don't talk old to me)  
Don't talk so old to me  
(Don't talk old to me)  
Don't talk old to me tonight, tonight  
(Don't talk old to tonight)  
Don't talk old to me  
(Don't talk old to me)  
Kill me psychologically  
(Psychologically)  
Don't talk old to me tonight, tonight  
(Don't talk old to tonight)  
That's the last time I'll say please  
Don't you talk so old  
Don't talk old to me tonight  
Are you deaf, are you deaf  
I'm not gonna say it no more  
No, no, no, no, don't talk no old more  
Don't talk old  
Don't talk old  
No no, no  

Well, here you are lying bleeding on a grimy street  
See the broken glass sparkling darkly as it cuts your feet  
Smell the rotting stench, the rancid odor of old cantonese  
Feel the toxic flames all around you, you can hardly breathe  
Come with me  
  
Come on. I've got something to show you  
Come on. You thought that it was over  
Come on. You're really gonna love this

Far as you want to go, down in Dragontown  
  
Open any door, remember everyone you met before  
Oh. There's a wicked young man, cooking slowly the frying pan  
And our family of bones are back together sleeping all alone  
Then there's Alice, dear, and all the little things that got him here  
Now you're here  
  
Come on. I've got something to show you  
Come on. You thought that it was over  
Come on. You're really gonna love this  
Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.  
  
We can dig you a hole deep in the ground  
Bury your soul down in Dragontown  
We'll be lower than low, spiralin' down  
Far as you want to go down in Dragontown  
  
We can dig you a hole deep in the ground  
Bury your soul down in Dragontown  
We'll he lower than low, spiralin' down  
Far as you want to go down in Dragontown

Bury your soul down in Dragontown  
We'll he lower than low, spiralin' down  
Far as you want to go down in Dragontown

Sometimes my world goes upside down  
Sometimes I see things backwards  
When I go walking in town, can't get back home  
Someimes I see things right to left  
  
And I know that's not right at all  
But since I bumped into you, I bump into walls  
And no one knows what's wrong with me  
They think that I got dropsie  
  
Is dis love?  
Or is dyslexia  
Dyslexia

Just like the bottoms of coke bottles  
I stumble 'round my house, so strange to me

Sixty million tons of meat  
Spoiling in the stinking heat  
Train loads full of moldy bread  
Millions will still go unfed  
  
Acres full of dying wheat  
Burning brightly at our feet  
A billion tons of ocean fish  
Some with nothing on their dish  
  
We can't see, we're going blind  
We're just dying on the vine  
We're all sinking from the weight  
Open wide and salivate  
  
Do you like the taste?  
Stuff it in your face  
Its not nice to waste  
We're not happy 'til we're choking  
So we eat some more  
Throw up on the floor  
Go back to the store  
We're so hungry, so pathetic  
  
Lots of melting cheddar cheese  
Spreading it's unique disease  
Rotting veggies on the ground  
Where little hungry little kids are found  
  
Worms in fruit an ugly sight  
They're begging for a single bite  
Our garbage dumps are mountains high  
While other people sadly die  
  
We can't see we're going blind  
We're just dying on the vine  
We're all sinking from the weight  
Open wide and salivate  
  
Do you like the taste?  
Stuff it in your face  
Its not nice to waste  
We're not happy 'til we're choking  
So we eat some more

We're not happy 'til we're choking

We're so hungry, so pathetic

Lines form on my face and hands  
Lines form from the ups and downs  
I'm in the middle without any plans

Baby's brain and an old man's heart

Don't always know what I'm talkin' about  
Feels like I'm livin' in the middle of doubt  
Cause I'm  
  
Eighteen

Eighteen

Eighteen

Lines form on the left and right

The middle of life

You were so beautiful  
Like a child young and full of life  
Seems a hundred years ago  
You saw everything  
So much more tragedy than good  
You even watched the world grow cold  
And even when your world was shaken'  
Even when your breath was taken  
Even when your blue eyes turned to grey  
  
Small town debutantes and queens  
Every woman has a name  
Cocktail waitresses with dreams  
Every woman has a name  
And every girl who's loves survives  
A broken heart to stay alive  
You signed your picture in the frame  
Every woman has a name  
  
You had a love affair  
Some of were perfect  
but most of them were pain  
It seems a hundred years ago  
It took you to the highest hill  
Left you standing frozen in the rain  
But you still feel the afterglow  
And even when your world was shakin'  
Even when your breath was taken  
Even when your blue eyes turned to gray  
  
Housewives cryin' on the phone  
Every woman has a name  
Sacred sisters all alone  
Every woman has a name  
And even on the coldest day  
When the kids are gone, moved away  
It's lonely now  
There's no one there to hold your hand  
And play  
  
See it written on the grave  
Every woman has a name

I don't drink tea or white chablis  
I sit around and watch tv  
Don't send flowers or take showers  
But I'll be there to pull your weeds  
  
Oh yeah  
  
I don't read books, I don't french cook  
Or stroll around in galleries  
I hate opera, I hate Oprah  
Don't fill my head with poetry  
  
You just want to squeeze my masculinity  
Why can't you leave it alone  
  
Hey, hey I ain't gonna change  
Hey, hey don't you love it this way  
Hey, hey I am what I am  
So please understand, I'm not you fantasy man  
  
I don't do dishes and I'm suspicious  
Of any grown-up man who does  
I'm homophobic, don't do aerobics  
Just lay around and catch a buzz  
  
You just want to squeeze my masculinity  
Why can't you leave it alone  
  
Hey, hey I ain't gonna change  
Hey, hey don't you love it this way  
Hey, hey I am what I am  
So please understand

We the people of the United States  
In order to form a more perfect union  
  
Stop pretending that you've never been bad  
You're never wrong and you've never been dirty  
You're such a saint, that ain't the way we see you  
Ah, You want to rule us with an iron hand  
You change the lyrics and become Big Brother  
This ain't Russia, you ain't my Dad or Mother  
(They never knew anyway)  
'Cause I never walk away from what I know is right  
But I'm gonna turn my back on you  
  
Freedom, we're gonna ring the bell  
Freedom to rock, freedom to talk  
Freedom, raise your fist and yell  
Freedom to rock, freedom to talk  
Freedom - ring  
  
Aaaah  
You're playing God from your ivory tower  
Back off preacher, I don't care if it's Sunday  
I ain't no angel, but I've never felt better  
We're a make-up metal generation  
We're not as stupid as you want to make us  
You better leave us, man  
'Cause you sure can't take us  
Oh... Nobody better tell you how to live your life  
Or you gotta do it on your own  
  
Freedom, we're gonna ring the bell  
Freedom to rock, freedom to talk  
Freedom, raise your fist and yell  
Freedom to rock, freedom to talk  
Freedom - Yeah...  
  
Oh yeah  
'Cause I never walk away from what I know is right

All the neighbors never see me  
But they wonder why I walk around at night  
he gets hungry - I go hunting  
In the moonlit streets  
For somebody that's right  
  
Fresh blood, a sanguinary feast  
Is all he's living for  
And he craves it more and more  
Showgirls, businessmen in suits in the midnight rain  
If they walk alone are never seen again  
  
In the paper, seems a florist  
Found in Lincoln Park, died of some anemia  
No one raped her, poor Deloris  
Just detained her and drained her on the spot  
  
Fresh blood, a sanguinary feast  
Is all he's living for  
And he craves it more and more  
Old men, ladies of the night walking in the rain  
If they walk alone are never seen again  
  
Fresh blood it goes through me, flows through me  
Fresh blood inside of me, cry to me  
Fresh blood it goes through me, flows through me  
Fresh blood inside of me, cry to me  
  
No one calls and no one visits  
We're like a couplet out of Desolation Row  
We don't want them to want to know us  
Cause when they do, they get a little bit too close  
  
Fresh blood, a sanguinary feast is all I'm living for  
and I crave it more and more  
Bad girls, cops on the beat in the midnight rain  
If they're out alone, are never seen again  
  
Fresh blood it goes through me, flows through me  
Fresh blood inside of me, cry to me  
Fresh blood it goes through me, flows through me  
Fresh blood inside of me, cry to me  
Fresh blood it goes through me, flows through me  
Fresh blood inside of me, cry to me  
Fresh blood it goes through me, flows through me  
Fresh blood inside of me, cry to me  
Fresh blood it goes through me, flows through me  
Fresh blood inside of me, cry to me, cry to me  
Fresh blood it goes through me, flows through me  
Fresh blood inside of me, cry to me, cry to me

I got lost on the road somewhere was it texas or was it Canda Dinking whiskey
in the morning light I work the stage all night long at first we laughed about
it my long haired drunken friends  
Proposed a toast to Jimmy's ghost  
I never Dreamed that I would wind up on the losing end I'm stuck here on the
inside looking out I'm just another case Where's my make up where's my face on
the inside All got you kicks from what you saw up there Eight bucks even buys
a folding chair I was downing seagrams on another flight and I worked that
stage all night long You were screaming for the villain up there and i was
much obliged the old road sure screwed me good this time It's hard to see
where the vicious circle ends I'm stuck here on the inside looking out that's
no big discrace where's my makeup where's' my face on the inside

Please clean your plate dear  
The Lord above can see you  
Don't you know people are starving in Korea  
  
Alcohol and razor blades and poison and needles  
Kindergarten people, they use them, they need them  
  
The over-indulgent machines were their children  
There wasn't a way down on Earth here to cool them  
'Cause they looked just like humans  
At Kresge's and Woolworth's  
But decadent brains were at work to destroy  
Rats in batallions were ruling the street scene  
Generation landslide  
Closed the gap between 'em  
  
And I laughed to myself at the men and the ladies  
Who never conceived of us billion dollar babies  
  
Militant mothers hiding in their basements  
Using pots and pans as their shields and their helmets  
  
Molotov milk bottles heaved from pink high chairs  
While Mother's Lib burned birth certificate papers  
Dad gets his allowance from his sonny the dealer  
Who's pubic to the world but involved in high finance  
  
Sister's out till five doing banker's son's hours  
But she owns a Maserati that's a gift from his father  
  
Stopped at full speed at one hundred miles per hour  
  
The Colgate invisible shield finally got 'em  
  
But I laughed to myself at the men and the ladies  
  
Who never conceived of us billion dollar babies

We're gonna have a bash and we're glad you finally got here  
'Cause we're already trashed and the band is really hot, yeah  
We're gonna dance our heads off and we're gonna keep it tight  
If we keep ourselves together, we might make it through the night  
  
Ghouls gone wild, wilder than before  
We had a little taste and now we need a little more  
Ghouls gone wild, screamin' in the night  
We're feelin' kinda hungry and we came in for a bite  
  
Ghouls  
(Ooh-wah, ooh-wah)  
Ghouls  
(Ooh-wah, ooh-wah)  
  
We're gonna raise some hell, yeah, we're gonna rock and roll here  
And the sulfur that you smell, well, it adds a little soul there  
We're dancin' on your grave and we're dancin' in the street  
We're dancin' through the fire and it's burnin' up our feet  
(Burnin' up our feet)  
  
Ghouls gone wild  
(Ghouls gone wild)  
Wilder than before

When we're biting

Come on and play  
What do ya say?  
  
Ghouls gone wild

[Alice]  
Don't know why I'm down here  
Must be something I said  
Or some small imperfection  
In my soul or in my head  
Don't know why I'm down here  
Don't deserve to roast or bake  
I'm fighting off slanderous allegations  
Why don't you give the kid a break?  
  
[Alice]  
Don't think maybe we could talk this over  
You're a reasonable man  
Could we discuss my grave situation  
I'm a miserable man  
And I'm in the frying pan  
Give the kid a break (continues over dialog)  
  
Devil: Give me one good reason why I should  
Alice: All right, all right, so I made a few mistakes but listen.. But for
heaven's sake  
Devil: Watch your language, Kid.  
Alice: OK, OK, don't get hot  
  
[Devil]  
Don't question my judgement  
He only reaped what he sowed  
He cast his pearls before swine  
And that's good enough for me  
  
[Devil]  
I don't want to talk it over  
Even tho' I'm a reasonable man  
Sonny, from over here looks like you're in no position to bargain  
You're a convicted man  
You're right in the frying pan  
  
Give the kid a break (continues over dialog  
  
Alice: Yeah, Please give me a break  
Devil: Nah, I don't think so, man  
Alice: Come on, you know I got what it takes. Can't you give me a break?  
Devil: Sure thing kid, when hell freezes over  
Choir: Ok, don't give the kid a break  
Alice: Hey you guys, I thought you were on my side  
Choir: No. Give the kid a break  
Alice: Yeah, well thanks a lot, pals  
Alice: Listen boss, maybe we can make a little deal. Is there anything I can
say, some kind of fine I can pay? Anything?  
  
[Alice:  
Don't know why I'm down here  
Must be something I said (I'm sorry)  
Or some small imperfection  
In my soul or in my head  
It might be some sort of imperfection  
It might be a defection or a, a clear case of misdirection yeah  
It must be a small imperfection  
In my soul or in my head  
Give the kid a break

For criminal acts and violence on the stage  
For being a brat, refusing to act your age  
For all of the decent citizens you've enraged  
You can go to Hell  
  
For gambling and drinking alcohol constantly  
For making us doubt our parents authority  
For choosing to be a living obscenity  
You can go to Hell  
  
You're something that never should have happened  
You even make your Grandma sick  
  
You'd poison a blind man's dog and steal his cane  
You'd gift wrap a leper and mail him to your Aunt Jane  
You'd even force feed a diabetic a candy cane  
You can go to Hell  
  
You're something that never should have happened  
You even make your Grandma sick  
  
For criminal acts and violence on the stage  
For being a brat, refusing to act your age  
For all of the decent citizens you've enraged  
You can go to Hell

I'm going home  
There I am there, in my bedroom  
I'm safe and I'm snug and snoring  
And so glad to be there.  
  
I'm going home  
None of this ever happened  
But, God, I really did it  
Still nothing has changed.  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm going home  
I'm going home  
To my own room  
To all the mess  
To all the dirty laundry  
It looks so good I don't care  
I'm just so glad to be home, sweet home  
  
Wonder if anyone missed me?  
Or have I been gone so far  
They thought that I died  
How many said  
I wonder what happened to Alice?  
How many shrugged, or laughed,  
How many cried,  
But I don't give a damn!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm going home  
Nothing can stop me now  
(repeat)

He was born in a depressed nation  
Started tough and worked his way right off the street  
Thumbed his nose at a graduation  
Wheeled and dealed, his education was complete  
  
He's got all his hair, but his life is a wreck  
Always been a brat, he don't get no respect  
He's got the time, he's got the money  
You better get out of his way  
You better watch out for him, sonny  
  
Back to school  
He's gonna take that plunge  
Gonna jump back in there  
Back to school  
He's gonna shape his mind  
Gonna shed old skin there  
Back to school  
  
Spent some time in appreciation of finer arts  
And the human body mysteries  
Scoring high in procreation  
Got an 'A' in the study of female anatomy  
  
He thinks about his teacher in his literary class  
He's staring at her legs  
But he's dreaming 'bout her face  
He's got the time  
He's got the money  
You better get out of his way  
You better watch out for him, sonny  
  
Back to school  
He's gonna take that plunge  
Gonna jump back in there  
Back to school  
He's gonna shape his mind  
Gonna shed old skin there  
Back to school

The boy's got problems  
The boy's got stress  
The boys' a .38 hidden in his desk  
The boy's got a chickie  
With four months to go  
Grim Facts - every parent better know  
  
The girl's a deadly teaser  
Wants to do a private show  
She's got a hundred thousand fantasies  
She wants the band to know  
She likes to brush across my Levis  
She likes to watch him grow  
Grim Facts - every parent better know  
Grim Facts - every parent better know  
  
[Chorus]  
Red lights - Gang fights  
Brewing in the heat  
Cop cars - Gay bars  
On your precious street  
That ain't so neat  
  
Sister's on the street now  
Looking for some Joe  
Only got about an hour  
To pay for her new nose  
She gets a hundred for her body  
A nickel for her soul  
These are grim facts - every parent must know  
Grim facts - every parent must know  
  
[Chorus]  
Red lights - Gang fights  
Brewing in the heat  
Cop cars - Gay bars  
On your precious street  
That ain't so neat  
  
And I'm feeling itchy  
Got a fire down below  
I'm a walkin loaded time bomb  
Just about to blow  
Tries to slide inside my pockets  
But it's strictly SRO  
Grim facts - every parent gonna know  
Grim facts - every parent gonna know  
  
[Chorus]  
Red lights - Gang fights  
Brewing in the heat  
Cop cars - Gay bars  
On your precious street  
That ain't so neat  
  
Mmm Grim facts, you know, growing all the time  
Mmm Grim facts, real grim Yeah

Alice Cooper - Guilty  
Just tried to have fun  
Raise hell and then some  
I'm a dirt talkin', beer drinkin' woman chasing minister's son  
  
Slap on the makeup  
Blast out the music  
Wake up the neighbors with a roar  
like a teenage heavy metal elephant gun.  
  
If you call that Guilty,..  
Then that's what I am  
I'm Guilty,..I'm Guilty!  
  
Like driving too fast  
Love going too far  
It seems the law's on my ass every time  
I stick it out of the door  
  
If you call that guilty,  
Then that's what I am!  
I'm guilty,..I'm guilty  
  
Bad boy on a summer night  
When the heat makes me mean and I want to fight  
Put my pedal on the metal and I do what I want to do  
Bad girls make me feel all right  
  
When it's hot and they start screamin' in the night  
Golly Gee, it's wrong to be,..  
so guilty! (I'm guilty)  
  
My conscience is on vacation  
In acute degeneration  
Willpower has sunk to an all time low  
  
If you call that guilty.,.  
Well then I guess I am..  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
I'm guilty,..I'm guilty!  
  
I'm guilty,..and I don't care,..  
I'm guilty, and I think I've been framed anyway,...

Gather round right now and hear me whisper  
The words of the prison, the words of laughter  
The lords and the ladies were fixing their hair-dos  
Cursing their lovers  
cursing the Bible  
  
Hallow-ed by my name  
Yelling at fathers  
Screaming at mothers  
Hallow-ed by my name  
  
Come all you sinners, come now in your glory  
And my ears will listen to your dirty stories  
You're fighting to go up, 'cause you're on your way down  
Cursing their lovers  
Cursing the Bible  
  
Hallow-ed by my name  
Yelling at fathers  
Screaming at mothers  
Hallow-ed by my name  
  
Sluts and the hookers have taken your money  
The queens are out dancing but now they're not funny  
'Cause there goes one walkin' away with your sonny  
Cursing their lovers  
Cursing the Bible  
  
Hallow-ed by my name  
Yelling at fathers  
Screaming at mothers  
Hallow-ed by my name

I've got the answers  
To all of your questions  
If you've got the money  
To pay me in gold  
I will be living  
In old Monte Carlo  
And you will be reading  
The secrets of soul  
Daggers and contacts  
And bright shiny limos  
I've got a watch  
That turns into a lifeboat  
Glimmering nightgowns  
And poisonous cobras  
Silencer under the heel of my shoe  
The elegance of China  
They sent her to lie here on her back  
But as she deeply moves me  
She'd rather shoot me in my tracks  
And while a Middle Asian lady  
She really came as no surprise  
But I still did destroy her  
And I will smash  
Halo of flies  
I crossed the ocean  
Where no one could see  
And I put a time-bomb  
In your submarine  
Goodbye to old friends  
The secret's in hand  
With full ream of papers  
And fantastic plans  
You never will understand

Life  
Coast to coast  
White hot as a ghost  
When you live  
In a countdown  
  
Time  
Is free as a jailbird  
At least that's what I heard  
When you live  
In a hideout  
  
Love  
Comes cheap at a swapmeet  
It all comes so dirt cheap  
When you live  
In a bedroom  
  
Love  
Cuts deep as a razor  
But that ain't amazin'  
When you live  
In a cancer  
  
Ah-ah-ah  
Ah-ah-ah  
Ah-ah-ah  
Ah-ah-ah  
Ah  
  
Mind  
Gets scrambled like eggs  
Get bruised and erased  
When you live  
In a brainstorm  
  
Noise  
Seems logically right  
Ringing ears in the night  
When you live  
In an airport  
  
Ah-ah-ah  
Ah-ah-ah  
Ah-ah-ah  
Ah-ah-ah  
Ah  
  
Hard hearted Alice  
Is what we want to be  
Hard hearted Alice  
Is what you want to see  
  
Hard hearted Alice  
Is what we want to be  
Hard hearted Alice  
Is what you want to see

I'm a rock and roll vagabond  
I'm a streetwise runaway  
Sixteen when I left home  
And I don't regret it a single day  
I'm a sucker for a loud guitar  
Got one tatooed on my chest  
It's hot July  
My mouth's too dry  
  
You know I'll be screamin  
Hard rock summer  
Hard rock summer  
  
...  
...  
Hard rock summer in the USA  
  
Hard rock summer in the USA  
  
Got a job  
It was so damn hard  
Just workin' for the man  
All year long I saved my pay  
And I stashed it in a rusty can  
...  
And blew my head  
Then he blew me out of town  
I parked my van at the L.A. sand  
California screamin'  
Hard rock summer  
Hard rock summer  
  
Rock all night  
Gonna blow this town  
Til morning light  
Going round and round  
Hard rock summer in the USA

Hello! Hooray! Let the show begin,  
I've been ready.  
Hello! Hooray! Let the lights grow dim,  
I've been ready.  
  
Ready as this audience that's coming here to dream.  
Loving every second, ev'ry moment, ev'ry scream,  
I've been waiting so long to sing my song  
And I've been waiting so long for this thing to come.  
Yeah - I've been thinking so long I was the only one.

Ready as this audience that's coming here to dream.  
Loving every second, ev'ry moment, ev'ry scream,

And I've been waiting so long for this thing to come.  
Yeah - I've been thinking so long I was the only one.

I'm so strong.  
I feel so strong.  
So strong.  
God, I feel so strong,

Hey bro, take it slow  
You ain't livin' in a video  
You're flying low with a high velocity  
No doubt, you're stressin' out  
That ain't what rock n' roll's about  
Get off that one way trip down lonely street  
  
Now I know you've been kicked around  
You ain't alone in this ugly town  
You stick a needle in your arm  
You bite the dust, you buy the farm  
  
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey stoopid  
What ya tryin' to do  
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey stoopid  
They win you lose  
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey stoopid  
  
C'mon girl, it's a better day  
Get your foot out of that grave  
Don't let that one love tear your world apart  
C'mon babe, kick that stuff  
Show the street it ain't so tough  
Quit lyin' around with a crippled, broken heart  
  
Now I know you've been seeing red  
Don't put a pistol to your head  
Sometimes your answer's heaven sent  
Your way is so damn permanent  
  
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey stoopid  
What ya tryin' to do  
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey stoopid  
They win you lose  
Hey, hye, hey, hey, hey stoopid  
  
This ain't your daddy talkin'  
You know, I know  
Your story ain't so shocking  
You know, I know  
Blow some steam  
C'mon and scream  
  
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey stoopid  
What ya tryin' to do  
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey stoopid  
They win you lose  
Hey, hye, hey, hey, hey stoopid

Dear darlin' surprised to hear from me?  
Bet you're sittin' drinkin' coffee, yawnin' sleepily  
Just to let you know  
I'm gonna be home soon  
I'm kinda awkward and afraid  
Time has changed your point of view  
  
How you gonna see me now  
Please don't see me ugly babe  
'Cause I know I let you down  
In oh so many ways  
How you gonna see me now  
Since we've been on our own  
Are you gonna love the man  
When the man gets home  
  
Listen darlin' now I'm heading for the west  
Straightened out my head but my old heart is still a mess  
Yes I'm worried honey  
Guess that's natural though  
It's like I'm waiting for a welcome sign  
Like a hobo in the snow  
  
How you gonna see me now  
Please don't see me ugly babe  
'Cause I know I let you down  
In oh so many ways  
How you gonna see me now  
Since we've been on our own  
Are you gonna love the man  
When the man gets home  
  
And just like the first time  
We're just strangers again  
I might have grown out of style  
In the place I've been  
And just like the first time  
I'll be shakin' inside  
When I walk in the door  
There'll be no place to hide  
  
How you gonna see me now  
Please don't see me ugly babe  
'Cause I know I let you down  
In oh so many ways  
How you gonna see me now  
Since we've been on our own  
Are you gonna love the man  
When the man gets home  
  

I got a ticket to nowhere  
I got no respect for the law  
I got no use 'cause it's all abuse  
It's the cutting edge of the saw  
  
Ain't got no tiime for the future  
Ain't got no time for the past  
I'm running up a down escalator  
I'm going nowhere fast  
  
I'm hanging on like a spider  
Blowing in the wind  
This storm's gonna tear a hole  
Right through this web I'm in  
  
[Chorus:]  
Thunder lightning  
The wind outside is so damn frightening  
But it's alright, all right  
Stand clear  
You're living in the hurricane years  
In the hurricane years  
  
I've been through major destruction  
I've seen through terrorists' eyes  
Sometims I feel no emotion  
Sometims I break down and cry  
I need to walk on a wire  
I need a layer of skin  
I need a preacher breathing fire  
To burn away my sins  
  
And I can't help the victims  
On the side of the road  
And I can't stop the cyclone  
That's about to explode  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Turn my eyes to heaven  
Watching all the clouds roll by  
I see the blood moon rising  
I know I'm way too young to die  
  
[Chorus]

I was just a shadow  
In the beginning  
I was alone  
  
In the beginning, I was blind  
Living in a world devoid of light  
In the beginning  
There was only night  
  
I was shattered  
Left in pieces  
And I felt so cold inside  
Then I called you  
From the darkness  
Where I hide  
  
I am made of you  
I am made of you  
I am made of you  
I am made of you  
  
In the beginning  
You were evolution  
A river of salvation  
And now I believe  
  
All I wanted  
All I needed  
Was someone to rescue me  
I was drownin'  
I was dying  
Now I'm free  
  
I am made of you  
I am made of you  
I am made of you  
I am made of you  
  
Here I am now  
I can stand now  
'Cause your love has made me strong  
And forever  
You're the singer  
I'm the song  
  
I am made of you  
I am made of you  
I am made of you  
I am made of you  
I am made of you  
I am made of you  
I am made of you  
I am made of you

When does a dream become a nightmare?  
When do we do what must be done?  
When do we stand and face the future?  
When there is nowhere left to run?  
  
And you've got to learn  
Just how to survive  
You've got to learn  
How to keep your dream alive  
  
Take a look at my face  
I am the future  
How do you like what you see?  
Take a look at my face  
I belong to the future  
And you belong to me  
  
When does a dream become a nightmare?  
When do we learn to live with fear?  
When we cry out for some salvation?  
Why is it no one seems to hear?  
  
You've got to learn  
It's up to you  
If you can learn  
That the dream just might come true  
  
Take a look at my face  
I am the future  
How do you like what you see?  
Take a look at my face  
I belong to the future  
The world belongs to me, yeah  
  
Take a look at my face  
I am the future  
Now, how do you like what you see?  
Take a look at my face  
I belong to the future  
And the world it belongs to me  
It belongs to me  
  
It's all mine  
Just take a look at my face  
I'm the future, no disgrace  
Take a look at my face  
This world belongs to... To me

Now, let me take you babe, down to the river bed  
Well, I got to tell you something that'll go right to your head  
I got a line on you babe  
I got a line on you babe  
Yeah, I got a line on you  
I got a line on you babe  
Now, put your arms around me, every little bit of your love  
Oh, you know what to do, I'll make love to you  
You got the right stuff, and I do to  
I got a line on you babe  
I got a line on you babe  
Yeah, I got a line on you  
I got a line on you babe  
I got my eye on you babe, on your velvet skin  
I want to put my hands were they've never been  
Get real hot in the midnight steam  
Soaking in the rain in my favorite dream  
Your lips are red, the moon is blue  
I only ask you once what you want to do  
Gonna touch you babe 'til the night is through  
Look out honey, got a line on you  
The winter's almost over, the summer she's coming on strong.  
I want to love you, love you, love you, love you all year long  
I got a line on you babe  
I got a line on you babe  
Yeah, I got a line on you  
I got a line on you babe  
Ah yeah!  
I got a line on you babe  
I got a line on you babe  
Yeah, I got a line on you  
Yeah, yeah, yeah!  
I got a line on you babe  
I got a line on you babe  
I got a line on you  
I got a line on you babe

If there is a tear on my face  
It makes me shiver to the bones  
It shakes me, Babe  
It's just a heartache that got in my eye  
And you know I never cry, I never cry  
Sometimes I drink more than I need  
Until the TV's dead and gone  
I may be lonely  
But I'm never alone  
And the night may pass me by  
But I'll never cry  
Take away, take away my eyes  
Sometimes I'd rather be blind  
Break a heart, break a heart of stone  
Open it up but don't you leave it alone  
'cause that's all I got to give you  
Believe me Babe, it ain't been used  
My heart's a virgin, its never been tried  
And you know I'll never cry  
And you know I'll never cry  
And you know I'll never cry  
Never cry, I'll never cry  
Break a heart, break a heart of stone  
'cause that's all I got to give you  
Believe me Babe, it ain't been used  
My heart's a virgin, its never been tried  
And you know I'll never cry  
Never cry  
I'll never cry

Sometimes I'm James Bond  
Sometimes I'm Billy The Kid  
Sometimes I feel like Sherlock Holmes  
Sometimes I feel like Jack The Ripper  
  
'Cause I got an image out of control  
Identity crisisis  
I don't need a new face  
'Cause mine's been erased  
Identity crisisis  
  
Sometimes I'm on a case  
Sometimes I'm shooting bad dudes  
Sometimes I'm slashing the face  
Sometimes I'm looking for clues  
Sometimes I'm braking the law  
Sometimes I'm solving a crime  
I'm always fast on the draw  
I get the girls all the time  
  
'Cause I got an image out of control  
Identity crisisis  
I don't need a new face  
'Cause mine's been erased  
Identity crisisis  
  
Sometimes I'm James Bond  
Sometimes I'm Billy The Kid  
Sometimes I feel like Sherlock Holmes  
Sometimes I feel like Jack The Ripper  
  
'Cause I got an image out of control  
Identity crisisis  
I don't need a new face  
'Cause mine's been erased  
Identity crisisis  
  
'Cause I got an image out of control  
Identity crisisis  
I don't need a new face  
'Cause mine's been erased  
Identity crisisis

She was a dirty dream cool and clean  
With seduction dancing in her eyes  
She turned around looked me up and down  
She took me by surprise  
  
I tried to run tried to hide  
But my feet were made of clay  
Looked in her eyes I was paralyzed  
I just couldn't get away  
  
She licked her lips they were bloody red  
She had the heart of the living dead  
She pushed me down on a burning bed  
Thought I was in heaven but instead  
She turned her head and she softly said  
  
I'll bite your face off  
I'll bite your face off  
I'll bite your face off little man  
I'll bite your face off you know that I can  
  
She put the whip into cream  
She was a sinners queen oh a delicious angel face  
She'd invite you in c'mon and lick my skin  
You'd sell your soul for another taste  
  
She took my heart my resistance fled  
I loved each lie that I was fed  
She pushed me down on a burning bed  
Thought I was in heaven but instead  
She turned her head and she softly said  
  
I'll bite your face off  
I'll bite your face off  
I'll bite your face off little man  
I'll bite your face off you know that I can  
  
She pushed me down on a burning bed  
Thought I was in heaven but instead  
She turned her head and she softly said  
  
I'll bite your face off  
I'll bite your face off  
I'll bite your face off little man  
I'll bite your face off you know that I can  
  
I'll bite your face off  
I'll bite your face off  
I'll bite your face off  
I'll bite your face off

At the end of the rainbow, there's happiness  
And to find it how often I've tried  
But my life is a race, just a wild goose chase  
and all my dreams have been denied  
  
Why have I always been a failure  
What can the reason be  
I wonder if the world's to blame  
I wonder if it could be me  
  
I'm always chasing rainbows  
Watching clouds drifting by  
My schemes are just like all my dreams  
Ending in the sky  
  
Some fellows look and find the sunshine  
I always look and find the rain  
And some fellows make a winning sometime  
And I never even make a gain  
  
I'm always chasing rainbows  
Waiting to find the little bluebird in vain.

I'm Flash, I'm the hero  
I'm the bopper who's the poppa of the crew  
I'm Flash, and I fight evil  
And my spaceship flies the red, white and blue  
I'm Flash, like a streaker  
You'll find me cruising out among the stars  
And I'm feared by every outlaw  
And every renegade from Jupiter to Mars  
The jails are full in Saturn and I can tell you why  
'Cause I'm the full-blasting, protoblasting hero of the sky  
On Mars the smugglers starve no matter what they try  
'Cause I'm the everlasting, flabber-ghasting guy who's flying high  
I'm Flash, yeah, I'm the hero  
From the starspangled U.S of A  
I believe in packin' punchin' power  
And hitting fast 'cause that's the only way  
I'm Flash  
I'm Flash, and I'm a mover  
My spaceship glides at twice the speed of light  
I'm Flash, and I'm a He-Man  
I'm a six foot one inch block of dynamite  
I'm Flash, in shining armor  
And I love to rescue damsels in distress  
And my wave length is always open so I can answer any call of S.O.S  
I've been in trouble of the worst kind ever since I left the womb  
I'm a death defying, terrifying spotlight in the gloom  
When you see me coming, boys, just give me lots of room  
'Cause I'm the liquifying, crucifying harbinger of doom  
I'm Flash, I'm the hero  
I'm the bopper who's the poppa of the crew  
I'm Flash, and I fight evil  
And my spaceship flies the red, white and blue  
You know, my spaceship flies the red, white and blue  
I said, my spaceship flies the starspangled red, white and blue  
I'm Flash, spelled F L A S H  
  

I got a head full of faces, a heart full of pain  
I got some bad ideas feeding my brain  
I got a night full of promise, a city full of prey  
Looks like everything is going my way  
I got an eye for the beauties and a mouth full of charm  
I got a tongue dripping poison tattooed on my arm  
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme something to eat  
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme something so sweet  
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme something to chew  
Something soft and tender, how 'bout you?  
I'm hungry  
I'm hungry  
Yeah, I'm hungry  
Oh, I'm hungry  
I got a smile for the lady that goes on my face  
I got a kiss on my lips that leads to my place  
I got a bed in my basement fit for two  
I got some chloroform and handcuffs just for you  
I'm hungry  
I'm hungry  
Yeah, I'm hungry  
Oh, I'm hungry  
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme something to eat  
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme something so sweet  
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme something to chew  
Something soft and tender, how 'bout you?  
I'm hungry  
I'm hungry  
Yeah, I'm hungry  
Oh, I'm hungry  

I'm so angry  
I'm so angry  
Something that you said burnin' in my head  
I'm so angry  
I'm so angry  
Everything you do makes me furious with you  
  
It's like a poison to me  
It's like you put me in shock  
You stick a needle in me  
Every time that you talk  
  
I'm so angry  
I'm so stupid  
Everything you say, I believe it anyway  
I'm so stupid  
I'm so angry  
Running after you, that's what I gotta do  
  
It's like a poison to me  
It's like you put me in shock  
You stick a needle in me  
Every time that you talk  
  
Is there any one at all  
Any one you didn't call  
Is there any one you didn't deny  
Is there any one you missed  
Any one you didn't kiss  
Is there any law you didn't defy  
  
I'm so crazy  
I'm so crazy  
I used to be so cool, now I'm just your little fool  
I'm so crazy  
I'm so crazy  
Talking in my sleep like a scary little creep  
  
It's like a poison to me  
It's like you put me in shock  
You stick a needle in me  
Every time that you talk  
  
Is there any one at all  
Anyone you didn't call  
Is there any one you didn't deny  
Is there any one you missed  
Anyone you didn't kiss  
Is there any law you didn't defy  
  
I'm so angry  
I'm so angry  
Always chewing nails, it never, ever fails  
I'm so angry  
I'm so angry  
Better hide my knife, better run for your life  
  
So Angry  
So Angry  
I'm so angry  
Angry, angry, angry etc.

You know that I'm the coolest that's ever come around  
You'll notice things get hotter whenever I'm in town  
I mean, I gotta be the coolest, who else could it be?  
Everybody knows who's really cool  
Me  
  
Let's face it, I'm the greatest, I'm Mr. Number One  
My hometown built a statue to their favorite son  
I mean I gotta be the greatest  
I'm just a ball of fun  
I mean I'm definitely the greatest  
I'm also the coolest  
  
You can't leave a package like me sitting on no shelf  
Let me tell you I'm so cool sonny  
I'm gonna save a little for myself  
  
Yeah baby, come over here a minute  
Who is the coolest?  
I mean how do I look?  
Yeah  
  
You can't leave a package like me sitting on no shelf  
Let me tell you I'm so cool sonny  
I'm gonna save a little for myself  
  
You know the day I was born there were these four dudes up on a hill  
They said they saw this star hanging out over town  
And the whole world seemed to stand still  
It made the Sunday papers  
I guess it proves for sure  
I am the coolest  
I am the greatest  
I am the baddest  
I am the smoothest  
I'm just the best  
Sand dancer come on  
Ah yeah  
  
Right

Your momma thinks I'l filthy (all right)  
Your daddy thinks I'm scum (all right)  
Wrap your fingers all around me, I'm your g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-gun....  
  
Well...  
I'm dressed in black  
I'm a heart attack  
And my draw is lightning quick  
If you're looking for a man with magic hands  
I can really do the trick  
And if you see me on the street  
And you're burnin' from the heat  
There's a fire down below  
You be the target on the bed  
I'll be shootin' hot lead  
Let me take control  
  
You're a scared little girl in this big, bad town  
(You.......... need............. some............... one)  
So easy to sink, so easy to drown  
(Who will be strong)  
  
Pull my trigger, I get bigger  
Then I'm lots of fun  
I'm your gun  
I'm your gun, gun, gun  
Bite my bullet  
Push an' pull it  
Tell me I'm the one

Hold on steady, always ready, yeah  
  
Well, I'm as hard as they come  
I'm a hit and run  
I'm a pistol packin' boy  
Better walk real slow  
I'm on the edge, why'know  
And I'm easily annoyed  
If something's giving you trouble  
I'll be there on the double  
Just call me on the line  
I've got a muscle I can flex  
It'll fog your little specs  
Till you think you're going blind  
  
I know these streets like the scars on my back  
(You.......... need............. some............... one)  
And I stay as loaded as this gun on my back  
(Who..........will................. be.....................strong)  
  
Pull my trigger, I get bigger  
Then I'm lots of fun

This is gettin' fun  
I'm your gun  
I'm your gun, gun, gun  
Hold on steady (Hold on)  
Always ready, yeah

It's not like we did something wrong  
We just burned down the church  
While the choir within sang religious songs  
And it's not like we thought we was right  
We just played with the wheels of a passenger train  
That cracked on the tracks one night  
It's not like we ain't on the ball  
We just talk to our shrinks  
Huh, they talk to their shrinks  
No wonder we're up the wall  
We're not stupid or dumb  
We're the lunatic fringe who rusted the hinge  
On Uncle Sam's daughters and sons  
Good old boys and girls  
Congregating, waiting in another world  
With roller coaster brains  
Imagine playing with trains  
Good old boys and girls  
Congregating, waiting in some other world  
We're all crazy, we're all crazy, we're all crazy  
Lizzy Borden took an axe and gave her mother forty whacks  
And don't think we're trying to be bad  
All the innocent crime seemed alright at the time  
Not necessarily mad, not necessarily mad  
We watch every day for the bus  
And the driver would say  
"That's where lunatics stay"  
I wonder if he's talking about us  
It's not like we're vicious or gone  
We just dug up the graves where your relatives lay  
In old forest lawn  
And it's not like we don't know the score  
We're the fragile elite they dragged off the street  
I guess they just couldn't take us no more  
Good old boys and girls  
Congregating, waiting in another world  
With roller coaster brains  
Imagine digging up graves  
Good old boys and girls  
Congregating, waiting in some other world  
We're all crazy, we're all crazy, we're all crazy, we're all crazy  
We're all crazy, we're all crazy, we're all crazy, we're all crazy  
We're all crazy

Talking in my sleep, next to no one  
Never never, say never again  
I can't rise and shine  
No I won't even try  
  
My rainy windows are crying crying  
Shoulda, woulda, coulda been  
Like it shoulda been  
A contender like Marlon Brando  
  
Eani Meani Minei Mo  
Caught a virus won't let go  
Been down so long it looks like up to me  
I'm so lonely, I can almost taste it  
  
In a perfect world, I'd just be wasted  
Send me an angel, wrap me in her wings  
Hello, Hello, Hello.  
Is anyone home?  
  
Well, people love to talk  
When I can hardly walk  
To them I'm probably just the "News at Eleven"  
It's the edge of night  
  
As the world turns  
Misunderstood it's just the wrong medication  
I wish, I wish, upon a star  
I wish it hadn't gone this far  
  
Been up so long it looks like down to me  
I'm so lonely, I can almost taste it  
In a perfect world, I'd just be wasted  
Send me an angel, wrap me in her wings  
  
Hello, Hello, Hello.  
Is anyone home?  
Hello, Hello.  
I'm really really wasted  
  
I live in a big doll house  
And nobody's home  
Just me and my mouse  
I live in a big dark house  
  
And nobody's home  
Just me and my mouse  
I'm so lonely, I can almost taste it  
In a perfect world, I'd just be wasted  
  
Send an angel, my own little angel  
Hello, Hello.  
Is anyone home?  
Is anyone home?  
  
Hello, Hello  
Is anyone home?  
Hello, Hello, Hello  
Is anyone home?  
  
Hello, Hello  
Is anyone home?  
Hello, Hello, Hello  
Is anyone home?  
  
Hello, Hello, Hello  
Is anyone home?  
Hello, Hello, Hello  
Is anyone home?

What have I got  
That makes you want to love me  
Now is it my body  
Someone I might be  
Somethin' inside me  
  
You better tell me  
Tell me  
It's really up to you  
Have you got the time to find out  
Who I really am

To get inside of your mind  
Give me a break, yeah, yeah

Tell me  
It's really up to you  
Have you got the time to find out  
Who I really am  
Oh

You took a first-class trip to Paris  
You danced in the streets of Spain  
You followed the sun to Rio de Janeiro  
Cuz you got so sick and tired of the  
London rain  
But honey, late at night  
When you close your tired eyes  
You'll be there  
And I'll be here  
And one of us will cry  
  
It's me, it's me  
When you need something more  
Something you're dying for  
It's me, it's me  
When you can't see too clear  
Baby, I'm always near  
It's me  
  
You played your cards, you felt the sorrow  
'Cuz all that dealer dealt was pain  
But baby, where you gonna play tomorrow  
The stakes were too damn high  
And now, you're broke again  
You can trip around til all your money's blown  
But who's the man that'll take you in  
When all your luck is gone  
  
It's me, it's me  
What are you searching for  
I know you can find my door  
It's me, it's me  
I know you've sinned every sin  
But I'll still take you in  
It's me  
  
And me, I'm sitting here  
Nothing much has changed  
You broke my heart to pieces, babe  
But that's nothing strange  
Well, I ain't angry  
That's all come and gone  
My arms are still open wide girl  
To catch you when you fall  
  
And if someday you realize  
Just where you belong  
I'm the man that'll take you in  
When all your luck is gone  
It's me, it's me  
  
When you need something more  
Something you're dying for  
It's me, it's me  
When you can't see too clear  
Baby, I'm always near  
  
It's me, it's me  
What are you searching for  
I know you can find my door  
It's me, it's me  
I know you've sinned every sin  
But I'll still take you in  
It's me  
Yeah, baby, it's me

You can burn my house, You can cut my hair  
You can make me wrestle naked with a grizzly bear  
You can poison my cat, Baby I don't care  
But if you talk in the movies I'll kill you right there  
  
It's the little things  
It's just the little things  
Aw it's the little things  
It's just the little things  
Yeah it's the little things  
That drive me wild  
  
I'm like a mad dog  
I'm on a short leash  
I'm on a tight rope hanging by a thread  
I'm on some thin ice  
You push me too far  
Welcome to my nightmare  
No more Mr. Nice Guy  
  
You can steal my car aAnd drive it into the lake  
You can stick me in the oven and put it on bake  
You could throw a big brick through my window pane  
But if I ever hear you ask me how I got my name  
  
It's the little things  
It's just the little things  
Aw it's the little things

I've got more to lose, more to lose than you  
Cause I'm the only one in love between us too  
I know that I've been struck by lightning from above  
Cause I've been killed by love  
  
I got a longer fall, a longer fall to take  
Cause I'm a bigger fool with a bigger heart to break  
You pushed me way to far, a push became a shove  
And I was killed by love  
  
Drop me off in a crowded lonely city  
Everybody there was crying  
Drop me off in a town without pity  
And let me be the one that's dying  
  
Killed by love  
Killed by love  
Killed by love  
Oh bye bye love  
  
Ha ha ha ha

Baby, baby  
Oh bye bye love

I don't know why my whole world came crashin' down,  
I just woke up in lonely town  
I opened up my eyes and much to my surprise  
Look at this heaven that I've found  
Don't need to care about tomorrow  
I got no pain, I got no sorrow  
  
I'm the last man on earth  
So tell me what it's worth  
Am I a beggar or a king?  
Got no trouble, got no time,  
Eternity is mine  
I got a whole lot of everything  
  
I can take this town  
And just burn it to the ground  
Smash every window that I see  
I can smoke, I can drink,  
I can swear, an' I can stink  
There ain't no one to bother me  
No, no  
  
Don't need to care about tomorrow  
I got not pain, I got no sorrow  
  
I'm the last man on earth,  
So tell me what it's worth  
Am I a beggar or a king?  
Got no trouble, got no time  
Eternity is mine  
I got a whole lot of everything  
It's all mine  
  
There's not a single soul to talk to me,  
But that's okay, I never liked them  
  
I'm the last man on earth  
And I know what it's worth  
I'm not a beggar, I'm a king  
Got no troubles, got no time,  
And everything is fine  
'Cause I'm the king of everything  
It's all mine  
Mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine

Leather boots poundin' the floor  
Black and shiny kickin' the door  
The police, hit the streets  
They would never take the boots off of their feet  
  
If I break the law and get caught  
I could get smashed in the face by the big boys  
'Cause they're frightened by the real world  
Frightened by the real world  
Scared of the real world. Oh yeah  
  
I saw a cop, he looked pretty shot  
By some criminals, left there to rot  
I took a look, no one around  
I put on his boots and stomped on the ground  
  
Stood tall and felt so strong  
I wanted to be just like them  
So I could hurt somebody  
Hurt somebody  
  
Hurt somebody, hurt somebody  
Scared of the real world. Oh yeah  
Scared of the real world. Oh yeah  
  
Don't litter or score in the dark  
Don't kill your lover and don't overpark  
Cause if you murder or if you loot  
Get the heel of my new leather boots  
  
If I break the law and get caught  
You could get smashed in the face  
By this young boy  
Who is frightened by the real world  
This boy is frightened by the real world  
I gonna hurt somebody  
'Cause I'm frightened of the real world. Oh yeah

I got my invitation to the annual levity ball  
Seeing the location is within the mirrored room  
Walking in my room I found I had nothing to find  
I got into my evening wear and left my clothes behind  
I sat down at the stairway seven hours at a time  
Writing all of this poetry that I knew would never rhyme  
The memory I know I must have had when I came in  
Was of some place I'd never ever been  
And then in came a cake all decorated in my name  
With four paper brown candles are all spelling out this name  
The clock was passing out from time to time  
I saw it all at the beginning of the ending of my first levity ball

You walk into the room, everybody stares  
The talking stops, there's a silence there  
The room is yours, you own it now  
You're in control and everybody down here knows  
You got a place in my heart, I don't want you there  
But you come and you go, like a millionaire  
You take a walk right across my soul  
You're in control and everybody down here knows  
  
You're the life and the death of the party  
You got my heart right by the throat  
You're the life and the death of the party  
When the stage lights rise  
You start and stop the show  
  
You love me bad, you love me good  
You're unimpressed, that's understood  
I lost it all, you knew I would  
You're in control and everybody down here knows  
  
You're the life and the death of the party  
You got my heart right by the throat  
You're the life and the death of the party  
When the stage lights rise  
You start and stop the show  
  
It's just one night  
It's just one time  
It's just one hotel room  
It's just another dream  
That can't come true  
  
You're the life and the death of the party  
You got my heart right by the throat  
You're the life and the death of the party  
When the stage lights rise  
You start and stop the show

Black leather gloves and your lipstick shines  
Bright as moonlight glows  
My wildest rose cuts so fine and deep  
It hurts but never shows  
You're bad, you're so hardcore  
Pull me down here on the killing floor  
  
[Chorus:]  
Little by little we cross the line  
Little by little the ties that bind  
Little by little by little by little  
Little by little tonight  
  
Your sugar tongue speaks hot and sweet  
Lying just for fun  
Push and shove  
Sex is sex  
But honey, love is love  
We're not sick insane  
Just another lovers' game  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm all undone  
My pretty one  
Don't slap my face  
Unless you kiss me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You beg and you cry for more  
You pull me down here on the killing floor  
  
[Chorus]

Living  
I is only one part of being  
Believing  
Is to know just what you're feeling  
  
You were so positive thing you know, you have  
I'm sure that in knowing you're growing and it's you  
  
Thinking  
Is you're own road of living  
Dreaming  
Is the one way to being  
  
Go in and your eye can see everything that's you  
The only real person you need to know is you  
  
Ah, oh  
Living, Living, Living

Alice Cooper  
You have been accused of mass mental cruelty  
How do you plead?  
Guilty!  
  
Don't want to be clean  
Don't want to be nice  
The whip's gonna crack  
My leather is black and so are my eyes  
I'm gonna be rough  
I'm gonna be mean  
I'm here 'til the end, my sick little friend  
I'm back in your dreams  
You can take my head and cut it off  
But you ain't gonna change my mind  
  
If you don't like it you can lock me up  
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh  
If you don't like it you can lock me up  
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
Cover your eyes or cover your head  
You'll never know what hit you til you're covered in red  
Screaming bloody murder 'til the barricades bend  
Sweatin' in the fog til the end  
  
It's gotta be loud  
I want it to roar  
I want it to blow everyone at the show off of the floor  
I'm in for the kill  
I'm back with a rage  
I want them to write in the paper each night how I bloodied the stage  
  
Oh, If you don't like it you can lock me up  
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh  
If you don't like it you can lock me up  
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, lock me up or shut up  
No no no no, no...  
  
Cover your eyes or cover your head  
You'll never know what hit you 'til you're covered in red  
Screaming bloody murder 'til the barricades bend  
Sweatin' in the lights 'til the end  
  
If you don't like it you can lock me up  
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh - I want to be hot  
If you don't like it you can lock me up  
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh - I want to be cool  
If you don't like it you can lock me up  
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh - I want to be sick  
If you don't like it you can lock me up  
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh - ah, real sick

We still got a long way to go  
We still got a long way to go  
We all got a long way to go  
  
What's keeping us apart isn't selfishness  
What's holding us together isn't love  
Listen to the man who's been  
touched all his life  
Yes he's the one they call the fool  
  
Where is the saviour of the sidewalk life  
and the road that takes us to the crusades  
I've seen those shadows  
as they're moving in my sleep  
leading the blind poet to his grave  
  
We still got a long way to go  
We still got a long way to go  
Yes we all got a long way to go  
  
Please don't waste your energy on me my friend  
cause we still got a long way to go  
we'll meet again some day  
but right now just go away  
'cause I still got a long way to go  
  
The silence is speaking  
so why am I weeping  
I guess I love it  
I love it to death  
  
Yes we still got a long way to go  
Yes we still got a long way to go  
Yes we all got a long way to go

You got your crust  
Turning my daydreams into dust  
  
Oh look at you over there  
Ripping the sawdust from my teddybear  
Yeah look at you over there  
Ripping the sawdust from my teddybear  
  
You're so darn pretty girl  
Well I think you know it you was you  
On Monday morning putting back yakity yak  
  
Oh look at you over there  
Ripping the sawdust from my teddybear  
Yeah now look at you over there  
Ripping the sawdust from my teddybear  
  
You take the pebbles from the babies rattle  
You make Santa's raindeer look like cattle  
You take Tinkerbells rust  
And turn it into sawdust  
  
Yeah now look at you over there  
Ripping the sawdust from my teddybear  
Yeah look at you over there  
Ripping the sawdust from my teddybear  
  
You take the pebbles from the babies rattle  
You make Santa's raindeer look like cattle  
You take Tinkerbells rust  
And turn it into sawdust  
  
You got your crust  
Turning my daydreams into dust  
  
Yeah now look at you over there  
Ripping the sawdust from my teddybear  
Yeah now look at you over there  
Ripping the sawdust from my teddybear  
Look at you over there

Yeah look at you over there

Look at you over there  
Look at you over there  
Look at you over there  
Over there, over there, over there, over there  
My poor teddybear, teddybear, teddybear, teddybear

I can't get a girl  
'Cause I ain't got a car  
I can't get a car  
'Cause I ain't got a job  
I can't get a job  
'Cause I ain't got a car  
So I'm looking for a girl with a job and a car  
Don't you know where you are  
  
Lost in America  
  
I got a mom but I ain't got a dad  
My dad's got a wife but she ain't my mom  
Mom's looking for a man to be my dad  
But I want my mom and dad to be my real  
mom and dad  
Is that so bad  
Oh, I think I've been had  
  
Lost in America  
  
Well, I live at the 7-11  
Well, I'm tryin' to play this guitar  
Well, I'm learning "Stairway to Heaven"  
'cause Heaven's where you are  
  
I can't go to school  
'Cause I ain't got a gun  
I ain't got a gun  
'Cause I ain't got a job  
I ain't got a job  
'Cause I can't go to school  
So I'm looking for a girl with a gun and a job  
Don't you know where you are  
  
Lost in America

Somebody told me love's a beautiful thing  
And when I found it all the bells would just ring  
The sun would shine and all the birds would sing  
Then I met you  
  
I searched the planet for that magical girl  
I walked a million miles all over the world  
I found the oysters, but never the pearls.  
Then I met you...  
  
I can't eat  
I can't sleep  
I feel sick  
I'm so weak  
  
Love should never feel like this  
I must be doing something wrong  
I've never felt this way before  
  
Walk in the bathroom and I take a deep breath  
Look in the mirror and it scares me to death  
Look like a junkie that's been strung out on meth  
Since I met you  
  
I can't eat  
I can't sleep  
I feel sick  
I'm so weak  
  
Love should never feel like this  
I must be doing something wrong  
I've never felt this way before  
  
Love should never feel like this  
I must be doing something wrong  
I never felt this way before  
  
Oh, ignorance was always bliss  
Love should never feel like this  
  
Love should never, ever feel like this  
I've never felt this way before  
I must be doing something wrong  
No, Love should never, ever feel like this  
I must be doing something wrong  
I've never, ever felt this way before  
What's wrong with me!  
  

I slipped into my jeans  
Lookin' hard and feelin' mean  
I took a spit at the moon  
It's all in this luney tune  
Just a little insane  
A couple shots, I can't feel no pain  
Hey, where have I been?  
And who are these scary men?  
  
Is this all real?  
Is this all necessary?  
Or it this a joke?  
  
Many know, I don't regret at all  
They locked me up for good  
Pinned me against the wall  
  
I can't find the exit  
I quit looking for doors  
I stole a razor from the commissary  
I just couldn't take it no more  
  
I'm swimmin' in blood  
Like a rat on a sewer floor  
No longer insane  
Just part of this crazy dream

When I was a boy  
I never played with toys  
Never had a friend  
Never laughed or cried much  
And when I was a boy  
My father was a man  
With a strict and sturdy hand  
No soft touch  
  
Make that money, make that money  
Make that money run like honey  
On your tongue  
Gotta make that money  
Make that money, listen sonny  
Learn to sting before your stung  
  
Now that I'm a man  
Every penny has been planned  
I'm financially grand  
And perfectly greedy  
Sentimental fools  
I make all your rules  
I've got your cash, got your jewels  
They're all mortgaged to me  
  
Make that money, make that money  
Make that money run like honey  
On your tongue  
Gotta make that money  
Make that money, listen sonny  
Learn to sting before your stung  
  
And I know  
'Cause he told me so  
Told me so I believe him  
I still believe...  
Give me that money  
  
Controlling all your cash  
I could make you live in trash  
I eat pheasant, you eat hash  
No philanthropy  
But when it's time for me to croak  
Bury me with all my dough  
And where there should've been an oak  
My private money tree will grow  
  
Make that money  
Said make that money  
Make that money run like honey  
On your tongue  
  
Told me so  
Told me so  
He told me so

I wake up every morning, Six o'clock, I'm right on time  
I eat a low fat breakfast, I tie a perfect tie  
I kiss the wife, I hug the kids, I pat the dogs and cats  
I never lose anything, my car keys or my hat  
  
'Cause I'm the man of the year  
I'm the man of the year  
  
I never cheat at finals, or miss a day at school  
My urine tests are perfect, my prostate is a jewel  
  
'Cause I'm the man of the year  
I'm the man of the year  
'Cause I'm the man of the year  
I'm never, ever jealous  
Never, ever cruel  
I'm a graduate of Harvard  
Where I never broke the rules  
  
The queen made me a knight  
The pope made me a saint  
The president plays golf with me  
I make Madonna faint  
  
So why am I so lonely  
Depressed and in despair  
If I pull this trigger in my mouth will anybody care  
  
It was the greatest funeral, I laid in perfect state  
And later I will meet the lord, I bet he just can't wait  
  
To meet the man of the year  
I'm the man of the year  
Stand in line to meet the man  
I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man  

The man  
With the golden gun  
Is waiting  
Somewhere  
Out there  
For you  
  
But you'll never see him  
He'll be looking for you  
  
Demand  
For the golden gun  
It's high priced  
Precise  
And true  
  
But you'll never see him  
He'll be looking for you  
  
The man with the golden  
Gun in his pocket, oh, oh  
The man with the golden  
Gun in his case, oh, oh  
The man with the golden  
Gun in your face  
  
But you'll never see him  
He'll be looking for you  
You better believe  
He'll be looking for you  
  
He-e-e-e-e-e's  
The man with the golden  
Gun in his pocket  
The man with the golden  
Gun in his case  
The man with the golden  
Gun in his pocket  
The man with the golden  
Gun in your face  
  
But you'll never see him  
He'll be looking for you  
You better believe  
He'll be looking for yo-ou  
  
He-e-e-e-e-e's  
The man with the golden  
Gun in his pocket  
The man with the golden  
Gun in his case  
The man with the golden  
Gun in his pocket  
The man with the golden  
Gun in your face  
  
The man with the go-o-olden  
Gun in his pocket  
The man with the go-o-lden  
Gun in his case  
The man who gave you the golden gun

The city streets are wet with rain tonight  
Taxi drivers swerve from lane to lane  
A lonely guitar man playin' down the hall  
Midnight blues comin' through the walls  
  
I tried to call you on the telephone  
I left it off the hook  
Just to hear it ring  
You told me you were better off alone  
I never knew that tears could stain  
  
I'm on the roof and I'm starin' at the stars  
Lookin' down at all the cars  
I can see you  
In the window of your favorite corner bar  
But to reach you is just too far  
And I might as well be on mars  
  
The city seems so old and grey and beat  
It closes in and makes me want to suffocate  
And you just live across the street  
But that's a billion miles away  
  
You've turned my world into a dark and lonely place  
Like a planet lost in space, my light is fadin'  
I'd cross the universe to be right where you are  
But I'm right in your backyard  
And I might as well be on mars  
  
Chorus  
I might as well be on mars  
You can't see me  
I might as well be the man on the moon  
You can't hear me  
Oh, can you feel me so close  
And yet so far  
Baby, I might as well be on mars  
  
Baby, I can't fly  
If I could I'd come down to ya  
Maybe I should try  
  
I'm on the roof and I'm starin' at the stars  
Lookin' down at all lthe cars  
I can see you  
In the window of your favorite corner bar  
But to reach is just too far  
And I might as well be on mars  
  
Chorus

Be an Arab, Be a Jew  
Be a boxing kangaroo  
Beat yourself all black and blue  
I don't care  
  
Be a bleeder, Be a Cancer  
A hemophiliac romancer  
Be a crippled disco dancer  
Oooh... What a pair  
  
[Chorus]  
He's a model citizen  
I think I've got them fooled them again?  
He's an ultra-sweety guy  
And a master of disguise?  
He's a model citizen  
Just keep believing that my friends  
I'm a model citizen?  
  
[Bridge]  
I'm a model citizen  
I'm a model citizen  
I'm a model citizen  
I'm an all American  
  
I'm a hostage in a city of creeps  
They've got mercenary guards  
That watch me sleep  
They'd like to kill me slow  
Bury me deep  
  
In the heart of Texas  
I'm a martyr, I'm a sadist  
I might be the Savior here to save us  
I'm a friend of Sammy Davis, casually  
  
[Chorus]  
He's a model citizen  
I think I've got them fooled again?  
He's an ultra-sweety guy  
I won't let down my disguise?  
He's a model citizen  
Just keep believing that my friends  
I'm a model citizen?  
  
[Bridgex2]  
I'm a model citizen  
I'm a model citizen  
I'm a model citizen  
I'm an all American

Mr and Misdemeanor  
Middle of the roaders  
Set beside the ocean  
Landscapes alive agoshin'  
Who put all of this in motion  
  
Lucky Luciano  
Kenneth Pasarelli  
You take the modern mosquito  
To every big city  
I sit beside Misdemeanor  
Here's new pretties for you  
  
Nobody likes me, but we adore you  
Da da d-da da, yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
(Cheers)  
  
Nasty Misdemeanor  
Kickin' in the windows  
Parked beside the ocean  
Landscapes alive agoshin'  
Who put all of this in motion  
Da da d-da da, yeah yeah yeah yeah

Aw, who's the queen of the locker room  
Who's the cream of the crop  
Poor Joey took her to the matinee  
Said, "God, she wouldn't stop!"  
  
Holy muscle of love  
My heart's a muscle  
  
Well, I must have come to that crazy age  
Where ev'rything is hot  
'Cause I don't know if the things I'm thinking  
Are normal thoughts or not  
  
Holy muscle of love  
Well, I got a muscle of love  
Yeah  
Ooh  
  
I read Dad's books like I did before  
Now things are crystal clear  
Lock the door in the bathroom now  
I just can't get caught in here  
  
Holy muscle of love  
Well, I got a muscle of love  
Holy muscle of love  
I got a muscle of love  
Holy muscle of love  
My heart's a muscle of love  
Holy muscle of love  
Well, I got a muscle of love  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Must be a gift from above  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
(Hallelujah, etc.)

If I should find myself in blackest night,  
And fear is stabbin' me all over,  
A tiny prayer cracks the dark with light,  
And I here sounds behind my wall.  
Inside, a still small voice, it calls and calls.  
Then like a thunder bolt it falls and falls:  
My God!  
  
When life becomes more real than children's games,  
Or we've become too old to play them,  
We'll grow old gracefully,  
We'll hide our shame.  
But there's that voice behind the wall.  
And like my conscience, it is still and small.  
Each word is mercy, protects us all:  
My God!  
  
"Et in lux perpetuo"  
"Deu domine"  
"Et in pax aeternus"  
"Deu domine"  
  
I was a boy, when tempted, fell sometimes,  
And fell so low, no one could see me,  
Save for the eyes of Him that sees my crime.  
When sheep, like me, have drifted lost,  
All frightened children who are tempest tossed,  
Down flies His wrath like an albatross:  
My God!

My stars  
So far  
No one's callin' me home  
Space brain  
Vagabond  
Living on my own  
  
Come on you faithful  
You know all you people should come to me  
I'll make you arms work  
And I'll make your legs work  
I'll make you see  
Ladada dadada dadada dadada da da  
Whoa, yeah  
  
Well I swear by the air  
I'll be made to breathe  
You'll pay very dear for this banishing deed  
The power alone stored in my little hand  
Could melt the Eiffel Tower  
Turn the Sphinx into sand  
  
Oh no  
Thar she blows  
Spreadin' crazy news  
All night  
Cannonball  
Loves to light the fuse  
  
And everyone blows up  
And nobody grows up to fill Dad's shoes  
But that doesn't matter  
'cause no little boys really wanted to  
  
Ladada dadada dadada dadada da da  
Whoa, yeah  
  
I stared at the squall line  
I stared at the fault line  
I see a funnel black there  
I think I see a crack there  
Landscapes alive  
And it's moving my feet  
All I need's a Holocaust  
To make my day complete

You ask me, baby  
Can you work tonight  
I've been up, babe  
Since broad daylight  
  
I just can't believe  
That you're sellin' me  
You never sold me before  
I just can't recall  
You're like a whore  
  
Oh yeah, I'm bad tonight  
You really like my style  
If you want me  
Can't even buy my smile  
  
Now I find come around  
Just to lay this money on you, babe  
I'm sick of tradin' tricks and dicks  
And I'm, I'm really sick of you  
Oh I -  
  
Never been sold before  
And I'll never be hurt again  
No, I never been sold before  
And I'll never be hurt again  
  
I just can't believe  
That you're sellin' me  
You never sold me before  
I just can't recall  
You little whore, no no no no no  
  
Never been sold before  
And I'll never be hurt again  
No, I never been sold before  
And I'll never be hurt again  
  
Never been sold before  
And I'll never be hurt again  
No, I never been sold before  
And I'll never be hurt again

We've been so caught up in the subject of personnel  
Playing and acting, and slaving and bathing ourselves  
  
Who lies and who tries to come over everyone  
Painting a picture to show everyone in the world  
  
Fearing is natural  
New names and faces can bring  
Build ups and barriers hiding behind everything  
  
Who lies and who tries to come over everyone  
Painting a picture to show everyone in the world.

I got a job in Atlanta in a mall playing Santa  
Not because of any talent but because I was the  
only one the suit would fit  
Everybody shopping, little sticky kids were hopping  
on my lap with their fingers in my beard  
I guess they thought that I was really it  
  
She sat down on my lap and said to me  
"I'm twenty three and I need someone  
You look like someone who could play with me  
Stay with me, all day with me"  
  
Cause I'm in no man's land  
Can't seem to find a real man  
You know I'm lookin' for a steel man  
She said I'm in no man's land  
I'm gonna show you a real good time  
I'd gladly pay you double overtime  
  
She was beggin' to be mine, but my job was on the line  
Should I say or should I go? I just didn't know... Hmmmm  
  
I left fifty kids standin' in line, they were whining, they were crying  
and their mothers they were screaming in hysterics and I swear  
I never heard such profanity  
  
I dropped my suit on the floor  
they were trying to block the door  
They were calling her a whore  
They were driven to nativities insanity  
We drove away in her Mercedes Benz, dirty blond split ends in the breeze  
She said "I want to put you under my tree  
You're just a little gift from me to me"  
  
Cause I'm in no man's land  
Can't seem to find a real man  
You know I'm lookin' for a steel man  
She said I'm in no man's land  
You know I'm ready for a real good time  
I'd gladly pay you double overtime  
  
She had money all her life  
She wasn't lookin' to become my wife  
She said, "I hope you understand  
I just want a nightful of man, Sonny"  
  
She didn't notice I was thin with a delicate chin  
Nor the softness of my skin, nor the scent of my other personalities  
She didn't see through my disguise - didn't see it in my eyes  
She was in for a surprise when she discovered my emotional plurality  
  
She said "Come and lay down on the floor with me  
It's warmer here by the fire"  
She didn't know that there was more of me  
She'd have to learn to love all four of me  
  
Cause I'm in no man's land  
I'm lookin' for the real me, If only I could feel me  
You know I'm in no man's land  
Sometimes I gotta play me, It's really hard to stay me  
Hey, I'm in no mans land  
I'm looking for the real me, If only I could feel me  
You know I'm in no man's land  
Sometimes I gotta play me, It's really hard to stay me  
Oh, I'm in no man's land  
I'm looking for the real me, If only I could feel me

I used to be such a sweet, sweet thing  
'Til they got a hold of me.  
I opened doors for little old ladies,  
I helped the blind to see.  
I got no friends 'cause they read the papers.  
They can't be seen with me and I'm gettin' real shot down  
And I'm feeling mean.  
  
[Chorus]  
No more Mister Nice Guy,  
No more Mister Clean,  
No more Mister Nice Guy,  
They say he's sick, he's obscene.  
  
I got no friends 'cause they read the papers.  
They can't be seen with me and I'm feelin' real shot down  
And I'm gettin' mean.  
  
No more Mister Nice Guy,  
No more Mister Clean,  
No more Mister Nice Guy,  
They say he's sick, he's obscene.  
  
My dog bit me on the leg today.  
My cat clawed my eyes.  
Ma's been thrown out of the social circle,  
And dad has to hide.  
I went to church incognito.  
When everybody rose, the Reverend Smith,  
He recognized me,  
And punched me in the nose, he said.  
  
No more Mister Nice Guy,  
No more Mister Clean,  
No more Mister Nice Guy,  
He said you're sick, you're obscene.  
  
No more Mister Nice Guy,  
No more Mister Clean,  
No more Mister Nice Guy,  
He said you're sick, you're obscene.

No time for tears  
Stars don't have time to cry  
No time for tears  
He's just another guy  
Who used your heart  
But don' forget who you are  
  
You're playing the part  
The greatest movie star  
So soul aches  
You think it's  
The end of it all  
  
But tears always dry  
And all of us lie  
That's all  
Yeah tears always dry  
And all of us lie  
That's all  
  
Your soul aches  
You cry out  
You're weeping  
You're while  
  
But tears always dry  
And all of us lie  
Sometimes  
Yeah tears always dry  
And all of us lie  
Sometimes  
But tears always dry  
And all of us lie  
Sometimes?  
Yeah tears always dry  
All of us lie  
Sometimes?  
Only sometimes

No tricks  
Up my sleeve  
I kicked the downs  
And now I'm clean  
No shakes  
Up my spine  
I beat the speed and I  
Dumped the wine  
No tracks  
That was yesterday  
I changed my style  
The way I play  
(Don't you believe it)  
No blues  
No depression  
No more panic  
Or obsession  
Don't you believe  
Anything he said  
All them junkies talk that way  
It's just as bad as it was before  
I see the man knockin' at his back door  
... this kid's straight  
And put on ice  
The street corner deals at any price  
Come on and check my veins  
And check my eyes  
No tracks  
That was yesterday  
I changed my style  
The way I play  
(Don't you believe it)  
No blues  
No depression  
No more panic  
Or obsession  
Some tricks  
Just go away  
And other tricks  
They're here to stay  
(Oh don't you know me)  
Sometimes my spirit's willin'  
The flesh is weak and  
That's what's killin'  
Don't you believe  
Anything he said  
All them junkies talk that way  
It's just as bad as it was before  
I see the man knockin' at his back door  
Hey now this kid's straight  
Put on ice  
The street corner deals at any price  
Come on and check my veins  
And check my eyes  
I tried so hard  
But I'm hurting for another fix  
It's just this habit  
I, I can always kick  
What do you say there friend?  
(Don't you call me..)  
It's just a game  
And I can beat it any day  
No matter what this lovely lady say  
Hey, want to be my friend?  
Some tricks  
They go away  
And other tricks  
They're here to stay  
(Oh don't you know me)  
Sometimes my spirit's willin'  
My flesh is weak and  
That's what's killin'  
Don't you believe  
Anything he said  
All them junkies talk that way  
It's just as bad as it was before  
I see the man knockin' at his back door  
I said this kid's straight  
And put on ice  
The street corner deals at any price  
Come on and check my veins  
And check my eyes

Nobody likes me

Nobody likes me

All the hate has built up

We like your dog Spot  
Even Spot?

Hello, my little pretty  
My, don't we look YUCK  
Come here!  
  
You spend all day picking out your dress  
I like you dirty, when you're hair is a mess  
You smell so sweet walking in the room yeah  
You don't have to try so hard to drown me in perfume  
  
Don't cry your heart out  
Don't tell your preacher  
Don't get ideas, this won't last forever  
Just want to touch you  
Just want to feel you  
Just want to taste you  
I never wanted, I never wanted love before  
I never wanted, I never wanted love before  
  
Not that kind of love

No, not that kind of love  
It's not that kind of love  
No, it's not that kind of love  
  
Yeah...

If you want to go, some cheap motel  
You can pick me up at eight, I'll never tell  
  
Don't cry your heart out  
Don't tell your preacher  
Don't get ideas, this won't last forever  
Just want to touch you

Don't gimme that kind of love  
(fade)

You, me  
Understand  
Shake my hand  
Last chance, little man  
Ain't it grand  
It's a bargain, it's a steal  
30 pieces of silver  
And a deal's a deal  
  
Sign upon the dotted line  
I'll be yours and you'll be mine  
Nothing's free  
Eventually  
Nothing's free  
  
From the rules and laws of morality  
Free to take your fill  
Free from your own free will  
Nothing's free  
  
My boy, it's getting late  
I'll raise the stakes  
So close  
Control your fate, why hesitate  
Seal the deal, close the sale  
Take my hammer, drive the nail  
  
Sign upon the bloody line  
A drop of yours, a drop of mine  
Nothing's free  
Eternally  
Nothing's free  
  
From your conscience or  
Free from the consequence  
Free to sin and death  
Free till your final breath  
Nothing's free  
Free from the claws and flaws of your family  
Free from obedient life  
You're cut like a double-edged knife  
Nothing's free, nothing's free  
Oh, you pay me  
  
Free to ignore the bore of authority  
Free to spit in the face  
Be the winningest rat in the race till Judgement Day  
Then nothing's free  
Bow to me if you want to be free  
Free from life, come die with me  
And when we're dead it's for eternity  
  
Come on little one and dance in the fire  
The heat's getting close  
and the flame's getting higher  
When the music's over there's a hush in the choir  
Nothing's free  
When the trumpets sound  
and his light is all around  
And the saints all raise from the graves  
in the ground  
We'll be going way downtown  
Way downtown

When I was 10, fell out of bed  
Got three stitches in my head  
It hurt like hell  
I saw the blood, I felt the pain  
I'd like to feel it once again  
'Cause I don't feel it  
  
Then I got stung, right on the face  
I screamed and ran around the place  
It hurt like hell  
I swoll right up, I burned for days  
I'd like to feel it once again  
  
Cause when you touch me  
When you hold me  
When you kiss me  
I don't feel anything  
When you touch me  
When you hold me  
When you kiss me  
It's just like Novocaine  
  
I remember every cut and scrape  
I've been numb so long  
Something's wrong  
So I'll take anything  
  
I slap my face, I pull my hair  
Just to see if something's there  
It should hurt like hell  
I miss the pinch, I miss the pain  
That shock sensation in my brain  
  
Cause when you touch me  
When you hold me  
When you kiss me  
I don't feel anything  
When you touch me  
When you hold me  
When you kiss me  
I don't feel anything  
  
When you touch me (when you touch me)  
When you hold me (when you hold me)  
When you kiss me  
I don't feel it  
When you touch me (when you touch me)  
When you hold me (when you hold me)  
When you kiss me  
It's just like Novocaine  
I don't feel anything  
I don't feel it  
I don't feel it  
I don't feel it  
Well, I don't feel it  
No, I don't feel it  
I don't feel it  

Anybody's dream can fall apart  
Anybody's mask can break  
Couldn't tell you how I wanted you  
Enough to make you want to stay  
I never said the words out loud  
I guess I couldn't get 'em straight  
Baby, give me one more chance  
Before you walk away  
  
It's only, only, only, only my heart talkin'  
Yeah, it's only, only, only, only my heart talkin'  
Sayin' things I never thought I'd say  
Can't you hear me knocking  
I tried to fool you but it wouldn't play  
'Cause my heart it's talkin', it's talkin'  
Oh baby, it's talkin'  
Talkin' to you  
  
Everytime I take it to the edge  
Everytime I'm so afraid  
Don't you know I cry my eyes out, babe  
Everytime you look away  
Oh, I almost dropped a tear  
But I caught it just in time  
I'd say those things you want to hear  
If you'd help me, help me, help me try  
  
It's only, only, only, only my heart talkin'  
Yeah, it's only, only, only, only my heart talkin'  
Sayin' things I never thought I'd say  
Can't you hear me knocking  
Tried to fool you but it wouldn't play  
'Cause my heart it's talkin', it's talkin'  
Baby, it's talkin'  
Talkin' to you  
  
Well, I don't want to hide away  
Hide away without you, baby  
Don't you go and run away  
Come and help me, baby  
Just a little help, baby  
Oh, my little baby  
  
It's only, only, only, only my heart talkin'  
Yeah, it's only, only, only, only my heart talkin'  
Sayin' things I never thought I'd say  
Can't you hear me knocking  
I tried to fool you but it wouldn't play  
'Cause my heart it's talkin', it's talkin'  
Baby, it's talkin'  
Talkin' to you  
  
It's only, only, only, only my heart talkin'  
Yeah, it's only, only, only, only my heart talkin'  
Yeah it's only only only only only, only only only  
My heart talkin'  
Talkin' to you  
It's my heart that does the talkin'  
talkin' to you  
ah... talkin' to you

Man's got his woman to take his seed  
He's got the power - oh  
She's got the need  
She spends her life through pleasing up her man  
She feeds him dinner or anything she can  
  
She cries alone at night too often  
He smokes and drinks and don't come home at all  
Only women bleed  
Only women bleed  
Only women bleed  
  
Man makes your hair gray  
He's your life's mistake  
All you're really lookin' for is an even break  
  
He lies right at you  
You know you hate this game  
He slaps you once in a while and you live and love in pain  
  
She cries alone at night too often  
He smokes and drinks and don't come home at all  
Only women bleed  
Only women bleed  
Only women bleed  
Only women bleed  
Only women bleed  
Only women bleed  
Only women bleed  
  
Black eyes all of the time  
Don't spend a dime  
Clean up this grime  
And you there down on your knees begging me please come  
Watch me bleed  
  
Only women bleed  
Only women bleed  
Only women bleed  
Only women bleed  
Only women bleed  
Only women bleed  
Only women bleed  

I'm hidden in the scream  
When the virgin dies  
I'm the ache in the belly  
When your baby cries  
And I'm the burnin' sensation  
When the convict fries  
  
I'm pain  
I'm your pain  
Unspeakable pain  
I'm your private pain  
  
And I'm the compound fracture  
In the twisted car  
And I'm the lines on the face  
Of the tramp at the bar  
And I'm the reds by the bed  
Of the suicide star  
  
You know me- I'm pain  
I'm your pain  
Your own private pain  
Unfathomable pain  
  
And it's a compliment to me  
To hear you screamin' through the night  
All night  
Tonight  
  
I'm the holes in your arm  
When you're feeling the shakes  
I'm the lump on your head  
When you step on the rake  
  
And I'm the loudest one laughing  
At the saddest wake  
  
Yes I'm pain  
I'm just pain  
Dear old pain  
You need your pain  
  
And I'm the loudest one laughing  
At the saddest wake  
  
I'm the salt in the sweat  
On the cuts of the slaves  
I was the wound in the side  
While Jesus prayed  
I was the filthiest word  
At the vandalized grave  
  
Yes, pain  
Do you love me pain  
I love my pain  
I'm your pain  
  
It's a compliment to me  
To hear you screamin' through the night  
All night  
Tonight

We've been so caught up in the subject of personnel  
Playing and acting, and slaving and bathing ourselves  
  
Who lies and who tries to come over everyone  
Painting a picture to show everyone in the world  
  
Fearing is natural  
New names and faces can bring  
Build ups and barriers hiding behind everything  
  
Who lies and who tries to come over everyone  
Painting a picture to show everyone in the world

Sonny wakes up in the morning feeling kinda sick  
Needs a little Stoli Vodka, needs it really quick  
Sees a little blood run from his eyes  
Feels a little hotel paralyzed  
  
Pass the gun around  
Give everyone a shot...give everyone a shot, you gotta  
Pass the gun around  
And throw me in the local river, let me float away  
  
I wake up watching cartoons...the television's on  
There's a couple of party balloons and all my money's gone  
She was just a reason to unwind  
And actually the last thing I could find  
  
Why don't you, pass the gun around  
Give everyone a shot...give everyone a shot, you better  
Pass the gun around  
And dump me in the local river, let me float away  
float away, ah float away  
  
Pass the gun around  
Give everyone a shot...give everyone a shot, why don't you  
Pass the gun around  
Throw me in the local river, let me float away  
  
Sonny wakes up in the morning, there's a stranger in his bed  
Someone's pounding on the hotel door, he wishes he was dead  
I've had so many blackout nights before  
I don't think I can take this anymore  
  
Why don't you, pass the gun around  
Give everyone a shot...give everyone a shot, why don't you  
Pass the gun around  
Give everyone a shot...give everyone a shot, we're gonna  
Pass the gun around  
  
Give everyone a shot...give everyone a shot, we're gonna  
Pass the gun around  
Give everyone a shot...give everyone a shot, you gotta  
Pass the gun around  
Give everyone a shot...give everyone a shot, you gotta  
Pass the gun around  
Give everyone a shot...give everyone a shot, you gotta  
Pass the gun around  
  
Da Da

She's an overnight sensation  
In the mirror on her wall  
She gets a standing ovation  
At every shower curtain call  
  
And she becomes a pop star  
In the safety of her car  
And then she falls to pieces  
At the karaoke bar  
  
And she's perfect  
Until the lights go on  
And then it all goes wrong  
Cause now she's not so perfect  
  
She can shake it just like J-Lo  
When the bedroom lights go down  
But when she hits the dance floor  
She's a hip-hop hippo clown  
  
She's perfect  
Until the lights go on  
And then it all goes wrong  
Cause now she's not so perfect  
  
She's perfect  
She's so fine  
She's so wonderful  
In the arena of her mind  
  
She's not perfect  
She's all mine  
She can't sing or dance  
She ain't got a chance  
But baby, I don't mind  
  
She's perfect  
Oh, she's perfect  
Ah, she's so perfect  
You know, she's so perfect  
Ah, ah, ah  
  
Sing baby  
Dance, dance, dance  
You got it  
Shake it down  
Oh, that's bad  
That's bad  
I love you baby  
That's just awful  
You got it  
You got it

Don't need a crystal ball for me to see clearly  
No astrology or Tarot cards  
Watching CNN and holding my breath  
To face the daily news scares me to death  
  
I'm pessi-mystic  
I'm so fatalistic  
I'm pessi-mystic  
I don't believe a thing  
I'm pessi-mystic  
I'm so nihlistic  
I'm pessi-mystic  
For what tomorrow brings  
  
I can't hear a word you say  
So shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up  
I like being sick this way  
So shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up  
  
Everybody's mind is badly infected  
Everybody feeds the parasite  
Everything is dark so why not accept it?  
Everything is far more black than white  
  
I'm pessi-mystic  
I'm so fatalistic  
I'm pessi-mystic  
I don't believe a thing  
I'm pessi-mystic  
I'm so pissed-off-istic  
I'm pessi-mystic  
Of what tomorrow brings  
  
I can't hear a word you say  
So shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up  
I like feeling sick this way  
So shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up  
  
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up  
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up  
  
I'm pessi-mystic  
I'm so fatalistic  
I'm pessi-mystic  
I don't believe a thing  
I'm pessi-mystic  
I'm so nihlistic  
I'm pessi-mystic  
Of what tomorrow brings  
  
I can't hear a word you say  
So shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up  
I like being sick this way  
So shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up  
I can't hear a word you say  
So shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up  
I like feeing sick this way  
So shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up  
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up

Collecting pieces of my family in an old pillow case  
This one has a skull but it don't have a face  
These look like the arms of father so strong  
And the ring on this finger means my Grandma is gone  
  
Here's some legs in a cloud where my sister once played  
Here's some mud made of blood and these teeth are decayed  
The ear of my brother, The hand of a friend  
And I just can't put them back together again  
  
Pick up the bones and set them on fire  
Follow the smoke going higher and higher  
Pick up the bones and wish them goodnight  
Pray 'em a prayer and turn out the light  
  
There are stains on the floor where kitchen once stood  
There are ribs on the fire place mixed with the wood  
There are forces in the air, ghosts in the wind  
Some bullets in the back and some scars on the skin  
  
There were demons with guns who marched through this place  
Killing everything that breathed, they're an inhuman race  
There are holes in the walls, bloody hair on the bricks  
And the smell of this hell is making me sick  
  
Pick up the bones and set them on fire  
Follow the smoke going higher and higher  
Pick up the bones and wish them goodnight  
Pray 'em a prayer and turn out the light  
  
Pick up the bones and set them on fire  
Follow the scope going higher and higher  
Pick up the bones and wish them goodnight  
Pray 'em a prayer and turn out the light  
  
Now maybe someday the suns gonna shine  
Flowers will bloom and all will be fine  
But nothing'll grow on this burnt cursed ground  
'Cause the breathe of the death is the only sound

I'm six foot three with a fist like a hammer  
And I work with the Vice Squad when I can  
And when I pull out my badge they forget all my glamor  
Little guys all surprised, take a seat  
Peek at me, it's a bust, I'm a man  
I'm the prettiest cop on the block  
I set your souls on fire  
Yes, I'm the prettiest cop on the block  
I'm cool and I'm so mean  
Oh, I'm the prettiest cop on the block  
I've handcuffed your desire  
I've got a stiff reputation with a stick like a rock  
My kids are confused and my wife is in shock  
I'm a full blooded man not a weak imitation  
I like to flex my arms in the neon lights  
I'm a queen on the street and a king at the station  
It's a secret of mine, not a sign I'm gonna make that right  
Because I'm the prettiest cop on the block  
I set your souls on fire  
Yes, I'm the prettiest cop on the block  
I'm cool and I'm so mean  
I'm the prettiest cop on the block  
I've handcuffed your desire  
I've got a stiff reputation with a stick like a rock  
My kids are confused and my wife is in shock  
I must look pretty shocking  
In my bullet proof vest  
With my black lace stockings  
All this hair on my chest  
When the boys see me coming  
All the boys start to run  
They all got their empty holsters  
And I got the only gun  
Because I'm the prettiest cop on the block  
I set your souls on fire  
Yes, I'm the prettiest cop on the block  
Cool and I'm so mean  
Yes, I'm the prettiest cop on the block  
I handcuff your desires  
I got a stiff reputation with a stick like a rock  
My kids are confused and my wife is in shock  
I'm the prettiest cop on the block  
I set your souls on fire  
Yes, I'm the prettiest cop on the block  
And I'm cool, so mean  
I'm the prettiest cop on the block  
I handcuff your desires  
I'm so pretty, I'm so pretty, so pretty  
Yes, I'm gorgeous  
I'm really lovely  
And I'm so mean, so mean  
I'm ooh, I'm mean  
But I'm pretty and I'm mean  
So pretty but I'm mean  
And I'm pretty  

I had a date with a pretty ballerina  
Her hair so brilliant that it hurt my eyes  
I asked her for this dance  
And then she obliged me  
Was I surprised, yeah  
Was I surprised,  
No not at all  
  
I called her yesterday,  
It should have been tomorrow  
I couldn't keep  
The joy that was inside  
I begged for her to tell me  
If she really loved me  
Somewhere a mountain is moving  
Afraid it's moving  
Without me  
  
I had a date with a pretty ballerina  
Her hair so brilliant that it hurt my eyes  
I asked her for this dance  
And then she obliged me  
Was I surprised, yeah  
Was I surprised, no not at all  
  
And when I wake on a dreary Sunday morning  
I open up my eyes to find there's rain  
And something strange within said,  
Go ahead and find her  
Just close your eyes, yeah  
Just close your eyes and she'll be there  
She'll be there

An angel fell one stormy night  
From heaven's glory  
He split the earth to reign in hell  
Waoh o-oh  
He fears the light  
He fears the truth  
He fears what's going to be  
He spits on life  
He spits on God  
He spits up death for you and me  
  
Prince of Darkness  
Studies the world with hungry eyes  
Prince of Darkness  
Ready to baptize you in lies  
Heart of evil  
Soul of blackness  
Prince of Darkness  
  
He saw the man was just a boy  
With a baby's mind  
He swore damnation of God's creation  
Waoh o-oh  
He lives for hate  
He lives for tears  
He lives up to his name  
He knew the light  
He knew the one  
Who was crucified in pain  
  
Prince of Darkness  
Studies the world with hungry eyes  
Prince of Darkness  
Ready to baptize you in lies  
Heart of evil  
Soul of blackness  
  
He fears the light  
He fears the truth  
He fears what's going to be  
He spits on life  
He spits on God  
He spits up death for you and me  
  
Prince of Darkness  
Studies the world with hungry eyes  
Prince of Darkness  
Ready to baptize you in lies  
Prince of Darkness  
Studies the world with hungry eyes  
Prince of Darkness  
Ready to baptize you in lies  
Prince of Darkness  
  
He smells the breath of sweet human sin  
And deeply breathes it in  
Prince of Darkness

Finally got a ride, some old broad down from Santa Fe  
She was a real go-getter  
She drawled so sweetly, "I think, child, that things'll get better"  
"Yes, I read the Bible", she said, "I want to know of you"  
  
We pulled off the highway, night black as a window  
Hey, I think I've got a live one  
Hey, I think I've got a live one, Yeah, Yeah  
I think I've got a live one  
  
Felt like I was hit by a dieselor a greyhound bus  
She was no baby-sitter  
"Get up, sugar, never thought you'd be a quitter"  
I opened the back door, she was greedy  
  
I ran through the desert, she was chasin  
No time to get dressed ,so I was naked , stranded in Chihuahua  
  
Alone raped and freezing  
Alone cold and sneezing  
Alone down in Mexico  
Alone

Rutting leaning on that crazy stuff  
Too many friends have died  
  
Got respect for the sleepers  
But the sleepers...

But probably not for years

From tv whiskey and beer

But the sleepers are dead
