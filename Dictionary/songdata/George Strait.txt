You've got to have an ace in the hole.  
A little secret that nobody knows.  
Life is a gamble, a game we all play,  
But you need to save something for a rainy day.  
You've got to learn to play your cards right if you expect to win in life.  
Don't put it all on the line for just one roll.  
You've got to have an ace in the hole.  
  
If you're headed down a one way street.  
And you're not sure it's the way you wanna go.  
In money or love, or all the above,  
Have a little more than what you show.  
When life deals out a surprise  
Have a few surprises of your own.  
No matter what you do, no matter where you go  
You've got to have an ace in the hole.  
  
You've got to have an ace in the hole.  
A little secret that nobody knows.  
Life is a gamble, a game we all play,  
But you need to save something for a rainy day.  
You've got to learn to play your cards right if you expect to win in life.  
Don't put it all on the line for just one roll.  
You've got to have an ace in the hole.  
  
Don't put it all on the line for just one roll  
You've got to have an ace in the hole.  
No matter what you do, no matter where you go  
You've got to have an ace in the hole.

[Chorus]  
Adalida, pretty little Cajun queen  
Sweet Dixie flower, the bell of the bayou  
You're every young mans dream  
Adalida, I'd walk through the hurricane  
To stand beside ya sweet Adalida I'd swim the Ponchartrain  
  
Oh no, here ya coming down the road  
With your cotton dress a swishing  
You're getting some attention  
From all the boys in Thibodaux  
Oh my, you're really filling up their eyes  
Smiling and a winking  
I know what they're thinking  
But I'm the only one who loves you so  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh no, the hottest little dish I know  
I know that you can tell it  
You're making me so jealous  
From my head down to my toes  
Oh me, you could make a red neck green  
The way that you're a looking  
You got me a cooking  
And I ain't talking bout Etoufee'  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
To stand beside ya sweet Adalida  
To stand beside ya sweet Adalida  
Just to stand beside of my sweet Adalida  
I'd swim the Ponchartrain

I know why I'm intrigued  
You keep surprisin' me  
Somewhere between the lines  
There's no way to define  
Every move you make  
Always never the same  
  
Call me mesmerized  
Somewhat hypnotized  
Somehow in conversation  
I'm lost in sweet temptation  
Every word you say  
Always never the same  
  
I can't count the ways  
You take my breathe away  
Always never the same  
  
I can't count the ways  
You take my breathe away  
Always never the same  
Always never the same  
Always never the same

Amarillo by mornin'  
Up from San Antone  
Everything that I got  
Is just what I've got on  
  
When that sun is high in that Texas sky  
I'll be buckin' at the county fair  
Amarillo by mornin'  
Amarillo, I'll be there  
  
They took my saddle in Houston  
Broke my leg in Santa Fe  
I lost my wife and a girlfriend  
Somewhere along the way  
  
But I'll be lookin' for 8 when they pull that gate  
And I hope that judge ain't blind  
Amarillo by mornin'  
Amarillo's on my mind  
  
Amarillo by mornin'  
Up from San Antone  
Everything that I got  
Is just what I've got on  
  
I ain't got a dime but what I got is mine  
I ain't rich but Lord I'm free  
Amarillo by mornin'  
Amarillo's where I'll be  
  
Amarillo by mornin'  
Amarillo's where I'll be

I've seen ladies look at me  
With want to in their eyes  
But each time they do  
I think of you and it makes me realize  
Just any old love won't do  
  
No, any old love won't do  
I don't want to love  
If it isn't with you  
Just any old love won't do  
  
You've got the only arms  
I've ever come runnin' to  
Love has always led me to your bed  
Just any old love won't do  
  
No, Any old love won't do  
Just any old love won't do  
I don't want to love  
If it isn't with you  
Just any old love won't do  
  
Just any old love won't do  
No, any old love won't do  
I don't want to love  
If it isn't with you  
Just any old love won't do  
  
No, any old love won't do  
Just any old love won't do  
I don't want to love  
If it isn't with you  
Just, any old love won't do  
  
No, any old love won't do  
Just any old love won't do  
I don't want to love  
If it isn't with you  
Just, any old love won't do.

Lately I've found myself fallin'  
Deeper in love with you  
I'm not the kind of guy  
Who gets swept away  
So here's what I'm gonna do  
I'm gonna give you this heart of mine  
But that's where I draw the line  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm only gonna give you everything  
Take it a mile beyond the end of the road  
I'm gonna love you one day past forever  
But that's as far as it goes  
  
I know it may not sound like much  
But baby, make no mistake  
I'm gonna treat you with more tenderness  
Than any one woman can take  
I'm gonna make all your dreams come true  
But after that, baby, I'm through  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You've got your limits, I've got mine  
I'm only gonna go the distance  
Time after time  
  
[Chorus]  
  
But that's as far as it goes

[Chorus]  
Away in a manger  
No crib for a bed  
The little lord Jesus laid down his sweet head  
The stars in the sky look down where he lay  
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay  
  
The cattle all glory the baby awakes  
But little Lord Jesus no crying he makes  
I love the Lord Jesus look down from the sky  
And stay by my cradle till morning is ney.  
  
[Chorus]  
Away in a manger  
No crib for a bed  
The little lord Jesus laid down his sweet head  
The stars in the sky look down where he lay  
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay.

I'm back to bein' me  
I'm back to bein' nobody  
The who I was before I was your used to be  
I'm back to bein' me  
I'm back to who I was  
Before I was the one who fell in love  
With the one who never, ever was in love  
I'm back to bein' me  
  
These eyes that used to cry myself to sleep  
Now they're dry they don't lay me down to weep  
For the first time in a long time I like seeing what I see  
No thanks to you  
I'm back to bein' me  
  
These eyes that used to cry myself to sleep  
Now they're dry they don't lay me down to weep  
For the first time in a long time I like seeing what I see  
No thanks to you  
I'm back to bein' me  
  
I'm back to bein' me  
I'm back to bein' nobody  
The who I was before I was your used to be  
I'm back to bein' me  
I'm back to who I was  
Before I was the one who fell in love  
With the one who never, ever was in love  
I'm back to bein' me  
  
I'm back to bein' me  
I'm back to bein' me

Never thought too much about her leavin'  
I'd find someone there was no doubt  
But this time the feelin' is strange and different  
Since she's been gone there's one thing I found out  
  
[Chorus]  
It takes a mighty man to live with lonesome  
Some big men might live with misery  
But there's one thing I know, for sure it's certain  
It's for sure it's gonna take a lot bigger man than me  
  
I've never suffered much in the hurtin' line  
I've always been as good as any man  
But show me who can lose in love and like it  
And I'll be the first to proudly shake his hand

In a bar in Acuna called Ma Crosby's  
I found myself not feeling any pain  
I told a 'Frisco girl I'd come for freedom  
She said she'd only come to catch a train  
  
We struck up some idle conversation  
Traded all the troubles on our minds  
One thing led to another in the evening  
And I fell in love again for my last time  
  
Blame it on Mexico if you need a reason  
Say too much guitar music, tequila, salt and lime  
Blame it on Mexico, but she's the reason  
That I fell in love again for my last time  
  
Daylight dawned and found me in Del Rio  
In a rundown motel room as dark as hell  
I felt all the pains of a morning after  
And all alone as far as I could tell  
  
Why she left I have no way of knowing  
I guess she caught her train and that's a crime  
She took everything I ever wanted  
And I fell in love again for my last time  
Blame it on Mexico if you need a reason  
Say too much guitar music, tequila, salt and lime  
Blame it on Mexico, but she's the reason

You swear you've had enough, you're ready to give up  
On that little lie they call love, then out of the blue clear sky  
Fallin' right into your hands, like rain on the desert sand  
It's the last thing you had planned out of the blue clear sky.  
  
Here she comes a walkin' talkin' true love  
Sayin' I been lookin' for you love  
Surprise your new love has arrived  
Out of the blue clear sky.  
  
Ain't love a funny thing, one day you're givin' up the dream  
And the next you're pickin' out a ring out of the blue clear sky.  
  
Here she comes a walkin' talkin' true love  
Sayin' I been lookin' for you love  
Surprise your new love has arrived  
Out of the blue clear sky.

I've never once in my life met someone like you  
I don't know what the word blue means  
As long as I'm with you  
You fill me so completely through everything you do  
Blue is not a word at all  
As long as I'm with you  
  
Most of the time in my past  
Blue is all I knew  
But now that we're together  
O' how I love you  
I'm so glad I've found you  
You've made my dreams come true  
Blue is not a word at all  
As long as I'm with you  
  
Most of the time in my past  
Blue is all I knew  
But now that we're together  
O' how I love you  
I'm so glad I've found you  
You've made my dreams come true  
Blue is not a word at all  
As long as I'm with you

I don't know how to write you a song  
That says, I'm sorry, I know I was wrong  
I can't find the words that don't make it cheap  
It's right on the verge and just out of reach  
It must be a sad song with a blue melody  
And I'll bet you it's lonesome, as lonesome as can be  
But I'm starting to wonder if there's such a thing  
As a sad song that's too sad to sing  
  
Maybe tonight, maybe this time tomorrow  
Me and this guitar will get right with this sorrow  
And I'll play it for you, and you'll come back to me  
'Cause you were always a fool for the blue melodies  
  
So it must be a sad song in three quarter time  
That chills down to the bone when the steel guitars cry  
But if it's not the one that brings you home to me  
Then it's just a sad song that's too sad to sing  
  
Awe but if it's not the one that brings you back to me  
Then it's just a sad song that's too sad to sing  
  
Oh, it's just a sad song that's too sad to sing

Oh, I've been stumblin' through the darkness  
Tryin' to feel the ground beneath my feet  
Afraid of movin' much in any direction  
Stuck where the past and the future meet  
  
But I fin'lly got my first good look  
A little fire was all it too  
An' as the flames grew brighter  
I saw everything that I'd missed  
Once you get your courage up  
You light a match an' your eyes adjust  
It's amazing what a man can see  
By the light of a burnin' bridge  
  
An' there were things I saw that I'm not proud of  
Things that I'd do diff'rent now from then  
But when I really make myself get honest  
It's over and I can't go back again  
  
'Cause I fin'lly got my first good look  
A little fire was all it took  
An' as the flames grew brighter  
I saw everything that I'd missed  
Once you get your courage up  
You light a match an' your eyes adjust  
It's amazing what a man can see  
By the light of a burnin' bridge  
  
It sure is hard to let go and to leave the past behind  
But there ain't no other way that you can find some peace of mind  
  
When I fin'lly got my first good look  
A little fire was all it took  
An' as the flames grew brighter  
I saw everything that I'd missed  
Once you get your courage up  
You light a match an' your eyes adjust  
It's amazing what a man can see  
By the light of a burnin' bridge  
It's amazing what a man can see  
By the light of a burnin' bridge

Baby all I've got is this beat-up leather bag  
And everything I own don't fill up half  
But don't you worry 'bout the way I pack  
All I care about is getting back real soon  
A good-bye kiss is all I need from you  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause I'm carrying your love with me  
West Virginia down to Tennessee  
I'll be moving with the good Lord's speed  
Carrying your love with me  
It's my strength, for holding on  
Every minute that I have to be gone  
I'll have everything I'll ever need  
Carrying your love with me  
  
On a lonely highway, stuck out in the rain  
Darling all I have to do is speak your name  
The clouds rollback and the waters part  
The sun starts shining in my heart for you  
You're right there in everything I do  
  
[Chorus: x2]

It started way back in third grade  
I used to sit beside Emmylou Hayes  
A pink dress, a matching bow, and her ponytail  
She kissed me on the school bus but told me not to tell  
Next day I chased her around the playground  
Cross the monkey bars to the merry-go-round  
And Emmylou got caught passing me a note  
Before the teacher took it I read what she wrote  
  
[Chorus]  
Do you love me do you want to be my friend  
And if you do  
Well then don't be afraid to take me by the hand  
If you want to  
I think this is how love goes  
Check yes or no  
  
Now we're grown up and she's my wife  
Still like two kids with stars in our eyes  
Not much has changed I still chase Emmylou  
Up and down the hall around the bed in our room  
Last night I took her out in a white limousine  
Twenty years together she still gets to me  
Can't believe it's been that long ago  
When we got started with just a little note  
  
[Chorus]

C'mon along and we'll go down  
To a place in Texas called Cow Town  
You'll never meet a stranger there  
Everybody knows if you're in town  
  
They'll meet you with a smile and a  
'Howdy, how you all?' and just a little while  
You'll get that Texas drawl  
The hats are wide, and the boots are brown  
You'll just love this place called Cow Town  
  
No matter where I may wonder  
No matter where I may roam  
There's a place way down yonder  
I'm goin' there and make it my home  
  
C'mon along and we'll go down  
To a place in Texas called Cow Town  
You'll never meet a stranger there  
Everybody knows if you're in town  
  
They'll meet you with a smile and a  
'Howdy, how you all?' and just a little while  
You'll get that Texas drawl  
The hats are wide, and the boots are brown  
You'll just love this place called Cow Town  
  
You'll just love this place called Cow Town

It's dance time in Texas and were striking up the band  
Let's go honky tonkin' honey take my hand  
  
It's dance time in Texas where the wine and music flows  
We'll do that Texas two step and that old cotton eyed Joe  
I'll take you honky tonkin' in my old pick up truck  
It's dance time in Texas and the music lifts you up  
It's dance time in Texas and were striking up the band  
We'll go honky tonkin' honey take my hand  
  
It's dance time in Texas where the wine and music flows  
We'll do that Texas two step and that old cotton eyed Joe  
Now it's time for a slow dance and we're waltzing oh so close  
It's dance time in Texas and your the one I love the most  
It's dance time in Texas and were striking up the band  
We'll go honky tonkin' honey take my hand  
It's dance time in Texas where the wine and music flows

The stars at night - are big and bright  
Deep in the heart of texas.  
The prairie sky - is wide and high  
Deep in the heart of texas.  
The sage in bloom - is like perfume  
Deep in the heart of texas.  
Reminds me of - the one I love  
Deep in the heart of texas.  
The cowboys cry - ki-yip-pie-yi  
Deep in the heart of texas.  
The rabbits rush - around the brush  
Deep in the heart of texas.  
The coyotes wail - along the trail  
Deep in the heart of texas.  
The doggies bawl - and bawl and bawl  
Deep in the heart of texas.

Well I'm out on a tear 'cause she's tearing me apart  
If I look rough on the outside, you ought to see my heart.  
And this look in my eyes shows beyond a doubt,  
Since my woman left, I'm down and out.  
  
Well, I'm down at the bar, out of my mind,  
Tighter than an eight-day clock with no way to unwind,  
That jukebox cries the blues like it knows what I'm about.  
Since my woman left, I'm down and out.  
  
Well I'm down to my last dollar, but I don't really care.  
My friends have all got whiskey, and they don't mind if I share.  
They know how it feels to have your heart torn inside out,  
Since my woman left, I'm down and out.  
  
Well, I'm down at the bar, out of my mind,  
Tighter than an eight-day clock with no way to unwind,  
That jukebox cries the blues like it knows what I'm about.  
Since my woman left, I'm down and out.  
  
Since my woman left, since my woman left,

I'm drinking champagne, feeling no pain 'till early morning  
Dinning and dancing with every pretty girl I can find  
I'm having a fling with a pretty young thing 'till early morning  
Knowing tomorrow I'll wake up with you on my mind  
  
Guilty conscience I guess  
I must confess  
I never loved you much when you were mine  
  
So I'll keep drinking champagne, feeling no pain 'till early morning  
Dinning and dancing with every pretty girl I can find  
Having a fling with a pretty young thing 'till early morning  
Knowing tomorrow I'll wake up with you on my mind  
  
Guilty conscience I guess  
I must confess  
I never loved you much when you were mine  
  
So I'll keep drinking champagne, feeling no pain 'till early morning  
Dinning and dancing with every pretty girl I can find  
I'll keep having a fling with a pretty young thing 'till early morning  
Knowing tomorrow I'll wake up with you on my mind

Every time my ship comes in  
A hurricane blows it out again  
Stormy weather seems to hang around my door  
My sweet bird of paradise  
Flew the coop on me last night  
Oh, and every time it rains, lord don't it pour  
  
I got a letter from the I. Are. S  
They said, son, you're in a hell of a mess  
Our computer shows you owe ten-thousand more  
That machine's made a bad mistake  
'cause that's more than this poor boy makes  
Oh, and every time it rains, lord don't it pour  
  
Every time it rains I just wash my car  
The whole neighbourhood goes  
Swimmin' in my front yard  
Well, my mother-in-law says she's  
Stayin' three weeks more  
Oh, and every time it rains, lord don't it pour  
  
Just got my car out of the shop  
Two blocks down the street it stopped  
I went to use the telephone at the grocery store  
I walked back to my chevrolet  
But they towed that sucker away  
Oh, and every time it rains, lord don't it pour  
  
Every time it rains I just wash my car  
The whole neighbourhood goes  
Swimmin' in my front yard  
Well, my mother-in-law says she's  
Stayin' three weeks more  
Oh, and every time it rains, lord don't it pour  
Well, every time it rains, lord don't it pour

Well I haven't seen her lately, and she never calls.  
She don't ask my friends about me, gives no clues at all.  
Yeah the fire might still be burnin' yeah,  
But I'd say she's about as gone as a girl can get.  
  
She don't even show up in my dreams at night,  
But my stubborn ol' memory keeps holdin' on tight.  
Sure makes it hard to forget  
She's about as gone as a girl can get.  
  
She's outta here, she disappeared without a trace.  
More or less unimpressed by the tears on my face.  
Her destination unknown, she just dropped out of sight,  
Last seen headin' right on out of my life.  
Like a stranger I ain't never met,  
She's about as gone as a girl can get,  
  
She's outta here, she disappeared without a trace.  
More or less unimpressed by the tears on my face.  
Her destination unknown, she just dropped out of sight,  
Last seen headin' right on out of my life.  
Like a stranger I ain't never met,  
She's about as gone as a girl can get,  
  
Like a stranger I ain't never met,  
I'd say she's about as gone as a girl can get.

I've got some good news, can't wait to tell you.  
I realized I missed you, since we've been apart.  
I just needed time,  
To make up my mind,  
But I'm in love with you with all my heart.  
I've got some good news.  
  
I got some bad news, I don't know how to break to you.  
I found someone new since we been apart.  
I had too much time,  
An' he took you off my mind,  
An' I'm in love with him with all of my heart.  
I got some bad news.  
  
An' I guess all is fair in love an' war:  
Someone wins,  
But someone wins more.  
You never know what time will do.  
All I know is I've got some good news.  
I've got some bad news.

Oh, I know a place called Good Time Charley's  
A little four piece band swingin' out of sight  
And I'll be here if you want to party  
Come nine in the morning 'til twelve at night  
Two miles from town 'cross the railroad track  
Turn right at the light and park in the back  
You're always welcome, don't forget to drop in  
Old Good Time Charley's, any time you can  
Well, I heard talk 'bout a trouble-maker  
Dropped in one night and never came again  
Well, they said he left with an undertaker  
Old Charley's done time, two years in the pen  
Well, the beat goes on, there's a hardwood floor  
And the sound of laughter runnin' out the door  
Wall to wall women, plenty of ice-cold beer  
Anything you're after you can find in here  
Two miles from town 'cross the railroad track  
Turn right at the light and park in the back  
You're always welcome, don't forget to drop in  
Old Good Time Charley's, any time you can  
And you're always welcome, don't forget to drop in  
Old Good Time Charley's, any time you can  

Haven't you heard, Daddy's gone crazy  
Haven't you heard, Mama is gone  
  
Here I stand with my finger on his doorbell  
My mind goes back to what I did last night  
You see I finally talked his wife into leaving him  
And I'm just trying to convince my conscience that it's alright  
  
Well I can see my old friend sittin there just starin  
And his little boy is cryin words that are welded in my mind  
  
Haven't you heard, Daddy's gone crazy  
Haven't you heard, Mama is gone  
And either way I am the loser  
And I've been crying all night long  
Mister haven't you heard  
  
Haven't you heard, Daddy's gone crazy  
Haven't you heard, Mama is gone  
And either way I am the loser  
And I've been crying all night long  
Mister haven't you heard

You put your best red dress on  
And came here tonight all alone  
He must have really hurt you bad  
Ordered up a double coke and rum  
And hope it'll turn into fun  
He must have really hurt you bad  
I don't know your story but it ain't hard to see  
You've a heart that's broken as a heart can be  
It's probably not like you at all  
To mix loneliness and alcohol  
He must have really hurt you bad  
Now it's 1 a.m. and here you are  
With some stranger at the bar  
He must have really hurt you bad  
  
Across town in some motel room  
He'll try to heal your past  
While the one that's lying next o you is only there for laughs  
He must have really hurt you bad  
  
Now I'm the Joe that sets you up then cuts you off  
And calls a cab when you need me to  
And I'd like to say that only once in a while  
I see someone goin' what you're goin' through  
  
Well, I need the tips, but I'll be alright  
If I don't see you tomorrow night  
Stay home girl  
He must have really hurt you bad  
  
He must have really hurt you bad

Now who wouldn't notice the fire in your eyes  
Or the bitter direction of impending good-byes  
I've followed and folded, i'm wilted in place  
At the sight of you standing with streaks down your face  
  
With your heart broke and running from the reason  
You got your heart broke, don't give up on believing in me  
Heart broke, who kept me from leaving?  
With my heart broke  
  
Now pride is a drag and a bore when you're lonely  
Sheer madness prevails upon reason to you  
But all is not lost, it's only mistaken  
That's small consolation but i know just how you feel  
  
With your heart broke and running from the reason  
You got your heart broke, don't give up on believing in me  
Heart broke , who kept me from leaving?  
With my heart broke  
  
Nobody said it was going to be easy  
We all have feelings that need a softer touch  
But nobody said that it would not be worth it  
The human condition continues as such  
  
With your heart broke and running from the reason  
You've got your heart broke, don't give up on believing in me  
Heart broke, who kept me from leaving?  
With my heart broke, youove got me heart broke

You came into my life like an answer to a prayer  
Like a star that falls from the sky right out of thin air  
Some might say it's a miracle or a dream come true  
But from that day I always knew  
  
[Chorus]  
Heaven is missing an angel  
That's the only thing that it can be  
Heaven is missing an angel  
Cause you're right here with me  
  
No one else in the world has touched me like you do  
It's super natural, girl, the way I feel when I'm with you  
I'm in paradise whenever you're around  
Then when I look in your eyes there's no doubt  
  
Heaven is missing an angel  
That's the only thing that it can be  
Heaven is missing an angel  
Cause you're right here with me  
  
I'm in paradise whenever you're around  
Then when I look in your eyes there's no doubt  
  
Heaven is missing an angel  
That's the only thing that it can be  
Heaven is missing an angel  
Cause you're right here with me  
  
Right here with me  
You're right here

There's never been a man  
who could bring me down  
I've walked away from the toughest of towns  
But her last words tore me apart  
Her good bye hit me in the heart  
Her good bye hit me in the heart  
  
Her good bye hit me in the heart  
Brought me to knees like a shot from the dark  
Her sweet love found its mark  
Her good bye hit me in the heart  
Her good bye hit me in the heart  
  
Her soft warm touch took me by surprise  
I was blinded by the love in my eyes  
The moment she left I felt the pain start  
Her good bye hit me in the heart  
Her good bye hit me in the heart  
  
Her good bye hit me in the heart  
Brought me to my knees  
like a shot from the dark  
Her sweet love found its mark  
Her good bye hit me in the heart

She's an angel and I ain't  
Lord knows she deserves a saint  
And it don't take a genius to see  
Her only bad habit is me  
  
Why she loves me I don't know  
I can sure be a hard way to go  
But I'm right here where she wants me to be  
Her only bad habit is me  
  
Most of the time I'm walking the line  
But sometimes I get out of hand  
My baby scolds me and later on she holds me  
She loves me and she understands  
She's perfection, she's a ten  
My baby never looks at other men  
She has just one weakness I see  
Her only bad habit is me  
  
Most of the time I'm walking the line  
But sometimes I get out of hand  
My baby scolds me and later on she holds me  
She loves me and she understands  
She's perfection, she's a ten  
My baby never looks at other men  
She has just one weakness I see  
Her only bad habit is me  
  
Her only bad habit... is me

I'm not going to lay around and whine and moan  
'Cause somebody done done me wrong  
Don't think for a minute  
That I'm gonna sit around and sing some old sad song  
I believe it's half full, not a half empty glass  
Every day I wake up knowing it could be my last  
  
I ain't here for a long time  
I'm here for a good time  
So bring on some sunshine, to hell with the red wine  
Pour me some moonshine  
When I am gone put it in stone, he left nothing behind'  
I ain't here for a long time  
I'm here for a good time  
  
Folks are always dreaming about what they like to do  
But I like to do just what I like  
I'll take the chance, dance the dance  
It might be wrong but then again it might be right  
There's no way of knowing what tomorrow brings  
Life's too short to waste it I say bring on anything  
  
I ain't here for a long time  
I'm here for a good time  
So bring on the sunshine to hell with the red wine  
Pour me some moonshine  
  
When I'm gone put it in stone,  
"He left nothing behind"  
I ain't here for a long time  
I'm here for a good time  
I ain't here for a long time  
I'm here for a good time

Here we go again  
She's back in town again  
I'll take her back again one more time  
Here we go again  
The phone will ring again  
I'll be her fool again one more time  
  
I've been there before  
And I'll try it again  
But any fool knows  
That theres no way to win  
  
Here we go again  
She'll brake my heart again  
But any fool knows  
That theres no way to win  
  
Here we go again  
She'll brake my heart again  
I'll play the part again one more time  
  
I'll take her back again  
Just one more time

I've always said "I do" too easy,  
And now I'm payin' the price.  
A weakness for beautiful women  
Is my most expensive vice.  
I still believe in matrimony,  
But I can't afford another try.  
Child support and alimony  
Is just about to bleed me dry.  
  
I've got ex's all across the country  
And I owe everybody in town.  
I've got bill collectors callin' me up  
And lawyers tryin' to track me down.  
I'm just one wrong move from the poor house,  
But I don't belong in there.  
I've got so many ex's and owe so much,  
I ought to be on Hollywood Squares,  
Yeah I ought to be on Hollywood Squares.  
  
Lookin' back over my love life,  
I only have myself to blame.  
I guess I should've checked the price tag  
Before I gave 'em my last name.  
Now my credit ratin's in the gutter,  
And the bottom line sure looks bad.  
I'll be payin' the rest of my life  
For the few good times I've had.  
  
I've got ex's all across the country  
And I owe everybody in town.  
I've got bill collectors callin' me up  
And lawyers tryin' to track me down.  
I'm just one wrong move from the poor house,  
But I don't belong in there.  
I've got so many ex's and owe so much,  
I ought to be on Hollywood Squares,  
Yeah they ought to put me on Hollywood Squares.

The walls that surround us are slowly crumblin' down  
But the heart of this foundation is still on solid ground  
Just need some renovation and a lot of TLC  
And a long night of lovin' is all that we both need  
  
So roll the shades down  
Lock the doors up tight, turn on the code-a-phone  
If the door bell rings  
We'll just stay in bed and pretend nobody's home  
Let the neighbors think we moved away or forgot to pay the rent  
There ain't nothing wrong with this old house  
It just needs a little home improvement  
  
Every day we go our separate ways  
To make our dreams come true  
But it ain't worth the sacrifice  
If we're giving up me and you  
We gotta hold on tighter than tight  
To the lies that make us strong  
And get back to the roots  
That made this house a home  
  
So roll the shades down  
Lock the doors up tight, turn on the code-a-phone  
If the door bell rings  
We'll just stay in bed and pretend nobody's home  
Let the neighbors think we moved away or forgot to pay the rent  
There ain't nothing wrong with this old house  
It just needs a little home improvement  
  
So roll the shades down  
Lock the doors up tight, turn on the code-a-phone  
If the door bell rings  
We'll just stay in bed and pretend nobody's home  
Let the neighbors think we moved away or forgot to pay the rent  
There ain't nothing wrong with this old house  
It just needs a little home improvement

Well, I got a bumper sticker  
On the back of my truck  
There ain't another like it  
'Cause I had it made up  
I can tell who's behind me  
They give themselves away  
Lay on their horn when they read this phrase  
  
[Chorus]  
Honk if you honky tonk  
Don't if you don't  
But, if you do  
Don't you love to  
Honk if you honky tonk  
  
Me and Friday night go hand in hand  
Ice cold beer and a swingin' band  
A girl on my arm that won't let go  
She caught my little sign about a mile ago  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well, just the other day I was cruisin' through town  
Sheriff pulled me over, I thought I had it now  
I rolled down my window, he said with a grin  
"I want one of them stickers or I'm gonna run you in."  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Honk if you honky tonk  
  
I hear ya honkin', yeah  
I'm pullin' over,  
Let's honky tonk

Thought I'd go crazy when you said goodbye  
I didn't have that far to go  
But I made a wrong turn somewhere in the night  
Down a long and lonely road  
  
[Chorus]  
To Honkytonkville, an ideal  
Home away from home sweet home  
Honkytonkville where I don't feel  
A thing since you've been gone  
Where the future's always bright  
In the glow of neon lights  
Livin' high on Barstool Hill in Honkytonkville  
  
There's friendly faces everywhere I turn  
Droppin' quarters in the slot  
Lord knows that we've all got memories to burn  
And that's why that jukebox plays around the clock  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Livin' high on Barstool Hill in Honkytonkville

She left me almost burned out  
I couldn't feel a thing  
A walkin' talkin' statue  
Afraid to love again  
She did everything to kill a flame  
But a little spark got through  
She'd of got her way  
I'd be gone today  
If it hadn't been for you  
  
You turn cold gray ashes into  
Hot burning flames  
I'm alive with love because of you  
When you came to light the fire  
I knew just what to bring  
You turn cold gray ashes into  
Hot burning flames  
  
She thought she had me down and out  
But at the count of nine  
A livin' lovin' angel  
Showed up just in time  
She thought that I would surely die  
Sometimes I wanted to  
She had no doubt  
The fire was out  
But she didn't count on you  
  
You turn cold gray ashes into  
Hot burning flames  
I'm alive with love because of you  
When you came to light the fire  
I knew just what to bring  
You turn cold gray ashes into  
Hot burning flames  
  
You turn cold gray ashes into  
Hot burning flames  
I'm alive with love because of you  
When you came to light the fire  
I knew just what to bring  
You turn cold gray ashes into  
Hot burning flames  
  
You turn cold gray ashes into  
Hot burning flames

Walkin' down this lonely stretch of beach  
She and I, walked down a thousand times  
I just can't force myself to give her up  
Like all the things she left behind  
Gone are the days when I'd wake up  
With her warm body next to mine  
  
It gets cold here in the wintertime  
And my mind drifts away  
To that house across the bay.  
A long talk and a glass of wine  
And we'd love the night away,  
But that was yesterday  
In that house across the bay.  
  
Her laughter was contagious  
Her walk, her talk, her smile lit up every room.  
They say things happen for a reason,  
But I can't find one good reason  
Why she's gone so soon.  
Life just seems to hang  
On every thought and everything  
We used to be.  
  
It gets cold here in the wintertime  
And my mind drifts away  
To that house across the bay.  
A long talk and a glass of wine  
And we'd love the night away,  
But that was yesterday  
In that house across the bay.  
  
There was sunshine everyday  
And we'd love the night away  
In that house across the bay.

I felt the rush of the Rio Grande into Yellowstone  
I've seen first-hand Niagara Falls  
And the lights of Vegas  
I've Criss-crossed down to Key Biscayne  
And Chi-town via Bangor, Maine  
Think I've seen it all  
And all I can say is  
  
[Chorus]  
How 'bout them cowgirls  
Boys ain't they something  
Sure are some proud girls  
And you can't tell them nothing  
And I tell you right now girls  
May just be seven wonders of this big, whole round world  
But how 'bout them cowgirls  
  
She's riding colts in Steamboat Springs  
Bailing hay outside Abilene  
She's trying hard  
To fit in some city  
But her home is 'neath that big, blue sky  
And the Northern Plains and those other wide open spaces  
Now a-days there ain't as many but  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Boy, she don't need you and she don't need me  
She can do just fine on her own two feet  
But she wants a man who wants her to be herself  
And she'll never change, don't know how to hide  
Her stubborn will or her fighting side  
But you treat her right and she'll love you like no one else  
  
Yeah, how 'bout them cowgirls  
Boys ain't they something  
Sure are some proud girls  
But you can't beat their loving  
  
And I'll tell you right now girls  
May just be seven wonders of this big, old round world  
But how 'bout them cowgirls  
How 'bout 'em boys

I pack up my saddle  
Throw it in that two-horse trailer  
Back up my truck, hook 'em up  
And drive away  
Won't be the first time  
But this time's the last time  
She meant it when she said  
That's all I've got to say  
Never had been thrown like this before  
I ain't her cowboy anymore  
  
Never saw it comin'  
But I knew where it was goin'  
When she asked how long this time  
Before I hit the road  
She didn't come right out and say it  
But I sure got the message  
When I reached out to hold her  
That shoulder sure was cold  
Figured I'd just let goodbye run its course  
I ain't her cowboy anymore  
  
[Chorus]  
These white lines are a blur  
Like the last few nights I spent with her  
I don't know where I went wrong  
Or if I did  
Like the good ol' boy I am  
I told her that I understand  
But Lord knows that I won't long as I live  
Seems lately every time it rains it pours  
I ain't her cowboy anymore  
  
We met in Denver  
Settled down in Dallas  
The best days of my life  
Were the ones I spent with her  
You'd think that all that lovin' ought to count for something  
Guess I wore out my welcome  
Like the rowels of these old spurs  
That Casper sunset's what I'm shootin' for  
'Cause I ain't her cowboy anymore  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Her cowboy anymore  
I ain't her cowboy anymore

I've traveled through lots of places  
Seen lots of folks and lots of faces  
Even settled down a time or two  
I've worked the farms, I've been to town  
Guess you could say I've been around  
But I ain't never seen no one like you  
  
I can tell by your smile you don't believe a word I say  
You're thinkin' I'll just stay awhile then be on my way  
But girl I think it's far to warn ya  
I've done been to California  
I ain't never seen no one like you  
  
I knew a girl in Mississippi  
Had twenty different ways to kiss me  
Never found a thing she couldn't do  
Hey I even knew some twins in Denver  
Stayed with them one cold December  
I ain't never seen no one like you  
  
I can tell by your smile you don't believe a word I say  
You're thinkin' I'll just stay awhile then be on my way  
But girl I think it's far to warn ya  
I've done been to California  
I ain't never seen no one like you  
  
East to west north to south  
You're the very best girl there ain't no doubt  
I'm tellin' you you're really somethin'  
The way you got my heart a jumpin'  
I ain't never seen no one like you  
  
I can tell by your smile you don't believe a word I say  
You're thinkin' I'll just stay awhile then be on my way  
But girl I think it's far to warn ya  
I've done been to California  
I ain't never seen no one like you  
  
Hey girl I think it's far to warn ya  
I've done been to California  
But I ain't never seen no one like you  
Ah yeah

The night's as clear as a big desert sky  
But it's hard to see the stars with these tears in my eyes  
Yeah, it's hard not to cry  
There's twenty-six reasons why  
  
There's broken hearts that'll never be the same  
Shattered lives still reeling from the pain  
Of plans and dreams now gone  
Oh, how do you move on?  
  
But I believe  
There's someone who's looking after me  
Someone beside me night and day  
To light the way  
It's hard to conceive  
Something you can't see  
But I believe  
I believe  
  
There's twenty-six angels looking down from above  
Resting in his mercy, grace and love  
Time may never heel  
The sadness that we feel  
  
But I believe  
There's someone who's looking after me  
Someone beside me night and day  
To light the way  
It's hard to conceive  
Something you can't see  
But I believe  
I believe  
  
The rivers flow now that used to be dry  
As people all over the world start to cry  
But I believe

Her telephone rang 'bout a quarter to nine  
She heard his voice on the other end of the line  
She wondered what was wrong this time  
She never knew what his calls might bring  
With a cowboy like him, it could be anything  
And she always expected the worst  
In the back of her mind  
  
He said, it's cold out here and I'm all alone  
I didn't make the short go again and I'm coming home  
I know I've been away too long  
I never got a chance to write or call  
And I know this rodeo has been hard on us all  
But I'll be home soon  
And honey is there somethin' wrong  
  
She said, don't bother comin' home  
By time you get here I'll be long gone  
There's somebody new and he sure ain't no rodeo man  
He said, I'm sorry it's come down to this  
There's so much about you that I'm gonna miss  
But it's alright baby  
If I hurry I can still make Cheyenne  
Gotta go now baby  
If I hurry I can still make Cheyenne  
  
He left that phone danglin' off the hook  
Then slowly turned around and gave it one last look  
Then he just walked away  
He aimed his truck toward that Wyoming line  
With a little luck he could still get there in time  
And in that Cheyenne wind he could still hear her say  
  
She said, don't bother comin' home  
By time you get here I'll be long gone  
There's somebody new and he sure ain't no rodeo man  
He said, I'm sorry it's come down to this  
There's so much about you that I'm gonna miss  
But it's alright baby  
If I hurry I can still make Cheyenne  
Gotta go now baby  
If I hurry I can still make Cheyenne  
  
She never knew what his calls might bring  
With a cowboy like him, it could be anything  
And she always expected the worst  
In the back of her mind

I don't get along  
With people who aren't kind  
I don't get along  
With folks with only money on their minds  
  
And I don't get along with someone  
Who's always trying to tell me what to do  
But on and on  
I get along with you  
  
Well I don't like  
People always tellin' me that I should change  
They get simple lives  
and they think they've got my life to rearrange  
  
But they don't understand  
Exactly what love boils down to  
Cause on and on  
I get along with you  
  
Well all it takes to please me  
Is waking in the morning feeling you by my side  
And all I ever needed  
Is knowin' that I'm needed in your life  
  
I may not do  
All the things that other people want me to  
But on and on  
I'll get along with you.  
  
Yeah on and on  
I'll get along with you.

She was leaning on a rail in a cotton dress  
Summer tanned pretty, little perfect mess  
With a story that could only be anybody's guess  
And I was thinking that I probably didn't stand a chance  
But I rolled up my sleeves, walked up and I said  
Hey, I don't know you but I'd kinda like a shot  
She said, I saw you comin' over, I already thought it over  
And OK, so now what  
  
And I said, well I got a car, she said, there's something  
At least it's a start, I said, it's better than nothing  
I ain't in no hurry but I'm ready when you are  
And she said, where do you think all this is going  
I said, there ain't no way of knowing  
I guess I hadn't thought it through that far  
But I got a car  
  
So, we let the wheels turn and the windows down  
We let ourselves go all the way through town  
She never said stop and I never asked her why  
We drove into the night, when outta nowhere  
She said, I'd give anything to never go back there  
And I kinda wish this day would never end  
She said, I could use a change but I don't even know where  
  
And I said, well I got a car, she said, there's something  
At least it's a start, I said, it's better than nothing  
I ain't in no hurry but I'm ready when you are  
And she said, where do you think all this is going  
I said, there ain't no way of knowing  
I really hadn't thought it through that far  
And I can't promise you the moon and stars  
But I got a car  
  
We got lost in the miles, lost track of the days  
'Til we finally found a stopping place  
When the doctor's said, you know what's on the way?  
And we found ourselves in a little white house  
One Sunday morning, rain pouring down  
She said, I think it's time but all the lines are out  
  
And her eyes teared up and she said, what are we gonna do now?  
And I said, well I got a car, she said, there's something  
You think it'll start, I said, it's already running  
Got your things in the back and I'm ready when you are  
She said, are you sure it'll get us where we're goin'?  
I said, if there's one thing I know girl, it's gotten us this far  
And I don't mean to hurry but I'm ready when you are

He was sitting there beside me throwing doubles down  
When he ordered up his third one he looked around  
Then he looked at me  
And said, "I do believe  
I'll have one more."  
He said, "I hate this bar and I hate to drink,  
But on second thought, tonight I think, I hate everything."  
  
Then he opened up his billfold and threw a twenty down,  
And a faded photograph fell out and hit the ground.  
I picked it up,  
He said, "thank you, bud."  
I put it in his hand.  
He said, "I probably oughta throw this one away  
'cause she's the reason I feel this way.  
I hate everything."  
  
I hate my job  
And I hate my life  
And if it weren't for my two kids  
I'd hate my ex wife.  
I know I should move on and try to start again,  
But I just can't get over her leaving me for him.  
Then he shook his head, looked down at his ring, said, "I hate everything."  
  
Said, "that one bedroom apartment where I get my mail,  
Is really not a home, it's more like a jail,  
With a swimming pool, and a parking lot view.  
Man, it's just great.  
I hate summer, winter, fall and spring.  
Red and yellow, purple, blue and green.  
I hate everything."  
  
I hate my job  
And I hate my life  
And if it weren't for my two kids  
I'd hate my ex wife.  
I know I should move on and try to start again,  
But I just can't get over her leaving me for him.  
Then he shook his head, looked down at his ring, said, "I hate everything."  
  
So I pulled out my phone and I called my house.  
I said, "Babe, I'm coming home, we're gonna work this out."  
I payed for his drinks  
And I told him thanks  
Thanks for everything.

?Tis the season for generosity  
A time to give and to receive  
My Christmas list consists of just one sweet dream  
  
I know what I want for Christmas this year  
I hope my note got to Santa on time  
I'm a little bit nervous  
It's kind of a big thing I'm asking for  
I don't know if I deserve it but boy if I get it  
I'll never ask for anything more  
It shines, it's new  
And it's the one wish that I wish would come true  
This year for Christmas I just wanna be with you  
  
We can build a little fire  
We can sit and talk for hours  
We'll just have fun  
You can tell me what you did  
Christmas morning as a kid  
And we'll talk about all our Christmases to come  
  
And if I hang a little mistletoe in every single doorway  
I'm sure to get a kiss  
And is it too much to ask for a snowman kind of snow  
To complete this singular wish  
It shines, it's new  
I know what I want and nothin' else will do  
This year for Christmas, I just want to be with you  
  
This year for Christmas, I just want to be with you  

Sometimes I can't put up with bein' so put down  
And all my faith can manage, is the shadow of a frown  
My soul's about to break, there's only one escape  
  
I look at you, when the world is full of lies  
I look at you, and the truth is in your eyes  
I look at you, when I lay me down at night  
And I want to see a dream come true  
I look at you, and I know I've got it all  
You touch my hand, and the burdens start to fall  
You ease my troubled mind, I love you more each time I look at you  
  
You know someday's I'm tempted to run away and hide  
'Cause I can't miss the bad luck that's fallen from the sky  
I'm under some dark cloud, and there's only one way out  
  
I look at you, when the world is full of lies  
I look at you, and the truth is in your eyes  
I look at you, when I lay me down at night  
And I want to see a dream come true  
I look at you, and I know I've got it all  
You touch my hand, and the burdens start to fall  
You ease my troubled mind, I love you more each time I look at you  
  
I look at you, and I know I've got it all  
You touch my hand, and the burdens start to fall  
You ease my troubled mind, I love you more each time I look at you

Yes, I know I'm late gettin' home tonight  
Can supper wait, I quess I lost my appetite  
Yeah you can fix me a drink, oh anything's okay  
Oh, by the way I met a friend of yours today  
  
I was workin' on the other side of town  
And comin' home I thought I'd stop and have a round  
And in this bar I heard someone speak your name  
And that's how I met a friend of yours today  
  
I listened for awhile and I could tell  
That that stranger there he knew you much to well  
And I introduced myself and you should have seen his face  
Oh what a shame I met a friend of yours today  
  
Please don't cry woman 'cause it's much too late for tears  
Yeah, I'm sorry too 'cause it hurts after all these years  
  
And ain't it sad a love like ours should end this way  
And all because I met a friend of yours today

Your out there somewhere and your crying  
And I love you though we've never met  
Wait there for me, I'll recognize you  
Someone lonesome, someone hurtin', someone blue  
That'll be you  
  
We'll help each other start all over  
A tear for a tear  
A shoulder for a shoulder  
You'll be someone that's born to lose  
'Cause I need someone like me  
To hold on too  
  
We'll help each other start all over  
A tear for a tear  
A shoulder for a shoulder  
You'll be someone that's born to lose  
'Cause I need someone like me  
To hold on too  
  
'Cause I need someone like me  
To hold on too

I just walked down the street to the coffee shop  
Had to take a break  
I'd been by her side for eighteen hours straight  
I saw a flower growing in the middle of the sidewalk  
Pushing up through the concrete  
Like it was planted right there for me to see  
The flashin' lights, the honkin' horns  
All seemed to fade away  
In the shadow of that hospital at 5:08  
I saw God today  
  
[Chorus]  
I've been to church  
I've read the book  
I know He's here, but I don't look  
Near as often as I should  
Yeah, I know I should  
His fingerprints are everywhere  
I'd just slow down to stop and stare  
Opened my eyes and man I swear  
I saw God today  
  
I saw a couple walking by they were holding hands  
Man, she had that glow  
Yeah I couldn't help but notice she was starting to show  
It stood there for a minute takin' the sky  
Lost in that sunset  
A splash of amber melted in the shades of red  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I got my face pressed up against the nursery glass  
She's sleeping like a rock  
My name on her wrist wearing tiny pink socks  
She's got my nose, she's got her mama's eyes  
My brand new baby girl  
She's a miracle  
I saw God today

I once had a love, a true and lasting love  
But the fool in me came out one night  
And with her loving eyes she saw right through my eyes  
And she changed the night I stepped across the line  
  
I should have watched that first step  
It was a mighty big step when I started steppin' out of line  
Though she's still lovin' me, it's not the way it used to be  
That first step did something to her mind  
  
I watched her slip away a little more every day  
And my conscience couldn't live with all that pain  
She's growing colder since the day I told her  
And the love we had will never be the same  
  
I should have watched that first step  
It was a mighty big step when I started steppin' out of line  
Though she's still lovin' me, it's not the way it used to be  
That first step did something to her mind  
That first step did something to her mind

Well, I do what my heart says do  
And right now it's pointing at you  
Hey girl, you're tuggin' on my heart strings  
Well, I've seen everything  
I thought I heard my heart sing  
  
I went home flying high  
I met the girl of my dreams tonight  
A wild fire, screamin' inside  
I know it's real 'cause my heart don't lie  
  
Well, I do what my heart says do  
And right now it's pointing at you  
Hey girl, you're tuggin' on my heart strings  
Well, I've seen everything  
I thought I heard my heart sing  
  
Well, here I am knocking on your door  
This old hound wants to talk a little more  
The T.V.A. and the hoover dam  
Don't turn me on like holding your hand  
  
I do what my heart says do  
And right now it's pointing at you  
Hey girl, you're tuggin' on my heart strings  
Well, I've seen everything  
I thought I heard my heart sing  
  
Well, I do what my heart says do  
And right now it's pointing at you  
Hey girl, you're tuggin' on my heart strings  
Well, I've seen everything  
I thought I heard my heart sing  
  
Well, I've seen everything  
I thought I heard my heart sing  
Well, I've seen everything  
I thought I heard my heart sing  
Heart sing  
Heart sing  
Heart sing

I said goodbye to you this mornin'  
With only these words to explain  
I said I'd found someone I love better  
But I still hear your voice call my name  
  
I thought I heard you callin' my name  
Funny, I still feel this way.  
Your voice seem so close, but I knew  
That by now you were many miles away  
  
I walk through the streets of the city  
People passing by think it's so strange  
I'm talkin' but there's no one beside me  
I thought I heard you call my name  
  
I thought I heard you callin' my name  
Funny I still feel this way  
Your voice seems so close but I knew  
That by now you're many miles away  
  
I thought I heard you callin' my name

I wasn't fooling around  
Everything's true that I said  
So take me seriously  
Darling, please just take me  
I wasn't fooling around  
  
Laugh if you want to  
But I wasn't joking  
About this love that's so real  
Is it surprising  
I'm romanticizing  
About the way I feel  
  
I wasn't playing around  
I'm not a kid anymore  
I'm not the clown  
That's just here to amuse you  
I wasn't fooling around  
  
Laugh if you want to  
But I wasn't joking  
About this love that's so real  
Is it surprising  
I'm romanticizing  
About the way I feel  
  
I wasn't fooling around  
It wasn't like that at all  
So take me seriously  
Darling, please just take me  
I wasn't fooling around  
I wasn't fooling around

You say you want to talk it over  
Want to try again  
But there's no way of workin' out  
This love that we're not in  
  
We could talk and talk and accomplish nothin'  
We've tried it all before  
It's time somebody did some walkin'  
And I can see the door  
  
So I'd just as soon go  
I'd just as soon say goodbye  
There's no reason to prolong  
What we should just let die  
  
And I'd just as soon stop  
I'd just as soon end the madness  
Knowin' what I know  
I'd just as soon go  
  
It's not an easy thing to do  
Leavin' seldom ever is  
But stayin' just to see us through  
Just ain't no way to live  
  
It's hard for you to understand  
But we're better off this way  
I can't fake it one more night  
Or take it one more day  
  
So I'd just as soon go  
I'd just as soon say goodbye  
There's no reason to prolong  
What we should just let die  
  
And I'd just as soon stop  
I'd just as soon end the madness  
Knowin' what I know  
I'd just as soon go  
Knowin' what I know  
I'd just as soon go

Heard somebody speak her name  
They said she was still looking fine  
I could feel that same old flame  
I once felt when she was mine  
Always thought that I was missing something  
But I found out much too late  
There'll never be another who loved me that way  
  
[Chorus]  
I'd like to have that one back  
I've never known someone so true  
And a love that's pure and sweet  
Is what a man should never lose  
And if my lips had said I'm sorry  
She might have stopped right in her tracks  
Now I find my poor heart saying  
I'd like to have that one back  
  
I can almost see her standing there  
Tears rolling down her face  
As she packed away her memories  
In that old worn out suit case  
If I'd only known then what I know now  
I'd never open that door  
Oh they just don't make hearts like her's any more  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I wouldn't here my poor heart saying  
I'd like to have that one back  
I wouldn't here my poor heart saying  
I'd like to have that one back

We both said some things I know we never meant,  
And when I slammed the door tonight you wondered where I went.  
If I know you, you're probably wonderin' what to do.  
You're thinkin' that I'm gone for good, if I know you.  
  
But if I know me, I'll turn this car around.  
I won't get halfway through town, and I'll be sorry.  
I'll stop and call, and you'll say you're sorry too,  
And I'll come runnin' back to you, if I know me.  
  
Sometimes I lose my head, say things to break your heart,  
Forgettin' if I lost your love, it would tear my world apart.  
If I know you, you didn't mean one single thing you said.  
Truth be known, you're dyin', cryin', lyin' there in bed.  
  
But if I know me, I'll turn this car around.  
I won't get halfway through town, and I'll be sorry.  
I'll stop and call, and you'll say you're sorry too,  
And I'll come runnin' back to you, if I know me.  
  
If I know me, and I know me.

If it's gonna rain I hope it pours  
Thunder and lightning  
Like never before  
'Cause that's how I feel  
Here in my heart  
If it's gonna rain  
Let the storm start  
  
If you're gonna leave go on and go  
Don't even look back  
When you hit the road  
If that's how you feel  
About you and me  
Now's a good time  
So go on and leave  
  
I've never been one for doing  
Something half the way  
I've loved you with all my heart  
But it's all been in vain  
  
It's gonna hurt  
Cut to the bone  
Break my heart in two  
When you move on  
I'm gonna cry a river of tears  
It's gonna rain and rain and rain  
'Round here for years  
  
I'm gonna cry a river of tears  
It's gonna rain  
Let the storm start  
If it's gonna rain I hope it pours

If the whole world was a honky-tonk,  
And it revolved around an old jukebox,  
We'd tell our troubles to the Bar,  
Over cryin' steel guitars,  
And soon, they'd all be gone.  
Yeah, if you asked me what I thought,  
I'd say: "We'd be better off,  
"If the whole world was a honky-tonk."  
  
You could smoke that cigarette,  
An' be politically incorrect.  
Show off that red 'round your neck:  
Not hear a single soul object.  
Wouldn't need no lawyers to decide,  
Who is wrong and who is right.  
No need for big expensive trials:  
Brother, we'd just step outside.  
  
If the whole world was a honky-tonk,  
And it revolved around an old jukebox,  
We'd tell our troubles to the Bar,  
Over cryin' steel guitars,  
And soon, they'd all be gone.  
Yeah, if you asked me what I thought,  
I'd say: "We'd be better off,  
"If the whole world was a honky-tonk."  
  
Wouldn't have to pay no tax:  
Just set a tip jar in the back.  
If we ran low, we'd pass the hat:  
I bet we'd all be in the black,  
If the whole world was a honky-tonk.  
  
And if you're lookin' love:  
Someone to heal that broken heart.  
Hey, buddy, you'd be in half.  
You wouldn't have to go that far.  
  
If the whole world was a honky-tonk,  
And it revolved around an old jukebox,  
We'd tell our troubles to the Bar,  
Over cryin' steel guitars,  
And soon, they'd all be gone.  
If you asked me what I thought,  
I'd say: "We'd be better off,  
"If the whole world was a honky-tonk."  
  
Life would be a three-chord song,  
And the king would be George Jones,  
If the whole world was a honky-tonk.

Would you like to live in Houston  
Where the cowboys come to town  
Or maybe Pensacola  
Where the sun shines all year ?round  
Or even New York City  
Where the city never sleeps  
I'm offering you the option  
Before you get in too deep  
  
If you can do anything else  
Baby, be good to yourself  
You can find a nice place, have a good life  
Don't worry ?bout me, I'm gonna be alright  
You can make a new start  
You can see yourself clear  
If you can do anything else, do it  
But if you can't  
Baby, you can stay right here  
  
There's work up in Seattle  
If you don't mind the rain  
San Diego to Savannah  
They'd all be glad you came  
But life with me would always be  
A roller coaster ride  
You won't hurt my feelings  
Whatever you decide  
  
If you can do anything else  
Baby, be good to yourself  
You can find a nice place, have a good life  
Don't worry ?bout me, I'm gonna be alright  
You can make a new start  
You can see yourself clear  
If you can do anything else, do it  
But if you can't  
Baby, you can stay right here  
  
This place might look real good right now  
But looking good don't last  
But if you choose it, anyhow  
I'll give you all I have (but)  
  
If you can do anything else  
Baby, be good to yourself  
You can find a nice place, have a good life  
Don't worry ?bout me, I'm gonna be alright  
You can make a new start  
You can see yourself clear  
If you can do anything else, do it  
But if you can't  
Baby, you can stay right here  

Lately you've been showin' all the signs  
Of a woman with someone else on her mind  
It's not your fault  
Some nights I've left you alone  
And if you're thinking you want a stranger  
There's one coming home  
  
Chorus:  
If you're thinking you want a stranger  
I'll soon be there  
You're gonna see a change in me  
This time I swear  
No more late nights  
Comin' in at daylight  
And no more doin' you wrong  
And if you're thinking you want a stranger  
There's one coming home  
  
Bought you a silk gown and perfume today  
Picked up some roses and champagne on the way  
Oh I called to ask you to put some soft music on  
Cause if you're thinking you want a stranger  
There's one coming home  
  
Chorus  
  
If you're thinking you want a stranger  
There's one coming home

You can turn me loose, tear me up and run me down  
Cause me shame, drag my name all over town  
Makes no difference what you say or what you do  
As for me I'll always be lovin' you  
  
[Chorus]  
My love for you was not built on shifting sands  
I made a promise long ago and it still stands  
Go on and do what your heart tells you to  
As for me I'll always be lovin' you  
  
You can change your dreams, change your heart  
Or change your mind  
And just pretend that it all ends with your goodbye  
You can walk out and forget the love we knew  
As for me I'll always be lovin' you

Leavin' me behind is all behind you now  
It's plain to see that you're for good over me  
You've gotta whole new life ahead of you  
You did what you lived to do  
And I'm all behind you now  
  
And I'll be behind you always  
Should you every be a yesterday  
Though it tears me up  
To know deep down  
I'm all behind you know  
  
You're comin' back  
My way will come my way again  
I'll never be what I was with you and me  
And I don't know who or where your goin' to  
But you did what you lived to do  
And I'm all behind you now  
  
And I'll be behind you always  
Should you every be a yesterday  
Though it tears me up  
To know deep down  
I'm all behind you know  
  
Yeah it tears me up to know deep down  
I'm all behind you know

Let's turn the lights down soft and low  
And watch the fire embers glow  
Let's lock the world outside the door  
This is the night we've been waiting for  
  
The moon is shining through the window pane  
I hear the echo of a passing train  
Taking someone's lover far away  
But in your arms is where I wanna stay  
  
Tonight I'm the luckiest man in the world  
Wrapped in the arms of a beautiful girl  
And now that I've found you  
I'm never gonna let you go  
  
Let your hair fall across your breast  
Show me the warmth of your soft caress  
The music's playin' soft and slow  
We're driftin' into the afterglow  
  
Tonight I'm the luckiest man in the world  
Wrapped in the arms of a beautiful girl  
And now that I've found you  
I'm never gonna let you go  
  
I'm never gonna let you go  
  
I'm never gonna let you go

Ain't love a strain  
Ain't it a pain in your heart  
Ain't worth the trouble anyhow  
I'd like to give it up  
I've had enough and I've done my part  
But I'm in too deep to pull out now  
  
Good things we've had are going bad  
And I don't know why  
I'd turn it around if I knew how  
I'm pushing aside all of my pride and it's worth a try  
'Cause I'm in too deep to pull out now  
  
[Chorus:]  
We need to get our love back on its feet again  
We've come to far to let it come to an end  
  
What can I do  
I'm in to you up over my heart  
And I've tried all that I know how  
Doing all I can  
I can't stand to see us fall apart  
And I'm in too deep to pull out now  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I can't step aside and let you  
Slide right out of my life  
It will cause more hurt than the law will allow  
I'll get us back on the track  
And it will be all right  
'Cause I'm in too deep to pull out now  
  
'Cause I'm in too deep to pull out now

Is it that time again?  
Closin' time closin' in  
Are they turnin' out the lights? Must I go home?  
'Cause her memory  
Is hauntingly  
Waiting there to see I'm not alone  
I know I just can't stand another lonely night  
This man is going out, out of his mind  
Since she left me behind  
Since she left me behind  
  
Am I the last one here?  
Please, just one more beer  
And I'll be on my way back to the blues  
Back down lonely street  
To a house that's peace  
I'm nothing but a line of bad news  
I know I just can't stand another lonely night  
This man is going out, out of his mind  
Since she left me behind  
Since she left me behind  
  
I know I just can't stand another lonely night  
This man is going out, out of his mind  
Since she left me behind  
Since she left me behind

I thought you and me were something special  
Thought you thought that way too  
Now I know that this old boy just ain't the  
Best you'll think you'll ever do  
  
[Chorus]  
It ain't cool to be crazy about you  
It ain't suave or debonair  
To let you know I care  
Like I do  
It ain't smart to be so reckless with my heart  
(I) Should've known right from the start  
I'd end up like a fool  
Believe me it ain't cool  
  
All of my friends they tried to tell me  
What and what not to do  
It took a while for them to sell me  
But finally they got through  
  
[Chorus]

Sun shines, clouds rain  
Train whistles blow and guitars play  
Preachers preach, farmers plow  
Wishes go up, and the world goes round  
  
And I love you  
It just come natural  
It just comes natural  
  
Seasons change, rivers wind  
Tumble weeds roll, and the stars shine  
Wind howls, dawn breaks  
Cowboys riding time slips away  
  
And I love you  
It just come natural  
It's what I was born to do  
Don't have to think it through  
Baby, it's so easy loving you  
It just come natural  
  
It's what I was born to do  
Don't have to think it through  
Baby, it's so easy loving you  
  
Fire burns, waves crash  
Seeds grow and good things last  
Ships sail, dreams fly  
Night falls and full moons rise  
  
And I love you  
It just come natural  
And I love you  
It just come natural  
It just come natural  
It just come natural

The first time I met her  
She walked right up to me and said you're who I've wanted to find.  
There was a man she had seen in her dreams and it was me.  
She said I can't believe it cause I've never been in here  
And I've passed this so many times.  
It was her night to find destiny and it was Me  
  
And we danced every song that they played, and talked until closing time  
The closer I held her, the more I knew her destiny wasn't that far from mine.  
Then I saw a reflection of someone unfamiliar looking back when I looked in
her eyes  
The happiest man I'd ever seen and it was me  
  
And we danced every song that they played and talked until closing time.  
The closer I held her, the more I knew her destiny wasn't that far from mine.  
She wasn't looking and I wasn't looking,  
Ain't it funny? Thats when love was found.  
She still calls it her lucky night,  
Yes someone was lucky she's right  
But it was me.  
It was me  
It was me

It's alright with me  
If it's alright with you  
It's alright I know  
Your love will see me through  
When the car won't start  
The rain won't stop  
And all of the bills are due  
It's alright with me  
If it's alright with you  
  
Well the boss man rides me all week long  
And it's all that I can take  
I work each day till' the sun is gone  
And no time for a break  
But when I get home you rub my back  
And tell me I'm your man  
With a little love I get back on track  
And do it all over again  
  
It's alright with me  
If it's alright with you  
It's alright I know  
Your love will see me through  
When the car won't start  
The rain won't stop  
And all of the bills are due  
It's alright with me  
If it's alright with you  
  
No matter what life throws at me  
I've got the upper hand  
'Cause nothin' else can set me free  
The way your lovin' can  
If I lived in the shack out in the woods  
And never see me blue  
I just throw another log in the old wood stove  
And make sweet love to you  
  
It's alright with me  
If it's alright with you  
It's alright I know  
Your love will see me through  
When the car won't start  
The rain won't stop  
And all of the bills are due  
It's alright with me  
If it's alright with you

Remember how lonely I told you it would be  
Without you here with me  
But you just turned and walked away  
And now that I've found somebody new  
You've changed your tune  
You want me back but all I can say  
  
[Chorus]  
It's too late now  
Just tell me how long did you think  
I'd be your fool  
And I would sit right here an' wait  
For you to make up  
Your mind to show up  
Well, just turn around  
I'm sorry it's too late now  
  
Well didn't I tell you that one of these days  
It would be too late  
To say you'd made a big mistake  
And now you've come back like you've never been gone  
Well baby you're wrong  
Somebody else has taken your place  
  
[Chorus]

So upset  
Nervous wreck  
I can't believe you said goodbye  
  
Sit and smoke  
Cry and joke  
About these tears in my eyes  
  
How could you do what you've gone and done to me  
I wouldn't treat a dog the way you treated me  
But that's what I get  
I've come to expect it from you  
  
A million times  
A million lines  
And I've bought 'em, every one  
  
You don't care  
You rip and tear  
Every dream I've counted on  
  
I guess that I should thank my unlucky stars  
That I'm alive and you're the way you are  
But that's what I get  
I've come to expect it from you  
  
How could you do what you've gone and done to me  
I wouldn't treat a dog the way you treated me  
But that's what I get  
I've come to expect it from you  
  
I could raise hell  
But what the hell  
It wouldn't do a bit a good  
  
Pack and leave  
My heart agrees  
It seems to think that I should  
  
There won't be no more next time doing me wrong  
You'll come back this time to find out that I'm gone  
But that's what you get  
You should expect that from me  
  
That's what I get  
I've come to expect it from you

The guys down at the job all want to know  
How things are going since I let you go  
I laugh and say my heart ain't missed a beat  
I've convinced everybody but me  
  
I'm all right, I'm okay,  
That's what I always say  
When they ask me how I'm doing without you  
I say I'm glad I'm free and if they all believe  
I've convinced everybody but me  
  
I'm the life of the party every night  
Nobody knows I'm dyin' deep inside  
I don't hurt at all as far as they can see  
I've convinced everybody but me  
  
I'm all right, I'm okay,  
That's what I always say  
When they ask me how I'm doing without you  
I say I'm glad I'm free and if they all believe  
I've convinced everybody but me  
  
I smile in every mirror  
Like I'm such a happy man  
But my heart knows what a liar I am  
  
I'm all right, I'm okay,  
That's what I always say  
When they ask me how I'm doing without you  
I say I'm glad I'm free and if they all believe  
I've convinced everybody but me  
  
Yes, I've convinced everybody but me

Well my baby's wearin' a permanent smile  
A satisfied look I ain't seen for awhile  
I ain't had no rings, fulfilled any dreams  
But somethin's come over my baby it seems  
  
I've got a funny feeling somebody's stealin' my honey  
Lord I love that child, love to see her smile  
But these circumstances ain't funny  
Where lies a danger, is he a stranger or a pal  
I've got a funny feeling somebody's stealing my gal  
  
If I came home early, lord what would I find?  
Maybe I'd rather just walk around blind  
I know baby loves me, lord I understand  
I love how emotions can get out of hand  
  
I've got a funny feeling somebody's stealin' my honey  
Lord I love that child, love to see her smile  
But these circumstances ain't funny  
Where lies a danger, is he a stranger or a pal  
I've got a funny feeling somebody's stealing my gal  
  
Wherever he is, well I'm callin' his bluff  
I'm gonna start wearin' that good smellin' stuff  
And I'll be the lover that I used to be  
Whatever she's missin', she'll get it from me  
  
I've got a funny feeling somebody's stealin' my honey  
Lord I love that child, love to see her smile  
But these circumstances ain't funny  
Where lies a danger, is he a stranger or a pal  
I've got a funny feeling somebody's stealing my gal  
  
I've got a funny feeling somebody's stealin' my gal

It's four am and you're just getting in.  
Your first night out- I won't ask where you've been.  
You're so ashamed and your eyes can't meet mine.  
I've seen that look on me a thousand times.  
  
Chorus:  
What makes us do the things we do heaven only knows.  
We think we've got a secret, but it always shows.  
I taught you how to cheat, you're doing fine.  
I've seen that look on me a thousand times.  
  
But I still love you and so I pretend  
And hope I never see that look again.  
But if I do I know the fault is mine.  
I've seen that look on me a thousand times.  
  
Repeat chorus:  
  
I've seen that look on me a thousand times.

Jingle bell, jingle bell  
Jingle bell rock  
Jingle bell swing  
And jingle bells ring  
Snowin' and blowin'  
Up bushels of fun  
Now the jingle hop has begun  
Jingle bell, jingle bell  
Jingle bell rock  
Jingle bells chime in  
Jingle bell time  
Dancin' and prancin'  
In jingle bell square  
In the frosty air  
What a bright time  
It's the right time  
To rock the night away  
Jingle bell, time  
Is a swell time  
To go glidin' in a  
one horse sleigh  
Giddy-up, jingle horse  
Pick up your feet  
Jingle around the clock  
Mix and mingle  
In a jinglin' beat  
That's the jingle bell  
That's the jingle bell  
That's the jingle bell rock

Joy to the world, the Lord is come  
Let earth receive her King  
Let every heart prepare Him room  
And heaven and nature sing  
And heaven and nature sing  
And heaven, and heaven and nature sing  
  
Joy to the earth, the Savior reigns  
Let men their songs employ  
While fields and floods, rocks, hills and plains  
Repeat the sounding joy  
Repeat the sounding joy  
Repeat, repeat the sounding joy  
  
No more let sins and sorrows grow  
Nor thorns infest the ground  
He comes to make His blessings flow  
Far as the curse is found  
Far as the curse is found  
Far as, far as the curse is found  
  
He rules the world with truth and grace  
And makes the nations prove  
The glories of His righteousness  
And wonders of His love  
And wonders of His love  
And wonders, wonders of His love  
And wonders, wonders of His love

I gave her that diamond she dreamed of,  
And I bought her a home with a view.  
I took her to the end of the rainbow,  
But all I left her was blue.  
Seems I never had time to love her,  
And now it seems time just stands still.  
  
I thought I was king of the mountain,  
But I was only a fool on the hill.  
  
Now I'm here alone, after leavin' her lonely  
Lord, I'm livin' with the memory I know I can't kill.  
I thought I was king of the mountain,  
  
But I was only a fool on the hill.  
Now I'm here alone, after leavin' her lonely  
  
Lord, I'm livin' with the memory I know I can't kill.  
I thought I was king of the mountain,  
But I was only a fool on the hill.  
  
Yeah, I thought I was king of the mountain,  
But I was only a fool on the hill.

Blues outside my door  
I don't even know if it's raining  
But I've been here before  
And I don't wanna be here again  
  
Ev'ry now and then  
voices on the wind  
call me back to the first time  
far away and clear  
you can hear the tear drops  
falling for the last in love.  
  
If I let you down  
All I can say is "I'm sorry"  
Now it's' all over town  
So I don't want to hear it from you  
  
Please don't look away it's hard enough to say  
This could go on forever  
When the night is clear  
I can hear the teardrops  
Falling for the last in love.  
  
Every now and then  
I hear voices on the wind  
I may love you always and always  
Far away and clear  
You can hear the teardrops  
Falling for the last in love  
Calling for the last in love  
  
  

I'm seeing you for the last time.  
You've been untrue for the last time.  
I know that you've been usin' me for a past time.  
It's the last time the first time for me.  
  
I found you and that love for the first time.  
When I caught you cheatin' me it was my worst time.  
  
I'm seein' you for the last time.  
I've been a fool for the last time.  
You only strung along with me for a past time.  
It's the last time the first time for me.  
  
I found you and that love for the first time.  
When I caught you cheatin' me it was my worst time.  
  
I'm seein' you for the last time.  
I've been a fool for the last time.  
You only strung along with me for a past time.  
It's the last time the first time,  
The first time it's the last time,

She said I don't recall  
Seeing you around here  
You must be new to this town  
Said, I'm just passin through  
But, girl from the looks of you I  
Could see me settling down  
  
The she smiled and said the invitations open  
Cause you look just like what I've been waiting on.  
So I said why don't we take  
This matter somewhere else  
And get to know this feeling that's so strong  
Lead on  
  
She said, I had a love once  
But he just up and left me  
I said I bet it broke your heart  
I had a love once to but  
I acted like a fool  
Oh what I'd give to be back in her arms  
  
Then she smiled and said the invitations open  
Cause you look just like what I've been waiting on.  
So I said why don't we take  
This matter somewhere else  
And pick up right where everything went wrong  
Lead on  
  
She said I don't recall  
Seeing you around here  
You must be new to this town

It's never over 'til it's really over  
And someone's left standing behind  
It goes without sayin'  
It's too late for stayin'  
And leavin's been comin' for a long, long time  
  
[Chorus:]  
I packed up my suitcase and started my pickup  
So many times in my mind  
It's a hard road to travel  
From blacktop to gravel  
And the next hill is the hardest to climb  
  
I've got all the answers for most of the questions  
And some ain't been easy to find  
There's no more erasin'  
The things I've been facin'  
And leavin's been comin' for a long, long time  
  
[Chorus:]  
And leavin's been comin' for a long, long time

A jukebox introduced us, when the sixties were still young.  
"If You've Got the Money, Honey" got my nickels one by one.  
I tried to imitate that song.  
It's not right, but Lefty's gone.  
  
"Always Late" breaks my heart.  
In every song he sang, I played the part.  
I heard he was sad, and lived alone.  
It's not right, but Lefty's gone.  
  
He played the fair in Dallas one year,  
In the cold October rain.  
Most folks stayed home and warm,  
But he sang just the same.  
I caught a chill before I got home.  
It's not right, but Lefty's gone.  
  
"Always Late" breaks my heart.  
In every song he sang, I played the part.  
I heard he was sad, and lived alone.  
It's not right, but Lefty's gone.  
  
It don't seem like he was around that long.  
It's not right, but Lefty's gone.

Oh the weather outside is frightful  
But the fire is so delightful  
And since we've no place to go  
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!  
  
It doesn't shows of stopping  
And I've brought some corn for popping  
  
The lights are turned way down low  
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!  
  
When we finally kiss goodnight  
How I'll hate going out in the storm!  
But if you'll really hold me tight  
All the way home I'll be warm  
  
The fire is slowly dying  
And, my dear, we're still goodbying  
But as long as you love me so  
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!

Pardon me, you left your tears on the jukebox  
And I'm afraid they got mixed up with mine  
I don't mean to pry, it's just that I  
Noticed you goin' out of your mind  
It looks like were two of a kind  
  
[Chorus]  
Let's fall to pieces together  
Why should we both fall apart  
Let's fall to pieces together  
Right here in each other's arms  
  
Alone is much better together  
When the worst is still yet to come  
So let's share the rest, of the tears that are left  
From two hearts that just came undone  
Why should we go crazy alone

Don't' need your love  
On a silver platter  
Let's get down tot he nitty grit  
Let's cut out all the chatter  
Get to the ehart of the matter  
Honey let's get down to it  
  
Let's get down to some huggin' and some squeezin'  
Arm and arm  
We'd be a perfect fit  
So put a freeze on the teasin'  
Let's get on with the pleasin'  
Honey let's get down to it  
  
I know that you want to  
I can see it when I look into those bug green eye's  
Baby let's come to grits  
Don't play so hard to get  
Honey let's get down to it  
  
I get a chill every time your near me  
You've got my heart doin' flips  
I only aim to please  
If you'd let go you'd see  
Honey let's get down to it  
  
I know that you want to  
I can see it when I look into those bug green eye's  
Baby let's come to grits  
Don't play so hard to get  
Honey let's get down to it  
  
Honey let's get down to it

Had a nice little life  
A little boat a little beach  
A little routine I liked  
A blue ocean view  
Free to go with the flow  
Anywhere that I wanted to  
But the moment you set foot on my shore  
That's when I knew  
  
There's a difference in  
Living and living well  
You can't have it all  
All by yourself  
Something's always missing  
'Til you share it with someone else  
There's a difference in living and living well  
  
'Til you smiled with me  
Thought that I had it good  
As good as it could be  
From the back of my deck  
Caught a fish caught a breeze  
And a thousand red sunsets  
But sitting here with you girl I just saw  
The best one yet  
  
There's a difference in  
Living and living well  
You can't have it all  
All by yourself  
Something's always missing  
'Til you share it with someone else  
There's a difference in living and living well  
  
My days are brighter  
My sky a deeper blue  
My nights are sweeter  
When I'm with you  
  
There's a difference in  
Living and living well  
You can't have it all  
All by yourself  
Something's always missing  
'Til you share it with someone else  
There's a difference in living and living well

At a truck stop in St Angelo  
Saw a bill board about this rodeo  
This weekend out in El Paso  
So I signed up to ride  
  
I drew a bull called "original sin"  
Heard he'd killed a couple of men  
Figured this was something I could win  
'Cause the devil was on my side  
I was havin' myself one hell of a ride  
But I ended up disqualified  
That bull just up and died  
Before they blew the whistle  
  
[Chorus]  
With those north Texas blues,  
Thought I'd paid all my dues  
Then those south Texas blues,  
Told me "son, you ain't through"  
Had the east Texas blues and the west Texas too  
I've done all I know to do,  
Tryin' to lose, tryin' to lose,  
These ol' Lone Star Blues.  
  
Well I got laid off at Brown and Rue  
Then on my way back to cuttin' chute  
I lost my wrist watch and my boots  
Shootin' dice with a dude from Houston  
Well there ain't no jobs here workin' cattle  
So I got on the part time haulin' gravel  
With some outfit from Seattle out here building custom homes  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well I gassed my truck and I packed my clothes  
Turned in my key and I hit the road  
I said "cow town's where I'll go,  
You never know, I might get lucky!"  
  
Well I got a friend there turning knobs  
At a place called Billy Bobs  
Said thought he could get me a job there  
Workin' as a bouncer  
First night on the job was just insane  
Some ol' boy got all deranged  
Hit me in the head with a Harley chain  
To this day, my ears still ring!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I've done all I know to do,  
Tryin' to lose, tryin' to lose  
These ol' Lone Star blues

I own this horse and saddle  
And that old Cadillac  
This broken down horse trailer  
And the clothes that are on my back  
Well I know that it ain't a hell of a lot  
But it's all that I can show  
  
My wife left me five years ago  
In one of those rodeo towns  
I can't say that I blame her much  
She just wanted to settle down  
Oh god how I miss that woman  
It hurt so to see her go  
If I was smart I woulda stuck by her  
But I'm hooked on this rodeo  
  
[Chorus]  
And I'm just a lonesome cowboy  
I'm a little bit over the hill  
I shoulda quit this thing a long time ago  
But I guess I never will  
So I keep on movin' from show to show  
Hopin' to change my luck  
My good ol' days are just a memory  
But I just can't give it up  
  
There was a time I used to do alright  
And bring home my share of the dough  
But now I'm losin' out to the younger boys  
I guess I must be gettin' slow  
But there's one thing you learn from this  
You gotta make it on your own  
Cause when your on top you've got a million friends  
But when your down buddy you're all alone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
My good ol days are just a memory  
But I just can't give it up

Those city lights drew you like a magnet  
You were attracted to his high-falootin' crowd  
I begged you not to go, but you still packed up  
I've been expectin' you  
Oh, look who's back from town  
  
My old truck could not compare to his Mercedes  
Did it humble you when you rode back on that Greyhound  
You picked a plastic rose and left a field of daisies  
I've been expectin' you  
Oh, look who's back from town  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
What brings you back to this part of the country  
Well let me guess, ol' loverboy let you down  
Did he throw you away like his money  
I've been expectin' you  
Oh, look who's back from town  
  
I've been expectin' you  
Oh, look who's back from town

When things get bad at home, you don't feel like being alone,  
And you find yourself inclined to look around.  
For the feelings we once shared are just no longer there,  
And love comes from the other side of town.  
  
Where love means just an hour with your stand in,  
And not an empty house where love just has been.  
Since everything we've built with love was not on solid ground,  
Now love comes from the other side of town.  
  
The life I'm livin' now just don't seem right somehow,  
But it's the best way to get by that I've found.  
There's no love left at home, we're both just hangin' on,  
And love comes from the other side of town.  
  
Where love means just an hour with your stand in,  
And not an empty house where love just has been.  
Since everything we've built with love was not on solid ground,  
Now love comes from the other side of town.  
  
Love comes from the other side of town

Love is everything  
It's a whole lot more than going to the store for a wedding ring  
It's kissin' and a huggin' but it's also the kicking and the cussing thing  
I've been told  
  
Love is everything  
It's a smile on your face on a cold winter day at the thought of spring  
It's getting up at night for the cry of a little bitty baby thing  
And it's growing old  
  
Love is everything  
It's those fires that daddy stoked those nights to keep you warm  
It's the hell your mama went through the day you were born  
And it's a thunderstorm  
  
Love is everything  
Oh, it's going off to war, it's the back and forth on a front porch swing  
It's the kiss that you got in the old parking lot of a Dairy Queen  
And it's you and me  
  
Love is everything  
It's looking out for everybody else but number one  
And it's all that really matters when all's said and done  
And the race is run  
  
Love is everything  
It's a rose on a stone, it's the words in a song that the choir sings  
It's the tears of goodbye and the place that you fly to, to get your wings  
Yeah love's the king  
Love is everything  
Love is everything

Well I was ruling the roost, had all the chicks to myself.  
And suddenly it happened, that funny little feeling I felt.  
Well I tried to outrun it, but it finally caught up with me.  
Tell me how can I run from something that I can't see?  
  
Oh that little bitty teeny weeny thing they call the lovebug.  
Nobody's ever seen it, but it's got the whole world shook up.  
It all started with a little bitty kiss and a hug.  
It's a little bitty teeny weeny thing they call the lovebug.  
  
Well I always thought that I had me a pretty good style,  
But I lost that race by a good old country mile.  
Well I was walking all around with my head held way up high,  
And it fooled me, hit me, really took me by surprise.  
  
Oh that little bitty teeny weeny thing they call the lovebug.  
Nobody's ever seen it, but it's got the whole world shook up.  
It all started with a little bitty kiss and a hug.  
  
Oh that little bitty teeny weeny thing they call the lovebug.  
Nobody's ever seen it, but it's got the whole world shook up.  
It all started with a little bitty kiss and a hug.  
It's a little bitty teeny weeny thing they call the lovebug.  
  
It's a little bitty teeny weeny thing they call the lovebug.  
Oh that little bitty teeny weeny thing they call the lovebug.  
Nobody's ever seen it, but it's got the whole world shook up.  
It all started with a little bitty kiss and a hug.  
It's a little bitty teeny weeny thing they call the lovebug.  
  
It's a little bitty teeny weeny thing they call the lovebug.

There's a secret that I know about the lady that I love so  
And I'm the only one she's shown her secret to  
She's gentle and she's kind  
She's proper and refine  
But she lets down more than her hair  
Alone in our room  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause she's more than a lady  
And there's a fire that burns behind those eyes  
She's more than a lady  
And every night when we lay down  
And she slips off her satin gown  
Oh, she proves she's a lover in disguise  
She's a lover in disguise  
  
When we go out somewhere  
The men may stop and stare  
But they see she's a lady  
So they leave her alone  
She's more than she seems  
And in their wildest dreams  
They could never dream of what it's like to take her home  
  
[Chorus]  
  
She's a lover in disguise  
She's a lover in disguise  
She's a lover in disguise

[chorus]  
Play me a dancer, a holder-hander, or honky-tonker,  
Pull-her-up-closer, slow romancer,  
Make her fall in love with me song.  
  
The room is swimmin' with pretty women,  
But how's a fella supposed to get close to 'em?  
The band is rockin', the joint is jumpin,  
Mr. guitar man let me tell you somethin'  
  
[chorus]  
  
I see a redhead, I see a brunette,  
And there's a blonde I love I don't even know yet.  
I'm going crazy, you got to save me.  
I need a hugger and I don't mean maybe.  
  
[chorus]  
  
Play me a dancer, a holder-hander, or honky-tonker,  
Pull-her-up-closer, get-next-to-her,sweet-enough-to-kiss-her,  
Just-a-little-softer-so-she-can-hear-me-whisper, slow romancer,  
Make her fall in love with me song.

We said goodbye in Marina del Rey  
"I had a good time"  
Was the last thing I heard her say  
As I walked away  
  
And on the plane back to Tennessee  
My mind comes across her memory  
And yesterday  
In Marina del Rey  
  
[Chorus]  
On a hidden beach under a golden sun  
She spread a blanket that we laid down on  
And loved the world away  
In Marina del Rey  
And as we looked into each others' eyes  
We were lost in paradise  
Like two castaways  
In Marina del Rey  
  
Like the ocean tide's highs and lows  
Love sometimes comes and goes away  
In Marina del Rey  
And as this plane is touchin' down  
Tears touch my eyes for I have found  
My heart has stayed  
In Marina del Rey  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We said goodbye  
In Marina del Ray

She sparkles, she dazzles, she lights up the room  
We walk together to a table for two  
Every man stares but her eyes are only for me  
We take to the dance floor, she squeezes my hand  
I can't believe just how lucky I am  
  
[Chorus]  
Meanwhile back in the back of my memory  
You're still dancing with me  
And I'm holding you once again  
Meanwhile  
  
We move to the end of a beautiful night  
Tender the kisses, soft candle light  
She draws the curtains, and slowly we climb up the stairs  
And reach for each other the passion begins  
We fall together as lovers and then,  
  
Meanwhile back in the back of my memory  
You're still lying with me  
And I'm holding you once again  
  
I try and I try, the Lord knows I do  
But each time my heart beats back to you  
  
Meanwhile I'll go on living my life now  
I'll find a way somehow  
Oh but, meanwhile back in the back of my memory  
You'll always be with me  
But I'll never hold you again  
Meanwhile.

It's Christmas time  
I see the lines of people everywhere tryin' to pick out the gifts  
That show how much they care  
It makes me wish that I could see my friends on Christmas Day  
And fill my list with lots of gifts but I can only say  
  
Here comes a merry Christmas strait to you  
I hope it cheers you up when you are down and feelin' blue  
Right or wrong I'll sing my song and you will know just who sings  
A merry Christmas strait to you  
  
There's lot of ways to share the days of Christmas with your friends  
A Christmas card, a tree that stars and gifts that make you grin  
I'd like to share this song with everyone who came our way  
Without a doubt the fires not out it burns for you today  
  
So here's a merry Christmas strait to you  
I hope it cheers you up when you are down and feeling blue  
You've been so kind you crossed my mind and nothing less will do  
Here's a merry Christmas strait to you  
  
Here comes a merry Christmas  
And to all who might have missed us  
A very, merry Christmas strait to you

I had no reason for shopping this season  
But I hung your stocking today  
It makes me feel better  
Though we're not together  
You'll always be in my heart  
Merry Christmas, wherever you are  
Since it was Christmas  
I thought you might call  
Or have you stopped thinkin' about me at all  
It'd be a perfect white Christmas  
A storybook picture  
If I could just share it with you  
Though you're not here with me  
I've got your memories  
They keep me goin' sweetheart  
Merry Christmas wherever you are  
Though you're not here with me  
I've got your memories  
You'll always be in my heart  
Merry Christmas wherever you are  
Tag:  
Merry Christmas wherever you are

Way out here you can see for miles  
If there was anything to be seen  
Maybe I could tell the difference between  
Where I am and where I've been  
So if I stare off in the distance sometimes  
And get that far away look in my eye  
It's that my baby went and left me out there  
All alone in the middle of nowhere  
Way out in the middle of nowhere  
Oh nobody wants to go there  
My baby's gone and she don't care  
That I'm out here in the middle of nowhere  
Standin' at the edge of the sky  
On top of a mountain so tall  
Wishin' to God I could fly, fly, fly  
When I ain't even done climbin' the wall  
Could you help me let the teardrops roll  
Awe anything to cleanse my soul  
Or if you've got a single raindrop to spare  
Lord I'm out in the middle of nowhere  
Way out in the middle of nowhere  
Oh nobody wants to go there  
My baby's gone and she don't care  
That I'm out here in the middle of nowhere  
My baby's gone and she just don't care  
That I'm out here in the middle of nowhere  
Yeah I'm out here in the middle of nowhere  
Yeah out here in the middle of nowhere  

Nobody saw him running from sixteenth avenue.  
They never found the fingerprint or the weapon that was used.  
But someone killed country music, cut out its heart and soul.  
They got away with murder down on music row.  
  
The almighty dollar and the lust for worldwide fame  
Slowly killed tradition and for that someone should hang  
(oh, you tell them Alan).  
They all say not guilty, but the evidence will show  
That murder was committed down on music row.  
  
For the steel guitars no longer cry and fiddles barely play,  
But drums and rock 'n roll guitars are mixed up in your face.  
Old Hank wouldn't have a chance on today's radio  
Since they committed murder down on music row.  
  
They thought no one would miss it, once it was dead and gone  
They said no one would buy them old drinking and cheating songs (I'll still
buy'em)  
Well there ain't no justice in it and the hard facts are cold  
Murder's been committed down on music row.  
  
Oh, the steel guitars no longer cry and you can't hear fiddles play  
With drums and rock 'n roll guitars mixed right up in your face  
Why, the Hag, he wouldn't have a chance on today's radio  
Since they committed murder down on music row  
Why, they even tell the Possum to pack up and go back home  
There's been an awful murder down on music row.

Well honey don't you worry I don't need no bar room queens  
Though I'll admit she sure knows how to fill a pair of jeans  
And I'll admit now darlin' she's sure showing me her stuff  
But honey it ain't nearly enough  
  
'Cause I ain't never seen her  
Patch a pair of raged britches  
Stretch a paycheck 'till it reaches  
Scratch my back right where it itches  
And I ain't never seen that and honey 'till I do  
My heart won't wander very far from you  
  
Now honey you know I honor all the hard times with been through  
I never could have made it with anyone but you  
And I think I know when a lady's really really tough  
And she don't show me nearly enough  
  
'Cause I ain't never seen her  
Stay up all night with a baby  
Calm me down when I get crazy  
Fix me grits and red-eye gravy  
And I ain't never seen that and honey 'till I do  
My heart won't wander very far from you  
  
No I ain't never seen her  
Make a six room house a castle  
Teach young'uns how to wrestle  
Straighten out my fishin' tackle  
I ain't never seen that and honey 'till I do  
My heart won't wander very far from you  
  
No I ain't never seen that and honey 'till I do  
My heart won't wander very far from you

When you see a shooting star in the night  
When you hear the warm wind whisper through the pines  
I want you to know  
  
[Chorus]  
It'll be me and my infinite love for you  
It's just like I promised you under heaven above  
It will live on long after we kiss goodbye  
Forever by your side  
My infinite love  
  
When you think someone is callin' out your name  
When you feel that kind of feelin' you can't explain  
Now you will know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I want you to know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
My infinite love  
My infinite love

Just a one pump fill-in station  
Lord and one old general store  
I found her in that wide spot  
In the road  
  
And the brightest lights she'd ever seen  
Were the headlights on my pickup  
Till she saw the lights behind  
Those swinging doors  
  
And everywhere she goes  
She leaves the jukebox smoking  
Everywhere she's been  
There's ashes on the ground  
  
I see the glow in the sky  
Through the teardrops in my eyes  
My old flame's out burnin'  
Another honky tonk down  
  
So country, young and pretty  
She's never been no where before  
And I lost her behind  
Those swinging doors  
  
Now it's just me and my old pickup  
Making every joint in town  
'Cause tonight she's out somewhere  
To burn one down  
  
And everywhere she goes  
She leaves the jukebox smoking  
Everywhere she's been  
There's ashes on the ground  
  
I see the glow in the sky  
Through the teardrops in my eyes  
My old flame's out burnin'  
Another honky tonk down  
  
My old flame's out burnin'  
Another honky tonk down

You're the only one and only  
My heart's beating for  
I love you, need I say more  
Now and ever, we'll be together  
Of that you can be sure  
I love you, need I say more  
  
I don't know just what it is  
That you're needing to hear me say  
The way that I'm feeling is more than mere words can describe  
All this discussion could never  
Do justice to something so heavenly-made  
I'd rather tell you  
With touches how I feel inside  
  
Let me hold you, let me show you  
What true love's all about  
In these arms of mine I know you will find  
You won't do without anymore  
I'll love you forever need I say more  
  
I don't know just what it is  
That you're needing to hear me say  
The way that I'm feeling is more than mere words can describe  
All this discussion could never  
Do justice to something so heavenly-made  
I'd rather tell you With touches how I feel inside  
  
Let me hold you, let me show you  
What true love's all about  
In these arms of mine I know you will find  
You won't do without anymore  
I'll love you forever need I say more  
I'll love you forever need I say more

You've been out again tonight  
With the girls out on the town  
But in those magic neon lights  
I know exactly what you found  
What about your home?  
And the man who loves you so  
Is it worth the thrill you feel down on neon row  
  
If you're lonely then your easy  
Them good ol' boys just pick and choose  
And lonely women are in season  
A one night stand's an all night lose  
And all those lonely high-heeled ladies  
Are always putting on a show  
But in the morning putting on coffee  
And putting back on the clothes they wore the night before  
To neon row  
  
Girl I can't hold you back  
Not one day longer  
If my love ain't strong enough  
To keep you home  
Just start the fire  
To burn the bridges  
And maybe some night will lead in the magic light  
Down on neon row  
  
If you're lonely then your easy  
Them good ol' boys just pick and choose  
And lonely women are in season  
A one night stand's an all night lose  
And all those lonely high-heeled ladies  
Are always putting on a show  
But in the morning putting on coffee  
And putting back on the clothes they wore the night before  
To neon row  
  
And putting back on the clothes they wore the night before  
To neon row

As the sun sets and you let go  
And my dreams go that way too  
And I watch the silhouettes flow out of clear view  
  
We can do this thing right  
Fix what went wrong  
Really make this work  
Turn around real slow  
Walk straight back to me  
Nobody has to get hurt  
  
We can learn from my mistakes now  
I don't ask you to forget  
But forgive my good intentions and where they went  
  
We can do this thing right  
Fix what went wrong  
Really make this work  
Turn around real slow  
Walk straight back to me  
Nobody has to get hurt

Leon Dixon leaves his Christmas lights up all year 'round  
It's somethin' different about our town  
We've often wondered why he never takes 'em down  
But Leon leaves his Christmas lights up all year 'round  
There's a big bright noel flashin' off and on  
In the yard where the children play the whole year long  
We've all gotten used to it year by year  
Now it's kinda gotten to be a part of things 'round here  
  
[Chorus]  
Peace on earth, Good will to men  
Christmas time is here again  
Can it be all that wrong  
To feel like Christmas all year long  
  
Leon got sick, it's been back awhile  
Short on luck and money, but he still wore that smile  
And nobody could stand to see him do without  
So we all drove over to see if we could help out  
Yeah, the noel flashed on and the bills stayed paid  
I felt so warm as we drove away  
I had never seen Christmas spelled so clear  
As when I saw ?LEON? flashin' in my rear view mirror  
  
[Chorus]

O Christmas tree  
Thy leaves are so unchanging  
Not only green when summer's here  
But also when 'tis cold and drear  
  
O Christmas tree  
Thy leaves are so unchanging  
O Christmas tree  
Much pleasure thou can't give me  
How often has the Christmas tree  
Afforded me the greatest glee  
  
O Christmas tree  
O Christmas tree  
How richly God has decked thee  
Thou bidst us true and faithful be  
And trust in God unchangingly.  
O Christmas tree

If you leave me  
I won't miss you  
And I won't ever take you back  
Girl your memory  
Won't ever haunt me  
Cause I don't love you  
Now if you'll buy that  
  
[Chorus]  
I got some ocean front property in Arizona  
From my front porch you can see the sea  
I got some ocean front property in Arizona  
If you'll buy that I'll throw the golden gate in free  
  
I don't worship  
The ground you walk on  
I never have and that's a fact  
I won't follow or try to find you  
Cause I don't love you  
Now if you'll buy that  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Yeah if you'll buy that I'll throw the golden gate in free

Last night I had a dream, dreamt I had it all I had it all  
I had one truck, one car  
One boat, one guitar  
But all these things wouldn't get me too far  
If I didn't have one of you  
  
I work hard every day to bring home all my pay  
I got one house, one yard  
One dog who likes to bark  
We'd be cold, living the dark if I didn't have one of you  
  
One of you is all I want and all I'll ever need  
One of you is all it takes to make my life complete  
  
[Chorus]  
This is what I have, you have it all  
I got one heart, one love  
One dream I'm dreaming of  
Wouldn't have known what to give it all to  
If I didn't have one of you  
  
One of you is all I want and all I'll ever need  
One of you is all it takes to make my life complete  
  
[Chorus]

I couldn't help but over hear your conversation  
When you told her that you owned her heart and soul  
You say you've got her wrapped around your finger  
But there's somthin' bout angels you should know  
  
She'll walk away one step at a time  
It'll take you by surprise  
You'll think it happened over night  
It'll be too late when you realize  
Angels don't fly  
They just walk away one step at a time  
  
Don't think that I'm tryin' to mind your business  
It's a full time job just tryin' to mind mine  
But I once had an angel just like her  
And if I'd treated her right  
She'd still be by my side  
  
She'll walk away one step at a time  
It'll take you by surprise  
You'll think it happened over night  
It'll be too late when you realize  
Angels don't fly  
They just walk away one step at a time  
  
It'll be too late when you realize angels don't fly  
They just walk away one step at a time

Lady I know your out there somewhere  
Like me your feeling lost  
Maybe right now we both need each other  
But our paths may never cross  
  
People like us never find each other  
Love is our greatest loss  
Baby I know you are out there some where  
But our paths may never cross  
  
We're to people that should be together  
'Cause we're lonely at the very same time  
But there's a million to many good reasons  
Why your love can never be mine  
  
Maybe this song was written for you  
Listen, don't turn it off  
I wish you could learn it  
And come sing it with me  
But our paths may never cross  
  
I wish you could learn it  
And come sing it with me  
But our paths may never cross

Let me be your male-man  
And I'll always come though  
There's no denying'  
Come rain or shine  
I'll deliver my love to you  
I do things by the letter  
You can put your stamp on me  
Cause there ain't nobody better  
For a special delivery  
  
[Chorus]  
Like the pony express  
And the wild wild West  
I'll ride hard all night long  
And I can saddle up fast  
Get ya there first class  
Long before the dawn  
You know your male's gonna get to you  
Come snow, rain, sleet, or hail  
'Cause I'm a top flight, hold ya tight, get ya there by daylight  
Do you right overnight male  
  
I know your heart is fragile  
So I'll handle it with care  
There ain't no doubt  
I know love's route  
So baby let me take you there  
I'll bring you cards and flowers  
But I know just what you need  
Just give me 24 hours  
Satisfaction guaranteed  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You know your male's gonna get to you  
Come snow, rain, sleet, or hail  
'Cause I'm a top flight, hold ya tight, get ya there by daylight  
Do ya right overnight male  
Yeah I'm a top flight, hold ya tight, get ya there by daylight  
Do ya right overnight male
