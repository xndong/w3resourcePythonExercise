I've been so many places  
In my life and time  
I've sung a lot of songs  
I made some bad rhymes  
  
I've acted out my life in stages  
Ten thousand people watching  
But we're alone now  
I'm singing this song for you  
  
I know your image of me  
Is what I hope to be  
I treated you unkindly  
But, darling, can't you see  
There's no one more important to me?  
Oh, baby, can't you, please, see through me?  
'Cause we're alone now, and  
I'm singing this song for you  
  
You taught me precious secrets  
Of the truth, withholding nothing  
You came out in front, I was hiding  
Oh, but now I'm so much better  
If the words don't come together  
Just listen to the melody  
'Cause my love's in there hiding  
Oh, oh  
  
Oh, I love you in a place  
Where there's no space or time  
Love you for my life  
You are a friend of mine  
And when my life is over  
Remember when we were together  
We were alone and  
I was singing this song for you  
We were alone  
I was singing this song for you, oh  
Singing  
I was singing, singing, singing, singing, singing this song for you  
Oh, yes  
Singing this song for you

Into my life  
You brought a glowing love  
Like a ray of sunshine  
From up above  
One day out of a clear blue sky  
You darkened my life with your words "goodbye"  
That's the day you left me for a stranger  
Don't you know that when you left my life  
Took on a change-a?  
  
Now I'm telling you it  
Ain't no sun since you've been gone  
  
There's a big black cloud hanging over my head  
Cloud of loneliness I feel like I'm dead  
Ain't no flowers blooming round here for sure  
Since you chose to love me no more  
I guess you know you took my sunshine away from me baby, boy  
You took the life from my world  
Crushed my dreams  
And I don't mean maybe, baby, baby  
And it ain't no sun since you've been gone  
  
Oh, my future, my future  
Was as bright as the sun, yes it was  
I ain't got no future since you've been gone  
  
I guess you know you took my sunshine away from me baby, yes you did  
You took the life from my world  
Crushed my dreams  
And I don't mean maybe, baby, baby  
It seems like night in the middle of the day  
Everything around me is faded and grey  
Cold are the days  
Dark creeps the night  
Never bringing you back into my life  
It ain't no sun since you've been gone  
  
You took my sunshine away, yeah ooh, ooh, ooh  
You took my sunshine away, yes you did, ooh, ooh, ooh  
You took my sunshine away, yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh  
You took my sunshine away, oh

If all you want's a good time, baby  
There's a party down the street  
If you're trying to fight an old flame  
Well, I can't take the heat  
If you're looking for a game to play  
Well, I wish you luck  
'Cause all I have to offer you is love  
  
If you only want a keeper darling  
I don't hold the key  
If you're searching for a savior better  
Get down on your knees  
If you're looking for the answers, well  
Hell I don't know that much  
'Cause all I have to offer you is love  
  
Oh darling, there's a whole lot of things  
I've found that I just can't be, no I can't  
But if you're looking for a real love, baby  
I've got all that you'll ever need  
It might be more than you're after  
Or not nearly enough  
But all I have to offer you is love  
  
Oh darling, there's a whole lot of things  
I've found I just can't be  
But if you're looking for a real love, baby  
I've got all that you'll ever need  
It might be more than you're after  
Or not nearly enough, ahh  
But all I have to offer you is love  
  
Sweet love, baby  
'Cause all I got to offer you is love  
Sweet love  
Oh baby, sugar

I tried so hard  
All summer through  
Not to think too much of you  
But the more I try  
The more I find  
I just can't leave the past behind  
  
Times that are happy  
Are times that are few  
And once I was happy  
When I had you  
  
But days have come and gone  
Since you were here  
Nights are twice as long  
Without you near  
Pictures on my mind  
Stand out so clear  
No matter where I am  
Or what I do  
My darling  
All I see is you  
  
You're there in every dream  
I ever dream  
There at every place  
I've ever been  
Everyday I find  
You're in my heart  
And on my mind  
I close my eyes  
But I'm not blind  
I see you still  
And when I throw my arms out wide  
I find that you're not by my side  
But one thing is for sure  
Until I do  
All I see is you  
  
Everyday I find  
You're in my heart  
And on my mind  
I close my eyes  
But I'm not blind  
I see you still, oh  
  
I won't live again  
'Til I'm with you  
Oh, darling  
I won't love again  
Unless it's with you  
  
So until the day  
When you are back with me to stay  
In every way  
All I see is you

Mmm, my friends keep telling me to pull myself together  
They try to cheer my up but it's not gettin' better  
They say that time will pass and I'll love again some day  
But time is standing still ever since you went away  
  
Now, all the king's horses and all the king's men  
You'll never get me back together again  
'Cause I just fall apart each time I look at you  
No, all the king's and all the king's men  
Are never gonna make me smile again  
How can I smile just knowin' you're with somebody new?, ooh  
  
You had my hopes so high I guess they had to tumble  
And when you left my dream my world began to crumble  
No woman ever found the only missing part  
When you left me behind don't you know you took my heart?  
  
Now, all the king's horses and all the king's men  
You'll never get me back together again  
'Cause I just fall apart each time I look at you, yes I do, now  
All the king's and all the king's men  
You're never gonna make me smile again  
How can I smile just knowin' you're with somebody new?, ooh, yeah, ooh, ahh,
ha  
  
All the king's horses and all the king's men  
You'll never get me back together again  
'Cause I just fall apart each time I look at you, yes I do  
I said, all the king's and all the king's men  
Are never gonna make me smile again  
How can I smile just knowing you're with somebody new?, yeah  
  
All the king's horses and all the king's men  
You'll never get me back together again  
And I just fall apart each time

Why don't you stop  
And look me over?  
Am I the same girl  
You used to know?  
Why don't you stop  
And think it over?  
Am I the same girl  
Whom you hurt so?  
  
I'm the one you want  
And I'm the one you need  
I'm the one you love  
The one you used to meet  
Around the corner everyday  
We would meet and slip away  
But we were much too young  
To love each other this way  
  
Am I the same girl?  
Yes I am, yes I am  
Am I the same girl?  
Yes I am, yes I am  
  
Why don't you stop  
And look me over?  
Am I the same girl  
You used to know?  
Why don't you stop  
And think it over?  
Am I the same girl  
Whom you hurt so?  
  
I'm the one you hurt  
And I'm the one you need  
I'm the one who cried  
The one you used to need  
But you are pretending you don't care  
But the fire, ahh, is still there  
But we are no longer too young  
To love each other this way  
  
Am I the same girl?  
Yes I am, yes I am  
Am I the same girl?  
Yes I am, yes I am  
Oh, yes I am  
  
Am I the same girl?  
(Yes I am, yes I am)  
Am I the same girl?, yeah  
(Yes I am, yes I am)  
Oh, yes I am  
Am I the same girl?  
(Yes I am, yes I am)  
Oh, baby, yes I am

What is this strange elation?  
Taking my train of thought to an unknown destination  
And suddenly I don't know where I am  
But like a tremor or a spark  
Something's happening in my heart  
  
I've been arrested by you  
Take me in, oh, oh, oh  
Finally captured by you, by you and by you  
Take me in  
I've been arrested by you  
Take me in, oh, oh, oh  
Finally captured by you, by you and by you  
Take me in  
  
You've broken my concentration  
Saving me just in time from a desperate situation  
And suddenly, I don't know who I am  
But my dilemma's where to start  
Something's happening in my heart  
  
I've been arrested by you  
Take me in, oh, oh, oh  
Finally captured by you, by you and by you  
Take me in  
I've been arrested by you  
Take me in, oh, oh, oh  
Finally captured by you, by you and by you  
Take me in  
  
I've been arrested by you  
Take me in, oh, oh, oh  
Finally captured by you, by you and by you  
Take me in  
I've been arrested by you  
Take me in, oh  
Finally captured by you, oh, oh  
Take me in  
I've been captured, captured, captured, captured  
Oh, baby  
Oh, ho,  
Take me baby  
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Show me that smile again  
Oh, show me that smile  
Don't waste another minute on your cryin'  
We're nowhere near the end  
We're nowhere near  
The best is ready to begin  
  
All in a cloudy daze  
I look into your eyes and see them shining out  
Holding you close this way  
Holding you this way  
Is like having summer everyday  
Ooh, ooh  
  
As long as we got each other  
We got the world spinnin' right in our hands  
Baby, you and me  
We gotta be  
The luckiest dreamers who never quit dreamin'  
  
As long as we keep on givin'  
We can take anything that comes our way  
Baby, rain or shine  
All the time  
We got each other  
Sharin' the laughter and love  
  
Promise me here and now  
Nothing but jokes  
Will never come between us  
You can depend on me  
'Cause I need you like the air I breathe  
Oh, oh  
  
As long as we got each other  
We got the world spinnin' right in our hands  
Baby, you and me  
We gotta be  
The luckiest dreamers who never quit dreamin'  
  
As long as we keep on givin'  
We can take anything that comes our way  
Baby, rain or shine  
All the time  
We got each other  
Sharin' the laughter and love  
  
As long as we got each other  
We got the world spinnin' right in our hands  
Baby, you and me  
We gotta be  
The luckiest dreamers who never quit dreamin'  
  
As long as we keep on givin'  
We can take anything that comes our way  
Oh, baby, rain or shine  
All the time  
We got each other  
Sharin' the laughter and love

(Ooh, ooh, baby blue)  
(What's wrong with you?)  
Ooh, yeah  
Getting back to business, baby  
Just believe in me  
Forget the things the wise men say  
That's our philosophy  
  
(I want you now)  
I've got the feeling you want me, too  
(Show you how)  
Oh, oh  
Gonna catch a shaft of light  
Shine it in your eyes  
Gonna see what's on your mind  
Before you realise  
  
(I want you now)  
I've got the feeling you want me, too  
(Show you how)  
Ooh, hoo  
  
(Ooh, baby blue)  
(What's wrong with you?)  
You got me worn out trying  
(Ooh, baby blue)  
(What can I do?)  
Why don't you let me through to you?, oh, yeah, oh  
  
If I follow my desire  
Come inside your heart  
It would be impossible  
To stop what we might start  
  
(I want you now)  
I've got the feeling you want me, too  
(Show you how), so  
  
(Ooh, baby blue)  
(What's wrong with you?)  
You got me worn out trying  
(Ooh, baby blue)  
(What can I do?)  
Why don't you let me through to you?  
  
(Ooh, ooh, baby blue)  
(What's wrong with you, baby blue?)  
(Ooh, ooh, baby blue)  
What can I do?  
  
If I follow my desire  
Come inside your heart  
It would be impossible  
To stop what we might start

Oh, baby blue  
(What's wrong with you?)  
You got me worn out trying  
(Ooh, baby blue)  
(What can I do?)  
Oh, baby blue

(Baby don't you know?)  
Tonight you'll take away my sorrow  
(Baby don't you know?)  
That it will all come back tomorrow  
When we have to part  
(Why, oh why)  
Do I go on loving you?  
  
(Baby don't you know?)  
How much I want my arms about you?  
(Baby don't you know?)  
This emptiness I feel without you  
Close to my heart  
(Close to my heart)  
  
Don't ever, ever say goodbye  
(Say goodbye)  
Unless you wanna see, wanna see me cry  
  
(Baby don't you know?)  
That we were meant to be together  
(Baby don't you know?)  
The thought of leaving you forever  
Tears me apart  
(Tears me apart)  
  
I'll never say goodbye to you  
(Say goodbye to you)  
Unless you really want, really want me to  
(Baby don't you know?)  
I wanna spend my life loving you  
  
(Close to my heart)  
Don't ever, ever say goodbye  
(Don't say goodbye)  
Unless you wanna see, wanna see me cry  
  
(Baby don't you know?)  
That we were meant to be together  
(Baby don't you know?)  
The thought of leaving you forever  
Tears me apart  
(Tears me apart)  
  
I'll never say goodbye to you  
(Say goodbye to you)  
Unless you really want, really want me to  
(Baby don't you know?)  
I wanna spend my life loving you  
  
(Baby don't you know?)  
Wanna spend my life loving you  
(Baby don't you know?)  
(Baby don't you know?)  
I wanna spend my life  
(Baby don't you know?)  
(Baby don't you know?)

I can tell by lookin' in your eyes, yea man  
There is something on your mind  
Restless so long  
It's time to let you go  
There's a dream out there  
I know you got to find  
So, if you take the love that I will give to you  
Then I won't feel like I'm losin' you  
  
I want you to be somebody, be somebody, be somebody  
I know you can be somebody  
Be somebody strong  
To me, you'll always be somebody, be somebody, be somebody  
You'll never do wrong  
Never do wrong  
Always be strong, strong, oh  
Be strong, yeah  
  
People change  
It happens all the time  
Still, it hurts to say goodbye  
So, if my tears are gettin' in your way  
I'm imagining how your wings learn to fly  
So, shine your light for all the world to see  
Share the love you feel  
But save the best for me  
  
I want you to be somebody, be somebody, be somebody  
I know you can be somebody  
Be somebody strong  
To me, you'll always be somebody  
Ooh, you can be somebody  
You'll never do wrong  
Always be strong  
  
If you need me you can count on me  
I know, I know  
You can be somebody, ooh  
You can be somebody  
I know you can be somebody  
Ooh, somebody strong  
In my heart you'll always be somebody, oh  
You can be somebody  
I know it, I know it, I know it  
Oh, you'll never do wrong  
You can fly, you can fly, oh, fly

I wonder where you are, lovable lady  
I wonder what you're thinking, beautiful woman  
It seems like fog is settling in within your eyes  
And the weight of something is pulling your shoulders down  
  
Could it be you ask too much, lovable lady?  
From a world that's out of touch, beautiful woman  
So you're hammering at a door that will not open  
And your beautiful soul is weeping  
  
Better learn the way it goes  
Oh, better share the pain that shows  
You wanna transcend it in order to end it  
But your loneliness grows  
  
Ah, ha, do you hate yourself, lovable lady?  
Can I be of help, beautiful woman?  
Your silence is a wall between the two of us  
And my beautiful soul is weeping  
Oooooooooooh

Out of nowhere into sight  
Out of darkness into light  
You come running pushing time  
Out of reason  
Out of rhyme  
Bits and pieces of your past  
Cling like shadows to your heels  
And your heart is learning fast  
How it feels  
  
With your secrets in your eyes  
And your feelings in disguise  
You come running in your fright  
Seeking shelter from the night  
And you search each passing face  
For a sign someone could care  
But they rush by in their race  
To nowhere  
  
And you watch and wonder where you belong  
And the crowd, it moves and takes you along  
And the colors splash and repaint your sky  
And reality is yours to deny  
And you look for someone your arms can hold  
Who will let you tell what begs to be told  
Then you ask yourself what good are your dreams?  
In a world where nothing is what it seems  
  
Bits and pieces of your past  
Chill your soul like winter rain  
But the time will come at last  
When a love will ease your pain  
If you let me I will try  
If you let me I'll be near  
If you let me when you cry  
I will hear  
  
Oh, oh and you watch and wonder where you belong  
And the crowd, it moves and takes you along  
And the colors splash and repaint your sky  
And reality is yours to deny  
And you look for someone your arms can hold  
Who will let you tell what begs to be told  
And you ask yourself what good are your dreams?  
In a world where nothing is what it seems  
  
And you watch and wonder where you belong  
And the crowd, it moves and takes you along  
And the colors splash and repaint your sky  
And reality is yours to deny  
And you look for someone that your arms can hold  
Who will let you

Hey! Just stop your domination  
You can't move on my personality  
Unconcerned, you use manipulation  
Shamelessly  
  
Well, you know you've got ??an?? education  
It simply fails to satisfy my needs  
It's a fool's game  
Nobody's gonna rule me  
  
Oh, those blind sheep  
Lead 'em to the slaughter  
Blind sheep  
Mothers, hide your daughters  
Love's cheap  
Look at the smile on their faces  
Oh, ho  
Blind, leadin' the blind, leading the blind  
  
Hey, hey, hey  
I'm tired of suffocation  
Oh, but for talk  
You never follow through  
What I want is some hot and hard persuasion  
Endlessly  
  
It's so sad, the sleazy innuendos  
They've brought so many victims to their knees  
Chain reaction  
Half-assed satisfaction  
  
You've got me but a blind sheep  
Lead 'em to the slaughter  
Blind sheep  
Mothers, hide your daughters  
Love's cheap  
Look at the smile on their faces  
Ooh, ooh, ooh  
Blind, leading the blind, leading the blind  
  
Deprivation just don't work on me  
Even affliction, it just don't do it  
All I want is  
What I need is  
(Blind sheep)  
  
It's not fashion to you  
You're just malicious  
Don't get trying  
Simply not judicious  
  
All I want is  
What I need is  
(Blind sheep)  
  
Such a city, something exotic  
You autocrat  
I'm simply not turned onto that  
  
All I want is  
What I need is  
(Blind sheep)  
  
???debility???  
I'm by the side of the station

(tom springfield)  
  
The springfields  
  
Breakaway, my heart is cryin'  
Breakaway, the time is flyin'  
So, I'm gonna tell myself don't sit and mourn  
Lookin' sad and so forlorn  
Tell myself I'm glad I'm born  
Well, I'm gonna breakaway  
  
Breakaway, the breeze is sighin'  
Breakaway, the time is flyin'  
So, I'm gonna pack a bag and get my coat  
Lock my door and leave a note  
Take a train or take a boat  
Well, I'm gonna breakaway  
  
I'll take me round from town to town  
I'll see the friends I knew  
I left 'em by the wayside  
But I know their hearts are true  
  
I'll give myself a holiday  
I need it oh-so bad  
And if I find a new love  
I'll be glad, glad, glad  
  
Breakaway, my heart is cryin'  
Breakaway, the time is flyin'  
So, I'm gonna find out what this world can give  
While I'm young I'm gonna live  
That's my plan, I'm positive  
Well, I'm gonna breakaway  
  
I'll take me round from town to town  
I'll see the friends I knew  
I left 'em by the wayside  
But, I know their hearts are true  
  
I'll give myself a holiday  
I need it oh-so bad  
And if I find a new love  
I'll be glad, glad, glad  
  
Breakaway, my heart is cryin'  
Breakaway, the time is flyin'  
So, I'm gonna find out what this world can give  
While I'm young I'm gonna live  
That's my plan, I'm positive  
Well, I'm gonna breakaway  
Gonna breakaway  
Gonna breakaway  
Breakaway  
Breakaway

You've been cryin'  
Your face is a mess  
Come in baby  
You can dry the tears on my dress  
She's hurt you again  
I can tell  
Oh, I know that look so well  
  
Don't be shy  
You've been here before  
Pull your shoes off, lie down  
And I will lock the door  
  
And no-one has to know  
You've come here again  
Darling it will be  
Like it's always been before  
Come on over here  
  
Breakfast in bed  
And a kiss or three  
You don't have to say you love me  
Breakfast in bed  
Nothing need be said  
Ain't no need  
  
What's your hurry?  
Please don't eat and run  
You can let her wait, my darling  
It's been so long  
Since I've had you here  
You will come again  
Darling it will be  
Like it's always been before  
Hey child  
  
Breakfast in bed  
And a kiss or three  
You don't have to say you love me  
Breakfast in bed  
Nothing need be said  
  
Breakfast in bed  
And a kiss or three  
You don't have to say you love me  
Breakfast in bed  
Nothing need be said, yeah  
You don't have to

If we fuss and we fight  
Why do we have to do it every Saturday night?  
We can act for our friends  
But why can't we face each other when the masquerade ends?  
Well now, I don't know what's happening  
I can't tell just who's to blame  
But two forgiving people  
Could be so in love again  
  
Stop! We're breakin' up a happy home  
Oh darlin'  
Stop! 'Cause I never was much good alone  
Sweet baby  
Oh, don't turn your back and walk away  
Don't do it, no  
Stop! We're breakin' up a happy home, yeah  
  
It's a game no-one wins  
Trying to hurt each other with those needles and pins  
I can't go back, can't go on  
But somehow I know the feeling isn't totally gone  
Oh, there's so much love between us  
That we're so afraid to show  
It's been keeping us together  
But for how long, I don't know  
  
Stop! Yeah, we're breakin' up a happy home  
Oh darlin'  
Stop! I never was much good alone  
Listen baby  
Ooh, don't, no, turn your back and walk away  
Don't do it, oh stop  
Stop! We're breakin' up a happy home, yeah  
  
Ooh  
Stop! Stop! Don't break it up  
Stop! Stop! Don't break it up  
Gotta be another way we can try  
Stop! Stop! Don't break it up  
Stop! Stop! Don't break it up  
I don't want to hear you saying goodbye  
Oh baby, sweet baby, ahh, yeah baby, ooh baby

Oh, bring him back  
If he's too much for you  
And you don't know just what to do  
Just send him right on back to me  
'Cause I'm still the fool I used to be  
  
If it's only just for a day  
I'll take him back any old kinda way  
I ain't fooling anymore  
Been crying since he walked out the door  
  
Don't know what to do  
Don't know where to go  
You know I love him so  
You know so won't you  
(bring him back), mmm  
(Bring him back)  
You know you gotta bring him back  
(Bring him back), ooh, yeah  
(Bring him back), mmm  
Just bring him back to me  
  
(I want you to bring him back)  
(I want you to bring him back)  
(I want you to bring him back)  
  
Oh, bring him back to me  
My life is full of misery  
Let me play with the boy  
Let me be his little toy  
  
Oh, bring him back to me  
My life is full of misery  
You know you gotta bring him back  
Ah, ha, you've gotta bring him back  
Oh, bring him back to me  
Oh, my life is full of misery

I walk where once the grass was green  
And mourn the lark that sings no more  
What bird could sing whose eyes have seen  
Broken blossoms on the field of war?  
  
And as they lie there in the sun  
How unimportant now it seems  
Just who has lost and who has won  
When with them have died so many dreams  
  
They dreamed that endless hate would end  
Unceasing fear, one day, would cease  
They dreamed that foe would turn to friend  
And eternal war would turn to peace  
  
But who can say how many more  
Will join these young and hopeful men?  
In fields they've never seen before  
Far from fields they'll never see again

(Peter Allen)  
  
We'll go away  
Make love all day  
You'll never stay  
But it's a nice dream  
  
Just me for you  
Our whole life through  
It won't come true  
But it's a nice dream  
  
Such a nice dream  
So, kiss me goodbye  
I'm sorry that it went so fast  
Our future has become our past  
Too good we couldn't last  
Oh, and now we see  
With you and me  
One's gotta let go  
But it's a nice dream  
Oh, baby, such a nice dream  
  
So, kiss me goodbye  
I'm sorry that it went so fast  
Our future has become our past  
Too good we couldn't last  
Mmm, and now we see  
With you and me  
One's gotta let go  
And let the other go free  
Aah, in love we'll still be  
Oh, it proves it was real  
It was a real nice dream

Your secret's safe inside me  
Closet man  
Safe under lock and key  
Understand  
What you're thinkin' is important  
Isn't really so, you'll see  
But your secret's absolutely safe with me  
Your lover's songs and nights  
Turn into tears  
Your tattoos and your muscles  
Disappear  
And the ring that I once gave you  
Now, you're wearin' in your ear  
But your secret's absolutely safe my dear  
Oh, your secret's safe with me  
Oh, your secret's safe right here with me  
Oh, your secret's safe with me  
Oh, your secret's safe right here with me  
You know, it's all right to go on and live your life  
So, come out into the light  
Closet man  
There's nothing new at all under the sun  
You've got company  
You're not the only one  
Why, it's older than religion  
And, quite honestly, more fun  
But your secret's absolutely safe my dear, don't worry  
Oh, your secret's safe with me  
Oh, your secret's safe right here with me  
Oh, your secret's safe with me  
Oh, your secret's safe right here with me  
You know, it's all right to go on and live your life  
So, come out into the light  
Closet man, yeah  
You know, it's all right to go on and live your life  
So, come out into the light  
Closet man  
You know, it's all right to go on and live your life  
So, come out into the light  
Closet man  

Come for a dream  
Come and love in the sun  
Come and stay  
Just as long as you may  
Sunny love for a day  
Sunny love may not stay  
  
Love may be glowing fantasy  
Young love is free  
Come for a smile  
Making love in the sun  
Like kaleidoscope rainbow begun  
  
Sunny love making fun  
Sunny love making one  
Magic sensation in the sun  
Come for a while  
Run away from sorrow  
Run away tomorrow  
One special day  
Warm and dazzling  
We climb a tree  
Making love in the sea  
Sunny love come and be  
Sunny love you and me  
  
Imagination is the key  
Sing me away, mmm  
  
Run away from longing  
Run into belonging  
Come for a dream  
Come and love in the sun  
Come and stay just as long as you may  
Sunny love for a day  
Sunny love may not stay  
Love may be glowing fantasy  
Young love is free  
Mmm, da, da, dumb, da, da, mmm, da, da, dumb, da, da

(tom springfield)  
  
The springfields  
  
Don't stand there wailing " got no place to go"  
Come on home  
You look at me like that and I can't say no  
Come on home  
  
Well, I know you done me wrong  
And I know I should be strong  
But, I cried the whole night long  
So, come on home  
Come on home  
  
Tell me baby, must you be so cruel?  
Come on home  
You treat me just like I'm some kind of fool  
Come on home  
  
Well, I know you let me down  
I was glad when you left town  
But, you're good to have around  
So, come on home  
  
Don't run away now  
Come on home  
You got your way now  
Come on home  
A-hear what I say now  
Come on home  
Come on home  
  
When you smile at me well I feel so good  
Come on home  
I can't be mad at you like I know I should  
Come on home  
Well you took me for a ride  
And I thought my love had died  
Still I need you by my side  
So come on home  
Come on home  
Come on home  
Come on home  
Come on home  
Come on home  
  
Yeah, when you smile at me well I feel so good  
Come on home  
I can't be mad at you a-like I know I should  
Come on home  
Well, you took me for a ride  
And I thought my love had died  
Still, I need you by my side  
So, come on home  
Said yes  
Come on home  
Sit down  
Come on home  
Come on home

Ooh, hoo  
Get up in the morning  
'Bout a quarter to nine  
Get home in the evenin'  
Too tired to make time  
Give me the lovin'  
I've been waiting for all day  
You're always a little too tired  
To ever look my way  
  
You got me hungry for your love  
But you, you ain't able  
All you want to give me  
Is the crumbs off the table  
What you been doin'?  
Who you been wooin'?  
Tell me, tell me who you been doin'?  
  
I ache inside  
With a lovin' desire  
But you're too tired, baby  
To light my fire  
I work in this house all day  
And I get tired too  
There ain't a day goes by  
I ain't willing to make love to you  
  
I'm hungry for your love  
But you, you ain't able  
All you want to give me  
Is the crumbs off the table, ah  
What you been doin'?  
Who you been wooin'?  
Tell me, tell me, tell me who you been doin'?  
  
Hey, sometimes in the middle of the day  
I get lovin' you on my mind  
But as soon as you get home  
You read the paper  
Ain't got the time  
  
What you been doin'?  
Who you been wooin'?  
Tell me, tell me, who you been doin'?  
What you been doin'?  
Who you been wooin'?  
Tell me, tell me, tell me who you been doin'?  
  
I said I'm hungry for your lovin'  
But you, you ain't able  
All you want to give me is the crumbs off the table  
Hungry for your love  
But you

(You gotta wake up)  
You don't commit to me  
You won't make a start  
You don't tell me no  
You haven't got the heart  
You sit in a chair  
Or you lie in bed  
With a faraway stare  
And a swollen head  
  
Well, listen here my lover  
I have had enough  
And I can tell you brother  
I could fall in love  
With someone who  
Looks a lot like you  
But gets up and does  
What he's thinking of  
  
I can't wait another day  
I can give and I can take  
There's a choice you have to make  
  
So many times things pass you by  
Imagination running wild  
You've got to start choosing right from wrong  
Instead of daydreaming all day long  
  
I want to catch a plane  
To an open space  
I want to feel the sun  
Shining on my face  
But time is short  
And waiting is long  
And my patience is exhausted  
I'm just not that strong  
  
I want to see the parade  
You want to watch TV  
So we don't do either  
It's insanity  
You say there's plenty of time  
And life is good  
So you never make your mind up  
Well you never could  
  
I can ask you when or why  
And you'll look up to the sky  
The parade is marching by  
  
So many times things pass you by  
Imagination running wild  
You've got to start choosing right from wrong  
Instead of daydreaming all day long  
Daydreaming, oh, oh, daydreaming, daydreaming  
  
You gotta wake up, you gotta wake up  
(Leave me alone I'm only dreaming)  
You gotta wake up, you gotta wake up  
(Leave me alone I'm only dreaming)  
You gotta wake up, you gotta wake up  
(I'm only dreaming), oh, oh  
  
I can't wait another day  
I can give and I can take  
There's a choice you have to make, oh, oh  
  
So many times things pass you by  
Imagination running wild  
You've got to start choosing right from wrong  
Instead of daydreaming all day long  
  
So many times things pass you by  
Imagination running wild  
You've gotta choose right from wrong  
Instead of daydreaming all night long  
  
(Daydreaming)  
So many times  
(Daydreaming)  
Things pass you by  
(Daydreaming)  
You've gotta choose right from wrong  
(Daydreaming)  
All day long  
All day long

I love the dear heart, and gentle people  
Who live in my home town.  
Because the dear heart and gentle people will never, ever let you down.  
They read the good book from Friday till Monday.  
That's how the weekends go.  
I have a dream house I'll build there someday  
With picket fence and rambling rose.  
[Bridge:]  
I feel so welcome, each time that I return.  
My heart swells up just like a cloud.  
I love the dear heart and gentle people, who live and love in

(Earl King)  
  
Do re me fa so la ti  
This little creature was a-passing me  
He got a whole lot of rhythm when he walks  
And I can hear music, baby, when he talks  
Do re mi fa so la ti  
Forget about the dough and think about me, oh yeah  
  
Do re mi fa so la ti  
I wonder who can this creature be?  
He ain't no picture as I can see  
But I don't care he looks so good to me  
Do re mi fa so la ti  
Forget about the dough and think about me  
  
Do re mi fa so la ti  
I'd like to love you, yeah, yes sir'ree  
It may sound crazy but it's a fact  
Hey tell me, baby, baby  
How you gonna act?  
  
Do re mi fa so la ti  
Forget about the dough and think about me  
Oh yeah  
  
Do re mi fa so la ti  
Let's get together and make whoopee  
A b c d e f g  
Cupid's shootin' arrows straight by me  
  
Do re mi fa so la ti  
Forget about the dough and think about me  
A b c d e f g  
The cat's in the cupboard and you can't catch me  
A b c d e f g  
Forget about the dough and think about me  
A b c d e f g  
Cupid's shootin' arrows straight by me  
Oh, yes

Nobody believes that I really care for you  
They don't think my heart is true  
I don't think you agree  
You know I'm a lifetime guarantee  
So, if they ask you what you mean to me  
  
Don't call it love  
Heavens above  
We got a better thing, mmm  
Don't call it love  
That ain't enough  
Just tell them you're my everything  
  
Nobody believes we got something they ain't got  
They've never seen a fire this hot  
They never got that far  
Burning as bright as any star  
So, if they asked you what your feelings are  
  
Don't call it love  
Heavens above  
We got a better thing  
So, don't call it love  
That ain't enough  
Just tell them you're my everything  
  
Feels so good  
Holding tight  
Through the night  
Ah, but they can call it what they like  
But they ain't got it right, no, no, no  
  
So, don't call it love  
Heaven's above  
We got a better thing  
  
Don't call it love  
That ain't enough  
Just tell them you're my everything, baby, please  
  
Don't call it love  
Heaven's above  
We got a better thing, yes we do, baby  
  
Don't call it love  
Heaven's above  
We got a better thing  
  
Don't call it love  
That ain't enough  
Ooh, ooh  
Don't call it love, ooh, ooh  
Got a better thing

If I lose this dream  
I don't know what I'm gonna do  
If I lose this dream  
I'm dreaming about for me and you  
  
If it goes away  
I might as well hang it up  
'Cause I don't know  
If I have the heart or mind  
To make it true  
Or help it grow  
And I only know, I only know, I only know  
  
If I lose this dream  
It's goodbye love and happiness, yes  
You're the one I need  
I don't want a love  
That's second best  
There've been all of my life  
I wanted to do  
That made me blue  
  
Help me hold onto this dream  
For sometimes dreams often come true  
And they all come true, they all come true  
For me and you  
Wait a minute baby  
  
Don't let me lose this dream  
Baby, baby hold on  
Don't let me lose my dream, no  
Baby, baby be strong  
  
You say that a-you believe that what I say is true  
And that I'm the one and only girl for you  
Just tell me  
That no matter what the people say  
You're in my corner all the way  
And I won't lose this dream  
Baby, baby hold on  
Don't let me lose my dream, no  
Baby, baby be strong  
  
Don't let me lose this dream  
Baby, baby hold on  
Don't let me lose, lose my dream  
Baby, baby hold on  
Don't let me, ooh baby

(Don't say it, baby)  
(Don't say it, baby)  
Don't say it, baby  
Don't say it's only me for you  
It's not true  
I'm still young, and there's so much I want to do  
(Don't say it, baby)  
(Don't say it, baby)  
  
Don't say it, baby  
Don't say the word that you'll regret  
Don't forget  
I'm a girl who's learned to take what she can get  
(Don't say it, baby)  
  
Today I could never belong to one boy  
(One boy)  
And while you wait for tomorrow  
You'll find your heart broken in two  
  
Don't say it, baby  
Don't be a fool for anyone  
Have your fun  
Go away  
Live every day while you're young  
(Don't say it, baby)  
  
Go away  
Live every day while you're still young  
(Don't say it, baby)  
You better go away while you're still young  
You gotta live every day now  
While you're still young

Life never seems to get you down  
You always seem so full of fun  
Never feel alone  
Don't need anyone  
I always have to think of you  
I need to know how much you care  
Wonder where you are  
I always need you here  
Don't say you care  
If you are going to hurt me  
Don't tell me lies  
'Cause I can see they're not true  
Don't say you'll stay  
If you are going to leave me  
Don't speak of love  
'Cause you know I'll always love you  
You think I'd make your life my own  
You think I'd stop you being free  
Try to tie you down  
And make you stay with me  
I only want you as you are  
I'd never stop you being you  
Don't want you to change  
All I want is you  
Don't say you care  
If you are going to hurt me  
Don't tell me lies  
'Cause I can see they're not true  
Don't say you'll stay if you  
If you are going to leave me  
Don't speak of love  
'Cause I know I'll always love you  
Don't say you'll care  
If you are going to hurt me  

Yeah  
Don't you know, baby?  
Hey child, don't you know?  
Don't you know, baby?  
Little boy, little boy, don't you know?  
Don't you know, baby?  
Boy, I'm in love with you so  
  
Turn your oil lamp down low  
I said, turn your lamp down low  
Ow, turn it down  
Yeah, turn your lamp down low  
A-come on, baby  
I know I'm in love with you so  
  
I know I've been away  
For such a long, long time  
But now, baby, I can't get you off my mind  
So come on, baby, come on  
Now come on, I love you daddy all night long  
  
Ow, now you love me like I love you  
We can do all the things that we used to do  
So come on, a-come on  
Hey, a-come on, I love you daddy all night long  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Ooh, singin' it baby, yeah  
  
Hey, have you heard?  
My guy's back in town  
You can mess around 'til the midnight hour  
To see what he's puttin' down  
So, come on, oh baby, come on  
A-come on, I love you daddy all night long  
  
A-turn your lamp down low  
A-turn your lamp down low

Turn that thing down, baby  
I love you daddy all night long

Drop me off in Harlem  
Any place in Harlem  
There's someone waiting there  
Who makes it seem like Heaven up in Harlem  
  
I don't want your Dixie  
You can keep your Dixie  
There's no one down in Dixie  
Who can take me 'way from my hot Harlem  
  
Harlem has those southern skies  
They're in my baby's smile  
I idolize my baby's eyes  
And classy up-town style  
  
If Harlem moved to China  
I know of nothing finer  
Than to stow away on a 'plane some day  
And have them drop me off in Harlem

I surround myself with superficial things  
Somethin' to toy with  
They don't mean a thing  
I got my share of secrets  
A long time overdue  
I got a world inside me  
I'd better keep on running to  
  
I dream on

Now, my friends all say I'm crazy  
And I'm blowing every chance  
'Til until I hear your sweet, sweet music  
Nothin's gonna make me dance  
'Cause I'm a dreamer and my eyes give me away  
Oh, they're always sayin'  
All the things I'd never say

Trees that grow without ground  
Young leaves that fall in spring  
Ground hogs tell me play games  
My games would reel the world  
Ring around the pine tree  
Smile a game around the sunsweep  
Cry a game across the moonbeam  
Across the earthbound gypsy  
Flowers build a green wall  
Blue flowers bloom in sand  
People tell me play games  
My games would reel the world  
Ring around the seaweed  
Ring your name around the sunsweep  
Cry your name across the moonbeam  
Tell the earthbound gypsy  
Play your gypsy game in my world  
Give your magic word to the people  
Who live in the underground world without sun  
In the world without moonbeams  
The village down deep without  
Purple leaves that seem red  
Grape vines that smile in fall  
Zebras tell me play games  
My games would spill the world  
Ring around the bean tree  
Jump a game around the sunsweep, moonbeam  
Magic earthbound gypsy  
Jump the fence  
Play your gypsy game in my world  
Give your magic word to the people  
Who live in the underground world without sun  
In the world without moonbeams  
The village down deep without

Hah!  

Well you are  
Such an easy evil  
You're such a sensuous sin  
Sometimes I don't know where I'm goin'  
'Til I been taken in  
  
You're such an easy evil  
Such a promise of fun  
Sometimes I don't know what I'm doin'  
'Til I'm done, you're a sneaky one  
  
Here he comes now touchin' me  
Callin' my name  
Again  
Here I go now  
Like a moth to a flame  
I'm a puppet for you baby  
  
Such an easy evil  
You're such a sensuous sin  
Sometimes I don't know where I'm goin'  
'Til I been taken in, yeah  
  
Ooh, ooh, yeah, ooh, oh  
Here he comes now touchin' me  
Callin' my name  
Again  
Here I go now  
Like a moth to a flame  
I'm a puppet for you baby  
  
Such an easy evil  
You're such a sensuous sin  
Sometimes I don't know where I'm goin'  
'Til I been taken in  
  
Well, no, no, no, no, no, no  
No, no, no, no, no, no, no  
'Til I been taken in  
I been taken in  
I been taken in

I'll put your pictures all around my wall  
I'll build a tower of love that won't fall  
I'll do everything I can  
I'll try to be your own lovin' woman  
With every ounce of strength I have  
Oh, yeah  
  
Oh, there is nothing that I wouldn't do  
To let the world know  
I'm crazy 'bout you  
  
I'd use all of my woman's power  
To keep you happy for a million hours  
Every ounce of strength I have  
Every ounce of strength I have  
  
You can ask for what you want  
And a-get what you ask  
I'd give my all to make  
I would love for ever last  
With every ounce of strength I have  
Oh, yeah  
  
Long as blood runs through my veins  
Long as I can see clouds that bring on rain  
I'll use a-all of my woman's power  
To keep you happy for a million hours  
  
With every ounce of strength I have  
Every ounce of strength I have  
I'm gonna keep you happy  
With every, every, every, every ounce of strength I have  
Every ounce  
I'm gonna keep you happy  
With every, every, every

Everyday I have to cry some  
Everyday I have to cry some  
Dry the water from my eyes some  
Everyday I have to cry  
  
There was a little boy I had planned to marry  
This was my love I didn't want to share it  
I thought that love would make my life bright and sunny  
He said he couldn't love me 'cause he didn't have no money  
  
So, everyday I have to cry some  
Everyday I have to cry some  
Dry the water from my eyes some  
Everyday I have to cry  
  
I got me a boy  
I guess I really loved him  
Every night now I was thinking of him  
But you can't mix love with money  
'cause if you do it's gonna hurt somebody  
  
So, everyday I have to cry some  
Everyday I have to cry some  
Dry the water from my eyes some  
Everyday I have to cry  
  
Although I know that he's just a poor boy  
Is it wrong to love 'cause he's not a rich boy?  
Every time you mix love with money  
Every time you hurt somebody  
  
So, everyday I have to cry some  
Everyday I have to cry some  
Dry the water from my eyes some  
Everyday I have to cry  
  
Everyday I have to cry  
Everyday I have to cry  
Oh, oh

This is a song written exclusively for me  
Something to warm me on a lonely Winter's night  
And if I want to think someone's thinking of me  
I look into my song, see who I can see  
  
My pace is curlin', hurlin' now, from key to key  
Written through the gloom  
Of a lonely empty room  
All the lines start to unlock my mind and I feel free  
The Winter's night gives way to a warm Summer's day, yeah, yeah  
  
The light's turned off, but there's nobody to turn on  
And there's no happiness in having to undress  
I put such thoughts aside and listen to my song  
Now, it makes things better  
My song does the rest, yeah  
  
This is a song written exclusively for me  
Something to warm me on a lonely winters night  
And if I want to think of someone's thinking of me  
I look into my song and see who I can see

I never knew how good love could be  
All I'd ever known was make believe  
So many times Ive played the fool  
Baby, til I met you  
Now everything has fallen in place  
You can tell by the smile on my face  
For every lonely tear that Ive cried  
I'm that much satisfied  
  
We've got a fine, fine, very fine love  
We've got a fine, fine, very fine love  
You know it when you find one  
Shining like a diamond  
  
Its so fine, fine, very fine love  
How did I ever live without your love?  
Its the only thing I'm certain of  
No matter what I'm going through  
I know I can count on you  
  
You are more precious to me every day  
Life is better now in every way  
You don't have to lay the world at my feet  
You have made my world complete  
  
We've got a fine, fine, very fine love, oh, oh  
We've got a fine, fine, very fine love  
You know it when you find one  
Shining like a diamond  
Its so fine, so fine, very fine love  
  
Ive got no apprehensions  
You've got the best intentions  
We've got a, we've got a, we've got a fine, fine, very fine love  
We've got a fine, fine, very fine love  
A very fine  
A very fine love  
Very fine love, ah, ha, ooh, hoo  
So fine, hey, so fine  
So good, so good love

Isn't it time all of love's bad debts got paid?  
Don't be afraid  
Isn't it true?  
If you don't trust in yourself  
You'll trust no-one else  
All your favorite memories  
Are not your worst enemies  
Come on, give 'em a ride  
You gotta decide to push them aside  
Give it a try  
  
You gotta get yourself to love  
She's not the only one  
You, you gotta get yourself to love  
Why be the lonely one?  
Get yourself to love  
  
Take away the things you need to start again  
Your heart will never mend  
Take away, oh, the chance you have to slip and fall  
You will miss it all  
  
Drop your one-part harmonies  
For the harder melodies  
You're so aware  
Of the crosses you bear  
Don't be so scared  
Show that you care  
  
Oh, you, oh, you gotta get yourself to love  
She's not the only one  
Oh, you, yes you, you gotta get yourself to love  
Why be the lonely one?  
  
Oh, you, yeah, you gotta get yourself to love  
Yes, love, you gotta love sometime  
You, oh, you  
Why be the sad and lonely one?  
You know  
You can do it, yes, you can do it, you can do it for yourself  
Yes, you can, oh, don't bend  
You can do it, you can do it, you can do it  
You can do it for yourself

If you'll only give me time  
All the heartache that he left behind  
Will fade from my mind  
I'll be free to love again  
  
If you'll only give me time  
I'll forget I even knew his name  
Forget that he came  
I'll be no good till I can  
Try to understand  
But when I'm sure I need him no more  
That's when I'll reach out for your hand  
  
So darling give me time  
And you will see that i'm  
Ready to love you  
Just as you love me  
Wait awhile  
'til I can find my smile  
And I'll be yours for as long as I live  
If you'll only give me time, yeah  
  
So darling give me time  
And you will see that i'm  
Ready to love you  
Just as you love me, oh  
Wait awhile  
'til I can find my smile  
And I'll be yours for as long as I live  
If you'll only give me time

If you're gonna break my heart  
Go ahead on  
Guess you think you're kinda smart  
Go ahead on  
(Well you've got another girl)  
And you're having fun  
(Got her head in a whirl)  
See what you've done  
Go ahead on  
(Go ahead on)  
I said go ahead on  
(Go ahead on)  
  
You never call me on the 'phone  
Make me so sad  
Sittin' all alone  
Feelin' bad  
(Tired of being your fool)  
'Cause you told me lies  
(I can't take no more)  
Of no alibi  
Go ahead on  
(Go ahead on)  
Go ahead on  
(Go ahead on)  
  
For a little while  
We had a good thing goin'  
Everything was peaches and cream  
But the devil in you started showin'  
Do you understand now  
What I mean?  
  
You put me down  
Every night  
If you want to be a clown  
That's all right  
(When it's all too late)  
Then you'll see  
(She's done the same to you)  
Like you did it to me  
Go ahead on  
(Go ahead on)  
Go ahead on  
(Go ahead on)  
  
You put me down  
Every night  
If you want to be a clown  
That's all right  
(When it's all too late)  
Baby you'll see  
(She's done the same to you)  
Like you did it to me  
Go ahead on  
(Go ahead on)  
Go ahead on  
(Go ahead on)  
  
Git, git, git  
(Go ahead on)  
Go ahead on  
(Go ahead on)  
You'd better pack your bag  
(Go ahead on)  
Go ahead on  
(Go ahead on)  
Bye, bye, bye  
(Go ahead on)  
Go ahead on

hear you baby, I know how you feel  
We're both hungry for something that's real  
Be honest with me or don't even try  
'Cause I can't afford another goodbye  
  
Go easy on me, baby, not too rough  
If this is right, there's no need to rush  
Oh, go easy on me, if you don't mind  
'Cause I can't afford to lose another time  
  
Starting over isn't easy as it sounds  
When you try to make the pieces fit  
They all fall down  
And I need more than someone to hold on to  
I need a love that's tried and true  
It's what I'm searching for  
It's worth waiting for  
  
Talk gently to me, nice and low  
If you mean it, baby, my heart will know  
Oh, go easy on me, like walking on ice  
'Cause forever happens once not twice  
  
Starting over isn't easy as it sounds  
When you try to make the pieces fit  
They all fall down  
And I need more than someone to hold on to  
I need a love that's tried and true  
It's what I'm looking for  
It's worth waiting for  
  
Go easy on me, baby, not too rough  
If this is right, we'll know soon enough  
Oh, go easy on me, not too fast  
I gotta believe that what's between us  
Can be more than just a promise  
'Cause they don't last  
So all that I ask  
Go easy on me  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  
Easy, ooh, ooh, ooh

I think I'm goin' back  
To the things I learned so well in my youth,  
I think I'm returning to  
The days when I was young enough to know the truth  
  
Now there are no games  
To only pass the time  
No more coloring books,  
No Christmas bells to chime  
But thinking young and growing older is no sin  
And I can play the game of life to win  
  
I can recall a time,  
When I wasn't afraid to reach out to a friend  
And now I think I've got  
A lot more than a skipping rope to lift  
  
Now there's more to do  
Than watch my sailboat glide  
Then everyday can be my magic carpet ride  
And I can play hide and seek with my fears,  
And live my life instead of counting my years  
  
Let everyone debate the true reality,  
I'd rather see the world the way it used to be  
A little bit of freedom, all we're left  
So catch me if you can  
I'm goin' back  
  
I can recall,  
I can remember  
  
I can recall,  
I can remember  
  
I can recall,  
I can remember

Who d'you think you're kidding?  
You walk out on my life  
Now, you're back again  
And you think that nothing's changed  
Denying superstitions, defying traditions  
It seems like we've been through this before  
Now, it's gonna be like starting all over again  
Oh, baby, don't you know?  
It's gonna be like starting all over again  
I gotta get used to you  
I gotta get used to you, again  
I gotta get used to you  
I got to get used to you, again  
You know I love to feel you  
Reach the depth of my heart  
Deep inside of me  
The way it used to do  
I've had so many lovers  
No-one could ever tame me  
They all seem to rub me the wrong way  
They always get my back up  
No-one seems to do the things that you do for me  
And now that you're back in my life again  
I gotta get used to you  
I gotta get used to you, again  
I gotta get used to you  
I got to get used to you, again  
I gotta get used to you  
I gotta get used to you, again  
I gotta get used to you  
I got to get used to you, again  
I gotta get used to you  
I gotta get used to you, again  
I gotta get used to you  
I got to get used to you, again  
I gotta get used to you  
I gotta get used to you, again  
I gotta get used to you  
I got to get used to you, again  
I gotta get used to you  
I gotta get used to you, again  
I gotta get used to you  
I got to get used to you, again  
I gotta get used to you  
I gotta get used to you, again  
I gotta get used to you  
I got to get used to you, again  

(Guess who?)  
Where's the girl who hurt herself last night?  
(Guess who?)  
Didn't kiss you and thought she was right  
Everyone had told me  
Be careful when he holds me  
And I was  
  
(Guess who?)  
Had to listen to all that she hears  
(Guess who?)  
Has a pillow that's all wet with tears  
You were oh-so tender  
But I wouldn't surrender  
Now you're gone  
  
I told my friends "He'll never get my heart"  
And when I kissed you  
Had to resist you  
Said "Better go"  
I hurt you so  
  
Wished you had stayed  
But I made you go away  
(Guess who?)  
Tried to be much too cool yesterday  
(Guess who?)  
Let the boy that she loves get away  
I never should have listened  
'Cause now your love I'm missin'  
It's too late  
Woah, it's too late, ahh, ha  
  
I never should have listened  
'Cause now your love I'm missin'  
It's too late  
Oh, it's too late  
Ah, oh, ah, ah, oh  
It's too late, mmm

Ooh, hoo  
I can't eat right  
I can't sleep nights  
Oh, honey look at what you've done to me  
Life is nowhere  
And it's no fair  
'Cause you've got me by the memory  
  
Oh, now I feel you near me  
And see your face  
In my dreams  
Every hour all night through  
Oh, I'm haunted  
Yes I'm haunted, haunted by you  
  
There ain't no doubt  
I can't get out  
Of this trouble that you've got me in  
If I hurt you  
Didn't mean to  
Oh, and I'm sorry  
Ain't the word I've been  
And if you don't come back to me pretty soon  
I don't know what I'm gonna do  
  
'Cause I'm haunted  
Yes I'm haunted, haunted by you, woah, oh  
  
Oh, I just can't forget you  
'Cause you haunt me everywhere I go  
Oh I'm begging you  
Don't say no  
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no  
  
And if you don't come back to me pretty soon  
I don't know what I'm gonna do  
'Cause I'm haunted  
Said I'm haunted,ooh, haunted by you  
Oh, haunted by you  
Haunted by you  
Haunted by you-hoo  
Haunted by you  
Oh, haunted by you  
Baby, haunted by you  
Ooh, by you

Ooh, hoo  
It was back in 'sixty-three  
We were young and we were free  
Thought the world was really ours for the taking  
We had heart and we had soul  
Ooh, we lived for rock and roll  
And didn't we, didn't we, didn't we do it?  
Fashions come and fashions go  
We were there so we should know  
I sometimes smile when I think of how I looked then  
Burning candles at both ends  
Hoping time would make amends  
And didn't we, didn't we, didn't we do it?  
With heart and soul  
The world is yours, the stars are too  
If you bring out the best in you  
With heart and soul  
Whatever you've been wantin' to do  
Heart and soul will see it through, oh, ho  
Now we're older nothing's changed  
Just some things are rearranged  
But the message is the same as when we started  
We're gettin' stronger everyday  
Looking back now we can say  
Didn't we, didn't we, didn't we do it?, ahh  
With heart and soul  
The world is yours, the stars are too  
If you bring out the best in you  
With heart and soul  
Whatever you've been wantin' to do  
Heart and soul will see it through, ahh  
See it through, see it through, ooh, hoo  
Ooh, hoo, sing it, sing it, sing it, oh, yeah  
With heart and soul  
The world is yours, the stars are too  
If you bring out the best in you  
With heart and soul  
Whatever you've been wantin' to do  
Heart and soul will see it through  
Oh, ho, it will see, will see, will see it through, ooh, hoo  
You can see it, you can see it, see it, see it through  
You can see it, you can see it  

Today I went out on a movie call  
I saw a million nervous faces  
I knew them all  
Hollywood movie girls  
We're all wearing our one good interview dress  
The one showin' our legs  
Aah, we're lookin' our best  
Now, who will be chosen for the screen test?  
It's your guess  
Hollywood movie girls  
And each and every potential star  
Drives home in the night in her economy car  
Whoever thought home would be a one-room flat?  
Well, as simple as that  
Hollywood movie girls  
Each morning up early to call on the 'phone  
Agents, producers, oh, they're never at home  
Like door-to-door salesmen, we are selling ourselves  
Ooh, nothing else  
Hollywood movie girls  
And each and every potential star  
Drives home in the night in her economy car  
Whoever thought home would be a one-room flat?  
Well, as simple as that  
Hollywood movie girls  
And just about bedtime each one of us asks  
Tell me, when will I make it to the big-time at last?  
Oh, small parts you're offered  
Aah, but those too shall pass  
Nothing lasts  
Hollywood movie girls  
Yeah, and each and every potential star  
Drives home in the night in her economy car  
Whoever thought home would be a one-room flat?  
Well, as simple as that  
Hollywood movie girls  
Oh, star light, star bright, won't you wish on me tonight?  
Wish I may, wish I might  
Shine your light for me  

How can I be sure?  
In a world that's constantly changing  
How can I be sure?  
Where I stand with you  
  
Whenever i  
Whenever I am away from you  
I wanna die  
'cause you know I wanna stay with you  
  
How do I know?  
Maybe you're trying to use me  
Flying too high can confuse me  
Touch me, but don't take me down  
  
Whenever i  
Whenever I am away from you  
My alibi is telling people  
I don't care for you  
  
Maybe I'm just hanging round  
With my head up, upside down  
It's a pity for you  
I can't seem to find somebody new that's as  
Wonderful baby as you  
  
How can I be sure?  
I really, really, really, wanna know  
Really, really, wanna know , yeah  
  
Also whether  
Whether or not we're together  
Together will seem that much better  
I love you, I love you forever  
You know where I can be found  
  
How can I be sure?  
In a world that's constantly changing  
How can I be sure  
I'll be sure with you?

I'm curious, I want to know  
I'm an idealist, I'll let it show  
I'm curious with myself  
I'm delirious from wanting  
  
The noise that announces a seduction  
I'm a volcano  
In a state of eruption  
I live life with a wild intensity  
Need to be aroused  
To the point of intimacy  
  
What are your motives?  
I got to know  
I'm doing research  
I got to know  
What are your motives?  
I got to know  
Tell me your motives, oh, oh  
  
'Cause I'm curious, I want to know  
I'm an idealist, I'll let it show  
I'm curious with myself  
I'm delirious from wanting  
  
The fusing, the melting of two bodies  
I'm addicted to lethal sexuality  
I live life on the edge of ecstasy  
Need to be desired  
Nothing else fulfills me  
  
What are your motives?  
I got to know  
I'm doing research  
I got to know  
What are your motives?  
I got to know  
Tell me your motives, ooh, ooh  
  
I'm curious, I want to know  
I'm an idealist, I'll let it show  
I'm curious with myself  
I'm delirious from wanting  
  
I'm curious, I want to know  
I'm an idealist, I'll let it show  
I'm curious with myself  
I'm delirious from wanting  
  
Yes, I'm curious, I want to know  
I'm an idealist, I'll let it show  
I am curious with myself  
Too delirious from singing  
'Cause I'm curious, I want to know  
I'm an idealist, I'll let it show  
I'm curious with myself  
I'm delirious from wanting

And I am your child  
Wherever you go  
You take me too  
Whatever I know  
I learned from you  
Whatever I do  
You taught me to do  
I am your child  
And I am your chance  
  
Whatever will come  
Will come from me  
Tomorrow is won  
By winning me  
Whatever I am  
You taught me to be  
I am your hope  
I am your chance  
And I am your child  
  
Whatever I am  
You taught me to be  
I am your hope  
I am your chance  
And I am your child

It's gone way beyond just lovin'  
And for a long time now  
It's been more than just a thrill  
Oh, honey, I-I-I-I, I believe in you, oh  
Oh, my, na, na, na, na, na, na, woah  
Ma, na, na, na  
Oh, my, na, na, na, na, na, na, woah  
Ma, na, na, na  
  
Oh, well my friends say  
Say that you're good-looking  
But I swear I can't tell them what you look like anymore  
'Cause honey, I-I-I-I-I, I believe in you, oh, oh  
  
Well I feel it, I feel it  
Oh, baby  
I feel it in my heart  
  
Well you did it, you did it  
My heart is full  
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, woah  
Ma, na, na, na  
I've waited a long time  
To have me this feelin'  
A Sunday type of feeling  
All peaceful and out of sight  
Oh, honey,I-I-I-I-I, I believe in you  
Oh, baby  
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, woah  
Ma, na, na, na  
Oh, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, woah  
Ma, na, na, na  
  
I-I-I-I-I, I believe in you  
Yes I do  
Yes I do  
Believe in you  
I-I-I-I-I, I believe in you  
Yes I do  
Yes I do  
Oh, honey, I-I-I-I-I

You want me to say I love you too  
There's nothing in the world I'd rather do  
You will never know how hard I've tried  
But I can't change the way I feel inside  
It's nothing that you did or haven't done  
Who knows what makes somebody love someone?  
I wish that's the way that we could be  
But love is up to love and not to me  
I can't help the way that I don't feel  
Take what isn't there and make it real  
You're where I should be going  
But my heart is at the wheel  
And I can't help the way that I don't feel  
It's nothing that you did or haven't done  
Who knows what makes somebody love someone?  
I wish that's the way that we could be  
But love is up to love and not to me  
I can't help the way but I don't feel  
Take what isn't there and make it real  
You're where I should be going  
But my heart is at the wheel  
And I can't help the way that I don't feel  
Oh, I can't help the way that I don't feel  
Take what isn't there and make it real  
You're where I should be going  
But my heart is at the wheel  
And I can't help the way that I don't feel, oh, oh, oh  

Now you know me  
You know how proud I am  
And what I'm gonna tell you now  
Won't be easy to say  
  
Before I left your side  
Ooh, I was so happy then  
But I've been so lonely  
Since I've been away  
Oh, baby  
  
I've tried and I know I can't make it alone  
It's such a hard way to go  
I just can't make it alone  
There's something in my soul  
That will always  
Lead me back to you  
  
What can I say now?  
Sorry is just not good enough  
I couldn't blame you if you hurt me now  
The way I hurt you then  
  
But who else can I turn to?  
Oh, baby, I'm begging you  
Won't you reach out for my dying soul?  
And make me live again  
Oh, baby, it's so hard  
  
I've tried and I know I can't make it alone  
It's such a hard way to go  
I just can't make it alone  
There's something in my soul  
That will always  
Lead me back to you  
  
Baby, help me  
I've tried and I know I can't make it alone  
It's such a hard way to go  
And I can't make it alone  
There's something in my soul  
That will always  
Lead me back to you  
  
Oh, help me  
(Please help me)  
You know I need you  
(I need you)  
I'm saying that I need you  
I just can't make it by myself  
(I just can't make it by myself)  
I just can't make it all alone  
(I just can't make it all alone)  
I just can't make it by myself  
(I just can't make it by myself)  
Come on baby  

I can't wait until I see my, my baby's face  
When I tell him that I'm through  
Yes, I'm through with him  
'Cause he's been running round  
And I got to, to put him down  
I can't wait to see the look  
The look in his eyes  
  
I wonder if he'll cry  
When I tell him this is goodbye, yes it is  
Or will he try to change my mind  
And make me stay? yeah  
  
Or will he turn around  
And, with a smile on his face  
Just walk away?  
Just walk away  
  
I can't wait until I see my, my baby's face  
Gotta find out what I mean  
What I mean to him  
'Cause just one tear is all he's got to, to shed for me  
And I know that l will run, yes I'll run to him  
I'll hold him tight  
Never, never let him go, no-o-o  
  
And I can't wait until I see my, my baby's face  
You know, I just can't wait until I see my baby's, baby's face  
You know, I just can't wait until I see my, my baby's face  
I can't wait until I

It isn't the way that you look  
And it isn't the way that you talk  
It isn't the things that you say or do  
Make me want you so  
  
It is nothing to do with the wine  
Or the music that's flooding my mind  
But never before have I been so sure  
You're the someone I dreamed I would find  
  
It's the way you make me feel  
The moment I am close to you  
It's a feeling so unreal  
Somehow I can't believe it's true  
The pounding I feel in my heart  
The hoping that we'll never part  
I can't believe this is really happening to me  
  
I close my eyes and count to ten  
And when I open them you're still here  
I close my eyes and count again  
I can't believe it but you're still here  
  
We were strangers a moment ago  
With a few dreams but nothing to show  
The world was a place  
With a frown on its face  
And tomorrow was just, I don't know  
  
But the way you make me feel  
The moment I am close to you  
Makes today seem so unreal  
Somehow I can't believe it's true  
Tomorrow will you still be here?  
Tomorrow will come but I fear  
That what is happening to me  
Is only a dream  
  
I close my eyes and count to ten  
And when I open them you're still here  
I close my eyes and count again  
I can't believe it but you're still here  
I close my eyes and count to ten  
And when I open them you're still here

It's the end of our journey  
What can I do?  
Lonely together  
When I'm alone with you  
  
Now that we've come so far  
It seems like the end  
We could be lovers  
We could never be friends  
  
I don't think we could ever  
I don't think we could ever be friends  
I don't think we could ever  
I don't think we could ever be friends  
I don't think we could ever  
I don't think we could ever be friends  
I don't think we could ever  
I don't think we could ever be friends  
  
We can never talk  
Like others seem to do  
Lonely together  
Making love to you  
  
We don't get nothing  
From the letters we send  
We could be lovers  
We could never be friends  
  
I don't think we could ever  
I don't think we could ever be friends  
I don't think we could ever  
I don't think we could ever be friends  
I don't think we could ever  
I don't think we could ever be friends  
  
Plus a new relationship  
You know you break my heart  
What I feel for you's too strong  
It has been from the start  
Every time I see your face  
It's tearing me apart  
What is need is love from you  
Oh, but I can't?  
  
I don't think we could ever  
I don't think we could ever be friends  
I don't think we could ever  
I don't think we could ever be friends  
I don't think we could ever  
I don't think we could ever be friends  
I don't think we could ever  
I don't think we could ever be friends  
I don't think we could ever  
I don't think we could ever be friends  
I don't think we could ever  
I don't think we could ever be friends  
I don't think we could ever  
I don't think we could ever be friends  
I don't think we could ever  
I don't think we could ever be friends  
I don't think we could ever  
I don't think we could ever be friends  
Ah, ha

In my neighborhood  
We don't live so good  
The rooms are small  
And the buildings made of wood  
  
I hear the neighbors talking 'bout you and me  
I guess I heard it all  
'Cause the talk is loud  
And the walls are much too thin  
  
He don't really love her  
That's what I heard them say  
He sure wasn't thinking of her today, oh no  
(He wasn't thinking of her today)  
  
I saw them in the front yard  
Said the boy in room one four nine  
He was talking to a girl I've never seen before  
And standing there together, oh, they looked so good  
  
I don't want to hear it anymore  
(I don't want to hear it)  
I don't want to hear it anymore  
(Anymore)  
'Cause the talk just never ends  
And the heartache soon begins  
The talk is so loud  
And the walls are much too thin  
  
Ain't it sad, said the woman down the hall  
That when a nice girl falls in love  
Ain't it just too bad that she had to fall  
For a boy who doesn't care for her at all?  
(It's so sad)  
  
I don't want to hear it anymore  
(I don't want to hear it)  
I just can't stand to hear it anymore  
(Anymore)  
'Cause the talk just never ends  
And the heartache soon begins  
The talk is so loud  
And the walls are much too thin  
  
I don't want to hear it anymore  
(Can't stand to hear it)  
(Don't want to hear it)  
I just can't stand to hear it anymore  
(Don't talk about it)  
(Can't stand to hear it)  
Oh, baby, baby  
I just can't stand

I found it, I found it, ooh  
True, true lovin' with you  
Ahh, ha, ooh, I got so much to give, so much to live for  
'Cause darlin', I found love with you  
I got so much to share, so much to care for  
'Cause darlin', I found love with you  
Ooh, I found out, what true love is really all about  
Ooh, and I know that I'll never, ever, never let you go  
I'm so glad that you're here  
So glad that you're near me  
'Cause darlin' I found love with you (found it with you)  
I've been acting like a fool, acting like a schoolgirl  
'Cause darlin' I found love with you  
Ahh, ooh, I found out what true love is really all about  
Ooh, hoo, hoo, and I know, I'll never let you go  
And I'll always love you so  
'Cause darlin' I found true, true lovin' with you  
Ooh, hoo, hoo  
(I know) Yes I know, heaven's just a little closer to me  
(I see) Yes I see, how wonderful our love could be together  
You and me (I want you, baby, baby)  
Can't you see (I need you darlin'), ah, ha  
I got so much to live, so much to live for  
'Cause darlin' I found love with you (found it with you)  
I got so much to share, so much to care for  
'Cause darlin', I found love with you (found it with you)  
Ooh, I found out, oh, what true love is really all about  
Ooh, and I know, I'll never let you go  
And I'll always love you so  
'Cause darlin', I found true, true lovin'  
No, I'll never, ever, never, ooh, I found it  
Yes, I found it  
Never, ever let you go  
I found it, true, true lovin' with you  
I found it, yes, I found it, sweet baby  
Found it with you  
I'll never, oh, I'll never, ahh  
'Cause I found it with you  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, aah, found it with you  
I found it, I found it, sweet darlin'  
Found it with you  

I had a talk with my man last night  
He reassured me everything was still all right  
As the night grew light  
My blues got bright  
He made me know  
I was the star of the show  
  
He said he was mine all to myself  
And i won't, and he won't, ever need nobody else  
He took me in his arms  
And turned on my love  
Ooh, yes he did, yes he did, yes he did, oh, oh  
I had a talk with my man last night  
  
He said never again lonely would i be  
And that's when he asked to marry me  
I began to cry  
He kissed the tears from my weeping eyes  
Oh, yes he did, yes he did, yes he did, oh, oh  
I had a talk with my man last night

I just don't know what to do with myself  
Don't know just what to do with myself  
I'm so used to doing everything with you  
Planning everything for two  
And now that we're through  
  
I just don't know what to do with my time  
I'm so lonesome for you it's a crime  
Going to the movie only makes me sad  
Parties make me feel as bad  
When I'm not with you  
I just don't know what to do  
  
Like a summer rose  
It needs the sun and rain  
Oh, I need your sweet love  
To beat all the pain  
  
I just don't know what to do with myself  
I just don't know what to do with myself  
Baby, if your new love ever turns you down  
Come back, I will be around  
Just waiting for you  
I don't know what else to do  
  
Like a summer rose  
It needs the sun and rain  
Oh, I need your sweet love  
To beat all the pain  
  
I don't know just what to do with myself  
I don't know just what to do with myself  
Baby, if your new love ever turns you down  
Come on back, I will be around  
Just waiting for you  
I don't know what else to do, no, no, no  
I don't know what else to do  
I'm still so crazy for you, no, no, no, no  
I don't know what else to do, no, no, no  
I'm still so crazy for you

Now when the storm of life is rushing in on you  
And all hope is gone  
And you feel the pain and misery of  
Being left all alone  
After you've tried so hard and your life  
Is standing still  
And you think you just don't have the  
Strength to climb another hill  
  
Oh, I just want to be there  
I just want to be there  
Just to hold you close  
Said I want to be there  
I just want to be there  
'Cause I love you most  
  
When you need a little understanding from  
Your so-called friends  
And you find the road you're travelling down is  
Coming do a dead-end  
When suddenly you find yourself lost and  
Stumbling through the night  
Now let me be the hand in the dark that's leading  
You to the light  
  
Oh, I just want to be there  
I just want to be there  
Just to hold you close  
Said I want to be there  
I just want to be there  
'Cause I love you most  
Ooh, ooh, I want to be there  
Baby, baby, baby, baby, I want to be there, yeah  
want to be there  
Said I want to be there  
I just want to be there  
'Cause I love you most  
  
Promise not to ever try to change you  
I love you for yourself  
No matter what you choose to be your fate  
Now let me be your helpmate  
Let me be the main source of power that  
Makes your wheels turn  
And let me be the wood in the furnace to make  
Your fire burn  
  
Yeah, I just want to be there  
Just to hold you close  
Said I want to be there  
'Cause I love you most  
Ooh, hey, I want to be there  
Said I want to be there  
'Cause I love you most  
Said I want to be, want to be, want to be there, yeah  
'Cause I love you most

Change the mood I'm in  
For a little while  
Let me see that grin  
Let me see you smile  
  
No soulful tales that fret and frown  
No woeful wails that get me down  
No rights or wrongs  
Sing no sad songs for me  
  
I only want to laugh  
No time for crying  
I only want to laugh  
No time for tears  
  
I only want to sing  
A song that's happy  
That's why I only want to walk a street that's sunny  
I only want to see the side that's funny  
  
I'm saving all of my tears until tomorrow  
'Cause crying all my tears  
Just ain't my style  
I'm acting like a clown  
But let me be  
'Cause even though I know  
The joke's on me  
I only want to laugh  
Only want to laugh  
Only want to laugh  
  
I'm saving all of my tears until tomorrow  
'Cause crying all my tears  
Baby, just ain't my style  
I'm acting like a clown  
But let me be  
'Cause even though the joke's on me, oh  
Tell the girls goodbye  
'Cause I don't want to cry  
Hey  
I only want to laugh  
Only want to laugh  
Only want to laugh

This year, next year  
Sometime never  
Paper dreams tied up  
With bits of string  
Darkness comes  
Flowers grow  
No-one knows  
I start counting  
I start counting  
  
Sitting by myself in a secret  
Chasing thoughts through rainbows in my mind, yeah  
Changing time  
Tomorrow's dream  
In between  
I start counting  
Counting, yes I do  
Counting, counting, counting, counting, counting  
Ooh-hoo-oo, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve etc.

Broken windows  
In empty hallways  
Pale dead moon  
And the sky streaked with grey  
Human kindness overflowing  
And I think it's gonna rain today  
  
Scarecrows dressed in the latest styles  
With frozen smiles to keep love away  
Human kindness overflowing  
And I think it's gonna rain today  
  
Lonely, lonely  
Tin can at my feet  
I think I'll kick it down the street  
That's the way to treat a friend  
  
Right before me  
The signs implore me  
Help the needy  
And show them the way  
Human kindness, it's overflowing  
And I think it's gonna rain today  
  
Lonely, so lonely  
Tin can at my feet  
I think I'll kick it down the street  
That's the way to treat a friend  
  
Right before me  
The signs implore me  
Help the needy  
And show them the way  
Human kindness, it's overflowing  
And I think it's gonna rain today

What a nice party  
And I know just why I'm feeling so new  
'Cause I came along and I found you  
  
I want to make you happy tonight  
I want to make you happy tonight  
  
It's just like magic  
Dancing with you  
While we're sharing a kiss  
Oh, I've been in love  
But never, no, never like this  
  
I want to make you happy tonight  
I want to make you happy tonight, and every day I live, yeah  
I want to give you all I have to give  
Oh, I want to make you so happy, yeah, oh  
  
Yes, I've been in love  
But never, no, never like this  
I want to make you happy tonight  
I want to make you so happy, child  
Come on, I want to make you so

I don't wanna go to the party with you  
I don't wanna go to the dance  
I don't wanna go anywhere with you  
I just wanna stay here and love you  
  
Now that I can be alone with you  
I won't throw away the chance  
There's no other place like home with you  
I just wanna stay here and love you  
  
All through the week  
I miss you so  
But, now that I've got you  
I'm gonna hold you closer and closer and closer  
  
I don't wanna go out walking with you  
And now that I am in this trance  
I don't even know if I'll talk to you  
I just wanna stay here and  
I wanna love you, I wanna love you  
  
I just wanna stay here and love you  
I wanna stay here and love you  
Yes, I wanna stay here and love you  
Just wanna stay here and love you, ooh-ho, baby, baby  
I wanna stay here and love you  
Yes, I wanna stay here and love you  

Oh, love is like a flame, now  
Upon a candle  
Get it burnin' brightly  
And it's a-too hot to handle  
Oh, baby  
(I want your love tonight)  
Come on and satisfy me  
Baby, don't deny me  
(I want your love tonight)  
Excuses, boy don't hand me  
Just love and understand me  
  
Oh, patiently I've waited  
For your sweet kissin'  
Though we steady-dated  
You know, somethin's been a-missin', oh, oh  
(I want your love tonight)  
I don't want to sit here and talk  
(I want your love tonight)  
I don't want to go for a walk  
(I want your love tonight)  
Oh, take me up to heaven  
All the way to cloud eleven  
  
I want a-your love tonight  
Oh, yeah I do  
Come on and love me, baby  
Oh, come on and satisfy me  
Baby, don't deny me, yeah  
(I want your love tonight)  
Love me, love me, baby  
(I want your love)

Don't go  
There's so much left to tell you  
You just don't know how need you  
I never said how I cared  
Until now that you're leaving  
I can't hide what I'm feeling  
  
Please wait, there's so much left to tell you  
I never said how I loved you  
Oh, can't you stay one more day?  
And I'll try to show all of the love  
That I used to keep from you  
  
Words alone can't make you love me  
But how else am I to say to you  
That I know I will always want you?  
  
Help me, I can't stop myself crying  
Help me, 'cause I feel like I'm dying  
Please can't you stay with me?  
'Cause I can't live without you, my love  
  
Words alone can't make you love me  
But how else am I to say to you  
That I know I will always want you? Oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
So, help me, I can't stop myself crying  
Help me 'cause I feel like I'm dying  
Please can't you stay with me?  
'Cause I can't live without you, my love

Just like a ship sailing out, on a mornin' tide  
Sailing far away out to sea and the sea is very wide  
You walked away where there's lots of room to hide  
Out into the world and the world is very wide  
But one day, (baby, one day), baby, one day  
  
[Chorus: ]  
I will come to you if it takes everyday left in my life  
I will come to you for there must be someone in my life  
No matter where you are  
I'll find you near or far  
Or I will never love 'til I can love with you  
And I won't really live  
For life without you is like dying  
  
Don't know where you are  
And I don't know if you think of me  
But where you are  
Is the only place I want to be  
Lost in a world of nothing much to do  
That's how I am ever since losing you  
But one day, (baby, one day), oh, baby, one day  
  
[Chorus: ]  
  
(I will come to you, ooh, ooh)  
There must be someone in my life  
(I will come to you, ooh, ooh)  
(I will come to you, ooh, ooh)  
Oh baby, there must be someone in my life, baby  
(I will come to you, ooh, ooh)  
Oh, everyday left in my life

I wish Id never loved you  
I wish Id never wanted you so much  
And never thrilled to your touch  
And I would not be lonely and crying  
And hurting deep inside  
Alone with a need that cant be satisfied  
  
I wish Id never loved you  
I wish Id never given you my heart  
And watch you tear it all apart  
And I would not be tortured, tormented and cheated  
And surely my heart would not be broken in two  
  
I saw you with another  
I watched you hold her tenderly  
And I could see as you kissed her  
Youd never come back to me, oh  
  
I wish Id never loved you, mmm  
I wish youd never burned me with your kiss  
Oh, how can I go on like this?  
And I would not be tortured, tormented and cheated  
How I wish Id never loved you  
  
And I could see as you kissed her  
Youd never come back to me  
  
Oh, I wish Id never loved you  
I wish youd never burned me with your kiss  
Oh, how can I go on like this?  
And I would not be tortured, tormented and cheated  
How I wish Id never loved you  
Oh, I wish Id never loved you  
How I wish Id never, no, no, never  
Id never loved you

I'd rather leave while I'm in love  
While I still believe the meaning of the word  
I'll keep my dreams and just pretend  
That you and I were never meant to end  
  
Too many times I've seen the rose die on the vine  
Somebody's heart gets broken  
And usually it's mine  
I don't wanna take the chance of being hurt again  
And you and I can't say goodbye  
  
So, if you wake and find me gone  
Oh, babe, just carry on  
You see, I need my fantasy  
I still believe it's best to leave while I'm in love, ooh  
  
Too many times I've seen the rose die on the vine  
Somebody's heart gets broken, yeah  
And usually it's mine  
I don't wanna take the chance of being hurt again  
And you and i, we can't say goodbye  
  
So, if you wake and find me gone  
Hey, babe, just carry on  
You see, I need my fantasy  
I still believe it's best to leave while I'm in love, oh, oh  
I'd rather leave while I'm in love

When he loved me nothing in this world  
Could touch his love  
And now the light of love is back  
Can I return the joys he's dreaming of  
I don't know  
I don't know  
  
(But if it don't work out)  
The tears that I'm crying baby  
Won't bring him home, no, no  
I want to bring him home  
  
Will he still care for me  
The way he did he before  
Or, will he turn away  
And tell me he don't love me anymore  
I don't know  
Oh, I don't know  
  
(But if it don't work out)  
The tears that I'm crying, baby  
Won't bring him home  
I want to bring him home  
  
But if I could forget  
The tears and the crying  
That I went through once before, yeah  
Maybe my love and I could start  
We'd start again, yeah  
  
One day I know we'll find again  
The love we had and I  
Will know and feel  
The joys and pleasures that I'm dreaming of  
I don't know  
I don't know  
  
(But if it don't work out)  
The tears that I'm crying, baby  
Ain't going to bring him home, again  
Ain't going to bring him home  
  
Hey, but if it don't work out  
The tears that I'm crying, baby  
Hey, ain't going to bring him home again  
I'm going to cry my heart out waiting for him, yeah  
Cry my heart out, yes I will  
Cry my heart out, yes I will  
Cry my heart

Baby, if wishes could be kisses  
And dreams could make you mine  
I wouldn't be a-sitting here  
Wasting all this time  
No, no, baby, if you call me  
I'd race down the street  
I'd be there so fast  
You'd think I had wings on my feet  
Oh, baby, if wishes could be kisses  
I'd wish with all my mind  
I wouldn't have to make believe  
I'm in your arms tonight  
  
No, no, baby  
I could thrill you if you'd let me try  
We'd take off together  
And we'd tell this world goodbye  
  
But I know it just can't be  
Unless you feel the same as me, oh, yeah-heah  
Baby, if wishes could be kisses  
Then I'd be first in line  
If I'm not wrong it won't take long  
'Til you're my valentine  
  
Oh, oh, baby, if you hear me  
Make me know you do  
If I'm lucky I'll find out  
That you've been wishing too  
A-come on, baby  
A-come on, baby  
If wishes could be kisses, oh, yeah  
Oh, if wishes could be  
  
Woah, baby, if you hear me  
Make me know you do  
If I'm lucky I'll find out  
That you've been wishing too  
A-come on, baby  
Woah, come on, baby  
If wishes could be kisses, now, yeah  
If wishes could be kisses, yeah

I would be your water when your thirsty mouth was dry  
I would be your sunshine when clouds are in the sky  
I would stand that close beside you  
And be your only friend  
And I have promised love forever  
There will be no end  
  
Ooh, hoo, I'll be faithful  
Ooh, hoo, I'll be true, too  
Ooh, hoo, I'll be faithful, yes I will now  
Ooh, hoo, oh my, true to you  
  
Now I would be your music if you would like a song  
I would sleep beside you when the winter's cold and long  
I would be the pole to guide you, never would I bend  
And I have promised love forever  
There will be no end  
  
Ooh, hoo, I'll be faithful, oh, yeah  
Ooh, hoo, I'll be true too, mmm  
Ooh, hoo, I'll be faithful, oh, yeah  
Ooh, hoo, oh my, true to you, ooh, hoo  
  
I have promised love forever  
There will be no end  
  
Ooh, hoo, I'll be faithful, oh, yeah  
Ooh, hoo, I'll be true, too  
Ooh, hoo, I'll be faithful, yes I will  
Ooh, hoo, oh my, true to you

Yeah, I will love you for a while  
Just how long I cannot say  
Long before love grows old  
I'll be on my way  
  
While there's fire in your eyes  
I will hold you to my heart  
Oh, but when the fire dies  
We will have to part  
  
Love is strange  
While now it makes us glad  
When our love's no longer new  
It'll make us sad, yeah  
  
So, I will love you for a while  
More than that I will not tell  
When I leave you  
You will say that I loved too well  
  
Yeah, love is strange  
While now it makes us glad  
When our love's no longer new  
It'll make us sad, yeah  
  
So, I will love you for a while  
More than that I will not tell  
And when I leave you  
You will say that I loved too well  
Say that I loved too well, boy  
Say that I loved too well, yeah  
Say that I loved too well-ell  
Say that I loved too well, child  
Say that I loved too well

You belong  
To somebody else and not to me  
Right or wrong  
That's not the way that it's going to be  
I want you so much inside  
I'm throwing away all my conscience and pride, and  
  
I'll try anything to get you  
I'll do anything I can  
I'll try anything to get you  
I'll cheat and I'll lie  
And I'll try 'til I die  
Till I make you my man  
Going to make you my man  
  
I've been burned  
Whenever I've followed all the rules  
So I've learned  
That playing it fair is just for fools  
I'm fighting and win or lose  
I'm not minding my P's and Q's, and  
  
I'll try anything to get you  
I'll do anything I can  
I'll try anything to get you  
I'll cheat and I'll lie  
Try 'til I die  
Till I make you my man  
My man, hey, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  
  
I want you so much inside  
I'm throwing away all my conscience and pride, and  
  
I'll try anything to get you  
I'll do anything I can  
I'll try anything to get you  
I'll cheat and I'll lie  
Try 'til I die  
Till I make you my man  
Going to make you my man  
Going to make you my man, yeah  
Make you my man  
Going to fight 'til I die  
Going to cheat and lie

I'm not as crazy as I used to be  
Some of my devils upped and left me free  
To find a quiet space  
I'm not as out of place  
  
I'm not as lonely as I was before  
I don't go in 'less there's an open door to leave by  
I'm starting to believe my own existence has a right to be  
  
And I'm comin' home again  
It's been too long a time  
Gettin' back what's mine  
And I can't remember why I went away  
But it's lookin' now like maybe I can stay  
  
The poets cried for dreams they never saw  
The only certainty is nothin's sure  
And most things stay the same  
Or go back where they came  
  
And though my answers still are undefined  
By takin' chances I can start to find some reasons  
Somethin' to believe in  
I can make it through  
I can make it through  
  
And I'm comin' home again  
It's been too long a time  
Gettin' back what's mine  
And I can't remember why I went away  
But it's lookin' now like maybe I can stay  
  
Oh, and I'm comin' home again  
It's been too long a time  
Gettin' back what's mine  
And I can't remember why I went away  
But it's lookin' now like maybe I can stay

I've been trying hard to see  
Just what you want of me  
But it's no good boy  
I'm setting you free  
'Cause I need you so much more  
With each day that passes by  
You don't seem to care  
It's making me cry  
  
So I'm packing up my bags  
Gonna make my getaway  
Get myself together  
I can't go on this way  
Oh, baby, baby  
I'm gonna leave you  
I'm gonna leave you, baby  
  
This lonely feeling deep in my mind  
'Cause I can't turn back  
If I leave you behind  
But I gotta do it now  
Yes, I gotta turn away  
Hold me one more time  
Don't ask me to stay  
  
It's so hard so say goodbye  
But it's you I'm thinking of  
It would never work out  
I know you're not in love with me  
Oh, baby  
I'm gonna leave you  
Said, I'm gonna leave you  
  
It's over and I'm walking out on you  
You'll never get the chance to feel untrue  
Though I love you  
And I need you  
And I want you  
I'm still walking out on you  
  
Darling, though it hurts me so inside  
I can't take no more  
Gonna lose my mind  
So I'm packing up my bags  
Gonna make my getaway  
Get myself together  
I can't go on this way  
Oh, baby, baby  
I'm gonna leave you  
Said I'm gonna leave you, baby  
Yes I'm gonna leave you, baby  
Oh, I'm gonna leave you baby  
Ooh, ooh  
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Take your time and tell me  
Where you lie  
I realize  
That we've been found out this time  
  
We should stay together  
If we can  
But what you've planned  
Means there's a difference between  
  
[Chorus]  
What you're gonna say  
In private  
You still want my love  
We're in this together  
And what you're gonna do  
In public  
Say you were never in love  
That you can remember  
  
So discreet  
I never tried to meet  
Your friends or interfere  
I took a back seat between  
  
[Chorus]  
  
What you gonna say, eh  
When you run back to your wife?  
I guess it's just the story of my life  
What you gonna say?  
  
So take your time  
And tell me  
Where did you learn  
Oh, I may publicize  
That there's a difference between  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Tell me what you gonna say  
In private?, oh, oh, oh  
What you gonna say?  
What you gonna do?  
Baby, what you gonna say?

In the land of make believe  
You're mine tonight  
Although you are far away  
In the land of make believe  
I'm holding you tight  
  
The silver moon is shining above  
And there's love in your eyes  
And I'm kissing you  
Like I used to do  
Yesterday in paradise  
  
I've been living in the land of make believe  
Since you've been gone  
I need you so much  
That without your love  
I must deceive myself  
To go on  
  
Your loving hand caresses my face  
We embrace tenderly  
Never will we part  
Deep down in my heart  
You are always here with me  
You are always here with me  
In the land of make believe  
In the land of make believe  
In the land of make believe  
  
Your loving hand caresses my face  
We embrace tenderly  
Never will we part  
Deep down in my heart  
You are always here with me  
You are always here with me  
In the land of make believe  
In the land of make believe  
In the land of make believe  
In the land of make believe

Where does our love lie  
In the middle of nowhere  
Will it soon pass me by  
In the middle of nowhere  
  
Baby, won't you tell me  
What am I to do  
I'm in the middle of nowhere  
Getting nowhere with you  
  
Mmm, where did my heart land  
In the middle of nowhere  
Where are the dreams I planned  
In the middle of nowhere  
  
Listen to me baby  
Listen to my plea  
I'm in the middle of nowhere  
And it's worrying me  
  
Over and over again  
You tell me you need my love  
If what you say is true  
Why can't we be together  
  
Over and over you tell me  
I'm all that you're thinking of  
Baby you know that I love you  
But I can't wait forever  
  
Where does our love lie  
In the middle of nowhere  
How can you let it die  
In the middle of nowhere  
  
Are you going to leave me  
Leave my heart astray  
I'm in the middle of nowhere  
Come and show me the way  
  
Over and over again  
You tell me you need my love  
Baby you know that I love you  
But I can't wait forever  
  
Where does our love lie  
In the middle of nowhere  
How can you let it die  
In the middle of nowhere  
  
Are you going to leave me  
And leave my heart astray  
I'm in the middle of nowhere  
Come and show me the way  
  
Hey, where does out love lie  
Come on now  
Where does our love lie  
Right slap in the middle of nowhere  
Right slap in the middle of nowhere  
Right slap in the middle of nowhere

The days are okay  
I watch the T.V. in the afternoon  
If I get lonely  
The sound of other voices  
Other rooms are near to me  
I'm not afraid  
  
The operator  
She tells the time  
It's good for a laugh  
And there's always radio  
And for a dime I can talk to God  
Dial-a-prayer  
Are you there?  
Do you care?  
Are you there?  
  
And in the Winter extra blankets for the cold  
Fix the heater, getting old  
I am wiser now you know  
And still as big a fool concerning you  
  
I met your friend  
She's very nice, what can I say?  
It was an accident  
I never dreamed we'd meet again this way  
You're looking well  
I'm not afraid, yeah  
  
You have a lovely home  
Just like a picture  
No, I live alone  
I found it easier  
You must remember how I never liked the party life  
Up all night  
Lovely wife  
You have a lovely wife  
  
And in the Winter extra blankets for the cold  
Fix the heater, getting old  
You are with her now I know  
I'll live alone forever, not together, now  
  
And in the Winter extra blankets for the cold  
Fix the heater, getting old  
You are with her now I know  
I'll live alone forever, not together,

I wander the streets  
And the gay crowded places  
Trying to forget you  
But somehow it seems  
That my thoughts ever stray  
To our last sweet embraces  
Over the sea on the island of dreams  
  
[Chorus: x3]  
High in the sky is a bird on a wing  
Please carry me with you  
Far, far away from the mad rushing crowd  
Please carry me with you  
Again I would wander  
Where memories enfold me  
There on the beautiful island of dreams  
  
Far, far away on the island of dreams

If time were not a moving thing  
And I could make it stay  
This love we shared  
Would always be  
There'd be no coming day  
No morning light above  
To make me realize our love  
Is over  
  
And now you walk away from me  
And there's no place to put my hand  
Except to shade my eyes  
Against the sun that comes to warm the land  
I watch you walk away somehow  
I have to let you go now  
It's over  
  
It's too late to tell you how I feel  
Our love was real  
And yet, there are so many times  
That people have to love and then forget  
Though there might have been a way  
I have to force myself to say  
It's over  
  
And so I walk away and turn my collar to the wind  
I walk along in silence trying not to think at all  
I put my feet before me  
Walk the silent street before me  
It's over  
  
If time were not a moving thing  
And I could make it stay  
This love we shared would always be  
There'd be no coming day  
No morning light above  
To make me realize our love  
Is over  
  
It's over  
It's over  
It's over

The night we met  
The night that I won't forget  
You seemed what I'd been waiting for  
But baby, I've been wrong before  
  
You held me tight  
And everything seemed just right  
I couldn't ask for me  
But baby, I've been wrong before  
  
He used to smile at me  
And a-hold my hand like you do  
Then he left me  
And a-broke my heart in two  
  
I see your face  
And feel your warm embrace  
You're all that I adore  
But baby, I've been wrong before  
  
Oh baby, I've been wrong before

(I got a good thing)  
I got a good thing  
(I got a good thing)  
I got a good thing  
(I got a good thing)  
I got a good thing going  
Take the sun and take the moon  
And stars that shine so bright  
All I need is my guy  
And everything's all right  
Everything about him thrills me  
The way he looks at me just kills me  
He's got a way of getting to me  
Every kiss just goes right through me  
(I got a good thing)  
I got a good thing  
(I got a good thing)  
You know I got a good thing, baby  
(I got a good thing)  
I got a good thing going  
Take the rainbow from the sky  
Oh, I don't really care  
I will have a pot of gold  
As long as he is there  
I never knew such sweet affection  
And it's all in my direction  
If he left there's no mistaking  
My poor heart would start to break and  
(I got a good thing)  
I got a good thing  
(I got a good thing)  
You know I got a good thing going, yeah  
You know I got a good thing, yeah  
(I got a good thing)  
I got a good thing, yeah  
(I got a good thing)  
You know I got a good thing going  
(I got a good thing)  
You know I got a sweet thing baby  
(I got a good thing)  
Everything is everything, baby  
(I got a good thing)  
Everything is uptight, all right, out of sight  
(I got a good thing)  
Know I got a ooh, oh, sweet, sweet thing  
(I got a good thing)  
Sweet mmm  
(I got a good thing)  

(Hey, does anybody know)  
(How I can get in touch with Joe?)  
  
If I have to catch a subway  
Or catch a plane on a runway  
I've got to find out some way  
Where did he go?  
  
Yesterday was bright and sunny  
All his jokes were oh-so funny  
Now he's gone and left me  
Honey, where did you go?  
I've been searchin' here and there  
Lookin' for you everywhere  
'Cause your love I want to share  
  
Hey, does anybody know  
How I can get in touch with Joe?  
  
I will try to wait forever  
It could take till the twelfth of never  
How I pray we'd be together  
Where did he go?  
  
My heart was pure  
How could you bruise it?  
Gave him mine  
He just used it  
My mind was clear  
And he confused it  
Where did he go?  
I've been searchin' here and there  
Lookin' for you everywhere  
'Cause your love I want to share  
  
Hey does anybody know  
How I can get in touch with Joe?, ooh  
Does anybody know  
How I can get in touch with Joe?  
I can get in touch with Joe?, ooh Joey, Joey  
Somebody tell me  
Where did he go?, Joe  
Come back baby, Joe, oh, oh, Joey, Joey, Joey

Just a little lovin'  
Early in the mornin'  
Beats a cup of coffee  
For starting off the day  
  
Just a little lovin'  
When the world is yawnin'  
Makes you feel wake up feeling  
Good things are coming your way  
  
This old world  
Wouldn't be half as bad  
It wouldn't be half as sad  
If each and everybody in it had, yeah  
  
Just a little lovin'  
Early in the mornin'  
That little extra somethin'  
To kinda see them through  
  
Nothing turns the day on  
Really gets it dawnin'  
Like a little bit of lovin'  
From some lovin' someone like you  
  
This old world  
Wouldn't be half as bad  
It wouldn't be half as sad  
If each and everybody in it had  
  
Just a little lovin'  
Early in the mornin'  
(Just a little lovin')  
(When the world is yawnin')  
Just a little bit of lovin' ah  
Oh, in the morning  
Nothing turns the day on  
Really gets it dawnin'  
Make a little bit of lovin'  
It's so good, it's so good  

Can't I cry a little bit?  
There's nobody to notice it  
Can't I cry if I want to?  
No-one cares  
  
Why can't I pretend  
That you'll love me again?  
All I had has been taken from me  
Now I cry tears that never become me  
  
Just one smile means forgiving  
Just one kiss, the hurt's all gone  
Just one smile to make my life worth living  
A little dream to build my world upon  
  
How I wish I could say  
All the things I want to say  
If some way, you could see what's in my heart  
Oh, baby  
  
I don't ask for much  
A look, a smile, a touch  
Try to forget  
Lord knows, I'm trying  
It's so hard to forget  
When your whole world you know is dying  
  
Just one smile means forgiving  
Just one kiss, the hurt's all gone  
Just one smile to make my life worth living  
A little dream to build my world upon  
  
Just one smile please forgiving  
Just one kiss, hurt's all gone  
Just one smile to make my life worth living  
A little dream to build my world upon  
Just one smile

When I close my eyes I can see your face  
Tho' I try I can't believe that you are gone  
There's a part of you that's a part of me  
And no matter where I go it comes along  
Reminding me of all the good times  
And, of course, some of the bad  
But then again, some of those hard times  
Were the best we ever had  
  
How can I learn to say goodbye  
To the only life I ever knew?  
Learn to say goodbye to you?  
How can I learn to say goodbye?  
Tell me how do you expect me to  
Say goodbye to you?  
  
When I needed you, you were always there  
You were more than love to me, you were a friend  
They say that time is all that matters  
And to live it while it lasts  
But I can't stop from reminiscing  
Or stop living in the past  
  
How can I learn to say goodbye  
To the only life I ever knew?  
Learn to say goodbye to you?  
How can I learn to say goodbye?  
Tell me how do you expect me to  
Say goodbye to you?  
  
How can I learn to say goodbye  
To the only life I ever knew?  
Say goodbye to you?  
How can I learn to say goodbye?  
Tell me how do you expect me to  
Say goodbye to you?

(Please)  
(Let me get in your way)  
Call me sad and blue  
All I need is your good lovin'  
Just to see me through  
Call me lonely, too  
You should never, ever make me  
Need you like I do  
Can't you see I'm not naggin', baby?  
This heart of mine is just saggin', baby  
Please  
Let me get in your way  
Just have somethin' to say to me  
Please  
Let me get in your way  
Just have somethin' you can say to me  
I'm not asking you  
To move a mountain, swim a river  
Or walk on the moon  
Call me beggin', too  
For a little of the love I need  
So much from you  
Can't you see I'm not naggin', baby?  
This heart of mine is just saggin', baby  
Please  
Let me get in your way  
Just have somethin' you can say to me  
Oh, please  
Let me get in your way  
Just have somethin' you can say to me, ooh  
Oh, please  
Let me get in your way  
Just have something you can say to me  
Baby, please  
Let me get in your way  
Just have somethin' you can say to me  
Baby, please, please, please  
Let me get in your way  
Just have something you can say, baby  

When I'm away from you, boy  
All I seem to do is cry  
Then, when I see you, boy  
My, how the time does fly  
I don't know if you need and love me  
The way I love and need you  
I just hope that we can get together soon, real soon  
  
When I think about you, boy  
Chills run up and down my spine  
If my wish'd come true, boy  
I'd be with you all the time  
Wrong or right, day and night I miss you  
And all my heart seems to do  
Is just hope that we can get together soon, real soon  
  
Wrong or right, day and night I miss you  
And all my heart seems to do  
Is just hope that we can get together soon  
Oh, hope that we can get together soon  
Oh, just hope that we, we can get together, baby  
Hope that we can get together soon  
I just hope that we, we can get together, baby  
Hope that we

Talk it over  
Talk it over  
You seem to think  
That everything is more important than me, baby  
As if to think  
My world would be lonely without you on the scene  
Oh, it's about time  
I moved up the ladder  
Got to be number one  
Or nothin' at all  
Let's sit down, talk it over  
Take that finger from your face  
Look at me for goodness sake  
Talk it over, hey  
Talk about it  
I do everything I can  
To make life easy for you, baby  
But you take me for granted  
What is our love, our love comin' to? Oh  
It's about time for us to have a talk  
And maybe I'm not satisfyin' you, boy  
You gotta tell me 'cause this ain't right  
Why ain't you, oh, be holding me tight?  
Let's sit down, talk it over  
Take that finger from your face  
Look at me for goodness sake

Little by little by little by little by little  
Little by little by little by little by little  
  
You're messing up my life  
Tearing me apart  
Breaking up my world  
And I'm giving up my heart  
Little by little by little by little  
  
I'm losing all my pride  
It's really getting bad  
Hurting deep inside  
Is a-making me go mad, ooh  
Little by little by little by little  
  
Little by little  
Bit by bit  
I'm going crazy and you're causing it  
Little by little  
Bit by bit  
I should stop caring  
But my love won't quit  
  
Little by little by little by little by little, yeah  
Little by little by little by little by little, all right  
  
I don't know where to turn  
Don't know what to do  
I'm walking on thin ice  
And it seems I'm falling through, ooh  
Little by little by little by little  
  
Little by little  
Bit by bit  
I'm going crazy and you're causing it  
Little by little  
Bit by bit  
I should stop caring  
But my love won't quit  
  
I'm the queen of fools  
Know the deck is stacked  
On a losing streak  
But I'm a-going to get you back  
  
Little by little by little by little  
(Little by little by little by little by little)  
Yeah, little by little  
(Little by little by little by little by little)  
Ah, ah, ah, little by little  
(Little by little by little by little by little)  
Little by little, mmm  
(Little by little by little by little by)

You ask me to live here with you  
If I could, love, you know I would  
I can't give you my heart or my hand though you want it  
I can't give you the love I know I should  
And I tell you there's nobody else  
It's not you, I'm just afraid  
Will you show me the way?  
So, I'm sure that I love you  
Show me how true love is made  
If I could I would give you my heart and my hand  
I'd give you the sea, I'd give you the land  
If I found love to give you  
I would give you my life, mmm, mmm, mmm, ooh, hoo, hoo, mmm  
In my sorrow I've called out your name  
In my dreams I've known only you  
Is this love that I feel?  
Am I foolin' myself when I wish for my dreams to come true?  
If I could I would give you my heart and my hand  
I'd give you the sea, I'd give you the land  
If I found love to give you  
I'd give you my life, mmm, mmm, mmm, ooh, hoo, hoo, mmm  
All the pain on my life would be gone  
Oh, my love, if you only knew  
You'd be kissin' away all the tears of my joy  
When you ask me to live here with you  

Now, you work all week just to make that money, yeah  
A-waitin' for the weekend to finally come, yeah, yeah  
So, now that the weekend is finally here  
There's nothing but music in the atmosphere  
So, come on everybody, let's live it up, yeah  
  
The music sounds good and the beat is so groovy, yeah  
It really sounds good 'cause it really, really moves me, yeah  
Oh, dancing dances won't cost you a dime  
Listen to the beat and you're bound a good time  
So, come on everybody, let's live it up, yeah  
  
Listen to the music, 'cause it sounds so sweet  
So, come on everybody  
It makes you want to move your feet, oh yeah  
Live it up, living it up, oh, live it up, baby  
Come on, live it up, live it up, live it up, yeah, yeah  
  
The music sounds good and the beat is so groovy, yeah, come on now  
It really sounds good, 'cause it really, really moves me, yeah  
So, now that the weekend is finally here  
There's nothing but music in the atmosphere  
So, come on everybody, let's live it up, yeah, I said come on, and live it up,
baby  
A-come on, and live it up, yeah, I said

If I passed you on the street  
Would you look the other way  
Afraid that we would meet  
Could it be that it's down to tears?  
After all the love we knew  
It was so hard losing you  
Now I feel it coming on  
That emptiness again  
  
'Cause I've been living without your love  
Just making believe I can still get by  
Paying the price inside, oh  
God knows the hardest thing I'll ever do  
Losing you, ooh, oh  
  
I try to put the thoughts away  
But I see your face before me  
As you turn to walk away  
And I can force a smile  
'Cause it turned out so wrong  
After feeling so right so long  
And I'm just not ready for another day alone  
  
'Cause I've been living without your love  
Just making believe I can still get by  
Paying the price inside, oh  
God knows the hardest thing I'll ever do  
Losing you  
  
Yeah, yeah  
I feel it coming on  
That emptiness again  
  
'Cause I've been living without your love, oh  
Just making believe I can still get by  
Paying the price inside  
Lord knows the hardest thing I'll ever do  
Losing you  
  
I'm, just living  
Oh, living without your love  
I'll get by  
But I'm paying, yeah  
Without your love  
I can't get back to much more love  
Oh no  
I'm not ready for  
I'm not ready for  
Love and loneliness  
Living, oh yes, I'm living without your love  
I'll just get by  
I'm just getting by  
I can't stand it much longer  
Ah, living, living without

Tonight will be for the first time  
I have learned what my lips are for  
And darling, now that I've kissed you  
I'm craving to kiss you more  
Let me tell you long after tonight is all over  
Long after tonight is all gone I?ll be yours  
Forever and a day and yours, come anything that may  
You'll always be just everything to me, yeah  
Here in my arms when I hold you  
I can feel that the world is mine  
Don't go away, don't you leave me  
Or I?ll cry ?til the end of time  
Let me tell you, long after tonight is all over  
Long after it?s all gone I?ll be yours  
Come anything that may and yours, forever and a day  
You'll always be just everything to me, yeah  
Let me tell you long after tonight is all over  
Long after it?s all gone I?ll be yours  
Forever and a day and yours, come anything that may  
You'll always be just everything to me, yeah  
Long after tonight is all over  
Long after tonight is all over  
After it?s over and done, yeah  
After it?s over and done, hey, boy, yeah  
After it?s gone, hey, yeah after it?s gone  

I tried so hard to be carefree  
Rolling out of someone's bed  
Into the sunshine  
But the sun, oh, coming up  
Doesn't always bring the light, oh  
And somehow, somehow I feel, oh  
It's just not right  
No, not for me  
  
Well it's been so long  
Since I've been loved by name, oh-ho  
Love me by name, ah  
Love me by name  
Come on, come on, ooh-hoo  
Love me  
  
Here I feel afraid, ooh  
And I don't know why  
You're surely not the first I've had, ah, oh  
Who held me gently, yeah  
Oh, who took the sweet time  
Just to ask me about me  
Well, well maybe this time  
Oh God, let it be  
Oh, it's such so, so, so long  
Since I've been loved, oh, by name  
  
Love me by name  
Ah, love me by name  
Come on and love me, oh baby  
Yes, love me, aah, aah  
  
Oh, love me by name, oh  
Why don't you love me, ah  
Come on, come on, ahh, ahh  
Sweet baby  
Oh won't you love me, yeah  
Love me by name

When we walk  
Down the street  
We don't care  
Who we see  
Or who we meet  
  
Don't have to run  
Don't have to hide  
'Cause we got something burning inside  
  
We got love power  
It's the greatest power of them all  
We got love power  
And together we can't fall  
  
Sometimes we're up  
Sometimes we're down  
But our feet are always on the ground  
We always laugh  
Don't have to cry  
And this is the reason why  
  
We got love power  
It's the greatest power of them all, hey, hey, hey  
We got love power  
And together we can't fall, hey  
  
Sometimes we're up  
Sometimes we're down  
But our feet are always on the ground  
We always laugh  
Don't have to cry  
And this is the reason why  
  
We got love power  
It's the greatest power in the world  
We got love power  
And together we can't fall  
  
We got love, hey, love power  
It's the greatest feeling of them all, hey, hey, hey  
We got love, oh, power  
And together

I know some lovers would be satisfied  
With sweet, 'I love yous' and some pretty lines  
But that won't get you in this heart of mine  
No, you'll never steal my heart away  
With just words, sweet words that you say  
It is all in the things that you do, I'm telling you  
If you want me to believe that I'm the only one you need  
I need lovin' proof, I need lovin' proof  
(Lovin' proof, lovin' proof)  
Baby, hold me in your arms and show me something from the heart  
Give me lovin' proof, I need lovin' proof from you  
(Oh, baby)  
And if the love you got is strong and true  
And if you love me like you say, you do  
Your tender touch will tell the honest truth  
And your kiss could never tell a lie  
'Cause I'd see it in your eyes  
There is one way to ease any doubt, I tell you now  
If you want me to believe that I'm the only one you need  
I need lovin' proof, I need lovin' proof  
(Lovin' proof, lovin' proof)  
Baby, I won't be impressed unless I get some tenderness  
Give me lovin' proof, I need lovin' proof, oh, oh, from you, oh, oh  
(I need lovin' proof)  
If the love is right  
(I need lovin' proof)  
Prove it, prove it all night  
(I need lovin' proof)  
From you  
'Cause you'll never steal my heart away  
With just words, sweet words that you say  
It is all in the things you do, I'm telling you, telling you, baby  
If you want me to believe that I'm the only one you need  
I need lovin' proof, I need lovin' proof  
(Lovin' proof, lovin' proof)  
Baby, hold me in your arms and tell me something from the heart  
I need lovin' proof, give me lovin' proof, oh, oh, from you  
(Lovin' proof)  
If you want me to believe, I'm the only one you need  
I need lovin' proof, lovin' proof  
(I need lovin' proof)  
Baby, hold me in your arms and show me, show me  
(And tell me something from the heart)  
Give me lovin' proof, I need lovin' proof  
If you want me to believe I'm the only one you need  
I need lovin' proof, lovin' proof  
(Ooh, baby, baby)  
Baby, hold me in your arms and show me something from the heart  
Give me lovin' proof, I need lovin' proof  
(Ooh, ooh, give me, give me, give me)  
If you want me to believe I'm the only one you need  

There is a garden  
Something like the shadow of a butterfly  
And lies beyond the gates of dark and light  
And darling, it belongs to me  
  
And when you go there  
There will be such laughter in the dimpled sky  
The songs you sing  
Will drive away the night  
The magic garden  
Has a way of making you feel free  
  
It's the place I've made for you  
From match-boxes and cards and dominoes  
And it won't fall down  
And when your dreaming vanishes  
Like snowflakes in the summer sky  
Melts away in darkness  
And you don't know why the magic garden  
Waits without the gates wide open  
And darlin', I'll be standin' just inside  
  
And when your dreaming vanishes  
Like snowflakes in the summer sky  
Melts away in darkness  
And you don't know why the magic garden  
Waits without the gates wide open  
And darlin', I'll be standin' just inside  
  
It's so soft and warm  
Behind those hedges  
No hard edges  
No hard edges  
  
There is a garden  
Vanishes like snowflakes in the summer sky  
Melts away in darkness  
And you don't know why the magic garden  
Waits without the gates wide open  
And darlin', I'll be standin' just inside

[Chorus]  
Mama said there'll be days like this  
There'll be days like this, my mama said  
(Mama said, mama said)  
Mama said there'll be days like this  
There'll be days like this, my mama said  
  
I went walkin' the other day, yeah  
Everything was goin' fine  
And then I met a little boy named Billy-Joe  
And then I almost lost my mind, come on  
  
[Chorus]  
  
My eyes were wide open  
All that I could see, yeah  
The chapel bells were tollin'  
For everybody but me  
But I don't worry 'cause  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And then she said  
Someone would look at me  
Like I'm lookin' at you  
One day  
Then I might find  
I don't want you any old way  
  
So, don't worry, 'cause  
Mama said there'll be days like this  
There'll be days like this, my mama said  
(Mama said, mama said)  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Mama said there'll be days like this  
There'll be days like this, my mama said  
Oh, yeah  
(Mama said, mama said)  
  
Don't worry, yeah, don't worry, now, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Don't worry, worry, now, now, now  
Don't you worry

The morning it is sad  
The morning so beautiful  
The sunshine it is sad  
The sunshine no friend of mine  
You awake  
It is day  
As you go from me away  
The morning it is sad  
The morning so beautiful  
So, alone I will stay  
The daylight takes you away  
So I wait 'til good night  
Begins to end the daylight  
The daytime, the daybreak  
The dawning  
Come away, until day  
Come away with me my love  
Come away, until day  
Come away and sing the night  
The morning it is sad  
The morning so beautiful  
The sunshine it is sad  
The sunshine no friend of mine  
You awake it is day  
As you go from me away  
The morning it is sad  
The morning so beautiful  

Morning please don't come  
Surely you see that my lover is sleeping  
Morning please don't come  
Let the night linger on  
When the stars have left the sky  
We must say fond goodbye  
Make the night a little longer  
Morning please don't come  
Starshine glow a little stronger  
Morning please don't come  
Day don't break for you will take  
My love away from me  
Try to hold back the sun  
I beg you morning please don't come  
Sing sweet nightingale  
Sing me a song of a night never-ending  
Sing sweet nightingale  
And I'll try to pretend  
That tomorrow's nowhere near  
And there's nothing to fear  
Make the night a little longer  
Morning please don't come  
Starshine glow a little stronger  
Morning please don't come  
Day don't break for you will take  
My love away from me  
Try to hold back the sun  
I beg you morning please don't come  
Try to hold back the sun  
I beg you morning please don't come  
Try to hold back the sun  
I beg you morning please don't come  

For those who fancy coloring books  
And lots of people do  
Here's a new one for you  
A most unusual coloring book  
The kind you'll never see  
Crayons ready?  
Very well  
Begin to color me  
  
These are the eyes that watched him as he walked away  
Color them grey  
This is the heart that thought he would always be true  
Color it blue  
  
These are the arms that held him and touched him  
Lost him somehow  
Color them empty now  
These are the beads I wore  
Until she came between  
Color them green  
  
This is the room that I sleep in and walk in  
And weep in and hide in  
That nobody, nobody's seen  
Oh, color it lonely, please  
  
This is the man whose love I depended upon  
Color him gone

(Irish folk song sang by Dusty on her TV show in 1967)  
  
Where Lagan stream sings lullaby  
There grows a young man fair  
The twilight gleam is in his eye  
The night is on his hair  
And like a lovesick lenan he  
He hath my heart in thrall  
No life I owe, no liberty  
His love is lord of all  
  
And often when the beetles' horn  
Hath lulled the eve to sleep  
I steal unto his shieling lorn  
And thro' the dooring peep  
There on the cricket's singing stone  
He spears the bird in fire  
And hums in sad, sweet undertone  
The song of his desire

Oh, ho  
He rode into Virginia  
Rollin' thunder, ridin' high  
I was servin' table  
Waitin' for that ride  
My arms around his body  
Well, we rode a thousand miles  
He taught me how to love  
He taught me how to fly, oh, ho, my  
Hungry together  
Racin' the weather  
Into the Natchez Trace  
Warmin' and feedin' him  
All the way to Cumberland, oh, ho, yes  
And I had his child in Memphis  
And we watched him ride away  
And now you know what a girl like me  
Is doin' here today  
I'm sorry mister, you can't stay  
Hungry together  
Racin' the weather  
Into the Natchez Trace  
Warmin' and feedin' him  
All the way to Cumberland, oh, ho, yes  
And when the piper gets to play  
Somebody's got to pay  
And now you know what a girl like me  
Is doin' here today  
Oh, I'm sorry mister, you can't stay  
I'm sorry mister, you can't stay  
Hungry together  
Racin' the weather  
Into the Natchez Trace  
Warmin' and feedin' him  
All the way to Cumberland, oh  
When the piper gets to play  
Somebody's got to pay  
And now you know what a girl like me  
Is doin' here today  
Oh, I'm sorry mister, you can't stay  
I'm sorry mister, you can't stay, oh, ho, ho, ho  
Sorry mister, you can't stay  
Sorry mister, you can't stay, no  
Sorry mister, you can't stay, oh, ho, ho, ho  
Sorry mister, you can't stay  
Sorry mister, you can't stay, no  
Sorry mister, you can't stay, oh  
Sorry mister, sorry mister

Dear Lord above  
I swear that I  
I will never love again  
Unless I'm lovin' him  
Oh, no, oh, oh, oh  
He came to me  
With a twinkle in his eye  
And I fell for him  
Yes, I fell for him  
Took me by surprise  
Unaware was I  
Well I fell for him  
Oh, I fell for him  
If I ever needed help, I need it now  
Ain't none of my so-called friends  
Got the power to make my tears go 'way  
So on my knees I pray  
That you bring his love my way  
Dear Lord above  
I swear that I'll  
Never, never love again  
Oh, no ho

And wipe the tears I cried  
When I fell for him  
Yes, I fell him  
Gettin' next to me  
Was all he wanted to see  
Well goody-good for him  
Goody-good for him  
When my heart's in trouble  
And my mind's in doubt  
You're the only one who could ever work it out  
And bring the sun back in my day  
So on my knees I pray  
That you send his love my way

Said I'm never, never, never, never

No sad songs for me  
Soon our love will be  
Just a memory  
It's all over  
  
I walk around imagining  
The way you'll say goodbye  
And when you try to tell me  
I just hope that I won't cry  
  
No sad songs for me  
Soon our love will be  
Just a memory  
It's all over  
  
The glow has gone forever  
And our dreams have turned to dust  
I don't know how I can go on  
And yet I know I must  
  
No sad songs for me  
Soon our love will be  
Just a memory  
It's all over  
  
It breaks my heart to feel this way  
Although I try to smile  
To think I'll be alone again  
In just a little while  
  
No sad songs for me  
Soon our love will be  
Just a memory  
It's all over  
It's all over  
It's all over

No stranger am I  
You enter my world  
I hear flowers sing  
No emptiness now  
You enter my world  
Hear flowers with me  
Sing joyous  
  
I feel you 'er I sing  
No unending time alone  
  
No stranger am I  
You open my eyes  
I feel laughter ring  
No longer alone  
You open my heart  
Feel laughter with me  
Ring joyous  
  
Indifference gone away  
No unending time alone  
  
Indifference gone away  
No undening time alone

Baby, if a wall of stone were built around your heart  
Oh, don't you know, don't you know?  
I would tear the wall apart  
'Cause nothing, nothing, nothing, I said no, not nothing  
Nothing in the world's gonna keep me away from you  
If a sea of fire, it was surrounding you  
Oh, don't you know, don't you know?  
I would find a way to get through  
Because nothing, nothing, nothing, I said no, not nothing  
Nothing in the world's gonna keep me away from you  
I've been listening, baby  
For one thing, one little thing that I wanna hear  
Come on and tell me, come on tell me  
Do you really, really, really, really want me here?  
Because nothing, nothing, nothing, I said no, not nothing  
Nothing in the world's gonna keep me away from you  
Yeah, I'm listening, baby  
(Nothing in the world's gonna keep me away from you)  
Yeah, I'm listening, baby  
For one thing, for one little thing that I wanna hear  
Come on and tell me, come on and tell me  
Do you really, really, really, really want me here?  
Because nothing, nothing, I said nothing, no, no, not nothing  
Nothing in the world's gonna keep me away from you  
Oh, I said nothing, I said nothing, I said nothing, no, no, no, no, not
nothing  
Nothing in the world's gonna keep me away from you  
Yeah, yeah  

Mandy's in the papers 'cause she tried to go to spain  
She'll soon be in the dock and in the papers once again  
Vicki's got her story about the mirror and the cane  
It may be false, it may be true  
But nothing has been proved  
  
Stephen's in his dressing-gown now, breakfasting alone  
Too sick to eat, he's on his feet and to the telephone  
The police inspector soothes him with his sympathetic tone  
It may be false, it may be true  
But nothing has been proved  
  
In the house a resignation  
Guilty faces, every one  
Christine's fallen out with lucky  
Johnny's got a gun  
"Please Please Me"'s number one  
  
(It's a scandal! it's a scandal! such a scandal!)  
Now, Stephen's in the dock for spending money that was earned  
By Christine, and the prosecution says that money burned  
A hole in Stephen's pocket, for expensive sins he yearned  
It may be false, it may be true  
But nothing has been proved  
  
In the news the suicide note  
In the court an empty space  
Even Mandy's looking worried  
Christine's pale and drawn  
"Please Please Me"'s number one  
  
(it's a scandal! it's a scandal! such a scandal!)  
Last night he wrote these words to his friend:  
"Sorry about the mess  
I'm guilty 'til proved innocent  
In the public eye and press"  
The funeral's very quiet because all his friends have fled  
They may be false, they may be true  
They've all got better things to do  
They may be false, they may be true  
But nothing has been proved  
Nothing  
Nothing has been proved  
Oh, nothing  
Nothing  
Oh, nothing  
Nothing  
Oh, nothing

Nothing is forever  
Always is a dream  
Life goes by so fast  
You try to make it last  
The future turns to past  
And summer turns to snow  
Ohhh  
Ohhh  
  
Nothing is forever  
I will understand  
If you want me for tonight  
Just come and hold me tight  
And with the morning light  
If summer turns to snow  
You can go  
Ohhh  
Ohhh  
  
Now here I am wanting you  
Yes here I am wanting to  
  
For a lifetime or a day  
Or just the month of May  
Well, it's easier to stay  
Knowing you can go  
Ohhh  
Ohhh  
  
And nothing is forever  
Nothing is forever

(Gilbert O'Sullivan)  
  
If I give up this seat I've been saving  
To some elderly lady or man  
Am I being a good girl?  
Am I still your sweet pearl?  
Mother please, if you're pleased, say I am  
  
And if, while in the course of my duty,  
I perform an unfortunate take  
Would you punish me so, unbelievably so?  
Never again would I make that mistake  
This feeling inside me  
Can never deny me  
The right to be wrong if I choose  
And the pleasure I get from, say,  
Winning a bet  
Is to lose  
  
When I'm drinking my Bonaparte shandy  
Eating more than enough apple pies  
Would I glance in my screen  
And see real human beings  
Starve to death right in front of my eyes?  
  
Nothing old, nothing new  
Nothing ventured, nothing gained  
Nothing stillborn or lost  
Nothing further than proof  
Nothing older than you  
Nothing sweeter than wine  
Nothing older than time  
Nothing physically, recklessly, hopelessly blind  
Nothing I couldn't say  
Nothing why?  
'Cause today nothing rhymed, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  
  
Yeah, this feeling inside me  
Can never deny me  
The right to be wrong if I choose  
The pleasure I get from, say  
Winning a bet  
Is to lose  
  
Nothing good, nothing bad  
Nothing ventured, nothing gained  
Nothing stillborn or lost  
Nothing further than proof  
Nothing wilder than you  
Nothing sweeter than wine  
Nothing older than time  
Nothing physically, hopelessly, recklessly, blind  
Nothing I couldn't say  
Nothing why?  
'Cause today nothing rhymed, ooh, oh, oh, oh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh  
Nothing rhymed

Of all the things I've ever done  
Finding you will prove to be  
The most important one  
I would never trade the tears  
The conversation no-one hears  
The learning how to walk before we run  
  
Of all the kites I ever flew  
Most came tumbling down  
Except the one I sent up with you  
I don't want to change a thing  
Break the spell  
Cut the string  
When every wish I made is coming true  
With you  
  
Sometimes I forget  
To say how much I love you  
Purposely I bet  
'Cause I'm so busy thinking of you  
  
So, in this world of odds and ends  
I'd rather have a part of you  
Than all of my so-called friends  
You have taught me how to feel  
What is false and what is real  
Of all the things I ever want to do  
I think I'll start and end with loving you  
  
Oh, you have taught me how to feel  
What is false and what is real  
Of all the things I ever want to do  
I think I'll start and end with loving you

It's my decision  
You look my way  
With innocent expression  
Just as if to say  
It would be easy  
The mood is right  
Forget for just one moment  
Who we are tonight  
I start  
To weaken the music's strong  
My conscience speaks, I know it's wrong  
  
[Chorus]  
Give it up  
Remember what you said  
This kind of loving doesn't happen everyday  
Give it up  
That's the way it starts  
Discover old habits die hard  
Temptation makes a fool out of us all  
  
I made my mind up  
It had to end  
So why this indecision?  
When you're close again  
Oh, the thought's appealing  
I can't deny  
With those old memories stealing  
Back across my mind  
I thought by now that the flame had gone  
I realize that I'm still holding on  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'll just keep holding on  
It's easier said than done  
  
(Old habits die hard)  
Give it up  
Remember what you said  
This kind of loving doesn't happen everyday, no  
Give it up  
That's the way it starts  
Discover old habits die hard  
Give it up  
Remember what you said  
This kind of loving doesn't happen everyday, no  
Give it up  
That's the way it starts  
Discover old habits die hard  
Give it up  
Remember what you said  
This kind of loving doesn't happen everyday  
Give it up  
That's the way it starts  
Discover old habits die hard

When you passed my way  
It seemed my lucky day  
The world was oh-so fine  
Once upon a time  
  
We walked for a little while  
You smiled that special smile  
And when we said goodnight  
You held me oh-so tight  
  
Then you found someone new  
And I spent my nights alone  
'Cause now we're through  
There's nothing I can do  
I gotta say forget...  
Forget him, forget him  
'Cause he's no good, no, no  
  
Now, when you pass my way  
I guess I'll smile and say  
To think that boy was mine  
Once upon a time  
  
To think that boy was mine  
Once upon a time  
Once upon a time  
Woh, oh, once upon a time  
No, no, no, no, no, once upon a time

So if I give up (yes, I'm packin' up)  
Movin' out of the town (movin' out of the town)  
Packin' up (yes, I'm packin' up)  
Movin' out of the town (movin' out of the town)  
I'm not chained and I'm no longer bound  
Said if I get up (yes, I'm packin' up)  
Movin' out of the town (movin' out of town)  
Oh yeah (yes, I'm packin' up)  
Movin' out of the town (movin' out of the town)  
I'm not chained and I'm no longer bound  
My suitcase's ready  
My clothes are too  
And these are the things  
You took me through  
My friends told me  
All about you  
That men are evil  
The things you do  
And I keep on (I'm not chained and I'm no longer bound)  
And then I'm packin' (yes, I'm packin' up)  
Movin' out of the town (movin' out of the town)  
Oh yeah (yes, I'm packin' up)  
Movin' out of the town (movin' out of the town)  
I'm not chained and I'm no longer bound  
Now that I'm gone  
Just look at me  
I'm looking better than  
Any girl you see  
I've gotta brand new clothes  
I gotta diamond ring  
I gotta brand new man  
He give me everything  
So keep on (I'm not chained and I'm no longer bound)  
And then I'm movin' (movin' movin')  
Oh, movin' (movin' movin')  
And I gotta move (movin' movin')  
And I wanna move (movin' movin')  
Oh yeah (movin' movin')  
And I gotta move (movin' movin')  
And I gotta move (movin' movin')  
And I gotta move (movin' movin')  
Start packin' up (movin' movin')  
Start packin' up (movin' movin')  
Start packin' up (movin' movin')  
Movin' out of town (movin' movin')  
Alright (movin' movin')  
Yeah, yeah (movin' movin')  
Start packin' up (movin' movin')  

I am a poor, wayfaring stranger  
Wandering o'er this world of woe  
And there's no sickness, toil or danger  
In that bright land to which I go  
I'm going home to see my father  
I'm going home, no more to roam  
I'm only going over Jordan  
I'm only going over home  
I know dark clouds will gather round me  
I know my way is rough and steep  
But beautious fields lie just before me  
Where men redeemed their vigil's keep  
I'm going home to see my mother  
I'm going there, no more to roam  
I'm only going over Jordan  
I'm only going over home  

Quiet please, there's a lady on stage  
She may not be the latest rage  
But she's singing and she means it  
And she deserves a little silence  
  
Quiet please, there's a woman up there  
And she's been honest through her songs  
Long before your consciousness was raised  
Doesn't that deserve a little praise  
  
So put your hands together and help her along  
All that's left of the singer's  
All that's left of the song  
Stand for the ovation  
And give her one last celebration  
  
Quiet please, there's a person up there  
And she's been singing of the things  
That none of us could bear to hear for ourselves  
Give her your respect if nothing else  
  
Quiet please, there's a lady on stage  
Conductor, turn the final page  
And when it's over we can all go home  
But she lives on -- on the stage alone.

Somebody got a magic touch  
Somebody just can't get enough  
Your picture's hanging in my car  
I love you for just who you are  
  
And don't you know I want you?, maybe  
Baby  
  
Get your motor running  
Can't you hear me coming?  
And send it to me  
Put it in a letter  
If that'll make it better  
And send it to me, haa  
Stick it in a bottle  
It's always getting hotter  
And send it to me, haa  
Nothing gonna stop it  
So shoot it like a rocket  
And send it to me  
  
I sit behind a desk all day  
And dream of you to get away  
I got no money in the bank  
I don't need much, got you to thank  
  
And don't you know I want you?, maybe  
Baby  
  
Oh, get your motor running  
Can't you hear me coming?  
And send it to me, ah  
Put it in a letter  
If that'll make it better  
And send it to me, haa  
Stick it in a bottle  
It's always getting hotter  
Send it to me, haa  
Nothing gonna stop it  
So shoot it like a rocket  
And send it to me, ahh  
  
Deep in the night, I turn around  
And wish you were here with me  
I grab the sheets and make up a fantasy  
Can't you see  
That you're the one that I love?  
  
Get your motor running  
Can't you hear me coming?  
And send it to me, ooh, oh, oh  
Stick it in a bottle  
Ain't nothing gonna stop it  
So shoot it like a rocket  
Baby, send it to me  
Ahh, oh  
Get your motor running  
Can't you hear me coming?  
And sent it to me, ah, ho

Such a silly, silly, silly, silly fool am I  
Oh, I, just a silly, silly, silly, silly fool am I  
  
Hey, I should have never fallen  
Back in love with you  
Knowin' how you get a pleasure  
Breaking my poor heart in two  
You made it sound so convincin'  
When you said  
"I'm your woman, you're my man"  
Now I really need you  
And I sit here a loser again  
  
I guess I'm just a silly, silly, silly, silly fool am I, oh I  
I'm such a silly, silly, silly, silly, fool am I, mmm  
  
I should have never trusted  
In my heart to lead the way  
Now my mind is all busted  
That's a fool's price to pay  
  
You made it sound so convincin'  
When you said you'd never, never go away  
I should have never listened  
To anything you had to say  
  
I'm such a silly, silly, silly, silly, silly, silly fool am I, yes I am  
I'm such a silly, silly, silly, silly fool am I, oh  
Such a silly, silly, dilly, silly, dilly fool am I, oh yeah  
I'm such a silly, silly, silly, silly, silly fool am I, oh yes I am  
I'm such a silly, silly, dilly, silly, dilly, silly fool am I, oh yeah  
I'm such a silly, dilly, silly, dilly, silly fool am I, oh  
Silly, dilly
