I watch you sleeping  
My weary heart rises up on wings  
I hear your laughter  
Something deep down inside me sings  
  
Way down here in the land of cotton  
You were born on a rainy day  
Since then, sweet things long forgotten  
They just keep flooding back my way  
  
Oh child, I cannot tell you how the time just flies  
But I have had my days of glory under sunny skies  
These days, your bright dreams are all I want to see  
Sleep tight, Annabel  
You can always count on me  
  
In this cold world, folks will judge you  
Though they don't know you at all  
And I may not be there to catch you  
Anytime that you might fall  
  
But, you got my hard head  
And your mother's grace  
All the likeness of the loved ones right there in your face  
And I know in the end you'll be who you will be  
  
So sleep tight, Annabel  
You can always count on me

Did I lose your love a long time ago  
Or did I just wear it out? Baby, I don't know  
Seems like anymore we're not on the same page  
In the same book, or on the same stage  
  
We say the words, but they feel all wrong  
Like a happy blues, like a sad love song  
How two people can bow and scrape  
For every shred of tenderness  
  
Can love stand the test  
Of times that surround us  
Memories that astound us  
Joy and happiness  
Can love stand the test?  
  
A long time ago, or was it just yesterday  
Why would we fall out of love? Baby, can you say?  
Don't look at me like I'm stranger now  
Have I changed that much? Baby, tell me how  
How two people could bow and scrape  
For every shred of tenderness  
  
Can love stand the test  
Of times that surround us  
Memories that astound us  
Joy and happiness  
Can love stand the test?  
  
We said forever, for always, for good  
But the years were not impressed  
  
Can love stand the test  
Of time that surrounds us  
Moments that astound us?  
Can love stand the test  
Of time that surrounds us  
Moments that astound us?  
Joy and happiness  
Joy and happiness  
Joy and happiness

I'm gonna love you, like nobody's loved you  
Come rain or come shine  
High as a mountain, deep as a river  
Come rain or come shine  
I guess when you met me  
It was just one of those things  
But don't you ever bet me  
'Cause I'm gonna be true if you let me  
You're gonna love me, like nobody's loved me  
Come rain or come shine  
We'll be happy together, unhappy together  
Now won't that be just fine  
The days may be cloudy or sunny  
We're in or out of the money  
But I'm with you always  
I'm with you rain or shine

Maybe just a good night's sleep  
Would have changed your troubled mind  
From that rather permanent decision  
So tragic, so unkind  
Now, pain is what you've given  
And sleep is what you'll get  
So far away from that sweet baby child  
Who hardly knew you yet  
  
Now he'll grow up to be a fighter  
Full of anger, full of shame  
Like all the other haunted children  
Who wonder why they came  
And he'll be in and out of trouble  
Until he stands up or he falls  
But there will always be a shadow there  
No matter how it goes  
Damn it, Rose  
  
Is this another cryptic message  
Or some kind of cosmic quiz  
If there's a lesson to be learned from this  
Well, I don't know what it is  
  
You could have given us the finger  
Much more constructively than that  
Now I sit here with the MTV  
And your bloated, Burmese cat  
We're being treated to the wisdom  
Of some puffed up little fart  
Doing exactly what I used to do  
Pretensions to anarchy and art  
He speaks the language of a warrior  
He mounts his misinformed attack  
He wears the clothes of a dissenter  
But there's a logo on his back  
And it's a hollow rebellion  
As rebellions mostly are  
It's just another raging tempest in a jar  
  
And the seasons keep on changing  
And the wind blows hot and cold  
Wish that you were here with us to watch this tide  
As it ebbs and flows  
Damn it, Rose

I make my living off the evening news  
Just give me something-something I can use  
People love it when you lose,  
They love dirty laundry  
  
Well, I coulda been an actor, but I wound up here  
I just have to look good, I don't have to be clear  
Come and whisper in my ear  
Give us dirty laundry  
  
Kick 'em when they're up  
Kick 'em when they're down  
Kick 'em when they're up  
Kick 'em when they're down  
Kick 'em when they're up  
Kick 'em when they're down  
Kick 'em when they're up  
Kick 'em all around  
  
We got the bubble-headed-bleach-blond who  
Comes on at five  
She can tell you 'bout the plane crash with a gleam  
In her eye  
It's interesting when people die  
Give us dirty laundry  
  
Can we film the operation?  
Is the head dead yet?  
You know, the boys in the newsroom got a  
Running bet  
Get the widow on the set!  
We need dirty laundry  
  
You don't really need to find out what's going on  
You don't really want to know just how far it's gone  
Just leave well enough alone  
Eat your dirty laundry  
  
Kick 'em when they're up  
Kick 'em when they're down  
Kick 'em when they're up  
Kick 'em when they're down  
  
Kick 'em when they're up  
Kick 'em when they're down  
Kick 'em when they're stiff  
Kick 'em all around  
  
Dirty little secrets  
Dirty little lies  
We got our dirty little fingers in everybody's pie  
We love to cut you down to size  
We love dirty laundry  
  
We can do "The Innuendo"  
We can dance and sing  
When it's said and done we haven't told you a thing  
We all know that crap is king  
Give us dirty laundry!

Everybody knows that the dice are loaded  
Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed  
Everybody knows the war is over  
Everybody knows the good guys lost  
Everybody knows the fight was fixed  
The poor stay poor, and the rich get rich  
That's how it goes  
And everybody knows  
  
Everybody knows the boat is leaking  
Everybody knows the captain lied  
Everybody got this broken feeling  
Like their father or their dog just died  
Everybody talkin' into their pockets  
Everybody wants a box of chocolates  
And a long stemmed rose  
Everybody knows  
  
Everybody knows  
Everybody knows  
That's how it goes  
Everybody knows  
  
Everybody knows that you love me baby  
Everybody knows that you really do  
Everybody knows that you've been faithful  
Give or take a night or two  
Everybody knows you've been discrete  
There were so many people you just had to meet  
Without your clothes  
But everybody knows  
  
Everybody knows that it's now or never  
Everybody knows that it's me or you  
Everybody knows that you live forever  
When you've done a line or two  
Everybody knows the deal is rotten  
Oh, by Joe still pickin' cotton  
For your ribbons and bows  
Everybody knows  
  
Everybody knows  
Everybody knows  
That's how it goes  
Everybody knows  
  
Everybody knows  
Everybody knows  
That's how it goes  
Everybody knows  
  
Everybody knows that the plague is coming  
Everybody knows it moving fast  
Everybody knows that's the naked man and woman  
Just a shining artifact of the past  
And everybody knows that the scene is dead  
But there's gonna be a meter on your bed  
That will disclose  
What everybody knows  
  
Everybody knows that you're in trouble  
Everybody knows what you've been through  
From the bloody cross on  
To the beach at Malibu  
Everybody knows it's coming apart  
Take one last look at this sacred heart  
Before it blows  
And everybody knows  
  
Everybody knows  
Everybody knows  
That's how it goes  
Everybody knows  
  
Everybody knows  
Everybody knows  
That's how it goes  
Everybody knows  
  
Everybody knows  
Everybody knows  
That's how it goes  
Everybody knows  
  
Everybody knows  
Everybody knows  
That's how it goes  
Everybody knows

Baby picks off your plate--yours look's better  
And she throws hers on the floor  
Here, in the home of the brave  
And the land of the free  
The first word that baby learns is more  
  
So you're out there floating like a big, puffy cloud  
With the pool and the charcoal  
And the kids and the wife  
Til the reruns of your dreams are interrupted  
And you step out into life  
  
And it's still gimme, gimme what you got  
Gimme, gimme what you got  
I said gimme, gimme what you got  
(I want it, I want it)  
Gimme, gimme what you got  
  
Now it's take and take takeover, takeover  
It's all take and never give  
All these trumped up towers  
They're just golden showers  
Where are people supposed to live?  
  
You can arm yourself, alarm yourself  
But there's nowhere you can run  
'Cause a man with a briefcase  
Can steal more money  
Than any man with a gun  
  
I said gimme, gimme what you got  
Said gimme, gimme what you got  
Gimme, gimme what you got  
Gimme, gimme what you got  
  
You got the price of admission--  
You don't have to ask permission  
To take somethin' from another man  
You cross a lawyer with the godfather, baby  
Make you an offer that you can't understand  
  
From Main Street to Wall Street to Washington  
From men to women to men  
It's a nation of noses pressed up against the glass  
They've seen it on the TV  
And they want it pretty fast  
  
You spend your whole life  
Just pilin' it up there  
You got stacks and stacks and stacks  
Then, Gabriel comes and taps you on the shoulder  
But you don't see no hearses with luggage racks  
  
Gimme, gimme what you got  
I said gimme, gimme what you got  
I said gimme, gimme what you got  
(I want it, I want it)  
Gimme, gimme what you got

You're leavin' tongue marks on the carpet  
And I know what you're lookin' at  
You would walk on your lips through busted glass  
If you could get next to that  
  
You think this is love  
Your education starts today  
So you think this is love?  
So tell me  
How bad do you want it?  
How bad do you want it?  
How bad do you want it?  
Not bad enough  
  
So you put a hold on happiness  
... a day, a week, a year  
You got to bring somethin' to this party, boy  
If you party here  
  
And if you're lookin' for love  
You better look some other way  
If you're lookin' for love  
I have to ask you  
How bad do you want it?  
How bad do you want it?  
How bad do you want it?  
Not bad enough  
  
She gave you love and affection  
Enough to weather any season  
You found an excuse to walk away  
But you didn't find no reason  
  
And you talk about love  
But you don't know what it means  
Yeah, you talk about love  
So tell me  
How bad do you want it?  
How bad do you want it?  
How bad do you want it?  
Not bad enough

I know you love me  
You know I love you too  
You know I always will  
No matter what you do  
  
You say you haven't got another lover  
You say you only want to make the scene  
Then you try to keep it under cover  
What does that mean?  
  
And baby, I can't stand still (while he's holding you)  
I can't stand (while he's kissing you)  
  
So we got a little problem, baby:  
How to put together love and work  
If I could figure out that one, darlin'  
I could save us from a world of hurt  
  
I remember when we walked together  
Makin' love on a summer night  
Guess we thought that it would last forever  
We were all right  
  
But baby, I can't stand still (while he's holding you)  
I can't stand still (while he's touching you)  
  
I can take it if you need some freedom  
Understand it if you miss your friends  
Don't you ever try to think of me some  
You never tell me where you've been  
  
You say you haven't got another lover  
You say you only want to make the scene  
Then you try to keep it under cover  
What does that mean?  
  
And baby, I can't stand still (while he's holding you)  
I can't stand still (while he's kissing you)  
And baby, I can't stand still (while he's holding you)  
I can't stand still (while he's touching you)  
I can't stand still

Walkin' like a millionaire  
Smilin' like a king  
He leaned his shopping cart against the wall  
He said, "I been a lot of places  
And I seen a lot of things  
But, sonny, I seen one thing that beats 'em all  
I was flyin' back from Lubbock  
I saw Jesus on the plane...or maybe it was Elvis  
You know, they kinda look the same  
Hey, look out, Junior, you're steppin' on my bed"  
I said, "I don't see nothin"  
He just glared at me and said,  
If dirt were dollars  
If dirt were dollars  
If dirt were dollars  
I wouldn't worry anymore  
Lookin' like a beauty queen  
Loyal as a wife  
She raised her little voice and testified,  
"I am a good girlI've been one all my life"  
But her virtue was as swollen as her pride  
She should've had the Oscar  
She must have been miscast  
Her fifteen minutes went by so fast  
I said, "Now, baby, have you got no shame?"  
She just looked at me, uncomprehendingly  
Like cows at a passing trainIf dirt were dollars  
If dirt were dollars  
If dirt were dollars  
I wouldn't worry anymore  
We got the bully pulpit  
And the poisoned pen  
We got a press no better  
Than the public men  
This brave new world  
Gone bad again  
God's finest little creatures  
Looking brave and strong  
Whistling past the graveyard  
Nothing can go wrong  
Quoting from the scriptures  
With patriotic tears  
We got the same old men  
With the same old fears  
Standing at attention  
Wrapped in stars and stripes  
They hear the phantom drummers  
And the nonexistent pipes  
These days the buck stops nowhere  
No one takes the blame  
But evil is still evilIn anybody's name  
If dirt were dollarsIf dirt were dollars  
If dirt were dollars  
We'd all be in the black  

Well, it's up in the mornin'  
Everybody off and runnin'  
Everybody got some place to be  
Some people never go walkin'  
Some people just stop talkin'  
And I was slippin' away  
You came and pulled me through  
I want to stay in the land of the living with you  
  
I want to stay in the land of the living  
I want to stay here with you  
I want to stay in the land of the living  
I want to stay here with you  
  
We work and we worry  
This old world's in such a hurry  
So many things we just don't see  
Some people always cryin'  
Some people just stop tryin'  
And I was slippin' away  
You came and pulled me though  
I want to stay in the land of the living with you  
  
We got to do what we can about all this pain and sorrow  
But try to live just a little  
We could all be gone tomorrow  
When I look at you girl, my heart rejoices  
You taught me somethin':  
Considering the choices  
  
I want to stay in the land of the living  
I want to stay here with you  
I want to stay in the land of the living  
I want to stay here with you

Like every young man, I had some things that I  
Wanted to say  
Ere I could begin, you know the world got  
In my way  
  
Oh Lilah, to sleep like a baby  
To open the window and reel the fair wind  
Oh Lilah, to sleep like a baby again  
We spend so much time weeping and wailing and  
  
Shaking our fists  
Creating enemies that really don't exist  
Oh Lilah, to sleep like a baby-  
To open the window and feel the fair wind  
  
Oh Lilah, to sleep like a baby again  
All these comings and goings that cut like a knife  
These small, simple pleasures that make up a life  
A man needs a home, and a child, and a wife  
  
To always be there-always  
After I'm gone, there are some things that I know  
I will miss:  
The taste of your mouth, the smell of the perfume  
  
On your wrist Oh, Lilah, the fields lie fallow  
What are ye sow, so shall ye reap  
Oh Lilah, this ground we hallow  
Is ours to tend, but not to keep  
  
Too-rah, loo-rah, loo-rah Lilah  
Too-rah, loo-rah, loo-rah lay  
Now, while all the streets are silent  
Take my hand and come away

Oh, it's cold and lonely here-  
Here in this telephone booth  
There's three sides to every story:  
Yours and mine and the cold, hard truth  
I think there's something missing 'round here  
I don't know where it's gone  
But it's a long way back home  
  
The heat don't work  
The toaster don't work  
The car don't work  
And I guess I know why  
This house don't work and this dream don't  
Work no more  
And lover, neither do you and I  
I fall asleep with the colors flying  
Over sand and foam  
But it's a long way back home  
  
And it's a long way back home  
And it's a long way back home  
It's a long way back home

Every day you pass her in the hall  
You just pretend that you don't see her at all  
You want to tell her how much you care  
You want to call her but you just don't dare  
Love rules  
Love rules  
  
Out in the parking lot with all the guys  
Don't ever let them see the tears in your eyes  
She's got a date tonight and it ain't you  
So you go out there and you get one too  
Love rules  
Love rules  
Love rules  
Love rules  
  
You wish you didn't have so much to feel  
It's much too scary and it's all too real  
All your friends are out having fun  
Sometimes you think that you're the only one that  
Love rules  
Oh, love rules  
  
While everybody's out making time  
You can't help thinking you're the last in line  
She's the finest thing you've ever seen  
You wrap your arms around her in your dreams  
When she smiles it brings you to your knees  
You want to tell her but you always freeze  
She's in the backseat but you're much too shy  
You'd give the world to be an older guy  
Love rules  
Love rules  
Love rules  
Yeah, love still rules  
Love rules  
Love rules...  

I went out in the darkness  
Just searching for someplace to be  
Wasn't looking for trouble  
I guess it was looking for me  
And I knew I was wasting my time  
But it was nobody's business  
Nobody's business but mine  
I was taking some comfort  
I needed a break from the rain  
I guess I was mistaken  
And someone remembered my name  
But I knew I was doin' just fine  
And it was nobody's business  
Nobody's business but mine  
Well I guess for some  
Revenge is sweet  
Though it be once removed  
I hope you feel better  
I don't know what you proved  
Well, yonder comes the Emperor, boys  
He sure looks fine in blue  
I hope you feel better, babe  
I know you're scared too  
Well it sure makes you wonder  
The things that some people will say  
They can see black and white but they  
Don't seem to notice the gray  
What a price for a victimless crime  
When it was nobody's business  
Nobody's business but mine  
Yeah, it was nobody's business  
Nobody's business but mine

Sometimes I wonder where it is love goes  
I don't know if even Heaven knows  
But I know you had some dreams that didn't quite come true  
Now I'm not the one, little girl, who's keeping you  
  
I was either standing in your shadow or  
Blocking your light  
Though I kept on trying I could not make it right  
For you girl  
There's just not enough love in the world  
  
I know people hurt you, so bad  
They don't know the damage they can do,  
And it makes me so sad  
How we knock each other down just like  
Children on a playground  
Even after that ol' sun went down  
  
I was either standing in your shadow or  
Or blocking your light  
Though I kept on trying I could not make it right  
For you girl  
There's just not enough love in the world  
  
Oh darlin', baby, this is still a shady little town  
And sometimes it's so hard to smile  
For the world, for the camera  
And still have something left  
You don't have to prove nothin' to nobody  
Just take good care of yourself  
  
I'm not easy to live with  
I know that it's true  
You're no picnic either, babe  
That's one of the things I loved about you  
Time will come around when we need to settle down  
Got to get of this merry-go-round  
  
I was either standing in your shadow or  
Blocking you're light  
Though I kept on trying I could not make it right  
For you girl  
There's just not enough love in the world  
For you girl  
There's just not enough love in the world  
Not enough love in the world  
In the world  
In the world  
In the world

It's a mighty world we live in  
But the truth is we're only passin' thru  
  
I have stood up on the mountain  
I have seen the other side  
I have wrestled with the devil  
I have wrestled with my pride  
  
I have been down in the valley  
Stood out in the rain  
I have seen my love forsaken  
Felt the pleasure and the pain  
  
If there's one thing that's for certain  
Yes, one chord that rings true  
It's a mighty world we live in  
But the truth is we're only passin' thru  
  
I have cried in tears of sadness  
Cried in tears of joy  
I have found a life worth livin'  
From the peace within the noise  
  
I have turned my back on hatred  
Lyin', prejudice and greed  
Found the future in the present  
Found hope within a seed  
  
If there's one thing that's for certain  
There's one chord that rings true  
It's a mighty world we live in  
But the truth is we're only passin' thru  
  
Passin' thru, passin' thru  
It's a mighty world we live in  
But the truth is we're only passin' thru  
  
I have seen my bucket empty  
Seen my well run dry  
But there's water down the road  
And I'm only goin' by  
  
If I'm settin' on dead ready  
When my chances come to knock  
I'll make it where I'm going  
Standin' tall just like a rock  
  
If there's one thing that's for certain  
There's one chord that rings true  
It's a wicked world we live in  
But the truth is we're only passin' thru  
  
Passin' thru, passin' thru  
It's a mighty world we live in  
But the truth is we're only passin' thru  
Yeah, it's a mighty world we live in  
But the truth is we're only passin' thru  
  
I have stood up on the mountain  
I have seen the other side  
I have wrestled with the devil  
I have wrestled with my pride  
  
I have been down in the valley  
I have stood out in the rain  
I have seen my love forsaken  
Felt the pleasure and the pain  
  
I have cried in tears of sadness  
I have cried in tears of joy  
I have found a life worth livin'

Standin' tall just like a rock  
  
Passin' thru, passin' thru  
It's a mighty world we live in  
But the truth is we're only passin' thru  
Passin' thru, passin' thru

She says her love for me can never die  
But that'd change if she ever found out about you and I  
Oh, but her love is cold  
It wouldn't hurt her if she didn't know  
Cause when it gets too much  
I need to feel your touch  
  
I'm gonna run to you  
I'm gonna run to you  
Cause when the feelin's right I'm gonna run all night  
I'm gonna run to you  
  
She's got a heart of gold, she'd never let me down  
But your the woman always turns me on, you keep me commin' round  
I know her love is true, but it's so damn easy makin' love to you  
I've got my mind made up  
I need to feel your touch  
  
I'm gonna run to you  
Yeah, I'm gonna run to you  
Cause when the feelin's right I'm gonna stay all night

Yeah, I'm gonna run to you  
Oh, when the feelin's right I'm gonna run all night  
I'm gonna run to you  
  
Oh, I'm gonna run to you

Cause when the feelin's right I'm gonna stay all night  
I'm gonna run to you  
  
Oh, I'm gonna run to you  
Yeah, when the feelin's right I'm gonna stay all night  
  
Oh, when the feelin's right, now  
Oh yeah, when the feelin's right, now  
I'm gonna run to you (Oh oh)  
  
Yeah, I'm gonna run to you  
Yeah, now....

Darkness in the morning  
Shadows on the land  
Certain individuals  
Aren't sticking with the plan  
  
And I'm searching for a heart  
Searching everyone  
They say love conquers all  
You can't start it like a car  
You can't stop it with a gun  
  
Leaving in the evening  
Traveling at night  
Staying inconspicuous  
I'm staying out of sight  
  
And I'm searching for a heart  
Searching everyone  
They say love conquers all  
You can't start it like a car  
You can't stop it with a gun  
  
They tell you love requires a little standing in line  
And I've been waiting for you lover for a long, long time  
I've been pacing the floor, I've been watching the door  
Meanwhile I'll keep searching for a heart  
  
I've been searching high and low for you  
Trying to track you down  
Certain individuals  
Have finally come around  
  
And I'm searching for a heart  
Searching everyone  
They say love conquers all  
You can't start it like a car  
You can't stop it with a gun  
  
They tell you love requires a little standing in line  
And I've been waiting for you lover for a long, long time  
I've been pacing the floor, I've been watching that door  
Meanwhile I'll keep searching for a heart  
  
Searching everyone  
They say love conquers all  
You can't start it like a car  
You can't stop it with a gun  
  
They say love conquers all  
You can't start it like a car  
You can't stop it with a gun  
Searching for a heart

Lady luck and four leaf clovers  
Won't ease this hurt I feel all over  
My life was one special occasion  
'Til your leaving dampened the situation  
  
[Chorus:]  
Well well well  
Standing on shakey ground  
Ever since you put me down  
Standing on shakey ground  
Ever since you put me down  
  
My car got repossessed this morning  
Harder times I haven't seen in years  
Girl you better throw me a life preserver  
'Cause I'm about to drown in my own tears  
  
[Chorus x 2]  
  
Standing on shakey ground  
Ever since you put me down  
  
Well well well  
Standing on shakey ground  
Shaking, shakey ground  
Standing, standing  
Standing on shakey ground

Every day's a new day  
That's what I've been told  
Try to hold your head high  
The world runs hot and cold  
  
It's hard to follow footprints  
in the shifting sand  
Another thirsty rider  
Behind the caravan  
  
You had no idea  
just what was waiting out there  
You never thought you'd carry the weight  
of the world  
On your pretty blond hair  
  
This ain't no Shangri-La  
To you, no Shangri-La  
This ain't no Shangri-La  
Nobody knows no Shangri-La  
  
Hey! There's a whole lotta people  
wonderin' who you are  
They think you walk without a care in the world  
But they've been wrong so far  
  
This ain't no Shangri-La  
To you, no Shangri-La  
This ain't no Shangri-La  
Nobody knows no Shangri-La  
  
No one can decide  
What we all must outrun  
Who's gonna carry the weight of the world  
Until we learn to stop  
and do what must be done?  
  
This ain't no Shangri-La  
To you, no Shangri-La  
This ain't no Shangri-La  
Nobody Knows no Shangri-La

Well she got up every morning and she waited in the cold  
Got on the stinking yellow school bus and did what she was told  
And she stared out the window, all the way down to high school.  
She went to home economics just like all the other girls  
  
Making chicken a la king and peanut butter swirls  
But she knew in her heart there had to be something better somewhere.  
Well the boys in the school, they were just a bunch of fools  
And they acted like a bunch of bad bumpkins.  
  
But she went out with this guy 'cause she knew a girl's gotta do something.  
He showed her pictures of his car (pictures of his car!),  
Pictures of his room (pictures of his room!)  
Ohhhh, she's on the zoom, she's on the zoom.  
  
She wasn't meant to stick around here, and be some quarterback's wife  
She wasn't meant to stick around here, be barefoot and pregnant the rest  
of her life...  
Well she got up every morning and she waited in the cold  
  
Got on the stinking yellow cab, put the money through the hole  
And she stared out the window, all the way down Fifth Avenue.  
She went on all the cattle calls just like all the other girls  
And she waited by the phone in her rollers and her curls  
  
But she knew in her heart there had to be something better.  
Well she ran into this guy who was down at 54  
Had a lot of gold and chains and he got her in the door,  
And he knew so many people, and he made her lots of pretty promises.  
  
He showed her pictures of his car (pictures of his car!),  
Pictures of his room (pictures of his room!)  
Ohhhh, she's on the zoom, she's on the zoom.  
He showed her pictures of his car (pictures of his car!),  
  
Pictures of his room (pictures of his room!)  
Ohhhh, she's on the zoom, she's on the zoom.  
Ohhhh, she's on the zoom, she's on the zoom.

I dreamed last night  
I was on the boat to heaven  
By some chance  
I had brought my dice along  
And there I stood  
And I hollered someone fade me  
But the passengers they knew right from wrong  
  
And the people all said sit down  
Sit down you're rockin the boat  
The people all said sit down  
Sit down you're rockin the boat  
Cause the devil will drag you under  
By the sharp lapels of your checkered coat  
Sit down Sit down  
Sit down you're rockin the boat  
Oooh Oooh Oooh (scat)  
Oooh Oooh Oooh  
  
As I sailed  
With those passengers to heaven  
By some chance  
I found a bottle in my fist  
And there I stood  
Nicely passing out the whiskey  
But the passengers were bound to resist  
  
And the people all said sit down  
Sit down you're rockin the boat  
The people all said sit down  
Sit down you're rockin the boat  
Cause the devil will drag you under  
By the sharp lapels of your checkered coat  
Sit down Sit down  
Sit down you're rockin the boat  
Oooh Oooh Oooh  
Oooh Oooh Oooh  
  
As we sail  
On that tiny boat to heaven  
Great big wave  
Came and washed me over board  
And as I sank  
Oh I hollered someone save me  
That's the moment I woke up  
Thank the lord  
  
And I said to myself sit down  
Sit down you're rockin the boat  
I said to myself sit down  
Sit down you're rockin the boat  
Cause the devil will drag you under  
By the sharp lapels of your checkered coat  
Sit down Sit down  
Sit down you're rockin the boat  
Sit down (Sit down) Sit down (Sit down)  
Sit down Sit down you're rockin the boat

Now, I don't want to lose you,  
but I don't want to use you just to have somebody by my side.  
And I don't want to hate you,  
I don't want to take you, but I don't want to be the one to cry.  
And I don't really matter to anyone anymore.  
But like a fool I keep losing my place and  
I keep seeing you walk through that door.  
  
But there's a danger in loving somebody to much,  
and it's sad when you know it's your heart you can't trust.  
There's a reason why people don't stay where they are.  
Baby, sometimes love just ain't enough.  
  
Now, I could never change you,  
I don't want to blame you.  
Baby, you don't have to take the fall.  
Yes, I may have hurt you, but I did not desert you.  
Maybe I just want to have it all.  
It makes a sound like thunder, it makes me feel like rain.  
And like a fool who will never see the truth,  
I keep thinking something's gonna change.  
  
But there's a danger in loving somebody to much,  
and it's bad when you know it's your heart they can't trust.  
There's a reason why people don't stay who they are.  
Baby, sometimes love just ain't enough.  
  
And there's no way home when it's late at night and you're all alone.  
Are there things that you wanted to say?  
And do you feel me beside you in your bed,  
there beside you where I used to be?  
  
But there's a danger in loving somebody to much,  
and it's bad when you know it's your heart you can't trust.  
There's a reason why people don't stay where they are.  
Baby, sometimes love just ain't enough.

Let's go down to the Sunset Grill  
We can watch the working girls go by  
Watch the "basket people" walk around and mumble  
And stare out at the auburn sky  
There's an old man there from the old world  
To him, it's all the same  
Calls all his customers by name  
  
[Chorus]  
Down at the Sunset Grill  
Down at the Sunset Grill  
Down at the Sunset Grill  
Down at the Sunset Grill  
  
You see a lot more meanness in the city  
It's the kind that eats you up inside  
Hard to come away with anything that feels like dignity  
Hard to get home with any pride  
These days a man makes you somethin'  
And you never see his face  
But there is no hiding place  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Respectable little murders pay  
They get more respectable every day  
Don't worry girl, I'm gonna stick by you  
And someday soon we're gonna get in that  
Car and get outta here  
  
Let's go down to the Sunset Grill  
Watch the working girls go by  
Watch the "basket people" walk around and mumble  
Gaze out at the auburn sky  
Maybe we'll leave come springtime  
Meanwhile, have another beer  
What would we do without all these jerks anyway?  
And besides, all our friends are here  
  
[Chorus]

Nobody on the road,  
Nobody on the beach.  
I feel it in the air,  
The summer's out of reach.  
Empty lake, empty streets,  
The sun goes down alone.  
I'm driving by your house  
Don't know you're not home.  
  
But I can see you,  
Your brown skin shining in the sun.  
You got your hair combed back  
And your sunglasses on, baby.  
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong  
After the boys of summer have gone.  
  
I never will forget those nights.  
I wonder if it was a dream.  
Remember how you made me crazy,  
Remember how I made you scream.  
I don't understand what happened to our love.  
But, baby, I'm gonna get you back,  
I'm gonna show you what I'm made of.  
  
I can see you,  
Your brown skin shining in the sun.  
I see you walking real slow  
And you're smiling at everyone.  
And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong  
After the boys of summer have gone.  
  
Out on the road today I saw a Deadhead sticker on a Cadillac.  
A little voice inside my head said:  
"Don't look back, you can never look back."  
I thought I knew what love was.  
What did I know?  
Those days are gone forever.  
I should just let 'em go, but  
  
I can see you,  
Your brown skin shining in the sun.  
You got that top pulled down,  
And that radio on, baby.  
And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong,  
After the boys of summer have gone.  
  
I can see you,  
Your brown skin shining in the sun.  
You got that hair slicked back,  
And those Wayfarers on, baby.  
And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong,  
After the boys of summer have gone.

Remember when the days were long  
And rolled beneath a deep blue sky  
Didn't have a care in the world  
With mommy and daddy standing by  
  
When "happily ever after" fails  
And we've been poisoned by these fairy tales  
The lawyers dwell on small details  
Since daddy had to fly  
  
But I know a place where we can go  
That's still untouched by man  
We'll sit and watch the clouds roll by  
And the tall grass wave in the wind  
  
You can lay your head back on the ground  
And let your hair fall all around me  
Offer up your best defense  
But this is the end  
  
This is the end of the innocence  
O' beautiful, for spacious skies  
But now those skies are threatening  
They're beating plowshares into swords  
  
For this tired old man that we elected king  
Armchair warriors often fail  
And we've been poisoned by these fairy tales  
The lawyers clean up all details  
  
Since daddy had to lie  
But I know a place where we can go  
And wash away this sin  
We'll sit and watch the clouds roll by  
  
And the tall grass wave in the wind  
Just lay your head back on the ground  
And let your hair spill all around me  
Offer up your best defense  
  
But this is the end  
This is the end of the innocence  
Who knows how long this will last  
Now we've come so far, so fast  
  
But, somewhere back there in the dust  
That same small town in each of us  
I need to remember this  
So baby give me just one kiss  
  
And let me take a long last look  
Before we say good bye  
Just lay your head back on the ground  
And let your hair fall all around me  
  
Offer up your best defense  
But this is the end  
This is the end of the innocence

I know you broke up with him  
And your heart's still on the shelf  
It's been over two years for me  
And I'm still not quite myself  
  
You can't be with someone new  
And you can't go back to him  
You're beginning to realize  
That it's sink or swim  
  
I see you around sometimes  
And my heart just melts  
You're lookin' like if you had your wish  
You'd be somewhere else  
  
And it just breaks my heart  
To see you here this way  
Someday I'll get the nerve  
To walk up to you and say  
  
This is the last worthless evening  
That you'll have to spend  
Just gimme a chance  
To show you how to love again  
  
This is the last worthless evening  
That you'll have to spend  
'Cause I'll be there  
When your broken heart is on the mend  
  
Every night it's the same old crowd  
In smoky rooms  
You catch a faint glimpse of love sometimes  
But it never blooms  
  
I've been around this block a time or two  
And I've made some big mistakes  
But girl I promise you, I promise you  
That this is the worthless evening  
  
That you'll have to spend  
Just gimme a chance  
To show you how to love again  
This is the last worthless evening  
  
That you'll have to spend  
'Cause it won't be long  
'Til your little heart is on the mend  
People inside their houses  
  
With the shades pulled down  
God knows, we could use some romance  
In this sleepy bedroom town  
I know you're still afraid to rush into anything  
  
But there're just so many summers  
And just so many springs  
And this is the last worthless evening  
That you'll have to spend  
  
Just gimme a chance to show you how  
To love again  
This is the last worthless evening  
That you'll have to spend, baby  
  
'Cause I'll be there when your broken heart  
Is on the mend  
This is the last worthless evening  
That you'll have to spend  
  
Just gimme a chance, gimme a chance  
To show you how to love again  
This is the last worthless evening  
That you'll have to spend 'cause it won't be long  
  
'Til your little heart is on the mend

O they tell me of a home far beyond the skies  
O they tell me of a home far away  
O they tell me of a place where no storm clouds rise  
O they tell me of an uncloudy day  
O they tell me of a place where my friends  
Have gone  
O they tell me of that land far away  
Where the tree of life in eternal bloom  
Sheds its fragrance on an uncloudy day  
  
O the land of cloudless day  
O the land of an uncloudy sky  
O they tell me of a place where no storm clouds rise  
O they tell me of uncloudy day  
  
O they tell me that he smiles on his children there  
And his smile drives their sorrows away  
And they tell me that no tears ever come again  
In that lovely land of uncloudy day  
  
O the land of cloudless day  
O the land of an uncloudy day  
O they tell me of a place where no storm clouds rise  
O they tell me of an uncloudy day  
O they tell me of an uncloudy day  
O they tell me of an uncloudy day  
O they tell me of an uncloudy day

One finger on the button  
one finger up his nose  
Johnny's in some cornfield  
The Early Warning Blows  
Bigger is better  
More is more  
Look up, America!  
Gonna even up the score  
Get ready boys  
Third times a charm  
Don't need no sweater  
It's gonna keep you warm  
If we can't have the ball, there won't be any winner  
this time  
Them and us  
Them and us  
Ashes to ashes  
Dust to dust  
If forty-five minutes  
It'll all be done  
We'll all be good and crispy  
But we'll still be number one  
And if things go from bad to worse  
We can still kill them if they kill us first  
If we can't have the ball, there won't be any winner  
this time  
Hell-bent  
Heaven sent  
It all got started by an accident  
If we can't have the ball, there won't be any winner  
this time  
Them and us  
Them and us  
Ashes to ashes  
Dust to dust  
Them and us  
Them and us  
Ashes to ashes  
Dust to dust

What kind of love have you got?  
You should be home, but you're not  
A room full of noise and dangerous boys  
Still makes you thirsty and hot  
I heard about you and that man  
There's just one thing I don't understand  
You say he's a liar and he put out  
Your fire  
How come you still got his gun in your hand?  
Victim of love, I see a broken heart  
You got your stories to tell  
Victim of love, it's such an easy part  
And you know how to play it so well  
  
Some people never come clean  
I think you know what I mean  
You're walkin' the wire, pain and desire  
Looking for love in between  
  
Tell me your secrets, I'll tell you mine  
This ain't no time to be cool  
And tell all your girlfriends,  
You "been around the world" friends  
That talk is for losers and fools  
  
Victim of love, I see a broken heart  
I could be wrong, but I'm not  
Victim of love, we're not so far apart  
Show me, what kind of love have you got?  
  
Victim of love, you're just a victim of love  
I could be wrong, but I'm not  
Victim of love, now you're a victim of love  
What kind of love have you got?  
What kind of love have you got?  
What kind of love have you got?

Mama told her baby,  
"girl, take it real slow."  
Girl told her mama,  
"hey, I really gotta go.  
"he's waitin' in the car."  
Mama said,  
"girl, you won't get far."  
  
This is the story of an average jane,  
Ninety miles an hour down a lover's lane  
On a tank of dreams.  
Oh, if she could have only seen.  
But fates got plans that it don't wanna show 'cause. ..  
  
That boy's just a walkaway joe,  
Born to be a leaver.  
Tell you from the word "go,"  
Destined to deceive her.  
He's the wrong kind of paradise.  
She's gonna know it in a matter of time.  
That boy's just a walkaway joe.  
  
Just a little while into abilene,  
He pulls into a station and he robs it clean.  
She's waitin' in the car  
Underneath the texaco star.  
  
She only wanted love,  
Never bargained for this.  
She can't help but love him for the way he is.  
She's only seventeen,  
And there ain't no reasoning.  
So she'll ride this ride  
As far as it will go, but. ..  
  
That boy's just a walkaway joe,  
Born to be a leaver.  
Tell you from the word "go,"  
Destined to deceive her.  
He's the wrong kind of paradise.  
She's gonna know it in a matter of time.  
That boy's just a walkaway joe.  
  
Somewhere in a roadside motel room,  
Alone in the silence she wakes up too soon  
And reaches for his arms.  
But she'll just keep reachin' on.  
'cause the cold hard truth revealed  
What it had known. ..  
  
That boy's just a walkaway joe,  
Born to be a leaver.  
Tell you from the word "go,"  
Destined to deceive her.  
He's the wrong kind of paradise.  
But it was just another lesson in life.  
That boy's just a walkaway joe.  
  
All he was was a walkaway joe.  
Ooh, walkaway joe. ..  
Ooh, he was a walkaway joe.  
Ooh, walkaway joe. ..  
Yes, he was a walkaway joe. ..

We were watchin' tv...watchin'tv  
We were watchin' tv...watchin'tv  
In tiananmen square  
Lost my baby there  
My yellow rose  
And her bloodstained clothes  
She was a short order pastry chef  
In a dim sum dive on the yangtze tideway  
She had shiny hair  
She was the daughter of an engineer  
Won't you she'd a tear  
For my yellow rose  
My yellow rose  
And her bloodstained clothes  
She had perfect breasts  
She had high hopes  
She had almond eyes  
She had yellow thighs  
She was a student of philosophy  
Won't you grieve with me  
For my yellow rose  
Shed a tear  
For her bloodstained clothes  
She had shiny hair  
She had perfect breasts  
She had high hopes  
She had almond eyes  
She had yellow thighs  
She was the daughter of an engineer  
So get out your pistols  
Get out your stones  
Get out your knives  
Cut them to the bone  
They are the lackeys of the grocer's machine  
They built the dark satanic mills  
That manufacture hell on earth  
They bought the front row seats on calvary  
They are irrelevant to me  
And I grieve for my sister  
People of china  
Do not forget do not forget  
The children who died for you  
Long live the republic  
Did we do anything after this  
I've a feeling we did  
We were watchin' tv...watchin' tv  
We were watchin' tv...watchin' tv  
She wore a white bandanna that said  
Freedom now  
She thought the great wall of china  
Would come tumbling down  
She was a student  
Her father was an engineer  
Won't you she'd a tear  
For my yellow rose  
My yellow rose  
And her bloodstained clothes  
Her grandpa fought old chiang kai-shek  
That no-good low-down dirty rat  
Who used to order his troops  
To fire on the women and children  
Imagine that imagine that  
And in the spring of '48  
Mao tse-tung got quite irate  
And he kicked that old dictator chiang  
Out of the state of china  
Chiang kai-shek came down in formosa  
And they armed the island of quemoy  
And the shells were flying across the china sea  
And they turned formosa into a shoe factory  
Called taiwan  
And she is different from cro-magnon man  
She's different from anne boleyn  
She is different from the rosenbergs  
And from the unknown jew  
She is different from the unknown nicaraguan  
Half superstar half victim  
She's a victor star conceptually new  
And she is different from the dodo  
And from the kankanbono  
She is different from the aztec  
And from the cherokee  
She's everybody's sister  
She's symbolic of our failure  
She's the one in fifty million  
Who can help us to be free  
Because she died on tv

You can make money, you can make good  
Friends  
You can make mistakes and you can make  
Amends  
You can make it easy when push comes to  
Shove, but  
You can't make love  
You can make advances, you can make  
Big plans  
Plant sloppy kisses all over her hands  
You can tell her everything you're dreamin'  
Of, but  
You can't make love  
Love's a little word that been kicked around  
Used too much, beaten down  
What in the world are you thinkin' of?  
You can't make love  
You can go through the motions with your  
Magic spells  
Buy all the potions that fifth avenue sells  
You can try to call down all the stars above,  
But  
You can't make love  
You can buy her diamonds, you can go out in style  
You can make a promise, you can walk  
Down the aisle  
You can make a life for her that fits like  
A glove, but  
You can' t make love  
Oh, it takes so long  
You gotta be strong  
Before it's gone  
What in the world where you thinkin' of,  
Boy  
You can't make love
