Am I dreaming  
People are passing the loneliness  
Am I different  
Who's to blame for all of this  
Do you think I don't exist  
Cause there comes the pain  
I'm better off without you  
Yes, I'm better off alone  
I'm better off without you  
And I'm better off when I'm on my own  
It seems to me that I have been  
A fool for all I said to you (2x)  
Am I dreaming  
Where it's freedom for all of us, oh yeah  
How love kills the pain  
I'm better off without you  
Yes, I'm better off alone  
I'm better off without you  
Yes, I'm better off alone  
I'm better off without you  
And I'm better off when I'm on my own  
It seems to me that I have been  
A fool for all I said to you (4x)

Get get get get your widowmaker  
And put your children back inside.  
Yet yet yet yet another failure  
In this life of the free.  
Black hope shot down  
There's a gun in his hand  
That souls divine  
There's a hole in his head.  
Back back back back off for I break you  
And that's how everything goes down.  
Run run run run away don't stay here  
Or they'll say it's your time.  
Black hope shot down  
There's a gun in his hand  
That souls divine  
There's a hole in his head.  
Black hope shot down  
There's a gun in his hand.  
Shot down  
  
Black hope shot down  
There's a gun in his hand  
That souls divine  
There's a hole in his head.  

And after many hours,  
We don't know where we're going,  
I fear it's destination zero  
And it's so hard to please you,  
To say the words that ease you.  
But I will always go my own way  
This was already known  
But never really shown  
I know it''s destination zero  
But have you really tried,  
I know that I was I  
But now I'm falling even harder  
And you fall and you cry and you want me to die  
Everything comes down on me  
Despite of this you look so good to me  
And you fall and you cry and you want me to die  
Everything comes down on me  
Despite of this you look so good to me  
Wave me goodbye  
Save me tonight  
Take me away  
Just turn it around  
And you fall and you cry and you want me to die  
Everything comes down on me  
Despite of this you look so good to me  
And you fall and you cry and you want me to die  
Everything comes down on me  
Despite of this you look so good to me  
Good to me  
Good to me

Here by I return your love  
I just want to give it back  
I am fading  
The silence can be beautiful but also very cold  
But somewhere out there there's a place where I belong  
Cause one thing I know  
Somewhere out there there's a place where I belong  
Goodbye  
But somewhere out there there's a place where I belong  
Goodbye  
But somewhere out there there's a place where I belong  
The choices can be hard to make  
Is it luck or is it love  
I am waiting  
I'm waiting for the voice inside me to tell me what I'm not  
But somewhere out there there's a place where I belong  
Cause one thing I know  
Somewhere out there there's a place where I belong  
Goodbye  
But somewhere out there there's a place where I belong  
Goodbye  
But somewhere out there there's a place where I belong  
Cause one thing I know  
Somewhere out there there's a place where I belong  
Goodbye  
But somewhere out there there's a place where I belong  
Goodbye  
But somewhere outhere there's a place where I belong  
Somewhere outhere(8x)

Save me, come on girl and find me  
I'll just sit and wait here  
I'm waiting for the moment that somebody opens my luck  
My luck is slowly fading I'm loosing it unless...  
This is nothing but a dream I can't remember it was...  
Hey girl you didn't say your name now  
Tomorrow I' ll remember, remember that you're so....  
Hey girl you didn't say your name now  
Tomorrow I' ll remember, remember that you're so....  
Hey girl you didn't say your name girl  
Tomorrow I'll remember,  
Remember that your name was starting with an "s" and ending,  
Endings are scary the story of my life is  
I'm allways very close but then it slips away  
Hey girl you didn't say your name now  
Tomorrow I' ll remember, remember that you're so....  
Hey girl you didn't say your name now  
Tomorrow I' ll remember, remember that you're so....  
  

I open the door see a baby  
Blue eyes, filled with a spark  
She's wearing her dress and  
All I can see is gold  
And I see her, I call her, she hears me  
And all there is to know  
Is hidden from everybody  
Except the both of us  
It was a good life  
You were the king of your mind  
Oh so excited  
To be a little child again  
I feel alright  
Tadadadadamdadadam  
I feel alright  
Tadadadadamdadadam  
And there she is playing  
And laughing and singing out loud  
And as I will gather  
I think I might getting older  
It was a good life  
You were the king of your mind  
Oh so excited  
To be a little child again  
I feel alright  
Tadadadadamdadadam  
I feel alright  
Tadadadadamdadadam  
  

It's not hard to know when your body is aching  
I'm alone at night and I don't seem to be patient now  
And I don't know the rules to win  
Believe in my dreams (that) I'm gonna have  
But before I even met the other ones that long obsessed  
Have you been lost I'm looking for  
The songs I need before I go  
My house my town 'cause I said so  
And I will go  
It's so unreal and I will love  
The things I feel are not a joke  
It's so unreal and I will love  
The things I feel  
It's not hard to know when your body is aching  
I'm alone at night and I don't seem to be patient now  
And I don't know the rules to win  
Believe in my dreams (that) I'm gonna have  
But before I even met the other ones that long obsessed  
Have you been lost I'm looking for  
The songs I need before I go  
My house my town 'cause I said so  
And I will go  
It's so unreal and I will love  
The things I feel are not a joke  
It's so unreal and I will love  
The things I feel  
  

I haven't seen the things you've seen,  
I'm rushing to an empty goal,  
I lost control  
Every minute I remind myself,  
There's no way back unless I fall,  
I'm fighting my war  
Keep me down  
Keep me down,  
No  
What's not I can not help tumble down  
But it's too late too soon or now  
I lost control  
And you push me back up  
And I wanna get down  
And you push me back up  
And I wanna get down on the ground  
I wanna get out  
Keep me down  
Keep me down,  
No  
And you push me up more and I wanna get down  
And you push me up more and I wanna resist  
And I push you on the floor but I don't wanna fight  
Can we please now stop  
Keep me down  
Keep me down,  
No [2x]  
  

You reach for pain  
You reach for fear  
You reach for everything  
But nothing ever comes your way  
  
And I'm not lying  
You always complain about the way I behave without you  
  
And last night I had a dream  
About it  
And it's very hard to stay faithful  
To a dream of you  
  
CHORUS:  
Think about the lies  
That we told to each other  
We never bothered  
What a big surprise  
That your scared of yourself  
And alone all again  
  
You reach for me  
You reach for us  
You reach for everything  
But nothing ever comes my way  
  
But you  
You are nothing but a state of mind  
From the start until the end  
  
CHORUS x 2

I want to climb up in the sky with you  
To seize the stars and put them on your head  
I want to take you down  
Where the sun begins  
A journey on the clouds once again  
I wonder if I will ever see your face again  
And the rest of my opinion is of no importance  
Guess I have made a choice  
For us  
We are lost  
In this world  
We are lost  
In this time  
We are lost  
We decide  
We are lost  
We are lost, lost in our own world  
It doesn't even matter if you like it or not  
We are lost, lost in our own world  
It doesn't even matter if you're happy or not  
We are lost, lost in are own world  
It doesn't even matter if you like it or not  
We are lost, lost in our own world  
It doesn't even matter if you're happy or not

Everytime you move  
There's a spark that seems to find its' way  
To everything I own  
I am losing in your favorite way  
'cause you move me, yeah you move me  
And you move me  
And you move, you move, you move, you move  
You are everything I have  
Yeah you are everything I have  
The secrets that we share  
Aren't always so important that we  
Have to disagree  
About lots of things we used to do  
'cause you move me, yeah you move me  
And you move me  
And you move, you move, you move, you move  
You are everything I have  
Yeah you are everything I have  
Hey there switch your mind of  
And untie me  
You move me 'round the day  
For a while  
I'm not lost, I am saved now  
You untied me  
You move me 'round the day  
Everytime I come  
There's a spark that seems to find its' way  
To everything I own  
I am loosing in a favorite way  
'cause you move me, yeah you move me  
And you move me  
And you move, you move, you move, you move  
You are everything I have  
Yeah you are everything I have  
Yeah you are everything I have  
You are everything I have  
Hey there switch your mind of  
And untie me  
You move me 'round the day  
For a while  
I'm not lost, I am saved now  
You untied me  
You move me 'round the day  
For a while I thought you liked me....
