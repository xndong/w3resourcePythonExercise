Well it's raining, it's pouring  
You didn't bring a sweater  
Nebraska'll never let you come back home  
  
Now on Hollywood and Vine  
By the Thrifty Mart sign  
Any night I'll be willin' to bet  
  
There's a young girl  
With sweet little dreams and pretty blue wishes  
Standin' there just gettin' all wet  
  
Now there's a place off the drag  
Called the Gilbert Hotel  
And there's a couple letters  
Burned out in the sign  
  
And it's better than a bus stop  
They do good business every time it rains  
For little girls with nothing in their jeans  
But pretty blue wishes and sweet little jeans  
  
And it's raining it's pouring  
The old man is snoring  
Now I lay me down to sleep  
I hear the sirens in the street  
All my dreams are made of chrome  
I have no way to get back home  
I'd rather die before I wake  
Like Marilyn Monroe  
And you could throw my dreams out in the street  
And let the rain make 'em grow  
  
Now the night clerk he got a club foot  
He's heard every hard luck story  
At least a hundred times or more  
  
He says: check out time is 10 am  
And that's just what it means  
Go on up the stairs  
With sweet little wishes and pretty blue dreams  
  
And it's raining it's pouring  
And Hollywood's just fine  
Swindle a little girl out of her dreams  
Another letter in the sign  
  
Now never trust a scarecrow wearin' shades after dark  
Be careful of that old bow tie he wears  
It takes a sweet little bullet from a pretty blue gun  
To put those scarlet ribbons in your hair  
  
No that ain't no cherry bomb  
Fourth of July's all done  
Just some fool playin' that second line  
From the barrel of a pretty blue gun  
  
No that ain't no cherry bomb  
Fourth of July's all done  
Just some fool playin' that second line  
From the barrel of a pretty blue gun

You're the head on the spear  
You're the nail on the cross  
You're the fly in my beer  
You're the key that got lost  
You're the letter from Jesus on the bathroom wall  
You're Mother Superior with only a bra  
You're the same kind of bad as me  
You're the same kind of bad as me  
  
I'm the hat on the bed  
I'm the coffee instead  
The fish or cut bait  
I'm the detective up late  
I'm the blood on the floor  
The thunder and the roar  
I'm the boat that won't sink  
I just won't sleep a wink  
You're the same kind of bad as me  
You're the same kind of bad as me  
You're the same kind of bad as me  
You're the same kind of bad as me  
  
No good you say  
Well that's good enough for me  
  
You're the wreath that caught fire  
You're the preach to the choir  
You bite down on the sheet  
But your teeth have been wired  
You skid in the rain  
You're trying to shift  
You're grinding the gears  
You're trying to shift  
And you're the same kind of bad as me  
You're the same kind of bad as me  
She's the same kind of bad as me  
You're the same kind of bad as me  
  
They told me you were no good  
I know you'll take care of all my needs  
You're the same kind of bad as me  
  
I'm the mattress in the back  
I'm the old gunnysack  
I'm the one with the gun  
Most likely to run  
I'm the car in the weeds  
If you cut me I'll bleed  
You're the same kind of bad as me  
You're the same kind of bad as me  
Same kind of bad as me  
You're the same kind of bad as me  
You're the same kind of bad as me  
  
Uno, dos, tres, quatro  
Same kind of bad as me

I got the style but not the grace  
I got the clothes but not the face  
I got the bread but not the butter  
I got the window but not the shutter  
  
But I'm big In Japan  
I'm big in Japan  
Hey, but I'm big in Japan  
I'm big in Japan  
  
I got the house but not the deed  
I got the horn but not the reed  
I got the cards but not the luck  
I got the wheel but not the truck  
  
But hey, I'm big in Japan  
I'm big in Japan  
But hey, I'm big in Japan  
I'm big in Japan  
  
I got the moon, I got the cheese  
I got the whole damn nation on their knees  
I got the rooster, I got the crow  
I got the ebb, I got the flow  
  
I got the powder but not the gun  
I got the dog but not the bun  
I got the clouds but not the sky  
I got the stripes but not the tie  
  
But hey, I'm big in Japan  
I'm big in Japan  
I'm big in Japan  
I'm big in Japan  
I'm big in Japan  
  
Hey-ho, they love the way I do it  
Hey-ho, there's really nothing to it  
  
I got the moon, I got the cheese  
I got the whole damn nation on their knees  
I got the rooster, I got the crow  
I got the ebb, I got the flow  
  
I got the sizzle but not the steak  
I got the boat but not the lake  
I got the sheets but not the bed  
I got the jam but not the bread  
  
But hey, I'm big in Japan  
I'm big in Japan  
I'm big in Japan  
Hey! I'm big in Japan  
I'm big in Japan  
I'm big in Japan

Blue skies over my head  
Give me another reason to get out of bed  
And blue skies shine on my face  
Give me another woman to take her place  
  
Ain't got no money, cupboards are bare  
No cigarettes and the kids got nothing to wear  
She walked out without a word  
Now the only sound left is the morning bird  
singing ...  
  
Blue skies over my head  
Give me another reason to get out of bed  
And blue skies shine on my face  
Give me another woman to take her place  
  
Blue skies over my head  
Give me another reason to get out of bed  
And blue skies shine on my face  
Give me another woman to take her place  
Give me another woman to take her place

She sends me blue valentines  
All the way from philadelphia  
To mark the anniversary  
Of someone that I used to be  
And it feels like  
A warrant out for my arrest  
Baby you got me checkin in my rearview mirror  
And Im always on the run  
That's why I changed my name  
And I didn't think you'd ever find me here  
  
To send me blue valentines  
Like half forgotten dreams  
Like a pebble in my shoe  
As I walk these streets  
And the ghost of your memory  
Baby Its the thistle in the kiss  
Its the burgler that can break a roses neck  
Its the tatooed broken promise  
I gotta hide beneath my sleeve  
And I see you every time I turn my back  
  
She sends me blue valentines  
While tring to remain at large  
They're insisting that our love  
Must have a eulogy  
Why do I save all of this madness  
Here in the nightstand drawer  
There to haunt upon my shoulders  
Baby I know  
Id be luckier to walk around everywhere I go  
With this blind and broken heart  
That sleeps beneath my lapel  
  
She sends me my blue valentines  
To remind me of my cardinal sin  
I can never wash the guilt  
Or get these bloodstains off my handa  
And it takes a whole lot of whiskey  
To take this nightmares go away  
And I cut my bleedin heart out every nite  
And I die just little more each st. valentines day  
Remember that I promised I would  
Write you...  
These blue valentines  
Blue valentines  
Blue valentines

Books of Moses, bringing stone news  
Wet in the water, weeping in the sun  
Books of Moses, got some splinters didn't you  
Books of Moses, brought me right here back to you  
  
Flaming heart, ain't it sweet  
Lighting the world at your feet  
Books of Moses, myth and truth  
Books of Moses, bring me back to you  
  
Hero's welcome, there stands your king  
Where the serpent shudders and the angels sing  
Books of Moses, happening again  
Yes he knows us  
Well welcome him, your friend  
  
Books of Moses, bringing stone news  
Wet is the water, blood covering the sun  
Books of Moses, myth and truth  
Books of Moses, bring me back to you

My Daddy told me, lookin back  
The best friend you'll have is a railroad track  
So when I was 13 I said, I'm rollin' my own,  
And I'm leaving Missouri and I'm never coming home  
  
And I'm lost  
And I'm lost  
I'm lost at the bottom of the world  
I'm handcuffed to the Bishop and the barbershop liar  
I'm lost at the bottom of the world  
  
Satchel puddin' and Lord God Mose  
Sittin' by the fire with a busted nose  
That fresh egg yeller is too damn rare  
But the white part is perfect for slickin' down your hair  
  
And I'm lost  
And I'm lost  
I'm lost at the bottom of the world  
I'm handcuffed to the Bishop and the barbershop liar  
I'm lost at the bottom of the world  
  
Blackjack Ruby and Nimrod Cain  
The moon's the color of a coffee stain  
Jesse Franks and Birdy Joe Hoax  
But who is the king of all of these folks?  
  
And I'm lost  
And I'm lost  
I'm lost at the bottom of the world  
I'm handcuffed to the Bishop and the barbershop liar  
I'm lost at the bottom of the world  
  
Well I dined last night with Scarface Ron  
On Telapia fish cakes and fried black swan  
Razorweed onion and peacock squirrel  
And I dreamed all night about a beautiful girl  
  
And I'm lost  
And I'm lost  
I'm lost at the bottom of the world  
I'm handcuffed to the Bishop and the barbershop liar  
I'm lost at the bottom of the world  
  
Well God's green hair is where I slept last  
He balanced a diamond on a blade of grass  
Now I woke me up with a cardinal bird  
And when I wanna talk he  
Hangs on every word  
  
And I'm lost  
And I'm lost  
I'm lost at the bottom of the world  
I'm handcuffed to the Bishop and the barbershop liar  
I'm lost at the bottom of the world

Broken bicycles, old busted chains  
With busted handle bars out in the rain.  
Somebody must have an orphanage for  
All these things that nobody wants any more  
September's reminding July  
It's time to be saying good-bye  
Summer is gone, Our love will remain  
Like old broken bicycles out in the rain  
  
Broken bicycles, don't tell my folks  
There's all those playing cards pinned to the spokes  
Laid down like skeletons out on the lawn  
The wheels won't turn when the other has gone  
The seasons can turn on a dime  
Somehow I forget every time  
For all the things that you've given me  
Will always stay, there broken but I'll never throw them away

Danny says we gotta go  
Gotta go to Idaho  
But we can't go surfin'  
Cause it's twenty below  
  
Sound check's at 5:02  
Record stores and interviews  
Oh, but I can't wait  
To be with you tomorrow  
  
Baby  
  
Oho-ho-ho, we got nowhere to go  
And it may sound funny, but it's true  
Hangin' out in 100 B  
Watching 'Get Smart' on TV  
Thinkin' about  
You and me and you and me  
  
Hangin' out in L.A.  
And there's nowhere to go  
It ain't Christmas if there ain't no snow  
Listening to Sheena on the radio  
Oh-ho oh-ho

I got your letter today  
And I miss you all so much here  
I can't wait to see you all  
And I'm counting the days here  
  
I still believe that there's gold  
At the end of the world  
And I'll come home to Illinois  
On the day after tomorrow  
  
It is so hard and it's cold here  
And I'm tired of taking orders  
And I miss old Rockford town  
Up by the Wisconsin border  
  
What I miss, you won't believe  
Shovelling snow and raking leaves  
And my plane will touch down  
On the day after tomorrow  
  
I close my eyes every night  
And I dream that I can hold you  
  
They fill us full of lies, everyone buys  
'Bout what it means to be a soldier  
I still don't know how I'm supposed to feel  
'Bout all the blood that's been spilled  
Will god on this throne  
Get me back home  
On the day after tomorrow  
  
You can't deny, the other side  
Don't want to die anymore then we do  
What I'm trying to say is don't they pray  
To the same god that we do?  
  
And tell me how does god choose  
Whose prayers does he refuse?  
Who turns the wheel  
Who throws the dice  
On the day after tomorrow  
  
I'm not fighting, for justice  
I am not fighting, for freedom  
I am fighting, for my life  
And another day in the world here  
  
I just do what I've been told  
We're just the gravel on the road  
And only the lucky ones come home  
On the day after tomorrow  
  
And the summer, it too will fade  
And with it brings the winter's frost dear  
And I know we too are made  
Of all the things that we have lost here  
  
I'll be 21 today  
I been saving all my pay  
And my plane will touch down  
On the day after tomorrow  
And my plane it will touch down  
On the day after tomorrow

Red pants and the sugarman in, the temple street gloom, drinkin' chivas  
Regal in a four dollar room, just another dead soldier in a powder blue night,  
Sugarman says baby everything's alright, goin' downtown down downtown.  
  
Montclaire de havelin doin' the st. vitus dance, lookin' for someone to chop  
The lumber in his pants, how am I gonna unload all of this ice and all this  
Mink, all the traffic in the street but it's so hard to think, goin' downtown  
Down downtown.  
  
Frankie's wearin' lipstick pierre cardin, I swear to god I seen him holdin'  
Hands with jimmy bond, sally's high on crank and hungry for some sweets, she's  
Fem in the sheets but she's butch in the streets, goin' downtown down  
Downtown.  
  
It's the cool of the evening the sun's goin' down, I want to hold you in my  
Arms I want to push you around, I want to break your bottle and spill out all  
Your charms, come on baby we'll set off all the burglar alarms, goin' downtown  
Down downtown.  
  
Red pants and the sugarman in the temple, drinkin' Chivas Regal in a four  
Dollar room, just another dead soldier in a powder blue night, red pants turns  
To sugarman and says everything's alright, goin' downtown down downtown.

Tight-slacked clad girls on the graveyard shift  
Neath the cement stroll  
Catch the midnight drift  
Cigar chewing Charlie  
In the newspaperness  
Grifting hot-horse tips  
On who's running the best  
  
[Chorus]  
And I'm blinded by the neon  
Don't try and change my tune  
Cause I thought I heard a saxophone  
I'm drunk on the moon  
  
And the moon's a silver slipper  
It's pouring champagne stars  
Broadway's like a serpent  
Pulling shiny top-down cars  
Laramer is teeming  
With that undulating beat  
And some Bonneville is screaming  
It's way wilder down the street  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hearts flutter and race  
The moon's on the wane  
Tarts mutter their dream hopes  
The night will ordain  
Come schemers and dancers  
Cherry delight  
As a Cleveland-bound Greyhound  
And it cuts through the night  
  
And I've hawked all my yesterdays  
Don't try and change my tune  
'Cause I thought I heard a saxophone  
I'm drunk on the moon

I'm going away  
I'm going away  
I'm going away  
I'm going away  
  
The cradle wants a baby  
Kitchen wants a pan  
The heart wants a certain kind of lover if it can  
  
The ocean wants a sailor  
The gun wants a hand  
Money wants a spender  
And the road wants a man  
  
I'll turn my face to the highway  
I'll turn my face to the highway  
I'll turn my face to the highway  
And I'll turn my back on you  
  
Devil wants a sinner  
The sky wants a bird  
The table wants the dinner  
Lips want a word  
  
Glass wants the wine  
Fist wants to hurt  
Clock wants the time  
And the shovel wants to work  
  
I'll turn my face to the highway  
I'll turn my face to the highway  
I'll turn my face to the highway  
And I'll turn my back on you  
  
I'm going away  
I'm going away  
I'm going away  
I'm going away  
I'm going away  
Going away  
Going away  
  
Coal wants a miner  
Soldier takes a stand  
The walls of the prison  
Want a solitary man  
The window wants a curtain  
The plow wants the land  
Diamond ring wants to  
Fit upon the finger of her hand  
  
I'll turn my face to the highway  
I'll turn my face to the highway  
I'll turn my face to the highway  
And I'll turn my back on you  
  
Going away  
Going away  
I'm going away  
I'm going away  
I'm going away  
I'm going away  
I'm going away  
I'm going away  
I'm going away  
I'm going away  
I'm going away  
I'm going away  
I'm going away  
I'm going away  
I'm going away

There's a crooked street in Houston town  
It's a well born path I've traveled down  
Now there's ruin in my name, I wish I never got off the train  
I wished I'd listened to the words you said  
  
Don't go down to Fannin Street  
Don't go down to Fannin Street  
Don't go down to Fannin Street  
You'll be lost and never found  
You can never turn around  
Don't go down to Fannin Street  
  
Once I held you in my arms, I was sure  
But I took that silent stare through the guilded door  
The desire to have much more, all the glitter and the roar  
I know this is where the sidewalk ends  
  
Don't go down to Fannin Street  
Don't go down to Fannin Street  
Don't go down to Fannin Street  
You'll be lost and never found  
You can never turn around  
Don't go down to Fannin Street  
  
When I was young I thought only of getting out  
I said goodbye to my street, goodbye to my house  
Give a man gin, give a man cards, give an inch he takes a yard  
And I rue the day that I stepped off this train  
  
Don't go down to Fannin Street  
Don't go down to Fannin Street  
Don't go down to Fannin Street  
You'll be lost and never found  
You can never turn around  
Don't go down to Fannin Street

I don't want to feel all cooped up  
I feel like I'm on a chain  
I got my ride all souped up  
We're never coming back again  
Time it don't mean nothing  
Money means even less  
Don't bring nothin' baby  
You're better then all the rest  
I wanna go get lost  
I wanna go get lost  
I wanna go get, I wanna go get lost  
  
When you wear that real tight sweater  
You know I can't resist  
It's been that way forever baby  
Ever since we kissed  
Roll down all the windows  
Turn up Wolfman Jack  
Please, please love me tender  
Ain't nothin' wrong with that  
Let's go get lost yeah  
Let's go get lost yeah  
Let's go get lost  
I wanna go get lost yeah  
  
Whatever that they told you about me  
Well all of it's true  
You're never gonna be with out me baby  
I'm never gonna be without you  
Top it off, fill it with high test  
Think about it what cha gonna tell your boss?  
Think about it what cha gonna tell your boss?  
Think about it what cha gonna tell your boss?  
Think about it what cha gonna tell your boss?  
  
And get lost  
I just wanna get, I just wanna get lost  
I wanna get lost  
I just wanna get  
I just wanna get  
I just wanna get  
I want to get  
I just wanna get  
I just wanna get lost  
All night long  
All night long  
All night long  
All night long  
  
I wanna get lost  
Just wanna get lost  
I wanna get lost  
I wanna get lost

Well It's a quarter a two  
and looking at you  
and going down, going down slow  
Well It's a quarter a two  
and looking at you  
and going down, going down slow  
  
TV went off about one, we have only begun  
I know that the Wednesday may come  
but I have no intention of going home  
  
Well It's a quarter a three  
digging on me  
and going down, going down slow  
  
Could stay here all night,  
they claim your outta sight  
please get up and turn out the light  
There ain't nothing better than the middle of the night  
  
And It's a quarter a four  
begging for more  
and going down, going down slow  
going down, going down slow  
going down, going down slow  
going down, going down slow

Grapefruit moon, one star shining, shining down on me.  
Heard that tune, and now I'm pining, honey, can't you see?  
Cause every time I hear that melody, well, something breaks inside,  
And the grapefruit moon, one star shining, can't turn back the tide.  
  
Never had no destination, could not get across.  
You became my inspiration, oh but what a cost.  
Cause every time I hear that melody, well, something breaks inside,  
And the grapefruit moon, one star shining, is more than I can hide.  
  
Now I'm smoking cigarettes and I strive for purity,  
And I slip just like the stars into obscurity.  
Cause every time I hear that melody, well, puts me up a tree,  
And the grapefruit moon, one star shining, is all that I can see.

Liar liar with your pants on fire, white spades hangin' on the telephone  
Wire, gamblers reevaluate along the dotted line, you'll never recognize  
Yourself on heartattack and vine.  
  
Doctor lawyer beggar man thief, Philly Joe remarkable looks on in disbelief,  
If you want a taste of madness, you'll have to wait in line, you'll probably  
See someone you know on heartattack and vine.  
  
Boney's high on china white, shorty found a punk, don't you know there ain't  
No devil, there's just god when he's drunk, well this stuff will probably kill  
You, let's do another line, what you say you meet me down on heartattack and  
Vine.  
  
See that little jersey girl in the see-through top, with the peddle pushers  
Sucking on a soda pop, well I bet she's still a virgin but it's only twenty-  
Five 'til nine, you can see a million of 'em on heartattack and vine.  
  
Better off in iowa against your scrambled eggs, than crawling down cahuenga  
On a broken pair of legs, you'll find your ignorance is blissful every goddamn  
Time, your're waitin' for the RTD on heartattack and vine.

They hung a sign up in our town  
"If you live it up, you won't live it down"  
So she left Monte Rio, son  
Just like a bullet leaves a gun  
With her charcoal eyes and Monroe hips  
She went and took that California trip  
Oh, the moon was gold, her hair like wind  
Said, 'Don't look back, just come on, Jim'  
  
Oh, you got to hold on, hold on  
You gotta hold on  
Take my hand, I'm standing right here  
You gotta hold on  
  
Well, he gave her a dimestore watch  
And a ring made from a spoon  
Everyone's looking for someone to blame  
  
When you share my bed, you share my name  
Well, go ahead and call the cops  
You don't meet nice girls in coffee shops  
She said, 'Baby, I still love you'  
Sometimes there's nothin' left to do  
  
Oh, but you got to hold on, hold on  
Babe, you gotta hold on  
And take my hand, I'm standing right here  
You gotta hold on  
  
Well, God bless your crooked little heart  
St. Louis got the best of me  
I miss your broken China voice  
How I wish you were still here with me  
Oh, you build it up, you wreck it down  
Then you burn your mansion to the ground  
Oh, there's nothing left to keep you here  
But when you're falling behind in this big blue world  
  
Oh, you've got to hold on, hold on  
Babe, you gotta hold on  
Take my hand, I'm standing right here  
You gotta hold on  
  
Down by the Riverside motel  
It's 10 below and falling  
By a 99 cent store  
She closed her eyes and started swaying  
But it's so hard to dance that way  
When it's cold and there's no music  
Oh, your old hometown's so far away  
But inside your head there's a record that's playing  
  
A song called 'Hold On', hold on  
Babe, you gotta hold on  
Take my hand, I'm standing right there  
You gotta hold on  
  
You gotta hold on, hold on  
Babe, you gotta hold on  
Take my hand, I'm standing right there  
You gotta hold on  
  
You gotta hold on, hold on  
Babe, you gotta hold on  
And take my hand, I'm standing right here  
You gotta hold on  
  
You gotta hold on, hold on  
Babe, you gotta hold on  
And take my hand, I'm standing right here  
You gotta hold on  
  
You gotta hold on  
You gotta hold on  
You gotta hold on  
You gotta hold on  
You gotta hold on, baby  
You gotta hold on, girl  
You gotta hold on  
You gotta hold on

Well, I wish I was in New Orleans, I can see it in my dreams,  
Arm-in-arm down Burgundy, a bottle and my friends and me  
  
Hoist up a few tall cool ones, play some pool and listen  
To that tenor saxophone calling me home  
And I can hear the band begin When the Saints Go Marching In,  
And by the whiskers on my chin, New Orleans, I'll be there  
  
I'll drink you under the table, be red-nosed, go for walks,  
The old haunts what I wants is red beans and rice  
And wear the dress I like so well, and meet me at the old saloon,  
Make sure that there's a Dixie moon, New Orleans, I'll be there  
  
And deal the cards roll the dice, if it ain't that old Chuck E. Weiss,  
And Claiborne Avenue, me and you Sam Jones and all  
  
And I wish I was in New Orleans, 'cause I can see it in my dreams,  
Arm-in-arm down Burgundy, a bottle and my friends and me  
New Orleans, I'll be there

I'll be clickin' by your house about two forty-five  
Sidewalk sundae strawberry surprise,  
I got a cherry popsicle right on time  
A big stick, mamma, that'll blow your mind  
  
Cause I'm the ice cream man, I'm a one-man band (yeah)  
I'm the ice cream man, honey, I'll be good to you.  
  
Baby, missed me in the alley, baby, don't you fret  
Come back around and don't forget,  
When you're tired and you're hungry and you want something cool,  
Got something better than a swimming pool  
  
Cause I'm the ice cream man, I'm a one-man band  
I'm the ice cream man, honey, I'll be good to you.  
Cause I'm the ice cream man, I'm a one-man band  
I'm the ice cream man, honey, I'll be good to you.  
  
See me coming, you ain't got no change  
Don't worry baby, it can be arranged:  
Show me you can smile, baby just for me  
Fix you with a drumstick, I'll do it for free  
  
Cause I'm the ice cream man, I'm a one-man band  
I'm the ice cream man, honey, I'll be good to you.  
Be good to you, be good to you,  
Good to you yeah, good to you yeah, good to you yeah, good to you yeah,  
Good to you yeah, good to you, I'll be good to you, I'll be good to you

I can clearly see nothing as clear  
I keep falling apart every year  
Let's take a hammer to it  
There's no glamour in it  
Is there any way out of this dream  
I'm as blue as I can possibly be  
Is there someone else out there for me  
Summer is dragging its feet  
I feel so incomplete  
Is there any way out of this dream  
Summer is dragging its feet  
I feel so incomplete  
Is there any way out of this dream  

Got no time for the corner boys,  
Down in the street makin' all that noise,  
Don't want no whores on eighth avenue,  
Cause tonight I'm gonna be with you.  
  
'Cause tonight I'm gonna take that ride,  
Across the river to the jersey side,  
Take my baby to the carnival,  
And I'll take you on all the rides,  
Sing sha la la la la la sha la la la.  
  
Down the shore everything's alright,  
You're with your baby on a Saturday night,  
Don't you know that all my dreams come true,  
When I'm walkin' down the street with you,  
Sing sha la la la la la sha la la la.  
  
You know she thrills me with all her charms,  
When I'm wrapped up in my baby's arms,  
My little angel gives me everything,  
I know someday that she'll wear my ring.  
  
So don't bother me cause I got no time,  
I'm on my way to see that girl of mine,  
Nothin' else matters in this whole wide world,  
When you're in love with a jersey girl,  
Sing sha la la la la la la.  
  
And I call your name, I can't sleep at night,  
Sha la la la la la la.

Well, I'm a jitterbug boy, by the shoe-shine  
Resting on my laurels and my hardys too  
Life of Riley on a swing shift, gears follow my drift  
Once upon a time I was in show-biz too  
I seen the Brooklyn Dodgers playing at Ebbets Field  
Seen the Kentucky Derby too  
It's fast women, slow horses, unreliable sources,  
And I'm holding up the lamp-post if you want to know  
I've seen the Wabash Cannonball, buddy, I've done it all  
Cause I slept with the lions and Marilyn Monroe,  
Had breakfast in the eye of a hurricane  
Fought Rocky Marciano, played Minnesota Fats,  
Burned hundred-dollar bills, I've eaten Mulligan stew  
Got drunk with Louis Armstrong, what's that old song?  
I taught Mickey Mantle everything that he knows  
So you ask me what I'm doing here holding up the lamp-post,  
Flipping this quarter, trying to make up my mind  
And if it's heads I go to Tennessee, and tails I buy a drink,  
If it lands on the edge I keep talking to you  
(scat)

The fire's dying out  
All the embers have been spent  
Outside on the street  
Lovers hide in the shadows  
You look at me  
I look at you  
There's only one thing  
I want you to do  
  
Kiss me  
I want you to kiss me  
Like a stranger once again  
Kiss me like a stranger once again  
I want to believe that our love's a mystery  
I want to believe that our love's a sin  
I want you to kiss me like a stranger once again  
  
You wear the same kind of perfume  
You wore when we met  
I suppose there's something comforting in knowing what to expect  
But when you brushed up against me  
Before I knew your name  
Everything was thrilling  
'Cause nothing was the same  
  
I want you to kiss me  
I want you to kiss me  
Like a stranger once again  
Kiss me like a stranger once again  
  
I want to believe our loves a mystery  
I want to believe our loves a sin  
Oh will you kiss me like a stranger once again  
I want you to kiss me like a stranger  
Kiss me like a stranger once again

I'm the last leaf on the tree  
The autumn took the rest  
But they won't take me  
I'm the last leaf on the tree  
  
When the autumn wind blows  
They're already gone  
They flutter to the ground  
'Cause they can't hang on  
There's nothing in the world  
That I ain't seen  
I greet all the new ones that are coming in green  
  
I'm the last leaf on the tree  
The autumn took the rest but they wont take me  
I'm the last leaf on the tree  
  
They say I got staying power  
Here on the tree  
But I've been here since Eisenhower  
And I've out lived even he  
  
I'm the last leaf on the tree  
The autumn took the rest but they won't take me  
I'm the last leaf on the tree  
  
I fight off the snow  
I fight off the hail  
Nothing makes me go  
I'm like some vestigial tail  
I'll be here through eternity  
If you want to know how long  
If they cut down this tree  
I'll show up in a song  
  
I'm the last leaf on the tree  
The autumn took the rest but they won't take me  
I'm the last leaf on the tree  
I'm the last leaf on the tree  
I'm the last leaf on the tree

Little boy blue  
Come blow your horn  
The dish ran away with the spoon  
Home again home again  
Saturday morn  
Never gets up before noon  
  
She used to render  
You legal and tender  
When you used to  
Send her your promises boy  
A dill or a dollar  
Unbutton your collar  
Come out and holler  
Out all of your noise  
  
Little boy blue  
Come blow your top  
Cut it right down to the quick  
Don't sit home and cry  
On the fourth of July  
Around now you're hittin' bricks  
  
So abracadabra  
Now she disappeared  
Now every thing's Canada dry  
So watch your behavior  
And rattle your cane  
With a bottle of bourbon  
Good-bye  
  
Little boy blow  
Lost little bo peep  
She fell through a hole in the nest  
Now ain't it peculiar  
That she's finally cooled your  
Big wheels just like all of the rest  
  
Whenever it rains  
The umbrella complain  
They're always gettin' played for a chump  
So mark and strike it  
She's history now  
And you're hangin' out at the pump  
  
Little boy blue  
She used to render

Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely eyes,  
lonely face, lonely lonely in your place.  
Lonely, lonely, lonely eyes, lonely face,  
lonely lonely in your place.  
  
I thought that I knew all that there was to,  
lonely, lonely, lonely  
  
Melanie Jane, won't feel the pain.  
Lonely, lonely, lonely eyes, lonely eyes,  
lonely lonely in your place.  
  
And I thought that I knew all that there was to  
Lonely, lonely, lonely eyes, lonely eyes,  
lonely lonely in your place, and  
I still love you, I still love you,  
lonely, lonely

I spent all my money in a mexican whorehouse,  
Across the street from a catholic church,  
And then I wiped off my revolver,  
And I buttoned up my burgundy shirt,  
  
I shot the morning in the back,  
With my red wings on,  
I told the sun he'd better go back down,  
And if I can find a book of matches,  
I'm goin' to burn this hotel down.  
  
You got to tell me brave captain,  
Why are the wicked so strong,  
How do the angels get to sleep,  
When the devil leaves the porchlight on.  
  
Well I dropped thirty grand on the nugget slots,  
I had to sell my ass on fremont street,  
And the drummer said there's sanctuary,  
Over at the Baghdad room,  
  
And now it's one for the money, two for the show,  
Three to get ready, and go man go,  
I said tell me mr. siegel,  
How do I get out of here.  
  
Well willard's knocked out on a bottle of heat,  
Drivin' dangerous curves across the dirty sheets,  
He said man you ought to see her,  
When her parents are gone,  
  
Man you ought to hear her when the siren's on.  
You got to tell me brave captain,  
Why are the wicked so strong,  
How do the angels get to sleep,  
When the devil leaves the porchlight on.  
  
Don't you know that ain't no broken bottle,  
That I picked up in my headlights,  
On the other side of the nevada line,  
Where they live hard die young,  
  
And have a good lookin' corpse every time,  
Well the pit-boss said I should keep movin',  
This is where you go when you die,  
And so I shot a black beauty,  
And I kissed her right between the eyes.  
  
Well willard's knocked out on a bottle of heat,  
Drivin' dangerous curves across the dirty sheets,  
He said man you ought to see her,  
When her parents are gone,  
Man you ought to hear her when the siren's on.  
  
You got to tell me brave captain,  
Why are the wicked so strong,  
How do the angels get to sleep,  
When the devil leaves the porch light on.

Muriel since you left town  
The clubs closed down  
And there's one more burned out lamppost  
On Main Street  
Down where we used to stroll  
  
And Muriel  
I still hit all the same old haunts  
And you follow me wherever I go  
  
And Muriel I see you  
On a Saturday night  
In a penny arcade  
With your hair tied back  
And the diamond twinkle  
Is in your eye  
Is the only wedding ring that I'll buy you  
Muriel  
  
And Muriel how many times  
I've left this town  
To hide from your memory  
And it haunts me  
  
But I only get as far  
As the next Whiskey bar  
I buy another cheap cigar  
And I'll see you every night  
  
Hey Muriel  
Muriel  
Hey buddy  
Got a light?

Let's put a new coat of paint  
On this lonesome old town  
Set 'em up, we'll be knockin' 'em down  
You wear a dress  
Baby I'll a tie  
We'll laugh at that old bloodshot moon  
In that burgundy sky  
  
All our scribbled love dreams are lost or thrown away  
Here amidst the shuffle of an overflowin' day  
Our love needs a transfusion let's shoot it full of wine  
Fishin' for a good time starts with throwin' in your line.  
  
So let's put a new coat of paint  
On this lonesome old town  
Set em' up, set em' up we'll be knockin' 'em down  
You wear a dress baby  
I'll wear a tie  
We'll laugh at that old bloodshot moon  
In that burgundy sky

Nobody, nobody, will ever love you  
The way that I love you  
Cause nobody's that strong  
Love's bittersweet, life's treasures deep  
No one can keep a love that's gone wrong  
  
Nobody, nobody, gonna love you  
The way I could  
Cause nobody's that strong  
No nobody's that strong  
  
Nobody, nobody, is gonna love you  
The way that I love you  
Cause nobody is that strong  
  
You've had many lovers,  
You'll have many others  
But they'll only just break  
Your poor heart in two  
And nobody, nobody, will love you  
The way I could  
Cause nobody's that strong,  
No nobody's that strong

No shadow  
No stars  
No moon  
No care  
November  
It only believes  
In a pile of dead leaves  
And a moon  
That's the color of bone  
  
No prayers for November  
To linger longer  
Stick your spoon in the wall  
We'll slaughter them all  
  
November has tied me  
To an old dead tree  
Get word to April  
To rescue me  
November's cold chain  
  
Made of wet boots and rain  
And shiny black ravens  
On chimney smoke lanes  
November seems odd  
You're my firing squad  
November  
  
With my hair slicked back  
With carrion shellac  
With the blood from a pheasant  
And the bone from a hare  
  
Tied to the branches  
Of a roebuck stag  
Left to wave in the timber  
Like a buck shot flag  
  
Go away you rainsnout  
Go away, blow your brains out  
November

On a foggy night, an abandoned road  
In a twilight mirror mirage  
With no indication of a service station  
Or an all night garage, I was misinformed  
I was misdirected cause the interchange  
Never intersected leaving me marooned  
Beneath a bloodshot moon  
All upon a foggy night, on a foggy night  
An abandoned road, in a blurred brocade  
Collage, is that a road motel?  
I can't really tell, is that what you  
Might call some kind of a vacancy lodge  
Cause there's no consolation, what  
Kind of situation to be aimlessly skewed  
Amidst a powder blue?  
No tell tail light clue  
Spun like the spell you spin  
This precarious pandemonium  
I'm stranded, all upon a foggy night  
All upon a foggy night  
On a foggy night

Sticks and stones will break my bones,  
But I always will be true,  
And when your mama is dead and gone,  
I'll sing this lullaby just for you.  
What becomes for the little boys,  
Who never comb their hair?  
They're lined up all around the block,  
On The Nickel over there.  
  
So you better bring a bucket,  
There is a hole in the pail.  
If you don't get my letter,  
Then you'll know that I'm in jail.  
What becomes for the little boys,  
Who never say their prayers?  
They're sleepin' like a baby,  
On The Nickel over there.  
  
If you chew tobacco, and wish upon a star,  
You'll find out where the scarecrows sit,  
Just like punchlines between the cars.  
I know a place where a royal flush,  
Can never beat a pair,  
And even Thomas Jefferson,  
Is On The Nickel over there.  
  
So ring around the rosie, you're sleepin' in the rain,  
And you're always late for supper,  
And man you let me down, let me down again.  
I thought I heard a mockingbird, Roosevelt knows where.  
You can skip the light with grady tuck,  
On the Nickel over there.  
  
So what become for the little boys,  
Who run away from home?  
The world just keeps gettin' bigger,  
Once you get out on your own.  
So here's to all the little boys,  
The sandman takes you where  
You'll be sleepin' with a pillowman,  
On the Nickel over there.  
  
So let's climb up through that button hole,  
And fall right up the stairs:  
I'll show you where the short dogs grow,  
On the Nickel over there.

Smelling like a brewery, looking like a tramp,  
I ain't got a quarter, got a postage stamp  
Been five o'clock shadow boxing all around the town,  
Talking with the old man, sleeping on the ground  
Bazanti bootin al zootin' al hoot and Al Cohn  
Sharing this apartment with a telephone pole  
And a fish-net stocking, spike-heel shoes,  
Strip tease, prick tease, car keys blues  
And the porno floor show, live nude girls,  
Dreamy and creamy and brunette curls  
Chesty Morgan and Watermelon Rose  
Raise my rent and take off all your clothes  
With trench coats, magazines, a bottle full of rum,  
She's so good, make a dead man come  
Pasties and a G-string, beer and a shot  
Portland through a shot glass and a Buffalo squeeze  
Wrinkles and Cherry and Twinkie and Pinkie and Fifi live from Gay Paree  
Fanfares, rim shots, back stage, who cares, all this hot burlesque for me  
(scat)  
Cleavage, cleavage, thighs and hips  
From the nape of her neck to the lipstick lips  
Chopped and channeled and lowered and louvred  
And the cheater slicks and baby moons  
She's a-hot and ready, creamy and sugared  
And the band is awful and so are the tunes  
(scat)  
Crawling on her belly, and shaking like jelly,  
And I'm getting harder than Chinese algebrassieres  
And cheers from the (hmm) compendium here  
"Hey sweetheart" they're yelling for more  
You're squashing out your cigarette butts on the floor  
And I like Shelly, and you like Jane  
And what was the girl with the snakeskin's name?  
And it's an early-bird matinee, come back any day,  
Get you a little something that you can't get at home  
Get you a little something that you can't get at home  
It's pasties and a G-string, beer and a shot  
Portland through a shot glass and a Buffalo squeeze  
Popcorn, front row, higher than a kite, and I'll be back tomorrow night,  
And I'll be back tomorrow night  
(scat)

They pay me not to come home  
Keeping me stoned  
I won't run away  
They say it's easy to get  
Stuck in this town  
Just like Joan  
  
You know I gave it all up for the stage  
They fill my cup up in the cage  
It's nobody's business but mine when I'm low  
To hold yourself up is not a crime here you know  
At the end of the world  
  
I kick my foot at the lights  
I breathe it in all night  
There's a light on a canvas tree  
Money from home supporting me  
  
They pay me not to come home  
I won't eat crow  
Ill stay away  
And though all roads will not lead you home, my girl  
All roads lead to the end of the world  
  
And I sewed a little luck up in the hem of my gown  
The only way down from the gallows is to swing  
And I'll wear boots instead of high heels  
And the next stage that I am on, it will have wheels

Well the stairs sound so lonely without you  
And I ain't made my bed in a week  
Coffee stains on the paper I'm writing  
And I'm too choked up inside to speak  
  
And Yes, I know our differences pulled us apart  
Never spoke a word heart to heart  
And I'm glad that you're gone  
But I wish to the lord that you'd come home  
And I'm glad that you're gone  
Got the feeling so strong  
And I'm glad that you're gone  
But I wish to the lord that you'd come home  
  
Well my guitar still plays your favorite song  
though the strings have been outta tune for some time  
Every time I strum a cord, I pray out to the lord  
That you'll quit your honkey-tonkin' sing my song  
And I'm glad that you're gone  
Got the feeling so strong  
And I'm glad that you're gone  
But I wish to the lord that you'd come home  
  
So I'll throw another log onto the fire  
And I'll admit I'm a lousy liar  
As the coals die down and flicker  
I hear that guitar picker  
Play the song we used to sing so long ago  
I'm glad that you're gone  
Got the feeling so strong  
And I'm glad that you're gone  
But I wish to the lord that you'd come home  
And I'm glad, damn glad you're gone  
Got the feeling so strong  
And I'm glad that you're gone  
But I wish to the lord that you'd come home
