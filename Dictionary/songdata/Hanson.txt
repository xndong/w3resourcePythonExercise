Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
It's not warm when she's away  
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
She's always gone too long  
Any time she goes away  
  
[Repeat x2]  
Wonder this time where she's gone  
Wonder if she's gonna stay  
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
And this house just ain't no home  
Any time she goes away  
  
And I know [Repeat x16]  
  
And I'll leave the young thing alone  
But ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
Only darkness everyday  
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
And this house just ain't no home  
Any time she goes away  
  
[Repeat x3]  
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
And she's always gone too long  
Anytime she goes away

So what am I supposed to do?  
Here I am, I'm losing you  
And this is more than I can take  
And as you walk away, baby all that I can say  
Is I'm sorry for being me  
  
I won't have to look into your eyes anymore  
It's alright, they don't look at me the same  
With all that I've lost I give everything and more  
If you want my love, speak  
  
So what am I supposed to do  
Here I am, I'm losing you  
And this is more than I can take  
And as you walk away, baby all that I can say  
Is I'm sorry for being me  
Yes I'm sorry for being me

I was holding on, now I'm letting go  
This is nothing more than a picture show  
Everything I knew now I hardly know  
Busy keeping less, never getting more  
  
One more nickel, dime, I'm out the door  
This kind of life I can't afford  
  
[Chorus]  
I want to believe  
There's something to believe  
I would live only  
Just to believe  
Oh, I'd love to believe  
It's not only me that's longing  
Only just to believe  
So believe  
'Cause I want to believe  
I want to believe  
  
Can't put my mind at ease with the words I say  
Trying to get myself to get out of my way  
Birds in the trees just make me depressed  
Seeing sunny skies, feeling emptiness  
  
Layers of lies just seem to fold  
This kind of life is all I know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Murder wears a friendly smile  
Like the perfect end in a plastic vial  
No pain  
Sorry, I can't seem to stay  
But this bird was meant to fly away  
Fly away, fly away  
  
Layers of lies just seem to fold  
This kind of life is all I know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I will believe  
I'd love to believe  
I can believe in something  
I will believe  
I'd love to believe  
I can't believe in nothing

Been together for so long my friend  
Now you tell me that you'll be going away  
So many people in so many ways  
Drawn by you in all the things you've had to say  
  
And now I know where you're going to  
Hope you find your way  
I'll say  
  
What's forever if you're gone?  
Give me the strenght to carry on  
When you see me walking by  
I'll hold my head uphigh  
And think of the times when we were young  
When our love had just begun  
Only you can stop the pain  
But our love will always remain  
  
Sit and wonder about the things we've said  
And times we've had and the games we played  
Look back now and remember the days we laughed  
The moments we cried and the love we made  
And now I know where you're going to  
I'll see you there someday  
I'll say  
  
What's forever if you're gone?  
Give me the strenght to carry on  
When you see me walking by  
I'll hold my head uphigh  
And think of the times when we were young  
When our love had just begun  
Only you can stop the pain  
But our love will always remain  
  
Every time that I'd see you smile  
My whole world would be bright  
If I just had the power I'd keep you a while  
Then I'd know it's all right  
And I know where you're going to  
I'll see you there someday  
I'll say  
  
What's forever if you're gone?  
Give me the strenght to carry on  
When you see me walking by  
I'll hold my head uphigh  
And think of the times when we were young  
When our love had just begun  
Only you can stop the pain  
But our love will always remain

I'm blind with eyes wide open  
My body's tired and broken  
I want a taste of something, that doesn't leave me dry  
This hope for answered questions  
As rare as true conviction  
I stare into the distance, there is no truth in sight  
Who can tell me why  
Everybody's looking for a blue sky  
Searching for an answer on a satellite  
I know that there's got to be a blue sky out there to see  
A blue sky waiting for me  
I've seen the main attraction  
I've felt the moment's passion  
I won't be no soap box teacher, just taking your time  
Just taking your time  
Who can tell me why  
Everybody's looking for a blue sky  
Searching for an answer on a satellite  
I know that there's got to be a blue sky out there to see  
A blue sky  
Everywhere I go, it feels like I'm always searching for something  
'Til I know for sure, I'll be right here waiting for something  
More, more, for something more, for something more  
Everybody's looking for a blue sky  
Searching for an answer on a satellite  
I know that there's got to be a blue sky out there to see  
Somewhere there's a blue sky waiting  
Everybody's looking for a blue sky  
Searching for an answer on a satellite  
I know that there's got to be a blue sky waiting for me  
A blue sky  

Somethin' special about you, babe  
Maybe it's your smile  
But when I see you  
You hear the dial  
Oh, girl  
  
[Chorus]  
Big bang it hit me like a boomerang  
Light turns green, blood starts flowin'  
Big bang it hit me like a boomerang  
Light turns green and my heart starts pumpin'  
  
Maybe somehow in my make-believe world  
Maybe somehow you will be my girl  
And I understand there are other guys  
But when I see you my blood pressure starts to rise  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Big bang, buh dah bah bah duh bang  
Big bang, buh dah bah bah duh bang  
Big bang, buh dah bah bah duh bang  
Big bang, buh dah bah bah duh bang  
Big bang, buh dah bah bah duh bang  
Big bang, buh dah bah bah duh bang  
Big Bang  
Big Bang  
  
I see girls in all shapes and sizes  
But, baby, since I met you, you're the only one for me  
  
[Chorus: x4]

Are you ready to lose?  
Are you ready to win?  
Well I've been losing for so long  
I can't begin  
  
I'm a man on the moon  
I'm a man on the edge  
Well I'm the words you never knew were in your head  
To be read  
  
You can't help you're so insecure  
Your hurt right down to the core  
You're only stuck in your pain today  
Welcome to Breaktown  
  
For the first time  
It's a great town  
For your worst time  
When you freak out  
There's a road sign  
Welcome to Breaktown  
  
Are you ready to quit?  
Are you ready to learn?  
Are you ready to find the spark inside and let it burn?  
I'm the walls that close in  
I'm the words you won't say  
I'm the voice you choose to keep inside  
And lock away  
Everyday  
  
You keep it all to yourself  
You're just like everyone else  
So take a good look around  
Now.... Welcome to Breaktown  
  
For the first time  
It's a great town  
For your worst time  
When you freak out  
There's a road sign  
Welcome to Breaktown  
  
When you're driving through  
There's a room with a view  
Just hanging around  
Yeah!  
Woahhhhhh  
Yeah!  
  
Welcome to Breaktown  
Welcome to Breaktown  
Welcome to Breaktown  
  
For the first time  
It's a great town  
For your worst time  
When you freak out  
There's a road sign  
Welcome to Breaktown  
  
Welcome to Breaktown  
Welcome to Breaktown  
Welcome to Breaktown, Breaktown

Whoa, whoa, ohhhhh, whoa, oh  
  
You can only push someone so far  
You can only break so many hearts  
We used to be love one another  
Now it's lust for your lover  
Baby, I was trying to burn bridges of stone  
Yeah  
  
Chorus:  
You can only wait  
You can only wait so long  
You can only wait  
You can only wait so long  
In this game we play  
Can't tell right from wrong  
You can only wait so long  
  
Here come the memories of yesterday  
Here's the poetry  
Of all those things I couldn't even say  
You can only wait so long  
Before your flower petals are all gone  
Baby, I was trying to burn bridges of stone  
Ain't nobody crying for what used to be home  
Yeah  
  
[Repeat Chorus]  
  
Ohhh  
  
Why couldn't you hold on to me?  
I was right here  
Laying in our bed  
Said, ohh  
All those things I didn't see  
All those things I never should of said  
  
You can only push someone so far  
You can only break so many hearts  
You can only wait so long  
Before your flower petals are all gone  
Baby, I was trying to burn bridges of stone.  
  
[Repeat Chorus]  
  
Whoa, Whoa  
  
Why couldn't you call out for me  
It's not like I was ever far away  
Said, ohhh  
Tie me to the edge and start to leap  
There's nothing left here  
But a million words to say  
  
We all have memories  
And I have spent my time in vain  
Here's to our enemies  
And I will leave you with no pain  
We will find a way somehow  
In this running just to know goodbye  
Baby, I was trying to burn bridges of stone  
You won't find me crying for what used to be home  
  
[Repeat Chorus]  
  
In this game we play  
We can't tell right from wrong  
Cause you can only wait so long  
In this game we play  
We can't tell right from wrong  
Cause you can only wait so long

Good morning, I'm alone  
My joy's on the shelf  
Because my broken heart  
Can't mend more of itself  
  
Today your hope is gone  
He took it when he left  
Well, his promise to hold on  
Never could be kept  
  
So just pick up the phone  
And call me  
When you find yourself alone  
Just call me  
  
I love the way I find  
Your eyes to be so kind  
And it's funny how they seem  
To stare straight through me  
  
So if you wake up today  
Forgetting what you have  
And you find that you feel lost  
I'll be your ticket back  
  
Just pick up the phone  
And call me  
When you find yourself alone  
Just call me  
  
Just call me baby

I saw what you did that's untold  
Glass of wine in her hand  
I knew she would make her connection  
At her feet was a full loose man  
Chorus:  
You can't always get what you want,  
You can't always get what you want,  
You can't always get what you want,  
But if you try sometimes you just might find  
You'll get what you need.  
You'll get what you need  
Well I went down to the demonstration  
Just to get my best share of abuse  
Singing 'were gonna bounce our frustration  
And if we don't, we're gonna blow a 50-amp fuse'  
Chorus:  
You can't always get what you want,  
You can't always get what you want,  
You can't always get what you want,  
But if you try sometimes you just might find  
You'll get what you need.  
You'll get what you need  
Well I went to the Chelsea drugstore  
Just to get your prescribtion filled  
I was in line with Mr. Jimmy  
And man, man did he look ill  
We decided that we should get a cola  
My favorite flavor cherry red  
I sang my song to Mr. Jimmy  
And he said one word to me and that was 'dead'  
And I said to him  
Chorus:  
You can't always get what you want,  
You can't always get what you want,  
You can't always get what you want,  
But if you try sometimes you just might find  
You'll get what you need.  
You'll get what you need.  
I saw what you did in Reception  
In a glass was a bleeding man  
She was practice in the arts of deception  
You can tell by the blood stains on her hands  
Chorus:  
You can't always get what you want,  
You can't always get what you want,  
You can't always get what you want,  
But if you try sometimes you might find  
You'll get what you need.  
Chorus:  
You can't always get what you want,  
You can't always get what you want,  
You can't always get what you want,  
But if you try sometimes you might find  
You'll get what you need.  
You'll get what you need

Well, I don't care what you say  
I don't have use for your words anyway  
You don't need a Cadillac  
'Cause I'll be waiting with my bare back  
To carry you there  
  
Try and you don't have to be afraid  
To just rely  
On someone to hold away part of you child  
It's all right  
You can get too much to handle by yourself  
If you can't do it alone, I know you will say  
I don't know what's at stake  
Or what it takes  
  
Well, I don't care what you say  
I don't have use for your words anyway  
You don't need a Cadillac  
'Cause I'll be waiting with my bare back  
To carry you there  
  
Turn around  
And you just might see the good  
You've left behind  
But you're all caught up  
In what's still left to find  
And it's never enough  
So slow down  
And the root of what you're feeling might appear  
When all the pushin' up the hill has brought you here  
And you're used up  
To the line  
If you tell me you are fine  
  
Well, I don't care what you say  
I don't have use for your words anyway  
You don't need a Cadillac  
'Cause I'll be waiting (I'll be waiting)  
To carry you there  
Oh yeah  
  
Say, don't be too proud  
I'm holding my hand out  
You've been my friend on darker days  
See, I'll still be there  
Despite your despair  
And I don't really care what you say  
Hey, hey, hey  
  
[Repeat: x11]  
I will carry you there

Cecilia, you're breaking my heart  
You're shaking my confidence daily  
Oh, Cecilia, I'm down on my knees  
I'm begging you please to come home  
  
Oh, Cecilia, you're breaking my heart  
You're shaking my confidence daily  
Oh, Cecilia, I'm down on my knees  
I'm begging you please to come home  
Come on home  
  
Making love in the afternoon with Cecilia  
Up in my bedroom (making love)  
I got up to wash my face  
When I come back to bed  
Someones taken my place  
  
Oh, Cecilia, you're breaking my heart  
You're shaking my confidence daily  
Oh, Cecilia, I'm down on my knees  
I'm begging you please to come home  
Come on home  
  
Jubilation, she loves me again,  
I fall on the floor and I'm laughing,  
Jubilation, she loves me again,  
I fall on the floor and I'm laughing

They're singing 'deck the halls'  
But it's not like christmas at all  
I remember when you were here  
And all the fun that we had last year  
  
The snow's coming down  
Now I'm watching it fall  
All the people around  
Baby please come home  
  
The church bells in town  
All ringing in song  
Full of happy sounds  
Baby please come home  
  
They're singing 'deck the halls'  
But it's not like christmas at all  
I remember when you were here  
And all the fun that we had last year  
  
Now the snow's coming down  
Now I'm watching it fall  
Lot's of people around  
Baby please come home  
(won't you please, oh)  
  
They're singing 'deck the halls'  
But it's not like christmas at all  
I remember when you were here  
And all the fun that we had last year  
  
The snow's coming down  
Now I'm watching it fall  
All the people around  
Baby, baby, baby please come home  
  
Baby please come home  
Baby please come home  
Baby please come home  
Now I'm feeling all alone  
  
Oh the snow's coming down  
Now I'm watching it fall...

Liquid, melancholy dreams  
Tell me what it means  
'Cause you drive me crazy  
Driftwood, won't you float me down your stream?  
Tell me what it means  
  
'Cause you drive me crazy  
'Cause you're crazy beautiful  
'Cause you're crazy beautiful  
'Cause you're crazy beautiful  
  
Don't go looking in my eyes tonight  
Don't go telling me lies tonight  
Don't go promising the skies tonight  
When you're crazy  
'Cause you're crazy beautiful  
'Cause you're crazy beautiful  
  
Listen, all I need is you  
Won't you tell me what to do?  
'Cause you drive me crazy  
Baby, is it pulling on your heart?  
Is it tearing you apart?  
  
'Cause you drive me crazy  
'Cause you're crazy beautiful  
'Cause you're crazy beautiful  
  
Don't go looking in my eyes tonight  
Don't go telling me lies tonight  
Don't go promising the skies tonight  
When you're crazy  
'Cause you're crazy beautiful  
'Cause you're crazy beautiful  
'Cause you're crazy beautiful  
  
If you don't need me, I think I'll go  
If you don't want me, tell me no  
If you don't need me, I think I'll go  
Oh, oh, oh  
  
Don't go looking in my eyes tonight  
Don't go telling me lies tonight  
Don't go promising the skies tonight  
When you're crazy  
'Cause you're crazy beautiful  
'Cause you're crazy beautiful  
'Cause you're crazy beautiful

You promised not to say a word  
You promised you would keep it quiet  
But you and I both knew it  
It was written all over your face  
So I cried.. Ohyah....  
The day you said goodbye  
So I cried..  
The day that our love died  
The day you said goodbye....... Died.....  
We had a love I thought could last  
I guess I was thinking four leaf clovers  
But you wished we were over  
Now I've lost three and I only got one  
So I cried.. Ohyah....  
The day you said goodbye.. Ohyah....  
So I cried..  
You cried..... I cried..  
The day you said goodbye....... Yah.....  
Let's not even bother be talking about  
It doesn't really matter to you  
So get it on....... Baby  
Get it on....... Baby.... Ohhow  
A secret's something that you keep  
And a heart is something you hold on to  
But you play by your own rules  
And one day it will blow up in your face  
So you cry... Ohyah....  
The day he says goodbye  
The day that your love died  
You cried..... Ohhh  
The day he says goodbye  
So you cry... Ohyah....  
The day he says goodbye  
You cried....  
The day that your love died  
The day he says goodbye, goodbye, goodbye  
So you cry... Ohhhoow....  
The day he says goodbye  
So you cry... Ohhhoow....  
The day he says goodbye  
So I cry... Ohhhoow....  
The day he says  
  
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye,  
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye,  
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye,  
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye,  
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye,  
Goodbye, goodbye  
Here's to you............. Goodbye

You jump in front of my car  
When you know all the time  
That 90 miles an hour Girl Is the speed I drive  
You tell me it's all right  
You don't mind a little pain  
You say you just want me to take you for a drive  
You're just like crosstown traffic  
So hard to get through you crosstown traffic  
I don't need to run over you crosstown traffic  
All you do is slow me down  
But I'm tryin' to get on the other side of town  
I'm not the only soul who's accused of hit and run  
Tire tracks all across your back I can see you've had your fun  
But a-darling  
Can't you see my signal's turn from green to red  
And with you I can see a traffic jam straight ahead  
You're just like crosstown traffic  
So hard to get through you crosstown traffic  
I don't need to run over you crosstown traffic  
All you do is slow me down  
But I got better things on the other side of town  
Yeah Yeah Crosstown traffic  
Look out look out Look out Baby  
Coming through crosstown traffic  
Yeah Yeah Look out crosstown traffic  
Yeah Yeah look out Look out Look out Baby  
Crosstown traffic look out yeah

Won't deny everything can't last  
But it's closing in so fast  
Thought that I'd figured it out at last  
But you can't change the past  
And it's closing in so fast  
Feels just like we're dancing in the wind  
Feeling just all right  
When we're dancing in the wind  
We can dance all night  
Just don't walk away  
When I've got you in my arms tonight  
And I've got something to say  
There are still rules to break  
And this music is a place to hide  
Isn't it just a game we play  
Feels just like we're dancing in the wind  
Feeling just all right  
When we're dancing in the wind  
We can dance all night  
We can dance all night  
We can dance all night  
When we're dancing in the wind  
We can dance all night  
Feels just like we're dancing in the wind  
Feeling just alright  
When we're dancing in the wind  
We can dance all night  
We can dance all night  
We can dance all night  
When we're dancing in the wind  
We can dance all night  
We can dance all night  
We can dance all night  
When we're dancing in the wind  
We can dance all night

She moves with a tender kiss  
And I can't stop feelin'  
She soothes with a tenderness  
And I can't stop' feelin'  
Well, I don't even know her name  
But I can't stop feelin'  
She says that she feels the same  
And I can't stop feelin'  
And if you let me try tonight  
You just might see that I'm  
  
Fallin' deeper and deeper and deeper in love  
And I'm feelin' more and more and more and more alone  
Ah yeah  
  
She turns chaos into art  
And I can't stop feelin'  
A touch and I fall apart  
And I can't stop feelin'  
It's soundin' like an old cliche  
And I can't stop feelin'  
I love her in a thousand ways  
And I can't stop feelin'  
And if you let me try tonight  
You just might see that I'm  
  
Fallin' deeper and deeper and deeper in love  
And I'm feelin' more and more and more and more alone  
Ah yeah  
  
Well, every simple notion is poetry in motion  
Can't you see it's pushin' me over the edge?  
This wreckin' ball you're holdin' has crushed the heart you've stolen  
I'll give you my devotion all over again  
And if you let me try tonight  
You just might see that I'm  
  
That I'm fallin' deeper and deeper and deeper in love  
And I'm feelin' more and more and more and more alone  
Yeah  
  
And I'm fallin' deeper and deeper and deeper in love  
And I'm feelin' more and more and more and more alone  
  
And I'm fallin' deeper and deeper and deeper in love  
And I'm feelin' more and more and more and more alone  
Ah yeah

Oh, I'm overdue, give me some room  
I'm coming through  
Paid my dues, in the mood  
Me and the girls gonna shake the room  
  
Dj's spinning, show your hands  
Let's get dirrty, that's my jam  
I need that, uh, to get me off  
Sweat until my clothes come off  
  
It's explosive, speakers are pumping  
Still jumping, six in the morning  
Table dancing, glasses are mashing  
No question, time for some action  
  
Temperature's up, can you feel it?  
About to erupt, gonna get my girls  
Get your boys  
Gonna make some noise  
  
Wanna get rowdy  
Gonna get a little unruly  
Get it fired up in a hurry  
Wanna get dirrty  
  
It's about time that I came to start the party  
Sweat dripping over my body  
Dancing gettin' just a little naughty  
Wanna get dirrty, it's about time for my arrival

Don't accuse

There was a boy, he was lame  
He had a limp in his leg  
People looked at him with a frown  
He said why do you put me down  
No no no no don't accuse  
You don't know what they've been through  
No no no no don't accuse  
You don't know what they've been through  
How would you like it if I hurt you  
Way deep inside  
And looked at you with a frown  
Would you feel all alone  
No one comes over to help you  
It seems like nobody cares  
Maybe next time you'll think twice  
Before you accuse or compare  
(repeat chorus)  
When you prick us do we not bleed  
When you whip us do we not weep  
When you hurt us do we not cry  
When you stab us do we not die  
(repeat chorus 4x)  

Tell me that you love me  
You say you don't but you don't know  
See you in my dreams  
And you are so fair  
I tried so hard to find you  
But you were never there  
You're my dream girl  
And none can compare  
You're always with me  
In our kingdom far away  
You will be her majesty  
And together we will reign  
You're my dream girl  
It'll always be that way  
Whoa whoa whoa whoa yeah  
Whoa whoa whoa whoa yeah  
Walking into the night  
Just waiting to hear you say  
Everything will be alright  
And I will be okay  
You're my dream girl  
It'll always be that way  
Whoa Whoa Whoa Whoa Yeah  
Whoa Whoa Whoa Whoa Yeah  
You'll always be that way  
No matter what they say  
You'll always be that way  
No matter what they say  
You'll always be that way  
No matter what they say yeah  
You say you don't want to  
Tell me that you love me  
You say you don't but you don't know  
You'll always be that way  
No matter what they say  
You'll always be that way  
No matter what they say  
You'll always be that way  
No matter what they say  
You're my dream girl  
You'll always be that way  
Wear you down  
you say you don't  
wear you down  
you say you don't  
You say you don't want to tell me  
that you love me  
You say you don't but you don't know  
You'll always be that way  
You'll always be that way  
You'll always be that way

I heard you crying  
Somebody stole my soul  
How could I be dying?  
I turned twenty five days ago yeah  
Were all on the ground just crying out  
Would somebody save me please.  
I won't, sit around just thinkin' bout, the troubles that tomorrow brings yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm dying to be alive yeah  
I'm dying to be alive yeah  
Lets not go through our lives  
With out just dying to be alive  
  
The people you've touched  
They way you've touched them  
I hope they'd've touched you too.  
'cause in this life, its hard to tell  
What's false and what is true yea  
Were all on the ground just cryin' out  
Would somebody save me please  
I won't sit around just thinking about  
The troubles that tomorrow brings  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And we all come tumbling down  
No matter how strong we all return to the ground  
Another day gone  
A day closer to fate  
And soon we'll find it's a little bit too late  
  
The things you see, the way you see them  
Will never be seen again  
Let's go through life livin' on luck  
Betting ten thousand to ten  
Mistakes I've made in this life  
I can't say why or when  
But the thing that's strange is you only live once  
I'll never look back again yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And we all come tumbling down  
No matter how strong  
We all return to the ground  
In the days to come you'll say why did I wait  
You can't just leave your life up to fate.  
You've gotta turn it around before it's too late.

  
She's walking round in emptiness  
She's missing out  
All the goods she left in her prom dress  
She can't take back all her regrets  
Her only hope is what she did  
She'll soon forget  
  
The sky's a blur  
My drug, my friend  
Sometimes you can't avoid the lonesome bitter end  
She's breathing in some nicotine  
And when she's down,  
She'll drown this town in kerosene  
  
This must be the end of the line  
This must be the end of the line  
This must be the end of the line  
  
The ganja boys  
They like it there  
Maybe the truth is just  
Enough for you too bear  
You can't avoid a compromise  
Maybe this is a state of reflection  
Of what's on your mind  
  
This must be the end of the line  
This must be the end of the line  
  
Even all this time we're still making it fine  
Even all this time we're still making it fine  
Even all this time we're still making it fine  
  
This must be the end of the line  
This must be the end of the line  
This must be the end of the line  
  
You can't avoid a compromise  
This must be the end of the line  
You can't avoid what's on your mind  
This must be the end of the line  
You can't avoid a compromise  
This must be the end of the line  
This must be the end of the line  
  
She's walking round in emptiness  
She's looking for the goods  
She left in her prom dress

[Chorus]  
If you're ever lonely you can call on me  
I'll be here for you all you've got to do is call  
I'm always waiting here for you  
All you've got to do is keep on trying till your call gets through  
  
For so many years I have been your friend  
And we've through everything time and time again  
But I want you to know that I still believe in you  
All you've got to do is keep on trying till your call gets through  
  
You've gotta keep trying even though the road gets hard  
You've gotta keep going on even though he broke your heart  
And if you ever need a friend I will be here for you  
All you've got to do is keep on trying till your call gets through  
  
[Chorus]

Don't you smell the cookies he's bakin'  
Can't you see that belly, it's shakin'  
Don't take a cookie off of that pan  
You don't want to mess with this man.  
  
You've never seen this side of him before  
You know he won't be knockin' at your door  
  
Here comes Santa Claus  
Doin' all those good things  
Everybody know the cause  
Here comes Santa Claus  
You know he's the big man  
Don't mess with the boss  
  
Ask Rudolph and he won't steer you wrong  
Santa wasn't this fat all along  
Until he started cookin one day  
Don't try and take that turkey away  
  
Here comes Santa Claus  
Doin' all those good things  
Everybody know the cause  
Here comes Santa Claus  
You know he's the big man  
Don't mess with the boss  
  
Cruisin' down the air highway on his sleigh  
Bringing all the presents for the next day  
Don't forget the donuts  
  
His cookies and his milk are his pride  
Or anything that can be deep-fried  
Don't get me wrong Santa's a nice guy  
But you don't want to get on his bad side  
  
Here comes Santa Claus  
Doin' all those good things  
Everybody know the cause  
Here comes Santa Claus  
You know he's the big man  
Don't mess with the boss

You feel like liberation  
You give me new sensation  
You show me what I need and  
You are my life completed  
  
Can't stop, can't break, who's driving?  
Sometimes there's no denying  
Till today I feel I can't lose  
I'm letting go of what I knew  
  
I want you for always  
I hear your name in every word I say  
I'm a fool and I don't care  
I hear your name in every word I say  
  
Before you I was only  
What I let control me  
You are a revolution  
Against my own conclusions  
Till today I feel I can't lose  
I'm letting go of what I knew  
  
I want you for always  
I hear your name in every word I say  
I'm a fool and I don't care  
I hear your name in every word I say  
  
And now I say goodbye to the way I used to be  
There is no room for question  
Cause your name it sets me free  
Yesterday's troubles harm me  
Today's are creeping in  
So let go of the world around me  
Cause your love is all I need  
  
I want you for always  
I hear your name in every word I say  
I'm a fool and that's okay  
I hear your name in every word I say  
  
I want you for always  
I hear your name in every word I say  
I'm a fool and I don't care  
I hear your name in every word I say  
  
Every word I say  
Every word I say  
In every word I say  
  
I hear your name in every word I say  
I hear your name in every word I say  
I hear your name in every word I say  
I hear your name well all I hear is your name  
All I hear is your name  
All I hear is your name  
And no one can take it away

We sit secure in time-honored traditions made  
Never wondering where or when the sickle may come  
If we don't seek our knowledge to be greater men  
When the rain starts falling gonna drown before we get our feet wet  
  
We build our ivory towers to protect us from the flood  
A fleet of vessels made of wood so they won't rust  
But can we see the bottom of the bottle when we start to drink?  
There's fire on the mountain fire and it's coming our way  
  
Can we pick the pieces up  
We're mending Babylon  
Tryin' to right the wrong  
Can we pick the pieces up  
  
Live learn life love die dust gone  
  
There's fire on the mountain  
  
Can we pick the pieces up  
We're mending Babylon  
Tryin' to right the wrong  
Can we pick the pieces up  
  
Live learn life love die dust gone

The earth is shaking under siege  
And every breath we'll meet is fate  
Still we hunger for a moment of freedom  
Even though the hour is late  
I find hope and it gives me rest  
I find hope in a beating chest  
I find hope in what eyes don't see  
I find hope in your hate for me  
Have no fear when the waters rise  
We can conquer this great divide  
When every eye is one the fortune  
It can only breed contempt  
They say blood is thicker than oceans  
Still we box our brothers in  
I find hope and it gives me rest  
I find hope in a beating chest  
I find hope in what eyes don't see  
I find hope in your hate for me  
Have no fear when the waters rise  
We can conquer this great divide  
Whoa, ooo, ooo, ooo ooo  
Whoa, ooo, ooo, ooo ooo  
Whoa, ooo, ooo, ooo ooo  
And we're gone  
And we're gone  
And we're, holding on  
And we're, holding on  
And we're, holding on  
I find hope and it gives me rest  
I find hope in a beating chest  
I find hope in what eyes don't see  
I find hope in your hate for me  
Have no fear when the waters rise  
We can conquer this great divide  
Whoa, ooo, ooo, ooo ooo  
Whoa, ooo, ooo, ooo ooo  
Whoa, ooo, ooo, ooo ooo  

One, two, three four...  
  
You know that I want you  
You know that I need you too  
When you look at me I hope you believe  
That what I say is true  
So I'm gonna show ya  
The feelings I have for you  
But you need to know I have no control  
Of the things you make me do  
Well I know you don't understand  
Would you please just give me your hand  
(Hand, hand, hand, hand...)  
  
I don't know how much more I can take (more I can take)  
I'm stuck in a dream and I don't want to wake (don't want to wake)  
Is this real or is this a mistake?  
I know one thing this is true  
I couldn't want anyone half as bad as you  
  
You say that you want me  
You say that you need me too  
But you can't mean the words you say  
The way I know I do  
I said that I love you  
I tell them you're mine  
They just turn and walk away  
It happens all the time  
But I know they don't understand  
Would you please just give me your hand  
(Hand, hand, hand, hand...)  
  
I don't know how much more I can take (more I can take)  
Stuck in a dream and I don't want to wake (don't want to wake)  
This is real and it ain't no mistake  
I know one thing this is true  
I couldn't want anyone half as bad as you  
  
I hope these words get your attention  
Sometimes I get carried away  
With what I say is it okay-ay-ay-ayy?  
  
I don't know how much more I can take  
Stuck in a dream and I don't want to wake  
'Cause this is real and it's not a mistake  
I know one thing this is true  
You love me and I love you  
I couldn't want anyone half as bad as you

I know just how much I love you  
But there is no time to explain  
I realize just what I'd give to  
Get you back in my arms  
  
And I see you hand in hand with another man  
And I don't know what you see in him and why you let us go  
  
So if you're gonna lie  
At least you could just let us die  
And if you're gonna cry to me baby  
At least you could just say goodbye  
  
And I'm caught between myself and me  
And I can't find the bridge  
From my mind to reality  
I'm trying to find a place in the sun  
But I'm drowning in the rain  
That's falling every place I run  
  
And I see you hand in hand with another man  
And I don't know what you see in him and why you let us go  
  
So if you're gonna lie  
At least you could just let us die  
And if you're gonna cry to me baby  
At least you could just say goodbye  
  
Well I'm not gonna sit around just waiting for you to get overhim  
So oh, no, no, no  
Say goodbye  
Say goodbye now  
Say goodbye  
Say goodbye now  
Say goodbye  
Say goodbye now  
Say goodbye now  
  
Well if you're gonna lie  
Well at least you could just let us die  
And if you're gonna cry to me baby  
At least you could just said goodbye  
  
Say goodbye  
Say goodbye now  
Say goodbye  
  
Oh yeah  
  
Won't you say goodbye  
Won't you say goodbye now  
Won't you say goodbye  
Say goodbye  
Say goodbye  
Say goodbye  
Say goodbye now  
Say goodbye  
Say goodbye now  
Say goodbye  
Say goodbye now  
Say goodbye now  
  
Won't you kiss me goodbye  
You've gotta tell me goodbye  
  
Say goodbye  
Say goodbye now  
Say goodbye  
Say goodbye now

I Almost Care  
Even though I hurt you all the time  
You're on my mind, I won't deny  
Everything I did I take it back  
I'll make it right, at least I'll try  
Now there's only one thing on my mind  
It's taken me some time girl  
I'm ready now to lay it on the line  
I hope you want to try still, you know I will  
Don't give up when you're so close  
Don't give up when you're almost there  
Don't give up when you're so close  
I almost care, I almost care  
I admit I don't know why you'd stay  
I've tried so hard to push you away  
I'm saying all the words you used to say  
It's turned around, you've turned away  
Now there's only one thing on my mind  
It's taken me some time girl  
I'm ready now to lay it on the line  
I hope you want to try still, you know I will  
Don't give up when you're so close  
Don't give up when you're almost there  
Don't give up when you're so close  
I almost care  
Don't give up when you almost care  
Now there's only one thing on my mind  
I hope you want to try still, you know I will  
Don't give up when you're so close  
Don't give up when you're almost there  
Don't give up when you're so close  
I almost care  

I want you to want me.  
I need you to need me.  
I'd love you to love me.  
I'm beggin' you to beg me.  
I want you to want me.  
I need you to need me.  
I'd love you to love me.  
I'll shine up the old brown shoes, put on a brand-new shirt.  
I'll get home early from work if you say that you love me.  
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you cryin'?  
Oh, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you cryin'?  
Feelin' all alone without a friend, you know you feel like dyin'.  
Oh, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you cryin'?  
I want you to want me.  
I need you to need me.  
I'd love you to love me.  
I'm beggin' you to beg me.  
I'll shine up the old brown shoes, put on a brand-new shirt.  
I'll get home early from work if you say that you love me.  
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you cryin'?  
Oh, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you cryin'?  
Feelin' all alone without a friend, you know you feel like dyin'.  
Oh, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you cryin'?  
Feelin' all alone without a friend, you know you feel like dyin'.  
Oh, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you cryin'?  
I want you to want me.  
I need you to need me.  
I'd love you to love me.  
I'm beggin' you to beg me.  
I want you to want me.  
I want you to want me.  
I want you to want me.  
I want you to want me

In a little while  
Surely you'll be mine  
In a little while I'll be there  
  
In a little while  
This hurt will hurt no more  
I'll be home, love  
  
When the night takes a deep breath  
And the daylight has no end  
If I crawl, if I come crawling home  
Will you be there  
  
In a little while  
I will blow by every breeze  
Friday night running  
To Sunday on my knees  
  
That girl, that girl  
She's mine  
And I've know her since  
Since you were a little girl  
With Spanish eyes  
Oh, when I saw her  
In a pram they pushed her by  
  
My how you've grown  
Well it's been  
It's been a little while  
  
Slow down my bleeding heart  
Man dreams one day to fly  
A man takes a rocketship into the skys  
He lives on starlets dying in the night  
And follows in the trail  
The scatter of light  
  
Slow down my bleeding heart  
Slowly, slowly love  
Slow down my bleeding heart  
Slowly, slowly love  
Slow down my beating heart  
Slowly, slowly love

I see you walking out that door  
And you know you can hide no more  
If I asked you now  
I know you wouldn't give it up  
  
If I asked you how, you'd give that look to kill  
Oh, it gives you a chill  
But, oh, it gives me a thrill to say  
  
[Chorus]  
Do you love me, do you love me, do you love me, little pretty?  
Can you tell me, can you tell me  
What's going on in the city?  
  
Sittin' there, tryin' to look so sweet  
Every word you say is full of deceit  
  
If I asked you how, you'd give that look to kill  
Oh, it gives you a chill  
But, oh, it gives me a thrill to say  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm gonna ask you once again  
Gotta tell me once again, do you love me?  
Gotta tell me once again, do you love me?  
Gotta tell me once again, do you love me?  
  
Do you love me, do you love me?  
  
[Chorus: x4]  
  
I'm gonna ask  
You once again, you gotta tell me once again, do you love me?

She plays Wipeout on the drums  
The squirrels and the birds come  
Gather round to sing the guitar  
Oh I...Have you got nothing to say?  
  
When all words fail she speaks  
Her mix tape's a masterpiece  
Walks through the garden  
So the roses can see  
Oh I...Have you got nothing to say?  
  
And you can see the daisies in her footsteps  
Dandelions, butterflies  
I wanna be Kate  
Kate...Kate...Kate  
  
Everyday she wears the same thing  
I think she smokes pot  
She's everything I want  
She's everything I'm not  
Oh I...Have you got nothing to say?  
  
She never gets wet  
She smiles and it's a rainbow  
And she speaks  
And she breathes  
I wanna be Kate  
  
Down by Rosemary and Cameron  
She hands out the Bhagavad-Gita  
I see her around every couple days  
I wanna meet her so I can say...hey Kate  
  
ooh la la la  
ooh la la la  
ooh la la la la  
  
She never gets wet  
She smiles and it's a rainbow  
You can see  
I wanna wanna wanna be Kate  
Kate...Kate...Kate  
Na Na Kate  
Kate...Kate...Kate  
Na Na Na Na Na Na

I'll never walk away from this  
I'll pull you closely to my chest  
With a fathers breaking heart  
I'll walk you one last time into the dark  
  
There are no reasons to explain  
A silent killer bears no blame  
There are no answers though I pray  
I die though this is not my grave  
  
And I lay you down  
Lay you down  
  
I'll carry you child to a place where you can rest  
Sweet tears that seep into the linens  
As I put you down to bed  
It tears me into pieces  
Watching you fight to fill your lungs with breath  
There's no need to struggle  
There's no need to struggle  
  
I lay you down  
Lay you down  
Don't you cry no more  
I'll lay me down  
Lay me down  
  
Well I'm not ready  
I'm not ready for this  
I'm not ready, I'm not ready for this  
  
There are no branches from this soil  
My broken spirit steals my voice  
I have no secrets to my name  
Only the shadows hide my shame  
And so if I lift you upon my shoulder  
Inside a splintered wooden chest  
To Avalon we line the streets  
I only hope that you'll finally rest  
  
I'm not ready for this  
I'll lay you down  
Lay you down  
Don't you cry no more  
I'll lay me down  
Lay me down  
I'd gladly lay me down  
Lay me down

One, two, three, yeah!  
  
Do do do do doot doot doo do  
Do do do do doot doot doo do  
Do do do do doot doot doo do  
  
Oh yea...  
  
What does a walk in the park mean  
How 'bout a kiss when we're driving  
How much for the flutter in your heart  
What does a scent of a rose say  
'Cause if you look at it that way  
You know it's gonna make you fall apart  
  
You squeeze so tight whenever you hold me  
Know that our hearts are right where they should be  
  
Leave it at that  
Don't look for ways to complicate and analyze it  
Leave it at that  
Or this will disappear before you realize it  
I know you want to say it's love but let's just say it's close enough  
Leave at that, oh  
  
Do do do do doot doot doo do  
Do do do do doot doot doo do  
Do do do do doot doot doo do  
  
Oh no what is it about me  
That makes you think you should doubt me  
Wonder where this song might lead  
Why do you have to explain it  
'Til there is nothing remaining  
Isn't "happy" all you need  
  
Look in my eyes when we're dancing slowly  
Know that our hearts are right where they should be  
  
So leave it at that  
Don't look for ways to complicate or analyze it  
Leave it at that  
Or this will disappear before you realize it  
I know you want to say it's love but let's just say it's close enough  
Leave at that, oh  
  
Don't read my mind  
Don't search for signs  
Don't waste your time  
Just looking for words between the lines  
Baby don't you feel  
This love's so real  
By now all we have to do is  
  
Leave it at that  
Don't look for ways to complicate and analyze it  
Leave it at that  
Or this will disappear before you realize it  
I know you need to say it's love but let's just say it's close enough  
Leave at that, oh  
  
Do do do do doot doot doo do  
Do do do do doot doot doo do  
Just leave it at that  
Do do do do doot doot doo do  
Do do do do doot doot doo do  
Just leave it at that

You were amazing in ways I never knew  
It's driving me crazy but I can't get over you  
You were holding on and I was letting go  
Looking for a love I thought I could control  
All the things we said when we had a fight  
Now I realize that I was wrong and you were right  
  
But it's all right now  
I need you back somehow  
  
This is the last time baby that I let you go  
This is the last time baby that I let you go  
This is the last time baby that I let you  
  
I never held you the way I'd hold you now  
I wish I could change it, the way it all came down  
It's killing me to know I let you get away  
Holding on to all the things I didn't say  
I thought I couldn't be the way you wanted me  
But there is more to love than I could ever see  
  
But it's all right now  
I need you back somehow  
  
This is the last time baby that I let you go  
This is the last time baby that I let you go  
This is the last time baby that I let you go  
This is the last time baby that I let you go  
  
Let's turn it around  
I know that it's love that I've found  
And I promise I won't let you down  
  
This is the last time baby that I let you go  
This is the last time baby that I let you go  
This is the last time baby that I let you go  
This is the last time baby that I let you go

Merry Christmas, Saint Nick  
Well, way up north where the air gets cold  
There's a tale about Christmas  
That you've all been told  
And a real famous cat all dressed up in red  
And he spends all year workin' out on his sled  
  
He's a little Saint Nick  
Little Saint Nick  
He's a little Saint Nick  
Little Saint Nick  
  
Just a little bobsled we call it old Saint Nick  
But she'll walk a toboggan with a four-speed stick  
She's candy apple red with a ski for a wheel  
And when Santa hits the gas, man, just watch her peel  
  
He's the little Saint Nick  
Little Saint Nick  
He's the little Saint Nick  
Little Saint Nick  
  
Run, run reindeer  
Run, run reindeer  
Run, run reindeer  
Run, run reindeer  
  
He don't miss no one  
When he's haulin' through the snow at a frightening speed  
With a half a dozen deer with Rudy to lead  
He's got to wear shades 'cause the snow really flies  
And he's cruisin' every path with a little surprise  
  
He's the little Saint Nick  
Little Saint Nick  
He's the little Saint Nick  
Little Saint Nick  
  
Merry Christmas, Saint Nick  
Christmas comes this time each year  
Merry Christmas, Saint Nick  
Christmas comes this time each year  
Merry Christmas, Saint Nick  
Christmas comes this time each year  
Merry Christmas  
(Christmas comes this time each year)  
Merry christmas, yeah, little Saint Nick  
(Little Saint Nick)

You're supposed to give more than you take  
You had my heart on your plate  
You stopped loving me so fast  
There are stories left untold  
But you act like they're all old  
But then you and I we belong together again and I said  
  
Whoaooh sha nah nah  
Whoaooh sha nah nah  
Whoaooh  
I think I'm feeling lonely again  
Whoaooh sha nah nah  
Whoaooh sha nah nah  
Whoaooh  
I think I'm feeling lonely  
  
You're supposed to look into my eyes  
Forever and all time  
You stopped loving me that way  
And I never thought that I  
I would ever have to cry out  
That you and I we belong together again and I said  
  
Whoaooh sha nah nah  
Whoaooh sha nah nah  
Whoaooh  
I think I'm feeling lonely again  
Whoaooh sha nah nah  
Whoaooh sha nah nah  
Whoaooh  
I think I'm feeling lonely  
  
I feel you tossing and turning  
I know there are walls we have to climb  
I sit here waiting and yearning  
'Cause I know we can get by  
  
You're supposed to look into my eyes  
Forever and all time  
You start loving me again  
And now I know that I  
I will never have to cry out  
That you and I  
We belong together again  
  
Whoaooh sha nah nah  
Whoaooh sha nah nah  
Whoaooh  
I think I'm feeling lonely again  
  
Whoaooh sha nah nah  
Whoaooh sha nah nah  
Whoaooh  
I think I'm feeling lonely  
  
Whoaooh sha nah nah  
Whoaooh sha nah nah  
Whoaooh  
I think I'm feeling lonely  
  
Whoaooh sha nah nah  
Whoaooh sha nah nah  
Whoaooh  
I think I'm feeling lonely

Look at you, baby  
Standing in the shadows  
Wondering what I'm doing here  
Wishing something would happen  
Maybe I could disappear  
She walks in with that look in her eye  
Somehow she doesn't even have to try  
Just kick off your shoes, get on the floor  
This is what we came here for  
Oh, you've got to break it down  
You've got to get it out  
Just get on the floor  
Everybody wonders when they look at you  
Everybody wonders what you're gonna do  
You got it all wrapped up, you do  
Everybody wonders when they look at, look at you  
Look at you, baby, look at you, baby  
In the middle of the dance floor  
Lights shinin' in my face  
Twistin', shoutin' there was no doubt  
People dancing all over the place  
Out of the corner of my eye she said  
Why don't you come and give it a try?  
Get on the floor  
Just kick off your shoes  
You ain't got a thing to lose  
Oh, you've got to break it down  
It's time to get it out  
Just get on the floor  
Look at you, look at you, baby  
Look at you, look at you, baby  
Look at you, look at you, baby  
Oh, whoa, whoa, baby  
Look at you, look at you, baby  
Look at you, look at you, baby  
Look at you, look at you, baby  
Oh, whoa, whoa, baby  
I was standing in the shadows  
Wondering what I'm doing here  
Wishin' something would happen  
So that I could disappear  
She breaks the silence with a move of her hips  
You better hang on  
Don't want to lose your grip  
Kick off your shoes  
Get on the floor  
This is what we're waiting for  
Oh, you've got to break it down  
You've got to get it out  
Just get on the floor

The wind--it blows through the trees  
Claiming those innocent leaves  
And the thunder rolls these crashing seas  
Like a tender kiss holds this heart in me  
  
[Chorus]  
In this lifelong love song  
You can love right, you can love wrong  
In this love song, you can love wrong  
But if you love wrong, it doesn't mean love's gone  
  
Mary was a young girl with a young girl's heart  
And all I can remember is I loved her from the start  
I was hers forever, she was mine too  
But something's wrong 'cause now she's gone  
Tell me, what did I do?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, and it doesn't mean love's gone  
Just because you're feeling low  
And it doesn't mean love's gone  
'Cause you feel like you want to let go  
See, no one wrote in this book of love  
That we'd always know  
I wish someone would have told me before  
  
We talked about love a million times it seems  
The words come out of our lips  
Like we forget what it means  
And we said we'd be together till death do us part  
But we said those words with only half our hearts  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I wish someone would have told me  
I wish someone would have told me before

The day that I left Lucy  
A tear fell from her eye  
Now I don't have nobody  
And I was such a fool  
On the day that I left Lucy  
The day that I left Lucy  
She cried, then said goodbye  
  
Now it's done and it's over and I am all alone  
On the day that I left Lucy  
Now I don't have anymore songs to sing  
'Cause you're everything, everything to me  
I don't realize I felt this way until the day  
  
Today I'm missing Lucy  
And you say that she's okay  
I hope she is  
Now I don't have nobody and no one will ever replace  
  
My Lucy  
I love Lucy  
Lucy  
On the day that I left Lucy, my Lucy

Lulla Belle won the big show  
Got her picture framed by the window  
In the hall where lovely girls go  
Lulla Belle goes, Lulla Belle no  
  
Lulla Belle, no, no, no, no, no  
Lulla Belle, no, ooh, oh, oh, ooh  
  
Beauty queen that you are  
Put you down for a place in the stars  
Take your picture for all the world to see  
  
Lulla Belle' s leaving the ball  
No more reason to stay  
Or people to see  
Cos everyone here knows your name  
From the light on your face  
In the frame that hangs  
In the hall where lovely girls go  
Lulla Belle goes, Lulla Belle no  
  
Lulla Belle, no, no, no, no, no  
Lulla Belle, no, ooh, oh, oh, ooh

Out my window a memory  
And I'm dyin' inside  
I know the way it should be  
Even though it was right in front of me  
It was something I just couldn't see  
  
Your lonely face  
Your lonely eyes  
But this is something you can't disguise  
It's not just me, you feel it, too  
?Cause you know I belong to you  
  
Look at where we're goin'  
Tell me, what can I say  
We're tracing our footsteps  
We're going the same way  
  
Madeline  
Here we go around again  
You know it, I know it  
Don't try to pretend  
We know it could be  
So much better than it's been  
Ahh ooo  
Here we go around again  
  
I was empty inside  
But I just didn't know  
You are my ten thousand roses  
And I let you go  
Before I make the same mistake  
Hold me in your arms  
We belong, you know it in your heart  
  
Cause look where we're going  
No doubt in my mind  
Can't you see it's meant to be  
Oh oh oh my Madeline

I like to dream yes, yes, right between my sound machine  
On a cloud of sound I drift in the night  
Any place it goes is right  
Goes far, flies near, to the stars away from here  
Well, you don't know what we can find  
Why don't you come with me little girl  
On a magic carpet ride  
You don't know what we can see  
Why don't you tell your dreams to me  
Fantasy will set you free  
Close your eyes girllook inside girl  
Let the sound take you away  
Last night I held Aladdin's lamp  
And so I wished that I could stay  
Before the thing could answer me  
Well, someone came and took the lamp away  
I looked around, a lousy candle's all I found  
Well, you don't know what we can find  
Why don't you come with me little girl  
On a magic carpet ride  
Well, you don't know what we can see  
Why don't you tell your dreams to me  
Fantasy will set you free  
Close your eyes girllook inside girl  
Let the sound take you away

It started at a bus stop in the middle of nowhere  
Sitting beside me was a man with no hair  
From the look on his face and the size of his toes  
He comes from a place that nobody knows  
  
Maybe I'm hallucinating, hyperventilating  
Letting this big-toed bald man sitting here tell me about the sky  
Maybe I'm hallucinating, hyperventilating  
If you asked me now then I couldn't tell you why  
  
I've been sitting here too long by a man from Milwaukee  
He's been talking too long on his yellow walkie talkie  
He's been talking to Mars but I think he's wacky  
He says they'll come get him, come get him some day  
  
He says where he's from is called Albertane  
There they use more than ten percent of the brain  
But you couldn't tell it from they way they behave  
They run around in underwear and they never shave  
  
Or maybe I'm hallucinating, hyperventilating  
Letting this big-toed bald man sitting here tell me about the sky  
Maybe I'm hallucinating, hyperventilating  
If you asked me now then I couldn't tell you why  
  
This is Mother Bird calling Baby Bird  
Baby Bird come in, come in Baby Bird  
  
For the love of Pete come in!  
This is Baby Bird, sorry I was watching Court TV  
Do you copy? Do you copy?  
Of course we copy, twenty four hours a day, in color  
  
You wouldn't believe me if I told you the rest  
The man sitting by me who was barely dressed  
Flew off to Milwaukee or perhaps Albertane  
And left me at the bus stop just barely sane  
  
I've been sitting here too long thinkin' about Milwaukee  
I've been talking too long on my yellow walkie talkie  
I'm talking to Mars you may think I'm wacky  
I know they'll come get me, come get me someday  
I know they'll come get me and take me away  
I know they'll come get me, come get me someday  
If not tomorrow then maybe today

It must be the end of the road  
It must be the end of you and I  
And forever too  
Walking the last bridge alone  
We've given up on the good times  
And the bad we knew  
  
When I'm alone in a cold, dark room, well  
There's still someone  
That I can tell my troubles to  
  
Me, myself, and I will never be alone  
We'll find a way to get along  
And we'll be fine  
When all that's left is me, myself, and I  
Myself and I will never be alone  
We will find a way to get along  
And we'll be fine  
When all that's left is me, myself, and I  
  
When did it start getting old?  
When did it stop being worth the time  
Just to see it through?  
I don't wanna get used to "It's over"  
We've already said too much  
To make it new  
  
When I'm alone in a cold, dark room, well  
There's still someone  
That I can tell my troubles to  
  
Me, myself, and I will never be alone  
We'll find a way to get along  
And we'll be fine  
When all that's left is me, myself, and I  
Myself and I will never be alone  
We will find a way to get along  
And we'll be fine  
When all that's left is me, myself, and I  
  
Well, it's hard to see you don't belong to me  
'Cause I gave you the best part of my life  
Well, I tried to be everything that you want me to be  
But I don't have to give you reasons why  
'Cause all that's left is me, myself, and I  
  
I'm not gonna try to forget  
Maybe happiness  
Is worth the chance of a bitter end  
'Cause here at the end of the road  
I don't really care who is right  
I'll give you the last word tonight  
  
'Cause me, myself, and I will never be alone  
We'll find a way to get along  
And we'll be fine  
When all that's left is me, myself, and I  
Myself and I will never be alone  
We will find a way to get along  
And we'll be fine  
When all that's left is me, myself, and I

Oh oh oh oh oh  
Yeah  
  
You have so many relationships in this life  
Only one or two will last  
You go through all the pain and strife  
Then you turn your back and they're gone so fast  
Oh yeah  
And they're gone so fast, yeah  
Oh  
So hold on the ones who really care  
In the end they'll be the only ones there  
And when you get old and start losing your hair  
Can you tell me who will still care  
Can you tell me who will still care?  
Oh care

Keep planting to find out which one grows  
It's a secret no one knows  
It's a secret no one knows  
Oh, no one knows  
  
[Chorus]  
  
In an mmmbop they're gone  
In an mmmbop they're not there

Until you lose your hair

You say you can but you don't know

Cigars in the summertime under the sky by the light,  
I can feel you read my mind,  
I can see it in your eyes,  
Under the moon as it plays,  
Like music every line,  
There's a rug with bleeding dye under the fan in the room,  
Where the passion's burning high,  
By the chair with the leopard skin under the light,  
It's always Penny and me tonight (Sayin' Ohoh, Mmmmm),  
On the plane step up with both my feet,  
Riding in seat number 3 on a flight to nyc,  
Got my bean in a coffee cup next to my seat,  
Catch the view and another good book to read,  
Sitting at home on the friendly skies,  
Missin' her eyes,  
It's always Penny and me tonight,  
Cause Penny and me like to roll the windows down,  
Turn the radio up, and push the pedal to the ground,  
And Penny and me like to gaze at starry skies,  
Close our eyes, pretend to fly,  
It's always Penny and me tonight, (Singing Ohoh Nonono)  
Staring at a million city lights,  
But it's still Penny and I all alone beneath the sky,  
Feel the wind brushing slowly by,  
If I could soar I would try, to test these wings and fly,  
Away to where the leaves turn red,  
But no matter where I am instead,  
Singin' along to feelin' alright, (Mmmm)  
We're makin' it by in the pink moonlight,  
It's always Penny and me tonight,  
Cause Penny and me like to roll the windows down,  
Turn the radio up, push the pedal to the ground,  
And Penny and me like to gaze at starry skies,  
Close our eyes, pretend to fly, (Sing'n Ohoh)  
Close our eyes pretend to fly,  
It's always Penny and me tonight,  
Penny likes to get away,  
And drown her pain, in lemonade,  
And Penny Dreams Of Rainy Days,  
And Nights Up Late By The Fireplace  
And aimless conversations bout' the better days,  
(Mmmmmmm)  
Singin' along to feeling alright, yeah,  
We're makin' it by in the pink moonlight,  
It's always Penny and me tonight,  
Cause Penny and me like to roll the windows down,  
Turn the radio up, push the pedal to the ground,  
And Penny and me like to gaze at starry skies,  
Close our eyes pretend to fly,  
It's always Penny and me tonight, (Sing Ohoh)  
Penny and me tonight,  
Penny and me tonight,  
(Just)Penny and me tonight.(yeah)

Whoa, oh yeah  
I've seen pictures  
  
Well, I saw you just the other day  
And I could not help but look your way  
I say you've just got this special look  
That has got me completely hooked  
  
[Chorus]  
Pictures on the wall  
Pictures everywhere  
Pictures on the wall  
Everywhere I stare  
Pictures on the wall  
The ceiling and the floor  
I'm in a metal room  
And I cannot find the door  
  
Will this feeling ever go away?  
Or will this feeling stay?  
Will this feeling ever go away?  
'Cause I can't live the rest of my life this way  
  
Pictures on the wall  
(Come on)  
Pictures everywhere  
Pictures on the wall  
(Come on, come on)  
Everywhere I stare  
Pictures on the wall  
(Come on, come on)  
The ceiling and the floor  
I'm in a metal room and I cannot find the door  
  
I see your face in the clouds in the sky  
I see your face before my eyes, yeah  
I see your face everywhere  
And now I don't know what to do  
Oh, oh  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Whoa, pictures

Poison Ivy  
Whoa But everybody knows, don't ya know, don't ya know?  
She'll get you in love, OW!  
You can look but you'd better not touch  
Poison Ivy, poison ivy  
Late at night while you're sleeping  
Poison ivy comes a-creepin around  
She's pretty as a daisy  
Pretty as a daisy  
But look out man,

Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
She'll really do you in,  
Really do 'ya in  
If you let her get under your skin  
  
Whoa But everybody knows..don't ya know, don't ya know?  
She'll get you in love, OW!  
You can look but you'd better not touch  
Poison Ivy, poison ivy  
Measles make ya' mumpy,  
And mumps'll make ya' lumpy  
And chicken pox will make you jump and twitch  
A common cold will fool ya'  
And whooping coughs will cool ya'  
But Poison Ivy,  
Lord will make you itch  
You're gonna need an ocean  
Of calamine lotion,  
Oh you're gonna need it  
You'll be scratching like a hound, boy,  
You'll be itchin'  
The minute you start to mess around  
Whoa But everybody knows, don't ya know, don't ya know?  
She'll get you in love, ow!  
You can look but you'd better not touch  
Poison Ivy, poison ivy  
You're gonna need an ocean,  
Big big ocean Of calamine lotion,  
Whoa whoa

The minute you start to mess around  
Whoa But everybody knows..don't ya know, don't ya know?

(isaac hanson)  
  
Rain fallin' down outta my eyes  
And I'm wonderin' why you had to say goodbye  
And leave me baby, all alone in my life.  
  
As I think back when you were around  
And we were together, we didn't care about the weather  
'cause baby we were together.  
  
But now that you're gone, I have to say,  
The rain is falling down each and every day,  
Outta my eyes and I'm wondering why.  
  
Rain falling down outta my eyes,  
And I'm wonderin' why you had to say goodbye  
And leave me baby, all in my life.  
Rain falling down outta my eyes,  
And I'm wondering why you had to say goodbye,  
And leave me baby all alone in my life.  
  
Well, it's cold outside and it's not summer anymore  
And so I have to go inside and shut the door.  
Perhaps if you were here, the weather wouldn't seem as bad,  
But since you've been gone,  
I've been so very sad.  
  
Rain fallin' down outta my eyes, baby.  
And I'm wonderin' why  
Rain fallin' down outta my eyes, baby.  
And I'm wonderin' why.  
Rain fallin' down outta my eyes, baby.  
And I'm wonderin' why.

Saturday night and I just got paid  
I'm a fool about my money, don't try to save  
My heart says "go go, have a time"  
Saturday night and I'm feelin' fine  
  
I'm gonna rock it up  
Rip it up  
I'm gonna shake it up  
Gonna ball it up  
I'm gonna rock it  
And ball tonight  
  
Well almost 'bout ten I'll be flying high  
I'll rock on out unto the sky  
I don't care if I spend my dough  
Tonight I'm gonna be one happy soul  
  
I'm gonna rock it up  
Rip it up  
I'm gonna shake it up  
Gonna ball it up  
I'm gonna rock it  
And ball tonight  
  
Saturday night and I just got paid  
I'm a fool about my money, don't try to save  
My heart says "go go, have a time"  
Saturday night and I'm feelin' fine

Rocking around the Christmas tree  
At the Christmas party hop  
Mistletoe hung where you can see  
Every couple tries to stop  
Rocking around the Christmas tree  
Let the Christmas spirit ring  
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie  
And we'll do some caroling  
  
You will get a sentimental  
Feeling when you hear  
Voices singing let's be jolly  
Deck the halls with boughs of holly  
Rocking around the Christmas tree  
Have a happy holiday  
Everyone dancing merrily  
In the new old-fashioned way

Did somebody dare to tell you what's right  
Which colours to ware, to laugh or cry  
You want to be fair and maybe yo're right  
Let's burn our fingers stop the fight  
  
Always driving trough red lights babe  
everybody stops but me  
  
Just run away to the stars  
just run away 'til you're high enough  
I'll be waiting above  
I'll make it happen, I try so hard  
  
How lucky you are your statement in fine  
because what you think is what you'll find  
Always driving through red lights babe  
everybody stops but me  
  
Just run away to the stars  
just run away 'til you're high enough  
I'll be waiting above  
I'll make it happen, I try so hard  
Just run away to the stars  
just run away 'til you're high enough  
I'll be waiting above  
I'll make it happen, I try so hard  
  
Did somebody say it's gonna be easy  
'til you get to where you do belong  
your newly opened mind explains the reasons  
why you have to carry on  
  
Just run away to the  
Just run away to the stars  
just run away 'til you're high enough  
I'll be waiting above  
I'll make it happen, I try so hard  
Just run away to the stars  
just run away 'til you're high enough  
I'll be waiting above  
I'll make it happen, I try so hard  
  
Just run away to the stars

Loving you like I never have before  
I'm needing you just to open up the door  
If begging you might somehow turn the tides  
Then tell me to I've got to get this off my mind  
  
I never thought I'd be speaking these words  
I never thought I'd need to say  
Another day alone is more than I can take  
  
Won't you save me, 'cause saving is what I need  
I just want to be by your side  
Won't you save me, I don't want to be  
Just drifting through the sea of life  
  
Listen please, don't walk out the door  
I'm on my knees, you're all I'm living for  
  
I never thought I'd be speaking these words  
Heaven thought I'd find a way  
Another day alone is more than I can take  
  
Won't you save me, 'cause saving is what I need  
I just want to be by your side  
Won't you save me, I don't want to be  
Just drifting through the sea of life  
  
Suddenly the sky is falling  
Could it be it's too late for me  
If I never said I'm sorry, then I'm wrong, I'm wrong  
  
Then I hear my spirit calling  
Wondering if she's longing for me  
And then I know that I can't live without her  
  
Won't you save me, 'cause saving is what I need  
I just want to be by your side  
Won't you save me, I don't want to be  
Just drifting through the sea of life  
  
Won't you save me  
Won't you save me  
Won't you save me

She caught my eye with the moves she makes,  
She knew I meant to make her mine  
'cause' there'll be heat in this seduction  
I didn't read between the lines  
  
She's got time to lose your mind  
  
I know her looks are meant to kill  
That is not what she realized  
Her wits so sharp, so shrill  
She'll bang you slowly with her mind  
  
She's got time to blow your mind  
  
Chorus: She'll keep on making it rough  
Gotta get up, she can't stop  
Getting it tough, she'll keep spinning you around (round, round)  
She'll keep on making it rough  
Gotta get up, she can't stop  
Getting it tough, you'll keep banging em' down (down, down)  
  
She says the words you want to hear  
She's been rehearsing every line  
The love you need to have to lead me  
Forget your moves, she'll rob you blind  
  
She's got time to lose your mind  
  
Her body moves to gain corruption  
Her tender touch like none before  
Feel that twist so deep seduction  
To steal that halo off your door  
  
She's got time to lose your mind  
  
Chorus: She'll keep on making it rough  
Gotta get up, she can't stop  
Getting it tough, she'll keep spinning you around(round, round)  
She'll keep on making it rough  
Gotta get up, she can't stop  
Getting it tough, you'll keep banging em' down (down, down)  
  
(undestinguishable rap section)  
  
So her looks are meant to kill  
That is not what she realized  
Her wits so sharp, so shrill  
She'll bang you slowly with her mind  
  
She's got time, to blow your mind..  
  
Chorus x3

O holy night the stars are brightly shining  
This is the night of our dear savior's birth  
Long lay the world in sin and error pining  
Till he appeared and his soul felt it's worth  
  
At thrill of hope, the weary soul rejoices  
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn  
Fall on your knees  
O hear the angels' voices  
O night divine  
O night when christ was born  
  
Silent night, holy night  
All is calm, all is bright  
Round yon virgin mother and child  
Holy infant so tender and mild  
Sleep in heavenly peace  
Sleep in heavenly peace  
  
Fall on your knees  
O hear the angels' voices  
O night divine  
O night when christ was born  
  
O come o ye faithful  
Joyful and triumphant  
O come ye o come ye to bethlehem  
Come and behold him, born the king of angels  
O come let us adore him  
O come let us adore him  
O come let us adore him christ the lord.  
  
Fall on your knees  
O hear the angels' voices  
O night divine  
O night when christ was born  
Oh night divine o night o holy  
Oh holy night  
Oh holy night  
Woah  
Oh holy night  
When jesus was born  
Oh holy night  
Oh holy night  
Oh holy night  
Oh holy night  
Look at those stars in the sky  
Oh holy night  
Oh holy night  
Oh holy night  
Jesus was born tonight  
Oh holy night  
Oh holy night  
Oh holy night

Well this feeling that you're feeling  
Is something I know you've felt before  
When I see you I want to hold you  
'Til the end of time and a little bit more  
  
And I'm not gonna let it go  
You've got to let your feelings show  
  
So smile, give me all your heart and we'll never be apart  
I'll never leave you lonely  
If you'll just smile, tell me that you care  
And I'll always be there  
I'll never leave you hurting if you just smile  
  
Well this feeling I've been feeling  
Well I can feel it right now from my head to the floor  
When I see you I want to love you

If you'll just smile, tell me that you care  
And I'll always be there  
I'll never leave you hurting if you just smile  
If you'll just smile, if you'll just smile

She owns a shotgun and a fourty-four  
And a five-pound chihuahua named El Salvador  
She likes to lie under the stars at night  
And watch the sky as the plains pass by  
  
You know that skirt's so short your eyes could bleed  
Yes, she acts like she's a royal queen of modesty  
She'll keep you guessing 'cause her eyes deceive  
When you think you got it made  
She's got the aces up her sleeve  
  
She's so lovely  
And she lets you believe what you want to believe  
When she loves me  
All you know she can do no wrong  
  
You know she wants to buy a limousine  
So she can always look important everytime she's seen  
She's got a smile that you can't believe  
And the junk in her trunk! It'll bring you to your knees  
  
She's so lovely  
And she lets you believe what you want to believe  
When she loves me  
All you know she can do no wrong  
  
Oh no, she can do no wrong  
Say, you know she can do no wrong  
When she loves me  
  
When she goes out with the girls at night  
She won't be back until the dawn of the morning light  
She quit her job at the sales and loan  
Now she's working for the nation  
Got a job in immigration  
  
She's so lovely  
And she lets you believe what you want to believe  
When she loves me  
All you know she can do no wrong  
  
Oh no, she can do no wrong  
Say, you know she can do no wrong  
When she loves me

Can I hear the story about the one-legged soldier?  
Please?  
And can you tell me the story of the soldier?  
Please?  
One more time  
Or I'll knock your nose off  
  
Not so long ago in a toy room not so far away  
Lived a boy who had so many toys  
And he didn't know what to do with them all  
With them all, with them all  
Well, his favorite of all the toys  
Were the tin soldiers, the tin soldiers  
And the one that he loved the most  
Was the one with the missing leg  
  
At night the toys would come alive  
Or that's how the story is told  
And there they met the soldier  
With the missing leg  
And the ballerina with the heart of gold  
At night they would share each others dreams  
Under the stars shining bright  
But they were too shy  
To speak of love, to speak of love  
  
One day the boy sat them on the windowsill  
To watch for the enemy coming over the hill  
But when the wind it blew  
It knocked him into the street  
And the boys from the town they said  
Won't you look at the one-legged soldier?  
Let's stick him in a boat and send him far away  
'Cause we can't find a use  
For a soldier with a missing leg  
  
And he was lonely, so lonely for a friend  
And he was lonely, so lonely for a friend  
He was so lonely, yeah  
  
As he floated past a river rat  
On his homemade boat  
Well, the boat began to sink  
And he sank to the bottom of the river  
He got swallowed by a fish  
Caught by a fisherman  
Sold to the family of the boy who had the toys  
  
And the cook said, look at the one-legged soldier  
It looks just like the one we lost the other day  
Could this be the boy's tin soldier with the missing leg?  
  
But he was lonely, so lonely for a friend, oh  
And he was lonely, so lonely for a friend  
He was so lonely, yeah  
Oh yeah so lonely, oh yeah  
  
What about the ballerina?  
  
As he sat on the mantle piece to dry from the river  
The ballerina who held his heart sat at his side  
And when they got up to dance with each other  
She fell by the fire blazing bright  
When he jumped to save her from the flames  
Their bases began to melt into one and the same  
And now they share each other's destiny  
Together forever they will be  
  
And they are no longer lonely for a friend  
And they are no longer lonely for a friend  
No longer lonely, yeah  
No longer lonely  
Whoa, whoa  
Yeah, whoa  
No longer lonely, yeah  
  
Well, not so long ago in a toy room not so far away  
Lived a boy who had so many toys  
And he played with them all  
With them all, with them all  
Well, he had a ballerina and a one-legged soldier  
Stuck together at the base  
And they share each others destiny  
As they sit on top of the mantel place  
  
It's the story of the one-legged soldier  
The story of the one-legged soldier  
The story of the tin soldier  
With the missing leg

Everybody wonders and some people know  
I guess that I'm some people 'cause, baby, it shows  
When will you do it? And why will you go?  
If you've already decided, then deliver the blow  
  
[Chorus]  
The way you walk around me  
The way you talk around me  
You act so speechless  
You've got nothing to say  
The way you walk around me  
The way you're talking to me  
  
Makes me wonder if this was only play  
And I wonder, will you still love me?  
Do you still love me like you did before?  
  
Said, come on, baby, you think I'm so blind?  
I see what you're doing behind my back all the time  
I get suspicious when you call me someone else's name  
You think I don't notice that nothing's the same anymore  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And I wonder, will you still love me?  
Did you ever love me, or were you playing with me before?  
Oh, baby, you think I'm so blind  
Oh, baby, I'm not playing around this time  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And I wonder, will you still love me?  
Did you ever love me, or are you showing me the door?  
Oh, baby, you think I'm so blind  
Oh, baby, I'm not playing around this time

When we were young, stories were told  
That I would kiss you sweet like  
People said there was a connection between us  
Now that we're older stories are told  
Of how I hold you tight  
Whenever I see those people  
I tell them they were right  
Stories will be told  
From when our children are young  
Until they're old  
About our endless love  
We must have had a blessing from above  
Stories will be told until we're old  
Stories will be told until the end of time  
Stories will be told until we're old  
Stories will be told until the end of time  
Until the sun won't rise  
Oh, let me tell you mine, let me tell you mine  
It all started on 77th Street  
When we were just thirteen  
I had no cares at all  
Until I saw you in the corner of my eye  
It changed my views  
It changed my whole life

I don't feel myself today  
Just a figure in a big monopoly game  
Struggle is the price you pay  
You get just enough just to give it away  
I'm sinking, but I'm floating away  
Throw me a line so I can anchor my pain  
The fabric is about to fray  
The fabric is about to fray  
  
[Chorus]  
Maybe you could take a look at yourself lately  
Maybe you could take a look at yourself lately  
Maybe you could take a look at yourself lately  
Things keep coming and I keep wondering  
I start feeling the walls close in  
Things keep coming and I keep stumbling  
I start feeling I'm strong enough to break  
Oh, I start feeling I'm strong enough to break  
  
Been running through my mind today  
Scenarios to add to your hypocrisy  
No one ever takes the blame  
But everyone is searching for a cure to the pain  
Nothing ever seems to change  
Oh, nothing ever seems to change  
We just play like broken records in a deaf man's charade  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Carry on just a pawn and the same old song  
I'm still holding on  
The fabric is about to fray  
  
Maybe you could take a look at yourself lately  
Maybe you could take a look at yourself lately  
Things keep coming and I keep wondering  
I start feeling the walls close in  
Things keep coming and I keep stumbling  
I start feeling I'm strong enough to break  
Things keep coming and I keep wondering  
I start feeling the walls close in  
Things keep coming and I keep stumbling  
I start feeling I'm strong enough to break  
Oh, I start feeling I'm strong enough to break

It's getting near dawn,  
When lights close their tired eyes.  
I'll soon be with you my love,  
To give you my dawn surprise.  
I'll be with you darling soon,  
I'll be with you when the stars start falling.  
  
I've been waiting so long  
To be where I'm going  
In the sunshine of your love.  
  
I'm with you my love,  
The light's shining through on you.  
Yes, I'm with you my love,  
It's the morning and just we two.  
I'll stay with you darling now,  
I'll stay with you till my seas are dried up.  
  
I've been waiting so long  
To be where I'm going  
In the sunshine of your love.  
  
I've been waiting so long  
To be where I'm going  
In the sunshine of your love.  
  
I'm with you my love,  
The light's shining through on you.  
Yes, I'm with you my love,  
It's the morning and just we two.  
I'll stay with you darling now,  
I'll stay with you till my seas are dried up.  
  
I've been waiting so long  
I've been waiting so long  
I've been waiting so long  
To be where I'm going  
In the sunshine of your love.

Whoa  
I'm definitely sure  
That I'm not sure  
Whoa  
  
Sittin' on the corner of nowhere road  
Just between "I wish I could"  
And "I don't know"  
Rain is splashing up between  
Her toes  
She doesn't know her own area code  
She's the picture  
Of a heart of gold  
On the edge of depression I note  
And a picture  
Of the wrong high road  
Now it's too late for  
A fight or foe  
  
Now she's lookin' at me to know  
The faucet's runnin'  
And my car got towed  
  
I'm sure about it  
I'm definitely sure  
That I do surely doubt it  
I wish that I could say  
That I was sure about it  
I'm definitely sure  
That I'm not sure  
Whoa  
  
Did you see the man  
With the cocaine load?  
It's on sale for the price of your soul  
And a man with a long trench coat  
Wish I could hide in a big black hole  
Sell you all your pain 10-fold  
And you're calling  
Out a long, wrong road  
Fitted for the box they mold  
All you're missing is  
A heart they stole  
They're lookin' at me to know  
My heart is pumpin'  
And my feet got cold  
  
I'm sure about it  
I'm definitely sure  
That I do surely doubt it  
I wish that I could say  
That I was sure about it  
I'm definitely sure  
That I'm not sure  
Yeah  
I'm definitely sure  
That I'm not  
Yeah  
Sure  
I'm sure that I'm not  
Sure  
You know, oh yeah  
Oh yeah  
Oh huh  
  
Sittin' on the corner of nowhere road  
Just between "I wish I could"  
And "I don't know"  
There's a man with a long trench coat  
Wish I could hide in a big black hole  
  
They're lookin' at me to know  
My heart is pumpin'  
And my feet got cold  
  
I'm sure about it  
I'm definitely sure  
That I do surely doubt it  
I wish that I could say  
That I was sure about it  
I'm definitely sure  
That I'm not sure  
Yeah  
I'm definitely sure  
That I'm not sure about it  
I'm definitely sure  
That I do surely doubt it  
I wish that I could say  
That I was sure about it  
I'm definitely sure  
That I'm not sure about it  
Yeah  
I'm definitely sure  
That I'm not sure  
That I'm not  
Yeah  
You know, oh yeah  
I'm definitely sure  
That I'm not sure  
Oh yeah

I am, taking a chance  
Walking with my laces loose  
Wrapped up, taking the maze  
That everybody's running through  
I'm sick of, black tie  
Nickel and dime  
We're going through the roof  
  
I'm not a wise man  
But I see the haze  
And this is what I'm gonna do  
  
Tearing it down  
Tearing it down  
Whoo, whoo  
  
Tearing it down  
Tearing it down  
Whoo, whoo  
  
There's a fine line  
You walk everyday  
'Cause somebody told you to  
A white lie  
You can't erase  
Now you're gonna have to choose  
  
You know a blind man  
Won't show the way  
But he can tell you  
What it's coming to  
  
Tearing it down  
Tearing it down  
Whoo, whoo  
Tearing it down  
Tearing it down  
Whoo, whoo  
Tearing it down  
  
Ni ni ni ni ni ni ni ni  
Ni ni ni ni ni ni ni ni now  
Ni ni ni ni ni ni ni ni  
Ni ni ni now  
Ni ni ni ni ni ni ni ni  
Ni ni ni ni ni ni ni ni now  
  
I'm not a wise man  
But I see the haze  
And this is what I'm gonna do  
  
Tearing it down  
Tearing it down  
Tearing it down  
Whoo, whoo  
Tearing it down  
Tearing it down  
Whoo, whoo  
Tearing it down  
Tearing it down  
Whoo, whoo  
Tearing it down  
Tearing it down  
Whoo, whoo  
Tearing it down  
Tearing it down  
Whoo, whoo

Stop, na, na, na, you better save me  
Stop! Stop! Stop!  
You better save me yeah, yeah!  
  
When we played tag in grade school,  
you wanted to be it.  
You chased those boys, you testified,  
You crossed your heart, you quit.  
When we grew up you traded your promise  
For my ring. Now just like back in grade school  
You're doin' the same old thing.  
  
[Chorus]  
Stop the love you save may be your own.  
Darlin' take it slow or someday you'll be all alone,  
better stop the love you save may be your own.  
Darlin' look both ways before you cross me  
You're heading for a danger zone.  
  
I'm the one who loves you, I'm the one you need.  
Those other guys will put you down, As soon as they succeed.  
They'll ruin your reputation, they'll label you a flirt.  
The way they talk about you. They'll turn your name to dirt.  
Issac said he kissed you, underneath the apple tree.  
When Benji held your hand, you felt the electricity.  
When Alexander called you, you said he rang your chimes.  
Christopher discovered you're way ahead of your time.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on  
S is for Save me!  
T is for Take it Slow!  
O is Oh No!  
P is for Please, Please don't go!  
  
Stop the love you save may be your own.  
Someday you may be all alone.  
Stop it, save me girl. Baby you better stop  
The love you save may be your own.  
  
Darlin' take it slow or someday  
You'll be all alone. I'm the one who loves you.  
I'm the one you need. Those other guys will put you down,  
As soon as they succeed.  
  
Stop the love you save may be your own.  
Baby stop it,stop it, stop it,  
girl you're heading for a danger zone.

Well, deep in the woods  
Where nothing is seen  
A tightrope is strung to his heel  
And high on the walk  
He's down on one knee  
He waits for the slow of the breeze  
Oh, wow, look at him now on his feet  
High up in the sky  
  
And every moment extends endlessly  
It feels as though time isn't moving  
And every second, one breath not to breathe  
I watch as he moves to the beat  
  
Well, I'm on the floor  
I watch from my seat  
I watch as he sways with the trees  
And slowly he moves, but so elegantly  
I'm more on the edge of my seat  
  
On the tightrope  
Everything's bare  
All that there is is from here to there  
On the tightrope  
The goal is quite clear  
Don't lose yourself in your fear  
  
Everyone waits on the walk  
Some are long and some small  
But all of them tall  
Everyone must make a choice  
Will I go for it all and possibly fall?  
The tightrope is thin  
I could possibly win on the walk  
  
Well, high on the walk  
The tightrope it bends  
And nobody knows where it ends  
To win or to lose  
You're all on your own  
Everyone must be alone  
  
On the tightrope  
Everything's bare  
All that there is is from here to there  
On the tightrope  
The goal is quite clear  
Don't lose yourself in your fear

These walls, too hard to climb  
And that ladder is too hard to find  
I don't want to be here anymore  
  
These roads, too hard to walk  
With the things you've been saying  
I don't even want to talk  
I don't want to wind up on the floor  
I don't want to be here anymore  
  
Fair amount of disbelief  
These walls are killing me  
I don't want to be here anymore  
  
Speak your mind or speak your peace  
I swear we're sinking deep  
I don't want to wind up on the floor  
I don't want to be here anymore  
  
The sky is falling all over again  
Just another dis-conclusion  
Another disillusion  
The sky is falling all over again  
Am I losing my composure?  
Way too much exposure to compromise  
I can't take on these walls  
  
You've been yelling up into the red  
But you haven't heard a word I've said  
I don't want to be here anymore  
  
"Give it all I've got" can be bittersweet  
You think everyone's beneath your feet  
I don't want to wind up on the floor  
I don't want to be here anymore  
  
The sky is falling all over again  
Just another dis-conclusion  
Another disillusion  
The sky is falling all over again  
Am I losing my composure?  
Way too much exposure to compromise  
I can't take on these walls  
  
They're too hard to climb  
These walls  
I can't take on these walls  
I can't take on these walls

Well I gave you love, you know it  
So when did you outgrow it  
And decide that you would find another man?  
  
Well you've been out there shakin  
Tell the boys you're chansing  
When you get home, I'll be the bigger man  
  
I've been thinkin bout somethin  
I've been thinkin bout somethin other than you  
  
Well I know your reputation  
Cause you send my heart racing  
You think I would always be the fool  
  
Well I've run out of patience  
For this sticky situation  
You won't find me crying that we're through  
  
I've been thinkin bout somethin  
I've been thinkin bout somethin other you  
It's sad to say, but baby everyday  
I've been thinkin bout somethin  
I've been thinkin bout somethin other than you  
It's sad to say, hey  
  
Well if you're not too proud to beg  
I can give you some respect  
That tune you're humming is never gonna change  
  
You didn't have to do what you did  
I didn't think you'd end it like this  
Cause the love I've got it better than what you gave  
  
Well I've got girls in line  
Waiting for these arms of mine  
Listen up to what I say  
  
I've been thinkin bout somethin  
I've been thinkin bout somethin other than you  
It's sad to say, but baby everyday  
I've been thinkin bout somethin  
I've been thinkin bout somethin other than you  
  
Hey, hey, I took my best shot  
I've had enough of your tainted love you give me everyday  
I tried to limit the loney nights  
But darlin please, c'mon c'mon  
I'm not gonna make that same mistake  
  
You've been out there foolin, but I'm not thinkin bout you  
I've been getting the love that moves me, while you've been getting around  
  
You've been out there foolin, but I'm not thinkin bout you  
I've been getting the love that moves me, while you've been getting around  
  
You've been out there foolin, but I'm not thinkin bout you  
I've been getting the love that moves me, while you've been getting around

Have you ever stood outside a picket fence  
You could see through but you can't get to the inside  
You sit there and wait  
I look at you and anticipate  
  
What we could be and what we could do  
Fly the wings of an eagle  
Glide along with the wind  
No matter how high  
  
I'll be thinking of you the whole time  
Fly with wings of an eagle  
Glide along with the wind  
No matter how high  
  
I'll be thinking of you the whole time  
I'm carrying this heavy load  
I don't know what to do  
The only thing I know is that  
  
I'm in love with you Oh  
Fly the wings of an eagle  
No matter how high  
I'll be thinkin' of you  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
No matter how high  
No matter how low  
I'll be thinking of you  
No matter what I do  
No matter where I go  
I'll be thinking of you

It's getting colder in this ditch where I lie  
I'm feeling older and I'm wondering why  
I heard they told her it was tell and live or die  
I didn't know her, but I know why she lied  
I didn't know her, but I know why she died  
  
[Chorus:]  
You can't say I didn't give it  
I won't wait another minute  
We're on our way this time around  
You can't say I didn't give it  
I won't wait another minute  
We're on our way this time around  
  
And we won't go down  
  
I heard them say that dreams should stay in your head  
Well, I feel ashamed of the things that I've said  
Put on these chains and you can live a free life  
Well, I'd rather bleed just to know why I die  
  
[Chorus:]  
You can't say I didn't give it  
I won't wait another minute  
We're on our way this time around  
You can't say I didn't give it  
I won't wait another minute  
We're on our way this time around  
  
And we won't go down  
And we won't go down  
And we won't go down  
And we won't go down  
All I know is that fear has got to go  
This time around  
  
I've started feeling like I don't want to fight  
Give in to the given and put out the light  
Cannons a-blazin' shower these moonlit skies  
Then I remember and I know why he died  
Do you know why I die?  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
You can't say I didn't give it  
I won't wait another minute  
We're on our way this time around  
You can't say I didn't give it  
I won't wait another minute  
We're on our way this time around  
  
And we won't go down  
And we won't go down  
And we won't go down

I'm sorry if I made you cry  
I'm sorry if tears fell from your eyes  
I'm sorry if I hurt you  
For that was not at all what I intended to do  
But just remember  
For every tear that falls  
From your eyes  
Two tears fall from mine  
I never wanted to hurt you, baby  
I never wanted those tears to fall  
I never wanted to make you cry  
I guess I should have taken a little more time  
For every tear that you cry  
Two tears fall from mine  
For every tear that you cry  
Two tears fall from mine  
For every tear that you cry  
For every tear that you cry  
Two tears fall from mine

Waking up this morning  
Thinking this can't be real  
They say there is nothing love can't heal  
Why don't you come on down  
So you can feel what I feel?  
  
Sitting all alone in this place  
Even though we're here face to face  
There is nothing gone  
But there's something wrong  
  
Can't you see  
That I'm stuck here underneath  
And you make it hard to breathe?  
Take a look around and tell me what you see  
You'll find me underneath  
  
I know what to say  
But don't know where to begin  
I fear I'm losing you beneath my skin  
Is there resolution for this pain that I'm in?  
  
Sitting all alone in this place  
Even though we're here face to face  
There is nothing gone  
But there's something wrong  
  
Can't you see  
That I'm stuck here underneath  
And you make it hard to breathe?  
Take a look around and tell me what you see  
You'll find me underneath  
'Cause you'll find me, whoa, underneath  
  
If only you could feel what I dream  
Maybe you could hear what I mean  
There is nothing gone  
  
But there's something missing  
Can't you see  
That I'm stuck here underneath  
And you make it hard to breathe?  
Take a look around and tell me what you see  
  
You'll find me underneath  
You'll find me underneath  
Underneath, underneath

Somebody let me down  
Somebody show me love  
I wouldn't care much either way  
I'd rather the sticks and stones  
Than dragging the ball and chain  
Of what if the world won't take me?  
Even if the holes should crack  
And even if the blood flows red  
Nothing could be worse than numb  
  
So, please, use me up  
I just want anyone to use me up  
'Cause no one ever does  
Use me up  
  
I've carried it all too long  
The fear of the pain it brings  
Feeling the panic building up  
I'd rather the broken heart  
Than live in the emptiness  
Of what if the world won't save me?  
Even if the bow should break  
Even if the blood runs cold  
Nothing could be worse than numb  
  
Please, use me up  
I just want anyone to use me up  
'Cause no one ever does  
Use me up  
Use me up  
  
Treat me somewhat cruel  
You can throw me away  
As long as I feel it  
Show me something real  
You can deceive me  
I am yours to use  
Use me up  
Use me up  
Use me up

Without a doubt, girl, you're ahead of your time  
Let's go out on the town  
Give it a piece of your mind  
You've been going 'round and 'round in your head  
So don't think twice  
You'll end up worse than you've been  
  
'Cause I know that you've been thinkin' 'bout it  
And I know they think you're out of your mind  
All of this time  
I know that you've been waiting for this  
  
So come on, shout it out so everybody can hear  
There's no need to rhyme it: the message is clear  
You know I can't ignore  
So I don't know what you're waiting for  
But you're trying hard not to show it  
  
'Cause I know that you've been thinkin' 'bout it  
Well, I know they think you're out of your mind  
All of this time  
I know that you've been waiting for this  
Come on, come on  
I know that you've been waiting for this  
  
Can't figure out how we made it this far  
If you don't mind me sayin'  
There's no sense in waiting so  
Shout it out, shout it out  
Shout it out, shout it out  
You can't deny it, you can't deny it  
  
'Cause I know that you've been thinkin' 'bout it  
And I know they think you're out of your mind  
All of this time  
I know that you've been waiting so  
You can't deny  
I know that you've been waiting for this  
I know that you've been waiting for this

She wakes and takes her place in line  
And never bothers to ask why the mirror sheds no light at all  
The days turn into lesser days until there's only night  
The light it wouldn't help she's too far gone  
  
Her time is up it's five o'clock  
It never stops  
  
And she says please, and she says please  
And she says please, watch over me  
  
I watch her slowly make her way  
Down on a road she shouldn't take  
She always ends where she began  
  
The years go by, they're adding up  
She clicks her heels but she's still stuck  
She's giving in but won't give up she'll never stop  
  
And she says please, and she says please  
And she says please, watch over me  
And she says please, and she is,  
On her knees and she begs and she pleads  
  
Na na na na na na na na na  
Na na na na na na na na na  
Na na na na na na na na na  
Na na na na na na na na na  
  
She counts the time 'til her heart breaks  
Just waiting for her next mistake  
  
And I said please, and she says please  
And she says please, watch over me  
  
On her knees and she begs and she pleads she says  
Please, and she says please and she says please watch over me  
  
She counts the time 'til her heart breaks  
Just waiting for her next mistake  
Don't give up I know you've stopped believing  
And you're down and you're begging you're pleading  
Don't give up cause you're not too far gone

Candles burnin' low  
Lots of Mistletoe  
Lots of snow and ice  
Everywhere we go  
Chior singing carrols  
Right outside my door  
All these things and more  
All these things and more  
That's what christmas means to me my love  
Christmas means to me my love  
Christmas means to me my love - ohoohoohooho  
Christmas means to me my love  
Christmas means to me - my love  
I see your smilin' face  
Like I've never seen before  
Though I love you madly  
It seems I love you more  
The little cards you give me  
Will touch my heart for sure  
All these things and more  
All these things and more  
That's what Christmas means to me my love  
Christmas means to me my love  
Christmas means to me my love - ohoohoohooho  
Christmas means to me my love  
Christmas means to me - my love  
I feel like runnin' wild  
Those angels and a little child - hay hay hay  
I got you 'neath the misltetoe  
I kiss you once and then some more  
I wish you a Merry Christmas baby  
I wish you a Merry Christmas baby  
And a happy happy New Year - ooooohhhhhh  
Let's deck the halls with holly  
Singing "Silent Night"  
Fill the trees with angels hair  
Pretty pretty lights  
Go to sleep and wake up  
Just before daylight  
All these things and more  
All these things and more

Well, I just can't seem to pity  
'Cause my heart's too numb to feel  
And the smile does all the talking  
Though the pain is all that's real  
With the way that you keep screaming  
I can hardly hear to think  
And I feel the bridges burning  
Underneath my feet  
  
[Chorus]  
Where do you go, oh  
When you're gone?  
Where do you go, oh  
When you're gone?  
Oh, how the road feels so long  
But where do you go, oh  
When you're gone?  
  
I just want to stay dreaming  
No, I just don't want to wake  
Why can't we keep on sailing  
Across this emerald lake?  
My forehead is still bleeding  
From the thorns I used to wear  
And I'm left alone and beaten  
For this cross I choose to bear  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well, I finally found what I'm looking for  
Though the road's still long and the light is still far  
But I finally found what I'm looking for  
Well, I finally found what I'm looking for  
Though the road's still long and the light is still far  
But I finally found what I'm looking for  
  
Well, the voices fall like timber  
And the fear it pours like rain  
And my heart is crushed to cinders  
Underneath this kind of pain  
Well, there is no resolution  
When the revolution's dead  
So I'm left with no solution  
For the voices in my head  
  
[Chorus]

The sun has fallen  
  
Another day gone without you  
  
My heart keeps calling  
  
And I don't know just what to do  
  
When you're near me  
  
I seem to forget my lonely days  
  
It's more than a feeling  
  
It's something that can't be explained  
  
Chorus:  
  
I wish that I was there  
  
I wish that I was there  
  
When you're not here,  
  
I wish that I was there.  
  
(repeat)  
  
You were falling  
  
Now I'm coming around again  
  
I was calling  
  
Cause without you it's the end  
  
I just want to see you a little more  
  
I just want to dream of you some more  
  
I just want to see you a little more  
  
I just want to be with you some more.  
  
Chorus  
  
And you make me feel  
  
Won't you take me when you're not here  
  
It's been raining here  
  
And I just want you to be near.  
  
I just want to see you a little more.  
  
I just want to dream of you some more.  
  
I just want to see you a little more.  
  
I just want to be with you some more.  
  
Chorus

Watched from a distance, it's beautiful  
Somebody's caught in the undertow  
Have you ever felt desperation?  
The saltwater's filling your lungs  
We will regret it when we sleep  
Promises never meant to keep  
When all of the shadows need  
Is a good man to hide in the dream  
Do they know that the world's on fire?  
  
Time is a price we can't afford  
An empty glass and an open door  
You get what you paid for in sweat  
And a voice that says please don't forget  
  
Do they know that the world's on fire?  
Do they know that the time is now?  
Do they know that you gotta stand up, stand up  
Let your voice speak out  
Do they know that it's time?  
  
Caught in a maze you can't escape  
The flickering lights, and the colored lens  
The walls that we build just close in  
Until we decide to begin  
Are we distracted by the sun?  
The glittering jewels, and the beating drums  
Is it going the distance we fear?  
Have you heard that we're already here?  
  
Do they know that the world's on fire?  
Do they know that the time is now?  
Do they know that you gotta stand up, stand up  
Let your voice speak out  
Do they know that the world's on fire?  
Do they know that the time is here?  
Do they know that you gotta stand up, stand up  
Let your voice be clear  
Do they know that it's time?  
  
Some will say we've gone too far  
We're on the edge and in too deep  
Some will say we're too far gone  
You can't erase the tragedy

Dear Amy, see you in September  
Hope that you remember me next year  
Hey Jamie, you've been a great friend to me  
I hope that I'll still see you around here  
  
'Cause I'm looking through the yearbook  
Then I find that empty space  
There's a name without a picture  
But I can't forget his face  
  
[Chorus]  
Tell me, where did he go?  
I want to know  
Where did Johnny go?  
It says "picture unavailable" right here  
More than sad  
It makes me mad to know somebody knows  
There's a lying in your silence  
Tell me, where did Johnny go?  
  
Poor Katie, she won't even speak his name  
None of us will ever be the same  
It's quiet in the halls  
But I hear echoing off the walls  
The rumors of Johnny's mystery  
'Cause I'm looking through the yearbook  
Then I find that empty space  
No, he never wrote me nothing  
But I can't forget his face  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, there's a lying in your silence  
Tell me, where did Johnny go?  
Oh, there's a lying in your silence  
Tell me, where did Johnny go?  
  
Sometimes I think I hear him calling out my name  
Sometimes I wonder if maybe we're to blame  
It's been a year now and a lot of things have changed  
But I keep thinking about Johnny  
I keep turning to that page  
  
Where did he go?  
I want to know  
Where did he go?  
I want to know  
  
Oh, there's a lying in your silence  
Tell me, where did Johnny go?  
Oh, there's a lying in your silence  
Tell me, where did Johnny go?

You say you want to kill yourself  
It might make it just a little bit easier  
You think you're the only one who hurts  
Try looking just a little bit harder  
I don't know why you're holding on  
To the damage that's been done  
'Cause you've got me wrapped up in your illusion  
I keep on trying to change your conclusion  
But you've got me wrapped up in your illusion  
I keep on dying 'cause you're busy wasting life  
Don't disguise your emptiness  
By placing blame on me and everyone else  
Protected by your safety nets  
But you can't put the heart of your fears at rest  
All I feel is deep regret for what you have become  
You've got me wrapped up in your illusion  
I keep on trying to clear the confusion  
But you've got me wrapped up in your illusion  
I keep on dying 'cause you're busy wasting  
I keep on trying 'cause you're busy wasting life  
You're busy wasting life  
You're busy wasting life  
I cannot go on this way  
I bring no consolation for you and your pain  
No one else can change your fate  
You'll have to do it for yourself  
You've got me wrapped up in your illusion  
I keep on trying to clear the confusion  
But you've got me wrapped up in your illusion  
I keep on dying 'cause you're busy wasting life  
You're busy wasting life,  
You're busy wasting life, you've got me wrapped up  
You're busy wasting life, 'cause I keep on trying  
You're busy wasting life, you've got me wrapped up  
You're busy wasting life, and I keep on dying
