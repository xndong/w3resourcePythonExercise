All I say is thank you to my mother,  
To my father, my brothers and sisters  
  
To be in my dream, to be not full of sorrow  
And we call you to be in this way  
  
All I say is...  
  
Some people say to be fat is not nice,  
But I tell them to me it's perfect.  
My father only told me to be in the eye of all them,  
And not to be sad about what people say, but I'm not no no  
  
All I say is...  
  
I'm happy to be, to be on this way,  
When you not let me play  
  
All I say is....

I wish I had your pair of wings  
Had them last night in my dreams  
I was chasing butterflies  
Till the sunrise broke my eyes  
Tonight the sky has glued my eyes  
Cause what they see's an angel hive  
I've got to touch that magic sky  
And geet the angels in their hive  
Refrain  
Sometimes I wish I were an angel  
Sometimes I wish I were you  
Sometimes I wish I were an angel  
Sometimes I wish I were you  
And all the sweet honey from above  
Pour it all over me sweet love  
And while you're flying around my head  
Your honey kisses keep me fed  
I wish I had your pair of wings  
Just like last night in my dreams  
I was lost in paradise  
Wish I'd never opened my eyes  
Refrain  
Sometimes I wish I were an angel  
Sometimes I wish I were you  
Sometimes I wish I were an angel  
Sometimes I wish I were you  
But there's danger in the air  
Tryin'so hard to be unfair  
Danger's in the air  
Tryin' so hard to give us a scare  
But we're not afraid  
Refrain x 2  
Oh I wish I were you

Everybody thought this was  
  
Going to be one more freakshow  
  
Everybody thought this was going  
  
To be one more of those jokes  
  
  
  
Chorus:  
  
It's another world  
  
It's a wild world  
  
It's another world  
  
It's a wild world  
  
  
  
My generation's not going to see  
  
Year two thousand fifteen  
  
I live out at sea to save  
  
My life from the H.I.V.  
  
  
  
Chorus  
  
  
No one knows what's going on  
  
Cause the world is on fire  
  
The word is out the people are  
  
Down and we're on the run  
  
Is it justice from heaven,  
  
Or sent from hell  
  
The world is on fire babe  
  
Something is going on  
  
And I'm really scared  
  
  
  
Chorus  
  
  
Everybody thought this was  
  
Going to be one more freakshow  
  
Everybody thought this was going  
  
To be one more of those jokes  
  
  
  
Rub our face into the dirt  
  
Til the fire is over  
  
I've been to the edge and  
  
There I stood 'n' looked down  
  
Living in a world  
  
We never made  
  
But is it too late now?  
  
Something is going on  
  
And I'm really scared  
  
  
  
Chorus

Get into the fever  
Forget about the siesta  
Un dos tres  
We're gonna take off to the skiy  
Baby yeah  
Get into the fever  
Let's have a little fiesta  
Un dos tres  
We're gonna take off to the sky  
Baby yeah  
Hecho un limon a rodar  
Why a tu puerta se paro  
Why hasta los limones saben  
Que nos queremos tu why yo  
Get into the fever ...  
Por esta calle que vamos  
Tiran agua why salen rosas  
Why por eso la llamamos  
La celle de las hermosas  
Ellos eran cuatro  
Why nosotros ocho  
Que palo nos dieron ellos a nosotros  
Yo que era el mas fuerte  
Me tire al mas flojo  
Sino me le quitan ma saca los ojos  
Get into the fever ...  
A tu puerta somos cuatro  
Why los cuatro te queremos  
Saca la mano why escoje  
Why los demas nos hiremos  

-Audrey-  
  
Audrey was a girl that sat in my classroom  
She never said a word  
She just sat there furtively  
I never noticed her until I heard the radio  
Telling about the way she took her life  
Today it's all upon the covers of the papers  
About her folk at home  
I guess her daddy's a drinker  
Her mommy left her  
When she was just a little child  
Oh tell me Audrey, was it the first time  
You felt abounding ness  
  
Hold on baby  
Don't be sorry  
Every day has it's ups and downs  
Hold on baby  
There will be sunshine  
Every life has it's stormy nights  
  
Comes to think about it  
There is some things that can't be called  
About her arms  
They had blue spots on them  
I remember to think  
It starts to myself  
Is it wrong to wonder about somebody else problems  
I'm not burning with at all  
  
Hold on baby,...  
...that she lays down on the bottoms of the river  
Tell me what crime did it take  
To take this girls only willingness  
But I will pray  
That someday, she'll rise again!  
  
If you're out there  
I hope you can see my sorrow  
And pain of guilt  
I never asked you how you were  
But one thing I can assure you  
After witnessing what is been done  
I will open my heart to the new girl  
That sits next door!  
Hold on baby,...

Baby smile baby smile  
Baby laughing baby crying  
Don't cry baby baby smile  
All the babies in the world  
They laugh and play  
Why don't we all do just like them  
Baby smile baby smile baby smile  
Baby smile baby smile baby smile  
Don't cry baby baby smile

When I'm gone from here  
Will you wait for me  
When I'm far from here  
Will you pray for me  
Would you care for me  
If I needed hospitality  
Would you cry for me  
If I were lying in bed  
Lying in bed dying  
  
Would you walk for me  
If I had no feet  
Would you talk for me  
If I had no speech  
Would you see for me  
If I had no sight  
Would you hear for me  
If I could't hear  
I couldn't hear anymore  
She says  
  
Chorus:  
I will be your bride  
Be there truly by your side  
I will be your bride  
I will give my fullest heart  
  
Now that I must go  
I know you'll wait for me  
They're taking me to war  
To cease the enemy  
Heavens strength will grow  
Within you and me  
In crucial times it'll show  
If we're bond as one  
To make a big family  
  
Chorus  
  
There's no limits life is long  
There's no limits life goes on  
There's no limits life is long  
There's no boundaries  
'cause life goes on  
  
When I'm gone from here  
Will you wait for me  
When I'm far from here  
Will you pray for me  
Would you care for me  
If I needed hospitality  
Would you cry for me  
If I were lying in bed  
Lying in bed dying

There's no limits life is long  
There's no boundaries

Every time I look at your face  
I get this feeling  
Every time I look in your eyes  
It starts healing  
Every time we walk side by side

Because it's love, yes it's love  
Oh it's love

And we climb a step  
Every day it's you and I  
We climb a step

It's every time you look at my face  
You give me this feeling  
Every time you look in my eyes

Chorus 2x

They drill them to the ground,  
They take away their rights,  
They're making martyrs out of little children.  
Give a kid a gun, take away her Mum,  
They teach them how to kill when they hunger.  
Kill that man, kill that girl, kill anyone you want today.  
Blood is on the ground, they're shooting all around,  
They got an army bigger than D-day.  
  
Blood, blood, blood everywhere we go,  
Blood, blood, blood everywhere we go,  
Blood, blood, blood everywhere we go.  
  
We're living in a time where loving is so hard,  
I can't even help my little brother,  
But silence is a crime when someone needs your help,  
God have mercy on me today.  
War is money, war is power,  
Blood is the river of the century.  
Leave them now, let them go,  
Set all the children free!  
  
Blood, blood, blood everywhere we go,  
Blood, blood, blood everywhere we go,  
Blood, blood, blood everywhere we go.  
  
This song is also dedicated to all the kids living in this society  
Who are being deprived of their basis rights,  
The right to a peaceful home,  
The right to an education,  
The right to innocence,  
The right to health and food,  
To love and to be loved,  
The right to a joyful youth.  
And my heart goes out especially to my nephews  
  
Blood, blood, blood everywhere we go,  
Blood, blood, blood everywhere we go,  
Blood, blood, blood everywhere we go.

I want to break free with my heart  
With my soul with my hands  
I'll do it all with my hands  
With my there's a way  
Oh there's a way  
Oh there's a way  
Life is hardand beautiful  
That's why I wanna break free  
When it's hard I break the ice  
When it's nice it burns fire  
Oh burning fire  
Oh burning fire  
I was gone and I was dreaming  
That nobody liked me anymore  
All alone and under the water I knew  
My heart was still there  
I want to dance free till I fly  
With my soul with my hands  
I won't stop smiling for my treasure  
Family and me  
Oh burning fire ...  

Didn't wanna seduce you, but I did,  
Didn't wanna abuse you, but I did,  
Didn't wanna accuse you,  
There's a dark side of me that doesn't wanna  
Don't wanna mislead you, but I do,  
Don't wanna reject you, but I do,  
Don't wanna crush you,  
There's a dark side of me, that doesn't wanna,  
There's a dark side of me  
So break the walls with your hands,  
Don't you know that you can,  
I'll be running to you.  
Break the walls with your hands,  
Yes I know that you can,  
I'll be running to you.  
Don't wanna believe you, but I do,  
Don't wanna need you, but I do,  
Don't wanna hold you  
Cause there's a dark side of me that doesn't wanna,  
It's a monster you see  
So break the walls with your hands,  
Don't you know that you can,  
I'll be running to you.  
Break the walls with your hands,  
Yes I know that you can,  
I'll be running to you.  
So run, run, run, run, run,  
Yeah, yeah,  
Everybody dies, everybody cries  
And that's alright, that's when we all rise  
Oh, oh, oh  
So break the walls with your hands,  
Don't you know that you can,  
I'll be running to you.  
Break the walls with your hands,  
Yes I know that you can,  
I'll be running to you.  
Run, run, run, run, run,  
Oh, I'm running to you,  
Run, run, run, run, run,  
Ill be running, be running, be running,  
Ill be running, still running to you  
Cause Baby, I'm running  
I'm running

Yes I'll be here where I belong  
And I'll be here where I'm strong  
Never to go  
Never to leave you all alone  
  
The love I found I won't let go  
With space and time it will grow  
Searching the heart for treasures  
I know now that I have  
  
I'm by myself but not alone  
I have a family and a home  
I'm by myself but not alone  
I have my family and a home  
  
The road was long but I was strong  
And through the storms I carried on  
To keep on the dreams that we have had all along  
  
Yes I'll be here where I belong  
And I'll be here where I'm strong  
Never to go  
Never to leave you all alone  
  
I'm by myself but not alone...

  
  
I'm waiting for my visit  
They'll fill this room with flowers an' all  
They'll put on their biggest smile  
But only for a while  
  
If only I could help it  
If only mercy'd be on my side  
I wouldn't have to die  
And my family wouldn't cry  
  
But the pain is getting far to strong  
And the medicine won't hold for long  
It's getting closer  
So I'm waiting for someone to come  
To come and take my soul where it belongs  
But no one's coming no one  
  
So I'm calling heaven now  
I'm calling heaven now  
Calling heaven's hand  
So heaven help  
  
I try to find the aswer  
I try to find a reason why I  
I'm leaving them all behind  
But there's something I will find  
  
The blood's still running through my heart  
But my hairs are slowly falling apart  
And I just can't take it  
So I'm waiting for someone to come  
To come and take my soul where it belongs  
But no one's coming, no one  
  
So I'm calling heaven now  
I'm calling heaven now  
Calling heaven's hand  
So heaven help  
Yes I'm calling heaven...  
  
I see it in their faces  
They know I'll be leaving tonight  
But somewhere down the line  
I'm sure we'll meet again  
Somewhere down the line  
I'm sure we'll meet again

Nena Nena Nena Tereze  
[spoken]  
Yeah he, ho my name is Jimmy beep beereep beeb beeb  
Whatever you want to call me  
You know like the birds fly in the air  
That's how I want to be  
Free, free, free  
I've been trying all my life to break free  
It's like a big bad fight that never ends  
You know what I'm saying  
First I was a soldier  
Then I was a rebel  
Then a runaway, and I've been running ever since  
But it's like everything is in my way,  
Everything, even my head, my body  
[sung]  
A drop in the sea caused a flood  
Quenching man's drought  
You did it to me, to my thirsty heart  
With your tender touch  
Nena Nena Nena Tereze  
Nena Nena Nena Tereze  
[spoken]  
Yeah like a drop in the sea, that's how I feel sometimes  
Like I'm stuck in the traffic or something  
But I wasn't gonna let that be  
I made a plan  
I worked hard, I had a tv, I had a car, I had a house  
I was a man with a job, you know  
You know I had all those things  
But then I broke down one day  
And I lost it all  
I came rolling down that mountain  
[sung]  
A pencil in the hands of almighty love  
Where the ink won't dry  
Is writing the names of poor men dying  
In his angel's arms  
Nena Nena Nena Tereze  
Nena Nena Nena Tereze  
[spoken]  
Yeah I lost it all, and like magic I was free  
When no one spoke to me  
When no one cared for me  
That's the day I started singing this song  
And this is how it goes:  
[sung]  
Carry my soul, Carry my soul, Carry my soul, Carry my soul  
Carry my soul, Carry my soul, Carry my soul, Carry my soul  
Carry my soul  
Nena Nena Nena Tereze...  
[spoken]  
Yeah! That's the song of the free  
I don't want to fight no more  
I feel we where made for something big  
Just let the wind blow  
[sung]  
Nena Nena Nena Tereze...  
You did it to me  
My thirsty hearth  
[spoken]  
Yeah, just let the wind blow  
[sung]  
Nena Nena Nena Tereze...  
Blessed are the poor  
Oh Almighty Love

Cover the road, coverthe road  
Till the end of time  
Cover the road, coverthe road

It's either one  
Cover the road ...  
You might say you're ugly  
You might say you're chained  
It's inside your heart lady  
Where the battle is won  
Cover the road ...  

Sweetest angels are still crying because, my babe, the world is dying. But if
they continue crying, their wings will break- that's bad for flying.

Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling,  
From glen to glen and down the mountains side.  
The summer's gone and all the leafs are falling,  
It's you, it's you, must go and I must cry.  
But come me back, when summer's in the meadows,  
Or when the valleys hushed and white with snow.  
And I'll be there in sunshine or in shadow.  
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so.  
  
And when you come and all the flowers are dying  
If I am dead - as dead I well may be  
You'll come and find a place where I am lying  
And kneel and say an Ave there for me:  
And I shall hear though soft your tread above me.  
And all my grave shall warmer, sweeter be,  
For you will bend and tell me that you love me  
And I shall live in peace, until you come to me.

Nowadays people want more, more and so do I  
My brother told me once  
You always wnat what you don't have  
But take a look at all the things you do have  
So the reason why I wrote this song  
Was to express what I think is wrong  
I'd like to be just a little bit taller  
I'd like to be just a little bit prettier  
I'd like to be just a little bit stronger  
But hey whatever  
Chorus:  
Don't always want what you don't have  
But be grateful for what you have  
Don't always want what you don't have  
But be grateful for what you have  
Well you can call me the consumator  
'Cause I never stop  
Feeding myself with all these obstacles untill I drop  
I want a house, a fat cat, my own sauna and a pool  
Have a yacht, my own piano and finally be cool  
I'm like that kid screaming to his mama "I want that toy"  
'Cause my filled room at home no longer gives me that joy  
And I don't recommend myself as someone to employ  
'Cause I want it all  
Chorus  
I want the world just to leave me alone  
Wanna move to New York and learn the saxophone  
I wanna jam with Miles Davis and John Coltran  
I've got so many wishes I think I'm going insane  
But what the hell am I supposed to do  
'Cause I'm trying real hard to undo all the emptiness inside me  
Which is why I want so much  
Chorus

Stranger is walking through the night  
I can't be seen cause I will fright  
You got It wrong and I got It right  
Ore else we get into a fight  
  
Well I know that I'm not fair  
'Cause I wont more and I don't care  
Come and face If you dare  
Yes I know that I won't fail oh no  
'Cause  
  
(chorus:)  
Ego, I can't control my ego  
I can't control my ego  
I can't control my ego  
Ego, I can't control my ego  
I can't control my ego  
I can't control my ego  
  
Stranger is walking through the night  
You only see me in black and white  
Well no one pushes me around  
'Cause I'm yhe toughest guy in town  
  
Well I know that I'm not fair  
'Cause I wont more and I don't care  
Come and face If you dare  
Yes I know that I won't fail oh no  
  
Chorus  
  
I wanne be the best  
Don't care 'bout the rest  
I wanna have It all  
And I want It all now  
I don't have a boss  
And I don't fallow laws  
I don't give a damn  
'Cause I'm mo own man

Why tu llegada rey me hico feliz  
Why tu vida fue como un milagrito  
Why tus ojitos azules me conquistaron  
And you got your father's nose  
Your father's nose  
And you got your father's nose  
Your father's nose  
Ay guaguito de la irlanda eres bonito  
Why to boquita ya dice mi nombrecito  
Ay ay ay ay ay mama mia  
Tengo mucha hambre dame  
Mama mia dame la leche de tu pecho  
And you got...  
Ya caminas por los senderos tus pasitos  
Ya tocas las gongitas con tus manitas  
A tus canticos los pajaros  
Te responden cielito mio ya  
Ya sonries al pueblo hijo de rey  
And you got your father's nose...  

Today for the first time  
For the first time  
You took my hand  
Today for the first time  
Touched a warm heart  
What a lucky girl  
  
Cause you opened your heart  
And you gave it to me  
So don't tell me that you don't love me  
You opened your heart  
And you gave it to me  
So don't tell me that you don't need me  
  
For me for me  
you're the one you're the world  
Someone is anyone there  
My body needs warmth  
It?s a mad mad world  
Today for the first time  
I heard my heart stop  
As he flew away  
  
Open your heart  
And give it to me  
And don't tell me that you don't love me  
Open your heart  
And give it to me  
And don't tell me that you don't need me  
  
Sometimes I just fall and break  
Sometimes it just overflows  
I can't take no more  
I can't take no more no more  
  
Open your heart ?  
Tonight for the first time  
All the stars shine  
But you're the brightest one  
My love

Oh a family of bards  
A travelling went to distant lands  
A singing sweet  
With pipes and strings and an open  
Heart,just to wish their brothers  
The good life  
  
[Chorus:]  
Greensleeves was all our joy  
Greensleeves was our delight  
Greensleeves our heart of gold  
And who but our noble greensleeves  
  
In Dante's land, oh there they  
Marble strong,to see this celtic  
Bloods sincerety, a look a smile  
Even a tiny gift and turned  
Their backs though curtesely  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Then come to the citiy of a waltz  
They say: "There they'll love you, passionately"  
But in truth they were given no time and even scorned  
For the city of music  
Is gone for gold  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
So they danced their way  
Though scared and pained  
To Shiller's sweet haven  
And dearest folk and at last  
They were watched with wondering love  
And that lifted this family's saddened heart

Fell in love with a beautiful girl  
With a beautiful girl that I've never  
seen  
She told me to be strong  
Someone I loved fell behind  
I tried to hold on but I'm not strong  
Cause she told me she told me  
I'm speechless I'm out of control  
  
[Chorus]  
Hallelujah to my Mama  
Hallelujah she's in heaven  
Hallelujah to my Mama  
She's in heaven, heaven  
  
Took my pride and my job away  
I had a choice to leave or stay  
And I stayed yes I stayed now  
Took my choice and fought like a dog  
Took the chance and now I'm back  
And I made it cause she told me  
I'm speechless it's in the name of  
mom  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Won't let go too easy  
I won't let go too easy  
Cause I know  
I know now  
Cause we know  
We know now  
  
[Chorus]

  
  
Hey diddle diddle  
And the cat and the fiddle  
And the cow jumped over the moon  
A little dog lied to see such a sport  
And the dish ran away with the spoon  
  
There was a little girl  
Who had a little curl  
Right in the middle of her forehead  
When she was good she was very very good  
But when she was bad she was horrid  
  
La lala lalala ...  
  
Humpty dumpty sat on the wall  
Humpty dumpty had a great fall  
All the king's horses and all the king's men  
Couldn't put humpty together again  
  
Gerogi porgi pudding and pie  
Kissed the girls and made them cry  
When the boys came out to play  
Georgi porgi ran away  
  
La lala lalala ...  
  
Old king cole was a merry old soul  
And a merry old soul was he  
He called for his pipe  
And called for his bowl  
And called for his fiddlers three  
And every fiddler had a fiddle so fine  
And a very fine fiddle had he  
There's none so rare as can compare  
With old king cole and his fiddlers three  
  
La lala lalala ...

I wake up and see a suicide,  
Standing out in the road with no ride.  
Hold on, hold on to what's inside.  
(text missing) and the lies,  
Witnessing your loss in brother's eyes.  
Hold on, just hold on.  
There is hope,  
There is hope,  
There is hope,  
There is hope for me now.  
  
Invented my child of happiness  
I look to God to fill my emptiness.  
Hold on, just hold on.  
There is hope,  
There is hope,  
There is hope,  
There is hope for us all.  
There is hope,  
There is hope,  
There is hope,  
There is hope for us all  
Hold on,  
Hold on,  
Hold on to what's inside.

I remember a state of suicide  
Standing out a window opened wide  
Hold on hold on I heard a voice inside  
I've come back to my childhood happiness  
The grace of God has filled my emptiness  
Hold on hold on  
  
There is hope in my soul  
There is hope, there is hope for me now  
  
See my generation lost in lies  
Growing up in broken household fights  
Hold on hold on to the voice inside  
Hidden heroes don't get televised  
Daily saving their lost brothers lives  
Hold on hold on  
  
There is hope in  
Our soul  
There is hope, there is hope for us all  
  
No, no I didn't learn, no I didn't learn  
'til my hands got burned  
No we never learn, no we never learn  
Until our fingers burn  
There is hope in my soul  
There is hope, there is hope for me now  
There is hope in  
Our soul  
There is hope, there is hope, for us all  
  
Hold on hold on hold on hold on  
  
Purified hearts will feel the presence of God's eternal

All I ever wanted in my life  
Was a house on the ocean, with my will  
Something's tellin' me in my eyes  
You're not living, you're dying  
In your world  
  
Chorus  
  
Please don't die  
Try not to say goodbye  
Please don't die  
Try not to say goodbye  
Try not to make, make me cry  
  
All I ever wanted to do  
Is chop wood for my fire, for winter  
But all you ever picked up as young  
Is get a job and you'll go higher  
In your world  
  
Chorus  
  
Please don't die  
Try not to say goodbye  
Please don't die  
Try not to say goodbye  
Try not to make, make me cry  
  
All I ever had to do  
Was with living or dying, in this world  
All I ever wanted in my life  
Was a house on the ocean  
With my will  
  
Chorus  
  
Please don't die  
Try not to say goodbye  
Please don't die  
Try not to say goodbye  
Try not to make, make me cry

If I would tell you  
How much you mean to me,  
I think you wouldn't understand it  
So I wait I wait,  
Until' this day comes,  
When you will understand me  
  
But I can't help myself  
I can't stop myself  
I am going crazy  
And I can't stop myself  
I cannot control myself  
I am going crazy  
  
And I love you, I want you  
I want to talk to you,  
I want to be with you  
  
I cannot change it,  
I'm sure not making it  
One big hell of a fuss  
I cannot turn my back  
I've got to face the fact  
Life without you is hazy  
  
And I love you...  
  
Kiss me, thrill me, don't say good bye  
Hug me, love me don't say goodbye

Life without you is hazy  
  
And I love you...

Hey little pigeon where are you coming from  
You flew across the sky and know  
You're in my hometown  
Hey little pigeon here's where  
You're flying to  
Take this letter to her house  
By the riverside, riverside  
Chorus  
I feel love when I look  
I can't wait I'm really shooked  
I feel love when I look into your eyes  
You searched for my treasure  
Over the atlantic sky  
Did she get my message right  
Did she love or cry  
Hey little pigeon Oh if you only knew  
The things I'd do to fly with you  
To hear her reply, her reply  
Chorus  
When I look into your eyes  
When I look it feels so nice  
When I look into your eyes  

Woke up this morning and I put on my shoes  
Fixed up my hair and then I put on my rouge  
Hopped out my window into your brand new car  
Something's happening between You and I  
Something's going on deep down inside  
  
We're going dancing babe all through the night  
My heart is beating can't be wrong it feels right  
I know for sure that it was love at first sight  
Something's happening between you and I  
Something's going on deep down inside  
  
I wanna kiss you, but I'm afraid  
I wanna touch you, but I'm afraid  
Daddy's gonna get mad  
I don't wanna lose you  
I wanna kiss you, but I'm afraid  
I wanna touch you, but I'm afraid  
Daddy's gonna get mad  
I don't wanna lose you  
  
Last night I dreamed that we were running away  
The same old story and babe the same old game  
But I know honey this time it's not the same  
Something's happening between you and I  
Something's going on deep down inside  
  
I wanna kiss you, but I'm afraid...  
  
I guess I'm too romantic for you babe  
I guess I'm too romantic for you babe  
And I'd sail across the atlantic for you babe  
I'd sail across atlantic for you babe  
  
I wanna kiss you, but I'm afraid...

Should the sky just turn to black  
And all birds die and fall  
When the ghosts go marching down the street  
Marching through you walls  
Chorus:  
I'll be there for you  
With you, my friend  
I'll be there for you  
With you, my friend  
Hear my cry, hear my cry  
Should a flower be stoned to death  
And love is not around  
When you're hungered and you tongue is dry  
But your bread is filled with worms  
Chorus  
Hear my cry, hear my cry  
Hear my cry, hear my cry  
Should the stars decide not to shine  
And the world is cold as ice  
Whe babies only crie  
Chorus  
Here my cry, here my cry

All the animals in the world  
Who's going to rescue them  
Who says that Noah is going to  
Come around once again

And I'll never stop until I get  
Across the sea  
Mama, Mama, Mama  
Why did you have to leave  
I need you now  
Love was just a dream

All the animals in the world  
What have we done to them  
Who's going to tell our children  
Where and why they're all gone  
I'll run, I'll run, I'll run  
And I'll never stop until I get  
To be free  
Mama, Mama, Mama  
Why did you have to leave  
I need you now  
Love was just a dream  
Love was just a dream  
Stop killing, stop killing, stop killing animals  
Stop killing, stop killing, stop killing animals  
I can't take no more  
I'm drifting to the shore  
I can't take no more  
I'm knocking on your door  
I'll swim, I'll swim, I'll swim  
And I'll never stop until I get  
Across the sea  
Mama, Mama, Mama  
Why did you have to leave  
I need you now

In Santas Christmas sleigh hey  
Jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way

And frost bit cheeks and nose  
With twinkly eyes big belly laugh

To every light tonight hey

Down your chimney he glides  
His reindeer makes no sound  
He fills and light your christmas tree  
And up again he bounds

To see his magic pack  
The more he gives to every child  
The bigger the bag on his sack hey  
  
Jengle bells...

There's a part of my heart  
Wide and open for you  
The key to my heart  
It could be you  
And if you got the key to my heart  
You got to unlock the door  
And to unlock the door  
You got to find the right floor  
You can try you can try  
To get to my heart

You could do fine  
But if you happen to fly

You're breaking my heart  
Please don't cry please don't cry  
You're breaking my heart  
There's a part of my heart ...  
You can try ...

I don't want to waste all this time  
I just wanna start living for real  
I don't want to waste all my time  
Being locked up in my own little movie  
Part of me wants to stay a child  
The other is saying Angelo you better grow up quick  
For God has given you a baby boy  
And he wants you to try and be a good father  
  
Life can be so beautiful  
It depends what you make of it all  
Oh I believe that life can be so wonderful  
As long as I try to treat everyday like my last  
  
I think I'm not thanking God enough  
For all the great presents I've received in my life  
Especially for my beautiful and loving wife  
Oh Kira I think without you I would never have made it  
  
Life can be so beautiful  
It depends what you make of it all  
Having children and a wife is something wonderful  
And I'll never ever trade with something else in this world

I'm Gonna Get You  
I'm Gonna  
Buy You A Little Horse

You'll Be Brave  
You'll Be Strong One Day  
  
Chorus:  
Life Is Hard Enough Babe  
Try To See Things My Way  
Life Is Hard Enough Babe  
Can't You See It In My Face  
  
And Now I See I'm Not  
The Girl I Used To Be  
Times Have Changed  
Where's The Mercy  
And Grace  
More And More There's No  
Light Inside Of Me  
All The Pain All The Strain  
Is Killing Me  
  
Chorus:  
Life Is Hard Enough Babe

My Shoes Are Worn  
It's All Too Much  
It's All Too Long  
I Close My Eyes  
Until The Morn  
And Hope It All  
Just Goes Away  
  
Life Is Hard Enough Babe  
Try To See Things My Way  
Life Is Hard Enough Babe  
Don't't Walk

In a town far from the city  
Was a girl just a child  
She grew up to a beautiful dream  
  
And she walked like a queen  
When she walked down the street  
All the men turned around  
To see her high heels  
  
She walked like a queen  
When she walked down the street  
All the men turn around  
To see her go on  
  
Jealousy wasn't a stranger  
Everywhere she would be  
So she cried for someone to help  
  
I want to know is anybody gonna help me when I'm down  
I want to know will anybody really help me when I'm down  
  
She walks like a queen  
When she walks down the street  
All the men turn around  
To see her high heels  
She walks like a queen  
When she walks down that street  
All the men turn around  
To see her high heels  
  
I want to know is ...  
I want to know will ...  
  
She walks like ...  
  
And at last a fire was burning  
As a man held her hand  
And held her warm

Why did you have to die  
When I was only at the age of five  
So suddenly you were gone  
And I was left with answers hard to find  
Now I think of you 'cause I'm  
In hunger for your warmth  
That no one can replace  
And I know that where I go  
You're always by my side  
I just want to let you know oh... Oh...  
  
Mama, oh I miss you sometimes  
Mama, can you hear me when I cry  
Mama, oh I miss you sometimes  
Mama, can you hear me when I cry  
For you  
  
Your spirit never died  
And all your words I treasure in my heart  
You left me with a smile  
But my cheeks aren't always dry from  
All the tears  
So I think of you 'cause I'm  
In hunger for your warmth  
That no one can replace  
And I know that where I go  
You're always by my side  
I just want to let you know oh... Oh...  
  
Mama, oh I miss you sometimes  
Mama, can you hear me when I cry  
Mama, oh I miss you sometimes  
Mama, can you hear me when I cry  
For you

Tom had a job in a town outside the city  
Was working very hard  
Life was lookinvery pretty  
Nothing going wrong  
With the rockabilly Song  
That the radio was playing  
But then came around  
The Rockn Roll beggining  
Tom left the Town and got  
Into the singin  
Nothing was the same since  
He read a book  
Saying "Wheels are freedom"  
Nowadays  
Chorus:  
Rockn Roll stole my soul  
Rochindown the River like a rolling stone  
Rockn Roll stole my soul  
Rockindown the river like a rolling stone  
Tom had a band and made  
A good a livin  
Toured all the land  
His dreams had been fulfilling  
Was bringing in some cash  
But spend it all on hash  
That's when his life began to bend  
Times were looking bad  
He was lying in a clinic  
He lost all he had  
The world was looking cynic  
His innocence was gone  
But it didn't take him long  
Now hes singin  
On the street  
The song of his defeat  
Oh, yeah  
Chorus:  
Beans, Beans  
The Musical fruit  
The more you eat  
The more you toot  
The more you toot  
The better you feel  
So lets have beans for every meal  
Chorus(4x)

You say it's hard on you  
and sometimes to much to bear  
baby I understand and believe me  
I'm afraid of losing it too  
I wish I was the girl  
that sits across the room in your class  
the I would watch you  
And countevery freckle  
That's across your sweet face  
  
So many things I wanna do  
bot I can't be with you  
so many things I wanna say  
but you're too far away  
so many things I wanna do  
but the pain is too great  
so many things I wanna say  
but I guess it's too late  
  
Life ain't always  
the way you want it to be  
and that's okay  
cause something tells me hunn  
that this is the way  
I have to take  
  
So many things I wanna do  
but I can't be with you  
so many things I wanna say  
but you're too far away  
so many things I wanna do  
but the pains too great  
and so many things I wanna do  
but I guess it's too late  
  
I don't want to  
Be a burden on you  
I don't want you  
to see me like I used to be  
so let's be honest  
about the wa to proceed  
for the sak of the chanc of  
making something more beautiful  
cause sometimes baby  
friendships can last you a lifetime  
  
So many things I wanna do  
but I can't be with you  
so many things I wanna say  
but you're too far away  
so many things I wanna do  
but the pain is too great  
so many things I wanna say  
but I guess it's too late

To find in me the seed of love  
You gave to me from high above  
To rest in you and you in me  
To find the truth and not to hide  
To feel the way beneath the sun  
To hear your voice and be your song  
  
So many troubles, so many troubles  
  
Through greedy pride and noisy hide  
Through hocus pocus rock 'n' roll  
Through spinal tap and ugly fights  
And rollercoaster beauty tips  
Mm... Mm... Mm  
Through Peter Pan and pretty fans  
Through sticks and stones and broken bones  
Chicken freaks mountain and freaks  
Through ups 'n' downs 'n' ups 'n' downs  
Through ugly pimps and ugly chicks  
And ugly forms  
Through fakes... Through summer warms  
And ugly worms  
Through ugly freaks and cheaky tricks  
  
So many troubles, so many troubles  
  
Here I am, here I come  
Hold my hand one

So many troubles, so many troubles oh oh

You gave to me from high above  
To rest in you and you and me  
To feel the way beneath the sun  
Through greedy pride and noisy hide  
Through hocus pocus rock 'n' roll  
Through Peter Pan and pretty fans  
Through sticks and stones  
  
So many troubles  
Here I am, here I come  
Hold my hand one more time  
One more try  
  
Speak to me cause I don't know the way

It's cold outside  
And the moon is bright  
And I'm all alone tonight  
If I was a star  
That shined so bright  
I'd shine my love to you  
  
It's not the words you say  
Neither the way they're said  
And it's not the things you do  
That make me want to fly  
Oh baby  
  
When a star falls from heaven  
Don't ask me why  
When a star falls from heaven  
It just makes me cry  
  
When stars fall from heaven  
I don't know why  
When stars fall from heaven  
Gonna see me cry  
  
It's cold outside  
It's dar out here  
You're far and I'm alone  
The stars shine bright  
As the tears roll down  
My burning cheeks as I cry  
  
It's not the words you say  
Neither the way they're said  
And it's not the things you do  
That make me want to fly  
Oh baby  
  
When stars fall ...  
Hey hey hey hey yeah ...

Pick up yourself Joe  
Tell all the rest there is a way out  
If you want to get out

But nobody dares that's why we're stuck in the ground  
Help me out

I try to be good (oh here he goes again)  
Bu no one seems to care  
The harder I try (I told you to do what they told you)  
The more they try to break me (you damn kid)  
Welcome, wlecome to the real side of life

You spell out what you want  
And then I'll get you what you want  
I want it all and I want it now  
I'm gonna go ahead and grab it all  
Just for myself  
  
Staying alive...

Flowers and lights are taking my feet of the ground  
And I'm flying speeds completely unknown to man  
No one can help me once I'm off to dreaming time  
I've entered that world and I'm on my own  
And I feel it all right  
chorus:  
It's a strange, strange world  
That I live in  
It's a strange, strange world  
At night  
Mama Mary, what you got cooking for me this time  
I swear I saw the devil running across the room last night  
Doctors an dioxine ain't gonna medicate me, no  
Darling in your arms I'll be fine with a cup of tea

Well I, I'm a parnanoia schizophrenic being  
What about the monkey talking nonsense on tv

Entered into my life

To greet the mother of all life

The Rose  
  
Some say love, it is a river that drowns the tender reed  
Some say love, it is a razor that leaves your soul to bleed  
Some say love, it is a hunger, an endless aching need  
I say love, it is a flower, and you it's only seed  
  
It's the heart, afraid of breaking, that never learns to dance  
It's the dream, afraid of waking, that never takes the chance  
It's the one who won't be taken, who cannot seem to give  
And the soul, afraid of dyin', that never learns to live  
  
When the night has been too lonely  
And the road has been too long  
And you think that love is only for the lucky and the strong  
Just remember in the winter far beneath the bitter snows  
Lies the seed, that with the sun's love, in the spring  
Becomes The Rose

Walkin' down the streets  
You look into a dump  
You look into a dump and you say  
Why, why, why, why, why, why  
Running down the highway  
As fast as you can  
You throw a tin can and you say  
Why, why, why, why, why, why  
Tell me why tell me why  
Tell me why do you destroy  
And you try and you try  
To destroy  
I'm knocking on your door  
My knees are on the floor  
I get you on the phone and you say no  
Why why why why why why  
Tell me why...  
Walkin' down the streets  
You look into a dump  
You look into a dump and you say  
Why, why,why, why, why, why  
Medieval warrior riding on his horse  
Slices your head and you say why  
Why why why why why why  
Medieval warrior riding on his horse  
Promised you heaven  
But put you through hell  
Why why why why why why  
Tell me why...

Verse 1  
He was a wild boy  
She was a crazy girl  
Together they were  
Wild and Crazy  
They would roam the streets at night  
Together they were partners in crime  
Sleep all day  
Roam all nite  
Like two little nocturnal rodents in a forest  
Stick together 'til the very end  
  
[Chorus:]  
Wild and Crazy!  
Everybody knows their names  
Wild and Crazy!  
Lovers, Friends, Partners (Wild and Crazy!)  
Co-workers, Enemies, Comrades (Wild and Crazy!)  
Everybody knows their names  
(oooooh, ahhhhhh)  
(ahhhhh, ohhhhhh)  
  
Verse 2  
Whenever they came around  
Everyone else would leave  
But they didn't even pay 'em no heed  
Just walked on hand in hand  
If there were meadows and gardens there  
I'm sure they would have been  
Frolickin' and playin' all day long  
Mindin' their own buisness  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Bridge  
Ooh-wee! Watch 'em go!  
They look too happy  
To be true!  
Ooh-wee! Watch 'em go!  
They look too happy  
To be true!  
Ooh-wee! Watch 'em go!  
They look too happy  
To be true  
(ahah oh!)  
(ahah oh!)  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Wild and Crazy!  
Watch 'em go!  
(ahah oh!)  
(ahah oh!)  
(ahah oh!)  
Until fade

I must a walked a mile  
Until I got to the rabbit's house  
Mama rabbit cooked a soup for me  
And papa rabbit read a story out loud  
  
And then I went out to play yeah  
With my big big friend  
His name is big big Ben  
  
Winnie the pooh  
Winnie too too  
Is Winnie

He's my best best best best absolutely  
Best best friend  
His name is Winnie  
Winnie the pooh  
  
There's a tree  
Not too far from here  
With the biggest honey hive(wow)  
That you've ever seen  
  
Papa rabbit said  
I shouldn't leave  
But I can't stop my feet now  
They just walk and walk  
  
But there's just a little problem  
There's a million bee's  
But they won't get to me  
  
Winnie the pooh...

  
  
If you please  
If you want  
Won't you take me in your arms  
If you care, you really care for me  
Why haven't you taken me in your arms  
  
You belong to me  
Don't you know, how rare this is  
You belong to me  
Don't you now oh babe  
  
Are you saying that I made it all up  
I'm loosing my self-esteem  
Am I ever going to see you again  
I'm loosing my confidence  
  
You're passing by (passing by)  
You're leaving me behind (leaving me behind)  
All my dreams now up the sky  
Why not me (why not me)  
Is it her 'cause (is it her 'cause)  
Should have told me long ago  
  
You belong to me  
Don't you know how rare this is  
You belong to me  
Don't you know what it is  
  
Don't you know that you're tearing my soul  
How far do you want to go  
But I'll get up and walk on and on  
I'm a different woman now  
  
You belong to me  
Don't you know, how rare this is  
You belong to me  
Don't you now oh babe  
  
Am I ever going find you out there  
I'm loosing my confidence
