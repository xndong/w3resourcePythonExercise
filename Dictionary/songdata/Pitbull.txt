International sensation, you know  
And Mister Worldwide, dale!  
  
I'm like a quarterback, I got options  
But I played the point in school  
Broke ankles, more than a few  
Broke hearts, yeah, that too  
20 Years later, same movie, same script,  
Same player, more chips, more women, more haters  
Different toilet, same shh  
Why get caught up in the motions?  
Why go through the same emotions?  
In a sick way she love to see me mad  
It gets her wetter than the ocean  
She's a good girl gone bad  
But bad girls don't like good guys  
Now tell me if you think I'm a good guy  
That's what I thought huh let's ride  
  
All the things you do, all the things you say  
Playing with my heart so I can run away  
All the things you did,  
All the things you said to me said to me, said  
Now I'm lonely in my bed  
  
All the things you do, all the things you say  
Playing with my heart so I can run away  
All the things you did  
All the things you said to me said to me, said  
Now I'm lonely in my bed  
  
Woo!  
  
They act hard but they got soft hearts  
And I know they're soft spots  
I meet them, I greet them, I train them  
And show them all about hard knocks  
Listen, next thing you know next thing you know)  
They holding the fort down like Fort Knox (Fort Knox)  
Then they fall in love and make everything seem what is not  
Damn, these are called rules of engagement  
Welcome to the world of entertainment  
They don't want a man like Reeman  
They want a man that's stuck in the remains  
I know it's ironic, but the good girls like bad guys  
Now tell me, do you think I'm a good guy?  
That's what I thought, now let's ride  
  
Woo!  
  
All the things you do, all the things you say  
Playing with my heart so I can run away  
All the things you did  
All the things you said to me said to me, said  
Now I'm lonely in my bed  
  
All the things you do, all the things you say  
Playing with my heart so I can run away  
All the things you did  
All the things you said to me said to me, said  
Now I'm lonely in my bed  
  
Woo!  
  
All the things you do, all the things you say  
Playing with my heart so I can run away  
All the things you did  
All the things you said to me said to me, said  
Now I'm lonely in my bed

[Amanda Diva:]  
These words are written in blood, on red and white lines  
Rhymes to the beat of a war drum that cries  
Like mothers whose sons were sent to fight  
And widows whose spouses souls are all that keep them warm at night  
Underneath spacious skies where stars look more like bulletholes  
And the haze of the clouds more like shrouds  
I swear I smell gunsmoke, when I inhale too deep  
Cause cheap lies have caused the loss of priceless lives  
Bush is duckin the truth while the few and the proud dodge landmines  
Niggaz is doin time for gettin caught with a dime  
But he will never be indicted for his crimes against this nation  
Impatient with waiting it's time we fall in line  
And STOP, falling for the lies  
The war ain't only in Iraq  
It's time we fight back, for control of our minds  

(Chorus)  
Haters in the club (back up)  
Gold Diggers (back up)  
Broke niggaz (back up)  
I suggest, I suggest that you (back up)  
(Verse 1)  
I'm in the cut in the club  
Scopin the scene  
Cup half way full  
Smokin the green  
She got her hand on my nuts  
What does that mean?  
Pointed at her friend  
And she said, they'll tag team  
Now who said dreams don't come true  
Its like I'm dreamin  
When I come through  
I always find something to run through  
Speak into the mike mami  
Mic check one two  
Drunk in the club  
Off the chain  
But who gives as fuck?  
That's why I came  
So pour it up  
And get down  
Ya'll have no choice  
But to listen to Pit now  
(Chorus)  
Put your ass in reverse baby (back up)  
It don't involve money then (back up)  
Dawg, get from me and (back up)  
Everytime I fall I get right (back up)  
Haters in the club (back up)  
Gold diggers (back up)  
Broke niggaz (back up)  
I suggest, I suggest that you (back up)  
(Verse 2)  
Everybody knows  
Pit's got tight raps  
When I'm in the club  
DJs bring it back  
With no questions asked  
But the number one question is  
"Does he got cash?"  
Lil Jon's at the bar  
While me and them eastside boys smoke out  
Roll another one  
No doubt  
Get a couple hoes  
Roll out  
Beef, you don't want none  
To go down  
dumb diddy dumb dumb  
My times now  
The city I'm from  
Is covered with federals  
That'll make your crew run run  
Your crew run run  
Its next to come  
(Chorus)  
Put your ass in reverse baby (back up)  
It don't involve money then (back up)  
Dawg, get from me and (back up)  
Everytime I fall I get right (back up)  
Haters in the club (back up)  
Gold diggers (back up)  
Broke niggaz (back up)  
I suggest, I suggest that you (back up)  
(Verse 3)  
I convince mami to creep on the DL  
Even though my head spinning  
Like some sprewells  
Skip the details  
Its the vodka bottom line  
that's testin my patience like doctors  
I'm not impressed by the cool shit  
Or those chains or that ice or them cars  
All that's bullshit  
If that's what your lookin for  
Keep lookin hoe  
Cause you got the wrong one bitch  
I'll let you know  
Mami's like damn  
That Cuban's shot out  
Bitch I came to the club  
To wild out  
If you came to act up  
Then you need to get from me bitch  
And back up  
(Chorus)  
Put your ass in reverse baby (back up)  
It don't involve money then (back up)  
Dawg, get from me and (back up)  
Everytime I fall I get right (back up)  
Put your ass in reverse baby (back up)  
It don't involve money then (back up)  
Dawg, get from me and (back up)  
Everytime I fall I get right (back up)  
Haters in the club (back up)  
Gold diggers (back up)  
Broke niggaz (back up)  
I suggest, I suggest that you (back up)  
Haters in the club (back up)  
Gold diggers (back up)  
Broke niggaz (back up)  
I suggest, I suggest that you (back up)

They say he don't rap no more  
They say like LeBron he ain't got the heat no more  
They say he ain't street no more  
But like Jay say "How sick am I?" wish 'em health for sure  
But I'm cool with it, act a fool with it  
Went to one of my old neighborhoods and built a school in it  
It's crazy baby the way that the 80's made me  
I thank God every day that music saved me  
I thank my mom for all the vision she gave me  
I thank Miami for the way you raised me  
  
[Chorus: Robin Thicke (Pitbull)]  
I'm a bad man, in an evil world  
(That's right)  
And you're my type of goody two-shoes girl

Not bad for a Cuban that came from the south  
Mami let's make like tig ol' bitties and bounce  
So we can make like a baby in here now  
I'm cool with it, act a fool with it  
With my own playbook, I got no rules in it  
I like the girls that's freaky, wild, yeah, and crazy

Baby, I'm a bad man

Baby, I'm a bad man  
And I still fight every day like I ain't got nothing to lose

[Chorus:]  
So you tried, to believe in the castle made of the sand  
When it falls to the sea and your feet can't find dry land  
Reach for my hand.  
  
I sacrifice my life to give you my life through speakers,  
Try to do good even though I've been crossed like Jesus,  
God knows I got a good heart but my blood is filled with demons  
I'm fighting myself, believe me,  
I'm far from ignorant, Far from greedy  
If you know where I come from, know what I've been through  
You think there should have been another outcome  
Just like most kids, a father I did it without one  
Come from the city, X you like Malcolm, then you wonder how come  
I can move in the room full of wolves so swift so smooth,  
Thank you mom for making me a man  
Let that mother fucker knock me and my castle to the sand  
  
[Chorus:]  
So you tried to believe in the castle made of the sand  
When it falls to the sea and your feet can't find dry land  
Reach for my hand, reach for my hand.  
  
Look  
I'm from the home where the spit is the wind is the big apple  
Came down the south beach to build a new castle  
Every day I'm hustling and every day you hassle,  
Doing what you can and I'm doing what I have to,  
Throw me in the jungle and I'll show you I'm a winner,  
I'm coming out with dinner wearing the chinchilla,  
I did it for my town to show em the big picture,  
Kid Hit the switch, I promise to never switch up,  
This is for my brother two three who went to jail,  
I'm send all the picture of my shows through the mail  
He hit me with a letter, said: I knew you'd never fail,  
So put me on a beach with a bucket and a pale  
  
[Chorus:]  
So you try to believe in the castle made of the sand  
When it falls to the sea and your feet can't find dry land  
Reach for my hand, reach for my hand

Courted by the game, call us Tom Brady  
And it's not our fault that we have all the ladies

All around the globe, matter fact see your later

This is for all the women  
That have been stripped of their innocence  
(She was daddy's little girl)  
But no matter what,  
They kept their head up,  
And this is my way of saying thank you.  
(All alone in the world)  
  
Confused, and don't know what to think,  
Cause she thought that she was  
(She was daddy's little girl)  
Confused, and don't know what to think,  
Cause she thought that she was  
(She was daddy's little girl)  
To find for herself cause she thought that she was,  
(Daddy's little girl)  
(Daddy's little girl)  
She thought that she was,  
She was daddy's little girl  
(Daddy's little girl)  
She was daddy's little girl  
  
I was raised by women,  
A women made me a man,  
It's just to bad that a man,  
Took her innocence.  
And god knows that I,  
I would finish him,  
Diminish him,  
End up killing him.  
Blame it on the ignorance,  
That's where her childhood went,  
New country,  
New language,  
That's how seven years were spent.  
Time you can't buy it,  
And someone, they don't hear  
I know that we bumped heads,  
Just know mum that I'm here.  
  
Cuba peter pan,  
The revelation was great,  
I wanna thank you mum,  
For the way you raised me,  
All your life you wanted  
Only one thing,  
And that was to say  
(She was daddy's little girl)  
  
Confused, and don't know what to think,  
Cause she thought that she was  
(She was daddy's little girl)  
Confused, and don't know what to think,  
Cause she thought that she was  
(She was daddy's little girl)  
To find for herself cause she thought that she was,  
(Daddy's little girl)  
(Daddy's little girl)  
  
She thought that she was,  
She was daddy's little girl  
(Daddy's little girl)  
She was daddy's little girl  
  
Took care of me,  
Just like a mother,  
Till you got pregnant,  
Then you was off to Georgia,  
It was tough how we,  
How we were brought up,  
Tougher for you,  
Cause you had no father,  
Now I understand,  
Now that I'm a man,  
How much a woman needs,  
Someone to call dad,  
You cut through the pain,  
You walked through the rain,  
The game ain't playin' you,  
Baby you play the game.  
Now your in search of,  
That father figure,  
And if you find him,  
He denies you,  
Jenny fuck that niggaare,  
Come as a bitch,  
Even though I know she wish  
  
(She was daddy's little girl)  
  
Confused, and don't know what to think,  
Cause she thought that she was  
(She was daddy's little girl)  
Confused, and don't know what to think,  
Cause she thought that she was  
(She was daddy's little girl)  
To find for herself cause she thought that she was,  
(Daddy's little girl)  
(Daddy's little girl)  
She thought that she was,  
She was daddy's little girl  
(Daddy's little girl)  
She was daddy's little girl  
  
This is for all the women that stayed strong,  
And beat all the odds  
(She was daddy's little girl)  
The ones that have been raped,  
The ones that grew up fatherless  
(All alone in the world)  
Ooooohooo  
But still found a way to raise their kids,  
To do the right thing  
(She was daddy's little girl)  
This is for y'all,

Or you can teach me like a thing or two

If Pit's on the job, then there's no need to worry  
Dog just hurry up and wait  
'cause I ain't Going no where anytime soon  
Sick what these rappers want to be?  
That's me, times 2  
Now...  
Get ready for me to take over this game  
I'm cutting the flow, like I'm cutting the cane  
Things will never be the same  
Pause...  
There's a lick for 50 bricks  
Now pause...  
And think about it  
Then pause...  
Is it really worth it?  
Then pause... pause...  
FUCK YEAH!!!

Get the mask, get the gloves

y'all want me to stop?! Hurry up and wait!  
y'all want me shot?! Hurry up and wait!  
y'all hurry up and wait! y'all hurry up and wait!  
I've been brought up  
By street cats who didn't get caught up  
Like that New Jack Nino Brown at the Carter  
I'm the new Tony Montana, only I'm just a  
Little bit smarter!

Yea niggas, Welcome to Dade County  
Where we slang rocks that claim blocks  
And those red and blue lights just keep our streets hot  
  
C'mon and ride with a nigga  
so I can show you what Dade County really got  
See don't be fooled by South Beach  
Thinking when you come to the Bottom  
You can just run these streets  
You and your jewels are like a menu  
And trust me nigga we intend to eat  
  
Fuck around and cross that I-Three Ninety Five  
You just run into a bunch of dead end streets  
Niggas with wife-beaters and bare feet  
That's right, I'm talking straight goon style  
Go beyond that about three miles  
and you're now entering the infamous Lil Havana  
Now I know yall studio gangsters be vibing off the movie Scarface  
But the wrong move in this place,  
you'll fuck around and meet the real Tony Montana  
  
So fuck them palm trees  
I got shit for you to really see  
Like there's a graveyard with bury sub  
With niggas buried four generations deep  
And I aint even talking about sister lined next to brother  
I'm talking granddaddy to grandmother piled up on top of each other  
And all that rap about your Lil Haiti connections?  
Nigga you don't even know a real zoo  
But I can introduce you to one that'll kick in your door  
Put you faced down on the floor  
And have your whole family wiring money from Chicago  
  
But you a star, though  
Okay, nigga if you a real G  
This is where you tell your car to go  
  
Opa Locka  
Where there is continuous spotlight  
helicopters and a triangle full of choppers  
Carol City will make holes in you so big,  
They can't be plugged by doctors  
  
Nigga, this is the real Dade County  
Where we are soldiers from birth to the hearse  
That's why my childhood consisted of a bulletproof vest and a Pyrex  
Nigga, you haven't even seen the real Miami, yet  
So Welcome to Miami Dade County, the real Miami  
Where we live and die, for life

Chorus:  
When you need it call me on the phone tonight  
It's on, it's on, it's on  
Body's callin vibrate in reggaeton  
It's on, it's on  
  
... like a drive...  
In my life's real got no... by  
You can ask anybody that sweep me  
How that little chick on right years ago...  
You tricked you stop but then little chick... on pitbull  
He was a... picking up rappers like know us off  
Two at a time nigga  
Who would have thought  
... on the rappers not to take it the...  
If you can't finish don't start hey  
If you can't finish don't start hey  
If you can't finish don't start hey  
  
[Chorus:]

[50 Cent]  
Yeah nigga! Ha ha  
Let's go nigga, this is what it is  
Tupac cut his head bald  
Then you wanna cut yo' head bald (You pussy nigga!)  
Tupac wear a bandana  
You wan' wear a bandana  
Tupac put a cross on his back  
You wanna put 2 crosses on yo' back  
Nigga you ain't Tupac... This is Tupac!  
  
[Verse One: 2Pac]  
They say more money and women are funny,  
But in this tragic endings I can make a million and still not  
Get enough for spendin'  
And since my life is based on sinnin', I'm hell-bound  
I'd rather be buried than be worried diffrent than be held down  
My game plans to be trained well  
Military mind of a thug lord sittin' in a cemetary car  
I've been lost since my adolescent callin from Jesus  
Ballin' as a gangsta wonderin' if you see this  
Young black male crack sales got me three strikes  
Livin in jail, this is hell, enemies die,  
Wonder when we all pass, is anybody listenin?  
Got my hands on my semi-shotgun, everybody's snitchin'  
Please God can you understand me, bless my family  
Guide us all before we fall into insanity  
I'm makin' a point for all my people to be warlike  
Buy some shit to have you stupid bitches all tight  
  
[Chorus:]  
Go niggas wanna get on that's right  
I gots some niggas in my click that make they muthafuckin' jaws tight now  
  
Go niggas wanna get on that's right  
I gots some niggas in my click that make they muthafuckin' jaws tight now  
  
[Pitbull]  
I'm doing the impossible  
I gotta big flow that's unbelievable,  
I'm achieving the unachievable  
I'm taking over like coke and baking soda  
The streets are waiting for me  
But for those who don't know me don't hate on me come on homie  
  
Ya'll should know me better  
Don't be mad cause I'm a go getter from the bottom to ny to la  
Cubans and Essays and old school Chevys  
Blacks and Hispanics getting money I know yall can't stand it  
That's why I say fuck 'em that just gives me more reason to buck 'em  
If you're felling lucky, then dog, press your luck  
And watch how quickly you get stuck I'll make sure when they hold you down  
You wont get up, Dade County bet that up.  
  
For building me the way I've been built to the day I get killed  
I'ma get money and run through bitches like Wilt the Stilt  
Chamberlain empty the chamber in in your face  
And leave your brains outa place  
That's what happens to slow niggas that think they can live life at a fast
pace

Be careful with them keys  
Don't hesitate to squeez watch out from them feds  
'Cause they hate ya'll  
Bank accounts over seas when them Feds come for me all they gonna find is cds
and tapes, dog

go to waste, dog.  
  
[50 Cent]  
Now since you're cryin for mercy I promise  
My success'll be the death of you  
Lo and behold you sold your soul  
Nigga there's nuttin left of you  
Look in the mirror, ask yourself who are you?  
If you don't know who you are, how could your dreams come true?  
Motherfucker, I sat back and watched  
You pretended to be 'Pac, you pretended to be hot  
But you're not now!  
I see it so clear  
You can't take the pressure, you pussy  
I warned you not to push me  
You see me and chills run up your spine  
Hardly even in the same war, but your heart ain't like mine  
Press, they look at me like I'm a menace  
I was playin with guns  
While your momma had your punk ass playin tennis  
  
[Chorus:]

Hello, my name is not Mr. Right but you can be my missis tonight  
I know we're only fooling around, I'm never gonna be your Mr. Right

And if you put me on baby I'll break you off, this is the third mundo, take

Baby your all that I want  
When your lying here in my arms

And loving is all that I need  
And it found it there in your heart  
It isn't too hard to see  
Were in heaven

Shes there thick n thin  
Shes there rain or fall  
Shes there whether I lose or win whether I rise or fall  
Shes with me wherever we live, ravisly on poverty  
She loves me for me

Hold fire that's right,  
This life can be deceitful  
In my career attracts,  
All the wrong people

Then you better keep her  
I always put her first,  
Her love is heaven on earth

Baby your all that I want  
When your lying here in my arms

Takin' me so high, up, up, up  
A place that I've never been, aah  
Party, party all night, night, night  
Sleep all day then do it again, 'gain  
  
We run yes the we run the night, ni-night, night,  
Run 'em like run 'em run 'em woop  
We run yes the we run the night, we-we-we run, we-we-we run, run  
We run yes the we run the night, the night, ni-ni-ni-ni  
Run 'em like run 'em run 'em woop

Or end up in the hospital  
Getting emergency operations  
Family asking doctor doctor  
Will he make it through

When the chi-chi-chi-choppers  
Are chi-chi-chi-chopping at you

Your finished, your through  
There's no coming back

Its hard to understand  
But Pitbull will serve you anyway  
Even underhand  
Don't fuck around  
Because you just might end up  
Under land
