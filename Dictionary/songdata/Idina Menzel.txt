Where do you go?  
When you're alone and in your head  
Why do they know you?  
Is your story painted in red?  
What do you see?  
What do you dream when you're awake?  
What have they seen of you?  
Are you afraid of what's been said?  
  
And if time stood still  
If you won't be your witness  
No one ever will  
  
I hear a voice that's in my head  
Don't let me down  
'Cause I can't hold the future in my head  
So many things I should have said  
Don't let me down  
'Cause I would be a lucky girl if time stood on it's head  
Don't let me down  
  
Don't let me down  
Don't let them see  
These shadows fallen over me  
Where do you go?  
When you're awake and in your head?  
Why do they know you?  
Is your story painted in red?  
  
And if time stood still  
If I can't be my teacher  
No one ever will  
  
I hear a voice that's in my head  
Don't let me down  
'Cause I can't hold the future in my head  
So many things I should have said  
That let me let me down  
  
And I can't choose the road ahead  
Close my eyes and hold my breath  
Hope my little debt won't let me down  
And I can't choose the road ahead  
And close my eyes and hold my breath  
Hope my little death won't let me down  
  
And if time stood still  
If I can't be my teacher  
No one ever will  
  
I hear a voice that's in my head  
Don't let me down  
'Cause I can't hold the future in my head  
So many things I should have said  
That let me let me down  
  
I hear a voice that's in my head  
Don't let me down  
'Cause I can't hold the future in my head  
So many things I should have said  
That let me let me down  
  
'Cause I would be a lucky girl if time stood on it's head  
Don't let me down

In the roses  
In the spring  
I remember  
There was a time  
I wasn't afraid of anything  
But with the lilacs  
And the rain  
One day you went away  
I remember  
I forgot everything  
[Chorus:]  
My mother's always trying to tell me  
How to be grateful how to believe  
My father's always trying to say  
Baby you're beautiful in every way  
My lover's always got me in his arms  
Trying to protect me keep me from harm  
So why do I always have to be  
My worst my own worst enemy  
In the shadows in the grays  
In the lonely  
There is a place  
Where we can all hide away  
But in the windows of the soul  
There is nowhere we can go  
If we keep running  
Running from our destiny  
[Chorus:]  
My mother's always trying to tell me  
How to be grateful how to believe  
My father's always trying to say  
Baby you're beautiful in every way  
My lover's always got me in his arms  
Trying to protect me keep me from harm  
So why do I always have to be  
My worst my own worst enemy  
You say I walk on water  
You say I walk on the moon  
But it's never enough  
(no it's never enough no it's never enough)  
You say I'm only human  
It's all in my head  
But it's never enough  
(no it's never enough no it's never enough)  
One day I'll find  
My alibi...  
[Chorus:]  
My mother's always trying to tell me  
How to be grateful how to believe  
My father's always trying to say  
Baby you're beautiful in every way  
My lover's always got me in his arms  
Trying to protect me keep me from harm  
So why do I always have to be  
My worst my own worst enemy

If I told you that I lie sometimes,  
If I told you that I'd run away,  
If I told you who I was before,  
Would you follow me?  
  
If I told you that I sneak sometimes,  
If I told you that I love too much,  
If I showed you the other side,  
Would you follow me?  
  
Cause I'm shedding my skin  
So you can see my face,  
I need you to know who I am.  
I'm ready to go where I've never been,  
Will you stay around and follow me?  
  
Yeah  
If I told you the earth was square,  
If I told you water wasn't wet,  
If I told you life was fair,  
Would you follow me?  
  
Oh  
Cause I'm shedding my skin  
So you can see my face,  
I need you to know who I am.  
I'm ready to go where I've never been,  
Will you stay around and follow me?  
  
To the furthest moon and back,  
Jupiter and Mars and all that,  
To the middle of a galaxy,  
On the smallest raft  
I don't know if I can be sure  
Of anything I believed before  
Will you follow me?  
  
Cause I'm shedding my skin  
So you can see my face,  
I need you to know who I am.  
I'm ready to go where I've never been,  
Will you stay around and follow me?  
  
To the moon and back,  
Jupiter and Mars and all that

Hands touch, eyes meet  
Sudden silence, sudden heat  
Hearts leap in a giddy whirl  
He could be that boy  
  
But I'm not that girl  
Don't dream too far  
Don't lose sight of who you are  
Don't remember that rush of joy  
He could be that boy  
I'm not that girl  
  
Every so often we long to steal  
To the land of what-might-have-been  
But that doesn't soften the ache we feel  
When reality sets back in  
  
Blithe smile, lithe limb  
She who's winsome, she wins him  
Gold hair with a gentle curl  
That's the girl he chose  
And heaven knows  
I'm not that girl  
  
Don't wish don't start  
Wishing only wounds the heart  
I wasn't born for the rose and pearl  
There's a girl I know  
He loves her so  
I'm not that girl

Down in Larissa's lagoon  
She sits by the light of the moon  
She's hearing voices in her head  
She must be strong  
She must not give in to their song  
She's hearing voices in her head  
  
Down in Larissa's lagoon  
Her guests, they sleep in separate rooms  
But her father comes to tuck her into bed  
She's lost her mind  
Got no control  
And there's nowhere else to go  
When her father comes to tuck her into bed  
  
[Chrous:]  
But Larissa woke up one morning singing,  
"Hallelujah, remember me for my passion,  
The paradise that I imagined, hallelujah."  
  
Down in Larissa's lagoon  
The skies, they never look blue  
'Cause someone spiked the rain  
With a little extra juice  
She thinks she's being followed  
Any minute she'll be swallowed  
Someone spiked this rain  
With a little extra juice  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hallelujah... Hallelujah... Hallelujah... Hallelujah  
Down in Larissa's lagoon  
There is no force that's greater  
Looming deep within a very, very, very troubled girl  
She stays awake for hours  
Picking out the sweetest flowers  
To lay upon the grave of a very, very troubled girl  
  
[Chorus]

The snow glows white on the mountain tonight  
Not a footprint to be seen  
A kingdom of isolation  
And it looks like I'm the queen  
  
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside  
Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I've tried  
Don't let them in, don't let them see  
Be the good girl you always have to be  
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know  
Well, now they know  
  
Let it go, let it go  
Can't hold it back anymore  
Let it go, let it go  
Turn away and slam the door  
I don't care what they're going to say  
Let the storm rage on  
The cold never bothered me anyway  
  
It's funny how some distance makes everything seem small  
And the fears that once controlled me can't get to me at all  
It's time to see what I can do  
To test the limits and break through  
No right, no wrong, no rules for me  
I'm free  
  
Let it go, let it go  
I am one with the wind and sky  
Let it go, let it go  
You'll never see me cry  
Here I stand and here I stay  
Let the storm rage on  
  
My power flurries through the air into the ground  
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around  
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast  
I'm never going back, the past is in the past  
  
Let it go, let it go and  
I'll rise like the break of dawn  
Let it go, let it go  
That perfect girl is gone  
Here I stand in the light of day  
Let the storm rage on  
The cold never bothered me anyway

It's October again  
Leaves are falling down like rain  
One more year's come and gone  
But nothing's changed  
Wasn't I supposed to be someone  
Who could face the things that I've been running from?  
  
Let me feel  
I don't care if I break down  
Let me fall  
Even if I hit the ground  
If I cry a little  
And die a little  
At least I know I lived  
Just a little  
Let me feel  
Let me fall  
  
I become much too good at being invincible  
I'm an expert at 'play it safe' and 'keep it cool'  
But I swear this is not who I'm meant to be  
I refuse to let my life fall over me  
  
Let me feel (let me feel)  
I don't care if I break down  
Let me fall (let me fall)  
Even if I hit the ground  
If I cry a little (cry)  
And die a little (die)  
At least I know I lived  
Just a little  
Let me feel  
Let me fall  
  
Yes, I'm gonna be someone (gonna be)  
If I take it as it comes  
If I face the things that I've been running from  
I've been running from  
  
Let me feel (let me feel)  
I don't care if I break down  
Let me fall (let me fall)  
Even if I hit the ground  
If I cry a little (cry)  
And die a little (die)  
At least I know I lived  
Just a little  
Let me feel  
Let me fall  
  
It's October again  
The leaves are falling down like rain  
Oh...

Don't know much about practicing what I preach,  
Don't know how to be envious without jealousy,  
Don't know how to hold my temper, when I have to get in the last word,  
Don't know how to speak softly and still be heard,  
But before I lose everything and everyone who loves me...  
God if you're listening would you have a message sent?  
Cause I need to be a better lover, brother, and a friend.  
God if you're listening would you come up with some change?  
Cause I wake up every morning with a penny to my name.  
Don't know much about love cause I get the same crap from every guy,  
Don't know how to see the grass being greener on my side,  
Don't know much about wisdom without being jaded,  
Don't know how to take criticism without feeling hated,  
But before I lose everything and everyone who loves me...  
God if you're listening would you have a message sent?  
Cause I need to be a better lover, brother, and a friend.  
God if you're listening would you come up with some change?  
Cause I wake up every morning with a penny to my name.  
Whoa man, I'm everything I said I wouldn't be,  
Standing here with nothing, will you help me?  
Don't know how to tell a joke without putting my foot in my mouth,  
Don't know how to be intimate if I don't have a crowd,  
Don't know how to be hopeful, what if they let me down?  
I don't know how to keep myself from hurting everyone...  
God if you're listening would you have a message sent?  
Cause I need to be a better lover, brother, and a friend.  
God if you're listening would you come up with some change?  
Cause I wake up every morning with a penny to my name.  
God if you're listening would you have a message sent?  
Cause I need to be a better lover, brother, and a friend.  
God if you're listening would you come up with some change?  
Cause I wake up every morning with a penny to my name.  
Oh, God, I don't know much about nothing.  
No, so give me a break.  
Anyway, won't anybody listen to me?  
Oh, oh.  

A crack in the smile  
But she's always in style while she waits  
Waving goodbye but she's too tired to cry and she's wasted  
A letter he wrote  
But it's far too expose so he throws it away  
The sound of regret as it's counting the steps back to safe  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't want to leave you with perfume and promises  
But we'll never know 'till we capture and bottle it  
'Cause wouldn't it be such a shame  
If all was wasted  
  
Not an inch of the room  
That isn't in bloom or in light  
So we drink 'till its dawn  
Every drip 'till it's gone and we're wasted  
It's a thing of the truth  
But we'll lie and we'll look for the perfect escape  
And the moment will go like melted snow in the rain  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Stay for another morning  
Study the curves on my face  
Stay even when we're unknowing  
Stay 'till they tear you away  
  
[Chorus]

Well I don't believe in god  
But she talks to me all the time  
And I banish my mother  
But she holds me when I cry  
And I have been unfaithful for  
With me he'll spend the rest of his life  
  
Yet I have been forgiven  
By all whom I've betrayed and loved  
And I have everything I want  
Is it ever enough?  
  
Chorus: Still I can't be still  
Still I can't be silent  
Still I can't be still  
Still I can't be saved  
Still I can't be still  
I can't be silent  
Still I  
Still  
  
Well I don't believe I'm beautiful but  
At least I have my sister's smile  
And I resist the muses but  
They sing to me in exile  
And destiny is not deafening  
But it hushed me like a child  
And every time I feel as though  
I'm closer to the eye  
The storm winds blow  
I run inside, and though I feel revived-  
  
Chorus  
  
The insatiable peace  
Of my quest for, for true serenity  
No matter how hard the rain  
The thirst, the thirst is never ending  
No matter how many friends  
For angels been sent down to take me away  
They can't make it okay  
  
And every time I feel as though I'm  
Closer to the eye  
The storm winds blow  
I run inside, and though I feel revived  
Yes every time I feel as though I'm  
Closer to the eye  
The storm winds blow  
I run inside, and though I feel revived  
I don't believe I'm beautiful  
But least I've got my sister's smile  
And I resist the muses but  
They sing to me  
Still  
Destiny is deafening

Where do I begin my love?  
Starting with the things I haven't said enough of  
Starting with the day you changed my life and ending with the way I feel
tonight  
Where do I begin?  
  
Where do I belong if you're not here?  
This is way beyond my darkest fear  
Don't know where I am or where I start  
The trail in between is way too far  
Where do I begin?  
  
I've always counted all my blessings  
Knowing you'll defend me, stand by my side  
I always turn and lose my sense's each time I intended words to come out right  
Where do I begin my love?  
  
Maybe with the morning you brought me the sun  
Maybe with the stars from out of space  
You took a few and lit up my face  
Where do I begin?  
  
I've always counted all my blessings  
Knowing you'll defend me, stand by my side  
I always turn and lose my senses each time I intended for these words would
come out right  
  
Where do I begin my love?  
I always read the last page instead of the first one  
There's no need to rush it all in  
I love you and I'll say it again  
Where do I begin?  
Where do we begin?
