[Intro]  
Rrrr Ting  
  
[Verse]  
I'll admit it, I'll admit it  
Watch your motherfuckin' tone boy  
Get hurt boy  
Aww here go another mo'fucker that don't understand the concept of puttin'
money first boy (first)  
I'm 'bout to hit you with the work boy (work)  
I'm 'bout to hit you with the work boy (work)  
I hate comin' through stuntin' on niggas that I know, ahh that's the worst boy
(worst)  
I'll admit it, I'll admit it  
You haven't been a man for like a minute  
I told you that I'm in it for the long haul  
You can really get the business  
I'll admit it, I'll admit it  
Rolling swishers hittin' swishes  
Got me feelin' like a ball hog  
I don't pass 'em when I get it  
I'll admit it, I'll admit it  
You too worried 'bout the bitches  
I got one girl, and she my girl, and nobody else can hit it  
She'll admit it, she'll admit it  
She ain't fuckin' with you niggas  
And just like every single other thing in my life  
You can have her when I'm finished  
I hear the talk on road is I'm the shit boy  
Phone call back home, shit is hot up in the 6 boy  
Shit hot up in the 6 right now shit hot up in the 6 boy  
Shit is hot up in the 6 right now  
Come see us and get it fixed boy  
Black Benz on the road boy  
Already had a Rolls Royce  
Sold a couple Bentley last week, them were my old toys  
I give a fuck about old boy  
I give a fuck about his squad boy  
I give a fuck about your mob boy  
I'm the real 6 God boy  
I'm about to say a true thing  
I'm about to say a true thing  
You was poppin' back when Usher wore a U-chain  
God damn you changed  
I put it on 'erything, it's a Rrr Ting  
It's a OVO come through murk things  
I know you heard things  
Bitch I know you heard things  
Yeah, I know you heard things  
I'm not new to this  
Coming from the motherfucking 6 side  
I'm not new to this  
Niggas wouldn't make it on this side  
I'm not new to this  
I'm not new, I'm not new  
Yeah, I know you heard things  
Nobody really likes us except for us  
Yeah, all I ever needed was the squad so that's what's up  
Yeah, my sound got the whole city in your way right now  
So I don't give a fuck about what anybody sayin' right now

[Intro]  
Yeah, for the dogs dem, you know  
Man when shit gets like this, in the whole city  
Shit's crazy right now, this shit ain't gonna stop  
You know shit gonna get a lot more worse before it get any better  
  
[Verse 1]  
Look  
Momma hit my phone and said rap's no good  
Better than her telling me the check's no good  
Now they wanna act like I do no good  
Funny cause I really did more than I should  
I made a decision last night that I would die for it  
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it  
Can't get me on the line so they hang me out to dry for it  
You know 40 wants peace, but I'm down to cut ties for it  
And I can't sleep these days unless I take one  
If they don't have a story these days, they'll make one  
Life is always on, man, I never get a break from it  
Doesn't matter where I go, I can never get away from it  
They give me loyalty and I don't gotta pay for it  
Same way, breads gotta break for it  
Keeping people fed is my only peace of mind now  
And I turn the six upside down, it's a nine now  
I made a decision last night that I would die for it  
  
[Hook]  
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)  
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)  
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)  
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)  
  
[Verse 2]  
All these hand outs, man it's getting outta hand  
I'mma start telling niggas "Get it how you can"  
I got it right now so I'm everybody's friend  
If I ever lose I bet we never speak again  
I made a decision last night that I'd die for it  
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it  
First place, first place, man we can't be tied for it  
I only drove it five times, paid 1.5 for it  
Keychain go jang-a-lang, I wanna do major things  
MJ in every way, I just don't fade away  
Six upside down, it's a nine now  
Like Mannie, like Stunna, man, shit is big time now  
And I made a decision last night that I would die for it  
  
[Hook]  
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)  
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)  
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)  
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)  
  
[Outro]  
Make me feel the same way that I did to you  
Trust me when I say I'll go without you  
Trust me when I say that shit is old moves  
God made himself a way from me to you  
Tried to kill me but they still want the Views  
Tried to kill me but they still want the Views  
Tried to kill me but I am very much alive on the six side  
Yeah, I said I am very much alive on the six side  
I said I am....

Yeah uh yeah  
These are my one St Thomas flows  
Me and my n-ggas and some madonna hoes  
That look just like virgins but trust they down to go  
Discussin' life and all our common goals  
Smart kids that smoke weed, honor roll  
Look how the champagne diamonds flow  
Find dining, pour another another glass when the wine is low  
I'm in the crib stackin' money from here to the ceilin'  
Whatever it is I got is clearly appealin'  
These other rappers gettin' at it very you feelin  
I hope you feel it in your soul spiritual healin'  
Take a look at yourself the mirror's revealin'  
If you ain't got it you ain't got it the theory is brilliant  
People ask how music is goin' I heard it pays  
I just came off makin' 2 million in 30 days  
Damn I guess it does what the message was  
Sometimes I feel I be spendin' my money just because  
But weezy I'm just out here reppin' us  
Till I get to shake the hand of the man that's blessin' us  
Yeah, I know these n-ggas miss the mean lyrics  
Kush got the room smellin' like teen spirit  
I asked kindly if no-one out here would bring there feet up  
Until I lose for now I'm the game's single leader  
I fly private so no-one tells me to bring my seat up  
And book a suite when me and your favorite singer meet up  
Who you like, tell me who it is  
Imma make sure that that women is the next one on my list  
I should call it a night but f-ck it I can't resist  
This one is for all my n-ggas from my city tryin to diss  
Without a responce from me you really fail to exist  
And I love to see you fail that feelin' there is the sh-t  
I swear, aghh p-ssy n-gga get your bread up  
Enjoy the seat that the steward just forced your ass to let up  
Why your scary ass lookin' down pick your head up  
No-one told you your disguise is the most ridiculous gettup  
With nose plugs in now I can smell a set up  
  
So your just wastin your time your just only makin me better  
Yeah I try to tell them don't judge me because you heard stuff  
Chasin' cash that's my brother from the surf club  
Damn that n-gga always kept it so hood  
Back when we would smoke good  
At the oakwoods  
And have girls fall through like coins in a couch  
Now we just f-ckin all the b-tches they warned us about  
Scared for the first time everything has clicked  
What if I don't really do the numbers they predict  
Considerin the fact that I'm the one that they just picked  
To write a chapter in history this sh-t has got me sick  
Lyrics courtesy of www.Killerhiphop.com  
But if I really do it don't expect to get a split  
Cause this truly is some sh-t I don't expect you all to get  
I'm nervous but I'm about to kill it cause they about to let the realist team
in  
Throwin up in a huddle n-gga Willie beamin  
Were still throwin touchdown passes  
And tore his frame glasses  
Hopin that someone catch it  
People say that oh drake we started to miss it  
But they need to be a little more specific man is this what yall want?  
And my best chris tucker impression  
Ducking your questions  
F-ck your suggestions  
Money gets all of my love and affection  
Cars all black like the cover of essence  
I'm allergic to comin in second  
But I never sneeze  
N-gga YMOE n-gga yeeah  
Uh, yeah, this want yall want  
Octobers Very Own

Thank me later in this b-tch wasssup  
Free Weezy in this b-tch wasup  
June 15th in this b-tch wasup

Diamoexplainnds hang around my neck, the crib is all finished  
No love for these bitches I said this year it's all business  
It is a shame that a couple of 'em are off limits  
No offence to my nigga, it's just the industry is small  
We all lust for the same women  
You know the ones we saw before we came in it  
I know he ain't trippin'  
I know I got a couple things that lil' wayne dipped in  
Ain't ashamed to admit it, I be the same with it  
This shit is all about hits and misses  
The ones that you fuck and the ones that you wife up  
Don't let them fuck your life up  
  
Half a mill to perform, I can't let them fuck that shit up  
Plus I love the way my middle name looks when it's lit up  
Jim moore got me dressing like a leading man  
A little favour for a friend when I need a hand  
Young frank, suits cut right always  
Just got a couple warhol's for my hallways  
New verses crush the hood like I'm driving into something  
Bitches on the kid like I'm iverson of something  
Like a sixer, since I sold 680 in my first  
Drizzy drake, the only one that got the gift without the curse  
Swag!

Spending every moment in the studio  
I'd never said it'd be fair  
But when you're all alone I hope you truly know  
How bad I want to be there  
  
[Chorus]  
Come right here  
Set your bag down  
I took a night off for you  
Go ahead and turn the lights off  
But keep your heels on  
They're fittin' for what I'm about to do  
  
No you ain't explainin' how you want it done  
Just be quiet I'll do fine without ya help girl  
Can you work without a second for some fun  
Now you finally got a moment to yaself girl  
And I know what to do with it  
I know what to do with it  
I know what to do with it  
I know what to do with it  
  
I been waitin for so long to get you all alone  
Now I finally got you right here  
So baby I'm a lock my door and disconnect my phone  
'Cause I wanna make one thing clear  
I want you on top  
So let ya hair down  
I took the night off for you  
Girl I'm gonna turn the lights off  
But keep ya heels on  
They're fittin' for what we're about to do  
  
[Chorus]  
  
No you ain't explainin how you want it done  
Just be quiet I'll do fine without ya help girl  
Can you work without a second for some fun  
Now you finally got a moment to yaself girl  
And I know what to do with it  
I know what to do with it  
I know what to do with it  
I know what to do with it  
  
Oh oh. It's 6 o'clock in the morning at the studio

[Drake:]  
It's Southern Smoke Boy!  
Ho, Yeah, Uh huh  
It's Trey Songz and uh, D-are-A-K-K-E  
Ahahaha, the boy of summer are here man  
Ayo Track, I got something mean for this one boy  
  
[Verse 1: drake]  
Chances Are Most of the day you was lying around  
I made money that's why these girls eyeing me down  
By nineteen I might seem desitend for millions  
Promoters on my ass so I'm guessing they filled  
In I take q's from my big boy popz  
I'm the only young dude that the big boys watch  
They getting foul on the star  
But it's all eyes on me like I'm coppin some vows for the bar  
Get it guess not picture me not strive  
To land in the top ten slip in the top five  
Same thing in the top four trust I'm hot boy  
Maybe even the top three Trey you got me  
Now a day I peep they intrests  
Specialy when lifes bringing them pain and lately they been stressed  
Money making brothers should take notes  
See broke niggas is the problem and us is the scape goat  
Some body get the waiter they need a second plate a  
This knowledge if you aint got it you could catch it later  
My money then lovers seperate for I commit the date up  
I put a split in the middle then I seperater  
  
[Chorus: trey songz]  
It aint about the rims on my truck  
Aint about the ice on my watch  
Aint about teh coop of my truck  
Baby it's about the Game  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Ridin' low  
Layed back in the seat when I creep  
That's just how I roll  
With some fresh nice ones on my feet  
That's it goes  
And I'm tryin' to find a chick I can meet who ain't about the dough  
Cause it ain't all about that no more  
  
[Chorus: trey songz]  
It aint about the rims on my truck  
Aint about the ice on my watch  
Aint about teh coop of my truck  
Baby it's about the Game  
  
It aint about the shoes that I've got  
Aint about my dough or my rocks  
Ain't the life I live, it don't stop  
Baby it's about the game  
  
[Verse 3: trey songz]  
When you ask why I'm hustlin' in the streets that's just who I be  
Yo, I live for the dough, for the flow, for feelin' free  
Ain't too many other dudes you can choose to get this luxury  
But without it all I'm still about the game  
  
[Bridge:]  
The haters wanna hate, but it ain't nothing  
Because the ladies choose to love me (they love me for what I do)  
  
[Chorus x2: trey songz]  
It aint about the rims on my truck  
Aint about the ice on my watch  
Aint about teh coop of my truck  
Baby it's about the Game  
  
It aint about the shoes that I've got  
Aint about my dough or my rocks  
Ain't the life I live, it don't stop  
Baby it's about the game  
  
[Verse 4:]  
Ridin' low  
Layed back in the seat when I creep  
That's just how I roll  
With some fresh nice ones on my feet  
That's it goes  
And I'm tryin' to find a chick I can meet who ain't about the dough  
Cause it ain't all about that no more  
  
[Bridge:]  
The haters wanna hate, but it ain't nothing  
Because the ladies choose to love me (they love me for what I do)  
  
[Chorus x2: trey songz]  
It aint about the rims on my truck  
Aint about the ice on my watch  
Aint about teh coop of my truck  
Baby it's about the Game  
  
It aint about the shoes that I've got  
Aint about my dough or my rocks  
Ain't the life I live, it don't stop  
Baby it's about the game

Yo I wake up every morning, shower, gather my belongings  
Head to works, I get some breakfast 'cause, still a nigga yawning  
From the night before, at the club I was up I'm tryna live  
Only twenty two my nig, 'bout to be twenty three ya dig?  
Time don't wait for none of us that's why I gotta chase my dreams  
Make my momma proud so she can show off all her pearly teeth  
And be half the man my dad was, I thank God he was in my life  
I realize how many [?]  
Either I, need to make this music work or move from the Earth  
I'm preachin' fire, need a choir, 'bout to take you all to church  
My congregation bombed the nation with this HIP HOP  
We in the race to fame, blowin' pass the PIT STOPS  
I heard the prize was some chicks and a WRIST WATCH  
And all you gotta do is go to jail or GET SHOT  
Yeah Nick cop but he ain't never get popped  
How we gonna get pop fans? Give 'em a quick shot  
Now I get ya chick hot with my wrist watch  
Yeah shorty drip drop when it tick tock  
It's kinda sick huh? Ay Jay, put it in the heart of Pickering  
And tell them niggas this is NICK'S SPOT  
They don't keep it fresh enough I got it zip locked  
Saran wrap, anthrax, it make ya sick huh  
I'm hot as fire wanna put me out with piss huh  
[?]  
  
[CHORUS:]  
It ain't as easy as it looks, we go through some shit  
You cut us a check, then we go through some hits  
Then you show us respect, then we'll say you legit  
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM  
  
I'm tryna get that cash, then watch how tall it grows  
Soon as we get the ass, we start callin' 'em hos  
The concept you don't grasp, I'm guessin' you too old  
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM  
  
[DRAKE:]  
Ayo I stay up every evening, write that shit that they believe in  
DJs run it, they approach me, and it's praise I be receiving  
From the night befo', at the club, fake I.D. my record spins  
Got me dancin' right outside since these niggas won't let me in  
Well guess again, slip around the back and get it crackin'  
And all the bottles wrapped in cellophane [?]  
Hundred grand, Nickle F, that nigga's the next to win  
Virgina go rep for him, and Memphis represent for me  
To the tenth 10 degree, Tennekey, T Dot to the country ya'll  
Orangemen and White Haven, an back up north to Montreal  
I ain't ashamed, my city ain't on the map  
[?] Light that fire, realize they ain't born to rap  
[?] Pass the torch and sell they soul [?]  
Maybe they can bring they career back  
But these niggas right here ain't tryna hear that  
Cause I'm on set, make it work, break even on 9 to 5's  
Cigarettes and lotto tickets, tryna keep that grind alive  
All my uncles, they hit the casino when they get they check  
My cousins, they paint they [?] to get respect  
This can't be life, dominoes and [?] dro and twenty stacks  
[?]  
[?]  
Rest In Peace to SKUMMY this reality not funny rap!  
You think it's funny till these youngings suck a bunny  
Pull the jack rabbit out and get to screamin' where the money at!  
  
[CHORUS:]  
It ain't as easy as it looks, we go through some shit  
You cut us a check, then we go through some hits  
Then you show us respect, then we'll say you legit

I'm tryna get that cash, then watch how tall it grows  
Soon as we get the ass, we start callin' 'em hos  
The concept you don't grasp, I'm guessin' you too old  
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM

[Verse:]  
All right!  
She'll be jumping up and down,  
Trying to fit that ass in.  
Took her half an hour just to get that...  
All she wanna talk about is party and the fashion,  
I don't know where she's going and I do not plan on asking at all  
Cause her spirit is free,  
And she lets nobody else in except for me  
If her basement is locked, then I swear she would agree  
I'm the only one she loves, there's no copy of the key  
Homie that's a guarantee  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Don't forget that fendi purse that you put all your cash in,  
Kinda' hard to concentrate when cameras are flashing.  
Other dudes will suffocate her, I don't want her gaspin,  
Don't know where she's going, and I do not plan on asking at all  
I've never been the type felt a like my connection  
With niggas that wanna fight over women, that's not right,  
There's too many in the world, homie you could have yo pick  
But I swear that one's my girl, I swear that one's my girl

[Intro]  
Oh man, oh man, oh man, not again  
  
[Verse]  
Yeah, I learned the game from William Wesley  
You can never check me  
Back to back for the niggas that didn't get the message  
Back to back like I'm on the cover of Lethal Weapon  
Back to back like I'm Jordan '96, '97  
Whoa, very important and very pretentious  
When I look back I might be mad that I gave this attention  
Yeah, but it's weighin' heavy on my conscience  
Yeah, and fuck, you left The Boy no options  
I wanna see my niggas go insane  
You gon' make me step out of my fuckin' frame  
You gon' make me buy bottles for Charlamagne  
You gon' make me go out of my fuckin' way  
I waited four days, nigga, where y'all at?  
I drove here in the Wraith playin' AR-AB  
I'm not sure what it was that really made y'all mad  
But I guess this is what I gotta do to make y'all rap  
I mean woah, can't fool the city, man, they know what's up  
Second floor at Tootsies, gettin' shoulder rubs  
This for y'all to think that I don't write enough  
They just mad cause I got the midas touch  
You love her, then you gotta give the world to her  
Is that a world tour or your girl's tour?  
I know that you gotta be a thug for her  
This ain't what she meant when she told you to open up more  
Yeah, trigger fingers turn to twitter fingers  
Yeah, you gettin' bodied by a singin' nigga  
I'm not the type of nigga that'll type to niggas  
And shout-out to all my boss bitches wife-in niggas  
Make sure you hit him with the prenup  
Then tell that man to ease up  
I did another one, I did another one  
You still ain't did shit about the other one  
I got the drink in me goin' back to back  
Yeah, goin' back to back  
I got the drink in me goin' back to back  
Yeah, I'm goin' back to back  
I don't wanna hear about this ever again  
Not even when she tell 'em that they better as friends  
Not even when you sayin', "Drizzy, tell 'em again"  
I been puttin' on a show, it was a sell out event  
Oh, you need better seatin'  
I didn't wanna do it, gave me every reason  
The point I'm tryna make is I don't ever need 'em  
Seen what you'd do for fame or what you'd do for freedom  
Please, check 'em for a wire or a earpiece  
Please, please do not let these niggas near me  
Please, think before you come for the great one  
Please, who's a real nigga and who ain't one?  
Please, somebody stop me  
I'm talkin' boasy and gwanin wassy  
I got the fest in five days and it's my shit  
Soon as a nigga hit the stage, they gon'  
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back  
Yeah, they want it back to back  
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back  
I took a break from Views, now it's back to that, nigga

[Hook:]  
I'm black and Jewish  
Don't be so foolish  
I'm black and Jewish  
It's a Mitzvah  
  
[Verse]  
Please don't forget I'm black, please don't forget I'm Jewish  
I play ball like Lebron and I know what a W-2 is  
Chillin' in Boca Raton with my mensch, Lenny Kravitz  
The only purple drink we sip is purple Manischewitz  
At my show, you won't simply put your hands in the air  
We can also raise a chair or recite a Jewish prayer  
  
[Interlude]  
Like Baruch [?] Yisrael  
[?] Kim Kardashian Kanye West, amen  
I eat Hova with nova, knishes with my bitches  
A bagel and cream cheesy with my boy, his name is Weezy  
Do not go to Feingold's, though  
The pickles are rubber  
And I will not be harmin' yah  
I read the Old Testament, okra and matzahball, I'll eat the rest of it  
I celebrate Hanukkah, dated Rihannakah  
Birth right in Israel, mama from Canada  
Daddy from Africa  
Both of best worlds when you're Jewish with black in ya'  
Challah!

Yeah, isn't it amazing how you talk all this shit and we still lack
communication  
How beautiful our kids will be, girl, I don't need convincing  
How every conversation starts with "this time will be different" oh  
Oh the idea's fun  
Oh the idea's fun  
Oh the idea is so fun every time  
At least we try for home run every time  
  
Swangin', eyes closed just swangin'  
Same city, same friends if you're looking for me  
Same city, same friends if you're looking  
I'll be here just swangin'  
Don't talk to me like I'm famous  
And don't assume 'cause I don't expect assumptions babe  
I'm just tryna connect with somethin' babe, yeah swangin' eh  
  
She just wanna run around the city and make memories that she can barely
remember  
And I'd allow her, talk about pussy power  
Yea she just wanna run over my feelings  
Like she drinkin' and drivin' in an 18 wheeler and I'd allow her,  
Talk about pussy power  
She used to say "You can be whoever you want, even yourself"  
Yeah, I show up knowin' exactly who I was and never leave as myself  
But when it falls apart, I'm always still down  
To pick a million tiny little pieces off the ground  
'Cause you would learn to love people and use things and not the other way
around  
  
Swangin', eyes closed just swangin'  
Same city, same friends if you're looking for me  
Same city, same friends if you're looking  
I'll be here just swangin' eh  
Don't talk to me like I'm famous eh  
And don't assume cause I don't expect assumptions babe  
I'm just tryna connect with somethin' babe I'll be here just swangin'  
  
I remember when my schedule was as flexible as she is  
She call and tell me be here before the sun up I be dressed before we hung up  
I take Eglinton to 401 east and  
Exit at Markham road in the east end  
Where all the pretty girls are sleeping  
My license been expired I renew it after the weekend  
Fuck I know I said that shit the last 7 weekends  
Girl I guess procrastination is my weakness  
I hate stoppin' for gas this late 'cause this nigga's creepin' and I like how
we're creepin'  
Summer is comin' know you could feel it  
20 on pump whatever I ain't got enough to fill it  
Won't knock on your door  
My uncle say, "You drive my whip like it's yours"  
I got the pedal to the floor  
I'm on my motherfuckin' way swangin'  
  
Don't fall asleep on me, hang in there  
I'll be there just swangin'  
I'll be there just swangin'  
I treat you good girl like you're famous  
I know I'm late it's always the same shit  
But don't fall asleep on me, hang in there  
I'm on the road right now swangin, girl

[Chorus:]  
Somebody remind me where I am  
That's right I'm at home, Yeah I'm right where I belong  
Girl you say you feeling faded well me too  
The smoke is getting blown and the drinks is super strong  
I know they aint getting money like we do  
So it's on. I was looking for the one  
Now I'm feeling dumb for thinking it was you  
I was wrong now I'm back up in this bitch going harder than I did  
Watch me do it  
And I'mma do it all  
Feeling like the old me  
You don't even know me  
I'mma do it all  
I'mma do it all  
Probably why I'm back up in this bitch going harder than I did  
Watch me do it...  
  
[Drake - Verse 1]  
Tonight I'm into breaking up  
Somebody's home  
I'm drunk as ever  
I'm not alone, I'm with my people  
I know you love it  
I don't jus do it  
I over does it  
I be getting money so long  
It's just paper to me  
Take all my memories with you and just erase it for me  
You can never reminisce when you forget it all  
Careful what you wish for, you just might get it all  
Now my life is angel hair and pignot grigio  
Baby forget about it  
I'm headed wherever this muthf-cking jet is routed  
You can't have my heart the doctor told me I'd be dead without it  
My judgements never clouded  
That's why I'm steady yelling weatherman weatherman  
I'm bout whatever man  
I'm tryna fuck with tinkerbell in never neverland  
But I'm polite about it  
Baby after you  
I've had a glass or two so somebody remind me where I am  
  
[Chorus:]  
-that's right I'm at home, Yeah I'm right where I belong  
Girl you say you feeling faded well me too  
The smoke is getting blown and the drinks is super strong  
I know they aint getting money like we do  
So it's on. I was looking for the one  
Now I'm feeling dumb for thinking it was you  
I was wrong now I'm back up in this bitch going harder than I did  
Watch me do it  
And I'mma do it all  
Feeling like the old me  
You don't even know me  
I'mma do it all  
I'mma do it all  
Probably why I'm back up in this bitch going harder than I did  
Watch me do it  
  
[Drake - Verse 2]  
Tryna get the green like I'm waiting at a long light  
Broke just doesn't suit me girl and every night is prom night  
Where'd I put my bow tie  
Millionnaire multi  
Rest in peace to B. I. G and praises to the most high  
Getting stupid paid off of smart decisions  
I'm the man now, I guess that parts a given  
Someone please tell me the problem with my competition  
I ask what's up and they just always say the cost of livin'  
I live from it though, I've been down and I got up  
Bring a hundred thousand to the club and light your spot up  
And me falling and landing in love I don't think should happen  
Because everythings easier to get into than get out of  
But someone show me to the owner of this city  
Cause the owners always seem to be the only people with me  
I'm still the mafia, still run the commitee  
Ny forever nigga, Diddy,  
  
[Chorus:]  
Somebody remind me where I am  
That's right I'm at home, Yeah I'm right where I belong  
Girl you say you feeling faded well me too  
The smoke is getting blown and the drinks is super strong  
I know they aint getting money like we do  
So it's on. I was looking for the one  
Now I'm feeling dumb for thinking it was you  
I was wrong now I'm back up in this bitch going harder than I did  
Watch me do it  
And I'mma do it all  
Feeling like the old me  
You don't even know me  
I'mma do it all  
I'mma do it all  
Probably why I'm back up in this bitch going harder than I did  
Watch me do it

Uh yea alright  
Uh well alright  
Yea well alright  
Uh huh... Yea  
Gasps  
Feel good  
  
[Verse 1:]  
It's a celebration clap clap bravo lobster and shrimp  
And a glass of miskato for the girl whose  
A student and her friends whose a model  
Finished the whole bottle... And we gonna do it big like this  
Yea and he was just practice he ain't  
In your world you can take him off ya atlas  
Girl ya on fire can I be the one you match with  
I give you the credit card and baby you can max this outtt  
Show me where ya tax is show me where ya hands at  
Maybe I can grasp it they say if ya get her  
You can understand her better  
And she known to be a cheater but that's only if you let her  
Yea... And I got it together so when they  
Talk they try to turn me it's like whatever  
... Tell em' I appreciate the help but I just gotta know for myself  
  
Yea uh  
Uh look  
Uh  
  
[Verse 2:]  
This lifestyle is foul this shit'll damage her  
Especially when you think nobody is understanding ya  
These girls groups with they overprotected managers  
Got paparazzi over my shoulders clickin they cam-er-a  
Snap snap snap until they runnin outta card space  
You remind me of Tony's sister in scarface  
Just take it easy on love and slow ya heart rate  
? Girl it's graces on top is such a hard place?  
Yea... But if you never even been there  
You kinda make sense why you dying of pretendin  
Spillin all ya drinks takin pictures of ya swimwear  
Head up in the clouds you survivin on the thin air  
I know that shit is exhausting girl  
And your mistakes are costing girl  
And maybe you don't need the help but I just wanna see for myself

[Talking:]  
I do this for ya'll man  
Malice, Nickelus F, it's the remix!  
  
[Verse 1: Malice]  
  
[Background:]  
Are-E you-P G-A-N-G  
Are-E you-P G-A-N-G  
  
[Chorus:]  
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall  
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball  
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all  
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall  
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do  
Do's what you do, I do what I do  
  
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall  
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball  
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all  
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall  
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do  
Do's what you do, I do what I do  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Check, the verses I'm writing you might wanna learn it  
You hatin my song but your wife wanna burn it  
So now you at the store for some blank cds  
You can't see me, for your sake might wanna return it  
Cause, if you bring them discs home to ya girl, she'll forget you  
And I'll be the only one she concerned with  
To the people that ignored me before this  
This one is for you as a song re-recorded  
Funny thing is, you just notice me now but I was here along  
Your vision's just been distorted  
I'm so [?] I live this, you ask me what the business  
And I write a sixteen and record it, uh  
The waiting is over I think music need it  
Drake cuttin his records without gettin weeded  
People in the South want it chopped and screwed, I got this dude  
They expectations Imma exceed it uh  
Like a singer with only backgrounds ya'll record it  
When it's done ya lyrics tend to mislead ish  
Finally here Imma star with the timing  
My swagger is chill, and my flow is reclining  
This for anybody that's searchin for cash, a purchase [?]  
You only get the dough when you grindin  
And so I grind like I'm listening to I Wayne  
My pain, you can experience through the rhyming boy!  
  
[Chorus:]  
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall  
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball  
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all  
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall  
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do  
Do's what you do, I do what I do  
  
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall  
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball  
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all  
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall  
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do  
Do's what you do, I do what I do  
  
[Verse 3: Nickelus F]  
  
[Chorus:]  
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall  
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball  
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all  
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall  
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do  
Do's what you do, I do what I do  
  
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall  
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball  
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all  
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall  
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do  
Do's what you do, I do what I do

When a good thing goes bad it's not the end of the world  
It's just the end of a world, that you had with one girl  
And she's the reason it happened, but she's overreacting  
And it's all because she don't want things to change  
  
[Chorus]  
So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you  
That's the wrong thing to do  
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you  
That's the wrong thing to do  
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you  
That's the wrong thing to do  
Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying  
And say I love you too  
  
But I need someone different  
You know it, oh ho, you know it  
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it  
I need someone different  
You know it, oh ho, you know it  
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it  
Something's been missing  
You know it, oh ho, she knows it  
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it  
I need someone different (oh ho, oh ho)  
  
We live in a generation of, not being in love, and not being together  
But we sure make it feel like we're together  
Cause we're scared to see each other with somebody else  
  
[Chorus]  
  
But I need someone different  
You know it, oh ho, you know it  
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it  
I need someone different  
You know it, oh ho, you know it  
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it  
Something's been missing  
You know it, oh ho, she knows it  
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it  
I need someone different (Oh ho, oh ho)

Don't f-ck with me, don't f-ck with me  
Don't f-ck with me, don't f-ck with me  
  
[Drake - Verse 1]  
I got car money, fresh start money  
I want Saudi money, I want art money  
I want women to cry and pour out their heart for me  
And tell me how much they hate it when they apart from me  
Yeh, and lately I do bitches the meanest  
Tell em I love em and don't ever mean it  
We go on dates I send the Maybach out the neighbourhoods, they never seen it  
That shit is dangerous but it so convenient  
I aint lying, yeah  
And comfortable I sit  
That manual Ferrari Italian, some fly shit  
It's sittin' at the house like I bought it in '9-6  
Cause honestly I'm too f-cking busy to drive stick  
I swear, too f-cking busy, too busy f-cking  
This nigga girl, but to me she wasn't  
Been hot before they open doors for me  
Preheated oven, I'm in this so  
But I aint finished though  
It's been a minute though  
My newest girl back home, got issues with parents  
And some charges, how the f-ck can I get her to Paris  
Luckilly, I'm the greatest my country's ever seen  
So chances are I get the border to issue me clearance  
Dreams money can buy  
Everybody yelled surprised I wasn't surprised  
That's only cause I been waitin' on it, nigga  
So f-ck whoever hatin on a nigga  
Of course  
  
Don't f-ck with me, don't f-ck with me  
  
Don't, don't f-ck with me, don't f-ck with me  
Don't, don't f-ck with me, don't f-ck with me  
Don't, don't f-ck with me, don't f-ck with me  
Don't...  
  
Food from India, she in Charlotte Olympia's  
We talked music for hours she never mentioned ya  
Can't tell you how much I love when niggas think they got it  
And I love the fact that line made 'em think about it  
Ymcmb these niggas make it so hard to be friendly when I know part of it's
envy  
Tryna fill the shoes, nigga so far these are empty  
I take 'em off in the house because the throw carpets are Fendi  
Ohh, I never seen the car you claim to drive  
Shit I seen it, you just aint inside  
And I feel like lately I went from top 5 to remaining 5  
My favourite rappers either lost it or they aint alive  
And they tryna bring us down me, Weezy and Stunna  
We stayed up, Christmas lights in the middle of summer  
And if the girl standing next to me got a fat ass  
Then I'll probably give her my number  
Yeah, I throw my dollars up high  
And they land on the stage, dance on  
We got company coming over  
Would it kill you to put some pants on  
Dreams money can buy  
They told me it's like a high, it wasn't a lie  
Yeah, just have some good p-ssy waiting on a nigga  
And f-ck whoever hatin' on a nigga  
  
Don't f-ck with me, don't f-ck with me  
Don't, don't f-ck with me, don't f-ck with me  
Don't, don't f-ck with me, don't f-ck with me  
Don't, don't f-ck with me, don't f-ck with me  
Don't...

[Intro]  
Yeah, yeah  
  
[Hook]  
I've been down so long it look like up to me  
They look up to me

Somethin' ain't right when we talkin'  
Somethin' ain't right when we talkin'  
Look like you hidin' your problems  
Really you never was all in  
No you can't son me, you won't never get to run me  
Just when shit look out of reach, I reach back like one, three  
Like one, three, yeah  
  
[Pre-Hook]  
That's when they smile in my face  
Whole time they wanna take my place  
Whole time they wanna take my place  
Whole time they wanna take my place  
Yeah, I know they wanna take my place  
I can tell that love is fake  
I don't trust a word you say  
How you wanna clique up after your mistakes?  
Look you in the face and it's just not the same  
  
[Hook]

That's when they smile in my face  
Whole time they wanna take my place  
Whole time they wanna take my place  
Whole time they wanna take my place  
Yeah, I know they wanna take my place

[Outro]  
Skrrt (skrrt, skrrt)

This is why I do this shit.  
I think they call this, uh, venting.  
  
Yea  
Look  
Uh  
  
This is me.  
Still the same.  
They want the hits.  
I play the game.  
No auto tune, but you can feel the pain.  
It all comes spilling out like I hit a vein.  
What up lil' braw.  
What up slumville.  
I hope you know that y'all the reason I have fun still.  
The fans thinking that we all signed for one mill.  
Equal opportunities rapping, that shit is unreal.  
That ain't how it works.  
That ain't that how it goes.  
And I been getting high to balance out the lows.  
And I could use a writer to balance my flows.  
But I never share my thoughts,  
This is all a nigga knows.  
And every time I try, it opens up my eyes.  
These verses are a chance to remembered and reprized.  
And I would be performing just as long as I'm alive.  
So every word I utter will be mine.  
  
Don't believe the lies.  
Look me in my eyes.  
Please don't be scared of me.  
Please don't be scared of me.  
I remember you.  
This feeling isn't new.  
So please don't be scared of me.  
Please don't be scared of me.  
  
Don't take this the wrong way but  
I never cried when Pac died.  
But I probably will when Hov does.  
And if my tears hold value,  
Then I would drop one for every single thing he showed us.  
And I'll be standing in a puddle.  
I stay away from niggas that could land me in some trouble.  
And Ima keep it honest.  
Am so tired of being subtle.  
It's just me, Forty, O, and Nich standing in a huddle.  
Staring at the members of my team.  
Who get questioned about they profit from this from million dollar scheme.  
Just know that am in debt for you defending all our dreams.  
I hope you tell your family this shit ain't what it seems.  
But yall the reason for a lot of my devotion.  
You know I spend money because spending time is hopeless.  
And know I pop bottles cause I bottle my emotions.  
At least I put it all in the open.  
  
Don't believe the lies.  
Look me in my eyes.  
Please don't be scared of me.  
Please don't be scared of me.  
I remember you.  
This feeling isn't new.  
So please don't be scared of me.  
Please don't be scared of me.  
Oh oh oh oh oh uh.  
  
Look.  
Fuck all y'all.  
We ignore feelings here.  
Premature millionaires.  
Welcome to my realest year.  
Yeah.  
I swear we making a killer here.  
I should be on top of the world here just chillin' here.  
Uh.  
But it's funny having fans.  
Who find you before anybody ever has the chance,  
And build you up so you could be the biggest in the game.  
And realize when your there, sometimes the shit don't feel the same.  
Yeah.  
And plus things are just so real at home  
People think I've changed just because my appeal's grown  
And now security follow me everywhere  
So I'm never actually am alone, I just always feel alone.  
I think I'm scared of what the future holds.  
I was wishing for some things and now am used to those.  
Every girl I meet thinks I'm fucking groupie hoes.  
The honesty of my music has left me too exposed.  
All my old friends think I got a new crowd.  
And people seem to notice every time I do smile.  
I guess that mean they come few and far between.  
Even though am living out what you would call the dream.  
Yeah.  
And my uncle ain't even messaging me.  
And him missing in my life is kind of messing with me.  
I hope this isn't one of those forever things.  
It's funny how money can change everything.  
  
Don't believe the lies.  
Look me in my eyes.  
Please don't be scared of me.  
Please don't be scared of me.  
I remember you.  
This feeling isn't new.  
So please don't be scared of me.  
Please don't be scared of me.  
Oh oh oh oh oh uh.

[Verse]  
I should be downtown, whipping on the way to you  
You got something that belongs to me  
Your body language says it all  
Despite the things you said to me  
Who is it that's got you all gassed up?  
Changing your opinion on me  
I was only gone for the last few months  
But you don't have the time to wait on me  
  
[Hook]  
I try with you  
There's more to life than sleeping in  
And getting high with you

I'm more than just an option  
(hey, hey, hey)  
Refuse to be forgotten  
(hey, hey, hey)  
I took a chance with my heart  
(hey, hey, hey)  
And I feel it taking over  
  
I better find your lovin'  
I better find your heart  
I better find your lovin'  
I better find your heart  
I better find your lovin'  
I better find your heart  
I bet if I give all my love  
Then nothing's gonna tear us apart  
  
I'm more than just a number  
(hey, hey, hey)  
I doubt you'll find another  
(hey, hey, hey)  
So every single summer  
(hey, hey, hey)  
I'll be the one that you remember  
  
I better find your lovin'  
I better find your heart  
I better find your lovin'  
I better find your heart  
I better find your lovin'  
I better find your heart  
I bet if I give all my love  
Then nothing's gonna tear us apart  
  
It's more than just a mission  
(hey, hey, hey)  
You hear but you don't listen  
(hey, hey, hey)  
You better pay attention  
(hey, hey, hey)  
And get what you been missing

I bet if I give all my love  
Then nothing's gonna tear us apart  
  
Too many times I've been wrong  
I guess being right takes too long  
I'm done waiting, there's nothing left to do  
But give all I have to you and  
I better find your lovin'  
I better find your heart  
I better find your lovin'  
I bet if I give all my love  
Then nothing's gonna tear us apart  
  
I bet if I give all my love  
Then nothing's gonna tear us apart.

Money just changed everything, I wonder how life without it would go  
From the concrete who knew that a flower would grow  
Lookin' down from the top and its crowded below  
My fifteen minutes started an hour ago  
Truth over fame, you know I respect the blatant sh!t  
When I hear talkin', I just don't know what to make of it  
Hate is so familiar to me, I'm slowly embracing it  
Doesn't come natural, bear with me it could take a bit  
Yeah, and my dreams who I'm racing with  
You can see I'm pacin' it so that I'm always chasin' it  
Wayne put me right here, that's who I get the paper with  
I hope that my success never alters our relationship  
Yeah, this life is something I would die for  
Octobers Own, but its lookin' like July 4th  
I just wish they'd let you try it first  
This time I'm really goin' off, fireworks  
  
Today it begins  
I missed them before, but won't miss them again  
I keep having the same dream  
And I think I just realized what it means.  
  
All I see is fireworks, all I see is fireworks  
Every night its fireworks every night its fireworks  
All I see is fireworks all I see is fireworks  
Taking off like fireworks takin' off like oh-ah-oh-oh  
  
I'm just such a gentleman you should give it up for me  
Look at how I'm placing all my napkins and my cutlery  
I can tell it wasn't love I just thought you fuck with me  
Who coulda predicted love could strike now you stuck with me  
Damn I kept my wits about me luckily  
What happened between us that night it always seems to trouble me  
Now all of a sudden these gossip brags wanna cover me  
And you making it seem that it happened that way because of me  
But I was curious and I'll never forget it baby  
What an experience you coulda been the one but it wasn't that serious  
Their was smoke in the air before now its me clearing it  
That felt good, all and all I learned a lesson from it though  
You never see it coming you just get to see it go  
Yeah I shoulda looked up in the sky at first  
Now I can see it in her eyes, fireworks!  
  
Today it begins  
I missed them before, but won't miss them again  
I keep having the same dream  
And I think I just realized what it means.  
  
All I see is fireworks, all I see is fireworks  
Every night its fireworks every night its fireworks  
All I see is fireworks all I see is fireworks  
Taking off like fireworks takin' off like oh-ah-oh-oh  
  
Everything the same but it feels different  
My dad called me up knowing that I still listen  
And he's still got his foot out, guilt trippin'  
It's been years, though, I just learn to deal with it  
For real, me and my realtor we built up a better rapport  
Got my mother in a place with some better decor  
She searched the entire city I let her explore  
Ant now she's sayin' she's more lonely than every before  
How many of our parents' marriages lasted?  
I was only five, I bet I barely reacted  
I'm flying back home for the heritage classic  
Searchin' for that feeling, tell me where is the magic?  
Let's stay together 'til we're ghosts  
I want to witness love, I've never seen it close  
Yeah, but I guess I gotta find it first  
That's why I'm really going off, Fireworks  
  
Today it begins  
I missed them before, but won't miss them again  
I keep having the same dream  
And I think I just realized what it means.  
  
All I see is fireworks, all I see is fireworks  
Every night its fireworks every night its fireworks  
All I see is fireworks all I see is fireworks  
Taking off like fireworks takin' off like oh-ah-oh-oh

Tat my name on you girl so I know it's real  
Tat my fucking name on you so I know it's real  
  
[Verse:]  
Tell a bad bitch girl, lets go hang  
You know me, rolex, gold chain  
Fuck my young niggas, xo gang  
Get so drunk you forget yo name  
Incense, burning, smoking out to my own shit  
Got black wood in my white Range, I'm taking off when that light change  
I'm Drizzy Drake to my old bitches, Voodoo child to my new hoes  
I miss this and I want it back, So I'm all in with these new flows  
New flows, got new flows, rap is stress but it pays great  
Pimp flows 'n screw flows, my shit be sounding like grape tapes, now  
Lemme go an hit that cup, 1 time before a nigga hit that road  
These days keep going by too fast, so give anything that make shit go slow  
Yea, money in my safe, but I'm living dangerous  
They told me shit would change, but I don't really see no change in us  
  
[Hook:]  
Tat my name on you so I know it's real  
Tat my fucking name on you so I know it's real  
I know it hurts, But I aint tryna hear it

You'll still be mine, yea, you'll still be mine  
Tat my fucking name on you, when I go you'll still be mine, yea  
You'll still be mine, yea, I'll still be yours  
Tat my fucking name on you, let em know you love the boy, wassup  
  
[Verse 2:]  
I fondle the money, fornicate with a fortune  
I play with her mind, she masturbate with my Porsche  
It's simple love, simple math  
Her chest nice, not a wrinkle on her ass  
Puffin' purple hash welcome to my power circle  
Sucker free, no snitching, and we know when cowards working  
Rolls Royce rollin', rose gold rollie's  
Mba accountants, amounts they get unholy  
But mama still praying for her rubberband man  
  
When them wheels land, Travis Barker drums playin'  
Tap dance to my drum roll, I love a bitch that know to keep me one rolled  
  
[Hook: Drake]  
Tat my name on you so I know it's real  
Tat my fucking name on you so I know it's real  
I know it hurts, But I aint tryna hear it  
'Cause when I'm not around, I'll still be there in spirit  
You'll still be mine, yea, you'll still be mine  
Tat my fucking name on you, when I go you'll still be mine, yea  
You'll still be mine, yea, I'll still be yours  
Tat my fucking name on you, let em know you love the boy, wassup  
  
[Verse 3:]  
I don't have to work in the morning so I always stay for 1 more  
Fuck what they say, I'm telling you there's no side effects I'm sure  
Went from driving up on some old shit, to drivers opening doors  
This is my town, if you need something just ask for it's yours  
Yea, ask for it's yours, if you ask for it it's done  
I could Western Union some money, get your passport and then come  
You'll meet everybody I know, at first it might seem like a lot  
But they're all playing their role, Put that on everything that I got  
And all I care about is my city, man I can't say it enough  
I done heard things about y'all that they can't say about us  
I just hold it down for my side, I just hold it down for my sect  
I give everybody a piece of this, and I make due what's left  
Yea I do this shit to the death, yea I do this shit till I'm gone  
Yea, I told you that it's our world, and you're foolish thinking I'm wrong  
Stop asking how the fucking needle feel, tat my fucking name on you, let these
niggas know it's real, wassup  
  
[Hook:]  
Tat my name on you so I know it's real  
Tat my fucking name on you so I know it's real  
I know it hurts, But I aint tryna hear it  
'Cause when I'm not around, I'll still be there in spirit  
You'll still be mine, yea, you'll still be mine  
Tat my fucking name on you, when I go you'll still be mine, yea  
You'll still be mine, yea, I'll still be yours  
Tat my fucking name on you, let em know you love the boy, wassup

Uh, Focus on women then you get less done  
It's light work, the flow is heavy like a wet sponge  
I'm gettin' rich 'cause I think bein broke is less fun  
Celebratin' Father's Day everyday, so don't get sonned  
Where you tryin' to go? I'm ready  
Pick any place in the world, the dough is comin' in steady  
I'm chillin' out with T, and Jay and Nico  
My city ain't a city that support they own people  
But I run it, you say something' about it? I doubt it  
I got this Gucci wallet, I do not leave home without it  
I'm bout it, I'm bout it, I'm standin' on these couches  
Sayin' "bring this booth a bottle, no we do not need a spout bitch! "  
Pardon me that was rude  
If you just started ballin' I say I'm bout to conclude  
What more is there to do? And why would I pretend?  
She call me and I hit it every time like 'SEND'... Damn.

Yeah, Look  
Me and 40 wildin', stylin', somewhere on a island  
Lay her down and fold her like that shit you put a file in  
We all get to pitch in and that's when it gets to pilin'  
And I'm callin' yo bluff, don't act like you don't me dialin'  
Never embellish, believe him 'cause he exist  
There's stars on my team but I lead the league in assists  
Never been a believer that previously exists  
I wonder what I'd be doin' when previously is this  
I do breakfast at the Ivy, you can grab some lunch to go  
Havin' dinner at Chateau's, right across from Lindsey Loooo-han  
Don't I treat you better than your ooo-old man  
He couldn't of done it like this sho' 'nuff  
I tend to dro' puff, I'm throwed and I'm high  
I guess I'm thrower up  
Tone it all down, my nigga grow up  
And tell me when you start gettin' paid to show up... Damn.

Look  
I know girls love Beyonc??  
Girls love to fuck with your conscience  
Girls hate when niggas go missing and shawty you ain't no different  
These days it's hard to meet women  
Feel like my love life is finished  
I've been avoiding commitment  
That's why I'm in this position  
I'm scared to let somebody in on this  
No new friends, no no no  
You know how this shit go  
You got your fair share of admirers that call your phone  
You try to act like it's just me, but I'm not alone  
But if you're alone then, say my name, say my name  
  
[Chorus]  
Say my name, say my name  
When no one is around you  
Say, 'Baby, I love you'  
If you ain't running games  
Say my name, say my name  
You actin' kinda shady, baby  
Why the sudden change?  
Say my name  
Say my name  
Say my name  
Say my name, say my name  
If no one is around you  
  
Yeah  
Uh  
Say my name, say my name  
'Cause those other men are practice  
And this ain't no time for actin'  
And this ain't no time for games  
And this ain't no time for uncertainty  
And this ain't no time for locking your phone and not coming home  
and startin' some shit when I'm in the zone  
This is why I've been saying  
No new friends, no no no  
You know how this shit goes  
This is not four years ago  
Time escapes me  
Now forget how it felt when this shit move slow  
I come through in whips that make a young boy take the long way home  
All my young boys 'round me saying, 'Get money and fuck these hoes'  
Where we learn these values? I do not know what to tell you  
I'm just trying to find a reason not to go out every evening  
I need someone that'll help me think of someone besides myself  
I need someone I leave through the front door with  
'Cause we don't wanna hide no more  
'Cause you're not shy no more  
Neither one of us wanna play the side no more  
No, I'm not alone  
Even though nothing was the same  
Let me get your ass alone  
Let me make you say my name  
Say my name  
  
[Chorus]

[Verse]  
You've been home for three whole days  
Actin' like you got chores to do  
Boy this house is way too clean  
I don't think there's nothing more to do  
Oh, you don't need that girl, she did it all wrong  
You was still you before she ever came along  
Get over it, get over it  
I mean I understand the pain  
Someone did me the same  
I just put that nigga in his place then I got over it  
Then I got over it and if you wanna know the truth  
  
[Pre-Hook]  
I think you should just get dressed and go out tonight  
Go out tonight  
Order you a drink, don't even overthink  
Call a couple friends you know you can have some fun with  
And go out tonight, go out tonight  
Cause you might just meet me  
  
[Hook] (x2)  
And I'm lookin' for, and I'm lookin' for  
And I'm lookin' for somebody to be with  
And I'm lookin' for what you're lookin' for  
Yeah, you might just meet me

[Verse 1]  
I am not a human, shout to all my moon men  
Yeah they call me Tune, got them bitches tuned in  
It's a crazy world, so I stay in mine  
And niggas don't cross the line, niggas stay in line  
Like welfare, I stay elsewhere  
Hotter than a devil? Nigga, hell yeah  
Rock-a-bye baby, homicide baby  
That's more tear drops, call me cry baby  
What you talking bout? Tell it to my 9  
Cut your tongue out, mail it to your moms  
I'm a young God, swagger unflawed  
Bitch, I'm in the building, you in the front yard  
Life's a bitch, naw, better yet a dumb broad  
And I bet I can fuck the world and make it cum hard  
Yeah, you boys is washed up  
And I'm shitting on em like two girls and one cup  
Weezy Baby aka Bring The Money Home  
Pull out the AK and pop you in your funny bone  
Laugh now, die later muthafucka  
You's a bitch like Zeta Phi Beta muthafucka  
  
[Hook]  
Yeah, I call it how I see you

Pussy ass nigga, I don't want your gonorrhea  
Pussy ass nigga, I don't want your gonorrhea

I'll let my goons rush you like Moscow  
Gun at your eyebrow, pow pow  
Man I ball hard even with five fouls  
Yeah, we in this bitch like tampons  
Dump you in the woods, now get your camp on  
Chokehold around this shit cause I'm so hands-on  
I get high as fuck and Polo sheets is what I lands on  
Back against the wall, my two feet is what I stand on  
Diva in the room, she blowing me just like a band horn  
Got her on her knees, the same knees that she be praying on  
Now she just text her girlfriend with a capital, "You can join"  
Yeah, what y'all wanna do? I'm all ears  
Smoking on that headband, call that shit Paul Pierce  
I'm just so ahead of my time like dog years  
Balled like Solange, India Arie, Britney Spears  
  
[Hook]  
  
[Verse 3, Drake]  
I am spending much more than I'm making  
On these cars and these vacations, is that too much information?  
I just bought a Lamborghini, I'm not even into racing  
With a windshield full of tickets cause I live right by the station  
I am trying to figure out why you so mad at me  
Yes, I'm with Young Money, tell the magazine stop asking me  
I be with the dread with the tattoos on his head  
And a flag the color red like a fucking low battery  
(Okay) Nigga peep the shit I'm wyling on

Big Mo, Big Red, two cups made of styrofoam  
Big cheese big bread call that shit a calzone

And we about to kill em, C4, Mr. Carter's home

Summer's mine

I wish that you would come and find me  
Just to tell me that I haven't changed, girl I needed that from you

[Hook:]  
But the good ones go  
The good ones go, if you wait too long  
But the good ones go  
The good ones go, if you wait too long  
So you should go  
You should go, before you stay too long  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Don't you go getting married, don't you go get engaged  
I know you're getting older, don't have no time to waste  
I shouldn't be much longer but you shouldn't have to wait  
Can't lose you, can't help it, I'm so sorry, I'm so selfish  
Uh, uh, I've been chilling in the city where the money's thrown high and the
girls get down  
In case you're starting to wonder why my new shit's sounding so H-town  
But when it's all done baby I'm yours if you're still around  
She knows, she knows, she knows

Tell me how you really feel, tell me how you really feel  
I would ask you what's the deal but y'all don't even got a deal  
Most niggas with a deal couldn't make a greatest hits  
Y'all a whole lot of things but you still ain't this  
I don't know no one that could tell me what to do  
Heard you never claimed the hood, heard the hood claimed you  
That can't sit well, oh well, ship sailed  
Still mine, all mine, cosign, cosign  
I pull up in yachts so big that they try to hit me with boat fines  
Hype Williams, Big Pimpin', yeah, just like the old times  
Same niggas from the old days, lot of sides on the same side  
OVO we a gold mine but I'm goin' gold in no time  
Doing plat, plat only, boys better back off me  
Hall of fame, hall of fame, like I'm shirt off, like I'm shirt off

Whole city goin' crazy, top 5 no debating  
Top 5, top 5, top 5 and the whole city rate me  
And I'm back inside a matrix and I said that we would make it  
Aim squad with some traitors, knew my niggas from the basement  
This ain't no met-along-the-way shit, we done really put some days in

When I say that I meant that  
I don't want to talk to you has-beens  
I don't want features from nan them  
I don't want features or nothin'  
You can't even get on my guest list  
They want me to go to the Met Gala

That Actavis Hi-Tech it don't matter  
We sittin' right on the courtside  
I know the players on both side  
I'm cashin' out, fuck a cosign  
I wear the chain like a bowtie  
I wear the ring like a fo'-five  
Keep a fo'-five for the po' guys  
Black tints, low profile  
Celebratin' everyday cause I'm really really fresh out the coke house  
Countin' up every single day  
'Bout to bring a whole 'nother whip out  
  
[Hook: Future]  
They gon' think I won a Grammy  
They gon' think I won a Grammy  
Swervin' out the Panoramic  
I'm hangin' out, they can't stand me  
They gon' think I won a Grammy  
They gon' think I won a Grammy  
They gon' think I won a Grammy  
They gon' think I won a Grammy  
I'm showin' out, they can't stand me  
I'm showin' out, they can't stand me  
I'm swervin' off, they can't stand me  
I'm err off, can't stand me  
They gon' think I won a Grammy  
They gon' think I won a Grammy  
They gon' think I won a Grammy  
They gon' think I won a Grammy

[Intro]  
You used to call me on my,  
You used to, you used to,  
Yeah  
  
[Hook]  
You used to call me on my cell phone,  
Late night when you need my love,  
Call me on my cell phone,  
Late night when you need my love  
And I know when that hotline bling  
That can only mean one thing,  
I know when that hotline bling,  
That can only mean one thing  
  
[Verse 1]  
Ever since I left the city you,  
Got a reputation for yourself now  
Everybody knows and I feel left out,  
Girl you got me down, you got me stressed out,  
Cause ever since I left the city, you,  
Started wearing less and goin' out more,  
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor  
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before,  
  
[Hook]  
You used to call me on my cell phone,  
Late night when you need my love,  
Call me on my cell phone  
Late night when you need my love  
I know when that hotline bling  
That can only mean one thing  
I know when that hotline bling  
That can only mean one thing  
  
[Verse 2]  
Ever since I left the city, you, you, you  
You and me we just don't get along,  
You make me feel like I did you wrong,  
Going places where you don't belong,  
Ever since I left the city, you,  
You got exactly what you asked for,  
Running out of pages in your passport,  
Hanging with some girls I've never seen before  
  
[Hook]  
You used to call me on my cell phone,  
Late night when you need my love,  
Call me on my cell phone,  
Late night when you need my love,  
And I know when that hotline bling,  
That can only mean one thing,  
I know when that hotline bling,  
That can only mean one thing  
  
[Verse 3]  
These days, all I do is  
Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else,  
Wonder if you're rolling up a backwoods for someone else,  
Doing things I taught you gettin' nasty for someone else  
You don't need no one else,  
You don't need nobody else, no,  
Why you never alone,  
Why you always touching road.  
Used to always stay at home, be a good girl.  
You was in the zone, yeah.  
You should just be yourself.  
Right now, you're someone else  
  
[Hook]  
You used to call me on my cell phone  
Late night when you need my love  
Call me on my cell phone  
Late night when you need my love  
And I know when that hotline bling  
That can only mean one thing  
I know when that hotline bling  
That can only mean one thing  
  
[Outro]  
Ever since I left the city...

That's what I'm talking about though, like you changed up  
You don't even fucking link nobody no more, you just dashing away like a Taxi  
Yo, you cheesed me dog  
  
[Verse:]  
Always felt like my vision been bigger than the bigger picture  
Crazy how you gotta wait until it's dark out to see who really with you  
Crazy how even when it miss ya, shit'll come back around and get ya  
Crazy like all my niggas, crazy like all my niggas  
Remember I deleted all my other girls numbers out the phone for you?  
Remember when you had to take the bar exam, I drove in the snow for you  
You probably don't remember half the shit a nigga did for you  
  
[Hook:]  
Ya, you ain't really fuck with me way back then girl, how bout now?  
Cause I'm up right now and you suck right now  
Aw, you thought you had it all figured out back then girl, how bout now?  
Cause I'm up right now and you suck right now  
You thought the little effort that you put in was enough girl, how bout now?  
Girl how bout now? How bout now girl?  
What about now girl? How bout now?  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Always been daddy's little angel  
I bought your dad a bunch of shit for Christmas, he ain't even say thank you  
I had no money, left from back when I was focused on the music  
I used to always try and burn you cds of my new shit  
You be like "who's this?"  
I be like "me, girl."  
You be like "oh word, true shit?"  
Then ask if we could listen to Ludacris  
And car rides made me feel like I was losing it  
Yeah, made me feel I have it like that  
Like I was average like that  
Started drinking way more than I used to  
People form habits like that, girl  
Yeah, man enough to tell you I was hurt that year  
I'm not even Christian I still went to church that year, guess  
I just had to pretend that year  
I ain't even see my friends that year  
Places that I should've been  
You ain't really fucked with me way back then but  
  
[Hook:]  
Ya, you ain't really fuck with me way back then girl, how bout now?  
Cause I'm up right now and you suck right now  
Aw, you thought you had it all figured out back then girl, how bout now?  
Cause I'm up right now and you suck right now  
You thought the little effort that you put in was enough girl, how bout now?  
Girl how bout now? How bout now girl?  
What about now girl? How bout now?

[Intro: Baka]  
Man don't live of a di hype huh?  
Real ting ay  
  
[Verse 1: Drake]  
Yeah, I pull up in Lexus' like it's '07  
I just hit a lick, I got to hit a next one  
Last year I know you learned your lesson  
I could GPS you if you need addressin'  
Boss up, I'm the bigger homie  
But I'm one year older than my lil homie  
'09 they was biddin' on me  
But I'm Young Money, got it written on me  
Ok now we got some action  
Everything I said, it happened  
That boy light as Michael Jackson  
But off verses, he been blackin'  
Chasin' women a distraction  
They wan' be on TV right next to me  
You cannot be here right next to me  
Don't you see Riri right next to me?  
I hate a rapper especially  
They feel the same, but they hide it  
They just discuss it in private  
Don't get along man, we tried it  
What's the point in even tryin'?  
I hate a goofy especially  
They always dyin' to mention me  
They gotta die out eventually  
I cannot give you the recipe  
You know the game is sold separately  
Swear I just had an epiphany  
It cost me 50 at Tiffany's  
Shout out to Tiffany, Stephanie  
They used to always come check for me  
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies  
I don't let it get to me  
  
[Hook: Drake]  
Done  
Look what I've done in my life  
I had to count it and count it again  
To make sure the money was right  
They love to talk  
Me, I'm just dunning the hype  
Me, I'm just dunning the hype  
Me I'm just done, done, done, done, done  
  
[Verse 2: Drake]  
I don't take this shit for granted  
I do my own propaganda  
I feel like Juelz Santana  
Leg hangin' out the Phantom  
6 cold like Alaska  
Views already a classic  
Roy outta here like NASA  
Bustin' 1's out the plastic  
Her gram too poppin' to fuck her  
The chain too heavy to tuck it, I'm serious  
I feed my family with this  
So don't play with my money this summer, I'm serious  
I don't run out of material  
You shouldn't speak on me, period  
You try to give 'em your side of the story  
They heard it, but they wasn't hearin' it  
They feeling a way and won't hide it  
Niggas done being silent  
Don't get along man, we tried it  
What's the point of even tryin'?  
I hate a goofy especially  
They always dyin' to mention me  
They gotta go, they gotta go  
They gonna die out eventually  
I cannot give 'em no empathy  
I'ma have B's when I'm 70  
They cannot fuck with the legacy  
I don't know what else is left for me  
After this no one a threat to me  
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies  
I don't let it get to me  
  
[Hook: Drake]  
Done  
Look what I've done in my life  
I had to count it and count it again  
To make sure the money was right  
They love to talk  
Me, I'm just done in the hype  
Me, I'm just done in the hype  
Me I'm just done, done, done, done, done

[Chorus]  
Emotions in this game run deep  
So before these haters kill me in my sleep  
I'd like to say it's been a pleasure  
Reppin' 'til my last second through  
Done a lot of shit they'll never get to do  
I'd like to say it's been a pleasure  
Honored to be somebody they mention  
But before these niggas stop payin' attention  
I'll just say it's been a pleasure  
You'll never be somebody they need  
Tomorrow ain't guaranteed  
So tonight we gon' do it like this  
Oh, for the H-Town  
Tonight I'm gon' make some money go  
For the H-Town  
  
Ladies and gentlemen,  
You're now listenin' to the Dirty South trillionaire ('naire)  
Keepin' it trill in there, been here and he's still in there (there)  
Pay attention, it's the beginnin' of a new era (era)  
Get a little closer you can see the view clearer (view clearer)  
It's like Lasik but are basic  
Ebonics if you're hooked on chronic and you can taste it  
Trace it, recognize the real when ya face it  
Ball up in the club gettin white boy wasted  
One shot of Patron, then another one to chase it  
Put me to the test, I won't pass it I'll ace it  
Been so many places, up and down the interstate  
Cities that I've never been, wonderin' if they fin' to hate  
Step up in the spot, let 'em look me in the grill (grill)  
So they can see it for they self that I keep it trill (I keep it trill)  
I paid the cost to be the boss and left a tip  
So it's all good (good) don't even trip  
Believe me it's been a pleasure  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Man I've been all over the world  
Tryin' to tell 'em 'bout the trill and what we been through (through)  
What we already done and what we fin' do (do)  
What we got into, what we gettin' into (to)  
When ties 'bout to cut it closer than a Ginsu ('su)  
Roll through Atlanta, Birmingham, Alabama ('bama)  
Jacksonville to Jackson, Mississippi spittin' grammar (spittin' grammar)  
From Shreveport ('port) down to New Orleans ('leans)  
And all points in between just to get the cream (cream)  
Me and my "II Trill" team on the road flippin' (flippin')  
Eight hours straight, no stops, no trippin' (trippin')  
Had to keep them heaters on 'em so it's no slippin' (slippin')  
Promote a play with show money, we were slow grippin' (slow grippin')  
Sometimes we rock the stage and put it down (down)  
Other times we had to fight and shoot it out of town (town)  
But we always made it home okay  
And we still on the road to this day  
I gotta say it's been a pleasure  
  
[Chorus]  
  
They say that you never really know  
What you got 'til it's gone and can't touch it (touch it)  
If it look too good to be true, you can't trust it (trust it)  
If you never had it (had it) then you can never miss it (miss it)  
But looks can be deceivin', so don't you get it twisted (twisted)  
Walked a lot of miles in these old school J's (J's)  
Thought of many ways, lookin' at back in the days (days)  
Like how to climb from in between a rock, and a hard place  
How to keep your cool when you're dealin' with a hard case (with a hard case)  
And how to duck, when the judge throw the book at you (the book at you)  
And it's a two-sided mirror that you're lookin' through (you're lookin'
through)  
The phone receiver's in your hand starin at your child (child)  
And your heart skips a beat every time they smile (smile)  
See that's how real life is and how it can be (can be)  
And how it's deeper then just comin' down candy (candy)  
So I'm just tryin' to play the cards that they hand me  
For those that overstood me, understand me  
It's been a pleasure  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'd like to say it's been a pleasure  
I'll just say it's been a pleasure

[Drake]  
Uhh, this verse starts as my snipers hit their marks  
And ya guards fall down from a rifle to the heart  
Like clap clap, let em fall slow  
I know you had you fears you can let them all go  
And most women are motivated so I act accordingly  
But this is so refreshing that it means a little more to me  
Dedicating time when I really can't afford to be  
I provide protection if you open up the door for me  
Couple stares, couple texts, couple dates  
Couple 'i think that we're ready's'  
Couple 'i think we should wait's'  
Are we acting like a couple, I'm just trying to get it straight  
Cause I'm over here convinced that it's too early for mistakes  
  
[Jhene Aiko - Chorus]  
You had to change up the game  
Oh the weather is not the same  
Now there's only cloudy days  
I can't stand the rain in July  
Oh July  
There were fireworks exploding (exploding)  
But now it's getting colder  
The leafs are turning colours  
Why, it's just not our season  
The one and only reason  
Baby oh baby oh  
When summer turn into fall  
  
[Drake - Verse 2]  
Damn, tell me where did all the magic go  
I follow all the rules and told you everything you had to know  
Had you over every night, every night was passionate  
Plus you met my mother even if it was an accident  
I'm confused tell me where we go wrong  
I wish shorty I would be with you so long  
I was planning on being something worth mentioning  
Energy invested in someone I saw potential in  
Who killed Chivalry they need to get their sentencing  
Meanwhile we argue and I can't get a sentence in  
And just as I predicted here we go again  
They always say the hottest love has the coldest end  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Jhene Aiko]  
See it's funny cause I never thought this would end but then the season
changed  
[Drake]  
You are my, you are my, you are my girl (I was your girl)  
Shoulda made, shoulda made, shoulda made you my World  
Shoulda made you everything to make you happy baby  
[Jhene Aiko]  
Can't wait for, can't wait for, can't wait for springtime  
And I will turn into a butterfly  
I will spread my wings and fly  
And I'm too fly for the sh-t  
Ohhh, I am Japanese if you please

[Hook]  
When I pull up on a nigga  
Tell that nigga back back  
I'm too good with these words  
Watch a nigga backtrack  
If I die, all I know is I'm a mother fuckin legend  
It's too late for my city  
I'm the youngest nigga reppin  
Oh my God, oh my God  
If I die, I'm a legend  
Oh my God, oh my God  
If I die, I'm a legend  
  
[Verse 1]  
I'm on first, I'm on tour  
Got a girl, she from the South  
Used to work, used to dance in Texas  
Now she clean the house  
Everyday, I was strugglin' to learn what life's about  
On my way, money taught me Spanish  
Make it andale  
Way up north, packed in Honda cars  
They 'ont know who we are  
Fuck em all, they only pussy niggas shootin at the star  
Right or wrong, I'ma write my wrongs  
They can't live this long  
You don't know where you're gonna go  
I got this shit mapped out strong  
  
[Pre-Hook]  
  
[Hook]  
When I pull up on a nigga

Why do I feel like you owe me one?  
6 G-O-D I'm the holy one  
Yeaaah, you know wassup  
They been off for a minute now  
You know they all sentimental now  
You know they all actin' different now  
And I, I just can't pretend  
Seen too much, it's so hard for me to let new people in  
I can't change, this shit set in stone  
They can't live this long  
You don't know where you're gonna go  
I got this shit mapped out strong  
  
[Hook]  
When I pull up on a nigga  
Tell that nigga back back

[Verse 1:]  
Uh, when did you get like this  
Least you coulda done is gone an give me a warning  
I don't regret like this  
So I'll be right there when you wake up in the morning  
Saying, this just ain't my style  
You can't say you're happy either  
You don't even smile, for me  
  
[Chorus:]  
Did you agree, we should let it be  
And did you agree, it's a must,  
Let's call the whole thing off  
We used to had enough of us  
Let's call the whole thing off  
We used to had enough of us  
  
[Verse 2:]  
When you decided to knock on my door  
Did you remember what happened before  
The look on your face said you were expecting more  
But some things look better inside of the store  
  
[Chorus:]  
Did you agree, we should let it be  
And did you agree, it's a must,  
Let's call the whole thing off  
We used to had enough of us  
Let's call the whole thing off  
We used to had enough of us  
  
[Verse 3:]  
Leave me, leave me, I can't fkn stand you  
Wish I had the courage to say everything I planned to  
My girlfriend, my girlfriend, call herself my girlfriend  
Tell me that we posed to be together til the world end  
But, ion really feel that  
I just really wanna turn the wheels back  
Give you all ya sweaters and ya heels back  
Convince you that time will heal that  
Uh, you look for reasons for us to argue  
I swear everytime I call  
You jus tell me how I don't call you  
Why you do that... Do that... Do that  
Yeah  
  
[Chorus:]  
Did you agree, we should let it be  
And did you agree, it's a must,  
Let's call the whole thing off  
We used to had enough of us  
Let's call the whole thing off  
We used to had enough of us

Verse:  
(Drake)  
  
I'm Tryin To Do It All Tonight, I Got Plans  
I Got A Certain Lust For Life, And As It Stands  
Everything Is Goin' As Right, As It Can  
They Tryna Shoot Down My Flight,  
Before It Lands... Before It Lands  
  
But You Can Miss Me With All That,  
Diss Me Then Crawl Back,  
I Really Wish Ya'll Would Fall Back,  
But Gettin' Rich Suppose To Solve That,  
And These Days Women Make Offers,  
And Who The Hell Am I To Say (No, No, No),  
My Ex Send Late Night Text,  
Cause She Don't Know How To Let (Go, Go, Go),  
She In Love,  
And As For Them Pretty Light Skinned Models Standin' In The Cold,  
Aw Yah They With Us,  
Let Them Girls In For A Drink,  
And I'm All, In They Ear,  
Saying She Should Be The One I See,  
Everytime, That I'm Here,  
But When Am I Really Even Here,  
Black Surburban With The Tint On It,  
Fresher Than A Pillow With A Mint On It,  
The Game Got These Old Hand Prints On It,  
But Imma Be The One To Pour Cement On It,  
Uh, And Start Over,  
And Show Up In A Mars Yellow Tux,  
I Don't Really Give A fuck And We Only Gettin' Older,  
So What I Tend To Do, Is To Think Of Today As The Past,  
It's Funny When You're Coming In First,  
But You Hope That You Last (You Just Hope That It Lasts)  
  
Throw Your One's Up In The Air  
Throw Your One's Up In The Air For Her  
Throw Your One's Up In The Air  
Throw Your One's Up

[Hook]  
Breathe through, ride through, damn girl  
Oh man I don't know  
Pilled up filled up damn girl  
I'll be getting back to you for sure, man man  
Laced up dripped up sauced up  
Damn girl I wanna ride with you  
Waved up blowing up blowing up growing up  
Had to get it popping with you  
  
[Verse 1]  
What if I pick you up from your house  
We should get out  
We haven't talked in a while  
We should roll to see where it goes  
I saw potential in you from the go  
You know that I did  
I don't know if you know but I know who you are  
You could be big as Madonna  
Just get in the car and let's touch the road  
Don't make other plans  
Say you get up early, you work for the man  
Well he'll understand  
Pull up I'm pulling up on you in ten  
Already on ten  
Big as Madonna I'll say it again  
Soon as you get in nah nah nah  
  
[Hook]  
Breathe through, ride through, damn girl  
Oh man I don't know  
Pilled up filled up damn girl  
I'll be getting back to you for sure, man man  
Laced up dripped up sauced up  
Damn girl I wanna ride with you  
Waved up blowing up blowing up growing up  
Had to get it popping with you

Hello, yeah I just walked in, yeah I'm good you still working?  
Tonight, right now? 'Did I go out' yeah I went out, I went, I went to a couple
of clubs  
I never went to bed, shit' wine or water  
You should see someone about a cold drink, I don't know, I'm delirious' night'  
  
Cups of the Rose  
Bitches in my old phone  
I should call one and go home  
I've been in this club too long  
The woman that I would try  
Is happy wit a good guy  
But I've been drinking so much  
That I'ma call her anyway and say  
  
Fuck that nigga that you love so bad  
I know you still think about the times we had  
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found  
And since you picked up I know he's not around  
  
(Are you drunk right now?)  
  
I'm just sayin', you could do better  
Tell me have you heard that lately?  
I'm just sayin' you could do better  
And I'll start hatin', only if you make me  
  
Uh, cups of the XO  
All my people been here  
I see all of her friends here  
Guess she don't have the time to kick it no more  
Flights in the morning  
What you doing that's so important?  
I've been drinking so much  
That I'ma call you anyway and say  
  
Fuck that nigga that you love so bad  
I know you still think about the times we had  
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found  
And since you picked up I know he's not around oh  
(Are you drunk right now?)  
  
I'm just sayin', you could do better  
Tell me have you heard that lately  
I'm just sayin' you could do better  
And I'll start hatin', only if you make me  
  
I think I'm addicted to naked pictures  
And sittin' talkin' 'bout bitches  
That we almost had  
I don't think I'm conscious of making monsters  
Outta the women that I sponsor til it all goes bad  
But shit it's all good  
We threw a party, yeah we threw a party  
Bitches came over, yeah, we threw a party  
I was just calling cause they were just leaving  
Talk to me please, don't have much to believe in  
I need you right now, are you down to listen to me?  
Too many drinks have been given to me  
I got some women that's living off me  
Paid for their flights and hotels I'm ashamed  
Bet that you know them, I won't say no names  
After a while girl they all seem the same  
I've had sex four times this week I'll explain  
Having a hard time adjusting to fame  
Sprite in that mixture, I've been talking crazy girl  
I'm lucky that you picked up  
Lucky that you stayed on  
I need someone to put this weight on  
  
"Well I'm sorry"  
"Are you drunk right now?"  
  
I'm just sayin', you could do better  
Tell me have you heard that lately  
I'm just sayin' you could do better  
And I'll start hatin', only if you make me  
  
"You're not going to come?"  
"Guess I'm bout to just kick it here then"  
  
Just throw up while I hold your hair back  
Her white friend said "you niggas crazy"  
I hope no-one heard that  
I hope no-one heard that  
Cause if they did, we gon be in some trouble

I am on that 24 hour  
Champagne diet spillin while I'm sippin  
I encourage you to try it  
I'm probably just saying that cause I don't have to buy it  
The club owner supply it  
Boy I'm on that fly shit  
I am, what everybody in my past don't want me to be  
Guess what, I made it  
I'm the mother fucking man  
I just want you to see  
Come take a look, get a load of this nigga  
Quit fronting on me  
Don't come around and try to gas me up I like runnin on E  
I I I I'm on my disneyg shit  
Goofy flow on records I'm Captin Hook  
And my new car is Rupio  
Damn where my roof just go  
I'm somebody that you should know  
Get to shaking something cause that's what Drama produced it fo'  
Yes I make mistakes that I don't ever make excuses for  
Leaving girls that love me and constantly seducing hoes  
I'm losing my thoughts I said damn where my roof just go  
Top slipped off like Janet at the Super Bowl  
  
I got 'em  
He can't, they can't, and I can't blame 'em  
Since I got famous bitch, I got money to blow  
Gettin it in, letting these bills fall  
All over your skin  
Got money to blow oh oh oh oh oh oh

I love you so much!  
But I hate what you've done  
I know from here things will never be the same  
And things will probably never change  
I know what we want  
Isn't exactly what god had planned  
Hey it's all I can do is  
Hope you can see the difference  
And prey for the best  
Please don't forget me!  
  
I wont soothe your pain  
I wont ease your strength  
  
Drake:  
I should let you fall in love with  
Someone else girl  
I live in L. A  
You in Chicago  
You're not patient  
I'm not patient  
We shouldn't be together  
I think we shouldn't be together  
No more no (no more no)  
Just think I'm where it all beginning  
You're the envy of your prince  
Plus you know you're not yourself any more  
The miracle of change  
But if we got together it will never be the same like before girl  
And I'm sorry  
I said I'm sorry girl  
(Yeah)  
She said look me in my fucking eyes and say it  
But tell me am I wrong for what I'm saying  
  
Is it wrong for me to tell these women what they wanna hear  
Try to control us  
You wanna hold us down  
Yeah you really wanna hold us down  
Yeah you really wanna hold us  
  
All I asked is for a chance to prove that money can't really make me happy  
Crazy how I blew myself from fucked up predicaments  
I mean women inspire me to great things  
(Drake:?)  
I need to grow some fucking confidence  
And why you gotta say the last words  
And if I tell you how I really felt  
(There probably end up being another argument candy girl,  
You know everything you thought of me came from yourself)  
Yeah  
And that shit starts to get old  
And I don't mean to say the most  
But you know how they say you are who you hang with?  
So it bothers me when you hang with hoes  
  
Drake:  
Is it wrong for me to tell these women what they wanna hear  
  
You know how they say  
If you love somebody  
That don't love you back  
Love them anyway

We both wake up, staring at the sky  
Don't remember how we got here but we don't wonder why  
Right now we living life like there's no way we can die  
But we bout to do our thing they couldn't stop us if they try  
Keep the weapon for the haters if they try to blow our high  
How the fuck would they stop us if we by each other's side  
We were meant to be together we get inside  
How the hell would they kill us when we're feeling so alive  
  
Ooh girl I know you want a G  
It's kinda hard not to notice me  
Cause I'm right here where you wanna be  
I can take you where you wanna go, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  
  
Baby I can give what you want and everything you need  
Put us both in a position where we can both succeed  
And if it takes a sacrifice I promise I will bleed  
All the blessings that I get I promise you'll receive  
Fuck them other niggas all they do is deceive  
Let me take away your pain, my job is to relieve  
  
Ooh girl I know you want a G  
It's kinda hard not to notice me  
Cause I'm right here where you wanna be  
I can take you where you wanna go, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

It's the ones that smoke blunts with ya, seen ya picture  
Now they wanna grab a gun and come and getcha  
It's the ones that smoke blunts with ya, seen ya picture  
Now they wanna grab a gun and come and getcha  
One time for the homie dj screw  
Already I'm feelin' throwed in this bitch  
  
I'm so high even when I'm comin' down  
Just met a girl, said she from the H-Town  
I said my name is Drizzy and ain't nobody realer  
A cup inside a cup smokin' ghost face killah  
Got these boppers goin' crazy  
  
Nigga, I'm the man, I sent your girl message  
Said I see you when I can  
She send me one back but I ain't never read it  
'Cause pussies only pussy and I get it when I need it and  
  
I'm tellin' you when homies runnin' down in the winter  
And I be riding rims with tires in it thinner  
Air force stun fly charters over seas full of Don Perian  
And the water for the D's  
  
Don't know why it happens every time we alone  
But here we are again and I swear I'm in my zone  
So I'ma sip this drink till that motherfucker gone  
Than you go get undressed and we gon' get it on  
  
I don't give you the time you deserve from me  
This is something I know, I know, I know  
So tonight I'll just fuck you like we're in Houston  
Taking everything slow so slow, so slow but I do it to her  
  
Draped up and dripped out know what I'm talkin' 'bout  
Three in the morning get it poppin' in the parking lot  
It's on once again and I never pretend  
A nigga stay G till the end, yeah  
  
I swear like every time we find ourself in this situation  
I just get that feeling like I mean Houston candy paint  
Switching colors in the light, it's about like 11 P. M.  
And you just roaming through the city bumpin' that screw  
  
Big Mo, ugk, Lil Keke  
It feel like everything just moving slow  
Let's take my time, I pace it, baby  
Yeah, I'm gone

[Intro: Kyla]  
Baby I like your style  
  
[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]  
Lips on your neck  
We're never too close now  
Nothing like you and me  
I don't know your name  
But I'm sure that you know me  
A little life with the music  
The feeling is mutual  
Loving the way you move on me  
Skin so soft, hands on my face to be directed  
And you're all that I can see  
You give the baddest one in here a run for their money  
And when this song comes on, you know  
  
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]  
I need a one dance  
1942 in my hand  
One more time 'fore I go  
Body lockin', put a hold on me  
I need a one dance  
1942 in my hand  
One more time 'fore I go  
Body lockin', put a hold on me  
  
[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]  
You know, I like that you're wild  
So make your way over here right now  
We only got a little while  
Just thinkin' out loud  
Celebrate life with me babe  
Don't be in a rush to go now  
Oh girl  
  
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]  
I need a one dance  
1942 in my hand  
One more time 'fore I go  
Body lockin', put a hold on me  
I need a one dance  
1942 in my hand  
One more time 'fore I go  
Body lockin', put a hold on me  
  
[Outro: Justin Bieber]  
Hold on me  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
One more dance is all I need  
One more dance is all I need  
Oh, oh, oh

I know way too many people here right now  
That I didn't know last year, who the fuck are y'all?  
I swear it feels like the last few nights  
We been everywhere and back  
But I just can't remember it all  
  
What am I doin'? What am I doin'?  
Oh, yeah, that's right, I'm doin' me  
I'm doin' me  
I'm livin' life right now, mayne  
  
And this what I'm a do 'til it's over  
'Til it's over  
But it's far from over  
  
Bottles on me, long as someone drink it  
Never drop the ball, fuck are y'all thinkin'?  
Makin' sure the Young Money ship is never sinkin'  
'Bout to set it off, in this bitch, Jada Pinkett  
I shouldn't've drove, tell me how I'm gettin' home  
You too fine to be layin' down in bed alone  
I could teach you how to speak my language, Rosetta Stone  
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known  
'Bout to go Thriller Mike Jackson on these niggas  
All I need's a fucking red jacket with some zippers  
Super good smiddoke, a package of the swishers  
I did it overnight, it couldn't happen any quicker  
Y'all know them? Well, fuck it, me either  
But point the biggest skeptic out, I'll make him a believer  
It wouldn't be the first time I done it, throwin' hundreds  
When I should be throwin' ones, bitch, I run it (Ah)  
  
I know way too many people here right now  
That I didn't know last year, who the fuck are y'all?  
I swear it feels like the last few nights  
We been everywhere and back  
But I just can't remember it all  
  
What am I doin'? What am I doin'?  
Oh, yeah, that's right, I'm doin' me  
I'm doin' me  
I'm livin' life right now, mayne  
  
And this what I'm a do 'til it's over  
'Til it's over  
But it's far from over  
  
One thing 'bout music, when it hits you feel no pain  
And I swear I got that shit that make these bitches go insane  
So they tell me that they love me, I know better than that, it's just game  
It's just what comes with the fame, and I'm ready for that, I'm just sayin'  
But I really can't complain, everything is kosher  
Two thumbs up, Ebert and Roeper  
I really can't see the end getting any closer  
But I probly still be the man when everything is over  
So I'm riding through the city with my high beams on  
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on  
Y'all just do not fit the picture, turn your widescreen on  
If you thinkin' I'm a quit before I die, dream on  
Man, they treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?  
I'm really too young to be feelin' this old  
It's about time you admit it, who you kiddin', man?  
Man, nobody's never done it like I did it (Ugh)  
  
I know way too many people here right now  
That I didn't know last year, who the fuck are y'all?  
I swear it feels like the last few nights  
We been everywhere and back  
But I just can't remember it all  
  
What am I doin'? What am I doin'?  
Oh, yeah, that's right, I'm doin' me  
I'm doin me  
I'm livin' life right now, mayne  
  
And this what I'm a do 'til it's over  
'Til it's over  
But it's far from over  
Yeah, that's right, I'm doin' me  
I'm doin me  
I'm livin' life right now, mayne  
  
And this what I'm a do 'til it's over  
'Til it's over  
But it's far from over

How I'm feeling, it doesn't matter  
'Cause you know I'm okay  
Instead, I ask myself "why do you hurt me?"  
When you know, you know I'm the same  
I know, I know that you love me baby  
They're trying to take you away from me  
Only over my dead body  
  
I think I killed everybody in the game last year, man fuck it I was on though  
And I thought I found the girl of my dreams at a strip club, mm  
Fuck it I was wrong though  
Shout out all to all my niggas living tax free  
Nowadays its six figures when they tax me  
Oh well, I guess you lose some and win some  
Long as the outcome is income  
You know I want it all and then some  
Shout out to Asian girls, let the lights dim sum  
Shots came, I don't know where they was sent from  
Probably some bad hoes about to take the hemp from  
Yeah, you know me well nigga  
Yeah, I mean you ain't the only real nigga  
They got me on these white women like Seal nigga  
Slave to the pussy but I'm just playing the field nigga, yeah  
Are these people really discussing my career again?  
Asking if I'll be going platinum in a year again  
Don't I got the shit the world wanna hear again?  
Don't Michael Jordan still got his hoop earing in?  
Man all of your flows bore me, paint drying  
And I don't ever be trippin' off of what ain't mine  
And I be hearing the shit you say through the grapevine  
But jealousy is just love and hate at the same time  
It's been that way from the beginning  
I just been playing, I ain't even know that I was winning  
And this is the only sound you should fear  
Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is alright  
  
[Chorus]  
I know, I know that you love me baby  
They're trying to take you away from me  
Only over my dead body  
  
You say I'm old news, well who the new star?  
'Cause if I'm going anywhere, it's probably too far  
Just performed at a Bar Mitzvah over in the States  
Used half of the money to beat my brother's case  
Red wine over Fed time  
But shout out to the niggas that's doing dead time  
And shout out to the bitches there when it's bedtime  
And fuck you to the niggas that think it's their time  
Yeah, don't make me take your life apart boy  
You and whoever the fuck gave you your start boy  
Or you wanna be a muthafuckin' funny guy?  
Don't make me break your Kevin heart boy  
Yeah, it's whatever. You know, feeling good, living better  
I think maybe I was numb to it last year  
But you know I feel it now more than ever  
My city love me like Mac Dre in the Bay  
Second album, I'm back paving the way  
The backpackers are back on the bandwagon  
Like this was my comeback season back, back in the day  
And I met your baby moms last night  
We took a picture together, I hope she frames it!  
And I was drinking at the Palms last night  
And ended up losing everything that I came with  
Feel like I've been here before huh?  
I still got ten years to go huh?  
And this is the only sound you should fear  
These kids wear crowns over here  
And everything is all right  
  
[Chorus]

Own It  
It's yours  
  
Yours  
You're still the one that I adore  
Ain't much out there to have feelings for  
Guess who's it is? Guess who's it is?  
Guess who's it is? Guess who's it is?  
Yours  
A few bottles on the table, a few waters  
It ain't a secret, baby, everybody saw us  
Guess who's it is? Guess who's it is?  
Guess who's it is?  
It's yours  
  
Next time we fuck, I don't want to fuck, I want to make love  
Next time we talk, I don't want to just talk, I want to trust  
Next time I stand tall I want to be standing for you  
And next time I spend I want it all to be for you  
Peaking, I'm peaking, wake up with me this weekend, weekend  
Guess who's it is?  
Guess who's it is? Guess who's it is?  
It's yours  
  
Own it  
I said go own that shit  
Own that shit, own that shit  
Own that shit, go own that shit  
Own that shit, own that shit  
Own that shit, own that shit  
Go own that shit  
  
Own it  
I said go own that shit  
Own that shit, own that shit  
Own that shit, go own that shit  
Own that shit, own that shit  
Own that shit, own that shit  
Go own that shit  
  
Niggas talk more than bitches these days  
Just let that shit sink in  
Niggas talk more than bitches these days  
Who could get the pussy quicker these days  
Still straight with the weed and the liquor these days  
Cause the new drugs got the kids trippin' these days  
Bunch of journalists been searchin' for a story  
My ex-girl been searchin' for a "sorry"  
Couple bitches tryin' to have me on the Maury like nigga it's yours  
You should be supportin' but where you been at? On tour, gettin' money  
Y'all don't even really check for me  
You ain't even hit me when that nigga had threats for me  
Girl, you don't love me, you just say that shit to get to me  
Girl, cause you got the Batphone in my workline  
You should call it  
When the last time you did something for the first time?  
You have done it all, swear to God  
Niggas talk more than bitches these days  
Got you thinkin' I'm different these days  
Broken telephone for every single conversation  
By the time it gets to you, shit switches these days  
It's yours, it's your, it's yours, it's always gonna be yours  
  
Own it  
It's yours, yeah  
It's yours, own it  
Own It  
Own It  
Own It  
Own It  
Baby, own it  
It's yours  
Own that shit, own that shit  
Own that shit

Intro:  
  
Would've came back for you  
I just needed time  
To do what I had to do  
Caught in the life  
I can't let it go  
Whether that's right  
I wont ever know  
  
Hope you forgive me  
Never meant wrong  
Tried to be patient  
It waited to long  
But I would've came back  
But I would've came back for you  
Would've came back  
Would've came back...  
  
Verse 1:  
  
I talk, slicker, than a, pimp from Augusta  
Who just had his linen suit dry cleaned  
Bitches what's up witcha  
I hate callin' the women butches, but the bitches love it  
I took some sence and made a nickle of it  
I'm urgin' all daughters to kiss they mothers  
With those lips that all that lipstick covers  
You're never too groen up to miss and hug her  
And girls countin' on me to be there like missin' rubers  
I'm on some Marvin Gaye shit, a bunch of distant lovers  
This ain't the life that I'm used to  
Re-introduced to people I've been intoduced to  
Did you forget me?  
Or are you took scared to tell me that you met me and fear that I wont  
Remember  
I wish you could still accept me for me  
I miss Memphis, Tennessee, my cousins, my dad  
The simplistic beauty that all them southerners had  
I'm half way across the world with dozens of bags  
Feelin' like all four members of Color Me Badd  
In one nigga, amazin' shit  
I got that Courtney Love for ya, that crazy shit  
Ion drink every bottle I own  
I be agin' shit  
And I got them wedding ring flows that engaging shit  
Which one of y'all got fleets on your key chains  
The seats to these Heat games  
I think that you stare at yourself and you see things  
La familia, I've been inducted and instucted  
To stunt on these niggas we don't really fuck with  
Fuck is up?  
Havin' lunch and debatin' Ferrari prices  
23 and goin' through a mid-life crisis  
But tust me I still deliver like a mid-wife  
And no I'm not syin' I'm the nicest  
I just live life like it  
Uh, It a certain type of man to teach  
To be far from hood  
But to understand the streets  
I never threw away that paper with my grammy speech  
Because I haven't hit the pinnacles I plan to reach  
Yeah, You gotta own it if you want it  
Kisses her on the body  
She tells me live in the moment  
And baby I never forget none of that  
Girl I told you I was comin' back  
  
Chorus:  
  
Would've came back for you  
I just needed time  
To do what I had to do  
Caught in the life  
I can't let it go  
Whether that's right  
I wont ever know  
  
Hope you forgive me  
Never meant wrong  
Tried to be patient  
It waited to long  
But I would've came back  
But I would've came back for you  
Would've came back  
Would've came back

Every second, every minute, man I swear that she can get it  
Say if you a bad bitch put your hands up high, hands up high, hands up high  
Tell 'em dim the lights down right now, put me in the mood  
I'm talking 'bout dark room, perfume  
Go, go!  
  
I recognize your fragrance (hol' up!)  
You ain't never gotta say (woo!)  
And I know your taste is  
A little bit (mmm) high maintenance (ooh)  
Everybody else basic  
You live life on an everyday basis  
With poetic justice, poetic justice  
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?  
I mean I write poems in these songs dedicated to you  
When you're in the mood for empathy, theres blood in my pen  
Better yet where your friends and them?  
I really wanna know you all  
I really wanna show you off  
Fuck that, pour up plenty of champagne  
Cold nights when you this name  
You called up your girlfriends and  
Y'all curled in that little bitty Range I heard that  
She wanna go and party, she wanna go and party  
don't approach her with that Atari  
that ain't good game, homie, sorry  
They say conversation, rule a nation, I can tell  
But I could never right my wrongs  
'less I write it down for real, P.S  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
You can get it, you can get it  
You can get it, you can get it  
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want  
Poetic justice, put it in a song  
  
I really hope you play this  
'Cause ol' girl you test my patience  
With all these s photographs and all these one off vacations  
You've been taken  
Clearly a lot for me to take in  
It don't make sense  
Young East African Girl, you too busy with your other man  
I was trying to put you on game, put you on a plane  
Take you and your mama to the motherland  
I could do it, maybe one day  
When you figure out you're gonna need someone  
When you figure out it's all right here in the city  
And you don't run from where we come from  
That sound like poetic justice, poetic justice  
You were so new to this life but God you got adjusted  
I mean I write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun  
Your natural hair and your soft skin, and your big in that sundress (ooh  
Good God, what you doing that walk for?  
When I see that thing move, I just wish we would fight less  
And we would talk more  
And they say communication save relations, I can tell  
But I can never right my wrongs unless I write them down for real  
P.S  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Every time I write these words they become a taboo  
Making sure my punctuation curve, every letter is true  
Living my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof  
I'm talking poetic justice, poetic justice  
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?  
I mean you need to hear this  
Love is not just a verb, it's you looking in the mirror  
Love is not just a verb, it's you looking for a maybe  
Call me crazy, We can both be insane  
A fatal attraction is common  
And what we have common is pain  
I mean you need to hear this  
Love is not just a verb and I can see power steering  
drive when you swerve, I want that interference  
It's coherent, I can hear it, mmhmm  
That's your heartbeat  
It either caught me or it called me, mmhmm  
Breathe slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines  
Sincerely, yours truly  
And right before you go blind  
P.S  
  
[Chorus]

Cash money shit, cash money shit  
  
I can tell that money's got you working  
We've been talking for so long  
Now we're finally here in person  
I taste pain and regret, in your sweat  
You've been waiting for me, oh ho  
I can tell that you been practicing  
I can tell that you been practicing  
All those other men were practice, they were practice  
Yeah, for me, for me, for me, for me  
  
Girl you look good won't you back that ass up

You working with some ass yeah, you bad yeah  
Girl you working with some ass yeah, you bad yeah  
  
Girl you working with some ass yeah, you bad yeah  
Make a nigga spend his cash yeah, his last yeah  
Hoes frown when you pass yeah, they mad yeah  
Couple thousand on your bag yeah, fuck yeah  
I'm a big timer nigger yeah, money flipper yeah  
Get it understood yeah, it's all good yeah  
Girl I know it's real cause I've been around it  
You only want what's real you just never found it  
Don't give them no more chances, ooh girl they had their turn  
Everything for a reason, there's things you had to learn from them  
But when I get you to myself  
You know what's going down, what's going down  
  
Girl you look good won't you back that ass up  
You a fine motherfucker won't you back that ass up  
Call me Big Daddy won't you back that ass up  
Girl who is you playing with, back that ass up  
You working with some ass yeah, you bad yeah  
Girl you working with some ass yeah, you bad yeah  
  
I know he messed up  
But let a real nigger make it right  
Let a real nigger make it right, you deserve that much  
Let me put something in your life  
Let me put something in your life, put something in your life  
You telling me it's only been a couple other people that you've been with  
I'ma trust you I'ma give you the benefit of the doubt, and I'ma love you

Got your body so wet  
Now we're finally here in person  
I taste pain and regret, In your sweat  
You've been waiting for me, oh ho  
I can tell that you been practicing  
I can tell that you been practicing  
All those other men were practice, they were practice  
Yeah, for me, for me, for me, for me

[Intro]  
Yeah, I get it  
I get it  
Yeah  
  
[Verse 1]  
Why would I say all these things to have you feelin' a way?  
Why would I tell you I'm 30 away if I'm not on the way?  
Why do I settle for women that force me to pick up the pieces?  
Why do I want an independent woman to feel like she needs me?  
I lost my way  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm searchin' for these words to say to you  
Please give me time  
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you  
Oh please give me time  
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now  
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me  
Yeah  
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me  
Yeah  
  
[Verse 2]  
Run your mouth, I'd rather listen to someone else  
I gave your nickname to someone else  
I know you're seein' someone that loves you  
And I don't want you to see no one else  
I don't want you here with no one else  
I don't wanna do this with no one else  
I used to know you back when you was young  
Your brother brought me through, you saw me  
That made me think of you so differently  
I miss the feeling of you missing me  
But you say you're over and done with me  
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah  
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
Now redemption's on your mind when you think about me  
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah  
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me  
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah  
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me  
Aw, please give me time  
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now, yeah  
  
[Verse 3]  
Say to you  
But 80 percent of it was the truth, yeah  
Say to you  
A Mercedes coupe that you're still drivin' was for me and you  
Girl, really gon' spend the winter with this other nigga?  
Act like he's really the one to get through it with you  
Clicked up with Jessica, Kim, you know that I'm bound to see you  
And they both say that you're over and done with me  
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah  
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
They say redemption's on your mind when you think about me  
Yeah, aww yeah, yeah, yeah  
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me  
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah  
Redemption's on your mind when you  
Aw please give me time  
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now  
  
[Verse 4]  
Damn, I'm not unrealistic with none of my women  
I tell them if they ain't with it then let's just forget it  
Relationships slowin' me down, they slow down the vision  
Guess I'm not in a position to deal with commitment  
Certain people need to tell me they're proud of me  
That mean a lot to me  
Not havin' closure, it take a lot out of me  
This year for Christmas I just want apologies  
Sydney gave up on me when I went missin'  
Syn had a baby and treated me different  
Erika sued me and opened a business  
Wonder if they wish it could've been different  
Wonder what they'd do put in my position  
I wonder, when my shit drop, do they listen?  
Wonder if they're second guessin' their decisions  
I hate the number 2, that shit is unforgiven  
Tryna satisfy everybody  
It's like they can't get enough  
Until enough is enough  
And then it's too much  
You tip the scale when I weigh my options  
West Palm girls are spoiled rotten  
Tiffany on you, you know you poppin'  
I'll kill somebody if they give you problems  
Master bedroom's where we get it poppin'  
Just ignore all the skeletons in my closet  
I'm a walkin' come-up, I'm a bank deposit  
Sell my secrets and get top dollar  
Sell my secrets for a Range Rover  
Opportunity and temptation  
They would sell my secrets for a tropical vacation  
Sell my secrets back to me if I was payin'  
Who's gonna save me when I need savin'?  
Since Take Care, I've been caretakin'  
But second chances, that ain't how you livin'  
Redemption on your mind, I'll never be forgiven  
  
[Outro]  
Yeah  
I know

[Verse:]  
Can I, can I save you from you?  
Cause you know there's something missing  
And that champagne you've been sippin's not supposed to make you different all
the time  
It's starting to feel like the wrong thing to do, yeah  
Cause with all that recognition it gets hard for you to listen  
To the things that I must say to make you mine  
But live girl, have some fun girl, we'll be fine  
Trying to convince myself I've found one  
Making a mistake I never learned from  
  
[Hook:]  
I swear I always fall for your type, yeah, for your type  
Tell me why I always fall for your type, for your type  
I just can't explain this shit at all  
I just can't explain this shit at all  
I just can't explain this shit at all  
I just can't explain this shit at all  
I believe in people like you  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Cause who am I to judge you on the past, girl  
I bet there's a reason for it all  
You say that you're nothing like the last girl  
I just pray that you don't let me down right now  
But it's too late, cause I'm already yours  
You just gotta promise me, hearts won't break  
And end up like before  
  
[Hook:]  
  
[Verse 3:]  
Look, dress hanging off your shoulder, barely sober  
Telling me how you moving away and starting over  
Girl, quit playing you just drunk. You just saying shit  
Oh you dance, dance like how, like ballet and shit  
Oh, wait... No, I get it girl, I'm with it  
I've been down this road before and yeah I skidded but forget it  
Damn, I wonder why I never why I learned my lesson  
It's feeling like the second chance and it's the first impression  
And I heard it's nothing new except for someone new  
But how you supposed to find the one when anyone will come with you  
Talking to myself but I never listen  
Cause man it's been a while, and I swear that this ones different  
That's why I'mma take you anywhere you wanna go  
Let you meet my friends so they can lecture me again about  
How reckless I have been  
And I'm slowly running out of all the time that I invest in  
Making all the same mistakes  
And I swear I'm just trying to correct it  
And I fall...  
  
[Hook:]

I can see it in your eyes, you're angry  
Regret got shit on what you're feeling now  
Mad cause he ain't like me  
Oh you mad cause nobody ever did it like me  
All the care I would take, all the love that we made  
Now you're trying to find somebody to replace what I gave to you  
It's a shame you didn't keep it, Alicia, Katia  
I know that you gon' hear this, I'm the man  
Yeah I said it, bitch I'm the man  
Don't you forget it  
The way you walk, that's me  
The way you talk, that's me  
The way you've got your hair up, did you forget that's me?  
And the voice in your speaker right now, that's me  
And the voice in your ear, that's me  
Can't you see that I made it? Yeah I made it  
First I made you who you are, then I made it  
And you're wasted with your ladies  
Yeah I'm the reason why you always getting faded  
  
[Chorus]  
Take a shot for me, ooh  
Take a shot for me, ooh  
Take a shot for me  
A shot for me  
A shot for me  
  
Okay look, I'm honest  
Girl I can't lie, I miss you  
You and the music were the only things that I commit to  
I never cheated, for the record, back when I was with you  
But you believe in everything but me girl, I don't get you  
She says I know you changed, I never see you  
Cause you're always busy doing things  
I really wish she had a different way of viewing things  
I think the city that we're from just kinda ruined things  
It's such a small place, not much to do but talk and listen  
The men are jealous and the women all in competition  
And now your friends telling you stories that you often misinterpret  
And taint all the images of your "Mr. Perfect"  
I could tell that you been crying all night, drinking all summer  
Praying for your happiness, hope that you recover  
This is one I know you hated when you heard it  
And it's worse because you know that I deserve it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
May your neighbors respect you  
Trouble neglect you, angels protect you  
And heaven accept you

[Chorus]  
How did I end up right here with you  
After all the things that I been through  
Its been one of those days  
You tryin' forget about  
Take a shot and let it out  
Let's get right  
Now that I'm here baby  
Show me a good time  
(oh yeah, oh yeah)  
Show me a good time  
(oh yeah, oh yeah)  
Show me a good  
Show me a good  
Show me a good time  
(oh yeah, oh yeah)  
  
I live for the nights that I can't remember,  
With the people that I won't forget  
Spending all the money I just work my ass off  
For the things that I won't regret  
I've been waiting way too long long long long  
Tellin' everybody that I know we about to be on on on on  
I ain't tryin' look like I lie to these niggas that I came up with  
That's my team, never would I let a woman come between  
What we doing right now  
This our dream, Wu Tang Clan niggas want that cream  
I'm the Osirus of the shit right now  
Go to god for the hits right now  
Whatever you wanna drink girl pick right now  
If you can't hold your liquor you better quit right now  
  
[Chorus]  
  
How 'bout you and all your morals and that outfit that you borrowed  
Make the most out of tonight and worry 'bout it all tomorrow  
Understand girl, we fam' girl  
Can't get me right and not do Wayne  
Cash money young money pop champagne  
Presidential suite girl Barrack Hussain  
Tell me can we kick it like Ali Shaheed and Phife Dawg  
People really hate when a backpack rapper get rich  
And start livin' that life dawg  
Feels like when you gettin' to that paper hip hop hates ya  
They would do it just like I do if they could  
Its in our nature  
Ah, young and rich and out of control  
Out in LA blowing clouds of that killer  
I came up in the underground though  
So I'm a spend another ten thousand for Dilla  
Call me over-rated or created or too jaded  
Because any way you put it bitch I made it, yup!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Show me a good time  
(oh yeah, oh yeah)  
Show me a good time  
(oh yeah, oh yeah)  
Show me a good  
Show me a good  
Show me a good time  
(oh yeah, oh yeah)

[Drake]  
Side pieces  
I know that you're watching this from home  
I can't wait to see you on the road  
Cheering from the shadows I hear you calling out  
Wifey sees a text and asks what's this all about  
I tell her you're just a friend  
A lot of these guys are dying for this song to end  
I'm asking would you be mine  
Would you get on this flight to Cleveland, Ohio at 2:45  
I had a rough game I took two shots I was 0 for 2  
Tough day I need that one thing only you can do  
Skylar this is the one thing that I'd be for you  
This goes out to all my side pieces  
Side pieces, side pieces  
This goes out to all my side pieces  
You know that you'll never be the main one  
City to city I see you wearing the same one  
Side pieces, side pieces  
Los Angeles I want you to make some noise for the real king of side pieces
Brian McKnight one time  
  
[Brian McKnight]  
This is dedicated to all the side pieces  
I know you'll never be more  
And you'll always be less  
But there's courage in knowing that you're ok being shit  
I already got a starter but I'm looking for the rest of my team  
Side pieces in training go on and wave your hands for Drake and me  
(Don't be embarrassed)  
Side pieces where you at  
(Probably in the top balcony)  
I know you're not down here in front of us you got to be way back in the back  
(They can't even see us)  
Side pieces go on and be, side pieces ya  
Side pieces

Third take

I told you that I'm in it for the long haul  
You can really get to business

Rolling swishers hittin' swishers  
Got me feelin' like a ball hog  
I don't pass 'em when I get it  
I'll admit it, I'll admit it  
You too worried 'bout the bitches  
I got one girl, and she my girl, and nobody else can hit it  
She'll admit it, she'll admit it  
She ain't fuckin' with you niggas  
And just like ever single other thing in my life  
You can have her when I'm finished

Shit hot up in the 6 now shit hot up in the 6 boy

I give a fuck about your mob boy  
I'm the real 6 God boy

You was poppin' back when Usher wore a you-chain

It's a ovo come through murk thing  
I know you heard things  
Bitch I know you heard things  
Yeah, I know you heard things

Coming from the motherfucking 6 side  
I'm not new to this  
Niggas wouldn't make it on this side  
I'm not new to this  
I'm not new, I'm not new  
Yeah, I know you heard things  
Nobody likes us except for us  
Yeah, all I ever needed was the squad so that's what's up  
Yeah, my sound got the whole city a way right now now  
So I don't give a fuck about what anybody sayin' right now

[Verse 1:]  
Hey girl,  
Do you want my number?  
That way you can call me  
Everytime I come into town  
And then I will drive up to your house  
And take you out to dinner  
I don't expect nothing at all  
  
[Chorus:]  
But what if we happen to kiss, then we touch  
Put a rush on it, get it over with  
What if I just know what you like  
And it feels right, then it's over with  
What if I don't call you back  
Prove you right  
And all this lasts just one night  
(Maybe we should slow it down) slow, slow, slow  
  
[Verse 2: Drake]  
Hey girl,  
I'm back in Atlanta  
Second dates are lovely  
This time you should choose where we go  
Need suggestions?  
How about the movies?  
Mini golf or ice cream  
I'm not picky, you'll let me know  
  
[Chorus:]  
But what if we happen to kiss, then we touch  
Put a rush on it, get it over with  
What if I just know what you like  
And it feels right, then it's over with  
What if I don't call you back  
Prove you right  
And all this lasts just one night  
(Maybe we should slow it down) slow, slow, slow  
  
[Chorus:]  
But what if we happen to kiss, then we touch  
Put a rush on it, get it over with  
What if I just know what you like  
And it feels right, then it's over with  
What if I don't call you back  
Prove you right  
And all this lasts just one night  
(Maybe we should slow it down) slow, slow, slow  
  
Maybe we should slow it down  
If you're ready,  
We can go all the way.  
We can go all the way..

[Verse 1: Drake]  
This is all God's doing man you can't plan it  
But if the devil's in the details then I'm satanic  
Bout to take over your city and you can't stand it  
My accountant say you sinking like the Titanic  
David Blaine last summer man you had to vanish  
I get the hits like somebody pitching underhanded  
Got my Spanish ting convinced that I know Spanish  
Really when she get to talking I don't understand it  
You ain't own it right away, you had to wait on niggas  
Man I'm only 29 have some patience with us  
Plus I never met nobody from my label nigga  
I just pop up with the music then they pay a nigga  
Shit ain't been the same like before  
I still love it but I used to love it more  
Face time with my shawty on tour  
And she texting purple hearts cause she know that we at war, yeah  
  
[Hook: Drake]  
Niggas keep reaching and dissin'  
Can't afford mistakes, not on this end  
Make me call my bros for assistance  
You gon make me call my bros for assistance  
Niggas keep reaching and dissin'  
Put me in a fucked up position  
You gon make me call my bros, for assistance  
Make me call my bro  
[Verse 2: 21 Savage]  
Baby I'm a savage I ain't romantic  
When I come around these rappers niggas start to panic  
And they pockets going under like the Titanic  
Got some head last night and it was outstanding'  
They was hatin' on me then and they hatin' now  
She was playing with me then but she waitin' now  
Used to sleep inside a den I got acres now  
I was fighting niggas then but I'm spraying now (blasting)  
I don't pay no mind to no sneak diss  
I won't spend a dime on a freak bitch  
Niggas takin' cheap shots on some cheap shit  
They the type to stand in line for some free shit  
Babygirl gon suck it 'till her jaws locked  
She gon' make me put my bitch on call block  
We the ones poppin', we the ones shoppin'  
We the one droppin', niggas we the ones  
They the ones duckin' when them heaters come  
You that nigga snitchin' on your people huh  
21 savage aka the reaper huh  
Pussy niggas gettin' shot for all that reachin' huh  
  
[Hook: Drake]  
Niggas keep reaching and dissin'

[Verse 3: Drake]  
I don't need love I'm the G.O.A.T  
I just hit the beat and float  
And I'm selling out arenas, but you putting on a show  
I been tryna change life around for everyone I know  
Cause if I don't share the wealth  
Then how the fuck we supposed to grow  
Mom's stressed theres a lot of things we need  
Chain smoking in the house it's hard to breathe  
I used to have to hit my T's with Febreeze  
Jordan pull up in the TL now I'm cheese  
I'mma turn this TSX to a Benz soon  
I'mma see a lot of blessings for my friends soon  
150 inch screen in my bedroom  
6'1" man that nigga need some leg room  
Shit ain't been the same like before  
They ain't even wanna look up at the score  
Face time with my shawty on tour  
And she texting purple hearts cause she know that we at war  
  
[Hook: Drake]  
Niggas keep reaching and dissin'  
Can't afford mistakes, not on this end  
Make me call my bros for assistance  
You gon make me call my bros for assistance  
Niggas keep reaching and dissin'  
Put me in all fucked up position  
Make me call my bros, for assistance  
Make me call my bro

Falling too fast  
Clearly rules don't apply  
Can't believe that I just met you  
You got me here  
Watching minutes past by  
Wondering when to expect you  
There you go  
Is this a dream  
Looking like every picture  
That I've seen of you before  
I've seen it all before  
Now that it's over. I shoulda known better  
  
Then you think this is real and  
You could be mine  
I should have known better  
Slowed it down cause I feel  
You needed time  
  
But I kept thinking  
This could be something  
This could be something  
This could be something  
This could be  
This could be  
This could be something  
This could be something  
This could be something  
  
Maybe it's just nothing at all  
But this could be something  
This could be something  
This could be  
This could be  
This could be something  
This could be something  
This could be something  
  
Maybe it's just nothing at all  
At all... At all...  
Maybe it's just nothing at all  
At all... At all...  
  
I guess it's what we make it  
  
I guess it's what we make it  
  
I guess it's what we...

Verse 1:(Drake)  
  
I Forgot To Call You On Your Birthday,  
You Swear You're The Last Thing On My Mind,  
There Is Nothin' I Can Do To Fix It,  
(All You Ever Asked Me For Was Time)  
When The Lights Don't Glow The Same Way That They Used To,  
And I Finally Get A Moment To Myself,  
I Will Realize You Were Everything I'm Missing,  
And You'll Tell Me You're In Love With Someone Else  
  
Chorus:(Drake)  
  
So Can You Do Me A Favor, If I Pull It Together,  
Make It Sooner Than Later,  
We Won't Be Here Forever, And I Realized I Waited Too Long,  
But Please Don't Move On,  
You Don't Need No One Else  
You Don't Need No One El-El-El-El-Else  
You Don't Need No One Else  
You Don't Need No One El-El-El-El Oh Ho Ho  
You Don't Need No One Else  
  
Verse 2:(Drake)  
  
You Just Changed Your Hair And It Looks Perfect,  
Wish I Was The First To Let You Know,  
Every Chance I Get To Make It Better,  
I Just Find A Way To Let It Go,  
When The Lights Don't Glow The Same Way That They Used To,  
And I Finally Get A Moment To Myself,  
I Will Realize You Were Everything I'm Missing,  
And You'll Tell Me You're In Love With Someone Else  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Verse 3:(Drake)  
  
The Girl Of The World, You See Someone Gotta Lose  
I Thought I Can Have It All, Do I Really Gotta Choose  
What Good Is All The Cash, If It Doesn't Buy Time,  
And What Good Is Bein' Famous, If I'm Never On Your Mind,  
Nights Fallen, Lights Glowin' And I'm Just Tryna Pay The Price Owin',  
And I Don't Wanna Feel The Comfort From My Ice Showin',  
And I Ain't Tryna Be Without You At The Right Moments,  
Nigga Nice Goin',  
Is It Worth It, That Decision,  
Cause Hearts Breakin', I Ain't Tryna Be In That Collision,  
So Imma Dust My Shirt, And Fix My Pants,  
Cause I Better Look Good Girl If This My Chance, I Swear  
  
[Chorus:]

[Intro: Lil Wayne]  
Thats what they doin' Cameron, they actin' like these singers man. I ain't
goin' to the studio until I have a situation. A subject, I need a beat, I need
the producer. Who gonna be on the hook? Man what is you doin? We're in the
studio with fuckin' clips, clips, ammo!  
  
[Verse 1]  
Brand new beretta, can't wait to let it go  
Walk up in my label like, where the check though?  
Yeah I said it, wouldn't dap you with the left ho  
Shut the fuck up, text from a centerfold  
I ain't reply, let 'em know I read it though  
Voice mail say she ready though  
Niggas know I'm credible  
Ain't no pussy on a pedestal  
Got my foot on the 'cedes Benz pedal doin' 90 on the bridge like  
Nigga you already know  
And if you don't know, now you know, now you know  
Switchin' up the angles  
Now I'm in the Rolls with illuminated angel  
Four or five chains made of gold getting tangled  
My nigga Biz said "the first mil gonna change you"  
Change for the better, hit it then dead her  
Thats my vendetta, keep this shit together  
God damn we ain't even got a scam  
Cocaine Coupe, we ain't even gotta scale  
Used to flip apps, now that old plug murked  
Ain't a damn thing changed you can still get to work  
(Just hold on one moment and someone will be right with you)  
(We're sorry, you have reached a number that has been disconnected or is no
longer in service)  
  
[Verse 2]  
Yeah, I remember how I went to Louis V with Haf'  
Watched them spread ten thousand dollars on the glass  
I never ever thought I'd see that in my life  
Now I'm in the east cause my boys are gettin' right  
Man, I was on TV makin' fifty racks a year  
After helpin' mama out the shit would disappear  
I am not a man, I can't do this on my own  
So I started askin' them if they would put me on  
And they did put me on  
Yeah, the did put me on  
Now we in the basement and we workin' on the phone  
Now we in the basement and we workin' on the phone, line  
Line blowin' up, workin on the phones  
Now we in the basement and we workin' on the phones  
But I just couldn't do it had to leave that shit alone man  
  
[Skit]  
Hear what? [?]  
(Laughing)  
Ahh, no shit  
[?]  
In fright, in fright in our sleep, alright [?] Drizzy  
  
[Hook]  
Blowin' up, line blowin' up  
They need the whole thing  
Blowin' up, my niggas really need the whole thing  
Blowin' up, line blowin' up  
They need the whole thing  
Blowin' up, my niggas really need the whole thing  
  
[Verse 3]  
I do better with the writer in my system  
Oh yeah, I'm on deck when you call me I'll listen  
I listen unless I been mixin'  
You know when I'm mixin'  
You know when I'm mixin', I smoke when I drink its tradition  
Like Zoe mama I go hippy  
Peace sign in the air like I'm Nixon  
I'm mixin', I am not Esco but it was written  
I knew when they didn't  
I been had these visions of the life I'm livin' since I was Jimmy  
All I just had to do was go and get it  
  
[Hook]  
Blowin' up, line blowin' up  
They need the whole thing  
Blowin' up, my niggas really need the whole thing  
Blowin' up, line blowin' up  
They need the whole thing  
Blowin' up, my niggas really need the whole thing

I'm performin tonight you know that shit gon be packed  
Pay me in advance and make sure that it's exact  
My ex girl'll probably show up for the simple fact  
That tomorrow she can tell all of her friends it was whack  
But?  
This about me  
They say my whole fan base is missin I'd  
What the young trend settin musician I be  
Got critics givin up the recognition I de-serve  
Never bring yo mrs. By me  
I'm it I'm it call me mr. i-t  
If I get one wish imma wish to die free  
They say gon head, ball like mrs.?  
And I do  
The realest in my age group, no shit

Lets make a toast, tell yo friends come closer  
Drinks on me like a coaster

And this is how my speech goes  
I deserve this shit, I deserve this shit, I deserve this shit  
That's all I got to say, at the top is where I stay  
And tell my haters never go away, the winner  
Long awaited, hated  
Fans see me out and they holla happy belated  
It's about time that you made it  
I was bumpin yo songs when nobody else played it  
When I was up in? in atlanta steady givin daps  
Fetchin niggas drinks but I never got to rap?  
If anybody asked though I prolly woulda snapped  
But I can't sign nothin til my lawyer get the fax and  
No one decides who the definition of talent is  
And mrs.? look at what my talent did  
And what yo business is?  
It's been a couple years  
Guess it's not about who you know, it's just how you balance it  
It's always awkward to... a nigga artist  
And get on someone song when you know you comin the hardest  
It's how you start actin when nobody can reach ya  
My plan just hatched, happy easter  
I'm doin it big  
Look at what I done  
Look at where I'm is

Cause I was stayin home  
When they was havin fun

That's all I got to say  
At the top is where I stay  
And tell my haters never go away, the winner

A lot of people sayin fuck me  
Problem is they be tellin everybody but me

And I never trust a nigga sayin trust me  
Nick cannon and will neva did it this I'll  
So you tell... don't you dare interrupt me  
Thanks to my mother for never givin up  
You deserve the world, now gon live it up

I could never give back everything you gave us  
And to my dad even though we was apart

[Verse 1]  
I've been out walking  
I don't do too much talking these days  
These days  
These days I seem to think a lot  
About the things, I forgot to do  
  
[Hook]  
These days  
  
[Verse 2]  
I've met some women  
I wish I had resisted these days  
These days  
These days I seem to think  
About how I have failed  
To change all of my ways  
  
[Hook]  
These days  
  
[Verse 3]  
Yeah, I had a lover  
Don't think I'd risk another  
These days  
These days  
And if I seem to be afraid  
Just listen to the life I've made in songs  
  
[Hook]  
These days  
  
[Verse 4]  
I've stopped the dreaming  
I don't do too much scheming  
These days  
These days  
I sit inside chauffeur car  
With windows down and count the stars  
These days  
These days

Yeah  
Ninth wonder  
They tend to say that us rappers  
Are materialistic  
They say we lak substince  
Me tay and L  
Bout to prove them wrong dou  
  
(Chorus)  
We know what you thinkin love  
You think we out smokin

Chains clinkin love  
Well you don't really kno me  
Lik you think you kno me  
And we kno how you speculate  
Thinkin we gone hit your friend  
If you object a date  
Claim we early but be showin up extra late love  
But you don't really kno me like you think you kno me  
  
(DRAKE)  
They don't be sayin that I'm humble  
And I'm hella nice  
But I've been approached ta sellma rockafella twice  
Niggas tell you all the rumors dey heard  
And we laugh  
Soon as you come and tell me  
Lik I'm ellen brice  
Ma groove theorie  
Is that when yu to cheery  
They try to bring you down  
To the level they at  
Well when they are all unhappy  
And it gets a little sticky  
That's why I am little nikki  
To these devils in rap  
But uh  
They aint thinkin drake is smart girl  
They probley think I brake ya  
Heart gurl  
I can't lie  
You probley right about it  
And if you give me dat ass quick  
I probley write about it  
But I hate it when they judge me on how I sound  
I mean I spit that influencial shit  
From my town  
I don't know why you sittin on the couch  
When you see I got a bed  
Bring your ass here and lie dwn  
You kan take your purse off  
And later on we takin shirts off  
And then your skirt off  
At least I got status because I could have been a local MC and you probley
would be worst off  
So ima take dis hat off  
And ima hit it till I'm back soft  
And den I back soft  
Cus you thinkin you could prevent what happen  
  
You the reason I think I'm gettin sick of rappin  
  
(Chorus)  
We know what you thinkin love  
You think we out smokin  
Nd drinkin love  
Pushing beard whips  
Chains clinkin love  
Well you don't really kno me  
Lik you think you kno me  
And we kno how you speculate  
Thinkin we gone hit your friend  
If you object a date  
Claim we early but be showin up extra late love  
But you don't really kno me like you think you kno me  
  
(Tay)  
You probley think I walk around wit ma gun tucked in  
Swing dick to dis hoes lik nun chucks well  
You can think what you want but  
I think you been watchin to much BET uncut  
You need ta get real  
And check out ma real life  
I aint a tip drill  
Dnt kare wat it smell lik  
But if you feel lik  
Puttin all your noshins aside  
And talkin to a real nigga  
I gladly ablige  
First name fontay  
I'd b pleased ta date you  
College educated  
Got degrees and paper  
But I'm from the south were if you aint snappin or rappin bout trappin  
Yous a freak of nature  
Such a animalie  
Speak so well  
And talk so collegie  
Such a astonishing contrast  
To all the bullshit youve been following  
On ma behalf of dem I offer ma apology  
Maybe wit me you'll unlearn  
Puttin all niggas in a box of concerns  
Me cus I aint them  
Shit I'm well read like sun burn  
And afta me you'll neva leave  
No stone unturned  
  
(Chorus)  
We know what you thinkin love

Well you don't really kno me  
Lik you think you kno me

If you object a date  
Claim we early but be showin up extra late love  
But you don't really kno me like you think you kno me

[Chorus:]  
Loves Lost  
Loves Gone  
Love Lost  
Love Is Gone [x2]  
  
[Verse 1: Drake]  
Look,  
In This World Of Desperate Housewives And Freakin Players  
Rappers They Tend To Be Smilin  
Because They Swimmin In Women  
Most Of Em Sick Of Favors  
They Come In Secret Flavors  
That's Why I Envy Omar  
Because So Far, I'm Nowhere Close To Malik and Deja  
  
And that's Some Higher Learning  
Trying Ta Excel With The Brake On  
I'll Have You Stuck In The Same Spot  
With The Tires Burnin  
And I'm A Liar Turnin 19, Jaded With No Faith  
In Any Female that's Askin What I Was Earnin  
I Met This Recent Lady  
She Knew A Piece Of Sadey By Spinners  
I Guess In My Southern Eyes That She Decent Maybe  
Well Second Thought If We Have It Then She Can Keep The Baby  
Cuz She Aint Give Me The Butterflies That Aleshia Gave Me  
It's Like I'm Using Some Bread To Sop Up Some Decent Gravy  
Now I'm Out Of Both And I've Been Thinkin Of Aleshia Lately  
I'm All Alone, I Got A Feelin it's On  
Cuz Nowadays Most Of The Thrill Of Chillin Is Gone And Uh  
  
[Chorus:]  
Loves Lost  
Loves Gone  
Love Lost  
Love Is Gone  
  
[Verse 2: Drake]  
Some Dudes They Turn Purple With Hurt Faces  
Circling Workplaces  
And Following Girls On The Assumptions Of What The Worst Case Is  
They Get To First Bases  
Then They Get To Retreating Cuz If She Cheatin  
Theye Wanna Know What The First Trace Is  
Now You Like Macgyver  
Cuz You Sneakin Around  
And She don't Know That You There When You Standin Right Beside Her  
I can't Relate To That  
I Had To Take It Back A Couple A Years  
When Some Of The Best Kicked It With Drake In Fact  
  
I Bet That They Knew It Cuz In My Mind I Play Through It  
With Yoshi Lee And A. Lewis And A Couple Things That They True In  
And In The End I Listen But I don't See Me As They Do  
Cuz it's My Opinion, My Life, My Potentials For My Wife  
And I Used To Be Eager To Buy Em The World  
Maybe I'm Confused About What I Desire From Girls  
Either Way I'm All Alone, Got A Feelin it's On  
Cuz Nowadays Most Of The Thrill Of Just Chillin Is Gone And Uh  
  
[Chorus:]  
Loves Lost  
Loves Gone  
Love Lost  
Love Is Gone  
  
[Verse 3: Drake]  
Check,  
And Nowadays Some Girls Are The Type Of Person That  
Will Tell They Friends That They Use Him Which Is Confusin  
Since I Aint Made Them A Purchase Yet  
But there's Logic Behind It  
Emotions Double And They Try To Cover Up  
Like A Mansion With The Projects Behind It  
I Tend To Freak With This  
I Get A Girl And Pretend That I Love The Spendin  
And All She Gave Was A Decent Kiss  
Thinkin She Been Spoiled  
But Golddiggin Is Nothing When You Can Shovel For Days  
And Come Up With Tin Foil  
  
We Could Dissect It See  
You Take A Dominique Or Another Freak In The Sheets  
And You Picture That She Just Slept With Me For Nothing  
Gave Her Nothing  
Her Reputations In Jeopardy  
Cuz It Aint Take Her 3 Of That Shopping To Get Her Next To Me  
Collectively I Look For A Proper Chick That'll Rep For Me  
Instead Of Seeing Something She Wants And Callin And Textin Me  
For Thinkin That Exists, I Got A Feeling I'm Wrong  
Nowadays Most Of The Thrill Of Just Chillin Is Gone And Uh  
  
[Chorus:]  
Loves Lost  
Loves Gone  
Love Lost  
Love Is Gone

Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much  
There's no need for us to rush it through  
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much  
This is more than just a new lust for you  
  
Done saying, I'm done playing  
Last time was on the outro  
Stuck in the house, need to get out more  
I've been stacking up like I'm fundraising  
Most people in my position get complacent  
Come places with star girls, end up on them front pages  
I'm quiet but I just ride with it  
Moment I stop having fun with it, I'll be done with it  
I'm the only one that's putting shots up  
And like a potluck, you need to come with it  
Don't run from it, like H-Town in the summer time, I keep it 100  
Lot of girls in my time there, word to Paul Wall, not one fronted  
I was birthed there in my first year, man I know that place like I come from
it  
Backstage at Warehouse in '09 like "Is Bun coming?  
Fuck that, is any one coming 'fore I show up there and ain't no one there?"  
These days, I could probably pack it for like twenty nights if I go in there  
Back rub from my main thing, I've been stressed out  
Talking to her like back then they didn't want me, I'm blessed now  
Talking to her like this drop, bet a million copies get pressed out  
She tell me, "Take a deep breath, you're too worried about being the best out"  
  
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much  
There's no need for us to rush it through  
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much  
This is more than just a new lust for you  
  
Someone go tell Noel to get the Backwoods  
Money got my whole family going backwards  
No dinners, no holidays, no nothing  
There's issues at hand that we're not discussing  
Look, I did not sign up for this  
My uncle used to have all these things on his bucket list  
And now he's acting like, oh, well, this is life, I guess, "Nah, fuck that
shit  
Listen man, you can still do what you wanna do, you gotta trust that shit"  
Heard once that in dire times when you need a sign, that's when they appear  
Guess since my text message didn't resonate, I'll just say it here  
Hate the fact my mom cooped up in her apartment, telling herself  
That she's too sick to get dressed up and go do shit, like that's true shit  
And all my family from the M-Town that I've been 'round, started treating me
like I'm "him" now  
Like we don't know each other, we ain't grow together, we just friends now  
Shit got me feeling pinned down, pick the pen up and put the pen down  
Writing to you from a distance like a pen pal, but we've been down  
  
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much  
There's no need for us to rush it through  
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much  
This is more than just a new lust for you  
  
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much  
There's no need for us to rush it through  
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much  
This is more than just a new lust for you

[Intro: DMX]  
What these bitches want from a nigga?  
  
[Verse 1]  
On some DMX shit  
I group DM my exes  
I tell 'em they belong to me, that goes on for forever  
And I think we just get closer when we not together  
You tell me that I'm confusin'  
More immature than Marques Houston  
Cuts too deep for a band-aid solution  
We too deep in this thing you'll never lose me  
LOLOL I'm glad you find this shit amusin'  
Heard a lot about me 'fore we started off  
I know you heard that my pool parties like Mardi Gras  
I know you heard that my girl is sponsored by Audemars  
That's why she's always correctin' me when my time is off  
And my house is the definition  
Of alcohol and weed addiction  
You got a different vision  
You wanna walk around naked in the kitchen  
Without runnin' into one of my niggas  
That's not the way we livin'  
Too much goin' on, it's just not realistic  
These days I don't talk 'bout them days like I miss 'em  
And you shouldn't miss 'em either, we different people  
But every time we speakin'  
  
[Hook]  
It's like a lot of games bein' played  
How's it goin' down?  
If it's on 'til we gone then I gots to know now  
Is you wit' me or what?  
Yeah  
It's like a lot of games are bein' played  
How's it goin' down?  
If it's on 'til we gone then I gots to know now  
Is you wit' me or what?  
Yeah  
  
[Verse 2]  
I wanna know how much time you spent on them paragraphs  
Where you're getting me  
All that grey in our conversation history, you  
Playin' mind games, when you sayin' things  
Playin' mime games, we both doin' the same thing  
Slide on a late night  
You like to slide on a late night  
You send the "are you here?" text without an invite  
That's that shit that I don't like  
We both slide on a late night  
Do things in our off time  
We both, yeah  
Made some mistakes, pon road  
Yeah, how's that for real?  
You toyin' with it like Happy Meal  
3 dots, you thinkin' of a reaction still  
While you're typin' make sure you tell me  
  
[Hook]  
What type of games are bein' played?  
How's it goin' down?  
If it's on 'til we gone then I gots to know now  
Is you wit' me or what?  
Yeah  
What type of games are bein' played?  
How's it goin' down?  
If it's on 'til we gone then I gots to know now  
Is you wit' me or what?  
Yeah  
  
[Verse 3]  
Remember you was livin' at The London for a month  
Service elevator up to 4201  
We was still a secret, couldn't come in through the front  
Girl I had your back when all you used to do was front  
That's for sure though, I made a career off reminiscin'  
Time got a funny way of tickin', things are so much different  
I'll admit it, I've admitted to a lot of things  
Act like you know it, fuck them stories, fuck the shade they throwin'  
Understand I got responsibilities to people that I need  
And on my way to make this dough  
A lot of niggas cut the cheque so they can take this flow  
A lot of niggas cut the cheque so they can take this flow, Ohhh, ohhh!  
Tryna give your ass the world  
You runnin' your fingers through my curls  
You knew me when the kid had waves  
But that's enough of that  
You could never say I came up and forgot about your ass  
And that's some real shit

Bridge over troubled water, ice in my muddy water  
Rich off a mixtape, got rich off a mixtape  
Probably shouldn't be driving, it just got so much harder  
Can't even steer straight, I can't even steer straight  
Oh, fuck with me, I buy the shots  
Live a little, cause niggas die a lot, and lie a lot  
But I'm the truth that's right I fucking said it  
The living proof that you ain't gotta die to get to heaven  
You girl, you right there, you look like you like this shit  
How'd I know, how'd I know? That's me on some psychic shit  
I can tell a lie if you ask me about my whereabouts  
But I might talk that real if you ask me what I care about  
Reppin' bitches, reppin' bitches bitches  
And reppin' reppin' them bitches until all of us switches  
I swear, it's been two years since somebody ask me who I was  
I'm the greatest man I said that before I knew I was  
That's what's important and what really happened before this  
When me and my crew was all about this rapper from New Orleans  
Singing walking like a man, finger on the trigger  
I got money in my pocket, I'm a uptown nigga, ah  
With fame on my mind, my girl on my nerves  
I was pushing myself to get something that I deserve  
That was back in the days, Acura days  
I was a cold dude, I'm getting back to my ways  
  
[Chorus]  
People always ask how I got my nice things  
Take my crown to the grave, I'm an underground king  
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told  
Cause I'm down to spend whatever, lately I've been on a roll  
And I do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga  
Do it for the city, cause you know the city love it a nigga  
Do it for the city, cause you know the city love it a nigga  
Do it for the city, (UGK fuck these other niggas)  
  
Sometimes I need that romance, sometimes I need that pole dance  
Sometimes I need that stripper that's gon' tell me that she don't dance  
Tell me lies, make it sound good, make it sound good  
Do me like the women from my town would  
Leather with that woodgrain, Persian rugs on wood floors  
Talking all them good things, that's all I'm really good for  
Memphis Tennessee no, see I start to go deep back  
And rich crust with my seat back with Yo Gotti and E-Mack  
And these niggas got them diamonds glowing in they mouth  
And they rockin' furs like it's snowing in the south  
And every pretty girl tell me that's the shit that she like  
So why am I a classic, this is who I'm trying to be like  
So I drop out, lessons I was taught are quick to fade  
As soon I realize that term-end papers they won't get me paid  
If I don't nothing I'ma ball  
I'm countin' all day like a clock on the wall  
Yeah need that, making major changes to the life I'm living  
I had no choice, I had to prove I made the right decisions  
That was back in the days, Acura days  
I was a cold dude, I'm getting back to my ways  
  
[Chorus]

My name is Drizzy  
And I ain't perfect  
But I work hard  
So I deserve it  
And I belong right where you see me  
I ain't on the fence about it  
I ain't Mr. Feeny  
Naw, I got a decent set of manners  
And a job that fills up any empty schedule or planner  
And I fall in love with girls caught up in superficial glamour  
Who dress like Sarah Jessica and  
Live like Princess Diana  
So often they have addictions and  
I'm no one that'll feed it  
But truly you're bad enough  
That you don't even really need it  
You can show up at the party on dirty public transit  
And I guarantee the camera man will still be snappin  
Candids of you and yo posse partying  
Drinking watch you get handed  
With your virgin island tans  
All lookin like you just landed  
I don't really understand it  
I'm not sure I'm comprehending it  
But these girls are having fun with  
Whoevers money they spending screaming  
  
[Chorus 2x]  
  
I got to be unstoppable  
I got to be unstoppable  
Ey, ey, ey, ey  
You don't lie  
Ey, ey, ey, ey  
You don't lie  
  
[Verse 2:] Weezy F. Baby  
  
My name is Weezy  
I'm almost perfect  
And I work harder than hardworking bizarre circus  
That's when my bars surface  
Therefore, I act a clown  
Even when I'm laying on my back,  
I'm never backing down  
So overstand me  
I gotta condo in Miami and  
My doormat is always sandy  
And I run Louisiana  
But I've never pull a hammy  
And I gotta condo in Atlanta  
And I always wear a bandana  
And when it comes down to stuntin you boys  
Is just buntin  
I'm swinging from the fence  
Yo girl hanging from my dick  
Yo girl singing to my shit  
Like a la, la, lollipop  
She say I get that pussy wetter than a dasani shop  
She say I get that pussy better  
Better than her gynecologist  
Hoe just text me  
Everybody want some mo dick mo dick  
Old bitch  
Young bitch  
But I'll be like damnnnn  
All I got is one dick  
  
[Chorus 2x]  
  
[Bridge:] Santogold  
  
I got the talk  
The beats and bass  
Give me one I'll take it  
Make you lose your place,  
Tell me I-I-I can play  
So I speed up the pace  
I break it break it you can't stop me  
In this ra-race  
  
[Chorus 2x]

Yeah, uh huh  
  
Uh, hardly home but always reppin',  
You hardly on and always second,  
When I'm awake you always restin',  
And when they call you the answer you will hardly question,  
I, I'm doin' classic shit in all my sessions,  
Other nigga's situations they are all depressin',  
That's why I never follow y'all suggestions,  
I just always did my own thing,  
Now I run the game, you stupid mudda-suckas  
I see all this money through my Ohio State buck eyes,  
Shit been goin' good, but good can turn to better,  
Cause you the type to lose her, and I'm about to get her  
  
[Chorus]  
It's okay  
It's okay  
It's okay  
It's okay  
It's okay  
It's okay  
You can run an tell your friends that  
I'm on  
I'm on  
I'm on  
I'm on  
I'm on  
I'm on  
Best believe I understand  
It's okay  
It's okay  
It's okay  
It's okay  
It's okay  
It's okay  
You can run an tell my city  
I'm on  
I'm on  
I'm on  
I'm on  
I'm on  
I'm on  
You can run an tell my city it's on  
  
Yeah, wrong way down a one way,  
Women don't get saved 'round me even on a Sunday,  
Damn where I get it from, these niggas always wonder who,  
Then they meet my pop and tell 'em "Drake is just a younger you"  
And shawty wanna party so don't let yo girl up out the house  
Or there'll be shots on T-M-Z, of me givin' her mouth-to-mouth,  
Now she's famous and the paparazzi starts to shoot her,  
I drive two black cars I named 'em Malcom X an' Martin Luther  
I don't ever play but I'm in the game lady,  
They just loose to love, those are tennis games lady,  
Have you countin' money goin' duffle bag crazy,  
Sippin' on Pink Floyd an puffin' Wayne Brady,  
Damn, who's line is it anyways,  
I'm in a daze, you been amazed,  
Y'all seem to be stuck on that beginner stage,  
I'm on fire, yup I've been a blaze,  
I got dough to blow, but I wanna blow it right,  
You look nice, and yo' frame, makes me wanna bowl a strike  
Well alright, guess I might, know what? Fuck it, yes I will,  
I am more than what you bargained for and nothin' less than real  
Put it to you like  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Bun B King of the Trill also one of the dopest,  
Whether the streets or on the mic, I'm dope and yes I'm focused,  
That gangsta recognize me for my locc ness no joke it's,  
Time to shake these haters off like the skin of a Locus,  
Or maybe like a python that's the type a shit I'm on,  
I wrote this on my iPhone so let me drop this iBomb,  
I palm the game like its a Splading ball and take flight,  
From the free throw line and slam it down like I'm the great Mike  
Bun an Wayne an Drake in here man this goin' be a great night,  
Look at all these posers bite, our swagger like a great white,  
Try to cross me over I just fake left then I break right,  
Stupid animal tricks like David Letterman's Late Night,  
This that major moment you've been waitin' on for too long,  
The best that ever did it an doin' it on a new song,  
U-G-K an Young Money too strong  
Bound to be in the green like a crouton,  
So what the fuck is you on?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I am the leather jacket, black glasses, All-American bad boy  
I own the swagger supermarket an' you, you just a bag boy  
Cause I got that swag boy, the swag you never had boy  
Hate an' I will leave ya chest the color of my flag boy  
Soo woo bitch, I do this shit, I'll erase you like I drew you bitch  
An' I keep that toaster you can come an be my strudel bitch  
I'm so uptown, and motherfucker look at Wayne  
Don't go uptown yeah  
And now I'm on this rock shit,  
But why they let me in I'm a start shootin' in a mosh pit, ha ha  
Fuck is you talkin' bout, Weezy in ya mouth now  
Weezy whatchu talkin' bout  
(Young mula baby!)  
  
[Chorus]

[Intro:]  
The only thing I'm seeing I'd like to put an amend on  
Perhaps a little more room here for the fixins  
Oh, we gon' have a lot of fixins  
We gonna have so many fucking fixins up in this motherfuckers  
His shit gon' go through the roof  
Got damn I'm shittin' gold these days  
  
[Hook:]  
Nigga we made it, hey  
We made it  
Nigga we made it, hey  
Damn, we made it  
Nigga we made it, hey  
We made it, aye  
Nigga we made it, hey  
We made it  
  
[Drake]  
She said she workin' for Walgreens but not in the store, at the head office  
The head was so good it make sense why you work at the head office  
In 2007 I sat in a lobby in Motown and waited  
Now I go into the buildin' and go off like "Nigga we made it!"  
When I walk through these halls, man this beat should be playin'  
I just came to make sure you not missin' no payments  
Now turn this shit down while I issue my statement  
It needed a moment of silence, nigga we made it!  
You fly out your lady, I fly out my ladies  
Bitches can't front on the kid anymore, man they know what my name is  
And if by chance she don't know who I am, she just know that I'm famous  
Imma just hand her a business card and say "Nigga we made it!"  
And she gotta come to the hotel and pop it off for me  
Then she gon' text her best friend like "Girl he got some good dick and money"  
Her friend hit her back like "I know that already, that nigga's amazin'"  
Then I send a message to both of they asses like "Nigga we made it!"  
  
[Interlude]  
Kinda makes me wonder why the hell so many people are tryna tell me to slow
down  
Seems like motherfuckers should be shuttin' the hell up and enjoyin' the show  
  
Hey  
We made it  
Nigga we made it, hey  
Damn, we made it  
Nigga we made it, hey  
We made it, aye  
Nigga we made it, hey  
We made it  
  
[Drake]  
If they with me, just know that they wit' it and 'bout it  
If I said it, I meant it, it's no way around it  
Ovo reps them so P Reign next up, watch he about to go crazy  
When Baca came home for the holidays, I was like "Nigga we made it!"  
And all of those lawyer fees, nigga I paid it  
My family get all of my loyalty, all of my patience  
My life for your life, man I wouldn't trade it  
I would just look at you dead in the face and say "Nigga we made it"  
I swear that we made it  
But I've been on that wave, that's why this year I tell yah, I don't need no
favors  
(Damn, Soulja Boy stunt on them haters)  
And my resolution for New Years is nigga we made it  
You don't know how long I waited, I coulda been waitin' on tables, my karma's
amazin'  
I'm out in the Caymans, rented a 12-bedroom house just to sleep all the women
we came with  
That's ignorant, ain't it? Sometimes I question myself when I think 'bout the
pictures I painted  
Then I pick up my brush and I sign at the bottom like "Nigga we made it"  
  
[Hook:]  
Hey  
We made it  
Nigga we made it, hey  
Damn, we made it  
Nigga we made it, hey  
We made it, aye  
Nigga we made it, hey  
We made it  
  
[Soulja Boy]  
Tellin' my partner, and my momma, everything gonna be all good  
Nigga we made it! Damn, I'm up in Las Vegas  
Damn, I never was supposed to have shit, now my life is lavish  
Every night, fuckin' a bad bitch, nigga we made it!  
Coppin' a Lambo, cash, the Bentley, 2 times I crashed  
Ha, nigga we made it!  
Look at them niggas' faces, them niggas, they hate it  
I look a nigga in his face and say "Nigga we made it!"  
Soulja Boy stunt on them haters  
And these days I don't need no favors  
Nigga we made it!

Yeah, never thoughts of suicide, I'm too alive  
But I still treat it likes it's do or die  
Even though dying isn't in the plans,  
But neither was making it and here I am  
In the presidential do you like your new room?  
Always presidential and tonight's no blue moon  
Since I saw Aliyah's precious life go too soon,  
She deserve the credit for how I'm about to get it  
That's why I got a new dumb thing moving through the street  
Got a new condo, move it to the beach  
Heard Nicki just bought a brand new crib  
Goddamn man she's beauty and the beast (Lord)  
Seems like yesterday that I was up and coming  
Still so young that I ain't had enough of nothing  
  
The fam here, the drink here, the girls here?  
Well fuck let's get it then  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm trying to let go of the past  
Should we make this one a double?  
You ain't even gotta ask, ah  
Because it's hard to say no, say no  
Yeah it's hard to say no  
Are you down, are you down? Yea you all the way down, every time  
(Every time, every time, every time)  
Am I down, am I down? Yea I'm all the way down, we'll be fine  
(We'll be fine, we'll be fine, we'll be fine)  
Are you down, are you down? Yea you all the way down, every time  
(Every time, every time, every time)  
Am I down, am I down? Yea I'm all the way down, we'll be fine  
(We'll be fine, we'll be fine, we'll be fine)  
  
Used to make us proud we had dreams of getting bigger man  
Loved you until now, but now I'm the nigga man  
You keep talking that "You was this and you had this  
And you deserve some fucking credit how did anyone forget it."  
Got a show up in your city, yo girl is in the line  
And the line around the corner it's my motherfucking time  
You should take it as a sign, man I got it right now.  
I wouldn't doubt it cause these bitches all about it right now  
Let's be real about this shit, can I take you home?  
Or come to where you stay? Do you live on your own?  
I heard you got your ways, I never would have known  
She said "you're such a dog" I said "you're such a bone."  
I've been everywhere, where you know me from?  
These days women give it to me like they owe me one  
But they crave attention though they always saying "Show me something."  
But girl you ain't the only one that's trying to be the only one  
At least I admit that, if you get that, and you with that  
Then fuck let's get it then  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah, Drizzy. Yo turn nigga!  
Take care of the business nigga (shine on these niggas)  
Give these niggas the business nigga!  
Kill spray anything in the way nigga, fuck em! We don't love em!  
Yeah, it's just that uptown gangsta shit  
Toronto, stand up for one of the realest niggas, Drizzy, with the realest flow  
Toast to this gangsta shit. OVO-YMCMB  
You understand me?  
Playing with these motherfucking millions like they ain't nothing  
Rubber band stacks. That YMCMB shit nigga, flashy lifestyle, one hundred
