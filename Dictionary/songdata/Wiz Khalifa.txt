Up early, smokin' and plottin'  
Looking at these lames being thankful I'm not them  
This year couple million out the game  
And you're wondering how I got them  
I got it from going hard, I always stay on my job  
Wanna get high you should come to my spot then  
And smoke with some heavyweight niggas  
Jets, Taylor Gang nigga losing's not a option  
Now I'm always on the road  
And everywhere I go people asking what I'm rocking  
I tell em this is next year's fresh and this year's best  
And some shit you niggas not in, so quit copyin'  
  
Yeah man  
You niggas got it confused, trying to do what the fuck we do  
That's not the point  
The point is for you to do you  
It's a beautiful thing  
  
I'm in the regal, you in a rut  
Stuck, can't come up  
Old, jealous niggas hatin' on us  
Bitches is wishin' you'd shut the fuck up  
I'm in the position, set my niggas up tough  
What the fuck, just jump  
Continents I promise it  
I could go from bucks to billions in a minute  
Made a split second decision  
Executed with precision  
I feel attention when I walk in the room  
Old cuddly ass niggas go to hidin' they woman  
Thinkin' I'mma walk up to 'em, but I don't do it  
Baby girl know the big shit from the manure  
I could help you shine like a jeweler  
Candy paint make an old whip newer

Um, it's hardly a secret  
You ain't gon' stop tryna get where you going until you reach it  
Always had them bars back in the day  
When the same ones running up on you wasn't speaking  
Look at all your achievements  
You work hard so it'd be kinda hard not to believe that  
You party every weekend (weekend)  
Fuck 'em all who act like they ain't see it then  
All them nights on the plane  
Buses nigga too, had to charge it to the game  
Always wanted stardom and the fame  
Learn to out smart 'em  
And now it ain't no stopping the champagne from poppin'  
The draws from droppin'  
Us seeing muscle cars and coppin' 'em  
Started off just a little less popular, yea  
  
Now you got a new place  
You drive a new car  
You smile for cameras live life like a superstar  
Don't care what they say  
You reach for the stars  
Got everything you always dreamed or thought about  
And everyone knows who you are  
  
Never gets boring  
And haters in your face you just ignore 'em  
Don't know what they talking shit for  
Seems niggas get there's you just tryna get yours therefore,  
You left all the people you care for  
Hopped on a plane and got air born  
Seen all the bullshit and fell for it  
But it's all good now  
'Cause the same ones that talk shit  
Telling everyone you made it  
Then you start seein' hoes you dated  
And your thoughts started getting jaded  
Now your life's sort of different ain't it  
Feel your scars knowin' what your pain is  
But whats it all worth if its painless  
Say you wanna be famous, yea  
  
Now you got a new place  
You drive a new car  
You smile for the cameras live life like a superstar  
Don't care what they say  
You reach for the stars  
Got everything you always dreamed or thought about  
And everyone knows who you are  
  
Are, are, are, are, are, are, are,  
Are, are, are, are, are, are, are,  
Who you are  
Are, are, are, are, are, are, are,  
Are, are, are, are, are, are, are  
Who you are  
  
Always knew I was this good  
But never knew I'd be this good  
Them niggas just startin' I've been doing it  
Hear 'em talk but they ain't living my life  
In the dark tryna get in my light  
But chances I don't give 'em guys twice  
Spendin' grands for hoes, this is the high life  
And for the camera's posing this the high life  
Bottles raising for my niggas not here  
I pour out a couple sips  
Blew 'em on the beach, I smoke for you on my trips  
Them days I was younger I knew this life was the shit  
But never like this  
It's so amazing, we ain't gotta duck shots  
We just pour and chase 'em  
Ain't worry bout it, 'cause they gon' hate  
Know where I'm going, look where I came from  
  
Now you got a new place  
You drive a new car  
You smile for the cameras live life like a superstar  
Don't care what they say  
You reach for the stars  
Got everything you always dreamed or thought about  
And everyone knows who you are  
Are, are, are, are, are, are, are,  
Are, are, are, are, are, are, are,  
Who you are

Diamonds all in my chain  
Young nigga doin' his thing  
Young nigga gon' stunt

My niggas just chillin'  
Young niggas in the building  
Young niggas get millions

And I want to celebrate  
Celebrate livin'

So I'ma celebrate  
Celebrate ballin'

Now all these bitches callin'  
Smoke, drink, blow checks

So I want to celebrate  
Celebrate livin'

Buy it all for my dawgs  
You buy it all for a bitch  
Broke niggas be jokin'  
Little niggas need coaching

My rolex fucked your bitch  
My chain shit on your car  
My rolex fucked your bitch

Rich niggas want more  
Bitch nigga I'm ballin'  
Rich nigga, Mike Jordan  
  
[Chorus: Rico Love]

Fall asleep  
Fall asleep  
  
I got a crib so fat that  
You'll get lost in that bitch  
I got a car so fast that if I push one button, you won't see nothin'  
I got a feelin' that if it wasn't for me it wouldn't be a lot of you niggas  
Well copy this then  
Spend a million, count another million boy  
  
Fall asleep  
Fall asleep  
Fall asleep  
Fall asleep  
Fall asleep  
Fall asleep  
  
I woke up in Hawaii today  
For real, I hope don't  
None, these little young niggas try me today  
Uh, 'cause between all of these closets and all of these boxes I got  
Ooh, I got so much swag  
That the people at the airport don't even wanna touch my bag  
Only nigga in first class  
  
Fall asleep  
Fall asleep  
Fall asleep  
And I roll that weed and get baked off before the plane even take off, nigga I  
Fall asleep  
Catch me on the road gettin' money I'm in a whole different country by the
time I  
Fall asleep uh  
Fall asleep  
  
I'm flyer than most of 'em  
They try and hate, but most love 'em  
Them dollars, got mo' of 'em  
Thanks to who supplyin' what I'm rollin' up  
All this kush in my mind got me slowin' up  
Don't gotta smoke, I get high enough for both of us  
Get a O and blow and get another O and blow another O  
  
Fall asleep  
Fall asleep  
Fall asleep  
Fall asleep  
Fall asleep  
Fall asleep  
Fall asleep  
Fall asleep  
Fall asleep  
Fall asleep  
Fall asleep

[Chorus]  
I had a dream that the whole world was staring at me  
I woke up and wasn't no one there,  
Wasn't no one there, yeah eh eh  
Same song to a different beat  
'Cause sometimes I feels like I'm the only one there  
I guess nobody cares, hey  
But everything's good until it goes bad  
And your gonna tell all the people about the fun you used to have  
It hurts when it don't last  
No easy way saying bye  
So I'm a spread my wings and head for the sky  
And I fly solo  
And I fly solo  
And I fly solo  
And I fly solo  
And I  
  
I'm tired of being tired  
And dealing with your B.S.,  
All the while supplying  
The money for your request  
Without me you're a dime  
But with me you're a buck fifty, ha ha  
I can get another one quickly  
But I'd rather weight it out  
Take the broken pieces try and fix it  
Or you could let your pride over weigh the right decision  
And I'll be in the sky you can pay your boy a visit  
Ha  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And I fly solo  
And I fly solo  
And I fly solo  
And I fly solo  
And I  
Remember what you said  
But what you say to me ain't guaranteed to always be the Gospel  
I was doing good way before I met you  
Now you're off the set  
And I'm a let you see the show go on without you  
Take a bow, think about it  
And hopefully we could be friends but I really doubt it  
See you be catching feeling's now and I be catching planes  
The story of my life, you're just another page  
  
But everything's good 'til it goes bad  
And your gonna tell all the people about the fun you used to have  
It hurts when it don't last  
Easy way saying bye  
So I'm a spread my wings and head for the sky  
And I fly solo  
And I fly solo  
And I fly solo  
And I fly solo  
And I  
  
I had a dream that the whole world was staring at me  
I woke up and wasn't no one there  
Wasn't no one there  
Yeah eh 'eah

We blowin' money bitch  
I go hard, I go hard, gettin' paid  
I go hard, I go hard, gettin' paid  
  
We don't even count the money no more we just blow it  
(We spend it all up)  
We don't even count the money no more we just throw it  
And make 'em pick it all up  
  
Money strapped to my waist  
Somewhere in the whip I'm in with no bass  
Flooded the trap I need a new place?  
Money got to go I told 'em there's no space  
Never love hoes, hoes I don't chase  
Only wear loc's the same as my race  
All I know is stunt, make a hater feel like shit to the point  
That he in another place? Real talk  
I-I-I ain't the one but I lean on haters, looking so clean on gator  
Try to jack me, I guarantee I'll put the beam on haters  
Hood nigga, when I come to this I'm stocked up  
Shit on my wrist tryna light this block up  
Nigga said I got a dope man swag, take a look at these jewels  
Every one of 'em rocked up  
And we still on the corner packed in  
Ace town president somethin' back then  
Hope the slut that I'm with got insurance so  
She know I'm about to run up on her back end  
Like I set of bad, she was gettin' plugged  
Can take it to the streets, take it to the club  
I don't rubber band shit I got trash bags  
Niggas make it rain, I'ma make it flood  
I ain't gonna talk shit I'ma talk bread  
I f a hater don't like it, tell 'em drop dead  
I'm in the hood like a fresh set of projects  
Where they either rock blue or they rock red  
I'm the king of the streets  
Ain't nobody finna take away what I came to get  
Audi R8 that I came is sick, with interior the color of a all white?  
  
We don't even count the money no more we just blow it  
(We spend it all up)  
We don't even count the money no more we just throw it  
(And make 'em pick it all up)  
We don't even count the money no more we just blow it  
(We spend it all up)  
We don't even count the money no more we just throw it  
(And make 'em pick it all up)  
  
Big weed in my joint, diss me there's no point  
Lil guy but still all my n-ggas got big heat they on point  
Rollin up while I drive, engine be in the trunk  
Decided in 2005 that I can fuck any bitch that I want  
Ooh, and, and and I ain't trying to stunt  
This a two seater my bitch can't help but ride up in the front  
Ballin' most n-ggas wont try to pick 'em up  
Throwin' so much money you even try to pick some up  
You tryin' different stuff look at how I block 'em out  
Smoke like a Cali nigga even when I'm in the south  
And when when my car come out the whores come out  
Don't even get on twitter no more  
'cause I'm what your bitch talkin' 'bout  
  
We don't even count the money no more we just blow it  
(We spend it all up)  
We don't even count the money no more we just throw it  
(And make 'em pick it all up)  
We don't even count the money no more we just blow it  
(We spend it all up)  
We don't even count the money no more we just throw it  
(And make 'em pick it all up)

Yeah, it's Young, ya know?  
Crack that shit down, roll that shit up, light that shit, pass it  
Nah, fuck that, face this one, yeah, this for all my true weed smokers  
Yeah, nigga ask me what's wrong with me  
  
I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank (that sticky, that icky)  
I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank (that sticky, that icky)  
I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank (that sticky, that icky)  
Purple, purple in my pocket, and my jeans sag low  
I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank (that sticky, that icky)  
I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank (that sticky, that icky)  
I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank (that sticky, that icky)  
Purple, purple in my pocket, and my jeans sag low  
  
I said I'm gone, off that pound of dank  
Ridin' in my ride, so blowed, don't know how to think  
But I'm stayin' high  
  
I'ma roll me a nice, long Swisher, filled with light green  
Oh, I think they like me, let me get a light, B (and then I'm gone)  
Off that Cali bud, what the fuck you chokin' on?  
  
Mr. Bud by the Zone, O's like Omarion  
And we ain't tuckin' nothin' cousin, what's the hold up?  
Keep 'em comin' back to back to back, we roll up ('til it's all gone)  
  
Get a pound, break it down, I ain't stingy, it's enough to go around  
And I'm blazin' right now, niggas tellin' me to hold on  
Crank it, twist it, light it, take a pull, and hold on (and then, I'm gone)  
  
I gotta have it, gotta have it, that's unheard about  
Rollin' up another blunt, before I put the first one out  
My eyes low, have me chiefin' 'til I choke  
Niggas askin' me what's wrong,  
Blew some smoke up out my nose, and said I'm gone  
  
I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank (that sticky, that icky)  
I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank (that sticky, that icky)  
I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank (that sticky, that icky)  
Purple, purple in my pocket, and my jeans sag low  
I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank (that sticky, that icky)  
I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank (that sticky, that icky)  
I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank (that sticky, that icky)  
Purple, purple in my pocket, and my jeans sag low  
  
I said I'm gone, off that brownish drank  
Niggas know how I roll, it look like my eyes closed  
Hennesey and Hydro, rhyme slow  
  
Nigga, I'm on a different type of a vibe  
This a different type of weed,  
And I'm a different type a high (my nigga, I'm gone)  
To a place that you probably never been in life  
  
Smokin' Purple Kryptonite, make sure you curl that Swisher right  
'Cause I ain't tryna have this home-grown runnin',  
Homie thinkin' he gon' smoke for free,  
I duck 'em, roll somethin' (then, I'm gone)  
  
In my ride, doin' 80 in a 45 Zone, half a zone  
Got me blown, I get more than high  
  
Fresh off of the plane  
Head straight into my hotel  
Weed man in every city, yeah I smoke well (even when I'm gone)  
  
I ain't the only one, all my niggas puff pounds  
Swingin' blunts 'round, sun up 'till sun down  
My eyes low, and my words are getting slow  
Niggas askin' me whats wrong,  
I blew some smoke up out my nose, and said I'm gone  
  
I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank (that sticky, that icky)  
I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank (that sticky, that icky)  
I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank (that sticky, that icky)  
Purple, purple in my pocket, and my jeans sag low  
I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank (that sticky, that icky)  
I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank (that sticky, that icky)  
I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank (that sticky, that icky)  
Purple, purple in my pocket, and my jeans sag low

Baby I go, hard so hard, sometimes it's hard to tell whether not I'm even on
my job  
Most of the time I'm running 'round, either that or I'm gone  
Some of these people hating, but we don't see 'em at all 'cause we done made
it, too far  
Got something to say then fuck 'em ain't trying to lose out on all of this for
nothing  
I'm usually just balling and shit, whatever I want, I'ma get  
No time to count the money that I got because all of it's getting spent  
And all of my niggas grind so all of us getting rich  
And most of these niggas fly but all of 'em ain't the shit  
That's why you holding me down, been doing it ever since  
Only one I wanna be 'round and counting up all these chips, wit'  
  
Whatever you want boy, I got it, got it  
Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it  
I'm everywhere you be, I can't see you without me  
Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it  
  
Whatever you want boy, I got it, got it  
Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it  
I'm everywhere you be, I can't see you without me  
Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it (got everything)  
  
And I, swear you deserve a wedding ring  
Can't ever see you choosing nothing over instead of me  
Won't ever leave you, you're the one I need so that's how I'm gonna treat you  
Take you places where they using different language to greet you  
Smile and shake when they meet you  
Lot of cake but you got a lot of love from me and when I'm home, you can't get
enough of me  
'Cause even when we both tired, you still put up with me  
Ain't going nowhere for sure, feel like you stuck with me  
Swear I feel lucky, I get anything I want  
And if I need it then you got it, if I say it then you trust me  
Don't see you much but when I do, I need your love and I'ma need it in a rush  
  
Whatever you want boy, I got it, got it  
Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it  
I'm everywhere you be, I can't see you without me  
Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it  
  
Whatever you want boy, I got it, got it  
Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it  
I'm everywhere you be, I can't see you without me  
Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it  
  
Baby I can't break you heart, make you wait no more  
Anytime you need me, I'll be right there for sure  
You don't even have to call me, just say my name  
I'll be right there waiting for you  
  
Whatever you want boy, I got it, got it  
Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it  
I'm everywhere you be, I can't see you without me  
Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it  
  
Whatever you want boy, I got it, got it  
Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it

Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it  
  
Whatever you want boy, I got it, got it  
Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it  
I'm everywhere you be, I can't see you without me  
Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it (got everything)

I'm so incredible wait  
Wit no metal to waist  
I flow great  
And that'll level ya face  
But I'll still let a nigga have it  
You talk greasy but you still a fagot  
I front on cowards cause you niggas backwards  
I got my money right  
Game on top  
And it's been said that I'm the key to put this game on lock  
I'm from the city  
Of the triflin' hoods  
But when you see me  
Gotta smile on my face  
Nothin' sweet, it's just that life is good  
Yea, I dodged the hood  
Slums came up out that  
Rap game about that  
To gain pay wit out crack  
See Imma youngin' wit' too much on my plate  
To let some small change have a youngin' dumped in a cage  
I seen niggas make sells  
Niggas get knocked and make bail  
And take lives, they worries ain't jail  
Wit no regards for life cause they livin' ain't well  
Who gotta make it to heaven cause they livin' in hell  
But me I don't do much just keep to myself  
And stop these cock-suckin' motha-fuckas seekin' my wealth  
I was told the world's cold but I see for my self  
And I'm too hot to take the back seat or the shelf  
So I'm here  
For sum reason though they hate it to death  
The love's gone only hatred is left  
Only achin' and stress  
A king not be mistaken for less  
And this here is for the taking  
This is history in the making  
  
Where I'm from it's kinda hard to trust  
Cause the hate's from most of your own people  
They're fake and they're all see through  
Hate to see a nigga when he's stackin' his bucks  
Rather him be down in the dumps  
And out on his luck  
But I'll be damned if my grind stop  
My mind tickin' like the time watch  
And I'm gon be spittin' 'till the time's not  
Presently there  
I touch minds everywhere  
And I'll ride hopin' heaven is near  
See the pain in your eyes young wit every stare  
I seek peace, but these streets will never be fair  
Cause somebody went and took Greg's life  
Son reached  
Deceased  
No time to blink or think twice damn  
Wonder when it gonna be my time  
To meet death  
I'm stressed need to ease my mind  
And unless one of y'all try to see whats mine  
Then I'll eat through your flesh, bones and leave that spine  
U see I did the right thing  
I stayed up out the gun and knife game  
I knew about the pain it might bring  
And we all got problems  
I chose to smoke blunts just to drown 'em  
The top, but I rose from the bottom  
And I'm here now  
Ain't no body harming young  
My screw's loose they say somethings wrong wit young  
Ya time's up I'm just warning young  
Cause this here's for the taking,  
This is history in the making

[Chorus]  
Yeah it's goin' down, yeah it's goin' down  
Watch it hit tha flo', watch it hit tha flo'  
Watch it hit tha flo', watch it hit tha flo'  
Watch it hit tha flo', watch it hit tha flo'  
Watch it hit tha flo', watch it hit tha flo'  
  
The way little shorty go I'm trying to think where i should take her  
Watch her hit tha flo', I'm out here spending all this paper  
Bought some cigarillos yeah I blow it by the acre  
If you lookin' this good well shit I wanna meet your maker  
Take her to my home, Say hello to my neighbors  
She my biggest fan, I see her man just trying to save her  
Put it in her mouth, and yeah my taste she's trying to savor  
Shorty saying Khalifa Man should have his own flavor  
Haters wanna be me, but can't walk in my Chuck Taylor's  
All black eleven's, Mac-11 with the laser  
Mami keep on shaking it like she a salt shaker  
Hand on the ground, everybody around.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
A lot of niggas hate, but all the bitches wanna do me  
Wizzle L. Jackson, Yeah my life is like a movie  
Heavy Hustle Gang, Swisher Sweets with the jacuzzi  
Probably fucked your girl, If you don't like it nigga sue me  
Shawty from the hood, but in the club she actin' booshie  
Body like a centerfold, Boy look at that booty  
My ink got her gone, Wanting to know who tattoos me  
Head game right, Just said she'd like to ride (Yeah)  
DJ play my song, When it come on she gets excited  
Before I leave the club, I'll put her number in my sidekick  
Swagger on some different shit, She tell me that she like it  
Watch her break it down, I ain't playin' around.  
  
[Chorus]

Count another grip, smoke another zip  
Let them young niggas tell it I be on my shit  
Make a hundred k, spend it all today  
What can I say, my DNA is Givenchy  
What my swag is, retarded  
What I'm driving, Ferrari  
What I'm rocking, Armani, Gianni, Versace, huh  
Fuck around and I'll buy one of you broke niggas  
My change, insane  
My chain, oh that thing  
  
It's nothing, it's nothing  
It's nothing, it's nothing  
It's nothing, it's nothing  
It's nothing, it's nothing

Go shawty it's your world  
Sub-zero flow, when I spit, I see snow flurries  
Scarface, all out  
All I want in this world  
I mean all I want for lunch, is a blunt, and your girl  
It ain't nothin' to me but it's somethin' to you  
Count money like it's somethin' to do  
Summer time I'm like fuck the roof, winter time I'm in 'Lo boots  
And uh, it's nothin'  
I like being high because it's a better view  
And, I told your ho my chain so cold it's on Theraflu

Don't come out till next year that mean I'm rockin' it  
Order thirty-seven bottles call it poppin' shit  
Goddamn, what you on?  
A private plane, fuck you on?  
Party in south of France when it's cold  
Used to rock all that old shit till it got old

[Verse 1]  
Wake up in the morning, grab my trees and I get to it  
Young nigga, I do my own thing so let me do it  
If you wanna know a thing about me, I'm 'bout my paper  
Fuck a bitch, soon as my iPhone ring I see you later  
Hop on in the Chevy, grab my keys and then I'm outtie  
First thing, If it's 'bout that cheese, then I'm about it  
I be stacking up, got no time for niggas hating  
Low we backing up, keep that clean and watch some Daytons  
Cruising down the street, hear my car before it's coming  
Fuck the police, windows down, I'm smoking something  
And my bitch bad, she gon' ride If shit get crazy  
Goons messed up, they gon' slide you try to play me  
Since a young nigga, kept that pack up in the telly  
Since a young nigga, been had tats like Makaveli  
Shoot for fun nigga  
My niggas bust, you better run nigga  
King of fucking everything  
  
[Hook]  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Young rich nigga, smoking weed when I wanna (x4)  
  
[Verse 2]  
When I touch down, have that pack, you fucking with me  
Fuck the bitch once, she talkin' about she love with me  
Let her smoke weed, drink champagne, do drugs with me  
We go out of town, dinner at Taos, do clubs with me  
What you niggas think, got more bank than And more ranks  
Smoking weed with some bitches in the club who don't drink  
Talkin' about they get money, they got expensive taste  
So I put it in her mouth and sent 'em both on their way  
I'll be there for one night, don't give a fuck if I stay  
Spent a couple hundred thousand in a couple of days  
Smoke a pound in my suite and then come up with a plate  
Bitch came over to my crib and had a comfortable stay  
She feeling my car, she feeling my chain  
She think I'm a star, I'm feeling the same  
I take her abroad, I fuck her insane  
I'm switching up broads, I'm killing the game  
Long range  
King of fucking everything  
  
[Hook]  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Young rich nigga, smoking weed when I wanna (x4)

Sharing this money and trying to all of niggas up and off them streets  
Used to look up some niggas, but now it all seem that it come down to me  
Make sure my family gon' eat  
Grinding from up underneath  
Now they just say I'm a now they just say I'm a beast  
And now all these haters looking at me pitifully  
Cause I'm the shit, literally  
And I be stuntin' when I ride past my old school

Let it go, let it go homie  
You know we can see through the blinds homie

Don't need to take it on the chin

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa](2x)  
Who trying to make a play  
Who trying to make a play  
Who trying to make a play  
Who trying to make a play  
Woke up drunk as fuck  
Still high from yesterday  
I'm trying to make a play  
I'm trying to make a play  
  
[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]  
Woke up feeling like a star  
Get it in no matter where we are  
She in love with me press buttons up in my car  
My weed smoke hella potent  
Riding and the sunroof open  
Blowing smoke out what they know about  
Being bosses, taking losses  
Pay the cost to fuck that bitch, who got that poke out  
My money ain't slow, got more trees to roll  
Got a son I love to death, I gotta see him grow  
Probably the best you've seen but I be on the low  
Stacking up, rolling marijuana, acting up  
Bitch with me, she be bad as fuck  
Bitches love it, niggas mad at us  
Getting money, that's accurate  
Say they want it but they can't adjust  
Taylor Gang, roll a plane  
  
[Hook](2x)  
  
[Verse 2: J.R. Donato]  
Who trying to pour it(ay, ay)  
Who trying to wake and bake(ay)  
Taylor Gang will break the bank  
Ain't got no time to contemplate  
I say i'm high from yesterday  
Okay i woke up on the mud  
I think i ate a 8th of shrums  
Keep OG Kush up in my lungs(whoa)  
Your hoe will come with us(ay)  
Cause she know we brought the drugs(ay)  
And she looking for some love(ay)  
But let's keep that on the hush(whoa)  
It's hard to find some trust  
Some say it's hard to fuck with us  
That's cause we be on different shit  
Bitch i might pour six up in my Crush  
Ohh that's super super much  
And it's joining super clutch  
Got 5 more just for you to stuff  
Send parents to the store for ice and cups  
I swear they never frighten us  
Hell yeah we always lighting up  
Put that pussy on the plate it's fresh for lunch  
And i pour another 8th to level up  
Probably rolling up  
  
[Hook](2x)

Nigga like me be smokin' while I'm drivin'  
Gettin' higher than the Bee Gee's, sayin' we both just stayin' alive and  
Watchin' the time go by, climbin'  
Told you I did enough hash, to make a mountain  
And you could sit right on your ass, doubtin'  
While I'm somewhere rollin' up grass, going up where the clouds is  
Some niggas say they get so high that I ain't fuckin' wit' 'em  
I say if them niggas get that high man I ain't fuckin' wit' 'em  
Doing nothin' wit' 'em, rollin' up or puffin wit' 'em'  
Goin' on the road, doin' shows or gettin' duckies wit' 'em'  
I been smokin' in my pictures since Myspace  
You niggas extra-curricular, bitch I fly straight  
  
Some niggas try that shit for nothing, but I just tell 'em' to do what they do
(Do what they do)  
So many niggas went down the wrong road, so homie you can too (you can too)  
Just give me weed in my joint and I ain't need it for nothing homie I'm
straight (homie I'm straight)  
The same way I came into the game, If I'm ever going out I'm goin' the same
way  
All I need is Mary Mary Mary I ain't fuckin' with no other drug  
All I need is Mary Mary Mary I ain't fuckin' with no other drug  
All I need is Mary Mary Mary I ain't fuckin' with no other drug  
All I need is Mary Mary Mary I ain't fuckin' with no other drug  
  
Nigga like me be smokin' while I'm rappin'  
And my homies smoke like I smoke so we both just make it happen  
Niggas sayin' they be smokin', they be actin'  
'Cause you ain't yet really smoked unless you smoked one with the captain  
High as fuck, choked up in my cabin  
Got some OG from a fan and it was rolled up in a napkin  
So we Taylored, all my niggas smoke papers  
Never smokin' that bullshit with them fucked up names of them flavors  
I remember puttin' weed in my videos, niggas thought I was insane  
Now every time I turn on a video, I see the exact same thing  
'Cause niggas ain't original, niggas ain't cool  
You niggas ain't got it naw, you niggas just ain't you  
That shit is a problem for a nigga who can't lose  
Lil homie I gotta ball, it's something you can't do  
So suckas hate  
  
Some niggas try that shit for nothing, but I just tell 'em' to do what they do
(Do what they do)  
So many niggas went down the wrong road, so homie you can too (you can too)  
Just give me weed in my joint and I ain't need it for nothing homie I'm
straight (homie I'm straight)  
The same way I came into the game, If I'm ever going out I'm goin' the same
way  
All I need is Mary Mary Mary I ain't fuckin' with no other drug  
All I need is Mary Mary Mary I ain't fuckin' with no other drug  
All I need is Mary Mary Mary I ain't fuckin' with no other drug  
All I need is Mary Mary Mary I ain't fuckin' with no other drug

[Intro]  
  
[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]  
I be overseas, I be in L.A  
I be in the South, trappin' hard all day  
I'm from Pittsburgh, but I be in the Bay  
I be in New York, I be MIA  
I be in Chi-town where they quick to spray  
I be in Detroit where they gettin' paid  
I be overseas, I be in LA  
I be in New York, I be MIA  
  
[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]  
If you know me, you know I'm bout my bread  
I count a hundred million dollars 'fore I go to bed  
I'm smoking OG, I'm drinking champagne  
I'm standing on the couch, just throwing up my damn gang  
I'm out in A town, 'bout to go to Mansion  
My jewelry on so all my dogs is ready for the action  
I'm in my old school, my niggas ridin new  
I'm in the Fountain Bleu like what you tryin' to do  
I brought the whole thing so that's what I'mma smoke  
I spent the whole thing, I'm never going broke  
I'm rocking gold chains, I'm drinking til I croak  
Smokin' 'til I choke, my watch need a vote  
  
[Hook]  
  
[Verse 2: Juicy J]  
On vacation weed in rotation  
Relaxation, trippy nation  
Chasing bands, model chicks  
Look like Sports Illustrated  
I'm getting high as a plane  
With no final destination  
On that gin, on that Hen  
And that lean intoxication  
Rocking dollars, rocking gold  
Money tall like Manute Bol  
In a presidential suite  
With some playmates in a fold  
Niggas out here chasing ass  
When they should be chasing cash  
I be smoking til it's gone  
Juicy J don't waste no gas  
With her legs lift up  
I thought it was a stick up  
Should've seen them hoes that pick up  
Bands hard to lift up  
Yellow diamonds look like a bumble bee  
They call me the money tree  
All these bands on me, I can throw a jamboree  
  
[Hook x2]  
  
[Outro]  
You already know what it is Nigga  
It's that Cabin Fever 2  
Shout out to everybody who got the first Cabin Fever

You're probably on the 2050 tour wit us  
So welcome to that  
It's TGOD man, we smoke footlong joints  
Nothin' but KK and cookies all day

Every time that we hit man, I know y'all in this bitch

When I ride by, I want you to see what I see  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Shit's very clear, uh  
  
[Verse]  
Pass me a joint, guarantee Imma hit it  
Come to that life, I don't talk it, I live it  
I got a old school ass car you can sit in  
I got a crib that you probably can't get in  
I got a pound, we can grind it and twist it  
I been at work on the grind for a minute  
Smokin' that loud and still mindin' my business  
She fuck with me because I got the vision  
Countin' my benjis  
Puttin' it all in the bank but I don't really mind if I spend it  
Can't take it? Don't cross the line when you finish  
When you stay all on your grind you can get it  
When we be fuckin' I'm climbin' up in it  
She fuck with me because I got the vision  
Haters be talkin', don't mind 'em, don't listen  
Duckin' 'em shots, that's divine intervention  
I be so high, try me, come visit  
You make a choice, hope you like your decision  
Come to my crib, we can spark and get lifted  
Go up in smoke just like I'm a magician  
Ain't fuck with me then she probably was trippin'  
Lightin' 'em up just like we electricians  
Get to this money, get high, my intentions  
Roll me one up that's as loud as the engine  
She fuck with me because I got the vision  
I fuck with her, when I'm talkin', she listen  
When we together, we stick to the mission  
Sparkin' that weed up without no permission  
She fuck with me because I got the vision  
I fuck with her, when I'm talkin', she listen  
When we together, we stick to the mission  
Rollin' that weed up without no permission, uh  
  
[Outro]  
Oh, oh, money come and money go, we stay the same though  
Oh, oh, money come and money go, we stay the same though

Waking up in the morning, two hoes laying next to me

They just paying enough  
Man them niggas ain't ballin' they just laying it up  
Saying they does, I'm just rolling hella weed up  
While on my way to the club

But now I don't cause everything is on me

Drinkin' out the bottle, smiling in all my pictures  
The marijuana loud so them hoes follow like twitter  
nigga, you know everything tailored  
Don't rush to the bar fool, if you ain't got no paper  
That's the rules, high as fuck, sloppy drunk when I'm passing through  
Rollin' doobies up, ya hoe who we pass 'em to  
Hit the club spend this money up, roll another one, drink, act a fool  
That's what I have to do  
  
[Chorus]  
See after drinking champagne all night  
Never worry bout a damn thing, y'all might  
Homie I'm on my level, yeah  
I'm on my level, yeah  
I'm on my level, yeah  
I'm on my level, yeah  
So I'mma take one shot to the brain  
And I order three more shots  
I'm going in, aye  
I'm on my level, yeah  
I'm on my level, yeah  
I'm on my level, yeah  
I'm on my level, yeah  
  
Spent a couple dollars on my engine  
motor roaring when I back out the garage  
Gin got me drunk as fuck stumbling out the bar  
Plus I'm struggling tryna find the keys to my car  
'Cause I be going hard, roll the camera  
Life just like a movie I'm the star  
Wish you was in my position  
You too broke to play the part  
Of course I keep some bad women with me in the back  
Sippin' Rose with some hash twistin'  
All about a dollar, my team in the cash gettin'  
Straight out the burg,' where we drink and we smash niggas  
So when I say I'm balling, that don't mean that I'm playing mayne  
All my diamonds talkin', you can see what they sayin' mayne  
  
[Chorus]  
  
In the middle of the night, early in the mornin'  
From the streets to the sheets with some freaks, I ain't yawnin'  
I'm wide awake, we ain't eatin' and we ain't sleepin'  
These bitches so high man, we ain't even speakin'  
We just freakin'  
You rollin' with short dog baby  
She was high on that pill so I fucked yo lady  
Come to my house I give 'em everything they want  
I might not dot it, but I give to ya women  
Cocaine, mushrooms, ecstasy, G.H.B., Marijuana  
She can suck it if she wanna  
I got tequila, Ciroc and two freaky friends  
And this a Wednesday night, this ain't the weekend!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Man I'm high as fuck  
Man I swear I'm on my level  
Man I'm sloppy drunk  
Man I swear I'm on my level  
I finna pass out  
man I swear I'm on my level  
A nigga get smashed out  
My6 nig' I swear I'm on my level  
  
Man I'm high as fuck  
Man I swear I'm on my level  
Man I'm sloppy drunk  
Man I swear I'm on my level  
I finna pass out  
man I swear I'm on my level  
A hater gettin' smashed out  
Man I swear I'm on my level  
  
[Chorus]

Uh, you would have thought that from seeing me going hard  
That that'd motivate these motherfuckers to get on they job  
But instead they hating on what I've been doing  
Having conversations in my face about what I should do for 'em  
What I'mma do keep rolling and dropping weed on 'em  
Pack my bags look like I'm staying for weeks but be gone in the morning  
If the flight is private, we probably should board it  
You see it you like it, I can probably afford it  
If niggas really felt some type of way about the shit I'm doing  
You picked a crazy time to start letting me know  
Cause jealousy and envy that's a trait for mostly bitches  
Not a man so you ain't one if you letting it show  
Now the money like the weed how we letting it grow  
And I ain't holding on to shit I'm letting it go  
Started small but now we all in them bigger game  
All in a bigger plane, ballin' and getting paid  
  
First the love was there  
Then the paper came  
Then the haters came  
But we still rise above  
  
First the love was there  
Then the paper came  
Then the haters came  
But we still rise above  
  
My phone is dead, but I got a contact  
My sharpie paint pen on my Timbo combats  
You talk shit, I won't respond back  
What they gon' get, and you don't want that  
That nigga will forget the deal  
Remember what? get for real  
My whip appeal, my crib is real  
My wrist as well you know...the Richard Mille  
And my grunge nigga, I make her come quicker  
Then rock toe socks, yellow sponge nigga  
I Tebow, for hoes that eat hoes  
Emojis fo' me and my people  
The hoes love me, I'm on they TiVo  
I work they thighs, and they kegels  
Skateboard, I love Chanel  
Retweet me bitch, I'm Pharrell  
  
First the love was there  
Then the paper came  
Then the haters came  
But we still rise above  
  
First the love was there  
Then the paper came  
Then the haters came  
But we still rise above  
  
Yeah, I hustle no muscle  
I'll never be muzzled  
I'm a piece to a puzzle  
I'm Robert Townsend and my words gon' Hollywood Shuffle  
My nigga I move moo, my motivation is moves foo'  
I get up and does do, I evenly do ten things at once  
Multitaskin' super fast and king of tattin' super pimpin'  
House of rollin' run a business while I'm tourin' on you bitches  
Doing features while watching a double feature nigga  
I see you suffering from haterism, get that check  
I take nothin' and make somethin' there's no breaks when the hustle's runnin'  
Ain't dealin' with fakes ain't fuckin' with snakes  
They all in my face now they got what it takes my nigga I'm straight  
So don't reach out cause I peaced out when I reached out  
There's no response like knockin' on an empty house  
Yeah, so I keep on while you peep on what I be on and you're behind  
That's what karma's about  
  
First the love was there  
Then the paper came  
Then the haters came  
But we still rise above  
  
First the love was there  
Then the paper came  
Then the haters came  
But we still rise above  
  
Man what the fuck is wrong with these niggas  
They rollin' up, let alone doin' a song with these niggas  
Claimin' they ballin', to me they playin'  
These niggas ain't really doin' what they sayin'

When you at home that's your man,  
Soon as you land you say that's all me  
'Cause shit ain't all G with him no more, you ain't entertained

But on the real you're so obvious  
And if you keep fitting me in your plans and fuckin' up,  
Your mans gonna catch onto us  
That white sand surrounding us  
He be handcuffing, he should work for them officers  
If you rolling I got a spot  
Where I can put you on this medical,  
And send you home doctored up  
You wanna ride with me 'cause you say that he boring  
Wake up you rollin' weed, cooking eggs in the morning  
Ain't scared to spend this money I'll make more of it  
First you was in the sky now you say you in orbit  
  
[Chorus]  
  
No matter where I am  
No matter where you are

'Cause I was there from the start  
No matter if I'm near  
Don't matter if your far

And I'll be there when you call

It's been a long day without you my friend  
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again  
We've come a long way from where we began  
Oh I'll tell you all about it when I see you again  
When I see you again  
  
Damn who knew all the planes we flew  
Good things we've been through  
That I'll be standing right here  
Talking to you about another path I  
Know we loved to hit the road and laugh  
But something told me that it wouldn't last  
Had to switch up look at things different see the bigger picture  
Those were the days hard work forever pays now I see you in a better place  
  
How could we not talk about family when family's all that we got?  
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side  
And now you gonna be with me for the last ride  
  
It's been a long day without you my friend  
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again  
We've come a long way from where we began  
Oh I'll tell you all about it when I see you again  
when I see you again  
  
First you both go out your way  
And the vibe is feeling strong and what's  
Small turn to a friendship, a friendship  
Turn into a bond and that bond will never  
Be broken and the love will never get lost  
And when brotherhood come first then the line  
Will never be crossed established it on our own  
When that line had to be drawn and that line is what  
We reach so remember me when I'm gone  
  
How could we not talk about family when family's all that we got?  
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side  
And now you gonna be with me for the last ride  
  
So let the light guide your way hold every memory  
As you go and every road you take will always lead you home  
  
It's been a long day without you my friend  
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again  
We've come a long way from where we began  
Oh I'll tell you all about it when I see you again  
When I see you again

Yeah  
Ugh  
Ugh  
Ugh  
  
See I've been going on and on forever  
Them haters probably wonder when I'm gone stop, never  
Most of it's been good but I've seen some bad weather  
And niggas watching now, wouldn't even give me an umbrella  
But I ain't tripping, I made a million on my own  
May come to your surprise but I pictured it all along  
When I was sixteen, finna get put out my home  
Now the man make the money, my nigga, my money grown  
And I can do what I what, went form being hated on  
To niggas try to go down the same road I made it on  
Ain't no love lost but ain't no love shown  
So now when niggas call I just don't pick up the phone  
I'm breaking down the weed, put it in the bong  
Blow a hundred racks, put it in the song  
Party every weekend, hardly ever home  
Don't get a chance to see me face to face  
So you have to talk about me when I gone  
  
[Chorus]  
Stay away from the fake or phony (phony)  
Niggas who can't support their role  
So keep hatin' me from the crowd  
Everybody wants to be the star of the show-ow-ow  
The show-ow-ow (ow-ow)  
The show-ow-ow (ow-ow)  
The show-ow-ow (ow-ow)  
The show-ow-ow (ow-ow)  
  
The drinks poured up, weed's rolled up  
And all my jewelery ice age the piece froze up  
I only like to see the hoes who keep their nose up  
Have any nigga in the world but she chose us  
I remember them same hoes ain't even notice us  
Get you to buy a drink than its over cous'  
We back around the time that she sober'd up  
But shit ain't been the same since the limousine showed up  
The best moments of my life  
Never filled this much plastic off of Polo in my life  
Rarely gon' to see, smoking with ya wife  
Plus anything you want I can afford to buy it twice  
It's the way we know, wake up in the morn'  
Like "where did all my paper go"  
Roll some more weed and get medicated  
Everyday is a holiday so we celebrate it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Niggas losing their roles  
Can't play they positions (play they positions)  
One day they down for the team (team)  
Next day they missin' (Next day they missin')  
Same ones was all in the front  
Supposed to be there for support (there for support)  
And half the time it's the ones you care for  
Fuck you here for, huh?  
You wanna be a, big shot, only number one  
Everybody wanna be a superstar  
Big shot, only number one  
But everybody wanna be the star though  
They wanna be a big shot, only number one  
Everybody wanna be a superstar  
Big shot, only number one  
But everybody wanna be the star though  
Ugh  
The money come, the money go  
And when it come down to it  
That's something niggas with real money should know  
We partied a lot, and drank  
Now they don't talk to me  
Started off not so great, now I'm on top of things  
  
I guess the difference is we ain't thinking the same  
So if I'm guilty of change, I guess I'm the one to blame  
I see the bigger picture on the wall in the frame  
Spent a couple of days on team making it rain  
I was cool but, I was thinking ocean views  
Polo trunk shades on and boat shoes  
Cantox lick oil, my nigga I ain't slippin'  
You won't star me out, ugh bad transmission  
So if for the better, yeah a nigga different  
That west coast weed, my homie Wiz twistin'  
Mattress money put up 'cause now my money different  
You got a lot to say, but they ain't never tried to listen  
Record all night in the studio in the morn  
Playin' back when we did, now tell me is that wrong  
Crack the Rose, pop a top or two  
And toast to what this hard work got us to

Yeah  
It's nothing new  
'Cause this is exactly what I do  
What up E, haha  
The good weeds lit on this one, yeah  
Riding by myself  
  
The world turning, the weed burning  
Them haters talking, I keep earning  
Know some will say that life's a bitch  
Well I'ma flirtin' and fuck that bitch for the money and Louie V purchases  
Old folks jock my car 'cause they know just what this is  
Niggas felxin' hard with no bars, they got weak servants  
Keep verses, Mortal Kombat  
Look at my ring, if I ain't ballin' bitch then what you call that  
Nothing but net, ain't back 'cause I never left  
I did everything right nigga better yet  
Rolling bomb for the niggas that's around us  
Something like a contractor building from the ground up  
Now just, oh  
Twist up this weed  
Realize that you are in the presence of a G  
Don't fuck up my paper meaning my cheese  
Or the ones I use to roll up my trees  
Fuck it, you know what I mean  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm riding round, smoking, my music up loud  
Kinda doin' my thing, no disrespect to the niggas before me  
Some smile up in your face but then they don't on the low  
Now I just stunt on my own  
Now I just stunt on my own  
I'm in a race, and taking the winners place  
No foot on the brakes  
One the best, homie that's what they call me  
It's lonely at the top, got no company so  
Now I just stunt on my own  
Now I just stunt on my own  
  
See me, when I'm alone, wishing they could fuck with me  
My ex calling my phone, wishing she could stunt with me  
But I'm just riding dog, doing a buck fifty  
Stunting like Jet Li, boat houses and Jet Ski's  
Thirty on the flight, ice like the Gretsky's  
My dime piece only recognize the best tree's  
Treat 'em like I don't need 'em boy, you best believe  
You in her face (You in her face)  
I let her breath  
  
From debated on, to waited on  
From hated on, to the nigga they put cake up on  
Cause we are,  
Young movie stars  
Cause we are,  
Young movie stars  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)  
(Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)  
(Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)  
(Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)  
  
Oh-ooh-oh, now I just stunt on my own  
Bitches ain't say shit to me  
But now they won't leave me alone  
Used to walk the other way  
But now they all come to my home  
And they calling my phone,  
'Cause my paper is long  
Heard nothing, but they singing my songs  
Get hired up, if they want than I bring them along  
We flying up, no you wont need a ticket at all  
Need a ticket at all  
Tell 'em bitch I'ma ball and I'ma buy a new crib for my niggas 'n' all  
'Cause I remember days we'd sit and picture it all  
Nigga swear I'd leave or pictured I'd fall  
Counting reasons why they hate, your bitch think I'm a star  
Cause we are, young, gifted,  
Not to mention out here making motherfucking millions  
Yeah, I said it, motherfucking millions  
Got my money up, I'm in the building  
Yup  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)  
(Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
