A thousand puppets  
Waiting for a call  
A thousand puppets  
Afraid to fall  
  
Try to walk, try to dance  
Try to talk and wanna get their chance  
One guy stands over there  
He pretends to go somewhere  
He shouts out  
  
Follow me  
Only then you will see  
What's it all, all about  
Only then you will see  
What's it all, all about  
Hey you there, stop to shout  
Stop to shout  
  
Follow me and my advice  
Stop to think  
Ain't this nice?  
I will tell you what to do  
If you let me count for you  
Un, deux, trois  
  
Follow me and my advice  
Stop to think  
Ain't this nice?  
I will tell you what to do  
If you let me count for you  
Stop to shout  
Stop to shout  
  
I prefer to lose my mind  
Not knowing what to do  
Through your eyes I will be blind  
Through your eyes and you  
I don't wanna learn  
Learn your dance  
I don't care for this advance  
I don't wanna learn your dance  
I don't care for this advance  
  
That's for now the one defense  
Not to be caught behind your fence  
I prefer to be a freak  
And the world might call me weak  
If you give me immediate sense  
I know I move behind your fence [Repeat: x3]

The age of science has failed  
To explain our universe in rational terms.  
  
Consequently the power of magic  
Has gradually emerged from our conscious minds  
To fathom the unfathomable.  
  
Our most distinguished scientists  
Reluctantly admit that mankind is nothing  
But some billion creatures,  
Sitting on a piece of solar driftwood floating in space.  
  
Magic is the art of influencing the course  
Of events by the intervention  
Of spiritual forces or some other occult device.  
  
According to Arthur C. Clarke  
Any sufficiently advanced technology  
Is indistinguishable from magic.  
  
Early civilization often mistook  
The unexplainable world around them to be magic.  
  
Rupert Sheldrake in his book  
Seven experiments that could change the world  
Has stated that scientists' attitude  
Toward their experiments affect  
The results of their experiments.  
  
There is no such thing as a definite  
Fact in science and therefore the irrationality of magic  
Plays an important part in our rational world.  
  
Werner Heisenberg, the leading 20th century  
Physicist has stated that mass  
Is a physical interpretation of energy.  
  
Religious organizations have understood the power of magic  
And therefore monopolized the interpretation  
Of the supernatural to control the human mind.  
  
The universe as a whole is beyond explanation.  
  
Only at the end of the 20th. century  
The Roman-Catholic Church admitted,  
That the great visionary Galileo Galilei was in fact correct.  
  
The second millennium has come to an end.  
Scientists have to admit that the universe is magic.

Just a smile of her hips  
And a sip of my glass  
And let's go  
  
She looked in my eyes  
No need for this ride  
She's a queen  
She's pristine  
And a slave  
  
With a smile of her hips  
She was changing my life  
We are heading downtown in her car  
Her ride is too smooth  
No line [light?] for a stop  
My blenders are flying too far

Your dancing drives me crazy  
I want to see it all night long  
DJ could be playing  
Always this one song  
Your dancing drives me crazy  
Your dancing drives me mad  
Please Sue don't be so lazy  
If you don't dance I'm sad  
  
I want to see you moving  
And dancing all the night  
  
The way that Sue is moving  
Is nothing but divine  
And only in the disco  
I know she can be mine  
And when the night is over  
The club is closing down  
I want to give her anything I got  
I give her just a crown  
  
I want to see you moving  
And dancing all the night  
  
I'm not here for the music  
Or for your eyes so blue  
I got to see you dancing  
To be in love with you  
I want to get my Daily Disco  
Watch you all the night  
I want to get my Daily Disco  
Did you get that Sue all right  
  
I want to see you moving  
And dancing all the night  
  
Hey you  
I want to see your dance  
Cause you're the only one  
And when you dance  
I know you're mine  
I want to see your dance  
I want it all night long  
Oh Sue you're so divine  
  
Hey you  
Another night is gone  
Another day is back  
I am walking home and feel all right  
Sun in my eyes  
One thing in my mind  
I hope to see you Sue tonight  
  
My name is Clinch Dedee  
You're the only one I want to see  
You're the only one I want to dance  
I'm one of your fans  
I'm one of your fans  
  
I want to see you moving  
Dancing all the night  
Don't come any closer  
It's damaging my sight  
It's damaging my sight

I never meet her in the city  
But believe me she is pretty  
Six-hundred-fifty miles away  
I meet my angel in the desert  
In the desert I can meet her  
Oh in the desert heat she makes me play  
  
I'm not trying to be clever  
I'm not getting there forever  
Only flying with the wind and thee  
I'm not trying to be late  
Just becoming a slave  
Come on angel, play the game  
  
I'm not trying to be clever  
I'm not getting there forever  
Won't fight with the window on me  
I'm not trying to be late  
Just becoming a slave  
Come on angel, play the game  
  
She's never in the city  
But the woman she's pretty  
Six-hundred-fifty miles away  
I meet my angel in the desert  
In the desert I can meet her  
In the desert heat she makes me pray  
  
There is a race in your face

I'm walkin' downtown  
No lookin' around  
'Cause I'm a fool and a half  
Blessed and beaten by love  
  
I walk in the direction  
But then I stop the action  
'Cause when I try to do it  
My heart is gone, I blew it  
  
Do it, do it...  
  
I'm going on and on, just on and on  
Just walkin', talkin', not a winner at all  
I'm boozing, losing, getting out of control  
She dances hip-hop, she's on the top  
I'm still a fool and a half, blessed and beaten by love  
  
Do it, do it...  
  
I'm walkin' back home  
Keep lookin' around  
Still a fool and a half  
Blessed and beaten by love  
  
She walks in my direction  
Why don't she start the action  
I got no guts to do it  
And then she's gone, I blew it  
  
Do it, do it...

We are here  
In this holy cave today  
To celebrate  
The reincarnation  
Of Domingo de Santa Clara  
The man who convinced us  
That there is no Lord  
For His name is Buddha, Allah, Shiva, Jahve  
Outside our bodies  
  
We are God  
'Cause only we can create the idea  
Of His existence in our holy brains  
  
Let us pray to ourselves and our spirits!  
  
Domingo you show me just nothing  
Like no one before  
Domingo you show me just nothing  
Like no one before  
Domingo you show me just nothing  
Like no one before  
Domingo you show me just nothing  
Like no one before  
  
Domingo of Santa Clara  
You made us believe  
That you are no phantom  
When without  
  
The slightest spot of a thousand nations  
You sprayed your blood of Domingo  
  
We all know  
Domingo of Santa Clara  
Will be born today, tomorrow, and the day after  
  
Billions of times  
'Til the end of the Universe  
Here with a smile on his face  
As the rest of our species watches  
The catastrophe  
  
Domingo you show me just nothing  
Like no one before  
Domingo you show me just nothing  
Like no one before  
Domingo you show me just nothing  
Like no one before

This one's called  
Now for you  
Downtown samba  
  
Canal Street's where we dance  
We do the rhumba, samba  
The city's hot, we're almost naked

Night's still young  
We do the samba with the congo warrior  
  
Downtown samba

Go go go for sambo  
Dancing, dancing, dancing  
Tango

Come see, you'll see  
So dance the tango, tango

I can't separate your fiction from fact  
You're lost, I know you're trying to wind your way back  
You've been talking as fast as you can  
I'm not listening anymore  
  
Now baby  
You're changing all the rules  
You're taking advantage of a fool  
  
Good evening  
I'm Ed Burroughs  
And the name of this show is "Person To Person"  
Tonight we're visiting the home of a very famous motion picture  
And television director  
Dr. Van Steiner, I'm very sorry I'm unable to attend this tremendous  
Occasion being given in your honor  
I would like to extend my sincerest best wishes to you

Across the space  
We fly around the world  
For years, years, years, years,  
  
We're out of control  
Inside an iron ball  
Desire  
  
[Chorus]  
We see the moon  
A color ball  
We won't be free again  
No choice  
  
An iron box  
Electric brain release  
Away, away, away, away  
  
A piece of steel  
That's all we ever feel  
No pain  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Desire  
We see the moon  
A color ball  
We won't be free again

I want to be yours, I want to be loved  
Giving, loving, rolling, revving ?  
The rhythm divine  
Giving, loving, rolling, revving ?  
The rhythm divine  
  
When I saw you the first time  
I knew it was a fine line  
And when I saw you the last time  
You made me,  
Stop my game, forget my name  
I want to be yours  
  
I want to be yours, I want to be loved  
Stop my game, forget my name  
  
Giving, loving, rolling, revving ?  
The rhythm divine  
Stop my game, forget my name  
  
I want to be yours, I want to be loved

Give me your gold  
  
Blue moon is walking  
These lips are smoking  
Big time disaster  
My heart gets faster  
My pot is melting  
Doctors consulting destiny  
Give it to me  
  
This is  
Your show and it's old  
And it's a wonder  
This day I give it to you  
Give it to you  
  
Give me your gold  
Give me your gold  
  
You got a nugget in your pocket  
Got a nugget in your hand  
You got a nugget in your pocket  
Got a nugget for a grand  
So forget your hesitation  
Take a dozen invitation  
Like it's for a great confusion  
Like it's for a grand illusion  
  
Clouds  
Love  
Stars  
Colors  
  
Take it into the night

The jungle near Manaus  
The Amazonas full of piranhas  
The birds of paradise  
Disappear into the green desert  
For years and years  
We are hungry and desperate  
For the only thing worth living  
The excess  
We end our Great Mission  
Exhausted and sad  
And there is no hope left  
When suddenly  
In a cloud of golden smog  
The father of excess  
Jumps out of the water of  
The Amazonas full of piranhas  
And screams to the lost souls  
  
What are you doing at the Amazonas  
Leave Manaus full of piranhas [burp!]  
You will not find excess in the jungle  
  
And then  
He opened the green curtain  
Made of fleshy leaves and said  
  
I show you the excess of the  
Asphalt a Montmartre  
The excess of the belly-dance  
In Abu Dhabi  
And the excess of the everlasting night in Manhattan [burp!]  
  
Are you ready for the sensation del tango a Rosario?  
Leave him, the gorilla  
Leave the jungle of the Amazonas  
Leave Manaus full of piranhas  
And follow father excess.

My life is in a serious mess,  
My baby is gone, there's heavy mental stress  
I never knew love but I know it now,  
I want to give her my heart, but how how  
  
I never knew love but I know it now,  
I want to give her my heart, but how how  
How How  
  
Maybe I should buy her a beautiful dress,  
Maybe gold and diamonds, and no more stress  
I decide to call her, it drives me insane,  
Then she's on the line and tells me "Don't be vain"  
  
I decide to call her, it drives me insane,  
But then she's on the line and tells me I take the blame  
You ? little fool and you know what I miss,  
No diamonds, no gold, just a kiss  
Just a kiss  
  
I got nothing to lose so I know it doesn't matter,  
I do it the old way and write her a letter  
I know how much I love you and I need you now,  
You're the one and only and you tell me how  
  
Now I'm out of trouble and a serious mess,

Sunday night  
I was riding on the a train  
Reading the newspaper  
A woman was trying to convince a man  
That she hadn't done it  
  
All these years  
I haven't seen you  
Love is still the same  
Now you must believe me  
Now I play no game  
I know I loved you  
When I left you  
Couldn't tell you why  
Too sad today  
Too sad for tears  
Let me cry  
  
You only just caught that train  
Breathless  
And then, you smiled at me  
We left, on canal street, and uh  
Had a drink at  
Remember the name of the place?  
  
All these years  
I haven't seen you  
Love is still the same  
Now you must believe me  
Now I play no games  
I know I loved you  
When I left you  
Couldn't tell you why  
Too sad today  
Too sad for tears  
Let me cry  
  
Yes, I do remember  
The name of the place  
Three roses

Only in your arms I'm lost  
Don't look at me

You give me love  
You give me fire  
You give me more  
Give me desire  
  
You give me love  
You give me fire  
You give me more  
Give me desire  
  
You give me love  
You give me fire  
You give me more  
Give me desire  
  
You give me love  
You give me fire  
You give me more  
Give me desire  
  
You give me fire  
  
Love  
Escape  
Rhythm  
Fever  
  
You give me fire  
  
Give me desire  
  
I see your eyes  
I can't escape  
A serious case  
  
Fever  
Fever  
Fever  
Fever  
  
You give me love  
You give me fire  
You give me more  
Give me desire  
  
You give me love  
You give me fire  
You give me more  
Give me desire

I wake up in the evening  
The sun is still around  
The street seems to be busy  
I hear the traffic sounds  
  
Last night's been lousy  
I had a lot to drink  
Too many dry martinis  
And cans of beer to sink  
  
Another day, already night  
Blue neon light  
Blue neon light  
  
I could call my Rhianna  
Ask her to meet me now  
I think I lost her number  
It's too late anyhow  
I could turn on the TV  
Or I could stay in bed  
  
These Asians drive me crazy  
These Asians drive me mad  
  
Another day, already night  
Blue neon light  
Blue neon light  
  
Night is near  
I'm still in bed  
Red curtain  
Soft wind  
Sunlight  
And I was red  
  
On the papers  
On the floor  
We did watch possessed  
  
People, push and pull it  
Moss turf, and other lads  
My head's still full of poison  
What I do is insane  
I should, perhaps, move out of here  
Or take a plane to Spain  
  
Refrigerator's noise  
I'll get out, the only choice  
Should I get up right now  
Wait for me somehow  
Don't want to know what for  
To get out of this door  
Should I phone Debbie Meier?  
Is this the one desire?  
I look into the mirror  
My eyes can't be in error  
The sun's now really gone  
Perhaps I am the one  
Nothing can creep in sight  
I'm turning on the lights  
  
Turning on the lights  
I'm turning on the lights (5x)  
  
The sun's now really gone  
Perhaps I am the one

I'm riding the night train  
The smile is still burning  
Dancing my way  
?  
A crown for the clown, I smile, and I run  
  
For years now I'm driven  
A smile, unforgiven  
I'm dancing with strangers  
?  
Awaiting your big smile,  
I'm rushing downtown while you're gone  
For years now I'm driven, a smile unforgiven, the one  
  
I'm riding the night train  
The window's a mirror  
I'm dancing with strangers  
I'm waiting...for you  
  
Awaiting your big smile,  
I'm rushing downtown while you're gone  
For years now I'm driven, a smile unforgiven, the one  
A crown for the clown, a smiling crowd, and you're gone  
For years now I'm driven, a smile unforgiven, the one

Her name was Julie  
When she took me on a ride in her old Chevrolet  
Straight into a dusty sundown  
I knew she was gonna make up one of her stories  
And then she couldn't believe that I told her  
How much I love her lies and how much I love her games  
  
Riding on the highway  
You're going much too far  
You're lying so much better  
When you drive a car  
You're lying 'til the sundown  
So look into my face  
You're lying (I love it)  
You're lying (I love it)  
You're lying (I love it)  
You're lying (I love it)  
You're lying  
  
I love your games  
I love your lies  
I love your games  
Look in my eyes  
Don't believe I'm worried  
When you're playing all these games  
I love your lies just hold me tight  
I got no one to blame  
You're lying, I'm buying  
I'm buying every word  
I love your lies  
I love your games  
  
Take me to the ballroom  
We're dancing through the night  
I'm in your arms, I love your lies  
They make me feel so light  
You're lying to your shadow  
So look into my face  
You're lying (I love it)  
You're lying (I love it)  
You're lying (I love it)  
You're lying (I love it)  
You're lying  
  
Julie stopped her car  
The sun had gone and left one of these dark red skies  
She looked in my eyes and with a smile in her face she said  
"Of Course I'm Lying.  
But I think I love you."  
  
Take me on the highway  
You're going much too far  
You're lying even better  
When you drive a car  
You're lying 'til the sundown  
So look into my face  
You're lying (I love it)  
You're lying (I love it)  
You're lying (I love it)  
You're lying (I love it)  
You're lying  
  
I love your games  
I love your lies  
I love your games  
Look in my eyes  
Take me in your arms and hold me tight just for tonight  
I need no drugs I love your lies  
You hide me from the night  
You're lying, I'm buying  
I'm buying every word  
I love your lies  
I love your games

Waiting for the lady in the red balloon  
Putz dada sheoba sleik dabich  
Looking for a groove she stares at me, that witch  
  
Dynamite  
  
Poud karoud sheoba diba duglak  
Leather and lace, she's wearing black  
Poud karoub sheoba diba diboum  
Believe it or not, she doesn't know my name  
  
Dynamite

She's spinning circles around my balloon  
Putz karam sheoba kitsch daboum  
She's dynamite the lady and that's unfair  
I'm stuck in my balloon, stuck in the air
