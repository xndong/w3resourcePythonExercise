Right, let's get the whole thing cooking)  
  
I try to run in a different race  
But every time I seem to loose face  
Making it hard it's easy  
But I got to keep trying to lessen my pace  
  
I try to walk down a city-street  
I say hello to the people I meet  
They're walking their way and thinking I'm crazy  
But I have so much trouble just to keeping the beat  
  
Well my way of life is simple  
'Cause I just do what I please  
Whatever I was blessing  
Well it worn't to laugh at me  
  
Maybe I'm just a country boy  
Hinging life bringing no joy  
Well it's bringing me down, it's making me lonely  
You see I'm fooling with a life and it ain't no toy  
  
Well my way of life is simple  
'Cause I just do what I please  
And whenever I got problems  
I just call upon Aries  
  
Here she comes  
Here she comes

All of my life I felt that you were listening  
Watching for ways to help me stay in tune  
Lord of my dreams, although confusion  
Keeps trying to deceive  
What is it that makes me believe in you?  
  
Babaji, oh won't you come to me  
Won't you help me face the music  
Bring it out so we can sing it out  
Help me to find it before we lose it  
  
At night when the stars are near  
And there's no one to keep you from coming here  
And there's no one to shield me before your eyes  
Is it mine, is it mine, is it mine to know?  
  
I can see it's not too good to me  
To be afloat in the sea of glory  
Babaji, oh how you comfort me  
By showing me it's a different story  
  
Your light in the dark is real  
And I know that you know it is how I feel  
When I see the reflections that's in your eyes  
Is it mine, is it mine, is it mine to know?  
  
Babaji, have you a song for me  
To tell the world of its guardian angel  
Bring it out so we can sing it out  
Oh must you always remain a stranger?  
  
At night when the stars are near  
And I long for delusion to disappear  
The I see the reflection that's in your eyes  
Is it time, is it time, is it time to know

Trust me, I can help you  
Feel free, we can save you  
Join us in the good life  
And better days, better days  
  
Campaign for a new life  
Champagne and the bright lights  
Make way for the right way  
And better days, better days  
  
You didn't realize about the other life that we can give you  
We'll open up your eyes and make you see the light that's all around you  
We'll help you work it out and then you'll never doubt  
Our intuition, our vision, our decision, our mission, so listen  
  
No war, no inflation  
No more desperation  
You'll see we can show you  
Better days, better days  
  
More food, higher wages  
Good schools, smiling faces  
Make way for the new way  
Better days, better days  
  
We're going to lead you down to where the sun is always brightly shining  
We'll push away the clouds and show you there's a gold and silver lining  
We'll take away the pain, you'll want to try again  
You won't be sorry, so don't worry, don't worry, so hurry and join me

Take a look at my girlfriend  
She's the only one I got  
Not much of a girlfriend  
Never seem to get a lot  
  
Take a jumbo across the water  
Like to see America  
See the girls in California  
I'm hoping it's going to come true  
But there's not a lot I can do  
  
Could we have kippers for breakfast  
Mummy dear, Mummy dear  
They got to have 'em in Texas  
Cos everyone's a millionaire  
  
I'm a winner, I'm a sinner  
Do you want my autograph  
I'm a loser, what a joker  
I'm playing my jokes upon you  
While there's nothing better to do  
  
Don't you look at my girlfriend  
She's the only one I got  
Not much of a girlfriend  
Never seem to get a lot  
  
Take a jumbo cross the water  
Like to see America  
See the girls in California  
I'm hoping it's going to come true  
But there's not a lot I can do

You make me nervous when you're flying around  
The secret service couldn't track you down  
You tell me no then you kiss me  
You say hello then you ditch me  
You try to run when you see me  
  
I never knew what this dream was about  
You say let's go then you're lost in the crowd  
I don't know where you're going  
You won't show then you're showing  
I don't know then I'm knowing  
  
You're always busy when I call on the phone

(Stop stop)  
Snakes alive why you grievin'  
It's six to five and I'm leavin'

There's a red cloud hanging over us  
And it's so big and it's gonna burst  
All you people with your heads in the ground  
Hey brother, where you bound?  
  
And they're no good and they're everywhere  
Try to tell you, but you just don't care  
Try to hear you but you don't make a sound  
Hey brother, where you bound?  
Hey brother, where you bound?  
  
And you don't know what they're gonna do  
And you don't know how they feel  
And you don't know what they're tellin' you  
Is it a lie or is it real  
And the next thing that you know is  
That they walk out on the deal  
  
And the message that they're giving you  
Is the same old alibi  
If you don't quite see their point of view  
Then they treat you like a spy  
And the phone rings and you disappear  
In the middle of the night  
  
Can't you see they're on the move  
Don't know what you're trying to prove  
But you sit there oh so cool  
Like they never broke no rules  
  
And the cat flies and the crow walks  
And the ghost dies and the sow talks  
And they tell us that they'll be good as gold  
Be...'lieve nothing that you're told  
Hey brother, where's your soul?  
  
Make a move in one direction  
Try to make some compromise  
But they greet you with rejection  
Makin' out you're tellin' lies  
Then they turn around and tell you  
Better get down from the sky  
  
For the sake of all that's holy  
Listen good to what I say  
I can feel them all around me  
They could be here any day  
But you act like you don't know me  
Why d' you look at me that way  
  
If there's one thing that is clear  
We gotta get away from here  
We've gotta leave this place  
It's just a hopeless case  
Ain't no one else to blame  
We're gonna lose this game  
  
Hey brother get off my back  
I gotta tell you, you're way off the track  
They got a hatred deep down inside  
Ain't gonna let them take me alive  
  
I'm gonna burn them down, just wait and see  
Ain't gonna let them walk over me  
Boy you ain't got no heart and soul  
And your mind is weak and your blood's runnin' cold  
  
You better move, you better hide  
They're gettin' in, they're gettin' inside  
If you get caught you better know  
They're gonna reap, you're gonna sow  
  
Don't be a fool, we gotta go  
Ain't no place safe for us to stay  
We better move on, we better move on

You're tellin' lies, so don't you criticize  
Yeah I got used, all messed up and abused  
You let me down, with all your runnin' round  
Still you pretend and try to call me friend  
  
Don't say a word, I know just what I heard  
Yeah you've been loose, you just got no excuse  
Just feel my rage, why can't you come of age?  
I felt it all, just like a cannonball  
  
Then you got mad, you said that I'm all bad  
So what's the use, you lied and that's the truth  
You took the key and drove right out on me  
I never knew put all my trust in you  
  
OK that's it, I'm leaving now, I quit  
I was unwise, so don't apologize  
I paid the price, for taking your advice  
I felt it all, just like a cannonball  
  
You can say what you want all day  
But I've never been so outraged  
I'm washing my hands of you  
How could you be so untrue  
You know I can't stand no more  
You know I can't stand no more

I never knew what a man was supposed to be  
I never wanted the responsibility  
I still remember what they tried to make of me  
They used to wonder what they couldn't get through to me,  
  
'Cause all that I had as this music  
A-coming to me  
And all that I had was this rhythm  
A-running through me.  
  
I took a tip from the man in the ministry  
He said, "My son, better work in the factory"  
Well there were days I can tell you quite honestly  
I saw myself winding up in the military  
  
So lucky to have all this music  
A-coming to me  
I'm lucky to have all this rhythm  
A-running through me  
  
I'm watching the movie go down  
Around, about me  
I'm watching the merry-go-round  
Go down about me.  
  
I said, "Lovers, you're needed in the garden  
'Cause there's a lot of crazy people  
Who've forgotten where their heart is  
And they don't give a damn  
About hurting those flowers and those trees."  
C'est bon, sailing on and on...  
  
Sometimes I wonder where my life is taking me  
Sometimes I wonder what they all expect of me  
Well there were days I can tell you quite honestly  
I saw myself winding up in the monastery  
  
'Cause all that I have is this music  
A-coming to me  
And all that I have is this rhythm  
A-running through me  
  
I'm watching the movie go down  
Around, about me  
I'm watching the merry-go-round  
Go down about me.  
  
I said, "Lovers, you're needed in the garden  
'Cause there's a lot of crazy people  
Who've forgotten where their heart is  
And they don't give a damn  
About hurting that small child in me."  
C'est le bon, sailing on and on

Well, who do you think you're foolin'?  
You say you're havin' fun,  
But you're busy going nowhere,  
Just lying in the sun.  
You tried to be a hero,  
Commit the perfect crime  
But the dollar got you dancing  
And you're running out of time.  
You're messin' up the water  
You're rolling in the wine  
You're poisoning your body  
You're poisoning your mind  
You gave me coca-cola  
You said it tasted good  
You watch the television  
If it tell you that you should.  
  
How can you live in this way?  
(Why do you think it's so strange?)  
You must have something to say.  
(Tell me why should I change?)  
There must me more to this life  
It's finally we did something right  
Child of Vision, won't you listen?  
Find yourself a new ambition.  
  
I've heard it all before  
You're saying nothing new  
I thought I saw a rainbow  
But I guess it wasn't true  
You cannot make me listen  
And you cannot make you hear  
You find your way to heaven,  
I'll meet you when you're there.  
  
How can you live in this way?  
(Why do you think it's so strange?)  
You must have something to say.  
(Tell me why should I change?)  
We have no reason to fight,  
'Cause we both know that we're right. Because  
Child of vision, won't you listen?  
Find yourself a new ambition.

Now you're very much like your mother  
And that's a natural fact  
But you couldn't look much like your brother's wife  
Or anyone like that  
  
And you don't look much like your sister  
'Cause she's all big and fat  
But don't breath a word to your mean old dad  
'Cause I'll be coming back  
  
I'm coming home to see you early in the morning  
I'll be around and on the first train today  
I'm coming home to see you while day's dawning  
All aboard, all aboard  
  
Put on some fancy clothes and meet me at the station  
Make sure I don't mistake you for your sister Jane  
Don't want to see you with your goddamn relations  
That's all for now, I'll see you, ciao

Now they're planning the crime of the century  
Well what will it be?  
Read all about their schemes and adventuring  
It's well worth a fee  
So roll up and see  
And they rape the universe  
How they've gone from bad to worse  
Who are these men of lust, greed, and glory?  
Rip off the masks and let see.  
But that's not right - oh no, what's the story?  
There's you and there's me  
Thank you for that

Even in the quietest moments  
I wish I knew what I had to do  
And even though the sun is shining  
Well I feel the rain, here it comes again, dear  
And even when you showed me  
My heart was out of tune  
For there's a shadow of doubt that's not letting me find you too soon  
The music that you gave me  
The language of my soul  
Oh Lord, I want to be with you.  
Won't you let me come in from the cold?  
  
Don't you let the sun fade away  
Don't you let the sun fade away  
Don't you let the sun be leaving  
Won't you come to me soon  
  
And even though the stars are listening  
And the ocean's deep, I just go to sleep  
And then I create a silent movie  
You become the star, is that what you are, dear?  
Your whisper tells a secret  
Your laughter brings me joy  
And a wonder of feeling I'm nature's own little boy  
But still the tears keep falling  
They're raining from the sky  
Well there's a lot of me got to go under before I get high  
  
Don't you let the sun disappear  
Don't you let the sun disappear  
Don't you let the sun be leaving  
No, you can't be leaving my life  
Say that you won't be leaving my life  
Say that you won't be leaving my life  
Say won't you please, stay won't you please  
Say won't you please, stay won't you please  
Lord, won't you come and get into my life  
Lord, won't you come and get into my life  
Say won't you please, stay won't you please  
Say won't you please, stay won't you please  
Oh Lord, don't go  
  
And even when the song is over  
Where have I been, was it just a dream?  
And though your door is always open  
Where do I begin, may I please come in, dear?

Sharing's good, sharing's fine  
But no one wants to share this world of mine  
Is dull, dark and grey  
And no one wants to find the way  
to my front door is always open to you  
  
Hey now life, give me a break  
For much more of this I cannot  
Take me to a far off place  
Where there's no rich or poor  
And every house has got an ever open door  
  
I want to find my direction  
I want my love and affection  
Yes I'm needing it more and more  
  
I want to find my own answers  
it's time I knew what my plans were  
I'm going to find out what I'm looking for  
  
I'm gonna take all my chances  
Gonna make my advances  
Gonna see what my life has in store  
  
I've got a feeling inside me  
I'll put the past way behind me  
Pick myself up from the floor  
  
I want my sun in the morning  
Want my friends to come calling  
I'll keep a welcome outside my door

History recalls how great the fall can be  
While everybody's sleeping, the boats put out to sea  
Borne on the wings of time  
It seemed the answers were so easy to find  
"Too late," the prophets (profits) cry  
The island's sinking, let's take to the sky  
  
Called the man a fool, striped him of his pride  
Everyone was laughing up until the day he died  
And though the wound went deep  
Still he's calling us out of our sleep  
My friends, we're not alone  
He waits in silence to lead us all home  
  
So tell me that you find it hard to grow  
Well I know, I know, I know  
And you tell me that you've many seeds to sow  
Well I know, I know, I know  
  
Can you hear what I'm saying  
Can you see the parts that I'm playing  
"Holy Man, Rocker Man, Come on Queenie,  
Joker Man, Spider Man, Blue Eyed Meanie"  
  
So you found your solution  
What will be your last contribution?  
"Live it up, rip it up, why so lazy?  
Give it out, dish it out, let's go crazy,  
Yeah!"

I will always love you true forever  
Forever, I will always love you true  
Hope you feel the same way too, forever  
Forever, I hope you feel the same way too  
Want to spend my life with you forever  
Forever want to spend my life with you  
  
My life with you, my life with you, oh  
Life with you, my life with you, oh  
  
Love you till the day I die, yeah forever  
Forever love you till the day I die  
So I'll sing this song to you forever  
Forever, I will sing this song to you  
  
Song to you, song to you  
Song for you, song for you  
Song for you, song for you...  
  
I really love you, I really need you  
I'll always love you...  
I really love you, I think about you...

When a spirit is broken  
Why go on  
When there's nothing to say  
And a love just a token  
It was strong  
Now it's fading away  
  
Ah but I'm free as a bird  
As I walk right out that door  
You have my word  
I won't bother you no more  
Yes I'm doing alright  
As I face the lonely night  
  
And our love it was over  
Long ago  
But we just didn't say  
And the years they have fallen  
One by one  
How they drifted away  
  
But now I'm free as a bird  
As I walk out that door  
You have my word  
I won't bother you no more  
Yes I'm feeling OK  
As I face the brand new day  
As I face the brand new day  
  
You know I'm free as a bird  
As I walk right out that door  
You have my word  
I won't bother you no more  
Yes I'm doing alright  
As I face the lonely night  
As I face the lonely night  
  
No more sorrows will I find  
I've got tomorrow on my side  
No more teardrops will I cry  
Left my teardrops way behind  
No more sorrows will I find  
I've got tomorrow on my side  
No more teardrops will I cry  
Left my teardrops way behind  
No more heartaches bother me  
Don't wear my heartaches on my sleeve  
  
It's gonna be a brand new story  
What's the use of former glory  
It's better not to do if you can't do right  
It's time to get to celebrating  
After all the years of waiting  
I'm gonna have a ball if it takes all night

Hey buddy, I want to talk to you  
About (I got?) a friend in need, a friend indeed  
I hear you got a few friends too  
Living up the stairs, selling their wears  
And they don't care, 'cause they don't know that  
  
Oooh he's very lonely  
Oooh he's lost his one and only  
Woman that he's ever had  
He sure feels bad, can you make him glad?  
Hey mister can you help him out?  
Can you put him straight, before it gets to late  
And show what it's all about  
  
Hey mister where you got the dope?  
Which way will it be, to pay the fee?  
I guess that you can see through me  
So I'll be straight with you, I'll tell the truth  
Friend in need is just really me

Monday has come around again  
I'm in the same old place  
With the same old faces always watching me  
Who knows how long I'll have to stay  
Could be a hundred years  
Of sweat and tears  
At the rate that I get paid  
  
Sometimes I slowly drift away  
From all the dull routine  
That's with me every day  
A fantasy will come to me  
Diamonds are what I really need  
Think I'll rob a store, escape the law  
And live in Italy  
  
Lately my luck has been so bad  
You know the roulette wheel's  
A crooked deal  
I'm losing all I had  
  
Soon be like a man that's on the run  
And live from day to day  
Never needing anyone  
Play hide and seek  
Throughout the week  
  
My life is full of romance  
  
Guess I'll always have to be  
Living in a fantasy  
That's the way it's got to be  
From now on  
You think I'm crazy I can see  
It's you for you, and me for me  
Living in a fantasy  
From now on

Give a little bit  
Give a little bit of your love to me  
Give a little bit  
I'll give a little bit of my love to you  
There's so much that we need to share  
Send a smile and show you care  
  
I'll give a little bit  
I'll give a little bit of my life for you  
So give a little bit  
Give a little bit of your time to me  
See the man with the lonely eyes  
Take his hand, you'll be surprised  
  
Give a little bit  
Give a little bit of your love to me  
I'll give a little bit of my life for you  
Now's the time that we need to share  
So find yourself, we're on our way back home  
  
Going home  
Don't you need to feel at home  
Oh yeah, we gotta sing

I live in a vacumn, no air  
I'm stuck in back room, somewhere  
But it don't bother me amyway 'cause I know  
Goin' to get out soon, I got places to go  
  
There's a big world waiting for me  
I just need a break, someone to believe  
but right now I'm just tryin' to survive  
Livin' rough, shackin' up, hangin' tough, shapin' up  
  
Get the picture, get the scene I paint fo ryou  
Ah, but it's worth it, all the pain I'm goin' through  
Beat the sidewalk, hear the fast talk, everyday  
I don't worry 'cause I know I'm on my way  
  
The view from my window, ain't too good  
Should be some mail for me soon from Hollywood  
When the phone rings, could be big things, anytime  
Operator is there somethin' wrong with this line  
  
Rejections, I've had a few  
Happens to the best, it ain't nothin' new  
Still I keep on swingin' away  
S'gonna be a breakthrough any day  
  
Keep hanging in there, that's my philosophy  
And soon I'll find my big chance, wait and see  
Some make it fast, but they just come and go  
Me, I'm built to last and that's one thing I know  
  
Those straight life people, they don't understand  
Yeah they just want it all laid out and planned  
Me, I'm not like them, I do things my own way  
I know I'm gonna break through any day  
  
Life in the city, can get you down  
There's amillion guys out there all snooping around  
You gotta think you're the best, beat out all the rest  
And fight your way up to the top of the town  
  
There's a big world waiting for me  
I just need a break, someone to believe  
Right now I'm just tryin' to survive  
I'm know I'm gonna get there, dead or alive  
  
I'm going to reach for the moon  
And all the stars too  
I'm gonna get there real soon, I know I will  
I want the universe, and all the planers too

It's raining again  
Oh no, my love's at an end.  
Oh no, it's raining again  
And you know it's hard to pretend.  
Oh no, it's raining again  
Too bad I'm losing a friend.  
Oh no, it's raining again  
Oh will my heart ever mend.  
Oh no, it's raining again  
You're old enough some people say  
To read the signs and walk away  
It's only time that heals the pain  
And makes the sun come out again  
It's raining again  
Oh no, my love's at an end.  
Oh no, it's raining again  
Too bad I'm losing a friend.  
  
C'mon you little fighter  
No need to get uptighter  
C'mon you little fighter  
And get back up again  
Oh get back up again  
Fill your heart again...

I'm feeling so alone now  
They cut the telephone uh huh  
Yeah my life is just a mess  
  
I threw it all away now  
I could have made a fortune  
I lost the craving for success  
  
And as the acrobats they tumble  
So the corn begins to crumble  
While in the mirror  
She admires a brand new dress  
  
Live on the second floor now  
They're trying to bust the door down  
Soon Ill have a new address  
  
So much for liberation  
They'll have a celebration  
Yeah I've been under too much stress  
  
And as the cloud begin to rumble  
So the juggler makes his fumble  
And the sun upon my wall is getting less  
  
Don't, give a damn  
Fight, while you can  
Kill, shoot em up  
They'll run amuck  
Shout, Judas  
Loud, they'll hear us  
Soldier, sailor  
They'll run for cover when they discover  
Everyone's a nervous wreck now  
  
I used to think she was so nimble  
Would have bought her as symbol  
But now I can't afford the pen to sign her checks  
  
Don't, give a damn  
Fight, while you can  
Kill, shoot em up  
They'll run amuck  
Shout, Judas  
Loud, they'll hear us  
Soldier, sailor  
They'll run for cover when they discover  
Everyone's a nervous wreck now  
  
Life's just a bummer they got your number  
Well give as good as we get now  
Rise from the gutter, stick with each other  
Well drive em over the edge now  
They're gonna bleed, that's what they need  
Well get together and blow their cover  
Were ready  
Yeah we're ready  
Yeah we're ready

Know who you are...  
There's a world wants to know you  
Know where to go...  
There's a world wants to touch you  
  
Feel all you can...  
Let your heart speak and guide you  
Don't be afraid...  
Of the love deep inside you.  
  
Bring it out for everyone  
When you smile we can see the sun  
Bring it out for all to hear  
Because you have so much to give  
  
And there's so much to know  
But if you wait for your moment  
Well, it may never show.  
  
Know who you are...  
There' a new song inside you,  
Weep if you can...  
Let the tears fall behind you.  
  
Bring it out for everyone,  
When you smile we can see the sun,  
Sing it out for all to hear  
Because you have so much to say  
  
And you have so much to do  
And everyone's waiting,  
Yes, it's all up to you.  
  
Know who you are...  
There's a world deep inside ou,  
Trust if you can...  
There's a friend the to guide you.

Dreaming nothing to do  
Dreaming nothing to say  
Can I say there's nothing to dream about  
But something keep us moving away?  
  
I said, "Land ho, will I be sailing forever?  
Oh, oh, I need some wind to take me to my goal  
Land ho, will I be giving forever?  
Oh, oh, I gotta find an anchor for my soul"  
  
Wind is all far I can see  
When I'm feeling to strife  
For there's something that's calling me  
Oh, something that's so hard to find  
  
I said, "Land ho, will I be sailing forever?  
Oh, oh, I guess, I'll feel my ship is getting old  
Land ho, will I be dreaming forever?  
Oh, oh, I gotta find an anchor for my soul"  
  
I said, "When you're alone there's not a sail in sight  
There's a great sky and you may just try to take a life  
Oh well, there once was a lady made me feel alright  
But she couldn't stay, she just sailed away  
Now this only waves to see me through the night"  
  
Maybe I'll always be sad  
And maybe there'll always be strife  
Drifting alone with a saddened tone  
Afloat in the ocean of life  
  
I said, "Land ho, you're sailing ship on forever?  
Oh, oh, I need some wind to take me to my goal  
Land ho, will I be searching forever?  
Oh, oh, I gotta find an anchor for my soul"  
  
Will I be sailing forever?  
Will I be dreaming forever?  
Will I be searching forever?  
Forever, forever, forever  
Forever, forever, forever

Well little by little

The situation's clear  
It's fine as long as you are here  
Of that I'm really sure  
I will live to love you more  
  
The say you drag me down  
They try to tell me your around  
Just to even up a score  
But I will live to love you more  
  
And the say I've been blind  
That you deceive me every time  
And soon our love will end  
But I will live to love you again  
  
So what if they can't see  
You know I'll love endlessly  
And this they can't ignore  
I will live to love you more  
  
I know they're only rumors  
Although they say the truth hurts  
I don't need to hear lies  
And fantasize you leaving me  
  
But when I think it all over  
And over and over  
I still want you around me  
You know you astound me  
I couldn't live without you  
  
If there's a price to pay  
It's worth it just to hear you say  
All their lies ere just a bore  
I will live to love you more and more  
  
You know where my heart is  
With you alone  
My every thought is  
I will live to love you more

I'll tell you from the start  
He's gonna break your heart  
You can't stop the lover boy  
You can't stop the lover boy  
  
He's gonna tell you lies  
But you won't realize  
Because you can't stop the lover boy  
You can't stop the lover boy  
  
He's got a thing in his head  
It's from a book he's read  
It's got a funny title,  
It tells you how to be vital  
  
He took a lot of time  
Over every line  
Because it's guaranteed  
To satisfy  
  
He's gonna knock 'em dead  
The boy's got that book read  
You can't stop the lover boy  
You can't stop the lover boy  
  
Right from the clothes he wears  
The way he combs his hair  
You can't stop him now, because he knows all the tricks  
He used to have a problem but he got it fixed  
  
He took a small apartment  
Above a shoe department  
And he could see from his window  
All the lights in the street glow  
  
There's a club on the corner  
And tonight he will go there  
To find a new affair  
So all you ladies beware  
  
He's got to have a good time in the city  
He's got to have a good time every night  
He's gonna love 'em and leave 'em, cheat and decieve 'em  
He's gonna show 'em who's wrong and who's right

Let me tell you what I want to say  
You're the only one who can make me feel this way  
My kind of lady  
No better love could I embrace  
  
No better heart, no other face  
Can quite compare with you  
You came along and then you mend my broken dreams  
I was so down and then as foolish as it seems  
  
You gave me your affection  
Yeah baby you came through  
We'll make it you'll see  
In spite of those who say it's wrong  
  
This time we feel that we belong  
Now we can truly say  
We'll be together and that's all we'll ever need  
We'll love each other, that's the way it's gonna be  
  
And nothin' under the sun of moon  
Can make us be apart  
Oh my honey  
You know I'll love you every day  
  
When things go wrong we'll find a way  
I'm so glad I met you  
Much more than I can ever say  
We're making plans and holding hands just like before  
  
We'll try again, we'll make amends along the road  
It's fellin' good, just like it should, this time we know  
We'll share each other's happiness for now and evermore  
I've been wastin' my life away  
  
I've got a message for you today  
To tell you that you are  
My kind of lady  
I'm not the same since I met you  
  
All of my dreams had fallen through  
And then you came along  
One magic night when things went right it was so fine  
Looked in your eyes and realized that you were mine  
  
And nothin' under the sun of moon  
Can make us be apart  
Oh my baby  
You know I'll love you all the way  
  
When times get hard we'll smile and say  
I'm so glad I met youI'll love you more and more each day  
We're making plans and holding hands just like before  
We'll try again, we'll make amends along the road  
  
It's fellin' good, just like it should, this time we know  
We'll share each other's happiness for now and evermore

I can't believe what you're saying about me  
I can't believe it's true  
You know you never should doubt me and take this attitude  
You say, "There's somethin' between us"  
That something just ain't right  
But every time I ask you to tell me why  
You say, "It's not the moment"  
You say, "It's not the moment"  
You say you're tired of walking on eggshells and falling in between  
That I'm two timing you but you know quite well that's just not my scene  
An' now my friends are starting to call me  
They say, "There's somethin' wrong"  
Ah, but you just continue to stall me  
You say, "It's not the moment"  
You say, "It's not the moment"  
Ya, we need to talk this through  
I do depend on you  
So let it out and try to clear the air  
I've got nothing I should hide  
I'm burning up inside  
But you just act like you don't even care  
Oh, well I know sometimes it ain't easy  
I know you're feeling bad  
But you know it's the wrong time to tease me  
It just gets me mad  
I'm goin' to find out sooner or later  
Just what you're tryin' to say  
So, when I ask you now for just one more time  
Don't say, "It's not the moment"  
Don't say, "It's not the moment"  
Ya, we need to talk this through  
I do depend on you  
So let it out and try to clear the air  
I've got nothing I should hide  
I'm burning up inside  
But you just act like you don't even care  
I told you I would be your friend  
Be there to the very end  
And then you had to let me down  
And go spreading dirty words around  

Nothing to show beyond the fear I had  
Body so warm within his perfumed bed  
Sleeping alone, the shadow of a man  
He will entice you too, and if he can  
Nothing to show for love has never been  
Nothing to show for love has never been  
Nothing to show for love has never been  
  
Nothing is handed, power is changing fast  
Many the empty hopes his lips caress  
Sorry to say his days are spent in vain  
Chasing a dream of doom of nights in pain  
Nothing to show for love has never been  
Nothing to show for love has never been  
Nothing to show for love has never been  
  
Shadowy nights of memories of the grave  
Gentle my love and sweetness sometimes sick  
Keep up his time while his crimes are known  
Only a fool can see he's sold his love  
Nothing to show for love has never been  
Nothing to show for love has never been  
Nothing to show for love has never been  
  
Nothing to show for love has never been  
Nothing to show for love has never been  
Nothing to show for love has never been

Trouble is my calling card, that's my middle name  
Ever since you walked away, things are not the same  
Now my life is misery, don't know what to do  
Yes your gone, your history, but I can't get over you  
  
Used to be in Shanggrila, life used to be so good  
You and me were going so far and that was understood  
But ever since you walked away, my world has turned so blue  
So now I live from day to day ?'cause I can't get over you  
  
Give our love another chance, you could make it so  
Just how this could go so wrong, I will never know  
  
Well I want you right next to me and that's all I can say  
And I've been calling ever since you drove me away  
You were on my mind so long, it?s hard for me to take  
Now my heart is not so strong and it might break over you  
  
You can wear a wig and some elevator shoes  
Make yourself twice as big, but I'm still coming after you

Put on your old brown shoes  
Right on your feet  
Time to move on, get away  
You know you did your dues  
Did all you could  
Time to move on, no more to say  
  
You and me, we're helpless can't you see  
We've got to get away, get away  
Got to move on  
Till the madness around is gone  
And the rest of our lives we'll be free  
  
Kick out the morning blues  
Who needs a job  
Who needs pain and oppression  
You know it can't be beat  
Stand on your own two feet  
Goodbye rain and depression  
  
You and me, helpless can't you see  
We've got to get away, get away  
Got to move on, catch the next train  
And we'll be gone  
And the rest of our lives we'll be free  
  
Get your blue jeans right on, babe  
Get your blue jeans right on, babe  
  
You know a friend is a friend  
You don't leave him in trouble  
He got a little drunk, so now he's seeing double  
Don't you see him there yeah lying in the rubble  
But you have to lend a hand  
Cause you know he's on the level  
  
You and me, we're helpless can't you see  
We've got to get away, get away  
Got to move on, catch the next train  
And we'll be gone  
And the rest of our lives we'll be free

I think it's funny, just a sad song  
He likes his money, now you ain't got none  
So is it mighty strange  
Now that you are so broke  
Don't try to make it man  
You haven't got a home  
  
[Chorus]  
Remember when I was in trouble  
You put down the phone  
And anywhere you go, you go alone  
  
It was a crush change, the money sure flew  
You had a flash name, imagine you're broke  
But now it's breaking up there's no one near you  
Don't try for me to call  
Cause I won't hear you  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Well, don't you sit around, start to move on  
Your life is broken down, so get a new one  
And if you make it by and kiss the good life  
Why don't you make it right  
Just look at this time  
  
[Chorus]

Acting upon information received  
Rosie had everything planned  
Stood in a garden with a shotgun in hand  
What a woman  
  
Whilst entertaining the headlines next day  
Rosie would not be released  
If it was found that her man was deceased  
Silly woman  
  
Oh but Rosie, a girl with a strange kind of humor  
Stupidly took in a rumor  
Making her think that she'd lost  
Double-crossed by a man who was dear  
  
Stood in the garden and shaking her head  
Rosie could not understand  
Wiping her eyes with the back of her hand  
Sad, sad woman  
  
Oh but Rosie, how could a few words have made her  
Certain that he had betrayed her  
Making her think that she'd lost  
Double-crossed by a man who was still very near to her  
  
Row upon row of angel hair  
Rosie had everything planned  
Sure that the people would not understand  
Sad, sad woman

I can see you in the morning when you go to school  
Don't forget your books, you know you've got to learn the golden rule,  
Teacher tells you stop your play and get on with your work  
And be like Johnnie-too-good, well don't you know he never shirks  
He's coming along..  
  
After school is over you're playing in the park  
Don't be out too late, don't let it get too dark  
They tell you not to hang around and learn what life's about  
And grow up just like them, won't you let it work it out  
And you're full of doubt  
  
Don't do this and don't do that  
What are they trying to do?  
Make a good boy of you  
Do they know where it's at?  
Don't criticize, they're old and wise  
Do as they tell you to  
Don't want the devil to  
Come out and put your eyes  
  
Maybe I'm mistaken expecting you to fight  
Or maybe I'm just crazy, I don't know wrong from right  
But while I am still living, I've just got this to say  
It's always up to you if you want to be that  
Want to see that  
Want to see that way  
You're coming along

Slow motion, slow motion baby  
We want our love to last  
Everything's so right, why try to go so fast  
It's easy to lose sight  
And then the moments passed  
  
Go easy, go easy baby  
You know there's time for us  
Even though this world seems to be speeding up  
Maybe we can try to slow things down  
  
Because we need to draw the line  
Because we need to make the time  
Because we need to sip the wine  
  
Because the clock is running,  
And it's going so fast  
The future's coming but it's soon the past  
It's here today and there's no turning back  
  
Go lightly, go lightly baby  
In time we'll find a way  
It's never over 'till it's over  
Why rush it through'  
Never pausing to admire the view  
  
Slow motion, well if we get tired  
Then we can rest awhile  
If we're gonna go, we're gonna go in style  
Isn't that what life is all about

You've been lyin'  
I've been cryin'  
You've been messin'  
I've been guessin' 'bout you  
You've been cheatin'  
I've been creepin' around  
You've been leavin'  
I'll be grievin', I'm grievin'  
  
But I'm still in love with you  
And no matter what you do  
Cause you know that in the end  
I'll come runnin' back again  
  
I've been drinkin'  
Got me thinkin'  
You've been tellin'  
I've been yellin' at you  
You've been stretchin'  
I've been fetchin' you back  
You've been tastin'  
  
But I'm still in love  
  
You've been sighin'  
And goodbyin'  
Never knowin'  
Where you're been choosin'  
I've been losin' you  
You're my lover  
But I discovered the truth  
  
But I'm still in love  
  
Got me dancin' on a string  
Like I just don't mean a thing  
Cause you know that in the end  
I'll come runnin' back again

Well, I don't care  
About the summer rain  
I know it's good for the garden  
Don't care what blue skies  
They turn to gray  
When you come around  
And try to run me down  
Storm clouds darken, yeah  
I don't get down when the fields go brown  
It's just a charm of the season  
Well, things in nature have their reason  
But when you come along and try to do me wrong  
Well, the first time, I'll ignore it  
But don't you push beyond the pale  
But then you're gonna find  
There's no more water in the well  
And you may think you're gonna walk  
Right all well over me  
But there's a sting in the tail  
Of this honey bee  
The wind blows cold as the year grows old  
Yeah, that's just the natural way it goes  
I feel a chill from my head down to my toes  
Each time you call my name and tell me I'm to blame  
Well, the first time, I'll ignore it  
But don't you push beyond the pale  
But then you're gonna find  
There's no more water in the well  
And you may think you're gonna walk  
Right all over me  
But there's a sting in the tail  
Of this honey bee  
I said the first time I'll ignore it  
But don't you push beyond the pale  
And then you're gonna find  
There's no more water in the well  
You may think you're gonna walk  
Right all over me  
There's a sting in the tail  
Of this honey bee  
Yes, there's a sting in the tail  
Well, the cold wind's gonna blow  
Let it rain, let it snow  
And don't give me your grief  
I can't take it anymore  

In the middle of our summer romance  
He walked up to her and he asked her to dance  
I could see the old love light in her eyes  
See the love light in her eyes  
  
It took a while to say, how's your new love, babe?  
  
My heart was beating with a rage like thunder  
And when I saw him, I began to wonder  
I could see the old love light in his eyes  
See the love light in his eyes  
  
It took a while to say, how's your new love, babe?  
How's your new love, babe?  
  
Well, in the middle of our summer romance  
He walked up to her, he said, 'Please, give me another chance'  
I could see the old love light in her eyes  
See the love light in her eyes  
  
It took a while to say, how's your new love, babe?  
Yes, it did, it did, it did  
  
It took a while to say, how's your new love, babe?  
Took a while to say, how's your new love, babe?

Oh Lordy I got to feelin' so cold  
You know the mornin' it ain't too good for my soul  
I've been workin' an' in some faraway place  
I got to thinkin' about your sweet smilin' face  
I got a thing for you, if you want me to  
Gonna change all my ways  
I'm gonna get off the road, I'm gonna lighten my load  
I got a thing for you, can you feel it too?  
I think I better slow down  
All my wandering's done, I found my place in the sun  
Ah woman, why d'you treat me this way?  
You don't believe a single word that I say  
But it's the truth now, you know I'll be home for good  
So what's with you now, I thought that you understood  
I got a thing for you, if you want me to  
Gonna change all my ways  
Gonna get off the road, I'm gonna lighten my load  
There ain't a woman alive could ever come close to you  
I won't know how to survive, so don't you fake with my view  
You say I'm putting you on and soon you'll be on your way  
Well woman you're wrong and that is all I can say, all I can say  
I got a thing for you, an' if you want me to  
Gonna change all my ways  
Gonna get off the road, I'm gonna lighten my load  
I got a thing for you, can you feel it too?  
I think I better slow down  
All my wandering's done, I found my place in the sun  
I got a thing for you  
If you want me to, gonna change all my ways  
I'm gonna get off the road, I'm gonna lighten my load  

Captain I am sorry that this ship should go a stray  
Letting the ocean have it's own way  
Lay me down to pass ?to send?, I'll pay for all my sins  
Pleading for mercy, my cancel begins  
  
Times have changed, and my vision ain't so strong  
For the battle was too long, for me to bear  
I don't feel the pain, for my soul is sinking fast  
And I know this is the last, the chance for me  
  
In and out of tumor, and in and out of mind  
Deeper the ocean, stronger the tide  
Stormy seas surround me, no sails to keep me dry  
I pray to you captain, but you heard not my cry  
  
Times have changed, and my vision ain't so strong  
For the battle was too long, for me to bear  
I don't feel the pain, for my soul is sinking fast  
And I know this is the last, the chance for me  
  
For me, for my story  
Let me lie in peace  
I want to say I'm sorry now  
  
Then I'll be on my way  
Then I'll be on my way  
Then I'll be on my way  
  
Times have changed, and my vision ain't so strong  
For the battle was too long, for me to bear  
I don't feel the pain, for my soul is sinking fast  
And I know this is the last, the chance for me

Traveled the world in million ways  
Catching the palm in familiar gaze  
Everyone lives by two hard eyes  
There's no one with time to laugh or cry  
There's no one to tell us what we're living for  
  
And though I tried to be a good man  
I just know that I'll be losing very soon  
And there are times and there are motions  
When I do believe I'm going out of tune, oh  
  
I've been around a long, long while  
Looking for sun to make me smile  
But still multiply their daily bread  
They're thinking their lives put times ahead  
It must be a mighty funny way to feel  
  
And though I tried to be a good man  
I keep finding out there's nowhere to begin  
And so I think I'll go on singing  
And in time I hope that we can all join in, oh

Look at me I'm a speck of sand,  
And I'm building ,dreams in a strangers land  
Tell me why do I care  
Tell me why do I care.  
  
Every time that I'm feeling down, oh they,  
Pick me up and they spin me round.  
Tell me where do we go,  
Tell me where do we go from here.  
  
What are we gonna find out (find out)  
What are we gonna find out (find out)  
Leave the wilderness, and as long as there's dreams,  
Just as long as there's two of us,  
Just as long as there's two of us, I'll carry on  
  
Won't you hold me  
  
When is man gonna find out (find out)  
When are we gonna find out (find out)  
What the universe is just waiting to here,  
Just as long as there's two of us  
Just as long as there's two of us  
Just as long as there's two of us,  
We'll carry on.

Did you get all you want?  
Did you see the whole show?  
So where's all the fun  
That we used to know?  
As the memories fade  
Way out of view  
I'd love those old days  
To come back to you  
  
I've been waiting so long  
I'm not feeling so strong  
  
Did you say what you mean?  
Did you mean what you say?  
About this new scene  
Is it really that way?  
But the blindness goes on  
You say it's not so  
But what do you know?  
  
I've been waiting so long  
I'm not feeling so strong  
  
Ain't nothing new, it's just the same old thing  
You got me singing those old blues again  
  
Angry music, words of fire  
Painted faces filled with rage  
Even then they sound so tired  
I must be set in my old ways  
  
If this world is unimpressive  
It's been that way for quite awhile  
I don't need no heavy message  
Just turn me on and make me smile  
  
Yes I've been waiting such a long time  
Just for something to ring true  
Now I'd rather taste the old wine  
Than mess around with something new  
  
And the blindness goes on  
The blindness goes on  
  
Don't leave me now  
  
Don't leave me now  
Leave me out in the pouring rain  
With my back against the wall  
Don't leave me now  
Don't leave me now  
Leave me out with nowhere to go  
And the shadows start to fall  
Don't leave me now  
Don't leave me now  
Leave me out on this lonely road  
As the wind begins to howl  
Don't leave me now  
Don't leave me now  
All alone on this darkest night  
Feeling old and cold and grey  
Don't leave me now  
  
Don't leave me now  
Leave me holding an empty heart  
As the curtain starts to fall  
Don't leave me now  
Don't leave me now  
All alone in this crazy world  
When I'm old and cold and grey and time is gone.

Haa, huh  
Well, I'm a wreck and I'm a tangle  
And though I try to find an angle  
Can't find my way around you  
No matter what I do  
And nothing's right since you left me  
My life was full but now it's empty  
Can't find my way around you  
You say, that you can't see a way  
(No matter what I do)  
That I can be a part of you  
It doesn't matter what I do  
Tried every trick that I can think of  
But you don't seem to think it's true love  
You take no notice of me  
Oh my, chance has passed me by  
(Oh, why can't you see?)  
See a way to change your mind  
Just let me know and I'll keep trying  
All my confidence is gone  
I was pretty sure that you would come along  
Thought that I would be your man  
But now I never know just where I stand with you  
I used to be the kind of guy  
Who could be in your arms before you'd realize  
Now the tables have been turned  
If you play with fire you know you sure get burned  
Now, all my confidence is gone  
I was pretty sure that you would come along  
Thought that I would be your man  
But now I never know just where I stand with you  
Oh, where I stand with you  
Just where I stand, where I stand, where I stand with you?  
I never know, you had to go  
Where I stand with you?  
You broke my heart, it came apart  
Where do I stand with you?  
Where I stand?  
(Where I stand?)  
Where I stand?  
(Where I stand?)  
Just where I stand with you?  
(Where I stand with you?)  
I never know  
(I never know)  
You have to go  
Where I stand with you?  

Why sing a lonely song?  
The whole world knows that love goes wrong  
Why loose a heart that isn't broken?  
It isn't broken, it can be broken  
  
Life's just a show for free  
Come along and watch with me  
The only sins are words unspoken  
Words unspoken, never spoken  
  
Sweet things come and go  
Give me shame, I'll give you wow  
To live for love isn't so easy  
It isn't easy, it won't be easy  
  
How all good men try,  
Look around and wonder why  
Can they shape this world to please me  
Can they please me, should they please me?  
  
And follow and maybe you'll correct me  
I wish you'd never met me  
For I am no gentle man  
And follow and while you watch and wonder  
I'll pull the world a sunder  
And show you who I am  
  
Send me a gentle dream  
of love so strange it's never seen  
And prove how such a love can happen  
It can happen, make it happen  
  
Fine things don't abound  
Fade away without a sound  
But hope must never end or slacken  
Never slacken, never slacken  
  
And follow and maybe you'll correct me  
I wish you'd never met me  
I am no gentle man  
And follow and while you watch and wonder  
I'll pull the world a sunder  
And show you who I am

One, two, three  
Yes, I've been waitin', but you just don't come around  
You've been droppin' in on everyone all over town  
Say what you like, but you just don't know your place  
And everywhere we go, people seem to know your face  
You've been checkin' out the scene, every single night  
Never knowing where you've been, you say, "It's alright"  
I placed all my faith in you, then you let me down  
Everything I said is true, but you don't hear a sound  
Yeah you ought to be ashamed, but you don't accept the blame  
They said it was too late, for your love  
They said it was too late, you're gonna go  
They said I was too late, for your love  
They said I was too late, you're gonna go  
You never can tell with friends  
You never can tell with, you never can tell with  
You never can tell with friends  
You never can tell with, you never can tell with  
Yes, every now and then, my mind turns things around  
And I believe it's true, that our love can still be found  
Just one thing I care about, from sea to shining sea  
And you know that's the love you give, the love you give to me  
You've been checkin' out the scene, every single night  
Never knowing where you've been, you say, "It's alright"  
I placed all my faith in you, then you let me down  
Everything I said is true, but you don't hear a sound  
Yeah you ought to be ashamed, but you don't accept the blame  
They said it was too late, for your love  
They said it was too late, you're gonna go  
They said I've been too late, for your love  
They said it was too late, you're gonna go  
You never can tell with friends  
You never can tell with, you never can tell with  
You never can tell with friends  
You never can tell with, you never can tell with  
You never can tell with friends  
...  

When you're in heaven  
What you gonna do?  
You're gonna sit around a cloud and say  
"Hey, what a lovely view"  
Is there a reason, why you're like you are?  
Is there a reason you'll be leaving?  
Is my love out of season?  
I wouldn't mind but to me that is Treason  
You started laughing  
When I held you in my arms  
You started leaving  
When I told you of my charms  
I was in love with you and then you said, we're through  
And then I said, "Boo hoo"  
Was my tie not on straight?  
Was it something I ate?  

You win, I lose  
I beg, you choose  
You're so cool and I'm confused  
I'm me and you're you  
You're so loose and I'm uptight  
You're day, I'm night  
  
Like two ships in the night in foggy weather,  
Just a waitin' for fresh winds to blow.  
Maybe we're losin' one another  
I could be wrong I don't know  
  
You get the best, I get the rest  
You pass the test, I'm just a mess  
You got it made, I'm in the shade  
Like two ships in the night  
Like two dopes in the boat, without a paddle  
Just a wonderin' why it don't go  
We could be losin' one another  
I could be wrong I don't know  
  
I know you're tryin' to phase me  
It's gonna drive me crazy  
I can't wait for the day when  
  
I win, You lose  
You beg and I choose  
You're in the shade, I'm on parade  
  
Like two ships in the night
