Hey, everybody  
Won't you just look around?  
Can't anybody see  
Just what's going down?  
Can't you take the time?  
Just to feel, just to feel what is real  
If you do, then you'll see that we got a raw deal  
They're killin' everybody, they're killin' me and you  
The fightin' and killin' everybody, I wish it weren't true  
They say we got to make war  
Or the economy will fall  
But if we don't stop  
We won't be around no more  
They're ruining this world  
For you and me  
The big heads of state  
Won't let us be free  
They made the rules once  
But it didn't turn out  
Now we must try again  
Before they kill us off  
No more dying  
No more killing  
No more dying  
No more fighting  
We don't want to die  
We don't want to die  
Please, let's change it all  
Please, let's make it all  
Good for the present  
And better for the future  
Love one another  
Let's show peace for each other  
We can make it happen  
Let's just make it happen  
We can change the world  
Please, let's change this world  
Please, let's make it happen  
For our children, for our women  
Change the world  
Please make it happen  
Come on, come on  
Yeah please, come on  
It's up to me, it's up to you  
Come on, let's do it now  
Yeah, do it now  

Here I am  
In this broken town  
Missing you  
Wishing you were still around  
  
Streets are full of people, happy  
Heading on their way  
Why am I the only one  
Who's COLD on such a pretty day?  
  
[Chorus]  
90 degrees and freezing  
I'm out here on my own  
I can't shake this feeling  
That I'm really all alone  
The Sun way up there shining  
But down here on the ground  
It's 90 degrees and freezing!  
  
Right or wrong  
This is how it is,  
The love that kept me warm  
Well, now it's his  
  
I remember how the heat in your eyes  
Helped me find my way  
How can I be left so cold inside  
On such a pretty day  
  
[Chorus: x2]

Please won't you sing me  
A thing that will bring me right into the sky  
If you would play it  
Just lay it down, say, it will help me get by  
  
Something to move me  
Remove me and grove me, you want to know why?  
I'm so tired of oldies  
And moldies and goldies, that I want to cry  
  
Can you play free  
Or in three or agree to attempt something new  
The people need you  
A seed that will lead to a hit by Varese

[MARY SUNSHINE]  
When I was a tiny tot  
Of maybe two or three  
I can still remember what  
My mother said to me...  
  
Place rose colored glasses on your nose  
And you will see the robins  
Not the crows  
  
for in this tense and tangled web  
Our weary lives may weave  
you're so much better off  
if you believe...  
  
That there's a little bit of good  
In everyone  
In everyone you'll ever know  
  
Yes, there's a little bit of good  
In everyone  
Though many times, it doesn't show  
  
It only takes the taking time  
With one another  
For under every mean veneer  
Is someone warm and dear  
Keep looking...  
  
for that bit of good in everyone  
The ones we call bad  
Are never all bad  
So try to find that little bit of good!  
  
Just a little, little bit of good  
  
Is someone warm and dear  
Keep looking...  
  
For that little good in everyone  
Although you meet rats  
They're not complete rats  
So try to find that little bit of good!

If you will think now, then you will see  
How you can change things  
People are waiting, turning away  
Tired of killing  
  
Hey now  
Will you go away  
We're so tired  
Of things that you say  
  
Even though you never said word that would help anyone but yourself  
Tomorrow is such a bad dream  
Oh, bad dream  
If you stay now  
  
It will only get worse  
Let us pray now  
'Cause the truth really hurts  
Have to be a man so today with your brothers and sisters lay dying  
  
Tomorrow is such a bad dream  
Yeah, such a bad dream  
Listen  
Please be gone  
  
Go away and leave us alone  
Bring police  
Go away and leave us in peace  
Yeah  
  
Please be gone  
Go away and leave us alone  
Bring police  
Go away and leave us in peace  
  
Will you go now  
Will you take all your friends  
Woah now, If you'd stood like a man  
Even though I know that you cannot be blamed all alone for all the sadness
you've caused  
  
Tomorrow is such a bad dream  
Yeah, such a bad dream  
Oh yeah, such a bad dream  
Dig it  
  
If you will think now you will then you will see  
How we can change things  
People are waiting, turning away  
Tired of killing

Done the things I said I would  
Some of them were pretty good  
Suddenly they changed the game  
I only know it's not the same no more  
I don't know what to do the rules I knew  
  
Ain't it sad  
Ain't it sad  
Ain't it true  
Ain't it true  
Ain't it blue  
Ain't it blue  
  
The life I live is pretty nice  
Of course I had to pay a price  
Lots of folks depend on me  
Crazy kind of slavery, what for  
I don't know what to do the rules I knew  
  
Ain't it sad  
Ain't it sad  
Ain't it true  
Ain't it true  
Ain't it blue  
Ain't it blue  
Ain't it blue  
  
Sometimes I want to walk away  
I felt like that just yesterday  
But then this song is in my head  
I try my best 'till I'm dead and gone  
I don't know what to do the rules I knew  
  
Ain't it sad  
Ain't it sad  
Ain't it true  
Ain't it true  
Ain't it blue  
Ain't it blue  
Ain't it blue

Oh what a lucky day  
Things are going my way  
Sun is arising mesmerizing everything I say  
People all around this uptight town  
Someone's gonna recoginze me  
Ain't it time  
Dues I've been paying for so long only making me stronger  
Lady luck won't you please come to me I can't wait any longer  
I spend all my time writing notes and rhyme  
Tryin' to find new dimensions  
Ain't it time  
Time for movin' on  
Time enough to grow  
Time enough to find myself  
Everything's okay  
What a lucky day  
Time enough to play my guitar  
Competition everywhere is getting all of us down  
I've been makin' all the rounds I feel like a train on the wrong track  
Don't get lost 'cause you might get caught going out  
The wrong door now  
Ain't it time  
Time for movin' on  
Time enough to grow  
Time enough to find myself  
Everything's okay  
What a lucky day  
Time enough to play my guitar  

Yesterday I would not have believed  
That tomorrow the sun would shine  
Then one day you came into my life  
I am alive again I am alive again  
  
All the empty yesterdays have disappeared  
Now that you have filled my life with love  
No one else could ever mean so much to me  
Every day my high lasts longer  
As our love grows ever stronger  
  
Yesterday I would not have believed  
That tomorrow the sun would shine  
Then one day you came into my life  
I am alive again I am alive again  
  
When you gave your love to me you changed my life  
Dreams that once seemed hopeless come with ease  
Thank you girl for being just the way you are  
I would never try to change you  
All I live for is to love you  
I'm feeling alive again  
I'm feeling alive again

Headed north on a one way trip  
I never thought I'd be back this way  
I never thought I'd be missin' you  
Enough to suffer for a whole night through  
  
Headed south and I didn't look back  
I rode the wind off the beaten track  
I tried runnin' from the thought of you  
Hunted down by what I know is true  
  
To the north to the south it don't matter  
Every road leads to you  
  
All roads lead to you wherever I go  
Every time I told you I was just passin' through  
What my heart didn't know  
Was all roads lead to you  
  
Headed east on an Amtrak train  
I hit the city in the pourin' rain  
I never thought I'd be callin' you  
Every hour from that hotel room  
  
Headed west on a jumbo jet  
I rode off into the red sunset  
I stood there knockin' on the devil's door  
Wonderin' what the hell I'm searchin' for  
  
To the east to the west it don't matter  
Every sign points to you  
  
All roads lead to you wherever I go  
Every time I told you I was just passin' through  
What my heart didn't know  
Was all roads lead to you  
  
All my life the winding road i followed  
Has led me straight to your arms  
  
All roads lead to you wherever I go  
Every time I told you I was just passin' through  
What my heart didn't know  
Was all roads lead to you

Come on babe why don't we paint the town  
And all that jazz

And roll my stockings down

But, Oh, I love my life  
And all

You ask me what I think,  
I tell you you ignore it.  
The reasons for it make me crazy.  
You ask me what is right,  
Huh, you never hear it.  
You're never nowhere near it baby.  
I spent my life believing,  
It would not end this way.  
  
[Chorus]  
All the Years we wasted  
All the Years we tried  
All the restless hours  
All the times we cried.  
  
You ask me what I want,  
I got no answer.  
I know I'm only dancing faster.  
So now we're stuck with us,  
With you and all your stories.  
Who's the fool and who'd the liar.  
I spent my life believing  
It would not end this way.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
All the years we gambled.  
All the years you lied.  
All the hopeless dreamers.  
All the dreams that died.  
  
[Chorus: Repeats till fade]

Looking back a few short years  
When we made our plans and played the cards  
The way they fell  
Clinging to our confidence  
We stood on the threshold of the goal  
That we knew, dear  
And though we had our fights  
Had our short tempered nights  
It couldn't pull our dreams apart  
All our needs and all our wants  
Drawn together in our heart  
We felt it from the very start  
It's all happened recently  
Now we're living in that dream  
We had not long ago  
Everything is going fine  
And now we just have to keep in mind  
We must set brand new goals  
We must not lose control  
Of the possibility of a new discovery  
That would let everybody see  
That we were just meant to be

Aloha mama don't go away  
Aloha mama I want you to stay  
  
Aloha mama won't you treat me right  
I need you tender woman won't you hold me tight  
Surf ridin' sister I want to taste your love  
Le's make it in the garden beneath the stars above  
  
Aloha mama don't go away  
Aloha mama I want you to stay  
  
Aloha mama have you got the cure  
My heart's all broken and I feel unsure  
Surf ridin' sister I got to fly away  
I'll be back in September that's the price I pay  
  
Aloha mama don't go away  
Aloha mama I want you to stay  
  
Can't you feel the trade winds blowin'  
There's a look in your eyes you're goin'  
Don't leave me now I'm a hurtin'  
If you'd look in my eyes you'd see hunger arise  
Can't you feel all these years I've been cryin' these years  
  
Aloha mama don't go away  
Aloha mama I want you to stay  
  
Aloha mama don't make me cry  
Aloha mama you know I'll die  
  
Aloha mama don't go away  
Aloha mama I want you to stay

There is a time when a man needs somebody to talk to  
Someone to talk to, somebody who'll always be there  
(All alone) Nothin' seemed to matter  
(So alone) Doesn't get much better  
(Can't explain) Something that you're feeling  
For the very first time  
  
There was a time when you needed someone to hold on to  
Someone to hold you, somebody who's always sincere  
(All alone) Suddenly you see her  
(So alone) You know you're gonna meet her  
(Can't explain) Something that you're feeling  
For the very first time  
  
Then along comes a woman  
There's a change in the way  
That you're feeling tonight  
Then along comes a woman  
And you know that it's right  
  
There was a time that you needed somebody to count on  
You needed someone to count on, somebody to care  
(Now she's here) Nothin' seems to matter  
(She's so near) Everything is better  
(Can't explain) Something that you're feeling  
For the very first time  
  
Then along comes a woman  
There's a change in the way  
That you're feeling tonight  
Then along comes a woman  
And you know that it's right  
(And you know that it's right)  
  
Then along comes a woman  
There's a change in the air  
That you're breathing tonight  
Then along comes a woman  
And you're holding her tight  
  
Then along comes a woman  
There's a change in the way  
That you're feeling tonight  
Then along comes a woman  
And you know that it's right  
(And you know that it's right)  
  
Then along comes a woman  
There's a change in the air  
That you're breathing tonight  
Then along comes a woman  
And you're holding her tight

Baby, I may never know exactly what you're feelin'  
But I've seen you on another roll  
Maybe I'm that last to see the glances you've been stealing  
What you're looking for is takin' its toll  
  
No guarantees, so baby please  
Got to keep the sugar coating to yourself  
Either stay with me, or set me free  
Gotta let me get myself off the shelf  
  
I've been here, it's all clear...  
You've already gone  
And I know  
'Cause it shows  
You're already gone!  
  
And you're already gone  
Down the road  
All on your own  
Check please, Louise  
What did I expect?  
  
And you're already gone  
Down the road  
Ain't nobody home  
Check please, new squeeze Thank you very... next!  
  
And so, now, we find ourselves  
Exactly where we started  
Tryin' to fall in love with somebody else  
Don't know how to play this game  
And not be broken-hearted  
And I can't believe the lies I'm gonna tell  
  
Don't lie to me, Pinocchio  
Gotta keep the sugar coating to yourself  
Baby, stay with me or let me go  
Gotta let me get myself off the shelf  
You can't hide, down inside  
You're already gone!  
  
I'll be fine in my mind  
You're already gone!  
  
And you're already gone, down the road  
All on your own  
Check please, Louise  
  
What did I expect?  
  
And you're already gone, down the road  
Ain't nobody home  
Check please, new squeeze  
Thank you very... NEXT!  
  
And you're already gone, down the road  
All on your own...  
Check please, new squeeze  
What did I expect?  
  
And you're already gone, down the road  
All on your own...  
Check please, new squeeze  
Thank you very... NEXT!  
  
And you're already gone, down the road All on your own...  
Check please, Louise  
What did I expect from you  
Baby, baby, baby  
  
And you're already gone, down the road  
Ain't nobody home  
Check please, new squeeze  
Check please!  
  
I wants to thank you all very... NEXT!

Another rainy day in New York City  
Softly sweet, so silently it falls  
As crosstown traffic crawls  
  
Memories in my way in New York City  
Tender, tough, too tragic to be true  
And nothing i can do  
  
City workers cheer  
The taxis disappear  
Another rainy day in New York City  
  
Another spacey stay in New York city  
High up in an overpriced hotel  
The view is really swell  
  
Windy, wet and gray in New york City  
No one here i really want to see  
Old friends and family  
  
So suddenly serene  
The air is fresh and clean  
Another rainy day in New York City

How could I be happy  
Without her by my side  
Without her smiling face  
At the sunrise?  
  
How could I keep living  
With emptiness inside  
With no one there to touch  
At the sunrise?  
  
She gave meaning to my words  
She helped me find my way  
  
The time I had to leave her  
Leave her all alone  
The way she looked at me  
Made me cry  
  
I know she understands me  
She knows I'm feelin' bad  
Until I'm back beside her  
At the sunrise

Right before my very eyes  
I thought that you were only fakin' it  
And like before my heart was takin' it  
Baby, what a big surprise  
Right before my very eyes  
Yesterday it seemed to me  
My life was nothin' more than wasted time  
But here today you've softly changed my mind  
Baby, what a big surprise  
Right before my very eyes  
Just to be alone  
Was a little more than I could take  
Then you came to stay  
Hold me in the mornin'  
Love me in the afternoon  
Help me find my way, heh, yeah  
Now and then just like before  
I think about the love I've thrown away  
But now it doesn't matter anyway  
Baby, what a big surprise  
Right before my very eyes  
Baby, what a big surprise  
Right before my very eyes  
Baby, what a big surprise  
Right before my very eyes  
Baby, what a big surprise  
Right before my very eyes  
Baby, what a big surprise  

She said, "Tell me what it's all about." I said "Why, why, why?  
It's just something you could do without. You better try, try try."  
She said, "I can't reach you on the telephone.  
I can't call you when you're not at home.  
You keep saying that you're all alone.  
That's a lie, lie, lie."  
  
[Chorus:]  
Bad advice had me down and undone. Got to try again to believe in myself.  
Look at me, I'm alone in the end. Can you see me falling, falling down.  
I said, "Mama can you get it straight?" She said "Why, why, why?"  
-"I want to tell you that it just can't wait, so let's try, try, try"  
She said, "I don't care where you might have gone.  
I don't care 'cause you've done me wrong.  
You been doin' it far too long,  
So goodbye, bye, bye."  
  
[Chorus]  
She said "Tell me what it's all about." I said, "Why, why, why?  
It's just something you can do without. You better try, try, try."  
"I can't reach you on the telephone. I can't call you when you're not at home  
You keep saying that you're all alone. That's a lie, lie, lie.

When I'm with you,  
It doesn't matter where we are,  
Or what we're doing,  
I'm with you that's all that matters  
  
Time passes much too quickly  
When we're together laughing  
I wish I could sing it to you. whoa-oh  
Wish I could sing it to you  
  
Woah  
Woah  
Mostly I'm silent  
Silent  
Try and think of the right words to say  
  
When I kiss you,  
I feel a thousand different feelings,  
A pletora of chills  
All over my body.  
And when I feel them,  
I quickly try to decide which one  
I should try to put into words, woah-oh  
Try to put into words  
Woah  
Woah  
Mostly I'm silent  
Silent  
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la  
Silent  
  
Only the beginning  
Of what I want to feel forever  
Yes, only the beginning  
Only just the start  
I've got to get you into my life, mama  
Got to get you next to me  
Yes, only the beginning,  
Only just the start  
Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey-hey-hey  
Oh, all right

You can count on a number of things  
Like tomorrow the sun's gonna shine  
There'll be flowers in spring time  
Poets will make rhymes  
Couples in moonlight are so ripe to fall  
  
Fallin' in love, such a natural thing  
There's a look in that one person's eyes  
And the moment we know it  
We don't want to blow it  
So we get way too careful and it all slips away  
  
You've always told me  
You can do better  
And something would always come along,  
And so I listened, down to the letter  
'Til somebody better came along  
  
You, you can do better  
Talkin' to you, you, you, you  
You gotta do better!  
  
Now I feel like I'm swimming upstream  
When the current is running so strong  
I'm a fish out of water  
The first time I saw you  
Couldn't keep it together  
Don't care if I'm wrong  
But it seems like forever  
Since we got along  
  
You've always told me  
You can do better  
And something would always come along  
And so I listened, down to the letter  
'Til somebody better came along  
  
You said it so often  
You thought I'd believe it  
That I was always doin' it wrong,  
But you always said that  
You could take it or leave it  
So, somebody better came along!  
  
Now I feel like I'm swimming upstream  
When the current is running so strong  
I'm a fish out of water  
The first time I saw you  
Couldn't keep it together  
Don't care if I'm wrong  
But it seems like forever  
Since we got along  
  
You said it so often  
You thought I'd believe it  
That I was always doin' it wrong,  
But you always said that  
You could take it or leave it  
So, somebody better came along!  
  
You, you can do better, better.  
Talkin' to you, you, you  
You gotta do better!

My mama done told me when i was in knee-pants,  
My mama done told me, she said son!  
A woman will sweet-talk ya, she'll give you the big eye,  
But when that sweet talkin' is done  
A woman's a two-face, a worrisome thing  
Who'll leave ya to sing the blues in the night.  
  
Now the rain's a fallin', hear the train a callin', whoo-ee,  
Hear the lonesome whistle blowin' 'cross the trestle, whoo-ee,  
Whoo-ee-a-whoo-ee, ol' clickety-clack  
I'm back on the track of blues in the night  
  
The evening breeze will start the trees to cryin'  
And the moonlight will hide its light,  
When you get the blues in the night.  
  
Take my word, the mockingbird  
He will sing the saddest kind of song,  
He knows things are wrong and he's right.  
From natchez to mobile, from Memphis to St.Joe,  
Wherever the four winds seem to blow,  
  
I've been in some big towns and I've heard me some big talkin',  
But there is one thing I know,  
A woman's a two-face, she's a worrisome thing  
Who'll leave you to sing the blues in the night.  
  
(Got a case of the blues in the night, don't know what to do  
Blues every night...)

Now I lay me down before I sleep  
Pray the Lord my soul to keep  
Stay with me Jesus through the night  
?til I wake in the morning light  
Merry Merry Christmas  
Glory to the King.  
Now I lay me down before I sleep  
Pray the Lord my soul to keep  
Stay with me Jesus through the night  
?til I wake in the morning light  
Christmas day is coming  
Glory to the King  
La la la la la la la  
La la la la la la la  
La la la la la la la  
La la la la la la la  
Glory to the King  
Glory Glory Glory  
Glory to the King  
God bless us on this Christmas day  
Pease on earth for this we pray  
Love is a gift we all must give  
Love is all there is  
Love is all there is  
Love is all there is  
There is  

Christmas time is here  
Happiness and cheer  
Fun for all  
The children call  
Favorite time of year  
Snowflakes in the air  
Carols everywhere  
Olden times  
And ancient rhymes  
Love and dreams to share  
Sleigh bells in the air  
Beauty everywhere  
Yuletide by the fireside  
And joyful memories there  
Christmas time is here  
Families drawing near  
Oh that we could always see  
Such spirit through the year  
Sleigh bells in the air  
Beauty everywhere  
Yuletide by the fireside  
And joyful memories there  
Christmas time is here  
Families drawing near  
Oh that we could always see  
A favorite time of year

I understand there's no future for us here  
Guess, I fooled myself into thinkin' there was  
Now you've made it clear  
It will never be right, guess we knew it all along  
Now we've got to say goodbye  
And I've got to be strong  
So tell me one more time, how it's better for the both of us  
Tell me one more time, how we'll hurt each other if we stay  
Tell me one more time, my darlin' there's just one more thing  
Before you walk away  
Explain it to my heart, it's better that we're over now  
Tell me one more time, this is the way it's suppose to be  
Tell me that I'm better off without you, how it's better to forget about you  
Darlin' I understand, now won't you please explain it to my heart?  
Now if I try, I can see the reasons why  
Why we can't stay together  
And I might convince my mind  
But it's breakin' my heart to know I've got to let you go  
To find that I must leave behind  
The only love I've known  
Well, I can tell myself that I never really needed you  
I can tell myself that it's better just to say goodbye  
I can tell myself a thousand lies but tell me now  
Tell me how I do  
Explain it to my heart, it's better that we're over now  
Tell me one more time, this is the way it's suppose to be  
Tell me that I'm better off without you, how it's better to forget about you  
Darlin', I understand, now won't you please explain it to my heart?  
Say that I'll be better if we don't stay together  
Say that I'll be better off free but don't say it to me  
Explain it to my heart, tell me that I'm better off without you  
How it's better to forget about you, darlin', I understand  
Now, won't you please explain it to my heart?  
It's better that we're over now, tell me one more time  
This is the way it's suppose to be, tell me that I'm better off without you  
How it's better to forget about you, darlin', I understand  
Now, won't you please explain it to my heart?  

Going where the orange sun has never died  
And your swirling marble eyes shine  
Laughing  
Burning blue the light  
Bittersweet the drops of life  
Memories only fading  
  
Fancy colors  
Fancy colors  
  
All we ever did see  
When we're down at the sea  
We see things so very clear at the sea  
  
Fancy colors  
Fancy colors  
  
All we ever can do  
The morning covered with dew  
We do things so very fine in the dew  
  
Fancy colors  
Fancy colors  
  
All we ever do hear  
But whether we're here or there  
We hear things so very fine when we're there

So everybody's pulling you in all directions  
You don't know how much longer to take it  
So you've learned how to fake it  
That smile on the outside's fading fast  
Like the things that you thought for sure would last  
But they didn't  
You know something's missing  
Is it your life you're not living?  
Chorus:  
Your heart is cold, your soul is numb  
You don't like who you've become  
You played the game and paid the cost for long enough  
So grab the reins, yeah, take the wheel  
Lose what's not and keep what's real  
It's not too late,  
Just close your eyes and feel, feel  
You can't tell if you're happy or sad  
Can't tell the good from bad  
It's senseless  
To waste your senses  
Maybe stop thinking with your head  
Start using your heart instead  
Just try it  
You just might like it  
Aren't you dying to start livin'?  
[Chorus:]  
Every breath that's going thru you  
Take each day that's given to you  
To love back the ones who love you  
[Chorus:]  
You can't tell if you're happy or sad  
Can't tell the good from the bad  
Feel and stop thinking with your head  
Start using your heart instead  
Your heart is cold, your soul is numb  
Yeah, yeah, yeah....  
You've played the game for long enough, oh, no, no,  
Everybody's pulling you in all directions.

Velma:  
Thank you. Roxie and I would just like to thank you - for  
You faith and your belief in our innocence.  
  
Roxie:  
Yes, it was letters, telegrams, and words of encouragement  
That helped see us through this terrible ordeal of ours.  
  
Velma:  
You know, a lot of people has lost faith in America.  
  
Roxie:  
And for what America stands for.  
  
Velma:  
But we are the living examples of what a wonderful country this is.  
  
Roxie:  
So we'd just like to say thank you and God Bless you.  
  
Velma and Roxie:

Thank you and God bless you... Chorus:

God bless you. But, oh,  
God bless you. I love my life...  
  
Velma, Roxie et al.:  
And all that jazz  
  
Company:  
That jazz!

Every day it seems we hear the same old story.  
Every day there's lovers giving up on love.  
People say it's just a fact of modern living.  
All around us, people fall in love and marry.  
Then we hear they're breaking up, and wonder why?  
Did they mean it when they said it was forever?  
All I know is what I feel.  
[Chorus:]  
Forever  
Is a long, long time.  
Longer than we ever realize.  
Forever  
Is a long, long time.  
I'm gonna love you the rest of my life.  
Forever.  
Every day I spend with you, I call it lucky,  
Every night we touch and speak the words of love.  
Did I mean it when I said it was forever?  
All I know is what I feel.  
[Chorus]  
I'm gonna love you the rest of my life  
Forever

Roxie.  
Sometimes I'm right  
Sometimes I'm wrong  
But he doesn't care  
He'll string along  
He loves me so  
That funny honey of mine  
Sometimes I'm down  
Sometimes I'm up  
But he follows 'round  
Like some droopy-eyed pup  
He loves me so  
That funny honey of mine  
  
He ain't no sheik  
That's no great physique  
Lord knows, he ain't got the smarts  
  
But look at that soul  
I tell you that whole  
Is a whole lot greater  
Than the sum of his parts  
  
And if you knew him like me  
I know you'd agree  
  
What if the world  
Slandered my name?  
Why, he'd be right there  
Taking the blame  
  
He loves me so  
And it all suits me fine  
That funny, sunny, honey  
Hubby of mine!  
  
(dialog)  
  
He loves me so  
That funny honey of mine!  
  
(dialog)  
He loves me so  
That funny honey , of mine!!  
  
(dialog)  
  
Lord knows  
He ain't got the smarts  
  
(dialog)  
  
Now he's shot of his trap  
I can't stand that  
Sap  
  
Look at him go  
rattin' on me  
With just one more  
Brain  
What a half-wit  
He'd be  
  
If they string me  
Up  
I'll know who  
Brought the  
Twine  
  
That scummy,  
Crummy  
Dummy hubby of  
Mine

Come to me, baby mine  
And I'll make love to you  
Just when the sun begins to shine  
On the morning dew  
I've been gone, far away  
The days they seemed like years  
Right by your side I'm gonna stay  
Kiss away your tears  
Gently I'll wake you  
I won't hardly shake you  
Gently I'll wake you  
I won't hardly shake you  
And I'll make sweet love to you  
Hold me tight, don't let go  
We'll dream the whole day through  
I missed you more than you could know  
I love only you  
Come to me, baby mine  
And I'll make love to you  
Just when the sun begins to shine  
On the morning dew  
Gently I'll wake you  
I won't hardly shake you  
Gently I'll wake you  
I won't hardly shake you  
And I'll make sweet love to you

Tonight it's very clear  
As we're both lying here  
There's so many things I wanna say  
I will always love you  
I would never leave you alone  
Sometimes I just forget  
Say things I might regret  
It breaks my heart to see you cryin'  
I don't wanna lose you  
I could never make you be alone  
I am the man who would fight for your honor  
I'll be the hero you're dreamin' of  
We'll live forever  
Knowing together that we  
Did it all for the glory of love  
You keep me standing tall  
You helped me through it all  
I'm always strong when you're beside me  
I have always needed you  
I could never make you be alone  
I am the man who will fight for your honor  
I'll be the hero you been dreamin' of  
We'll live forever  
Knowing together that we  
Did it all for the glory of love  
Like a knight in shining armor  
From a long time ago  
Just the time I'd save the day  
Take you to my castle far away  
I am the man who would fight for your honor  
I'll be the hero that you're dreamin' of  
Gonna live forever  
Knowing together that we  
Did it all for the Glory of Love  
We'll live forever  
Knowing together that we  
Did it all for the Glory of Love  
We did it all for love

Smoke in the sky  
Slime in the sea  
Tall timber tumblin' down around me  
Red acid rain  
  
Glows in the night  
Nuclear winter closes down on me  
The light of the world is fading to black  
And the absence of people who care  
  
Is bringing me down, bringing me down  
  
[Chorus]  
God save the queen  
Dear mother earth is dying away  
Time's running out  
One more tomorrow depends on today  
  
Nowhere to run  
Nowhere to hide  
Greenhouse condition getting' steamier  
  
Nobody's clean  
Nobody's free  
Nobody's breathin' any easier  
The children of earth are dying each day  
  
And the nightmare of who is to blame  
Is bringing me down, bringing me down  
  
[Chorus]

I thought for the rest of my life  
You'd see me through it  
Guess, all along I knew it  
Nothing mattered, everything was all right  
When you saw to it  
Before I knew it you were gone, long gone  
You said, you would always be there  
When I believed you  
I was a fool to need you  
Gave my love then I gave you my heart  
And then you flew it  
Before I knew it you were gone, long gone  
Hard facing another day  
Just crying the night away  
Said more than I meant to say  
When I knew that you were gone  
Hard facing another day  
Just crying the night away  
Said more than I meant to say  
When I knew that you were gone  
Hard facing another day  
Just crying the night away  
Said more than I meant to say  
When I knew that you were gone  
Hard facing another day  
Just crying the night away  
Said more than I meant to say  
When I knew that you were gone  
I thought for the rest of my life  
You'd see me through it  
Yes, all along I knew it  
Didn't matter and it didn't seem right  
And then you flew it  
Before I knew it  
You were gone, long gone  
Gone long gone  
You were gone, long gone  

America needs you  
Harry Truman  
Harry could you please come home  
Things are looking bad  
I know you would be mad  
To see what kind of men  
Prevail upon the land you love  
  
America's wondering  
How we got here  
Harry all we get is lies  
We're gettin' safer cars  
Rocket ships to mars  
From men who'd sell us out  
To get themselves a piece of power  
  
We'd love to hear you speak your mind  
In plain and simple ways  
Call a spade a spade  
Like you did back in the day  
You would play piano  
Each morning walk a mile  
Speak of what was going down  
Each honesty and style  
  
America's calling  
Harry Truman  
Harry you know what to do  
The world is turnin' round and losin' lots of ground  
Oh Harry is there something we can do to save the land we love  
Oh woah woah woah  
  
America's calling  
Harry Truman  
Harry you know what to do  
The world is turnin' round  
And losin' lots of ground  
So Harry is there something we can do to save the land we love  
Oh  
Harry is there something we can do to save the land we love  
Harry  
Harry is there something we can do to save the land we love

I keep on thinkin' I should be free  
This time just leave it alone  
With 17 reasons not to believe  
Nothin' goes everybody knows like you always want it to be  
  
But, here in my heart  
There's a dream that's unbroken  
And it get's in my way  
But it won't be denied  
Here in my heart the door is still open  
Waiting for you to walk into my life (oohh oo-oo-ooh)  
  
What I've been feelin' I can't explain  
Lost in the muse of your eyes  
An' I'm fallin' so hard  
Just like the rain  
Comes a time when ya cross the line and you know you got to believe  
  
'Cause here in my heart  
There's a dream that's unbroken  
An' it gets in my way  
But it won't be denied  
Here in my heart the door is still open  
Waiting for you to walk into my life  
  
I know!  
(That) I may never sleep again  
'Till I see you (ooh oo-oo-ooh)  
Oh, baby, I know (I know!)  
Life is too short and I can't pretend  
It's not about you (not about you)  
Can't do without you  
Wooo oo-oo-ooh  
  
Here in my heart  
There's a dream that's unbroken  
And it get's in my way (gets in my way)  
But it won't be denied  
Here in my heart (here in my heart)  
The door is still open  
Waiting for you to walk into my life  
There's a dream that's unbroken  
It gets in my way  
But it won't be denied  
Here in my heart (here in my heart)  
The door is still open  
Waiting for you to walk into my life  
In my life (in my life)  
In my life (in my life)

We rode the train  
From Paris to the cold Atlantic shore  
The winter rain  
Kept us in each other's arms until the dawn  
Do you remember?  
  
Faster than the sun  
Flying higher than everyone  
Like a dream too good to last  
I won't regret the past  
  
[Chorus]  
Here with me  
Deep down in my soul now and forever  
A candle for the dark, I keep you  
Here with me  
A story with an unexpected end  
  
The morning plane  
Through empty doors a mountain in the sky  
The golden chain  
The autumn treetops cast a northern light  
Do you remember?  
  
We have no common ground  
Treasure lost will now be found  
We can blame our wild at heart  
From now and from the start  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Remember feelings I have shown  
Chasing dreams I've never done  
Illusion lead us both away  
Hold me in your arms before you go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Deep down in my soul you will be  
Here with me  
A story with an unexpected end  
Everywhere I go you're here with me

You know I gotta go  
Got to find a place  
Get away  
From the human race  
  
Find a place where the air is clear  
On a sunny day, sunny day  
I got to find  
A Hideaway, hideaway  
  
Hideaway  
Hideaway  
Hideaway  
Hideaway  
  
You know I gotta leave  
Got to find a place, any place  
Get away  
From the city pace, city pace  
  
I gotta go out where the air is fresh and clear  
On a sunny day, sunny day  
And I got to find  
A hideway, yeah yeah

Why, why, why won't you sympathize  
And tell me where you're coming from?  
My, my, my, don't you realize  
We're not lovin' when there's something wrong?  
  
Come here mama, let me make it right  
I know that we can work it out  
No sense talkin' 'bout a love gone bad  
  
You got to hold on, hold on baby  
Hold on, hold on baby  
You got to hold on, hold on baby  
You got to hold on  
  
Why, why is it always something new?  
Baby, I'm just dyin' to please  
Cry, cry, cry when you're singin' the blues  
I'm just bringin' my sympathies  
  
Hey, little mama won't you change your mind?  
Don't go running away  
Please come home where you know you belong  
  
You got to hold on, hold on baby  
Hold on, hold on baby  
You got to hold on, hold on baby  
You got to hold on  
  
And I know when the feeling gets you  
It's gonna get you  
And I know where it's gonna get you  
Right there in the back of your mind  
  
And I know when the feeling gets you  
I won't forget you  
Yes, you know that I won't forget you  
Got too much on my mind  
  
And I know when the feeling hits you  
It's gonna hit you  
Yes I know where it's gonna hit you  
Right there in the back of your mind  
  
I know when the feeling hits you  
I'll never quit you  
Yes, you know that I'll never quit you  
Got too much on the line  
  
And I know when the feeling get you  
It's gonna get you  
And I know where it's gonna get you  
Right there in the back of your mind  
  
I know when the feeling gets you  
I won't forget you  
Yes, you know that I won't forget you  
Got too much on my mind  
  
And I know when the feeling hits you  
It's gonna hit you  
Yes I know where it's gonna hit you  
Right there in the back of your mind  
  
I know when the feeling hits you  
I'll never quit you  
Yes, you know that I'll never quit you  
Got too much on the line  
  
You got to hold on, hold on, baby  
Hold on, hold on, baby  
Got to hold on, hold on baby  
Got to hold on, hold on baby

Walkin' through time  
Reachin' for yesterday  
'Cause we're frightened of tomorrow  
Trying to find  
The feeling that's gone astray, far away  
I remember the look in your eyes  
Love we made unafraid  
Now we've opened the window  
So let's not close the shade  
  
(Chorus)  
Holdin' on  
'Cause the memory of you  
Is something I just can't erase  
Holdin' on  
I don't know what to do  
'Cause the pieces won't fit into place  
But no matter what happens  
We can't let it end this way  
So far away  
So close to something new  
But we're holdin' off tomorrow  
Maybe someday  
We'll find what we need to do, until then  
We'll be doing the best that we can  
Out of rhyme, out of time  
While we're hiding our feelings  
We're leaving love behind  
  
(Chorus)  
Far away  
Reachin' for yesterday  
So far away  
Something has gone away  
So afraid  
To find what we had  
  
(Chorus)

Here I go again  
Why does the ghost of love still haunt me  
It's all been cried about before  
It's all been cried about before  
  
Yes, it's all been cried about before  
Still it's everywhere  
Is it crying to be heard  
Don't you think you've had your say  
Don't you think you've had your say  
  
Yes, don't you think you've seen your day  
I don't know  
No I don't  
Don't I know  
No I don't  
  
I don't know  
Not knowing if it's love  
Is better than no thoughts of love at all  
But it's been cried about before  
  
I guess I'll cry for it some more  
It's just the hope for love once more  
It's just the hope for love once more

I used to be the first one to cry  
So afraid of a lonely tomorrow.  
Heartache was all that I had  
To call my own- so all alone.  
You came along and gave to my life  
Something more than the pain and the sorrow.  
Now that you're with me, we'll never be alone,  
In love, in love.  
Chorus:  
I believe  
In the love that you gave,  
I believe  
In the life that you saved,  
I believe how you make me feel  
Today  
I believe in you  
Night after night, I waited alone  
For something deeper than yesterday's feelings.  
Never believing that love would ever come  
To me- oh no.  
Then there was you, and out of the blue,  
Once a heart that was broken was healing.  
Love is the reason we'll never be alone,  
Oh no- oh no  
Chorus  
I still believe,  
Believe in something right.  
'cause I love you for believing in me.  
I believe in you.  
Chorus  

Thought it wouldn't matter  
If we didn't stay together,  
And if it was over,  
Maybe it was for the better.  
I was thinking I'd be alright,  
'til I thought it all through.  
Now I know that I ain't really living  
If I have to live without you.  
  
I don't want to live without your love,  
I don't want to face the night alone.  
I could never make it through my life  
If I had to make it on my own.  
I don't want to love nobody else,  
I don't want to find somebody new.  
I don't want to live without your love,  
I just want to live my life with you.  
  
Guess I had to go away,  
So much I had to go through.  
Guess I had to lose you  
To realize how much I love you.  
Can we make the fire burn again,  
Burn a little stronger?  
'cause I've been alone, and baby,  
I can't be alone now any longer.  
  
I don't want to live without your love,  
I don't want to face the night alone.  
I could never make it through my life  
If I had to make it on my own.  
I don't want to love nobody else,  
I don't want to find somebody new.  
I don't want to live without your love,  
I just want to live my life with you.  
  
Oh, if I had to make it on my own,  
My life would never be the same,  
My love would never be the same.  
I don't want to live without your love.  
  
[chorus repeats]

I don't want your money  
It don't mean a thing  
I don't need no fancy clothes  
Or a diamond ring  
I don't have to ride in style  
In your limousine  
I don't want no trouble  
Tax or Uncle Sam  
All I want is you  
I want to be your natural man  
I don't need your prestige  
'Cause I got my pride  
I don't want your social standing  
I'd rather stand outside  
I don't have no time to worry  
'Bout your greedy jive  
I don't want your money  
I don't like that game  
All I want is you  
I want to be your natural man

I saw three ships come sailing by  
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day.  
I saw three ships come sailing by  
On Christmas Day in the morning.  
  
And what was in those ships all three  
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day?  
And what was in those ships all three  
On Christmas Day in the morning?  
  
The Virgin Mary and Christ were there  
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day.  
The virgin Mary and Christ were there  
On Christmas Day in the morning.

Hey there everybody  
Please don't romp or roam  
We're a little nervous  
'Cause we're so far from home  
So this is what we do  
Sit back and let us groove  
And let us work on you  
  
We've all spent years preparing  
before this band was born  
With heaven's help it blended  
And we do thank the lord.  
  
Now we put you through the changes  
And turned around the mood  
We hope it's struck you different  
And hope you feel moved  
So forget about your troubles  
As we search for something new  
And we play for you

Jenny  
Jenny  
You know I'm goin' away  
And you know my woman's here  
Please don't you stray  
Watch over her  
  
You can run and bark and play  
Your whole life through  
And you can chase the cats around  
'Cause she loves that too  
If someone comes to cause her harm  
You will protect her too  
Oh Jenny  
  
Jenny  
Jenny  
You got her while I'm gone  
Time moves so slow  
For someone who's alone  
So comfort her  
  
If she's feelin' low  
You gotta be a card  
And if she's fast asleep  
Don't you sleep too hard  
If someone comes to cause her harm  
You gotta cut 'em down  
Oh Jenny  
  
Now maybe  
It's gonna be alright  
Won't have to fight  
Won't have to bite  
But then again  
So sad but true  
There's always someone waiting  
Just to shit on you  
  
And if she's fast asleep  
Don't you sleep too hard  
If someone comes to cause her harm  
You gotta cut 'em down  
Oh Jenny  
  
Now maybe  
It's gonna be alright  
You won't have to fight  
Never have to bite  
But then again  
You know it's sad but true  
There's always someone waiting  
Just to shit on you

Jolly old Saint Nicholas lean your ear this way  
Don't you tell a single soul what I'm going to say  
Christmas Eve is coming soon now you dear old man  
Whisper what you'll bring to me, tell me if you can  
  
When the clock is striking twelve, when I'm fast asleep  
Down the chimney broad and black with your pack you'll creep  
All the stockings you will find hanging in a row  
Mine will be the shortest one you'll be sure to know  
  
What's it gonna be, Santa  
Underneath the tree, Santa  
What's it gonna be, Santa  
Be this year for me  
  
Jolly old Saint Nicholas now you dear old man  
Whisper what you'll bring to me, tell me if you can  
  
What's it gonna be, Santa  
Underneath the tree, Santa  
What's it gonna be, Santa  
Be this year for me  
  
Jason wants a Fender bass, Walt a saxaphone  
Lee he needs a fluglehorn, Jimmy a trombone  
Robert wants a baby grand, Bill a new B3  
Tris, he wants a dolly, but  
What are you gonna bring to me, Santa  
  
What's it gonna be, Santa  
Underneath the tree, Santa  
What's it gonna be, Santa  
Be this year for me  
  
What's it gonna be, Santa  
Underneath the tree, Santa  
What's it gonna be, Santa  
Be this year for me  
How about a shiny electric guitar, Santa

Say no more,  
If you want to kiss goodnight,  
That's alright by me.  
Close your door,  
Make sure the latch is tight,  
Fall gently to sleep.  
  
We don't have to rush ahead,  
Putting questions in your head,  
And an ache in your heart,  
  
Let's take a lifetime,  
All that we desire,  
Build it day by day into forever.  
Let's take a lifetime,  
All that you require,  
Here and now and ever.  
  
In these times,  
Love is not some harmless game,  
It's played strictly for keeps.  
No, It's no crime,  
Wanting me to feel the same,  
With the water so deep.  
Come tomorrow once again,  
We'll be together until then,  
We've dreaming to do.  
  
Let's take a lifetime,  
All that you desire.  
Build it day by day into forever  
Let's take a lifetime,  
All that you require.  
Here and now and lasting ever more.  
  
So hard to leave you standing there in the light,  
You look so lovely.  
If we must  
No use tempting fate.

Just when I found myself  
Back against the wall  
You saved my life  
With a telephone call  
  
Far across the sea  
You thought of me  
I never thought I'd ever see  
The happy days you brought to me

Listen,  
If you think that we're here for the money  
You couldn't be right, you know(owowow)  
But the bread is not too good here  
It could be so natural  
I said all you got to do is listen  
  
Listen,  
If you don't hear what you can tell us  
If it's good you can tell us all  
Or you can smile, that's alright my friend  
It could be so nice, you know  
If only you would listen  
  
Listen,  
If you don't understand it, no no no no  
You got to try to fly  
And don't you put me down, please  
For creating beyond your mind  
I said all you got to do is listen

The moment that we met  
There was something so familiar  
I felt like I'd known you for a thousand years  
And there inside your eyes  
I saw a light that I'd been missing  
  
Somewhere deep inside  
All of the lonely disappeared  
And, baby, now you're here  
I feel like I have found  
  
[Chorus]  
A long lost friend  
That I've lived for all my life  
A gentle hand  
A part of me I've been trying to find  
And now you're here  
And the search comes to an end  
I've found my long lost friend  
  
Every move I make  
Is to the rhythm of your heartbeat  
Every single breath you take  
You take with me  
  
Oh, I ask myself  
How did I ever live before you?  
You came into my life  
And put all the pieces into place  
When I saw your face  
I knew that I had found  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Like a storm out of the blue  
Love rained down on me and you  
So complete and so unexpectedly  
Like a movie in my mind  
I've seen a hundred times  
I feel like, I've loved you before  
Long lost friend.  
  
Now you're here  
And the search comes to an end!  
  
Long lost friend  
That I've lived for all my life  
A gentle hand  
You're a part of me I was dying to find  
And now you're here  
And the search comes to an end  
I've found my long lost friend  
I've found my long lost friend  
  
Oh, now I've found you  
My lost friend oh

What you been doin, ain't you got no one  
Where you been keepin' yourself my friend  
Have you been hidin' underground riding  
Foolin' yourself in your special way  
Where's your old lady  
She was a nice girl  
Maybe it's best that she went away  
You have been losin' nothing can change you  
Hapiness spits in your face always  
Where are you going, what will you see there  
You never learn nothin' by runnin' away  
What you been doin, ain't you got no one  
Where you been keepin' yourself my friend  
Loneliness growin', emptiness showin'  
Finding your peace two or three times a day  
Three times a day

Many miles of memories, many tears I can't forget  
But I know you live inside me yet, oh  
Many hours to contemplate many dreams I can't recall  
Many nights I've felt I was too small  
Nothing more than a loser with a broken heart, yeah  
Nothing more than a loser with a broken heart, yeah, yeah  
It's a hard and bitter world when you face reality  
And it's hard to be who you want to be, oh  
Many miles of memories catch the wind and blow away  
But I know that it's over, over anyway, oh  
But tonight I sit and wonder why you left me here  
After all this time I don't know why you left me here  
If it's all behind me, you know you'll find me, oh  
Nothing more than a loser with a broken heart, yeah  
Nothing more than a loser with a broken heart, oh yeah  
But tonight, I sit, wonder why you left me here  
After all this time I wonder why, wonder why you left me here  
If it's all behind me, you know you'll find me, oh, oh  
Nothing more than a loser with a broken heart, yeah  
Nothing more than a loser with a broken heart, oh yeah  
Nothing more than a loser with a broken heart, yeah  
(I'm a loser)  
Nothing more than a loser with a broken heart, oh yeah  
(I'm a loser)  
Nothing more than a loser with a broken heart, yeah  
(I'm a loser)  
Nothing more than a loser with a broken heart, oh yeah  
(I'm a loser)  
Nothing more than a loser with a broken heart, yeah  
(I'm a loser)  
Nothing more than a loser with a broken heart, oh yeah  
(I'm a loser)

You can sentence me to life  
If love is a crime baby  
I'd do my time  
Whether it's wrong or right  
You can sentence me  
Sentence me to life  
  
Some might say I'm guilty of love in the first degree  
If the jury wants to lock me up and throw away the key  
There's no greater punishment than what I face inside  
Won't tamper with the evidence cause there's nothing to hide  
  
He lives inside my heart  
I'm in the middle too

Swear tell the truth, just let me plead my case  
The thief who stole my heart from me I couldn't let escape  
He's my only alibi, but I won't drop a dime  
So how can I give up to you, my partner in crime  
  
He lives inside my heart  
I'm in the middle too  
You never had a clue  
Unless you felt it too  
  
If love is a crime baby

'Cause my heart will set me free

She said, "It's lonely here tonight"  
She's always sad when she's alone  
She said "I need you here tonight"  
She couldn't wait 'til I get home  
She loves me  
And that's all I need to know  
She's part of my life  
Just a part I won't let go  
  
Then she said  
"Love me tomorrow  
Won't you please, promise me  
Love me tomorrow like today  
Love me tomorrow  
Hurry back, can't you see  
I need you more than yesterday"  
  
You know it's always cold at night  
It's always lonely 'til the dawn  
You know it's not what we put on  
Knowing she's there, I'll carry on  
Because she loves me  
And that's all I need ato know  
She's part of my life  
Just a part I won't let go  
  
Then she said  
"Love me tomorrow  
Won't you please, promise me  
Love me tomorrow like today  
Love me tomorrow  
Hurry back, can't you see  
I need you more than any words could say"  
  
She loves me  
And that's all I need to know  
She's part of my life  
Just a part I won't let go  
  
Then she said  
"Love me tomorrow

Love me tomorrow  
Love me tomorrow like today  
Love me tomorrow  
I need you much more than yesterday  
Love me tomorrow  
Love me tomorrow like today"

Remember when we were first falling in love  
How we planned all the things we would do  
Beautiful days and the nights all ablaze  
Hoping our dreams would come true  
Love was new  
Remember the house at the top of the hill  
How the sunlight caressed all the trees  
I played all my music I sang you my love  
The chiming church bells rode the breeze  
Love was new  
Time has a way of obscuring our memories  
And good times are hard to recall  
Basic survival and day to day living  
Leaves no time for romance at all  
I just wanted to say I'm still falling in love  
Every day with you, every day  
Remember that Christmas with just a few friends  
And the whole town was covered with snow  
We laughed and we loved as we skied in the sun  
It seems such a long time ago  
Love was new  
Something you said one night started me thinking  
How sweet love is as it begins  
Taken for granted it slips through your fingers  
And leaves you on needles and pins  
But there ain't no way baby that we'd let that happen  
Our love will always be new  
I just wanted to say I'm still falling in love  
Every day with you,falling in love every day with you

I don't love you anymore  
We've all heard those words before  
Somebody takes your heart and then  
Leaves you the pieces  
  
Lying shattered on the floor  
They say that when you close a door  
Another one is waiting there  
For you to open, if you believe!  
  
[Chorus]  
Love will come back  
Hit you when you least expect it  
Fill in the cracks  
Of a broken heart you thought  
That you could never mend  
You, you can start again!  
  
When you're barely getting by  
And it's hard to find the strength to try  
And loneliness is all you've known  
If you let go, then you will find  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, when you think you've lost the only way  
All you really need  
Is a little faith  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Just let love return to you  
You can start again!

I can feel the magic  
Suddenly it's all around  
I can see it clearly  
I can even hear the sound  
  
It's all so new to me  
I'm not the same  
If this is love  
Then you're to blame  
  
Mama mama when you look at me  
I see love in your eyes  
Mama mama softly sweet tender love in your eyes  
  
You are all I live for  
Maybe that's enough to say  
And you're the one I wrote this song for  
Everywhere and everyway  
  
It's all so new to me  
I'm not the same  
It's words I feel  
But can't explain  
  
Mama mama when you look at me  
I see love in your eyes  
Mama mama softly sweet tender love in your eyes  
  
Mama mama, mama mama  
I really love you  
I really need you  
Mama mama, mama mama  
I really need you mama  
I really love you mama

I stand at your gate and the song that I sing is of moonlight  
I stand and I wait for the touch of your hand in the June night  
The roses are sighing a moonlight serenade  
  
The stars are a glow and tonight how their light sets me dreaming  
My love, do you know that your eyes are like stars brightly beaming?  
I bring you and sing you a moonlight serenade  
  
Let us stray till break of day in love's valley of dreams  
Just you and I a summer sky, a heavenly breeze kissing the trees  
So don't let me wait come to me tenderly in the June night  
I stand at your gate and I sing you a song in the moonlight  
A love song, my darling, a moonlight serenade  
We can stay, till break of day

We know it's hard for you to see  
That this is all we want to be  
A constant urge within us grows  
To do the thing that we propose  
We tried so hard to make the grade  
By making music day to day  
Although our task is never done  
You ought to know it's just begun  
And now it's time for us to say  
But most of all we like to play  
A song or two that makes you feel  
Like all the good in you is real  
Together now we've lots to hear  
To warm my heart to shed a tear  
So come and listen if you choose  
And feel a joy you'll never lose  
So everybody listen  
Yeah  
Everybody please give a listen  

She's fine, so fine  
And I think I'm going to lose my mind  
So high, so high,  
You know you make me want to  
Scream and shout  
Well, you know I'm like a fool  
Who's just got to have a reason  
You know that I've found mine  
Must have been crazy  
Must have been crazy, yeah  
Must have been crazy  
To have done this so long  
This time, it's time  
Every singer's got to sing his song  
So fine, it's fine  
You know you make me want to  
Sing along  
'cause you know I'm not a fool  
Got to find a piece of heaven  
You know that I found mine  
Must have been crazy  
Must have been crazy, yeah  
Must have been crazy  
To have done this so long  
'cause you know I'm not a fool  
Got to find a piece of heaven  
You know that I found mine  
Must have been crazy  
Must have been crazy, yeah  
Must have been crazy  
To have done this so long  

Roxie: There's only one person who can help ya now, Roxie  
Velma: There's only one person you can count on now, Velma  
  
And now, Miss Roxie Hart and Miss Velma Kelly sing a song  
Of unrelenting determination and unmitigated ego  
  
One thing I know  
One thing I know  
And I've always known  
And I've always known  
I am my own  
I am my own  
Best friend  
  
Baby's alive  
Baby's alive  
But baby's alone  
But baby's alone  
And baby's her own  
And baby's her own  
Best friend  
  
Many's the guy  
Who told me he cares  
But they were scratchin' my back  
'Cause I was scratchin' theirs  
  
And trusting to luck  
And trusting to luck  
That's only for fools  
Only for fools  
I play in a game  
I play in a game  
Where I make the rules  
  
And rule number one  
From here to the end  
Is I am my own best friend'  
  
Three musketeers  
Who never say die  
Are standing here this minute  
Me  
Me  
Myself  
Myself  
And I  
And I  
  
If life is a school I'll pass every test  
If life is a game I'll play it the best  
'Cause I wont give in and I'll never bend  
And I am my own best friend

I've never been in love before  
Not like this you taught me more  
Hung out by myself  
Well I lived upon a shelf  
And cried 'cause I thought I could not give  
My pride would not let me live  
All my feelings disappeared  
You are lovely reason I  
Am alive you satisfy  
All my senses and you give  
Me the confidence to grow  
In a thousand different ways  
Happy just to spend the days  
Of my lifetime by your side  
I want to be  
Everything that I can  
I want so much  
To be more of a man  
I want to grow  
I want to know you better  
Each day I'll try  
To love you  
'Cause I've never been in love before  
You have a friend for life in me  
If we ever disagree  
And you have to go away  
I will set you free with joy  
'Cause your happiness is mine  
May our light forever shine  
May you always feel free  
I want to be  
Everything that I can  
I want so much  
To be more of a man  
I want to live  
I want to give my lifetime  
Each day I'll try  
To love you  
'Cause I've never been in love before

Baby, so you think you can start again?  
You got somebody new,  
But the same thing keeps happening.  
At the moment of truth,  
Whoever you're loving,  
You will be thinking of me.  
  
[Chorus:]  
As long as Niagara falls,  
As long as Gibraltar stands,  
'Til Hell freezes over  
I'll always be your man.  
  
Tell me, when you're there lying by his side.  
Do you make him believe all your needs have been satisfied?  
Does he know that your heart is taken forever?  
Girl, you will always be mine.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Time can't erase  
What you feel in your heart  
You can't replace the love  
No, it doesn't matter how hard you try.  
Girl, you're gonna miss my loving till the day you die.  
'Til Hell freezes over  
  
[Chorus]  
  
As long as Niagara falls,  
Until the end of time,  
'Til Hell freezes over,  
You are forever mine.  
  
[Chorus]

Pretty smile lovely face and a warm breeze now I need you lady  
You're my no tell lover  
Every night in a different place I'll meet you tender lady  
You're my no tell lover  
  
Everyone keeps tellin' me that this affair's not meant to be  
Even though I need you night and day  
Walk away if you see me coming, even if it's you I'm lovin'  
  
Every minute is an hour every day's a lonely lifetime  
You're my no tell lover  
The little time that we spend together just can't last forever  
You're my no tell lover  
  
Everyone keeps tellin' me that this affair's not meant to be  
Even though I need you night and day  
Walk away if you see me coming even though it's you I'm lovin'  
I want her  
I can't leave her  
I won't live without her  
There's nothing left to say  
I want her  
I can't leave her  
  
Pretty smile, lovely face and a warm breeze now I need you lady  
You're my no tell lover  
Every night in a different place I'll need you tender lady  
You're my no tell lover  
  
Everyone keeps tellin' me this affair's not meant to be  
Even though I need you night and day  
Walk away if you see me coming even though it's you I'm lovin'  
  
I want her  
I can't leave her  
I won't live without her  
She's my no tell lover

Nowadays

Everywhere life, everywhere joy, everywhere nowadays

Isn't it swell, isn't it

Roxie and velma  
And all that jazz!

Pulling myself out of a dead sleep  
With the impression of the dream still fresh in my mind  
Before I'm even awake, the words, the music were complete  
  
I woke up that mornin'  
Feelin' so rested and new  
My mind was clear of all the problems  
That been hasslin' my head  
I couldn't quite understand why  
I felt so fine  
I felt so free  
So beyond it all  
As I turned towards the bed  
I understood as it all came clear  
  
As I turned towards the bed  
I understood as it all came clear  
  
I saw myself lyin' there  
Didn't have a care  
Piece of mind was finally mine  
Now free to fly  
Into the blue sky  
Oh great spirit  
Fly away  
Oh great spirit  
Just fly  
Fly  
Oh fly away

Oh girl  
I looked you over once or twice  
I think that you are very nice  
And you're just meant for me  
Oh girl  
I think you got a messed up mind  
But if you will take the time  
Baby I can set you free  
Well I'm not trying to be  
What I am not  
But I think what you need  
Is what I got  
Girl I'm no philosopher  
But I can offer you that cure  
To mend your broken heart  
I know that you are not blind  
I know you see my messed up mind  
I bet you see my broken heart too  
So won't you  
Bring your heart and your mind  
That's out on the run  
Fuse them with my broken heart  
In my mind  
We'll be one  
Girl I looked you over once or twice  
I think that you are very nice  
And you're just meant for me  
Girl I think you got a messed up mind  
Now that you know yours is just like mine  
Baby, won't you set me free  

I'm movin' too fast, the pace of things has got to change  
I never have time to think of words I want to say  
I look around me, I don't know who really knows  
What does it matter anyway?  
  
Sometimes I feel like I've got a heart made out of stone  
And somedays I feel so alone  
When nobody sees what's going on anymore  
If I could just know that someone's there  
  
One from the heart that's all it takes  
One to hold you, one who knows you  
One to one together  
One from the heart, one for each day  
One to lean on, one to keep on  
  
Keep on getting stronger the more I see your face  
It's never too late to get to where I want to go  
It's never too late to get to love someone  
All that I need is to be more than yesterday  
  
And all I can give along the way  
One from the heart that's all it takes  
One to hold you, one who knows you  
One to one together  
One from the heart, one for each day  
One to lean on, one to keep on  
  
The words you will remember  
The words you'll hear me say  
It's all about love  
It's all about give and take

Listen to the wind  
Hear the voice inside you.  
Something in the air,  
Something you've been blind to.  
People everywhere are dying to be free.  
Time has come to live our lives in harmony.  
Chorus:  
Give the children of the world one more day,  
Give the children of the world, give them one more day.  
Where do we begin?  
When will freedom find us?  
Bring the new day in  
Free the chains that bind us.  
People reaching out for just a little more.  
Love is all we need to open up the door.  
Chorus  
Now the future's up to you.  
Take a stand and see things through  
For the children of tomorrow.  
Give the world one more day,  
Time enough to find a way  
To start over a way to go on.  
One more day  
One more day  
Give the children of the world  
One more day  
One more day  
One more day  
Give the children of tomorrow  
One more day  

One more sad tomorrow  
And I'm not very good  
At hiding my sorrow  
It's not the same without you  
So alone and so afraid  
I thought we had it made  
What about us  
What about the way  
We were so in love  
When we were together  
I thought you'd never leave  
Now I know this time you're gone, forever  
[Chorus:]  
Only love can break your heart  
Fill you with desire  
And tear you all apart  
Only love can make you cry  
Only love knows why  
One more night without you  
I'm just trying to pretend  
That you're coming back again  
You know I never meant to doubt you (Oh no..)  
We were young and we were free  
Now I can't believe this could happen to me  
What about us  
What about the way  
We were so in love  
When we were together  
I thought you'd never leave  
Now I know this time you're gone, forever  
[Chorus:]  
[Bridge:]  
Tell me who will I turn to  
When I get in trouble  
Oh babe I don't want you to go  
Tell me who can I turn to  
When I get in trouble  
Baby please don't leave me  
Can't you see you must believe me  
[Chorus:]  
What

You hear a sound as she's leaving  
You'll hear your heart pound so hard  
You'll miss her warm touch and the way things once were  
It's such a cold town when you miss her  
  
It's not the same place no more  
When it's hard to mend what's broken  
And you still can't let her go  
Beyond the storm there's an answer  
  
Beyond the nights you spend alone  
Beyond the headlights and the highways you go  
You'll take a long ride without her  
Until the tears dry away  
  
In every way you try to reason  
When there's no reason left to hold  
Only time can heal the wounded of love  
Any day now time will tell  
  
Only love can turn it all around again  
There's no heart that time can't heal  
Whatever pieces you're missing  
Whatever you leave behind  
  
However you look at things they do change  
It's not the same conversation  
It's not the way that it was  
There'll be one less tear tomorrow  
There'll be one less night alone  
  
Only time can heal the wounded of love  
Any day now time will tell  
Only love can turn it all around again  
There's no heart that time can't heal  
Only time can heal the wounded of love  
There's no heart that time can't heal

Hold me forever  
Whisper the words I've waited so long to hear  
Love's sweet surrender  
Steals an embrace and kisses away the tears  
  
Lookin' back down the road of love  
We can still feel the heartache  
Pain and joy of an unrelenting love  
Hold us together  
  
[Chorus]  
Only you  
You've got control  
Only you  
You've got the key to my heart  
Only you  
You've got control  
Need your love, take me forever  
  
Sad empty faces  
Faded away when I fell in love with you  
True love erases  
Fear and the doubt not knowing we'd see things through  
  
So in  
In a world of illusion  
We fell in love until the end of time  
True love, forever  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Lookin' back down the road of love  
We can still feel the heartache  
Pain and joy of an unrelenting love  
Hold us together  
  
[Chorus]

Fireworks,  
Fireflys,  
On the roof watching summer night skies.  
All the boys,  
All the girls,  
All the time making love with our eyes.  
Life just went on for us  
Day after day  
We could fly!- oh!  
Cocky, so confident  
There was no way we could die.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Over, over and over again.  
Life is a circle,  
But it's over and over again.  
Over, over.  
  
Little words,  
Little games,  
The dramas we played, left behind.  
Little friends,  
Little names,  
Puppy lovers we had...(love was blind).  
Life just went on for us d  
Ay after day  
Screaming by!- oh!  
Fast as a shooting star  
Cruising the midnight sky!  
  
[Chorus]

Come on in, have a look around  
Hang your hat and find a chair  
The pretty women smile at you  
The party's just beginning  
There's music everywhere  
Paradise alley  
Paradise alley  
Paradise alley  
Brothers got to stick together here  
Fight with one, you fight with three  
The family blood is thick as mud  
Day to day the world keeps spinning  
Paradise alley  
Paradise alley  
Paradise alley  
It reminds you of who you used to be  
And who you are, and who you'll always be  
It finds you in pursuit of dreams  
And hopeless schemes  
Life is richer than it seems  
Nothing like being in a woman's arms  
The one you love, the one you want  
There's one small problem, who can she be  
I feel like winning her in paradise alley  
Paradise alley  
Paradise alley  
I'm gonna take you there  
Paradise alley  
Paradise alley  
I'm gonna take you there  
Take you to the paradise

Some will say it's too late,  
So don't change the story.  
There's too much at stake to grow.  
Yesterday was so great,  
Just bask in the glory.  
Don't let your feelings show.  
  
And I say,  
"Oh Yeah" like a man with condition  
I wait for my heart to stop.  
Stay down,  
Got a plan hold that position.  
You can't afford a flop.  
  
Pack my suitcase  
With my game face,  
Take the same place,  
And put away the dreams I had.  
Let my hair grow,  
Find some old clothes,  
Let the world know  
That my glory days were plaid.  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm not asking for permission,  
Are you ready for me to be me.  
Just pass the ammunition,  
This prisoner's about to bust free from chains.  
  
For so long you told me to keep it familiar,  
Just play what they all would find,  
I can wear this blindfold, stick to your story,  
But I gotta ask myself why.  
And I play those songs!  
For so many seasons,  
Till I'm sure I'm losing my mind.  
And I say, Oh no,  
Gotta have a much better reason  
To leave all my dreams behind.  
  
Strangers,  
Rearrange us,  
Stay the same fate,  
And become your favorite fad.  
With the see-through,  
I gotta be true,  
I can't be you.  
While Yes still comes in plaid.  
  
[Chorus].  
  
I'm more than just excited,  
Like a hundred pounds of monkey on my back.  
Now everybody's divided,  
We're riding this train till we run clear out of track.  
Clean of track.  
  
[Chorus]

Everyday he wakes up  
As his bare feet hit the floor  
Grabs a cup of coffee  
Straps his Magnum on once more  
Feeds the cat he lives with  
Since his wife walked out the door  
In nine years he'll retire with a pension  
Everyday he suffers  
'Cause he sees all kinds of pain  
Sometimes feels helpless  
In a world that's gone insane  
Then he wins a battle  
It restores his faith again  
It's only human kindness he is after  
He is a policeman, you know  
All the years and nothing to show  
He is a policeman, you know  
Every night he comes home  
With a sixpack all alone  
Feeds the cat he lives with  
He picks up the telephone  
Needs to talk with someone  
But the only love he's known  
Was lost forever, he is a policeman  
He is a policeman, you know  
All the years and nothing to show  
He is a policeman, you know  
All the years and nothing to show

You've got the look, they'll never forget  
You want to be noticed, but they haven't noticed yet  
  
When the time is right, a star on your door  
Taking you places that you've never been before  
Where did you go?  
  
[Chorus]  
Go to sleep tonight and dream about it till the morning  
Make a scene tonight, read about it in the morning  
Appearing for the very first time, on the screen tonight  
And when you want to, they treat you like a Prima Donna  
  
You're a movie queen, familiar face  
Prettiest woman in the whole of the human race  
  
You're gonna be famous, you want to go far  
Name up in lights, everybody knows who you are  
On with the show  
  
How will it feel being number one  
Hard to imagine but I can't blame you for tryin'  
How will it feel havin' so much fun  
Hard to imagine but it's so electrifying  
  
[Chorus]

It's all show business kid  
These trials, the whole world, show business  
But kid, you're workin' with a star, the biggest  
  
Give 'em the old razzle dazzle  
Razzle dazzle 'em  
Give 'em an act with lots of flash in it  
And the reaction will be passionate  
  
Give 'em the old hocus pocus  
Bead and feather 'em  
How can they see with sequins in their eyes?  
What if your hinges all are rusting?  
What if, in fact, you're just disgusting?  
  
Razzle dazzle 'em  
And they'll never catch wise  
  
Give 'em the old razzle dazzle  
Razzle dazzle 'em  
Back since the days of old Methuselah  
Everyone loves the big bamboozler  
  
Give 'em the old three ring circus  
Stun and stagger 'em  
When you're in trouble, go into your dance  
Though you are stiffer than a girder  
They let you get away with murder  
  
Razzle dazzle 'em  
And you've got a romance  
  
Give 'em the old razzle dazzle  
Razzle dazzle 'em  
Give 'em an act that's unassailable  
They'll wait a year 'till you're available  
  
Give 'em the old, double whammy  
Daze and dizzy 'em  
Show 'em the first rate sorcerer you are  
Long as you keep 'em way off balance  
How can they spot, you got no talents?  
  
Razzle dazzle 'em, razzle dazzle 'em  
And they'll make you a star

Shadows were hiding what I couldn't see  
Out in the dark - she was calling to me  
Calling to me with a voice I'd never forget  
  
She was a vision I couldn't believe  
I held her close wo that she wouldn't leave  
Suddenly hopeless - hopelessly falling in love  
  
Chorus:  
I remember the feeling  
I remember the way  
She came and wrapped her arms around me  
Told me that she cared  
Said she'd always be there  
  
Taking me places that I've never been  
She had the beauty that comes from within  
Was I just dreaming was it too good to be true  
  
I was a man all alone in the night  
She came along and she showed me the light  
I was confused then she told me the way  
I was alone and I begged her to stay  
  
She was alive I was caught by the fire  
She brought emotions that filled my desire  
I should have noticed that something was wrong  
When I awoke she was gone  
  
Chorus  
  
She was alive I was caught by the fire  
She brought emotions that filled my desire  
I should have noticed that something was wrong  
When I awoke, I could see that she was gon

The name on everybody's lips is gonna be... Roxie  
The lady raking in the chips is gonna be... Roxie.  
I'm gonna be a celebrity,  
That means somebody everyone knows  
They're gonna recognise my eyes,  
My hair, my teeth, my boobs, my nose.  
  
From just some dumb mechanic's wife I'm gonna be... Roxie  
Who says that murder's not an art.  
And who in case she doesn't hang,  
Can say she started with a bang.  
Roxie Hart.  
  
Boys...  
They're gonna wait outside in lines to get to see...  
Roxie  
Think of those autographs I'll sign, "Good luck to ya!"  
Roxie  
And I'll appear in a lavaleir that goes all the way down to my waist,  
Here a ring, there a ring every where a ring a ling  
But always in the best of taste.  
  
Mmmm, I'm a star...  
And the audience loves me,  
And I love them.  
And they love me for lovin' them  
And I love them for lovin' me  
And we love each other  
And that's 'cause none of us got enough love in our childhoods  
And that's showbiz...  
Kid  
  
She's givin' up her humdrum life  
I'm gonna be, sing it!  
Roxie  
She made a scandal and a start  
And Sophie Tucker'll shit I know  
To see her name get billed below
