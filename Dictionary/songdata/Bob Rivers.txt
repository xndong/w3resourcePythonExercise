(Riders On The Storm - Doors)  
  
Burgers on the grill  
Burgers on the grill  
I've really had my fill  
Of burgers on the grill  
When the relatives go home  
I'm stuck with chicken bones  
And burgers on the grill  
  
There's a steak tip on the coals  
It fell down through the holes  
And now it's caught on fire  
Smells like a funeral pyre  
I was tryin' to get it back  
But it's turnin' pretty black  
Steak tip on the coals  
  
Yeah!  
  
Wiener on the foil  
The skin begins to boil  
I dropped it in the soil  
I thought that it was spoiled  
So I washed it with a hose  
And fed it to Aunt Rose  
Wiener on the foil  
  
Burgers on the grill  
Burgers on the grill

('Well, hello, Mickey17 here.')  
('I'm uh, 17 years old.')  
('Yeah, tall, blonde hair, blue eyes. People tell me I look like one of the
Backstreet Boys.')  
('Which one? Uh, Huey or maybe Dewey'.)  
('I'd like to meet you too. What are you doing in 8 to 10 years?')  
  
It was dark in my room  
Like an ancient tomb  
'cept the monitor burnin' bright  
I was tryin' to meet girls on the internet  
But I hadn't had a doggone bite  
  
I was looking for love at 56K  
Typin' smut from town to town  
Said 'I'm a twenty-two year old college coed  
And I'm about to pull my panties down.'  
  
'Cuz were in a little chat room  
Typing through the night  
My left hands' on my mouse and  
I'm tickling the keys with my right  
Come on and join our chat room  
Who you wanna to be today?  
Thoughts go around this chat room  
Anything's okay  
  
Chat room  
Chat room  
  
('Well! What a coincidence. I am a lesbian too.')  
  
By the time the sun was comin' up  
I'd met girls from all 50 states  
Typin' 40 words a minute with just one hand  
So the other could co-allate  
  
Yeah, them keys was humming  
Like a Whitehouse intern  
Toying with a chick in Belair  
But the truth made me sick  
She sent me a pic  
And it had a lot of mustache hair  
  
'Cuz we're in a great big chat room  
Typing through the night  
Got me a chat room pen pal  
Hope she's a beautiful sight  
Come on and join our chat room  
Who you gonna meet today  
Try your luck in the chat room  
Across the cyberspace  
  
Chat Room  
Chat Room  
Chat Room'  
  
('I received your jpeg. Please resend. The photo appears to have smudged. It
looks like you have a mustache'Hahaha LOL.')  
('Perhaps we could meet in a more private room?')  
('Back door?')  
('Chip, is that you? You get your ass to bed before I come up there and
disconnect your mo-dem!')

Fat and docile, big and dumb  
They look so stupid, they aren't much fun  
Cows aren't fun  
  
They eat to grow, grow to die  
Die to be et at the hamburger fry  
Cows well done  
  
Nobody thunk it, nobody knew  
No one imagined the great cow guru  
Cows are one  
  
He hid in the forest, read books with great zeal  
He loved Che Guevara, a revolutionary veal  
Cow Tse Tung  
  
He spoke about justice, but nobody stirred  
He felt like an outcast, alone in the herd  
Cow doldrums  
  
He mooed "We must fight, escape or we'll die"  
Cows gathered around, cause the steaks were so high  
Bad cow pun  
  
But then he was captured, stuffed into a crate  
Loaded onto a truck, where he rode to his fate  
Cows are bummed  
  
He was a scrawny calf, who looked rather woozy  
No one suspected he was packing an Uzi  
Cows with guns  
  
They came with a needle to stick in his thigh  
He kicked for the groin, he pissed in their eye  
Cow well hung  
  
Knocked over a tractor and ran for the door  
Six gallons of gas flowed out on the floor  
Run cows run!  
  
He picked up a bullhorn and jumped up on the hay  
We are free roving bovines, we run free today  
  
We will fight for bovine freedom  
And hold our large heads high  
We will run free with the buffalo, or die  
Cows with guns  
  
They crashed the gate in the great stampede  
Tipped over a milk truck, torched all the feed  
Cows have fun  
  
Sixty police cars were piled in a heap  
Covered in cow pies, covered up deep  
Much cow dung  
  
Black smoke rising, darkening the day  
Twelve burning Mcdonalds, have it your way  
  
We will fight for bovine freedom  
And hold our large heads high  
We will run free with the Buffalo, or die  
Cows with guns  
  
The President said "enough is enough  
These uppity cattle, it's time to get tough"  
Cow dung flung  
  
The newspapers gloated, folks sighed with relief  
Tomorrow at noon, they would all be ground beef  
Cows on buns  
  
The cows were surrounded, they waited and prayed  
They mooed their last moos, they chewed their last hay  
Cows out gunned  
  
The order was given to turn cows to whoppers  
Enforced by the might of ten thousand coppers  
But on the horizon surrounding the shoppers  
Came the deafening roar of chickens in choppers  
  
We will fight for bovine freedom  
And hold our large heads high  
We will run free with the Buffalo, or die  
Cows with guns

Please,  
Don't put out this turd.  
It's a piece of crap to me  
Can hardly hear the words...  
  
Whatever happened to,  
The rights to Love me Do?  
We made Michael Jackson one rich mother.  
John wouldn't like this much,  
We used him as a crutch  
  
And now we feel so cheap, so...  
  
Please,  
This song's a turd,  
I'm not a Travelling Wilbury.  
This should not be heard  
I'm flipping Paul the Bird  
  
(Turned out like a piece of crap)

Frosty the pervert  
In a trench coat he did go  
To a the school yard to expose his dick and balls made of snow  
  
Frosty the pervert  
All the kids he liked to watch  
His dick did grow when he packed snow  
On his cold and icy crotch  
  
There must have must have been some magic  
When he stroked his frozen meat  
Cause frosty started moaning loud  
And it began to sleet cum and white trash pussy  
  
Frosty the pervert  
Was as glad as he could get  
He threw away his corn cob pipe  
And lit a cigarette  
  
Frosty the pervert  
Didn't want to go to jail  
He began to run  
While dripping cum  
And the cops picked up his trail  
  
Down to the village  
His dick melting in his hand  
Running here and there  
All around the square  
Yelling "catch me if you can."  
  
They chased him down the streets of town  
Right to a Vice Squad cop  
Who shoved a night stick right up his ass  
And frosty screamed "don't stop OOOO!"  
  
Frosty the pervert  
Was locked up that very day  
But he did not cry  
As he waved good bye knowing he'd be back someday  
  
Beating his meat  
All over the streets  
Look at frosty go  
  
Sliding his hands  
All over his glands  
His cum, as white as snow

I'm getting fatter all the time.  
I used to be size 32 and I never gave.  
My jeans used to fit, I looked cool.  
Now I'm not the same.  
Put on a few pounds, my shape's getting round.  
And lately I can't see my shoes.  
I hate to admit, but I'm getting fatter, fatter,  
A little fatter all the time.  
I can't lose no weight.  
Yes, I admit I'm getting fatter, fatter, I'm getting fatter.  
I love to dine. That meat's pretty cruel to my waistline.  
I'm driving a steak through my heart  
Eating things that I love.  
Man, I was lean but I dug french cuisine.  
Now I'm big as the Michelin Man.  
I admit I'm getting fatter, fatter,  
I'm getting fatter all the time.  
I can't skip desert. Now, I don't dare get on a ladder.  
Fatter, I'm getting fatter.  
It ain't no crime getting so much fatter all the time.  
I'm getting fatter all the time.  
Fatter, fatter, fatter.  
I'm getting fatter all the time.  
Fatter, fatter, fatter.  
Getting so much fatter all the time.

Have yourself an Ozzy little Christmas  
Give a bat a bite  
Decorate your devil head with twinkling lights  
(Ozzy Christmas, Ozzy family Christmas)  
Have yourself an Ozzy little Christmas  
Let the F word fly  
From now on those censors will be up all night  
(All those bad words, motherbleeping bad words)  
  
He's repented his bolder days  
His druggie ways of yore  
Faithful friends who got smashed with him, don't bring hash to him no more  
(We're pretty sure)  
Through the slurs you almost can decipher  
When he speaks aloud  
He's the hottest star among the head-bang crowd  
So have yourself an Ozzy, Ozzy, Ozzy, Ozzy, Ozzy little Christmas now

(Hello, I Love You - Doors)  
  
Hello I love you  
Lets get tested for aids  
You know I trust you  
But you can't tell these days  
Hello I love you  
Lets get tested for aids  
You know I want you  
But let's wait a few days  
  
She might look nice and sweet  
But sleeps with every guy she meets  
You might think you know some guy  
But you know guys and they always lie  
  
Hello I love you  
Lets get tested for aids  
You know I trust you  
But you can't tell these days  
Hello I love you  
And liked to get laid  
You know I want you  
But I'm deathly afraid  
  
She holds my hand and sighs  
But her hand won't satisfy  
Our thoughts are wicked  
But our legs are crossed  
And I doubt I can hold out too long  
  
The doc won't know for at least a week  
I'm like a dog locked up when my mate's in heat  
And I hope she doesn't see me drool  
Cuz I hope to use my rusty tool  
  
Hello, hello  
Hello, hello  
Hello, hello  
  
'Uh, Hullo? '  
  
'Good news Mr. Johnson, your test results are in and you're back in business.
'  
  
'Yippee! Yahoo! Yahooie! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! '  
  
I need my baby now  
Let's go  
Hello, hello  
Hello, hello  
The lizard king is back

And now, I'm going to do a song with great social and political influence.  
It goes like this...  
Oh Lord, won't you buy me a Honda Accord.  
Mercedes insurance I cannot afford.  
If I drove a Porche, I'd still be ignored.  
So oh Lord, won't you buy me a Honda Accord.  
Oh Lord, won't you buy me some silicone implants.  
The breasts that you gave me don't shake when I dance.  
Them doctors make mountains out of hills made for ants.  
So oh Lord, won't you buy me some silicone implants.  
Oh Lord, won't you buy me a good looking male.  
My boyfriend is lazy, and big as a whale.  
Spends all of my money (when he's not in jail).  
Oh Lord, won't you buy me a good looking male...  
Everybody...  
Oh Lord, won't you buy me a Honda Accord.  
Mercedes insurance I cannot afford.  
My car's held together by a big bungee cord...  
So oh Lord, won't you buy me a Honda Accord.  
That's it

Lately all the songs I write  
Are slow and on the mellow side.  
I used to stand on MTV,  
But now they bring a chair for me.  
Let me get a tube of ointment  
Let's rub my achy joints,  
And turn my hearing aid loud,  
And throw Depends into the crowd.  
This must be how it feels,  
This must be how it feels,  
To get old.  
If I try to play hard rock,  
It'd probably put me into shock.  
Don't expect no big drum fills,  
The drummer's lost his motor skills.  
So let's get to the point,  
I'm as mellow as the Doobies.  
And when I head to the commode,  
I just pray that I can go.  
And this must be how it feels,  
To be old.

I am Santa Claus  
Ho ho ho ho ho  
Flying Through the snow  
Can you hear him ho ho ho  
He's so full of cheer  
Only has to work one day a year  
Children in their beds  
Visions of sugar plums fill their heads  
So many kids out there  
Santa must be a billionare  
Red suit, boots of black  
Big sack of toys hanging off his back  
How much does he weigh  
How do the reindeer pull his sleigh  
Nobody sees him  
As he travels the world  
Leaving his presents  
For the good boys and girls  
Ho ho ho ho ho  
Sees every move you make  
Better be good for goodness sake  
Leave him cookies and beer  
He'll be back to your house first next year  
I am Santa Claus  
Ho ho ho ho ho

I Love Your Breasts The Way They Are  
(I Love You Just The Way You Are-Billy Joel)  
  
Don't go padding your bra to please me  
You never had much chest before mmmm  
And don't imagine your hoots is Jewed-ah  
'cuz I don't need a whole lot more  
  
Oh You'd probably leave me if they were bigger  
Your bust would keep me from your heart mmmmm  
I'd miss the good times. I love the flat times  
I love your breasts the way they are  
  
I need to know that you will always wear  
A trainer a-cup 32  
Oh  
How could you think that they're not pleasing me  
The way that I've been squeezing you  
  
Woah, I don't want heaving mounds of cleavage  
I never want to work that hard  
Ohhhh  
I just want something that I can fondle  
I love your breasts the way they are  
Ohhhhhhh

You loved us when the band was hot.  
And now we're gonna give it one more shot.  
We're gettin' old,  
We must be crazy.  
  
We're puttin' on the makeup again.  
It covers up a buncha wrinkled skin.  
You bring the bread,  
We'll make the gravy.  
  
You keep on standin',  
We'll keep on singin.  
  
I used to rock and roll all night  
But now my hair's turning gray.  
I have to get to bed by nine,  
Rub on a tube of Ben-gay.  
  
Haven't picked up my guitar for a while,  
Not since them hula-hoops went outta style.  
It's been a while,  
I'm pretty rusty.  
  
We'll give you everything we got.  
Would you like to see my liver spots?  
You drive us home if we get sleepy.  
If the shirts keep on sellin',  
We'll keep on yellin'  
  
I used to rock and roll all night  
But now my hair's turning gray.  
I have to get to bed by nine,  
Rub in a tube of Ben-gay.  
  
I wanna rock and roll all night  
But I can't stay awake  
I'd like to rock and roll all night  
But then my body would ache.  
I'll try to rock and roll all night,  
If there's some dough to be made  
I wanna rock and roll all night,  
But I get drowsy by eight.

It's the most fattening time of the year  
With that pumpkin pie filling  
And everyone swilling down eggnog and beer  
It's the most fattening time of the year  
  
It's the lip smackingest season of all  
While your shopping you're cheating  
Impulsively eating that junk at the mall  
  
It's the heav-heaviest season of all  
  
There'll be turkeys for basting  
And stuffing for tasting  
And giblets and gravy will flow  
There'll be cookies that mom baked  
And leftover fruit cake from a Christmas a long time ago  
  
It's the scale flattening time of the year  
While your diet you're blowing  
There's calories going straight down to your rear  
It's the scale flattening time of the year  
  
There'll be after meal dosing  
And arteries closing  
Cholesterol levels will grow  
It's too cold to go jogging  
To brisk for tobogganing  
So pass me a hot buttered roll  
  
It's the most fattening time of the year  
  
All those gingerbread shingles and  
Chocolate Chris Kringle's will tremble in fear  
  
It's the most fattening time,  
It's the belt loosening time,  
It's the most fattening time of the year

You mean Santa, that boy's a bitch  
He caught my mom Christmas Eve and tried to give her kiss  
Fo' real he's no joke, that guy don't play  
He tried to ride way more than a one-horse-sleigh  
Laughin' all the way, but he's not laughin' today  
We'll jingle more than his bells, even the elves with pay  
Come christmas eve, old nick's A gonner!

Playin' Reindeer Games, hell yeah my friend  
Grab Rudolph's horns, see how far they bend  
When his nose turns red, his ass gets sent  
Back out to the woods with his faggy elf Randall  
Santa Claus wouldn't list me as nice  
In fact, he'll have me listed as 'naughty' twice  
Not cuz' of the fights, or the Christmas gift heist,  
Because of all the nog, I left on his wife  
It's time for old Nick to move and retire  
'fore we roast his nuts on a big ass fire  
Yes I'm that bad, Yes, I'm that crude  
I mean ya ass is huge, lose weight, for real dude  
All the cookies and milk, simply quite sick  
I mean, when's the last time you've seen your dick

Bite through your slip.  
Up in his room,  
Won't get to sleep.  
He's after a thrill  
Here come the sheep.  
In your bed at night,  
Marv bites, Marv bites.  
Be afraid tonight,  
Marv bites you, invites you to feast on his pipe.  
Then he wines you, then dines on you with his pearly whites...  
Marv bites.  
So cover your back,  
'Cause he's got the nerve.  
Don't go upstairs  
Or you're the hors d'oevures.  
In the dead of night,  
Marv bites, he bites.  
Speak into his mike,  
Or Marv bites.  
. And it hurts.

Shoppin' around for a Christmas tree  
At the grocery parking lot  
Every thing over 4 foot 3  
Is 'bout hundred bucks a pop  
Schlepin' around for a Christmas tree  
And I still haven't found a thing  
In a trailer I met some drunken' guy  
And we did some haggling  
  
People get that ornamental feelin' every year,  
Mom's and Dad's and kids all happy  
Till they get their hands all scratched and sappy  
  
Shoppin' around for Christmas trees  
  
What a crappy holiday  
Today they smell so fresh and green  
They'll be dead on Christmas Day  
  
You will get that ornamental feeling every year  
When you find a tree that looks real jolly,  
If you turn it round, it's as brown as Charlie's  
  
Choppin' down my Christmas tree  
In a true old-fashioned way  
Toppin' it off with a Spotted Owl  
And make hasty get away

(Can't Touch This - MC Hammer)  
  
You shouldn't touch this  
You better not touch it hu-hu  
Gonna' touch it anyway  
Cuz' it feels good ha-ha  
  
My name is Pee-Wee Herman  
And I really want to say  
I think it's peachy keen  
To be exposed like this  
So listen up boys and girls  
Your fate's in your own hands  
You only go round once in life  
So grab it while you can  
  
You shouldn't touch this  
You better not touch it  
Gonna' touch it anyway  
  
Don't cuff me  
Wait, Where we goin'?  
Don't you know who I am?

If you look up in the sky  
On the night before Christmas  
There's a big fat guy with a  
Toy sack  
Toy sack yeah yeah  
It's squeezing down through your fireplace  
Christmas Day  
A million Barbie dolls packed away  
Boxed up in a sack on a sleigh  
That jingle bell parka is as big as a whale  
They put everything into the toy sack  
They shove in a Chrysler  
And a tv from Sony  
So hurry up and pack that Shetland pony  
  
The toy sack is a magical place  
Where Santa puts the presents

"Lacey things, the wife is missing.  
Didn't ask, for her permission  
I'm wearing her clothes,  
Her silk panty hose.  
Walking around in women's underwear.  
  
In the store, there's a teddy.  
With little straps, like spagetti.  
It holds me so tight,  
Like handcuffs at night.  
Walking around in womens underwear  
  
In the office there's a guy named Melvin.  
He pretends that I am Murphy Brown.  
He'll say "Are you ready?"  
I'll say, "Woah man! Lets wait untill the wife is out of town."  
Later on, if you wanna,  
We can dress, like Madonna.  
Put on some eye shade, and join the parade.  
Walking around in women's underwear.  
  
Lacey things, missing.  
Didn't ask, permission.  
Wearing her clothes, silk panty hose.  
Walking around in women's underwear.  
Walking around in women's underwear.  
Walking around in women's underwear...... "

Wrong foot amputated  
Wrong foot amputated  
He got the wrong foot amputated  
The doctor had compassion he tried to cure my disease  
I was sweating on the way to the op room gave me sedatives to put me at ease  
They put me on a gurney in a hospital gown  
They gave me anesthetic and they set my legs down  
"You won't fell a thing" is what the doctor told me  
"We're gonna whack it off, whack it off, whack it off, whack it off"  
Hey man you must be kidding me, take a look  
He got the wrong foot amputated  
Hey you should have cut the other knee, take a bow  
He got the wrong foot amputated  
Hey that leg was mine, you mean to tell me that this stuff happens all the
time  
Hey this ain't my day
