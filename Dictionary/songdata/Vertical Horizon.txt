We started out so brand new darling  
But now it seems that nothing can change your mind  
I have seen your city lights  
But have you seen my country skies  
  
Watch the world go twirling by  
  
And perhaps it's common fears  
Or uncommon hearts  
That makes us insincere  
And torn apart  
  
But when will I learn  
Love is just my fantasy disguised  
  
[Chorus]  
An angel without wings can hardly fly  
And love without a dream it will not survive  
  
But now I can see  
I am lucky just to have a heart  
Discovery will knock you on your knees  
And lonely tears can only hope to freeze  
Yeah, they'll freeze and fall on down  
  
And so our sun is sinking low  
And your spirit's close behind  
But there's something you should know now  
(You know you're on my mind)  
That you're on my mind  
  
But where are you now  
When will you share your winter nights  
  
[Chorus]  
  
No it won't survive  
(No, it won't survive)  
No it won't survive

I saw an open door and I looked inside it  
But I'd no idea  
What you were hiding  
  
So now I'm holding the bag and it's heavy  
And the conversation stopped  
So much for friendly  
  
And if I told you I was not very good  
At making small talk when I should  
But you have one advantage over me  
At times like this I am lost at sea  
  
[Chorus]  
Why can't I see it for what it really is  
And know it like I know my name  
And if it's all the same I don't like this game  
So let's pack it up  
And call it even  
  
Well I'm not the type to speak  
Just to hear my voice  
And I'm sure you'd hear me out  
If you had the choice  
But your words keep coming out  
Never ending  
And I wonder if I'd have to shout  
The message I'm sending  
  
And if I told you I was dying of thirst  
And the sky was falling just to make it worse  
Would you just smile and continue on  
As if your mouth had a race to run  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well I'm glad we had this talk  
I feel better  
And if I've something else to say  
I'll write a letter  
  
And if I told you you were not very good  
At hearing others when you really should  
Would you just smile and push me away  
You can't be bothered there's still words to say  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Let's just call it even, even, even

Can you finally reach me  
Out beyond the blue  
I've been gone a long time  
Far away from you  
  
I can see that love alone is not enough  
If you don't believe in what you are and what you've got  
  
The tears you've cried have come to my eyes  
  
Can you, can you help me?  
'cause I went away  
Can you, can you help me?  
Or is it too late?  
Can you, can you help me?  
I'm trying to get through  
Can you, can you help me?  
'cause I wanna love you  
  
Once you've been defeated  
Once you've been defined  
Once your will is broken down  
It's so hard to feel alive  
  
But I believe that somewhere out across the fields  
I can see what is false and what is real  
  
You're the one face that holds me in place  
I can see you  
  
Can you, can you help me?  
'cause I went away  
Can you, can you help me?  
Or is it too late?  
Can you, can you help me?  
I'm trying to get through  
Can you, can you help me?  
'cause I'm want to love you  
  
You say hush, everyone heals in time  
So hush, hush, everyone heals in time  
Hush everyone heals in time, time  
So hush, hush, everyone heals in time  
  
Can you, can you help me?  
'cause I went away  
Can you, can you help me?  
Or is it too late?  
Can you, can you help me?  
I'm trying to get through  
Can you, can you help me?  
'cause I wanna love you  
  
I wanna love you

[Chorus]  
And even though I'm right behind you  
Shadows haunt and taunt your hand  
I cannot be your everything  
But I'll be your candy man  
  
You move a sudden grace, a child upon the Earth  
You wanted love to find you but you found it first  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We look through antiques on a fuzzy, fuzzy day  
But you always know just what you want  
Want right away  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And though you cry at night  
It's to be expected  
But know you're mine tonight  
  
So when the sun has died you dive into your mind  
But your soul is never lost until the deal is signed  
  
[Chorus]

Where does the time go  
Spinning my wheels  
Standing still  
It's like I'm running on ice  
I only gain a little distance when I fall  
How did I become a molecule  
In the concrete of this city  
Indifference to my endless motion  
In a space to small to see  
Nonetheless expected to be  
I only get a little attention when I fall  
  
[Chorus]  
And I'm falling  
Falling down  
Falling  
Falling down  
  
Cursed with reason  
In a world so defiant  
Without conclusion  
This is the story  
The story we live out  
And it is the moral too  
Look at me I'm falling for you  
  
Shaking, crying  
Hating lying to myself  
I'm tired of telling myself it's O.K.  
To be this tired  
This sick and tired of the turns the world takes  
And the people that it makes us be  
And lately it appears to me that I'm  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm falling down

I don't think you notice  
When you see my face  
I guess you're waiting  
To spin me around again  
  
Wheels I guess are turning  
Somewhere inside my head  
I know that this is  
Deeper than you get  
  
But you're coming back again  
You don't mean to waste my time  
But you're coming back so  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't tell me  
How to be  
'Cause I like some suffering  
Don't ask me  
What I need  
I'm just fine  
Here finding me  
Me  
  
I've already given  
Up on getting through  
I never question  
Who I'm talking to  
  
Oh so much for nothing  
But nothing means so much  
I know it's touching  
But I've been out of touch  
  
And it's all that I can do  
I'm a sight for my sore eyes  
But it's all I am so  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I don't think you notice  
When I can't reach out  
I guess you're waiting  
On somebody else again  
  
Oh so much for talking  
It's all been said before  
I'm hearing something  
But I wish you'd just say more  
  
But you're going off again  
When I try to just hold on  
But you're going off so  
  
[Chorus]

Take these roses off of me.  
Let me live and let me be  
For a little while.  
Let my eyes see everything and nothing in their time.  
I do not mind.  
  
Who'd have guess that I'd have learned  
To let the walls around me burn  
And light up the hillside?  
My words,  
I ate them for so long  
And nothing changed.  
It was just the same.  
  
And I don't' know if you see me here,  
But I can tell you your face is clear.  
I will see you forever, forever  
I will you see you forever, forever  
  
Pull me close once again.  
Call me teacher call me friend.  
Just like the first time.  
Call my name.  
It echoes in the walls around this room.  
It's all you.  
  
I don't know if you hear me there.  
When it's darkness and no one cares,  
I will hear you forever, forever.  
I will hear you forever, forever.  
  
I wanted you to be everything to me.  
Now I've got to learn to carry on.  
I know I cannot hide  
This emptiness inside.  
Nothing is the same since you're gone.  
  
Send me letters from above  
Send me strength. Send me love,  
Such sweet love.  
Sing me songs that echo in my head and in my heart.  
That's where you are.  
  
And I don't know if you feel me here.  
I can tell you one thing is clear.  
I will feel you forever, forever.  
I will feel you forever, forever.

Goodnight my sun  
Goodnight my friend  
Rest your soul at this  
Long day's end  
  
The fire inside  
Will warm our night  
And Daddy's arms will  
Hold you tight  
  
Dream of summer skies  
Sunset is bound to each sunrise  
Rest is your first right  
My friend goodnight  
  
This world spinning  
Time always winning  
The silver chains keep thinning and  
This is just your beginning  
  
Sleep my friend  
At last be free  
No we won't forget  
Our merriest melody  
  
Gone to another place  
Of carousel rides round an angel's face  
I'm sure we'd both laugh at the sight  
  
My friend goodnight

Keep on looking, find a way out  
Get a hold on hoping, scream and shout  
A new addiction, another show  
Truth and fiction, well I did not know  
  
[Chorus]  
I didn't know you and you didn't know me  
Broken branches and a family tree  
Blown over this wind is wide  
A lone loner's, and our great divide  
  
Running forward, warning signs  
Looking backward at the yellow lines  
All the great suggestions and the horoscope  
Stubborn lessons, and we could not cope  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And I know it's not forever  
This time it's not the same  
Why can't we live together  
And share more than a name  
  
In the name of friendship and the mask of love  
Careful not to trip on the kid gloves  
Or the cooking apron, and the wedding gown  
Fabric so thin that it ties us down  
  
[Chorus]

I know it's been a long road  
To get these towns behind me and I  
Will gladly reap what we may sow I am  
There for you and you're there for me  
  
Pictures and photographs  
Memories and windows  
Goodbyes and epitaphs  
Heartbeats and hellos  
  
[Chorus]  
Are you waiting for  
Heart in hand  
Woman and man  
See me where I stand I am  
Heart  
Heart in hand  
  
These fields may hold a hunting ground  
But the wolves are far behind me and I  
Hear the howls and the distant sound  
Of the messengers lost at sea  
  
Into the morning light  
Followed by madness  
Reach through the empty fight  
Searching through sadness  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I know it's been a long road  
To get these fears behind me and I  
Will gladly reap what we may sow I am  
There for you and you're there for me  
  
Pictures and photographs  
Memories and windows  
Goodbyes and epitaphs  
Heartbeats and hellos  
  
Are you waiting for  
Heart in hand  
Woman, man  
You see me, where I stand  
I am, heart  
Heart in hand  
  
Heart in hand  
All for a woman  
And I am, and I am waiting  
Where I stand  
I am, heart  
Heart in hand

A serenade is through, and all the fireworks, fade away  
A gathering is gone, so, no more holiday  
  
On the run (run), till we're done (done), away again  
Nothing left (left), out of breath (breath), we waste again  
It doesn't really matter, no, it doesn't anyway  
  
I held on  
To long  
I just can't break through  
I free you (oh)  
I free you  
  
Your sadder days are best, to remember, none of this  
Nobody comes around, to remind me, of what I miss  
  
Written down (down), on the ground (ground), away again  
Something wrong (wrong), now it's gone (gone), to waste again  
It doesn't really matter. no, it doesn't anyway  
  
I held on  
To long  
I just can't break through  
I free you (oh)  
I free you  
I free you (oh)  
I free you  
  
I hear it  
I hear it  
I hear it  
  
A frozen on the tracks, before the train, I hear it  
The bullet size, before the pain, I hear it  
Waiting for the flash, up in the sky, I hear it  
  
I take the fall into the light  
  
I held on  
To long  
I free you (oh)  
I free you  
I free you (oh)  
I free you

I found the pieces in my hand  
They were always there  
It just took some time for me to understand  
You gave me words I just can't say  
So if nothing else  
I'll just hold on while you drift away  
  
Cause everything you wanted me to hide  
Is everything that makes me feel alive  
  
[Chorus]  
The cities grow the rivers flow  
Where you are I'll never know  
But I'm still here  
If you were right and I was wrong  
Why are you the one who's gone  
And I'm still here  
  
I'm still here  
  
You've seen the ashes in my heart  
You smile the widest when I cry inside and my insides blow apart  
I try to wear another face  
Just to make you proud  
Just to make you put me in my place  
  
But everything you wanted from me  
Is everything that I could never be  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Maybe tonight it's gonna be alright  
I will get better  
Maybe today it's gonna be okay  
I will remember  
  
I held the pieces of my soul  
I was shattered  
And I wanted you to come and make me whole  
Then I saw you yesterday  
But you didn't notice  
You just walked away  
  
Cause everything you wanted me to hide  
Is everything that makes me feel alive  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The lights go out the bridges burn  
Once you go you can't return  
But I'm still here  
Remember how you used to say  
I'd be the one to run away  
But I'm still here  
  
I'm still here

We're all lost  
We're all found  
We're all the same  
Just one heart beats in us  
With different names  
Just one heart  
With different names  
  
Hold me inside you  
'Cause I want to be inside you  
Inside you  
  
Take this hand  
Lift me up  
Into your sky  
Hold me here  
It's just you and me  
'Cause you make me fly  
You make me fly  
  
Hold me inside you  
'Cause I want to be inside you  
Inside you  
  
We're all lost  
We're all found  
We're all the same  
  
Hold me inside you  
'Cause I want to be inside you (inside you)  
Hold me hold me hold me  
Inside you inside you  
'Cause I (hold me) want to be (hold me) (hold me)  
Inside you inside you  
  
Oh inside you  
Oh inside you

I'm here  
Wide awake again  
There's fear  
There's something I call a friend  
Hello again  
It's been a while since I saw you here  
I don't remember you saying goodbye, no  
  
It don't matter, it's over  
here I've been waiting  
All my life  
All this time  
  
It don't matter, it's over  
here I've been waiting  
All my life  
All this time  
  
Here we go  
Jump to the stars above  
So low  
Why do I fall to love  
Hello, my love  
  
This voice never called your name  
This boy will never be the same  
  
Oh, it don't matter, it's over  
here I've been waiting  
All my life  
All this time  
  
It don't matter, it's over  
here I've been waiting  
All my life  
All this time  
  
Don't let it end up this way  
Don't spend another night afraid  
Don't let it end up this way, hey  
  
It don't matter, it's over  
here I've been waiting  
All my life  
All this time  
  
It don't matter, it's over  
here I've been waiting  
All my life  
All this time  
  
I'm here  
Wide awake again

Well I saw a young man by a telephone  
He was sitting alone in the rain  
I said hey young man what you doing there  
And he said sir I'm going insane  
He said sir I'm going insane  
  
You see I love an American beauty  
But nobody here understands  
Then he looked to the sky with resentment in his eyes  
And said Lord why am I in Japan  
Oh Lord why am I in Japan  
  
Then he told me a story about yesterday  
When he walked in the search of a friend  
But nobody came to his rescue  
And he came to his bitter end  
  
He pulled me close and said they all stopped and stared  
As I walked down the street all alone  
Nobody knew my name  
Nobody knew my name  
  
I said young man I know where you're going  
And young man I know where you've been  
For I've been in this land for a lifetime it seems  
And I'm never to come back again  
No I'm never to come back again  
  
So I turned and I gave him my blessing  
And I left him alone in the rain  
But I had to just stop and laugh at myself  
Still nobody knows my name  
  
Nobody knows my name  
  
Still nobody knows my name  
Nobody knows my name  
Nobody knows my name  
My name, yeah yeah

We met as two total strangers  
As many lovers often do  
But who could have ever seen the danger  
I didn't know I'd fall in love with you  
  
[Chorus]  
You are this lonely picker's daydream  
Like a wish that's wishing to come true  
So Liberty just now I'm waiting  
To share this love song with you  
  
But do you think about me when you're lying in his bed  
Won't you take the time to explain  
Do you ever think you'd rather be with me instead  
Or do you only think about me when it rains  
  
We shared some special nights together  
We said we'd watch the morning rise  
But when the sun was all around us  
Wasn't nothing I hadn't seen in your eyes  
  
I try so hard to keep it hidden  
But I am hurting deep inside  
For every time I've seen you smile  
There are two times that I have cried  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now and forever my love will be the same  
I will be waiting underneath the pouring rain

Cut it down go put it away  
Take an inside look on the outside  
Another day  
  
Take time look at the sunshine  
Have mine it's better on you anyway  
  
Nobody's perfect all the time  
But I know you  
And you know me  
And it's alright  
  
Waking up gonna buy me some shoes  
Take a long walk out of the hindsight start anew  
  
Look around maybe buy a new topcoat  
Stop moping the rain's gonna rain through  
Rain through on you  
Yes it's true that  
  
Nobody's sunny all the time  
But I know you  
And you know me  
And it's alright  
  
And it's your life  
And it's my life  
It's our life in the city  
  
And it's your life  
And it's my life  
It's our life in the city  
  
Got a new piece out in the hills  
Plant a seed I'm in need of a break from the fire drill  
Repaint where all the paint ain't  
Got a clean slate and maybe we can buy a thrill  
I'll foot that bill  
Yes I will  
  
Nobody's busy all the time  
Oh thank God that I know you  
And you know me  
And it's alright  
  
Oh, you cut it down go put it away  
Take an inside look on the outside  
Another day  
  
Take time look at the sunshine  
Have mine it's better on you anyway  
  
Cut it down go put it away  
Take an inside look on the outside  
Another day  
  
Take time look at the sunshine  
Have mine it's better on you anyway

Well I know that no one is to blame  
But do you feel my strength when you call my name  
'Cause I feel yours inside  
How could this be more right  
  
And I have travelled through my mind  
I've given all my dreams up to time  
Tell me what else can I do  
Well I'm nothing wothout you  
  
But you, you just don't know what to do  
I guess I'll have to lose my love for you  
These feelings cannot stay  
'Cause I'm withering away  
  
I'm withering away  
Withering away  
  
And teardrops are all that I can give  
But do you really know what true love is  
Don't let it slip away  
  
This doesn't happen everyday  
  
And you'd have no problems without me  
So take this song as my apology  
But you have closed my eyes  
's light shall never rise  
rise on me  
Shall never rise  
It shall never rise  
  
And I'm scared I'll never hold you again  
But I know that no one is to blame

It's taken much too long  
To get it right  
Would it be so wrong  
To maybe find someone  
A miracle  
  
And all you really need  
Is everything you could never be  
And so you'd give it all  
For a miracle  
  
[Chorus]  
Is there a trace  
Inside her face  
Of a lonely miracle  
And so you wait  
And lie awake  
For a lonely miracle  
  
You never really know  
What it is  
Not until it goes  
And if it comes again  
It's a miracle  
  
But what you miss is love  
In everything below and up above  
And could she bring it all  
A miracle  
  
[Chorus]  
  
All you wanted was a (miracle)  
All you needed was a miracle  
A miracle  
And all you wanted was a (miracle)  
All you needed was a miracle  
A miracle  
  
It's taken so long to get it right  
Could it be so wrong  
To maybe find someone  
A miracle  
  
[Chorus]

Oh you make me lay down  
Oh you make me forget I am here  
Oh you're making me safe now  
Oh you make the faces disappear  
  
I'm all right by the way  
Everyone saves the day  
Sometimes I feel it  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Send it up  
Send it up now  
Send it up  
  
Oh I feel so close now  
Oh you're taking me back from where I've been  
Oh I'm not alone now  
Oh you rest me up and rush me in  
  
I'm all right by the way  
Everyone saves the day  
Sometimes I feel it  
  
[Chorus]

For so long my life's been sewn up tight inside your hold  
And it leaves me there without a place to call my own  
  
I know now what shadows can see  
There's no point in running 'less you run with me  
It's half the distance through the open door  
Before you cut me down  
Again  
Let me introduce you to the end  
  
And I feel the cold wind blowing beneath my wings  
It always leads me back to suffering  
But I will soar until the wind whips me down  
Leaves me beaten on unholy ground again  
  
So tired now of paying my dues  
I start out strong but then I always lose  
It's half the distance before you leave me behind  
It's such a waste of time  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause my shackles  
You won't be  
And my rapture  
You won't believe  
And deep inside you will bleed for me  
  
So here I slave inside of a broken dream  
Forever holding on to splitting seams  
So take your piece and leave me alone to die  
I don't need you to keep my faith alive  
  
I know now what trouble can be  
And why it follows me so easily  
It's half the distance through the open door  
Before you shut me down  
Again  
Let me introduce you to the end  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Though you know you care  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And my laughter  
You won't hear  
The faster  
I disappear  
And time will burn your eyes to tears

This is a song for someone all alone  
This is a song to play when they are gone  
To help you to begin again even though you've just begun  
This is a song for someone  
  
This is a song for someone wide awake  
This is a song to give a little break  
To help you slow down a bit now that the day is done  
This is a song for someone  
  
Someone who laughs  
Someone who cries  
Someone whose heart beats just like mine  
Another soul who soldiers on  
Oh, this is a song for someone  
  
This is a song for someone on the line  
This is a song to help you kill the time  
May you come home again sooner than the son  
This is a song for someone  
  
Someone who laughs  
Someone who cries  
Someone whose heart beats just like mine  
Another soul who soldiers on  
Oh, this is a song for someone  
  
I can't believe is that the full to feel when all the time is done  
I hope to see the uncertainty leave before we're gone  
  
This is a song for someone looking back  
There is something good that someone said you lack  
May it make you whole again if only while it runs  
This is a song for someone  
  
Someone who laughs  
Someone who cries  
Someone whose heart beats just like mine  
Another soul who soldiers on  
Oh, this is a song for someone  
Yeah, this is a song for someone  
  
This is a song for someone I don't know  
May your days get brighter as you go  
I guess it's never easy to love what we become  
This is a song for someone

Sometimes I can't get enough  
Ooh, of you  
This friendly game keeps getting rough  
Think I'm breaking through  
I cannot hide this well  
This well as I should  
There's always something left to tell  
Tell me is it good?  
  
I see you  
Do you see me too?  
Close your eyes and meet me in the sunshine  
Come on through  
I will find you  
Close your eyes and meet me in the sunshine  
  
I guess you chose a different road  
I am not aware  
I got the one that's been closed  
Shut down for repair  
I hold a highway in my head  
Ruling of a king  
Driving away the things I've said  
And I've said everything  
  
I see you  
Do you see me too?  
Close your eyes and meet me in the sunshine  
Come on through  
I will find you  
Close your eyes and meet me in the sunshine  
  
Meet me in the sunshine  
Meet me in the, sunshine  
  
There's something better in this heat  
Getting it on  
I feel the warmth, I feel the greed  
And I fear the fall  
I hold this window wide enough  
To keep the whole world  
I want to spit out all this stuff  
And keep the girl  
  
I see you  
Do you see me too?  
Close your eyes and meet me in the sunshine  
Come on through  
I will find you  
Close your eyes and meet me in the sunshine  
  
Meet me in the sunshine  
Meet me in the sunshine

We carried all the colors,  
From the portrait of our summer.  
We never felt the answers,  
Weighing down our shoulders.  
  
Time goes fast when you wander,  
And nothing lasts forever.  
But I still feel the power,  
Of you and me together,  
And light that surrounds you.  
  
I know I'm the lucky one,  
'Though I'm always the last to believe.  
I know I'm the lucky one,  
'Cause I'm here, and you're with me.  
  
So tell me are you willing,  
To try this thing called living.  
'Cause there's so many edges hidden,  
It's so hard to be forgiving.  
  
But I'll try once if you ask me,  
And once again everlasting.  
For all my days I'll love you,  
And all the stars you run through,  
See the light surround you...

I know I'm the lucky one,  
'Though I'm always the last to believe.  
I know I'm the lucky one,  
'Cause I'm here, and you're with me.  
  
When the wrongs and the rights all've been pushed aside,  
You're my favorite color.  
You're the black to the white and the warmth inside,  
You're the sun I'm under.  
  
I volunteer to watch you,  
Through the dreams that haunt you.  
I promise, to wake you,  
Before the fear takes you.  
  
May the light surround you  
(May the light surround you)  
May the light surround you  
  
I know I'm the lucky one,  
'Though it took so long to see.  
I know I'm the lucky one,  
'Cause I'm here, and you're with me.  
  
(May the light surround you)

Well the sun sets gently on your shoulders  
And it makes me want to touch you there  
And the light in your eyes makes me feel  
Like there's something much better out there  
Something kind  
  
And I know someday I might be looking around  
Trying to find some purpose  
Well purpose it can't be that hard to find  
As long as I've got the wind  
The wind and your love to carry me  
  
Well tomorrow holds only mystery  
And who's to say what might be  
But I know in you I've found a love so strong  
The sun and the moon look on in jealousy  
In jealousy  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well the sun sets gently on your shoulders  
And it makes me want to touch you there  
And the light in your eyes makes me feel  
Like there's something much better out there  
Something kind  
  
[Chorus]  
  
To carry me  
Please carry me

An old man lying by the road  
Black as night  
He's got his finger on the trigger  
An easy target in sight  
He's got no future, no family tree  
He's got a three dollar bottle  
And he drinks 'til he can't see  
All night, all night  
  
A young girl waiting on a line  
Eight a.m., she's got a six month old burden  
Willpower's withering thin  
An unwed mother beaten by her trade  
Each week her welfare reminds her  
Of mistakes she never made  
Oh no  
  
Now what has that to say about tomorrow  
What has that to show for today  
Noah thought to build an ark  
Before the heavens washed it all away  
Away  
  
A baby crying through a dream  
An afterthought  
Mother is seething for pleasure  
After the poison is bought  
His eyes are tainted, staggered is his breath  
Oh God, he's addicted  
Addicted to death  
Oh, no  
  
Now what has that to say about tomorrow  
What has that to show for today, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Noah thought to build an ark  
Before the heavens washed it all away  
Away, yeah  
  
Oh, now  
Now what has that to say about tomorrow  
What is that to show for today, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Noah thought to build an ark  
Before the heavens washed it all away

Take a listen through the window  
Take a lover on the radio  
Ask her if she's got an answer  
Do you know  
  
Time enough to get a good one  
Though they never seem to get done  
I am standing for a reason  
Do you know  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause I don't know how  
And I don't know where  
We are we are  
  
And I don't know why  
I don't know if  
We are we are  
  
Seven days and not a return  
Seven lives and not a thing learned  
Take a lover on the highway  
Do you know?  
  
'Cause I am sleeping on a time bomb  
And I am waiting for the light to come  
You and I could get away now  
Do you know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I get up sometimes  
Like somebody else  
Am I just wasting time  
For somebody else  
  
Take a listen through the window  
Another lover on the radio  
Ask her if she's got an answer  
Do you know?  
  
[Chorus]

Welcome home its been a while  
We've been expecting you  
You try to deny your family  
Oh, but we came through so  
Welcome,  
Welcome,  
Welcome to the bottom  
  
The waters gone, and the grain is back  
It's not exactly where you wanna be  
But we're the only true friends you've ever had  
This company loves your misery, so  
Welcome  
Welcome  
Welcome to the bottom  
  
Welcome  
Welcome  
Welcome to the bottom  
  
Welcome to the moment  
To the highlight of your life  
Welcome to the horror  
And there's no where you can hide  
Welcome to the bottom  
  
The acid burns and it takes its toll  
But we all get used to it  
There's no give and take  
Its just push and pull  
It only hurts for a bit, so  
Welcome  
Welcome  
Welcome to the bottom  
  
Welcome  
Welcome  
Welcome to the bottom  
  
Welcome to the moment  
To the highlight of your life  
Welcome to the horror  
And there's no where you can hide  
Welcome to the bottom  
  
Its so endearing how you thought you could change  
We know you'll be happy  
You just need someone to blame  
Welcome back we're back  
We're glad you know your place  
Its always there for you  
  
Welcome to the moment  
To the highlight of your life  
Welcome to the horror  
And there's no where you can hide  
Welcome to the moment  
To the highlight of your life  
Welcome to the horror  
And there's no where you can hide  
  
Welcome  
Welcome  
Welcome to the bottom

Heaven knows you're with me now  
Heaven knows that you're here  
I feel your breath all around me now  
And all the pain just disappears  
It goes away, it goes away  
  
And it only hurts, when you cry  
I'm alone inside, when there's tears in your eyes  
I can't hide and say I'm fine  
But it only hurts, when you cry  
  
You carry too much on your shoulders  
I can't wait till you let me down  
Cause the only thing we're getting is older  
This time never comes back around  
You just gave it, gave it away  
  
And it only hurts, when you cry  
I'm alone inside, when there's tears in your eyes  
I can't hide and say I'm fine  
But it only hurts, when you cry  
When you cry  
  
Heaven knows you're with me now  
And I'll do my best to hold on  
Cause nothing is worth all this fighting now  
And I won't give up till it's gone  
Make it go away, go away  
Make it go away, go away  
  
Cause it only hurts, when you cry  
I'm alone inside, when there's tears in your eyes  
I can't hide and say I'm fine  
But it only hurts, when you cry

When I was just just a young boy  
My mama said to me  
Don't fall in love willingly  
  
Now that is all forgotten  
Unwilling memory  
  
But if you change your mind  
I will walk the line  
I'll follow  
Willingly  
  
We used to talk about it  
But now it seems the wind has blown your way  
And I have come to doubt it  
That you and I will ever love again  
  
'Cause good enough is one thing  
That I will never be  
And I admit it all  
Willingly  
  
And now the times are changing  
The things I've seen before don't look the same  
My life is rearranging  
But falls apart with whispers of your name  
  
And though I swear to love you  
With all sincerity  
I'll slowly fade away  
  
Willingly  
  
The sun is on my shoulders  
Perhaps it's colder for I've lost some pride  
Or maybe it's the absence  
Of all the joy I felt right by your side  
  
And when the storm was over  
I found your memory  
And I will hold it warm  
Willingly

Dear baby, baby  
Won't you  
I go crazy, crazy  
For you  
Won't you tell me, tell me  
What to do  
I go crazy, crazy  
For you  
  
Cause the way you look at me  
I can say you set me free  
And no matter what you say  
I won't go away  
I won't go away  
  
I see your world, the world is you  
I see baby, baby blue  
Everyday is a day to get through  
Till I see baby, baby blue  
  
And the way you look at me  
I can say you set me free  
And no matter what you say  
I won't go away  
I won't go away  
  
And it takes  
Such a long time to get through this  
Such a long time to find this kiss  
And I can't forget it  
I'm not ready yet  
  
And I came such a long way  
From where you are  
Now I'm falling from this star  
And I can't forget it  
I'm not ready yet  
  
Cause the way you look at me  
I can say you set me free  
And no matter what you say  
I won't go away  
I won't go away  
  
Heal me, baby, baby won't you  
I go crazy, crazy  
For you  
Won't you tell me, tell me  
Something new  
I am crazy, crazy  
For you  
I am crazy, crazy  
For you  
I am crazy,  
Crazy for you

I've got to be honest  
I think you know  
We're covered in lies and that's OK  
There's somewhere beyond this I know  
But I hope I can find the words to say  
  
Never again no  
No never again  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause you're a god  
And I am not  
And I just thought  
That you would know  
You're a god  
And I am not  
And I just thought  
I'd let you go  
  
But I've been unable  
To put you down  
I'm still learning things I ought to know by now  
It's under the table so  
I need something more to show somehow  
  
Never again no  
No never again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I've got to be honest  
I think you know  
We're covered in lies and that's OK  
There's somewhere beyond this I know  
But I hope I can find the words to say  
Never again no  
No never again  
  
[Chorus]
