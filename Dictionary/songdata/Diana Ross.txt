I was born by the river in a little tent  
And just like the river, I've been running ever since  
It's been a long, long time coming  
But I know a change gonna come  
Oh, yes it is  
  
It's been too hard living but I'm afraid to die  
I don't know what's up there beyond the sky  
It's been a long, long time coming  
But I know a change gonna come  
Oh, yes it will  
  
Then I go to my brother, I say  
"Brother help me, please"  
But he winds up knocking me  
Back down on my knees  
  
There's been times that I thought, I wouldn't last for long  
But now I think, I'm able to carry on  
It's been a long, long time coming  
But I know a change is gonna come  
Oh, yes it will

It's been a hard day's night  
And I've been working like a dog  
It's been a hard day's night  
I should be sleeping like a log  
  
But when I get home to you  
I find the things that you do  
Will make me feel alright  
  
You know I work all day  
To get you money to buy you things  
And it's worth it just to hear you say  
You're gonna give me everything  
  
So why I love to come home?  
'Cause when I get you alone  
You know I feel okay  
  
When I'm home  
Everything seems to be right  
When I'm home  
Feeling you holding me tight, tight  
  
It's been a hard day's night  
And I've been working like a dog  
It's been a hard day's night  
I should be sleeping like a log  
  
But when I get home to you  
I find the things that you do  
Will make me feel alright  
  
So why I love to come home?  
'Cause when I get you alone  
You know I feel okay  
  
When I'm home  
Everything seems to be right  
When I'm home  
Feeling you holding me tight, tight  
  
It's been a hard day's night  
And I've been working like a dog  
It's been a hard day's night  
I should be sleeping like a log  
  
But when I get home to you  
I find the things that you do  
Will make me feel alright  
  
You know I feel alright  
You know I feel alright

Like a long lonely stream  
I keep runnin' towards a dream  
Movin' on, movin' on  
  
Like a branch on a tree  
I keep reachin' to be free  
Movin' on, movin' on  
  
'Cause there's a place in the sun  
Where there's hope for everyone  
Where my poor restless heart's gotta run  
  
Yeah, there's a place in the sun  
And before my life is done  
Gotta find me a place in the sun  
  
Like an old dusty road  
I get weary from the load  
Movin' on, movin' on  
  
Like this tired, troubled earth  
I've been rollin' since my birth  
Movin' on, movin' on  
  
There's a place in the sun  
Where there's hope for everyone  
Where my poor restless heart's gotta run  
  
I know, there's a place in the sun  
And before my life is done  
Gotta find me a place in the sun  
  
You know, when times are bad  
And you're feeling sad  
I want you to always remember  
  
Yes, there's a place in the sun  
Where there's hope for everyone  
Where my poor restless heart's gotta run  
  
Yeah, I know, there's a place in the sun  
Where there's hope for everyone  
Where my poor restless heart's gotta run  
  
Yeah, there's a place in the sun  
Where there's hope for everyone

Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby  
Ain't nothing like the real thing, honey  
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby  
Ain't nothing like the real thing  
  
I've got your picture hanging on the wall  
But it can't see or come to me  
When I call your name  
I realize it's just a picture in a frame  
  
I read your letters when you're not near  
But they don't move me  
They don't groove me like when I hear  
Your sweet voice whispering in my ear  
  
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby  
Ain't nothing like the real thing  
  
I play my games of fantasy  
I pretend but I'll know in reality  
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me  
  
No other sound is quite the same as your name  
No touch can do half as much to make me feel better  
So let's stay together  
  
I got some memories to look back on  
Though they help when you're gone, I'm well aware  
That nothing can take your place of you being there  
  
So glad we got the real thing, baby  
So glad we got the real thing, talk to me  
  
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby  
Ain't nothing like the real  
Say it loud like you're proud  
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby  
Ain't nothing like the real, baby  
  
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby  
Ain't nothing like the real, we've got it  
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby  
Ain't nothing like the real, baby  
Ain't nothing like the real thing, honey  
Ain't nothing like that real thing, baby

All for one and one for all  
You live, you give, you have a ball  
There's no need to live on an island  
'Cause everyone here respects your opinion  
It all adds up to, it's your strength we need  
So get behind and push, if you don't want to lead  
'Cause it's all for one and one for all  
You live, you give, you have a ball  
I don't know your future plans  
But divided I'm sure you will not stand  
I said, ?All that to say there's an easier way  
If it's love that we share then there's no debt to pay?  
'Cause we are all down here under the sky  
Won't you try? Won't you try?  
We're all down here  
You're not alone  
You've been pushing and pulling and shoving  
Since the day you were born so let's try  
All for one and one for all  
You live, you give, you have a ball  
And a smile will appear on your face  
'Cause suddenly, suddenly the world is a beautiful place  
'Cause it's all for one and one for all  
You live, you give, you have a ball  
All for one and one for all  
You live, you give, you have a ball  
...  

All of my life  
I have walked alone  
In search of a star  
You are that star  
You're the one I've waited for  
You're the one I've waited for  
  
All of my life  
There's a song to sing  
A chorus for two  
All that love can bring  
I'll share here with you  
You can make it all come true  
  
So darling  
All of your life to share  
Is all I'm asking  
All of the minutes and the years  
All of your happiness  
And sometimes all your tears  
  
So darling  
All of my life to share  
Is all I give you  
All of the flowers in the field  
We'll walk together through the sunsets and the years  
  
So darling  
All of my life to share  
Is all I'll give you  
And all of the flowers in the field  
We'll walk together through the sunsets and the years  
All of my life  
There's a song to sing  
A chorus for two  
All that love can bring  
I'll share here with you  
You can make it all come true

All of my life to share  
Is all I'm asking  
All of the minutes and the years  
All of your happiness  
And sometimes all your tears

All of my life to share  
Is all I give you  
All of the flowers in the field  
We'll walk together through the sunsets and the years  
  
So darling  
All of your life to share  
Is all I'm asking  

And if you see him  
Tell him I miss him  
Tell him I feel so bad  
For messing up what we had  
And if you see him  
Tell him I'm sorry  
And I regret the day  
I let him walk away  
And I want to be by his side  
And I need his love and pride  
And I need him  
And if you see him  
Tell him I'm begging  
I'll do a song and dance  
Just for a second chance  
And if you see him  
Tell him just how I look  
The circles underneath my eyes  
The make up don't seem to hide  
And I stay awake every night  
And I pray that he just might walk in  
And love me  
Walk in and love me  
I miss him more than he'll ever know  
Tell him he was  
My everything  
He was more than just a flame  
And I need him  
I miss him  
And if you see him  
Tell him my fire  
No, it's just won't burn  
Till the day that he returns  
And I want to be by his side  
And I need his love and pride  
And if you see him  
Tell him I'm begging

All day long I hear my telephone ring  
Friends calling giving their advice  
From the boy I love, I should break away  
'Cause heartaches he'll bring one day  
  
I lost him once through friends advice  
But it's not gonna happen twice  
'Cause all advice is ever gotten me  
Was many long and sleepless nights  
  
Oh, but now he's back in my arms again  
Right by my side  
I got him back in my arms again  
So satisfied  
  
It's easy for friends to say let him go  
But I'm the one who needs him so  
It's his love that makes me strong  
Without him I can't go on  
  
This time I'll life my life at ease  
Being happy lovin' whom I please  
And each time we make romance  
I'll be thankful for a second chance  
  
Oh, 'cause he's back in my arms again  
Right by my side  
I got him back in my arms again  
So satisfied  
  
How can Mary tell me what to do  
When she lost her love so true?  
And Flo, she don't know  
'Cause the boy she loves is a Romeo  
  
I listened once to my friends advice  
But it's not gonna happen twice  
'Cause all advice is ever gotten me  
Was many long and sleepless nights  
  
Oh, I got him back in my arms again  
Right by my side  
I got him back in my arms again  
So satisfied  
  
Oh, I'm satisfied, yeah, so satisfied

Every day's a new beginning  
That's what I stand for  
Since our possibilities  
In a world out of control  
  
You're looking for a miracle  
To spray the air feel the rain  
Since you're out of control  
Married to pain

There is a place we'll go  
Where there is mostly quiet  
Flowers and butterflies  
A rainbow lives beside it  
  
And from a velvet sky  
A summer storm  
You can feel the coolness in the air  
But you're still warm  
  
And then a mighty roar  
Will start the sky to cryin'  
But not even light'ning  
Will be frightening my lion  
  
And with no fear inside  
No need to run  
No need to hide  
You're standing strong and tall  
You're the bravest of them all  
  
If on courage you must call  
Then just keep on tryin'  
And tryin', and tryin'  
You're a lion  
In your own way, be a lion  
  
Come on be a lion  
  
I am standing strong and tall  
You're the bravest of them all  
If on courage you must call  
Keep on tryin'  
And tryin', and tryin'  
I'm a lion  
In my own way  
I'm a lion  
A lion  
A lion

One day, as I was walking through my garden, I saw a little frog lying on the
ground. And I thought he was sick. So I picked him up and he wasn't sick at
all. He was very sad, and he was crying. And I said: What's a matter with you,
little frog? And he looked up at me with a lump in his throat, and he said:
wribbit!  
  
It ain't easy being green  
Having to spend each day the color of the leaves  
When I think, I think it would be nicer being red  
Or yellow or gold  
  
You see, it ain't easy being green  
It seems to blend in with so many other ordinary things  
And then, sometimes, sometimes people pass over you  
Because you're not standing out like sparkles on the water  
Or like the stars in the sky  
  
But did you know that green is the color of Spring  
And green can be big like an ocean  
And important like a mountain  
And cool and friendly-like  
Or tall and skinny like a tree  
And me  
  
But when green is all there is to be  
It kind of makes you wonder why  
Why wonder, wonder why?  
Hey, I'm green and I think it'll do fine  
'Cause green is just what I wanna be  
'Cause green is beautiful, baby  
Right on green  
And anyway, money's green  
  
Wribbit

I thought I'd already touched the sky  
I got to know you and I don't know why  
But all of my life couldn't mean as much  
As just being touched by you  
  
I never thought of me growing up  
Got my directions but the road was rough  
It's only the dream of a teenage queen  
But somehow I made it through  
  
And I'd love to see  
Those faces of those friends I left behind  
And even those who spoke for me  
Just trying to be kind  
And no one said I love you just the way  
I know you do  
  
And I love being in love with you  
Living inside your heart  
The giving and the taking  
You are not forsaken  
I love being in love with you  
Thank you just for choosing me  
That we should be  
Being in love forever  
And ever, ever  
  
I stare and wonder at what I found  
I just discovered why the world is round  
Round in a circle my arms will be  
And doing the same as you  
It ain't right it's only for you and me  
Only the lonely do it separately  
Keep it alive on the food of love  
But only the chosen few  
  
In my life you see some changes in me  
We listen and we grow  
Any child that clings to childish things  
Is trying to let go  
And up to now  
I'd thought I'd seen as far as I could see  
  
And I love being in love with you  
Living inside your heart  
The giving and the taking  
You are not forsaken  
I love being in love with you  
Thank you just for choosing me  
That we should be  
Being in love forever  
And ever, ever  
  
And I love being in love with you  
Living inside your heart  
The giving and the taking  
You are not forsaken  
I love being in love with you  
Thank you just for choosing me  
That we should be

If you believe  
Within your heart  
You'll know that no one can change  
The path that you must go  
Believe what you feel  
And know you're right because  
The time will come around  
When you'll say it's yours  
  
Believe that you can go home  
Believe you can float on air  
Then click your heels three times  
If you believe  
Then you'll be there  
That's why i want you to  
Believe in yourself  
Right from the start  
Believe in the magic  
Right there in your heart  
Go ahead believe all these things  
Not because i told you to  
But believe in yourself  
If you believe in yourself  
Just believe in yourself  
As i believe in you  
  

Way back in '29, 1929, somewhere in Coffeeville  
Was a Honky tonk named Big Mable Murphy  
She had a sweetheart, mean Little Melvin  
And hell would fly between them every Saturday night  
Why? Because Little Melvin, he got wild on bathtub gin  
Well, it made him feel like he was almost twice his size  
So he'd try to take over and sass Big Mable  
But her great big fist would black little Melvin's eyes  
Ya see, Big Mable Murphy, she loved her Little Melvin  
But he never did learn to do just what she said  
'Cause poor Little Melvin, woke up early every morning  
With two black eyes and knuckle bumps on his head  
Late one rainy night, Scarface, muscle and all might  
He came in and started shoving everybody around  
Well, Big Mable Murphy, she was way back in the kitchen  
So just for fun, ol' Scarface shot Little Melvin down  
Early next morning, down by the river  
They say, old Scarface was found real short of breath  
They say, he died, uhh, oh, the man died from a good ol' whipping  
He had two black eyes and knuckle bumps on his head  
Big Mable, Big Mable Murphy  
She gave him two black eyes and knuckle bumps on his head  

Brown baby  
Brown baby  
As you grow up  
I want you to drink from the plenty cup  
I want you to stand up  
Tall and proud  
I want you to speak up  
Speak up clear and cloud  
  
Brown baby  
Brown baby  
As years roll by  
Walk with your head held high  
I want you to live by  
Live by the justice code  
I want you to walk down  
Walk down the freedom road  
  
Brown baby  
Brown baby  
Now baby  
Lie away  
Lie away sleeping  
Lie away here in my arms  
While your mommy and daddy protect you  
And keep you save from harm  
  
Brown baby  
Brown baby  
It makes me so glad  
That you will have things  
I've never had  
When out of men's hearts  
All the hate is hurled  
You're gonna live  
You're gonna live in a better world

Love is funny, or it's sad,  
Or it's quiet, or it's mad  
It's a good thing, or it's bad,  
But beautiful  
  
Beautiful to take a chance,  
And if you fall, you fall  
And I'm thinkin'  
I wouldn't mind at all  
  
Love is tearful, or it's gay,  
It's a problem, or it's play  
It's a heartache either way,  
But beautiful  
  
And I'm thinkin' if you were mine,  
I'd never let you go,  
And that would be just beautiful I know  
Beautiful to take a chance,  
And if you fall, you fall  
And I'm thinkin'  
I wouldn't mind at all  
  
Love is tearful, or it's gay,  
It's a problem, or it's play  
It's a heartache either way,  
But beautiful  
  
And I'm thinking if you were mine  
I would never let you go!  
And that would be so beautiful  
Yes, that would be but beautiful  
I know!

Lose it?  
Lose it?  
I don't even know the first thing  
About what they're feeling  
What am I afraid of?  
Don't know what I'm made of  
Can I go on  
Not knowing?  
  
Feeling?  
Feeling?  
Something tells me  
That it's more than I can deal with  
Though I never knew the song  
Some words still catch on  
Like caring and sharing  
Being together no matter  
  
Can I go on  
Not knowing?  
Don't know what I'm made of  
Why am I afraid of feeling?  
Feeling?  
If I dare to take a chance  
Would someone lead me?

Can't buy me love  
  
I'll buy you a diamond ring, my friend  
If it makes you feel alright  
I'll get you anything, my friend  
If it makes you feel alright  
  
For I don't care too much for money  
For money can't buy me love  
  
I'll give you all I got to give  
If you say you love me too  
I may not have a lot to give  
What I got, I'll give to you  
  
For I don't care too much for money  
For money can't buy me love  
Can't buy me love  
  
Everybody tells me so  
Can't buy me love  
No, no, no, no  
  
Say you don't need no diamond ring  
And I'll be satisfied  
Tell me that you want those kind of things  
That money just can't buy  
  
For I don't care too much for money  
For money can't buy me love  
Can't buy me love  
  
Everybody tells me so  
Can't buy me love  
No, no, no, no  
  
Say you don't need no diamond ring  
And I'll be satisfied  
Tell me that you want those kind of things  
That money just can't buy  
  
For I don't care too much for money  
For money can't buy me love  
  
Can't buy me love  
Can't buy me love

I know you're standing there  
Trying to say the words  
You took so long to prepare  
But I laugh, pretending I don't see  
'Cause I don't want to hear  
What you got to say to me  
  
Can't it wait until tomorrow  
Before you bring me the showers?  
Can't it wait until tomorrow?  
Give me twenty-four more hours  
  
I've seen it coming for quite sometime now  
Don't you know I've tried to stop it  
In every way I know how?  
And I know it's hard for you  
As it is for me  
So listen to my heart  
Begging desperately  
  
Can't it wait until tomorrow  
Before you bring me the showers?  
Oh, wait until tomorrow  
Give me twenty-four more hours  
  
Baby, please give me twenty-four more hours  
Can't it wait until tomorrow  
Before you bring me the showers?  
Can't it wait until tomorrow?  
Give me twenty-four more hours  
  
Can't it wait until tomorrow  
Before you bring me the showers?  
Oh, wait until tomorrow  
Give me twenty-four more hours

You're just too good to be true  
Can't keep my eyes off of you  
You feel like Heaven to touch  
And I wanna hold you so much  
  
At long last love has arrived  
And I thank God I'm alive  
You're just too good to be true  
Can't take my eyes off of you  
  
Pardon the way that I stare  
There's nothing else to compare  
The sight of you leaves me weak  
Oh, and there are no words left to speak  
  
But if you feel like I feel  
Please let me know that it's real  
You're just too good to be true  
I can't take my eyes off of you  
  
I love you, baby  
And if it's quite all right  
I need you, baby  
To warm the lonely nights  
I love you, baby  
Trust in me when I say  
  
Oh, baby, baby  
Don't bring me down, I pray  
Oh, pretty baby  
Now that I found you, stay  
And let me love you, baby  
Let me love you, baby  
Let me love you, baby  
Let me love you

Carry on  
When the valley's deep, I'll be strong  
With a mighty love to carry on  
Never sleep, new day dawns  
  
There's a new breeze blowin' tonight  
Clear away the past, honey, free at last  
Yes, I've paid for the choices I've made  
No apologies from me  
  
You know I'll never, no  
Never lose my will  
Never  
Never standin' still  
  
I'll carry on  
When the valley's deep, I'll be strong  
With a mighty love to carry on, carry on  
I'll never sleep till the new day dawns  
I carry on, I carry on  
  
I stand alone in the eye of the storm  
Pressures all around, tryin' to wear me down  
But it's all right, I won't give up the fight  
I said, "Lord, lift me up, let me rise above"  
  
I'll never  
Nobody's gonna take my pride  
I won't stop  
I will not be denied  
  
Carry on  
When the valley is deep, I'll be strong  
With a mighty love to carry on, carry on  
I'll never sleep till the new day dawns  
I carry on, carry on  
  
I won't let, I won't let nothing hold me  
(I won't let, I won't let, no no I won't let)  
(Won't let nothing hold me back)  
I won't stop now, no  
(I won't let, I won't let, no no I won't let)  
(Won't let nothing hold me back)  
Carry on  
  
I'll carry on  
(Yes, I'll carry, carry on)  
Carry on  
(Yes, I'll carry, carry on)  
Carry on

I'll never

I will not be denied  
  
Carry on  
When the valley's deep, I'll be strong  
With the mighty love to carry on, carry on  
I'll never sleep till the new day dawns  
  
When the valley's deep, just carry on  
When the mountain's too high, you gotta carry on  
With the mighty love, mighty love  
New day dawns  
  
When the valley's deep, just carry on  
When the mountain's too high, just carry on  
With the mighty love  
It's a new day dawn, carry on  
It's a new day dawn, carry on

You took a mystery and made me want it  
You got a pedestal and put me on it  
You made me love you out of feeling nothing  
Something that you do  
And I was there and not dancing with anyone  
You took a little, then you took me over  
You set your mark on stealing my heart away  
Crying, trying, anything for you  
  
I'm in the middle of a chain reaction  
You give me all the after midnight action  
I want to get you where I can let you make all that love to me  
I'm on a journey for the inspiration  
To anywhere and there ain't no salvation  
I need you to get me nearer to you  
So you can set me free  
We talk about love, love, love  
We talk about love  
We talk about love, love, love  
We talk about love  
  
You make me tremble when your hand moves lower  
You taste a little then you swallow slower  
Nature has a way of yielding treasure  
Pleasure made for you, oh  
You gotta plan, your future is on the run  
Shine a light for the whole world over  
You never find your love if you hide away  
Crying, dying, all you gotta do is  
  
Get in the middle of a chain reaction  
You get a medal when you're lost in action  
I want to get your love all ready for the sweet sensation  
Instant radiation  
You let me hold you for the first explosion  
We get a picture of our love in motion  
My arms will cover, my lips will smother you  
With no more left to say  
We talk about love, love, love  
We talk about love  
You let me hold you for the first explosion  
My arms will cover you  
  
All you gotta do is get in the middle of a chain reaction  
You get a medal when you're lost in action  
Don't pass me by  
I want to get your love all ready for the chain reaction

Well, hello there  
Good old friend of mine  
You've been reaching for yourself  
For such a long time  
There's so much to say  
No need to explain  
Just an open door for you  
To come in from the rain  
  
It's a long road  
When you're all alone  
And a man like you  
Will always take the long way home  
There's no right or wrong  
I'm not here to blame  
I just want to be the one  
Who keeps you from the rain  
From the rain  
  
And it looks like sunny skies  
Now that I know you're alright  
Time has left us older  
Wiser, I know I am  
  
'Cause I think of us  
Like an old cliche  
But it doesn't matter  
'Cause I love you anyway  
Come in from the rain  
  
And it looks like sunny skies  
Now that I know you're alright  
Time has left us older  
Wiser, I know I am  
  
And it's good to know  
My best friend has come home again  
  
'Cause I think of us  
Like an old cliche  
But it doesn't matter  
'Cause I love you anyway  
Coming from the rain  
  
Come in from the rain  
Come in from the rain

I've been crying  
'Cause I'm lonely for you  
Smiles have all turned to tears  
But tears won't wash away the fears  
  
That you're never ever gonna return  
To ease the fire that within me burns  
  
It keeps me crying baby for you  
Keeps me sighin' baby for you  
So won't you hurry?  
Come on boy, see about me  
(Come see about me)  
See about you baby  
(Come see about me)  
  
I've given up my friends just for you  
My friends are gone and you have too  
No peace shall I find  
Until you come back and be mine  
  
No matter what you do or say  
I'm gonna love you anyway  
  
Keep on cryin', baby for you  
I'm gonna keep sighin' baby for you  
So come on hurry?  
Come on and see about me  
(Come see about me)  
See about you baby  
(Come see about me)  
  
Sometime's up, sometime's down  
My life's so uncertain and with you not around  
From my arms you maybe out of reach  
But my heart says you're here to keep  
  
Keeps me crying baby for you  
Keep on, keep on crying baby for you  
So, won't you hurry?  
Come on boy, see about me  
(Come see about me)  
See about you baby  
(Come see about me)  
  
You know I'm so lonely  
(Come see about me)  
I love you only  
(Come see about me)  
See about you baby  
(Come see about me)  
Hurry, hurry

This thing called love I just can't handle it  
This thing called love I must get round to it  
I ain't ready  
Crazy little thing called love  
This (This Thing) called love  
(Called Love)  
It cries (Like a baby)  
In a cradle all night  
It swings (Woo Woo)  
It jives (Woo Woo)  
It shakes all over like a jelly fish,  
I kinda like it  
Crazy little thing called love  
  
There goes my baby  
She knows how to Rock n' roll  
She drives me crazy  
She gives me hot and cold fever  
Then she leaves me in a cool cool sweat  
  
I gotta be cool relax, get hip  
  
Get on my track's  
Take a back seat, hitch-hike  
And take a long ride on my motor bike  
Until I'm ready  
Crazy little thing called love  
  
I gotta be cool relax, get hip  
Get on my track's  
Take a back seat, hitch-hike  
And take a long ride on my motor bike  
Until I'm ready (Ready Freddie)  
Crazy little thing called love  
  
This thing called love I just can't handle it  
This thing called love I must get round to it  
I ain't ready  
Crazy little thing called love

I must be crazy they don't know what we've done  
You are my lover  
Even though I know it's wrong  
I hear them talking  
But whatever they do  
I need to love you  
And if I love you couldn't we make it  
  
Got someone loving me  
He won't say goodbye  
He's been so good to me  
I don't want to make him cry  
I need you both to love me  
It's up to you  
You can help me  
You're the reason I can't decide  
  
Breakin' my bones and shakin' my nerves  
Till I just can't see tomorrow  
Looking at him and looking at you  
And I don't know who to follow  
I'll never win in the state I'm in  
  
It's a crime of passion, I'm bad to love you  
Whenever I'm with you, I lose control  
It's a crime of passion for me and for you  
Whatever I give you  
It's just too late to save my soul  
I need to love you  
My desperation is the power to go on  
Each night I prayed for love  
I'm at the mercy of  
And if you don't hear me now  
Then I'll be the only one  
Don't want to be, don't want to be the only one  
  
I saw him yesterday  
The questions he asked  
I think he knows about us  
Did we move too fast  
How can we hide it  
When we know it's a lie  
Keep our love under the covers  
The pressure is too high  
  
Why do I get myself tied up  
Why tangle with love you borrow  
I should have been known as a one man woman  
Should have been one love but oh no  
Never be a cure for the human law  
  
It's a crime of passion, I'm bad to love you  
Whenever I'm with you, I lose control  
It's a crime of passion for me and for you  
Whatever I give you  
It's just too late to save my soul  
I need to love you  
My desperation is the power to go on  
Each night I prayed for love  
I'm at the mercy of  
And if you don't hear me now  
Then I'll be the only one  
Don't want to be, don't want to be the only one

You're like a child within  
The one who just won't give in  
Oh how you love to play  
I wanna understand  
I wanna do all I can  
I wanna make you stay  
  
Where will I find you  
Next time I lose you  
I'm just a fool for your touch  
  
Cross my heart  
I wanna love you  
How can I love you  
If you keep running away  
Cross my heart  
It's getting stronger  
I can't wait much longer  
You gotta stop running away  
  
Your kisses are bittersweet  
Alibis incomplete  
I know what you didn't say  
Now haven't you had your fun  
Is anything left undone  
Why can't we meet half way  
  
When will you find out  
Now that the truth's out  
This is more than a careless romance  
  
Cross my heart  
I wanna love you  
How can I love  
If you keep running away  
Cross my heart  
It's getting stronger  
I can't wait much longer  
You gotta stop running away  
  
True love is never quite enough  
It's so unsure  
Is it what you're dreaming of  
Darling, it's time you let me in  
Maybe tonight  
We can start again  
  
Cross my heart  
I wanna love you  
How can I love you  
If you keep running away  
Cross my heart  
It's getting stronger  
I can't wait much longer  
You gotta stop running away  
  
Cross my heart  
It's getting stronger  
I can't wait much longer  
You gotta stop running away  
Cross my heart  
It's getting stronger  
I can't wait much longer  
You gotta stop running away

How do you live with a broken heart?  
Everytime you come too close  
I just run away  
I need you so much  
And that's so hard to say  
There is me and there is you  
And I get confused  
And sooner or later  
I know that I'll have to choose  
  
You know it's true  
I'm crying my heart out for you  
What can I do  
I'm losing myself over you  
Over and over again  
I'm crying my heart out for you  
No one in love likes to lose  
How do you live with a broken heart  
  
And I can honestly say  
I want to be on my own  
That too bare existence  
When I was all alone  
I know you're not asking me  
To just live for you  
But it's always how I've loved  
And all I know how to do  
  
You know it's true  
I'm crying my heart out for you  
What can I do  
I'm losing myself over you  
Over and over again  
I'm crying my heart out for you  
No-one in love likes to lose  
  
But how do you live with a broken heart?  
Once again I'm falling in love  
Like a fool I'm falling in love  
And I don't know what I'm doing  
  
Once again it's somebody else  
That I need, I'm losing myself  
And I'm scared of what I'm feeling  
  
It's true  
I'm crying my heart out for you  
What can I do  
I'm losing myself over you  
Over and over again  
I'm crying my heart out for you  
No one in love likes to lose  
  
Once again I'm falling in love  
Like a fool I'm falling in love  
And I don't know what I'm doing, doing  
  
Once again it's somebody else  
That I need, I'm losing myself  
And I'm scared of what I'm feeling  
  
About you  
I'm crying my heart out for you  
What can I do  
I'm losing myself over you  
Over and over again  
I'm crying my heart out for you  
What can I do  
I'm losing myself over you  
Over and over again

Don't leave me, don't leave me here  
On the dark side of the world  
  
My days are darker than your nights  
Since I lost you, babe  
Since I lost you, babe  
  
I'm like an ember  
Fading out of sight  
One more tear, and I know I'll disappear  
Bring back the sunshine  
That you took away  
  
'Cause I need ya  
And I want ya  
Just don't think I'm gonna make it without your love  
  
Don't you know  
Such a loneliness I've never known  
Since I lost you, babe  
Since I lost you, babe  
I'm like a woman who once knew splendor  
Now all her wealth and riches  
They are gone  
  
Bring back the sunshine  
That you took away  
'Cause I need ya  
And I want ya  
And I just don't think I'm gonna make it without your love  
  
Bring back the sunshine that you took away  
Now my future lies in back of me  
Since I lost you, babe  
Since I lost you, babe  
I walk this lonely road to eternity  
Just despair and emptiness everywhere  
  
Bring back the sunshine  
That you took away  
'Cause I need ya  
And I want ya  
I just don't think I'm gonna make it without your love  
  
Don't leave me, don't leave me here  
On the dark side of the world  
  
Oh, don't you leave me here  
On the dark side of the world  
'Cause I need ya  
Oh, you know I want ya  
Right here on the dark side of the world

Did you read the morning paper  
Did you see the front headline  
Did you read the morning paper  
Baby let me lend you mine  
  
There on the front page was a picture  
Of a crowd as they watched a parade passing by  
And through the haze of last nights sleep  
Something familiar caught my eye  
  
There was a couple looking so much in love, yes  
They had a front line view  
And as I pulled the paper closer  
I realized standing next to her it was you  
  
Did you read the morning paper  
Did you see the front headline  
Did you read the morning paper  
Baby let me lend you mine  
  
Now I know why you've been working late each night  
And no longer have desire to ever hold me tight  
And your busy, busy schedule was all a lie  
Oh, even the dream with a bonus, oh just another alibi  
  
Did you read the morning paper  
Did you see the front headline  
Did you read the morning paper  
Baby let me lend you mine  
  
Did you get the news today  
Did you read the morning paper  
Isn't the picture very clear  
Where do we go from here  
  
Did you read the morning paper  
Did you see the front headlines  
Did you read the morning paper  
Baby let me lend you mine  
  
Oh, what now  
Did you read the morning paper  
Did you get the news today

Don't explain  
  
Quiet don't explain

Don't tell me not to fly  
I've simply got to  
If someone takes a spill  
It's me and not you  
  
Don't bring around the cloud to rain on my parade  
Don't tell me not to leave  
Just sit and putter  
Life's candy and the sun's a ball of butter  
  
Who told you you're allowed to rain on my parade  
I'll march my band out  
I'll beat my drum  
And if I'm fanned out  
  
Your turn at bat, sir  
At least I didn't fake it, hat, sir  
I guess I didn't make it  
But whether I'm the rose of sheer perfection  
  
A freckle on the nose of life's complexion  
A Cinderella or a shine apple of an eye  
I gotta fly once  
I gotta try once  
  
Only can die once, right, sir?  
Ooh, life is juicy  
Juicy and you see  
I gotta have my bite, sir  
  
Get ready for me love  
'Cause I'm a "comer"  
I simply gotta march  
My heart's a drummer  
  
Don't bring around the cloud to rain on my parade  
Yes, sir  
No, sir  
I'm gonna live and live now  
  
Get what I want, I know how  
All that the law will allow  
One roll for the whole shebang  
One throw that bell will go clang  
Though I'm alone I'm a gang  
Eye on the target and wham  
One shot, one gun shot and bam  
Hey, world, here I am...  
Get ready for me life, 'cause I'm a "comer"  
I simply gotta march, my heart's a drummer  
Nobody, no, nobody, is gonna rain on my parade!

Living for you is easy living  
It's easy to live when you're in love  
And I'm so in love  
There's nothing in life but you  
  
I never regret the years that I'm giving  
They're easy to give when you're in love  
I'm happy to do, whatever I do for you  
  
For you, maybe I'm a fool, but it's fun  
People will say you rule me with one wave of your hand  
Darling, it's grand, they just don't understand  
  
Living for you is easy living  
It's easy to live when you're in love  
And I'm so in love  
There's nothing in life but you

Every day is a new day  
Since you went away  
(Since you went away)  
Since you went away from me  
My whole life has made a change  
(Made a change)  
Every day's a new day and I see  
It was best for you and me  
Since you went away from me  
My whole life has made a change  
Every day's a new day  
(Every day's a new day)  
Since you went away from me  
(Since you went away)  
You were my comfort zone  
I depended on you for everything  
I wanted in my life, yes I did  
But now that you're gone  
I'm doing just fine without you  
How I bless the day you went away  
Now I have a song inside  
(Inside)  
The birds sing to me  
I finally can be  
Free to spread my wings in harmony  
Now the sun shines on me  
(On me)  
I have been set free  
To collect my thoughts and jot them down  
All this happiness I've found  
Since you've been away  
Since you went away from me  
My whole life has made a change  
(Made a change)  
Every day's a new day and I see

Since you went away from me  
(Yeah)  
My whole life has made a change  
Every day's a new day  
Since you went away from me  
(Since you went away)  
It may sound crazy, but I forgive you  
And want the best for you  
The circumstances came my way  
Now I've learned to do for myself  
And all the things I thought  
That you would do for me  
Like leaving me alone to go for my own  
When you're not at home, I'm glad you're gone  
Now I have a song inside  
(Inside)  
The birds sing to me  
I finally can be  
Free to spread my wings in harmony  
Now the sun shines on me  
(On me)  
I have been set free  
To collect my thoughts and jot them down  
All this happiness I've found

My whole life has made a change

Since you went away from me  
(From me)  
My whole life has made a change  
Every day's a new day and I see  
It was best for you and me  
(How I bless that day)  
Since you went away from me  
My whole life has made a change  
Every day's a new day  
Since you went away from me

Love of my life

And everything is right  
And everything is groovy  
The boy moves me  
Sets my soul on fire  
  
Sweet love of mine  
Sweet love of mine  
Sweet love of mine  
  
And everything is fine  
And everything is groovy  
The boy moves me  
Keeps me satisfied

You've given me is still in me  
It's one thing i couldn't sacrifice  
You're my joy, you're my pleasure  
But most of all darling  
You're my treasure  
  
Everything is everything  
Everything is everything

See me loving you  
A fool without a lover  
How can that possibly be  
Maybe you can show me why  
I shiver when you're closer  
I remember your touch without it  
Let me drown in your ecstasy  
It's got to be do or die  
  
Don't tell me love is just one night  
I know it's not true  
There should be someone there to catch you  
When the rain falls  
And you can turn away my heaven  
And maybe I was wrong  
I depended on the inner voice of  
  
Experience, or just imagination  
Whatever you believe in, you can lose  
And one way or the other, we can find  
Another world we can run away to  
I'm living for the  
Experience, is only what you make it  
You live forever but you never know  
That somebody loves you  
And when the sky is open  
Fly away lovers can share  
I'll be there  
  
And you can make the earth move  
You can take me with no struggle  
Lead me through your mystical dreams  
Show me what you are  
And we can make the wind blow  
You're the power and I'm in it  
You can be the fire I start  
I want your heart  
  
And let there be a story when the stories are told  
I need to hear you say you love me when the night falls  
We may never go to heaven but one thing that is sure  
You can not ignore  
I'll make it more than  
  
Experience is not imagination  
You get what you believe in if you choose  
Somebody loves you  
I couldn't get no higher  
Fly away lovers can share  
And we'll be there  
  
Experience is not imagination  
You get what you believe in if you choose  
And one way or the other  
We can find another world we can run away to  
And I love you  
Experience is only what you make it  
You come together when you let yourself go  
And somebody loves you  
I couldn't get no higher  
Fly away lovers can share  
And we'll be there  
  
(Repeat last verse and fade)

"Is it a beautiful day? You're beautiful!  
I mentioned earlier that the world is watching each of you.  
You make me so proud I'm the happiest woman in the world right now.  
I have a dream come true."  
"I want you to listen to me now.  
This is being televised again worldwide today.  
Just calm yourselves, come on. Alright.  
Can you feel me?  
Yes, this may be the most important moment in my life.  
There are words in this song that to me are very special Listen."  
It's more than you  
It's more than me  
No matter what we are  
We are a family  
This dream is for us  
This one can be real  
They can't stop us now  
Because of how we feel  
It's more than you  
It's more than me  
whatever dreams we have  
They're for the family  
We're not alone any more then  
There are others there  
And this dream's big enough  
For all of us to share  
So don't think you're going  
We're not going anywhere  
We're staying, taking our share  
If you get afraid again  
I'll be there  
We are a family  
Like a giant tree  
Branching out towaards the sky  
We are a family  
And so much more  
Than just you and I  
We are a family  
Like a giant tree  
Growing strong  
Growing wiser  
We are  
We are  
a family  
"I love you"

Money isn't everything, ask anyone who's rich  
It can buy pain and misery or grief  
Though money isn't everything  
I have a pauper's itch, so though I crave a brave  
Yes, I'll take the chief!  
  
He bought me a cat, Siamese, imagine that  
He keeps making, fancy passes at me  
All those fine and fancy passes  
  
Oh joy, now I've got sixty feet of brand new yacht  
He keeps making fancy passes at me  
All those fine and fancy passes  
  
He owns New York or Spain but I don't know which  
He got fat in Uptown Manhattan  
Poor Cinderella's got her a fella who's rich  
Every penny, he's worth a plenty  
  
He owns United Airlines, that as well?  
He owns receding hairlines, oh, well  
He's not so hip or smart as a whip  
But healthy, wise and wealthy  
  
He bought me a summer place  
Somewhere out in outer space  
He keeps making fancy passes at me  
  
What a man you've got, Diane  
Did he buy you a mink? Passion pink  
And a Cadi too? Baby blue  
You're speaking of? My baby love  
Your Romeo? My Daddy Dough  
I love him a lot, how much has he got?  
  
He's got a plot of ground, he found over oil  
Oh, my how chic we are  
He bought New Jersey  
So he could call me his girl  
Oh, man, a feat we are  
  
Chocolate excites my tummy  
He bought me a firm called Yummy  
So, he's one of those gents  
With good bizness cents  
And quarters, half's and dollars  
  
Ding, dong, ain't it swell  
They just delivered the liberty bell  
How sad all those Philadelphians will be  
  
I'll get half of what he owns  
To keep up with Mrs. L. B. Jones  
And if he keeps making fancy passes  
I'll start holding evening classes  
  
I'll give him sugar and molasses  
And the life, I live, I'll live luxuriously  
From those late and evening classes  
That sugar and molasses  
Those fine and fancy passes at me  
My honey, yeah

My man don't love me  
He treats me so mean  
My man don't love me  
He treats me so mean  
Well he's the, lowest man  
That I've ever seen  
  
He wears high trimmed pan  
Stripes are really yellow  
Well he wears high trimmed pan  
Stripes are really yellow  
But when he starts to love me  
He's so fine and mellow  
  
Love will make you gamble  
And stay out all night long  
Love will make you gamble  
And stay out all night long  
Love will make you do things  
You always thought was wrong  
  
But if you treat me right baby  
I'll stay home everyday  
Said if you treat me right baby  
I'll stay home everyday  
But you're so darned mean  
I just know you're gonna drive me away  
  
But if you treat me right baby  
I'll stay home everyday  
Said if you treat me right baby  
I'll stay home everyday  
But you're so darned mean  
I just know you're gonna drive me away  
  
Love is like a faucet  
It turns off and on  
Love is like a faucet  
It turns off and on  
Sometimes when you think it's on baby  
It's turned off and gone

What do you want, baby  
One last piece of my heart  
What do you need, baby  
We could make a new start  
  
I'm not scared  
All the nights alone  
Lying there crying with the television on  
Watching those scoops about love and happiness  
Wonder what I ever did to deserve a fate like  
  
I don't wanna be around  
For that famous final scene  
I just can't help myself  
I'm a fool for your love  
  
Leave me alone, please  
My heart can't take any more  
You left me going crazy  
It started like just like a phone  
  
You're the number one  
You're the only one I need  
If you don't want my love  
Then set me free  
  
I don't wanna be around  
For that famous final scene  
I can't help myself  
I'm a fool for your love  
  
Don't come closer  
You know I'm easy to phone  
You don't love me  
Any fool can see  
I'm telling you goodbye  
Bye, bye  
  
Leave me alone, please  
My heart can't take anymore  
Leave me alone, please  
Let me walk out that door  
Leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone  
  
I don't wanna be around  
For that famous final scene  
I just can't help myself  
I'm a fool for your love  
  
I'm a fool for your love  
I'm a fool for your love  
Leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone  
A fool for your love  
I'm a fool for your love  
Leave me alone, please  
My heart can't take it no more  
Leave me alone, leave me alone

There you were standing there  
As your eyes reached out to me  
Something warm in your eyes  
Touched my heart right then and there  
All the love I never knew  
I found in you  
  
Suddenly, my world stood still  
My life was then fulfilled  
As you gently touched my hand  
I knew that we had laid a plan  
For everlasting love  
That I been forever dreaming of  
  
At last, ooh, at last  
My forever came today  
When you walked into my life  
And made my lonely life a paradise  
It came today  
Forever came today  
  
Forever came today

As we were standing there  
You didn't speak a single word  
But your eyes  
Your eyes said you wanted me  
Your touch said you needed me  
And my heart said tenderly  
  
Darling, ooh, my darling  
Make me yours  
Let your kiss touch my face  
And tell me love has lead me  
To this place to your warm embrace  
And our happiness  
  
Thanks to you

And I want the world to see  
How gently love has shined on me  
With everlasting love  
That I been forever dreaming of

Chill in the bones, chill in the air  
Do you think that I haven't been around?  
Boy I wasn't born yesterday, yesterday  
Coming home late at night, flowers on the doorstep  
Trying to make it right  
Boy you gotta be high's what I got to say  
I got to say, I've done all I can  
I've given you every chance to prove you are my man  
But now there's nothing left to lose  
  
I'm free, like the wind  
Independent once again  
Yeah, I'm gone, I gotta be moving on  
Free, watch me fly  
Lift your hands and wave bye bye  
'cause I'm gone  
I gotta be movin' on, movin' movin' movin' on  
Movin' movin' movin' on, movin' movin' movin' on  
  
I think i'll go do the mall, make a couple of calls  
Gonna hang with the girls  
Just to keep from crying on a shoulder  
Ain't gonna turn back  
Nothing you can say can change that feeling that you get  
When you know that it's finally, finally over  
I've made up my mind  
Even though it hurts to leave your love behind  
I've got nothing left to lose  
  
I'm free, like the wind  
Independent once again  
Yeah, I'm gone, I gotta be moving on  
Free, watch me fly  
Lift your hands and wave bye bye  
'cause I'm gone  
I gotta be movin' on, movin' movin' movin' on  
Movin' movin' movin' on, movin' movin' movin' on  
  
I'm gone  
Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do  
Even if your heart is trying to tell you to  
Stay a little bit longer, trell you to  
Try a little bit harder, baby I know  
I can't live another day, sleep another night  
Waiting for you to change into something I  
Wish you could have been  
It's not what I'm into now  
  
I've done all I can  
Given you every chance to prove  
You are my man  
But now there's nothing left to lose  
  
I'm free, like the wind  
Independent once again  
Yeah, I'm gone, I gotta be moving on  
Free, watch me fly  
Lift your hands and wave bye bye  
'cause I'm gone  
  
I gotta be moving on  
Free from your spell  
Taking care of me myself  
Yeah, I'm gone  
I gotta be moving on  
  
I'm free, like the wind  
Independent once again  
I'm gone, moving on  
Free, watch me fly  
Lift your hands and wave bye bye  
Moving on  
Free from your spell  
Taking care of me myself  
  
Moving on, I'm gone  
Free from your spell, independent  
I'm gone

When I gave all of my love to you  
I said you were a dream come true  
  
Good to you,  
So good to you  
Is what I'm gonna be  
And I hope you fall in love with me  
  
Persevere is what we'll do  
What we'll do to make  
Our love everlasting  
  
Oh, friend I owe all of my life to you  
I said you were a dream come true  
I don't want  
No, I don't want to be so cold to you  
It's just a defense that I sometimes use  
  
I have often thought that I  
Had no love to give  
But it's yours for the asking  
Ooh  
  
I have often thought  
I had no love to give  
It's yours  
Yours for the asking  
  
Oh friend  
I give my life to you  
I say you are a dream come true  
Oh friend,  
Oh friend  
I give my life to you  
I say you are  
You are a dream come true  
  
Friend to friend

I sit by the telephone  
Waiting for you to call me  
And when I'm alone in the night  
The blues start to fall on me  
Baby, I'm waiting for you  
And all that's on my mind  
Is what I'm gonna do  
  
My friends say I'm crazy  
And I'm wasting my time on you  
I'm breaking the rules  
And I'm way out of line it's true  
Baby, one night with you  
And they'd be goin' crazy too  
  
I'm getting ready for love  
Brand new start  
Here's my heart  
I'm getting ready for love  
I can feel  
This time it's real  
  
All I keep thinkin' about  
Is the way that you do to me  
Baby, the wonder of you  
Has made the wonderful come true  
  
I'm getting ready for love  
Brand new start  
Here's my heart  
I'm getting ready for love  
I can feel  
This time it's real  
  
I'm under your spell  
Of that I'm sure  
You can tell  
  
Sailin' along on a breeze  
Ooh, I'm flying  
Ooh, I'm skying  
  
I'm getting ready for love  
Brand new start  
Here's my heart  
I'm getting ready for love  
I can feel  
This time it's real  
  
I'm getting ready for love  
Yes, I am  
Yes, I am  
I'm getting ready for love

Up in Harlem every Saturday night  
Were the highbrows get together, just to write  
They all congregate at an all night hack  
What they do is ooh papa dah  
  
Ol' Hannah Brown, way cross town  
Gets full of corn and starts bringing 'em down  
And at the break of day  
You can hear ol' Hannah say  
  
Gimme a pigfoot and a bottle of beer  
Send me daddy, move right down  
I feel just like I wanna clown  
Give the piano player a drink  
Because he's bringing me down  
  
He's got rhythm, when he stomps his feet  
He moves me right off to sleep  
Check all your razors and your guns  
We're gonna be arrested when the wagon comes  
  
Gimme a pigfoot and a bottle of beer  
Send me 'cause I don't care  
  
I want a pigfoot and a bottle of gin  
Send me daddy, move right in  
Feel just like I wanna shop  
Give the piano player a drink  
Because he's knocking me out  
  
He's got rhythm when he stomps his feet  
He moves me right off to sleep  
Check all your razors and your guns  
We're gonna do the huckabuck until the rising sun  
  
Gimme a pigfoot and a bottle of gin  
Move me 'cause I don't care  
I want a pigfoot and a bottle of beer

Girls, they are so lovely  
Oh girls, girls, oh, please love me  
Girls run around in your head  
'Til you wish you had boys instead  
Girls, they are such fragile stuff  
That you just can't get enough  
Oh girls, girls  
They are impossible  
Girls, girls, girls, girls, girls  
Do I have girls?  
Let me tell you about some girls  
I have three girls  
Rhonda, Tracee and Chudney  
I have girls in my bathroom  
Girls in my closet  
Girls wearing my shoes  
My lipstick, my perfume  
Sleeping with my husband  
What was that?  
They say your life changes  
When you have kids  
Bring it way down, Gill  
You know your life doesn't change, it ends  

Come over here and rest awhile  
Look at the trip you've made  
I know you must be tired by now  
So rest here in the shade  
  
Oh, the journey that you've had to make  
I've watched you bear the load  
But you can always stay at my place  
When you come off the road  
  
And if you ever need someone (need someone)  
Count on me anytime (you can count on me)  
I'll be here to pick you up  
Because a rested body is a rested mind  
Because a rested body is a rested mind  
(Because a rested body is a rested mind)  
A rested body is a rested mind  

Go, tell it on the mountain  
Over the hills and everywhere  
Go, tell it on the mountain  
Our jesus christ is born  
When I was just a learner  
I sought by night and day  
To have the good lord help me  
To guide me on my way  
For I am like a shepherd  
My hopes and faith to guard  
Each day I find the answer  
And love is my reward  
Go, tell it on the mountain  
Over the hills and everywhere  
Go, tell it on the mountain  
Our jesus christ is born  
The shepherds kept their watching  
O'er silent flocks by night  
When lo! throughout the heavens  
There shone a holy light  
The shepherds feared and trembled  
When high above the earth  
Rang out an angels' chorus  
To hail our savior's birth  
Go, tell it on the mountain  
Over the hills and everywhere  
Go, tell it on the mountain  
Our jesus christ is born  
Go, tell it on the mountain  
Over the hills and everywhere  
Go, tell it on the mountain  
Our jesus christ is born  
Our jesus, jesus christ is born  
That jesus christ is born  
Go and tell, tell it on the mountain  
That jesus christ, christ is born  

Them that's God shall get  
Them that's not shall lose  
So the Bible says  
And it still is news  
  
Momma may have  
Poppa may have  
But God bless the child  
That's got his own  
That's got his own  
  
Yeah, the strong gets more  
While the weak ones fade  
Empty pockets don't  
Ever make the grade  
  
Momma may have  
Poppa may have  
But God bless the child  
That's got his own  
That's got his own  
  
Money, you've got lots of friends  
Crowdin' round the door  
When its gone and  
Spendin' ends  
They don't come no more  
  
Rich relations give  
A crust of bread and such  
You can help yourself  
But don't take too much  
  
Momma may have  
Poppa may have  
But God bless the child  
That's got his own  
That's got his own

Save me, save me, save me  
Save me, save me, save me  
  
I'm going down, down for the third time  
I'm going down, down for the third time  
Drowning in tears from my heart that's hurting  
Drowning in tears from a love that's uncertain  
  
I'm lost in a world without love, a sea of emptiness  
The love we knew is being washed away  
Don't think I can last, my heart is sinking fast  
  
I'm going down, down for the third time  
Trying to hold on to a love that's mine  
Drowning in the love that keeps me grieving  
Drowning in the fear that my arms you're leaving  
  
Bring back that love we knew  
Darling let me live again  
A little tenderness to me start showing  
Fill my heart with love till it's overflowing  
  
I'm going down, down for the third time  
Trying to hold on to a love that's gone  
I'm going down, down for the third time  
So won't you save this heart of mine  
  
Going down, down for the third time  
Going down, down for the third time  
I'm like a ship all alone on a raging sea  
You got me tossing and a turning  
And I can't get free  
  
Reach out your hand for me  
Darling, save what's left of our love  
I'll forgive your lies and alibi's  
If you'll wipe my crying eyes  
  
I'm going down, down for the third time  
So won't you save this heart of mine  
I've loved too long, I love too strong  
Now little boy you know you're doing me wrong  
  
Come on and save me  
Come on and save me  
Come on and save me  
I'm going down, down for the third time

You've been in love once before  
But never quite like this, no  
And you fall in love more and more  
With every single kiss, yeah  
So tell me why do you do the things  
That you continue to do  
When I'm not the one who hurt you so  
I wouldn't cheat on you  
It can't keep goin' on  
Like the feelin' doesn't exist  
Or the one you love  
Will be the one you miss  
Then you'll dream about love and how it would be  
But then you'll wake up to reality to find I'm gone, I'm gone  
Then you'll start to think and reminisce  
'Cause it's my hugs and kisses you'll miss  
But I'm gone, I'm gone  
You go through life searchin' for love  
And you're lucky if you find, yeah  
Someone who cares about you so  
And will never mislead you, no  
But If you hide the way you feel  
Why do you carry on?  
'Cause I won't stay around  
To wait on you to make up your mind, yeah  
It can't keep goin' on  
Like the feelin' doesn't exist  
Or the one you love  
Will be the one you miss  
Then you'll dream about love and how it would be  
But then you'll wake up to reality to find I'm gone, I'm gone  
Then you'll start to think and reminisce  
'Cause it's my hugs and kisses you'll miss  
But I'm gone, I'm gone  
It can't keep goin' on  
Like the feelin' doesn't exist  
Or the one you love  
Will be the one you miss  
Then you'll dream about love and how it would be  
But then you'll wake up to reality to find I'm gone, I'm gone  
Then you'll start to think and reminisce  
'Cause it's my hugs and kisses you'll miss  
But I'm gone, I'm gone  
Then you'll dream about love and how it would be  
But then you'll wake up to reality to find I'm gone, I'm gone  
Then you'll start to think and reminisce  
'Cause it's my hugs and kisses you'll miss  
I'm gone, I'm gone  
You'll dream about love and wake up  
To find I'm gone, I'm gone  
You'll start to think and reminisce  
That I'm gone, I'm gone  

Good morning heartache  
You old gloomy sight  
Good morning heartache  
Thought we said goodbye last night  
  
I tossed and turned  
Until it seemed you had gone  
But here you are with the dawn  
Wish I'd forget you  
  
But you're here to stay  
It seems I met you  
When my love went away  
Now every day I start by  
  
Saying to you  
Good morning heartache, what's new?  
Stop haunting me now  
Can't shake you no how  
  
Just leave me alone  
I've got those Monday blues  
Straight through Sunday blues  
Good morning heartache  
  
Here we go again  
Good morning heartache  
You're the one who knew me well  
Might as well get used to you  
  
Hangin' around  
Good morning heartache  
Sit down

I've got to be free  
Gotta be, gotta be free  
I've got to be free  
Gotta be, gotta be free  
  
Long goodbyes, stolen glances  
Can't explain all that's happened in our past  
I'm tired of creating lies to be alone  
I'm living wrong, we're living wrong  
  
More and more you make me  
Afraid to come around  
You take the pleasure out of being in love  
And being down and down and down and down and down  
For the one who's there for me  
All I really want to be is free, yeah  
  
I've got to be free, got to be free  
Gotta be, gotta be free  
I've got to be free, got to be free  
Gotta be, gotta be free  
  
You don't know why, haven't got a clue  
In the dark about why I am leaving you  
You can't expect me to go on this way  
No, I cannot stay, I will not stay  
  
More and more you make me  
Realize what I have home  
What's taboos exciting  
But sometimes it just gets old  
Sometimes it just gets old  
For as long as I am me, boy  
All I really want to be is free  
  
I've got to be free, got to be free  
Gotta be, gotta be free  
I've got to be free, got to be free  
Gotta be, gotta be free  
  
I've got to be free, got to be free  
Gotta be, gotta be free  
I've got to be free, got to be free  
Gotta be, gotta be free  
  
I've got to be free, got to be free  
Gotta be, gotta be free  
I've got to be free, got to be free  
Gotta be, gotta be free

I might have known a lot of things  
Been smiled upon by kings and queens  
Had you been around  
  
Perhaps had you been by my side  
My dreams might not have been denied  
Had you been around  
  
I've wasted many years, tasted many tears  
And I want to know  
Lost on my own before I knew of you  
  
I might have heard a sigh  
Of someone passing by  
Had you been around  
  
And though it seems absurd  
I really never heard  
A sound  
  
Until that day you came my way  
With pleasure I never found  
It all might have been  
Had you been around  
  
Had you been around  
Perhaps had you been by my side  
My dreams might not have been denied  
Had you been around  
  
I've wasted many years, tasted many tears  
And I want to know  
I'm lost on my own before I knew of you  
  
I might have heard a sigh  
Of someone passing by  
Had you been around  
  
And though it seems absurd  
I really never heard  
A sound  
  
Until that day you came my way  
With pleasure I never found  
It all might have been  
Had you been around  
  
One more time, it all might have been  
Had you been around  
Do it again, it all might have been  
Had you been around  
  
Had you been around

He can turn the tides  
And calm an angry sea  
He alone decides  
Who writes a symphony  
  
He lights ev'ry star  
That makes our darkness bright  
He keeps watch all through  
The dark and lonely night  
  
He still finds the time  
To hear a child's small prayer  
Saint or sinners call  
They always find Him there  
  
Though it makes him sad  
To see the way we live  
He'll always say  
"I forgive"

You're a girl that hates to see others happy  
Unless you're happy too  
So you've told the boy I love  
A lot of things that ain't true  
  
And it's wringing my heart  
Cause it's making us drift apart  
So humbly I ask of you  
To undo the wrong that you've done  
  
Please go to him, tell him  
Before he finds someone new  
Cause if I ever lose him  
I don't know what I'll do  
  
Cause he's all I got  
Built my world around him  
Since the day I found him  
  
Girl, your selfishness causes unhappiness  
But why make it hard for me?  
Since you been unhappy in love  
I guess misery loves company  
  
For once in your life  
Consider another's feelings  
Confess the truth  
That you've been concealing  
  
Please go to him, tell him  
Before he finds someone new  
Cause if I ever lose him  
I don't know what I'll do  
  
Cause he's all I got  
Built my world around him  
Since the day found him  
  
I would gladly go to him  
Instead of asking you  
But there might be a shadow of a doubt  
Your gossip might have been true  
  
So tearfully I ask of you  
Please undo the wrong that you've done  
Cause without his love  
I know, I know I can't go on  
  
Please go to him, tell him  
Before he finds someone new  
Cause if I ever lose him  
I don't know what I'll do  
  
Cause he's all I got  
Built my world around him  
Since the day found him  
Can't bear to lose him

Sunny boy  
Now let me tell you how much good  
You've done me, boy  
'Cause when I'm feelin' low  
You give me plenty joy  
Into each lives some rain must fall  
But with you here, there's no rain at all  
  
Sunny boy  
He looks good in everything from silk to corduroy  
(Or [Incomprehensible])  
To see him, I'd walk from Idaho to Illinois  
(Or anywhere)  
Do anything to be with him  
My sunshine when the world is dim  
  
It's sunny boy, sunny boy  
My pride and joy, sunny boy  
  
Sunny boy  
You made my life so sweet  
It's just like honey, boy  
And I love you so much till it ain't funny, boy  
My cloudy days have been declouded  
Since you're here, so keep on shinin'  
  
Sunny boy, sunny boy  
My pride and joy, hey, sunny boy  
My honey boy  
Now only your sweet lovin' can give me joy  
I'm tryin' to tell the world  
That you're my sunny boy

Why should i feel discouraged  
Why should the shadows come  
Why should my heart feel lonely  
And long for heaven and home?  
  
When jesus is my portion  
My constant friend is he  
His eye is on the sparrow  
I know he watches me  
His eye is on the sparrow  
I know he watches me  
  
I sing because I'm happy  
I sing because I'm free  
His eye is on the sparrow  
I know he watches me  
His eye, his eye is on the sparrow  
I know he watches  
I know he watches  
I know he watches me  
  
I sing because i'm happy  
I sing because i'm free  
His eye is on the sparrow  
I know, i know, i know he watches over  
He watches over me

When I think of home  
I think of a place where there's love overflowing  
I wish I was home  
I wish I was back there with the things I been knowing  
  
Wind that makes the tall trees bend into leaning  
Suddenly the snowflakes that fall have a meaning  
Sprinklin' the scene, makes it all clean  
  
Maybe there's a chance for me to go back there  
Now that I have some direction  
It would sure be nice to be back home  
Where there's love and affection  
And just maybe I can convince time to slow up  
Giving me enough time in my life to grow up  
Time be my friend, let me start again  
  
Suddenly my world has changed it's face  
But I still know where I'm going  
I have had my mind spun around in space  
And yet I've watched it growing  
  
If you're list'ning God  
Please don't make it hard to know  
If we should believe in the things that we see  
Tell us, should we run away  
Should we try and stay  
Or would it be better just to let things be?  
  
Living here, in this brand new world  
Might be a fantasy  
But it taught me to love  
So it's real, real to me  
  
And I've learned  
That we must look inside our hearts  
To find a world full of love  
Like yours  
Like me  
  
Like home...

If you really think I'm fine  
Then why don't you just take the time  
And call me  
Baby, hurry, come see me  
Friends all say you speak my name  
Well, let me say  
I feel the same about you  
Can't do without you  
How about you?  
Hey! Baby, what's wrong?  
You look so surprised  
I can tell by the look in your eyes  
That you need me  
And I need you too  
Hey, baby what's wrong  
You know you need me  
And I need you too  
How about you?  
I know all the words  
That I want to say  
But if I do will you walk away  
And leave me here  
By myself with my tears  
Baby I still have my pride  
Even though it's not enough to hide  
My love for you  
Baby, I love you  
How about you?  
Baby, how about you  
Do you need me too  
Baby, how about you  
Do you need me too  
Baby, how about you

Here's a tear, for a souvenir  
And a dream, that's torn at the seams  
Here's a promise you made to me  
Of the tomorrow I'll never see  
And then you're free to go  
  
But I can't give back the love  
I feel for you  
I'm gonna be stuck with it  
No matter what I do  
  
Take these arms that held you close  
I thought I was the one you needed the most  
Take these hands, they're no good to me  
That used to touch you so tenderly  
  
But I can't give back the love  
That's a part of me  
If you want just a little bit  
You have to take all of me  
  
Here's a ring  
That didn't mean a thing  
And the letters you wrote  
That gave my young heart hope  
Take the pillow where my dreams were made  
And the mind, where the thought of you stayed  
But baby, you should know  
  
That I can't give back the love  
I feel for you  
I'm gonna be stuck with it  
No matter what I do  
  
Take these eyes that once could see  
Now reflections of a misery  
The hapiness I thought would last  
Now a becoming just a thing of the past  
  
But I can't give back the love  
That's a part of me  
If you want just a little bit  
You have to take all of me  
  
No, I can't give back  
No, I feel for you  
Oh, I'm gonna be stuck  
No matter what I do  
'Cause it'll grow 'til the world  
Don't go 'round no more  
  
But I can't give back the love  
I feel for you  
I'm gonna be stuck with it  
No matter what I do  
  
But I can't give back the love  
I feel for you  
I'm gonna be stuck with it  
No matter what I do  
  
But I can't give back the love  
I feel for you  
I'm gonna be stuck with it  
No matter what I do

I cried for you  
Now it's your turn to cry over me  
Every road has a turning  
That's one thing I'm learning  
  
I cried for you  
What a fool I used to be  
Now I found two eyes  
A little bit bluer  
I found a heart  
Just a little bit truer  
  
I cried for you  
Now it's your turn to cry over me  
  
I cried for you  
Now it's your turn to cry over me  
Every road has a turning  
That's one thing I'm learning  
  
I cried for you  
What a fool I used to be  
Now I found two eyes  
Just a little bit bluer  
I found a heart  
Just a little bit truer  
  
That I cried for you  
Now it's your turn to cry over me

I guess I'll always love you  
You've got the love I need  
You've got the love I need  
  
Open up your arms  
And let me walk on in  
Open up your heart  
And let me live again  
  
When you left you left with me  
A dream no longer reality  
I live the shadows of our past  
With this love that's born to last  
  
I guess I'll always love you  
You've got the love I need  
You've got the love I need  
  
The only time I'm happy  
Is when you're on my mind  
Every day I live  
All my love I give  
  
I've been a thousand places  
Seen your smile on a thousand faces  
No matter what I try to do  
I'm always dreaming of you  
  
I guess I'll always love you  
You've got the love I need  
You've got the love I need  
  
Every boy that passes by  
I see your sparkle in his eye  
Right away I stop and stare  
Close my eyes and see you there  
  
Whenever I feel almost free  
Memories take hold of me  
I love you now so much more  
Than I ever did before  
  
I guess I'll always love you  
I guess I'll always love you  
I guess I'll always love you

I love you, I love you  
I love you too  
Baby will you call me  
The moment you get there  
  
I love you, I love you  
And i love you too  
Baby will you call me  
The moment you get there  
  
My tears, my dearest of all, darling  
I know, i know, i know  
I know we've got to part  
Baby, baby, baby, it really doesn't hurt me that bad  
Because you're taking me with you and  
I'm keeping you right here in my arms  
  
It's all because i love you  
Call me, call me the hour  
Call me the minute, the second you get there

(Aretha Franklin)  
I love you, I love you  
I love you too  
Baby will you call me  
The moment you get there  
I love you, I love you  
And I love you too  
Baby will you call me  
The moment you get there  
My tears, my dearest of all, darling  
I know, I know, I know  
I know we've got to part  
Baby, baby, baby, it really doesn't hurt me that bad  
Because you're taking me with you and  
I'm keeping you right here in my arms  
It's all because I love you  
Call me, call me the hour  
Call me the minute, the second you get there  

Tired of bein' lonely, tired of bein' blue,  
I wished I had some good man, to tell my troubles to  
Seem like the whole world's wrong, since my man's been gone  
I need a little sugar in my bowl,  
I need a little hot dog, on my roll  
I can stand a bit of lovin', oh so bad,  
I feel so funny, I feel so sad  
I need a little steam-heat, on my floor,  
Maybe I can fix things up, so they'll go  
What's the matter, hard papa, come on and save you mama's soul  
'Cause I need a little sugar, in my bowl, doggone it,  
I need a little sugar in my bowl  
I need a little sugar, in my bowl,  
I need a little hot dog, between my rolls  
You gettin' different, I've been told,  
Move your finger, drop something in my bowl  
I need a little steam-heat on my floor,  
Maybe I can fix things up, so they'll go  
(spoken: Get off your knees, I can't see what you're drivin' at!  
It's dark down there!  
Looks like a snake! see'mon here and drop somethin' here in my bowl,  
Stop your foolin', and drop somethin', in my bowl)

Maybe you wanna give me kisses sweet  
But only for one night and no repeat  
And maybe you'll go away and never call, hey  
And a taste of honey is worse than none at all  
  
Oh little girl, in that case I don't want no part  
Cause I know that, that will break my heart  
Oh, but if you feel like loving me and you got the notion  
I second that emotion, said, if you feel like giving me  
A lifetime of devotion, I second that emotion  
  
Maybe you think that love would tie you down  
And you don't have the time to hang around  
Or maybe you think that love was made for fools  
And so it makes you wise to break the rules  
  
Oh little girl, in that case I don't, I don't want no part  
That would only break my heart  
Ooh, if you feel like lovin' me if you got the notion  
I second that emotion, said, if you feel like givin' me  
A lifetime of devotion, I second that emotion  
  
Ooh, then in that case, I don't want no part  
I do believe that, that would only break my heart  
Oh, but if you feel like lovin' me if you got the notion  
I second that emotion, said, if you feel like givin' me  
A lifetime of devotion, I second that emotion

Last night while we were talking, the way that old friends do  
I suddenly got lost in my yesterdays with you  
I told you that in my heart, you would always be the one  
That I'd lie waking in the dark, pray that you will come  
But I didn't mean to say that  
Somehow it just slipped out  
I swear that I would take it back  
If I could right now  
All I ask is you believe  
I'd forgotten where I was  
With you there so close to me  
I thought that we were still in love  
Oh I knew just what I'd done when you stood up so fast  
And say the friends that we'd become, can't hold on to the past  
You said it's been a long, long time, since love came to an end  
If I hadn't learned to draw the line, it's useless to pretend  
But I didn't mean to say that  
Somehow it just slipped out  
I swear that I would take it back  
If I could right now  
All I ask is you believe  
I'd forgotten where I was  
With you there so close to me  
I thought that we were still in love  
I don't think I could take goodbye, that much is still the truth  
Won't you forgive me just for one night, it's what a friend would do  
'Coz I didn't mean to say that  
Somehow it just slipped out  
I swear that I would take it back  
If I could right now  
All I ask is you believe  
I'd forgotten where I was  
With you there so close to me  
I thought that we were still in love  
Still in love  
I thought that we were still in love  

I want a guy to love me  
One who will love me completely  
Not like the last  
Who's in the past  
Who broke my heart and made me cry  
  
I wish that he could come and kiss me  
And tell me that he misses me  
I know someday  
He'll come my way  
And I'll never be lonely again  
  
I don't need riches like diamond rings  
As long as he loves me, that's everything  
As long as he holds me tight  
As long as he treats me right  
I'll never let him out of my sight  
  
I want a guy with a love that's true  
One that I can tell my troubles to  
He'll be my guy  
And stay by my side  
I'd be so glad if I only had  
  
A guy, a guy  
Why can't I have a guy?  
A guy?

Who knows how long I've loved you  
You know I love you still  
Will I wait a lonely lifetime  
If you want me to, I will  
  
For if I ever saw you  
I didn't catch your name  
But it never really mattered  
I will always feel the same  
  
Love you forever and forever  
Love you with all my heart  
Love you whenever we're together  
Love you when we're apart  
  
And when at last I find you  
Your song will fill the air  
Sing it loud so I can hear you  
And you know I will  
  
Love you forever and forever  
Love you with all my heart  
Love you whenever we're together  
Love you when we're apart  
  
And when at last I find you  
Your song will fill the air  
Sing it loud so I can hear you  
Make it easy to be near you  
For the things you do endear you to me  
All you know I will, I will

At first I was afraid, I was petrified  
Kept thinkin' I could never live without you by my side  
Then I spent so many nights Just thinking how you did me wrong  
And I grew strong  
And I learned how to get along  
  
And so you're back from outer space  
I just walked in to find you here, with that look upon your face  
I should have changed that stupid lock  
I should have made you leave your key  
If I had known for just one second you'd be back to bother me  
  
Go on now, go walk out the door  
Just turn around now  
'Cause you're not welcome anymore  
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye?  
Did you think I'd crumble?  
Did you think I'd lay down and die?  
Oh no not I, I will survive  
For as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive  
I've got all my life to live  
And I've got all my love to give  
I'll survive  
I will survive  
Hey hey  
  
(I, I will survive)  
Hey hey  
(I, I will survive)  
Every day  
(I, I will survive)  
Oh yeah  
  
It took all the strength I had not to fall apart  
Just trying hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart  
And I spent oh so many nights just feeling sorry for myself  
I used to cry, but now I hold my head up high  
And you see me, somebody new  
I'm not that chained up little person still in love with you  
And so you felt like dropping in and just expect me to be free  
But now I'm savin' all my lovin' for someone who's lovin' me  
  
Go on now, go walk out the door  
Just turn around now  
You're not welcome anymore  
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye?  
Did you think I'd crumble?  
Did you think I'd lay down and die?  
Oh no not I, I will survive  
Oh as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive  
I've got all my life to live  
And I've got all my love to give  
I'll survive  
I will survive  
Hey hey  
  
Go now, go walk out the door  
Just turn around now  
'Cause you're not welcome anymore  
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye?  
Did you think I'd crumble?  
Did you think I'd lay down and die?  
Oh no not I, I will survive  
Oh as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive  
I've got all my life to live  
And I've got all my love to give  
I'll survive  
I will survive  
I will survive  
  
(I, I will survive)  
Hey  
(I, I will survive)  
Every day  
(I, I will survive)  
Yeah yeah  
  
(I, I will survive)  
Oh  
(I, I will survive)  
I will survive  
(I, I will survive)  
  
(I, I will survive)  
I've got all my love to give  
(I, I will survive)  
I've got all my life to live  
(I, I will survive)  
My loving is not in vain, oh no  
  
(I, I will survive)  
I will survive  
(I, I will survive)  
I will survive  
(I, I will survive)  
Hey

Day after day I must face a world of strangers  
Where I don't belong,  
I'm not that strong  
It's nice to know that there's someone I can turn to  
Who will always care  
You're always there  
  
When there's no getting over that rainbow  
When my small list of dreams won't come true  
I can take all the madness the world has to give  
But I won't last a day without you  
  
So many times when the city seems to be  
Without a friendly face,  
A lonely place  
It's nice to know that you'll be there if I need you  
And you always smile  
It's all worth while  
  
When there's no getting over that rainbow  
When my small list of dreams won't come true  
I can take all the madness the world has to give  
But I won't last a day without you  
  
Touch me and I end up singing  
Troubles seem to up and disappear  
You touch me with the love you're bringin'  
I can't really lose when you're near  
When you're near my love  
If all my friends have forgotten all their promises  
They're not unkind,  
Just hard to find  
One look at you and I know that  
I could learn to live without the rest  
I found the best  
  
When there's no getting over that rainbow  
When my small list of dreams won't come true  
I can take all the madness the world has to give  
But I won't last a day without you  
  
When there's no getting over that rainbow  
When my small list of dreams won't come true  
I can take all the madness the world has to give  
But I won't last a day...

I've got a funny kind of guy  
Nobody knows him  
Any better than I  
  
Says without me  
He can get along  
But I know that's just a man's way  
Of saying he's strong  
  
But I wouldn't change him, no  
Oh, I wouldn't change his funny ways  
'Cause he's the cause of my sunny days  
And though sometimes he brings me little tears  
Still love the man he is  
  
If I do something to please him  
He never gives me credit  
If I think he'll bring me candy and roses  
Huh, I might as well forget it  
  
He's the kind of a man  
Who likes his privacy  
And when a mood hits him  
I know when to let him be  
  
But I wouldn't change him, no  
I wouldn't change his funny, funny ways  
'Cause he's the cause of my sunny days  
And though sometimes he brings me little tears  
Still love the man he is  
  
Sometimes when he hurts me so bad  
I think I've got migraine in the head  
All he has to do is touch me  
Tears disappear  
I'll forgive him in a minute  
  
I have to pretend  
There ain't much I know  
He's the kind of a man  
Who likes to run the show  
  
But I wouldn't change him, no  
I wouldn't change his funny ways  
'Cause he's the cause of my sunny days  
Though sometimes he brings me little tears  
  
Still love the man he is  
Oh, I love that man  
I wouldn't change his funny ways  
And I wouldn't change the man he is

Hey, oh  
Hey yeah  
Hey baby, hey baby  
  
The phone is ringing  
And I'm running late  
I've no time to get it  
'Cause I'm expecting you at eight  
  
Heard your voice on the message  
I'm surprised you called  
Said you're all tied up  
And you ain't comin' at all  
  
If you're not gonna love me right  
Baby don't love me at all  
You're just gonna make me crazy  
If you're not gonna love me right  
Baby don't love me at all  
If you're not gonna love me right, oh  
  
(baby don't love, baby don't love me)  
At all  
(baby don't love, baby don't love me)  
At all  
  
Another box of roses outside on my porch  
Twelve long excuses none of them stop the hurt  
Where's this going, do you really care?  
Is this real love, I don't know anymore I swear  
  
If you're not gonna love me right  
Baby don't love me at all  
Baby don't make me crazy  
If you're not gonna love me right  
Baby don't love me at all  
If you're not gonna love me right, yeah  
  
(baby don't love, baby don't love me)  
Oh baby  
(baby don't love, baby don't love me)  
I really want you, oh baby  
  
(baby don't love, baby don't love me)  
If you're not gonna love me right  
(baby don't love, baby don't love me)  
Baby just make me crazy  
  
Baby, I want you here  
If you're not here it makes me feel like  
I can't trust you  
You make me crazy if you really love me  
You see  
  
Oh, I get confused when you hold me next to you  
I want to go further, oh baby yes I do  
I just can't hold on to something that won't last  
So we'd better slow down, and maybe not go so fast  
Maybe not go so fast  
  
If you're not gonna love me right  
Baby don't love me at all  
You're just gonna make me crazy  
(If you're not gonna love me right)  
If you're not gonna love me  
Baby don't love me, baby don't love me, baby don't love me  
If you're not gonna love me right  
  
If you're not gonna love me right  
Baby, don't love me at all  
You're just gonna make me crazy  
If you're not gonna love me right  
Baby, don't love me at all  
You're just gonna make me crazy  
  
(Baby don't love, baby don't love me)  
Baby don't love, baby don't love me  
(Baby don't love, baby don't love me)  
Baby don't love, baby don't love me  
  
(Baby don't love, baby don't love me)  
Baby don't love, baby don't love me  
(Baby don't love, baby don't love me)  
If you're not gonna do it right  
  
(Baby don't love, baby don't love me)  
If you're not gonna do it right  
(Baby don't love, baby don't love me)  
If you're not gonna do it right  
  
(Baby don't love, baby don't love me)  
Baby don't love, baby don't love me  
(Baby don't love, baby don't love me)  
Baby don't love, baby don't love, baby don't love me

I will build you a castle with a tower so high  
Till it reaches the moon  
I'll gather melodies from birdies that fly  
And compose you a tune  
  
Give you lovin' as warm  
As Mama's oven  
And if that don't do  
Then I'll try something new  
  
I will take you away with me as far as I can  
To Venus or Mars  
There we will love with your hand in my hand  
You'll be king of the stars  
  
Everyday we can play  
On the Milky Way  
And if that don't do  
I'll have to try something new  
  
I will bring you a flower from the floor of the sea  
To wear in your hair, thank you  
I'll do anything and every little thing to make you happy boy  
To show you that I care  
  
I'll pretend I'm jealous  
Of all the fellas  
And if that don't do  
Then I'll try something new  
  
I'll try something new  
I'll try something new  
I'll try something new  
I'll try something new  
  
I'll try something new  
I'll try something new

I roll the dice  
Seven eleven

Gamblin' you'd be mine  
And I'm so glad  
I took a chance on you baby  
Say I'm so glad  
I took the chance on you baby  
My friends all say

But I fooled them, y'all

I want the world to know  
Got to let it show

There's a new me coming out  
And I just had to live  
And I want to give  
I'm completely positive  
I think this time around  
I am gonna do it  
Like you never do it  
Like you never knew it  
Oh, I'll make it through  
  
The time has come for me  
To break out of the shell  
I have to shout  
That I'm coming out  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
I've got to show the world  
All that I want to be  
And all my billities  
There's so much more to me  
Somehow, I have to make them  
Just understand  
I got it well in hand  
And, oh, how I've planned  
I'm spreadin' love  
There's no need to fear  
And I just feel so glad  
Every time I hear

Goodbye my love, happy life, my love  
I'm tired and I just can't take no more  
Tired of being tough 'cause enough is enough  
This time I'm really headed for the door

Walk me into something good

I'm gonna shower you with love and affection  
Look out it's coming in your direction

For every day we are apart  
I'll hunger for every wasted hour

Ooh, I'm gonna make you love me  
Take that, yeah  
Yes, I will

I'm in the world  
I'm in the world  
I'm in the world  
I must be part of it  
At last convinced  
To the right of it  
I'm in the world  
For some reason or another  
Sometimes I get up  
And sometimes I don't bother  
But I'm here  
I'm here for, oh Lord, who knows?  
My light gets dim  
Then it glows, ooh yeah  
I'm in the world  
I'm in the world  
I'm in the world  
And being what it is  
I've learnt to look  
To look beyond the tears  
I'm in the world  
Though hearts don't break even  
I'll take my chances  
'Cause it ain't about leaving  
I'm here  
I'm here and I won't apologize  
Maybe at the end there'll be a surprise  
Oh, yeah  
'Cause I'm in the world  
Good or bad  
I'm in the world  
Yes, I'm here  
I'm in the world  
I'm here, I'm here  
I'm in the world  
I'm in the world  
I'm here  
I'm in the world  
Oh, yes, oh, yes  
I'm in the world  
Good or bad  
I'm here in the world  

I remember when  
I was five and you were ten, boy  
You knew that I was shy  
So you teased and made me cry  
But I loved you  
  
Then one day you came  
You told me you were leaving  
You gave your folks the blame  
And made me cry again  
When you said  
  
Little girl  
Please don't wait for me  
Wait patiently for love  
Someday will surely come  
Ooh, little girl  
Please don't wait for me  
Wait patiently for love  
Someday will surely come  
And I'm still waiting  
  
I'm waiting  
Ooh, still waiting  
I'm just a fool  
Ooh, I'm a fool  
To keep waiting  
  
Then someone finally came  
He told me that he loved me  
I put him off with lies  
He could see I had no eyes  
So he left me once again alone  
Like a child without her playmate  
I had to face the truth  
I was still in love with you  
But you said:  
  
Little girl  
Please don't wait for me  
Wait patiently for love  
Someday will surely come  
Ooh, little girl  
Please don't wait for me  
Wait patiently for love  
Someday will surely come  
And I'm still waiting  
  
Love has never shown his face  
Since the day you walked out that door  
You filled my life with empty space  
Come back  
Can't you see it's you I'm waiting for  
  
Don't you know I'm waiting  
I'm waiting for love  
For you, I miss you  
I'm waiting  
Come on back, boy  
I need you  
I want you  
That's what my friends says  

Hello baby, it's a long time  
I know you're here  
I feel you close to me  
So much to say but  
Making all the words  
I save them all inside  
Then I see you and they disappear  
Like leaves beneath the snow  
And life don't wait for everyone  
And yesterday, I let you go  
  
I'm watching you tonight  
And I waited for so long  
I've been living on your memory  
In a world where we were one  
And you told me you could make it on your own  
  
I'm watching you tonight  
And it's making me cry  
When I lost you, I lost everything  
But our love should never die  
Not mine, my love is born to be your love  
Oh baby  
To make history near you  
But the moment when I see me in your eyes  
You're gone, you're gone  
  
You can say goodbye if you want to  
I love you but I'll try to understand  
But in my soul I know it's meant to be  
Together you and me  
  
But I know you came to fade away  
Like voices in the wind  
And I wonder if you feel my love  
It's stronger than it's ever been  
  
I'm watching you tonight  
And there's no other one  
All the love we gave eternally  
Now it's dying in the sun  
Not mine, my love was born to be your love  
Oh baby  
To make history near you  
But that moment when I see me in your eyes  
You're gone, you're gone, you're gone

I was lost in darkness all alone  
On the streets no place that I  
I could call my own  
  
Time's so hard  
Rain everywhere down below  
Until the day I heard your voice  
Telling me which way to go  
  
Come on out into the life  
Hold on love it's alright  
  
It's a wonderful life  
Now that you made me see  
My life's complete  
It's in harmony  
  
It's a wonderful life  
Now that you're here with me  
I can't believe I'm in ecstacy  
  
I was blind but love made me see  
It's everything I was searchin' for  
Was right in front of me  
  
Loving you made me very strong  
You gave me the strength I needed  
So I could carry on  
  
Come on out into the light  
Hold on love it's alright  
  
It's a wonderful life  
You made me see  
My life's complete  
It's in harmony  
  
It's a wonderful life  
Now that you're here with me  
I can't believe I'm in ecstacy  
  
I feel light as a feather  
Every day's beautiful weather  
In your arms I remain  
Forever and ever  
  
It's a wonderful life  
That you made me see  
My life's complete  
It's in harmony  
  
It's a wonderful life  
Now that you're here with me  
I can't believe I'm in ecstacy  
  
It's a wonderful life  
You made me see  
My life's complete  
It's in harmony  
  
It's a wonderful life  
Now that you're here with me  
I can't believe I'm in ecstacy

Didn't know 'till today  
That you would love for me to say  
All of the things I feel  
Though you don't doubt they're real  
  
Insecure, very shy  
Are the only reasons I have why  
I never say the things that  
You would love to hear  
All the words I try  
Disappoint me and I cry  
So they're words I don't often say  
  
But it's in my love, it's in my feeling  
It's in the very same heart  
That loved you from the start  
It's in my heat, it's in the spirit  
And it's got me totally high  
It's just hard me to say why  
  
Kind of sad, kind of blue  
Because I wanted to tell you  
That you are in my heart  
Though we are far apart  
Didn't know how to say  
All the little things to make you stay  
And not to keep assuming  
You could read my mind  
  
You're the one I love  
Though it's hard for you to know  
'Cause the words I don't always say  
  
But it's in my love, it's in my feeling  
It's in the very same heart  
That loved you from the start  
It's in the heat, it's in the spirit  
And it's got me totally high  
It's just hard me to say why  
  
It's hard for me

I can't cover up my feelings  
In the name of love  
Or play it safe  
For a while that was easy  
And if living for myself  
Is what I'm guilty of  
Go on and sentence me  
I'll still be free  
  
It's my turn  
To see what I can see  
I hope you'll understand  
This time's just for me  
  
Because it's my turn  
With no apologies  
I've given up the truth  
To those I've tried to please  
  
But now it's my turn  
If I don't have all the answers  
At least I know I'll take my share of chances  
Ain't no use of holding of  
When nothing stays the same  
  
So I'll let it rain  
'Cause the rain ain't gonna hurt me  
And I'll let you go  
'Though I know it won't be easy  
  
It's my turn  
With no more room for lies  
For years I'd seen my life  
Through someone else's eyes  
  
And now it's my turn  
To try and find my way  
And if I should get lost  
At least I'll own today  
  
It's my turn  
Yes, it's my turn  
And there ain't no use in holding of  
When nothing stays the same  
  
So I'll let it rain  
'Cause the rain ain't gonna hurt me  
And I'll let you go  
'Though I know it won't be easy  
  
It's my turn  
To see what I can see  
I hope you'll understand  
This time's just for me  
  
Because it's my turn  
To turn and say good-bye  
I sure would like to know  
That you're still on my side  
  
Because it's my turn  
It's my turn  
  
It's my turn  
To start from number one  
Trying to undo  
Some damage that's been done  
  
But now it's my turn  
To reach and touch the sky  
No one's gonna say  
At least I didn't try  
  
It's my turn  
Yes, it's my turn  
It's my turn  
It's my turn  
It's my turn  

Get the message  
Oh, it's never too late  
Get the message

You still got chances of turning around

No, it's never too late no, no, no, no

Time keeps changin' everything  
Sometimes tearin' down  
The treasures that it brings  
Ever strong  
You'll make it through  
The secret lies in knowing  
That it's up to you  
Say it with me now  
  
Get the message  
Oh, it's never too late

That it's never too late  
  
Get the message  
Oh, it's never too late  
Get the message  
Oh, it's never too late

I don't understand it 'cause you won't say yes  
But you don't say no  
Sayin' no shouldn't you keep holdin' out  
But you don't let go  
I'm givin' up on trying  
To sell you things that you ain't buying  
  
It's your move  
I played all of mine  
Time is running out  
Make your move  
Or we can't go on  
Till you understand  
It's all in your hands  
It's your move  
  
You're giving me the business with that old come on  
But you don't come across  
You get me so excited don't you know you're such a tease  
When I think you're gettin' hot, you're not  
So what's the problem, what's wrong  
This kiss and miss you know it can't go on  
  
It's your move  
I played all of mine  
Time is running out  
Make your move  
Or we can't go on  
Till you understand  
It's all in your hands  
It's your move  
  
I'm givin' up on trying now it's  
Girl, if you ain't buyin' now it's  
I gave it all I got now it's  
I thought you were hot but you're not so it's  
Your move, your move your move  
  
It's your move  
I played all of mine  
Time is running out  
Make your move  
Or we can't go on  
Till you understand  
It's all in your hands  
It's your move

Till you understand  
It's all in your hands  
It's your move

How glad the many millions  
Of Toms and Dicks and Williams  
Would be  
To capture me  
  
But you had such persistence  
You wore down my resistance  
I fell  
And it was swell  
  
You're my big and brave and handsome Romeo  
How I won you I will never never know  
It's not that you're attractive  
But oh my heart grew active  
When you came into view  
  
I've got a crush on you, sweetie pie  
All the day and nighttime, hear me sigh  
I never had the least notion  
That I could fall with so much emotion  
Taken from  
Could you coo  
Could you care  
For a cunning cottage we could share  
The world will pardon my mush  
Cause I've got a crush, my baby, on you  
  
Could you coo  
Could you care  
For a cunning cottage we could share  
The world will pardon my mush  
Cause I have got a crush,  
My baby, on you

Keep an eye.  
Keep an eye  
Keep an eye  
On your close friend  
  
Keep an eye  
Keep an eye  
Keep an eye  
On your close friend  
  
'Cause what you got, that'll make you lose  
And then turn around and step in your shoes  
I say they'll turn around  
And step in your shoes  
  
I stood there, numb  
Watchin' my friend walk away  
With my love on her arm  
  
Oh, what she said was  
"Sorry for what I had to do  
But you see I love him just as much as you."  
  
Keep an eye  
Keep an eye  
On your close friend  
  
Keep an eye  
Keep an eye  
You better watch out  
For your close friend  
  
The devil's workshop is a busy place  
On top of evil there's an innocent face  
Oh, on top of evil he puts an innocent face  
She was just like a spider  
Only twice as smart  
  
Kindness was a thread  
She used to weave my world apart  
There were three of us seen all over town  
Now there's only two  
Someone's missing  
Guess who?  
  
Now I see how she schemed  
And worked her way in between  
Planted seeds of mistrust  
To make us fight unaware  
Her comforting ways when I would cry  
Shadowed the look of triumph in her eye  
Just like a snake on the limb tree  
A friend is an enemy you can see  
  
'Cause what you got, that'll make you lose  
And then turn around and step in your shoes  
I said they'll turn around  
And step in your shoes  
  
So you better keep an eye on your close friend  
You better watch out for your close friend  
Don't trust nobody  
Don't trust nobody  
Keep an eye on your close friend  
Keep an eye  
Don't trust nobody  
Keep an eye on your close friend  
You better watch out for your close friend  
She was just like a spider  
Only twice as smart

Something about you makes me feel this way  
Boy I want to know what you're startin'  
Baby you can relax as a matter of fact  
There's a time for love and that time's now  
  
Since the mood's right  
I only want to see you by the moonlight  
While we make sweet love  
By the starlight  
Baby let me take control  
Oh baby  
  
Keep it right there  
Keep it right there  
Keep it right there  
All night, baby all night  
  
Keep it right there  
Keep it right there  
Keep it right there  
All night, baby all night  
  
Can you stay right here and you hold me tight  
All through the night  
Doesn't that sound real nice  
If control could be taken, would you take control of me  
And lead me to ecstasy  
  
Since the mood's right  
I only want to see you by the moonlight  
While we make sweet love  
By the starlight  
Baby let me take control  
Oh baby  
  
Keep it right there  
Keep it right there  
Keep it right there  
Keep it there baby  
All night, baby all night  
  
Keep it right there  
Keep it right there  
Keep it right there  
All night, baby all night  
  
Keep it right there  
Keep it right there  
Keep it right there  
All night, baby all night  
Baby, keep it right there  
  
Keep it right there

I've been waiting  
Can't ignore what I feel inside my heart  
I won't hold back I'll it go tonight  
Gonna take control  
  
Keep it right there  
Keep it right there  
Keep it right there  
All night, baby all night

Kiss me now  
While my lips are burning up for your sweet taste  
Kiss me now  
Long to feel the fiery aid of your embrace  
Kiss me now  
That you're someone very special in my life  
Kiss me now  
Love you, and I want you by my side  
Kiss me now  
  
Love me now  
I ain't had no loving on since yesterday  
Baby, tell me how  
You expect someone to live a life that way  
Each and every day, baby  
I've been hoping that you will give in  
Give in, give in, give in  
You mean more to me than just a friend  
  
Kiss me now  
I've been waiting too long  
Years, my dear, my dear, my dear  
I've been very lonely  
And I wish that you were here  
So I could hold you near  
  
I've been hoping that you will give in  
Give in, give in, give in  
You mean more to me than just a friend  
Kiss me now  
Kiss me  
  
Somebody, you gotta kiss me now  
Love me now  
I've been waiting too long  
Years, my dear, my dear  
I've been very lonely  
And I wish that you were here  
So I could hold you  
Hoping that you will give in  
You mean more to me than just a friend  
Kiss me now  
Kiss me now  
Kiss me now  
Kiss me now

The bittersweet sadness of time passing by  
Trying to hold back the years  
you try to reach out and touch yesterday  
But yesterday just disappears  
  
We've shared a lot of sadness  
We've shared a lot of pain  
Let's make good use of the time that remains  
  
Let's make every moment count  
Let's taste the richness of life to it's fullest amount  
Between me and you and all we've been through  
There are no problems that we can't surmount  
Let's make every moment count  
Let's make every moment count  
  
I still remember the day we first meet  
We both didn't have a care  
The years have flown, but we've both grown  
We're none of the worse for the wear  
  
We're only just beginning  
I'm still your lover and your friend  
And it's never too late to dream again  
  
You say we've seen the best of all our memories  
But if your heart and soul are in it  
We'll make a new one every minute  

When I was very young  
The world was younger than I  
As merry as a carousel  
  
The circustent was strong  
With every star in the sky  
Above the ring I loved so well  
  
Now the young world has grown old  
Gone are the tinsle and gold  
  
Sit there and count your fingers  
What can you do?  
Oh girl you're through  
All you can count on are your fingers  
Unlucky little girl blue  
  
Sit there and count the raindrops  
Falling on you  
It's time you knew  
All you can count on are the raindrops  
That fall on little girl blue  
  
No use oh girl  
You may as well surrender  
Your hope is getting slender  
Why won't somebody send a tender blue boy  
To cheer little girl blue

You think that I don't feel love  
But what I feel for you is real love  
In other's eyes I see reflected  
A hurt, scorned, rejected  
  
Love child, never meant to be  
Love child, born in poverty  
Love child, never meant to be  
Love child, take a look at me  
  
I started my life in an old, cold run down tenement slum  
My father left, he never even married mom  
I shared the guilt my mama knew  
So afraid that others knew I had no name  
  
This love we're contemplating  
Is worth the pain of waiting  
We'll only end up hating  
The child we maybe creating  
  
Love child, never meant to be  
Love child, (scorned by) society  
Love child, always second best  
Love child, different from the rest  
  
Mm, baby (hold on, hold on, just a little bit)  
Mm, baby (hold on, hold on, just a little bit)  
I started school, in a worn, torn, dress that somebody threw out  
I knew the way it felt, to always live in doubt  
To be without the simple things  
So afraid my friends would see the guilt in me  
  
Don't think that I don't need you  
Don't think I don't want to please you  
No child of mine 'll be bearing  
The name of shame I've been wearing  
  
Love child, love child, never quite as good  
Afraid, ashamed, misunderstood  
  
But I'll always love you  
I'll always love you  
I'll always love you  
I'll always love you  
I'll always love you  
I'll always love you

Ah  
If there's a cure for this  
I don't want it  
Don't want it  
If there's a remedy  
I'll run from it  
From it  
  
Think about it all the time  
Never let it out of my mind  
'cause I love you  
  
I've got the sweetest hangover  
I don't want to get over  
Sweetest hangover  
  
Yeah, I don't want to get over  
I don't want to get  
I don't want to get, over  
  
Ooh, I don't need no cure  
I don't need no cure  
I don't need no cure  
  
Sweet lovin'  
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet love  
Sweet, sweet love  
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet love  
  
Don't call a doctor  
Don't call her momma  
Don't call her preacher  
  
No, I don't need it  
I don't want it  
  
Sweet love, I love you  
Sweet love, need love  
  
If there's a cure for this  
I don't want it  
I don't want it no  
If there's a cure for this  
I don't need it  
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet love  
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet love  
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet love  
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet love

Sometimes we make each other cry  
Sometimes we're locked inside the prisons of our pride  
And sometimes we break each others heart with the words we say  
Let anger get in the way too many times  
But always after all, all  
Love is all that matters  
After everything, one thing remains the same  
One thing we cannot change  
We all have one heart  
And one heart needs another  
Love, love is all that matters  
Love is all that matters, it matters after all  
Sometimes we search this world for gold  
When all we really need is just a hand to hold  
Sometimes we let the greatest treasure just slip away  
With words we forget to say too many times  
But always after all, all  
Love is all that matters  
After everything, one thing remains the same  
One thing we cannot change  
We, we all have one heart  
And one heart needs another  
Love, love is all that matters  
Love is all that matters, it matters after all  
After all that we've been through  
It comes down to one simple truth  
You need me, I need you  
'Cause love is all that matters  
Love is all that matters  
It matters after all  
Love is all that matters  
It's the only thing that matters  
It matters after all  
Love is all that matters  

It's very clear  
Our love is here to stay  
Not for a year  
But ever and a day  
  
The radio  
And the telephone  
And the movies that we know  
May just be passing fancies  
And in time may go  
  
But oh my dear  
Our love is here to stay  
Together we're  
Going a long, long way  
  
In time the rockies may crumble  
Gibraltar may tumble  
They're only made of clay but  
Our love is here to stay  
  
The radio  
And the telephone  
And the movies that we know  
May just be passing fancies  
And in time may go  
  
But oh my dear  
Our love is here to stay  
Together we're  
Going a long, long way  
  
In time the rockies may crumble  
Gibraltar may tumble  
They're only made of clay but  
Our love is here to  
Our love is here to  
Our love is here to stay

The love bug done bit me,  
Didn't mean for him to get me,  
Woo, get up in the morning  
And I'm filled with desire,  
No, no, I can't stop the fire,  
Love is real live wire,  
Oo, it's a burning sensation,  
Far beyond imagination.  
  
Love Is Like An Itching In My Heart, tearing it all apart,  
Just an itching in my heart,  
And, baby, I can't scratch it.  
  
Keeps me sighing, oo  
Keeps me yearning,  
No mama can't help me,  
No daddy can't help me  
I've been bitten by the love bug,  
And I need some information  
o help me out of this situation,  
Now, when you're ill you take a pill,  
When you're thirsty, drink your fill,  
What you gonna do, oh yeah,  
when love gets a hold, a hold on you,  
Love Is Like An Itching In My Heart,  
And, baby, I can't scratch it.  
  
Love is a nagging irritation,  
Causing my heart complication,  
Love is a growing infection,  
And I don't know the correction,  
Got me rocking and a-reeling,  
And I can't shake the feeling.  
Love Is Like An Itching In My Heart,  
tearing it all apart,  
Just an Itching in my heart,  
And, baby, I can't scratch it.  
  
  

Whenever I touch you lately, you seem to pull away  
Okay, maybe I'm trying too hard to hang on  
But whenever I hold you, you never look into my eyes, surprised  
I guess I was fooling myself all along  
Love lies 'cause it doesn't last forever  
Love lies, it makes you feel so clever  
You give and it just takes  
And leaves your heart to ache, love lies  
Whenever I kiss you, you never want to lose control, so cold  
It's taken so long to find out  
But now I see that we can't even talk now  
How your love always turned me on  
They're gone, this isn't how I thought love is gonna be  
Love lies 'cause it doesn't last forever  
Love lies though it makes you feel so clever  
You can give and it just takes  
And leaves your heart to ache, love lies  
Love lies, love lies  
Love lies, love lies  

Love me  
  
Love me the way that you love me  
The way that you do when you're dreaming of me  
Love me the way that you love me  
Give me the pleasure that makes me love you too  
  
Hey, the touch of your hands  
Awakens feelings deep inside me  
You know  
The warmth of your breath  
Is like a soft wind sent to guide me  
All those sweet sensations  
Let me feel them now  
  
Love me the way that you love me  
The way that you do when you're dreaming of me  
Love me the way that you love me  
Give me the pleasure that makes me love you too  
  
Oh, we're starting together  
I feel your love is flowing through me  
You know  
Whatever you're doing  
I love the way  
You do it to me  
All those sweet sensations  
Let me feel them now  
Ooh,  
  
Love me the way that you love me  
The way that you do when you're dreaming of me  
Love me the way that you love me  
Give me the pleasure that makes me love you too  
  
Ooh,  
I see the love on your face is glowing  
I feel your lovin' inside me growin'  
I know exactly just where you're goin'  
Let me come with you  
  
Love me the way that you love me  
The way that you do when you're dreaming of me  
Love me the way that you love me  
Give me the pleasure that makes me love you too  
  
Love me the way that you love me  
The way that you do when you're dreaming of me  
Love me the way that you love me  
Give me the pleasure that makes me love you too

When I don't see you  
And I don't know where you've been  
There gets to be a question in my mind  
It hurts to love you  
And the knife goes through the heart of me  
When you're gone I lose a part of me  
That's hard to find  
  
Don't want to fall asleep without you  
Don't want to wake  
Don't want to wake up when you're gone  
I don't know what you do that makes me love you  
But then love don't mean surrender  
And it's time I let it show  
You've got someone else in love with you  
And I deserve to know  
You've been laying our  
  
Love on the line  
That's my suspicion  
When I see her in your eyes  
Love undermined  
No ammunition  
I don't want to love you paralyzed  
I don't want to love you paralyzed  
  
Some misty morning  
When she does the same to you  
When she makes you feel like I do  
That's the day  
But she can't have you  
She can't build a wall around you  
She can't love you like I love you anyway  
  
I know by midnight if you leave me  
And no lies can make the difference  
More hearts get broken now than need be  
And it's right to face the woman  
That steal the away man  
If there's anything to get you back  
That I must do I can  
And our love will never be  
  
Love on the line  
That's my suspicion  
When I can see her in your eyes  
Love undermined  
I'm on a mission  
I don't want to love you paralyzed  
I don't want to love you paralyzed  
  
And my life I won't surrender  
And I'll find out where you go  
There's someone else in love with you  
And I deserve to know  
And it's dying in the heart of me  
And our love should never be  
  
Love on the line  
That's my suspicion  
When I can see her in your eyes  
No ammunition  
I don't want to love you paralyzed  
I don't want to love you paralyzed  
  
Love on the line  
That's my suspicion  
When I can see her in your eyes  
Love undermined  
I'm on a mission  
I don't want to love you paralyzed  
I don't want to love you paralyzed

When I wake up in the morning, love  
And the sunlight hurts my eyes  
And something without warning, love  
Bears heavy on my mind  
  
Then I look at you  
And the world's all right with me  
Just one look at you  
And I know it's gonna be  
A lovely day  
lovely day, lovely day, lovely day  
  
When the day that lies ahead of me  
Seems impossible to face  
When someone else instead of me  
Always seems to know the way  
  
Then I look at you  
And the world's all right with me  
Just one look at you  
And I know it's gonna be  
A lovely day  
  
When the day that lies ahead of me  
Seems impossible to face  
When someone else instead of me  
Always seems to know the way  
  
Then I look at you  
And the world's alright with me  
Just one look at you  
And I know it's gonna be  
A lovely day

I don't know why  
But I'm feeling so sad  
I long to try  
Something I never had  
Never had no kissing  
Ooh, what I've been missing  
Lover man, oh, where can you be?  
The night is cold  
And I'm so all alone  
I'll give my soul  
Just to call you my own  
Hugging and kissing  
Ooh, what we've been missing  
Lover man, oh, where can you be?  
I've heard it say  
That the thrill of romance  
Can be like a heavenly dream  
I go to bed with the prayer  
That you'll make love to me  
Strange as it seems  
Someday we'll meet  
And you'll dry all my tears  
Then whisper sweet little things in my ears  
Hugging and kissing  
Ooh, what we've been missing  
Lover man, oh, where can you be?  
I've heard it say  
That the thrill of romance  
Can be like a heavenly dream  
I go to bed with the prayer  
That you'll make love to me  
Strange as it seems  
Someday we'll meet  
And you'll dry all my tears  
Then whisper sweet little things in my ears  
Hugging and kissing  
Ooh, what we've been missing  
Lover man, oh, where can you be?  

(charlie smalls)  
  
Say what you wanna  
But I'm here to stay  
'cause I'm a mean ole lion  
You can go where you're gonna  
But don't get in my way  
I'm a mean ole lion  
  
You'll be standing in a draft  
If you don't hear me laugh  
And if you happen to come around  
Well, you best not make me frown  
For I just might knock you down  
I'm a mean ole lion  
  
You know I'm ready to fight  
And turn your day into night  
'cause I'm a mean ole lion  
If you're half bright  
You'll detour to the right  
From a mean ole lion  
  
All you strangers better beware  
This is the king of the jungle here  
And if I happen to let you slide  
Don't just stand here  
Run and hide  
You just caught my better side  
  
I'm a mean ole lion  
  
Look,  
You better beware  
This is the king of the jungle here  
And if I happen to let you slide  
Don't stand here  
Run and hide  
You just caught my better side  
  
I'm a mean ole lion  
I'm a mean ole lion

Mirror, mirror  
On the wall  
You said you had the answers to it all  
You never told me I'd take a fall  
  
Mirror, mirror  
On the wall  
  
You, you turned my life  
Into a paperback novel  
Words that come to life  
Inside your little melodrama  
  
Chapter one  
When I was young  
I came to you with my problems  
Chapter two  
You promised me love  
And anything that I desired  
  
[Chorus]  
Tell me mirror, mirror on the wall  
Thought you said you had the answers to it all  
Never told me I was gonna take a fall  
Tell me mirror, mirror on the wall  
  
You have nailed my heart  
Upon the wall for your pleasures  
You have cast a spell  
That cannot ever be broken  
  
And now  
My eyes grow tired  
I watch my picture getting older  
But I  
Remain the same  
Trapped in this mirror forever  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I talk to you each night  
And I follow your advise  
You've been wrong  
What's the price I have to pay  
For this fairy tale thing called love?  
Let me go!  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Let me go  
Mirror, mirror [Repeat: x4]  
  
Tell me mirror, mirror on the wall  
Thought you said you had the answers to it all  
Never told me I was gonna take a fall  
Tell me mirror, mirror on the wall  
  
Tell me mirror [Repeat: x4]

Since you've been away  
I've been down and lonely  
Since you've been away  
I've been thinking of you  
Trying to understand  
The reason you left me  
What were you going through?  
  
I'm missing you  
Tell me why the road turns  
Ooh ooh  
I'm missing you  
Tell me why the road turns  
  
As i look around  
I see things that remind me  
Just to see you smile  
Made my heart fill with joy  
I'll still recall  
All those dreams we shared together  
Where did you run to, boy?  
  
I'm missing you  
Tell me why the road turns  
Ooh ooh  
I'm missing you  
Tell me why the road turns  
  
Sometimes i've wondered  
I didn't understand  
Just where you were trying to go  
Only you knew the plan  
And i tried to be there  
But you wouldn't let me in  
  
But now you've gone away boy  
I feel so broken hearted  
I knew the day we started  
That we were meant to be  
If only you'd let me!  
I've cried so many tears  
Gotta face now all my fears  
We let time slip away  
I need you boy  
Here today!  
  
There was so much you gave me  
To my heart  
To my soul  
There was so much of your dreams  
That were never told  
You had so much hope  
For a brighter day  
Why were you my flower  
Plucked away  
  
I'm missing you  
Tell me why the road turns  
Ooh ooh  
I'm missing you  
Tell me why the road turns

Have I ever been here before  
I remember hearing your name, sir  
If my conversation lacks discretion  
It's the same old foolish game  
  
Did I ever give you my key  
Did you ever walk through my door, sir  
You may not be one of my possessions  
But I need you more and more  
  
I finally acquired what other people live on  
I always took what I could find  
But on that lucky night  
I found me loving you  
And the best thing you can do  
is to fall in love with  
  
I can feel the glow when we kiss  
I don't have the strength to resist you  
You must have lit a fire in my heart  
'Cause I need you more and more  
  
I'm resting in your arms  
And dancing in the moonlight  
My emotions are on display  
And if I don't see your face  
Or feel you in my fingers  
I would have to try  
To get by with someone like  
  
You relax while I make you warm  
And into your trap I will fall, sir  
I gave my last position  
On the chance to see you more  
To love you more and more  
And more...

I wanna mother you, smother you  
With a love you've never known  
I wanna talk to you  
Say sweet things to you  
  
Let you know that I'm yours alone  
And now you need a lot of loving  
And, my darlin', you need it now  
You've been alone for so long  
You've forgotten what love is all about  
  
Let me rock you in the cradle of my arms  
And let my love protect you from all harm  
I'll be your shelter when you want me to  
I'll be your comfort when you need me to  
  
Mother you, smother you  
With a love that's gentle and true  
I wanna talk to you, say sweet things to you  
And my love will see you through  
  
Put your head on my shoulder  
Put your hand, darling, in mine  
Just let me take you in my arms  
And love away the loneliness you hide  
  
And when life sometimes gets you down  
And you feel the need to cry  
Oh, I'll be standing by your side  
To be your strength and be your guide  
  
I wanna mother you, smother you  
Show me what love is about  
I wanna talk to you, say sweet things to you  
Take away all of your doubt  
  
Just let me mother you, smother you  
With a love you've never known  
I wanna talk to you, say sweet things to you  
Let me know that I'm yours alone  
  
Ooh, mother you, smother you  
With a love that you've never known  
I wanna talk to you, say sweet things to you  
Let me know that I'm yours alone  
  
Mother you, smother you  
With a love

She said she wants a man  
To always understand  
But that's alright for her  
Still it ain't enough for me  
She said she wants a guy  
To keep her satisfied  
But that's alright for her  
But it ain't enough for me  
Still, I don't care if he's young or old  
(Just make him beautiful)  
I just want someone I can hold on to  
I want muscles  
All, all over his body  
(Make him strong enough from his head down to his toes)  
I want muscles  
All, all over his body  
(Make him strong enough from his head down to his toes)  
They say they have to see  
His real personality  
But that's alright for them  
Still it ain't enough for me  
I need what the eyes can see, ah  
(His anatomy)  
If that's alright for them  
Still it ain't enough for me  
I don't care if he's young or old  
Just make him beautiful  
I just want some strong man to hold on to  
I want muscles  
All, all over his body  
(Make him strong enough from his head down to his toes)  
I want muscles  
All over his body  
(Make him strong enough from his head down to his toes)  
Muscle man, I want to love you  
In person, I want your body  
Come with me, hiding the cascades  
Let this be, we've got this thing made  
Lost at sea, hide the desert  
Stay with me, you won't regret it  
Take this love, so deep to swim in  
Come to me, and let the love in  
She said she wants a man  
To always understand  
But that's alright for her  
Still it ain't enough for me  
I don't care if he's young or old  
(Just make him beautiful)  
I just want someone I can hold on to  
I want muscles  
All, all over his body  
(Make him strong enough from his head down to his toes)  
I want muscles  
All over him, all over him  
I want muscles  
All, all over his body  
I want muscles  
I want all I can get  
All over him, all over him  
I want muscles, muscles, muscles

Love is called  
My old piano  
I have a ball  
With my old piano  
  
My baby entertains  
The real life of my parties  
But still retains  
In all the dignity  
His international style  
Exudes an air of royalties  
His eighty eight key smile  
Is so pleasant to see  
  
Love is called  
My old piano  
I have a ball  
With my old piano  
  
[Chorus]  
My old keyboard  
Won't stand for a corner  
He demands the middle of the room  
Your heart dissolves  
While he tips you so gracefully  
Till you're involved  
In a baby grand affair  
  
Love is called  
My old piano  
I have a ball  
With my old piano  
  
He entertains  
The real life of my parties  
But still retains  
In all the dignity  
His international style  
Exudes an air of royalties  
His eighty eight key smile  
Is so pleasant to see  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Love is called  
My old piano  
I have a ball  
With my old piano

This is my place  
And I want to share it with you  
  
I got myself a place to dream  
I touch the wind  
Caress the sea  
And I want you there  
To hold me  
To love me there is to know me  
  
Where the silver bird of tomorrow  
Will fly away with the sorrow  
And time won't pass for you and I  
We'll be standing still  
As the world goes by  
  
This is my place  
And I want to share it with you  
  
I've got the sky to shelter me  
And like the tide I'm moving free  
I've waited here for you only  
We will walk along  
Never lonely  
  
This is my retreat, we're together  
And my place is now even better  
My life's reflected on the sand  
And it shows my love  
When I touch your hand  
  
This is my place  
And I want to share it with you  
I want to share, I want to share it with you  
This is my place  
  
And you know wherever your place is  
Loving only makes it better  
And I want you there to hold me  
To love me there is to know me  
  
Where the silver bird of tomorrow  
Will fly away with the sorrow  
And time won't pass for you and I  
We'll be standing still  
As the world goes round  
  
This is my place  
This is my place  
This is my place
