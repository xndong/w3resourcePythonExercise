Oh, oh, do  
New thoughts  
Will purify my mind  
And clean my body  
New lives  
Will fall together like an endless story  
  
All the love of the universe  
Will be shared by all that's living  
  
And I don't really care  
About tomorrow  
Today  
Is all I really need to find the answers  
  
I'll find the constant flow  
Of all the harmony  
  
Everybody needs a helpin' hand  
Everybody needs a helpin' hand

This is America  
POD and Santana live in La Casa  
Live and direct for you and yours  
Yo America, America  
  
Was it the way that she looked at me  
She had caught my eye  
She stole my heart she freed my mind  
The way we loved it was magical  
Truly wonderful  
It was me and your so beautiful  
  
And I know that you feel this too  
Will our dreams come true  
I believe in you  
Show me the way to my better days  
What's the price to pay  
If I follow you

Well there's nothing I can do  
If you leave me here to cry  
Well there's nothing I can do  
If you leave me here to cry  
You know my love will follow you  
As the years go passing by  
  
I gave you all that I own  
That's one thing you can't deny  
I gave you all that I own  
That's one thing you can't deny  
You know my love will follow you  
As the years go passing by  
  
I'm gonna leave it up to you  
So long,so long good bye  
I'm gonna leave it up to you  
So long,so long good bye  
You know my love will follow you  
As the years go passing by

Shout  
Standing in the doorway  
Beneath the moonlit sky  
An angel stood before me  
And looked me in the eye  
Aye aye  
  
Aye aye aye  
Aye aye aye  
Aye aye aye  
  
She moved up right beside me  
And we began to dance  
The groove was all around us  
The slipped into a trance  
Aye aye  
  
Aye aye aye  
Aye aye aye  
Aye aye aye  
  
Dancing to the rhythm  
Moving to the beat  
Everybody's singing  
You could feel the heat  
Aye aye

Before we go  
I want you to know  
How much I love  
Sharing with you  
All that I have  
And all that I am  
Belongs to you  
All of the time  
  
You been so kind  
And wonderful  
By being here  
So close to me  
Deep in my heart  
I clearly see  
That you and I  
Will soon be free  
  
I'll be standing here  
Waiting on you  
I can hardly wait  
To make you mine (mine, mine)  
It's time to go  
And nothing can stop  
Or even delay  
Our journey's goal  
Remember to be one with you heart  
One with the sky, one with the sea

Took a walk, down by the ocean  
I was alone, nothing on my mind  
As I stood there, I saw the devotion  
That the surf had with the shore  
Suddenly  
I felt this emotion, of the sea  
Pulling me  
  
[Chorus]  
Big Kahuna, tide was high  
I began body surfing for my life  
  
Ecstasy, sky and the sea  
Embracing me  
Golden sun on my face  
Giving life to me  
  
Unafraid I let go  
Trusting in the deep blue sea  
We became one with each other  
Watching the tide as it drifts away  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I spoke to me daddy  
Said to me, son  
You got to go find a job  
And bring some money into the family  
For your mommy and me  
  
I say, Daddy, me want to go to the seashore  
And body surf all day long  
Me no want to work  
Me want to play  
Me want to body surf all day  
Me told him  
Me want to go body surfing  
Me tell him  
Me tell him  
No, me want to go

When you walked out the door, baby  
Thought I would die, I didn't realize  
Oh, you were the brightest star up in the sky, yeah  
Now that you're gone, oh how I miss you so  
Please come back to me, I need your love, baby  
Ever so more, yeah, yeah  
Come back, girl  
Bring your sweet love back to me  
I can't do without it, no, no, no  
If you want, I'll show you what I have  
You can take, take what you want of me  
Just don't take the things, that we know are bad  
Oh baby, oh baby, hey, I need your love, yeah  
Girl oh yeah, oh  
Come back, won't you come back  
Please, oh, please, please, please, please  
Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, please  
I need your love, oh, baby, yeah  

Don't you feel a change a-coming  
From another side of time  
Breaking down the walls of silence  
Lifting shadows from your mind  
Placing back the missing mirrors  
That before you couldn't find  
Filling mysteries of emptiness  
That yesterday left behind.  
  
[Chorus]  
And we all know it's better  
Yesterday has passed  
Now let's all start the living  
For the one that's going to last  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Don't you feel the day is coming  
That will stay and remain  
When your children see  
The answers  
That you saw the same  
When the clouds have all gone  
There will be no more rain  
And all the beauty of all things  
Is uncovered again.  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Don't you feel the day is coming  
And it won't be too soon  
When the people of the world  
Can all live in one room  
When we shake off the ancient  
Chains of our tomb  
We will all be born again  
Of the eternal womb.  
  
[Chorus: x3]

One of these days things gonna change  
One of these days things gonna change  
You'll try not baby  
After while gonna be mine, gonna be mine  
  
One of these days

Cry, crying won't be long, long

I see you walking, a vision of light  
But like an illusion, your beauty fades into the night  
You've got the body, you've got the moves  
You've them oh baby, I know that ain't really you  
If I could get through, get you out of your shell  
It's the heart in you girl  
  
Come to my world  
Where love and your freedom  
Come dance to my rhythm  
The rhythm of love  
Come to my world  
Where you can be real  
And express how you feel  
Cos I know you want to be loved  
  
Something magic about tonight  
Ooh you hide your emotions and wait till the moment is right  
Cos once some music gets in your soul  
Yeah it's just human nature, I know that you'll want to let go  
If I could get through, it's the heart in you girl  
Bring you down to my world  
  
Won't you come in now baby  
The rhythm drives you crazy  
Just pick it up and set it free  
  
Ah oh ah oh, ah oh ah oh

Going back to the memories  
Reminiscing bout you and me  
Thinking how it used to be  
It's plain and clear I treated you bad  
But girl you know that I care  
Every relation (ship) have wear and tear  
Just draw near girl and try to hear and listen what my heart says  
  
Many days and many nights  
Many heartbreaks, many fights  
Many wrongs but so many rights  
So girl don't let this love die  
Never meant to cause you no pain,  
Girl I never meant to treat you lame.  
Gimme one more chance rewind come back again.  
Don't let this love die.  
  
[Chorus]  
Just Cry Baby Cry  
(Don't cry no more)  
Cause every tear that flows falls into the ocean  
And rises to the sky  
And then the rain will come  
Right before the sun shines  
  
Can you feel me reaching out to you girl, can you hear my open thoughts  
Never want (to) disrespect you girl don't let this come break us apart.  
Cause I know I would die without you, my girl can you hear my broken heart.  
It's calling out to the good times that we had back at the start.  
  
Baby (Don't call me baby)  
You know I need you in my life daily. (You know you played me)  
I was a player but now your love changed me. (Dead wrong)  
I'm going crazy (I'm gone)  
Never thought losing you would be so hard  
  
It's your turn to cry baby cry  
(Don't cry no more)  
Cause every tear that flows falls into the ocean  
And rises to the sky  
And then the rain will come  
Right before the sun shines?  
  
So let go  
And move on  
What we were  
Is now undone  
My tears have all dried  
It's your turn now to cry  
  
You're losing your love and your trust for me girl  
And you know, I would go to the ends of the world.  
If you wanted Just like we started.  
Girl cause I don't want to fight no more.  
Make it like it was before.  
  
Chat to her Santana

One way in and one way out  
You don't know what it's all about  
You look to the left  
You look to the right  
The brightest day and the darkest night  
  
[Chorus]  
And if you see me stealin' away  
You better believe that I'd much rather stay  
Daughter of the night  
Everything right  
Is getting to you baby  
Sister of the sun  
Born on the run  
  
Just let me move you baby  
On the road well I been told  
The people need a highway code  
The harder the chase  
The sweeter the catch  
I ain't the driver but you met your match  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You can win and you can lose  
Listen mama you got to choose  
You can give up tryin'  
Or break down cryin'  
Or keep on goin'  
Change your mind  
  
[Chorus]

Freedom, freedom  
Get up stand up, let's celebrate  
Freedom, talking about freedom  
This is the time for redemption  
Freedom, don't you want freedom for everybody  
This is the time for liberation  
Freedom, don't you want freedom for your children  
  
This is the day of celebration  
Let's celebrate, I said let's celebrate, we're gonna celebrate, celebrate, oh
yeah  
Do You Like The Way  
Lauryn Hill  
Versions  
  
Watch the master plan, the pastures span  
Through the streets, move the sheep  
Flipped the beat, like the shepherd  
It's a new day, my crew stay forever striving  
Give thanks cause we alive, and been through the gutter  
Now we see the horizon  
It's clear to me now  
  
Used to be confused, took a lot of years to see how  
Now, we moving planets  
Take the average mind and expand it  
You take for granted like we're always gonna be disadvantaged  
But soon come, it soon come, ya soon done  
Ya start run, you stumble, we catch one  
  
In the rhythm, Santana lick the guits with precision  
Not accidental, intentional conscious decision  
To Zion, we're marching through with African Mayans  
Conquering Babylon with the heart of a lion  
And the walls of Jericho come a-tumbling down  
Tell me, how long has it been  
Is everything, everything alright my friend  
  
You see, time is passing, people asking how come none of this ain't lasting  
Money will make people deal like they don't even have to feel  
But no, it ain't real, it ain't real  
Oh, do you like the way that it's going down  
Do you like the way that it's going down  
Oh, do you like the way  
How long, how long will we wait, to sit down and communicate  
See, everything is relative, if you want to get then give  
Can't we all just build and live,can't we, can't we?  
  
Do you like the way that it's going down  
Do you like the way that it's going down  
Do you like the way that it's going down  
Do you like the way that it's going down

Deeper, Dig Deeper  
  
Deeper, Deeper, dig, dig, Deeper, Deeper  
  
Get a little closer  
You don't have to be afraid  
You have to trust your inner pilot  
Don't let it drift away  
  
Dig a little deeper  
You gotta get it in your soul  
Reach out with your spirit  
And let your feelings show  
  
Deeper, Deeper, dig, dig, Deeper, Deeper  
  
You can't deny the feeling  
That touches you inside  
When you're tired and lonely  
You don't have to lose your pride.  
  
Take the time to listen  
Stay a little while  
Got a song to sing for you  
Let the music get you higher, higher.

The sun is slowly rising  
The day is just beginning  
Let me take you to a  
Place you've never been to  
Imagine that you're walking  
With me in the jungle  
The natives they are dancing  
And singing to a ritual  
  
E papa re, e papa re  
  
The music's getting to you  
Your knees are feeling shaky  
Your mind is getting dizzy  
The spell is taking over  
  
Suddenly you find yourself  
Surrounded by these people  
Ain't no use to try and struggle  
You know it would be useless  
Out of nowhere comes their leader  
Commanding all attention  
He signals them to set you free  
But to keep on singing  
  
E papa re, e papa re  
  
All around below above  
The magic's flowing freely  
Everybody's soaked in sweat  
Drenched by their own feelings  
Incantations cry out loud  
The fire keeps on burning  
Now you're in a time and space  
From where there's no returning

Seems like everybody's waitin'  
For the new change  
Come around, come around,  
Come around, come around  
Waitin' for the day when the king, queen of shows  
Singing, round, singing round, singing round  
Singing round, singing round, singing round for everyone  
Yeah do it  
  
You can understand everything to share  
Let your spirits dance brothers everywhere  
Let your head be free  
Turn the wisdom key  
Find it naturally  
See you're lucky to be  
  
If you're sad just spin around  
And round and round  
Do it  
Yes just hold me baby  
Something on your back  
Lay it down, lay it down, lay it down, lay it down  
Don't you know honey maybe  
You're like my childless hometown  
This ole town, this ole town, this ole town  
  
See it now  
Time for you to all get down  
Yeah do it  
Get ready, get ready, get ready, get ready  
Dig this sound  
Spinnin' round and round and round  
Do it  
You can understand everything's to share  
Let your spirits dance brother everywhere  
Let your head be free  
Turn the wisdom key  
Find it naturally see your lucky to be  
Sing it now  
Time for you to all get down  
Yeah do it  
Get ready, get ready, get ready, get ready  
Get ready, get ready, get ready, get ready

Time for you to all get down

Open your eyes,  
Let it begin with me.  
Brand new day,  
Fresh new way to live,  
The mornin' is callin'  
Walk with me into the sun.  
  
Everything is comin' our way  
Everything is comin' our way.  
Everything is comin' our way.  
  
Here's my hand  
Reaching out to you  
Take it, darlin'  
And lead me on, yeah.  
  
Everything is comin' our way  
Everything is comin' our way  
Everything is comin' our way.  
Ah.  
  
Everything is comin' our way  
Everything is comin' our way  
Everything is comin' our way.  
Ah.  
  
I can feel it in my bones  
No man stands alone.  
Sister, Brother,  
From all the same seed  
  
Everything is comin' our way  
Everything is comin' our way  
Everything is comin' our way.

You've got to change your evil ways, baby  
Before I stop lovin' you  
You've got to change, baby  
And every word that I say is true  
You got me runnin' and hidin' all over town  
You got me sneakin' and a-peepin' and runnin' you down  
This can't go on, Lord knows you got to change, baby  
  
When I come home, baby  
My house is dark and my pots are cold  
You're hangin' round, baby  
With Jean and Joan and-a who knows who  
I'm gettin' tried of waitin' and foolin' around  
I'll find somebody who won't make me feel like a clown  
This can't go on, Lord knows you got to change  
  
When I come home, baby  
My house is dark and my pots are cold  
You're hangin' round, baby  
With Jean and Joan and-a who knows who  
I'm gettin' tried of waitin' and foolin' around  
I'll find somebody who won't make me feel like a clown  
This can't go on, yeah, yeah, yeah

From nowhere  
Through a caravan  
Around the campfire light  
A lovely woman in motion  
With hair as dark as night  
Her eyes were like that  
Of a cat in the dark  
They hypnotize me with love  
  
She was a gypsy woman  
She was a gypsy woman  
  
She danced around and round  
To a guitar melody  
From the fire her face  
Was all aglow  
How she enchanted me  
Oh how I'd like to hold her near  
And kiss and forever whisper in her ear  
  
I love you gypsy woman  
  
All through the caravan  
She was dancing with all the men  
Waiting for the rising sun  
Everyone was having fun  
  
I hate to see the lady go  
Knowing she'll never know  
That I love her  
  
That I love her  
  
She danced around and round  
To a guitar melody  
From the fire her face  
Was all aglow  
How she enchanted me  
Oh how I'd like to hold her near  
And kiss and forever whisper in her ear

Have you ever felt  
That your life is a wasting  
Happiness beyond your reach  
Sweet love has gone astray  
Suddenly it's bitter  
  
Hard times  
Hard times  
  
When you're all alone  
Nothing seems to matter  
Sadness always fills the air  
Hurts so deep inside  
You just have to cry out  
Wow, hard times  
Wow, hard times  
Wow, hard times  
Wow, hard times  
  
Give yourself a chance  
You have something special  
That nobody else can claim  
Deep inside your heart  
Shines a revelation  
Wow, shine on  
Wow, shine on  
Wow, hard times  
Wow, hard times

Don't rush me just this once  
I want to make this moment last  
Slow down the pace, there's no hurry  
I can't let another pass me by again  
Let me be the one to say when I've had enough  
  
Just let me close my eyes, memorize  
The way things are this minute  
So when you're gone I can go on  
If memory can hold on within it what I'm feeling  
Should time try fading or stealing something away  
  
[Chorus]  
Hold on, nothing's the same  
Tell me why I feel this way  
Life wouldn't be worth living without you  
All along I've been the pretender  
But now that's gone forever  
Nobody's ever loved me like you do  
Nobody's broken through  
  
Got to concentrate, file away  
Every last detail  
Don't want to lose what's going down  
I want to remember everything I'm feeling  
Should time try fading or stealing something away  
  
[Chorus: x3]

Is that you  
Your eyes slowly fading?  
Is that you  
Your mind full of tears?  
Is that you  
Searching for a good time?  
Is that you  
Waitin' for all these years?  
  
[Chorus]  
And I hope you're feelin' better  
Yes I hope you're feelin' good  
Yes I hope you're feelin' better  
  
Is that you?  
Look across the ocean  
Is that you  
Thinkin nothin' is really there?  
Is that you  
Waiting for the sunshine?  
Is that you  
When all you see is glare?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Is that you  
Who never saw your baby?  
Is that you  
Who never had a friend?  
Is that you  
Movin' to a new town?  
Is that you  
Will diamonds replace your friends?  
  
[Chorus]

It's so hard just waitin'  
But I guess that's what I have to do  
My poor heart keeps on breakin'  
With every moment I'm away from you  
I know you're smart takin'  
Your time  
'Cause of what it cost you  
Once before  
But it's not then and I love  
You a lot  
Now and forever  
  
[Chorus]  
How long do I wait before you make up your mind  
How long I wonder  
How long before you take away the hardest of times  
How long I wonder  
  
It's unfair when two who care  
Have to face such a perilous sea  
Despair lingers everywhere  
Like a cloud nobody can reach  
I understand you're afraid of it all  
Love is one hell of a step  
I'll be there if you panic or fall  
No matter what the depth  
  
[Chorus]  
  
All I can say I've already said  
More than a thousand times  
It's up to you to believe  
Every word  
Before I lose my mind  
  
[Chorus]

[Chorus]  
I'm the one who loves you  
I'm the one who loves you  
I'm the one who loves you  
I'm the one who loves you  
  
Little girl again you are blue  
Another fellow has gone and left you  
I see you've come back to me  
Your best friend  
To tell another tragic story again  
And once more you look into my eyes  
And one more time you ought to realize  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I must confess you're not to be blamed  
For being caught in those boys' vicious games  
This time I won't let you go back  
Never again, my dear, in fact  
I'm gonna stop the blueness  
In you  
Also confess what my heart  
Wants me to  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Just once more you look in my eyes  
And one more time you ought to realize  
  
[Chorus]

I just gotta get away  
Can't stand it  
Children suffer every day  
  
Tell me baby  
What's it for  
Fighting daily  
For the turf  
  
We're still killing each other  
In the name of the Lord  
There's a brand new graffiti  
With blood on the walls  
  
Peace, are you that far away?  
Now you can feel it  
Other people's pain  
Love can heal it  
Gentle as the rain  
  
Oh, the United Nations drag their feet on the floor  
All they do is spend your money  
They don't tell you what for  
  
Peace, what price we have to pay  
Peace, there's gotta be a better way  
  
People tell me it's useless to look for a way  
I believe that tomorrow starts right here, today  
  
Peace, are you that far away  
Peace, there's gotta be a better way  
  
Peace, are you that far away  
Peace, there's gotta be a better way  
Peace, peace  
There's gotta be a better way  
Peace, peace oh oh oh peace

Clap your hands, make a smile  
Let me know you hear me  
Stay a while, play with me  
Long as you are near me  
Way to go, straight I know  
Love to hear your laughter  
Without a care you are there  
Together ever after  
Me and you coming through  
It's what we got together  
Lay it down, make it work  
No matter what the weather  
We got lot's of soul, lots of love  
Without a thought of giving unselfishly  
You and me all the love we're given  
  
See the light  
Let it shine  
Let it shine  
Down on me  
Feeling good  
Knew I wouould  
Ever since  
You set me free

Are you?  
Are you people get around?  
  
Listen  
Listen to the summer sound  
You're fine  
  
What you need is what you want  
What you need is what you want  
What you need is what you want  
What you need is what you want  
What you need is what you want  
  
Let me  
Let me take you by the hand  
To the  
To the promised wonder land  
  
What you need is what you want  
What you need is what you want  
What you need is what you want

Well, hello, what's your name  
Can I take you by the hand  
Won't you please come with me  
To a place of ecstasy  
Paradise by the sun  
Girl, I'm sure we'll have some fun  
By your eyes I can see  
That you want to be with me  
I've been waiting for so long  
Now that I've found you  
Ain't no way I'm gonna let you go  
  
[Chorus]  
Let me inside  
Open up your heart  
Come on and  
Let me inside  
Open up your heart  
  
Night is clear, moon is bright  
Stars are shining everywhere  
In my arms you'll be safe  
There's no need to be afraid  
It's a warm summer night  
And the temperature is right  
Let your hair hang low  
Girl, I want to feel the flow  
I've been waiting for so long  
Now that I've got you  
Ain't no way I'm gonna let you go  
  
[Chorus]

It's midnight - And I don't want to see you leaving  
Thought of you - going back - back to him - is killing me  
Baby please - how can you torture my heart  
We both know - where we belong  
we belong here in each other's arms  
  
Chorus  
Come with me and we can make the heavens sing  
Can't deny the forces that you feel within  
Come with me and we can make the heavens sing  
"Let me love you tonight"  
"Let me love you tonight"  
  
(if you)  
Go we'll never know - what tomorrow brings  
Got to be a way to end this - suffering  
Come with me and we can make the heavens sing  
"Let me love you tonight"  
"Let me love you tonight"  
  
Baby I - I don't want to see you hurting...(no more)  
Gotta do what's right - 'cause we can't - can't go on  
like this anymore  
I'm on my knees - you know it's over with him  
So why go back - when all that you need  
You know that it's right here with me  
  
Chorus  
Come with me and we can make the heavens sing  
Can't deny the forces that you feel within  
Come with me and we can make the heavens sing  
"Let me love you tonight"  
"Let me love you tonight"  
  
(if you)  
Go We'll never know - what tomorrow brings  
Got to be a way to end this - suffering  
Come with me and we can make the heavens sing  
"Let me love you tonight"  
"Let me love you tonight"

This is truly paradise  
Being here in this celestial garden  
With all the ones you love  
Where nothing dies or ever grows old  
And to be bathed in light  
That cast no shadow  
Yes, this is the kingdom within  
Still you know  
Sometimes I miss seeing and feeling  
The spirits dancing in the flesh  

Lightning in the sky  
Thunder on the ground  
Man and beast alike  
Seeking shelter from the storm  
All around there is fear in the air  
All around there is fear in the air  
  
Burning drops of rain  
Flood my thirsty soul  
Cold chills to the bone  
Glowing eyes filled with pain  
All around there's a cry no one hears  
All around there's a cry no one hears  
  
Always on the run  
Never taking time to see  
Beauty all around  
Nature's dance is just for me  
All around, Nature's dance  
Just for me  
All around, Nature's dance  
Just for me  
  
Rainbows glowing high  
Evening shadows fall  
Don't you wait for me  
I won't be back for your call  
  
I am free from your spell, I am free  
I am free from your spell, I am free  
I am free from your spell, I am free  
Free, free, free  
Free from your spell, I am free

Make somebody happy  
Make somebody happy  
  
Make somebody happy  
Make somebody happy  
  
Love me, love me with all your heart  
And I will, and I will, I will  
I will, I will  
I will take care of you  
  
Make somebody happy  
Make somebody happy  
Make somebody happy  
Make somebody happy  
  
Just you, just having you by my side  
I will, and I will, and I will, I will  
I will, I will  
I will be satisfied  
  
Make somebody happy  
Make somebody happy  
  
Make somebody happy  
Make somebody happy

Oh no no  
oh no no  
  
Verse 1:  
Sometimes I wish I knew your name  
At times I want to say hello  
But you seem so far away  
To let my feelings show  
And though I don't know what to say  
I feel that someday soon one day  
Love will place you by my side  
And it shall be our guide  
  
Chorus:  
And then manana sera se si  
Means our love will always be  
Something special and also true  
Girl I long to be with you  
Oh manana sera se si  
Means our love will always be  
Something special and also true  
Girl I long for you  
  
Verse 2:  
When I have you by my side  
You will always be my pride  
Love so simple yet so sweet  
I do think you're all I need  
So I thought I'd let you know  
That my heart forever grows  
Closer to your warm embrace  
Everytime I see your face  
  
Chorus:  
And then manana sera se si  
Means our love will always be  
Something special and also true  
Girl I long to be with you  
Oh manana sera se si  
Means our love will always be  
Something special and also true  
Girl I long for you  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
And so manana sera se si  
Means our love will always be  
Something special and also true  
Girl I long to be with you  
Oh manana sera se si  
Means our love will always be  
Something special and also true  
Girl I long for you  
  
Bridge:  
Do you know I don't know you  
I want to show you I do love you  
That I do do, do love you  
Oh babe, I think about you  
Even though I don't know you  
I want to show you I do love you  
And that I do do, I think about you  
Oh babe, I do love you  
Even though I don't know you  
I want to show you I do love you  
I think about you  
Oh do do, oh do do, oh do do  
  
Chorus (x2)

Ladies and gents  
Turn up this sound system  
To the sound of Carlos Santana  
And the G-M-B's  
Ghetto blues from the refugee camp  
  
Oh Maria Maria  
She reminds me of a westside story  
Growing up in Spanish Harlem  
She's livin' her life just like a movie star  
Oh, Maria Maria  
She fell in love in East L.A.  
To the sounds of the guitar  
Played by Carlos Santan  
  
Stop the looting, stop the shooting  
Pick pocking on the corner  
See as the rich is getting richer  
The poor is getting poorer  
Se mira Maria on the corner  
Thinkin' of ways to make it better  
In my mailbox there's an eviction letter  
Somebody just said see you later  
  
Ahora vengo mama chola mama chola  
Ahora vengo mama chola (East coast)  
Ahora vengo mama chola mama chola  
Ahora vengo mama chola (West coast)  
  
Oh Maria Maria  
She reminds me of a westside story  
Growing up in Spanish Harlem  
She's livin' her life just like a movie star  
Oh, Maria Maria  
She fell in love in East L.A.  
To the sounds of the guitar  
Played by Carlos Santan  
  
I said a la favella los colores  
The streets are getting hotter  
There is no water  
To put out the fire  
Mi canto la esperanza  
Se mira Maria on the corner  
Thinkin' of ways to make it better  
Then I looked up in the sky  
Hoping of days of paradise  
  
Ahora vengo mama chola mama chola  
Ahora vengo mama chola (North side)  
Ahora vengo mama chola mama chola  
Ahora vengo mama chola (South side)  
Ahora vengo mama chola mama chola  
Ahora vengo mama chola (World wide)  
Ahora vengo mama chola mama chola  
Ahora vengo mama chola (Open up your eyes)  
  
Maria you know your my lover  
When the wind blows I can feel you through the weather  
And even when we are apart  
It feels like we are together  
Maria, yeah  
  
She reminds me of a westside story  
Growing up in Spanish Harlem  
She's livin' her life just like a movie star  
Oh Maria Maria  
She fell in love in East L.A.  
To the sounds of the guitar  
Played by Carlos Santana  
  
Put 'em up y'all  
Carlos Santana with the refugee camp

Yo, Carlos, man you makin' the guitar cry

I am just a mirage  
Oh, I am just a mirage  
When you look at me  
Through your crystal glass you will see  
That I am now your past  
But you give your love to me  
In your life I wasn't meant to be.  
Oh I am just a mirage  
Oh I am just a mirage  
Just a mirage fading away like water  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
I am just a mirage  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
I am just a mirage  
I am just a mirage  
  
But until that day has come  
When you say I'll be your only one  
I will live the way it's meant for me  
With ups and downs and mystery

Got no time for foolin' with you baby  
Your stupid game is about to end.  
You played it out.  
Thought you had it made.  
And it looks like someone passed you by again.  
  
I left her standin' in her corner  
She told me she was tryin' to find her way.  
I've got to leave before I get much older  
Cause she ain't moved in nearly forty days.  
  
I've got a woman that's treatin' me better.  
She takes her time and she ain't so cruel.  
I've got someone to take you over  
Your mother ain't so bad,  
What happened to you?

Move on, there's no time to waste complaining  
Move on, can't you feel your heart expanding  
Every time I turn around  
Ignorance one step behind  
So come on and try again  
You can make it if you try  
  
Move on, there's no time for hesitation  
Move on, all you need is motivation  
Every time I turn around  
Ignorance one step behind  
So come on and try again  
You can make it if you try  
  
Keep on moving on  
Keep on moving  
Got to keep on trying  
Every step of the way  
Got to keep on trying  
Every step of the way

Boom Boom Boom  
Santana's in the room  
Boom Boom Boom  
Mary J's in the room  
Boom Boom Ba-Boom Boom  
Big Boi, Beat Bullies let's ride  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
I got a man and he's so good to me  
I give love and he gives it back to me  
Say it for me once if you know what I mean  
I said my man's what a man's supposed to be  
  
[Mary]  
He opens his arms and holds on to me  
He tells me he loves me and oh I feel it  
And all that I am and all that I'll be  
Is there in his eyes when I hear him sayin' please  
  
Who loves you baby?  
  
I do, I do trust you  
See see this ain't just bout having sex  
I don't even have to touch you  
But you lustful I'm buggin'  
You feel me bulgin' while we huggin'  
We all over one another (scattered, covered, smothered)  
You're my choosey lover  
Never loving others only rubbing me (me)  
Satisfy Big to the utmost mentally and physically (ly)  
Every king must crown a queen to make his kingdom mean anything  
Through thick and slim we gon' win we a team by any means y'all  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
The touch of his hand the sound of his voice  
The way that he loves me till he knows I feel it  
And all through the night forever rejoice  
The angel above me starts to sweetly sing to me  
  
Who loves you baby?  
  
I do, I do adore you  
I'm the best man for the job  
Another man couldn't do nothing for you  
Cause you're spicy just like me  
We come together like thunder and lightning  
With all of that scratching and biting  
So exciting it's frightening  
I'm your do-right man and you're my do right not my just for tonight woman  
Making me feel just like a baker quick to put something in your oven  
Not no dumplin's or no stuffin' but our own lil' flesh and blood'n  
A bouncin' lil' baby something pretty girl or handsome son child  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
My man's what a man's supposed to be  
I got a man

Drunk all the whiskey  
But I still can't get no rest  
Brain trapped on a roller coaster  
Got a pain in my chest  
Cold water on my eyeballs  
Send a shiver up my spine  
Hit the street in the wee wee hours  
This is the night hunting time  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't know what I'm doing here  
Don't know what I'm doing here  
Got to get my senses clear  
  
Stumble in off the footpath  
Heard the sounds from below  
Get accustomed to the darkness  
Got to take it real slow  
Sweat streamin' down my cheekbones  
Smoke stingin' my eyes  
Walls drippin' like the jungle  
But this ain't no paradise  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Stumble up to the counter  
Catch the tension in the air  
Black Sabbath drive a young boy crazy  
This ain't no frivolous affair  
Young girl sipping Pernod  
Budy hunger in her glance  
No stoppin' when it comes to doin'  
The Heavy Metal Romance  
  
[Chorus]

No One To Depend On  
  
Ain't got nobody that I can depend on  
Ain't got nobody that I can depend on  
  
Ain't got nobody that I can depend on  
  
Ain't got no one tengo anadie  
That I know of no tengo anadie  
That I can depend on no tengo anadie  
Ain't got no one  
  
Got nobody  
That I can depend on no tengo anadie  
Ain't got nobody that I can depend on  
No tengo anadie.  
  
No One To Depend On

I am a victim of my time  
A produce of my age  
There's no choosing my direction  
I was a holy man but now  
With all my trials behind me  
I am weak in my conviction  
  
And so I walk to try to get away  
Knowing that someday  
I will finally have to face  
The fear that will come from knowing that  
The one thing I had left was you  
And now you're gone  
  
You were a victim of my crimes  
A product of my rage  
You were a beautiful distraction  
I kept you locked away outside  
Let misery provide  
And now I am ashamed  
  
And so I walk to try to find a space  
Where I can be alone to live with my mistakes  
And the fear that will come  
From knowing that the one thing  
I had left was you  
And now you're gone

I've been searching for freedom  
I've been looking for someone  
In the dreams of my heart, I see your face  
Calling me into the light  
  
You're the vision of beauty  
You're so radiant and lovely  
I just can't believe you're here with me  
Your touch is my ecstasy, my love  
  
Looking into the future  
We can see the beginning  
Children living in peace and harmony  
That is the way it will be

Night ain't a friend  
It's black and so still  
It waits like a cat  
Then moves in for the kill  
It casts its shadows high on the wall  
It's givin' me no peace at all  
Now you're gone  
The pain goes on  
You're so deep into me  
Now I'm begging you to  
Set me free  
  
[Chorus]  
I've got nowhere to run  
Nowhere to hide  
No way to stop  
This hurt deep inside  
That you gave to me  
Nowhere to run  
Nowhere to run  
Nowhere to run  
  
The sound of your voice  
It comes in the night  
It stays with me there  
Until the light  
When you say the words  
That you said before  
  
When you said you'd stay  
You walked out the door  
I can take the afternoon  
But then comes the night  
Instead I walk the floor  
Till the light  
  
[Chorus: x2]

Just because in a moment of madness  
I took advantage of your sweet love  
Don't just hand me a lifetime of sadness  
'Cause there's so little of beauty  
  
Oh baby, one chain don't make no prison  
Two wrongs don't make no right  
One rain don't make no river  
One punch don't make no fight  
  
Can't you spare me a little affection  
Would that be asking too much of you  
Don't point love in another direction  
I swear I'll make it all up to you  
  
Oh baby, one chain don't make no prison  
Two wrongs don't make no right  
One rain don't make no river  
One punch don't make no fight  
  
There's a bed I'm keeping room in for you  
There's a lot I know I gotta do  
Don't let as simple misunderstanding  
Be a mountain that we can't move  
  
Oh, one chain don't make no prison  
Two wrongs don't make no right  
One rain don't make no river  
One punch don't make no fight  
  
One chain don't make no prison  
Two wrongs don't make no right  
One rain don't make no river  
One punch don't make no fight

You in time with music of the universe  
Doctor of mother earth  
We are all one  
We are all one with the sun  
  
Reflecting words to say  
Silently I want to be  
With symphonies of stars  
You came singing through my soul  
I see you in the golden sunset  
Glowing through my soul  
We are all one with the sun  
  
In the summertime we went to the sea  
How smooth plate how calm against  
These skies dancing in your eyes.

You be you and let me be me  
No strings attached emotionally  
I want to get a little crazy  
That's puttin' it plain  
You got the medicine and I got the pain.  
  
When you just want to feel good  
Like the doctor said  
One good dose of loving  
It's gonna straighten out your head  
  
You got an open invitation  
On that you can rely  
You got a prepaid reservation  
And that's the only way to fly.  
  
Let's make love, the feeling is right  
Just passing by like ships in the night  
Oughta get a little friendly  
There's no time like now  
You bring the attitude and I'll show you how.  
  
Anytime you're ready  
Anytime at all  
Just come on over  
Don't even have to call.

Watcha gonna do with your life  
Now that I'm leaving  
Are you believing  
You'll make it on your own  
  
Didn't you believe what I said  
Or was it just madness  
Living in sadness  
You'll be all alone  
  
I said it over and over  
At least a hundred times  
I have what you been missing  
Look back and you may find  
  
Now it's time to walk out the door  
It's all been said now  
I'm looking ahead now  
Time to be moving on  
Yes, I told you so many times  
But you didn't listen  
You can't see what you're missing  
What you never had before  
  
I could have loved you  
Like there was no tomorrow  
It didn't really matter  
If you stole my love or borrowed  
You know I could go crazy  
But I just can't remember  
Exactly how to go there  
And keep this love forever

You got persuasion  
I can't help myself  
You got persuasion  
I can't help myself  
Something about you baby  
Keeps me from goin' to somebody else  
  
Yeah, any way you want  
Now, now baby  
You put me in a daze  
All the time  
Look what cha got for me baby  
Like the devil in disguise  
  
Something about you baby  
You're one  
You're one of a kind  
  
Oh this spell you put on me  
Has just outdone me babe  
I can't keep the rain from comin' down  
  
Look out now  
I can't get out from under  
But I wouldn't want to  
Even if I can  
  
Something about you baby  
Make me feel  
Make me feel like a man

Let me begin by telling you  
Something that happened turned my head around  
I took a walk on a cloudy day  
I met a friend, this is what he said  
  
Now is the time for change  
I'm trying to get to a higher place  
Life is surrounded by grace  
Let's join together singing songs of freedom  
  
What do you do when you gain the world  
You pay the price, baby, you lose your soul  
Live in a world of make believe  
It won't work, baby, can't you see?  
  
Now is the time for change  
I'm trying to get to a higher place  
Life is surrounded by grace  
Let's join together singing songs of freedom  
  
Praise  
Praise  
  
It's three o' clock in the mornin'  
When I'm all by myself  
And I feel the spirit comin' on again  
  
Now is the time for change  
I'm trying to get to a higher place  
Life is surrounded by grace  
Let's join together singing songs of freedom

If a world divides  
From the bittersweetness love provides  
I will redefine my place within this union  
If a word is a lie  
And the better me can't show its side  
I will try to find my way to higher ground  
  
Oh, there's a million stories  
And a million ways to get there from here  
  
Baby, I'm gonna put your skin on mine  
Be inside you all my life  
And if you let your heart open up your mind  
There's a whole new world on the other side  
I'm gonna be your satellite  
I'll hang over your world at night  
And I can hear you sleep beneath the candlelight  
I can see your dreams like they were mine  
  
When I, I hear you scream, I hear you cry  
It makes me realize that I am only human  
If the world relies on the balance between love and pride  
Then I'll abandon all my pride and bring you love  
  
Oh, there's a million reasons  
And a million ways to get to your heart  
  
Baby, I'm gonna make you step outside  
The corners of your world and find  
That if you let your heart open up your mind  
There's a whole new world on the other side  
I'm gonna be your satellite  
I'll hang over your world at night  
And I can hear you sleep beneath the candlelight  
I can see your dreams like they were mine  
  
Baby, I'm gonna put your skin on mine  
Be inside you all my life  
And if you let your heart open up your mind  
There's a whole new world on the other side  
I'm gonna be your satellite  
I'll hang over your world at night  
And I can hear you sleep beneath the candlelight  
I can see your dreams like they were mine

It gives me such a thrill  
When you tell me 'bout the way  
You feel  
It really makes my day  
I just love to hear you say  
  
[Chorus]  
Say it again, say it high say it low  
Say it again, so the whole wide  
World will know  
Say it, that you're still loving me  
Still loving me, still in love with me  
Say it again, tell me where, tell me when  
  
Say it again, that our love will never end  
Say it, that you're still loving me  
Still loving me, still in love with me  
  
You know it sounds so sweet  
It just knocks me right up off of  
My feet  
To hear you talk that way  
I just love to hear you say  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I hear the echoes in my mind  
They're calling to me all the time  
I hear those voices start to sing  
Again and again  
  
It gives me such a thrill  
When you tell me 'bout the way  
You feel  
It really makes my day  
I just love to hear you say  
  
[Chorus]

Searchin', I'm always searchin'  
Searchin' for my beloved  
I'm gonna keep on searchin' 'cause  
I need your love, yea  
Listen, my heart is callin'  
Longing to have you near me  
Please believe me what I'm sayin' is true  
Every morning I wake up to you  
Searchin', searchin', searchin', searchin'  
Every night my thoughts return to calling you  
Lover, don't keep me waiting  
You must hear what I'm saying  
I'm gonna keep on searchin' till I win your love  
I can almost hear her gentle voice  
Searchin', searchin', searchin', searchin'  
I can almost hear her smile of light  
Searchin', searchin', searchin', searchin'  
I can almost feel the love reach out to me

She has the innocence and vision of a child  
How can I ever really know her?  
We're riding on a carousel  
That's running wild  
Around in circles 'til it's over  
  
And every time we reach the end  
We go around again 'cause  
  
[Chorus]  
She can't let go  
And I don't want to tell her no  
She can't let go  
And I don't want to tell her no  
  
I see her starin' out the window at the rain  
But she will never leave the fire  
Sometimes it burns all night and covers up the pain  
Sometimes it only leaves us tired  
  
And every time we reach the end  
We go around again 'cause  
  
[Chorus]

No one told me about her  
The way she lied  
Well, no one told me about her  
How many people cried  
  
Well, it's too late to say you're sorry  
How would I know, why should I care  
Please don't bother trying to find her  
She's not there, oh oh oh  
  
Nobody told me about her  
What could I do  
Well, nobody told me about her  
Though they all knew  
  
Well, it's too late to say you're sorry  
How would I know, why should I care  
Please don't bother trying to find her  
She's not there  
  
Well, let me tell you about the way she looked  
The way she acted, the color of her hair  
Her voice is soft and cool  
Her eyes are clear and bright  
But she's not there

Since Supernatural ain't nothin' changed  
All new players still the same old game  
Well if you're low-ridin' or your up in your range  
Let me see you blow your horn  
  
For the mommies that be lookin' good at he bus stop  
The ones at the club that be makin' the fires start  
Your fools with the thugs that be makin' the guns spark  
Why can't we all just get along?  
  
LAPD, riots, beating  
Streets on fire, people fleeting  
Someone said there's O.J. speeding  
Cochran beef in that club ain't fittin'  
  
Tyson's fight, Vegas lights  
Tupac lost his life that night  
And Biggie dies  
And hip-hop prize  
And that's when the East and the West unite  
So, come on

Somewhere  
In heaven  
There is a place  
Waiting for you and me  
  
He made a promise  
Gave every drop of Blood  
Died on the cross  
so we'd be free.  
  
Oh Oh Oh Oh  
  
Somewhere, Somewhere  
In Heaven  
There's a place  
Waiting, waiting for you and me  
  
He made a promise  
Gave every drop of Blood  
And died on the cross  
So we'd be free.  
  
Somewhere, Somewhere  
In Heaven  
There is a place  
Waiting, waiting for you and me  
  
He made a promise  
When He gave every drop of His blood  
Died on the cross  
So we'd be free.

Everybody tells me, we love your songs  
Your soul is precious, but it just ain't good enough  
You need a single to help you through  
Program directors, they all make the rules  
I said, you're kidding, you're putting me on  
What about the Constitution, freedom of expression  
Listen to the music, just feel the sound  
Love is the motion, that's what makes the world go around  
  
[Chorus]  
Sing, Songs of Freedom  
Bring joy to the world  
Sing, Songs of Freedom  
Bring joy to the world  
  
Everybody listen, stop and take some time  
To understand the world situation  
There is no meaning in fighting the way we do  
Let's come together and forgive each other  
  
[Chorus]

One day you're up, next day  
You're down  
Where does it end  
War in the east, war in the south  
No one can win  
  
Hunger and strife taking the lives  
Brothers and friends  
Young people grow, way much  
Too fast  
To realize  
  
[Chorus]  
That the spirit brightens up  
The sun  
Everything in life must be as one  
  
Nations collide, defending  
Their pride  
Blood is the price  
The price is too high, no need  
To die  
Let's turn it around  
Let's change the face, the  
Human race  
Progress will come  
Just take the time, look deep  
Inside  
We'll understand  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Can't you feel the spirit  
Grow into the light  
Can't you see the spirit  
Glowing in the night

Love brings a change  
I want to take a chance  
And let it grow  
I trust my feelings  
I want to be with you  
Wherever you go  
  
Oh baby  
We're more than friends  
So precious it should never end  
Oh baby  
Can't help but win  
  
Stand up, say it loud  
What we need is a lot more love  
Stand up, say it loud  
What we need is a lotta good good love  
  
Tonight is our turn  
We have the opportunity  
Don't be afraid  
Want to make you happy  
Satisfy the dreams inside our heads  
  
Ooh daylight comes around so fast  
I want to make this evening last  
Ooh baby, I've given my best  
  
Stand up, say it loud  
What we need is a lotta love  
Stand up, shout it out  
What we need is a lot more love  
  
Ooh baby, new dreams to share  
And someone that will truly care  
If you're lonely  
I will always be there  
  
Stand up, say it loud  
What we need is a lot more love  
Stand up, shout it out  
What we need is a lotta good good love

Stay  
Beside me  
Don't go away  
Cause if you leave me I will lose my inspiration  
I don't want to be another victim of frustration  
  
Stay  
Please guide me  
I need your love  
That I may see  
Below, above, and all around is all confusion  
You're the only one that breaks the spell of all illusion  
  
Take me  
I belong to only you  
Your love  
Coming down like a gentle rain  
To soothe my pain  
Gently  
Oh, won't you stay  
  
Below, above, and all around is all confusion  
You're the only one that breaks the spell of all illusion  
Take me  
I belong to only you  
Your love  
Coming down like a gentle rain  
To soothe my pain  
Gently  
Oh, won't you stay

What's that sound I hear coming from the ground  
That' going 'round and 'round I can feel it pull me down  
On my knees tears of joy have come to me  
As the flower sounds made it plain to see  
  
That this world is a perfect place to live  
There is a warm soft wind blowing 'round me just to give  
All the leaves such a haunting melody  
That forever will be a part of me  
  
Just like a ship out on the sea  
Floating alone no one around me or beyond me  
The sun is on me  
  
Then suddenly I felt a kiss out of the breeze  
That did caress me and possess me  
Oh it astounds me  
  
All around there's a feeling in the air  
That with the grace of time we'll be getting closer there  
But day by day I can see they walk away  
And I wonder, Lord will they ever know  
  
That this world is a perfect place to live?  
Just look into your heart, find the love that's there to give  
Realize that the secret is to share

You are the sunshine, baby, whenever you smile  
But I call you Stormy today  
All of a sudden that ol' rain is fallin' down  
And my world is cloudy and gray  
You've gone away  
  
Old Stormy Stormy  
Old Stormy Stormy  
Old Stormy Stormy  
Old Stormy Stormy  
  
Yesterday's love was alive, the warm summer breeze  
But like the weather you changed  
Now things are dreary, baby, windy and cold  
And I stand alone in the rain  
Callin' out your name  
  
Stormy Stormy  
Stormy Stormy  
Come back to me Stormy  
Stormy Stormy  
  
Bring back that sunny day  
  
Yesterday's love was alive, the warm summer breeze  
But like the weather you changed  
Now things are dreary, baby, windy and cold  
And I stand alone in the rain  
Callin' out your name  
  
Whoa! Stormy  
  
Stormy, come back to me Stormy  
Stormy, come back to me Stormy  
  
Come on home! Stormy  
  
Bring back that sunny day

Loving you this way  
Has made my tired heart sing  
Lady, you touch my soul  
With all the love you bring  
  
Being so close to you  
Is where I want to be  
Don't turn your smile away  
Don't break my fantasy  
  
Summer lady  
You look good to me  
Summer lady  
You're my fantasy  
  
Seeing your presence near  
Every time I wake  
My life would be incomplete  
If I didn't have you there  
  
Summer lady  
You look good to me  
Summer lady  
You're my fantasy  
  
Laying here in my room  
With all my worldly things  
Don't make up for all my dreams  
Of you in my fantasy  
  
Summer lady  
You look good to me  
Summer lady  
You're my fantasy  
Summer lady  
You look good to me  
Summer lady  
You're my fantasy  
Please don't take my dreams away  
Oh, summer lady

I lay not sleeping  
Don't know what to do  
Lay out in waiting  
Lord for the noon  
  
Pass so slowly  
Time without you  
I can't see why  
My open eyes can't see  
  
So much to look by  
So many things to be  
Can't keep looking  
In and out of me  
She looks at nothing  
Someone you all have seen  
She never cried  
As I watched her leave  
  
Try to help me  
Find the change in me  
Oh, oh, oh  
  
Try to help me  
Find the change in me  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

What do you do when you're down and out  
Do you sit and sigh and wonder why  
If the answer just comes right to you  
It's letting you know just what to do  
  
Oh, your lady's tired of you running around  
And if you don't stop she'll put you down  
Says she's got some good to give  
All of her love and affection here  
All you got to do is stop running around  
  
Tell me, are you tired  
Tell me, are you tired runnin' around  
Tell me, are you tired running around  
  
Tell me, are you tired  
Tell me, are you tired playin' round town  
Tell me, are you tired  
Tell me, are you tired gettin' down on the town  
  
Stay at home, stay at home  
Stay at home, stay at home  
  
Lady says she needs your love  
It just can't come from up above  
She doesn't want to be by herself  
Says she wants you and no one else  
  
Knows you bring home the bread  
That's half the plan, stay and hold her hand  
You being home is surely missed  
All she wants is you to hug and kiss  
  
All you got to do is start stay at home  
  
Tell me, are you tired  
Tell me, are you tired runnin' around  
Tell me, are you tired  
Tell me, are you tired runnin' around town  
  
Tell me, are you tired  
Tell me, are you tired playin' around town, town  
Tell me, are you tired  
Tell me, are you tired gettin' down on the town  
  
Stay at home, stay at home  
Stay at home, stay at home  
Stay at home, stay at home  
Stay at home, stay at home  
  
Stay at home, stay at home  
Stay at home, stay at home  
Stay at home, stay at home  
Stay at home, stay at home

You know they say that one hand washes the other  
Well you better start, better start looking out for me  
'Cause there's a way that you can be minus one lover  
Just keep making it hard deliberately  
  
If you're gonna play with fire don't cry when you burn your fingers  
I'm not going to be the fool that you get tired of  
Someone's got to clean up their act before the show is over  
Baby such are the facts of love  
  
It's been so long since we made magic together  
But you never stopped taking real good care of yourself  
There comes a time you see your face in the mirror  
And something tells you the pain ain't good for your health no no  
  
If you're gonna play with fire don't cry when you burn your fingers  
I'm not going to be the fool that you get tired of  
Someone's got to clean up their act before the show is over  
Baby such are the facts of love, ooh  
  
If you gonna play with fire don't cry when you burn your fingers  
I'm not going to be the fool that you get tired of  
Somebody's got to clean up their act before the show is over  
Baby such are the facts, the facts of love, the facts of love, the facts of
love

Tell me  
Just what you want me to be  
One kiss  
And boom you're the only one for me  
So please tell me  
Why don't you come around no more?  
Cause right now  
I'm crying outside the door of your candy store  
  
It just takes a little bit of this, a little bit of that  
It started with a kiss  
Now we're up to bat  
A little bit of laughs, a little bit of pain  
I'm telling you my babe  
It's all in the game of?  
  
Love is  
Whatever you make it to be  
Sunshine  
Instead of this cold lonely sea  
So please baby  
Try and use me for what I'm good for  
It ain't saying goodbye  
It's knocking down the door of your candy store  
  
It just takes a little bit of this, a little bit of that  
It started with a kiss  
Now we're up to bat  
A little bit of laughs, a little bit of pain  
I'm telling you my babe  
It's all in the game of love  
It's all in this game of love  
  
You roll me  
Control me  
Console me  
Please hold me  
You guide me  
Divide me  
Into me  
  
So please tell me  
Why don't you come around no more?  
Cause right now  
I'm dying outside the door of your loving store  
  
It just take a little bit of this, a little bit of that  
It started with a kiss  
Now we're up to bat  
A little bit of laughs, a little bit of pain  
I'm telling you my babe  
It's all in the game of love  
It's all in the game of love  
It's all in this game of love  
Let's play the game of love  
  
Roll me  
Console me  
Please hold me  
I'm out here on my own  
On my own

You are my river  
Keep on flowing through  
Filling my life  
With all of you  
  
You are the freedom  
I've been searching for  
Oh how I love you  
Just for who you are  
  
There will be hard times  
Everyone must go through  
Testing his love  
Just to see if it's true  
But the hard times will come  
But they all pass away  
I have seen the light  
In my life today  
  
That's why I love you  
Just for who you are  
  
You are my river.

Where's my pal, where's my friend  
All good things must have an end  
Sad things and nothings  
On and on they go  
I guess he went to Mexico  
  
Chorus:  
They all went to Mexico  
Buenas dias, got to go  
Tengo que obedecer  
Mi corazon  
They all went to Mexico  
Where's my mule, where's my dray  
Straw hat's packed up and gone  
away  
Mule don't go north and dray go slow  
They both went to Mexico  
Where's my sweetie, where's the face  
That lit dark corners every place  
She put up with me long time you know  
And then she had to go to Mexico  
  
Chorus  
  
where's my brown dog, where's my hound  
He liked my truck he hung around  
But he's a canine romeo  
And I guess he went to Mexico  
Where's that woman so sweet, so mean  
Her heart was cautious her mind was keen  
She was always looking for the peccadillo  
I hope she went to Mexico  
  
Chorus  
  
Where's December's happy crew  
With German bikes and sidecars too  
They take the truck south to St. Louis, MO  
Motorcycle all the way to Mexico  
Where's my luck, where's my grace  
Has it all been just a foolish chase  
Every time I hear that rainy chill wind blow  
I think it might be time to head to Mexico

I believe in never let my strip get hotter  
Than something I can get out of  
One that heats up on me  
I told 'em this would be a once time dance  
Meaning one time chance  
After I said that, oh  
That's when he got close to me  
All the other music stopped but the violin  
Conversation, one dance, sip a bottle of the best  
Now I'm asking myself "what has he done to me?"  
  
This can't turn into love, no  
The rose petals were all in the air  
Just might need that firetruck  
To come and get me  
  
[Chorus:]  
Dip me in water  
'Cause this boy's fire  
It's got a hold of me  
Can't say I don't want it  
'Cause he really put it on me  
In a way that I don't know  
If I'm going or coming  
Dip me in water  
'Cause this boy's fire  
It's got a hold of me  
Didn't have to know from your body  
Put it on me  
Not just physically but mentally, andale, on me  
  
Gotta call a cab  
If I don't need gonna have me  
With every young stunna' in the hood wanna have me  
Uh, so much of him I couldn't surrender  
'Cause I know where this could end up  
And with that right now I can't play  
I know I drive him loco  
But that's just the way  
You make a mama's hips go  
  
This can't turn into love, no  
The rose petals were all in the air  
Just might need that firetruck  
To come and get me  
  
[Chorus]

[Chorus]  
Try a little harder now  
Try a little harder now  
Try a little harder now  
Try a little harder now  
  
No one ever said it would be easy  
Doin' whatever you do  
You just might have to suffer  
But keep on movin' right through  
You've got to  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Sometimes you have to change your tune  
To get where you want to be  
But don't you let that satisfy you  
You can have all you see  
  
[Chorus]

You, always making promises  
Who gets the blame for your mistakes  
You, made a game of politics  
Now fear and guilt on your face  
  
But I can't feel your pain  
And I won't share your shame  
All I know is what I feel  
Music sets me free  
  
I don't mind walking in the rain  
Ooh, tears of heaven soothe my pain  
Love is the sound that makes me sing  
I love to play a melody  
  
But you can't hear the sound  
But you can't, you can't feel the beat  
All I know is what I feel  
Music sets me free  
  
I don't mind walking in the rain  
Ooh, tears of heaven soothe my pain  
Love is the sound that makes me sing  
I love to play a melody  
  
But you can't hear the sound  
But you can't, you can't feel the beat  
All I know is what I feel  
Music sets me free  
  
Two points of view  
Two points of view  
Two points of view  
One for me, and one for you  
  
But you can't hear the sound  
But you can't, you can't feel the beat  
All I know is what I feel  
Music sets me free  
  
Two points of view  
Two points of view  
Two points of view  
One for me and one for you  
  
Two points of view  
Two points of view

Come on, baby, don't you wanna go  
Way down south, talkin' ?bout Mexico  
Straight through the jungle, out to the sea  
We'll have some fun if you fly away with me  
Like some old movie in black and white  
We'll fall in love in the middle of the night  
Me and you, down in Veracruz  
Do what you wanna do, down in Veracruz  
Come on, baby, don't you wanna come  
In the town, people movin' to the drums  
Let me tell ya that  
Rosa's Cantina, it never stops  
Drinkin' cerveza, people party ?til they drop  
Forget the laundry, forget the rain  
We'll get to heaven on the seven thirty plane  
Me and you, down in Veracruz  
Do what you wanna do, down in Veracruz  
In [Incomprehensible], it never stops  
You wanna party? We can party 'til we drop  
Forget the laundry, forget the rain  
Got to get to heaven on the seven thirty plane  
Me and you, down in Veracruz  
Do what you wanna do, down in Veracruz  
Me and you, down in Veracruz  
Do what you wanna do, down in Veracruz  
Me and you  
Down in Veracruz  
Down in Veracruz  

Here I am, once again  
This time, babe, I'm gonna do it right  
Mind's made up, heart is set  
Ain't no way I'm gonna compromise  
  
Something happened, Hollywood skies  
I was mesmerized  
Suits and ties with platinum eyes  
Cold cash junkies got the best of me  
  
Victim of circumstance  
  
Got myself back together  
Learned my lesson well  
I had to put up a fight, to make it right  
Freedom's ringing like the sound of a bell  
  
Victim of circumstance  
  
One more thing I want to say to you  
Before you go away  
Don't you let 'em, no!  
Don't you let 'em, no!

You better take it easy baby  
Before you go away  
You did me dirty  
You'll get yours one day  
  
Chorus:  
You better  
Watch your step...  
Talkin' about you  
Watch your step...  
You better  
Watch your step...  
  
Keep your eyes open wide  
'Cause you'll be hurtin' down inside  
  
You better leave me all your money  
Before you go away  
Don't think I'm funny honey  
All I've got to say  
  
Chorus  
  
'Cause when you took your love  
from me  
You left me full of misery  
I'm gonna be all right  
  
Chorus  
  
When you need me by your side  
I'm gonna say go somewhere and hide  
Watch your step...  
You better watch out baby  
everything you do  
I'm gonna keep my eyes focused,  
right on you  
You better walk right baby  
There's just one thing I know  
You better watch your step...  
When you need me by your side  
I'm gonna say go somewhere and hide

Well, All Right  
Petty, Alison, Holly, Mauldin  
  
Well, all right so I'm being foolish  
Well, all right let people know  
About the dreams and wishes you wish  
In the night when the lights are low  
  
Well, all right, well all right  
We'll live and love with all our might  
Well, all right, well all right  
Our lifetime love will be all right  
  
Well, all right, so I'm going steady  
It's all right when people say  
That those foolish kids can't be ready  
For the love that comes their way  
  
Well, all right, well all right  
We'll live and love with all our might  
Well, all right, well all right  
Our lifetime love will be all right  
Repeat last verse

When I look into your eyes  
I see the ocean in the shore  
And I know just what I'm living for  
When I look into your eyes, yeah  
When I look into your eyes  
All the love there is arrives  
And everything around me dies  
When I look into your eyes, yeah, yeah, yeah  
When I look into your eyes  
The sun melts deep into the sky  
And plants a seed inside my soul  
And takes me up into the sky  
When I look into your eyes  
I see the oceans in the shore  
And I know just what I'm living for  
When I look into your eyes, yeah, yeah  

Who's that lady (who's that lady)  
Beautiful lady (who's that lady)  
Lovely lady (who's that lady)  
Real fine lady  
  
Hear me calling out to you  
'Cause that's all that I can do  
Your eyes tell me to pursue  
But you say look, yea, but don't touch baby!  
No, no, no don't touch  
  
Who's that lady (who's that lady)  
Sexy lady (who's that lady)  
Beautiful lady (who's that lady)  
Real fine lady  
  
I would dance upon a string  
Any gifts she'd want I'd bring  
I would giver her anything  
If she would just do what I say  
  
Come 'round my way baby  
Shine my way  
  
Who's that lady  
Beautiful lady  
Lovely lady  
Real real fine lady  
  
I would love to take her home  
But her heart is made of stone  
But I'll keep on keepin' on  
If I don't she'll do me wrong  
Do me wrong  
  
(Look yeah, but don't touch  
Just do what I say  
Don't, she'll do me wrong)

What shall we do with the dreams  
Who see a world we can never know  
Who have found a place of wonder  
Where only children dare to go  
What shall we do with the dreams  
Whose world has no room for hate  
Whose vision of tomorrows promise  
Is so far removed from our fate  
For they dream of a thousand tomorrows  
Each one better than the one before  
A future filled with compassion  
For the tired, the weak, the hungry and the poor  
What shall we do with the dreamers  
Who no longer answer when we ask why  
Who work to make their world better  
And are unafraid to try  
What shall we say to the dreamers  
Whose lives make ours seem so bare  
Who make us feel so empty  
Because they dare to care  
For they dream not of thing done before  
But of the miracles which lie ahead  
Of the needy who can be assisted  
And the famished who can be fed  
What shall we make of the dreamers  
When they choose not to live as we  
When they say our world has no meaning  
As long as others are still not free  
What shall we think of the dreamers  
When they no longer listen to what we say  
When their silence leaves us uneasy  
And they refuse to go away  
For they dream of fanciful figures  
Poised in mid flight  
Angels with wings of grace  
Floating on the light  
Messengers from the next world  
So unfamiliar but yet not strange  
Bringing word of the new world  
The beginning of the change  

One day I was on the ground  
When I needed a hand  
Then it couldn't be found  
I was so far down that I couldn't get up  
You know and one day I was one of life's losers  
Even my friends were my accusers  
In my head I lost before I begun  
  
I had a dream but it turned to dust  
And what I thought was love  
That must have been lust  
I was living in style  
When the walls fell in  
And when I played my hand  
I looked like a joker  
Turn around fate must have woke her  
Cause lady luck she was waiting outside the door  
  
I'm winning  
I'm winning  
I'm winning  
I'm winning and I don't intend losing again  
  
Too bad it belonged to me  
It was the wrong time and not meant to be  
It took a long time and I'm new born now  
I can see the day that I bleed for  
If it's agreed that there's a need  
To play the game and to win again

Yesterday, I was alone and blue  
My heart was heavy and then came you  
Oh, I can see! That you were meant for me  
Now, I have found you, I'll never let you go  
You know that I love you, I need you  
You know that I'm caring, sharing everything I've got  
Don't you know that I want you? I need you too  
I will be happy with you for the rest of my life  
Many lovers they come and go  
But your sweet loving lingers on and on  
Oh, I can feel! That this time it's for real  
So, hold me closer and never let me go  
You know that I love you, I need you  
You know that I'm caring, sharing everything I've got  
Don't you know that I want you? I need you too  
I will be happy with you for the rest of my life  
I will be happy with you for the rest of my life  
Well your sweet love is all I need  
Without you I just can't go on  
You know that I love you, I need you too  
You know that I'm caring, sharing everything I've got  
Don't you know that I want you? I need you too  
I will be happy with you for the rest of my life  
I'll be happy with you for the rest of my life  
I will be happy with you for the rest of my life  

Yours is the light that will always shine  
And shine eternally, eternally  
Mine is the search, never ending search  
Until I am with you  
For you, fill my life  
All my days and nights  
With memories of you  
Yours is the light that will always shine  
And shine eternally  
Mine is the search, never ending search  
Until I am with you  
For you, fill my life  
All my days and nights  
With memories of you
