A time for us, some day there'll be  
When chains are torn by courage born of a love that's free  
A time when dreams so long denied can flourish  
As we unveil the love we now must hide  
  
A time for us, at last to see  
A life worthwhile for you and me  
  
And with our love, through tears and thorns  
We will endure as we pass surely through every storm  
A time for us, some day there'll be a new world  
A world of shining hope for you and me  
  
For you and me  
  
And with our love, through tears and thorns  
We will endure as we pass surely through every storm  
A time for us, some day there'll be a new world  
A world of shining hope for you and me  
  
A world of shining hope for you and me

Ain't it true  
No matter what you do  
Someday when life is through  
They're gonna bury you  
Beneath the cold, cold ground, girl  
  
Big or small  
Or short or fat or tall  
It's gonna get us all  
Someday we're gonna fall  
Beneath the cold, cold ground, girl  
  
So you best believe it  
No matter what you do  
Yes, you best believe it  
Ain't it true, ain't it true  
Ain't it true  
  
My poor heart  
Was almost torn apart  
Because you played a part  
You thought that you were smart  
And now you're gone  
Gone, gone, girl  
  
All your life  
You treated me so bad  
You took the love I had  
And left me feeling sad  
But I'll go on, on, on, girl  
  
Cause I know that someday  
Your time will be due  
Yes, you'd best believe it  
Ain't it true, ain't it true  
Ain't it true  
  
I don't want to be the one  
To see you in such misery  
Not even for the things  
You went and done, done, done, girl  
  
There is time for  
You to change your mind  
And leave your cheating heart behind  
And turn the righteous kind  
Come back to me, girl  
  
And I will forgive you  
Here's what I'll say  
On that final day  
They lay you away  
There was never another like you  
  
Ain't it true, girl  
Ain't it true, girl  
  
And I will forgive you  
Here's what I'll say  
On that final day  
They lay you away  
There was never another like you  
  
Ain't it true, girl  
Ain't it true, girl

Almost there, we're almost there  
How wonderful, wonderful our love will be  
For you, for me  
  
We're almost there where we will share  
A warm caress, tenderness, a dream come true  
For me, for you  
  
Love has waited such a long time  
Now we're a kiss apart  
Darling, this is the right time  
To let the kisses start  
  
For you're almost mine and soon we'll find  
Our paradise, paradise so rare  
Close your eyes for we're almost there  
  
You're almost mine and soon we'll find  
Our paradise, paradise so rare  
Close your eyes, close your eyes  
Close your eyes for we're almost there  
Almost there  
Almost there

Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound,  
That saved a wretch like me  
I once was lost but now am found,  
Was blind, but now, I see  
  
T'was Grace that taught  
My heart to fear.  
And Grace, my fears relieved.  
How precious did that Grace appear  
The hour I first believed.  
  
Through many dangers, toils and snares  
We have already come.  
T'was Grace that brought us safe thus far  
And Grace will lead us home.  
  
The Lord has promised good to me  
His word my hope secures.  
He will my shield and portion be  
As long as life endures.  
  
When we've been here ten thousand years  
Bright shining as the sun.  
We've no less days to sing God's praise  
Then when we've first begun.  
  
"Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound,  
That saved a wretch like me  
I once was lost but now am found,  
Was blind, but now, I see.

Just an old fashioned love song  
Playin' on the radio  
And wrapped around the music  
Is the sound of someone  
Promising they'll never go  
You'll swear you've heard it before  
As it slowly rambles on and on  
No need in bringing 'em back  
'Cause they've never really gone  
  
Just an old fashioned love song  
Comin' down in three part harmony  
Just an old fashioned love song  
One I'm sure they wrote for you and me  
  
To weave our dreams upon  
And listen to each evening  
When the lights are low  
To underscore our love affair  
With tenderness and feelings  
That we've come to know  
You'll swear you've heard it before  
As it slowly rambles on and on  
No need in bringin' 'em back  
'Cause they've never really gone  
  
Just an old fashioned love song  
Comin' down in three part harmony  
Just an old fashioned love song  
One I'm sure they wrote for you and me  
  
Hit it!  
Wooh! Just an old fashioned love song  
Comin' down in three part harmony  
Just an old fashioned love song  
One I'm sure they wrote for you and me  
  
Just an old fashioned love song  
Comin' down in three part harmony  
Just an old fashioned love song  
One I'm sure they wrote for you and me (fade)

Words and Music by Ray Gilbert and Dorival Caymmi  
  
Every day I sent another present  
Just to let her know how very much I care  
I wrote a little love note with each present  
But it didn't seem to get me anywhere  
  
My poor worried heart was almost certain  
That this love affair would never be  
Then I sent a dozen yellow roses and  
From that moment she belonged to me  
  
Roses, roses, roses, I thank all the roses that bloom in the spring  
Love is a wonderful thing, the rest of my life I will bring her  
Roses and roses and roses of love  
  
Roses, roses, roses, I thank you for saying what I couldn't say  
Oh, what a wonderful way to tell her "I love you" each day  
With roses and roses and roses of love  
  
Roses, roses, roses, I thank all the roses that bloom in the spring  
Love is a wonderful thing, the rest of my life I will bring her  
Roses and roses and roses of love  
(Roses and roses and roses and roses of love)  
  
Fade  
Roses and roses and roses and roses of love

The falling leaves drift by the window  
The Autumn leaves of red and gold  
I see your lips, the summer kisses  
The sunburned hand I used to hold  
  
Since you went away the days grow long  
And soon I'll hear old winter's song  
But I miss you most of all, my darling  
When Autumn leaves start to fall  
  
I see your lips, the summer kisses  
The sunburned hand I used to hold  
  
Since you went away the days grow long  
And soon I'll hear old winter's song  
But I miss you most of all, my darling  
When Autumn leaves start to fall.

Be my love, for no one else can end this yearning  
This need that you and you alone create  
Just fill my arms the way you've filled my dreams  
The dreams that you inspire with ev'ry sweet desire  
Be my love, and with your kisses set me burning  
One kiss is all I need to seal my fate  
And hand in hand, we'll find love's promised land  
There'll be no one but you, for me eternally  
If you will be my love  
  
Be my love, for no one else can end this yearning  
This need that you and you alone create  
Just fill my arms the way you've filled my dreams

One kiss is all I need to seal my fate  
And hand in hand, we'll find love's promised land  
There'll be no one but you, for me eternally

Beyond the reef  
Where the sea is dark and cold,  
My love has gone,  
And our dreams grow old.  
There'll be no tears,  
There'll be no regretting.  
Will she remember me,  
Will she forget?  
I'll send a thousand flow'rs  
When the trade winds blow.  
I'll send my lonely heart,  
For i love her so.  
Someday i know  
She'll come back again to me.  
Till then my heart will be  
Beyond the reef  
  
Some day i know  
She'll come back again to me  
Till then my heart will be  
Beyond the reef

Night and you and blue hawaii  
The night is heavenly and you are heaven to me  
Lovely you and blue hawaii  
With all this loveliness there should be love  
Come with me while the moon is on the sea  
The night is young and so are we, so are we  
Dreams come true in blue hawaii  
And mine could all come true this magic night of nights with you  
Come with me while the moon is on the sea (the moon is on the sea)  
The night is young and so are we (so are we)  
Dreams come true in blue hawaii  
And mine could all come true this magic night of nights with you

I found my thrill on blueberry hill  
On blueberry hill where i found you  
The moon stood still on blueberry hill  
And lingered till my dreams came true  
  
The wind in the willow played  
Love's sweet melody  
But all of those vows we made  
Were never to be  
  
Tho' we're apart you're part of me still  
For you were my thrill on blueberry hill  
  
The wind in the willow played  
Love's sweet melody  
But all of those vows we made  
Were never to be  
  
Tho' we're apart you're part of me still  
For you were my thrill on blueberry hill

Born free, as free as the wind blows  
As free as the grass grows  
Born free to follow your heart  
  
Live free and beauty surrounds you  
The world still astounds you  
Each time you look at a star  
  
Stay free, where no walls divide you  
You're free as the roaring tide  
So there's no need to hide  
  
Born free, and life is worth living  
But only worth living  
'Cause you're born free  
  
(Stay free, where no walls divide you)  
You're free as the roaring tide  
So there's no need to hide  
  
Born free, and life is worth living  
But only worth living  
'Cause you're born free

You tell me you love me, you say you'll be true  
Then you fly around with somebody new  
But I'm crazy about you, you butterfly  
  
You treat me mean, you're makin' me cry  
I've made up my mind to tell you goodbye  
But I'm no good without you, you butterfly  
  
I knew from the first time I kissed you  
That you were the troublin' kind  
'Cause the honey drips from your sweet lips  
One taste and I'm outta my mind  
  
I love you so much I know what I'll do  
I'm clippin' your wings, your flyin' is through  
'Cause I'm crazy about you, you butterfly  
  
Ooh, I'm crazy about you, you butterfly  
Ooh, I can't live without you, you butterfly  
  
I knew from the first time I kissed you  
That you were the troublin' kind  
'Cause the honey that drips from your sweet lips

I'm clippin' your wings, your flyin' is through  
'Cause I'm crazy about you, you butterfly  
  
You butterfly  
You butterfly

Can I forget you?  
Or will my heart remind me,  
That once we walked in a moonlight dream?  
  
Can I forget you,  
Or will my heart remind me,  
How sweet you made the moonlight seem.  
  
Will the glory of your nearness fade,  
As moonlight fades in a veil of rain?  
  
Can I forget you,  
When every night reminds me,  
How much I want you back again.  
  
Can I forget you,  
When every night reminds me,  
How much I want you back again.

Once I was alone  
So lonely and then  
You came, out of nowhere  
Like the sun up from the hills  
  
Cold, cold was the wind  
Warm, warm were your lips  
Out there, on that ski trail  
Where your kiss filled me with thrills  
  
A weekend in Canada, a change of scene  
Was the most I bargained for  
And then I discovered you and in your eyes  
I found the love that I couldn't ignore  
  
Down, down came the sun  
Fast, fast, fast, beat my heart  
I knew when the sun set  
From that day, we'd never ever part  

Guess there's no use in hangin' 'round  
Guess I'll get dressed and do the town  
I'll find some crowded avenue  
Though it will be empty without you  
  
Can't get used to losin' you no matter what I try to do  
Gonna live my whole life thorough-loving you  
  
Called up some girl I used to know  
After I heard her say "Hello"  
Couldn't think of anything to say  
Since you're gone it happens every day  
  
Can't get used to losin' you no matter what I try to do  
Gonna live my whole life through-loving you  
  
I'll find somebody, wait and see  
Who am I kiddin', only me  
Cause no one else could take your place  
Guess that I am just a hopeless case  
  
Can't get used to losin' you no matter what I try to do  
Gonna live my whole life thorough-loving you  
  
I can't get used to losin' you no matter what I try to do  
Gonna live my whole life thorough-loving you

Wise men say, only fools rush in,  
But I cant help falling in love with you.  
Shall I stay, would it be a sin?  
If I cant help falling in love with you.  
  
Like a river flows, slowly to the sea,  
Darling so it goes,  
Some things are meant to be.  
  
Take my hand, take my whole life too.  
For I cant help falling in love with you.  
  
(Like a river flows, slowly to the sea,  
Darling so it goes,)  
  
Some things are meant to be.  
Take my hand, take my whole life too.  
For I cant help falling in love with you,  
  
For I cant help falling in love with you.

You're just too good to be true  
Can' t take my eyes off you  
You'd be like heaven to touch  
I want to hold you so much  
  
At long last love has arrived  
And I thank God I'm alive  
You're just too good to be true  
Can't take my eyes off you  
  
Pardon the way that I stare  
There's nothing else to compare  
The sight of you leaves me weak  
There are no words left to speak  
  
And if you feel like I feel  
Please let me know that it's real  
You're just too good to be true  
Can't take my eyes off you  
  
I love you baby, and if it's quite alright  
I need you baby to warm the lonely night  
I love you baby  
Trust in me when I say  
  
Oh pretty baby, don't bring me down I pray  
Oh pretty baby, now that I've found you stay  
And let me love you baby  
Let me love you  
  
You're just too good to be true  
Can't take my eyes off you  
You'd be like heaven to touch  
I want to hold you so much  
  
I love you baby, and if it's quite alright  
I need you baby to warm the lonely night  
I love you baby  
Trust in me when I say  
  
Oh pretty baby, don't bring me down I pray  
Oh pretty baby, now that I've found you stay  
And let me love you baby  
Let me love you

When we played our charade  
We were like children posing  
Playing at games, acting out names  
Guessing the parts we played  
  
Oh what a hit we made  
We came on next to closing  
Best on the bill, lovers until  
Love left the masquerade  
  
Fate seemed to pull the strings  
I turned and you were gone  
While from the darkened wings  
The music box played on  
  
Sad little serenade  
Song of my heart's composing  
I hear it still, I always will  
Best on the bill  
Charade

Christmas present, Christmas tree  
Children's eyes are wide to see  
Santa's presents 'neath the tree  
All day asked for on his knee  
  
Christmas present, Christmas past  
From the presents which one's last  
Christmas future sure to be  
Looking underneath the tree  
  
For the present, look high, not low  
Christmas was a gift itself many years ago  
Christmas presents at the start  
Was a gift from someone's heart  
  
Christ is Christmas, that day is His  
That's what Christmas presents is

Frosted window panes, candles gleaming inside  
Painted candy canes on the tree  
Santa's on his way, he's filled his sleigh with things  
Things for you and for me  
  
It's that time of year when the world falls in love  
Ev'ry song you hear seems to say "Merry Christmas,  
"May your New Year dreams come true"  
And this song of mine in three-quarter time  
Wishes you and yours the same thing, too  
  
Frosted window panes, candles gleaming inside

Oh, Danny boy  
The pipes, the pipes are calling  
From glen to glen  
And down the mountainside  
  
The summer's gone  
And all the roses falling  
It's you, it's you must go  
And I must bide  
  
But come ye back when  
Summer's in the meadow  
Or when the valley's hushed  
And white with snow  
  
It's I'll be here in  
Sunshine or in shadow  
Oh, Danny boy, oh, Danny boy  
I love you so  
  
Oh, Danny boy, oh, Danny boy  
I love you so

Dear heart wish you were here to warm this night  
My dear heart, seems like a year since you've been out of my sight  
A single room, a table for one  
It's a lonesome town all right  
But soon I'll kiss you hello at our front door  
And dear heart I want you to know  
I'll leave your arms never more  
  
(A single room, a table for one)  
It's a lonesome town all right  
But soon I'll kiss you hello at our front door  
And dear heart I want you to know  
I'll leave your arms never more

Said the nightwind to the little lamb  
Do you see what I see  
(Do you see what I see)  
Way up in the sky little lamb  
Do you see what I see  
(Do you see what I see)  
  
A star, a star, dancing in the night  
With a tail as big as a kite  
With a tail as big as a kite  
  
Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy  
Do you hear what I hear  
(Do you hear what I hear)  
Ringing through the sky shepherd boy  
Do you hear what I hear  
(Do you hear what I hear)  
  
A song, a song, high above the trees  
With a voice as big as the sea  
With a voice as big as the sea  
  
Said the shepherd boy to the mighty king  
Do you know what I know  
(Do you know what I know)  
In your palace oh mighty king  
Do you know what I know  
(Do you know what I know)  
  
A child, a child, shivers in the cold  
Let us bring him silver and gold  
Let us bring him silver and gold  
  
Said the king to the people everywhere  
Listen to what I say  
(Listen to what I say)  
Pray for peace people everywhere  
Listen to what I say  
(Listen to what I say)  
  
A child, a child, sleeping in the night  
He will bring us goodness and light  
He will bring us goodness and light  
  
Do you hear what I hear  
  
A child, a child, sleeping in the night  
He will bring us goodness and light  
He will bring us goodness and light  
  
Listen  
Do you hear what I hear  
Do you hear what I hear  
Listen

If I say I love you  
Do you mind  
Make a night, I love you  
Do you mind  
  
If I shower you with kisses  
If I tell you, honey, this is  
How I think of Heaven  
Do you mind  
  
I'd like to whisper  
Whisper sweet nothings in your ear  
Nothings that were meant  
For my love alone to hear  
  
If I say I love you  
Do you mind  
Make a night, I love you  
Do you mind  
  
If I shower you with kisses  
If I tell you, honey, this is  
How I think of Heaven  
Do you mind  
  
I'd like to whisper  
Whisper sweet nothings in your ear  
Nothings that were meant  
For my love alone to hear  
  
And if I say I love you  
Do you mind  
Make a night, I love you  
Do you mind  
  
And if I shower you with kisses  
If I tell you, honey, this is  
How I think of Heaven  
Do you mind  
  
Do you mind  
Mmm, do you mind  
If I say I love you  
Do you mind

If you should hear  
That someone new  
Has eased the pain  
Of losing you  
  
[Chorus:]  
Don't you believe it  
Not for a moment  
Don't you believe it  
Because it isn't true  
  
Those angry words  
That made us part  
Put out the flame  
That's in my heart  
  
[Repeat chorus]  
  
I haven't changed  
I still love you  
And it will always be  
  
I only hope and  
I pray each night  
You'll feel the  
Same about me  
  
So if you hear  
Some false alarms  
Like you're not welcome  
In my arms  
  
[Repeat chorus]  
  
Oh, how I still love you

Emily, Emily  
  
Emily, Emily, Emily  
As the murmuring sound of May  
Of silver bells, coral shells, carousels  
And the laughter of children at play  
  
Say Emily, Emily, Emily  
And we fade to our marvelous view  
Two lovers alone and out of sight  
Seeing images in the firelight  
As my eyes visualize a family  
They see Emily, Emily  
  
As my eyes visualize a family  
They see Emily, Emily too

Just yesterday mornin', they let me know you were gone  
Suzanne the plans they made put an end to you  
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song  
I just can't remember who to send it to  
  
I've seen fire and I've seen rain  
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end  
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend  
But I always thought that I'd see you again  
  
Won't you look down upon me, Jesus  
You've got to help me make a stand  
You've just got to see me through another day  
My body's aching and my time is at hand  
I won't make it any other way  
  
I've seen fire and I've seen rain  
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end  
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend  
But I always thought that I'd see you again  
  
Been walking my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun  
Lord knows when the cold wind blows, it'll turn your head around  
Well there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to  
Come  
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground  
  
I've seen fire and I've seen rain  
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end  
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend  
But I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again, now  
  
Thought I'd see you one more time again  
There's just a few things coming my way this time around now  
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you, fire and rain now  
Na na na. Na na na na na na na na na na. Na na na na na na na na  
  
I've seen fire and I've seen rain  
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end  
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend  
But I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again, now  
  
Thought I'd see you one more time again  
There's just a few things coming my way this time around now  
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you, fire and rain now

Fly by night (fly by night)  
Please pity me (fly by night)  
I fall in love so easily  
  
Oh, fly by night (fly by night)  
Don't fly away (from me)  
  
Take my heart (fly by night)  
It's yours alone (fly by night)  
Forever more to have and own  
  
Oh, fly by night (fly by night)  
Don't fly away (from me)  
  
Be my angel true  
Not my butterfly  
For though they both have wings  
Angels don't say goodbye  
  
In my arms (fly by night)  
There's love for you (fly by night)  
So, please say you love me true  
  
Oh, fly by night (fly by night)  
Don't fly away (fly ny night)  
Oh, fly by night (fly by night)  
Don't fly away (fly ny night)  
Oh, fly by night

Speak softly love and hold me warm against your heart  
I feel your words the tender trembling moment start  
We're in a world, our very own  
Sharing a love that only few have ever known  
  
Wine colored days warmed by the sun  
Deep velvet nights, when we are one  
  
Speak softly love so no one hears us but the sky  
The vows of love we make will live until we die  
My life is yours, and all because  
You came into my world with love so softly love  
  
Wine colored days warmed by the sun  
Deep velvet nights, when we are one  
  
Speak softly love so no one hears us but the sky  
The vows of love we make will live until we die  
My life is yours, and all because  
You came into my world with love  
So softly love

So this is Christmas  
And what have you done  
Another year's over  
And a new one's begun  
  
And so this is Christmas  
I hope you had fun  
The near and the dear one  
The old and the young  
  
A Merry, Merry Christmas  
And a Happy New Year  
Let's hope it's a good one  
Without any fear  
  
And so this is Christmas  
(War is over)  
For weak and for strong

The rich and the poor ones  
(War is over)  
Who waited so long  
(Ohh)  
  
And so Happy Christmas  
(War is over)  
For black and for white  
(If you want it)  
For yellow and red ones  
(War is over)  
Let's stop all the fight  
(Now)  
  
A Merry, Merry Christmas  
And a Happy New Year  
Let's hope it's a good one  
Without any fear

There's a certain sound always follows me around  
When you're close to me you will hear it  
It's the sound that lovers hear when they discover  
There could be no other for their love  
  
[CHORUS:]  
  
It's my happy heart you hear  
Singing loud and singing clear  
And it's all because you're near me, my love  
Take my happy heart away  
Let me love you night and day  
In your arms I want to stay, oh my love  
  
Feeling more and more like I've never felt before  
You have changed my life so completely  
Music fills my soul now, I've lost all control now  
I'm not half, I'm whole now with your love

Have yourself a merry little Christmas  
Let your heart be light  
From now on our troubles will be out of sight  
  
Have yourself a merry little Christmas  
Make the Yuletide gay  
From now on our troubles will be miles away  
  
Here we are as in olden days  
Happy golden days of yore  
Faithful friends who are dear to us  
Gather near to us once more  
  
Through the years we all will be together  
If the fates allow  
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough  
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now  
  
Here we are as in olden days  
Happy golden days of yore  
Faithful friends who are dear to us  
Gather near to us once more  
  
Oh, through the years we all will be together  
If the fates allow  
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough  
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now

I heard the bells on Christmas Day  
Their old familiar carols play  
And wild and sweet the words repeat  
Of peace on Earth, good will to men  
  
I thought how as the day had come  
The belfries of all Christendom  
Had rolled along the unbroken song  
Of peace on Earth, good will to men  
  
And in despair, I bowed my head  
There is no peace on Earth, I said  
For hate is strong and mocks the song  
Of peace on Earth, good will to men  
  
Then pealed the bells more loud and deep  
God is not dead, nor doth He sleep  
The wrong shall fail, the right prevail  
With peace on Earth, good will to men  
  
With peace on Earth, good will to men

Golden sun is rising in the sky  
Emerald birds glide through a rainbow as they fly  
Bringing beauty Holly enters my mind.  
  
Where the crystal ocean finds the shore  
Diamond waves reflect the love we shared before  
Through the silence Holly enters my mind.  
  
All alone as I walk by the sea  
Thoughts of Holly are my company  
For she calls to me with each shining ray  
With each season's change  
With the sun and the sea and the sky she remains.  
  
Though the world must take her far away  
On a velvet wind she comes to me each day  
When I'm lonely Holly enters my mind  
When I'm lonely Holly enters my mind

(Hummed intro)  
  
The harbor lights were shining,  
The moon was at its high.  
The captain said, "Thank God we're home!  
We've drunk the barrels dry."  
The mizzen mast was shaken,  
And the lanterns all burned low,  
I'd never thought we'd make it  
But we've twenty leagues to go  
So blow you southern trades  
And guide me safely to the shore,  
I'll never ever gonna sail  
The seven seas no more  
  
CHORUS:  
I don't want to miss the sand in my hair,  
The roll of the tide and the salt in the air  
Deep inside it's true  
I'm a home lovin' man  
Comin' on home to you  
I don't want to miss the wind in my eyes,  
The shimmerin' light when the seagull flies  
Lo, I've traveled far  
I'm a home loving man,  
Home is where you are  
  
The crowd upon the quayside  
Their faces long and drawn  
Are suddenly awakened  
As we sail in on the dawn  
The wives, the sons, the lovers,  
Who never gave up hope  
All breathe a sigh together  
As they reach to catch the rope  
  
God bless you, southern trades,  
You got me safely back this time  
Oh, you'll never have the need again  
To save this soul of mine  
  
CHORUS  
  
REPEAT CHORUS:  
Yes, I don't want to miss the sand in my hair,  
The roll of the tides and the salt in the air  
Deep inside it's true  
I'm a home lovin' man  
Comin' on home to you...  
  
FADE

This is hopeless  
Yes, it's so hopeless  
Cause you're not  
Coming back anymore  
  
Oh, I tried  
Yes, I tried to forget you  
I've tried running around  
But I find  
  
That it's hopeless  
Yes, it's hopeless  
I just can't get you  
Out of my mind  
  
I keep telling my heart  
That I'm lucky  
That I'm much better off  
All alone  
  
But it's hopeless  
It's just hopeless  
Cause my heart has  
A mind of it's own  
  
I walk away the nights  
Until the city lights  
Fade into another lonely day  
  
I still can't go to bed  
I walk some more instead  
But I just can't  
Walk those blues away  
  
I keep praying that you'll  
Change your mind, dear  
And I'll see your  
Sweet face at the door  
  
But it's hopeless  
Yes, it's so hopeless  
Cause you're not  
Coming back anymore  
  
Yes, it's so hopeless

How wonderful to know you really love me  
How wonderful to know you really care  
How beautiful to feel my arms around you  
Kissing your eyes, hearing your sighs, touch your hair  
How wonderful to know sunshine and laughter  
That fills my empty heart with love  
To share this life with you and hereafter  
How wonderful to know that you are mine  
How wonderful to know sunshine and laughter  
That fills my empty heart with love divine  
To share this life with you and hereafter  
How wonderful to know that you are mine  
To share this life with you and hereafter  
How wonderful to know that you are mine  

Oh honey babe, oh honey babe  
Oh honey babe, I like your kind of love  
That's good, baby that's good  
  
Honey babe, I like the way that you walk by  
I like the way you swing your eye  
I like your kind of love  
That's good, baby that's good  
  
Every night I like the way you beg for more  
And linger there outside the door  
I like your kind of love  
That's good, baby that's good  
  
Well, well, well-ll-ll ain't it swell  
Can't reveal-l-l how I feel  
And no one else could ever thrill me like you do  
You make my every dream come true  
I like your kind of love  
That's good, baby that's good  
  
Oh honey babe, oooo honey babe  
MMMMM honey babe  
I like your kind of love  
That's good, baby that's good  
  
Honey baby I like the way you wear your clothes  
My love for you just grows and grows  
I like your kind of love  
Honey you know I do  
  
When you're near you don't know what you do to me  
And that's the way it oughta be  
I like your kind of love  
Honey you know I do  
  
Don't you know-o-o that I love you so  
Can't you see-e-e that you're for me  
Honey babe I like the way you hold my hand  
To make me know you understand  
I like your kind of love  
Honey you know I do  
Oh honey babe, oooo honey babe  
MMMMM honey babe  
I like your kind of love  
That's good, baby that's good  
Honey babe I like your kind of love  
  
FADE

I want to be free like the bluebird flying by me  
Like the waves out on the blue sea  
Your love has to tie me, don't try me, say goodbye  
  
I want to be free, don't say you love me, say you like me  
But when I need you beside me  
Stay close enough to guide me, confide in me, oh-oh-oh-oh  
  
I want to hold your hand, walk along the sand  
Laughin' in the sun, always havin' fun  
Doin' all those things without any strings to tie me down  
  
I want to be free like the warm September wind, babe  
Say you'll always be my friend , babe  
We can make it to the end, babe  
Again, babe, I gotta say  
  
I want to be free  
I want to be free  
I want to be free

Goodbye, no use leading with our chins, this is where our story ends,  
Never lovers ever friends.  
Goodbye, let our hearts call it a day, but before you walk away,  
I sincerely want to say.  
  
I wish you bluebirds in the spring, to give your heart a song to sing,  
And then a kiss, but more than this, I wish you love.  
And if you like lemonade to cool you in some lazy glade,  
I wish you health, and more than wealth, I wish you love.  
My breaking heart and I agree that you and I could never be,  
So with my best, my very best, I set you free.  
I wish you shelter from the storm, a cozy fire to keep you warm,  
Most of all, when snowflakes fall, I wish you love.  
  
I wish you shelter from the storm, a cozy fire to keep you warm,  
Most of all, when snowflakes fall, hot time, I wish you love.  
All kinds of love, a whole gang of love.

If ever I would leave you, it wouldn't be in summer  
Seeing you in summer, I never would go  
Your hair streaked with sunlight, your lips red as flame  
Your face with a luster that puts gold to shame  
  
But if I'd ever leave you, it couldn't be in autumn  
How I'd leave in autumn, I never will know  
I've seen how you sparkle when fall nips the air  
I know you in autumn and I must be there  
  
And could I leave you running merrily through the snow  
Or on a wintry evening when you catch the fire's glow  
  
If ever I would leave you, how could it be in springtime  
Knowing how in spring I'm bewitched by you so  
Oh, no, not in springtime, summer, winter, or fall  
No never could I leave you at all

If I had only known, it was our last walk in the rain  
I'd keep you out for hours in the storm  
And I would hold your hand like a lifeline to my heart  
Underneath the thunder we'd be warm  
If I had only known it was our last walk in the rain  
If I had only known, I'd never hear your voice again  
I'd memorize each thing you ever said  
And on those lonely nights, I could think of them once more  
Keep your words alive inside my head  
If I had only known, I'd never hear your voice again  
Come back let me hold you one more time  
Let me say goodbye  
If I had only known, it was my last night in your arms  
I'd pray a miracle would stop the dawn  
And by the candle's glow, I would look into your eyes  
And make sure you know my love for you goes on and on  
If I had only known, oh, if I had only known  
The love I would've shown if I had only known  

I was sleeping and right in the middle of a good dream  
Like all at once I wake up from something that keeps knocking at my brain  
Before I go insane I hold my pillow to my head  
And spring up in my bed screaming out the words I dread  
I think I love you (I think I love you)  
  
This morning I woke up with this feeling  
I didn't know how to deal with and so I just decided to myself  
I'd hide it to myself and never talk about it  
And did not go and shout it when you walked into the room  
I think I love you (I think I love you)  
  
I think I love you so what am I so afraid of  
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of a love there is no cure for  
  
I think I love you isn't that what life is made of  
Though it worries me to say that I never felt this way  
  
I don't know what I'm up against  
I don't know what it's all about  
I got so much to think about  
  
Hey, I think I love you so what am I so afraid of  
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of a love there is no cure for  
  
I think I love you isn't that what life is made of  
Though it worries me to say I never felt this way  
  
Believe me you really don't have to worry  
I only wanna make you happy and if you say "hey go away" I will  
But I think better still I'd better stay around and love you  
Do you think I have a case let me ask you to your face  
Do you think you love me?  
  
I think I love you  
I think I love you  
I think I love you  
I think I love you  
I think I love you  
I think I love you  
I think I love you  
I think I love you

It had to be you, it had to be you.  
I wandered around and finally found the somebody who  
Could make me be true, could make me feel blue,  
And even be glad just to be sad thinkin' of you.  
  
Some others I've seen might never be mean  
Might never be cross or try to be boss,  
But they wouldn't do.  
For nobody else gave me a thrill.  
With all your faults, I love you still,  
It had to be you, wonderful you,  
It had to be you.  
  
It had to be you, it had to be you.  
I wandered around and finally found somebody who  
Could make me be true, could make me be blue,  
And even be glad just to be sad thinkin' of you.  
  
Some others I've seen might never be mean  
Might never be cross or try to be boss,  
But they wouldn't do.  
  
For nobody else gave me a thrill.  
With all your faults, I love you still.  
  
It had to be you, wonderful you  
  
It had to be you.

I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm  
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string  
I'd say that I had Spring fever  
But I know it isn't Spring  
  
I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented  
Like a nightingale without a song to sing  
Oh, why should I have Spring fever  
When it isn't even Spring?  
  
I keep wishing I were somewhere else  
Walking down a strange new street  
Hearing words that I have never heard  
From a girl I've yet to meet  
  
I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams  
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing  
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing  
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way  
That it might as well be Spring  
  
It might as well be Spring

It's impossible, tell the sun to leave the sky  
It's just impossible  
It's impossible, ask a baby not to cry  
It's just impossible  
  
Can I hold you closer to me  
And not feel you going through me?  
Split the second that I never think of you  
Oh, how impossible  
  
Can the ocean keep from rushing to the shore?  
It's just impossible  
If I had you, could I ever run for more?  
It's just impossible  
  
And tomorrow, should you ask me for the world  
Somehow I'd get it, I would sell my very soul  
And not regret it for to live without your love  
Is just impossible  
  
Can the ocean keep from rushing to the shore?  
It's just impossible  
If I had you, could I ever run for more?  
It's just impossible  
  
And tomorrow, should you ask me for the world  
Somehow I'd get it, I would sell my very soul  
And not regret it for to live without your love  
Is just impossible, impossible, impossible

I've grown accustomed to her face  
She almost makes the day begin  
I've grown accustomed to the tune she whistles night and noon  
Her smiles, her frowns, her ups, her downs  
Are second nature to me now  
Like breathing out and breathing in  
I was serenely independent and content before we met  
Surely I could always be that way again and yet  
I've grown accustomed to her looks, accustomed to her voice  
Accustomed to her face  
I'm very grateful she's a woman and so easy to forget  
Rather like a habit one can always break and yet  
I've grown accustomed to the trace of something in the air  
Accustomed to her face

Slow dance, last chance  
Time for romance  
Someone needs somebody  
Someone wants to share  
  
When a heart find each other  
Oh, love will be there  
It's a part of a game  
That's as old as the rain  
  
Slow dance, last chance  
One move, one glance  
And love took me over  
When I took your hand  
  
And I pull you closer, so you understand  
If you're lonely tonight  
Won't you please hold me tight  
It's a slow dance, last chance  
  
If you're lonely tonight  
Won't you please hold me tight  
It's a slow dance, last chance

We don't exist  
We are nothing but shadow and mist  
In the mirror we look as we pass  
Our reflections revealed in the glass  
  
Don't you know that the blood in your veins  
Is as lifeless as yesterday's rain  
It's a game where we come and conceal  
The confusion we feel  
As long as we're nameless  
Our bodies are blameless  
  
You cried when we kissed  
It was nothing but shadow and mist  
Two illusion who touch in a trance  
Making love not by choice, but by chance  
  
To a theme we tore from their past  
To a tango we swore was their last  
We are shadows of dance  
  
As long as we're nameless  
Our bodies are blameless  
  
You cried when we kissed  
It was nothing but shadow and mist  
Two illusions who touch in a trance  
Making love not by choice, but by chance  
To a theme that we tore from their past  
To a tango we swore was their last  
We are shadows of dance  
  
The last tango  
The last tango

God bless the day I found you  
I want to stay around you  
And so I beg you  
Let it be me  
  
Don't take this Heaven from one  
Well if you must cling to someone  
Now and forever  
Let it be me  
  
Each time we meet love  
I find complete love  
Without your sweet love  
Tell me, what would life be?  
  
So never leave me lonely  
Just tell me you love me only  
And that you'll always  
Let it be me  
  
Each time we meet love  
I find complete love  
Oh without your sweet love  
Tell me, what would life be?  
  
So never leave me lonely  
And just tell me you love me only  
And that you'll always  
Let it be me  
  
And that you'll always  
Let it be me  
  
So never leave me lonely  
Tell me you love me only  
And that you'll always  
Let it be me

Oh, the weather outside is frightful  
But the fire is so delightful  
Since we've no place to go  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
  
It doesn't show signs of stoppin'  
And I brought some corn for poppin'  
The lights are turned down low  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
  
When we finally kiss good night  
How I'll hate goin' out in the storm  
But if you really hold me tight  
All the way home I'll be warm  
  
The fire is slowly dying  
And, my dear, we're still good-bye-in'  
But as long as you love me so  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
  
(When we finally kiss good night)  
How I'll hate goin' out in the storm  
(But if you really hold me tight)  
All the way home I'll be war-are-arm  
  
The fire is slowly dying  
And, my dear, we're still good-bye-in'  
But as long as you love me so  
Let it snow, let it snow  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
  
Let it snow

I tasted your sweet lips, thrilled to my fingertips  
Lips of wine, warm with fire, you are my one desire  
Lips of wine, and they are mine  
  
While tropic breezes play, while palm trees gently sway  
Lips of wine, come to me, whisper low so tenderly  
Lips of wine, and they are mine  
  
Sweet Hawaiian miss, no more will I roam  
I must have your kiss and I can't go home  
  
You stole my heart from me, pretty rose of Waikiki  
Lips of wine, sweet and rare, tell me you will always care  
Lips of wine, and they are mine  
  
(Sweet lips, sweet and tasty lips)  
  
Sweet Hawaiian miss, no more will I roam  
I must have your kiss and I can't go home  
  
I tasted you sweet lips (sweet lips, your sweet and tasty lips)  
Thrilled to my fingertips (sweet lips, your sweet and tasty lips)  
Lips of wine, warm with fire, you are my one desire  
Lips of wine (sweet lips) and they are mine (sweet lips of wine)  
And they are mine (sweet lips of wine)  
FADE  
Ooh, they are mine (sweet lips of wine)

Where's this place called "Lonely Stree-ee-ee-eet?"  
  
I'm looking for that lonely street  
I've got a sad, sad tale to tell  
I need a place to go and weep  
Where's this place called "Lonely Stree-ee-ee-eet?"  
  
A place where there's just loneliness  
Where dim lights bring forgetfulness  
Where broken dreams and mem'ries meet  
Where's this place called "Lonely Stree-ee-ee-eet?"  
  
Perhaps upon that lonely street  
There's someone such as I  
Who came to bury broken dreams  
And watch an old love di-ie  
  
If I could find that lonely street  
Where dim lights bring forgetfulness  
Where broken dreams and mem'ries meet  
Where's this place called "Lonely Stree-ee-ee-eet?"  
  
Where's this place called "Lonely Stree-ee-ee-eet?"

Love is a many splendored thing  
It's the April rose that only grows in the early Spring  
Love is nature's way of giving a reason to be living  
The golden crown that makes a man a king  
Once on a high and windy hill, In the morning mist  
Two lovers kissed and the world stood still  
Then your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it how to sing  
Yes, true love's a many splendored thing

On a day like today  
We pass the time away  
Writing love letters in the sand  
  
How you laughed when i cried  
Each time i saw the tide  
Take our love letters from the sand  
  
You made a vow that you would ever be true  
But somehow that vow meant nothing to you  
  
Now my broken heart aches  
With every wave that breaks  
Over love letters in the sand  
  
Now my broken heart aches  
With every wave that breaks  
Over love letters in the sand

Spring was never waiting for us, girl  
It ran one step ahead  
As we followed in the dance  
Between the parted pages and were pressed  
In love's hot fevered iron  
Like a striped pair of pants  
  
I recall the yellow cotton dress  
It was foaming like a wave  
On the ground around your knees  
The birds, like tender babies in your hands  
And the old men playing  
Checkers by the trees  
  
MacArthur Park is melting in the dark  
All the sweet green icing flowing down  
Oh, someone left the cake out in the rain  
And I don't think that I can take it  
Cause it took so long to bake it  
And I'll never have that recipe again  
Oh, no, oh no  
  
There will be another song for me  
For I will sing it  
There will be another dream for me  
Oh, someone will bring it  
  
I will drink the wine while it is warm  
And never let you catch me looking at the sun  
And after all the loves of my life  
After all the loves of my life, you'll still be the one  
Little girl  
  
I will take my life into my hands, I will use it  
I will win the worship in their eyes oh and I will lose it  
I will have the things that I desire  
And my passion flow like rivers through the sky  
  
And after all the loves of my life  
After all the loves of my life  
I'll be thinking of you  
And wondering why  
  
MacArthur Park is melting in the dark  
All the sweet, green icing flowing down  
Oh, someone left the cake out in the rain  
And I don't think that I can take it  
Cause it took so long to bake it  
And I'll never have that recipe again  
Oh no, oh no, no

Long time ago in Bethlehem  
So the holy Bible say  
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ  
Was born on Christmas day  
  
Hark now hear the angels sing  
A new King's born today  
And man will live forevermore  
Because of Christmas day  
  
While shepherds watch their flock by night  
They saw a bright new shining star  
And heard a choir from Heaven sing  
The music came from afar  
  
Hark now hear the angels sing  
A new King's born today  
And man will live forevermore  
Because of Christmas day  
  
Now Joseph and his wife Mary  
Came to Bethlehem that night  
They found no place to bare her child  
Not a single room was in sight  
  
By and by they find a little nook  
In a stable all forlorn  
And in a manger cold and dark  
Mary's little Boy Child was born  
  
Trumpets sound and angels sing  
Listen what they say  
That man will live forevermore  
Because of Christmas day

Moon river, wider than a mile  
I'm crossing you in style some day  
Oh, dream maker, you heart breaker  
Wherever you're goin', I'm goin' your way  
  
Two drifters, off to see the world  
There's such a lot of world to see  
We're after the same rainbow's end, waitin' 'round the bend  
My huckleberry friend, moon river, and me

We're after that same rainbow's end, waitin' 'round the  
Bend  
My huckleberry friend, moon river, and me

More than the greatest love the world has known  
This is the love I give to you alone  
More than the simplest words I try to say  
I only live to love you more each day  
More than you'll never know my arms long to hold your soul  
My life will be in your keeping, waking, sleeping, laughing, weeping  
Longer than always is long long time,  
But far beyond forever you'll be mine  
I know I never live before and my heart is very sure  
No one else could love you more  
I know I never live before and my heart is very sure  
No one else could love you more

The boys watch the girls while the girls watch the boys who watch the girls go
by  
Eye to eye, they solemnly convene to make the scene  
Which is the name of the game, watch a guy watch a dame on any street in town  
Up and down and over and across, romance is boss  
  
Guys talk "girl talk", it happens everywhere  
Eyes watch girls walk with tender lovin' care  
  
It's keepin' track of the fact watching them watching back  
That makes the world go 'round  
"What's that sound?" each time you hear a loud collective sigh  
They're making music to watch girls by

For those who fancy coloring books  
As certain people do  
Here's a new one for you  
A most unusual coloring book  
The kind you never see  
Crayons ready, very well  
Begin to color me  
  
These are the eyes that watched him  
As he walked away  
Color them gray  
This is the heart that thought  
He would always be true  
Color it blue  
These are the arms that held him  
  
And touched him then lost him somehow  
Color them empty now  
These are the beads I wore  
Until she came between  
Color them green  
This is the room I sleep in  
Walk in and weep in  
Hide in that nobody sees  
Color it lonely, please  
This is the man  
The one I depended upon  
Color him gone...

Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens  
Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens  
Brown paper packages tied up with strings  
These are a few of my favorite things  
  
Cream colored ponies and crisp apple streudels  
Doorbells and sleigh bells and schnitzel with noodles  
Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings  
These are a few of my favorite things  
  
Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes  
Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes  
Silver white winters that melt into springs  
These are a few of my favorite things  
  
When the dog bites  
When the bee stings  
When I'm feeling sad  
I simply remember my favorite things  
And then I don't feel so bad  
  
When the dog bites

My funny valentine, sweet comic valentine  
You make me smile with my heart  
Your looks are laughable, un-photographable  
Yet, you're my favorite work of art  
  
Is your figure less than Greek?  
Is your mouth a little weak?  
When you open it to speak  
Are you smart?  
  
Don't change a hair for me  
Not if you care for me  
Stay, little valentine, stay  
Each day is Valentine's Day  
  
Don't change a hair for me  
Not if you care for me  
Stay, little valentine, stay  
Each day is Valentine's Day

Evening shadows make me blue  
When each weary day is through  
How I long to be with you  
My happiness  
  
Every day I reminisce  
Dreaming of your tender kiss  
Always thinking how I miss  
My happiness  
  
A million years it seems  
Have gone by since we shared our dreams  
But I'll hold you again  
There'll be no blue memories then  
  
Whether skies are gray or blue  
Any place on earth will do  
Just as long as I'm with you  
My happiness

There's just one place for me, near you  
It's like heaven to be, near you  
Times when we're apart  
I can't face my heart  
Say you'll never stray  
More than just two lips away  
  
If my hours could be spent near you  
I'd be more than content near you  
Make my life worthwhile  
By telling me that I'll  
Spend the rest of my days near you  
  
There is just one place for me, I'm happy when I'm near you  
It's wonderful as heaven, a special kind of heaven, but only when I'm near you  
Times when we're apart I wonder how I can face my heart  
Say you'll never stray  
More than just two lips away  
  
If my waking hours could be spent while near you  
I would be content, wonderfully content, just to be near you  
Make my life worthwhile  
By telling me that I'll  
Spend the rest of my days  
All of those happy, happy days  
So near you

Oh, you can kiss me on a Monday  
A Monday, a Monday is very, very good  
Or you can kiss me on a Tuesday  
A Tuesday, a Tuesday, in fact I wish you would  
Or you can kiss me on a Wednesday  
A Thursday, a Friday and Saturday is best  
But never, never on a Sunday  
A Sunday, a Sunday, 'cause that's my day of rest  
  
Most any day you can be my guest  
Any day you say, but my day of rest  
Just name the day that you like the best  
Only stay away on my day of rest  
  
Oh, you can kiss me on a cool day, a hot day  
A wet day, which everyone you choose  
Or try to kiss me on a gray day, a May day  
A pay day, and see if I refuse  
And if you make it on a bleak day  
A freak day, a week day, why you can be my guest  
But never, never on a Sunday

I'll catch a moonbeam to make you a gown  
Snowflakes to wear in your hair like a crown  
And you'll wear them well  
Noelle, Noelle  
  
Rainbows will make you a ring for your hand  
Stardust will carpet your own wonderland  
There you'll always dwell  
Noelle, Noelle  
  
You're the smallest miracle  
That I will ever see  
But you're the greatest thing  
That ever happened to me  
  
Angels will whisper to bring you a breeze  
I'll make you music from their melodies  
This I can foretell  
For you, for you  
Noelle

O holy night!  
The stars are brightly shining,  
It is the night  
Of the dear Savior's birth  
  
Long lay the world  
In sin and error pining  
Till He appeared  
And the Soul felt its worth  
  
A thrill of hope  
The weary soul rejoices,  
For yonder breaks  
A new and glorious morn  
  
Fall on your knees!  
Oh, hear the angel voices!  
O night divine,  
O night when Christ was born  
O night, O holy night,  
O night divine!  
  
O night divine,  
O night when Christ was born  
O night,  
O holy night,  
O night divine!  
O night when Christ was born

I have often walked down this street before  
But the pavement always stayed beneath my feet before  
All at once am I several stories high  
Knowing I'm on the street where you live  
  
Are there lilac trees in the heart of town?  
Can you hear a lark in any other part of town?  
Does enchantment pour out of every door?  
No, it's just on the street where you live  
  
And oh, the towering feeling just to know somehow you are near  
The overpowering feeling that any second you may suddenly appear  
  
People stop and stare, they don't bother me  
For there's nowhere else on earth that I would rather be  
Let the time go by, I won't care if I  
Can be here on the street where you live

People, people who need people  
Are the luckiest people in the world  
  
We're children needing other children  
And yet, letting our grown up pride  
Hide all the need inside  
Acting more like children than children  
  
Lovers, are very special people  
They're the luckiest people in the world  
With one person  
One very special person  
A feeling deep in your soul says  
You were half, now you're whole  
  
No more hunger and thirst  
But first be a person who needs people  
People who need people  
Are the luckiest people in the world

Promise me love, promise me  
Kisses sweet love, meant for me  
Promise me love  
That you'll love me tenderly  
Oh love, promise me (promise me)  
  
Promise me love, promise me (oh, promise me)  
Arms to hold love, never set me free (oh, promise me)  
Promise me love  
That you'll love me tenderly  
Oh love, promise me (oh, promise me)  
  
I promise you blue cornflowers for your hair  
A golden necklace and my heart I swear  
I promise you a million promises I'd do  
And they'll come true  
Oh love, I promise you (ooh-ooh)  
  
Promise me love, promise me (oh, promise me)  
You'll be my love eternally (oh, promise me)  
Swear it true love that you'll love me tenderly  
Oh love, promise me (oh, promise me, love, oh, promise me)  
  
I promise you blue cornflowers for your hair  
A golden necklace and a ring to wear  
I promise you a million promises I'd do  
And they'll come true  
Oh love, I promise you (ooh-ooh)  
  
Promise me love, promise me  
You'll be my love eternally (oh, promise me)  
Swear it true love, that you'll love me tenderly  
Oh love, promise me (oh, promise me, love, oh, promise me)  
  
Oh, promise me  
(Oh, promise me, love, oh, promise me)

I want some red roses for a blue lady  
Mister florist take my order please  
We had a silly quarrel the other day  
I hope these pretty flowers chase her blues away  
  
I want some red roses for a blue lady  
Send them to the sweetest gal in town  
And if they do the trick, I'll hurry back to pick  
Your best white orchid for her wedding gown  
  
(I want some red roses for a blue lady)  
  
We had a silly quarrel the other day  
I hope these pretty flowers chase her blues away  
  
I want some red roses for a blue, blue lady

And if they do the trick, I'll hurry back to pick  
Your best white orchid for her wedding gown

Sail along, silvery moon,  
Trail along lover's lane,  
Sail along, silvery moon,  
To my love again.  
  
In the glow of your light,  
Let me see her tonight,  
Once again, hold her tight,  
Back in lover's lane.  
  
And then the whole world wll seem brighter,  
As we stroll hand in hand,  
Two blue hearts will be lighhter,  
You understand,  
  
Sail along silvery moon,  
Trail along lover's lane,  
Sail along, silvery moon,  
To my love again.

I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way  
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday  
I called on dear old Santa Claus  
To see what I could see  
He took me to his workshop  
And told his plans to me, so  
  
[Chorus]  
You better watch out, you better not cry  
Better not pout, I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
He's making a list and checking it twice  
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
He sees you when you're sleepin'  
He knows when you're a wake  
He knows if you've been bad or good  
So be good for goodness sake  
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry  
Better not pout, I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
  
With little tin horns and little toy drums  
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo  
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee  
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree  
So! You better watch out, you better not cry  
Better not pout, I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
  
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play  
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day  
You'd better write your letter now  
And mail it right away  
Because he's getting ready  
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So  
  
[Chorus]  
  
With little tin horns and little toy drums  
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo  
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee  
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree  
So! You better watch out, you better not cry  
Better not pout, I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is comin' to town

Silver bells  
Silver bells  
It's Christmas time in the city.  
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring  
Soon it will be Christmas day  
  
City sidewalks, busy sidewalks  
Dressed in holiday style  
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas  
Children laughing, people passing  
Meeting smile after smile  
And on every street corner you hear  
  
Silver bells  
Silver bells  
It's Christmas time in the city.  
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring  
Soon it will be Christmas day  
  
Strings of street lights  
Even stop lights blink of bright red and green  
As the shoppers rush home with their treasures  
Children laughing, people passing  
Meeting smile after smile  
And above all this bustle you hear  
  
Silver bells  
Silver bells  
It's Christmas time in the city.  
Ring-a-ling hear them ring  
Soon it will be Christmas day  
Soon it will be Christmas day

Took a while to drag me out of bed,  
Aim some coffee at my head,  
Saw the clock I'm running late,  
It's an ordinary day.  
And I'm like a dog on head,  
Knock one out and then fall asleep,  
It's sad but true,  
I'd rather be with you.  
Don't you forget about me,  
When you're a celebrity,  
It will be only you and me before too long.  
So little time so much to do,  
I'd rather spend my days with you.  
So little time so much to do,  
I'd like to spend one day with you.  
And if that day is not enough,  
Maybe we can stay in touch,  
But I'm not making plans for tomorrow,  
For tomorrow nevre comes.  
Said I've been celibate for years,  
Not out of chance there's no-one here,  
See I can't get my end away,  
Another ordinary day,  
And I'd love to see a little more of you,  
Your clothes would look better on my bedroom floor...bedroom floor.  
Don't you forget about me,  
When you're a celebrity,  
I know you're busy,  
But we all need somebody - before too long.  
It's in your eyes, oooooh...  
  

There was a man  
A lonely man  
Who lost his love  
Through his indifference.  
A heart that cares  
That went unshared  
And slowly dies  
Within his silence.  
  
Chorus:  
Now solitaire's the only game in town and  
Every road that takes me takes me down,  
I find myself that's easy to pretend,  
I'll never love again and deep into myself I play the  
Game, without you love it always ends the same,  
While life goes all around me everywhere, I'm playing Solitaire.  
  
Another day a lonely day  
So much to say that goes unspoken  
And through the night  
Each sleepless night  
The eyes are closed  
The heart is broken.  
  
Chorus:  
Now Solitaire's the only game in town and  
Every road that takes me takes me down,  
I find myself that's easy to pretend I'm coming back  
Again and deep into myself I play the game without  
You love it always ends the same,  
While life goes all around me everywhere, I'm playing Solitaire.  
Solitaire's the only game in town.  
Every road that takes me takes me down.

In the cool of the evening when everything is getting kinda' groovy  
I call you up and ask "would you like to go and meet to see a movie?"  
First you say no, you've got some plans for tonight  
And then you stop, and say "alright"  
Love is kinda' crazy with a spooky little girl like you  
  
(Spooky)  
You always keep me guessin' and I never seem to know what you are thinking  
And if a fella looks at you, it's for sure your little eye will be  
A-winkin'  
I get confused, 'cause I don't know where I stand  
And then you smile, and hold my hand  
Love is kinda' crazy with a spooky little girl like you  
(Spooky)  
  
Let's dance...  
  
If you decide to stop this little game that you are playing  
I'm gonna tell you all that my heart has been dying to be sayin'  
Just like a ghost you've been hauntin' my dreams  
So I confess, on Halloweens  
Love is kinda' crazy with a spooky little girl like you  
(Spooky)

Here I stand, watching the tide go out  
So all alone and blue  
Just dreaming dreams of you  
  
I watched your ship as it sailed out to sea  
Taking all my dreams  
And taking all of me  
  
The sighing of the waves  
The wailing of the wind  
The tears in my eyes burn  
Pleading, "My love, return"  
  
Why, oh, why must I go on like this  
Shall I just be a lonely stranger on the shore  
  
The sighing of the waves  
The wailing of the wind  
The tears in my eyes burn  
Pleading, "My love, return"  
  
Why, oh, why must I go on like this  
Shall I just be a lonely stranger on the shore

Words by Marilyn and Alan Bergman, Music by Michel Legrand  
From the 1971 film, "Summer Of '42" starring Jennifer O'Neill  
Legrand won an Oscar for his score.  
  
The summer smiles, the summer knows  
And unashamed, she sheds her clothes  
The summer smoothes the restless sky  
And lovingly she warms the sand on which you lie  
The summer knows, the summer's wise  
She sees the doubts within your eyes  
And so she takes her summer time  
Tells the moon to wait and the sun to linger  
Twists the world 'round her summer finger  
Lets you see the wonder of her arms  
And if you've learned your lessons well  
There's little more for her to tell  
One last caress, it's time to dress for fall  
  
And if you've learned your lesson well  
There's little more for her to tell  
One last caress, it's time to dress for fall

Summer Love  
Who will be your summer love  
Like I was last summer  
Sharing every moment of  
Things we did last summer  
Who will be satisfied  
Just to be by your side  
Who will kiss you, hold you tight  
Two silver silhouettes  
In the summer moonlight  
Will you walk along the beach  
Like we did last summer  
Counting stars way out of reach  
Like we did last summer  
Will you tell your heart, beware  
This is just a summer affair  
Or will you fall in love for keeps  
Like I did last summer  
  

My world is like a river, as dark as it is deep  
Night after night the past slips in and gathers all my sleep  
My days are just an endless stream of emptiness to me  
Filled only by the fleeting moments of her memory  
Sweet memories, sweet memories  
M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-mm.  
She slipped into the silence of my dreams again last night  
Wandering from room to room, she's turning on each light  
Her laughter spills like water from the river to the sea  
And I'm swept away from sadness, clinging to her memory  
Sweet memories, sweet memories  
M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-mm  
Sweet memories, sweet memories  
M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-mm

Tender is the night  
So tender is the night  
There's no one in the world  
Except the two of us  
  
Should tomorrow find us disenchanted  
We have shared the love that few have known  
Summers by the sea, a sailboat in Capri  
These memories shall be our very own  
  
Even though our dreams may vanish  
With the morning light  
We loved once in splendor  
How tender, how tender the night  
  
Even though our dreams may vanish  
With the morning light  
We loved once in splendor  
How tender, how tender the night

This is the moment I've waited for  
I can hear my heart singing  
Soon bells will be ringing  
  
This is the moment of sweet aloha  
I will love you longer than forever  
Promise me that you will leave me never  
  
Here and now, dear  
All my love I vow, dear  
Promise me that you will leave me never  
I will love you longer than forever  
  
Now that we are one  
Clouds won't hide the sun  
Blue skies of hawaii smile  
On this, our wedding day  
  
(I do) I do  
(love you) love you  
With all my heart

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire  
Jack Frost nipping at your nose  
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir  
And folks dressed up like Eskimos  
  
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe  
Help to make the season bright  
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow  
Will find it hard to sleep tonight  
  
They know that Santa's on his way  
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh  
And every mother's child is gonna spy  
To see if reindeer really know how to fly  
  
And so I'm offering this simple phrase  
To kids from one to ninety two  
Although it's been said many times many ways  
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas  
Merry Christmas to you

This land is mine  
God gave this land to me  
This brave and ancient land to me  
And when the morning sun  
Reveals her hills and plains  
Then I see a land  
Where children can run free  
So take my hand  
And walk this land with me  
And walk this lovely land with me  
  
[Chorus: Repeat 2X]  
Tho' I am just a man  
When you are by my side  
With the help of God  
I know I can be strong  
  
To make this land our home  
If I must fight, I'll fight  
To make this land our own  
Until I die, this land is mine

To dream the impossible dream  
To fight the unbeatable foe  
To bear with unbearable sorrow  
To run where the brave dare not go  
  
To right the unrightable wrong  
To love pure and chaste from afar  
To try when your arms are too weary  
To reach the unreachable star  
  
This is my quest, to follow that star,  
No matter how hopeless, no matter how far  
To fight for the right without question or cause  
To be willing to march into hell for a heavenly cause  
  
And I know if I'll only be true to this glorious quest  
That my heart will lie peaceful and calm when I'm laid to my rest  
  
And the world will be better for this  
That one man scorned and covered with scars  
Still strove with his last ounce of courage  
To fight the unbeatable foe, to reach the unreachable star

The look of love is in your eyes  
A look your smile can't disguise  
The look of lo-ove is saying so much more than just words could ever say  
And what my heart has heard, well it takes my breath away  
  
I can hardly wait to hold you, feel my arms around you  
How long I have waited  
Waited just to love you, now that I have found you  
Don't ever go You've got the  
  
Look of love, it's on your face  
A look that time can't erase  
Be mine toni-ight, let this be just the start of so many nights like this  
Let's take a lover's vow and then seal it with a kiss  
  
I can hardly wait to hold you, feel my arms around you  
How long I have waited  
Waited just to love you, now that I have found you  
Don't ever go  
Don't ever go  
  
I love you so  
I love you so  
I love you so

It's the most wonderful time of the year  
With the kids jingle belling  
And everyone telling you "Be of good cheer"  
It's the most wonderful time of the year  
It's the hap-happiest season of all  
With those holiday greetings and gay happy meetings  
When friends come to call  
It's the hap- happiest season of all  
  
There'll be parties for hosting  
Marshmallows for toasting  
And caroling out in the snow  
There'll be scary ghost stories  
And tales of the glories of  
Christmases long, long ago  
  
It's the most wonderful time of the year  
There'll be much mistltoeing  
And hearts will be glowing  
When love ones are near  
It's the most wonderful time of the year  
  
There'll be parties for hosting  
Marshmallows for toasting  
And caroling out in the snow  
There'll be scary ghost stories  
And tales of the glories of  
Christmases long, long ago  
  
It's the most wonderful time of the year  
There'll be much mistltoeing  
And hearts will be glowing  
When love ones are near  
It's the most wonderful time  
It's the most wonderful time  
It's the most wonderful time  
It's the most wonderful time of the year

The very thought of you  
And I forget to do  
The little ordinary things that everyone ought to do  
I'm living in a kind of daydream  
I'm happy as a king  
And foolish though it may seem  
To me that's everything  
The mere idea of you  
The longing here for you  
You'll never know how slow the moments go  
Till I'm near to you  
I see your face in every flower  
Your eyes in stars above  
It's just the thought of you  
The very thought of you  
My love

I've traveled far, the land and the sea  
Beautiful places I happened to be  
One little town I'll never forget  
Is Lourdes, the village of St. Bernadette  
  
Ave, ave, ave Ma-ri-a  
Ave, ave, ave Ma-ri-i-ia  
  
There, like a dream, this wonderful night  
I gazed at the grotto aglow in the light  
A feeling divine swept over me there  
I fell to my knees as I whispered the prayer  
  
Ave, ave, ave Ma-ri-a  
Ave, ave, ave Ma-ri-i-ia  
  
Now I am home, I'm happy to be  
Telling of places I've traveled to see  
One little town I'll never forget  
Is Lourdes, the village of St. Bernadette  
  
Ave, ave, ave Ma-ri-a  
Ave, ave, ave Ma-ri-i-ia  
  
Ave, ave, ave Ma-ri-a  
Ave, ave, ave Ma-ri-a

Memories light the corners of my mind  
Misty water-colored memories of the way we were  
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind  
Smiles we gave to one another for the way we were  
  
Can it be that it was all so simple then  
Or has time rewritten every line  
If we had the chance to do it all again  
  
Tell me, would we?  
Could we?  
  
Memories may be beautiful and yet  
What's too painful to remember  
We simply choose to forget  
So it's the laughter we will remember  
Whenever we remember  
The way we were  
The way we were

Close your eyes, come with me  
And we soon will be  
In the wonderful world  
Of the young  
  
Hearts remain seventeen  
Dreams are evergreen  
In the wonderful world  
Of the young  
  
Fools may deny it  
Wise men know the truth  
They have discovered  
That love is youth  
  
Take this heart that I give  
And we'll always live  
In the wonderful world  
Of the young  
  
In the wonderful world  
Of the young, mmmm  
In the wonderful world  
Of the young  
  
Fools may deny it  
Wise men know the truth  
They have discovered  
That love is youth  
  
Take this heart that I give  
And we'll always live  
In the wonderful world  
Of the young

Three coins in the fountain,  
Each one seeking happiness.  
Thrown by three hopeful lovers,  
Which one will the fountain bless?  
  
Three hearts in the fountain,  
Each heart longing for its home.  
There they lie in the fountain  
Somewhere in the heart of Rome.  
  
Which one will the fountain bless?  
Which one will the fountain bless?  
  
Three coins in the fountain,  
Through the ripples how they shine.  
Just one wish will be granted,  
One heart will wear a valentine.  
  
Make it mine!  
Make it mine!  
Make it mine!  
  
Three coins in the fountain,  
Through the ripples how they shine.  
And just one wish will be granted,  
One heart will wear a valentine.  
  
Make it mine!  
Make it mine!  
Make it mine!

If I could hold you in the arms of love tonight  
I'd never let you go  
As the hours go by I'd show you why we've waited for this  
As two lovers whisper low  
  
If I could feel that magic kiss your lips invite  
Imagine the joys I'd know  
The day has died away, let's find a hideaway  
And share the promise of a new tomorrow  
In the arms of love tonight  
  
The day has died away, let's find a hideaway  
And share the promise of a new tomorrow  
In the arms of love tonight  
  
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm  
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm

Tonight, tonight, won't be just any night,  
Tonight there will be no morning star  
Tonight, tonight, I'll see my love tonight.  
And for us, stars will stop where they are.  
  
Today the minutes seem like hours,  
The hours go so slowly,  
And still the sky is light  
  
Oh moon, grow bright,  
And make this endless day endless night!  
Tonight  
  
Today, the world was just an address  
A place for me to live in  
No better than alright  
  
But here you are,  
and what was just a world is a star  
Tonight  

Heavenly shades of night are falling, it's twilight time  
Out of the mist your voice is calling, it's twilight time  
When purple-colored curtains mark the end of day  
I'll hear you, my dear, at twilight time  
  
Deepening shadows gather splendor as day is done  
Fingers of night will soon surrender the setting sun  
I count the moments darling till you're here with me  
Together at last at twilight time  
  
Here, in the afterglow of day, we keep our rendezvous beneath the blue  
Here in the sweet and same old way I fall in love again as I did then  
  
Deep in the dark your kiss will thrill me like days of old  
Lighting the spark of love that fills me with dreams untold  
Each day I pray for evening just to be with you  
Together at last at twilight time  
  
Here, in the afterglow of day, we keep our rendezvous beneath the blue  
Here in the sweet and same old way I fall in love again as I did then  
  
Deep in the dark your kiss will thrill me like days of old  
Lighting the spark of love that fills me with dreams untold  
Each day I pray for evening just to be with you  
Together at last at twilight time  
Together at last at twilight time

Oh, my love, my darling  
I've hungered for your touch a long, lonely time  
Time goes by so slowly  
And time can do so much  
Are you still mine?  
I need your love, I need your love  
God speed your love to me  
Lonely rivers flow to the sea, to the sea  
To the open arms of the sea  
Lonely rivers sigh, "Wait for me, wait for me  
I'll be coming home, wait for me"  
Are you still mine?  
I need your love, I need your love  
God speed your love to me  

If I am dreaming you've got your arms around me,  
Wake me when it's over.  
Wake me when it's over, not before.  
  
And if I'm dreaming that love at last has found me,  
Let me go on dreaming.  
Wake me when it's over and then let me go to sleep, again.  
  
It's hard to believe, my dear, that you're here at all.  
Incredible, I pinch myself, you don't disappear at all.  
So if I'm hearing you tell some small-town justice, you will not forsake me.  
Takin' vows to make me yours, ever more.  
Then darling, wake me when it's over, and not before.  
  
Oh, wake me when it's over.  
Wake me when it's over, and then back to sleep again.  
  
It's hard to believe, my dear, that you're here at all.  
Incredible, you don't disappear at all.  
So, tell that small-town justice you'll take me.  
Tell I'm you'll make me yours ever more.  
Then darling, wake me when it's over, not before!

Let someone start believing in you  
Let him hold out his hand  
Let him touch you and watch what happens  
One someone who can look in your eyes  
  
And see into your heart  
Let him find you and watch what happens  
Cold, no I won't believe your heart is cold  
Maybe just afraid to be broken again  
  
Let someone with a deep love to give  
Give that deep love to you  
And what magic you'll see  
Let someone with a deep love to give  
  
Give that deep love to you  
And what magic you'll see  
Let someone give his heart  
Someone who cares like me  
  
Let someone give his heart who cares like me  
As sung by johnny mathis:  
Cold, no, I can't believe your heart is cold  
Maybe slow to warm from a long, lonely night  
  
Let someone start believing in you  
Let him hold out his hand  
Let him touch you and watch what happens  
One someone who can look in your eyes  
  
And see into your heart  
Let him find you and watch what happens  
Cold, no, I won't believe your heart is cold  
Maybe just afraid to be broken again  
  
Let someone with a deep love to give  
Give that deep love to you  
And what magic you'll see  
Let someone give his heart  
  
Someone who cares like me

What now, my love  
Now that you've left me  
How can I live  
Through another day  
Watching my dreams  
Turn into ashes  
And my hopes  
Into bits of clay  
Once I could see  
Once I could feel  
Now I am numb  
I've become unreal  
I walk the night  
Oh without a goal  
Stripped of my heart  
And my soul  
What now, my love  
Now that it's over  
I feel the world  
Closing in on me  
Here come the stars  
Tumbling around me  
And there's the sky  
Where the sea should be  
What now, my love  
Now that you're gone  
I'd be a fool  
To go on and on  
No one would care  
No one would cry  
If I should live  
If I should die  
What now, my love  
Now there is nothing  
Only my last goodbye  
Only my last  
My last goodbye

When I look in your eyes  
I see the wisdom of the world in your eyes  
I see the sadness of a thousand goodbyes  
When I look in your eyes  
And it is no surprise  
To see the softness of the moon in your eyes  
The gentle sparkle of the stars in the skies  
When I look in your eyes  
In your eyes  
I see the deepness of the sea  
I see the deepness of the love  
The love I feel you feel for me  
Autumn comes, summer dies  
I see the passing of the years in your eyes  
And when we part there'll be not tears, no good-byes  
I'll just look into your eyes  
In your eyes  
I see the deepness of the sea  
I see the deepness of the love  
The love I feel you feel for me  
Autumn comes, summer dies  
I see the passing of the years in your eyes  
And when we part there'll be not tears, no good-byes  
I'll just look into your eyes  
Those eyes so wise, so warm, so real  
How I love the world your eyes reveal

No, I can't forget this evening  
Or your face as you were leaving  
But I guess that's just the way the story goes  
You always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows  
Yes, it shows  
  
No, I can't forget tomorrow  
When I think of all my sorrows  
When I had you there but then I let you go  
And now it's only fair that I should let you know  
What you should know  
  
I can't live if living is without you  
I can't live, I can't give anymore  
Can't live if living is without you  
I can't give, I can't give anymore  
  
Well, I can't forget this evening  
Or your face as you were leaving  
But I guess that's just the way the story goes  
You always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows  
Yes, it shows  
  
I can't live if living is without you  
I can't live, I can't give anymore  
I can't live if living is without you  
I can't live, I can't give anymore  
(Living is without you)

The other night dear as I lay sleeping  
I dreamed I held you in my arms  
When I awoke, dear, I was mistaken  
So I hung my head and I cried  
  
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine  
You make me happy when skies are gray  
You'll never know dear, how much I love you  
Please don't take my sunshine away  
  
I'll always love you and make you happy  
If you will only say the same  
But if you leave me to love another  
You'll regret it all some day  
  
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine  
You make me happy when skies are gray  
You'll never know dear, how much I love you  
Please don't take my sunshine away  
  
You told me once, dear, you really loved me  
And no one else could come between  
But now you've left me and love another  
You have shattered all my dreams  
  
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine  
You make me happy when skies are gray  
You'll never know dear, how much I love you  
Please don't take my sunshine away

There's a certain sound always follows me around When you're close to me you
will hear it It's the sound that lovers hear when they discover There could be
no other for their love It's my happy heart you hear Singing loud and singing
clear And it's all because you're near me, my love Take my happy heart away
Let me love you night and day In your arms I wanna stay, oh my love Feeling
more and more like I've never felt before You have changed my life so
completely Music fills my soul now, I've lost all control now I'm not half,
I'm whole now with your love It's my happy heart you hear Singing loud and
singing clear And it's all because you're near me, my love Take my happy heart
away Let me love you night and day In your arms I wanna stay, oh my love It's
my happy heart you hear Singing loud and singing clear And it's all because
you're near me, my love Take my happy heart away Let me love you night and day
In your arms I wanna stay, oh my love It's my happy heart you hear Singing
loud and singing clear And it's all because you're near me, my love Take my
happy heart away Let me love you night and day In your arms I wanna stay, oh
my love

It's a little bit funny this feeling inside  
I'm not one of those who can easily hide  
I don't have much money but boy if I did  
I'd buy a big house where we both could live  
  
If I was a sculptor, but then again, no  
Or a man who makes potions in a travelling show  
I know it's not much but it's the best I can do  
My gift is my song and this one's for you  
  
And you can tell everybody this is your song  
It may be quite simple but now that it's done  
I hope you don't mind  
I hope you don't mind that I put down in words  
How wonderful life is while you're in the world  
  
I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss  
Well a few of the verses well they've got me quite cross  
But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song  
It's for people like you that keep it turned on  
  
So excuse me forgetting but these things I do  
You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue  
Anyway the thing is what I really mean  
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen
