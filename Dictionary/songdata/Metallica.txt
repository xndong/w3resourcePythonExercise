Ooooh  
Run away, the past will bite again  
Ooooh  
No matter where you dwell  
You  
Here again, a captive of the howl  
You  
Welcome back to hell  
  
Faithful, as the full moon is rising  
Beauty and the Beast are colliding  
  
Sharpened edge touch liquid flame  
Deepened seed soaks anger's reign  
Arching back, shape-shift derange  
Father, how I watched you change  
  
Am I savage?  
Scratching at the door  
Am I savage?  
I don't recognize you anymore  
  
Ooooh  
Tooth is fang, twisting under skin  
Ooooh  
Foul tongue, black breath  
Change  
Snap inside, the Beast about complete  
Change  
Soon infects the rest  
  
Faithful, as the full moon is rising  
Beauty and the Beast are colliding  
  
Sharpened edge touch liquid flame  
Deepened seed soaks anger's reign  
Arching back, shape-shift derange  
Father, how I watched you change  
  
Am I savage?  
Howling at the door  
Am I savage?  
I don't recognize you anymore  
Anymore  
  
Ooooh  
Inheritance, the past has bit again  
Ooooh  
The next heir of anarchy  
Feel  
Stretching skin so far beyond belief  
I feel  
The ever changing, you, in me  
  
Am I savage?  
Scratching at the door  
Am I savage?  
Howling evermore  
Am I savage?  
I don't recognize me anymore  
Anymore  
  
Anymore, ha ha ha  
Am I savage?

Halls of justice painted green  
Money talking  
Power wolves beset your door  
Hear them stalking  
Soon you'll please their appetite  
They devour  
Hammer of justice crushes you  
Overpower  
  
The ultimate in vanity  
Exploiting their supremacy  
I can't believe the things you say  
I can't believe  
I can't believe the price you pay  
Nothing can save you  
  
Justice is lost  
Justice is raped  
Justice is gone  
Pulling your strings  
Justice is done  
Seeking no truth  
Winning is all  
Find it so grim  
So true  
So real  
  
Apathy their stepping stone  
So unfeeling  
Hidden deep animosity  
So deceiving  
Through your eyes their light burns  
Hoping to find  
Inquisition sinking you  
With prying minds  
  
The ultimate in vanity  
Exploiting their supremacy  
I can't believe the things you say  
I can't believe  
I can't believe the price you pay  
Nothing can save you  
  
Justice is lost  
Justice is raped  
Justice is gone  
Pulling your strings  
Justice is done  
Seeking no truth  
Winning is all  
Find it so grim  
So true  
So real  
  
Lady justice has been raped  
Truth assassin  
Rolls of red tape seal your lips  
Now you're done in  
Their money tips her scales again  
Make your deal  
Just what is truth?I cannot tell  
Cannot feel  
  
The ultimate in vanity  
Exploiting their supremacy  
I can't believe the things you say  
I can't believe  
I can't believe the price we pay  
Nothing can save you  
  
Justice is lost  
Justice is raped  
Justice is gone  
Pulling your strings  
Justice is done  
Seeking no truth  
Winning is all  
Find it so grim  
So true  
So real  
Seeking no truth  
Winning is all  
Find it so grim  
So true  
So real

Clock strikes twelve and moon drops burst  
Out at you from their hiding place  
Like acid and oil on a madman's face  
His reasons tend to fly away  
Like lesser birds on the four winds, yeah  
Like silver scrapes in May  
Now the sands become a crust  
And most of you have gone away (hm, yeah gone away)  
  
Come Susy dear, let's take a walk  
Just out there upon the beach  
I know you'll soon be married  
And you want to know where the winds come from  
Well it's never said at all  
On the map that Carrie reads  
Behind the clock back there you know  
At the four winds bar (hm, yeah)  
  
Hey, hey, hey, hey  
Four winds at the four winds bar  
Two doors locked and windows barred  
One door let to take you in  
The other one just mirrors it  
Hey, hey, yeah! hey, hey  
In hellish glare and inference  
The other one's a duplicate  
The queenly flux, eternal light  
Or the light that never warms  
Yes the light, that never, never warms  
Yes the light, that never, never warms  
Never warms, never warms  
  
The clock strikes twelve and moon drops burst  
Out at you from their hiding place  
Miss Carrie nurse and Suzy dear  
Would find themselves at the four winds bar  
It's the nexus of the crisis  
The origin of storms  
Just the place to hopelessly  
Encounter time and then came me  
  
Hey, hey, hey, hey  
  
Call me Desdenova, eternal light  
These gravely digs of mine  
Will surely prove a sight  
And don't forget my dog, fixed and consequent  
  
Astronomy, a star  
Astronomy, a star  
Astronomy, a star  
Astronomy, a star

[Verse 1]  
Bitterness and burden  
Curses rest on thee  
Solitaire and sorrow  
All eternity  
Save the Earth and claim perfection  
Deem the mass and blame rejection  
Hold the pose, fein perception  
Grudges break your back  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
All you bear  
All you carry  
All you bear  
Place it right on  
Right on me  
  
[Chorus]  
Die as you suffer in vain  
Own all the grief and the pain  
Die as you hold up the skies  
Atlas, rise!  
How does it feel on your own?  
Bound by the world all alone  
Crushed under heavy skies  
Atlas, rise!  
  
[Verse 2]  
Crucify and witness  
Circling the sun  
Bastardized in ruin  
What have you become?  
Blame the world and blame your maker  
Wish 'em to the undertaker  
Crown yourself the other savior  
So you carry on  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
All you bear  
All you carry  
All you bear  
Place it right on  
Right on me  
  
[Chorus]  
Die as you suffer in vain  
Own all the grief and the pain  
Die as you hold up the skies  
Atlas, rise!  
How does it feel on your own?  
Bound by the world all alone  
Crushed under heavy skies  
Crushed under heavy skies  
Atlas, rise!  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
[Verse 3]  
Masquerade as maker  
Heavy is the crown  
Beaten down and broken  
Drama wears you down  
Overload, the martyr stumbles  
Hit the ground and Heaven crumbles  
All alone the fear shall humble  
Swallow all your pride  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
All you bear  
All you carry  
All you bear  
Place it right on  
Right on me  
  
[Chorus]  
Die as you suffer in vain  
Own all the grief and the pain  
Die as you hold up the skies  
Atlas, rise!  
How does it feel on your own?  
Bound by the world all alone  
Crushed under heavy skies  
Crushed under heavy skies  
Atlas, rise!

Suppose I say  
I'm never satisfied  
Suppose I say

To make the tree survive

Gone, gone again

I look at you then you me  
Hungry and thirsty I wait  
Holding the lion's share  
Holding the key  
Holding me back 'cause I'm striving to be  
Better than you (better than you)  
Better than you (better than you)  
Lock homes I push and I strive  
Somehow I feel more alive  
Bury the deep forest  
Bury the sea  
Bury me deep when there's no will to be  
Better than you (better than you)  
Oh better than you (better than you)  
Oh, can't stop this train from rolling  
Oh, yo, nothing brings me down  
No, can't stop this train from rolling on and on, on  
No, no, forever on and on  
Oh, can't stop this train from rolling  
Oh, yo, you can't take it down  
No, never stop this locomotion on and on and on  
No, no, you can't bring me down 'cause I'm  
Better than you (better than you)

Blackened is the end  
Winter it will send  
Throwing all you see  
Into obscurity  
Death of mother earth  
Never a rebirth  
Evolution's end  
Never will it mend  
Never  
  
Fire  
To begin whipping dance of the dead  
Blackened is the end  
To begin whipping dance of the dead  
Color our world blackened  
  
Blistering of earth  
Terminate its worth  
Deadly nicotine  
Kills what might have been  
Callous frigid chill  
Nothing left to kill  
Never seen before  
Breathing nevermore  
Never  
  
Fire  
To begin whipping dance of the dead  
Blackened is the end  
To begin whipping dance of the dead  
Color our world blackened  
  
Blackened  
  
Opposition...contradiction...premonition...compromise  
Agitation...violation...mutilation...planet dies  
Darkest color  
Blistered earth  
True death of life  
Termination....expiration...cancellation...human race  
Expectation...liberation...population...lay to waste  
See our mother  
Put to death  
See our mother die  
Smoldering decay  
Take her breath away  
Millions of our years  
In minutes disappears  
Darkening in vain  
Decadence remains  
All is said and done  
Never is the sun  
Never  
  
Fire  
To begin whipping dance of the dead  
Blackened is the end  
To begin whipping dance of the dead  
Fire  
Is the outcome of hypocrisy  
Darkest potency  
In the exit of humanity  
Color our world blackened  
Blackened

I'm digging my way  
I'm digging my way to something  
I'm digging my way to something better  
  
I'm pushing to stay  
I'm pushing to stay with something  
I'm pushing to stay with something better  
  
I'm sowing the seeds  
I'm sowing the seeds I've taken  
I'm sowing the seeds I take for granted  
  
This thorn in my side  
This thorn in my side is from the tree  
This thorn in my side is from the tree I've planted  
  
It tears me and I bleed  
And I bleed  
  
Caught under wheels' roll  
I take the leech, I'm bleeding me  
Can't stop to save my soul  
I take the leash that's leading me  
I'm bleeding me  
I can't take it  
Caught under wheels' roll  
The bleeding of me  
Of me  
The bleeding of me  
  
I am the beast that feeds the feast  
I am the blood, I am release  
  
Come make me pure  
Bleed me a cure  
I'm caught, I'm caught, I'm caught under  
  
Caught under wheels' roll  
I take that leech, I'm bleeding me  
Can't stop to save my soul  
I take the leash that's leading me  
I'm bleeding me  
I can't take it  
I can't take it  
I can't take it  
The bleeding of me  
  
I'm digging my way  
I'm digging my way to something  
I'm digging my way to something better  
  
I'm pushing to stay  
I'm pushing to stay with something  
I'm pushing to stay with something better  
With something better

(Originally recorded by Blitzkrieg)  
  
Let us have peace, let us have life  
Let us escape the cruel night  
Let us have time, let the sun shine  
Let us beware the deadly sign  
  
The day is coming  
Armageddon's near  
Inferno's coming  
Can we survive the blitzkrieg?  
The blitzkrieg  
The blitzkrieg  
  
Save us from fate, save us from hate  
Save ourselves before it's too late  
Come to our need, hear our plea  
Save ourselves before the earth bleeds  
  
The day is dawning  
The time is near  
Aliens calling  
Can we survive the blitzkrieg?  
  
Haha  
  
[Burp!  
Hahaha  
I fucked up one place]

Why do you cheat on me  
Why do I cheat on thee

Let the wick recede and break  
Let the starlight radiate

Wake to face the day  
Grab this life and walk away  
War is never done  
Rub the patch and battle on  
Make it go away  
Please, make it go away  
  
Confusion  
All sanity is now beyond me  
Delusion  
All sanity is but a memory  
My life, the war that never ends  
  
Leave the battlefield  
Yet its horrors never heal  
Coming home from war  
Pieces don't fit anymore  
Make it go away  
Please, make it go away  
  
Confusion  
All sanity is now beyond me  
Delusion  
All sanity is but a memory  
My life, the war that never ends  
  
Father, please come home  
Shell shocked all I've known  
Father, please come home  
  
Label him a deadwood soldier now  
Cast away and left to roam  
Rapid is the road to sacrifice  
Just takes longer to come home  
Come home  
  
Confusion  
All sanity is now beyond me  
Delusion  
Crossfire ricochets inside me  
Trapped in a memory forever  
My life, the war that never ends

Show to me in surgery  
The art of fighting words to conquer life  
Conquer life, yeah

Is driving from my heady mountain brain  
Crash course in brain surgery  
Has stopped the bloody knife of words again  
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah it's got to get better than this, this, this  
It must get better than this  
Betting on the cure  
Everyone's gotta to have the sickness  
'Cause everyone seems to need the cure  
  
I do believe

Sleep and dream of this  
Death angel's kiss  
Brings final bliss  
Don't believe it!  
  
Empty they say  
Death, won't you let me stay?  
Empty they say  
Death, hear me call your name?  
Oh, call your name!  
Suicide, I've already died  
It's just the funeral I've been waiting for  
Cyanide, living dead inside  
Break this empty shell forevermore  
  
Wait, wait patiently  
Your death-black wings  
Unfolding sleep  
Treading on me  
  
Empty they say  
Death, won't you let me stay?  
Empty they say  
Death, hear me call your name  
Oh, call your name!  
Suicide, I've already died  
It's just the funeral I've been waiting for  
Cyanide, living dead inside  
Break this empty shell forevermore  
  
Say, is that rain or are they tears?  
That stained your concrete face for years  
Crying, weeping, shedding strife  
Year after year, life after life  
A narrow freshly broken ground  
A concrete angel laid right down  
Upon the moon that swallows fast  
It's peace at last  
Oh, peace at last  
  
Empty they say  
Death, won't you let me stay?  
Empty they say  
Death, hear me call your name  
Oh, call your name  
Suicide, I've already died  
It's just the funeral I've been waiting for  
Cyanide, living dead inside  
Break this empty shell forevermore  
  
Forevermore!  
Forevermore!  
It's the funeral I've been waiting for!

Hey babe don't act so scared  
All I want is some special care  
I'm on the run from some institution  
All I want's a little consolation  
And I can tell by your face  
I'm a total disgrace  
Let me inside your place  
Move over for a damage case  
  
Hey babe wait a minute stop  
Don't run away don't call the cop  
I ain't looking to victimize you  
All I want to do is tantalize you  
And I can tell by your state  
I'm all over the place  
I can tell by your face  
Got no time for a damage case  
  
Hey babe don't turn away  
I'm here tomorrow I'm gone today  
I don't care what you think your game is  
I don't care even what your name is  
And I can tell by your face  
You're all over this place  
Let me inside your face  
Move over for a damage case

Dealing out the agony within  
Charging hard and no one's gonna give in  
Living on your knees, conformity  
Or dying on your feet for honesty  
Inbred, our bodies work as one  
Bloody, but never cry submission  
Following our instinct not a trend  
Go against the grain until the end  
  
[Chorus:]  
Blood will follow blood  
Dying time is here  
Damage Incorporated  
  
Slamming through, don't fuck with razorback  
Stepping out? You'll feel our hell on your back  
Blood follows blood and we make sure  
Life ain't for you and we're the cure  
Honesty is my only excuse  
Try to rob us of it, but it's no use  
Steamroller action crushing all  
Victim is your name and you shall fall  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We chew and spit you out  
We laugh, you scream and shout  
All flee, with fear you run  
You'll know just where we come from  
Damage Incorporated  
Damage jackals ripping right through you  
Sight and smell of this, it gets me goin'  
Know just how to get just what we want  
Tear it from your soul in nightly hunt  
Fuck it all and fucking no regrets  
Never happy ending on these dark sets  
All's fair for Damage Inc. you see  
Step a little closer if you please  
  
[Chorus]

Yeah  
I feel you too  
Feel  
Those things you do  
In your eyes I see a fire that burns  
To free the you  
That's running through  
Deep inside you know  
Seeds I plant will grow  
One day you will see  
And dare to come down to me  
Yeah come on come on now take the chance  
That's right  
Let's dance  
Snake  
I am the snake  
Tempting  
That bite you take  
Let me make your mind  
Leave yourself behind  
Be not afraid  
I've got what you need  
Hunger I will feed  
One day you will see  
And dare to come down to me  
Yeah, come on, come on now take the chance  
Haha  
Come dance  
Yeah, come dancing  
One day you will see  
And dare to come down to me  
Yeah, come on, come on now take the chance  
Yeah  
I feel you too  
Feel  
Those things you do  
In your eyes I see a fire that burns  
To free the you  
That's running through  
Deep inside you know  
Seeds I plant will grow  
One day you will see  
And dare to come down to me  
Yeah, come on, come on now take the chance  
That's right  
Let's dance  
Mm, it's nice to see you here  
Haha

Die, die, die my darling  
Don't utter a single word  
Die, die, die my darling  
Just shut your pretty eyes  
I'll be seeing you again  
Yeah, I'll be seeing you in hell  
  
So don't cry to me oh baby  
Your future's in an oblong box  
Don't cry to me oh baby  
You should have seen it a-comin' on  
Don't cry to me oh baby  
Had to know it was in your cards  
Don't cry to me oh baby  
Dead-end goal for a dead-end girl  
Don't cry to me oh baby  
And now your life drains on that floor  
Don't cry to me oh baby  
  
Die, die, die my darling  
Don't utter a single word  
Die, die, die my darling  
Just shut your pretty mouth  
I'll be seeing you again  
I'll be seeing you in hell  
  
Don't cry to me oh baby  
Your future's in an oblong box  
Don't cry to me oh baby  
You should have seen it a-comin' on  
Don't cry to me oh baby  
Had to know it was in your power  
Don't cry to me oh baby  
Dead-end goal for a dead-end girl  
Don't cry to me oh baby  
Now your life drains on that floor  
Don't cry to me oh baby  
  
Die, die, die my darling  
Don't utter a single word  
Die, die, die my darling  
Shut your pretty mouth  
I'll be seeing you again  
I'll be seeing you in hell  
Die, die, die  
Die, die, die  
Die, die, die  
Die

I see my reflection in the window  
It looks different, so different than what you see  
Projecting judgment on the world  
This house is clean baby  
This house is clean  
  
Am I who I think I am?  
Am I who I think I am?  
Am I who I think I am?  
Look out my window and see it's gone wrong  
Court is in session and I slam my gavel down  
  
I'm judge and I'm jury and I'm executioner too

Bodies fill the fields I see, hungry heroes end  
No one to play soldier now, no one to pretend  
Running blind through killing fields, bred to kill them all  
Victim of what said should be  
A servant 'til I fall  
  
Soldier boy, made of clay  
Now an empty shell  
Twenty one, only son  
But he served his will  
Bred to kill, not to care  
Do just as we say  
Finished here, greetings death  
He's yours to take away  
  
Back to the front  
You will do what I say, when I say  
Back to the front  
You will die when I say, you must die  
Back to the front  
You coward  
You servant  
You blind man  
  
Barking of machine gun fire, does nothing to me now  
Sounding of the clock that ticks, get used to it somehow  
More a man, more stripes you bare, glory seeker trends  
Bodies fill the fields I see  
The slaughter never ends  
  
Soldier boy, made of clay  
Now an empty shell  
Twenty one, only son  
But he served us well  
Bred to kill, not to care  
Do just as we say  
Finished here, greetings death  
He's yours to take away  
  
Back to the front  
You will do what I say, when I say  
Back to the front  
You will die when I say, you must die  
Back to the front  
You coward  
You servant  
You blind man  
  
Why, am I dying?  
Kill, have no fear  
Lie, live off lying  
Hell, hell is here  
  
I was born for dying  
  
Life planned out before my birth, nothing could I say  
Had no chance to see myself, molded day by day  
Looking back I realize, nothing have I done  
Left to die with only friend  
Alone I clench my gun  
  
Soldier boy, made of clay  
Now an empty shell  
Twenty one, only son  
But he served his will  
Bred to kill, not to care  
Do just as we say  
Finished here, greetings death  
He's yours to take away  
  
Back to the front  
You will do what I say, when I say  
Back to the front  
You will die when I say, you must die  
Back to the front  
You coward  
You servant  
You blind man  
  
Back to the front

Liberty or death, what we so proudly hail  
Once you provoke her, rattling of her tail  
Never begins it, never, but once engaged  
Never surrenders, showing the fangs of rage  
Don't tread on me  
  
So be it  
Threaten no more  
To secure peace is to prepare for war  
So be it  
Settle the score  
Touch me again for the words that you'll hear evermore  
Don't tread on me  
  
Love it or leave it, she with the deadly bite  
Quick is the blue tongue, forked as lighting strike  
Shining with brightness, always on surveillance  
The eyes, they never close, emblem of vigilance  
Don't tread on me  
  
So be it  
Threaten no more  
To secure peace is to prepare for war  
So be it  
Settle the score  
Touch me again for the words that you'll hear evermore  
  
Don't tread on me  
So be it  
Threaten no more  
To secure peace is to prepare for war  
Liberty or death, what we so proudly hail  
Once you provoke her, rattling on her tail  
  
So be it  
Threaten no more  
To secure peace is to prepare for war  
So be it  
Settle the score  
Touch me again for the words that you'll hear evermore  
Don't tread on me

He sleeps under black seas waiting  
Lies dreaming in death  
He sleeps under cosmos shaking  
Stars granting his breath  
  
He wakes as the world dies screaming  
All horrors arrive  
He wakes giving earth its bleeding  
Pure madness alive  
  
And He haunts you  
And He blinds your soul  
And He loathes you  
And reclaims it all  
  
You turn to stone  
Can't look away  
You turn to stone  
Madness, they say  
  
Cthulhu awaken  
  
He sways in abyss returning  
Inhaling black skies  
He shakes with a torture burning  
All lost in his eyes  
  
And He haunts you  
And He blinds your soul  
And He loathes you  
And reclaims it all  
  
You turn to stone  
Can't look away  
You turn to stone  
Madness, they say  
  
Cthulhu awaken  
  
You turn to stone  
Can't look away  
You turn to stone  
Madness, they say  
  
Sanity taken  
Seething damnation  
Cthulhu awaken  
(Wake) Winged Salvation  
Death by creation  
Cthulhu, awaken  
(Wake) Dreaming no more  
  
Cthulhu, awaken  
(Wake) Dreaming no more  
Cthulhu, awaken  
(Wake) Dreaming no more

Dear mother  
Dear father  
What is this hell you have put me through  
Believer  
Deceiver  
Day in day out live my life through you  
Pushed onto me what's wrong or right  
Hidden from this thing that they call life  
  
Dear mother  
Dear father  
Every thought I'd think you'd disapprove  
Curator  
Dictator  
Always censoring my every move  
Children are seen but are not heard  
Tear out everything inspired  
  
Innocence  
Torn from me without your shelter  
Barred reality  
I'm living blindly  
  
Dear mother  
Dear father  
Time has frozen still what's left to be  
Hear nothing  
Say nothing  
Cannot face the fact I think for me  
No guarantee, it's life as is  
But damn you for not giving me my chance  
  
Dear mother  
Dear father  
You've clipped my wings before I learned to fly unspoiled  
Unspoken  
I've outgrown that fucking lullaby  
Same thing I've always heard from you  
Do as I say not as I do  
  
Innocence  
Torn from me without your shelter  
Barred reality  
I'm living blindly  
  
I'm in hell without you  
Cannot cope without you two  
Shocked at the world that I see  
Innocent victim please rescue me  
  
Dear mother  
Dear father  
Hidden in your world you've made for me  
I'm seething  
I'm bleeding  
Ripping wounds in me that never heal  
Undying spite I feel for you  
Living out this hell you always knew

Say your prayers little one  
Don't forget, my son  
To include everyone  
  
Tuck you in, warm within  
Keep you free from sin  
Till the sandman he comes  
  
Sleep with one eye open  
Gripping your pillow tight  
  
Exit, light  
Enter, night  
Take my hand  
We're off to never-never land  
  
Somethings wrong, shut the light  
Heavy thoughts tonight  
And they aren't of Snow White  
Dreams of war, dreams of liars  
Dreams of dragon's fire  
And of things that will bite  
  
Sleep with one eye open  
Gripping your pillow tight  
  
Exit, light  
Enter, night  
Take my hand  
We're off to never-never land  
  
Now I lay me down to sleep  
'Now I lay me down to sleep'  
I pray the Lord my soul to keep  
'I pray the Lord my soul to keep'  
If I die before I wake  
'If I die before I wake'  
I pray the lord my soul to take  
'I pray the lord my soul to take'  
  
Hush little baby, don't say a word  
And never mind that noise you heard  
It's just the beasts under your bed  
In your closet, in your head  
  
Exit, light  
Enter, night  
Grain of sand  
  
Exit, light  
Enter, night  
Take my hand  
We're off to never-never land  
  
Ooh yeah, Yeah!  
  
We're off to never-never land  
Take my hand  
We're off to never-never land  
Take my hand.

Do you see what I see?  
Truth is an offense  
You silence for your confidence  
Do you hear what I hear?  
Doors are slamming shut  
Limit your imagination, keep you where they must  
Do you feel what I feel?  
Bittering distress  
Who decides what you express  
Do you take what I take?  
Endurance is the word  
Moving back instead of forward seems to me absurd  
  
Doesn't matter what you see?  
Or intuit what you read  
You can do it your own way  
If it's done just how I say  
  
Independence limited  
Freedom of choice  
Choice is mad for you my friend  
Freedom of speech  
Speech is words that they will bend  
Freedom with their exception  
  
Do you fear what I fear?  
Living properly  
Truths to you are lies to me  
Do you choose what I choose?  
More alternatives  
Energy derives from both the plus and negative  
Do you need what I need?  
Boundaries overthrown  
Look inside to each his own  
Do you trust what I trust?  
Me, myself and I  
Penetrate the smoke screen I see through the selfish lie  
  
Doesn't matter what you see  
Or intuit what you read  
You can do it your own way  
If it's done just how I say  
  
Independence limited  
Freedom of choice  
Choice is mad for you my friend  
Freedom of speech  
Speech is words that they will bend  
Freedom with their exception  
  
Do you know what I know?  
Your money end your wealth  
Your silence just to hear your self  
Do you want what I want?  
Desire not a thing  
I hunger after independence lengthen freedom's ring  
  
Doesn't matter what you see  
Or intuit what you read  
You can do it your own way  
If it's done just how I say  
  
Independence limited  
Freedom of choice  
Choice is mad for you my friend  
Freedom of speech  
Speech is words that they will bend  
Freedom no longer frees you  
  
Doesn't matter what you see  
Or intuit what you read  
You can do it your own way  
If it's done just how I say

Life it seems will fade away  
Drifting further everyday  
Getting lost within myself  
Nothing matters no one else  
I have lost the will to live  
Simply nothing more to give  
There is nothing more for me  
Need the end to set me free  
  
Things not what they used to be  
Missing one inside of me  
Deathly loss this can't be real  
Can't stand this hell I feel  
Emptiness is filling me  
To the point of agony  
Growing darkness taking dawn  
I was me but now, he's gone  
  
No one but me can save myself, but it's too late  
Now I can't think, think why I should even try  
  
Yesterday seems as though it never existed  
Death greets me warm, now I will just say goodbye  
Goodbye

Do unto others as they have done unto you  
But what in the hell is this world coming to?  
  
Blow the universe into nothingness  
Nuclear warfare shall lay us to rest  
  
Fight fire with fire  
Ending is near  
Fight fire with fire  
Bursting with fear  
  
We shall die  
Time is like a fuse, short and burning fast  
Armageddon is here, like said in the past  
  
Fight fire with fire  
Ending is near  
Fight fire with fire  
Bursting with fear  
  
Soon to fill our lungs the hot winds of death  
The gods are laughing, so take your last breath  
  
Fight fire with fire  
Ending is near  
Fight fire with fire  
Bursting with fear  
  
Fight fire with fire

Make his fight on the hill in the early day  
Constant chill deep inside  
Shooting gun, on they run through the endless grey  
On they fight, for the right, yes, but who's to say?  
For a hill men would kill, why? They do not know  
Suffered wounds test their pride  
Men of five, still alive through the raging glow  
Gone insane from the pain that they surely know  
  
For whom the bell tolls  
Time marches on  
For whom the bell tolls  
  
Take a look to the sky just before you die  
It is the last time he will  
Blackened claw massive roar fills the crumbling sky  
Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry  
Stranger now, are his eyes, to this mystery  
He hears the silence so loud  
Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be  
Now they see what will be, blinded eyes to see  
  
For whom the bell tolls  
Time marches on  
For whom the bell tolls

Obey, obey  
Come won't you stay  
Sincere, sincere  
All ends in tears  
Endure, endure  
Thoughts most impure  
Concede, concede  
But both shall we bleed  
  
Oh, Halo on fire  
The midnight knows it well  
Fast, is desire  
Creates another hell  
I fear to turn on the light  
For the darkness won't go away  
Fast, is desire  
Turn out the light  
Halo on fire  
  
Allure, allure  
Sweetness obscure  
Abide, abide  
Secrets inside  
Deprive, deprive  
To feel so alive  
Obey, obey  
Just don't turn away  
  
Oh, Halo on fire  
The midnight knows it well  
Fast, is desire  
Creates another hell  
I fear to turn on the light  
For the darkness won't go away  
Fast, is desire  
Turn out the light  
Halo on fire  
  
Prayers cannot get through  
Return to sender  
Unto which of you  
Shall I surrender  
Twisting in disguise  
Dark resurrection  
Lighting up the skies  
Wicked perfection  
  
Too dark to sleep  
Can't slip away  
Open or close  
My eyes betray  
Beyond the black  
Come won't you stay  
  
Hello darkness, say goodbye  
Hello darkness, say goodbye  
Hello darkness, say goodbye

Little grave I'm grieving, I will mend you  
Sweet revenge I'm dreaming, I will end you  
  
I've been here since dawn of time  
Countless hatreds built my shrine  
I was born in anger's flame  
He was Abel, I was Cain  
I am here  
I'm hell unbound  
Burn your kingdom to the ground  
To the ground  
  
Here comes revenge, just for you  
Revenge, you can't undo  
Revenge, it's killing me  
Revenge, set me free  
Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth  
A life for a life, it's my burden of proof  
Revenge, just for you  
Revenge  
You ask forgiveness, I give you sweet revenge  
  
I return this nightmare, I will find you  
Sleepless, cloaked in despair, I'm behind you  
  
Man has made me oh so strong  
Blurring lines of right and wrong  
Far too late for frail amends  
Now it's come to sweet revenge  
Desperate hands  
That lose control  
Have no mercy on your soul  
On your soul  
  
Here comes revenge, just for you  
Revenge, you can't undo  
Revenge, is killing me  
Revenge, set me free  
Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth  
A life for a life, it's my burden of proof  
Revenge, just for you  
Revenge  
You ask forgiveness, I give you sweet revenge  
  
Here comes revenge, just for you  
Revenge, you can't undo  
Revenge, is killing me  
Revenge, set me free  
Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth  
A life for a life, it's my burden of proof  
Revenge, just for you  
Revenge  
You ask forgiveness, I give you sweet revenge  
  
Sweet revenge

No life till leather  
We are gonna kick some ass tonight  
We got the metal madness  
When our fans start screaming  
It's right well alright  
When we start to rock  
We never want to stop again

No more!  
The craps rolls out your mouth again  
Haven't changed, your brain is still gelatin  
Little whispers circle around your head  
Why don't you worry about yourself instead  
Who are you? where ya been? where ya from?  
Gossip is burning on the tip of your tongue  
You lie so much you believe yourself  
Judge not lest ye be judged yourself  
  
Holier than thou  
You are  
Holier than thou  
You are  
You know not  
Before you judge me take a look at you  
Can't you find something better to do  
Point the finger, slow to understand  
Arrogance and ignorance go hand in hand  
It's not who you are it's who you know  
Others lives are the basis of your own  
Burn your bridges build them back with wealth  
Judge not lest ye be judged yourself  
  
Holier than thou  
You are  
Holier than thou  
You are  
You know not

Open doors so I walk inside  
Close my eyes find my place to hide  
And I shake as I take it in  
Let the show begin  
Open my eyes  
Just to have them close again  
Well on my way  
On my way to where I graze  
It swallows me  
As it takes me in his home  
I twist away  
As I kill this world  
Open doors so I walk inside  
Close my eyes find my place to hide  
And I shake as I take it in  
Let the show begin  
Open my eyes  
Just to have them close once again  
Don't want control  
As It takes me down and down again  
Is that the moon  
Or just a light that lights this dead end street?  
Is that you there  
Or just another demon that I meet?  
The higher you are  
The farther you fall  
The longer the walk  
The farther you crawl  
My body my temple  
This temple it tells  
"Step into the house that Jack built"  
The higher you walk  
The farther you fall  
The longer the walk  
The farther you crawl  
My body my temple  
This temple it tells  
"Yes this is the house that Jack built"  
Open doors as I walk inside  
Swallow me so the pain subsides  
And I shake as I take this in  
Let the show begin  
The higher you are  
The farther you fall  
The longer the walk  
The farther you crawl  
My body my temple  
This temple it tells  
"Yes this is the house that Jack built"  
The higher you walk  
The farther you fall  
The longer the walk  
The farther you crawl  
My body my temple  
This temple it tells  
"Yes I am I am I am"  
Open my eyes  
It swallows me  
Is that you there  
I twist away  
Away  
Away  
Away

You can't put a butterfly in a jar  
If the effort's too high no matter who you are  
You can't catch the moon, or the sun or the stars  
It doesn't matter who you are  
Iced honey, iced honey  
  
Now me I've tried a million tricks  
To make life cold and make it stick  
Not running heat that flames then out  
But the proud piece of ice that always floats  
Iced honey, iced honey  
  
If I can't trap a butterfly or a bee  
If I can't keep my heart where I want it to be  
If no matter how much soul and heart  
I put to the wood  
If a flaming heart is not that good  
Iced honey, iced honey  
  
If you can't put a butterfly in a jar  
If violence mars your final hour  
If you make others feel like jam  
Poured on a piece of charbroiled lamb  
  
If it's all mixed up and you cannot shout  
And your oxygen starts to run out  
If your final gasp has the recipe wrong  
And instead of hello you say so long  
If your energy starts to leak out  
And people wonder what you're all about  
A heartbreaker with an unattached heart  
The story of love gives them all a start  
  
And me, I've always been this way  
Not by choice, just this way  
I can't put my honey pot in a jar  
Or a heart or a fist of some young boy  
  
If you can't put a butterfly in a jar  
No wonder no need to wonder where you are  
It might seem like hell, the River Styx  
Your affection never sticks  
  
No matter what you say, no matter what you do  
A butterfly heart flies right past you  
There's nothing to say, nothing to do  
See if the ice will melt for you  
See if the ice will melt for you  
See if the ice will melt for you  
See if the ice will melt for you  
See if the ice will melt for you  
Iced honey, ah ah ah iced honey  
Iced honey, iced honey  
See if the ice will melt for you  
See if the ice will melt for you  
See if the ice will melt for you  
See if the ice will melt for you  
Iced honey, iced honey  
Oh iced honey  
See if the  
See if the ice will melt for you  
Iced honey  
Iced honey

Invisible kid  
Never see what he did  
Got stuck where he hid  
Fallen through the grid  
  
Invisible kid  
Got a place of his own  
Where he'll never be known  
Inward he's grown  
  
Invisible kid  
Locked away in his brain  
From the shame and the pain  
World down the drain  
  
Invisible kid  
Suspicious of your touch  
Don't want no crutch  
But it's all too much  
  
I hide inside  
I hurt inside  
I hide inside  
But I'll show you...  
  
I'm ok, just go away  
Into distance let me fade  
I'm ok, just go away  
I'm ok, but please don't stray too far  
  
Open your heart  
I'm beating right here  
Open your mind

Out of the way and you're kept to yourself  
Oooh, can't you see that he's not here?  
He doesn't want the attention you give

Invisible kid, floats alone in his room  
Oooh, what a quiet boy you are  
He looks so calm floating 'round and around in himself

Killing and hatred, it's a terrible sight  
Reports come in of the heavy attack  
Message is seen, we're moving back  
  
Preparations are made for the journey back  
It's a survival, supplies are packed  
No more nights in this eternal hell  
Destination is simple, we move out  
  
Killing time - you left from the line  
Killing time - your turn to kill  
Killing time - what do you say?  
Killing time - aha, killing time  
  
And he knew what he needed to keep us alive  
No time for cowardice, kill and survive  
Like a killer kid with a switchblade knife  
Nasty word, he'll take your life  
  
The silence is over, they attack again  
Killing and hatred drive me insane

And it feels right this time  
On this crash course we're in the big time  
Pay no mind to the distant thunder  
Beauty fills his head with wonder, boy  
Says it feels right this time  
Turn around, found new high lights  
  
Good day to be alive sir  
Good day to be alive, he said

(take that with you)

The cerebrum has suffered massive and reparable damage  
You never know what has happened to him  
If I have not been sure of this, I would not have permitted him to live  
Where am I? Father, what happened? I need help  
  
What is democracy? What is democracy?  
It got something to do with young men killing each other, Arthur  
What if its my turn, will you want me to go?  
For democracy, any man would give his only begotten son  
  
It is impossible for any severed individual to experience pain  
Pleasure, memory, dream or thought of any kind  
This young man will be as unfeeling as unthinking as the dead  
Until the day joins them  
  
I don't know weather I'm alive or dreaming or dead or remembering  
How can you tell what's a dream and what's real  
When you can't even tell when your awake and when your asleep  
Where am I?  
  
I can't remember anything  
Can't tell if this is true or dream  
Deep down inside I feel to scream  
This terrible silence stops with me  
  
Now that the war is through with me  
I'm waking up, I cannot see  
That there's not much left of me  
Nothing is real but pain now  
  
Hold my breath as I wish for death  
Oh, please God, wake me  
  
They kept my head and chopped off everything  
Oh, God, please make them hear me  
They won't listen, they wont hear me  
They got to wake me up Ill be like this for years, hear me  
  
Back in the womb it's much too real  
In pumps life that I must feel  
But can't look forward to reveal  
Look to the time when I'll live  
  
Fed through the tube that sticks in me  
Just like a wartime novelty  
Tied to machines that make me be  
Cut this life off from me  
  
Hold my breath as I wish for death  
Oh, please God, wake me  
It's like a piece of me

Finished with my woman 'cause she couldn't help me with my mind  
People think I'm insane because I am Frowning all the time  
  
All day long I think of things but nothing seems to satisfy  
Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify  
  
Can you help me?  
Occupy my brain?  
Oh yeah  
  
I need someone to show me the things in life that I can't find  
I can't see the things that make true happiness, I must be blind  
  
Make a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh and I will cry  
Happiness I cannot feel and love to me is so unreal  
  
And so as you hear these words telling you now of my state  
I tell you to enjoy life I wish I could but it's too late

Sound is ripping through your ears  
The deafening sound of metal nears  
Your bodies waiting for his whips  
The taste of leather on your lips  
  
Hear the cry of war  
Louder than before  
With his sword in hand  
To control the land  
Crushing metal strikes  
On this frightening night  
Fall onto your knees  
For the Phantom Lord  
  
Victims falling under chains  
You hear them crying death pains  
The fists of terrors breaking through  
Now there's nothing you can do  
  
Hear the cry of war  
Louder than before  
With his sword in hand  
To control the land  
Crushing metal strikes  
On this frightening night  
Fall onto your knees  
For the Phantom Lord  
  
The leather armies have prevailed  
The Phantom Lord has never failed  
Smoke is lifting from the ground  
The rising volume metal sound  
  
Hear the cry of war  
Louder than before  
With his sword in hand  
To control the land  
Crushing metal strikes  
On this frightening night  
Fall onto your knees  
For the Phantom Lord  
  
Fall to your knees  
And bow to the Phantom Lord

Oh poor twisted me  
Oh poor twisted me  
I feast on sympathy  
I chew on suffer  
I chew on agony  
And swallow whole the pain  
Oh it's too good to be  
All this misery  
Is just for oh poor twisted me  
Poor twisted me  
Poor mistreated me  
Poor mistreated me  
I drown without a sea  
I'm filled with sorrow  
Once filled with misery  
And hated the deep dark blue  
Such a burden to bear  
Poor mistreated me  
Finally reached the shore  
Survival's gone  
Now your feeling cold ever since he was born  
Your pain is so over you  
Finally reached the shore  
Survival's gone  
Now your feeling cold ever since he was born  
Your pain is so over you  
Could ya be my friend  
Such a pain to see  
Oh poor twisted me

There's a black cloud overhead  
That's me  
And the poison ivy chokes the tree  
Again it's me  
I'm the filthy one on Bourbon Street  
You walk on by  
I'm the little boy that pushes hard  
And makes it cry  
There's a dirty needle in your child  
Haha stick me  
Empty bottles still in hand still dead  
Still me  
I'm the suit and tie that breaks the street  
And still wants more  
I'm the 45 that's in your mouth  
I'm a dirty, dirty whore  
Yeah  
Look it's me  
The one who can't be free  
Much too young to focus  
But too old to see  
Hey  
Look it's me  
When no one wants to see  
See what you brought this world  
Just what you want to see  
Hey ma  
Hey ma, look it's me  
Yeah  
He wants to become father now  
Me again, me  
The marks inside your arms still leaves me alone to me  
I'm the nothing face that plants a bomb  
And strolls away  
I'm the one who doesn't look quite right  
As children play  
Yeah  
Look it's me  
The one who can't be free  
Much too young to focus  
But too old to see  
Hey  
Look it's me  
When no one wants to see  
See what you brought this world  
Just what you want to see  
Hey ma  
Hey ma, look it's me  
It's me  
Look up to me  
What you've been and what you've feared  
Look up to me  
Look it's me, what you hear  
See right through me  
See the one who can't be free  
See right through me  
Look it's me when no one wants to see  
Hey, hey, hey  
Hm, now see the black cloud overhead  
That's me  
Hm, in this poison ivy chokes the tree  
Again it's me  
And I'm the filthy one on Bourbon Street  
You walk on by  
And I'm the little boy that pushes, pushes  
Makes it cry  
Yeah  
Look it's me  
The one who can't be free  
Much too young to focus  
But too old to see  
Hey, hey  
Look it's me

Just what you want to see

Look up to me

Pumping your blood  
Pumping blood  
Pumping your blood  
Pumping blood  
Pumping blood  
Pumping blood  
Pumping blood  
Pumping blood  
  
If I pump out blood in the sunshine  
Oil on the wheel  
That is blasted and busted away  
A nail or a little piece of glass  
A little piece of glass  
A little piece of glass  
Swarming like bees over the air  
Off the pump off the thing  
The blood that I'm pumping away  
  
Off the pump  
Off the thing  
The blood that I'm pumping away  
Off the pump  
Off the thing  
The blood that I'm pumping away  
If I pump blood in the sunshine  
And you wear a leather box with azaleas  
And I pump more blood  
And it seeps through my skin  
Will you adore the river  
The stream, the trickle  
The tributary of my heart  
As I pump more blood  
And it seeps through my skin  
Will you adore the river  
The stream, the trickle  
The tributary of my heart  
  
If I'm pumping blood  
Like a common state worker  
If I waggle my ass like a dark prostitute  
Would you think less of me  
And my coagulating heart  
Waggle my ass like a dark prostitute  
Coagulating heart  
Pumping blood  
Come on James!  
  
Would you top me off  
Would you top me off as I deepen a curtsy  
While you yell out, "mercy"  
We grow apart  
Would you rip and cut me  
Use a knife on me  
  
Be shocked at the boldness  
The coldness of this little heart  
Tied up in leather  
Would you take the measure  
Of the blood that I pump  
In the manic confusion of love  
  
Supreme violation  
Supreme violation  
"Oh, ah, ah, ah Jack I beseech you"  
"Oh Jack I beseech you"  
Supreme violation  
Blood in the foyer  
The bathroom  
The tea room  
The kitchen, with her knives splayed  
I will swallow your sharpest cutter  
Like a colored man's dick  
Blood spurting from me  
"Oh Jack, Jack I beseech"  
"Jack, I beseech you, I beseech"  
In the end it was an ordinary heart  
"Oh Jack I beseech you"  
As I scream out my pain  
In the end it was an ordinary heart  
In the end, in the end, in the end  
It was an ordinary heart  
"Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack I beseech you"  
Supreme violation oh  
"Jack, Jack, Jack I beseech you"  
I call out your name  
  
Blood in the foyer, the bathroom,  
The tea room, the kitchen  
And knives splayed  
I swallow your sharpest cutter  
Like a colored man's dick  
Blood spurting from me  
Blood spurting from me  
"Oh Jack"  
"Oh Jack, I beseech ya"  
In the end it was an ordinary heart  
In the end it was an ordinary heart  
Pumping blood

Unchain the colours before my eyes,  
Yesterday's sorrows, tomorrow's white lies.  
Scan the horizon, the clouds take me higher,  
I shall return from out of fire.  
Tears for remembrance, and tears for joy,  
Tears for somebody and this lonely boy.  
Out in the madness, the all seeing eye,  
Flickers above us, to light up the sky.  
Unchain the colours before my eyes,  
Yesterday's sorrows, tomorrow's white lies.  
Scan the horizon, the clouds take me higher,  
I shall return from out of fire  

Guilty as charged  
But dammit, it ain't right  
Someone else controlling me  
  
Death in the air  
Strapped in the electric chair  
This can't be happening to me  
  
Who made you God to say  
"I'll take your life from you!"  
  
Flash before my eyes  
Now it's time to die  
Burning in my brain  
I can feel the pain  
  
Wait for the sign  
To flick the switch of death  
It's the beginning of the end  
  
Sweat, chilling cold  
As I watch death unfold  
Consciousness my only friend  
  
My fingers grip with fear  
What I am doing here?  
  
Flash before my eyes  
Now it's time to die  
Burning in my brain  
I can feel the pain  
  
Someone help me  
Oh please God help me  
They're trying to take it all away  
I don't want to die  
  
Time moving slow  
The minutes seem like hours  
The final curtain call I see  
  
How true is this?  
Just get it over with  
If this is true, just let it be  
  
Wakened by horrid screams  
Freed from this frightening dream  
  
Flash before my eyes  
Now it's time to die  
Burning in my brain  
I can feel the pain

Stories taught  
Quiet town  
Small time for big time crowd  
Never talks  
Never plays  
Different path  
Lost his way  
The streets are red  
Red I'm afraid  
There's no confetti  
No parade  
Nothing happens in this boring place  
But oh my god how it all did change  
And they all pray  
Blood stain wash away  
He said  
"Lost my way  
This bloody day  
Lost my way"  
I heard it  
He said  
"Lost my way  
This bloody day  
Lost my way"  
Oh please wash away  
But blood stains the sun red today  
I always said  
Something wrong  
Little strange  
All day long  
Never laugh  
Never smile  
Talked alone for miles and miles and miles  
Yellow comes  
Sun I say  
Keep your smile and laugh all day  
He falls again in this foreign place  
For little boys how they do chase  
And they all pray  
Blood stain wash away  
He said  
"Lost my way  
This bloody day  
Lost my way"  
I heard it  
He said  
"Lost my way  
This bloody day  
Lost my way"  
Oh please wash away  
But blood stains the sun red today  
(Spoken)  
Yeah, well all the green things died  
When Ronnie moved to this place  
He said  
"Don't you dare ask  
Why I'm cursed to wear this face"  
I know why the children called him Ronnie frown  
When he pulled that gun from his pocket  
They all fall down down down  
He said  
"Lost my way  
This bloody day  
Lost my way"  
I heard it  
He screamed  
"Lost my way  
This bloody day  
Lost my way"  
Oh please wash away  
But blood stains the sun red today  
All things wash away  
They all fall down  
But blood stains the sun today  
All things wash away  
They all fall down  
But blood stains the sun today

(Originally recorded by Deep Purple)  
We all came out to Montreux  
On the Lake Geneva shoreline  
To make records with a mobile  
We didn't have much time  
Frank Zappa and the Mothers  
Were at the best place around  
But some stupid with a flare gun  
Burned the place to the ground  
Smoke on the water, a fire in the sky, smoke on the water  
They burned down the gamblin' house,  
It died with an awful sound  
A funky Claude was running in and out  
Pulling kids out the ground  
When it all was over  
We had to find another place  
But Swiss time was running out  
It seemed that we would lose the race  
Smoke on the water, a fire in the sky, smoke on the water  
We ended up at the Grand Hotel  
It was empty cold and bare  
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside  
Making our music there  
With a few red lights and a few old beds  
We make a place to sweat  
No matter what we get out of this  
I know, I know we'll never forget  
Smoke on the water, a fire in the sky, smoke on the water

These are the eyes that can't see me  
These are the hands that drop your trust  
These are the boots that kick you around  
This is the tongue that speaks on the inside  
These are the ears that ring with hate  
This is the face that'll never change  
This is the fist that grinds you down  
This is the voice of silence no more  
  
These are the legs in circles run  
This is the beating you'll never know  
These are the lips that taste no freedom  
This is the feel that's not so safe  
This is the face you'll never change  
This is the God that ain't so pure  
This is the God that is not pure  
This is the voice of silence no more  
  
We the people  
Are we the people? (x2)  
  
Some kind of monster...  
Some kind of monster...  
Some kind of monster...  
This monster lives  
  
This is the face that stones you cold  
This is the moment that needs to breathe  
These are the claws that scratch these wounds  
This is the pain that never leaves  
This is the tongue that whips you down  
This is the burden of every man  
These are the screams that pierce your skin  
This is the voice of silence no more  
  
This is the test of flesh and soul  
This is the trap that smells so good  
This is the flood that drains these eyes  
These are the looks that chill to the bone  
These are the fears that swing over head  
These are the weights that hold you down  
This is the end that will never end  
This is the voice of silence no more  
  
We the people  
Are we the people? (x2)  
  
Some kind of monster...  
Some kind of monster...  
Some kind of monster...  
This monster lives  
  
This is the cloud that swallows trust  
This is the black that uncolors us  
This is the face that you hide from  
This is the mask that comes undone  
  
Ominous  
I'm in us (x4)  
  
This is the cloud that swallows trust  
This is the black that uncolors us  
This is the face that you hide from  
This is the mask that comes undone  
  
Ominous  
I'm in us (x4)  
  
Are we the people?  
  
Some kind of monster...  
Some kind of monster...  
Some kind of monster ..  
The monster lives

And didn't you see me in the glass  
And didn't you hear me you never listen past  
And didn't I see you gone to seed  
And the only reason is that you're too young greed  
  
You're out there on your own  
Your face turned to stone  
Whatever happened to your life  
Stone dead forever  
  
You're in perhaps you'll listen a judge like you  
In your sweet life innocence that's nobody's fault  
You've never had it quite so good  
Because you didn't know that you even could  
  
At times it's been too old  
Your judge turned to gold  
Whatever happened to your life  
Stone dead forever  
  
And it's been a long, long time been a long, long wait  
And then you thought you'd beat us at the pearly gates  
You better leave your number, oh and we'll call you  
You must admit your problem and it's heckling you  
  
The time has come to pay  
Turns out you've been the prey  
Whatever happened to your life  
Stone dead forever

And the road becomes my bride  
I have stripped of all but pride  
So in her I do confide  
And she keeps me satisfied  
Gives me all I need  
And with dust in throat I crave  
Only knowledge will I save  
To the game you stay a slave  
  
Rover, wanderer  
Nomad, vagabond  
Call me what you will  
  
But I'll take my time anywhere  
Free to speak my mind anywhere  
And I'll redefine anywhere  
Anywhere I roam  
Where I lay my head is home  
  
And the earth becomes my throne  
I adapt to the unknown  
Under wandering stars I've grown  
By myself but not alone  
I ask no one  
  
And my ties are severed clean  
The less I have the more I gain  
Off the beaten path I reign  
Rover, wanderer  
Nomad, vagabond  
Call me what you will  
  
But I'll take my time anywhere  
I'm free to speak my mind anywhere  
And I'll never mind anywhere  
Anywhere I roam  
Where I lay my head is home  
  
But I'll take my time anywhere  
I'm free to speak my mind anywhere  
And I'll redefine anywhere  
Anywhere I roam  
Where I lay my head is home  
Carved upon my stone  
My body lie, but still I roam  
Wherever I may roam

As I was goin' over  
The Cork and Kerry Mountains  
I saw Captain Farrell  
And his money, he was countin'  
I first produced my pistol  
And then produced my rapier  
I said, "Stand and deliver or the devil he may take ya"  
  
I took all of his money  
And it was a pretty penny  
I took all of his money,  
Yeah, and I brought it home to Molly  
She swore that she loved me,  
No, never would she leave me  
But the devil take that woman,  
Yeah, for you know she tricked me easy  
  
Musha rain dum a doo, dum a da  
Whack for my daddy, oh  
Whack for my daddy, oh  
There's whiskey in the jar, oh  
  
Being drunk and weary  
I went to Molly's chamber  
Takin' Molly with me  
But I never knew the danger  
For about six or maybe seven,  
Yeah, in walked Captain Farrell  
I jumped up, fired my pistols  
And I shot him with both barrels  
  
Yeah, musha rain dum a doo, dum a da, ha, yeah  
Whack for my daddy, oh

But here I am in prison,  
Here I am with a ball and chain, yeah
