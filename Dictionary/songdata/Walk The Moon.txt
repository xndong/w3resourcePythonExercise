Until now, I knew this of myself  
That if you had thrown yourself down  
Into the lion's den  
My brother I'd follow you in  
Perhaps I lack some foresight (should have known)  
Brother you were so right  
Sure as the setting sun  
Can't trust just anyone  
  
That's what you want, but it's not what you're asking for  
I said that's what you're asking, but you're gonna get more than you bargained
for  
I said that's what you had, but you don't have it any more  
You had it coming  
  
I never imagined you dead (I never)  
But tell me, are you even aware  
That all that we did, you undo  
Iscariot, you fool  
  
That's what you want, but it's not what you're asking for  
I said that's what you're asking, but you're gonna get more than you bargained
for  
I said that's what you had, but you don't have it any more  
You had it coming  
  
Oh you know you had it coming my friend, my friend  
You know you had it coming my brother, oh my brother  
Had it coming my friend, my friend  
You know you had it coming my brother, oh my brother  
Had it coming my friend, my friend  
You know you had it coming my brother, oh my brother  
Had it coming my friend, my friend  
You had it coming.

You got curves like the ocean, gonna take it in slow motion  
Got emotions that'll make it last  
You got freckles on your shoulder, ammunition like a soldier  
And visions, ambitions to be the best  
  
Oh and Jenny why don't we, Jenny why don't we be getting together  
I said Jenny shouldn't we, Jenny shouldn't we be getting together  
  
J-J-J-Jenny's got a body just like an hourglass  
But I'm taking my time, I'm taking my time  
I wanna be the sand inside that hourglass  
Take it slow, oh, oh, gonna make it last  
  
Jenny, got your number and I've got you for the summer  
It's a bummer that things go so fast  
It's been a ride like Days of Thunder but these days have been a-running  
Like sand through the hourglass  
  
I've been dreaming that we could, dreaming that we could be sticking together  
I got evidence cause every time I turn a corner, it's up against the wall  
And as the rest of the world fades out  
As the rest of the world fades out  
  
I'm thinking Jenny's got a body just like an hourglass  
But I'm taking my time, I'm taking my time  
I wanna be the sand inside that hourglass  
Take it slow, oh, oh  
Jenny's got a body just like an hourglass  
But I'm taking my time, I'm taking my time  
I wanna be the sand inside that hourglass  
Take it slow, oh, oh  
But I'm not gonna take it from you, I'll let you give it to me  
  
I said I'm not gonna take it from you, I'll let you give it to me  
  
J-J-J-Jenny's got a body just like an hourglass  
But I'm taking my time, taking my time  
I wanna be the sand inside that hourglass  
Take it slow, oh, oh  
Jenny's got a body, yeah  
Jenny's got a body, yeah  
I wanna be the sand inside that hourglass  
Take it slow, oh, oh, gonna make it last.

My eyes are on the road  
But my mind is on your body  
My hand is on the stick shift  
And your hand is on my hand  
  
My eyes are on the road  
But my mind is on your body  
My hand is on the stick shift  
And your hand is on my hand  
  
Well push me honey to the up and right  
We've been waiting but we're next in line  
I said, the stick shift push it to the up and right  
We've been waiting but we're next in line  
  
City in the rear view  
And nothing in the distance  
We laugh at all the talk  
What do you think of getting lost?  
What do you think of you and me?  
This lion is in the garden  
Let's go way back when  
Before this ever started  
Well push me honey to the up and right  
We've been waiting but we're next in line  
I said, the stick shift push it to the up and right  
We've been waiting but we're next in line  
  
When the city shines like the sun at night  
And I feel it in my heart and my hips, I feel it  
Won't you stay shot gun until the day I die?  
Stay shotgun until the day I die  
  
I'll stay by you  
I'll stay by you oh oh  
I'll stay by you  
I'll stay by you oh oh  
  
Well push me honey to the up and right  
We've been waiting but we're next in line  
I said, the stick shift push it to the up and right  
We've been waiting but we're next in line  
  
When the city shines like the sun at night  
And I feel it in my heart and my hips I feel it  
Won't you stay shot gun until the day I die?  
Stay shotgun until the day I die  
  
Why don't you stay shotgun until the day I die?  
Why don't you stay shotgun until the day I die?  
Why don't you stay shotgun until the day I, day I,  
Why don't you stay shotgun until the day I die?

You grip your hands around my throat  
And you strip the buttons off my coat  
And I choose the methods I do best  
And the thump-thumps are thumping in you chest  
  
When you are close to me I shiver  
When you are close to me I shiver  
When you are close to me I shiver  
When you are close to me I shiver  
  
You leave these marks upon my neck  
And they're still there  
I know but I still check  
  
And the thump-thumps are thumping in my chest  
As I loose the feeling in my fingertips  
  
When you are close to me I shiver  
When you are close to me I shiver  
When you are close to me I shiver  
When you are close to me I shiver  
Now that you're dear to me  
Please check your clothing at the door  
And who you're supposed to be  
You always leave me wanting more  
Now that you're dear to me  
Shall we get intimate again?  
Now that you're dear to me  
Shall we get intimate again?  
Shall we get intimate again?  
Shall we get intimate again?  
I think so, I think so  
Shall we get intimate again?  
Now that you're dear to me, me  
  
When you are close to me I shiver  
When you are close to me I shiver  
When you are close to me I shiver  
When you are close to me I shiver  
  
When you are close to me I shiver  
When you are close to me I shiver (ooh oh, ooh oh)  
When you are close to me I shiver  
When you are close to me I shiver, shiver

Oh don't you dare look back  
Just keep your eyes on me.  
I said your holding back,  
She said shut up and dance with me!  
This woman is my destiny  
She said oh oh oh  
Shut up and dance with me  
  
We were victims of the night,  
The chemical, physical, kryptonite  
Helpless to the bass and faded light  
Oh we were born to get together,  
Born to get together.  
  
She took my arm,  
I don't know how it happened.  
We took the floor and she said  
  
Oh don't you dare look back  
Just keep your eyes on me.  
I said your holding back,  
She said shut up and dance with me!  
This woman is my destiny  
She said oh oh oh  
Shut up and dance with me  
  
A backless dress and some beat up sneaks,  
My discotheque, Juliet teenage dream.  
I felt it in my chest as she looked at me.  
I knew we were born to be together,  
Born to be together  
  
She took my arm,  
I don't know how it happened.  
We took the floor and she said  
  
Oh don't you dare look back  
Just keep your eyes on me.  
I said your holding back,  
She said shut up and dance with me!  
This woman is my destiny  
She said oh oh oh  
Shut up and dance with me  
  
Deep in her eyes,  
I think I see the future.  
I realize this is my last chance.  
  
She took my arm,  
I don't know how it happened.  
We took the floor and she said  
  
Oh don't you dare look back  
Just keep your eyes on me.  
I said your holding back,  
She said shut up and dance with me!  
This woman is my destiny  
She said oh oh oh  
Shut up and dance!  
  
Oh don't you dare look back  
Just keep your eyes on me.  
I said your holding back,  
She said shut up and dance with me!  
This woman is my destiny  
She said oh oh oh  
Shut up and dance with me  
  
Oh oh oh shut up dance with me  
Oh oh oh shut up dance with me

Easy now, with my heart  
Easy now, oh with my heart  
Walk a tightrope, walk a little tightrope  
You walk a tightrope, walk a little tightrope  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh this heart is burning up  
I said oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh this heart is burning up  
Careful now, ooo with my head  
I said careful now, what you do to my head  
Well make your mind up, make your little mind up  
To reach is oh, to reach is to oh, oh, oh,  
But oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, this heart is burning up  
I said oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, this heart is burning up  
  
In my bed, I'm rolling over  
I'm tangling up in chains on the swings on the set on the night that we met  
And now the beads of water, move up the glass  
You speak your mind, and you can not take it back  
Walk a tightrope, walk a little tightrope  
Walk a tightrope, walk a little tightrope  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh this heart is burning up  
I said oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh this heart is burning up  
I said oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh this heart is burning up  
I said oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh this heart is burning up  
It's, it's burning up  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
