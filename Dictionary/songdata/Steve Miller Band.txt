[Chorus:]  
Ain't that lovin' you, baby?  
Ain't that lovin' you, baby?  
Ain't that lovin' you, baby?  
But you don't even know my name  
  
Listen to me, baby  
What I say is true  
They could drop me in the ocean  
I'd swim to the bank  
And get back home to you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
They may kill me, darlin'  
Honey, just like they do  
Well, my body might die  
But my spirit's gonna rise  
And crawl back home to you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ain't that lovin' you, baby?  
Ain't that lovin' you, baby?  
Ain't that lovin' you, baby?  
But you don't even know my name  
Don't even know my name  
  
Ain't that lovin' you, baby?  
Ain't that lovin' you, baby?  
Ain't that lovin' you, baby?  
But you don't even know my name  
Said, you don't even know my name  
Said, you don't even know my name  
No, you don't even know my name  
No, you don't even know my name  
No, you don't even know my name

All the love pretty baby  
I have in store for you  
All the love pretty baby  
I have in store for you  
I know you love me baby  
You know I love you too  
  
All your lovin' I've been lovin'  
All your kissin' I've been kissin'  
All your lovin' I've been lovin'  
All your kissin' I've been kissin'  
Before I met you baby  
I didn't know what I'd been missin'  
  
All your lovin' I've been lovin'  
All your kissin' I've been kissin'  
All your lovin' I've been lovin'  
All your kissin' I've been kissin'  
Before I met you baby  
I didn't know what I'd been missin'  
  
All the love pretty baby

All the love pretty baby

I know you love me baby  
You know I love you too

Baby's callin' me home  
She keeps on callin' me home  
Hate to see her cryin'  
My baby knows I'm dyin'  
But she keeps on callin' me home  
  
Baby knows I've been wrong  
But she keeps on callin' me home  
Hate to see her cryin'  
My baby knows I'm dyin'  
When she keeps on callin' me home  
  
Baby's callin' me home  
She keeps on callin' me home  
Hate to see her cryin'  
My baby knows I'm dyin'  
When she keeps on callin' me home  
My baby's callin' me home  
Mm  
My baby's callin' me home

Inside her silver house, alone  
She sings a song  
Of water turned to sand  
She waits, her time is her own  
Inside her looking glass  
Black is the color she sees  
While waiting for the sun  
She lives, so patiently  
Young man travelling along  
Passes by a window  
Singing a song  
Feel the wind blow  
As my blood flows  
Through the shadows  
Of my soul, today  
See the rainbows  
As my love grows  
My heart knows  
What my mind won't say  
The living is easy  
I'm born to be free  
The living is easy  
There's no reason to explain  
Sitting in her sitting room, patiently  
She waits for a change, suddenly  
Oh, the changes come  
Hearing a song, her blood begins to flow  
She no longer is alone  
Lying in her sitting room, silently  
He touches her hand, joyfully  
And so love has begun  
With joy in her heart  
She receives his flowing soul  
And love grows  
And it grows  
And it grows  
Inside her purple house  
Oh Lord, filled by her man  
A child begins to grow  
Oh Lord, who can understand  

Big boss man  
Can't you hear me when I call  
Big boss man  
Can't you hear me when I call  
Well, you ain't so big  
You just tall that's all  
  
You got me workin' boss man  
Workin' 'round the clock  
I want a little drink of water  
But you just won't let me stop  
  
Big boss man  
Can't you hear me when I call  
Well, you ain't so big  
You just tall that's all  
  
Now I'm gonna get me a boss man  
One that's gonna treat me right  
Work hard in the day time  
Rest easy at night  
  
Big boss man  
Can't you hear me when I call  
Well, you ain't so big  
You just tall that's all  
  
Well, you ain't so big  
You just tall that's all

We came together in 1982  
Through stormy weather, we sang the blues  
You and me baby in a circle of fire  
I've had my troubles, you had yours  
We've had those feeling, but we've endured  
You and me baby in a circle of fire  
River of passion  
River of love  
You and me babe  
It's a lovers moon and the stars are out  
We're living stories that love writes about  
And I'm caught in the heat of passion's womb  
And I'm drawn in close like the tides to the moon  
It's a lovers moon and the stars are out  
We're living stories that love writes about  
And I'm caught in the heat of passion's womb  
And I'm drawn in close like the tides to the moon  
The river is wide  
The river is deep  
The river is swift  
But it's oh so sweet  
You and me baby in a circle of fire  
Just you and me baby in a circle of fire  
Just you and me baby in a circle of fire  
And I'm burnin'  
Feel me burnin' in a circle of fire  
  

I wanna talk to you  
Tell me would you like to chat  
I wanna talk to you  
And we can leave it at that  
I wanna speak to you  
Tell me what you have to say  
I wanna speak to you  
Every night and every day  
Conversation  
You can say what you like  
Conversation  
We can talk it all night  
Why don't you speak to me  
Don't you know how I feel  
Why don't you speak to me  
And tell me it's for real  
I wanna speak to you  
Of the pompitous of love  
Epismetology  
Is what I'm thinking of  
Conversation  
You can say what you like  
Conversation  
We can talk it all night  
I wanna talk to you  
Tell me would you like to chat  
I wanna talk to you  
And we can leave it at that  
I wanna speak to you  
Of the pompitous of love  
Epismetology  
Is what I'm thinking of  
Conversation  
You can say what you like  
Conversation  
We can talk it all night  

I can't imagine how to tell my story and, ah...  
Not fuss or fight, but...I really wanna talk to you  
You see, I'm not in agreement with the law this morning  
So don't be my judge and jury, do I get through to you  
But every time I try to build up my case  
You tear it down with your pretty face  
You stand your ground  
And show the lightning in your eyes  
And then I feel it  
Cool magic wins me over  
Oh, so silent, always strong and I tell ya  
Cool magic wins me over  
So, I surrender to your charm  
I'm too defensive to give up without a fight  
But you know my motions what am I gonna do  
Although it seems it's never-ending  
And I'm desperate  
To live right here  
Under your spell tonight  
And every time I try to build up my case  
You tear it down with your pretty face  
You stand your ground and  
Show the lightning in your eyes  
And then I feel it  
Cool magic wins me over  
Oh, so silent, always strong and I tell ya  
Cool magic wins me over  
So I surrender to your charm  
Just when I feel I'm 'bout to lose my mind  
Then here it comes again one more time  
I really need it  
Cool magic wins me over  
Oh, so silent, always strong and I tell ya  
Cool magic wins me over  
So I surrender to your charm  
Cool magic  
Cool magic  
Cool magic  
Cool magic  
Cool magic

Them that's got shall get  
Them that's not shall lose  
So the Bible says  
And it still is news  
  
[Chorus]  
Your mama may have  
Your papa may have  
But God bless the child  
Who's got his own  
  
The strong get more  
The weak ones fade  
Empty pockets  
Well, they don't ever make the grade  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When you've got money  
You've got lots of friends  
They're always hangin' around your door  
But when the money's all gone  
And the spending ends  
They don't come around much anymore  
  
Rich relations give  
A crust of bread and such  
You can help yourself  
But you better not take too much, no  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Them that's got shall get  
Them that's not shall lose  
So the Bible says  
And it still is news  
  
[Chorus]

Pack my bags  
Don't be too slow  
I should have quit you baby  
A long time ago  
Left you flat  
And split for Mexico  
Don't try to stop me  
Child, you're talkin' too fast  
You and your friends babe  
You are a thing in my past  
You're much too slow  
I'm goin' to Mexico  
I've got four or five hundred miles to go  
Down that southbound highway  
'53 Studebaker goin' for broke  
I'm pushin' it night and day  
I've had enough of your lies  
To last a long, long time  
You and your mother, babe  
You're like a nursery rhyme  
You're much too slow  
I'm goin' to Mexico  
Yeah, come on baby  
Yeah  
  

Gonna leave the city put my troubles behind  
People in the city goin' out of their minds  
Goin' to the country just to feel like gold  
People in the country really let themselves go  
  
Hey, ho, one thing I know  
People in the country got one thing for sure  
Hey, ho, one thing I know  
Every mother's child really lets himself go  
  
Goin' to the country and leavin' right away  
No time to talk I got to make a getaway  
Gonna leave the city it's a crime and a shame  
People in the city are goin' insane  
  
Hey, ho, one thing I know  
Every mother's child really lets himself go  
Hey, ho, one thing I know  
People in the country really let themselves go  
  
Joining hands  
Making plans  
Come on down  
Look around

When all the faces are filled with joy  
Life's a holiday  
Oh yeah  
Now I'm feelin' more and more this way  
Cause morning is the day I say oh boy  
Now the darkest night has gone to hide in shadows  
Sunbeams come beams come a dancin' in the eyes  
Here comes a majesty in rays of sunshine  
A risin' in the wind like heavens child  
  
Good morning to you  
Good morning to you  
Good morning to you  
Good morning to you  
  
Here we are in our places  
In bright shining faces  
And in our eyes is the new day  
  
Good morning  
Good, good, good, good morning  
Good, good, good, good morning  
Good, good, good, good morning  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

It's not the way that love is meant to be  
You took me by surprise but now I see  
You know this heartache-night is killing me  
(Baby bye-bye)  
Forget the past, honey  
Better try someone new (Baby don't cry)  
There's nothing left here  
For me or for you  
You know this heartache-night  
Will soon be through  
Goodbye love  
Goodbye love  
Goodbye love  
What's done is done, darling  
This much is true  
It's all over now  
Don't be blue  
You know this heartache-night  
Will soon be through  
Goodbye love  
Goodbye love  
Goodbye love  
Baby bye-bye  
Goodbye love  
Baby bye-bye  
Goodbye love  
Baby bye-bye  
Goodbye love  
Goodbye love  
Goodbye love  

I can see the harbor lights  
Looks like the fourth of July  
Maybe Christmas night  
Reflected in water  
In my cell, behind this wall  
I share my time  
With many a soul who is lost  
Why must I always be a loser  
Why can't I ever be a winner  
So as time  
Goes rolling by  
I lose my chance  
It's only one life  
If I had the wings of an angel  
O'er these prison walls I would fly  
Straight from the darkness into the light  
Why must I always be a loser  
Why can't I ever be a winner  
Spoken: My dearest darling, as I'm writing you this letter  
They're coming to take me away  
They're beginning to shave my head now, sweetheart  
But as their doing it  
I just want you to know  
That I wouldn't have it any other way  
I'm glad that I killed your mother  
She was a low-down dirty old hag  
But in the end darling  
You will get your revenge  
Because you see  
Their gonna send you my belongings  
In a plastic bag  
La, la, la  
A plastic bag  
  

I've got a heart like a wheel  
Feel like I got to roll  
Oh  
Heart like a wheel  
  
I told you so  
And I've been loving you for so long  
You are the one  
Heart so real  
  
I love you so  
Well, I can give what I take  
And you know I want to give you my love  
Babe I ain't faking  
  
You know I want to give you my love  
I've been loving you for so long  
You are the one  
Heart so real  
  
I love you so  
Come on and roll  
I've been loving you for so long  
You are the one  
  
Heart so real  
I love you so  
It takes two to make love  
It takes love to make a family real  
  
I got to know what you need  
I got to know what you really feel  
And I've been loving you for so long  
You are the one  
  
Heart so real  
I love you so  
Come on and roll  
You know it's such a pity  
  
If you're going to get the summertime blues  
Lovers everywhere are pairing off two by twos  
And I've been loving you for so long  
You are the one  
  
Heart so real  
I love you so  
I've been loving you for so long  
You are the one  
  
Heart so real  
I love you so  
I've got a heart like a wheel  
I love you so  
  
I've got a heart like a wheel  
I've got to roll

Singing a song of love  
Growing each day  
Knowing how it's been  
Living for today  
I wanted to love you, babe  
I swear I do know how  
To go back is pointless  
Understand this now  
Our time, it hasn't been too long  
It all seems to drift away  
No more the past  
It's the future  
That I'm living for today  
And if it's not getting you  
Where ever you need to go  
There's still a place in my heart  
If you did not know this is so  
In my first mind  
You are so fine  
All the good things you do  
Are in my own time  
In my second mind  
I can see you grow  
Feel you flow  
It moves my soul, yeah  

Feel like I'm livin' under some kind of hex  
Livin' in here in this industrial military complex  
Doesn't really help when I read Time magazine  
Cause they only distort the scene  
The sky is so hazy I can't even see the sun  
Livin' here is like livin' under a gun  
I really do wonder 'bout the United Nations  
Why don't they face the situations  
I'm a troubadour  
Lookin' for a dream  
I'm a troubadour  
Lookin' for some dream  
Lord, I'm so tired of payin' all of these dues  
From Sunday to Sunday all I hear is bad news  
Tired of the war and those industrial fools  
Got to make it better cause I've got nothin' to lose  
Ain't too clear to pay my income taxes  
'Specially when I know it goes to kill the masses  
Love to hear the President make it perfectly clear  
How the donkeys and the elephants are police up here  
I'm a troubadour  
Lookin for a dream  
I'm a troubadour  
Lookin for some dream  
Lord, I'm so tired of payin' all of these dues  
From Sunday to Sunday all I hear is bad news  
Tired of the war and those industrial fools  
I've got to make it better cause I've got nothin' lose  
Won't somebody help me cause I've gotten in my shoes  
Those industrial military complex blues  
  

I was down in Nashville just payin' my dues  
Headed for Ohio when I read the news  
'Bout the people demonstrating 'gainst the President's views  
Four were shot down by the National Guard troops  
Just like Uncle Sam I put on my fighting shoes  
School shot down cause there's no more to lose  
Now we're headed to D.C. two by twos  
Cause those low down, profound, killin' four blues  
Lookin' for my Congressman to make it well known  
But the politicians already won't answer his telephone  
Making in his office while they're shooting kids down at home  
Worried about the voters but he won't be worried long  
Silent majority still glued to the tube  
Say CIA ain't lookin', FBI come unglued  
Shot some more in Jackson just to show the world what they can do  
While we're marching to D.C. cause there's too much to do  
Give peace a chance  
Give peace a chance  
There's no turnin' back my friend  
There's no turnin' back  
When the President said that the tear gas is gone  
The army's pulled out leavin' blood on the ground  
The streets are empty and the crying's died down  
You can be President if no one's around  
Just like Kow Kow, you've heard it before  
Get back gangster, don't you open that door  
Space Cowboy's back to tell you the score  
Nothing any good is gonna come from a war  
Got those low down, profound, killin' four blues  
Give peace a chance  
Give peace a chance  
Give peace a chance  
  

Leavin' home, out on the road  
I've been down before  
Ridin' along in this big ol' jet plane  
I've been thinkin' about my home  
But my love light seems so far away  
And I feel like it's all been done  
Somebody's tryin' to make me stay  
You know I've got to be movin' on  
  
Oh, oh big ol' jet airliner  
Don't carry me too far away  
Oh, oh big ol' jet airliner  
Cause it's here that I've got to stay  
  
Goodbye to all my friends at home  
Goodbye to people I've trusted  
I've got to go out and make my way  
I might get rich you know I might bet busted  
But my heart keeps calling me backwards  
As I get on the 707  
Ridin' high I got tears in my eyes  
You know you got to go through hell  
Before you get to heaven  
  
Big ol' jet airliner  
Don't carry me too far away  
Oh, oh big ol' jet airliner  
Cause it's here that I've got to stay  
  
Touchin' down in New England town  
Feel the heat comin' down  
I've got to keep on keepin' on  
You know the big wheel keeps on spinnin' around  
And I'm goin' with some hesitation  
You know that I can surely see  
That I don't want to get caught up in any of that  
Funky shit goin' down in the city  
  
Big ol' jet airliner  
Don't carry me too far away  
Oh, oh big ol' jet airliner  
Cause it's here that I've got to stay  
  
Oh, oh big ol' jet airliner  
Don't carry me too far away  
Oh, oh big ol' jet airliner  
Cause it's here that I've got to stay  
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah  
  
Big ol' jet airliner  
Don't carry me too far away  
Oh, oh big ol' jet airliner  
Cause it's here that I've got to stay  
  
Oh, oh big ol' jet airliner  
Carry me to my home  
Oh, oh big ol' jet airliner  
Cause it's there that I belong

Some people call me the space cowboy yeah  
Some call me the gangster of love  
Some people call me Maurice  
Cause' I speak of the promises of love  
  
People talk about me baby  
Say I'm doin' you wrong, doin' you wrong  
But don't you worry baby don't worry  
Cause' I'm right here at home  
  
Cause' I'm a picker  
I'm a grinner  
I'm a lover  
And I'm a sinner  
Playin' my music in the sun  
I'm a joker  
I'm a smoker  
I'm a mid-night toker  
I get my lovin' on the run  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  
  
You're the cutest thing that I ever did see

Want to shake your tree  
Lovey dovey, lovey dovey, lovey dovey all the time  
Ooh wee baby, I sure show you a good time  
  
Cause' I'm a picker

And I'm a sinner  
Playin' my music in the sun  
I'm a joker

Really love your peaches want to shake your tree  
Lovey dovey, lovey dovey, lovey dovey all the time  
Come on baby now, I'll show you a good time

Listen to the blackbird sadly sing  
For you, for me  
Look at all the pointless suffering  
Humanity  
I am dreaming of a garden  
And I see the midnight flight  
Of a blackbird, through my vision  
To the light  
To the light  
She is standing in the doorway  
With the love light in her eye  
And she beckons me to journey  
Through the night  
Through the night  
Listen to the blackbird sadly sing  
For you, for me  
Look at all the pointless suffering  
Humanity  
To the people, who are naked  
As they breathe in amber haze  
Wandering endlessly narcotic  
Through the maze  
Through the maze  
To the leaders, who are timeless  
As they flaunt their warlike ways  
Flying endlessly o'er the wasteland  
Seeking praise  
Seeking praise  
Listen to the blackbird sadly sing  
For you, for me  
Look at all the pointless suffering  
Humanity  
  

I met you on somebody's island  
You thought you had known me before  
I brought you a crate of papaya  
They waited all night by your door  
You probably wouldn't remember  
I probably couldn't forget  
Jungle love in the surf in the pouring rain  
Everything's better when wet  
  
Jungle love it's drivin' me mad  
It's makin' me crazy  
Jungle love it's drivin' me mad  
It's makin' me crazy  
  
But lately you live in the jungle  
I never see you alone  
But we need some definite answers  
So I thought I would write you a poem  
The question to everyone's answer  
Is usually asked from within  
But the patterns of the rain  
And the truth they contain  
Have written my life on your skin  
  
Jungle love it's drivin' me mad  
It's makin' me crazy  
Jungle love it's drivin' me mad  
It's makin' me crazy  
  
You treat me like I was your ocean  
You swim in my blood when it's warm  
My cycles of circular motion  
Protect you and keep you from harm  
You live in a world of illusion  
Where everything's peaches and cream  
We all face a scarlet conclusion  
But we spend our time in a dream  
  
Jungle love it's drivin' me mad  
It's makin' me crazy  
Jungle love it's drivin' me mad  
It's makin' me crazy  
  
Jungle love it's drivin' me mad  
It's makin' me crazy  
Jungle love it's drivin' me mad  
It's makin' me crazy

My sweet child was seen across town  
With some stranger man  
She had a smile on her face, looked out of place  
Suitcase was in her hand  
Junior saw it happen  
Why didn't I listen to you? Hey  
Whoa, ohh, whoa  
Could've had her back  
Whoa, ohh, whoa  
Now she's down the tracks with him  
I remember on the day she left me  
That's one thing I'll never forget  
In the apartment we owned, all she left was a phone  
And a broken down TV set  
Junior saw it happen  
Why didn't I listen to you? Hey  
Whoa, ohh, whoa  
Could've had her back  
Whoa, na na na na na, whoa  
Now she's down the tracks with him  
Didn't believe it when I first got word  
But boy, I sure do now  
I couldn't face it, my mind wouldn't take it  
It didn't make sense somehow  
Because I thought you was happy with the way we lived  
And the things that we used to do  
Whoa, no no no, whoa  
Had her back  
Whoa, no no no no no no no, whoa  
Now she's down the tracks with him  

I don't want much  
I just want a little bit  
No I don't want it all  
I just want a little bit  
Just an eeny-weeny bit  
Just a teeny-weeny bit of your love  
  
Turn your lamp down low  
Now honey won't you slip me a kiss  
Turn your lamp down low  
Babe you know I can't resist  
From an eeny-weeny bit  
Just a teeny-weeny bit of your love  
  
I want you forever  
Not just for peace of mind  
Please say you'll never leave me  
Not until the end of time  
From an eeny-weeny bit  
Just a teeny-weeny bit of your love  
  
Turn your lamp down low  
Now honey won't you slip me a kiss  
Turn your lamp down low  
Babe you know I can't resist  
From an eeny-weeny bit  
Just a teeny-weeny bit of your love  
  
[Repeat: x3]  
From just a teeny-weeny bit  
Just an eeny-weeny bit of your love

Sensations drift away  
When I'm all alone  
How can you take away my feelings  
Bet our love until you lose  
Then give back what you've been stealing  
All these changes I go through  
Keeps me wondering why  
I'm still loving you  
Keeps me wondering why  
All these things that you do  
Keeps me wondering why  
Temptation rips away  
Can this girl stay true  
I just keep hanging on  
Cause I know it's hard to find the magic  
That's in every part of you  
All the boys, they got to have it  
All these changes I go through  
Keeps me wondering why  
I'm still loving you  
Keeps me wondering why  
All these things that you do  
Keeps me wondering why  
I'm still loving you  
Keeps me wondering  
Keeps me wondering  
Keeps me wondering...  
Keeps me wondering why  
I'm still loving you  
Keeps me wondering why  
All these things that you do  
Keeps me wondering why  
I'm still in love with you  
Keeps me wondering why  
All these things that you do  
Keeps me wondering why  
You know, I'm still in love with you  
Keeps me wondering why  
All these things that you do  
Keeps me wondering why  
I'm still in love with you  
  

I've got the key to the highway  
I am bound to go  
I'm gonna roam this highway  
Till my dying day  
When the moon peeks over the mountain  
Honey, I'll be on my way  
I'm gonna roam this highway  
Till my dying day  
Give me one more, one more kiss, mama  
Just before I go  
'Cause when I leave here, baby  
I won't be back, no, I won't be back anymore  
To the highway  
Oh, Lord, I'm out and bound to go  
I'm gonna leave here running  
'Cause walking's much too slow  

Kow kow calqulator  
Was a very smooth operator  
Had himself a pet alligator  
Kept it in a chrome elevator, yeah  
When the sun began to shine  
The alligator come outside  
Kow kow played the chimes  
Together they would go for a ride  
As they travelled with a heavy load  
They came across a dead horse at the side of the road  
With two generals standing at each end  
Fighting over whose fault it had been  
And all that's left was this war  
And they couldn't get things back together like they were before  
Well, listen  
Turn on your love light  
Turn it on, let it shine  
Inside your heart  
Let it shine, turn it on  
Your love light  
Turn it on  
Turn it on  
Let it shine  
Inside your mind  
So many times kow kow had heard it said before  
Oh, don't, lord, don't go near that door  
The cause of our evil you'll uncover  
Because of our misery you discover  
Well, misery seeks it's own company  
Kow kow had heard it said  
Now he sits there crying  
Oh, with his hands across his head  
Kow kow calqulator  
Oh, a very smooth operator  
Get back in your elevator  
Kow kow calqulator  
Turn on your love light  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
Let it shine  

Oh baby, don't you want a man like me  
Oh baby, don't you want a man like me  
Think about your future  
Forget about your used to be  
Just a little bit of rock  
Just a taste or two of roll  
I'll give you sweet inspiration  
Till it satisfies your soul  
Oh baby, don't you want a man like me  
Let me serve you pretty baby  
Serve you until you're free  
Let me serve you in the morning  
Let me serve you in the afternoon  
I want to love you pretty mama  
Underneath the silvery moon  
Oh baby, don't you want a man like me  
Let me serve you pretty baby  
Think about what could be  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.....  

Oh, 20th century

Working on the line just trying to make a dollar  
Along came the boss and he tapped me on the shoulder  
He said I got to make my little light shine  
If I want to keep my job, I got to work it double time  
Baby it's our destiny  
You know we're living in the 20th century  
Oh, 20th century

But I got to keep on working 'cause they can't stop the line  
Baby it's our destiny  
You know we're living in the 20th century

So you think you know just what goes on inside your head, my friend  
There is so much more than you and I can comprehend  
Things that make you laugh, things that make you cry  
Let you love when you feel like you wanna die  
  
There's no answer to the questions that we find inside, my friend  
But when we start to wonder why, we wind up further behind, my friend  
All we see has always been shown

Go on take the money and run  
Go on take the money and run  
Go on take the money and run

Baby got into her car  
Drove all the way to New York City  
Um Hummmm  
She played her guitar there  
They made her a star in New York City  
Um Hummmm  
She went to Paris, France  
That's where she got the chance  
To be a movie star  
I got a post card from Rome  
Then she was headin' home  
To America  
A superstar  
She'd come so far  
Dit dit die o  
Dit dit die o  
Dit dit die o  
Dit dit die o  
Well, it wasn't very long  
Till she was back out on  
That old freeway  
Um Hummmm  
She drove across the mountains  
The prairies, the deserts  
Of the U.S.A.  
Um Hummmm  
Hollywood gave her a call  
She went and lived it all  
On the silver screen  
Sometimes she laughed and she cried  
She kept it all inside  
For the magazines  
The silver screen  
The Hollywood dream  
Dit dit die o  
Dit dit die o  
Dit dit die o  
Dit dit die o  
She lives in an ivory tower  
A tower built by fame  
Um Hummmm  
She's got the wealth and power  
But she hasn't got a man  
Um Hummmm  
No matter how hard she tried  
She was so empty inside  
So lonely  
She hung her head and she cried  
Was it the love she denied  
Never satisfied  
Deep inside  
She said goodbye  
She paid the price for her fame  
Everyone knows her name  
America  
A superstar  
She'd come so far  
Dit dit die o  
Dit dit die o  
Dit dit die o  
Dit dit die o  
Dit dit die o  
Dit dit die o  
  

Do doot do do dooo  
Do doot doot do do  
Do doot do do dooo  
Do doot doot do do  
Sittin' in a bar in San Francisco  
Got no place to go  
Sun is going down, man  
Sun is going down  
Sittin' in the bar out at the airport  
Tryin' to flag a plane  
Plane she won't fly  
Plane she won't fly  
I've been travellin' such a long, long time  
Out here on this road  
I've been livin' such a lonely life  
Tryin' to get back home  
Livin' a lonely life, tryin' to get back home  
Do doot do do dooo  
Do doot doot do do  
I've been livin' such a lonely life  
Out here on this road  
I've been livin' such a lonely life  
Tryin' to find a home

Ask my baby what she wants to be  
She'll say a monkey swingin' in a tree  
Ask my baby what she's thinkin' of  
She'll say there's nothing greater than love  
  
Well, look through the window  
Tell me what do you see  
A beautiful planet  
Peace and harmony  
  
Think love you're surrounded  
We are one you and I  
Gather your leaves together  
There's only love until we die  
Until we die  
  
Ask my baby what she's goin' through  
She'll say the same thing, the same thing as you  
Ask my baby what she's thinkin' of  
She'll say there's nothing greater than love  
  
Look through the window  
Tell me what do you see  
A beautiful planet  
Peace and harmony  
  
Think love you're surrounded  
We are one you and I  
Gather your leaves together  
There's only love until we die  
Until we die

Sittin' gettin' higher in the back of a limousine  
While people all around me  
They are finding it harder to dream  
Impossible people seen only in nightmares  
Are beginning to make it real  
And disorder keeps fadin'  
The times they are changin'  
Well, I wish I was behind the wheel  
So I could live it just a little bit longer  
Do my best to make our love stronger  
In a while I know it's gonna change  
We've got to live it just a little bit longer  
Do our best to make our love stronger  
In a while I know it's gonna change  
Well, time and time and time again  
I've been stuck out in the rain  
But life has been so doggone sweet  
There's no reason to complain  
But the time has come for all to be one  
Yes, we can talk about it now  
And from the middle of the mess  
Here comes one more guess  
And I know it's gonna work somehow  
If we can live it just a little bit longer  
Do our best to make our love stronger  
In a while I know it's gonna change  
We've got to live it just a little bit longer  
Do our best to make our love stronger  
In a while I know it's gonna change  
Cause we've gotta live it just a little bit longer  
Do our best to make our love stronger  
In a while I know it's gonna change  
We've got to live it just a little bit longer  
Do our best to make our love stronger  
In a while I know it's gonna change  
Now who would ever believe it could happen  
Right here in my hometown  
Especially when it's so far north  
Of the Mason-Dixon line  
But some of the people they just won't forget  
While others slip into regret  
And if things keep goin' the way they're goin'  
I just might get killed yet  
But I wanna live it just a little bit longer  
Do my best to make our love stronger  
In a while I know it's gonna change  
We've got to live it just a little bit longer  
Do our best to make our love stronger  
In a while I know it's gonna change  
And in a while I know it's gonna change  
And in a while I know it's gonna change  

I ain't complainin'  
But I'd sure like to find me  
A true, fine love  
Someone another  
That's as sweet as your mother  
A true, fine love  
  
Cause the time is right  
For walking in the moonlight  
I have suddenly found I'm ready to settle down  
So come on get your rocks off  
I'm gonna knock your socks off  
  
You'll see, oh yeah  
So come on pretty baby  
We're going to raise a family  
  
There'll be no hesitatin'  
Cause I'm so tired of waitin'  
For a true, fine love  
Someone another  
Like a sister or brother  
A true, fine love  
  
Cause the time is right  
For walking in the moonlight  
I have suddenly found I'm ready to settle down  
So come on get your rocks off  
I'm gonna knock your socks off  
  
You'll see, oh yeah  
So come on pretty baby

Come on baby raise a family

You see  
Ooh yea

Everybody wants to be her man  
Everybody knows her name  
And every single time that she walks by  
Everybody just falls back lame  
Everybody wants to see her  
Ain't nobody wants to talk  
They're afraid that they might say too much  
Afraid that she might walk  
You know she walks like a lady  
But she acts like a child  
She can drive you crazy  
Yeah, she can drive you wild  
Talks like a baby  
But she looks like a lady to me  
Why do they blame her  
Why do they call her name that way  
All they want to do is  
Try to shame her  
Try to make her play their game that way  
They'll never chain her down  
They'll never make her stay that way  
She's not that way  
You can't explain her cause all she wants to do is  
Walk like a lady  
But she acts like a child  
She can drive you crazy  
Yeah, she can drive you wild  
Talks like a baby, but she looks like a lady to me  
Time just keeps on passin'  
Till I finally asked her out  
She said pick me up at eight  
And don't be late  
And we'll see what you're about  
Up to the drive just ready to roll  
The girl was no where to be seen  
She stood me up, she knocked me down  
Boy, that girl is mean  
You know she walks like a lady  
But she acts like a child  
She can drive you crazy  
Yeah, she can drive you wild  
Talks like a baby, but she looks like a lady to me  
Why do they blame her  
Why do they call her name that way  
All they want to do is  
Try to shame her  
Try to make her play their game that way  
They'll never chain her down  
They'll never make her stay that way  
She's not that way  
You can't explain her cause all she wants to do is  
Walk like a lady  
Talk like a lady  
You know she walks like a lady  
You know she talks like a baby  
Walk like a lady  
Talk like a lady  
You know she walks like a lady  
You know she talks like a baby  
Looks like a lady to me  
Looks like a lady to me  
Looks like a lady to me  
  

When sunny gets blue  
Her eyes get gray and cloudy  
Then the rain begins to fall  
Pitter, patter, pitter, patter  
Love has gone so what can matter  
No lover man comes to call  
  
When sunny gets blue  
She breathes a sigh of sadness  
Like the wind that stirs the tree  
Wind that sets the leaves to swayin'  
Like some violins are playin'  
Weird and haunting melody  
  
People used to love to hear her laugh, to see her smile  
That's how she got her name  
Since that sad affair  
She's lost her smile, she's changed her style  
Somehow she's not the same  
But memories will fade and pretty dreams will rise up  
Where her other dreams fell through  
Hurry new love, hurry here  
And brush away each falling tear and hold her near  
When sunny gets blue

I left my message on your number  
In hopes that you might call  
Riding high on good intentions  
Still hanging on the wall  
Although my words were never all too  
Clear it's understood  
It's never too late to say in other ways  
Something in our lives we'll rearrange  
More than just your call on holiday  
Ring me up, don't bring me down  
Don't let me hear you won't  
Come through tonight  
Ring me up, don't bring me down  
You know this lonely heart stands by me  
While I'm waiting  
Remembering how it came together  
The meaning in your eyes  
Now words fall out like perfect strangers  
We both apologize  
In all this time I thought I knew you  
And over looked somehow the reasons why  
You kept inside  
Ring me up, don't bring me down  
Don't let me hear you won't  
Come through tonight  
This lonely heart stands by me  
While I'm waiting  
Ring me up, don't bring me down  
Don't let me hear you won't  
Come through tonight  
Ring me up, don't bring me down  
Here's hoping the days gone by we'll see again  
This lonely heart stands by and I'm still waiting  
Ooh still waiting  
Ooh still waiting  
  

In the winter time  
When all the leaves are brown  
And the wind blows so chill  
And the birds have all flown for the summer  
I'm callin', hear me callin', hear me callin'  
  
In the winter time  
When all the leaves are brown  
And the wind blows so chill  
And the birds have all flown for the summer  
I'm callin', hear me callin', hear me callin'  
I'm callin', hear me callin', hear me callin'  
In the winter time  
  
In the winter time  
When all the leaves are brown  
And the wind blows so chill  
And the birds have all flown for the summer  
I'm callin', hear me callin, hear me callin'

Darling you send me  
Darling you send me, yeah  
Darling you send me (come on baby, come on)  
Honest you do (you know it)  
Honest you do (come on, don't be nervous)  
Honest you do  
  
Darling you move me  
Darling you move me, yeah  
Darling you move me  
Honest you do, honest you do  
  
Oh, and at first I thought it was infatuation  
But, oh, it's lasted so long  
That now I find myself wanting to marry you  
And take you home  
  
Oh, you send me  
Darling you send me  
Darling you, you, you send me  
Honest you do, honest you do  
  
Oh, and at first I thought it was infatuation  
But, oh, it's lasted so long  
That now I find myself wanting to marry you  
And take you home  
  
Oh, you move me, yeah  
Darling you move me  
Darling you move me  
Honest you do, honest you do

I see you jaded like a debutante  
Things your image never shows  
There's something hiding deep inside of you  
Something that I'll never know  
Then I saw you on the streets alone  
Had you paged on the corner phone  
The words just kept me straining to express  
You're hard to break and you still ache  
Like a young girl, like a young girl's heart  
Like a young girl, just like a young girl's heart  
I stand here waiting in my lily white  
Scan the lines you'll be famous for  
Then we'll talk about what's good and what's bad  
Romantic moves we won't have to score  
Like you were saying what you really want  
Ah, it's funny you should ask me now  
It was all right there in the story I just read  
I'm hard to break and you still ache  
Like a young girl, like a young girl's heart  
Like a young girl, just like a young girl's heart  
Like a young girl, just like a young girl's heart  
Like a young girl, like a young girl's heart  
Just like a young girl, like a young girl's heart  
Like a young girl, just like a young girl's heart  
Like a young girl, like a young girl's heart  
Like a young girl, just like a young girl's heart  
Like a young girl, like a young girl's heart  
Just like a young girl's heart  

Winter's people watching  
As I sail from season's four  
To join some crazy ladies  
In a game upon the shore  
None of them with broken wings  
But still refuse to fly  
So with sweetness on my lips  
I smile a last goodbye  
And now I spend my life  
On the velvet side of hell  
Aimlessly here searching  
For what I cannot tell  
The quietness is terrible  
It's more than I can stand  
But thousands now stand cheering  
As my blood flows in the sand  
Spoken: You're not the child  
You thought you were  
You wake up in the night  
And know you're blind  
And yet they keep on pushing  
Trying the insides of your mind  
Forever, forever arresting to control  
Until the emptiness of heaven welcomes your weary soul  
Rise up with the new dawn's early morning  
Feel the sunshine warm upon your face  
Tomorrow's come a long, long way to help you  
Yes, it's your saving grace  
Every day, every way  
Tomorrow, it's your saving grace  
Well, now got no time to worry  
Cause I've got no time to hurry  
Baby, it's your saving grace  
Now don't you lay those blames on me  
Don't you play those games on me  
Cause baby it's your saving grace  
You got to need a little lovin'  
Now baby it's your saving grace  
Hey, I feel alright  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Your saving grace  
Ah, hey, hey, hey  
Your saving grace  
La la la la la la la la....  
Oh baby, it's your saving grace  
  

Saw a girl walkin' down the street  
Upsettin' everybody she meet  
Well, she walks up to the corner  
She stops, everybody they want her  
  
She's fine  
Yes, yes, yes, she's fine  
She's a fine, pretty thing  
I wanna love her all the time  
  
Well, I said tell me baby  
Honey, where you goin'  
She said darlin'  
Well, I wouldn't be knowin'  
She had on a long evening frock  
She stopped in the street and did the ? rock  
  
She's fine  
Yeah, she's fine  
She's a fine, pretty thing  
I wanna love that woman all the time  
  
Well, I said tell me baby  
What you thinkin' of  
She said there isn't anything greater than love  
She looked at me  
And she gave me a smile  
Shook her head and winked her eye  
  
But she's fine  
Yes, yes, she's fine  
She's a fine, pretty thing  
I need to love that woman all the time
