[Z-Ro]  
It's like tears doesn't matter to you, it's like you laughed at my pain  
Put me in a position to pick up a pistol, and I'll blast in the game  
I'm going crazy, being murdered by the hands of cancer  
Auntie asked if I wanted to die, but couldn't understand my answer  
See it's fucked up when you loving, they don't love you in return  
Fuck around and wait till you get on your feet, and slug you till it burn  
Niggas is flies yeah they over rise, but I hide in the dark  
Cause where the fuck was these niggas at, when I resided in parks  
Bitch I slept on the bench, ten feet away from the bullet proof fence  
But at least, I ain't have to pay no rent  
I'm thinking of espree, damn near positive that you regret me  
But I pray to God, you'll never forget me, remember me  
I represented for the both of us, how could you love me  
And not trust me, somewhere hated now there's no more us plus  
Sammy Lee it was a tragedy, your boo was found dead  
Here's my shoulder for you my nigga, rest your head  
  
[Chorus - 2x]  
This is where they all fall down  
Putting burners to they brain, till it bang  
There's no way for the real, to maintain  
This is where they all fall down  
Pay your dues, cause you owe  
When it's your time, God'll give you the go  
  
[Den Den]  
I sit back and put my thoughts, on paper and rhymes  
Tripping on the situations, that I'm facing in life  
All this shifeness around me, but I still prevail  
Get caught some shit we done together, and I'm making your bail  
Cut your tail, while you fall down homie  
Plus I'm in the kitchen cooking, so your family won't come hold me  
Fuck that phony shit, that these fake niggas on  
I get that pony bitch, then I get that hustle on  
Staying strong like ammonia, as I bleed the block  
Leaving that bitch swollen up, like I beat the cops  
Going rock for rock, breaking down every zone  
95 hundred woofing, where these niggas be strong  
Staying alone to my own, with my baby and wife  
Plus I'm keeping the bread a nine, cause I'm guarding my life  
Ain't no slipping in my game, doing a dance to make it rain  
Put a pistol to your head, and ease your pain  
  
[Chorus - 2x]  
  
[Z-Ro]  
I feel like I invented pain, might go any minute mayn, starting a bit of  
robbery  
Homicide and lean on they destiny, in an attempt to get the pain  
Constant strain, here we go again another day in the life  
If I'm blessed, can I just get one successful day in my life  
My life is the prime example, of a good nigga gon wrong  
And I trust no one plus I'm not friendly, so leave me alone  
See I don't need a click of yes men, when I walk the block  
My retaliation is only, when I chalk the block  
I stay in a sweet leaf, each time I meditate on how to live  
Nothing but negative everywhere I turn, ain't no more positive  
Nothing but drama, cause drama makes the world go round  
But pretty soon, it'll make the world go down  
Just get a weapon of situation, if you starving then you hungry right now  
I can't wait a whole pay period, I need money right now  
So when I bleed the block I'm not gon bleed a lot, just enough to keep  
The bills paid, and enough to keep some fiddles in a pot  
  
[Chorus - 2x]  

[Z-Ro]  
One of my partnas have been shot  
And all that's going through my mind  
Is he dead or alive, when I'm pacing the flo'  
And looking around 4-5  
Thinking of the worst, but nobody would tell me the drama  
But the silence is killing me, checking on his family  
Saying a prayer for him and his mama  
Come through sit at his bedside, and ease his pain  
Relieve my tension, I'm flinching when they mention name  
Big D, come G, I don't want you to die  
Remember when we use to dip  
In your day-day Coupe and get high  
Remember, when you use to think I was crazy and wouldn't chill with me  
You come to get me up the flip, and smoke some kill with me  
I really appreciate the love that was shown  
I'ma keep the faith and never leave you alone  
You can depend on me, got down on my knees  
And I prayed, until you recovered  
Then jumped your big ass, right back off in the game  
Because there's money to be made, and I won't knock you  
Just watch yourself when you in them streets  
And keep your heater, under your seat when you creep  
[Hook - 4x]  
And to my G's  
Don't worry bout a damn thang  
[Z-Ro]  
You use to call me G.I., but to me you was s soldier indeed  
Even though you dodged the cops daily, you would hit my crib up with weed  
Freestyling to beats, and smoking on fire sweet and parlay  
You should of got a purple heart, for living in a war everyday  
If he's really a friend, you would turn him in  
That's what the laws would tell us  
And fellas would talk about turning you in  
How could your hood be so jealous  
And ready to give out the location, of a G on the move  
Somebody tell me, is your partna's freedom worth some money to you  
But I know he's in the county jail stressed, fuck stabbing you in your back  
Cause they smile up in your face, and stab you in your chest  
And its kinda hard, to receive the swishas they pass me  
When I feel I got to watch the people, they call his still family  
Must a song be coming, cause it happened the way you said it would unfold  
My name is Grady, and they watch me like the Super Bowl  
Now that your not around, I'ma still put it down the way you told me to do  
And when I go gold its dedicated to you, and to my G's  
[Hook - 4x]  
[Verse 3]  
I'm still trying to figure out what happened  
One minute you here, then the next you was gone  
Just think quick, I lost my nigga  
Victimized to the game, and we still mourn  
But nigga hold on, cause I know its living life  
Trapped in this cell, trying to ease the pain  
But it still remains, every time I put you in jail  
And its hard to accept the fact, that you a cellmate my nigga  
Po' out some liquor, and sho' wish was here to light, up this swisha  
And I'll never forget the advice you gave me bout life, cause you were right  
Don't shake them dikes, cause the rules apply, ain't always precise  
I'm paying a price, my freedom been taken away  
And they threw away the key, trapped in misery  
Cause suffering forced me to run these streets so desperately  
And to my G's watch your back, cause it ain't no love in these streets  
It seems like each day, there's a different way, to fall victim to defeat  
Cause if you real with your boy, it don't hurt to see him fall off  
When a forty get low point to the curb, just letting you know you thought of  
No matter what when you get out, thangs'll still be the same  
But until then hold on nigga, and don't worry bout a damn thang  
[Hook - 4x]  
[Z-Ro]  
This world is not my home, I'm just a passing through  
My treasures are laid out, somewhere beyond the blue  
The angels beckon me, from Heaven's open doors  
And a nigga can't feel at home in the this world no mo'  
Feel at home in this world no mo'

I can't leave drank alone it got me feeling  
(Feeling feeling good feeling like a boss cause I'm creeping... (all)  
I can't leave drank alone  
It got me feeling  
(Feeling feeling good  
Feeling like a boss cause I'm creeping trough the hood)  
I can't leave drank alone  
You got a nigga feeling  
(Ain't even goin' to lie this drank gots me feeling  
Like I'm walking on the sky)  
  
Ya'll would think that with 3 felony cases  
I would leave drank alone  
I'm still out on bond  
And I'm a keep dranking till all the drank is gone  
Dam right I'm high as the sky be  
Over g4 and g5 that's where I be  
And then it's back to reality  
'Cause I could heare the sirens  
Woot woot dam hpd right behind me  
I got a little weed and a pint and a half  
But thanks to don I got a stash spot  
And since my doctor wrote me this prescription  
Ain't no body got to burn my ass out  
Still rolling in that three double o  
With my name in my girl on top of fours  
And I'm in love with Mary Jane and codeine  
I don't love these hoes  
I can remember my first couple I was so in love  
So when I wake up in the morning  
Before I brush my teeth I'm pouring up  
Lil momma you a dime pice  
But I'll fuck you up if you touch my cup  
Cause it ain't cheap like it used to be  
And this one cost three hundred and fifty bucks  
Me and DJ screw poured up a pint  
On my twenty second birthday  
And that day was a Monday  
But a nigga didn't wake up until Thursday  
I handle my business  
So I think I deserve to get throwed  
So I'm a walk baby now just like my nigga big moe  
  
I can't leave drank alone  
It got a nigga feeling  
(Feeling feeling good  
Feeling like a boss cause I'm creeping trough the hood)  
I can't leave drank alone  
It got a nigga feeling  
(Ain't even goin to lie this drank gots me feeling  
Like I'm walking on the sky)  
  
Sippin' on the speed tapes  
Heading to the weed place  
This boys think they ball baby  
They should see what we weight  
Some pints of that drank  
Sips of the dro  
Cups all muddy  
Told your bitch to hit it slow  
Tops down on 59  
You know I'm tippin' slow  
I could hear HAWK sayin'  
Mayne your trippin' o  
Slow your ass down mayne  
But me I'm like fuck it  
I got money in my pocket and  
Tonight it's going down  
Cause you know I like sipping  
On that purple stuff  
Purple kush in my bong  
Till the purple cross  
And the babies in the city  
Won't flirt with us  
Five kilos I'm a take  
To put in work for us  
With some down side busters  
We gon stay pouring up  
Ask about O mayne  
I stay showing up  
If I sell two million  
I got to foward it up  
If you wanna ride with money  
Then you better ride with us  
Cause we be sippin on big drank daily  
Yelling to the haters fuck you daily  
Lil o and ro we don't play G  
For real  
  
I can't leave drank alone  
It got me feeling  
(Feeling feeling good  
Feeling like a boss cause I'm creeping trough the hood)  
I can't leave drank alone  
It got a nigga feeling  
(Ain't even goin to lie this drank gots me feeling  
Like I'm walking on the sky)

[Chorus: x2]  
Creeping, with the sawed off  
In a rage, bo'guard blowing niggas balls off  
I'm the reaper, touching fellas on they lifeline  
Ain't no running to the trunk, I got my pistol right now  
  
[Z-Ro]  
Creeping with my automatic, running round  
Laying motherfuckers down, straight up causing havoc any day  
I done gone insane in the brain, motherfuckers in my face  
Claiming that I owe them something man, don't let me catch no case  
I don't really give a damn about nothing, but my Nina and my sawed off  
You can call me Deadly Head, cause I'm blowing they balls off  
Anybody bitch nigga don't test me, move across your jaw like a jet ski  
Quick jab (opening up like), Big Sab aw no  
Pulling a gun on all why'all, disrespect me and fall down  
This here my neck of the woods, where you goin' go who you goin' call now  
Military minded, I's a motherfucking soldier  
And I don't need nothing, but murder music and doja  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
[Cl'Che]  
Right now I got the shit, that'll blow your balls off  
And all this hating talking down, make a bitch want to snatch your tongue out  
I'm creepin' with the sawed off, creepin' on hoes and careful what they
talkin' bout  
I'm hitting the industry with tricks, magicians can't figure out, uh-huh  
I'm from the South, I'm breaking these bitches off  
Making the news with headlines, she's dangerous and she's out  
In your tape deck, these motherfuckers been duty click and rest  
I'm touching hoes on they lifeline, now they can't pass my check  
That's why I'm creeping with my nigga, Z-Ro a dirt dirty killer  
You heard them guerrillas, we hurt you to make you feel us  
Through all this fraud in you, you need to stay away  
Cause you don't want to fuck with Z-Ro and Cl'Che, when we ride now  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
[Z-Ro]  
Ain't no running to the trunk, I got my pistol on me  
Cause ain't no telling when a bitch nigga, try to tun up on me  
I'm coming after your camp, me and my O.G. Darrel Burton  
Thirty odd beam on the drive card, that there gon have em hurting  
In need of medical attention, lifting up motherfuckers like I'm bench pressing  
Put everybody to bed, write S.U.C. on the wall and then I'm ditching  
Out the do', firing it up with B.J. and Fo'  
Nickel and D slide in the do', that nigga there my nigga heart Lil' Ro  
Picking me bitch I'm a real one, it's gonna be hard to be takin me off the map  
Determine the real ones from the fake ones, by the way they give me dap  
Beg your pardon, if you didn't know I'm a soldier  
Military minded, clicking with the sawed off murder music and doja  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
[Z-Ro]  
Creeping deep, see how we rough in the Houston streets  
Me keep me sawed off, right next to me  
Watching a set of bitches, show they breasts to me  
With M.O.E., that be Money Over Everything  
Bet I could hit a home run, nigga let me swing  
Swinging wide, with me sawed off shotgun  
And when I pull it, that's to show you that I got one

[Z-Ro]  
Too many times I done been hated on, by 5-0  
Fuck your badge, I wish all of you bitches would die slow  
I'm just trying to survive hoe, and feed my family  
And I ain't killed nobody, but still rough is how they handle me  
I ride one deep, suspended license and all  
My middle finger out the window, screaming fuck the law  
I know what you protect and serve, not a god damn thang  
But give a nigga five years, for lessing the crowd mayn  
They got me feeling Devin, tell me why they do us that way  
The got me searching for the doja, in a doobie ashtray  
So I can cope with it, not trying to travel up and smoke with it  
My kinfolk in the maximum security, for no bidness  
Sick of I'm missing you, so here's what I'm fin to do  
Bounty hunting for badges, fuck a ditch I'ma dig a few  
The odds are against us, because we black  
So keep your heat in a stash spot, and always be strapped  
[Hook]  
Mr. officer, crooked officer  
Make a nigga want to blow the badge, off of ya  
We been living hard, so it won't be soft for ya  
Fiending to see your blood, until you cough it up  
Mr. officer, crooked officer  
We just trying to feed, our sons and daughters sir  
We been struggling to make it, in America too long  
All we want to do is live our life, and be left alone  
[Z-Ro]  
Illegal search 45 minutes, what the fuck you looking for  
I roll on 24's, so the Dopeman is what they get me for  
And that's a shame, a nigga can't ride nice  
Without getting harassed, and facing 25 to life  
I wish I could make a citizen's arrest  
Knock the busters in the hole, and blow the badges up off of they chest  
Controlled substance on the ground, and it just had to be mine  
Fucking with me about weed, and they look blacker than mine  
Six months for getting caught up, with a soldier strap  
They'll put the felonies on me, but keep your doja sack  
That's why they proud to be, an American  
What about my Negro people, look how they stare at them  
With evil eyes, they hang a brother daily G  
The Judicial system, is our modern day slavery  
We ain't picking cotton no' mo' bitch, we picking off cops  
Negro life in association, we issuing out glocks  
[Hook]  
[Z-Ro]  
I put my hands up too slow, and I got shot in the back  
Thrown in the back of the paddy wagon, left to ride in the pack  
What about my medical condition, it's some bullshit  
We don't give a damn if you die, one less nigger to deal with  
Ask me why, I don't give a fuck about the police  
Cause all they offer is the penitentiary, with no peace  
They planting dope on niggaz, just to get a commission  
And if we don't cooperate, it'll be a longer stay in prison  
Everytime I had a flat, they'd just pass me by  
And if I was laying on the ground, they'd never ask me why  
But when I'm looking great, and rolling in something they can't pronounce  
They looking for any reason, not to let a nigga bounce  
Whether expired registration, or inspection stickers  
The only thing be on they mind, is we gon get them niggaz  
And it don't matter if we working, on a 9-to-5  
We rerouted by the system, facing 99  
[Hook]

[Hook]  
Do you see, what I see  
All I do, is want to be  
Somebody, can you feel what I feel  
I try my best, to keep it real  
And pay dues  
[Z-Ro]  
Extra extra read all about it, I'm going crazy  
Ro raging with motherfuckers smoking, going eighty  
Miles per hour, pass up the city gel on my collar  
Trying to locate and half of it, that will give a nigga some power  
Not saying that I'm weak, bullets gon hang when I speak  
I bust a brain if I reach, and get that thang off my seat  
I'm in love with selling, that's why I ain't winning that much  
Gas money looking funny, wheels ain't spinning that much  
But I'ma make it the way of the other, cause I can't stop  
People trying to trick me of my mission, but I can't drop  
Cause I can't fall, run up I'ma keep bumping my lead  
Before the game over I know, I'ma be dumping my lead  
Because I'm nervous by nature, the slightest move will get you shot  
I've been known to help niggas make it, to they burial plot  
Not my lifestyle, I love the way the feddy stack  
Record labels stealing Z-Ro, to CEO gon get it back  
[Hook]  
[Z-Ro]  
Sometimes, I feel like doing myself  
Sixty percent of my body is drank, I ruin myself  
But I'm addicted, eyes fucked leaning and look inflicted  
With my facing revelations, tripping on what it predicted  
Cause it's happening, when the trumpet blow  
Ain't gon be no mo' laughing and, it's to the left or the right  
I hope I get to go to heaven, I hear heaven is tight  
Plus they tell me that hell is hot, and they won't give you no ice  
I need a cool wrist, most of these bitches be the devil trying to fool me  
Taking my kindness for weakness, and trying to use me  
Bitch fuck your hair and your nails, you bout to lose me  
I sleep with my uzi, cause she ain't gon steal from me if I nod off  
The only place I don't let her go, is in God house  
I'm a gangsta fa sho, you better believe me  
I bet I'll be on that doja, every time you see me  
[Hook]  
[Z-Ro]  
I done made up my mind  
Hustle all alone, I'm trying to get up some mo' shine  
Every time I turn around, someone bringing me down  
Got tired of em pulling on me, started slanging them rounds  
And now they thinking I'm a crazy  
Scarred and stabbed and shot, I'm still a baby, I want my mama  
Cause I'm having bad dreams, and I die in em all  
Got me ain't friendly when you see me, ain't no smiling at all  
I live the thug life, heartless and hopeless  
Laying low ducking the law, with long you lusting and acting douches  
I'm connected, my best friend use to be I-10  
Until my out of town connect, put out your chest and took my ends  
Got me throwed off in the mind, retaliation's what I take  
Fears get blowed off with my nine, incarceration's what I face  
Feel me, I done lost my mind, but it's all gravy baby  
I get tipped for knocking bustas off daily  
[Hook - 2x]

You already know who it is nigga, 'King of Da Ghetto'  
It's a new day and time but shit  
It ain't all good but shit it ain't all bad no mo' either doe  
Why'knahmsayin'? I'm tryin' to keep it civilized  
But motherfuckers keep fuckin' with me doe mayne  
  
In case you don't know my name, I'm 'bout to tell you my name  
Z-Ro the crooked, 'King of Da Ghetto' all about my change  
I remember when Joseph wasn't able to have thangs  
Now I'm able to flip a 300-M and grab grain  
There's some niggaz mad at me 'cause I got cash mayne  
I'm the future of rap-a-lot, quit livin' in the past mayne  
Remember flippin' with a brick, in the dash mayne  
Now every time I roll up bitch give me bomb-ass brain  
  
Probably be somebody, baby momma, I ain't ask mayne  
Baby, daddy got a problem, we can hit the grass mayne  
An asshole by nature, livin' in the fast lane  
Stay rilla fo' reala, fuck with me and that's yo' ass mayne  
Honor roll student, but I dropped out of class mayne  
Ain't got a diploma, but got knots of cash mayne  
To you haters I'm a waiter waitin' to serve somebody  
I kill all you motherfuckers but I  
  
Don't wanna hurt nobody, just leave me the fuck alone  
Don't wanna hurt nobody, just get me through my day  
Don't wanna hurt nobody, just leave me the fuck alone  
Don't wanna hurt nobody but a nigga might fuck around  
And bust your brain  
  
I guess they never seen a guerilla when he stompin' and pissed  
But they 'bout to see a young guerilla, whoop, they ass with his fist  
I tried to move around, motherfuckers roachin' and shit  
My attitude, fuck, watch how you approachin' me bitch  
Asshole and ain't gon' fake it 'cause I had it by nature  
And that's the result of everywhere you go niggaz hate ya  
And I ain't trippin', I'ma catch one of them marks on the back street  
With the black heat, slugs run up like a track meet  
  
I'm an anybody killa, but everybody can get it  
Servin' suckers in neighborhoods got it crackin' like a stick  
I didn't come to hurt nobody but you bumped into mine  
But we gangsters I pull a fo' and told you po' out that wine  
If I wanted flex, I coulda got a strap at that moment  
I'd rather keep ca-cash, ca-cash, 'cause I'm already wanted  
I'm an asshole by nature, my flag's on the left side  
Gave him a pass before I stepped [Incomprehensible] side  
  
Don't wanna hurt nobody, just leave me the fuck alone  
Don't wanna hurt nobody, just get me through my day  
Don't wanna hurt nobody, just leave me the fuck alone  
Don't wanna hurt nobody but a nigga might fuck around  
And bust your brain  
  
Now I don't wanna hurt nobody, but that's a lie  
Cause it's a delight for me to bust a lip or black an eye  
Or smoke a nigga like a syrup covered black 'n' mild  
So don't fuck with me when I'm tryin' to make money stackin' piles  
Some niggaz trie to rob me before, try to jack me now  
Fuck Danny Glover, I'm the lethal weapon with maxi nine  
Can't a nigga lavish any mo'?  
Without a gang of niggaz and they kickin in his do'?  
  
And nine times out of ten it'll be one of my friends  
That'll lead me to my grave, murder me to get my ends  
Do the crime and make a cape escape from my residence  
But still show up at my funeral services 'n shit  
I ain't fin' to let it happen to me, you gon' respect me  
Ain't gon' be no bad actin' with me, homie  
And to you haters I'm a waiter waitin' to serve somebody  
I kill all you motherfuckers but I  
  
Don't wanna hurt nobody, just leave me the fuck alone  
Don't wanna hurt nobody, just get me through my day  
Don't wanna hurt nobody, just leave me the fuck alone  
Don't wanna hurt nobody but a nigga might fuck around  
And bust your brain

Ha ha, 2000 and 1  
Z-Ro the motherfucking Mo City Don  
Getting off my chest, know I'm saying  
Cut these all the way off people, feel me  
Yeah, this how it go, fa sho  
  
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, fo'  
I'ma come down, it's your partna Z-Ro  
Never been a hoe, never been a broad  
Every night 'fore I go to sleep, I gotta talk to God  
One time, gotta keep it real  
Got gold and diamonds in my grill  
I'm for real, doing it like a song  
Bleeding on the boulevard, all day long  
Gots to get paid, in this damn rap game  
Gotta get my feddy, gotta get my change  
Me and my partna P-Roy, doing it every day in the struggle  
Hold up my nigga, one day we gon' bubble  
Nigga we'll shine, we gon put it down  
I'ma pimp my motherfucking pen, one time  
Hold up, nothing but syrup in my cup  
Riding on tre buck, and I don't give a fuck  
About the law, nigga fuck the FED  
I'm up in the game, just to stack a big head  
Family getting fed, me and my wife wed  
I'ma come down, I'm a Southside vet  
  
[Chorus]  
Hold it down, like the sun we're gonna shine  
And let it all swing out, I ride with Southside  
Hold it down, like the sun we're gonna shine  
And let it all swing out, I ride for Southside  
  
Like a drama bull, plus I got pull  
When you see me on the damn scene, you know I'm fool  
Popping handle bars, popping a X  
I don't give a fuck, it's feeling warm in my chest  
And I hope that God bless me, to get a platinum plack  
Ain't no turning back, once I get the stack  
Once I ain't cutting no slack, up in the game  
Said it one time, now everybody know my name  
Hollin' Ro, do another show  
Wanted me to swang down, on another 4  
Charge twenty grand, for a show  
Plus, I want half of the do'  
In this rap game, to get all the do'  
I'ma come down, I got my shine on glow  
Hollin' at the Big Steve, Mafio  
R.I.P., to the Fat Pat though  
  
Hold up, cause we balling  
See us coming down looking good, and we crawling  
Ain't falling, I ain't stalling  
Coming down outta town, birds I'm hauling  
To get paid, nigga I got my family on my mind  
I'ma put it down, that's why I'ma shine  
All in they face, like a motherfucking moon  
A star, a sun and my uzi weigh a ton  
Sitting in the microphone booth, going off  
Working with the hard, working with the soft  
In the motherfucking game, stacking my change  
I'm in the motherfucking zone mayn  
On my motherfucking block, it go down  
I'm the thoedest and the coldest, nigga there is in H-Town  
Know I'm saying, I ain't playing, steady spraying  
  
[Chorus: x3]

(talking)  
This that boy Sinner Tone, better known to y'all  
And essay is cocked strong, giving you something  
To ride and get high to, I'm chilling in the studio  
With H-Town's finest a nigga they call Z-Ro  
So go on and bump this shit, and to all you  
Niggas who I done jacked in the game  
Fuck y'all I got my beams on your ass, right  
[Z-Ro]  
Everytime you see me I'm a different nigga, but don't worry  
About my aim, I'm consistently accurate with the trigger  
My nigga don't count your chickens 'fore they hatch  
If you owe me some feddy you better pay me I'm ignorant bout my scratch  
I don't trust nan nigga cause nothing but hate they be sending me  
Can't determine my friends from my enemies  
I done had partners that done helped me when my life was on the line  
Talking about hitting me right back I'm trying to knock this bitch down  
Putting pussy before your partners disrespecting the game  
What about you broke in them titty bars be collecting your change  
Trick, nigga with all these bitch niggas are made to bleed  
Since you giving me another reason to blaze the weed  
And I don't want to do another killing, another bid  
They've been trying to give me the crack since I was a kid  
But I remain calm, pill popping smoking and leaning if I wasn't high  
I'd leave these niggas choking and screaming  
(Chorus - 2x)  
Ooh child, things are gonna get easier  
Ooh boy things will get brighter  
[Z-Ro]  
I keep my middle finger pointed out at all times, lyrically  
Abuse somebody in all rhymes, indodging in felonious to the small crime  
Everybody want to do a song with Ro, but none  
Of these niggas want to get down on a couple of zones with Ro  
Fuck rapping, I need some right now money, it's getting crucial  
I'll be jacking for some right now money  
Niggas ain't ready for the episodes that I supply  
PCP influenced, I'm relentless nigga you can die  
Fuck all these niggas and these white folks, I'm all alone  
No friends cause in the fucking end a nigga dies all alone  
About to meet my maker, I hope my life is right  
But it's hard to focus when killers try to murder me every night  
I guess this life is really hard now, fiending for the day that this war stops  
Pulling my pistol everytime a car stops  
Live by the sword, die by the sword, nigga my time is borrowed  
I paint this for another tomorrow  
(Chorus - 2x)  
[Z-Ro]  
I'm crucified by the media because I'm loved by the public  
Even though I'm rated number one keep your thumbs up and shove it  
They said I'm trying to sound like Pac is my confession to that  
Bitch I can't help it if I sound similar when I be stressing the fact  
See I'm gone scream it cause I mean it anything less ain't excepted  
The fact that I'm dark and I'm restless is no resort of living reckless  
Rest in peace to my niggas that got caught up in the struggle  
But I'm showing love to the niggas that don't want to see me bubble  
But I take that back, fuck you, I made it to the top ten on my own  
And every bitch in every city is singing my song  
Imagine that I use to sleep on a corner  
Even in year two triple O, fuck working I'm selling marijuana  
Pulling the bull up over my eyes you just can never tell  
But I know if I'm faking I try to rap now one of tapes gone sell  
I predicted being real by staying true to myself  
Now suicide is something I don't want to do to myself  
(talking)  
Year two tripple O, Z-Ro, the new motherfucking don  
Feel that, my nigga Cocked Strong from Sinner Tone  
Day one my nigga, knowI'msaying  
We gone put it down  
(Chorus - 2x)

What, is this bitch fucking with Z-Ro  
Motherfucking Mo City Don bitch  
Yeah, I know y'all hate the way we stare at y'all face  
  
[Z-Ro]  
Rap game phenomenon, lyrically I drop bombs  
With feddy up in my palms, and I show you why I'm the Don  
Z-Ro the soldier, with a chip on my shoulder  
I get you if I owe you, X your file like Scully and Mulder  
Colder with the pen pimping thang, fuck bringing it to your ass  
Me and that boy Den Den, gon bring it to your brain  
Sit back get it together, take a chill really sit back  
When I'm on swangas never hear no noise, cause them hoes don't click-clack  
I'm thinking thoed about to unload, on anything that don't mind  
Slapping patches up out your hair, better say better somebody to find  
Straight up and down and rap flawn, these jackers ain't on  
That's why I skip the slab, and I move straight to foreign  
Everybody has collided with The Screwed Up Click  
And when I pick up the mic and I go off, they say how he do that shit  
I'm a mic wrecker, about to checkmate like checkers  
A pine breasher, with 25 bags of light green on my dresser  
  
Gripping grain, my screen is gonna fall like rain  
Cause I get my-my grind and my-my shine on, I'm balling  
Crawling in the turning lane, we tipping and we earning mayn  
Cause we get our-our grind and our-our shine on, we hauling  
  
[Den Den]  
Gripping grain on the feeter, switching lanes with Aaliyah  
Top down low to the ground, car looking completed  
Balling hard like Kobe, put two inches on tobe  
Pack a seventeen shot, hope a nigga don't provoke me  
Cars they smoking, with herbal incent  
Mashing horses flipping tortoise, candy up like sip  
Beat the toll for a dolla, as I smash right under  
On the passenger of me, riding underground under  
I ponder in the game, passing laws gripping grain  
Screens fall like rain, leaving puddles and stains  
For my grind be major, hit me on two way pager  
All my tools there's a later, for a safe place hater  
So when you see me in them streets, you best bow down  
I'm gripping grain causing pain, hold it down H-Town  
Like a king or a chief, I'm blowing endo sweets  
Saving my change pushing my Range, starched up looking sweet  
  
Gripping grain, my screen is gonna fall like rain  
Cause I get my-my grind and my-my shine on, I'm balling  
Crawling in the turning lane, we tipping and we earning mayn  
Cause we get our-our grind and our-our shine on, we hauling  
  
[Z-Ro]  
Twelve inches of dope, candy coat gon float  
Got a beach house in Galveston, with woofers on bump  
And we gon choke on smoke, and swallow drank as we sail  
Atlantic Ocean the Pacific, man I'm making my mail  
From selling yale to record sales, to fatten our pocket  
Murdering motherfuckers on wax, can't nobody can stop it  
With the checks and a black X, and a rolex make niggas check  
Got my nose wide open, smelling nothing but plex  
I get deep like a dimple, complicated but simple  
From rags to riches on these bitches, Screwed Up medallion with a symbol  
Ain't no mo' chains and pieces, for my nephews and nieces  
When the record stores get empty, my ass get money increases  
You can't walk on my lawn, better leave my Vipor alone  
Got a house in Sweet Water Texas, Lexus and a pond with a swan  
They call me a swanga not a diss, I broke up on and made her bitch  
Now affiliated on a candy coated yacht, eating on shrimp fish  
  
Gripping grain, my screen is gonna fall like rain  
Cause I get my-my grind and my-my shine on, I'm balling  
Crawling in the turning lane, we tipping and we earning man  
Cause we get our-our grind and our-our shine on, we hauling  
  
Straight Profit, taking over and you can't stop it  
Cause we get our-our grind and our-our shine on, we balling  
Crawling in the turning lane, we tipping and we earning mayn  
Cause we get our-our grind and our-our shine on, we hauling  
  
Gripping grain, grind on and my-my shine on  
Turning lane

[Hook - 2x]  
Guerilla till I die, mama don't cry  
When they come for me, when I blast  
We gon see how many of em run from me  
Guerilla till I die, but I never shed a tear  
Cause they don't love a nigga here  
[Z-Ro]  
American me, could it be my own  
War is out to murder me  
I'm ready to kill, and I'm ready to die  
But have these cowards heard of me  
The rumors are real, better keep your glock cocked  
Leaving em stiffer than a statue  
Ready to defend, like a guerilla, by any  
Means that I'd murder if I have to  
Heard my homie's working as an undercover  
Ready to kiss my cheek, and earn your silver pieces  
Could it be that I've seen my last supper  
Mighty Jahova, please protect my spirit from the danger  
And I know you said you would strike down upon the  
With great vengeance and curious anger  
But don't attempt to poison your brother  
Was it nothing but the word of God  
That kept a nigga, from taking the lives of so many others  
And I'm trying to keep ways right, brothers and mothers  
I'm falling around a grave sight, pu-punk I hate you to death  
But yet I loved you so, wanted you to feel my pain since 91  
So brother come with me, and die slow  
I hate you to death, but yet I loved you so  
Wanted you to feel my pain since 91  
So brother come with me, and die slow  
[Hook - 2x]  
[Verse 2]  
As my life flashes before my eyes  
Visions of wicked ways, keep me puzzled  
Wondering why I was introduced to a life  
Filled with drama and trouble  
And everyone's always got something to say  
When I come around, when I clown  
Armed a deal, smile in my face  
And stab me in my back, when I turn around  
And I can feel hateful eyes, watching plotting to get me  
They under estimate me, hate me  
But never approach, cause they can't fade me  
And I'll be damned if I go softly, shouldn't of crossed me  
Guerilla till I die, and I'ma blast when they come for me  
Please tell me is there a place, where my guerillas could see refuge  
Cause it seems this time we gain one, as one more elute  
Whatever the rules, whatever you choose, whatever you give, I accept  
Just let me twist up, let me smoke one for the world before my last breath  
How can I go on, how can I take away my anguish  
I put a frown on my face, cause now guerillas are strangers  
And nobody knows my soul, so I show no fear  
Mobbing till I die, cause they don't love a nigga here  
[Hook - 2x]  
[Z-Ro]  
Could it be I'm too good for hell  
Heaven don't want me, because I keep slippin'  
Even though I got two clips, I still preach  
Motherfuckers around had to be Christians  
And I got a problem I suppose, but I know  
I'm gon solve it with a 4-4, ten-six on fry  
And I got 25's, hollin' I roll  
But they tell me to keep my head up and finish my tape  
Because its gon jam but I'm losing respect, my music can't hang  
Around Z-Ro, just till we praying, I really don't know  
All I can say, that I don't trust nobody on this earth  
Been that away, ever since my birth  
But its gotta stay that-a-away till I'm dying  
Innocent niggas, risen up out of my business  
Is something they better do, I'ma hit the I cut  
When a fucker rolling rocks, sold em up even  
Till I got rest, gotta put it down to the bullets  
Dump a lot of bullets, till the job done  
Till a nigga really want to, kill myself  
Nigga shut the fuck up, my record is spinning  
I'm really trying to feel myself  
Gotta get em all, gotta get em dead  
When I'm filling the bed, put a infrared to the head  
Everybody come up dead, better get on or get stole on  
Nigga better get on, but I just can't hold on  
Cause I'm ready to kill and I'm ready to die  
But next to steal, living on the motherfucking edge  
Nigga don't run up, because its real  
Nigga can you feel me  
[Hook - 4x]

[Z-Ro]  
How does it feel, when they don't believe anything you say  
Always, got to show and prove yourself every single day  
Man this ain't living, nothing but drama all through the week  
And if they don't respect my words, why they want me to speak  
I'm feeling worse, even though I put my family first  
I'm shedding tears cause I feel as if I'm headed to the dirt  
Ghetto on me, stressed out my mama buried ain't dead  
Ain't got no partners cause my partners put a price on my head  
Have you ever told a lie to make the drama stop  
Watch the world you love turn against you no more family problems  
How does it feel to be the black sheep, how does it feel to  
Victimized yourself for one time and evermore after the g  
And focus on the dresser bad, liquor approaching fast  
Sitting around, waiting on death to come, watching time pass  
My life, my life, falls under the wicked and shife  
I wonder where I got to sleep tonight, my nigga, how does it feel  
(Chorus - 2x)  
When you can't make the pain stop  
Walking in the rain so your tears can blend in with the rain drops  
When your kin people done turned they back  
Every family that I know is just like that, my nigga how does it feel  
[Z-Ro]  
I could of sworn I wasn't the only person on this earth  
But it seems, that I've been one deep ever since the day of my birth  
I'm sick and tired of being lonely in this crooked land, people think  
I'm tripping cause of my facial expressions but they don't understand  
24 years old and use to frowning daily, trying to figure out  
Who was the friend, who was the foes, you know it's bout to drive me crazy  
Mama, tell Jesus I can't handle the pressure, look at  
The way they do me down here, my vision is Z-Ro on the stretcher  
Can't I breed in peace, won't y'all leave me alone  
Like Makavelli I close my eyes and picture home  
Bout a Mo City block, a place that ain't no glocks, and it ain't no sin  
No longer watching my back for the retaliation  
How does it feel to wish that you was dead, I can  
Answer that cause many of nights my pistol's to my head  
But I'm so scared, my life, my life, 360 degrees  
Of being neglected stressing enemies, my nigga, how does it feel  
(Chorus - 2x)  
[Z-Ro]  
How does it feel, when these busters try to take your life  
Lord knows I don't want to pull my 45  
But see I'ma survive, nigga don't make me use my tool  
Get some of that bomb green from Tom 'fore I lose my cool  
How can I make to it to the top I'm like a crab in a bucket  
It got me hostile, I see my pistol grab it and bust it  
Nigga get off me, I don't love nan one of y'all  
I'm coming forward you pen and killing every one of y'all  
Call me ceaser, get em while they sleeping, I'm grim reaping  
Bust and never saw me coming left him with his blood seeping  
I'm a soldier, recognize the signs of the time  
It seems it's kill or be killed up in this stony life of mine  
Can you feel it, when it's hard to rub against a real nigga  
How does it feel, to see my blood spill my nigga  
My life, my life, feel like I'm running out of time  
Till it's over catch me running with my nine, how does it feel  
(Chorus - 4x)

[Z-Ro]  
I'm sick of being lied to, giving it my all, you know I tried to  
Maintain in the family is a must, I would of died to  
Do anything for my peeps  
But it seems they would rather see me sleep six feet deep  
But when I'm on my feet somebody got they hand out though  
That'll feel me broke the heat be hiding the rain watch me soke  
That's the millennium love if you can pay your way, maybe you can stay  
In the mean time they hate you everyday  
Want to see me and my baby girl break it off  
Haters'll stop they self-defense friends every ten minutes drop it's off  
When three's company and four is a crowd  
And my situation is seven everybody else can move around  
Look at your friends and your friends peeping, they burn bridges  
In they household, come into your home and try to repeat it  
Got you looking at your people meaning shit  
When it's over you're lonely talking about I should of seen that shit  
  
[Chorus - 2x]  
Take a look at my life, everybody around here so shife  
No love, no sacrifice, fellas in the street ain't acting right  
  
[Z-Ro]  
Watch your enemies dog, keep them close like your block  
Most of the ones closest to you cause they want what you got  
Long as you spending money on them and your buying the drugs  
They gone be down like four flats and ain't trying to budge  
Say they love you everytime you rolling up the doe-doe  
But when your ends don't spend they tend to leave you solo  
I know, that's why I love Z-Ro, cause ain't nobody else gone love me  
I think of myself, why'all don't think of me  
I'm all alone but guess what, that's alright  
Even though they use me for a punching bag, that's alright  
Even if my woman don't want me no more, that's alright  
I got Jesus and I can conversate with him all night  
Give me a split that's what I'm asking  
Cause I get reary ducking haters as they passing  
I wish I was a sociable person, but socializing ain't for me  
I want to die by myself in these streets cause that's love  
  
[Mr. 3-2]  
It ain't no love no more everybody about the dollar  
That's why when I pass by the G-O-V don't holler  
I pop my collar and don't follow nobody  
Keep god first and don't need no killumanati  
To put it on your mind cause I say on no pages  
Stacking big faces and travel to many places  
Sipping ski tastes straight out the gallon  
Why don't you take a lick and don't swallow ?  
The games is backstabbing, crooked it ain't right  
Friends or kin folk it don't matter we can fight  
It's whenever when we were boss want to do  
Cause I'ma pull dollar prime till I'm dead and I'm through  
  
[Chorus - 2x]  
[H2O]  
A lot of friends turn to foes over money and hoes  
I can't believe my best homie ain't my nigga no more  
Remember days of playing hookie in the streets for fun  
Now I'm getting dirty looks got me clutching my gun  
On the one, I'ma shine like the sun my nigga  
If I'm so low when I'm riding with some thugging niggas  
Family members even say that I ain't use to shit  
Cause I stay high all day straight abusing shit  
  
[Z-Ro]  
Cause lord knows Z-Ro ain't got no regular living  
Even though I'm, trying I feel as if I'm headed to prison  
Or headed to the grave, could it be I'm running out of time  
Feeling hopeless, I lost my mama then I lost my mind  
Will I heal in time, scarred up with bruise and shot  
But see the pain is in my brain, hitting like a stash spot  
My life, my life, full of drama and bullshit  
We burn this out of my foes pull quick, where the love at  
  
[Chorus - 6x]

[Z-Ro]  
Nobody seems to understand that my brain ain't stable  
They got me out on the ledge  
feel like I'm falling off the edge it ain't no fable  
It's reality, feel like I'm on the offensive, they trying to tackle me  
That's why I keep popping fists  
So rather relative or stranger, better keep your distance  
I can't determine friend or foe so you in danger  
Chemical imbalances of the weed and cocaine, but it really  
Don't matter to society, a nigga that got no face and no name  
Deserving more, but I'ma mob until I ain't got nothing left  
And the only thing that's promised to me is more problems and death  
Cause there's some niggas looking for me and they might be near  
And if they kill me don't shed a tear, remember I'm not happy here  
Even still, got to keep my eyes on the prize  
Although my vision is blurry I'm losing life in a hurry  
Even my girlfriend don't understand, didn't want to  
Witness the wicked so please find yourself another man, haters feel me  
(Chorus - 2x)  
This is my liiiiiiiiife  
Surviving in the struggle, living so shife  
[Verse 2]  
My opposition and proposition is scheming for cash  
And if you bitches is scandalous, I get in that ass  
So let's reliviate the pressure  
Don't try to run it's guaranteed these slugs'll catch you  
Oh yeah, I keeps a problem solver  
A pistol grip, a automatic and revolver  
Check it, and I'ma handle up baby  
It's in my nature it's a must it ain't a maybe, peep game  
The feds taking pictures, and tapping my phones  
But if I catch you bitches snitching best believe me it's on  
I analyze of this realize and open fire on bitches  
And if I catch you bastards slipping I'm leaving bodies in ditches, huh  
I bet that ass can pass it  
Your life span it ain't long, you in a casket, check it  
Niggas rushing your ass, mob deep with ski masks  
Busting shots on the road trying to make your car crash, this is my life  
(Chorus - 2x)  
[Z-Ro]  
These boys be telling me they got love, giving me false-i-fied tapping, but  
I know they wouldn't give a fuck about me if there wasn't no money in rapping  
See I know they want to get rich off me understand, even if I was  
To die I still can talk they still put a mic in my hand  
For trying to copy my style of life, pretending like they from my block  
While I survive on willing to live while they depend on mom and pops  
Before you make your move, check yourself and giving me for the millions  
For the love of the struggle and just can't take it cause you not real  
You want to be dead, there's gone be a dentist to see  
When a nigga be scream and hollering I'm godfather  
But I guess it's just the menace in me, plus  
The only nigga that's skipping me from clicking is Herman Fisher  
Relocated the killers and gats and drinking and if and burning swishers  
Why they want to play with my life, they got families, nigga I don't  
The only thing between me and them hoes  
Is I'ma keep thugging they timid ass won't  
Will they mind they own god damn business and keep they self out of mine  
Because of a thin line, between handling business  
and boo yeah coward a nine baby  
(Chorus - 4x)

Smoking nothing but pine, need no drama on my mind  
Pump your breaks, bet not disrespect the stop sign

Ooh child, things are gonna get easier  
Ooh boy things will get brighter  
(Z-Ro)  
After living through drive-by's got a nigga ready for war  
500 push-ups everyday to keep my knock out punches up to par  
Cause everybody want to test me, knocking them down punching  
But they want to bust will I fight to jump so would the lord bless me  
To keep on breathing leaving niggas unconscience  
When I'm punching I'm going hard in the paint, so pack a lunch  
To the niggas that we killing don't feel like you the only motherfucker  
That really don't think we even love eachother  
Gorilla till I die for real murdered by my right hand man  
Or prosecuted by the white man's hand  
I don't think I'm living to die, but I'm dying to live up under the stress  
Fin to lose my cool so come out even to have you rest  
All my sins are forgiven for living violently  
With a gun in my hand, I'm creeping up on them moving silently  
They left my peope alone when my cutlass exploded on the side of the road  
The motherfuckers thought I died in the load  
(Chorus - 2x)  
(Z-Ro)  
Am I the hunter or the most hunted  
telling my people they don't need a high to get by  
But I'm telling a lie cause I'm the most blunted  
Hard to practice my preaching when I'm under the stress  
And I'm walking around with a 12-gauge sawed off  
and a suicide note up under my vest  
I want to live in peace but drama won't allow me  
That's why my mind is gone, I'm seeing x's and tylenol three  
But do you really want to see a nigga with the vendetta  
Make everybody kill somebody I'm a trend setter  
First I was spending my time with family mobbing showing my brother's love  
Never thought it would it happen to shoot first releasing my brother's blood,
uh  
Why do these rookies want to rumble, got to do him in  
Even if he's my kin that's the only way the cookies crumble  
Calling up on your name in vain, this time I took a bow  
But if there was ever a time I needed you god I need you now, lord oh mercy  
Cause I don't wanto to die by the hands of my own kind  
Really to get true to the overdose and free my own mind, hell yeah  
(Chorus - 2x)  
(Z-Ro)  
I no longer need the weed to reach another level, I'm on a natural high  
But I looked the devil in his eye, thinking the song I'm a survivor  
Things ain't what they seem my yellows are green  
People are demons, demons are people in my dreams, what does it mean  
I'm trying come out of this motherfucking nightmare  
Going against all odds but mama said they never fight fair  
Somebody put a price on my head for living dead  
Hoes was capping but now they in my bed, but they choosing to giving me head  
Rags to riches, sagging the creases in my breaches  
66 Impala candy dancing playing with he switches  
Finding away from righteousness and learning to sin  
You'd be the same nigga that's kicking the door with me that's turning me in  
Uh, why do the fiends buy dope from me they know they don't get high from me  
Why do the fiends buy dope from me knowing that they gone die from me  
A nigga was plexing with my partner why did he pull his gun  
Now everybody related or cool with you can die that's on my son  
(Chorus - 4x)

Ever since my early teens I've been a loc on these streets  
'Gold is for twenty four I go for broke on these streets  
My flow is a young Mike Tyson I put the hit on niggas  
And even when I'm countin' off I still spit on niggaz  
No super friends I smoke purple stuff alone in my room  
That cush made me leave my body I was gone in my room  
Mad swangas, to mo no blocks, I switch cars like socks  
Either it's somethin' with the roof missin', or a hard white top  
  
Remember me, I'm the one they laughed at in all my classes  
Now what they spend on a house I blow on designer glasses  
Even without a platinum plaque, this ain't cappin',  
I'm just tellin' you what my life like, so this ain't rappin'  
Don't you ever tell the captain, that my money ain't right  
I'm a have to pay money, to spray money, cause money ain't right  
No more throwin' no bodies, so I can stand on these streets  
I got an army behind me, cause I'm the man on these streets  
  
I did some time locked down, but now I'm back on these streets  
Here to save ya'll from all this wack rap on these streets  
I left ya'll with I'm still livin, provin' I wasn't dead  
If you wonder why I'm out early, my lawyer got his bread  
Much love to my industry homies, who didn't forget about me  
Paul Wall, Pimp C and my partner Flip-eraci  
  
But since I do business with Rap A Lot the feds watch me  
But I'm like Shaq up under the backboards you can't stop me  
When I was hustlin' no police could find a rock near me  
Now that I ain't hustlin' they can see all of my rocks clearly  
B S foldas, ava smokas, these are of Joseph  
Known to catch you in the club flee and make women wanna come closer  
Homie don't get it twisted cause you see me on a poster  
You disrespect me, the magnum come out the holsta like it's 'sposed ta  
  
[? ] man on these streets  
I don't give a fuck cause I'm the man on these streets  
I'm a hitman, whatever I'm aimin' at I hit man  
After I hit her she can't stand up without a kickstand  
Not a special kind of fool, just hit her with the mule  
If she find the itch to set me up, I'll hit her with the tool  
I got a daughter to raise, I ain't tryin' to leave  
Plus all this money I'm makin' you think I ain't tryin' to breathe  
Inhale exhale... now that's better  
Over eight hundred thousand independent now that's cheddar

Pain, my middle name  
Lord please have mercy on my soul, I can't maintain  
Pain, my middle name  
Lord please have mercy on my  
  
[Z-Ro]  
I haven't smoked a sherm in 27 days  
When I'm under pressure, I feel it's necessary to blaze  
Looking at my life as if I wasn't here, why the fuck that picture be so clear  
Since my nigga died, I done slowed down on drank  
But I'm right back heavy on beer  
Stained finger tips and lips, cause smoking come with murders  
Fiending for heaven but I wonder, if I'm worthy  
Please God forgive your servant, and your man child  
But the fact that he got Jordans, and a nigga like me  
Grow po' wings was bullshit, so I ran wild  
Wasn't I good enough, to get some shit like that  
It was only a grade, you know I didn't deserve to get hit like that  
My life my life, falls under the wicked and shife  
I gotta pay my rent, therefor my partnas might be targets tonight  
Even though I'm grown fucked up childhood, keep fucking my dome  
Fuck around and front, like I'm gon  
Buy your work, and straight leave on your song  
If a nigga take me out it's all good, cause I've been fiending to leave  
My life is fucked up, and I'm tired of having to drink to a G  
  
[Chorus]  
Pain, my middle name  
I must learn to live again, but existing in such a strain  
Pain, my middle name  
Lord please have mercy on my soul, I can't maintain  
  
[Z-Ro]  
Now I done had pistols to my head befo'  
Woke up with a dead body, in a bed befo'  
Don't ask me why, only talk to Z-Ro  
I'm noid, never trust friends they don't love us  
They front like they your homies, but they bury motherfuckers  
Dog I'm going through it daily, fiending for a killa to take me out  
What am I living for, nothing but a record label huh break me out  
I'm so sick and tired Lord knows, I'm sick and tired of this pain  
But steady keeping the world, I'm no preaching through the rap game  
The most evilest niggas nightmares, of my fondest dream  
Cause death rules everything around me and the cream, is a cup of lean  
Having a case of flashbacks, of the good time  
But then I remember, it wasn't no good time  
Just poverty stricken, and kicking it in the hood time  
24 and I still can't think, from Guerilla Maab to Point Blank  
To Big Moe to Z-Ro, and still no bank  
I gotta be paying dues, for my niggas that lost they life in the game  
Cause the more I struggle for happiness, nothing but pain  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Z-Ro]  
Dorothy Marie or mama, I've been stressed, learning to live  
A life of misfortune, my feet have been so swollen from my quest  
I'd like to find the meaning of sick and tired  
Plus I can't determine between a bitch and right  
Even my friends are fake, that's why I'm quick to ride  
I'm the shit bitch, I know you smell the odor  
Them other two niggas ain't bitches, and it's had a chip on my shoulder  
I love my cousin and my brother mayn, but see it ain't nothing but drama  
When you live in a slum, across the street from the gutter mayn  
I'm 'pose to be a rap star, dig these blues a nigga ain't  
Seen the states in two months, I'm in the kitchen as a crack star  
What a wonderful way, to spend my fucking album release  
A promotional show, and I must get do' nigga I got ounces to cheese  
Ounces of green, I got mouths to feed so I need G's  
Plus my own shit the T.V. in the living room, is Mexican D's  
Gotta be paying dues, for my niggas that lost they life in the game  
More I struggle for happiness, nothing but pain  
  
[Chorus]

[Chorus - 2x]  
All my niggas stay alive in this dirty game  
Niggas working 9 to 5 in this dirty game  
But all my niggas gone survive in this dirty game  
Because we pack a 45 in this dirty game  
[Z-Ro]  
Everyday my mind is set on money making ways  
Even kick in doors, I can't be broke in money making days  
I can't get no job in a white man's world that's why I live so raw  
I can't watch my children starve homeboy so watch me break the law  
[Chorus - 2x]  
[Z-Ro]  
Ramon noodles, t.v. dinners ain't no way to live  
Rather be holding slab while grabbing grain rolling airport load for sive  
In the streets of Houston Texas hustlers living in the cuts  
On a mission chasing paper got no time for gold digging hoes get off my nuts  
[Chorus - 2x]  
[Z-Ro]  
I'm turning suicidal in my older age, this game'll freeze you to death  
And eveyrday I face the coldest stage  
Tell me does every nigga that's thugging got to struggle to bubble  
And so I'm ready to laugh successfully you don't want no troule  
Cause I'm living more rugged than rougher than the rockiest road  
I'm paronoid for life, got to keep a glock in the load  
Am I addicited to caine (watch that tooting line)  
Could it be a nigga that's hard to locate is somebody you could find  
Z-Ro, certified platinum on a million dollar paper chase  
Pulling up next to the police and blowing this weed in they face  
But they try to blow my high when I'm on this hyper toiliking weed  
But I'm gonna slice skills with hands that'll make you vomet and bleed  
Aunte be worrying about me so I'm trying to get her to smile  
But I know she know I'm wanted dead or alive  
Got to keep my mind on my money making maneuvers cause my hustle is strong  
A lot of fools get lazy now they hustle is gone  
But I'm a hustler for life  
[Chorus - 2x]  
[Z-Ro talking]  
Nigga hell yeah, know what I'm saying  
Bridgemont Texas baby coming straight at you  
Motherfucking 199 motherfucking 7  
For real we ain't even gone play with you nigga

Yo hey, yeah come here girl come on, uh..  
  
[Hook: x 2]  
Who want to party party, these hoes acting naughty  
They want to get with it, or they want to fuck somebody  
And so you know how I do it, you better ask somebody  
  
[Daz]  
I pick winners, let me see you come in first place  
I'm like the rabbit and turtle, see it's a long race  
You get to shaking and moving, working and hurting  
You slapping it up and you bruising, and girl it's curtains  
  
Shake your booty, leave my hand  
And dick print in her, and I go up in her  
She get managed, like the Asian wanting Spanish  
And you know I got to have it, put your mouth on me baby  
  
Get to fucking, and baby girl can't manage  
She can't stand, her ass bigger than the whole damn planet  
She don't look to better, like Janet  
But she'll do, and we'll do  
  
It's just another day, a bitch in my bed  
The same bitch, she be giving me head  
And when the bitch, make a nigga just cum  
Find out hoe, that you ain't the one  
  
[Hook: x 2]  
  
[Cl'Che]  
You want to party party, see me act naughty naughty  
And get me twisted off that Lime, Vodka and Bacardi  
You want to see me now, or you want to see me later  
Smoked out, in the back of your Navigator  
  
So let's party party, young playa playa  
I don't mean to stare, but what you swanging there  
I like to get it crunk, I'm tal'n bout pulling stunts  
Don't be shy break me off, in the front of the club  
  
You know, you want to fuck  
You know, you want to bust a nut  
So come on baby, why don't you give me what you got  
Break me off a stack, and you can see this pussy pop  
  
And if you front, you get's no love  
Cl'Che's looking for a thug  
You with that ladi-dadi, but I'm a hottie hottie  
Then Daz Dilinger said, you better ask somebody  
  
[Hook: x 2]  
  
[Z-Ro]  
Bitch you, ain't nothing but a greasy split  
Open your pussy hole for me, don't tease me bitch  
I'm put to put this log on you, from Michigan to Pamona  
Long as I got a rubber, Z-Ro gon bone a broad a day  
  
When I hit it, she gon injure her ankle like Hardaway  
Doggy style, come out and come back from a yard away  
Punish the panocha, I'm going south  
Do that thang with your mouth, and I'll be hard all over  
  
Look how they jock me, when I'm rocking the stage  
On that X and I'ma hit it, like I'm cocking a gauge  
I'm like em with hair down they back, or rocking the braids  
They love my dick, and want me to stay in they cot for the day  
  
But I got bidness to handle, and paper to chase  
Finish sucking my dick, and then get your ass out my face  
It ain't nothing personal, but I don't love you hoe  
You got some bomb ass pussy, but you got to go  
  
[Hook: x 2]

[Z-Ro]  
They say he was flipping out till, losing control of his mind  
Moving fast, in a world that ain't ready for the pace focussed on his grind  
Who am I to test, Z-Ro I bet everybody in Ridgemont 4 know me  
Feel what I say up under the evidence is still your homie  
You must of forgot about the days until you be in 94  
When it was 72 where partners sagging creases to find a hoe  
Now they can't look me in the eyes, cause they might tell on theyself  
About having something to do with trying to riddle my number one partner to
death  
You want to get even with me boy clear you can see me with a rap  
But I'm about gangsta shit so bow before you see me with a strap  
Cause I've been silent for so long, it's about time I broke the ice  
Nobody want to box me why everybody want to pull a trigger to take a life  
I'm down with crews cause everybody else is fake to me  
Niggas with plex against me, they all cakes to me  
And everybody want to be talking about they real and they got love  
But motherfuckers don't love Z-Ro unless I got drink and I got bud so I got
plex  
(Chorus - 2x)  
Who's next to plex you want to test  
Better have your life right in the bottle of your vest  
Cause I'm also stressed, sometimes I wonder if I'm plexed  
Thinking hit me will I have to put my homies to rest, plex  
[Z-Ro]  
Regular candy in river rain, we came to deliver pain  
One hitter quitters and eagle talons up in your liver man  
I came to bring the pain, all the way from the south to the west  
Every one of my bullets are looking residence so they gone house in your chest  
A nigga done been through so much shit the last five years of my living  
Now a days the bitches are realer than homeboys so here's to my women  
But then again I'm all alone I don't depend on a soul  
Independently made a million then I took my benz on a stroll  
Now everytime I come around my partners treat me like strangers  
Never thought it would come to this I got to keep one in the chamber  
What makes real niggas turn into hoes and make niggas go fraud  
When it comes to me whether rapping them off to see this nigga go hard  
Now everytime I come around my partners treat me like strangers  
Never thought it would come to this I got to keep one in the chamber  
What makes real niggas turn into hoes and make niggas go fraud  
When it comes to me whether rapping the gangsta shit this nigga goes hard,
plex  
(Chorus - 4x)  
Plex, time to have plex  
Ra-ta-ta-ta-ta from the barrel of me tech  
[Z-Ro]  
Rolling by my motherfucking self you don't want to plex my friend  
Fuck around with me and you might never breathe a breath again  
Cause a nigga might shoot you in a place where it takes longer to die  
And you know what they say no pain no gain  
I guess you fin to gain your heavenly high  
Marcus I see you when you shoved that pistol up in his nose  
Pulling the trigger my nigga blood was dripping all out on his clothes  
Do you think that I'm suppose to sit back and charge it to the game  
That's why your baby mama house went up in flames you know my name  
I wish I would of been strapped cause my partner would of still been alive  
I would of ran up on your ass and I would of dumped and you would of died  
Since a nigga can't change the past I'ma knock your ass up out of the future  
I use to be down to dump side by side with you but you forced me to shoot you  
Too many of these boys be bulletproof, that's why they like to compete  
But run your badass over Ridgemont you be dead before you get to Ridgecrete  
You think it's a game, but I've been working on a straight aim I'm ready to
kill  
If I can't get to myself when you want to get leid by set of bitch got skills  
(Chorus - 2x)  
Plex, time to have plex  
Ra-ta-ta-ta-ta from the barrel of me tech  
Cause I'm also stressed, sometimes I wonder if I'm blessed  
Thinking deeply will I have to put my homies to rest  
(Chorus - 4x)  
Plex, time to have plex  
Ra-ta-ta-ta-ta from the barrel of me tech

Mo'fucker when we bang bang, squeezing pistols that make em bang  
Haters smoking that swisha swisha sweet boy, switching damn lanes  
Pulling guns and put two in your stomach, nigga who want it  
Gangstas, if you with me gangstas  
Smoking that sticky you get pissy, riding spinners  
Tires glimmer the prize in our eyes, nigga ride with us  
Nom and Z-Ro like when Tino and DeNiro, counting Kilos in casinos  
They gambinos, for them see-notes man  
Hustlers, serving customers  
Off of his back shit cause, then we bust them guns  
  
Up jumps the boogie, cause the track is so thoed  
Got me breaking down bubble gum, I'm fin to be so blowed  
Nothing but clouds in the sky, but it's still sunny  
Cause I'm puffing on some good green, pocket full of money  
Southside, I'm wrecking for where I lay my head at  
Disrespect me, you the nigga I'ma spray my lead at  
I'm living for today, don't give a fuck about tomorrow  
I'm robbing you motherfuckers, it ain't no need to borrow  
Money from dad, that nigga wouldn't lend me no cash  
Seventeen he threw me out, like the trash  
It's all gravy baby, I'm connected with the street my mama Ridgevan  
And daddy East and West, Cancel Creek the dopefiends love me  
I got a cousin, named Mard  
Everytime I bring him outside, suckers be running up in my yard  
Smartest thing I got is a 20, and you could get a whole sale  
If you want it soft, let me run back to the motel  
  
Running to the ceiling, what it's fin to be  
Blowing cigarillos, no more swisha sweet  
But regular weed, a gangsta fa sho I am  
(are you gon make it to the top), nigga you know I am  
Flipping in a four do', trying to get some mo' do'  
Playa don't get mad, if you see me flipping with your hoe-a

Hell yeah nigga, ay yo  
  
[Z-Ro:]  
Remember me, when I use to write my rhymes in class  
At Dick Dall Middle School, all them niggaz would laugh  
Telling me I would never make it, cause I rap too fast  
I was desperately trying to find out, how to go from scraps to cash  
Remember, how y'all use to chase me home from school  
Just cause I sported corduroy britches, and Pro Wing shoes  
I use to have a lunch card, cause them times was hard  
Since the seven people living in one house, with no cars in the yard  
I remember stressing so hard, I couldn't keep my focus  
My only love was for extras, and overs  
Fuck all you niggaz, don't make me slap the fuck out all you niggaz  
If it ain't related to making paper, I ain't calling you niggaz  
I bet Mo City remember, when I took it over with rapping  
51-11 Ridgevan, moving that crack bitch I was stacking  
Residuals redeemingly, I was raw mayn raw caine  
Rapidly running my neighborhood, I was the law mayn  
'Member when I dropped my first album, in '98  
Fucking with Herman Fisher, but now that nigga hate me he's a cake  
Suppose to be mad at me, tal'n bout I owe him some change  
Nigga just mad cause they can't eat with me, I eat with Lil' James  
Rap-A-Lot Mafia my man, y'all remember the Maab  
This isn't Den-Den and Z-Ro, y'all better remember the squad  
Two different labels but the same cable, remember we connected  
Woodfair to Missouri City, two block of Screwed Up Texas  
  
[Hook: x2]  
Remember me, I'm the one they laughed at in all my classes  
They use to rank on my low budget clothes, and my glasses  
Remember me, the same one they use to call egghead  
Now I play with fed bread, and sleep on Gucci bed spreads  
  
[P.O.P.:]  
I remember the winters in the hood, no heat cold nights  
No gas no lights, a ghetto low life  
So my flow twice as strong, from the memories  
I remember when my closest homies, turned to enemies  
See niggaz tend to be, down when your bread up  
But when you in the quicksand, they frown cause your legs stuck  
Yeah I remember that, so you remember this  
Hard times be my fuel, so I ain't finna quit  
I vividly, R-E-M-E-M-B-E-R  
Craig up in the E-R, bloody getting CPR  
So before, the reaper come and turn me to a memory  
I endlessly spit the heat, for the people to remember me  
Me P.O.P., so many forgot bout  
But not I, this for those who remember little Popeye  
And I remember hot guys, ridiculed the flow  
Now I'm front and center nigga, haters finna do me so  
  
[Hook x2]  
  
[Bun B:]  
Shit I remember back in the game, it was tough  
No matter what a nigga had, it was never enough  
See if I had five I wanted ten, and if I had ten I wanted twenty  
Fuck having some, shit I wanted plenty  
Back in the gap, when I first hit the block  
With my first 25, and a hand full of rocks  
Posted up at Samantha house on the West, on the porch  
Ready to give my nigga some work, or give him the torch  
I remember telling my T, I wasn't going to college  
And was headed to the streets, to get the rest of my knowledge  
That broke her heart, and for that I had to go  
So I went from the sidelines, to starring in the show  
Everything came slow, and nothing came fast  
Most times I was out of luck, and dead on my ass  
But with the heart of a hustler, and the mind of a G  
I came up, now I'm something to see Bun B  
  
[Hook x2]  

[Z-Ro talking]  
Yes indeed, H-Town, it go down Lil' Flex, Z-Ro, Big Mello  
Know what I'm saying, you boys can't stop us man  
Unstoppable, feel me, yeah  
They got to feel us till they kill us, this for the radio  
  
[Lil' Flex]  
Ain't nothing but a g thang baby  
Turnel sets dried yellow bones crazy  
Can't fade me, died lately  
Pulling out the escallade or a mercedes  
Trunk popper, show stopper, drank sipper  
Rule number one is to never tip a stripper  
And I know a lot of why'all want to wish me trouble  
Went from swanging hoo-doos to a bentley bubble  
Image is everything, diamonds in every ring  
Piece and chains that hang down low to my dang-a-lang  
Stop that, cop that, I'm a baller baby  
Got the rims that poke out on the prowler baby  
I'm the same young cat that dropped the jewels on them  
Next year I'm about to drop 22's on them  
From the Mo to the Fo, back to airport landing  
Diamonds speak for theyself, Flex so outstanding  
  
[Chorus]  
Still standing, and you know we represent the south  
And ya know ya know we represent the south  
Still standing, we in the door and these haters can't keep us out  
  
[Big Mello]  
I represent that S-O-you-T-H to the S-I-D-E  
Drop screens you can see me completely  
Off the heezy, fa sheezy I'm breezy  
Cause my diamonds they be known to blind hoes like Stevie  
Believe me, outstanding with my family  
From me and Z-Ro and Lil' Flex at the grammy  
Boss player from Texas, you could tell by the necklace  
We gone break these hoes on four's now we frozen the Lexus  
My protected, move around, get around  
Come through show some round when we hit your town  
It go down, whoa now, school slow down  
Watch these fours roll down crawl down your block  
Top drop, trunk knock, glock cocked  
And these shops gone bop, it don't stop  
Won't stop, how it go down  
Harm clock, Mo City, south west still shine, wooo  
  
[Chorus]  
[Z-Ro]  
Screwed up representer these fellas don't want none  
From the land of the trunk poppers where ballers blow tons  
We stacking funds, and living our life out on the run  
In search of a platinum plack trying to get stacks it just begun  
If you talking down move around we ain't having that  
East and West took it before but see we came to grab it back  
Can't see us like cataracts, off in our natural habitat  
That's the studio and bro you know ain't no more selling crack  
Ain't nothing but rocking trash talking on down to the ain't that  
Cause I'm a veteran to this here ever since the days of the Wave Band  
When I was knee high to a grass hopper but now we roll on chppers  
Me and Gene hovering over the ground in candy helicopters  
Now we platinum status without driving a dodge stratus  
Keeping it gangsta energy instinct with a heater to protect us  
Man it's third coast, to me our music mean the most  
Big Mello and Lil' Flex and Z-Ro the crooked as your folks and we  
  
[Chorus - 2x]

[Z-Ro talking]  
Yes sir, Z-Ro, Lil' Keke, Screw to Mo City  
CMG, KMJ, this how it go  
  
[Chorus]  
Sunshine, living in the ghetto daily trying to find  
Sunshine, trying to make a million hustling got to dodge  
One time, I keep my head up even though I feel like giving up  
Sometimes, Keep your head up trying to find sunshine  
  
[Z-Ro]  
Man what happened to the sun on my lawn it's so gloomy and grey  
I got a feeling 5-O gone try to do me today  
Nothing but backstreets for me cause I don't need a vacation  
Looking for front run up that seem the only compensation  
The hood is on fire, other soldiers won't let it down  
They ain't set tripping but out here jacking has been alive  
Misery spinning what they clicking for no reason at all  
Even intentions of stacking paper they pleasing them all  
And outside, smelling like nothing but formaldrahide  
It's an everyday suicide, R.I.P. to the ones that died  
Wake up before you get caught up don't keep on selling your soul  
Until your life fall up, you got to try to find  
  
[Chorus]  
[Lil' Keke]  
We living in a world that's dirty and so shife  
You trying to figure out this the game that's called life  
These days is cold and got me searching for my soul  
Like paper bags and lawn chairs man you unfold  
I'm looking out my window for some, sunshine  
I'm trying to give it up cause I swear it's my time  
I five petreat and start thinking about my sins  
Roll up another square and start thinking about the benz  
Talent and skills is what I'm bringing  
New homes and microphones got the cell phone ringing  
Push play on the deck, to let my mind collect  
And try to mash on the gas with no time to sweat  
This the ghetto, and that's all I know  
Another episode from the young don and Ro  
If the family is tight, then everything's alright  
So quick to catch flight for the sunlight, uh  
  
[Chorus]  
[Z-Ro]  
Seem like I can't stand the rain prosecution and struggle up in my brain  
Got to tell me slow down if you can see all of my veins  
Cause I ain't having none of that riff raff to get back and blood  
Keep my enemy close to me cause your killer be your 'cause  
I wish I was, able to socialize with why'all  
Instead of trading war stories and taking lies from why'all  
It's how it be though, Lil' Keke and Z-Ro we on the grind  
Long as they talking about us, we know we staying on they mind  
Don't hate us congratulate us, why why'all turning up why'all nose  
Cause it's been we be spittng straight be burning up why'all glow  
Want to take it away from pin and pad and pick up a gun  
You better repent my dog it's over, you done better try to find  
  
[Chorus - 2x]

[Z-Ro]  
Since I been out by myself, I keep that bitch Nina with me  
If you my enemy, you don't want to be the last nigga that seen her with me  
Z-Ro haters be making my attitude, rude  
Fuck around and get stole on, if you fuck up my moves  
Dude, finally I found myself, I had to stop  
Blowing that kick em cause eventually I would of drowned myself  
Already need a anger management class  
See if a busta cross me, it don't matter the situation I damage his ass  
Soldier that's what I be, so bitch  
Why you trying to play me like a H-O-E  
Turn me loose so I can make it to the T-O-P  
It's like I'm in a bucket full of see-are-A-be 's, but I keep climbing  
And I keep on rhyming, while they be bumping they gums  
Looking at my diamonds whining and blinding, no dumping they guns  
Cause they can't see me, bitch I'm invisible to the hate  
Thugged off in my kitchen, cutting chemicals in my cakes  
[Chorus]  
Talking down on me from a safe place, now I'm in your face  
What you gon do now  
Barrettas and Rugas on my person, they would do ya if I burst em  
What you gon do now  
Mo City my block showing no pity for cops, if you trespass  
You done fucked up now  
No busting in the sky first one through your thigh, second ones a chest blast  
I done lucked you out now  
[Z-Ro]  
Niggas be cool in my face, but hate behind my back  
Talk down on me in front of me, but not behind my gat  
I bet you won't do that, I bet you scared of that iron  
Perpetrating like you a gorilla, selling drinks in line  
You ain't never seen the Pen nigga, the penitentiary  
They talk rehabilitation, but look at what it did to me  
I smoke mo' and sip mo', than ever before  
Motherfuckers be on my nerves, so I lean on that dro  
Trying to keep on dropping a bomb, on the bitch-made  
Don't be looking surprised, y'all made it this way  
I got a Vendetta with lifts, that be trying to sink me  
Sending police after me, and trying to link me  
To aggravated robbery, and strong-arm jacking  
Trying to throw me off my note, so I can't do no stacking  
Johnny Cochran over lawyer got me out on bail  
Looking for niggas that was plotting on receiving my mail  
[Chorus - 2x]

[Z-Ro]  
Houston Texas is my city, Ridgemont 4 is my block  
I put my trust in no man, only my motherfucking glock  
Cause she ain't never let me down, before  
Fuck a gang I follow my bitch, cause she be busting rounds for Ro  
Unlike my homies, cause they phony than a motherfucker  
Even my broad, cause she might be fucking some other brother  
Lord knows, that I couldn't take it if I found out  
Premeditated, cause I'm about to let them automatic rounds out  
A prisoner of my own mind, losing it swiftly  
Clicking on motherfuckers, until the reaper come and get me  
Fuck a friend and a click, and a partner in crime  
Cause when you doing your bid, they won't be partners in time  
I bet they be the main reason, why you locked up in a county  
That's why I strive, to keep all the busta bitches from round me  
So take it how you want to take it, i don't give a damn  
I'm an asshole by nature, nigga this is who I am  
[Hook - 2x]  
I know they told y'all, deep down South we don't play  
Don't get too close, cause nigga I'm gon spray  
Everyone of y'all, piss me off and you gon see me touch  
Your noggin y'all, that's who I am nigga fuck you  
[Z-Ro]  
Don't worry my nigga, I'm coming to make your bail  
Wait a second, how this buster know I'm going to jail  
I seen the hatred in they faces, when the prince wanted to see me  
When they thought I was leaving, they wanted to D-E-A-D me  
Dropping salt on my name, saying I sold my soul  
And these suppose to be my people, damn my people so cold  
Why not be happy for a nigga, when he make a major move  
Chill you playing with this game, but I've been paying major dues  
I can't tell a motherfucker, how to fly a plane  
If I ain't never been up in the cockpit, you feeling me mayn  
I got a bunch of records sold, and y'all ain't sold shit  
Your foreign's at a standstill, but my Houptie's on the road bitch  
Beef with me nigga, and you can find out  
How I murder niggas with my lyrics, I ain't gotta pull my iron out  
Take it how you want to take it, i don't give a damn  
Fuck them niggas who say they down, one deep is who I am  
[Hook - 2x]  
[Z-Ro]  
I'ma follow the truth, and never follow lies  
So I'ma ride on Watts, until his fat ass apologize  
For saying what he said, about Screw  
Look who your style is named after motherfucker, you number two  
And you know what come before one, nigga this mouthpiece  
Z-Ro and S.U.C., Southside super hero  
Fucking with you pussies, cause it's time you be tampered with  
When you see me look me in the eyes, and pull up your pamper bitch  
My nigga named Tommy, say he's coming to get ya  
His people gon be swinging, everyone of em'll hit ya  
Holding on to my grudges, until my brain get a blister  
I love drama so much, because my life is so rough  
So when you see me out in public, don't you come at me wrong  
Disrespect me if you ain't, hoe I'ma fuck up your dome  
You can take it how you want to take it, I don't give a damn  
Street Military was my father, Z-Ro is who I am  
[Hook - 2x]

(talking)  
Look out man, quit tripping man, how you gone tell me  
To choose between you and the streets, don't you know  
If I leave the motherfucking streets alone  
How are we gonna get the rent paid and the  
Motherfucking bills paid, knowI'msaying  
You got to cover my eyes remember  
[Z-Ro]  
Baby stay down with me through thick and thin, and I promise it's gonna pay
off  
Though hurts you like a sailor cause baby you need to stay soft  
You took me on a ride, without no breaks to mash  
The things you do it make the average nigga hate your ass  
But I just love it when you cuss at a nigga, when it's all good  
In the bed when your finger nails clutching a nigga  
You said you'd always be there, and not to worry about a thang  
But when I started to struggle you left a nigga to hang  
What kind of shit is when you want to see your woman tonight  
On top of that there was no food, phone, water or lights  
I had a state be thought of suicide, nobody could move it  
You took the pistol from my head when I attempted to do it  
Baby I know that I be tripping sometimes  
It's just because I never owned anything that's mine  
Understand my situation and be patient and we'll make it in the end  
Want you to be the first to ride around in my benz  
baby to know me is to love a thug  
  
(Chorus)  
Forgive me baby I'm a thug  
I make all my money from selling all these drugs  
I'm in it to win it and I don't want to lose  
But I slowed down my hustle cause I'm digging you  
And I, won't keep on hogging you  
Even though you're the only girl I'm talking to  
I'm in it to win it and I don't want to lose  
But if I lose you, it's all a part of paying dues  
[Z-Ro]  
We went from good to better, better to worse then we separated  
I should of beeped you to apologize but I guess I changed  
Cause I be feeling like you wanted to end  
Don't want to be your enemy baby, but I can't be your friend  
Female associates are gone, miss, I loved you  
And treated your kid as if he was my own kid  
So if you think I was affatuated, bet one hundred see-notes  
That I show you what it is to be broke  
When I was ready to misbehave and get paid, my nigga run at me now  
Knew it was peticular car cause I got you on my mind  
Even all the days of my life I want you staying with me  
But the way it's been it don't get gravy until you laying with me  
Cause we be at eachother's thugs like we were crypts and bloods  
Always the first to say I'm sorry grab your hips and shove  
I want to kick it but I got business to handle with my crew  
Call me later when you ready to say I do  
baby to know me is to love a thug  
(Chorus)  
[Z-Ro]  
Forgive me baby I'm a thug, what happened to all the capping  
Now that I'm rich you want to greet me with kisses and hugs  
I had to stop chasing you, I chose to chase my feddy  
Now I get promenade in an escallade, and be low keyed in my cheve  
Now you looking like you want to curse  
Never put trust in the woman or a nigga, only put trust in my verse  
Cause if it is well then I'll understand  
if you ain't helping me making you could find another man  
I'll get my pen and she is number one in my state  
Got ladies looking from me head to chest then the navel  
Willing and abel to be dedicated from the heart  
Must of mistaken me for yourself that's why I cheated from the start  
Freaky in the dark, baby I bet I make you cum  
And if your nigga don't like it, I bet I'll make him run  
I bet these bitches be tripping over the way I run through em like socks  
Like them old niggas run through throw away glocks  
Should of known me is to love a thug  
(Chorus)

Just want to let em know (we ballin)  
You gotta strap up cause niggas'll test you  
Whenever you feel that pressure  
You let em know everyday of your life is, check it  
  
For real we still killin' 'em and, each one of 'em  
You know the flow like caine, look it's numbin 'em  
Look what I done to them, they want run wit 'em  
I let 'em stay few nights but then I'm done wit 'em  
Mami you rollin', get your clothin'  
You know one sight of the mansion will get 'em open  
I back out my garage wit, new Ferrari  
Cause I been pimpin this game since Atari  
You hardly, ever see me loving a hoe  
I tell a bitch, I'm in love wit my doe  
Cause I'm pimping and, niggas is bitchin' and  
We was the pharmacy now you want prescriptions  
Think I'm slippin', like I don't grip again  
Go 'head trip it ain't nothing to drop a clip again  
Got my dogs to catch me when I'm fallin'  
Pass the weed and hennessy, I hear it callin'  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Nigga we ballin', ready for war and  
Pass the weed and hennessy, I hear it callin'  
We ballin', ready for war and  
Pass the weed and hennessy, I hear it callin'  
  
Yeah, I take a sip of that henny I load that tec up  
I hit the block wit the medicine give 'em check ups  
You see I'm vest up, I'm ballin' at war  
These niggas want to see me off, they don't want to see me on but  
Proof I'm ballin', I put a eighth  
Of that white down in my hood, I can finish it by the mornin'  
Re-up by noon, re-kick at night  
Half these dudes doing bids couldn't live my life  
And you youngn's in the hood want to be like P  
Cause every new gat I cop it begin wit a P  
Like, P-89 you niggas' P-92 shit  
You know how dudes "This Proof ain't for that bullshit"  
And these hoes want to roll wit a G  
But once I hit 'em wit that G, I have totin' the P, cause!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yo I hear 'em callin, and every city I travel  
Hoes get at 'em when they see a nigga ballin'  
Keep the steel wit me, couple of killas from the hood  
Who blew bail, but still they keep it real wit me  
We ride out (and?) we find out (where?)  
Your little address (and?) blow out your hideout (yeah)  
Who want war? hoes they tellin' me "E's you ain't right"  
Like this year I'm goin' go South Pole  
This for them haters think I'm slippin', I ain't  
When I find 'em hiding I tie 'em, they be missin' like weight  
But wait, lil nigga don't be missin' my point  
I don't miss when I point, niggas get killed off point  
And you see, I school a little you, forfeit the game  
I was young, just like 'em, Jay taught me the same  
But I see he hard headed, told em stay in his lane  
Cause them OG's home and they layin wit K's cause  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Nigga, pass the weed and hennessy I hear it callin'
