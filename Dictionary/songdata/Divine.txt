Cheap, cheap  
I was born to be cheap, cheap  
A child no mother could keep, cheap  
As sure as there's trash  
I was born to be cheap.  
  
I was born to be helpless, I was born to be cold  
I was born to never do what I'm told  
I was to be shallow, wasn't born to be deep  
Of all the things I was to be cheap.  
  
Cheap, cheap  
I was born to be cheap, cheap  
A child no mother could keep, cheap  
As sure as there's trash  
I was born to be cheap.  
  
I was born to be crass, a loud brassy tart  
No one can accuse me of having a heart  
I was born to fast  
I don't do it twice with anyone, get cheap!  
  
Cheap, cheap  
I was born to be cheap, cheap  
As I'm walking down the street, cheap  
I'm always too much  
I was born to be cheap.  
  
I was born to be helpless, I was born to be cold  
I was born to never do what I'm told  
I was to be shallow, wasn't born to be deep  
Of all the things I was to be cheap.  
  
I'm cheap  
I was born to be cheap, cheap  
A child no mother could keep, cheap  
As I'm walking down the street, cheap  
I've always wanted to be cheap  
I was born to be cheap

I'm all dressed up and ready to fall in love.  
Are you ready heels? Stop stomping!  
  
Here I am looking for crime I'm looking for some action  
What I have a million times will give you satisfaction  
So don't you mess around with me you won't know what to do  
'Cause I'll put on my cha cha heels and walk all over you.  
  
Chorus  
Gimme gimme cha cha heels.  
All I want is cha cha heels  
Gimme gimme cha cha heels  
If I don't get my cha cha heels

Dressed up just for trouble to do what must be done  
I'm gonna burst your bubble, the fun has just begun  
So don't you mess around with me you won't know what to do  
'Cause I'll put on my cha cha heels and walk all over you.  
  
(chorus)  
  
I'm all dressed up and ready to fall in love!  
I'm all dressed up. Gimme Gimme Gimme!  
  
Going back to Boise I'm itching for a fight  
I'm looking for a lover who loves my dynamite  
So don't you mess around with me you won't know what to do  
'Cause I'll put on my cha cha heels and walk all over you.  
  
(chorus)  
  
Are you ready heels? Stop stomping!

1 Love ain't like no fairy tale  
  
It'll break your heart  
  
'Cause it don't always have a happy ending  
  
Love ain't like no fairy tale  
  
It'll break your heart  
  
'Cause it don't always have a happy ending  
  
Mama said you better watch yourself  
  
When you flying high on the wings of love  
  
Keep your balance or you just might fall  
  
And if you fall you gotta be strong  
  
'Cause love ain't like no fairy tale  
  
Repeat 1  
  
Every time I see you 'round the way  
  
I start thinking about yesterday  
  
A picture perfect world is what I saw  
  
A picket fence, a house, a fancy car  
  
No, no, no, no, no, no  
  
I just knew that you were heaven sent  
  
You would make all of my wishes come true  
  
You'd be my knight in shining armor some day  
  
I was your princess soon to be queen  
  
Love ain't like no fairy tale  
  
Repeat 1  
  
I just knew that you were heaven sent  
  
You would make all of my wishes come true  
  
You'd be my knight in shining armor some day  
  
I was your princess soon to be queen  
  
Repeat 1 until fade

You say that you'll be mine forever  
Although I don't know why  
But if you want to be my lover  
Don't waste my time  
  
I see you out with her around in town  
Each and every day  
But if you want me you must prove yourself  
Give her up today  
  
Chorus  
Give it up, baby give it up  
Give it up, then you can call me up  
Give it up.  
  
Although it's only from a distance  
I've had my eyes on you  
I'm sure you realize the problem  
It's dealt to you  
  
I was not asking much to leave her out  
But everything you do  
And if you ever want somebody else  
I'll find someone too.  
  
(chorus 3x)

Tried to get away from you  
When you said that I was wrong  
I tried to get away from you  
But your hold is much too strong  
  
You've got a magic spell on me  
And there's nothing I can do  
You've got a magic spell on me  
And I can't get away, get away from the....  
  
Chorus  
Hard, hard magic, hard magic you do  
Hard, hard magic, hard magic with you  
Shake, shake I could break everytime  
Think, think give or take, losing my mind  
With all the hard, hard magic, hard magic you do.  
  
I tried to break away from you  
But I didn't wanna fight  
I tried to break away from you  
But your grip is much too tight  
  
You've got a magic spell on me  
And I'm stuck to you like glue  
You put a magic spell on me  
So I can't get away, get away, from the...  
  
(chorus)  
  
I've tried everything I know  
I don't think I like your hard magic  
I've struck every single blow  
But the spell is much to hard for me  
  
Oh my, I'm not scared, go away  
Not another night with vampires  
Hey is your bite any worse than your bark?  
Oh, how divine, keep howlin' baby!

I want a sure shot, worm that's going tough  
I want a sure shot, who'll love me when I'm rough  
I want a sure shot, fireing through the night  
I want a sure shot, who'll always do it right.  
  
Caress me, undress me, fill me with desire  
Do the kind of things to me that set my heart on fire  
  
(repeat)  
  
Hey you! Get on the floor, it's only natural love  
Hey you! I'm getting hot, it's only natural love  
Hey you! Spin around, it's only natural love  
Hey you! It's only natural love.  
  
I want a sure shot, worm that's going tough  
I want a sure shot, who'll love me when I'm rough  
I want a sure shot, fireing through the night  
I want a sure shot, who'll always do it right.  
  
Caress me, undress me, fill me with desire  
Do the kind of things to me that set my heart on fire  
  
Hey you! Tantilize, it's only natural love  
Hey you! Mesmorize, it's only natural love  
Hey you! Satisfy, it's only natural love  
Hey you! Get on the floor, it's only natural love  
Hey you! Spin around around, it's only natural love!  
  
Take your time, harden up, it's only natural love  
Take your time, you'll feel sublime, it's only natural love  
Take your time, you're doing fine, it's only natural love.

I tried to get you out of my head  
  
But the more that I tried  
  
You're back in my mind again  
  
I must admit that I only got regrets  
  
Since you walked out on me  
  
Took my life my love and my happiness  
  
I'll always be thinking of you  
  
Wondering if you ever think of me too  
  
How I hope and I pray that someday  
  
I'll hold you in my arms again  
  
1 I wish that I had you in my arms again baby  
  
I'll hold you so tightly boy I can't pretend  
  
That I don't love you, don't need you  
  
The pain never ends  
  
Who's gonna love me like you do  
  
When nights are cold I can't help but shed a tear  
  
When I recall all those precious memories we shared  
  
You'd hold my hand and make me feel so safe and warm  
  
I'll tried to move on  
  
But you still have my heart and my soul  
  
I'll always be thinking of you  
  
Wondering if you ever think of me, too  
  
How I hope and I pray that someday  
  
I'll hold you in my arms again  
  
Repeat 1  
  
There will never be another you  
  
You have changed my very existence as it were  
  
Don't you know I love you more  
  
I love you more, love you more  
  
Than you'll never know  
  
Repeat 1 until fade

Shake it  
Shake it  
Shake it  
Shake it, shake it  
Shake it, shake it, shake it  
Shake it, shake it  
Shake it, shake it, shake it  
  
Out  
Out tonight  
Feel like going out  
In the night  
I'm gonna walk the street  
Walk the street  
I wanna feel the heat  
Feel the heat  
There ain't nobody better than me  
Can't you see?  
Look at me!  
  
Wild  
Feelin' wild  
And I'm burnin' up  
Deep inside

Let it go  
I'm gonna steal the show  
Steal the show  
There ain't nobody better than me  
Can't you see?  
Look at me!  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm so beautiful  
You gotta believe it, I am beautiful  
I'm so beautiful  
Can't you see?  
Look at me!  
I said  
I'm so beautiful  
Well, everybody's welcome to his point of view  
We're all beautiful  
Can't you see?  
  
High  
Feelin' high  
I'm really gonna shake it  
Through the night  
  
I'm gonna nail the beat  
To the floor  
I'm gonna make you scream  
Scream for more  
  
There ain't nobody better than me  
Can't you see?  
Look at me!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There ain't nobody better than me  
Can't you see?  
Look at me!  
  
CHORUS  
  
Can't you see?  
Look at me!  
Can't you see?  
  
High  
Feelin' high  
I'm really gonna shake it  
Through the night

To the floor  
I'm gonna make you scream  
Scream for more  
  
There ain't nobody better than me  
Can't you see?  
Look at me!

Lately (I've been watching you)  
Been thinkin' 'bout you baby  
(and everything you do)  
Just sittin' away watching the days go by  
Just sittin' away watching the days go by  
  
Have you ever felt a breeze hit hard,  
Like the wind was blowing it apart  
As you're spinning like a merry-go-round,  
Indications of a storm touching down  
Wish that I can wear the rain and storm,  
But I guess it was heart break from the norm  
Was a day I will always remember,  
The saddest day in sweet November  
  
Lately (I've been watching you) been thinkin' 'bout you baby  
(And everything you do)  
Just sittin' away watching the days go by (2x)  
  
Baby I'm on my knees praying God help me please,  
Bring my baby back, right back to me  
If lovin' you was right then I don't want to go wrong  
So I drown myself with tears,  
Sittin' here, singin' another sad love song  
  
Lately (I've been watching you) been thinkin 'bout you baby  
(And everything you do)  
Just sittin' away watching the days go by  
Just sittin' away watching the days go by  
  
Lately I've been torn apart,  
I wish you hadn't broke my heart  
I'm missin' you babe,  
Missin' you every day  
Lately I've been torn apart,  
I wish you hadn't broke my heart  
I'm missin' you babe,  
Missin' you every day  
Lately (i've been watching you) been thinkin 'bout you baby  
(And everything you do)  
Just sittin away watching the days go by  
Just sittin away watching the days go by

Chorus  
Baby you're just a little baby  
You pretend to be a lady  
But you're just a little baby  
  
Bored of the sitter will go to the bidder, the highest  
If you discover that he's undercover, his stained kiss  
Pull out your heartstrings and take all the other things for granted  
Remember yourself before all the other ideas have been planted  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Right from the start I saw you play the part in rehearsal  
You chose the mood and decided to move in the circle  
How does it feel when you spin on the wheel of destiny  
You feel good tonight but tomorrow you'll wake up dishonestly  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
He took you for a lover  
But then you found another  
And now you're asking me  
What should I do?  
  
I won't try to stop you  
I think you want to grow  
In the arms of someone new  
Maybe in time you'll return to him  
And maybe in time you'll see the best  
Changing the cast, erasing the past

Love reaction

When you know she can't be found,  
Through the times your feelin' down,  
You know my love, my love, my love, will be around,  
Any time you need a friend,  
And your girl won't let you in,  
You know, my love, my love will always be right here.  
  
Every time I see you with tears in your eyes,  
I get so upset,  
'Cause I know in my mind she's why your down,  
But I can't say one word,  
'Cause I know you know that your girl is hurting you,  
  
You need to let her go,  
She never wants to be around

But you know...  
That I'll be there for you.

You know, my love, my love will always be right here.  
  
Every time I see you kissin' her so sweet,  
I get so mad,  
'Cause she don't deserve all the love that she receives,  
But its not my place to ruin your happiness,  
'Cause your tellin' me its love,  
  
Then why are you never happy?  
She hurts you,  
And it hurts me too  
To see her put you through this pain,  
But I'm a let you know...  
That I'll be there for you.  
  
When you know she can't be found,  
Through the times your feelin' down,  
You know my love, my love, my love, will be around,  
Any time you need a friend,  
  
And your girl won't let you in,  
You know, my love, my love will always be right here.

Had enough danger  
And people on the streets  
I'm looking out for angels (Angels)  
Just trying to find some peace  
Now I think it's time  
That you let me know  
So if you love me  
Say you love me  
But if you don't  
Just let me go 'cause  
  
Teacher  
There are things that I don't want to learn  
And the last one I had made me cry  
So I don't want to learn to hold you touch you  
Think that you're mine because it ain't  
No world for an uptown girl  
Whose teacher has told her goodbye  
Goodbye, oh goodbye  
When you were just a stranger  
And I was at your feet  
I didn't feel danger  
Now I feel the heat  
What look in your eyes  
It's telling me no  
So you think that you love me  
Know that you need me  
I wrote the song, I know it's wrong  
Just let me go  
So I don't want to learn to hold you, touch you  
Think that you're mine  
No world for an uptown girl  
Who just isn't willing to try  
I'm so cold inside  
Oh maybe just one more try  
One more try to ease my mind I feel so cold inside  
One more try to ease my mind I feel so cold inside

I just got into this town  
But it already seems such a bore  
Not what you call a small town  
But I've seen a hundred like it before.  
  
So don't try to take advantage  
I just want you to show me the sights  
My temperature's up, my energy's high  
Gonna cause an explosion tonight.  
  
Chorus  
Show me around, I'm looking for a lover  
Show me around, I've seen it all before  
Show me around, I'm searching for a brother  
Going over the top and I sure as hell ain't going alone  
  
I'm not staying forever  
Just long enough to see a little more  
I might be new to this place  
But I ain't new to the score  
  
So don't try to take advantage  
Thought I ain't one for acting coy  
I'm gonna dress up  
I'm gonna show you tonight  
That I ain't no country boy  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
So don't try to take advantage  
I just want you to show me the sights  
My temperature's up, my energy's high  
Gonna cause an explosion tonight

Oh how she tried to cut him down to size  
Telling dirty lies to his friends  
But his own father said give her up, don't bother  
The world isn't coming to and end, he said...  
"Walk like a man, talk like a man my son  
No woman's worth crawling on the earth so walk like a man my son"  
  
Bye baby, I don't mean maybe  
Gonna get along somehow  
Soon she'll be crying on account of all her lying  
Oh yeah just look who's laughing now. He's gonna...  
Walk like a man, fast as he can, walk like a man from you  
He'll tell the world "Forget about it girl, I'd walk like a man from you."  
  
Oh how she tried to cut him down to size  
Telling dirty lies to his friends  
But his own father said give her up, don't bother  
The world isn't coming to and end, he said...  
Walk like a man, talk like a man my son  
No woman's worth crawling on the earth so walk like a man my son
