Blue moon  
You saw me standing alone  
Without a dream in my heart  
Without a love of my own  
  
Blue moon  
You knew just what I was there for  
You heard me saying a prayer for  
Some one I really could care for  
  
And then you suddenly appeared before me  
The only one my arms could ever hold  
I heard somebody whisper please adore me  
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold  
  
Blue moon  
Now I'm no longer alone  
Without a dream in my heart  
Without a love of my own

Ooh ooh ooh Nobody knew her name  
But she turned up just the same  
  
There was a knock on the door  
  
A thump on the floor and the party turned insane  
  
As she called out her name.  
And she walked in looking like dynamite  
  
She said now come along  
boogaloo through the night  
And by the way she's moving well  
  
Dynamite might she not with all  
she's got she's got the whole town lighting up dynamite  
Nobody quite knowing what to do  
  
Wrong or right  
  
But they all know Dyna is Dynamite  
And they're right.  
She hadn't been there long  
When she told us where she came from  
  
There was a flash in the sky  
  
A light in her eye and her dynamite light burned on  
  
As the music went on and on and on and on . . .  
And she walked in looking like dynamite  
. . .

From a Jack to a King.  
From loneliness to a wedding ring.  
I played a Ace and I won a Queen,  
An' walked away with your heart.  
  
From a Jack to a King.  
With no regrets, I stacked the cards last night.  
And Lady Luck played her hand just right:  
You made me King of your heart.  
  
For just a little while, I thought that I might lose again.  
Then just in time, I saw the twinkle in your eye.  
  
From a Jack to a King.  
From loneliness to a wedding ring.  
I played a Ace and I won a Queen,  
You made me King of your heart.  
  
For just a little while, I thought that I might lose again.  
Then just in time, I saw the twinkle in your eye.  
  
From a Jack to a King.  
From loneliness to a wedding ring.  
I played a Ace and I won a Queen,  
You made me King of your heart.

You laughed with me, I laughed with you  
You said that you already knew  
You looked at me, I looked at you  
And there was nothing I could do  
What to do, after all you put me through  
Ooh ? ooh, ooh, ooh  
You're hypnotic when you touch  
Your hypnosis is too much  
And you burn me with your hypnotistic fire  
You're hypnotic when you feel  
Your hypnosis is too real  
And I hope you're not a hypnotistic liar  
You captured me, I fell for you  
Now I've got nothing left to lose  
You walked on me, I let you do  
Whatever you must put me through  
Put me through, now what have I done to you?  
Ooh ? ooh, ooh, ooh  
You're hypnotic when you touch  
Your hypnosis is too much  
And you burn me with your hypnotistic fire  
You're hypnotic when you feel  
Your hypnosis is too real  
And I hope you're not a hypnotistic liar  
You're hypnotic when you touch  
Your hypnosis is too much  
And you burn me with your hypnotistic fire  
You're hypnotic when you feel  
Your hypnosis is too real  
And I hope you're not a hypnotistic liar  
You're hypnotic when you touch  
Your hypnosis is too much  
And you burn me with your hypnotistic fire  
You're hypnotic when you feel  
Your hypnosis is too real  
And I hope you're not a hypnotistic liar

I couldn't wait, she came in late,  
She wasn't there, I didn't care.  
I'm sinking low, where can I go?  
Has no one goit a bed to share?  
  
I spent a night on the tiles.  
A night on the tiles.  
  
Here comes the day, what can I say,  
She really knows that I've been cheating.  
The night was long, she came on strong,  
It's morning that we'll soon be greeting.  
  
I spent a night on the tiles.  
A night on the tiles.  
  
If only I could lay with you by me,  
I'd never leave your side again.  
You'd make me feel a man and then...  
  
She left for good, I knew she would.  
There's nothing for me here at all.  
Why did she go, I'll never know,  
How come she had to be so cruel.  
  
I spent a night on the tiles.  
A night on the tiles.

Chorus  
  
Chorus to fade

On the banks of the river stood Running Bear,  
Young Indian brave.  
On the other side of the river stood his lovely Indian maid.  
Little White Dove was her name.  
Such a lovely sight to see.  
But their tribes fought with each other  
So their love could never be.  
  
[Chorus]  
Running Bear, loved Little White Dove  
With a love as big as the sky.  
Running Bear, loved Little White Dove  
With a love that wouldn't die.  
  
He couldn't swim the raging river  
Cause the river was too wide.  
He couldn't reach his Little White Dove  
Waiting on the other side.  
In the moonlight he could see her  
Blowing kisses across the waves.  
Her little heart was beating faster  
Waiting there for her brave.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Running Bear dove in the water.  
Little White Dove did the same.  
And they swam out to each other  
Through the swirling stream they came.  
As their hands touched and their lips met  
The ragging river pulled them down.  
Now they'll always be together in that happy hunting ground  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]

You can dance-every dance with the guy  
Who gives you the eye,let him hold you tight  
You can smile-every smile for the man  
Who held your hand neath the pale moon light  
But don't forget who's takin' you home  
And in whose arms you're gonna be  
So darlin' save the last dance for me  
  
Oh I know that the music's fine  
Like sparklin' wine,go and have your fun  
Laugh and sing,but while we're apart  
Don't give your heart to anyone  
But don't forget who's takin' you home  
And in whose arms you're gonna be  
So darlin' save the last dance for me  
  
Baby don't you know I love you so  
Can't you feel it when we touch  
I will never never let you go  
I love you oh so much  
  
You can dance,go and carry on  
Till the night is gone  
And it's time to go  
If he asks if you're all alone  
Can he walk you home,you must tell him no  
'Cause don't forget who's taking you home  
And in whose arms you're gonna be  
Save the last dance for me  
  
'Cause don't forget who's taking you home  
And in whose arms you're gonna be  
So darling,save the last dance for me  
Save the last dance for me  
Save the last dance for me.

Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh  
The secrets that you keep  
I've only got myself to blame  
I played a losing game  
I lie awake and call your name  
All I own is just a picture in a broken frame  
It seemed so hard for me to share  
It's even harder now that you're not there  
(Now baby)  
I'm losing sleep over the secrets that you keep  
(Oh baby)  
I'm losing sleep over the secrets that you keep  
I lie awake at night not knowing where you are  
You know it don't seem right  
That you could be so far away from me  
Oh oh, the secrets that you keep  
Since you've been gone our worlds have grown apart  
Now I don't know what's in your head or in your heart  
Those little things you kept so secretly  
They don't mean much to you but they mean so much to me  

I hurt your feelings when I said you're kinda green  
Of an age that's in between and you don't know what love mear  
You think you love me maybe love has made you blind  
'Cause you're full new emotions of a young and foolish kind.  
  
Show me you're a woman  
'Cause a woman has the kind of a love I'm a-needin'  
Show me you're a woman and I'll show you that I'm a man  
Just give me what I'm after  
It's a smile and the sound of your girlish laughter  
When you are a woman  
I'm your man.  
  
Don't try to fool me ''cause I know about your age  
And it's written on a page of the memories that I've saved.  
I know you're only trying hard to do what's right  
But you're young and so you might have to wait for Cupid's bite.  
  
Show me you're a woman . .

Yeah, yeah  
  
All night long, you've been looking at me  
Well you know you're the dance hall cutie that you love to be  
Oh well now, you've been laying it down  
You've got your hips swinging out of bounds  
And I like the way you do what you're doin' to me  
  
[Chorus]  
Alright  
That's right, that's right, that's right, that's right I really love your
tiger light  
That's neat, that's neat, that's neat, that's neat, I really love your tiger
feet  
I really love your tiger feet  
Your tiger feet  
Your tiger feet  
Your tiger feet  
Well alright  
  
Well flash your warning lights just as long as you like  
I know you're aching to be making me tonight  
I've got a feeling in my knees  
It's a feeling only you can please  
There ain't no way I'm gonna let you outta my sight  
  
[Chorus]  
  
That's right, (that's right), that's right, (that's right)  
I really love your tiger light  
That's neat, (that's neat), that's neat, (that's neat)  
I really love your tiger feet

Well alright well now, you've been laying it down  
You've got your hips swinging out of bounds  
And I like the way you do what you're doin' to me alright

tiger light  
That's neat, that's neat, that's neat, that's neat, I really love your tiger
feet
