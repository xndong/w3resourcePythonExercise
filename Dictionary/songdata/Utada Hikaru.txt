Somebody out there better get this  
Not many people can do it like this  
How about some speakers to amplify me  
How about a rhyme to fortify me  
Life's messy so I clarify it  
Simplifying things for everybody  
  
I need someone who's true  
Someone who does the laundry too  
So what you gonna do  
Please don't forget to follow-through  
I take my diamond shoes  
Someone who tries to be on time  
Do what you said you'll do  
I hope you like to follow-through  
  
All that I need's a bit o' practice  
My mind is set on bigger business  
This is not a time for reminiscing  
This is something new and interesting  
Why are you trying to classify it  
This is music for all humanity from me  
  
Dreaming of hip hop tunes  
They say you've got the proper tools  
So what you gonna do  
Keep doing things the way you do  
I take my diamond shoes  
Someone who tries to be on time  
Do what you came to do  
I came to see you follow-through  
  
I need someone who's true  
Someone who does the laundry too  
So what you gonna do  
Please don't forget to follow-through  
I take my diamond shoes  
Someone who tries to be on time  
Do what you said you'll do  
I hope you like to follow-through  
  
DVD's of Elvis Presley  
ABBC Sessions of Led Zeppelin  
Singing along to F. Mercury  
Wishing he was still performing

I'm playing back  
The melody you hummed  
Because you couldn't whistle  
The motion of your tears  
Passes through the air  
At the moment you lightly touched my arm  
The sun is bright  
And I turned my eyes away from your signal  
Because I've been alone  
The stars are too wide  
Give me another chance  
When our hearts overlap, it will rise  
Like a color pattern  
With a feeling this natural  
There's no way it can be mistaken  
When I look at it from the gap in my memories, it vanishes  
That pattern  
No matter how far we're separated  
There's no reason for you to give up  
No matter how much you push me away  
I can't hide it  
Now, throwing away my pride  
I'll beg of you  
When I awake from dreaming  
If you're there for me  
Oh, I need nothing more  
Even the weakness hidden by the sun  
Which I understand for the first time  
If we can be together  
I'll become strong  
Give me another chance  
I'm searching for you, my dear  
In the circle shaped pattern  
Inside the endless maze  
I want to come a little closer to you  
In this daily battle  
I can't convey it  
No matter how tightly you hold me  
I have no way to reach you  
When our hearts overlap, it will rise  
Like a color pattern  
With a feeling this natural  
There's no way it can be mistaken  
When I look at it from the gap in my memories, it vanishes  
That pattern  
No matter how far we're separated  
There's no reason for you to give up

I can't help but feel alive.......  
Yeah...  
You pick up the phone on the seventh ring  
Even if I don't say my name  
You know who it is by my voice  
The melody that falls naturally from my lips  
But I was most happy when I lost my words  
Even on days when I have problems  
When I see you, they all fly away  
On my rainy days, when I can't see you  
Just by hearing your voice, automatically the sun will shine  
It's automatic, just by being by your side  
Just by you looking at me with those eyes  
The excitement won't stop  
I can't say no  
I just can't help it  
It's automatic, when I'm held by you  
It seems like we're in paradise  
Shining brightly  
I close my eyes and soon I feel so good  
It's automatic  
Your ambiguous attitude still makes me uneasy  
So being this infatuated with you  
Is still necessary for a while  
Even on the days when your kindness was hard to bear  
You always told the truth  
On rainy days whe I can't cry alone  
If I touch my ring, look, the sun will shine  
It's automatic, just by being by your side  
My whole body gets warm  
I can't hide my excitement  
I can't even take a breath  
I just can't help it  
It's automatic  
When I access it  
I try to touch the glittering words  
Inside the computer screen and I feel so warm  
It's automatic, just by being by your side  
I don't think you're beloved, just necessary  
It's not because I'm sad  
I just need you  
It's automatic, when I'm held by you  
It seems like we're in paradise  
Shining brightly  
I feel so good  
It's automatic...  
I just want you here with me  
Tell me why  
It's automatic  
Automatic......

Hello my name is Utada like dadadada  
For your information I am here to take it higher  
Do you like the way I shine like fresh like it's a fire  
Music is my business and I'm here to pour it on ya  
  
When I like it, I don't hide it  
Got to have it  
I can't help it, it's  
Automatic  
Ripe and ready, call me crazy  
Got to love it  
And you know it, it's  
Automatic  
It's automatic  
It's automatic  
It's automatic  
I can't help it  
It's automatic  
It's automatic  
  
When I like it, I don't hide it  
It's automatic  
It's automatic  
It's automatic  
  
When I see a microphone I got get it, oh  
Capricorn, Aquarius, what a good sense of humor  
Find out all about me on myspace and my news letter  
I'll be glad to add you but I won't give you my number  
  
Philanthropic, diabolic  
So melodic  
I can't help it  
It's automatic  
Vodka tonic, Califunky  
Contraceptive  
When I'm on it, it's  
Automatic  
It's automatic

It's automatic  
When I like it, I don't hide it  
It's automatic  
It's automatic  
It's automatic  
  
Candy lane, Pacific, Arctic, and Atlantic ocean  
You can be my Captain and I'll be your Commander  
Do you like the way I rhyme, it's pretty darn clever  
You could be a virgin now I'm with high intention  
It's automatic  
It's automatic  
It's automatic  
  
It's automatic  
It's automatic  
It's automatic

I want to be closer to your ideal  
I can't be a good girl Can you keep a secret ?  
  
Hit it off like this  
Hit it off like, this oh baby  
  
You still can't read the signals I've been sending from here.  
Come on.  
I'll get it across, I'll stop, just hide it away  
Until I can't runaway anymore.  
I'll believe, that's no good, cause I still don't wanna believe it.  
I want to be closer to your ideal  
I can't be a good girl Can you keep a secret ?  
I'm not sad when you're here.  
Can you keep a secret ? Can you keep a secret ?  
I can't be closer to your ideal.  
I can't change that quickly, Can you keep a secret  
Cause I'll call to you when I'm sad  
Can you keep a secret ? Or do I have to keep it secret ?  
  
Hit it off like this  
Hit it off like this, oh baby  
Even when you're by my side,  
I'm looking for a round about way to express it.  
If you don't want this puzzle to go unsolved.  
Won't you come on  
A faint sound  
The moving shadow giving chase  
A shadow that won't leave us alone.  
You'll need to be a bit adventurous and have the courage to hurt.  
I want to be closer to your ideal  
I can't be a good girl Can you keep a secret ?  
I'm not sad when you're here.  
Can you keep a secret ? Can you keep a secret ?  
I can't be closer to your ideal.  
After this there's no going back, Can you keep a secret ?  
Show me, that you're not going to go and blab it to everyone.  
Can you keep a secret ?  
Or do I have to keep it secret ?  
  
I've kept it quiet all this time,  
Don't tell anybody , Can you keep a secret ?  
I'm not sad, cause you're here.  
Can you keep a secret ? Can you keep a secret ?  
Even if I promise not to hurt you,  
Who knows really ? Can you keep a secret ?  
I'm not sad, cause you're here.  
Can you keep a secret ?  
Or do I have to keep it secret ?

English Translation:  
While worrying about the illusion  
Reflected in the mirror,  
Everything speeds up without notice  
When they say I'm free to go wherever,  
The guides for my incomplete desire  
All turn grey.  
The swaying flames  
Are painting my dreams tonight  
The tip of your brush  
Isn't dried up yet?  
If you can't see a blue sky, open up your blue umbrella.  
Isn't that great? The canvas is yours.  
A white flag is only raised when one has given up.  
But now let it be crimson  
Like the beckoning matador.  
Under the discoloring fluorescent light  
On the black and white of a chessboard  
We met by chance  
There was a time when we'd lost our way and held each other close  
It's been a month since then. Do you remember?  
I would have been happy just to have watched  
The orange sunset next to you.  
But the mouth (words) is the origin of catastrophe  
Black clothes are only worn when  
Praying for the deceased.  
The mark of rouge leaves behind deep red purposely.  
If you say you can only paint  
Dreamless pictures  
How many times must  
I paint over the canvas?  
A white flag is only raised  
When you've given up  
I'm a color you don't know now.  

The rain falls on my windows  
And the coldness runs through my soul  
And the rain falls, oh the rain falls  
I don't want to be alone  
I wish that I could Photoshop  
All our bad memories  
Cause the flashbacks, oh the flashbacks  
Won't leave me alone  
  
If you come back to me  
I'll be all that you need  
Baby come back to me  
Let me make up for what happened in the past  
  
Baby come back to me  
I'll be everything you need  
Baby come back to me  
Boy you're one in a million  
Baby come back to me  
I'll be everything you need  
Baby come back to me  
You're one in a million (One in a million)  
  
Lower East Side of Manhattan  
She goes shopping for new clothes  
And she buys this and she buys that  
Just leave her alone  
I wish that he would listen to her side of the story  
It isn't that bad, it isn't that bad  
And she's wiser for it now  
  
I admit I cheated  
Don't know why I did it  
But I do regret it  
Nothing I can do or say can change the past  
  
Baby come back to me  
I'll be everything you need  
Baby come back to me  
Boy you're one in a million  
Baby come back to me

Everything I ever did  
Heaven knows I'm sorry babe  
I was too young to see  
You were always there for me  
And my curiosity got the better of me  
Baby take it easy on me  
  
Anything from A to Z  
Call me what you wanna babe  
I open my heart to thee  
You are my priority  
Can't you see you've punished me  
More than enough already  
Baby take it easy on me  
  
Baby come back to me  
I'll be everything you need

Dirty desire [Repeat: x3]  
  
There's something that's been growing inside of me  
Uh uh, baby baby, uh uh baby baby  
I haven't been myself since we met last week  
Uh uh, baby baby, uh uh baby baby  
  
When I'm alone at night  
I sit and fantasize  
And in my fantasies I love you long time  
Doing my nine to five  
I'm thinking six and nine  
I gotta make you mine  
Can you feel my  
Dirty desire?  
My  
Dirty desire?  
My  
Dirty desire?  
  
Can you feel my  
Dirty desire?  
My  
Dirty desire?  
My  
Dirty desire?  
Dirty desire  
  
Dirty desire, dirty desire, dirty desire, dirty desire  
  
I know you thought about it  
But it's all in your head  
And you can't wait to see me  
To see me in the flesh  
I see you really need to  
Get this thing off your chest  
But all you know, I gotta get you back in my nest  
  
I try to let it go  
But that made me want you more  
'Cause in reality I know you're not mine  
I don't want just a fight, I want the full size  
Tell her I'll pay the fine  
  
Can you feel my  
Dirty desire?  
My  
Dirty desire?  
My  
Dirty desire?  
  
Can you feel my  
Dirty desire?  
My  
Dirty desire?

Now what you doing, babe  
You're not my boyfriend  
Long as we know babe, I'm not your girlfriend  
Now what you doing, babe  
You're not my boyfriend  
Long as we know babe, I'm not your girlfriend  
  
Desire, desire, desire, desire, desire, desire, desire, desire  
  
Bring that beat back! [Repeat: x4]

I still remember the ways that you touched me  
Now I know I don't mean anything to you  
You're easy breezy, and I'm Japanese-why  
Soon you'll mean exactly nothin' to me  
And that means  
  
You look stupid  
Tellin' all your friends how you got the best of me  
I intended to share the pleasure  
Only I look stupid  
We're livin' in a world with a lot of pressure  
It's quite un-needed to put more pressure on me  
  
You came and went and left my house like "I was just passin' by"  
Hello, goodbye, you left a note saying t'was nice stoppin' by  
I should have never ever let you inside  
  
[Chorus]  
I still remember the ways that you touched me  
Now I know I don't mean anything to you  
You're easy breezy, and I'm Japanese-why  
Soon you'll mean exactly nothin' to me  
Does that mean anything to you?  
  
Easy breezy  
Do you whistle so high that you're feelin' lonely?  
How do I breathe?  
With all this pressure on me?  
Easy breezy  
When you wrestle you know that you hurt somebody  
How do I breathe?  
With all this pressure on me?  
  
You came and went and left my house like "I was just passin' by"  
Konnichiwa, sayanora  
T'was nice of you to stop by  
Would it amuse you if I told you that I  
  
I still remember the ways that you touched me  
Now I know I don't mean anything to you  
You're easy breezy, and I'm Japanese-why  
Soon you'll mean exactly nothin' to me  
Does that mean anything to you?  
  
You're easy breezy, and I'm Japanese-why  
Soon you'll mean exactly nothin' to me  
Does that mean anything to you?  
  
You're easy breezy, and I'm Japanese-why  
Soon you'll mean exactly nothin' to me  
Does that mean anything to you?  
You're easy breezy, and I'm Japanese-why  
  
She's got a new microphone  
She's got a new microphone  
You're easy breezy, and I'm Japanese-why  
She's got a new microphone  
Doesn't need you anymore.  
She doesn't need you anymore

With you these streets are heaven  
Now home feel so foreign  
They told me I was mistaken, infatuated  
And I was afraid to trust my hunches  
Now I am ready  
  
Daddy don't be mad that I'm leaving  
Please let me worry about me  
Mama don't you worry about me  
This is my story  
  
Through mountains high and valleys low  
The ocean, through the desert, snow  
We'll say goodbye to the friends we know  
This is our Exodus '04  
  
Through traffic jams in Tokyo  
New music on the radio  
We'll say goodbye to the world we know  
This is our Exodus '04  
  
Landscapes keep changing  
History teaches something  
I know I could be mistaken, but my heart has spoken  
I cannot redirect my feelings  
The waves have parted  
  
Daddy don't be mad that I'm leaving  
Please let me worry about me  
Mama don't you worry about me  
This is my story  
  
Through mountains high and valleys low  
The ocean, through the desert, snow  
We'll say goodbye to the friends we know  
This is our Exodus '04  
  
Through traffic jams in Tokyo  
New music on the radio  
We'll say goodbye to the world we know  
This is our Exodus '04  
  
I'm listening to a music never ending  
My baby don't you know I'll never let you down  
You've opened me to so many different endings  
But baby I know that you'll always be around  
  
Through mountains high and valleys low  
The ocean, through the desert, snow  
We'll say goodbye to the friends we know  
This is our Exodus '04  
  
Through traffic jams in Tokyo  
New music on the radio  
We'll say goodbye to the world we know  
This is our Exodus '04

Poets often use many words  
To say a simple thing  
It takes thought and time and rhyme  
To make a poem singing  
With music and words I've been flying  
For you I have written a song  
To be sure that you'll know what I'm saying  
I'll translate as I go along  
Fly me to the moon,  
And let me play among the stars  
Won't you let me see what spring is like on Jupiter and Mars  
In other words: Hold my hand!  
In other words: Darling, kiss me!  
Fill my heart with song,  
And let me sing forever more  
You are all I long for all I worship and adore  
In other words: Please be true!  
In other words: I love you!  
In other words: Please be true!  
In other words: I love you!  
Com'on, just take me to the moon... yeah  

When I put my headphones on and hide amongst the crowds  
I feel like I must've just disappeared.  
that music that makes even the sound of my own footsteps fade away.  
Until I forget you and our fighting I want to dance.  
When I come back to a messy room,  
I can see my own loneliness through your existence.  
Though it would be better to become kinder for my sake and not someone else's,  
I can't feel lonely all by myself, that's why  
For you I want to give you the same loneliness so that you can become strong  
So that someday it can reach you, that's why  
I sing this song for you.  
Even on mornings when I don't want to get up,  
I get up to see your face.  
On sleepless nights,  
I sing to myself the song you gave me.  
Don't get me wrong,  
I don't intend to ever rely on you for anything at all.  
If there's a song I can sing for only me and not anyone else,  
I don't wanna remember that kind of song.  
That's why for you if you misunderstand me, I feel this heartbreak  
Eventhough I should be used to it, eventhough I should be milder.  
That's why I sing this song for you  
I want to make you cry  
Let me hurt you, and let me heal you  
When I want to fly you always give me a brighter sky.  
You want to make me cry  
You taught me joy by sorrow  
When I want to shine you always give me a darker sky.

English translation:  
Though I've lived  
All this time  
All by myself  
Unconcerned with destiny  
I was awoken by  
A flash of light,  
In the middle of the night  
I quietly stand at the exit  
Shooting light at the darkness  
Nowadays I wonder if making promises  
Will only make things worse.  
I just want to tell someone my wish.  
I'll introduce you to my family  
I'm sure you'll go over well.  
No matter what happens  
We're always together  
No matter what happens  
We're by each other's side  
A light named you finds me  
In the middle of the night.  
Go out into a noisy street (When you turn my way)  
Take off the mask of destiny. (Take it all away)  
Stop doing meaningless things  
Like always trying to predict what's gonna happen next.  
Let's eat tasty food today.  
The future is still way off.  
Even I don't know what will happen  
Don't complete it  
Make it better,  
We'll be okay if we take it  
One scene at a time.  
A light named you reflects my scenario,  
On the screen.  
Let's talk some more,  
About the tomorrow which is just around the bend.  
Turn off the TV  
An look only at me.  
No matter how good it seems  
I can't truly believe  
At those times  
We're with each other.  
A light called you finds me  
In the middle of the night.  
Let's talk some more,  
About the tomorrow which is just around the bend.  
Turn off the TV  
And look only at me.  
Let's talk some more,  
About the tomorrow which is just around the bend.  
Turn off the tV  
And look only at me.  

She rises with the sunset  
She wonders, "When will this end?"  
The world is full of money, full of money  
  
She goes out unprotected  
She doesn't listen to her best friend  
It's only for the money, for the money, for the money  
  
She doesn't want to be respected  
Reality's her best friend  
She needs the extra money, extra money  
  
In the city, the town, and the household  
So many things go unreported  
So many things her eyes have seen, eyes have seen, eyes have seen  
  
Meet me in the hotel lobby  
Everybody's looking lonely  
Watch me as I walk in slowly  
When your eyes meet mine  
It's in the mirrors of the hotel lobby  
  
This is not what she expected  
Her hopes, they stretch and they bend  
Wrinkle like paper money, paper money  
  
In the city, the town, and the household  
So many things can be distorted  
So if you want a true life story, bring money, bring money  
  
Meet me in the hotel lobby  
Everybody's looking lonely  
Watch me as I walk in slowly  
When your eyes meet mine  
It's in the mirrors of the hotel lobby  
  
Meet me in the hotel lobby  
Everybody's looking lonely  
Watch me as I walk in slowly  
When your eyes meet mine  
It's in the mirrors of the hotel lobby  
  
She's unprotected  
She's unprotected, oh  
She's unprotected  
She's unprotected, oh  
  
Meet me in the hotel lobby  
Everybody's looking lonely  
Watch me as I walk in slowly  
When your eyes meet mine  
It's in the mirrors of the hotel lobby  
  
Meet me in the hotel lobby  
Everybody's looking lonely  
Catch me because I think I'm falling  
I'll be waiting in the mirrors of the hotel lobby

On a Tuesday morning we pass in the hallway  
But you don't notice  
I'm sure you don't even know my name  
But I don't care about that  
  
With fake nails, color contacts  
Extensions decorating my hair and wearing fake fur  
Why am I looking for true love?  
Fighting is okay, but I'm tired of that  
  
If I close my eyes, dreams and reality are the same  
That's why I'm dreaming of you  
In my room, I escape into a dream  
If I close my mouth, lies and truth are the same  
  
It's a line that moves my soul, but I can't hear anything  
From far away someone is calling me  
But I don't yet want to return  
The noise of the city is comfortable  
  
Cold, kind, I'm enfolded in my own private zone  
Why am I always searching for a place to be?  
I laugh, I cry, I don't mind if I hurt people  
If I close my eyes, dreams and reality are the same  
  
That's why I'm always with you  
In my room, I escape into a dream  
If you're with me, lies and truth are the same  
There are days when I want to run away  
And forget everything  
  
If I close my eyes, dreams and reality are the same  
That's why I'm dreaming of you  
In my room, I escape into a dream  
If you're with me, lies and truth are the same

All along I was searching for my Lenore  
In the words of Mr. Edgar Allan Poe  
Now I'm sober and "Nevermore"  
Will the Raven come to bother me at home  
  
Calling you, calling you home  
You, calling you, calling you home  
  
By the door you said you had to go  
Couldn't help me anymore  
This I saw coming, long before  
So I kept on staring out the window  
  
Calling you, calling you home  
You, calling you, calling you home  
  
I am a natural entertainer, aren't we all  
Holding pieces of dying ember  
I'm just trying to remember who I can call  
Who can I call  
  
Home, calling you, calling you  
  
I run a secret propaganda  
Aren't we all hiding pieces of broken anger  
I'm just trying to remember who I can call  
Can I call  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
Born in a war of opposite attraction  
It isn't, or is it a natural conception  
Torn by the arms in the opposite directions  
It isn't, or is it a Modernist reaction  
  
Is it like this  
Is it always the same  
When a heartache begins, is it like this  
  
Do you like this  
Is it always the same  
Will you come back again  
  
Do you like this  
Is it always the same  
Will you come back again  
Do you like this  
  
Do you like this  
Is it like this  
Is it always the same  
If you change your phone number, will you tell me  
  
Is it like this  
Is it always the same  
When a heartache begins, is it like this  
  
If you like this  
Will you remember my name  
Will you play it again, if you like this

What a day, young boy next door passed away  
Oh it makes me want to say  
I don't want to waste another day  
  
Can you and I start mixing gene pools  
Eastern, Western people  
Get naughty multilingual  
  
I was sort of like soul searching  
But your body's so jaw-dropping  
Our chemistry's groundbreaking  
Don't keep me waiting  
  
Hurry up, baby hurry up, baby  
Let me give you my love  
Hurry up, let's turn this room into a melting pot  
Giddy up, baby giddy up, baby  
Let me give you my love  
Buckle up, boy I know you're gonna like what I got  
  
Maybe it's not worth the wait  
Maybe I should walk away  
I don't want to waste my energy  
  
Can you and I stop acting like fools  
Or move on to other people  
It's funny, but I'd like to settle  
  
I was sort of like soul searching  
But your body's so jaw-dropping  
Some say it's rule breaking  
But times are changing  
  
Hurry up, baby hurry up, baby  
Let me give you my love  
Hurry up, let's turn this room into a melting pot  
Giddy up, baby giddy up, baby  
Let me give you my love  
Buckle up, boy I know you're gonna like what I got  
  
Let me know if what I'm feeling isn't mutual  
All I know is that I'm feeling very very hot hot hot  
  
Hurry up, baby hurry up, baby  
Let me give you my love  
Hurry up, let's turn this room into a melting pot  
Giddy up, baby giddy up, baby  
Let me give you my love  
Buckle up, boy I know you're gonna like what I got  
  
Hurry up, baby hurry up, baby  
Let me give you my love  
Hurry up, let's turn this room into a melting pot  
Giddy up, baby giddy up, baby  
Let me give you my love  
Buckle up, boy I know you're gonna like what I got

Tell me that you'll never ever leave me  
Then you go ahead and leave me  
What the hell is going on  
Tell me that you really really love me  
Then you go ahead and leave me  
How the hell do I go on...  

Everyday in my life's in shambles  
It's easy, took the love away  
I got nothing left to gamble  
I've thrown it all away  
  
[Chorus:]  
Now and then I'm suicidal  
Flirting with a new temptation  
Happiness inside a bottle is what I need today  
Oh my lover's gone away, gone to Istanbul  
Light as a feather  
I lie in my bed and flip through TV channels  
Eating Godiva  
I'm smoking my days away reading old emails  
In my old pajamas  
What a day, me muero, muero, muero  
  
Loneliness makes it's arrival  
Depression starts to settle in  
Try to go where no one'll write her  
And do some crazy thing  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's the good stuff, oh my lover  
Lover  
Smoking, I'm smoking my days away  
What a day, me muero, muero, muero  
What a day  
  
Gone away... yeah  
Doctor, doctor  
You give me my lover  
Oh yeah  
Oh my lover  
Gone, gone away  
My lover, gone away  
What a day, me muero, muero, muero

Nothing's gonna stop me  
Only you can stop me  
Nothing's gonna stop me  
Only you can stop me  
  
It's the middle of the night, 3 am, I'm waiting  
For the cell phone by my bed to ring, I'm acting like a fool  
The alarm on my clock rings, just like a fairy tale  
Even if I find the glass slipper, it'll be no good  
If it's too much trouble for you to care, then let me know soon  
Even I don't have that much time  
I'm movin' on without you  
  
I can't pretend anymore  
That I don't know about your stupid alibis  
We didn't always have these kind of memories  
It shouldn't have been painful  
Why?  
Maybe it was to soon to play a good girl  
  
Nothing's gonna stop me  
Only you can stop me  
  
The lines I planned to say were perfect  
But I still can't get through, it's 4 am  
When the night's too quiet, my thoughts get restless  
I understand, but I still can't get enough sleep  
I've forgotten that promise  
I'll give you back your ring, so give me back my heart  
I have to go on without you  
  
It's hard, so I'll be the one to break up  
It's not good playing a good girl  
It shouldn't have been painful  
Why?  
Maybe it was to soon to play a good girl  
  
Nothing's gonna stop me  
Only you can stop me  
  
Even if it's confusing, I want to be loved  
Without saying it, I want you to understand  
It shouldn't have been painful  
Why?  
Maybe it was to soon to play a good girl  
  
Nothing's gonna stop me  
Only you can stop me

I just wanna dance the night the night away  
Go ahead and make my day Mister DJ  
  
Honeys if you're gay  
Burn it up like a gay parade  
Honeys if you're straight  
Pump it up, take it all the way  
Intoxicated, emancipated, unapologetic  
Is what I am today  
Light me up  
  
Make the night go on and on and on  
You know we go on and on and on  
Make the night go on and on and on  
I'm living up my life until the day I die  
Don't need a lullaby  
  
Music got me sweating hard I feel my heart  
Thumping like an 808 uh huh OK  
If you wanna mess with us  
Sink you with a counter-punch  
  
Honeys if you're gay  
Burn it up like a gay parade  
Honeys if you're straight  
Pump it up, take it all the way  
Intoxicated, emancipated, unapologetic  
Is what I am today  
Light me up  
  
Make the night go on and on and on  
You know we go on and on and on  
Make the night go on and on and on  
I'm living up my life until the day I die  
Don't need a lullaby

Late night broadcast  
The TV looks at me with its blue eyes  
No matter how often I change the channel  
I can't escape that gaze  
No matter how many times I look in the fridge  
It's the same answer, an answer I'm used to hearing  
The timelimit is about up  
I need more time, let me be  
Oh no, this is a parody  
But to me, it's my life story  
Without waiting for me, the clock  
Pretends not to know anything  
I know, it's a common story  
But to me, it's my life story  
Not being some copy of someone else  
I'll write the rest of it from now  
Facing the same way with everyone else  
It's the freeway  
It's just a coincidence  
When the road split, it was sudden  
Hurry me to the seventh floor, please  
The elevator is unusually small  
But no one else is here, so I feel safe  
Set me free from "thoughtfulness"  
Oh no, everything's a parody  
But to everyone, it's a true story  
Without putting any strength into it  
You pretend that you don't need anything  
I know a couple that looks just like us  
But they do nothing but argue  
Without putting much priority on it  
I'll read the rest of it from now  
Oh no, this is probably a parody  
I'm sure for someone, it's a fake story  
I can't wear any shoes but my own  
That's alright, since I can walk like that  
I know, it's a common story  
But to me, it's a real story  
Without waiting for the rest of it  
I'll go to see you from now  
  

Boy you make it hard, you make it hard to leave  
Boy you make it hard, you're no good for me  
  
Everyday, every night, you were out, with your boys  
Getting high  
While I worked hard to pay the rent  
And my girls said I should lose you but I stuck with you  
'Cause you promised to change  
  
What I gave, you took, nothing came in return  
But I, I kept on giving baby  
'Cause the sex was so good, and your talk was so smooth  
That I, I guess I bought it baby  
  
Now I finally see you were using me  
And I'm taking my money, my money, my money back  
Get down on your knees, begging me not to leave  
But I'm taking my money, my money, my money back  
  
I'm singing ooh ooh ooh, and ah ah ah  
You know I really loved you boy  
Ooh ooh ooh, and ah ah ah  
What a waste of a man so fine  
  
What about, out about all your fooling around  
While I, I had to cry about it  
Then you said you're sorry and you loved me only  
I should have left you right then  
  
Now I finally see you were using me  
And I'm taking my money, my money, my money back  
Get down on your knees, begging me not to leave  
But I'm taking my money, my money, my money back  
  
I'm singing ooh ooh ooh, and ah ah ah  
You know I really loved you boy  
Ooh ooh ooh, and ah ah ah  
What a waste of a man so fine  
  
Ooh ooh ooh, and ah ah ah  
Give me back my heart, give me back my time  
Ooh ooh ooh, and ah ah ah  
What a waste of a woman so fine  
  
Now I finally see you were using me  
And I'm taking my money, my money, my money back  
Get down on your knees, begging me not to leave  
But I'm taking my money, my money, my money back  
  
Ooh ooh ooh, and ah ah ah  
Give me back my heart, give me back my time  
Ooh ooh ooh, and ah ah ah  
What a waste of a woman so fine  
  
Ooh ooh ooh, and ah ah ah  
Give me back my heart, give me back my time  
Ooh ooh ooh, and ah ah ah  
What a waste of a woman so fine

I was dancing with a dirty blond Texan  
Charming accent but the music's playing too loud for talking  
So I showed him how people in the Far East get down  
  
Push it up, push it down  
Pull it up, pull it down  
Keep it up, keep it down  
Now put me down  
What a workout!  
  
If you want, you can come  
Come get it, get it  
If you don't you may really regret it, 'gret it  
Up and down till your knees start shakin' shakin'  
ain't it good to be alive tonight  
  
One life, two-time, three girls, four guys  
Five ripples running up and down my spine  
6.0 Make it sweet, drop another dime  
  
I was talking with a born-again Christian  
"So what's it like to start life all over?"  
He sad "Amen,  
I feel like I've been rediscovering the tomb of Tutankhamen."  
  
Push it up, push it down  
Pull it up, pull it down  
Baby, don't put me down  
What a workout!  
  
What you want, it's a done deal  
Shake it, shake it  
What you don't, you can forget about it, 'bout it  
Up and down, feel your brainwaves jumpin' jumpin'  
Makes me want to take a dive  
  
As we count to five  
  
One life, two-time, three girls, four guys  
Five ripples running up and down my spine  
  
Can you hold on, someone's calling on the other line  
  
Push it up, push it down  
Pull it up, pull it down  
Keep it up, keep it down  
Now put me down  
What a workout!  
  
If you want, you can come  
Come get it, get it  
If you don't you may really regret it, 'gret it  
Up and down till your knees start shakin' shakin'  
Ain't it good to be alive tonight  
  
One life, two-time, three girls, four guys  
Five ripples running up and down my spine  
6.0 Make it sweet, drop another dime

Every time I think about you  
Heaven knows I fall into a groove  
You're like a great interlude  
Every time I think about your body my body says ooh ooh  
Every time I think about you heaven needs a prayer  
'Cause you're married and you've even got a family too  
Pray that they don't hear you  
Now let me see you dance on your tippy toe (ooh)  
  
What a perfect life they think you've got, right?  
Problems kept inside, look neat and organized  
What you need in life is some wonder  
A new friend with visions like you  
  
Nobody has to know (Synchronize it)  
Stay very close to the floor  
Nobody has to know (Synchronize it)  
Careful when you close the door  
Nobody has to know (Synchronize it)  
When we tippy toe, tippy toe (Just imagine)  
My body under your body  
Here we go everybody, 3, 2, 1  
  
Every time I think about you  
Heaven knows I fall into a groove  
You're like a great interlude  
Every time I think about your body my body says ooh ooh  
Every time I think about you heaven needs a prayer  
'Cause you're married and you've even got a family too  
Pray that they don't hear you  
Now let me see you dance on your tippy toe (ooh)  
  
When the thrill subsides, will you still be mine?  
Worry infiltrates my head till I kill it  
I fill it instead with improper visions of you  
  
Nobody has to know (Synchronize it)  
Stay very close to the floor  
Nobody has to know (Synchronize it)  
Careful when you close the door  
Nobody has to know (Synchronize it)  
When we tippy toe, tippy toe  
Nobody has to know, body screaming MORE  
On your mark set 3, 2, 1  
  
Every time I think about you  
Heaven knows I fall into a groove  
You're like a great interlude  
Every time I think about your body my body says ooh ooh  
Every time I think about you heaven needs a prayer  
'Cause you're married and you've even got a family too  
Pray that they don't hear you  
Now let me see you dance on your tippy toe (ooh)  
  
Every time I think about you  
Heaven knows I fall into a groove  
You're like a great interlude  
Every time I think about your body my body says ooh ooh  
Every time I think about you heaven needs a prayer  
'Cause you're married and you've even got a family too  
Pray that they don't hear you  
Now let me see you dance on your tippy toe (ooh)

Uh, Uh, Come on, yea!  
Huh, Ohh, Mmm Mmmm  
Wha'ch doin' tonight, Let's go for a ride!  
Ta ta are you, Ta ta are you, Ta ta are you, Ta ta are you, Ta ta are you, Ta
ta are you, Ta ta are you  
Oooh Woa!  
Ta ta are you, Ta ta are you, Ta ta are you, Ta ta are you, Ta ta are you, Ta
ta are you, Ta ta are you  
  
I'm a workaholic even on  
Friday afternoons  
Snatchin' up a taxi is easy, (and I jump right in)?  
I've got my eye on you  
  
The taxi driver looks to me and says "Where to?"  
Oh, just kinda over there  
?The bad economy's a problem (closing)  
Please watch out for the door?  
  
Riding on the wind, Climbing up to the moon  
My place is here? right next to you  
The problem is it's hard to go home  
Admist the dreamy spring night  
  
Traveling, with you  
Traveling, onward  
Lighting up the asphalt (?In the asphalt, blazing up a trail?)  
Traveling, where  
Traveling, are you going?  
To anywhere far  
  
Traveling, beyond  
Traveling, get down (?shake it?)  
Let the light shine away all your troubles  
Traveling, let's fly now  
Traveling, speed up  
Even though we're not in a hurry  
  
Ta ta are you, Ta ta are you, Ta ta are you, Ta ta are you, Ta ta are you, Ta
ta are you, Ta ta are you  
Oooh Woa!  
Ta ta are you, Ta ta are you, Ta ta are you, Ta ta are you, Ta ta are you, Ta
ta are you, Ta ta are you  
  
There's a song and I want to sing it  
Over and over again  
So I can spur my feelings on until they won't stop  
That's the plan  
  
Partying with the waves, Thanking the clouds  
I finally met you  
Because we're young  
Nothing more than dust blowing in the wind  
  
Traveling, our hearts  
Traveling, press closer  
Now and forever let's abandon the usual  
Traveling, this place is  
Traveling, shabby  
Our destination is not here.  
  
Traveling, Your window  
Traveling, open it  
There's nothing to fear  
Traveling, here  
Traveling, all is well  
Everything we've got is in our hearts  
  
This is the time to dance and have fun  
Don't hold it back tonight  
The hidden wishes in your heart are gonna hurt you  
Put up your hands and have some fun!  
And why does  
Some wariness remain  
  
Traveling, with you  
Traveling, still  
In the asphalt, blazing a trail  
Traveling, where  
Traveling, are you?  
The good times are about to begin  
  
Traveling, let's fly now  
Traveling, shake it  
Let the light shine away all your troubles  
Traveling, let's fly now  
Traveling, speed up  
I don't want to stop  
  
Can you take me up?  
You look quite good.  
Can you keep it up?  
I would like to.  
Can you take me up?  
You look quite good.  
Can you keep it up?  
Ohhao oa oooh ohh whoa oh ohhoa (Traaaaaveling)  
Oh woa ohoa oha ohhh (Ohhhhhhh Traaaaveling)??  
Don't stop now, Don't stop now, Don't stop now, oooh whoa?
