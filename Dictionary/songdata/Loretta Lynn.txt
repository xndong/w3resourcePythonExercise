He showed me there was more to me  
When I thought I had nothing else to give  
God knows he wasn't perfect  
Ah, but then, again, nobody is  
He always told me the truth  
No matter how hard it was to hear  
When he said, "I believe in you"  
It was music to my ears  
Oh, each word's like a note, like a beautiful tune  
The kind that inspires and helps me get through  
Ah, if I said I can't, he's say, "You can"  
He was my toughest critic, ah, my biggest fan  
Now he's gone to a distant shore  
And I can't hear the music anymore  
Sometimes late at night  
I forget that he's not lyin' next to me  
He may be out of sight  
But out of mine is something he won't ever be  
Things that he said to me  
Are still ringing out loud and clear  
When he said, "I love you, baby"  
That was music to my ears  
Oh, each word's like a note, like a beautiful tune  
The kind that inspires and helps me get through  
Ah, if I said I can't, he's say, "You can"  
He was my toughest critic, ah, my biggest fan  
Now he's gone to a distant shore  
And I can't hear the music anymore  
I can't hear the music  

You know that I love you my love made me your fool  
The way down deep inside I know you never will be true  
But I'll keep holdin' on for life just as long as I can  
I'm one man's woman but you're any woman's man  
I'm one man's woman but you're any woman's man  
But I can't let that change me into something I can't stand  
I give you all the love I have but your love is out of hand  
I'm one man's woman but you're any woman's man  
[ piano ]  
Sometimes I have a notion to get revenge but then  
Since I'm in love who cares about the place I've never been  
When temptation smiled at me back to your arms I ran  
I'm one man's woman but you're any woman's man  
I'm one man's woman...  
  
  

I come to the garden alone while the dew is still on the roses  
And the voice I hear falling on my ear the son of God discloses  
And he walks with me and he talks with me and he tells me I am his own  
And the joy we share as we tarry there none other has ever known  
  
He speaks and the sound of his voice is so sweet that the birds hush their
singing  
And the melody that he gave to me within my heart is ringing  
And he walks with me

Indian Lake is a scene you should make with your little one  
Keep it in mind if you're lookin' to find a place in the summer sun  
Swim in the cove have a snack in the grove or you can rent a canoe  
At Indian Lake you'll be able to make the way like the Indians do  
  
You take a bus marked Lakewood Drive  
And you keep on ridin' till you're out of the city  
Where the air is fine with the sweet smellin' pines and the country side's
pretty  
And you'll see daffodils peepin' over the hills or a honey lovin' mama bear  
Just take a left at the bridge go down to Quaker town Ridge  
And in a minute you're there  
Indian Lake is a scene you should make  
  
Indian Lake is a scene you should make  
And you'll see daffodils peepin' over the hills  
Indian Lake is a scene you should make

Is it wrong for loving you is it wrong for being true  
Tell me darling tell me please is it wrong  
Have I waited for so long has your love for me gone  
Is it wrong is it wrong for loving you  
  
Way down deep inside my heart you're the only love sweetheart  
Yes the only true love I ever knew  
But I ask myself inside no need telling myself lies  
Is it wrong is it wrong for loving you  
[ piano - steel ]  
Is it wrong for loving you..

It's another world when I'm with you  
Roses everywhere blue skies up above everybody is in love  
It's another world when I'm with you and that's where I wanna be  
Never a day goes by when I'm blue there's no tears in my eyes when I'm with
you  
It's another world when I'm with you  
Nights are made for love days are never long nothing nothing can go wrong  
It's another world when I'm with you and that's where I wanna be  
[ steel ]  
Never a day goes by when I'm blue there's no tears in my eyes when I'm with
you  
It's another world when I'm with you  
And it's here right now let me hold you close love you know just grows and
grows  
It's another world when I'm with you and that's where I wanna be  
  
  

Let me go please let me go you're hurtin' me  
I've lost all your love so I can't understand  
Are you holding on to just show me you can  
This grip you'll have on me is as tight as it can be  
Let me go please let me go you're hurtin' me  
Staying here unwanted will be the death of me  
Needing love that you won't give me so desperately  
It's more than I can stand let me go for I still can't  
Let me go please let me go you're hurtin' me  
Got no place to go but I'll go anyway  
If I go I'll cry and I'll cry if I stay  
I still love you can't you see and I don't want to be free  
Let me go please let me go you're hurtin' me  
Staying here unwanted will be the death of me...  
  
  

There's a reason for the sunshine sky there's a reason why I'm feeling so high  
Must be the season when that love light shines all around us  
So let that feeling grab you deep inside and send you reeling  
Where your love can't hide and then go stealing  
  
Through the moonless nights with your lover  
Just let your love flow like a mountain stream  
Let your love grow with the smallest of dreams  
And let your love show and you'll know what I mean it's the season  
  
Yeah let your love fly like a bird on the wing  
And let your love bind you to all living things  
And let your love shine and you'll know what I mean that's the reason  
  
There's a reason for the warm sweet nights and there's a reason for the candle
lights  
Must be the season when those love rites shine all around us  
So let the wonder take you into space and lay you under its loving embrace  
Let feel the thunder as it warms your face you can't hold back  
  
Just let your love flow...  
Just let your love flow...

Many heartaches have passed since we met  
There's a kind that a heart can't forget  
And the sweet memories are too few  
While I'm living my lifetime for you  
I'm living my life for you  
You're living to break me in two  
I'd die while you're being untrue  
Still I'm living my lifetime for you  
[ guitar ]  
If ever there should come a time  
When you feel that you'd like to die  
Well you've made me feel that way too  
But I'm living my lifetime for you  
I'm living my life for you...  
  
  

Had our number changed today although I hated to  
But each time the phone would ring they'd want to speak to you  
And it hurts to tell them you're not here with me  
Maybe now oh telephone will let me be  
It's not in the book now so you'd better write it down  
Just in case your love for me should ever come around  
You might want to call and break the news to me  
Just dial Lonesome 7-7203  
  
I keep the telephone beside me all the time  
Hoping you might want to call and say you've changed your mind  
If you do then darling you know where I'll be  
I'm at Lonesome 7-7203  
You're the only one I'm givin' our new number to  
So now if the telephone should ring I'll know it's you  
If you ever long for love that used to be  
Just call Lonesome 7-7203

So long we've been married last burden we've carried  
Though fate kept us humble and made our love true  
But plans that we'd make up someone seems to break up  
Oh darling what else can we do  
We may have to leave here to find piece of mind dear  
Some place where we can live a life all our own  
I know you love me and happy we could be  
If some folks would leave us alone  
  
They say you are leavin' that you are deceivin'  
But you tell me they say the same about me  
But we'll show them there on that loose talk and do harm  
And hope that's the truth they will see  
We may have to leave here  
  
When I go out walkin' there's lots of loose talkin'  
They say we're unhappy and we'll break apart  
But darling that's not true because I still love you  
And I do with all of my heart  
We may have to leave here

Hey Louisiana woman, Mississippi man  
We get together every time we can  
The Mississippi River can keep us apart  
There's too much love in this Mississippi heart  
Too much love in this Louisiana heart  
  
See the alligators all a waitin' nearby  
Soon or later they know I'm gonna try  
When she wave from the bank don't you know I know  
It's goodbye fishin' line see you while ago  
With a Louisiana woman waitin' on the other side  
The Mississippi River don't look so wide  
  
Louisiana woman, Mississippi man  
We get together every time we can  
The Mississippi River can keep us apart  
There's too much love in this Mississippi heart  
Too much love in this Louisiana heart  
  
Well I thought I'd been loved but I never had  
Till I was wrapped in the arms of a Mississippi man  
When he holds me close it feels almost  
Like another hurricane just ripped the coast  
If he can't come to me, I'm gonna go to him  
That Mississippi River Lord, I'm gonna swim  
  
Hey Louisiana woman, Mississippi man  
We get together every time we can  
The Mississippi River can keep us apart  
There's too much love in this Mississippi heart  
Too much love in this Louisiana heart  
  
Well Mississippi River Lord it's one mile wide  
And I'm gonna get me to the other side  
Mississippi man, I'm losin' my mind  
Gotta have your loving one more time  
I'm gonna jump in the river and here go  
Too bad alligator you swim too slow  
  
Hey Louisiana woman, Mississippi man  
We get together every time we can  
The Mississippi River can keep us apart  
There's too much love in this Mississippi heart  
Too much love in this Louisiana heart  
  
There's too much love in this Mississippi heart  
Too much love in this Louisiana heart  
There's too much love in this Mississippi heart  
Too much love in this Louisiana heart  
There's too much love in this Mississippi heart  
Too much love in this Louisiana heart

I've seen him as he awakens in the morning  
He reaches out his hand and without a word  
As his fingers softly fall upon my face  
He lights the flame of desire and makes me want him.  
  
Chorus:  
Love is the foundation we lean on and all you need is love to ease your mind.  
It doesn't have to be right to be called love  
When he gives me more lovin' that a lifetime of looking could ever find.  
(repeat)

I beg you pardon I never promised you a rose garden  
Along with the sunshine there's gotta be a little rain sometimes  
When you take you gotta give so live and let live or let go  
I beg you pardon I never promised you a rose garden  
I could promise you things like big diamond rings  
But you don't find roses growing on stalks of clover so you'd better think it
over  
When it's sweet talking you could make it come true  
I would give you the world right now on a silver platter but what would it
matter  
So smile for a while and let's be jolly love shouldn't be so melancholy  
Come along and share the good times while we can  
I beg you pardon I never promised you a rose garden  
  
I could sing you a tune and promise you the moon  
But if that's what it takes to hold you I'd just as soon let you go  
But there's one thing I want you to know  
You better look before you leap still water runs deep  
And there won't always be someone there to pull you out  
And you know what I'm talking about  
So smile for a while and let's be jolly  
I beg you pardon I never promised you a rose garden

Sometimes true love has to choose to do what it don't want to do  
And sometimes patience has to give up a hanging on  
Darling I'll be far away and you'll be wishing I had stayed  
After Ruby Madge And Mable send you home  
After Ruby settled down and Madge moved back to her hometown  
After Mable says you're fool leave me alone  
You'll find out how much it hurts and just how much a dream is worth  
After Ruby Madge And Mable send you home  
[ piano ]  
You'll find out what lonely mean but you won't find the broken chain  
That once bound our love together proud and strong  
You start talking to the walls and count every tear that falls  
After Ruby Madge And Mable send you home  
After Ruby settled down...

You put a halo and wings around me now you say that I have gone bad  
But while you were busy with business and booze  
I lost the wings and the halo I had  
You say I went from a saint to a sinner but you can't blame me for it all  
You were the teacher I was just a beginner you don't know how it hurt me to
fall  
[ piano - steel ]  
You didn't think that your angel could wander but I'm just like you flesh and
blood  
While you had your drinkin' your buddies and business  
I guess I had too much time all alone  
You say I went...

Satin sheets to lie on satin pillows to cry on  
But still I'm not happy don't you see  
Big long Cadillacs pretty clothes upon my back  
But still I want you to set you free  
I found another man who can give me more than you can  
So you've given everything that money can buy  
But your money can't hold me tight like he does on a long long night  
No you didn't keep me satisfied  
Satin sheets to lie on...  
Oh but still I want you to set you free

Once I had a secret love that lived within the heart of me  
All too soon my secret love became impatient to be free  
So I told a friendly star the way that dreamers often do  
Just how wonderful you are and why I'm so in love with you  
Now I shout it from the highest hills even told the golden daffodils  
And now my heart's an open door and my secret love's no secret anymore  
Now I shout it from the highest hills

See that mountain I'm gonna have to climb  
Well there's a river waitin' on the other side  
And the road leading nowhere I'll take it for I must  
He's somewhere tomorrow or I'll bust  
You can go along with me and be my friend  
Or you can stay and wish you'd gone alone  
And you can follow me in postcard that I'll send  
But by the time you enter I'll be gone  
Life is a circle spinning round  
Searching for what you haven't found  
I leave today to look for my tomorrow  
Tomorrow I'll come searching for today  
[ ac.guitar ]  
See that mountain I'm gonna have to climb...  
I don't know that I'd be coming back this way  
But if you stay and I'd come back someday  
Then I'll teach you the lessons that I've learned  
And I'll build back the bridges that I've burned  
Life is a circle spinning round...  
Yeah tomorrow I'll come searching for today  
  
  

Silver bells silver bells it's Christmas time in the city  
Ring a ling hear them ring soon it will be Christmas Day  
City sidewalks busy sidewalks dressed in holiday style  
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas  
  
Children laughing people passing meeting smile after smile  
And on every street corner you hear  
Silver bells silver bells...  
  
(Silver bells) silver bells (silver bells)  
Silver bells soon it will be Christmas Day

I don't want your lonely mansion with a tear in every room  
All I want is the love you promised beneath the hallow moon  
But you think I should be happy with your money and your name  
And hide myself in sorrow while you play your cheating game  
  
Silver threads and golden needles cannot mend this heart of mine  
And I dare never drown my sorrows in the warm glow of your wine  
You can't buy my love with money for I never was that kind  
Silver threads and golden needles cannot mend this heart of mine  
  
Silver threads and golden needles cannot mend this heart of mine  
And I dare never drown my sorrows in the warm glow of your wine  
You can't buy my love with money for I never was that kind  
Silver threads and golden needles cannot mend this heart of mine  
  
Silver threads and golden needles cannot mend this heart of mine  
And I dare never drown my sorrows in the warm glow of your wine  
You can't buy my love with money for I never was that kind  
Silver threads and golden needles cannot mend this heart of mine

Oh I can't live without you and I'm barely living with you  
I can't get her off your mind and I can't set you free  
When you look at one another your look tells me you love her  
And that's the part that slowly killing me  
Oh what's this other woman done to you  
She can't ever love you like I do  
Cry tears enough to drown me heartache's closing in around me  
And that's the part that slowly killing me  
[ steel ]  
Oh what's this other woman done to you  
Why she can't ever love you like I do  
I'd die the night you leave me I cry but you don't see me  
And that's the part that slowly killing me  
Yes that's the part that slowly killing me  
  
  

Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling calling for you and for me  
See on the portal he's waiting and watching watching for you and for me  
Come home come home ye who are weary come home  
Earnestly tenderly Jesus is calling calling oh sinner come home  
  
Why should we tarry when Jesus is pleading pleading for you and for me  
Why should we linger and heed not his mercies mercies for you and for me  
Come home come home
