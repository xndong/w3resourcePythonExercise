All dressed up, all dressed up  
You don't even comfort me  
And carry on with the will of samson  
You don't even comfort me  
You keep your faith and you keep your phantoms  
And you don't even care  
No you don't even care  
All dressed up still there's something wrong  
I'm all dressed up and you're just a song

Are we gonna figure out or make it round our little circular trend  
Are we gonna break it down or hang around or make it good in the end  
You make me smile when I don't feel like dealing  
You're suicidal and you're fresh out of feeling  
You say I love you like a slap on the wrist  
Do I deserve this  
Are we gonna build it up or blow it out our little fire of sin  
Are you gonna fuck it up or hear me out or honey will you give in  
Yeah

You want my child but you don't have the passion

You got a mistress  
A new bitch to get you high  
Fi-fi-fi-fi-fi-find it  
Or you're gonna freak out  
You're fucking out of your mind  
Can't you see the damage done  
Is all over now  
You can't cry anymore girl  
Cause your tears dried up  
With the needle and the score yeah  
Lie-lie-lie-lie-lie-lie-like it or not  
You can't stop  
Such a heavenly ride  
Memorize the number  
Got a beep-beep-beeper  
The bump on Riverside  
Check my best friend out  
She's burned out  
But she's beautiful inside  
Can't you see the damage done  
Is all over now  
You can't cry anymore girl  
Cause your tears dried up  
When you woke up on the floor  
Can't you see the damage done  
It's all over now  
You don't try anymore girl  
And I need you now

Disconnected, it's the way that I wanted it to be  
The Cult Electric is my favorite record of the week  
Cause I'm not feeling sweet  
  
But I can't say that when everyone is so judgmental  
And I can't play back all the times when you were gentle  
Cause even you can't be true  
  
It's astounding what love can do to a city  
Laurel Canyon was the best place for you and me to be  
I chose the curtains and I dreamed a dream of domesticity  
What a freak you made of me  
  
Now I'm on Zoloft because you told me I was crazy  
And I won't jump cause now I know you'd never catch me  
And I can't leave you because you swore you'd never let me  
But even you, talk shit too.  
  
It's January when I jumped the fence of your backyard  
Finish the fairy tale that you weren't drunk enough to start  
It's kind of scary when your lover leaves you for a movie star  
But I'm still in the dark  
  
But you have trained to watch my back and drop my standards  
And you have shamed me since the first time you were with her  
And you can't make me love your band or buy your records  
Cause you have tainted my respect for your adventures  
  
And you will never have the chance to trace my features  
And you will never make me feel like such a loser  
And you can have the past 'cause I'm in love with the future  
  
I'm in love with the future  
  
And I have met a boy  
Who makes you look so shallow (I'm in love with the future)  
And there is so much time  
And so much space to travel (I'm in love with the future)  
And I will make the climb and I will kiss the gravel (I'm in love with the  
Future)  
  
(Touch the sky) (It's kinda scary)  
And I will kiss the gravel (I'm in love with the future)  
  
(Touch the sky) (It's kinda scary)  
And I will kiss the gravel  
  
I'll touch the sky  
I'll touch the sky  
Watch me, watch me  
I'll touch the sky  
I'll touch  
The sky, the sky

I think I'm peeling  
  
And the ring in my ears  
  
From playing too loud  
  
I hear the ocean  
  
I hear the crowd  
  
Disconnected  
  
I am unattached  
  
Unmade bed makes me feel like a failure  
  
Bedroom eyes lead to blurry vision  
  
Blurry vision  
  
Oh...  
  
Oh...  
  
And the ring in my ears  
  
From playing too loud  
  
I hear the ocean  
  
I hear the crowd  
  
Too pale, too sick  
  
Too scrawny  
  
But I'll sleep here anyway  
  
And the sheets smell like bodies  
  
Not mine  
  
Not yours  
  
Not yours...  
  
It's 2 am  
  
And it's quiet again  
  
Where's my lip gloss?  
  
And the ring in my ears  
  
From playing too loud  
  
I hear the ocean  
  
I hear the crowd  
  
And the ring in my ears  
  
From playing too loud

Twice bitten, twice baked.  
Twice led down the same mistake.  
Try me on a Saturday, try me.  
Try me.  
Fine fool for a holiday.  
Slow sun in a Spanish way  
One heart for one week of May, why me?  
Why me?  
Twice given to yesterday  
Right for a foray with fate.  
Fly me home to heaven's gate, fly me.  
Fly me. Fly...

Twice led down the same mistake.  
Try me on a Saturday, try me.

Yellow baby, a yellow baby is a bad sign.  
But I don't mind, I don't mind.  
Ohhh, Forsythia.  
Spider monkey, a spider monkey is a good lie.  
But I don't know why.  
Ohhh, Forsythia, oh-ohhh.  
I don't mind sitting in the way, way back.  
I don't mind, lying to my friends.  
One thing about Forsythia,  
She comes around and I get lost  
Against her yellow, I'm no longer me.  
Yellow daisy, a dandelion or a pussy willow,  
It's a different thing.  
Oh-oh, Forsythia. Forsythia. Forsythia.

I'm spinning out.  
I can't control my car  
It doesn't matter,  
If you think you might be, you are.  
I misplace it. I don't know where it's at.  
And I could find it but I'd never get it back.  
Don't get it back [Repeat x2]  
The more you want it,  
The less you're gonna get back.  
I'm running out,  
I don't know when to stop.  
I thought I'd wait until  
I saw the penny drop.  
It started raining,  
Pennies falling in my lap.  
And I could spend it  
But I'd never get it back.  
Don't get it back. [Repeat x2]  
The more you want it

Weren't you the pilot  
Who fell from the skies?  
Was it a big mistake  
Or just plain homicide?  
How does it feel on the other side?  
Do you hang out with the  
Saints or the spies?  
  
Are you still hellraising?  
Are you still hellraising?  
Hellraising  
  
Is this the kind of thing we always fear?  
Are you so bent on hell you'd leave  
Me up here? (without you)

God help the suckers  
Dead in your path  
  
Are you still hellraising?

You will pay for your mistakes  
You will pay for your mistakes  
You will pay for your mistakes  
You will pay  
  
This love was born on crutches, crippled and bored  
Ripped out asleep and strangled by a phone cord  
Weren't you the pilot who swerved off the course  
Was it disaster or just plain divorce?

I wind you up  
Then I wait for the melancholy  
I give you up  
While you sit here in all your glory  
I never thought you would  
I never knew you could  
But now you're gone  
And I don't think I care  
I sold your love  
  
Down the river for a bow and arrow  
Euphoria has just been here  
And she's looking terrible  
I never sung this low  
It's better if you go  
I know you're mine  
I sit here and want you to try  
To love me like a monster  
One last time  
Control me like a father  
  
One last time, stay with  
Me till I'm stronger, one last  
Bound to kick me when I'm down  
Don't kick me when I'm down  
I never thought you would  
I never understood  
And that's why I'm weak and I want  
You to try to make me an  
Example one last time  
  
To drag me through the cycle  
One last time to make  
Me a disciple, one last  
Round, will get me to the ground  
You'll get me on the ground, oh yeah  
I'll see you around  
Yeah, I'll see you around  
One last time  
And I'll see you around  
Yeah, I'll see you around

I would rather die than take your bullet  
I would rather die than take your bullet  
I would rather die than take your bullet  
  
Only you know  
Only you know  
Only you know  
Only you know  
  
Only you know  
Only you know  
Only you know  
Only you know

Salt lakes I saved for myself  
I never thought you'd leave  
Countries I've claimed to myself  
I know you'll never be yourself again  
But what you were is still in question  
Pacific ocean's way too small  
For both of us to swim  
Antarctica will have to thaw  
For us to meet again  
And I respect the all of what is fair and worthy  
And I will never feel this way about another person  
And I will never feel this way again  
I want to make you understand  
It's not the songs and it's not the band  
I'm still afraid but I'm doing the best I can  
Given grace and all the saints  
You'll never be near me  
You got your drummer  
You got your faith  
I've re-defined the laws of friends  
And what won't happen ever again  
And I will never feel this way about another person  
And I will never feel this way again  
I want to make you understand  
It's not the drugs and it's definitely not a man  
I'm still afraid but I'm doing the best I can  
Doing the best I can  
I'm doing the best I can  
That's enough for now.  
That's enough for now.  
That's enough for now.  
That's enough for now.  
Now I practice the art of forgetting...  

It's only perfection  
You're only running scared  
You just might get there  
You burn it  
Deserve it  
It's got a rope around your neck  
It wants your last breath  
God save you  
Save you  
Save you  
God save you  
Save you  
You're bleeding  
Receding  
Believing every little lie  
You're so tired  
And it's hurting me  
And it's hurting you  
And it burns through  
Every thing you touch  
I miss you so much  
God save you  
Save you  
Save you  
I'm not blaming you  
Blaming you  
Blaming you  
God save you  
Save you  
She's an innocent freak  
She's an innocent freak  
She's an innocent freak  
And I'm bored  
God save you  
Save you  
Save you  
God save you  
Save you  
I'm not blaming you  
Blaming you  
Blaming you  
God save you  
Save you  
Save you  
God help me  
Help you  

Seether is neither loose nor tight.  
Seether is neither black nor white.  
I try to keep her on a short leash.  
I try to calm her down.  
I try to ram her into the ground, yeah.  
  
Can't fight the seether  
Can't fight the seether  
Can't fight the seether  
  
I can't see her till I'm foaming at the mouth.  
Seether is neither big nor small.  
Seether is the center of it all.  
I try to rock her in my cradle.  
I try to knock her out.  
I try to cram her back in my mouth, yeah.  
  
Can't fight the seether  
Can't fight the seether  
Can't fight the seether  
  
I can't see her till I'm foaming at the mouth.  
Keep her down, boiling water.  
Keep her down, what a lovely daughter.  
Oh she is not born like other girls,  
But I know how to conceive her.  
Oh she may not look like other girls,  
But she's a snarl tooth seether. Seether!  
  
Can't fight the seether  
Can't fight the seether  
Can't fight the seether  
  
I can't see her till I'm foaming at the mouth.  
Yeah

It's a shame you have a mind of your own now.  
Shame on you, completely setting the tone now.  
I've caught you bleeding under my skin now.  
I fought you, but you're beginning to win now.  
Well I don't care, I swear it's my turn now.  
Shimmer, shimmer like a girl should, yeah.  
Shimmer, shimmer like a girl should, yeah.  
Shimmer, shimmer like a girl should,  
You gotta get it glimmer, shimmer, sparkle while you can.  
Shame crashing, falling off of the tracks now.  
Get cracking at the small of my back now.  
I failed you and they're beginning to talk now.  
I nailed you until you're walking the walk now.  
Well I don't care, I swear it's my turn now.  
Shimmer, shimmer like a girl should, yeah.  
Shimmer, shimmer like a girl should, yeah.  
Shimmer, shimmer like a girl should,  
You gotta get it glimmer, shimmer, sparkle while you can.  
Yeaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.  
(do-doot-do)  
Shimmer, shimmer like a girl should, yeah. x4  
Yeah, shimmer, shimmer like a girl should, yeah.  
Shimmer, shimmer like a girl should, yeah. x3  
Shimmer, yeah, shimmer, yeah  
Shimmer like a good girl.  
(do-doot-do, yeah.)  

Sick  
Sick of the night  
Sick of the day  
Sick of the sun that burns you  
White  
Knuckling it  
Wasting away  
Color yourself back in again  
You're as sick as your secrets  
You're as sick as your secrets  
You're as sick as your secrets  
Slip  
Into the bath  
Into the grey  
Hating yourself so much it hurts  
Wake  
Up from a nap  
Wish you were brave  
But you're not that kind of person  
You're as sick as your secrets  
You're sick of it  
You're as sick as your secrets  
You're sick of it  
You're as sick as your secrets  
You're sick of it all  
I'll take you back  
I'll take you on  
I want you to crack  
I want you to crawl  
I'll take your mistakes  
I want you to break  
I'll bring you home  
Scared  
Scared of yourself  
And what you might say  
So you just let the phone ring  
Hey  
You could come back  
Back to L.A.  
You used to like the summer  

Found a place where we can talk  
I found a way to reach a little ground  
Keep your castle in my sandbox  
Build it up so we can burn it down  
  
Anyway I love my man  
Love to keep him spinning round and round  
Keep him feeling love for my hand  
Any way to turn him inside out  
  
I don't want to go down like the sunlight  
I don't want to go out like the moonlight  
I don't want to be found at the sound of the bell  
The sound of the bell  
  
The sound of the bell  
Meet me up and down again  
Every time is sweeter than the last  
Once you get a taste of impact  
  
You're always hungry for the crash  
I don't want to go down like the sunlight  
I don't want to go out like the moonlight  
I don't want to be found at the sound of the bell  
  
The sound of the bell  
The sound of the bell  
And this is everything  
I have loved  
  
Yeah, I have loved  
Break  
My  
Heart  
  
Down, I don't want to go down like the sunlight  
I don't want to go out like the moonlight  
I don't want to be found at the sound of the bell  
The sound of the bell  
  
The sound of the bell  
I don't want to go down like the sunlight  
I don't want to go out like the moonlight  
I don't want to be found at the sound of the bell  
  
The sound of the bell  
The sound of the bell  
Yeah  
(I don't want to be found in the sunshine  
  
I don't want to be dim like a night light  
I don't want to be down like the sunlight  
I don't want to go out like the moonlight

You sleep better when you're  
You eat better when you're  
You sing better when you're  
You need me more when you're straight  
Is this the weekend?  
Is that your girlfriend?  
She's green and innocent  
You smoke her like she's incense  
She's smilin'  
  
I'll wait 'til summer's over  
I'll love you through October  
I'll give you everything  
I'll trade you anything for her  
Stay straight for me  
Stay straight for me  
Stay straight for me  
Stay straight for me

You're so wonderful, I adore you,  
I adore you, I adore you, Victrola.  
You're so audio, don't remove me,  
To a movie, I am grooving, Victrola.  
Ahhh... Happy New Year

With you so near  
We both live here  
Happy New Year,  
You're my sweet dear Victrola Victrola-ahhh-ahhh.  
  

Wake up dead  
You're entitled to  
A night or two in bed  
Without disguises  
Wake up dead  
You've decided to  
Spend eternity without surprises  
Wake up dead  
You're excited to  
Wake up dead  
But I will accept you  
Til the sun falls down  
And I will protect you  
Til the sun falls down  
Wake up dead  
You're invited to  
Take a midnight stroll  
With Mephistopheles  
Wake up dead  
You're awake enough  
To know just what it takes  
To get away from me  
Wake up dead  
You're excited to  
Wake up dead  
But I will accept you  
Til the sun falls down  
And I will protect you  
Til the sun falls down  
And I will respect you  
Til the sun falls down  

Roll the dice  
Now I wipe the tears from the skies  
Play your hand  
How I love my Marlboro man  
  
Say your prayers  
'Cause you've got enemies everywhere  
Your wetsuit is keeping you warm  
In your cold bed, I'll never be torn from you  
  
Try to keep it together  
You try your best to forget her  
Silly me, always a sucker for monogamy  
Honesty seems to bring out the better in me  
  
Wish I knew another way to ruin the day for you  
Your wetsuit is keeping you warm  
In your cold bed I'll never be torn from you  
Try to keep it together  
  
You try your best to forget her  
I just can't leave you this way  
When you're not okay  
Trains will pass through here someday  
  
And take you away  
But you won't let me hit the ground  
When my heart slows down  
Your wetsuit is keeping you warm  
  
In your cold head I'll never be torn from you  
Try to keep it together  
You try to keep it together  
  
Keep us together (ah)  
Keep us together (ah)  
Keep us together (ah)  
Keep us together (ah)
