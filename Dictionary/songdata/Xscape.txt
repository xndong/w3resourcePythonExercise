Am I dreaming, baby,  
Are you for real?  
  
Verse One:  
(Ol' Skool):  
Things are kind of hazy,  
And my head's all cloudy inside.  
Now I've heard talk of angels, baby,  
But never thought I would have one to call mine.  
  
(Tiny):  
See you are just too good to be true,  
And I hope, there's not some kind of mirage,  
With you, oh baby.  
  
Chorus:  
Am I dreamin',  
Am I just imagining you're here in my life?  
Am I dreamin',  
Pinch me to see if it's real,  
Cause my mind can't decide.  
  
Verse Two:  
(Ol' Skool): Will this last for one night,  
(Kandi): Or do I have you for a lifetime?  
(Ol' Skool): Please say that it's forever,  
And that it's not an illusion to my eye.  
  
(LaTocha):  
And I hope that you just don't up and disappear,  
My love, I pray,  
That it's not a hoax, and it's for real, oh.  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
Bridge:  
(Ol' Skool): Baby I know,  
Sometime, say that sometime,  
I need you to show me girl.  
Show me that you're not a mirage,  
(LaTocha): Oh baby, I need you, I need you, I need you.  
Oh, I need you to pinch me, baby.  
(Ol' Skool): I need you to pinch me baby,  
Am I dreamin baby?  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
Break:  
(Ol' Skool): My mind can't decide, no no,  
(LaTocha): Oh, baby,  
Touch me baby, feel me baby.  
(Ol' Skool): I want to know if you'll be right there,  
(LaTocha): Oh oh oh...  
(Ol' Skool): I want to know if you'll be right there,  
Tell me this is not an illusion.  
(LaTocha): Touch me baby, I want you to feel me baby,  
(Ol' Skool): Somebody let me know,  
I want to know if you'll be right there,  
If it's real,  
This is not a mirage, no.

Let's get down  
Let's get down  
  
You claim you've been waiting  
With no game  
Just anticipating  
How it would be  
If you and I were in the sack  
But to me  
You look like you wouldn't know how to act  
  
I need someone to hold me  
(All night long)  
It must be you my darling  
(Am I wrong)  
It ain't a damn thing baby  
Show me what you can bring  
Cause some try to swing but they still can't hang

(You gotta know how to keep this boat afloat)  
Cause in my mind think your gonna slip baby

Cause if it's on the real  
I come with mad sex appeal  
Flip light delicous  
You know the deal  
Hey that's me  
I be the chic  
The one with the physique  
I freak you in the sheets  
I take a nigga deep down under  
I make him wonder  
How to make the lighting come before the thunder  
That's the pleasure I bring  
I make a nigga get up and sing:  
Tinga linga ling ling  
I got the pow  
Da boogie and the bang bang  
You can't hang don't talk da game  
  
You and me, let's get down  
Even though you claim that you've been around  
I betcha can't hang

[Verse One (Tamika):]  
The snow is falling like I knew it would,  
Carolers are already singing.  
Last year is all that I can think about,  
Everytime I hear sleigh bells ringing.  
[Bridge (Tamika):]  
But I know,  
That when summer came I pushed you away,  
I should have never let you go, no  
Now all I'm really trying to say is...  
[Chorus:]  
I want you to come home,  
I know that there won't be a christmas without you,  
I miss you so much.  
You're all that I want,  
I know that there won't be a christmas without you,  
I miss you, come home.  
[Verse Two (Kandi):]  
I remember all the love we made,  
I miss your stocking on the fireplace.  
Underneath the mistletoe we stayed,  
Twas a very special holiday.  
[Repeat Bridge (Tiny)]  
[Repeat Chorus]  
[Verse Three (LaTocha):]  
There's a fire that's still burning in my heart tonight,  
There's no reason why we both should be alone.  
It's the night before Christmas,  
And I'm waiting here for you to come home, come home.  
[Repeat Chorus to fade]

Hey baby, I want to know one thing.  
Do you want me as much as I want you?  
Say you do  
  
Never should have kissed you  
Never made that call  
I told myself  
In love I shouldn't fall  
Would've been a pleasure just to know your name  
Oh, look at me, silly me, now I'm back in love again  
And there's nothing you can tell me  
Nothing you can do  
I just hope that you're in love with me  
The way that I'm in love with you  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Do you want to  
Like I want to be in love with you  
Say you do  
Do you want to  
Like I want  
I want to make love to you  
Say you do  
Never understand it  
Love that takes control  
Oh, I asked myself  
Girl should you let it go?  
That would be to crazy  
Love without you  
Hate to think  
Happily that you won't be around  
Now there's nothing you can tell me  
Nothing you can say  
Promise me you'll stay with me  
Until my dying day

Time has been short since you left me,  
So I can't help but think,  
Of how things between us used to be.  
You were a piece of my heart,  
And I thought we were swell,  
Until you told me you were leaving,  
To find a better life for yourself.  
Oh I...  
  
I wish we were together again,  
Loving the way we used to love,  
Boy I miss you much.  
I wish we were together again,  
Oh how I'm missing you,  
It's so hard for me to say goodbye.  
  
You know that I love you,  
And for you there ain't nothing in this world,  
That I won't do.  
If you would only come back to me,  
And let me show you how loving me could be.  
  
I, I've got feelings,  
But you act like you don't care,  
You treat me so unfair.  
  
Love has no meaning,  
Since you walked right out my life.  
You've touched a part of me,  
Can't you see that I'm in need of you?  
  
I wish we were together again,  
Loving the way we used to love,  
Boy I miss you much.  
I wish we were together again,  
Oh how I'm missing you,  
It's so hard for me to say goodbye.  
  
I wish we were together again,  
Loving the way we used to love,  
Boy I miss you much.  
I wish we were together again,  
Oh how I'm missing you,  
It's so hard for me to say goodbye.

[Chorus]  
How do you love someone,  
Who really cares?  
How do you love someone,  
Who's always there?  
When you feel like going further,  
Will end up hurting each other.  
So how do you love someone,  
Who's a friend so dear?  
  
Feeling so alone,  
Calling you, please be at home.  
Baby where you go,  
I wish that I knew, but I don't.  
And there are feelings of love,  
That I feel inside for you.  
I want to tell you tonight,  
But what if you don't feel the way I do.  
And I know what love can do,  
When the arrow points at you,  
But I'm so afraid to trust.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The clock strikes nine,  
I'm hoping you'll be on time.  
So hard to cross that line,  
That holds us to the right time.  
'Cause everything feels wrong,  
And I can't go on, like this.  
I've got to tell you tonight,  
I want you to tell me more what this feeling is.  
'Cause I know what love can do,  
When the arrow points at you,  
Even though I'm afraid to love.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I know you love me,  
Now my feelings just won't take on someone new.  
Look at my eyes and say the words,  
That make me wonder what to do.  
And I still believe that the angels are watching us,  
Oh I believe that you and me will be a plus,  
For ever and ever.  
  
[Chorus until fade]

Is my living in vain?  
Is my giving in vain?  
Is my singing in vain?  
Is my praying in vain?  
  
No, of course not.  
  
It's not all in vain,  
Because up the road is eternal gain.  
  
Am I wasting my time?  
Can the clock be rewind?  
Have I let my light shine?  
Have I made ninety nine?  
  
No, of course not.  
No, of course not.  
No, of course not.  
No, of course not.  
  
It's not all in vain,  
Because up the road is eternal gain.  
  
No, of course not.  
No, of course not.  
No, of course not.

It's not all in vain,  
Because up the road is eternal gain.

No no,  
Tell me, tell me.  
  
Keep it on the real,  
(the real, the real, the real, the real, the real, the real, the real).  
  
Trust is something that we can't live without,  
Honesty must be there, ain't got no room for no doubt.  
Reality can't waste no more of our precious time,  
Trying to escape the pressures of our mind.  
  
I don't ask for much, no no,  
Baby if you want me you gotta tell me something, yeah.  
All I want from you is just to keep it comin',  
Keep it on the real.  
(the real, the real, the real, the real, the real, the real, the real)  
  
Faithfully I'll give my loving to you,  
Soulfully our spirits will make it through.  
Respect me baby and I'll respect you,  
What more can two lovers do?  
  
I don't ask for much, no no,  
Baby if you want me you gotta tell me something, yeah.  
All I want from you is just to keep it comin',  
Keep it on the real.

I got something for you,  
And I think you're sexy,  
And if you want me let me know.  
You ain't gotta spend no money,  
Just a little time with me honey,  
That will let me know you love me so.  
  
There are so many things,  
That I want to talk to you about.  
Like do you want me, do you love me,  
'Cause I have my doubts.  
  
I have a funny feeling,  
That you want me around for just one thing,  
To push your little ego,  
With the knowledge that I bring.  
  
I got something for you,  
And I think you're sexy,  
And if you want me let me know.  
You ain't gotta spend no money,  
Just a little time with me honey,  
That will let me know you love me so.  
  
You know that I want you,  
And I made it very clear.  
I would never ever hurt you,  
I'd never let you shed a tear.  
  
The only thing I want to know,  
Do you feel the love for me.  
I'm not gonna keep on waiting,  
That's not how it's gonna be,  
You got to...  
  
Let me know,  
I never knew that love could ever have me slipping.  
Let me know,  
I sit in my room thinking of you at night trippin'.  
Let me know,  
I never knew I would ever get caught caking.  
Let me know,  
And no man would ever have me shaky.  
  
I got something for you,  
And I think you're sexy,  
And if you want me let me know.  
You ain't gotta spend no money,  
Just a little time with me honey,  
That will let me know you love me so.

And I think you're sexy,  
And if you want me let me know.  
You ain't gotta spend no money,

Uh, star struck hoes beg me to connect with em  
'Cause I look correct with em and knows how to sex them  
Houses on two acre lakes in the Peach State  
Eat steak and lobster, steady tryin to prosper  
  
Build up my roster like the ol Motown  
Too much to hold down and the whole world know now  
I demonstrate stackin' paint platinum tapes  
And bustin that ass with groups like XSCAPE  
What the deal? Uhh  
  
I want to see if you can get down  
Get down like you say you do  
In the midnight when I want to feel right  
All I think about is you  
  
Put me in a fly position  
Make me want to scream your name  
And just when you think I've had enough  
I'm like baby do you think we can do it again?  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
'Cause everytime you show me that  
And every which way that you throw my back  
I just can't get enough  
I find myself sayin "let's do it again, let's do it again"  
  
Tingle tingle my body  
You make me oohh baby  
I ain't been the same since then  
That night when you put me in a fly position  
  
You made me scream your name  
You can say I'm sprung out, I don't give a damn  
I want to do it again and again and again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Bridge]  
When we made love for the first time  
It felt so good inside  
I laid across my bed and watched tears run from my eyes  
Too good to let it go  
So don't disturb this flow  
All I know is I can't wait  
Can't wait to do it again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(In the morning) 'cause everytime you show me that  
(Sweet love in the summertime) and every which way that you throw my back  
(Just your sweet face) I just can't get enough  
  
(all laid up next to mine) I find myself sayin "Let's do it again, let's do it
again"  
'Cause everytime you show me that (Let's do it again)  
And every which way that you throw my back (again, again)  
I just can't get enough  
  
I find myself sayin "let's do it again, let's do it again"  
Let's do it, do it, do it, do it, do it again

Love's a funny thing  
  
Was only last night I felt you slip away,  
I tried so hard to hide the pain inside of me babe.  
I held you close but you weren't with me,  
I felt your mind a thousand miles away.  
  
I was a fool to let you break me down,  
You think by now that I would know,  
Just what to expect from you, oh.  
Everytime I fall, I make myself believe,  
That you are changing,  
And some day, the sun will shine through.  
  
Love is a funny thing,  
Your love is a funny thing,  
Love is a funny thing,  
Oooh.  
  
(I don't wanna fall, don't wanna fall in love again)  
  
When I first met you your heart was empty,  
You were innocent and so full of joy.  
But now you've changed and I don't know you,  
You played me baby like a toy.  
  
You see, I was surprised to see you with that girl,  
When you said you'd never ever ever ever see her again, no.  
I don't want to control you, so baby if she's gonna hold you,  
Then why don't you just stay, stay where you've been.  
  
Love is a funny thing,  
Your love is a funny thing,  
Love is a funny thing,  
Oooh.  
  
(I never never wanna fall again, no no no)  
  
Everybody needs someone to hold them through the night,  
And everybody needs someone to tell them it's alright.  
I gave you my heart and you only turned away,  
So tell me baby, what's going to make you stay.  
  
Love is a funny thing,  
Your love is a funny thing,  
Love is a funny thing,  
Oooh.  
  
(I never ever want to fall in love again)

Verse One (Tamika):  
I went out looking for a good place,  
But everywhere I went was dull.  
I went here, and I went there,  
But I never found the stuff.  
But then I met this boy that said  
He had the perfect place,  
That I would just love, yeah.

I found my spot,  
Nothing about the place seemed dull.  
And the stuff I was looking for,

The sound was hot, like I never heard before,  
The bass was booming,  
There were people all over the dance floor.  
Then I met another guy,  
And he asked me would I like to dance,  
He showed me steps I never seen before.  
I walked in,  
Ooh, let me tell you girlfriend,  
The place was jumping,  
And it was sho 'nuff pumpin'.

Verse 1:  
Its been so many days  
So many hours  
Since we went our separate ways  
And I'm still here missing you  
What am I supposed to do?  
When there's  
So many things  
That remind me of  
That times that we shared  
Just the two of us  
I can't understand it..  
Why does it have to be this way..  
Tell me what..  
Chorus:  
Baby..what do I do..  
When im..so in love with you  
I could never..never ever  
Love this way again say...  
Ooooo(5x)  
Verse 2:  
Lying in the bed..  
We used to share..  
The only thing missing..  
Is your not here..  
I Reminisce on the love we made  
You used to drive me crazy  
When you said my name  
And when you kissed me there  
Ohh baby..ohhh wee baby..  
Tell me what do I say?  
What do I do..  
When I'm still in love with you  
Chorus (x2)  
oooo (x5)  
Bridge:  
What did I do to deserve this  
All I ever wanted was to make you happy  
Baby tell me where did we go wrong  
I need to know..where is the love (x2)  
Chorus(x2)  
ooo (x5)  

I know that you're going  
I can't make you stay  
I can only let you know I love you anyway  
And if the road you take leads to heart break somewhere down the line  
If someone ever hurts you  
Or treats your heart unkind  
  
You just run to the arms of the one who loves you  
You just run to these arms and these two arms will keep you warm  
When rain has failed your heart, never fear, I'm never far  
You just run to the arms of the one who loves you  
  
I want you happy, I want the best for you  
And if you have to leave to find your dream  
I hope that dream comes true  
But if the world you find brings you hard times, if someone makes you  
cry  
I'll be there to hold you, I'll be standing by  
  
You just run to the arms of the one who loves you  
You just run to these arms and these two arms will keep you warm  
When rain has failed your heart, never fear, I'm never far  
You just run to the arms of the one who loves you  
  
My love is strong enough you know  
Strong enough to let you go  
But I always hold you inside my heart  
And if you should ever change your mind  
You can come back anytime  
And when you do (and when you do)  
  
You just run to the arms of the one who loves you  
You just run to these arms and these two arms will keep you warm  
When rain has failed your heart, never fear, I'm never far  
You just run to the arms of the one who loves you  
  
You just run to the arms of the one who loves you  
You just run to these arms and these two arms will keep you warm  
When rain has failed your heart, never fear, I'm never far  
You just run to the arms of the one who loves you

But you been sleepin' and you're creepin', babe,  
But you been creepin' and you're sleepin', baby.  
  
It's Friday night and I've been freakin' out,  
900 times, I know I called your house,  
So many times your momma cursed me out,  
But I'm not sorry.  
  
Saturday morning, I ain't slept at all,  
I smelled her perfume and your alcohol,  
They say that you and her have had a ball,  
Don't you dare lie to me.  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
I know I'm gettin' the runaround,  
I know that you sleep around,  
So don't try and play it down,  
I know you're givin' it, I know she's gettin' it.  
  
I grabbed my keys and I jumped in my ride,  
I may be hurt but I ain't gonna cry,  
Just want to find out what you did last night,  
Before I leave you.  
  
I found her number and I know her name,  
I gotta front this girl, make her explain,  
I can't believe she dipped into my thing,  
Yet she's getting over.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It took a lot for me to give you all my loving, yeah,  
And just to think I gave you everything for nothing.  
I tried my best to satisfy you,  
All the times that I stood right by you,  
I think that I'll be better on my own, baby.  
  
Oh baby,  
I know your givin' it, I know she's gettin' it.  
  
But you been sleepin' and you're creepin' babe  
But you been creepin' and you're sleepin' baby  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Now I can't believe that you did this to me,  
Well, you better leave.  
You go tell what's her name that it isn't a game,  
Boy you messed up your thang.

My man done left me on a midnight train,  
He said he wasn't thinking of ever coming back again.  
He told me he wanted me to find somebody else,  
He done left me here all by myself.  
Tell me...  
  
What can I do?  
What, I'm still in love with you.  
Tell me what can I do?  
What, I'm still in love with you baby.  
  
When it first started it was all good,  
The things you done to me I never thought that you would.  
Didn't give me a reason why it had to end,  
I can't believe you left me for another ladyfriend.  
  
You know I've been searching for someone,  
Who could share that special love with me.  
  
I thought you was the one, I gave my trust to you,  
I'm such a fool, I want you back,  
Tell me what am I to do?  
  
What can I do?  
What, I'm still in love with you.  
Tell me what can I do?  
What, I'm still in love with you baby.  
  
I'm sitting by the phone, all alone,  
Tell me what can I do, tell me, tell me...  
  
What can I do?  
What, I'm still in love with you.  
Tell me what can I do?  
What, I'm still in love with you baby.  
What can I do?  
What, I'm still in love with you.  
Tell me what can I do?  
What, I'm still in love with you baby.  

Verse One:  
(LaTocha):  
As I stand here contemplating,  
On the right thing to decide.  
Will I take the wrong direction,  
All my life, where will I go,  
What lies ahead of me?  
(Tamika):  
I have strong determination,  
And I'm not afraid of change.  
I have yet to find that someone,  
Who would care to satisfy me,  
To stay right by me.  
  
Chorus:  
Who can I run to,  
To share this empty space?  
Who can I run to,  
When I need love?  
Who can I run to,  
To fill this empty space with laughter?  
Who can I run to,  
When I need love?  
  
Verse Two:  
(Tiny):  
And my mind is so confusing,  
Who would be that special one?  
Everyday I'm trying to find you,  
All along, I've got to know,  
Is there a place for me?  
(LaTocha):  
I know love has many names,  
And a message very clear.  
All it takes is time and patience,  
To bring you near,  
But look at me, tell me  
  
Repeat Chorus

[Chorus:]  
Know, don't you want to know, don't you want to know,  
Know, who's that man?  
[Repeat]  
[Verse One (Kandi):]  
He's got a different little style than other men today,  
He does his thing with a swing.  
And everything you see him do is in a different way,  
You never ever seen before.  
[Bridge (LaTocha):]  
He's not your ordinary slick uptown type of brother,  
Don't think twice 'cause you'll never find another.  
Because the man behind the mask,  
You've never ever seen him before.  
[Repeat Chorus]  
[Verse Two:]  
[All]  
He's got the flava to do his his thang,  
He's got something everybody wish they had,  
[Kandi]  
And something tells me you don't want to make him mad,  
No you don't, no you don't, no you don't.  
[Repeat Bridge and Chorus]  
[Repeat Chorus]  
[Repeat Verse One, Bridge and Chorus]  
[Repeat Chorus to fade]

[Chorus]  
I want to spend my whole life with you,  
There's nothing else better than being with you.  
I want to spend my whole life, my whole life with you.  
  
Do you remember all those precious times,  
We shared back in the past.  
No one knew about the things we did,  
Out in the grass.  
  
We're older now,  
And we both need companionship.  
So let's stop these games,  
And get on with our relationship.  
  
Ain't no second guessin' about  
The way I feel when I'm with you,  
It makes me feel so real.  
Ain't no living without you,  
'Cause you're all the man I need,  
And I want you just for me.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Why is it when I say I love you,  
You shy away from me,  
When lovin's all I want to do?  
Even though we've never been,  
  
More than just friends,  
There's no reason  
We should have to let our feelings end.  
  
Ain't no second guessin' about  
The way I feel when I'm with you,  
It makes me feel so real.  
Ain't no living without you,  
'Cause you're all the man I need,  
And I want you just for me.  
  
[Chorus]

Play me some music, and pour me some wine.  
I'm in the mood now, I got love on my mind.  
I want you to know, that I like it real slow.  
And whenever your ready, you can slide off my clothes.  
And touch my body, anywhere,  
I'm yours tonight, make it right,  
Baby just take me there.  
  
[Chorus]  
Take your time and work me slowly (work it),  
Cause I'm the kind of girl,  
Who needs the kind of guy,  
That can last, (work it).  
Don't need a man around,  
If he's throwin' down too fast,  
You gotta work me slowly.  
  
Now change your position, and keep it right there.  
Just go with my motions, rub you hands through my hair.  
I hope you don't mind it, if I let out a scream,  
Cause it's feeling to good to me, it's more than I dreamed.  
It's more than pleasure, it's ecstasy,  
Up and down, round and round,  
Baby just come with me, take your time.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Then in the morning,  
We'll do it all over again,  
(do it all over again)  
I don't want this feeling to never end.  
I can't believe how your loving me,  
You give me all,  
I can't believe your still stroking me,  
Cause baby your taking it all.  
  
[Chorus]

You're not in control when there's demands put on your heart.  
You don't even know, cause when it's real you fall too hard.  
And yet even so, you try to play like nothing's wrong,  
No you can't run away, there is no hiding place,  
'Cause you can't run from your heart.  
  
[Chorus]  
Your eyes they tell me secrets that you, you can't deny.  
Your eyes they show me feelings that you hold deep inside.  
How do I know the secrets that you try to hide?  
'Cause when I look in your eyes, the truth is alive,  
I knew you'd be mine.  
  
So now that it's on, it's time to face reality,  
It's time to be strong, take all your insecurities, baby.  
Don't be afraid, you gotta let your feelings flow,  
No you can't run away, there is no hiding place,  
You gotta be true to your heart.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now that you're all turned out,  
Don't you just love the way that it feels?  
Now you can't do without my love,  
And you know that's for real.  
  
Now why you deny yourself,  
I will never never never understand,  
Because I love you and you love me too,  
And that's just the way that it is yeah.  
  
[Chorus]
