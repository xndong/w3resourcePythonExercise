in the beginning  
there was no light  
no teenage heaven or hell  
no songs or voices came  
from across the outlands  
where oceans were ment to be, where oceans were ment to be  
oh my god, i feel so alone  
some million light years far from home  
how about you who are living in the 20th century  
carol  
you better stop to get the tickets  
for the starlite show  
everybody wants to be there  
what a dream  
so if you don't mind,  
will you join me  
on my way through the eye  
up to the light  
into the world

There's a doubt in my heart  
And it's sinking deep inside of me  
It's the way that you talk  
It's in the way you're touching me  
When I look into your eyes  
You're a million miles away from me  
And there's nothing I can do  
There's nothing left to say  
You'll break my heart, there's nothing left to say  
You'll break my heart,there's nothing I can do  
You'll break my heart...  
Rip it off and watch it fall..  
Will you go - will you stay  
Is there any chance for me to keep you here  
  
By my side - or is my fate already sealed  
Is there anybody else  
Or am I still the only one  
If it's so then I don't care  
Just waiting for the blow to come  
You see, there's nothing I can do  
You'll break my heart (in any case) there's nothing left to say  
(you'll break my heart...)  
Rip it off and watch it fall...  
You'll break my heart, there's nothing left to say  
You'll break my heart,there's nothing I can do  
You'll break my heart, rip it off, rip it off  
You'll break my heart...  
Gold, Friday 13th 2001, salt lake city

All in the golden afternoon full leisurely we glide  
For both our oars, with little skill, by little arms are plied  
While little hands make vain pretence our wanderings to guide  
Ah, cruel three! in such an hour beneath such dreamy wheather  
To beg a tale of breath too weak to stir the tiniest feather  
And what can one poor voice avail against three tongues together  
Anon, to sudden silence won, in fancy they pursue  
The dream child moving through a land of wonders wild and new  
  
In friendly chat with bird or beast- and half believe it true  
And ever as the story drained the wells of fancy dry and faintly strove that
weary one to put the subject by  
The next time. it is next time the happy voices cry  
Thus grew the tale of wonderland, thus slowly, one by one  
It's quaint events were hammered out  
And now the tale is done and home we steer  
A merry crew  
Beneath the setting sun

That I denied one time too many  
She left me at the break of day  
When I awoke she seemed still spinning in my head  
But she was gone, the capsule empty and her body dead  
Was all she'd left behind without a last adieu  
Sometimes I wonder if she'd left a hundred years ago  
To start anew we need to be strangers from now on  
And as for love we need to be strangers from now on  
  
And I remember when she came into my life  
It didn't count who she was or what I was like  
I never meant to hurt her but she never did  
Her name was love, her bodies infinite  
And now she is gone, the capsule empty and her body dead  
Sometimes I wonder if she'd left a hundred years ago  
To start anew we need to be strangers from now on  
And as for love we need to be strangers from now on

I'm going out, I don't know why, there's no need at all  
A kind of turbulence outside and I can't resist the call  
I hear a siren, I might be late, fire flickers on a barricade  
A piece of smack melts in my brain as I watch the police deploy  
And I wonder  
  
Did not expect to meet you here in the middle of the fights  
I should have known, you got it all, you want to burn tonight  
Out in the riots you looked somehow divine  
You gotta kill a cop sometime  
  
A random motion that's what you are, these days are so bizarre  
And I wonder to see your face in a place like this  
Reflecting the flames  
  
You see the market there across the square  
It's closing time but all the doors are broken  
Why don't we step inside, it's free for everyone, you see  
It's paradise, well alright  
  
And I wonder to see your face in a place like this  
Reflecting the flames

Welcome, or should I say goodbye  
It's a question how close we are apart  
Are you going back home after this show  
Or leaving for the wild  
And when you passing the wardrobe  
What will you take  
Your worn out hat of hopes  
Or someone else's attractive furs to make it through  
The playgrounds of your life  
  
All is shown  
All shut down  
All the world is gone  
All the pieces came together  
  
Finally, but not too late  
All is shown  
All shut down  
All the world is gone  
  
Just pretend that I'm not there  
Make your choice  
I love you anyway  
Just make your choice  
Pretend that I'm not there  
  
All the world is gone  
All the world is gone  
  
Just take it  
Just take it  
And you'll make it  
Alright, yeah  
Ride on, ride on

Into this world we're thrown  
A lifeform without a home  
Clowns in a circus called the material world  
Gods without immortality, nothing to lose  
Nothing to gain, nothing to keep  
Shepherds of dreams, we are what we are  
  
Lovers, losers, loners, leapers, liars  
The meaning of life and I want to touch  
Your astral body !!!  
We are what we are  
Oh, we're so full of light, don't let it die  
And I want to touch your astral body !!!  
  
And if I put pennies on your eyes or pyramids  
On your grave, mysteries mountain high  
The day I have to go  
But before I leave, I just want to feel love !!!  
I want to touch somebody else than me  
  
We are what we are...

Oh, I want to know I want to go  
Through that situation again, I'd like to catch  
That something in your eyes it thrilled me once again  
That gentle touch I can't describe  
It's like a reflection of the moon on the water  
Don't let it go, because of you the earth stood still  
Just do it again  
Burn, burn away, sacred letters, ragged backdrops  
I don't care, the certainty of death,  
The boring rituals of life they seem so far  
I don't care for my life, I just live for your love  
That is because of what you do, just do it again  
Because of you the earth stood still  
Just do it again

Winter's cityside  
Crystal bits of snowflakes  
All around my head and in the wind  
I had no illusions  
That I'd ever find a glimpse  
Of summer's heatwaves in your eyes  
You did what you did to me  
Now it's history, I see  
Here's my comeback on the road again  
Things will happen while they can  
I will wait here for my man tonight  
It's easy when you're big in Japan  
  
Aah when you're big in Japan-tonight  
Big in Japan-be-tight  
Big in Japan ooh the eastern sea's so blue  
Big in Japan-alright  
Pay! - Then I'll sleep by your side  
Things are easy when you're big in Japan  
Oh when you're big in Japan  
  
Neon on my naked skin, passing silhouettes  
Of strange illuminated mannequins  
Shall I stay here at the zoo  
Or should I go and change my point of view  
For other ugly scenes  
You did what you did to me  
Now it's history I see  
Here's my comeback on the road again  
Things will happen while they can  
I will wait here for my man tonight  
It's easy when you're big in Japan  
  
Aah when you're big in Japan-tonight  
Big in Japan-be-tight  
Big in Japan ooh the eastern sea's so blue  
Big in Japan-alright, pay!  
Then I'll sleep by your side  
Things are easy when you're big in Japan

On na round-about I'm turning on to you  
Don't you love the way we're turning, yes you do  
Little schools of hummingbirds are streaming by  
While we're merging with the color of the sky  
Big yellow sun  
You're the one  
Here's our souls  
Heal them, heal them  
Beutiful girl  
You're the world  
I'm in you, bretahing  
Love me do  
At the entrance of the airport as you see  
There's an icecream-man who's selling sweets for free  
You might watch descending rockets from the moon  
While we're taking off with 99 ballons  
Bless our souls...  
Big yellow sun  
You're the one  
Here's our souls  
Heal them, heal them  
Beutiful girl  
You're the world  
I'm in you, bretahing  
Love me do

I love to see your moves,  
It's so devine you dance  
I love to see your moves,  
It's so devine you dance  
When you're struttin' your legs  
Ain't no gravity on this planet  
When you're struttin' your legs  
Ain't no gravity anymore  
And I walk-walk-walk like an astronaut  
With your Monroe-smile on the screen of my eyes  
And every giant step I take  
Melts the snow on the roof of the world  
And the stars like burning wheels roll by  
Burning wheels roll by  
I'm the blossom's scent  
Since you stick in my soul like a flower  
I'm a blossom's scent  
Since you're comin' on down like a shower  
And my heart is a golden bell  
I can't keep it from tolling  
Yes, my heart is a golden bell  
And I can't control it anymore

I'm living in a perfect world  
Embedded in a perfect game  
Can't get enough of all this stuff  
But everything is quite the same  
And all the cigarettes and pills  
All the visions, all the thrills  
They seem to come second hand  
I wonder if you understand  
The mirror is a brilliant place  
To lose myself within a maze  
They moved the moon when I looked down  
And then they turned the stars around  
I try to speak but what's the use  
Instead I scream, I'm so confused  
And when I tried to touch your face  
You disappeared without a trace  
Just see me through  
And please believe me what I'm telling you  
(you disappeared without a trace)  
Don't bring me down  
I'm standing naked here in front of u  
Just when I tried to touch your face  
Just come on here  
What do you think that i can do for you  
I might have lied so many times before  
But this time I'll be true  
  
These days are fast, they seem like glass  
They rushing in and then they pass  
They have no value anymore  
They seem like clones or metaphors  
And honesty is what we hate  
It's what we're trying to escape from  
I wash my hands a million times  
Like Pilate when he did his crimes  
When we are young we're wild and free  
When we get old we're history  
I struggled hard to fit the mold  
I hope I die before you're old  
It doesn't matter what we gain  
When all our does or dies are in vain  
And when the music fades away  
Our memories just go astray  
Just see me through  
And please believe me what I'm telling you  
(and when the music fades away)  
Don't bring me down  
I'm standing naked here in front of you  
(your memories just go astray)  
Just come on here  
What do you think that I can do for you  
I might have lied so many times before  
But this time I'll be true...

Caroline says  
Are you really sure that you know me  
I never met you before, can I trust you  
But she's never cautious, no, never, will she ever learn  
Wil she always send her dreams and poems to imaginary people  
  
And she's tough, yes, real tough  
Standing right in front of the revelation  
All of the big city lights may shine on her eternally  
And caroline's eyes show feelings not from this world  
And if some one asks her, where do you come from  
She thinks for a while before she answers  
  
I don't know, I really don't know  
And she says, there's no destination on this spiral highway  
I don't know, I really don't know  
And she says, I can give you names but I can never give you answers  
  
And she says, listen to the music of your soul  
Follow where it's telling you to go, follow in the footsteps of your soul  
Listen to the music, don't you know, it'll lead you where you what to be  
It's playing there for you and me  
  
Caroline says while looking at the polaroid in her hands  
Isn't it strange to remember  
And when she's out, she never locks the door, she is always like that  
She could never ever cope with the real life of the ordinary people  
And she says, hey, listen to this, I should be leaving here tomorrow  
It's so cold in this city and there's not enough money in the streets  
And caroline's eyes show feelings not from this world  
And if some one asks her  
Where do you go to, she thinks for a while before she answers  
  
I don't know...

We must have played  
For more than ten years  
We must have thought  
That we're immortal  
Shame, shame on us,  
Ah little hussy,  
What did you think I was  
I look at us  
We have grown older  
A lot too much  
For me to take  
I thought  
We were immortal  
I'm so sorry  
I couldn't keep my promise  
To carry on your flag for you  
Some superhero-being  
  
It seems to me  
That we are changing  
There ain't no limit to imagination  
The world just turns around  
Without a care  
Sometimes I feel like crying  
And every time  
I need to touch you  
How can I ever  
Break the distance  
That's why my love  
Became so strong and pure  
That's why I keep on  
Trying forever  
To carry on your flag for you  
Some superhero-being  
For you  
Some superhero-being  
Waiting  
Under the light of the moon  
For you  
I'm coming soon.

We can change the world...  
The difference is in the way...  
The difference is in the way we are as people  
The difference is the sum of what we are  
So look at the things that join us together  
And take away the things that pull us apart  
Ooh, we can change the world...  
The light that draws us through the tunnel of perception  
Is brighter than the light  
That makes us shield our eyes  
Just believe in the idea and it's purity  
No need to question it's source,  
No need for lies  
Ooh, we can change the world...  
Love of my life, we can change the world...  
We can change...  
Changes...  
The magnetism  
That you feel inside  
Draws you closer  
To the heart of the matter  
And the wisdom  
That you see outside  
Is only a mattter  
Of learning  
And forgetting  
Ooh, we can change the world...  
Love of my life, we can change the world...  
  
Lyrics: gold, hine

Pretty baby, don't you know, times they are a changin'  
Every little moment we grow up we lose control  
Life's a loaded gun with no directions  
And it keeps you on the run, it has no mercy  
Mum and daddy went to war  
Never coming back no more  
Did you ever think they'd make you whole again  
Maybe someone dropped a bomb  
Just right into the middle of your soul-they're in control  
You got to get out of control again  
No more control again  
You're getting whole again  
Ain't no control again  
You got to get out of control  
  
Twentieth century honey bee  
What you're doing is what you'll be  
Life's no dress rehearsal when you bring the honey in  
Everything seems wrong to thee  
Tortured from the poison of reality that has no mercy  
All your friends went for the thrill  
Now it's yours to grab the kill  
Did you ever think you're getting whole again  
Maybe someone send a priest  
With some religion cooking in a bowl  
They're in control  
You got to get out of control again  
What's the fucking thing about control  
Did you think you'd ever getting whole  
Just as long as there is no control  
They have no control of you at all

I sleep between the gates of night, in a no man's land  
Always closer than you think, a kind of your best friend  
I have no religion and I have no flag  
I don't care if you're wrong or right  
Lilac skinned or black  
  
I'm a cosmopolitician  
Closer than your next of kin  
Angel, devil of the night  
And the seed of everything  
  
And if your world has turned to ashes  
I will leave you never  
Even when the sun's blown out, I will shine forever  
I caress you with my charms  
I'm your best friend, the dream  
I'm the light that guides you through the nights  
And deepest haze  
  
I'm a cosmopolitician...  
  
You need a friend without a doubt  
I wonder why you came around  
Are you awake or do you dream  
You're stuck inside a frozen scene  
You try to move but there's no moves  
You try to speak but there's no use  
You try to wake but you can't  
You close your eyes without a chance  
You need a friend without a doubt  
I wonder why you came around..

When the heat of light melts into the speeding time  
When the king returns to the ivory cityside  
Let the Magnet Mages wave the signals  
Flashing oh so fast  
Then you'll meet me there under the moonshine  
In a lover's heaven, we'll keep our promises at last  
In a lover's heaven we'll forget the past  
Do you want to dance with me  
Through one of those lonely nights  
It's more than a dream  
Maybe we're reaching the gardens of delight  
Do you want to dance with me  
Through one of those lonely nights  
It's more than a dream  
Maybe we're drowning in empires of delight  
  
In the stardust dawn underneath the crystal roofs  
Where the solar boys are playing games  
They never lose  
Where the sailors are swaying  
Through the lightdomes shining in the sky  
There you'll meet me, darling, anyway  
In a lover's heaven, we'll keep our promises at last  
In a lover's heaven we'll forget the past

Sometimes I feel wherever I go, I leave no man's land behind  
And God is a pet and the devil's a toy, and I'm a danger in your paradise  
Here I go  
Here I go  
Sometimes I feel wherever I go, I leave crimson roses behind  
With a toy in my hand and a pet at my side, I spread roses,  
Roses in your paradise  
  
Here I go, with a toy in my hand and a pet at my side, here I go  
Here I go, I'm a danger in your paradise  
  
And life is a pretty, impolite bastard  
I spit at you, I spit at you, I spit at you, bastard  
I want to cut out your chameleon tongue  
I'm a danger in your paradise  
  
Here I go...  
  
Sometimes I feel wherever I go, I leave crimson roses behind  
With a toy in my hand and a pet at my side  
I spread roses, roses in your paradise  
And life is a pretty, pretty gigolo  
I caress you, I caress you, gigolo  
And God is a pet and the devil's a toy  
And I'm a danger in your paradise

People buzzing around,  
They don't know a thing  
They just a laugh  
And the ones in power are always pulling the strings  
People do what they do,  
How much can they take  
They just get the news  
And the ones in power always get the cake  
But you got ambition,  
You got the face, come on, let's go to a dangerous place  
You got the class, I think you're desperate,  
Let's go to a dangerous place  
Come on, let's go, come on,  
Let's go, come on  
I promise this thing will sell,  
I promise I'll take you to heaven  
I promise this thing will sell, and I just can't wait  
You have your plans, all these plans  
And there are moments,  
Shall I call them a chance  
If I was you I would make them all mine  
And if I ain't got the power I would commit a crime  
But you got ambition  
I promise this thing will sell  
I'm gonna make you a deal,  
You know I'm your friend  
I'm gonna stay with you until the very end  
I know you got the guts,  
I got a lot of time  
I'm gonna make me yours  
Before I make you mine

When you feel so far away though you're close to everything  
And the feeling of estrangement's creeping up on spider's legs  
Even in these days of wonder, even in the age of faith  
There are some who goin' under  
There are some who never got it made  
So you passed so many years in a labyrinth of traces  
Running round and round they led to no one but yourself  
Here comes the eternal stranger  
He who has fallen from grace to the iron grounds  
And I'm tolling my bell just to let you know  
I'm here by your side in these days full of wonder  
In the ashes of your time when the dragon screams for more  
The reptiles make their comeback in your eyes  
And heroes fall for heroin and heaven falls for fake  
And doris' daisies burn to hell on the grand parade of lies  
In the middle of the night when the last of God has died  
And the only friend you've got is the heartbeat of the clock  
That music plays for all time, the tv light is freezing  
The war-paint on your face..  

There's a new sensation, a fabulous creation  
A danceable solution to teenage revolution  
Do the strand, love, when you feel love  
It's the new way, that's why we say  
Do the strand  
Do it on the tables, Quaglino's place or Mabel's  
Slow and gentle, sentimental  
All styles served here, Louis seize he prefers  
Laissez-faire le Strand  
Tired of the tango, fed up with Fandango  
Dance on moonbeams, slide on rainbows  
In furs or blue jeans, you know what i mean  
Do the strand  
  
We're playing our tune by the pale moon  
We're incognito down the Lido  
And we like the strand  
Had your fill of quadrilles, the madison and cheap thrills  
Bored with the beguine, the samba isn't your scene  
If you feel blue look through who's who  
See La Goulue and Nijinsky  
Do the strandsky  
Weary of the waltz, mashed potato schmaltz  
The Sphinx and Mona Lisa, Lolita and Guernica  
Rhododendron is a nice flower  
Evergreen it lasts forever  
But it can't beat the strand power  
Do the strand

He is sitting on a hill  
A vapid night is crawling through the vale  
The trees are fangs of transiency  
The demons forge hammers and nails  
He will travel all the ways  
That lead to the unknown lands  
Time has distorted his view  
An amen in his due  
He is gazing at the skies  
Without yearning in his eyes  
And he will follow the invisible trace  
When the sirens sing again  
The spring is in the air, the silence in the skies  
The wind is in his hair, the moon is in his eyes  
The bats play on but he'll be gone  
Before the world has left the night  
The birds sing on but he has gone  
Before the morning spreads its light

Woke up in the morning still I heard this song  
Must be somewhere from my dreams, I don't know  
Made me feel so good, sun was shining bright  
God, I love you that you brought  
This little song to give me  
Faith  
In the morning  
I need that faith  
To go on, yeah  
Give me some faith  
Can't get enough of that sweet feeling, give me faith  
Oh yeah, I keep the faith  
  
Sweet little girl, lying next to me  
Sunlight's playing on your face with soft shadows  
You're so beautiful, dream on, dream on, baby  
I'm gonna wake you up when the time is right  
I'll give you  
Faith  
One day I shall be released by my creator  
Going home to where I came from long ago  
And the big wheel keeps on turning round and round  
Into eternity with me to cosmic meadows  
I will be there with all my friends  
In the morning  
I need that faith

I hear those voices on the radio  
I switched it off because she told me so  
She's an investigator, she's like an elevator  
Nobody told me we'd be all alone, you know  
  
Somewhere my friend had left me in that twilight zone, you know  
She said, I've seen your deepest secrets now  
They're just as lightning in the look of your eyes  
I said, I want you baby, I said, I want some more  
  
I said, I never ever felt it like that moment before  
She's an assassin, she's melting steel in my heart  
And I beg for more  
She said, I want your body, she said, I want your soul  
  
She said, a fallen angel takes it and she'll never let go  
She's an invader, she's from another world  
And I beg for more and more  
She's raising feelings cutting like a knife  
  
She's pouring fire into my liquid life  
There's no escaping from her mysteries  
She gives me kisses of the strangest kind, she says  
I know you'll like it, so come over here, she says  
  
And let that rhythm filter through your body, dear  
And then she  
She always did it and she always will  
She'll stay that hunter till the end of time  
  
I said, I want you baby, I said, I want some more  
I said, I never ever felt it like that moment before  
She's an assassin, she's melting steel in my heart  
And I beg for more  
  
She said, I want your body, she said, I want your soul  
She said, a fallen angel takes it and she'll never let go  
She's an invader, she's from another world  
And I beg for more and more

hello today  
open your eyes  
the snow is falling just like leaves  
aquarian warriors rebuild the ship  
mr rainbow is gone  
hello my love  
here's to your heart  
unfold the lillies in the deep  
the season's over, the shores are sealed  
now ashen roses rain on the fields  
innocent dreamers, look what you've done  
now it's time for the phoenix to fly  
hello today  
wake to the dawn  
to meet the guardians of the isles  
the valient captains will rule the seas till the comets return  
hello my love  
here's to your heart  
release that dream into the world  
join in the air race, leaving tonite  
how does it feel to follow the light  
beautiful dreamer, it's up to you  
if we glide through the glamour of love  
we believe in our dreams  
reaching out for above  
we believe in our dreams  
reaching out for love

I've been searching for so long  
Now I'm chasing the shadows away  
I've been trying, yes I tried to find my way  
No more crying in the make or break decade  
There were times when I was down  
There were times I felt so low  
My whole life just seemed to be  
A senseless quest for energy  
But I carry your flame  
All through my life, I'm a believer  
Peace deep in our hearts, all things must pass  
But we'll be together again  
  
I've been walking  
I've been walking in the rain  
When the angel of my intuition whispered hello  
Well I was quite surprised to face  
That kind of incarnation  
Love comes always unexpected  
Love strikes blind and undirected  
Love is the answer  
Love is all we need my friend  
How you came and changed the weather  
How I wanna live forever  
I carry your flame  
All through my life, I'm a believer  
Peace deep in our hearts, all things must pass  
But we'll be together

We waste our time with big illusions  
Talking to the walls  
But Jericho will never fall  
We sold our trumpets long ago  
  
Exchanging all the best we had  
Into atomic masterplans  
We read the books we had our chance  
We spend the world for just one dance  
  
So keep on dancing, all you fools  
The cups of fury have been filled  
So keep on dancing, all you clowns  
Lets have a sip before we're killed  
So keep on dancing  
  
These politicians make me sigh  
Democracy is just a lie  
As long as we are rich enough  
Each gouvernment will do for us  
  
We feed like vampires on the world  
We are the first, they are the third  
There ain't no hope, we had our chance  
We spent the world for one last dance  
  
So keep on dancing ...  
  
7 seals  
7 trumpets  
7 plagues  
7 cups  
  
7 angels  
The scarlet beast  
Mother of harlots  
Faithful and true

Oh, I love to dance  
Under an alien sun  
Along the dunes with you, I kiss you in the sand  
We give so that we live  
Beside the sleepy snakes  
They dream of you and me when will they ever end  
For a million years they dream  
For a million years they dream  
And the fog conceals and hides and eats our souls  
Before they open up their eyes again  
How far we'll be  
Remember me  
  
Won't stop loving you, although it seems to be  
Our time is running out, I'm leaving you behind  
No matter what they say, we'd never meet again  
Our love is bigger than our lives  
And we know that yesterday  
The moon was brown  
And that today it is black  
And that tomorrow it is red  
And we know that when we go to the sun  
The moon comes along  
(Hello there!)  
And the cows in the pasture graze  
And we know that we know what we know  
Is it truth?

I feel so lonely when I'm not with you  
It's such a shame that I'm spending my time  
Without you  
Yet I have found you're from a different world  
It must be Venus cause love's such a prime time  
With you, girl  
Don't you understand  
We ride on a space-ship out of control,  
How sublime  
Who's breaking who's heart first  
You say you can't do it, mama  
Yes you can  
It's so easy to do  
By giving me less of your love than you have (hold) in your heart  
My baby,  
Just one little kiss from your lips  
Is enough for a light year or more in love  
You're breaking my heart  
Each night that I don't get enough  
Each night, and I can't get enough of you  
Each night and I can't get enough of you  
Each night and I can't get enough

Come in close to me and bring me joy  
Lift me higher, much higher and higher than light allows  
I wanted to be everything, everything for you  
I wanted you, I needed you, I thought that you did too  
You built me beauty and took it all away  
And I can't face another day...  
I'll die for you today...  
  
Tempt me, sweet tempest - and shower me with stars  
I want to be as beautiful as you  
Take me to the summit and show me  
Show me all that I could ever have  
You brought me everything, I ever thought I wanted  
And now you take it all away  
You gave me love and then you killed me blindly  
I think I'll die for you today, I can't persue another way...  
I'll die for you today...  
  
Like a garden growin' in flames  
A forest filled with fear of the wind  
Like the moon so beautiful from afar  
But shattered on the surface, full of scars  
A sea with no more fish, planets without air  
Whales with no more song  
I know I'm gonna die with them today...  
I'll die for you today...

Sometimes it feels so strange  
The way I feel for you  
It makes my life so quiet and free  
And when you smile at me  
It's just that special love  
A kind of liberty I've never felt before  
  
And I don't need to be a poet  
I don't need to be a hero  
When all I need to do is keep on  
Loving you  
  
I just have to be me  
And I don't need to be  
The stranger anymore I used to be  
In my impossible dream  
  
I keep my fingers crossed  
I never want to lose  
This new found world that's so alive, Angel  
I'm so in love with you  
  
My heart has circled in the past  
The demons of deceit but now  
Aside I've cast  
  
And I don't need to be a poet  
I don't need to be hero  
When all I need to do is keep on  
Loving you  
  
I just have to be me  
And I don't need to be  
The stranger anymore I used to be  
In my impossible dream

If you need a holiday somewhere in the sun  
Let me show you something that is really fun  
Take a sparkling holiday somewhere in bubblegum  
You can lie down in the shadow of electric silver trees  
You can play ferry sinking victim looking water-ski  
And if you want excitement ask the poet kids  
They all look like Charly Manson a bit  
Take a sparkling holiday it's such a fun  
You might have a quite interesting sightseeing tour  
Go to hangover purgatory nightmare shore  
See the damned and the dead and the died for love  
The commercial gurus, the artist and the stuff  
And if you come to lovey church  
Sit down in second row  
You can hear your sister screaming in the room below  
And the priest will claim thus they might be sure  
A girl can either be a saint or a whore  
Take a sparkling holiday  
Come to the old bridge where the jokers  
Juggle with your fears  
Give them a penny and they'll show you  
How to exercise  
And under the bridge the junkies shoot sperm  
It's so expensive these days  
And they substitute the yearning  
And if you want to dine, go to Loony's Inn  
They serve sweet, good collapse with trauma and gin  
And afterwards you may need a rest  
Then I'll tell you Pere Lachaise is the best  
Take a sparkling holiday

Your hand full of hours, sand from the urns  
A traveling companion, the secret of ferns  
From darkness to darkness, where shall I begin  
When whiteness attacked us, sewn under our skin  
And there were the stars  
That helped to navigate our souls  
With all my love, I went into the world  
From inside out, and I gave it all to you  
But I need your love, that was looking for me  
Just on my lips look for your kiss  
And always I think where we might have gone  
If we'd never met inside this song  
Our names are enciphered  
But the words became true  
When I was the sun and you, you were the moon  
And there were the stars

Standing on the empty bridge  
Watching river's waves go by  
Feeling mellow, lighting a cigarette  
Silver moon floats through the night  
  
Eris, princess of the isles  
Disperse your sparkling traces  
Lead me on to the house of love  
Where the gods may turn my eyes  
  
To jerusalem we pray, it's time to meet you there  
Let's take love to Jerusalem, oh yeah  
Let's take love  
You might be the one I'm waiting for  
  
I think we've met somewhere for sure  
Chasing shadows leaves you feeling blue  
This situation needs a cure  
New assassins, new messiahs  
  
Keepers of the balanced law  
Strangest lovers of the fire  
Which ignates the halo of our souls  
To Jerusalem we pray, it's time to meet you there  
  
Let's take love to Jerusalem, oh yeah  
Let's take love  
Big yellow cadillac, carry me back home  
On glory roads of pure delight  
  
We head out for the stars

lonely boy  
gazing on the afternoon  
people drifting cross the surface of the twilight day  
there's a little yellow man  
standing by the railway station  
painting portraits on the brickwalls  
of billie holloway  
lovely lady smile,  
dance, my dear,  
i'm only operating on lassie come home  
this was authentic you, she spoke,  
this was authentic you who blew me cold  
she had no chance to realize,  
it hit her straight between the eyes,  
so i've been told  
in the park, she's giving out some photographs  
on which she's giving out some photos of what she hands around  
they videoed a ghost tonite,  
she said before i turned it off  
it rode an orange paper bike  
and left without a sound  
keep on riding, sir, open up the door  
and shout it out  
lassie come home, come home  
this was authentic you, she spoke,  
this was authentic you who blew, who blew me cold  
i had no chance to realize,  
it hit her straight between the eyes,  
so i've been told  
lonely girl  
dancing in a music hall  
lightning struck her silver starship  
and turned it into stone  
and now she's falling all the time  
into that void beyond her grey eyes  
somewhere a telephone is ringing  
but nobody's at home  
hello, junkie sweetheart  
listen now, this is your captain calling  
your captain is dead  
keep on riding, sir, open up the door  
and shout it out, shout it out,  
shout it out  
shout it out  
lassie come home  
this is your captain calling  
we're falling all the time  
all the time  
lassie come home

baby  
what do i do  
playing my tune for you  
just to get you in the mood  
everybody's going to hollywood  
you're driving me mad  
but i'm smiling to the crowd instead  
a lot of money is at stake,  
this is a hit and that's a fake  
this is what you mean to me  
this is what they all should see  
make a make up in a foolish style  
telling the truth by making a big lie  
when i come, i come but nothing's at ease  
breaking up the whole is a modern disease  
maybe you think tomorrow's just a joke  
it's a joke after joke after joke after joke  
my love  
everything's an interview  
and nothing's really new  
and everybody's looking for clues  
and you know what to do with a clue  
my love  
get ready for the show  
they're waiting and they will never go  
this night is just a go  
and it's only for show  
dig that deal and be a millionaire  
drinking cocktails in the stratosphere  
getting jetlagged with my business friends in these supersonic wonderlands  
there's a flicker on the graphic display,  
first he's smiling then he's fading away  
maybe he thinks tomorrow's just a joke  
it's a joke after joke after joke after joke

Life's a garden, life is king  
Life is all and everything  
Life is golden, life is fair  
Like a rainbow in your hair  
Life's a once fantastic light  
Life is shining in the night  
Life's a fire from above  
Life is you and life is love  
Life is golden, life is king  
Life is all and everything  
Nothing to believe in  
It's just there, without a care  
And no religion than the enigma of love  
Life is king  
Life's a poison much too strong  
Makes you running on and on  
Life's a drug  
And not your friend  
Life will kill you in the end  
Life is smooth and life is friction  
Life is such a contradiction  
Life is god  
And god needs lives  
Life's a billion battle cries  
Life is golden

(David Bowie)  
  
It's a god awful small affair  
To the girl with the mousy hair  
But her mother is yelling no  
And her father has told her to go  
But her friend is nowhere to be seen  
As she walks through her sunken dream  
To the seat with the clearest view  
And she's hooked to the silver screen  
But the film is a saddening bore  
Cause she's lived it ten times or more  
She could spit at the eyes of fools  
As they ask her to focus on  
Sailors fighting in the dancehall  
Oh man, look at those cavemen go  
It's the freakiest show  
Take a look at the lawman beating up the wrong guy  
Wough man, wonder if he'll ever know  
He's in the best selling show  
Is there life on Mars?  
It's on Amerika's tortured brow  
And Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow  
Now the workers have struck for fame  
Cause Lennon's on sale again  
See the mice in their million hordes  
From Ibiza to the Norfolk broades  
Rule Britannia is out of bounds to my mother  
My dog and clowns  
But the film is a saddening bore  
Cause I wrote it ten times before  
It's about to be writ again as I ask you to focus on  
Sailors...

If I was a flag I'd have no nation  
Just the colours and the wind  
And if I was a church I'd have no treasure  
Except the prayers and the hyms  
And if I was a seagull I'd just rise up  
And carry my soul across the sea  
Drifting beyond the horizon  
Lost by the ground to be free  
If I was a life-boat I'd be waiting all my life  
For another stormy day  
And if I was a dolphin I'd be playing all the time  
Just playing my life away  
And if I was a kite I'd just be laughing  
And dragging you up to the sky  
Setting you down on a white cloud  
While a seagull's floating by  
And the silence roars like thunder

I'm on my way to the other side  
I've broken doors and shattered glass  
I've derailed from the joyrider train  
And listened to the sounds of the insane  
I've looked for wisdom every hour  
Searched for decay in every flower  
Ionized all the sacred schemes  
And killed the prophets in my dreams  
  
I've torn james joyce to pieces to make the puzzle fit  
I've looked for secret messages in every little bit  
I've travelled through the craters of despair  
Grabbed the holy signs in every nightmare  
Broke on through to the other side  
Paid the one way fare, paid the one way fare  
  
I'm on my way to the other side, there's nothing I can do about  
I tried to hide behind perfection and starred in mirrors of deception  
There's no escape in any way, nowhere to run, nowhere to stay  
As long as I can't see the light I got to go to the other side  
  
I've torn james joyce to pieces...  
  
I've torn james joyce to pieces to make the puzzle fit  
I've looked for secret messages in every little bit  
I've spoken to the dead, ignorants have called me mad  
I've travelled through the craters of despair  
Grabbed the holy signs of every nightmare  
Conjured up digression, suffered from depression  
Paid the one way fare, paid the one way fare  
  
I'm a missionary man  
I'm a missionary man

Sometimes it seems the night will last forever  
sometimes it seems that darkness always falls  
a dark star woke you up and with a dark star, you go to bed  
you're sinking slowly into the deep  
you wonder if you ever touch the ground  
where you would walk through sparkling spheres,  
on strangest drugs and without fears  
you feel just like a little girl  
and all your dreams lie frozen on the moon  
you left them ther some time ago  
but it ain't true that you don't need them anymore  
you are so beautiful, you are so very beautiful  
don't give up, kill the pain, don't start crying again  
here it comes, here it comes, the golden handshake of life  
you are so beautiful, you are so very beautiful  
keep the faith, stop to fight  
and walk out into the night  
you're so strong, yes you are  
reach out for your star....  
Even those who are afraid to live  
they're dying some day  
sometimes it seems that silence crawls all over  
sometimes it's hell inside and hell out there  
your heart is nothing but a haunted place  
is that you in the mirror?  
You're all alone inside a world  
full of confusion and of strange alarms  
and though your courage left you long ago  
it doesn't mean that you don't have it anymore

You're playin' around with money and fear  
And a power you can't control  
And the zimmermen grin their perjured grins  
Sayin': there's no risk at all !  
Look into the eyes of the next generation  
I know you would never dare  
You're layin' the tracks  
Of the ultimate sin  
Like himmler and you don't care  
It only takes a few words  
It only takes a few  
To cut a long story short  
It only takes a few words...  
Oh my how it hurts..!  
Look into the eyes of the next generation...  
Look into the eyes of the next generation...  
Yor orders filtered through the ranks  
Intentions you can't hide  
With tightened lips  
You're sinking ships  
In the shadows of the night  
You presidents of genocide  
You ministers of crime  
You're laughing at your firemen  
From miles behind,  
From miles behind the lines..!  
It only takes a few words  
It only takes a few  
To cut a long story short  
It only takes a few words...  
Oh my how it hurts..!

This  
Is our place  
In the free and open air  
Under starry skies  
By the endless sea  
In an endless chain  
We are locked together  
I became a star  
You were my creator  
Never have we been closer than tonight  
You and I when our shadows crossed the light  
Never have we walked  
Further wondrous ways  
And this is where we stand  
Here on the beach  
And I'm tolling my bell  
In the fog to let you know  
I'm here by your side  
In this madness called life  
Though the knights have all gone  
And we lowered our flags  
I sing you this song as the tides wash the sands  
On the beach  
Take my hand like I once took yours  
Look me in the eye like I once looked in yours  
Here we go again, speaking in strange codes  
Reading all the stars  
Like an open book  
On the beach

So you hugged the globe  
Now it's whirling too fast  
I really got no hope to hang on to the past  
The train has departed, the toxins have started  
To announce that none will last  
I cower in the gutter of a world that's not so near  
And I listen to their mutters that are spinning through the air  
The words unspoken, the promises broken  
And the ones who really care  
I'm the watcher of the scene  
I see our shadows on the screen  
And when the subway brakes to preserve some suicidal bee  
I stop to breathe for a while  
Maybe it was me  
This is the world gliding by  
Like the driftwood beams  
On a lifetime's stream  
The instant fundamental sky for Pandora's lullaby  
  
I see distorted faces coined like gold  
And in their wrinkles programs that commercial gurus told  
A watermark against a spark  
Umbrellas that they hold  
I'm gliding in the distance and watch the world go by  
An orbit full of questions, a perforated sky  
But I just sit and wonder a bit that they never wonder why

Let's dance  
Stop to fight  
We do the paradigm shift tonight  
Yeah, it's a natural drift alright  
  
And it's coming up out of the blur  
Out of your mind from deep below  
The hidden harmonies discover  
Chaos which means order  
Evolution's not a model of yours  
  
For quietness is stronger than motion and silence is stronger than sound  
We're listening to the tone which is not played  
Nothing is what we want  
Nothing is what we get  
  
Nut the holistic moment of all  
Yes, that is the way  
Do you hear the river flow  
  
You talked yourself into wrong questions  
You don't care about the answers  
You let the others be the good ones  
You're part of the deathbringing system  
  
There's no place where you can hide  
Stop! chasing the wrong gods of time  
I'm running out of time  
Time kills  
  
You're lowering hopes much too much, getting into the grind much too much  
And losing faith in your abilities  
The loyalty to your beloved system of belief must surrender  
To chaos which means order, evolution's not a model of yours  
  
For quietness is stronger than motion  
Do you hear the river flow,  
Do you hear it?

It's nothing serious, just a simple case of bottles  
I left behind  
It's nothing serious, just a wooden case of bottles  
I left behind  
It'll go away someday, well alright  
It'll go away somehow, come on do your thing  
It's nothing dangerous, just a solid block of concrete  
I left behind  
It's nothing dangerous, just a solid block of action  
I left behind  
It'll go away someday, well alright  
It'll go away somehow, come on do your thing  
Peace on earth, God in heaven, peace on earth  
Living in heat, memory melting in pools of dirt  
The genetic plaything is eating what I left behind  
It'll go away someday  
Walking in the streets of Pnom Penh  
Giving me dangerous feelings and then  
Seeing those bottles in motion again  
Cruising in cocktails  
Peace on earth, God in heaven, peace on earth

The gentle taste of orange  
A garden of fruit and flowers is what I embrace  
In ocean blue eyes, in each one's an island  
I'm stranded within your love  
And as I fall deeper than ever  
And as we kiss, we're each other's guide into the unknown  
Where men do not return, where men do not forget  
The sweetest suicide, as if we don't exist but live  
The presence of angels, the inscense of Indochine  
The quietness of movements, the slowness of Africa  
A Point of know return, no way out of here  
Nothing compares to you  
Anything goes  
And as I breathe deeper than ever  
I'm coming home, I'm coming home to the unknown  
Where men do not return. ..

If you meet a long forgotten friend  
And he takes you in his arms and smiles  
And he tells you long forgotten tales  
And he takes you home for a nightride  
And he begs you, please, stay here with me  
In the end you agree  
Remember: you're just being recycled  
  
So everything you say  
Somebody else said it before you  
And everything you do  
Somebody else just did it like you  
And the man in the lab just grins and says  
Holding up a tiny can with a sperm  
Remember: you're just being recycled  
  
Montego bay  
  
The air is oh so thick  
There's not a single breeze  
The day lies dazed upon the shelf  
Beyond a painted window out on a far horizon  
There stands a steamboat in the sun  
  
I rised my eyes and stared into that paralyzing light  
But god had left the iron skies  
This day will last forever, we pushed the final buttons  
And someone disconnected time  
  
We are here in montego bay..

little girl, do you know what you are, do you know  
this baby's gonna be a star, do you know  
a teenangel empress from hollywood highs  
with wonderful eyes  
your beautiful, put on your stratoblue suit  
i know that your in the mood to fly  
we got the power to make it come true  
the most exciting news  
we'll be together till the end of time  
and when you smile, red rose, it's just like blue sunshine  
oh, we're ascending and we'll never die  
cause when we kiss, red rose, we're changing 6 to 9  
it's revolution time  
when 6 turns into 9  
move over, closer to my fantasies, pretty baby  
we're standing at the turn of the centuries  
the daughter of time is dancing tonite  
little dreamer, you're the d.j. of your soul  
c'mon, lets swing to that rock and roll  
the sweetest arrows of desire will set this dance on fire  
above the city of the million moons  
we'll reach the palace of the sun  
do what you will shall be our destiny  
we will unfold the secrets of the new jerusalem

here's a boy  
with a little black dog  
there's a boy  
with a little black dog  
and he looks  
at his watch  
for a while  
and the falling years  
wash away his make up  
and the falling years  
wash away his make up  
just like rain  
on the fading snow  
he's a lonesome streetside romeo  
you can see him from your window tonite  
this world's a devided place, you know  
he's awaiting you  
we're all lonesome streetside romeos  
you can see us from your window tonite  
we all change our points of view  
sometimes  
we're awaiting you  
all the boys  
are locked in a fortress  
all the girls  
are locked in a fortress  
just because  
it's a crime  
it could be,  
it could be  
flesh and blood  
in iron and steel  
flesh and blood  
in iron and steel  
just because  
it's a crime  
it could be,  
it could be  
we're all lonesome...

Little darling  
On the factory floor  
Sirens are wailing  
They are calling you like lovers  
They always want more  
  
Department 27  
Deep down below  
You are piecing together  
The seeds of the world  
  
Ashen roses  
Growing darkness  
Starving children  
Someday you stand up and dance  
  
Glittering sunlight,  
Keep on shining  
And put them together  
The seeds of the world  
  
Binding all the flowers of the world  
Start bursting into millions of colours  
Unfold all the flags of the nations  
Kiss me again, let the battle start  
  
Little darling  
What have you done  
Hearts are breaking  
Live without ending,  
Numberless men  
  
Never relaxing  
I have to see it all  
Fire, desert, cold and arid  
And all in a flash  
  
Binding all the flowers of the world  
Start bursting into millions of colours  
Unfold all the flags of the nations  
Kiss me again, let the battle start

She's like a frostfern in my head  
The lamplight burns my eyes and then she fades away  
My pencil's frozen in my hand  
And the letter I can't write, it seems to be a desert without end  
  
I woke up late at night  
She called me up then disappeared  
And the echo of her voice filled the empty places in my dreams  
With the silent tide  
  
She fades away  
Again  
She fades away  
She fades away again,  
  
Don't go now, please stay  
My senses are cruising through a void  
As pale reflections play on the deserted road  
I hear a humming of machines  
  
A distant sound like thunder  
Crawling through the cold  
There's no escape, I know,  
I run around in circles without end  
  
And the more the memory grows  
Dissolving from reality  
With the silent tide  
She fades away...  
  
... don't make me cry  
This time, I've got to learn  
I know, she won't return

Hate, lust, soul, rage  
You're so full of hate, you're so full of lust  
You're so full of soul, you're so full of rage  
Spirit of the age  
Here comes the voodoo king, here comes a powerful man  
My face on every front page, my plans for everyone  
I reason your existence, that is what I want to be  
Your whore and your messiah if you believe in me  
I'm not a true creator, I'm just a cheap reflection  
I'm the impersonator of anyone's conception  
But if you read my lips just on your own behalf  
I'll be a remedy not just an epitaph  
You're so full of hate, you need a vacation  
So full of lust, you need liberation  
You need damnation, you need salvation  
You're so full of hate  
Spirit of the age  
Here comes the new religion of everything you are  
My sword is your conviction, my voice your media  
I'm here to justify you, that's what I want to do  
I don't believe in visions but I believe in you  
Here comes the voodoo king, here comes a powerful man  
My face on every front page, my plans for everyone  
I'm here to satisfy you, that's what I want to be  
Your whore and your messiah if you believe in me  
You're so full of crime, you wipe out a nation  
So full of sex, you're a sensation  
You need damnation, you need salvation  
You're so full of fear  
You're so full of hate, you need a vacation  
So full of lust, you need liberation  
You need damnation, you need salvation  
You're so full of hate  
Spirit of the age

the rain against the windshield endlessly  
for many years i cruised around the world  
i've finally disembarked my ship of fools  
a hero then, a stranger to return  
i'd trade my goldrush 'gainst your silvernets  
to know what happened after all this time  
and in your arms i'm lost forevermore  
i wonder how you ever felt in mine  
isn't it strange, i still can hear your call  
isn't it strange, i'm not a ghost at all  
isn't it strange or is it just insane  
isn't it strange, the glory and the fame  
still falls the rain..  
do you remember how we used to play  
and how we waved our banners in the sun  
do you remember how we gave ourselves away  
for some strange kind of fun  
and how we smiled as if we'd understood the writings on the walls  
and cooked our spice on silver spoons  
and if we wouldn't see the light  
we overdosed the foll'wing night  
isn't it strange...  
i've got burnholes in my fingers that could not ease your pain  
or was it me who killed the blue inside your eyes?  
when silence grew behind our shadows on the wall  
but if all was silent, could we hear a bit more?  
i wonder can you hear me now? - isn't it strange  
ohhh...  
isn't it strange, i still can hear your call  
isn't it strange, i'm not a ghost at all  
isn't it strange or is it just insane  
isn't it strange, the glory and the fame  
still falls the rain..

World without a breeze  
Heartbeat of the heat above the harbour  
Lazy day lies dazed upon the shelf  
Atomic lizards lick at the blaze of the  
Light that is forever  
No move in the solid skies  
No gleaming metal out of the  
Breathtaking blue  
  
My golden circus girls all sailed away  
The lion tamers are no longer due to play  
Whoever breaks the seven seals and lets  
The angry angels free  
I do not know  
Just waiting here  
For summer rain  
For summer rain  
Or anything else  
  
Prophet hold your head up  
Into a cluster of bees and listen  
"Love of my life  
Here is all our honey  
Yes, we can change the world, together"  
And if we're still invited to walk  
In this party  
I'd go for a saucerful of secrets or more  
But last thing I heard of was that GOD had  
Left the lines  
For a brandnew universe  
He was supposed to say  
  
My golden circus girls all sailed away  
The lion tamers are no longer due to play  
Whoever breaks the seven seals and lets  
The angry angels free  
I do not care just waiting over there  
For summer rain  
For summer rain  
  
What a glorious feeling  
I'm happy again  
Cool Rain

I can hardly wait to see her coming down the stairs  
A demon's playin' in my head a melody I can't forget  
She's a beauty in her sorrow, each step a falling chord  
That crackles in the giant mirrors at the marble walls  
I feel so different today, I'm ready to explode  
Into kaleidoscopes of strange delight  
Come embrace me, say you'll love me till the very end  
Before I vanish in the shifting sands of time  
Death, the lover  
Death, the lover  
Come embrace  
Say you'll love me  
'Til the very end  
Come, embrace  
'Til the very end of time  
Once I was so sure not knowing  
Leaving traces in the dust  
'Til you said there's nothing new  
Except the things that we forgot  
Here I stand awaiting for a signal from oblivion  
In the twilight of the old uncertainties  
Now she spreads her wings she's comin'  
Like a massive wave of love  
Rolling black as night into my arms  
Now she's comin' in a burning flash of kisses  
Rushing from her lips into the center of my mind.

All I want is you, don't you know that  
Forever loving you, don't you know that it's true  
I'm leaving you tonight but don't listen if they say  
That we'll never meet again in the land of make believe  
We cannot lose the race, breaking the secret spells  
They put on us, my love  
We're far out of their reach, a million years ahead  
They never understand the mysteries of love  
Here's the mysteries of love  
Give your body to the mysteries  
Tear down your uniforms  
Here's the mysteries of love  
All I want to be, don't you know it  
All we wanna be is free like the birds of the sea  
We kiss the last good byes and are sailing with a smile  
'cross the iron borderline that butterflies despise  
We cannot lose at all  
Breaking the secret spells they put on us, my love  
Forever out of reach, a million dreams ahead  
They'll never understand  
The mysteries of love  

With all the grace that you possess  
You're telling me your lies  
A kiss, a touch, a gentle stroke, a look into my eyes  
Your promises and fairy tales have all turned into dust  
Your star was high, your kingdom grew in vain  
Now fades at last  
  
That is the one thing I know  
Stop talking  
Stop talking with that voice  
I can't stand it  
  
When I look into your eyes  
Who do you think you are  
You're too perfect  
But this time you've gone too far  
  
How can you be so sure about those tears you're giving me  
Your mysteries and agonies show no effect on me  
I can't believe the love we shared would ever grow so old  
Your warm embrace was heaven  
But tonight it feels so cold  
  
That is the one thing I know...  
Stop talking...  
I can't stand it  
I can't stand it  
No more

now, she's touched the earth - you feel her love  
pouring down like an endless rain  
of colours on your skin  
she descends out of the blue,  
a breathless victor of time  
after more than a million light-years preparing her comeback  
and she's rushing in  
from the outside  
on the crest of the seventh wave  
she's the crown of creation  
creating you  
the voyager!  
is here to stay  
the voyager!  
she's calling all stars  
the voyager!  
she's riding a rainbow  
the voyager!  
gives you the kiss of life  
watch out, you can't ignore what's going on  
when your visions are drying out  
like the oceans from the underworld  
don't you know!  
before you turn to stone  
you better head out for a royal trip  
to the ivory city-side  
and she's rushing in  
from the outside  
on the crest of the seventh wave  
she's the crown of creation  
creating you  
the voyager!  
is here to stay...

I am an emigre,  
I write to Germany  
In foreign words,  
A tongue of actuality  
  
Hands in grey gloves  
To Germany with love  
A war between the wars  
A war between the wars  
  
Triumph over by  
Gone sorrow  
Can in unity be won  
Let them all pursue this purpose  
  
Till reality is gone  
I am an unexpected spy  
From the outside of my eye  
Translate it first  
  
Then comprehend  
I'm here indeed  
But there I stand  
I write to Germany,  
  
I write to Germany  
To Germany with love,  
To Germany with love  
This is the turn of colours  
  
All real, some still unseen  
There is no more decision  
'Cause there's too much in between  
Let us build a nightmare nation  
  
Learn and work as never yet  
That this cold new generation  
Faith in its own fears beget  
Here comes the modern rat,  
  
Here comes the terror squad  
Ours is the salt of wisdom,  
Here we come all dressed in black  
From the ruins risen slowly  
  
To the future turned we stand  
Flourish in this blessing glory  
Flourish German fatherland  
I write to Germany,  
  
I write to Germany  
All quiet in Germany,  
All quiet in Germany

Central park looks like a graveyard  
It never rained like that before  
I took the ferry to new jersey  
Never coming back no more  
In my hand I hold a ticket  
Statue points up to the clouds  
Now I'm leaving New York city  
I can hear the seagulls cries  
  
Whenever I saw you, it felt like the first time  
Whenever I kissed you, just like the furst time  
Whenever I hold you it was never the same  
And I thought that the last time  
Would never come  
Today  
  
Autumn's sun burns down on berlin  
A turkish bride just passes by  
Someone plans a revolution  
Little kites dance in the sky  
I will always hear your heartbeat  
I will always think of you  
Laughter's ringing from the playgrounds  
As I watch the children play  
Ain't no doubt  
  
Whenever I saw you, it felt like the first time  
Whenever I kissed you, just like the furst time  
Whenever I hold you it was never the same  
And I thought that the last time  
Would never come  
Today  
Here comes the rain  
Right now!

if you want a new connection  
i'll be just a step away  
come on move in my direction  
leave your dollshouse at the breaking of the day  
get this message from your heartbeat  
there's an ally you can trust  
you've been searching for adventure  
follow me, lets take the golden path.

from universal kingdom number one  
he sends his universal angels  
through the air  
to universal dreamers  
everywhere

any boy could drive my car

throwing stones against your windows

but i'd like to meet you all alone...

Waiting  
For a change in the weather  
I'm waiting for a shift in the air  
Could we get it together, ever  
Hoping for your return, hoping for your sweet, sweet  
Return  
Hello  
Is this heaven calling  
Hello, hello, is somebody there, she must be somewhere  
And then she says hello, hello, hello  
She's really an angel  
She stands in the sunshine  
She's closing her eyes, she starting to dream,  
She's pulling the strings  
She's dreaming a strange dream  
  
Where nothing is grey  
Then she takes me away and she's pulling the strings  
When she's playing with love  
She's playing with love  
Counting  
I count every second  
And I'm standing  
I stand in the rain, I walk up that lane  
Which leads to the sunshine  
She stands in the sunshine  
She's closing her eyes  
Then she takes me away and she's pulling the strings  
When she's playing with love  
She's playing with love

I saw you smile, i saw you true, i saw you through  
Today you're in your best disguise  
Where are you now musician, lost your speech, where are you now  
You dragon tamer, tell me please, where are your heroes now  
  
Wake up, you forsaken heaven's sheep, your heaven's cheap  
Wake up, open your eyes, feel the might of the light, i know you've got a sun
inside  
I saw you turn, i saw you burn today, your flickering, empty eyes hurt me like
pins  
Are you still in, tell me...  
  
Where are you now, magician, lost your wand, where are the dreams  
That you have dreamt....when you were a hero  
Where are you now, where have you gone, you're much too beautuful  
To slip into oblivion  
  
Wake up, you forsaken heaven's sheep, your heaven's cheap  
Wake up, open your eyes, feel the might of the light, i know you've got a sun
inside  
I saw you turn, i saw you burn today, your flickering, empty eyes hurt me like
pins  
Are you still in, tell me...  
  
I know you've got a sun inside, i know you've got a sun inside...  
I know you've got a sun  
I know you've got a sun  
Inside

Kind of thunder from my heart  
Flooding my eyes  
Kind of armies marching  
Through my head  
Sombre soldiers  
From nowhere  
Kind of someone's  
Moving out of me  
Have no fear  
Going somewhere  
Ship is leaving right on time  
Empty harbour, wave goodbye  
Evacuation of the isle  
Caveman's paintings drowning  
Famous last words on the air  
I stay here and you are there  
While our city softly sinks  
Cavemen's paintings drowning

It's the start of the season  
The dawning is near  
The age of fish ends announcing the news of the year  
The tiger returns to the jungle  
  
The wolf comes home to his yard  
When you say it feels good to be back  
Then it's just one step further on to the heart  
Getting over, getting over  
  
It's the start of the season  
Creep out of the arc  
Leave your sticky asylum behind and step out of the dark  
There's an open horizon before us  
  
There is a rainbow under my eyes  
The detector reads low radiation  
And you are fearless to rise til you're high  
Getting over, getting over  
  
It's the start of the season  
Over the land  
A mockingbird is singing a song near the tide's restaurant  
As you undress your movie-blue diving suit  
  
Your innocent skin shines so white  
We shall be one  
Under the sun  
Right here in the power of the light  
  
Come to the summer  
Welcome to the sun  
Come to the summer  
Welcome  
  
To the  
Sun  
Welcome

What is love ?  
I'm getting closer to her  
And the closer I get  
The more I lose my fear of loneliness  
  
A step outside in the rain,  
They just close the cinemas  
I'm light years away from you as I drive in my car  
And your love shines like a neon sign,  
  
It ain't so far  
But the distance is unbelievable  
What is love: unbelievable  
What is freedom ?  
  
I guess that I'm free again  
I'm so fucking free to decide  
Whether I'm wrong or right, to win or lose  
I love you, I feel like a little boy  
  
Too little to take all your burning love  
And toy land is melting away in the heat

Look at me, you can watch me  
Listen to me, you can hear me  
Talk to me, you can yell at me  
Play with me, you infuriate me  
  
Look at me, just watch me  
Try to see , but you better not touch me  
Look at me, just watch me  
Try to see me through, but you better not touch me  
  
Does it make you feel better? to know that I'm here to stay.  
Does it make you feel better? to know my heart is locked away.  
Does it make you feel safer? knowing I won't get away.  
Does it make you feel safer? to have my soul in chains.  
  
Watching you, I can look at you  
Hearing you, I can listen to you  
Yelling at you, I can't talk to you  
Feeling you, I wish I could touch you  
  
Look at me, just watch me  
Try to see , but you better not touch me  
Look at me, just watch me  
Try to see me through, but you better not touch me  
  
Does it make you feel better? to know .  
Does it make you feel better? to know that I'm here to stay.  
Does it make you feel .better?  
Does it make you feel safer? knowing I won't get away.  
  
Does it make you feel safer? to have my soul in chains.
