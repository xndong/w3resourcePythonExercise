Break break shake away, break breakaway  
Now I'm free to do what I want to do  
  
Time will not wait for me, time is my destiny  
Why change the part of me that has to be free  
The love that passed me by, I found no reason why  
  
But now each day is filled with the love, that very same love  
That passed me by and that is why  
I can breakaway from that lonely life  
And I can do what I want to do  
And breakaway from that empty life and my world is new  
  
When I laid down on my bed I heard voices in my head  
Telling me now hey it's only a dream  
The more I thought of it I had been out of it  
And here's the answer I found instead  
(Baby baby) found out it was in my head (baby baby)  
(Baby baby) found out it was my head (baby baby)  
(Baby baby) found out it was in my head (baby baby)  
  
And I can breakaway to the better life  
Where the shackles never hold me down  
I'm gonna make a way for each happy day  
As my life turns around  
  
Come on we're free to breakaway (oh boy you jump for joy)  
Now won't you come on (when you breakaway)  
You're free to breakaways (breakaway)  
Come on you're free to breakaway (breakaway)  
Now won't you come on (breakaway)  
You're free to breakaways (breakaway)  
  
Feel the vibrations in all the sensations, breakaway  
Feel the vibrations in all the sensations, breakaway

On my way to sunny California  
  
On my way to spend another sunny day  
  
Water, water get yourself in the cool, clear, water  
  
The sun shines brightly down on Penny's place  
  
The sun shines brightly down on the bay  
  
The air's so clean it'll just take your mind away  
  
Take your mind away  
  
Take your mind away  
  
Have you ever been south of Monterey  
  
Barrancas carve the coast line and the chaparral flows to the sea  
  
'Neath waves of golden sunshine  
  
And have you ever been north of Morro Bay  
  
The south coast plows the sea  
  
And the people there are of the breed  
  
They don't need electricity  
  
Water, water, cool cascades of clear, clear water  
  
The sun dance final scene sets the hills ablaze.  
  
Horizon edges quick up the mountain's way.  
  
Have you ever been down Salinas way?  
  
Where Steinbeck found the valley  
  
And he wrote about it the way it was in his travelin's with Charley  
  
And have you ever walked down through the sycamores  
  
Where the farmhouse used to be  
  
There the monarch's autumn journey ends  
  
On a windswept cyprus tree  
  
Water getwater get yourself in that  
  
Get yourself in that get yourself in that cool, clear, water  
  
The sun shines brightly down on Penny's place  
  
Get yourself in that water  
  
The air's so clean that it just takes your mind away  
  
Take your mind away  
  
Take your mind away  
  
Have you ever been to a festival, the Big Sur congregation?  
  
Where Country Joe will do his show  
  
And he'd sing about liberty  
  
And the people there in the open air, one big family.  
  
Yeah the people there love to sing and share  
  
Their new found liberty

If everybody in the U.S.A  
Could come with us to Californ-I-a  
We could take 'em to a place out west  
Where the good sun shines everyday  
Now there's a touch o' Californ-I-a  
In everyone who's ever been this way  
And when your telephone begins to ring  
And the operator comes on the line

There's some beautiful women  
Gonna find me one  
To show me how to ride the ultimate wave  
In the fifties it was "Hey Daddy O"  
Then came the surfers and the Hodads ya' know  
We had our woodies and our custom cars  
And when we drove around we knew we were bad  
My baby listens to my car radio  
And when we're cruisin' lets the whole world know  
And when our favorite surfin' song comes on  
We always let 'em know it's "Totally Rad!"  
California callin'  
I'll be there right away  
There's some beautiful women  
Gonna find me one  
To show me how to ride the ultimate wave  
California callin'

Gonna show me how  
To ride 'em at the county line  
California callin'  
I'll be there right away  
There's some beautiful women  
Gonna find me one  
To show me how to ride the ultimate wave  

Well East coast girls are hip  
I really dig those styles they wear  
And the Southern girls with the way they talk  
They knock me out when I'm down there  
  
The Mid-West farmer's daughters really make you feel alright  
And the Northern girls with the way they kiss  
They keep their boyfriends warm at night  
  
I wish they all could be California  
I wish they all could be California  
I wish they all could be California girls  
  
The West coast has the sunshine  
And the girls all get so tanned  
I dig a french bikini on Hawaii island  
Dolls by a palm tree in the sand  
  
I been all around this great big world  
And I seen all kinds of girls  
Yeah, but I couldn't wait to get back in the states  
Back to the cutest girls in the world

Catch a wave and you're sitting  
On top of the world  
  
Don't be afraid to try the greatest sport around  
Everybody tries it once  
Those who don't just have to put it down  
You paddle out turn around and raise  
And baby that's all there is  
To the coastline craze  
You gotta catch a wave and you're sittin'  
On top of the world  
  
Not just a fad cause it's been going on so long  
All the surfers going strong  
They said it wouldn't last too long  
They'll eat their words with a fork and spoon  
And watch 'em they'll hit the road  
And all be surfin' soon  
And when they catch a wave they'll be  
Sittin' on top of the world  
  
Catch a wave and your sittin' on top of the world  
  
So take a lesson from a top-notch surfer boy  
Get yourself a big board  
But don't you treat it like a toy  
Just get away from the shady turf  
And baby go catch some rays on the sunny surf  
And when you catch a wave you'll be sittin  
On top of the world  
  
Catch a wave and you'll be sittin'  
On top of the world  
Catch a wave and you'll be sittin'  
On top of the world  
Catch a wave and you'll be sittin'  
On top of the world

A child of winter  
A child of the snow  
I'm making a snowball  
That someone will throw  
I'm making a snowman  
With charcoal for the eyes  
A scarf draped in red  
And a derby on his head  
  
Here comes santa claus, here comes santa claus  
Right down santa claus lane  
Vixen and blitzen and all his reindeer are pulling on the reins  
Bells are ringing, children singing  
All is merry and bright  
Hang your stockings and say your prayers  
'cause santa claus comes tonight  
  
The evening of christmas  
Presents have been passed  
The wood in the fireplace  
Is glowing its last  
I'm closing my eyes now  
In my bed I'm snuggling  
Outside my window  
The carolers sing  
  
Christmas comes and the snow covers all  
Trees are decorated with tinsel and lights  
Mama's in the kitchen making cookies and bread  
The children are hungry, they're waiting to be fed  
  
A child of christmas  
A child of snow  
A wonderful feeling  
Underneath the mistletoe  
And may your christmas  
Last all year  
With laughter of children  
Peace and cheer  
  
A child of christmas  
A child of snow  
A wonderful feeling  
Underneath the mistletoe  
Merry christmas to you  
Ding dong ding go the bells  
Ding dong ding go the bells  
Ding dong ding go the bells  
Ding dong ding go the bells  
Ding dong ding go the bells

Cindy, oh Cindy  
Cindy don't let me down  
Write me a letter soon  
And I'll be homeward bound  
  
I joined the Navy to see the world  
But nowhere could I find  
A girl as sweet as Cindy  
The girl I left behind  
I've searched the wide world over  
Can't get her out of my mind  
  
Cindy, oh Cindy  
Cindy don't let me down  
Write me a letter soon  
And I'll be homeward bound  
  
I see her face in every wave  
Her lips kiss every breeze  
Her loving arms reach out to me  
Through calm and stormy sea  
At night I face the lonely day  
Caressed by memories  
  
Cindy, oh Cindy  
Cindy don't let me down  
Write me a letter soon  
And I'll be homeward bound  
  
I know my Cindy's waiting for me  
As I walk the decks alone  
Her loving arms reach out to me  
Soon I'll be heading home  
Then my sailing days will be over  
No more will I roam  
  
Cindy, oh Cindy  
Girl, oh don't you let me down  
Write me a letter, soon  
And I'll be homeward bound  
  
Oh, homeward bound,  
Well, just to see my Cindy, oh Cindy, Cindy, oh Cindy (fade)

In them old cotton fields back home  
It was back in Louisiana  
Just about a mile from Texarkana  
In them old cotton fields back home  
  
Let me tell you now well got me in a fix

Came upon a nice old man well he had a hat on  
Wait a minute mister can you give me some directions

A summer's day out in California  
It's gonna be those cotton fields back home  
  
It was back in Louisiana  
Just about a mile from Texarkana  
Give me them cotton fields

Let me hear it for the cotton fields  
(just about a mile from Texarkana)  
You know that there's just no place like home  
  
Well boy it sure feels good to breathe the air back home  
You shoulda seen their faces when they seen how I grown  
In them old cotton fields back home

This time each year in our hometown  
The county fair comes our way  
Where the folks gather round to be happy and spend their day  
A-here's what happened now,  
I soon decide that I'd take with me  
The most specialist girl I knew  
I had her pack us a lunch and on down the dirt road we flew  
  
(Hurry hurry, step right up and win your girl a stuffed koala bear)  
[Aw, come on Nicky. Win me a koala bear]  
(Break the balloon with a dart)  
(Yes you son, come up here. Win your girl a stuffed koala bear)  
[Oh please win me a koala bear]  
(Break the balloon with a dart. Come on son, step right up)  
(Get up there, that's a boy)  
  
Right then I knew what I had to do  
(Hurry, hurry)  
Before that day was through  
(Step right up)  
I had to win a stuffed doggie or I'd break her poor heart in two  
(Hurry, hurry)  
(Win a prize)  
A let me tell you now,  
I passed up a chance when I walked by a booth  
(Hurry, hurry)  
Where you throw a dart and break a balloon  
(Step right up)  
I snuck by a couple more, but I had to get caught real soon  
(Hurry, hurry)  
(Win a prize)  
  
(Step right up, test your strength.)  
(Come on son, ring the bell with the hammer)  
[Aww, come on muscles]  
(Win your girl a stuffed koala bear)  
[Ooohhh]  
(Come on son, are you a man or a weakling?)  
(Yes you, step up here and test your strength)  
(Win your girl a stuffed koala bear)  
[Come on baby]  
(Come on son)  
  
I hit the rubber stump just as hard as I could  
(Hurry, hurry)  
But I didn't make it ring the bell  
(Step right up)  
I tried again and again, but I just didn't do so well  
(Hurry, hurry)  
(Win a prize)  
Can you believe it now,  
Up walked a fella and he tapped me on the shoulder, said  
(Hurry, hurry)  
I can win your girl a prize  
(Step right up)  
So, he flexed all his muscles and knocked the bell up in the sky  
(Hurry, hurry)  
(Win a prize)  
  
Yeah the big strong guy knocked the bell in the sky  
(Hurry, hurry)  
Took my girl and the doggie away  
(Step right up...)  
Yeah the big strong guy knocked the bell in the sky  
(Step right up son, test your strength)  
Took my girl and the doggie away  
(Come on kid, ring the bell)  
Yeah the big strong guy knocked the bell in the sky  
[Ah, goodbye muscles. I don't need you anymore]  
Took my girl and the doggie away  
[Loser]

Forgave that doggone cuckoo  
  
I went back to her side  
(Tick-tock  
Tick-tock)  
I had to swallow my pride  
(Tick-tock  
Tick-tock)  
The fire had almost died away  
(Tick-tock

He'll never bother us again  
(Tick-tock

We just forgot about him

Bring back  
Won't you bring back  
Bring back my baby  
  
Daybreak over the ocean  
Moonlight still on the sea  
Will the waves' gentle motion  
Bring my babe, my baby back to me  
  
And the stardust sprinkles the morning  
Venus fades from my side  
Will my love be returning  
Like the sun to brighten up my life  
  
And as day breaks over the ocean  
Moonlight still on the sea  
I pray the waves' gentle motion  
Will bring my baby to me  
  
Bring back  
Won't you bring back  
Bring back  
Bring my baby back  
Bring back  
Won't you bring back  
Bring back my baby  
  
Darlin' if you could only  
Hear this song in my heart  
Then you know why you need never feel lonely  
We'll soon be together, never to depart  
And as long as there is an ocean  
Long as stars are to shine  
Baby you will always have my devotion  
I'll love you pretty baby  
Till the end of time  
  
And as day breaks over the ocean  
Moonlight still on the sea  
I pray the waves' gentle motion  
Will bring my baby to me  
  
And as day breaks over the ocean  
Moonlight still on the sea  
I pray the waves' gentle motion  
Will bring my baby to me  
  
Darlin' if you should ever  
Wonder what you should do  
Baby you should know I'll love you forever  
Maybe little darlin'  
That will see you through  
  
And as the sun sets over the ocean (over the ocean)  
And the world fades from view  
Baby always know our love and devotion  
Will brighten up the night  
We will make it through  
Because I love you  
  
Bring back  
Won't you bring back  
Bring back  
Bring my baby back  
Bring back  
Won't you bring back  
Bring back my baby  
Please my baby  
  
Bring back  
Won't you bring back  
Bring back  
Bring my baby back

Won't you bring back  
Bring back my baby  
Please my baby

It's automatic when I  
Talk with old friends  
The conversation turns to  
Girls we knew when their  
Hair was soft and long and the  
Beach was the place to go  
  
Suntanned bodies and  
Waves of sunshine the  
California girls and a  
Beautiful coastline  
Warmed up weather  
Let's get together and  
Do it again  
  
With a girl the lonely sea looks good  
Makes your night times warm and out of sight  
  
Been so long  
(Hey now hey now hey now hey now hey now)  
(Hey now hey now hey now hey now hey now)  
  
Well I've been thinking 'bout  
All the places we've surfed and danced and  
All the faces we've missed so let's get  
Back together and do it again  
  
Ow!

Rock, rock and roll  
Plymouth rock, roll over  
Rock, rock and roll  
Plymouth rock, roll over  
Bicycle rider, see see what you've done,  
To the church of the American Indian ...  
Rock, rock and roll

Little Richard sang it and Dick Clark brought it to life  
Danny And The Juniors hit a groove, stuck as sharp as a knife  
Well now do you remember all the guys that gave us rock and roll  
  
Chuck Berry's gotta be the greatest thing that's come along  
(hum diddy waddy, hum diddy wadda)  
He made the guitar beats and wrote the all-time greatest song  
(hum diddy waddy, hum diddy wadda)  
Well now do you remember all the guys that gave us rock and roll  
(hum diddy waddy doo)  
  
Elvis Presley is the king  
He's the giant of the day  
Paved the way for the rock and roll stars  
Yeah the critics kept a knockin'  
But the stars kept a rockin'  
And the choppin didn't get very far  
  
Goodness gracious great balls of fire  
Nothin's really movin till the saxophone's ready to blow  
(do you remember, do you remember)  
And the beat's not jumpin' till the drummer says he's ready to go  
(do you remember, do you remember)  
Well now do you remember all the guys that gave us rock and roll  
(do you remember)  
  
Let's hear the high voice wail (oooooooooo)  
And hear the voice down low (wah-ah ah-ah)  
Let's hear the background  
Um diddy wadda, um diddy wadda  
Um diddy wadda, um diddy wadda  
They gave us rock and roll  
Um diddy wadda, um diddy wadda  
They gave us rock and roll  
Um diddy wadda, um diddy wadda  
They gave us rock and roll

Well its been building up inside of me  
For oh I don't know how long  
I don't know why  
But I keep thinking  
Something's bound to go wrong  
  
But she looks in my eyes  
And makes me realize  
And she says "Don't worry baby"  
Don't worry baby  
Don't worry baby  
Everything will turn out alright  
  
Don't worry baby  
Don't worry baby  
Don't worry baby  
  
I guess I should've kept my mouth shut  
When I started to brag about my car  
But I can't back down now because  
I pushed the other guys too far  
  
She makes me come alive  
And makes me want to drive  
When she says "Don't worry baby"  
Don't worry baby  
Don't worry baby  
Everything will turn out alright  
  
Don't worry baby  
Don't worry baby  
Don't worry baby  
  
She told me "Baby, when you race today  
Just take along my love with you  
And if you knew how much I loved you  
Baby nothing could go wrong with you"  
  
Oh what she does to me  
When she makes love to me  
And she says "Don't worry baby"  
Don't worry baby  
Don't worry baby  
Everything will turn out alright  
  
Don't worry baby  
Don't worry baby  
Don't worry baby

Every time I have a date there's only one place to go  
That's to the drive in  
It's such a groovy place to talk and maybe watch a show  
Down at the drive in  
  
Forget about the plot, it'll do very well  
But make sure you see enough so you're prepared to tell  
About the drive in  
I love the drive in  
(we love the drive in, we love the drive in)  
  
If the windows get fogged you'll have to take a breath  
Down at the drive in  
Or the cat dressed in white will scare you both to death  
Down at the drive in  
  
A big buttered popcorn and an extra large coke  
A few chili dogs and man I'm goin' broke  
Down at the drive in  
Yeah at the drive in  
(we love the drive in, we love the drive in)  
  
Don't sneak your buddies in the trunk 'cause they might get caught  
By the drive in  
And they'd look kinda stupid gettin' chased through the lot  
Around the drive in  
  
If you say you watch the movie you're a couple o' liars  
And "remember only you can prevent forest fires"  
Down at the drive in  
  
I love the drive in  
(we love the drive in, we love the drive in)  
Down at the drive in  
  
I love the drive in  
(we love the drive in, we love the drive in)  
Down at the drive in  
  
I love the drive in  
(we love the drive in, we love the drive in)

Unfolding enveloping missiles of soul  
Recall senses sadly  
Mirage like soft blue like lanterns below  
To light the way gladly  
Whether whistling heaven's clouds disappear  
Where the wind withers memory  
Whether whiteness whisks soft shadows away  
Feel flows (White hot glistening shadowy flows)  
Feel goes (Black hot glistening shadowy flows)  
Unbending never ending tablets of time  
Record all the yearning  
Unfearing all appearing message divine  
Eases the burning  
Whether willing witness waits at my mind  
Whether hope dampens memory  
Whether wondrous will stands tall at my side  
Feel flows (White hot glistening shadowy flows)  
Feel goes (Black hot glistening shadowy flows)  
Encasing all embracing wreath of repose  
Engulfs all the senses  
Imposing, unclosing thoughts that compose  
Retire the fences  
Whether wholly heartened life fades away  
Whether harps heal the memory  
Whether wholly heartened life fades away  
Whether wondrous will stands tall at my side  
Whether whiteness whisks soft shadows away  
Feel goes (White hot glistening shadowy flows)  
Feel flows (Black hot glistening shadowy flows)  
Feel goes (White hot glistening shadowy flows)  
Feelings to grow (White hot glistening shadowy flows)  
White hot glistening shadowy flows  
White hot glistening shadowy flows  
White hot glistening shadowy flows  

I kicked out of the surf  
And stuck my board in the sand  
And then up in my Woody  
To a hamburger stand  
And when I got back  
My nine five board was gone  
  
She said yeah she said  
(Finders keepers)  
Finders keepers  
(Losers weepers)  
Losers weepers  
(Finders keepers)  
Finders keepers  
Finders keepers  
Losers weepers  
  
I saw a Hodaddy  
Paddlin' out by the pier  
Well he musta got my board  
'Cause mine isn't here  
But I know how to fix him  
I'll just raise that meatball flag  
  
He said yeah he said  
(Finders keepers)  
Finders keepers  
(Losers weepers)  
Losers weepers  
(Finders keepers)  
Finders keepers  
Finders keepers  
Losers weepers  
  
He took off on a swell  
When he saw the flag  
He's just a crazy Hodaddy  
Pullin' some kind of gag  
He went over the falls  
And now my board's  
Coming back to me  
  
I said yes I said  
(Finders keepers)  
Finders keepers  
(Losers weepers)  
Losers weepers  
(Finders keepers)  
Finders keepers  
Finders keepers  
Losers weepers  
  
(That'll teach him to mess with my board  
Next pass next time...)

If every word I said  
Could make you laugh  
I'd talk forever (together my love)  
I ask the sky just what we had  
Mmm It shone forever (together my love my my my my my my my my my my my

If the song I sing to you  
Could fill your heart with joy  
I'd sing forever (together my love my my my my)

I've been so happy loving you  
  
Do do do do do do do do do together my love

We've been friends now for so many years  
We've been together through the good times and the tears  
Turned each other on to the good things that life has to give  
  
We drift apart for a little bit of a spell  
One night i get a call and i know that you're well  
And days i was down you would help me get out of my hole  
  
Ohh  
Let's be friends  
Let's be friends  
Let's be friends  
  
You told me when my girl was untrue  
I loaned you money when the funds weren't too cool  
I talked your folks out of making you cut off your hair  
  
We've been friends now for so many years  
We've been together through the good times and the tears  
Dim dipple ee dim dipple ay dim dipple oo dim dee aye oh

Full sail full sail  
Steady as you go  
The wind will blow  
Set sail at Frisco Bay  
In a fog cold and gray  
Clear sailing, day after day  
Full sail full sail  
Now the air is still  
We lay adrift  
Come upon a sea of trouble  
Till the winds of change shift  
My course is set  
There's no turning back  
But there's no goin' anywhere yet  
Full sail full sail  
Waiting for the wind to blow  
The wind will blow  
Does the silence of the sea  
Sound warning of a storm ahead  
Whispers of the breeze  
Stir and disappear  
To soft to hear  
What's in store for me  
Adventure on the high seas  
Put the childhood dream to the test  
Find the measure of the man  
Follow the sun heading west  
Full sail  
Steady as you go  
Steady as you go  
Full sail  
Waiting for the wind to blow  
The wind will blow  
Hey full sail  
Mmmm mmmmm  
Hey full sail  

Well she got her daddy's car  
And she cruised to the hamburger stand now  
Seems she forgot all about the library  
Like she told her old man now  
And with the radio blasting  
Goes cruising just as fast as she can now  
  
And she'll have fun, fun, fun  
Till her daddy takes the t-bird away  
(Fun, fun, fun till her daddy takes the t-bird away)  
  
Well the girls can't stand her  
'Cause she walks, looks, and drives like an ace now  
(You walk like an ace now, you walk like an ace)  
She makes the Indy 500 look like a Roman chariot race now  
(You look like an ace now, you look like an ace)  
A lotta guys try to catch her  
But she leads them on a wild goose chase now  
(You drive like an ace now, you drive like an ace)  
  
And she'll have fun, fun, fun  
Till her daddy takes the t-bird away  
(Fun, fun, fun till her daddy takes the t-bird away)  
  
Well you knew all along  
That your dad was gettin' wise to you now  
(You shouldn't have lied now, you shouldn't have lied)  
And since he took your set of keys  
You've been thinking that your fun is all through now  
(You shouldn't have lied now, you shouldn't have lied)  
  
But you can come along with me  
'Cause we gotta a lot of things to do now  
(You shouldn't have lied now, you shouldn't have lied)  
  
And we'll have fun, fun, fun now that daddy took the t-bird away  
(Fun, fun, fun now that daddy took the t-bird away)  
And we'll have fun, fun, fun now that daddy took the t-bird away  
(Fun, fun, fun now that daddy took the t-bird away)  
(Fun, fun now that daddy took the t-bird away)  
(Fun, fun now that daddy took the t-bird away)  
(Fun, fun now that daddy took the t-bird away)  
(Fun, fun now that daddy took the t-bird away)  
(Fun, fun now that daddy took the t-bird away)  
(Fun, fun now that daddy took the t-bird away)

I just looked to see the sun outside  
  
It's shining so bright  
  
A sun the clouds can't hide  
  
Do you remember the time that you hear me say  
  
  
  
I like to play games that two can play

And that's the time when I'm a mister bussinessman  
  
Later on I really get to goin' yeah  
  
I get my motor runnin'

It's just no good unless two can play  
  
Ah ha haaaa  
  
  
  
I was layin' on my back  
  
Relaxin' in the night  
  
I played my radio  
  
It was out of sight  
  
Joe South was singing  
  
"Games People Play"  
  
  
  
And I like to play games that two can play  
  
Ah ha ha ha haaa

The other night they were playing our song  
Hadn't heard it for oh so long  
Took me back darlin' to that time in my car  
When you cried all night cause we'd gone too far  
  
Can I ever getcha back  
Getcha back baby  
Gonna getcha back getcha back  
Getcha back getcha back baby  
Gonna getcha back getcha back  
Can I ever getcha back  
  
I'm getting tired laying around here at night  
Thinkin' 'bout some other guy holding you tight  
He may have money and a brand new car  
May even treat you like a movie star  
And no matter what he ever do for you  
He can never love you like I can do  
So if I leave her and you leave him  
  
Can we ever get it back again  
Getcha back getcha back baby  
Gonna getcha back getcha back  
Getcha back getcha back baby  
Gonna getcha back getcha back

(Getcha back) and you leave him

I may not always love you  
But as long as there are stars above you  
You never need to doubt it  
I'll make you so sure about it  
  
God only knows what I'd be without you  
If you should ever leave me  
Though life would still go on believe me  
The world could show nothing to me  
So what good would living do me  
  
God only knows what I'd be without you  
(God only knows what I'd be without you)  
If you should ever leave me well life would still go on believe me

Had to phone ya' just to tell ya' I was missing you  
It lifts my spirits every single time  
Sometimes you're busy for awhile  
But when you get through  
It makes me smile  
A-when I phone ya'  
California's not so far away  
You're not alone ya' know I'm only just a dial away  
I visualize that you're looking fine  
Feels so good when you come on the line

Every time  
We have a fight  
We flip a coin  
To see who's right  
  
Why do we have to gamble just to see who's right?  
Why can't we arbitrarily resolve a fight?  
But with you're style of gamblin' there's no chance to win  
That's how it is, and that's the way it's always been  
  
Heads, you win  
Tails, I lose  
Heads, you win  
Tails, I lose  
Bad news  
  
If we were playing cards you'd be the one to deal  
You'd play with loaded dice and fix the roulette wheel  
You pick 'em at the races like I've never seen  
And then you make me pay off like a slot machine  
  
Heads, you win  
Tails, I lose  
Heads, you win  
Tails, I lose  
Bad news  
  
Oh well, match me honey (match me honey)  
Take my money (take my money)  
You know the odds are your's (flip it baby)  
So flip the coin  
  
I'm gonna make some changes with this gamblin' game  
From now on I'm the dealer and I'll do the same  
I'll load my dice and stack the deck and fix the odds again  
So if you want to flip to see who's right I know I'll win  
  
Heads, I win  
Tails, you lose  
Heads, I win  
Tails, you lose  
Bad news  
  
Oh well, match me honey (match me honey)  
Take my money (take my money)  
You know the odds are your's (flip it baby)

Stark naked in front of my mirror  
A pudgy person somehow did appear  
Seems lately all I've eaten sugar and fat  
It's getting obvious that's not where it's at  
A big pot and tripley chin  
Oh what condition my condition was in  
Laughing at myself at what a crying shame  
What ever happened to my Greek godly frame  
Cyclamates juicy steaks, sweet things too  
Aren't always good as they seem  
Doughy lumps, stomach pumps, enemas too  
That's what you get when you eat that way  
I read a book on organic foods  
Jumped on a health food kick  
Put me in the mood  
You may not get to perfect overnight  
But on the way you're feelin' clean out of sight  
We ate tonight at Fairfax and 3rd  
We're gonna spread the news and give you the word  
We hope that soon you'll eat like we did today  
We're mighty thankful now that H.E.L.P.'s on its way  
Salad with a special knock you right off your seat  
With carrot juice to wash it all down  
Yummy carob cookies are an organic treat  
And H.E.L.P. has got the best food in town  
H.-E.-L.-P.  
H.E.L.P. your education creates much benefit and peace  
Hamburgers and hot dogs throw 'em all out  
You'll feel so good you'll jump up and shout  
If you haven't why don't you go shopping today  
And 'member now that H.E.L.P. 's on its way  
H.-E.-L.-P.  
Radiant Radish  

My heart was breakin'  
Till you started making me  
Feel like a natural man  
My mind was mess  
Until you brought happiness  
And that's not hard to understand  
When I'm through workin'  
Just fussin' and cussin'  
I'll be there just as quick as I can  
Here comes the night  
Hold me squeeze me don't ever leave me  
Tell me I'm doin' alright  
Hold me squeeze me don't ever leave me  
Tell me I'm doin' alright  
Hold me love me ooooo  
I know livin' is takin' and givin'  
Baby I'm givin' you my best  
One of these days you know  
I'm gonna go crazy  
In the middle of your caress  
When the day goes down  
Honey I'll be around  
Why don't you wear your pretty red dress  
Here comes the night  
Hold me squeeze me don't ever leave me  
Tell me I'm doin' alright  
Hold me squeeze me don't ever leave me  
Tell me I'm doin' alright  
Hold me love me ooooo  
Every mornin' our love is reborn  
And it lives with me all day long  
Things start changin'  
Take as a little rearrangin'  
But our love grows on and on  
Stars who shine in love  
Are making you mine to love  
I've never felt a love so strong  
Here comes the night  
Hold me squeeze me don't ever leave me  
Tell me I'm doin' alright  
Hold me squeeze me don't ever leave me  
Tell me I'm doin' alright  
Hold me love me ooooo

I love to pick you up  
'Cause you're still a baby to me  
Cribs and cradles and bottles and toys  
Are part of the joys they bring  
I wanna wash your face  
And change your clothes and button your shoes  
Walk you around and wrestle with you  
Then I'm gonna make you sing  
In the mornin' I could wake you up  
Feed you breakfast from a little cup  
I want to pick you up  
Rock you back and forth and make you smile  
I want to hold you close for a while  
I wanna tickle your feet  
Drop you in your little tub  
Wash your body and shampoo your hair  
Be careful not to sting your eyes  
When it's night I'll put you in your bed  
And I'll bend and kiss ya on your head  
I want to pick you up  
Rock you back and forth and make you smile  
I want to hold you close for a while  
Pat pat pat pat pat her on her butt butt  
She's going to sleep be quiet  
Pat pat pat pat pat her on her butt  
She's going to sleep  
Little baby go to sleep  

I'm blessed with everything  
A world to which a man can cling  
So happy times when I break out in tears  
In the back of my mind I still have my fears  
  
I live my life with her  
Love her true she knows I'm sure  
I make her happy just living so plain  
In the back of my mind I'm 'fraid it's gonna change  
  
I tried to run far way from thoughts  
I should try to keep away  
But they just keep coming back to me  
I tried to rationalize  
But some day I might realize  
That things are just good the way they'll be  
I know it's so hard to find  
A girl who really understands your mind  
What will I do if I leave her  
It will always be way in the back of my mind

In the still of the night  
I held you, held you tight  
Cause I love, love you so  
Promise I'll never let you go  
In the still of the night  
  
I remember that night in May  
The stars were bright above  
I'll hope and I'll pray  
To keep your precious love  
Well before the light  
Hold me again with all of your might  
In the still of the night  
  
So before the light  
Hold me again with all of your might  
In the still of the night  
(In the still of the night)  
In the still of the night

Ray oh ah ha  
Ray oh ah ha  
Radio ah ha  
You know  
Ray oh ah ha  
Radio ah  
I'm gonna make her mine  
Bom bom bom ba ba bom bom bom bom  
  
I went to trinidad I didn't  
Know just what I had 'til I  
Found her  
  
She wears a pretty smile  
That compliments her shapely  
Style and I found her  
  
Island girl she's oh so pretty  
Island girl I like her plenty  
Island girl I'm gonna make her mine  
  
Island girl she makes me happy  
Island girl she kinda sassy  
Island girl I'm gonna make her mine  
  
Everybody's got an island fantasy  
For me it's like a caribbean odyssey  
All the people live and love there by the sea  
Near the sparkling wather 'neath the coco-palm tree  
  
Island girl she make me happy  
Island girl she kinda sassy  
Island girl won't you show me the way  
  
She's fine so fine all mine  
She's so good to me  
And I know (i know) our love (or love) so free (so free)  
That it was meant to be  
  
Island girl she make me happy  
Island girl she kinda sassy  
Island girl won't you show me the way  
  
She's a real beauty from the caribbean  
Long dark hair flowin' in the breeze  
She's the kinda beauty makes you come alive and  
We can live together for eternity  
  
Every now and then I get this silly grin  
When I'm there in her company  
She says I'm crazy that I'm also very lazy  
I know she loves me  
  
Island girl she make me happy  
Island girl she kinda sassy  
Island girl won't you show me the way  
Island girl won't you show me the way  
Island girl won't you show me the way

After it's all been said  
The music spinning in our head  
Can't forget the feeling of  
The magic of that summer love  
Ooh I wanna take you there  
Do you wanna turn back the pages  
Memories in photographs  
The world is changed  
And yet the game is still the same  
  
Isn't it time we danced the night away  
How about doing it just like yesterday?  
Every time I think of you  
All of those things we used to do  
  
Remember those nights we spent  
Little did we know how the time would fly  
Isn't it time, oh, oh  
Isn't it time, oh, oh  
  
The good times never have to end  
Now's the time to let them happen again  
We can have ourselves a blast  
Good times that aren't only in the past  
  
Isn't it time we danced the night away  
How about doing it just like yesterday?  
Every time I think of you  
All of those things we used to do  
  
Remember those nights we spent  
Little did we know how the time would fly  
Isn't it time, oh, oh  
Isn't it time, oh, oh  
  
And as the sun goes down we raise a glass to kindness  
To all the good times we share  
Isn't it time we get ready again  
Isn't it time we go steady again?  
  
Isn't it time we danced the night away  
How about doing it just like yesterday?  
Every time I think of you  
And all of those things we used to do  
  
Remember those nights we spent  
Little did we know how the time would fly  
Isn't it time, oh, oh  
Isn't it time, oh, oh  
  
Isn't it time we danced the night away  
How about doing it just like yesterday?  
Every time I think of you  
And all of those things we used to do  
  
Remember those nights we spent  
Little did we know how the time would fly  
Isn't it time, oh, oh  
Isn't it time, oh, oh

It's gettin' late  
I can't wait  
Come-a-come-a little closer  
You gotta tell me that you'll stay  
  
I've been praying for this moment  
Since the second I laid eyes on you  
Minutes seem like hours  
When you're gone  
Girl I'm gettin' tired of waitin'  
So stop your hesitatin'  
I can't believe you keep me hangin' on  
  
It's gettin late-ate-ate-ate  
Ooo (it's gettin' late) time waits for no one  
Love is a turn on  
  
It's gettin' late  
I can't wait  
Come-a-come-a little closer  
You gotta tell me that you'll stay  
  
You got me in a situation  
My love is risin' high  
Don't let any more love pass us by  
  
Girl, we can make it up to paradise  
Just give it a try  
So hurry now and girl make up your mind  
  
It's gettin' late  
Don't know how much more I can stand  
It's gettin' late  
Don't know how much more I can stand  
  
Girl I need your lovin'  
I'm so tired of waitin'  
Come on there's no one else around  
  
Ooo sweet girl it's gettin' late  
So please don't hesitate  
Been waitin' to get your defenses down

Fun is in, it's no sin, it's that time again  
To shed your load, hit the road on the run again  
Summer skies in our eyes and a warmer sun  
It's one for all, all for one, all for all out fun  
  
Gotta go to it  
Gonna go through it  
Gotta get with it  
  
Lookin' good  
Down the hood Of a funky ride  
On the way  
To the tide  
Just to tan your hide  
In the shade  
Lemonade  
In the sun ocean spray  
To get your face  
In the race  
Or lay back's no disgrace  
  
Gotta go to it  
Gonna go through it  
Gotta get with it  
  
It's OK to get out there and  
Have some fun  
By yourself maybe  
Or else with a special one.  
Good or bad  
Glad or sad  
It's all gonna pass  
So it's OK  
Let's all play  
And enjoy it while it lasts  
  
Gotta go to it  
Gonna go through it  
Gotta get with it  
  
Find a ride

The flame of love we had has finally died  
Can't take this emptiness it left inside  
It's over now  
  
And though I played the role I lost my soul  
It's still within your heart  
It's over now  
It's over now  
Shades of blue and purple haunt me  
  
The noise outside my window carries on  
Like distant bugles love is very gone  
It's over now  
  
It took a part of me, the heart of me  
To watch it fade away  
It's over now  
It's over now  
Shades of blue and purple haunt me  
  
Heaven  
Heaven is far away  
Angels no longer play  
  
I need to take this fear and force it down  
And just pretend that you are not around  
It's over now  
  
I'll put a Frank Sinatra album on  
And cry my blues away  
It's over now  
It's over now  
Shades of blue and purple haunt me

He came from Louisiana, close to New Orleans  
Way back up in the woods up near the evergreens  
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood  
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode  
He never ever learned to read or write so well  
But he could play the guitar just like a ringing a bell  
Go go  
Go Johnny go go  
Go Johnny go go  
Go Johnny go go  
Go Johnny go go  
Johnny B. Goode  
He used to carry his guitar in a gunney sack  
And sit beneath the trees by the railroad tracks  
Engineers would see him sittin' in the shade  
Strummin' to the rhythm that the drivers made  
And people passing by would stop and say  
My my but that little country boy can play  
Go go  
Go Johnny go go  
Go Johnny go go  
Go Johnny go go  
Go Johnny go go  
Johnny B. Goode  

He sits behind his microphone  
John-ny Car-son  
He speaks in such a manly tone  
John-ny Car-son  
Ed McMahon comes on and says "Here's Johnny"  
Every night at eleven thirty he's so funny  
It's (nice) to (have) you (on) the (show) tonight  
I've seen (your) act (in) Vegas out of sight  
When guests are boring he fills up the slack  
John-ny Car-son  
The network makes him break his back  
John-ny Car-son  
Ed McMahon comes on and says "Here's Johnny"  
Every night at eleven thirty he's so funny  
Don't (you) think (he's) such (a) natural guy  
The (way) he's (kept) it (up) could make you cry  
Who's a man that we admire?  
Johnny Carson is a real live wire.  
Who's a man that we admire?  
Johnny Carson is a real live wire.  
Who's a man that we admire?  
Johnny Carson is a real live wire.  
Who's the man that we admire?  
Johnny Carson is a real live wire.  
  

Keep an eye on summer this year  
Keep an eye on summer  
Keep an eye on  
  
We said goodbye last September  
Your words I still can hear  
Keep an eye on summer this ahh haaa ahhhh (summer)

Those things I say in my letters  
You'll find them most sincere  
Keep an eye on summer this year-ear-ear  
  
Soon we'll be graduating  
And we'll be so far apart  
And though you could be dating  
I'm waiting and waiting  
  
And as we look at the future  
Though it be through a tear  
Keep an eye on summer this (year)ahh haaa ahhhh

Ahhh haaaa ahhhh

Aruba, Jamaica, ooh I want to take ya  
Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama  
Key Largo, Montego, baby why don't we go, Jamaica  
  
Off the Florida Keys, there's a place called Kokomo  
That's where you want to go to get away from it all  
Bodies in the sand, tropical drink melting in your hand  
We'll be falling in love to the rhythm of a steel drum band  
Down in Kokomo  
  
[Chorus]  
Aruba, Jamaica, ooh I want to take you to  
Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama  
Key Largo, Montego, baby why don't we go  
Ooh I want to take you down to  
Kokomo, we'll get there fast and then we'll take it slow  
That's where we want to go, way down in Kokomo.  
  
Martinique, that Montserrat mystique  
  
We'll put out to sea and we'll perfect our chemistry  
And by and by we'll defy a little bit of gravity  
Afternoon delight, cocktails and moonlit nights  
That dreamy look in your eye, give me a tropical contact high  
Way down in Kokomo  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Port au Prince, I want to catch a glimpse  
  
Everybody knows a little place like Kokomo  
Now if you want to go and get away from it all  
Go down to Kokomo  
  
[Chorus]  
Aruba, Jamaica, ooh I want to take you to  
Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama  
Key Largo, Montego, baby why don't we go  
Ooh I want to take you down to

Where the sea breeze  
Sways the palm trees  
Paradise awaits  
And so does she  
  
Reliving love  
That was like a romance  
From a page in history  
  
It was the last place  
That he stopped at  
On the way back to his boat  
  
She was dancing  
Met his glancing  
Like they say  
"It was all she wrote"  
  
You know I want to  
But I can't stay (bye bye)  
Girl you know I'm gonna sail away (sail away)  
When the wind comes up  
And when the sun goes down  
I'll say "goodbye" to this Hawaiian town  
  
I don't know what way you pull this shines [???]  
You and Lahaina always on my mind  
  
They left the dance floor  
So they could spend more  
Precious time near the water side  
  
It wasn't wrong  
And it wasn't right  
They were two ships  
Passing in the night  
  
You know I want to  
But I can't stay (bye bye)  
Girl you know I'm gonna sail away (sail away)  
When the wind comes up  
And when the sun goes down  
I'll say "goodbye" to this Hawaiian town  
  
I think about you when the full moon shines  
Lahaina always on my mind  
  
You know I want to  
But I can't stay (bye bye)  
Girl you know I'm gonna sail away (sail away)  
When the wind comes up  
And when the sun goes down  
I'll say "goodbye" to this Hawaiian town  
  
I think about you when the full moon shines  
Lahaina always on my mind  
  
You know I want to  
But I can't stay (bye bye)  
Girl you know I'm gonna sail away (sail away)  
When the wind comes up  
And when the sun goes down  
I'll say "goodbye" to this Hawaiian town  
  
I think about you when the full moon shines  
Lahaina always on my mind

When I watched you walk with him  
Tears filled my eyes  
And when I heard you talk with him  
I couldn't stand his lies  
And now before he tries it  
I hope you realize it girl  
  
(Let him run wild)  
(He don't care baby)  
Let him run  
(Let him run wild)  
(He'll find out baby)  
Let him run  
(Let him run run run run wild baby)  
  
(Guess you know I waited for you girl)  
He'll do the same to other girls  
That he did to you  
Then one day he'll run in to one  
That's gonna hurt him too  
So before he makes you over  
I'm gonna take you over  
  
(Let him run wild)  
(He don't care baby)  
Let him run  
(Let him run wild)  
(He'll find out baby)  
Let him run  
(Let him run run run run wild baby)  
  
(Guess you know I waited for you girl)  
All the dreams you shared with him  
You might as well forget  
I know you need a truer love  
And that's what you'll get  
And now that you don't need him  
Well he can have his freedom  
  
(Let him run wild)  
(He don't care baby)  
Let him run  
(Let him run wild)  
(He'll find out baby)  
Let him run  
(Let him run run run run wild baby)  
Let him run  
(Let him run run run run wild baby)  
Let him run  
(Let him run run run run wild baby)  
Let him run

To get t'you baby I went through the wringer  
Ain't gonna let you slip through my fingers  
Going to school isn't my fondest desire  
But sittin' in class you set my soul on fire  
God please let us go on this way  
All day long I practiced what to say-ay  
I think about this game that I like to play-ay  
When I leave you I'm so depressed  
'Cause you're my only happiness  
God please let us go on this way  
Seems we have extra-sensory perception  
You can send me thoughts I'd have no objection  
Now we can fly high in the sky  
We'll live forever, we'll never die  
God please let us go on this way-ay  
(God please let us go on)  
God please let us go on this way-ay  
(God please let us go on)  
God please let us go on this way-ay  
(God please let us go on)  
God don't let her slip through my fingers  
(God please let us go on)  
God please let us go on this way-ay  

Alright, right now  
Everytime we've been here  
We've asked you to do one thing for us  
And that, that one thing is to help us out  
And yell something  
Alright  
And the thing we want you to yell  
Three words"let's go trippin'"  
We want you to yell out on the count of three ok?  
One, Two, Two-and-a-half, Three  
Let's go trippin'!  
Yeah, baby!  
  
Instrumental  
  
Thank you  
Thank you very much

Little bird up in a tree  
Looked down and sang a song to me  
Of how it began  
  
Na na na na na na  
Na na na na na na  
Na na na na na na  
  
The trout in the shiny brook  
Gave the worm another look  
And told me not to worry  
About my life  
  
Na na na na na na  
Na na na na na na  
Na na na na na na  
  
Tree in my own backyard  
Stands all alone  
Bears fruit for me  
And it tastes so good  
  
Where's my pretty bird  
He must have flown away  
If I keep singing  
He'll come back someday  
  
Dawn, bird's still gone  
Guess I'll go mow the lawn  
  
What a day, what a day  
Oooo, what a beautiful day this is  
  
Ooooooooo  
Little bird up in a tree  
Looked down a sang a song to me  
  
The trout in a shiny brook  
Gave the worm another look  
And told me not to worry about my life  
  
Little bird looked down  
And sang a song to me  
Little bird looked down  
And sang a song to me  
Little bird looked down  
And sang a song to me

Little deuce Coupe  
You don't know what I got  
Little deuce Coupe  
You don't know what I got  
  
Well I'm not braggin' babe so don't put me down  
But I've got the fastest set of wheels in town  
When something comes up to me he don't even try  
Cause if I had a set of wings man I know she could fly  
She's my little deuce coupe  
You don't know what I got  
(My little deuce coupe)  
(You don't know what I got)  
  
Just a little deuce coupe with a flat head mill  
But she'll walk a Thunderbird like (she's) it's standin' still  
She's ported and relieved and she's stroked and bored.  
She'll do a hundred and forty with the top end floored  
She's my little deuce coupe  
You don't know what I got  
(My little deuce coupe)  
(You don't know what I got)  
  
She's got a competition clutch with the four on the floor  
And she purrs like a kitten till the lake pipes roar  
And if that ain't enough to make you flip your lid  
There's one more thing, I got the pink slip daddy  
  
And comin' off the line when the light turns green  
Well she blows 'em outta the water like you never seen  
I get pushed out of shape and it's hard to steer  
When I get rubber in all four gears  
  
She's my little deuce coupe  
You don't know what I got  
(My little deuce coupe)  
(You don't know what I got)  
She's my little deuce coupe  
You don't know what I got  
(My little deuce coupe)  
(You don't know what I got)  
She's my little deuce coupe  
You don't know what I got

Go!  
I'm gonna wake you up early cause I'm gonna take a ride with you.  
We're goin' down to the Honda shop, I'll tell you what we're gonna do.  
Put on a ragged sweatshirt, I'll take you anywhere you want me to.  
  
[Chorus:]  
First gear, it's all right (Honda, Honda, go faster, faster)  
Second gear, I'll lean right (Honda, Honda, go faster, faster)  
Third gear, hang on tight (Honda, Honda, go faster, faster)  
Faster, it's all right.  
  
It's not a big motorcycle,  
Just a groovy little motorbike.  
It's more fun than a barrel of monkeys,  
That two-wheeled bike.  
We'll ride on out of the town  
To anyplace I know you like.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It climbs the hills like a Matchless,  
Cause my Honda' built really light.  
When I go in to the turns  
Better hang on tight.  
I'd better turn on the lights  
So we can ride my Honda tonight.  
  
[Chorus]

Oooooooo  
Merry Christmas Saint Nick  
Christmas comes this time each year  
  
Well way up north where the air gets cold  
There's a tale about Christmas  
That you've all been told  
And a real famous cat all dressed up in red  
All he spends all year workin' out on his sled  
  
It's the little Saint Nick  
Little Saint Nick  
It's the little Saint Nick  
Little Saint Nick  
  
Just a little bobsled we call the old Saint Nick  
But she'll walk a toboggan with a four speed stick  
She's candy apple red with a ski for a wheel  
And when Santa hits the gas man just watch her peel  
  
It's the little Saint Nick  
Little Saint Nick  
It's the little Saint Nick  
Little Saint Nick  
  
Run run reindeer  
Run run reindeer  
Whoaa  
Run run reindeer  
Run run reindeer  
  
He don't miss no one  
  
And haulin' through the snow at a frightening speed  
With a half a dozen deer with Rudy to lead  
He's got to wear his goggles cause the snow really flies  
And he's cruisin' every path with a little surprise  
  
It's the little Saint Nick  
Little Saint Nick  
It's the little Saint Nick  
Little Saint Nick  
  
Oooooooo  
Merry Christmas Saint Nick  
Christmas comes this time each year  
  
Oooooooo  
Merry Christmas Saint Nick  
Christmas comes this time each year  
  
Oooooooo  
Merry Christmas Saint Nick  
Christmas comes this time each year

The lonely sea  
The lonely sea  
It never stops  
For you or me  
It moves along  
From day to day  
  
That's why my love  
That's why my love  
You'll never stay  
You'll never stay  
  
This pain in my heart  
These tears in my eyes  
Please tell the truth  
You're like the lonely sea (sea)  
Sea (sea)  
The lonely sea (sea)  
  
[Repeat: x3]  
(Lonely sea lonely sea)  
(Lonely sea lonely sea)  
Lonely sea

So hard to answer future's riddle  
When ahead is seeming so far behind  
So hard to laugh a child-like giggle  
When the tears start to torture my mind  
So hard to shed the life of before  
To let my soul automatically soar  
But I hit hard at the battle that's confronting me, yeah  
Knock down all the roaddblocks a-stumbling me  
Throw off all the shackles that are binding me down  
Sew up the wounds of evolution  
And the now starts to get in my way  
So what if life's a revelation  
If the mind speaks of only today  
So real, the pain growing in my soul  
Of climbing up to reality's goal  
But I hit hard at the battle that's confronting me, yeah  
Knock down all the roaddblocks a-stumbling me  
Throw off all the shackles that are binding me down  
Long promised road  
Trail starts at dawn  
Carries on to the season's ending  
Long promised road  
Flows to the source, gentle force, never ending, never ending  
So hard to lift the jeweled sceptre  
When the weight turns a smile to a frown  
So hard to drink of passion nectar  
When the taste of life's holding me down  
So hard to plant the seed of reform  
To set my sights on defeating the storm  
So I hit hard at the battle that's confronting me, yeah  
Knock down all the roaddblocks a-stumbling me  
Throw off all the shackles that are binding me down  
Oh, yeah-eah-eah-eah  
Hit hard at the battle that's confronting me, yeah  
Knock down all the roaddblocks a-stumbling me  
Throw off all the shackles that are binding me down  
Oh, yeah-eah-eah-eah  
Hit hard at the battle that's confronting me, yeah  
Knock down all the roaddblocks a-stumbling me  
Throw off all the shackles that are binding me down  
I'd love to see you  
I'd love to see you  
I'd love to see you  
I'd love to see you  
I'd love to see you  

Now that I have lost my Diane  
There's no plan as to where to go  
It was hard to lose my Diane  
Now I just miss her so  
Everything is old and nothing is new  
All I ever do is think of you  
Memories haunt me night and day  
(Ahhhhhhhhhhh)  
Do you think of me, my Diane  
Or have you forgotten me?  
Did you think that you were chained down  
And now that you are free  
Everything is wrong and nothing is right  
I want you back with all of my might  
Shadows hanging over my head  
I love you Diane I miss you Diane  
Everything is wrong and nothing is right  
I want you back with all of my might  
Everything is wrong and nothing is right  
I want you back with all of my might  
Everything is wrong and nothing is right  
I want you back with all of my might  
Everything is wrong and nothing is right  
I want you back with all of my might  

Cease to resist, come on say you love me  
Give up your world, come on and be with me  
I'm your kind, I'm your kind, and I see  
  
Come on come on, ooo I love you pretty girl  
My life is yours, and you can have my world  
I'm your kind, I'm your kind, and I see  
  
Never had a lesson I ever learned  
I know I could never learn not to love you  
Come in now closer  
Come in closer closer closer ahhhh  
  
Submission is a gift given to another  
Love and understanding is for one another  
I'm your kind, I'm your kind, and I see  
  
Never had a lesson I ever learned  
I know I could never learn not to love you  
Come in now closer  
Come in closer come in closer ahhhh  
  
Ahhh-ahhh-ahhh-ahhh-ahhhhhh  
Ahhh-ahhh-ahhh-ahhh-ahhhhhh
