Someone says  
Wake up child,  
And throw your life away.  
See you in the crime file,  
What will your mama say?  
  
Sometimes you get angry,  
No focus in your life.  
When people get hungry,  
They learn how to survive.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Changing every day.  
Changing every day.  
Changing every day.  
Changing every day.  
  
Summer syncopation,  
The space between your eyes.  
Is a place for heroes,  
That never compromise.  
  
Sometimes you feel lonely,  
No focus or surprise.  
Pushed into production,  
What a way to live our lives.  
  
[Chorus]

When I looked in your eyes  
Felt the spirit of man  
Demanding more than just a smile  
Took a chance for a while  
Speaking in tongues  
That float us down rivers  
The past will remind us  
All colours we chose  
When I told you those lies  
Felt the spirit of love  
Demanding more than compromise  
Took a chance for a while  
Speaking in tongues  
That float us down rivers  
The past will remind us  
All colours we chose  
Some people say that the way that we live  
Is out of this place  
And some people say that the way that we live  
Is blinded by fate  
All colours we chose

I was cold till you touched me  
Fear had no place to hide  
I felt nothing but sadness  
Love is the great divide  
  
Felt like someone was counting  
The tears that rush from my eyes  
I was broken and doubting  
Love and my own sweet pride  
  
Come clean, come clean  
You know where you've been  
Slipping and stepping inside  
Come clean, come clean  
I know that's a dream  
Love is the divide  
  
Felt a rush from the mountain  
Oh lord, i pushed you aside  
I felt nothing but sadness  
I'll be alone tonight  
  
How can we lose? there's no laws to abuse  
There was never more passion in crime  
You took my hand, told me you'd understand  
There'd be time, so much time  
  
I was cold till you touched me  
Fear had no place to hide  
I felt nothing but sadness  
Love is the great divide

Death Cab for Cutie  
Sung it like a beauty  
Stepped out forgetting  
Danger has a duty  
Lonely night  
He wants to squeeze her tight  
  
They murder for a dollar  
No-one hears you holler  
Wrap up your baby  
Then you'll be a scholar  
  
[Chorus:]  
Love stops knocking  
Your heart stops rocking  
It's crime time  
Crime time  
  
Out on the mainland  
Hit him with a right hand  
Stepped on his ego  
Now he feels like a man  
Do it right  
It's a lonely fight  
  
Playing Fats Waller  
Lipstick on your collar  
Back in 1950  
People had their honor  
  
[Chorus]  
  
They murder for a dollar  
No-one hears you holler  
Wrap up your baby  
Then you'll be a scholar  
  
[Chorus]

Give me time to realize my crime  
Let me love and steal.  
I have danced inside your eyes  
How can I be real.  
  
Do you really want to hurt me  
Do you really want to make me cry  
Precious kisses words that burn me  
Lovers never ask you why.  
In my heart the fire is burning  
Choose my color find a star  
Precious people always tell me  
That's a step a step too far.  
  
Do you really want to hurt me  
Do you really want to make me cry  
Do you really want to hurt me  
Do you really want to make me cry.  
  
Words are few  
I have spoken  
I could waste a thousand years  
Wrapped in sorrow, words are token  
Come inside and catch my tears  
You've been talking but believe me  
If it's true you do not know  
This boy loves without a reason  
I'm prepared to let you go  
  
If it's love you want from me  
Then take it away  
Everything's not what you see it's over again.  
  
Do you really want to hurt me  
Do you really want to make me cry  
Do you really want to hurt me  
Do you really want to make me cry.  
  
Give me time to realize my crime  
Let me love and steal.  
I have danced inside your eyes  
How can I be real.  
If it's love you want from me then take it again.

I was staring at the people  
Lost and terrified  
Turned and saw you smiling  
My heart was terrorized  
Lust among the millions  
Another suicide  
And when I think that love was there  
  
[Chorus:]  
Don't want to talk about it  
Don't want to talk about it  
The pain we share  
While they just talk about it  
While they just talk about it  
  
A hand reached out to touch me  
A letter hit the pile  
I felt my life revolving  
Like fingers in a dial  
Just then I stopped believing  
But only for a while  
And when I think that love was there  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When I think that love was there  
Don't want to talk about it  
Don't want to talk about it  
Don't give it up  
Don't count on their loving  
Don't give it up, don't try  
Don't give it up  
Don't count on their loving  
Don't give it up, don't try  
  
Don't want to talk about it  
Don't want to talk about it  
And when I think that love was there  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When I think that love was there  
I was staring at the people  
Lost and terrified  
Turned and saw you crying  
A victim of your pride  
But you are no civilian  
So open up your eyes

You sheltered me from harm,  
Kept me warm, kept me warm  
You gave my life to me,  
Set me free, set me free  
The finest years I ever knew,  
Were all the years I had with you  
  
[Chorus]  
I would give anything I own,  
Give up my life, my heart, my home  
I would give anything I own,  
Just to have you back again  
  
You taught me how to laugh,  
What it solved, what it solved  
You never said too much,  
But still you showed the way  
And I knew from watching you  
Nobody else could ever know,  
The part of me that can't let go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Is there someone you know,  
You're loving them so  
But taking them all for granted  
You may lose them one day,  
Someone takes them away  
And they don't hear the words you long to say  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Just to touch you once again

Luxury and heartache  
Oh yeah  
Oh luxury and heartache  
Oh yeah  
  
I won't be coming home tomorrow  
Nobody there to catch my tears  
I won't be leaving tears of sorrow anymore  
I played that game for so many years  
  
If I cry, will you catch my fall  
Do you want me to be the same  
If I cry, will you catch my fall  
Am I playing the loser's game?  
  
From luxury to heartache  
Such a long way to find that you were mourning  
From luxury to heartache  
Such a long way you gave me little warning  
  
She will be there to give you children, yes she will  
She will be there to make you sing, sing, sing  
I won't be standing in the shadows anymore  
I learned to cover up my pain  
  
If I cry will you catch my fall  
Do you want me to be the same  
If I cry will you catch my fall  
Am I playing the loser's game?  
  
From luxury to heartache  
Such a long way to find that you were mourning  
From luxury to heartache  
Such a long way you gave me little warning  
  
Gave me love  
You gave your love to me  
You gave me love  
But it's not enough for me  
  
Oh luxury  
But all you give me is pain  
Again and again  
Luxury is sweet and so cool  
  
If I cry will you catch my fall  
Do you want me to be the same  
If I cry will you catch my fall  
Am I playing the loser's game?  
  
From luxury to heartache  
Such a long way to find that you were mourning  
From luxury to heartache  
Such a long way you gave me little warning  
  
From luxury to heartache  
Such a long way to find that you were mourning  
From luxury to heartache  
Such a long way you gave me, gave me no warning

Baby, baby, we like your lips  
Baby, baby, we like your pants  
All aboard for funtime  
  
Baby, baby, we want in  
We want some, we want some  
All aboard for funtime  
  
Last night I was down in the lab  
Talking to Dracula and his crew  
All aboard for funtime  
  
Oh, I feel lucky tonight  
I wanna get some and run around  
All aboard for a funtime  
  
Baby, baby, we like your lips  
Baby, baby, we like your pants  
All aboard for funtime  
  
Everybody, we want in  
We want some, we want some  
All aboard for funtime

I don't know much  
but I know what I feel  
there's too many people fighting  
tied to the wheel  
I don't know much  
but I know what i see  
there's too many people crying  
washed out to sea  
  
and there's much more we can say  
much more we can do  
much more we can learn  
generations of love  
  
I don't knwo you but you know what I am  
hey I don't need redemption  
or no government plan  
no big AIDS sensation  
no 28 clause  
the end of aparteid  
no message of war  
the jew and the gentile  
the black and the gay  
the lost and the futile  
they've all got something to say  
the african nation  
the sword of Islam  
the rebels in chaina  
the sikhs and the tams  
the house of our father  
the volumes of guilt  
the luck of the Irish  
the blood that we've spilt  
the angels and martyrs  
the lovers and saints  
the sisters of mercy  
the brothers of pain

Woman, thank you thank you  
God thank you woman  
  
What we have is something special  
Something quite unique  
What we have should last forever  
Heaven at my feet  
  
I would give the world to you  
Or anything you need  
There is nothing I won't do  
Just promise that you'll never leave  
  
God thank you woman  
Thank you thank you  
For the joy that you give to me  
God thank you woman  
Thank you thank you  
For the joy that you give to me  
  
In this world you are my pleasure  
No one can compete  
Happiness is hard to measure  
Woman you're so sweet  
  
I would give my heart to you  
You're the air I breathe  
There is nothing I won't do  
Just promise that you'll never leave  
  
God thank you woman  
Thank you thank you  
For the joy that you give to me  
God thank you woman  
Thank you thank you  
For the joy that you give to me  
  
When I'm alone at night I think of love  
Well baby that's alright but it ain't enough  
  
Won't you call me if you need me  
I have loved  
  
I would give the world to you  
Or anything you need  
Oh God thank you woman  
Thank you thank you  
For the joy that you give to me  

United (I get tired of speaking)  
What if you're a lonely boy?  
What if you're broken man?  
What if you're just tired of speaking?  
  
I live with my heartache, you bet that I do  
I'm sad and I'm shaken, I'm empty and so blue  
Magical function, I gave it all to you  
They say they'll never let you down  
  
United we stand so tall  
They say they'll never let you down  
United we fall  
  
What if you're a lonely boy?  
What if you're a broken man?  
What if you're just tired of speaking?  
What if you're alone at night?  
What if we're all heaven's children?  
  
I grew up in darkness, my enemies few  
I gave you my life, it was easy for you  
No explanation, this boy has grown up too  
They say they'll never let you down  
  
United we stand so tall  
They say they'll never let you down  
United we fall  
I believe the world should always be our standing ground  
  
And I believe the world should hold us close  
And spin this great big world around  
Don't be scared at night alone  
And spin this great big world around  
  
What if you're a lonely boy?  
What if you're a broken man?  
What if you're just tired of speaking?  
What if they break hearts for you?  
(And I will never let go)  
What if you're intent is true?  
(No matter how we control)  
What if you're just tired of crying?  
(I will never let go, no matter how we control)  
Heaven's children  
  
I was young, but still I knew  
People were just frightened too  
I would talk, they would not hear me  
  
What if you're a lonely boy?  
What if you're a broken man?  
What if you're just tired of speaking?  
  
I have been a lonely boy  
I have been a broken man  
I am here and still I'm crying

You've got Hiroshima, going cough inside  
You cheat and lie, just to survive  
Shake the money tree, heed the warning signs  
Where lovers lie, not parricides  
What would you give to be the master of your life?  
This struggle is such a waste of time, yours and mine  
I give you these eyes that I see through  
My blood, my money too  
I'm not afraid to run to you 'cause I get lonely too  
No one knows you, like I do  
You've got Hiroshima, inside, where lovers lie  
What would you give to be the master of your life?  
'Cause struggle is such a waste of time, yours and mine  
I give you these eyes that I see through  
My blood, my money too  
I'm not afraid to run to you 'cause I feel lonely too  
No one knows you, like I do  
What would you give to be the master of your life?  
The struggle is such a waste of time, yours and mine  
I give you these eyes that I see through  
My blood, my money too  
I'm not afraid to run to you 'cause I get lonely  
I give you these eyes that I see through  
My blood, my money too  
I'm not afraid to run to you 'cause I get lonely too  
I give you these eyes that I see through  
My blood, my money too  
I'm not afraid to run to you 'cause I get lonely  

Take a picture of tonight and  
Keep it by your heart  
Love has left us memories  
There's no better way to part  
I will find another love  
Someone who won't me down  
How you tried to level me  
But you never stood your ground  
Fortunately I got wise this time  
Fortunately I had me on my mind  
Oh I just want to be loved  
Don't want to fight you baby  
But I'm much too proud to say it loud  
I just want to be loved  
Don't want to beg you baby  
But I'm much too proud to say it loud  
Take a piece of dignity and  
Use it in your life  
Even though you hurt me  
I still want you to survive  
Love was never special  
We were never down  
You will always have someone  
To bring you on the ground  
Fortunately I got wise this time  
Fortunately I had me on my mind  
Oh I just want to be loved  
Don't want to fight you baby  
But I'm much too proud to say it loud  
I just want to be loved  
Don't want to beg you baby  
But I'm much too proud to say it loud  
When you love someone  
Don't you know, love is blind  
When you love someone  
It'll be for all time, yeah that's right  
Fortunately I got wise this time  
Fortunately I had me on my mind  
Oh I just want to be loved  
Don't want to fight you baby  
But I'm much too proud to say it loud  
I just want to be loved  
Don't want to beg you baby  
Love me, love me, love me, love me yeah  

Downtown we'll drown We're in our never splendour.  
Flowers, showers. Who's got the new boy gender?  
I'll be your baby, I'll be your score.  
I'll run the gun for you and so much more.  
  
I'll tumble 4 ya, I'll tumble 4 ya,  
I'll tumble 4 ya, I'll tumble 4 ya,  
I'll tumble 4 ya, I'll tumble 4 ya,  
I'll tumble 4 ya, I'll tumble.  
  
Uptown. Their sound is like the native you send her.  
Junktion, funktion. The boy with pop is slender.  
Did he say maybe? Or I'm not sure?  
He'll be a boy for you but you need more.  
  
I'll tumble 4 ya, I'll tumble 4 ya,  
I'll tumble 4 ya, I'll tumble 4 ya,  
I'll tumble 4 ya, I'll tumble 4 ya,  
I'll tumble 4 ya, I'll tumble.  
  
I get a crazy feeling that chases in my head.  
It's nothing that you do to me,  
It's nothing that you said.  
It's love in stereo  
And when I can't let got I say:  
  
I'll be your baby  
I'll be your score,  
I'll run the gun for you and so much more.  
I'll tumble 4 ya, I'll tumble 4 ya,  
I'll tumble 4 ya, I'll tumble 4 ya,  
I'll tumble 4 ya, I'll tumble 4 ya,  
I'll tumble 4 ya, I'll tumble 4 ya,  
  
Downtown we'll drown We're in our never splendour.  
Flowers, showers. Who's got the new boy gender?

I'll tumble 4 ya, I'll tumble 4 ya,  
I'll tumble 4 ya, I'll tumble 4 ya,

Some days in more ways  
I need the distractions  
Fire, desire, love and reaction  
He must be someone  
Yes even me  
Something for nothing  
Some wish to see  
Life beyond reason  
  
Who will I be (who will I be)  
I'm afraid of me  
I'm afraid of me  
  
Always survive days  
Cut and discretion  
Touched in a sane way  
Leave no impression  
  
He must be someone  
Yes even you  
Fool my direction  
Some wish to see  
Love without treason  
Who will love me (who will love me)  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm afraid of me  
I'm afraid of me  
(Afraid to love you)  
I'm afraid of me  
I'm afraid of me  
  
Some days in more ways  
I need the distractions  
Fire, desire, love and reaction  
He must be someone  
Yes even me  
Something for nothing  
Some wish to see  
Life beyond reason  
  
Who will I be (who will I be)  
Always survive days  
Cut and discretion  
Touched in a sane way  
Leave no impression  
He must be someone  
  
Yes even you  
Fool my direction  
Some wish to see  
Love without treason  
Who will love me (who will love me)  
  
[Chorus]

Is there cream in this soup?  
  
I look in the mirror, I know I'm not good enough to eat  
I'll tell you something, my hunger has nothing to do with greed  
So I bleed  
  
This is junkie love when you've got no sugar  
You behave like a wretch when you could be the Buddha  
You say it's you but I know it's me  
  
Is there cream in this soup, is there truth in this lie?  
A promise that was made in the strangest eye  
Would you kill for love, can you go the mile?  
Baby don't lie  
  
Take the needle off the record, it's been playin' such a long time  
Take the needle off the record, I'm so tired of hearin' that line  
Same old line  
  
I look in the mirror, I know I'm not good enough to eat  
I'll tell you something, my hunger has nothin' to do with greed  
So feed me  
  
This is junkie love when you've got no sugar  
You live like a wretch when you should be the Buddha  
You say it's you but I know it's me  
  
Is there cream in this soup, is there truth in this lie?  
A promise that was made in the strangest eye  
Would you kill for love, would you do or die?  
Baby don't lie  
  
Take the needle off the record, it's been playing such a long time  
Take the needle off the record, I'm so tired of hearing that line  
Take the needle off the record, it's been playing such a long time  
Take the needle off the record, I'm so tired of hearing that line  
  
Lie, lie, lie  
Lie, lie, lie  
Lie, lie, lie  
  
I never meant to hurt you, I don't know why  
You come with your lawyers and your alibi  
How can you look me straight in the eye  
When you know your truth is a lie, lie, lie  
  
Lie, lie  
Lie, lie  
Lie, lie, ohh  
  
Take the needle off the record, it's been playing such a long time  
Take the needle off the record, I'm so tired of hearing that line  
Take the needle off the record, it's been playing such a long time  
Take the needle off the record, I'm so tired of hearing that line, line, line  
  
Spill now, scream now  
  
Take the needle off the record, come on  
Take the needle off the record  
Take the needle off the record

Guns that cross the street  
You never know who you might meet  
Who's in disguise  
Ooh as you blow a storm  
There's no one there to keep you warm  
It's no surprise there's something in my eyes  
  
It's a miracle  
It's a miracle  
It's a miracle  
It's a miracle  
It's a miracle  
It's a miracle  
And dreams are made of emotion  
  
Dance with the counterfeit  
The plastic smiles and micro heat  
I'll meet you there, I'll meet you there  
Run to the edge of town  
Where Hollywood lay its footprints down  
Monroe was there but do you really care  
  
It's a miracle  
It's a miracle  
It's a miracle  
It's a miracle  
It's a miracle  
It's a miracle  
And dreams are made of emotion  
  
Cry it's a miracle  
Cry it's a miracle  
Cry it's a miracle  
Cry it's a miracle  
  
Guns that cross the street  
You never know who you might meet  
Who's in disguise, who's in disguise  
Ooh as you blow a storm  
There's no one there to keep you warm  
It's no surprise there's something in my eyes  
  
It's a miracle  
It's a miracle  
It's a miracle  
It's a miracle  
It's a miracle  
It's a miracle  
And dreams are made of emotion  

Desert loving in your eyes all the way.  
If I listen to your lies,  
Would you say I'm a man without conviction,  
I'm a man who doesn't know  
How to sell a contradiction?  
You come and go, you come and go.  
  
Karma, karma, karma, karma, karma, chameleon,  
You come and go, you come and go.  
Loving would be easy if your colours were like my dreams:  
Red, gold, and green, red, gold, and green.  
  
Didn't you hear your wicked words ever'y day.  
And you used to be so sweet.  
I heard you say that my love was an addiction.  
When we cling, our love is strong.  
When you go, you're gone forever.  
You string along, you string along.  
  
Karma, karma, karma, karma, karma, chameleon,  
You come and go, you come and go.  
Loving would be easy if your colours were like my dreams:  
Red, gold, and green, red, gold, and green.  
  
Ev'ry day is like survival.  
You're my lover, not my rival.  
  
Ev'ry day is like survival.  
You're my lover, not my rival.  
  
I'm a man without conviction  
I'm a man who doesn't know  
How to sale a contradiction?  
You come and go, you come and go.  
  
Karma, karma, karma, karma, karma, chameleon,  
You come and go, you come and go.  
Loving would be easy if your colours were like my dreams:  
Red, gold, and green, red, gold, and green.  
  
Karma, karma, karma, karma, karma, chameleon,  
You come and go, you come and go.  
Loving would be easy if your colours were like my dreams:  
Red, gold, and green, red, gold, and green.

Saved by this parade of passion was my company  
Gave my life for next to nothing a sane artillery  
Is one that kisses 2 be clever, who is the enemy?  
It's not me, not me, not you, not me  
  
Saved by this persuade like passion, sexuality  
Gave my heart like fate was nothing, a sane reality  
Is one that wishes never, never, what is reality  
Show me, show me, show me  
  
Sail on a sea of Pepsi Cola shaken at sunrise  
Kiss the boy and then employ a very white disguise  
Who had asked you to consider, you are not so fly  
In the city they will snigger, ask them why  
  
Saved by this parade of passion was my company  
Gave my life for next to nothing, a sane artillery  
Is one that kisses 2 be clever, who is the enemy?  
It's not me, not me, no, not you, not me  
It's not you, not me, no, not you then who?

Dirty Babylon  
You're nasty  
  
Everyone said you are the don  
Respected, rejected, down trodden and stunned  
Hold up your head like the innocent one  
Threaten my life, tell me my time will come  
  
Babylon boy with the honey and gold  
Robbing the black men, stories of old  
Why tell the truth? I cannot be  
I am the light that you never see  
  
Oh, nothing more than the lion's roar  
Gimme truth and understanding  
Oh, nothing more than the lion's roar  
  
The voice in your head said I am a thief  
You stand on the land and you lie through your teeth  
Babylon boy with the honey and gold  
Robbing the black men, stories of old  
Why tell them truth? I cannot be  
I am the light that you never see  
  
Oh, nothing more than the lion's roar  
Gimme truth and understanding  
Oh, nothing more than the lion's roar  
  
Oh, nothing more than the lion's roar  
Gimme truth and understanding  
Oh, nothing more than the lion's roar  
Gimme truth and understanding  
  
You're nasty  
  
I know you want to see me dead  
You come on upon my head  
I know you want to see me dead  
You come on upon my head  
  
Oh, nothing more than the lion's roar  
Gimme truth and understanding  
Oh, nothing more than the lion's roar  
Oh, nothing more than the lion's roar  
Gimme truth and understanding  
Oh, nothing more than the lion's roar

You were never no good (x4)  
  
Oh no...  
You say that love is wrong  
?cause I know that love is strong  
When you get it from some they say  
That love is just thrown away  
Did they ever love you my way  
  
You were never no good (x4)  
  
Oh no...  
Someone is gonna pay  
For taking my heart away  
If it?s love that you want to show  
How am I supposed to know  
In my way  
  
You were never no good (x20)  
  
Did you say that love is wrong  
You showed you were weak from the strong  
You keep leaving me to feel  
That wicked emotion you steal  
You don?t understand

You don't have to touch it to know  
Love is everywhere you go  
You don't have to touch it to feel  
Love is every second we steal  
Love is love is nothing without you  
Love is love is everything you do  
Open up your eyes  
And you will see  
Love is love is everything to me  
You don't have to touch it to be  
Wrapped up in emotion like me  
Everyone must feel how I do, yeah  
Love is just to be close to you  
Love is love is nothing without you  
Love is love is everything you do  
Open up your eyes

Love is love is everything to me  
Love is love is nothing without you  
Love is love is everything you do  

Footsteps, movements finding people  
Clutch to the forbidden soul  
Twisting words to find a reason  
How am I supposed to throw  
Questions that I cannot answer  
Watch those boys, they dance and go  
Hung up like the rules that made them  
I'll be gone before you know  
  
[Chorus:]  
If I cry  
Let me be told  
Or give me something  
That I can hold  
  
Rhythms take me  
Do I need it  
Will we kiss, will you let go  
Twisting hearts  
Oh how we bleed them  
How am I supposed to throw  
Memories from where I keep them  
Words will only make us slow  
We are brave on the assumption  
She'll be back  
Before you know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Footsteps, movements finding people  
Clutch to the forbidden soul  
Twisting words to find a reason  
How am I supposed to throw  
Questions that I cannot answer  
Watch those boys they dance and go  
Hung up like the rules that made them  
I'll be gone before you know  
  
[Chorus]

He's the mannequin of your dreams  
You designed him  
Nothing will stand in your way  
A punch in the heart  
Won't tear him apart  
Neither will the things they say  
  
'Cause he's a beggar, lover, believer  
You are just an innocent reader  
  
He's the mannequin of your dreams  
Step inside him  
Look at the world his way  
Laughter is loud  
From the fool in the crowd  
You'll crack his smile one day  
  
Every dream must follow where we go  
Don't let them shatter your ego  
  
Mannequin, lover mannequin, lover mannequin [Repeat: x2]  
I gave you every bit of my time  
You lied and you committed a crime  
To present my feelings  
With shallow meanings  
How could you tear me apart?  
  
He's the mannequin of your dreams  
You denied him  
Laughter and political sway  
People are sweet  
But the primitive beat  
Is always getting in my way  
  
I can give you nothing but me though  
It isn't what you want to see  
  
[Repeat: x3]  
Oh Mannequin, lover mannequin  
My lover mannequin, whoa

(rap intro by derick johnson)  
Dangerous lover  
With the blue-green eyes  
Slides into the room  
He's got trouble on his mind  
Maybe you're misunderstood  
So come and lie here by my side  
'cause your love it hurts so good  
Every time, every time  
Maybe I'm a fool for loving you  
Maybe I'm a fool  
Maybe I'm a fool for wanting you  
Maybe I'm a fool  
But love's so hard to find  
I keep searching every time  
Foolish words spoken  
Forgotten in the night  
When the sun meets the ocean  
I wanna be here by your side  
Let me give you all those things  
That money just can't buy  
'cause your love it hurts so good  
Don't ask me why, don't ask me why  
Maybe I'm a fool for loving you  
Maybe I'm a fool  
Maybe I'm a fool for wanting you  
Maybe I'm a fool  
Maybe I'm a fool, but I love you baby, baby...  
(rap by derick johnson)  
(I keep searching everytime)  
Maybe I'm a fool  
Maybe I'm a fool  
Baby you're misunderstood  
So come and lie here by my side  
Cause your love it hurts so good  
Don't ask me why, just don't ask me why  
Maybe I'm a fool for loving you  
Maybe I'm a fool, I'm a fool, I'm a fool, yeah  
Maybe I'm a fool for wanting you  
Maybe I'm a fool, I'm a fool for your loving  
Right now  
Love's so hard to find  
I keep searching every time  
All the time, all the time  
Cause I can't live without you  
Can't live without you  
Maybe maybe baby I'm a fool for your loving (repeat until end)  

Take a pinch of white man  
Wrap him up in black skin  
Add a touch of blue blood  
And a little bitty bit of red indian boy  
Oh like a curly latin kinkies  
Oh lordy, lordy, mixed with yellow chinkees, yeah  
You know you lump it all together  
And you got a recipe for a get along scene  
Oh what a beautiful dream  
If it could only come true, you know, you know  
  
What we need is a great big melting pot  
Big enough enough enough to take  
The world and all it's got  
And keep it stirring for  
A hundred years or more  
And turn out coffee coloured people by the score  
  
Rabbis and the friars  
Vishnus and the gurus  
We got the beatles or the sun god  
Well it really doesn't matter  
What religion you choose  
And be thankful little mrs. Graceful  
You know that livin' could be tasteful  
We should all get together in a lovin machine  
I think I'll call up the queen  
It' s only fair that she knows, you know, you know  
  
What we need is a great big melting pot  
Big enough enough enough to take  
The world and all it's got  
And keep it stirring for  
A hundred years or more  
And turn out coffee coloured people by the score  
  
Coffee coloured people  
Coffee coloured people  
Coffee coloured people by the score

(trying to get the message through)  
You took the sun from the sky, give it back  
You know I wouldn't take a bullet for you  
You bring me down 'cause of all that you lack  
You're underhanded and you're sly with it too  
  
In a moment of desperation  
We forgive and we compromise  
Reaching out for that one sensation, life  
  
No time for wasting my time  
I'm just trying to get the message through  
You hold up a mirror to me  
You know that all you'll ever see is you  
All you'll ever see is you  
  
You know you won't change the world from your back  
But still you lie there like a vacant fool  
What happens when all your credit runs out  
And I have to be kind to be cruel  
  
In a moment of desperation  
We forgive and we close our eyes  
Reaching out for that perfect love to survive hey, yeah, yeah  
  
No time for wasting my time  
I'm just trying to get the message through (trying to get the message through)  
You hold up a mirror to me  
You know that all you'll ever see is you  
All you'll ever see is you  
  
You just don't get it  
Do ya?  
  
(I'm trying, trying to get the message)  
(I'm trying, trying to get the message)  
(I'm trying, trying to get the message) baby, baby, baby  
(I'm trying, trying to get the message)  
  
In a moment of desperation  
We forgive and we close our eyes  
Reaching out for that one sensation to survive, hey yeah  
  
No time for wasting my time  
I'm just trying to get the message through (trying to get the message through)  
You hold up a mirror to me  
You know that all you'll ever see is you (ooh-ooh)  
All you'll ever see is you  
  
(I'm trying, trying to get the message) [Repeat: x7]  
(trying to get the message through)  
  
Yeah!

Miss me  
I know you'll miss me  
I know you'll miss me blind  
  
I know you'll miss me  
I know you'll miss me  
I know you'll miss me blind  
  
Bet you got a good gun  
Bet you know how  
To have some fun and then  
You turn it around on me  
Because I'm better than the rest of the men  
  
I say you'll miss me  
And you always do  
I say you'll miss me  
Now would I lie to you  
  
Now there's no need to demand  
Grab my golden hand  
I'll teach you and you'll never be sure  
If the way that you need  
Is too much like greed  
Decide if you are rich or you're poor  
  
I know you'll miss me  
I know you'll miss me  
I know you'll miss me blind  
  
Bet you make the fool run  
Bet you know how  
To make it last forever  
But you know  
I'm never really sure  
If you're just kissing to be clever  
  
I say you'll miss me  
And you always do  
I say you'll miss me  
Now would I lie to you  
  
Now there's no need to demand  
Grab my golden hand  
I'll teach you and you'll never be sure  
If the way that you need  
Is too much like greed  
Decide if you are rich or you're poor  
  
Because the love  
That I have to give  
Must be better than that kind  
It can make you rich  
It can make you poor  
But I know that you'll miss me blind  
  
I know you'll miss me  
I know you'll miss me  
I know you'll miss me blind  

You can't by stand all the people  
Stand them on their own  
They will fall to pieces  
So we watch them grow  
Into strange and pretty faces  
I don't know  
Clutching to my lipstick traces  
Watch them go  
  
Make mistake number three [Repeat: x3]  
  
It's strange how much it changes  
How they want to know  
How cynical are people  
That's where children go  
  
Dragged into a conversation  
They can't hold  
It's so bad  
But it prepares them for the mold  
  
Make mistake number three  
(repeat three times)  
  
Why is my love like an ocean run dry?  
Why is my love  
Such a struggle with life?  
  
You can"t by stand all the people  
Stand them on their own  
They will fall to pieces  
So we watch them grow  
  
Make mistake number three [Repeat: x3]  
  
Make mistake number three

On the street  
They're preaching violence  
Mr man it's in your head  
On the street  
The midnight cowboy  
Needs no gun  
To shoot you dead  
  
Why do I live the way I do  
Ain't it obvious  
I'm just a man like you  
  
Mr man full of love  
Mr man full of hate  
Got his heart on the trigger  
But he pulled it too late  
  
Mr man is a pilot  
Mr man is a fake  
Mr man's feeling hungry  
And he's lying in wait  
  
On the street  
The lights are fighting  
Searching for someone like you  
Better find a good messiah  
To help the sad and lonely through  
  
Why do I live the way I do  
Ain't it obvious  
I'm much more black than blue  
  
On the street (they're preaching violence)  
Mr man it's in your head  
On the street  
The midnight cowboy  
Needs no gun  
To shoot you dead

Moving moving  
Move away , move away  
Spirit changed the conversation  
Stepping stones across the land  
  
I never wanted to be a hero  
I never wanted to be a man  
I hurt you darling  
I made you cry  
I hurt you darling  
Don't ask me why  
  
Move move move away from me darling  
I never said I'd hold your hand  
Move move move away from me darling  
I never said I'd understand  
If I could say this was judgment day  
You know I'd be a millionaire  
  
Justice is fine  
I need you so  
I can't let go  
I hurt you darling  
I made you cry  
I hurt you darling  
Don't ask me why  
  
Move move move away from me darling  
I never said I'd hold your hand  
Move move move away from me darling  
I never said I'd understand  
If I could say this was judgment day  
You know I'd be a millionaire  
Move move move away from me darling  
I never said I'd hold your hand  
Move move move away from me darling  
I never said I'd understand  
  
Move move move move away  
Move move move move away  
Why don't you move away

Ooh mystery boy  
Ooh mystery boy  
  
It's too sad to point the finger  
I told the boy to look at me  
But what you say it never lingers  
It's not what you say, but what you see  
  
Boy look at me  
I couldn't look no better see  
  
Ooh mystery boy  
Ooh mystery boy  
  
It's too sad that love would sting you  
You told the girl that it would be  
A kind of love that's deep within you  
A boy's a boy, but did they say he'd be  
  
For eternity?  
Or just a mystery  
  
Ooh mystery boy  
Ooh mystery boy  
Ooh mystery boy  
Ooh mystery boy  
  
Mystery boy  
Ooh  
Ooh  
Mystery mystery mystery boy  
  
It's too sad to point the finger  
I told the boy to look at me  
It's too sad that love might sting you  
You told the girl that it would be  
Some kind of love that's deep within you  
Some dream that's hard to see  
  
Mystery boy

My show  
  
Put it down, they move this town  
They follow with their eyes  
Ice cold kisses, fierce surprise  
A good, a good disguise  
Is all you need to bleed a situation  
  
You know  
  
Pull it back and put on attack  
Admission in your eyes  
Ice cold kisses compromise  
A good, a good disguise  
Is all you need to bleed a situation  
  
Let go  
  
Put it down they move this town  
They follow with their eyes  
Ice cold kisses terrorize  
A good, a good disguise  
Is all you need to bleed a situation  
  
(I could pull it with a bullet)  
Down in seven, shine a light boy  
(I could pull it with a bullet)  
What a wasted revolution  
  
(I could pull it with a bullet)  
I'm a white boy, need confusion  
(I could pull it with a bullet)  
We're all out together, together forever

You'd better run  
  
I don't know anyone as cold as you, baby  
Except those fools that cuss me on the street  
They don't bring me down the way that you do  
Steal my heart and take away my sleep  
  
So you better run, run, run  
If you're getting ready for a life of crime  
You better run, run, run  
If you're thinking maybe you can waste my time  
  
You better run

No apology necessary shut your mouth  
You've closed your mind

It don't lead to paradise  
  
In the mirror your sad reflection haunting you  
Now I see mine

One more time, one more time

Friends and lovers beware  
'Cause there's something in the air  
I feel it coming, I feel it coming  
And I'm talking to you all  
'Cause when that hammer starts to fall  
There'll be no running, there'll be no running  
  
But my people and your people  
Must do the things they do, yeah  
And my people are such sweet people  
Don't worry, baby, won't get those hooks on you  
  
Stand down, don't let them know your secret  
(Stand)  
Stand down, if you wanna live your life  
(Stand)  
Stand down, don't let them know your secret  
(Stand)  
Stand down, if you wanna live your life  
(Stand)  
Stand down, ooh yeah, stand down, yeah  
  
It is written in the sky  
There's no place for you and I  
To keep on strumming, no strumming  
In the message that we send  
They're gonna tell us in the end  
That we had it coming, we had it coming  
  
But my people and your people  
Must do the things they do, yeah  
And my people are such sweet people  
Don't worry, baby, won't get those hooks on you  
  
Stand down, don't let 'em know your secret  
(Stand)  
Stand down if you wanna live your life  
(Stand)  
Stand down, don't let 'em know your secret  
(Stand)  
Stand down if you want, if you wanna live your life  
(Stand)  
  
If all the things that we possess  
The most important is tenderness  
Too cold when that wind blows today  
And bitterness is the easy way  
  
Stand down low  
Stand down  
Got to, got to need  
You got to  
  
But my people and your people  
Must do the things they do, yeah  
And my people are such sweet people  
Don't worry, baby, won't get those hooks on you  
  
Stand down, don't let 'em know your secret  
(Stand)  
Stand down if you wanna live your life  
(Stand)  
Stand down, don't let them know your secret  
(Stand)  
Stand down if you wanna live your life  
(Stand)  
  
Stand down  
(Stand)  
Stand down  
(Stand)  
Stand down

Didn't know what time it was and the lights were low  
I leaned back on my radio  
Some cat was layin' down some rock 'n' roll 'lotta soul, he said  
Then the loud sound did seem to fade  
Came back like a slow voice on a wave of phase  
That weren't no D.J. that was hazy cosmic jive  
  
There's a starman waiting in the sky  
He'd like to come and meet us  
But he thinks he'd blow our minds  
There's a starman waiting in the sky  
He's told us not to blow it  
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile  
He told me  
Let the children lose it  
Let the children use it  
Let all the children boogie  
  
I had to phone someone so I picked on you  
Hey, that's far out so you heard him too!  
Switch on the TV we may pick him up on channel two  
Look out your window I can see his light  
If we can sparkle he may land tonight  
Don't tell your poppa or he'll get us locked up in fright  
  
There's a starman waiting in the sky  
He'd like to come and meet us  
But he thinks he'd blow our minds  
There's a starman waiting in the sky  
He's told us not to blow it  
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile  
He told me  
Let the children lose it  
Let the children use it  
Let all the children boogie  
  
There's a starman waiting in the sky  
He'd like to come and meet us  
But he thinks he'd blow our minds  
There's a starman waiting in the sky  
He's told us not to blow it  
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile  
He told me  
Let the children lose it  
Let the children use it  
Let all the children boogie  
  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

How can I help you boy  
When I don't even help myself  
I'm useless now as I have always been  
Just like some worthless love song dying on the radio  
We talk in circles til we don't know what we mean  
Ain't No happy ever after  
No big dark man  
Ain't no perfect situation  
Can't you understand  
  
Loving you is some strange voodoo  
Loving you is some strange voodoo  
  
How can I love you boy  
When you don't even love yourself  
I'm useless now as I have always been  
Your lying eyes  
Your thieving hands  
You're such a rogue at times  
But you will always be a part of me  
No happy ever after  
No big dark man  
Ain't no perfect situation  
Ain't no master plan  
  
Loving you is some strange voodoo  
Loving you is some strange voodoo  
Ain't no happy ever after  
No big dark man  
Ain't no perfect situation  
Can't you understand  
  
Loving you is some strange voodoo  
Loving you is some strange voodoo  
Loving you I keep loving you yes I do

Oh Lord, gimme strength  
Sweet Lord, gimme love  
Oh Lord, gimme strength  
Sweet Lord, gimme love  
  
I'm not your lover, I wanna be your friend  
But I need something, do you comprehend?  
It took a long time for this heart to mend  
There's something wrong with the love you send  
  
Oh give me strength, oh Lord above  
I need some of that sweet toxic love  
Sweet toxic love pouring through my veins  
To lift me up to make me insane  
  
I'm not your punch bag I'm not your floor  
You can't walk on me until you get bored  
Before you break it, you must be sure  
That you can't use this love no more  
  
Oh give me strength, oh Lord above  
I need some of that sweet toxic love  
Sweet toxic love pouring through my veins  
To lift me up, to make me insane  
  
God would have loved you but he never had the chance  
Love it means nothing till it's slipping through your hands  
And all the people with their problems and their plans  
Though it's nothing new for me and you, I still know who I am  
  
Oh give me strength, oh Lord above  
I need some of that sweet toxic love  
Sweet toxic love pouring through my veins  
To lift me up, to make me insane  
  
Oh Lord, gimme stregth  
Sweet Lord, gimme love  
Oh Lord, gimme strength  
Sweet Lord, gimme love

Clowns caress you  
Figures undress your fear  
Induced to crime beyond emotion  
Shedding tears as big as the ocean  
  
Don't say you didn't hear us callin'  
Ooh, ooh, you'll be sorry in the mornin'  
When we tell you  
Mama had tears in her eyes  
She's the only one who never cries  
  
That's the way we destroy a baby  
Shut it out, shut it out  
That's the way we destroy a baby  
Shut it out of your mind  
That's the way, that's the way  
  
If I address you  
And you see me in the shadows fallin'  
Call, caress me  
Hey I woke up on my own this mornin'  
  
Don't say you didn't hear us callin'  
Ooh, ooh, you'll be sorry in the mornin'  
When we tell you  
Mama had tears in her eyes  
She's the only one who never lies  
  
That's the way we destroy a baby  
Shut it out, shut it out  
That's the way we destroy a baby  
Shut it out of your mind  
That's the way, that's the way  
  
I'm only tryin' to help you, baby  
(Only tryin' to help you, yeah)  
I'm only tryin' to help you, baby  
(Only tryin' to help you)  
I'm only tryin' to help you, baby  
(Only tryin', only tryin' only tryin' to help you)  
  
I'm only tryin' to help you, baby  
(Only tryin' to help you)  
I'm only tryin' to help you  
(Only tryin' to help you)  
I'm only tryin' to help you  
(Only tryin' to help you)  
I'm only tryin' to help you

I know all there is to know  
About the cryin' game  
I've had my share  
Of the cryin' game  
First there are kisses  
Then there are sighs  
And then before you know where you are  
You're sayin' goodbye  
One day soon I'm gonna tell the moon  
About the cryin' game  
And if he knows  
Maybe he'll explain  
Why there are heartaches?  
Why there are tears?  
And what to do, to stop feeling blue  
When love disappears  
First there are kisses  
Then there are sighs  
And then before you know where you are  
You're sayin' goodbye  
Don't want no more  
Of the cryin' game  
Don't want no more  
Of the cryin' game  
Don't want no more  
Of the cryin' game  
Don't want no more  
Of the cryin' game  
No more  

Like Alice in Wonderland  
The dream takes you by the hand  
Inside emotions that you might not feel  
If by some notion the dream was not real  
The dream, the dream, the dream  
  
Watching the colors as they run  
Figures you mold like the sun  
Lovers can dream, devils can dream  
You may be nowhere until you have seen  
  
The dream, the dream, the dream whoa  
Oh what have I done?  
Close my eyes and I dream of some world  
It could be magic, it could be tragic  
  
Hee, dream  
The dream, the dream, the dream whoa

Sun go east, sun go west  
Sun go east, sun go west  
  
You used to say love and be loved all the time  
'Til you discovered feelings were a failure sign  
When it rains, it rains so hard  
The tears begin to show  
Now it's raining in my heart  
I want the world to know  
  
Life will never be the same as it was again  
Life will never be the same as it was again  
Through my anger and my joy, my tears and pain  
Life will never be the same as it was again  
  
Beneath the sea of Hollywood where Frances used to reign  
They trade their deepest wishes for a part in someone's game  
Spirits die alone at night  
For life they cannot hold  
I would rather dance with you  
Than have a medal to show  
  
Life will never be the same as it was again  
Life will never be the same as it was again  
Through my anger and my joy, my tears and pain  
Life will never be the same as it was again  
  
Sun go east, sun go west  
Will I wear a medal again  
Sun go east, sun go west  
We can dance and bring on the rain  
  
Now I say love for love, not a space in time  
The strangest things can shatter kings and take away what's mine  
When it's raining in my heart  
I want the world to know  
I would rather dance with you  
Than have a medal to show  
  
Life will never be the same as it was again  
Life will never be the same as it was again  
Through my anger and my joy, my tears and pain  
Life will never be the same as it was again  
  
We are just everyday people, not a theatre company  
Everyone wants to join us, there's no fear in us you see  
It's me for you and you for me  
  
Sun go east, sun go west  
Will I wear a medal again  
Sun go east, sun go west  
We can dance and bring on the rain  

War war is stupid and people are stupid  
And love means nothing in some strange quarters  
War war is stupid and people are stupid  
And I heard them banging on hearts and fingers  
War!  
  
People fill the world with narrow confidence  
Like a child at birth, a man with no defence  
What's mine's my own, I won't give it to you  
No matter what you say, no matter what you do  
  
Now we're fighting in our hearts  
Fighting in the streets  
Won't somebody help me?  
  
War war is stupid and people are stupid  
And love means nothing in some strange quarters  
War war is stupid and people are stupid  
And I heard them banging on hearts and fingers  
War!  
  
Man is far behind in the search of something new  
Like a Philistine, we're burning witches too  
This world of hate must be designed for you  
It matters what you say, it matters what you do  
  
Now we're fighting in our hearts  
Fighting in the streets  
Won't somebody help me?  
  
War war is stupid and people are stupid  
And love means nothing in some strange quarters  
War war is stupid and people are stupid  
And I heard them banging on hearts and fingers  
War! War! War!  
  
After the bird has flown  
He walked ten thousand miles back home  
You can't do that to me, no, you can't do that to me  
You can't do that to me, no, you can't do that to me  
  
War!  
  
In this heart of mine, I'll find a place for you  
For black or white, for grown-up children too  
  
Now we're fighting in our hearts  
Fighting in the streets  
Won't somebody help me?  
  
War war is stupid and people are stupid  
And love means nothing in some strange quarters  
War war is stupid and people are stupid  
And I heard them banging on hearts and fingers  
  
No more war  
say no more war  
say war  
Senso hant-ai  
Senso hant-ai  
Say no more war  

Don't put your head on my shoulder  
Sink me in a river of tears  
This could be the best place yet  
But you must overcome your fears  
  
[Chorus:]  
Oh, in time  
It could have been so much more  
The time is precious I know  
In time  
It could have been so much more  
The time has nothing to show  
  
Because  
Time won't give me time  
And time makes lovers feel  
Like they've got something real  
But you and me  
We know we've got  
Nothin' but time  
And time won't give me time  
Won't give me time  
(Time, time, time)  
  
Don't make me feel any colder  
Time is like a clock in my heart  
Touch we, touch was the  
Heat too much  
I felt I  
Lost you from the start  
  
[Chorus: x2]

Just see how she makes them love her  
Twisting the world around her finger  
Sensing weakness in a stranger  
With one kiss she'll re-arrange ya  
But I know the truth behind her smile  
Keep me warm tonight, never satisfy  
If you meet again she may pass you by  
No apologies, never compromise  
It's the truth behind her smile  
Just see how she makes them want her  
Oh, if I could be her for one day  
Sensing weakness in a stranger  
See them run, no sense of danger  
But I know the truth behind her smile  
Keep me warm tonight, never satisfy  
If you meet again she may pass you by  
No apologies, never compromise  
It's the truth behind her smile  
She'll let you down  
Keep me warm tonight, never satisfy  
If you meet again she may pass you by  
No apologies, never compromise  
It's the truth behind her...  
Truth behind her smile  

Breaking out of school  
Ain't really fooling no one  
I was sure I'd get my reward in time  
Backing on the street  
With the smell of sweet sensation  
Didn't want to be another dime  
Hidden in the pocket  
Of some unfortunate nation  
Didn't have no money, sure didn't have the time  
  
[Chorus:]  
Unfortunate thing, such an unfortunate thing  
Unfortunate thing, such an unfortunate thing  
But I fought with nothing  
But I fought with nothing  
  
Laughing at the rumor  
That you've been screwing someone  
Laugh better cry  
It could be your turn next time  
Brother what a lover beyond the fourth dimension  
He's got an ego  
That's bigger than yours and mine  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Don't call me Bwana  
Let it settle in your heart  
We move from children  
Into a business counterpart  
Your head was shaking as I walked into the room  
A spirit breaking  
That's why I feel this way  
  
Breaking out of school  
Ain't really fooling no one  
I was sure I'd get my reward in time  
Backing up a street  
With a smell of sweet sensation  
Didn't want to be another dime  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Unfortunate thing

The victims we know so well  
They shine in your eyes  
When they kiss and tell  
Strange places we never see  
But you're always there  
Like a ghost in my dream  
And I keep on telling you  
Please don't do the things you do  
When you do those things  
Pull my puppet strings  
I have the strangest void for you  
  
We love and we never tell  
What places our hearts in the wishing well  
Love leads us into the stream  
And it's sink or swim  
Like it's always been  
And I keep on loving you  
It's the only thing to do  
When the angel sings  
There are greater things  
Can I give them all to you  
  
Pull the strings of emotion  
Take a ride into unknown pleasure  
Feel like a child on a dark night  
Wishing there was some kind of heaven  
I could be warm with you smiling  
Hold out your hand for a while  
The victims we know them so well...  
  
The victims we know so well  
They shine in your eyes when they kiss and tell  
Strange places we never see  
But you're always there like a ghost in my dream  
And I keep on telling you  
Please don't do the things you do  
When you do those things, pull my puppet strings  
I have the strangest void for you  
  
Show my heart some devotion  
Push aside those that whisper never  
Feel like a child on a dark night  
Wishing there were some kind of heaven  
I could be warm with you smiling  
Hold out your hand for a while  
The victims we know them so well, so well...  

Hey you, do you ever cry - for the child?  
  
Falling in love with strangers, feeling incomplete, hey that's me  
Some are fly, some are shy, some are acting like they own the street, ooh  
One minute we're together then the next you're acting really cool, so cool  
You can play me any way but don't ever treat me like a fool, no no no  
  
Sometimes so hateful  
Sometimes so shy  
Don't ask me why  
  
Weep for the child  
Better raise your hand  
We're twisting the style  
Ain't no need to understand  
Don't leave me alone to make it tonight  
No don't go  
  
Wearing your desperation wrapped me on your sleeve, yes you do  
You've got everything you want but you just can't get the things that you
need, oh no no no  
  
Sometimes you fake it  
Sometimes you lie  
Don't ask me why  
  
Weep for the child  
Better raise your hand, raise your hand  
We're twisting the style  
Ain't no need to understand  
Don't leave me alone to make it tonight, no no no  
  
Sweet baby  
  
You never understood  
You never treat me right  
  
Weep for the child  
Better raise your hand, raise your hand  
We're twisting the style  
Ain't no need to understand, do you understand?  
Don't leave me alone to make it tonight, yeah  
  
Weep for the child  
Weep  
Weep  
Weep  
In your heart  
  
Weep for the child  
Better raise your hand, raise your hand  
We're twisting the style  
Ain't no need to understand, no need  
Don't leave me alone to make it  
Alone to make it  
Alone to make it tonight

Right there it is!  
Pretty faces perfect hair make 'I see you' when  
You float into my vision once again, yeah  
Promises are in your eyes, never to return  
Inside your love I'm bound to burn  
  
Now you don't understand the rivers and the seas are turning  
Now it's out of my hands and I won't be a fool for learning  
What do you want from me  
I give you everything you need  
Twisted security  
I give you everything you need  
What do you want  
Pretty faces break your heart words that turn to dust  
I need to love and you I trust  
Waiting for the wheel to turn shall I waste my life  
A key to hold to paradise  
  
Now you don't understand the rivers and the seas are turning  
Now it's out of my hands and I won't be a fool for learning  
What do you want from me  
I give you everything you need  
Twisted security  
I give you everything you need  
What do you want from me  
I give you everything you need  
Twisted security  
I give you everything you need  
Love a we, a love a we, love a we, I love ya  
Love a we, a love a we, love a we, I need ya  
  
Now you don't understand the rivers and the seas are turning  
Now it's out of my hands but I won't be a fool for learning  
What do you want from me  
I give you everything you need  
Twisted security  
I give you everything you need  
What do you want from me  
I give you everything you need  
Twisted security  
I give you everything you need

Black boys employ Selassie  
We kiss, we define  
White hands, white hearts  
The gender  
How can I make you mine  
  
Take me to God  
In a world of blank kisses  
Who breaks the colors  
I know what this is  
A one man show  
That's how we know  
That's how we know  
Your white does the blood flow  
  
[Chorus:]  
Your white dance like an enemy  
Your white dance like an enemy  
Your white dance like an enemy  
  
White boys fall out  
In a whirl of decisions  
Show me what is  
Then show me what isn't  
A heart too slow  
That's how we know  
That's how we know  
Your white does the blood flow  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You're so white  
You're so white  
White boy [Repeat: x6]  
  
White boy dance  
Do something sweet  
Like pull my heart  
Like use your feet  
Like steal some culture  
Let's fake this dance  
A white boy kiss  
A white boy chance  
Don't take me over  
Abuse my heart  
When I change color, I'm here, stop, start  
  
Hey devil kiss me  
I'm taking chances  
Not faking my culture  
The rhythm it dances  
I love your wisdom  
I love your mind  
White boys are babies (not my kind)  
This lust in fashion  
That's my sin  
By falling out  
We're falling in  
Now I'm broken  
Watch it flow  
I'm taking over  
Can't let go (falling out with the bad boys)

When your a white boy  
Life gets you high  
You hold out thinking  
  
And you know why  
You hold out  
With the law of men  
And when you die  
Your born again  
Put down your gun  
And find your heart  
We're dying soldiers  
We don't dance (for the devil)  
When your a white boy  
Your life is lust  
You kiss and run  
  
And you mistrust  
You hold out  
With the nowhere men  
You dance your dance  
And try again  
Put down your gun  
And find your heart  
We're dying soldiers  
  
In the dark (we are no rebels)  
You know white boys (can't control it)  
You know white boys (never hold it)  
You know white boys (hard to swallow)  
You know white boys always follow  
(follow who?)  
  
Put down your gun  
And find your heart  
We're dying soldiers  
We don't dance (for the devil)

I wanna tell you something girl  
  
God intended and you planned it  
It was meant to be  
Like a lover, or a brother  
I'll shield you from the enemy  
  
Don't say forever  
Don't say forever  
Hold me  
Let's stay together  
Let's say together  
Look in my eyes  
Can't you see what I need?  
  
Work on me baby  
Work on me baby  
I do it better when I'm under pressure  
Work on me baby  
Work on me baby  
Some boys are devils  
And some fools say  
Maybe we'll work it out  
  
I think we'll work it out  
  
God intended, he depended  
On our honesty  
Like a lover, like no other  
I'll shield you from the enemy  
  
You've been trying baby  
Just painting a picture for me  
Ain't no use crying darling  
When we love so easily  
  
Every day in every way we'll work

Last night you breathed the deepest sigh  
Turned away with those cold cool eyes  
You said won't you give me space to breathe  
And my tears gave it confidence to leave  
Now you say I'm just to much for you  
There are things you'll never know  
If you lie and cheat so easily  
You'd better go  
Go go go yeah  
All I know is how I feel  
And my heart was always yours to steal  
But you take and never give to me  
Your kisses are charity  
Your kisses are charity  
Yesterday you were my brightest star  
But even when you're near  
I don't know where you are  
I was wrong to show my weaker side  
Now it's much too late to cry cry cry  
I was blind to put my trust in you  
If you leave me I'll fall apart  
Did you plan to make a fool out of me  
From the start  
Yeah yeah yeah  
All I know is how I feel  
And my heart was always yours to steal  
But you take and never give to me  
Your kisses are charity  
Your kisses are charity  
Now you say I'm too much for you  
There are things you'll never know  
If you lie and cheat so easily  
You'd better go  
Go go go yeah  
All I know is how I feel  
And my heart was always yours to steal  
But you take and never give to me  
Your kisses are charity  
Your kisses are charity
