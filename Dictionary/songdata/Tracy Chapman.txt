It's just a theory  
There's a possibility I am wrong  
It's just a theory  
But I would stake my life  
Lay my money down  
That you were meant for me  
And for you I'm the one  
  
It's just a theory  
A particular set of assumptions  
It's just a theory  
An educated guess  
A conclusion not forgone  
That you were meant for me  
And for you I'm the one  
  
Oh nothing's new under the sun  
I will postulate  
Ask for your consideration  
Ask you out on a date  
Although it can't be sure  
Why not act on a hunch  
Oh why not search for proof  
Why not go out for lunch  
And in theory, I could propose  
And in theory you could affirm  
Oh that you were meant for me  
And for you I'm the one  
Oh that you were meant for me  
And for you I'm the one  
  
It's just a theory  
A series of tests should be run.  
It's just a theory although not fully assessed  
An idea whose time has come  
That you were meant for me  
And for you I'm the one  
That you were meant for me  
And for you I'm the one

Oh my mama told me  
'Cause she say she learned the hard way  
Say she want to spare the children  
She say don't give or sell your soul away  
'Cause all that you have is your soul  
  
Don't be tempted by the shiny apple  
Don't you eat of a bitter fruit  
Hunger only for a taste of justice  
Hunger only for a world of truth  
'Cause all that you have is your soul  
  
I was a pretty young girl once  
I had dreams I had high hopes  
I married a man he stole my heart away  
He gave his love but what a high price I paid  
And all that you have is your soul  
  
Why was I such a young fool  
Thought I'd make history  
Making babies was the best I could do  
Thought I'd made something that could be mine forever  
Found out the hard way one can't possess another  
And all that you have is your soul  
  
I thought thought that I could find a way  
To beat the system  
To make a deal and have no debts to pay  
I'd take it all take it all I'd run away  
Me for myself first class and first rate  
But all that you have is your soul  
  
Here I am waiting for a better day  
A second chance  
A little luck to come my way  
A hope to dream a hope that I can sleep again  
And wake in the world with a clear conscience and clean hands  
'Cause all that you have is your soul  
  
All that you have  
All that you have  
All that you have  
Is your soul

Almost got what I want  
Almost found what I lost  
Almost saved you and myself  
Almost won but it doesn't count  
And never does  
Never does  
  
One green light  
One more ring of the telephone  
One more step  
One more second  
And I almost  
Almost  
  
Almost got what I want  
Almost found what I lost  
Almost saved you and myself  
Almost won but it doesn't count  
And never does  
Never does  
  
One hello  
Just one kiss before the tears come  
One yes  
One chance  
And I almost  
Almost almost almost  
  
Almost got what I want  
Almost found what I lost  
Almost saved you and myself  
Almost won but it doesn't count  
And never does  
Never does  
  
One day one year  
5,000 weeks  
A life of good works and good deeds  
Let me be let me be closer  
Or let me be  
Let me be  
Let me be  
  
When I've almost got what I want  
Almost found what I lost  
Almost saved you and myself  
Almost won but it doesn't count  
And never does  
Never does  
  
One good guess  
A question with an answer that I know  
One idea  
One grand notion  
And I almost  
Almost almost almost  
  
Almost got what I want  
Almost found what I lost  
Almost saved you and myself  
Almost won but it doesn't count  
And never does  
Never does  
Never does  
Never does

You were lost and got lucky  
Came upon the shore  
Found you were conquering America  
You spoke of peace  
But waged a war  
While you were conquering America  
  
There was land to take  
And people to kill  
While you were conquering America  
You served yourself  
Did God's will  
While you were conquering America  
  
The ghost of Columbus haunts this world  
'Cause you're still conquering America  
The meek won't survive  
Or inherit the earth  
Cause you're still conquering America  
  
America [Repeat: x3]  
  
You found bodies to serve  
Submit and degrade  
While you were conquering America  
Made us soldiers and junkies  
Prisoners and slaves  
While you were conquering America  
  
America [Repeat: x3]  
  
You hands are at my throat  
My back's against the wall  
Because you're still conquering America  
We're sick and tired hungry and poor  
Cause you're still conquering America  
  
You bomb the very ground  
That feeds your own babies  
You're still conquering America  
Your sons and your daughters  
May never sing your praises  
While you're conquering America  
  
America [Repeat: x3]  
  
I see you eyes seek a distant shore  
While you're conquering America  
Taking rockets to the moon  
Trying to find a new world  
And you're still conquering America  
  
America [Repeat: x3]  
  
The ghost of Columbus haunts this world  
Cause you're still conquering America  
You're still conquering America  
You're still conquering America

Trouble won't find me  
Sorrow won't call  
Sadness will turn away  
Searching for a new soul  
Hardship won't come by  
All pain will cease  
Somebody will take my place  
And suffer for me  
  
If I never see another sun  
If I never see another sun  
If I never see another sun  
Another sun another sun  
  
If no love will comfort me  
If no kind words come  
To offer hope or peace  
When I have fallen  
If I be a stranger  
Friend of no one  
I'll gladly take my place  
In the world beyond  
  
If I never see another sun  
If I never see another sun  
If I never see another sun  
Another sun another sun  
  
If I lay down and wake to see  
The bright light of the morn  
Rise up every day  
To blind beat and burn  
Show me no mercy  
For need or want  
Let somebody take my place  
When the new day dawns  
  
If I never see another sun  
If I never see another sun  
If I never see another sun  
Another sun another sun

Done so many things wrong I don't know if I can do right  
Oh I, Oh I've  
Done so many things wrong I don't know if I can do right  
  
At this point in my life  
I've done so many things wrong I don't know if I can do right  
If you put your trust in me I hope I won't let you down  
If you give me a chance I'll try  
  
You see it's been a hard road the road I'm traveling on  
And if I take your hand I might lead you down the path to ruin  
I've had a hard life I'm just saying it so you'll understand  
That right now, right now, I'm doing the best I can  
At this point in my life  
  
At this point in my life  
Although I've mostly walked in the shadows  
I'm still searching for the light  
Won't you put your faith in me  
We both know that's what matters  
If you give me a chance I'll try  
  
You see I've been climbing stairs but mostly stumbling down  
I've been reaching high always losing ground  
You see I've been reaching high but always losing ground  
You see I've conquered hills but I still have mountains to climb  
And right now right now I'm doing the best I can  
At this point in my life  
  
Before we take a step  
Before we walk down that path  
Before I make any promises  
Before you have regrets  
Before we talk commitment  
Let me tell you of my past  
All I've seen and all I've done  
The things I'd like to forget  
At this point in my life  
  
At this point in my life  
I'd like to live as if only love mattered  
As if redemption was in sight  
As if the search to live honestly  
Is all that anyone needs  
No matter if you find it  
  
You see when I've touched the sky  
The earth's gravity has pulled me down  
But now I've reconciled that in this world  
Birds and angels get the wings to fly  
If you can believe in this heart of mine  
If you can give it a try  
Then I'll reach inside and find and give you  
All the sweetness that I have  
At this point in my life  
At this point in my life  

Sorry  
Is all that you can't say  
Years gone by and still  
Words don't come easily  
Like sorry like sorry  
  
Forgive me  
Is all that you can't say  
Years gone by and still  
Words don't come easily  
Like forgive me forgive me  
  
But you can say baby  
Baby can I hold you tonight  
Maybe if I told you the right words  
At the right time you'd be mine  
  
I love you  
Is all that you can't say  
Years gone by and still  
Words don't come easily  
Like I love you I love you

What you go and do  
You go and give the boy a gun  
Now there ain't place to run to  
Ain't no place to run to  
  
When he hold it in his hand  
He feel mighty he feel strong  
Now there ain't no place to run to  
Ain't no place to run  
  
One day he may come back  
Repay us for what we've done  
Then where you gonna run to  
Where you gonna run  
  
But one fine day  
All our problems will be solved  
Bang bang bang  
We'll shoot him down  
  
Give him drugs and give him candy  
Anything to make him think he's happy  
And he won't ever come for us  
He won't ever come  
  
But if he does  
And if there's no one else around  
Bang bang bang  
We'll shoot him down  
  
If he preys only on his neighbors  
Brothers sisters and friends  
We'll consider it a favor  
We'll consider justice done  
  
But if he comes for you or me  
And we can place a gun in his hand  
Bang bang bang  
We'll shoot him dead  
  
What you go and do  
You go and give the boy a gun  
Now there ain't no place to run to  
Ain't no place to run  
  
Now we'll all be at his mercy  
If he decides to hunt us down  
Cause there ain't no place to run to  
Ain't no place to run  
  
If he wants the chances that you took from him  
And nothing that you own  
Then there'll be no place to run to  
There'll be no place to run  
  
And if he finds himself to be  
A reflection of us all  
Bang bang bang  
He'll shoot us down  
  
Before you can raise your eyes to read  
The writing on the wall  
Bang bang bang  
He'll shoot you down  
  
Before you can bridge the gulf between  
And embrace him in your arms  
Bang bang bang  
He'll shoot you down  

I believe in mistakes and accidents  
That the nature of life is chaos and confusion  
That man's rules of law and order  
May not stand  
  
And I should be and be not afraid  
To reach for heaven  
  
I may think that I know  
The true heart's needs  
But my pride may bring me low  
Unable to see  
I'm no closer than yesterday  
But tomorrow I may stand  
  
And be and be not afraid  
To reach for heaven  
  
I'll see the black car cavalcade  
Lights on in the morn  
I'll run fast and far away  
I'll run without stopping  
Til hear and feet fail  
Or until I can stand  
  
And be and be not afraid  
  
Be and be not afraid  
Be and be not afraid  
To reach for heaven

You and your sweet smile  
You and your tantalizing ways  
You and your honey lips  
You and all the sweet things that they say  
You and your wild wild ways  
One day you just up and walked away  
You left me hurting  
  
But I can forgive you for that now  
You taught me something  
Something took half my life to learn  
When you give all yourself away  
Just tell them to be careful of your heart  
  
Be careful of my heart, heart  
Be careful of this heart of mine  
Be careful of my heart, heart  
It just might break and send some splinters flying  
Be careful of my heart, heart  
Be careful  
  
You you you  
You you you  
You you you  
Took my love  
Thought you took it all  
  
You you you  
You you you  
You you you  
Took my love  
And now you're gone  
  
But I'm not breaking down  
And I'm not falling apart  
I just lost a little faith  
When you broke my heart  
Given a chance I might try it again  
But I wouldn't risk it all this time  
  
I'd save  
A little love for myself  
Enough for my heart to mend  
A little love for myself  
One day I just might love again  
One day some sweet smile might turn my head  
One day I just might give all myself away  
One day  
One day  
One day  

I may beg  
Beg for money  
I may lie and lay my body down  
Sell what I would give with love  
One day before Easter comes  
But I won't let Jesus find me  
  
I walk I eat I sleep  
In these streets I may be found  
Alive or dead or just reborn  
One day before Easter comes  
But I won't let Jesus find me  
  
Jesus knows what I've done  
I won't let him lift me up  
Before I can turn  
To look for him  
Before I can turn  
To look for him  
If Jesus comes around again  
  
I'll cry I'll cry  
I'll cry for help  
I'll let you be the one  
To try to redeem the sins of man  
One day before Easter comes  
But I won't let Jesus find me  
  
I'm gonna hide  
Hide from him  
Hide myself but not the sin  
I'm gonna hide  
Hide from him  
Hide myself but no the sin  
If Jesus comes around again  
I've got the rock the needle  
The bottle of sorrow  
And Jesus Jesus Jesus knows

Last night I heard the screaming  
Loud voices behind the wall  
Another sleepless night for me  
It won't do no good to call  
The police always come late  
If they come at all  
  
And when they arrive  
They say they can't interfere  
With domestic affairs  
Between a man and his wife  
And as they walk out the door  
The tears well up in her eyes  
  
Last night I heard the screaming  
Then a silence that chilled my soul  
I prayed that I was dreaming  
When I saw the ambulance in the road  
And the policeman said  
"I'm here to keep the peace  
Will the crowd disperse  
I think we all could use some sleep"

All you folks think you own my life  
But you never made any sacrifice  
Demons they are on my trail  
I'm standing at the crossroads of the hell  
I look to the left I look to the right  
There're hands that grab me on every side  
  
All you folks think I got my price  
At which I'll sell all that is mine  
You think money rules when all else fails  
Go sell your soul and keep your shell  
I'm trying to protect what I keep inside  
All the reasons why I live my life  
  
Some say the devil be a mystical thing  
I say the devil he a walking man  
He a fool he a liar conjurer and a thief  
He try to tell you what you want  
Try to tell you what you need  
  
Standing at the point  
The road it cross you down  
What is at your back  
Which way do you turn  
Who will come to find you first  
Your devils or your gods  
  
All you folks think you run my life  
Say I should be willing to compromise  
I say all you demons go back to hell  
I'll save my soul save myself  

Don't dwell on the past  
Love that was lost and didn't last  
That summer bloom is fading fast  
But I'm falling for you  
  
Don't dwell on the pain  
Tears you've cried  
And autumn rain  
That fair weather's here and gone again  
But I'm waiting for you  
  
Don't dwell on the loss  
The fool that would steal break and toss  
That winter's heart will spurn and double-cross  
But I'm yearning for you  
  
Don't dwell on the time  
The seasons change  
And so does the clime  
That old flame has cooled  
But I'm burning for you

I know I may be wishing  
On a world  
That may never be  
But I'll keep on wishing  
No matter how hopeless  
Or foolish  
It may seem  
I'll keep on wishing  
  
I'll toss my coins in the fountain  
Look for clovers in grassy lawns  
Search for shooting stars in the night  
Cross my fingers and dream on  
I know I may be dreaming  
Of a world  
Far from present day reality  
But I'll keep on dreaming  
  
No matter how unrealistic  
Or naive  
It may seem  
Always keep dreaming  
And toss your coins in the fountain  
Look for clovers in grassy lawns  
Search for shooting stars in the night  
Cross your fingers and dream on  
  
We must always be thinking  
Of a world  
As a place of infinite possibilities  
And always keep thinking  
No matter how hopeless  
Or foolish  
It may seem  
Always keep thinking  
  
And toss our coins in the fountain  
Look for clovers in grassy lawns  
Search for shooting stars in the night  
Cross our fingers and dream on  
I'll keep on wishing  
We must always keep dreaming  
Of a world  
  
With equality and justice  
Thinking  
There could be a world  
Without poverty and sickness  
Wishing  
Of a world  
  
Without hunger and homelessness  
Dreaming  
Of a world  
Where all people live in peace  
Dreaming  
Of a world  
Dreaming  
On a world

You got a fast car  
I want a ticket to anywhere  
Maybe we make a deal  
Maybe together we can get somewhere  
Anyplace is better  
Starting from zero got nothing to lose  
Maybe we'll make something  
Me, myself I got nothing to prove  
  
You got a fast car  
I got a plan to get us out of here  
I been working at the convenience store  
Managed to save just a little bit of money  
Won't have to drive too far  
Just 'cross the border and into the city  
You and I can both get jobs  
And finally see what it means to be living  
  
You see my old man's got a problem  
He live with the bottle that's the way it is  
He says his body's too old for working  
His body's too young to look like his  
My mama went off and left him  
She wanted more from life than he could give  
I said somebody's got to take care of him  
So I quit school and that's what I did  
  
You got a fast car  
Is it fast enough so we can fly away  
We gotta make a decision  
Leave tonight or live and die this way  
  
So remember we were driving, driving in your car  
Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk  
City lights lay out before us  
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder  
I had a feeling that I belonged  
I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone  
  
You got a fast car  
We go cruising to entertain ourselves  
You still ain't got a job  
I work in a market as a checkout girl  
I know things will get better  
You'll find work and I'll get promoted  
We'll move out of the shelter  
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs  
  
I remember we were driving, driving in your car  
Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk  
City lights lay out before us  
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder  
I had a feeling that I belonged  
I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone  
  
You got a fast car  
I got a job that pays all our bills  
You stay out drinking late at the bar  
See more of your friends than you do of your kids  
I'd always hoped for better  
Thought maybe together you and me would find it  
I got no plans I ain't going nowhere  
So take your fast car and keep on driving  
  
I remember we were driving, driving in your car  
Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk  
City lights lay out before us  
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder  
I had a feeling that I belonged  
I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone  
  
You got a fast car  
But is it fast enough so you can fly away  
You gotta make a decision  
Leave tonight or live and die this way

Can't run fast enough  
Can't hide I can't fly  
I'm struggling with the limits of this ordinary life  
  
I'm just a  
Just a  
Just a first try  
  
Can't hear what you say  
Can't see by the light  
I'm struggling with the limits of this ordinary life  
  
I'm just a  
Just a  
Just a first try  
  
Can't say what I mean  
Can't love from the heart  
Can't trust in the mercy and the goodness in the world  
Can't learn to accept that it's alright  
To struggle with the limits of this ordinary life  
  
Can't be  
Just a  
Just a first try  
Can't be  
Just a  
Just a first try  
Just a  
Just a  
Just a first try  

I picture us together  
Framed in gold leaf  
On the mantle with the others  
One big happy family  
But that snapshot can't be found  
And I don't trust my memory  
  
[Chorus:]  
But it's alright it's alright  
For a dream  
  
I imagine we are gathered  
But this time not dressed in black  
There's laughing and smiling  
Not stabbing in the back  
But it's too good to be true  
And too bad I still recall the screams  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I keep half the picture  
Mostly in my mind  
Mama dressed in white  
Ripped when she held your hand  
Showing no signs of age  
Just slightly frayed along the seam  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
It's alright  
All that I can claim  
It's alright  
And it will have to do  
It's alright  
Better than the pain  
It's alright  
Better than the truth  
It's alright  
Alright for a dream  
It's alright  
Better than fate and the great scheme  
It's alright  
It's alright  
  
For Christmas and for New Year  
I wish and I resolve  
But I'm disappointed by myself Jesus and Santa Claus  
I want to believe  
She's been saved  
And he's be redeemed  
  
And it's alright it's alright  
For a dream

They throwed him in jail  
And they kept him there  
Hoping so he'd die  
That his body and spirit would waste away  
And soon after that his mind  
  
But every day is born a fool  
One who thinks that he can rule  
One who says tomorrow's mine  
One who wakes one day to find  
  
The prison doors open the shackles broken  
And chaos in the street  
Everybody sing we're free free free free  
Everybody sing we're free free free free  
Everybody sing we're free free free free  
  
They throwed him in jail  
And they kept him there  
Hoping his memory'd die  
That the people forget how he once led  
And fought for justice in their lives  
  
But every day is born a man  
Who hates what he can't understand  
Who thinks the answer is to kill  
Who thinks his actions are god's will  
  
And he thinks he's free free free free  
Yes he thinks he's free free free free  
He thinks he's free free free free  
  
Soon must come the day  
When the righteous have their way  
Unjustly tried are free  
And people live in peace I say  
Give the man release  
Go on and set your conscience free  
Right the wrongs you made  
Even a fool can have his day  
  
Let us all be free free free free  
Let us all be free free free free  
Let us all be free free free free  
  
Free our bodies free our minds  
Free our hearts  
Freedom for everyone  
And freedom now  
Freedom now  
Freedom now  
Freedom now  
  
Let us all be free free free free  
Let us all be free free free free  
Let us all be free free free free  

Give me one reason to stay here  
And I'll turn right back around  
Give me one reason to stay here  
And I'll turn right back around  
Said I don't want leave you lonely  
You got to make me change my mind  
  
Baby I got your number and I know that you got mine  
But you know that I called you, I called too many times  
You can call me baby, you can call me anytime  
You got to call me  
  
Give me one reason to stay here  
And I'll turn right back around  
Give me one reason to stay here  
And I'll turn right back around  
Because I don't want leave you lonely  
you got to make me change my mind  
  
I don't want no one to squeeze me, they might take away my life  
I don't want no one to squeeze me, they might take away my life  
I just want someone to hold me and rock me through the night  
  
This youthful heart can love you and give you what you need  
This youthful heart can love you and give you what you need  
But I'm too old to go chasing you around  
Wasting my precious energy  
  
Give me one reason to stay here  
And I'll turn right back around  
Give me one reason to stay here  
And I'll turn right back around  
Because I don't want leave you lonely  
You got to make me change my mind  
  
Baby just give me one reason, Give me just one reason why  
Baby just give me one reason, Give me just one reason why I should stay  
Said I told you that I loved you  
And there ain't no more to say

No picnic no barbecue out in the back  
A yard for parked cars left to rot and forget  
For chained-up mad dogs for garbage to sit  
Get lost get lost a part from it  
  
[Chorus]  
I can't see through it  
But i can see past  
With me with me always  
Without going back  
  
Just people and buildings  
Not city or town  
Great lake crooked river  
Flat land water burns  
The air not smoke  
It tears the eye  
Home is where you live  
Home is where you'll die  
  
[Chorus]  
  
In a glacial slide  
Over ice mirrored glass  
In a slip and past times  
Are in the future brought back  
Reflected reflected reflected  
Every footstep  
  
No walk in the park  
No there is nowhere  
No place can replace  
What a clear eye reveals  
Soft and hard shaped like a wheel  
Made me of rubber made me of steel  
  
[Chorus]

For you  
It's all in a day  
One day in a life  
It's all in the one word  
The one word is goodbye  
  
For me  
It's all in what you say  
Though you've tried to be kind  
It's all in the words  
From the lips that once touched mine with a sigh  
Goodbye  
  
For you  
It's all in your face  
The laugh and worry lines  
It's all in the one word  
You hope will make you young again  
Goodbye  
  
It's all in the play  
Someone speaks the line  
It's all in the one word  
That stops and steals the time  
Goodbye  
Goodbye  
Goodbye  
  
For me  
It's all in a day  
It's the part in life  
When it's all in the words  
To fate and circumstance resigned  
Goodbye

Should be happy to be loved  
Happy to be  
Unburdened by the thought  
I could still be lonely  
I think you're the one  
Everyone agrees  
But some can see the face of love  
And turn away in disbelief  
  
Every time we get close  
I just run  
And the wind on my face  
Last rays of the sun  
Shine on my skin  
My heart slow me down  
Is all that I can feel  
All that I can feel  
All that I can feel  
All that I can feel  
  
Should be happy to be loved  
Happy to be  
With someone who knows  
And understands me  
I think you're the one  
Everyone agrees  
But some can touch the hand of love  
And pull away in disbelief  
  
Every time we get close  
I just run  
And the wind on my face  
Last rays of the sun  
Shine on my skin  
My heart slow me down  
Is all that I can feel  
All that I can feel  
All that I can feel  
All that I can feel  
  
Should be happy to be loved  
Happy to be  
Possessed by nothing but  
A heart that's chosen freely  
I think you're the one  
Everyone agrees  
But some can feel the grace of love  
And walk away in disbelief  
  
Every time we get close  
I just run  
And the wind on my face  
Last rays of the sun  
Shine on my skin  
My heart slow me down  
Is all that I can feel  
All that I can feel  
All that I can feel  
All that I can feel  
  
All that I can feel  
All that I can feel  
All that I can feel  
All that I can feel  
  
Should be happy to be loved  
Happy to be  
  
Should be happy to be loved  
Happy to be

You can look to the stars in search of the answers  
Look for God and life on distant planets  
Have your faith in the ever after  
While each of us holds inside the map to the labyrinth  
And heaven's here on earth  
  
We are the spirit the collective conscience  
We create the pain and the suffering and the beauty in this world  
Heaven's here on earth  
  
In our faith in humankind  
In our respect for what is earthly  
In our unfaltering belief in peace and love and understanding  
  
I've seen and met angels wearing the disguise  
Of ordinary people leading ordinary lives  
Filled with love, compassion, forgiveness and sacrifice  
Heaven's in our hearts  
  
In our faith in humankind  
In our respect for what is earthly  
In our unfaltering belief in peace and love and understanding  
  
Look around  
Believe in what you see  
The kingdom is at hand  
The promised land is at your feet  
We can and will become what we aspire to be  
If Heaven's here on earth  
  
If we have faith in humankind  
And respect for what is earthly  
And an unfaltering belief that truth is divinity  
And heaven's here on earth  
  
I've seen spirits  
I've met angels  
I've touched creations beautiful and wondrous  
I've been places where I question all I think I know  
But I believe, I believe, I believe this could be heaven  
  
We are born inside the gates with the power to create life  
And to take it away  
The world is our temple  
The world is our church  
Heaven's here on earth  
  
If we have faith in humankind  
And respect for what is earthly  
And an unfaltering belief  
In peace and love and understanding  
This could be heaven here on earth  
  
Heaven's in our heart  

There is a house in new orleans  
They call the rising sun  
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy  
And god i know i'm one  
  
My mother was a tailor  
She sewed my new bluejeans  
My father was a gamblin' man  
Down in new orleans  
  
Now the only thing a gambler needs  
Is a suitcase and trunk  
And the only time he's satisfied  
Is when he's on a drunk  
  
Oh mother tell your children  
Not to do what i have done  
Spend your lives in sin and misery  
In the house of the rising sun  
  
Well, i got one foot on the platform  
The other foot on the train  
I'm goin' back to new orleans  
To wear that ball and chain  
  
Well, there is a house in new orleans  
They call the rising sun  
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy  
And god i know i'm one

When all my hopes and dreams  
Have been betrayed  
I stand before you  
My hands are empty  
  
I am yours, if you are mine  
I am yours, if you are mine  
  
I fall and stumble  
Flat on my face  
And I'm shamed and humble  
In disgrace  
  
I am yours, if you are mine  
I am yours, if you are mine  
  
When voices call me  
To question my faith  
When mis-perception  
Taints my love with hate  
  
I am yours, if you are mine  
I am yours, if you are mine  
  
When time decides  
You won't stop for me  
When the hawks and vultures  
Are circling  
  
I am yours, if you are mine  
I am yours, if you are mine.

A Cosmopolitan, a Manhattan  
Call me one  
Pour a round for me and my friends  
Cape Cod Sea Breeze, Long Island Ice Teas  
I won't go there or drink it if you paid me  
  
When they come to waylay me  
When they close in for the capture  
I did it all  
I did it all  
For the love and the laughter  
I did it all  
I did it all  
I did it all  
  
Slept in late  
Stayed up for days  
Partied hard  
Lived my twenties in haze  
Smoked second-hand in crowded bars  
With the A-list of B-list movie stars  
  
When they come to arrest me  
Pat me down and undress me  
I'll confess without miranda  
Strike a pose for the tabloid cameras  
I did it all  
I did it all  
I did it all  
  
I did it all  
I didn't ask permission  
I did it all  
What kind of life  
Is not an exhibition  
I did it all  
Crash and burn  
And then you know you're living  
I did it all  
Some pain a few tears after  
I did it all  
To the last line of the final chapter  
I did it all  
I did it all  
  
My heat is a wound that festers  
Seduced my share in silk and polyester  
Oh my great loves  
And my few losses  
I'll tell it all  
When my little black book is published  
  
When they come to interview me  
For my made for TV movie  
Say I'm the bitch who was a bastard  
Who did it all for the love and laughter  
I did it all  
I did it all  
I did it all

If not now then when  
If now today then  
Why make your promises  
A love declared for days to come  
Is as good as none  
  
You can wait 'til morning comes  
You can wait for the new day  
You can wait and lose this heart  
You can wait and soon be sorry  
  
Now love's the only thing that's free  
We must take it where it's found  
Pretty soon it may be costly  
  
If now now what then  
We all must live our lives  
Always feeling  
Always thinking  
The moment has arrived

If these are the things that  
Dreams are made of  
Why don't I dream  
Anymore  
I've tried to tell myself  
Nothing's changed my dear  
But I look around me  
And think maybe that's not so  
I only have nightmares  
  
And wake up with cold sweat  
Coming through my pores  
Why don't I dream anymore  
I'm in the garden  
All the trees bear fruit  
I have to pick them before they fall  
I finally grab one  
I hold it in my hand  
I open it up  
  
It's rotten to the core  
Why don't I dream anymore  
If these are the things that  
Dreams are made of  
Why don't I dream  
Anymore  
We lose our patience  
Lose our trust  
Yes we lose our innocence  
  
To forget our sorrow and hide our pain  
We lose old memories  
But dreams are what life's worth living for  
I wish I could dream  
Once more  
I'm in the garden  
All the trees bear fruit  
I have to pick them before they fall  
I finally grab one  
  
I hold it in my hand  
I open it up  
It's rotten to the core  
Why don't I dream anymore  
If these are the things that  
Dreams are made of  
Why don't I dream anymore  
I've tried to tell myself  
It's all for the best my dear  
  
But I look around me and think  
Maybe that's not so  
I only have nightmares  
Wake up in a cold sweat  
Have I become as corrupt  
As all I abhor  
I'm in the garden  
All the trees bear fruit  
I have to pick them before they fall  
I finally grab one  
I hold it in my hand  
  
I open it up  
It's rotten to the core  
Why don't I dream anymore  
If these are the things that  
Dreams are made of  
If these are the things that  
Dreams are made of  
If these are the things that  
Dreams are made of  
I don't want anymore

I want to wake up and know where I'm going  
Say I'm ready  
Say I'm ready  
  
I want to go where the rivers are overflowing and  
I'll be ready  
I'll be ready  
  
I'm ready to let the rivers wash over me  
I'm ready to let the rivers wash over me  
  
If the waters can redeem me  
I'm ready  
I'm ready  
  
I'm ready to let the rivers wash over me  
I'm ready to let the rivers wash over me  
  
I want to wake up  
I want to know where I'm going  
I want to go where the rivers are over-flowing  
  
I'm ready to let the rivers wash over me  
I'm ready  
I'm ready  

Make me fumble  
Make me fall  
Make my heart stop and start  
  
To tremble uncontrollably  
Let my eyes see fear make desire  
Keep those who long apart  
Forbid the kiss  
And leave us innocent  
Of the things some do in the dark  
The things some do in the dark  
The things some do in the dark  
  
Make me remember  
Make me forget  
Make my mind unable  
  
To force the body to do its will  
Let it be right for belief and denial  
To share a space in the heart and leave us only to imagine  
About the things some do in the dark  
The things some do in the dark  
The things some do in the dark  
  
Make me pretend  
Make me expect  
Things can go and come to pass  
  
Without trial or tribulation  
Let this life space and time  
Leave my body with permanent marks  
Faded scars and lines  
But not a single impression  
Of the things some do in the dark  
The things some do in the dark  
The things some do in the dark  
  
Let me be tempted  
Let me be torn  
But make my thoughts pure and not  
  
Morally corrupt in form  
Let us sleep tonight  
Let innocence lie in our dreams and secret hearts  
With burning desire  
A need to know and do  
  
The things some do in the dark  
The things some do in the dark  
The things some do in the dark

You and me  
Had some history  
Had a semblance of honesty  
All that has changed now  
We shared words  
Only lover speak  
How can it be  
We are less than strangers  
  
Oh it hurts to lose in love  
Let anger and cruelty win  
It's unfair that you doubt your feelings  
And that you'll ever love again  
I know that hearts can change  
Like the seasons and the wind  
But when I said forever  
I thought that we'd always be friends  
  
You and me had some history  
Had a semblance of honesty  
All that has changed now  
We shared words  
Only lovers speak  
How can it be  
We are less than strangers  
  
I thought I saw you yesterday  
I thought I passed you on the street  
I swear I saw your face  
I was not imagining  
That you stole a glance my way  
You walked away from me  
My heart it may be broken  
But my eyes are dry to see  
  
You and me had some history  
Had a semblance of honesty  
All that has changed now  
We shared words  
Only lovers speak  
How can it be  
We are less than strangers

The life I've always wanted  
I guess I'll never have  
I'll be working for somebody else  
Until I'm in my grave  
I'll be dreaming of a live of ease  
And mountains Oh mountains o' things  
  
To have a big expensive car  
Drag my furs on the ground  
And have a maid that I can tell  
To bring me anything  
Everyone will look at me with envy and with greed  
I'll revel in their attention  
And mountains Oh mountains o' things  
  
Sweet lazy life  
Champagne and caviar  
I hope you'll come and find me  
Cause you know who we are  
Those who deserve the best in life  
And know what money's worth  
And those whose sole misfortune  
Was having mountains o' nothing at birth  
  
Oh they tell me  
There's still time to save my soul  
They tell me  
Renounce all  
Renounce all those material things you gained by  
Exploiting other human beings  
  
Consume more than you need  
This is the dream  
Make you pauper  
Or make you queen  
I won't die lonely  
I'll have it all prearranged  
A grave that's deep and wide enough  
For me and all my mountains o' things  
  
Mostly I feel lonely  
Good good people are  
Good people are only  
My stepping stones  
It's gonna take all my mountains o' things  
To surround me  
Keep all my enemies away  
Keep my sadness and loneliness at bay  
  
I'll be dreaming, dreaming... Dreaming...

There are locks on the doors  
And chains stretched across all the entries to the inside  
There's a gate and a fence  
And bars to protect from only God knows what lurks outside  
Who stole your heart left you with a space  
That no one and nothing can fill  
Who stole your heart who took it away  
Knowing that without it you can't live  
Who took away the part so essential to the whole  
Left you a hollow body  
Skin and bone  
What robber what thief who stole your heart and the key  
  
Who stole your heart  
The smile from your face  
The innocence the light from your eyes  
Who stole your heart or did you give it away  
And if so then when and why  
Who took away the part so essential to the whole  
Left you a hollow body  
Skin and bone  
What robber what thief  
Who stole your heart and the key  
  
Now all sentiment is gone  
Now you have no trust in no one  
  
Who stole your heart  
Did you know but forget the method and moment in time  
Was it a trickster using mirrors and sleight of hand  
A strong elixir or a potion that you drank  
Who hurt your heart  
Bruised it in a place  
That no one and nothing can heal  
  
You've gone to wizards, princes and magic men  
You've gone to witches, the good the bad the indifferent  
But still all sentiment is gone  
But still you have no trust in no one  
  
If you can tear down the walls  
Throw your armor away remove all roadblocks barricades  
If you can forget there are bandits and dragons to slay  
And don't forget that you defend an empty space  
And remember the tin man  
Found he had what he thought he lacked  
Remember the tin man  
Go find your hear and take it back  
  
Who stole your heart  
Maybe no one can say  
One day you will find it I pray

I know Jesus loves me  
In my heart I know it's true  
I know Mary's little baby  
Came into the world  
Just to save me  
But I don't know about you  
  
My Gods a mighty big God  
My God can shake the world up  
Plagues and famines  
Frogs and locusts  
Walking on water  
Burning bushes  
Rolling the thunder  
And parting the waters too  
  
My God is good in the kitchen  
Make a good meal from bread and fishes  
Feed the hungry pour the wine  
Everybody's welcome to have a good time  
Sit at his table enjoy the food  
  
I know Jesus loves me  
He says I should love you  
My neighbor not his wife  
Don't covet steal kill or lie  
My Gods got a lot of rules  
  
My God made creation  
Six days work one day vacation  
Made a garden  
Filled it with apples  
Adam and Eve walked around natural  
Until they are that one piece of bad fruit  
  
I've heard that your Gods older  
Buddha Allah Krishna  
Manifest with many faces  
Worshiped the world over in foreign places  
I assume your God must love you  
  
I know Jesus loves me  
And my God is good and great and true  
But if pride goeth before the fall  
I hope someones God will save us all  
Save us all  
And love the sinners too

Where are  
The sunny days  
The blue skies  
The flowers for the children  
The colors for their eyes?  
Don't you see  
Don't you see  
All these things now days  
Come in short supply  
It's time that we  
  
It's time that we  
Make a space in our hearts  
And open our eyes  
Where are  
All the sandy beaches  
Fishes in the sea  
Birds to sing for daybreak?  
Where are all the trees?  
Don't you see  
Don't you see  
  
All these things now days  
Come in short supply  
It's time that we  
It's time that we  
Make a space in our hearts  
And open our eyes  
Where are all the grassy hilltops  
Clean air to breathe  
Pure water to drink of  
  
Beautiful sights to see?  
Don't you see  
Don't you see  
All these things now days  
Come in short supply  
It's time that we  
It's time that we  
Make a space in our hearts  
And open our eyes  
Or there'll be no more you  
  
There'll be no more me  
There'll be no more children  
All we know will cease to be  
Don't you see  
Don't you see  
The things of this earth  
Keep us alive  
It's time that we  
  
It's time that we  
Make a space in our hearts  
And open our eyes  
Where are the sunny days?  
Blue skies  
The flowers for the children  
All the colors for their eyes  
All the sandy beaches  
Fishes in the sea  
  
All the birds to sing for daybreak  
Where are  
Where are  
Where are all the trees?  
Don't you see  
All these things they come in short supply  
It's time that we  
Make a space inside our hearts  
And open our eyes

I'd heard rumors and I'd heard talk  
About the trail you'd left of broken hearts  
About the sea of tears too wide to cross  
But a little bad press has never scared me off  
So I burned a path to figure out  
How to get me some of what you got  
  
I've got a red hot heart  
If the talk is true yours is the same  
And we should be together  
And let our passions fan love's flame  
  
When I looked for you I almost passed you by  
You were so cool and calm  
I thought my friends had lied  
But I thought so much reserve must make you wild inside  
It was there and then that I knew  
I had to get some of what you got  
  
I've got a red hot heart  
If the talk is true yours is the same  
And we should be together  
And let our passions fan love's flame  
  
I thought I'd won your heart when I held you hand in mine  
I thought it was true love the way we complemented each other  
But my right is your wrong  
And when you're right then I'm left with nothing  
Your light and your heat have all been spent  
Leaving only smoke and ashes  
Only smoke and ashes baby  
  
I've got a red hot heart  
And your heart's as blue as the blood in your veins  
I say there's fire down below  
You say it's only smoke and ashes baby  
  
I'm crying all the time  
Salty stinging tears  
And mourning for the past carbon-dated years  
But knowing now for certain that you were always right  
Because if a breeze could blow you out of my life  
It's only smoke and ashes baby  
Only smoke and ashes baby  
  
I've got a red hot heart  
And your heart's as blue as the blood in your veins  
I say there's fire down below  
You say it's only smoke and ashes baby  
  
I was blinded by devotion  
My unwavering love for you  
So blinded that I thought all your lies were true  
But now I know for certain since you've gone away  
It was just a smoldering fire I mistook for a blaze  
Only smoke and ashes baby  
  
I've got a red hot heart  
And your heart's as blue as the blood in your veins  
I say there's fire down below  
You say it's only smoke and ashes baby  
Only smoke and ashes baby, baby  

Unsettled hearts  
Promise what they can't deliver  
Bring me the wine  
And the cold night air to clear my head  
Gray matter memory house  
Master of this trembling flesh  
Steady still my doubts  
Let me speak the word that precedes bliss  
Let me speak the word  
Let me speak the word  
  
Love love love love love love love love  
  
Let me speak the word  
Let me speak the word  
  
Love love love love love love love love  
  
Let me speak the word  
Let me speak the word  
  
Let me speak the word  
Let me speak the word  
  
These weakened knees  
Have not touched ground or pew in ages  
I haven't bowed my head  
I offer thanks to any god or to ask for favors  
But watch me now  
I'm falling down  
Praying  
To speak the word that precedes bliss  
To speak the word  
To speak the word  
  
Love love love love love love love love  
  
Let me speak the word  
Let me speak the word  
  
Love love love love love love love love  
  
Let me speak the word  
Let me speak the word  
  
Let me speak the word  
Let me speak the word  

People say it doesn't exist  
'Cause no one would like to admit  
That there is a city underground  
Where people live everyday  
Off the waste and decay  
Off the discards of their fellow man  
  
Here in subcity life is hard  
We can't receive any government relief  
I'd like to please give Mr. President my honest regards  
For disregarding me  
  
They say there's too much crime in these city streets  
My sentiments exactly  
Government and big business hold the purse strings  
When I worked I worked in the factories  
I'm at the mercy of the world  
I guess I'm lucky to be alive  
  
They say we've fallen through the cracks  
They say the system works  
But we won't let it help  
I guess they never stop to think  
We might not just want handouts  
But a way to make an honest living  
Living this ain't living  
  
What did I do deserve this  
Had my trust in god  
Worked everyday of my life  
Thought I had some guarantees  
That's what I thought  
At least that's what I thought  
  
Last night I had another restless sleep  
Wondering what tomorrow might bring  
Last night I dreamed  
A cold blue light was shining down on me  
I screamed myself awake  
Thought I must be dying  
Thought I must be dying  

Should I try to take you in?  
Another fool brought to the fold  
With not a gaze or arms  
but deathlike grip to hold  
To hold [Repeat: x3]  
  
Should I try to take you in?  
And hope for the perfect docile pet  
Hope that you'll not defile or wreck my home  
Sweet home [Repeat: x3]  
  
[Chorus]  
Here there's only faith no doubt  
You can be taken anywhere  
Here is where you choose the place  
With pleasure and pain in equal share  
A refuge for truth and deceit  
Where all who come are taken in  
  
Should I try to take you in?  
Pretending what you have not felt  
In passion sorrow sleep or death eyes closed  
Eyes closed [Repeat: x3]  
  
Here there's only faith no doubt  
You can be taken anywhere  
Here is where you choose the place  
With pleasure and pain in equal share  
A refuge for truth and deceit  
Where all who come are taken in  
  
Should I try to take you in  
Who'll pity me if I forget?  
It's said to be and not to be in love  
Is to regret  
Regret [Repeat: x3]  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Should I try to take you in  
Who'll pity me in my regret?  
For those who've never been in love  
Need not forget  
Forget  
Forget

Gotta talk to you baby  
Talk to you now  
Maybe it's too late  
You're slamming the door  
You're walking out  
  
[Chorus]  
I got a feeling  
Feelings don't lie  
Don't let the words escape me now  
Escape me now  
Escape me now  
  
Gotta talk to you baby  
Talk to you now  
Say it isn't too late  
You'll see me again  
We'll work it out  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Gotta talk to you baby  
Talk to you now  
Say it isn't too soon  
You'll see me again  
We'll sort it out  
  
[Chorus]

There would be psalms sung by a choir  
I would have a white robe a halo newly acquired  
I'd be at peace and I'd have no desire  
If I'd lived right  
  
There would be cherubs with tiny harps arrows and bows  
I'd have a halo and a flowing white robe  
I'd be enfolded by a celestial light  
If I'd lived right  
  
But I'm feeling hot and bothered under the collar  
I feel the sweat breaking out on my brow  
I feel the heat and I know it's the passion  
The love I can't disavow  
  
If this is a dream wake me up now  
If this is a movie let's edit these scenes out  
It would be a PG instead of an X-rated life  
If I'd lived right  
  
Some would call me a cheat call me a liar  
Say that I've been defeated by the basest desired  
Yes I have strayed and succumbed to my vices  
But I tried to live right  
  
But I have no regrets no guilt in my heart  
I only feel sadness for any pain that I've caused  
I guess I wouldn't bother to worry at all  
If I'd lived right  
  
Do you live by the book do you play by the rules?  
Do you care what is thought by others about you?  
If this day is all that is promised to you  
Do you life for the future the present the past?  
  
If there is one thing I know I know I will die  
If anyone cares some stranger my critique my life  
I may be revered or defamed and decried  
But I tried to live right  
  
There would be psalms sung by a choir  
I would have a white robe a halo newly acquired  
I'd be at peace and I'd have no desire  
If I'd lived right  

I've been having dreams and visions  
In them you are always standing  
Right beside me  
I reach out for your hand  
To see your arms extending  
outstretched towards me  
  
For you I don the veil  
By your light  
Others pale by comparison  
I place my faith in love  
My fate in this communion  
  
I've been having dreams and visions  
In them you are always standing  
Right beside me  
I reach out for your hand  
To see your arms extending  
Outstretched towards me  
  
To you I give my pledge  
I honor all that's good  
In this life we're living  
To think not only of myself  
But of the greater union  
  
Can I get a witness  
There is salvation and rapture for the lonely  
Can I get a witness  
Bless this day sacred and holy  
Sacred and Holy  
  
I've been having dreams and visions  
In them you are always standing  
Right beside me  
I reach out for your hand  
To see your arms extending  
Outstretched towards me  
  
With you I am revealed  
All my shame all my faults and virtues  
Behold body mind and spirit  
Heart and soul devoted all to you  
  
Can I get a witness  
There is salvation and rapture for the lonely  
Can I get a witness  
Bless this day sacred and holy  
Sacred and Holy  

Some say you're crazy  
Say that you're no good  
Say your family's cursed with bad blood  
But I think you're cute and misunderstood  
And I wouldn't change you if I could  
  
Let' em talk you down  
Call you names  
My mind's made up  
It ain't gonna change  
I'm sure in my heart  
Happy and free  
You're the one  
You're the one  
You're the one for me  
  
Some say you're bitter  
Think you're mean  
Uncouth untamed and unrestrained  
But I think you're sensitive and sweet  
Stay as you are  
Don't change a thing  
  
Let' em talk you down  
Call you names  
My mind's made up  
It ain't gonna change  
I'm sure in my heart  
Happy and free  
You're the one  
You're the one  
You're the one for me  
  
Some say you're bawdy  
Wicked and wild  
A restless useless juvenile  
But I think you're funny and I like your smile  
Want to be with you  
Want you to stay a while  
  
Let' em talk you down  
Call you names  
My mind's made up  
It ain't gonna change  
I'm sure in my heart  
Happy and free  
You're the one  
You're the one  
You're the one for me  
  
A no count mixed up  
Amount to nothing  
A day away from a bum on the street  
Some low class kind of royalty  
That's what they say about you  
When they're talking to me  
  
Some say you're bad  
A bad bad seed  
You love to play with fire you love gambling  
But I know what you love and I know what you need  
And I like it when you play with me  
  
Let' em talk you down  
Call you names  
My mind's made up  
It ain't gonna change  
I'm sure in my heart  
Happy and free  
You're the one  
You're the one  
You're the one for me  
  
I'm sure in my heart  
Happy and free  
You're the one  
You're the one  
You're the one for me
