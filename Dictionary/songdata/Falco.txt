Zwei drei vier one two three  
Its easy to see  
But its not that I don't care so  
Cause I hear it all the time  
But they never let you know  
On the TV and the radio  
She was young her heart was pure  
But every night is bright she got  
She said sugar is sweet  
She come rappin' to the beat  
Then I knew that she was hot  
  
She was singin  
Don't turn around, oh oh  
Der Kommissar's in town, oh oh  
You're in his eye  
And you'll know why  
The more you live  
The faster you will die  
  
Alles klar, Herr Kommissar?  
  
She said babe you know  
I miss Jill and Joe  
And all my funky friends  
But my street understanding  
was just enough to know what she really meant  
And I got to thinking while she was talking  
That I know she told the story  
Of those special places that she goes  
When she rides with the others in the subway  
  
Singin'  
Don't turn around, oh oh  
Der Kommissar's in town, oh oh  
And if he talks to you  
And you don't know why  
You say your life  
Is gonna make you die...  
  
Alles klar, Herr Kommissar?  
  
Well we meet Jill and Joe  
And brother Herr  
And the whole cool gang (and oh)  
They're rappin' here they're rappin' there  
But she's climbin' on the wall  
Its a clear case, Herr Kommissar  
Cause all the children know  
They're all slidin' down into the valley  
They're all slipping on the same snow  
  
Hear the children  
Don't turn around, oh oh  
Der Kommissar's in town, oh oh  
He's got the power  
And you're so weak  
And you're frustration will not let you speak  
  
Don't turn around, oh oh  
Der Kommissar's in town, oh oh  
And if he talks to you  
Then you'll know why  
The more you live  
The faster you will die  
  
Don't turn around, oh oh  
Der Kommissar's in town, oh oh  
(repeat x5)

In the mornin' you go gunnin'  
For the man who stole your water  
And you fire 'till he is done in  
But they catch you at the border  
And the mourners are all singin'  
As they drag you by your feet  
But the hangman isn't hangin'  
So they put you on the street  
  
[Chorus:]  
You go back, Jack  
Do it again  
Wheel' turnin' round and 'round  
You go back, Jack  
Do it again  
  
When you know she's no climber  
Then you find your only friend  
In a room with your two timer  
And you're sure you're near the end  
Then you love a little wild one  
And she brings you only sorrow  
And all the time you know she's smilin'  
You'll be the one on your knees tomorrow  
  
[Chorus:]  
Do gehst back, back  
Do it again  
Wheel's turnin' round and round  
Do gehst back, back  
Do it again  
  
Now your swear and kick and beg us  
That you're not a gambling man  
Then you find you're back in Vegas  
With a handle in your hand  
Your black cards can make you money  
So you hide them when you're able  
In the land of milk and honey  
You must put them on the table  
  
You go back, Jack  
Do it again  
Das Rad Umschliesst den Kreis  
Und do gehst back, back  
Do it again

These are the given lyrics for this song, but to my ears,  
Most of the first verse sounds to me to be in German.  
This is the story of a lonely man  
Who's seen the world  
From japan to Afghanistan  
Hey! ho!  
  
Everybody thought that I was gone for good  
But I'm back, understood  
Hey! ho!  
  
I've been through the snow and the storm  
Felt the cold  
No one to keep me warm  
Agony and pain  
  
Falco rides again, bang bang  
I won't break  
I won't bend  
Falco rides again  
It's me and my gang  
I came back just like a boomerang  
I'll fight 'till the end  
Falco rides again  
I've been up, I've been down  
I've been pushed around  
Beated, mistreated,  
Gagged and bound  
Hey! ho!  
  
Not a soul in the world thought I would survive  
Took every muscle in my body to stay alive  
Hey! ho!  
I'll break down the walls  
No more defeat  
I want the taste of victory  
Revenge is sweet  
  
Rides again!

Where can you find pleasure, search the world for treasure, learn science
technology?  
Where can you begin to make your dreams all come true on the land or on the
sea?  
Where can you learn to fly, play in sports or skindive, study oceanography?  
Sign up for the big band or sit in the grandstand when your team and others
meet.  
  
Chorus  
In the navy, you can sail the seven seas  
In the navy, you can put your mind at ease  
In the navy, come on now people, make a stand  
In the navy, can't you see we need a hand?  
In the navy, come protect the mother land  
In the navy, come on and join your fellow man  
In the navy, come on people make a stand  
Inthe navy, in the navy  
  
They want you! They want you! They want you as a new recruit!  
  
If you like adventure, don't you wait to enter, the recruiting office fast  
Don't you hesitate, there is no need to wait, they're signing up new seamen
fast  
Maybe you are too young to sign up today, but don't you worry 'bout a thing  
For I'm sure there will always be a good navy, protecting the land and sea  
  
Chorus  
  
They want you! They want you! They want you as a new recruit! X2  
  
... But, but I'm afraid of water  
... Hey... Hey look men  
I get seasick even watching it on the tv  
They want you! - oh my goodness  
They want you! - what am I gonna do on a submarine?  
They want you! They want you!  
In the navy  
  
Chorus

That's underground  
And fly  
Macho Macho  
I don't like your style  
Macho Macho  
You'll be floatin' on the river Nile  
Macho Macho  
So get down on your knees and pray  
Macho Macho  
I'm gonna blow your Macho Macho mind away, away  
And the boys are singin'  
Na - na - na - na - na  
Hip, hip  
Na - na - na - na - na  
So listen  
I heard a story the other day  
And I've been wonderin' what they got to say  
They said you took ma lady for a ride  
They said it lasted to the morning light  
So listen  
I am not a violent boy  
But you touched my lady and she's my  
Favourite toy  
And you're  
Macho Macho  
Fade out  
The boys don't sing anymore  

Confusion  
Desillution  
No Time  
No time for revolution  
No time for revolution  
Elutions for dath romance could breakup the bugs  
You go on makin' sense  
Back in the sixties: they standed there  
"Fight, fight for the dreams, fight for the right"  
In the seventies: follow, follow to go over to the place  
So went to San Francisco, somewhere far out the space  
In the eighties: I don't know, some did it for the money,  
Some did it for the showthere's no time  
No time to remember these days  
No time to hold back in that size  
We don't have no time, no time, no time...  
No time for revolution (4 times)In the nineties: there's a soul called those
generation  
For who is in charge for this situation and this station  
About politicians, no embitions - tell me what's the vision  
To be a winner, is never ever mather of how,  
Political correctness is the word of now  
The spirit of the money is the sound of the time  
There's something coming up to change your mindthere's no time...

Yah,  
Yah,  
Yahlah,  
They say there is religion  
There is a kind of taste  
Get me the celebration  
And I will give you the waste  
There will be no danger  
No trouble at all  
We need a stand-up together  
Those curtains are not to fall  
Arabian nights  
Arabian nights  
There's no way out for me  
This dream will capture me for years  
Yellow night light  
In a city of white  
I'm stranded in the desert  
I'm stranded in a fight  
Arabian nights  
Arabian  
Arabian nights  
There's no way out for me  
This dream will capture me for years  
Yellow night light  
In a city of white  
I'm stranded in the desert  
I'm stranded in a fight  
There's no one here who's  
Gonna safe you [should probably be "save"]  
There's nothin' sweeter than Arabia  
There's no way out for me  
This dream will capture me too far  
In a city of white  
I'm stranded in the desert  
I'm stranded  
En-cha-la  
Arabian nights  
A-RA-BI-A  
There's nothin' sweeter than Arabia  

If your blue and you don't know where to go to  
Why don't you go where fashion sits  
Puttin on the ritz.  
  
Different types of wear all day coat pants  
With stripes and cut away coats for perfect fits  
Puttin on the Ritz.  
  
Dressed up like a million dollar trooper  
Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper  
Super-Duper  
  
Come lets mix where Rockafellers  
Walk with sticks or umbrellas  
In thier mits  
Puttin on the Ritz.  
  
Have you seen the well to do  
Up and down Park Avenue  
On that famous thorough fare  
With thier noses in the air  
High hats and narrow collars  
White spats and lots of dollars  
Spending every dime  
For a wonderful time.  
  
If your blue and you don't know where to go to  
Why don't you go where fashion sits  
Puttin on the ritz.  
  
Different types of wear all day coat pants  
With stripes and cut away coats for perfect fits  
Puttin on the Ritz.

Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper

Come lets mix where Rockafellers  
Walk with sticks or umbrellas  
In thier mits  
Puttin on the Ritz.

Dressed up like a million dollar trooper  
Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper

Why don't you go where fashion sits  
Puttin on the ritz.

Ooh rock me Amadeus  
Rock me Amadeus  
Rock rock rock rock me Amadeus  
Rock me all the time to the top  
  
He was a punker  
And he lived in the big city  
It was Vienna, was Vienna  
Where he did everything  
He had debts, for he drank  
But all the women loved him  
And each one shouted:  
Come on and rock me Amadeus  
  
[Chorus:]  
Amadeus Amadeus, Amadeus  
Amadeus Amadeus, Amadeus  
Amadeus Amadeus, oh oh oh Amadeus  
  
He was a superstar  
He was popular  
He was so exalted  
Because he had flair  
He was a virtuoso  
Was a rock idol  
And everyone shouted:  
Come on and rock me Amadeus  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Come on and rock me Amadeus  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It was around 1780  
And it was in Vienna  
No plastic money anymore  
The banks against him  
From which his debts came  
It was common knowledge  
He was a woman's man  
Women loved his punk  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Come and rock me Amadeus  
  
Baby baby do it to me rock me  
Baby baby do it to me rock me  
Baby baby do it to me rock me  
Yes yes yes  
Baby baby do it to me rock me  
Baby baby do it to me rock me  
Baby baby do it to me rock me  
  
[Chorus]

And we are growing along spiritual lines  
Will never mean we should stop to have big fun time  
Oh oh oh  
Should it be for the very first of all to pray  
And to report it to your next in an effective way  
  
But whatever our ideals turn to be  
We must be willing to break it through  
We must be willing to make amends where we  
Ever have to put some harm on too  
  
She is my she's my all  
She is my all surrounding solid booze you know  
She is my all surrounding solid booze you knowShe is my all surrounding solid
booze you know  
  
And we are growing along the spiritual lines  
Would never mean we should believe in all thoseDifferent kinds  
Oh oh oh  
Could it be the very first of all to recognize  
Its the better sense to take it once and give it twice  
  
But whatever our ideals turn out to be  
We should be willing to break it through  
We should be willing to realizeThat attitudes have got us too  
  
She is my  
She's my all

Train sounds and coughing I always take the 7:30 AM train  
Going to Brasil City  
Well, at this hour of the day, I'm not too well humored  
'Cause life doesn't show any pity  
You're always complaining 'bout yourself  
And putting things down in the world  
Just take a good look at Kathleen Turner  
Now there's one heck of a girl  
  
I've been to hell and back but I'm alright Jack  
Now I know what love is about  
Under the seven moons  
I made a solemn vow  
I need the kiss of Kathleen Turner right now  
I need the kiss of Kathleen Turner right now  
Smack! In the middle  
  
Female voice on telephone: "Hello?"  
"Oh it's me, I know it's late  
But I just had to call you  
I'll be over real soon"  
  
"Kathleen Kathleen"  
  
Is this a dream, or is it real  
Is this really happening to me  
Or is this just fantasy?  
In this world there's only one woman  
Who can make my dreams my dreams come true  
And that woman Kathleen  
It's you  
  
Standing on the corner watching all the girls go by  
He wants a kiss  
Not just one, I want lots of kisses  
He wants a kiss  
Standing on the corner watching all the girls go by  
He wants a kiss  
  
Hallelujah, he's in love  
Hallelujah, glory, glory

Kathleen, do you know what I'm talking about  
I'm just talking about  
Not the first kiss of my life  
I'm talking about, our planet  
Kathleen!

We fell in love on a hot summer night  
I looked at her she at me  
Love at first sight  
I made a lover's vow  
She'd be mine  
I said I'd love her 'till the end of time  
And when she said  
Does it feel good  
Does it feel fine  
I said yeah yeah yeah  
  
Do bist der star unserer tage  
Do und ich, no way back, keine frage  
You're the lucky one  
The star of moon and sun  
  
Love is a strange phenomenon  
It makes you happy, sad, it's never fun  
Boy meets girl, heart meets heart  
Like tigers, they tear each other apart  
But when you say does it feel good  
Does it feel fine  
I say yeah yeah yeah  
  
Do bist der star unserer tage  
Do und ich, no way back, keine frage  
You're the lucky one  
The star of moon and sun

Falkenhorstbeen and seen down flight from Chicago  
All aboard the African Queen  
I am on a night boat down to Cairofeeling like a tourist with a foreign man
abroad  
Tells it like he thinks it is, but I know he is fraud  
There is a map tucked under his shoulder  
And a cap perched on his head  
If he looked any older, he might as well be deaddressed in army surplus the
files around me swarm  
On a mission without a purpose, I wish I'd never been bornby the light of a
pale moon - Tutankhamen  
Half past high noon - Tutankhamenput you in the picture - 1884  
I'm up to date on the literature  
But I have never been here beforethere is a black boy on the corner trailing
me behind  
Stalking like a vulture money on his mind  
In the shadow of the giant sphinx the archeological tale  
Before the eastern sun sinks I'll be learning brailleby the light of a pale
moon - Tutankhamen  
Half past high noon - Tutankhamen  
They are playing our tune - Tutankhamen  
Half past high noon - Tutankhamenby the light of a, light of a pale moon -
Tutankhamen  
Half past high noon - Tutankhamen  
By the light of a pale moon - Tutankhamen  
Half past high noon - Tutankhamen

She's not just another pretty face in a magazine  
This girl is real - She's every schoolboy's dream  
She fills my fantasies, my eyes and my ears  
But every time I try to touch her - She disappears  
Oh oh oh oh oh She's untouchable  
Oh oh oh oh oh untouchable delight  
Oh oh oh oh oh She's untouchable  
Oh oh oh oh oh She's outta- sight  
In my mind I'm always with her - moans and sighs  
I touch her full red lips - her silken thighs  
We meet in the city, she begs, "please take me home"  
But when I wake up in a cold sweat: I'm all alone
