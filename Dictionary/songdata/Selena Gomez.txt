[Verse 1]  
Dead-end streets and boulevards  
You threw in the towel, I broke your heart  
But there's a first time for everything  
Who would've thought you'd feel so cold  
And all these memories seem so old  
To think you were my everything  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Remember when we'd talk all night  
But time ain't easy on us, how can love die?  
  
[Chorus]  
I got so much shit to say  
But I can't help feeling like I'm camouflage  
Fortress around my heart  
You were mine just yesterday  
Now I have no idea who you are  
It's like you camouflage  
  
[Post-Chorus]  
But it's good to see you here again  
I don't wanna say goodbye  
But it's about half past ten  
And I have to catch my ride  
  
[Verse 2]  
Riding alone on the 405  
And life's so fragile, it's like I could cry  
If that's the last time I'd see you again  
But I'll never tell you just how I felt  
You might just not care, and it might just not help  
What if the feelings just don't make no sense to you, you  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Remember when we'd talk all night  
But time ain't easy on us, how can love die?  
  
[Chorus]  
I got so much shit to say  
But I can't help feeling like I'm camouflage  
Fortress around my heart  
You were mine just yesterday  
Now I have no idea who you are  
It's like you camouflage  
  
[Post-Chorus]  
But it's good to see you here again  
I don't wanna say goodbye  
But it's about half past ten  
And I have to catch my ride  
  
[Chorus]  
I got so much shit to say  
But I can't help feeling like I'm camouflage  
Fortress around my heart  
You were mine just yesterday  
Now I have no idea who you are  
It's like you camouflage  
  
[Post-Chorus]  
But it's good to see you here again  
I don't wanna say goodbye  
But it's about half past ten  
And I have to catch my ride

[Verse 1]  
There's a reason you're everywhere  
Breathe you in like you're in the air  
Maybe you should call off the day  
Give your girl some time to play  
In my room, from the ceiling to the floor  
My body knows that you've been here before  
  
[Chorus]  
Every second here without you, I pretend we're skin to skin  
Every single breath reminds me that you never, ever left  
Every time I think about you, I can feel my hand give in  
Cause you're keeping me safe and warm  
Even when I'm home alone  
Wearing nothing but your cologne  
  
[Verse 2]  
Maybe you should call off the day  
Give your girl some time to play  
Running my mind cause my heart lost all control  
Only one thing that can give me that multiple  
  
[Chorus]  
Every second here without you, I pretend we're skin to skin  
Every single breath reminds me that you never, ever left  
Every time I think about you, I can feel my hand give in  
Cause you're keeping me safe and warm  
Even when I'm home alone  
Wearing nothing but your cologne  
Wearing nothing but your cologne  
Wearing nothing but your cologne, cologne  
Wearing nothing but your cologne  
  
[Bridge]  
All the way down  
Feels like you're around  
Forever in the moment  
I love it, and you know it  
All the way down  
Feels like you're around  
Forever in the moment  
I love it, and you know it  
  
[Chorus]  
Every second here without you, I pretend we're skin to skin  
Every single breath reminds me that you never, ever left  
Every time I think about you, I can feel my hand give in  
Cause you're keeping me safe and warm  
Even when I'm home alone  
Wearing nothing but your cologne  
Wearing nothing but your cologne  
Wearing nothing but your cologne, cologne  
Wearing nothing but your cologne  
Wearing nothing but your cologne

I guess I should've known  
It wasn't gonna end okay,  
You're such a trouble maker  
But I like you just that way.  
  
A bomb tick ticking with me  
The one I'd best to blame  
Just like I can't tell  
And I'm ready to blow  
I sat around a lot and thought  
About the world without you  
And no matter what you think,  
Everything is not about you  
You think I'm still hung up on you  
But baby it's not true  
  
Now look at me  
Your memories're turning to dust  
There's only one explanation  
I wasn't really in love  
(I wasn't really in love)  
It was just a crush  
It was just a crush  
Sparks fly when we touch  
It was never enough  
It was just a crush  
It was just a crush  
Yeah  
  
You found one the things you need  
There's nothing left to lose  
The things I never wanna be  
I owe it all to you  
You just can't help yourself  
It's what you do  
Cause this is real life  
Not your show  
  
Now look at me  
The memories turn to dust  
There's only one explanation  
I wasn't really in love  
(I wasn't really in love)  
It was just a crush  
It was just a crush  
Sparks fly when we touched  
It was never enough  
It was just a crush  
It was just a crush  
Yeah,  
  
You'll be fine,  
Just find another girl  
To kick around  
Won't be long  
Until they all know what  
I figured out  
  
Now look at me  
Memories turn to dust  
There's only one explanation  
I wasn't really in love  
(I wasn't really in love)  
It was just a crush  
(It just was a crush)  
Sparks fly when we touched  
It was never enough  
It was just a crush  
It was just a crush (It was just a crush)  
Yeah  
(It was just a crush)  
It was just a crush  
Yeah.

I told, I told, I told myself again  
I'm never running back on what I said  
Trying not to run but you're so far away  
So far away  
Won't listen to the conscience in my head  
I'm conscious but I'm lonely halfway dead  
Tired of the thing you never, you never said  
You never said  
  
Our love was made to rule the world  
You came and broke the perfect girl  
Our love was made to rule the world  
Our love was made to rule the world  
You left me wanting what we were  
Our love was made to rule the world  
  
Forget forever  
Forget forever  
Forget you ever knew my name, my name, my name, my name  
  
I know, I know, I know we can't pretend  
That we never lovers in the end  
I tried to tell myself that this pain would go away  
Just go away  
  
Our love was made to rule the world  
You came and broke the perfect girl  
Our love was made to rule the world  
Our love was made to rule the world  
You left me wanting what we were  
Our love was made to rule the world  
  
Forget forever  
Forget forever  
Forget you ever knew my name, my name, my name, my name  
  
Our love was made to rule the world  
You came and broke the perfect girl  
Our love was made to rule the world  
  
Forget forever  
Forget forever  
Forget you ever knew my name, my name, my name, my name  
Forget forever  
Forget forever

It's the boy you never told I like you,  
It's the girl you let get away.  
It's the one you saw that day on the train,  
But you freaked out and walked away.  
  
It's the plane you wanna catch to Vegas,  
Things you swear you'll do before you die,  
It's the city of love that waits for you,  
But you're to damn scared to fly.  
  
Hit the lights, let the music move you, lose yourself tonight,  
Come alive, let the moment take you, lose control tonight.  
Hit the lights, let the music move you, lose yourself tonight,  
Come alive, let the moment take you, lose control tonight.  
  
It's the time that you totally screwed up,  
Still you're trying to get it out your brain.  
It's the fight you had when you didn't make up,  
It's the past that you're dying to change.  
It's all the money that you're saving,  
While the good life passes by.  
It's all the dreams that never came true,  
Cause you're too damn scared to try. (Scared to try.)  
  
Hit the lights, let the music move you, lose yourself tonight,  
Come alive, let the moment take you, lose control tonight.  
Hit the lights, let the music move you, lose yourself tonight,  
Come alive, let the moment take you, lose control tonight.  
  
It's a mad, mad world, gotta make an escape,  
It's a perfect world, when you go all the way.  
Hit the lights, let the music move you, lose yourself tonight.  
  
So let's go, go, go, go all the way.  
Yeah let's go, go, go, go night and day.  
From the floor, to the rafters, people raise your glasses,  
We could dance forever!  
  
Hit the lights, let the music move you, lose yourself tonight,  
Come alive, let the moment take you, lose control tonight.  
It's a mad, mad world, gotta make an escape.  
It's a perfect world, when you go all the way.  
Hit the lights, let the music move you, lose yourself tonight.

I know  
That my love for  
You is real  
It's somethin' true  
That we do  
Just somethin' natural  
That I feel  
When you walk in the room  
When you're near  
I feel my heart skips a beat  
The whole world disappears  
And there's just you and me  
Falling head over feet  
Let's take a chance, together  
  
[Chorus]  
I know, I know, I know, I know,  
We're gonna make it  
Cause no one else can  
Make me feel the way that you do  
I promise you  
I know, I know, I know, I know,  
We're gonna get there  
Today, tomorrow,  
And forever we will stay true  
I promise you  
  
They say,  
That we're just too young to know,  
But I'm sure heart and soul  
That I'm never letting you go  
When it's right, it's right  
And this is it  
'Cause I'm walking on air  
Every single time that we kiss  
You make the angels sing  
You give the songbird wings  
You make everything better  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'll never let you down  
I'll always hear you out  
There is nothing you can mount,  
Come and fight  
You listen when I speak  
You make my knees go weak  
And I just want you by side  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We're gonna make  
I promise you, yeah, yeah, yeah  
I promise you  
I promise you  
I promise you

Now's all we got and time can't be bought.  
I know it inside my heart forever will forever be ours.  
Even if we try to forget, love will remember.  
  
You said you love me, I said I loved you back  
What happened to that, what happened to that  
All your promises, and all them plans we had,  
What happened to that, what happened to that  
Boom gone, yeah we move on, even if we try to forget,  
  
Love will remember you, love will remember me  
I know it inside of my heart,  
Forever will forever be ours, even if we try to forget,  
Love will remember, love will remember  
Love will remember, love will remember, love will remember  
  
The trips we dreamed of taking the tacks left on the map,  
What happened to that, what happened to that  
When all you had was nothing, and all we did was laugh  
What happened to that, what happened, what happened to that  
Boom gone, yeah we move on, even if we try to forget  
  
Love will remember you, love will remember me  
I know it inside of my heart,  
Forever will forever be ours, even if we try to forget,  
Love will remember, love will remember  
Love will remember, love will remember, love will remember  
  
Break down the walls let heaven in, somewhere and forever we'll dance again,  
We used to be inseparable, I used to think that I was irreplaceable  
We lit the whole world up, before we blew it up,  
I still don't know just how we screwed it up  
Forever, forever, forever  
  
Love will remember you, love will remember me  
I know it inside of my heart,  
Forever will forever be ours, even if we try to forget,  
Love will remember, love will remember

Love will remember, love will remember, love will remember, love'll remember

It's been said and done  
Every beautiful thought's been already sung  
And I guess right now here's another one  
So your melody will play on and on, with the best of 'em  
You are beautiful, like a dream come alive, incredible  
A centerfold, a miracle, lyrical  
You've saved my life again  
And I want you to know baby  
  
[Chorus]  
I, I love you like a love song, baby  
I, I love you like a love song, baby  
I, I love you like a love song, baby  
And I keep it in re-pe-pe-peat  
I, I love you like a love song, baby  
I, I love you like a love song, baby  
I, I love you like a love song, baby  
And I keep it in re-pe-pe-peat  
  
Constantly, boy you played through my mind like a symphony  
There's no way to describe what you do to me  
You just do to me, what you do  
And it feels like I've been rescued  
I've been set free, I am hypnotized by your destiny  
You are magical, lyrical, beautiful  
You are, and I want you to know baby  
  
[Chorus]  
  
No one compares  
You stand alone, to every record I own  
Music to my heart that's what you are  
  
[Chorus]

Oh, oh, oh  
It's magic, you know  
Never believe it's not so  
It's magic, you know  
Never believe, it's not so  
  
Never been awake  
Never seen a day break  
Leaning on my pillow in the morning light  
Lazy day in bed  
Music in my head  
Crazy music playing in the morning light  
  
Oh, oh, oh  
It's magic, you know  
Never believe it's not so  
It's magic, you know  
Never believe, it's not so  
  
I love my sunny day  
Dream of far away  
Dreaming on my pillow in the morning light  
Never been awake  
Never seen a day break  
Laying on my pillow in the morning light  
  
Oh, oh, oh  
It's magic, you know  
Never believe it's not so  
It's magic, you know  
Never believe, it's not so  
  
Oh, oh, oh  
It's magic, you know  
Never believe it's not so  
It's magic, you know  
Never believe, it's not so

Just drive I'm sick of talkin',  
We know where this is going,  
I'm done take me home,home,  
I can't wait forever,  
For you to get yourself together.  
I'd rather be alone,  
  
I'm so tired of pretending,  
Just want a happy ending,  
  
[Chorus]  
Wish I could put a spell on you,  
Wish I could make you feel like I do,  
Wouldn't that be sweet so magical,  
Wish I could blink and wave a wand,  
Get everything that I ever wanted,  
And put a spell on you,  
And make it all come true,  
  
You taught me what I know,  
Guys like you come and go,  
But I know things can change  
  
See my heart it may be broken,  
But that wont stop me hoping  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I just wanna know what we should've done,  
Wanna figure out what we could've become,  
'Cause I know in my heart I'm not over you,  
I just wanna go back and try it again,  
Turn back the time this isn't the end of us,  
This isn't the end of us  
This isn't the end of us  
  
Whoa  
  
[Chorus: x2]

You left me spinning like a disco  
Trying but I don't know  
If I can stand straight  
You took me left when you knew I was right  
Now I got to try to fight just to make it through the day  
  
I never knew what you were capable of  
Baby, I would've kept my heart  
But I gave it up  
Baby, I fell in love  
Now I don't know where to start  
  
It's so cold with nobody to hold me  
You're so wrong for leaving when you told me  
You would never leave me by myself  
Out in the middle of nowhere  
Now I'm lost  
Trying to make it on my own  
I thought I could never do this,  
But now I'm walking by myself  
Out in the middle of nowhere  
  
You left me broken like a record  
Baby, I'm baby I'm hurt and I don't want to play anymore  
Missed every sign  
Believed ever lie  
And I was waiting for more  
  
I never knew what you were capable of  
Baby, I would've kept my heart  
But I gave it up  
Baby, I fell in love  
Now I don't know where to start  
  
It's so cold with nobody to hold me  
You're so wrong for leaving when you told me  
You would never leave me by myself  
Out in the middle of nowhere  
Now I'm lost  
Trying to make it on my own  
I thought I could never do this alone,  
But now I'm walking by myself  
Out in the middle of nowhere  
  
You took my heart off my sleeve  
But now I'm taking it back  
Baby, here I come  
You took advantage of me  
I don't appreciate that, that  
You son of a gun  
  
It's so cold with nobody to hold me  
You're so wrong for leaving when you told me  
You would never leave me by myself  
Out in the middle of nowhere  
  
It's so cold with nobody to hold me  
You're so wrong for leaving when you told me  
You would never leave me by myself  
Out in the middle of nowhere  
Now I'm lost  
Trying to make it on my own  
I thought I could never do this alone,  
But now I'm walking by myself  
Out in the middle of nowhere

How you choose to express yourself  
It's all your own and I can tell  
It comes naturally, it comes naturally  
  
You follow what you feel inside  
It's intuitive you don't have to try  
It comes naturally, mmm yeah, it comes naturally  
  
And it takes my breath away  
What you do so naturally  
  
You are the thunder and I am the lightning  
And I love the way you know who you are  
And to me it's exciting  
When you know it's meant to be  
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally  
When you're with me, baby  
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally  
Bay bay bay baby  
  
You have a way of moving me  
Your force of nature, your energy  
It comes naturally (you know it does)  
It comes naturally  
  
And it takes my breath away  
What you do, so naturally  
  
You are the thunder and I am the lightning  
And I love the way you know who you are  
And to me it's exciting  
When you know it's meant to be  
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally  
When you're with me, baby  
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally  
Bay bay bay baby  
  
When we collide, sparks fly  
When you look in my eyes, it takes my breath away  
  
(You are) You are the thunder and I am the lightning  
And I love the way you know who you are  
And to me it's exciting  
When you know it's meant to be  
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally  
When you're with me, baby  
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally  
Bay bay baby  
  
Naturally, naturally, naturally  
Everything baby comes naturally  
Naturally, naturally, naturally  
Bay bay baby

[Verse 1]  
No heart, no hands, no skin, no touch  
Can get me there, nowhere enough  
To love me like you do, to love me like you do  
No kiss, no lips, no feel, no rush  
Can you keep me high, I swear no one  
Can love me like you do, can love me like you do, no  
  
[Chorus]  
Nobody's gonna love me like you  
Nobody, uh  
Nobody, no uh  
Nobody's gonna love me like you do  
Like you, ooh  
Nobody's gonna love me like you  
Nobody, uh  
Nobody, no uh  
Nobody's ever loved me to the truth  
Like you, ooh  
  
Nobody's gonna love me like you  
Nobody, nobody ooh  
  
[Verse 2]  
No oxygen, can barely breathe  
My darkest sin, you've raised release  
And it's all because of you, all because of you  
I don't know what it is, but you've pulled me in  
No one compares, could ever begin  
To love me like you do  
And I wouldn't want them to  
Cause...  
  
[Chorus]  
Nobody's gonna love me like you  
Nobody, uh  
Nobody, no uh  
Nobody's gonna love me like you do  
Like you, ooh  
Nobody's gonna love me like you  
Nobody, uh  
Nobody, no uh  
Nobody's ever loved me to the truth  
Like you, ooh  
  
[Chorus]  
Nobody's gonna love me like you  
Nobody, uh  
Nobody, no uh  
Nobody's gonna love me like you do  
Like you, ooh  
Nobody's gonna love me like you  
Nobody, uh  
Nobody, no uh  
Nobody's ever loved me to the truth  
Like you, ooh  
  
[Bridge]  
I don't want nothing else  
Not when I had the best  
I don't want nothing else  
Because you showed me the best  
  
[Chorus]  
Nobody's gonna love me like you  
Nobody, uh  
Nobody, no uh  
Nobody's gonna love me like you do  
Like you, ooh  
Nobody's gonna love me like you  
Nobody, uh  
Nobody, no uh  
Nobody's ever loved me to the truth  
Like you, ooh

Hey, hey, hey  
La, la, la, la, la  
Hey, hey, hey  
La, la, la, la, la  
  
You come from here  
I come from there  
  
You rock out in your room  
I rock a world premiere  
  
We're more alike than  
Anybody could ever tell  
(Ever tell)  
  
Friday, we're cool  
Monday, we're freaks  
  
Sometimes we rule  
Sometimes we can't even speak  
  
But we can kick it up and  
Let loose and l-o-l (l-o-l)  
  
It may seem cliche  
For me to wanna say  
That you're not alone  
  
And you can call me uncool  
But it's a simple fact  
I got your back  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
'Cause we're one and the same  
We're something more than ordinary  
One and the same  
I think we're almost legendary  
You and me the perfect team  
Chasing down the dream  
We're one and the same  
Hey, hey, hey  
La,la,la,la,la  
  
I'm kind of like you  
You're kind of like me  
  
We write the same song  
In a different key  
  
It's got a rhythm  
You and me  
Can get along  
(Get along)  
  
And it may seem cliche  
For me to wanna say  
That you're not alone  
  
And you can call me uncool  
But it's a simple fact  
I still got your back  
  
'Cause we're one and the same  
We're anything but ordinary  
One and the same  
I think we're almost legendary  
You and me the perfect team  
Shaking up the scene  
We're one and the same  
  
'Cause we're one and the same  
We're anything but ordinary  
One and the same  
We're something more than momentary  
  
'Cause we're one  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
'Cause we're one  
I think we're almost legendary  
We're anything but ordinary  
You and me the perfect team  
Chasing down the dream  
Oh, you and me the perfect team  
Shaking up the scene  
We're one and the same  
  
Hey, hey, hey  
La, la, la, la, la  
Hey, hey, hey

You've been riding this horse a long time  
Why can't you find what you've been looking for?  
Always greener on the other side  
Always believing there must be something more  
  
Never stay very long anywhere  
As the next girl you leave gets smaller  
In your rear view mirror  
  
You're an outlaw  
You're an outlaw  
You're an outlaw running from love  
You're an outlaw  
You're an outlaw  
You're an outlaw running from love  
If you tear her world apart you have no regrets  
If there's a key to your heart no one's found it yet  
You're an outlaw  
You're an outlaw  
You're an outlaw running from love  
  
Your reputation's getting out of control  
I can't believe she believes one word you said  
Before I let you take my girlfriend home  
I've got to warn her about the price on your head  
  
It must feel so alone out there  
Always running away from someone  
But you get no where  
  
You're an outlaw  
You're an outlaw  
You're an outlaw running from love  
You're an outlaw  
You're an outlaw  
You're an outlaw running from love  
If you tear her world apart you have no regrets  
If there's a key to your heart no one's found it yet  
You're an outlaw  
You're an outlaw  
You're an outlaw running from love  
  
I'm from the Lone Star state  
I'm ready to bring you in, oh  
I'm gonna seal your fate  
Make you pay for all of your sins, oh  
Oh oh  
  
You've been riding this horse a long time  
I've had my eye on you all night  
I'm gonna find a way to make you mine  
I know, even though  
  
You're an outlaw  
You're an outlaw  
You're an outlaw running from love  
You're an outlaw  
You're an outlaw  
You're an outlaw running from love  
If you tear her world apart you have no regrets  
If there's a key to your heart no one's found it yet  
You're an outlaw  
You're an outlaw  
You're an outlaw running from love  
  
Stop running

[Verse 1]  
Different inflection when you say my name  
Kiss me, but your kiss don't taste the same  
Is it real or am I going out of my mind?  
Curious 'bout the company that you keep  
Cause I hear you talking 'bout her in your sleep  
And now you've got me talking 'bout her in mine  
  
[Pre-Chorus 1]  
Ooh, and I bet she has it all  
Bet she's beautiful like you, like you  
And I bet she's got that touch  
Makes you fall in love, like you, like you  
  
[Chorus]  
I can taste her lipstick and see her laying across your chest  
I can feel the distance every time you remember her fingertips  
Maybe I should be more like her  
Maybe I should be more like her  
I can taste her lipstick, it's like I'm kissing her, too  
And she's perfect  
And she's perfect  
  
[Verse 2]  
How does she touch you? Can I try it, too?  
I know you're twisted, but baby, I'm twisted, too  
I wanna know how she could make a man lose his mind  
  
[Pre-Chorus 2]  
With the smell of her perfume  
I could love her, too, like you, like you  
And I can almost hear her laugh  
Curving on her back for you, for you  
  
[Chorus]  
I can taste her lipstick and see her laying across your chest  
I can feel the distance every time you remember her fingertips  
Maybe I should be more like her  
Maybe I should be more like her  
I can taste her lipstick, it's like I'm kissing her, too  
And she's perfect  
  
[Bridge]  
I can see her body rushing into you  
Crashing on your skin  
Burning within, burning so deep, deep  
On your skin, skin next to me  
She's crashing on your skin  
Settling in, burning so deep, deep  
On your skin, skin while you sleep, uh  
  
[Chorus]  
I can taste her lipstick and see her laying across your chest  
I can feel the distance every time you remember her fingertips  
Maybe I should be more like her  
Maybe I should be more like her  
I can taste her lipstick, it's like I'm kissing her, too  
And she's perfect

[Intro]  
I dive into the future  
But I'm blinded by the sun  
I'm reborn in every moment  
So who knows what I'll become  
  
[Verse 1]  
I feel like I've awakened lately  
The chains around me are finally breaking  
I've been under self-restoration  
I'm becoming my own salvation  
Showing up, no more hiding, hiding  
The light inside me is bursting, shining  
It's my, my, my time to butterfly  
  
[Chorus]  
What I've learned is so vital  
More than just survival  
This is my revival  
This is a revival  
Oh-oh-oh-oh  
Oh-oh-oh  
Oh-oh-oh-oh  
Revival  
Oh-oh-oh-oh  
Oh-oh-oh  
Oh-oh-oh-oh  
Revival  
  
[Verse 2]  
I'll walk through the fire, I'll begin again  
I'll burn through my skin  
Cause I, cause I wanna feel it  
Reaching for the truth, not afraid to lose  
What shattered through me like a rifle was a revival  
I admit, it's been painful, painful  
But I'll be honest, I'm grateful, grateful  
It's my, my, my time to realize  
  
[Chorus]  
What I've learned is so vital  
More than just survival  
This is my revival  
This is a revival  
Oh-oh-oh-oh  
Oh-oh-oh  
Oh-oh-oh-oh  
Revival  
Oh-oh-oh-oh  
Oh-oh-oh  
Oh-oh-oh-oh  
Revival  
  
[Bridge]  
This won't take too long, you'll see  
I'm just tryna get to me, ooh  
What shattered through me like a rifle was a revival  
  
[Chorus]  
What I've learned is so vital  
More than just survival  
This is my revival  
This is a revival  
Oh-oh-oh-oh  
Oh-oh-oh  
Oh-oh-oh-oh  
Revival  
Oh-oh-oh-oh  
Oh-oh-oh  
Oh-oh-oh-oh  
Revival  
  
[Outro]  
What I've learned is so vital  
More than just survival  
This is my revival  
This is a revival

Round and round  
Round and round  
Round and round  
Round and round  
You see me standing there  
And act like you don't know me  
But last night you were calling me  
Saying you want me  
  
Oh, why you always make me feel  
Like I'm the one, that's crazy  
You got my heart racin'  
My, my heart racin'  
  
Boy, I need you here with me  
We can't go on this way  
I'm fallen hard for you  
All I can say  
  
We're goin' round and round  
We're never gonna stop  
Goin' round and round  
We'll never get where  
We're goin'  
Round and round  
Well you're gonna miss me  
'Cause I'm getting dizzy  
Goin' round and round  
And round and round  
  
You try to pull me close  
And whisper in my ear  
You always told me lies  
I've cried out all my tears  
I push my feelings to the side  
But then you bring 'em back  
B-Bring 'em back  
Now you got me singing  
  
Boy, I need you here with me  
We can't go on this way  
I'm falling hard for you  
All I can say  
  
We're goin'  
Round and round  
We're never gonna stop  
Goin' round and round  
We'll never get where  
We're goin'  
Round and round  
Well you're gonna miss me  
'Cause I'm getting dizzy  
Goin' round and round  
And round  
  
Love me or love me not  
I'm starin' at the clock  
I take them flower petals off  
And then I watch them drop (x2)  
  
Boy  
I need you here with me  
I can't go on this way  
I'm falling hard for you  
All I can sayeeaay  
  
Round and round  
We're never gonna stop  
Goin' round and round  
We'll never get where  
We're goin'  
Round and round  
Well you're gonna miss me  
'Cause I'm getting dizzy  
Goin' round and round  
And round and round  
  
We're never gonna stop  
Goin' round and round  
We'll never get where  
We're goin' round and round  
  
Well you're gonna miss me  
'Cause I'm getting dizzy  
Goin' round and round  
And round  
  
Ooo oh Ooo oh Ooo oh (x3)

Kiss the moon goodbye  
But don't close your eyes, your eyes  
It's the end of the night  
But the beginning of time, for you and I  
I can't believe that my body is still moving  
It makes me feel like we're doing something right.  
  
Baby when the night starts slipping  
When the night starts slipping  
When the night starts slipping away  
Boy you got my heartbeat skipping  
When you touch me even though  
The time is ticking away  
Just tell me it's not over  
And we'll never reach the end  
But when the night starts slipping away,  
Save the day

Yeah we're still wide awake  
Got me losing my mind, my mind  
No, it's never too late,  
Put your lips on mine  
In the burning sunlight, I  
I can't believe that my body is still moving  
It makes me feel like we're doing something right.  
  
Baby when the night starts slipping  
When the night starts slipping  
When the night starts slipping away  
Boy you got my heartbeat skipping  
When you touch me even though  
The time is ticking away  
Just tell me it's not over  
And we'll never reach the end  
But when the night starts slipping away,

Kiss the moon goodbye  
But don't close your eyes, eyes, eyes  
  
Baby when the night starts slipping  
When the night starts slipping  
When the night starts slipping away  
Boy you got my heartbeat skipping  
When you touch me even though  
The time is ticking away  
Just tell me it's not over  
And we'll never reach the end  
But when the night starts slipping away,

Don't like waiting  
Don't like waiting  
Lets go right now!  
Gotta' hit the ground  
Dancing before the music  
Slows down  
  
What I'm sayin'  
What I'm sayin'  
If there's something to fix  
Take it to another level,  
This is the remix  
  
Everybody, everybody  
Get out on the floor  
It can get a little crazy  
When the kick hits the floor  
  
Make a scene  
Make a scene  
Nobody can ignore  
Don't knock it, til you rock it  
We can't take it no more  
  
Bring the lights up  
Bust the doors down

All together now!  
Shake it up!  
Shake it up!

I've got something to say  
When you're dancin' with me,  
It's like we go MIA  
  
Make a scene  
Make a scene  
Nobody can ignore  
Don't knock it, til you rock it  
We can't take it no more

[Verse 1]  
We fall for each other at the wrong time  
Only for a moment, but I don't mind  
Guess I don't know where to draw the line, the line, the line  
And we'll play the same game every night  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Up in the clouds  
Yeah, you know how to make me want you  
When we come down  
Oh I know, yeah I know, it's over  
  
[Chorus]  
You don't know how to love me when you're sober  
When the bottle's done you pull me closer  
And you're saying all the things that you're supposed to  
But you don't know how to love me when you're sober  
  
[Verse 2]  
Why is it so different when we wake up?  
Same lips, same kiss, but not the same touch  
Don't you know that you do it just enough, but not enough  
But I know what's next, and I want so much  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Up in the clouds  
Yeah, you know how to make me want you  
When we come down  
Oh I know, yeah I know, it's over  
  
[Chorus]  
You don't know how to love me when you're sober  
When the bottle's done you pull me closer  
And you're saying all the things that you're supposed to  
But you don't know how to love me when you're sober  
  
[Bridge]  
I know I should leave, I know I should, should, should  
But your love's too good, your love's too good, good, good  
I know I should leave, I know I should, should, should  
But your love's too good, your love's too good, good, good  
Yeah!  
  
[Chorus]  
You don't know how to love me when you're sober  
When the bottle's done you pull me closer  
And you're saying all the things that you're supposed to  
But you don't know how to love me when you're sober  
  
[Outro]  
You've got a hold on me  
You're like a wasted dream  
I gave you everything  
But you don't know how to love me when you're sobe

Wake up to your dreams  
And watch them come true  
I'll make you whisper my name, I'll never leave the room  
Night and day, I'll be your muse  
No other girl can make you feel the way I do  
  
I can make the stars dance  
Light up the moon, I can make the stars dance  
If you want me to  
The sky is everywhere, so meet me under there  
I can make the stars dance dance dance with you  
  
Don't be afraid, close your eyes  
Let me take you to places you've never been tonight  
I thought by know you'd realize I can do anything I put my mind to  
  
I can make the stars dance  
Light up the moon, I can make the stars dance  
If you want me to  
The sky is everywhere, so meet me under there  
I can make the stars dance dance dance with you  
  
Everything I touch turns to love  
Everything I do will open up heaven  
It's dead steady, there's falling and flying in love  
Nothing's forever because we are just stars, dance  
  
I can make the stars dance  
Light up the moon, I can make the stars dance  
If you want me to  
The sky is everywhere, so meet me under there  
I can make the stars dance dance dance with you  
  
I can make the stars dance  
I can make the stars dance  
I can make, I can make, I can make the stars dance  
  
The sky is everywhere, so meet me under there  
I can make the stars dance dance dance with you

I look at you, and all I wanna do, it's just disappear  
I got a craving for you, baby, can we get out of here  
You're a sexy machine, you're a Hollywood dream  
And you got me feeling like a homecoming queen  
Let's drop out of this crowd, somewhere no one's allowed  
I want you  
  
All to myself, I want you all to myself  
And nobody else, yeah,  
You don't need no other lover, we can keep it undercover  
Find me in the shadows, I'm protegee  
Damn until tomorrow  
And make sure that no-nobody follows  
You don't need no other lover, we can keep it undercover  
  
You don't need no other lover, we can keep it undercover  
  
I wanna find a place where we can be alone in the dark  
And you can navigate me like a map that you know by heart  
You're a sexy machine, you're a Hollywood dream  
And you got me feeling like a homecoming queen  
Let's drop out of this crowd, somewhere no one's allowed  
I want you  
  
All to myself, I want you all to myself  
And nobody else, yeah,  
You don't need no other lover, we can keep it undercover  
Find me in the shadows, I'm protegee  
Damn until tomorrow  
And make sure that no-nobody follows  
You don't need no other lover, we can keep it undercover  
  
You don't need no other lover, we can keep it undercover  
  
I wanna find a place where we can be alone in the dark  
And you can navigate me like a map that you know by heart  
  
All to myself, I want you all to myself  
And nobody else, yeah,  
You don't need no other lover,  
You don't need no other lover  
You don't need no other lover  
We can keep it undercover  
  
You don't need no other lover, we can keep it undercover  
  
You don't need no other lover, we can keep it undercover

Is it alright, if I'm with you for the night  
Hope you don't mind, if you stay by my side  
We can drive in your car, somewhere into the dark  
Pull over and watch the stars  
We can dance, we can sing, do whatever you think  
As long as I'm with you  
  
[Chorus]  
When we are together its the time of our lives  
We can do whatever, be whoever we'd like  
Spend the weekend dancing 'cause when we sleep when we die  
Don't have to worry about nothing  
We own the night! (ah-ah-oh)  
We own the night!  
We own the night  
We own the night  
  
It's all a blur,  
It's getting late but I don't care  
I don't know where we'll end up  
And that's okay  
  
We can drive in your car, somewhere into the dark  
Pull over and watch the stars  
We can dance, we can sing, do whatever you think  
As long as I'm with you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Nothing lasts forever  
Let's live it up when we're together  
Nothing lasts forever  
So let's live it up, just do whatever  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When we are together its the time of our lives  
We can do whatever, be whoever we'd like  
Spend the weekend dancing cause when we sleep when we die  
Don't have to worry about nothing  
We own the night! (ah-ah-oh)  
  
(Just do what you like)  
(Ah-ah-oh) We own the night!  
(Do whatever you like)  
(Ah-ah-oh) We own the night!  
(Just do what you like)  
(Ah-ah-oh) We own the night!  
(Do whatever you like)

Take my arm, take my head  
Make your mark like a man  
Write your name, gonna write your name  
Hurts so good, loving thing  
When all fades, you remain  
Write your name, gonna write your name  
  
Write your name, across my heart  
Write your name, over every part  
And we could be, worlds apart  
Write your name, across my heart  
Write your name  
  
Gonna write your name  
Write your name  
Gonna write your name  
  
Harmony leave your scar  
When you're gone, you're never far  
Write your name, gonna write your name  
Company, oh, you are, over me, you take me on  
Write your name, gonna write your name  
  
Write your name, across my heart  
Write your name, over every part  
And we could be, worlds apart  
Write your name, across my heart  
  
It's your name across my heart written in gold  
A permanent mark, love engraved  
It's what we are, more than words, this love is art  
Poetry emotion, put it right there  
Deeper than skin, crystal clear  
Let us don't fade, titanium made  
Further here, forever safe  
  
Write your name, across my heart  
Write your name, across my heart  
Write your name, over every part  
And we could be, worlds apart  
Write your name, across my heart  
Write your name  
Gonna write your name  
Write your name  
Gonna write your name
