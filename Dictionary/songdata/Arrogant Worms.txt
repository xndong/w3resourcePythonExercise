Dad threw up on Christmas Day  
He puked on the serving tray  
The stuffing's come right out of Daddy dear  
Now everybody's Christmas vacation  
Will be filled with a viral infection  
Maybe we'll all be better by next year  
We felt more than a breeze  
When Daddy had to sneeze  
It didn't sound a lot like Ah-Choo  
Mom was saying grace  
When Daddy barked on her face  
So Mom asked God to bless the vomit too  
Dad threw up on Christmas Day  
He got some chunks on Uncle Ray  
Who kept on talking about his pancreas  
We'll all remember Christmas Eve  
As the last time we were free of disease  
And able to digest some solid food  

Darling for you  
I think of what I'd so  
To keep you safe and sound  
I would climb the highest mountain  
I would swim the widest sea  
I would wrestle a gorilla to the ground  
I would fend off a dozen charging rhinos  
I would catch a storm of killer bees  
I would fight a firey dragon with a wooden sword  
If I didn't know what this could do to me  
  
'Cause it's too dangerous (too dangerous)  
I'd really like to do it  
But I might get hurt  
It's dangerous (too dangerous)  
I don't feel like bleeding  
On my brand new shirt  
You might say I'm cowardly  
Or say I'll full of fright  
You might call me yellow  
And baby you'd be right!  
  
So I'd skip across volcanoes full of lava  
I'd even grab a tiger by the tail  
I would make fun of  
A boxing champion's mother  
But my courage and my bowels both would fail  
I would fight off a bunch  
Of angry Kosacks  
I would stop a thousand  
Bullets with my hand  
I would laugh  
As my leg was amputated..  
But baby, I'm not that kind of man!  
  
'Cause it's too dangerous (too dangerous)  
I use big words  
But I never do the deed  
It's dangerous (too dangerous)  
I faint like a baby  
If I see somebody bleed  
I haven't got a backbone  
I'm as timid as a mouse  
I would find a cure for this  
But I can't leave the house!  
  
Cause it's dangerous  
Too dangerous  
Too dangerous  
  
For me!  
For me!  
For me.

Watchin' television one afternoon  
Lookin' for a movie or a good cartoon  
Stopped by a station's commercial break  
When suddenly I'm faced with a heartache  
The woman of my dreams is plain in view  
Sellin' me a can of liver stew  
  
I said dog food (dog food)  
Dog food woman  
Dog food (dog food)  
Dog food woman  
Dog food (dog food)  
Dog food woman  
Dog food (dog food)  
Dog food woman  
You steal my heart, and you take my soul  
Every time I see you fill Fido's bowl  
  
Now I watch TV 20 hours a day  
Just to watch your commercials play  
If someday your love was in reach  
I'd be all yours honey, you could put me on a leash  
You love that dog, could you love a man?  
I make my own gravy when you show that can  
  
I said dog food (dog food)  
Dog food woman  
Dog food (dog food)  
Dog food woman  
Dog food (dog food)  
Dog food woman  
Dog food (dog food)  
Dog food woman  
You steal my heart, and you take my soul  
Every time I see you fill Fido's bowl  
  
I figure the only way she'll notice me  
Is if I buy what she's sellin' on TV  
So I stop at the local shopping mall  
Head to the pet store and buy it all  
Go to the bank and empty my savings  
So I can buy more of what Spot is craving  
  
Spent all my money by accident  
Can't buy groceries or pay the rent  
Got evicted now I live on the street  
Crunchy kibble's all I got to eat  
My breath is real bad, my tongue's turning black  
But I've got a nice shiny coat of hair on my back  
  
I said dog food (dog food)  
Dog food woman  
Dog food (dog food)  
Dog food woman  
Dog food (dog food)  
Dog food woman  
Dog food (dog food)  
Dog food woman  
You steal my heart, and you take my soul  
Every time I see you fill Fido's bowl  
  
(Dogs barking and howling)  
Yeah, take it for a walk!  
  
I said dog food (dog food)  
Dog food woman  
Dog food (dog food)  
Dog food woman  
Dog food (dog food)  
Dog food woman  
Dog food (dog food)  
Dog food woman  
You steal my heart, and you take my soul  
Every time I see you fill Fido's bowl

I came to town in the heat  
A lonely man with tired feet  
Covered heat to toe in perspiration  
Then you caught me unaware  
Body so sleek I had to stare  
And me a man in need of transportation  
I do not how you got  
Into Hernandez' Used Car Lot  
But I knew that you were  
Coming back with me  
I had to have you for my own  
But should I lease or get a loan  
Sometimes love is not free  
And I'll dress you up in fuzzy dice  
A liscence plate that glows  
And chrome exhaust pipes  
I'll dress you up in fuzzy dice  
And together we ride into the night  
Paid Hernandez to let you go  
My lovely El Camino  
Could hardly wait to get you to my place  
And even though we love each other  
I will put on plastic seat covers  
Nowadays you cannot be too safe  
I will buff you every night  
And put your lugnuts on so tight  
Do you love me as much as I love you  
And when I drive you 'round a corner  
Do you think of another owner  
Am I enough for you?  
Oh, I'll dress you up in fuzzy dice  
Funny bumper stickers and tires with walls of white  
I'll dress you up in fuzzy dice  
And together we will ride into the night  
Vroom vroom vroom

I used to go to all the parties  
And make love to all the beautiful ladies  
And I'd eat cheeseburgers with bacon and extra grease when I was  
Hungry  
And drink Windex Colladas until my skin turned blue  
But now,the times they are a-changing  
My lifestyle, it is rearranging  
For debauchery may be fun and entertaining  
But it is also very bad for you  
Do you know how many diseases you can get  
Making love to someone who has not had all their tests  
So nowadays, I am celibate  
And I wear a condom, in case I have dirty thoughts  
I never drive my car past the speed limit  
And I always wear my seat belt when I am in it  
I traded my Lambourghini for a Honda Civic  
Because it is more fuel-efficient and practical  
Ay-yi-yi! Ay-yi-yo!  
Being boring is the way to go!  
Ay-yi-yi! Ay-yi-yo!  
Having fun is bad for you!  
I can no longer smoke my cigarettes  
Because I found that they are a major cause of death  
The tar and nicotine have not killed me yet  
But if I got pregnant, they could hurt my baby  
I used to love my sorry complexion (sorry?)  
I tanned myself to perfection  
But the sun can give you a cancerous infection  
So now I'm white and pasty and I never leave the house  
I used to eat like there was no tomorrow  
But then I found cholesterol is full of sorrow  
The last thing I want to do is to have to borrow  
Somebody else's heart, because mine is full of fatty deposits  
Ay-yi-yi! Ay-yi-yo!  
Being boring is the way to go!  
Ay-yi-yi! Ay-yi-yo!  
Having fun is bad for you!  
Having fun is bad for you!  

When I'm dead put my head in the freezer  
Right beside the corn and the peas  
I may be dead but I am not deceased, dear  
One day science will re-animate me  
Oh I heard about the rich who when they die  
Get themselves frozen cryogenic-wise  
I know we can't afford to hire no company  
When my heart don't beat no more and I lay rigourmortisously  
But we got that freezer up on top our fridge  
Can't squeeze in my whole body, baby, I'm just way too big  
How I wish we had afforded that fancy Frigidaire  
So you'd just have to chop off my legs and my derriere  
When I'm dead put my head in the freezer  
Right beside the corn and the peas  
I may be dead but I am not deceased, dear  
One day science will re-animate me  
Oh I know baby, you're up for the task  
You'll wrap me up with more than just string and plastic wrap  
Using Tupperware, 'cause you care, and out of concern  
That I'd come back to life with a case of freezer burn  
When I'm dead put my head in the freezer  
Right beside the corn and the peas  
I may be dead but I am not deceased, dear  
One day science will re-animate me  
Oh when I thaw, when I thaw  
Hope my new body's six feet tall or more  
And if you can't find a man in time  
Get a horse, I might make a nice centaur  
Oh you'll see my face each night in your dreams  
And when you go to the kitchen to fetch some ice cream  
But don't worry honey, soon I'll be back on earth  
When they cure death and get bodies for the rich guys first  
When I'm dead put my head in the freezer  
Right beside the corn and the peas  
You can dispose of my body at your leisure  
You know, I don't think that it ever suited me  
When I'm dead put my head in the freezer  
Right beside the corn and the peas  
I may be dead but I am not deceased, dear  
One day science will re-animate me

From the deepest, darkest depths of... Whitby!  
Comes this sordid tale of speed...  
Murderous mayhem..  
Cataclysmic combustion...  
Picturesque powered pistons...  
Accellerating automotive alarms...  
Stunningly stupifying stereo stunts!  
One man... A dream... A car... A 1984... Plymouth... Horizon...  
  
I loved the car from tail to grill  
I wouldn't change a thing  
I wouldn't trade the ashtray  
For the Queen's engagement ring  
But things they started going wrong  
And went from bad to worse  
The clutch went kinda funny  
Then I couldn't use reverse  
Still I loved my baby  
And would not admit defeat  
Just because it left a trail  
Of rust along the street  
It kept on running bravely  
On duct tape and a prayer  
Plus a monthly tribute to  
The guy who did repairs  
It all seems so unfair (The man was glad the day he bought)  
  
Horizon!  
Horizon!  
  
Till one day on the parking lot  
They called 401  
My car became the meat between  
A Buick-Honda bun  
I saw some parts go flying  
That you really need to drive  
My car had become roadkill  
Though it never was alive  
Left a muffler in the passing lane  
A hubcap in the slow  
The windshield on the median  
A headlight in the snow  
And as I skidded off the road  
The other drivers laughed  
My middle-finger greeting  
Would be my epitaph  
Death would come at last (Here lies the man who dared to buy)  
  
Horizon!  
  
Now I look at my bent fender  
The twisted wheel rim  
I wonder if Horizon  
Will ever drive again  
But I know that this was not the end  
Road warriors die hard  
And I signed this Mr. Iacoca's  
Organ donor card  
The steel will get recycled  
And they'll build another car  
Bigger, faster, stronger  
An automotive star  
My quest will then begin  
And revenge will soon be mine  
As I drive my gleaming three-door  
Orange Chrysler Frankenstein  
Searching for that Buick  
To try to end it's days  
We'll settle off the score  
And then we'll drive away (The sun will rise again on the)  
  
Horizon!  
My Horizon!  
My Horizon!

I am not American,  
Though I live in North America  
Which is part of the Americas  
Which should make me an American  
Geographically Canadians,  
Are certainly Americans  
As are Venisallians,  
But not Hawaiians  
They're out in the middle of the Ocean  
Just like the you. S. Virgin Islands,  
Who shoudn't say they are Americans,  
Or even Virgins  
How could two whole continents,  
Lose their name to one Constitute  
Where were we when the you. S. Went,  
And took the word American away?  
But to be fair to them,  
Their other name options,  
Like you. S. A. Ers or United Statesians,  
Were pretty bad  
Still I want to be as American,  
As the French are European,  
Or those in Antarctica are Antarctican  
Even if they're just penguins  
That leaves us Canadians as Northern North American,  
But Alaskas Norther curse them  
We're surrounded by Americans  
Americans, Americans!  
I just called those you. S. A. Ers Americans  
A name meant for two continents not just them  
For if I said I was American,  
People would probably think I came from Maine  
Still I think I have a plan,  
Let's become Antarctican,  
And join up with the penguins  
For just like them, we're not American!

I spend my days watching tv with a beer  
(ooh-ahh, you're fat)  
This seems to have caused my upper belly to appear  
(ooh-ahh, you're fat)  
Then one day, my woman went and left me  
(she did not want to sleep with a whale)  
She said she found someone more manly  
(a body that could not fail)  
So I went and I looked into the mirror  
(you look like a big tub of goo)  
And I dreamed of being big and manly  
(dreaming is the best you can do)  
I though to myself, what would I ask for  
(if someone gave you a wish)  
I think I'd like to look like my hero  
(he's one big manly bisch)  
I want to look like Arnold Schwartzenegger  
I don't want to be fat and weak, oh no, oh no  
I want to look like Arnold Schwartzenegger  
I want a manly physique  
I put down the cheetos and I went on a crash diet  
(carrots were all you ate)  
Then I noticed that my skin was turning orange  
(you're just a big mistake)  
Then I overdosed on diet pills  
(too bad you did not die)  
Still I want to look like my idol  
(the great big beefy guy)  
I want to look like Arnold Schwartzenegger  
I don't want to be fat and weak, oh no, oh no  
I want to look like Arnold Schwartzenegger  
I want a manly physique  
I bought myself a weight set and some steriods  
(to make you big and strong)  
And I worked out really really hard  
(but it did not last for long)  
I put out my back, and the steroids made me sterile  
(not like it mattered anyway)  
And about looking like my hero  
(he has one thing to say)  
I don't want to look like Arnold Schwartzenegger  
I don't mind being fat and weak, oh no, oh no  
I don't want to look like Arnold Schwartzenegger  
It's easier being fat and lazy  
You'll never look like Arnold Schwartzenegger  
You'll always be fat and weak, oh yes, oh yes  
You'll never look like Arnold Schwartzenegger  
You are fat and ugly

Oh, Johnny was a tall man but his memory was short  
He'd forget to duck at doorways and often he'd get hurt  
I took good care of him for he had no family  
Actually he did, but he forgot who they be  
Johnny often liked to go out on the town  
He'd forget where he'd be going so he'd just wander around  
I knew when he was back for I would hear the smack  
Of his head hitting the doorway but tonight it was alack  
Johnny came home headless, it was a great disgrace  
But wherever it's a-lying there's a smile upon his face  
I should have seen it coming, he finally lost his mind  
But if his head don't turn up soon then all his hats are mine  
Johnny came towards me but suddenly he stopped  
As if trying to think of something but having no luck  
Still he didn't notice that his head weren't there  
'Til he took out a brush and tried to comb his hair  
I said, "Johnny where's your cranium?" but he didn't seem to know  
He just shrugged his shoulders and tried to find his nose  
And the sight of him there topless made me start to cry  
For I feared we'd ne'er again see eye to eye  
Johnny came home headless, it was a great disgrace  
But wherever it's a-lying there's a smile upon his face  
I should have seen it coming, he should have stayed in bed  
For now I fear he'll spend his life just trying to get ahead  
Refusing to believe that he had split for good  
His lower half and me searched the neighbourhood  
It soon became apparent that his head we wouldn't find it  
He could not retrace his steps, he was absent minded  
Well years went by til late one night I heard a voice I swore  
Was Johnny calling out to me, I flung open the door  
Johnny's head was home, it took a taxi cab  
Alas, it was too late, his body had gone bad  
Johnny's head was homeless, his body was cremated  
And the funeral was harder than he had anticipated  
I should of seen it coming he said in his eulogy  
But never thought I'd have to say I ain't got no-body  
(I ain't got nobody)  
Johnny came home headless, it was a great disgrace  
But now his head's upon a shelf, a smile upon his face  
But now his head's upon a shelf, a smile upon his face  
  

About 6 months ago, someone came by with a petition  
Said we'd wanna stop these folks moving in next door  
I refused to sign and told him everyone was welcome  
'Cause that's what neighbourhoods are for  
So they moved in and I'll admit they look peculiar  
They invited me to a friendly barbeque  
Glad I got to know 'em, and let me tell you something  
They may be metallic, but they're just like me and you  
No, there's nothing wrong with killer robots from Venus  
They gave me zucchini from their garden yesterday (they're very fresh)  
No, there's nothing wrong with killer robots from Venus  
You may disagree, but I think they're A-OK!  
My buddy Charlie never got off the robots' backs  
Then one day, him and his whole house disappeared  
I talked about it to my neighbours, the killer robots from Venus  
They couldn't help me, but agreed that it was wierd...  
No, there's nothing wrong with killer robots from Venus  
They always mow their lawn, and they joined the PTA (because we care)  
No, there's nothing wrong with killer robots from Venus  
You may disagree, but I think they're A-OK!  
They had us over for an outdoor New Year's party  
Though it was 10 below, there was food and drink a-plenty  
They got excited as we counted down with them  
And when we kissed them, our lips stuck to their heads (ouch)  
I was watching the news last night, when I saw something funny  
Killer robots from somewhere decimated Montreal  
I wondered, could it be my neighbours, the killer robots from Venus?  
Could it be them after all?  
No. They're so nice! Yeah.  
No, there's nothing wrong with killer robots from Venus  
They applauded for my kid at the Christmas play (he was the best  
Shepard)  
No, there's nothing wrong with killer robots from Venus  
You may disagree, but I think they're A-OK!  
You may disagree, but I think they're A-OK!  
You may disagree, but I think they're A-OK! (We're OK!)  

One, two, three, four...  
  
we'd be free if great if everybody had a gun  
we'd be free if everybody had a gun  
There'd be no more crime, 'cause everybody'd have a gun!  
we'd be free if everybody had a gun  
  
we'd be free if everybody had a gun  
we'd be free if if everybody had a gun

(Yeah!)  
we'd be free if everybody had a gun  
  
we'd be free if everybody had a gun (had a gun)  
we'd be free if everybody had a gun (had a gun)  
Nobody'd ever get shot, 'cause everybody'd have a gun! (Makes sense!)  
we'd be free if everybody had a gun  
  
We could go out and shoot things  
We could go out and shoot things  
We could go out and shoot things  
We could go out and shoot things  
We could go out and shoot things  
We could go out and shoot things  
We'd all feel safe, 'cause everybody'd have a gun!  
  
we'd be free if everybody had a gun (had a gun)  
we'd be free if everybody had a gun (had a gun)  
Everyone'd be equal, 'cause everybody'd have a gun!  
Not me, I got me a rifle!  
Well hang on, if you got yourself a rifle then I want to get me a semi-
automatic  
weapon!  
You get a semi-automatic weapon and I'm gonna want an automatic weapon!  
You get yourself an automatic weapon, I'm gonna get a super-automatic weapon!  
Well if you get a super-automatic weapon, then I'm gonna get a  
super-duper-automatic weapon with a CD-ROM drive!  
If you get yourself one of those I'm gonna get a  
super-duper-automatic weapon with a CD-ROM drive, and a big old hard  
drive, and a big guitar amp so I can play BTOs...  
(rants on while the rest of the Worms sing)  
  
we'd be free if if everybody had the weapon of their choice  
we'd be free if great if everybody had the weapon of their choice  
we'd be free if everybody had a wepon of their choice  
  
(Still ranting..)  
I'll go so fast I'll be able to chase you from here to Saigon, and  
then I'll shoot like little Nerf rockets at you and poke you in the  
eye 'cause it'll have automatic like finger-poking in the eye  
things and I'll get myself another guitar amp...

Well grab your shoes, and grab your balls  
And lets head to those heavenly halls  
Sit on down and grab a beer  
Because bowling time is pretty near  
  
Tortured men forget their pain  
When they head to the bowling lane  
Let's go bowling  
Let's go bowling, got a coupon  
  
Let's go bowling, for a free game  
Let's go bowling  
Let's go bowling, let's go bowling  
Let's do it now  
  
Because Wrestlemania's fine by me  
Monster trucks are a sight to see  
A cultured life, that's nice and all  
But there ain't nothing better than a bowling ball  
  
You know the sport that God would choose  
Is the one with the three-tone leather-sole shoes  
Let's go bowling  
Let's go bowling, got a coupon  
  
Let's go bowling, from a juice can  
Let's go bowling  
Let's go bowling, let's go bowling  
Let's do it now  
  
Yes bowling! The sport of kings! The sport of queens!  
The sport of dukes...Earls...Bos...Johns...anything that  
Looks good when it's embroidered on a polyester shirt.  
And you know, bowling takes on this almost religious  
  
Significance because it's so much like a religion.  
I mean the ball is round, like the earth, and it's got  
The holy trinity: the Father, the Son, and the..  
Thumbhole. And as you roll the ball down the alley of  
  
Life...Striking out the pagan religions of the past...  
Sparing them the anguish of their lives in the gutter...  
Framing their existence in an eternal metaphysicalness  
Something like a 7-10 split!  
  
We'll be bowling in Moosejaw (yeah, yeah)  
We'll be bowling in Hickton (yeah, yeah)  
We'll be bowling in Gander (yeah, yeah)  
And in the Kingston Township (yeah, yeah)  
  
We'll be bowling Vancouver, bowling Saskatoon  
Someday they'll even be bowling on the moon  
I said yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Let's go bowling  
  
Let's go bowling, got a coupon  
Let's go bowling, for free shoes  
Let's go bowling

I met you in biology in high school  
You told me after college we'd be wed  
You were my favorite lab partner  
Till you ran off with that brilliant young pre-med  
  
My pain would show up on a cat-scan  
My optic nerves are only seeing blue  
My blood hates to flow  
Because it has to go  
Through the four-chambered heart that cries for you  
  
I'm in the lonely lab of broken hearts  
I dissect the way you say goodbye until it falls apart  
I'm in the lonely lab of feelin' blue  
And my pheremones can find no trace of you  
  
You were as sweet as crystalline carbohydrates  
The rods and cones in my optical receptors are filled with tears  
I wanted to elope  
So we could make some isotopes  
With a half-life of a million thousand years  
  
If I suspended my trachial dilations till you returned here  
My muscles would need atp anarobic respiration  
Adenine, cidozine, guanine, and thianine  
Might make up my dna  
But my love gene must be missin' from it's station  
  
I'm in the lonely lab of broken hearts  
I dissect the way you say goodbye until it falls apart  
I'm in the lonely lab of feelin' blue  
And my pheremones can find no trace of you  
  
The metallurgist is the musicians best friend. This statement  
Has been echoed throughout the ages, for without the metallurgist, we  
Could not have such musical things as triangles, cymbals, margerine  
Tubs, or guitar strings. Guitar strings are produced by the  
Wire-drawing process, where solid metal is pulled through dies with  
Progressively smaller diameters, until the desired diameter, or guage,  
Is reached. The ability to be drawn into wires is called ductility,  
And seperates metals from other materials, such as wood, ceramics, or  
Plastic milk jugs, which are made by the blow-molding process. You  
Put the milk in later.

You stands for uranium. There are several isotopes of uranium,  
Three of which are radioactive.

Hi kids! Welcome to The Uncle Bobo Show!  
Are you ready to sing?  
Come on, let's go!  
Billy and his family  
Went on a holiday  
They went down to Florida  
To laugh and dance and play  
Bill went in for a swim  
He didn't see the harm  
But when he came back out again  
He was short an arm!  
  
'Cause Rippy The Gator went chomp, chomp, chomp!  
Rippy The Gator went chomp, chomp, chomp!  
Passing the time By ending children's lives  
Down in the bottom of the swamp, swamp, swamp  
  
Billy and his father  
Went out to play some catch  
But Billy missed the pass  
Because his arm was unattached  
The ball flew past his shoulder  
And it rolled into the swamp  
When he went wading after it  
His leg became a stump!  
  
'Cause Rippy The Gator went chomp, chomp, chomp!  
Rippy The Gator went chomp, chomp, chomp!  
Passing the time By ending children's lives  
Down in the bottom of the swamp, swamp, swamp..  
  
Billy and his father  
Joined a three-legged race  
They were tearing up the field  
No one could keep the pace  
But Billy tripped and did a flip  
And landed in the muck  
He was running out of limbs  
And also out of luck!  
  
'Cause Rippy The Gator went chomp, chomp, chomp!  
Rippy The Gator went CHOMP, chomp, chomp!  
Passing the time By ending children's lives  
Down in the bottom of the swamp, swamp, swamp  
  
Billy was all dirty  
He really had to wash  
But he couldn't use a towel  
'Cause his limbs had been gnawed off.  
He went into the water  
To get all clean and bright  
But when he was finished  
He was only half his height.  
  
'Cause Rippy The Gator went chomp, chomp, chomp!  
Rippy The Gator went chomp, chomp, chomp!  
Passing the time By ending children's lives  
Down in the bottom of the swamp, swamp, swamp..  
  
Billy's father rolled his wheelchair  
Up upon a hill  
He wanted to take Bill  
Where he would not get killed  
But he left him on a slope  
And into a swamp he rolled  
They dragged out his head  
But there was nothing down below!  
  
'Cause Rippy The Gator went chomp, chomp, chomp!  
Rippy The Gator went chomp, chomp, chomp!  
Passing the time By ending children's lives  
Down in the bottom of the swamp, swamp, swamp..  
Passing the time by ending children's lives  
Down in the bottom of the swamp  
(Down in the swamp..)

My country's bigger than most  
And if asked I boast  
'Cause I'm really proud  
So I shout it loud  
Though our numbers are few  
We will welcome you  
  
Although we don't have history  
Gold medal winning teams  
Heroes or prisoners  
World famous volcanoes  
Still what we've got's glorious  
  
'Cause we've got  
Rocks and trees  
And trees and rocks  
And rocks and trees  
And trees and rocks  
And rocks and trees  
And trees and rocks  
And rocks and trees  
And trees and rocks  
And water  
  
All right, everyone!  
  
We've got  
Rocks and trees  
And trees and rocks  
And rocks and trees  
And trees and rocks  
And rocks and trees  
And trees and rocks  
And rocks and trees  
And trees and rocks  
And water  
  
In Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada  
Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada

Who's the guy with all the tests? He's  
Sam, the guy from "Quincy"!  
A white lab jacket, a hypodermic  
Sam, the guy from "Quincy"!  
He doesn't care if you're alive or dead  
He'll perform an analysis of your head  
Find out if you've bleached your hair  
Try and fool him if you dare, he's  
Sam, the guy from "Quincy"!  
Oh yeah!  
Bop-shoo-wop, bop-bop-shoo-wop  
Bop-shoo-wop, bop-bop-shoo-wop

Although he deserves, he never gets top-billed  
Only gets the girl if she's been killed  
Always the bridesmaid, never the bride

Let me tell you a story about scary Ned  
Scariest guy to ever wet a bed  
He had hands on his arms and eyes on his head  
But they weren't his  
  
He'd go down to the market and try to scare the fish  
He said that they bothered him, they weren't his favorite dish  
Then he'd go down to the highway and pretend that he was dead  
That just the way he was, creepy scary Ned  
  
Oh oh Scary Ned  
  
Ned loved Halloween 'cause he didn't need a mask  
He'd steal the children's candy, he didn't even ask  
He'd sit right down in front of them and then he'd start to eat  
He'd tell them they were better off 'cause that stuff can rot your teeth  
  
Oh oh oh oh Scary Ned  
  
A strange glow would come from his place late into the night  
He'd watch T.V. 'til the dawn, you know that ain't right  
If he started to get tired he'd rub sauerkraut on his head  
That's just the kind of guy he was, good old scary Ned  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh Scary Ned  
  
He had a face his mother didn't love  
When people saw on the street they often said "Uughh!"  
Sometimes late at night he'd walk alone  
He'd be reciting stuff  
Bad sounding stuff  
Icky awful stuff  
But when you got to know him, he weren't so bad  
  
Oh oh Scary Ned  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh Scary Ned  
  
Oh oh Scary Ned  
He's pretty scary  
Scary Ned  
Really scary  
Scary Ned  
He's scary  
Hence the name  
Scary Ned  
I saw him yesterday  
He said "Hi"  
I got scared  
'Cause he's  
Scary Ned  
If he weren't scary  
I supposed he'd be called  
Like, Happy Ned  
And who wants to hear a song about  
Happy Ned (Happy Ned)

I have been since seventeen a shipwreck balladeer  
Tragedy and misery are what makes my career  
Watery graves are my stock and trade, but it's getting harder  
For all the boats that now do float are returning safely to the harbour  
There hasn't been a shipwreck scene since 1965  
And I find I cry each time a crew returns alive  
I only cheer when gales appear and threaten fresh disaster  
They pass by, the boat survives, only my career's in tatters  
They're building ships too good today, and I'm the one who suffers  
They don't get rent from aft to stern and their halls never rupture  
Not dashed on rocks and never tossed to heaven on a wave  
You may think it well and good but my livelihood sails away  
There once were found, twenty in town, who wrote about shipwrecks  
When boats sank lots, just like rocks, 'twas good as it gets  
But the golden ages passed away and I'm barely survivin'  
The balladeers are dead I fear and workin' in advertisin'  
They're building ships too good today and it's hurtin' me  
Why can't even one poor soul fall into the dark sea  
And be ripped apart by hungry sharks in a bloody spree  
You may think it well and good, but my livelihood sails away  
Oh the only tragedy left to sing about is me  
That government bastard's been sent to take my job from me  
That inspector's making sure the ships are seaworthy  
He can try, no way will I ever give up hope  
When he went by, I did pry a big hole in his boat  
They're building ships too good today, so I helped one along  
How sweet it is to once again hear the tortured song  
Of a man afloat a sinking boat, who knows he will die today  
You might think it bad not good, but my livelihood's here to stay  
It's here to staaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay

There's a tune inside my head  
That makes me wish that I were dead  
It keeps on going on and on  
And I don't even like this song  
I don't know where I heard it first  
But now it has become my curse  
Wish that it would go away  
But it is stuck on replay  
Go away  
Go away  
Your melody  
Is killing me  
There it is once again  
Swimming through my cranium  
Suffocating all my thoughts  
An auditory candy floss  
This musical inanity  
Driving me to insanity  
If I only had one wish  
I'd kill the person who wrote it  
Go away  
Go away  
You're a bad song  
So move along  
It's louder than it was before  
I don't think I can take much more  
So I jump and scream and shout  
Hoping I can drown it out  
But instead I trip and fall  
And bash my head upon a wall  
Wait a second where'd it go?  
What's that on the radio?  
No! No!!

Can't think of anything to sing about  
Not much out there to sing about  
The world's okay, the weather's fine  
No need to sing about that  
  
I'll sing about  
  
Sponges  
Sponges yeah!  
Sponges  
Sponges yeah yeah  
Sponges suck, sponges suck  
Sponges absorb liquid then you squeeze them out yeah!  
  
There's lots of songs of peace  
Lots of songs of love  
Even songs about peaches and Valkyries  
No songs about  
  
Tuna fish, tuna fish, tuna fish, tuna fish  
They're real big and swim in oceans  
Come in cans like hockey pucks  
Tuna got their names 'cause they don't swim in pairs!  
  
Get it? Tuna. Are there two of those fish? Nah! Two-nah! Two-nah! It's funny!
Hee hee! No? I like tuna.  
  
Sponges  
Sponges yeah!  
Sponges  
Sponges yeah yeah  
Sponges suck, sponges suck  
Sponges suck, sponges suck  
Sponges clean up dishes and sinks  
And countertops and baby's noses  
They suck up soap and when you squeeze them out they make  
Bubbles!  
Bubbles!  
Bubbles!  
  
Sponges

When I joined a band I thought my life was pretty cool  
We'd stay in hotels with room service and pools  
Sign body parts for fans  
Check into rehab and smash up the van  
But looking back I should have stayed in school.  
  
Life out on the road can be dangerous you see  
To rock stock food and smelly roadies  
Are not nearly as scary  
As that girl who's at every show  
Mouthing the words from the front row  
The stalker girl is scaring the hell out of me  
  
She's my creepy stalker girl  
I'm the centre of her whacked out crazy and delusional world  
She follows me every everywhere  
She's even got a bag with some bits of my hair  
Just go away you creepy stalker girl  
  
She says I touch her in a very special way  
But I'd never go near her now without my pepper spray  
And the voices in her head  
Said break into my house and sleep in my bed  
And they also said that shaving the cat was okay  
  
She's my creepy stalker girl  
I'm the centre of her whacked out crazy and delusional world  
She follows me every everywhere  
She's even got a bag with some bits of my hair  
Just go away you creepy stalker girl  
  
I've analyzed your handwriting and I've got some bad news  
You're manic obsessive with the band and mad issues  
And you think that all our songs  
Are about you and you're usually wrong  
Except for now this song is so about you  
You creepy stalker girl, you creepy stalker girl, you creepy stalker girl

There was an old farmer  
Who lived on a rock  
He sat in the meadow  
Just shaking his  
Fist at some boys  
Who were down by the crick  
Their feet in the water  
Their hands on their  
  
Marbles and playthings  
And at half past four  
There came a young lady  
She looked like a  
  
Pretty young creature  
She sat on the grass  
She pulled up her dress  
And she showed them her  
  
Ruffles and laces  
And white fluffy duck  
She said she was learning  
A new way to  
  
Bring up her children  
So they would not spit  
While the boys in the barnyard  
Were shoveling  
  
Refuse and litter  
From yesterday's hunt  
While the girl in the meadow  
Was rubbing her  
  
Eyes at the fellow  
Down by the dock  
He looked like a man  
With a sizable  
  
Home in the country  
With a big fence out front  
And if he asked her politely  
She'd show him her  
  
Little pet dog  
Who was subject to fits  
And maybe she'd let him  
Grab hold of her  
  
Small tender hand  
With a movement so quick  
And then she'd bend over  
And suck on his  
  
Candy, so tasty  
Made of butterscotch  
And then he'd spread whipped cream  
All over her  
  
Cookies that she had  
Left out on her shelf  
If you think this is dirty  
You can go fuck yourself!

between the icecaps of the North Pole,  
and the space of America,  
there's a country in the middle,  
known as Canada.  
where the natives all are happy,  
and the lakes are fresh and clean,  
there is no unemployment,  
and no one is mean,  
in the summer there's no mosquitoes,  
and the winters are never cold,  
there is no clear cut logging,  
and no o-zone hole.  
oh Canada your leaders are so swell,  
in Canada no one ever goes to hell,  
  
no criminals or taxes,  
and Visa never phones,  
Elvis is alive in Moose Jaw,  
but we leave him alone,  
cuz we're in Canada,  
whose army is so strong,  
in Canada,  
no one has to mow their lawn,  
no waiting for the buses,  
no standing in a line,  
the banks are all non-profit,  
and the dollar flew that 99.9,  
(that's American you know)  
so shout Canada,  
the ports are always fair,  
shout Canada,  
where mechanics never never swear,  
(talking)  
  
the rednecks and the hippies live in perfect harmony,  
growing wheat and marrow together hydroponically,  
nobody has binfulls and the sky is so clear,  
and when Jesus Christ comes back to earth,  
I know he'll be born here,  
the phone lines are never busy,  
and you're never put on hold,  
Canada's the country garbed entirely from gold,  
oh in Canada,  
everyone says please,  
in Canada,  
no one ever cuts the cheese,  
oh Canada,  
oh Canada,  
the country of love is the country for me,  
Canada,  
starts with a 'C'.

Often on the weekend I'll jump in my car  
I'll not fill up the tank although I'm going far  
And if somebody asks me if I'm going to a bar  
I'll say I'm shopping 'cross the border in the usa  
I do not go down there to buy my groceries  
I respect our farmers and our factories  
I don't believe that local means it's poor in quality  
It's just our goddamned prices are too high  
(If he stays away for just two days)  
I get one hundred dollars duty-free  
(Though it adds two more, will I claim it or)  
I don't declare the products if they're in my trunk  
(He won't declare the products if they're in his trunk)  
Although it is Canada that I call home  
I don't cheer for the Yankees when I'm in the dome  
I didn't swell with pride during the desert storm  
It's just that I don't want to pay the tax  
(It's just that he's too cheap to pay the tax)  
(Yes it's just like this, he's a loyalist)  
I'll only shop at malls that fly our flag  
(And he'll tell Bob Ray that he just won't pay)  
Unless I need my unemployment benefits  
(Get a job! Get a job! Get a job!)  
Now everybody's doing the same thing as me  
They're doing what they can to beat the gst  
They're lining up for miles at the duty-free  
So I bought a J. C. Penney store in Buffalo  
(So everybody come on down to Buffalo)  
('Cause if you stay away for just two days)  
You'll get one hundred dollars duty free  
(Though it's not at par, it will still go far)  
And it ends up in the pockets of our countryman  
(It ends up in the pockets of our countryman)

The table's set ant the turkey's out  
Christmas is here, let out a shout  
The family's gathered all about  
Christmas, Christmas is here!  
Everyone is wearing big smiles  
They all try to act nice for a while  
Then George calls his in-laws vile  
Christmas, Christmas is here!  
Always at one time of the year  
When everyone's problems disappear  
And everyone smiles from ear to ear  
Christmas, Christmas is here!  
George has been drinking a lot  
He just can't keep out of the sauce  
He says his wife's been screwing her boss  
Christmas, Christmas is here!  
Margaret throws her food in his face  
People are hungry, it's really a waste  
Then she screams, "How does that taste?"  
Christmas, Christmas is here!  
Always at one time of the year  
When everyone's problems disappear  
And everyone smiles from ear to ear  
Christmas, Christmas is here!  
George picks up the carving knife  
Weilds it around and starts to slice  
Henry cocks his shotgun twice  
Christmas, Christmas is here!  
Henry says, "Hey, what's the deal?  
Just sit down and finish your meal  
Or I'll pump you full of steel!"  
Christmas, Christmas is here!  
Always at one time of the year  
When everyone's problems disappear  
And everyone smiles from ear to ear  
Christmas, Christmas is here!  
Police arrive just after eight  
Responding to a noise complaint  
Open the door, what a grisly fate  
Christmas, Christmas is here!  
Fa la la and deck the halls  
Blood was spattered on the walls  
Merry Christmas, one and all!  
Christmas, Christmas is here!  
Always at one time of the year  
When everyone's problems disappear  
And everyone smiles from ear to ear  
Christmas, Christmas is here!  
Always at one time of the year  
When everyone's problems disappear  
And everyone smiles from ear to ear  
Christmas, Christmas is here!  
  

Young Derrick would love to take my order  
He works at the coffee place just up the street  
He's happy and annoying with a smirk the size of Texas  
He's my coffee enemy  
Would you like a mochacino?  
Or perhaps a cappucino?  
Or maybe a frappucino?  
Said Derrick wearing the chinos  
All I really want is a cup of coffee  
So strong the spoon stands up just a cup of coffee  
All I really want is a cup of coffee  
Give me a friggin' cup of coffee, Derrick  
You should try out biscotti  
Or a low-cal cabbage cookie  
This muffin's only 3.50  
And what's super great is that it's fat free  
Don't wanna smell like an espresso  
With your coffee scented soap  
Maybe you should have some chai tea  
Or maybe join me in some tai chi  
All I really want is a cup of coffee  
In a non-biodegradable cup just a cup of coffee  
All I really want is a cup of coffee  
Give me a friggin' cup of coffee  
Oh Derrick why won't you listen to me  
I don't want a magazine or a CD  
I don't want a latte or a frappe  
Just give me a coffee that doesn't taste crappe  
All I really want is a cup of coffee (3X)  
Give me a friggin' cup of coffee  
All I really want (3X)  
Give me a friggin' cup of coffee, Derrick

Best things in life are not free  
But you don't need to have money  
To get the things that you want to own  
You just have to get a loan  
When you buy, small or large  
Just put it on your credit card  
You can live like a king  
Not paying for a single thing  
  
Put it on credit and then forget it  
Don't let it bother you no more, no more  
Put it on credit and then forget it  
And go back to the store  
  
Every night I pray and thank  
God above for creating the banks  
They have been so kind to me  
With their bounless generosity  
  
If you cannot make your payments  
Well, do like the national governments  
And you can pay off what you owe  
By taking out a bigger loan  
  
You gotta put it on credit and then forget it  
Don't let it bother you no more, no more  
Put it on credit and then forget it  
And go back to the store  
  
Now I seem to have men after me  
From the collection agency  
And the bank came by the other day  
Took everything I own away  
  
Now I think that it is plain to see  
That I must declare bankruptcy  
But things aren't really all that bad  
I can borrow from my dad  
  
And put it on credit and then forget it  
Don't let it bother you no more, no more  
Put it on credit and then forget it  
And go back to the store  
  
You gotta put it on credit and then forget it  
Don't let it bother you no more, no more  
Put it on credit and then forget it  
And go back to the store

It's early in the morning, way before dawn  
I down a cup of coffee put my lucky hat on  
Get down to the water, before all the crowds  
Gonna have more fun than the law allows  
With my hot rod, I go out to prove  
When I'm on the prowl, I never lose  
I fire up my Merc and put the throttle down  
'Cause I've got the fastest fishing boat in town  
I open up my tackle box, it's so big!  
Crank baits, sink baits, beer and jigs  
Got my bobbers on, and my 10 pound test  
Gonna catch me a lunker gonna be the best  
(Gonna go fishing) Gonna have some fun  
(Gonna go fishing) 'Cause it's number one  
(Gonna go fishing) Gonna sit on my butt  
(Gonna catch a fish) And scrape out its guts  
Ahhh, fishing!  
I fish on the lake, by the sunken tree stump  
Between the sewage output, and the chemical dump  
Don't swim in the lake, says a sign on a tree  
It's a good thing that fish can't read  
I got my 10 dollar lure, the one that floats  
And I make a big cast from my 20 grand boat  
With my thousand dollar rod, or maybe it's more  
Gonna catch me a fish that's 5 bucks at the store  
(Gonna go fishing) Gonna have some fun  
(Gonna go fishing) 'Cause it's number one  
(Gonna go fishing) Gonna sit on my butt  
(Gonna catch a fish) And scrape out its guts  
Ahhh, fishing!  
I feel something tugging on the end of my line  
(Tug, tug, tug, tug, tug that line)  
I'm gonna catch a fish, it's gonna be so fine  
(Fish, fish, fish, fish, fish so fine)  
Oh it feels so good to touch fish slime  
(Slime, slime, slime, slime, fishy slime)  
There's nothing else to do with my free time  
(Time, time, time, time, waste of time)  
[Guitar solo]  
Let's catch a fishfishfishfishfishfishfishfishfishfishfishfishfish  
Eat a fishfishfishfishfishfishfishfishfishfishfishfishfish  
Swallow a fishfishfishfishfishfishfishfishfishfishfishfishfish  
Digest a fishfishfishfishfishfishfishfishfishfishfishfishfish  
Out comes the fishfishfishfishfishfishfishfishfishfishfishfishfish  
It was a fishfishfishfishfishfishfishfishfishfishfishfishfish  
(Gonna go fishing) Gonna have some fun  
(Gonna go fishing) 'Cause it's number one  
(Gonna go fishing) Gonna sit on my butt  
(Gonna catch a fish) And scrape out its guts  
Ahhh--  
(Gonna go fishing) Gonna have some fun  
(Gonna go fishing) 'Cause it's number one  
(Gonna go fishing) Gonna sit on my butt  
(Gonna catch a fish) And scrape out its guts  
Ahhh, fish-fish-fishing see-A-N-A-D-A!  

Through the ages, through war, pestilence and sleet, the Celtic culture has
survived, it's songs and dances passed from father to son, from mother to
daughter, from uncle to goat. And though few still speak Gaelic, the ancient
language of the Celts, all hearts are still stirred by the beautiful tones of
this mellifluous tongue.  
  
Ah ma wee hach patew mae bo clee hach maneagh  
Heow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow bark meow  
Saigh hough loo loo cheow dach hagh vreigh chouach mouheaugh  
Douauh meah mae couchah moo ma meagh pach hooragh  
  
And though other cultures tried to destroy them, driven no doubt by their
jealousy of the Celts' fine fashion sense and edible cuisine, they did not
surrender. Actually, they surrendered quite often, but they were never
entirely wiped out, clinging to the corners of small islands, their voices
raised in song, the clarion call of the pipes ringing out to the heavens.  
  
(Undescribably beautiful penny-whistle solo)  
  
Ah ma wee hach patew mae bo clee hach maneagh  
Heow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow bark meow  
Saigh hough loo loo cheow dach hagh vreigh chouach mouheaugh  
Douauh meah mae couchah moo ma meagh pach hooragh

I used to be a farmer and I made a living fine  
I had a little stretch of land along the C.P. Line  
But times were hard, and though I tried, the money wasn't there  
And bankers came and took my land, and told me "fair is fair".  
  
I looked for every kind of job, the answer always no  
"Hire you now," they'd always laugh, "we just let twenty go!"  
The government they promised me a measly little sum  
But I've got too much pride to end up just another bum  
  
Then I thought, who gives a damn if all the jobs are gone,  
I'm gonna be a pirate on the river Saskatchewan.  
  
'Cause it's a heave-ho, high-ho, coming down the Plains  
Stealing wheat and barley and all the other grains  
And it's a ho-hey, high-hey, farmers bar your doors  
When you see the Jolly Roger on Regina's mighty shores  
  
You'd think the local farmers would know that I'm at large  
But just the other day I saw an unsuspecting barge  
I snuck up right behind them and they were none the wiser  
I rammed their ship and sank it, and I stole their fertilizer.  
  
A bridge outside of Moose Jaw spans a mighty river  
Farmers cross in so much fear their stomachs are a-quiver  
'Cause they know that Tractor Jack is waiting in the bay,  
I'll jump the bridge and knock them cold and sail off with their hay.  
  
'Cause it's a heave-ho, high-ho, coming down the Plains  
Stealing wheat and barley and all the other grains  
And it's a ho-hey, high-hey, farmers bar your doors  
When you see the Jolly Roger on Regina's mighty shores  
  
Well, Mountie Bob he chased me, he was always at my throat  
He followed on the shoreline, 'cause he didn't own a boat,  
But cutbacks were a-coming and the Mountie lost his job  
So now he's sailing with me and we call him Salty Bob.  
  
A swinging sword, a skull-and-bones, and pleasant company,  
I never pay my income tax and screw the G.S.T. (Screw it!)  
Prince Albert down to Saskatoon, the terror of the sea  
If you want to reach the Co-op, boy, you gotta get by me!  
  
'Cause it's a heave-ho, high-ho, coming down the Plains  
Stealing wheat and barley and all the other grains  
And it's a ho-hey, high-hey, farmers bar your doors  
When you see the Jolly Roger on Regina's mighty shores  
  
Well pirate life's appealing but you don't just find it here  
I heard that in Alberta there's a band of buccaneers  
They roam the Athabasca from Smith to Fort McKay  
And you're bound to lose your Stetson if you have to pass their way  
  
Well, winter is a-coming and a chill is in the breeze  
My pirate days are over once the river starts to freeze  
I'll be back in springtime, but now I've got to go  
I hear there's lots of plundering down in New Mexico.  
  
'Cause it's a heave-ho, high-ho, coming down the Plains  
Stealing wheat and barley and all the other grains  
And it's a ho-hey, high-hey, farmers bar your doors  
When you see the Jolly Roger on Regina's mighty shores  
  
'Cause it's a heave-ho, high-ho, coming down the Plains  
Stealing wheat and barley and all the other grains  
And it's a ho-hey, high-hey, farmers bar your doors  
When you see the Jolly Roger on Regina's mighty shores  
When you see the Jolly Roger on Regina's mighty shores

When you hear that I'm a cowboy  
And I work the cattle trail  
You probably assume I'm big and tough (big and tough)  
But the trail's worn me down  
I don't wanna hang around  
I've just about had enough (had enough)  
Ya see, I like a nice cup of Espresso  
And I like to read my People magazine  
I co-ordinate my chaps  
But everybody laughs  
And say they don't like that shade of green  
Oh no, it's true  
I'm a sensitive cowboy and I don't know what to do  
Oh no, it's kinda strange  
I'm the last sensitive cowboy on the range  
Well I try to eat a healthy balanced diet  
But they all eat their brown beans from the can  
They all have to smoke about 6 packs a day  
You'd think they was the Marlboro man  
And they don't like to go to see the opera  
On Friday nights when they get paid  
And they don't help me bring in the hanging plants  
Every time there's a Native American raid  
Oh no, it's true  
I'm a sensitive cowboy and I don't know what to do  
Oh no, it's kinda strange  
I'm the last sensitive cowboy on the range  
Cowboy life sure is different these days..  
Why brand your cattle when you can just use bovine psychology?  
Why have a gunfight when there are so many good paralegals out there?  
Nobody drinks in bushwhacks anymore. Besides, we're all switching  
Over to equal-salt produced tofu jerkey. And if you're gonna ride off  
Into the sunset, make sure you're using an effective sunblock.  
Oh no, it's true  
I'm a sensitive cowboy and I don't know what to do  
Oh no, it's kinda strange  
I'm the last sensitive cowboy on  
Oh no, it's true  
I'm a sensitive cowboy and I don't know what to do  
Oh no, it's kinda strange  
I'm the last sensitive cowboy on the range  

A Scotsman clad in kilts, left the bar one evening fair  
And one could tell by how he walked he'd drunk more than his share  
He staggered on until he could no longer keep his feet  
Then he stumbled off into the grass to sleep beside the street.  
Oh, Ring-ding diddle diddle aye-dee-oh  
Ring di-diddle oh day  
He stumbled off into the grass to sleep beside the street.  
  
Well later on two young and lovely girls just happened by  
And one says to the other, with a twinkle in her eye  
"Oh see yon sleepy Scotsman, so strong and handsome built?"  
" I wonder if it's true what they don't wear beneath the kilt."  
Oh, Ring-ding diddle diddle aye-dee-oh  
Ring di-diddle- oh day  
", I wonder if it's true what they don't wear beneath the kilt."  
  
So they creeped up to the sleeping Scotsman, quiet as could be  
And they lifted up his kilt above the waist so they could see  
And there behold, for them to view, beneath his Scottish skirt,  
Twas nothing but what God had blessed him with upon his birth.  
Oh Ring-ding diddle diddle aye-dee-oh  
Ring di-diddle-oh day  
Twas nothing but what God had blessed him with upon his birth.  
  
Well they marveled for a moment, then one said, "We best be gone."  
"But let's leave a present for our friend before we move along."  
So as a gift, they left a blue silk ribbon tied into a bow  
Around the bonnie star the Scot's kilt lifted showed.  
Oh Ring-ding diddle diddle aye-dee-oh  
Ring di-diddlee-oh day  
Around the bonnie star the Scot's kilt lifted show.  
  
When the Scotsman woke to nature's call, he stumbled towards the trees  
Behind the bush, he lifts his kilt, and he gawks at what he sees,  
And in a startled voice, he says to what's before his eyes,  
"My friend, I don't know where you've been, but I see you won first prize!  
Oh Ring-ding diddle diddle aye-dee-oh  
Ring di-diddlee-oh day  
"My friend, I don't know where you've been, but I see you won first prize!"

I bought a ticket to Austrailia, for my holidays,  
Got my boarding pass, found out at last,  
That I was seated in the middle of the row.  
The buisness man beside me smelled like Old Spice, and Gin.  
The lady to my left was talkin bout her grandchildren.  
Two kids behind me were screamin for their mum.  
She was screamin back,  
"Wonder how come?"  
  
I got the worst seat on the plane,  
By the time I land I'll be insane.  
My legs are startin to go numb, and,  
I just wanna kill someone.  
I got the worst seat on the plane,  
Bladders full, my back's a pain,  
Next time I have somewhere to go,  
Think I'll ride my bicycle.  
  
I can't go to sleep, 'cause the pillow's too damn awkward,  
So I try to watch the movie, but it starred Kevin Costner.  
Earphones hurt my head, and the reading lamp was dead,  
Then the pilot said "Turbulence is on the way."  
My food try was now on my lap,  
The old lady beside me had a heart attack,  
Children screamed so loud I thought my skull would crack,  
Buisness man turned blue, blew up on my back!  
  
I got the worst seat on the plane,  
Time I land I'll be insane,  
My legs are startin to go numb, and,  
I just wanna kill someone!  
I got the worst seat on the plane,  
Bladders full, my back's a pain  
Next time I have somewhere to go,  
Think I'll just rent the video!  
  
After seven hours I can take no more.  
So I try to open the Emergency door,  
But the flight attendant, tackled me to the floor,  
She said "Go back to your seat dear."  
I said "I'd rather get off here."  
  
I got the worst seat on the plane,  
I think I am now insane,  
My legs are both completely numb, and,  
I want to kill everyone!  
I got the worst seat on the plane,  
Bladder's full, my back's a pain.  
The next time I get Wonderlust,  
I think that I'll just take the bus.  
  
I got the worst seat on the plane,  
Got the worst seat on the plane,  
Gottheworstseatontheplane!  
  
I got the worst seat on the plane (Yeah!)  
Got the worst seat on the plane (Yeah!)  
Fellas I got the worstseatonthepla-a-ane!

When Christmas rolls around Santa's busy in his shop  
Managing his elves and trying to cut costs  
His plant is out of date it needs modernization  
He has quite a large debt accumulation  
Elves are expensive, they do not come cheap  
And you would not believe the bills for the heat  
Santa stands to lose everything he owns  
If he defaults on yet another of his loans  
Things are looking bad for Santa  
He can slip down chimneys but he can't balance accounts  
Things are looking bad for Santa  
If he wrote a cheque it probably would bounce  
He hires an accountant to come and advise  
The accountant says that he has been unwise  
'cause even if the costs were cut down drastically  
It's still hard to make money giving things away for free  
Santa Claus decides to wipe the slate clean  
He lays off half the elves and buys mordern machines  
Then he auctions off all unnecessary stock  
He gets a lot for Rudolf from Ripley's believe it or not  
Things are looking bad for Santa  
He's made all sorts of changes but it hasn't fixed a thing  
Things are looking bad for Santa  
Missus Claus has left him and the elves are picketing  
Hey! Hey! Ho! Ho! The big fat pig has got to go!  
Hey! Hey! Ho! Ho! The big fat pig has got to go!  
Santa's had enough he locks the elves outside  
He butchers all the reindeer and sells off all their hides  
He sells his shop to Disney and leaves the north pole  
To go find cheaper labour down in Mexico  

I had a love that was so bright  
I used to dream of her each night  
And then rush to her side every morning (oooh)  
I had her all to myself  
We never noticed anyone else  
We didn't even hear the radio warnings  
Our love was no joke, you know  
It was the talk of downtown Tokyo  
We'll be happy forever, I promised her  
But just as I proposed, her feet  
Were made to touch her nose  
As she was crushed by a Japanese monster  
(ohhh-ohhh-ohhh-AAAAAAGH! GODZILLA!)  
Our love was so true  
But now she's 3 foot 2  
And she used to be 5 foot 11  
Her death was unintentional  
But now she's 2-dimensional  
My angel is truly in heaven  
She's the one I kiss and hug  
Till she was crushed like a bug  
I guess it's hard to see a monster above you  
She said she'd save her heart for me  
But now it's there for all to see  
And her last words to me were, "I AAAAAGGHH!"  
Our love was so true  
But now she's 3 foot 2  
And she used to be 5 foot 11  
Her death was unintentional  
But now she's 2-dimensional  
My angel is truly in heaven  
(Take it George!)  
[Guitar solo consisting entirely of glissandos]  
She was young (so young)  
And sweet (so sweet)  
But now she's part (she's part)  
Of the street (the street)  
And I want (so much)  
To have her back (come back)  
So I'll get a putty knife  
So I can scrape her from the crack  
(Oh. You might need a wider brush.)  
Our love was so true  
But now she's 3 foot 2  
And she used to be 5 foot 11  
Her death was unintentional  
But now she's 2-dimensional  
My angel is truly in heaven  
My angel is truly in heaven  
My angel is truly in heaven  

I hate the skydome and the cn Tower too  
I hate Nathan Phillips Square and the Ontario Zoo  
The rents too high, the airs unclean  
The beaches are dirty and the people are mean  
And the women are big and the men are dumb  
And the children are loopy 'cause they live in a slum  
The water is polluted and the mayor's a dork  
They dress real bad and they think they're New York  
In Toronto, Ontario  
  
"You know, actually I think I hate all of Ontario"  
  
I hate Thunder Bay and Ottawa  
Kitchener, Windsor, and Oshawa  
London sucks and the Great Lakes suck  
And Sarnia sucks and Turkey Point Sucks  
  
I took a trip to ontario to visit Brian Mulrooney  
He beat me up and he stole my pants and he put me in a tree  
I went to see the Maple Leafs and got hit in the head with a puck  
  
"I don't even know how they did it, I was playing the orgon at the time!"  
  
Ontariio Sucks  
  
"actually, now tha I really think about it, I think I pretty much hate every
gosh darn province and territory in our country!Except Alberta, yeah I love
Alberta, lots of cows, trees, rocks, dirt"  
  
I hate Newfoundland 'cause they talk so weird  
And Prince Edward Island is too small  
Nova Scotia's dumb 'cause it's the name of a bank  
New Brunswick doesn't have a good mall  
Quebec is revolting and it makes me mad  
Ontario sucks, Ontario sucks,  
  
"Manitoba's population density is 1.9 people per square kilometer. NOw isn't
that stupid!?"  
  
Saskatchewan is boring and the people are old  
And as for the territories, they're too cold!  
  
And the only really good thing about the province of British Columbia is that
it's right next to us! "  
  
'cause Alberta doesn't suck  
But Calgary does

Oh my darling I sure loved that meal  
Though I could still taste the pig squeal  
Now I'm weak and losing focus  
I think you gave me trichinosis  
Trichinosis is little worms that dig  
And burrow through your body after you eat raw pig  
I love you hon but can't help but notice  
That you gave me trichinosis  
By candlelight I ate that pork  
I couldn't see danger on my fork  
Oh if you do love me completely  
Never again feed me food that will eat me  
Now I feel kinda strange inside like I'm in an apartment  
With tenants I just can't seem to evict  
Theyre having a party and I'm the buffet  
I love you darling but Id be lying  
If I didn't tell you this was eating me up inside

There's nothing good on the T. V (On his trip to Greece)  
And there's no toga parties(On his trip to Greece)  
So I see the ruins there(On his trip to Greece)  
They could sure use some repair(On his trip to Greece)  
The first day all I eat is lots and lots of souvlaki  
For it's the only word that I can speak  
But it goes right through me, which is bad, because Greek  
Plumbing peaked in 400 B. C  
Get souvenirs for my Ma(On his trip to Greece)  
That were made in China(On his trip to Greece)  
Then down to the beach I go(On his trip to Greece)  
To see something cultural(On his trip to Greece)  
For I had heard the girls sunbathe in the European way  
A bigger fan of that you'll never find  
When I see that it's true, I take off my top too  
My pasty body making them all blind  
I get water in my ear(On his trip to Greece)  
Which makes it kind of hard to hear(On his trip to Greece)  
It isn't bad 'cause already(On his trip to Greece)  
All they say is Greek to me  
He thinks this joke is so funny  
That he says repeatedly(On his trip to Greece)  
I thought I drank a bottle full of water but it was ouzo,  
Now I'm going to pass out in the sand  
Oh, if once again the mood hits me to go to some foreign country  
I am going to go to Disneyland

This year at Christmas, everybody's feeling funny  
No one's making joyful sounds  
Cranberry sauce ain't staying down  
The lineups at the bathroom are longer than at the mall  
Everybody's meeting Vincent  
The Christmas Virus  
Vincent the Christmas Virus  
He's the one that'll keep you up all night  
He's the festive parasite  
Vincent the Christmas Virus  
Vincent the Christmas Virus is resistant to penicillin  
Doesn't notice Aspirin  
Don't matter if you're fit and trim  
But Vincent's not immune to the effects of alcohol  
So get real drunk on Christmas Day  
Let's all toast to Vincent (Hooray!)  

Walter Gretzky had a son  
He grew up to be the great one  
He came from Brantford Ontario  
He liked Gordie Howe you know  
Americans don't understand  
The national sport of the north land  
The world's fastest game they always dissin'  
But they don't know what they are missin'  
If they'd just watch Wayne Gretzky play  
Then they'd watch hockey everyday  
Actually I like the Hawks  
But boy oh boy Wayne Gretzky rocks  
  
When I lived in Edmonton  
He made us the City of Champions  
With Jari and Semenko by his side  
He filled our frigid city with pride  
Then he moved out to L. A.  
To help bring hockey to the you. S. A.  
Everyone hated Peter and Janet  
For trading the best player on the planet  
They traded him and sure enough  
He took the Kings to the Stanley Cup  
Actually I like the Hawks  
But boy oh boy Wayne Gretzky rocks  
  
He came from Brantford Ontario  
His rival's name is Mario  
Actually I like the Hawks  
But boy oh boy Wayne Gretzky rocks

The US is the eagle, Russia is the bear,  
Australia is the kangaroo, cause they're kind of weird down there.  
Yeah, India is the tiger, that stands so proud and tall,  
But Canada is the greatest of them all.  
  
We are the beaver, we're furry and we're free  
Yeah, we are the beaver, we got two big front teeth  
Yeah, we are the beaver, we can chew right through small trees  
We are the beaver, we are the beaver, we are the beaver.  
  
You might think a rodent is a pretty lame choice  
For a national animal, but don't you listen to that voice.  
No, cause all them birds and predators, just take from the land  
But the beaver, always gives a dam.  
  
We are the beaver, we got cute little webbed feet  
Yeah, we are the beaver, it's bark we like to eat  
Yeah, we are the beaver, a nickel we complete.  
Yeah, we are the beaver, we are the beaver, we are the beaver.  
  
The eagle flies the sky above and swoops down on its prey  
The big bear will maul anyone who dares gets in its way  
The tiger is the greatest of the hunters today.  
But the beaver it can build dams. Yeah,  
The beaver it can build dams, dams, dams.  
  
We are the beaver, we slap our tails when danger's nearby  
We are the beaver, we got waterproof hides  
Yeah, we are the beaver, we got big bums and beady eyes.  
We are the beaver, we are the beaver, we are the beaver.  
  
We are the beaver, our name is often used as a double entedre  
We are the beaver, cause in Canada, both French and English belong  
Yeah, we are the beaver, and the subject of this song is  
We are the beaver, we are the beaver, we are the beaver.  
I can't hear you.  
We are the beaver, we are the beaver, we are the beaver  
Are you getting the point?  
We are the beaver, we are the beaver.  
We are the beaver

I never much believed in reincarnation  
Thought it was only people's imagination  
But now I'm forced into some reconsideration  
'Cause something's happened to my cat  
That deserves some explanation  
William Shakespeare's in my cat  
My kitty is the bard  
He used to be a playwright  
Now he's digging up the yard  
He's still a cat in most respects  
He likes to meow and purr  
But now I introduce him as the cat  
That wrote Richard the third  
I took him to see Phantom  
He said it was quite nice  
But he can't go see Miss Saigon  
Until he kills some mice  
(Until he kills some mice)  
William Shakespeare's in my cat  
It sometimes seems so deep  
The guy who wrote Twelfth Night  
Chews on my socks while I'm asleep  
I'm really quite impressed  
I own the cat who wrote MacBeth  
But if something's rotten in this state  
It's just his fishy breath  
'Cause he wrote Romeo and Juliet  
But his greatest story yet  
Is coming back as someone's pet  
And gettin' neutered by the vet  
He got his paws caught in a net  
Then he said to be or not to meeeow!  
William Shakespeare's in my cat  
He rarely ever talks  
He makes his loudest statements  
Standing in the litter box  
He sleeps on all my shelves  
And throws my books about the house  
It doesn't sound like prose  
When he bats a squeaky mouse  
Sam Beckett's plays are witty,  
Same thing for Bernard Shaw,  
Oscar Wilde is pretty,  
But none of them have paws  
(None of them have paws)  
William Shakespeare's in my cat  
He chases bits of fluff  
John Milton's in my goldfish  
But I never liked his stuff  
I'm thinking that Franz Kafka  
Really came back as a bug  
And I hope Andrew Lloyd Webber  
Will stay underneath my rug  
'Cause he wrote Romeo and Juliet  
But his greatest story yet  
Is coming back as someone's pet  
And gettin' neutered by the vet  
He got his paws caught in a net  
Then he said to be or not to meeeow!  
Take it, Trevor!  
He wrote Romeo and Juliet  
But his greatest story yet  
Is coming back as someone's pet  
And gettin' neutered by the vet  
He got his paws caught in a net  
Then he said to be or not to meeeow!  

Oh the Wolfe Island Ferry is a very nice ferry  
It's a very nice ferry it's the Wolfe Island Ferry  
The Wolfe Island Ferry is a very nice ferry  
It's a very nice ferry, it's the Wolfe Island Ferry!  
Oh the Wolfe Island Ferry is a very nice ferry  
It's a very nice ferry it's the Wolfe Island Ferry  
The Wolfe Island Ferry is a very nice ferry  
It's a very nice ferry, it's the Wolfe Island Ferry!  
General Wolfe beat General Montcalm on the Plains of Abraham  
And because of this, they liked him an awful lot in Kingston  
The town was named Kingston in the county Frontenac  
So they spotted an island, and they called it Wolfe Island!  
Oh, it's got a couple highways and a really nice restaurant  
Called the "General Wolfe", and it's named after General Wolfe  
Who won a couple of battles and had an island named after him  
It's a really nice place and a good port to smuggle booze in from the States  
Oh the Wolfe Island Ferry is a very nice ferry  
It's a very nice ferry it's the Wolfe Island Ferry  
The Wolfe Island Ferry is a very nice ferry  
It's a very nice ferry, it's the Wolfe Island Ferry!  
Oh, the Wolfe Island Ferry doesn't carry any wolves  
Or any source of animals, except for a couple of seagulls  
Who are really lazy, and so they land on the ferry  
And that way, they don't have to fly all the way to Wolfe Island  
Oh, the Wolfe Island Ferry doesn't carry any fairies  
Cause fairies, unlike seagulls, don't really mind the flying  
They fly over to Wolfe Island sprinkling fairy dust all over  
Except it's really more like battery acid and it burns your skin until you die  
Well, they've got lots of potatos and Anne of Green Gables  
Oh crap, that's Prince Edward Island  
Sometimes I get confused when I switch my medication  
But I can see the bunny!  
Oh the Wolfe Island Ferry is a very nice ferry  
It's a very nice ferry it's the Wolfe Island Ferry  
The Wolfe Island Ferry is a very nice ferry  
It's a very nice ferry, it's the Wolfe Island Ferry!

I'm feeling hungry, empty tummy, and I want to make it full  
So I spend the day at Wong's buffet and I eat till I explode  
  
There's sixty types of Oriental delights, I gotta have them all  
Chicken wings and onion rings, and sweet and sour balls  
  
At Wong's, come and sail with me  
At Wong's, on the sea of gluttony  
At Wong's, eat until it hurts  
But don't forget there's pudding for dessert  
  
The chicken's tough, the noodles are rough  
And the chow mein's three days old  
But it's quantity not quality that has got my soul  
  
So fill that plate, no mistake, there's no holding back  
I won't stop until I got a packed digestive tract  
  
A Wong's, no meal is a loss  
At Wong's covered in red sauce  
At Wong's, everything is battered  
And what's inside doesn't even matter  
  
Stop! Oh. Second plate! Huh! Third plate! Oh.  
Fourth plate. Oh. Dessert. Ug.  
Fortune cookie. I ate the fortune.  
  
I try to leave, I want to heave, my whole body hurts  
Can barely stand, I tell you man, I got my money's worth  
  
If I get the time I'm going to go to China  
And eat at their ancient buffets  
But I'm wonderin', how they stay so thin  
Eating like this every day  
  
At Wong's, give chopsticks a try  
At Wong's, to pick up your french fry  
At Wong's, you know I'm coming back  
Eating here's worth the heart attack  
Wong's Chinese Buffet
