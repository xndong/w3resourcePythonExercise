You told me all i would need was a little time  
But getting over you is still such an uphill climb  
I know i ought to be living in the present tense  
But the past i had with you was the last time  
My life made sense  
  
[Chorus:]  
Call me crazy-for hurting this way  
Call me crazy-go on and say  
It's a phase i'm going through  
Call me crazy-crazy over you  
  
I know you don't really mean to be so unkind  
But pardon me if i'm not in the right frame of mind  
To go on hearing how i should start all over again  
Face the future without you-  
I wouldn't know how to begin  
  
(repeat chorus)  
Bridge:  
You say I'm lost in a fantasy  
But what we had was real to me  
Call me crazy  
  
Go on and say  
It's a phase I'm going through  
Call me crazy-crazy over you  
Call me crazy

Saw you come through them swingin' doors  
Had 'em hangin' on ya  
Couldn't hold one more  
You walked by with a silly grin  
They were kissin' all over your chinny chin chin  
  
Eugene you genius  
What book did you read  
That made you so smart  
You could steal a heart  
Anytime that you please  
Eugene you genius  
Could you teach me  
  
It's more than the way you comb your hair  
That's makin' all the pretty girls stop and stare  
Tell me Eugene I just gotta know  
Can I go down and buy it at the grocery store  
  
Is it something that you tell 'em  
Love letters that you mail 'em  
Your secrets safe with me  
To get those of kind of glances  
Do you have to take classes  
For a master romeo degree

(I do swear that I'll always be there. I'd give anything and everything  
and I will always care. Through weakness and strength, happiness and  
sorrow, for better or worse, I will love you with every beat of my  
heart.)  
  
From this moment life has begun  
From this moment you are the one  
Right beside you  
is where I belong  
From this moment on  
  
From this moment I have been blessed  
I live only for your happiness  
And for your love I'd give my last breath  
From this moment on  
  
I give my hand to you with all my heart  
Can't wait to live my life with you, can't wait to start  
You and I will never be apart  
My dreams came true because of you  
  
From this moment as long as I live  
I will love you, I promise you this  
There is nothing I wouldn't give  
From this moment on  
  
You're the reason I believe in love  
And you're the answer to my prayers from up above  
All we need is just the two of us  
My dreams came true because of you  
  
From this moment as long as I live  
I will love you, I promise you this  
There is nothing I wouldn't give  
From this moment  
I will love you  
I will love you as long as I live  
From this moment on

[Verse 1]  
For all the times I felt cheated, I complained  
You know how I love to complain  
For all the wrongs I repeated, though I was to blame  
I still cursed that rain  
I didn't have a prayer, didn't have a clue  
Then out of the blue  
  
[Chorus]  
God gave me you to show me what's real  
There's more to life and just how I feel  
And all that I'm worth is right before my eyes  
And all that I live for though I didn't know why  
Now I do, 'cause God gave me you  
  
[Verse 2]  
For all the times I wore my self pity like a favorite shirt  
All wrapped up in that hurt  
For every glass I saw, I saw half empty  
Now it overflows like a river through my soul  
From every doubt I had, I'm finally free  
And I truly believe  
  
[Chorus]  
God gave me you to show me what's real  
There's more to life and just how I feel  
And all that I'm worth is right before my eyes  
And all that I live for though I didn't know why  
Now I do, 'cause God gave me you  
  
[Verse 3]  
In your arms I'm someone new  
With ever tender kiss from you  
Oh must confess  
I've been blessed  
  
[Chorus]  
God gave me you to show me what's real  
There's more to life and just how I feel  
And all that I'm worth is right before my eyes  
And all that I live for though I didn't know why (didn't know why)  
Now I do (I finally do), 'cause God gave me you (God gave me You)  
  
[Outro]  
God gave me you

For all the times I felt cheated, I complained  
You know how I love to complain  
For all the wrongs I repeated, though I was to blame  
I still cursed that rain  
I didn't have a prayer, didn't have a clue  
Then out of the blue  
  
God gave me you to show me what's real  
There's more to life than just how I feel  
And all that I'm worth is right before my eyes  
And all that I live for though I didn't know why  
Now I do, 'cause God gave me you  
  
For all the times I wore my self pity like a favorite shirt  
All wrapped up in that hurt  
For every glass I saw, I saw half empty  
Now it overflows like a river through my soul  
From every doubt I had, I'm finally free  
I truly believe  
  
God gave me you to show me what's real  
There's more to life than just how I feel  
And all that I'm worth is right before my eyes  
And all that I live for though I didn't know why  
Now I do, 'cause God gave me you  
  
In your arms I'm someone new  
With ever tender kiss from you  
Oh, must confess  
I've been blessed  
  
God gave me you to show me what's real  
There's more to life than just how I feel  
And all that I'm worth is right before my eyes  
And all that I live for though I didn't know why  
(Didn't know why)  
Now I do, 'cause God gave me you  
(I finally do, God gave me you)  
  
God gave me you

At first I thought it was the moonlight shining through the mist  
Cause after all a kiss is just a kiss or so I thought  
But I must have been wrong  
It could have been the music cause it sounded so sweet  
Something sure was sweeping me off of my feet  
All night long, it sure was strong  
Before I knew what was going on, I was going, going, gone  
I suppose it could have the perfume from a honey-suckle vine  
Something sure was driving me out of my mind  
But I should have known all along  
It was your love and it was so strong  
I was going, going, gone  
It might have been the magic written in the stars  
Some gypsy might have read it somewhere in the cards  
It really doesn't matter cause whatever it was  
It led me straight to your arms  
First I thought it was the moonlight shining through the mist  
After all a kiss is just a kiss or so I thought (so I thought)  
But I must have been wrong  
Before I knew what was going on  
I was going, going, gone  
Going, going, gone  
Going, going, gone

One lonely night  
I sent a prayer  
Send me someone  
Someone to care  
Out of the blue  
Suddenly you  
Heaven sent  
  
One magic touch  
One stolen kiss  
My only dream  
My every wish  
That's when I knew  
That it was truly  
Heaven sent  
  
And every star in the sky  
They knew that I  
Had waited my whole life through  
And as I held you tight  
They shined even brighter  
So glad I'd finally found you  
And through the years  
Never forget  
The love we'd found  
The night we met  
And how we knew  
That it was truly  
Heaven sent

I'm sitting here inside this stranger's place  
And time is racing by  
I've been way out here for a month or more  
Tonight I'm wondering why  
You try to understand the things that I feel  
Maybe this time I'll find a way to explain it  
Cause there is a dream deep inside my head  
And it may seem like it's breaking the thread  
That holds me to you  
Still you have never wanted to change me  
But darling I know though we're far apart  
The signal is strong  
This helpless heart will always belong to you  
To you  
This power takes me from the place I belong  
To where only the strong get through  
You've got keep on believing or you'll lose your way  
Cause it slips right out of view  
Though there are days the light can flicker and fade  
Here in this place tonight a fire is burning  
Cause there is a dream deep inside my head  
And it may seem like it's breaking the thread  
That holds me to you  
Still you have never wanted to change me  
But believe me I know though we're far apart  
The signal is strong  
This helpless heart will always belong to you  
This helpless heart will always belong to you  
Will always belong to you  
To you  
Only to you  
To you

'Silent Night', 'Snowy Night', 'The First Noel' alone  
The only 'Jingle Bells' 'round here are on the motel phone  
She calls me, comforts me, holding back a tear  
She's wishing on that yonder star and I'm missing Christmas here  
  
At the Holiday Inn, no tinsel or mistletoe  
Holiday Inn, one bed and HBO  
The whole world is rejoicing with family and friends  
And I'm watching 'It's A Wonderful Life' at the Holiday Inn  
  
Christmas Eve used to be a peaceful dream of joy  
But as I toss and turn tonight, I hear a scuffled noise  
What's that, it can't be, it sounds kinda like reindeer  
But I really doubt the bearded one makes deliveries here  
  
At the Holiday Inn, no tinsel or mistletoe  
Holiday Inn, one bed and HBO  
The whole world is rejoicing with family and friends  
And I'm watching 'It's A Wonderful Life' at the Holiday Inn  
  
I look out the peephole, I can't believe what I see, yeah  
It's my baby in a Santa hat and she's smilin' at me  
She brings in a two foot tree and hangs a wreath on the wall  
Looks like it's gonna be a very merry after all  
  
Holiday Inn with tinsel and mistletoe  
Holiday Inn, one bed and HBO  
The whole world is rejoicing with family and friends  
And we're watching 'It's A Wonderful Life' at the Holiday Inn  
Yeah, and it's a wonderful life at the Holiday Inn

You say you need someone to love  
But when will you learn  
Whatever's done in this world  
Is still gonna turn  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, down comes the night, just another forever  
How long  
How long 'till you see that we're in this together  
How long, how long  
  
If you weren't so far away  
So far from here  
I'd make your tears go away  
And make you see clear  
  
Oh, you'd see a night when two hearts would surrender  
How long  
I don't want you to be the one I remember  
How long, how long  
  
Though time goes by in the blink of an eye  
It's passed over you  
There's no time to hide, won't you stand by my side  
I'm asking you, oh  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You say you need someone to love  
But when will you learn  
  
You say you need someone to love

We agreed that it was over  
Now the lines have all been drawn  
The vows we made began to fade  
But now they're gone  
Put your pictures in a shoebox  
And my gold ring in a drawer  
I'm not supposed to love you anymore  
  
Now Sherri says she jealous  
Of this freedom that I've found  
If she were me she would be  
Out on the town  
And she says she can't imagine  
What on earth I'm waiting for  
I'm not supposed to love you anymore  
  
Oh I shouldn't care or wonder where and how you are  
But I can't hide this hurt inside my broken heart  
I'm fighting back emotions that I've never fought before  
Cause I'm not supposed to love you anymore  
  
Now I'm writing you this letter  
And it's killing me tonight  
That I agreed when you believed  
It wasn't right  
And I couldn't sleep up on the bed  
So I'm down here on the floor  
Where I'm not supposed to love you anymore  
  
Oh I shouldn't care or wonder where and how you are  
But I can't hide this hurt inside my broken heart  
I'm fighting back emotions that I've never fought before  
Cause I'm not supposed to love you anymore  
  
I'm fighting back emotions that I've never fought before  
Cause I'm not supposed to love you anymore

I know the damage that he's done  
And I know the damage that he'll do  
I know when you knock on my door  
I'll always open it to you.  
  
There is a time, there is a place  
But it's not here and now's not safe  
So don't take more than I can give  
And leave my heart out of this.  
  
CHORUS:  
You leave my heart out of this  
You're too much to resist  
I don't have the strength to pull away  
No is getting hard for me to say  
I'd love to be the way your heartache ends  
But till it does we can't be more than friends  
I'm only trying to do what's best  
It's gonna hurt you more unless  
You leave my heart out of this.  
  
I know confused is how you feel  
Afraid to make it on your own  
I know the way your hurt to heal  
And I know the empty of alone  
So take my shoulder take my hand  
Take what you need I'll understand  
Just don't take more than I can give  
And leave my heart out of this.  
  
repeat CHORUS

Here you are on the back of my mind again  
Don't guess it's gonna get any better  
Is your memory ever gonna end  
Or does it go on forever  
  
I was the one when you left town  
Said I'd get along somehow  
Didn't take long to find out  
That I was wrong  
  
Look at me now  
Nothin' but a whole lot of time on my hands  
Look at me now  
Thought I wouldn't need you  
Now I understand  
You said I was never gonna learn  
Look at me now  
  
I was so busy looking out for myself  
I know I must have took you for granted  
Didn't want to make room for someone else  
Didn't know love when I had it  
You were the one who set me free  
But you can lay the blame on me  
Come my way and you'll see  
I have changed  
  
Calling your name in the quiet of the night  
Seeing your face every time I close my eyes  
It's always the same  
I keep hoping that you might  
  
Look at me now  
Standing here holding my heart in my hands  
Look at me now  
Wishing I'd told you we could still start again  
What I'd give if you'd turn  
And look at me now  
  
Here you are on the back of my mind again

Love breathes when your out of breath  
Love sits by the bedside when you're near to death  
Love still fells you when the feeling's gone  
Love lives on and on  
  
Whoa, whoa, whoa  
Hey, hey, hey, hey  
Love is the right place  
Took me awhile, took me awhile to get it straight  
Now I want to stay  
And everyday of my life I realize love is the right place  
Love is the right place  
  
Love it moves in mysterious ways  
Like the mist on the river at the break of day  
So pull open your shutters, sing a morning song  
Love moves on and on  
  
Whoa, whoa, whoa  
Hey, hey, hey, hey  
Love is the right place  
Took me awhile, took me awhile to get it straight  
Now I want to stay  
And everyday of my life I realize love is the right place  
Love is the right place  
  
Hey, hey  
  
Where you are, near or far  
Sun and moon, moon and stars  
I know, I know  
  
Whoa, whoa, whoa  
Hey, hey, hey, hey  
Love is the right place  
Took me awhile, took me awhile to get it straight  
Now I want to stay  
And everyday of my life I realize love is the right place  
Love is the right place  
  
Love is the right place  
Love is the right place  
Love is the right place  
  
Hey yeah

You don't have to try so hard  
What's with the attitude  
All I want is who you are  
All you gotta do is  
  
Love me like you mean it  
Every day I really want to know  
That's you're willing to lay your heart on the line  
Talking is fine but feeling is believing  
Love me like you mean it  
  
You can try the latest style  
But that won't turn my head  
If you want to drive me wild  
And keep me interested  
They'll try to tell you  
That the secret to the mind of a man  
Is to be some kind of fantasy  
But what I'm needing  
You ain't ever gonna find in a magazine  
It's in between you and me

There's not a star left in the sky tonight  
That hasn't been wished on  
And I've been wishin' I could find me a wishin' well  
I'd throw in every penny I own  
  
I've got moonlight and a warm June night  
All that's missing here is you  
Me and the moon have never been so blue  
If I may I wish I might find you lying beside me  
  
In a way  
I can see your eyes in the stars  
But it's not the same  
I want to see the stars in your eyes tonight  
  
To be the stars in your eyes tonight  
Just me and the stars in your eyes tonight  
But it's me and the moon  
It seems if you believe in a dream enough  
  
It has to come true  
And mine would turn back time til the world unwinds  
If I could be holding you  
So if a star falls from the sky tonight  
  
You'll know what I tried to do  
Me and the moon have never been so blue  
If I may I wish I might find you lying beside me  
In a way  
  
I can see your eyes in the stars  
But it's not the same  
I want to see the stars in your eyes tonight  
To be stars in your eyes tonight  
  
Just me and the stars in your eyes tonight  
Not me and the moon  
And If I may I wish I might find you lying beside me  
In a way  
  
I can see your eyes in the stars  
But it's not the same  
I want to see the stars in your eyes tonight  
To be the stars in your eyes tonight  
  
Just me and the stars in your eyes tonight  
But it's me and the moon  
And me and the moon have never been so blue

She cries just a little when she sees him walk away  
After all, she can't see it any other way  
And it's hard when you're feelin' like there's nothin' left to lose  
No she can't help it, she sees no excuse  
There's no good in her goodbye  
There's no tears she hasn't cried  
But it's not enough  
She needs nothin' less than love  
Don't say the sacrifice is small  
And no one ever has it all  
When all she wants  
Is nothin' less than love  
You can't stand in the middle and see it either way  
That's just how it is, no one ever wants the blame  
So she'll pick up the pieces and pretend she just can't see  
Cause all she's looking for is some room to breathe  
She knows better than to wait  
Just keep waiting until it's too late  
There's no good in her goodbye  
When all she wants  
Is nothin' less than love  
Don't say the sacrifice is small  
And no one ever has it all  
When all she wants  
Is nothin' less than love

Long, long ago  
In a world dark and cold  
A night so still, winter's chill  
One bright star was shining  
On a bed made of hay  
In a manger He lay  
Shepherds came, they knew His name  
King of kings, a brand new day  
They saw the light in the darkness  
It shines on love and tenderness  
Brings out the hope that's in all of us  
May it shine its light on you this Christmas Night  
On this Christmas Day  
May that star light your way  
This Christmas Eve, I still believe  
That same star still shines on me  
I saw the light in the darkness  
It shines on love and tenderness  
Brings out the hope that's in all of us  
May it shine its light on you this Christmas Night  
I saw the light in the darkness  
It shines on love and tenderness  
Brings out the hope that's in all of us  
May it shine its light on you this Christmas Night  
Ooh, may it shine its light on you this Christmas Night  

She's standing at the front door  
With a suitcase in her hand  
I'm staring down the hallway  
Frozen where I stand  
She says she doesn't love me anymore  
Oh Lord what can I do?  
It's gonna take a miracle to make us stay  
That's why I'm asking you  
  
So please don't you have a miracle just laying around  
One small miracle nobody needs  
Send it on down  
I'll never make it through this night  
Thinking she's with someone else  
Please don't you have just one small miracle left  
  
I know I haven't been a saint  
And asking you for anything takes nerve  
'Cause you've already blessed me with so much more in life than I deserve  
But if you can make a blind man see  
And change the water into wine  
Then surely you can keep her from tearing out this ol' heart of mine  
  
Please don't you have just one small miracle left

You got the power, you got the mind  
You got the skills, Baby, I ain't lyin'  
They way you walk, the way you flirt  
Your baby talk could get a grown man hurt  
I might be wastin' my time  
But I know I'm losing my mind  
  
Shari Ann  
You don't have to try to make me blue  
"Cause you know you can, it comes so natural to you  
Shari Ann you don't have to play so hard to get  
I'm just a man, but honey I'm the match you never met  
  
Do you understand what I'm goin' through  
I'm in love with you  
I'll be your rock, I'll be your rock 'n' roll  
I'll be the serenade for your soul  
You're non-stop strong, comin' on  
You can carry me  
Shari Ann

I'm waiting on the green light to make you mine  
But your heart's just taking its own sweet time  
You want to be sure if you'll sink or swim  
Well grab ahold of me and just jump on in  
You're playing it safe  
But baby I'll wait  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, whenever you're ready  
I could be yours in a second or so  
Oh, baby come and get me  
My heart's sittin' on go  
Ooh, it's off to the races  
All you've gotta do is let me know  
Oh, I'm ready and waiting  
My heart's sittin' on go  
  
You oughta give in now instead of resisting  
'Cause I'm not above a little arm twisting  
I'm bettin' it's only a matter of time  
Before you and me are standing at the finish line  
You're having your doubts  
But you'll come around  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You're playing it safe  
But baby I'll wait  
  
[Chorus]  
  
My heart's sittin' on go  
My heart's sittin' on go

Straight out of some story  
You walk in in all your glory  
I thought you were perfect for me.  
I was out of my mind.  
  
Looked like I was winning,  
It was the best love I'd ever been in.  
Just when we were beginning, The End, you left me behind.  
And I was looking forward to a happy ending,  
So much for pretending.  
  
I should have known better,  
Than to think of happy-ever-after,  
You and me together,  
I was out of my league.  
  
I kept my heart hidden,  
Now I'm wishin' that I didn't.  
Oh, who am I kidding?  
You weren't even intrigued.  
And I was looking forward to a happy ending,  
So much for pretending.  
  
It could've been beautiful,  
If I'd only met ya,  
If I'd only let you know  
What you meant to me.  
And if I could, I would,  
Give you a demonstration  
Of how my imagination  
Thought it ought to be.  
So much for pretending.  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh yeah yeah  
  
Pretending, pretending, pretending  
So much for pretending.

Alone again tonight  
Without someone to love  
The stars are shining bright  
So one more wish goes up  
Oh I wish I may, and I wish with all my might  
For the love I'm dreaming of  
And missing in my life  
  
You'd think that I could find  
A true love of my own  
It happens all the time to people that I know  
Their wishes all come true  
So I've got to believe  
That there's still someone out there who  
Is meant for only me  
  
[Chorus]  
I guess I must be wishing on someone else's star  
Seems like someone else  
Keeps getting what I'm wishing for  
Why can't I be as lucky as those other people are  
I guess I must be wishing on someone else's star  
  
I sit here in the dark  
And stare up at the sky  
And I can't give my heart  
One good reason why  
Everywhere I look  
It's lovers that I see  
Seems like everyone's in love  
With everyone but me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Why can't I be as lucky as those other people are  
Oh I guess I must be wishing  
On someone else's star

Out on the porch swing  
Like some old painting  
He seems like he don't move at all  
And somewhere a bell rings  
And he's just remembering  
The last time that she ever called  
He picks up the phone and he says to the dial tone  
  
It's still life without you  
And I still hold on  
What it feels like  
You can't go by that  
It's still life still life without you  
  
The chances were given  
To get on with living  
The truth is that he never tried  
And no one ever sees him  
Most folks don't even  
Remember which one of them died  
But he still denies it he closes his eyes and  
  
It's still life without you  
And I still hold on  
What it feels like  
You can't go by that  
It's still life still life without you  
  
Oh, still life, still life without you  
  
Out on the porch swing  
Like some old painting  
It seems like he don't move at all

I can feel sorry for my friends, they must be tired  
Of all the fuss that I've been making  
But since last night I'm feeling so inspired  
It's like a dream and I'm not waking  
If they could hear you whisper they'd agree  
It's more than a love song, it's a symphony  
  
It was that good, it was that right  
That chance you get once in your life  
The answer to the prayer my heart's been praying  
It was that real, it was that strong  
That feeling just can't be wrong  
I'd go on forever if I could  
It was that good  
  
Suddenly I'm saying things I've never heard  
My soul is doing all the talking  
If it was ordinary you wouldn't hear a word  
I'd keep it to myself and just keep walking  
  
But it's no secret what you've done to me  
There's no doubt in my mind girl, I believe  
The more I think about it  
Don't know how I lived without it  
It's given new life to me, to know you agree

I used to sing to her  
It used to make her smile  
She knew all the words  
For a while  
I sang love me tender  
Always and forever  
Hold me baby all night long  
I could go on and on  
But that's another song  
  
We used to go for walks  
On a country road like this  
It's funny all the small  
Things you miss  
  
Like puttin' pennies on a train track  
The way you brushed your hair back  
The sun on your face  
I wish I were there today  
But that's another place  
  
Oh, the way I used to hold her  
The things I should've told her  
If I could make the clock unwind  
Back to when she was mine  
But that's another time  
  
Oh, the way I used to hold her  
The things I should've told her  
If I could make the clock unwind  
Back to when she was mine  
But that's another time  
  
I could go on and on and on  
But that's another song

I know what you've been waiting for  
A little love and happiness  
The truth in front of you, so hard to ignore  
All you need is tenderness  
So drop the Norma Jean  
I ain't no James Dean  
Just let it flow, no need to fake it, babe  
We can make it babe, if we just let it go  
It's only natural, baby  
You and me dancing close  
This could be love  
You never know  
Just take my hand now, baby  
We can move it out on the floor  
This could be the love that you've waited for  
Don't sit around and dream  
Let's do the natural thing  
You're thinking, maybe I'm just breaking the rules  
By coming on a little strong  
But I got information you can use  
Do lighten up and play along  
Let's have a wing ding, a little spring thing  
Don't tell me no  
I don't want no wedding ring, ain't rushing anything  
Just let the good times roll  
It's only natural, baby  
You and me dancing close  
This could be love  
You never know  
Just take my hand now, baby  
We can move it out on the floor  
This could be the love that you've waited for  
Don't sit around and dream  
Let's do the natural thing  
So drop the Norma Jean  
I ain't no James Dean  
Just let it flow, no need to fake it, babe  
We can make it babe, if we just let it go  
It's only natural, baby  
You and me dancing close  
This could be love  
You never know  
Just take my hand now, baby  
We can move it out on the floor  
This could be the love that you've waited for  
Don't sit around and dream  
Let's do the natural thing  

You're beautiful eyes,  
Sparkle like two diamonds on fire  
Why am I still surprised  
At the way they make me feel  
Thought I could get no higher  
If you showed me a whole new deal  
  
It's not the way you look  
Even though heaven knows  
You're a sight to see  
It's not the way you look,  
It's the way you look at me  
It's not the way you look,  
It's the way you look at me  
  
Most any old time,  
Could be a special occasion  
Just call me  
And I'm already halfway there  
You choose the destination,  
I'll go with you anywhere  
  
It's not the way you look  
Even though heaven knows  
You're a sight to see  
It's not the way you look,  
It's the way you look at me  
It's not the way you look,  
It's the way you look at me  
  
Like I'm all you ever wanted me to be  
Its not the way you look  
Even though heaven knows  
You're a sight to see  
It's not the way you look,  
It's the way you look at me  
It's not the way you look,  
It's the way you look at me

This town doesn't understand  
Two people makin' dreams and plans  
They say we're much too young  
In this town  
  
This town's full of narrow minds  
Can't see beyond the city limit signs  
They close the bedroom blinds  
In this town  
  
I've done some thinkin'  
And I realize  
There's more than Dairy Queens and Friday Nights  
While we're still young we've gotta get away  
Together we can make our break  
  
From this town  
Word'll get around  
Two renegades escaped  
No they couldn't keep us down  
And this town  
Will be a dime store memory  
Baby I just know it  
There's a better place to be  
Than this town  
Oh this town  
  
Now this town's got a factory  
Not much future here for you and me  
It's as far as they can see  
In this town  
  
I've heard the blowin' at my door  
Voices tellin' me there's so much more  
It's easy to get bored  
In this town  
  
I've just go to see those city lights  
It's time we spread our wings and learn to fly  
They'll never catch us if we disappear  
Oh the interstate is much too near  
  
To this town  
Word'll get around  
Two renegades escaped  
No they couldn't keep us down  
And this town  
Will be a dime store memory  
Baby I just know it  
There's a better place to be  
Than this town  
Oh this town  
  
Can't you just hear them talkin'  
Their righteous words  
Burnin' down the wire  
What do we care what they think now  
Thinkin's not allowed  
In this town  
  
From this town  
Word'll get around  
Two renegades escaped  
No they couldn't keep us down  
And this town  
Will be a dime store memory  
Baby I just know it  
There's a better place to be  
Than this town  
Oh this town  
  
This town  
This town  
This town

In a world of illusion  
Filled with wrong turns  
Where so many bridges  
Seem destined to burn  
The odds are so great  
The chances so slim  
To find the right her  
For just the right him  
  
We're two in a million, exceptions to the rule  
I followed my heart and love led me to you  
It's a gamble at best, so easy to lose  
But the first time we kissed we both knew  
We're two in a million  
Two who found one love that's true  
  
What some call love  
Can be lost overnight  
And they find there's a tunnel  
At the end of the light  
But here in your arms  
The only surprise  
Is the way love keeps growing  
As time passes by

Today at work  
I overheard a name  
I knew it wasn't yours  
But it touched me just the same  
It felt so good to have you in my mind  
I guess I'm the sentimental kind  
  
[Chorus:]  
oh, I wonder who you became  
Did you change the world  
Or play the game  
We came so close to love back then  
We could have been  
  
You were so brave  
When I was sky  
I made you laugh  
When something made you cry  
And I don't think we ever said good-bye  
Now I'll always wonder why  
  
(repeat chorus)  
[Bridge:]  
A time or two  
I thought about calling  
But something always gets in the way  
Maybe I'm afraid you'd really answer  
What would I say to you?  
  
(repeat chorus)  
We could have been

Unbelievable describes your smile so sweet  
Inconceivable that you're a part of me  
The innocent look in your eyes  
Love without compromise for me  
It's a mystery  
  
What did I do to deserve you?  
Only God's hands could have made you  
And brought this dream to life  
Always swore that I, I would never fall  
I guess miracles happen after all  
And what did I ever do to deserve you?  
  
Unconventional describes my love for you  
Unconditional 'cause there's nothing I won't do  
I pray as this feeling grows  
That you'll always touch the heart and so love me  
It's a mystery  
  
What did I do to deserve you?  
Only God's hands could have made you  
And brought this dream to life  
Always swore that I, I would never fall  
I guess miracles happen after all  
And what did I ever do to deserve you?  
  
I've waited all my life  
To hold such a treasure  
What is this feeling worth?  
There's no measure  
What did I do?  
  
You brought this dream to life  
  
Always swore that I, I would never fall  
I guess miracles happen after all  
And what did I ever do to deserve you?  
  
To deserve you?  
To deserve you?

Have you ever had one of those days  
When you really need a friend  
The day drags on and on  
And you think there's no end  
  
Then you know how I feel  
Have you ever had one of those nights  
When you just lie awake  
Starin' at the ceiling  
  
Untile the dawn breaks  
Then you know how I feel  
If you've heard goodbye  
And something inside just won't heal  
  
If a memory won't set you free  
And you know that it never will  
Then you know how I feel  
If you've heard goodbye  
  
And something inside just won't heal  
If a memory won't set you free  
And you know that it never will  
  
Then you know how I feel  
Then you know how I feel

Turn out the lights and close the door  
Put your head on the pillow  
Let me keep you warm  
I want to run my hands across your face  
Lyin' beside you is still the perfect place  
We're still going strong  
So glad that you came along  
  
Babe in every way  
You're still beautiful to me  
I just have to say  
You're still beautiful to me  
  
Lay back baby and close your eyes  
Let me do everything your heart desires  
When I think of the years making love to you  
There still ain't nothing that I'd rather do  
There's something I can't deny  
You sure know how to move this guy  
  
Babe in every way  
You're still beautiful to me  
I just have to say  
You're still beautiful to me  
  
(And it still feels good)  
It still feels good  
It still runs deep  
When you get close, babe  
I still get weak  
"Cause in these arms is where you belong  
We're still going strong  
So glad that you came along  
Hey babe, you're still number one  
Baby can't you see  
  
You're still beautiful to me  
You'll always be so beautiful to me
