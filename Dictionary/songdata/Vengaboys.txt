I wish I could turn back time  
I wish I'd never have to see that look in your eyes  
You really broke this heart of mine  
Now it's time to realize it's forever goodbye  
  
So here I am  
All alone  
Don't understand where did we go wrong  
I can't stop crying  
Can't take the pain  
Knowing you won't ever be back again  
  
And it cuts like a knife  
I'm going insane  
Wishing you would show me love  
Once again  
I'm losing my mind  
But I have to carry on  
We were meant to be together  
Forever as one  
  
So this is where the story ends  
Gonna take some to dry the tears in my eyes  
You told me we could still be friends  
Now I know your promises were nothing but lies  
  
So here I am  
All alone  
Don't understand where did we go wrong  
I can't stop crying  
Can't take the pain  
Knowing you won't ever be back again  
  
And it cuts like a knife  
I'm going insane  
Wishing you would show me love  
Once again  
I'm losing my mind  
But I have to carry on  
We were meant to be together  
Forever as one

Every Friday  
My head's spinning round and round  
Been working all week now baby  
Yes, it's my day  
I take a trip downtown  
To my favourite club now, baby  
That's when I see you  
With loving arms to fall into  
But I'm not lookin' for full-time love  
There's still so much I wanna do  
I only kiss, kiss, kiss when the sun don't shine  
Oh-woah, oh-woah  
You wanna kiss, kiss, kiss then tonight is fine  
Oh-woah, oh-woah  
Can live without it  
I don't want a full-time love  
'cause it's not on my mind now, baby  
You know my freedom  
Is what I'm thinking of  
And I ain't got the time now, baby  
Straight out of the blue  
You came and asked me to  
Be your date in the daytime babe  
But I am sorry, no can do  
I only kiss, kiss, kiss when the sun don't shine  
Oh-woah, oh-woah  
You wanna kiss, kiss, kiss then tonight is fine  
Oh-woah, oh-woah

There's a boy in my mind and he knows I'm thinkin' of him  
All my way to the day and the night the stars shine above me.  
He's been gone for some time but I know I truly love him.  
And I'm singing a song, hoping he'll be back when he hears it.  
  
[Chorus]  
My heart goes shalala lala, shalala in the morning.  
Oh oh oh shalala lala, shalala in the sunshine.  
Shalala lala, shalala lala in the evening.  
Shalala lala shalala lala just for you.  
  
If your love's gone away just like mine you feel like crying.  
Sing along maybe once maybe twice, let's try it together.  
Some sweet day no one knows he'll return and you'll be happy.  
Shout it sweet in a song, listen to your heart it is singin'  
  
[Chorus]  
My heart goes shalala lala, shalala in the morning.  
Oh oh oh shalala lala, shalala in the sunshine.  
Shalala lala, shalala lala in the evening.  
Shalala lala shalala lala just for you.  
  
If your love's gone away just like mine you feel like crying.  
Sing along maybe once maybe twice, let's try it together.  
Some sweet day no one knows he'll return and you'll be happy.  
Shout it sweet in a song, listen to your heart it is singin'  
  
[Chorus]  
My heart goes shalala lala, shalala in the morning.  
Oh oh oh shalala lala, shalala in the sunshine.  
Shalala lala, shalala lala in the evening.  
Shalala lala shalala lala just for you.

Big boy showing of all around the city  
Still the same for such a  
Suite  
Thinking you're so bad  
Hustlin' girls, handy phone, acting like your  
Busy baby let me tell you, you're the worst I ever had

Highbrow attitude, really don't impress me  
I know where you're coming from  
See right through your game  
Luxury overdose won't make you possess me  
Baby let me tell you, in the end it's all the same  
Don't think I'm crying and trying to get  
You out of my heart  
No need denying that you have been lying  
Right from the start  
I thought this love would take us to the  
Heights of sensuality  
But now I know that you're not even half  
The man you said you'd be  
  
Don't think I'm crying and trying to get  
You out of my heart  
No need denying that you have been lying  
Right from the start  
I thought this love would take us to the  
Heights of sensuality  
But now I know that you're not even half  
The man you said you'd be  
  
Superfly superfly  
Superfly slick dick  
Superfly superfly  
Superfly slick dick  
  
Superfly superfly  
Superfly slick dick

Just wanna dance because of  
YouYou are moving me so right

8 o'clock get up get outta bed  
I feel like a truck ran over my head  
Another day of stress and sorrow  
Skip breakfast, 'cause I gotta go  
Ain't got no time to take it slow  
And I will do my hair tomorrow  
  
I can't take it no more  
Oh no no no  
Is this what I'm living for?  
  
But my Uncle John from Jamaica  
Keeps on calling every day  
Just buy a ticket and take a  
Summer Holi-Holiday  
  
6 o'clock my job is still not done  
The life I'm living ain't no fun  
Too many days of stress and sorrow  
My boss just won't give me a break  
And this is more than I can take  
  
Think I will quit this job tomorrow  
  
But my Uncle John from Jamaica  
Keeps on calling every day  
Just buy a ticket and take a  
Summer Holi-Holiday  
  
But my Uncle John from Jamaica  
Keeps on calling every day  
Just buy a ticket and take a  
Summer Holi-Holiday
