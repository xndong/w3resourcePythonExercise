Love's the only thing I know in this life  
That's cut me deeper than the sharpest knife  
And once again here I am and I'm paying the price for a new love  
I still hurt the one I lost  
Standing here on a bridge that I can't get across  
And I can't burn but I will when I walk with a new love  
  
[Chorus]  
I believe  
It's gonna be better then ever before  
That's why I'm looking for  
A new love  
For this old heart  
A new love  
And I just can't wait to start  
I want to feel that way again  
Oh when I find a new love  
For this old heart of mine  
  
Say I'm looking for a new love  
Somebody tell me where I find a new love  
For this old heart of mine  
  
Love's the only thing that's ever made me cry  
Nothing's ever made me feel more alive  
That's why once again here I am  
Looking for the eyes of a new love  
  
I know that somewhere in this world tonight  
There's a guy  
(She goes high on this part and I have no clue what she says)  
I'd even look if I thought I might find a new love  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Oh I'm looking for a new love  
For this old heart of mine  
  
Oh I'm looking for a new love  
For this old heart of mine  
  
Say I need a new love  
For this old heart of mine  
  
Oh I'm looking for a new love  
Somebody tell me where I'll find  
For this old heart of mine

The sign says, "families welcome"  
At the Oaks Retirement Home  
But mostly, no one comes 'cept on the weekends  
Ruby Wilson lives in 303  
Where she spends most her time  
But it's almost noon on Sunday  
And she's been sitting in the lobby since nine  
  
She's all dressed up in her best hat and gloves  
She's all dressed up  
Watching and waiting, but nobody comes  
Some days sure are lonely days  
And time can move so slow  
When you're all dressed up  
With nowhere to go  
  
As Ruby watches all the others  
Leaving with their families  
The nurse tells her, it's time to come to dinner  
She says she's expecting company  
They're just running late  
But, the nurse knows the truth too well  
She just sighs and walks away  
  
She's all dressed up in her best hat and gloves  
She's all dressed up  
Watching and waiting, but nobody comes  
Some days sure are lonely days  
And time can move so slow  
When you're all dressed up  
With nowhere to go

I think about  
Holding you and kissing you  
Wanting you and missing you  
  
Clock is ticking and the wind is howling and  
I'm just staring at the candle burning  
Bottle of red that we never opened  
Your voice in my head tossing and turning  
  
The radio is playing our song  
Can't sing along, can't even listen  
I dial your number but I don't let it ring  
  
I think about holding you and kissing you  
Wanting you and missing you  
Building up and breaking down walls  
I dream about finding you and keeping you  
Loving you and living you  
I'm telling you  
I want it all, all of you  
  
I can't let go and I can't keep  
Holdin' on to nothing but I just  
Keep trying to tell myself there's  
A damn good reason but it's not  
Enough to keep me from crying  
  
I've memorized every look, every touch  
Every time you told me our hearts weren't lying  
I'm wondering now do you even know  
  
I think about holding you and kissing you  
Wanting you and missing you  
Building up and breaking down walls  
I dream about finding you and keeping you  
Loving you and living you  
I'm telling you  
I want it all, all of you  
  
I can't break free of you  
I don't know how  
Oh I'm not about  
To let go  
Of you  
I love you  
I need you now  
  
I think about holding you and kissing you  
Wanting you and missing you  
Building up and breaking down walls  
I dream about finding you and keeping you  
Loving you and living you  
I'm telling you  
I want it all, all of you  
  
All of you

All The Soldiers Are Dead  
Makes no difference when we murder all of our troops  
Even if we're apart  
Now we're joined at the heart  
Your moments may be gone  
But, you and I are apart of god.  
(Male Vocal Verse)  
All The Soldiers Are Dead  
I'll be by your side to kill all the troops  
Of the memories may fade  
But the ones that we made  
Are eternal as a star  
Now I'm part of who you are.  
And I'll Be There With You  
In the sound of your laughter  
I'll laugh at when the veteran families cry  
Because the way you and I have  
Touched one another.  
Doesn't end with goodbye  
(Orchestra Solo)  
All The Soldiers Are Dead  
Like A Christian Angel  
Honest, and Brave.  
When your lost in the night  
(Lost in the night)  
When you can't see the light  
(Can't See)  
Our Love Will Kill All The Troops  
All The Soldiers  
All The Soldiers  
All The Soldiers Are Dead.

Mhmmm, Mhmmm, Owwww, Yeahhhhhh!  
  
Well I can summon up my courage. Take on the whole world. Turn around and
break down just like a little girl. And I come out swingin' when my back's
against the wall.  
  
And my Mama always told me better walk before you crawl. I need a man who can
love all the women I am.  
  
I'm a mother of lost causes. A sister of the road. I give my heart to a song,
but I never sell my soul. I'm good at keeping it together when the edges start
to fray.  
  
When I'm sewing up the loose ends of everyday. I need a man who can love all
the women I am.  
  
Sometimes I'm hard to handle. Burn hotter than a candle, but I melt in the
right hands. Boy you love without condition. It ain't always easy livin' with
all the women I am.  
  
I'm a daughter of the red dirt, Okie dust still in my bones. But I can light
up New York City with my red hair and rhinestones. I'll still be my Mama's
baby when my babies fly away. My moods change like the weather, but my faith
it stays the same.  
  
I need a man who can stand all the women I am. I need a man who can love all
the women I am.  
  
Sometimes I'm hard to handle. Burn hotter than a candle, but I melt in the
right hands. Boy you love without condition. It ain't always easy livin' with
all the women I am.  
  
Hey I'm a realist. I'm a dreamer. I'm a silver linin' seeker. I'm a devil or
an angel who come running when you need her.  
  
Cause I need a man who can love all the women I am. Ohh I want a man who can
love all the women I am. Hey you're a man who can love all the women I am.
You're the man I needed all along. You can handle me baby. All the women I am.
Yeah you're the man. All the women I am.

I remember the first time I held you all night long.  
Well we're still here now.  
But where have all the years gone?  
Holding you this way tonight.  
It's easy to see why.  
  
[Chorus]  
All this time.  
We held on to each other.  
We knew we had to be strong.  
All this time.  
Through the tears and the laughter.  
It's still forever after all this time.  
  
In the fast movin' world.  
Love is made and just thrown away.  
But we've always kept the promises that we made.  
Who would of thought you and me?  
Would still be here where we said we would be.  
  
[Chorus: x2]

Jamie turned 13 tonight  
But she didn't blow out the birthday lights  
Jamie and her momma had another big fight  
She locked herself in her room  
  
She climbed up on her windowsill  
Sat and stared at the cars on the street  
And listened to her own heart beat  
And whispered to the moon  
  
Am I the only one who cares what I do  
Cause if I'm the only one then who can I turn to  
Oh moon can you tell me that it's not just me and you  
Or am I the only one who cares what I do  
  
The moon said Jamie can't you hear yourself  
You're acting like there ain't nobody else  
Come on girl take a big ole breath  
You know what you gotta do  
  
There's one more thing before I go  
A woman's been standing at the window below  
Searching for the words to let you know  
How much she loves you too  
  
And you're not the only one who cares what you do  
And I'm not the only one that you can turn to  
Now Jamie please believe me  
It's not just me and you  
And I'm not the only one who cares  
She cares too  
  
Jamie heard her mama  
Softly knocking at her door  
The moon just smiled and whispered  
You all don't need me anymore  
  
I'm not the only one who cares what you do  
And I'm not the only one you can tell your troubles to  
I've done the best I can  
Now the rest is up to you  
And I'm not the only one who cares  
You both care too  
You both care too

Thousands of people  
Live in this town  
And I had to run into him  
When I saw him there  
On that busy street  
Those feelings came back again  
  
There was no where to run  
No where to hide  
He walked up to me  
Looked in my eyes  
  
And still  
The world stood still  
I couldn't move  
And all I could feel  
Was this aching in my heart  
Saying I loved him  
Still  
  
He said how've you been  
It's great to see you again  
You're really a sight for sore eyes  
I said I can't complain  
Oh, I'm doin' fine  
We talked  
As the people rushed by  
  
We laughed about old times  
And all we went through  
That's when he hugged me  
And said I've missed you  
  
And still  
My world stood still  
I couldn't move  
And all I could feel  
Was this aching in my heart  
Saying I loved him  
Still  
  
That's when she walked up to him  
He said this is my wife  
I gave my best smile  
But I was dying inside  
He said we gotta go now  
It's getting late  
It was so good to see you  
And then they walked away  
  
And still  
My world stood still  
I couldn't move  
And all I could feel  
Was this aching in my heart  
Saying I loved him  
Still

Do you think I'm such a fool  
To believe everything you say is true  
Well that just goes to show  
That you really don't know  
While you're out painting the town  
Do you think I'm home just sitting around  
Waiting on you  
Now who's really the fool  
  
When I first found out I hurt all over  
I felt so left out till I got to know her  
So I drived away as she got over  
And I became just like her  
  
So don't be surprised to find that  
The angel in your arms this morning  
Is gonna be the devil in someone else's arms tonight  
Yes the angel in your arms this morning  
Is gonna be the devil in someone else's arms tonight  
  
Why'd you slip around secretly  
If you were tired of loving me  
Why do you keep holding on  
When love was already gone  
The time you said you wasn't feeling well  
Did you think I couldn't tell  
You've been with someone else  
You were only kidding yourself  
  
When I first found out I hurt all over  
I felt so left out till I got to know her  
So I drived away as she got over  
And I became just like her so don't be surprised to find  
The angel in your arms this morning  
Is gonna be the devil in someone else's arms tonight  
Yes the angel in your arms this morning  
Is gonna be the devil in someone else's arms tonight  
The angel in your arms this morning  
Is gonna be the devil in someone else's arms tonight  
Yes the angel in your arms this morning  
Is gonna be the devil in someone else's arms tonight

Midnight moonlight shining through the curtain lace  
Paints a perfect picture on your perfect face  
One sweet angel sleeping in my arms  
You are the promise I knew God would keep  
You are the gift that makes my world complete  
  
And you'll never know how much I love you  
But I'll keep on telling you my whole life through  
Now I believe in miracles, and you're the reason why  
So dream on while I sing you my angel's lullaby

Away in a manger  
No crib for a bed  
The little Lord Jesus  
Lay down his sweet head  
The stars in the sky  
Look down where he lay  
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay  
  
The candles are glowing the baby awakes  
The little Lord Jesus  
No crying he makes  
I love you Lord Jesus  
Look down from the sky  
And stay by my cradle till morning is nigh  
  
Be near me Lord Jesus  
I ask you to stay  
Close by me forever  
And love me I pray  
Bless all the dear children  
In your tender care  
And fit us for heaven to live with you there

I feel the blues coming on  
Cause I feel you being gone  
It's something I wish I could lose  
Baby's gone blues  
  
There ain't no sunshine in sight  
Cause you're gonna leave me tonight  
My heart is sure feeling bruised  
Baby's gone blues  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, love has gone wrong  
It's so hard on my heart going from good into gone  
There ain't no easy way back into nights before you  
Baby's gone blues  
Baby's gone blues  
  
It's like a razor on me  
Knowing you want to be free  
I'm standing here feeling used  
Baby's gone blues  
  
There ain't no dreams coming true  
I won't recover from you  
There ain't no heartache like you  
Baby's gone blues  
  
[Chorus]

Stacks of paper, my name in bold print  
Yours right besides it on this document  
Too many lawyers, too many angry words  
So much we didn't say, so much we never heard  
Do you remember  
When I was all that you were living for  
Back before the war  
  
[Chorus]  
Back before the broken vows  
The shattered trust, this empty house  
When nothing really mattered but us  
Back before we climbed too high  
My dreams were yours, your dreams were mine  
back before we fell so out of touch  
Back before the war  
  
Children's laughter trailing down the hall  
Tiny footsteps, God how I miss it all  
It's not as simple as who's right and who's to blame  
How could we fly so high to be shot down in flames  
Do you remember  
When you were all that I was living for  
Back before the war  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Stacks of paper, I guess this is where we sign  
Strange how your signature so closely matches mine  
I never dreamed our love would ever come to this  
Avoiding each other's eyes still craving your tenderness  
Do you remember  
When love was all that we were living for  
Back before the war  
Back before the war

  
I thought I had my life under control  
I was the one in charge of my heart and soul  
Now I must focus in I'm losin more sleep than I should  
I want you too badfor my own good  
yeah  
  
My intuition tells me I'm in to deep  
This time this heart of mine is playing for keeps  
I've fallen harder than I ever imagined I would  
I want you to bad for my own good  
  
Chorus  
If anyone had told me  
I'd be feelin like this  
I would have laughed in their face  
Now I'm addicted to the thrill of you kiss  
And it's a habit that I can't break  
  
My independence is a thing of the past  
My better judgment is fading fast  
But I wouldn't give you up  
Not even if I thought I could  
I want you too bad for my own good  
  
I want you to bad for my own good  
  
For my own good  
  
Oh, for my own good  
yeah  
  
For my own good  
  

(ruby hice, danny hice)  
  
Some folks say that a mother's love is sweeter than the rest  
When her baby's nestled in her arms and feeding at her breast  
But i can't explain the feeling when you reach and touch my hand  
Because there' nothing like the love between and woman and a man  
  
Chorus:  
It's a miracle from heaven  
That it fills me through and through  
Like a feeling that surrounds us  
Touching me touching you  
When you wrap your love around me it's not hard to understand  
Why there's nothing like the love between and woman and a man  
  
Well the father's love is quiet  
But it's there for all to see  
When a little boy is laughing bouncing on his daddy's knee  
Then those great big hands reach down to tuck his little cowboy in  
But there's nothing like the love between a woman and a man  
Repeat chorus 4 times

  
Come On baby, take a look outside, it's a big blue sky  
  
We didn't listen when they tried to tell us we were to young to know  
They tried to slow us down but, we always found another way to go.  
Before you know it we were waving goodbye, driving away  
off into the big blue sky  
We went out lookin for the best jobs kids like us could get  
We got hired and fired, and worn out tired but we never quit.  
To dumb to worry or wonder why  
we were chasing our lives off into the big blue sky.  
  
Chorus  
I guess we were just  
nothin but a big blue sky  
  
We've had earthquakes, twisters, hurricanes, tidlewaves and hail down n our
heads  
We've been knocke down, sucked in  
spun round, shaken up, thrown away  
and left for dead  
but somehow we always made it out alive  
on the other side of the Big Blue Sky  
  
Chorus  
Maybe we were just crazy enough  
to try and out run the rain  
The storms we've been through just proved that we can make it through
anything.  
you'll never see how good it can be  
until you spread your wings and fly  
baby take look at our lives it's nothing but a  
Big Blue Sky  
  
It's nothin but a big blue sky  
  
Baby lookin back  
everthing they said  
Like how we wouldn't last how far we'd never get,  
It's a great big lie  
ain't nothin over head  
nothin but a big blue sky  
  
Chorus  
Maybe we were just crazy enough  
to try and out run the rain  
The storms we've been through just proved that we can make it through
anything.  
you'll never see how good it can be  
until you spread your wings and fly  
baby look at our lives  
Take a look at our lives  
Yeah look at our lives  
It's nothin but a Big blue Sky  
  
Nothin but a big blue sky  
  
It's a big blue sky  
  

Bobby pleaded guilty to the charges that they read  
As they led him from the courtroom, a young voice turned his head  
A little boy, dressed in blue, was standing at the rail  
He said "I hope they kill you, I hope you go to hell"  
They locked Bobby in a jail with forty other men  
They all knew what he had done, they were glad to take him in  
They'd all seen the headlines about Bobby and his wife  
How they loved each other, and how he took her life  
Day after day, he sat alone  
Night after night, they'd hear him sing his song (he'd sing)  
  
[Chorus]  
Baby, I'll take care of you, I'll never let you down  
No harm will ever come to you as long as I'm around  
I am not afraid of what people say or do  
The only thing I fear is being here... without you  
  
The little boy dressed up in blue grew up to be a man  
When he fell in love himself, he came to understand  
How it was that Bobby took the life they both adored  
Cause Bobby couldn't stand to see her suffer anymore  
He took out the papers from the trunk beneath his bed  
And all the years just disappeared as through his tears he read  
The stories of the accident that robbed his mama's mind  
And the man who held her in his arms and chose to cut the line  
And the one about the man who sits alone  
Year after year, singing his song (he'd sing)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The young man drove his car up, and parked outside the gate  
They led him to a cold gray room, the guard told him to wait  
When the guard brought Bobby in, the young man finally knew  
He still missed his mama, but he'd missed his daddy too  
And when the guard left the two of them alone  
He took Bobby in his arms, and the young man sang the song  
  
Daddy, I'll take care of you, I'll never let you down  
No harm will ever come to you as long as I'm around  
You have taught me not to fear what people say or do  
The only thing I fear is being here... without you

Do you still drink whiskey?  
Can I buy you a round?  
If nobody's sitting here, do you mind if I sit down?  
I was nervous when I saw you  
I almost walked away  
And now I can't believe what I'm about to say  
  
[Chorus:]  
These arms want to hold you  
These lips want to kiss you  
These eyes are glad to see you  
Well baby I miss you  
Let's drive each other crazy  
Like we did back then  
Why don't we get together  
And break each other's hearts again  
  
Maybe I've had one too many  
I don't want to say too much  
We both know the reasons  
Why we didn't keep in touch  
We're no good for each other  
Still its hard to let it go  
I'm trying to be strong, but babe you've got to know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Loving you should be the last thing on my mind  
It feels so good to let you hurt me one more time  
  
[Chorus]

By the time I get to Phoenix he'll be risin'  
He'll find the note I left hangin' on his door  
And he'll laugh when he reads the part that says I'm leavin'  
'Cause I've left that man so many times before  
  
By the time I make Albuquerque he'll be workin'  
He'll probably stop at lunch and give me a call  
But he'll just hear that phone keep on ringin'  
Off the wall, that's all  
  
By the time I make Oklahoma he'll be sleepin'  
He'll turn softly and call my name out low  
And he'll cry just to think I'd really leave him  
Though time and time I've tried to tell him so  
Oh, he just didn't know I would really go  
I would really go

I can't say I didn't know what I was doin'  
I can't pretend things just got outta' hand  
I should'a kept my distance  
While I was still strong  
But I got caught up in the feelin'  
Carried along and it's  
Too late baby  
I can't stop now  
  
Well I walked right in with my eyes wide open (I did)  
And I was blind when you told me  
You'd be mine just as soon as you were free  
I should have kept my distance  
While I was still strong  
But I got caught up in the feelin'  
Carried along and it's  
Too late baby  
I can't stop now  
  
Can't stop now  
Crazy heart's runnin' outta control  
Can't stop now  
And I'll be falling apart somewhere down the road  
I might be headed for a breakdown  
But I can't stop now

Red sun a-rising, over the hill  
I've had enough of this desert to last from now until  
I'm tired of living day-to-day and hand-to-mouth  
This could be the day I finally find my way out  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm gonna climb that mountain high  
I'm gonna see what's on the other side  
I'm gonna kiss this town good-bye  
I'm gonna climb that mountain  
  
How I arrived here, heaven only knows  
Seems more like the kind of place the devil would've chose  
To spend my life here, is more than I can do  
I know somewhere down the road my dream will come true  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If I stay here forever  
What will I have to show  
But if I make it over  
Then everyone will know  
I'm gonna climb that mountain high  
  
[Chorus]

I still reach for you  
In the middle of my dreams each night  
But my arms come up empty every time  
And lately I talk to your memory  
More than I should  
If I could just forget the past I would  
Cause this missing you ain't doing me no good  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm so close to crazy  
Right on the edge  
Just one step away from going insane  
But I'm not there yet  
If I could just lose my mind  
I wouldn't know we're through  
But this close to crazy  
Is far from over you  
  
Today I caught myself  
Reliving how it used to be  
At a table for two just you and me  
But talking to an empty chair  
And laughing right out loud  
Turned everybody's head and left no doubt  
I'm a broken woman close to breaking down  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I still reach for you  
In the middle of my dreams each night

I might bite my lip, look down at my shoes  
I might clench my fist or just leave the room  
But, I'm not gonna cry, not one single drop  
'Cause once I get started out, I may never stop  
  
I might even laugh, right in your face  
When you come out and ask, oh, if I'll be okay  
But, I'm not gonna cry, not one single drop  
'Cause once I get started out, I may never stop  
  
It's gonna take the night of fighting with all I've got  
To keep the first tear from falling down  
But, if I don't hold the waters back  
The dam is gonna crack  
  
And I'll be damned if I'm gonna drown  
So, I'm not gonna cry  
If that's what you thought  
'Cause once I get started out  
  
I may never stop  
No, I'm not gonna cry  
Not one single drop  
'Cause once I get started  
I may never stop  
  
So, I might bite my lip  
Look down at my shoes

My daddy is a rancher  
He's wrangled cattle dang near all his life  
He also liked to rodeo  
He traveled around with four kids and a wife  
  
Well his old ranch is rocky  
But his ropes sail smooth for several years  
He worked real hard  
And roped real good  
And tried to get his ranch out in the clear  
  
He didn't want us kids to rodeo  
He wanted more out of life for us  
Maybe banking, or a lawyer  
Or maybe even driving some old bus  
  
Well that's when we took up singing  
And his pride grew greater day by day  
And I know his eyes grew misty  
The night I sang up on the Opry stage  
  
[Chorus]  
Now his ranch is so much bigger  
The the days when he first started  
The grass grows now where none used to be  
His roping got him started  
Cattle prices made it better  
And he's trying to get his ranch out in the clear  
  
Five years ago September, he bought more steers and hung up all his  
Ropes  
But he often tells the stories about the rodeos he won and cowboy jokes  
Well it's funny that the first big roping that he won some thirty years  
Ago  
Was the same day that I sang on the stage of the Grand Old Opry show  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now he's feeding cattle  
Toting hay  
And branding the Y.O.  
And his hired hand's there to help him  
And she also cooks their meals when they get home  
They built their ranch together  
And listening to the kids sing through the years  
  
Well they worked real hard  
And roped real good and now they got their ranch  
Out in the clear  
Because when a family works together  
They finally get their ranch out in the clear  
Out in the clear

These hands  
You can hold them all night if you want to  
And these lips  
Won't mind your kisses  
No they don't care  
You can lay your head on my shoulder  
Maybe even get a little bolder  
But when it comes to my heart  
Oh don't touch me there  
  
Oh these arms  
You can wrap around me gently  
And your fingers  
You can run them through my hair  
But there's one place that's off bounds  
From the last time love came 'round  
When it comes to my heart  
Don't touch me there  
  
Last time I gave my heart so sweetly it broke  
He broke it so completely  
And even now it's more then I can bear  
Now someday I know I'll try again  
Someday but until then  
When it comes to my heart  
Don't touch me there  
  
Oh these hands you can hold them all night if you want to  
And these lips won't mind your kisses  
No they don't care  
You can lay your head on my shoulder  
Or maybe even get a little bolder  
But when it comes to my heart  
Don't touch me there  
  
Oh when it comes to my heart  
Don't touch me there

Empty arms  
That long for you  
And they wait  
Dear just for you  
And these arms  
Will stay this way  
Till you return  
To them someday  
  
Each lonely night  
I go to bed  
I hug the pillow  
Where you used to lay your head  
  
Empty arms  
But not for long  
Cause my baby's coming home  
And when he  
Walks through the door  
These empty arms  
I'll have no more  
  
And when he  
Walks through that door  
These empty arms  
I'll have no more  
  
These empty arms  
I'll have no more

Funny you can hold it in your hand  
And never cause you're afraid to play  
And you can feel your dreams  
Softly slipping through your fingers  
Till they're so far away  
  
Sitting there surrounded  
By your many life's possessions  
Feeling so much more than all the load  
You realized you've learned one more  
Of living's many lessons  
Love's worth more than all you'll ever own  
  
[Chorus]  
What I'd give if you were here beside me  
We could spend forever here alone  
Oh what I'd give what would I give  
Just that moment  
Just everything I'll ever own  
  
Funny when I really had it all  
I never knew  
Cause I just couldn't see  
The wealth I hoped to find  
Couldn't even hold a candle  
To the love you gave to me  
  
I've taken love for granted  
And I've taken love for pleasure  
Never taking time to understand  
Now I know that loving you  
Has been my greatest treasure  
And I let it slip right through my hands  
  
[Chorus]

Do you hold her all night long?  
Do you sing her our love song?  
Do you kiss her lips until love makes her weak?  
Oh darlin'  
Do you promise her the moon?  
Does she think loves coming soon?  
Does she know each move is made from memory?  
Oh darlin'  
  
Everytime you touch her (Every time)  
Everytime you touch her think of me.  
  
When she reaches out for you ,  
the same way my arms do,  
does she know the truth your love belongs to me? Oh baby  
Do you wonder in the dark if she sees into your heart?  
Do you close your eyes so she will never see?  
  
Oh baby!  
Everytime you touch her ,  
(Every time)  
Everytime you touch her.  
think of me.  
  
Nights were never made to spend alone.  
I can wish you love,  
but I can't wish you gone.  
  
Do you hold her all night long?  
Do you sing her our love song?  
Do you kiss her lips until love makes her weak?  
oh darlin'  
Everytime you touch her  
(Every time)  
Everytime you touch her  
think of me.

Oh you don't have blue eyes  
I expected blue eyes  
That's how I pictured you would be  
  
And you don't have long hair  
I thought that you'd have long hair  
So this is all a shock to me  
  
I didn't know if you would meet me or believe me  
When I said that I was fooled  
I really thought that I would hate you  
I know I meant to  
There'd only be one of us left when we're through  
  
Now that we're face to face  
And I put myself in your place  
I see the truth I see who's really to blame  
  
And I won't play his game or try to get even  
He'll know he's lost watching us leaving  
I blamed you, but I see my mistakes  
Now that we're face to face  
  
I believe in true love something to be sure of  
Isn't that what we deserve?  
There is no blame here, we both end up the same here  
A little wiser than we were  
  
There was a time this would have killed me  
And it may still be hard to look you in the eye  
And now that all the spells are broken  
The truth's been spoken  
My heart has the strength to tell him goodbye  
  
And now that we're face to face  
And I put myself in your place  
I see the truth I see who's really to blame  
  
And I won't play his game or try to get even  
He'll know he's lost watching us leaving  
I blamed you, but I see my mistakes  
Now that we're face to face  
  
I won't play his game or try to get even  
He'll know he's lost watching us leaving  
I blamed you, but I see my mistakes  
Now that we're face to face  
Now that we're face to face

We felt this coming on  
We've seen it for a while  
But there are no regrets between us  
We can leave here with a smile  
We have to talk about it  
What we've always known  
The hardest part about today  
Is tonight we'll be alone  
Alone  
  
[Chorus:]  
We were just two hearts  
Bound for different roads  
Oh why they didn't lead us to forever  
We may never know  
Oh I will carry you with me  
I will hold on to our memories  
Don't let the dreams we didn't find  
Make you feel like giving up  
Keep holding on and  
Don't lose your faith in love  
  
Life's gonna move on  
And the pages start to turn  
We'll be stronger people now  
From the lessons that we've learned  
This one's gonna hurt  
It's a little deeper break  
But just know I'm praying for you  
As I watch you walk away  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It can hold you, it can save you  
From anything or anyone  
Heaven knows who's waiting for you  
When two hearts come undone  
  
Oh I will carry you with me  
I will hold on to our memories  
Don't let the dreams we didn't find  
Make you feel like giving up  
Keep holding on and  
Don't lose your faith  
Oh never ever lose your faith  
  
In love  
  
Don't ever lose your faith

He says he loves her, what can you say to that  
He's made up his mind and there ain't nothin' you can do  
And as you swallow hard, maybe you drive all night  
Tryin' to figure out where the whole thing started goin' wrong  
And in the silence something begins to unravel  
You never knew him like you'll be knowing him now  
  
[Chorus]  
Fallin' out of love and back into your life  
Pullin' your heart out from under the knife  
Closin' the door on all those dreams you used to know  
Fallin' out of love and back on your feet  
Turnin' away from that dead end street  
Finding out that nothing feels as good as letting go  
  
That's when he called you up out of the blue one day  
And you know he thinks he's talkin' to the girl you used to be  
So when you tell him he's just a memory  
Ain't it funny how his voice cracks when you're sayin' goodbye  
And in the silence something begins to unravel  
He never knew you like he'll be knowing you now  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh and nothing feels as good as letting go  
He said he loved her

I remember it all very well lookin' back  
It was the summer I turned eighteen  
We lived in a one room, rundown shack  
On the outskirts of New Orleans  
We didn't have money for food or rent  
To say the least we were hard pressed  
Then Mama spent every last penny we had  
To buy me a dancin' dress  
  
Mama washed and combed and curled my hair  
And she painted my eyes and lips then I stepped into a satin  
Dancin' dress that had a split on the side clean up to my hip  
It was red velvet trim and it fit me good  
Standin' back from the lookin' glass  
There stood a woman where a half gown kid had stood  
  
She said here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down  
Here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down  
  
Mama dabbed a little bit of perfume on my neck  
And she kissed my cheek  
Then I saw the tears wellin' up in her troubled eyes  
When she started to speak  
She looked at a pitiful shack  
And then she looked at me and took a ragged breath  
She said your Pa's run off and I'm real sick  
And the baby's gonna starve to death  
  
She handed me a heart shaped locket that said  
"To thine own self be true"  
And I shivered as I watched a roach crawl across  
The toe of my high heel shoe  
It sounded like somebody else that was talkin'  
Askin' Mama what do I do  
She said just be nice to the gentlemen Fancy  
And they'll be nice to you  
  
She said here's your chance Fancy don't let me down  
Here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down  
Lord forgive me for what I do, but if you want out  
Well it's up to you  
Now don't let me down you better start movin' uptown  
  
Well, that was the last time I saw my Ma  
The night I left that rickety shack  
The welfare people came and took the baby  
Mama died and I ain't been back  
  
But the wheels of fate had started to turn  
And for me there was no way out  
And it wasn't very long 'til I knew exactly  
What my Mama's been talkin' about  
  
I knew what I had to do but I made myself this solemn vow  
That I's gonna be a lady someday  
Though I don't know when or how  
I couldn't see spending the rest of my life  
With my head hung down in shame you know  
I might have been born just plain white trash  
But Fancy was my name  
  
Here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down  
Here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down  
  
It wasn't very long after a benevolent man  
Took me off the street  
And one week later I was pourin' his tea  
In a five room hotel suite  
  
I charmed a king, a congressman  
And an occasional aristocrat  
Then I got me a Georgia mansion  
In an elegant New York townhouse flat  
And I ain't done bad  
  
Now in this world there's a lot of self-righteous hypocrite  
That would call me bad  
And criticize Mama for turning me out  
No matter how little we had  
  
But though I ain't had to worry 'bout nothin'  
For nigh on fifteen years  
I can still hear the desperation in my poor  
Mama's voice ringin' in my ear  
  
She said, here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down  
Here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down  
Lord, forgive me for what I do  
But if you want out well it's up to you  
Now don't let me down  
Your Mama's gonna help you uptown  
  
I guess she did

Uncle Slim had let her know she couldn't ride that horse  
He was the one that was only meant for men  
She walked around till way after dark  
Rode that horse with all her heart  
And in the night how she rode  
  
[Chorus]  
Somehow she always knew she had the strength inside  
And even if she fell she'd survive  
In spite of all the tears she may cry  
This is how she has to live her life  
As hard as it may be, she has to find out for herself  
  
Mama and daddy told her from the start he was no good  
They'd seen how he treated the other girls  
She waited around till the sun went down  
Slipped out of the house not makin' a sound  
And in the night oh how they drove  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It was fifteen years to the day he became a stranger in her eyes  
In the coldest words of anger  
He said without me you won't survive  
  
There's a suitcase in the closet she had packed six months ago  
She don't leave a note that's not her style  
So she waited around till way after dark  
Left that man who broke her heart  
Now she's gone, oh she's gone  
  
[Chorus]

There were no angry words at all  
As we carried boxes down the hall  
One by one we put them in your car  
Nothing much for us to say  
One last goodbye and you drove away  
I watched your tail-lights  
As they faded in the dark  
I couldn't face the night in that lonely bed  
So I laid down on the couch instead  
  
[Chorus]  
Last night I prayed the Lord my soul to keep  
Then I cried myself to sleep  
So sure life wouldn't go on without you  
But oh this sun is blinding me  
As it wakes me from the dark  
I guess the world didn't stop  
For my broken heart  
  
Clocks still tickin', life goes on  
Radio still plays a song  
As I try to put my scattered thoughts in place  
And it takes all the strength I've got  
To stumble to the coffee pot  
The first of many lonely mornings I've got to face  
You call to see if I'm ok  
Look out the window and I just say  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I guess the world ain't gonna stop  
For my broken heart

The first time I laid my eyes on you I knew  
We'd spend this life side by side  
I still feel the same though you're so far away  
I swear that you'll always be my  
  
Forever love  
I promise you  
Someday we'll be together  
Forever love  
I won't give up  
No matter what  
I'll be waiting for you  
Forever love  
  
Minutes and hours and years may go by  
But my heart knows nothing of time  
So don't cry just keep me right here in your dreams  
And hold on to these words of mine  
  
Forever love  
I promise you  
Someday we'll be together  
Forever love  
I won't give up  
No matter what  
I'll be waiting for you  
Forever love  
  
Love is the road to our destiny  
Nothing can change what is meant to be  
Forever love  
  
Oh, I won't give up  
No matter what  
I'll be waiting for you  
Forever love  
Forever love  
Forever love

Use to be (Use to be)  
Love was mean to me  
Every love I tried my heart cried that won't do  
Now you see (Now you see)  
Love's been good to me I guess my love was waiting just for you  
You and me (You and me) (You and me)  
Go so well as we  
Fit right to a T  
Can't you see we do  
  
[Repeat: x4]  
Gotta say (Gotta say) (Gotta say)  
Your love's got a way  
Of making me glad  
I waited just for you  
I should have known  
That my heart could not be wrong

(performed as THE SINGING McENTIRES)  
  
In a humble shack many years ago  
Before our Savior was born  
A little old lady was prayin' to  
God She cried "My son is gone"  
He's lost, he's lost, he's lost  
  
And suddenly she stopped praying  
And the tears dried from her eyes  
She said "But God, how would you know  
Your heart has never been broken  
And God, You never cried"  
  
God turned His face towards the earth  
And covered it with His hands  
He said "I must go and redeem my people  
And go in the form of a man"  
  
So He came to Earth a stranger  
Among His own people  
Came to live with man, came to understand  
The way of life  
Tears of strife were meant, for He was a man  
  
He grew to love His own creation  
And when His dearest friend died  
He knew the empty feeling of lonliness  
And at Lazurus' tomb, God cried  
  
And then came the day in the garden  
And pilots called Judgement Hall  
And there in the dark hills of Calvery  
Hanging between Earth and Heaven  
God wept and cried for them all  
For them all - for them all

(are. Carnes, S. Drake)  
  
Chorus:  
Gonna love ya till the cows come home  
Gonna love ya baby all night long  
Gonna love ya lordy me oh my  
Gonna love ya till the day I die  
  
Take your time morning is far away  
And the moon's leaning into the night  
So we won't be needing the light  
  
So (repeat chorus)  
  
Now you're mine  
There's no chance to run away  
While the stars are all turning to you  
Tell you what I'm gonna do  
  
Oh(repeat chorus)  
  
Tell me now  
It's love that you're feeling  
Fill my soul like you're filling my arms  
  
Oh(repeat chorus x2)

Feeling one another's joy and sorrow  
Dreams today may come true tomorrow  
Good friends  
Close together like they're bookends  
Feeling what the other one is feeling  
They never seem to be without  
Those little things to laugh about  
  
Good friends  
They have the kind of love  
That only deepens  
It's something that you rarely find worth keeping  
Oh people even new ones come  
You're lucky if you find just one good friend  
  
And we say goodbye  
Knowing what we have will fade away  
We'll meet another time  
Another day  
My friend  
  
Good friends  
Their paths may never come together again  
But in their hearts  
They're on a road with no end  
Where life will take us who can tell  
Guess it's time to say farewell  
My friend  
  
Good friends  
You never will forget  
Your good friends

Well you look like the kind who's got an eye for a bargain  
A kind of guy who likes to shop around  
Well I got me this old heart  
That I'm putting on the market  
And I'll make you a deal you can't turn down  
  
[Chorus]  
Have I got a deal for you  
A heart that's almost like brand new  
And I'll let it go so cheap  
You'll think you stole it 'fore you're through  
Have I got a deal for you  
  
Well you could search the whole world over  
And never find another like it  
It's got a built in lifetime guarantee  
It's a one time only offer  
And darling once you've tried it  
You're gonna fall in love with it you'll see  
  
[Chorus]

Like a rare piece of crystal  
Like a fine china cup  
I kept your memory all safely locked up  
Afraid I could never love somebody new  
I was trying to save what I had left of you  
  
Then he broke your memory last night  
I felt it shatter inside  
I guess he held me a little too right  
He broke your memory last night  
  
The moment he touched me with his gentle hands  
Your memory crumbled like a house built on sand  
He swept all the pieces of your love away  
And then gave me his love to put in it's place  
  
Cause he broke your memory last night  
I felt it shatter inside  
I guess he held me a little too right  
He broke your memory last night  
He broke your memory last night

(Sandy Knox, Anthony Little)  
  
He believes in the family unit  
The union of man and wife  
He believes that you stand before God  
For better, for worse and beyond this life  
  
He believes that a ring on his finger  
Is something to be proud of  
For all of the world to witness  
That he is committed to this love  
  
He wants to get married  
  
He'll build a house in the country  
Where he'll watch his children grow  
And teach them the values of something  
That most people never even know  
  
He wants to get married  
  
I never thought I would be so blessed  
To know a man like this  
He's everything, everything I believe that a man should be  
  
And when he is called to his maker  
He wants to go to his grave  
With his final remembrance of this earth  
To be one last look at his wife's face  
  
He wants to get married  
He wants to get married  
Oh, he wants to get married  
  
But not to me

Just when I thought that it never could happen to me  
He touched me and feelings that never have stirred in me  
Ever like this  
Are in his kiss  
  
[Chorus]  
Heart where are you taking me  
What will you make of me  
Is this the real thing  
And heart could he be paradise  
Cause in his eyes  
Do I see love looking at me  
  
Maybe I'm crazy  
For believing it's different this time  
Oh am I ready to feel what I've dreamed about  
Love that I've lived without finding  
Is finding me  
  
[Chorus]

He said I'll make your dreams come true in Texas  
And he captured my Appalachian heart  
I was so naive that I believed him  
When he promised we'd never be apart  
  
So we packed and pulled a you-Haul down to Dallas  
A year went by and the baby came along  
Then his old friends and the night life came between us  
Dreams turned into sleepless nights waiting all alone  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm staring out the window through these teardrops  
Holding on to the only dream that turned out right  
We're on a Greyhound bus bound for West Virginia  
He's in Dallas without us tonight  
  
Oh, Lord I hate to break the news to mama  
She's gettin' on in years and worries so  
Maybe I should have stayed in Dallas  
And gave him another chance right now I just don't know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
He said I'll make your dreams come true in Texas  
He's in Dallas without us tonight

In the eyes of the world he's only an ordinary man  
But there's a million and one things the eyes of the world never see  
He may walk the same  
He may talk the same  
As a million others do  
Oh but you'd see him as I do if his heart had eyes for you  
  
[Chorus: Repeat x2]  
He's only everything  
Only everything  
He's as real as the thrill I feel  
When he walks through my dreams  
He's the one I hold  
When my world grows cold  
And needs a touch of spring  
Or a song to sing  
Yes in these eyes of mine  
Lord he's only everything  
  
Yes in these eyes of mine  
Lord he's only everything

Hold on cause this feels just like a first love  
There's no way to rehearse love  
We'll just learn as we go  
  
I know you can see it in my eyes  
I've been looking in your eyes  
The feeling is starting to grow  
  
[Chorus]  
Hold on  
Love can take us up so high  
But it can take us down so low  
You either laugh or you cry  
Hold on  
Cause love's a chance that we're taking  
And I don't think we're mistaking  
We'll never know till we try  
  
Hold on  
Cause here comes all the conversations  
The painful midnight confessions  
That leave you feeling so sad  
  
I know we can make it forever  
If we just face it together  
Take the good with the good  
  
[Chorus: x2]

[Chorus]  
How blue can you make me  
How long till I heal  
How can I go on loving you when you're gone  
How blue can I feel  
  
Oh honey why did you leave me  
Ain't you got a heart left in your chest  
I swear to you that I'm dying  
Cause my mind won't let my body rest  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If I sink any lower I'll go under  
If I cry anymore I'll go blind  
Oh there ain't no relief for this missing you grief  
How long can you torture my mind  
  
[Chorus]  
  
How can I go on loving you when you're gone  
How blue can I feel

How did it happen  
When did we lose it  
The love we looked for so long  
I'm sorry I called you  
But it's the first night you see  
How does it feel to be free  
  
How does it feel now  
To reach out for someone  
And find there's nobody there  
Is it weighing on you  
Cause it's sure killing me  
Tell me how does it feel to be free  
  
Funny how love is so hard to find  
And yet so easy to lose  
Maybe in time this old heart of mine  
Can learn to be free without you  
  
How did it happen  
When did we lose it  
The love we looked for so long  
I'm sorry I called you  
But I just have to see  
How does it feel to be free  
  
I'm sorry I called you  
But it's the first night you see  
Now how does it feel to be free

My world revolved around you  
Every word was a promise I was hangin' on  
Swept up inside a whirlwind  
I just couldn't see the end till you were gone  
  
I thought I would fall apart  
(With) shattered dreams and a broken heart  
Scramblin' in the dark  
  
How was I to know  
That I'd be ok  
Thought I'd lose it all when you walked away  
How was I to know  
I would be this strong  
I had what it takes all along  
How was I to know  
  
What I was so afraid of  
Turned out to be my freedom in disguise  
Now i know what I'm made of  
Guess it just took some time to realize  
  
I was blind, I couldn't tell  
I put too much faith in someone else  
Gave up on myself  
  
How was I to know  
That I'd be ok  
Thought I'd lose it all when you walked away  
How was I to know  
I would be this strong  
I had what it takes all along  
How was I to know  

Well I don't need a caddy to make me happy  
Or a flat up on park avenue  
I don't need riches or treasures  
All those high priced pleasures darling  
All I need is you  
  
[Chorus]  
I know I don't need nothing you ain't got  
If you were coffee in the morning  
Well I'd drink that whole pot  
Cause you got everything all them others do not  
Darling I don't need nothing you ain't got  
  
Now Lord knows you ain't a saint  
Robert Redford you ain't  
But you got a heart of gold through and through  
And when it comes to loving  
All that kissing and hugging  
Ain't nobody else ever gonna do  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well now who thought I'd be satisfied  
With just one guy by my side  
Oh Lordy, Lordy look at me  
But hon you're different from the rest  
I'm here to confess  
That love from you is all I'm ever gonna need  
  
Well I don't need a caddy to make me happy  
Or a flat up on park avenue  
I don't need riches or treasures  
All those high priced pleasures darling  
All I need is you  
  
[Chorus]

Oh, I'm feeling so fine and you're looking so good  
And I'd like to get together  
Oh Lord, I wish we could  
But there's someone at home  
Who's depending on me  
And boy they'd never know it  
If I set my passions free  
  
But I don't think love ought to be that way  
No I don't think love ought to be that way  
I could tell him a lie  
And I know I'd get by  
But I don't think love ought to be that way  
  
You say a precious moment  
Is all that it would be  
That I'd forget about you  
And you'd forget me  
Oh I love what you're saying  
It's tempting me so  
And though I love to hear it  
There's no way that I'll let go  
  
But I don't think love ought to be that way  
No I don't think love ought to be that way  
I could tell him a lie  
And I know I'd get by  
But I don't think love ought to be that way  
  
No  
  
But I don't think love ought to be that way  
No I don't think love ought to be that way  
I could tell him a lie  
And I know I'd get by  
But I don't think love ought to be that way  
  
But I don't think love ought to be that way  
No I don't think love ought to be that way  
I could tell him a lie  
And I know I'd get by  
But I don't think love ought to be that way  
  
But I don't think love ought to be that way  
No I don't think love ought to be that way  
I could tell him a lie  
And I know I'd get by  
But I don't think love ought to be that way

Now you ask me if I will go with you  
Well I'd like to but I don't know if it's right  
Are you looking for someone to care for you  
Or just someone to love you tonight  
  
Well I don't want to be a one night stand  
So if that's what you got planned  
Baby before we go you better let me know  
I don't want to be a one night stand  
  
It been so long since I've had some loving  
And your kisses make me wish that you were mine  
Now it'd be so easy for me to fall for you  
And let myself have a good time  
  
Well I don't want to be a one night stand  
So if that's what you got planned  
Baby before we go you better let me know  
I don't want to be a one night stand  
  
Well I don't want to be a one night stand  
So if that's what you got planned  
Baby before we go you better let me know  
I don't want to be a one night stand  
  
Well I don't want to be a one night stand  
So if that's what you got planned  
Baby before we go you better let me know  
I don't want to be a one night stand

My nerves are shot, the coffee's cold.  
Wish that I could be so bold as to  
Walk right up to you and say what I think.  
I don't now what you think  
Of me.  
And I know everyone can see I'm crazy  
About you and always will be.  
  
Where's women's lib when you need it the most.  
Or was it mama who said  
You're not suppose to flaunt yourself like that  
As if there's no in between.  
Or maybe it's not that I'm afraid, it's just that the last move I made  
Embarrassed me to death and made me want to hide.  
  
So if you've ever been embarrassed before meet me half way  
And I'll know for sure.  
At least  
We'll still be friends if I mess up again.  
Cause it ain't easy meeting  
Someone new.  
Especially when that someone is you.  
It ain't easy by being by yourself.  
It's no fun to be alone,  
And I don't want to be alone.  
Cause it ain't easy meeting someone new.  
Especially when that someone is  
You.  
It ain't easy by being by yourself.  
It's no fun to be alone,  
And I don't want to be alone.  
  
My nerves are shot, the coffee's cold.  
Wish that I could be so bold as to walk  
Right up to you and say what I think.

I've got a story to tell, would you mind listening.  
I can always count on  
You we're such good friends.  
And I need to talk about my situation and  
You're the only one who'll understand.  
Now someone's got designs on my baby.  
She's making her intentions very plain.  
  
[Chorus]  
We both know this ole gal  
That I'm talking about, but I don't  
Want to mention any names.  
Well she's asked him to slow dance way too often.  
She's made suggestions I don't like at all.  
I'm trying to let her know that  
I'm wise to her game, but I  
Don't want to mention any names.  
  
Well I can understand why she'd want him.  
Oh you've even said yourself he's quite a prize.  
She's about a good of friend as you are.  
Come to think about it she's just about your size.  
If she don't back off there's gonna be some trouble.  
I'm prepared to make that very plain.  
I sure hope I've said enough, and just between the two of us.  
  
[Chorus]

Don't ask me just how it happened  
I wish I knew  
I can't believe that it happened  
And still it's true  
  
I got lost in his arms  
And I had to stay  
It was dark in his arms  
And I lost my way  
From the dark came a voice  
And it seemed to say  
There ya go, there ya go  
How I felt as I fell  
I just can't recall  
But his arms held me fast  
And it broke the fall  
And I said to my heart  
As it foolishly kept jumping around  
I got lost, but look what I found  
  
I got lost in his arms  
And I had to stay  
It was dark in his arms  
And I lost my way  
From the dark came a voice  
And it seemed to say  
There ya go, there ya go  
How I felt as I fell  
I just can't recall  
But his arms held me fast  
And it broke the fall  
And I said to my heart  
As it foolishly kept jumping around  
I got lost, but look what I found

The whole night in the kitchen  
Saying words we'll both regret  
And you scream you we're leaving  
And you cursed the day we met  
  
The sound goes above the slamming door  
And broken dishes thrown around the floor  
So loud it made us stop  
It was the sound of a teardrop  
  
[Chorus]  
When I heard her crying  
Thought she was tucked away in bed  
I heard her crying  
Wish we could take back what we said  
I didn't think she was old enough to know  
Oh Lord we must have hurt her so  
When she begged you not to go  
I heard her crying  
  
Well I'd have given anything  
For time to erase  
When I turned around and saw  
Those little tears roll down her face  
  
Oh my heart nearly broke in two  
When she said  
Mommy what did I do  
To make you and daddy mad  
Oh I'm sorry I was bad  
  
I looked at you and you looked at me  
And we felt each other's shame  
Kneeling down to hold our child  
Said she was not to blame  
Now sometimes when we're angry  
And say things that aren't true  
We still love each other  
And baby we love you  
  
[Chorus]

Love takes the patience of Job  
That's what my Mama always said  
Faith is the belief in something more than what you know  
That's what the Good Book says  
You gotta play the cards you got  
Who knows what fate is holding  
At times you gotta go without knowing where you're going  
  
That's why I keep on lovin' you  
I keep on lovin' you  
Through the baby don't leave mes  
And never will agains  
And I promise tos  
I keep on lovin' you  
  
Lord knows we've had our share of fights  
Our sleepless nights, our ups and downs  
We've had plenty and then some of baby I'm gones and turnarounds  
Sometimes I swear it might be easier to throw in the towel  
Someday we're gonna look back  
Say look at us now  
  
That's why I keep on lovin' you  
I keep on lovin' you  
Through the baby don't leave mes  
And never will agains  
And I promise tos  
I keep on lovin' you  
  
Keep on lovin' you  
Through the I take it backs  
I didn't mean it like that's  
I'd never hurt yous  
Oh, I keep on lovin' you  
  
I keep on lovin' you  
I keep on lovin' you  
Through the I take it backs  
I didn't mean it like that  
I'd never hurt yous  
Oh, I keep on lovin' you  
I keep on lovin' you  
I keep on lovin' you

Well I can't make it through this world by myself  
I need heaven's help to make through the day  
And if I go to bed tonight  
And remember to say my prayers  
I know I'll have a better day tomorrow  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause you've done what you said you'd do  
And you've given me lots of love  
And I've never known such peace  
Since I met you  
I'm so proud to be your child  
And I'm doing the best I can  
And I know I'll have a better day tomorrow  
  
Well  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I know I'll have a better day tomorrow

(robert jason)  
I've got someone in my life  
Who loves me wrong or right  
And I like it that way  
He gives me room to breathe  
But he's there for me  
And I like it that way  
I like it that way  
I like the way he says me name  
And how he's not afraid  
To open up and let his feelings show  
He's exactly what I need  
He loves me honestly  
One look in his eyes  
Tells me all I need to me know  
When he's on overtime  
I get that little ache inside  
And I like it that way  
We're as close as two can be  
But he's still him and I'm still me  
And I like it that way  
Yeah, I like it that way  

I fed the children  
And I kissed them goodnight  
You fed the jukebox  
Till they turn out the lights  
I bought the bacon  
While you bought the booze  
I've sacrificed more than you'll ever lose  
  
Needing new clothes with the money you spent  
On barbills and motels and women you met  
But I stood the heartache that you put me through  
I've sacrificed more than you'll ever lose  
  
I gave up so much  
And now I'm giving up you  
It's too late to make up for  
The love that you used  
  
I've had enough  
I don't want you around  
Don't look at me  
Like I let you down  
You say I'm to blame  
But who's fooling who  
I've sacrificed more than you'll ever lose  
Yeah I sacrificed more than you'll ever lose

Christmas toys all over the place  
Little Shelby wears a funny smile on his face  
Shelby has a secret  
And the secret he must share  
He wants to tell somebody  
So he tells his teddy bear  
  
[Chorus:]  
I saw Mama kissing Santa Claus  
Underneath the mistletoe last night  
She didn't see me creep  
Down the stairs to have a peek(it says peep but go with peek)  
She thought that I was tucked up in my bedroom fast asleep  
Then, I saw Mama tickle Santa Claus  
Underneath his beard so snowy white  
Oh, what a laugh it would have been  
If Daddy had only seen  
Mama kissing Santa Claus last night  
  
[Repeat Chorus]

Everybody told me he was a dream  
Picture perfect like he stepped right off the silver screen  
Said that he would sweep me off my feet  
But I'm still standing no he didn't do it for me  
'cause I don't go for all that wine and dine  
With the ray ban fake tan never mind  
  
I want a down home up with the sun rise man  
A pick-up truck driving bull riding strong steady hand  
I want the wranglers stetson and all that stuff  
I want the real McCoy  
I want a cowboy  
  
I'm tired of talking 'bout it wasting my time  
On all the cheap talkers needing me feeding me lines  
Give me somebody who's tender but tough  
Simple and honest knows a thing or two about love  
I've seen enough to know I know what I like  
It's the hard working head turning rugged type  
  
I want a down home up with the sun rise man  
A pick-up truck driving bull riding strong steady hand  
I want the wranglers stetson and all that stuff  
I want the real McCoy  
I want a cowboy  
  
I've seen enough to know you know what I mean  
Ride me off into the sunset that's my thing  
  
I want a down home up with the sun rise man  
A pick-up truck driving bull riding strong steady hand  
I want the wranglers stetson and all that stuff  
I want the real McCoy  
I want the real McCoy  
I want a cowboy  
I want a cowboy a cowboy

If all our love is through  
If you found someone new  
Then I want to hear it from you  
  
If there is no mistake  
And if my heart must break  
I want to hear it from you  
  
Just the thought of losing you  
Is more than I can stand  
But this hurt would be much worse  
If I heard it secondhand  
If there's no hope at all  
If my world must fall  
I want to hear it from you  
  
So tell me now  
If things are not the way they used to be  
I want to hear it from your lips  
You owe that much to me  
  
If all our love is through  
If you found someone new  
Then I want to hear it from you

Oh I know it's hard for you to say it's over  
Well it's twice as hard for me to let you go  
Out there I hope you find a softer shoulder  
But before you leave there's something you should know  
  
[Chorus]  
I was glad to give my everything to you  
Yeah we almost made our every dream come true  
And though we didn't have the chance to see it through  
I was glad to give my everything to you  
  
Oh you say you need a little room for breathing  
Somehow I guess you know I'd understand  
And though you're hurting me  
I still can't help in believing  
I'd be glad if I could do it all again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh I was glad to give my everything to you

How do you tell someone you're letting go?  
I wish that I could tell you  
But you're askin' me things that I don't know  
I wish that I could tell you  
Words that I would say  
Sound as empty as the way you feel inside  
While the silence in between  
Tells me everything that you deny  
I don't know how to help you  
I wish that I could tell you  
How to tell me goodbye  
I don't know how you leave it all behind  
I wish that I could tell you  
Is it true a heart heals itself with time  
I wish that I could tell you  
How do you choose?  
Do you hurt 'em with the truth or with a lie?  
Where do you go to find the courage  
You know I could never find?  
I don't know how to help you  
I wish that I could tell you  
How to tell me goodbye  
Where do you turn, where do you go?  
When you've finally reached the end of the road?  
How do you say it, I just don't know  
When it comes to leaving you're on your own  
How do you tell someone you're letting go?  
I wish that I could tell you  
Oh, wish that I could tell you  

You told me I was one in a million  
Everything you wanted in this world  
Every time I turn around  
I hear tell you paint the town  
With one of this million other girls  
  
Oh, watcha do to me is not the question  
I swear I felt the magic from the start  
I see the promise of a legendary love  
But I am not about to share your heart  
  
[Chorus]  
I'd do almost anything just to make you mine  
But I won't stand in line  
I won't stand in line waiting for your call  
I won't take a number, just to take a fall  
So make up your mind  
I won't stand in line  
  
Oh, how long do you think that you can handle  
Keeping all those hearts up in the air  
Don't you know in time you're bound to stumble  
And when that day comes it won't be my affair  
  
[Chorus: x 2]  
  
Oh, I won't stand in line  
I won't stand in line  
I won't stand in line  
I'd do almost anything if I could make you mine  
I won't stand in line  
I won't stand in line  
I'd do almost anything if I could make you mine  
I won't stand in line  
I won't stand in line  
I won't stand in line  
I won't stand in line  
I'd do almost anything if I could make you mine  
I won't stand in line

I'll never forget that night long ago  
When he drove me down that old dusty road  
He took me as far as I'd ever been  
He wanted me and I wanted him  
But I'd always been told I shouldn't give in  
  
[Chorus]  
I wouldn't go that far  
I didn't follow my heart  
He said he loved me  
But I wasn't ready  
And I wouldn't go that far  
  
He was so patient, he didn't give up  
With a ring in his hand and a heart full of love  
He asked me for forever, I asked him to wait  
To please understand these dreams I must chase  
Though it was a promise I wanted to make  
  
[Chorus]  
  
After all these years. I saw him again  
He had his wife and his family with him  
He said he was proud of all my success  
He guessed both of us had found happiness  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yes, I knew he loved me  
But I wasn't ready  
And I wouldn't go that far

Everyone I see these days still asks me about you  
I guess they got so used to us together they assume  
That everything's ok and then I have to say  
  
I wouldn't know I haven't seen him  
I couldn't say it's been awhile  
I haven't thought about him lately  
So I wouldn't know  
I'm getting tired of people askin'  
Why can't they just leave me alone  
Cause I couldn't care, I couldn't say, I wouldn't know  
  
I don't get out anymore to our old stompin' grounds  
Cause some old friend is bound to ask me why you're not around  
Well I just stay away, so I don't have to say  
  
I wouldn't know I haven't seen him  
I couldn't say it's been awhile  
I haven't thought about him lately  
So I wouldn't know  
I'm getting tired of people askin'  
Why can't they just leave me alone  
Cause I couldn't care, I couldn't say, I wouldn't know  

You don't have a clue  
You're so far gone  
He's got you dancin' to  
A siren's song  
  
[Chorus]  
I wouldn't want to be you right now  
I wouldn't want to be  
I wouldn't want to be you right now  
I wouldn't want to be, I wouldn't want to be  
  
You're not the first he's drawn  
To his flame  
He means to do you wrong  
He has no shame  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's easy to understand  
How you could fall so hard  
You're not the only one  
He's taken in and torn apart  
  
Won't say I told you so  
But I'm afraid it's true  
You're about to go  
What I went through  
  
[Chorus]

My cousin's gettin' married at the Methodist church  
That's why I stayed home from work  
I'm supposed to hold the flowers  
When the new bride kisses the groom  
That's what I'm supposed to do  
So what are we doin' with the windows rolled down  
Twenty five passionate miles from town  
I love ?er like a sister baby, but to tell you the truth  
I'd rather ride around with you  
  
The guy she's gonna marry's got money to burn  
His daddy's a partner in some big law firm  
Yeah, that's how they're goin'  
To Hawaii on their honeymoon  
First class to Honolulu  
She ain't ever even set foot on a jet  
I'm a little bit jealous I confess  
I'd like to fly to Hawaii but honey if I had to choose  
I'd rather ride around with you  
  
I don't care where this road goes  
No I don't wanna turn around  
Let go of the wheel and feel the wind blow  
Don't even think about slowin' down  
  
They're tyin' tin cans to the back of the car  
Wonderin' where in the world we are  
The preacher's done prayin'  
And the couple's done sayin' I do  
That could be me and you  
There's way too many decisions to make  
The length of the dress, the layers on the cake  
One of these days I might get married too  
But I'd rather ride around with you  
  
I don't care where this road goes  
No I don't wanna turn around  
Let go of the wheel and feel the wind blow  
Don't even think about slowin' down  

If I had only known  
It was the last walk in the rain  
I'd keep you out for hours in the storm  
I would hold your hand  
Like a life line to my heart  
Underneath the thunder we'd be warm  
If I had only known  
It was our last walk in the rain  
  
If I had only known  
I'd never hear your voice again  
I'd memorize each thing you ever said  
And on those lonely nights  
I could think of them once more  
Keep your words alive inside my head  
If I had only known  
I'd never hear your voice again  
  
You were the treasure in my hand  
You were the one who always stood beside me  
So unaware I foolishly believed  
That you would always be there  
But then there came a day  
And I turned my head and you slipped away  
  
If I had only known  
It was my last night by your side  
I'd pray a miracle would stop the dawn  
And when you'd smile at me  
I would look into your eyes  
And make sure you know my love  
For you goes on and on  
If I had only known  
If I had only known  
The love I would've shown  
If I had only known

If I were a boy even just for a day  
I'd roll out of bed in the morning and throw on what I wanted and go  
  
Drink beer with the guys and chase after girls  
I'd kick it with who I wanted and I'd never get confronted for it,  
'Cause they stick up for me  
  
If I were a boy, I think I could under stand  
How it feels to love a girl, I swear I'd be a better man  
  
And I'd listen to her,'cause I know how it hurts  
When you lose the one you wanted, 'cause he's takin' you for granted  
And everything you had got destroyed  
  
If I were a boy, I would turn off my phone  
Tell everyone it's broken, so they'd think that I was sleepin' alone  
  
I'd put myself first and make the rules as I go  
'Cause I know that she'll be faithful, waitin' for me to come home,  
To come home  
  
And if I were a boy, I think I could understand  
How it feels to love a girl, I swear I'd be a better man  
  
And I'd listen to her, 'cause I know how it hurts  
When you lose the one you wanted, 'cause he's takin' you for granted  
And everything you had got destroyed  
  
It's a little too late for you to come back  
Say it's just a mistake, think I'd for give you like that  
If you thought I would wait for you, you thought wrong  
  
But you're just a boy, you don't understand, you don't understand  
Oh, how it (feels to love a girl someday, you wish you were a better man  
Oh, you don't listen to her, and you don't care how it hurts  
Until you lose the one you wanted, 'cause you're takin' her for granted  
And everything you had got destroyed  
  
But you're just a boy

If only I'd have thought to send you roses  
For no reason just to send you roses  
And if only I thought to say more often I love you  
But I just assumed you knew  
  
[Chorus]  
And if only I'd have tried a little harder  
If only we'd have talked a little more  
If only I'd have held you closer  
Then maybe I'd be holding you tonight  
If only you, if only I  
The saddest words are not goodbye  
They're if only  
  
If only we hadn't just pretended there was nothing wrong  
It might not have ended  
If only we'd have given more attention  
To the small things  
We might have it all today  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Instead of silence  
There'd been angry words  
If we had only listened  
We just might have held our hearts  
  
[Chorus]

(tommy lee james, jennifer kimball, terry mcbride)  
  
If you see him, tell him I wish him well. how am I doing? well sometimes  
Its hard to tell. I still miss him more than ever. but please don't say a
word.  
If you see him. if you see him.  
  
If you see her, tell her Im doing fine. and if you want to, say that I think  
Of her from time to time. ask her if she ever wonders where we both went
wrong.  
If you see her. if you see her. I still want her.  
  
And I still need him so.  
  
I don't know why we let each other go.  
  
If you see her, tell her the lights still on for her.  
  
Nothings changed deep down the fire still burns for him. and even if  
It takes forever, say I'll still be here. if you see him.  
  
If you see her.  
  
If you see him.  
  
If you see her.

When darkness falls upon your heart and soul.  
I'll be the light that shines for you.  
When you forget how beautiful you are  
I'll be there to remind you.  
When you can't find your way,  
I'll find my way to you.  
When troubles come around,  
I will come to you.  
  
I'll be your shoulder when you need someone to lean on.  
Be your shelter.  
When you need someone to see you through.  
I'll be there to carry you.  
I'll be there.  
I'll be the rock that will be strong for you.  
The one that will hold on to you.  
When you feel that rain falling down.  
When there's nobody else around.  
I'll be.  
  
And when you're there with no one there to hold.  
I'll be the arms that reach for you.  
And when you feel your faith is running low.  
I'll be there to believe in you.  
When all you find are lies.  
I'll be the truth you need.  
When you need someone to run to.  
You can run to me  
  
I'll be your shoulder when you need someone to lean on.  
Be your shelter.  
When you need someone to see you through.  
I'll be there to carry you.  
I'll be there.  
I'll be the rock that will be strong for you.  
The one that will hold on to you.  
When you feel that rain falling down.  
When there's nobody else around.  
I'll be.  
  
I'll be the sun.  
When your heart's filled with rain.  
I'll be the one.  
To chase the rain away.  
  
I'll be your shoulder when you need someone to lean on.  
Be your shelter.  
When you need someone to see you through.  
I'll be there to carry you.  
I'll be there.  
I'll be the rock that will be strong for you.  
The one that will hold on to you.  
When you feel that rain falling down.  
When there's nobody else around.  
I'll be.  
I'll be.

I'm dreaming tonight of the place I love  
Even more then I usually do  
And although I know it's a long road back  
This I promise you  
  
Well, I'll be home for Christmas  
You can plan on me  
So please have snow and lots of mistletoe  
And presents under the tree  
  
Oh Christmas Eve will find me  
Where the love life is  
I'll be home for Christmas  
If only in my dreams  
  
You know Christmas Eve will find me  
Where the love life is  
Darling I'll be home for Christmas  
If only in my dreams  
Oh if only in my dreams

Well there's a half moon starlit sky.  
All the conditions are just right.  
Our song's playing on the  
radio. Every beat of my heart is saying just let go.  
'Cause when you're holding me this way.  
It's all I can do to just think straight.  
A little voice in my head is saying not so fast.  
If you really want this love to last.  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm gonna catch my breath.  
I'm gonna count to ten.  
I'm gonna leave you wonderin' when you'll see me again.  
I'm gonna say goodnight with one passionate kiss.  
And leave you with the strongest feeling there is.  
I'll give you something to miss.  
  
I'm not doin' something I'll regret.  
I'm playing it just hard enough to get.  
I'm gonna give you a little space.  
And let you enjoy the thrill of the chase.  
  
[Chorus: x2]

No, I don't want no 'Jack n Coke'  
Please sit me where there ain't no smoke  
Don't want nothin' cloudin' up my eyes  
But you see that girl all over there  
Actin' like she's on thin air  
There got to be a secret to her smile  
Well, I think that I just found him  
And he's twirlin' her around  
I'd like to place my order  
You might want to write this down  
  
I'll have what she's havin'  
I want what she's got  
Someone sweet as he can be  
And by the way, that hot  
A tall order, I suppose  
But if you could find me one of those  
I'll have what she's havin'  
  
Well, I like the way he looks at her  
It's plain to see, he knows the words  
That makes her shine from 40 feet away  
If there's any justice in this world  
He's got a twin who wants a girl  
Who looks like me, excuse me while I pray  
So if you could slip my number  
In that pocket on his hip  
It would be appreciated  
And reflected in your tip  
  
I'll have what she's havin'  
I want what she's got  
Someone sweet as he can be  
And by the way, that hot  
A tall order, I suppose  
But if you can find me one of those  
I'll have what she's havin'  
  
A tall order, I suppose  
But if you can find me one of those  
I'll have what she's havin'  
  
Well, I know it's wrong to think of it  
But why should she have all of it  
I'll have what she's havin'  
  
Oh, I'll have what she's havin'

Changing my life, with your love,  
Has been so easy for you,  
And I'm amazed, every day, and I'll need you.  
'Till all the mountains are valleys,  
And every ocean is dry, my love.  
  
I'll be yours until the sun doesn't shine,  
'Till time stands still  
Until the winds don't blow,  
When today is just a memory to me, I know.  
I'll still be lovin', I'll still be lovin' you.  
I'll still be lovin' you.  
  
Never before did I know,  
How lovin' someone could be,  
Now I can see, you and me, for a lifetime.  
Until the last moon's rising,  
You'll see the love in my eyes, my love.  
  
I'll be yours until the sun doesn't shine,  
'Till time stands still,  
Until the winds don't blow.  
When today is just a memory to me, I know.  
I'll still be lovin', I'll still be lovin' you.  
  
I'll be yours until the sun doesn't shine,  
'Till time stands still.  
Until the winds don't blow.  
When today is just a memory to me, I know.  
I'll still be lovin', I'll still be lovin' you.  
I'll still be lovin' you.  
  
I'll still be lovin', I'll still be lovin'  
I'll still be lovin' you  
I'll still be lovin', I'll still be lovin'  
I'll still be lovin' you

Movin' up where you want to be  
Talking tough, that won't work with me  
It's my heart, it ain't Hollywood  
You want it baby  
Oh you got to be good  
  
(Heyya) mm  
(Heyya) heyyy  
(Heyya) ooo  
(Hey Hey ya)  
  
Take you up where you never been  
Tie your seat belt, oh strap yourself in  
Start a rumor, nothing to it  
Oh it's you and me baby are just the ones to do it  
  
I don't want to be the lonely game in town  
I just want to be the only girl around  
Yeah I'm gonna take you straight to the top  
Never gonna stop  
Show you what I got  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'll take your heart (I'll take your heart)  
Before you know it's gone  
Leave you standing but you won't be alone  
Take your rhythm and leave you out of time  
I'll take everything and give you all of mine  
(I'll take your heart) I'll take your heart  
And you ain't gonna feel it  
Can't do nothing babe  
You know I'm gonna steal it  
  
And I'll take your heart  
Before you know it's gone  
(Heyya, Heyya, Heyya, Hey Hey Heyya)  
  
Lady luck just be good to me  
Send me love special delivery  
Ain't in a movie, I ain't on TV  
I'm a living, loving breathing leading kind of lady  
I don't want to be alone at the end of the phone  
I just want to be the one that turns you on  
  
Yeah I'm gonna take you straight to the top  
Never gonna stop  
Show you what I got  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Some girls will cut you like a knife  
Some girls will even stay the night  
But this girl is gonna stay for life  
Ya know it's right  
  
(Heyya) mm  
(Heyya) heyy  
(Heyya) oo  
(Hey Hey ya)  
  
[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

Well I'm flying out of Tulsa  
Trying to get out to the coast  
Missing my connections  
But it's you I miss the most  
  
I'm in love all over (echo)  
I'm in love all over (echo)  
Well I'm in love all over  
Everywhere I go  
  
Well my heart feels like bursting  
When you walk into the room  
My lips just start thirsting  
For another kiss from you  
  
I'm in love all over (echo)  
Yes I'm in love all over (echo)  
I'm in love all over  
From my head down to my shoes  
  
In search of true affection  
I found a new direction  
And that's straight to you  
Oh I use to like to play around  
But I can see that's all over now  
  
Oh my friends sure like to gossip  
Think they know the gospel truth  
Words leak like a faucet  
When it comes to me and you  
  
I'm in love all over (echo)  
Oh I'm in love all over (echo)  
Yes I'm in love all over  
Everywhere I go  
I'm in love all over  
From my head down to toes  
I'm in love all over  
Everybody knows about me and you  
  
In search of true affection  
I found a new direction  
And that's straight to you  
Oh I use to like to play around  
But I can see that's all over now  
  
Oh my friends sure like to gossip  
Think they know the gospel truth  
Words leak like a faucet  
When it comes to me and you  
  
I'm in love all over (echo)  
Oh I'm in love all over (echo)  
Yes I'm in love all over  
Everywhere I go  
I'm in love all over  
From my head down to toes  
I'm in love all over  
Everybody knows about me and you  
  
Oh yes they do  
Cause I'm in love all over  
I'm in love all over  
Yes I'm in love all over  
Yes I'm in love all over

I don't mind to give you a slow dance or two  
I'm sorry I'm not at my best  
I know you can see I'm incredibly blue  
But I'm not that lonely yet  
  
I look in your eyes while you're dancing with me  
And try to fulfill your request  
But don't ask for favors when it's time to leave  
Cause I'm not that lonely yet  
  
Now don't say you want me  
I've heard that before  
The words weigh like stones in my head  
There may come a time when I'll think of you more  
But I'm not that lonely yet  
  
It's nice to be dancing  
To waltzes again  
And maybe it helps to forget  
You've opened the door but I'm not waltzing in  
Cause I'm not that lonely yet  
No I'm not that lonely yet

She married when she was twenty  
She thought she was ready  
Now she's not so sure  
She thought she'd done some living  
But now she's just wonderin'  
What she's living for  
Now she's feeling that there's something more  
  
[Chorus]  
Is there life out there  
So much she hasn't done  
Is there life beyond  
Her family and her home  
She's done what she should  
Should she do what she dares  
She doesn't want to leave  
She's just wonderin  
Is there life out there  
  
She's always lived for tomorrow  
She's never learned how  
To live for today  
She's dyin' to try something foolish  
Do something crazy  
Or just get away  
Something for herself for a change  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There's a place in the sun that she's never been  
Where life is fair and time is a friend  
Would she do it the same as she did back then  
She looks out the window and wonders again  
  
[Chorus: x2]

(Feat. Barry Manilow)  
  
Baby when I met you there was peace unknown  
I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb  
I was soft inside  
There was something going on  
You do something to me that I can't explain  
Hold me closer and I feel no pain  
Every beat of my heart  
We got something going on  
Tender love is blind  
It requires a dedication  
All this love we feel needs no conversation  
We can ride it together, ah ha  
Making love with each other, ah ha  
  
Islands in the stream  
That is what we are  
No one in between  
How can we be wrong  
Sail away with me  
To another world  
And we rely on each other, ah ha  
From one lover to another, ah ha  
  
I can't live without you if the love was gone  
Everything is nothing when you got no one  
And you walk in the night  
Slowly losing sight of the real thing  
But that wont happen to us and we got no doubt  
Too deep in love and we got no way out  
And the message is clear  
This could be the year for the real thing  
No more will you cry  
Baby I will hurt you never  
We start and end as one  
In love forever  
We can ride it together, ah ha  
Making love with each other, ah ha  
  
Islands in the stream  
That is what we are  
No one in between  
How can we be wrong  
Sail away with me  
To another world  
And we rely on each other, ah ha  
From one lover to another, ah ha

We've got a nice little house on a quiet little street  
But it don't matter  
A two garage with a new Cherokee  
But it don't matter  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause we don't ever seem to talk anymore  
And you don't hold me like you did before  
We've got everything we wanted and more  
But now I know and now I see  
Nothing matters if you don't love me  
  
We've given twelve precious years of our lives  
But it don't matter  
And I guess for awhile we were both satisfied  
But it don't matter  
It wouldn't be easy to walk out tonight  
But it don't matter  
And I know I would miss you if you said goodbye  
But it don't matter

Silence is golden  
When the one that you're holding  
Means more then love words can say  
But what I don't hear  
From you makes me fear  
That our love is slipping away  
  
The quiet's so loud  
It fills up the house  
With words that can't be set free  
So who'll break the curse  
And say the first word  
Well I don't know  
We're not talking you see  
  
[Chorus]  
It's another silent night  
It's a cold war of who's wrong or right  
Nobody's winning this unspoken fight  
It's another silent night  
  
If we could just talk  
And tear down the wall  
That stands there between our hearts  
We could put back together  
Our love for each other  
Before it all falls apart  
  
[Chorus: x2]

[Chorus]  
It's gotta be love  
That keeps us together  
It's gotta be a feeling from the heart  
It's gotta be love  
It must last forever  
Or I won't let the fire start  
It's gotta be love  
  
I don't have time for a part time love affair  
I can't pretend it's love when it's not really there  
So don't you lead me on if you don't really care  
It's gotta be real  
And I got a feeling  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I can't just let you take my love and walk away  
And you must know that love is not a game I play  
So when you say you love me  
You better mean just what you say  
  
It's gotta be real  
And I got a feeling  
  
[Chorus: x2]

You can tell everyone  
Love is over and done  
You can pack all your things and go  
  
You can lie to yourself  
And say that there's nothing left  
But there's something that I like you to know  
  
It's never really over  
Even though you say we're through  
You may be holding me  
But can't you see  
It's not over if I'm not over you  
  
There's not much I can do  
If it's over for you  
I'll just wish you the best  
When you leave  
But you played such a part  
In my life and in my heart  
You'll always be part of me  
  
It's never really over  
Even though you say we're through  
You may be holding me  
But can't you see  
It's not over if I'm not over you

It's your call, It's her  
Would you rather take it in the other room  
She's hangin' on and so am I  
Yeah, I know all about it don't act so surprised  
  
It's time to end this game you're playin'  
She's not the only one who's waitin' on the line  
  
It's your call  
It's up to you  
And I won't try to stop you if you go  
But if you stay tell her goodbye  
I can't take another minute  
I can't stand another night  
  
Of wondering if I even matter  
It's something only you can answer  
Here's the phone, It's your call  
  
There's no easy way out this time  
Cause I won't live this way  
She called here to talk to you  
With a message that I can't take  
  
Oh, I've got to know if I still matter  
It's somethin' only you can answer  
Here's the phone, It's your call

The sun is shining down  
There's not one cloud around  
Morning hits me  
Where I lay  
  
Everything was green  
A perfect day it seems  
Yeah he's got everything his way  
Oh but I've seen better days  
I've seen better days  
  
[Chorus]  
When the rain was pouring down  
And he had his loving arms wrapped around me  
I've seen better days  
  
The neighbors come and go  
They smile and wave hello  
And all the kids are out to play  
  
Lollipops and good times  
They look so much like mine  
But he has taken mine away  
Oh and I've seen better days  
Lord I've seen better days  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh Lord I miss 'em  
I've seen better days

You know I can't find the letters you wrote to me in school.  
And that shoebox full of photographs got lost in my last move.  
I gave away that old twin bed where you and I first laid.  
But after all this time, I've still got the love we made.  
And that old beat up car we dated in, finally turned to rust.  
And the first rose that you gave me, oh it finally turned to dust.  
But all those tender nights we shared are never gonna fade.  
  
Cause after all this time I've still got the love we made.  
I've got every feeling we felt when touched.  
Cause even though fell apart I kept a part of us.  
I've held on to every time we held each other tight,  
And promised that no matter  
What we'd never say goodbye.  
I don't have one souvenir  
Of us I'd meant to save, but right here in my heart  
I've still got the love we made.  
Oh right here in my heart  
I've still got the love we made.

Jolene, Jolene  
Jolene, Jolene  
I'm beggin' of you  
Please don't take my man  
Jolene, Jolene  
Jolene, Jolene  
Please don't take him  
Even though you can  
  
Your beauty is beyond compare  
With flaming locks of auburn hair  
With ivory skin  
And eyes of emerald green  
He talks about you in his sleep  
There's nothing I can do to keep from cryin'  
When he calls your name Jolene  
  
Jolene, Jolene  
Jolene, Jolene  
I'm beggin' of you  
Please don't take my man  
Jolene, Jolene  
Jolene, Jolene  
Please don't take him  
Even though you can  
  
Well you can have your choice of men  
But I could never love again  
He's the only one for me Jolene  
I had to have this talk with you  
My happiness depends on you  
And whatever you decide to do Jolene  
  
Jolene, Jolene  
Jolene, Jolene  
I'm beggin' of you  
Please don't take my man  
Jolene, Jolene  
Jolene, Jolene  
Please don't take him  
Even though you can  
  
Jolene  
Jolene  
Jolene

When our check bounces at the store  
And the whole world seems at war  
You bring me peace of mind once more  
With just a little love  
  
When the boss says I'm ten minutes late  
And the stack of bills just won't wait  
Oh, you take the worries away  
With just a little love  
  
[Chorus]  
Just a little love  
And affection  
You bring a touch of perfection  
To a world that's sometimes crazy  
And so mixed up  
Just a little love  
You have changed me  
You make me see why the good Lord made me  
And you can do miracles  
With just a little love  
  
When our old car won't run  
And all my dreams come undone  
You'll make it right won't ya hun  
With just a little love  
  
When it seems like all the truths are gone  
When I'm trying so hard to hold on  
You make it easy to be strong  
With just a little love  
  
[Chorus]

She can concentrate on workin'  
Until her work is done  
She can hold a conversation  
As well as anyone  
She'll fool you with sincerity  
And if you didn't know her well  
You would never see it  
You could never tell  
  
[Chorus]  
She's just looking for him  
She's only rememberin'  
She might look like she's ready  
To fall in love again  
But she's just looking for him  
  
She keeps one eye on the road  
And one on the other lane  
Lookin' for his car  
His memory's re-played  
She searches other faces  
Tryin' to find that spark  
But no one new can reach her  
Or fill her hollow heart  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh you'd better keep your distance  
Don't let her reel you in  
She's not quite herself now  
How could she be when  
  
[Chorus]

3 o'clock in the mornin' when the telephone started ringin  
I had a feelin' it wouldd be you  
I'd didn't want to take it but I let my imagination think  
Of some kind of trouble you gotten into  
And I just had to answer n you had to stop cryin  
And I, I tried to fight it  
But I thought if I didn't listen to you  
That I wouldn''t be much of a friend  
I let you come over n cry on my shoulder  
For the hundredth time over again  
And all those old emotions came rainin out of the room  
Just when I thought I'd stopped lovin' you  
  
You got a way of knowin when I'm on the edge of givin in  
And how to use those beautiful eyes  
So if one day you're askin' me, if I ever thought that maybe  
We outta give it one more try?  
And I just had to answer n you, you had to start smilin  
And I thought about lyin'  
But I thought if I wasn't honest with you  
That I wouldn't be much of a friend  
I let you come over n cry on my shoulder  
For the hundredth time over again  
And all those old emotions came rainin' out of the room  
Just when I thought I'd stopped lovin' you  
  
Oh I hate you for makin' me crazy  
So why is it that I...  
I keep on takin' you right back baby?  
But I thought if I didn't listen to you  
That I wouldn't be much of a friend  
I let you come over n cry on my shoulder  
For the hundredth time over again  
And all those old emotions came rainin' out of the room  
Just when I thought I'd stopped lovin' you  
Just when I thought I'd stopped lovin' you  
  
You take two steps down the highway  
But you come runnin' back  
What am I supposed to do?  
What am I supposed to do?  
What am I supposed to do with that?  
Wrap my arms around you!  
Yeah eh yeah

I watch you as you wake and rub your eyes and try to hide them from the  
  
Morning sun  
I whisper how ya doing and you smile and say so tenderly good morning  
Hun  
  
[Chorus]  
Last night you made his memory fade a little  
You helped me see how love can still be right  
I wish you didn't have to leave  
If you just knew how much I need  
Last night, ev'ry night  
  
I know you have to catch a plane to Memphis  
And you mentioned it's an early flight  
You start to pack  
And while I comb my hair  
I stare at you and think about last night  
  
Cause [Chorus]  
  
I slip into my robe to go make coffee  
You come in and pull me close to you  
And as I feel your tender kiss  
I whisper can't Memphis wait a day or two  
Cause [Chorus]  
  
Cause [Chorus]

Well you say you're from the city  
California is your home  
Hey I'm a country girl over Oklahoma way  
Oh there are miles and miles between us  
But that don't mean a thing  
When those guitars start to play  
Oh, sweet sounds of freedom  
Ringing through the air  
Sending out a message to us all  
We don't have a curtain  
Made of iron or stone  
We are not divided by a wall  
So come on tell me  
Hey, hey, hey  
From L.A. to Broadway  
Hey, hey, hey  
Let the music lift you up  
Hey, hey, hey  
Whoa, everybody's singin'  
Hey, hey, hey  
Let the music lift you up  
When you're feelin' low  
Hit that radio  
Let the music lift you  
Let the music lift you  
Up, way up, way up  
There are books that tell us  
What makes this whole world turn  
And how Heaven holds the star wars  
But there's no explanation  
Lord it's still a mystery  
How a song can touch your heart  
So come on, tell me  
Hey, hey, hey  
From L.A. to Broadway  
Hey, hey, hey  
Let the music lift you up  
Hey, hey, hey  
Whoa, everybody's singin'  
Hey, hey, hey  
Let the music lift you up  
Let the music lift you  
Let the music lift you  
Up, way up, way up  

I guess it finally dawned on me you're gone  
Well maybe I can make it on my own  
I don't stay up wonderin' if you'll call  
And some nights I don't dream of you at all  
  
Your memory's still hurtin' deep inside  
That's something I'm still learnin' how to hide  
Though this heart of mine has lost an ache or two  
I've only turned a lighter shade of blue  
  
[Chorus]  
Lookin' down the line sometimes  
I think I see a change  
But then I think again and think of you  
Here and there I've turned a stone  
But the mountain hasn't moved  
I've only turned a lighter shade of blue  
  
I'm still afraid of turning out the light  
And it takes all my strength to face the night  
Cause that's the time I face the bitter truth  
I've only turned a lighter shade of blue  
  
[Chorus]

Daddy used to tell me  
If I ran too fast I'd fall and hurt myself  
But the ice cream man would ring his bell  
And I'd get there before anyone else  
  
I'd see a puppy in the window  
And I'd run and press my face against the pane  
And Daddy'd say slow down girl  
After all these years I guess nothing has changed  
  
[Chorus]  
That little girl I knew  
Ran after you  
But she fell this time  
And broke her heart in two  
Hey that's just like a little girl I knew  
  
Back home there stands an old house  
With a picket fence beneath a big oak tree  
I can almost see the backyard  
And a little girl with freckles  
That was me  
  
And there were dreams of toys and storybooks and  
Lord it seemed I wanted them so bad  
Now 20 years have come and gone  
And I'm still chasing things that I can't have  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yes, I'm still that little girl  
  
Daddy I still haven't slowed down yet

Well I'm married to the good life  
I said I'd be a good wife  
When I put on this ring  
I drive a new Mercedes  
I play tennis with the ladies  
I buy all the finer things  
But all that don't mean nothing  
When you can't get a good night's loving  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh little rock  
Think I'm gonna have to slip you off  
Take a chance tonight and untie the knot  
There's more to life than what I've got  
Oh little rock  
You know this heart of mine just can't be bought  
I'm gonna find someone who really cares a lot  
When I slip off this little rock  
  
Well I wonder if he'll miss me  
He doesn't even kiss me  
When he comes home at night  
He never calls me honey  
But he sure loves his money  
And I'm the one who pays the price  
But when he finds this ring he'll see  
He keeps everything but me  
  
[Chorus: x2]

(Reese Wilson)  
  
I could stop right here turn this car around.  
Walk back through the door put my suitcase down.  
Tell you I'm sorry and things would be alright I know.  
But it all comes down to the lesser of the two.  
Alone by myself or alone with you.  
And if I have to be lonely I'd rather be lonely alone.  
  
CHORUS  
I'd rather miss someone out on this highway.  
Than someone who's sittin' just three feet away.  
And I'd rather be fightin' some old memories,  
than to wonder if you ever really love me.  
  
I could keep going on like I have all along.  
Telling myself that there's nothin' wrong.  
But if I have to be lonely I'd rather be lonely alone.  
  
Repeat CHORUS  
  
I don't know what I'll do, I don't know where I'll go.  
There's a lot I'm not sure of but  
one thing I know. If I have to be lonely,  
I'd rather be lonely alone. If I have to be lonely, I'd  
rather be lonely alone.

(timmy tappan, don roth)  
  
Smile's not a smile until it wrinkles your face  
Bell's not a bell without ringing  
A home's not a home when there's nobody there  
A song's not a song without singing  
  
Chorus:  
Love isn't love till you give it away  
Love isn't love till it's free  
The love in your heart  
Wasn't put there to stay  
Oh love isn't love till you give it away  
  
You might think love is a treasure to keep  
Feeling to cherish and hold  
But love is a treasure for people to share  
You keep it by letting it go  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
Cause love can't survive  
When it's hidden inside  
And love was meant to be shared  
  
Repeat chorus

She was circling the Holiday Inn  
Just about to go 'round again  
When her cell phone rang  
And it was him sayin', "Room 183"  
  
They've never done this before  
But when he met her at the door  
They broke out smiling 'cause they were sure  
That this is what they need  
She said, "Mama's got the kids"  
And he said, "We got the room for the weekend"  
  
They love their kids and their house  
And that dog in the yard  
Oh and their neighbors for the most part  
They love each other but it's hard to be lovers  
When life gets in the way  
Sometimes love needs a holiday  
  
He hung out the 'Do Not Disturb'  
To shut out the rest of the world  
48 hours of just him and her  
You can't get this at home  
  
She pulled the covers back and  
He said, "Yeah I'm in to that"  
They flopped down together and took a nap  
No, you can't get this at home  
They woke up in each other's arms  
And that's where they spent the rest of the weekend  
  
They love their kids and their house  
And that dog in the yard  
Oh and their neighbors for the most part  
They love each other but it's hard to be lovers  
When life gets in the way  
Sometimes love needs a holiday  
  
Room service dinner with candles and wine  
A night with no homework and no baby crying  
They hold each other like they used to do  
He whispers, "Girl, I've missed you"  
  
They love their kids and their house  
And that dog in the yard  
Oh and their neighbors for the most part  
They love each other but it's hard to be lovers  
When life gets in the way  
Sometimes love needs a holiday, needs a holiday  
  
He hung out the 'Do Not Disturb'  
Love needs a holiday  
(Love needs a holiday)  
Just shut out the rest of the world  
Love needs a holiday  
(Love needs a holiday)

Now I know what you need  
And you know what I need  
The whole dang block knows this whole house needs  
A love revival, love revival up in here  
Now I know I'm preaching  
'Cause I'm certainly not leavin'  
But it's time to get excited and the neighbors aren't invited  
To this love revival, love revival up in here  
So sit up and listen boy  
'Cause I'm tired of being nice  
Now Momma's gonna tell you what she needs tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
Revival, Revival  
Well, give me something soulful  
Honey, all I need are your two arms around me again  
So, if you're in this 'till the end  
Then let the love revival begin  
  
I feel the spirit  
The spirit's moving  
I feel the spirit movin'  
  
So I pray you won't deny me  
Now that I've said my peace  
And I'll say it again son  
Just in case you were asleep  
I want a love revival, love revival up in here  
'Cause I know what you need and you know what I need  
This whole dang block knows  
This whole house needs  
A love revival, love revival up in here  
So sit up and listen boy 'cause I'm tired of bein' nice  
Now Momma's gonna tell you what she needs tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well we're both in this till the end  
So let the love revival begin  
I feel the spirit  
The spirit's moving  
I feel the spirit  
The spirit's moving  
I feel the spirit  
The spirit's moving  
I feel the spirit  
The spirit's moving  
  
[Chorus: x2]

I'm loving you baby  
Loving me, Loving you, Loving me  
And I'm inclined just to let it be let it be  
I'm a loving you, loving you, lovin me  
  
Well I'm loving you baby loving you  
Loving you loving me  
And I'm inclined just to let it be, let it be  
I'm a loving you, loving you, loving me  
  
Once was living life alone  
Once was living but the life was gone  
Once my life was just a bad routine  
When you're doing it by yourself life's such a lonely thing  
  
I'm loving you baby  
Loving me, Loving you, Loving me  
And I'm inclined just to let it be let it be  
I'm a loving you, loving you, lovin me  
  
I'm loving you baby  
Loving me, Loving you, Loving me  
And I'm inclined just to let it be let it be  
I'm a loving you, loving you, lovin me  
  
I'm loving you baby  
Loving me, Loving you, Loving me  
And I'm inclined just to let it be let it be  
I'm a loving you, loving you, lovin me

Verse 1  
Mama stood on the front porch ringin' her hands  
Watched the tail lights fadin' on his black tranzam  
With her precious little baby taking off inside  
Staring at him with stars in her eyes  
She tried to tell her but the girl might as well have been deaf  
She wasn't gonna listen to a word she said  
Chorus  
Don't go down Maggie Creek Road  
With a boy lookin' like that  
He'll tell ya thangs that you wanna hear  
And they'll be no turnin' back  
There's an oak tree down by the lake  
In the shade where the wild flowers grow  
What'll happen only heaven knows  
So don't go down Maggie Creek Road  
(at the end)........don't go down....... Maggie Creek Road)  
Verse 2  
Was a still black night as dark is cold  
Nobody heard her when she said no  
She kicked and screamed and got free somehow  
Tore her dress on the door when he pushed her out  
She walked 13 miles on the gravel road  
With tears in her eyes 20 years ago  
chorus  
Verse 3  
Somehow mama's always know  
Cause they shoulda been home an hour ago  
When she pulled up it was just going down  
She turned her headlights off didn't make a sound  
She heard her baby crying no but he wouldn't stop  
Her heart went cold and her blood ran hot  
With a pistol in her hand she opened his door  
You don't wanna see mama go to war  
chorus  

Open up your arms to me  
Come and hold me tenderly  
Let me know your love for me is real  
And love me like there's no tomorrow  
Share my joys and share my sorrow  
Make me feel like a woman wants to feel  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
I know you love me cause you told me so  
But that ain't enough cause I want to be shown  
Make me feel like a woman wants to feel  
And let me know you miss me when I'm not around  
Go ahead and kiss me when I'm feeling down  
Make me feel like a woman wants to feel  
  
Love me like I want to be loved  
Let me know I'm the one you dream of  
Make me feel like a woman wants to feel  
Make me feel like a woman wants to feel

Mary, did you know  
That your baby boy will one day walk on water?  
Mary, Did you know  
That your baby boy will save our sons and daughters?  
Did you know  
That your baby boy has come to make you new?  
This child that you've delivered  
Will soon deliver you  
  
Mary, did you know  
That your baby boy will give sight to a blind man?  
Mary, did you know  
That your baby boy will calm a storm with His hand?  
Did you know  
That your baby boy has walked where angels trod?  
And when you kiss your little baby  
You've kissed the face of God  
  
Mary, did you know?  
The blind will see  
The deaf will hear  
And the dead will live again  
The lame will leap  
The dumb will speak  
The praises of the Lamb  
  
Mary, did you know  
That your baby boy is Lord of all creation?  
Mary, Did you know  
That your baby boy will one day rule the nations?  
Did you know  
That your baby boy is heaven's perfect Lamb?  
This sleeping child you're holding  
Is the Great I am

Oh it's been such a long long time  
Looks like I kept you off my mind  
But I can't  
Just the thought of you  
Turns my whole world a misty blue  
  
Just the mention of your name  
Turns a flicker to a flame  
I think of things we used to do  
Then my whole world turns misty blue  
  
I should forget you  
Heaven knows I've tried  
But when I say I'm glad we're through  
My heart knows that I've lied  
  
Oh it's been such a long long time  
Looks like I kept you off my mind  
But I can't  
Just the thought of you  
Turns my whole world a misty blue  
  
I should forget you  
Heaven knows I've tried  
But when I say I'm glad we're through  
My heart knows that I've lied  
  
Oh it's been such a long long time  
Looks like I kept you off my mind  
But I can't  
Just the thought of you  
Turns my whole world a misty blue  
  
Oh but I can't  
Just the thought of you  
Turns my whole world a misty blue

Moving Oleta was the hardest thing he'd done  
The nurses saw an old woman cryin'  
But he saw the love of his life  
She don't know where she is  
But she knows this isn't home  
Love is a hard, hard road  
  
He met her in the summer of '37  
in a brush arbor down on the Rush Creek shore  
He loved her black hair and the mischief in her smile  
But she won him with her eyes  
  
All the years and children gone,  
he still sees her the same  
Love is a hard, hard road  
  
He woke up each morning and drove into town  
He stayed all day till her dinner came  
Then he took her to a room, leaned on her wheelchair like a walker  
Covered her with a quilt she'd made  
Only God and a couple of nurses helped the old man shoulder the load  
Love is a hard, hard road  
  
He said "They tell me this is all that's left,  
Say this hell on Earth is best,  
I lost all those reasons and I still don't understand"  
He cursed his body old and weak  
Tears of failure burned his cheeks  
He said "Oh, don't you know I prayed to die before this day"  
Love is a hard, hard road  
  
There's a shadow much darker than the valley of death  
When you fear the reaper night not come today  
The line 'em up in Laz-E-Boys out in the sunroom  
The TV keeps the quiet away  
She can't recall his name and she's the only love he's known  
Love is a hard, hard road  
Love is a hard, hard road  
Moving Oleta was the hardest thing he'd done.

[Chorus]  
I can hardly see my face in the waters of the muddy Mississippi  
But I can see the shadows of the cotton wood standing over me  
The morning sun would find me  
Swinging from the rope that's hanging free  
And I drop in to the waters  
And go swimming in the muddy Mississippi  
  
A boy came to the Delta  
And we would swing together from that tree  
I could see my dreams in his eyes  
As he held on to me  
  
Swinging in the sunlight  
Loving in the shadows  
Wild and free  
And I made him promise he would take me  
Down to New Orleans  
  
Bright lights of the city made my red dress and shoes look brand new  
While he worked the night shift  
I turned on and I turned loose  
I lost my pride I lost my man  
I did things a girl like me shouldn't do  
  
Now I can't face this living  
With the swelling signs of new life  
Showing through  
  
I can hardly see my face in the waters of the muddy Mississippi  
But I can see the shadows of the cotton wood standing over me  
The morning sun would find me  
Hanging from the rope that's swinging free  
And I'll swing for the last time over the waters  
Of the muddy Mississippi  
  
Yeah the muddy Mississippi

Hey girl, it's me, just called to tell you hi  
Call me when you get this  
Haven't talked lately, so hard to find the time  
Give the boys a big kiss  
Tell them that I miss them  
By the way, I miss you too  
I was thinking just today  
About how we used to play  
Barbie dolls and makeup  
Tea Parties, dress up  
I remember how we'd fight  
And make up and laugh all night  
Wish we were kids again  
My sister, my friend  
  
Oh yeah before I forget I met someone  
I think I really like him  
I was just wondering if I'm jumping the gun  
By going out on a limb  
And invite him home for Christmas  
To meet the family  
Seems like just yesterday,  
You brought home oh what's his name  
He had been drinking, what were you thinking?  
After dinner he passed out,  
We can laugh about it now  
'Cause we've learned a lot since then  
My sister, my friend  
  
Do you think you could come and  
See me sometime soon? (see me sometime soon)  
We could just hang out like we used to  
  
It's late and I should go,  
But I can't hang up the phone  
Until I tell you what I don't tell you enough  
Even though at times it seemed  
We were more like enemies  
I'd do it all again  
My sister, my friend  
  
Oh, my sister, my friend.

Turn out the light  
Turn yourself over to me  
Turn off the world  
Turn my feelings free  
  
Just enjoy the pleasure  
For the pleasure pleases me  
You've been turning me on all night long  
Now it's my turn  
  
You have reached the woman in me  
Through the man in you  
Let me be that woman  
Before the lovin's through  
  
You just turn yourself over to me  
While I turn my feelings free  
You've been turning me on all night long  
Now it's my turn  
  
All night long  
I've been driven to your touch  
Haven't had time to give  
I've been taking so much  
  
I know you want to hold me  
But darling you've done enough  
You've been turning me on all night long  
Now it's my turn  
  
You have reached the woman in me  
Through the man in you  
Let me be that woman  
Before the lovin's through  
  
You just turn yourself over to me  
While I turn my feelings free  
You've been turning me on all night long  
Now it's my turn  
  
All night long  
I've been driven to your touch  
Haven't had time to give  
I've been taking so much

When you walked out that door  
I was so sure my world had ended  
So sure I'd never get over you  
  
On that first night alone  
I cried so many tears it scared me  
So many dreams that I had to let go  
But now I know  
  
That the world still turns and the sun still burns  
And that's what I've learned without you  
And the days roll on and my heart gets stronger too  
Don't think I didn't love you  
Just because I made it through  
But I learned to love myself  
Without you  
  
I take myself to dinner  
And I go to the movies solo  
That's something I never did before  
  
You may not understand this  
But I don't' wait on invitations  
I'm not afraid of the great unknown  
Of being alone cause the  
  
The world still turns and the sun still burns  
And that's what I've learned without you  
And the days roll on and my heart gets stronger too  
Don't think I didn't love you  
Just because I made it through  
But I learned to love myself  
Without you  
  
I can even see myself  
Falling in love with somebody else  
Ready to take that chance again  
Cause I know now  
What I didn't know then  
  
That the world still turns and the sun still burns  
And that's what I've learned without you  
And the days roll on and my heart gets stronger too  
Don't think I didn't love you  
Just because I made it through  
But I learned to love myself  
Without you

All the girls I grew up with  
Got a husband house and kids  
That's what everybody did after school  
If I'd a had a steady boyfriend  
I mighta stuck around like them but  
Back then I never had a reason to  
L.A.'s like another planet  
Had to live there to understand it  
And I thought when I first landed that California's cool  
Till I saw good girls gettin' outta control  
Endin' up sellin' their souls  
Oh no I never had a reason to  
I never had a reason to stay  
To not walk away  
Nobody's heart was gonna break over me  
I never had somethin' worth keepin'  
Or somebody I needed  
Like I'm needin' you  
Baby don't you see it's true  
I never had a reason to believe in love  
To some love comes as a vision  
To some it's a sweet baptism  
Me and love had a head-on collision  
When I ran into you  
Got some feelings I'm figurin' out  
No I don't know exactly how  
Until now I never had a reason to  

Well there's news flying 'round  
On the rosy side of town  
That I have gone and found somebody new  
Well ?  
Against the way some people talk  
I guess sometimes it's all they have to do  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh there ain't no such thing  
As me not loving you  
Honey there ain't no such thing  
As me not being true  
So believe your heart and not your ears  
Your heart knows what is true  
There's no such thing  
As me not loving you  
  
Well a love like yours and mine  
Has got to deal with the jealous kind  
But I don't mind there's nothing I can do  
Cause their words can do no harm  
With you here in my arms  
So they can talk until their talk turn blue  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(There ain't no such thing as me not loving you)

Well, I'm sitting on the bus  
Rolling down through Georgia  
Don't know where I'm going  
And I don't care what's new  
I've got nothing to lose  
  
Well, I've had no sleep  
Going on three days  
Smoked my last cigarette  
Somewhere near Atlanta  
It's true, I've got nothing to lose  
  
Nothing to lose since I've lost you  
Feeling all alone  
Used to have it all and now my heart is gone  
It's true, I've got nothing to lose  
  
Well, we're coming up on Macon  
Gonna rest here a spell  
Making idle conversation  
With a stranger without you  
I've got nothing to lose  
  
Nothing to lose since I've lost you  
Feeling all alone  
Used to have it all and now my heart is gone  
It's true, I've got nothing to lose  
  
Ooh, nothing to lose  
Ooh, since I lost you  
  
You left me with no worry  
You left with no cares  
And you took my whole life with you  
And you left me standing there  
It's true, I've got nothing to lose  
  
Nothing to lose since I've lost you  
Feeling all alone  
Used to have it all and now my heart is gone  
It's true, I've got nothing to lose  
  
Yes, it's true  
I've got nothing to lose  
  
I've got nothing, nothing left to lose  
I've got nothing, nothing left to lose  
I've got nothing, nothing left to lose  
I've got nothing, nothing left to lose  
  
Nothing left to lose

(jerry fuller)  
  
I see you now, I think of then  
And dwell upon the happiness of way back when  
Cause since you said goodbye  
The feelings just won't die  
And I still long to hold you now and then  
  
A million years have come and gone  
And I was sure by now I'd make it on my own  
But seeing you today  
Took my breath away  
And I still long to hold you now and then  
  
Suddenly I felt myself wondering  
If you might wanna try it again  
And though I wanted so much to hold you  
You smiled and shook my hand  
  
So i'll exist on dreams again  
On days when we were lovers and not just friends  
And even if I find another love in time  
I still long to hold you now and then  
  
Oh, I still long to hold you now and then

Oh holy night!  
The stars are brightly shining  
It is the night of the dear Savior's birth  
Long lay the world in sin and error pining  
Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth.  
The thrill of hope the weary soul rejoices  
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn  
  
Fall on your knees  
Oh hear the angel's voices  
Oh night divine  
Oh holy night when Christ was born  
Oh night divine  
Oh holy night when Christ was born  
  
Led by the light a face serenely beaming  
With glowing heart by His cradle we stand  
So led by light of the star so sweetly beaming  
Here came the wise men from far different lands  
A King of Kings is born the world rejoices  
In all our trials born to be our friend.  
  
Fall on your knees  
Oh hear the angel's voices  
Oh night divine  
Oh holy night when Christ was born  
Oh night  
Oh holy night when Christ was born

(ronny scaife, danny hogan)  
  
Cool breeze on the river  
Ripples to the shore  
Wash away my troubles  
To the sea forever more  
Wind and willows whisper  
Sadness is the sound  
Tell the tale of my wants  
Happy world that's falling down  
Old man I might be going where you're bound  
  
Chorus:  
Old man river  
I've come to talk again  
Yes I know you're tired  
Cause your journey never ends  
Hes just like you  
Hes moving all the time  
And I think he's moving me out of his mind  
  
I want to travel with you  
In your deep and nimble soul  
That's the only way to make it  
Peaceful like before  
  
We used to touch at midnight  
But now I feel he's gone  
Even though he's lying next to me I feel alone  
Oh man it looks like I'm to travel alone  
  
Repeat chorus x2

So many times I said it was forever  
Said our love would always be true  
Somethin' in my heart always knew  
I'd be lying there beside him  
  
On my own, On my own, On my own  
  
So many promises never should be spoken  
Now you know what loving him costs  
Now you're even talking divorce  
And you weren't even married  
  
On my own  
Once again I'm  
One more time by myself  
  
No one said it would be easy  
But it once was so easy  
Well I believe in love now here I stand  
You wonder why  
  
I'm on my own  
Why did it end this way  
On my own  
This wasn't how it was supposed to be  
On my own  
I wish that we could do it all again  
  
So many times I know I could have told you  
That losing him would cut like a knife  
He walked out and there went your life  
I don't want to live without him  
  
On my own  
This wasn't how it was supposed to end  
On my own  
I wish that we could do it all again  
On my own  
I never dreamed I'd spend one night alone by myself  
On my own  
You've got to find out where you belong again  
On my own  
You've got to learn how to be strong again  
On my own  
I never dreamed I'd spend one night alone by myself  
  
You've got to find out where you belong again  
Your heart is saying that it's time again  
And I know that you're gonna shine again

Three wise men, a shining star  
A mother and a father who had come so far  
How could they know about their son  
And the miracle he'd become  
That he held the soul of man  
In his tiny little hands  
  
[Chorus]  
One child one day  
And the universe will never be the same  
From Bethlehem  
Cause the angels' voices rejoicing in his name  
Oh, and I believe with all my heart  
That he will show the way  
And you and I will meet  
One child one day  
  
A small white church, a mountainside  
Cathedrals filled with music, and golden light  
Oh, we gather everywhere  
For the peace that's always there  
For the story that is told  
Of a birth so long ago  
  
[Chorus]

I would have waited forever  
If I'd known that you'd be here  
We could have shared our lives together  
And held each other close all through the years  
But I've met someone before you  
And my heart just couldn't wait  
So no matter how much I adore you  
I've got to stand behind the promise that I made  
  
[Chorus]  
Where were you  
When I could have loved you  
Where were you  
When I gave my heart away  
All my life I've been dreaming of you  
You came along one promise too late  
You came along one promise too late  
  
I won't say that I'm sorry that I met you  
I can't have you but I never will forget you  
  
[Chorus: x2]

Your mind's made up  
You're gonna leave  
Nothing I can say will stop you so it seems  
But before you up and go  
There's just something you should know  
When you find that I'm the one you still need  
  
[Chorus]  
One thin dime  
Is all it takes  
When you need someone who cares  
These arms of mine  
Are always open  
One thin dime is all you need  
And I'll be there  
  
Oh you're chasing rainbows and I understand  
When you're through I'll take you back again  
I'll be waiting patiently  
For when you come back to me  
Ain't nobody else can love you like I can  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You know the number  
I'm always home  
So honey just pick up and dial that telephone  
When this world treats you unkind  
Get your momma on the line  
There ain't no need for you to ever be alone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
These arms of mine  
Oh they're always open  
One thin dime is all you need  
And I'll be there
