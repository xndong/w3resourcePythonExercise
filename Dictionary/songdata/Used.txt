Maybe light a candle  
Don't say a prayer for me  
Feel alone  
'cause I'm gone  
I left you  
Make Christmas your own  
  
You throw the thought of us away  
You'll be alone this holiday  
  
Said, It's cold in this town  
And there's snow on the ground  
Far from home  
Not alone  
I left you with nothing  
And that's what you own  
  
You throw the thought of us away  
You'll be alone this holiday  
  
Maybe light a candle  
Don't say a prayer for me  
Feel alone  
'cause I'm gone  
I left you the best time  
Make Christmas your own  
  
You throw the thought of us away  
You'll be alone this holiday

You felt the coldness in my eyes  
And it's something I'm not revealing  
Though you got used to my disguise  
You can't shake this awful feeling  
  
It's the me that I let you know  
'Cause I'll never show I have my reasons  
I hate to say that I told you so  
But I told you so, yeah  
  
There's blood on my hands  
Like the blood in you  
Some things can't be treated  
So don't make me, don't make me be myself around you  
  
Straight from your eyes it's burying me  
Beautifully so disfigured  
This other side that you can't see  
Just praying you won't remember  
  
Feel the pain that I never show  
And I hope you know, it's never healing  
I hate to say that I told you so  
But I told you so, yeah  
  
There's blood on my hands  
Like the blood in you  
Some things can't be treated  
So don't make me, don't make me be myself around you  
  
Straight from your eyes it's burying me  
Beautifully so disfigured  
This other side that you can't see  
Just praying you won't remember  
  
There's blood, there's blood  
There's blood, blood, blood  
  
There's blood on my hands  
Like the blood in you  
Some things can't be treated  
So don't make me, don't make me be myself around you  
  
There's blood on my hands  
(There's blood)  
Like the blood in you  
(There's blood)  
  
Some things can't be treated  
(There's blood)  
So don't make me, don't make me be myself around you  
  
There's blood

And it's all in how you mix the two  
And it starts just where the light exists  
It's a feeling that you cannot miss  
And it burns a hole  
Through everyone that feels it  
  
Well your never gonna find it  
If your looking for it  
Won't come your way  
Well you'll never find it  
If your looking for it  
  
Should've done something but I've done it enough  
By the way your hands were shaking  
Rather waste some time with you  
  
And you never would have though in the end  
How amazing it feels just to live again  
It's a feeling that you cannot miss  
It burns a hole through everyone that feels it  
  
Should've said something but I've said it enough  
By the way my words were faded  
Rather waste some time with you

From the way that you acted  
To the way that I felt it  
It wasn't worth my time  
And now it's sad cause all I missed  
Wasn't that good to begin with  
And now I've started you begging  
Saying things that you don't mean  
It isn't worth my time  
A line's a dime a million times  
And I'm about to see all of them  
  
Goodbye to you  
You're taking up my time  
  
You call my name when I wake up  
To see things go your way  
I'm coughing up my time  
Each drag's a drop of blood a grain  
A minute of my life  
It's all I've got just to stay down  
Why the fuck am I still down  
I'm hoarding all that's mine  
Each time I let just one slip by  
I'm wasting what is mine  
  
I'm about to see a million things  
I thought I'd never see before and I  
I'm about to do all the things I've dreamed of  
And I don't even miss you at all

This feeling never leaves you alone  
You pull the trigger on your own  
You're hiding in your safe place  
Hiding with your eyes shut tightly  
On the way to the hospital  
  
Not will you ever rest your head  
You end up feeling mostly dead  
Pretending you're the last one  
Hiding with your eyes shut tightly  
On the way to the hospital  
  
Before I cross my heart and hope to die at all  
I take off my mask  
And leave the lies to the liars  
  
It never used to hurt before  
It isn't funny anymore  
You're feeling so alone now  
Funny how you wish some way that you could die at the hospital  
  
You're quiet on the car ride home  
You're waiting for your head to explode  
You're hiding in your safe place  
Hiding with your eyes shut tightly  
All the way to the hospital  
  
Before I cross my heart and hope to die at all  
I take off my mask  
And leave the lies to the liars  
(Before I close my)  
Before I close my eyes  
I hope to give it up  
(Take off my)  
I take off my mask  
And leave the lies to the liars  
And leave the lies to the liars  
  
He thinks he fooled them all  
(Hip hip hooray, hip hip hooray)  
He thinks he fooled them all  
(Hip hip hooray, hip hip hooray)  
(Hip hip hooray, hip hip hooray)  
  
Before I cross my heart and hope to die at all  
I take off my mask  
And leave the lies to the liars  
(Before I close my)  
Before I close my eyes  
I'm gonna give it up  
(Take off my mask)  
I take off my mask  
And leave the lies to the liars  
Leave the lies to the liars  
Hey, hey, hey  
Hey, hey, hey  
Leave the lies to the liars  
Hey, hey, hey  
Hey, hey, hey  
Leave the lies to the liars  
Hey, hey, hey

I never meant to hurt no one  
Nobody ever tore me down like you  
I think you knew it all along  
And now you'll never see my face again  
I never meant to hurt nobody  
And will I ever see the sun again?  
I wonder where the guilt had gone  
I think of what I have become  
And still  
I never meant to hurt nobody  
Now I'm taking what is mine  
  
Letting go of my mistakes  
Build a fire from what I've learned  
And watch it fade away  
Because I have no heart to break  
I cannot fake it like before  
I thought that I could stay the same  
And now I know that I'm not sure  
I even love me anymore  
  
I never meant to hurt no one  
Sometimes you gotta look the other way  
It never should've lasted so long  
Ashamed you'll never see my face again  
I never meant to hurt nobody  
I know I'll never be the same again  
Now taking back what I have done  
I think of what I have become  
And still  
I never meant to hurt nobody  
Now I'm taking what is mine  
  
Letting go of my mistakes  
Build a fire from what I've learned  
And watch it fade away  
Because I have no heart to break  
I cannot fake it like before  
I thought that I could stay the same  
And now I know that I'm not sure  
I even love me anymore  
  
I never meant to hurt nobody  
Nobody ever tore me down like you  
I never meant to hurt no one  
Now I'm taking what is mine  
  
Letting go of my mistakes

And watch it fade away  
Because I have no heart to break

And now I know that I'm not sure  
I even love me anymore

I'll take one for the money  
'Cause I've already paid  
I'll take two for the lover  
of the shifting plates  
I'll take three for South America  
It's snorting in gaunwana  
I'll be up down under  
When they killed Captain America  
  
Okay I'm back I'll take the  
Hanging upside down the crucifix  
Alright I lied I wanna follow  
Proud that you cut yourself  
Feeling Feeling hahahahaha  
  
What can I say for the little biddy baby  
Who raised the price throwing things that there's a pig in the bed  
Big brother coming on me like a sledgehammer  
Why stand beside me, just play dead  
  
One twenty hear the tick, this is where we begin  
Two twenty, twenty seven people who actually can  
Overdosed on the experience  
And paid for the delivery  
Feel like crying, Jesus fucked you like a prostitute, baby  
Sorry Muhamed was a racist prick  
Boy, that Gaea was a cunty bitch  
Gianna blowing out the bottle  
Fall, I bet you cut yourself, I bet you cut yourself  
  
What can I say for the little biddy baby  
Who raised the price throwing things that there's a pig in the bed  
Big brother coming on me like a sledgehammer  
Why stand beside me, just play dead  
Don't be caught thoughtless, it's in your head  
  
And for the day confined to fast and fires  
But this, internal blaze it must not be  
Mark me, I will  
My hour has always come  
Thy nodded and combined locks with part  
I am thy fathers spirit  
When I to sulferous and tormenting flames  
  
What can I say for the little biddy baby  
Who raised the price throwing things that there's a pig in the bed  
Now I can't recall, it almost tips over  
Why stand beside me, just play  
  
What can I say for the little biddy baby  
What can I say for the little biddy baby  
What can I say for the little biddy baby  
Why stand beside me, just play dead

Small, simple, safe price.  
Rise the wake and carry me with all of my regrets.  
This is not a small cut that scabs, and dries, and flakes, and heals.  
And I am not afraid to die.  
I'm not afraid to bleed, and fuck, and fight.  
I want the pain of payment.  
What's left, but a section of pigmy size cuts.  
Much like a slew of a thousand unwanted fucks.  
Would you be my little cut?  
Would you be my thousand fucks?  
And make mark leaving space for the guilt to be liquid.  
To fill, and spill over, and under my thoughts.  
My sad, sorry, selfish cry out to the cutter.  
I'm cutting trying to picture your black broken heart.  
Love is not like anything.  
Especially a fucking knife.  
  
Look at me, you can tell.  
By the way I move and do my hair.  
Do you think that it's me?  
Or it's not me I don't even care.  
I'm alive, I smell  
I'm the cleanest I have ever been.  
I feel big, I feel tall, I feel dry  
Dry!  
  
Just look at me.  
Look at me now.  
(I'm a fake, I'm a fake, I'm a fake, I'm a fake).  
Just look at me.  
Look at me now.  
(I'm a fake, I'm a fake, I'm a fake, I'm a fake).  
  
Do I drink? Do I date?  
I got perfect placements all my inks  
Satisfied in your eyes  
I'm the biggest fan I got right now  
I made sure I looked how I wanted to look  
The people around me, the people surround me  
I feel big, I feel tall, I feel dry  
Dry!  
  
Just look at me.  
Look at me now.  
(I'm a fake, I'm a fake, I'm a fake, I'm a fake).  
Just look at me.  
Look at me now.  
(I'm a fake, I'm a fake, I'm a fake, I'm a fake).

I wasn't made to understand.  
I've given up my name, forgotten where I stand.  
Sometimes I don't know who I am. I used to feel so scared,  
I used to hold your hand.  
I'm so sick of playing favorites, sick of being scared.  
  
They would rather see you all alone.  
Imaginary enemy!  
We are much less different than we know.  
Imaginary enemy, imaginary enemy!  
I would never leave you all alone.  
Imaginary enemy! (Ha!)  
  
I will not ever understand.  
Just how it got this way, and how it got so bad.  
You're not a part of what we need. There is no common ground.  
We hate what you believe.  
I'm so sick of playing favorites, sick of being scared.  
  
They would rather see you all alone.  
Imaginary enemy!  
We are much less different than we know.  
Imaginary enemy, imaginary enemy!  
I would never leave you all alone.  
Imaginary enemy!  
  
Who taught me to hate you, when I don't even know you?  
Who created the enemy?  
Who taught me to hate you, when I don't even know you?  
Who taught me to hate you, hate you, hate you!  
  
Who created the enemy!?  
  
Who created!?  
  
They would rather see you all alone.  
Imaginary enemy!  
We are much less different than we know.  
Imaginary enemy, imaginary enemy!  
I would never leave you all alone.  
Imaginary enemy!  
  
Who created the enemy!?  
  
Who created!?

Kenna song  
Shine a light on what we think  
Kenna song  
Move the people to their feet  
Kenna song  
Leave us brave enough to fight  
Kenna song  
Give us strength to do what's right  
  
We have the right to let our voices be heard  
  
Hear us now, hear us screaming out  
Feel it breaking down, bet you can hear us now  
No more secrets, no more fear  
Can you hear us now? Bet you can hear us now  
  
Sing a song  
Change a world that doesn't care  
Sing a song  
Stop the only ones who dare  
Sing a song  
See the ones who need it more  
Sing a song  
Bring the soldiers back from war  
We have the right to let our voices be heard  
  
Hear us now, hear us screaming out  
Feel it breaking down, bet you can hear us now  
No more secrets, no more fear  
Can you hear us now? Bet you can hear us now  
  
We stand together set in stone, hearts open wide  
And leave them no place left to hide  
It's not a bridge, it's their ideas we must burn  
You had your chance now it's our turn  
  
Hear us now, hear us screaming out  
Feel it breaking down, bet you can hear us now  
No more secrets, no more fear  
Can you hear us now? Bet you can hear us now  
  
Hear us now, hear us screaming out  
Feel it breaking down, bet you can hear us now  
No more secrets, no more fear  
Can you hear us now? Bet you can hear us now

Cut yourself in conversation  
Cut the line to make me feel alive  
'Cause you know I'm not alive  
  
And leave me with your complications  
Take your life, you feel like taking mine  
Meeting god we stand in line, not alone  
  
Nowhere to go, I'm not leaving  
Not going, I'm not kissing you goodbye  
On my own, I'm nothing  
Just bleeding, I'm not kissing you goodbye  
  
Trust you'll take the right to leave me  
Waiting under dark clouds for the rain  
Praying lightning strikes a change  
As history gets lost and  
As I took that final breath I felt alive  
Meeting god to stand in line, all alone  
  
Nowhere to go, I'm not leaving  
Not going, I'm not kissing you goodbye

This poison's my intoxication  
I broke a needle off in my skin  
Pick the scabs and pick the bleeding  
And assume that it was all in vein  
Popping a scab that's never healing  
It just hit me in the face  
Burning bridges, So misleading  
The poison's more important now with the pain  
  
Let it bleed  
Take the red for what it's worth whoa  
Watch the fire  
Fill your lungs with smoke for the last time  
If you feel like dying you might want to sing  
  
The fire department couldn't drown the city  
They didn't even try to wash it clean  
And what did you think that I was sober?  
For me yea cause I'm on fucking fire  
Popping a scab that's never healing  
I'm proud that I kept this clean  
The most that I can do for you is keep on lying  
I'm tired of lying I think I'd rather sin  
  
Let it bleed  
  
Take the red for what it's worth woah  
Watch the fire  
Fill your lungs with smoke for the last time  
If you feel like dying you might want to sing!  
  
Oh oh you might want to sing  
Aha ha you might want to sing  
Ha ha you might want to sing  
Ha ha ha ha sing!  
You might want to sing!  
You might want to sing!  
You might want to sing or scream at  
  
This poison's my intoxication  
I broke a needle off in my skin  
Pick the scabs and pick the bleeding  
And yeah, assume that it was all in vein  
  
Let it bleed  
Take the red for what it's worth, whoa  
Watch the fire  
I'ma fill your lungs with smoke for the last time  
If you feel like dying  
If you feel like dying  
If you feel like dying, You might want to sing  
Ha ha ha You might want to sing  
Ha ha You might want to sing

Your skin attached is a fragile cliche  
Of my broken heart attack  
You should swallow your teeth and hang out  
Stay for a while  
If your heart's still beating, it must be blood  
If your lungs's still working, it must be mud  
If its still light, then a kick in the ribs  
Today's worth living?  
  
I don't see anything now  
So just say what you want to say  
It's kind of funny how you're not listening anyway  
  
Lights out, I can't stand to hear you scream while  
We're making love, I was fast asleep  
And the night sky better give something up  
  
I don't see anything now  
So just say what you want to say  
It's kind of funny how I'm not listening anyway  
  
Lights out  
Lights out, I can't stand to hear you scream while  
We're making love, I was fast a sleep  
  
If your heart's still beating, it must be blood  
If your lung's still working, it must be mud  
If its still light out, then a kick in the ribs  
Today's worth living? Then it probably is..  
  
I don't see anything now  
So just say what you want to say  
It's kind of funny how I'm not listening anyway  
I don't see anything now  
So just say what you want to say  
It's kind of funny how I'm not listening anyway  
I'm not listening anyway  
I'm not listening anyway  
I'm not listening  
  
Listening, I'm not listening  
I'm not listening  
I'm not listening  
I'm not listening

Wake up  
My love  
Never thought you'd make me, break me  
Now I'm up from below  
Such a brilliant star you are  
And will your love keep burning baby  
Burn a hole right through my eyes  
All these short times feel like no time  
I thought you ought to know  
I'm so far gone now I been running on empty  
I'm so far gone now  
Do you want to take me on?  
  
Do, Do you, Do you know?  
Do you know how long I've waited?  
To look up from below,  
Just to find someone like you?  
And will your love like burn me, baby?  
Burn a hole right through my heart  
I think I might just trust you, maybe  
But I'm not sure  
I'm not sure I want to know  
  
I'm so far gone now I been running on empty  
I'm so far gone now  
Do you want to take me on?  
  
Whoa Whoa Whoa Whoa

Could make me take my life  
I know you can break me girl  
Take all of me  
All of me, yeah hey  
  
Wake up  
My love  
Never thought you'd make me, break me  
Now I'm up from below  
Such a brilliant star you are

Past midnight,  
Breathing in the dark.  
Same strange friend comes to visit  
Never intend to open the door.  
  
You take it to places that no one's ever been,  
You let it,  
You let it.  
Your insides caving in.  
You pushed and pulled, still wanting some more.  
  
This time I've gone all the way,  
Without you.  
There's nothing more I can say.  
  
So maybe I took a little too much.  
Maybe life didn't want this part of me.  
It it helps to know,  
I never let you go.  
Sure, I lost my mind.  
But I never really meant to die.  
  
Last heartbeat's fading in the night,  
Only expected darkness.  
Surprised to wake and follow the light  
  
The second you let it become a part of you,  
You'll never forget it, no matter what you do.  
You lost it all, still wanting some more.  
  
This time I've gone all the way,  
Without you.  
There's nothing more I can say.  
  
So maybe I took a little too much.  
Maybe life didn't want this part of me.  
It it helps to know,  
I never let you go.  
I'm sorry that I lost my mind.  
  
So baby, I took a little too much.  
Maybe you sucked the life right out of me.  
I should have let you know,  
I never meant to go.  
Sure I lost my mind,  
But I never really meant to die.  
  
Never stay forever.  
Never stay forever.  
Come on.  
  
Never stay forever.  
Never stay forever.  
Come on.  
  
So maybe I took a little too much.  
Maybe life didn't want this part of me.  
If it helps to know,  
I never let you go.  
I'm sorry that I lost my mind.  
  
So baby, I took a little too much.  
Maybe you sucked the life right out of me.  
I should have let you know,  
I never meant to go.  
Sure I lost my mind, but I never really meant to die.

Always safe to know, what is good for taking  
Blood stains from your clothes  
(Besides fire)  
Like I said before  
When I bite your tongue, out of your mouth, you'll know  
(You'll know)  
  
Just what am I supposed to say?  
And tell you why I turned out this way?  
Don't make me, don't make me  
  
If you love it, then let it go  
And how I thought you'll never know  
Just don't blame me, don't blame me  
  
You'll never make it alone  
(It's easier to know)  
You've always been on your own  
(It's easier to know)  
  
Nothing safe feels real  
Waiting here to dodge, so open I reveal  
(There's something)  
  
Picking up my Brains  
You can tell your mom that men are all the same  
(The same)  
Just what am I supposed to say?  
And tell you why I turned out this way?  
Don't make me, don't make me  
  
If you love it, then let it go  
And how I thought you'll never know  
Just don't blame me, don't blame me  
  
You'll never make it alone  
(It's easier to know)  
You've always been on your own  
(It's easier to know)  
You'll have to pay to watch me jump  
That I love you more  
You'll never make it alone  
It's easier to go  
It's easier to go  
  
Nowhere to go, I'm not leaving  
Not going, I'm not kissing you goodbye on my own  
I'm nothing, just bleeding  
I'm not kissing you goodbye  
  
You'll never make it alone  
(Let it go, I'm not leaving)  
You've always been on your own  
(Not going, I'm not kissing you goodbye)  
You'll never make it alone  
(On my own, I'm nothing, just bleeding)  
You've always been on your own  
(I'm not kissing you goodbye)  
  
You'll never make it alone  
(Let it go, I'm not leaving)  
You've always been on your own  
(Not going, I'm not kissing you goodbye)  
You'll never make it alone  
(On my own, I'm nothing, just bleeding)  
You've always been on your own  
(I'm not kissing you goodbye)

"I began to spoke, my brain's holding the grip of a giant vice  
It was all very good  
Floating higher and higher, a wonderful feeling"  
  
Die! Die! Die!  
  
I'm watching closely just to see  
So I can rest in peace  
I put my face close, make sure you're not breathing  
You look so nice, so pretty dress  
You're painted skin can say the rest  
Until they bury you, I won't believe it  
  
Breathing! Not breathing! Breathing! Not breathing!  
  
How can it feel so right when it's so right?  
Now that you're dead, it's gonna turn me on  
You're not like Jesus Christ, you're just gone  
Now that you're dead, it's gonna turn me on  
  
Breathing! Not breathing! Breathing!  
  
I see that nothing in your eyes  
Could turn me cold as ice  
I steal a kiss to make sure you're not breathing  
We picked you out a pretty cage  
Scribbled some bullshit on the grave  
Until they bury you I won't believe it  
  
Breathing! Not breathing! Breathing! Not breathing!  
  
How can it feel so right when it's so right?  
Now that you're dead, it's gonna turn me on  
You're not like Jesus Christ, you're just gone  
Now that you're dead, it's gonna turn me on  
  
Life, as precious as it is, I've waited for this day  
I've waited for your death, for you to fade away  
As precious as it is, I've waited for this day  
I've waited for your death, for you to fade away  
As precious as it is, I've waited for this day  
I've waited for your death, for you to fade away  
As precious as it is, I've waited for this day  
I've waited for your death, for you to fade away  
  
How can it feel so right when it's so right?  
Now that you're dead, it's gonna turn me on  
You're not like Jesus Christ, you're just gone  
Now that you're dead, it's gonna turn me on  
  
How can it feel so right when it's so right?  
Now that you're dead, it's gonna turn me on  
You're not like Jesus Christ, you're just gone  
Now that you're dead, it's gonna turn me on

See all those people on the ground  
Wasting time  
I try to hold it all inside  
But just for tonight  
The top of the world  
Sitting here wishing  
The things I've become  
That something is missing  
Maybe I,  
But what do I know  
  
And now it seems that I have found  
Nothing at all  
I want to hear your voice out loud  
Slow it down, slow it down  
Without it all  
I'm choking on nothing  
It's clear in my head  
And I'm screaming for something  
Knowing nothing is better than knowing at all  
  
On my own  
On my own  
On my own  
On my own  
On my own  
On my own  
  
Without it all  
I'm choking on nothing  
It's clear in my head  
And I'm screaming for something  
Knowing nothing is better than knowing at all  
  
On my own  
On my own  
On my own  
On my own

We kill the fagots, we kill the lesbians,  
I said goddammit we kill them all!  
  
We were taught to kneel and bow our heads.  
I tried simply standing up instead.  
Heard rumors of transparent legs  
And walks for days and days.  
  
These days we reach for so much more  
We reached the point where we can't go home.  
Alone we wait here underground  
Amidst the others waiting  
  
So pray, then, if it makes you feel safe.  
But all I can is we go our own way.  
We go our own way.  
So save us.  
  
Who would guess you were the chosen one?  
The right place, you were the firstborn son.  
Once questioned stable state of mind  
To spend some time in the gutter.  
  
A full collapse and caving in  
Just wait for faith to kick in  
I lost track of time as i stood in line  
Amidst the other believers.  
  
So pray then, if it makes you feel safe  
All I can say is we go are own way  
  
So pray then, if it makes you feel safe  
All I can say is we go are own way  
We go are own way  
So save us  
  
Over and over and I still can not believe  
We can't save ourselves  
Give me a chance up on the cross and watch me bleed.  
Now ask for help  
  
Having faith in something you can't see  
Takes something else  
Over and over and i still can not believe  
We can save ourselves  
  
So pray that if it makes you feel safe  
All I can say is we go are own way  
  
So pray then, if it makes you feel safe  
All I can say is we go are own way  
Send your prayers our way  
To save us  
  
Kill 'em again cuz they didn't die hard enough

The cup is not half empty as pessimists say  
As far as he's sees nothings left in the cup  
A whole cup full of nothing for him to indulge  
Since the voice of ambition has long since been shut up  
  
A singer, a writer, he's not dreaming now of going nowhere  
He gave heed to nothing, and all that he was  
Is just a tragedy  
  
So he voyages in circles  
Succeeds getting nowhere  
And submits to the substance  
That first got him there  
  
Than in violent, frustration he cries out to God or just no one  
Is there a point to this madness and all that he was  
Is just a tragedy  
  
He feels alone  
His heart in his hand  
He's alone  
He feels alone  
I feel  
  
Then on that last day he breaks  
And he stood tall  
And he yelled, and he takes his life

You bought your smile on a corner  
You paint a pretty painting, you did.  
You paint yourself in a picture  
As you deny the kind of person you've been  
  
You get what you feel, what you wish to be  
You can't live sarcastic sincenerity  
You shop in your guilt like a guillotine  
You get what you feel, you get what you feel  
  
I gave you everything, you threw it away.  
Put me out like a cigarette, out like a cigarette.  
Love like a cancer, still you beg me to stay  
Put me out like a cigarette, out like a cigarette.  
  
Come on!  
  
You pop right in to the moment,  
You paint a pretty painting, you did.  
You never noticed how broken  
As you deny the kind of person you've been  
  
You get what you feel, what you wish to be  
You can't live sarcastic sincenerity  
You shop in your guilt like a guillotine  
You get what you feel, you get what you feel  
  
I gave you everything, you threw it away.  
Put me out like a cigarette, out like a cigarette.  
Love like a cancer, still you beg me to stay  
Put me out like a cigarette, out like a cigarette.  
  
You kneel to pray,  
Live life on your knees embrace the disease.  
Start to pull in as you start to choke, your life begins.  
  
You put me out! Like a cigarette!  
  
I gave you everything, you threw it away.  
Put me out like a cigarette, out like a cigarette.  
Love like a cancer, still you beg me to stay  
Put me out like a cigarette, out like a cigarette.

How long was I sleeping? did you wake me? didn't feel like all that long.  
Do I see the morning? no it can't be happen to me.  
  
I've been stuck in the quicksand, more the pavement colours black and white
too long  
I could black out completely, but I made me, make my way back slowly.  
  
It's my time to shine, do it my way cuz it's my time baby  
It's my time to burn, start a fire, be the one and only  
I said it  
I meant it  
I never will forget it  
Change never happens by itself  
It's my time to burn, my time to shine.  
Time to make it for myself.  
  
How long was I buried? couldn't find me, laid to rest, my heart beats on.  
Kept track of the symptoms, could've killed me but you will see  
I'm not broken, I could be. yeah you would be but my heart is much too strong  
Never thought it was easy, but I made me, I made me slowly  
  
It's my time to shine, do it my way cuz it's my time baby  
It's my time to burn, start a fire, be the one and only  
I said it  
I meant it  
I never will forget it  
Change never happens by itself  
It's my time to burn, my time to shine.  
Time to make it for myself.  
  
Don't be sad, I know you well. it's just the way it has to be.  
I could never stay the same.  
It's always high, always low, and almost never in between.  
There is no one left to blame.  
I can't stay.  
I have to change.  
  
It's my time to shine, do it my way. it's my time baby  
It's my time to burn, start a fire, be the one and only  
I said it  
I meant it  
I never will forget it  
Change never happens by itself  
It's my time to burn, my time to shine.  
Time to make it for myself.  
  
Make a choice, shut up shut up.  
Do it your way, shut up shut up.

I gotta take this moment  
Just to push you down  
Spin you around with the foot on the back of your neck  
Up on the curb with the pressure on your teeth  
Your gonna take this!  
Your gonna take this!  
  
I watched the rain make a puddle to get you soaked  
The swollen words crack coming out of your throat  
A sticky time for the shallow believer  
Not gonna take this!  
Not gonna take this!  
  
I swear your head is bigger than us all  
Getting bigger  
Go slit your own throat!  
Slit your own throat!  
You're more turned on than anyone could be by yourself  
Go slit your own throat!  
Slit your own throat!  
  
Just like a tick like an itch in the back of your throat  
You missed the beat while they're hanging on every note  
You're gonna choke cause you swallowed a problem  
Your gonna take this!  
Your gonna take this!  
  
I see the flood see the terror that gets you soaked  
These kind of thoughts that you bleed I fuckin' already wrote  
Its tragic times for the shallow believer  
Your gonna take this!  
Your gonna take this!  
  
I swear your head is bigger than us all  
Getting bigger  
Go slit your own throat!  
Slit your own throat!  
You're more turned on than anyone could be by yourself  
Go slit your own throat!  
Slit your own throat!  
  
I gotta take this moment  
Just to push you down  
Spin you around with my foot on the back of your neck  
Up on the curb with the pressure on your teeth  
Not gonna take this!  
Not gonna take this!  
  
I watched the rain make a puddle to get you soaked  
The swollen words they crack coming out of your throat  
Sticky times for the shallow believer  
Not gonna take this!  
Not gonna take this!  
  
I swear your head is bigger than us all  
Getting bigger

Not gonna take this!

Let me be the one who calls you baby all the time  
Surely you can take some comfort knowing that you're mine  
Just hold me tight, lay by my side  
And let me be the one who calls you baby all the time  
  
I found my place in the world  
Could stare at your face for the rest of my days  
  
[Chorus:]  
Now I can breathe  
Turn my insides out and smother me  
Warm and alive, I'm all over you  
Would you smother me?  
  
Let me be the one who never leaves you all alone  
I hold my breath and lose the feeling that I'm on my own  
Hold me too tight, stay by my side  
And let me be the one who calls you baby all the time  
  
I found my place in the world  
Could stare at your face for the rest of my days  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Smother me  
Smother me  
  
When I'm alone, time goes so slow  
I need you here with me  
And how my mistakes have made  
Your heart break  
Still I need you here with me  
So, baby, I'm... baby, I'm here  
  
[Chorus x 2]  
  
Smother me  
Smother me  
  
Let me be the one who calls you baby all the time  
Let me be the one who calls you baby all the time  
Let me be the one who calls you baby, the one who calls you baby

I think about the worm that I've become,  
Left blind from the brightness of your halo.  
No one shines like you do.  
My filthy mouth and broken words,  
This small disease that leaves me crawling.  
Crawling to you.  
  
Crawl under ground for comfort,  
Stay close to the deck for keep from falling.  
From falling.  
  
Sold my life to bring the rain, maybe to wash me clean.  
Sold my soul to stop the pain,  
Hoping you'd set me free.  
All your pills, are you sane?  
You never took it, lay it all on me.  
You can lay it all on me.  
  
I took every chance to lash my tongue,  
You wear these scabs just like an angel.  
There's something about you.  
Whole rip of things I've done,  
Seems like this disease is slowly spreading.  
Start running, what would you do?  
  
I crawl under ground for comfort,  
Stay out of my mind to keep from dying.  
From Dying.  
  
Sold my life to bring the rain,  
Maybe to wash me clean.  
Sold my soul to stop the pain,  
Hoping you'd set me free.  
All your pills, are you sane?  
You never took it, lay it all on me.  
You can lay it all on me.  
  
Could you forget that what I said?,  
And how I died inside my head.  
We're starting over, not pretending  
That the best is dead.  
Under pain you feel you're old,  
And times I should have known.  
Don't keep it inside, let it out and let it all on me.  
  
Sold my life to bring the rain,  
Maybe to wash me clean.  
Sold my soul to stop the pain,  
Hoping you'd set me free.  
All your pills, all the pain.  
You never took it, lay it all on me.  
You can lay it all on me.

When the shirt came off, it was all in time  
When a minute turned into a mile  
And then I broke that grin, and I cut it out  
And you got all turned on by the taste of your sin  
When I mention blue, all you thought was color  
When you mention drugs, all I thought was sober  
When your pants came off and I turned you over  
When you mention blue  
  
Kill, smile, cut it out for me this time  
Smile, haven't seen him smile in awhile.  
  
Keep the mask aligned  
Get it up in time  
There's a space between valleys  
and try and catch a vibe  
Make a circle square, a rectangle curve  
Use a smile as a noun and I think like a verb  
Run quick switch sides  
Spill the filled up canister  
And the room is shaking  
Now you're changing places,  
and I switched my pace,  
and my breathing races when you mention blue  
  
Kill, smile, cut it out for me this time  
Smile, haven't seen him smile in awhile.  
Kill, smile, cut it out for me this time  
Smile, haven't seen him smile in awhile.  
You, smile, cut out for me cut it cut it out  
Smile, cut it out for me cut it cut it out  
We cut it out  
Get down and stay awake  
Smile

I'm lying to myself  
And this dagger is my excuse  
I'm a pawn  
I should have paid up  
And I left an hour late  
I was laid up  
  
I must abuse myself  
I'm against all that I've made up  
Set in stone the sun will come  
And I hate light  
You know I hate light  
To me it looks so pretty burning  
  
Burn the sun  
Burn the light  
Take take take take take take it away  
Take my hand  
Take my life  
Take take take take take take it away  
  
I must have caught something  
In the heat of all these dances  
I'm a worm with no more chances  
And I've lost all doubt  
In a chemical romance  
  
I can't stop itching  
Over thoughts of tarnished hope  
Kinda funny  
Lonely feeling  
I'm not in love  
You know it's not love  
Don't make it look so pretty burning  
  
Burn the sun  
Burn the light  
Take take take take take take it away  
Take my hand  
Take my life  
Take take take take take take it away  
  
Burn the sun  
Burn the light  
Take take take take take take it away  
Take my hand  
Take my life  
Take take take take take take it away  
  
Brothers and sisters  
I'm right here with you  
Cause everyone's got one  
A story to to kill me  
I'm so apathetic in my resentment  
Living, loving, knowing not  
  
Take my hand(x8)  
Take my life  
Take my heart take my mind  
Take my life take my life  
  
Burn the sun burn the light  
Take take take take take take it away  
Take my hand take my life  
Take take take take take take it away  
Burn the sun burn the light  
Take take take take take take it away  
Take my hand take my life  
Take my life  
Take my life

I see that face, that look in your eyes  
It's so hard to hide that look in your eyes  
You've been kicked down so many times  
Yeah you've tasted the dirt  
And you know what it's like  
  
Fill up your cup  
Fill it up to the top  
Take a sip, spit it out  
And fill it back up  
Cause you said half full  
Is never enough  
All alone and you've had enough  
  
Don't let me be, don't let me be  
All by myself, that's not how I felt  
Do I deserve to be one of the lonely?  
Hold my hand, stand by me  
All by myself that's not how I felt  
No one deserves to be one of the lonely  
Hold my hand, stand by me.  
  
I've got that face, that look in my eye  
It's impossible to hide  
That look in my eyes  
I've been kicked down so many times  
Yeah I've tasted the dirt,  
I know what it's like  
  
Fill up my cup  
Fill it up to the top  
Take a sip, spit it out  
And fill it back up  
Cause I said half full  
Is never though  
All alone and I've have enough  
  
Don't let me be, don't let me be  
All by myself, that's not how I felt  
Do I deserve to be one of the lonely?  
Hold my hand, stand by me  
All by myself that's not how I felt  
No one deserves to be one of the lonely  
Hold my hand, stand by me.  
  
How many times will we forgive  
What we just can't forget?  
Time after time and still  
We let it happen again  
How many times do we  
Deserve exactly what we get?  
I never wanted, no I never want to be  
  
All by myself  
That's not how I felt  
Do I deserve to be one of the lonely?  
Hold my hand, stand by me  
All by myself  
That's not how I felt  
No one deserves to be one of the lonely  
Hold me hand, stand by me.

The war is over if there was a war  
I hope we won  
A little boy waits with a lever on his own  
So I craft a ship to fly my way back home  
When the ocean of the sky swallows me whole  
  
I've never felt so far from home and I like it  
Never been so left alone for so long  
Forget the meaning but it needs one now  
Yet I pretended that it did somehow  
I'm going home  
  
The hand, the slavemaster, what guessed his eye  
lie in pets  
Showed me just how closely men resemble pigs  
For the blind man that must journey into hell  
I was surprised to meet my mother there as well  
  
I've never felt so far from home and I like it  
Never been so left alone for so long  
Forget the meaning but it needs one now  
Yet I pretended that it did somehow  
I'm going home  
  
I saw him flat so awkward up my hand  
Below the stars  
He Hopped in my bed we pretended to be friends  
But his sigh that could have torn this man apart  
And in his face I saw the canopy inferno  
  
I've never felt so far from home and I like it  
Never been so left alone for so long  
Forget the meaning but it needs one now  
And I pretended that it did somehow  
I'm going home

Time kills  
Go ask Jesus  
I'm done  
Makes no difference  
Stare straight  
Stare at the sun  
I'm done  
Makes no difference  
  
Time takes us all  
So, why am I not just living for today?  
Time takes us  
Time takes us all  
Will I die right now?  
I'm only seconds away  
Time takes us  
  
Move on  
Gone forever  
I'm done  
Makes no difference  
Poison  
Time kills slowly  
You're done  
Makes no difference  
  
Time takes us all  
So, why am I not just living for today?  
Time takes us  
Time takes us all  
Will I die right now?  
It could be seconds away  
Time takes us  
  
Time will now be  
Time will now be  
Time will now be (time will now be) the chopping block  
Leave my head  
Time will now be the chopping block  
So leave my head!  
Leave my head!  
Leave my head!  
  
Time kills  
Makes no difference  
I'm done  
(Makes no difference, makes no difference)  
  
(Time takes us all)  
So, why am I not just living for today?  
Time takes us  
Time takes us all  
Will I die right now?  
It could be seconds away  
Time takes us  
  
Time takes us all

Is it worth the can you even hear me  
Standing with your spotlight on me  
Not enough to feed the hungry  
I'm tired and I felt it for awhile now  
In this sea of lonely  
The taste of ink is getting old  
It's four o' clock in the fucking morning  
Each day gets more and more like the last day  
Still I can see it coming  
While I'm standing in the river drowning  
This could be my chance to break out  
This could be my chance to say goodbye  
At last it's finally over  
Couldn't take this town much longer  
Being half dead wasn't what I planned to be  
Now I'm ready to be free  
  
So here I am it's in my hands  
And I'll savor every moment of this  
So here I am alive at last  
And I'll savor every moment of this  
  
Won't you think I'm pretty  
When I'm standing top the bright lit city  
And I'll take your hand and pick you up  
And keep you there so you can see it  
As long as you're alive and care  
I promise I will take you there  
We'll drink and dance the night away  
We'll drink and dance the night away  
  
So here I am it's in my hands  
And I'll savor every moment of this  
So here I am alive at last  
And I'll savor every moment of this  
Savor every moment of this  
  
As long as you're alive  
Here I am  
I promise I will take you there  
  
As long as you're alive  
Here I am  
I promise I will take you there  
  
Won't you think I'm pretty  
When I'm standing top the bright lit city  
And I'll take your hand and pick you up  
And keep you there so you can see it  
So long as you're alive and care  
I promise I will take you there  
So long as you're alive and care  
I promise I will take you there  
  
So here I am it's in my hands  
And I'll savor every moment of this  
So here I am alive at last  
And I'll savor every moment of this  
Savor every moment of this  
Savor every moment of this

I made a deal with the holy ghost  
I made a plan to preserve the peace  
Before I started I lost my guts  
Saw traces of the past destroyed  
  
Always thought I could write it down  
Where'd it go, and you read my mind  
Make an enemy like a friend that never existed  
  
I let you get to me  
I let you get to me  
I let the ability to stay collected keep my head  
  
I thought I knew everything  
I thought I knew what it meant to me  
Turns out I don't know anything  
Just know enough to keep my head  
And just play dead  
  
Is the criminal in your thoughts  
Like a poppy that blessed the fields  
And the price that is on my head  
Inflates the cost of smut magazines  
  
Just take a look at what we believe  
Selling freedom to slavery  
You have us screaming that  
War is peace  
And strength is ignorance  
  
I let you get to me  
I let you get to me  
I let the ability to stay collected keep my head  
  
I thought I knew everything  
I thought I knew what it meant to me  
Turns out I don't know anything  
Just know enough to keep my head  
And just play dead  
Just play dead  
  
I let you get to me  
I let you get to me  
I let the ability to stay collected keep my head  
  
I let you get to me  
I let you get to me  
I let the ability to stay collected keep my head  
  
I thought I knew everything  
I thought I knew what it meant to me  
Turns out I don't know anything  
Just know enough to keep my head  
And just play dead

Feel the pain wash over me  
Feel the salt that's burning from my eyes  
Feel the world move underneath me  
Know there is no need for my disguise  
Feel the screams as you take my hand  
  
I understand the terror in your eyes  
Feel I've lost myself completely  
I need to know you're right here by my side  
I won't pretend that we could live forever  
  
I think it's gunna be alright, now  
I think it's gunna be okay  
Just close your eyes  
Just we are just sparks  
But together burning bright  
  
I see the daylight start to fade  
I see the cold move softly with the night  
I feel the darkness stop to take me  
Now I know there is nowhere to hide  
  
Feel the world start caving in  
I feel the hollow nothing left inside  
No, I've lost myself completely  
I need to know you're right here by my side  
I won't pretend that we could live forever  
  
I think it's gunna be alright, now  
I think it's gunna be okay  
Just close your eyes  
'Cause we are only sparks  
But together burning bright  
  
I think it's gunna be alright, now  
I think it's gunna be okay  
Just close your eyes  
'Cause we are only sparks  
But together burning bright  
  
Yeah together burning bright  
(dah dah dah)  
We are only sparks  
But together burning bright  
  
I won't pretend that we could live forever  
I think it's gunna be alright, now  
I think it's gunna be okay  
Just close your eyes  
'Cause we are only sparks  
Together burning bright  
  
I get the feeling it's alright, now  
I get the feeling it's okay  
Just close your eyes  
Cause we are only sparks  
But together burning bright  
  
I think it's gunna be alright, now  
I think it's gunna be okay  
Just close your eyes  
'Cause we are only sparks  
But together burning bright

In my eyes  
Course and jaded  
It's no surprise  
The lights have faded  
I always walk away  
You'll always hear me say  
I don't need this  
I've been given such a gift  
Shame to take advantage of it  
Watch it, wasting leaves you wanting more  
Be careful what you're wishing for  
  
Nothing that I can hold on to  
With my broken hands  
Not thinking that I should anyway  
So I leave holding nothing  
Don't care what you say  
Cause it makes no difference if I throw it away  
Yeah, it makes no difference if I throw it away  
  
Now my days are feeling numbered  
This sad cliche I'm hiding under  
This spider web of dreams  
I'm stuck here as it seems to be breaking  
Shining brighter than you burn  
Something that I would never learn  
I could never lay this curse on you  
Cursing the days where there's  
  
Nothing that I can hold on to  
With my broken hands  
Not thinking that I should anyway  
So I leave holding nothing  
Don't care what you say  
Cause it makes no difference if I throw it away  
Cause it makes no difference  
Yeah, it makes no difference if I throw it away  
It makes no difference  
It makes no difference if I throw it away  
Makes no difference if I throw it away  
Throw it away  
Throw it away  
  
It all just ends up tasting watered down  
(Instead of being so complicated)  
And everyone has found an easy way out, an easy way out  
It all just ends up tasting watered down  
(Instead of being so complicated)  
And everyone has found an easy way out, an easy way out  
  
Nothing that I can hold on to  
With my broken hands  
Not thinking that I should anyway  
So I leave holding nothing  
Don't care what you say  
Cause it makes no difference if I throw it away  
Cause it makes no difference  
Yeah, it makes no difference if I throw it away  
It makes no difference  
It makes no difference if I throw it away  
Yeah, it makes no difference if I throw it away  
Throw it away  
Throw it away  
  
Get outta town by Sunday  
I say if they don't get outta town  
We kill the men  
We kill the women  
We kill the children  
We kill the babies  
We kill the blind  
We kill the crippled  
We kill the crazy

Close my eyes and move to the back of my mind  
The worries are washed out to sea  
See the changes, people's faces blurred out  
Like sunspots or raindrops  
  
Now all those feelings, those yesterdays feelings will all be lost in time  
But today I've wasted away for today is on my mind  
  
Left the only worries I had in my hands  
Away from the light in my eyes  
Holding tight and try not to hide how I feel  
  
Now feelings mean nothing  
  
All those feelings, those yesterdays feelings will all be lost in time  
But today I've wasted away for today is on my mind (today is on my mind)  
  
I can't get a worry  
I'm feeling so lonely  
Breaking apart all this love in my heart  
Close my eyes and move to the back of my mind  
  
Where feelings mean nothing  
  
All those feelings, those yesterdays feelings will all be lost in time  
But today I've wasted away, for today is on my mind  
But today I've wasted away, for today is on my mind  
But today I've wasted away, for today is on my mind  
  
I can't get a worry  
I'm feeling so lonely  
Breaking apart all this love in my heart
