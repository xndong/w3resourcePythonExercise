Snowy night, where it's warm here by the fire  
Here with you, I have all that I desire  
(Here with you)  
It's been a long year but somehow we got by  
Now, it's Christmas eve and love is on our side  
I don't need a hundred gifts beneath the tree  
(Beneath the tree)  
Don't you know the best thing you could give to me  
Nothin' else will do, all I want is you this Christmas  
(This Christmas, this Christmas)  
Children sing Christmas carols at our door, yeah, yeah, yeah  
(Children sing)  
Spreading joy, that's what Christmas time is for  
(Spreading joy)  
Though we don't have much, you've got me and I've got you  
Yeah, yeah, yeah and with a little faith miracles come true  
And I don't need a hundred gifts beneath the tree  
(Beneath the tree)  
Don't you know the best thing you could give to me  
Nothin' else will do, all I want is you this Christmas  
(This Christmas, this Christmas)  
I don't want the love of any other girl  
I want only one thing in this whole wide world  
Nothing else will do, all I want is you this Christmas  
(This Christmas, this Christmas)  
Cheek to cheek, the lights are low, a kiss beneath the mistletoe  
Your face lit by the fire's glow, that's all I want tonight  
And I don't need a hundred gifts beneath the tree  
Don't you know the best thing you could give to me  
Nothin' else will do, all I want is you this Christmas  
(This Christmas, this Christmas)  
Nothin' else will do, all I want is you this Christmas, yes  

If I was down, would your arms lift me up to higher ground  
With just the strength of your love  
If I was lost would I find something in your eyes to lead me home  
  
And if it all went wrong  
Would you be there to hold  
It's easy to be there through the good times  
But when the times get hard  
Would you stay or walk away  
  
Chorus:  
Are you gonna be there when the rain comes  
Are you gonna be there with a warm touch  
Can you swear you'll be there with a real love  
Are you gonna be there  
Will you stand by my side through the bad times  
Through whatever will be, will you still be mine  
Will you stay in my life for a lifetime  
Are you gonna be there  
  
When I need someone to hold  
Someone there for me  
Are you gonna be there  
  
But in my world  
If it should all fall down  
Will you be there  
Be there to turn it around  
Will you still care  
Can I depend on you to see me through this life  
  
And if it all goes wrong  
Will you still make it right  
It's easy to be there through the good times  
But when the times get hard  
Will you still be on my side  
  
Chorus  
  
When I need someone beside me  
Someone there for me  
Are you gonna be  
There with the arms to hold me  
There with the love I need with you baby  
Will you be there  
Heart and soul I need to know  
  
Are you gonna be there  
Are you gonna still care  
Are you gonna be there  
Will you stand by my side  
Are you gonna be mine  
Are you gonna be there  
  
Chorus

Jive talkin'  
You're telling me lies, yeah  
Jive talkin'  
You wear a disguise  
Jive talkin'  
So misunderstood, yeah  
Jive talkin'  
You're really no good  
  
Nobody gets too much heaven no more  
It's much harder to come by  
I'm waiting in line  
Nobody gets too much love anymore  
It's as high as a mountain  
And harder to climb  
  
How deep is your love  
How deep is your love  
I really need to learn  
'Cause we're living in a world of fools  
Breaking us down  
And they all should let us be  
We belong to you and me  
Do, do, do, do  
How deep is your love  
Do, do  
How deep is your  
Do, do, do, do  
How deep is your love  
Do, do, do, do  
How deep is your love  
  
Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk  
I'm a woman's man  
No time to talk  
Music's loud and feeling's warm  
I've been doing it right since I was born  
But that's all right  
That's ok  
We can look the other way  
We can try to understand  
The New York Times' effect on man  
  
Whether you're a mother or whether you're a brother  
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive  
Feel the city breakin' and everybody shakin'  
People stayin' alive, stayin' alive  
Ha, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive  
Ha, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive  
  
Yeah  
I'm staying alive

Oh you can be what you wanna be  
See what you wanna see  
Believe in yourself, just believe in yourself  
You can go where you wanna go  
Do what you wanna do  
Believe in yourself, just believe in yourself  
  
Some folks try to tell you there are things you shouldn't do  
But you're not strong enough, or smart enough at all  
But what seems right to them, quite often might be wrong for you  
So be sure you try to climb before you get to scare you'll fall  
  
You can be what you wanna be  
Learn what you wanna learn  
Believe in yourself, just believe in yourself  
You can try what you need to try  
No one should question why  
Believe in yourself, just belive in yourself  
  
Folks may say you're different  
That you've gone and lost your senses  
But the world is your to walk  
Go ahead and leave the fences  
And you'll see(and you'll see)  
Belive in yourself  
And the world belongs to you  
You and me  
And the world belongs to you and me

There you are  
Looking as fine as can be  
In your fancy car  
I can see you looking at me  
What you want to do  
Are you just going to sit there and stare Baby talk to me  
Tell me what's on your mind, Baby Ohhh  
  
[Chorus:]  
Oh Baby bring it all to me (Bring it all)  
But i don't need no fancy cars or diamond rings (Baby I don't need, No)

Hey baby come on

When you weren't there for me  
So now it's time to leave and make it alone

I just want to tell you that I've had enough  
It might sound crazy but it ain't no lie  
Baby bye bye bye  
  
You just hit me with the truth  
Now girl you're more than welcome to  
So give me one good reason  
Baby come on

And now I really come to see  
That life would be much better once you're gone

[Chorus 1: x2]  
  
Digital, digital get down (get down) Just what we need

Waiting, for your piece of the pie  
To drop out of the sky(gotta go get it)  
Hesitating, for somebody else  
To run and pass you by(never get your time)  
  
[Bridge]  
There ain't no excuse for losing your feet  
Drowning in your defeat, on this road of life  
There ain't no excuse for coming up short, the ball is in your court  
So reach up and touch the sky  
  
[Chorus]  
Are you doing your thing and doing it well  
Are they looking at you hating singing oh  
Are you doing your thing and doing it good  
Do your thing thing (oh), do your thing thing (oh)  
  
(do your thing) Do Your Thing, oh (oh)  
Keeping yourself from taking  
On your perfect dream(you had to be open)  
And being something  
Somewhere that you read in a magazine(but you never let you shine)  
  
[Bridge]  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Are you doing your thing, well  
Are you letting your dreams, come alive  
Are you doing your thing, good  
Believe can nobody do it better than you, believe can nobody do it better than
you  
  
Gotta walk, gotta break, gotta call, gotta take, everything that I bring,
never do fall  
Gotta hump, gotta bump, never sit on a stump, never quit on a swell of a lump  
If you really want it bad  
You can't ever drag your feet to the beat of the sound of defeat  
Even if you got heat  
Whoa  
Never take your mad off to defeat, so  
  
[Bridge]  
  
[Chorus: x3]  
  
Do your thing, do your thing, baby  
Do your thing, All them looking at ya, All them looking at ya  
(Believe can nobody do it better than you, believe can nobody do it better
than you)  
Do your thing, oh  
Yeah  
Oh  
Yeah  
(Believe can nobody do it better than you, believe can nobody do it better
than you)  
Oh  
  
Do your thing [Repeat: x4]

You sheltered me from harm  
You kept me warm, you kept me warm  
And you gave my life to me  
You set me free, you set me free  
The finest years I ever knew  
Were all the years I had with you  
  
And I would give everything I own  
I'd give up my life, my heart, my home  
I would give everything I own  
Just to have you back again  
  
You taught me how to love  
What it's of, what it's of  
You never said too much  
But still you showed the way  
And I knew from watching you  
Nobody else could ever know  
The part of me that can't let go  
  
And I would give everything I own  
I'd give up my life, my heart, and my home  
I would give everything I own  
Just to have you back again  
  
Is there someone you know  
You're loving them so  
But taking them all for granted  
You may lose them one day  
Someone takes them away  
And they don't hear the words you long to say  
  
Yeah  
Give up my life, give up my heart  
Everything I own  
  
You know, baby  
My love for you will always be true  
That's right  
Because there is no me without you  
  
I would give everything I own  
Everything I own  
Nobody can love you, like I do  
  
And I would give everything I own  
I'd give up my life, my heart, my home  
I would give everything I own  
Just to have you back again  
Just to have you back again

You drive a pretty car, you know how fine you are  
And nobody needs to say it, no way  
They love the clothes you wear, they compliment you  
And I just love the way you play it  
  
But the only thing you dream of  
Money can't buy for you, oh  
And in my dreams I'll make your wish come true  
  
For the girl who has everything, I bring you love  
I bring you love  
'Cause the girl who has everything can't get enough  
Of my love  
  
Why do you run and hide, say what you feel inside  
(Say what you feel)  
Why must you always fake it, oh yeah  
Girl you need to understand  
Your heart's safe within my hands  
I promise I'll never break it, oh  
  
I know that you still dream of  
What money can't buy for you  
And in my dreams I'll make your wish come true  
  
For the girl who has everything, I bring you love  
I bring you love (I bring you love)  
'Cause the girl who has everything can't get enough  
Enough of my love  
  
If you just let me try  
(My baby listen)  
I'll help you find  
(What you've been missing)  
Oh yeah, you gotta listen to your heart  
And not your mind  
Oh baby yeah  
  
For the girl who has everything, I bring you love  
(I bring you love) I bring you love, yeah  
'Cause the girl who has everything can't get enough  
Of my love  
  
(For the girl who has everything)  
Oh girl, you want my love, I'm gonna give it to you  
(I bring you love)  
('Cause the girl who has everything can't get enough)  
Of my love

You know  
That I love you  
In every way  
You bring  
So many magical wonders  
To my day  
  
How could I ever leave  
One reason why  
Cause darlin' without you  
I cannot breathe  
You're the best thing  
In all my life  
The only one  
Who helps me through  
So much pain and strife  
  
Baby you know...  
Chorus:  
You'll always be in my heart  
We'll never have reaons  
To ever part  
When I look into yor eyes  
All I see is you and I  
Together, forever in your heart  
  
Darlin' yes  
I love you more than words can say  
  
You'll always be mine  
No matter where you are  
You're always at the front  
Of my mind  
Only for eternity  
You've touched my heart  
With undying hope  
With your love  
My problems can cope  
No one will ever take your place  
When I close my eyes  
I see me  
Kissing your sweet face  
  
You're much more beautiful  
Than Heaven's glowing embrace  
Chorus  
  
You'll alwyas be  
Forever with me  
Baby, just wait and see  
You're my dream come true  
And all I can say

Only when I'm with you  
Holding you near

Only always  
Forever in your heart

Remembering the way we used to be

Would you be my Girlfriend? [Repeat: x3]  
I like you, right  
Would you be my Girlfriend?  
  
I don't know why you care  
He doesn't even know you're there  
Cause he don't love your eyes  
And he don't love your smile  
Girl you know that ain't fair  
  
In the middle of the night  
Is he going to be by your side  
Or will he run and hide  
You don't know cuz things ain't clear  
And baby when you cry  
Is he gonna stand by your side  
Does the man even know you're alive  
I got an idea  
  
Why don't you be my girlfriend  
I'll treat you good  
I know you hear your friends when they say  
You should  
Cause if you were my girlfriend  
I'd be your shining star  
The one who'll show you where you are  
Girl you should be my girlfriend  
  
Does he know what you feel  
Are you sure that t's real  
Does he ease your mind  
Or does he break your stride  
Did you know that love could be a shield  
  
In the middle of the night correcting  
Is he going to be BY your side  
Or will he run and hide  
You don't know cause things ain't clear  
And baby when you cry  
Is he gonna stand by your side  
Does the man even know you're alive  
I got an idea  
  
Why don't you be my girlfriend  
I'll treat you good  
I know you hear your friends when they say  
You should  
Cause if you were my girlfriend  
I'd be your shining star  
The one who'll show you where you are  
Girl you should be my girlfriend  
  
Ever since I saw your face  
Nothing in my life has been the same  
I'll walk around just saying your name  
Without you, my world would end, yeah  
I've looked around this whole, damn place  
And everything says you were meant to be  
My girlfriend, oh  
  
Why don't you be my girlfriend  
I'll treat you good  
I know you hear your friends when they say  
You should  
Cause if you were my girlfriend  
I'd be your shining star  
The one who'll show you where you are  
Girl you should be my girlfriend  
  
Girl you should be My girlfriend [Repeat: x5]  
My girlfriend

Aaaaaahhhhhhhh  
Ooooooooooo  
Heeeeeeey  
  
Your love like a candle  
Flickers in the dark  
You came into my life  
Brightened up my heart  
  
With you by my side  
I see the love that I wanna feel  
Show me your lovin' baby  
Show me that it's real  
  
Just take my hand  
I'll make you understand  
I want you (I want you)  
You want me (you want me too)  
And that's the way it's got to be  
Now that you're here  
I'm gonna make it clear  
  
Chorus:  
Give me the love I need  
Give in to me  
Hold me, caress me  
Give in to me  
Give me the love I need  
Give in to me  
Just give in to me  
  
Your love is like a whisper (whisper)  
Say what I wanna hear (what I wanna hear)  
Your eyes cry secrets  
And my heart will dry your tears  
I need to have you near me  
Loving I would find  
Girl, I would hold your heart  
Inside, embrace your mind  
  
Just take my hand  
I'll make you understand  
I want you (I want you)  
You want me (you want me too)  
And that's the way it's got to be  
Now that you're here  
I'm gonna make it clear  
  
Chorus  
  
Just give me the love I need  
I need your lovin' tonight, sweet lady  
I wonder what the nights'd be like  
Without you near me  
Yeah, give in to me, girl  
I need you by my side  
Just give me the love I need  
I need your lovin', baby  
I need your love  
I need your love  
  
(Chorus repeat to fade)

Can this be true, tell me can this be real  
How can I put into words what I feel  
My life was complete, I thought I was whole  
Why do I feel like I'm losing control  
  
I never thought that love could feel like this  
Then you changed my world with just one kiss  
How can it be that right here with me  
There's an angel, it's a miracle  
  
Your love is like a river  
Peaceful and deep  
Your soul is like a secret that I never could keep  
When I look into your eyes  
I know that it's true  
God must have spent a little more time on you  
Oh a little more time, yes he did baby  
  
In all of creation, all things great and small  
You are the one that surpasses them all  
More precious than and diamond or pearl  
They broke the mold when you came in this world  
  
And I'm trying hard to figure out  
Just how I ever did without  
The warmth of your smile, the heart of a child  
That's deep inside and leaves me purified  
  
Your love is like a river  
Peaceful and deep  
Your soul is like a secret that I never could keep  
When I look into your eyes  
I know that it's true  
God must have spent a little more time on you  
  
On you...  
Yes he did baby  
  
I never thought that love could feel like this  
Then you changed my world with just one kiss  
How can it be that right here with me  
There's an angel, it's a miracle  
  
Your love is like a river  
Peaceful and deep  
Your soul is like a secret that I never could keep  
When I look into your eyes  
I know that it's true  
God must have spent a little more time on you  
  
On you...  
God must have spent a little more time on you  
A little more time on you, oh

Feel the magic in the air  
Christmas is all around  
Something about this special time of year  
A blanket of snow falls down from the sky  
Voices of angels  
Open our hearts so we can open our arms  
  
[Chorus:]  
And we'll all join hands  
To celebrate the goodness  
That shines inside of everyone  
It must have been a part of some great design  
Guess it's Christmas time  
  
Seein' the faces of the little boys and girls  
Singing their First Noel  
A sweet refrain heard all around the world  
A song of forgiveness, comforting peace  
A time to remember what life really means (Life really means)  
The important things (Important things)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Guess it's Christmas time  
Open our hearts so we can open our arms  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Must have been a part of some great design  
Guess it's Christmas time  
Merry Christmas

You're all I ever wanted  
You're all I ever needed, yeah  
So tell me what to do now  
'Cause I want you back  
  
It's hard to say I'm sorry  
It's hard to make the things I did undone  
A lesson I've learned too well, for sure  
So don't hang up the phone now  
I'm trying to figure out just what to do  
I'm going crazy without you  
  
You're all I ever wanted  
You're all I ever needed, yeah  
So tell me what to do now  
When I want you back  
  
Baby I remember  
The way you used to look at me and say  
Promises never last forever  
I told you not to worry  
I said that everything would be all right  
I didn't know then that you were right  
  
Yeah  
I want you back, oh yeah  
  
You're the one I want  
You're the one I need  
Girl, what can I do

And you're shining like the sun  
Tell me why can't I still be the one, alright

Cause my heart is in your hands  
Don't you understand  
I'll never stop  
  
I'll never stop  
How could I ever  
When my heart is in your hands  
And I know, baby there is no turning back  
They say that I'm crazy  
And I kind of understand  
How I wish for this nightmare to end  
  
Oh yes

Until you're mine  
I can wait forever, till the end of time  
Cause my heart is in your hands  
Don't you understand

Jingle bells, jingle bells  
Jingle all the way  
  
Christmas time is so special (Special, special)  
When you're kissing me (Under the, under the) under the mistletoe  
Exchanging loving gifts  
Sitting in front of the tree  
Me holding you and you holding me  
  
[Chorus]  
Wishing, I pray to be in love on Christmas  
Because Christmas love gives me that feeling  
Wishing, I pray to be in love on Christmas  
Because everybody should be in love with somebody on Christmas  
  
Last year, Christmas  
It happened without us (Out us, out us)  
I was all mixed up and confused  
I didn't know what to do baby (What to do babe)  
I never thought I'd feel this way  
I always thought that Christmas was a happy day  
I always prayed that Santa'd pack love on his sleigh  
And send it my way  
  
[Chorus]  
  
What a beautiful time (Oh what a beautiful time it is)  
Time it is  
A time to open gifts, and play with all the kids  
Yes, it's Christmas (Yes, it's Christmas)  
Yes, it's Christmas time again (Christmas time again)  
Girl I love you (Girl I love you baby)  
Yes, I love you (Yes I love you baby)  
  
It's Christmas time again (Oh)  
To be in love on Christmas (girl I love you baby, yes I love you baby)  
What a beautiful time it is  
Happy time to open gifts  
Yes now it's Christmas time  
And I am yours  
And you are mine  
Oh when you're kissin' me  
Right under my Christmas tree  
Baby come close to me  
'Cause this is how it should be!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Grandmamma with my Granddaddy,  
And my Momma and my Daddy,  
I'm with you on Christmas)

Oh  
Ohhh  
Ohhh  
I'm gonna tell you now, oh, oh  
When I had you to myself I didn't want you around  
Those pretty faces always make you stand out in a crowd  
But someone picked you from the bunch one glance is all it took  
And now it's much too late for me to take a second look  
Oh baby, give me one more chance  
To show you that I love you  
Won't you please let me  
Back in your heart  
Oh darlin', I was blind to let you go  
Let you go, baby  
And now when I've seen you it is on  
I want you back  
Yes I know now  
I want you back  
Ooh ooh baby

Never ever knew before

Why two plus two makes four  
Now, now, now  
I'm gonna teach you

Chasing boys was just a fad  
You crossed your heart you'd quit  
Now and back in grade school  
I promised you a ring  
Just like back in grade school  
You're doing the same old thing  
Stop! The love you save may be your own  
Darling, take it slow  
Or some day you'll be all alone  
  
You'd better stop the love you save may be your own  
Darling, look both ways before you cross me  
Headed for the danger zone  
All Hold on  
Hold on  
Hold on  
Hold on  
S is for Save it

The love you save may be your own  
Some day you may be all alone  
All Hold on  
Hold on  
Stop

Techy Ruse  
  
I'm sick and tired hearing all these people study about  
What's the deal with this school life and when is it gonna fade out?  
The thing you've got to realise what we're doing is James Ruse trend  
We've got the books 'til insanity, we're gonna study to the end  
  
C'mon now...  
It doesn't matter  
'Bout the textbooks that I balance on my head  
All that matters  
Is that you recognize that it's just about results  
It doesn't matter  
'Bout the books I read, or what I learn and why  
All that matters  
Is that we're the best and we top you every time  
  
C'mon now...  
Do you every wonder why  
The study gets you high?  
It takes you on a ride  
You feel it when your  
Brain starts to fry  
Your social life will die  
And the books' are all you've got  
This must be... Ruse!  
  
Techy Ruse  
Nerd, nerd you can't stop  
I know you love this  
Techy Ruse  
This must be...  
  
Now, why is the highest uai your passion through and through?  
Why can't you chill and do the things you once used to do?  
If a day without your math book will cut like a knife,  
Drop your pens and burn your notes and go and get a life...  
  
It doesn't matter  
That I don't need a calculator  
All that matters  
Is that you recognize it's just about results  
It doesn't matter  
'Bout the news I watch, or news I read, and why  
All that matters  
Is that we're the best and we'll top you anytime  
  
C'mon  
Do you every wonder why (why?)  
The study gets you high? (gets you high)  
It takes you on a ride  
You feel it when your  
Brain starts to fry (brain starts to fry)  
Your social life will die (life will die)  
And the books' are all you got (nerd, c'mon!)

Oh oh, no no, all right  
You got to be seen at every party  
At the playboy mansion  
But, sad  
I know I gotta draw the line  
You want to be in  
The flashes of light  
Holding me tight  
With your phony laugh  
I guess  
You gotta be photographed  
  
You can say it's real  
But I know where it's at  
  
Just don't tell me that  
You are gonna love me  
I don't want to hear it baby  
Tell me that  
It's gonna be your last lie  
No baby I won't go for that  
Even if you did say  
You were gonna be there  
I don't want you back  
'Cause it's not about love  
Just don't tell me that  
  
You like to drive in my car  
Spend every dollar of my credit  
Baby, guess what  
Saw me with your golden eye  
Guess you want to be  
Part of the ride  
Live for the night  
But I've seen it through  
Had enough of being close to you  
  
You can say it's real  
But I know where it's at  
  
Just don't tell me that  
You are gonna love me  
I don't want to hear it baby  
Tell me that  
It's gonna be your last lie  
No baby I won't go for that  
Even if you did say  
You were gonna be there  
I don't want you back  
'Cause it's not about love  
Just don't tell me that  
  
No no, it's not about love  
No no  
  
You want to be in  
The flashes of light  
Holding me tight  
Girl it's all up to you  
But whatever you do  
I don't want to hear it  
  
You're not gonna love me  
I won't go for that  
It just won't last  
Even if you did say  
You were gonna be there  
I don't want you back  
'Cause it's not about love  
Just don't tell me that  
  
You are gonna love me  
I don't want to hear it baby  
Tell me that  
It's gonna be your last lie  
No baby I won't go for that  
Even if you did say  
You were gonna be there  
I don't want you back  
'Cause it's not about love  
Just don't tell me that

Thank God that it's Friday night and I  
Just-just-just-just-just got paid  
Yea, Oh  
  
Just got paid Friday night  
  
[Chorus]  
Just got paid, Friday night  
Party's hoppin', place is right  
Booties shaking, all around  
Pump that jam, while I'm getting down  
  
Check the mirror, I'm lookin' fly  
Round up the posse, jump in my ride  
Radio rockin', smooth jams  
Feel the rhythm, pump up the sound  
I'm feelin' good don't you know I'm grooving  
To the beat  
I'm groovin', yea, grooving, oh oh oh oh  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Some say my solo is impossible  
But when I get up on the mic, I'm unstoppable  
And it's probably when you hear our voices laid down  
You'll be bopping your head to this ill tight sound  
  
Now I know you probably thought ya had me  
Played (played)  
But the check is in my hand and I got it made(made)  
And you'll notice my smile is like cool-aid  
Cause I just(just) got(got) paid(paid)  
  
On the floor bumping to the beat  
All ways sure looks sweet  
Fine young lady, standin' by  
Come on baby, sweet like delight

Kiss me at midnight  
5...4...3...2...1  
Kiss me at midnight  
Dance into the morning light  
Party into the new year  
All of my friends are here and when the time is right  
Kiss me at midnight (kiss)  
  
I've been waiting for this special night  
To be with you  
The colors of Christmas are still shining bright  
And I know what we're gonna do  
  
Anticipating  
Music is playing  
The magic is in the air  
All through the season  
You've been the reason  
I have so much love to share  
  
Kiss me at midnight  
Dance into the morning light  
Party into the new year  
All of my friends are here and when the time is right  
Kiss me at midnight (kiss)  
  
We've been making promises in the dark  
Our resolutions  
As a brand new year is about to start  
And we're together  
Celebrating  
No more waiting  
Our time has arrived  
Feel the beat of my heart  
As the countdown starts  
Just look into my eyes  
  
Kiss me at midnight  
Dance into the morning light  
Party into the new year  
All of my friends are here and when the time is right  
Kiss me at midnight (kiss)  
  
Baby it's New Years Eve  
A time we can believe  
In making wishes  
Dreams come true  
Just for me and you  
  
Kiss me at midnight  
Dance into the morning light  
Party into the new year  
All of my friends are here and when the time is right  
Kiss me at midnight (kiss)  
Kiss me at midnight  
Dance into the morning light  
Party into the new year  
All of my friends are here and when the time is right  
Kiss me at midnight (kiss)

Oh, if someone writes a song  
With a simple rhyme  
Just a song  
Where his feelings show  
And if someone feels the same  
About this simple song  
Oh, and sometimes, you can hear them say  
Music gives you happiness or sadness  
But it also, it also heals your soul  
  
Let the music heal your soul  
Let the music take control  
Let the music give you the power to move any mountain  
  
Oh, if someone plays piano  
With some simple chords  
Symbolic and endearing too  
And know if someone plays guitar  
With the old piano  
Then maybe you can hear them sing  
Music gives you happiness or sadness  
But it also  
Also heals your soul  
  
Oh yes  
Let the music heal your soul  
Let the music take control  
Let the music heal your soul  
Let the music heal your soul  
Let the music take control..

Baby, you're not the only one  
I see the things he does to you  
All the pain that he puts you through  
If I see what's really going on  
Staying out at night  
While you're by the phone  
  
Take it from me  
It's a lesson to be learned  
Even the good guys get burned  
Take it from me  
See, I would give you love  
The kind of love that you've only dreamed of  
  
Baby, you're not the only one  
You don't have to be afraid to fall in love  
And I know that you've hurt in the past  
But if you want it here's my heart  
No strings attached  
  
He doesn't give you the kind of attention  
That a girl like you needs (that a girl like you needs)  
'cause he always looks around  
His eyes wander around  
He doesn't see you like I see  
  
Take it from me  
It's a lesson to be learned  
Even the good guys get burned  
Take it from me  
Baby, I would give you love  
The kind of love that you'd only dreamed of  
  
Baby, you're not the only one (baby, you're not the only one)  
You don't have to be afraid to fall in love (to fall in love)  
And I know that you've hurt in the past (hurt in the past)  
If you want it here's my heart (here's my heart)  
No strings attached  
  
Take it from me  
It's a lesson to be learned  
Even the good guys get burned  
Take it from me  
See, I would give you love  
The kind of love that you've only dreamed of  
  
So if you want to take a chance with me  
(If you) Baby (take) take a chance (a chance) with me  
(I'll be every-) Everything you need (-thing you need)  
(Because it's our destiny)

(I know that you've hurt in the past) You've hurt in  
the past  
(I'll be everything you need)  
If you want it here's my heart

not the only one  
(I'll be) (You don't have to be afraid to) You don't  
have (fall in love) to be afraid  
(And I know) (because it's our destiny) (that you've  
hurt in the past) I know that you're hurtin'  
If you want it here's my heart  
No strings attached

Now we're here  
J-you-S-T-I-N(what what)  
We are here for you  
What's that you say  
Baby its okay  
Cuz you know we're ugly  
  
Chorus  
Bsb kicks our ass  
Because they always do  
Baby I know we're lucky  
But look on the bright side  
We are loaded  
And can buy you things  
  
So ignore our strange looks  
And when you kiss us  
You can picture B-rok if you want  
But please baby  
Hold my hand  
Cuz britney wont touch me

O holy night  
The stars are brightly shining  
It is the night  
Of our dear saviors birth  
  
Long lay the world  
In sin and error pining  
'til he appeared  
And the soul felt it's worth  
  
The thrill of hope  
The weary world rejoices  
For yonder breaks  
A new and glorious morn  
Oh fall on your knees  
Oh hear the angels voices  
Oh night divine  
Oh night when christ was born  
  
Oh holy night  
Oh night divine  
Oh holy night  
Oh night divine  
  
The thrill of hope  
The weary world rejoices  
For yonder breaks  
A new and glorious morn  
Fall on your knees  
Oh hear the angels voices  
Oh night divine  
Oh night when christ was born  
  
Oh night  
Divine  
Oh night divine  
Oh holy night  
Oh night divine  
  
Oh holy night  
When christ was born  
Holy night when christ was born

I'm laying it  
On the line to show you  
I'll never let you go  
On the line for your love  
There's nothing I want more  
  
Another dead-end street, another love gone wrong  
Another shattered dream, always the same old song  
I started thinking that you never come along  
I've got all this love inside and that was all that was tonight  
I'm wish you knew what I've been through to get you  
  
I meant it  
On the line to show you  
I'll never let you go  
On the line for your love  
There's nothing I want more  
When you smile  
I feel my heart open and I know there's nothing that I wouldn't do  
I'm laying it  
On the line this time  
Just to be with you  
  
After everything my heart's been through  
I treasure every moment I spend with you  
For me to feel this way is something new  
Now it's got a hold on me it's making me believe  
The love we got is something unlike any other  
  
I'm laying it  
On the line to show you  
I'll never let you go  
On the line for your love  
There's nothing I want more  
When you smile  
I feel my heart open and I know there's nothing that I wouldn't do  
I'm laying it  
On the line this time  
Just to be with you  
  
If you think it wasn't thinking, all you gotta do is say the words  
(Say the words)  
If you tell me what you need then I can give you what you ask for  
(Ask for)  
  
When I didn't have a prayer, I thought nobody cared  
I turned around and you were there  
  
Now I've been waiting for you  
(Oh waiting for you baby)  
And I want you to know  
(I want you to know)  
  
On the line to show you  
(That I'll never let you go)  
On the line for your love  
(There's nothing I want more)  
When you smile  
I feel my heart open and I know there's nothing that I wouldn't do  
(Nothing that I wouldn't do)  
  
I'm laying it  
On the line to show you  
(Never gonna let you go)  
On the line for your love  
There's nothing I want more  
When you smile  
I feel my heart open and I know there's nothing that I wouldn't do  
  
I meant it  
On the line this time  
Just to be with you

My shattered dreams and broken heart are mending on the shelf.  
I saw you holding hands, standing close to someone else.  
Still I sit all alone, wishing all my feelings were gone.  
I gave my best to you, nothing for me to do..  
  
Chorus:  
But have one last cry, one last cry, Before I leave it all behind. I got to
put you out of my mind, this time, believe a lie, I guess I'm down to my last
cry.  
  
I was here, you were there, guess we never could agree.  
While the sun shines on you, I need some love to rain on me.  
Still I sit all alone, wishing all my feelings were gone.  
Gotta get over you, nothing for me to do...  
  
Chorus:  
But have one last cry, one last cry, before I leave it all behind. I got to
put you out of my mind, this time, believe a lie, I know I've gotta be strong,
cause 'round me life goes on and on, and on and on... Ohh..  
  
I'm gonna dry my eyes, right after I get my..  
  
Chorus:  
One last cry, one last cry, before I leave it all behind, I got to put you out
of my mind for the very last time, believe a lie, I guess I'm down, I guess
I'm down, I guess I'm down, to my last cry.

Over time, I've been building my castle of love, oh  
Just for two  
Though you never knew you were my reason  
I've gone much too far for you now to say  
That I've got to throw my castle away  
Over dreams  
Over dreams  
I have picked out a perfect come true  
Though you never knew it was of you  
I've been dreaming  
The sandman has come from too far away  
For you to say come back some other day  
And though you don't believe that they do  
They do come true  
For did my dreams  
Come true when I looked at you  
And maybe too, if you would believe  
You too might be  
Overjoyed, over loved, over me  
Overjoyed, over loved, over me  
And though the odds say improbable  
What do they know  
For in romance  
All true love needs is a chance  
And maybe with a chance you will find  
You too like I  
Overjoyed, over loved, over you  
Overjoyed, over loved, over me

It's tearin' up my heart when I'm with you  
But when we are apart I feel it too  
And no matter what I do I feel the pain  
With or without you  
Baby I don't understand  
Just why we can't be lovers  
Things are gettin' out of hand  
Tryin' too much but baby we can't win  
Let it go  
If you want me girl let me know  
I am down on my knees  
I can't take it anymore  
  
Baby don't misunderstand  
What I'm tryin' to tell ya  
In the corner of my mind  
Baby it feels like we're running out of time  
Let it go  
If you want me girl let me know  
I am down on my knees  
I can't take it anymore  
  
Tearin' up my heart and soul  
We're apart I feel it too  
and no matter what I do I feel the pain  
with or without you  
Tearin' up my heart and soul  
We're apart I feel it too  
and no matter what I do I feel the pain  
with or with out you  
It's tearin up my heart when I'm with you  
(Tearin' up my heart and soul)  
But when we are apart I feel it too  
(We're apart I feel it too)  
And no matter what I do I feel the pain  
With or without you  
And no matter what I do I feel the pain  
With or without you

Oh oh  
Hold on  
Ah you know what?  
Can we back it up just a little bit?  
(Rewinding noises, various vocal sounds)  
  
I said why,  
I said why, (why)...  
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me...  
Oh, oh, yeah...  
We were born the same day  
We even think the same way  
It couldn't be more right  
We are what they call a perfect match  
It's something that you can't touch  
Down to the last bone, you're my baby  
But to be honest  
There's just one thing  
A part that is missin'  
You don't seem to care at all  
  
Tell me, tell me, baby  
How come you don't wanna love me  
Don't you know that I can't breathe without you  
Tell me, tell me, just how  
What am I supposed to do right now  
Why can't you love me?  
Why-y, tell me, my baby  
  
Now from the moment we met  
I thought that I was all set  
How could I be so wrong  
Now I'm hearing that you're seeing someone new  
And I wanna know who  
But does he love you love like I do?  
You're my baby  
But I promise you this one thing  
Whatever that's missing  
I will make it up to you  
So tell me baby  
  
Tell me, tell me, baby  
How come you don't wanna love me  
Don't you know that I can't breathe without you  
Tell me, tell me, just how  
What am I supposed to do right now  
Why can't you love me?  
Why-y, tell me, my baby  
  
You're getting under my skin  
You're messing up with my mind  
You're never letting me into your life  
Tell me baby how come you don't you wanna love me  
And am I supposed to live without?  
If there is no way to make you feel the same way too  
Oh you...  
  
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me  
  
We were born the same day  
We even think the same way  
We are what they all call a perfect match  
Tell me baby  
  
How come you don't wanna love me  
Don't you know that I can't breathe without you  
Tell me, tell me, just how  
What am I supposed to do right now?  
Why can't you love me?  
  
Tell me, baby  
Tell me, tell me, baby  
How come you don't wanna love me  
Don't you know that I can't breathe without you  
Tell me, tell me, just how  
What am I supposed to do right now  
Why can't you love me?  
  
Why-y, tell me, my baby  
Tell me, tell me, tell me, why  
Tell me, tell me, tell me, yeah  
Tell me, tell me, tell me... Yeah  
I said, tell, me, baby.  
Tell me, tell me, tell me, yeah,  
Tell me, tell me, tell me, yeah.

That girl will never be mine  
First time  
I saw her at the front door  
That girl  
Her face on every billboard  
Hands down  
You won't believe the way she laid her eyes on me  
Six feet  
What was I thought I got I'd get for  
So fly  
We got into a small talk  
Too bad  
She had to move along  
One smile and she was gone  
  
Can't explain  
I never thought that I was gonna loose my head  
Call me insane  
There's got to be a way  
  
How can I get next to her?  
Now, tell me how it's gonna be done  
Will I win or lose this one?  
Don't care about the fact  
She's in a different league  
They say it's no use that I try  
That girl will never be mine  
  
Next thing  
She's livin' in my TV  
And that girl  
Is stealin' every daydream  
Tough love  
She had to be the one for me  
When I just sing away  
Last night ran into a big thing  
Guess what  
She didn't want to see me  
They said I was outta line  
Who's wrong, who's right this time?  
  
Can't explain  
I never thought that I was gonna lose my head  
Call me insane  
There's got to be a way  
  
How can I get next to her?  
Now, tell me how it's gonna be done  
Will I win or lose this one?  
Don't care about the fact  
She's in a different league  
They say it's no use that I try  
That girl will never be mine  
  
That girl  
Is freakin' me out  
Don't care about the fact  
That she's all that  
That girl  
Is pullin' out the down  
There's no way for me to stop  
  
That girl  
Tearin' up the big screen  
That girl  
Stealin' every daydream  
Tough love  
She had to be the one for me  
She will be mine  
No matter what they try to say  
There's got to be a way  
  
How can I get next to her?  
Now, tell me how it's gonna be done  
Will I win or lose this one?  
Don't care about the fact  
She's in a different league  
They say it's no use that I try  
They say it's no use that I try  
That girl will never be mine

Sunday morning time to say goodbye  
But I'll be holding you soon  
Though I'm leavin', girl don't start to cry  
I'll be thinkin' of you.... Yeah  
It's a lonely ride on the midnight train  
I'm countin' down the days 'til I'm home again  
How can I say when my words ever dry  
How can I smile with the tear in my eye  
Summer's so lost with rainin' in June  
That's how it feels when I'm missin' you  
Oh yeah, baby, oooh

Another week come by  
Girl it feels like years, hmmm...

How I wish you were here, ooh yeah..  
It's a lonely ride on the midnight train  
I'm countin' down the days 'til I'm home again  
How can I say when my words ever dry  
How can I smile with the tear in my eye  
Summer's so lost with rainin' in June  
That's how it feels when I'm missin' you  
I never met a girl who is so this sweet  
Can't wait to see you again, oohh

And you know that I'll be dreamin' 'til then  
Oooooh, baby...

Summer's so lost when it's rainin' in June(aaahhh)  
That's how it feels (that's how it feels)  
When I'm missing you

When you wish upon a star  
Makes no difference who you are  
Anything your heart desires  
Will come to you  
  
If your heart is in your dream  
No request is too extreme  
When you wish upon a star  
As dreamers do  
  
Fate is kind  
She brings to those who love  
The sweet fulfillment of  
Their secret longing  
  
Like a bolt out of the blue  
Fate steps in and sees you through  
When you wish upon a star  
Your dreams come true!

Oh, right now baby  
As soon as the stars shine  
I'm gonna make you mine, oh baby  
  
(You got it, I want it)  
(I'll do whatever it takes)  
(You got it, I need it)  
(Your love is what makes my heart break)  
  
Let me tell you how I feel  
I need your lovin' girl, give it to me  
Never met a girl like you  
I know you'll like the crazy things we'll do  
(The crazy thing we'll do)  
  
Walking slowly through the rain  
Without worries there's no pain  
When you see a shooting star  
All your problems seem so far  
If you feel true love and trust  
Girl just give me all you got  
'Cause girl you got the love I need  
  
(You got it, I want it)  
(I'll do whatever it takes)  
Whatever it takes  
(You got it, I need it)  
You got it, I need it  
(Your love is what makes my heart break)  
  
You are in my dreams at night  
Whatever I do, you're always on my mind  
I can't wait until the day  
When you and me are one in love to stay  
  
Walking slowly through the rain  
Without worries there's no pain  
When you see a shooting star  
All your problems seem so far  
If you feel true love and trust  
Girl, just give me all you've got  
Girl you got the love I need
