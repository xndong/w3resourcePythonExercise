Electric eel  
Swimming through the seas of the unreal  
Trying to land a deal for you to reinvent the wheel  
Electric eel  
  
Electric eye  
Pull the plug, watch him die  
I did not even cry, I guess you know the reasons why  
Electric eye  
  
Was I supposed to go down with the ship?  
I was not the captain, it was not my trip  
Sailing to the moon with Aliice the goon  
Oh yeah!  
  
I'm Popeye the sailor man  
I live in a garbage can!  
Oh maybe you got it, take it away

I'm not gonna give it up for free anymore  
And I don't really care if you label me a whore  
Frayed at the edges, busted at the seams  
I can walk with a song, sleep with my dreams  
  
You can cover up your chains, and call yourself free  
It doesn't really matter,  
It's all the same to me  
  
You're the new newest thing and we've seen it all before  
In fact I've seen it many times and I'll see it many more  
You know it won't last, you know it never does  
But better to be a has-been than to be a never-was  
You can get out with it clean or prolong the agony  
Which ever you prefer,  
It's all the same to me  
  
You worship the future like it's some kind of saint  
But it's just like the past with a new coat of paint  
Try to save a world that doesn't want to be saved  
Stolen like a child, the one you think is misbehaved  
You can say what you want or say what you see  
You can say nothing, its all the same to me

Back the fuck away from it and leave it where it lies  
How many stabbings can it take before it dies  
I got the message like a bullet to the head  
No wishful thinking now to help bring back the dead  
  
I never noticed as you turned into a ghost  
You couldn't help me when I needed you the most  
You made your choice, you would not change your course  
I got a lesson how to flog a dying horse  
  
On Easter I got a chocolate rabbit  
Biggest one I ever had  
You never know 'till you've bitten off their head  
If they're hollow and the chocolate's bad

Wizard's kiss, dragon's breath  
Pot of gold payable on death  
  
You think you're on the winning team  
But it's no game, though it just might be a dream  
  
Highest hill to lowest pit  
If you ain't got love, you ain't got shit  
'Cause it's your life to live or to lose  
I'm tired of singing the death culture blues!  
  
Now we're told just to get in line  
And bowo down the almighty dollar sign  
Battle turns from left to right  
But I'm not going down without a fight  
  
I've done my time, I took my bath  
I'm back on track down the shining pathy  
'Cause it's your life to live or to lose  
I've tired of singing the death culture blues!

Warms you up inside  
Soothes your wounded pride  
But your gold turns to lead  
As it goes to your head  
And you cry  
Drunken tears once again, my friend  
  
So what if you're not the genius  
You always thought you were?  
Nobody hears the brilliant words  
Between your ears  
And you cry  
Drunken tears once again, my friend  
  
Here's some ancient truth  
Dredged up from your youth  
A voice from way back when  
Long lost love that might have been  
And you cry  
Drunken tears once again, my friend  
  
Go ahead, I don't mind your drunken tears

It's raining, It's raining.  
  
There is nothing you can do  
It doesn't only rain on you  
But you're acting all upset like you're the only one who is wet.  
  
It's raining, It's raining.  
  
There is nothing we can do  
Its raining on me too  
You moan and you cry  
But it won't effect the sky.  
  
You're not a saint  
You're not a savior  
Or a devil  
Its agreed  
Oh lucky you oh lucky me  
We have more of those than we need.  
  
And when you give me gifts and money  
I'm a swine before the pearl  
It only serves to remind me that we are all alone in this world.  
  
It's raining, It's raining,  
  
And I can't tell you when the storm is gonna end  
So go ahead and cry but that won't keep you dry.

What was yours to give  
Was also yours to sell  
There's the haystack  
Can you spin it into gold?  
  
Halo on your head  
A tail and cloven hoof  
You set sail upon a sea of open wallet  
  
And when you're played out  
You'll coast for miles  
Fueled by smiles  
  
You run in circles  
With industry professionals  
You climb the ladder  
That leads you to the temple gates  
The evil god there will welcome you with open arms  
  
What was yours to give  
Was also yours to sell  
But where's the haystack now?  
And where's the pot of gold?

You never cried, you never froze  
And yet how well your garden grows -  
You reap the fruits another sows:  
I guess that works out well for you.  
Suffering has served you well -  
It's common but it somehow sells  
So sing your little songs of hell and sell.  
Hollow hopes and empty dreams  
And blind pursuit of worthless schemes -  
That's all there is to life, it seems,  
unless you prove me wrong - please do!

Repair the hull, replace the sails.  
The monkey wrestles with the ghost  
And a thousand pleasures form a thin veneer  
Over lack of hope.  
The captain was rightly murdered by the crew  
But now they don't know what to do -  
Drifting on the murky Sargasso of the everyday.  
Work and slave and skimp and save  
And you can buy yourself a bigger cave  
And a thousand little cruelties we agree to pretend to ignore.  
The ghost has got the monkey by the tail  
And all they both can do is wail.  
And you and I go drifting by the abandoned vessels of he everyday.

Common as the cold  
Up for sale, never sold  
Getting older and it shows  
Your disappointment only grows  
And no one seems to care  
That you never got your share  
Who said life was fair?  
So smile - it's not so bad  
You lost your health  
Never had no wealth  
So tighten up your belt  
As you gather dust upon some shelf  
  
You lost by just a nose  
But there's no prize for place or show  
Now, at least, you know  
So smile - it's not so bad  
Tired out and broken down  
You've played the field and made the rounds  
Now you're stuck in this one-horse town  
Your only solace is the sound of melody and verse  
Though your bag's about to burst  
Others have it worse  
So smile - it's not so bad

Everyday we earn our meager pay  
But it takes its toll to play the happy prole.  
The buy your labor, try to steal your soul -  
Bite the bullet, hold your tongue and play the happy prole.  
Paranoid and tired - quit before you're fired.  
But they've got you in the hole, so you play happy prole.  
You need the money so you got to play it dumb,  
but if you play it long enough it's just what you become.  
Pay your rent, pay your bills, pay the doctor for your pills  
So you can work another day, as life slips away.

The Jig is Up  
We're throwing our clocks out the window  
Make for high ground  
And watch the sun's blood over mexico  
Come back kid forget what you did  
Forget where you've been  
My poor long lost twin  
Long lost twin  
  
We kick through the shards  
Of the white plastic domes of the moneymen  
The dust of the stars and the burned out controls of the mind-machine  
Day bears the nights night bulls the day  
It just don't seem right to just piss it away  
Piss it away

You only hurt the one you love  
That may be true  
But better said, you only hurt the one who loves you  
  
We went through hell  
Just to get to hell  
Die of thirst of drink up form the poisoned well  
  
I kept the things inside  
At least I never lied  
I'm not trying to document my suicide  
  
You won't live long  
But you may write the perfect song  
Please excuse those who choose to not play along

You've left at last, I knew you could  
Leaving nothing to remember you by  
Except how to be happy  
And how not to care any more  
  
Two by two, these things weren't meant for you  
  
Your call never came, I wish that it would,  
So I could have something to remember you by  
Besides the way we fell to pieces  
And how not to feel anything  
  
Two by two, these things weren't meant for you  
  
It rains today, or are those tears  
Falling from the moon above  
That bell in my head  
It'll ring 'til I'm dead.

When you told me if you can't beat 'em, join 'em  
I was thinking death before dishonor  
As you lord over your front porch  
Getting drunk with your neighbor  
Well I might wander all day  
Across the Milky Way  
But I'll be Joan of Arc when the going gets dark  
  
Why buy a trip across the ocean  
When you could already be the sea?  
  
And they'll tell you sign up with the winning team  
Or get out of the way, get with the program  
Welcome to the real world!  
Is that what is real  
Or is it just that the standard deal?  
You can have all of that  
That ain't where it's at  
  
Why buy a trip across the ocean  
When you could already be the sea?

You fucked yourself  
And you don't know where to go  
Split wide open like a sturgeon for the row  
Blood was splashed on pure white snow  
  
You fucked yourself  
And you're looking for the go  
Drown in your sink  
Condemned if you float  
You placed the blame but missed the boat  
  
You fucked yourself  
You chose your fate  
You changed your mind  
When it's too late  
Your self-deceit, your worst mistake
