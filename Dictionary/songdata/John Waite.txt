Honey you do me wrong  
But I'm still crazy about you  
Stay away too long  
When you know I can't do without you  
Every chance you get you seem to  
Hurt me more and more and more  
But each hurt makes my love  
Stronger than before  
I know flowers grow from rain  
But how can love  
Grow from this pain  
I want to know  
Ain't that peculiar  
Peculiarity  
Ain't that peculiar baby  
Ain't it just like you and me  
Aw you tell me lies  
And you should be honest to me  
Me I'm so much in love with you baby  
That I don't want to see  
That the things you do and say  
Are designed to make me blue  
It's a crying shame  
My love for you  
Makes all your lies seem true  
If the truth makes love last longer  
Why do lies make my love stronger  
I want to know right now  
Ain't that peculiar  
Peculiarity  
Ain't that peculiar baby  
Ain't it just like you and me  
Yeah  
Uh huh  
Ah ah yeah  
All right  
Yeah  
Ain't that peculiar  
Peculiarity  
Ain't that peculiar baby  
Ain't it just like you and me  
Ain't that peculiar  
Peculiarity right now  
Yeah  
I want to know right now  
Why it means that much to you and me  
My poor heart's going to break  
I'm making a big mistake  
Making my poor heart break  
Making me give her a double take  
Making my poor heart break  
Making me give her a double take  
I could change your world  
I could  
You could and I could  
I will  
Change your world  
(you can I can change our world)  
(you can I can change our world)  
(you can I can change our world)  
(you can I can change our world)  
(you can I can change our world)  
(you can I can change our world)

Well I stood by the streetlight  
And I whispered your name  
To the circle of darkness again  
In the mercury night  
The snow fell like cocaine  
But all I want for Christmas is you  
I'd been out with some good friends  
And we raised a glass or two  
It's the time of the year to get loose  
Like a dog on the freeway  
With the headlights in my eyes  
All I get from you is the truth  
I don't need a new Cadillac  
Or a new set of clothes  
Just Donner and Blitzen  
To bring me fresh mistletoe  
And make my world  
A world  
Where love don't get old  
Cause all I want for Christmas is you  
Well I stand in the spotlight  
But it's always royal blue  
And It won't bring you back here  
That's true  
I got my name in lights  
Strung out on the avenue  
And all I want for Christmas is you  
I don't need a new Cadillac  
Or a new suit of clothes  
Just Donner and Blitzen  
To bring me fresh mistletoe  
And make my world  
A world  
Where love don't get old  
Cause all I want for Christmas is you  
All I want for Christmas is you  
Yeah  
All I want for Christmas is you  
Yeah baby

Well, September comes around like an old familiar friend  
So I take off to Central Park to watch those falling leaves again  
And in the arbors of Strawberry Fields, in a night as bright as day  
I look up at the sky and wish I could fly away  
And I say I know this life won't last forever  
But wherever you go these days  
I'm with you all the way  
And I say I know your time and mine together  
Is more than I could understand  
But I promise you, I'll always be your man  
And so I watch those falling leaves until the winter kicks in good  
Until I reach the same conclusion, we never say the things we should  
You're with me all the time it seems, yeah, these days I'm not alone  
I can't explain the things I'm going through, it's you not me that's flown
away  
And I say I know this time won't last forever  
But wherever you go these days  
I'm with you all the way  
And I say I know your time and mine together  
Is more than I could understand  
But I promise you, I'll always be your man  
And time has put us through some heavy changes  
And I say I still care about you and I know what love's for  
And I'll be right here waiting for you every day  
To come in laughing through that door  
Look up at the towers through the falling snow  
It's hard to tell what you've been going through  
Because I'm a stranger now in your world  
And I say I know this world won't last forever  
But wherever you go these days  
I'm with you all the way  
And I say I know your time and mine together  
Is more than I could understand  
But I promise you, I'll always be your man  
Day in day out, I have no doubt  
I'll always be your man  
  

I was so lonely until I met you  
Told myself I'd get by without love  
Drownin' my sorrows  
Avoiding tomorrows  
  
Kind of felt that I just had enough  
You light up my face with your jokes and your smiles  
And the way that you came here tonight  
Don't know what you got  
  
But I'm sure glad I found you  
Could be wrong but it sure feels right  
And here I am  
I'm back on my feet again  
  
Here I am  
I'm back on my feet again  
Surprised at myself  
for the way that I feel  
  
So happy that you're  
here with me  
Some women I've known  
They've left me with nothing  
  
But I guess that was just meant to be  
And here I am  
I'm back on my feet again  
Here I am  
  
I'm back on my feet again  
I was down for the count  
I was down  
I was beat  
  
I was cryin'  
I was cornered and hurt  
I was hidin' my face  
Sittin' there cryin'  
  
I was so lonely until I met you  
Told myself I'd get by without love  
Drownin' my sorrows  
Avoiding tomorrows  
  
Kind of felt that I just had enough  
And here I am  
I'm back on my feet again  
Here I am  
  
I'm back on my feet again.  
Yes here I am  
I'm back on my feet again  
Here I am  
  
I'm back on my feet again

I heard that she's back in town  
Heard she's been seen around  
I hear she gets  
What she wants everytime  
  
I know what she put you through  
I know what you'd like to do  
'Cause I lost my heart  
To her sometime ago  
  
So come on  
Wipe your tears away  
It's all that you can do  
A broken heart never mends  
  
Crying tears til the very end  
At home on the boulevard  
Cheap whiskey and tarot cards  
Man she's outrageous  
  
She wants the best in life  
Sugar daddies with agin' wives  
She's expensive everything she does  
So come on  
  
Wipe your tears away  
It's all that you can do  
A broken heart never mends  
Crying tears til the very end  
  
She knows what it must be like  
Living in paradise  
If you ain't got money she don't want to know  
I know what she put you through  
  
I know what you'd like to do  
I lost my heart to her sometime ago  
So come on  
Wipe your tears away  
  
It's all that you can do  
When you've got a broken heart  
Come on  
Wipe your tears away  
  
It's all that you can do  
Oh yeah

You always give me something  
To help me understand  
Turn those tracks around me one more time  
But all you give is killing me  
  
I can't turn around  
I'm gettin' loaded on a darker side of town  
I don't know who I am on a darker side of town  
I came to win some game I played  
  
When I was just a boy  
I've done too much have nothing in my life  
I understood the rules back then  
Now I can't decide  
  
I'm gettin' loaded on a darker side of town  
I'm gettin' wasted on a darker side of town  
Oh I give to you everything I've got  
Even start again to make you smile yeah  
  
But my luck's run out  
My head is burned  
I can't turn around  
I'm gettin' loaded on a darker side of town  
  
I'm drownin' in some wine on a darker side of town  
Darker side of town

No guardian angel looking down on me tonight  
I'm on the streets again  
And I can't tell wrong from right  
I'm on the run from love  
But I don't know what I'm running for  
But it all looks alright when I'm standing at your door  
This could be ecstasy  
I've been dreaming of you  
This could be reality  
Tonight tonight  
Desperate love  
Got no reflection in the mirror anymore  
I'm falling backwards  
But I never hit the floor  
Don't give me counterfeits  
I need the real thing  
This ain't a game no more  
I'm bettin' everything  
This could be ecstasy  
I've been dreaming of you  
This could be reality  
Tonight tonight  
Desperate love  
Yeah desperate love  
I don't feel I should fight  
When you pull me through your door  
You take me to your room  
And show me what I'm living for  
And I lose myself  
But my heart keeps poundin'  
If you won't take me now  
Don't take me anymore  
Cause I don't read books  
But I know the score  
This could be ecstacy  
I've been dreaming of you  
This could be reality tonight  
You could be next to me  
I've been waiting for you  
This could be reality tonight  
Yeah  
I don't feel I should fight  
When you pull me through your door  
You take me to your room  
And show me what I'm living for  
And I lose myself  
But my heart keeps poundin'  
If you won't take me now  
Don't take me anymore  
Cause I don't need books  
To know the score  
You could be next to me  
I've been dreaming of you  
This could be ecstasy  
Tonight tonight  
Desperate love  
Yeah  
Desperate love  
Desperate love  
Yeah desperate love  
Ooh yeah  
Desperate love  
Desperate desperate love  
Desperate desperate love  
Love  
It's desperate desperate love

You tell me to be strong  
You tell me to be strong  
Goodbye ain't no reason to cry  
It ain't no big deal  
You say I'll get along  
Sure I'll get along  
You're so nonchalant  
That it's unreal  
Well I thought this love would be all I needed  
I thought this love was something to believe in  
Now you, you say sorry babe  
It didn't work out that way  
But don't let that ruin your day  
Don't lose any sleep now babe  
It's just my heart you're breaking  
Just my world your taking away  
Don't lose any sleep now babe  
Don't you worry about me  
No don't worry babe  
I'll be alright  
Whoa yeah  
Don't act so concerned  
No don't be concerned  
Don't know how much more  
Of your kindness that I can bear  
Guess I had to learn  
I just had to learn  
That after all this  
You just don't care  
But don't let that worry your mind now  
I'll be OK  
Baby I'll be fine now  
It's just I'm watching my world walking away  
Don't lose any sleep now babe  
It's just my heart you're breaking  
Just my world your taking away  
Don't lose any sleep now babe  
Don't you worry about me

No don't worry baby  
It's just my heart you're breaking  
(Can't you see it's breaking baby)  
Don't lose any sleep now baby

I wait for sundown on the fire escape  
And watch the passing cars downstairs  
I'm high above Korean groceries  
A sublet castle in the air  
  
It's down to cigarettes and rosaries  
Christ, I wish someone would call me  
Johnny Thunders on the radio  
Ah but "you can't put your arms  
  
Around a memory"  
Maybe I could find a better way  
But all I need is to feel connected now  
Do you remember me  
  
I sang that song you like  
I sang that song for free  
Now someone else sounds like me  
As I make my way downtown  
  
Downtown  
Oh yeah  
Downtown  
See the old men on the Bowery  
  
Take the night train to the stars  
You can find me in the usual place  
Inside the Temple Bar  
I hear that Sally's got a gift for me  
  
I hear she found it on St. Mark's  
These days they all just talk like poetry  
And shoot their mouths off shooting sparks  
Maybe I could find a better way  
  
But all I need now is to feel connected  
Do you remember me  
I sang that song you like  
Way back in eighty-three  
  
Number one  
High as a kite  
As I made my way downtown  
Downtown  
  
Oh yeah  
Downtown  
They've got paper cups for charity  
Kools, pills and broken teeth, and dope  
  
But I'll take another dry martini  
And a chance on hope  
And now someone else waits for me  
And I got to get downtown  
  
Downtown  
Oh yeah  
Downtown  
I'm going way downtown  
  
Oh yeah  
I'm gonna see the man  
I'm going way downtown  
See the man  
  
Going down yeah  
I'm gonna see the man  
Going downtown  
Do you remember me

In these days of wild roses  
I held a compass in my hand  
I had three wishes for a future  
That I won't need to understand  
  
And I've got holly green on blood red  
Manhattan Christmas on my arm  
My soul ain't worth saving  
Feels like I've lost my lucky charm  
  
And I've been living in the gutter  
I've been loaded like a gun  
I've been sliding down the mountain  
And it feels like kingdom come  
  
And I'm always fighting windmills  
Have to take it as it comes  
See I'm  
I'm encircled  
  
I am  
If you want me tell me  
'Cause I can't play this game much longer  
Feels a lot like oblivion  
  
This feeling just keeps getting stronger  
And I've been living in the gutter  
Without American Express  
Heroes changing horses midstream  
  
I'm detached  
I'm second-guessed  
Won't you please come back and get me  
My whole world is in a mess  
  
See I'm  
I'm encircled  
This time I am  
I'm encircled  
  
In these days of wild roses  
I'm encircled  
Yeah  
And I've been living in the gutter  
  
I've been loaded like a gun  
I've been sliding down the mountain  
And it feels like kingdom come  
And I'm always fighting windmills  
  
Have to take it as it comes  
See I'm encircled  
This time I am  
I'm encircled  
  
I am  
In these days of wild roses

Storm warning on the radio  
Flags and banners  
Armageddon on the late night show  
And like my father before  
We've got love on the barricades  
Sweethearts who miss  
Battle hymns and hit parades  
Armageddon cascades  
What's my name  
Jack of spades  
Outside my window  
Is darkness and rain  
And I'm only dreaming  
Til the sun shines again  
Got nothing but a uniform  
General issue and rules that I will warn  
On my name tags are sewn  
Serial number stamped across my name  
My fate is decided by kangaroo court  
It's insane  
Tin soldiers marching in flame  
What's my name  
Jack of spades  
Outside my window  
Is darkness and rain  
And I'm only dreaming  
Until the sun shines again  
There's no phoenix rising  
And the future's stillborn  
Dark shadows are dancing  
My coat of colors is torn  
In Euro  
Yeah, oh.  
Supernova on the Baltic Sea  
Push button logic dehumanizing me  
And it gets a lot like TV  
We've got children starving in the streets  
Genocide's the fashion  
And no man withstands its heat  
Kings and pawns all compete  
First gets the oil and the gold  
Outside my window  
Clouds fill my sky  
And I'm only dreaming  
That there's still time to turn the tide  
There's no phoenix rising  
And the future's stillborn  
Dark shadows are dancing  
My coat of colors is torn  
In Euroshima  
Oh no  
Euro  
Euroshima  
Oh no  
Euro

I spend my time  
Thinkin' 'bout you constantly  
It's true that I want you  
You're the meaning of success to me  
Cause anything you want  
You can get from me  
Don't try to work it out  
Just let it be  
Emotion has no price  
And love is free  
I've been going round in circles  
You're always on my mind  
I need you so bad  
It's driving me out of my mind  
Reflected in your eyes  
Can't you see  
You and I against the world  
Young lions roam free  
You're always taking me somewhere  
That I've never seen  
No matter where you go  
I'm with you  
Every step of the way  
No matter what you need  
I've got more every single day  
My heart is full for you  
And I'm longing to find you  
Every step of the way  
I'm with you  
Every step of the way  
I'm right beside you  
Cause anything you want  
You can get from me  
Don't try to work it out  
Just let it be  
Emotion has no price  
And love is free  
It's free and no matter where you go  
I'm with you  
Every step of the way  
No matter what you need  
I've got more every single day  
My heart is full for you  
In your shadow you'll find me  
Every step of the way  
I'm with you  
Every step of the way  
I'm right beside you  
No matter what you do  
No matter what you say  
I'm right beside you  
Every single day  
No matter what you do  
Or who you do it to  
No matter where you've been  
No matter what you say  
Or who you say it to  
No matter what you do  
I will stay close to you  
Every step of the way  
Every single day  
Every step of the way

I've been watching you, watching me  
Can't you tell what I'm going through?  
I wanna hold your fire, wanna get you higher  
Think of the things we'll do  
You put it out there, then you take it back  
You treat me like I'm your toy  
You know exactly what you're doing, just another heart in ruin  
But I just wanna be your boy  
  
It's evil, when something's so bad makes you feel this good  
It's evil, alright, it's in my blood and it feels like it should  
  
Start to feel the rush of the thoughtful time  
Moonlight's kicking in the door  
Stay awake and keep it roar  
Go all night and got before, you're beautiful  
  
I'm gonna take you on a drive around Central Park  
Buy you some real good french wine  
I'll treat you like a queen, you got a spell on me  
It's a voodoo kind of thing  
  
It's evil, when something's so bad makes you feel this good  
It's evil, alright, it's in my blood and it feels like it should  
  
She's so evil, way she walks into the room  
And I may not leave here alive  
And the evil, and the evil, and the evil, and the evil  
  
Don't you know it's evil  
When something's so bad makes you feel this good  
It's evil, alright  
It's in my blood and it feels like it should  
It's evil  
When something so bad makes you feel this good  
It's in my blood

For so long, you've gone on  
Trying to see an end to it all  
And I know, your grip is getting loose  
You think if you leave  
The pain will go away  
But you don't know  
You need it to get through  
'Cause I can tell by the things you say  
That your feelings will never change  
You'll keep coming back to what you know is true  
It's okay to want to be free  
It's okay to spread your wings  
If you know how to fly  
So for now, you go on  
Crawling along for a while  
But you're dragging me down  
You're holding me back  
You're making it end  
'Cause I can tell by the things you say  
That your feelings will never change  
You'll keep coming back to what you know is true  
Chorus  
You can fly  
Chorus  
It's okay to close your eyes  
It's okay to fade away  
If you don't want to stay  
'Cause you can fly  
You can fly

If you're traveling to north country fair  
Where the winds hits heavy on borderline  
Remember me to the one who lives there  
She once was a true love of mine  
Hope you see her hairs hanging long  
It flows and rolls all down her breast  
Please see for me that if her hair is hanging long  
Ohh that is the way I remember her best  
If you go when the snowflakes fall  
When the rivers freeze and summer ends  
See for me she has a coat so warm  
To keep her from the howling winds  
So if you're travelin' in the north country fair  
Where the winds hits heavy on the borderline  
Remember me the one who loves that  
She once was a true love, true love of mine  

No Krishna, Buddha, Jesus in my soul  
'Til the sun breaks through again  
Down into nothing as I lose myself  
In the perfections of Zen  
She said: I got the answer  
I said: I'm curious, can you write that down my friend  
It said there's nothing in the real world  
So why should we pretend zero?  
Godhead  
We got nothing  
We got everything  
I took a page out of Unpunished  
And I flew a paper plane  
But there is nothing in the real world  
But the cool, cool, cool of soul  
And I've got nothing in my pockets  
But lose change and gold zero!  
And I'm trying to get somewhere  
In a room with glow  
The church mice are singing now  
What John Lee Hooker knows  
Godhead  
We got nothing  
We got everything  
I'm falling backwards in her mirrored room  
In her mirrored room tonight  
She looks so good  
And I feel fine  
As she says we might make it to Godhead  
  

Saw you standing in the darkness  
With your back against the wall  
And your eyes looked kind of distant  
Then I knew you'd seen it all  
It was then that you betrayed me  
Cause I could see right through your gaze  
I guess you and I have seen much better days  
You used to be so taken  
With the lifestyle of the king  
Now you find love's everything  
You're going to the top  
You found somebody special  
Now your heart will never stop  
And you know I wish you well  
You could of been somebody a contender  
I guess that chance just passed you by  
Now you can't remember who to trust  
But I sure wish that you'd try  
And nothing gets you nothing  
And you get back what you give  
You can't hold out much longer  
It's time for you to live  
You used to be so taken  
With the lifestyle of the king  
Now you find love's everything  
You're going to the top  
You found somebody special  
Now your heart will never stop  
And you know I wish you well yeah  
You're going to the top  
You're falling up to heaven  
And now your heart will never stop  
And you know I wish you well yeah  
Good things are gonna find you  
Though somebody's got to pay  
You could always turn your back and walk  
But I sure wish that you'd stay  
You're going to the top  
You found somebody special  
Now your heart will never stop  
And you know I wish you well these days  
You're going to the top  
You're falling up to heaven  
And your heart ain't gonna stop  
And you know I wish you well these days  
You're going to the top  
You found somebody special  
And your heart will never stop  
And you know I wish you well these days  
You're going to the top  
And now you're someone special  
And I still think of you a lot  
And you know I wish you well  
Yeah

You spin around and turn on me  
Stop me in my crash  
You want to be somebody else  
Say you won't be back  
  
Your bourgeois friends call you dear  
Deal you like a card  
Your eyes out for the diamonds now  
Experienced and scarred  
  
You tell me gonna be somebody  
Gonna be okay  
Gonna be somebody someday  
You're moving through a different space  
  
Where I don't belong  
Elegance gold and silver  
Superficial grace  
They'll pervert you  
  
Masquerade you  
Pass evil as good taste  
They'll chew you up and spit you out  
And put you in your place  
  
You tell me gonna be somebody  
Gonna be okay  
Gonna be somebody someday  
Gonna be somebody  
  
Gonna be okay  
Gonna be somebody someday  
Gonna be somebody  
Gonna be okay  
  
Gonna be somebody someday  
Gonna be somebody  
Gonna be somebody  
Gonna be somebody someday

You quit the band and got a job  
Decided to take a wife  
Then you stood still  
And I went on  
  
And almost lost my life  
No I don't want to be in your shoes  
And I don't want to read local news  
And though I know we had the same views  
  
Who's the fool?  
Try and keep your head above the waves  
Try and tell yourself that you're safe  
I know you do your best to keep faith  
  
So round and round we go  
It's a shame  
Oh but you never know  
There you go praised again  
  
Your head pressed against the glass  
You always tried to put me down  
But I knew that it couldn't last  
Cause I don't want to be in your shoes  
  
And I don't want to read local news  
And though I know we had the same views  
Who's the fool  
Try 'n keep your head above the waves  
  
Try and tell yourself that you're safe  
I know you do your best to keep faith  
So try and keep your head above the waves  
Oh, feels so good  
  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
I knew it would  
Oh it just don't mean that much anymore oh

Well the first time that I saw ya  
You looked down and out  
And I had my doubts  
About you  
But baby since I've come to know ya

What it's about  
Me and baby  
We're going out tonight  
She's gonna treat me right

She fills my loving cup  
We're going head first  
Well the second time that I saw ya  
Man you'd really improved  
I was really moved  
How I wanted you  
I'm knocking at your door  
To see if you're alone tonight  
Cause I need some more  
Of what you got  
Me and baby  
We're going out tonight  
She's gonna treat me right  
Ooh yeah

She fills my loving cup  
We're going head first

It's gonna be alright  
Me and baby  
We're gonna rock and roll  
We're gonna rip it up  
We're fallin' head first

In this world of right and wrong  
The hardest part is beginning  
By the time you find  
where you belong  
  
You're either losing or winning  
Well I don't know how  
But people seem to know  
When you want somebody  
  
bad enough  
Well I want you now  
and wherever you go  
I'm gonna love ya till  
  
you've had enough cause  
If everyone had a heart  
Yours would never be broken  
If anybody had a heart like mine  
  
People treat you like  
the clothes you wear  
They only see what you show them  
Let them talk baby I don't care  
  
They don't know where we're goin'  
I love you so much  
And I have for so long  
How could anybody doubt it  
  
Oh just one little touch  
This love is so strong  
Baby how can we live without it  
If everyone had a heart  
  
Yours would never be broken  
If anybody had a heart like mine  
When you love somebody  
You may stumble you may fall  
  
But if you love somebody hard enough  
Maybe you can get it all  
If everyone had a heart  
Yours would never be broken  
  
If anybody had a heart like mine  
Anybody in the world  
If everyone had a heart  
Yours would never be broken  
  
If anybody had a heart like mine  
If anybody had a heart  
If everyone had a heart  
Yours would never be broken  
  
If anybody had a heart like mine  
If anybody had a heart  
If everyone had a heart

If I say I love ya  
And lay it on the line  
Yeah  
Could you say you need me  
  
And put your hands in mine  
Oh I got love that grows  
Oh I got love that shows  
I got the love  
  
If you've got the time  
Then I've got the time  
Do you say you want me  
You'll give me everything  
  
Then you could come live here  
I'd even buy a ring  
Oh I've got lots to learn  
Oh I've got love to burn  
  
I got the love  
If you've got the time  
Oh I've got love that shows  
Oh I've got love that grows  
  
I got the love  
If you've got the time  
Then I've got the time  
Yeah  
  
Do you say you need me  
You'll give me everything  
Then you could come live here  
I'd even buy a ring  
  
Oh I've got love that shows  
Oh I've got love that grows  
I got the love  
If you've got the time  
  
Then I've got the time  
Oh I've got love that shows  
Oh I've got love that grows  
I got the love  
  
If you've got the time  
Then I've got the time  
Oh I've got love that shows  
Oh I've got love that grows  
  
I've got the love

Hear the lonesome whippoorwill  
He sounds too blue to fly  
The midnight train is whining low  
I'm so lonesome I could cry  
  
I've never seen a night so long  
When time goes crawling by  
The moon just went behind a cloud  
To hide its face and cry  
  
Did you ever see a robin weep  
When leaves begin to die  
That means he's lost his will to live  
And I'm so lonesome I could cry  
  
The silence of a falling star  
Lights up a purple sky  
As I wonder where you could be tonight  
I'm so lonesome I could cry  
  
Oh I'm so lonesome I could cry  
Oh I'm so lonesome I could cry

Do you think you have to act  
Like you're someone else with me  
Like a cover girl  
Or a barbie doll  
  
Or a beauty queen  
You'll be gone when I wake up  
To the Rolling Stones  
And the jukes and earls  
  
But I ain't looking for  
An imaginary girl  
Who are you really?  
Come on tell me  
  
Deep behind blue eyes  
And what's on today's agenda  
In your enterprise  
Do you weigh the odds before you speak  
  
Straighten out your curls  
But I'm not taken in  
By an imaginary girl  
Yeah  
  
Who are you trying to be  
Why are you so counterfeit  
What's your problem  
Who do you want to be anyway  
  
'Cause I need reality  
That's right  
Come on be straight with me  
You're like a damaged nerve  
  
You're like a dirt road curve  
Do you think you have to act  
Like your someone else with me  
'Cause I don't believe you  
  
You're an imaginary girl  
Don't believe you babe  
Thought I saw you once  
When you just let go  
  
And took your heart down off the shelf  
When you turned around and looked at me baby  
You were nobody else  
That's what I'm looking for deep inside of you  
  
That hidden precious pearl  
Not the act of love  
From an imaginary girl  
I can't buy into your imaginary world  
  
Yeah  
Won't be taken in  
By an imaginary girl  
So who are you saving it for  
  
In your imaginary world  
Yeah  
I guess I'm resigned to an imaginary girl  
I'm in love with an imaginary girl

We speak out like children  
Of the dreams that we chase and pursue  
These rights we hold precious  
Say it loud enough  
And it'll be true  
In the company of strangers  
Wild conversation  
And the hours go by so fast  
And you find a lot of wisdom there  
At the bottom of the glass  
But when the lights go down  
And the laughter fades away  
Somewhere beneath the moon and stars  
All of life certainties they  
They all just slip away  
And you lie down in God's shadow  
At the end  
The end of the day  
We speak revolution  
But the future's already been sold  
The masters of diffusion  
Spinning their fine webs into gold  
And the party's just begun  
This matter of resistance  
Our ship was built to last  
We're sailing out on troubled seas  
Nail your colors to the mast  
But when the lights go down  
And the laughter fades away  
Somewhere beneath the moon and stars  
All of life certainties they  
They all just slip away  
And you lie down in God's shadow  
At the end  
The end of the day  
The avenue is so crowded  
And they're turning up the heat  
And the red lights keep on flashing  
Out there tonight on Bourbon Street  
On Bourbon Street  
Wild conversation  
And the hours go by so fast  
And you find a lot of wisdom there  
At the bottom of the glass  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
But when the lights go down  
And the laughter fades away  
Somewhere beneath the moon and stars  
All of life certainties they  
They all just slip away  
And you lie down in God's shadow  
At the end  
The end of the day  
The end of the day  
The end of the day  
The end of the day  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Lay down your soul with me  
Lay down your soul tonight  
Lay down your soul with me  
And everything will be alright  
It'll be alright

Give me something I can touch with my hands  
Something I can look at and understand  
If you're up there no don't look down on me  
Do something quick I can't pay the rent  
  
Do you believe in Jesus  
Is he there  
Is there a God above  
And does he really care  
  
Oh yeah  
Jesus are you there  
And do you really care  
I don't believe in nothing no more  
  
Can't find the truth  
I just need to score  
Don't give me Hare Krishna  
Keep it to yourself man  
  
Stand back  
Get back  
Do you believe in Jesus  
Is he there  
  
Is there a God above  
And does he really care  
Oh yeah  
Jesus are you there  
  
And do you really care  
Take me on a cruise around the world  
Give me a break  
Bring me a girl  
  
Getting crazy about World War Three  
It's suicide of the sanctuary  
Should I believe in Jesus  
Is he there  
  
Is there a God above  
And does he really care  
Oh yeah  
Jesus are you there  
  
And do you really care  
Oh yeah  
No no no no  
Jesus are you there  
  
Oh yeah  
No no no no no no  
Do you really care  
Jesus are you there  
  
Anybody in  
Jesus Jesus Jesus are you there

Nobody feels any pain  
Tonight as I stand inside the rain  
Everybody knows  
That baby's got new clothes  
  
But lately I've seen her  
Ribbons and her bows  
Have fallen from her curls  
She takes just like a woman  
  
She makes love just like a woman  
And she aches just like a woman  
But she breaks just like a little girl  
Yes she does  
  
Yeah  
Queen Mary  
She's my friend  
Yes, I believe I'll go see her again  
  
Nobody has to guess  
That baby can't be blessed  
'Til she sees finally  
That she's like all the rest  
  
With her fog  
Her amphetamine  
And her pearls  
She takes just like a woman  
  
She makes love just like a woman  
And she aches just like a woman  
But she breaks just like a little girl  
It was raining from the first  
  
And I was dying of thirst  
So I came in here  
And your long time curse hurts  
But what's worse  
  
Is the pain in here  
I can't stay in here  
Ain't it clear  
That I just can't fit  
  
Yes, I believe that it's time for us to quit  
When we meet again  
Introduced as friends  
Please don't let on that you knew me when  
  
I was hungry  
And it was your world all the way  
Ah, you fake just like a woman  
You make love just like a woman  
  
Then you ache just like a woman  
But you break just like a little girl  
Let me see through you baby  
Come on now  
  
Baby, you can break down yeah  
Just like a woman  
Just like a woman  
Just like a woman  
Just like a woman  
  
Show me  
Show me baby  
Just like a woman  
Just like a woman  
  
Yeah  
Just like a woman  
Just like a woman

BOLLOCKS!  
It ain't the way that you look at me  
No nor the way you talk  
Could be a dark side coming out of me  
  
But I just like that way that you walk  
And I know what you've got is a thing for me  
And I want that thing awful bad  
Don't mess around  
  
This is too intense  
I'm getting hot on the spot  
Tell me just to laydown  
And stay down  
  
For my love  
Laydown  
And stay down  
For my love  
  
Yeah  
Laydown  
Could be the way that you're smiling  
But I don't think so  
  
Could be the jukebox  
But I don't think so  
Could be the way the stars are out tonight  
We're living in some afterglow  
  
Come on come on  
Come on alright  
What you've got is what I need tonight  
Feelin' good  
  
I feel alright  
Come on girl  
Don't take all night  
Gonna laydown  
  
And stay down  
For my love  
Laydown and stay down  
For my love  
  
This could be the rainbow bridge  
Crossing over to Shangri-La  
The midnight sky above our heads  
You can be who you are  
  
Tell me to laydown  
Stay down  
For my love  
Laydown  
  
And stay down  
For my love  
Laydown  
Come on why don't you  
  
Laydown  
Come on come on come on  
Laydown  
Come on why don't you just  
  
Laydown tonight  
Laydown  
Come on  
Laydown  
  
Yeah  
Laydown

I've been out here in this wasteland  
Throwing horseshoes at the stars  
Nickel, Silver, and pearl inlay  
On an old guitar for my new life  
For the playwright and the printer  
Theme cafes and tourist bars  
They're on a permanent vacation  
Like butterflies in killing jars  
How the hell did it get this far  
Let's go now  
Maybe we'll walk  
Maybe we'll fly  
See'mon now  
Let's get outta here  
While we're still young  
Take our dreams and run  
See'mon now  
Let's get outta here  
All the songs I sing were for you  
Though it's something I've denied  
Time is short so let's start running  
To hell with pride  
Cause time moves fast  
See'mon baby make it last  
Let's go now  
Maybe we'll walk  
Maybe we'll fly  
See'mon now  
Let's get outta here  
While we're still young  
Take out dreams and run  
See'mon now  
Let's get outta here  
There's a big sky  
There's a big sky there for you and me  
Got no horizon  
Who needs a compass  
I've got you and you got me  
See'mon baby  
It feels so good to be free  
Maybe we'll walk  
Maybe we'll fly  
See'mon now  
Let's get outta here  
You've got the keys  
Baby I can drive  
See'mon now let's get outta here  
Maybe we'll walk  
Maybe we'll fly  
See'mon now let's get outta here  
You've got that look  
You make it clear  
See'mon now let's get outta here  
Yeah yeah  
Get a piece of big sky  
It's yours and mine  
Yeah yeah  
Big sky  
Big sky

Ain't it beautiful  
Don't it make you feel complete  
It comes into your life  
Then sweeps you right off your feet  
  
Time stands still for two lovers  
And it's intangible  
But it hits like steel  
It stops me in my tracks  
  
Makes my private world unsealed  
A crashed car  
A communication failsafe  
We could share this vision  
  
In fact we've got no choice  
Into the arena of love  
Speaking with one voice  
Ain't it something else  
  
Like skydiving into Shangri-la  
And the clearest cool is the zeal-blue heaven  
And you can't quite put your finger on it  
And you could be anywhere  
  
Anytime anyplace in your lover's arms  
Could be paradise or walkin' on thin ice  
We can share this vision  
We're on some one-way street  
  
Exchanging cigarettes and glances  
We both feel the heat  
It's a love collision  
Love collision  
  
There's no decision  
It's a love collision  
If I close my eyes  
Visualizing you and I somewhere in this city  
  
And moments of desire  
The steady the silent gaze of lovers transfixed  
We could share this vision  
In fact we've got no choice  
  
Into the arena of love  
Speaking with one voice  
It's a love collision  
Love collision  
  
And there's no decision  
It's a love collision  
  
Love collision  
Love collision  
Love collision  
Love collision  
Love collision  
Love collision  
  
Oh no  
Love collision  
Love collision  
Love collision

I've been watching you now  
I've been caught in these hours  
Days are turning to nights  
Out of where there's no  
  
No rules for strangers  
When I see you again  
Will you still feel the same way  
Understand  
  
In your eyes  
I can't get nothing right  
All day  
All night  
  
Make it happen  
Make me feel alright  
All day  
All night  
  
Make it happen  
Make me feel alright  
Oh yeah  
When I see you walk by  
  
Turn my head want to break down  
I've been living alone  
I've been living a lie  
I get so scared of my fears  
  
There's a space in my life  
For just one time  
Or baby forever  
Understand  
  
It's in your eyes  
I can't get nothing right  
All day  
All night  
  
Make it happen  
Make me feel alright  
All day  
All night  
  
Make it happen  
Make me feel alright  
I've been watching you now  
And I've been living in a daydream  
  
It's that I miss you so  
Can't think of words  
I break down  
I've been lonely  
  
When I see you again  
Will you still feel the same way  
Understand  
In your eyes  
  
I can't do nothing right  
All day  
All night  
Make it happen  
  
Make me feel alright  
All day  
All night  
Make it happen  
  
Make me feel alright  
All day  
All night  
Make it happen  
  
Make me feel alright  
All day  
Make it happen  
Make me feel alright  
  
All day  
Make it happen  
Alright  
Make it happen  
  
Yeah  
Make it happen  
Yeah

Everytime I think of you, I always catch my breath  
And I'm still standing here, and you're miles away  
And I'm wonderin' why you left  
And there's a storm that's raging through my frozen heart tonight  
  
I hear your name in certain circles, and it always makes me smile  
I spend my time thinkin' about you, and it's almost driving me wild  
And there's a heart that's breaking down this long distance line tonight  
  
I ain't missing you at all since you've been gone away  
I ain't missing you, no matter what I might say  
  
There's a message in the wire, and I'm sending you this signal tonight  
You don't know how desperate I've become  
And it looks like I'm losing this fight  
In your world I have no meaning, though I'm trying hard to understand  
And it's my heart that's breaking down this long distance line tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
I ain't missing you at all since you've been gone away  
I ain't missing you, no matter what my friends say  
  
And there's a message that I'm sending out, like a telegraph to your soul  
And if I can't bridge this distance, stop this heartbreak overload  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I ain't missing you, I ain't missing you, I can lie to myself  
  
And there's a storm that's raging through my frozen heart tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ain't missing you, I ain't missing you  
I ain't missing you, I can lie to myself  
Ain't missing you, I ain't missing you  
I ain't missing you, I ain't missing you  
I ain't missing you, I ain't missing you, ain't missing you, oh no  
No matter what my friends might say, I ain't missing you...

Fell out of the sky sometime in 1952  
Through the radiance  
Looking for my shoes  
Daddy left and momma cried  
Had a passport for the blues  
I didn't share their hometown point of view  
Cause I need more  
I need more  
Just give me one good reason  
What I'm living for  
In this uncertain world of circumstance  
With one foot in the door  
At the house of truth  
That's burnt down to the floor  
I want more  
Yeah  
I need more  
In my days  
Tripping down the turnpike somewhere  
Out there near the shore  
Looking for some words to live by  
In the uncertain moments in the loam  
You can almost hear it shine  
Is that voice I'm hearing divine  
Cause I hear more  
I hear more  
Just give me one good reason  
What I'm living for  
In this concrete world of fairy tales  
Only innocence is pure  
But there must be an answer  
Yeah I'm sure  
So give me more  
Yeah  
Give me more in my day  
Am I dreaming  
Am I somewhere else  
When I'm lying in the darkness  
Am I really by myself  
There must be more  
Yeah  
More in my days  
Am I dreaming  
Am I someone else  
When I'm dancing in the darkness  
Am I dancing by myself  
There must be more  
Must be more to this  
Yeah  
Cause I want more  
Yeah  
And I need more  
And I hear more  
Yeah  
Give me more in my world everyday  
Give me more  
Yeah  
Give me more  
Give me more  
Of this life

There's something in you... child  
A mystery that I can't define  
But it blows my mind  
I'm walking on air... with you  
A kite in the sky  
Without a care  
It's something we share  
And all of these clues  
Lead me to you  
Hey!... I'm so surprised  
Everything that fills my eyes  
Is about you and this new thing  
Hey! Is it really true  
Everything I say and do  
Is about you and this new thing... lo'  
And if I feel blue... child  
I come to you so free and so wild  
And I feel fine  
The little things you do... I find  
Here in my eyes, my heart and my mind  
Your sexy smile  
Your sense of style  
Your kiss!  
Hey!... I'm so surprised  
Everything that fills my eyes  
Is about you and this new thing  
Hey! Is it really true  
Everything I say and do  
Is about you  
Hey!... It fells so good  
I never thought I ever would  
Find a new thing  
Such a new thing  
Hey!... One and one make two  
So everything I say and do is about you  
And this new thing... love  
And this new thing... Love  
  

I can't take you to the movies  
And I can't tell the real thing  
From a fake  
But I'm curled up tight  
In your Chevrolet  
And baby you got wow  
You've got what it takes  
You've got no brakes  
I can't take you anywhere these days  
Baby you're going wild  
Your lips and nylons  
Baby you've got what I think  
I think it takes  
You've got no taste  
You've got what it takes  
A gal with no brakes at all  
Whispering in my ear  
When you're breathing baby  
Hold me near  
Closer closer still  
Ah woo  
Yeah  
Baby you look so good tonight  
Take that dress right off  
Stand there right in front of me  
Baby you're going to make  
My poor rocking heart break  
Got no brakes  
You've got what it takes tonight  
For a gal with no brakes  
Going to make something straight tonight  
Gonna gonna make it all right  
The morning sun  
Coming up  
We ain't got no brakes  
We ain't got no brakes  
Ow ow  
We ain't got no brakes  
We ain't got none  
We ain't got no brakes  
Ow

There's diamonds in the avenue  
As the dayshift turns to night  
In the empire dinner dreaming  
Hard rain, fluorescent lights  
And the waitress fills my coffee cup  
As the working girls go by  
Drenched Irish cops are dreaming sex  
And peep show alibis  
Everything underneath the skyline  
From the east side to the west  
I see the miracles in real time  
And there's one I've loved the best  
I see there's an angel on the D train  
And she's flying to my world  
And I'm waiting for a, a New York City girl  
Times Square looks like Avalon  
In a Disney Morphine dream  
Dylan Thomas rides a white horse drunk  
At the counter next to me  
I wake up in her bed sometimes  
And watch her as she sleeps  
In the silence and the sirens  
I pray her soul to keep  
Everything underneath the skyline  
From the east side to the west  
I see the miracles in real time  
And there's one I've loved the best  
See there's an angel on the D train  
And she's flying to my world  
And I'm waiting for a New York City girl  
The Catherine wheel burns bright tonight  
Down on the avenue  
But nowhere near as bright, my love  
As the fire that burns for you  
Everything underneath the skyline  
From the east side to the west  
Of the lives I've lived and those I've known  
There is one I've loved the best  
See there's an angel on the D train  
And she's flying to my world  
And I'm waiting for a New York City girl  
Oh yeah, and I'm waiting for a New York City girl  
I'm waiting now  
New York City girl  
Oh yeah, I'm waiting for  
New York City girl  
Oh, yeah, yeah  
New York City girl  

Girl sometimes it seems to me  
That I don't say the things I should  
To you I act like I'm no good  
And you wait for me patiently  
This house  
Is not a home without you  
It takes two hearts to share  
Your eyes will always see through me  
And bring me to my knees  
And I will always turn to you  
You're everything I need  
And through the good and bad times  
You have always been there  
We hold each other close  
You tell me its alright  
The nights we fight about it  
Never dream of giving up  
That's the price of love  
Love sometimes it makes us cry  
Forgive me when I get it wrong  
Sometimes it's hard  
To be that strong  
And oh I would do anything  
For you I'd turn the stars around  
I'd find the way somehow  
This time you'll see I'll build  
A bridge to you again  
Love shines to sweep away the past  
We're more than lovers more than friends  
And through the good and bad times  
You have always been there  
We hold each other tight you tell me it's alright  
The nights we fight about it  
Never think of giving up  
That's the price of love  
Your eyes will always see through me  
And bring me to my knees  
And I will always turn to you  
You're everything I need  
And through the good and bad times  
You have always been there  
We hold each other close you tell me its alright  
And sometimes I can't give enough  
That's the price of love  
That's the price of love  
That's the price of love

Three years come  
I'm still alone and you're so lonely  
I look in the mirror  
I see those lines on my face  
All of my dreams are gone  
Flyin' with the starlings  
But they were not stolen gems  
Colored glass I can replace  
You've got a restless heart  
Restless change is blowing  
Through your life  
Tears in your eyes  
Tears in the books that I've been reading  
I don't understand you now  
And I never did  
But I still love your restless heart  
Days into nights  
Nights into days  
Lights flicker 'round me  
And down to the shore I walk  
I'm haunted by your face  
Ungracious moves I've made  
Just like a broken dancer  
If I could get you back  
They are steps I would retrace  
You've got a restless heart  
Restless change is blowing through your life  
Tears in your eyes  
Tears in the books that I've been reading  
I don't understand you now  
And I never will  
But I still love your restless heart  
Three years come  
You're still alone and I'm so alone  
And I would give anything  
To feel my heart beat again  
I wouldn't say that I've been losin' time  
I've been dreaming  
And I'd give up anything to keep you as my friend  
You've got a restless heart  
Restless change is blowing through your life  
Tears in your eyes  
Tears in the books I've been reading  
I don't understand you now  
And I never did  
But I love you  
And I know you've got a restless heart  
(Restless heart)  
I know you've got a restless heart (in you)  
(Restless heart)  
I know (in you)  
You got a restless heart (heart)  
And I know it (in you)  
You got a restless heart (heart)  
You got a restless heart (in you)  
I know it (heart)  
But I'm just like you (in you)  
Just like you

Come on baby don't you want to go  
I could take you there  
You could get what you want in the south  
You could let down your hair  
  
I said do you don't you will you won't you  
Baby won't you please let me know  
I ain't talkin' 'bout Chicago

Makin' a run for Mexico  
Makin' a run for Mexico  
  
Could you  
Come on baby cause I got to know  
The law is after me  
I killed a man in a bar last night  
  
There was no other way it could be  
While the air in this joint could be cut with a knife  
As the jukebox got rotten selections  
Bring a compass and some money for gas  
  
'Cause I ain't gonna stop for directions  
Not to Mexico  
Na na na na na  
Makin' a run to Mexico  
  
Na na na na na  
Makin' a run to Mexico  
Could you  
Oh oh  
  
Come on baby don't you want to go  
I gotta get away  
And everytime the phone rings  
It scares me to death  
  
Saw my face in the paper today  
I don't want to hear the stories  
About your mama and papa  
No I don't want to hear you cry  
  
For me there's no second chance right now  
It's the F. B. fucking I!  
Na na na na na  
Na na na na na  
  
Makin' a run to Mexico

In Mexico

Workin' overtime  
Just to keep myself from getting sacked  
Well I don't like my job  
Tell the boss to shove it  
  
I ain't goin' back  
Just like Gene Vincent  
I'm longing to prove  
I know what I need this time  
  
Me and my girl together  
Yeah  
Saturday night  
Oh yeah  
  
Saturday night  
Lookin' at my watch  
Tappin' my fingers  
Wishin' time would fly  
  
Gonna look so sharp  
She and I will turn some heads as we walk by  
And just like Vermeer  
I wait for still life to move out of my mind  
  
Tonight  
I might suddenly all feel better  
Saturday night  
Oh yeah  
  
Saturday night  
Ow  
And I feel like the rain on the edge of a rhyme  
On the streets I'll shine  
  
Forever in an instant  
Saturday night  
Oh yeah  
Saturday night  
  
Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday night  
Crossin' off the days in my brain  
Gonna get it good  
Gonna get it right  
  
Ain't it just like Verlaine  
To be dancin' in the streets  
I know what I need this time  
Me and my girl together  
  
Oh yeah Saturday night  
Oh yeah Saturday night

I've been searchin' for a long time  
For someone exactly like you  
I've been travelin' all around the world  
Waitin' for you to come through  
Someone like you  
To make it all worthwhile  
Someone like you  
To keep me satisfied  
Someone exactly like you  
Just like you  
I've been traveling a hard road  
Baby looking for someone exactly like you  
I've been carrying this heavy load  
Waiting for your light to some shining through  
Someone like you  
Could make it all worthwhile  
Someone like you baby  
To keep me satisfied  
Someone exactly like you  
Just like you  
Yeah baby  
Just like you  
And I've been doing some real soul-searching  
Tryin' to find out where you're at  
And I've been up and down this highway  
To all kinds of foreign lands  
Someone like you  
To make it all worthwhile  
And someone like you  
To keep me so satisfied  
Someone exactly like you  
Just like you  
Someone like you  
Could make it all worthwhile  
Someone like you  
Could keep me so satisfied  
Someone exactly like you  
Yes someone exactly like you  
Just like you  
I've been searching  
For such a long time  
Marching to the beat  
Of a different drum  
And now I realize  
The best is yet to come  
Someone just like you  
Someone just like you

I know you're someone's daughter  
You know I'm somebody's son  
We spent our lives until this moment  
Looking for the special one  
  
Nobody gave us the directions  
To this life we have to live  
Although we've both been taken  
We've got so much left to give  
  
So much left to give  
I know it's right behind me  
The blue highway that I've run  
It led me here to find you  
  
It's worth everything I've done  
To find my special one  
Now I've found my special one  
Now I've found my special one  
  
Maybe we won't find the answers  
Maybe life is just a song  
It may be imagination  
But the vision seems so strong  
  
From the first time that I saw you  
I knew how it would be  
The world is full of wonder  
It takes both of us to see  
  
It takes both of us to see  
I know it's right behind me  
The blue highway that I've run  
It led me here to find you  
  
It's worth everything I've done  
To find my special one  
Now I've found my special one

I can't reach behind your eyes  
You always look away  
You hide behind your alibis  
And change your mind  
from day to day  
If there's something I can do  
Then I'll be there  
Outside your broken world  
You'll see it's me who cares  
Take me straight to your heart  
Cause this time's real  
and real lasts forever  
I know where you are  
Cause you know  
I've been there before  
Straight to your heart  
I watch you move  
and I watch you dance  
I watch you drift away  
And I'd give anything for you  
And you know that's bad  
When it gets that way  
You can't go on like this  
And I don't want to fight again  
I don't give a damn anymore  
Right or wrong you're gonna let me in  
Straight to your heart  
Cause this time's real and real lasts forever  
I know where you are  
Cause you know I've been there before  
Straight to your heart this time this time  
Baby I know where you are  
Cause you know I've been there before  
Then maybe I'll break down the walls  
And my love will go  
Straight to your heart  
Inside  
Take me inside yeah  
Straight to your heart  
Cause this time's real and real lasts forever  
I know where you are  
Cause this time we're goin' all the way  
Straight to your heart  
This time  
This time  
Baby it's straight  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
This time it's straight to your heart  
Oh yeah  
Cause this time it's real

You say there's nothing wrong  
With the lessons that your learning  
The school of the streets  
You'll kick next year  
Skateboarding hollywood and vine  
Yeah  
You're a spaced out face in a crowd  
You're 17 and shooting  
The cars slow down to check you out  
And your tattered freak flag flies  
For sale, your habit  
Where to? let's go!  
I know  
Out on the internet tonight  
Deals made  
Between the strangers  
In green lights  
No names  
No touch no feel humanity  
You and your suicide life  
In a cardboard mansion sleeping  
Out there just beneath the freeway  
On a broken bottle carpet  
Snoring now  
The lord of the universe  
Yeah  
A hippie called john henry  
A burnt out acid tripper  
Yeah yeah yeah  
A symbol and a brush stroke  
And a barstool for a throne  
Encino, jerusalem  
Angel, dust and blow  
I know  
Out on the interstate tonight  
Hell's angels  
And poet cops alright alright  
New names  
And tie dyed blissed out humanity  
You and your suicide life  
Suicide life  
Yeah baby  
Have a nice day  
At the heart of all this darkness  
You got a crush on venus big time  
Nodding out into a wet dream  
The strangers take you  
They take you  
The slave trade sister rapes you  
I know  
Out on the interstate tonight  
Hell's angels  
And poet cops alright alright  
New names  
And tie dyed blissed out humanity  
Oh no  
You live in real time  
Kings the knife  
You and your suicide life  
Suicide life  
Hell's angels  
And poet cops alright  
Spare change and have a nice day  
I believe you're here to stay  
Yeah  
Have a nice day  
I believe your here to stay  
Come home  
Come home baby  
I think you're here to stay  
Time to come home  
Hippie called john henry

Born in Louisiana in a town called Franklin  
I was fully matured by the time I reached the age of ten  
A mulatto girl is what they called me  
And us mulattos had no trouble at all with men  
All men say that I'm as sweet as honey  
Cause on 34 38 and 22 at the tonky  
  
They called me Sweet Rhode Island Red, Sweet Rhode Island Red  
Sweet Rhode Island Red, Sweet Rhode Island Red  
Sweety is what they said about Sweet Rhode Island Red  
  
Tried to live a life I thought I wanted me to  
I went to church, been to school  
But there never had to be a White near you  
? But on fast uptown I'd need the jobs?  
They were just too hard headed to leave me alone  
They said that I was sweet as honey  
Cause on 34 38 and 22 at the tonky  
  
They called me Sweet Rhode Island Red, Sweet Rhode Island Red  
Sweet Rhode Island Red, Sweet Rhode Island Red  
Sweety is what they said about Sweet Rhode Island Red  
  
I was 17 when I moved to New Orleans  
Cause living in the city has always been my dream  
People laughed, said it was a shame and a pity  
When old mayor Daley gave me the key to the city  
He too said that I was as sweet as honey  
Cause on 34 38 and 22 at the tonky  
  
They called me Sweet Rhode Island Red, Sweet Rhode Island Red  
Sweet Rhode Island Red, Sweet Rhode Island Red  
Sweety is what they said about Sweet Rhode Island Red

You left me here alone  
I guess I'll never see the light  
You turned another's thumb  
And he makes your wrongs  
Seem right  
Out on some different wavelength  
Somehow he brings you more  
But sweetheart tonight  
I know for sure  
I'll see those tears  
The damage they do  
You're breaking my heart with those tears  
I'll cry over you  
Can we make a new start  
Of all the girls I've had at my knees  
You're the only one  
That could bring me to these tears  
A master of the beat  
You've got my number in your hands  
A killer on the streets  
You've got your actions planned  
But somewhere in your heart  
There must be a place for me  
Cause sweetheart tonight  
I know for sure  
I'll see those tears  
The damage they do  
You're breaking my heart with those tears  
I'll cry over you  
Can we make a new start  
Of all the girls I've had at my knees  
You're the only one  
That could bring me to these tears  
Oh yeah  
Oh yeah  
I'm looking at you  
You're looking at me  
You won't let me go  
But you won't set me free  
Of those tears  
The damage they do  
You're breaking my heart with those tears  
Cry over you  
Cry for you tonight  
Cry you a river  
I'm gonna cry for you tonight  
I'm gonna cry you a river  
Cry you a river tonight  
(Cry for you)  
I'm gonna cry for you tonight  
(Cry for you)  
I'm gonna cry you a river  
(Cry for you)  
I'll cry for you tonight

I will be there for you  
For you are mine  
And I'll take care of you  
Every single time  
I'll be watching over you  
When the world seems bitter cold  
When you're closer to the edge  
And you're feeling so alone  
But do you still recognize  
When you hear love's voice  
I will come through for you  
Every single time  
And I will be there in your winter  
To turn your water into wine  
And I'll be there in your darkness  
In the daylight like your sun  
You see you make my heart beat fast  
My love  
You are my special one  
But do you still recognize  
When you hear love's voice  
But are you so surprised  
That you and I  
We've both got a choice  
Do you hear my name  
On a crowded street  
Ain't it such a shame  
All our hearts are incomplete  
Oh oh oh  
Together together  
Ah ah ah  
I'll be there in your darkness  
In the daylight like your sun  
See you make my heart beat fast my love  
You are my special one  
Do you still recognize  
When you hear love's voice  
Are you surprised  
You and I we've both got a choice  
Can you feel my heart beat  
Like I feel your heart beat  
Lovers of the world  
Never complete  
Can you hear  
Can you hear my voice  
In this dark and lonely place  
You and I will always have a choice  
Can't you hear my voice  
Can't you see this look on my face  
You and I we've still got a choice  
Can't you hear my voice  
Can't you see this look in my eyes  
We've both got a choice  
Can you hear my voice  
Don't you see if you believe in me  
We've both got a choice

There's a silent movie  
Running off its reel inside my mind  
As I try to fall asleep tonight  
On prescription lullabies  
In the darkness there's a doorway  
That leads me back to you forever  
But these days there's only  
You and I in photographs  
Ambitions and dreams we've shared  
Now I wonder who has got the last laugh  
Cause I know you're crying  
And you know I'm cold inside  
Got no expectations for my pride  
And I reach for that glittering prize  
I remember on our wedding day  
Looking back at you  
Our eyes met and we said goodbye  
As we both said "I do"  
Didn't I make a promise baby  
I would stand by you forever  
But sometimes the best-laid plans  
Flare up and blow away  
And fairytale logic comes  
Sweeps you heart  
Your soul' your world away  
Cause I know you're crying  
And you know I'm cold inside  
And I'm tired of living with that lie  
And now time is flying  
And you know I miss that fire  
But I feel for you  
I've got desire  
So I reach for that glittering prize  
No doll's house dreams  
Or valentines  
Just the future at the door  
Just leaving trains and empty rooms  
A broken band of gold  
Cause love don't live here anymore  
And some nights I'll come and see you  
And I know you'll let me in  
Two strangers in silence now  
Cause you know in love  
We could never win  
I know you're crying  
And you know I'm cold inside  
And I'm tired of living with this lie  
These days  
Cause now time is flying  
And you know I miss that fire  
Cause I feel for you  
I've got desire  
Baby baby  
In my world (in your world tonight)  
Reach for that glittering prize (in my world)  
That's all I ever seemed to do (in your world tonight)  
Was reach for the glittering prize (in my world)  
I lost myself when I lost you (in your world tonight)  
As I reached for that glittering prize (in my world)  
And I hope that all your dreams come true (in your world tonight)  
When you reach for that glittering prize (in my world)  
In your world  
In my world tonight

Babe I had a dream  
Woke up in a sweat  
Darkness all around me  
I was caught in its net  
Tried to reach for you  
But you weren't there  
It only was a dream  
But it put danger in the air  
I can feel the nervous rhythm  
Of your heart with mine  
Could we ever stay together  
Stand the test of time  
Baby make me a believer  
Cause this world will lie  
(Oh these times are hard for lovers)  
It's getting harder for you and me  
(Oh)  
It's hard on me and you  
Baby we can make it  
Cause our love will pull us through  
These times are hard for lovers  
It's down to me in you  
Nothing's gonna break us  
If we hang on to what's true  
These times are hard for lovers  
I believe in you  
These times are hard for lovers  
I believe in you  
Everywhere you turn  
Trouble going on  
Living under pressure  
Loving under the gun  
It's hard enough to live  
Draw another breath  
Hang on to me baby  
Like it's life or death  
I can feel the nervous rhythm of your heart with mine  
Could we ever stay together  
Stand the test of time  
Baby make me a believer  
Cause this world will lie  
(Oh these times are hard for lovers)  
It's getting harder for you and me  
(Oh)  
It's hard on me and you  
Baby we can make it  
Cause our love will pull us through  
These times are hard for lovers  
It's down to me in you  
Nothing's gonna break us  
If we hang on to what's true  
These times are hard for lovers  
I believe in you  
These times are hard for lovers  
I believe in you  
Can you feel the nervous rhythm of your heart with mine  
Could we ever stay together  
Stand the test of time  
Baby make me a believer  
Cause this world will lie  
We've got to go the distance  
Touch the sky  
Baby we can make it  
Cause our love will pull us through  
These times are hard for lovers  
It's down to me in you  
Nothing's gonna break us  
If we hang on to what's true  
These times are hard for lovers  
I believe in you  
(These times are hard for lovers whoa)  
Whoa  
(These times are hard for lovers oh yeah)  
(These times are hard for lovers whoa)  
Whoa  
(These times are hard for lovers oh yeah)  
I believe in you  
(These times are hard for lovers whoa)  
When I turn to you  
(These times are hard for lovers oh yeah)  
Yeah  
But I don't believe it  
(These times are hard for lovers whoa)  
Yeah  
(These times are hard for lovers oh yeah)  
Whoa  
(These times are hard for lovers whoa)  
Baby I believe in you  
(These times are hard for lovers oh yeah)  
Baby I believe in you  
(These times are hard for lovers whoa)  
Baby I believe in you  
(These times are hard for lovers oh yeah)

Thinking about old times  
Thinking about the things we said  
All the worthless games and lies  
I'm looking at myself  
And the mirror's unkind  
You're inside my mind  
And you're outside my eyes  
And I'm looking for something  
That's real in my life, something true, yeah!  
And I'm looking for something to hold on to  
But I guess it won't be you  
Thinking about  
Thinking about  
Thinking about you all the time  
You're on my mind  
But this song is not for you  
Of all the things I could've done  
I walked right out the door  
Left like a loaded gun  
Into the street  
And these new days drag on  
Through the long afternoon  
I'm smashed and Flintstones are on TV  
Repeat  
Yeah well sometimes I wake up round midnight  
With you wreathed around my skull  
Like a halo of lies most of the time  
And I'm in denial coming down from the ceiling  
I was just your stepping stone  
You burned out all my feelings  
Chorus out  
  

We've seen a lifetime since we met  
Through good and bad  
And things we won't forget  
Forgotten promises and broken vows  
But we always made it through somehow  
But the key to you is broken in the lock  
And a simple band of gold is all we've got  
It's in the things that I can't say  
That tear us both apart  
But if you keep listening  
You'll hear inside my heart of hearts  
Darling, the simple things are hard to say  
And darling the words get in the way  
The poet sees the world through rhymes  
But only says so much  
See darling, the words are in my touch  
The meaning's in my touch  
And maybe there's something I should say  
To make everything that's wrong Ok  
A simple phrase, a sonnet from a play  
But a man can only say so much these days  
And we're drifting to the deep end of the lake  
Trying to make good on our past mistakes  
And I know you're tired  
But heaven's here and now  
I've got no explanation  
Words are worthless to me now  
Darling... etc  
  

Missin' at school  
Bustin' the rules  
Hates everything in sight  
Needs some new shoes  
  
Dad's on the booze  
She's never there  
Far away kid  
All on his own  
  
Can't tell the wrong from right  
Thin as a rake  
Tough as a nail tonight  
Tonight  
  
Here are your hopes for the future you'll see  
If you hang 'round the neck of a loser like me  
There's no one else in your life  
You don't need anyone  
  
Come with me in the night  
I will give you the matches  
I will make you complete  
Won't you please come with me  
  
I won't ask you again  
I can give you the hopes of a younger man  
In the night we can hear  
I'm your friend and what's more  
  
I will give you what you've been looking for  
Yes I can give you what you've been looking for  
Should I run  
Should I take it  
  
Should I go or should I stay?  
Who side am I on in this game that we play  
I want to be somebody someday  
Living my life away  
  
And I can't find a job  
I can't pay the rent  
Police are always breathing down my neck  
And there's no way out  
  
There's no way out no more  
Under this flag  
We're all Union Jacks  
And there's no home for the brave  
  
And there's no way back  
We are the obeyer  
We are the law  
In stained boots  
  
And navy blue  
Hello hello hello  
With fire in my heart and you along beside me  
We'll burn down all the schools  
  
That taught us there's nothing better than  
To live by all the rules  
Made by the ruling classes  
So the scales of justice tip  
  
In the favor of the government  
Under this flag  
We're all Union Jacks  
And there's no home for the brave  
  
And there's no way back  
We are the obeyer  
We are the law  
In stained boots  
  
And navy blue  
Hello hello hello  
With fire in my heart and you along beside me  
We'll burn down all the schools  
  
That taught us there's nothing better than  
To live by all the rules  
Made by the ruling classes  
So the scales of justice tip  
  
In the favor of the government  
Under this flag  
We're all Union Jacks  
And there's no home for the brave  
  
And there's no way back  
Under this flag  
We're all Union Jacks  
And there's no home for the brave  
  
And there's no way back  
Tonight  
Here are your hopes for a future you'll see  
You're like me  
  
We're all Union Jacks

Inside these moments waiting  
Beneath the windows of  
The house of love  
Like Romeo to Juliet above  
The lights out on the freeway  
They lead me back to you  
For always and forever now  
I'll be with you  
Cause you know that I've come here for a reason  
Tell me that there's something to this rhyme  
Listen to your heart  
Tell me what you want now  
But don't let me be denied  
And be my valentine  
Be mine  
The dragonfly at midnight  
The jasmine of your room  
The candle light inside our eyes  
The dawn will come too soon  
I come to you as nothing now  
But everything I am  
I'm burning for you constantly  
Just let me be your man  
Cause you know that I've come here for a reason  
Tell me that there's something to this rhyme  
Listen to your heart  
Tell me what you want now  
But don't let me be denied  
And be my valentine  
Be mine  
Valentine  
Cause you know that I've come here for a reason  
Tell me that there's something to this rhyme  
Listen to your heart  
And tell me what you want now  
But don't let me be denied  
And be my valentine  
Be mine  
Be my valentine  
Be mine

Sour milk in the saucer  
And the cat won't come home  
And sometimes New York City  
Feels like burnin' Rome  
I'm lost and I'm crazy  
Too much time on my own  
I'd give anything to find a heart  
That can't be sold  
Welcome to paradise  
Here is my brave new world  
And in my paradise  
I'm waiting for a certain girl  
Dead flowers in the darkness  
Red rose wrapped in lace  
Ice-cold vodka tears  
Stainin' my face  
My heart's growin' colder  
And the things I have seen  
Won't someone come and get me  
Wake me from this dream  
Welcome to paradise  
Here is my brave new world  
And in my paradise  
I'm waiting for a special girl  
Here in my paradise  
I'm waitin' for something new  
And here in my brave new world  
I'm waitin' for something new  
I can hear church bells ringing  
White rice hits blue skies  
And the blind still lead the blind  
As they look for paradise  
Oh yeah  
Paradise  
Welcome to paradise  
Here is my brave new world  
And here in my paradise  
I'm waiting for a special girl  
I'm still looking for paradise  
In your eyes you seem so far away  
And to find paradise  
There's no price that I won't pay  
(We all find paradise)  
I'm still looking for paradise tonight  
(We all find paradise)  
And I won't find paradise  
I'll make it all right  
(We all find paradise)  
With you and I  
Comes into sight  
(We all find paradise)  
For you and I  
For you and I  
Paradise could be right  
(We all find paradise)  
I'm still looking for paradise tonight  
(We all find paradise)  
And I won't find paradise  
I'll make it all right  
(We all find paradise)

Sweet 17 in summertime  
Drunk on elderberry wine  
Laughing in the cornfields  
And taking our sweet time  
  
The world was ours together  
And all the things we had  
Were cast up in the future baby  
How could things turn out bad?  
  
Now I ain't waiting for  
Those days to return  
You showed me what love was  
I had such a lot to learn  
  
Hey baby  
I never knew a love so fine (When you were mine)  
Sweet darling  
When you were mine (When you were mine)  
  
7 Days a week  
365 a year  
We tripped the wild fantastic edge  
The truth was always clear  
  
They could never tame our wild hearts  
Or stop us making love  
We were so inseparable  
We could never get enough  
  
And it seems like only yesterday  
You made my world turn  
And these days I think about ya  
The fire still burns  
  
Hey baby  
I never knew a better time (When you were mine)  
Sweet darling  
When you were mine (When you were mine)  
  
Alright  
Everything we had was so complete  
And all our young hearts wanted was to be swept off our feet  
Yeah  
  
When you were mine  
In summertime  
I know there's no sense in looking back  
But everytime I think of it baby  
  
I just have to laugh  
Yeah well maybe just sometimes  
On my own  
Looking at my watch and thinking how time's flown  
  
Come back baby  
Like summer time  
And we can break a bottle of that elderberry wine  
Hey baby  
  
I never knew a better time (When you were mine)  
Sweet darling yeah  
When you were mine (When you were mine)  
Hey darling  
  
Come back to me one more time (When you were mine)  
Sweet darling  
When you were mine (When you were mine)  
Everything was good  
  
Everything was fine  
When you were mine (When you were mine)  
When you were mine baby (When you were mine)  
Come back just like summertime  
  
In the summertime

See you moving through the square  
In your motorcycle leather  
Diamonds cascade at your feet  
In an instant we are forever  
  
See you're a rebel with a cause  
No one ever gets close to you  
Oh whoa whoa whoa  
You're my wild one  
  
Oh whoa whoa whoa  
Come on stay my little wild one  
Wild one  
Yeah  
  
And you've got a crooked smile  
That takes that chip right off my shoulder  
And though your heart is out of reach  
I know that this world will make you colder  
  
So you're escaping down the road  
Into an outlaw world that only you know  
Oh whoa whoa whoa  
You're my wild one  
  
Oh whoa whoa whoa  
Come on stay my little wild one  
Oh whoa whoa whoa  
You can't stay free  
  
You can't stay mine  
Oh whoa whoa whoa  
Come on stay my little black swan  
This town seems small and lonely  
  
And you're the property of no one  
Turn again turn around  
All roads lead to London town  
Wild one  
  
Yeah  
Oh whoa whoa whoa  
You're my wild one  
Oh whoa whoa whoa  
  
Come on stay my little wild one  
Oh whoa whoa whoa  
You can't stay free  
You can't stay mine  
  
Oh whoa whoa whoa  
Oh whoa whoa whoa  
Yeah  
Oh whoa whoa whoa  
  
Yeah  
Oh whoa whoa whoa  
Yeah  
Oh whoa whoa whoa

Wild one  
Wild one

Oh whoa whoa whoa

Oh whoa whoa whoa  
Yeah  
  
Wild one  
Oh whoa whoa whoa

Give me one thing I can believe  
Give me one thing I can touch  
Taste  
Want  
  
Take again  
And again  
And again  
Give me something I can't remember  
  
Forget me not  
Give me something over and over  
Don't forget  
Keep me loved  
  
Give me something I can't ignore  
No  
Keep me preoccupied  
Keep me satisfied  
  
With a woman's touch  
Yeah  
Hold on baby  
Hold on tell you when  
  
Dream baby  
Dream again  
And again  
And again  
  
I want you tonight  
Hold on  
Hold on  
Make this thing right  
  
You know you want it  
You know I want it too  
Give it all  
Come on come through  
  
Give me something to believe in  
Give me  
Give me a woman's touch  
Yeah  
  
Yeah  
Oh  
It's all I want  
I want you  
  
And nobody else will do  
I need you  
Now  
Feels like a honeymoon  
  
Want you so  
Take my hand  
Don't let go  
You know you want it  
  
Yeah  
Nothing could ever mean as much  
No  
Keep me preoccupied  
  
Keep me satisfied  
With a woman's touch  
Yeah  
Keep me happy tonight  
  
Keep me wide awake  
Give me a woman's touch  
Yeah  
Yeah  
  
Make me feel alright  
Don't forget

Give your love away  
It's not the way you seem  
'Cause someone's just come in your life  
And broken up your dreams  
  
Look into my eyes and tell me what you see  
And if my eyes are empty  
Well that's the way I'm meant to be  
What I got  
  
Who am I  
I got the world in a bottle  
Oh oh  
Whatever I once was  
  
Is fading fast away  
My soul is like a shadow  
Growing fainter in the day  
I've never loved you more  
  
But you feel so out of reach  
My life is like a sun  
Sinking slowly in the beach  
What I got  
  
Who am I  
I got the world in a bottle  
Oh oh  
Come here  
  
I want you  
What I got  
Who am I  
I got the world in a bottle  
  
What I got  
Who am I  
I got the world in a bottle  
So give your love away  
  
It's not the way you seem  
Cause someone's just come in your life  
And broken up your dreams  
Look into my eyes and tell me what you see  
  
And if my eyes are empty  
Well that's the way I'm meant to be  
What I got  
Who am I  
  
I got the world in a bottle  
What I got  
Somebody  
Who am I  
  
I got the world in a bottle
