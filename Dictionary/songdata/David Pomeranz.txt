Too many billion people running around the planet  
What is the chance in heaven that you'd find your way to me  
Tell me what is this sweet sensation  
It's a miracle that happened  
Though I search for an explanation  
Only one thing it could be  
  
That I was born for you  
It was written in the stars  
Yes, I was born for you  
And the choice was never ours  
It's as if the powers of the universe  
Conspired to make you mine until the day I die  
I bless the day that I was born for you  
  
Too many foolish people try to come between us  
None of them seem to matter when I look into your eyes  
Now I know why I belong here  
In your arms I found the answer  
Somehow nothing would seem so wrong here  
If they'd only realize that  
I was born for you and that you were born for me  
And in this random world, this was clearly meant to be  
What we have the world could never understand  
Or ever take away until the day I die  
  
I bless the day that I was born for you  
What we have the world could never understand or ever take away  
And as the years go by until the day I die  
I bless the day that I was born for you

I was a man of convinction  
Itchin' in pure over-drive  
Burning both ends of the candle  
Searching for meaning in life  
Until that one night when it happened  
You took my soul by surprise  
And suddenly I knew the answer  
There in the blue of your eyes  
I learned it  
  
I learned it all from you  
I learned it all from you  
I heard it all ring true  
Everything I ever knew  
I learned it all from you  
  
My body flew back through the ages  
Where sages all wrote in stone  
You showed me what I was missing  
You helped me to find my way home  
I learned it  
  
I learned it all from you  
I learned it all from you  
I heard it all ring true  
Everything I ever knew  
I learned it all from you  
  
I learned it all from you  
I learned it all from you  
I heard it all ring true  
Everything I ever knew  
I learned it all from  
I learned it  
  
I learned it all from you  
I learned it all from you  
I heard it all ring true  
Everything I ever knew  
I learned it all from you

I believed in fairy tales  
In magic spells and wishing wells  
And pirate sails  
And once I thought I'd never fall in love  
That shows how much I knew  
I believed in Superman  
In Santa Claus, the world of Oz  
And wonderland  
But one by one those fantasies have failed  
While you keep shining through  
I still believe in you  
  
I could never doubt your kiss  
No other love  
Fills me like this  
If you take a chance, you'll see  
I believe in you  
Believe in me  
  
Other dreams may turn to dust  
But I don't care  
If you'll be there  
I'll always trust  
'Cause I believe with all my heart and soul  
This dream we share is true  
I still believe in you

We're the king and queen of hearts  
Hold me when the music starts  
All my dreams come true  
When I dance with you  
  
Promise me you're mine tonight  
I've been waitin' lyin' tonight  
While the lights are low  
I'll never let you go  
  
(Hoh) Did I dream that we danced forever  
In a wish that we made together  
On a night that I prayed would never end? (end)  
  
You know it's not my imagination  
Or a part of the orchestration  
Love was here at the culmination  
I'm the king and you're the queen of hearts  
  
Time will pass and tears will fall  
But someday we'll both recall  
Moments made of this  
Golden memories  
  
(Hoh) Did I dream that we danced forever  
In a wish that we made together  
On a night that I prayed would never end? (end)  
  
In a once and future dream  
Where the dances never seem to start  
  
(Hoh) Did I dream that we danced forever  
In a wish that we made together  
On a night that I prayed would never end? (end)

Here we stand today  
Like we always dreamed  
Starting out our life together  
The light is in your eyes  
Love is in our hearts  
I can't believe you're really mine forever  
  
Been rehearsing for this moment all my life  
So don't act surprised  
If the feeling starts to carry me away  
  
On this day  
I promise forever  
On this day  
I surrender my heart  
Here I stand take my hand  
And I will honor every word that I say  
On this day  
  
Not so long ago  
This earth was just a field of cold and lonely space  
Without you  
Now everything's alive  
Now everything's revealed  
And the story of my life  
Is all about you  
  
So if you feel the cool winds blowing  
Through your nights  
I will shelter you  
I'm forever here to chase  
Your fears away  
  
On this day  
I promise forever  
On this day  
I surrender my heart  
Here we stand like our plan  
Please say you'll always look at me this way  
On this day

Just an ordinary song  
To a special girl like you  
From a simple guy  
Who's so in love with you  
  
I may not have much to show  
No diamonds a glow  
No limousines  
To take you where you go  
  
But if you ever find yourself  
Tired of all the games you play  
When the world seems so unfair  
You can count on me to stay  
Just take sometime to lend an ear  
To this ordinary song  
  
Just an ordinary song  
To a special girl like you  
From a simple guy  
Who's so in love with you  
  
I don't even have the looks  
To make you glance my way  
The clothes I wear  
May just seem so absurd  
  
But deep inside of me is you  
You give life to what I do  
All those years may see you thru  
Still I'll be waiting here for you  
If you have time  
Pls lend an ear to this ordinary song  
  
Just an ordinary song  
To a special girl like you  
From a simple guy  
Who's so in love with you...

Every night, and I can't help but cry  
And I wonder why you have to leave me  
Why did it have to end so soon  
When you said that you would never leave me  
Ohhh tell me  
Where did I go wrong  
What did I do to make you change your mind completely  
When I thought this love would never end  
If this love was not ours to have  
I'll let it go with your good bye  
Ohhh why did it have to end so soon  
When you said that you would never leave me  
Ohhh tell me  
Where did I go wrong  
What did I do to make you change your mind completely  
When I thought this love would never end  
If this love was not ours to have  
I'll let it go with your good bye

Though it appears we're through  
Don't let that illusion make you sad  
We could no more say goodbye  
And if we would have say we never met  
So though we are parting tonight  
Don't be afraid we'll be alright  
  
The truth of us  
Is simply living a lie  
In a little while  
In a little while  
We will find  
The truth of us  
  
After finding other loves  
Tryin' to prove we're so aware and free  
But no matter how we run  
They're always gonna look like you and me  
So with time out to play out this hand  
We will discover us again  
  
The truth of us  
Is simply living a lie  
In a little while  
In a little while  
We will find  
We will find  
All that was strong  
We will right  
All that is wrong  
The truth of us  
Is simply living a lie  
  
We will find all was strong  
We will right  
All that is wrong  
The truth of us  
Is simply living a lie  
Don't cry.... Don't cry

In the cool of the evening  
When I was a boy  
I would gaze at the wide open skies  
And I'd dream of a someday  
When I'd be a man  
And live with a lady with lights in her eyes  
Well, I searched for that dream  
Till my heart nearly broke  
Till my hopes turned to hopeless and died  
Until just this morning when I suddenly woke  
Looked at you sleeping there and cried  
  
This is what I dreamed  
This is what I wished for  
Now all at once I see  
Everything I've ever wanted  
Is here with me  
  
Yes, this is what I dreamed  
Like a miracle unfolding  
Holding you near me  
Just like this  
  
Every moment, every kiss  
Is exactly how I pictured it would be  
I swear I must be dreamin'  
For this is what I dreamed, ooh  
  
And it's everywhere around us  
Every cloud in the sky  
Every breeze that blows by  
Can't believe I've been so blind  
To this sweet bliss  
  
Yes this is what I dreamed  
And I just can't help but wonder  
If under those same magic skies  
You were closing your eyes  
And dreaming of this moment with me  
My life is wide awake now  
For this is what I dreamed ooh  
  
This is what I dreamed  
This is what I dreamed

Sometimes late at night  
I sit beside our bed  
Watching you sleeping so sweetly  
I'm almost completely out of my head  
Every breath you breathe  
Is a work of art  
Everytime you sigh just breaks my heart  
There's no one in this whole world  
Inspires me the way that you do  
Undying admiration  
Undying admiration  
I'll sing it to the night  
I'll sing until the light  
Undying admiration  
  
And when the morning comes  
And a little child appears  
Hearing the love in your laughter  
Sometimes I just have to hold back the tears  
  
The passion on your face  
The depth of your soul  
Would inspire any muse to lose control  
There's no one in this whole world  
That teaches me the way that you do  
  
Undying admiration  
Undying admiration  
I'll write it on the sky  
And tell the world of my  
Undying admiration  
  
All my life I've waited for  
The kind of love  
Keats and Shelley would be jealous of  
And it's you baby  
You made it all come true baby  
Oh, oh  
  
Undying admiration  
Undying admiration  
I'll write it on the sky  
And tell the world of my  
Undying admiration
