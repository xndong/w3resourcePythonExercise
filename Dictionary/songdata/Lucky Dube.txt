If we both believe in Reincarnation,  
Maybe we will have a  
Chance in the next life.  
You felt something for me  
And I was so deeply in love with you.  
But we both said nothing  
Till we ran out of time  
Sometimes I cry,  
I said I cry  
And it's not because of the pain I feel inside  
And it's not because of the hurt I feel inside  
But I cry,  
I said I cry  
Sometimes I cry  
And I remember the days  
When love was so far away from me,  
The only time I knew about love was  
When mommy and daddy told me they loved me,  
And I Didn't know that today it would be  
Me having got to say I love you  
But I remember that  
Chorus  
Big boys don't cry  
And sometimes  
I cry  
I said I cry.  
And it's not because of the pain I feel inside  
And it's not because of the hurt I feel inside  
But I cry  
I see your beautiful face  
Everytime I close my eyes,  
You reach out for me I reach out for you  
But in real life we cannot meet Oh!!!!!  
That is why I cry,  
I said I cry  
And it's not because of the pain I feel inside  
And it's not because of the hurt I feel inside  
But I cry  
And I remember the days  
When love was so far away from me,  
The only time I heard about love was  
When mommy and daddy told me they loved me,  
And I didn't know that today it would be  
Me having got to say I love you,  
But I remember that  
Chorus till fade...

Trying so hard not to cry  
Since they say man ain't supposed to cry  
But these tears keep running from my eyes  
I remember the day I came to the city.  
My children were crying  
My wife was crying  
She's gonna lose me  
To the girls in the city  
To make her feel alright I  
said it's impossible  
But I was wrong  
  
[Chorus:]  
Can't blame you when you're going  
This is something you've got to do  
You've got to go ho ho.  
You've been keeping me here all these years as your private lover  
Letters came from home  
But I never answered  
'Till today when I got this letter  
From my little daughter saying  
"Missing you daddy."  
It's time to go.  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Can't blame you (as above)  
See me now, see me no more  
I heard that whistle blow  
I knew it's time to go  
Sitting here in this train  
Going so fast past the trees  
I'm thinking of words to apologize  
'Cause sorry ain't enough  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Can't blame you (till fade)

Old man sitting by the side of the road  
He's not watching the birds today  
He's not watching the sunset like he always does  
He's looking at the future  
He has seen the past  
School boy passes by interrupts his thoughts  
He said sir, can you spare me a dollar  
I got to make in time for my grade eight class  
I am fresh out of cigarettes  
And I can't be late  
The old man said  
  
[Chorus]  
The world is changing  
Take your time, look around  
Make the right decision  
  
He has no crystal ball  
But he sees the future  
Doesn't like what he sees, but what can he do  
Little girl passes by with a baby in her arms  
He thinks it's her mother's  
But no, it is her own  
She's only twelve years old for crying out loud  
With his trembling finger  
He wipes away the tears  
If this is the future, he doesn't wanna be part of it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Old man sitting by the side of his bed.  
When he goes to sleep tonight  
He won't have no sweet dreams  
He'll be haunted by ghosts from the future  
Welcome to the future.

Danny got of yellow school bus  
Looking so sad today, you see it on his face  
Mommy and Daddy have been fighting again  
Every time they fight, he's caught in the middle of it all  
He has dreams, like every little boy in the world.  
But right now his main dream,  
Is to get out of here.  
Is to see Mommy and Daddy disappear forever.  
He doesn't wanna hear those angry voices anymore  
Danny, be careful what you wish for  
You might just get it.  
Be careful O!! Oh!! Oh!!  
  
Chorus  
You can choose your friend, but you cannot  
Choose, who you related to.  
  
He goes up to his room, he's not feeling good today  
But it's no use, telling, nobody listens here  
No use complaining, nobody cares around here  
Little boys go to sleep and pray  
For toys and candy, he prays for one thing  
God I need a miracle down here  
Will you make, Mommy and Daddy?  
Disappear forever  
Danny, be careful what you wish for  
You might just, get it.  
Be careful Oh!! Oh!! Oh!!  
  
Chorus  
You can choose your friend, but you cannot  
Choose, who you related to.

They've been married  
For seventeen years  
But you can see  
She doesn't trust him at all  
And you can see she doesn't believe that he is not cheating  
You can't blame a poor girl  
He's been a busy man all his life, just like the rest of us  
One day she caught him with another girl  
He said it was his mother  
She caught with another one  
He said it was his sister  
He's in deep water again  
I don't know what he gonna say today but  
I won't be surprise if he gets out of this one like the other ones  
Cause I know he's the Houdini  
Of cheaters, hear him now when he says  
  
[Chorus]  
Cool down baby everything is under control  
It doesn't matter where I get my appetite  
I will always eat at home [Repeat: x2]  
Oh, oh  
  
They've been married for seventeen years  
But you can see  
He doesn't trust her at all  
And you can see he doesn't believe  
She's not cheating  
You can't blame a poor man  
She's been a busy girl  
All her life just like the rest of us  
One day he caught her with another man  
She said it was her father  
He caught her with another one  
She said it was her brother  
I believe that it is true  
Birds of a feather fly together  
She has learned from master  
I wasn't surprise at all  
When I heard her say hey  
  
[Chorus]

So far so good we still living today  
But we don't know what tomorrow brings  
In this crazy world  
People dying like flies every day  
You read about it in the news  
But you don't believe it  
You'll only know about it  
When the man in the long black coat  
Knocks on your door  
'Cause you're his next victim  
As you are living in this  
  
Living in, living in this crazy world  
Living in, living in this crazy world  
Living in, living in this crazy world  
Living in, living in this crazy world  
  
Leaders starting wars every time they want  
Some for their rights,  
Some for fun and their own glory letting people die for the wrong that they do  
Oh it's painful come on now little boy  
Say your prayers before you sleep  
Little boy went down on his knees  
And he said  
  
Living in, living in this crazy world  
Living in, living in this crazy world  
Living in, living in this crazy world  
Living in, living in this crazy world

Is it the bodyguards around you  
Is it the high walls where you live  
Or is it the men with the guns around you  
Twenty four hours a day  
That make you ignore the crying of the people  
Farmers get killed everyday  
And you say it is not that bad  
Policemen get killed everyday  
And you say it is not that bad  
Maybe if you see it through the eyes  
Of the victims  
You will join us and fight this  
  
[Chorus:]  
Crime and corruption  
  
Do you ever worry  
About your house being broken into  
Do you ever worry  
About your car being taken away from you  
In broad daylight  
Down highway 54  
Do you ever worry  
About your wife becoming  
The woman in black  
Do you ever worry  
About leaving home and  
Coming back in a coffin  
With a bullet through your head  
So join us and fight this  
  
[Chorus:]  
Crime and corruption

It seems like it only happened yesterday  
Now that I think about it  
Tears cannot bring you joy  
But joy can bring you tears  
Even though I cry today  
I will not hide it  
It is for a different reason  
That is why I'll shout it out  
For the world to hear  
I say, "Hello, hello happiness  
Oh Jah, thank you  
For another day"  
I say  
"Ding ding licky licky licky bong  
Ding ding licky licky licky bong"  
Ding ding licky licky licky bong  
Ding ding licky licky licky bong  
I say  
"Ding ding licky licky licky bong  
Ding ding licky licky licky bong"  
Ding ding licky licky licky bong  
Ding ding licky licky licky bong  
Ding ding licky licky licky bong  
Another tear drop falls  
But I don't care  
I took a wrong turn in life before  
But I've paid my dues  
Objects in the rear view mirror  
They appear closer than they are  
If you don't talk the talk  
Don't walk the walk  
If you won't please, don't tease  
Another lesson learned  
I'm gonna shout it out again  
"Hello, hello happiness  
Oh God, thank you  
For another chance"  
There is no future in the past  
So shout it out  
"Ding ding licky licky licky bong  
Ding ding licky licky licky bong"  
Ding ding licky licky licky bong  
Ding ding licky licky licky bong  
"Ding ding licky licky licky bong  
Ding ding licky licky licky bong"  
Ding ding licky licky licky bong  
Ding ding licky licky licky bong  
They say  
"Ding ding licky licky licky bong"  
Hey Ringo come and dance with me  
Come on, come on

Come and spend my shoes  
Hey Greek women

We see them everyday  
Movin' up and down  
Holding their bibles in their hands yeah  
Going to church every Sunday  
Telling people they're Christians yeah  
Ye man, we read in the Bible  
And over stand  
It's telling us of all the false prophets  
When the Messiah's  
Gonna come down here  
Them a gonna' say these words  
Jesus I want to be like you  
  
[Chorus:]  
False prophets lies and elution  
  
A dem a go around  
Lamping da creation yeah

I and I no like da Babylon style  
Cause' dem a go around lampin' Jah creation  
Dem a go around telling dem lies  
Jesus I want to be like you  
  
[Chorus]

How long shall you carry  
That burden on your shoulders?  
How long shall those tears  
Keep rolling down  
Your beautiful face?  
We all have troubles  
Now and again, know what I'm saying?  
  
[Chorus]  
No matter how hard we try,  
Trouble will find us one way or another.  
People had trouble since the pope  
Was an alter boy  
People had worries from when the  
Dead sea was only critical.  
Hear those drums rolling  
Listen to those guitars skanking  
Yeah... Put a smile on your face  
Don't let the troubles get you down,  
Let me tell you how we feel...  
  
We feel irie  
Do you feel like we do  
  
No man can hide from his fears  
Since they are part of him  
They'll always know where to find him,  
Come on and walk tall and  
Keep your head high  
  
I tell you again and again  
Put a smile on your face,  
Don't let the troubles  
Get you down  
  
[Chorus until fade]

I've been sitting here for many days now  
They've been looking for me for many days too  
From where I' m sitting  
I can see their angry faces  
It' s only a matter of time  
They' ll be on to me  
The sirens, helicopters and tings  
The bloodhounds are on my tail, Oh God  
Just in minutes  
They' ll be tearing me apart  
If I don' t do now  
What I've been doing all my life  
I' ll be running...all my life  
  
[Chorus:]  
I' m the running man  
The fugitive  
  
Seeking political asylum is not easy down here FONT

In the middle of the night I heard her pray  
So bitterly and so softly, yeah  
She prayed for her children  
She prayed for their education  
Then she prayed for the man  
That left her with her children  
We praise heroes everyday  
But there are those that we forget to praise  
The women of this world  
They don't run from anything  
They stand and fight for what's right  
Oh oh oh  
God bless the women  
Even when times are so hard  
They are so cool, calm and collected  
They don't run from anything  
They stand and fight for what is right  
They do not run from responsibilities  
They stand and fight for what Is right  
Oh oh oh  
God bless the women  

When you were a little girl  
I had dreams and I had plans for you  
As a single father I knew  
There was gonna be turbulance  
Along the way  
I did not know that so soon  
I' d have to stand on the side  
Watch you go through life  
Without my guidance you see  
I wanted to be there when you cry  
I wanted to be there when you smile  
I wanted to be there when you play  
I wanted to be there all your life  
I would say it' s wrong  
She' d say it' s right  
Words got spoken since  
I live in a glass house  
I didn't want no stones to be thrown  
I didn't want no blows to be thrown  
But I would hate to see my...  
  
[Chorus:]  
Good girl go bad  
Good girl go bad  
  
The games we played  
The rhymes you taught me  
Everything we did together  
Those were the best days of my life  
I will always remember  
The little girl you were once  
I wanted to be there when you cry  
I wanted to be there when you smile  
I wanted to be there when you play  
I wanted to be there all your life  
I would say it' s right  
She' d say it' s wrong  
I would say it' s wrong  
She' d say it' s right  
Words got spoken since  
I live in a glass house  
I didn't want no stones to be thrown  
I didn't want no blows to be thrown  
But I would hate to see my...  
  
[Chorus:]  
Good girl go bad  
Good girl go bad

There will be a time in your life  
When you'll need me the most  
But I won't be there  
There will be a time in your life  
When you won't need me at all  
I won't be there  
But while I've got the chance  
I'm gonna tell you what I know  
About this world we're living in  
It may seem so beautiful  
From where you are  
It may look so innocent  
In your eyes  
But let me tell you  
It's not a bed of roses  
  
Good things come to those  
Who got out and made them happen  
They don't come to those who wait  
  
Good things come to those  
Who got out and made them happen  
They don't come to those who wait  
  
Good things come to those  
Who got out and made them happen  
They don't come to those who wait  
  
I can sit here and teach you  
Every trick in the book  
But at the end of the day  
It is your life  
  
Good things come to those  
Who got out and made them happen  
They don't come to those who wait  
  
Good things come to those  
Who got out and made them happen  
They don't come to those who wait  
  
Good things come to those  
Who got out and made them happen  
They don't come to those who wait  
  
You don't have to worry  
The future is in your hands

There's lady that I love so much  
She's always on my mind, night and day  
But people told me she's in love  
With another guy in town  
This news makes me so sad  
I'm confused, I don't know what to do about it  
How will I know if she loves me  
I'm confused  
How will I know if she loves me  
Does she really care for me  
How will I know if she loves me  
I'm confused  
I've tried to get her off my mind  
But the love she gives to me, draws me every time  
I've tried to get her off my mind  
But the love she gives to me is so strong  
Each time when we were together  
She use to tell me that I'm the only guy  
[I felt this myself to this woman]?  
Now I'm so confused  
People told me she's in love  
With another guy in town  
This really makes me so sad  
I'm confused  
What am I going to do about it?  
Oh God  
Does she really care for me  
How will I know if she loves me

I've got to take a little time  
A little time to think things over  
I'd better read between the lines  
In case I need it when I'm older  
  
This big mountain, I must climb  
Feels like the world upon my shoulders  
Through the crowds, I see love shine  
It keeps me warm as life grows colder  
  
In my life, there's been heartache and pain  
I don't know if I can face it again  
I can't stop now  
I've traveled so far  
To change this lonely life  
  
[Chorus]  
I want to know what love is  
Reggae can show me  
I want to feel what love is  
Reggae can show me  
  
I'm going to take a little time  
A little time to look around me  
I've got nowhere left to hide  
It looks like reggae has finally found me  
  
In my life, there's been heartache and pain  
I don't know if I can face it again  
I can't stop now  
I've traveled so far  
To change this lonely life  
  
[Chorus]

[Chorus:]  
Jah live Jah children  
Let Rastas never die  
  
When everything is going right  
They forget about your presents  
But when the tables turn upside down  
They know that you're there  
  
To my mom who taught me  
That you're always there  
I wrote this little  
Song of praise  
Now I'm gonna sing  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The Rastaman call him Jah  
Some people call him Allah  
English man call Him God  
But he is one  
  
We may have different names  
To call him, but he cares  
For everyone that's why I  
Wrote this song

Throws the bones, tells the future

In the early days of December  
Saying she wasn' t happy  
Where she was  
Oh that' s the bad news yeah  
That is why today I' m here  
To take her away from you  
Everytime you treat her badly  
It brings back memories and  
We don' t want  
To see her go through  
Hurt again so!!!  
  
Chorus:  
Keep on knocking but you  
Can' t come in now  
  
She' s my mother you know  
If she was a bad mother  
She would have thrown us away  
Long time ago  
Even when things got bad  
She still held onto us all the way  
When she cries we cry too  
When she smiles we smile too  
We were happy all this time  
Until you came along  
Everytime you treat her badly  
It brings back memories and  
We don' t want to see her  
Go through hurt again  
  
Chorus till fade  
  
  

She wanted to be like her mother in many ways  
The way she walks, the way she smiles  
Over and above all  
The way she brushes her hair back  
She heard it all being said to her  
Saw it all happeneing in her life  
Like every woman  
She's been trapped in this fairy tale  
Find a frog, kiss it  
And hope it would turn into a handsome prince  
How many frogs had she kissed in her life  
None of them turned into a handsome prince  
The little girl made a decision in her life, oh  
And she promised to keep it  
  
I'm gonna kiss no frog  
  
Everything went the way she wanted  
Every dream was what she wanted  
But when it came to finding someone  
To spend her life with  
Same old story  
  
Find a frog, kiss it  
And hope it'll turn into a prince, oh  
Better to be alone and happy  
Then being with someone and being unhappy  
All your life  
  
I'm gonna kiss no frog

Even though his times are hard  
You can hardly see it on his face  
Because of the smile  
People coming in from miles away  
To hear him sing and see him play  
So he can' t disappoint them now  
The room is full of smoke  
But he can see them dancing  
And he can see them crying  
It doesn' t bother him at all 'Cause he knows it' s only tears of joy  
  
[Chorus:]  
Let the band play on  
  
There' s a girl sitting by the corner there  
And she looks at him with her big brown eyes  
He smiles back and carries on playing  
It doesn' t bother him at all  
Somehow, it gives him some comfort  
Police came in halfway through the night  
With the good news  
Neighbors are complaining  
'Cause the music is so low low low low  
So turn it up, now  
  
[Chorus:]  
Let the band play on

Warning, this is the chief of police speaking  
Do not steal police hate competition  
Where we gonna run, where we gonna hide?  
You've got the right to remain silent  
But forever they were brought here to protect us  
They were brought here not to hurt  
But now they hurt us everyday  
You see, police have joined  
Forces with criminals  
Don't steal, police hate competition  
We can't sit down, something must be done  
Catching the bad guys in real life  
Is not as easy as it is in the movies  
We see James Bond  
(007)  
Eddie Murphy  
(Beverly Hills Cop)  
Chasing bad guys all the time  
But police in real life have joined  
Forces with criminals  
Don't steal, police hate competition  
We can't sit down something must be done  
Our life has got to be like  
Life in the movies  
Where the good guys always  
Win in the end  
Life in the movies  
How can we expect them  
To serve and protect the community?  
If they themselves are the bad guys  
Police have joined forces with criminals  
Stand up and fight, no one is safe  
Life in the movies  
Life in the movies  
Life in the movies  
...  

Little heroes, go down  
The drain day by day  
Future leaders they go down  
The drains day by day  
They cry so loud yeah  
But the whole world  
Is not listening  
Only you mothers of the world  
Can save the children  
There' s a lot of things  
To be legalised yeah  
But abortion is not an  
Important thing here  
  
How can you have a face  
Of an angel  
And let the devil insideof you  
Take control  
We tired of hearing these  
Little voices crying out  
From far away saying  
  
Chorus:  
Mama why do you  
Destroy me  
Mama what have I done  
To you  
I deserve to live like  
Anybody else  
We all come in this world  
Not knowing where we gonna go  
We all come in this world  
Not knowing where life is  
Gonna take us  
  
Give them a chance in life  
We' re all taking our changes here  
Life life life the greatest gift of all  
I see the government officials  
Sitting around a table  
There' s a law they gonna pass  
Only you the mothers of  
The world can save the children  
  
Women' s leagues  
All over the world  
Fighting for women' s liberation  
But who fights for  
The children' s liberation  
We are tired of hearing  
These little voices saying  
  
Chorus till fade  
  

Who' s child am I gonna be tonight?  
Who' s bed am I gonna sleep in tonight?  
You told the other ones  
I was your brother's child  
You told the ones  
I was your sister's child  
Everytime they come to the house  
I got to change my name  
Everytime they come to the house  
I got to change my identity  
Whose child am I gonna be tonight?  
As he walked away with tears in his eyes  
I felt every pain that he felt  
I cried every tear that he cried  
Mama why?......  
  
[Chorus:]  
I wish you could love me the way I am  
  
Whose dogs are gonna be my friends tonight?  
Whose bin am I gonna eat out of tonight?  
The welfare people when they come  
To the house you told me to say nothing  
Every time they want to take me away  
You say everything is alright  
who's bins am I gonna eat out of tonight?  
As he walked away with tears in his eyes  
I felt every pain that he felt  
I cried every tear that he cried  
Mama why?.......  
  
[Chorus:]  
I wish you could love me the way I am

He built this wall around himself  
Many years ago  
To protect himself from being hurt again  
But he couldn' t stop his feelings  
Last night yeah  
When he saw the young lady in the bar  
Blonde hair, blue eyes  
Waited till the band played the last song  
And took her home  
His mother didn' t like her  
His father didn' t like her  
The only thing that kept them  
Going was knowing that  
Love would conquer all  
  
Chorus:  
They were lovers  
In a dangerous time  
  
They ran away to another country  
'Cause they thought things would be  
Better for them out there  
In the month of December  
They got married in Chicago  
And it was all the same  
Everywhere they went  
Heads would turn  
  
Chorus till fade  
  
  

Standing alone, in the middle of the city  
Man looks around him  
He hardly recognizes what he sees  
Cause he' s a man from the past  
Two thousand years ago  
This was his home  
Rivers used to run here  
Birds used to fly around here  
But now it is a different jungle  
A concrete jungle  
  
[Chorus:]  
He' s a lonely man  
In the middle of the city  
Missing home so badly  
  
Man' s own creation  
Has become his worst enemy  
Weapons of destruction  
Have brought about  
Human extinction...wo...ho  
Two thousand years ago  
This was his home  
But now it is  
A different jungle  
A concrete jungle  
  
[Chorus:]  
He' s a lonely man  
In the middle of the city  
Missing home so badly

When I look in the mirror  
It' s your face I see  
Even when I go to sleep at night  
It' s your face I see  
You are the one to congratulate me  
When I' ve done right  
You are the last to criticize me  
When I' ve done wrong  
You are the star of my show  
Oh...man...oh...man  
I don' t know where to start to thank you  
Everything I own I owe it to you  
  
[Chorus:]  
The man in the mirror  
  
When there' s decisions  
To be made  
You leave it up to me  
I leave it up to you  
And whatever you decide is alright with me  
Some people say you' re so difficult to live with  
Oh my, oh my  
But I know different  
Follow me I' m right behind you  
I don' t know where how to thank you  
This happiness I have  
I owe it all to you  
  
[Chorus:]  
Man in the mirror...

Put his coat on his shoulders and slowly he walked away  
Behind him he could hear  
Those innocent voices  
Crying out so bitterly saying  
We did not start the war But we fighting now  
We did not start the fire  
But we burning now  
They were told many years ago that their country is free  
But they didn't understand  
That it's not real  
They never knew it was a  
Chorus:  
Mickey Mouse freedom independence  
Me come ina you country  
That is said to be free (x2)  
Me sight corruption.  
Me sight starvation  
Walking like a millionaire 'cause you think you country is free  
One thing you don't know is that your country is being remote controlled  
Chorus:  
Mickey Mouse freedom independence (till fade)

Billy old Billy, Billy old Billy  
Man with the words of wisdom  
They found his long black coat  
On the banks of the river  
'Cause he never came back  
In it's pocket they found notes  
He'd written some time ago  
About his so called friends  
It read, love all your friends  
But never trust any one of them  
Which got me thinking about  
My very own friends  
Mirror, mirror, on the wall  
Who is the deadliest of them all  
I ask you now, tears in my eyes  
Billy old Billy, Billy old Billy  
Man with the words of wisdom  
See them coming  
Hear them talk  
Never believe a word they say  
He told me one day  
Even behind the smile  
That he wore on his wrinkled face  
Everyday, you could see the scars  
Of hurt from the past  
Which got me thinking of  
My very own, so called friend  
Mirror mirror on the wall  
Who is the deadliest of them all  
I ask you now, tears in my eyes  
Mirror mirror on the wall  
Who is the deadliest of them all  
I ask you now, tears in my eyes  
Mirror mirror on the wall  
Who is the deadliest of them all  
I ask you now, tears in my eyes

I had a dream last night  
One that will stay with me for a long time  
One that will stay with me,  
For as long as I live.  
We were living in a world, there was no pain  
We were living in the world there were no hungry people  
Everyone was at peace with one another  
  
There was a man in my dream  
He told me he's from the future,  
Coming to give something better [Repeat x3]  
Even though I that  
  
[Chorus]  
One monster dies another one comes alive.  
  
I had a dream last night  
It was my dream but I know it is a dream  
Of a lot of people in the world  
To be living in a world, with no homeless people  
To be living in a world where little children  
Don't have to die, because their parents are poor  
When we came to this world  
We were prepared to fight a battle.  
But we found a war  
When we came to this world,  
We were prepared to fight demons  
But we found the devil himself  
  
There was a man in my dream  
He told me he's here  
To gimme something better  
Even though I know that,  
  
[Chorus]

Your smiling cannot fool me no more  
Your sweet talking cannot fool me no more  
'Cause I know about your cheating  
'Cause I know about you back biting  
And I don't know what you know  
And I have never been where you've been  
And I certainly don't believe in what you believe in  
And I don't do what you do  
I'm a living witness, now I know that  
Not every black man is my brother  
Not every white man is my enemy  
I've got no place in your world  
And I've never been where you've been  
And I don't know what you know  
And I have never been where you've been  
And I certainly don't believe in what you believe in  
And I don't do what you do  
I'm a living witness, now I know that  
Not every black man is my brother  
Not every white man is my enemy  
I've got no place in your world  
And I've never been where you've been  
Not every black man is my brother  
Not every white man is my enemy  
I've got no place in your world  
And I've never been where you've been  
Not every black man is my brother  
Not every white man is my enemy  
I've got no place in your world  
And I've never been where you've been

We were only eighteen years old  
Didn't know much about anything  
The only thing we knew was this love  
That we have for each other  
You were the millionaire's daughter  
I was the grave digger's son  
They told me to keep away from you  
They told you to stay away from me  
Look at us now, we are living our dreams  
Which goes to say, love is thicker than blood.  
Love is thicker than blood.  
Love is thicker than blood.  
Take your time, take your time  
Take your time don't hurry  
We have all aternity ahead of us.  
Chorus  
I will never, I will never leave you.  
No matter what happenes, no matter where life  
Takes us, I will never leave you.  
Take your time take your time love me  
Take your time, we have all etrnity ahead of us.  
You had a chance to be, with anyone you want  
You chose to be with me.  
Even though you knew, I had nothing to my name  
You still love me  
You were the millionaire's daughter  
I was the grave digger's son,  
They told me to keep away from you  
They told you to stay away from me  
Look at us now, we are living our dreams  
Which goes to say, love is thicker than blood  
Love is thicker than blood.  
Take your time take your time  
Take your time love me  
We have all eternity ahead of us  
Chorus  
I will never, I will never leave you, I will never,  
I will never leave you  
No matter what happenes, No matter where life  
Takes us, I will never leave you.  
  

No glove, no love  
You've been hearing this so many times  
Don't you think it's time  
To be a little more responsible  
Too many people die these days, oh  
If you read the papers, check out the news  
The numbers are there  
Every number, represents a human being  
Who was a father, who was a mother  
A son or a daughter of this land...oh  
You don't make the commitment but your body does  
Even if you're dead silent  
  
[Chorus:]  
You are here today, tomorrow you are gone  
You don't want to be another number in the book (x3)  
  
In the shadows of the night  
A lady from the street corner talks to a customer  
Money exchanges hands  
That's the formality and she says  
No glove, no love  
You can pay me well, but it ain't worth my life  
Too many people die these days  
If you read the papers, check out the news  
The numbers are there  
Every number, represents a human being  
Who was a father, who was a mother  
A son or a daughter of this land...oh  
It ain't worth my life...oh

Oh my son, I am sorry about what happened  
Many years ago  
Me and your mother had trouble all the time  
We could not stay together any more  
The last solution was getting divorced  
I know what that means to your life  
I can hear you crying  
From a million miles away  
Calling "Daddy" but there 's no answer  
But deep down in me I know the reason why  
''cause the blood that runs in you  
Is the same as the blood in me  
I mean the blood, the blood that runs in you  
Is the same as the blood in me  
Oh my son I' m sorry  
Oh my son I' m sorry  
Oh my son I' m sorry  
I can hear you crying  
From a million miles away  
Calling "Daddy" but there 's no answer  
But deep down in me I know the reason why  
''cause the blood that runs in you  
Is the same as the blood in me  
I mean the blood, the blood that runs in you  
Is the same as the blood in me  
''cause the blood that runs in you  
Is the same as the blood in me  
I say the blood, the blood that runs in you

How do you feel when you lie?  
Straight faced while people cry  
How do you feel when you promise something  
That you know you'll never do  
Giving false hope to the people  
Giving false hope to the underpriviledged  
Do you really sleep at night?  
When you know you're living a lie  
To you it is just a job  
To the people it hurts to the bone  
Chorus  
Ooh political games that they play x 4  
What do you say to the orphans?  
Of the women and men you sent to war  
What do you say to the widows?  
Of the men you sent to war  
Telling them it is good for the country  
When you know it's good for your ego  
What a shame.  
Do you really sleep at night?  
When you know you're living a lie  
You talking tough, you talking sincerely  
Giving false hope to the infected  
Giving false hope to the affected.  
To you it is just a job  
To the people it hurts to the bone.  
Chorus  
Ooh political games that they play  
Reap till fade.  
  

Somebody told me about it  
When I was still a little boy  
He said to me, crime does not pay  
He said to me, education is the key, yeah  
As a little boy I thought I know  
What I was doing, yeah man  
But today here I am in jail  
  
I' m a prisoner  
I' m a prisoner  
I' m a prisoner  
  
I looked all around me  
But to see nothing  
but four grey walls staring at me  
the policeman said to me, son  
They won' t build no schools anymore  
All they' ll build will be prison, prison  
All they' ll build will be prison, prison  
All they' ll build will be prison, prison  
'Cause today, yeah  
  
I am a prisoner  
I am a prisoner  
I' m a prisoner  
Dear lord  
  
I asked the policeman and said  
How much must I pay for my freedom?  
He said to me, son  
They won't build no schools anymore  
They won't build no hospitals  
They won't build no hospitals  
All they' ll build will be prison, prison  
All they' ll build will be prison, prison  
All they' ll build will be prison, prison  
All they' ll build will be prison, prison  
  
I am a prisoner  
I am a prisoner  
I' m a prisoner  
Dear lord

Somewhere between heaven and earth  
That is where you will find real freedom  
We've been waiting for so long for this freedom  
When other freedom fighters  
Puppet master, marching soldier  
Fought of the rights of the people  
You fought for the right to  
Abuse people, that is why I call you  
Puppet master  
Marching soldier  
I was a little boy when it happened  
But I can still hear those killing machines  
Roaring like thunder  
Roaring like hungry lions  
And they don't only hurt us physically  
And they don't only hurt us politically  
But they hurt us mentally  
Puppet master  
Marching soldier  
Puppet master  
Marching soldier  
Puppet master  
Marching soldier

There comes a time  
In every man's life  
Where he's got to face  
The truth no matter what  
We are coming to you, Father  
With our sins and everything  
To thank you  
Those that smoke marijuana  
Wanna thank you, Father  
For making it grow internationally  
They wanna thank you, Lord  
Even though police cut it down  
Sometimes they burn it down  
But it grows again  
Thank you, Father  
We wanna thank you father  
For everything you've given us  
Nations that oppress other nations  
Wanna thank you, Father  
Even though it's painful to be oppressed  
But they thank you for making them strong  
Politicians thank you, Father  
For making them to be able  
To lie with a straight face  
While the nation cries  
They wanna thank you, Lord  
We wanna thank you, Father  
For everything you've given us  
We wanna thank you, Father  
For everything you've given us  
We wanna thank you, Father  
For everything you've given us

We hear you crying  
So bitterly  
Trying to get people to help you ye ye  
But nobody will  
Your son was brutalizing people everytime.  
But you said nothing  
Now it's the time to pay the price  
It's time to pay ye ye ye ye  
  
[Chorus:]  
You gonna reap just what you sow (x4)  
  
Coming back home  
With stolen things  
Instead of telling him  
How wrong he was  
You told him how clever he was  
People coming out of burning houses  
It's your son Driving stolen cars every time  
It's your son,  
But you said nothing  
But now he's turning against you  
  
[Chorus:]  
You gonna reap just what you sow (x3)  
  
Everybody knows  
No jail can keep him  
'Cause you rubbing shoulders with the law  
But now it's time to pay the price wo... woh

Reggae in the bathroom, reggae in the bedroom  
Reggae everywhere, reggae in jail, reggae in church  
Everybody likes it they tried to kill it many years ago  
Killing the prophets of reggae  
Destroying the prophets of reggae  
But somebody said to all the bald heads  
Respect the Rastaman 'cause he's the only one  
Only one left in Jah creation  
Nobody can stop reggae  
Nobody can stop reggae  
Nobody can stop reggae  
'cause reggae's strong  
You can change the style of playing reggae  
You can change the rhythm of playing reggae  
But never ever change the message every time I play it a Babylon  
A wish me fe dead, a wish me fe dead  
They tried to destroy it many years ago  
Killing the prophets of reggae  
Killing the prophets of reggae  
But somebody said to all the bald heads  
Nobody can stop reggae  
Nobody can stop reggae  
Nobody can stop reggae  
'cause reggae's strong  
Nobody can stop reggae  
Nobody can stop reggae  
Nobody can stop reggae

You don't have to come with me  
Down this road  
'Cause I know my way around here  
Very well  
It may not seem like it  
From where you stand  
But believe you me  
I know what I'm talking about  
Letting it all go  
Didn't matter to me  
'Cause I've done it all before  
  
But when you left  
Part of me went with you  
That is why I call you now  
On this phone  
So please, oh please  
Don't hang up on me  
  
Release me, let me go  
Release me, let me go  
Release me, let me go  
But remember that  
Some bridges never burn  
  
You took your way  
And I took mine  
We were sure our ways  
Will never meet again  
Every time I go out  
With another man  
I find myself calling your name  
Now I know that it's true  
  
What they say  
Sometimes love  
Never knows when to die  
When you went  
Part of me went with you  
That's why I called you on the phone  
  
Release me, let me go  
Remember that  
Some bridges never burn

[Chorus:]  
Daddy where ever you are remember me  
In what ever you, do I love you  
Daddy where ever you are remember me  
In what ever you do, I love you  
  
You left for the city many years ago  
Promised to come back  
And take care of us  
Many years have gone by now  
Still no sign of you Daddy  
  
Mother died of a heart attack  
Many years ago when she heard  
That you were married again  
Now, I'm the only one left in the family  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Wandering up and down  
The streets of Soweto  
No place to call my home  
I tried to find you  
Many years ago  
But the woman you're married to  
was no good at all  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Daddy yo'

When you flash that badge  
You want everyone to shiver  
When you flash that badge  
You want everyone to worship you  
I got no time to worship human kind  
I only worship the All Mighty  
Through his prophets I have learned  
To give respect to everything he created  
I give love to those who love me  
Love those who gimme war  
I love those who hate me  
I bless even those who curse me yeah [Repeat x2]  
  
[Chorus]  
Gimme gimme respect  
Show me show me respect  
  
You could be the president  
You could be his deputy  
You don't even have to know  
My political affiliation  
You don't even have to know  
My religious affiliation  
Respect me, for who I am  
And not what I am  
Nobody even cares about your dollars  
Nobody even cares about your bling bling  
  
Give love to those who give you love  
Give love to those who give you war  
Give love to those who hate you  
Bless even those who curse you, yeah [Repeat x2]

Call me when you' re ready yeah  
Call me when your head is right  
She said the words and walked into the sunset  
Like a cowboy  
He was standing there like he got up  
From a bad dream  
And he said she wanted something  
He could not give her (commitment)  
He is one of the men I know  
Who have chosen loneliness  
And called it freedom  
That' s why he always says  
  
[Chorus:]  
I' m a rolling stone  
'Cause a rolling stone  
Gathers no moss  
  
She told him once before  
She' s not getting any younger you know  
And when you look at her face  
The years are showing  
She is one of the women I know  
Who wants it all in life (commitment)  
He is one of the men I know  
Who've taken loneliness  
And called it freedom  
That' s why he always says  
  
[Chorus:]  
I' m a rolling stone  
'Cause a rolling stone  
Gathers no moss

Something somewhere  
Is calling out your name  
In the middle of the night  
Your eyes go wide  
I see your legs shaking  
  
You don't believe it's happening  
Oppressor man ye  
  
Don't tell me you are scared now  
It's not the end of your life  
But it's the end of your kingdom  
It's not the end of your life  
But it's the end of your shitty kingdom  
  
Oppressor man you running  
Your kingdom is falling  
Your kingdom is falling  
Your kingdom is falling  
Yo Yo Yo Yo  
  
You run for your gun  
To your surprise it's empty  
'Cause we had those bullets  
For breakfast Jah children did ye ye ye  
Teargas won't make me cry anymore  
Your handcuffs won't hurt my arms anymore  
  
It's not the end of your life but it's the end of your kingdom  
It's not the end of your life  
But it's the end of your shitty kingdom  
  
Oppressor man you running  
Your Kingdom's falling  
Your Kingdom's falling  
Your Kingdom's falling  
  
I won't do to you  
What you did to my people ye  
Four hundred years ago  
Four hundred years ago  
Turning them to slaves  
Making them your prisoners  
  
You can run but you can't hide  
Your time has come now now now  
  
Oppressor man you running  
Your kingdom's falling

We've been talking about it  
Where it came from?  
We've been talking about it  
How it started?  
Wait a minute  
It doesn't matter now  
Where it came from  
And how it started?  
But what matters is

And we know where it's going, oh, yeah

It wasn't the valley of death, I was walking in  
It was the valley of confusion for many years  
Different religions, different beliefs  
Undermining my culture  
Looking down upon my tradition  
Making fun of my language  
Telling my children, they have no God  
Finally I can tell them about,  
Shembe is the way  
Chorus  
Oh SHEMBE thank you for showing us the way.  
Shembe nobunazaretha.  
Oh SHEMBE thank you for healing my people.  
Shembe nobunazaretha.  
Shemebe is the way.  
I hear them shoulting Amen,  
At the top of the mountain  
I hear them shouting Uyingcwele  
At the top of the mountain.  
No one will undermine my religion  
No one will undermine my culture anymore,  
Cause God sent him from above, to be with the people.  
Bring them back to what is their own  
Take them back to the ways Of our forefathers.  
Finally I can tell generations and generations  
That Shembe is the way  
Chorus  
Oh Shemebe THANK YOU FOR SHOWING US THE WAY.  
Shembe Nobunazaretha.

I'm ready to be happy  
I've been down too long  
It's time to rise above it all  
I put a big smile across my face as  
I walk down joy street yeah  
Follow me if you can  
But leave all the burdens behind  
Don't look to the past  
It'll make you pasteristik  
Look to the future  
It'll make you futuristik  
Hey mister! Hey sir!  
Don't open that cupboard  
I don't want no skeletons falling out  
I don't want no bones falling out  
I don't want my past  
Catching up with me  
'Cause I' m happy oh...  
  
[Chorus:]  
Let sleeping dogs lie  
  
I see two men in the street  
Holding hands and kissing  
The other one looks  
The other one smiles  
When the other one smiles  
The other one blushes  
I didn't want to know  
What's going on  
As long as they' re happy  
I don' t want to look up to politicians  
They' re gonna feed me  
Political bull  
And I will have  
Political diarrhea  
Don't look to the past  
It'll make you pasteristik  
(Don' t look it up)  
(Me just made it up)  
Look to the future  
It'll make you futuristik  
Hey mister! Hey sir!  
Don't open that cupboard  
I don't want no bones falling out  
  
[Chorus]

Soldier  
Stand for the truth you stand alone  
Government will cover up  
I saw a man sitting in a room  
Holding a gun to his head  
He said man, oh man  
What am I gonna do  
I can't change the past but I can change the future  
If I pull this trigger right now, right here  
Everything will be over  
Not a day goes by I don't see them in my dreams  
Not a day goes by I don't hear them screaming in my ears  
Begging for mercy, pleading innocent  
Since my heart is made up to be as cold  
As the barrel of this gun I hold  
I would pull the trigger anyway  
  
Chorus  
I was a soldier, following instructions from a man  
We have known as the general  
So many medals, so many praises  
Nothing can take away the guilt  
That I feel inside me  
Government covered up every crime we committed  
Against human kind  
Not a day goes by, I don't see them in my dreams  
Not a day goes by, I don't hear them crying in my ears

Teacher teacher teacher  
Ever since we came to town

Warned you about  
We are those men your oppressive father

Chorus till fade  
  
  

Walking in the darkness  
Like a predator from the wild  
Looking for those who are gasping  
For the last breath to take them away  
Some to a better place  
Some to a place where  
The fires never stop burning  
You can cry for help  
No one is listening  
'Cause everyone is deaf  
From the death that is surrounding them  
No angel takes you home  
No angel takes you to heaven  
But the soul taker comes  
And takes your soul away  
His eyes shines wild fire  
And he' s here to take you away  
He' s the......  
  
[Chorus:]  
Soul taker, soul taker  
Soul taker takes your soul  
You gotta be ready

All this pain in this world  
All the crying in this world  
I'll take it to Jah  
All the worries in the world  
And all the troubles in this world  
I will take to Jah  
  
All the suffering  
Right where we are  
I'll take to my father  
  
'Cause he said  
Come to I with all thine sins  
And I will wash away  
All the impurities  
He said I'm your father  
The creator of everything  
That's what I say  
  
(CHORUS):  
All this pain I'll take to Jah [2x]  
All these worries I'll take to Jah [2x]  
  
Come to I with your problems  
No problem too big or small  
No one, no one will be rejected  
I'm your father the creator  
  
OH-HO-HO-HO Lord I cry [2x]  
  
Even when Satan comes  
With him demons  
Turn everything I believed in  
Upside down  
I will never forget  
With Jah on our side  
Who can be against us  
Oh no  
Most high omnipotent one  
Praise him most high  
  
(CHORUS): [TO END]  
All this pain I'll take to Jah  
All this crying I'll take to Jah

I pay my gardener to clean up my garden  
I pay my doctor to check out da other ting  
I pay my lawyer to fight for my rights  
And I pay my bodyguard to guard my body  
There's only one man I pay  
But I don't know what I'm paying for  
I'm talking about the taxman

You even take from me, can't understand it now  
I pay for the police to, err...I don't know why  
'Cause if my dollar was good enough  
There wouldn't be so much crime in the streets  
They tell me you're a fat man  
And you always take and never give  
  
What have you done for me lately  
Mr Taxman

It takes a million people  
To build up a good reputation  
But it takes one stupid fool  
To destroy everything they done  
The world knows your people as  
The most violent in the world  
The world knows your nation as  
The most oppressive in the world  
Take it upon yourself  
To restore your nation's dignity  
Yo ho ho ho ho ho ho  
  
Teach the world  
Teach them right  
  
It takes a million lives  
To get the respect you deserve  
When people see your kind  
Some of them would run a mile  
The world knows your people as  
A nation of crooks  
Everyone around you should  
Always keep their eyes opened  
The world knows your nation as  
A nation of drug lords  
Everyone blames your people  
For the destruction of the world  
Take it upon yourself  
To restore your nation's dignity  
Ho ho ho ho ho ho  
  
Teach the world  
Teach them right  
Teach the world  
Teach them right  
Teach the world  
Teach them right

You opened up your moth with bated breath  
You said you'd never leave me

You're cryin' me a river but I got to get across  
Lovin' you has got to be

Oh honey, best believe it  
To save a lot of time and foolish pride

You love me, you hate me, you cut me down to size  
You blinded me with love and, yeah, it opened up my eyes

The kind that likes to leap without a shove  
Honey, you best believe it  
Now I ain't one for saying long goodbyes  
I hope all is forgiven  
You loved me, you hate me, I used to be your lover  
You know you had it coming, girl  
So take me to the other side  
Take me to the other side, take me to the other side  
Lovin' you has got to be

Didn't I raise my voice  
High enough for you  
I was running like a fugitive all the time  
Risking rejection from my own people yeah  
Now that you got what you wanted  
You don' t even know my name  
It' s so funny, we don' t talk anymore  
Be good to the people on your  
Way up the ladder  
Cause you' ll need them on your way down  
  
[Chorus:]  
That' s the way it is  
  
Didn't I raise fists high enough for you  
I guess I can' t pat myself on the shoulder  
For a job well done  
Dodging bullets in the streets  
I was there  
Risking rejection from my own people yeah  
Now that you got what you wanted  
You don' t even know my name  
remember  
Be good to the people on your way  
Up the ladder 'cause you' ll need  
Them on your way down  
  
[Chorus:]  
That' s the way it is

We take a lot of things for granted  
One day it' ll be taken away  
That' s when you' ll realize  
How important it was  
You never miss your water  
Till your well runs dry  
Give thanks and praise all the time  
The wolf is always by the door  
  
[Chorus:]  
You don' t know what you' ve got  
Till you lose it all again  
You never miss your water  
Till your well runs dry  
  
He' s a hero, now that he' s dead  
Oh what a bull preacher man talks about him  
When he was alive  
He didn't even know his name  
When he was alive  
He didn't get this love  
You never miss your water  
Till your well runs dry  
  
[Chorus:]  
You don' t know what you' ve got  
Till you lose it again  
You never lose your water  
Till your well runs dry

Have you ever seen a dream walking?  
Have you ever heard a dream talking?  
You are the master of your dreams  
If you pull the right strings  
It could be talking to you  
If you pull the right strings  
It could be walking to you.  
  
You are the one to make it happen  
You're the only one that knows what is  
You are holding the key to your dreams  
Don't hestitate grab the chance  
Before it's too late.  
  
Chorus  
Reach out and touch your dreams.  
  
Don't let them tell you it is impossible  
That is what they told all heroes before  
In a hero's mind the word does not exist  
When you're 80 years old  
Thinking about your past  
Regretting every minute of your life  
That you've lost  
You will wonder where the time went  
If you do the right thing  
It could be talking to you  
Don't hesitate, grab the chance  
Before it's too late.  
  
Chorus  
Reach out and touch your drea.

I'm sleeping with my one eye open  
Cause I think you gonna come for me  
You're sleeping with your gun in hand  
Cause you think I'm gonna make  
Me move  
  
I've been chasing white people all my life  
You've been chasing black people all  
Your life  
Now that we know where we went  
Wrong, it's time some truth came out here  
  
You going to educate me  
About white people  
I will educate you about Black people and we'll unite  
That's why they call me trinity  
And my game is unity  
  
[Chorus]  
Trinity, unity  
  
My brothers have been chasing racists all the time  
Your brothers have been chasing freedom fighters all the time  
But at the end of the day  
We didn't know much about each other yeah  
  
When you saw a black man  
You saw a criminal,  
When I saw a white man  
I saw an oppressor  
But now that we know where we went wrong  
Let's unite  
  
You will educate me about white people  
I will educated you about black people  
  
That is why they call my trinity  
Cause my game is unity  
  
[Chorus: Repeats]

I have know this preacherman  
For a long time, he was a good man  
I have known this judge  
For a long time, he was a good man  
I have known this teacher  
For a long time, he was a good man too  
But because of the drugs  
They've been taking secretly  
Them are in loony houses today  
  
We cannot stand aside and look  
While the nation is going down the drain  
While the nation is going down the drain  
  
Up with hope, down with dope  
Up with hope, down with dope  
Up with hope, down with dope

For a while  
  
I cannot stand aside  
And look while the nation  
And look while the nation  
Is going down the drain  
Oh yo yo yo  
  
Up with hope, down with dope

Every where in the world  
People are fighting for freedom  
Nobody knows what is right  
Nobody knows what is wrong  
The black man say it's the white man  
The white man say it's the black man  
Indians say it's the colors  
Colors say it's everyone  
  
Your mother didn't tell you the truth  
Cause my father didn't tell me the truth  
Nobody knows what is wrong  
And what is right  
How long is this gonna last  
Cause we've come so far so fast  
  
When it started, you and I were not there so  
Why don't we  
Bury down apartheid  
Fight down war and crime  
Racial discrimination  
Tribal discrimination  
  
You and I were not there when it started  
We don' t know where it's coming from  
And where it's going  
So why don't we  
  
I'm not saying this  
Because I'm a coward  
But I'm thinking of the lives  
That we lose every time we fight  
Killing innocent people  
Women and children yeah  
Who doesn't know about the good  
Who doesn't know about the wars  
Your mother didn't tell you the truth  
Cause my father did not tell me the truth  
Yeah  
  
Black man say it' s the white man  
White man say it' s the black man  
Indians say it' s the coloreds  
Coloreds say it' s everyone  
  
When it started we were not there  
We know where we come from  
But we don' t know where we' re going  
So why don' t we  
  
Bury down apartheid  
Fight down war and crime  
Racial discrimination  
Tribal discrimination

We love it  
We need it, oh Lord  
When the world gets hooked on drugs  
You and I are hooked on music  
  
We smoke it  
We walk it  
And we eat it  
  
Make it your way of life  
Even the Pope agrees  
It is your natural way  
Of staying high  
  
You see, when you smoke music  
You don't have to smoke and hide  
Even when policeman comes  
You don't have to jump no fence  
  
We love it  
We smoke it  
Never stop the music  
  
Come on and make it your way of life  
Even the President agrees  
  
It is your natural connection  
To staying high  
  
We love it  
We smoke it  
We need it  
Never stop the music

I still believe in a little bit of magic  
Even though the world has gone crazy  
So good to know we still have a friend  
You came to me last night and whispered in my ear  
Told me not to worry about anything, yeah  
You said you are still my friend  
And the feeling is mutual  
Right here
