I can't sleep tonight  
I won't sleep tomorrow  
I'm goin' deep and tight  
I don't need no excuse  
I feel mean tonight  
One-eyed jacks and aces  
Read 'em and weep tonight  
I'm gonna let all hell break loose  
  
I want drums like thunder  
Gimme guitars that scream  
One woman who could shake me  
Yeah, be my love machine  
  
I need a love machine  
to keep my motor running  
Upon the big wide screen  
I want to see it all  
Yeah, we'll be lean and mean  
We'll be synchronized together  
Me and my love machine  
We're gonna do it all  
  
I want drums like thunder  
Gimme guitars that scream  
One woman who can rock me  
Yeah, my little love machine  
  
We're gonna make tonight  
A night to remember  
We're going hard and strong  
Again and again  
Yeah, we're gonna make tonight  
A night to remember  
Yeah we're gonna take tonight  
Right to the end  
  
I need drums like thunder  
Gimme guitars that scream  
One woman who can rock me  
I need a love machine  
  
We gotta make tonight  
A night to remember  
We're goin' hard and strong  
Again and again  
  
Yeah, we're gonna make tonight  
A night to remember  
Yeah we're goin' for a night  
A night without end  
  
We gotta make tonight  
A night to remember  
We're goin' hard and strong  
Again and again  
  
We're gonna make tonight  
A night to remember  
Yeah we're gonna take tonight  
Right to the end

So I walk another mile down this crooked road  
Clouds rolling in Lord it's getting cold  
Feeling fine  
Feel lost feeling blue tonight  
But my only friend is Mr. Moonlight  
Then I see you girl lost in your book of poems  
You're in another world  
I should leave you alone  
My heart races on I try and hold it back  
  
But like a runaway train I'm about to jump the tracks  
Now you say you need a friend  
I swear to you if that's what you need  
That's what I'll be  
But I hope this never ends  
I feel there's something more the way  
You look at me  
  
And that's all I need to know  
I won't question why, don't need a reason  
We can take our time we can take it real slow  
When I see it in your eyes  
That's all I need to know  
  
Now we're talking 'bout angels that have lost their wings  
This melancholy world and the nature of things  
But then there's only silence when your eyes meet mine  
  
Reciting from your black book you were like some wounded bird  
I tried to catch your heart as it fell between your words  
You tore out one page and let it blow away  
Then you disappeared into your world  
It's a place I just can't stay  
  
You say you need a friend  
I swear to you if that's what you need  
That's what I'll be  
But I hope this never ends  
I feel there's something more the way  
You look at me  
  
And that's all I need to know  
I won't question why, don't need a reason  
We can take our time we can take it real slow  
When I see it in your eyes  
That's all I need to know  
  
All I need to know  
I won't question why, don't need a reason  
We can take our time we can take it real slow  
When I see it in your eyes  
That's all I need to know

Never had no need  
For any military aid  
And I never took charge of the light brigade  
I got no castle to defend or attack  
But still I seem to be picking up flack  
I am the captain of this body of mine  
I'll send fear into the enemy lines  
On the ground, in the air or at sea  
They're all pointing a finger at me  
I'm at war with the world  
That's the way it must be  
I'll fight while I can  
To put an end to this misery  
I'm at war with the world  
I'll have to fight to be free  
Yes I'm at war with the world  
Nobody's capturing me  
Never have no need  
For any military aid  
Never took charge of the light brigade  
I got no castle to defend or attack  
But still I seem to be picking up flack  
War with the world, with the world  
I'll have to fight to be be free  
Yes I'm at war with the world, with the world  
Nobody's capturing me  
War with the world  
What do they want from me?  
War with the world  
Why don't they let me be?  

I felt so sure of the love that we shared  
There was no reason for love to be scared  
Then I heard a rumor that started to flow  
Slowly but surely, the truth began to show  
  
And I started wondering  
As I picked up the phone  
And a man started asking  
If you where at home  
  
[Chorus]  
You treat me like a fool  
But you're so wrong  
I'm gonna send you back  
Where you belong  
  
I put my trust in you  
But I was wrong  
I'm gonna send you back  
Where you belong  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I never had any doubt in my mind  
Now you have showed me  
That love can make you blind  
  
Back where you belong  
Back where you belong  
Back where you belong  
Back where you belong  
Back where you belong  
Back where you belong  
Back where you belong  
Back where you belong  
Back where you belong  
Back where you belong  
Back where you belong  
Back where you belong

Big dog, scratching at the door  
With this big dog, you won't want to round, no more  
My big dog, guiri, bites, hah-huh-grrrrrr  
  
Big dog, growling, grrrrrr  
Bad dog, babe, you better keep away  
Guiri, guiri, guiri, hah-huh-grrrrrr  
  
This big dog bites, hah  
  
Grrrrrrrrr, grrrrrrrrr  
  
Big dog  
  
Big, big dog  
  
Grrrrrrrrr  
  
Big dog, grrrrrr  
  
My big, big dog  
  
Big dog, bites, grrrrrrrrr, grrr  
  
Big dog, hah-huh  
  
Grrrrrrrrr, grrrrrrrrr  
  
Grrrrrrrrr  
  
Big dog, hah-huh  
  
Big, big dog  
  
You better get adviced  
You better let this big dog

Blinded by science, I'm on the run  
Blinded by science, where do I belong?  
What's in the future, has it just begun  
Blinded by science, I'm on the run  
  
I worry 'bout the world that we live in  
I'm worried by all the confusion  
I wonder 'bout the lies I've been reading  
I wonder where this madness is leading  
  
Is this a road going nowhere?  
Or is someone leading us somewhere?  
I can't believe we're here for no reason  
There must be something we can believe in  
  
Blinded by science, I'm on the run  
I'm not an appliance, so don't turn me on  
What's in the future, has it just begun  
Blinded by science, I'm on the run  
  
What's in the future, has it just begun  
Blinded by science, I'm on the run  
  
I worry 'bout the world that we live in  
I'm worried by all the confusion  
I wonder 'bout the lies I've been reading  
I wonder where this madness is leading  
  
Is this a road going nowhere?  
Is someone leading us somewhere?  
I can't believe we're here for no reason  
There must be something we can believe in  
  
Blinded by science, I'm on the run  
I'm not an appliance, don't turn me on  
What's in the future, has it just begun  
Blinded by science, I'm on the run  
  
Blinded by science, I'm on the run  
I'm blinded by science, on the run

Out in the street at six AM, another sleepless night  
Three cups of coffee, but I can't clear my head from what went down last night  
Know we both have our own little ways, but somehow we keep it together  
You hear me talk, but you don't hear what I say, I guess it don't even matter  
  
[Chorus]  
Blue morning, blue day, won't you see things my way  
Blue morning, can't you see, what your love has done to me  
  
I've always listened to your point of view, my ways I've tried to mend  
And I've always been a patient man, but my patience has reached its end  
You tell me you're leaving, you tell me goodbye  
You say you might send a letter  
Well honey don't telephone, cause I won't be alone  
I need someone to make me feel better  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Chorus]  
(Blue morning) blue morning, (blue morning) blue morning  
(Blue morning) blue morning, blue blue blue day, yeah

I've been on this road a long time  
I've been travellin' for days  
But it seems I'm getting nowhere  
I just can't find my way  
I've been following directions  
But they must be out of date  
And I can't, and I can't, and I can't, no I can't  
Decide which road to take  
  
See I've got to find my baby  
Cause we need to work things out  
I've got to see that woman  
I cannot do without her!  
  
You know I can't wait, can't wait another moment  
I can't wait, I can't wait another heartbeat  
No I can't wait, can't wait another moment  
I couldn't wait another heartbeat  
I can't wait until midnight  
  
And the nights go on forever  
These days I get no sleep  
And I miss her more than ever  
Inside where love runs deep  
Oh I know I'm going to find her  
Cause I'm following this star  
And I can't, and I can't, no I can't turn back  
Oh lord, I've come so far  
  
And I'll know she'll whisper in my ear  
'Bout all the things I've missed  
She's got that way about her now  
I never could resist  
  
And now I can't wait, can't wait another moment  
No I can't wait, I can't wait another heartbeat  
I can't wait, can't wait another moment  
I couldn't wait another heartbeat  
I can't wait until midnight  
  
No I can't wait  
I can't wait another moment  
I couldn't wait another heartbeat  
I can't wait until the midnight  
  
Now I can't wait  
No no no can't wait  
No no no  
Can't wait  
No no no  
Can't wait  
[repeat and fade out]

You're as cold as ice  
You're willing to sacrifice our love  
You never take advice  
Someday you'll pay the price, I know  
  
I've seen it before  
It happens all the time  
Closing the door  
You leave the world behind  
  
You're digging for gold  
Yet throwing away  
A fortune in feelings  
But someday you'll pay  
  
You're as cold as ice  
You're willing to sacrifice our love  
You want paradise  
But someday you'll pay the price, I know  
  
I've seen it before  
It happens all the time  
Closing the door  
You leave the world behind  
  
You're digging for gold  
Yet throwing away  
A fortune in feelings  
But someday you'll pay  
  
(Cold, as, ice)  
You know that you are  
(Cold, cold) (as, as) (ice)  
As cold as ice to me  
(Cold, cold, cold) (as, as, as) (ice)  
  
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, you're as cold as ice)  
(You're as cold as icccce)  
You're as cold as ice  
(Cold as icccce)  
Cold as ice I know  
(You're as cold as icccce)  
You're as cold as ice  
(Cold as icccce)  
Cold as ice I know  
(You're as cold as icccce)  
Oh, yes I know  
(Cold as icccce)  
(You're as cold as icccce)  
You're as cold as ice  
(Cold as icccce)  
Cold as ice I know  
(You're as cold as icccce)  
Oh, yes I know  
(Cold as icccce)

Gonna break these chains  
Gonna set myself free  
Gonna turn on the mains  
Feel the power inside of me  
Gonna burn all night--gonna burn all day  
You'll see me coming  
From miles away  
  
Feel me in the air  
Feel me all around you  
Gonna show you how I care  
Teach you something new  
I'm gonna take my time  
Make love to you  
Yeah I know I can satisfy you  
That's what I intend to do  
  
Now I'm counting every minute  
Every single minute  
I'm calling for you, honey  
Come and get it while it's hot  
Counting every minute  
Ooh I'm living it  
I'll make every minute count  
Give it everything I've got  
  
Feel me getting closer  
I'm almost there  
Can you fell my fingers  
Running through your hair  
Can you feel my hands  
Draw you closer to me  
Can you hear that clock tick, tick, ticking baby  
I'll soon be there to set you free  
  
I'm counting every minute  
Every single minute  
Don't fool around come and  
Get it while it's hot  
Counting every minute  
Ooh I'm living in it  
I'll make every minute count  
Give it everything I've got  
  
Counting every minute  
Every single minute  
I'm calling for you, honey  
Come and get it while it's hot  
  
Counting every minute  
Ooh I'm gonna give it  
I'll give it to you honey  
I'll give you everything  
I've got  
  
Yeah I'm counting every minute  
Every single minute  
Don't fool around come and  
Get it while it's hot  
  
Counting every minute  
Baby don't be timid  
I'll make every minute count  
Give it everything I've got  
  
Counting every minute  
Counting every minute  
Counting every minute  
  
I'm calling for you honey  
Come and get it while  
It's hot  
  
I'm counting  
Every single minute  
I'm waiting for you baby  
Give you everything I've got

Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight  
It must have been something you said  
I just died in your arms tonight  
  
I keep looking for something I can't get  
Broken hearts lie all around me  
And I don't see an easy way to get out of this  
  
Her diary, it sits by the bedside table  
The curtains are closed, the cat's in the cradle  
Who would've thought that a boy like me could come to this  
  
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight  
It must've been something you said  
I just died in your arms tonight  
  
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight  
It must've been some kind of kiss  
I should've walked away  
  
Is there any just cause for feeling like this?  
On the surface I'm a name on a list  
I try to be discreet, but then blow it again  
  
I've lost and found, it's my final mistake  
She's loving by proxy, no give and all take  
'Cause I've been thrilled to fantasy one too many times  
  
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight  
It must've been something you said  
I just died in your arms tonight  
  
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight  
It must've been some kind of kiss  
I should've walked away  
  
It was a long hot night  
She made it easy, she made it feel right  
But now it's over, the moment has gone  
I followed my hands not my head, I know I was wrong  
  
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight  
It must've been something you said  
I just died in your arms tonight  
  
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight  
It must've been some kind of kiss  
I should've walked away

Hey baby, if you're feeling down, I know what's good for you all day  
Are you worried what your friends see  
And will it ruin your reputation loving me?  
'Cause I'm a dirty white boy, yeah a dirty white boy, a dirty white boy  
Don't drive no big black car, don't like no Hollywood movie stars  
You want me to be true to you, you don't give a damn what I do to you  
I'm just a dirty white boy, dirty white boy, dirty white boy, dirty white boy  
  
Well I'm a dirty white boy, dirty white boy, yeah, dirty white boy  
A dirty white boy  
I've been in trouble since I don't know when  
I'm in trouble now and I know somehow I'll find trouble again  
I'm a loner but I'm never alone  
Every night I get one step closer to the danger zone  
Cause I'm a dirty white boy, yeah, dirty white boy  
I'm a dirty white boy, dirty white boy  
Come on come on boy, white boy, I'm a dirty white boy, a dirty white boy  
Hey I'm a dirty white boy, yeah I'm a dirty white boy, dirty white boy, yeah!

Don't tell me what you can't do  
Never had a hold on you  
And don't tell me where you'd rather be  
Just say the word, I'll set you free  
  
You won't believe what you won't see  
The only one you'll lose is me  
Don't tell me what you can't do, oh no  
  
Give a little, I need a lot  
You never think about what we've got  
Maybe our breakup is long overdue  
If it's over me, it's up to you  
  
Don't make it harder than you need to  
You're old enough to hear the truth  
Don't tell me what you can't do  
  
I'd do anything to make you stay  
I'd be a fool to let you get away  
They say true love never runs smooth  
But when it's gone, what can you do?  
  
You won't believe what you won't see  
The only one you'll lose is me  
Do what you like, you know that you can, mmm  
  
Don't let her go!  
Maybe I should let her know  
I'll try to be strong  
But it's wrong!  
I'm gonna have to let her go  
If you walk out on me  
I'd be lonely as a man could be  
  
You won't believe what you won't see  
The only one you'll lose is me  
Do what you like, you know that you can  
But girl, if you're wrong, please understand  
Do what you like, you know that you can  
But girl, if you're wrong, please understand  
  
Do what you like, you know that you can  
Don't tell me what you can't do  
But girl, if you're wrong, please understand  
Never had a hold on you  
Tell me you like, you know that you can  
And don't tell me where you'd rather be  
But girl, if you're wrong, please understand  
Just say the word, I'll set you free  
  
You won't believe what you won't see  
The only one you'll lose is me  
Girl, you're losing me  
You're losing me  
Just do what you like  
Do what you like, girl  
  
Walk out of me, walk out of me  
Girl you walk out of me  
Say the word, I'll set you free  
  
You won't believe what you won't see  
The only one you'll lose is me

Another long day, another long night  
I try to make it home before it gets light  
I'm working hard so some day we can play  
When I try to explain you just push me away  
Don't push me away, you say  
I don't spend enough time with you  
Or take an interest in things you do  
We call it quits almost every other day  
And the rare times we're going strong  
We let our pride get in the way  
Seems like it's always in the way  
But don't let go, don't let our love go  
Don't let go, just let our love grow  
Sometimes we might drift away, don't let our love go  
But don't let go of our love when it feels right  
This kinda life can put us both to the test  
But it's not a question of who knows best  
Our love's a ship that has it's sails a little torn  
All we need to do is sew 'em up  
And we can weather the storm  
Gonna ride that storm  
So don't let go, don't let our love go  
Don't let go, just let our love grow  
Sometimes we might drift away, don't let our love go  
But don't let go  
No, no, don't let go, don't let our love go  
Don't let go, just let our love grow  
Sometimes we might drift away, don't let our love go  
Don't let go of our love when it feels right  
I don't see you for days  
When you leave me in the dark  
My imagination runs away  
Just throw me a line  
And I'll still hold on  
I'll still hold on  
I'll still hold on  
And I won't let go  
Don't let go, don't let our love go  
Baby don't let go, just let our love grow  
Oh, no, don't let our love fade away  
And don't let go of our love when it feels right, oh no  
Don't let our love go  
Don't let go  
Just let our love grow  
Sometimes we might slip away  
Don't let our love go  
But don't let go of our love when it feels right  

Feeling down n' dirty, feeling kinda mean  
I've been from one to another extreme  
This time I had a good time, ain't got time to wait  
I want to stick around till I can't see straight  
  
Fill my eyes with that double vision, no disguise for that double vision  
Ooh, when it gets through to me, it's always new to me  
My double vision gets the best of me  
  
Never do more than I really need  
My mind is racing, but my body's in the lead  
Tonight's the night, I'm gonna push it to the limit  
I live all of my years in a single minute  
  
Fill my eyes with that double vision, no disguise for that double vision  
Ooh, when it gets through to me, it's always new to me  
My double vision always seems to get the best of me, the best of me, yeah  
  
Ooh, double vision, I need my double vision  
It takes me out of my head, takin' me out of my head  
I get my double vision, oh, seeing double double  
Oh, I have double vision, yeah, I'm getting double vision

Goodbye is a dangerous game to play  
It breaks your heart and tears your life away  
You say it's over and that's the end  
With no last kiss, and no kind words like friends  
  
But I'm gonna wait my time  
I will stand in line  
And it will work out fine  
And our love will grow  
Because I know  
Baby yes I know  
  
Everything that comes around, goes around  
And everything that goes around, comes around someday  
Everything that comes around, goes around  
And everything that goes around, comes around someday  
  
D'you think about me now and then?  
And wonder were you wrong and what might have been?  
And seasons come and seasons go  
And what goes up comes down, and baby soon you'll know  
  
I'm gonna wait my time  
I will stand in line  
And it will turn out fine  
And our love will grow  
Because I know  
Baby yes I know  
  
Everything that comes around, goes around  
Everything that goes around, comes around someday  
Everything that comes around, goes around  
Everything that goes around, comes around someday  
  
So you can go and leave me now  
You see it don't make any difference  
Go on and leave me now  
'Cause you'll be back sometime in my life  
There may be some other ones  
And you might think some better ones  
  
But if I wait my time  
If I stand in line  
It will turn out fine  
And our love will grow  
Because I know  
Baby yes I know  
  
Everything that comes around, goes around  
And everything that goes around, comes around someday  
Everything that comes around, goes around  
Everything that goes around, comes around someday  
  
Everything that comes around, (everything) goes around (I'm gonna be here  
Babe)  
Everything that goes around, comes around someday  
Everything that comes around, goes around  
Everything that goes around, comes around someday  
  
So let it turn around  
  
Everything that comes around, goes around  
Everything that goes around, (everything) comes around (someday) someday  
Everything that comes around, goes around, oh-oh-aaah  
Everything that goes around, comes around someday, yeah

We never talk to one another  
We just disagree  
I'm the one who runs for cover  
And you turn your back on me  
  
They say nothing's gonna last forever  
But some things are worth fighting for  
Yeah, well love could bring us back together  
But love don't come round here no more  
  
The words unspoken in the night  
Locked away in my heart  
And I'm feeling out of place  
But if love is the key  
Let it open the door  
So we'll be standing -- face to face  
  
You never want to see me face to face  
Think it over  
Face to face  
If only it could be just face to face  
  
Baby you and me  
Face to face  
  
I may be better off without it  
I can't go on this way  
Time has come to talk about it  
This is our judgement day  
  
You know we swore it would last forever  
Always felt so sure it would  
But it's looking like now or never  
Time to turn a bad thing into good  
  
The words that echo in the night  
They're fading away  
And they're gone without a trace  
Now it's up to you and me  
Let's open the door  
And meet each other -- face to face  
  
It's time we saw each other face to face  
To talk it over  
Face to face  
You know it's gotta be just face to face  
Baby you and me  
Face to face  
  
We gotta see each other -- face to face  
And talk about it  
Face to face  
Hope it ain't too late to meet face to face  
Just you and me  
[solo]  
  
Face to Face  
It's time we saw each other face to face  
To talk it over  
Face to face  
You know it's gotta be just face to face  
Baby you and me  
  
Face to face  
We gotta see each other  
face to face  
And talk about it  
Face to face  
I hope it ain't too late to meet  
Face to face  
Don't turn your back on me  
Face to face  
It's time we saw each other  
Face to face  
To talk it over

It's four o' clock in the mornin'  
And the daylight's creepin' in  
And I'm lyin' awake in bed  
And outside my window  
The rain's just pourin' down  
And there's a pain inside my head, oh yeah  
I looked hard into the mirror  
Took some water in my hands  
And threw it on my face  
But your memory won't fade away  
I see you everywhere  
Around this empty space  
This night's too long, fadin' fast  
I tell myself, this pain won't last  
It's just a flesh wound  
Missin' my heart but it still cuts deep  
Nothin' but a flesh wound, yeah  
It tore me apart and I still can't sleep  
You know you really did it well  
Now I'm lyin' on a bed of nails  
But it's nothin' but a flesh wound  
Better pull myself together  
Gotta hold my head up high  
That's what I've got to do  
No damage done  
But deep inside my heart  
Who am I tryin' to fool  
It's over now, it's all in the past  
I tell myself, this pain won't last  
It's just a flesh wound  
Missin, my heart but it still cuts deep  
Nothin' but a flesh wound, oh  
It tore me apart and I still can't sleep, no, no  
I've got no choice, I must be strong  
Can't lie here thinkin' about it all night long  
It's nothin' but a flesh wound  
It's just a flesh wound  
Missin' my heart but it still cuts deep  
Nothin' but a flesh wound, oh  
And it tore me apart but I still can't sleep  
You know you really did it well  
Now I'm lyin' on a bed of nails  
It's just a flesh wound, oh  
I got to be strong  
It's just a flesh wound, babe  
It tore me apart oh, at last  
It's a flesh wound  
Nothing but a flesh wound, oh  
It cuts me deep, yeah  

Well I miss you, Honey  
A little more everyday  
And I know if I kissed you  
You'd be comin' back home to stay  
  
'Cause I know I was wrong  
But how long do I have to pay  
You know you belong here beside me  
I'm a fool for you anyway  
I'm a fool for you anyway  
I'm a fool for you anyway  
  
Well I cried for you so long  
The river of tears ran dry  
And I tried to be so strong  
But grew weaker as time went by  
  
You know your love left a mark on me  
I don't think it will fade away  
I sit here and wait 'til you come home  
'Cause I'm a fool for you anyway  
I'm a fool for you anyway  
Fool for you anyway  
  
You know your love left a mark on me  
I don't think it will fade away  
I sit here and wait 'til you come home  
'Cause I'm a fool for you anyway  
Yes I'm a fool for you anyway  
I'm a fool for you anyway  
  
Fool for you anyway  
Fool for you anyway  
Yes I'm a fool for you anyway  
A fool for you anyway  
A fool for you anyway  
I'm a fool for you anyway

It's night, again  
Time for my mind to go wandering  
Off on a journey, through space and time  
In search of a face I can never find  
So I close my eyes and look inside  
  
I can't forget  
The night that I saw her we never met  
She felt so close to me as I reached for her hand  
She drifted away like the desert sand  
It was her and she was gone  
  
I wish she'd come back tonight  
Like a star shining bright  
I don't know where she's from  
  
She's like a girl on the moon  
A girl on the moon  
She's like a girl on the moon  
A girl on the moon  
  
Yeah it's night, once again  
And that same old feeling is setting in  
It all seems so familiar but I hope this time  
That the girl on the moon will soon be mine  
All mine, tonight  
  
Am I asking too much  
Should I leave my dream untouched  
Should I even know where she's from  
  
My, girl on the moon  
She's my girl on the moon  
Girl on the moon  
My girl on the moon  
Girl on the moon  
My girl on the moon  
Girl on the moon  
Girl on the moon  
Girl on the moon  
Fille sur la lune  
Girl on the moon  
Fille sur la lune

Rescue me  
I can't dream this dream any more, my dream oh my dream  
Set me free  
I keep holdin' on but  
I don't know what for  
  
All I know  
Is that I've breathed your name for what feels like a lifetime  
I can't let go, you're a part of me  
  
And I die each time  
I lose a little more of you  
And I look for a sign, to give me hope  
We'll find a love we once knew  
  
And all I know  
Is when we're face to face when there's no one between us  
With one last embrace, we'll let time heal the pain  
  
Keep your hand on my heart don't let go  
I can't see you're too close to me  
Don't leave me in the dark, keep your hand on my heart  
Oh please, only you, lonely me  
  
It's not enough, to simply talk about love  
As if it were in our control  
Now as I struggle with the past, I can't think about the future  
It's so hard to let go  
  
And all I know  
Is I still whisper your name, girl it won't be the last time  
As our lives go separate ways  
And let time heal the pain  
  
Keep your hand on my heart don't let go  
I can't see you're too close to me  
Don't leave me in dark, keep your hand on my heart  
Oh please, only you, lonely me  
  
Keep your hand on my heart don't let go  
I can't see you're too close to me  
Don't leave me in dark, keep your hand on my heart  
Oh please  
  
Keep your hand on my heart don't let go  
I can't see you're too close to me  
Don't leave me in dark, keep your hand on my heart  
Oh please, only you, lonely me  
Only you, lonely me

Day light, alright, I don't know, I don't know if it's real  
Been a long night, and something ain't right  
You won't show, you won't show how you feel  
No time ever seems right, to talk about the reasons why you and I fight  
It's high time to draw the line, put an end to this game, before it's too late  
Head games, it's you and me, baby  
Head games, and I can't take it anymore  
Head games, I don't want to play the head games  
A daydream, for hours it seems, I keep thinking of you, yeah thinking of you  
These daydreams, what do they mean? They keep haunting me, are they warning me  
Daylight turns into night  
We try and find the answer, but it's nowhere in sight  
It's always the same, and you know who's to blame  
You know what I'm saying, still we keep on playing  
Head games, that's all I get from you  
Head games, and I can't take it anymore  
Head games, don't want to play the head games  
  
So near, yet so far away, we pass each other by cause we don't know what to
say  
It's so clear, I'm sorry to say  
But if you want to win, you gotta learn how to play  
Head games, always you and me, baby  
Head games, till I can't take it anymore  
Head games, instead of making love  
Head games, oh  
Head games, always you and me, baby  
Head games, till I can't take it anymore, no more  
Head games, instead of making love, we play  
Head games  
Head games, in the first degree  
Head games, yeah, always you and me  
Head games, why do you do it, baby  
Head games

The days and nights you sit around wondering where can she be  
Hoping that she might appear, out of nowhere  
But you fail to see  
All the hurt inside, the wounded pride  
Ooh what she went through for you  
You cheated and lied, as her love slowly died  
And her heart just broke in two  
When she was with you, all along  
Behind you right or wrong  
She tried to hold on, hold on  
But you went too far, and she's gone  
And now it's over and her heart turns to stone  
No time for pity, when her heart turns to stone  
She cries a little as her heart turns to stone  
She's that kind of woman  
She'll do fine on her own  
What you thought was a game  
A game you were winning  
Wouldn't go your way  
Now you've lost what you had  
And your back to the beginning  
It's the price you have to pay  
When she was with you, all along  
Behind you right or wrong  
She tried to hold on, hold on  
But you went too far, and she's gone  
And now it's over and her heart turns to stone  
No time for pity, when her heart turns to stone  
She cries a little as her heart turns to stone  
She's that kind of woman  
She'll get by on her own  
She hides the pain  
But her heart turns to stone  
No time for pity  
When her heart turns to stone  
She cries sometimes  
As her heart turns to stone  
She's that kind of woman  
She'll get by on her own  
Yeah it's over  
And her heart turns to stone  
Don't look for pity now  
When her heart turns to stone  
Listen to her cry  
Listen to her cry  
She's a woman now  
Ooh it's a sad thing to see  
To see a heart turn to stone  
The heart of a woman  
A heart turned to stone

I can feel these four walls around me  
I can feel them closing in on me  
But I know there's someone out there  
Ready and waiting  
For the chance to set me free  
  
I don't want nothing  
Ain't looking for no one  
You walk into my life  
Well I ain't no hopeless romantic  
I've gotta listen to my cautious heart  
I've been dealing with my illusions of love  
I built it up and then I tear it apart  
  
And I feel this rising suspicion  
That my heart will ever rule my mind  
Well I'm guilty of love  
By my own admission  
Come on girl let me do my time  
  
Hey, when I call you  
I need to fill the hole in my soul  
Hey, when I fall through  
I need to fill the hole in my soul  
  
Don't need no sisters of mercy  
They set me off like a loaded gun  
Ain't nothing in this world possessing me  
Honey you're the only one  
  
Can't live in this empty sadness  
It's more than we can endure  
Well wise men say  
That love is madness  
Come on girl I say that love is the cure  
  
Hey, when I call you  
I need to fill the hole in my soul  
Hey, when I fall through  
I need to fill the hole in my soul  
Hey, without you  
I will fall through the hole in my soul  
  
Hey, when I call you  
I need to fill the hole in my soul  
Hey, when I fall through  
I need to fill the hole in my soul  
Hey, without you  
I will fall through the hole in my soul  
  
Hey, I need you  
I need you to fill the hole in my soul  
Hey, I want you to fill the hole in my soul  
Hey, hey, hey, I need you to fill the hole in my soul

Well, I'm hot blooded, check it and see  
I got a fever of a hundred and three  
Come on baby, do you do more than dance?  
I'm hot blooded, I'm hot blooded  
  
You don't have to read my mind, to know what I have in mind  
Honey you oughta know  
Now you move so fine, let me lay it on the line  
I wanna know what you're doin' after the show  
  
Now it's up to you, we can make a secret rendezvous  
Just me and you, I'll show you lovin' like you never knew  
  
That's why, I'm hot blooded, check it and see  
I got a fever of a hundred and three  
Come on baby, do you do more than dance?  
I'm hot blooded, hot blooded  
  
If it feels alright, maybe you can stay all night  
Shall I leave you my key?  
But you've got to give me a sign, come on girl, some kind of sign  
Tell me, are you hot mama? you sure look that way to me  
  
Are you old enough? will you be ready when I call you bluff?  
Is my timing right? did you save your love for me tonight?  
  
Yeah I'm hot blooded, check it and see  
Feel the fever burning inside of me  
Come on baby, do you do more than dance?  
I'm hot blooded, I'm hot blooded, I'm hot  
  
Now it's up to you, can we make a secret rendezvous?  
Oh, before we do, you'll have to get away from you know who  
  
Well, I'm hot blooded, check it and see  
I got a fever of a hundred and three  
Come on baby, do you do more than dance?  
I'm hot blooded, I'm hot blooded  
  
Hot blooded, every night  
Hot blooded, you're looking so tight  
Hot blooded, now you're driving me wild  
Hot blooded, I'm so hot for you, child  
Hot blooded, I'm a little bit high  
Hot blooded, you're a little bit shy  
Hot blooded, you're making me sing  
Hot blooded, for your sweet sweet thing

I find myself in a strange situation  
And I don't know how  
What seemed to be an infatuation  
Is so different now  
I can't get by if we're not together  
Ooh can't you see  
Girl, I want you now and forever  
Close to me  
I'm longing for the time  
I'm longing for the day  
Hoping that you will promise to be mine  
And never go away  
  
I don't want to live without you  
I don't want to live without you  
I could never live without you  
Live without your love  
  
I ask myself but there's no explanation  
For the way I feel  
I know I've reached the right destination  
And I know it's real  
  
I'm longing for the time  
I'm longing for the day  
When I'll be giving you this heart of mine  
Believe me when I say  
  
I don't want to live without you  
I don't want to live without you  
I could never live without you  
Live without your love  
  
No I don't want to live without you  
I don't want to live without you  
I could never live without you  
Live without your love  
  
Now I don't want to live without you  
I don't want to live without you  
I could never be without you  
Be without your love  
  
I don't want to live without you  
Live without your love  
Live without your love  
You see I'm lost without your love  
  
Ooh, oh  
Without your love

I have waited oh, so long  
Please don't tell me baby I was wrong  
Dreaming of you every night  
Holding back until the time was right  
  
I've counted the days, day after day  
Since we've been apart  
Now I've found my way, I've found my way  
Right back to your heart  
  
I've been searching for you every where  
Calling you, but you were never there  
Seeking in the dark of night  
Hoping one day you would shine a light  
  
I've counted each day, day after day  
Since we've been apart  
Now I've found my way, I've found my way  
Right back to your heart  
  
I have waited oh, so long  
Please don't tell me baby I was wrong  
Dreaming of you every night, every night, every night  
Holding back until the time was right  
  
Ooh, I have waited so long  
Aah, don't tell me I was wrong  
  
I dream of you, I'm dreaming of you baby  
  
Don't go away

As I gather my thoughts  
With the pieces of my heart  
How long is forever  
I'm not afraid and I won't be torn apart  
We've had our time together  
I'll start again at any cost  
I've learned a lot from losing you  
But I've got nothing if I'm lost  
And I keep hoping  
And I still believe in love  
If I wait long enough  
I know I'll be strong enough  
I keep hoping  
I believe in faith and trust  
I'm gonna find a way  
There are better days still ahead of us  
I keep hoping  
  
Now this candle burns low  
It won't last through the night  
But I've found peace  
And I know it's all right  
I try to understand  
What's been missing in my life  
Between the darkness and the daylight  
  
No I'm not expecting miracles  
I've got my doubts like any other one  
I've learned a lot from losing you  
But I've got nothing if I'm lost  
  
And I keep hoping  
And I still believe in love  
If I wait long enough  
I know I'll be strong enough  
I keep hoping  
I believe in faith and trust  
I'm gonna find a way  
There are better days still ahead of us  
I keep hoping, I keep hoping  
I keep hoping and praying baby  
And I still believe in love

Selling your soul ain't the right way of givin'  
Oh with you I could change  
This misguided goal I've been livin'  
Anything, anything, you might need or desire  
Just call on me, 'cause my heart's on fire  
  
And I need you  
Do you need me too?  
Yes I need you, yes I need you  
  
Many is the time I've cursed the lord's creations  
Ah but you touched my hand  
I loved this new sensation  
It was very strange, what a change  
Of you I did not tire  
So call on me, my heart's on fire  
  
Well I need you  
Do you need me too? need me too?  
Yes I need you, ah  
  
Yes I need you  
Oh I need you  
And I need you  
Say you need me too  
Yes I need you  
Oh I need  
Say you need me too  
  
Yes I need you  
And I need you  
Oh I need  
Yes I need you  
Oh I need  
Say you need me too  
Say you need me too  
Say you need me too  
Say, say baby  
Say you need me too  
Yes I need you  
Oh I need you too  
And I need you

I gotta take a little time, a little time to think things over  
I better read between the lines, in case I need it when I'm older  
  
Now this mountain I must climb, feels like the world upon my shoulders  
Through the clouds I see love shine, it keeps me warm as life grows colder  
  
In my life there's been heartache and pain  
I don't know if I can face it again  
Can't stop now, I've traveled so far, to change this lonely life  
  
I want to know what love is, I want you to show me  
I want to feel what love is, I know you can show me  
  
I'm gonna take a little time, a little time to look around me  
I've got nowhere left to hide, it looks like love has finally found me  
  
In my life there's been heartache and pain  
I don't know if I can face it again  
Can't stop now, I've traveled so far, to change this lonely life  
  
I want to know what love is, I want you to show me  
I want to feel what love is, I know you can show me  
I want to know what love is, I want you to show me  
(And I want to feel) I want to feel what love is  
(And I know) I know you can show me  
  
Let's talk about love, I want to know what love is  
The love that you feel inside, I want you to show me  
And I'm feeling so much love, I want to feel what love is  
No, you just can't hide, I know you can show me  
I want to know what love is (let's talk about love), I know you can show me  
I want to feel it too, I want to feel what love is  
I want to feel it too, and I know and I know, I know you can show me  
Show me love is real, yeah, I want to know what love is

I'm turning to you, when love is on my mind  
You're all I want, woman, and love's so hard to find  
I know that I hurt you, and I know that I was wrong  
But I want you back, back where you belong  
  
And I won't give you up, no I won't walk away  
I hope and I pray, I hope and I pray  
You'll forgive me someday  
  
I'll fight for you, I'll give you all I got to give  
I'll fight for you, as long as we both should live  
I'll search for heaven each day  
And together, we'll find a way  
And I'll fight for you darlin'  
I'll fight for you baby, cause I've waited too long for love  
  
You're all of my life, and every time I look at you  
I keep tellin' myself, you're the one thing I just can't lose  
Our love runs so deeply, can't you feel it in your heart  
'Cause girl we've got something, that no one can tear apart  
  
I'm tellin' you now, this love, it just can't be wrong  
Oh, it can't be wrong  
And I won't give you up 'cause I've waited too long  
Oh, I've waited too long for love  
  
I'll fight for you, I'll give you all I got to give  
I'll fight for you, as long as we should live  
I'll search for heaven each day  
And together, we'll find a way  
And I'll fight for you darlin'  
I'll fight for you

You gave it to me real low  
You gave me such a low blow  
You caught me with my guard down  
You floored me in the first round  
You gave it to me real low  
You gave me such a low blow  
You hit me on the blind side  
You took me for a big ride  
But I won't let it get to me  
I couldn't go through all that  
No, I won't let it get to me  
I'll try and hold it all back  
And get even with you  
I'll get even with you  
Yeah, I'll get even with you  
You'll get what's comin' to you  
You gave it to me real low  
You give me such a low blow  
You kick a man when he's down  
You kick him when he's on the ground, yeah, yeah  
You gave it to me real low  
You give me such a low blow  
You got me in a tailspin  
You really tried to do me in  
But I won't let it get to me  
I couldn't go through all that  
No, I won't let it get to me  
I'll try and hold it all back  
But I'll get even with you  
I'll get even with you  
Hey, I'll get even with you  
You'll get what's comin' to you  
I'll get even with you, I'll get even with you, wait 'n' see  
I'll get even with you, I'll get even with you  
I'll get even with you, I'll get even with you  
I'll get even with you, I'll get even with you  
You'll get what's comin' to you  

Another dark night, in the city  
And my prospects lookin' thin  
The survival, of the fittest  
Is the law, in the world that I live in  
  
I was not born, to be a fighter  
But now's the time I have to learn  
To keep my head, above the water  
Gotta play with fire, but not get burned  
  
I gotta stand up, I gotta face it  
Don't want to lose it  
I want to taste it while it's hot  
Don't want to waste it, I need it so bad  
  
I'm gonna win, yeah  
I'm gonna win  
You see it's a matter of pride  
Deep down inside  
I'm gonna win, yeah  
I'm gonna win  
  
I got no time, to sit and wonder  
I got myself, to reckon with  
Yeah and life won't drag me under  
Even if it takes, all I have to give  
I'll give it all  
  
I gotta stand up, I gotta face it  
Don't want to lose it  
Ooh I want to taste it while it's hot  
Don't want to waste it, my mind's made up  
  
I'm gonna win  
I'm gonna win  
I tell you, see when it comes down to the crunch  
I've gotta beat life to the punch  
I'm gonna win  
Somehow I know I'm gonna win  
You know  
I've got to fight to stay alive

Gonna win, gonna win

Gonna win  
Hey, just watch me roll the dice

One man to the left  
One man to the right  
One man in the middle  
One man dressed in white  
  
One man in the east  
One man from the west  
One man in the middle  
One man under house arrest  
(Step back)  
  
Get hooked on the power  
Gotta stay in the game

Information at a very high price  
She gives you inside, information  
That can change your whole life overnight,  
In a minute  
  
One man to the left  
One man to the right  
One man in the middle  
Caught in the broad daylight  
  
Just a man on the street  
Another face in the crowd  
One man on the beat  
Wants everything that he's not allowed  
  
And the lady waits, so patiently  
She waits for the call  
She knows just what you need  
  
You need inside, information  
She can get it at a very high price  
A little, inside, information  
It can change your whole life overnight  
  
With a little inside, information

But get ready 'cause the hammer will fall  
It's gonna fall  
  
Inside, information  
Inside, information  
  
Is she telling you straight  
Is she telling you straight  
Is she telling you straight

Standing in the rain, with his head hung low  
Couldn't get a ticket, it was a sold out show  
Heard the roar of the crowd, he could picture the scene  
Put his ear to the wall, then like a distant scream  
He heard one guitar, just blew him away  
He saw stars in his eyes, and the very next day  
  
Bought a beat up six string, in a secondhand store  
Didn't know how to play it, but he knew for sure  
That one guitar, felt good in his hands, didn't take long, to understand  
Just one guitar, slung way down low  
Was a one way ticket, only one way to go  
So he started rockin', ain't never gonna stop  
Gotta keep on rockin', someday gonna make it to the top  
  
And be a juke box hero, got stars in his eyes, he's a juke box hero  
He took one guitar, juke box hero, stars in his eyes  
Juke box hero, (stars in his eyes) he'll come alive tonight  
  
In a town without a name, in a heavy downpour  
Thought he passed his own shadow, by the backstage door  
Like a trip through the past, to that day in the rain  
And that one guitar, made his whole life change  
Now he needs to keep on rockin', he just can't stop  
Gotta keep on rockin', that boy has got to stay on top  
  
And be a juke box hero, got stars in his eyes  
He's a juke box hero, got stars in his eyes  
Yeah, juke box hero, stars in his eyes  
With that one guitar, (stars in his eyes)  
He'll come alive, come alive tonight, woah  
  
Yeah, he's gotta keep on rockin', just can't stop  
Gotta keep on rockin', that boy has got to stay on top  
  
And be a juke box hero, got stars in his eyes  
He's a juke box hero, got stars in his eyes  
(Just one guitar) juke box hero, (aah aah aah) got stars in his eyes  
He's just a juke box hero, aah aah aah  
Juke box (stars) hero, (stars, stars) juke box hero, (stars, stars)  
He's got stars in his eyes, stars in his eyes

Staring at each other with accusing eyes keep our voices low  
Don't act surprised  
If the word gets out, yeah, that's alright  
  
I know you're just looking for some sympathy  
but listen you don't know how it gets back to me  
You're getting reckless girl, but that's alright  
  
Don't you know that one cold word is going to lead to another  
and then we'll have nowhere to go  
  
Even if heaven and earth collide tonight  
we'll be all alone in a different light  
I don't care what the world can't see  
It's just between you and me  
  
I see telltale signs of a love in decline  
There should be something to say  
but we don't take the time  
and I don't understand, but that's alright  
  
Now you can turn the page or you can tear me apart  
Don't make an open book out of my private heart  
You should know better now, but that's alright  
  
Don't you know that one cold word is going to lead to another  
and then we'll have nowhere to go  
  
Even if heaven and earth collide tonight  
we'll be all alone in a different light  
I don't care what the world can't see  
It's just between you and me  
  
If we don't work this out we won't recover  
We'll loose this soulfful love for one another  
But with all I've heard and all I've seen  
I'm still lost in your mystery  
  
Staring at each other with accusing eyes keep our voices low  
Don't act surprised if the word gets out  
Yeah that's alright  
  
Don't you know that one cold word is going to lead to another  

You go where the wind blows, leading the life you chose  
Your destination remains unknown  
No one to help you, nobody cares about you  
You're looking for someplace you can call home  
  
Lonely children on the run  
Lonely children need someone  
  
Too many questions, you need to answer to them  
Your information is so incomplete  
You seek directions, you would be lost without them  
Don't let them find you lying in the street  
  
Lonely children on the run  
Lonely children, lonely, need someone  
  
Someone to talk to  
Someone who cares  
Someone who listens  
Is anyone there?  
  
They may detest you, someday they may arrest you  
They stop at nothing to hold you down  
You need to be free, but will they ever let you?  
They won't be happy till you leave town  
  
Lonely children on the run, run on the run  
Lonely children need someone, need someone  
Lonely children in the night, can't see the light  
Lonely children need a guiding light, don't forget  
Lonely children all alone  
Lonely children have no home  
Lonely children on the run  
Hope someday there'll be someone  
Lonely, lonely children

It was a Monday,  
A day like any other day  
I left a small town  
For the Apple in decay  
It was my destiny  
It's what we needed to do  
They were telling me  
I'm telling you  
  
I was inside looking outside  
The millions of faces  
But still I'm alone  
Waiting, hours of waiting  
Paying a penance  
I was longing for home  
I'm looking out for the two of us  
I hope we'll be here  
When they're through with us  
  
I was inside looking outside  
Oh the millions of faces  
But still I'm alone  
Waiting, hours of waiting  
I could feel the tension  
I was longing for home  
I'm looking out for the two of us  
And I hope we'll be here  
When they're through with us  
I'm coming home  
  
Monday, sad, sad Monday  
She's waiting for me  
But I'm a long long way from home  
Sad, sad Monday  
She's waiting for me,  
But I'm a long long way from homw  
Sad, sad Monday  
Ah she's waiting for me,  
But I'm a long, long way from home

Some girls you meet seem so complete  
Like they don't need nothin' from you  
They're out to show you they don't want to know you  
When deep inside they do  
  
Well, this girl didn't want me or anyone else  
She was alone, thought I'd give it a try  
I was a young bull stompin' in the field  
I saw red when she walked by  
  
Love has taken its toll, love has  
Love has taken, taken its toll, oh yeah  
  
I had to think fast, I watched her walk past  
I knew I would have my way  
So I swaggered up, I mean I staggered up  
But I didn't have a damn thing to say  
  
Now, two handed strategy always works well for me  
So I slipped my hands around her waist  
I swore it was the right move, feelin' so smooth  
Till she backhanded me 'cross my face  
  
Love has taken its toll, love has  
Love has taken, taken its toll, oh yeah  
  
To make a long story short, she finally got caught  
I had to tell her enough is enough  
She said, "You're just what I needed", and boy  
She nearly pleaded with me not to be too rough  
  
Love has taken its toll, love has  
Love has taken, taken its toll, oh yeah  
  
Love has taken, taken its toll, love has  
Love has taken, taken its toll, oh yeah  
  
Love has taken, taken its toll, love has  
Love has taken, taken its toll, oh yeah

Monday, Tuesday, three days and more  
Pretty soon you don't know anymore  
Friday, the sixth day, Saturday seems late  
Don't know how much longer I can wait  
  
Ooh, could ya wait 'til I get home  
Ooh, we need to be alone  
'N' I don't wanna lose  
My love on the telephone  
  
You make me nervous 'cause the line's engaged  
I can't believe we let it get to this stage  
Sittin' here waitin' for you to give me a sign  
You know I got my heart on the line  
  
Ooh, I know that I was wrong  
Ooh, I've been away too long  
I can't stand to lose  
My love on the telephone  
  
Hello operator  
You know that I've been waitin' on this call  
I said, hey, operator  
If you're givin' me a bad time  
I'm gonna tear this phone right off the wall  
  
Monday, Tuesday, three days and more  
Pretty soon I don't know anymore  
Friday is the sixth day, Saturday seems late  
Don't know how much longer I can wait  
  
Ooh, could ya wait 'til I get home  
Ooh, we need to be alone  
'N' I don't wanna lose  
My love on the telephone  
  
Ooh, I'm runnin' out of time  
Ooh, my heart is on the line  
'N' I don't wanna lose  
My love on the telephone  
  
Ooh, maybe I was wrong  
Ooh, I've been away too long  
'N' I can't stand to lose  
My love on the telephone  
  
Ooh, could ya wait 'til I get home  
Ooh, we need to be alone  
'N' I don't wanna lose  
My love on the telephone

This is the thirteenth day of waiting, the second long weekend  
These liberties you've taken, have got to end  
This distance you've been keeping, grows wider everyday  
Time is running out, there's nothing left to say  
  
Innocent child, that's what I once believed  
But now I know better, and I ain't gonna let you play that game with me  
I'm telling you mama  
I'm gonna get lowdown and dirty, run wild in the night  
Lowdown and dirty, this time I'll do it right  
Loving every minute, making up for lost time  
I'll get lowdown, lowdown and dirty  
  
A little time to do something, some searching of the soul  
I never knew your heart could be so cold  
You're driven by ambition and you want the best that you can get  
Ambition leads you blindly if you let it  
And I guess you let it  
  
That innocent smile, it fooled me all the way  
It drew me in, but now there's gonna be some hell to pay  
Gonna be hell to pay  
  
I'm gonna get lowdown and dirty, and break every rule  
Lowdown and dirty, nobody gonna treat me like a fool  
Running free and easy, now I'm out on the loose  
I'll get lowdown and dirty, lowdown and dirty tonight  
  
Such an innocent child, you fooled me all the way  
You drew me in, but now there is going to be some hell to pay  
  
I'm gonna get lowdown and dirty, run wild in the night  
Lowdown and dirty, do it good, do it right  
You see I've reaching for something that's been  
Missing in my life  
I've got to get lowdown and dirty, lowdown and dirty tonight  
Got to get, got to get, got to get lowdown and dirty  
If you could see me right now darlin' you'd see me flyin' high,  
Goin' crazy

Luanne, luanne  
Why do you run and hide?  
Luanne, luanne  
Don't keep your love inside  
I wait around for you after school  
You slip away and I don't see you  
Don't know what I'm gonna do  
If you can't see how much I need you  
We met, one day, and then, you ran away  
I've searched the whole town looking for you  
I know you're there somewhere  
Luanne, luanne  
Why do you run and hide?  
Luanne, luanne  
Don't keep your love inside  
I write letters that I never send  
I keep the words to whisper to you someday  
I don't know where and I don't know when  
Luanne I'm gonna get to you someway  
I want to feel your love so close to me  
Give me just half a chance  
To prove myself, I need to  
Luanne, luanne  
Why do you run and hide?  
Luanne, luanne  
Don't keep your love inside  
These days true love is so hard to find  
Someday I know you're gonna be mine  
Luanne, luanne, luanne, ooh  
Luanne, luanne, luanne, luanne  
Why do you run and hide?  
Luanne, luanne, luanne, luanne  
Don't keep your love inside  
Luanne, luanne  
Don't need to run and hide  
Luanne, luanne  
Don't keep your love inside  
Luanne, luanne, luanne, luanne  
I wanna be beside you, can't you understand?  
Luanne, luanne, luanne, luanne  
Give me a little love, I know you can  
Luanne, luanne  
Can't you hear me calling?  
Luanne  

Ain't got no regrets  
And I ain't losin' track of  
Which way I'm going  
I ain't gonna double back, no  
Don't want no misplay  
Put on no display  
And angel no  
But I know my way  
Oh yeah, oh oh, oh oh  
  
I used to follow  
Yeah, that's true  
But my following days are over  
Now I just got to follow thru in  
I remember what my father said  
He said "son, life is simple"  
It's either cherry red  
  
Or midnight blue, oh, oh oh, oh oh  
Midnight blue, (oh) oh oh, ooh oh, oh oh, oh oh  
  
You were the restless one  
And you did not care that  
I was the trouble boy  
Lookin' for a double dare  
I won't apologize for the  
Things I've done and said  
But when I win your heart  
I'm gonna paint it cherry red  
I don't want to talk about it  
What you do to me, I can't live without it  
And you might think that it's  
Much too soon for us to go this far  
  
Into the midnight blue, oh, oh oh, oh oh  
It's midnight blue, (oh) oh oh, ooh oh, oh oh, oh oh  
  
The things could be different  
But that'd be a shame, 'cause  
I'm the one who could feel the sun  
Right in the pouring rain  
I won't say where and I  
Don't know when but  
Soon there's gonna come a day, babe  
I'll be back again  
Yeah, I'll be back for you  
Ah ah ah ah, you see I'm saving up my love  
  
Midnight blue, (oh) oh oh, oh oh  
Into the midnight blue, (oh) oh oh, oh oh  
Another midnight blue, (oh) oh oh, oh oh  
Tonight is midnight blue, (woah) oh oh, oh oh, it's midnight blue  
Into the midnight blue, (oh) oh, oh oh oh  
Midnight blue, oh, oh oh, oh oh  
Midnight blue, oh, oh oh oh  
Tonight is midnight blue, oh, oh oh, oh oh  
Into the midnight blue, oh, oh oh oh

Don't expect me to treat you like a lady  
I may not always show respect  
It's too soon, yet I hardly even know you  
That's just my way, don't get upset, [Incomprehensible]  
Uptill now I've been living like a loner  
Gettin' by, ooh, just gettin' by  
And this heart of mine has only had one owner  
But you could change that if you tried, baby  
Now I don't want a love forever  
And I don't need a master plan  
I just want to come together  
And I want you to understand  
It's the moment of truth and it's finally come this time  
Now we must draw the line  
The moment of truth, this time it's everything  
Open up, let me in, let me right into your heart, oh yeah  
I intend to treat you like a woman  
'Cause I can see you're not a child  
'Cause you've got that look, that certain way of knowin'  
It's got my senses runnin' wild, oh yeah  
Now I don't want a love forever  
And I don't need a master plan  
I just want to come together  
And I want you to understand  
It's the moment of truth and it's finally come this time  
Now we must draw the line  
The moment of truth, this time it's everything  
Open up, let me in  
The moment of truth and it's finally come this time  
Now we must draw the line, the moment of truth this time  
Now I don't want a love forever  
And I don't need a master plan  
I just want to come together  
And I want you to understand  
It's the moment of truth and it's finally come this time  
Now we must draw the line  
The moment of truth, this time it's everything  
Open up, let me in  
The moment of truth, oh  
It's the moment of truth and the time is come  
Moment of truth, moment of truth  
Moment of truth, it's time  
Moment of truth, oh, we gotta draw the line  
Moment of truth, open your heart to me, baby, let me in  
Moment of truth, open your heart, let me in  
Moment of truth  

Wake up in time to see the sun going down  
Turn on the six o'clock news  
See what's happening in this town  
I take a walk down to the corner  
I meet those bad girls hanging around  
Never doing what they oughta  
  
Yeah, I get caught up in the action  
Gotta find the main attraction now  
Gotta get some satisfaction  
You better take me to the heart of that  
  
Night life, looking for some  
Night life, need a little  
Night life, living in the daylight  
Just don't agree with me  
Night life  
  
Stealing through the night like a wolf on the prowl  
Not a bird, not a plane, I'm just a mean old night owl  
Watch me, hit, run, gotta move on  
Going wild in the night  
Cause I'm hooked on the neon  
  
Yeah, I'm looking for some action  
I gotta find my main attraction now  
Cause I need some satisfaction  
Won't you take me to the heart of that  
  
Night life, a little bit of  
Night life, ooh I need some  
Night life, full of bright lights and noise  
Time to separate the men from the boys  
  
Night life

Every time I run away from you  
You searched me out and found me  
I build a wall, surround myself  
But you've found a way around it  
Everywhere I go in this big old world  
You're just one step behind me  
I turn around and there you are  
Ready to remind me  
Woah, baby, let me, let me go  
Honey, don't you know?  
There is no hiding place  
Nowhere to run, no escape  
There is no hiding place, oh no  
There is nowhere safe to disappear without a trace  
There is no hiding place  
I walked the streets the whole night long  
Tryin' to forget you  
I rode the subway end to end  
I wish I'd never met you  
'Coz you got some kinda hold on me  
It's so hard to fight it  
I can't get away from you  
No matter how I try  
Whoa, say you'll let me, let me go  
You've got to let me go  
'Coz there is no hiding place  
Nowhere to run, no escape  
There is no hiding place, oh no  
There is nowhere safe to disappear without a trace  
There is no hiding place, no, no, no, no, no, no, no  
I said, whoa, never let me, let me go  
'Coz baby, no, no  
There is no hiding place  
Nowhere to run, no escape  
There is no hiding place, ohh  
There is nowhere safe to disappear without a trace  
There is no hiding place  
No hiding place, alright  
No hiding place  
There is nowhere safe, gotta disappear without a trace  
There is no hiding place  
Hiding place, baby, don't you know?  
You gotta let this [Incomprehensible]  

Not a lot of time to think today  
It's almost over now  
Didn't need it anyway  
Guess I knew somehow  
  
I feel love around me  
And the feeling grows  
As your love surrounds me  
How was I to know  
That straight out of nowhere  
You'd come to me  
  
Out of the blue  
Into my heart  
You came to me  
Out of the blue  
Into my heart  
  
Never know what life can bring your way  
You never learn  
Over night, from day to day  
Where our love's concerned  
  
It was so hard to hold on  
But I never let go  
For so long, so hard to take  
How was I to know  
That right out of nowhere  
You'd come to me  
  
Out of the blue  
Into my heart  
You came to me  
Out of the blue  
Straight to my heart  
Ooh girl it was you  
You came out of the blue  
Into my heart  
You came to me  
Out of the blue  
Straight to my heart  
  
You came to me  
Out of the blue, into my heart  
Out of the blue  
Straight to my heart  
Ooh girl it was you  
You came out of the blue  
Into my heart  
Out of the blue  
Straight to my heart  
  
You came to me  
Out of the blue  
And into my heart  
Out of the blue  
Straight to my heart

In your book of broken hearts  
You had my name now the story starts  
We'll never be the same again I know  
I'm a victim of circumstance  
  
I'm the one that got the second chance  
One chance...that's all I need, and I won't let go  
Now you've got to understand I'm ready  
I won't be denied  
  
This lonely heart must be satisfied  
You lie waiting far across the sea  
Wild horses could never stop me  
The highest mountain ain't high enough  
  
I'm coming back, gonna take you prisoner of love  
Calling all dreamers, every heart broken fool  
Doing what I can...but, love is cruel  
The highest mountain ain't high enough  
  
I won't give up, gonna take you prisoner of love  
You took the magic of the silver screen  
You've got the look, that dreams are made of  
I'll do anything to make my dreams come true  
  
Now turn this city upside down  
I comb the streets of every lonely town  
I'll never rest, I'm a man possessed  
I need love from you  
  
I know you've got it there and I want it  
I won't be denied  
Your lonely heart will be satisfied  
You lie waiting far across the sea  
  
Wild horses could never stop me  
The highest mountain ain't high enough  
I'm coming back, gonna take you prisoner of love  
Calling all dreamers, every heart broken fool  
  
Doing what I can but love is cruel  
The highest mountain ain't high enough  
I won't give up, gonna take you prisoner of love  
Calling all dreamers, every heart broken fool  
  
Doing what I can but love is cruel  
The highest mountain ain't high enough  
I'm coming back, gonna take you prisoner of love  
Baby, I'll be sailing far across the sea  
  
Wild horses could never stop me  
The highest mountain ain't high enough  
I won't give up, gonna take you prisoner of love  
I'm coming back gonna take you prisoner of love  
  
I'm coming back, I'm coming back  
I won't give up, gonna take you prisoner of love  
I get to your love  
I'm coming back, gonna take you prisoner of love  
  
Take you prisoner of love  
I won't give up, I won't give up, gonna take you prisoner of love  
I'm coming back, gonna take you prisoner of love

Days, times we will remember  
When innocence was lost  
We let our hearts move on  
So many dreams we thought would last forever  
  
Today it doesn't matter  
All those dreams are gone, they are gone, oooh  
Tell me how it feels again  
Oh, show me that it's real and then  
  
I'll walk away, from my own reflection  
The stranger that I knew  
The stranger that was you  
And now I face a cold return to sender  
A truce but no surrender  
A voice that won't ring true, where are you? oooh  
  
I reach over the edge  
And throw a penny in the wishing well  
It's so deep that I can tell  
  
That in the real world  
There's fewer stars in the sky  
And in the real world  
You can get hear children cry at night  
This is the real world  
  
There is no time, for a life of solitude  
Only hunger and survival  
In the world we were born into, we're alone, oooh  
  
And it brings me to my knees  
Our father lay me down to sleep  
Father please  
Pray the lord my soul to keep  
  
Keep us in the real world  
Keep us in the real world  
Don't have to tell you  
In the real world  
  
They'll damn you if you try  
In the real world  
Let it begin with you and I  
  
This is the real world  
There's fewer stars in the sky  
This is the real world  
You can get hear children cry at night  
  
Now in the real world  
They'll damn you if you try  
And in the real world  
Let it begin with you and I  
Living in the real world  
Yeah, living in the real world

Two in a row, everybody knows  
At the green light you rev it on the red line  
Been waitin' all week to get my wheels on the street  
Get my hands on the wheel, slide down in the seat  
  
She's wearin' new colors and runnin' pretty good  
I got four hundred horses tucked under the hood  
But there's no need to panic, it's under control  
We're aerodynamic and ready to roll  
  
Rev on the red line  
You're on your own  
Rev on the red line  
Just let it go  
  
Runnin' all night on lake avenue  
It's a piece of cake  
If you know what to do  
You've got to lose a few  
'Til the stakes get high  
When the odds are right  
You just blow by  
  
And make no mistake, there's women who just wait  
For the man and machine with the best time  
  
Rev on the red line  
You're on your own  
Feels like a lifetime  
But soon you'll know  
  
Wasn't long ago I could've lost my wheels  
Had to outrun the law, it was no big deal  
I guess they had a grudge, they were hot on my tracks  
I had to pay off the judge to get my license back  
Now I need to pin those needles, got to feel that heat  
Hear my motor screamin' while I'm tearin' up the street  
  
Rev on the red line  
You're on your own  
Rev on the red line  
Just let it go  
  
Rev on, rev on  
Rev on, rev on  
  
Don't think I'll ever learn to slow down  
Rev on, you'll still be here and I'll be gone  
Rev on, rev on

Seeing you, watching you  
Watching me  
I hold back my emotions  
I keep them veiled in secrecy  
I can't let go of this thing we've started  
Wasn't looking for love  
No conspiracy of the broken hearted  
I don't know how far to go  
Until I'm gone, gone, gone  
  
I couldn't see the danger  
It was just a little taste of temptation  
I could not read the silence  
That was written on your face  
But here comes that feeling again  
  
And there's nothing more I can do  
I keep running the risk of losing you  
There's nothing more I can say  
I'm still running the risk of you walking away  
  
I'm lost drowning in a sea of emotion  
I've got one simple need  
I need you to feel my devotion  
I don't know how far to go  
Until I'm gone, yeah gone  
  
It's a complicated picture  
I'm all tangled up in temptation  
I couldn't read the silence  
That was written on your face  
But here comes that feeling again  
  
And there's nothing more I can do  
I keep running the risk of losing you  
There's nothing more I can say  
I'm still running the risk of you walking away  
  
I'm running the risk of losing you  
I'm walking this tightrope  
You're my only hope  
There's nothing more I can do  
I keep running the risk of losing you  
Losing you  
  
And there's nothing more I can do  
I keep running the risk of losing you  
There's nothing more I can say  
I'm still running the risk of you walking away  
  
I'm running the risk of losing you  
I'm walking this tightrope  
Darling, you're my only hope  
There's nothing more I can do  
I keep running the risk of losing you  
I'm running the risk of losing you  
  
I'm telling you honey  
This heart of mine can't run the risk  
Of losing you again  
Everything have made you do  
I'm still running the risk of losing you

In this world, life can be hard on a sensitive girl  
Who do you turn to, when you really need someone  
Don't give in, hold on, and in time  
The day will come, and you will know  
That your life has only just begun  
And you will feel love, you'll feel the earth meet the heavens above  
Leave the past behind, now is the time  
Put your trust in me, and believe, when I tell you  
I want you, close to me  
And from now until the end of time  
You'll be safe, safe in my heart, so safe, you know you are  
In this space, in this heart  
There will always be a place for you  
Safe in my heart  
From now on, girl I'll be there, I'll be strong for you  
When you need me, I'll be right here by your side  
Put your trust in me and believe when I tell you  
I need you, close to me  
From now, 'till the end of time, I want you to know  
You are safe, in my heart, so safe, you know you are  
In this space, in this heart  
There's no room, for anyone but you  
I would cry for you, even die for you  
So just listen and remember, there will always be a place  
For you  
Safe in my heart  

Say you will, say you won't make up your mind tonight  
Say you do, say you don't want to be mine  
Say you will, say you won't make up your mind this time  
Say you will, say you will be mine tonight  
I can't sleep, I keep dreaming of losing you  
I feel so alone in the night, scared to open my eyes  
I'm in too deep, I'm in over my head this time  
Can't get you out of my mind, no matter how hard I try  
So won't you say you will, say you won't make up your mind tonight  
Say you will, say you won't be my guide light  
Say you will, say you won't make up your mind this time  
Say you do, say you do, you want to be mine  
I get the feeling I've never been here before  
'cause no one I've known's ever moved me the way that you do  
And I know this is the real thing, it's all I've been searching for  
I put it all on the line, now I'm hoping you feel that way too  
And if you do, why don't you  
Say you will, say you won't make up your mind tonight  
Say you do, say you don't want to be mine  
Now will you say you will, say you won't make up your mind this time  
Say you will, say you will, you'll be mine tonight  
Will you tell me how much I mean to you, will you say you always will be true  
I need more than a come on sign, so won't you say you will be mine  
Now won't you say you will, say you won't make up your mind tonight  
Say you will, say you will be my guide light  
Say you will, say you will make up your mind this time  
Say you do, say you do, you want to be mine  
Come on, come on, say you will make up your mind tonight  
Say you will, say you will be mine tonight  
Be mine tonight, say you will (repeats out)

Late last night  
I get a call from a so-called friend  
He wouldn't give his name  
Says he saw you with another man  
Feels like seventeen years  
It's only seventeen days  
Since I saw the real you  
And I'll let you walk away  
  
You left me broken  
You left me stranded  
The way you play this game of love  
It's just plain underhanded  
I spent a lot of time  
And I spent all my money  
Don't want no other fool  
To put his hands on you  
  
Who you been talkin' to?  
Yeah who you been walkin' with?  
  
Seventeen, you're just seventeen  
Seventeen  
  
They said I was playin' with fire  
I knew I had to take a chance  
I had to take you higher  
To a new experience  
But little did I know  
I'd never get that far  
Girl, you know you put on quite a show  
You're gonna be a star  
  
When you grow older, girl  
You'll remember I told you, girl  
  
Seventeen, you're just seventeen  
Seventeen, seventeen  
  
Seventeen, you're just seventeen  
Seventeen, seventeen  
  
Seventeen, you're only seventeen  
Seventeen, seventeen

My girl, everybody says she's alright  
And I know that she's more than alright  
Well, she's a hard headed woman  
Got a mean attitude  
I may have bitten off more than I can chew  
I get a little light headed  
At her altitude  
But she goes one step higher  
  
If I'm going to spend the rest of my life  
With a woman like that, I better think twice  
  
She's too tough  
I said she's too tough  
From the moment she wakes up  
Her mind is made up  
She's too tough, she's too tough  
  
My girl, she's got a way about her  
I know I can never live without her  
She's a hard headed woman  
So hard to please  
She's got her own way of dealing with me  
I'm out on a limb, I'm a cat up a tree  
But this tree's on fire  
  
I want that woman for the rest of my life  
I don't know if I'm up to payin' the price  
  
She's too tough  
I said that she's too tough  
From the moment she wakes up  
Her mind is made up  
She's too tough  
  
You hear she's too tough  
Well I don't believe  
I'll ever leave her  
She's too tough, she's too tough  
  
Well if I'm gonna spend the rest of my life  
With a woman like her, I'd better think twice  
  
She's too tough  
I said she's too tough  
From the moment she wakes up  
Her mind is made up  
She's too tough, that's right  
  
She's too tough  
If I do what I'm told  
She's gooder than gold to me  
She's too tough  
  
I said she's too tough  
When push comes to shove  
This must be love  
She's too tough  
  
Yeah she's too tough  
Well I don't believe  
I'd ever leave her, never leave her  
She's too tough, she's too tough

Well I woke up this morning  
Took your advice  
I dialed the number  
And I let it ring twice  
Then I hung up  
  
Now I tried to do  
Everything I could  
To save our love  
And make it feel good again  
  
I can't fight it, there's nobody home  
Hard hearted and all alone  
I give you love, you ain't giving it back  
I can't take it  
  
I need to see the soul doctor  
Before the fever begins  
You know I'm searching for the soul doctor  
When love is wearing thin  
Doctor soul is in  
  
I've been kicked in the corner  
I'm down in the dirt  
I can't feel a thing  
But I know it ought to hurt  
  
Now your shaking my spirit  
I'm breaking my back  
I'm too blind to hear it  
So I over react to satisfaction  
If I could get me some  
  
I ain't talking, there's nothing to say  
Misunderstandin', your walking away  
Maybe baby, it's gonna take time, time, time  
  
I need to see the soul doctor  
Before the fever begins  
You know I'm searching for the soul doctor  
When love is wearing thin  
Doctor soul is in  
  
I need to see the soul doctor  
You know things are looking grim  
I keep searching for the soul doctor  
Doctor soul is in  
  
The doctor's soul intention  
Let it be understood  
Can't pull the strings of my heart  
I ain't made out of wood  
  
Now I take what I get  
To get what it takes  
Need a little bit a love  
Got a whole lotta heartaches  
  
I can't fight it, there's nobody home  
Hard hearted and all alone  
Maybe baby, it's gonna take time, time, time  
  
I need to see the soul doctor  
Before the fever begins  
You know I'm searching for the soul doctor  
When love is wearing thin  
Doctor soul is in  
  
I need to see the soul doctor  
You know things are looking grim  
I keep searching for the soul doctor  
Doctor soul is in  
  
Hey, a little bit of soul, oh yeah  
Doctor soul is in  
Heart and soul doctor  
I need to see the soul doctor, soul doctor  
Doctor soul is in  
Doctor, doctor, doctor, doctor save my soul  
Doctor soul is in  
Ooh

I found out the hard way, some things you just cant get  
When I fell in love with a woman I wish I never met  
I was in the wrong place, at the wrong time  
I fell easy prey to an innocent way, I was so blind  
  
I call out her name, I turn around to find her  
She's a spellbinder  
  
I've never been a easy man, so hard to please  
But she made me feel life was unreal, oh Lord, how she satisfied me  
I tried to break away, but I didn't stand a chance  
She planned it so well, I was under her spell, I was in a trance  
  
I call out her name, I turn around to find her  
She's a spellbinder  
  
Now do you know what love can do?  
Oh no, what she puts me through?  
It took so long for me to find her  
Now she won't set me free  
She's a spellbinder  
  
Now do you know what love can do?  
Oh no, what she put me through?  
You say you can't believe, believe that it's true  
Let the spellbinder put a spell on you

I stole a ride on a passing star  
Not knowing where I was going  
How near or how far  
Through years of light, lands of future and past  
Until the heavenly gates  
Were sighted at last  
  
Starrider, rider, rider  
Take me to the stars  
Starrider, rider, rider  
Show me where you are  
  
Northern lights flashed by  
And then they were gone  
And as old stars would die  
So the new ones were born  
  
And ever on I sailed  
Celestial ways  
And in the light of my years  
Shone the rest of my days  
  
Speed increasing  
All control is in the hands of those who know  
Will they help us grow  
To one day be starriders  
  
Starrider, rider, rider  
Show me where you are  
Starrider, rider, rider  
Take me to the stars  
  
Speed increasing  
All control is in the hands of those who know  
Will they help us grow  
To one day be starriders

I thought I knew you well  
But all this time I could never tell  
I let you get away  
Haunts me every night and every day  
  
You were the only one  
The only friend I counted on  
How could I watch you walk away  
I'd give anything to have you here today  
  
But now I stand alone with my pride  
And dream that you're still by my side  
  
But that was yesterday  
I had the world in my hands  
But it's not the end of my world  
Just a slight change of plans  
That was yesterday  
But today life goes on  
No more hiding in yesterday  
Cause yesterday's gone, ooooh!  
  
Love, my love I gave it all  
Thought I saw the light, when I heard you call  
Life that we both could share  
Has deserted me, left me in despair  
  
But now I stand alone with my pride  
Fighting back the tears I never let myself cry  
  
But that was yesterday  
Love was torn from my hands  
But it's not the end of my world  
Just a little hard to understand  
That was yesterday  
But today life goes on  
You won't find me in yesterday's world  
Now yesterday's gone  
Goodbye yesterday  
Now it's over and done  
Still I hope somewhere deep in your heart  
Yesterday will live on, ooooh!

Ooh the beat of my heart  
Ooh the beat of my heart  
  
Always here  
I'll be close to you  
But you won't see me  
On the street or underground  
I'll be there somewhere  
You can look around  
You can listen out  
But you won't find me  
Beyond the shadow  
Of a doubt  
Oh I'll be there for you  
  
You've been living in another world  
Ever since I met you  
Don't wanna treat you like a little girl  
I know you better  
  
The beat of my heart  
If you listen closely now  
To the beat of my heart  
You'll find your way  
H-o-m-e  
The beat of my heart  
You won't be lonely  
  
Girl I'm here  
And I'll always be  
There when you need me  
Close at hand  
Never far away  
I'll be there for you  
  
You're such a crazy little pretty girl  
How could I ever forget you  
You tried to take me to another world  
But I wouldn't let you  
  
And the beat of my heart  
If you listen closely now  
To the beat of my heart  
You won't be lonely  
The beat of my heart  
Better listen to me now  
The beat of my heart  
Calling you  
H-o-m-e  
Ooh the beat of my heart  
You won't be lonely  
  
You've been living in another world  
Ever since I met you  
Don't wanna treat you like a little girl  
I know you better  
  
And the beat of my heart  
If you listen closely now  
To the beat of my heart  
You won't be lonely  
The beat of my heart  
Better listen closely now  
The beat of my heart  
And it's calling you  
H-o-m-e  
  
Ooh the beat of my heart  
If you listen closely now  
For the beat of my heart  
You'll find your way home  
H-o-m-e  
  
Ooh the beat of my heart  
Ooh the beat of my heart  
It's calling you  
H-o-m-e

Is there a reason  
For things that you say?  
The way you're treating me  
All the games I won't play  
Well it's too late, no longer one  
Don't want you, the damage is done  
  
Will you miss me  
When I leave you behind?  
Will you tell your friends  
I treated you unkind?  
Well it's over now, and I'm on the run  
I don't want you, the damage is done  
  
There have been rumors  
That my sense of humor is lacking in some ways  
To me that's no reason, it's tantamount to treason  
See what the judge has to say  
You need to find someone half as blind  
As I am to your games  
And maybe you'll find out what it's all about  
And it can drive you insane  
  
Ooh the damage is done  
And now I feel it's too late  
The damage is done  
It's over  
Now I'm on the run  
And baby you and I know  
The damage is done  
  
I feel it's too late  
The damage is done

I know this girl, she's always on my mind  
She lives in her world and I live in mine  
I should forget about her and I've tried, oh Lord knows I've tried  
But I want to know her, and here's the other side  
  
I've got someone waiting for me every night  
She's the only one I've ever loved, it's been that way for the longest time  
And she's the one that makes my world go right  
And it tears me in two because I know where I'll be tonight  
  
I think she knows it  
I think she knows  
  
I live in two different worlds, two different worlds  
One that belongs to me, one could be wrong for me  
Two different worlds, two different worlds  
Ohh, it's two different worlds  
  
Is she that different or is it the thrill of someone new?  
Strung out on her, I need her love, I need it bad, that I know, I know it's
true  
I'm the one that lies awake alone  
And I know, she's the one that makes me stray from home  
  
And I know it  
Yeah, I know it  
  
I live in two different worlds, two different worlds  
One that I may regret, one that I can't forget  
Two different worlds, two different worlds  
Oh, it's two different worlds  
  
No, I can't explain this emptiness  
No, I know that I can't go on like this  
Two different worlds, two different worlds  
  
Oh, it's two different worlds, I live in two different worlds  
One that I may regret, and one that I won't forget  
Two different worlds, but I can't live in both, I know  
One world I must let go

Good girl on a bad day  
She needs love in a bad way  
Victim in a red dress  
She won't give no more  
And won't take no less  
Walking up the west side  
She bought a ticket for the long ride  
Well she's ripe for the take  
  
But it's no show, late night  
Talkin' 'bout no go, red light  
When she put on a show  
How far will she go  
She says yes when she means no  
  
Under the gun  
She can't walk away  
She can't run, mmm  
Under the gun, yeah, under the gun  
  
She's got wicked intentions  
She'll use less than conventional ways  
She'll do things I can't mention  
But there are some games  
That she just won't play  
Walking on the wild side, wild side  
She bought a ticket for the long ride, long ride  
Yeah she's mine for the take  
  
But it's no show, late night  
Talkin' 'bout no go, red light  
When she put on a show  
How far will she go  
She says yes when she means no  
  
Under the gun  
She can't walk away  
She can't run  
Under the gun, yeah, under the gun  
  
Under the gun  
Now, she can't walk away  
You can't run  
Under the gun, under the gun  
  
When she put on a show  
How far will she go  
She says yes when she means no  
  
Under the gun  
She can't walk away  
She can't run  
Under the gun, yeah, under the gun  
  
Under the gun  
She can't walk away  
You can't run  
Under the gun, under the gun  
  
Under the gun  
Now, you can't walk away  
You can't run  
Under the gun, under the gun  
  
Under the gun  
You can't walk away  
Under the gun

When I was young and the world belonged to me,  
I thought that love meant pain and jealousy.  
It was a cross on my shoulder.  
Oh, Lord, now I feel so much older.  
Mmm. Mmm.  
  
Time had a way of making me see my lonely life has taken its toll on me.  
Now, I feel the emptiness and I don't wanna live like this.  
Now, I've heard stories, I've heard songs telling me believe my heart.  
Don't wait too long with words that don't ring true until there was you.  
  
Never will I lose this heart's desire.  
Ever will I feel our love's fire only when I know  
That you'll be mine until the end of time.  
  
How do I trust what I'm beginning to feel,  
And how deep my soul, how much can I reveal?  
I'm lost in love's mystery, caught between time and eternity.  
Now, there's a door that opens wide.  
Slowly I will find my way and I'll reach inside.  
But I couldn't make it through until there was you.  
  
Never will I lose this heart's desire.  
Ever will I feel our love's fire only when I know  
That you'll be mine and only when I see  
The light of love shine until the end of time.  
Never will I lose this heart's desire.  
Ever will I feel our love's fire.  
And when I see the light of love shine in your eyes when they meet mine,  
Only then I'll know it's you and I until the end of time.

My mind tells me, what will be, shall be  
Not a thing I can do about it  
'Cause in my heart, I can't do without it  
It's so cold out here like minus ten degrees  
And I'm trying to get through to you, baby  
I've got my heart on ice and it's about to freeze, yeah  
Only you can pull me through  
'Cause I want some of your unusual heat, yeah  
And I need more and more, unusual heat  
My body tells me, hold on, I gotta hold on  
But I'm so cold and hungry  
All stretched out like a month of Sundays  
I've been out of my head from that very first day  
Searchin' for somebody like you  
I've been stumblin' around, every step of the way, alright  
And only you can pull me through  
'Cause I want some of your unusual heat, yeah  
And I need more and more, unusual heat, yeah, yeah  
I need it every way, every minute of the day  
Baby, I'm yours, I'll do anything you say  
If you just give me some of your warm unusual heat, yeah  
It's so cold out here, I'm about to freeze  
But I'm still trying to get through to you  
I've got my heart on ice, oh baby please, please, please  
Only you can pull me through  
'Cause I want some of your unusual heat, yeah  
And I need more and more, unusual heat, oh  
I need it every way, every minute of the day  
Baby, I'm yours, I'll do anything you say  
If you just give me some of your warm  
Baby, won't you keep me warm with your unusual heat, yeah  
Unusual, unusual heat, yeah, yeah  

You're not shy, you get around  
You want to fly, don't want your feet on the ground  
You stay up, you won't come down  
You want to live, you want to move to the sound  
Got fire in your veins, burning hot, but you don't feel the pain  
Your desire is insane, you can't stop until you do it again  
  
But sometimes I wonder, as I look in your eyes  
Maybe you're thinking of some other guy  
But I know, yes I know how to treat you right  
That's why you call me in the middle of the night, you say  
  
It's urgent, so urgent, so urgent, just wait and see  
How urgent my love can be, it's urgent  
  
You play tricks on my mind, you're everywhere, but you're so hard to find  
You're not warm, you're sentimental  
You're so extreme, you can be so temperamental  
  
But I'm not looking for a love that'll last  
I know what I need and I need it fast  
Yeah there's one thing in common that we both share  
That's our need for each other anytime, anywhere  
  
It gets urgent, so urgent, you know it's urgent  
I want to tell you it's the same for me  
So urgent, just wait and see, how urgent my love can be, it's urgent  
  
You say it's urgent, make it fast, make it urgent  
Do it quick, do it urgent, gotta run, make it urgent  
Wait it quick, want it urgent, urgent, emergency, urgent, urgent, emergency  
Urgent, urgent, emergency, urgent, urgent, emergency  
So urgent, emergency

So long, I've been looking too hard, I've been waiting too long  
Sometimes I don't know what I will find, I only know it's a matter of, time  
  
When you love someone, when you love someone  
It feels so right, so warm and true, I need to know if you feel it too  
Maybe I'm wrong, won't you tell me if I'm coming on too strong  
This heart of mine has been hurt before, this time I want to be sure  
  
I've been waiting for a girl like you to come into my life  
I've been waiting for a girl like you, your loving will survive  
I've been waiting for someone new to make me feel alive  
Yeah, waiting for a girl like you to come into my life  
  
You're so good, when we make love it's understood  
It's more than a touch or a word can say  
Only in dreams could it be this way  
  
When you love someone, yeah, really love someone  
Now I know it's right, from the moment I wake up till deep in the night  
There's nowhere on earth that I'd rather be than holding you tenderly  
  
I've been waiting for a girl like you to come into my life  
I've been waiting for a girl like you, your loving will survive  
I've been waiting for someone new to make me feel alive  
Yeah, waiting for a girl like you to come into my life  
  
I've been waiting, waiting for you, ooh, I've been waiting  
I've been waiting  
(I've been waiting for a girl like you, I've been waiting)  
Won't you come into my life?

I remember the day  
Seems so far away  
When I walked into your life  
And the look in your eyes  
How it took you by surprise  
But it felt so right  
Then I drew you in  
Told you anything  
'cause I wanted you so bad  
Girl I led you on  
Said there's nothing wrong  
In giving your heart to me  
But when it comes to love  
I should know better  
When it comes to love  
I take the blame  
'cause you are the one I should've held on to  
Yeah, it coulda ben you  
I never realized  
How time was on my side  
Lost sight of my perfect world  
And the man that I've become  
From the damage that I've done  
It's so clear to me now  
But I wished that I  
Never was the kind  
To steal a lonely heart  
And I didn't see how good you were for me  
Now it's too late to go back  
'cause when it comes to love  
I should know better  
When it comes to love  
I take the blame  
'cause you are the one I should've held on to  
When it comes to love  
Girl I can't help it  
When it comes to love  
I always lose my way  
And you are the one I should've held on to  
Ah, it coulda been you  
Making a change in my heart  
Finding a new place to start  
Wondering what I can do  
Will I ever get over you... no  
When it comes to love  
I should know better  
When it comes to love  
I take the blame  
'cause you are the one I should've held on to  
When it comes to love  
Girl I can't help it  
When it comes to love  
I always lose my way  
And you are the one I should've held on to  
Ah, it could've been you  

Search through the years  
And you wipe away the tears  
To find a woman, not a girl  
Just that feeling, like the beginning of the world  
  
Beginning of the world  
  
And your love flows down like a river  
'Til it reaches down to the sea  
And it's then you start to thinking  
Will the water, will the water cover me?  
  
Woman oh woman  
Don't bury me alive  
Just make me feel I've the right to survive  
Woman oh woman  
I hope that you can see  
This is nothing like our love was meant to be  
Love was meant to be  
  
You search through the years  
And you wipe away the tears  
To find a woman, not a girl  
But a feeling, like the beginning of the world  
  
Woman oh woman  
Don't bury me alive  
Just make me feel I've the right to survive  
Woman oh woman  
I hope that you can see  
This is nothing like our love was meant to be  
  
Woman oh woman  
Woman oh woman  
Woman oh woman  
Woman oh woman  
  
Woman oh woman  
Oh woman

Women behind bars, women in fast cars, women in distress, women with no dress  
Women in airplanes, women who play games  
Women in uniform, see that woman with her clothes gone  
  
Women who satisfy, women you can't buy  
Like women in magazines, and women in a limousine  
Women who sip champagne, women who feel no pain  
Women in a disco, and women who don't want to know, no no  
  
Oh, women wanting sympathy, women feeling ecstasy  
Women who live in fantasies, bringing man to his knees  
  
Women who boil to love, women who need a shove  
Women who can't be beat, get that woman in the back seat, yeah yeah  
Women in the USA, those women steal your heart away  
Women into rock 'n' roll, women who steal the show, go go go  
  
Women that you write songs about, women that turn around and kick you out  
Women you dream about all your life  
Women that stab you in the back with a switchblade knife  
  
Oh women, oohoo, talking 'bout women, all 'round the world  
Yeah women, all the naughty girls, talking 'bout women, come on baby

I never knew a man could be so lonely  
That life would treat a man so wrong  
But when the odds were all against me  
You gave me the strength to carry on  
  
You gave me a new start, so I will give you my heart  
  
You, you are my life, you're all I am  
Only you can understand the way I am  
  
You never give me enough of your love  
I need more and more each day  
Honey, can't you see the only thing I can be sure of  
Is that something real has come my way  
  
Oh, so I believe my heart, though sometimes it tears me apart  
  
You, you are my life, you're all I am  
Baby it's you, you are my life, you're all I am  
Only you can understand the way I am  
  
You know I live my life for you  
  
You are my life, you're all I am  
Ooh baby it's true, you are my life, you're all I am  
Only you can understand the way I am
