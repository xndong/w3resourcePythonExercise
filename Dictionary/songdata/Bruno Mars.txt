Hands over my head thinking 'what else could go wrong? '  
Would've stayed in bed, how can a day be so long?  
Never believed that things happen for a reason  
But how this turned out removed all my doubts, so believe  
That for you I'll do it all over again  
Do it all over again  
All I went through, led me to you  
So I'd do it all over again  
For you  
  
I missed the first train, stood out in the rain, all day  
Little did I know  
When I caught the next train, there you were to sweep me away  
Guess that's what I've waited for  
Never believed that things happened for a reason  
But how this turned out, you moved all my doubts, So believe  
That for you I'd do it all over again  
Do it all over again  
All I went through, led me to you  
So I'd do it all over again  
  
(Ohhohoh) Who ever thought a day gone so wrong, would turn out so lovely?  
I'm so glad I found you  
Even though the day went so wrong, I wouldn't change a thing (yeah, yeah, oh
I'll do it)  
I'd do it all over again  
Do it all over again  
All I went through, led me to you  
So I'd do it all over again (yeah, yeah ohhh)  
I'd do it all over again (I'd do it all over, I'd do it all over)  
Do it all over again (I'd do it all over for you, for you)  
All I went through, led me to you (all I went through, it led me to you)  
So I'd do it all over again (over again)  
  
Who ever thought a day gone so wrong, could turn out so lovely?  
Who ever thought a day gone so wrong, could turn out so lovely?

Once again you're home alone  
Tears running from your eyes  
And I'm on the outside  
Knowing that you're all I want  
But I can't do anything  
I'm so helpless baby  
  
Everyday same old things  
So you're still feelin' pain  
Never had real love before  
And it ain't her fault  
  
She knows better but  
She can't help it  
Wanna tell her  
But would that be selfish  
How do you heal  
A heart that can't feel, it's broken  
His love is all she knows, all she knows, all she knows  
His love is all she knows, all she knows, all she knows  
  
You've been livin' this way so long  
You don't know the difference  
And it's killing me  
Cause you can have so much more  
I'm the one your looking for  
But you close your eyes on me  
So you still can't see  
  
Everyday same old things  
So you're still feelin' pain  
Never had real love before  
And it ain't her fault  
  
She knows better but  
She can't help it  
Wanna tell her  
But would that be selfish  
How do you heal  
A heart that can't feel, it's broken  
His love is all she knows, all she knows, all she knows  
His love is all she knows, all she knows, all she knows  
  
All she knows is the pain  
In the corner of an empty home  
She's still comfortable  
I want her to know  
It can be better than this  
I can't pretend  
Wish we were more than friends  
  
Everyday same old things  
So you're still feelin' pain  
Never had real love before  
And it ain't her fault  
  
She knows better but  
She can't help it  
Wanna tell her  
But would that be selfish  
How do you heal  
A heart that can't feel, it's broken  
His love is all she knows, all she knows, all she knows  
His love is all she knows, all she knows, all she knows

It's not a question of love,  
Cause our love has never changed.  
But all the little things keep piling up,  
And life keeps getting in the way.  
  
Don't make this harder than it is,  
We both knew it'd come to this.  
Better now than in a year,  
With lots of tears,  
And we both hate each other.  
The fuse has already left,  
So how about a final kiss?  
And just let it go.  
  
Stop the madness,  
Before it explodes!  
Before it's out of our control.  
Let's stop the madness,  
Before it explodes!  
We gotta let it go,  
Before it all explodes.  
  
Some things we won't understand,  
And we're both so tired of being misunderstood.  
So let's just turn and walk away,  
And hold on to what was good.  
  
Don't make this harder than it is,  
We both knew it'd come to this.  
Better now than in a year,  
With lots of tears,  
And we both hate eachother.  
The fuse has already left,  
So how about a final kiss?  
And just let it go.  
  
Stop the madness,  
Before it explodes!  
Before it's out of our control.  
Let's stop the madness,  
Before it explodes!  
We gotta let it go,  
Before it all explodes.  
  
Before it explodes!  
Before it's out of our control.  
Let's stop the madness,  
Before it explodes!  
We gotta let it go,  
Before it all explodes.

I wanna be a billionaire so freakin' bad  
Buy all of the things I never had  
Uh, I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine  
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen  
  
Oh every time I close my eyes  
I see my name in shining lights  
Yeah, a different city every night oh right  
I swear the world better prepare  
For when I'm a billionaire  
  
Yeah I would have a show like Oprah  
I would be the host of, everyday Christmas  
Give Travie a wish list  
I'd probably pull an Angelina and Brad Pitt  
And adopt a bunch of babies that ain't never had shit  
Give away a few Mercedes like here lady have this  
And last but not least grant somebody their last wish  
It's been a couple months that I've been single so  
You can call me Travie Claus minus the Ho Ho  
Get it, hehe, I'd probably visit where Katrina hit  
And damn sure do a lot more than FEMA did

For when I'm a billionaire  
Oh ooh oh ooh for when I'm a billionaire  
Oh ooh oh ooh for when I'm a billionaire  
  
I'll be playing basketball with the President  
Dunking on his delegates  
Then I'll compliment him on his political etiquette  
Toss a couple milli in the air just for the heck of it  
But keep the five, twenties tens and bens completely separate  
And yeah I'll be in a whole new tax bracket  
We in recession but let me take a crack at it  
I'll probably take whatever's left and just split it up  
So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks  
And not a single tummy around me would know what hungry was  
Eating good sleeping soundly  
I know we all have a similar dream  
Go in your pocket pull out your wallet  
And put it in the air and sing  
  
I wanna be a billionaire so fuckin' bad  
Buy all of the things I never had  
Uh, I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine  
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen

A different city every night all right

Oh ooh oh ooh for when I'm a billionaire

She wakes up in the morning, jumps in the shower  
Then rubs on her lotion, while she's wrapped in a towel  
And no music on, but she dance till perfection  
I swear the bathrooms the club, the ways she's showing love to her reflection

And so then you've temporally lost your mind,  
And now you're checking your phone and you've noticed  
It's not ringing (waoh),  
And the one that you wanted to call you pushed out your life,

I'm without her somewhere far away  
I keep thinking about her but I know I can't stay  
She haunts me like a nightmare her image is everywhere  
She doesn't leave me alone  
I can't escape her or erase her  
When I know she's not coming home  
  
I can't understand where I went wrong  
I can't understand where her love has gone  
I don't know where I belong  
My world is over  
When life goes on (her world goes on) and on and on  
(Her world goes on)  
When life goes on (her world goes on) and on and on  
(My world is gone)  
  
Am I crazy or just human  
Is this what heartbreak is  
What should I be doing  
It feels like I got seconds to live  
She haunts me like a nightmare her image is everywhere  
She doesn't leave me alone  
I can't escape her or erase her  
When I know she's not coming home  
  
I can't understand where I went wrong  
I can't understand where her love has gone  
I don't know where I belong  
My world is over  
When life goes on (her world goes on) and on and on  
(Her world goes on)  
When life goes on (her world goes on) and on and on  
(My world is gone)  
  
My world is over while her world goes on  
(... I don't know where I belong  
My world is over)  
When life goes on (her world goes on) and on and on  
(Her world goes on)  
When life goes on (her world goes on) and on and on  
(My world is gone)

Oh, oh I, I was a city boy  
Riding to danger's where I'd always run above and is hurt

All the things that I've done

Her hair, her hair  
Falls perfectly without her trying  
  
She's so beautiful  
And I tell her every day  
  
Yeah,  
I know, I know  
When I compliment her  
She wont believe me  
It's so, it's so  
Sad to think she don't see what I see  
But every time she asks me do I look okay  
I say  
  
When I see your face (face)  
There's not a thing that I would change  
'Cause girl you're amazing (amazing)  
Just the way you are  
And when you smile (smile)  
The whole world stops and stares for awhile  
'Cause girl you're amazing (amazing)  
Just the way you are  
Yeah  
  
Her lips, her lips  
I could kiss them all day if she'd let me  
Her laugh, her laugh  
She hates but I think it's so sexy  
She's so beautiful  
And I tell her everyday  
  
Oh you know, you know, you know  
I'd never ask you to change  
If perfect's what you're searching for  
Then just stay the same  
So don't even bother asking if you look okay  
You know I'll say!  
  
When I see your face (face)  
There's not a thing that I would change  
'Cause girl you're amazing (amazing)  
Just the way you are  
And when you smile (smile)  
The whole world stops and stares for awhile  
'Cause girl you're amazing (amazing)  
Just the way you are  
  
The way you are  
The way you are  
Girl you're amazing (amazing)  
Just the way you are (are)  
  
When I see your face (face)  
There's not a thing that I would change  
'Cause girl you're amazing (amazing)  
Just the way you are  
And when you smile  
The whole world stops and stares for awhile  
'Cause girl you're amazing  
Just the way you are, yeah

I don't recognize my reflection  
All I see is a product of your deception  
Gave you all of me without question  
But you had to take advantage of a blessing  
I warned you, I told you it would end this way  
If you kept on playing all those childish games  
But just like every other man you're all the same  
Revenge is sweet I love the taste it's giving me  
  
I'm a killer on the run  
You broke my heart and now you're staring at my gun  
Click clack now watch me pull this trigger just for fun  
Was once a good girl now a killer on the run  
K-k-killer, k-k-killer, k-k-killer  
K-k-killer on the run  
Killer on the run  
K-k-killer on the run  
  
Wipe those tears from your eyes it's too late  
With that rag in your mouth can't tell what you say  
Tied to the train tracks begging me for mercy  
This is gonna hurt you more than it hurts me  
I warned you, I told you it would end this way  
If you kept on playing all those childish games  
But just like every other man you're all the same  
Revenge is sweet I love the taste it's giving me  
  
I'm a killer on the run  
You broke my heart and now you're staring at my gun  
Click clack now watch me pull this trigger just for fun  
Was once a good girl now a killer on the run  
K-k-killer, k-k-killer, k-k-killer  
K-k-killer on the run  
Killer on the run  
K-k-killer on the run

What are you fucking crazy?  
It's getting hard to wait,  
I'm trying to make her see,  
That she don't really knows  
That I'm trying to find a way,  
And tell her every day, that she just goes along  
So I...  
I don't wanna be,  
The only one that knows  
That somebody could come along and just  
Say the love for me,  
I'm standing shaking ground,  
And I'm been thinking that I'm gonna lose it,  
  
Chorus:  
Cause I'm losing my head,  
I'm losing my mind,  
I'm losing control of myself this time.  
She's got me losing my head,  
I'm losing my mind,  
I'm losing my way,  
But I think she feels I'm already caught.  
  
Are you talking to me?  
I'm already caught.  
  
I wish that I could see,  
But it's making you  
Feel this should be.  
My love is like gunshot  
All it takes is a shot for me to blow it all away.  
I don't wanna feel like I'm just wasting time, It's gonna be with you and no
one else.  
Until you notice me,  
I need to know right now  
Cause I've been think it that I'm gonna lose it  
  
Chorus:  
Cause I'm losing my head,  
I'm losing my mind,  
I'm losing control of myself this time.  
She's got me losing my head,  
I'm losing my mind,  
I'm losing my way,  
But I think she feels I'm already caught.  
  
Give me a chance to...  
But girl you make me nervous,  
By now you should have noticed me.  
And what will it take it  
To a heavenly...  
You're driving me insane!  
  
Chorus:  
Cause I'm losing my head,  
I'm losing my mind,  
I'm losing control of myself this time.  
She's got me losing my head,  
I'm losing my mind,  
I'm losing my way,  
But I think she feels I'm already caught.

Now Hollywood wants to make you think they know what love is. But I'm a tell
you what true love is. Love is not what you see in the movies. It's not the
ecstasy it's not what you see in that scene you know what I mean? I'm telling
you right now true love is sacrifice. Love is thinking about others before you
think about yourself love is selfless not selfish. Love is God and God is
love. Love is when you lay down your life for another whether for your brother
your mother your father or your sister it's even laying down your life for
your enemies that's unthinkable but think about that. Love is true. Think.  
  
I'll put you in front of me  
So everybody can see  
My love this is my love  
  
I know that I'll be alright  
As long as you are my guide  
My love this is my love  
  
Love is patient love is kind. It does not envy it does not boast it is not
proud. It is not rude it is not self-seeking it is not easily angered it keeps
no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the
truth. It always protects always trusts always hopes it always perseveres.  
Love never fails. Love is everlasting it's eternal it goes on and on it goes
beyond time love is the only thing that will last when you die but ask the
question why? Do you have love?  
  
I'll put you in front of me  
So everybody can see  
My love this is my love  
  
I know that I'll be alright  
As long as you are my guide  
My love this is my love  
  
There is no greater love than this than he who lays down his life for his
friends. Now are you willing to lay down your life for your friends? You're
probably willing to lay down your life for your mother your father or your
best friends but are you willing to lay down your life for even those that
hate you? I'm going to tell you who did that the definition of love is Jesus
Christ. He is love. The nails in his hands the thorns in his brow hanging on a
cross for your sin my sins that is love he died for you and me while we still
hated him that is love. God is true love and if you don't know this love now
is the time to know perfect love.  
  
I'll put you in front of me  
So everybody can see  
My love this is my love  
  
I know that I'll be alright  
As long as you are my guide  
My love this is my love

Madly In Love With You  
  
See you down there everyday  
Trying to find a different way  
To build some kind of latter to the sky  
  
Trying to find some way to see  
Secrets of eternity, and they don't come all at once  
And you don't know why  
  
Well how do you think it feels to hear you screaming out my name  
While all the while I'm trying to open up your heart  
See you when you cry yourself to sleep  
It's tearing me apart  
  
I know you wish you could see me  
That's the way it has to be  
Someday you'll understand,  
Don't you lose your faith in me  
  
I know you wish you could hear me  
Sometimes it's so hard to do  
But every morning sunrise it says  
I'm madly in love with you  
Yes I'm madly in love with you  
Yes I'm madly in love with you  
Yes I'm madly in love with you  
  
I know that you're waiting for,  
A chance to come in from the war  
If only a moment, if only a day  
  
A place where you feel safe and warm  
A sanctuary from the storm  
Until all of these questions fade away  
  
But I cannot count on all the signs  
You've passed away as mere coincidence  
And I'm running out of ways to break through  
Like a lonely lover, Waiting by the ocean  
I'll never give up on you  
  
I know you wish you could see me  
That's the way it has to be  
Someday you'll understand,  
Don't you lose your faith in me  
  
I know you wish you could hear me  
Sometimes it's so hard to do  
But every morning sunrise it says  
I'm madly in love with you  
Yes I'm madly in love with you  
Yes I'm madly in love with you  
Yes I'm madly in love with you

Your love got me trippin'  
But now that you're flippin'  
With my heart,  
We were flying high but we're dipping  
In my heart,  
Ohh I am a fool for you,  
I go running home  
Everytime, you walk out on me  
I thought we were going strong but now it's easy to see my mama was right
you're my  
Mama's worst nightmare no doubt about that  
You are my mama's worst nightmare  
No doubt that you are  
Your love got me running  
But now that you're cunning  
Little plans  
Ohh have got me flipping  
And dipping  
You're cunning whilst  
I'm running  
You're my, you're my, you're myyy  
My mama's worst nightmare no  
Mama's worst nightmare no doubt about that  
You are my mama's worst nightmare  
No doubt that you are

Hello  
You know you look even better than the way you did now before  
And the moment that you kissed my lips you know I started to feel wonderful  
It's something incredible, there's sex in your chemicals  
Oh, let's go  
You're the best way I know to escape the extraordinary  
This world ain't for you, and I know for damn sure this world ain't for me  
Lift off and say goodbye  
Just let your fire set me free  
  
Moonshine, take us to the stars tonight  
Take us to that special place  
That place we went the last time, the last time  
  
I know, I was with you last night but it feels like it's been so long  
And everybody that's around they know that I'm not myself when you gone  
It's good to see you again, good to see you again  
On top of the world, is where I stand when you're back in my life  
Life's not so bad when you're way up this high  
Everything is alright, everything is alright  
  
Moonshine, take us to the stars tonight  
Take us to that special place  
That place we went the last time, the last time, oh  
  
Moonshine, your love it makes me come alive  
Take us to that special place  
That place we went the last time, the last time  
  
Tu-ru-tu don't you never look back  
We are not afraid to die young and live fast  
Give me good times, give me love, give me laughs  
Let's take a ride to the sky before the night is gone  
  
Moonshine, take us to the stars tonight  
Take us to that special place  
That place we went the last time, the last time, oh  
  
Moonshine, your love it makes me come alive

That place we went the last time, the last time

Oh I never done this before  
Never wanna do this again  
Long turn on a dusty road  
I did it to myself so I can't pretend  
Well I learned just a little too late  
Good God I must've been blind  
'Cause she got me for everything, everything, everything, alright  
Like my daddy I'm a gambling man  
Never been afraid to roll the dice  
But when I put my bet on her  
Little miss snake eyes ruined my life  
She better sleep with one eye open  
Better make sure to lock her door  
'Cause once I get my hands on her, I'ma oh  
  
Natalie, she ran away with all my money  
And she did it for fun  
Natalie, she's probably out there thinking it's funny  
Telling everyone  
Well I'm digging a ditch for this gold-digging bitch  
Watch out she's quick  
Look out for a pretty little thing named Natalie  
If you see her tell her I'm coming  
She better run  
  
The good lord better bless your soul  
'Cause I done already cursed your name  
Don't matter which way you go  
Payback's gonna come your way  
You'll be begging me, please please please  
And now I look at you, and laugh, laugh, laugh  
While you sit there and cry for me, cry for me, cry for me all night  
I spend your lifetime in jail (yeah that's what I do)  
I'll be smiling in my cell (yeah thinking bout you)  
Can't nobody save you now  
So there ain't no use in trying  
Once I get my hands on you, I'ma oh  
  
Natalie, she ran away with all my money  
And she did it for fun  
Natalie, she's probably out there thinking it's funny  
Telling everyone  
Well I'm digging a ditch for this gold-digging bitch  
Watch out she's quick  
Look out for a pretty little thing named Natalie  
If you see her tell her I'm coming  
She better run  
  
I should've known better (I should've known better)  
'Cause when we were together ('Cause when we were together)  
She never said forever (She never said forever)  
I'm a fool that played her game  
  
Hey, Natalie, she ran away with all my money  
And she did it for fun  
Natalie, she's probably out there thinking it's funny  
Telling everyone  
Well I'm digging a ditch for this gold-digging bitch  
Watch out she's quick  
Look out for a pretty little thing named Natalie  
If you see her tell her I'm coming  
She better run

[Intro:]  
Oh [x4]  
  
[Verse 1:]  
When I was just a little boy  
Barely strong enough to stand  
I could always count on him  
Oh  
  
He thought me everything I know  
And 'till this day it shows  
  
He was more than just a friend (Ah ah ah)  
  
[Pre-Chorus:]  
There were so many times I would doubt myself  
But his words were always there to help  
  
[Chorus:]  
How would it be?  
Where I am?  
If my father didn't tell me  
To never say I can't  
  
He'd carry me  
And never let me fall  
Oh and the only thing he asked  
Right before he passed  
Was to never say you can't  
  
Oh  
Never say you can't  
Oh oh oh Oh  
  
[Verse 2:]  
So when last rain begins to fall  
And you're out there on your own  
And you can't see a thing  
No no no  
  
Just find a voice that understands  
For me it was my old man  
Taught me to say the words I can  
Oh  
  
[Pre-chorus:]  
There were so many times I would doubt myself  
But his words were always there to help  
  
[Chorus:]  
How would it be?  
Where I am?  
If my father didn't tell me  
To never say I can't  
  
He'd carry me  
And never let me fall  
Oh and the only thing he asked  
Right before he passed  
Was to never say you can't  
  
[Bridge:]  
Everything he taught me would stay with me forever  
No I won't forget a thing  
Oh because of dad I now know myself better  
And I hope I can do for him what he did for me  
  
[Chorus:]  
How would it be?  
Where I am?  
If my father didn't tell me  
To never say I can't  
  
He'd carry me  
And never let me fall  
Oh and the only thing he asked  
Right before he passed  
Was to never say you can't  
  
Oh  
Never say you can't  
Oh  
Never say you can't

[Verse 1]  
Here I am again doing things I said that I wouldn't do  
It's 3 am and I'm rushing out the door to see you  
Waiting all day, but now you want to call me  
Why do you do this to me all the time?  
  
[Chorus]  
After all the things you put me through, still I come right back  
But now I know the truth, I can finally see  
You only want me when you're lonely  
If I say I'm going to leave, that's the only time you want me  
Next time you need me there I won't make it  
Another late night call I won't take it  
Cos now I finally see, you only want me when you're lonely  
Only when you're lonely, lonely  
Only when you're lonely  
Only when you're lonely, lonely  
Only when you're lonely  
  
[Verse 2]  
Had me fooled from the start and I quickly gave my heart  
Because I loved you, loved you  
But this is what happens when you're a lonely girl  
With no one to turn you  
Now I'm stronger, don't need you any longer  
So get off your knees, your words don't mean anything  
  
After all the things you put me through, still I come right back  
But now I know the truth, I can finally see  
You only want me when you're lonely  
If I say I'm going to leave, that's the only time you want me  
Next time you need me there I won't make it  
Another late night call I won't take it  
Because now I finally see, you only want me when you're lonely  
  
Nothing's ever changing, decisions you can't make it  
You just think of yourself and never me at all  
If you're with your friends, you just string me along  
But I won't allow it anymore, so it's time for me to move on  
  
[Chorus]  
Because I can finally see, you only want me when you're lonely  
If I say I'm going to leave, that's the only time you want me  
Next time you need me there I won't make it  
Another late night call I won't take it  
Cos now I finally see, you only want me when you're lonely  
Only when you're lonely, lonely  
Only when you're lonely  
Only when you're lonely, lonely  
Only when you're lonely  
  
[Verse 3]  
I can finally see, you only want me when you're lonely  
If I say I'm going to leave, that's the only time you want me  
Next time you need me there I won't make it  
Another late night call I won't take it  
Because now I finally see, you only want me when you're lonely

Don't it feel good babe, don't it feel good babe  
'Cause it's so brand new babe, it's so brand new babe  
  
Don't it feel good babe, don't it feel good babe  
'Cause it's so brand new babe, it's so brand new babe  
  
And then here we are (here we are), in this big old empty room  
Staring at each other, who's gonna make the first move?  
Been doing our thing for a minute, and now both our hearts are in it  
The only place to go is all the way  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh babe, Is that alright? Is that okay?  
Girl no need to be nervous,  
'Cause I got you all night, don't you worry about a thing no, no, no,  
Just go with it, go with it, go with it  
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it  
It's our first time  
Go with it, go with it, go with it  
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it  
It's our first time  
  
Clothes are not required, for what we got planned  
Ooh, girl your my desire, your wish is my command  
Treat you like a princess, ooh girl your so delicious  
Like ice cream on a sunny day, gonna eat you before you melt away, yeah  
  
Oh babe, Is that alright? Is that okay?  
Girl no need to be nervous, no, no, no,  
'Cause I got you all night, don't you worry about a thing no, no, no,  
Just go with it, go with it, go with it  
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it  
It's our first time  
Go with it, go with it, go with it  
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it  
It's our first time  
  
Don't it feel good babe, don't it feel good babe  
'Cause it's so brand new babe, it's so brand new babe  
  
Don't it feel good babe, don't it feel good babe  
'Cause it's so brand new babe, it's so brand new babe  
  
Just go with it, go with it, go with it  
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it  
It's our first time  
Go with it, go with it, go with it  
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it  
It's our first time

Everyday I wakeup  
Next to an angel  
More beautiful than  
Words can say.  
  
They said it wouldn't work  
But what do they know?  
Cause years have past  
And we're still here today.  
  
Never in my dreams  
Did I think  
That this  
Would happen to me.  
  
As I stand here  
Before my woman  
I can't fight back  
The tears in my eyes.  
  
Oh how could I be so lucky  
I must have done something right.  
And I promise to love her  
For the rest of my life.  
  
It seems like yesterday  
When she first said "Hello"  
Funny how times fly  
When you're in love.  
  
It took us a lifetime  
To find each other  
It was worth the wait  
'Cause I finally found the one.  
  
Never in my dreams  
Did I think  
That this  
Would happen to me.  
  
As I stand here  
Before my woman  
I can't fight back  
The tears in my eyes.  
  
Oh how could I be so lucky  
I must have done something right.  
And I promise to love her  
For the rest of my life.

[Verse 1]  
So easy to forget our love, the little things we do.  
Like callin' for no reason, just to say the words,  
"Baby, I love you."  
I know lately I've been busy, but a second doesn't go by  
Without you crossin' my mind.  
It's been so long since we had time,  
Let's take a day and make everything 'right.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Just take my hand, fall in love with me again.  
  
[Chorus]  
Let's runaway to the place where love first found us.  
Let's runaway for the day, don't need anyone around us.  
When everything in love gets so complicated,  
It only takes a day to change it.  
What I have to say can't wait, all I need is a day,  
So let's runaway.  
Let's runaway, just for the day,  
Runaway, runaway.  
  
[Verse 2]  
Girl, you've been so patient,  
Spendin' nights alone and not complainin'  
But I'll make it up to you and I promise today I won't keep you waitin'.  
Please give me this one chance to remind you of everything we have.  
I won't give up, I'm too much in love, and I want you to know that.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Just take my hand, fall in love with me again.  
  
[Chorus]  
Let's runaway to the place where love first found us.  
Let's runaway for the day, don't need anyone around us.  
When everything in love gets so complicated,  
It only takes a day to change it.  
What I have to say can't wait, all I need is a day,  
  
[Bridge]  
So let's runaway for the day,  
And I'll give everything in this moment.  
And I promise to make everyday just like the day.  
  
[Chorus]  
Let's runaway to the place where love first found us.  
Let's runaway for the day, don't need anyone around us.  
When everything in love gets so complicated,  
It only takes a day to change it.  
What I have to say can't wait, all I need is a day,  
So let's runaway.

Well looky here looky here ah what do we have?  
Another pretty thing ready for me to grab  
But little does she know that I'm a wolf in sheeps clothing  
'Cause at the end of the night it is her I'll be holding

So many eager young bunnies that I'd like to pursue  
Now even though they're eating out the palm of my hand  
There's only one carrot and they all gotta share it

That's what you'll say,  
You'll tell me baby, baby please don't go away  
But when I play, I never stay

She was covered in leather and gold  
Twenty one years old  
I lost her in the cold  
It's unfair, she's out there  
  
Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn  
She's somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn  
  
Little miss perfect sitting at the train stop  
Red Nike high tops listening to hip-hop  
While we were waiting started conversating  
Before I got her name along came a train  
  
(uh) next stop Brooklyn  
(uh) now I'm lookin'  
  
She was covered in leather and gold  
Twenty one years old  
I lost her in the cold  
It's unfair, she's out there  
Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn  
She's somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn  
  
On the street kickin' rocks circling the same block  
Green farm flat bush checking every corner shop  
Tappin' people's shoulders askin' if they know her  
Everyday's the same back to the train  
  
(uh) next stop Brooklyn  
(uh) I'm still lookin'  
  
She was covered in leather and gold  
Twenty one years old  
I lost her in the cold  
It's unfair, she's out there  
Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn  
She's somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn  
  
Oh-oh-oh-oh  
I wonder if we'll ever meet again  
Oh-oh-oh-oh  
I wonder we we'll ever meet again  
Yeah I wonder if we'll meet again  
I hope we do somewhere in Brooklyn

Oh I was perfect  
For the circus  
If she dared me I'd do it  
Love makes you stupid  
I gave it up  
But I guess it was not enough  
'Cause she never seemed satisfied  
  
Oooh I know I'm not perfect  
But at the end of the day  
Who is? Oooh  
She wanted someone that's perfect  
Okay  
But can you tell me who is?  
  
Oooh Ooh Oooh  
Oooh Ooh Oooh  
  
She set the bar  
Just above the stars  
A rocket couldn't reach it  
But I still kept on reachin'  
She watched me try  
At least a thousand time  
If she loved me she'd stop me but no  
  
Oooh I know I'm not perfect  
But at the end of the day  
Who is? Oooh  
She wanted someone that's perfect  
Okay  
But can you tell me who is?  
  
I saw something worth my future  
So wrong, so wrong  
In my mind I was all it took  
But I guess I wasn't wrong  
  
Oooh I know I'm not perfect  
But at the end of the day  
Who is?  
She wanted someone that's perfect  
Okay  
But can you tell me who is?  
  
Oooh Ooh Oooh  
Oooh Ooh Oooh

I spent all my money on a big old fancy car  
For these bright-eyed hunnies  
Oh, yeah, you know who you are  
Keep me up 'til the sun is high  
'Til the birds start calling my name  
I'm addicted and I don't know why  
Guess I've always been this way  
  
All these roads steer me wrong  
But I still drive them all night long, all night long  
  
All you young wild girls  
You make a mess of me  
Yeah, you young wild girls  
You'll be the death of me, the death of me  
All you young wild girls  
No matter what you do (No matter what you do)  
Yeah, you young wild girls  
I'll always come back to you, come back to you  
  
I get lost under these lights  
I get lost in the words I say  
Start believing my own lies  
Like everything will be okay  
Oh, I still dream of simple life  
Boy meets girl, makes her his wife  
But love don't exist  
When you live like this  
That much I know, yes I know  
  
All these roads steer me wrong  
But I still drive them all night long, all night long  
  
All you young wild girls  
You make a mess of me  
Yeah, you young wild girls  
You'll be the death of me, the death of me  
All you young wild girls  
No matter what you do (No matter what you do)  
Yeah, you young wild girls  
I'll always come back to you, come back to you  
  
You, you, you, you  
You, you, you, you  
Yeah, you, you, you  
You, you, you, you  
  
All you young wild girls  
You make a mess of me  
Yeah, you young wild girls  
You'll be the death of me, the death of me  
All you young wild girls  
No matter what you do (No matter what you do)  
Yeah, you young wild girls  
I'll always come back to you, come back to you
