Fearing the day - hiding the light  
My mind is shocked with fever  
Evil will play - night after night  
They are the soul receivers  
  
Yeah, they are strangers in the night  
Yeah, they're endangering your life  
Drinking your tears - embracing your fears  
  
[Chorus:]  
Danger - the lair is hard to find  
Danger - so keep that in your mind  
Ripping me up - tearing me down  
My soul is crying "action!"  
Terror is king but I got the crown  
I'll start a chain reaction  
  
[Bridge]  
Danger - a madness in the air  
Danger - dimensions everywhere  
  
Whispering names on lonely roads  
With eyes camouflaged in shadows  
They stalk the earth in silent packs  
No time to die tomorrow  
  
[Chorus]

He is a man forced to live with the rats  
But he is dying for a smile from you  
He is a man without a home in his life  
Is that a reason to walk on the line  
  
It's like a game - don't mess around  
Don't be a fool so just go on  
  
No life of double standard what he's looking for  
Only a dream of tender delight  
No more a bloody fool in this dirty town  
So get away take your own line  
  
Hard is the game - don't turn around  
You make the rules so hold your ground  
  
He's got a heart of gold  
The brain to realize he leads the better life  
He's got a heart of gold  
So free your mind - live with a smile  
  
Heart of gold - just like a diamond in the rough  
He is dying for a touch from you  
No more a bloody fool in this god damned town  
Please be strong for just one time  
  
So play this game and move the pawns  
It's up to you so just go on  
  
He's got a heart of gold  
The heart to free his soul, the heart to reach the goal  
Sweet little a heart of gold  
So free and fine - live with a smile  
  
Live with a smile on your face  
Hard is the game - don't turn around  
No more a fool so just go on  
  
He's got a heart of gold  
The brain to realize he leads the better life  
He's got a heart of gold  
So free your mind - live with a smile  
  
He's got a heart of gold  
The heart to free his soul, the heart to reach the goal  
Sweet little a heart of gold  
So free and fine - live with a smile  
  
Just live with a smile on your face  
He is dying for a smile from you  
So just go on - go on - go on  
With your heart of gold  
  
Don't turn around  
You make the rules so hold your ground  
Sweet little a heart of gold

They say I won't make it to the top of the hill  
Won't take the fruit of a tree  
And everybody says I'm out for the kill  
  
They're all laughing at me  
They're all laughing at me  
  
I'm a rebel, rebel - don't you just know it  
I'm a rebel, rebel  
And they're all laughing at me  
  
They say I'm a danger to the public and all  
I only wish they would see  
I'm just a product of a screwed-up world, but they're all...  
  
They're all laughing at me  
But they're all laughing at me  
  
I'm a rebel, rebel - don't you just know it  
I'm a rebel, rebel - don't you just know it  
I'm a rebel, rebel  
But they're all laughing at me  
  
Never ever wash my old blue jeans  
And brush the smile off my face  
But still I'm a member of the...  
  
Human race, human race, human race, human race  
I'm a rebel, rebel - don't you just know it  
I'm a rebel, rebel - don't you just know it  
I'm a rebel, rebel - don't you just know it  
I'm a rebel, rebel  
And they're all laughing at me  
I'm a rebel

One electrified eye  
Freezing metalized smile  
No more cheating the code  
The scene is set - emotions disconnected  
  
Welcome to the cyber trail  
Laser cops and sirens wail  
Held down with magnetic force  
Said: come with us - you broke the law  
  
Obey the rules - don't do no wrong  
A thought too loud - and crime is done  
No appeal for the common man  
Just cold hard facts - in computer land  
  
All freedom burns on eternal fire  
There's no more independence day  
Forever gone never have another  
No other independence day  
  
Cyborg arms put the straps around  
One more second 'till the switch comes down  
Flaching lights - a cage of steel  
Turns my head into a dead dogs meal  
  
In this world - robotic rage  
You'll understand the acid pain  
Do no right - you won't last long  
Remote controlled - under the heel of submission  
  
All freedom burns on eternal fire  
There's no more independence day  
Forever gone never have another  
No other independence day  
  
No remorse - for human kind  
No recourse - to keep your mind  
It's too late - there's no escape  
Is this the end of the line  
  
All freedom burns on eternal fire  
There's no more independence day  
Forever gone never have another  
No other independence day  
  
All freedom burns on eternal fire  
There's no more independence day  
Forever gone never have another  
No other independence day  
  
No use for humanity  
We'll never ever be free again  
No tomorrows  
Zero - the number of the year  
Zero - the number of the year

If you need... you need a lover  
Just call seven - six - five - four - three - two - one, one-day lover  
  
If you need, need a two-days lover  
Just call eight - seven - six - five - four - three - two, two-days lover  
  
'Cause the love, the love I will give you  
'Cause the love, the love I will give you  
Is sweeter than anything else  
  
I'm the love machine in town  
The best you can get fifty miles around  
I'm the love machine in town  
The best you can get fifty miles around  
  
If you need... you need a lover  
Just call seven - six - five - four - three - two - one, one-day lover  
  
'Cause the love, the love I will give you  
'Cause the love, the love I will give you  
Is sweeter  
  
I'm the love machine in town

Why are you so frightened - we're getting in the mood  
Body breaking volume - we are loud and rude  
Laser piercing lighting - megasonic sound  
The first day of your lesson - upheaval in the ground  
  
We're forging straight ahead now - it's not a dream  
Never ever lose the power - we're as hard as steel  
Don't you feel the fire - the burning in your soul  
Just come and join the fantasy - it will make you free  
  
So cut the crap out - it's for you  
Feel so damn proud - of this rocking crew  
We'll break the world down - tear up all the rules  
Reality is clear now - the future is for you  
  
So shout it out - just let it out  
So shout it out - as loud as you can  
So shout it out - just let it out  
So shout it out - as loud as we all can  
  
Now's the final showdown - it's time to be released  
Our weapons are so deadly - we're armed up to the teeth  
Electrostatic sound waves - you cannot hide  
Gonna execute our metal shock - straight between the eyes  
  
Shout - shout - shout - shout  
Shout - shout - shout - shout

I've been away from home  
Was outta sight  
No other change has come  
Who let the boredom in  
  
We got our rockin' rights  
We'll overcome  
The mirror never lies  
We'll show 'em how it's done  
  
We always dress in black  
To be unkind  
We always dress in black  
With you in mind  
  
It's the way of life we live, you know where we are coming from  
It's the way of life we live in, and we're not wrong  
'cause it's the way of life we live, you know where we are coming from  
It's the way of life we live in, we are the strong  
  
We never will deceive  
Take no double-talk  
And all the fat cats bull  
Don't like the way we walk  
  
They spit behind our backs  
Unwelcomed class  
But it's way down deep  
They want to be like us  
  
We always dress in black,  
It's the way of life we live,  
Time is ticking by  
For you life is such a lie  
You clipped your wings to fly  
You could have had it all, but!  
  
Work nine to five  
Finish fifty-five  
Only born to die  
You ever been alive?  
  
We always dress in black,  
It's the way of life we live,
