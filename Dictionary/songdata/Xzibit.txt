[Xzibit]  
I was voted most likely to have a psychiatric evaluation  
Let's start the process of elimination  
This dedication is for niggaz with the green buddha  
The bandula, six-shooter to your suit coolers  
Now how this feel? Cold black steel up in your grill  
This hollow point lead gon' be your last meal  
Say your prayers, say your graces  
Pieces of your face is found in a hundred different places  
Huh, so what we lookin like? We tryin to see some hoes to fuck tonight  
and you just tryin to see the afterlife  
Make a decision before we have a head-on collision  
makin me spend the rest of my life in prison  
See I can only play the cards I was given  
Multiplication division whatever you got to break mines off  
like the U.S. government did to Microsoft  
Like Xzibit in some pussy with the lights turned off  
It's like  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm just livin to fulfill my dreams  
I'm just tryin to have the best of things  
None of y'all can't take shit from me  
Life's a bitch she ain't fuckin for free  
So I'ma ride til the wheels fall off  
while all the rest get weak and go soft  
Your petite style, can get you beat down  
My heat's loud, have you huggin on the street now  
  
[Xzibit]  
Niggaz keep askin me how does it feel  
How does WHAT feel? Not havin to scrape for a meal?  
Not bein locked down to a fucked up deal?  
The biggest man in Los Angeles is not Shaquille  
We had to reinvent the wheel, draft new blueprints  
Made a whole album, spent HALF what you spent  
then sent the rest to my people to invest wit it  
Custom fitted, if you want it nigga, come and get it  
and I suggest you bring a million niggaz runnin wit it  
Split it, feel it, hit it it's hot, look  
I ain't gon' stop til everybody's shot  
Muammar Khadaf's the dot, X mark the spot  
with an infrared to your head, left for dead  
Fuck the feds, flee the country then grow some dreads (ya mon)  
I suggest you keep your distance, for instance, the same distance  
it takes to get to the next solar system, motherfucker  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Xzibit]  
Strike one, when a nigga talkin shit with his hands  
Strike two, gettin caught in the wrong place with your pants down  
Strike three, tryin to fuck with the D-O-double-G  
D-are-E, or any of my Alkaholik family  
Huh, Xzibit turn your vital signs to a straight line  
Never seen a dog bite and bark at the same time  
Restless, rugged, never relaxed  
Permanently owe you motherfuckers backs like tax  
Baseball bats and breaks upside of your head  
Homey STILL gettin swoll off water and bread  
I got this, retaliation, for any situation I'm facin  
and leave the stage with a standin ovation, it's like  
  
[Chorus]

featuring Tha Alkaholiks  
  
Xzibit:  
When it comes to shit like this  
I always get it right the first time  
playa haters and snakes  
waitin' for mistakes  
But that's the breaks the highs and lows  
Of the industry  
D.I.T.C. and X to the Z  
Bringin' it live  
Get it crackin' to the third degree  
Xzibit breakin' niggas down like H.I.V.  
We gring rap to your city like B.E.T.  
But still feel California  
Is the place to be, Catashtrophy...  
  
Tash:  
The Alkaholiks is back to fry you  
Xtra crispy  
With the skills that make the plots  
to dis me Xtra risky  
Cause the time it takes to infiltrate  
And stop my forward motion  
California will have broken off  
And fell into the ocean  
Cause i rocked around the world  
With my ill type skill  
Step for real or I'll leave your grill scarred like Seal  
Cause I regulate the sectin where the drinks  
Is gettin blended  
Certifed bartender  
So catch the 40  
When I send it your way  
  
Xzibit:  
Niggas that hustle  
Till the day light break  
Go to county 20 times  
Still can't go straight  
Don't nothin in the mothafuckin'  
World come free  
I'll never see a nine to five  
Cause it just ain't me  
(It's like this)  
Xzibit shall hustle, lift build muscle  
And think like Russell  
Survive and bring it live and direct  
To any crowd through out the world  
Like this come home  
And smoke a spliff in the benz  
With Swift  
  
Chorus(2 Times)  
  
Xzibit:  
I'm fucked up J-Ro  
  
J-Ro:  
Yo i'm fucked up to  
Lookin' at these bitches  
From a birds eye view  
My name is J-Ro from tthe Likwit Crew  
  
Hurricane G:  
So what nigga is it you want to do  
  
J-Ro:  
My flow is metaphorical  
Historicly correct  
What do you expect from a nigga  
With my intellect  
East coast representing West coast gangsta  
New I ain't trippin'  
I call up King Tee we go dippin'  
Through the streets  
Pumpin' hard core Likwit beats  
Flowin' air blowin' loungin'  
Inn them leather seats  
Think gback how we used to rock the house party  
Now we just fuckin' it up for everybody  
  
Xzibit:  
How dare you try to compare  
Yourself to the original  
Professional Xzibit break you down  
Like correctional Facilitys  
Limit all capabilities muthafuck MC's  
Hard to read like Japanese  
I'm spreading like disease  
So I can't be stopped  
By who you run with your click  
Or the Btich ass cops  
Xzibits' first LP  
It hit your black like crack rock  
I'm blowin' up your spot by remote  
Mr. Cut Throat  
  
J-Ro:  
I"m from Cystal-ifornia  
I warned ya I'd be on ya  
The Ro is outer national  
Cold as Henne-sota  
I smoke 12 MC's a day  
Just to fill my quota  
From forty 0-hio  
All the way to Ore-gin  
Buddy my fingers are bloody Now I'm Washing-ten  
I clown from Brew-york  
Down to Mi-ti-ami  
I soak up game like a shammy  
Understand me?  
  
Hook  
  
Tash:  
So Elizabeth it's MC's  
That's comin' to join ya  
Some will be from NYC And some will be from California  
Cause I drop the lyrics on you  
From beneath the Earth's surface  
Where I write rhymes so fresh  
I try to bite my own verses  
Cause the purpose of my flow  
Is to let you know  
My style is badder than the water  
Down in Mexico  
Cause RICO blend styles like juice and gin  
I got the Likwit shit  
That have you seein' double  
Like the Twins

[Xzibit]  
Last but not least we off the leash  
The Art of War reach for your masterpiece  
Feel the release from the phantom bangs you  
Snatched off put you in a frame and hang you  
Comin at you niggas from a different angle  
Arch Angel choke hold and strangled

Throw you off the bridge and watch you drown

Pop up some where in Mexico

Justine, 19, just got clean  
Fresh outta rehab with self-esteem  
She ain't felt this good in a while  
A new leash on life, a vibrant thang, a beautiful smile  
Used to run with a circle of friends, who was skeleton thin  
Sniff white lines off powerful men  
But see, all that's a thang of the past, she got class  
And be damned if she'd let herself burn and crash  
She ain't from money so she startin from scratch  
It's hard working for scraps  
It take everything she got not to relaspe  
Locked down in 9 to 5, but at the 9 to 5  
She get sexually harassed and chastised  
Boss is a married man, she won't touch him  
Frustrated angry man, she won't fuck him  
She's out of her job, at Basket Cakes  
Least it came wit an 8, 2 lines to the face  
God Damn!  
  
[Chorus]  
It's a cold, cold, world, and you know it  
Niggaz will lay you down and take your bread, yeah and you know it  
Only two choices, you can give it up or you can just die with it!  
Only two choices, you can give it up or you can just die with it, yeah  
  
He was on his own, at a very young age  
When he learned from the streets, made everything change  
See he came up with hustlers, lost his religion  
It's funny how money can make a nigga think he livin  
I ain't talkin paper like Jigga or Dre  
It's more like 7500, 9 ounces of lle'  
That's what he say he can get for the flip, they thought the deal was legit  
But he stuck him and split, in deep shit  
Now his mother work for minimum pay  
Live a positive way, she the first one at church every Sunday  
Blind to the needs of her son, he's a gatling gun  
In the streets, jackin niggaz for fun  
It's a non-stop search through the hood, but can't catch him  
They found out where mom stayed and went steppin  
The evil that men do, but still we continue  
With death and dishonor, for the all mighty dollar, it's so cold  
  
[Chorus]  
  
He was 13, brought up in Baghdad  
Ate with his right and made money with his left hand  
Prayed to the East, 5 times daily  
His mother and father just had a new born baby  
Now his father was an Imam who carried the weight  
And built his family on 5 pillars of faith  
Never trippin off Western ways, it meant nada  
Pilgramige to Mecca to circle around Kabba  
300 miles away, British troops hit Basra  
His cousin waged jihad and died with honor  
He heard about the buildings on 9-11  
And a man named Bush on a search for weapons  
Now here come the U.S., to crush Saddam  
Wit 88 thousand tons of missile and bombs  
But his family's too broke to move or find shelter  
If they all had to die, they would die together and that's cold... damn  
  
[Chorus]

Yeah so it all comes down to this (what?)  
Specialist with a hit list  
Right fist bomb type M.G.M. fight night type (ding ding)  
So when I hits in the stage we can Face Off  
Watch me rattle your Nicholas Cage  
Bring heat in ridiculous ways never compromise  
Look into my eyes tell me what you see (what?)  
Victory ecstasy maybe Hennessy  
Energy wasted, enemies gettin' laced with  
That point blank to the face shit  
Who you think this is  
Young black bust a nigga ass strictly business man  
Self disciple Heineken let the record spin  
Paparazzi all over again, times ten  
Like thee original sin  
I'm tryin' to fuck it up for everybody  
The hot ? get collect calls from John Gotti  
I kick back like karate  
Butter soft burn off and solid black Mazaratti like  
  
Get caught up in the game (it gets deeper then that)  
No gain with no pain (it gets deeper then that)  
Dyin' in the fast lane (way deeper then that)  
To the place where the motherfuckin' problem is at  
  
Long hair ganja smoke but don't be mistaken  
I ain't Jamacian  
Find another chick to jerk  
A world of hurt 9 to 5 puttin' in work  
Never rest put to the test get put to the death  
Never the less only greater than  
Trust no man  
Soon to have the whole wide world inside of my hand  
So I suggest you act right my insight like sunlight  
Burn your cornea  
Big bad California  
To the Waldord Historia (c'mon)  
N.Y.C. competition wish to some day roll like me  
But all I see is capital H-E-A-T  
I'm makin' motherfuckers Run like DMC (run)  
The Likwit MC is here to blaze a nigga like a fat one  
Non radio bangin' shit goin' platinum  
And keep slappin' 'em with a Colt 45  
While my Old English leave you broken down with a Crooked Ise (eye)  
  
Get caught up in the game (it gets deeper then that)  
No gain with no pain (it gets deeper then that)  
Dyin' in the fast lane (way deeper then that)  
To the place where the motherfuckin' problem is at  
  
Suck it easy Movin' On Up like George and Weezy  
You can't stop it love it or leave it alone  
Xzibit writtin' more pages then the state penetentary  
Full of well known villians that want to come home  
Never relax ain't no tellin' lay it on wax  
Make it bang let Stever sell 'em and dip 'em in chrome  
My nigga Bud'da chip off beats like cellular phones  
Heir to the thrown  
Xzibit bring the lead to your dome  
Like a 3rd world rebellion squad on your boulevard  
Protect they spots with heat  
They kids ggotta eat to make it big in Cali it depends on who you meet  
And who you sleep with  
Might find yourself in deep shit  
So hit me with your best shot  
I'm lookin' forward to it  
You shouldn't repeat it if you ain't really goin' through it  
How dare you try to check the fluid  
Rip the track chillin' on your big plans like Wilsure and Farefax  
  
Get caught up in the game (it gets deeper then that)  
No gain with no pain (it gets deeper then that)  
Dyin' in the fast lane (way deeper then that)  
To the place where the motherfuckin' problem is at

1989 the number another summer (Get down)  
Sound of the fucking drummer  
Music hitting your heart cause I know you got soul (Brothers and sisters)  
Listen if you're missing y'all  
Swinging while I'm singing  
Giving whatcha getting  
Knowing what I know  
While the Black bands sweating  
And the rhythm rhymes rolling  
Got to give us what we want  
Gotta give us what we need  
Our freedom of speech is freedom or death  
We got to fight the powers that be  
  
Let me hear you say

As the rhythm designed to bounce  
What counts is that the rhymes  
Designed to fill your mind  
Now that you've realized the prides arrived  
We got to pump the stuff to make us tough  
From the heart  
It's a start, a work of art  
To revolutionize make a change nothing's strange  
People, people we are the same  
No we're not the same  
'Cause we don't know the game  
What we need is awareness, we can't get careless  
You say what is this?  
My beloved lets get down to business  
Mental self defensive fitness  
Bum rush the show  
You gotta go for what you know  
Make everybody see, in order to fight the powers that be

Elvis was a hero to most  
But he never meant shit to me you see  
Straight up racist that sucker was  
Simple and plain  
Motherfuck him and John Wayne  
'Cause I'm Black and I'm proud  
I'm ready and hyped plus I'm amped  
Most of my heroes don't appear on no stamps  
Sample a look back you look and find  
Nothing but rednecks for 400 years if you check  
Don't worry be happy  
Was a number one jam  
Damn if I say it you can slap me right here  
Let's get this party started right (Right on, come on)  
What we got to say  
Power to the people no delay  
To make everybody see  
In order to fight the powers that be  
  
Let me hear you say  
Fight the power  
Fight the power

You gotta fight the powers that be  
Let me hear you say

Witness the downfall of men  
I wanna kill you for your land, I don't mean to kill the reactor  
Linking in Japan, I am here, got the gangsta for all your chain chains  
March to the heart beat of the city  
You only hear the drums when they audace and they see me  
You know what time it is? Flavor with a thousand checks  
It's like the ice ring surrounds my neck  
I never worry about the referee, the gate keepers keep him locked for me  
Push all to shallow, forever  
Always will be underground X to the motherfucker Z  
Fold it all for the money, can't team, where my gangstars at?  
Hit the park, build at the car scene, blowing red everywhere  
Look how strong we are  
So there will be no war or shots  
I'm about to give my city boiling hot and make 'em pray for real  
And make 'em say my name, lit up more smoke than a power water drill  
Concentration, determination  
The very thin line between paradise and incarceration  
  
[Chorus]  
Gangsters, gangsters  
Gangsters, stand up and rap what you're claiming  
Police roll around, shake us down, always playing and I  
Gangsters, gangsters  
Streets made me into this man, gotta represent who I am  
  
They say right before you day you get the irry feeling of peace  
Then walk into the light  
My soul want me take it without a fight  
She says she wanna spend the whole life  
But she only got me here for one night  
Said it's time, better get it in. Call your best friend  
I'm a call you wonder-twins  
Stop and go like red light traffic, innovation made it another classic  
We made it happen  
And big hip hop want us gut cut  
Niggas dare too much than offense popped up  
Another game fucked up, because the lanes clocked up  
But the content sucks  
I wanna fill up some big red trucks, tour then through  
The whole world, motherfuckers lining up  
'Cause these tickets won't move like crap  
You're tying west coast around my back  
And y'all niggas saying fuck it with that  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Can't even rely on your own eyes, everything fake now  
Toast to the bad guys  
That will leave a whole class swimming with the fishes  
Part machine, part skill, part intuition  
I cooked my first album in my father's kitchen  
He told me how to make a living, twenty grand and half a chicken  
Now I'm shitting on myself and still I let him know  
That if he turn me in a turn around, it kill us both  
This is a cold world, but I'm a polar bear  
Destroy the earth like a silver flare, best beware of us  
In God we trust, but everybody else gotta pay cash up front  
Caught there, they try to tear me down  
I'm on a level now, I speak like I mean it, the focus study my literature  
Clean house, taking out the trash. I'm in the fly zone  
Where you past, gangsta?  
  
[Chorus]

[Xzibit]  
(Yeah) I can drink a whole Henessey fifth  
Some call that a problem but I call it a gift  
Xzibit make the whole continent shift (hell yeah)  
Invadin your territory in a blaze of glory  
A soldier story, livin off nothin but instinct  
Bitch niggaz continue to floss and lip-sync  
And I'ma just continue to flow, while rockin the boat  
Probably smoke three-hundred thousand dollars in dope  
Don't make my desert eagle barrel touch the back of your throat  
Always approach niggaz that's known for killin your folks  
Be surprised who could turn around and bust on y'all  
Catch your mother or your sister comin out of the mall  
Bang holes through they coats and they Macy bags  
No retaliation you basically runnin with fags  
In these streets, you only good as your last transaction  
Funny style, and these niggaz ain't laughin  
y'all got it all fucked up in zero-zero  
Think life is a video for "Last Action Heroes"  
Face the price you pay for the games you play  
When it's all said and done at the end of the day, you gotta  
  
[Chorus - repeat 2X]  
Get your walk on, get your head right  
I know you feelin the shit, shit is dead right  
Get your bounce on, back dat ass up  
Bitch pass me the bottle, fill your glass up  
  
[Xzibit]  
Judge and jury, don't get your case dismissed  
When I get pissed and smash through the makeshift  
Uplift, dump this, make your shit knock  
Hypnotical hardrock that don't flop  
It's the best thing crackin my nigga  
Lot of rappers talk of flashin the trigger but don't ever deliver  
From the home of the toe tag, lowriders and body bags  
earthquakes police with automatics and nerve gas  
Learn fast or get left behind quick (yeah)  
You testify, you get wrapped in plastic (hell yeah)  
Xzibit turn your SUV into a casket  
Melt your body parts in a tub full of sulfuric acid  
Drastic measures we take just to get by  
for all the shit you gotta go through to get high  
Stand by, do or die for the West coast  
want to fuck with Xzibit but can't come close motherfuckers  
  
[Chorus - repeat 2X]  
Get your walk on, get your head tight  
I know you feelin the shit, the shit is dead right  
Get your bounce on, back dat ass up  
Bitch pass me the bottle, fill your glass up  
  
[Xzibit]  
Tell y'all people to call my people  
Recognize all men are not created equal  
I'm lethal, all y'all faggots remain see-through  
Only the kid from "The Sixth Sense" can peep you (DEAD PEOPLE!)  
When I get through the world'll be a better place  
A little Jesus Christ mixed with some Leatherface  
Go find some punch to spike, find some dope to lace  
Pull a pistol from my waist, nigga reach for space  
Smack the taste out of your mouth if you talk shit  
or hit so hard to the chin it make your back flip  
My transcript number one up in this conference  
It's nonsense, all y'all niggaz want is conflict  
Only associate with pros and the convicts  
Xzibit roll up in the spot with a bomb bitch  
and then bounce with a couple, motherfuck a tussle  
You never have enough muscle to stop a nigga hustle  
  
[Chorus - repeat 4X]  
Get your walk on, get your head tight  
I know you feelin the shit, the shit is dead right  
Get your bounce on, back dat ass up  
Bitch pass me the bottle, fill your glass up

Six train Chevrolet rolln' without no top

You wanted to party, but I got biz  
This ain't entertainin, I'm feedin my kids  
On a 4-oh-5 in the car pool lane  
Got to hit some corners, I'm ridin the cane  
Wanna ride out to a island, and tan your frame  
And just waste away a couple of days,  
Holla back at me!  
Look where I rap, make the crowd get loud like the sound of a gat  
LA on my baseball hat, where they wanna ride up on you in that black on black  
Move, betta, bounce like a mother  
When brother got mass weapons of war with each other  
X getting big, not ready to die yet, my militant mindset  
Got you runnin for cover

Wanna see you in somethin little, walk around the plane  
I got a lot to gain, getting my record off the ground  
Like David Blaine  
So now, what you know bout me?, I'm a self-made man from poverty  
Now I own a lot of property  
I pimp rides, lifestyles, and companies  
Now let me spit you the facts

Baby girl touchin my chain, now let me tell you who I ain't  
Bitch you can't run no games, (A gangsta baby, ain't nothing changed)

This is the long drop method it was supposed to be more humane  
Measure your height and your weight to break your neck with your hand  
Sometimes they use a shore drop or they use a crane  
Either way the victim dies in agonizing pain  
But if the calculations ain't correct when the rope's set  
The rope will rip the head right off the motherfucker's neck  
My appointment at the gallows x emerging from the shadows  
With a vendetta beetle who wanna battle  
Man you gon' get whipped in flaw shackle to an A-frame  
Beaten full force until you can't repeat your own name  
Till you smell the smell of burn and flesh  
Keep you alive until you pray for death  
Drawn in the corner disembowel until there's nothing left  
Saudi Arabia amputation for petty death  
Li chin translated this the leader in death  
A rubber tie filled with gas around your arms and chest  
Set you on fire turn your body to a melted mess  
Ask the AT about the south African necklace  
Go ahead and pick your poison it was coming to you  
Call me the prison bull I came to fucking kill you  
  
[Hook]  
  
Have must I come through merciless  
Be quick with that bullshit you heard of  
Uncut mole what have we ride through  
And always remember that death will come off swift wings  
Anyone who run contested now know have we now picked you whatever  
I came to peel  
  
Hands behind your back shackled then I forced you to kneel  
Shoot you in the back of the head send your family the bill  
For what the bullets cost I'm on my China shit  
Eye for an eye waterboard you like my government  
Impaled and left at the front gates  
Used to hear the sound of broken arms rib and leg makes  
Whipping and pull apart call it the breaking wheel  
By inquisition espanish mi corazon is free  
No compassion don't expect it when I fucking see you  
Lethal injections is my profession loading up my needles  
My iron maiden the Caucasian the Asian  
The information received by the ancient art of persuasion  
I'm 'bout to drop like a guillotine  
The cut is quick and clean I promise you won't feel a thing  
I'll never kiss the ring  
I rather storm the castle kill the king then set fire to fucking everything

[Xzibit]  
I look you in the grill  
And I laugh inside  
Niggas always perpetratin  
Like they down to ride  
But please don't try to tell me  
What I can not see  
What's the real definiton  
Of A Fake MC  
[J-Ro]  
Muthafuckas only rappin since 93  
And expect all props  
[Xzibit]  
Them gettin dropped like hot rocks  
"So stop what you doin cause I'm  
About to ruin".....  
Like Shock-G get turned to stone  
Tryin to rock me  
I separate my thought process  
From stress, 24 tracks inside my brain  
Tyrin to maintain  
I bang shit without no gang or jherri curls  
I seem like Kadeem  
In a whole different world  
It's the girls the cars niggas lose themselves  
Forgettin who they are  
When they try to be that superstar  
They don't understand  
It's all in the game plan  
Exploit the art  
And watch Hip-Hop fall apart  
But I'm a do my part, and stay true  
And keep breakin down bitch niggas like you  
  
HOOK  
[Hurrincane Gee]  
I'm not the type  
To play games or drop  
Name I just maintain  
And burn rappers out the frame  
Doin my part to stay true  
And keep breakin down  
Bitch niggas like you  
  
[Xzibit]  
But above all else  
I represent it for myself  
Leavin muthafuckas stretched out  
Or better yet X-ed out  
Xzibit, Excelerate, I rush it to the extreme  
Like nicotine, never get me clean  
From your blood stream  
We all can't bust, so do it how you must  
But if you hustle, avoid gettin rushed  
With hand cuffs plus  
In got we trust but don't trust us, we just  
Add to the ashes, then pick up the dust  
Like that  
[J-Ro]  
I make it seem  
Like you havin bad dreams  
Have you wakin up out your sleep  
By your own screams  
Xzibit has arrived Goddamit  
[Xzibit]  
We bout to rock the whole planet  
And bitch niggas can't stand it  
Try to play the back and look intense  
You need to hit a fence  
You don't want none of this  
Hands on experience  
I'm no the type to play games  
Or drop names I just  
Maintain and drop rappers out the frame  
[Hurricane Gee]  
I bring it to the ruffest toughest  
Mic killers  
And you want to be niggas  
And you burn bithces, type vicious  
Imitating Hurricane flow for riches  
You don't know the half  
I got the ill vocab double rap style  
Gettin bucked  
More freaky than your last good fuck  
Milkin you like ba ba pieces  
Meetin niggas lyrical wishes  
Writin rhymes and washin out dishes  
Flowin with the likwid wicked  
Representin with my nigga Xzibit  
And we gonna do it  
And do it and do it  
Til you satisfied! cause shit is tight  
Bodiqua C.E.O. on the mic  
Smashin and trashin  
Fuck Moschino fashion  
All you muthafuckas need to stop askin  
Valued more than the chrome  
On your last set of wheels  
Hurricane here to reign on your brain  
Just maintain

[Chorus]  
I'm sorry I met you  
I'm sorry I hurt you  
I'm sorry I killed you  
I'm sorry I murked you  
Because I'm all alone now nobody is with me  
Nobody to threaten that they about come get me  
I wish I could go back to where we began  
I wish you was alive so I could kill you again  
I wish we had more paths to cross  
Nobody even cares if they survive my loss  
My killer's remorse  
  
For me we are the same should be laughed at  
Could be the very fame shit to get your bitch ass clacked  
You fell slick next now drowning in your own pool out back  
I kick the cats and dog tube the shit I don't count that  
You're my angel of death I strangle till there's no breath  
I kill the kill kill till there ain't nobody left  
My conscience don't inhibit me I kill deliberately  
Just wanna be like God, cause God kills indiscriminately  
I'm so christian I'm so muslim  
Super size on your mom trigger get push up  
I'm parallel to hell I'm ready so Satan what's cooking  
And rappers running their mouth they don't know how close their bitch ass is
coked  
To get turned in ghosts nigga I will kill you  
Don't get it cross memories fade just as blood washes off  
I said memories fade just as blood washes off  
Hope to see you soon  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I feel so guilty my hands are filthy  
From decorating your face all over the building  
I'm staying sincere if I ain't making it clear  
I'm writing on the wall with the blood man I wished you were here  
But you moved on at your funeral I beat you with slam  
I hugged your mom tell your sister and her kids to be clam  
I will tell 'em you gone you just sleep in a dream and all c'est la vie  
We smoked you like the weed in the bong  
  
Have you ever seen the bloodstain  
And know that person has returned from every once came  
Regret is such an ugly thing only if you let it fuck with your brain  
But it ain't gonna change a fucking thing  
What's done is done chop that shit up to the game  
You're still dead when I'm still alive  
And I never got the chance to utilize my best alibi  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Started the bullshit escalated to violence  
In result of the violence infinite permanent silence  
Now I feel empty not even existing  
My worst enemy is no longer against me  
I remember the hatred and how it consumed me  
And you felt the same thing but never could move me  
A shot to the face is nothing like in the movies  
The back of your brain is out the body keeps moving  
So I should rejoice now because you are past tense  
The last of my enemies the last of you bastards  
The dirt on your casket  
I'm so alone now you were the reason to carry my danger my chrome out  
And I just sold out and wait for the contact  
And life for the combat and now we be on that  
And I'd take it all back if I knew what I knew now  
What's a shooter without somebody to shoot down  
  
[Chorus]

Yeah.. huh.. it's been a long time  
It seem like the whole world waitin on the West coast  
We missed you.. welcome back - let's go!  
  
Uhh, yeah that, new West  
Yes  
c'mon, uhh  
Uhh  
Here we go - Steady gang, Steady gang, Steady gang, Steady gang  
Uhh, yeah that  
Yes  
Klack, klack - klack-klack-klack-klack-klack-klack, uhh c'mon  
Yeah, uhh  
YEAH! YEAH!!!  
  
Strong Arm Steady we ready it's time to ball out  
When vocal chords spit cold shit they never thaw out  
Industry tried to pigeonhole, I had to crawl out  
Hear my name bein called out, nuclear fallout  
Full body armor with bangers, we goin all out  
Garbage bags in trunk of the car, it won't stall out  
Hit you where you stay, hogtied, you gettin hauled out  
Crush the whole car, it's well planned and thought out  
Try to attain fame from beef, you went the wrong route  
Scrape a 38 on your teeth, I knock 'em all out  
I know you ain't fuckin with me dawg (c'mon NOW)  
Underestimate, run up on, it's on now  
Have your niggaz plottin revenge and puttin songs out  
Demise by design, blueprints is drawn out  
Flood crack back in the hood, it's been a long drought  
Show you what this gangster killa Cali is all about  
  
[Chorus - repeat 2X]  
KLACK - for the niggaz that bang in the inner city and  
KLACK - for the enemies creepin to come and get me  
Be thankful, if you get away alive  
You wouldn't kill or won't let nothin die, so keep it movin  
  
[Xzibit]  
Yo! You don't like how I'm livin well FUCK YOU  
Nastradamus style, make every line come through  
Don't make me spit predict your last action  
Last man standin (yeah) last man laughin (yeah)  
Assassin, crosshairs, smile for the birdie (CLICK!)  
Hit you long range, high powered, 30-30 shit  
If you never heard of a heavy assault rifle  
Hit targets a mile away from the top of the Eiffel (woo!)  
Knock the soul out of your body, stay plottin like Bin Laden  
to swoop down and crash your party  
All bark no bite (SHIIIT!) we don't bark nigga  
We bite to the white then shake 'til the afterlife  
Hard work and sacrifice, who's your daddy?  
Make you want to drop e'rything and move to Cali  
We classic, go 'head, speak my name  
And I'ma lay your ass down like the All Star game, c'mon  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[possibly Strong Arm - uncredited]  
Sawed-off shotgun, shoot through your shoulderblade  
Bitch-made niggaz get, hit with a hand grenade  
Blow up your Escalade, then I hit the road  
and I'm back in the hood lookin for somethin to smoke  
Everytime, I use the element of surprise  
With a gun that's big enough to make an elephant hide  
I elevate my rhythm by hustlin crack addicts  
Get locked but, when I'm released I'm back at it  
See, Mitch know the time, in front of me the birdie and  
Phil got the customers comin to get it early we  
came a long way from po-lice chasin us  
for dope in our socks and angel dust  
Yeah klack for the strippers in clubs shakin they titties  
This, mac'll have you bitch niggaz runnin like P. Diddy  
I'll bang you, comin out the side of your mouth  
We the reason why you stay in the house, Stizzle, Gang  
  
[Chorus]

You think you ready for them steady niggaz? I can't tell  
Sex sells so fuck you all, we came to bubble and ball  
You getting shutd own soon as I touch down  
Bust rounds, enemies slayed and cut down  
Fully automatic spittin rounds with no sound  
Break down your whole regime, like an M-16  
Make sure the chamber in the barrel is clean  
And the spring that's connected to the firin pin  
That's connected to the trigger when I squeeze it again, begin  
  
Look ma top of the world, the best of the best  
King California, L-A-X  
Out the hood, in the penthouse, from the projects  
One man, one gun, how the West was won - sing!

Somebody gon' make me break the law  
But I ain't waitin, there's no escapin

You better get ready for the war  
  
Hit like a heavyweight, breathe deep, meditate  
Make the whole crowd get loud, make 'em levitate  
I ride through my city like a presidential candidate  
L-A-X, Phantom double-are, and accelerate  
Stack build elevate, crash through the prison gate  
Generation hate, appetite to eliminate  
X-Man don't spit rhymes, I ventilate  
Traffic contraband, yeah banned through the interstate  
Got a sick flow - didn't know? Let me demonstrate  
Renovate the game, new nigga that you love to hate  
The left hand lands and the right hand devastates  
Half part of your face replaced with a metal plate  
Irate, get snatched to a better place  
Let the detached decorate with the yellow tape  
Detonate, drop bombs, make the earth shake  
In Brazil with a half mill' in the briefcase  
  
Look ma top of the world, the best of the best  
King California, L-A-X  
Out the hood, in the penthouse, from the projects  
One man, one gun, how the West was won - sing!  
  
It's so frustratin, so many hatin  
Somebody gon' make me break the law  
But I ain't waitin, there's no escapin  
You better get ready for the war  
  
It's so frustratin, so many hatin  
Somebody gon' make me break the law  
But I ain't waitin, there's no escapin  
You better get ready for the war  
  
You better get ready for the war

Danger danger, wild west ranger ranger  
Rearrange 'a the mark ass stranger  
Behold, the look on my face stone cold  
With a rare cowboy style that never grow old  
  
I'm the Golden State bear with a rough flare, plus debanare  
Time for me and mine, but for any kind I can't care  
Stormy weather rain liquid  
Defari con Tony Toca, Tash, and Xzibit  
  
Break necks bounce with it when I spit it  
Knockin this jam is a form of calastenics  
Let it knock when you mashin down the block  
Rims spank with the car wash  
  
Watch the bitches stop  
An look, always stay five steps ahead  
Hard at work, while you tricks lay in bed  
Dead to the world but ?Hayru? he be the sun  
  
Always burnin, 'Cause my job is never done  
Run from one time I rather dump an AK  
that's for all the black and brown that got carried away  
To the morg, when I look in the mirror I see the Lord

Try to reply, don't touch what you ain't gon' buy  
I ain't gon' lie, motherfucker love to get high  
Barely get by with scraps and pennies

If you saw you walking on a street and a  
black man were comin' torward you

Interviewer:  
Well let me ask you this...  
  
"I don't want niggas soundin' like me" -Ghostface Killah on 'Shark Niggas  
(Biters)'  
"I don't want niggas soundin' like me knowhatI'msayin'?" (x2)  
  
Xzibit:  
Yo we gettiin' restless me and D.O.G.s  
Never pretendin' rather we sendin' a very clear message  
Either you with me or against me punk hit 'em up  
Provide housin' for these shrimp from the shells we dump  
I'm makin' 'em bounce other niggas fail to bump  
Til we takin' advantage of inflicting irreversable damage  
It's the long awaited anticipated Likwit MC  
Bombin' first cause I feel it's better to give then receive  
You better believe  
Xzibit stays savage above the average  
When niggas try to switch turn bitch for the cabbage  
But see all that irrelevant it's like tryin' to turn a whore celibate  
I dance with the devil for the hell of it  
Burning down your lavish lanndscape on digital tape  
Cause everything you rhymin' about is actually fake  
So make room for the legitimate nasty inconsiderate  
Thinkin' you rankin' top dollar but really counterfeit  
  
Hook  
  
Montageone:  
Niggas we null and void I get swole like a keyloid  
To overload your system with rhymes for millenniums  
To shut down artists with beats the deep closure  
Battlin' top rank for bank and exposure  
So open up your door to me Cause if it's closed  
I'm a brakin' in with some pantyhose  
Over the mic  
So you don't know who I sound like  
Executing those who record and bite to sound tight  
It's not permitted by the right  
The Gustopo surprising these niggas like Benny Blanco  
Remember me man? You thought I was a fan till I threw you in the back of a  
van  
Yo these Drop Squad delegates rhymes are delicate  
I spit on the mic to get these MC's pussys wet  
For those with plans to clone me thee original  
It can't be done I'm digital (digital)  
  
Hook  
  
Xzibit:  
Yo who want to come see the hard rock?  
The non stop green block yo whole block receive speed knot  
You need not  
Get brave my bullets never graze  
They hit close to home separating flesh from bone  
So better get off on your own bitch  
Rollin' chrome shit tryin't to own shit  
I was molded, after the best that the streets had to offer  
The author of my own destiny  
So I suggest you stop stressin' me  
I'll find out when I pull my nine out and blow your mind out  
Play a deadly game with no fouls and no time outs  
Inhale large amounts of dojah forever ready like a soldier  
I'm lock mode and shoot from the shoulder  
And burn down your lavish landscape digital tape  
Cause everything you rhyme about is actually fake  
So make room for the legitimate nasty inconsiderate  
Thinkin' you rankin' top dollar but really counterfeit  
  
Hook  
  
"I don't want niggas soundin' like me. On no album"

There's no escape from the ones who harassin'  
The reason for the illin' is the reason for askin'  
Now I try to school 'em on the killin' and blastin'  
But season after season they recycle assassins now  
  
He's too advanced for his own good  
He didn't get a second chance to see the glock pointed at his hood  
Makin' his way through the rain he's caught in the game  
He felt the pain of a slug to the back of the brain  
Nothin's changed in a city flask  
Where niggas lurk in black shirts pants and low hats, forever  
Until the job is done and no one's left  
My man Jeff told me with his very last breath  
To watch moms  
But they got her with the car bomb  
Pop tried to save her second blast got his arm  
Niggas play for keeps like casino  
Baby's has got fathers just got back from doin' Chino  
With nothin' to lose loose screws in the attic  
The only skill a nigga knows is how to strip an automatic  
And stash the barrel stab a nigga something terrible  
Death resume 20 kill in incredible time  
No guilt and shame  
On the mind stuck a nigga for lookin' didn't know he was blind  
So I find  
Mankind is a serious threat  
To another others kind when there's something to get  
In a vet gonna fast jet to the spot to see what they got  
Nobody saw shit cause it's not  
Cool to brake the rule of the code of the streets  
Niggas frightened by the visions of the blood on the sheets  
And it's deep how blood drys as a mother crys  
Open eyes gettin' landed on by flys  
There's no disgues for the ones who harassin'  
The reason for the illin' is the reason for askin' now  
  
There's no escape from the ones who harassin'  
The reason for the illin' is the reason for askin'  
Now I try to school 'em on the killin' and blastin'  
But season after season they recycle assassins now  
  
I came from a family of one girl and three boys  
Fuck playin' with toys our fun was on the block  
Watchin' all the cats negotate the neighborhood stock  
My job was to come runnin' whenever cops was comin'  
My older brother I figure was the ring leader  
Whenever these cats move they all bring heaters  
All black and nickel plated (c'mon)  
Soon became fasinated bitches cars and kicks  
And look at how fast they made it  
My younger brother gave less than a fuck he was content  
With G.I. Joe and Tonka trucks  
But I want butts, livin' first class delux  
15 years old soldier ready to serve these clucks  
My older brother was touched  
It's a game where you don't play gotta have cane  
Crack house for my birthday  
The next day my brother shot in cold blood by the police  
In a rage he lived but he payed the price  
Caught with keys 25 to life  
Takin' in by the crew time to standed on my own two (c'mon nigga)  
But as I marinated thinkin' about the hood  
I really can't remember my body doin' good  
For long big decisions somebody got to make 'em  
Undercover recognize the face now can't shake a  
Phone tap (what) and now I'm in the belly of the beast  
Use to sittin' in leather sheets now I'm sittin' awaitin' release  
Visitors day, my younger brother came down  
Put the toys down excited about the first round  
He bust I was crushed to finally see  
The solution to the problem could of started with me  
It's on now  
  
There's no escape from the ones who harassin'  
The reason for the illin' is the reason for askin'  
Now I try to school 'em on the killin' and blastin'  
But season after season they recycle assassins now

Yeah, ha  
Ladies and gentlemen (Ha, Yeah)  
You got money and then bitches  
Power..  
  
Ya had it, ya lost it  
Ya leased it, ya flossed it  
Business fell through now ya comin up off it  
He bought it, he rolled it  
He passed it, you smoked it  
Now ya fucked up off some weed mixed wit coke shit  
Ya love her, ya hate her  
Ya fucked her, ya raped her  
Twenty-five to life 'cause ya can't control ya anger  
Its heavy, its deep  
Its solid, its weak  
Things people say about ya records in the streets (Check it)  
Be careful what ya wish for  
Ya fuck around and get it  
I did it got in it  
Spit it and didn't waste a minute  
So where my niggas at?  
What part of the game is that?  
I paid my dues now nobody tryin to pay me back  
And if they did i would probably have as much as shaq  
My life is the movie so listen to the soundtrack  
This what its all about  
You better stall me out  
And feel the aim of the name you niggas callin out  
  
[Chorus]  
If you feelin how I'm feelin  
And you ready and willin  
to come to the table  
I put it together who doin it better  
Come bounce with me (Come on)  
You can smoke a whole ounce with me (Right on!)  
Take em out!  
If you movin how I'm movin  
And you chosen and proven  
So lose the illusion  
The top guns cue the confusion  
Come bounce with me (Come on!)  
You can smoke a whole ounce with me (Right on!)  
Take em out!  
  
I'm tired, I'm hungry  
You're lazy, disgusting  
You're lay around my house and ya never do nothing  
I seen it, believed it  
Planned it, conceived it  
Missed me with the bullshit bitch I don't need it  
I cheated, you cheated  
We cheated, so beat it  
Eat it like a dick bitch you too conceited  
I broke it, replaced it  
I slammed it, I chased it  
Hands in the air if ya love gettin wasted baby!  
You never seen us before  
You betta come and get it  
You with it I'm with it  
I'm busy baby you fuckin with it  
Is it your place or mind  
don't want to waste your time  
And you can get it how you want it it'll blow ya mind  
Its over time  
Takin pride in the bump and grind  
A hit from behind to leave you with a broken spine  
This what its all about  
You better stall me out  
Its just the game of the name you bitches callin out  
  
[Chorus]  
Pop it, drink it  
Float it, sink it  
Plan to stop me then you better rethink it  
Drive it, use it  
Pimp it, abuse it  
Shit motherfuckers do to hip-hop music  
I live it, I die it  
I'm laughin, I'm cryin  
Pop two of these bitch, lets start flying  
I hear it, I taste it  
I touched it, I faced it  
Breakin down the bullshit back to the basics  
I had to kick in the door  
that's how I had to get it  
I shitted with lyrics  
And getting better for fuckin credit  
Gettin gangsta with it  
The best that ever did it  
Hit it and quit it my nigga  
You shouldn't babysit it  
We need more emcees and less wannabes  
Three hundred and sixty degrees of reality  
that's what its all about  
Kill em and haul em out  
Now feel the aim of the name you haters callin out  
  
[Chorus]

Yeah, check it out, they say behind every strong man  
Is an even stronger woman  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause she, was put here to defeat me  
Cause she, cuss me out, quick to leave me  
Cause she, not what I want, not what I want, not what I need  
Cause she, blow my phone up, to reach me  
Cause she, tried to lock, now she leaves me  
Cause she, not what I want, not what I want, not what I need  
  
Man, X aint' with that sucka shit  
I'm from a place, where they quick to say "Fuck A Bitch"  
And gettin' grits, off of pussy, try ta get a hitch  
But I'm a bachelor, stackin' it, drinkin', need to quit  
Me and my clique, ride through cities like we own the shit  
You caught my eye, looking fly, body lookin' thick  
So who am I? I reply with my government, exchange the numbers  
Escapades for days, satisfying my hunger  
Don't trip, you from a long list, a long line  
Get in line, you so fucking fine, you spendin' time  
Introduce you as a friend of mine, never my woman  
I got twenty twenty cord vision, seein' you comin'  
Livin' my life, I don't need a wife  
But you persist, tryin' ta strengthen our relationship  
But I'm a dog, and a dog gotta run the streets  
Without a leash, this ain't workin' so I'm sayin' peace  
You ain't the one for me!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You found some way to hold on, through all the bullshit  
Never seen a woman so strong, I used to pull shit  
Now them days, long been gone, I gotta move in them streets  
Provide a place for all my peoples to eat  
I'm feelin' stuck, had to hustle up  
The ATF hit the house, had me shackled up  
You lost your mind, hate the time, I was in and out  
You never let a brother down, when you stressin' out  
You stressin' wanted me, to figure out a different route  
You could've left, but you a rider and stuck it out  
And it's a trip, because it's like you never missed a beat  
You waited anxiously, patiently, stayin' strong for me  
I sat aside, thinking back to the way I was  
The way I am, and how I gotta be a stronger man  
I understand that you love me and you want the best  
But if you want to take the good, you gotta take the rest  
I rock a vest, baby!  
  
Cause I, run these streets for my struggle  
Cause I, carry heat for my troubles  
Cause I, is that what you want, is that what you want, is that what you need?  
Cause I, want family so I'm buildin'  
Cause I, want futures for my children  
Cause I, is that what you want, is that what you want, is that what you need?  
  
And all this time it was you  
Baby forgive me for the pain, I was puttin' you through  
It's me and you against the world, so I'm keepin' it true  
I know I haven't been the best, the wrong things I pursue  
I used to think I was the MAN, wasn't havin' a clue  
I wasn't lookin' for no love, but I found it in you  
It's so true, behind every great man is a women  
Every time you call me, Baby Girl, I'm a come runnin'  
You got a soldier livin' right, girl you saved my life  
I sacrifice, anything to keep my family tight  
I seen the light, and when the world try to beat me down  
You always given me another reason, I can smile  
Cause you believed in me, when there was nothin' there to see  
My wife can be my better half, complete my family tree  
Ugh, nothin' can stop us now, Vera Wang gown  
Watchin' your father, walk his little lady down the isle  
Cause you the one for me!  
  
Cause she, was put here to complete me  
Cause she, wooze the earth, underneath me  
Cause she, got what I want, got what I want, got what I need  
Cause she, won't let go, she won't leave me  
Cause she, won't leave, what she don't need me  
Cause she, got what I want, got what I want, got what I need  
  
Dedicated to the real ones out there  
Ugh, yeah, this is for you

(Xzibit talking)  
Come here Tre, what's up son, come on  
To whom it may concern, yeah, listen  
Sorry I'm away so much, yeah, yeah  
All the sons, daughters, penitentiary niggas, yeah feel me  
Uh, sorry I'm away so much, yeah  
  
(Xzibit)  
My son was born about four and a half years ago  
Loved and protected him, amazin how fast they grow  
I came to know about his likes and his dislikes (yeah)  
Video games, taught him how to ride his first bike (that's it)  
This is the life my little nigga, I see you gettin all upset  
When I leave the house, poutin, let me tell you about  
Tryna make it in this world and provide for you  
Cause on them overseat plane rides I miss you too  
Never knew that I would have to be away so much  
Five thousand dollar phone bills keepin in touch  
We Starskey and Hutch, yeah, we partners for life, yeah  
I rock mics, so I'm sorry when I hug you if I squeeze too tight  
Long nights in the studio take me away  
Gettin mad 'cause I'm tired and you want me to play  
Money can't replace time, I'm just tryna get you outta the fine relyin  
And expand your mind my lil' ni', yeah  
Yeah, c'mon  
  
(Chorus-X)  
Look, sorry I'm away so much  
Understand me, yeah  
It's for you, hah, yeah (you, and you, and you)  
c'mon, look, sorry I'm away so much  
Huh, we keep it gangsta  
Look  
  
(Xzibit)  
I got a brother locked down, he be out in a couple  
Knuckle for knuckle, a veteran and nothin but muscle  
Now broadcastin live from behind the wall  
Stayin tight through long kites and telephone calls  
Gettin hype when you see your brother on T.V.  
Can't wait for your release so you can roll with me  
Arrange everything exactly how it's supposed to be  
For right now here's a thousand, J, stay lo-key  
You say damn Xzibit, whyn't you pay a nigga a visit  
Time limits got me movin a million miles a minute  
Knee deep, gotta strike while the iron is hot  
Still gotta eat and keep the lights on when it's not  
Sleepin on cots, bullet wounds got you in knots  
I wish I was there to snatch you up instead of the cops  
Muthafuck it, do the time and get it out of the way  
You goin from convict to corporate nigga in one day (in one day)  
  
(Chorus)  
  
(Quik)  
Now I ain't never been this hot before  
So in essence it's obvious, I ain't never been this out before  
I'm spending 25-8 days, 366 times a year  
Up in the studio freakin and mixin rhymes in here  
Nothin but beer, bud smoke, Hen and Coke, women and sheer  
Callin playa niggas there  
Not the kinda place I really want to bring my son  
Get on lil' Dane, gon' in there and have you some fun  
Used to be that ??? be up there sewin ya clothes  
While I'm with you on the PlayStation showin you codes  
Hit the X button stupid, forward, left, right, X  
Now I'm tryna get your college fund, bustin with X  
  
(Suga Free)  
Come here, give that here dada,  
no no don't do that mama 'cause dada be back  
Here go your ba-ba, Pampers, flashy ???, you can see that  
You tryna figure out  
why dada talkin to you through this glass on the phone  
Ooh, I socked a bitch and then she snitched, but I'll be home  
Can't keep me away, just can't stay away  
  
(Chorus-Suga Free)  
(Suga Free talkin to fade)

I ma' clean this whole shit out like colonics  
With words put together better than Sony electronics  
King of the jungle, humbly stay honest  
Eat with the lions, swim with pyranhas  
Gasoline the seem, strike the match  
Inferno, I'm too thorough nigga' so stand back  
(Oof!)  
I spit shine, get mine and rip rhymes  
And make my career take an incline  
I'm strict with knives, straight with razors  
Good with grenades and great with gauges  
Been around the world in a million stages  
Watch niggas bitch up and go through changes  
I had guns before thugs was in fashion  
I mashed out before niggas knew mashin'  
I knew terror before the plane started crashin'  
I got punch lines and niggas ain't laughin'  
I'm gon' be here after the smoke die down  
Insomnia style, I won't lie down  
Fight the good fight, don't need no help  
Keep your hands up, defend yo' self  
Move like I move and live life long  
Can't move up if ya' heart not strong  
Get'cha own shit 'cause this shits mine  
(Yeah)  
Every time I spit I shine  
Cocksucka' I preach what I practise, back shit up  
Wrap this rap shit up, still actin' up  
Get found in a trunk of an Acura  
Y'all suck like jail and Dracula  
X turn up the heat, increase the hatred  
Straight stone faced don't fuck wit gay shit  
So I guess that means I can't fuck wit you now  
Two down, let off, vacate to new town  
It feel like Bishop and juice now  
Got a flame thrower that'll burn big holes through your goose down  
(Yeah!)  
Rough sound, same strong background  
Been on black, the big boys layin' chips down  
My whole train of thought is  
To bully any mothafucker wit problems and not get caught  
I was blessed with life but I curse to death  
I'm a spit to my very last breath, fuck y'all  
I'm gon' be here after the smoke die down  
Insomnia style, I won't lie down  
Fight the good fight, don't need no help  
Keep your hands up, defend yo' self  
Move like I move and live life long  
Can't move up if ya' heart not strong  
Get'cha own shit 'cause this shits mine  
Every time I spit I shine  
Let me give this a three second look, I hit a million dollar target  
You ain't came up yet, well nigga' let me show ya'  
Come across dope like planes and boats  
Like balloons filled with Coke down a mexican's throat  
You ever seen a man get smoked, they shit on they self  
Their body shake for a second then it gets dissected  
For evidence of the weapon and the people involved  
Let one nigga' talk, everybody gettin' caught fa sho'  
I say that to say this  
(What?)  
If you can't handle the time then ride the bitch  
Might as well touch ya' tail and jump the fence  
Castrate ya' self, expose the bitch  
X go head up, but fuck, never ran from it  
I got a gauge with buck shot that you can't stomach  
You ain't a killa, you a album filla  
You ain't a soldier, you a rap promoter, game over  
I'm gon' be here after the smoke die down  
Insomnia your style, I won't lie down  
Fight the good fight, don't need no help  
Keep your hands up, defend yo' self  
Move like I move and live life long  
Can't move up if ya' heart not strong  
Get'cha own shit 'cause this shits mine  
Every time I spit I shine  

I'm heavy hearted, heavy headed, misunderstand it  
Try the permanent repercussions, I empty the cannon  
I'm addicted to ganja, roll it up in a wood  
Drink a gallon of heaty, throw it up with the hood  
I'm a rhyme for my people, give my people a voice  
Never follow the leader, use the weapon of choice  
This is not an illusion, this is not a mirage  
Conversation with God, spilling my soul out  
I own assault weapons that fall down like Megatron  
The iron mob, try better bombs, I'm better alone  
So tag along like a dog with a bag of bones  
Smoke to the sack of gold, nigga on a grind  
Put my motherfucker records on  
So they can relate to the hate and the pain  
To the struggle and strain  
Never take it in vain, bring the one and the same  
Press and push your forehead at the back of your brain  
So now  
  
[Chorus]  
Let's spread it out, nigga  
Yeah, yeah  
Spread it out, spread it out, spread it out  
It go oooo, oooo  
And you can't get none, you don't want none  
You can't get none  
Spread the fuck out, gets these hot ones  
  
I try not to get involved with the nonsense  
I'm from the time where you couldn't pause comments  
Couldn't hide behind a computer  
Catch a fatal get shot by a shooter  
A barracuda for Buddha  
I maneuver to the manure, ignore the allure, the illusion  
My bad, sorry for all the confusion  
If you thought I was finished, if you thought I was done  
The saga continue, bring it back on the one  
I'm coming back with a gun, cause I saw that I know  
Meditated intentions, my shit ready to go  
Never taking a smoke, in my profession you need aggression  
A weapon, you can brand the shit to your own discretion  
And I hear, just a sandwich, nigga, what's your preference?  
I chose bad and now I'm headed in a right direction  
They're sick of the decisions, now my family is good  
Make you well understood, put you back where you should be  
  
[Chorus]  
  
This go for all my people, people who see we're equal  
I feel they come, it is dark, I protect us from evil  
We misheard an illusion, car can make a confusion  
People constantly losing, we suffer everywhere  
Enough with all this swagger, party's a baggy bagger  
We hear a session is starting, let me show you what's heading at  
Money's so fucking tight, the root to all them fights  
She make you wanna not ever, not ever come home at night  
But she know that you go off with that stripping ho  
While your woman is wondering where does all your money go  
You try to make it rain, maybe lock you a chain  
Maybe inducing brain from bitches everywhere  
Pussy nigga, you lame, get on top of your game  
Feed your family, man, this is simple and plain  
Children retain, remember living upon the pain  
That's when they curse your name, they will see you do the same  
Yeah, so spread it out, nigga  
  
[Chorus]

Man, I'm talking about that six four rag top  
Green, with the back racked  
Everything mat black, caught it in a six pack  
You know what the fuck it is and what I came to do  
Now put your hands up in the air, like I'm about to shoot  
My agenda is here, crystal perfectly clear  
Breathe apocalypse in, we have nothing to fear  
We have nothing to lose, pressure applying the rules  
Wasp on a motherfucker and knock him up out of his shoes  
That's what my coast love, good money, great drugs  
Every bad bitch you can think of  
Swagged out, locked out, flamed on, purve out  
Shit face from shots, your words come swirled up  
Better put the word out, mind I find the mediocre  
I'm a bust it down, serve 'em like a bunch of smokers  
You can fuck around, who else get the fly  
You know I asked your little mind is your prime world dying over  
  
[Chorus]  
Order in the court, that's what you came to see  
The state of hip hop versus mister X to the Z  
Not a verdict to see, just the moment of truth  
Fighting the fight of my life, jury ready to shoot  
I be my own attorney, watching you try to burn me down  
Testimony testifier from the underground  
Order in the court, that's what you came to see  
The state of hip hop versus mister X to the Z  
  
I create in a dark, darkest place in my heart  
I finish off with your started terror, I tear you apart  
I am not for the cage, I'm the climb to the change  
Dread the eye and the needle, that means accurate aim  
That means I can arrange haters and hideous things  
I'm the sickness you feel, sickness from popping a vein  
Paranormal presence to people who can never explain  
Why deal with the devil when dealing with you is the same  
I got a proposition for all you bitches listening  
Get in position, let me nail it like a crucifixion  
Give you what you've been missing  
A man in my condition shouldn't be allowed around crowds without supervision  
Call it a superstition, can't get this out my system  
I got a fetish for fucking over my opposition  
It's time to set the standing, the mother ship is landing  
We didn't come here in peace, we're here to take the player  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I came up with the wolf, they came out with them tools  
Elevate you out the earth gravitational pool  
This is not for the week, this time works for the streets  
Mister X to the Z, motherfuck, what you think?  
Motherfuck, what you blog, this for my loss and my dogs  
Standing tall, still calling shots from behind the wall  
I've been tried and I'm true, reassemble my crew  
Carry on tradition, position I'm put here to do  
Make movements my elemental, I did make some improvements  
You can check my potential, tool to never pursue it  
If I listen to critics, there would be no Xzibit  
Dreams splattered and broken never breaking my spirit  
Listen close, you can hear it, the footsteps of the future  
Ain't no time like the present, live the past and excuses  
Fucked on anything, fuck it, I keep it exclusive  
You just saw as if acoustic, this that real nigga music

Time to snap out of it, welcome to the real world  
My life like a Hitchcock flick, stick to the script  
If she can't stick to the script, stick to this dick  
How she actin off of the fifth? Ridiculous shit  
We don't need conversation, just crowd participation  
If you here on vacation we got, rules and regulations  
Seperate myself from y'all, segregation  
Tryin to stop Xzibit and Dre? Humiliation  
Pure elevation, got me some inspiration  
Two bitches in bubble baths, a beautiful invitation  
Got a live occupation, live for the moment  
I'm faced with an altercation manhandlin my opponents  
I got eyes in the back of my head  
I never sleep so they bloodshot red  
Yo we so far ahead of our time  
If we can stop life and press rewind  
You still wouldn't catch up 'til 2K and a dime, so turn it up  
  
Turn it up! Turn it up  
This is it! This is it  
We the shit We the shiiiiiiiiiit Get with it!

Truthfully speakin, it's lonely up here all by myself  
So I had to come down and pass around some help  
From N.W.A to whatever's next  
Make sure it says ANDRE YOUNG in bold letters on big checks  
Your shit ain't sellin? Fuck it, get Dr. Dre on it  
You got a budget? I'll get down, give me half of it  
One session, one song, I'm gone  
The first week, you hit the streets, a star is born  
to add to my universe - let me show you  
who can invade who nigga, and who can do who the worst  
Warning from the Surgeon General  
Watch out for fake hits and bullshit that sounds identical  
Pick it up, read the credits, who you thought it was?  
Twenty years in the game, with a constant buzz  
Pick a year, any year, see how hot I was  
Same shit today, and still don't give a fuck!

Bounce like this Bounce Bounce like this  
Blaze your shit Blaze your shit  
And get high for meeeeeeee  
  
Let me give y'all niggaz somethin to hold  
This product not to be sold  
Know you can't cook it over a stove  
You can flip it and come back with a mitt  
Don't make me reach through your limo tint  
I just want my twenty percent  
This is dedicated to the people that spoke too soon  
I think I'll stop shootin you niggaz and shoot for the moon  
Motherfuckers turn respect on and off like a light switch  
I'll never be seen, like Farrakhan fuckin a white bitch  
Jump I won't flinch, dump I don't miss  
X holdin this, I'm never losin faith or focus  
So say what you gotta say, every day a holiday  
We don't blow the roof, we blow the whole fuckin spot away  
Organize permission like, organized crime  
Organized minds, organize they nickels and dimes  
Organized vocab be organizing my rhymes  
Organizing my business and organizing my time, so turn it up  
  
Turn it up! Turn it up

Yeah.. welcome.. yeah.. huh.. there's plenty of room for everybody man..  
Yeah.. bangin.. come on.. yeah.. look..  
  
[Xzibit]  
Huh, Stay in my lane like a hustla  
Never hate a motherfucker,tolerate a motherfucker  
To a certain extent  
When it's on, it's over  
Don't get no chance to get popping  
Forgotten about you before your body cold in a coffin  
Just another failed attempt, you fall through the cracks  
Sure as God made man, the first man was Black  
The Black man made pyramids and gangsta rap  
That's all I know, 'cause poppa didn't raise no rats  
Face the facts not the fiction  
I Build my empire from a pocket full of stones  
And a fifth of ambition  
Niggas want to ball but they never want to listen  
So instead of coming up, they just, come up missin  
My mission is to hit with precision, shake whole continents  
Crush niggas' confidence, expose my dominance  
Without no conflict, you'll never have progress  
I'm sending this one out to all the neighborhoods and projects, I'm a  
  
[Chorus - A.H. singing (Xzibit)]  
One shot gambler (Yeah) Two shot gambler (Come on)  
Three-time felon with that itch for dough  
These madd street (Whuttup) Got me puffin on dro'  
I'm guilty (What) Tryna make a living (Work it)  
Thirty-eight albums and still no dollars (Come on)  
And you want to know why I hit the block for mo'? (Yeah)  
These madd street (Uh) Got me puffin on dro' (Uh)  
I'm guilty .. For tryna make a living  
  
[Xzibit]  
Bitch I ain't tryna holler at you (nah)  
I'm just want to drink, smoke, fuck and toss a couple dollars at you  
I'm fightin dirty, I'll take thirty of you motherfuckers  
I'm throwing cheapshots, low-blows and suckerpunches  
I'm not for the games, I'm not in the mood  
Not to be confused with dudes that fumble and lose  
Xzibit move when I hear oppurtunity knockin  
But I'ma shoot straight through the door if you comin with problems  
It's too crowded at the bottom, too lonely at the top  
Ain't no inbetween, trust me, like it or not  
We gon' be here forever like cops and roaches  
Do not approach us, ferocious, we pop them toasters, nigga  
  
[Interlude - A.H. (X)]  
I'ma have to hit the block, then around to my hoes  
I got a haze, two trays, and a change of clothes, 'cause  
Pimpin' ain't easy why'all,it's too sleazy  
Too greasy, and I can't take it easy!  
  
[Chorus]  
[Xzibit]  
Everytime I try to get out  
I get dragged right the fuck back in, it's like I'm never gon' win  
Nigga got the whole world on his back  
Overeact, matter fact we act like when animals attack  
I know, pussy sells faster than crack, ambassador rap  
Twist back your salary cap, who fuckin with that?  
Welcome to the X games, enjoy my pain  
Inhale my smoke, it's hard not to cough or choke  
Motorola nigga up the old fashion way  
This ain't rap, this is shit that I was born to say  
Though lately I been having dillemas, with insignificant niggas  
And half-ass rappers that think they can get it  
We the Golden State, we keep the whole thing bouncing  
Why'all move units, we move mountains  
Why'all rap for bullshit, tryna be on T.V.  
We seen you, now we don't like Chandra Levy, I'ma  
  
[Chorus]

Big bad insane Strong Arm Steady gang  
Way beyond the days of rockin' them stupid rapper chains  
Comin' through clear the lane, send a bullet through your brain  
Number one with a bullet, faster than the bullet train  
Pop it if you pull it mayne, hang with orangutans  
I live for my soldiers, ask them, they gon' say the same  
My gauge rings your bells like the Hunchback of Notre Dame  
Ain't even gotta say it, you motherfuckers know the name  
Legendary classic, niggaz be punk pussy and plastic  
Wastin' the time and the minds of the masses (yeah!)  
But look how strong we are, man I'm a motherfuckin' star  
Every week I cop a house and a car  
The mini-mansion off in Vegas with the vanquish  
That's where I mastermind my situations, determination and patience  
We don't speak the same language (no) I got a translator  
Spittin' twenty five times, see your bitch ass later, see'mon!  
  
[Chorus]  
That nigga X to the Z, that boy is somethin' to see, cause he a G  
I got the whole world waitin' on me!  
I'm about that grind so motherfucker don't waste my time  
I got the whole world waitin' on me!  
If you ready to ride, c'mon, get in my ride and let's slide  
I got the whole world waitin' on me!  
Yeah! I got the whole world waitin' on me!  
  
Niggaz screamin' they the shit but that shit ain't real  
I don't need to be the shit cause shit roll downhill  
I'm escalatin' aggressively, millions built up in equity  
Corporations invest in me, bangin' shit 'til the death of me (yeah!)  
Cooked coke recipe, money come back so thick  
My kid's kids couldn't spend this shit  
Get a grip, pop a clip, chop down that brick  
No amount of fame gon' change this gangsta spit  
Quick to roll out the backwood (yeah) smoke out your buildin'  
We soldiers devoted dressed down like civilians  
Niggaz wanna kill me because I make millions (that's weak!)  
That's weak like gangstas that hide behind children (hahaha, yeah!)  
Novocain the game, no shame  
No feelings, no names, no numbers, naw bitch  
You can't hang with us (no!)  
Ashes to ashes and you can't bust  
You so popcorn and fake industrious, yeah!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah, yeah, whattup Key?  
I'm liftin' plates you'll never find in the weight room  
So stay tuned my platoon finna touch down soon  
Cancun to St. Thomas, St. Thomas to the Bahamas  
Most niggaz ain't really honest so I'm watchin' my step  
I'm the hardest cold-hearted artist, the coast is clear  
Dubai, Australia to Africa, this is the year!  
Let the alcohol you sippin saturate in yo' system  
I be swimmin' through these women, man, fuck 'em and flip 'em  
I know you hopin' I would fall to the side, or go to Way Side  
It ain't a motherfucker alive to come and take mine (no!)  
Don't procrastinate, don't waste time  
Never faced time, Houdini with crime, traffic over state lines  
Military minded, stickin' to the base lines  
Intellectually brighter than California sunshine  
Yeah, I got my bars up, go pull my cars up (yeah)  
I love my struggle, never cover my scars up (c'mon)  
Nigga  
  
[Chorus]

Xzibit intro:  
Yes yes. ahh ahh. bring it live  
Yo it's the x to the z from the likwit squad  
Hook:  
"one mc" "after" (x3)  
"on the mic"- souls of mischief  
[xzibit]  
All that get money take money sound funny  
So I stick to my own I can feel it in my bones  
These clones and clowns ain't really down  
Play the background westbound  
Huntin' down pussy like a bloodhound  
Plus I feel that no style is darker than mine  
You can stick that into places where the sun don't shine  
All you one hit wonders only in it for the spotlight  
Spend half a million dollars still don't sound tight  
Bring truth to the light  
I write rhymes for the under  
Blunt smokin' bottle crackin' all day slumber  
Who wouldn't give a fuck if the world fell down  
As long as I can twist a fat one and pass it around  
Mr. x to the z from the likwit crew  
La to elviaire with my man eq  
Coming live and direct with your neck like this  
Come home and smoke a spliff in the benz with swift  
I stay fucked up  
Hook  
[del]  
Lyrically ingenious my flows are intravenous  
Kids are squeamish  
When they attempt to refless  
I'm the apex  
Shows get rocked half the words ?  
Hold your glock your whole goal is props  
You'll never get 'em  
My rhythm just fluctuates  
You can't o.d. no matter how much you take  
I rush your plates  
Crack your lenses clean like benzene  
Cool like menthol  
My shits the end all  
Majorly gain your speed slow your role  
You lie and like pinochio your nose will grow  
Let's go  
Underground compress co  
Bust these jewels these diamonds out  
But still some of these niggas don't know what we rhymin' bout  
Mine in doubt  
Traversing' the earth like zombies  
And rocks your dirty laundry  
Presented to the world as comedy  
Del rips it honestly that's why the girls are found of me  
And don't be squandering your little flow  
You ain't got many  
You're fly spinning  
We constitution  
You seek contribution from del for usage  
Over these acoustics  
I take time out for use of  
Harkus representing proof in you walkman  
Lockin' competition out of studios  
Everyday I live is like a musical  
Create my own score  
More funkier than shaft on my musical path  
Hook  
[casual]  
They like "ooh. don't say that."  
When it's lay doe a dat competition where they at?  
I diss 'em  
Steady at the rhythm  
Like a pilot I keep you silent  
Through the turbulence words will get violent  
Mega doses exposes is flagellant composes  
All you get is roses on your grave you misbehave  
It's the brave courageous lyrically contagious  
Spiritually engage with the psychedelic waves of  
An egyptian  
We rips then  
Cover the mic like the sun we eclipsin'  
Cause no light shine through a flow like mine  
Casual might ignite the mic for pastime  
With one style older than the sundial  
My elaborate connection of words is fun how  
I display, dismay this way gettin' bissy  
Crackers show off the top while I'm hittin' a j  
My immaculate style attackin' with nouns and verbs  
For the wack it gets foul  
Got a full metal jacket off rhymes to press  
To manifest under pressure  
Past style a lyrical treasure  
Never the less I get fresher  
It's involital my biological make up composes of flesh and blows  
Will dispose of all  
When they appear in my crystal ball  
I know you wish I fall  
"yes y'all"  
Hook  

I wanna speak to you motherfuckers for a minute  
Yea thanks for the lighter  
Anybody smoke here?  
Aight, that's more for me you punk  
Motherfuckers  
Look, check it out, look  
[verse 1]  
Everybody, he was born to hustle  
It's a very thin line between the boss  
And the muscle  
We foot soldiers  
Face first in the trenches  
Only time I'm on my back is fucking these  
Hoes and weight bitches  
Hell's kitchen, raw kitchen  
Never crying and bitching and settling  
For less  
Metal in your chest, take a final breath  
Revolutionary  
It's x-man the mercenary  
Carry a .44 desert eagle  
Feeding the people even if it ain't legal  
Low-riding in the regal or the cadillac  
Money stacked probably give yo ass a  
Heart attack  
Purchased your last cd I want my money  
Back  
You see the battle ima see you in the  
Street  
Survival of the first to draw the heaters  
And the cannons  
I'm guaranteed to be the last man standing  
[chorus 2x]  
Crack a bottle for your hard time  
It's dedicated to my soldiers on the  
Front line  
This one's for all of us  
Thinking bout your casualties  
Learn from mistakes, protect your family  
Cause it's the year 2000  
[verse 2]  
Everybody wannabe king  
Fuck everything  
All this shit is bout to me mine  
I hear it all the time  
Live your life for the day  
Easier to burn than papier-mache  
Started with dre  
Graduate to radioplay  
I still ain't satisfied  
Bout to blast off worldwide  
Get in line check the politics  
Ever wonder why only certain  
Motherfuckers get rich  
Ain't this a bitch  
Barely can eat, barely can pee  
I dedicate my life to the street  
It's not for you if your stomach is weak  
Relax with dead bodies covered with sheets  
That's the only time I really find peace  
Having violent stand-offs with the police  
North hollywood beef  
Grinding my teeth  
Have you stuck and stunned in disbelief  
New breed I'm the bad seed  
Smoke your weed til my mothafucking eyes  
Bleed  
Dedicated to the niggas that despise us  
So ain't nobody s'posed to be here  
Besides us  
Catch a flatline  
[chorus 2x]  
[verse 3]  
I was one that never begged for nothing  
Me and my homies build penitentiary  
Huff-it  
Running your mouth like a bitch cause you  
All on my dick  
What is he dogg pound now? is he still  
With tha liks?  
Is he rich? is xzibit a crip? this is  
Business stay the fuck out of my family shit  
A grown man, the back of my hand is what  
You will see  
If the x-fives make you believe  
You check the sound scan I do the math  
Me and my staff run a worldwide warpath  
A bloodbath, make xzibit have a good laugh  
It's going down, hit the ground like a  
Plane crash  
You lil fags ain't prepared for the x-man  
Scared and desperate  
Young and restless  
There is no guest list  
Move to the back of the line  
Yo it's my time, prime time only where the  
Beats and the rhyme shine  
[chorus 2x]
