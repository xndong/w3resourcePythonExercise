She said,  
"I wanna be the rain, I am a red balloon, I got a book of dates."  
She's gonna go away and leave me here tonight  
Some worlds last longer then others  
She's got a red balloon, she's gonna be the sky,  
I'm gonna paint my face tonight  
Hey 99 days out of San Francisco  
Headed for Berlin  
Hey 99 days left of California  
Headed with the wind  
If I sail across the water, I'll be floating blind, here beside the wild  
Monkey came alive, she's leaving me behind  
It's so hard to find  
She said,  
"I wanna be a plane, I am a red balloon, I'll never be the same  
And I'm gone, gone, gone on the wind."  
She said,  
"You'll never get away, you need a red balloon, you need a better day.  
This time, your headed home this time."  
Some trips last longer then others, she just said, "Good-bye."  
She just float away, I'm gonna die right here this time  
Some girls last longer then others,  
Too few red balloons, too little time tonight  
Hey 99 days out San Francisco  
Headed for Berlin  
Hey 99 days left of California  
Setting with the wind, home

This time is better than last time  
I feel better today  
A little discipline can lock you up inside  
This time I think you she'd a little light  
I feel better today  
A little discipline can bring you down sometimes  
This time I got some other ideas  
But I don't want them to hear  
No, I don't want them to hear  
And it may not seem like a sensible scheme  
But I think I'd really like to die  
Into the pit of my desire or a bed of fire tonight  
"Oh no, this is the last time,  
Honey" she whispers in my ear  
But every time I look at her she disappears  
Ahh, this time is better than last time  
I feel better today  
And the music can plays and the elevator sways  
But I don't really feel like dancing'  
Because elevator dreams never really have much of a beat  
She says, "Oh no, this is the last time,  
Honey, we just wanna calm you down.  
You have nothing to fear,  
We will get you out of here."  
But every time I look at her she disappears  
Oh, this time is better than last time  
I feel better today  
A little discipline can twist you inside out  
This time I think you busted the bubble  
And I feel much better today  
A little discipline can mess you up inside  
This time I feel I need a little lift  
And I feel like I am a razor  
And I feel like I am a razor  
And the TV pans and the elephants dance  
And the nurse looks like she's angry  
So the pills slide down in the septic town tonight  
She says "Bad boy, just like the last time,  
Honey" and bites me on the ear  
But when I turn to look at her she disappears  
Oh, this time I think you she'd a little light  
I feel much better today  
And the elevator dreams with the hobby horse scream  
I feel like I'm going' home  
But the nurse says "Son, you're going' nowhere tonight"  
She says "Oh no, this is the last time  
Sonny, we're gonna have to tie you down  
'cause you gotta see clear to be getting out of here"  
But then every time I look at her she disappears  
Oh, this time I feel a little bit...  
But I feel better today  
A little discipline can take you out sometime  
This time, I feel I might be better  
I feel much, much better today  
A little discipline can turn you inside out  
This time I think you she'd a little light  
I feel better today  
A little discipline can fuck you up inside  
This time I feel a little foggy  
A little discipline can weigh you down sometimes  
I'm dreaming, underground  
A little discipline can suffocate your mind  
This time, I'm flying home  
A little discipline can drive you into the ground  
This time I think you she'd a little light  
I feel much better today  
A little discipline can lock you up inside  
A little discipline can lock you up

A long December and there's reason to believe  
Maybe this year will be better than the last  
I can't remember the last thing that you said as you were leavin'  
Now the days go by so fast  
  
And it's one more day up in the canyons  
And it's one more night in Hollywood  
If you think that I could be forgiven I wish you would  
  
The smell of hospitals in winter  
And the feeling that it's all a lot of oysters, but no pearls  
All at once you look across a crowded room  
To see the way that light attaches to a girl  
  
And it's one more day up in the canyons  
And it's one more night in Hollywood  
If you think you might come to California I think you should  
  
Drove up to Hillside Manor sometime after two a.m.  
And talked a little while about the year  
I guess the winter makes you laugh a little slower,  
Makes you talk a little lower about the things you could not show her  
  
And it's been a long December and there's reason to believe  
Maybe this year will be better than the last  
I can't remember all the times I tried to tell my myself  
To hold on to these moments as they pass  
  
And it's one more day up in the canyon  
And it's one more night in Hollywood  
It's been so long since I've seen the ocean I guess I should  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I Heard my Lisa say  
"I can't believe you could leave me looking this way."  
When ever music plays... I smile and I can't feel anything  
All I want to say..(All I want to say)  
Is everything's all right and I'm ok  
Heard my Lisa today  
"say he wants to paint the same me every single day"  
"what's wrong with him anyway?"  
Cuz sometimes I can't feel anything  
All I want to say..(All I want to say)  
Is everything's all right and I'm ok.. I'm ok  
My body's mapped before me..  
On a flying carpet through the sky  
The same things that destroy me...  
We'll hang there waiting for me upon a wall outside of me yeah.  
Heard my Lisa say  
"god blesses the same things every single day."  
How'd he miss me anyway? 7 days and I can't feel anything.  
My paint is smeared upon his wall..  
Its a portrait we are 4 feet tall.. Just Leanardo passing days  
With a Mona Lisa can't feel anything. All I want to say..(All I want to say)  
Is everything's all right and I'm ok all I want to say....(all I want to say)  
Is everything's all right and I'm ok [7X]

So she said what's the problem baby  
What's the problem I don't know  
Well maybe I'm in love (love)  
Think about it every time  
I think about it  
Can't stop thinking 'bout it  
  
How much longer will it take to cure this  
Just to cure it cause I can't ignore it if it's love (love)  
Makes me want to turn around and face me but I don't know nothing 'bout love  
  
Come on, come on  
Turn a little faster  
Come on, come on  
The world will follow after  
Come on, come on  
'Cause everybody's after love  
  
So I said I'm a snowball running  
Running down into the spring that's coming all this love  
Melting under blue skies  
Belting out sunlight  
Shimmering love  
  
Well baby I surrender  
To the strawberry ice cream  
Never ever end of all this love  
Well I didn't mean to do it  
But there's no escaping your love  
  
These lines of lightning  
Mean we're never alone,  
Never alone, no, no  
  
Come on, come on  
Move a little closer  
Come on, come on  
I want to hear you whisper  
Come on, come on  
Settle down inside my love  
  
Come on, come on  
Jump a little higher  
Come on, come on  
If you feel a little lighter  
Come on, come on  
We were once upon a time in love  
  
We're accidentally in love  
Accidentally in love  
Accidentally in love  
Accidentally in love  
Accidentally in love  
  
Accidentally in love  
Accidentally in love  
Accidentally in love  
  
Accidentally  
  
I'm in love, I'm in love,  
I'm in love, I'm in love,  
I'm in love, I'm in love,  
Accidentally  
I'm in love, I'm in love,  
I'm in love, I'm in love,  
I'm in love, I'm in love,  
Accidentally  
  
Come on, come on  
Spin a little tighter  
Come on, come on  
And the world's a little brighter  
Come on, come on  
Just get yourself inside her  
  
Love I'm in love

Thought I might get a rocket ride  
When I was a child but it was a lie  
That I told myself when I needed something good  
At seventeen, had a better dream.  
Now I'm thirty-three and it isn't me  
But I'd think of something better if I could  
  
All my friends and lovers leave me behind  
I'm still looking for a girl  
One way or another  
I'm just hoping to find a way  
To put my feet out in the world  
  
Caught some grief from a falling leaf  
As she tumbled down to the dirty ground  
Said I should have put her back there if I could  
But everyone needs a better day  
And I'm trying to find me a better way  
To get from the things I do to the things I should  
  
All my friends and lovers leave me alone  
To try to have a little fun  
One way or another I just wish I had known  
To go out walking in the sun  
And find out if you were the one  
  
Does it make you wanna come a little closer now?  
And did you wanna dance with me?  
Did you wanna hum a little harder now?  
Can you see her waiting there?  
Can you see her? Because I'm almost there  
Can you see her waiting there for someone like me?  
All you want is a beauty queen  
Not a superstar but everybody's dream machine  
All you want is a place to lay your head  
You go to sleep dreaming how you would  
Be a different kind if you thought you could  
But you come awake the way you are instead  
  
All my friends and lovers shine like the sun  
I just turn and walk away  
One way or another  
I'm not coming undone  
I'm just waiting for the day  

If I could make it rain today  
And wash away this sunny day down to the gutter  
I would  
Just to get a change of pace  
Things are getting worse but I feel a lot better  
And that's all that really matters to me  
  
Amy hit the atmosphere  
Caught herself a rocket ride out of this gutter and  
She's never coming back, I fear  
But any time it rains,  
She just feels a lot better  
And that's all that really matters to me  
  
We've waited so long for someone to take us back home  
It just takes so long  
And meanwhile the days go drifting away  
And some of us sink like a stone  
Waiting for mothers to come  
  
There has to be a change, I'm sure  
Today was just a day fading into another  
And that can't be what a life is for  
The only thing she said was she feels a lot better  
And that's all that really matters to me

People dying from lonely days  
Were walking and trying to take our souls away  
Were just spending out our time angels in America slapping on a dime  
Slide here for me  
Get these chains away and I'm never quite free  
She walks like she is on a line  
Angels in America trying to get things done  
All on a bad day  
All on a run way..  
She says I'm ok.  
Bright lights shine in midnight  
He's dying for his children looking for his life  
She wonders why she's got to die?  
Angels in America trying to hard to fly  
This time well make it on or own  
The forces are teeming and the guns are coming low  
All on a bad day all on a bad day.

Well I guess you left me with some feathers in my hand  
Did it make it any easier to leave me where I stand?  
I guess there might not be too many who would stand beside you now  
Where'd you come from? Where am I going?  
Why'd you leave me 'till I'm only good for...  
  
Waiting for you  
All my sins...  
I said that I would pay for them if I could come back to you  
All my innocence is wasted on the dead and dreaming  
  
Every night these silhouettes appear above my head  
Little angels of the silences that climb into my bed and whisper  
Every time I fall asleep Every time I dream  
"Did you come? Would you lie?  
Why'd you leave us 'till we're only good for...  
  
Waiting for you"  
All my sins...  
I said that I would pay for them if I could come back to you  
All my innocence is wasted on the dead and dreaming  
  
I dream of Michelangelo when I'm lying in my bed  
Little angels hang above my head and read me like an open book  
Suck my blood break my nerve offer me their arms  
Well, I will not be an enemy of anything  
I'll only stand here  
  
Waiting for you  
All my sins...  
I said that I would pay for them if I could come back to you  
All my innocence is wasted on the dead and dreaming  

My friend assures me "it's all or nothing"  
I am not worried, I am not overly concerned  
My friend implores me: "For one time only make an exception"  
I am not not worried  
Wrap her up in a package of lies send her off to a coconut island  
I am not worried, I am not overly concerned  
With the status of my emotions "Oh", She says, "You're changing."  
  
But we're always changing  
It does not bother me to say this isn't love  
Because if you don't want to talk about it then it isn't love  
And I guess I'm going to have to live with that  
But, I'm sure there's something in a shade of grey or something in between  
And I can always change my name if that's what you mean  
  
My friend assures me "It's all or nothing"  
But I am not really worried, I am not overly concerned  
You try to tell yourself the things you tell yourself to make yourself forget  
I am not worried  
"If it's love", she said, "then were gonna have to think about the  
consequences"  
She can't stop shaking and I can't stop touching her and.....  
  
This time when kindness falls like rain  
It washes her away and Anna begins to change her mind  
"These seconds when I'm shaking leave me shuddering for days" she says  
And I'm not ready for this sort of thing  
  
But I'm not gonna break and I'm not going to worry about it anymore  
I'm not gonna bend and I'm not gonna break  
I'm not gonna worry about it anymore  
It seems like I should say "as long as this is love..."  
But it's not all that easy so maybe I should just:  
Snap her up in a butter fly net and just pin her down on a photograph album  
I am not worried, I've done this sort of thing before  
But then I start to think about the consequences  
Because I don't get no sleep in a quiet room and...  
  
The time when kindness falls like rain  
It washes me away and Anna begins to change my mind  
And every time she sneezes I believe it's it's love and  
Oh lord.... I'm not ready for this sort of thing  
  
She's talking in her sleep  
It's keeping me awake and Anna begins to toss and turn  
And every word is nonsense but I understand and  
Oh lord... I'm not ready for this sort of thing  
  
Her kindness bangs a gong  
It's moving me along and Anna begins to fade away  
It's chasing me away  
She disappears and  
Oh lord, I'm not ready for this sort of thing  

Margery's dreaming of the middle of the day  
Tiyuri to win  
Perfect Dozen to place  
money is the matter that's been on her mind  
time ticks by her one race at a time  
  
She's tryin' to be a good girl  
And give 'em what they want  
But Margery's dreaming of horses  
  
Lookin' at a green sky  
Sun like a red eye  
Bright blue horses are the fortune she lives by  
She's tired and lonely  
Scared and depressed  
Her visions of one day go racing the next  
  
She's trying to be a good girl  
And give 'em what they want  
But Margery's dreaming of horses  
  
Margie doesn't say anything all the way home  
So afraid she'll awake to find she's all alone  
  
Margery's wingspan's all feathers and coke cans, and  
TV dinners and letters she won't send, and  
Every race night is shot through with sunlight  
Trying to hit the big one one last time tonight for...  
  
Drunken fathers and stupid mothers and  
Boys who can't tell one girl from another  
So she takes her pills  
Careful and round  
One of these days she's gonna throw the whole bottle down  
  
But she's trying to be a good girl  
And give 'em what they want  
But Margery's dreaming of...  
  
Trying to be a good girl  
And give 'em what they want  
But Margery's dreaming of horses

I'm always thinking  
Of someone new  
I'm never sitting  
OK with you  
There's always something else on my mind  
There's always something I can't find  
  
[Chorus]  
You think about anything you can  
I think about you  
I'll think about anything it's true  
  
I'm almost perfect  
Some of the time  
I'm also sinking  
Some of the time  
  
I'm almost ready  
Yeah, it's almost true  
For almost anyone but you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm always sinking  
Beneath the sand  
You're holding nothing in your hand  
  
[Chorus]

They're wakin' up Maria 'cause everybody else has got some place to go  
She makes a little motion with her head,  
Rolls over,  
And she says she's gonna sleep for a couple minutes more  
I've said "I'm sorry" to Maria for the cold hearted thing that I have done  
I've said "I'm sorry", by now, at least once to just about everyone  
She says, "I've forgotten what I'm supposed to do today,"  
And it slips my mind what I'm supposed to say?  
We're getting older and older, and older  
And always a little further out of the way  
You look into her eyes and it's more than your heart will allow  
In August and Everything After, you get a little less than you expected,
somehow...  
  
I stumbled into Washington Square just as the sun began to rise  
I lay down on the lawn of the cathedral  
Right down with the shadow of St. Mary's in the sky  
And I'm just one of these late model children waiting for the king  
Yeah, but there ain't no sign of Elvis in San Fransisco  
It's just me, and I'm playing this rock and roll thing  
And She wants to be just like me  
And I want every damn thing I can see.  
One day you're Daddy's little angel,  
The next day you're everything he wanted you to be  
They dress you up in white satin  
And they give you your very own pair of wings  
In August and Everything After, I'm after everything.  
  
I said and la la la la...  
  
Well now I got my reservations and I got my seven million-dollar home  
And I got, I got the number of some girl in New York City  
Who's always wide awake so I never have to spend the night alone  
I got this nasty little habit of peeking down the shirts  
Of all the little girls as they pass me by  
And I wonder if it all catches up to me  
Do you think they'll take me down?  
Do you think I'm gonna cry?  
Well, I've already got your disease,  
So take your fucking filthy hands off of me  
Well I hope you weren't expecting me to be crucified,  
The best that they can do is just to hang me from the nearest tree  
  
It's midnight in san francisco,  
and I am waiting here for jesus on my knees  
in august and everything after  
I want somebody else to bleed for me  
I said la la la la... Na na....  
  
Well I came down from north dakota  
'cause I had confidence in the military mind  
and now, everyone I know is turning show girl  
and is dancing with their shirt off in some las vegas hotel line  
so I'm going to new york city 'cause it gotta little sleazy here for me  
when I find myself alone I know I'm never going home  
I make the changes the changes that I need  
but I no longer know how to pray  
and I'm living in A dog town and it's A dalmation parade  
I change my spots, over and over  
but they never seem to fade away  
now I am the last remaining indian  
looking for the place where the buffalo roam  
in august and everything after, man them buffalo ain't never coming home  
I said in august and everything after, man them buffalo ain't never coming
home  
I said na na... La la...

After you're gone, babies  
Ride the soft machine  
Threading the warm children  
Down the space between  
Into a slow heaven  
Hanging by a thread  
Leaving the still living  
For the walking dead  
It took so long  
To find my way out of here  
Out of the warm night, to the hard light  
Shivering with fear  
After you're gone, babies  
Crawling on the world  
Touching the souls of all the lonely  
Carefree boys and girls  
Daddy needs you  
Mamma feeds you  
And they come until they go  
But if I'm lonely, I'm the only one who knows  
It took so long  
To find my way out of here  
Out of the warm night, to the hard light  
Shivering with fear  
After the slow lonely waiting  
I'm all alone, alone and free  
If you see me, please believe me  
I wannna be  
After you're gone, babies  
Screaming at the rain  
Hanging a slow heaven  
In the wind again  
She's been waiting  
270 days  
Sick of waiting  
When you see me  
Please believe me  
I'm the only one who cares at all  
[chorus]  
After the slow lonely heaven  
I'm all alone, alone and free  
If you see me  
Please believe me  
I wanna be  
After you're gone...

(Original by Badfinger )  
  
Guess I got what I deserve,  
Kept you waiting there, too long my love  
All that time, without a word,  
Didn't know you'd think, that I'd forget, or I'd regret  
The special love I have for you, my baby blue  
All the days became so long,  
Did you really think, I'd do you wrong  
Dixie, when I let you go,  
Thought you'd realize, that I would know, I would show  
The special love I have for you, my baby blue  
What can I do, what can I say  
Except that I want you by my side  
How can I show, you, show me a way  
Don't you know, the times I tried (solo)  
Guess that's all I have to say,  
Except the feeling just gets stronger everyday  
Just one thing, before I go  
Take good care, baby, let me know, let it grow  
The special love, you have for me, my Dixie dear

Gonna get out on the road tonight  
Cause, I got a hollow in my head  
Checking it up  
Baby, one more time for you  
Checking it up  
Until the pot hits the sky  
It's like I think  
I'm sick of cocaine  
Got a feeling like  
It's running in my veins  
Checking it up  
Baby, one more time for you  
Checking it up  
Until the pot hits the sky  
Even the best years  
Leave a lot to be desired  
When they pass you by  
All these seasons  
All this time  
Spinning round  
Until they leave you  
Far behind  
Lay me down in the circle  
Where the spotlight shines  
All this pleasure gets me high  
Some people will cut you  
Until you're bleeding  
But not me  
I just want to do it to myself  
Checking it up  
Baby, one more time for you  
Checking it up  
Until the pot hits the sky  
Even the best years  
Are a waste of time  
But, Baby, I'm a big star now  
All these seasons  
All this time  
Spinning round  
Until they leave you  
Far behind  
Lay me down in the circle  
Where the spotlight shines  
All this pleasure gets me high  
All these seasons  
All this time  
Spinning round  
Until they leave you  
Far behind  
Lay me down in the circle  
Where the spotlight shines  
Turn your back back on the people  
Who draw the line  
Put your faith in the answers  
That you can find  
Hit the Ground hard running down  
That highway line  
Say a prayer for the ones  
You have left behind  
All this pleasure gets them high  
I don't want to give it back...

(Original by - Grand Funk Railroad)  
  
I'm in love with a girl  
I'm talking about  
I'm in love with a girl I can't live without  
I'm in love but I sure picked a bad time to be in love  
A bad time to be in love  
Let her be somebody else's queen  
I don't want to know about it  
Too many others who know what I mean  
That's why I got to live without it  
Said I'm in love with a girl  
I'm talking about  
I'm in love with a girl  
I can't live without  
I'm in love  
But I feel like I'm wearing it out  
I'm in love  
But I must have picked a bad time to be in love  
A bad time to be in love  
A bad time to be in love  
A bad time to be in love  
A bad time to be in love  
The story is coming back to me  
From my friends and the people I don't want to see  
The things they're saying I know just couldn't be true  
At least not until I hear it from you  
Cause I love a little girl  
I'm talking about  
I'm in love with a girl  
I can't live without  
I'm in love  
But I feel like I'm wearing it out  
I'm in love  
But I must have picked a bad time to be in love  
A bad time to be in love  
A bad time to be in love  
A bad time to be in love  
Chorus

Fading everything to black and blue  
You look a lot like you  
Shatter in the blink of an eye  
You keep sailing right on through  
Every time you say you're learning  
You just look a lot like me  
Pale under the blistering sky  
White and red  
Black and blue  
You've been waiting a long time  
You've been waiting a long time  
  
To fall down on your knees  
Cut your hands  
Cut yourself until you bleed  
Fall asleep next to me  
Wait for everyone to go away  
And in a dimly lit  
room where you've got nothing to hide  
  
Say your goodbyes  
Tell yourself we'll read  
a note that says  
I'm sorry everyone  
I'm tired of feeling nothing goodbye  
  
Wash your face  
Dry your eyes  
Cause you've been waiting a long time  
You've been waiting a long long time  
To fall down on your knees  
  
Cut your hands  
Cut yourself until you bleed  
But fall asleep next to me  
Have a dream I'm falling down  
  
On my face  
Scrape my knees  
Scrape my hands until they bleed  
Cause you're fast asleep next to me  
Next to me, next to me, next to me

(Original by Willie Nelson)  
  
In the twilight glow I see her  
Blue eyes crying in the rain  
When we kissed goodbye and parted  
I knew we'd never meet again  
Love is like a dying ember  
Only memories remain  
Through the ages I remember  
Blue eyes crying in the rain  
Someday when we meet up yonder  
We'll stroll hand in hand again  
In a land that knows no parting  
Blue eyes crying in the rain  
Blue eyes crying in the rain  
Blue eyes crying in the rain  
Blue eyes crying in the rain

Hey now bulldog  
Don't you rush in  
With your eyes wild  
Hey there big bear  
Take a moment  
To decide  
All these angels together  
Walk the wire line  
Scarecrow angels  
Says the bulldog  
With a smile  
They catch you in a corner  
Shut your eyes  
They come at you at night  
They catch you in a corner  
Shut your eyes  
They come at you at night  
One less bell to warn you..  
One more chance to say goodbye  
I don't I don't I don't think  
I understand you..  
Don't really think I do  
I don't I don't I don't  
.. Think I understand you  
Don't really think I do  
Hey Louise what's the barrier  
Between love and need?  
How far is it from love underneath  
What are you supposed to mean to me  
What do you mean to me?  
They catch you in a corner shut your eyes  
They come at you at night  
They catch you in a corner  
Shut your eyes  
They come at you at night  
One less bell to warn ya one more song to play..  
I'm going back to california  
Your gonna get your chance to say goodbye  
Hey mathew, is anybody mean to you  
And don't you harbor points of view  
Secretly belive in your doom  
I don't think I understand you  
I don't really think I do  
I don't think I understand you  
I don't really think I do  
Well ya got One less bell to warn ya  
One more song to play  
I'm going back to California  
Gonna get your chance to say goodbye  
One less bell to warn ya, one more chance to say goodbye...

(Original by John Hiatt)  
  
My baby's gone and I don't know why  
She let out this morning  
Like a rusty shot in a hollow sky  
Left me without warning  
Sooner than the dogs could bark  
And faster than the sun rose  
Down to the banks in an old mule car  
She took a flatboat across the shallow  
Chorus:  
Left me in my tears to drown  
She left a baby daughter  
Now the water's wide and deep and brown  
She's crossing muddy waters  
Tobacco standing in the fields  
Be rotten come November  
And a bitter heart will not reveal  
A spring that love remembers  
When that sweet brown girl of mine her black eyes are ravens  
We broke the bread and drank the wine  
From a jug that she'd been saving  
Repeat chorus  
Baby's crying and the daylight's gone  
That big oak tree is groaning  
In rush of wind and river of song  
I can hear my sweetheart moaning  
Crying for her baby child  
Or crying for her husband  
Crying for that river's wild  
To take her from her loved ones  
Repeat chorus twice

Waiting for the moon to come and light me up inside  
And I am waiting for the telephone to tell me I'm alive  
Well I heard you let somebody get their fingers into you  
It's getting cold in California  
I guess I'll be leaving soon  
  
Daylight fading  
Come and waste another year  
All the anger and the eloquence are bleeding into fear  
Moonlight creeping around the corners of our lawn  
When we see the early signs that daylight's fading  
We leave just before it's gone  
  
She said "Everybody loves you,"  
She says, "Everybody cares"  
But all the things I keep inside myself  
They vanish in the air  
If you tell me that you'll wait for me  
I'll say I won't be here  
I want to say goodbye to you  
Goodbye to all my friends  
Goodbye to everyone I know  
  
Daylight fading  
Come and waste another year  
All the anger and the eloquence are bleeding into fear  
Moonlight creeping around the corners of our lawn  
When we see the early signs that daylight's fading  
We leave just before it's gone  

Sunday morning paper dated 1992  
There are cowboys in my kitchen  
Empty bottles on the roof  
I've been trying to quit these cigarettes  
I've been trying to think it's true  
Maybe she's gone to California  
Maybe I'll go out there too  
Daylight fading come and waste another year  
All the anger and the elegance are bleeding into fear  
Moonlight creeping round the corners of our lawn  
When she sees the early signs of daylight fading  
She leaves just before it's gone  
Daddy's on the rooftop with his fingers in  
The gun and I am waiting at the window I am  
Waiting for the one  
Shying in that paper when she walked into my room I said I want to  
Say good-bye to you good-bye to all my friends good-bye to everyone I know  
Daylight fading come and waste another year  
All the anger and the elegance are bleeding into fear  
Moonlight creeping round the corners of our lawn  
When she sees the early signs of daylight fading  
She leaves just before it's gone  
Daylight fading come and waste another year  
All the anger and the elegance are bleeding into fear  
Moonlight creeping round the corners of our lawn  
When she sees the early signs of daylight fading  
She leaves just before it's gone

"My turn this time," he says.  
"Never get better than this,  
We never get better than bad. "  
"My turn this time," he said.  
"Now I can do what I want,  
Now I can walk away mad. "  
"Cause last time we tried," he said.  
"We never get anywhere  
We never solve anything. "  
"It's my turn this time," he said.  
And sticks out his chin like a man  
Sticks out his chin like a man  
"My turn this time," they cried.  
And everyone walks in a line  
Around in a circle until they die  
"My turn this time," they scream.  
And diamonds and babies and cars...  
Don't add up to anything  
"My turn this time," she says.  
"I wish we could talk a bit more,  
Just give me a little more time. "  
"My turn this time," she says.  
"My children are growing up mad,  
They never get anywhere. "  
This time she starts to cry  
And everyone stares at the ground  
Nobody says a word  
"You get one chance each life," she sighs.  
"And mine is just passing me by."  
He walks out the door and she stares up at the ceiling  
"My turn this time," they cry.  
And everyone walks in a line  
Around in a circle until they die  
"My turn this time," they scream.  
And diamonds and babies and cars...  
Don't add up to anything, at all  
"My turn this time," he says.  
And he turns the radio on  
And he turns the radio off  
"My turn this time," she says.  
And she laughs at her self  
And she laughs at her self  
And the sun goes down  
And the sun comes up

[Verse:]  
I was an idiot in Utero, somehow miss New Mexico  
Fell to earth in Baltimore, I know  
Now they lay case in empty rooms, birthday cards and red balloons  
And me, I know, I know, I know, I know  
I invited Johnny Legs and Jackie-O  
Empty parties filled with people I don't know  
  
[Chorus:]  
I am rich and in the radio, I dream on my tv  
Dislocation, dislocation  
I'm fading out in stereo, I don't remember me  
Dislocation, dislocation  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Tellin' lies and taking shots, gettin' laid in parking lots  
Gettin' high and gettin' caught, I know  
All my broken paper planes, parachutes and window panes  
I'm a shooting star gone novocaine, I know  
So I write to all the girly magazines  
Splash my passion on the pages in-between  
  
[Chorus:]  
I am rich and in the radio, I dream on my tv  
Dislocation, dislocation  
I'm fading out in stereo, I don't remember me  
Dislocation, dislocation  
  
[Verse 3:]  
Rising from the afterglow, a dodo bird with polio  
And me, I know, I know, I know, I know  
I play with a rock and roll band on a subway  
It keeps me far away from the gamma rays  
We lit between the boom boom crash and the fade away, I know  
Come on wake up the congregation, we will see the light tonight  
The spark the flash the bang the bite  
I know, I know, I know know know know know know know  
  
[Chorus:]  
I am rich and in the radio, I dream on my tv  
Dislocation, dislocation  
I'm fading out in stereo, I don't remember me  
Dislocation, dislocation  
If they dropped a bomb on London, swallow la with the sea  
Dislocation, dislocation  
Say a prayer for Oklahoma say another one for me  
Dislocation, dislocation

I was born again a little north of Disney Land  
Somewhere under Wonderland and Hollywood  
But then I had to go skipping and diving and bouncing back to New York City  
Straight through the heart of America where all the wild things grow  
  
I want to be an earthquake driver  
I want to be an aquarium diver  
I just don't want to go home  
  
I mean, I live alone but I am hungry for affection  
I just struggle with connection til the water calls me home  
Down into ocean among millions of other lonely people  
Drowning among the only people we are ever going to know  
  
I want to be an earthquake driver  
I want to be an aquarium diver  
I just don't want to go home  
  
I want to be like the people I see  
They run all over just like me  
I was saved but what keeps me awake  
Is I'm tied into the lightning line  
And I wanna be where the sun is shining  
All night just a waste of time I, I don't want to see people like me  
Just sleeping in, waking in, hoping in, hating in  
  
You look at me like I'm some kind of carnival attraction  
You say love's this abstraction, just some ghost that you chase  
Well, I am sorry friend, I am a blank space  
But the words you remember from whenever you saw my face  
  
I want to be an earthquake driver  
I don't want to be an aquarium diver  
I just don't want to go home  
  
I want to be like the people I see  
Hey man, they run all over just like me  
I want to thank for what keeps me awake  
This unplugged ears to the lightning lining  
I want to see if the sun is shining  
All night, chasing time I, I don't want to be with people like me  
Just creeping in, waking in, hoping in, hating in  
  
So what is the point of this famous self absorption?  
We turn ourselves into orphans and then spend out nights alone  
Living in fear of some kind of imaginary consequence  
Terror incognito, ob-la-di ob-la-da  
  
I want to be an earthquake driver  
I don't want to be an aquarium diver  
I just don't want to go home  
  
Truth is I don't want to be no earthquake driver  
And I don't want to be an aquarium diver  
I just don't want to go home  
  
Oh man, just don't want to go home  
No, I do not want to go home

I have so many talents  
I'm afraid to show them  
People may not like them  
  
So they're hidden  
Hidden within  
Where no one can hate them!  
Or appreciate them?  
  
I have so many dreams  
I'm afraid to reveal them  
People may not accept them  
  
So they're hidden  
Hidden within  
Where no one can kill them!  
Or fulfill them?  
  
I have so many beautiful thoughts  
I'm afraid to share them  
People may ignore them  
  
So they're hidden  
Hidden within  
Where no one can ignore them!  
Or enjoy them?  
  
I hate to hid  
I hide cause I'm lonely  
I need someone who will expose me  
  
Is it you?

Getting dressed and bunger bound  
Shuffling through the heather  
Neighbors drop their flowers down and worry about the weather  
Every night I'm floating over you my love  
Every night I dream I'm under you  
All the smiling hands delivering all the ???  
All of the smiling men with suede hands delivering with those pensions  
Wont you please except our sympathy into three dimensions  
Every night I'M floating over you my love  
Every night I'm drifting under you  
Don't want to think about my last cigarette  
Don't want to focus on the curve of your thigh  
Don't want to slip off your white silhouette  
I don't think this is a very sensible way to die.  
Lonely lonely lonely  
Lonely lonely lonely  
Lonely lonely lonely  
Lonely lonely lonely  
Every night I'M floating over you my love  
Every night I dream I'm under you  
Well I'm alter bound and under dressed  
Just slightly out of order hanging on the fringe of daylights  
Soft and pitchy border.  
Every night I'm floating over you my love  
Every night I'm slipping under you  
Every night I'm floating over you my love  
Every night I'm dream I'm under you  
Lonely lonely ohh I'M so lonely.

(Original by Townes Van Zandt)  
  
Why does she sing  
Her sad songs for me,  
I'm not the one  
To tenderly bring  
Her soft sympathy  
I've just begun  
To see my way clear  
And it's plain,  
If I stop I will fall  
I can lay down a tear  
For her pain,  
Just a tear and that's all.  
  
What does she want me to do?  
She says that she knows  
That moments are rare  
I suppose that it's true  
Then on she goes  
To say I don't care,  
And she knows  
That I do  
  
Maybe she just has to sing, for the sake of the song  
And who do I think that I am to decide that she's wrong.  
  
She'd like to think that I'm cruel,  
But she knows that's a lie  
For I would be  
No more than a tool  
If I allowed her to cry  
All over me.  
  
Oh my sorrow is real  
Eventhough  
I can't change my plan  
If she could see how I feel  
Then I know  
That she'd understand  
  
Oh does she actually think I'm to blame?  
Does she really believe  
That some word of mine  
Can relieve  
All her pain?  
Can't she see that she grieves  
Just because she's been blindly deceived  
By her shame?  
  
Nothin's what it seems,  
Maybe she'll start someday  
To realize  
If she abandons her dreams,  
Then all the words she can say  
Are only lies  
When will she see  
That to gain  
Is only to lose?  
All that she offers me  
Are her chains,  
I got to refuse  
  
Oh but it's only to herself that she's lied  
She likes to pretend  
It's something that she must defend,  
With her pride  
And I don't intend  
To stand here and be the friend  
From whom she must hide

All I want is something good  
It gets harder every time  
She is leaving here tonight  
Take a breath  
Take your time  
Spread your wings and rise  
  
Make a mark upon the wall  
Paint your face and pass the time  
Close your eyes and she ascends  
Hold your breath and ease your mind  
Forty Thousand times  
Time fades into the night  
  
They descend and then they climb  
Feathers falling through the night  
Have you seen Ohio rise?  
It has been four days and nights  
  
All I want is something fine  
It gets harder every time  
She is sleeping far away  
Take a breath  
Take your time  
Spread your wings and rise  
Rise into the black Ohio skies  

She had four white stallions coming up around the bend  
Four strong angels at her command to send  
Four more seasons, for all that's broken to mend  
  
I got four good reasons why I can't go back there again  
  
She had skin like a statue, milky white and pure  
Carved by an artist whose hand is demure  
Got a mind like a sabre  
Razor sharp and sure  
  
God how I hate myself for still wanting her  
  
Tell me it's nicer dreaming, visions soft and sure  
No way to find there's nothing left to me and her  
Nothing more but a heart still at war  
  
She had four white stallions coming up around the bend  
Four strong angels already sent  
Four more seasons for all that's broken to mend  
  
She had four more seasons wrong, broken to mend  
And I got four good reasons why I can't go back there again

I took the cannonball down to the ocean  
Across the desert from sea to shining sea  
I rode a ladder that climbs across the nation  
Fifty million feet of earth between the buried and me  
  
"How do you do?"  
She said, "Hey, how do you do?"  
  
She buys a ticket 'cause it's cold where she comes from  
She climbs aboard because she's scared of getting older in the snow  
Love is a ghost train rumbling through the darkness  
Hold on to me darling I've got nowhere else to go  
  
"How do you do?"  
She said, "How do you do?"  
  
I took the cannonball down to the ocean  
Watched the diesel disappear beneath the tumbling waves  
Love is a ghost train howling on the radio  
"Remember everything." she said, "when only memory remains."  
  
"How do you do?"  
She said, "Hey, how do you do?"  

Close the door on a short night  
Lift the lid on the daylight  
6: 09 West Tennessee time  
And I buy all my days  
  
At the same place where the girl sells her nights  
To a God of ocean tides.  
  
All night long,  
Writing poems to California  
Melodies of failure  
And the people I have thrown away  
Meanwhile, somewhere west of Carolina  
In a congregation of strangers  
We are digging holes to China  
Then we pray to our reflections  
In the water when it rises.  
  
I said headlights pin the highway down  
Jesus spins the world around  
And I'll spend all my tomorrows coming down  
Goodbye all my days.  
I know I said I never loved you  
But I might just try again tonight.  
  
Truck stops and river Gods  
Gas stations of the Cross  
Following a ghost,  
Following a ghost,  
I pray the water wash away  
The memories and the cost.  
  
Cary me south, to the sea  
Along with your memories of me  
We are born in the water  
Now we return to Thee.  
Colored lights  
And birthday cakes  
Candle wax  
On paper plates.  
  
Breathe the water  
Hush-a-bye, hush-a-bye.  
You can see through water  
All the way up to the sky.  
  
Gods of water, Gods of rain  
Cover up the sun again  
We are crossing it at the Mississippi line  
And I tried all my days  
To love you just the way you hoped I might,  
But I'm leaving here tonight.  
I can't remember yesterday  
I tried, if I said I could I lied.

Well I feel just like a freight train baby,  
Running out of steam.  
I wanna go on down to New York town,  
But I'm stuck in between.  
And I could stay on here at home alone  
And have myself to thank,  
But I just made a billion dollars  
And I don't wanna put it in the bank,  
So if you call...  
We could go to town.  
Well dear mom,  
If you could see me now here underneath the lights  
I gotta keep 'em on from dusk to dawn  
And everything's alright.  
I met a girl with autumn in her eyes  
And summer in the way  
She makes me feel  
Like I was only born today or yesterday,  
And if she calls...  
We could go to town.  
But everybody here  
Hates everything I say,  
And girl I just don't know  
If I can last another day.  
So I guess I'm going back,  
Back where I belong,  
I hope you come along  
Before I get back on that train that takes me...  
Home from New York City  
To the things I left behind  
And 'though I ain't got no money girl  
, I'll always have the time.  
But I wish that you would hurry,  
I hope you get here soon  
'cause I just sold the sky to the sun  
So I could buy for you the moon.  
And if you call...  
We could go to town. So if you call...  
Yeah, if you call...  
Girl, if you call...  
We could go to town.

Larry's in vegas..with some chick from La  
The best things are sevens and sex is just ok so please stay  
She said just stay  
Cause there's a show at 11 and the drinks are all free you can do  
Better for yourself but not me ....  
...so please stay and keep me company.  
All the while thinking this is the good luck, stays with her most of the time  
Takes time to make these machines work, people are so unkind  
Gets kinda nervous  
Used to be hard.  
She takes the edges off evenings in bedrooms and back seats in big cars.  
All the while thinking this is the good luck stays with her most of the time  
It takes time to make these machines work people are so unkind.  
People are so unkind  
She looks in the mirror  
To make she's here  
She keeps disappearing and dreaming of movie stars- weddings and nothing is
happening  
He tries not to notice  
She thinks he doesn't care.  
Capture yourself in a jar and you stay there,  
Until you vanish  
Thin air  
All the while thinking this is the good luck stays with her most of the time  
It takes time to make these machines work but he aint got time while  
She's riding in black cars and pokes at the sky to see if he can make stars
and  
People are so unkind  
People are so unkind..  
People are so unkind..  
People are so unkind...  
People are so unkind  
People are so..  
UN  
KIND..

The gentleman caller in the blue suede shoes  
He don't know what to do  
He just wants to look good for you  
So he rushes in to tell you what he did today  
But he can't think of what to say  
I think you listen anyway  
  
He wants to have a good time just like everybody  
He doesn't want to fall apart  
  
You watch him as he stutters over what to say  
It's just a little game you play  
It's no easier for you some days  
You wish that you could tell him it'll be okay  
But you feel a little shy these days  
Cause everybody goes away  
  
You just want to have a good time  
Just like everybody else  
You don't want to fall apart this time  
  
I can look into your eyes and see the  
mess we're in  
Well darling, if it's shit came out  
Then I suppose it's shit went in  
Even though I couldn't say I've been the  
places you've been  
You know he made my heart real strong  
Even if he made my head real thin  
  
I want to have a good time  
Just like everybody  
And I don't want to fall apart  
  
I just want to have a good time  
Just like everybody else  
And I don't want to fall apart this time  
So would you please invite me in  
  
I really love the red haired girls  
I'm just another boy from Texas  
Come on and take a spin  
I got a brand new set of wings

I said, "Goodnight L.A."  
Cause I'm awake in my room  
I been up for thirty eight hours  
And it don't look like sleep's coming soon  
  
Cause I could break like a bird  
Or I could swallow the sea  
It seems like the daylight is coming  
And no one is watching but me  
  
But I don't mind the dark discovering the day  
Cause the night  
Is a beautiful bright blue and grey  
  
And what brings me down now is love  
Cause I can never get enough  
  
And it's a dangerous time for a heart on a wire  
Shuttled from station to station noisily  
Now knowing why  
  
So I put my head on the ground  
And the sky is a wheel  
Spinning these days into things that I've lost  
But you can keep all the years  
  
But I don't mind the days gone rolling away  
Cause this sunlight  
Feels warm on my face today  
  
And what brings me down now is love  
Cause I can never get enough of love

She sat right down on the sofa  
And said, "Where have you been, I've been waiting for you"  
'Cause last night I had something so good  
These days get so long and I got nothin' to do  
  
I've been hanging around this town on a corner  
I've been bummin' around this old town so long  
I've been hanging around this town on a corner  
I've been bummin' around this old town for way too long  
  
We spent all day gettin' sober  
Just hiding from daylight, watching tv, fading away  
We just look a lot better in the blue light  
Well you know I gotta get out but I'm stuck so tight  
Weighed by the chains that keep me  
  
Hanging around this town on a corner  
I've been bummin' around this old town too long  
I've been hanging around this town on a corner  
I've been bummin' around this old town for way too long  
Well everybody trip  
  
You know man, I'm just, I'm just  
I'm just tryin' to scurry up a little  
  
This girl listens to the band play she says, "Where have you been?  
I been lyin' right here on the floor, right here on the floor"  
Well I got all this time to be waiting for what is mine to be hated  
What I am after the light has faded  
  
Hangin' around this town on a corner  
I've been bummin' around this old town so long  
I've been hanging around this town on a corner  
I've been bummin' around this old town for way too, way  
  
I've been hanging around this town on a corner  
I've been bummin' around this old town for way too long  
I've been hanging around this town on a corner  
I've been bummin' around this old town for way  
Way, way, way, way too long  
  
Way, way, way, way too long  
Way, way, way, way too long  
Way, way, way, way too long  
Way, way, way, way too long  
Way, way, way, way too long  
Way, way, way, way too long

She brings her friends so we wont have to be alone  
Fear I might lose my composure without warning  
I am a child of fire I am a lion I have desires  
And I was born inside the sun this morning  
  
[Chorus]  
This dizzy life of mine keeps hanging me up all the time  
This dizzy life is just a hanging tree  
This dizzy life of mine keeps hanging me up all the time  
This dizzy life is just a hanging tree  
  
They say good evening when they don't know what to say  
They say good morning when they wish you would go home  
  
You open windows and you wait for someone warm to come inside and then freeze
to death alone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
She calls a waitress when its time for her to go  
And I know everyone is eventually leaving  
I got a pair of wings for my birthday baby and I will fall down through the
sun to see you mine  
  
[Chorus]  
  
For me, for me, for me [Repeated]  
  
This dizzy life is just a hanging tree  
This dizzy life is just a hanging tree for me  
  
This dizzy life is just a hanging tree for me  
For me, for me, for me [Repeated]  
  
This dizzy life is just a hanging tree for me

On certain Sundays in November  
When the weather bothers me  
I empty drawers of other summers  
Where my shadows used to be  
And she is standing by the water  
As her smile begins to curl  
In this or any other summer  
She is something altogether different  
Never just an ordinary girl  
  
And in the evenings on Long Island  
When the colors start to fade  
She wears a silly yellow hat  
That someone gave her when she stayed  
I didn't think that she returned it  
We left New York in a whirl  
Time expands and then contracts  
When you are spinning in the grip of someone  
Who is not an ordinary girl  
  
And when you sleep you find your mother in the night  
But she stays just out of sight  
So there isn't any sweetness in the dreaming  
And when you wake the morning covers you with light  
And it makes you feel alright  
But it's just the same hard candy you're  
remembering again  
  
You send your lover off to China  
And you wait for her to call  
You put your girl up on a pedestal  
Then you wait for her to fall  
I put my summers back in a letter  
And I hide it from the world  
All the regrets you can't forget  
Are somehow pressed upon a picture  
In the face of such an ordinary girl  
  
And when you sleep you find your mother in the night  
But she fades just out of sight  
So there isn't any sweetness in the dreaming  
And when you wake  
The morning showers you with light  
And it makes you feel alright  
But it's just the same hard candy you're  
remembering again

Get away from me  
This isn't gonna be easy  
But I don't need you  
Believe me  
You got a piece of me  
But it's just a little piece of me  
And I don't need anyone  
And these days I feel like I'm fading away  
Like sometimes when I hear myself on the radio  
  
Have you seen me lately?  
  
I was out on the radio starting to change  
Somewhere out in America  
It's starting to rain  
Could you tell me the things you remember about me  
And have you seen me lately?  
  
I remember me  
And all the little things  
That make up a memory  
Like she said she loved to watch me sleep  
Like she said,  
"It's the breathing  
It's the breathing in and out and in and..."  
  
Have you seen me lately?  

Get away from me  
Get away from me  
This isn't gonna be easy,  
But I don't need you believe me  
Yeah you got a piece of me,  
But it's just a little piece of me  
I don't need anyone these days  
I feel like I'm fading away  
Like sometimes when I hear myself on the radio  
  
Have you seen me lately?  
Have you seen me lately?  
Have you seen me lately?  
  
I was out on the radio  
Starting to change somewhere out in America  
It's raining  
Could you tell me one thing you remember about me  
Remember about me  
  
I remember me  
All the little things that make up a memory  
She said she loved to watch me sleep  
She says, "It's the breathing"  
"It's the breathing in and out and in and out"  
  
Have you seen me lately?  
Have you seen me lately?  
Have you seen me lately?  
  
I was out on the radio  
Starting to change somewhere out in America  
It's raining  
Could you tell me one thing you remember about me?  
Remember about me  
Remember about me  
  
You know I thought someone would notice  
I thought somebody would say something if I was missing  
Well can't you see me?  
Come on color me in  
Come on color me in  
Come on, Come on, Come on  
Give me a blue rain  
Give me a black sky  
Give me your green eyes  
Just give me your white skin  
Give me your white skin  
Give me your white skin  
  
I was out on the radio  
Starting to change somewhere out in America  
It's raining  
Could you tell me one thing you remember about me?  
Just one thing you Remember about me  
Just one thing you Remember about me  
One thing you remember about me  
Remember about me

When you disapear on me it's like parades in the rain,  
Every time I see you, you just disapear again.  
Every time your leavin' I don't know what to say.  
I wanna see all that damn go away.  
  
So would you tell me, why your leavin'  
'Cause' I don't know why it has to be so.  
So could you tell me? Why your leavin'?  
'Cause I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.  
  
All this everlasting love songs, come into my eyes.  
Every time I see you. I'm alive. I'm alive.  
  
So could you tell me, why your leavin'  
'Cause I don't know why it has to be so.  
So could you tell me? Why your leavin'?  
'Cause I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know. I don't know

Here comes that feeling again  
You're always around me  
This island life never ends  
It just circles inside me  
And when we're older  
We'll go back to being friends  
But oh,  
Here comes that feeling again  
I better get away from all these  
Oh-so-familar places that I see  
I gotta find a place without so many  
Familar faces in front of me  
When I wake up in the morning  
And there's no one there but me  
I'll remember  
I'll remember  
Here comes that feeling again  
You're always around me  
This island life never ends  
It just circles inside me  
And when we're older  
We'll go back to being friends  
But oh,  
Here comes that feeling again  
Gotta keep on moving through these  
Distances between yesterday and now  
As if all this riding on these white lines  
Will make them fade away somehow  
Do you try not to remember  
The things you cannot forget  
And are you sorry for what hasn't happened yet  
I stare at everyone  
It makes me wonder why  
I can't see anyone but you  
Maybe change  
And all these faces  
Reappear in different places  
And I can't see a thing but you  
Here comes that feeling again  
You're always around me  
This island life never ends  
It just circles inside me  
And when we're older  
We'll go back to being friends  
But oh,  
Here comes that feeling again

All my friends got flowers in their eyes  
But I got none this season  
All of last years blooms have gone and died  
Time doesn't give a reason  
Hey baby, do you ask yourself sometimes  
What you need to be forgiven?  
Everything that you've ever done wrong  
Is the reason that I'm driven  
Straight to you  
  
Waiting here for you  
Wanting to tell you  
How I get my ends and my beginnings mixed up too  
Just the way you do  
Thought if I told you  
You might want to stay for just another day or two  
  
Waiting for the trains that just never come  
Beginning to believe in  
the disappearing nature of the people we have been  
We have begun to change into the worst kind of people  
So unkind  
Oh apologies, no apologies, this apology  
Doesn't describe the way it feels to feel for you  
  
Waiting here for you  
Wanting to tell you  
How I find myself slowly disappearing too  
Just the way you do  
Thought if I told you  
You might want to help me to remain with you  
  
I just wanna stay for a little while  
I wanna stay for a little while  
  
There's a night life falling down on me  
I just feel like a change  
Beneath the sun in the summer,  
a sea of flowers won't bloom without the rain  
But oh, this desert life, this high life  
Here at the dying end of the day  
I wasn't made for this scene baby  
But I was made in this scene  
And baby it's just my way  
I don't wanna go home alone, I wanna come on home to you  
  
Waiting here for you  
Wanting to tell you  
How I line my sky with all the silver I can use  
Just the way you do  
Thought if I told you  
You might want to stay for just another day or two  

Got no place to go  
But there's a girl waiting for me down in Mexico  
She got a bottle of tequila, a bottle of gin  
And if I bring a little music I could fit right in  
  
We got airplane rides  
We got California drowning out the window side  
We've got big black cars  
And we got stories how we slept with all the  
Movie stars  
  
I may take a holiday in Spain  
Leave my wings behind me  
Drink my worries down the drain  
And fly away to somewhere new  
  
Hop on my choo-choo  
I'll be your engine driver in a bunny suit  
If you dress me up in pink and white  
We may be just a little fuzzy 'bout it later tonight  
  
She's my angel  
She's a little better than the one that used to be with me  
Cause she liked to scream at me  
Man, it's a miracle that she's not living up in a tree  
  
I may take a holiday in Spain  
Leave my wings behind me  
Drive this little girl insane  
And fly away to someone new  
  
Everybody's gone  
They left the television screaming that the radio's on  
Someone stole my shoes  
But there's a couple of bananas  
And a bottle of booze  
  
Oh well, happy new year's baby!  
We could probably fix it if we clean it up all day  
Or we could simply pack our bags  
And catch a plane to Barcelona 'cause this city's a drag  
  
I may take a holiday in Spain  
Leave my wings behind me  
Flush my worries down the drain  
And fly away to somewhere new  
  
Take a holiday in Spain  
Leave my wings behind me  
Drive this little girl insane  
Fly away to someone new  
Fly away to someone new  
Fly away to someone new

Hospital bound, so you know there will be treatment  
Hey alright, it's too late to put up a fight  
Hospital gowns, so you know you should be sleeping  
Wide awake, there's some pills that you shouldn't take  
  
Honest to God, X is always an unknown  
I said alright, Y gets buried in your bones  
I said honest to God, if you don't get it off your chest  
You don't have to stay around, you don't have to solve for X  
  
I'm afraid I found it's eternally unequal  
Hey alright, it's too late to put up a fight  
On the way back down, finally a sequel,  
Hey alright, in a hospital room tonight  
  
Is it alright, and your exit's always an unknown  
It's hard to hold on too tight, 'cause I got buried with your bones  
And I said honest to God, if you don't get it off your chest  
All your reason gone tonight, you don't have to solve for X  
  
Hospital bound, so you know there will be treatment  
Hey alright, in a hospital room tonight  
Hospital gowns, so you know you should be sleeping  
Wide awake, there's some pills that I shouldn't take  
  
And I said alright, X is always an unknown  
I tried to hold on too tight but I got buried with the bone  
And I said honest to God, I got to get it off my chest  
I don't want to stick around, 'cause I don't need this suffering

You can still come and make me coffee in the mornin  
You can still come and cook me chicken fried steak  
You can live your life with whomever you please to,  
As long as someone takes good care of me  
You know I don't mind.  
How can I live without you  
If it means I gotta get a job?  
You could still come, bring me those fancy pastries.  
You can still come round, crawl into my bed.  
You can live your life with whomever you please to,  
As long as someone takes good care of me  
You know I don't mind.  
How can I live without you  
If it means I gotta get a job?

Twenty-twenty-twenty four hours to go  
I wanna be sedated  
Nothing to do  
Nowhere to go  
I wanna be sedated  
Just get me to the airport  
And put me in a plane  
Hurry hurry hurry before I go insane  
I can't control my fingers  
I can't control my brain  
Oh no oh ho  
Twenty-twenty-twenty four hours to go  
I wanna be sedated  
Nothing to do  
Nowhere to go  
I wanna be sedated  
Just put me in a wheelchair  
And get me to the show  
Hurry hurry hurry before I go loco  
I can't control my fingers  
I can't control my toes  
Oh no oh ho

The devil's in the dreaming  
He tells you I'm not sleeping in my hotel room alone  
With nothing to believe in  
You dive into the traffic rising up  
And it's so quiet  
You're surprised  
And then you wake  
  
For all the things you're losing  
You might as well resign yourself to try and make a change  
I'm going down to Hollywood  
They're gonna make a movie from the things that they find  
crawling round my brain  
  
I wish I was a girl so that you could believe me  
And I could shake this static everytime I try to sleep  
I wish for all the world that I could say,  
"Hey Elizabeth, you know, I'm doing alright these days."  
  
The devil's in the dreaming  
You see yourself descending from a building to the ground  
You watch the sky receding  
You spin to see the traffic rising up  
And it's so quiet  
You're surprised  
And then you wake  
  
For all the things I'm losing  
I might as well resign myself to try and make a change  
But I'm going down to Hollywood  
They're gonna make a movie from the things that they find  
crawling round my brain  
  
I wish I was a girl so that you could believe me  
And I could shake this static every time I try to sleep  
I wish for all the world that I could say,  
"Hey Elizabeth, you know, I'm doing alright these days."  
  
In one of these dreams, you forgive me  
It makes me think of the bad decisions that keep you at home  
How could anyone else have changed?  
All these wrong conclusions that leave you alone  
How could everyone rearrange?  
How could everyone else have changed?  
What I see I believe  
  
For all the things I'm losing  
I might as well resign myself to try and make a change  
Well, I'm going down to Hollywood  
They're gonna make a movie from the things that they find  
crawling around my brain  
  
I wish I was a girl so that you could believe me  
And I could shake this static everytime I try to sleep  
I wish for all the world that I could say,  
"Hey Elizabeth, you know, I'm doing alright these days."  
  
But I can't sleep at night  

Happy birthday baby  
What's it gonna be  
Monday morning' with a hurricane warning'  
Oh well, I guess you've got yourself to please  
Jaded. Faded.  
I don't wanna be afraid.  
Jaded. I hate it.  
I don't wanna be your slave.  
Saw you peeking' round my garden gate  
I thought you'd liked what you'd seen  
So I said, "Darlin' if you want a little of these peaches,  
Just come on and shake my tree. "  
Jaded. Faded.  
I don't wanna be your slave.  
Jaded. I hate it.  
I don't wanna be afraid.  
Every waking' hour  
We break down in different combinations.  
We spin around in smaller constellations.  
Took a ride on the love wheel  
Scary, scary go-round and around.  
Honey, Honey I don't want none of your money.  
I just want off before we hit the ground.  
Jaded. Faded.  
I don't wanna be your friend.  
Jaded. I hate it.  
I don't wanna be your slave.  
Saw you hangin' around the avenue baby  
So I got down outta my tree.  
I think I need a little animal honey.  
Come on and shake a little monkey with me.  
Jaded. Faded.  
Oh. I don't wanna be afraid.  
Jaded. I hate it.  
I don't wanna be your slave  
Every waking' hour  
We break down in smaller combinations.  
We spin around in different constellations.  
Wanna be right there to carry you away  
Knowing that our love will last through the day.  
It's the same thing.  
Gonna be here on the light, on the light  
I wanna see me, see me going away  
I've been gone such a long time.  
Leaving' again today.  
Leaving' someday.

[Verse:]  
I snook out the front door into winter and the world outside  
I stepped out the door to New York City, my hair was barely dry  
I could not remember where I was going, so I went back inside  
Nothin' happened in the elevator, nothing happening on the stairs  
Nothing ever happenin' when I am sleeping and I cannot stay there  
How'd you find a party when you're in your room?  
How'd you find the action man? The action is everywhere!  
And decide to climb outside your bedroom window, paint a picture on a clock  
Oh if you decide that you can't hide inside your mind  
Provide the slide to get you out  
Feels just like you're fallin' and you're goin' down  
And everybody luvs ya when you hit the ground  
I say a prayer, I say a prayer, I say a prayer to Pocahontas  
I pray to John Appleseed  
Oh, I cigarette the winter air, then I finna stare my way down 7th street  
Some chick yells Jesus luvs me more than I know but less than I need  
I play down the valley to the? And then I step off into the air  
Point my sunglasses east towards Jerusalem and then follow all the pharoahs
there  
They're buildin' pyramids in the Western Square  
Drivin' in circles 'round the circus til the circles in the air  
My love says come on Adam tell me what the hell is wrong with you  
She says, come on, Adam tell me, what the hell am I supposed to do!  
She says I could love you, I could leave you  
But I can't live what you put me through  
I call the winter Maria cuz I do not know her face  
I call the endless sky Emilia cuz she stays with me from place to place  
I call the sun my love Emanuel, she cradle me in her embrace  
I left, nothin' happening in the kitchen, nothing happening on the floor  
Nothin' happenin' in my bed, she don't sleep there no more  
Hard to find the bottom when you're in the air  
Hey man, how'd you find the circus, we have the circus is everywhere?

Jumpin Jesus my oh my  
He's got a great big bottle of sunshine  
Jumpin Jesus why oh why  
Take the time to get inside  
To get inside  
  
So what's a wall with so much yellow for?  
I don't know what it's for  
So what's a wall has so much yellow for?  
I don't know what it's for  
  
Jumpin Jesus my oh my  
He's got a great big bottle of sunshine  
Jumpin Jesus why oh why  
Take the time to get inside  
To get inside get inside get inside get inside get inside  
  
Arm and hammer and Odessa lives with his wife  
And his child on a house boat  
He likes sunflowers and big picture frames and Van Gogh  
Jumpin Jesus my oh my  
He's got a great big bottle of sunshine  
Jumpin Jesus why oh why  
Take the time to get inside  
To get inside get inside get inside get inside get inside  
Na na na na na na na na  
Lala la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la laaaaa laaaa laaaa

What's there that makes you want to be lonely?  
What's there to keep you sitting at home?  
He'd always say no, no, no  
As if he wanted you to be hungry  
Well, the same things you're missing  
Could get you into something else  
Better leave when to stay  
Is only nothing but being alone  
What I wanted you to know is kid things  
Seemed like nothing at all  
Kid things make it better than it was  
Kid things seemed like nothing at all  
But kid things make it better than it was  
Hey, what you got that makes you want to be lonely?  
Hey, what you got that makes it a better way to be?  
She said no, no, no  
I can't get any love and it's a Sunday  
I said oh, yeah  
What makes you think I wanted it that way?  
'Cause one or two more smiles from you  
And I don't need anything else  
What I wanted you to know is kid things  
Seemed like nothing at all  
Kid things make it better than it was  
We're just kids  
We spend all night on the phone  
It's a kid thing  
But I sleep better when I'm not alone  
What I want right now is just some more  
Gimme more, hey what you think  
Is you're not getting any younger  
What I know is that you're not really very old  
I know you wanna say no, no, no  
It feels much better in the summer  
Well, if it isn't warm where you're sittin'  
Then kitten come on in out of the cold  
'Cause all I know is when I'm with you  
Well, I don't need anything else  
What I wanted you to know is kid things  
Seemed like nothing at all  
And kid things make it better than it was  
We're just kids  
We spend all night on the phone  
It's a kid thing  
So I sleep better when I'm not alone  
Kid things seemed like nothing at all  
Kid things make it better than it was  
We're just kids, just like driving a car  
It's a kid thing and the further out  
The closer in you are  

Wasted time running scared, when all of love needs is to be believed in  
All those springs come and gone,  
Passed like trains and box cars, leaving  
But I would be lying if I didn't tell you the truth  
They will leave you, they will leave you  
  
So come now, let's go dance to the siren's song  
Come now, leave your damage behind and gone  
Some are lost to you,  
  
Wasted time running scared all I need is to believe in  
Something like a summer and I know you need somebody just like I do  
And all of these foxes go down in there barrel to hide  
They will leave you, they will leave you behind  
  
So come now, let's go dance to the siren's song  
Come now, leave damage behind and gone  
So come now, let's go down to the dance floor  
Come now, lose your mind at Le Ballet Do'r  
Some are lost, some are leaving, some are lost, some are leaving  
But I'm not gone at all, I'm not going anywhere at all  
Some are lost to you,  
Wasted time running scared now autumns fire is ashes on the breeze  
And it spends away like dust on pearls as winter comes to usher in the evening  
All of these drummers go stand on the hillside alone  
They will leave you, they will leave you at home  
  
So come home now, lets go dance to the siren's song  
Come now, leave your damage behind and gone  
So come now, let's go down to eh dance floor  
Come now, loose your mind at Le Ballet Do'r  
So come now, Come now, let's get out while the getting's good  
Just come now, there's no one left in the neighborhood

I woke up wednesday morning  
Sometime wednesday evening  
Just looking for a piece of something  
Easy to believe  
  
When you live out on the border  
Of everything and nothing  
There's nothing but waking  
And then dreaming  
  
Barely out of tuesday  
No one to receive me  
And nothing is changin  
  
Maybe you could leave a light on  
Maybe you could leave a light on  
Maybe you could leave a light on..  
For me  
Ohh  
Can you see her  
Waiting there,  
Down by the sea?  
  
See look, I know theres a light on  
Theres no one there for me  
Oh if you see me you see me coming home  
Just turn me away  
  
Cause everybody tries to go back somewhere some day  
So just leave a light on  
Everybody tires to go back somewhere some day  
  
Just leave a light on  
For me  
So that I can see  
Just leave a light for me  
So that  
So that  
Maybe I can see  
  
Cause there's a girl in a car out in the parking lot  
And she says man, c'mon,  
Just take a shot  
  
She says  
Can't you see me?  
Can't you see me?  
Can't you see my walls come tumbling down?  
Said can't you see them crumbling down on me?  
Can't you see?  
Can you see?

Its crazy but often clear often clear..  
We shimmer and disappear  
In color in black and white black and white..  
We slowly fade out of site  
But these days were lit by lightning thin lines of light  
Its crazy but somehow clear somehow clear  
We ride in silence out of fear  
We've spoken seem come alive come alive  
We prefer the silence of the blind  
But these days were lit by lightning  
Thin lines of light  
These days  
Were lit by lines  
Of sharp  
White  
Shock  
White  
Ice  
Hard  
Cold  
White  
Light  
Were crazy but often kind often kind  
We rage in violence blind  
Together and then alone then alone  
We race in small circles home  
But these days  
Were lit by lightning  
Thin lines of light  
These days  
Were lit by lines of sharp  
White  
Light  
These days  
Were lit by lightning  
Thin lines of light..... These days.. were lit by light

(Original by Oasis)  
Sung as an intro to A Long December  
  
Maybe I don't really want to know  
How your garden grows  
'cause I just want to fly  
Lately did you ever feel the pain  
In the morning rain  
As it soaks you to the bone  
Maybe I just want to fly  
I want to live I don't want to die  
Maybe I just want to breathe  
Maybe I just don't believe  
Maybe you're the same as me  
We see things they'll never see  
You and I are gonna live forever  
I said  
Maybe I don't really want to know  
How your garden grows  
'cause I just want to fly  
Lately did you ever feel the pain  
In the morning rain  
As it soaks you to the bone  
Maybe I will never be  
All the things that I want to be  
Now is not the time to cry  
Now's the time to find out why  
I think you're the same as me  
We see things they'll never see  
You and I are gonna live forever  
Maybe I don't really want to know  
How your garden grows  
'cause I just want to fly  
Lately did you ever feel the pain  
In the morning rain  
As it soaks you to the bone  
Maybe I just want to fly  
I want to live I don't want to die  
Maybe I just want to breathe  
Maybe I just don't believe  
Maybe you're the same as me  
We see things they'll never see  
You and I are gonna live forever  
Gonna live forever  
Gonna live forever  
Gonna live forever  
Gonna live forever  
Gonna live forever  
Gonna live forever

Dancing like the nights are down in nashville  
But I seem to know the ghosts who like to run  
I got a call to go to a late night picture show  
So I traded in the darkness and I'm already there  
I'm already there  
  
[Chorus]  
And I'm tryin' to make some friends  
So if you see that movie star and me  
If you see my picture in a magazine  
  
Or if you fall asleep by the bedroom TV  
  
Well honey I'm just tryin' to make some sense  
Outta' me  
  
I left a lot of ghosts in San Francisco  
And now you wanna say you see through me  
But what you wanna see ain't your memories of me  
So why you turn around tonight  
But I'm already there  
I'm already there  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Or if you fall asleep while you're watching TV  
  
Well honey I'm just trying to make some sense  
Los Angeles  
Boston gets cold this time of year  
Seems like each day just leaves me numb  
I gotta get out of here  
Go walking in the sun  
  
Well if you see that movie star and me  
Or if you should see my picture in a magazine  
Or if you fall asleep by the bedroom TV  
  
But honey I'm just trying to make some sense  
Honey I'm just trying to make some friends  
Well baby I'm not trying to make amends  
For coming to Los Angeles  
Oh Los Angeles  
  
No more Boston, no more Nashville, no more Oakland  
Oh baby come on out to the sea  
Come on take a walk down Sunset with me  
  
Oh we gonna get drunk, find up some skinny girls, and go street walking  
In Los Angeles!  
  
And man its a really good place to find yourself a taco

In the still water she lies down  
Shaking through the press of sunlight  
We rolled into Lexington  
She shakes off the drop of daylight  
Water beading up her chest  
Bleeding down between her knees  
Rivers in Kentucky flow  
Between the bluegrass wavy seas  
But oh, Margery  
Twists the knife once more inside of me  
Breathless with anticipation  
Baited reelers set their hooks  
Tuck their heads beneath the high grass  
And lie and wait beside the brooks  
We're infants pushing slowly through  
Frustration leading back along  
The alleys of a childhood  
That will not release us willingly  
But oh, Margery ..sticks the knife in while I couldn't see (strait into me
baby)  
Dust me off and shut me down  
And dream of where I haven't been  
Close the door inside my heart  
Stuck in the south Atlantic wind  
I have hollow eyes  
Haunting only to myself  
Even so, I can't stop calling  
These great big hollows in myself  
I took the train from California  
To the far side of the continent  
Woke up in Kentucky  
Where a wedding was about to end  
I looked up at Anna  
She turned back to look at me  
It's best to kill the ones that matter  
Render blind the ones who see  
But oh, Margery  
Takes the blade and walks away from me  
Oh, Margery  
Love like blood is pouring out of me  
Oh, Margery  
My heart won't stop bleeding over me baby  
Oh, I can't shut it in  
It's got far too many doors to block the wind  
Oh, I can't shut it in

I got a feeling  
Of unrighteousness  
Bitter cold  
Hollow bitterness  
Down the road  
I walk with loneliness  
Mercy will follow me I'm told  
  
My sister sang  
A song so sweet and sad  
About a man  
Whose love I never had  
But there is a train  
Bound for Gilliad  
And mercy will follow me, I'm told  
  
Mercy will you follow me  
Mercy will you follow me  
To my final breath, the last I take  
Mercy will you follow me  
Mercy will you follow me  
Till the chains of this old world I finally break  
  
Under this skin  
There lies a heart of stone  
It's growing old  
So very far from home  
But a heart of gold  
I may one day own  
And mercy will follow me, I'm told  
  
Mercy will you follow me  
Mercy will you follow me  
Till my final breath, the last I take  
Mercy will you follow me  
Mercy will you follow me  
Till the chains of this old world I finally break, oh  
Till the chains of this old world I finally break, oh  
Till the chains of this old world I finally break

I guess I think I feel alright  
You come circling through the light  
The skyline is bright tonight  
What more perfect rendezvous?  
The sundown paints the shadows through  
The daylight, Amy, on what we do  
  
It looks like darkness to me  
Drifting down into Miami  
  
Can I say,  
"I wish that this weather would never leave"?  
It just gets hard to believe  
That god sent this angel to watch over me  
Cause my angel  
She don't receive my calls  
Says I'm to dumb to,  
To dumb to fight  
To dumb to save  
Well, maybe I don't need no angel at all  
  
It looks like darkness to me  
Drifting down into Miami  
She could pull the sunlight through me  
Coming down into Miami  
  
Make a circle in the sand  
Make a halo with your hands  
I'll make a place for you to land  
  
The bus is running  
It's time to leave  
The summer's gone  
And so are we  
So come on baby,  
Let's go shut it down in New Orleans.

I was down at the New Amsterdam staring at this yellow-haired girl  
Mr. Jones strikes up a conversation with this black-haired flamenco dancer  
She dances while his father plays guitar  
She's suddenly beautiful  
We all want something beautiful  
I wish I was beautiful  
So come dance this silence down through the morning  
Cut Maria! Show me some of them Spanish dances  
Pass me a bottle, Mr. Jones  
Believe in me  
Help me believe in anything  
I want to be someone who believes  
  
Mr. Jones and me tell each other fairy tales  
Stare at the beautiful women  
"She's looking at you. Ah, no, no, she's looking at me."  
Smiling in the bright lights  
Coming through in stereo  
When everybody loves you, you can never be lonely  
  
I will paint my picture  
Paint myself in blue and red and black and gray  
All of the beautiful colors are very very meaningful  
Grey is my favorite color  
I felt so symbolic yesterday  
If I knew Picasso  
I would buy myself a gray guitar and play  
  
Mr. Jones and me look into the future  
Stare at the beautiful women  
"She's looking at you.  
Uh, I don't think so. She's looking at me."  
Standing in the spotlight  
I bought myself a gray guitar  
When everybody loves me, I will never be lonely  
  
I want to be a lion  
Everybody wants to pass as cats  
We all want to be big big stars, but we got different reasons for that Believe  
in me because I don't believe in anything  
and I want to be someone to believe  
  
Mr. Jones and me stumbling through the barrio  
Yeah we star at the beautiful women  
"She's perfect for you, Man, there's got to be somebody for me."  
I want to be Bob Dylan  
Mr. Jones wishes he was someone just a little more funky  
When everybody loves you, son, that's just about as funky as you can be  
  
Mr. Jones and me staring at the video  
When I look at the television, I want to see me staring right back at me  
We all want to be big stars, but we don't know why and we don't know how  
But when everybody loves me, I'm going to be just about as happy as can be  
Mr. Jones and me, we're gonna be big stars

Well I woke up in mid-afternoon cause that's when it all hurts the most  
I dream I never know anyone at the party and I'm always the host  
If dreams are like movies, then memories are films about ghosts  
You can never escape, you can only move south down the coast  
  
Well, I am an idiot walking a tightrope of fortune and fame  
I am an acrobat swinging trapezes through circles of flame  
If you've never stared off in the distance, then your life is a shame  
And though I'll never forget your face,  
sometimes I can't remember my name  
  
Hey Mrs. Potter don't cry  
Hey Mrs. Potter I know why but  
Hey Mrs. Potter won't you talk to me  
  
Well, there's a piece of Maria in every song that I sing  
And the price of a memory is the memory of the sorrow it brings  
And there is always one last light to turn out and one last bell to ring  
And the last one out of the circus has to lock up everything  
  
Or the elephants will get out and forget to remember what you said  
And the ghosts of the tilt-a-whirl will linger inside of your head  
And the ferris wheel junkies will spin them forever instead  
When I see you a blanket of stars covers me in bed  
  
Hey Mrs. Potter don't go  
Hey Mrs. Potter I don't know but  
Hey Mrs. Potter won't you talk to me  
  
All the blue light reflections that color my mind when I sleep  
And the lovesick rejections that accompany the company I keep  
All the razor perceptions that cut just a little too deep  
Hey I can bleed as well as anyone, but I need someone to help me sleep  
  
So I throw my hand into the air and it swims in the beams  
It's just a brief interruption of the swirling dust sparkle jet stream  
Well, I know I don't know you and you're probably not what you seem  
But I'd sure like to find out  
So why don't you climb down off that movie screen  
  
Hey Mrs. Potter don't turn  
Hey Mrs. Potter I burn for you  
Hey Mrs. Potter won't you talk to me  
  
When the last king of Hollywood shatters his glass on the floor  
and orders another  
Well, I wonder what he did that for  
That's when I know that I have to get out cause I have been there before  
So I gave up my seat at the bar and I head for the door  
  
We drove out to the desert just to lie down beneath this bowl of stars  
We stand up at the Palace like it's the last of the great Pioneertown bars  
We shout out these songs against the clang of electric guitars  
You can see a million miles tonight  
But you can't get very far  
  
Hey Mrs. Potter I won't touch and  
Hey Mrs. Potter it's not much but  
Hey Mrs. Potter won't you talk to me  

My love  
Lives out at the end of the road  
Takes what you give her and goes  
Says things that everyone knows  
Shes only willing  
To kiss me again  
Lights me on fire  
Sprays me with water  
And she lights me up again  
Said my love  
Burried my head in the sand  
Screams just as loud as she can  
Sings me to sleep when I can't  
Shes always willing  
To kiss me again  
She wakes up the neighbors  
Goes down for water  
And then she comes up again  
I said good love  
Lives on the radio dial  
Never goes out of style  
Makes all the children run wild  
We keep on thinking  
Strait to the end?  
Now it's completly  
We just just shout for the moment and then we vanish again  
My love  
Waits at the end of the road  
Takes what you give her and goes  
Says things that everyone knows  
Ya she's my love  
Talking about my love  
Ya she's my love my love my love  
Shes my love

(Original by Ryan Adams )  
  
Well night time let her through  
Yeah I am talking to you  
I wanna see her  
Precious little thing  
With eyes that dance around without their clothes  
So buy a pretty dress  
Wear it out tonight  
For anyone you think could out do me  
Or better still, be my winding wheel  
Cause I feel just like a map  
Without a single place to go of interest  
And I am further north than south  
If I could shut my mouth she'd probably like this  
So buy a pretty dress  
And wear it out tonight  
For all the boys you think could out do me  
Or better still, be my winding wheel  
Be my winding wheel  
Well the children laugh and sing a song that ushers in her driving rain  
And I am standing in the station like some old record waiting on a train  
So buy a pretty dress  
Wear it out tonight  
For anyone you think could out do me  
Or better still be my winding wheel  
Be my winding wheel

(come on children, mind the gap)  
  
Miracle people with marvelous hair  
And a knack to do anything  
Better than anyone  
I got a home with electrical air  
And I live in a world  
Smaller than any one  
I got a line a new frontier  
I got a line on a new America  
All of the people are vanishing here  
I could be huge if I could just get from  
  
The outside of everything  
To the inside of you  
From the outside of everything  
To the inside of you  
  
Purest Aluminum people  
Are walking the streets of London  
So hysterical  
Nobody here gets a word that I say  
And the problems I'm told,  
Are more than medical  
I got a friend from the new frontier  
And Galen, she says,  
"this is not america"  
You need a girl with electrical hair  
And the word that you wanted was al-you-mi-ni-um  
  
From the outside of everything  
To the inside of you  
From the outside of everything  
To the inside  
  
I was in bed with  
The girl at the end of the world  
She says I'm goin' home  
And you should come home too  
I'm at the end of a new frontier  
Here at the edge of the flat earth ending  
I'm getting off to get lost in the air  
At the end of the world where the light is bending  
  
From the outside of everything to the inside of you  
From the outside of everything to the inside of you  
From the outside of everything to the inside of you  
From the outside of everything to the inside of you  
To the inside of you  
To the inside of you  
To the inside of you  
To the inside of you

Nothing but a Child Glass upon me walking on the ocean  
Sun upon me walking on a wave  
You can slide like the lord above.. You're a beam of teaming motion  
But for everyone you do,  
There's always one or two like me you can't save  
Sail on Maria, burn her to the ground  
Slide your hand between her tears until she comes  
Wake up her mother, tell her You're sorry now  
All gods children walk before they run  
Everything is beautiful in dreamland  
Everything is much, much better when we're gone  
Think I'm going to write myself a letter  
Something you can keep with you forever  
Because everybody gets to be perfect when they're gone  
Nothing but a child baby  
Nothing but a child baby  
Nothing but a child baby...  
In You're arms, I am

(Original by robyn hitchcock)  
  
Did you ever hover in the distance?  
Did you ever swoop down from the sky  
To the bright green rocks all draped with seaweed  
And the deep blue ocean rolling by?  
Maybe I will find today  
Maybe I will lose tomorrow  
Gonna rock on to the oceanside  
Did you ever see into the future?  
See the big red sun that won't go down?  
And the giant moths upon the cliffside  
In the deep red scar that was our town?  
Maybe I will find today  
Maybe I will lose tomorrow  
Gonna rock on to the oceanside  
Baby, we're the king and queen of nothing  
Everybody glows and then they're numb  
We can make a moment last forever  
Gaze across the ocean to the sun  
Maybe I will find today  
Maybe I will lose tomorrow  
Gonna rock on to the oceanside  
Gonna rock on to the oceanside  
Gonna rock on to the oceanside  
Baby, we're the king and queen of something  
Everybody goes and then they come

Start tearing the old man down  
Run past the heather and down to the old road  
Start turning the grain into the ground Roll a new leaf over  
In the middle of the night, there's an old man treading around in the gathered  
rain  
Well mister, if you're going to walk on water  
Could you drop a line my way?  
  
Omaha Somewhere in middle America  
Get right to the heart of matters  
It's the heart that matters more  
I think you better turn your ticket in  
And get your money back at the door  
  
Start threading a needle  
Brush past the shuttle that slides through the cold room  
Start turning the wool across the wire Roll a new life over  
In the middle of the night, there's an old man threading his toes through a  
bucket of rain  
Hey mister, you don't want to walk on water  
Because you're going to just walk all over me  
  
Omaha Somewhere in middle America  
Get right to the heart of the matters  
It's the heart that matters more  
I think you better turn your ticket in  
And get your money back at the door  
  
Start running the banner down  
Drop past the color come up through the summer rain  
Start turning the girl into the ground Roll a new love over  
In the middle of the day, there's a young man rolling around in the earth and  
rain  
Hey Mister, if you're going to walk on water  
You know you're only going to walk all over me.  
  
Omaha Somewhere in middle America  
Get right to the heart of matters  
It's the heart that matters more  
I think you better turn your ticket in  
And get your money back at the door

A picture of Amsterdam  
Bare trees under glass  
Framed in the afternoon light  
Of a winter long past  
When I was a raiser  
To Dublin I'd roam  
She was a bareback rider  
Some miles from home  
Come back to me  
She's a carnival driver  
Hung in the sky  
Cutting through time like a memory  
Strung on a wire  
The color of anything  
Fades in the air  
But she is the film of a book of the story  
Of the smell of her hair  
Come back to me  
When every thing's over  
And every thing's clear  
When everyone's older  
And no one is here  
I try to remember  
A girl on a wire  
Tumbling and diving above Stephen's Green  
Like a kite on the air  
Come back to me

Take a message to your head  
Just stay beside her in the bed  
You were so stupid  
To believe in things you couldn't see  
Then make them all you want  
  
If you haven't got the reasons  
Just make up any reasons  
Then pick them 'til they're torn  
  
Take it all away  
You took your coat today  
But they all go back in the morning  
  
Make a time to find your way  
I got a little further today  
Wash your eyes clear of anything  
Make them empty circles  
Dress yourself in black or Grey  
I'm hungry like a wild waif or only child  
This lithium is heroin to me  
  
It makes it all withdraw  
All the anger and loss  
But it all keeps coming back in the morning  
  
You keep yourself too clean  
You dig yourself a dream  
That we won't be coming home alone  
  
Not this time  
Not this time  
Not this time  
Not this time

Exit 8  
Small cafe  
Georgia moonlight  
It's three A. M.  
I've been driving all night  
Got a funny air  
Red-brown hair  
In the porch light  
She said 'We're open all night  
So won't you come inside  
It's gonna be all right'  
She said tired  
I said I'm a little bit unstable  
She said 'Honey, I will help you if I'm able  
There's a bottle of relief upon the table  
And we're open all night  
So won't you come inside  
It's gonna be all right'  
She said 'i was born the year the rockets landed  
Circa 1969 and I got stranded  
Yeah, but the comet's getting close  
And I can't stand it. '  
She said 'We're open all night  
So won't you come inside  
Exit A  
Small cafe  
Smoke at three  
Georgia moonlight  
It's eight A. M.  
I've been drinking all night  
And there is nothing I will not do to make it all right  
She said 'We're open all night  
So won't you come inside  
It's gonna be all right'

(Original by The Turtles - written by Warron Zevon )  
  
You can try to please me  
But it won't be easy  
Stone walls surround me  
I'm surprised that you even found me  
Chorus:  
And you don't stand an outside chance  
(you don't stand an outside chance)  
You don't stand an outside chance  
But you can try  
Whatever you do girl  
You know you can't get through girl  
Can't bring me down  
Hang me up or even hang around  
[repeat chorus]  
I know you think you'll get me  
I'm only flesh and bone  
But you may as well forget me  
'Cause my heart is stone  
You better leave me alone  
Stand an outside chance

[Verse:]  
There was a call at 3 A. M. At jfk  
Guess you stayed cuz you wanted to stay  
And we went from zero everything all in a day  
And then Kennedy took you away  
I thought of a short robe that was keeping you warm  
And the moments that make up your life till you wake up  
You sit on a swing in the dark with a girl  
She tells you she wanted to kiss you  
  
[Chorus:]  
And you know  
The worst part of a good day  
Is hearing yourself say goodbye  
To one more possibility day, goes on, and on  
  
[Verse 2:]  
I go west but your weather has changed  
But you're scared, and mistaken for strange  
You want me to leave then you start to believe  
I should stay, I gotta get out of la  
It seems that the short days are over  
Cause you don't just don't sleep in the daylight  
So I don't sit up nights  
I lay on my back on top of the hill  
And your body is breaking the sky cuz you're shakin'  
  
[Chorus:]  
And you know  
The worst part of a good day  
Is hearing yourself say goodbye  
To one more possibility day, yeah, it's gone  
  
[Verse 3:]  
We were waiting for winter this year but you came and it never appeared  
Me and you, we know too many reasons for people  
And season that pass like they weren't even here  
Now living in smiles is better you say  
We carry the burdens of all of our days  
So scared that you'll leave, you're scarred that I'll stay  
It's an impossibility day, we only saw half of the ballet  
I said good night, goodbye, seems like a good thing  
So you know it's a good lie  
You can run outta choices and still hear  
A voice in your head when you're lying in bed  
And it says that the best part of a bad day is knowing it's okey  
The color of everything changes the sky rearranges it's shade  
And the smile doesn't fade into the phone call and one bad decision we've made  
  
[Chorus:]  
And the worst part of a good day  
Is the one thing you don't say  
And you don't know how but you  
Wish there was some way so  
  
[Verse 4:]  
And you pull down the shades and you shut out the light  
Because somehow you mixed up, goodbye and good night  
And you one thing you won't say is everyone  
Knows possibility days are impossible  
It just feels wrong, so wrong, still you're gone, long gone

When I think of heaven (Deliver me in a black-winged bird)  
I think of flying down into a sea of pens and feathers  
and all other instruments of faith and sex and God  
In the belly of a black-winged bird  
Don't try to feed me  
I've been here before and I deserve a little more  
  
I belong in the service of the Queen I belong anywhere but in between  
She's been crying I've been thinking And I am the Rain King  
  
Mama, why am I so alone?  
I can't go outside  
I'm scared I might not make it home  
I'm alive but I'm sinking in  
If there's anyone at home at your place  
Why don't you invite me in  
Don't try to bleed me  
I've been there before and I deserve a little more  
  
I belong in the service of the Queen  
I belong anywhere but in between  
She's been lying  
I've been sinking  
And I am the Rain King  
  
Hey, I only want the same as anyone  
Henderson is waiting for the sun  
Oh, it seems night endlessly begins and ends  
After all the dreaming I come home again...  
  
When I think of heaven (Deliver me in a black-winged bird)  
I think of dying Lay me down in a field of flame and heather  
Render up my body into the burning heart of God in the belly of a black-winged  
bird  
Don't try to bleed me  
I've been here before and I deserve a little more  
  
I belong in the service of the Queen  
I belong anywhere but in between  
She's been dying  
I been drinking and I am the Rain King.  

This circus is falling down on its knees  
The big top is crumbling down  
It's raining in Baltimore fifty miles east  
Where you should be, no one's around  
  
I need a phone call  
I need a raincoat  
I need a big love  
I need a phone call  
  
These train conversations are passing me by  
And I don't have nothing to say  
You get what you pay for  
But I just had no intention of living this way  
  
I need a phone call  
I need a plane ride  
I need a sunburn  
I need a raincoat  
  
And I get no answers  
And I don't get no change  
It's raining in Baltimore, baby  
But everything else is the same  
  
There's things I remember and things I forget  
I miss you  
I guess that I should  
Three thousand five hundred miles away  
But what would you change if you could?  
  
I need a phone call  
Maybe I should buy a new car  
I can always hear a freight train  
If I listen real hard  
And I wish it was a small world  
Because I'm lonely for the big towns  
I'd like to hear a little guitar  
I think it's time to put the top down  
  
I need a phone call  
I need a raincoat

Gonna get back to basics  
Guess I'll start it up again  
I'm fallin' from the ceiling  
You're falling from the sky now and then  
  
Maybe you were shot down in pieces  
Maybe I slipped in between  
But we were gonna be the wildest people they ever hoped to see  
Just you and me  
  
So why'd you come home to this sleepless town  
It's a lifetime commitment  
Recovering the satellites  
All anybody really wants to know is...  
When you gonna come down  
  
Your mother recognizes all you're desperate displays  
And she watches as her babies drift violently away  
'Til they see themselves in telescopes  
Do you see yourself in me?  
We're such crazy babies, little monkey  
We're so fucked up, you and me  
  
So why'd you come home to this faithless town  
Where we make a lifetime commitment  
To recovering the satellites  
And all anybody really wants to know is...  
When are you gonna come down  
  
She sees shooting stars and comet tails  
She's got heaven in her eyes  
She says I don't need to be an angel  
But I'm nothing if I'm not this high  
  
But we only stay in orbit  
For a moment of time  
And then you're everybody's satellite  
I wish that you were mine  
  
So why'd you come home to this angel town  
It's a lifetime decision  
Recovering the satellites  
Everybody really knows for sure...  
That you're gonna come down  
That you're gonna come down  

Won't you scratch my itch sweet Annie Rich  
And welcome me back to town  
Come out on your porch or I'll step into your parlor  
And I'll show you how it all went down  
Out with the truckers and the kickers and the cowboy angels  
And a good saloon in every single town  
  
Oh, and I remember something you once told me  
And I'll be damned if it did not come true  
Twenty thousand roads I went down, down, down  
And they all lead me straight back home to you  
So I headed west to grow up with the country  
Out across those prairies with the waves of grain  
And I saw my devil,  
And I saw my deep blue sea  
And I thought about a calico bonnet from  
Cheyenne to Tennessee  
  
We flew straight across that river bridge,  
Last night at half past two  
The switch man waved his lantern goodbye  
And so long as we went rolling through  
Billboards and truck stops pass by the grievous angel  
And now I know just what I have to do  
  
And the man on the radio won't leave me alone  
He wants to take my money for something  
That I've never been shown  
And I saw my devil,  
And I saw my deep blue sea  
And I thought about a calico bonnet from  
Cheyenne to Tennessee  
  
The news I could bring I met up with the king  
On his head an amphetamine crown  
He talked about unbuckling that old Bible belt  
And lit out for some desert town  
Out with the truckers and the kickers and the cowboy angels  
And a good saloon in every single town  
  
Oh, but I remembered something you once told me  
And I'll be damned if it did not come true  
Twenty thousand roads I went down, down, down  
And they all lead me straight back home to you  
Twenty thousand roads I went down, down, down  
And they all lead me straight back home to you

[Verse:]  
Mary steers clear of the men from space  
Back alley kid with an American face  
She wants the wine, he brings a case  
To carry them on through  
I said you know what I know about the bedroom boys  
And the undercover russians in a pink Rolls Royce  
They bang the drum, she sets the beat  
They carry Miss America outta the street  
She sings snowman, scarecrow, John Doe, buffalo  
  
[Chorus:]  
I wish you wouldn't go, I got the arms to reach you  
I am a scarecrow dup dup, doo roo roop, dup dup, doo roo roop do  
Oh, I guess you ought to know, I got the hands to teach you  
I am the scarecrow dup dup, doo roo roop  
Snowman, sideshow, dup dup, doo roo roop  
  
[Verse 2:]  
I fell out of love in the snowbound days  
Riding the subway in a Valium haze  
I need the whites, she gets the blues it carries us on through  
All these American boys at the park and shop  
Selling their memories for a dollar a pop  
Ivan the ancient spaceman race fan  
Corners the market on American taste  
And says spaceman, scarecrow, peepshow, freak show  
  
[Chorus:]  
I wish you wouldn't go, I got the arms to reach you  
I am the scarecrow  
Dup dup, doo roo roop, dup dup, doo roo roop  
Oh I guess you ought to know, I got the hands to teach you  
I am the scarecrow dup dup, doo roo roop  
Punk rock video dup dup, doo roo roop  
  
[Verse 3:]  
All the sudden light inside you dies, maybe you're going on alone  
Maybe you go it all alone, she dreams of sunlight  
Sings of smaller things  
White sugar bowls and wedding rings and you go on from me alone  
You're going on, you're on your own  
She was married alive in a Moscow surgery  
Hoping to die in a Cold War nursery  
All of the kids back home believin' much more than we do  
It's a memory play where the memory fades  
And the pictures you took into records we played  
Spy versus spy, scarecrow and I  
Out across the darkness where the bomberjets fly, singing  
Spaceman, smoke show, scarecrow, geronimo  
  
[Chorus:]  
I wish you wouldn't go, I got the arms to reach you  
I am the scarecrow, dup dup, doo roo roop  
Dup dup, doo roo roop  
Oh I guess you ought to know, I got the hands to teach you  
I am the scarecrow dup dup, doo roo roop  
Snowman, freak show, dup dup, doo roo roop  
Come on, come on, come on!  
Oh, I wish you wouldn't go, I got the arms to reach you  
I am the scarecrow, dup dup, doo roo roop  
Dup dup, doo roo roop  
Oh, scarecrow, dup dup, doo roo roop  
Oh, I guess you ought to know, I got the hands to teach you  
I am the scarecrow dup dup, doo roo roop  
Listen on the midnight radio dup dup, doo roo roop

Shake Some Action  
I will find a way  
To get to you some day.  
Oh, but I, babe,  
I'm so afraid I'll fall,  
Yeah. Now can't you hear me call?  
Shake some action's what I need  
To let me bust out at full speed.  
I'm sure that's all you need  
To make it all right.  
It's taken me so long  
To get where I belong  
Oh, but, oh, please don't send me back that way, yeah.  
For I will make you pay. (refrain)  
If you don't dig what I say  
Then I will go away.  
And I won't come back this again.  
No. 'Cause I don't need a friend.  
(refrain)  
(guitar solo again)

Mary Jane says, it's all right  
She's just around the corner from the main light  
Any day now, it's all right  
She's standing on the precipice of big time  
  
And I know I'm a little uptight  
I got to go before the sun shines  
We're just a couple small people squeezing out a life  
We need a little good time  
  
It's not far from here  
Mary comes and goes  
Drifting through the scenery  
Of shallow days below  
Now that's everybody knows  
  
You follow trains out of town  
And they vanish somewhere under the horizon  
Yeah well, I saw Mary Jane drag her shadow  
Down the tracks, stare off in the distance  
  
It's not far from here  
Mary waves 'Hello'  
Smiling though she's sinking  
In the shallow days below  
  
Oh no, I can't find a way out of here  
Out on the road again  
I'm much, much too concerned about Mary Jane  
  
I'm all alone again and  
I like what she said but not what it means  
She leaves me drowning  
Through the shallow days down below  
  
You know I heard a band  
Playing waltzes in a grange hall  
The sun is sinking lower  
People staring, Mary Jane humming softly to herself  
And nobody really knows her  
  
Any day now it's all right  
She tells herself that this will be the last time  
Then Mary Jane pulls her hair back and wonders  
What she'll do with all her free time  
  
Not too far from here  
Mary turns to go  
Smiling while the waltz begins  
Dancing down the road  
  
Hey, hey, hey, hey, Mr. Freedom  
What are we supposed to think?  
'Cause I'm a very tiny person and it worries me  
  
I'm all alone again and  
I like what she says but not what it means  
She leaves me drowning  
In the shallow days way down below  
  
"I'm sorry", she said  
"I know it's not the kind of thing you want"  
I'm falling, falling down  
"I'm sorry", she said  
"I know I'm not the kind of girl you want"  
We're falling, falling, falling, falling down

(Original by Robyn Hitchcock)  
  
I used to ring you and put down the phone,  
Once wore a hole in your dress.  
Even tried Voodoo outside your home,  
But these days I couldn't care less.  
  
She doesn't exist any more,  
She doesn't exist any more.  
I let her go like the fool that I was,  
Thought I'd get over her soon.  
I smell her perfume when my eyes are closed,  
And I see her face in the moon.  
She doesn't exist any more,  
She doesn't exist any more.  
I tell myself it would be different now,  
I wouldn't treat her that way.  
I wouldn't be me if she wasn't her,  
And it's far too late, anyway.  
'Cause she doesn't exist any more,  
She doesn't exist any more.  
Only inside you the ghost of the love,  
That is wordless and painful and old.  
There's no one else in the whole outside world,  
That matches to her in your soul.  
But she doesn't exist any more,  
She doesn't exist any more.

(Original by The Cure)  
  
This is stranger than I thought  
Six different ways inside my heart  
And every one I'll keep tonight  
Six different ways go deep inside  
  
I'll tell them anything at all  
I know I'll give them more and more  
  
I'll tell them anything at all  
I know I'll give the world and more  
They think I'm on my hands and head  
This time they're much too slow  
  
Six sides to every lie I say  
It's that American voice again  
"It was never quite like this before  
Not one of you is the same... "  
This is stranger than I thought  
Six different ways inside my heart  
And everyone I'll keep tonight  
Six different ways go deep inside

Something going on around here  
I could not crawl back if I tried  
Couldn't wait around  
Couldn't wait another second  
There's something going on around here  
I left my baby on the side of hte highway  
She just couldn't see things my way  
Someday  
I will treat you good  
Someday  
I will treat you fine  
Someday  
I will treat you good  
I know I should  
Everything that's amazed me  
Has decayed  
Like shrinking bones in the sun  
Can't you tell me why it is  
That the beautiful ones are crazy  
She's whispering like a mortician now  
I left my baby by the side of the road  
I left her with a heavy load  
Someday  
I will treat you good  
Someday  
I will treat you fine  
Someday  
I will treat you good  
I know I should  
Something going on around here  
I couldn't crawl back if I tried  
I left my baby by the side of the road  
I left her with a heavy load  
Oh  
Someday  
I will treat you good  
Someday  
I will treat you fine  
Someday  
I will you treat you good  
I know I should

I get so nervous I'm shaking  
Gets so I got no pride at all  
Gets so bad but I just keep coming back for more  
I guess I just get off on that stuff  
  
I'm thinking about taking some time  
I'm thinking about leaving soon  
  
I got some things I can't tell anyone  
I got some things I just can't say  
They're the kind of things no one knows about  
I just need somebody to talk to me  
  
I'm thinking about leaving tomorrow  
I'm thinking about being on my own  
I think I been wasting my time  
I'm thinking about getting out  
  
In all this time,  
The bottom line's you don't know how much I feel  
You say you see but I don't agree  
You don't know how I feel  
  
I'm just trying to get myself some gravity  
You're just trying to get me to stay  
Sometimes I sit here looking down upon Los Angeles  
Sometimes I'm floating away  
  
I'm thinking about breakin myself  
I'm thinking about getting back home  
I think I been waiting for way too long  
I'm thinking about getting out  

Staring out of his window as the world rushes by  
Arthur Robinson closes the glass and replies,  
"I dream of Ballerinas and I don't know why  
but I see Cadillac's sailing  
  
I was born on the shores of the Chesapeake Bay  
But Maryland and Virginia have faded away  
And I keep thinking tomorrow is coming today  
So I am endlessly waiting  
  
And the comet is coming between  
Me and the girl who could make it all clean  
Out there in the shadow of the modern machine  
Walks St. Robinson in his Cadillac dream.  
  
Carrie's down in her basement all toe shoes and twinned  
With the girl in the mirror who spins when she spins  
From where you think you'll end up to the state that you're in  
Your reflection approaches and then recedes again  
  
And the comet is coming between  
Me and the girl who could make it all clean  
Out there in the shadow of the modern machine  
Walks St. Robinson in his Cadillac dream.  
  
I have dreamed of a black car that shimmers and drives  
Down the length of the evening to the carnival side  
In a house where regret is a carousel ride  
We are spinning and spinning and spinning and now...  
  
There's a hole in the ceiling down through which I fell  
There's a girl in a basement coming out of her shell  
And there are people who will say that they knew me so well'  
I may not go to heaven  
I hope you go to hell  
  
And the comet is coming between  
Me and the girl who could make it all clean  
Out there in the shadow of the modern machine  
Walks St. Robinson in his Cadillac dream.

Take the way home that leads back to Sullivan St.  
Cross the water and home through the town  
Past the shadows that fall down wherever we meet  
Pretty soon I won't come around  
  
I'm almost drowning in her sea  
She's nearly fallen to her knees  
  
Take the way home that leads back to Sullivan St.  
Where all the bodies hang on the air  
If she remembers, she hides it whenever we meet  
Either way now, I don't really care  
  
I'm almost drowning in her seas  
She's nearly crawling on her knees  
She's down on her knees  
  
Take the way home that leads back to Sullivan St.  
I'm just another rider burned to the ground  
  
I'm almost drowning in her sea  
She's nearly crawling on her knees  
It's almost everything I need  
I'm down on my knees  
I'm down on my knees  

Colored rubbers and a bedroom set  
I wouldn't know it if it hit me  
You take a little step and then it feels like love  
I think I better get a little of it in me  
Give me a kiss  
I think it feels like love  
Give me a kiss  
I think it feels like sunshine  
C'mon baby, light me up  
I wanna look into your eyes until I go blind and...  
  
[Chorus]  
You think that you can do without me  
I can't do anything at all  
You think that you can do without me  
But I don't believe in Sundays  
And I don't believe in anything at all  
  
Your mother make you in a parking lot  
My mother made me out of flesh and wire  
Try to remember what you might forget  
I try to remember everything  
Try to remember so you don't disappear  
Try to remember so you don't fade away  
Your mother made you out of smoke and rain  
Your mother made you in a fire that's faded  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I wanna touch you for the things I'm losing  
I wanna touch you for my self-respect  
Give me a reason or I might stop breathing  
Give me a reason why I'm soaking wet  
Gotta stop breathing cause the sky is falling  
I might go out and watch the moon explode  
Give me directions to the highway crossing  
I'll go lie down in the middle of the road  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I don't believe in Sundays  
And I don't believe in anything at all  
I don't believe in anything at all

(original by Oasis )  
  
I need to be myself  
I can't be no one else  
I'm feeling supersonic  
Give me gin and tonic  
You can have it all but how much do you want it?  
You make me laugh  
Give me your autograph  
Can I ride with you in your BMW ?  
You can sail with me in my yellow submarine  
You need to find out  
'Cos no one's gonna tell you what I'm on about  
You need to find a way for what you want to say  
But before tomorrow  
'Cos my friend said he'd take you home  
He sits in a corner all alone  
He lives under a waterfall  
Nobody can see him  
Nobody can ever hear him call  
You need to be yourself  
You can't be no one else  
I know a girl called Elsa  
She's into Alka Seltzer  
She sniffs it through a cane on a supersonic train  
She made me laugh  
I got her autograph  
She done it with a doctor on a helicopter  
She's sniffin in her tissue  
Sellin' the Big Issue  
She needs to find out  
'Cos no one's gonna tell you what I'm on about  
She needs to find a way for what she wants to say  
But before tomorrow  
'Cos my friend said he'd take you home  
He sits in a corner all alone  
He lives under a waterfall  
No body can see him  
No body can ever hear him call

(Original by Lynyrd Skynard)  
  
Big wheels keep on turning carry me home to see my kin  
Singing songs about the southland  
I miss my family once again and I think it's a sin  
Well I heard Mr. Young sing about her  
Well I heard Ol' Neil put her down  
Well I hope Neil Young will remember  
A Southern man don't need him around anyhow  
Chorus:  
Sweet home Alabama where the skies are so blue  
Sweet home Alabama Lord I'm coming home to you  
In Birmingham they love the governor boo-hoo-hoo  
Now we all did what we could do  
Now Watergate pisses me off so much  
Does your conscience bother you tell me true  
Chorus:  
Here I come Alabama  
Solo  
Now Muscle Shoals has got the swampers, they've been known to pick a song or
two  
Lord they get me off so much  
They pick me up when I'm feelin' blue  
Now how about you  
Chorus:  
Sweet home Alabama where the skies are so blue oh sweet home  
Sweet home Alabama Lord I'm coming home to you And the gov'nor's true  
Sweet home Alabama where the skies are so blue oh yeah  
Sweet home Alabama Lord I'm coming home to you yeah yeah

She's closing all the shades  
She finds the daylight just a little frightening  
She pulls the pedals overhead each day  
But she's opening her business is blooming nightly  
And every time it does it gets me hazy  
The color of her head changing every day  
A little breath of wind and I just go crazy  
The greening of Americas progressing smoothly  
Cuz she's choosing me  
It's later then I said  
And all the worlds a shade of black and purple  
Everybody else has gone to bed  
But when she makes me happy I just fly in circles  
And every time she does I just get teary  
The color of head changing everyday  
A little puff of wind and she's always near me  
The greening of America is progressing nicely  
It's all right with me  
Ba ba ba ba na na na na na [Etc.]  
If there's another life, and if get to chose I'd like  
To be a daisy  
I'll stay up waiting for my dusky wife  
To open and get high with just my jasmine baby  
And every time she does it gets me crazy  
The color of her head changing every day  
A little breath of wind and I just get crazy  
The greening of Americas progressing nicely  
It's all right with me-every time she  
She does just get teary  
The color of her head changing every day  
A little breath of wind and she's always near me  
The greening of Americas progressing smoothly  
Cuz she's choosing me

If I had a dollar  
For every time  
You broke my heart,  
Messed up my mind  
  
Well I'd be the richest man  
I'd be the richest man  
... In the world  
  
If bad times paid interest  
I'd have you to thank  
I'd be driving a new car,  
Have money in the bank  
  
I'd be the richest man  
I'd be the richest man  
... In the world  
  
Baby.. Money can't buy love  
The kind I dream of is so hard to find  
For a good womans touch in the morning when I rise  
Well baby I'd give up every single dime  
  
Money can't buy love  
The kind I dream of is so hard to find  
For a good woman's touch in the mrning when I rise  
Baby I'd give up every single dime  
  
If teardrops were diamonds from the African mines  
If heartaches were silver  
My whole life would shine  
And I'd be the richest man  
I'd be the richest man  
... In the world  
  
Baby.

(Original by Talking Heads)  
  
Home is where I want to be  
Pick me up and turn me around  
I feel numb - burn with a weak heart  
(So I) guess I must be having fun  
The less we say about it the better  
Make it up as we go along  
Feet on the ground  
Head in the sky  
It's okay I know nothing's wrong. . Nothing  
  
Hi yo I got plenty of time  
Hi yo you got light in your eyes  
And you're standing here beside me  
I love the passing of time  
Never for money  
Always for love  
Cover up and say goodnight. .. Say goodnight  
Home - is where I want to be  
But I guess I'm already there  
I come home - -she lifted up her wings  
Guess that this must be the place  
I can't tell one from another  
Did I find you, or you find me?  
There was a time before we were born  
If someone asks, this is where I'll be. .. Where I'll be  
Hi yo We drift in and out  
Hi yo sing into my mouth  
Out of all those kinds of people  
You got a face with a view  
I'm just an animal looking for a home  
Share the same space for a minute or two  
And you love me till my heart stops  
Love me till I'm dead  
Eyes that light up, eyes look through you  
Cover up the blank spots  
Hit me on the head Ah ooh

I wanted so badly  
Somebody other than me  
Staring back at me  
But you were gone  
  
I wanted to see you walking backwards  
And get the sensation of you coming home  
I wanted to see you walking away from me  
Without the sensation of you leaving me alone  
  
Time and time again  
Time and time again  
Time and time again  
I can't please myself  
  
I wanted the ocean to cover over me  
I wanna sink slowly without getting wet  
Maybe someday, I won't be so lonely  
And I'll walk on water every chance I get  
  
Time and time again  
Time and time again  
Time and time again  
I can't please myself  
  
So when are you coming home  
Sweet angel?  
You leaving me alone?  
All alone?  
Well, if I'm drowning darling, you'll come down this way on your own  
  
I wish I was traveling on a freeway  
Beneath this graveyard western sky  
I'm gonna set fire to this city  
And out into the desert  
we're gonna ride  
  
Time and time again  
Time and time again  
Time and time again  
I can't please myself

Look me in the eye  
Then, tell me that I'm satisfied  
Was you satisfied?  
Look me in the eye  
Then, tell me that I'm satisfied  
Hey, are you satisfied?  
And it goes so slowly on  
Everything I've ever wanted  
Tell me what's wrong  
Look me in the eye  
And tell me that I'm satisfied  
Were you satisfied?  
Look me in the eye  
Then, tell me I'm satisfied  
And now are you satisfied?  
Everything goes  
Well, anything goes all of the time  
Everything you dream of  
Is right in front of you  
And every dream is a lie  
Look me in the eye  
And tell me that I'm satisfed  
Look me in the eye  
Unsatisfied  
I'm so, I'm so unsatisfied  
I'm so dissatisfied  
I'm so, I'm so unsatisfied  
I'm so unsatisfied  
Well, I'm-a  
I'm so, I'm so unsatisfied  
I'm so dissatis, dissattis...  
I'm so

Is everybody happy now?  
Is everybody clear?  
We could drive out to the dunes tonight,  
'cause summer's almost here.  
And I've been up all night,  
I might sleep all day.  
Get your dreams just right  
Let them slip away,  
I might sleep all day.  
When the roads are clear,  
We'll head on out of here,  
If you're coming back,  
I'll see you in the morning  
I'm just staring at  
The ceiling staring back at me,  
Just waiting for the daylight to come crawling in on me...  
And I've been up all night,  
I might sleep all day.  
Get your dreams just right  
And let them slip away,  
I might sleep all day.  
Ohhh... It's too late to get high now.  
2X  
Fix your hair just right  
Put your jeans on tight,  
Wear a dress, so I can get it off real easy.  
'Cause I've been thinking I'd  
Like to see your eyes  
Open up real wide the minute that you see me.  
If you don't come through,  
I wouldn't wait for you.  
I understand that everyone goes disappearing,  
Into the greatest grey  
That covers over everyday,  
And hovers in the distance and the distance and the distance...  
I've been up all night,  
I might sleep all day.  
Get your dreams just right  
Let them slip away,  
I might sleep all day.  
Ohh... It's too late to get high now.  
2X  
Baby I'm not alone  
Only wanna get high

(Original by Cracker)  
  
I'm so fucking sick  
I'm the king of the world  
I'm a genius of useless stuff  
Some people they gotta work  
Well I just hang around  
Dreaming up useless stuff  
So if I call you from time to time  
I said my life is such a drag  
I feel like a hag please shut me up  
Girl would you like to live my life  
And I'll be with you tonight  
I'll be your useless stuff  
Now everybody wants to be our friend  
So we act real Zen  
And hang around with movie stars  
So if I call you from time to time  
I said my life is such a drag  
I feel like a hag kick me in the ass  
Girl would you like to live my life  
And I'll be with you tonight  
I'll be your useless stuff  
I'll be your useless stuff  
Can I be your useless stuff?

I sold my piano  
It couldn't come with me  
I locked up my bedroom  
And I walked out into the air  
When nothing I needed  
Is left there behind me  
I walk out through the shadows  
Of Washington Square  
  
Now I wander the highway from Dublin to Berkeley  
And I heard the songbirds of Valley Paurine  
I love like a fountain  
And it left me like nothing  
Just the memories of walking through Washington Square  
  
Now I live in the shadows  
Where light is electric  
And time is just a number  
That rests on a wall  
Nobody knows me  
My friends and my family  
Are as far from this city  
As Washington Square  
  
So cover this warm night  
In a blanket of starlight  
I will follow this freeway  
Out into the air  
In case you should wonder  
And wanted to find me  
I'm traveling homeward to Washington Square  
In case you should wonder  
I'm in Washington Square  
Washington Square  
Washington Square

Who built the ball that is this earth?  
Gave me life, and water for my thirst.  
Home for a heart till death from birth  
And we're only love, at it's best or worst.  
Love calling your name  
I will live on  
Calling your name  
Who wrote the pages of our lives?  
In black and white, and taught me wrong from right  
It's your heart that held you tight  
But we're only love  
Spin me around and round and round  
Love calling your name  
I will live on  
Calling your name  
And the world seems like my enemy  
The waterfall of frowns  
And the wave of life will capture me  
And I'm falling down upon love  
C'mon now darling  
I'm falling falling down on love  
I'm falling down, falling down on love  
I'm falling down on love  
[Chorus:]

What I feel, I can't say  
But my love is there for you anytime of day  
But if it's not love that you need  
Then I'll try my best to make everything succeed  
  
Tell me, what is my life without your love  
Tell me, who am I without you, by my side  
  
What I know, I can do  
If I give my love now to everyone like you  
But if it's not love that you need  
Then I'll try my best to make ev'rything succeed  
  
Tell me, what is my life without your love  
Tell me, who am I without you, by my side  
Tell me, what is my life without your love  
Tell me, who am I without you, by my side  
  
What I feel, I can't say  
But my love is there for you any time of day  
But if it's not love that you need  
Then I'll try my best to make everything succeed  
  
Tell me, what is my life without your love  
Tell me, who am I without you, by my side  
Oh tell me, what is my life without your love  
Tell me, who am I without you, by my side  
What is my life without your love  
Tell me, who am I without you, by my side  
(fade:)  
Oh tell me, what is my life without your love  
Tell me who am I without you by my side

Fun baby...  
  
Freeze... Rock!  
  
Bass..  
  
Oh white... White(repeat 3x) ooooo..  
  
(chorus 1)  
White lines (vision dreams of passion)  
blowin through my mind (and all the while I think of you)  
Pipe cries (a very strange reaction)  
for us to unwind (the more I see, the more I do)  
something like a phenomenom (baby)  
tellin your body to come along, but white lines, blow away....  
  
Blow... Rock it... Blow..  
  
Ticket to ride, white line highway  
tell all your friends that they can come my way  
pay your toll  
sell your soul  
pound for pound cost more than gold  
the longer you stay, the more you pay  
my white lines go a long way  
either up your nose or through your veins  
with nothing to gain except killin your brain  
  
Freeze... Rock (repeat 4x) ... Go  
  
Get higher baby  
get higher baby  
and don't ever come down... Freebase  
  
Arang-dig-dangity-dang-gitang  
arang-dig-dangity-dang-gitang  
arang-dig-dangity-dang-dang-gity-dang-itang  
  
Pipe cries (pure as the driven snow)  
connected to my mind (and now I'm havin fun baby)  
pipe rides (its getting kind of low)  
cuz it makes you feel so fine (i need some one-on-one baby)  
  
Don't let it blow yor mind away (baby)  
And go to a little hide away  
cuz whitle lines, blow away....  
  
Blow... Rock... Blow...  
  
A million magic crystals  
painted pure and white  
a multi-million dollars  
Almost over night  
twice as sweet as sugar, twice as bitter as salt  
and if you get hooked baby  
its nobodyelses fault, so don't do it!  
  
Blow... Rock (repeat 4x)  
  
Higher baby  
get higher baby  
get higher baby  
And don't ever come down... Freebase!  
  
Don't you get to high (don't you get to high baby)  
Turns you on (you really turn me on and on)  
told you to come down (my temperature is risin)  
when the thrill is gone (no, I don't want you to go)  
  
A street kid gets arrested  
gonna do some time  
he got out three years from just to commit more crime  
a business man is caught, with 24 kilos  
hes out on bail and out of jail  
And that's the way it goes... Rrrhuh!  
  
Sugar... Cane (repeat 2x)  
  
Ahletes reject it  
governors correct it  
ganstars, thugs and smugglers are throully respected  
the money gets divided  
The women get excited  
now I'm broke and its no joke  
Its hard as hell to fight it, don't buy it  
  
Freeze... Rock (repeat 4x)rrruh.. Go  
  
Get higher baby  
Get higher girl  
get higher baby.. C'mon! Rruh  
  
(repeat chorus 1)  
  
Little jack horner  
sittin in a corner  
with no shoes or clothes  
this aint funny  
but he took his money  
And sniffed it up his nose  
  
(repeat chorus 1)

It's 1:30 in the morning  
That's alright by me  
You just waiting by the phone  
I should give a little warning  
But I need the things I need  
I'm not proud to need a hand  
But I just don't understand  
So, Why should you come when I call  
  
I never say nothing at all  
Why do I go, when I go  
It's leaving me here all alone  
You ought to get out on your own  
Ain't necessarily a bad thing  
To believe the things I say  
Cause you can make yourself feel good  
You know it's really not a good thing  
  
To give everything to me  
I'm just waiting for the show  
Cause I got no where to go  
So, Why should you come when I call  
I never say nothing at all  
Why do I go, when I go  
It's leaving me here all alone  
You ought to get out on your own  
Cause nothing makes me feel so good  
  
Gets me high  
So I sleep at night  
And that's enough and everything  
  
Alright  
I feel nice  
So sorry in the morning  
Could believe what you believe  
  
I'm used to waking up alone  
And if you think about it  
Anyone you think about is a better love than me  
But if you've not fallin' quite asleep?  
  
I might call tonight  
If that's alright  
Why should you come when I call  
I never say nothing at all  
Why do I go, when I go  
It's leaving me here all alone  
You ought to get out on your own

I'm an outcast that no one can save anymore  
And the days of my youth, have all long gone by now  
I was the kind of boy the devil would offer a smoke or a drink to  
Or a ride downtown to some God forsaken land  
  
One Sunday morning at dawn you know they baptized my soul  
But they held me down so long Christ I almost drowned  
Yeah I was the kind of boy who never learned to smile  
So I kicked and I screamed  
'till I tore myself lose from all these great big hands Oh Yeah  
  
Chorus:  
Wiseblood knows how to walk the way the wind blows  
Wiseblood hears grace whisper right behind  
  
My mommma, she turned around and said  
"Little boy you better wake up....cause your a walking dead"  
Oh she was the kind a girl who never touched a smoke or a drink  
She just smoldered like an empty church left to burn in the wind

Did you think you were unbelievable  
Then, I see that  
Twenty-four hours in a wishing well  
Thinking about drowning  
Thinking about pennies in heaven  
I guess I'll realize in a day or more  
I guess I'll tilt my head back in the rain  
Drown myself on sky  
I guess I'll realize in a day or more  
I guess I'll realize when I'm buried in the evidence  
Did you think you were irresponsible  
Well I don't see that  
One or two children on a workingman's salary  
Doesn't seem like a lot to ask  
I guess I'll realize in a day or more  
I guess I'll realize when her baby starts to cry  
Mothers in welfare lines  
Husbands who said good-bye  
I think I realize  
I think I realize, yeah  
Didn't you wonder where your bright-eyed babyboy has gone  
He's sleeping in the bottom of a wishing well  
Whispering' the ripples through the fates and changes  
Did you think you were young and beautiful  
Then, I see that  
One or two people sliding gracefully together and apart  
This sort of thing never lasts  
I guess I'll realize in a day or more  
I guess I'll realize when I'm twisting in the wind  
After I say good-bye, I guess I'll understand why  
I guess I realize  
I guess I realize  
Didn't you wonder where your bright-eyed babyboy has gone  
He's a victim in the bottom of a wishing well  
Wishing he was anywhere but there and gone  
And, didn't anyone wonder where their bright-eyed babyboy has gone  
He's sleeping in the bottom of a wishing well  
Wishing he wasn't suffering the same dreams all day long  
I think I realize  
I think I realize  
Ahh baby, I think that I realize  
I think I realize..

Clouds so swift  
Rain won't lift  
Gate won't close  
Railings froze  
Get your mind off wintertime  
You ain't going nowhere  
Oo-ee! Ride me high  
Tomorrow's the day  
My bride's gonna come  
Oh no, are we gonna fly  
Down in the easy chair!  
  
I don't care  
How many letters they sent  
The morning came and the morning went  
Pick up your money  
And pack up your tent  
You ain't going nowhere  
Oo-ee! Ride me high  
Tomorrow's the day  
My bride's gonna come  
I said oh no, are we gonna fly  
Down in the easy chair!  
  
Buy me a flute  
And a gun that shoots  
Tailgates and substitutes  
Strap yourself  
To a tree with roots  
'Cause you know you ain't going nowhere  
I said oo-ee! Ride me high  
Tomorrow's the day  
My bride's gonna come  
I said oh no, are we gonna fly  
Down in the easy chair!  
  
Genghis Khan  
He could not keep  
All his kings  
Supplied with sleep  
We'll climb that hill no matter how steep  
Just as soon as we get the hell up to it  
And Everybody says  
Whoo-ee! Ride me high  
Tomorrow's the day  
My bride's gonna come  
Oh, no are we gonna fly  
Down in the easy chair!  
  
I said oo-ee! Ride me high  
Tomorrow's the day  
My bride's gonna come  
I said oh no, are we gonna fly  
Down in the easy chair!  
  
Well everybody said oo-ee! Ride me high  
Tomorrow's the day  
My bride's gonna come  
I said oh no, are we gonna fly  
Down in the easy chair!  
  
Oo-ee! Won't you ride me high  
Tomorrow's the day  
My bride's gonna come  
I said oh no, are we gonna fly  
Down into the easy chair!

Anythings hard to change  
But hey I got you down on your knees again  
You watch the sky  
It's a pale parade of passing clouds  
That cover  
The bed upon which we laid  
In the dark  
And the memories that I made  
Of a laughing girl  
But you're just my toy  
And I can't stop playing with you, baby  
  
[Chorus]  
If you think you need to go  
If you wanted to be free  
There's one thing you need to know  
And that's that you can't count on me  
  
Coming along real good  
But I still can't do most of the things I should  
I watch the sky coming down to bury me and  
I can't stop this crawling out of my skin  
I know that you see yourself flying in  
Out of the sky  
Coming down  
To carry me  
But I won't come out  
  
[Chorus]  
  
No you can't count on me  
  
I watched all of the same parades  
As they passed on the days that you wish you'd stayed  
All this pain gets me high  
And I get off and you know why  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Aw you can't count on me  
No you can't count on me
