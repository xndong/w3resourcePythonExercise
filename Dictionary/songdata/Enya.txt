You're everything my dreams have seen.  
But, what are dreams?  
I'm walking where my dreams have been.  
But, what are dreams?  
  
Can I believe these spells I feel?  
I'm wary now.  
Can I believe, or is this real?  
I'm wary now.  
  
Just like some new-born creature, I.  
What are dreams?  
A child in need of love and care.  
Tell me what, tell me what, are dreams?  
  
Can I believe these spells I feel?  
I'm wary now.  
Can I believe, or is this real?  
I'm wary now.  
  
Just like some new-born creature, I.  
What are dreams?  
A child in need of love and care.  
Tell me what, tell me what, are dreams?

Cold as the northern winds  
In December mornings,  
Cold is the cry that rings  
From this far distant shore.  
Winter has come too late  
Too close beside me.  
How can I chase away  
All these fears deep inside?  
  
I'll wait the signs to come.  
I'll find a way  
I will wait the time to come.  
I'll find a way home.  
My light shall be the moon  
And my path - the ocean.  
My guide the morning star  
As I sail home to you.  
  
I'll wait the signs to come.  
I'll find a way  
I will wait the time to come.  
I'll find a way home.  
My light shall be the moon  
And my path - the ocean.  
My guide the morning star  
As I sail home to you.  
  
Who then can warm my soul?  
Who can quell my passion?  
Out of these dreams - a boat  
I will sail home to you.  

Once, as my heart remembers,  
All the stars were fallen embers.  
Once, when night seemed forever  
I was with you.  
  
Once, in the care of morning  
In the air was all belonging.  
Once, when that day was dawning  
I was with you.  
  
How far we are from morning,  
How far we are  
And the stars shining through the darkness,  
Falling in the air.  
  
Once, as the night was leaving  
Into us our dreams were weaving.  
Once, all dreams were worth keeping.  
I was with you.  
  
Once, when our hearts were singing,  
I was with you.

Lovers in the long grass  
Look above them  
Only they can see  
Where the clouds are going  
Only to discover  
Dust and sunlight  
Ever make the sky so blue  
  
Afternoon is hazy  
River flowing  
All around the sounds  
Moving closer to them  
Telling them the story  
Told by Flora  
Dreams they never knew  
  
Silver willows  
Tears from Persia  
Those who come  
From a far-off island  
Winter Chanterelle lies  
Under cover  
Glory-of-the-sun in blue  
  
Some they know as passion  
Some as freedom  
Some they know as love  
And the way it leaves them  
Summer snowflake  
For a season  
When the sky above is blue  
When the sky above is blue  
  
Lying in the long grass  
Close beside her  
Giving her the name  
Of the one the moon loves  
This will be the day she  
Will remember  
When she knew his heart  
Was  
Loving in the long grass  
Close beside her  
Whispering of love  
And the way it leaves them  
Lying in the long grass  
In the sunlight  
They believe it's true love  
And from all around them  
Flora's secret  
Telling them of love  
And the way it breathes  
And  
Looking up from eyes of  
Amaranthine  
They can see the sky  
Is blue  
Knowing that their love  
Is true  
Dreams they never knew  
And the sky above is blue

Dawn breaks, there is blue in the sky.  
Your face before me  
Though I don't know why.  
Thoughts disappearing like tears from the Moon.  
  
Waiting here, as I sit by the stone,  
They came before me  
Those men from the Sun.  
Signs from the heavens say I am the one.  
  
Now you're here, I can see your light,  
This light that I must follow.  
You, you may take my life away, so far away.  
Now I know I must leave your spell  
I want tomorrow.  
  
Now you're here, I can see your light,  
This light that I must follow.  
You, you may take my life away, so far away.  
Now I know I must leave your spell  
I want tomorrow.

When the stars are in the skies,  
Make a wish then close your eyes.  
Are you dreaming,  
Angels singing,  
Everything is right.  
It's the magic of the night.  
  
Far horizons made of snow,  
Bring the hopes each child will know.  
Someone's dreaming,  
Bells are ringing,  
Everything is white.  
It's the magic of the night.  
  
High up in the sky, can you see a shining light?  
Can it be that we can see an angel who is flying, flying?  
  
Can an angel lose their way,  
Who of us on earth can say?  
Someone's dreaming,  
Angels singing,  
Everything is right.  
It's the magic of the night.  
  
High up in the sky, can you see a shining light?  
Can it be that we can see an angel who is flying, flying?  
  
When the stars are in the skies,  
Make a wish then close your eyes.  
Are you dreaming,  
Bells are ringing,  
Angels are in flight.  
It's the magic of the night.  
  
Angels are in flight,  
It's the magic of the night.

My! My! Time flies! One step and we're on the moon, next step into the stars  
My! My! Time flies! Maybe we could be there soon, a one way ticket to mars  
  
My! My! Time flies! A man underneath a tree, an apple falls on his head  
My my time flies a man wrote a symphony, it's 1812  
  
My! My! Time flies! Four guys across abbey road, one forgot to wear shoes  
My! My! Time flies! A rap on a rhapsody, a king who's still in the news, a
king to sing you the blues  
  
My! My! Time flies! A man in a winter sleigh, white white white as the snow  
My! My! Time flies! A new day is on its way, so let's let yesterday go  
Could be we step out again  
Could be tomorrow but then,  
Could be 2010

O come, o come Emmanuel,  
To free your captive Israel.  
That mourns in lonely exile here,  
Until the Son of God appear.  
  
[Chorus]  
Rejoice! Rejoice!  
O Israel, to you shall come Emmanuel.  
  
Veni, veni, Emanuel!  
Captivum solve Israel!  
Qui gemit in exilio,  
Privatus Dei Filio.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Gaude, gaude, Emanuel  
Nascetur pro te, Israel.  
  
(Gaude, gaude)  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Gaude, gaude, Emanuel  
Nascetur pro te, Israel.

Strange how my heart beats  
To find myself upon your shore.  
Strange how I still feel  
My loss of comfort gone before.  
Cool waves wash over  
And drift away with dreams of youth  
So time is stolen  
I cannot hold you long enough.  
And so this is where I should be now  
  
Days and nights falling by  
Days and nights falling by me.  
I know of a dream I should be holding  
Days and nights falling by  
Days and nights falling by me.  
  
Cool waves wash over  
And drift away with reams of youth  
So time is stolen  
I cannot hold you long enough.  
Soft blue horizons  
Reach far into my childhood days  
As you are rising  
To bring me my forgotten ways  
  
Strange how I falter  
To find I'm standing in deep water  
Strange how my heart beats  
To find I'm standing on your shore  

Pilgrim, how you journey  
On the road you chose  
To find out why the winds die  
And where the stories go.  
All days come from one day  
That much you must know,  
You cannot change what's over  
But only where you go  
  
One way leads to diamonds,  
One way leads to gold,  
Another leads you only  
To everything you're told.  
In your heart you wonder  
Which of these is true,  
The road that leads to nowhere,  
The road that leads to you.  
  
Will you find the answer  
In all you say and do?  
Will you find the answer  
In you?  
  
Each heart is a pilgrim,  
Each one wants to know  
The reason why the winds die  
And where the stories go.  
Pilgrim, in your journey  
You may travel far,  
For pilgrim it's a long way  
To find out who you are  
  
Pilgrim it's a long way  
To find out who you are  
  
Pilgrim it's a long way  
To find out who you are

Deep in my dreams,  
I saw you close by my side.  
And the words you said to me,  
Made me reel down deep inside.  
My hand in your hand,  
So warm and so lovingly.  
Leaving all my dreams behind,  
Wonder who my prince will be?  
  
[Chorus:]  
What is this wonder,  
That love can make you feel?  
Am I deep now in slumber,  
Or is my prince real?  
Now, now my dream,  
Is standing close by my side.  
Saying words I wish to hear,  
And I'm reeling deep inside.  
  
[Chorus]  
Morning has come,  
My dreams are left far behind.  
As I walk through Paris streets,  
I know now what I shall find.  
This smile on my face,  
Will carry a love I have known.  
Like a fairytale come true,  
Oh, what joy this love has shown

From the City of Constellations  
To the wanderer  
And a Place of Rains  
He journeys on  
The City of hesitation and doubt  
The Island if the house the color of the sea  
The Plain of Mementoes  
He journeys on to find his love  
Th Valley of lost time  
The City of End and Endlessness  
The Isle of Revenents  
He journeys on  
The City of Solitudes  
The City of distance from you  
The City of Words of blue  
And yellow and red and green  
He journeys on to find his love  
  
Where the road takes him through  
The City of Sleep  
The thinking that does not end in within him  
Then he dreams  
The road takes him  
This man who is searching  
It brings him  
In silence through the night  
Where the Cities that do not Exist, exist  
It brings him  
In silence through the night  
Close to the City of Realizations  
It is here one finds the way  
Mount Orison  
The City of Days  
The Tree of the lost  
He journeys on  
North of his love  
A road through a valley of darkness  
The islands that are not of this world  
He journeys on to find his love  
  
It is a long way through darkness  
To the way of the eremite  
To the eremite sings of the world and of  
The journey of love, which is not lost in eternity  
The Valley where the moon is caught in trees  
Water shows the hidden heart  
Endlong into midnight  
He journeys on  
The parable of day  
The Room of Books  
Where the winds come to him and say

We wish you a merry Christmas  
We wish you a merry Christmas  
We wish you a merry Christmas  
And a happy new year

So bring some right here  
  
We won't go until we get some

Ever close your eyes  
Ever stop and listen  
Ever feel alive  
And you've nothing missing  
You don't need a reason  
Let the day go on and on  
  
Let the rain fall down  
Everywhere around you  
Give into it now  
Let the day surround you  
You don't need a reason  
Let the rain go on and on  
  
[Chorus]  
What a day, what a day to take to  
What a way, what a way to make it through  
What a day, what a day to take to a wild child  
  
Only take the time  
From the helter skelter  
Every day you find  
Everything's in kilter  
You don't need a reason  
Let the day go on and on  
  
Every summer sun  
Every winter evening  
Every spring to come  
Every autumn leaving  
You don't need a reason  
Let it all go on and on  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
What a day, what a day to take to  
What a way, what a way to make it through  
What a day, what a day to take to  
  
What a way, what a way to make it through  
  
What a way, what a way to make it through  
What a day, what a day to take to a wild child  
What a day, what a day to take to a wild child
