Belle  
  
Is he gone?  
Oh, can you imagine?  
He asked me to marry him.  
Me, the wife of that boorish, brainless. ..  
  
"Madame Gaston!"  
Can't you just see it?  
"Madame Gaston!"  
His "little wife", ugh!  
No sir! Not me! I guarantee it!  
I want much more than this provincial life!  
I want adventure in the great wide somewhere  
I want it more than I can tell  
And for once it might be grand  
To have someone understand  
I want so much more than they've got planned

Gaston  
  
Who does she think she is?  
That girl has tangled with the wrong man!  
  
Lefou  
  
Darn right.  
  
Gaston  
  
No one says "no" to Gaston!  
Dismissed! Rejected!  
Publicly humiliated!  
Why, it's more than I can bear.  
  
Lefou  
  
More beer?  
  
Gaston  
  
What for? Nothing helps.  
I'm disgraced.  
  
Lefou  
  
Who, you? Never!  
Gaston, you've got to pull yourself together.  
  
Lefou  
  
Gosh it disturbs me to see you, Gaston  
Looking so down in the dumps  
Ev'ry guy here'd love to be you, Gaston  
Even when taking your lumps  
There's no man in town as admired as you  
You're ev'ryone's favorite guy  
Ev'ryone's awed and inspired by you  
And it's not very hard to see why  
  
No one's slick as Gaston  
No one's quick as Gaston  
No one's neck's as incredibly thick as Gaston's  
For there's no man in town half as manly  
Perfect, a pure paragon!  
You can ask any Tom, dick or Stanley  
And they'll tell you whose team they prefer to be on  
  
Lefou and chorus  
  
No one's been like Gaston  
A king pin like Gaston  
  
Lefou  
  
No one's got a swell cleft in his chin like Gaston  
  
Gaston  
  
As a specimen, yes, I'm intimidating!  
  
Lefou and chorus  
  
My what a guy, that Gaston!  
Give five "hurrahs!" Give twelve "hip-hips!"  
  
Lefou  
  
Gaston is the best  
And the rest is all drips  
  
Chorus  
  
No one fights like Gaston  
Douses lights like Gaston  
  
Lefou  
  
In a wrestling match nobody bites like Gaston!  
  
Bimbettes  
  
For there's no one as burly and brawny  
  
Gaston  
  
As you see I've got biceps to spare  
  
Lefou  
  
Not a bit of him's scraggly or scrawny  
  
Gaston  
  
That's right!  
And ev'ry last inch of me's covered with hair  
  
Chorus  
  
No one hits like Gaston  
Matches wits like Gaston  
  
Lefou  
  
In a spitting match nobody spits like Gaston  
  
Gaston  
  
I'm especially good at expectorating!  
Ptoooie!  
  
Chorus  
  
Ten points for Gaston!  
  
Gaston  
  
When I was a lad  
I ate four dozen eggs  
Ev'ry morning to help me get large  
And now that I'm grown  
I eat five dozen eggs  
So I'm roughly the size of a barge!  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh, ahhh, wow!  
My what a guy, that Gaston!  
No one shoots like Gaston  
Makes those beauts like Gaston  
  
Lefou  
  
Then goes tromping around wearing boots like Gaston  
  
Gaston  
  
I use antlers in all of my decorating!  
  
Chorus  
  
My what a guy, Gaston!

Gaston  
  
Crazy old Maurice, hmmm?  
Crazy old Maurice...  
Lefou, I'm afraid I've been thinking  
  
Lefou  
  
A dangerous pastime  
  
Gaston  
  
I know.  
But that whacky old coot is Belle's father  
And his sanity's only "so-so"  
Now the wheels in my head have been turning  
Since I looked at that loony, old man  
See, I've promised myself I'd be married to Belle  
And right now I'm evolving a plan  
  
Gaston  
  
If I. .. (whisper)  
  
Lefou  
  
Yes?  
  
Gaston  
  
Then we. .. (whisper)  
  
Lefou  
  
No! Would she. ..  
  
Gaston  
  
(whisper) Guess!  
  
Lefou  
  
Now I get it!  
  
Both  
  
Let's go! No one plots like Gaston  
  
Gaston  
  
Takes cheap shots like Gaston  
  
Lefou  
  
Plans to persecute harmless crackpots like Gaston  
  
Gaston  
  
Yes, I'm endlessly, wildly resourceful  
  
Lefou  
  
As down to the depths you descend  
  
Gaston  
  
I won't even be mildly remorseful  
  
Both  
  
Just as long as I (you) get what I (you) want in the end  
  
Gaston  
  
Who has brains like Gaston?  
  
Lefou  
  
Entertains like Gaston?  
  
Both  
  
Who can make up these endless refrains like Gaston?  
And his marriage we soon will be celebrating  
My what a guy Gaston!

Home  
  
Yes, I made the choice  
For papa I will stay  
But I don't deserve to lose my freedom in this way  
You monster!  
  
If you think that what you've done is right  
Well then,  
You're a fool  
Think again  
  
Is this home?  
Is this where I should learn to be happy?  
Never dreamed  
That a home could be  
Dark and cold,  
I was told,  
Every day in my childhood  
Even when we grow old  
Home should be where the heart is  
Never were words so true  
My heart's far far, away  
Home is too.  
  
Is this home?  
Is this what I must learn to believe in?  
Try to find something good  
In this tragic place  
Just in case  
I should stay here forever  
Held in this empty space  
Oh, but, that won't be easy  
I know the reason why  
My heart's far, far, away  
Home's a lie  
  
What I'd give  
To return, to the life that I knew lately  
But I know  
That I can't, solve my problems going back  
  
Is this home?  
Am I here for a day or forever?  
Shut away from the world until  
Who knows when  
Oh but then  
As my life has been altered once it can change again  
Build higher walls around me  
Change every lock and key  
Nothing lasts nothing, holds all of me  
  
My heart's far far, away  
Home and, free

If I Can't Love Her  
  
Beast:  
And in my twisted face  
There's not the slightest trace  
Of anything that even hints of kindness  
And from my tortured shape  
No comfort, no escape  
I see, but deep within is utter blindness  
  
Hopeless  
As my dream dies  
As the time flies  
Love a lost illusion  
Helpless  
Unforgiven  
Cold and driven  
To this sad conclusion  
  
No beauty could move me  
No goodness improve me  
No power on earth, if I can't love her  
No passion could reach me  
No lesson could teach me  
How I could have loved her and make her love me too  
If I can't love her, then who?  
  
Long ago I should have seen  
All the things I could have been  
Careless and unthinking, I moved onward  
  
No pain could be deeper  
No life could be cheaper  
No point anymore, if I can't love her  
No spirit could win me  
No hope left within me  
Hope I could have loved her and that she'd set me free  
But it's not to be  
If I can't love her  
Let the world be done with me.

Gaston  
  
You've been dreaming, just one dream  
Nearly all your life  
Hoping, scheming, just one theme:  
Will you be a wife?  
Will you be some he-man's property?  
Good news!  
That he-man's me!  
This equation, girl plus man  
Doesn't help just you  
On occasion, women can  
Have their uses too  
Mainly to extend the fam'ly tree  
Pumpkin, extend with me!  
  
Gaston  
  
We'll be raising sons galore  
  
Belle  
  
Inconceivable!  
  
Gaston  
  
Each built six foot four!  
  
Belle  
  
Unbelievable!  
  
Gaston  
  
Each one stuffed with ev'ry Gaston gene!  
  
Belle  
  
I'm not hearing this!  
  
Gaston  
  
You'll be keeping house with pride!  
  
Belle  
  
Just incredible!  
  
Gaston  
  
Oh so gratified  
  
Belle  
  
So unweddable!  
  
Gaston  
  
That you are a part of this idyllic scene.  
  
(Spoken)  
Picture this: A rustic hunting lodge, my latest kill roasting over the fire,
my little wife massaging my feet, while the little  
Ones play on the floor with the dogs. We'll have six or seven!  
  
Belle  
  
Dogs?  
  
Gaston  
  
No, Belle!  
  
Strapping boys... Like me!  
  
Belle  
  
Imagine that!  
  
Gaston  
  
I can see that we will share  
All that love implies  
We shall be a perfect pair  
Rather like my thighs  
You are face to face with destiny!  
All roads lead to...  
The best things in life are...  
All's well that ends with me!  
Escape me?  
There's no way  
Certain as "Do, Re,"  
Belle, when you marry...  
  
(Spoken)  
So Belle, what would it be?  
Is it "yes", or is it "oh, yes"?  
  
Belle  
  
I... I just don't deserve you!  
  
Gaston  
  
Who does? Me!

Once upon a time, in a faraway land,  
A young Prince lived in a shining castle.  
Although he had everything his heart desired,  
The Prince was spoiled, selfish, and unkind.  
But then, one winter's night,  
An old beggar woman came to the castle  
And offered him a single rose In return for shelter from the bitter cold.  
Repulsed by her haggard appearance,  
The Prince sneered at the gift,  
And turned the old woman away.  
But she warned him not to be deceived by appearances,  
For Beauty is found within.  
And when he dismissed her again,  
The old woman's ugliness melted away  
To reveal a beautiful Enchantress.  
The Prince tried to apologize, but it was too late,  
For she had seen that there was no love in his heart.  
And as punishment,  
She transformed him into a hideous beast,  
And placed a powerful spell on the castle,  
And all who lived there.  
Ashamed of his monstrous form,  
The beast concealed himself inside his castle,  
With a magic mirror as his only window to the outside world.  
The Rose she had offered,  
Was truly an enchanted rose,  
Which would bloom for many years.  
If he could learn to love another,  
And earn her love in return  
By the time the last petal fell,  
Then the spell would be broken.  
If not, he would be doomed to remain a beast  
For all time.  
As the years passed,  
He fell into despair, and lost all hope,  
For who could ever learn to love... A Beast?
