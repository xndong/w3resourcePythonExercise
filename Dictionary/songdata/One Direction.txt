The end of the night  
We should say goodbye  
But we carry on  
While everyone's gone  
  
Never felt like this before  
Are we friends or are we more  
As I'm walking towards the door  
I'm not sure  
  
But baby if you say you want me to stay  
I'll change my mind  
'Cause I don't wanna know I'm walking away  
If you'll be mine  
Won't go, won't go  
So baby if you say you want me to stay  
Stay for the night  
I'll change my mind  
  
Lean in when you laugh  
We take photographs  
There's no music on  
But we dance along  
  
Never felt like this before  
Are we friends or are we more  
As I'm walking towards the door  
I'm not sure  
  
But baby if you say you want me to stay  
I'll change my mind  
'Cause I don't wanna know I'm walking away  
If you'll be mine  
Won't go, won't go  
So baby if you say you want me to stay  
Stay for the night  
I'll change my mind  
  
I'll change my mind  
  
Baby if you say you want me to stay  
I'll change my mind  
  
But baby if you say you want me to stay  
I'll change my mind  
'Cause I don't wanna know I'm walking away  
If you'll be mine  
Won't go, won't go  
So baby if you say you want me to stay  
Stay for the night  
I'll change my mind

HARRY:

Come on let me change your ticket home  
  
ZAYN:  
Don't play innocent

When you said you'd come over  
  
NIALL:  
Are we way past that  
Playing hard to get  
We did that when we were younger  
  
LOUIS:  
And you say  
"It's hard to keep a secret"  
Girl don't leave me all alone in this hotel

So you should probably stay here with me  
A couple more days  
Come on let me change your ticket home

We'll do it all  
Everything  
On our own  
We don't need  
Anything  
Or anyone  
If I lay here  
If I just lay here  
Would you lie with me  
And just forget the world?  
I don't quite know  
How to say  
How I feel  
Those three words  
Are said too much  
They're not enough  
If I lay here  
If I just lay here  
Would you lie with me  
And just forget the world?  
Forget what we're told  
Before we get too old  
Show me a garden  
That's bursting into life  
Let's waste time  
Chasing cars  
Around our heads  
I need your grace  
To remind me  
To find my own  
If I lay here  
If I just lay here  
Would you lie with me  
And just forget the world?  
Forget what we're told  
Before we get too old  
Show me a garden  
That's bursting into life  
All that I am  
All that I ever was  
Is here in your perfect eyes  
They're all I can see  
I don't know where  
Confused about how as well  
Just know that these things  
Will never change for us at all  
If I lay here  
If I just lay her  
Would you lie with me  
And just forget the world?

Been a lot of places  
I've been all around the world  
Seen a lot of faces  
Never knowing where I was  
  
On the horizon  
Oh, well, I know, I know, I know  
I know the sun will be rising  
Back home  
  
Living out of cases,  
Packing up and taking off  
Made a lot of changes  
But not forgetting who I was  
  
On the horizon  
Oh, well, I know, I know, I know,  
I know the moon will be rising  
Back home  
  
Don't forget where you belong, home  
Don't forget where you belong, home  
If you ever feel alone, don't  
You were never on your own  
And the proof is in this song  
  
I've been away for ages  
But I've got everything I need  
I'm flicking through the pages  
I've written in my memory  
  
I feel like I'm dreaming  
Oh, so I know, I know, I know,  
I know that I'm never leaving  
No, I won't go  
  
Don't forget where you belong, home  
Don't forget where you belong, home  
If you ever feel alone, don't  
You were never on your own  
And the proof is in this song  
  
Lights off when they should be on  
Even stars and skies above  
Short days when the nights are long  
When I think of the days I've gone  
Don't matter how far I've gone  
I'll always be around oh  
  
Don't forget where you belong, home  
Don't forget where you belong (don't forget it), home  
If you ever feel alone, don't  
You were never on your own  
Never, never  
  
Don't forget where you belong, home  
Don't forget where you belong (don't forget it), home  
If you ever feel alone, don't  
You were never on your own (you were never)  
And the proof is in this song  
  
Home  
Don't forget it  
Home  
If you ever feel alone, don't  
You were never on your own (you were never)  
And the proof is in this song  
  
Never forget it  
This song  
Don't forget it!  
No, I never forget it  
This song  
You were never

[Verse 1: Lunchmoney Lewis]  
Down  
Ever since you came around  
Everybody wanna drag us down  
Is it cause we look too happy?  
I'll never forget when you looked at me  
And told me it was all mine  
I remember that, like yesterday  
It was a summer night on the west side  
That was last summer, we had the best times, yeah  
We crossed paths like an intersection  
Now we both headed in one direction  
  
[Chorus: Liam and All]  
All my life, you stood by me when no one else was ever behind me  
All these lights, they can't blind me  
With your love, nobody can drag me down  
All my life, you stood by me when no one else was ever behind me  
All these lights, they can't blind me  
With your love, nobody can drag me down  
Nobody can drag me down  
Nobody can drag me down  
  
[Verse 2: Harry]  
I've got fire for a heart, I'm not scared of the dark  
You've never seen it look so easy  
I got a river for a soul, and baby you're a boat  
Baby you're my only reason  
  
[Verse 3: Louis]  
If I didn't have you there would be nothing left  
The shell of a man who could never be his best  
If I didn't have you I'd never see the sun  
You taught me how to be someone, yeah  
  
[Chorus: All]  
All my life you stood by me when no one else was ever behind me  
All these lights, they can't blind me  
With your love, nobody can drag me down  
Nobody can drag me down  
Nobody, nobody  
Nobody, nobody  
  
[Verse 4: Lunchmoney Lewis]  
She a work of art like Van Gogh  
I'm underground like Camp Lo  
Yeah I'm top of them pop charts  
But I'm still saggin' my pants low  
I don't do meetings, I cancel  
One D let me get some of them fans though  
Just a young nigga from Dade County  
Where they move chickens like Nando  
When I touch down in London town  
I be sippin' tea with Simon Cowell  
Fact, shout out to Skepta, we shut it down  
Y'all lame niggas can't drag me down  
  
[Chorus: All]  
All my life you stood by me when no one else was ever behind me  
All these lights, they can't blind me  
With your love, nobody can drag me down  
Nobody can drag me down  
Nobody can drag me down

I'm thinking of you tonight  
And there's nothing that I want more  
Than to be by your side  
And let you grab so tight to me  
As you whisper the words good night to me  
Late at night  
  
I love you, it's true  
You mean everything to me  
Words cannot explain how I feel  
I must be dreaming when I'm awake  
  
Your heart is fixing me  
Without saying anything  
My worries fall like rain  
As these melodies run through your veins  
Let me take you far - just hold onto me  
  
And we'll take this world and you will see  
That in the end, I'll be there for you  
  
I love you, it's true  
You mean everything to me  
Words cannot explain how I feel  
I must be dreaming when I'm awake  
  
There's a sunshine floating  
I see clearly now  
So clearly now  
There's so much more  
That I hoped I'd ever find  
  
I love you, it's true  
You mean everything to me  
Words cannot explain how I feel  
I must be dreaming when I'm awake

My minds at erase  
And my thoughts are done  
I've been meaning to tell you this  
Since my lies begun  
The way I feel inside  
Reflects of the souls in your eyes  
I've been meaning to tell you this  
All of my life  
To think of who I am  
Shows much of what you were too  
Slowly I realize  
I'll be fine without you  
I gave you your chances  
And you just put them aside  
To find out too late  
Of who I am inside  
  
Show me yourself come show me who you are  
These are the times we wish it never went this far  
Hidden by your words oh god please let me see  
How someone plays with feelings oh so carelessly  
Give me your heart to come and be in one  
Vulnerable I was please come and steal and run  
Just as we laughed, kissed I looked deep in your eyes  
To tell you how I felt, came one without reply  
  
Echos is all I hear I'm running, I'm running, I'm running  
Let go is all I fear I'm running, I'm running, I'm running  
Let go  
I can't let go  
So fall away is what I'll do  
It's what I'll do  
It's what I'll do  
It's what I'll do  
It's what I'll do  
It's what I'll do

[Verse 1]  
  
[Harry]  
I think I'm gonna lose my mind  
Something deep inside me I can't give up  
I think I'm gonna lose my mind  
I roll and I roll till I'm out of luck  
I roll and I roll till I'm out of luck  
  
[Niall]  
I'm feeling something deep inside  
Hotter than the dead stream burning up  
I got a feeling deep inside  
It's taking, it's taking all I've got  
Yeah, it's taking, its taking all I've got  
  
[Chorus]  
[Zayn]  
Cos nobody knows you baby the way I do  
Cos nobody loves you baby the way I do  
It's been so long, it's been so long  
Maybe we're fireproof  
  
[Liam]  
Cos nobody sees me baby the way you do  
  
[Verse 2]  
  
[Louis]  
I think I'm gonna win this time  
Riding on a wind and I won't give up  
I think I'm gonna win this time  
I roll and I roll till I change my luck  
I roll and I roll till I change my luck  
  
[Zayn]  
Cos nobody knows you baby the way I do  
And nobody loves you baby the way I do  
It's been so long, it's been so long  
You must be fireproof  
Cos nobody sees me baby the way you do  
  
[Bridge]  
[All]  
Cos nobody knows you baby the way I do  
And nobody loves you baby the way I do  
  
[Outro]  
  
[Zayn]  
It's been so long it's been so long  
  
[Harry]  
Maybe we're fireproof  
Cos nobody sees me baby the way you do

[Liam]  
Let's dance in style,  
Let's dance for a while,  
Heaven can wait, we're only watching the skies,  
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst,  
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?  
  
[Harry]  
Let us die young or let us live forever,  
We don't have the power but we never say never,  
Sitting in a sandpit,  
Life is a short trip,  
The music's for the sad man.  
  
[All]  
Forever young,  
I wanna be  
Forever young.  
Do you really wanna live forever,  
Forever,  
Forever young?  
  
[Niall]  
Some are like water, some are like the heat,  
Some are a melody and some are the beat,  
But sooner or later they all will be gone,  
Why don't they stay young?  
  
[Harry]  
It's hard to get old without a cause,  
I don't want to perish like a fading horse,  
Youth is like diamonds in the sun,  
And diamonds are forever.  
  
[All]  
Forever young,  
I wanna be  
Forever young.  
Do you really wanna live forever,  
Forever  
Or never?  
Forever young,  
I wanna be  
Forever young (forever).  
Do you really wanna live forever,  
Forever  
Or never?  
  
[Liam]  
So many adventures couldn't happen today,  
So many songs we forgot to play,  
So many dreams are swinging out of the blue,  
We let 'em come true.  
  
[Harry]  
Forever young,  
I wanna be  
Forever young.  
Do you really wanna live forever,  
Forever  
Or never?  
  
[All]  
Forever young,  
I wanna be  
Forever young.  
Do you really wanna live forever,  
Forever  
Or never?  
Forever young,  
I wanna be  
Forever young (forever).  
Do you really wanna live forever (forever),  
Forever  
Or never?  
Forever young,  
I wanna be  
Forever young (forever).  
Do you really wanna live forever (forever),  
Forever (forever),  
Forever young...  
[Fades]

In Mullingar, Westmeath born and raised  
At Nando's, is where I spent most of my days  
Chilling out, Maxing, Relaxing all cool then I go eat  
Some chicken outside the school.  
When a couple of chavs, they were up to no good  
They started making trouble in my neighborhood.  
I got in one little fight and my mom started objectin'  
She said "Your moving to London and joining one direction.  
I made it through auditions, thanks to Katy Perry  
And that's where I met Lou, Zayn, Liam, and Harry.  
And now who would've thought that we've come this far!  
I'm sure as hell not going back to Mullingar.

[Verse 1: Liam]  
Her light is as loud as as many ambulances  
As it takes just to save a savior, oh  
Woah, woah, woah  
  
[Verse 2: Harry Styles]  
No, she floats through the room on a big balloon  
Some say she's such a fake  
That her love is made up, no  
No, no, no  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Niall Horan]  
Let's have another toast to the girl almighty  
Let's pray we stay young, stay made of lightning  
  
[Chorus]  
[Zayn] Am I the only  
Only believer?  
[All Members]  
(Da da da da)  
There's something happening here  
There's something happening here  
[Zayn] The only, only believer  
[All Members]  
There's something happening here  
I hope you feel what I'm feeling too  
I'd get down, I'd get down  
I'd get down on my knees for you  
I'd get down, I'd get down  
I'd get down on my knees  
I'd get down on my knees for you  
  
[Verse 1: Louis Tomlinson]  
Her light is as loud as as many ambulances  
As it takes just to save a savior, oh  
Woah, woah, woah  
  
[Verse 2: Niall Horan]  
No, she floats through the room on a big balloon  
Some say she's such a fake  
That her love is made up, no  
No, no, no  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Harry Styles]  
Let's have another toast to the girl almighty  
[Louis Tomlinson]  
Let's pray we stay young, stay made of lightning  
  
[Chorus]  
[Zayn] Am I the only  
Only believer?  
[All Members]  
(Da da da da)  
There's something happening here  
There's something happening here  
[Zayn] The only, only believer  
[All Members]  
There's something happening here  
I hope you feel what I'm feeling too  
I'd get down, I'd get down  
I'd get down on my knees for you  
I'd get down, I'd get down  
I'd get down on my knees  
I'd get down on my knees for you

[Liam:]  
Girl I see it in your eyes you're disappointed  
'Cause I'm the foolish one that you anointed with your heart  
I tore it apart  
And girl what a mess I made upon your innocence  
And no woman in the world deserves this  
But here I am asking you for one more chance  
  
[Harry:]  
Can we fall, one more time?  
Stop the tape and rewind  
Oh and if you walk away I know I'll fade  
Cause there is nobody else  
  
It's gotta be you  
Only you  
It's gotta be you  
Only you  
  
[Liam:]  
Now girl I hear it in your voice and how it trembles  
When you speak to me I don't resemble, who I was  
You've almost had enough  
And your actions speak louder than words  
And you're about to break from all you've heard  
Don't be scared, I ain't going no where  
  
[Zayn:]  
I'll be here, by your side  
No more fears, no more crying  
But if you walk away  
I know I'll fade  
'Cause there is nobody else  
  
It's gotta be you  
Only you  
It's gotta be you  
Only you  
  
[Zayn:]  
Oh girl, can we try one more, one more time?  
One more, one more, can we try?  
One more, one more time  
I'll make it better  
One more, one more, can we try?  
One more, one more  
Can we try one more time to make it all better?  
  
[Harry:]  
'Cause it's gotta be you  
It's gotta be you  
Only you  
Only you  
  
It's gotta be you  
Only you  
It's gotta be you  
Only you

So your friend's been telling me  
You've been sleeping with my sweater  
And that you can't stop missing me  
Bet my friend's been telling you  
I'm not doing much better  
'Cause I'm missing half of me  
  
And being here without you is like I'm waking up to  
  
Only half a blue sky  
Kinda there but not quite  
I'm walking around with just one shoe  
I'm half a heart without you  
I'm half a man at best,  
With half an arrow in my chest  
I miss everything we do,  
I'm half a heart without you  
  
Forget all we said that night  
No, it doesn't even matter  
'Cause we both got split in two  
If you could spare an hour or so,  
We'll go for lunch down by the river  
We can really talk it through  
  
And being here without you is like I'm waking up to  
  
Only half a blue sky  
Kinda there but not quite  
I'm walking around with just one shoe  
I'm half a heart without you  
I'm half a man at best,  
With half an arrow in my chest  
'Cause I miss everything we do,  
I'm half a heart without you  
  
Half a heart without you,  
I'm half a heart without you  
  
Though I try to get you out of my head  
The truth is I got lost without you  
And since then I've been waking up to  
  
Only half a blue sky  
Kinda there but not quite  
I'm walking around with just one shoe  
I'm half a heart without you  
I'm half a man at best,  
With half an arrow in my chest  
I miss everything we do,  
I'm half a heart without you  
  
Without you, without you, half a heart without you  
Without you, without you, I'm half a heart without you

Baby, you got me sick  
I don't know what I did  
Need to take a break and figure it out, yeah  
  
Got your voice in my head  
Saying let's just be friends  
Can't believe the words came out of your mouth  
  
I'm trying to be okay, I'm trying to be alright  
But seeing you with him just don't feel right  
  
And I'm like  
Ow, never thought it'd hurt so bad  
Getting over you  
Ow, you're giving me a heart attack  
Looking like you do  
'Cause you're all I ever wanted  
Thought you would be the one that's  
Ow, giving me a heart attack  
Getting over you  
  
Baby, now that you're gone  
I can't stand dumb love songs  
Missing you is all I'm thinking about, yeah  
Everyone's telling me I'm just too blind to see  
How you messed me up, I'm better off now  
  
I'm trying to be okay, I'm trying to be alright  
But seeing you with him just don't feel right  
  
And I'm like  
Ow, never thought it'd hurt so bad  
Getting over you  
Ow, you're giving me a heart attack  
Looking like you do  
'Cause you're all I ever wanted  
Thought you would be the one that's  
Ow, giving me a heart attack  
Getting over you  
  
Every time you look like that  
You're giving me a heart attack  
'Cause seeing you with him just don't feel right  
  
Ow, never thought it'd hurt so bad  
Getting over you  
Ow, you're giving me a heart attack  
Looking like you do  
'Cause you're all I ever wanted  
Thought you would be the one that's  
Ow, giving me a heart attack  
Getting over you  
  
You're all I ever wanted  
Every time you look like that  
You're all I ever wanted  
You're giving me a heart attack

[Verse 1: Liam]  
Make a little conversation  
So long I've been waiting  
To let go of myself and feel alive  
  
[Niall]  
So many nights I thought it over  
Told myself I kind of liked her  
But there was something missing in her eyes  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Harry]  
I was stumbling, looking in the dark  
With an empty heart  
But you say you feel the same  
Could we ever be enough?  
Baby we could be enough  
  
[Chorus: All]  
And it's alright  
Calling out for somebody to hold tonight  
When you're lost, I'll find a way  
I'll be your light  
You'll never feel like you're alone  
  
[Louis]  
I'll make this feel like home  
  
[Verse 2: Niall]  
So hot that I couldn't take it  
Want to wake up and see your face  
And remember how good it was being here last night  
  
[Louis]  
Still high with a little feeling  
I see the smile as it starts to creep in  
It was there, I saw it in your eyes  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Harry]  
I was stumbling, looking in the dark  
With an empty heart  
But you say you feel the same  
Could we ever be enough?  
Baby we could be enough  
  
[Chorus: All]  
And it's alright  
Calling out for somebody to hold tonight  
When you're lost, I'll find a way  
I'll be your light  
You'll never feel like you're alone  
  
[Louis]  
I'll make this feel like home  
I'll make this feel like home  
  
[Harry]  
Baby we could be enough  
  
[All]  
It's alright  
Calling out for somebody to hold tonight  
When you're lost, I'll find a way  
I'll be your light  
You'll never feel like you're alone  
  
[Louis]  
I'll make this feel like home

I keep playing it inside my head,  
All that you said to me.  
I lie awake just to convince myself,  
This wasn't just a dream.  
  
'Cause you were right here,  
And I should've taken the chance.  
But I got so scared,  
And I lost the moment again.  
It's all that I can think about,  
Oh, you're all that I can think about  
  
Is your heart taken?  
Is there somebody else on your mind?  
I'm so sorry, I'm so confused,  
Just tell me, am I out of time?  
Is your heart breaking?  
How do you feel about me now?  
I can't believe I let you walk away when  
When, I should have kissed you  
  
I should, I should, oh, I should have kissed you  
I should, I should, oh, I should have kissed you  
I should, I should, oh, I should have kissed you  
I should, I should, oh, I should have kissed you  
  
Every morning when I leave my house,  
I always look for you.  
Yeah, I see you every time I close my eyes,  
What am I gonna go?  
  
And all my friends say that I'm punching over my weight  
But in my eyes i saw how you're looking at me  
It's all that I can think about,  
Oh, you're all that I can think about  
  
Is your heart taken?  
Is there somebody else on your mind?  
I'm so sorry, I'm so confused,  
Just tell me, am I out of time?  
Is your heart breaking?  
How do you feel about me now?  
I cant believe I let you walk away when  
When, I should have kissed you  
  
I should, I should, oh, I should have kissed you  
I should, I should, oh, I should have kissed you  
I should, I should, oh, I should have kissed you  
I should, I should, oh, I should have kissed you  
  
When you stood there, just a heartbeat away  
When we were dancing, and you looked up at me  
If I had known then that I'd be feeling this way  
If I could replay I would never have let you go  
No, oh, never have let you go  
Am I out of time?  
  
Is your heart taken?  
Is there somebody else on your mind?  
I'm so sorry, I'm so confused,  
Just tell me, am I out of time?  
Is your heart breaking?  
How do you feel about me now?  
I cant believe I let you walk away when  
When, I should have kissed you  
  
I should, I should, oh, I should have kissed you  
I should, I should, oh, I should have kissed you  
I should, I should, oh, I should have kissed you  
I should, I should, oh, I should have kissed you  
I should have kissed you

[Verse 1: Harry]  
I wanna write you a song  
One that's beautiful as you are sweet  
With just a hint of pain for the feeling that I get when you are gone  
I wanna write you a song  
  
[Verse 1: Liam]  
I wanna lend you my coat  
One that's as soft as your cheek  
So when the world is cold you'll have a hiding place you can go  
I wanna lend you my coat  
  
[Chorus: Louis]  
Everything I need I get from you  
And giving back is all I wanna do  
  
[Verse 2: Liam]  
I wanna build you a boat  
One that's strong as you are free  
So any time you think that your heart is gonna sink, you know it won't  
I wanna build you a boat  
  
[Chorus: Louis]  
Everything I need I get from you  
And giving back is all I wanna do  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
[Chorus: Harry]  
Everything I need I get from you  
And giving back is all I wanna do  
  
[Verse 3: Niall]  
I wanna write you a song  
One to make your heart remember me  
So any time I'm gone, you can listen to my voice and sing along  
I wanna write you a song, I wanna write you a song

Lately I found myself thinking  
Been dreaming about you a lot  
And up in my head I'm your boyfriend  
But that's one thing you've already got  
  
He drives to school every morning  
While I walk alone in the rain  
He'd kill me without any warning  
If he took a look in my brain  
  
Would he say he's in L-O-V-E?  
Well if it was me then I would, I would  
Would he hold you when you're feeling low  
Baby you should know that I would, I would  
Would he say he's in L-O-V-E?  
Well if it was me then I would  
Would he hold you when you're feeling low  
Baby you should know that I would  
  
Back in my head we were kissing  
I thought things were going alright  
With a sign on my back saying kick me  
Reality ruined my life  
  
Feels like I'm constantly playing  
A game that I'm destined to lose  
Cause I can't compete with your boyfriend  
He's got 27 tattoos  
  
Would he say he's in L-O-V-E?  
Well if it was me then I would  
Would he hold you when you're feeling low  
Baby you should know that I would  
Would he say he's in L-O-V-E?  
Well if it was me then I would  
Would he hold you when you're feeling low  
Baby you should know that I would  
  
Would he please you?  
Would he kiss you?  
Would he treat you like I would?  
Would he touch you?  
Would he need you?  
Would he love you like I would?  
  
Would he say he's in L-O-V-E?  
Well if it was me then I would  
Would he hold you when you're feeling low  
Baby you should know that I would  
  
Would he please you?  
Would he kiss you?  
Would he treat you like I would?  
Would he touch you?  
Would he need you?  
Would he love you like I would?  
  
Would he say he's in L-O-V-E?  
Well if it was me then  
I would, I would  
Would he hold you when you're feeling low  
Baby you should know that I would  
  
I would, I would yeah.

Tell me you believe in love  
It's not an illusion...  
  
[Verse 1: Liam:]  
I've been thinking about the nights  
And the dangerous tricks people play on the eyes of the innocent  
I could turn a lot of hearts into breaks with smoke  
And mirrors disappearing right in front of them  
  
[Hook: Harry]  
But believe me, I'm not trying to deceive you  
I promise falling for me won't be a mistake  
  
[Chorus: Zayn]  
No baby, this is not an illusion  
I've really got my heart out on my sleeve  
Oh baby, this is not an illusion  
There's magic between you and me  
No baby, this is not an illusion  
You've really got me lifted off my feet  
So tell me you believe in love  
'Cause it's not an illusion to me  
  
[Verse 2: Liam]  
You don't ever have to worry about me, about how the cards fall  
I'm all that you need tonight  
I would never turn your heart into broken parts  
You don't have to think twice looking in my eyes  
  
[Hook: Louis]  
Can't you see it? I'm not trying to mislead you  
I promise falling for me won't be a mistake  
  
[Chorus: Zayn]  
No baby, this is not an illusion  
I've really got my heart out on my sleeve  
Oh baby, this is not an illusion  
There's magic between you and me  
No baby, this is not an illusion  
You've really got me lifted off my feet  
So tell me you believe in love  
'Cause it's not an illusion to me  
  
[Bridge: Niall]  
You can tie me up in chains  
You can throw away the key  
But there's no trap doors, I'm not gonna leave  
You're the truth I can't explain  
You're the only one I see  
It's not an illusion to me  
  
[Chorus: All]  
No baby, this is not an illusion  
I've really got my heart out on my sleeve  
Oh baby, this is not an illusion  
There's magic between you and me  
No baby, this is not an illusion  
You've really got me lifted off my feet  
So tell me you believe in love  
'Cause it's not an illusion to me  
So tell me you believe in love  
'Cause it's not an illusion

Well you done done me and you bet I felt it  
I tried to beat you but you're so hot that I melted  
I fell right through the cracks, now I'm trying to get back  
  
Before the cool done run out, I'll be giving it my bestest  
And nothings going to stop me but divine intervention  
I reckon it's again my turn to win some or learn some  
  
But I won't hesitate no more, no more  
It cannot wait, I'm yours  
  
Well open up your mind and see like me  
Open up your plans and damn you're free  
Look into your heart and you'll find love, love, love  
  
Listen to the music of the moment people dance and sing  
We're just one big family, and  
It's our god-forsaken right to be loved, love, loved, love, loved  
  
So I won't hesitate no more, no more  
It cannot wait I'm sure  
There's no need to complicate, our time is short  
This is our fate, I'm yours  
  
D-d-do you, but you, d-d-do  
But do you want to come on  
Scooch on over closer dear  
And I will nibble your ear  
  
I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror  
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer  
But my breath fogged up the glass  
And so I drew a new face and laughed  
  
I guess what I'm saying is there ain't no better reason  
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons  
It's what we aim to do, our name is our virtue  
  
But I won't hesitate no more, no more  
It cannot wait I'm yours  
  
Come on and open up your mind and see like me  
Open up your plans and damn you're free  
Look into your heart and you'll find that the sky is yours  
  
So please don't, please don't, please don't  
There's no need to complicated  
Cause our time is short  
This is, this is, this is our fate, I'm yours!

[Verse 1: Niall Horan]  
Down to Earth  
Keep on falling when I know it hurts  
Going faster than a million miles an hour  
Trying to catch my breath some way, somehow  
Down to Earth  
It's like I'm frozen, but the world still turns  
Stuck in motion, but the wheels keep spinning 'round  
Moving in reverse with no way out  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Liam Payne]  
And now I'm one step closer to being  
Two steps far from you  
When everybody wants you  
Everybody wants you  
  
[Chorus: Harry Styles]  
How many nights does it take to count the stars?  
That's the time it would take to fix my heart  
Oh, baby, I was there for you  
All I ever wanted was the truth, yeah, yeah  
How many nights have you wished someone would stay?  
Lie awake only hoping they're okay  
I never counted all of mine  
If I tried, I know it would feel like infinity  
Infinity, infinity, yeah  
Infinity  
  
[Verse 2: Liam Payne]  
Eyes can't shine  
Unless there's something burning bright behind  
Since you went away, there's nothing left in mine  
I feel myself running out of time  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Louis Tomlinson]  
And now I'm one step closer to being  
Two steps far from you  
When everybody wants you  
Everybody wants you  
  
[Chorus: Harry Styles]  
How many nights does it take to count the stars?  
That's the time it would take to fix my heart  
Oh, baby, I was there for you  
All I ever wanted was the truth, yeah, yeah  
How many nights have you wished someone would stay?  
Lie awake only hoping they're okay  
I never counted all of mine  
If I tried, I know it would feel like infinity  
Infinity, infinity, yeah  
Infinity  
  
[Chorus: Harry Styles]  
How many nights does it take to count the stars?  
That's the time it would take to fix my heart  
Oh, baby, I was there for you  
All I ever wanted was the truth, yeah, yeah  
How many nights have you wished someone would stay?  
Lie awake only hoping they're okay  
I never counted all of mine  
If I tried, I know it would feel like infinity  
Infinity, infinity, yeah  
Infinity

Friday night and everyone's moving.  
I can feel the heat but it's soothing.  
Heading down, I search for the beat in this dirty town.  
  
Down town the young ones are going.  
Down town the young ones are growing.  
  
We're the kids in America.  
We're the kids in America.  
Everybody live for the music-go-round.  
  
Bright ligths the music get faster.  
Look boy, don't check on your watch, not another glance.  
I'm not leaving now, honey not a chance.  
  
We're the kids in America.  
We're the kids in America.  
Everybody live for the music-go-round.  
  
We're the kids  
We're the kids  
We're the kids in America  
  
We're the kids in America.  
We're the kids in America.  
Everybody live for the music-go-round.

Girl, it should be me  
Driving to your house  
Knocking on your door  
Kissing you on the mouth  
Holding on your hand  
Dancing in the dark  
'Cause I was the only one who loved you from the start  
  
But now when I see you with him it  
Tears my world apart  
  
Because,  
I've been waiting  
All this time to finally say it  
But now I see your heart's been taken  
And nothing could be worse  
Baby, I loved you first.  
Had my chances  
Could've been where he is standing  
That's what hurts the most,  
Girl, I came so close  
But now you'll never know  
Baby, I loved you first (I loved you first, loved you first)  
  
Girl, it should be me  
Calling on your phone  
Saying you're the one, and that I'll never let you go  
I never understood, what love was really like,  
But I felt it for the first time looking in your eyes  
But now when I see you with him  
My whole world falls apart  
  
Because,  
I've been waiting  
All this time to finally say it  
But now I see your heart's been taken  
And nothing could be worse  
Baby, I loved you first.  
Had my chances  
Could've been where he is standing  
That's what hurts the most  
Girl, I came so close  
But now you'll never know  
Baby, I loved you first  
  
The first touch  
The first kiss  
First girl to make me feel like this  
Heartbreak  
It's killing me  
I loved you first, why can't you see?  
  
I've been waiting all this time to finally say it  
But now I see your heart's been taken  
And nothing could be worse  
Baby, I loved you first.  
  
Had my chances  
Could've been where he is standing  
That's what hurts the most  
Girl, I came so close  
But now you'll never know  
Baby, I loved you first  
  
Baby, I loved you first  
Baby, I loved you first  
Oh, yeah  
Baby, I loved you first

B-b-b-baby c'mon over  
I don't care if people find out (dada, dadada, da, da, da, da)  
They say that we're no good together  
And it's never gonna work out (dada, dadada, da, da, da, da)  
  
But baby you got me moving too fast  
'Cause I know you wanna be bad  
And girl when you're lookin' like that (dada, dadada)  
I can't hold back.  
  
'Cause you, you've got this spell on me  
I don't know what to believe  
Kiss you once now I can't leave  
'Cause everything you do is magic  
But everything you do is magic.  
  
So l-l-let them take the pictures  
Spread it all around the world now (dada, dadada, da, da, da, da)  
I wanna put it on my record  
I want everyone to know now (dada, dadada, da, da, da, da)  
  
But baby you got me moving too fast  
'Cause I know you wanna be bad  
And girl when you're lookin' like that (dada, dadada)  
I can't hold back.  
  
'Cause you, you've got this spell on me

Kiss you once now I can't leave

But everything you do is magic.

And it's never gonna work out

Everything you do is magic

I'm gonna make a change,  
For once in my life  
It's gonna feel real good,  
Gonna make a diference  
Gonna make it right...  
  
As I, turn up the collar on  
My favorite winter coat  
This wind is blowing my mind  
I see the kids in the streets,  
With not enought to eat  
Who am I to be blind?  
Pretending not to see their needs  
  
A summer disregard, a broken bottle top  
And a one man soul  
They follow each other on the wind ya' know  
'Cause they got nowhere to go  
That's why I want you to know  
  
I'm starting with the man in the mirror  
I'm asking him to change his ways  
And no message could have been any clearer  
If you wanna make the world a better place  
Take a look at yourself, and then make a change  
(Na na na, na na na, na na, na nah)

Guess this means you're sorry  
You're standing at my door  
Guess this means you take back  
All you said before  
Like how much you wanted  
Anyone but me  
Said you'd never come back  
But here you are again  
  
'Cause we belong together now, yeah  
Forever united here somehow, yeah  
You got a piece of me  
And honestly,  
My life (my life) would suck (would suck) without you  
'Cause we belong together now, yeah  
Forever united here somehow, yeah  
You got a piece of me  
And honestly,  
My life (my life) would suck (would suck) without you

We've got a bit of love hate  
Take me to the edge then you hit the breaks  
I say it's over one day  
Then I'm crawling back begging you to stay  
  
Makeup then we breakup all the time  
  
Say that I hate a song  
Then you go request it the whole night long  
Some people say it's so wrong  
But even when we fight girl you turn me on  
  
Makeup then we breakup all the time  
  
We're like  
Na na na

'Cause when we think we got it right

You were at a party too late  
When I do the same all you do is complain  
You know that it drives me insane  
But when I get with you girl you make it okay

I'm at a Nando's, trying to Paul home  
All of my change I spent on Lou  
Where have his socks gone?  
Niall it's all wrong  
You ate the food we made for 2  
Yeah, I know it's hard to remember that they tried out separately  
It's even harder to picture, they placed at number 3  
Harry loves to get naked, but the boys never mind  
As soon as they got famous, all the fan girls broke down  
Twitcams make me smile  
Someone should tell Niall to hide his profile  
I'd let Larry Stylinson prank call my friends  
Six are: s in Terrance  
Zayn's no pedophile  
I'm at a Nando's, trying to Paul home  
All of my change I spent on Lou  
Where have his socks gone?  
Niall it's all wrong  
You ate the food we made for 2  
Everytime I read a new fanfic  
Louis munching on some carrot sticks  
Why is Harry's hair always perfect?  
Liam's only got 1 kidney left  
Yeah, we better thank Simon Cowell for making the boys stay  
Louis drove the van so slow  
They got stopped twice that day  
Zayn has such beautiful eyes  
And perfectly coiffed hair  
There are women in Sweden  
Who wouldn't put their shirts down  
Video diaries  
Superman Louis  
Liam love Danielle Pea-zer and  
Zayn loves Perrie  
Niall and his guitar  
Louis and Eleanor  
The kazoo and Harry  
I'm at a Nando's, trying to Paul home  
All of my change I spent on Lou  
Where have his socks gone?  
Niall it's all wrong  
You ate the food we made for 2  
Zayn should probably work on his dance moves  
Niall is a big fan of the zoo  
Harry used to share a flat with Lou  
Liam won't go near another spoon  
Now I'm at a Nando's

[Verse 1: Liam]  
Wanna pull an all nighter and get into something we'll never forget  
Wanna stay up and party the weekend away and not know when to quit  
Wanna drive in the night to the end of the earth and go over the edge  
Wanna wake up with you and say baby let's do it all over again  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Niall]  
Lips so good I forget my name  
I swear I could give you everything  
  
[Chorus: All]  
I don't need my love, you can take it, you can take it, take it  
I don't need my heart, you can break it, you can break it, break it  
I just can't get too much of you, baby, it's never, it's never enough  
Never enough, it's never enough, never enough  
Come on, come on  
  
[Verse 2: Niall]  
Wanna pull an all nighter and get into something we'll never forget  
Wanna stay up and party the weekend away and not know when to quit  
Wanna drive in the night to the end of the earth and go over the edge  
Wanna wake up with you and say baby let's do it all over again  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Louis]  
Lips so good I forget my name  
I swear I could give you everything  
  
[Chorus: All]  
I don't need my love, you can take it, you can take it, take it  
I don't need my heart, you can break it, you can break it, break it  
I just can't get too much of you, baby, it's never, it's never enough  
Never enough, it's never enough, never enough  
Come on, come on  
Come on, come on  
  
[Bridge]  
Too much is never enough, too much is never enough  
Too much is never enough, too much  
Too much is never enough, too much is never enough  
Too much is never enough, too much is never enough  
Never enough, never enough  
Never enough, never enough  
  
[Chorus: All]  
I don't need my love, you can take it, you can take it, take it  
I don't need my heart, you can break it, you can break it, break it  
I just can't get too much of you, baby, it's never, it's never enough  
Never enough, it's never enough, never enough  
I don't need my love, you can take it, you can take it, take it  
I don't need my heart, you can break it, you can break it, break it  
I just can't get too much of you, baby, it's never, it's never enough  
Never enough, it's never enough, never enough  
Come on, come on  
Come on, come on

In West Philadelphia I was born and raised  
On the playground is where I spent most of my days  
Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin' all cool,  
And all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school  
  
When a couple of guys who where up to no good  
Started makin' trouble in my neighborhood  
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared,  
And said "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in bell air".

You're insecure,  
Don't know what for,  
You're turning heads when you walk through the door,  
Don't need make-up, to cover up,  
Being the way that you are is enough  
  
Everyone else in the room can see it,  
Everyone else but you  
  
Baby you light up my world like nobody else,  
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed,  
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell,  
You don't know, oh oh,  
You don't know you're beautiful,  
If only you saw what I can see,  
You'll understand why I want you so desperately,  
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe,  
You don't know, oh oh,  
You don't know you're beautiful, oh oh,  
That's what makes you beautiful  
  
So come on, you got it wrong,  
To prove I'm right, I put it in a song,  
I don't know why, you're being shy,  
And turn away when I look into your eye eye eyes  
  
Everyone else in the room can see it,  
Everyone else but you  
  
Baby you light up my world like nobody else,  
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed,  
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell,  
You don't know, oh oh,  
You don't know you're beautiful,  
If only you saw what I can see,  
You'll understand why I want you so desperately,  
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe,  
You don't know, oh oh,  
You don't know you're beautiful, oh oh,  
That's what makes you beautiful  
  
(Na na na na na na na)  
  
Baby you light up my world like nobody else,  
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed,  
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell,  
You don't know, oh oh,  
You don't know you're beautiful  
  
Baby you light up my world like nobody else,  
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed,  
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell,  
You don't know, oh oh,  
You don't know you're beautiful,  
If only you saw what I can see,  
You'll understand why I want you so desperately,  
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe,  
You don't know, oh oh,  
You don't know you're beautiful, oh oh,  
You don't know you're beautiful, oh oh,  
That's what makes you beautiful

[Verse 1: Niall Horan]  
Counted all my mistakes and there's only one  
Standing out from the list of the things I've done  
All the rest of my crimes don't come close  
To the look on your face when I let you go  
So I built you a house from a broken home  
And I wrote you a song with the words you spoke  
It took me some time but I figured out  
How to fix up a heart that I let down  
  
[Chorus:]  
Now I'm searching every lonely place  
Every corner calling out your name  
Tryin to find you but I just don't know  
Where do broken hearts go?  
Where do broken hearts go?  
  
[Verse 2: Liam Payne]  
Yeah, the taste of your lips on the tip of my tongue  
Is at the top of the list of the things I want  
Mind is running in circles of you and me  
Anyone in between is the enemy  
  
[Verse 3: Harry Styles]  
Shadows come with the pain that you're running from  
Love was something you never heard enough  
Yeah it took me some time but I figured out  
How to fix up a heart that I let down  
  
[Chorus:]  
Now I'm searching every lonely place  
Every corner calling out your name  
Tryin to find you but I just don't know  
Where do broken hearts go?  
  
Are you sleeping baby by yourself  
Or are you giving it to someone else  
Tryin to find you but I just don't know  
Where do broken hearts go?  
Where do broken hearts go?  
  
[Bridge: Harry Styles]  
Tell me now, tell me now  
Tell me where you go when you feel afraid  
Tell me now, tell me now  
Tell me will you ever love me again, love me again  
  
[Chorus:]  
Now I'm searching every lonely place  
Every corner calling out your name  
Tryin to find you but I just don't know  
Where do broken hearts go?  
  
Are you sleeping baby by yourself  
Or are you giving it to someone else  
Tryin to find you but I just don't know  
  
(Louis Tomlinson)  
Where do broken hearts go?  
Tell me where you're hiding out  
Where do broken hearts go  
  
Come on baby, cause I need you now  
  
(Louis Tomlinson)  
Where do broken hearts go  
Tell me cause I'm ten feet down  
  
Where do broken hearts go  
Come on baby, come and get me out  
Come on baby, come and get me out  
Come on baby, cause I need you now  
  
Where do broken hearts go  
Where do broken hearts go  
Where do broken hearts go  
Where do broken hearts go

It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside  
I'm not one of those who can easily hide  
I don't have much money, but boy if I did  
I'd buy a big house where we both could live  
  
And you can tell everybody this is your song  
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done  
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind that  
I put down in words  
How wonderful life is while you're in the world  
  
I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss  
Well, a few of the verses, well, they've got me quite cross  
But the sun's been quite kind while  
I wrote this song  
It's for people like you that keep it turned on  
  
And you can tell everybody this is your song  
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done  
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind that I put down in words  
How wonderful life is while you're in the world
