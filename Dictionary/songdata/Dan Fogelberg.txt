You know that everybody has a voice  
And how they use it is their own free choice  
In your glory I will not rejoice  
If you choose the ways of war  
If you choose the ways of war  
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust  
My country 'tis of thee, in God we trust  
But how much longer will he shelter us  
While we choose the ways of war  
While the winds of war rage on  
Let mine "oh let my small voice" be a voice for peace  
Oh let mine "oh let my small voice" be a voice for peace  
Oh let mine "oh let my small voice" be a voice for peace  
Let it start here with me, oh let mine be a voice for peace  
The good book tells us thou shalt not kill  
The truth came shining and it's shining still  
But how much blood upon this earth must spill  
Before we lay our weapons down  
Let us lay our weapons down  
Let mine "oh let my small voice" be a voice for peace  
Oh let mine "oh let my small voice" be a voice for peace  
Oh let mine "oh let my small voice" be a voice for peace  
Let it start here with me, oh let mine be a voice for peace  
And in the face of the beast, oh let mine be a voice  
Until the breaths in me cease, oh let mine be a voice for peace  
Let mine "oh let my small voice" be a voice for peace  
Oh let mine "oh let my small voice" be a voice for peace  
Oh let mine "oh let my small voice" be a voice for peace  
Let it start here with me, oh let mine be a voice for peace  
Raise your voice up, raise your voice up  
Raise your voice up and sing for the promise  

In the eyes of the world your touch is like gold  
Your reputation's so cool and cruel and controlled  
You count your money in your prison tower  
Made of concrete, glass, and steel  
Feeling cozy in the hollow warmth of another business deal  
You've climbed your way to the top but lately it seems  
That there's a hole in the heart of the american dream  
Sittin' pretty in your trophy room with your shining souvenirs  
That just remind you of the wasted time and the lateness of the years  
Is that all, is that all there is  
Is that all, there must be more than this  
In the eyes of the world your touch is like gold  
Your reputation's so cool and cruel and controlled  
In a moment it could all be gone in the twinkling of an eye  
Then what's your pile of precious pride worth then  
If you've never wondered why  
Is that all, is that all there is  
Is that all, there must be more than this  
Is that all, is that all there is  
Is that all, there must be more than this  

Joy at the start  
Fear in the journey  
Joy in the coming home  
A part of the heart  
Gets lost in the learning  
Somewhere along the road  
  
Along the road  
Your path may wander  
A pilgrim's faith may fail  
Absence makes the heart grow stronger  
Darkness obscures the trail  
  
Cursing the quest  
Courting disaster  
Measureless nights forebode  
Moments of rest  
Glimpses of laughter  
Are treasured along the road  
  
Along the road  
Your steps may tumble  
Your thoughts may start to stray  
But through it all a heart held humble  
Levels and lights your way  
  
Joy at the start  
Fear in the journey  
Joy in the coming home  
A part of the heart  
Gets lost in the learning  
Somewhere along the road  
Somewhere along the road  
Somewhere along the road  

There's thorns on the cactus tree  
There's thorns on the rose  
There's thorns in the heart of me  
That nobody knows  
  
They tear at the flesh until  
The tears start to rise  
They form in my heart  
But they fall from Anastasia's eyes.  
  
And I was lost in the wilderness  
Without courage or hope  
I was setting my signal fires  
And watching the smoke  
When out of the smoke appeared  
The sweetest surprise  
And I knew I'd been found  
When first I looked in  
To Anastasia's eyes.  
  
There's thorns on the cactus tree  
There's thorns on the rose  
There's thorns in the heart of me  
That nobody knows  
But finally I've found out where  
My salvation lies  
It lies in the love that lives  
In Anastasia's eyes

Here's another little song for you  
Hope you'll listen to it well  
Means no different than the others do  
It won't change you I can tell  
  
[Chorus:]  
Anyway, I love you  
Everyday I get more sure  
Anyway, I love you  
More and more and more and more and more  
  
I have so much I can offer you  
More to please you with than most  
But trying to tie you down is harder than trying to hold on to a ghost  
  
[Chorus x 2]  
  
So if you ever feel the need for me, darlin'  
Let it carry you along  
Don't be shy and try to hold it down  
'Cause what you feel just can't be wrong  
  
[Chorus x 2]  
  
More and more and more and more  
And more and more and more and more.

I see the raven's made  
Her nest in your eyes  
She's got you thinking that  
Her love is a prize  
And you'll go under from  
The weight of her lies  
As the raven flies  
As the raven flies  
  
She'll bring you stories  
That just never sound true  
She'll bring you secrets  
That were never meant for you,  
And just as you come round  
She'll send you back through  
She's in love with you  
She's in love with you.  
  
Darker, darker  
Don't let her talk her way  
Into you.  
Lonely, lonely  
You know she's only  
No good for you.  
  
I see the raven's made  
Her nest in your eyes  
She's got you thinking that  
Her love is a prize  
And you'll go under from  
The weight of her lies  
  
As the raven flies  
As the raven flies  
As the raven flies  
As the raven flies.

Be on you way  
Don't try to say that  
You love me still.  
If we couldn't find  
The right dream by now  
Then we never will.  
We paid our dues at the door  
And never once saw the stage.  
We wrote our share of love's lore  
And never quite filled the page.  
So be on your way.  
  
Be on your way.  
Maybe someday we will  
Meet again.  
Try not to cry  
Tears make me think  
How it might have been.  
We loved as strong as we could  
But love only got in our way.  
We took our time to be free  
There's nothing much more to say but  
Be on your way.

If I could ever say it right  
And reach your hostage heart despite  
The doubts you harbor then you might  
Come to believe in me  
  
The life I lead is not the kind  
That gives a woman peace of mind  
I only hope someday you'll find  
That you can believe in me  
  
Those other loves that came before  
Mean nothing to me anymore  
But you can never be quite sure  
And will not believe in me  
  
Too many hearts have been broken  
Failing to trust what they feel  
But trust isn't something that's spoken  
And love's never wrong when it's real  
  
If I could only do one thing  
Then I would try to write and sing  
A song that ends your questioning  
And makes you believe in me  
  
And makes you believe in me  
Oh, you can believe in me

Some people tell you  
They're trapped in the distance  
And can't get what  
They want most.  
They throw a wall  
And then call for assistance  
And make no attempt to get close.  
Oh, I think you should know  
You've got to go slow  
Below the surface  
And easy through the waves.  
Slow below the surface  
And easy through the waves.  
You're running so fast  
That you can't find the past  
And your future is wearing thin  
Come from behind  
It's a matter of time  
'Til you see where you've always been  
Oh, I think you should know  
You've got to go slow  
Below the surface  
And easy through the waves  
Slow below the surface  
And easy through the waves.  
Some people tell you they're in trapped in the distance  
And can't get what they want most  
They throw up a wall and then  
Call for assistance  
And make no attempt to get close.  
Oh, I think you should know  
You've got to go slow  
Below the surface  
And easy through the waves  
Slow below the surface  
And easy through the waves.  
You know that your  
Life must have a purpose  
You better make a stand  
While you still can.

I can see you in the distance  
And you're heading for a fall  
Sinking deeper by the minute  
You're about to lose it all  
  
You better change  
Before the sun goes down  
You better leave  
Before you are the last in town.  
You better raise  
Your fortresses or tear them down  
  
Tear them down.  
Tear them down.  
There's an angel on your shoulder  
And a devil at your feet  
And that door you see before you  
Could be poison tasting sweet.  
You better change  
Before the sun goes down  
You better leave  
Before you are the last in town.  
You better raise  
Your fortresses or tear them down  
  
Tear them down.  
Tear them down.  
I can see you in the distance  
And you're heading for a fall  
Sinking deeper by the minute  
You're about to lose it all  
  
You better change  
Before the sun goes down  
You better leave  
Before you are the last in town.  
You better raise  
Your fortresses or tear them down  
  
Tear them down.  
You gotta tear them down.  
Tear them down.  
You better tear them down.  
Tear them down!

Beyond the edge twenty miles a minute  
Shot like a bullet from a frozen gun  
Beyond the edge way beyond the limit  
Beyond the edge on a downhill run  
  
Some play it cool, some take it easy  
Some never know what the snow can do  
Some call me fool, some call my crazy  
I may be crazy but I'm crazy about you  
  
Beyond the edge twenty miles a minute  
Shot like a bullet from a frozen gun  
Beyond the edge way beyond the limit  
Beyond the edge on a downhill run  
  
You got no guts, you get no glory  
There ain't no ruts along the easy ride  
Out on the edge it's another story  
Some got to take it to the other side  
  
Beyond the edge twenty miles a minute  
Shot like a bullet from a frozen gun  
Beyond the edge way beyond the limit  
Beyond the edge on a downhill run  
  
Beyond the edge twenty miles a minute  
Shot like a bullet from a frozen gun  
Beyond the edge way beyond the limit  
Beyond the edge on a downhill run  
  
Beyond the edge twenty miles a minute  
Shot like a bullet from a frozen gun  
Beyond the edge way beyond the limit  
Beyond the edge on a downhill run

In the overcrowded cities  
Where the nights are bright as day  
You spend your weekly paycheck  
And turn your eyes away  
From the crisis we've created  
With our self-indulgent ways  
Living like there's no tomorrow  
Well that just might be the case.  
  
Now they're tearing down the forests  
In the jungles of Brazil  
Without a second thought about  
The species that they kill  
But extinction is forever  
And still the forests fall  
And push it ever closer to  
Extinction for us all.  
  
But you're so blind to the truth  
Blind to the truth  
And you can't see nothin'  
You're so blind to the truth  
Blind to the truth  
But the judgment day is coming.  
  
Now the politicians bicker  
On the early evening news  
Pledging their allegiance  
To whoever they can use  
And the corporate bosses snicker  
As they watch the profits soar  
They don't care what they make next month  
Just as long as it is more.  
  
The take our farms and marshlands  
Drive nature to the wall  
Just so they can build another  
Goddamn shopping mall  
And it doesn't seem to matter  
If we cannot see the stars  
Just as long as they can keep  
On building obsolescent cars  
'Cause they're so  
  
But you're so blind to the truth  
Blind to the truth  
And you can't see nothin'  
You're so blind to the truth  
Blind to the truth  
But the judgment day is coming.  
  
Now you cannot drink the water  
And you cannot breathe the air  
The sky is ripping open and you  
Still don't seem to care  
The soil is tired and toxic  
And unable to provide  
The clock is running out and  
There is nowhere left to hid.  
  
Now there's laws that we must live by  
And they're not the laws of man  
Can't you see the shadow  
That moves across this land  
The future is upon us  
And there's so much we must do  
And you know I can't ignore it  
And, my friend, neither can you  
Unless you're  
  
But you're so blind to the truth  
Blind to the truth  
And you can't see nothin'  
You're so blind to the truth  
Blind to the truth  
But the judgment day is coming.

Up through the branches  
The stars shine above  
On the arroyos  
And mesas you loved  
And as the moon rises  
The black mountain mourns  
For the old friend  
He'll look on no more  
Jacks-In-The-Pulpit  
  
Bones in the sky  
Long winding rivers  
That never ran dry  
And the secrets she gathered  
From the wild blowing sands  
Breathed in her heart  
And her hands  
  
I sing to your spirit  
Where all my dreams dwell  
The vision, the freedom  
The life lived so well  
And I sing in your canyons  
And the echoes ring clear  
And I wish somehow  
You may still hear

Found your heart  
And lost your lover  
Lick your wounds  
And run for cover.  
  
Take your time  
There'll be another  
And don't make the same mistake twice  
Unless you can pay the price.  
  
All the years  
You spent in growing  
End up one more  
Line you're towing  
Don't look now  
Your age is showing  
And it's much too late  
To turn back  
You better pull in the slack  
  
Captured Angel  
Aching to make your break  
Your freedom's at stake  
You better fly now  
Fly now, fly now  
While your wings are still young  
Your cage door's been flung  
Wide Open  
And I'm hoping you see  
That there's a place beside me  
If you ever need it.  
  
Sold your dreams  
For sweet salvation  
Left with righteous indignation  
Now it seems that you face starvation  
And nourishment doesn't come cheap  
You better go back to sleep  
  
Captured Angel  
Aching to make your break  
Your freedom's at stake  
You better fly now  
Fly now, fly now  
While your wings are still young  
Your cage door's been flung  
Wide open  
And I'm hoping you see  
That there's a place beside me  
If you ever need it.

The woman's like the night  
She comes and goes  
She breaks my heart each day  
And never knows,  
And the time I spend in sorrow  
Will match the time I live  
And the time that's left is  
All I have to give.  
  
The woman's like an ivy on a pole  
She wraps her twisted love around my soul  
There will come a sudden winter  
When she'll seek the warmth of day  
And there'll come a time when she will come to stay.  
  
The woman's like the tide  
She comes and goes  
She knows the things that I can just suppose.  
And the time I spend in sorrow  
Will match the time that she laughs  
And the songs I sing cannot explain but half.

Somewhere on a lonely muddy country road  
I heard your song, crow, for the first time  
Somewhere in the distance wicked, black and low  
  
Made me feel as I was running from a crime  
Made me feel as I was running from a crime  
Some say she died of drowning in the river deep  
Some say she died of a sudden start  
  
Some say they found her swinging from my old man's tree  
And some folks say she died of a broken heart  
And some folks say she died of a broken heart  
I can't believe they would pay men just to hunt me down  
  
But silver coins to each one do they give  
And by now there's a gallows standing in the town  
And I wonder how much more I have to live  
And I wonder how much more I have to live  
  
Somewhere on a lonely muddy country road  
I heard your song, crow, for the last time  
Somewhere in the distance wicked, black and low  
  
Made me feel as I was running from a crime  
Made me feel as I was running from a crime  
Made me feel as I was running from a crime

And we are but an island  
  
In an ocean  
This is our home  
Third from the sun  
Let it be evergreen  
Let it be evergreen  
And we are but an island  
  
In an ocean  
This is our home  
Third from the sun  
God, keep it evergreen  
To keep it ever green  
I would lay my life down  
And we are but an island  
  
In an ocean  
This is our home  
Third from the sun  
Let it be evergreen  
Let it be evergreen

Waiting in the wings your courage sings  
Before you falter  
It's just another way to say  
What's there but never shows  
  
It's just another day to lay  
Your sins before the altar  
And where it's going to end  
This time around nobody knows  
  
Every time it seems  
That you have gained an understanding  
Those devils at your heels  
Reach up and try to tip the scales  
  
Waking from a dream  
You see it's all been  
Done without you  
And every vain attempt to make it stay  
Is destined to fail  
  
Fury rages through your restless days  
Shades of time that's gone before  
Empty cages where the prisoner plays  
'Til the door swings closed behind for evermore  
  
Evermore  
Evermore  
  
Long before we come of age  
We yearn to leave the garden  
And wrestle with a myth  
The hand of fate has faintly drawn  
  
But somewhere on the way  
We feel our hearts begin to harden  
And see just as we learn to turn around  
The garden is gone  
  
Fury rages through your restless days  
Shades of time that's gone before  
Empty cages where the prisoner plays  
'Til the door swings closed behind for evermore  
  
Evermore  
Evermore  

May the trail rise up to meet you  
May your heart rejoice in song  
May the skies be fair above you  
As you journey ever on  
  
Ever on--ever on  
Ever on--ever on  
  
And in this planetary circle  
We are but a single stone  
Spinning on our fragile axis  
Through the endless night along  
  
Ever on--ever on  
  
May your love be there to guide us  
May it always keep us strong  
May we walk within your footsteps  
As you lead us ever on  
  
Ever on--ever on  

Exiles running from each other  
We are exiles, living undercover  
Looking for another day to make it all work out  
Exiles standing in the shadows  
We are exiles, weary of the battles  
Looking for another day to make it all work out  
  
You sit there and I sit here  
Looking at you used to be like looking in a mirror  
But now it's dark, no light reflects  
It never ends like one expects  
  
I don't know where we went wrong  
If I knew that I'd never had to write this song  
But here we stand so far apart  
Separate pieces of a broken heart  
  
We live like exiles running from each other  
We are exiles, living undercover  
Looking for another day to make it all work out  
Exiles standing in the shadows  
We are exiles, weary of the battles  
Looking for another day to make it all work out  
  
You said you need time to think  
But I just couldn't go on living on the brink  
So now we take this frozen stance  
In hopes that we'll find one more chance  
  
Different wants and different needs  
Moving through our changes at such different speeds  
I don't know why and I don't know when  
But somewhere we'll find love again  
  
Exiles running from each other  
We are exiles, living undercover  
Looking for another day to make it all work out  
  
Exiles running from each other  
We are exiles, living undercover  
Looking for another day to make it all work out  
Exiles standing in the shadows  
We are exiles looking for another day to make it all work out

I hear the thunder three miles away  
The Island's leaking into the bay  
The poison is spreading  
The demon is free  
And people are running from what they can't even see  
  
Face the fire  
You can't turn away  
The risk grows greater with each passing day  
The waiting's over  
The moment has come  
To kill the fire and turn to the sun  
  
They'll take your money  
And then take your health  
To line their pockets with unequalled wealth  
Those men are under the power of gold  
We won't be safe until we shut them down  
  
Face the fire  
You can't turn away  
The risk grows greater with each passing day  
The waiting's over  
The moment has come  
To kill the fire and turn to the sun  
  
The people came to the capitol town  
One hundred thousand of them laid their hearts down  
They screamed in anger and broadcast their fears  
Just to have them fall on deaf ears  
  
Face the fire  
You can't turn away  
The risk grows greater with each passing day  
The waiting's over  
The moment has come  
To kill the fire and turn to the sun  
  
Kill the fire and turn to the sun

There was a time, a simpler time  
When a man could be sure of where he stood  
I used to work at the yard, working honest and hard  
The hours were long but the pay was oh so good  
I had a family and friends, oh so many friends  
We'd drive to the lake on holidays  
Back then it wasn't so dear for a sandwich or beer  
At night I still dream I can see their faces  
Certain things that you depend upon  
There are places that you know  
And the faces of america  
Oh, where do they go, where did they go  
I was born on a farm, a mid-western farm  
I rode on the tractor with my dad  
And though we never had much it was always enough  
And we made the best with what we had  
But then came four years of drought and the bottom dropped out  
My father was broken like the rest  
And I can still see his hands signing over his lands  
And the bankers grow fat on the flesh of the dispossessed  
Certain things that you depend upon  
There are places I can go I sift the ashes of america  
For someplace I used to know  
Someplace I used to know  
Someplace I used to know  
There was a time, a simpler time  
When a man could be sure of where he stood  
I used to work at the yard, working honest and hard  
The hours were long but the pay was oh so good  
Certain things that you depend upon I used to think were guaranteed  
Like the right of every man to work and feed his family  
And the faces of america seem so distant and estranged  
Have their eyes become too blind to see  
How much their hearts have changed  
How much their hearts have changed  
How much their hearts have changed  

Sometimes in the night I feel it  
Near as my next breath and yet untouchable  
Silently the past comes stealing  
Like the taste of some forbidden sweet  
Along the walls in shadowed rafters  
Moving like a thought through haunted atmospheres  
Muted cries and echoed laughter  
Banished dreams that never sank in sleep  
Lost in love and found in reason  
Questions that the mind can find no answers for  
Ghostly eyes conspire treason  
As they gather just outside the door  
And every ghost that calls upon us  
Brings another measure in the mystery  
Death is there to keep us honest  
And constantly remind us we are free  
Down the ancient corridors  
And through the gates of time  
Run the ghosts of days that we've left behind  
Down the ancient corridors  
And through the gates of time  
Run the ghosts of dreams that we left behind  
Sometimes in the night I feel it  
Near as my next breath and yet untouchable  
Silently the past comes stealing  
Like the taste of some forbidden sweet  
And every ghost that calls upon us  
Brings another measure in the mystery  
Death is there to keep us honest  
And constantly remind us we are free  
Down the ancient corridors  
And through the gates of time  
Run the ghosts of days that we've left behind  
Down the ancient corridors  
And through the gates of time  
Run the ghosts of dreams that we left behind  

Slow down girl, what's the hurry  
Love can wait if you're worried  
Then I'll try to ease your mind  
You say we're losing time  
  
But I've got to find  
A way to convince you  
I've got cause to be wary  
For so long I've had to carry  
  
The weight of another soul  
You say I won't let go  
But how do you know I can  
Give me some time now  
I've just got to find how  
I'm going to forget her  
And talk myself into believing  
  
That she and I are through  
Then maybe I'll fall for you  
You're just what I've needed  
But I'd be unfair and conceited  
  
To say you're the only one  
Woman, I'm on the run  
From something I have begun  
And can't seem to finish  
Although it hasn't been recent  
I still think it wouldn't be decent  
  
To let you believe in me so soon  
I've got to make you see  
What she meant to me  
So please  
  
Give me some time now  
I've just got to find how  
I'm going to forget her  
And talk myself into believing  
That she and I are through  
Then maybe I'll fall for you  
  
Maybe I'll fall for you  
Maybe I'll fall for you  
Maybe I'll fall for you  
Maybe I'll fall for you

I still recall the place  
When I first felt your gypsy wind  
Playing on my face  
That summer's long since gone  
But gypsy winds have ways of staying on.  
  
Voices from our past  
Still insist on arguing  
That love will never last  
And though our hearts may turn  
It's only when you listen  
that you learn.  
  
And I wonder at the ways  
The strands of love meander  
Through our close and distant days  
The blood of passion plays  
  
Burns our thirsty souls  
And chases reason far away...  
Far away...  
And still your gypsy wind  
Will soothe my soul and call me  
back again.  
  
Growing wise with age  
We come to see the printing  
Through the pictures on the page  
Though something's always lost  
The gain is always tempered by the cost.  
  
And I wonder at the ways  
The strands of love meander  
Through our close and distant days  
The blood of passion plays  
  
Burns our thirsty souls  
And chases reason far away...  
Far away...  
And still your gypsy wind  
Will soothe my soul and call me back again.

Lucky at love  
Well, maybe so  
There's still a lot of things  
You'll never know  
Like why each time  
The sky begins to snow  
You cry  
  
You're faithful to her  
In your careless way  
So you miss her when  
She's far away  
But every time you think  
You've got it straight  
You fall  
  
You face the future  
With a weary past  
Those dreams you banked upon  
Are fading fast  
You know you love her  
But it may not last  
Your fear  
  
It's never easy  
And it's never clear  
Who's to navigate  
And who's to steer  
So you flounder  
Drifting ever near the rocks  
  
It's hard to say  
Where love went wrong  
It's hard to say just when  
It's hard to walk away from love  
It may never come again  
  
You do your best  
To keep your hand in play  
And try to keep  
Those lonesome blues at bay  
You think you're winning  
But it's hard to say sometimes  
  
It's hard to say  
Where love went wrong  
It's hard to say just when  
It's hard to walk away from love  
It may never come again  
  
Lucky at love  
Well, maybe so  
There's still a lot of things  
You'll never know  
Like why each time  
The sky begins to snow  
You cry  

Well there's too many windows in this old hotel  
And rooms filled with reckless pride  
And the walls have grown sturdy  
And the halls have worn well  
But there is nobody living in inside  
Nobody living inside  
Gonna pull in the shutters on this heart of mine  
Roll up the carpets and pull in the blinds  
And retreat to the chambers that I left behind  
In hopes there still may be love left to find  
Still may be love left to find  
Seek inspiration in daily affairs  
Now your soul is in trouble and requires repairs  
And the voices you hear at the top of the stairs  
Are only echoes of unanswered prayers  
Echoes of unanswered prayers  
Well there's too many windows in this old hotel  
And rooms filled with reckless pride  
And the walls have grown sturdy  
And the halls have worn well  
But there is nobody living in inside  
Nobody living inside  

Handing me a looking glass  
You asked me who it was I saw  
But if I was to answer you  
You know I'd surely answer wrong  
  
'Cause I've loved you too long  
I've loved you too long  
  
Turning halfway toward the sun  
You asked me to become your shade  
But why should I be made to run  
At the end of the parade?  
  
Love is not that way at all  
Love is not that way  
  
Looking back now toward the start  
You said you thought I'd lost my path  
And I asked if you still considered love an art  
And you said, "No, I think it's more a craft"  
  
And I just turned and laughed  
I just had to turn and laugh

Hickory Grove, wait for me  
I'm just as poor as a man can be.  
Hickory Grove, wait for me  
I'm just as blind as the other men  
That see.  
  
Hickory Grove, make the sun  
Rise slower I don't have much time.  
Hickory Grove, watch me run  
Down through the years of my prime.  
  
Lady Luck, play your hand  
I've got a life for you to play with  
Hickory Grove, you will stand...  
I've got a dream that I can stay with.

There's a place in the Rockies  
A place that I know  
Where the world cannot find me  
And the time goes so slow.  
In the piney wood forest  
There's a flower that grows  
Through the long months of winter  
And the high country snows.  
  
To a house by a meadow  
'Neath the towering peaks  
Is a place where my heart goes  
When it's love that it seeks.  
There a woman lies waiting  
Like the wild growing rose  
Through the long months of winter  
And the high country snows.  
  
In the space of a lifetime  
A man misses much  
Till he finds him a woman  
And treasures her touch.  
When the lakes all are frozen  
And the wild wind blows  
I'll return to my darlin'  
And the high country snows.  
I'll return to my darlin'  
And the high country snows.

Rain keeps falling, keeps falling down  
Like it's never going to quit  
Trouble stalks this one horse town  
Like it can smell the fear inside of it  
Through the night the fires rage  
Mixing juices 'til they disengage  
Mouths get hungry and the hands reach out  
Is there something we should talk about  
We've got to head for higher ground  
Good people there's hard choices going down now  
We've got to head for higher ground  
Head for higher ground, higher ground  
Shattered trusts and broken vows  
Can exact a heavy toll  
And in the race of heart and mind  
Sure, the loser is the soul  
We've got to head for higher ground  
Good people there's hard choices going down now  
We've got to head for higher ground  
Head for higher ground, higher ground  
Higher, higher, higher, higher  
Higher, higher, higher  
Faithless deeds for faithless times  
All men are guilty of their brothers' crimes  
So few are chosen, there's even fewer called  
So few can ever read the writing on the wall  
We've got to head for higher ground  
Oh people there's hard choices going down now  
We've got to head for higher ground  
Head for higher ground, higher  
We've got to head for higher ground  
Good people there's hard choices going down now  
We've got to head for higher ground  
Head for higher ground, higher ground  

Dusty day dawning  
Three hours late  
Open the curtains  
And let the rest wait.  
My mind goes running  
Three thousand miles east  
I may miss the harvest  
But I won't miss the feast.  
  
And it looks like you're gonna  
Have to see me again  
And it looks like you're gonna  
Have to see me again  
And it looks like you're gonna  
Have to see me again.  
Illinois, oh, Illinois.  
  
South California  
Your sun is too cold  
It looks like your hills  
Have been raped of their gold.  
I should have come out  
When I was first told  
This lamb has got to  
Return to the fold.  
  
And it looks like you're gonna  
Have to see me again  
And it looks like you're gonna  
Have to see me again  
And it looks like you're gonna  
Have to see me again.  
Illinois, oh, Illinois.  
Illinois, I'm your boy.  
  
Flat on the prairies  
Soil and stone  
Stretching forever  
Taking me home  
'Cause I've got a woman  
Who waits for me there  
And I need a breath of that  
Sweet country air.  
  
And it looks like you're gonna  
Have to see me again  
And it looks like you're gonna  
Have to see me again  
And it looks like you're gonna  
Have to see me again.  
Illinois, oh, Illinois.  
Illinois, I'm your boy.

There's a ring around the moon tonight and a chill in the air  
And a fire in the stars that hang so near, so near  
There's a sound in the wind that blows through the wild mountain holds  
Like the sighs of a thousand crying souls, crying souls  
There's a time when the traveler is fated to find  
That insight has turned his gaze behind, behind  
And the steps taken yesterday will beckon again  
And lead to his weary journey's end, his journey's end  
And in the passage from the cradle to the grave we are born, madly dancing  
Rushing headlong through the crashing of the days  
We run on and on without a backwards glance  
We run on and on without a backwards glance  
I cast my fate with the wife of Lot I turned my gaze around  
Knowing neither what I sought nor what was to be found  
Heeding weakness, feeding strength, oh life at length is frail  
I seek again the river's source through time's dark shadowed veil  
In the fast fading century, as we spin through the years  
I pray that our failing vision clears, our vision clears  
And in the passage from the cradle to the grave we are born, madly dancing  
Rushing headlong through the crashing of the days  
We run on and on without a backwards glance  
We run on and on without a backwards glance  
The places dash and the faces dart like fishes in a dream  
Hiding 'neath the murky banks of long forgotten streams  
The lines of life are never long when seen from end to end  
The future's never coming, and the past has never been  
There's a ring around the moon tonight, and a chill in the air  
And a fire in the stars that hang so near, so near  

Is it the voice of the whispering sea?  
Or is it the way we're dancing?  
Is it the way that the moon  
Hits your eyes?  
Or is this magic?  
Or is this magic?  
Is it the way that you sway  
In my arms?  
Or is it the soft winds blowing?  
Is it the music that carries us off?  
Or is this magic?  
Or is this magic?  
Close your eyes and drink in  
The sweet sad guitar  
Close your eyes and drift to  
The beat of the moon and the stars  
Is it the rush of the surf  
That I hear?  
Or only our mad hearts beating?  
Will this be only a fleeting affair?  
Or is this magic?  
Or is this magic?  
Close your eyes and drink in  
The sweet sad guitar  
Close your eyes and drift to  
The beat of the moon and the stars  
Is it the voice of the whispering sea?  
Or is it the way we're dancing?  
Will this be only a fleeting affair?  
Or is this magic?...

Climbing a mountain  
In darkness  
Stranded alone on the ledge.  
Every attempt that I make to hold on  
Pushes me nearer the edge.  
  
Sensing the changes impending  
My thoughts are diffused by despair  
I feel like I'm swimming straight up  
Underwater  
Desperately racing for air  
I'm racing for air.  
  
And the chords struck at birth  
Grow more distant  
Yet, we strike them again and again.  
And we plead and we pray  
For a glimmer of day  
As the night folds its wings  
And descends  
Exposing the loose ends.  
  
Surrounding myself with possessions  
I surely have more than I need  
I don't know if this is justice, hard earned,  
Or simply a matter of greed  
A matter of greed.  
  
And the chords struck at birth  
Grow more distant  
Yet, we strike them again and again.  
And we plead and we pray  
For a glimmer of day  
As the night folds its wings  
And descends  
  
Exposing the loose ends.  
And the chords struck at birth  
Grow more distant  
Yet, we strike them again and again.  
And we plead and we pray  
For a glimmer of day  
As the night folds its wings  
And descends  
  
Exposing the loose ends.

Try your best to see through the confusion  
Seems the more you see  
The less you try  
You don't know what's real and what's illusion  
If you don't know by now then how should I?  
(I've been thinking 'bout the)  
  
Love gone by  
Honey, has the well run dry?  
It's enough to make you cry  
Thinking 'bout the love gone by.  
  
Give me back my heart  
And call it even  
Ain't no use in figuring who's to blame  
Once I thought this love was made in heaven  
Now I think it's just a crying shame.  
(And I've been thinking 'bout the)  
  
Love gone by  
Honey, has the well run dry?  
It's enough to make you cry  
Thinking 'bout the love gone by.  
  
Winners never know the worth of losing  
'Til the prize has slipped right through their hands  
Love will take a heart of its own choosing  
And break it if you try to understand.  
(We're left with nothing but the)  
  
Love gone by  
Honey, has the well run dry?  
It's enough to make you cry  
Thinking 'bout the love gone by.

The hours grow shorter as the days go by  
You never get to stop and open your eyes  
One day you're waiting for the sky to fall  
The next you're dazzled by the beauty of it all  
When you're lovers in a dangerous time  
Lovers in a dangerous time  
These fragile bodies of touch and taste  
This vibrant skin, this hair like lace  
Spirits open to the thrust of grace  
Never a breath you can afford to waste  
When you're lovers in a dangerous time  
Lovers in a dangerous time  
Lovers in a dangerous time  
Lovers in a dangerous time  
When you're lovers in a dangerous time  
Sometimes you're made to feel as if your love's a crime  
But nothing worth having comes without some kind of fight  
You got to kick at the darkness 'til it bleeds daylight  
When you're lovers in a dangerous time  
Lovers in a dangerous time  
Lovers in a dangerous time  
Lovers in a dangerous time  

Now that we love  
Now that the lonely nights are over  
How do we make love stay?  
Now that we know  
The fire can burn bright or merely smolder  
How do we keep it from dying away?  
  
Elusive as dreams  
Barely remembered in the morning  
Love like a phantom flies  
But held in the heart  
It pales like the emply smile adorning  
A statue with sightless eyes  
  
Moments fleet, taste sweet within the rapture  
When precious flesh is greedily consumed  
But mystery's a thing not easily captured  
And once deceased not easily exhumed  
  
Now that we love  
Now that the lonely nights are over  
How do we make love stay?  
  
Now that we loved  
Look at the moonless night and tell me  
How do we make love stay?  

Hard days I'm traveling alone for too long  
Ooh Ooh, I'm missing you  
I'm always somewhere that I never belong  
Ooh Ooh, I'm missing you  
  
I'm moving so fast now it doesn't seem true  
Ooh Ooh, I'm missing you  
I'm getting closer but I don't know what to  
Ooh Ooh, I'm missing you  
  
Oh, if I had you beside me  
Then I just might sleep through the night  
Your love is the promise that guides me  
All of the days of my life  
  
This life I'm living's getting so hard to feel  
Ooh Ooh, I'm missing you  
The days are empty and the nights are unreal  
Ooh Ooh, I'm missing you  
  
Oh, if I had you beside me  
Then I just might sleep through the night  
Your love is the promise that guides me  
All of the days of my life  
All of the days of my life  
  
Hard days I'm traveling alone for too long  
Ooh Ooh, I'm missing you  
I'm always somewhere that I never belong  
Ooh Ooh, I'm missing you  
Oh, if I had you beside me  
Then I just might sleep through the night  
Your love is the promise that guides me  
All of the days of my life  
All of the days of my life  
All of the days of my life  

You and I were lovers all along  
We had a good thing going strong  
And never doubted.  
Lately, I feel changes comin' on  
I know that I will soon be gone  
And you don't even want  
To talk about it.  
  
Oh, and it makes me stop and  
Wonder why  
People give their hearts and turn  
around and say goodbye  
If there's something on your mind  
You better say it while there's time  
'Cause I'm leavin' when I see that  
Morning sky.  
  
Oh, how did we ever come to this?  
There's nothing for me in your kisses anymore.  
Late nights in the kitchen  
I'm pretending I still care  
But we both know there's nothing there  
And you just keep on starin'  
At the door.  
  
Oh, and it makes me stop and  
Wonder why  
People give their hearts and turn  
around and say goodbye  
If there's something on your mind  
You better say it while there's time  
'Cause I'm leavin' when I see that  
Morning sky.

See that morning sky.

Well, I'm runnin' down this mountain pass at midnight  
Those truckers they all flash their lights at me  
This highway ain't the very best companion  
?Cause I know there's somewhere else I'd rather be  
  
The moonlight on the snow just sets me thinking  
?Bout the way your smile shines upon your face  
And I know this ain't the last beer I'll be drinking  
Before I reach my final resting place  
  
Oh, I wish that I was in your arms a sleeping  
Dreaming of the sweet love we just made  
But I'm runnin' down this mountain pass at midnight  
Wishin' I was in your arms again  
  
Oh my wheels are running hard against this mountain  
I finally crossed the Archuleta line  
Another hour and I'll be with my darlin'  
To dry those lonesome tears that she's been cryin'  
  
Oh, I wish that I was in your arms a sleeping  
Dreaming of the sweet love we just made  
But I'm runnin' down this mountain pass at midnight  
Wishin' I was in your arms again  
  
I'm runnin' down this mountain pass at midnight  
Those truckers they all flash their lights at me  
Well this highway ain't the very best companion  
?Cause I know there's somewhere else I'd rather be  
Oh, I wish that I was in your arms a sleeping  
Dreaming of the sweet love we just made  
But I'm runnin' down this mountain pass at midnight  
Wishin' I was in your arms again  
I am runnin' down this mountain pass at midnight  
Wishin' I was in your arms again  

High on this mountain  
The clouds down below  
I'm feeling so strong and alive  
From this rocky perch  
I'll continue to search  
For the wind  
And the snow  
And the sky  
  
I want a lover  
I want some friends  
And I want to live in the sun  
And I want to do all the things that I  
Never have done.  
  
Sunny bright mornings  
And pale moonlit nights  
Keep me from feeling alone  
Now, I'm learning to fly  
And this freedom is like  
Nothing that I've ever known  
I've seen the bottom  
And I've been on top  
But mostly I've lived in between  
And where do you go  
When you get to the end of  
Your dream?  
  
Off in the nether lands  
I heard a sound  
Like the beating of heavenly wings  
And deep in my brain  
I can hear a refrain  
Of my soul as she rises and sings  
Anthems to glory and  
Anthems to love and  
Hymns filled with early delight  
Like the songs that the darkness  
Composes to worship the light.  
  
Once in a vision  
I came on some woods  
And stood at a fork in the road  
My choices were clear  
Yet I froze with the fear  
Of not knowing which way to go.  
  
One road was simple  
Acceptance of life  
The other road offered sweet peace  
When I made my decision  
My vision became my release.

One too many days  
I've felt forgotten  
And one too many nights  
I've slept alone.  
  
And every time I watch  
The fruit turn rotten  
I tell myself I'll  
Try a little harder  
Next time.  
  
Sacred are the ties  
That love entrusts us  
Even if they fray  
Before they bind  
And I'm afraid I never  
Did you justice  
So I'm going to feel my  
Love a little stronger  
Make it last a little longer  
Next time.  
  
Next time  
I ain't gonna fall on my knees  
And come out of love empty handed.  
But next time I'll be  
Even harder to please  
When will the next time be?  
  
One too many days  
I've felt forgotten  
And one too many nights  
I've slept alone.  
And every time I watch  
The fruit turn rotten  
I tell myself I'll  
Try a little harder  
Play my cards a little smarter  
Next time.  
Whoa oh  
Next time

Across the vein of night  
There cuts a path of searing light  
Burning like a beacon  
On the edges of our sight  
At the point of total darkness  
And the lights divine divide  
A soul can let its shadow stretch  
And land on either side --  
Either side  
  
And balanced on the precipice  
The moment must reveal  
Naked in the face of time  
Our race within the wheel  
As we hang beneath the heavens  
And we hover over hell  
Our hearts become the instruments  
We learn to play so well  
  
Wealthy the spirit  
That knows its own flight  
Stealthy the hunter  
Who slays his own fright  
Blessed the traveler  
Who journeys the length of the light  
  
Outside the pull of gravity  
Beyond the spectral veil  
Within our careful reasoning  
We search to no avail  
For the constant in the chaos  
For the fulcrum in the void  
Following a destiny  
Our steps cannot avoid  
  
Across the vein of night  
There cuts a path of searing light  
Burning like a beacon  
On the edges of our sight  
At the point of total darkness  
And the lights divine divide  
A soul can let its shadow  
Stretch and land on either side  
  
Wealthy the spirit  
That knows its own flight  
Stealthy the hunter  
Who slays his own fright  
Blessed the traveler  
Who journeys the length of the light  
  
In a spiral never-ending  
Are we drawn towards the source  
Spinning at the mercy  
Of an unrelenting force  
So we stare into the emptiness  
And fall beneath the weight  
Circling the Nexus in a  
Fevered dance with fate --  
  
Wealthy the spirit  
That knows its own flight  
Stealthy the hunter  
Who slays his own fright  
Blessed the traveler  
Who journeys the length of the light  

End of October  
The sleepy brown woods seem to  
Nod down their heads to the Winter.  
Yellows and grays  
Paint the sad skies today  
And I wonder when  
You're coming home.  
  
Woke up one morning  
The wind through the window  
Reminded me Winter  
Was just 'round the bend.  
Somehow I just didn't  
See it was coming  
  
It took me by surprise again.  
And I hear you're in San Francisco  
Living with your sister who's a mother to be.  
And her husband's way down in Georgia  
And I'm still in old Tennessee  
  
Wishing you'd come home to me.  
Life here is easy  
I'm sure you recall  
How it's so warm and breezy  
In the Summer and the Fall.  
  
But Winter's upon me  
And I've got no heat here  
And I miss your fire so sweet, Dear  
I miss your fire so sweet.  
And I hear you're in San Francisco  
Living with your sister who's a mother to be.  
  
And her husband's way down in Georgia  
And I'm still in old Tennessee  
Wishing you'd come home to me.  
End of October  
The sleepy brown woods seem to  
Nod down their heads to the Winter.  
  
Yellows and gray  
Paint the sad skies today  
And I wonder when  
You're coming home  
I wonder when you're coming home.

Once I loved you and you loved me  
We believed our souls were meant to breathe as one  
And could never come undone again  
  
And once I believed that you and I  
Were the two that would defy the fickle gods  
And win out against the odds and go on forevermore  
  
But now that your heart has turned away  
I must try to find a way to let you go  
Even though I know you will never leave me  
  
Cause you were my life's one great romance  
And I will always see you dancing through my dreams  
And as hopeless as it seems, I will always love you  
  
And now if you think we've said it all  
Let the final curtain fall on us at last  
And just put it in the past and say our last farewell  

I have these moments  
All steady and strong  
I'm feeling so holy and humble  
The next thing I know  
I'm all worried and weak  
And I feel myself starting to crumble  
  
The meanings get lost  
And the teachings get tossed  
And you don't know what  
You're going to do next  
You wait for the sun  
But it never quite comes  
Some kind of message  
Comes through to you  
Some kind of message comes through  
  
And it says to you. . .  
  
Love when you can  
Cry when you have to  
Be who you must  
That's a part of the plan  
Await your arrival  
With simple survival  
And one day we'll all understand  
  
I had a woman  
Who gave me her soul  
But I wasn't ready to take it  
Her heart was so fragile  
And heavy to hold  
And I was afraid I might break it  
  
Your conscience awakes  
And you see your mistakes  
And you wish someone  
Would buy your confessions  
The days miss their mark  
And the night gets so dark  
And some kind of message  
Comes through to you  
Some kind of message shoots through --  
  
Love when you can  
Cry when you have to  
Be who you must  
That's a part of the plan  
Await your arrival  
With simple survival  
And one day we'll all understand  
  
There is no Eden or  
Heavenly gates  
That you're gonna make it to one day  
But all of the answers you seek  
Can be found  
In the dreams that you dream on the way  

Promises made  
Promises broken  
Measures of our demise  
Secrets of souls that  
Rarely get spoken  
Pleasure's a thin disguise.  
  
Dozens of ways  
Dozens of reasons  
Shielding our hearts from pain  
Riddles of romance  
That distance may yet explain.  
  
Certain of nothing  
So fearful of love  
Nobody seems to show you enough  
Over and over  
The scenes are replayed  
And once again  
Those promises made.  
  
Feeling forsaken  
Broken in two  
How did this ever happen to you?  
Taken for granted  
Bruised and betrayed  
Lonely survivors  
These promises made.  
  
Dozens of ways  
Dozens of reasons  
Shielding our hearts from pain  
Riddles of romance  
That distance may yet explain.  
  
Certain of nothing  
You're so damn fearful of love  
Nobody seems to show you enough  
Over and over  
The scenes are replayed  
And once again  
Those promises made.

[Chorus:]  
Listen to the rhythm of the falling rain  
Telling me just what a fool I've been  
I wish that it would go and let me cry in vain  
And let me be alone again  
  
Now the only girl I've ever loved has gone away  
Looking for a brand new start  
Little does she know that when she left that day  
Along with her she took my heart  
  
[Bridge]  
Rain please tell me now does that seem fair  
For her to steal my heart away when she don't care  
I can't love another when my heart's somewhere far away  
  
[Chorus]  
Listen to the rhythm of the falling rain  
Telling me just what a fool I've been  
I wish that it would go and let me cry in vain  
And let me be alone again  
  
[Bridge]  
Oh the only girl I've ever loved has gone away  
Looking for a brand new start  
Little does she know that when she left that day  
Along with her she took my heart  
  
Rain won't you tell her that I love her so  
Please ask the sun to set her heart aglow  
And rain in her heart and let the love we knew start to grow  
  
[Chorus]  
Listen to the rhythm of the falling rain  
Telling me just what a fool I've been  
Oh I wish that it would go and let me cry in vain  
And let me be alone again  
  
When the rain comes  
They run and hide their heads  
They might as well be dead  
When the rain comes

Born in the valley  
And raised in the trees  
Of western Kentucky  
On wobbly knees  
With mama beside you  
To help you along  
You'll soon be growing up strong  
  
All the long, lazy mornings  
In pastures of green  
The sun on your withers  
The wind in your mane  
Could never prepare you  
For what lies ahead  
The run for the roses so red  
  
And it's run for the roses  
As fast as you can  
You fate is delivered  
Your moment's at hand  
It's the chance of a lifetime  
In a lifetime of chance  
And it's high time you joined  
In the dance  
It's high time you joined  
In the dance  
  
From sire to sire  
It's born in the blood  
The fire of a mare  
And the strength of a stud  
It's breeding and it's training  
And it's something unknown  
That drives you  
And carries you home  
  
And it's run for the roses  
As fast as you can  
Your fate is delivered  
Your moment's at hand  
It's the chance of a lifetime  
In a lifetime of chance  
And it's high time you joined  
In the dance  

Met my old lover in the grocery store  
The snow was falling Christmas Eve  
I stood behind her in the frozen foods  
And I touched her on the sleeve  
  
She didn't recognize the face at first  
But then her eyes flew open wide  
She went to hug me and she spilled her purse  
And we laughed until we cried  
  
We took her groceries to the check out stand  
The food was totaled up and bagged  
We stood there lost in our embarrassment  
As the conversation lagged  
  
We went to have ourselves a drink or two  
But couldn't find an open bar  
We bought a six-pack at the liquor store  
And we drank it in her car  
  
We drank a toast to innocence  
We drank a toast to now  
We tried to reach beyond the emptiness  
But neither one knew how  
  
She said she's married her an architect  
Who kept her warm and safe and dry  
She would have liked to say she loved the man  
But she didn't like to lie  
  
I said the years had been a friend to her  
And that her eyes were still as blue  
But in those eyes I wasn't sure if I saw  
Doubt or gratitude  
  
She said she saw me in the record stores  
And that I must be doing well  
I said the audience was heavenly  
But the traveling was Hell  
  
We drank a toast to innocence  
We drank a toast to now  
We tried to reach beyond the emptiness  
But neither one knew how  
  
We drank a toast to innocence  
We drank a toast to time  
Reliving, in our eloquence  
Another "Auld Lang Syne"  
  
The beer was empty and our tongues were tired  
And running out of things to say  
She gave a kiss to me as I got out  
And I watched her drive away  
  
Just for a moment I was back at school  
And felt that old familiar pain  
And, as I turned to make my way back home  
The snow turned into rain

Seldom seen  
A scarecrow's dream  
I hang in the hopes of replacement  
Castles tall  
I built them all  
But I dream that I'm trapped in  
The basement.  
  
And if you ever hear me calling out  
And if you've been by paupers crowned  
Between the worlds of men and  
Make-believe  
I can be found.  
  
Plans I've made  
A masquerade  
Fading in fear of the coming day  
Heroes' tales  
Like nightingales  
Wrestle the wind as they run away.  
  
And if you ever hear them calling out  
And if you've been by paupers crowned  
Between the worlds of men and make-  
Believe  
I can be found.  
  
Garden gate  
An empty plate  
Waiting for someone to come and fill  
Scarecrow's dreams  
Like frozen streams  
Thirst for the fall  
But they're running still.  
  
And if you ever hear me calling out  
And if you've been by paupers crowned  
Between the worlds of men and  
Make-believe  
I can be found.

Seeing you again  
Was like meeting for the first time  
In a foggy dream so many years ago.  
Strangers in an airport  
Searching for a word to break the ice.  
Holding you again  
Even for the briefest moment  
Made me realize how much I love you still  
Wanting you to want me  
Still not knowing if you ever will.  
  
Seeing you again  
Seeing you again  
Was the sweetest torture  
I may ever know.  
Seeing you again  
Seeing you again  
Made me wish  
I'd never let you go.  
  
Seeing you again  
Running free along the beaches  
Where our shadows first  
Began to intertwine  
Listening to your laughter  
Wishing that you love could still be mine.  
  
Seeing you again  
Seeing you again  
Was the sweetest torture  
I may ever know.  
Seeing you again  
Seeing you again  
Made me wish  
I'd never let you go.  
  
Did you only come to say  
You're sorry  
Or give it one more try  
Or did you only need to see  
There was nothing left for me  
Inside worth saving.  
Running for your train  
You smiled back through the doorway  
Like you used to  
When our hearts still beat as one  
And as I turned away  
I knew the lonely days had just begun.  
  
Seeing you again  
Seeing you again  
Was the sweetest torture  
I may ever know.  
Seeing you again  
Seeing you again  
Made me wish  
I'd never let you go.  
  
Seeing you again  
Seeing you again  
Was the sweetest torture  
I may ever know.  
Seeing you again  
Seeing you again  
Made me wish  
I'd never let you go.  

She's got a way of getting so inside you  
That you think she's gonna steal your soul  
She's got a way of making sure that you can't let go.  
She's got a trail of broken hearts behind her  
Like a shadow where no shadow's cast  
I ain't the first one and I doubt that I'll be the last.  
Too long--too late  
You're wrong  
To ever think she'd wait.  
  
She don't look back.  
She don't look back.  
The lady don't look back  
  
And when she's gone she's gone.  
You can never tell just what she's after  
You can never read it in her eyes  
And in her laughter there's no hint of compromise.  
You can stare into the fire forever  
You can squeeze a stone until it bleeds  
But you will never find the kind of love she needs.  
Too much--too late  
You're such a fool to think she'd wait.  
  
She don't look back.  
She don't look back.  
The lady don't look back  
  
She don't look back.  
She don't look back.  
The lady don't look back  

So you've heard I've been flyin'  
And tryin' to get into  
Somebody new  
And I'm off on a new love  
And don't hardly ever  
Think about you.  
  
He's gotten so cold  
He ain't the same old  
Lover you used to know.  
He's in a nose dive  
Barely half alive  
And just about to let go.  
  
Someone's been telling you stories  
Someone's been telling you stories  
Someone's been telling you stories  
And they just ain't true  
No, they just ain't true.  
  
So you heard I got laid  
And betrayed by a maid in a one night stand  
And I'm caught in the middle of something I don't really understand.  
He's gotten so lost  
He's been double-crossed  
By a change in the wind.  
  
He's gone solo again  
And he can't slow down now  
To pick up a friend.  
Someone's been telling you stories  
Someone's been telling you stories  
Someone's been telling you stories  
And they just ain't true  
No, they just ain't true  
They just ain't true.  
  
So you've heard I've been flyin'  
And tryin' to get into  
Somebody new  
And I'm off on a new love  
And don't hardly ever  
Think about you.  
He's gotten so cold  
He ain't the same old  
Lover you used to know.  
  
He's in a nose dive  
Barely half alive  
And just about to let go.  
  
Someone's been telling you stories  
Someone's been telling you stories  
Someone's been telling you stories  
And they just ain't true  
Oh no, they just ain't true  
They just ain't true.

Now the wind is still  
In a moment it will be raging  
Now my soul is young  
In a moment it will be aging.  
And high above the pines  
I wrote several lines  
And left them in a bottle  
For you to find.  
  
Now the dream is rising  
In a moment it will be past  
This breath is my first  
It will all too soon be my last.  
  
And on a windy coast  
I made several toasts  
To you and me and the sea  
And no one heard.  
  
Now the wind is still  
In a moment it will be raging  
Now my soul is young  
In a moment it will be aging.  
  
And high above the pines  
I wrote several lines  
And left them in a bottle  
For you to find.

Broken clouds along the blue horizon  
The sun is setting and the wind is dying down  
Outward bound, there is music all around  
Can you hear it, it's the song of the sea  
  
Soundings taken at the edge of darkness  
The widest silences the heart can ever hear  
You can steer to the stars along your lee  
Set you bearings to the, the song of the sea  
Oh and the song is as ancient as the days  
  
And the winds upon the waves  
Let it carry you away, so far away  
Trim my sails to greet the breaking morning  
Past the headlands to the rolling open sea  
And it comes to me, I have never felt so free  
As when I'm listening to the, the song of the sea  
Oh and the song is as ancient as the days  
  
And the winds upon the waves  
Let it carry me away, so far away  
Some were meant to watch the world from windows  
And never look beyond the road beneath their feet  
But for me, I was always meant to be  
One forever chasing the song of the sea  
  
The song of the sea  
The song of the sea

Here is a poem  
That my lady sent down  
Some morning while  
I was away.  
Wrote on the back of  
A leaf that she found  
Somewhere around Monterey.  
  
And here is the key  
To a house far away  
Where I used to live  
As a child.  
They tore down the building  
When I moved away  
And left the key unreconciled.  
  
And down in the canyon  
The smoke starts to rise.  
It rides on the wind  
Till it reaches your eyes.  
When faced with the past  
The strongest man cries...cries.  
  
And down in the canyon  
The smoke starts to rise.  
It rides on the wind  
Till it reaches your eyes.  
When faced with the past  
The strongest man cries...cries.  
  
And here is a sunrise  
To set on your sill.  
The ghosts of the dawn  
Moving near.  
They pass through your sorrow  
And leave you quite still...  
Sitting among souvenirs.

Stood out in the rain  
Let it soak me down  
Before I called you . . . I called  
You didn't see me there  
Hidden by the rain  
Beneath your window . . . but I saw you  
  
Putting on your face before the  
Mirror on the wall  
Dreaming that the looking glass was me  
Catching your fondest gazes  
Living through your fickle phases  
I love you  
  
And it's getting easier each day  
To weep about you  
Harder every night to sleep without you  
How many years must I be driven  
By this dream  
Of love with you?  
  
Spend my dimes on phones  
Trying just to talk but  
You don't answer . . . you let it ring  
  
Spend my nights alone  
Catching falling stars to  
Give to you, love  
They're just for you  
  
For stars fall every time a  
Lover has to face the truth  
And far too many stars have fell on me  
And as they trail the skies  
And burn their paths upon my eyes  
I cry  

Every time we speak, our words betray intentions  
Insincere inventions that never quite reach the heart  
So we turn the other cheek and gather our defenses  
Again rebuild the fences that just been keeping us apart  
  
Waiting out the worst, we keep the best inside us  
In hopes our hearts can hide us, in hopes our tears don't show  
And you know we're not the first to try and breach the distance  
And though we meet resistance the love between us grows  
  
And in the time it takes us to look beyond the lies  
We could be sailing through each other's eyes  
And in those stolen moments when love is caught off guard  
We see it never had to be this hard

Have you seen the sunlight pouring through her hair  
And felt her warm mouth on you in the summer's air  
Running in a field of brown, laughing, rolling on the ground now  
Smiling as she pulls you down  
That's the way she feels about you  
That's the way she feels about you  
If your dreams should wake you shaking in the night  
She can touch your face and take away all fright  
Like a tree in a meadow wind she will bend to take you in  
Makes no difference where you been  
That's the way she feels about you  
That's the way she feels about you-yeah  
If you wake up screaming, scared about what you're dreaming  
You know she is there, she can share  
You're aware she cares about you  
In the morning wake up laughing with the day  
She will smile and ask you with her eyes to stay  
Like the sunshine warms the sand  
She will touch you with her hand now  
Touching makes you understand  
That's the way she feels about you  
That's the way she feels about you  
La la la la la la  
La la la la la la  
If you wake up screaming, scared about what you're dreaming  
You know she is there, she can share  
You're aware she cares about you  
In the morning wake up laughing with the day  
She will smile and ask you with her eyes to stay  
Like the sunshine warms the sand  
She will touch you with her hand now  
Touching makes you understand  
Oh that's the way she feels about you  
That's the way she feels about you-yeah  
That's the way she feels about you  
That's the way she feels about you

Two hearts  
Throwing off sparks  
Young and in love with  
Our freedom  
Moonlight,  
Those soft, southern nights  
We were both ripe to fall.  
  
I was  
Out on my own  
Playing for all who  
Would listen  
You were  
As free as a bird  
Flying from nest to nest.  
  
But somewhere our eyes met  
And our hands reached out  
And we felt a kindred spirit  
And as our faces touched  
I could feel the fire  
And needed so to just  
Be near it.  
  
Oh, lord  
Those moments we soared  
Borne on the wings of  
Our passion  
It seemed then  
Like they'd never end  
But times like that  
Always must.  
  
'cause then one day I flew  
Far away from you  
I never knew how I'd regret it  
My sweet magnolia belle  
You know I've loved you well  
Even if I never said it.  
  
Magnolia, now I see  
That freedom isn't free  
And love's the only true  
Redeemer  
And when this journey's  
Through  
I'll be coming back for you  
If you'll have this  
Foolish dreamer.  
  
I spend  
A night now and then  
Passing through town on  
My travels  
But someday  
I'm gonna come back to stay  
Magnolia, I'm coming home.

The winds of the heart  
They are as fickle as the weather  
The winds of the heart  
They are as constant as the moon  
They blow us apart  
And just as quickly turn  
And blow us together again  
And we don't know how  
And we can't say when  
No we can't say when  
The workings of time  
They are the face of love in motion  
The workings of time  
They are as secret as the sea  
It seems such a crime  
We should waste our love  
Deciding whose fault it should be  
We it might be yours  
But it might be me  
Oh, it might be me  
Well, they say that love is jealous  
And they say that love is blind  
And they say that love is  
Always in a hurry  
But the face of love's forgiving  
And the face of love is kind  
And the grace of love is there  
For all to find  
The winds of the heart  
They are as fickle as the weather  
The winds of the heart  
They are as constant as the moon  
They blow us apart  
And just as quickly turn  
And blow us together again  
And we don't know how  
And we can't say when  
No we can't say when  
They say that love is jealous  
And they say that love is blind  
And they say that love is  
Always in a hurry  
But the face of love's forgiving  
And the face of love is kind  
And the grace of love is there  
For all to find  
Well, they say that love is jealous  
And they say that love is blind  
And they say that love is  
Always in a hurry  
But the face of love's forgiving  
And the face of love is kind  
And the grace of love is there  
For all to find

The higher you climb,  
The more that you see.  
The more that you see,  
The less that you know.  
The less that you know,  
The more that you yearn.  
The more that you yearn,  
The higher you climb.  
  
The farther you reach,  
The more that you touch.  
The more that you touch,  
The fuller you feel.  
The fuller you feel,  
The less that you need.

So many try to capture love  
And so many never do  
So many hearts are lost  
With never a clue.  
  
So many nights are passed  
in sorrow  
So many days go by  
So many lovers lose  
And never know why.  
  
Still the lovers in the  
backseats claw  
And still the wives wait up  
Everybody's trying desperately  
to fill their loving cup.  
  
All through the night  
We thrust and parry  
Letting our best sides show  
Then in the morning light  
We lie and let go.  
  
Everyone searching for somebody  
Someone to kiss and tell  
More often than not  
Our heavens turn into hell.  
  
Still the lovers in the  
backseats claw  
And still the wives wait up  
Everybody's trying desperately  
to fill their loving cup.  
  
So many try to capture love

Our heavens turn into hell.

Everybody's trying desperately  
to fill their loving cup.  

Tell me a secret  
Tell me a lie  
Tell me the truth if you have to  
Say what you see fit  
But don't ask me why  
Love never seems to last you  
  
In times like these  
It's hard to keep a man off his knees  
In times like these  
It's hard to keep a man off his knees  
  
Over a barrel  
Under a spell  
Money's the demon that drives you  
Limping through heaven  
Or running through hell  
Happiness smiles but denies you  
  
In times like these  
It's hard to keep a man off his knees  
In times like these  
It's hard to keep a man off his knees  
  
Nothing before you  
Nothing behind  
Thoughtlessly chasing the thunder  
Travelling lightly  
Travelling blind  
Never detouring to wonder why  
  
Tell me a secret  
Tell me a lie  
Tell me the truth if you have to  
Say what you see fit  
But don't ask me why  
Love never seems to last you

It's hard to keep a man off his knees  
In times like these  
It's hard to keep a man off his knees  
  
Nothing before you  
Nothing behind  
Thoughtlessly chasing the thunder  
Travelling lightly  
Travelling blind  
Never detouring to wonder why  

Watching the sun  
Watching it come  
Watching it come up  
Over the rooftops  
  
Cloudy and warm  
Maybe a storm  
You can never quite tell  
From the morning  
  
And it's going to be a day  
There is really no way to say no  
To the morning  
  
Yes it's going to be a day  
There is really nothing left to  
Say but  
Come on morning  
  
Waiting for mail  
Maybe a tail  
From an old friend  
Or even a lover  
  
Sometimes there's none  
But we have fun  
Thinking of all  
Who might have written  
  
And maybe there are seasons  
And maybe they change  
And maybe to love  
Is not so strange  
  
The sounds of the day  
They hurry away  
Now they are gone  
Until tomorrow  
  
When day will break  
And you will wake  
And you will rake your hands  
Across your eyes and realize  
  
That it's going to be a day  
There is really no way  
To say no to the morning  
  
Yes it's going to be a day  
There is really nothing left to say but  
Come on morning  

Wandering shepherd, wander no more  
Wandering shepherd, wander no more  
Wandering shepherd, wander no more  
Lay down your troubles, your worries and woes.  
  
Traveling pilgrim, rest for the night  
Traveling pilgrim, rest for the night  
Traveling pilgrim, rest for the night  
Sup with the Savior and drink of his Light.  
  
Homeless believer, find here a home  
Homeless believer, find here a home  
Homeless believer, find here a home  
You may be lonely but never alone.  
  
Wandering shepherd, wander no more  
Wandering shepherd, wander no more  
Wandering shepherd, wander no more  
Lay down your troubles, your worries and woes

Look...what you're doing  
Baby what in heaven are you thinking of?  
Look...what you're doing  
Will you throw away such sweet, sweet love,  
Will you throw away such sweet, sweet love.  
You used to say that you would always stay  
But now you say you want to find your freedom.  
But are the promises of being free  
Worth the sacrifice of all you had with me.  
You know I've always tried the best I could  
To prove my love to you and make you happy  
And once upon a time if felt so good  
What has happened now to make you want to fly.  
Do you want to see me cry?  
Look...what you're doing  
Baby what in heaven are you thinking of?  
Look...what you're doing  
Will you throw away such sweet, sweet love,  
Will you throw away such sweet, sweet love.  
I ain't the fool that you believe I am  
You tell your lies but I can see right through them.  
Cause in your eyes I see another man  
But he will never love you like you know I can.  
Oh, girl, you know I can.  
(You better open up your eyes and)  
Look...what you're doing  
Baby what in heaven are you thinking of?  
Look...what you're doing  
Will you throw away such sweet, sweet love,  
Will you throw away such sweet, sweet love.  

Up every morning long before day  
Cooking her breakfast alone  
She quietly dresses  
And pulls up the shade  
And sits in the chair by the phone  
  
But nobody ever comes by anymore  
Nobody ever calls  
Most days she sits and just stares  
At the windows and walls  
Windows and walls  
  
Children all married  
Husband's passed on  
Nothing but time on her hands  
Most of her mornings  
Are spent in her dreams  
Or making her sad little plans  
  
Maybe she'll go to the corner today  
And pick up the new McCall's  
If just to escape for an hour  
From her windows and walls  
Windows and walls  
Windows and walls  
  
The clock on the mantel  
Chiming the hours  
Must be the loneliest sound  
She washes her dishes  
And waters her flowers  
And afterwards has to sit down  
  
Sometimes she still  
Can remember a child  
Playing with china dolls  
Now all that she's left  
Are these memories  
And windows and walls  
Windows and walls  
Windows and walls  
Windows and walls  

Wysteria, did you change your face again  
Those of us who loved you when  
Can't even find you.  
Wysteria, did you lose another man  
Did you make him understand  
That he can't touch you.  
  
Wysteria, did he take you to the fair?  
Were the folks that you met there  
The same that we met?  
Wysteria, did he teach you how to dance  
Did he bring you paper fans to hide your secret?  
Was he just like all the rest  
When he got to the sad part  
Did he stay a bit too long  
To save his heart.  
  
Wysteria, are your lips still lily white  
Do they still bloom just  
At night and die at sunrise?
