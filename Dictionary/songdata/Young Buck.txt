Now we can't lose fo' sho'  
Ya'll niggaz wanna know what we did this is what we did nigga  
  
Extended the family world-wide, recruited a couple comrades  
I was a chosen one due to my chrome gats  
Bad ass lil' nigga wit' a trash bag now I gotta confess it  
Every day arrested  
  
Niggaz wanna test this to get at the hoes  
So even mamma stay invested, damn that's cold  
Bitches seventeen years old, round 100 kilos  
Half of y'all pickin' pot out your nose with Afros  
  
Rollin' with the big boys soakin' up game  
And we'll be back seat with the Cartier frames  
The easier it got nigga the harder it came  
But I stayed in the game, that's the heart in this mayne  
  
There'll be hell on earth if I stay in the game  
Talk about kickin' up dirt like the broncos plane  
Call me the macho man when it comes to dirty ways  
A hato's man feel crime don't pay  
  
All my life, I visualized me handlin' mine  
And fuck waitin', 'cause God ain't promising time  
So now I'm drawin' a line before I get too far behind  
Lord, if I'm lyin' strike me down on time  
  
All my life, I visualized me handlin' mine  
And fuck waitin', 'cause God ain't promising time  
So now I'm drawin' a line before I get too far behind  
Lord, if I'm lyin' strike me down on time  
  
The last verse I wrote, I burned my hand  
'Cause there's only so much heat, that my hand can stand  
I'm too hot to spit that, you not you get that  
Don't get to height or this glock'll click back  
  
I bitch smack niggaz and I ain't that mean  
My chopper gon' do you proper look at what that did  
I'm clip flipin', pistol grippin', dippin', set trippin'  
Believe me you don't wanna see me wit' the 4tec spittin'  
  
You bull-shittin', I'm just goin' live by you guys  
My whole team roll me homey, ride or die  
Ridin' high, Sheaf and do-do like I'm in Cali  
I'm type this one for the block and blast from the alley  
  
I'm raw wit' it Tony Montana, extra banana  
Interstate from my way down to Atlanta, comes from a scanna  
Just crossed the Tennessee line  
All my life, I visualized me handlin' mine  
  
It's all for one and one for all nigga  
  
All my life, I visualized me handlin' mine  
And fuck waitin', 'cause God ain't promising time  
So now I'm drawin' a line before I get too far behind  
Lord, if I'm lyin' strike me down on time  
  
All my life, I visualized me handlin' mine  
And fuck waitin', 'cause God ain't promising time  
So now I'm drawin' a line before I get too far behind  
Lord, if I'm lyin' strike me down on time  
  
Now let ya nuts hang nigga  
Start up the engine in the cut thang nigga  
Brang pain to these niggaz, ice on my trigga finga  
Let the world know, I'm a balla when I came for the scrilla  
  
Gorilla they gon' label me  
Ain't no way y'all bitches gon' disable me, put me on cable TV  
Peace treaties ain't accepted here, blood-bath  
Split him in half now nigga from his feet to his ear  
  
If I don't know ya then its fuck ya, we ain't talkin' shit out  
Catch me at ya people, we jus' sparkin' shit out  
Yeah, I'm so hood, that bullshit you spittin' ain't no good  
I bust a nigga weave, act like poppin' a car hood  
  
You want ya gurl back, pay the fee and it's all good  
Until I cop a 7-series beamer wit' all wood  
My whole team makin' riches we shinin', we ball good  
You can boss and Young Buck'll catch us our hood  
  
All my life, I visualized me handlin' mine  
And fuck waitin', 'cause God ain't promising time  
So now I'm drawin' a line before I get too far behind  
Lord, if I'm lyin' strike me down on time  
  
All my life, I visualized me handlin' mine  
And fuck waitin', 'cause God ain't promising time  
So now I'm drawin' a line before I get too far behind  
Lord, if I'm lyin' strike me down on time

Bang bang  
  
Bang bang  
  
Bang bang  
I shot you down, bang bang  
You hit the ground, bang bang  
That aweful sound, bang bang  
I used to shoot you down  
  
Don't nobody want to die, but everybody want to ball  
Somebody gotta go, when them killa's call  
You know it's in us all, you just gotta find it and use it  
You can get away with it, if you don't abuse it  
The streets talk, the beats mark, 'cause that heat comin'  
And if they know that you did it, you better keep runnin'  
I think I see sumthin, there go my enemy  
Only lord knows where this nigga f'nd to be  
Tennakee, still the price is as real if you look it  
Might give it to you for 5, depend on if I took it  
Nigga anything goes, my shop never close  
From the nickels and the dimes to the whole kilo  
The real niggas feel me, the haters want to kill me  
But I'm holdin' down my city, me and this 9 milli  
While your throwin' bricks, and hidin' ya heads  
Homie, I know where you hang  
Ain't no thang to walk up and let that chopper go...  
  
Bang bang  
I shot you down, bang bang  
You hit the ground, bang bang  
That awefull sound, bang bang  
I used to shoot you down  
  
Now all the gangsta's pray  
Lord, forgive me  
But he tried to kill me  
Somebody out there gotta feel me  
Lord, forgive me  
But he tried to kill me  
Somebody out there gotta feel me  
  
Just think if I ain't empty the clip, and he killed me  
Would I still be livin'?, would my homeboy's miss me?  
How many niggas bust they gun when they have to?  
Don't need no ski mask when it's time to get at you  
I'm glad you done seen what it look like when we left  
Brain fragments from shot-gun blasts'll take a nigga breathe  
It's death before dishonesty, dope deals and robbery  
Poppa wasn't around, but that shit didn't bother me  
I'd probably be in the penitentary  
But I played the cards, the dead lord sent to me  
The whole truth, I use this booth to speak to my thug niggas  
Why you mad at me? the government's the drug dealers  
Before I let this police kid harass me  
This rookie ass cop gon' have to blast me  
He asked me for identification, I looked at him and laughed  
He made a move and I heard a blast  
That's what you get, bitch  
  
Bang bang  
I shot you down, bang bang  
You hit the ground, bang bang  
That awefull sound, bang bang  
I used to shoot you down  
  
Now all the gangsta's pray  
Lord, forgive me  
But he tried to kill me  
Somebody out there gotta feel me  
Lord, forgive me  
But he tried to kill me  
Somebody out there gotta feel me  
  
It's goin down around here nigga  
Get ya muthafuckin head bust  
Them muthafuckin street lights go out  
And them real niggas come out  
All the bitch niggas go in the house  
Just not a game, man  
Don't fuck around and lose your brain  
And hey, all my real niggas pray  
  
Lord, forgive me  
But he tried to kill me  
Somebody out there gotta feel me  
Lord, forgive me  
But he tried to kill me  
Somebody out there gotta feel me  
  
Lord, forgive me  
But he tried to kill me  
Somebody out there gotta feel me  
Lord, forgive me  
But he tried to kill me  
Somebody out there gotta feel me

Dem gangsta niggaz from J.C. center court 12th, 3rd Avenue, my block  
Nigga, murder, murder mayne  
I come nake faceded, ain't no need for a ski-mask  
From neck down, I'm black down, eye to eye when I blast  
No question, I got the code  
Now how many bodies out there, take out before I reload, hit 'em below  
His fuckin' knees, before we leave, we gon' locate them ki's  
A nigga gotta eat, ya heard me?  
You know the player when we get there, kill everything in there  
Leavin' no clues, like we never even been there  
Life ain't fair but fuck it, it's a new year  
I'm grabbin' my strap, cockin' it back and boo-yaa  
We almost thay, lock down the spot  
Put your vest on punk, we in the parking lot  
One of them, all day killers, who's hard to spot  
Jackin' all y'all whether it's dark or not  
It's blood in, blood out and you know what I'm about  
I'm ridin' high, nigga, I'm ridin' high  
So don't get in if you ain't about it spendin' it big  
'Cause I'm clearin' the block, oh, I'm clearin' the block  
It's blood in, blood out and you know what I'm about  
I'm ridin' high, nigga, I'm ridin' high  
So don't get in if you ain't about it spendin' it big  
'Cause I'm clearin' the block, we clearin' the block  
We did our job, now we on the next mission  
The next victim, go on, see if the tec spittin'  
No bullshittin', see they don't know just how we livin'  
I'm goin' all out, I ain't scared to go to prison  
Make your own decision, it's gon' be a long ride  
I need the money, I can't wait a long time  
Keep a strong mind 'cause we done waited in a long line  
Just to get our shine on, now it's our time  
Believe that, it's our turn  
Pull out your weapon to burn, get what you earned  
We all must learn, that money is the key to life  
And niggaz gon' die if we ain't eatin' right  
It's blood in, blood out and you know what I'm about  
I'm ridin' high, nigga, I'm ridin' high  
So don't get in if you ain't about it spendin' it big  
'Cause I'm clearin' the block, oh, I'm clearin' the block

Niggaz snow off that white, goin' out and sheddin' blood  
Life lookin' like my momma said it would  
Whether or not, I still ride for the hood, I'm on my block  
My niggaz they slang rocks, shoot it out with cops  
From J.C., the center court life's hard knocks  
Hold on, grab your glock, did you see the car stop?  
Which one? The black Benz with the top dropped  
Fuck 'em, the mac-10 with the infrared dot  
Represent how I'm livin', keep on drivin' down the block  
Oh, it's on now, let's take the back route  
Get your mac out, it's blood in blood out  
It's blood in, blood out and you know what I'm about  
I'm ridin' high, nigga, I'm ridin' high  
So don't get in if you ain't about it spendin' it big  
'Cause I'm clearin' the block, oh, I'm clearin' the block

So don't get in if you ain't about it spendin' it big  
'Cause I'm clearin' the block, oh, we clearin' the block  
Clear the block, shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up  
Nuttin' but gangsta niggaz be clearin' the block  
Ay man, Rizin Sun and Buck  

[Chorus]  
Woke up screaming fuck the world today I, had it up to here  
Ex-girlfriend got custody today cause, they say she feels  
That I'll never be the daddy that she, wants me to be  
Hardest thing I've ever had to do, sayin' bye to my seeds, ohhh  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Damn, look at what I call my life, a glock-9  
And a eightball of white, I got mine  
Well, not quite, I got signed  
And fifty put me right in the light, it took time  
Meanwhile I'm livin the life  
Where a nigga just might see prison tonight  
My rent due, baby need food and shoes  
I'm flat broke, still I refuse to lose  
So I smoke, lookin' for the fools with jewels  
I'm 'bout to see if it's true what a Uzi do  
Nobody cares, and life ain't fair or free  
The best thang you can do is say a prayer for me  
And how dare, y'all try to lock me up  
You not here, so you ain't really givin' a fuck  
But I swear, as long as I'm breathin', I'm hustlin'  
I'm thuggin', and this is the reason because I  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If you see me in a suit and tie (in a suit and tie)  
Tell all my niggaz goodbye (tell my niggaz goodbye)  
Tell 'em that I'm on my wayyyyy (tell 'em I'm on my way man)  
Say a prayer for me and hug the kids (hug the kids)  
Tell God all of the shit I did (the shit I did)  
And how the kids looked up to me (cause they did look up to me nigga!)  
Yeahhhh  
  
Heyyy, holla if you feel my pain  
I been to hell and back, and I'm still the same  
The block hotter than flames, but we sell the 'caine  
Putti'n all kind of thangs in our baby's name  
Tell the hoes "I'm rich bitch" like my name Rick James  
I really ain't got shit, but I can't complain  
Cause L.T. got life, and Big Ju got fifty  
Jimmy did his ten and D doin his twenty  
Come get me, seems like it's no way out  
So when I say "Dirty," you say "South"  
Tryin' to put my hands on somethin', brush off my shoulders  
Buy up some land or somethin', get what they owe us  
You don't have a plan, you're nuttin' is what they told us  
Remember what the O.G.'s showed to the soldiers  
Gotta make it to heaven or die tryin' to get it  
The day dude fuck with Dre, I was feelin' like  
  
[Chorus]

Life ain't 'posed to be like this, robbery and poverty  
24 hour shifts to keep this cocaine off of me  
Y'all ain't livin' how I'm livin', one mo' week I'm seein' prison  
'Cause to get what I'm after, a nigga might be missin'  
I ain't listenin' to shit, hit the Sweet and load the clip  
'Cause if crime didn't pay, then I'd be still on the strip  
You niggaz still runnin' yo' lips, I be runnin' them zips  
Up and down the interstate, makin' ten G's a trip  
A hardheaded nigga, do whatever it takes  
To go and get that bread nigga, heard what I said nigga?  
Been misled for a long time, waited in a long line  
Finally I'm here, now this rap game is mine  
Keep the herb burnin', ain't nuttin' changed 'cause I'm worth somethin'  
Y'all know the Young Buck, I'ma leave this earth bluntin'  
But still carry, the chrome Dirty Harry  
'Cause your boy got to have that, by any means necessary  
Hey, I can't keep livin' this way  
'Bout to load up my fuckin' AK  
My mission is to go and get paid  
Get paid  
Hey, I can't keep livin' this way  
'Bout to load up my fuckin' AK  
My mission is to go and get paid  
Get paid  
Ain't no nigga out here heaven-sent, not on these streets  
E'rybody want the Presidents 'cause niggaz gotta eat  
So I try to leave no evidence and come when you sleep  
In your residence nigga until my mission's complete  
Stay draped in my heat, paranoid like that  
You kill me? R.I.P. I got boys like that  
Who said they needed a white pack to strike back, shit  
Just give me the right mac and nigga I'll be right back  
Hardcore, and show these niggaz they don't want war  
You want more? Well gimme what I'm here for  
Y'all know I been raw, from day one  
This teenager with the big boys, gettin' the job done  
Got a daddy, but he ignored both of his sons  
Had to pay for my own way, as a child on the run  
I ain't scary, the AK-47, I married  
'Cause a nigga had to have that by any means necessary  
Hey, I can't keep livin' this way  
'Bout to load up my fuckin' AK  
My mission is to go and get paid  
Get paid  
Hey, I can't keep livin' this way  
'Bout to load up my fuckin' AK  
My mission is to go and get paid  
Get paid  
Look what y'all done to me, forced a nigga to this point  
Wouldn't feed me when I was hungry, I couldn't ignore it  
But I stay to my lonely, and didn't show it  
So when I killed you and your homies, you wouldn't know it  
Cristal I let you po' it while I fuck with the Hennessey  
All this time I'm the nigga that you pretend to be  
Tables done turned now I'm like remember me?  
The same lil' nigga you overcharged for a ki  
Times hard on a G, you was larger than me  
Young, but I ain't dumb, you ain't smarter than me  
Give niggaz a inch, and they takin' the whole mile  
So I hop out the 6, and I takin' they whole pile  
Uh-uh whoa now, how many niggaz see this grown child  
Shit gettin' hectic then you shut 'em down  
Tennessee to Uptown, niggaz is thuggin', mean muggin'  
Ain't no stoppin' I'm hot, and the game is what I'm lovin' nigga  
Hey, I can't keep livin' this way  
'Bout to load up my fuckin' AK  
My mission is to go and get paid  
Get paid  
All my nigga say  
Hey, I can't keep livin' this way  
'Bout to load up my fuckin' AK  
My mission is to go and get paid  
Get paid  
Hey, I can't keep livin' this way  
'Bout to load up my fuckin' AK  
My mission is to go and get paid  
Get paid  
Nigga  
Hey, I can't keep livin' this way  
'Bout to load up my fuckin' AK  
My mission is to go and get paid  
Get paid  
Get money nigga

And pop the Crys  
I gotta find me a model  
I like 'em thick  
I make her hop in my Impala  
Go take a trip  
Clean off my shoe and pop my collar  
I'm rich, bitch  
Oh, what, you never seen a balla?  
Well, this is it  
I make that pussy feel good  
Till you tell me quit  
And I won't tell nobody that you let me hit  
Psych!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Young Buck]  
Okay then, shawty, if you ready

Let's take it from the dirty to the East and West Coast  
A couple shots of Patron  
Let's have a sex show  
I got a lot but' baby  
You can be my best ho  
I see you watchin' a playa  
She like my dress code  
Rockin' these Cartier's  
Drinkin' that X-O  
I know a place that we can go  
And get low  
You wit' a gangsta  
You ain't never felt like this before  
And if you know that pussy good  
Then hit tha floor  
Shake that ass like you should  
Go get that dough

So come on

The hustle never stops so my job is never done (ayy!)  
So tell me what it costs (costs) and show me who the boss (boss)

If you wanna know the reason why I act like that

If shorty wanna hate, then tell the bitch to walk  
Let your money talk (Hey!) I let my money talk for me  
  
Call me what you want, but you can't call me broke (broke)  
Cause gettin' big bags of money's all we know (know)  
Marble floors in the projects, ghetto millionaire  
All this Gucci in my closet, I don't know what to wear (yeah!)  
Bentley outside by the ice cream truck (truck)  
Just ride through the hood, ask 'em if they seen Buck (Buck)  
Thought I wouldn't make it, but look at me now  
That's why I painted the Benz the same color as Cristal (Let's go!)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Get money!!  
Hey, get money!!

I brush my teeth, load my clip, and go bust my heat  
I'm in too deep, I can't say fuck the streets  
I need some sleep, the fiends still comin'  
Bush 'bout to blow this bitch up  
Better get money, dead bodys get picked up  
I'm David in teen's now  
Niggas we're digital, but they work triple beams now  
I'm livin' for me now, 'cause I done went to war with the other side  
Lucky me, 'cause the enemies mother and brother died  
Hot shot gun shell's and teflon chest plate's  
It's tatt'ed on my arm nigga, thugin' till my death day  
Ya'll niggas just wait, right after my court date  
It's gonna get grimey, like new york say  
Bitch niggas horse play, real niggas gon' spray  
Bang the fo', change clothes, and come back the same day  
Better holla mayday, 'cause we comin'  
And we gunnin at any muthafucka want sumthin  
  
They say thou shall not steal, thou shall not kill  
But rub me the wrong way, nigga and I will  
Thou shall not cheat, thou shall not squeel  
'Cause niggas'll put a hole in ya ass, and that's real  
They say thou shall not steal, thou shall not kill  
But rub me the wrong way, nigga and I will  
Thou shall not cheat, thou shall not squeel  
'Cause niggas'll put a hole in ya ass, and that's real  
  
I'm already dead, can't kill me nigga  
And even if I do die, I'm still gon' kill ya  
I'm unfamiliar with a lot of these soldiers  
I go out in the road, and niggas think that it's over  
Runnin, the fiends all puttin too much soda on the d'  
You would think niggas know, 'cause they older than me  
Been here longer than me, and still peace'n a ounce out  
How can ya' be a birdman, if you don't know how to count  
It's back to the black gloves, and home invasions  
Puttin holes in a nigga, the size of a gold dayton  
No I'm not waitin on nothin, no more  
Eather you pay me what you owe me, or I'm cuttin ya throat  
Nigga ya baby momma know me, go and ask the hoe  
How I done tied her ass up over a bag of dope  
I'll be glad to go to the pen over revenge  
I'm comin' out the same way, a nigga went in  
  
They say thou shall not steal, thou shall not kill  
But rub me the wrong way, nigga and I will  
Thou shall not cheat, thou shall not squeel  
'Cause niggas'll put a hole in ya ass, and that's real  
They say thou shall not steal, thou shall not kill  
But rub me the wrong way, nigga and I will  
Thou shall not cheat, thou shall not squeel  
'Cause niggas'll put a hole in ya ass, and that's real  
  
Boom!, g-unit!!!, we on some military shit nigga  
You better kill us all, 'cause we commin'  
Muthafucka's!

[Intro]  
Nigga, G-Unit Nigga!!  
Dayum.. I neva knew dis rap shit  
Could have a nigga beefin' wit his own homebois, ya'know?  
Shit fucked up, but dis how it goes...  
[Verse]  
Came up (Yuh!), I did my thang  
Dis is so real I ain't sayin' no names (Nah!)  
Started wit' a dream like Martin Luther King  
'Till tha Fed's came sayin' my whole fuckin' team (Huh!)  
Switched my game up, started from tha bottom (Why?!)  
My Daughter on tha way I don't need these problems (Aiight)  
Find me a new job - I wanna rap  
So I got myself a new squad, got out tha trap  
Didn't have too many niggas ridin' wit' me then (Uh)  
But now everybody wanna ride in my Benz (Uhh!!)  
Dis one nigga dat I called a friend of mine  
He was really right there when I didn't have a dime (Yeahh!)  
But I stayed on tha grind, waited in tha line  
Thinkin' dat we'd both git rich in due time (Nigga!)  
My blessin' came and people started to listin  
It's G-Unit now so I put him in posission (Owh!)  
To ride wit' a nigga, and make his own bread  
Can't give him tha world but hayell, I did what I can  
He got a lil' man dat he called his artist (Yeah!)  
I took him right in like "Damn, let's start dis." (C'monn!)  
Brought him round 50 to show him what he got  
He looked at me quickly and said he was hot  
We was on our way, straight to tha top  
But my homeboi feel like his man need to drop (Uh ohh)  
His frustration kicks in, now here we go  
My homeboi feelin' like I owe a lil' mo'  
Meanwhile dis tha 1st week my album out (Okayye!)  
Shit my own damn mama didn't have a house (Phureal!)  
Stay focused tha way I post dis  
When tha lights on, you can see tha roaches (Uh huh)  
Shit got bad, my homeboi really got mad  
'Cause he started losin' everythang dat he had (Aahh!)  
Nobody to blame but who else, Guess who?  
He started sendin' threats sayin' what he gon' do (Whudd!!)  
Now I can't live around dis beef stuff (Nah)  
Dis ain't New York, my city ain't big enough  
So I'm lookin' fo' my homeboy wit' guns and shit (C'monn)  
Askin' The Lord how did it come to dis (Why?!)  
There he goes, right there with his toy souljas  
I'm all by myself, let's git dis ova  
Dogg down on the whole crowd, don't nobody move  
Where my homeboi at, what he say he gon' do? (Huh!)  
Outta nowhere, my homeboi show his face (Aye!)  
But one of his souljas pull a gun from his waist (Dayum!!)  
I started to shoot, but I looked in his eyes  
And then I realized dat he didn't wanned die  
So it's back to my homeboi, Wussup now?!  
He like "Damn Buck, you really actin' fucked up now"  
I'm like "Nawhh, niggas say you trynnah kill me."  
Glock still out nobody gittin' near me (Unh uh)  
A car door opens, and who do I see?!  
My homeboi artist who was down wit' me  
He holla "Put ya guns down, and put ya hands up" (What?!)  
I wadn't thinkin' I just fucked ya man up  
Picked up my strap, hopped in my 'Lac truck (C'monn)  
Told my homeboi "Ya mayn's an act up" (Nigga!!)  
Weeks went by, and we got back cool  
First it's shame on 'em, then it's shame on you (You!)  
'Cause these same ol' dues dat I let back round (Okayye)  
Doin' all kinds'a shit behind my back now  
Wanna sleep wit' tha enemy to make some noise? (Aiight!)  
But dis how it go in tha streets, when you war witcha homeboi  
[Outro]  
They smilin' in ya face  
All tha time they wanna take ya place (Backstabbas.. Backstabbas..)

[Chorus: Young Buck]  
They was glad I was broke, mad 'cause I'm rich  
So put that nigga out if it's a hater in this bitch (uh-oh!!)  
Stuntin in the club, make 'em start a riot  
Throw my hood up then go take it outside  
[Repeat]  
[Verse 1: Young Buck]  
Why you hate me nigga? Yo baby momma love me  
She see me in the club, and runs up and hug me  
I show her no love, she keep on comin back  
Tellin me she got yo club, and where yo money at  
It must be my 'Lac, that's sittin on Pirellis  
The way I count stacks, that's got these niggas jealous  
See I'm hard on a hoe, I get down for mine  
You need a hand-out bitch, don't waste ya time  
If you don't work (you don't work), you don't eat (you don't eat)  
We go to jail, go to church, go to sleep  
I'm ridin' 'round wit Scrappy in the A wit my heat  
Tryna figure out how to get to Peachtree  
Come on nigga  
[Verse 2: Lil' Murder]  
Young nigga, but a certified playa  
But youse a bitch nigga, youse a bonafide hater  
They was glad I was broke, but now I'm livin major  
Hustlin and servin niggas like a waiter for the paper  
We ridin down the strip in sumthin so wet  
When ya bitch see a nigga, wanna suck a nigga dick  
Smokin' dro and drinkin' liquor till a nigga get sick  
Every city, every state, it's the same ol' shit  
Nigga money make the world go 'round so get ya hustle on  
These niggas snitchin' so much, I'm like "fuck a phone"  
Mad 'cause I'm on, they love to see me down  
I know you gon' let me shine and get mine  
Nigga  
[Chorus]  
[Verse 3: All-Star]  
Look, hatin' ain't healthy, nigga so keep it movin'  
These shots will wake ya whole hood up, I'm sleepin' through it  
Chea, I'm used to it, I done made a gun fire  
Pull the trigger one time, sound like a gun fight  
You was glad I was broke, now ya mad 'cause ya hoe  
Love it when a nigga put it in the back of her throat  
Buck, Hi-see, Murder, and Star, we ain't never scared  
I don't need my pistol in the club, I'll brawl there  
I know hustlers that do deal white  
Jump stupid, find out what these boots feel like  
Yea, y'all know me, All-Star I'm so street (yea)  
What it is, what it ain't, what it gon be  
[Verse 4: Hi-C]  
I don't bust my gun, like a halftime football game  
I aimed straight and I took y'all name  
And ya whole click look all lame  
You can catch me in the house with a pyrex and it cook all caine  
Put that metal in ya mouth, you gon swear I was doctor walls  
I'm in the club with my muthafuckin' glock in drawers  
I had to let my nuts hang, so I dropped my balls  
You ain't hit him wit no bullets nigga shot the walls  
You shoot to scare, I aim and kill  
When I dump on you, they gon think yo brain ain't real  
I'm heavyweight in the game, you featherweight  
When they hear a nigga take a loss, they wanna celebrate  
Bitch  
[Chorus]
