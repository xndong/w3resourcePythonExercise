You dumb or some, i went to refugees  
  
Silly felony, when i'm done  
  
Collect royalty from record company's  
  
Clouds getting darker  
  
Suns getting nearer  
  
I'll turn a atheist into a god fearing believer  
  
The back of a building  
  
Your body's found by children  
  
Playin' hide go seek  
  
All we found was his skeleton  
  
In the back of a car  
  
You spawned with the wrong guard  
  
You know my empire strikes back hard  
  
Listen hard, war  
  
This is the day after action  
  
Projects, cannons  
  
Being launched at the palace  
  
Vision, revelation  
  
Sky know apocalypse  
  
Enemy pilots kamikaze into the abyss  
  
  
Chorus:  
  
  
Apocalypse..

Verse Two:  
  
  
Aiyyo, Back on earth  
  
The party is in the tunnel  
  
On the west side of the river  
  
Went mad quiver  
  
Rats get fed to the alligator  
  
Gun blast equivalent to the bombs in pearl harbor  
  
Rescue choppers broke the turn to hiroshima  
  
I'm driving to jersey to escape the terror  
  
I was on the highway pushing a black viper  
  
A car pulls up, is he a jack or a sniper (sniper)  
  
A blue range rover, he says pull over  
  
I didn't know he was a DT undercover  
  
I screamed out my lungs  
  
This is discrimination!  
  
He tried, he said you just robbed a gas station  
  
Who me? not me! it couldn't be  
  
I was in the Grammys with Brandy  
  
Didn't you see me on tv?  
  
Bullshit, y'all all in the same game  
  
He tried to run me off the road  
  
Like he was rosco, rico or dre  
  
I stayed calm, gave him a hell of a show  
  
Cause when its time to go  
  
All i gotta press is turbo  
  
Heard it on his walkie, road block on 280 west  
  
Things got serious, that's when i bust a left  
  
you-Turn, my eyes burned  
  
My concern was a truck coming  
  
Head on collision within a chase position  
  
Close one, i almost went up in a blaze  
  
Running from what appears to be a masquerade  
  
Least that what i thought, it was all in my mind  
  
Reality stuck when i got to the borderline  
  
The headline reads every ghettos sad story  
  
A rookie shoots a boy over mistaken identity...  
  
(crash)  
  
  
Chorus repeat (2X)

When I was young, Mama played a guitar  
A microphone and she said I'd go far  
She said, "Just keep all the lyrics hardcore"  
Listen to my talk and get up, I'm on the corner with my...  
  
Hey kids, gather around, it's Wyclef and Melky Sedeck  
I got a story to tell, heeeeeeere we go  
  
Sit right back and hear a tale of a hustler 'round my way  
He used to clock around the block from where my grandma stayed  
Black BMW with rims to match, windows bulletproof  
One night, he jumped out the car  
and caught a bullet in his bubblegoose  
He caught a bullet in his bubblegoose  
He caught a bullet in his bubblegoose  
You can be at the party gettin' loose  
But you can catch a bullet in your bubblegoose  
  
Hey yo, hey yo, my pen's in my hand, what should I write next?  
Oh yeah, and if you don't know, success brings stress  
I'm vexed, my phone rings, collect call from Jeff  
The operator say, "If you accept, say yes"  
"Yes, what's the deal, son?"  
"Yo, I got bad news"  
Yo, by the tone of his voice, I heard the ill street blues  
"The friends will make you, then too can break you  
They plan an execution like Fu Man Chu"  
"Who?"  
"You know the character from channel 5 kung-fu (wahoo)"  
"Slow down, man, Jeff, I'm losin' you"  
"Hey yo, your cousin Rohann..."  
"Uh-huh"  
"Who used to sell bang"  
"Uh-huh"  
"DT's found his hand in the back of Binnigans..."  
"What?"  
"In a plastic bag with a note attached"  
"Saying what?"  
"A million and a half or he won't be back"  
"So meet me by the Brooklyn Bridge, 12:00 sharp"  
"If not, at the funeral, you gotta play the harp"  
Yo, why they wanna start and make me play my part?  
Don't they know like Sting, I can turn this murder into art?  
I jumped into my car, there's gotta be a joke  
Traffic's backed up, who's in town, the Pope?  
S-s-s-s-someone blew the horn, I turned and looked left  
To my surprise, it was my sis, Melky Sedeck  
  
Sit right back and hear a tale of a hustler 'round my way  
He used to clock around the block from where my grandma stayed  
Black BMW with rims to match, windows bulletproof  
One night, he jumped out the car  
and caught a bullet in his bubblegoose  
He caught a bullet in his bubblegoose  
He caught a bullet in his bubblegoose  
You can be at the party gettin' loose  
But you can catch a bullet in your bubblegoose  
  
You're shootin' in the opposite position  
I'm thiniin', "Should I fire or hold back on ammunition  
On your wig transition?"  
My mission, like Take 6, is to spread love  
But all you screwed mugs got me wearin' black gloves  
You up in my face, I see the fear in your eyes  
You wanna feel the pain like a grown man gettin' circumcised  
Shalom, shalom, pardon my left  
But my right hand's on your throat, massaging you to death  
You provoke the cycle, call Michael  
You're lookin' in the mirror, well, I'm in your window, oh oh  
You hear me Urkel, your blood will turn purple  
Like the colour, you holler, ballin' for your mother  
No-one hears you even though you knock  
You used to walk around the block with the daily rock  
Things done changed since your spark got hot  
Now you got your knot wocked with your very own glock  
  
Sit right back and hear a tale of a hustler 'round my way  
He used to clock around the block from where my grandma stayed  
Black BMW with rims to match, windows bulletproof  
One night, he jumped out the car  
and caught a bullet in his bubblegoose  
He caught a bullet in his bubblegoose  
He caught a bullet in his bubblegoose  
You can be witcha girl gettin' loose  
But you can catch a bullet in your goose  
He caught a bullet in his bubblegoose  
He caught a bullet in his bubblegoose  
You can be at the party gettin' loose  
But you can catch a bullet in your goose

Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy  
This one goes out for everybody that lost somebody  
Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy  
Be strong  
Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy  
  
Now I understand what Scarface meant  
When he said I never seen a man cry till I seen a man die  
Never in my deepest thoughts that I would imagine  
I would be the one carrying a coffin  
Yo I feel like a orphan even though I got a mom  
I'm the first born so I gotta play strong  
Memories of the past bout when we cried when we laughed  
It makes it hard, dad, for me to finish write this paragraph  
I remember when we all shoved snow frost bites and all  
Temperature forty below  
You used to call me lazy cause I said it was too cold  
But you would go in the crib fix me a fresh cup a cocoa  
I can't front  
I wish there was a sequel of the sixth sense  
So I could see dead people  
I'm so hurt, dad  
I can't cry no more  
But I know that you're knockin on heaven's door  
Peace  
Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy  
Rest in peace, dad  
Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy  
All my people live on  
Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy  
Rest in peace, dad  
Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy  
  
Look into my eyes  
Realize I'm the same man my father was  
y'all can tell by my Pink Cadillac  
The way I clean my ride  
Old grim tilted to the side  
But what I loved most was when the God philosophize  
About the philosophies of life in its reality  
Keep the right mentality  
Don't fall into vanity  
Sometime I feel like he standin watchin over me  
Whisperin in my ear, baby boy, I'm still here  
I heard him said I'm the shadow right beside you  
And if you confused, son, I'm there to guide you  
And even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death  
I fear no evil  
For the Lord is wit me  
But don't forget that your mom's in your hands  
You two were so close  
That I finally understand  
And here's a message to your brothers and your sisters  
I'ma miss em  
No matter what I'mma be wit em  
Peace  
  
Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy  
To my dad, rest in peace  
Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy  
I guess I'll see you at the resurrection  
Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy  
To all my people that lost somebody  
Da, daddy, daddy, daddy  
Put the lighters in the air  
Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy  
Oh, daddy  
Oh, daddy  
Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy  
Oh, yeah, yeah  
I need you, daddy  
Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy  
Oh, oh  
Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy  
Daddy  
Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy

I gotta know this yo  
  
What makes a DJ  
What makes an MC  
What makes the ReFugees  
Why are kids getting jealous?  
  
'Cause we F, are, E, S, H  
Fresh, fresh, fresh, that's, fresh!  
F, are, E, S, H  
Fresh, fresh, fresh, that's, fresh!  
  
Hey you, player, with the dibble and the dabble  
You want to battle who? Wyclef or DJ Skribble  
Hold the stickup it's a freestyle session  
Skribble where you from man  
Well I'm from Haiti, then Brooklyn, then Jersey  
With a universal tag, plus I got  
You slept on this musician, plus the hip-hop art  
Bring your best MC's  
'Cause every man got disciples if you ever want a rival  
Show up, with a mic, and a rifle  
Wyclef stuck the bank at mid-day  
And took all of Sony money, in a black van he got away  
I just got a call from Tommy Mottola  
He said forget about it "oh my word"  
So I held John Agrassia, at gunpoint  
He's shook, callin' Donny Aiena, while smokin' a joint  
I said, 'Who's the informer?' They say, 'Michael Malden'  
I had to take him out "Three the hard way!"  
The moral of this story don't blame the record company  
If your record ain't selling you lack creativity  
  
But what you want me to say? What what you want me to say huh?  
Yo I've been trying to get a deal for, years and it ain't  
What you want me to say?  
  
"And I'll kill anyone, who dares to go against me!"

This is as real as it gets y'all  
And it don't get no realer than this  
This is as real as it gets y'all, huh  
  
Maybe my mother, coulda been my father  
Perhaps it was my sister, probably my brother  
Maybe the church, coulda been the street  
Perhaps it was the guitar, or Jerry Wonder beats  
Maybe the money when I didn't have a dime  
Maybe a way out before committing crimes  
Coulda been Lauryn, perhaps it was Pras  
Probably the mirror looking dead in my eyes  
Coulda been reggae, or the love of hip-hop  
Maybe my fans at the show saying don't stop  
Probably the struggle of all refugees  
Maybe the sign how the diamonds bling-bling, ching-ching  
Ring ring, there's a call from my wifey, whoo  
Perhaps I gotta make it home but music keep calling me  
And maybe it's all I know, whatever it is I'm grateful for being  
  
A man with a guitar, a dude from the streets  
A cat with a song, a ReFugee MC  
Wyclef Jean, a Fugee for life  
A preacher's son, first one on the run  
I'm grateful that I haven't been shot  
Stopped by the cops and they didn't find a glock  
W-Y-C-L-E-F, I'm grateful  
  
Coulda been a crack fiend with no place to go  
Lord, oh mighty God, have mercy on my soul  
Coulda been Pablo, king of Yayo  
Or a pimp with a limp screaming we don't love them hoes  
Oh no, God knows, perhaps I was chosen  
A source of inspiration for the next generation  
And maybe it's all I know, whatever it is I'm grateful for being  
  
A man with a guitar, a dude from the streets  
A cat with a song, a ReFugee MC  
Wyclef Jean, a Fugee for life  
A preacher's son, first one on the run  
I'm grateful that I haven't been shot (shot)  
Stopped by the cops and they didn't find a glock (glock)  
W-why-see-L-E-F, I'm grateful  
  
Everybody sing along now  
You can make it like I made it  
Don't let anyone tell you different  
When doors close another door will open  
Many have called but my people are chosen  
You can make it if I made it  
Don't let anyone tell you different  
When doors close another door will open, yeah  
Many have called but my people are chosen, yeah  
  
A man with a guitar, a dude from the streets  
A cat with a song, a ReFugee MC (yeah)  
Wyclef Jean, a Fugee for life  
A preacher's son, first one on the run  
I'm grateful that I haven't been shot (shot)  
Stopped by the cops and they didn't find a glock (glock)  
W-why-see-L-E-F, I'm grateful

If it was my last day on earth  
I'd treat it like my first  
Go out the way I came in  
So innocent so pure with no thoughts of insecurity  
Live life to the fullest be what I wanna be  
Last day on earth  
  
I tell my momma don't cry I'll see my daddy in paradise  
Where the blind can see, the mute can talk, the crippled can walk  
But for now Heaven's in New York  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Heavens in New York  
Oh oh oh oh  
  
First thing I'd do is go back in time take the twin towers, put it back in the
skyline  
Tell my girl two wrongs still don't make a right  
Make love for the last time under the candlelight  
Pick up my hommies at the gentleman club after that hit  
Club and Reminisce about the High School Days  
Man I sucked as a quarterback remember getting sacked man almost broke my back
yeah  
  
If it was my last day on earth  
I'd treat it like my first  
Go out the way I came in  
So innocent so pure with no thoughts of insecurity  
Live life to the fullest be what I wanna be  
Last day on earth I tell my girl don't cry I'm with my daddy in paradise  
Where the blind can see, the mute can talk, the crippled can walk  
But for now Heaven's in New York  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I tell the man get the people a tax break  
Kids stop shootin' I cant sing in no more ways  
I cant take the money with me so I caught a movie  
Favorite actress Angelina Jolie  
Favorite Singer has to be Marley  
Turn Up the Bass  
And move to his styling's  
Cant leave without reading my daughter a bedtime story the heavens is calling  
  
If it was my last day on earth  
I'd treat it like my first  
Go out the way I came in  
So innocent so pure with no thoughts of insecurity  
Live life to the fullest be what I want to be  
Last day on earth I tell my homies don't cry I'm with my daddy in paradise  
Where the blind can see, the mute can talk, the crippled can walk  
But for now  
Heaven's in New York  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Welcome to New York City  
Even though I walk through the Valley of Shadow of Death I fear No evil  
For you are with me so tell my loves ones please don't cry  
Cause if doves can fly so can I  
  
If it was my last day on earth  
I'd treat it like my first  
Go out the way I came in  
So innocent so pure with no thoughts of insecurity  
Live life to the fullest be what I want to be  
Last day on earth I tell my homies don't cry I'm with my dad in paradise  
Where the blind can see, the mute can talk, the crippled can walk  
But for now

Last day on earth I tell my homies don't cry I'm with my daddy in paradise  
Where the blind can see, the mute can talk, the crippled can walk  
But for now Heaven's in New York  
Where the blind can see, the mute can talk, the crippled can walk  
But for now  
Heaven's in New York  
  
[Chorus x3]  
  
Welcome To  
New York City...  
Heaven's In New York City

However you want it, you don't want it, cuz when you get it it hurts  
Your body carried out the church  
Mom, she be cryin holdin on to her purse sayin... (oh my baby!)  
They shoulda took me first  
However you want it, you don't want it, cuz when you get it it hurts  
Your body carried out the church  
Mom, she be cryin holdin on to her purse sayin... (oh...)  
  
Aiyyo  
What y'all thought I was too busy writin songs with Whitney Houston  
Cuz "My Love's Your Love" will be my slugs wit blood  
For any thug that wanna bang and play orangutang  
Find yourself in the river with the rest of them  
Wake up, wake up, I'm in a nightmare dream  
Where I found myself loadin magazines after magazines  
Ski mask on my face, gun on my waist  
Fine pens shakin in my hand as I write this next line  
You look strange, shootin victims at close range  
And saw his vein burst from his neck, as I snatched his chain  
Is this a Bible, I used to read the Gospel  
Until I got betrayed by one of my twelve disciples  
Which one, look through the crowd son  
You could spot the traitor wit a tatto on his arm  
The symbol is a microphone, an intellectual  
A wannabe Rakim, but too extraterrestrial  
I heard he's lethal and I'm too rusty to battle him  
Me being rusty is like Biggie not being "Born Again"  
It never happen, watch who you call fam  
On MTV, he painted himself as the tin man  
Predicted platinum, way before it happened  
So that's why when you ship gold, you only sold aluminum  
  
And now you wanna tell everybody I messed up your record?  
C'mon!  
  
However you want it, you don't want it, cuz when you get it it hurts  
Your body carried out the church  
Mom, she be cryin holdin on to her purse sayin... (oh my baby!)  
They shoulda took me first  
However you want it, you don't want it, cuz when you get it it hurts  
Your body carried out the church  
Mom, she be cryin holdin on to her purse sayin... (oh...)  
  
You a thug? You aint a murderer, just an undercover caligula  
Cuz when you saw the luger became silent like Caesar  
Enough of this rap stuff, Sedeck take his watch  
If I wasn't rappin, I'd take that stash in your left socks  
Don't make me raise my voice cuz I'm masterin a coo  
So, and besides when they find you you'll be bones  
Mom say watch my peers, hangin like chandeliers  
Orderin Don P, you couldn't pay for one beer  
Perpetratin, a fraud, oh god, you aint hard  
Take thirty of y'all to murder one kid on the boulevard  
You want Wyclef Jean, bring your same thug guys  
Here's my advice, leave the ring with your bride  
Cuz you aint comin back no more  
We gon send you to a vacation for two, with crabs on the seashore  
You freeze up, hold up I really thought you was psychotic  
Is that tears in your eyes? You cryin for your life  
Kid you tellin me what you did, you didn't wanna do  
Watch what you say on record cuz it might come true  
  
However you want it, you don't want it, cuz when you get it it hurts  
Your body carried out the church  
Mom, she be cryin holdin on to her purse sayin... (oh my baby!)  
They shoulda took me first  
However you want it, you don't want it, cuz when you get it it hurts  
Your body carried out the church  
Mom, she be cryin holdin on to her purse sayin... (oh...)  
  
Should I take them? Should I wait?  
Should I take them? Should I wait?  
Should I take them? Should I wait?  
I say "No Woman, No Cry" like I should own a piece of the estate  
But at the tribute they didn't invite me  
So I put in a call to Halis Alassi  
He said be easy, aint no need to bust a shot (BLOW! BLOW! BLOW! BLOW!)  
Like Supercat said, yo the ghetto's red hot  
Before bling, bling, bling it was BLING, BLING, BLING!

Every woman have a snapping point  
You don't want her to snap no  
  
Someone stop Linda  
She just left the crib with a beretta  
She's on her way to pop her fiance  
It's the word on the street  
He was sleeping with Renee  
Lord knows, please someone stop Linda  
He don't even know she's coming  
Like the FBI, she gon' knock down the door with no warrant  
Lord knows, what happened to the good time lovin', lovin'  
  
My father used to tell me, son, listen  
There's a thin line between love and hate  
Once you cross that line, see there's no escape  
She love me, she love you not  
You don't want to open up Pandora Box no, no  
She will see that two men cheating  
When you said that two men working  
All I'm saying is just watch your back  
'cause tonight see I got a bad feeling Jack  
Linda's got a gat  
  
Someone stop Linda  
She just left the crib with a Beretta  
She's on her way to pop her fiance  
It's the word on the street  
He was sleeping with Renee  
Lord knows, please someone stop Linda  
He don't even know she's coming  
Like the FBI, she gon' knock down the door with no warrant  
Lord knows, what happened to the good time lovin', lovin'  
  
Listen to me now  
Every barrel got a Linda  
Trust me you don't want that drama  
When you laughing she's crying  
Mascara running down her face, now she's plotting  
Like Method Man, she gon' bring the pain  
Like Cypress Hill you got a insane in the membrane  
All I'm saying is just watch your back  
'Cause tonight see I got a bad feeling Jack  
Oh my God  
  
Someone stop Linda  
She just left the crib with a beretta  
She's on her way to pop her fiance  
It's the word on the street  
He was sleeping with Renee  
Lord knows, please someone stop Linda  
He don't even know she's coming  
Like the FBI, she gon' knock down the door with no warrant  
Lord knows, what happened to the good time lovin', lovin'  
  
Someone stop Linda (Samson fell for Delilah)  
Someone stop Linda (Ahab fell for Jezebel)  
Someone stop Linda (King David fell for ?)  
And coming in the mist  
Linda wants to head up the baptist  
Someone stop Linda  
He don't even know she's coming

Let um feel the beat first  
I'm bout to come through your stereo  
Should my rhyme start with the hook  
Start with the hook  
  
To my people who don't want to go to work  
Thank God it's Friday  
Cover me she bout to put up her skirt  
Thank God it's Friday  
  
Do Your mom now you act so berserk  
Thank God it's Friday  
What's the track, what's the track girl?  
She don't want to, she don't want to work on Monday  
(I want to thank my hood)  
  
For makin' me a star before I had fast cars  
And couldn't tell the difference between Whoppers and caviar  
Before the fame  
Way before things changed  
  
All I wanted to do was freestyle and get a name  
I used to work at the fast food restaurant  
For minimum wage  
Dreamin' I'm on stage  
  
At 17 I left the house  
'Cause my father was a minister  
And I didn't want the Marvin route  
What's goin' on?  
  
Today to sell a song you need a video with soft porn  
MC's in the industry  
You want to tip?  
Don't let them pimp you like Goldy  
  
And tell Sony they better have my money  
'Cause I play wit the Comodores and be like Lionel Richie  
Low Income, I stay so hungry that if 50 Cent came to rob me  
He'd be part of my charity  
(I want to thank my hood)  
  
To my people cuttin' here in the shops  
Thank God it's Friday  
To the thugs sweatin' up in the chop shops  
Yo, it's Friday  
  
To my people that don't got no job  
Everyday it's Friday  
What's the track, what's the track yo?  
She don't want to, she don't want to work on Monday  
All the Ladies sing  
  
I don't feel  
Like cookin' you no breakfast  
This mornin'  
(Wyclef: All my hoodlums say)  
  
You don't have  
To cook me breakfast  
'Cause your girlfriend will  
After you leave  
(I want to thank my hood)  
  
For the love of money  
I know kids who'll slit your throat  
Friday the 13th  
Jason wit a trench coat  
  
But you can't scare Suzie  
Cause her man got so many uzi's you'd think he was Cadivi  
Meanwhile, she's getting her nails done  
Crystal clear so they could shine like wit diamonds  
  
It's such a shame what happened last week  
Man they found her under the sheets with a letter from the Son of Sam  
It said to tell New York I ain't sleepin  
You want to be clubbin then you better pack your heat in  
  
And to my man G Swar Rest in Piece  
I still poor liquor  
1 draw on the cocoa leaf  
Inhale, exhale smoke grasses  
  
Polices in the area, but ain't no need to panic  
You wit Wyclef you getting in  
If not, then we gonna make CNN  
(I want to thank my hood)  
  
To my people who don't want to go to work  
Thank God it's Friday  
Cover me she bout to put up her skirt  
Thank God it's Friday  
Do your mom know you act so berserk?  
  
Thank God it's Friday  
What's the track, what's the track girl?  
She don't want to she don't want to work on Monday  
Yo, to my people cuttin here in the shops  
  
Thank God it's Friday  
To the thugs sweatin up in the chop shops  
Yo, it's Friday

Everyday it's Firday  
What's the track, what's the track yo?  
She don't want to she don't want to work on Monday  
All the Ladies sing  
  
I don't feel  
Like cookin you no breakfast  
This mornin  
(Wyclef: All my hoodlums say)  
  
You don't have  
To cook me breakfast  
'Cause your girlfriend will  
After you leave  
  
(Daddy, play that guitar)

Hold on now, don't die now, be strong now  
He said, I was born a crack baby  
In a plastic bag in the alley  
Raised in a foster home  
With no mother to love and I never knew my papi  
Back in the days of Bobby McFerrin  
Used to sing don't worry, be happy  
Lord how can I be happy  
When I don't even know my own family tree Lord  
  
We are the next generation, we ain't scared to die  
The only thing I fear is the after life  
'Cause I don't know what's there on the other side  
But I pray the Lord forgives me, gives me one more try  
  
Gang poppin' things, doing drive-by's and angers  
Kids going to school putting fears in their teacher  
The teacher let them know that it ain't all good  
'Cause the gang was created to protect the neighborhood, now  
All you red now, all you blue now  
All you yellow now, follow me now  
To that place of righteousness  
Where the only thing that matters is your consciousness, he said  
  
We are the next generation, we ain't scared to die  
The only thing I fear is the after life  
'Cause I don't know what's there on the other side  
But I pray the Lord forgives me, gives me one more try  
  
In my father's kingdom there are many mansions  
All the rooms are free, there is no tax collection  
I can see Biggie, Tupac, Moses and Abraham  
Jason, the one and two's, jamming with the sun of man  
  
I've been kicked, I've been stabbed  
I've been shot, I've been ? by a  
Person that I thought I trusted, where I live  
It's a war at the cribs, walk with a strap  
Myself 'cause I don't want nobody's son on my back  
My mind playing tricks ?, to really ?  
Me out in five unless I take another hit  
I done seen the sun set on the other side of town  
Now I'm drifting in the darkness, Heaven hold me down  
? but I know I'm born dying  
Feel the tears of the angels looking down on me crying  
For a lying ass but yo forgive us in a while  
And I'm sorry, never let me forget that I'm your child  
While I'm locked up in this basement staring eye to eye with Satan  
In this cold dark world with no patience  
We get plotted on by agents with talks of replacing  
The Africans, Jamaicans and the Haitians in this next generation  
  
We are the next generation, we ain't scared to die  
The only thing I fear is the after life  
'Cause I don't know what's there on the other side  
But I pray the Lord forgives me, gives me one more try  
  
Whoa, we the next generation, look at what we facing  
The kids raise themselves, all kind of temptation  
Flowers and candles decorating all the pavements  
No, the perpetrator ain't seeing no arrangements  
Nobody cares about the feelings of the poor  
Man they suffer while we spending eighty billion on a war, uh  
Cutting school budgets, US stockmarket plummets  
Condition's only worse and I wonder what become it  
Metal detectors replace music classes  
Angry little kids want to beat their teacher's asses  
The red and blue's, somebody gotta lose  
Reality TV be reality for who  
I don't question what the Lord found in me  
I just pass it on to folks with no boundaries  
Got a long road ahead of us, AIDS already gettin' us  
Now we got stars, how many will there be left of us  
  
We are the next generation, we ain't scared to die  
The only thing I fear is the after life  
'Cause I don't know what's there on the other side  
But I pray the Lord forgives me, gives me one more try

It's funny how the Earth rotates, man you never know what's  
going to happen, ya know mean?  
All I said was "Aiight, I got this chiki bang bang dang da dang"  
Then it all got it started for me, man  
Yo, man I'm just getting back from the tour, man  
What it be like, man?  
Yo, bust it, turn me up  
Somebody told me if you can make in New York City, man, you can  
make it anywhere else, man  
Somehow I believe that shhhh  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, what a night  
Late December, 1993 (what happened?)  
Who thought he would rule the industry?  
What an MC on the grind  
  
Yo, I ain't always have whips, I ain't always have yachts  
I ain't always have chips, I ain't always have rocks  
Matta fact I was a grimey little negro  
Who said if music didn't work, I'd sell diesel  
What cha'll thought, I wasn't raised in the projects?  
First of the month waitin for that PA check  
Lived on the first floor  
Were so poor that if you rung the buzzer the roaches would answer the door
(who is it?)  
I went from boy to man in one night  
When I saw my life flash like light from poltergeist  
What made it worse, I couldn't speak English  
But from his facial expressions, he wanted my Adidas  
So hurry up and come out and play  
I'll be damned if I leave bare-footed in this hallway  
And I got big plans, so beg your pardon  
Cause next year this time I'ma sell out the Garden  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yo, yo, I ain't gonna brag and boast and say I did it all  
But I'm the only rapper to play Carnegie Hall  
The first rap group, video cost a million  
First rapper to ever rep for the Haitians  
And sa fa say, na boolay  
Grammy night, we took 3 away  
22 million sold, I can't believe this  
There's still ain't a rapper alive who could achieve this  
But I ain't satisfied, when back to my home contemplating  
How could I become the next Quincy Jones?  
That's when Jerry hit me up on the horn and said  
"Clef, your on the cover of  
the cover of The Source by The Rolling Stones"  
No more struggling, good life we loving it  
You could live it too, if you only publish it  
So here we go, so what's the scenario?  
I own so many cars that I'm renting 'em for videos  
  
[Chorus]

I'm a take you to a place  
Where the trouble's I'm the base  
Where everybody's fine  
And there's no color line  
The only thing we see  
Is the party by the sea  
So lets call the refugee  
  
Vole, Vole, Vole, Vole  
Pompe, Pompe, Pompe, Pompe  
Sote, Sote, Sote  
Mete main nou anle.  
Met main nou anle  
Mete main nou anle.  
Met main nou anle  
  
If you come from the Caribbeans  
Lets show them how we do it  
Throw your flags in the air and wave it  
Ladies while you shake it break it (  
Ladies while you shake it break it

I'm only eight  
I got no choice but to sling crack  
  
Yo who you pushin' weight for  
Dog I ain't no rat  
Cause rats get found in the back of garbage trucks  
With they mouth taped up  
Lookin' like sittin' ducks  
Well you don't look like a sittin' duck and your mouth ain't taped up  
What more small the market, Clef  
You get stuck up  
With what  
From a fiend  
I just bought a twenty-two  
Now it's funny you should say that  
Cause the gun looks bigger than you  
Now get your ass back in the house  
Shut up!  
?  
From B.K. back to N.J.  
Crouchin' tiger style  
Let's go  
  
Feel it  
Feel it  
Peace God  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Peace God  
You gave me the voice to speak, God  
Speak God  
Wyclef Jean bout to hit the streets hard  
Peace God  
Peace  
You gave me the voice to speak, God  
Masquerade, my message to the streets, y'all  
  
Yo peace God  
These words came from a revelation  
Whether you free or you going through incarceration  
Inhale, exhale herbal meditation  
Put the fire arms away  
Cause we don't want no confrontation  
Not me, I'm talkin bout you jerk  
Cause when you die your life ain't even worth the paperwork  
So, peace God, even through war we bring peace  
And after the blood shed then your first son deceased  
And you will understand I'm the beginning of the end  
The alpha, omega, the present, and the future  
So hold on to your Winchester  
Cause the hollow tip penetrate lead through your polyester  
Peace God, even though we ice the wrist  
Guzzle the fifth  
Protect us with a crucifix, Lord  
And bless me with an extra clip  
So just in case one jam release my twin from my waistband  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Aye, yo peace God  
I ain't tryin' to see the graveyard  
But in this game of life I was dealt the wrong card  
I wasn't born this way it just came to be  
Sellin' crack through a alley where the fiends rally  
Where the dealer was the president  
And the fiend was the voter so they voted for the government  
And stick ups was only natural  
It seem every other day a new gun pointed at you  
Peace God  
Yo only God got the answer  
And sorry bout ya mom dyin' of cancer  
But congratulations, I heard you no longer a runner  
You a big man now, the black Tony Montana  
But watch out cause I heard wealth bring envy  
Trust me I did sing for the Kennedies  
Until we meet again feel my words through my pen  
And stay pure in the city of sin  
  
[Chorus: x4]

(This one's goin' out to the strip joints  
Yo, meet me at Suzy's Rendez-vous  
For every Go-Go Bar  
I'ma send this one out to the gentlemen's clubs  
Magic City, New York dogs, Rolex  
I be seeing y'all up in there late at night  
I understand when your girl is stressing you out  
(Crazy girls) Know what I'm saying?  
Don't let the ladies fool y'all now, fellas  
They be doin' the same thing y'all be doin'  
Turn up my symphony, man.  
Turn up my symphony!  
Drop a BEAT!)  
  
Just 'cuz she dances go-go  
It don't make her a ho, no  
Maxine, put your dance shoes on  
We going to the disco  
We gonna eeeelope to Meeeexico  
Called up my mama, said I'm in love with a stripper, yo  
  
Ten grand, let me see you shake it like you got no  
bones in your body and you was made to be a celebrity  
Twenty grand, know it's a sin, but before me you show  
me a little more skin it would fulfill my fantasy  
Thirty grand, to the highest bidder but Chris Rock  
said, 'There's no sex in the champaigne room'  
Forty grand, looked into her eyes, I saw tears falling  
down, type of tears that money couldn't buy  
  
Just 'cuz she dances go-go  
It don't make her a ho, no  
Maxine, put your dance shoes on  
We going to the disco  
We gonna eeeelope to Meeeexico  
Called up my mama, said I'm in love with a stripper, yo

We gonna eeeelope to Meeeexico  
Called up my mama, said I'm in love with a stripper, yo  
  
Excuse me, what is your name?  
  
Uh, my name is Hope, yo  
I was blessed with the body of the Goddesses  
Have you any idea how hard this is?  
I could flex in 25 positions  
But I only work here to pay my tuition  
Yo, tantalizing teaser  
Table-top pleaser  
Give me what I need a  
Mastercard a Visa  
Lap dance fantasy  
Picture us on and on white canopy  
Wyclef extended his hand to me  
Like Billy D. said he's feelin me  
Take me away from here, so far  
Where they ride horses, no cars  
No more stripping in bars  
Me and you 'Clef, against the odds  
  
Just 'cuz she dances go-go  
It don't make her a ho, no  
Maxine, put your dance shoes on  
We going to the disco  
We gonna eeeelope to Meeeexico  
Called up my mama, said I'm in love with a stripper, yo

We gonna eeeelope to Meeeexico  
Called up my mama, said I'm in love with a stripper, yo  
  
(Yo a lot of y'all sitting with y'all girls  
fronting like the budweiser commercial  
Talking bout, 'IIIIIII, I don't be going to the strip joints'  
You lying man! You'd be surprised who you see up in there man.  
I got one question for you liars, man)  
  
Shot callers, Wasn't you a preacher?  
You calling her a hooker? He without sin cast the first stone.  
I met her on the subway, she gave me that VIP card  
And told me if I ever have problems,  
Don't hesitate to come by, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
Just 'cuz she dances go-go  
It don't make her a ho, no  
Maxine, put your dance shoes on  
We going to the disco

Called up my mama, said I'm in love with a stripper, yo  
Call up my mama said I'm in love with a stripper yo!  
  
(Yo baby, can I get another lap dance? I tell you I  
got nothing but funny money, man. New York Dogs.)  

Yeah, election time's comin'  
Who you gon' vote for?  
Yeah  
  
If I was President  
I'd get elected on Friday  
Assassinated on Saturday  
Buried on Sunday  
They go back to work on Monday  
  
If I was President  
If I was President  
If I was President  
  
Instead of spendin' billions on the war  
I can use that money, so I can feed the poor  
Cause I know some so poor  
When it rains, that's when they shower  
Screamin', "Fight the power"  
That's when the vulture devoured  
  
If I was President  
I'd get elected on Friday  
Assassinated on Saturday  
Buried on Sunday  
They go back to work on Monday  
  
If I was President  
If I was President  
If I was President  
  
I know some soldiers  
That sleep, but they can't dream  
Wake up with screams  
Sounds of M-16s  
So take this medal of honor  
For your bravery  
I wish you the best kid  
You and your family  
  
If I was President  
I'd get elected on Friday  
Assassinated on Saturday  
Buried on Sunday  
They go back to work on Monday  
  
If I was President  
If I was President  
If I was President  
  
But the radio won't play this  
They call it rebel music  
How can you refuse it  
Children of Moses?  
  
Tell the children the truth, the truth  
It's not all that bling, that's diamonds  
Tell them the truth, the truth  
Most of y'all wear cubic zirconium  
Tell them the truth, the truth, yeah  
Your soul is worth more than diamonds and gold  
  
If I was President, all Blacks will have reparation, no segregation  
Feed the nation 'til there is no famine  
Muslims, Jews, Christians would all hold hands  
Every week on the beach, party by the sand, word up  
  
Take trips on Air Force One  
No need to bring the homeless  
With no sneaks to Air Force One  
Better schools in the hood  
Better teachers for the classes  
Makin' money, payin' no taxes  
  
Find the best scientists, tell 'em  
"Come up with the answer  
I want the cure for AIDS and Cancer"  
But I gotta watch my back  
Snipers on the hill, with the steel  
Man power, waitin' to JF kill  
  
If I was President  
I'd get elected on Friday  
Assassinated on Saturday  
Buried on Sunday  
They go back to work on Monday  
  
If I was President  
If I was President  
  
I feel a ring comin'  
Let me play my guitar for them right now  
Let's go  
Refugees  
Yeah

Intro  
Yea, oh!  
Check me out, look  
It goes love, hate, pleasure and pain  
Four albums in the can and I'm still in the game (what up?)  
And last album, they don't like me to tell this  
Debuted at number one and sold more records than Elvis (shut up!)  
That's what they telling me, switch up your melody  
Through with misdemeanors, they trying to give rappers felonies  
So they can lock us up one at a time  
But true writers stay free in every one of our lines  
And if you not feeling I'm the cream of the crop  
I'll knock rappers off your list 'til I get to the top!  
Still you looking at a man that's financially stable  
Only nigga getting checks cut from four different labels  
That Pillsbury dough, women poke my guts  
Still I walk around the streets like I'm broke as fuck  
So if you see me in your town and I appear to be moody  
It's cause I'm thinking 'bout plans that's bigger than Serena booty  
Me and shaka still starving and looking for meals  
And heads up! Ludacris is almost out of his deal  
I'm over ten million sold, every album is crack  
And for now I'm bout to carry def jam on my back  
Mad rappers I hear you talking way down at the bottom  
Though I make big money, still handle small problems  
The rambling at the mouth, I don't play that shit  
I'm the best and I ain't really got say that shit!

[Wyclef:] Yo Serj, pass me that lighter...  
[Serj:] Here you go man  
  
Yeah... yeah  
  
[Both:] Yeah  
  
[Serj:] The power is smiling through the battle field...  
  
The break is over man  
I'm fat with the ink pen  
Like Ali Boom Bayay  
Okay I'm on my second wind  
Used to roll dice when the love was on my side, man  
Four, five, six walked away with the Grammy  
Seen many blocks turn to the Twilight Zone  
D.A. on a case like Sherlock Holmes  
My old high school sweetheart started sniffin' a bone  
For the right bag she deep blow deeper than the baritone  
I caught you off guard, this verse is unexpected  
Check it  
Like when I rhyme don't big punch wreck it  
Check it  
I got a swagger that cut any rapper mind over matter  
Lyrical dagger like alcohol I got pull your liver  
  
Quiver, shiver body temperature can found in Hudson River  
Deliver a message to your miss you won't be commin' over  
And if you on a street tonight  
See that refugee local  
We beam around the world like satellite  
  
[Chorus: 1]  
It's the hip hop boys, turn your radio down  
It's the rock and roll boys, turn your radio down  
It's the reggae boys, turn your radio down  
Neighbors mind your business  
  
[Chorus: 2]  
It's a riot... Trouble (comin') again, your body's getting nervous  
See we're trouble (comin') again, body so unconscious  
You see we're trouble (comin') again, your body's getting nervous  
See we're trouble (comin') again, body so unconscious  
  
[Sizzla:]  
Come rock with me  
I got the music on the block with me  
Come chill on the spot with me  
  
I'm just laughin' spree  
  
Yeah you're right we got enough for everyone  
So get all your friends and your families and come along  
Move to the beat that's all we do  
We got Jerusalem  
Everyday we offer praises like King Soloman  
  
Don't be nervous  
I'm your guardian angel, I know you're nervous  
And if I look at you now  
If I should make it  
Believe me  
I leave you, show you how to make it  
  
Pump up high  
N M I  
Double S - I  
S - S - I  
P ? P - I  
Three peace child  
Want to see me die  
So the heaven's get cry  
  
[Chorus: 1]  
  
It's a riot!  
Riot!  
Riot!  
Riot!  
From the train to the plane  
Security check  
From the bridge to the tunnel  
Security check  
  
[Chorus: 2]  
  
[Wyclef (Serj):]  
Let's go to Texas...  
Driving wreck-less  
Police stop me  
Ask me for my license  
(Oh yeah)  
Registration so I played him some Elvis  
He let me go  
Then I lit on the challas  
I said if things don't change  
We headed for the Armageddon  
Armageddon  
And the great dragon with seven heads ten horns  
At the Armageddon  
Listen to the choired church...  
  
Oh  
Oh  
Oh  
  
[Serj:]  
The matterings of all matter  
Masters and their extended batters  
Internet intelligence firm  
Investments for the natural world  
Their divestments  
Truth is knowledge  
Although bipolar if it's attainment is equitable  
Man's mirrors face the flesh  
But hide the spirit  
In opposite worlds  
Vision can only be attained universally  
Lamps of varied sizes and shapes carrying different shades  
All having the propensity to illuminate  
Let's ruminate on realization  
That the means is the end  
The earth's water is mirroring the stream of consciousness  
The dead being reborn  
As flowers smiling through the battlefields  
  
It's the hip hop boys, turn your radio down  
It's the rock and roll boys, turn your radio down  
  
[Serj:] Power is smiling through the battle field...  
  
[Chorus: 2]

Yo, I'm a dedicate this to everybody that was at Woodstock '99  
DMX, Limp Bizkit, Sheryl Crow amongst many  
Yo, just before I got on stage this chick came on to me  
She offered me sumthin  
It looked kinda strange, it was in a bag  
I said "Yo, girl let me talk to you real quick"  
Yo  
  
I don't sniff cocaine 'cause it mess up my brain  
For sexual stimulation I never did no ecstasy  
I don't pop pills, I never did no LSD  
but I wouldn't mind a kiss from Ms. Mary  
'Cause  
  
She's homegrown and you can hold her in her backyard  
She's homegrown and you can get a kiss in her backyard  
  
I remember when I was a young boy  
I waited for my grandad, "So daddy can I get a puff?"  
He looked at me, he says "Son, man, you're too young kid"  
"When you get older now and you understand that"  
"I let you get one kiss from Ms. Mary"  
'Cause  
  
She's homegrown and you can grow her in her backyard  
She's homegrown and you can hold her in her backyard  
If she allows you to you can roll her up  
She's homegrown and you can kiss her in her backyard  
She's homegrown - I like to be with you Ms. Mary - in your backyard  
  
That's when she looked at me and she said  
"Wyclef this' what I want you to do son"  
  
Come on  
Inhale - exhale  
Exhale - inhale  
Inhale - exhale  
Now hold it now  
Inhale - exhale  
Inhale - exhale  
Exhale - inhale  
Now breath in my face  
  
Marijuan' Marijuan'  
  
She said that  
She's homegrown and you can grow her in her backyard  
She's homegrown, she said "'Clef, I'll kiss you in my backyard"  
And my daddy don't need to know  
She said that  
I'm homegrown and you can grow me in your backyard  
I'm homegrown and you don't need to worry for my backyard  
  
That's when I said, "I'ma get in trouble, I gotta go girl"  
This' what she said  
Laa la-laa laa laa, strictly la-la, to take me higher, and higher (2X)  
Laa la-laa laa laa, strictly la-la, to take me higher  
  
I'm about to take it higher  
I'm about to take it higher  
I'm about to take it higher  
I'm about to take it higher  
  
Come on y'all, come on y'all, come on  
Yo, I want for everybody sleeping on my guitar skills  
It's about to beat on right about now  
Turn my guitar up yo!  
  
What up Jimi Hendrix, I'll see you baby  
Yo, Carlos Santana, thanks for the lessons baby  
Yo, Steve Rod, I ain't forgettin you man  
To the godfather B.B. King  
and to my man Eric Clapton  
I think I'm forgettin somebody, man  
The Artist, ha-haaaaa  
Yo, Jerry Wonder, man,  
you're playin that bass like Bootsie Collins, man  
Don't hurt 'em baby boy  
Uh, Wyclef, Jerry Wonder man, new Millenium man, I told ya  

Ah ah ah ah  
  
Some live for the bill  
Some kill for the bill  
She wined for the bill  
Grind for the bill  
(And she used to be the sweetest girl)  
Some steal for the bill, if they got to pay they bill  
(And she used to be the sweetest girl)  
Tonight Wyclef, Akon, Weezy on the bill  
  
High school she was that girl that make me do the hula hoop around the gym  
(Just to get a peek again, she's a 10)  
High school she was  
That girl that make me do the hula hoop around the gym  
(Just to get a peek again, she's a 10)  
Never thought she would come and work for the president  
Mr. George Washington (where my money at?)  
She thought he'd call (where my money at?)  
She had a good day, bad day, sunny day, rainy day  
All she wanna know is (where my money at?)  
Closed legs don't get fed, go out there and make my bread  
All you wanna know is (where my money at?)  
She ended up in a road car, bruised up, scarred hard  
All you wanna know is (where my money at?)  
She thought he'd call (where my money at?)  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause I'm a tell you like you told me  
Cash rules everything around me  
Singin' dollar dollar bill y'all (dollar, dollar bill y'all)  
Singin' dollar dollar bill y'all (dollar, dollar bill y'all)  
Causes I'm a tell you like you told me  
Cash rules everything around me  
Singin' dollar dollar bill y'all (dollar, dollar bill y'all)  
Singin' dollar dollar bill y'all (dollar, dollar bill y'all)  
  
Pimpin' got harder cos, hoes got smarter  
On the strip is something they don't wanna be a part of  
Rather be up in the club shakin' for a thug  
For triple times the money and spending it how they wanna  
They got they mind on they money, money on they mind  
They got they finger on the trigger, hand on the nines  
See everyday they feel the struggle, but staying on they grind  
And ain't nobody takin' from us, and that's the bottom line  
But I know there's a draught in the block  
You move slow  
You getting' pressure from cops  
you don't know not to lay low  
Because 25 to life is no joke  
To all my real gorillas thuggin'  
On top of corners every day strugglin'  
All the beautiful women getting' money  
Washin' them dollar bills like laundry  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Money, money-money-money  
Money, money-money-money  
It drives the world crazy  
  
She used to be  
  
She used to be the sweetest girl  
She used to be the sweetest girl ever  
Now she like sour Amaretto  
She wears a dress to the T like the letter  
And if you make it rain she will be under the weather  
She used to run track back in high school  
Now she tricks on the track right by school  
She takes a loss cause she don't wanna see her child lose  
So respect her, I'll pay up for the time used  
And then she runs to the pastor  
And he tells her there will be a new chapter  
But she feels no different after  
And then she asks him  
Where my money at?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Some live for the bill  
Some kill for the bill  
(Yeah, where my money at?)  
She wined for the bill  
Grind for the bill  
(Whoa, where my money at?)  
Some steal for the bill, if they got to pay the bill  
(Yeah, where my money at?)  
Tonight Wyclef, Akon, Weezy on the bill  
(Whoa) Where my money at?

If you could see them  
The bullet riddle brothers you thought were brave  
The thugs, the gangstas  
If you could hear them right now as they knock on heaven's door  
They would tell you straight up  
Stop the sh-t  
The shootin, the bangin  
Too many tears  
Too many wakes  
Too many twenty-five to lifes  
And wake up  
They're up there right now talkin to you in tongues of fire  
For the love of life  
Stop it  
Yo, if you don't stop, I'm gonna get you before you get yourself  
This has been Philipe Luciano broadcasting live on Hot 93.1 Masquerade  
Holla

One, two...  
One, two-One,two...  
Yo!  
  
Hey yo! The Streets Are Like A Jungle  
I'm countin' money in the jungle  
Hey yo! The Streets Are Like A jungle  
Guns go off in the jungle  
  
I tip my derby like Zorro  
Ain't no such things as war heroes  
Frontline planes fly by, like the sparrow (BLAOW!)  
My face hits the dirt, flashbacks of Vietnam  
Remind me of the L.A. riots, when it was on  
Fire hits the street, neon lights are bright  
My tank cuts the corner, enemies take flight (That's right!)  
Make no mistake, you can't have this cake it took too long to bake  
and you can't carry this weight, so move on  
These are the words of the elders  
Babysitters got caught with cocaine in a baby's diapers  
Explain that, in the form of a rap  
She got caught with vals, A-CRACK-A-LACK-A-LACK!!!  
Now I'm upset, I get back to the projects  
First one I blast was a usual suspect, a fiend  
In the alley, named Ricky  
Talked to a Det. rookie, gave him the info  
About the paliquo, and where he gotta go  
All he want in return is a Sony stereo  
  
Hey yo! The Streets Are Like A Jungle  
I'm countin' money in the jungle  
Hey yo! The Streets Are Like A jungle  
Guns go off in the jungle  
  
Hey yo my mind is my business so I'm...  
Minding my own, in the club 'til this girl said,  
"Let me see your telephone"  
I passed her my celly  
She called her girl Mary  
And said that she just broke up with her nigga out in D.C.  
She needs a new honey, in the city she gets lonely  
I finally figured out her man's locked up in a penatentary  
So tell me, what should I do when she gets off the phone?  
The devil said, "Clef, take her ass home!"  
God says, "Repect her, her man's in the pen"  
This kid pushed me from behind, "Yo, why you fuckin' with my woman?!!!"  
Then his girl looked at me, she winked! I blinked!  
Now he's coming up to me with the gorilla instinct  
Aww, cool-n-shit! I'm sittin' here eatin' shrimp  
Besides, I would hate for you to be a missing link  
He said, "Son, do you know who I am?! I'm no man, but one man  
who? The son of Sam!"  
I said you've got this wrong, I never sung your girl a love song  
He drew for his weapon, there's no more conversation  
Cock!Cock!Cock!Cock!Cock!Cock! He released!  
then breathe, His aim went off balance  
The music got tense  
That's when I knew I was in trouble! The street is like a jungle!  
I jumped behind the bar, but caught two in the ankle! POW! (Echo)

You knew we had to come back like this, right man  
It's too hot in New York man, yeah  
It's too hot in New York man, give me  
  
Three nights in Rio De Janeiro with no sounds of buses  
No ambulance, no police sirens to interrupt my silence, aha ? dinero  
Means I work hard and have a warm day  
Playin' my guitar, I'm sitting on the beach  
I'm sippin' margaritas as the water splash my feet  
It's too hot in New York I had to get away  
So here's a ticket, meet me on the beach in the shade  
  
When I was young they called me Robin Hood  
'Cause I stole from the rich and I gave to the poor  
Went back home, mama whooped on my ass  
Said I'll be damned if I let you live like that  
Meanwhile next door neighbors jumpin'  
Beatin' on his wife while the kids were watchin'  
Later that day we was out on the porch  
And fantasize we was out of New York, we woke up in  
  
Three nights in Rio De Janeiro with no sounds of buses  
No ambulance, no police sirens to interrupt my silence, aha ? dinero  
Means I work hard and have a warm day  
Playin' my guitar, I'm sitting on the beach  
I'm sippin' margaritas as the water splash my feet  
It's too hot in New York I had to get away  
So here's a ticket, meet me on the beach in the shade  
  
I'm in your hood like your neighbors were Spiderman  
I'm in the club 'fore I entered the stadium  
I bring the vibe like the days of the Tribe  
Before I had the fame I was servin' the fries  
So who better to know about a nine-to-five  
Wakin' up at five with the cold in my eyes  
Now my daddy, he can rest in peace  
From the belly of the beast to the sunniest beach, let's go  
  
Three nights in Rio De Janeiro with no sounds of buses  
No ambulance, no police sirens to interrupt my silence, aha ? dinero  
Means I work hard and have a warm day  
  
Playin' my guitar, used to daydream at the stars  
Prayin' if I ever make it, I'm gon' help my family make it  
From the streets of Brooklyn, to the Jersey ? ?  
I'm a stand on stage and play this guitar till I fall  
Santana, let me get some help  
Santana, let me get some help  
  
Eh, this one goes out to those who work, follow and ?  
Keep your head up, 'cause if I made it, you can make it too one day  
  
Three nights in Rio De Janeiro with no sounds of buses  
No ambulance, no police sirens to interrupt my silence, aha ? dinero  
Means I work hard and have a warm day  
Playin' my guitar, I'm sitting on the beach  
I'm sippin' margaritas as the water splash my feet  
It's too hot in New York I had to get away  
So here's a ticket, meet me on the beach in the shade  
  
It's too hot in New York man  
It's too hot in New York man, ah  
It's too hot in New York man  
It's too hot, hey  
It's too hot in New York man, whoa  
It's too hot in New York man  
It's too hot in New York man  
It's too hot, hey  
  
Yeah, Carlos Santana with the Preacher's son  
It's the world tour, too hot  
y'all know better, let's go now  
  
Guantanamera, Celia will always love ya  
Guantanamera, Clef with the Carlos Santana  
Guantanamera, Celia will always miss ya  
Guantanamera, Clef with the Carlos Santana, haha, haha

Light is in the air right now  
Two thousand and two rebel music  
The saga continues  
Listen, children  
  
What's the problem in Manhattan  
Every ten men they look like Bin Laden  
So I have problems when I go to the airport  
First thing they do they want to ask me for my passport  
The said Wyclef we love the Fugees the score  
But did anybody give you any strange package to bring on board  
I was like 'no'  
Here comes your national guards  
This look like a scene from the movie Star Wars  
One foot in, one foot out standing in the airplane  
I'm on tour  
I'm on my way to Japan  
First class, dark shades  
Let the fuschia out bed  
I want to sleep but keep my eyes on the cock pit  
Why just think they stay target- the pilot  
We gonna take over the plane  
Like the Los Angeles riot  
  
Riot  
Riot  
The Middle East  
The Middle East  
The street pack more heat than the Middle East  
The Middle East  
The Middle East  
When will the violence sleep in the Middle East  
The Middle East  
The street pack more heat than the Middle East  
The Middle East  
The Middle East  
When will the violence  
Say peace  
Say peace  
  
We don't want no war no more  
Let me hear the streets  
Peace, oh peace  
We don't want no war no more  
Let me hear the Middle East now  
Peace, now peace, oh peace, oh peace  
We don't want no war no more  
Let me hear the USA say peace  
Say peace  
Lord, peace  
We don't want no war no more  
We don't want no war no more  
We don't want no war no more  
We don't want no war no more  
We don't want no war no more  
We don't want no war no more  
We don't want no war no more  
Ay, peace  
Oh peace  
We don't want no war no more  
No, no let me hear you say  
Peace, peace,  
Say peace, say peace  
We don't want no war no more  
No, no, no, no  
Say peace, oh peace  
We don't want no war no more  
No more riots  
Riots

I want to apologize for makin you wait so long for the sequel  
Wyclef, Mary J., this one called 'What About the Baby'  
You ever been like  
  
[Wyclef]  
Let me talk to my daughter  
Daughter this is your poppa  
I know it's been a while  
We haven't talked  
  
[Mary J. Blige]  
But daddy you've been gone  
And me and mom have been all alone  
It's been a struggle and you weren't there for us  
He say  
  
[Wyclef Jean]  
Okay, when I called you  
She wouldn't put you on the phone  
She call the police, restrainin order  
50 feet, from my home  
I tried, I ain't lyin  
It's so sad that the heavens cryin, AYY!  
Once a boy and twice a man  
I'm just tryin to do the best I can  
Give me a chance girl  
  
[Chorus: Wyclef]  
A grown man ain't supposed to cry  
So why does water fill my eyes when I hear your voice  
Everything gon' be alright  
Baby girl I'm by your side, dry your eyes  
  
[Mary J. Blige]  
Let's talk this over  
Now see I heard everything that you told her  
But it's gon' take more than words  
For you to be a father, uh-huh  
Responsibilities of a man  
Like stayin faithful just for the fam'  
What if she knew that you chose  
Another over her mother, aowwww!  
So you called her  
And I wouldn't put her on the phone  
I called the police yes, restrainin order  
50 feet, from my home  
I tried, I ain't lyin  
It's so sad that the heavens are cryin, yeahhh  
Once a girl, twice of a man  
And I'ma try to do the best I can  
I can't give you a chance noooo  
  
[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]  
A woman ain't supposed to cry  
So why don't you just wipe your eyes, dry your eyes  
You've learned a house is not a home  
When you're living all alone, and you want back home  
  
[Wyclef]  
Wait a minute girl! You're my joy, happiness that you bring  
Turn the fall back to spring girl, you're my bling  
You a hip-hop song I heard for the first time time  
Studied all the words to the rhyme  
You're my life, without you there's no sun, there's no moon  
There's no stars, shinin in the ni-iight  
  
[Mary J. Blige]  
But if I give you a chance, would you show me you care  
Be a man, no matter what the circumstances  
Ahhhow!  
  
[Wyclef]  
A grown man ain't supposed to cry  
So why does water fill my eyes when I hear your voice  
[Blige]  
You've learned a house is not a home  
When you're living all alone, and you want back home  
  
[Chorus: Wyclef]  
A grown man ain't supposed to cry  
So why does water fill my eyes when I hear your voice  
(What about the baby! What about the baby!)  
Everything gon' be alright  
Baby girl I'm by your side, I apologize!  
I cry, and I cry, I cry

  
  
  
  
Wyclef:  
  
Hello, boys and girls.  
  
Welcome, to Wyclef Words of Wisdom.  
  
Have you ever been sitting in your  
  
house at two o'clock in the morning  
  
and you get a mysterious phone  
  
call from a girl that you don't know? (A female begins talking sexy)  
  
Now, hold on, think with your mind  
  
and not with your pistol.  
  
Cause if you invite her over  
  
this is what might happen:  
  
  
Rape! Rape!  
  
Rape! Rape!  
  
Rape! Rape! (What the... Yo, yo, yo...shit!)  
  
Rape! Rape!  
  
Rape! Rape!  
  
Rape! Rape!  
  
  
Cop: Freeze! Put your hands in the air!  
  
Wyclef: Officer, you don't understand.  
  
She called me. I was sleeping.  
  
I was minding my business.  
  
Cop: I don't give a flying fuck  
  
about two bits about a piss.  
  
You're fuckin' guilty. (Yes, yes)  
  
Wyclef: Nobody's protected.  
  

  
  
  
  
Wyclef (echo):  
  
Yo, yo, I want to give a shout-out  
  
to the world.  
  
This is Wyclef, cold-chillin'  
  
out here with my pina-colada.  
  
Yeah, baby.  
  
I'm in the islands, cold relaxin'.  
  
Right about now the carnival's  
  
gonna change phases.  
  
If you got your ticket, man,  
  
you're allowed to come with me.  
  
Yo, for right now I'm gonna  
  
chill in the beach,  
  
check out the pretty girls  
  
layin' back.  
  
You know how we do, playa yo.  
  
I'm out here in the sun, baby,  
  
it's all good!  
  

Josie's on a vacation far away  
Come around and talk it over  
So many things that I'd like to say  
You know I like my girls a little bit older  
I just want to use your love tonight  
I don't want to lose your love tonight  
  
I ain't got many friends left to talk to  
No-one's around when I'm in trouble  
You know I'd do anything for you  
Stay the night - we'll keep it under cover  
  
I just want to use your love tonight  
I don't want to lose your love tonight  
  
Try to stop my hands from shakin'  
Somethin' in my mind's not makin' sense  
It's been awhile since we've been all alone  
I can't hide the way I'm feelin'  
  
As you leave me please would you close the door  
and forget what I told you  
Just 'cause you're right - that don't mean I'm wrong  
Another shoulder to cry upon  
  
I just want to use your love tonight  
I don't want to lose your love tonight  
Yeah  
I just want to use your love tonight  
I don't want to lose your love tonight  
Lose your love  
Lose your love  
Lose your love
