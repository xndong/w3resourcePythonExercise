It cuts both ways  
Our love is like knife that cuts both ways  
It's driven deep into my heart each time  
That I realize  
How it cuts both ways  
Can't be together, cannot live apart  
We're heading straight into a broken heart  
But I can't stop  
'Cause I feel too much to let you go  
I'm hurting you and it's hard I know  
To stay and fight for what we've got  
Knowing it'll never be good enough  
'Cause you and I are dangerous  
We want too much and life ain't that way  
Don't ask for more, you'd be a fool  
Haven't we already broken every rule?  
It cuts both ways  
We're in too deep for sorry alibis  
Can't have regrets or even question why  
We can't say goodbye  
Because it cuts both ways  
No more illusions of the love we make  
No sacrifice would ever be too great  
If you would just stay  
'Cause I feel too much to let you go  
I'm hurting you and it's hard I know  
To stay and fight for what we've got  
Knowing it'll never be good enough  
'Cause you and I are dangerous  
We want too much and life ain't that way  
Don't ask for more, don't be a fool  
Haven't we already broken every rule?  
Cuts both ways  
Our love is like a knife that cuts both ways  
It's drivin' deep into my heart each time  
I see we livin' the lie  
And it cuts both ways  
It cuts both ways  
Cuts both ways  
Cuts both ways  

I know I let you in  
I let down my defenses momentarily  
At this moment of my life to be surprised  
With feelings I can never satisfy  
The words you wrote would free  
My carefully protected vulnerability  
Doesn't matter that both wear a disguise  
We can read the truth between the lines  
Dangerous game  
Who's spared when it's over tomorrow  
I'd be a fool to keep this alive  
When I know this can't go anywhere  
You know you let me in  
You lost your self control to curiosity  
Took the bait, I should have never lit the spark  
Answering your questions in the dark  
Dangerous game  
Who's spared when it's over tomorrow  
I'd be a fool to keep this alive  
When I know this can't go anywhere  
Who's the one to blame when things begin to fall apart  
Never mind I should have known much better than to even start  
How did you make it over all the walls I build so high  
Believing all you had to do was try  
Dangerous game  
Who's spared when it's over tomorrow  
I'd be a fool to keep this alive  
When I know this can't go anywhere  

Destiny  
Has once again surprised me  
Oh destiny  
Must want you here beside me  
Quietly  
Like the sunrise with its splendor  
Unexpectedly  
With a passion strong yet tneder  
You draw me in  
Lke the moon draws the tide  
Swept away by this love  
Taken in by your eyes  
If I had to walk away from you  
I know that it would be no use  
'Cause you're so deep inside of me  
Can't deny  
I never want to be set free  
The more you give the more I need  
You can't change what is meant to be  
No you can't change destiny  
Destiny  
Destiny  
Speakd with many voices  
So eventually  
We're obliged to make some choices  
Oh destiny  
Who I thought I owned completely  
Just to toy with me  
Made me fall in love so deeply  
You fill my soul  
Like the sears fill the sky  
Brought to life  
This nnew world  
Where I'm held captive inside  
If I had to walk away from you  
I know that it would be no use  
'Cause you're so deep inside of me  
Can't deny  
I never want to be set free  
The more you give the more I need  
You can't change what is meant to be  
No, you can't change destiny  
If I had to walk away from you  
I know that it would be no use  
No you can't change destiny  
Destiny  
Destiny  
Destiny...  

Embrace me, my sweet embraceable you  
Embrace me, you irreplaceable you  
  
Just one look at you  
My heart grew tipsy in me  
You and you alone  
Bring out the Gypsy in me  
  
I love all the many charms about you  
Above all, I want my arms about you  
  
Don't be a naughty baby  
Come to mama, come to mama do  
My sweet embraceable you  
  
I love all the many charms about you  
Above all, I want my arms about you  
  
Don't be a naughty baby  
Come to mama, come to mama do  
My sweet embraceable you

What in this world, feels so alive  
Makes us, then breaks us, then helps us survive  
Buries our hopes, then revives our desire to succeed  
We're all greed  
Who in this world sees when I cry  
Throws me, then shows me that I'm justified  
Measure my worth, then decide that I'm not what they need  
They've agreed  
Where in this world can I hide?  
Where can I find someone  
That sees me inside to confide  
How in this world can I go on  
Wondering if you'll think of me when I'm gone?  
Shielding my eyes from the pitiless light of the glare  
Should you care?  
When in this world is it enough?  
I never thought it could be quite this rough  
Living my life as if millions of people don't stare  
They're not there  
Why should I have to defend or derive  
Most of the rules of the game, I've defied  
Though it's been hard on my pride  
It's been one hell of a ride  
Curiously  
I didn't set out to be famous  

You say I know it's a waste of time  
There's no use trying  
So scared that life's gonna pass you by  
Your spirit dying  
Not long ago  
I could feel your strength and your devotion  
What was so clear, is now overcast  
With mixed emotions  
Deep in your heart is the answer  
Find it, I know it will pull you through  
  
Get on your feet  
Get up and make it happen  
Get on your feet  
Stand up and take some action  
  
I think it's true that we've all been through  
Some nasty weather  
Let's understand that we're here  
To handle things together  
You gotta keep looking onto tomorrow  
There's so much in life  
That's meant for you  
  
Get on your feet  
Get up and make it happen  
Get on your feet  
Stand up and take some action  
Get on your feet  
Don't stop before it's over  
Get on your feet  
The weight is off your shoulder  
  
Get up and make it happen  
Stand up, stand up, stand up and take some action  
Gotta get on your feet, yeah, yeah  
Don't stop before it's over  
Get on your feet  
The weight is off your shoulder  
Get on your feet  
Get up, get up, get up and make it happen  
Get on your feet  
Stand up , stand up and take some action  
Get on your feet

There's no wrong and no right  
In the heat of the night you stop thinking  
You don't care anymore  
Throw all doubt out the door  
And you let go  
  
You may try to fight back by ignoring the fact  
That you want it  
But it's harder each day  
No more games you can play to avoid it  
  
You may think you're cool and collected  
Obeying all the rules  
  
But when someone's blinding your senses  
You give it up and fall in love  
  
Feel your heart beating fast  
Want this moment to last you forever  
Feel your throat getting dry  
When you find that it's now or it's never  
Since you're feeling confused  
You no longer can choose and you weaken  
Then you finally give in to this urge from within  
And it happens  
  
You may think you're cool and collected  
Obeying all the rules  
But when someone's driving you crazy  
You give it up and fall in love  
Fall in love  
  
You're gonna fall in love  
  
Fall in love  

Touche, touche  
You're right, there's nothin' I can say  
I am a wishy, washy girl  
But it's a wishy, washy world  
  
Go away  
No, wait a minute  
I want out  
Then I want in it  
I'm all confused but I admit it  
Go away  
No, wait a minute  
  
Ces la vie, la vie  
That's what you get when you get me  
Have the right to change my mind  
At least a couple hundred times  
  
Go away  
No, wait a minute  
I want out  
Then I want in it  
I'm all confused but I admit it  
Go away  
No, wait a minute  
  
I need some help  
I'm not quite myself  
And lately I'm a nervous wreck  
My whole world has changed  
And the reason I'm strange  
Is I love you and baby that scares me to death  
  
Go away  
No, wait a minute  
I want out  
Then I want in it  
I'm all confused but I admit it  
Go away  
No, wait a minute  
  
I'm all confused but I admit it  
Go away  
No, wait a minute  

Your name, your name  
Your name, your name  
Your name, your name  
Hey there baby are you feelin' down?  
'Cause you've got nobody's arms  
To wrap your arms around  
Are you thinking what you're looking for  
Just can't be found  
If a part time heart is what you need  
What you want now baby  
You won't get from me  
If sometime love you're looking for  
Darlin' don't be knockin' on my door  
If you need someone  
To stand there beside you  
If you want love that's true

I got love I got love I got love for you

Love is waiting in these arms of mine  
If you're looking for a love that's the forever kind  
Baby you don't have to look no more  
Look in my eyes  
If you want somebody you can hold  
I'll be the one who'll never let you go  
If you want somebody who will stay  
I'll be the one who'll never walk away  
If you need someone  
To stand there beside you  
Nothin' less is gonna do  
I got a heart with your name on it, name on it  
I got love, I got love, I got love for you  
I got a heart put your claim on it, claim on it  
This heart will, this heart will beat for you  
If you want it to  
If you want it to  
Oh baby  
Oh I love to give you love

Part time heart is what you need  
What you want now baby

Full time love is on your mind

I got love, I got a love  
I got a happy, I got a happy  
I got a happy  

Baby, it's nothing that you've said  
But I know it's not just in my head  
You're changing, baby, and you don't think I see  
I feel you drifting away, a little bit further every day  
Don't tell me, baby, don't tell me it's just me  
I see it in the look that's on your face  
Something's not the same inside  
You can't keep it from me, no matter how you try  
'Cause I know you too well, for you to ever think  
You could tell me a lie, yes, I know you too well  
No one knows you like I do and it's so easy to tell  
When you look away, there's something you're hiding  
I know you too well, too well  
Maybe the timing isn't right  
Maybe I see the end in sight  
Is it over baby, is it hurting you to stay?  
Maybe you don't know what to do  
You can't find a way to break the news  
Think it over, baby, it hurts me more this way  
I'd rather have you tell me to my face  
Than tell me every thing's all right  
What you don't wanna say is there in black and white  
'Cause I know you too well, for you to ever think  
You could tell me a lie, yes, I know you too well  
No one knows you like I do and it's so easy to tell  
When you look away, there's something you're hiding  
I know you, too well, too well  
I'd rather have you tell me to my face  
Than tell me every thing's all right  
What you don't wanna say is there in black and white  
'Cause I know you too well, for you to ever think  
You could tell me a lie, yes, I know you too well  
No one knows you like I do and it's so easy to tell  
When you look away, there's something you're hiding  
I know you, too well, too well, know you  
'Cause I know you too well, for you to ever think  
You could tell me a lie, yes, I know you too well  
No one knows you like I do and it's so easy to tell  
When you look away, there's something you're hiding  
I know you, too well, too well  

I've been waiting for somebody  
To satisfy my needs  
Someone who will be my lover  
Someone that I can please  
I just don't know where to find him  
I don't know where to go  
All I know is this urge inside me will  
Drive me up the wall  
  
I need a man who will love me  
I need a man that I can make love to  
I need a man who will please me  
My whole life long  
  
I'm not waiting any longer  
I'm running out of time  
You can't spend your whole live dancing  
You've got to have some fun  
My body is screaming for some action  
Don't you understand  
Tonight I need someone to love me  
Tonight I need a man  
  
I need a man  
Who will love me  
I need a man  
That I can make love to  
I need a man  
Who will please me  
My whole life long  
I need a man  
  
I want a guy that I can call my own  
A boy who's kisses get me out of control  
A guy to kiss me everything that I need  
You've gotta find him, I'm beggin' ya please  
I need a, I need a, I need a, I need, I need,  
I need a man  
Come on, I want you, I want you,  
I've got to have you  
I want a guy that I can call my own  
A guy to kiss me everything that I need  
Come one, I want you, I need you  
I've got to have you  
I want a guy that I can call my own

Something deep inside of me  
Keeps holding on to your memory  
How I've tried to find someone new  
But everywhere I look it's you that I see  
Don't you know that my whole life has changed  
I can't look at the past without feeling the pain  
And at night all alone I just cry  
And I hope, and I pray you'll be  
Back by my side  
  
I need your love  
Every day seems forever without you  
I need your love  
Tell me that you'll come back to me  
All my friends tell me  
I'll be ok  
That someday i'll forget you  
And i'll love once again  
  
But someday seems so far away  
And I know I won't make it without you in the end  
Tell me how can I go on this way  
Knowing that someone else could be  
Taking my place  
Tell me where in the world would I be  
If I wake up each morning and you're not here with me  
  
I need your love  
Everyday seems forever without you  
I need your love  
Tell me that you'll come back to me  
I need your love  
Every day seems forever without you  
I need your love  
Tell me that you'll come back to me  
I need your love  
Every day seems forever without you  
I need your love  
Tell me that you'll come back to love me

I get a little tongue twisted  
Every time I talk to you when I see you  
And I'm so glad that you just missed it  
The way I stared to memorize your face  
To kiss you in my mind  
Love you all the time  
'Cause when I close my eyes  
I still can see your smile  
It's bright enough to light my life  
Out of my darkest hour  
Please believe it's true  
When I tell you I love you  
I've taken too many chances  
Searching for the truth in love that's in my heart  
Tell me if I made the wrong advances  
Tell me if I've made you feel ashamed  
'Cause I know I have to do this  
Would you hold my hand right through it?  
'Cause when I close my eyes  
I still can see your smile  
It's bright enough to light my life  
Out of my darkest hour  
Please believe it's true  
When I tell you I love you  
I had to let you know just what would happen  
Yes I had to let you know the truth  
I know I've got to do this  
Would you hold my hand right through it? Would you?  
'Cause when I close my eyes  
I still can see your smile  
It's bright enough to light my life  
Out of my darkest hour  
'Cause when I close my eyes  
I still can see your smile  
It's bright enough to light my life  
Out of my darkest hour  
You know now this is true  
When I tell you I love you  

You're the only one to make me tremble  
The one to show me how to laugh and cry  
In your arms I feel complete surrender  
Why baby why  
To feel no need for lies or alibis  
  
(I want you so bad)  
Ooh baby  
I really, really want you  
(What should we do)  
What should we do  
You know I want you  
Should I stay, should I go  
I really don't know  
I'm so scared, I'm afraid  
I can't find a way  
To say I love you  
  
No one's ever touched me like you've touched me  
I swear that's no lie  
I never thought I'd feel like this inside  
Can't control this feeling deep within me  
I can't keep inside  
Yet I can't seem to let it go, oh no  
  
(I want you so bad)  
Ooh baby  
I really, really want you  
(What should we do)  
What should we do  
You know I want you  
(I want you so bad)  
(What should we do)  
Ooh baby, baby  
I really, really, really want you

So many songs talk about love  
Written by those who never  
Felt it's touch  
And then there are lines  
With poetry rhyme  
By those who have known but  
Never said much  
And here I am  
Trying to get you make into my world  
Trying to get that feeling known to you  
If I could only find the words  
Typical lines  
Usual games  
I new what to say then  
  
To get my own way  
I knew it was wrong  
I acted untrue  
But I would trade forever  
For a yesterday with you  
And here I am trying to get  
You back into my world  
Trying to get that feeling known to you  
If I could only find the words  
If I could only find the words  
I knew it was wrong  
I acted untrue  
But I would trade forever  
For a yesterday with you  
La la la la la  
La la la la la  
La la la la la  
If I could only find the words

One day soon, it's gonna happen just by chance  
You and I will just succumb to this romance  
On that day my love will find you  
And you'll discover what a wonder life can be  
And you will know how much I love you  
If we were lovers  
If we were more than just good friends  
I know how good it could be  
Just by the way you're looking at me  
As if we were lovers, if we were lovers  
I've waited so long for that day  
I think you feel the same way  
You try so hard not to give it away  
Afraid that I'll discover  
What in your heart you know, is meant to be  
Darlin' if you want it to be me  
To be the one to say, I want you  
Then I'm telling you now  
Gonna find a way somehow, to be your lover  
And spend the whole night making love  
Then find it's never enough  
Just think what we are giving up  
Every day that we're not lovers  
Few times in our lives can we feel this way  
It would be a shame just to throw it away  
Time is slipping by, we don't know what's ahead  
I don't want to look back and have any regrets  
One day soon, it's gonna happen just by chance  
You and I will just succumb to this romance  
On that day my love will find you  
And you'll discover what a wonder life can be  
And you will know how much I love you  
On that day my love will find you  
And you'll discover what a wonder life can be  
And you will know how much I love you  
How much I love you  

To be completely honest  
It scares me to imagine  
What life would be without you  
  
And for this very reason  
I ask you to forgive me  
For what I'm putting us through  
  
Although there are so many things  
Against us, I've decided  
That I'm not giving you up, no  
  
Thinking back, I see what we have  
Is something different  
I think we've known all along  
So how fair would it be  
To divide this love's existence  
Between what's right and what's wrong  
  
And you, always wondering if we'll make it  
Time will tell you  
That I'm not giving you up, no, no  
  
We'll find a way to be together  
However long it takes, wherever  
If it means having you for only a moment  
A moment just might be enough  
I'm not giving you up, no  
No I'm not giving you up, no  
  
Screaming in the silence the promises we've spoken  
Come back to haunt me, false and broken  
Quiet desperation to see we're lost forever  
Searching for water in the desert  
  
No, I refuse to have to do  
Without your kisses  
I'm not giving you up, no, no  
  
We'll find a way to be together  
However long it takes, wherever  
If it means having you for only a moment  
A moment just might be enough  
I'm not giving you up, no  
  
No I'm not giving you up, no  
No I'm not giving you up

I've grown accustomed to his face  
He almost makes the day begin  
I've grown accustomed  
To the tune that he whistles night and noon  
  
His smiles, his frowns  
His ups, his downs  
Are second nature to me now  
Like breathing out and breathing in  
  
I was serenely independent  
And content before we met  
Surely I could always be that way again  
And yet, I've grown accustomed to his look  
  
Accustomed to his voice  
Accustomed to his face  
I'm so used to hearing him say  
"Good morning," every day  
  
His joys, his woes  
His highs, his lows  
Are second nature to me now  
Like breathing out and breathing in  
  
I'm very grateful he's a man and so easy to forget  
Rather like a habit one can always break  
And yet, I've grown accustomed  
To the trace of something in the air  
  
Accustomed to his face

Lookin' out for trouble, looking to succeed  
Tut, tu-ru ru, tut tut tu-ru-ru  
Set yourself free  
Baby loosen up your tie  
Papu mao mao, papu mao mao mao  
Ooh let it loose  
Ooh let it loose  
Breakdown in the tempo  
Cold sweat constantly  
Play the radio loud and get lost in the beat  
Come on baby let it slide  
Papu mao mao, papu mao mao mao  
Ooh let it loose  
Ooh let it loose  
Rock n'roll in danger from machinery  
Tut, tu-ru-ru, tut tut tu-ru-ru  
Sing it with me  
Tut, tu-ru-ru, tut tut tu-ru-ru  
Tut, tu-ru-ru, tut tut tu-ru-ru hey  
Tut, tu-ru-ru, tut tut tu-ru-ru  
Tut, tu-ru-ru, tut tut tu-ru-ru  
One more time with lots o' soul  
Almost till ya lose control  

Oh! the weather outside is frightful  
But the fire is so delightful  
And since we've no place to go  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
  
No it doesn't show signs of stopping  
And I brought some corn for popping  
The lights are turned way down low  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
  
When we finally kiss goodnight  
How I'll hate going out in the storm  
But if you'll really hold me tight  
All the way home I'll be warm  
  
The fire is slowly dying  
And my dear we're still goodbye-ing  
But as long as you love me so  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
  
When we finally kiss goodnight  
How I'll hate going out in the storm  
But if you'll really hold me tight  
All the way home I'll be warm  
  
The fire is slowly dying  
And my dear we're still goodbye-ing  
But as long as you love me so  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
  
Let it snow, let it snow  
Let it snow, let it snow  
One more time  
Let it snow, let it snow  
Let it snow, let it snow

(After Love Is Gone)  
  
? Saying what's on your mind  
Don't hold back think if it would be kind  
Life goes on and on after love is gone  
Don't bother now with apologise  
No tear full of?, no sad memories  
Life goes on and on after love is gone  
I never knew you although I tried  
You always kept your feelings inside  
All I needed was someone to confide,  
Someone to be always by my side  
  
No painful sins, no? Guys  
No world full of excuses, no planed alibies  
Life goes on and on after love is gone  
I never knew you although I tried  
You always kept your feelings inside  
All I needed was someone to confide,  
Someone to be always by my side  
No? ? To?  
When love is alive it's not worth the while  
Life goes on and on after love is gone  
Life goes on and on (after love is gone)  
  
Life goes on and on (after love is gone)  
Life goes on and on (after love is gone)  
Life goes on and on (after love is gone)  
Life goes on and on (after love is gone)

When you turned and walked away  
You said all you had to say  
It was over  
You just couldn't understand  
How deeply I had given all my love to you  
I was left alone in tears  
Our life together had become a memory  
And as far as I can see  
There was darkness  
And I had nothing left inside but pain and sorrow  
I had no plans for my tomorrow  
And I had to find a reason  
That would make me live again  
Live again  
  
Now today  
I feel my life is worth living  
I have someone who is giving  
Someone to share each new day  
Someone who will always stay  
When I think of yesterday  
It all seems so far away  
I'm so happy  
And I feel as my life has just begun  
And that the world is gonna be mine  
It is this feeling deep inside me  
That has made me live again  
Live again  
Live again

Oh, la,la,la,la,la,la,la, la,la,la,la,la,la  
Lying awake I turn to you as you are softly sleeping  
I think of what I'd like to do while you are somewhere dreaming  
I,I feel so happy by your side,oh why,I  
wonder,wonder,wonder why  
Find it hard to find the words to say what  
I am feeling  
I'm so in love I'm so alive and I know you're the reason why  
Why I'm so crazy(happy) all the time, oh why,  
I wonder,wonder,wonder why  
  
I need nothing else in life than to hold you  
I,oh I am in so deep, I don't need no sleep  
Just baby you and me  
  
Baby I live for loving you,oh,la,la,la,la...  
Live for loving you,all I want to do is love you,  
love you  
  
It would never cross my mind to find  
another lover  
'Cause after having been with you,there could  
never be no other  
I,just touching you I'm satisfied,oh why,  
I wonder,wonder,wonder why

I can't go on this way forever  
Closing my eyes and just imagining  
I'm loving you  
When i'm close to you it feels so right  
Can't sleep at night  
But if i try to stay away can't even  
Make it through the day  
No longer care if it is wrong or right  
I wanna love you, baby, through the night  
Till the morning light  
Can't stop imagining the tenderness of your caress  
Couldn't stop if i wanted to  
There's nothing left for me to do  
  
Please, love me  
Just look into my eyes  
I know you want me  
Say what you feel inside  
Don't be afraid to try  
I'm yours if you say  
Please, love me  
If it's so hard to say then baby, touch me  
I can't take it anymore  
I'm dizzy with your love  
I'm yours if you say baby, stay  
  
You drive me crazy when you look at me  
I'm nearly blinded by my fantasy  
You're making love to me  
If i can't have you  
Don't know what i'll do  
I'm so in love with you  
I'll play any game you wanna play  
But i just wanna hear you say  
  
Please, love me just look into my eyes  
I know you want me  
Say what you feel inside  
Don't be afraid to try  
I'm yours if you say  
Please, love me if it's so hard to say  
Then baby, touch me  
I can't take it anymore  
I'm dizzy with your love  
I'm yours if you say baby, stay  
I'm yours if you say baby, stay

I found love on a two way street  
Lost it on a lonely highway  
Love on a two way street  
Lost it on a lonely highway  
True love will never die  
So I've been told, but now I must cry  
It is finally goodbye, I know  
With the music softly playing  
His lips were gently saying  
I love you  
He held me in desperation  
I thought it was a revelation  
And then he walked out  
How could I be so blind  
To give up love the very first time  
To be fooled is a hurting pain  
To be loved and fooled  
Is a crying shame  
While I bear the blame  
As he laughs my name  
With the music softly playing  
His lips were gently saying  
Honey, I love you  
He held me in desperation  
I thought it was a revelation  
And then he walked out  
I found love on a two way street  
Lost it on a lonely highway  
Love on a two way street  
Lost it on a lonely highway  
I found love on a two way street  
Lost it on a lonely highway  
Love on a two way street  
Lost it on a lonely highway  

If I could only have one wish this holiday  
Without a second thought I'd have to say  
That you can't find what I want in any store  
I just want you to be mine and nothing more  
No brand new clothes could fill my lonely soul  
When the snow falls on the ground and it gets cold  
No expensive gift you put under my tree  
Will keep me warm this holiday if you're not holding me  
I don't want diamond rings, perfume or brand new shoes  
Baby all I want for Christmas is you  
  
Santa bring, on your sleigh, just for me this holiday  
The one I want and make my dreams come true  
I'll be good every day, I'll put some love on layaway  
And spend it all this Christmas on you  
La la la la la la la la la la lay  
Gonna put some love on layaway for you  
La la la la la la la la la la lay  
Gonna spend it all this Christmas on you  
  
If I could win your heart and show you how I feel  
Ain't no way you're gonna find a better deal  
I've been saving all my loving for so long  
And after Christmas is over it still keeps going on  
Everyday would be like Christmas from now on  
Santa bring that love to me where it belongs  
  
Santa bring, on your sleigh, just for me this holiday  
The one I want and make my dreams come true  
I'll be good every day, I'll put some love on layaway  
And spend it all this Christmas on you  
La la la la la la la la la la lay

(Doo wop bop)  
When it comes to boys  
Mamma always said  
"Never let any temptation go to your head"  
(Doo wop bop)  
Oh, but it's so tempting so delicious

Besides I've got my reputation to maintain  
Must you be so darn persistent

Whispering those little secrets  
You really turn me on

Makes me wanna have more fun

Ok, well, what's it all about  
It's allright to change your mind  
But whenever you found what you must find  
Just remember, I'm holding on the line  
So take advice from an old friend  
To the heart you must be true  
While you're doing all the things you do  
Know that always, I'm in love with you  
  
And it's hard for me to stay away  
When my emotions so alive  
So I try to live just day to day  
Never knowing where love's leading us to  
Is there no end, is there no end  
For will our hearts join over and over again, again  
  
Sometimes I cannot understand what is going on inside  
Why you're always, always on my mind  
'cause forever is such a long, long time  
To awake, so may I make it clear  
Love is never win or lose  
It isn't something we can even choose  
When true passion has slowly lit the fuse  
  
And it's hard for me to stay away  
When my emotions's so alive  
So I try to live just day to day  
Never knowing where love's  
Leading us to  
Is there no end, is there no end  
For will our hearts join over and over again, again  
  
Ok, well, what's it all about  
It's allright to change your mind  
But whenever you found what you must find  
Just remember, I'm holding on the line  
So take advice from an old friend  
To the heart you must be true  
While you're doing all the things you do  
Know that always, I'm in love with you

Out of nowhere without a sign  
Never knowing what I would find  
Out of a dream into my life  
Must've done something right this time  
I don't know where all of this came from  
But I think I wanna get me some  
Did it happen when I looked away  
In just one day  
Suddenly you fell from up above  
And before I knew it, I found love  
Got lost on the way  
But I want to stay  
I just want to let you know tonight  
(All right)  
I can't sleep with all this on my mind  
Can you make it right  
Out of nowhere without a sign  
Never knowing what I would find  
Out of a dream into my life  
Must've done something right this time  
We can settle this in just one kiss  
Then we'll think of how to deal with this  
All the time it was in my best friend  
Didn't know it then  
But I'm ready for the consequence  
Didn't know this could be so intense  
Can't take it much longer  
This could change today  
I just want to let you know tonight  
(All right)  
I can't sleep with all this on my mind  
Can you make it right  
Out of nowhere without a sign  
Never knowing what I would find  
Out of a dream into my life  
Must've done something right this time  
I just want to let you know tonight  
(All right)  
I can't sleep with all this on my mind  
Out of nowhere without a sign  
Never knowing what I would find  
Out of a dream into my life  
Must've done something right this time  
Out of nowhere without a sign  
(Out of nowhere, I don't know where you came into my life)  
Out of a dream into my life  
(Baby, into my life, came into my life)  
Out of nowhere without a sign  
(You came into my life)  
Out of a dream into my life  
(Baby)  
Out of nowhere without a sign  
(Out of nowhere came into my life)  
Out of a dream into my life  

Love, love, love, love, love  
Say the word so very losely  
Where we come from is love, love, pure love  
And we're on our way back home  
  
And on that way, you never look back  
'Cause there's nothing there to see  
Just look around you  
There's always someone that's in need  
  
Of Maybe just kindness  
As we watch each other bleed  
From wounds we choose  
We never lose  
  
Love, love, love, love, love  
Misunderstood yet so desired  
We pay the cost for love, love, real love  
But we get back so much more, so much more  
  
So many questions  
Beginning to unfold  
I look for the answers  
In the middle of my soul  
  
I know you're out there  
And it's not like I've been told  
So I run to you  
I run to you  
  
To find the path of the right love  
Oh yeah the path of the right love  
We're on the path of the one love  
Oh yeah the path of the right love  
  
Love, love, love, love, love  
All around yet so elusive  
If we don't reach out for love, love, this love  
We're all just wasting time, precious time  
  
When in the long run  
What's meant to be will be  
Those things we ask for  
Become our destiny  
  
But while we're living  
Our souls can not be free  
Eventually, we will come to see  
To find the path of the right love, right love, right love  
  
Oh yeah the path of the right love  
We're on the path of the one love, yeah, yeah  
Oh yeah the path of the right love  
And that love, love, love, true love  
  
Must surely be good, must surely be kind  
And that love sweet love, strong love  
Is meant to be yours, is meant to be mine  
And I do believe if we share this life  
  
We must learn to share all it's pain and strife  
To find the path of the right love  
Oh yeah the path of the right love  
We're on the path of the one love  
  
Oh yeah the path of the right love  
To find the path of the right love  
Oh yeah the path of the right love  
We're on the path of the one love  
  
Oh yeah the path of the right love  
Aspire to your inevitable bliss  
And every grace will be given you

I've gotta run away from you  
If I wanna save myself  
And there's nothing I can do  
To break your magic spell  
You are evil and you show it  
With your eyes  
Oh, and the way your body moves  
Just keeps me hipnotized  
Cause I'm a prisoner of love  
Someone rescue me  
Release me from this state of mind  
I was born to be free  
Just a prisoner of love  
Come on let me be cause if loving you is my crime  
Go on and close the door on me  
  
Oh, I've been convicted for the crime  
I have been done  
But if losing you is my sentence  
I'd rather lose my life  
Can someone help me  
Help me keep my sanity  
Cause I love this evil force  
That's taking over me  
Cause I'm a prisoner of love  
Someone rescue me  
Release me from this state of mind  
I was born to be free  
Just a prisoner of love  
Come on let me be  
Cause if loving you is my crime  
Go on and close the door on me  
Cause I'm a prisoner of love  
Someone rescue me  
Release me from this state of mind  
I was born to be free  
Just a prisoner of love  
Come on let me be  
Cause if loving you is my crime  
Go on and close the door on me

One day you should go away  
I know you say you'll always stay  
Oh, but life takes funny turns at times  
And has a way of changing minds  
No, I could never be your friend

To me the end would be the end  
But we've shared so much happiness

Seems like everywhere I turn  
Somebody else is breakin' up
