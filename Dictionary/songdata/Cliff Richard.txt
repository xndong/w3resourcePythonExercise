Angel face  
We've just met  
Just how lucky can one boy get  
There's a light in your eye  
I know it's love and I know that I could be happy  
With a girl like you  
Tell your mom tell your pa  
And tell your favourite old wishing star  
We're in love, just by chance  
I asked you would like to dance  
Fancy dancing with a girl like you  
Funny how love can come to a lonely heart  
I'm a boy, you're a girl I guess that's a pretty start  
Here I am, there you are  
Together baby we should go far  
A girl like you, a boy like me  
Two hearts together like they ought to be  
Can't believe  
I've got a girl like  

I'm better off without you  
I'm better off you know  
We're nothing more than strangers  
With nowhere else to go  
But like a fool I'll stay by your side  
Knowing that you won't believe me  
When I say I've tried  
A heart will break tonight  
Make no mistake I'll lie awake tonight  
A heart will break and I won't feel the same  
'cause you stay just the same as you are  
And a heart will break tonight  
We made no commitment  
We made only words  
It's no consolation that we're free like the birds  
'cause who needs to fly like they do  
There's only one reason I'm staying  
It's 'cause I love you...i do  
A heart will break tonight  
Make no mistake I'll lie awake tonight  
A heart will break and I won't feel the same  
'cause you stay just the same as you are  
And a heart will break tonight  
A heart will break tonight  
Make no mistake I'll lie awake tonight  
A heart will break and I won't feel the same  
'cause you stay just the same as you are  
And a heart will break tonight  
Tonight it's gonna break  
Don't know if I'll make it  
Through' the night...oh oh oh oh...  

It's been so long  
You say you've had fun  
And you've been happy with the things you've done  
Now you feel strange and a little unreal  
Well I can understand the way you feel  
You're just a little in love  
(Just a little)  
You're just a little in love  
(Just a little)  
  
Well I can see what's happening to you  
You fell in love but it's just not true  
And there's one thing you ought to know  
I need you so I'm just a little in love  
(Just a little)  
I'm just a little in love  
(Just a little)  
  
You know sometimes you look somewhere  
You're not stone  
But there's no one there  
No one to turn to  
No one to see the way you're feeling  
A-just like me  
Just a little in love  
(Just a little)  
You're just a little in love  
(Just a little)  
  
You say you're willing to learn  
You need a friend  
A friend who will help you  
  
'cause you're just a little in love  
Oh yeah a little in love  
You are a little in love  
With someone you just like to see  
Like me, you're in love  
Oh yeah, a little in love  
You're in love

My heart was so heavy with longing for you  
My arms were so lonely, lonesome and blue  
Alone in my sorrow I heard a voice cry,  
A voice in the wilderness  
A voice from the sky.  
  
Have faith in your darling  
The voice seemed to say  
Be true to her memory  
She'll come back one day.  
And though there was no one  
Nobody to see,  
The voice in the wilderness brought comfort to me  
  
We had a quarrel,  
I was unkind  
Why did you leave me  
Love made me blind  
  
My darling forgive me  
I am for your touch  
Have pity come back now  
I need you so much  
  
Believe me and you'll hear it  
That voice from above  
The voice in the wilderness  
The voice of true love  
  
Believe me and you'll hear it  
That voice from above  
The voice in the wilderness  
The voice of true love

I'm lying alone with my head on the phone  
Thinking of you till it hurts  
I know you hurt too but what else can we do  
Tormented and torn apart  
I wish I could carry your smile and my heart  
For times when my life seems so low  
It would make me believe what tomorrow could bring  
When today doesn't really know.  
  
I'm all out of love, I'm so lost without you  
I know you were right believing for so long  
I'm all out of love, what am I without you  
I can't be too late to say that I was so wrong  
  
I want you to come back and carry me home  
Away from this long lonely nights  
I'm reaching for you, are you feeling it, too  
Does the feeling seem, oh, so right  
And what would you say if I called on you now  
And said that I just can't hold on  
There's no easy way, it gets harder each day  
Please, love me or I'll be gone  
  
'Cause I'm all out of love, I'm so lost without you  
And though you were right believing for so long  
I'm all out of love, what am I without you  
I can't be too late to say that I was so wrong, so wrong  
  
Oh, what are you thinking of?  
I'm thinking about you're gone  
What are you thinking of?  
How do we go so wrong?  
  
Ooh, I'm all out of love, I'm so lost without you  
I know you were right believing for so long  
I'm all out of love, what am I without you  
It can't be too late to say that I was so wrong  
  
Oh, here I'm all out of love,  
Nothing without you  
And I know it was so wrong, so wrong, so wrong.

The love in you and the love in me  
That's all that matters  
All the rest is just vanity  
That time will shatter  
The only treasure in the life we live  
Is in the measure of the love we give  
All that matters in the end will be  
The love in you and the love in me  
That's all that matters  
All that matters  
Every heart must change it's shape  
To fit the space that the lifetime makes  
Some regrets and some mistakes  
We touch happiness  
But we can't hold her  
Feelings come and disappear  
I've known the laughter  
I've cried those tears  
I should know better after all these years  
But I'm no wiser,  
I'm just older  
The love in you and the love in me  
That's all that matters  
All the rest is just vanity  
That time will shatter  
The only treasure in the life we live  
Is in the measure of the love we give  
All that matters in the end will be  
The love in you and the love in me  
Oh, oh  
That's all that matters  
All that matters  
Love is the treasure  
It's all the question of priority  
We've got so much  
That we just don't need  
If it ain't got nothing  
Then it's a luxury  
We can learn to live without it  
The love in you and the love in me  
Reprise

You say that I'll survive  
That I'll get over you  
But if you walk away that door  
Then what am I gonna 'do  
They say you don't appreciate love  
Until it's gone  
Well I guess I'll love you more  
Since I've known what was goin' on  
It's so easy to say  
That I'll miss you when you're gone  
But if this is the end  
Then the damage has been done  
Where did I go wrong  
  
How could I believe that we are history, my love  
Even though you give yourself to someone else.  
I will give you all the time you need to work things out  
When all of the excitement gone  
And you're wondering where you went wrong  
Please remember me.  
  
I guess I've got to learn to give you room to breathe  
When all I really want to do is love you close to me  
They say that I have got to be tough  
That God will see me through  
And though I know you love me  
I'm confused, 'cos he wants me to be with you  
I have never felt so very much alone  
But if this is the end oh then I guess I'll carry on  
No matter what you've done.  
  
How could I believe that we are history, my love  
Even though you give yourself to someone else.  
I will give you all the time you need to work things out  
When all of the excitement gone  
And you're wondering where you went wrong  
Please remember me.  
  
I will give you all the time you need to work things out  
When all of the excitement gone  
And you're wondering where you went wrong  
Please, remember me.  
Please, won't you remember me  
  
I'll be waiting here, got nowhere to go  
I'll be waiting.  
Remember me,  
Remember, remember,  
Please remember me,  
Remember, remember, remember me,  
Remember, remember, remember me,  
Remember, remember, remember me,  
I'll be waiting.

Amazing grace! how sweet the sound  
That saved a wretch like me!  
I once was lost, but now am found  
Was blind, but now I see  
'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear  
And grace my fears relieved  
How precious did that grace appear  
The hour I first believed  
Through many dangers, toils and snares  
I have already come  
'Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far  
And grace will lead me home  
The Lord has promised good to me  
His word my hope secures  
He will be my shield and portion be  
As long as life endures  
Yea, when this flesh and heart shall fail  
And mortal life shall cease  
I shall possess, within the veil  
A life of joy and peace  
When we've been there ten thousand years  
Bright shining as the sun  
We've no less days to sing God's praise  
Than when we'd first begun

Oh darlin' I can see that there's something  
Gettin' to you inside

Love has shout out of the blue - hitting me, and you  
It isn't just attraction  
It's more a chain reaction  
Our love is no ricochet - won't go astray

Be Bop A Lula she's my baby doll, my baby doll, my baby doll.

She's the woman with the flyin' feet  
She's the woman that walks around the store  
She's the woman that yells (scream) more, more, more, more.  
Be Bop A Lula she's my baby  
Be Bop A Lula I don't mean maybe  
Be Bop A Lula she's my baby doll, my baby doll, my baby doll.

What did I ever do for you, that you should die for me  
And what did I ever give to you, that you should live in me  
Now and forever and always true, your love has found a way  
As I was, I am and always will be, will be  
Be in my heart, be in my head  
Be in my soul tonight  
Live in my words, let it be said  
Live in my life tonight  
Pray that I never take in vain, the name I hold most dear  
His love in very heart of me, casts out all doubt and fear  
Now and forever and always true, your love has found a way  
As I was, I am and always will be, will be  
Be in my heart, be in my head  
Be in my soul tonight  
Live in my words, let it be said  
Live in my life tonight  
Tonight we shall sweetly sleep  
Tonight by still waters deep  
Tonight for my soul to keep, still waters lead me to your  
Still waters, I need to drink of your still waters  
Now that I know the kind of love that comes to fill me up  
Fill me anew with love from you and overflow my cup  
Now and forever and always true, your love has found a way  
As I was, I am and always will be, will be  
Be in my heart, be in my head  
Be in my soul tonight  
Live in my words, let it be said  
Live in my life tonight  
Still waters, running deep  
Still waters, my soul to keep  
Still waters, it's your love flowing over me  

May she wake in torment  
Never to find  
Any kind of comfort  
In death  
May her lies satanic  
That corrupt even now  
Bring her back to confront  
Me again  
  
These are words of hatred  
Words of contempt  
Only one who suffered  
At the hands and the heart  
Of a woman who stole  
Both his life and soul  
  
Be with me always  
Possess me and haunt me  
Take any form  
Or take none  
Be with me always  
In flesh or as a ghost  
And you'll learn as the ages run  
Learn what your sin has done  
  
Who is my protector?  
Whence comes my help?  
Who is there to calm me  
But she  
God shall be my witness  
That I pray she will know  
Not one moment of rest  
In the cold cold ground  
  
Be with me always  
Consume and invade me  
Take any shape or disguise  
Be with me always  
To share all my despair  
And to learn nothing justifies  
Reckless inhuman lies  
  
Here comes the night  
The abyss unrelenting  
Casting all reason aside  
And I see in myself  
All the things I see in you  
Hear the savage I am crying  
Be with me always...  

I've sailed an ocean  
I've sailed an ocean before you  
Thought I was free  
Thought that I was free before I met you  
Now I'm no longer the same  
I've found the dream that  
I have been waiting for  
I'm always calling your name  
Feeling joy that I never knew before  
Let's celebrate this better day  
I've climbed a mountain  
I've climbed a mountain before you  
Thought I was wise  
Thought I was wise before I met you  
Now everything is so clear  
I want to be beside you,  
Won't ever leave you  
And I am so lost in love  
That every day I'm waiting for you  
I just want to here with you  
Just want to be with you  
Just want to be where you are,  
It's all I need  
And we'll celebrate this better day  
This destiny  
Has been designed for me by someone  
This mystery  
Has all the signs to make me hold on  
There'll come a day I know now  
A better day when we will belong together  
It's just a touch away now  
Just a kiss and we will be there  
I just want to here with you  
Just want to be with you  
Just want to be where you are,  
It's all I need  
And we'll celebrate this better day  
It's just a touch away now  
Just a kiss and we will be there  
I just want to here with you  
Just want to be with you  
Just want to be where you are,  
It's all I need  
And we'll celebrate this better day  
This better day  
This better day  

How many roads must a man walk down  
Before you call him a man?  
How many seas must a white dove sail  
Before she sleeps in the sand?  
Yes, an' how many times must the cannon balls fly  
Before they're forever banned?  
  
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind  
The answer is blowin' in the wind  
  
Yes, an' how many years can a mountain exist  
Before it is washed to the sea?  
Yes, an' how many years can some people exist  
Before they're allowed to be free?  
Yes, an' how many times can a man turn his head  
And pretend that he just doesn't see?  
  
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind  
The answer is blowin' in the wind  
  
Yes, an' how many times must a man look up  
Before he can see the sky?  
Yes, an' how many ears must one man have  
Before he can hear people cry?  
Yes, an' how many deaths will it take till he knows  
That too many people have died?  
  
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind  
The answer is blowin' in the wind

Blue Moon, you saw me standing alone,  
Without a dream in my heart,  
Without a love of my own,  
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for,  
You heard me saying a prayer for,  
Someone I really could care for,  
  
And then there suddenly appeared before me,  
The only one my arms will ever hold,  
I heard somebody whisper "please adore me,"  
And when I looked the moon had turned to gold,  
  
Blue moon, now I'm no longer alone,  
Without a dream in my heart,  
Without a love of my own.

Well, now that she is gone  
You won't feel bad for long  
For maybe just an hour or  
Just a moment of the day  
Then blue turns to grey  
And try as you may  
You just don't feel good  
And you don't feel alright  
And you know that  
You must find her  
Find her, find her  
You think you'll have a ball  
And you won't hurt at all  
You'll find another girl  
Or maybe more to pass the time away  
Then blue turns grey  
And try as you may  
You just don't feel good  
And you don't feel alright  
And you know that  
You must find her  
Find her, find her  
And you know that  
You must find her  
Find her, find her  
She's not home when you call  
So you then go to all  
All the places where she likes to be  
But she has gone away  
Then blue turns to grey  
And try as you may  
You just don't feel good  
And you don't feel alright  
And you know  
That you must find her  
Find her, find her  
Blue turns to grey  
Blue turns to grey  
Blue turns to grey  
Blue turns to grey  

I found my thrill on blueberry hill  
On blueberry hill where i found you  
The moon stood still on blueberry hill  
And lingered till my dreams came true  
  
The wind in the willow played  
Love's sweet melody  
But all of those vows we made  
Were never to be  
  
Tho' we're apart you're part of me still  
For you were my thrill on blueberry hill  
The wind in the willow played  
Love's sweet melody  
  
But all of those vows we made  
Were never to be  
Tho' we're apart you're part of me still  
For you were my thrill on blueberry hill

If music be the food of love then play on  
Lend me your ears as I lay down this song  
You're touched by the feeling-it's hard to control  
Let me tell you people  
I was born to rock'n'roll  
  
Some people want to fight- some people want to fly  
Others live for pleasure-even do or die  
Some are born to power-try to save a soul  
Let me tell you people  
I was born to rock'n'roll  
  
It may sound a little absurd  
But I was born to spread the word  
Got the music in my soul  
I was born to rock'n'roll  
  
Some people are born to money  
Privileged all their days  
Never had a problem-never had to pay  
But I don't have a doubt about the feeling in my soul  
Let me tell you people  
I was born to rock'n'roll  
  
It may sound a little absurd  
But I was born to spread the word  
Got the music in my soul  
I was born to rock'n'roll  
  
(Instrumental)  
  
It may sound a little absurd  
But I was born to spread the word  
Got the music in my soul  
I was born to rock'n'roll  
  
It may sound a little absurd  
But I was born to spread the word  
Got the music in my soul  
I was born to rock'n'roll  
  
Born to rock'n'roll  
I was born to rock'n'roll

Brother to brother, heart to heart  
There's something I've been trying to tell you  
No matter where you are  
From cradle to shining star  
You're someone to look up to  
Brother to brother worlds apart  
One day I'll promise I'll be with you  
Always I'll love you  
Now just a memory  
A lifetime of rivalry  
I couldn't have a better friend than you  
I used to criticize the way you used to be  
The child that had the look that dreams are made of  
A window to the past looks onto everything I see  
The fire went out the flame just dies  
I couldn't have a better friend than you  
Brother to brother, when we meet again  
There'll be no differences between us  
Free from the darkest night, free till we see the light  
Burning ever after  
Time is a healer, calming our fears  
A thousand questions left unanswered  
Oh I believe in you  
Brother of mine  
Have you ever had somebody you were close to  
Become a memory that's larger than life  
Have you ever felt there's beauty in distortion  
If faiths a crime give me a clue  
And if it is then brother it's still you  

You light the light in my dark places  
The brightest smile in a sea of faces  
Oh you watched me  
You calmed me down just when I thought  
I'd drown  
You lit a flame inside  
I don''t know how  
But they cannot turn the light out on me now  
  
You put a song in my dark silence  
You moved my feet when I could not dance  
And you caught me just when I fell  
You stilled my hell of storms  
You coloured all my greys  
I don't know how  
And they cannot turn the light out on me now  
  
CHORUS Burn on, oh lovely light  
Burn on, there goes the night  
Burn on till all the universe is shining in your light  
Burn on, burn on, burn on

There's two things I know for sure.  
She was sent here from heaven, and she's daddys little girl.  
As I drop to my knees by her bed at night,  
She talks to Jesus, and I close my eyes.  
And I thank God for all the joy in my life, But most of all...  
Butterfly kisses after bedtime prayer.  
Stickin little white flowers all up in her hair.  
"Walk beside the pony daddy, its my first ride."  
"I know the cake looks funny, daddy, but I sure tried."  
Oh, with all that I've done wrong, I must have done something right.  
To deserve a hug every morning, and butterfly kisses at night.  
Sweet sixteen today.  
she's looking like her momma a little more every day.  
One part woman, the other part girl.  
To perfume and makeup, from ribbons and curls.  
Trying her wings in a great big world. But I remember...  
Butterfly kisses after bedtime prayer.  
Stickin little white flowers all up in her hair.  
"You know how much I love you daddy, but if you don't mind,  
I'm only going to kiss you on cheek this time."  
With all that I've done wrong, I must have done something right.  
To deserve a hug every morning, and butterfly kisses at night.  
All the precise time.  
Like the wind, the years go by.  
Precious butterfly, spread your wings and fly.  
Shell change her name today.  
Shell make a promise, and Ill give her away.  
Standing in the bride room just staring at her.  
She asked me what I'm thinking, and I said, "I'm not sure,  
I just feel like I'm losing my baby girl."  
Then she leaned over... and gave me...  
Butterfly kisses, with her mama there.  
Stickin little white flowers all up in her hair.  
"Walk me down the aisle daddy, its just about time."  
"Does my wedding gown look pretty daddy?" "Daddy don't cry."  
With all that I've done wrong, I must have done something right.  
To deserve a hug every morning, and butterfly kisses.  
I couldn't ask God for more, man, this is what love is.  
I know I've gotta let her go, but Ill always remember.  
Every hug in the morning, and butterfly kisses...

I just got to tell someone about the way I feel  
Shout it from the rooftop to the street  
And if I spread the word please tell me who's it gonna  
Hurt  
I'm in love with you girl  
Let me talk to the world  
I feel like I'm up there riding a rocket to the moon  
And I'm gonna tell them where I've been  
  
Can't keep this feelin' in  
Not for another minute  
I can't hold it back  
You know I'm trying to  
I just gotta count the ways  
You bless my days  
Baby I can't keep this feelin in  
  
Some things should be private just between  
The two of us  
Trust me when I say my lips are sealed  
My god It's no big secret that I'm crazy  
For your love  
Want to put up a sign that the lady is mine  
If you're superstitious I'm gonna try to  
Hold it down  
But I'm going out there on a limb  
Can't keep this feelin' in  
Not for another minute  
I can't hold it back  
You know I'm trying to  
I just gotta count the ways  
You bless my days  
Baby I can't keep this feelin in  
  
I know it's better if we take it slow  
That's when the hours feel like years  
I've gotta tell somebody that's all I know  
If I've gotta whisper whisper in their ears  
  
Repeat chorus out

Now that the past has ended  
My life's an open door  
I know that we could have been mended  
Oh but I can't take the hurt anymore  
Can't take the hurt anymore  
Ooh ooh can't take the hurt anymore  
The rainbow's over  
But I've seen it leave before  
A love that's been left in the corner  
Ooh 'cause I can't take the hurt anymore  
Can't take the hurt anymore  
Ooh ooh can't take the hurt anymore  
Lady of my lady's  
Can't we find the right  
And leave behind the sorrow  
Lady of my lady's  
Can't we find the light  
Bright enough to guide us  
Can't take the hurt anymore  
Ooh ooh can't take the hurt anymore  
This love grows older  
But I've felt it all before  
Yesterday's over my shoulder  
Ooh 'cause I can't take the hurt anymore  
Can't take the hurt anymore  
Ah ah can't take the hurt anymore  
My love I found has lost it's crown  
But I just can't leave it die  
I fool myself and no one else  
'cause I would if I could and I try  
Can't take the hurt anymore etc....  

  
I've tried to ignore  
All the stench of your life  
Only holding back  
For my wife  
Even she has seen  
Your poisoned soul displayed  
Seen each move you've made  
Contaminate, degrade  
  
Who's this juvenile?  
Who's this infantile clown?  
He's not ever worth  
Knocking down  
Stamp your tiny foot  
My precious little lamb  
Bleat ad nauseam  
But i don't give a damn  
  
Where to go? heart ever hounded  
Coward? no - spirit confounded  
Always hoping belief will bring release  
God alone can give me peace  
Watching me scream and hate  
Only choosing when it's too late  
  
May this imbecile  
Cause your heart to feel joy  
You did after all  
Choose the toy  
Do you now suppose  
I'll leave with no reply?  
Basic laws apply  
An eye demands an eye  
  
Where to go? heart ever hounded  
Coward? no - spirit confounded  
Always hoping belief will bring release  
God alone can give peace  
Watching me scream and hate  
Only choosing when it's too late

What kind of love is this that leaves me feeling cold  
You look right through me what see nobody knows  
You're in a world all by yourself - needing no one else  
Feeling so secure  
  
You're on the road to nowhere, left your past behind  
What's to become of me, should feelings be denied  
Another time another place, would i be the same old face  
For you to have around  
  
There's no way in, there's no way out i'm caught in the middle  
Why must you leave my heart in doubt  
We have a one way love that flows from me to you  
There's nothing more for me to lose  
  
We're through with talking now we know that it's the end  
We've played our foolish games amd it's useless to pretend  
It seems like only yesterday, that love had come to stay  
How could we be so blind  
  
There's no way in, there's no way out i'm caught in the middle  
Why must you leave my heart in doubt  
We have a one way love that flows from me to you  
There's nothing more for me to lose  
  
I don't know where your heart is or what's inside your head  
If this is love you said it, if this is love forget it  
If this is love then count me out

You're my love  
You're my angel  
You're the girl of my dreams  
And I'd like to thank you  
For waiting patiently  
  
Daddy's home - daddy's home - to stay  
  
How I've waited for this moment  
To be by your side  
Your best friend wrote and told me  
You had tear drops in your eyes  
  
Daddy's home - daddy's home - to stay  
  
It wasn't on a Sunday  
(Monday and Tuesday went by)  
It wasn't on a Tuesday afternoon  
(All I could do was cry)  
But I made a promise  
That you treasure  
And I made it back home to you  
  
How I've waited for this moment  
To be by your side  
Your best friend wrote and told me  
You had tear drops in your eyes  
  
Daddy's home - daddy's home - to stay.....  
Daddy's home - to stay.....  
I'm not a thousand miles away

If some guy tells you, I don't care  
And tells you lies while I'm not there  
Don't talk to him  
If he tells you, I'm untrue  
Then darling, here what you must do  
Don't talk to him  
And if he tells you I've been seen  
Walking 'round with Sue and Jean  
He's lying again (lying again)  
Do anything that you want to  
But darling, this I beg of you  
Don't talk to him  
  
If you hear the words he has to say  
He'll break your heart  
Let your love for me prove strong  
While we are far apart  
  
So just remember what'd I say  
(And) Trust in me while I'm away for I'll be true  
And just remember my true love is  
Brighter than the moon above for only you  
And if this guy should try to say  
My love for you is only plain  
Nearly a wind (nearly a wind)  
Just close your eyes and count to ten  
And think of me again  
But don't you talk to him  
  
And if this guy should try to say  
My love for you is only plain  
Merely a whim (Merely a whim)  
Just close your eyes and count to ten  
And think of me again  
But don't you talk to him  
  
If you hear the words he has to say  
He'll break your heart  
Let your love for me prove strong  
While we are far apart  
  
So just remember what'd I say  
Trust in me while I'm away for I'll be true  
And just remember my true love is  
Brighter than the moon above for only you  
And if this guy should try to say  
My love for you is only plain  
Merely a whim (Merely a whim)  
Just close your eyes, count to ten  
And think of me again  
But don't you talk to him

I shall think it a dream tomorrow  
I won't believe you returned  
That once again I saw and touched you  
And you're so unconserned, unconcerned  
You must have known that your cruel silence  
Would be so hard to bear  
And yet you let me wait, you let me wait and  
Wonder  
Neither here nor there, here nor there  
I came back with just one intention  
For one last look, one last taste of you  
Revenge on those who still despise me  
And take my own life too  
But there's a long and twisted journey  
Between this callous thought and deed  
And you're a sweeter way to give me  
All the things I need  
Two ambitions coincidind  
Will only happen now and then  
Never hope or dream tomorrow  
Will restore your faith again  
Never hope or dream tomorrow  
Will restore your faith again  
How I hope it's no dream tomorrow  
But I'm scared the light will fade  
And today will be a vague recollection  
Just a fool's escapade, escapade  
I never cared much about the future  
Yesterday was always there  
So when you give me hope, hope or a promise  
It just isn't fair, isn't fair  
Any plan, any calculation  
Any plot or device at all  
Runs into another's dream  
Runs into a wall  
No matter what premeditation  
In our three score years and ten  
There are only fractured moments  
We'd want to live again  
Two ambitions coinciding  
Will only happen now and then  
Never hope or dream tomorrow  
Will restore your faith again  
Never hope or dream tomorrow  
Will restore you faith again  

Nothing can be permanent  
Nothing set in stone  
Never try to fool yourself  
That you are not alone  
Know your place don't chance your arm  
Your secrets are all known  
Never cross the great divide  
Each to his own  
Don't misunderstand me, don't be hurt, don't take offence  
But what I am about to tell you makes a lot of sense  
I've been more than happy with you, loved you as you are  
But being happy only takes a restless heart so far  
Be thankful for the past but know those times won't come again  
I found you quite diverting, even tender now and then  
Remember I will always be the first to sing your praise  
But I must close the book on our adolescent days  
Nothing can be permanent  
Nothing set in stone  
Never try to fool yourself  
That you are not alone  
Know your place don't chance your arm  
Your secrets are all known  
Never cross the great divide  
Each to his own  
Did you really think we'd never drift apart?  
That we'd decay together in some endless heart to heart  
Did you never realise that we are not the same?  
We are made what we are made - you are not to blame  
Nothing can be permanent  
Nothing set in stone  
Never try to fool yourself  
That you are not alone  
Know your place don't chance your arm  
Your secrets are all known  
Never cross the great divide  
Each to his own  

Evening is the time of day  
I find nothing much to say  
Don't know what to do  
But I come to  
  
When it's early in the morning  
Over by the windows day is dawning  
When I feel the air  
I feel that life is very good to me, you know  
In the sun there's so much yellow  
Something in the early morning meadow  
Tells me that today you're on your way  
And you'll be coming home, home to me  
  
Night time isn't clear to me  
I find nothing near to me  
Don't know what to do  
But I come to  
  
When it's early in the morning  
Very, very early without warning  
I can feel a newly born vibration  
Sneaking up on me again  
There's a songbird on my pillow  
I can see the fun in weeping willow  
I can see the sun  
You're on your way  
You'll be coming home  
  
When it's early in the morning  
Over by the windows day is dawning  
When I feel the air  
I feel that life is very good to me, you know  
In the sun there's so much yellow  
Something in the early morning meadow  
Tells me that today you're on your way  
And you'll be coming home  
  
When it's early in the morning  
Very, very early without warning  
I can feel a newly born vibration  
Sneaking up on me again...

Spent all of his life in love with money  
Never found love he never got lucky no  
One hundred are the times he tried  
And every time he lost a part of him died  
  
Love can be found the people would tell  
So he threw his heart  
In the wishing well  
Young Julie the girl from the city  
  
With eyes full of pain and a heart  
Full of pity yeah and she said...  
No use cryin' 'bout your living dying  
You're gotta make your peace  
  
And and let your livin' just ease along  
Let your livin' just ease along  
You've got to give up livin' your life like a demon  
Find your heart and the why, and the where,  
  
And the reason  
Oh - oh - oh  
She took him up the mountain side  
Where the air was clear and the water was wine  
  
She loved him when the night was still  
And the stars danced on the window sill  
And over and over again  
The lovers looked out from the mountain rim  
  
There was no need to reach for the stars  
You could catsh them all night and keep them in jars  
And she told him...  
No use cryin' 'bout your living dying  
  
You're gotta make your peace  
And and let your livin' just ease along  
Let your livin' just ease along  
You've got to give up livin' your life like a demon  
  
Find your heart and the why, and the where,  
And the reason  
Ease along you've got to ease along  
Spent all his life in love with money-ease along  
  
Never found love never got lucky-ease along  
With eyes full of pain and her heart full of pity-  
Ease along  
Young Julie the girl from the city said-ease along

Oh darling, will our love be like an evergreen tree  
Stay ever green and young as the seasons go  
Your kisses could make love grow like an evergreen tree  
Bloom in the summer's sun and the winter's snow  
  
On every branch will blossom, dreams for me and you  
Our tree of love will stay ever green, if our hearts stay ever true  
  
Oh darling, I love you so, don't you know that I'll be  
True 'til the leaves turn blue on the evergreen tree  
  
On every branch will blossom, dreams for me and you  
Our tree of love will stay ever green, if our hearts stay ever true  
Oh darling, I love you so, don't you know that I'll be  
True 'til the leaves turn blue on the evergreen tree  
  
On the evergreen tree, on the evergreen tree.

Look at the man in the corner  
He's sitting all alone  
His blankets are made out of cardboard  
And his pillows are made out of stone  
Every face tells a storcy  
It never tells a lie  
Every face tells a story  
It never tells a lie  
See the man walking on the water  
See the light in his eyes  
He came into the world with a message to tell  
He came into the world to die  
Every face tells a story  
It never tells a lie  
Every face tells a story  
It never tells a lie  
You're always telling stories  
You're always telling me lies  
You're always telling stories, why?  
So think of yourself in the water  
Seeing your days flashing by  
It's too late to see what you wanted to be  
You've spent all your time, you must die  
Every face tells a story  
It never tells a lie  
Every face tells a story  
It never tells a lie, oh  
You're always telling stories  
You're always telling me lies  
You're always telling stories, why?  
Why don't you step down  
And make it work out right  
I'm trying to get to you with my warning  
Been here for nearly half the night  
Look it's nearly four in the morning  

Everybody needs to cry some  
Everybody can't be wise  
Everybody needs some understanding  
Understanding when you cry  
Everybody knows  
Love doesn't always begin like this  
Everybody knows  
Love doesn't always end with a kiss  
See I've been in love and I know  
And now you've been in love and you know  
Anyone who's ever hurt you  
Anyone who's ever tried  
Will only love you then desert you  
Won't believe you when you cry  
Everybody knows  
Love doesn't always begin like this  
Everybody knows  
Love doesn't always end with a kiss  
See I've been in love and I know  
And now you've been in love and you know  
(guitar solo)  
Everybody knows  
Love doesn't always begin like this  
Everybody knows  
Love doesn't always end with a kiss  
See I've been in love and I know  
And now you've been in love and you know  
See I've been in love and I know  
And now you've been in love and you know  
Everybody needs to cry some  
Everybody can't be wise  
Everybody needs some understanding  
Understanding when you cry  
Everybody knows  
Love doesn't always end like this  

Looking around nowhere to go  
Looking high but you're feelin' low  
Ready or not you got to run when you can  
Stealin' time just like everyman  
Oh oh want to let you know

Everyman everyman

My eyes may see the coming King in all his majesty  
In company all dressed in white  
But meanwhile here at the world's dark end  
The dragon draws the iron curtain round against the light  
And souls grow weary in his war of love  
and seek their solace strolling down the sweet civilian ways  
But meanwhile back at the world's dark end  
The nations see no future waiting for the serpent to strike  
CHORUS: Where have all the Christian soldiers gone  
Where is the resistance, will no-one be strong  
When will we stand up tall and straight, rise up and storm the gate  
How can we fail to get excited  
The battle is ours, why don't we fight it  
Battalions of darkness rise above me  
But God put a fighter in me, put a fighter in me  
So we will sing songs of victory  
We will rise and set men free  
We will applaud your majesty  
We will proclaim your kingdom come  
We will announce the battle done  
We will lift up the righteous one  
Listen and you're going to hear the sweetest sound you ever heard  
It's the spirit blowing across the land  
It's the voice of one who calls his bride to come and to be ready  
Gentle as a dove he comes with fire  
CHORUS:

Whatever happened  
To the teenage romance  
Is it hidden in a tacky magazine  
Everybody's talking  
Saying trash is neat  
You think it's good fun  
But it's never that free  
Who is the man of the moment  
Does his image stand ten feet tall  
Or is he just a cardboard hero  
Staring down at you from your wall  
  
You can dream but you can't touch  
You can dream but not too much  
You can dream but you can't touch  
You can dream but not too much  
  
Friday night  
Out on the town  
It's a special date  
First time around  
You read all about the story book romance  
He stands there waiting  
And you want to hold his hand  
Saturday  
You're broken down  
Your heart is lying somewhere  
Is it lost or found  
  
You can dream but you can't touch  
You can dream but not too much  
You can dream but you can't touch  
If this is love it's not enough  
  
You can dream but you can't touch  
You can dream but not too much  
You can dream but you can't touch  
You want a love that costs too much  
You can dream but you can't touch  
If this is love it's not enough  
You can dream of tender touch  
Don't let your heart be lost to love  

I took your name you took my number  
Look me up if you're in my town  
You made a friend be sure of that  
Let me know if you're free come down  
You're making plans-things you'll do  
Said I'll be someone I'm telling you  
  
I'm gonna leave this town play me some rock'n'roll  
I'm gonna find myself I'm gonna free my soul  
  
We took a walk out in the grey  
You didn't speak but had much to say  
Don't talk too loud walls have ears  
Criticise and you'll disappear  
A souvenir from where you've gone  
A pair of jeans or some chewing gum  
  
I'm gonna leave this town play me some rock'n'roll  
I'm gonna find myself I'm gonna free my soul  
They built the wall until they had something to hide  
To keep me out or is it to keep you inside  
  
I'm gonna free me...

From a distance, the world looks blue and green,  
And the snow capped mountains so white.  
From a distance the ocean meets the stream,  
And the eagle takes to flight.  
From a distance, there is harmony  
And it echoes through the land.  
It's the voice of hope, it's the voice of peace,  
It's the voice of every man.  
  
From a distance, we all have enough,  
And no-one is in need.  
There are no guns, no bombs and no disease  
No hungry mouths to feed.  
For a moment we must be instruments,  
Marching in a common band,  
Playing songs of hope, playing songs of peace,  
They're is the songs of every one.  
  
God is watching us, god is watching us,  
God is watching us, from a distance.  
  
From a distance, you look like my friend,  
Even though we are at war.  
From a distance, i can't comprehend,  
What all this war is for.  
What we need is love and harmony,  
Let it echo through the land.  
It's the hope of hopes, it's the love of loves,  
It's the heart of everyone.  
It's the hope of hopes, it's the love of loves,  
It's the song of everyone.  
  
Sing out, songs of hope,  
Sing out, songs of freedom,  
Sing out, songs of love,  
Sing out, songs of peace,  
  
Sing out, songs of justice,  
Sing out, songs of harmony,  
Sing out, songs of love,  
Sing out, everyone,  
  
Sing out, songs of hope,  
Sing out, songs of freedom,  
Sing out, songs of love,  
Sing out, songs of peace,  
  
Sing out, songs of justice,  
Sing out, songs in harmony,  
Sing out, sing about love,  
Sing out, everyone.  
Sing out.

My love is turning.  
Like a wheel of fire she burns her way.  
My love is burning.  
She's a light to guide me through the fray.  
Galadriel, spirit of starlight.  
Eagle and dove gave birth to thee.  
Galadriel, spirit of starlight.  
You are my love and earth to me, my  
Love and earth to me.  
My love is seeing.  
Through unabiased eyes she reads the signs.  
My love is searching.  
For new life somewhere she's bound to find.  
Galadriel, spirit of starlight.  
Eagle and dove give birth to thee.  
Galadriel, spirit of starlight.  
You are my love and earth to me.  
My love and earth to me.  
  

Got every reason to feel like I do  
From the top of my head to the bottom of my shoes  
'Cause last night my baby took the weight off my mind  
Told me everything was gonna be fine  
She said she loved me  
I'm never gonna be without the love she promised to give me  
'Cause she says every night, hold me tight, forever is right  
Love is bright, moon delight, she's outta sight  
Give me, give me, give me love your way  
She could have resisted my efforts to pry  
But she knows how I feel and she's not exactly shy  
Though right now I'm lonely I know it won't be long  
I can hear the train comin' bringin' lovin' along  
She said she loved me  
I'm never gonna be without the love she promised to give me  
'Cause she says every night, hold me tight, forever is right  
Love is bright, moon delight, she's outta sight  
Give me, give me, give me love your way  
Oh I used to be so lost and confused  
I stumbled through knowing that each door I tried  
Was closed before me and knowing that I cried  
But still I didn't rest I had to know  
What was behind it all I'd come so far  
And then I saw her note I couldn't believe she wrote  
I couldn't resist it being beside her  
Could have held that moment forever in my heart  
The moment I saw her was the moment I knew  
That her love is my life and her light's shining through  
She said she loved me  
I'm never gonna be without the love she promised to give me  
'Cause she says every night, hold me tight, forever is right  
Love is bright, moon delight, she's outta sight  
Give me, give me, give me love your way  
Oh I used to be so lost and confused  
I stumbled through knowing that each door I tried  
Was closed before me and knowing that I cried  
But still I didn't rest I had to know  
What was behind it all I'd come so far  
And then I saw her note I couldn't believe she wrote

God rest ye, merry gentlemen, let nothing you dismay  
Remember Christ our Savior was born on Christmas day  
To save us all from Satan's power when we were gone astray  
  
O tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy  
O tidings of comfort and joy  
  
From god our heav'nly Father a blessed angel came  
And unto certain shepherds brought tidings of the same  
How that in Bethlehem was born the son of god by name  
  
"Fear not, then," said the angel, "Let nothing you afright  
This day is born a savior of a pure virgin bright  
To free all those who trust in him from Satan's power and might"  
  
The shepherds at those tidings rejoiced much in mind  
And left their flocks a-feeding in tempest, storm and wind  
And went to Bethlehem straightaway this blessed babe to find  
  
But when to Bethlehem they came whereat this infant lay  
They found him in a manger where oxen feed on hay  
His mother Mary kneeling unto the Lord did pray  
  
Now to the Lord sing praises all you within this place  
And with true love and brotherhood each other now embrace  
This holy tide of Christmas all others doth deface  
  
God bless the ruler of this house, and send him long to reign  
And many a merry Christmas may live to see again  
Among your friends and kindred that live both far and near--  
That God send you a happy New Year, happy New Year  
And God send you a happy New Year

You shake my nerves and you rattle my brain  
Too much love drives a man insane  
You broke my will, but what a thrill  
Goodness, gracious, great balls of fire  
  
I laughed at love 'cause I thought it was funny  
You came along and moved me honey  
I've changed my mind, your love is fine  
Goodness, gracious, great balls of fire  
  
Kiss me baby, woo feels good  
Hold me baby, wellllll  
I want to love you like a lover should  
Your fine, so kind  
I want to tell the world that your mine mine mine mine  
  
I chew my nails and I twiddle my thumbs  
I'm really nervous, but it sure is fun  
Come on baby, drive my crazy  
Goodness, gracious, great balls of fire!!  
  
Kiss me baby, woo feels good

Searching for a green light  
Looking for it all night  
Using all my keen sight  
Searching for a green light  
  
From just this side of midnight  
'Til dawn breaks into daylight  
Keepin' myself out of sight  
Searching for a green light  
  
Well I've heard this story before  
But that doesn't stop me searching  
It's been so long since you gave me a sign  
A sign to stop my head turning  
But all I have are just your old memories  
But you know baby, baby that's fine  
'Cause I'm spending all of my time  
  
Searching for a green light  
Looking for it all night  
Using all my keen sight  
Searching for a green light  
  
From just this side of midnight  
'til dawn breaks into daylight  
Keepin' myself out of sight  
Searching for green light  
Lookin' around  
  
But all I have are your old memories  
But you know baby baby that's fine  
'Cause I'm spending all of my time  
  
Searching for a green light  
Looking for it all night  
Using all my keen sight  
Searching for a green light  
  
Searching for a green light  
From just this of midnight etc....

She wears her hair real wild  
Her nails are perfectly filed  
Her lips painted deep jungle red  
Her best color is black  
And the clothes on her back  
Show she's a woman with style  
She wears satin and lace with impeccable taste  
She'll tell you it runs in her blood  
In a cloud of perfume she walks into the room  
And it comes to a stop when she does  
She's a heart user  
No time for losers  
She'll use you up and throw your love away  
Heart user  
A barracuda  
She'll use you just don't get in her way  
Oozing with charm got a girl on each arm  
His eyes match his all over tan  
And as he straightens his tie  
Some beauty catches his eye  
Brings out the best in the man  
And her fresh young face makes his cold heart race  
She's wearing that deadly perfume  
You must admire the skill as he comes in for the kill  
It's time to attack make his move  
He's a heart user  
No time for losers  
He'll use you up and throw your love away  
Heart user  
A barracuda  
He'll use you just don't get in his way  
Where you been all my life  
This is love at first sight  
Could swear we've met someone before  
She throws back her head  
And she shamelessly says  
You got real good taste tell me more  
Then the lady in black thinks she's setting her trap  
And he thinks she's playing his game  
But anybody can tell they're just into themselves  
They're two of a kind they're the same  
They're just heart users  
No time for losers  
They'll use you up and throw your love away  
Heart users  
They're barracuda  
They'll use you just don't get in their way...

Seems to me that you're always nere  
Close enough so I know when you're here  
Just when I think I got to know you-you disappear  
And so I walk along building all my dreams

And just when I think I've found the right one you disappear

Oh why I'm here  
  
I've even wished on a falling star  
I've carried moonbeams home in a jar  
Only one thing wrong  
You're where you belong  
And that's too far  
If only there was some way of reaching you  
Holding you cause I'm so doggone blue  
Only one thing I really want to do  
Is sing to you  
That's why I'm (here) here waiting for you  
I'm (here) here still holding on  
I'm (here) here waiting-baby I'm  
(here) but it won't be too long  
Cause I'm planning a song that will tell you  
Oh why I'm (here) here I'm waiting for you baby

Gonna get me a gal that'll go out on the town  
Well you move on down the line  
I'm gonna get me a gal that'll make some time  
She can't be square, she can't be slow  
  
'Cause when we start struttin', gotta go-go-go  
Well I'm gonna show you ain't so hot

Gonna get me a gal that'll go out on the town  
Well you move on down the line  
  
I'm gonna get me a gal that'll make some time  
She can't be square, she can't be slow  
'Cause when we start struttin', gotta go-go-go

My heart has no desire to  
Stay where doubts arise  
And fears dismay.  
Though we must dwell  
Where these are bound  
I must go on to higher ground.  
I want to scale the  
Utmost hight and catch  
A gleam of glory bright.  
For faith has caught  
The joyful sound,  
The song of life on higher ground.  
Lord, lift me up  
And let me stand my feet  
On heaven's stable land.  
Oh, greater plane  
That I have found.  
Oh, plant my feet on higher ground.  
I'm treading on the  
Upward way, new hights  
I'm gaining every day,  
Still praying as I'm homeward bound:  
Oh, plant my feet on higher ground.  

Yes it is his land, all of it his  
He stepped it off and marked it there,...stepped it off and marked it there  
To be his ugly thoroughfare,...to be his ugly thoroughfare  
And he blessed it with his hand,...yes it's a great land, all of it is  
And as it blooms before our eyes,...as it blooms before our eyes  
Just like an eden paradise,...like an eden paradise  
The world will understand,...world will understand...this is his land  
Slowly from hiding but surely they come  
Back to the homeland their fathers will front  
Israel their citadel, israel their home  
Now they are here at last never to roam  
Here they will stay and bring life to the land  
It's a new day and with boldness they walk, tall and so straight  
See them stand  
Yes it is his land, all of it his  
He stepped it off and marked it there...stepped it off and marked it there  
To be his ugly thoroughfare,...to be his ugly thoroughfare  
And then he blessed it with his land,...yes it's a great land, all of it is  
And as blooms before our eyes,...as it blooms before our eyes  
Like an eden paradise,...like an eden paradise  
The world will understand,...world will understand...this is his land  
Rich fertile valleys of russet and gold, carpets of green over mountains  
Unfold  
Harvest of plenty so joyous and bright, her fields her treasures  
Magnificent sight  
This is the israel promised of old, this is the miracle happening now  
As ages in prophets fortold  
Yes it is his land......  

Nothing ever stays the same  
Everything must change  
Just take a look around you  
You know it will astound you  
History unfolding shows us  
Good intentions pass  
And a love once pledged in moonlight  
Isn't guaranteed to last  
Chorus:  
(only your love is constant baby)  
(only my love for you)  
Only your love can hold us together  
Only you - and everything you do  
Just one kiss and my dreams come true  
Only you - and everything you say  
Only loving you - can make me feel this way  
People who just play at love  
Make loving something cheap  
And it's only worth the playing if we  
Play the game for keeps  
The book of life has pages girl  
That you and I must turn  
And in every chapter in every story  
Something there to learn  
Repeat chorus  
Love is patient, love is kind  
Love is rarely ever blind  
Take a look and you will find  
That love is just caring  
And sharing our loving together  

Ready steady gonna meet you on the ballroom floor,  
Brother Eddie quit your banging on my bathroom door,  
After shaving yeah and after three,  
I'm after having me some fun you see,  
I'm getting ready for the night to come,  
And here i come.  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm just a hot shot hitting town,  
(have a little fun),  
Just a hot shot getting down,  
(ready steady run),  
I'm just a hot shot looking around,  
(loving on the run),  
I'm having fun.  
  
Get the recognition each and every place i go,  
Fashion leader in the Cuban heel and pointed toe,  
My Italian suit is pressed and clean,  
I'm the Latin lover of the local scene,  
I'm getting ready for the night to come.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
A faded picture on the mantelshelf,  
My older brother looks like myself,  
Remember Donny dated Susie,  
And Susie rated johnny,  
Johnny's into Susie,  
But Susie's into Ronnie,  
Ronnie waits for Louie,  
But Louie's singing Louie  
  
[Chorus]

You ask me how the flowers grow  
And what makes the glow worm glow  
How high is the sky, how long is forever  
  
You want to know how any corn small  
Grows to be a tree so tall  
How deep is a sigh, how long is forever  
  
Oh, all your little funny ways  
I just can't ignore  
All the foolish things you say  
Make me love you more  
  
You ask me if, if my love is true  
Here's the answer I give you  
I'll be at your side as long as forever  
  
Oh, all your little funny ways  
I just can't ignore  
All the foolish things you say  
Make me love you more, forever

How wonderful to know you really love me  
How wonderful to know you really care  
How beautiful to feel my arms around you  
  
Kissing your eyes  
Hearing your sighs  
Touching your hair  
  
How wonderful to know sunshine and laughter  
That fills my empty heart with love divine  
To share this life with you now and hereafter  
  
How wonderful to know that you are mine  
To share this life with you now and hereafter  
How wonderful to know that you are mine

No one on earth means more to me Your painted pictures are the way that the
world should be Don't ever change it, I don't wanna live in this world without
you Oh no I can't explain, I can't define What you do to me, but my senses are
so alive You tell your story and it's all that I ever believe Portraits and
poetry are frozen forms of perfection But they don't live and breathe When my
heart's in need they don't answer me You - ooo oooh you are, you're a human
work of art Walking, talking inspiration You - ooo oooh you are, you're a
human work of art You make me love, you make me care You give me freedom I
don't need when I know you're there My search is over I've got all of the
riches that money don't buy, Oh no Your words are poetry and your face is more
than perfection The way I watch you move it only goes to prove In everything
to do You - oooh oooh you are, you're a human work of art Walking, talking
inspiration You - ooooh ooh you are, you're a human work of art You're my
mission You're my goal Oooh you liberate my soul There's no illusion, that
your touch is gold Portraits and poetry are frozen forms of perfection The way
I watch you move it only goes to prove In everything you do You - oooh oooh
you are, you're a human work of art Walking, talking new sensation You - ooooh
oooh you are, you're a human work of art Walking, talking inspiration

Got no time to stop to speak to friends passing by  
Got no strength to wipe away the tears from my eyes  
I don't care what's going on  
Only know she's gone  
  
The sun don't shine anymore  
And I don't feel fine anymore  
She ain't mine anymore  
No, I don't feel fine anymore  
I ain't got time anymore  
  
Seems to be such sadness in each place I go  
The people laugh and still I just wouldn't know  
Never stop to see who's there  
Once I used to care  
  
But the sun don't shine anymore  
I don't feel fine anymore  
She ain't mine anymore  
No, I don't feel fine anymore  
I ain't got time anymore  
  
I can't get used to being left on my own  
It takes up all the time just trying to be alone  
Used to take an interest in the state of affairs  
Now I only know how much I'm missing that girl  
Hope the world will understand I can't lend a hand  
  
'Cause she ain't mine anymore  
I don't feel fine anymore  
She ain't mine anymore  
No, I don't feel fine anymore  
Ain't got time anymore  
  
She ain't mine anymore  
I don't feel fine anymore  
Ain't got time anymore  
She ain't mine anymore  
No, I don't feel fine anymore

You could have been a bad girl  
And wasted all my time  
You could have got me mad girl  
And made me lose my mind  
But you did what you have to do  
And every word you said to me was true  
You gave me what I asked for  
And I can't ask for anymore than you  
  
It makes me very proud baby  
To know that you're my girl  
I want to say it loud baby  
I want to tell the world  
That you did what you had to do  
And every word you said to me was true  
You gave me what I asked for  
And I can't ask for anymore than you  
I've got everything a man could need  
Oh I feel just like a slave that has been freed  
I won't cry myself to sleep no more  
'Cause I've found the love that I've been looking for  
  
Now I don't have a problem  
'Cause I know who I am  
You see I lost my only problem  
When you made me your man  
'Cause you did what you had to do  
And every word you said to me was true  
You gave me what I asked for  
And I can't ask for anymore than you

Your love means more to me than  
All the apples hanging on a tree and  
Like those apples, our love will grow because I,  
I love you.  
  
Your love means more to me than  
All the fishes swimming in the sea and  
Like those fishes, my heart begins to swim because I,  
I love you.  
  
I love you, I want you for my own.  
I need you near to me  
More than anyone could ever know.  
  
Your love means more to me than  
All the loves I've ever had before, so,  
Please believe what I say because I -  
I love you  
  
I love you  
  
I love you, I want you for my own.  
I need you so much more,  
More than anyone could ever know.  
  
Everyone knows one and one makes two,  
I'm the one and the other one's you, so,  
Let's get together and you will see how much I,  
I love you  
Let's get together and you will see how much I,  
I love you

If what you said last night is true  
Then you don't know me as well as you should  
No one could ever be so wrong  
And if this look I wear fools you  
Well I got a good reason  
You see I'm really not so strong  
I need love like every other man  
Get scared when you turn away  
I need love I will do all I can - stay  
Now I've seen sorrow felt no pain  
I never felt nothing at all  
It's not the way I want to be  
And when you're gone these empty hours  
Cut me again  
What does it take to make you see  
I need love like every other man  
Get scared when you turn away  
I need love and I'll do all I can please stay  
Somebody up there likes me  
Cause they've opened up the door  
You won't see me chasing rainbows anymore  
I need love like any other man  
Get scared when you turn away  
I need love I'll do all I can please stay

I wake up crying  
After tossin' and turnin'  
And a-yearnin' the whole night long  
Pretty baby since you went away  
I haven't spent a happy day  
  
I wake up crying  
After sobbin' and sighin'  
And a-wonderin' just what went wrong  
Pretty baby I was good to you  
Why'd you go and make me blue  
  
I need your arms to hold me tight  
I need your sweet lips to kiss me goodnight  
I'm so unhappy on my own  
Don't don't leave me sad and lonely  
  
I wake up crying  
After tossin' and turnin'  
And a-yearnin' the whole night long  
Pretty baby please come back to me  
Save me from this mesery  
Oh baby won'tcha save me from this mesery  
Please baby won'tcha save me from this mesery

Life was filled with guns and war  
And everyone got trampled on the floor  
I wish we'd all been ready  
Children died the day grew cold  
  
A piece of bread could buy a bag of gold  
I wish we'd all been ready  
There's no time to change your mind  
The son has come and you've been left behind  
  
A man and wife sleep in bed she hears a noise  
And turns her head he's gone  
I wish we'd all been ready  
Two men walking up a hill one disappears and  
  
One's left standing still  
I wish we'd all been ready  
There's no time to change your mind  
The son has come and you've been left behind  
  
Life was filled with guns and war  
And everyone got trampled on the floor  
I wish we'd all been ready  
Children died the days grew cold  
  
A piece of bread could buy a bag of gold  
I wish we'd all been ready  
There's no time to change your mind  
How could you have been so blind  
  
The father spoke the demons dined  
The son has come and you've been left behind.

If you walked away from me today  
I am sure that who you were going to  
Would feel the way as I do  
Baby it's you who fills up my life  
  
And if you walked away from me today  
It wouldn't change a thing  
I'd still be singin' celebration of you  
Baby, you do, you fill up my life  
  
You my life'til now  
No one's been able to show me how  
To fill my life like you  
You are the woman who taught me to  
And if you walked away from me today  
Never to retur Until the journey that you made had ended  
I know you planned it just to fill up my life  
You my life,now I know what it feels like to overflow  
Until my life is through  
A'll I'm here for,is here for you,just for you  
Only for you

Why do we try so hard  
What makes us give our all  
And why do we aspire  
To reach the height  
When we're not ready  
To take the fall  
  
What makes us so unkind  
  
And why must we desire  
And take what we want  
Why must we be the  
Only ones who receive  
  
Lord won't you take me  
Take me and break me  
Burn me with your fire  
Our love that will take me  
Take me and make me  
I'll be  
I will follow you  
  
Why is it that now I'm yours  
Everything seems so bright  
And why is it now I can  
Live for each day  
Without any fear of the night  
  
Lord since I met you  
I can't get you  
Out of my head  
My life was so lonely  
Cos I was only  
Living for myself  
Our love  
I will follow you  
  
Chorus  
  
I'll follow you  
My days are right  
I'll follow you  
It seems so right  
I'll follow you  
Bad days are gone  
I'll follow you

Im looking out the window  
Im waitin at the door  
To see if youll be coming by  
The way you did before  
The way you did before  
  
You told me you were taken  
But now you've set me free  
And I believed you when you said  
Your only love was me  
Your only love was me  
  
I bought a silk to please you  
I wear it every day  
I wear it just a in case you'll call  
I wore it yesterday  
I wore it yesterday  
  
I hear them talk about you  
They say youre like the rest  
They say youll never break away  
And Im just second best  
And Im just second best  
  
Im looking out the window  
Im waitin at the door  
And hopin youll be coming by  
The way you did before  
The way you did before

The record man said'don't let it go to your head,I'm gonna make you a star'  
If you've got it,use it,but don't abuse it,gave me money from an old fruit jar  
To exercise my delight,I went out that night and shook the town the way I knew  
How  
So mama please don't worry about me,I'm nearly famous now  
Six months later I'm a cool operator,and I know my way around  
The record man sighed,he really tried,but he couldn't get it off the ground  
But that don't bother me now 'cause I've got a friend who's gotta friend who  
Really knows how  
So mama please don't worry about me,I'm nearly famous now  
Still hanging on,still hanging on,hang on  
I met this real live walking,self-styled,self-assured,slow talking bore  
I thought I'd play him along,give him a song,to keep the doom dust away from  
My door  
But I didn't do what he wanted me to,but it didn't seem to matter somehow  
So mama please don't worry about me,I'm nearly famous now  
Still hanging on,still hanging on,hang on  
Six months later I'm a part time waiter,but that didn't last long  
I stretched and squeezed at words I'd never heard to write a song  
And when it finally came,it sounded the same as a tune I'd heard before  
Somehow  
But mama please don't worry about me,I'm nearly famous now  
Still hanging on.still hanging on  

Bah! Ba-ba-ba-Bah! Ba-ba-ba-Bah!  
Bah! Ba-ba-ba-Bah! Ba-ba-ba-Bah!  
  
When the world in which you live in,  
Gets a bit too much to bear,  
And you need someone to lean on,  
When you look, there's no one there  
  
You're gonna find me, out in the country,  
Yeah, you're gonna find me, way out in the country,  
Where the air is good, and the day is fine,  
And the pretty girl, has a hand in mine,  
And the silver stream, is a poor man's wine,  
In the country, in the country  
  
When you're walking in the city,  
And you're feeling rather small,  
And the people on the sidewalk,  
Seem to form a solid wall  
  
You're gonna find me, out in the country,  
Hey, you're gonna find me, way out in the country,  
Where the air is good, and the day is fine,  
And the pretty girl, has a hand in mine,  
And the silver stream, is a poor man's wine,  
In the country, in the country  
  
Hurry, hurry, hurry,  
For the time is slipping by,  
You don't need a ticket,  
It belongs to you and I  
  
Come on an join me, out in the country,  
Where the air is good, and the day is fine,  
And the pretty girl, has a hand in mine,  
And the silver stream, is a poor man's wine,  
In the country, in the country  
  
Bah! Ba-ba-ba-Bah! Ba-ba-ba-Bah!  
Bah! Ba-ba-ba-Bah! Ba-ba-ba-Bah

You waken from a dream  
You step outside  
To find the world is changing  
Under your feet  
Somewhere in the past  
Is the world you knew  
Soon you'll find that freedom  
Is not so sweet  
I can't imagine why you'd throw it all away  
After everything i've said to you today  
When you turn around to find there's  
No one then you finally realize what you've done  
  
In the night when there's no one there at all  
In the night do you hear somebody call  
You see someone and you tell yourself you're wrong  
You hear a voice and you know it must belong  
To the night just a shadow on the wall  
And there's no one there at all  
  
I gave you everything  
Everything i had endlessly  
Believing your love was true  
And you will never know just how it hurt  
To find that you were turning to someone new  
I know that we can't ever change  
What has been said but how can i  
Believe our love is really dead  
When you turn around to find there's no one  
Then you finally realize what you've done  
  
In the night when there's no one there at all  
In the night do you hear somebody call  
You see someone and you tell yourself you're wrong  
You hear a voice and you know it must belong  
To the night just a shadow on the wall  
And there's no one there at all  
-solo-  
And when you turn around to find there's no one  
Then you finally realize what you've done  
In the night...  

Makin' our moves, turnin' the wheel  
Trying to hide the things we feel  
Playin' the game, passin' the blame  
It isn't enough to pretend to make out  
Our hearts are hard in our own hands  
We hold all the cards  
It has to be you, has to be me  
Has to be everyone together  
It has to be you, has to be you  
We're all trying to make it better  
Has to be you, has to be you  
We're so blind that we can't see  
That it has to be you, has to be me  
Isn't it sad, isn't it strange  
We say we need re-arrange  
But never ourselves always somebody else  
Another defence, another excuse  
Pointing the finger where we choose  
We just don't believe it's ourselves we deceive  
It has to be you, has to be me  
Has to be everyone together  
It has to be you, has to be you  
We're all trying to make it better  
Has to be you, has to be you  
We're so blind that we can't see  
That it has to be you, has to be me  
See how we live, each to his own  
Everyone scared to be alone  
Still we go on as tho' nothing was wrong  
It has to be you, has to be me  
Has to be everyone together  
It has to be you, has to be you  
We're all trying to make it better  
Has to be you, has to be you  
We're so blind that we can't see  
That it has to be you, has to be me  

If you hear somebody knockin' on your door  
If you see somebody crawlin' across the floor  
Baby, it'll be me  
Yeah, I'll be lookin' for you  
Well, if you see somebody climbin' up a telegraph pole  
If you find a new lump in your sugar bowl  
Baby, it'll be me  
Yeah, I'll be lookin' for you  
I'm gonna search in the mountains  
Down in the deep blue sea  
I'm gonna search the country side  
And look and look in every tree  
If you find a new bait on your fishin' hook  
And if you find a funny face in your comic book  
Baby, it'll be me  
Yeah, I'll be lookin' for you  
I'm gonna look in the city  
Where the lights are blue  
Gonna search in the forest  
And the haystacks too  
If you see something shootin' out across the stars  
If you see a rocket ship on it's way to Mars  
Baby, it'll be me  
Yeah, I'll be lookin' for you  
Yeah, I'll be lookin' for you  
I'll be lookin' for you

Many a tear has to fall but it's all in the game  
All in the wonderful game that we know as love  
You have words with him and your future's looking dim  
But these things your hearts can rise above  
  
Once in a while he won't call but it's all in the game  
Soon he'll be there at your side with a sweet bouquet  
And he'll kiss your lips and caress your waiting fingertips  
And your heart will fly away  
  
(Soon he'll be there at your side) with a sweet bouquet  
Then he'll kiss your lips and caress your waiting fingertips  
And your heart will fly away

It's no use pretending  
What's done is done  
And you can't turn back the clock  
It's no use pretending  
What you have said  
Will stay inside my head  
Oh it's over  
I tried to please you  
But all you could do  
Was talk behind my back  
Now I see through you  
Nothing I could say or do  
Would get to you  
You've bitten off more than you can chew  
Although I've got to say we're through  
There's nothing I would rather do  
Than be with you  
There's more to you than meets the eye  
I must admit you used to try  
But since you've gone the other way  
Your head is in the sky  

Looking down on a junior cowboy  
I see myself at the end of each day  
I'm feeling sad somehow  
My rumble tumble days are over now  
Took loopy loo to a paper hat party  
And fought the kid who tried to take her away  
I'm feeling sad somehow  
My rumble tumble days are over now  
Running away,you don't know,you don't care  
Funny the way that we change  
Playing spoof at the back of the schoolyard  
With no thought for the rest of the day  
I'm feeling sad somehow  
'cause my rumble tumble days are over now  

Love had ended  
Can't be mended  
All along the line  
I've been true to you  
Even though for some time  
I knew we were through  
I was feeling  
That love had ended  
Can't be mended  
But I can't bear to see you cry  
The feeling's gone  
It's been missing too long  
But I just don't have the heart  
I just don't have the heart to tell you  
It's such a shame  
That it's ended this way  
But I just don't have the heart  
I just don't have the heart to tell you  
There'll be no goodbyes  
There are no words to say  
When you realise  
That I'm far away  
You'll be hurting  
Like I've been hurting  
The truth was burning  
But I just can't say goodbye  
The feeling's gone  
It's been missing too long  
But I just don't have the heart  
I just don't have the heart to tell you  
It's such a shame  
That it's ended this way  
But I just don't have the heart  
I just don't have the heart to tell you  
Ooh but I just don't have the heart  
I just don't have the heart to tell you  
If I stopped to think about  
The good times that we shared  
I could fool myself believing  
That somehow love, love was still there  
Ooh (love, love, love, love, love had ended)  
(love, love, love, love, love had ended)  
I was feeling  
That love had ended  
Can't be mended  
But I can't bear to see you cry  
(repeat chorus)

La Gonave I see your mist  
La Gonave well I know you're kissed  
By the same sea of trouble  
That stretches back home  
La Gonave  
You've got troubles of your own  
  
Yes I got troubles  
Won't you come on and see  
I got my needs just follow me  
But they gonna ease by and by  
If you tell all the people  
That it's no lie  
  
You only came for forty eight hours  
Didn't realize how useless I was  
Came to you for the nation sells lies  
Lord knows but I still feel helpless  
  
La Gonave I don't feel good  
La Gonave do you think I should  
Turn my back and walk away  
La Gonave tell me what to say  
  
If I'd been at home  
Would you telephone me  
I'm situated across the sea  
But it's a small world from any point  
Of view  
Spare a thought  
This could have been you  
  
You shook my senses  
Took my time  
Froze my feeling  
Broke my mind  
La Gonave you've played your part  
La Gonave you sure got heart  
  
Didn't leave my heart in San Francisco  
Didn't want to stay in Omaha  
Never got fooled by New York city  
But I lost my heart to la Gonave  
  
Didn't leave my heart in San Francisco  
Didn't want to stay in Omaha  
Never got fooled by New York city  
But I lost my heart to la Gonave  
  
Didn't leave my heart in San Francisco  
Didn't want to stay in Omaha  
Never got fooled by New York city  
But I lost my heart to la Gonave

The firt step to heaven  
I will take in my life  
I am not afraid when  
I can hold you tight  
If there must be an answer  
Then there must be a prayer  
And you must be the angel  
When you're standing there  
So I lean on you, I lean on you  
  
My life is such a statement  
Of my hopes and despairs  
But nothing really matters  
Just as long as you're there  
You love me such honesty,  
You love with no gain  
You speak to me so tender  
And you never explain  
So I lean on you, I lean on you  
My baby she cares  
It's so easy to do  
My baby she tells me what to do  
She always tells me the truth  
My baby she cares  
It's so easy to do  
My baby knows what I'm gonna do  
That's why I lean on you  
  
I dream of an island,  
Of a fantasy place  
Where I can go to sometimes  
And no one can trace  
Well such is the nature,  
The nature of love  
That when we dream it  
Sometimes means that we need love  
So I lean on you, I lean on you  
My baby she cares  
It's so easy to do  
My baby she tells me what to do  
She always tells me the truth  
My baby she cares  
It's so easy to do  
My baby knows what I'm gonna do  
That's why I'm gonna lean on you  
  
So I lean on you, I lean on you  
I lean on you, so I lean on you  
my baby she cares, it's so easy to do  
my baby knows what I'm gonna do,  
that's why I'm gonna lean on you  
whooo oooh oooh oooh(repeat chorus)  
my baby she loves me  
whooo oooh oooh

Billy on his way to school  
Didn't care too much about the teachers and rules  
But he had a plan he said he'd try it one day  
One he knew would leave them all with nothing to say  
He had a friend who said he'd teach him how to rock and roll  
After school when he was feelin' good  
He'd go home and do the things that he understood  
He would rock in the kitchen and roll in the hall  
And Billy's mother said you got no sense at all  
But we know too well that he was  
Learning how to rock and roll  
  
Cause he would rock in the kitchen roll in the hall  
Stand on the tv and climb up the wall  
Jive on the ceiling lay on the floor  
Crawl through the bathroom and cry out for more  
And that's the only way to do it  
When you're learning how to rock and roll  
Teach me to rock...  
  
Willy turns to the mirror and gives his hair a flip  
He would mime to Elvis and curl his lip  
Ha ha in the kitchen  
Ha ha in the hall  
Willy's mother said you got no sense at all  
But we know too well that he was  
Learning how to rock and roll  
  
Cause he would rock in the kitchen roll in the hall  
Stand on the tv and climb up the wall  
Jive on the ceiling lay on the floor  
Crawl through the bathroom and cry out for more  
And that's the only way to do it  
When you're learning how to rock and roll  
Teach me to rock...  
  
He learnt to rock and roll  
And sing the blues  
He learnt to head shake  
While singing blue suede shoes  
He learnt a hand clap  
Off the beat  
And at the gig he had them out of their seats  
It's the only way to do it so long live rock and roll  
  
Cause he would rock in the kitchen roll in the hall  
Stand on the tv and climb up the wall  
Jive on the ceiling lay on the floor  
Crawl through the bathroom and cry out for more  
And that's the only way to do it  
When you're learning how to rock and roll  
Teach me to rock...

First you cuddle up beside me nice and near  
Then you whisper all the things I long to hear  
That's the first lessson in love  
Mmmm...Give me your heart  
Then you put your two sweet lips on mine like this  
And you'll learn the magic of a tender kiss  
That's the next lesson in love  
Mmmm....lesson in love  
It's so easy when you know how  
O my darling let me show you now  
Last you whisper I love you so sweetly  
Then I'll know you've learned it all completely  
That's the last lesson in love  
Mmmm...baby love me true  
  
  

Oooooo... Somewhere over the rainbow, Way up high. There's a land that I heard
of, Once in a lullaby. Somewhere over the rainbow, Skies are blue. And the
dreams that you dare to dream, Really do come true. Someday I'll wish upon a
star, And wake up where the clouds are far behind me. Where troubles melt like
lemon drops, High above the chimney tops. That's where you'll find me.
Somewhere over the rainbow, Bluebirds fly. They fly over the rainbow, Why then
- oh, why can't I? I see trees of green, red roses too. I watch them bloom for
me and you. And I think to myself, What a wonderful world. Well, I see skies
of blue and I see clouds of white. The brightness of day and light, darkness
of night. And I think to myself, What a wonderful world. The colours of the
rainbow, so pretty in the sky, Are also on the faces of people passin' by. I
see friends shakin' hands, saying "How do you do!" They're really sayin' "I
love you." I hear babies cry and I watch them grow. They'll learn much more
than I'll ever know. And I think to myself, What a wonderful world. Someday
I'll wish upon a star, And wake up where the clouds are far behind me. Where
troubles melt like lemon drops, High above the chimney tops. That's where
you'll find me. Somewhere over the rainbow, Way up high. Birds fly over the
rainbow, Why then - oh, why can't I? Oooooo...

There's a girl down a lonely street,  
Breaking hearts seven days a week.  
She got an look in her eye,  
For a red-blooded guy like me.  
I'm breaking out in a cold cold sweat,  
And I'm in a kind of rush to get to...  
  
Little Mistreater,  
You know it when you meet her,  
Little Mistreater,  
Yeah, that's her name.  
  
Treating love like a game  
I'm so scared when she calls my name,  
This kind of girl drives a man insane.  
You give her all that you can,  
She raps on your door again.  
I need some time just to catch my breath,  
Tell me honey do I past your test.  
The Little Mistreater,  
You know it when you meet her.  
Little Mistreater,  
Yeah, that's her name.  
  
She's an old flame  
  
(Tell me now) Somebody tell me  
(Somebody) What to do when your  
Love won't leave, (heart won't leave)  
I can almost hear the sad goodbyes,  
When I see her walking down the street.  
  
There she goes.  
  
The Little Mistreater,  
You know it when you meet her,  
Little Mistreater,  
You know it when you meet her,  
Yeah, that's her name  
  
Playing the game  
  
Just, just, just....Little Mistreater  
(Every day she's got guys on a string)  
Little Mistreater  
(She's a girl don't have to do anything)  
Little Mistreater (repeated......)

O little town of Bethlehem,  
How still we see thee lie,  
Above the deep and dreamless sleep,  
The silent stars go by.  
Yet in the dark streets shineth,  
The everlasting light,  
The hopes and fears of all the years,  
Are met in thee tonight.  
How silently, how silently,  
The wondrous gift is given.  
So God imparts to human hearts,  
The blessings of His heaven.  
We hear the Christmas angels.  
The great glad tidings tell,  
O come to us, abide with us,  
The Lord Emmanuel.  
No ear may hear His coming.  
But in this world of sin,  
Where meek souls will receive Him still,  
The dear Christ enters in.

Got myself a cryin', talkin', sleepin', walkin', livin' doll  
Gonna do my best to please her just 'cause she's a livin' doll  
Got a roamin' eye and that is why she satisfies my soul  
Got myself a cryin', sleepin', walkin', livin' doll  
  
BRIDGE:  
  
Take a look at her hair, it's real  
If you don't believe what I say, just feel  
I'm gonna lock her up in a trunk so no big hunk  
Can steal her away from me  
  
REPEAT VERSE

Your love is like a prison wall  
And it's getting higher  
I get so far and then I fall  
I can't get through the wire  
  
Oh oh oh I'm locked inside your prison  
Oh oh oh I'm locked inside your prison  
  
It's as though I'm doing time  
And you won't free me  
Let the punishment befit the crime  
And say you need me  
  
Oh oh oh I'm locked inside your prison  
Oh oh oh I'm locked inside your prison  
  
Save me save me can't you see I'm innocent  
Turn the key that will set me free  
Please let it end oh let it end  
  
Oh oh oh I'm locked inside your prison  
Oh oh oh I'm locked inside your prison  
  
Save me save me can't you see I'm innocent  
Turn the key that will set me free  
Please let it end won't you let it end  
  
I'll dig a tunnel to your heart  
Let me remind you  
Even gonna tear the walls apart  
Until I find you  
  
Oh oh oh I'm locked inside your prison  
Oh oh oh I'm locked inside your prison

Tomorrow never comes when you are looking foward to it  
You try so hard to live the day your way  
But what a life if you could live the way you want it  
You tried it once before but it didn't work out  
You know you need someone to bring out the best in you  
To be a light to you is what I intend to do  
To show the way you know you ought to go  
You'll see a world that will surely come into view  
So take the hand that I offer to you  
To see the truth that you will be no longer  
Lost, lost in a lonely world (lost and lonely)  
'cause I can see that there's life in your eyes  
If only you would realise  
That now you don't have to settle for this  
(you don't have to settle for this)  
You don't have to say "there's nowhere to go"  
You can find out anything you really wanna know  

Magic is the moonlight  
On this lover's dream night  
As I see the moonlight  
Shining in your eyes  
  
Can't resist their power  
In this moon lit hour  
Love being any flower  
This is paradise  
  
Living in the splendor  
Of your kiss so tender  
Makes my heart surrender  
To your love divine  
  
Magic is the moonlight  
More than any dream night  
Magic is the moonlight  
For it made you mine  
  
Living in the splendor  
Of your kiss so tender  
Makes my heart surrender  
To your love divine  
  
Magic is the moonlight  
More than any dream night  
Magic is the moonlight  
For it made you mine  
  
Magic is the moonlight  
For it made you mine

Tonight there's a magic that i can't explain  
Tune-up and start the show all set now ready to go  
This band's gonna really rock tonight  
Steppin' out upon the stage  
Under those lights again  
We're gonna shake the place tonight  
They gotta new song high in the charts you know  
You must have heard them play it on the radio  
When that flat top starts that picking  
Hear the bass drum start that kicking  
The joint is really jumpin' now  
Ooh mama it's so exiting to feel  
That tension rising when they turn the house lights down  
It's a strange kinda magic that never seems to age  
Makin' history  
Makin' history  
Adding a new leaf to the story that is rock'n'roll  
Makin' history  
Makin' history  
Playing a new beat to the glory  
That is rock'n'roll  
Rock on  
They gotta new song  
High in the charts you know  
You must have heard them play it on the radio  
Hear the start and the jumbo gibson  
You don't know what you're missing if you're not  
Painting the town tonight  
Ooh mama it's so exiting to feel  
That tension rising when they turn the house lights down  
Makin' history  
Makin' history  
Adding a new leaf to the story that is rock'n'roll  
Makin' history  
Makin' history  
Playing a new beat to the glory  
That is rock'n'roll  
Makin' history  
Makin' history  
Adding a new leaf to the story that is rock'n'roll  
Makin' history  
Makin' history  
Playing a new beat to the glory that is rock'n'roll  
Mama it's so exiting-oh oh  
Don't you find the beat exiting

How can I bear this? show me  
How can I survive  
Trapped in your madness  
With no hope of release? oh -  
Do I just wait for  
Your demons to arrive?  
Blaming me for your ills  
While you rest in peace  
You are marked with death  
By your cruel lies  
You deserve all this  
You betrayed me  
With your final breath  
You will still despise  
Every tear or kiss  
You betrayed me  
I shall not be tricked  
Into pity for  
You must know full well  
That I love you  
And you can't inflict  
Any pain that's more  
Than this living hell  
But I love you  
I see the eyes that deceived  
Poor wasted hands growing cold  
No lover's comfort  
No belief to hold  
You have killed yourself  
Yours the infernal  
Original sin  
Mine the misfortune  
Of your heartless caprice - oh -  
Do I just wait for  
All your devils to move in?  
Blaming me for your death  
While you rest in peace  
I am marked for life  
And the peace I crave  
Is a fool's conceit  
I am branded  
And you'll twist the knife  
From beyond the grave  
And I fall, retreat  
Empty handed  
I shall not be tricked  
Into pity for  
You must know full well  
That I love you  
And you can't inflict  
Any pain that's more  
Than this living hell  
But I love you  
I see the eyes that betrayed  
Poor wasted hands growing cold  
No lover's comfort  
No belief to hold  
You are marked with death  
How can I convince you  
That you broke your own heart?  
How can I forgive you  
For the murderous part  
You played in destroying  
Your love and your life  
And mine ...  
I shall not be tricked  
Into pity for  
You must know full well  
That I love you  
And you can't inflict  
Any pain that's more  
Than this living hell  
But I love you  
I see the eyes that deceived  
Poor wasted hands growing cold  
No lover's comfort  
No belief to hold  
I am marked for life  
You are marked with death ...  

Well, you stand there honey, with you hands on your hips  
Well, its stoppin your feeling, baby, button your lips

Uh uh baby, you got a mean streak  
Well, if you wanna stay with me, be my lovin honey  
You must lose your mean streak  
  
You look so cute and you walk so nice  
Oh but your hide is as mean and as cold as ice  
Well, I found my heart, it was a big kind of faster  
And I know I was living in disaster  
  
Uh uh honey, you got a mean streak  
Uh uh baby, you got a mean streak  
Well, if you wanna stay with me, be my lovin honey  
You must lose your mean streak  
  
Well, youre standing there honey, and youre looking so pretty  
Well, I'm gonna leave you standing there in a pity  
Well, you took my love and you threw it away  
And I know whats gonna happen to you someday  
  
Uh uh honey, you got a mean streak  
Uh uh baby, you got a mean streak  
Well, if you wanna stay with me, be my lovin honey  
You must lose your mean streak  
  
Yeah, mean streak  
Oh baby, mean streak  
Oh honey, mean streak  
Oh, mean streak

Five days a week I'm just abiding my time  
Fill in the hours till the weekend's mine  
All day long I've got my radio on  
Keeps me going till my work is done  
Monday through to Friday  
Nothing goes my way  
Just working staying alive  
Monday through to Sunday  
There's only one day  
Saturday is rock 'n' roll time  
Work for the man just to get my pay  
Too many hours in the working day  
Dead on my feet but I need the cash  
Roll on Saturday make it fast  
Monday through to Friday  
Nothing goes my way  
Just working staying alive  
Monday through to Sunday  
There's only one day  
Saturday is rock 'n' roll time  
I pay my dues to the union man  
Don't get too heavy, that's the way I am  
I live for rock 'n' roll and Saturday night  
I hear the music and I feel alright, feel alright  
Monday through to Friday  
Nothing goes my way  
Just working staying alive  
Monday through to Sunday  
There's only one day  
Saturday is rock 'n' roll time  

Moon river, wider than a mile.  
I'm crossin' you in style some day.  
Old dream maker, you heartbreaker.  
Wherever you're goin', I'm goin' your way.  
Two drifters, off to see the world.  
There's such a lot of world to see.  
We're after the same rainbow's end, waitin' 'round the bend.  
My huckleberry friend, Moon River, and me.  
Two drifters, off to see the world.  
There's such a lot of world to see.  
We're after the same rainbow's end, waitin' 'round the bend.  
My huckleberry friend, Moon River, and me.

Free to turn like the wind on a summer day  
Heart worn, like a ring around the moon  
And your eyes are ablaze, reflections of time passing by  
That remind you there's much more to life than standing still  
  
Or running from place to place in the heat of the day  
Just follow your heart and you'll see, there's more to life  
  
There beyond the horizon, there's another day  
Far above the pain and fear you feel  
The power and the peace, the greatest sensation of all  
There is much more to life than you'll ever know, the rise and fall  
  
There'll always be you and me, we're moving as one  
So follow your heart and you'll see, there's more to life  
  
We all have our dreams, we all have our visions  
But time after time, we're faced with decisions  
Which road to follow? How hard to fight?  
Then you wake up and see that there's much more to life  
  
Free in acres of sky on a summer day  
Fire that burns with hope inside your heart  
We are never apart, reflections of time passing by  
That remind you there's much more to life  
  
So just follow your heart and you'll see  
If you follow your heart you'll be free  
'Cause there's more to life, more to life

I'm thinking 'bout moving in,  
Commit myself to you, forget where I've been,  
I'm thinking thinking 'bout moving in,  
I'm thinking 'bout making my stand,  
And I know I could do it,  
If you give me your hand,  
I'm thinking 'bout making my stand  
Making my stand,  
You changed my world,  
And you stood in my doorway,  
You changed my life,  
When you stepped into my mind,  
Used to think that there was no future before me,  
Now you say that I can leave my past behind  
Now you say that I can leave my past behind  
Behind  
Don't understand why you do what you do  
You keep giving your love,  
We give nothing to you,  
You keep giving your love,  
We give nothing to you,  
Used to think that there was no future before me,  
Now you say that I can leave my past behind  
Now you say that I can leave my past behind  
Behind  
Don't understand why you do what you do  
You keep giving your love,  
We give nothing to you,  
You keep giving your love,  
We give nothing to you,  
  
Here I am thinking 'bout moving in,  
Making my stand,  
Here I am thinking 'bout moving in,  
Making my stand.

Itemise the things you  
Covet as you squander  
Through your life.  
Bigger cars, bigger  
Houses, term insurance  
For your wife.  
Tuesday evenings with your harlot,  
And on Wednesdays it's  
Your charlatan analyst,  
He's high upon your list.  
You got air conditioned  
Sinuses and dark, disturbing doubts  
About religion.  
And you keep those cards  
And letters going out.  
And while your  
Secretary's tempting you  
Your morals are exepting  
You from guilt and shame,  
Heaven knows  
You're not to blame!  
You better take care of  
Business, Mr. Businessman,  
What's your plan?  
Get down to business,  
Mr. Businessman, if you can  
Before it's too late,  
And they throw your life away.  
Did you see your children  
Growing up today,  
And did you hear the  
Music of their laughter  
As they set about to play?  
And did you smell the  
Fragrance of those roses  
In your garden?  
Did the morning sunlight  
Warm your soul and  
Brighten up your day?  
Do you qualify to be  
Alive or is the limit  
Of your senses  
So as only to survive?  
Spending counterfeit  
Incentive, wasting  
Precious time and health.  
Placing values on the  
Worthless, disregarding  
Priceless wealth.  
Well, you can wheel and  
Deal the best of them  
And steal it from the rest of them.  
You know the score,  
Their ethics are a bore.  
86 proof anesthetic crutches  
Brought you to the top  
Where the smiles are all synthetic  
And the ulcers never stop  
When they take that final inventory  
Yours will be the same  
Sad story everywhere -  
No one will really care. no one more lonely than  
This rich important man.  
Let's have your autograph  
ENDORSE your epitaph!  
You better take care...  
................if you can!  
  

Ooh I'd like to tell you something that's playing on my mind  
I don't know how to tell you, so I'll take my time  
I believe, I believe it's not just in my mind  
Something I'm dreaming to take up the time  
There's no escape - I don't want to be free  
I believe that it must be love  
Having trouble sleeping, you're always on my mind  
When it comes to dreamin' I get left behind  
I believe, I believe there's no doubt in my mind  
There's no use pretending I'm hooked on your line  
Words of the heart don't come easy to me  
I believe that it must be love  
You got me tied to a railroad track  
Your love's the train - there's no turning it back  
I've told you how I feel, I've laid it on the line  
Got to take your love and make you feel that you're mine  
I believe, I believe it's not just in my mind  
Something I'm dreaming to take up the time  
There's no escape - I don't want to be free  
I believe that it must be love  
It must be love  
It must be love yeah etc..  

The night is like a lovely tune  
Beware my foolish heart  
How white the ever constant moon  
Take care my foolish heart  
  
There's a line between love and fascination  
That's hard to see, how many names such as this  
For they both have the very same sensation  
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss  
  
Her lips are much too close to mine  
Beware my foolish heart  
But should our eager lips combine  
Then let the fire start  
  
For this time it isn't fascination  
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart  
It's love, this time it's love  
My foolish heart

Right from early days from the moment I was born  
I would take my guitar in the early early mornin'  
And go down to the fields and play-ay-ay  
Sittin' down there in the long grass strummin'  
I could see the people from miles around comin'  
To hear me sing my music and play-ay-ay  
Well that's been my kinda life my kinda life  
(Yes and I like it)  
Well that's been my kinda life my kinda life  
(Yes and I like it)  
Well that's been my kinda life yeah and I wouldn't spend it anywhere  
Other than sittin' down somewhere playin' away my days  
Well we made it to the city just me and my guitar  
That was where I found a freaky little bar  
I sat there on the stage and play-ay-ayed  
Well up came a guy who said it wasn't plastic  
He wanted me to sing away my life or something drastic  
But all I want to do is play-ay-ay  
Well that's been my kinda life my kinda life  
(Yes and I like it)  
Well that's been my kinda life my kinda life  
(Yes and I like it)  
Well that's been my kinda life yeah and I wouldn't spend it anywhere  
Other than sittin' down somewhere playin' away my days  
Well fame and fortune I've let them pass me by  
No one in the country could say I didn't try  
To turn the people and to play-ay-ay  
You can keep all the money and the places that go with it  
'Cause all I want is freedom and no cash could ever get it  
All I want to do is play-ay-ay  
Well that's been my kinda life my kinda life  
(Yes and I like it)  
Well that's been my kinda life my kinda life  
(Yes and I like it)  
Well that's been my kinda life yeah and I wouldn't spend it anywhere  
Other than sittin' down somewhere playin' away my days

[Chorus: ]  
The chances you gave me  
A definite maybe  
But luck she's a lady, stayed  
She played for me  
  
There's gold in the mountain  
Good fortune for countin'  
Three coins in the fountain  
And my luck won't change  
  
Take dust from the coalmine  
Make dust from the goldmine  
King Midas you're sidelined  
And my luck won't change no my luck remains  
  
[Chorus: ]  
  
No point in shouting,  
Whoever there was doubting,  
I'm at the top of the mountain  
And my luck won't change  
  
The stock market read it  
The rumors they spread it  
And I meant it when I said it  
That my luck won't change  
No, my luck remains  
  
That old lover lost me  
She spent and she cost me  
My new love has taught me  
That my luck won't change  
(my luck won't change, my luck remains)  
  
[Chorus: ]  
  
The offer she made me  
Was more than just maybe  
But luck who's a lady stayed  
She played for me  
  
[Repeat: 1st verse]  
  
[Chorus: ]  
  
My temperature's rising  
No point in disguising  
The phoenix is arising  
And my luck won't change, no it just remains

Well, I've dreamed about today.  
The same dream in many ways.  
But I never thought I'd be here,  
Be here with you, my pretty one.  
  
Well, I've searched the whole world through.  
To find someone who,  
Would make this dream come true.  
It's you and only you, my pretty one.  
  
[Chorus]  
Pretty one, I long to hold you.  
Through the night, I want to hold you.  
Pretty one, has no one told you,  
I love you.  
Any day and you will find me,  
Full of joy when you're beside me.  
In a moment like this,  
Could it be what I've missed all my life.  
  
Well, I've dreamed about today.  
The same dream in so many ways.  
But nothing can compare with,  
Compare with you, my pretty one.  
  
Well, I love your smile.  
And I love your eyes.  
And the way you talk, makes me feel so nice.  
Nothing can compare with the way you are.  
And I need you now, as I write this song.  
Did I hear you say you're the only woman,  
From a lonely prayer I am in the air.  
  
Well, I've dreamed about today.  
The same dream in so many ways.  
But nothing can compare with,  
Compare with you my pretty one.  
But I never thought I'd be here,  
Be here with you my pretty one.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well, I've dreamed about today.  
The same dream in so many ways.  
But nothing can compare with,  
Compare with you my pretty one.  
No nothing can compare with,  
Compare with you my pretty one.

There'll never be anyone else but you for me  
Never ever be just couldn't be  
Anyone else but you  
  
If I could take my pick of all the girls  
I've ever known  
Then I'd come and pick you out to be my very own  
  
There'll never be anyone else but you for me  
Never ever be just couldn't be  
Anyone else but you  
  
I never will forget the way you kissed me  
And when we're not together I wonder if you miss me  
'Cause I hope and I pray the day will come  
When you belong to me then I am gonna prove to you  
How true my love can be  
  
I never will forget the way you kissed me  
And when we're not together I wonder if you miss me  
cause I hope and I pray the day will come  
When you'll belong to me  
'Cause then I'm gonna prove to you

Never even thougt it would happen to me  
Maybe I've been blind  
Only others can see I'm in love  
What am I to do. can I let it show  
Do I keep it to myself  
Or should I let her know I'm in love  
Do I nurse it in my heart  
Hold it back in my eyes  
Hide it all inside  
Or put on a disguise I'm in love  
Have I gotta play games  
Even suffer the pain  
Let the secret out  
Even suffer the doubt I'm in love  
I know it's all there  
I really wanna share my life  
With someone else  
Will she feel the same  
What am I to do.can I let it show  
Do I keep it to myself  
Or should I let her know I'm in love  
It isn't so easy when you've broken before  
But it isn't so hard when you're ready for more  
Could you love me  
Give me a simple clue  
Anything will do  
So long as I know  
What's in me is in you  
Could you love me  
I've got so much of care to give away  
There's only one thing I wanna hear you say  
I love you...  
Have I gotta play games  
Even suffer the pain  
Let the secret out  
Even suffer the doubt I'm in love  
I know it's all there  
I really wanna share my life  
With someone else  
Will she feel the same  

I've had my chances, too many nights  
All these broken dreams, they're just drifting away  
But I'd do it all again, just to hear, hear you say  
  
[Chorus]  
Never let never let you go  
I will never let never let you go  
I will never let never let you go  
  
Everyone tells me I'm a fool to myself  
But I never listen to a word that they say  
'cause I've heard it a million times before  
And I'd give everything away if you will say  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Never ever let  
Tell me that you'll never let you go  
Say you'll not leave me baby  
  
Never let  
Never ever let you go  
I will never let  
Never let you go

You look so sad like you lost your only friend.  
Don't feel so bad  
You can always try again.  
So don't hide  
Go seek  
Don't let the grass grow under your feet.  
Get out  
Get up  
Get on  
Get moving out  
  
Don't surrender  
Don't give up the fight.  
You give a little bit more  
If you want her back it's a full attack  
  
You give a little bit more.  
If you want to win  
You don't give in  
You give a little bit more.  
When you think you're through what you got to do is give a little bit more.  
She said good-bye  
So you tell yourself that's all.  
But your hands ain't tied why you make yourself so small.  
  
So don't hide  
Go seek  
Don't let the grass grow under your feet. . . .  
Don't give up the fight  
Got to keep on going with all your might  
  
Try hard  
Don't stop. Got to keep on giving it all you got.  
Never give up  
Never give up  
Never say die.  
Believe in I  
  
You can reach the top  
Got to give it a shot.  
Don't say no  
Got to get in the flow.  
So don't hide  
Go seek  
Don't crawl away  
  
Get back on your feet.  
Get out  
Get up  
Get on  
Get moving out.  
  
Don't surrender  
Don't give up the fight.  
You give a little bit more.  
And if you want her back it's a full attack  
You give a little bit more.  
If you want to win you don't give in  
You give a little bit more.  
When you think you're through what you got to do is give a little bit more  
You give a little bit more  
You give a little bit more

Nine times out of ten, baby, I've told you  
And I aint gonna tell you just nine times again  
Aah, just how much I aim to hold you  
Again and again and again  
  
Little girl, its nine times out of ten, you've refused me  
And then say that you refuse me nine times again  
But I wont stop until you choose me  
Again and again and again  
  
(Well,) don't try to fight it  
Cause its no use  
Youre gonna find that  
I'm stubborn as a doggone mule  
  
Nine times out of ten I've tried to kiss you  
And I aint trying just nine times again  
Well, if I missed the nine times that I've tried, baby  
Ill bet my life, Ill get you on number ten  
  
(instr break)  
  
Well, don't try to fight it  
Come, baby, it ain't no use  
Youre gonna find that  
I'm stubborn as a doggone mule  
  
Nine times out of ten I've tried to kiss you  
And I aint trying just nine times again  
Well, if I missed the nine times that I've tried, baby  
Ill bet my life, Ill get you on number ten

I don't know how to love you.  
Where do I begin.  
It helplessness is sinning  
Then here I am a sinner  
Guilty of sin.  
  
I don't know how to help you  
Your trouble goes so deep  
You're about to lose your life  
And here I am dejected  
Cause I love a night of sleep.  
  
Love one another you said  
Come together as one.  
I'm just a servant, Lord  
Yet you made me a son  
Sometimes I'm troubled  
By the things you make me see.  
But no matter how I feel, Lord  
Here am I send me.  
  
So I leave the world behind me  
And enter this domain.  
I'm staggered by the gulf  
Between us.  
I can see your sickness  
But I don't feel your pain.  
  
Pity's got no power  
Compassion has the heart  
Jesus, keep me mindful  
That it's you who does the  
Giving.  
And it's we who need to  
Play our part.

Across the wet November night  
The church is bright with candlelight  
And waiting Evensong, (2x)  
A single bell with plaintive strokes  
Pleads louder than the stirring oaks  
The leafless lanes along. (2x)  
  
It calls the choirboys from their tea  
And villagers, the two or three,  
Damp down the kitchen fire (2x)  
Let out the cat, and up the lane  
Go paddling through the gentle rain  
Of misty Oxfordshire (2x)  
  
On country morning sharp and clear  
The penitent in faith draw near  
And kneeling here below (2x)  
Partake the heavenly banquet spread  
Of sacramental Wine and Bread  
And Jesus' presence know (2x)  
  
And must that plaintive bell in vain  
Plead loud along the dripping lane?  
And must the building fall? (2x)  
Not while we love the church and live  
And of our charity will give  
Our much, our more, our all (2x)

(On my word)  
There will never be anyone but you child  
(On my word)  
No one else will ever do but you  
(On my word)  
I will never stay from your side  
And someday youre gonna be my bride  
(On my word)  
They say Im the cheatin guy  
They say looking girl youll find someone new  
So someone new keeps in my heart  
But dont believe them cause I know  
That deep inside they love you too, honey  
(Repeat the 1st verse)  
  
Umm, they say that I am no good  
They say that I never would stand by you  
So someday when youre givin me  
But dont believe them cause I know  
That deep inside they love you too, honey  
(Repeat the 1st verse again)

I can think of nothing better  
Than dancing on the beach  
See a girl, you can go and get her  
Your troubles will be out of reach  
  
On the beach  
You can dance to a rock 'n' roll  
On the beach  
Hear the Bossa Nova, played with soul  
On the beach  
You can dance, twist and shout  
On the beach  
Everybody hear me come on out  
On the beach  
Come on, everybody, stomp your feet)  
On the beach  
You can dance with anyone you meet)  
'Cause your troubles are out of reach  
On the beach  
  
Umm, this is fun  
Umm, won't you tell me  
I'm the one you're gonna dance with  
Yeah, Bossa Nova!  
  
Umm, this is fun  
Umm, now I know  
I'm the one you're gonna dance with  
Yeah, twist and shout now!  
  
You can do the dance that you want to  
With anyone that you meet  
And if the Bossa Nova doesn't get you  
The twist will have you on you feet  
  
On the beach  
You can dance to a rock 'n' roll  
On the beach  
Hear the Bossa Nova, played with soul  
On the beach  
You can dance, twist and shout  
On the beach  
Everybody hear me come on out  
On the beach  
Come on, everybody, stomp your feet  
On the beach  
You can dance with anyone you meet  
'Cause your troubles are out of reach  
On the beach

This love has two stories  
One yours and one sublime  
This love has two beginnings  
One mine and one unkind  
This love has one pretender  
This love is to remember  
This love had two stories  
Must end with once upon a time  
There were two strangers  
And in time, the strangers met  
And fell in love with time  
In oh such danger  
And time, does not forget  
In the meantime,  
That's the way it goes.  
Meanwhile, once upon a time  
In the meantime, meanwhile  
This love has two meanings  
One sure and one to find  
This love has true feelings  
One yearning, one is blind  
This love should not surrender  
This love is to remember  
This love with two meanings  
Must end with once upon a time  
There were two strangers  
And in time, the strangers met  
And fell in love with time  
In oh such danger  
And time, does not forget  
In the meantime,  
that's the way it goes.  
Meanwhile, once upon a time  
In the meantime, meanwhile,  
That's the way it goes.  
Once upon a time  
In the meantime  
This love has one pretender  
This love will always remember  
This love with two stories  
Must end with once upon a time  
There were two strangers  
And in time, the strangers met  
And fell in love with time  
In oh such danger  
And time, does not forget  
In the meantime,  
That's the way it goes.  
Meanwhile, once upon a time  
This love had one pretender  
That's the way it goes  
This love will always be mine  
This love was once upon a time  
This love had one pretender  
That's the way it goes  
That's the way it has to be  
This love will always be mine  
Always you, always me  
This love had one pretender  
That's the way it goes  
The way its gotta be

Our day will come  
And we'll have everything  
We'll share the joy  
Falling in love can bring, yeah  
No one can tell me  
That I'm too young to know  
That I love you so  
And you love me  
Oh, our day will come  
If we just wait a while  
No more tears for us  
Just think love and wear a smile  
Our dreams have magic because  
We'll always stay in love this way  
'Cause our day, day, our day  
Our day is gonna come  
So how long, baby  
It's gonna come  
Wait a minute, baby  
It's gonna come  

Someone else is in your arms tonight  
While I'm all alone and blue  
Someone else would kiss and hold you tight  
Just the way I used to do  
  
I used to be your love  
And now I'm your used to be  
Outsider, that's me  
You'll be dancing cheek to cheek with him  
  
To our favorite melody  
And the tender words you speak to him  
Will be words you spoke to me  
Once I was in your heart  
  
Now someone else holds the key  
Outsider that's me  
I want you so much, so much  
I can look you can look, but musn't touch  
  
I keep waiting for the phone to ring  
But I know it's all in vain  
When you left me you took everything  
But the memories and the pain  
  
I used to be your love

Don't want to be left behind left alone  
Waiting for you to call me  
Don't want to have best of times haunting me  
Underlining my heartache  
Time heals but only time will tell if time heals  
Leaving me free of the hold that you have on me  
Over you how can I get  
Over you must forget  
The things you do  
I just must get  
Over you live my life again  
Without you here  
I talk to your answer phone it's telling me  
Please leave your number  
I'll call when I get back home  
When you hear the tone speak up and clearly  
Time heals but only time will tell if time heals  
But who do I turn to if you won't return my calls  
Over you how can I get  
Over you must forget  
The things you do  
I just must get  
Over you live my life again  
Without you here  
I call your home and your answer phone  
Tells me leave your number  
Over you how can I get  
Over you must forget  
The things you do  
I just must get  
Over you live my life again  
Without you here  
Over you I just must get  
Over you but how will I get  
Over you I guess I'll get  
Over you it may take some time getting  
Over you I may never get  
Over you just must get  
Over you...

Go swiftly  
The flags and drums can hypnotise  
When glory has faded the dream  
Is worth more than the prize  
A twisting turning flame  
And a freedom burning bright  
Knows all of the names  
And all of the games  
Of the yellow, black and white  
We've gotta have faith  
To work it out  
Faith and hope  
Without any doubt  
Give us strength to make a start  
Put a song in our hearts...  
We're never gonna break down these walls  
And build a prison with a stone  
Cause you know what love is worth  
We're gonna build a heaven on earth  
We're running in the wheels of fortune  
Turning water into wine  
We're gonna take love and make it shine  
We're gonna find peace in our time  
Softly, softly  
When there is lightning in the sky  
When the rivers are rising and  
Trouble rolls in on the tide  
We'll keep on keeping on  
'Til all the tears are dry  
We'll weather the storm  
Welcome the dawn  
Of tomorrow you and I  
We've gotta have faith  
And get it fast  
Faith and hope  
And make it last  
Give us strength  
To reach the stars  
Put a song in our hearts  
We're never gonna break down these walls  
And build a prison with a stone  
Cause you know what love is worth  
We're gonna build a heaven on earth  
We're running in the wheels of fortune  
Turning water into wine  
We're gonna take love and make it shine  
We're gonna find peace in our time  
We're raisin' the dust  
It's heaven or bust  
And we'll see this dream come true  
We're gonna have faith (faith)  
The road will be long  
But there's hope (hope)  
To carry us on  
We'll have strength (strength)  
We'll never go wrong  
With this song in our hearts  
We're never gonna break down these walls  
And build a prison with a stone  
Cause you know what love is worth  
We're gonna build a heaven on earth  
We're running in the wheels of fortune  
Turning water into wine  
We're gonna take love and make it shine  
We're gonna find peace in our time  
At the sign (sign)  
Of the dove  
Is gonna shine (shine)  
On a wing  
And a prayer  
We'll be fine  
Fine  
Fine  
We're never gonna break down these walls  
And build a prison with a stone  
Cause you know what love is worth  
We're gonna build a heaven on earth  
We're running in the wheels of fortune  
Turning water into wine  
We're gonna take love and make it shine  
We're gonna find peace in our time

I know that you're with him just now as I write  
I know you need someone to hold you at night  
But I'm begging you, baby  
Please don't fall in love  
I knew it might happen when I was away  
And now that it's happened, I just want to say  
That I'm begging you, baby  
Please don't fall in love  
I'm usually strong but I'm feeling so weak  
It wells up inside me, I cry when I speak  
But the more I call you on the phone  
The more I feel alone  
And the less we have to say  
I know that you're with him just now as I write  
I know you need someone to hold you at night  
But I'm begging you, baby  
Please don't fall in love  
I knew it might happen when I was away  
And now that it's happened, I just want to say  
That I'm begging you, baby  
Please don't fall in love  
We kissed at the airport, we said we could wait  
I believe it is we who determine our fate  
And I love you more than I can say  
Don't throw it all away  
Don't let it go by  
I know that you're with him just now as I write  
I know you need someone to hold you at night  
But I'm begging you, baby  
Please don't fall in love  
I know you don't tell me, to spare me the pain  
Don't want you to tell me, I don't need his name  
That I'm begging you, baby  
Please don't fall in love
