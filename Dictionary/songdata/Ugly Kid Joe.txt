Pray by the candle and I hope to see light  
Wait for the moment but it's never right  
So now I'm sailing on the oceans so wide  
I'm all alone, me and my daydreams and I  
Pray by the candle and I hope to see light  
Wait for the moment but it's never right  
So I'm the captain my ship's got a hole in the side  
I'm all alone, me and my daydreams at night  
Can you see me walking through the trees  
Can you hear me laughing in the breeze  
Can you see me walking through the trees  
Can you hear me laughing in the breeze  
Pray by the candle and I hope to see light  
Wait for the moment but it's never right  
Across the water I watch my ship waves goodbye  
I'm all alone me and my daydreams at night

My child arrived just the other day  
Came to the world in the usual way  
But there were planes to catch and bills to pay  
He learned to walk while I was away  
He was talkin' 'fore I knew it  
And as he grew he said,  
'I'm gonna be like you, Dad,  
You know I'm gonna be like you.'  
  
[Chorus]  
And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon,  
Little boy blue and the man 'n the moon.  
'When you comin' home?'  
'Son, I don't know when. We'll get together then.  
You know we'll have a good time then.'  
  
Well, my son turned ten just the other day.  
He said, 'Thanks for the ball, Dad. Come on, let's play.  
Could you teach me to throw?'  
I said, 'Not today. I got a lot to do.'  
He said, 'That's okay.' And he walked away and he smiled and he said,  
'You know, I'm gonna be like him, yeah.  
You know I'm gonna be like him.'  
  
[Chorus]  
Well, he came from college just the other day,  
So much like a man I just had to say,  
'I'm proud of you. Could you sit for a while?'  
He shook his head and he said with a smile,  
'What I'd really like, Dad, is to borrow the car keys.  
See you later. Can I have them please ?'  
  
[Chorus]  
I've long since retired, my son's moved away.  
I called him up just the other day.  
'I'd like to see you, if you don't mind.'  
He said, 'I'd love to, Dad, if I could find the time.  
You see my new job's a hassle and the kids have the flu,  
But it's sure nice talkin' to you, Dad.  
It's been sure nice talkin' to you.'  
And as I hung up the phone it occurred to me,  
He'd grown up just like me.  
My boy was just like me.  
  
[Chorus]

Well, they keep on taking my heart  
And they keep on taking my soul  
They keep taking an inch when I give them a mile  
And now it seems it's been a while since anyone smiled  
They don't know me  
They don't know me  
But my name is on the highway sign, never look behind  
All those troubles are gone, nothing left but to run  
So meet me down and don't be shy  
A place where we can hide  
There ain't nothing to fear  
There ain't no-one back here  
But you and I and these cloudy skies  
So it's time to leave our home  
And see the faces we've out-grown  
Through the years we've kept our backs to the wind  
So long, farewell, good-bye my friend

Verse 1  
I'm, protected by the leaves of the four leaf clover  
And I, refuse to die for you  
And I, was tempted but the apple made me stronger  
And I, spit it up on you  
And I'm here to free you  
And I'm here to free you  
Verse 2  
I'm infected by the lies that made me colder  
And I, I put my trust for you  
Time has passed me by, my soul is getting stronger  
And I, I never lie for you  
And I'm here to free you  
And I'm here to free you yeah!  
And I'm here to free you  
And I'm here to free you  
Verse 3  
I'm protected by the leaves of a four leaf clover  
And I, I never lie for you  
And I, expect to die for my life won't live much longer  
And I, I never lie for you  
And I'm here to free you  
And I'm here to free you  
To free you  
And I'm here to free you  
And I'm here to free you  

About the time I'm eight years old  
I met the Devil, kept my soul  
Walkin' out on lakes of fire and I'm gone  
Walkin' in a wonderland  
And I don't really understand  
The place I'm comin' to right now today  
  
[Chorus]  
Come tomorrow, you could see the light  
Come tomorrow, break it right down to the place you were before  
  
Fifteen years on down the line  
I guess you'd say I'm doin' fine  
Wandering down that same old road again  
Walkin' in a wonderland  
But Alice doesn't understand  
The place she's comin' to right now today  
  
[Chorus]  
  
On your knees, you'll be begging me please  
As you feel the disease  
You're going down again tonight  
  
See me runnin', watch me fall  
I guess you'd say I've finally found my own,  
See me cryin' and wonder why  
I guess you'd say its time to die today  
  
[Chorus]

[Chorus]  
This time, this time I love you  
Last time, last time I hate you  
Next time, next time I need you  
Baby please don't go  
  
Remember when I met you  
School dress on  
I never could forget you  
And Baby now you're gone  
  
I'm goin' around, around today  
Just tryin' to find the truth  
It doesn't really matter anyway  
When I'm livin' without you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I said come on little darlin'  
Baby don't you see  
I'd never do you harmin', no  
It's just you and me  
  
I'm in the corner right now  
Waiting for your love  
You better make your choice now  
Before a push comes to a shove  
Yeah things seem kinda different  
It ain't the way it was  
Remember what your mama said  
The bond that lies is us  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm by the phone, I'm all alone  
Just waitin' and a prayin' that maybe you'll call  
I gotta know right now, should I stay around, should I stay a while  
Should I stand here crying or baby should I fly - yeah!  
  
Oh come on darlin', Don't you se and don't you know,  
I gotta have your lovin', now now I'll never let you go  
Tryin' to find that girl of mine  
She's so far away  
And I am cryin' - yeah!

Funky fresh tunes  
And you're walking down the street  
And you're trying to find the girl  
That you really want to meet  
  
You're flying past the reef  
And you're drinking shrunken heads  
You wake up in the morning  
And you wish that you were dead  
  
As you stagger home  
In the blackest form of night  
The rollers out in force baby  
They're looking for a fight  
  
You try to play the game  
You try to pass the test  
But the only thing in sight baby  
Is the sight of your arrest  
  
Jail cell, living hell  
Cains off me I'm free  
Doing time, one more time  
Mine, all mine, all mine  
  
Now the country club is cold  
And the country club is mean  
The attendants at the country club  
Ain't something to be seen  
  
If you're messing with my girl  
You're messing with your life  
Cause I'm gonna cut you  
With a big, big knife  
You bet your fuckin' life!  
  
Now as you stagger home  
In the blackest form of night  
The rollers out in force baby  
They're looking for a fight  
  
You try to play the game  
You try to pass the test  
But the only thing in sight baby  
Is the sight of your arrest  
  
Jail cell, living hell  
Cains off me I'm free  
Doing time, one more time  
Mine, all mine, all mine  
  
I want to tell you a story baby  
I hope you want to hear  
I want to tell you a story baby  
I hope you want to hear  
  
Going downtown in the back of a car  
Some motha'fucka' left the door ajar  
Remember what your parents said  
Be home by eight and in your bed  
  
Now as you stagger home  
In the blackest form of night  
The rollers out in force baby  
They're looking for a fight  
  
You try to play the game  
You try to pass the test  
But the only thing in sight baby  
Is the sight of your arrest  
  
Jail cell, living hell  
Cains off me I'm free  
Doing time, one more time  
Mine, all mine, all mine

God, please push me in the right direction  
God, I'm hoping that you'll understand  
God, I'm trying to make amends now  
God, I'm asking for your guiding hand  
  
Everybody's got the wrong opinion  
Everybody says what's on their mind  
Everybody's got the wrong tradition  
Everybody pray to the man  
  
God, I'm reading in your holy books now  
God, I'm singing and I'm not afraid  
God, I'm looking for the only way out now  
God, I'm hoping that I can be saved  
  
Everybody's got the wrong religion  
You won't say what's on your mind  
Some won't hear why others listen  
Everybody pray to the man  
  
Why don't you ever answer questions  
Now my faith is slipping away  
I'm looking in a different direction  
Believing is the only way  
  
Everybody's got their own tradition  
(Everybody's got the wrong religion)  
Everybody's got their own salvation  
(Everybody's got the wrong submission)  
  
Everybody's got their own religion  
(Everybody's got the wrong tradition)  
Everybody pray to the man

Rape, D.U.I., assault and battery  
These are things that will bring you to me  
Murder and theft and all of the above  
You can bet your life I know what you're thinking of  
I've takin' you and I'll take your friends  
Don't worry, we'll all meet in the end  
'Cause life's a bitch and then you die  
Trust me baby cause I don't lie  
  
I'm the Goddamn Devil, this job pleases me  
I'm the Goddamn Devil and I do it for free  
  
I know the story about your life  
If you killed your brother or you beat your wife  
And I am here to punish you  
You can't fool me cause I ain't no fool  
The time has come to say goodbye  
The end is here for those who cheat, steal and lie  
There will be torture and there will be pain  
Cause this is hell, baby, die in flames.  
  
I'm the Goddamn Devil, this job pleases me  
I'm the Goddamn Devil, Satan if you please  
I'm the Goddamn Devil, this job pleases me  
I'm the Goddamn Devil, and I do it for free  
  
I don't care about you, don't care about your life  
Don't care about your children or about your wife  
I'm here to do my job so if you broke the law  
You're checking in with me  
But you can never leave  
  
There's one way out if you dare  
We'll make a deal, you'll grow your hell  
As Satan's child you'll start a band  
And spread the word across the land  
  
I'm the Goddamn Devil, this job pleases me  
I'm the Goddamn Devil, Satan if you please  
I'm the Goddamn Devil, better believe in me (only me)  
I'm the Goddamn Devil!

American flag wraps round the pole  
And the little red man is taking control  
The man with the puppet  
Starts to juggle your dreams  
  
And the world that you live  
May not be what it seems  
Hold onto sorrow, it constantly lies  
And the things that I thought always kept me in stride  
  
Smoke cigarettes till the light came to see  
Read the fine print on the wrong guaruntee  
Little Red Man  
You're kind of young  
  
Now its time to retreat  
You're the right people, the wrong ones for me  
Some turn to apples and lemons of spice  
Wings of tomorrow will swallow your pride  
  
I'm just a dreamer, swimming in my mind  
I'm just a dreamer in my mind  
I'm just a dreamer, laughing into mine  
I'm just a dreamer in my mind  
  
Drinking the sunlight  
The salt from the sea  
You're the wrong people, the right ones for me  
Circular motions and things that are found  
  
Wings of tomorrow you won't hear a sound

[Chorus]  
Mr. Recordman, do you know who I am?  
Mr. Recordman, do you really think I can?  
  
I've takin' a likin' to your game  
I think we all, we feel the same  
Is this a dream or is it real  
You say you want to cut a deal?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Don't need much time to think about  
I'm sure that you have got the clout  
I only hope that you're my friend  
And stand by me until the end  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Sell a lotta records 'n' tour 'round the world,  
Make a lotta money 'n' meet lotsa' girls  
Mr. Recordman, do you really think I can?  
  
It sound like music to my ears  
I've dreamed of this for many years  
  
Sell a lotta records 'n' tour 'round the world,  
Make a lotta money 'n' meet lotsa' girls  
Have a lot of fun and hang with my bro's  
'Cause these boys and this band is all that I know  
  
If not for the money and not for the show  
Are you here for me or here for the dough?  
Mr. Recordman, do you really give a damn?

Sittin' on a rusty park bench baby  
Not much else to do  
Smoke cigarettes and rink my Mickey's  
Fine malt liquor brew  
As I start drinkin' and I start thinkin'  
That death is on my side  
If my heart stopped beatin', the street kept reekin'  
That's suicide, that's right!  
  
I grew up in the inner city  
A dark part of this town  
Just another innocent backwoods victim  
Society like to put down  
You can call me a boozer, or call me a loser  
It really doesn't matter to me  
I got a bench for snoozin', some sauce to keep boozin'  
That's all I neeed  
  
[Chorus]  
I keep it comin', sometimes I don't know why  
I'm gonna do it 'til the day i die  
  
Consider me the duke as I dine in your dumpster  
Unsanitary engineer  
Baron of the bench the panhandlin' master  
Well, I'm pullin' twenty G's a year  
I know it ain't much but at least I'm in touch, yeah  
With reality  
And I wouldn't trade no places to be in rat races  
No siree!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yo, Mr. Trump, can I ask you a question  
You got some spare change for me sucker?  
'Cause I'm down and out and there ain't no doubt  
That I am here to stay  
  
Yeah you see me lyin' with my brothers  
In the gutter with my paper bag in hand  
Yeah the streets are cold but at least  
There's soul and that's all I need!  
  
You'll take away my peace of mind  
You'll leave me there to rot and die  
But look again, my careless friend  
The world you live is just a lie  
It's a give and take, the more the fake  
The more the pain, the more you lose  
Live your life, don't take no sides  
N'seize the day and drink your booze!

It doesn't matter who you are  
Or what you're gonna be  
People from all walks of life  
You gotta have diversity  
We're all in this together  
And together we shall be  
You gotta be a friendly neighbor  
If you're gonna live next to me  
We're all  
  
Livin' on the same side  
Same side of town  
Walkin' down the same streets  
The streets that are all around  
  
You could be my brother  
Or you could be my friend  
But don't turn your back on me  
Cause we'll be here 'til the end  
Yeah, we're all in this together  
And we all have that dream  
To live in perfect harmony  
Like a family that's the scene  
Yeah, we're all...  
  
Livin' on the same side  
Same side of town  
Walkin' down the same streets  
The Streets that are all around  
Livin' on the same side  
Same side of town  
Shufflin' to the same beat  
The beat that's all around  
  
Stumblin' down on D.P., keggers all around,  
Laughin' at the police as they try to take us down  
Hangin' with each other, yeah hangin' with our bro's  
We all love one another, from our heads down to our toes

Slower than nowhere  
Playing Hide and Seek  
Walking from room to room  
Will you follow me  
  
Will you challenge me  
My destiny will follow me  
And set me free  
And set me free  
  
Slower than nowhere  
Cold in the mid-west  
Don't take away my shine  
Asking me something  
  
Giving me nothing  
That's okay, take your time  
Prelude to madness  
Certain circles hold  
  
Fall to the west side, I'll take my own  
Come on now, come on now  
Down to my luck and  
Speaking of nothing  
  
Feeling the ground move under me  
Do you feel the same  
Do you feel the same  
Slower than nowhere  
  
I feel the ground move under me  
Slower than nowhere  
Prelude to madness  
Certain circles hold  
  
Fall to the wayside, I'll take my own  
Come on now

I want to know, why the people are everywhere, and  
I want to know, where to go if I get scared, and  
I want to be, in a place where no one cares, and  
  
I, I, I want to know you!  
'Cause you're so damn cool!  
Yeah, you're so damn cool!  
  
I want to feel like I'm floatin' in the air, and  
I want to know if the sun'ss gonna bleach my hair, and  
I want to know why life's so unfair and  
  
I want to know you!  
Because you're so damn cool!  
Yeah, you're so damn cool!  
  
Who knows what I'm feelin' inside of me!  
And who knows if I'm feelin' all right!  
Who knows what I'm feelin' inside of me  
Who knows what is runnin' around in my brain  
  
Now that I'm done and I seen it  
And don't think that I'm tryin' to complain  
Don't think I'm lyin' 'cause I mean it  
N' all you people out there don't look at me to lay  
All of your blame 'cause you need me  
And you want me to go down  
In flames with the rest  
But I'm so sick of denyin'  
What is runnin' around in my brain

All the way from across the sea  
From man to you, from the man to me  
Four white sticks with good intentions  
Feed the flame  
For my protection  
  
I want to know what you want  
To find what I don't  
But now it's yesterday  
  
Falling down a broken spiral  
Head the flame for no tomorrow  
Back up on your feet again  
Hole my hand, I'll be your friend  
  
The leaves are falling  
Falling down  
Falling down  
Falling down again

I've got the hair  
I've got the teeth  
I've got the eyes  
Well Peggy, take a look outside the window  
  
I've got the car  
I'm the lead singer  
I'm the man  
She, she come to me and set me free  
  
That makes me feel good  
She, she's New York grown I'm all alone  
She makes me feel good  
Never going down a suckerpath baby  
  
She, she makes me real and sex appeal  
That makes me feel good  
She, she fills my soul, it makes me whole  
That makes me feel good  
  
Never going down a suckerpath baby  
Now all day as you're calling me lazy  
Never going down the suckerpath baby  
Never go down never go down  
  
She treats me like a foolish child  
And laughing all the while  
Makes me want to be alive  
She sees me in a different light  
  
And knows I'll be alright  
Makes me want to be alive  
All the things I could have said  
Some days now I wish I'm dead  
  
A foolish child an awesome dream  
I think you know just what I mean  
Never going down a suckerpath baby  
Come on come on  
  
You don't want to ride me I don't even care  
You don't even move my style now  
I don't even care now

Too many times I've seen your kind  
Washed upon the shore  
Too many times you locked me out  
Johnny knockin', knocking at your door  
  
You're looking past the mirror  
Yes you've reached the other side  
You're striving for the pinnacle  
But you're holding on too tight  
  
And when you hold the ticket  
For your one way ride  
You wonder where you're going  
And you can't hide  
  
Too bad, too bad, too bad, too bad, johnny  
What you gonna do  
Too bad, too bad, too bad, too bad, johnny  
Now your time is through  
  
So many highs and lows right now  
What are we to do  
You know we're trying so damn hard  
Johnny just to try and talk to you  
  
You're swimming in an ocean  
It's so black and cold  
I feel you got the notion  
And it's eating at your soul  
  
And when you hold the ticket  
For your one way ride  
You wonder where you're going  
And you can't hide  
  
Too bad, too bad, too bad, too bad, johnny  
What you gonna do  
Too bad, too bad, too bad, too bad, johnny  
Now your time is through  
  
She said, she knew the answer  
He was falling - a falling faster  
Round and round and round - no where to go  
Someone had to help the boy  
He said no, no, no, no, no, no, no!  
  
So many mixed emotions  
And they're driving you insane  
A grip on some reality  
Silence quiet on your window pain  
  
You're looking past the mirror  
Yes you've reached the other side  
You're striving for the pinnacle  
But you're holding on too tight

The pain is gone  
The rain and storm they stumble down  
The sun disguised again today  
The wagon rolls, its axis bound  
  
Another bottle cracked today  
The game moves on  
The people push and move so hard  
Where now don't those flavors go  
  
Answer now  
Your questions move like undertow  
Off to find your island now  
We got pulled out by the undertow  
  
That's the way the wind blows  
Everybody's laughing  
We got pulled out by the undertow  
That's the way the wind blows  
  
Too long today  
We got pulled out by the undertow  
That's the way the wind blows

Shut up, talking out your ass  
With your fake-ass grin and your backstage pass  
Front row at every single show  
But your heart's in the wrong place  
  
It's in the rat race  
I don't know what you're trying to prove  
Always fucking at my band  
When we're laying down a fat groove  
  
I got no jealously not towards security  
Why are you always bringing me  
Stay the fuck away from me  
I'm talking to you V.I.P.  
  
I'm talking to you  
I know the power you possess  
Playing cool rock for the all access  
Big which, it's jealousy  
  
I see that your heart's in the wrong place  
You can't follow me  
I don't know why you're kissing my ass  
Cause as soon as I turn my back you start stabbin'  
  
I'm reality, you can't just even bother me  
I'm the one they came to see  
Stay the fuck away from me  
I'm talking to you V.I.P.

Suburban white alcoholic trash  
We ain't glam and we ain't trash  
We're victims of a society  
That fucks with me about sobriety  
  
They say don't drink this and don't drink that  
'Cause it does a little more than just make you fat  
It's a serious disease that you learn about in school  
And if your dad's an alcoholic you'll be one too  
  
Mom and dad don't have a clue  
The one-fifty-one is now eighty proof  
And all the times I borrowed the car  
Not as a ride but as a shitface bar  
  
Fuck yeah! I got the venom in my veins  
God damn! This shit is drivin' me insane  
Boo ya! I ain't ever gonna be the same  
Whiplash liquor, sure is quicker  
Makes you sicker, it's the best!  
  
Weekend comes and my parents are gone  
It's time to party once I mow the lawn  
Havin' fun ain't that a fact  
It's rock 'n' roll in the cul-de-sac!  
  
Invite everyone and your neighbors too  
It's gonna be a whacked out rock 'n' roll zoo  
But don't be blabbin' it around my mother  
But invite everyone and your skate rat brother  
  
Fuck yeah! I got the venom in my veins  
God damn! This shit is drivin' me insane  
Boo ya! I ain't ever gonna be the same  
Whiplash liquor, sure is quicker  
Makes you sicker, it's the best!
