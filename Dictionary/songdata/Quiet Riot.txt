[Verse 1:]  
I?ve been the distance and I?ve seen it all  
I?ve been turned around by love and hate  
I have resided in my private hell  
But I love this life and I live to tell  
  
[Chorus:]  
Blind Faith is the cause of the trouble  
Blind faith what we bleed  
  
[Verse 2:]  
When I was young I didn?t realize  
There was hope and fear with no compromise  
And now I testify before myself  
I keep walking on in my innocence  
  
[Bridge:]  
I know if you follow me- you get what want, you get what you need  
Somebody?s got to set you free- you get what want, you get what you need  
Now don?t you give it and learn to breathe  
You hear a message now before you leave  
You know the fortune here that you have found  
There ain?t no doubt about it, there ain?t no doubt about it

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!!  
  
My control  
That's what you take from me  
Damned my soul  
And you won't let me be  
Stop me in my tracks, there's no looking back  
I can't see (no)  
It's much too late  
I feel great  
You take my breath away  
  
You leave me breathless  
You got me helpless  
You take my breath away  
  
You leave me breathless  
You got me helpless  
You take my breath away  
  
Inside-out, that's how she turns my head  
All my doubts are never put to bed  
She's got me runnin' blind, never think I'll find sanity (oh)  
Hyperventilate, nothing's a in her place  
She takes my breath away  
  
And leaves me breathless  
Yes I'm so helpless  
She takes my breath away  
  
You leave me breathless  
I'm so helpless  
You take my breath away  
  
You take me if I breath  
And never let me know  
You cast a spell on me, and you don't let me go go go go go  
  
You leave me breathless  
You got me helpless  
You take my breath away  
  
You leave me breathless  
I'm so helpless  
You take my breath away  
  
You leave me breathless (oh, oh)  
You leave me breathless  
I'm breathless, breathless  
You leave me breathless  
Leave me breathless!  
  

[Verse 1:]  
You sucked religion from my life  
When we met I believed you were hell  
Take the knife from my back  
I know you? Ll use it again  
Don? T Think Of Me  
I won? T think of you  
Don? T Think Of Me  
I won? T think of you  
You don? T give  
You just take  
You don? T give  
You just break  
  
[Verse 2:]  
We were never friends  
A one act play  
I had to stop pretending  
My heart don? T ache since you? Ve been gone  
It? S like you never left  
Don? T Think Of Me  
I won? T think of you  
Don? T Think Of Me  
I won? T think of you  
You don? T give  
You just take  
You don? T give  
You just take  
  
[Bridge:]  
My time and my money but money ain? T love no  
The evil within shines without a light  
I know what I see and I mean what I say

Everybody wants to have a girl like you  
But I'm the one and it's right  
Somebody comes along and says they play your song  
My wish becomes his delight  
He'll try to take you from me  
  
Don't wanna let you go  
Not gonna get far from me  
Don't wanna let you go  
Your special your one of a kind (so...)  
Don't wanna let you go  
Some things money can't buy  
  
Your smiles pasted  
My time is wasted  
You say I told you so, told you so  
You can't tell lies from facts  
He'll try to hold you back  
You make the tension grow, grow and grow  
He'll try to take you from me  
  
Don't wanna let you go  
Your not gonna get far from me  
Don't wanna let you go  
Your special your one of a kind (so...)  
Don't wanna let you go  
Some things money can't buy...  
  
Don't wanna let you go  
  
Don't wanna let you go  
  
Everybody wants to have a girl like you  
But I'm the one and it's right  
And somebody comes along and says he plays your song  
My wish becomes his delight  
He'll try to take you from me  
  
Don't wanna let you go  
Your not gonna get far from me  
Don't wanna let you go  
Your special your one of a kind (so...)  
Don't wanna let you go  
Some things money can't buy...  
  
Don't wanna let you go  
Your special your one of a kind (so...)  
Don't wanna let you go  
Some things money can't buy...  
  
Don't wanna let you go  
Don't wanna let you go  
Don't wanna let you go  
He'll try to take you away from me  
Don't wanna let you go, let you go, oh no no no (yeah)

She's a dancing girl who brings up the heat  
Hits on all the men  
She knows how to move and make you feel  
Like you want to get into sin  
A chocolate bar was going really far  
Really made me catch my breath  
So she had an unordinary glance  
I got down tools in the chest  
Down and dirty  
You're down and dirty, alright  
She's down and dirty  
You're down and dirty  
She twisted her ass around drinks  
While the dirty works the girl's booty  
Whispered in my ear what I want to hear  
Says, "Come with me baby, let's play." (Okay!)  
She went to the back to get her traps  
My sixth sense was bothering me  
She came to work and something I heard  
Makes me want to get comfy  
Down and dirty  
She's down and dirty, alright  
Get down and dirty  
Get down (Listen)  
Down and dirty  
Woo!  
Alright  
Ooh yeah  
Well there's something going on  
Something I've never known before  
Leather and lace is all that I can see  
I lost my power of will  
You know she should be still  
Never thought I'd get hit by some teen, no  
I start to bleed, have mercy on me  
I'm feelin' a bit distressed  
What you're doing to me is so obscene  
Got myself into a mess  
She started to dance, I grabbed my pants  
Found my way to the door  
Hot on my trail, a thousand females  
Saying, "Baby, more more more!"  
Down and dirty  
(Hurt me)  
Down and dirty  
(Well, well, well)  
Down and dirty  
(Oh yeah)  
Get down and dirty  
(She is)  
Get down (Down)  
Get dirty (Dirty)  
Take me down (Alright)  
One more  
Get down (Oh yeah)  
Get dirty (Turn around)  
Get down (Come over here)  
Down and dirty  
Come back for more, ya hear? Hah!  
  
  

I've seen a look of evil in your eyes  
You've been filling me all full of lies  
Sorrow will not change your shameful deeds  
Do well best, someone else has better seen  
  
Evil woman, don't you play your games with me  
Evil woman, don't you play your games with me  
  
Now I know just what you're looking for  
You want me to claim that child you bore  
Well you know that it must he not be  
And you know the way it got to be  
  
Evil woman, don't you play your games with me  
Evil woman, don't you play your games with  
  
Evil woman, don't you play your games with me  
Evil woman, don't you play your games with me  
  
Wickedness lies in your moisten lips  
Your body moves just like the crack of a whip  
Blackness sleeps on top of your stray bed  
Do you wish that you could see me dead  
  
Evil woman, don't you play your games with me  
Evil woman, don't you play your games with me  
Evil woman, don't you play your games with me  
Evil woman, don't you play your games with me

Now I've got a chick who will be with me  
Anytime, day or night  
But I won't put up with no runnin' around  
You know it just ain't right  
I'm going down...  
To the town -  
Out to go drink with the clowns  
You stay at home...  
All alone -  
And don't you talk on the phone  
  
You're comin' face to face with the guy that's gonna knock you dead  
Face to face with the guy that's gonna bust your head  
I'm gonna knock you on the floor  
You'll beg me for no more  
You're comin' face to face with me, like it or not  
  
When I got to town  
The words going 'round  
That you've been seen on your back  
I open the door and you were on the floor  
Spreadin' for the clowns in my pack  
Now you were wrong...  
If you thought -  
I'd take it lyin' down like a dog  
I put a match...  
In her snatch  
She thinks she's such a hot little vamp  
  
You're comin' face to face with the guy that's gonna knock you dead  
Face to face with the guy that's gonna bust your head  
I'm gonna knock you on the floor  
You'll beg me for no more  
You comn' face to face with me, like it or not  
  
Tear your face apart  
Waste you in the dark  
Rip you like a shark  
Won't think you're so smart  
  
Face to face (face to face) you disgrace  
Face to face (face to face) you disgrace  
Face to face (face to face) you disgrace  
Face to face  
Face to face  
  
Face to face with the guy that's gonna knock you dead  
Your're comin' face to face with the guy that's gonna bust your head  
I'm gonna knock you on the floor  
You'll beg me for no more  
You're comin' face to face with me, like it or not

Too much coffee's gonna shatter my nerves,  
Too much whiskey's gonna stutter my words  
A whole lotta speed gonna take me to fast,  
How much longer can I last  
  
Too many women gonna put me to waste,  
Too much money gonna spoil my taste  
Doctor says to slow down if you want to stay alive,  
How am I gonna survive... I want to know  
I want to know, I want to know, I want to know, oh yea  
Been working to hard don't got no time to rest,  
Don't look to well I ain't feeling my best  
Can't push much harder before I fall on the ground,  
I'm gonna have a nervous breakdown  
  
I've gotta slow down,  
Get my feet on the ground, yeah  
I better slow down fast,  
Today could be my last, all right

[Verse 1:]  
You criticize the way I talk, You can?t know how I feel, yeah yeah yeah.  
I sympathize with your dark nature, you don?t know what that takes no no no  
It?s a matter of time now can?t you see  
Before I turn to your dark enemy  
I hear a voice that?s telling me  
  
[Chorus:]  
I?m free, free of the drama, free from the karma, free of the beast  
Free, out of my head free of the dread, the moment we met  
  
[Verse 2:]  
You can?t invade your tired old demons I won?t commiserate no no no  
You suck the life out of every room how much can I take I don?t know  
Like a flower that burns you to the touch  
It?s so beautiful but takes so much  
Of the life inside of me

You gotta believe we can change the world  
Don't turn a blind eye to tomorrow's world  
But on the good side looking out  
Don't take for granted the silent shout  
The hands of time are rolling past  
To turn the tide, we must move fast  
Let's share the hope and pull some strings  
We hold the answer this vision sings  
They're holding on  
But for how long  
Let's set them free  
Put your helping hands together rockin' on for survival  
Gotta take a stand, time to make a plan, don't sit idle  
We are the key to the dreams  
It's not as hard as it seems  
No  
Get up and put your hands together  
All your helping hands  
Oh yeah  
We're three steps down, you're two steps back  
No more widgin' and that's a fact  
A call to arms, let's take a stand  
It's up to you to lend a helping hand  
They're holding on  
But for how long  
Let's set them free  
Put your helping hands together rockin' on for survival  
Gotta take a stand, time to make a plan, don't sit idle  
We are the key to the dreams  
It's not as hard as it seems  
No  
Get up and put your hands together  
All your helping hands, yeah

That brings the winds of change  
Together we can overcome  
And start a brand new day  
Put your helping hands together rockin' on for survival (Yeah yeah)  
Gotta take a stand, it's time to make a plan, don't sit idle (No, no, no, no)  
Put your helping hands together rockin' on for survival  
Gotta take a stand, c'mon make a plan, don't sit idle (Oh!)  
  
  

[Originally by acdc]  
Living easy, living free  
Season ticket on a one-way ride  
Asking nothing, leave me be  
Taking everything in my stride  
Don't need reason, don't need rhyme  
Ain't nothing I would rather do  
Going down, party time  
My friends are gonna be there too  
I'm on the highway to hell  
No stop signs, speed limit  
Nobody's gonna slow me down  
Like a wheel, gonna spin it  
Nobody's gonna mess me round  
Hey satan, payed my dues  
Playing in a rocking band  
Hey momma, look at me  
I'm on my way to the promised land  
I'm on the highway to hell  
(don't stop me)  
And I'm going down, all the way down  
I'm on the highway to hell

All I ever get from you  
Are attitudes and broken rules but...  
I just wanna feel your love beside me  
A new day is gonna come  
Together to sing my song  
Got to feel the melody inside you  
I wanna be, I wanna be inside you  
I wanna feel, I wanna feel inside you  
Love's fire burnin' in my brain  
Love's fire gonna drive me insane  
I wanna be, I wanna be inside you  
Since your flowing through my veins  
I ain't never felt the same  
Feels like a whole new world inside me  
I'm never gonna let you go  
Gotta let your feelings show  
Never, never leave the love inside you  
I wanna be, I wanna be inside you  
I wanna feel, I wanna feel inside you  
Love's fire burnin' in my brain  
Love's fire gonna drive me insane  
I wanna be, I wanna be inside you  
Nothing could ever take you away from me  
No one would ever take me (yeah yeah) inside of you  
I wanna be, I wanna be inside you  
I wanna feel, I wanna feel inside you  
I wanna be inside you  
I wanna be inside you  
I wanna be inside you  
I wanna be inside you  
I wanna be inside you  
  

[Verse 1:]  
You got a laundry list of today?s complaints  
you think you?re a superstar who?s shit don?t stank  
You?re a nothing wrapped up in a something?s clothes  
You?re the kinda person I don?t want to know  
I don?t hear you- please shut up  
I don?t see you- cause you?re too tough  
  
[Chorus:]  
All the things I do they make you crazy  
You always say I?m useless and I?m lazy  
You moan and groan and bitch what does that prove?  
  
[Verse 2:]  
You can?t sit still, you never act straight  
I get uncomfortable when I see your face  
Everybody?s talking behind your back  
You?re a three time loser into the cracks

[Verse 1]  
Walking 'round the town with nothing to do  
Rock-n-roll ringin' in my ears  
Why adjust my mind, just singin' the blues  
Got to find a way out of here  
  
[Chorus]  
It's not so funny  
Just a kid, nobody listens to me  
Ain't got no money to do what I want  
Somethings got to set me free  
  
[Verse 2]  
You say when you grow up you'll have what you want  
And everything that you need  
What is the use of having it all  
If you listen and never be seen  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If I could suddenly be older  
I'd show them all and bring them down to my size  
  
[Verse 3]  
My parents tell me you're not the only one  
There's a lot of kids around like you  
If all of us kids got together for fun  
We'd show you a thing or two  
  
No no no  
  
[Chorus x2]  
  
It's not so funny  
I ain't got no money  
It's not so funny  
I ain't got no money  
It's not so funny

I know just how you want it  
Here goes, just how you need it  
I know just how to give it  
You say you love me, yes you do  
I believe it, 'cause I can see it  
When you hold me, a feelin' inside  
You're givin' and I'm takin'  
I'm there just when you want me  
You know I'll never leave you  
Happens every time I see you  
You got my lovin' in your hands  
Don't shake it, don't break it  
I love you so much, don't you know  
Love thinkin', start dreamin'  
I know just how you want it  
Here goes, just how you need it  
I know just how to give it  
I know I know I know (listen)  
What you got is what I need  
I need your love, can't you see  
What you got is up my sleeve  
I won't ever make you plead  
Here I stand, on the ground  
Your love baby, is what I've found  
You say you love me, yes you do  
I believe it, 'cause I can see it  
When you hold me, a feelin' inside  
You're givin' and I'm takin'  
I know just how you want it  
Here goes, just how you need it  
I know just how you want it  
I know I know I know I know...  
I know  
  
  

[Verse 1]  
The chicks in the town been runnin' around  
Their on the loose  
Legs are spread for freedom for bread  
Their on the loose  
Can't get enough to satisfy their lust  
On the loose  
  
[Chorus]  
Killer girls waitin' in line for me  
Blood thirsty, get home in time for tea  
Killer girls for all you boys to see  
Easy action, get what you want for free  
  
[Verse 2]  
Never easy, got a stick shift disease  
Turn me loose  
I'll hypnotized when they give me the eye  
Turn me loose  
In their disguise I see murder and lies  
Turn me loose  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 3]  
Killer girls in a frenzy on me  
I got no more juice  
Take my advice, you'd better think twice  
No more juice  
They'll hump and bump you, forget your name  
Ya got more juice

When mommy's around we're the cutest little darlings, polite...  
We're squeaky clean  
We do the chores in the house, as quiet as a mouse  
Better kids you've never seen  
Yes we are mama's little angels  
Yes we are mama's little angels  
You know we are mama's little angels  
As soon as mom leaves for work  
Out come the paint cans, start to spray it on the wall  
That's getting boring  
Go get the bats  
Gonna have us some indoor ball  
Yes we are mama's little angels  
Yes we are mama's little angels  
You know we are mama's little angels  
Well, Randy's up to bat.  
Gonna hit me a home run  
Sorry 'bout that  
Outside, ball one  
We lost our ball, let's have some fun with the dishes  
Oops, we ain't doin' too well  
When mommy gets home, she won't blame it on us  
She knows that we're really swell  
Yes we are mama's little angels  
Yes we are mama's little angels  
You know we are mama's little angels  
Yes we are mama's little angels  
Yes we are mama's little angels  
You know we are mama's little angels  
  
  

[Verse 1:]  
I never felt it coming, but you love in a supernatural way  
Now you got me running, babe I? M running and I can? T get away  
And I feel like I lost control of my very soul, yes I did  
Does it mean that much to you And all the things we? Ve been through  
What? S a poor boy to do  
And I just wanna let you know that I love you  
  
[Chorus:]  
Now I? M face to face in the mirror  
And I see what love has done  
Let me tell you my thoughts and my visions  
Old Habits,

Hang loose  
Party  
Got my head to the grindstone  
I'm trying to act like a fool  
My head is a lampshade  
They can't find me at school  
Well I'm an animal  
Yes I'm a cannonball  
They say I'm out for blood  
One thing I wanna do is  
Party all night (Oh-oh!)  
Party all night (Oh-oh-oh!)  
Party all night (Yeah!)  
All night long  
Driving right way on the wrong side  
A bit too much to drink  
Women in the backseat  
And they don't know what to think  
They say I've lost my head  
You'll probably end up dead  
But they're too blind to see  
What's a party to me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Is to party all night (Oh-oh!)  
Let's party all night (Oh-oh-oh!)  
Party all night (Yeah!)  
All night long  
Uh!  
Let's have a good time, good time  
c'mon  
Everybody's parties  
I'm on a one way cruise  
Lookin' for trouble  
We got nothing to lose  
They're on the telephone  
They're trying to send me home  
We're gonna pull the plug  
We've got a new kind of school  
Let's party all night  
Let's party all night  
Party all night  
Let's party all night  
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)  
Let's party all night (Oh!)

All night long, yeah!

Looking for some truth  
Is what you really want to find

You see that from the front row  
We are shapes of things to come  
You're handcuffed to your seat  
And there is no place left to run  
  
Your brains are in our power  
We ponder as we feed  
A healthy dose of metal  
And that's all you'll ever need  
  
I want more

So give it all

Well I have street sense radar  
Ooh, is supposed be news  
You better lock up your daughters  
You never know when we're due  
  
Good news, bad news  
It's all the same  
Addicts on main streets  
They give us the blame  
  
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!  
We're a sign of the times  
Having fun ain't no crime  
We're a sign of the times  
Having fun all the time, yeah  
  
Great impersonators  
We broke all the rules  
We laugh with our masks on  
The joke is on you  
  
You're getting furry  
It does you no good  
It's the same old story  
It's a human zoo  
  
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!  
We're a sign of the times  
Having fun ain't no crime  
We're a sign of the times

Having fun all the time  
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

We're not the ones to blame  
Burning passions mixed with pain  
Past the point of no return  
Nothing stays the same  
The streets become our home  
Restless souls out on our own  
Trapped my ruins made by fools  
Chasing the unknown  
In the still of the night  
With nowhere to turn  
We took a roll of the dice  
And we learn  
And in the still of the night  
Streets of fire will burn  
As we run for our lives  
To survive  
Yeah  
Voices in the dark  
Calling us to play a part  
Little be known the razor's edge  
Have we gone too far?  
Every chance that we take  
There is a price that must be paid  
It's easy come and easy go  
But we are here to stay  
Yeah!  
In the still of the night  
With nowhere to turn  
We took a roll of the dice  
And we learn  
In the still of the night  
Streets of fire will burn  
As we run for our lives  
To survive  
Yeah  
Oh!  
In the still of the night (Of the night)  
With nowhere to turn  
We took a roll of the dice  
And we learn  
And in the still of the night  
Streets of fire will burn  
As we run, run for our lives  
To survive  
To survive  
To survive  
And where do I turn  
In the still of the night  
And what did I learn  
In the still of the night  
The fires still burn, yeah  
Yeah, yeah  
  
  

[Verse 1:]  
Pummeled from the moment you wake a void of confusion 24 hours a day  
Twisted reality eternal debate the clouds are flowing something?s going to
break.  
Deliver me it will deliver you, faceless masses of grey and blue  
The sky is falling a rain of blood  
The soul?s are empty above  
  
[Chorus:]  
Strange Daze- it?s hard to accept  
Strange ways- you never expect  
Strange daze-Nothing makes sense  
Strange Daze trying to make sense of it all  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Loss of balance with an axe to grind  
People talking with nothing really on their minds  
No provocation, no sparks to the flame  
Investigations with nothing left say  
Remember me, I won?t remember you  
Dogs are howling over what you do  
Skin is crawling you embrace your self I?m not feeling too well

Get ready  
Hah!  
We got blind compassion  
Don't need discussion  
Think you know just what I mean  
Nowhere's a smokin'  
While the rules are broken  
Had to be seen to be believed  
As a preacher of lust  
You gotta do what you must  
Practice what you preach  
If you got an invitation  
We'll change the location  
Gotta have room to breathe  
I want love, huh!  
Whole lotta love, tons!  
Give me love  
Our love  
Well let's pump her, pump her  
Strike it rich what you're dreamin' of  
(The Pump)  
Let's pump her, pump her  
(Damn)  
We're gonna hunt for gold  
Gonna dig for love  
The more I get  
The more I want  
Love mushes out my brain  
She's gotta move real slow  
High and low  
The girl's gonna drive me insane  
She's got a real cool cat  
That know where it's at  
Has to be the ultimate find  
Have you heard the score  
Ready for more  
I knew that the pump was the prize  
I want love  
Give your love  
Wow!  
Love  
Ooh  
Love  
Well let's pump her, pump her  
Strike it rich what you're dreamin' of

Times are changing  
Nothing stays the same  
For this jukebox generation  
  
Adhere to fashion  
Like computer games  
Modern day communication  
  
The news hard to take  
Will fade tomorrow  
They are the strong  
They'll survive  
  
The wild and the young  
They all have their dreams  
The wild and the young  
They've got to be free  
The sun never sets  
For souls on the run  
The wild and the young  
  
Yeah  
Hah!  
  
Roaring passion  
With no guilt or shame  
It's accepting education, yeah!  
  
Misbehaving  
No regrets, no blame  
With a bold kind of sophistication  
  
So close to the edge  
And high on the wire  
They are not wrong  
They're alive  
  
The wild and the young  
They all have their dreams  
The wild and the young  
They've got to be free  
The sun never sets  
For souls on the run  
The wild and the young  
  
Ha!  
  
So close to the edge  
And high on the wire  
They are not wrong  
They're alive  
  
Look out!  
  
Wild, wild  
The wild and the  
Young, y-y-y-young  
  
The wild and the young  
They all have their dreams  
The wild and the young  
They've got to be free  
The sun never sets  
For souls on the run  
  
The wild and the young  
They all have their dreams  
The wild and the young  
They've got to be free  
The sun never sets  
For souls on the run  
The wild and the young  
  
Oh yeah  
  
The wild and the young  
Oh  
  
Right  
  

Hello you

You can't come back  
Your flyin' free  
You think you found  
Everything that you need  
  
Fly away, fly away  
To your new home  
Across the seas  
Oh leave your nest  
Oh baby leave the best thing  
That you've been  
Whoa, whoa, whoa  
  
Fly on, Thunderbird fly  
Fly on, spread your wings to the sky  
Fly on, Thunderbird fly  
  
On your own  
And I'm alone  
In the shadow  
Of what we done  
And I can't help but think  
That someday  
You'll be back home (whoa)  
  
Fly away, fly away  
To your new home  
Across the bay  
And give your best

Don't look back  
But think of me  
We'll meet again  
Fly away (oh)

I'm... A little tin soldier that wants to jump into the fight  
Yes you, you're a look in your eye, a dream passing by in the sky  
Now I don't understand  
But all I need is treat me like a man  
'Cause I ain't no child, take me like I am.  
  
I've got to know I'm in love with you  
Do anything that you want me to  
Sing any song that you want me to  
Sing to you  
  
All I need, is your whispered "hello", smiles melting from your window  
Your eyes, are deeper than time, sailing on that with the breeze  
So now I've lost my way  
I need help to show me things to say  
Give me your love, before love fades away  
  
I've got to know I'm in love with you  
Do anything that you want me to  
Sing any song that you want me to  
Sing it to you  
  
I don't need no... Compensation  
And I just got to beg you, listen  
I just got to beg you  
I've got to know I'm in love with you  
Do anything that you want me to  
Sing any song that you want me to  
Sing it to you (watch out)  
I just want some reaction  
Someone to give me satisfaction  
All I've gotta to do is stay next to you  
Some reaction  
A little bit of satisfaction  
All I'm gonna do is get next to you  
I've got to know I'm in love with you  
Do anything that you want me to  
Sing any song that you want me to  
Sing it to you  
  
I've got to know I'm in love with you (yes I am)  
Do anything that you want me to (I'm gonna sing her a song)  
Sing any song that you want me to (right on ta you)  
Sing it to you (Yeah yeah)  
  
I've got to know I'm in love with you (yes I do)  
Do anything that you want me to  
Sing any song that you want me to  
Sing it to you

I got a letter in the mail sayin' I'm gonna go to jail  
Someone's got an ax  
Lookin' it out for me  
Well I was feelin' pretty nice didn't have to think twice  
Finders keepers baby, keep it away from me  
  
You got nothin' that I need  
Stay away from me  
I'll quicken your pace to heaven  
You try to give me your lot  
Well I hope you rot  
Gonna tell the devil about you  
  
[Chorus 1]  
You're gettin' me in trouble  
You're gettin' me in trou...  
Gettin' me in trouble  
Every day and night  
  
I'm alright  
Well I'm a high speed king I never think about a thing  
All I can do is moan  
  
Everybody takes a turn from the trash I have learned  
But why the hard way for me, I don't know  
  
I'm gonna get you back  
Stab you in the fat  
I'll make you wish you never met me  
I gonna make you sing the blues  
You're gonna lose  
Show you what you got yourself into  
  
[Chorus 2]  
You're gettin' me in trouble  
You're Gettin' me in trouble  
Gettin' me in trouble  
Every day and night  
  
I'm all...  
You try to put the weight of the world  
On top of my shoulders  
You got to know that you're a little girl  
Who wants to feel older, feel older (watch out)  
  
Trouble, yeah  
Trouble, yeah yeah  
I'm in trouble baby (oh yeah)  
  
[Chorus 2]  
  
I'm in trouble, trouble, trouble (alright)  
I'm in trouble, trouble, trouble  
Trouble, trouble, trouble  
Trouble, trouble, trouble

Midnight masquerade  
Innocent fantasies  
Never ended from room to room  
Dressed up for sharades  
Every guest has a part to play  
And the rules are understood  
Undercover  
A secret rendez-vous  
They won't discover  
That it's me and it's you  
At the Twilight Hotel  
Check your soul at the door  
They've got memories to sell  
And so much more  
Last call at the bar  
Fast talkin' it promises  
Never really reaching the lines  
Seems to bizarre  
Such a twisted reality  
This place full of manic minds  
It's like a dreamland  
With time standing still  
So make your big plans  
They've got all the frills  
At the Twilight Hotel  
Check your soul at the door  
They've got memories to sell  
And so much more  
In the Twilight Hotel  
Price of life still like gold  
It's a twilight magic spell  
And anything goes  
Undercover  
A secret rendez-vous  
They won't discover  
That it's me and it's you  
At the Twilight Hotel  
Check your soul at the door  
They've got memories to sell  
And so much more  
In the Twilight Hotel  
Price of life still like gold  
It's a twilight magic spell  
And anything goes  
  

All I need is a place in my heart  
To keep me happy 'til the day I die  
All I want is a place in my soul  
To reach up far and touch the sky  
It's magic  
We've got the smile that'll make you laugh (ha)  
A special way to show you it's real  
Some people think it's a touch of class  
But you know it's just the way we feel  
It's magic  
We've got the magic, deep in our souls  
We've got the magic, to play rock-n-roll  
We've got the magic, to never grow old  
Can't you hear the sound, in the air  
Can't wait to show this magic inside  
Gonna bust out and spread it wide  
Can't you hear what we're trying to say  
Feeling's gettin' stronger everyday  
It's magic  
We've got the magic, deep in our souls  
We've got the magic, to play rock-n-roll  
We've got the magic, to never grow old  
Can't you hear the sound, in the air (whoa yeah)  
We've got the magic, deep in our souls (yeah)  
We've got the magic, to play rock-n-roll  
We've got the magic, we'll never grow old  
We've got the magic  
We've got the magic  
We've got the magic  
You've got the magic  
So take it on home  
We've got the magic, deep in our souls  
We've got the magic, to play rock-n-roll  
We've got the magic, it's magic, magic (whoa-oh)  
  
  

Life's been good  
Life's been bad  
Now I know  
What I had  
Has taken it's toll on me  
  
Yes we give  
And we take  
What we get  
Is what we make  
Believe that dreams come true  
  
Life is crazy  
We're not fools, no, no  
  
The price is high  
When you keep the score  
Take your souls  
And your goals  
To the top  
  
Together we stand  
We won't take no more  
Cause we're winners  
And winners take all  
  
Together we stand  
We won't take no more  
Cause we're winners  
And winners take all  
  
We have loved  
Burned by fate  
But for once  
Set the record straight  
Time does heal all wounds  
  
You have laughed  
We have cried  
Paid our dues  
Yes we're turned the tide  
Mistakes are far and few  
  
We need no guidance  
Our aim is true  
  
Down the road  
There were many tolls  
But we know  
Cause we've grown  
What we need  
  
Together we stand  
We won't take no more  
Cause we're winners  
And winners take all  
  
Together we stand  
We won't take no more  
Cause we're winners  
And winners take all  
  
The price is high  
When you keep the score  
Take your souls  
And your goals  
To the top  
  
Together we stand  
We won't take no more  
Cause we're winners  
And winners take all  
  
Together we stand  
We won't take no more  
Cause we're winners  
And winners take all  
  
Na, na, na-na-na na-na

Na, na, na-na-na na-na  
Na-na, na-na-na-na  
Na-na-na, na  
  
Na, na, na-na-na na-na  
Na-na, na-na-na-na  
Na-na-na, na  
  
Na, na, na-na-na na-na

Tiger eyes  
Just as wild as you make me feel  
Tantalize  
Make my designs hard to conceal  
Trying hard to hold on to you  
Waterfall in my hand you're slippin' through  
Tried so hard it makes me scream  
Can't you see that you're drivin' me crazy  
I don't know what to do  
All you do is you're drivin' me crazy  
It makes me feel so good, so good, so good  
Will you stay and give me time to work it out  
Day by day  
Lose my mind without a doubt  
Don't want to hang you up this way  
Just wanna lay you down and play  
I'm gonna go out of my mind  
Can't you see that you're drivin' me crazy  
I don't know what to do  
All you do is you're drivin' me crazy  
It makes me feel so good, so good, so good  
Can't you see that you're drivin' me crazy (you're drivin' me crazy)  
I don't know what to do  
All you do is you're drivin' me crazy (you're drivin' me crazy)  
It makes me feel so good  
Can't you see that you're drivin' me crazy (you're drivin' me crazy)  
I don't know what to do  
All you do is you're drivin' me crazy (you're drivin' me crazy)  
It makes me feel so good  
Can't you see that you're drivin' me crazy (you're drivin' me crazy)  
I don't know what to do
