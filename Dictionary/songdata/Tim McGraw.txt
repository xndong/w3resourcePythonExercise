Long ago far away  
I felt your lovin' glow upon my face  
Was it a dream or just a promise made  
What is my destiny  
Someday I'll find a way to shine  
Leave all these rainy days behind  
I know there's got to be  
Some place warm and bright for me  
I'm runnin' out of places I can run  
Lookin' for a place in the sun  
Darkness hangs overhead  
Close to the point where angels fear to tread  
I close my eyes and think of you instead  
And pray you'll be here soon  
Someday I'll find a way to shine  
Leave all these rainy days behind  
I know there's got to be  
Some place warm and bright for me  
I'm runnin' out of places I can run  
Lookin' for a place in the sun  
Sometimes it feels like this whole world's against me  
And every beaten path is just another winding road  
That tempts me far from you and all that's true  
I've got to find my way again  
Someday I'll find a way to shine  
Leave all these rainy days behind  
I know there's got to be  
Some place warm and bright for me  
I'm runnin' out of places I can run  
Lookin' for a place in the sun  
I'm runnin' out of places I can run  
Lookin' for a place in the sun  
Just shine down on me sunshine

I've lead a lifetime fightin' this land  
Workin' for nothin with these dry, callused hands  
I'm a slave to the sun, it ain't cuttin' me no slack  
Gets me beggin' whenever I look back  
  
Ain't no glory in this livin'  
Ain't no runnin' from your sins  
I hope there's angels where I'm goin'  
Ain't no angels where I've been  
  
Three generations countin' on me  
To work this farm keep it in the family  
Well, I've done all I can and it's past becomin' clear  
That I can't hold out much longer here  
  
Ain't no glory in this livin'  
Ain't no runnin' from your sins  
I hope there's angels where I'm goin'  
Ain't no angels where I've been  
  
Ain't no glory in this livin'  
Ain't no runnin' from your sins  
I hope there's angels where I'm goin'  
Ain't no angels where I've been  
Ain't no angels where I've been

I just want to get a little more out of my payday  
Finally own a car that doesn't break down on the freeway  
A little vacation, ain't asking very much  
  
I keep coming home to this old broken down apartment  
I wish I had a dime for every hole that's in the carpet  
Well I don't want it all, but I ain't got enough  
  
[CHORUS]  
All I want is a life  
To drink from the glass from the well that ain't dry  
I'm sick of the crumbs I want a piece of that pie  
All I want is a life  
  
I don't mind the hours and the pain that comes from workin'  
But it's enough to kill me when I see my baby hurtin'  
Want to give her that diamond, I never got to buy  
She keeps tellin' me that everything is getting better  
But one step up the wrung and someone knocks me off the ladder  
Just want to break even someday before I die  
  
All I want is a life  
To drink from the glass from the well that ain't dry  
I'm sick of the crumbs I want a piece of that pie  
All I want is a life  
  
All I want is a life  
To drink from the glass from the well that ain't dry  
I'm sick of the crumbs I want a piece of that pie  
All I want is a life

Say exactly how you feel  
Right now you're free to say it all  
There is no one here to judge you I only love you  
You're free to close your eyes and fall  
You can trust me this is real  
Say exactly how you feel  
  
[Chorus]  
Tell me all your dreams  
What you think love means  
We'll lock the world outside  
Embrace the gift of time  
Promising forever  
Knowing that this moment might be  
All we ever find  
  
Every breath of who you are  
Tells a story that I love  
I have finally found the truth in what I see in you  
And what I feel with every touch  
The simple beauty of your heart  
In every breath of who you are  
  
[Chorus: Repeat 2X]  
  
Promising forever  
Knowing that this moment might be  
All we ever find

My mother said there's only one way  
A sweet angel boy, narrow and straight  
Timing his past, teachings they fade  
Now their angel boy has gone astray  
  
I've felt the hand of the Devil, felt his breath on my skin  
Dip me into the water, wash me again  
Can I still be forgiven for all of these things  
Or have I gone too far now  
Have I lost my wings  
  
I found a priest, I spoke my mind  
Asked if I'd sinned one too many times  
He said "My son, you're only a man"  
Then I said, "Sir, you don't understand"  
  
I've felt the hand of the Devil, felt his breath on my skin  
Dip me into the water, wash me again  
Can I still be forgiven for all of these things  
Or have I gone too far now  
Have I lost my wings  
  
God help us all for what we have done  
We've lost our way, we can't find the Son  
We make our beds, we seal our fate  
Is there still time, or is it too late  
  
We've felt the hand of the Devil, felt his breath our my skin  
Dip us into the water, wash us again  
Can we still be forgiven for all of these things  
Or have we gone too far now  
Have we lost our wings  
  
We've felt the hand of the Devil, felt his breath our my skin  
Dip us into the water, wash us again  
Can we still be forgiven for all of these things  
Or have we gone too far now  
Have we lost our wings  
  
Have we lost our wings

I was running late again, picking up a few things  
And there you were on isle 13.  
I felt that old rush, when you saw me you blushed  
Like you did when you were sweet sixteen.  
They said you looked lost on the dance floor,  
With a lonely look in your eyes.  
Don't know why I didn't show, to this day I still don't know  
For once I wish I hadn't thought twice.  
Then your folks split up and you moved to Colorado,  
And I headed out to Tennessee.  
Heard you got married and you moved back home,  
Here we are again, you and me.  
  
It's no surprise the light in your little girl's eyes,  
Shines like the ring on your hand.  
Annie, I owe you a dance.  
  
Don't the years fly by in the blink of an eye,  
Yeah loves, I've had a few.  
I've been a million places and I've seen a million faces,  
But I couldn't stop thinking 'bout you.  
Remember how we'd talk for hours, keeping each other's secrets,  
Made a promise I'd take you to homecoming,  
But Annie I didn't keep it.  
Almost called you up, when I played it bolder,  
But I thought I'd just let it be.  
Heard you found yourself a real good man,  
Do you ever think of you and me?  
  
It's no surprise the light in your little girl's eyes,  
Shines like the ring on your hand.  
Annie, I owe you a dance.  
  
So put your groceries in the basket, I'm so sorry, now I'm asking  
Like I should have twenty years ago.  
And I know it's all over, I'm just looking for some closure,  
And there's a song on the radio.  
You give me your hand and we start to dance,  
The cashier gives us a smile.  
As you turn and walk away, I hear your little girl say  
"Momma, who was that guy?"  
I shouldn't be surprised, look forgiveness in your eyes,  
Gave me a second chance.  
Annie, thanks for the dance.

I don't know why I act the way I do  
Like I ain't got a single thing to lose  
Sometimes I'm my own worst enemy  
I guess that's just the cowboy in me  
  
I got a life that most would love to have  
But sometimes I still wake up fightin' mad  
At where this road I'm heading down might lead  
I guess that's just the cowboy in me  
  
The urge to run, the restlessness  
The heart of stone I sometimes get  
The things I've done for foolish pride  
The me that's never satisfied  
The face that's in the mirror when I don't like what I see  
I guess that's just the cowboy in me  
  
The urge to run, the restlessness  
The heart of stone I sometimes get  
The things I've done for foolish pride  
The me that's never satisfied  
The face that's in the mirror when I don't like what I see  
I guess that's just the cowboy in me  
  
Girl I know there's times you must have thought  
There ain't a line you've drawn I haven't crossed  
But you set your mind to see this love on through  
I guess that's just the cowboy in you  
  
We ride and never worry about the fall  
I guess that's just the cowboy in us all

Sex and the city and Indian food,  
I never tried 'em, not until you,  
But lord it's lookin' like you left me with some habits I can't break.  
I feel kinda guilty whenever I cuss  
I lay in bed at night and I think about us  
Maybe it's because of all the love you taught me how to make  
  
You changed me, baby  
And given enough time, girl, you might have saved me  
But then again you might have just gone crazy  
Tryin' to love a music man  
Don't worry, honey  
I understand why you went runnin' from me  
I guess, I really should have seen it comin'  
I'll always die by my own hand  
  
Ran into your daddy last Saturday night  
I had to admit it he might have been right  
Oh, all the times he told me that you're just too good for me  
  
You changed me, baby  
And given enough time, girl, you might have saved me  
But then again you might have just gone crazy  
Tryin' to love a music man  
Don't worry, honey  
I understand why you went runnin' from me  
I guess, I really should have seen it comin'  
I'll always die by my own hand  
  
Oh, you changed me, baby  
And given enough time, girl, you might have saved me  
But then again you might have just gone crazy  
Tryin' to love a music man  
Don't worry, honey  
I understand why you went runnin' from me  
I guess, I really should have seen it comin'  
I'll always die by my own hand  
  
Girl, I don't blame you for nothin'  
I'll always die by my own hand

I thought that was your voice  
I thought that was my car  
Now we ain't ever met before  
But I know who you are  
You're living in my house  
And I'm living in a tent  
And don't laugh, this second job of mine  
Is paying both our rents  
You're out here buying 'Happy Meals'  
And I'm eating rice and pintos  
You so much as crack a smile at me, man  
I'll come through this here window  
  
Well you took my wife  
And you took my kids  
And you took that life  
That I used to live  
My pride, the pool, the boat, my tools, my dreams, the dog, the cat  
Yeah I think that's just about everything  
Oh I almost forgot  
Do you want fries with that?  
  
Your ketchup's in the bag  
And a check is in the mail  
I hope your chicken's raw inside  
And I hope your bun is stale  
I'm supposed to tell you  
"Please come back"  
But how bout this instead?  
I hope you both choke on a pickle  
Man, that would tickle me to death  
I don't know what you're waiting on  
You're holding up the line  
Oh man, you ain't got no change coming back  
Are you out of your mind?  
  
Well you took my wife  
And you took my kids  
And you took that life  
That I used to live  
My pride, the pool, the boat, my tools, my dreams, the dog, the cat  
Yeah I think that's all there is  
Do you want fries with that?  
  
Well you took my wife  
And you took my kids  
And you stole that life  
That I used to live  
My pride, the pool, the boat, my tools, my dreams, the dog, the cat  
Yeah I think that about covers it  
Do you want fries with that?

Mister can you take me into Little Rock  
I'll buy the coffee and I'll fill your truck  
I'll listen all night if you want to talk  
Just don't mention Memphis  
We can talk about your family  
Politics, music and philosophy  
Any ol' subject's alright with me  
Just don't mention Memphis  
  
[Chorus:]  
Or blue eyes, and light brown hair  
An angel waving to me from the top of the stairs  
The hardest thing I did was leave her standing there  
So don't mention Memphis  
  
Pass me the thermos and I'll fill your cup  
We'll make Texas with a little luck  
And I'm hanging with you till the sun comes up  
So don't mention Memphis  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I don't wanna talk about Memphis  
And the hardest thing I did was leave my baby there  
So don't mention Memphis  
I don't wanna talk about Memphis

Johnny's daddy was taking him fishin'  
When he was eight years old  
  
Little girl came through the front gate  
Holdin' a fishin' pole  
His dad looked down and smiled  
He said, "We can't leave her behind"  
"Son, I know you don't want her to go  
But someday you'll change your mind"  
And Johnny said  
"Take Jimmy Johnson  
Take Tommy Thompson  
Take my best friend, Bo  
Take anybody that you want as  
Long as she don't go  
Take any boy in the world  
Daddy please, don't take the girl"  
  
Same old boy, same sweet girl  
Ten years down the road  
He held her tight and kissed her lips in  
Front of the picture show  
Stranger came and pulled a gun  
Grabbed her by the arm said  
"If you do what I tell you to  
There won't be any harm"  
And Johnny said "Take my money  
Take my wallet  
Take my credit cards  
Here's the watch that my Grandpa gave me  
Here's the key to my car  
Mister give it a whirl  
But please don't take the girl"  
  
Same old boy  
Same sweet girl  
Five years down the road  
There's gonna be a little one and she  
Says it's time to go  
Doctor says the baby's fine  
But you'll have to leave  
'Cause his momma's fading fast and  
Johnny hit his knees and there he prayed  
"Take the very breath you gave me  
Take the heart from my chest  
I'll gladly take her place if you'll let me  
Make this my last request  
Take me out of this world  
God, please don't take the girl"  
  
Johnny's daddy  
Was taking him fishin'  
When he was eight years old

Every Friday night there's a steady cloud of dust  
That leads back to a field filled with pickup trucks  
It's got old Hank crankin' way up loud  
Got coolers in the back, tailgates down  
There's a big fire burning but don't be alarmed  
It's just country boys and girls getting down on the farm  
  
Well you can come as you are, there ain't no dress code  
Just some rural route rules that you need to know  
Don't mess with the bull he can get real mean  
Don't forget to shut the gate stay out of the green  
If it starts to raining will just head to the barn  
Where country boys and girls are getting down on the farm  
  
You can have a lot of fun in a New York minute  
But there's some things you can do outside those city limits  
Ain't no closing time, ain't no cover charge  
Just country boys and girls getting down on the farm  
  
Ed's been on his tractor ain't seen Becky all week  
Somebody said they seen em heading down to the creek  
Farmer Johnson's daughters just pulled up in a jeep  
Man he knows how to grow em if ya know what I mean  
Old Dave's gettin' loud but he don't mean no harm  
It's just country boys and girls getting down on the farm  
  
Ah let's get down y'all  
Stay out of that hay

In my home town for anyone who sticks around  
You're either lost or you're found  
There's not much in between  
In my home town everything's still black and white  
It's a long long way from wrong to right  
From Sunday morning to Saturday night  
  
Everybody just wants to get high  
Sit and watch a perfect world go by  
We're all looking for love and meaning in our lives  
We follow the roads that lead us  
To drugs or Jesus  
  
My whole life, I've tried to run, I've tried to hide  
From the stained-glass windows in my mind  
Refusing to let God's light shine down on me, down on me  
Everybody just wants to get high  
Sit and watch a perfect world go by  
We're all looking for love and meaning in our lives  
There's not much space between us  
Drugs or Jesus  
  
Everybody wants acceptance, we all just want some proof  
Everyone's just looking for the truth  
Everybody just wants to get high  
Sit and watch a perfect world go by  
We're all looking for love and meaning in our lives  
We follow the roads that lead us  
To drugs or Jesus  
Oh, I need you Jesus  
Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah!  
  
Hallelujah...

Well Joe got a promotion  
He's up there on top  
Everybody was cheerin' him on  
He deserves everything he's got  
  
Guess who's the new talk of the town  
The new S.O.B.  
The one everybody loves cuttin' down  
Man it's a sight to see  
They all smile right to his face, and hide the jealousy  
Me I'm just working hard to get to that place  
Where everybody hates me  
  
(Now check this out)  
  
Well Bill got a promotion  
He knocked Joe back down  
Now Joe's everybody's long lost friend (laugh)  
He's back in the crowd  
  
Guess who's the new talk of the town  
The new S.O.B.  
The one everybody loves cuttin' down  
Man it's a sight to see  
They all smile right to his face, and hide the jealousy  
Me I'm just working hard to get to that place  
Where everybody hates me  
  
Well everybody wants to be the big dog  
Want to wag that big dog tail  
But 'til they are they want to see the big dog fail  
  
You pay your dues and you get your breaks  
Then your the S.O.B.  
The one everybody loves to hate  
It just comes naturally  
They all smile right to your face, and hide the jealousy  
That's just the way it goes and I can't wait  
'Til everybody hates me

We were born in this little town  
Growin' up I was countin' down  
Every single day  
'Til we made our get away  
But you said you could never see yourself  
Tryin' to make a life anywhere else  
This would be your home  
And I was on my own  
  
But ever since you said good bye  
I've been out here on the wind  
And baby you would be surprised  
All the places you have been  
I've seen you in  
  
[Chorus]  
Albuquerque  
Waitin' out a blizzard  
Arizona  
Dancin' 'cross the desert  
Watchin' the sun set in Monterey  
Girl I swear just the other day you were  
Down in Georgia  
Pickin' them peaches  
In Carolina  
Barefoot on the beaches  
No matter where you choose to be  
In my heart I'll always see you  
  
Everywhere  
  
Now days  
When I'm passin' through  
The conversation always turns to you  
And I hear you're doin' fine  
Livin' out by the county line  
Got a man that's home every night  
A couple of kids and the kind of life  
That you want to lead  
Guess you could say the same for me  
But you and I  
Made our choices  
All those years ago  
Still I know  
I'll hear your voice  
And see you down the road  
  
Maybe in  
Oklahoma  
Drivin' 'cross the prairie  
In Dallas, Texas  
Isn't that where we  
Always said we would  
Like to try  
Never did  
So maybe that's why you're on  
Every highway  
Just beyond the high-beams  
Right beside me  
In all of my sweet dreams  
No matter where you choose to be  
In my heart I'll always see you  
In  
  
[Chorus]

He was rough he was tough  
And he drank his whiskey straight  
He would fight every night  
If he didn't get his way  
She was kind she could find  
All the good in everyone  
And then one day she passed his way  
He felt reborn in that morning sun  
He saw her face she caught his name  
And from that moment  
He knew he'd never be the same  
  
What you can find in the eyes of a woman  
Is a reason to believe  
Look deep inside the eyes of a woman  
See the man you want to be  
  
Now I've been down kicked around  
The world had got the best of me  
Out of rope little hope  
I never get back on my feet  
She took my hand said yes you can  
One look at her and I'm a brand new man  
  
What you can find in the eyes of a woman  
Is a reason to believe  
Look deep inside the eyes of a woman  
See the man you want to be  
  
Oh when I feel the need for inspiration  
With just one look I found my salvation  
  
What you can find in the eyes of a woman  
Is a reason to believe  
Look deep inside the eyes of a woman  
See the man you want to be  
See the man you want to be  
See the man see the man you want to be

Hot sun, dancin' on the river  
We'd sit on the bank and watch the world roll by  
Our feet in the water, she'd press her lips to mine  
We were so long on love but short on time  
She could be honeymoon sweet and a little wild  
And she was mine for a little while  
  
I laugh every time when I think about us  
We sent the summer out in style  
She's gone but she left me with a smile  
Cause she was mine for a little while  
  
We'd take a drive and park down next to airport road  
Put the seats back and watch the planes leave town  
She always said nobody's strong enough to tie her down  
But I wasn't lookin' for that anyhow  
I knew she'd leave but I didn't know when  
It matters, but didn't back then  
  
I laugh when I start to think about us  
We sent the summer out in style  
She's gone but she left me with a smile  
?Cause she was mine for a little while  
  
I keep seeing pictures now of me and her  
And those summer nights  
My minds filled with her, oh and it's alright  
  
I laugh when I start to think about us  
We sent the summer out in style  
She's gone but she left me with a smile  
?Cause she was mine for a little while

Let's be honest, you're not flawless  
But you're as close as anything I've seen  
You're not the woman that you envisioned  
But your life is not a broken time machine  
No, it's not that bad  
No, it's really not that bad  
  
A little midnight chardonnay  
Smooth the edges off the day  
A little taste of Mary Jane  
Makes you feel young again  
All those years around your eyes  
Always take you by surprise  
You've been living in a dream  
Forever 17  
  
A reckless lover, a father figure  
You search for both in every man you meet  
You're not a mother but sometimes you wonder  
If a son or daughter just might make you feel complete  
But no, you don't need someone else  
No, it's hard enough to learn to love yourself  
  
A little midnight chardonnay  
Smooth the edges off the day  
A little taste of Mary Jane  
Makes you feel young again  
All those years around your eyes  
Always take you by surprise  
You've been living in a dream  
Forever 17  
  
Little midnight chardonnay  
Smooth the edges off the day  
A little taste of Mary Jane  
Makes you feel young again  
All those years around your eyes  
Always take you by surprise  
You've been living in a dream  
Forever, forever 17

I'm gonna drive on out  
To the river tonight  
Find a quiet spot  
Turn on my parking lights  
I'm gonna drink some beers  
Try to catch a buzz  
Turn my radio up  
And forget about us  
  
I'm gonna lay me down  
On the hood of this car  
Make another wish  
Upon a falling star  
I'm gonna think again  
About the way it was  
I'm gonna close my eyes  
And forget about us  
  
[Chorus:]  
I know it won't be easy  
But I've got a plan  
To just let my memory let go of your hand  
I'm gonna miss your touch  
But I know I must  
Forget about us  
  
When the morning sun  
Burns across my face  
I'll put my shirt back on  
Get up and walk away  
I'm gonna climb my frame  
Onto a greyhound bus  
Take a little blue pill  
And forget about us  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
By the time I get to Phoenix  
I won't know your name  
Those soft green eyes  
Warm skin  
And the way you say good morning  
And I'll be alright

I heard it from a friend of a friend  
You're livin' out in LA now  
Got a studio apartment, couple blocks off the beach  
Doing yoga in the evenings, you love the kids you teach  
  
I heard it from a friend of a friend  
You met somebody in a coffee shop  
You've been goin' out now, for goin' on ten months  
You already met his family, things are heatin' up  
  
Don't you believe, anything you hear  
When someone tells you, I still ask about you  
After all these years  
No matter what they say, it's just not true  
I don't spend all my days and all my nights  
Just missin' you  
  
I heard it from a friend of a friend  
You looked amazing in that long white gown  
With flowers in your hair, barefoot in the sand  
Your daddy almost broke down when he gave away your hand  
  
But don't you believe, anything you hear  
When someone tells you, I still ask about you  
After all these years  
No matter what they say, it's just not true  
I don't spend all my days and all my nights  
Just missin' you  
  
I heard it from a friend of a friend  
He didn't mean it when he took those vows  
You've been stayin' with your mama, a couple weeks now  
Been asking everybody about me  
  
I heard it from a friend of a friend  
I heard it from a friend of a friend

Jesse called her best friend Jenny  
Said we're goin' out tonight  
Gonna chase the moon  
Right out of the sky  
We're gonna drink Boone's Farm  
Like we were seventeen again  
You can't say no  
As long as we've been friends  
  
Good girls  
Always walk the line  
Good Girls  
Never let you seem them cry  
  
Took off like a bottle rocket  
Through a field of corn  
And hell hath no fury  
Like a woman scorned  
Then Jesse lit a cigarette and said  
My man's been sleepin' around  
And I know who it is  
And Jenny's head fell down  
  
Good girls  
Always walk the line  
Good girls  
Never let you see them cry  
  
Next mornin' the paper read  
Two killed in a fatal crash  
The train never had time to stop  
They were parked right on the tracks  
The only witness was  
A weeping willow on a faraway hill when  
Jesse told Jenny  
Hey if I can't have him neither one of us will  
  
Good Girls  
Always walk the line  
Good Girls  
Never let you see them cry  
  
Cry, cry, cry, cry  
  
Jesse called her best friend Jenny  
Said we're goin' out tonight  
Gonna chase the moon  
Right out of the sky

I pulled into the shopping center  
And saw a little boy wrapped around the legs of his mother  
Like ice cream melting, they embraced  
Years of bad decisions running down her face  
All morning I'd been thinking my life's so hard  
And they wore everything they owned, living in a car  
I wanted to tell them it would be ok  
But I just got in my Suburban, and I, I drove away  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't know why they say grown men don't cry  
I don't know why they say grown men don't cry  
  
Keep having this dream about my old man  
I'm ten years old and he's holding my hand  
We're talking on the front porch watching the sun go down  
But it was just a dream, he was a slave to his job and he couldn't be around  
So many things I want to say to him  
I just placed a rose on his grave and I talked to the wind  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm sitting here with my kids and my wife and everything that I hold dear in
my life  
We say Grace and thank the Lord, got so much to be thankful for  
Then its up the stairs and off to bed  
And my little girl says "I haven't had my story yet"  
Everything weighing on my mind disappears, just like that  
When she lifts her head off her pillow and says, "I love you dad"  
  
[Chorus]

Let's just cut it down the middle  
Let it bleed and bleed out  
I'll clean up the mess, baby  
You stand there and shout, cry, cry  
Baby, I can't hold us together  
  
Paint me in a corner  
Cover me with rage  
I'll take it like a circus lion  
Silent in my cage, cry, cry  
Baby, I can't change the weather  
  
Baby, I'll let go when you say so  
Try to let your heart fly free  
I'll crawl out of my cradle  
Down in to my black hole  
And you just lay low  
Under your halo  
  
I'll slip into the back room  
Fall onto your cast  
Almost out of focus  
Like a faded photograph, cry, cry  
Baby, I'm all out of answers  
  
Baby, I'll let go when you say so  
Try to let your heart fly free  
I'll crawl out of my cradle  
Down in to my black hole  
And you just lay low  
Under your halo  
  
Baby, I'll let go when you say so  
Try to let your heart fly free  
I'll crawl out of my cradle  
Down in to my black hole  
And you just lay low  
Under your halo  
  
Bab, you just lay low  
Under your halo

I gave up pimento cheese  
Domino's delivery  
Whiskey sours  
Apple pies  
Finger-lickin' chicken fried  
Are gastronomic history  
I used to like them scary shows  
But I gave 'em up a while ago  
Don't do no dip-defyin'  
Roller coaster ridin'  
Nowadays, I just take it slow  
Every since we started datin'  
I been compensatin'  
To keep from gettin' up  
To hell any quicker  
'Cause  
  
[Chorus]  
She's hard on the ticker  
Hard on the ticker  
The girl is such a hazard that she ought to have a sticker  
Sayin' hard on the ticker  
  
Now, when she wiggles through my door  
My chin gets heavy, hits the floor  
Silky hair, garnet lips  
Swingin' double-jointed hips  
My blood begins to roar  
And when she nibbles on me ear  
It's partly pleasure, partly beer  
Little dab is all it takes  
To get my heart a palpatatin'  
Feelin' like the end is near  
I ought to get a policy  
A double indemnity  
It'd make my beneficiary  
A whole lot richer  
'Cause...  
  
[Chorus]  
  
That's my girl  
Yeah, she's hard on the ticker  
I ought to get a policy  
A double indemnity  
It'd make my beneficiary  
A whole lot richer  
  
Because she's hard on the ticker  
Hard on the ticker  
The girl is such a hazard that she ought to have a sticker  
Sayin' hard on the ticker  
  
Oh, she's hard on the ticker  
Hard on the ticker  
She's hard on the ticker  
Hey, she's hard on the ticker

On a night like this  
Ain't what I'm lookin' for  
The music's slow and the beer is warm  
You came in the room  
Put that record on  
Started groovin' to that funky song  
  
And I said, hey now,  
It don't seem that late now  
I thought the party was windin' down  
Hey now look what I just found  
Gonna stay now  
Bring the Tanqueray, I'll  
See how this plays out  
Until you looked at me  
I was just about to leave  
I was just about to leave  
  
Watch dancin' there,  
Lit the whole place up,  
Made me wonder where you came from, yeah  
Some kinda paradise,  
Some kind of heaven sent,  
I know it might 2 a.m.  
  
But hey now,  
It don't seem that late now  
I thought the party was windin' down  
But hey now look what I just found  
Gonna stay now  
Bring the Tanqueray, I'll  
See how this plays out  
Until you looked at me  
I was just about to leave  
I was just about to leave  
  
When I saw you, going for your keys  
Girl I had to ask you if you'd dance with me  
Yeah would you dance with me  
  
You said, hey now,  
It don't seem that late now  
I thought the party was windin' down  
But hey now look what I just found  
Gonna stay now  
Bring the Tanqueray, I'll  
See how this plays out  
Until you looked at me  
I was just about to  
  
Hey now,  
It don't seem that late now  
I thought the party was windin' down  
But hey now look what I just found  
Gonna stay now  
Bring the Tanqueray, I'll  
See how this plays out  
Until you looked at me  
I was just about to leave  
I was just about to leave  
  
Ooh but hey now, hey now  
Oh hey now, hey now  
Look what I just found  
Look what I just found  
Gonna dance, gonna dance, gonna stay  
Gonna do just about everything

It looks a little weathered, so it looks good on me  
But since you've left I'm wearin' this old hat differently  
Pain, wind, rain and sun, it keeps out all but one  
  
So I keep the brim pulled down  
Whenever those teardrops come around  
So nobody else can see  
Just what your memory does to me  
I know I can't hide  
But baby, I've still got my pride  
When your memory comes back  
I keep it under my hat  
  
Last night, I thought I'd go out  
I don't know where my head was at  
I had to turn around  
Go back and get my hat  
And I was glad I did  
When I saw you with him  
  
I kept the brim pulled down  
Whenever those teardrops came around  
So nobody else could see  
Just what your memory does to me  
I know I can't hide  
But, baby, I've still got my pride  
When your memory comes back  
I keep it under my hat  
  
When your memory comes back  
I keep it under my hat

It's been a long time  
Since we walked down that aisle together  
And you became my wife  
And who would've thought You would fall for someone just like me  
For the best days of my life  
  
I may not be a poet  
'Cause I ain't so good on words  
I may not stand before you like a knight  
In shining armor  
I may not be the best of singers  
There's better guys I've heard  
But I know how to love, I know how to  
Love you well  
  
You got your faults  
And I don't need to tell you I've got mine  
But I guess they all even out  
Wherever I ride  
The thought of you turns water into wine  
And somehow I lose a crowd  
  
I may not drive a fancy car  
I don't know what it's for  
I may not be the one who gets to  
Shower you with diamonds  
I may not be a rich man but you can't  
Call me poor  
'Cause I know how to love, I know how  
To love you well  
  
And as we skip the light fandango  
From that ole jukebox by the bar  
Now honey don't it make you wonder  
How we ever got this far  
  
I may not be a poet  
'Cause I ain't got much to say  
I may not stand before you like that  
Knight in shining armor  
I may not be the best of singers  
Honey that's o.k.  
'Cause I know how to love  
I know how to love  
I know how to love you well

I wanna drink that shot of whiskey  
I wanna smoke that cigarette  
I wanna smell that sweet addiction on my breath  
I wanna ride 'cross West Virginia  
In the backseat of a Cadillac  
You know some cowboys like me go out like that  
So I need you  
  
Like a needle needs a vein  
Like my Uncle Joe in Oklahoma needs the rain  
I need you  
Like a lighthouse on the coast  
Like the Father and the Son need the Holy Ghost  
I need you  
  
I wanna get lost in some corner booth  
A cantina in Mexico  
I wanna dance to the static of an AM radio  
I wanna wrap the moon around us  
And lay beside you skin on skin  
Make love till the sun comes up till sun goes down again  
'Cause I need you  
  
Like a needle needs a vein  
Like my Uncle Joe in Oklahoma needs the rain  
I need you  
Like a lighthouse on the coast  
Like the Father and the Son need the Holy Ghost  
I need you  
  
Oh, I need you  
  
I wanna drink that shot of whiskey  
I wanna smoke that cigarette  
You know some cowboys like me go out like that  
So I need you  
Oh, I need you  
I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you  
  
Ooo, I need you, I need you, I need you  
I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you, too

If I died today,  
Who'd turn off my coffee pot?  
Would there be a street parade?  
Would I just be an after-thought?  
  
If I died today,  
Would I still be a waiter?  
Could I fly around like superman?  
Would I make the Sunday paper?  
  
[Chorus]  
I wonder who I'd see,  
Cryin' standin' over me.  
Who would just send their regards?  
Would anybody say that "at least he's in a better place?"  
And who would get this old guitar?  
  
If I died today,  
Would my mama keep on prayin'?  
Would my buddies go out drinkin'?  
Would my alarm clock keep on blinkin'?  
  
And if I died today,  
Would I need to be ashamed?  
Would I be easy to forget?  
Could I live with my regrets?  
  
I wonder who I'd see,  
Cryin' standin' over me.  
Who would just send their regards?  
Would anybody say that "the world will never be the same"  
And who would get this old guitar?  
  
If I died today,  
Would I see my room from Heaven?  
Would my family talk about me,  
Every Christmas and Thanksgivin'?  
  
I wonder who I'd see,  
Cryin' standin' over me.  
Who would just send their regards?  
Would anybody say that "what a good guy what a shame"  
And who would get this old guitar?  
  
If I died today,  
Who'd turn off my coffee pot?

If you're reading this  
My mama's sitting there  
Looks like I only got a one-way ticket over here  
I sure wish I could give you one more kiss  
And war was just a game we played when we were kids  
Well, I'm laying down my gun  
I'm hanging up my boots  
I'm up here with God  
And we're both watching over you  
  
[Chorus]  
So lay me down  
In that open field out on the edge of town  
And know my soul is where my mama always prayed that it would go  
If you're reading this, I'm already home  
  
If you're reading this  
Halfway around the world  
I won't be there to see the birth of our little girl  
I hope she looks like you  
I hope she fights like me  
She stands up for the innocent and the weak  
I'm laying down my gun  
Hanging up my boots  
Tell dad, I don't regret that I've followed in his shoes  
  
So lay me down  
In that open field out on the edge of town  
And know my soul is where my mama always prayed that it would go  
If you're reading this, I'm already home  
  
If you're reading this, there is going to come a day  
You move on and find someone else and that's okay  
Just remember this  
I'm in a better place  
Soldiers live in peace, and angels sing amazing grace  
  
So lay me down  
In that open field out on the edge of town  
And know my soul is where my mama always prayed that it would go  
If you're reading this, I'm already home

I put my money down on love again  
At a hundred to one  
I don't mind losin' I'll just try 'til I win  
Or see how close I can come  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh it should be illegal  
It gets me so high  
I can fly like an eagle  
Night after night  
  
I know people who have thrown in the towel  
Just 'cause they've lost once or twice  
But it takes a believer to put all this faith  
In the toss of the dice  
  
[Chorus: Repeat 2X]  
  
Night after night after night...

Bobby's got a duster '79  
Bottle of Jack and a forty-five  
Points it at his head  
And he starts to cry,  
To proud to ask me to save his life  
  
Billy's in a limo  
On the upper east side  
Playing Russian Roulette  
With the long white line  
His wife gets a call at three am  
Saying billy ain't never coming home again  
  
She asks me why?  
  
And I said,  
I sure wish you'd believe  
That everybody's free  
And I'll help you if you ask me to,  
I gave every star a name  
The sunshine and the rain  
But I can't decide the road you choose  
That's up to you  
I'm only Jesus  
  
Johnny had a good job  
Rackin' it in  
Caviar parties  
With his well to do friends  
Something was missing  
From his perfect little life  
He through in the towel  
And he called me one night  
  
Betty was an orphan  
Like so many kids  
They taught her in school  
That I didn't exist  
She had every reason not to talk to me  
But every night before bed  
She got down on her knees  
Just to tell me hi  
  
And I said,  
I'm sure glad you believe  
Cause everybody's free  
And I'll help you if you ask me to,  
I gave every star a name  
The sun shine and the rain  
But I can't decide the road you choose  
That's up to you  
I'm only Jesus  
  
Hey your all the same to me  
Everybody's free  
And I'll help you if you ask me to,  
I gave every star a name  
The sun shine and the rain  
But I can't decide the road you choose  
That's up to you  
I'm only Jesus  
  
I'm only Jesus  
I'm only Jesus  
  
Gotta have Jesus to see the light  
Gotta have Jesus to hold you tight  
Gotta have Jesus to talk to me  
I gotta have Jesus to set me free

[Chorus]  
I'm an Indian outlaw  
Half Cherokee and Choctaw  
My baby she's a Chippewa  
She's one of a kind  
  
All my friends call me Bear Claw  
Village cheatin' is my paw-paw  
He gets his orders from my maw-may  
She makes him walk the line  
  
You can find me in my wigwam  
I'll be beatin' on my tom-tom  
Pull out the pipe and smoke you some  
Hey and pass it around  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I ain't lookin' for trouble  
We can ride my pony double  
Make your little heart bubble  
Like a glass of wine  
  
I remember the medicine man  
He caught runnin' water in my hands  
Drug me 'round by my headband  
Said I wasn't the kind  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I can kill a deer or buffalo  
With just my arrow and my hickory bow  
From a hundred yards don't you know  
I do it all the time  
  
They all gather 'round my teepee  
Late at night tryin' to catch a peek  
At me in nothin' but my buffalo briefs  
I got em standin' in line  
  
[Chorus]

Now mama I know you've always wished me the best  
And I've found somebody and I think she's gonna pass the test  
She's a country girl as far as I can see  
Mama I hope she's what you had in mind for me  
  
She likes to go skinny dippin' in the heat of the day  
And late at night she wants to roll in the hay  
She cranks my tractor with just one kiss  
Mama it doesn't get any countrier than this  
  
Now mama I know she didn't grow up on a farm  
But she sure knows her way around out behind the barn  
And it ain't exactly chores she does at dawn  
But she says she's gonna run me till the cows come home  
  
She likes to go skinny dippin' in the heat of the day  
And late at night she wants to roll in the hay  
She cranks my tractor with just one kiss  
Mama it doesn't get any countrier than this  
  
She likes to go skinny dippin' in the heat of the day  
And late at night she wants to roll in the hay  
She cranks my tractor with just one kiss  
Mama it doesn't get any countrier than this  
Yeah, mama it doesn't get any countrier than this

Dancing in the dark  
Middle of the night  
Taking your heart  
And holding it tight  
Emotional touch  
Touching my skin  
And askin' you to do  
What you've been doing  
All over again  
  
Oh, it's a beautiful thing  
Don't think I can keep it all in  
I've just gotta let you know  
What it is that won't let me go  
  
It's your love  
It just does something to me  
It sends a shock right through me  
I can't get enough  
And if you wonder  
About the spell I'm under  
Oh it's your love  
  
Better than I was  
More than I am  
And all of this happened  
By taking your hand  
And who I am now  
Is who I wanted to be  
And now that we're together  
I'm stronger than ever, I'm happy and free  
  
Oh, it's a beautiful thing  
Don't think I can keep it all in  
And if you ask me why I've changed  
All I gotta do is say your sweet name  
  
It's your love  
It just does something to me  
It sends a shock right through me  
I can't get enough  
And if you wonder  
About the spell I'm under  
Oh it's your love  
  
Oh, it's a beautiful thing  
Don't think I can keep it all in  
I've just gotta let you know  
What it is that won't let me go  
  
It's your love  
It just does something to me  
It sends a shock right through me  
I can't get enough  
And if you wonder  
About the spell I'm under  
Oh it's your love  
It's your love  
It's your love

This is for the nobody  
The one in the crowd  
Whos got a  
Lost look on his face  
  
This is for the downtrodden  
The one that the worlds forgotten  
Waiting on a better day  
  
Well I'm in no  
Position to judge em  
Heaven knows  
Theyre just like me  
  
And im not alone  
In knowing what its like  
To wonder where your going  
In this crazy real  
  
And im not alone  
In knowing how it feels  
To pray to god  
And sometimes wonder if hes real  
Cause I've got friends that do  
  
Yeah I've got friends that do  
  
This is for the lost junkie  
Who spends all his hard earned money  
On something that he hates  
  
And this is for the found guilty  
Who aint getting out  
Until he pays his debt to the state  
  
Well I'm in no  
Position to judge em  
Heaven knows  
Theyre just like me  
  
And I may not know  
What its like  
To lose your job  
Cause a habit's got you gripped too tight  
  
And I may not know  
How it feels  
To lay your head down on a prison bed in a world of steel  
But I've got friends that do  
  
Yeah I've got friends that do  
  
This is for yours truly  
Just a little verse to remind me  
We've all got somewhere to turn  
  
And I may not know  
What its like  
To send my only son  
To save the world  
And watch him die  
  
And I may not know  
How it feels  
To hang there on the cross  
To prove that love is real  
But I've got friends that do  
  
Yeah I've got friends that do  
  
Yeah I've got friends that do  
  
You know we all got friends that do

Don't know why he does what he does, playin' lost and found with your love  
Tryin' to confuse you use you girl he gonna lose you sure enough  
Don't know why he says all those things, always shootin' down all your dreams  
He oughta know better than that, he oughta be watchin' his back, cause you
know, you know  
  
Girl I love the shine in your eyes, if only just for a moment girl I'd be
satisfied  
If I could only touch your cheek, maybe that's all I need to make my life
complete  
'Cause girl I can make you smile  
If you knew that I was here, wishin' I could just be your tear  
  
I don't know why he can't find the words, sayin' all those things you deserve  
Girl if it was me there, I swear, you know you wouldn't have to feel so unsure  
About what tomorrow might bring, girl you know I'd give everything  
If I could just hold you like him, if I could be more than just friends,
'cause you know, you know  
  
Girl I love the shine in your eyes, if only just for a moment girl I'd be
satisfied  
If I could only touch your cheek, maybe that's all I need, to make my life

If you knew that I was here, wishin' I could just be your tear

If only I could just be your tear yeah yea...

You always had an eye for things that glittered  
But I was far from bein' made of gold  
I don't know how but I scraped up the money  
I just never could quite tell you no  
Just like when you were leavin' Amarillo  
To take that new job in Tennessee  
And I quit mine so we could be together  
I can't forget the way you looked at me  
  
[Chorus]  
Just to see you smile  
I'd do anything  
That you wanted me to  
And all is said and done  
I'd never count the cost  
It's worth all that's lost  
Just to see you smile  
  
When you said time was all you really needed  
I walked away and let you have your space  
Cause leavin' didn't hurt me near as badly  
As the tears I saw rollin' down your face  
And yesterday I knew just what you wanted  
When you came walkin' up to me with him  
So I told you that I was happy for you  
And given the chance I'd lie again  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]

I'm gonna clean the house  
I'm gonna fix the fence  
With my final hours  
I'm gonna tie up these loose ends  
I won't leave a note for anyone to find  
Tomorrow they'll know what I've done here tonight  
  
The drastic steps I've taken  
Are just an act of desperation  
I knew no one would miss me, so what the hell?  
I fought, and lied, I drank too much  
Hurt everyone I've ever touched  
And just how much I've hurt you, it's hard to tell  
This is not some cry for help  
It's goodbye, I wish you well  
Because I love you I'm gonna kill myself  
  
Now who is that in my easy chair?  
Now wait a minute, that's the old me sitting there  
And I thank God, the devil in me died  
'Cause I stand before you now a man changed and alive  
  
The drastic steps I've taken  
Are just an act of desperation  
I knew no one would miss me, so what the hell?  
I fought, and lied, I drank too much  
Hurt everyone I've ever touched  
And just how much I've hurt you, it's hard to tell  
This is not some cry for help  
It's goodbye, I wish you well  
Because I love you I had to kill myself.  
  
I'm gonna clean the house  
I'm gonna fix that fence  
In my final hours, I'm gonna tie up these loose ends

I just walked in and you were gone  
To your mama's I suppose  
It looks like you won't be back, so I thought you'd ought to know  
I found that note you left today  
It only took you half a page  
I'm gonna grab my old guitar, take a pencil from the jar, fill in the empty
space  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm gonna tell you how I feel, straight-up genuine and real  
Open a bottle of ninety-proof and write a song for you  
Like Kristofferson would do  
  
In each line you're gonna hear "it's my fault" and "I miss you"  
I know it won't be in time, it may not even rhyme  
But all it has to be is true  
  
I'm gonna tell you how I feel, straight-up genuine and real  
Open a bottle of ninety-proof and write a song for you  
Like Kristofferson would do  
  
I'm gonna tell you how I feel, straight-up genuine and real  
Open a bottle of ninety-proof and write a song for you  
Like Kristofferson would do  
  
I'm gonna drink this bottle of ninety-proof and sing this song for you  
Like Kristofferson would do

I been caught sideways out here on the crossroads  
Tryin' to buy back the pieces I lost of my soul  
It's hard when the devil won't get off your back  
It's like carryin' around the past in a hundred pound sack  
  
Today, I'm gonna keep on walkin'  
I'm gonna hold my head up high  
Gonna leave it all behind  
Today, I'm gonna stand out in the rain  
Let it wash it all away, yeah, wash it all away  
I'm gonna let it go, oh, oh, oh yeah  
I'm gonna let it go, oh, oh, oh yeah  
  
Skeletons and ghosts are hidin' in the shadows  
Threatening me with all the things that they know  
Choices and mistakes - they all know my name  
I'm through holdin' in and holdin' on to all that pain  
  
Today, I'm gonna keep on walkin'  
I'm gonna hold my head up high  
Got no more tears to cry  
Today, I'm gonna stand out in the rain  
Let it wash it all away, yeah, wash it all away  
I'm gonna let it go, oh, oh, oh yeah  
I'm gonna let it go, oh, oh, oh yeah  
  
I know, I know, I know, I know I been forgiven  
I know, I know, I know, I'm gonna start livin'  
  
Today, I'm gonna keep on walkin'  
I'm gonna hold my head up high  
I'm gonna leave it all behind  
Today, I'm gonna stand out in the rain  
Let it wash it all away, yeah, wash it all away  
I'm gonna let it go, oh, oh, oh yeah  
I'm gonna let it go, oh, oh, oh yeah  
I'm gonna let it go, oh, oh, oh yeah  
  
Oh, oh, oh yeah

I know you're mad,  
And I'm to blame for that.  
Yes, I'm sorry again,  
For the things I did, the words I said,  
If I could I'd take it back.  
Why waste the wine in this glass,  
The love in this room,  
To making up, girl  
We're so good at that.  
  
Come on over, sit back down by me,  
Let me have it, take it out on me,  
Don't hold back, take your time,  
Until you forgive me.  
Turn down the lights, lock the door,  
Leave out leavin' on the floor,  
I know you're angry inside,  
Let me love it out of you tonight.  
  
I see that smile,  
You're tryin' so hard to have.  
Who you're tryin' to fool?  
I know your game, I know you girl,  
Damn you're sexy when you're playin' it cool.  
Why waste the wine in this glass,  
The love in this room,  
To making up, girl  
We're so good at that.  
  
Come on over, sit back down by me,  
Let me have it, take it out on me,  
Don't hold back, take your time,  
Until you forgive me.  
Turn down the lights, lock the door,  
Leave out leavin' on the floor,  
I know you're angry inside,  
Let me love it out of you tonight.  
  
Why waste the wine in this glass,  
The love in this room,  
To making up, girl  
We're so good at that.  
  
Come on over, sit back down by me,  
Let me have it, take it out on me,  
Don't hold back, take your time,  
Until you forgive me.  
Turn down the lights, lock the door,  
Leave out leavin' on the floor,  
I know you're angry inside,  
Let me love it out of you tonight.  
  
Let me have it, let me have it, take your time.  
Let me lay you down and hold you close,  
And tell you how much I need you.  
Let me have it, let me have it.

Sometimes I close my eyes  
And imagine you're with me  
Chasing passion into the night  
All tangled in a dream  
  
Oh if you could see my heart  
The way I feel inside  
You would know just how far  
I'm willing to go to get to you  
There is nothing I won't do  
  
Show me what its like to lose control  
Free the desire in your soul  
Oh oh let me love you  
  
Let me take you to a place like no where else  
Show you the things you never felt  
Oh oh let me love you  
  
Oh I want to taste your kiss  
Be the reason for your smile  
Touch the magic on your skin  
Be the one that drives you wild  
  
Oh if you could read my mind  
You'd know you're everything I need  
You'd see yourself through my eyes  
You may understand what I'm going through  
Just how much I want you  
  
Show me what its like to lose control  
Free the desire in your soul  
Oh oh let me love you  
  
Let me take you to a place like no where else  
Show you the things you never felt  
Oh oh let me love you  
  
Let me love you  
Let me love you!  
  
Show you what its like to lose control  
Free the desire in your soul  
Oh oh let me love you  
  
Let me take you to a place like no where else  
Show you the things you never felt  
Oh oh let me love you  
  
Oh I love you  
  
Show you what its like to lose control  
Free the desire in your soul  
Oh oh let me love you  
  
Yeah baby  
  
Let me take you to a place like no where else  
Show you the things you never felt  
Oh oh let me love you  
  
Let me love you  
Let me love you  
Let me love you  
Let me love you

He said  
"I was in my early forties  
With a lot of life before me  
And a moment came that stopped me on a dime  
I spent most of the next days  
Looking at the x-rays  
Talkin' 'bout the options  
And talkin' 'bout sweet time"  
I asked him  
"When it sank in  
That this might really be the real end  
How's it hit you  
When you get that kind of news?  
Man, what'd you do?"  
  
He said  
"I went skydiving  
I went Rocky Mountain climbing  
I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named Fumanchu  
And I loved deeper  
And I spoke sweeter  
And I gave forgiveness I'd been denying"  
And he said  
"Someday I hope you get the chance  
To live like you were dying"  
  
He said  
"I was finally the husband  
That most of the time I wasn't  
And I became a friend a friend would like to have  
And all of a sudden going fishin'  
Wasn't such an imposition  
And I went three times that year I lost my dad  
I finally read the Good Book, and I  
Took a good, long, hard look  
At what I'd do if I could do it all again  
And then  
  
I went skydiving  
I went Rocky Mountain climbing  
I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named Fumanchu  
And I loved deeper  
And I spoke sweeter  
And I gave forgiveness I'd been denying"  
And he said  
"Someday I hope you get the chance  
To live like you were dying  
Like tomorrow was a gift  
And you've got eternity  
To think about  
What you'd do with it  
What could you do with it  
What did I do with it?  
What would I do with it?  
  
Skydiving  
I went Rocky mountain climbing  
I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named Fumanchu  
And I loved deeper  
And I spoke sweeter  
And I watched an eagle as it was flying"  
And he said  
"Someday I hope you get the chance  
To live like you were dying  
To live like you were dying  
To live like you were dying"

That girl, she's a party, all nighter  
Little 'Funky Cold Medina  
Little 'Strawberry Winer  
That girl, she's a love gone stringer  
Me a year old bum country singer  
That girl, she's the walk on the wild side  
She's the day glory snow ride  
Low ride, good time  
  
If you see her tell her I'm lookin' for  
That girl, that girl, that girl  
Hard to find, I'll be spending every night  
Lookin' for that girl, that girl, that girl  
  
Sun down, heaven town  
Drivin' 'round, hittin' the bars

Lookin' for that girl, that girl, that girl  
Driving me crazy  
Something says, baby, yeah  
Baby, you're that girl, that girl, that girl, that girl  
  
That girl she's a sugar-sweet drive by  
Hold my dreams in her blue jeans oh my  
Yellow hammer south Georgia  
Mississippi chick  
Drink cherry wine  
Louisiana lipstick  
  
That girl likes to drink it up real loud  
Blowing smoke in a back broke rebel cloud  
Drop it down summer heat  
I gotta seat up high, silver rebel seat  
  
Waiting for that girl, that girl, that girl  
Hard to find  
Got me spending every night  
Lookin' for that girl, that girl, that girl  
  
Somewhere in heaven's town  
Driving wild, hitting the bars  
Shooting the stars  
Rollin' up on every party  
Wonder where you are  
Lookin' for that girl, that girl, that girl  
Driving me crazy  
Something says, baby, yeah  
Baby, you're that girl  
  
Hair like a field of corn  
Body like a honey comb  
Smile like a country song  
Baby, where you've been?  
That girl, that girl, that girl  
That girl, that girl, that girl  
  
Looking for that girl, that girl, that girl  
Hard to find

Driving me crazy  
Something says, baby, yeah  
Baby, you're that girl, that girl, that girl, that girl  
Yeah, maybe you're that girl, that girl, that girl, that girl  
  
I've been waiting for that girl  
  
Hair like a field of corn  
Body like a honey comb  
Smile like a country song  
Baby, climb on in

He was thinking back when he was a kid  
His folks were divorced  
His old man high on something  
Came knocking at the door  
His mama wouldn't talk to him  
She said boy dontcha let him in  
  
She was cussing and pacing and wasting her life  
On that linoleum floor  
He took him back to his old apartment  
Turned off the TV  
His beautiful broken hero on the couch  
Passed out asleep  
And he put 'em to bed  
With tears in his eyes  
He said dad I love you, goodbye  
  
He headed out into the night  
Seventeen years old  
Fired up that rusty old pickup  
Turned his collar to the cold  
And he headed back to mama's place  
Ready for his big escape  
And he tiptoed up the stairs and left a note  
In the cover's fold  
  
It said mom I wish I could wave a wand  
And make you smile again  
Bring back the man who stole your heart  
'Fore the demons got to him  
If I stay here any longer  
Something sacred's gonna die  
He said mom I love you, goodbye  
  
Took a lot of wrong turns on the road  
Finding his life  
By the grace of God he ended up  
With a little boy and a wife  
And the phone call came from his sister  
It was that old familiar pain  
His mother was at the doorstep  
Of heaven's pure white light  
  
At the end of the service  
His father came up to him  
Clear eyed and sober now he said  
Boy Jesus took my sins  
And I pray someday maybe you'll forgive me too  
With tears in his eyes  
He said son I love you, goodbye  
  
His plane touched down in Texas  
He pulled out his phone  
Dialed in the number, got the machine  
Of his old man's home  
He said dad we got an extra room  
And your grandson has your eyes  
Couldn't say anything else  
Cause he started to cry  
And he choked out dad I love you, goodbye  
  
Dad I love you, goodbye

Mary was the first of three  
Long black hair and sugar sweet  
Daddy's eyes and Momma's crooked smile  
  
She was barely seventeen  
Got a job keepin' dishes clean  
Planned to stay in this city for a while  
For a while  
  
Joseph ran a lumber yard  
About a mile from Olive park  
Quiet boy, he never had much to say  
  
It was love right from the start  
He bought a ring and won Mary's heart  
Had hopes for a home and kids someday  
Kids someday  
  
The angel scared her half to death  
She would've screamed but she lost her breath  
On a midnight there in the middle of May  
  
He said "Oh Mary, don't be afraid  
You'll bear a son that the Lord has made  
Name him Jesus, He'll light the way"  
  
She packed the clothes, he made the plans  
They had to go to Bethlehem  
But there was nowhere left to stay  
  
So in a barn she gave birth  
To the King of Kings, the Lord of Earth  
Just a little bitty thing sleeping on the hay  
Sleeping on the hay  
  
The story's too long to tell  
But He walked on water and lived through hell  
Killed on a cross and rose from the grave  
  
We got a King, they got a Son  
Mary and Joseph were the only ones  
There on that very first Christmas day  
There on that very first Christmas day

I got an empty feelin' when that moving van pulled up  
It got a little emptier as I walked them fill that truck  
And when they carried out your clothes  
It took my breath away  
Now they're headed for that bed  
The thought keeps running though my head  
  
Baby, maybe, we should just sleep on it tonight  
And give our hearts just one more chance to change our minds  
I could be wrong but goodbye just don't feel right  
So baby, maybe, we should just sleep on it tonight  
  
I'll pay them boys to stop right now  
And leave that truck out by the curb  
The TV and the phones packed up, so we won't be disturbed  
There's not a light left in this room, just a shadow of a doubt  
So let's make sure we don't give up  
Before we've thought this through enough  
  
Baby, maybe, we should just sleep on it tonight  
And give our hearts just one more chance to change our minds  
I could be wrong but goodbye just don't feel right  
So baby, maybe, we should just sleep on it tonight

Running round in this new truck  
Bank let's me borrow from month to month  
Running out of credit and find a little cash on the radio  
  
Standing still they're blowing past  
Numbers on cars going Nascar fast  
What I wouldn't give for a slow down, don't you know  
'Cause where I come from, only the horses run  
When the day is done, we take it easy  
  
Meanwhile back at Mama's  
The porch lights on, come on in if you wanna  
Suppers on the stove, and beer's in the fridge  
Red sun sinking out low on the ridge  
Games on the tube and daddy smoked cigarettes  
Whiskey keeps his whistle wet  
Funny the things you thought you'd never miss  
In a world gone crazy as this  
  
Well I found a girl and we don't fit in here  
Talk about how hard it is to breathe here  
Even with the windows down, can't catch a southern breeze here  
One of these days gonna pack it up and leave here  
  
'Cause meanwhile back at Mama's  
The porch lights on, come on in if you wanna  
Suppers on the stove, and beer's in the fridge  
Red sun sinking out low on the ridge  
Games on the tube and daddy smoked cigarettes  
Whiskey keeps his whistle wet  
Funny the things you thought you'd never miss  
In a world gone crazy as this  
  
Oh I miss yeah a little dirt on the road  
I miss corn growing in a row  
I miss being somebody everybody knows there  
Everybody knows everybody  
I miss those small town roots  
Walking around in muddy boots  
The sound of rain on an old tin roof  
It's time we head on back  
  
'Cause meanwhile back at Mama's  
The for sale signs going up and I'm gonna  
Dump this truck and the little I've got  
On a loan to own and a 3 acre lot  
Put supper on the stove and beer in the fridge  
Going for broke, yeah we're gonna be rich  
Watch the sun settin' on the ridge  
Baby tell me whatcha think about this,  
  
Me and you back at Mama's  
Yeah, me and you back at Mama's

I'm sittin' here stoned, at Tortilla Jo's  
Nobody knows my name and that's alright with me.  
She said adios, so I said hello  
Don Julio, top shelf, self help remedy  
  
Sure was good to know you  
I still wanna hold ya,  
But I know it's over.

But the sun still shines on a fool like me.  
  
You pulled the plug, on what I thought was love  
But I got just enough juice to forget about you and squeeze this lime.  
I can see the ocean (I can see the ocean)  
I can feel the breeze (I can feel the breeze)  
Almost can't remember how you left me, down here on my knees  
  
Sure was good to know you  
I still wanna hold ya,  
But I know it's over.  
You ain't coming back.

Aw milk cow blues yeah

Ah Tim, c'mon tell 'em now!  
  
I woke up this mornin'  
Looked out my door  
I can tell my milk cow  
I can tell by the way she lows  
If you see my milk cow  
Please drive her on home  
'Cause I ain't had no milk and butter  
Since my milk cow's been gone  
  
Well you gotta treat me right woman  
Day by day  
Get out your little prayer book  
Get down on your knees and pray  
You're gonna need, you're gonna need  
My help one of these days  
You're gonna be sorry  
You treated me this way  
  
I said well good evening  
Don't that sun look good going down  
I said well good evening  
Don't that sun look good going down  
And don't my home look lonesome  
When my lover ain't around  
  
Low  
You know what low means  
  
Sail on, sail on, sail on little girl, sail on  
Sail on, sail on, sail on little girl, sail on  
You're gonna keep right on sailing  
Till you lose your happy home  
  
Well I tried everything baby  
To get along with you  
Now tell me brother Tim

You can count the days I'm gone  
You're gonna need me, baby  
You're gonna need my love someday  
You're gonna be sorry  
You treated me this way  
Ah milk cow blues  
Ah milk cow  
Come on home

There's a girl  
From back roads Tennessee  
And she works in the factory  
All day on the line  
Then she clocks at five finally  
And there's a bar  
The boys treat her like a queen  
She's the bell of the ball in blue jeans  
And they all get a turn  
Just to turn her around the floor  
And they always want more  
  
She says take me for one more song  
Mr. Whoever You Are  
Spin me around and pull me in close  
And the band slows down  
Then let's get the hell out of this bar  
Mr. Whoever You Are  
Mr. Whoever You Are  
  
They dance  
Melt to the heat of the song  
Their bodies feel like they belong  
And the boys hold on tight  
Thinking I might get lucky tonight  
And they're probably right  
Yeah they're probably right  
  
She says take me for one more song  
Mr. Whoever You Are  
Spin me around and pull me in close  
And the band slows down  
Then let's get the hell out of this bar  
Mr. Whoever You Are  
Mr. Whoever You Are  
  
They hold onto her waist  
She falls into the night  
And she throws back her head  
She looks up toward the sky  
And she laughs  
At all the pretty lights  
  
And says take me for one more song  
Mr. Whoever You Are  
Spin me around and pull me in close  
And the band slows down  
Let's get the hell out of this bar  
Mr. Whoever You Are  
Mr. Whoever You Are  
  
Aw Mr. Whoever You Are  
Mr. Whoever You Are

I never had no one that I could count on  
I've been let down so many times  
I was tired of hurtin' so tired of searchin'  
Til you walked into my life  
It was a feelin' I'd never known  
And for the first time I didn't feel alone  
  
You're more than a lover  
There could never be another  
To make me feel the way you do  
Oh we just get closer  
I fall in love all over  
Every time I look at you  
I don't know where I'd be  
Without you here with me  
Life with you makes perfect sense  
You're my best friend  
You're my best friend  
  
You stand by me you believe in me  
Like nobody ever has  
When my world goes crazy  
You're right there to save me  
You make me see how much I have  
And I still tremble when we touch  
And oh the look in your eyes  
When we make love  
  
You're more than a lover  
There could never be another  
To make me feel the way you do  
Oh we just get closer  
I fall in love all over  
Every time I look at you  
And I don't know where I'd be  
Without you here with me  
Life with you makes perfect sense  
You're my best friend  
You're my best friend  
  
You're more than a lover  
There could never be another  
To make me feel the way you do  
And oh we just get closer  
I fall in love all over  
Every time I look at you  
And I don't know where I'd be  
Without you here with me  
Life with you makes perfect sense  
You're my best friend  
You're my best friend  
You're my best friend

It'd be just another river town  
Streets would have a different sound  
There'd be no honky tonks with whiskey rounds  
No dreamers chasin' dreams down  
  
No tourists takin' in the sights  
No stetsons under broadway lights  
No pickers playin' for pocket change  
No rhinestone boots on an old church stage  
  
Hey blue eyes, cryin' in the rain  
Hey fire, burnin' round the ring  
Hey crazy, you know it's true  
That nashville, wouldn't be nashville, without you  
  
No ghost of the man in black  
No long white cadillac  
No woman standin' by her man  
In the place where it all began  
  
Hey good lookin', hey momma tried  
Hey gambler, hey country boy can survive  
Hey jolene, you know it's true  
That nashville, wouldn't be nashville, without you  
  
Hey georgia, hey smokey mountain rain  
Hey galveston, he stopped loving her today  
Hey fancy, you know it's true  
That nashville, wouldn't have  
Blue eyes, cryin' in the rain  
Hey fire, burnin' round the ring  
Hey crazy, you know it's true  
That nashville, wouldn't be nashville, without you  
  
It'd be just another river town  
Streets would have a different sound

I was standing at the end of my rainbow  
With no where to go and no pot of gold in sight  
All my wishes were way too much to hope for  
But when I saw you I knew I'd seen the light  
  
And not a moment too soon  
With not a minute to spare  
You touched my heart when I didn't have a prayer  
In my darkest hour  
When my world was filled with gloom  
Your sweet love saved me not a moment too soon  
  
I used to think that love would never find me  
And the one who cares was lost somewhere in time  
But when you found me I knew I'd found forever  
  
And not a moment too soon  
With not a minute to spare  
You touched my heart when I didn't have a prayer  
In my darkest hour  
When my world was filled with gloom  
Your sweet love saved me not a moment too soon  
Your sweet love saved me not a moment too soon  
Not a moment too soon

On a lover's leap with a freeway view  
Sittin' on my hood  
Thinkin' bout you  
Going over in my mind  
Every kiss and every fight  
Yeah the fool on the hill  
Is leading down another night  
  
There were days so hard  
I thought I had to go  
I'd get in my car  
And just follow the road  
But this is my home  
And it's who I am  
And I know I'd stay  
If I could make this old town new again  
  
Color other than blue again  
I'd have something to do again  
Instead of thinking about you again  
But the people I know  
The places I go  
Remind me of you  
Oh, won't somebody come around  
And make this old town new  
  
There were nights so long  
I thought the sun burned out  
And there were girls so wrong  
I don't want to talk about  
I was burning up the night  
Yeah, in an alcohol flame  
Lightin' up my way  
Trying to make this old town new again  
  
Color other than blue again  
I'd have something to do again  
Instead of thinkin' about you again  
But the people I know  
The places I go  
Remind me of you  
Won't somebody come around  
And make this old town new  
  
But the people I know and  
The places I go  
Remind me of you  
  
Love goes wrong but life goes on  
And I know what I gotta do  
I'm just hangin' around  
Tryin' to make this old town new

Used to chase that boy home from school  
We called him freckled faced red headed fool  
He was different he wasn't cool like me  
Sticks and stones didn't break any bones  
Bet we never left well enough alone  
And one day he ran away from home you see  
And I passed him as he walked away  
And in his eyes I heard him say  
"One of these days you're gonna love me  
You'll sit down by yourself and think  
About the times you pushed and shoved me  
And what good friends we might've been  
And then you're gonna sigh a little  
Maybe even cry a little but  
One of these days you're gonna love me"  
  
Patty Sue was a small town beauty  
I took one look at her and had to pull her to me  
Lord knows she should've seen right through me  
When I promised her the world  
But at seventeen, you only want one thing  
I left her standin' there with my high school ring  
Innocent tears in the pourin' rain  
As I walked away  
And I still see her in my dreams  
And to this day she's whispering  
  
"One of these days you're gonna love me  
You'll sit down by yourself and think  
About the time you turned from me  
And what good friends we might've been  
And then you're gonna sigh a little  
Maybe even cry a little but  
One of these days you're gonna love me"  
  
Now everybody stands up  
The congregation sings  
It's a song of sweet forgiveness  
And as the chorus rings  
The wind blows clear my memory  
The pages start to turn  
Then suddenly I'm singin'  
The moment that I learn  
  
One of these days I'm gonna love me  
And feel the joy of sweet release  
One of these days, I'll rise above me  
And at last I'll find some peace  
Then I'm gonna smile a little  
Maybe even laugh a little but  
One of these days I'm gonna love me

She's getting dressed up, putting on that lipstick  
Shimmy shaking, right into them cut-offs baby, oh yeah  
You're getting off work, cashing out that paycheck  
Gotta change that shirt and pick that girl up on her front step  
Here she comes now looking so fine  
You've been waiting on this night for such a long, long time  
  
She slides in and you roll down Main Street,  
You turn right when that red light turns green  
Sun sets now, you're half way to heaven  
She picks a song, you turn it up to eleven  
You say "Do you wanna?" and she says "Hell yeah"  
So you hit the party, all your buddies are jealous  
Someday you'll be looking back on your life  
At the memories, this is gonna be one of those nights  
  
Crowded backyard, everybody's laughing  
Kinda party, next week you'll say I was there when it happened  
Coming up on midnight, bout time to get gone  
And then the DJ starts to play your favorite song  
You slow dance for three minutes or so, and then she whispers baby let's go  
  
And then she slides in and she gives you the green light  
You hold off till you turn on the headlights  
Someday when you're looking back on your life  
At the memories, this is gonna be one of those nights  
Yeah one of those nights  
  
Full moon through a crack in the windshield  
You hold her close and you'll never forget how her heartbeat feels  
No you never will  
'Cause someday when you're looking back on your life  
At the memories, this is gonna be one of those nights  
Yeah one of those nights  
One of those nights  
Yeah one of those nights  
One of those nights, oh  
One of those nights  
This is gonna be, hey  
This is gonna be  
One of those nights  
Oh oh

Here's to the corners yet to turn  
Here's to the bridges yet to burn  
Here's to the whole thing blown apart  
It's open season on my heart  
The days go by like flying bricks  
Leave gaping holes too deep to fix  
I'd just stay home if I were smart  
It's open season on my heart  
  
I can't blame anyone but me  
This reckless fool I've come to be  
My tired excuses just don't fit  
It don't look good from where I sit  
I've tried to change without much luck  
I reached the point where I get stuck  
I hit the streets and the fireworks start  
It's open season on my heart  
  
I can't be something that I'm not  
I can't give what I haven't got  
I don't know where or why or when  
I only know the shape I'm in  
  
So here's to the clown down in the mouth  
Here's to the whole thing going south  
My own true love's turned poison dart  
It's open season on my heart  
  
Here's turning heartaches into art  
It's open season on my heart

'Cause it's all in my head  
I think about it  
Over and over again  
And I can't keep  
Picturing you with him  
And it hurts so bad  
Yeah, cause it's all in my head  
I think about it  
Over and over again  
I replay it  
Over and over again  
And I can't take it  
Yeah,I can't shake it, no  
  
I can't wait to see you  
want to see if you still got that  
Look in your eye  
That one you had for me  
Before we said our goodbyes  
And it's a shame that we  
Gotta spend our time  
Being mad about the same things  
Over and over again  
About the same thing  
Over and over again  
  
Oh but I think she's leaving on  
And she's leaving here  
And I don't know what else to do  
(Can't go on not loving you)  
  
'Cause it's all in my head  
I think about it  
Over and over again  
And I can't keep  
Picturing you with him  
And it hurts so bad  
Yeah, cause it's all in my head  
I think about it  
Over and over again  
I replay it  
Over and over again  
And I can't take it  
I can't shake it, no  
  
I remember the day you left  
I remember the last breath  
You took right in front of me  
When you said that you would leave  
I was too damn stubborn to try to stop you  
Or say anything  
But I see clearly now  
And this choice I made keeps  
Playing in my head  
Over and over again  
It play in my head  
Over and over again  
  
Oh but I think she's leaving on  
And she's leaving here  
And I don't know what else to do  
(Can't go on not loving you)  
  
'Cause it's all in my head  
I think about it  
Over and over again  
And I can't keep  
Picturing you with him  
And it hurts so bad  
Yeah, cause it's all in my head  
I think about it  
Over and over again  
I replay it  
Over and over again  
And I can't take it  
I can't shake it, no  
  
Now that I realize  
That I'm going down  
From all this pain you  
Put me through  
Every time I close my eyes  
I lock it down  
Oh, I can't go on not loving you  
  
Cause it's all in my head  
I think about it  
Over and over again  
And I can't keep  
Picturing you with him  
And it hurts so bad  
Yeah, cause it's all in my head  
I think about it  
Over and over again  
I replay it  
Over and over again  
And I can't take it  
I can't shake it, no  
  
'Cause it's all in my head  
I think about it  
Over and over again  
And I can't keep  
Picturing you with him  
And it hurts so bad  
Yeah, cause it's all in my head  
I think about it  
Over and over again  
I replay it  
Over and over again  
And I can't take it  
I can't shake it, no

All our tears have reached the sea  
Part of you will live in me  
Way down deep inside my heart  
The days keep coming without fail  
New wind is gonna find your sail  
That's where your journey starts  
  
[Chorus]  
You'll find better love  
Strong as it ever was  
Deep as the river runs  
Warm as the morning sun  
Please remember me  
  
Just like the waves down by the shore  
We're gonna keep on comin' back for more  
'Cause we don't ever want to stop  
Out in this brave new world you'll see  
Ov'r the valleys and the peaks  
And I can see you on the top  
  
You'll find better love  
Strong as it ever was  
Deep as the river runs  
Warm as the morning sun  
Please remember me  
  
Remember me when you're out walking  
When snow falls high outside your door  
Late at night when you're not sleeping  
And moonlight falls across your floor  
And I can't hurt you anymore  
  
You'll find better love  
Strong as it ever was  
Deep as the river runs  
Warm as the morning sun  
Please remember me  
  
Please remember me

Girl, you've never known no one like me  
Up there in your high society  
They might tell you I'm no good  
Girl they need to understand  
Just who I am  
  
[Chorus]  
I may be a real bad boy  
But baby I'm a real good man  
  
I may drink too much and play too loud  
Hang out with a rough and rowdy crowd  
That don't mean I don't respect  
My mama and my Uncle Sam  
Yes sir, yes ma'am  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Might have a reckless streak  
At least a country mile wide  
If you're gonna run with me  
It's gonna be a wild ride  
When it comes to lovin' you  
I've got velvet hands  
I'll show you how a real bad boy  
Can be a real good man  
  
I'll take all the good times I can get  
I'm too young for growing up just yet  
Ain't much I can promise you  
Except to do the best I can  
I'll be damned  
  
[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

I was twenty and she was eighteen  
We were just about as wild as we were green  
In the ways of the world  
She'd pick me up in that red rag top  
We were free of the folks and hiding from the cops  
On a summer night  
Running all the red lights  
We'd park way out in a clearing in a grove  
And the night was as hot as a coal-burning stove  
We were cooking with gas  
Knew it had to last  
  
[Chorus]  
In the back of that red rag top  
She said please don't stop  
  
Well the very first time her mother met me  
Her green-eyed girl had been a mother-to-be  
For two weeks  
I was out of job and she was in school  
And life was fast and the world was cruel  
We were young and wild  
We decided not to have the child  
So we did what we did and we tried to forget  
And we swore up and down there would be no regrets  
In the morning light  
But on the way home that night  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We took one more trip around the sun  
But it was all make believe in the end  
And no I can't say where she is today  
I can't remember who I was back then  
  
Well you do what you do and you pay for your sins  
And there's no such thing as what might have been  
That's a waste of time  
Drive you out of your mind  
I was stopped at a red light just yesterday  
Beside a young girl in a cabriolet  
And her eyes were green  
And I was in an old scene  
  
[Chorus]  
I was back in that red rag top  
On the day she stopped loving me  
I was back in that red rag top  
On the day she stopped loving me

Last Monday mornin' you left with no warnin'  
I started goin' insane  
Well I headed South out of Del Rio, Texas  
With a hell of a load on my brain  
I kept on goin' without even knowin'  
How much your love really means  
Now I'm messed up in Mexico  
Livin' on refried dreams  
  
I'm down here in Mexico  
Sick as a dog  
My head is poundin' in this border town fog  
Down to my last dime and comin' apart at the seams  
I'm messed up in Mexico  
Livin' on refried dreams  
  
This picture ain't pretty  
I'm ragged and dirty  
And wonderin' what I'm doin' here  
Shootin' tequila  
Wantin' to kill ya  
And wishin' to God you were near  
  
So full of your memory  
But feelin' so empty  
I've run out of my self-esteem  
Now I'm messed up in Mexico  
Livin' on refried dreams  
  
I'm down here in Mexico  
Sick as a dog  
My head is poundin' in this border town fog  
Down to my last dime and comin' apart at the seams  
I'm messed up in Mexico  
Livin' on refried dreams  
  
I'm down here in Mexico  
Sick as a dog  
My head is poundin' in this border town fog  
Down to my last dime and comin' apart at the seams  
I'm messed up in Mexico  
Livin' on refried dreams  
  
Oh, I'm messed up in Mexico  
Livin' on refried dreams

Baby, I go too fast too far  
Let's get it straight now  
The way things are  
I'm not the white knight in your fantasy  
But I could be your wildest dream  
  
[Chorus]  
I might ride with the wind  
I might follow the sun  
I gotta go where I've never been  
'Cause my heart beats to a different drum  
It's just the way I was made  
I'm a renegade  
I'm a renegade  
  
I get this feelin' that I should be gone  
Somethin' keeps tellin' me to take you along  
I got a Chevy with a big back seat  
Climb on in  
And take a chance on me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Don't even think about settlin' down  
I ain't gonna hang my hat in no hometown  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm a renegade  
I'm a renegade

Sometimes this road, it just keeps winding  
Round and round and back again  
But you've always kept me smiling  
Over every hill, round every bend  
Baby you're the one smiling with me when the sun comes up  
I got the wheel, you got the map and that's enough  
  
And we go rolling down this highway  
Chasing all our crazy dreams  
I've gone your way and you've gone my way  
And everywhere in between  
One of these days we'll find a piece of ground  
Just outside of some sleepy little town  
And set this circus down  
  
Sometimes I lie awake just thinking  
Of all the horizons we have seen  
And as another day is sinking  
I thank God you're here with me  
'Cause baby you're the one laughing with me when the sun goes down  
Living on faith and holding on tight to the love we found  
  
And we go rolling down this highway  
Chasing all our crazy dreams  
I've gone your way and you've gone my way  
And everywhere in between  
One of these days we'll find a piece of ground  
Just outside of some sleepy little town  
And set this circus down  
  
And set this circus down  
  
Maybe one of these days, gonna set this circus down  
Set this circus down

Back seat of her daddy's car  
I was tryin' not to go too far  
Kept thinkin' 'bout the words the preacher man said  
Lightning flashed across the sky  
I saw love in a young girl's eyes  
And that's a look you never forget  
  
Seventeen  
Only comes once in a lifetime  
Don't it just fly by wild and free  
Goin' anyway the wind blew baby  
Seventeen  
Livin' on crazy dreams  
Rock and roll and faded blue jeans  
And standin' on the edge of everything  
Seventeen  
  
Legs hangin' off the bayou bridge  
Feedin' fish potato chips  
And talkin' 'bout the mysteries of the universe  
Yeah the world was somewhere else  
We had the summer all to ourselves  
And the stars went off like fireworks  
  
Seventeen  
Only comes once in a lifetime  
Don't it just fly by wild and free  
Goin' anyway the wind blew baby  
Seventeen  
Livin' on crazy dreams  
Rock and roll and faded blue jeans  
And standin' on the edge of everything  
Seventeen  
  
Seventeen  
Only comes once in a lifetime  
Well don't it just fly by wild and free  
Goin' anyway the wind blew baby  
Seventeen  
Livin' on crazy dreams  
Rock and roll and faded blue jeans  
And standin' on the edge of everything  
Seventeen  
Yeah seventeen  
Sweet seventeen

Everywhere I go  
They're staring at her  
Every man I know  
He wants to have her  
I guess I ought to be a jealous man  
I'd look the other way  
They're hittin' on her  
Every night and day they telephone her  
They try to get to her but I know they can't  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause she never lets it go to her heart  
She never lets it go that far  
When they start talking  
She starts walking  
Right back to my arms  
She can turn every head  
But she never lets it go to her heart  
  
She walks into the room  
And everybody watches every move  
Hoping she don't love me  
I know it by the way they hang around  
But they don't realize  
There's more to her than what meets the eye  
That's why I'm certain  
No matter what they do to reach her now  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When they start talking  
She starts walking  
Right back to my arms  
She can turn every head  
But she never lets it go (never lets it go)  
To her heart

Once upon a lonely time  
She swore she'd never let you down  
You held her tight without a care in mind  
While she did her runnin' 'round  
At first you wouldn't face the truth  
You loved her too much to let go  
And though the story had to end  
You want to be her fool again  
Friend there's somethin' you should know  
  
She'll have you back  
Back to drinkin' in no time  
Back to walkin' on your knees  
Boy open up your eyes and see the light  
Some things just aren't meant to be  
I understand how she can get to you  
'Cause she's made more than one man blind  
So try and face the cold hard fact  
She would gladly have you back  
Back to drinkin' in no time  
  
It just don't make no sense to me  
To play a game you'll never win  
You ask me here for my advice  
You say she wouldn't break you twice  
Friend you better think again  
  
She'll have you back  
Back to drinkin' in no time  
Back to walkin' on your knees  
Boy open up your eyes and see the light  
Some things just aren't meant to be  
I understand how she can get to you  
'Cause she's made more than one man blind  
So try and face the cold hard fact  
She would gladly have you back  
Back to drinkin' in no time  
  
So try and face the cold hard fact  
She would gladly have you back  
Back to drinkin' in no time

She's my kind of rain  
Like love in a drunken sky  
She's confetti falling down all night  
She sits quietly there  
Black water in a jar Says baby why you trembling like you are  
  
So I wait  
And I try  
I confess like a child  
  
[Chorus:]  
She's my kind of rain  
Like love from a drunken sky  
Confetti falling down all night  
She's my kind of rain  
  
She's the sunset's shadow  
She's like Rembrandt's light  
She's the history that's made at night  
She's my lost companion  
She's my dreamin' tree  
Together in this brief eternity  
  
Summer days  
Winter snow  
She's all things to behold  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So I wait  
And I try  
I confess all my crimes  
  
[Chorus: Repeat 2X]  
  
She's my kind of rain  
Ohhhhh rain on me  
She's my kind of rain

I fell by the wayside  
I fell on my knees  
Cryin' "why was I so hard to please"  
I stood at the crossroads  
Took a long look at me  
Sometimes you don't know where  
You're from 'til you leave  
  
[Chorus]  
And I've been out there searching  
For a place where I belong  
And on my way I heard my song  
Let it sing me home  
  
The sun on my shoulders  
And the wind at my back  
I'm bound and determined  
To get back on track  
  
To where the heart is  
Where it's been all along  
Sometimes you don't know what you've  
Got 'til it's gone  
Gone, gone, gone  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (3x)  
  
[Chorus]

After all this time, I still miss you everyday  
The same world spins around  
I guess some things never change  
  
Sometimes I go out, but it never feels the same  
I still look for you  
Baby some things never change  
  
When I said I'd love you for eternity  
I just never knew how true those words would be  
  
Just an old love song, just the mention of your name  
My heart breaks in two again  
I guess some things never change  
  
Maybe someday, someone else will set me free  
Until then, I'll live with your love's legacy  
  
And I'll keep holding on  
Hoping you'll come back someday  
You can rest assured baby, some things never change  
  
Girl, I'm still in love with you, I guess  
Some things never change  

She left Oklahoma for California  
Sunglasses on the brim of her hat  
Smoke was pourin' from that old Cadillac  
But she wasn't turnin' back  
Just outside of Blackstaff  
Motor blew on her Coupe Deville  
Just in time she saw a sign  
There was a Texaco waitin' at the bottom of the hill  
  
And she said "somebody must be prayin' for me  
Somebody out there must be prayin' for me  
Must be angels I can't see  
Somebody must be prayin' for me" yeah  
  
A boy 'bout twenty climbed out of a truck  
All covered in grease and dirt  
She said "Hey Charles" but he just laughed  
And said "I'm wearin' my daddy's shirt"  
He stood there lost in her eyes  
And she got lost in his  
As the years roll by she would sigh  
Every time they kiss  
  
And she'd say "somebody must be prayin' for me  
Somebody out there must be prayin' for me  
Must be angels I can't see  
Somebody must be prayin' for me"  
  
Sometimes she stares out the window  
And wonders about her Hollywood dreams  
But when she tucks her kids in bed  
She softly whispers as they fall asleep  
  
Somebody must be prayin' for me  
Somebody out there must be prayin' for me  
Ain't it funny how you always find  
Just what you need  
Somebody must be prayin' for me  
Somebody must be prayin' for me  
Prayin' for me yeah

It was Labor Day weekend I was seventeen  
I bought a Coke and some gasoline  
And I drove out to the County Fair  
And when I saw her for the first time  
She was standing there in the ticket line  
And it all started right then and there  
Oh a sailor's sky made a perfect sunset  
And that's a day I'll never forget  
  
I had a barbecue stain on my white t-shirt  
She was killing me in that mini-skirt  
Skippin' rocks on the river by the railroad tracks  
She had a sun tan line and red lipstick  
I worked so hard for that first kiss  
A heart don't forget something like that  
  
It was five years later on a south-bound plane  
I was headed down to New Orleans  
To meet some friends of mine for the Mardi Gras  
When I heard a voice from the past  
Coming from a few rows back  
When I looked I couldn't believe just what I saw  
  
She said I bet you don't remember me  
And I said only every other memory  
  
I had a barbecue stain on my white t-shirt  
You were killing me in that mini-skirt  
Skippin' rocks on the river by the railroad tracks  
  
You had a sun tan line and red lipstick  
I worked so hard for that first kiss  
A heart don't forget something like that  
  
Like an old photograph  
Time can make a feeling fade  
But the memory of the first love  
Never fades away  
  
I had a barbecue stain on my white t-shirt  
She was killing me in that mini-skirt  
Skippin' rocks on the river by the railroad tracks  
  
She had a sun tan line and red lipstick  
I worked so hard for that first kiss  
A heart don't forget, no a heart don't forget  
I said a heart don't forget something like that  
Oh, not something like that

Think something's broken then again nothin's smokin'  
Or shakin' or chokin' like my ol' truck  
But I think something's broken  
And I think it's worth notin'  
It started about the time  
She got all packed up  
  
Could be my ego, could be my pride  
Or maybe my clam cool collective side  
Might be my heart comin' eye to eye  
With the truth that she wasn't jokin'  
  
Think something's broken  
'Cause I'm just layin' round hopin'  
That maybe any moment  
I'll get on track  
But I think something's broken  
All locked up or frozen cause I can't go forward  
And I sure can't go back  
  
Could be my ego, could be my pride  
Or maybe my clam cool collective side  
Might be my heart comin' eye to eye  
With the truth that she wasn't jokin'  
  
Think it's my heart  
Comin' eye to eye  
With the truth  
She wasn't jokin'  
  
I know something's broken  
I Just started smokin'  
And shakin'and chokin'  
Like my old truck

Now I ain't sayin' them LA ladies don't know what they're doin'  
And I been in love with New York City a time or two  
I had some Seattle coffee, some Chicago wind  
Some Kansas wheat fields I'd love to see again  
But the fireflies play where the cattails grow  
And them southern girls, they talk nice and slow with  
  
Kisses sweeter than Tupelo honey  
Little bit crazy like New Orleans  
Memphis blue and Daytona sunny  
Soft as cotton in some cut-off jeans  
Don't you know,  
Ain't nothing in the whole wide world  
Like a southern girl  
  
(Southern girl rock my world)  
(Hazel eyes and golden curls)  
(Put on a country song)  
(Will dance all night long)  
  
A southern girl's mama probably taught her how a lady should act  
But a southern girl's probably got a barn somewhere reared out back  
She'll get a little hay in her hair, her thighs in the mud  
She's been caught in the rain, and washed in the blood  
Likes jiggers in her coke, takes a little sip,  
Comes over to me with them sunburned lips and them  
  
Kisses sweeter than Tupelo honey  
Little bit crazy like New Orleans  
Memphis blue and Daytona sunny  
Soft as cotton in some cut-off jeans  
Don't you know,  
Ain't nothing in the whole wide world  
Like a southern girl  
  
(Southern girl rock my world)  
(Hazel eyes and golden curls)  
(Put on a country song)  
(Will dance all night long)  
  
If you've ever seen savannah heat up when the stars come out  
Well then fellows come on, you know what I'm talkin' about  
  
Kisses sweeter than Tupelo honey  
Little bit crazy like New Orleans  
Memphis blue and Daytona sunny  
Soft as cotton in some cut-off jeans  
Don't you know,  
Ain't nothing in the whole wide world  
Like a southern girl  
  
(Southern girl rock my world)  
(Put on a country song)  
  
(Southern girl rock my world)  
(Hazel eyes and golden curls)  
(Will dance all night long)  
  
(Southern girl rock my world)  
(Hazel eyes and golden curls)  
(Put on a country song)  
(Will dance all night long)  
  
(Southern girl rock my world)  
(Hazel eyes and golden curls)  
(Put on a country song)  
(Will dance all night long)  
  
(Southern girl rock my world)  
(Hazel eyes and golden curls)  
(Put on a country song)  
(Will dance all night long)

Hank Williams sang it  
Number three drove it  
Chuck Berry twanged it  
Will Farmer wrote it  
Aretha Franklin sold it  
Dolly Parton graced it  
Rosa Parks rode it  
Scarlett O chased it  
  
Smooth as the hickory wind  
That blows from Memphis  
Down the Apalachicola  
It's "Hi y'all, did ya eat?  
Well, come on in  
I'm sure glad to know ya."  
Don't let this old gold cross  
And this Allman Brothers t-shirt throw ya  
It's cicadas making noise  
With the southern voice  
  
Hank Aaron smacked it  
Michael Jordan dunked it  
Pocahontas tracked it  
Jack Daniels drunk it  
Tom Petty rocked it  
Dr. King paved it  
Bear Bryant won it  
Billy Graham saved it  
  
Smooth as the hickory wind  
That blows from Memphis  
Down the Apalachicola  
It's "Hi y'all, did ya eat?  
Well, come on in  
I'm sure glad to know ya."  
Don't let this old gold cross  
And this Crimson Tide t-shirt throw ya.  
It's cicadas making noise  
With the southern voice  
  
Jesus is my friend  
America is my home  
Sweet iced tea and Jerry Lee  
Daytona Beach  
That's what gets to me  
I can feel it in my bones  
  
Smooth as the hickory wind  
That blows from Memphis  
Down the Apalachicola  
It's "Hi y'all, did ya eat?  
Well, come on in child  
I'm sure glad to know ya."  
Don't let this old gold cross  
And this Charlie Daniels t-shirt throw ya.  
We're just boys making noise  
With the southern voice  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Southern voice  
I got a southern voice  
A southern voice

My Body burns  
Like there's a desert deep in me  
A thirsty soul so unsatisfied  
But there you are like a river to the sea  
The one chance I have to change my life  
  
Darlin', take my away from here  
Make it seem like we're a million miles away  
Another time another place  
Make me a different man  
Move me farther than I've ever been before  
Show me that there's something more  
  
Sometimes I feel like I'm trapped inside myself  
Spinning wheels up and down, 'round and 'round  
Going no where just like everybody else  
With no touch, no sight, no sound  
  
But you could take me away from here  
Make it seem like we're a million miles away  
Another time another place  
Make me a different man  
Move me farther than I've ever been before  
Show me that there's something more  
Give me hopes and dreams to fill my head  
Push my heart so I can fly again  
  
Take me away from here  
Make it seem like we're a million miles away  
Another time another place  
Make me a different man  
Move me farther than I've ever been before  
Show me that there's something more  
  
Take me away from here  
Take me away from here  
Take me away from here  
Take me away from here  
Take me away from here

It was rainin' hard in Houston when I ran into her  
I searched for conversation but I was lost for words  
Then a cloud of tear filled memories came crashin' down on me  
If it hadn't been for the pourin' rain I'm sure she would have seen  
  
Tears in the rain  
Hidin' the pain  
Maybe she'd come back  
If she could see me cry  
She thinks I'm so strong  
Oh, but she's so wrong  
She just couldn't see these tears in the rain  
  
Now, I'll regret that moment 'cause I didn't let her know  
How much I still loved her I was hopin' it would show  
But the raindrops and the teardrops ran together on my face  
Now she'll never, ever know no one can take her place  
  
Tears in the rain  
Hidin' the pain  
Maybe she'd come back  
If she could see me cry  
She thinks I'm so strong  
Oh, but she's so wrong  
She just couldn't see these tears in the rain  
  
She thinks I'm so strong  
Oh, but she's so wrong  
She just couldn't see these tears in the rain

When I was nineteen,  
I threw my stuff in the car  
I headed up to the Rockies, got a job at this bar  
Sellin' beer to the locals, just barely gettin' by  
On the tips from the rich kids, their on Daddy's dime  
But when I saw her walk in one night  
I knew that I'd be alright in...  
  
[Chorus]  
Telluride  
The snow fallin' down  
I was wakin' up with her in that sleepy little town  
In her eyes my world came so alive  
  
I never will forget the moment she arrived in Telluride  
  
We spent that whole winter tangled up by a fire  
Castin' shadows on the cabin wall, drownin' in desire  
Confessin' all our secrets and laughin' out loud  
So high up on that mountain  
I thought we'd never come down  
It was a dream we were livin' in  
And I was the happiest I'd ever been, in....  
  
[Chorus]  
I will never forget all those sleepless nights in Telleride  
  
It ended just like a movie scene  
And I had to play the part  
Of the lover who stood there and watched her leave  
And me with the frozen heart, in....  
  
[Chorus]  
I never will forget the day she said good bye, in Telluride  
  
[Chorus]  
I will never forget all those sleepless nights in Telluride  
  
Telluride [Repeat until fade]

Well I was southern born and raised on the Good Book  
My old boots are worn from the hard roads I took  
And I'm proud to be my daddy's son  
And momma taught me how to work and not to quit  
Until the job's done  
Well I may not be high society but I got all I need  
And that's just me  
The only way I know to be  
That's just me  
What you get is what you see  
  
Well they tell me I'm old fashioned  
And that I'm part of a dying breed  
I'd say I'm living in real good company  
But that's just me  
  
Well I got me a wife and we're bringing up a young one  
Well she's a backwoods woman and my boy he's a top gun  
We live out in the country where we're free to roam  
And when a hard day is over how I love just going home  
Well it's the life I live and the air I breathe  
  
The way I believe  
  
And that's just me  
The only way I know to be  
That's just me  
What you get is what you see  
  
Well they tell me I'm old fashioned  
And that I'm part of a dying breed  
I'd say I'm living in real good company  
But that's just me  
  
Yeah they tell me I'm old fashioned  
And that I'm part of a dying breed  
I'd say I'm living in real good company  
But that's just me

You got your head in your supper  
And the eyes of your mother, baby  
Locked on you  
Everybody wants a piece of you, oh yeah  
And your phone keeps ringing  
Cause your cousin's singing at the local bar  
Everybody wants to be a star  
Just like you are  
  
You kept your face in the gutter for years  
Kept your eyes on the road  
You always felt you were meant for me  
Baby now you know  
  
Everybody wants a glimpse of the one that got away  
Everybody wants to see you  
And everybody wants to be you too  
It's funny how they put you down  
But now they think you're alright  
And everybody loves you now that  
You're the one that got away (the one that got away)  
  
See you were raised in the town  
Where the kids hang around the pizza hut parking lot  
Everybody talks a lot, no one likes to do, no  
And all the cub scout leaders at the local theaters  
Said you couldn't sing a song that well  
You told 'em all to go to hell  
And went out on your own  
  
You got a head shot picture to  
Sell yourself to the world  
You tucked your scars up under your dress  
Like an American girl  
  
Everybody wants a glimpse of the one that got away  
Everybody wants to see you  
And everybody wants to be you too  
It's funny how they put you down  
But now they think you're alright  
And everybody loves you tonight  
You're the one that got away, yeah  
  
Everybody wants a glimpse of the one that got away  
Everybody wants to see you  
And everybody wants to be you too  
It's funny how they put you down  
But now they think you're alright  
And everybody loves you now that  
You're the one that got away  
  
Everybody wants a glimpse of the one that got away  
Everybody wants to see you  
And everybody wants to be you too  
It's funny how they put you down  
But now they think you're alright  
And everybody loves you now that  
You're the one that got away  
(the one that got away)

Some people say I'm one of those guys with blessings in life overlooked  
Sometimes I feel like the tatter torn pages of some old paperback book  
All the places I've played and the money I've made  
Still I've got nothing to show  
And the only thing that I have left in the whole wide world is you  
You put your whole life into somethin' you love and you never get that one big
break  
Gotta take you out of the back street bars and put you on center stage  
But a million tears and a million beers have just about washed me up  
And the only thing that I have left in the whole wide world is you  
  
I gave it all I had every night for all these years pourin' out my soul  
'Til it was gone  
I spread myself so thin and I'm just barely hangin' on  
But tonight I'm with you and you can carry me through  
Just love me  
'Cause the only thing that I have left in the whole wide world is you  
I gave it all I had every night for all these years  
Pourin' out my soul til it was gone  
I spread myself so thin and I'm just barely hangin' on  
But tonight I'm with you and you can carry me through just love me  
'Cause the only thing that I have left in the whole wide world Is you  
Oh, is you

If I never think about her I'll never miss her at all  
Never wonder what she's doing never give her a call  
Never see her again and I'll be free as a bird  
But the trouble with never is never never works  
  
If I never bring her flowers I'll never see her smile  
If I never try to kiss her she'll never drive me wild  
And I'll never feel the need to say those three little words  
But the trouble with never is never never works  
  
I know how to stay care free  
Let no one get a hold on me  
But I can't keep my hands off her  
There's somethin' different 'bout this girl  
  
If I never let me love her I'll never settle down  
And I'll never put roots in this God forsaken town  
And I'll never say "I do" or step foot in a church  
But the trouble with never is never never works  
  
I know how to stay care free  
Let no one put a hold on me  
But I can't keep my hands off her  
There's somethin' different 'bout this girl  
  
If I never think about her I'll never miss her at all  
Never wonder what she's doing never give her a call  
Never see her again and I'll be free as a bird  
But the trouble with never is never never works  
Yeah the trouble with never is never never works  
At least not with her, oh no

The clock above the bar  
Is telling me it's 12:15  
It's not such a gentle reminder  
That I'm where I shouldn't be  
  
I just keep waiting for something to happen  
Waitin' for somebody to come walkin' in  
Somebody as perfect as you were  
So I can try it again  
  
(But) chances are so hard to come by  
And the second one is impossible to find  
The clock keeps runnin' and the odds keep getting higher  
That it's all just a fantasy of mine  
  
But I shouldn't be thinkin' about it  
I shouldn't be worried about it  
It's just a clock on the wall  
But it's tickin' away  
It's tickin' away  
It's tickin' away  
It's tickin' away  
  
I suppose I should cut all my losses  
Go home with a six-pack of beer  
There ain't nobody in the world like you, baby  
If there was she wouldn't be coming in here  
  
But I shouldn't be thinkin' about it  
I shouldn't be worried about it  
It's just a clock on the wall  
But it's tickin' away  
It's tickin' away  
It's just a clock on the wall but  
It's tickin' away  
It's tickin' away  
It's tickin' away  
It's just a clock on the wall but  
It's tickin' away  
  
I suppose I should cut all my losses  
Go home with a six-pack of beer

Blue jean baby, L.A. lady  
She was the seamstress for the band  
Pretty eyed, pirate smile  
She'll marry a music man  
Ballerina, you must have seen  
Her dancing in the sand  
And now she's in me  
Always with me, tiny dancer in my hand  
  
Jesus freaks out in the street  
Handing tickets out for God  
Turning back she just laughs  
The boulevard is not that bad  
  
Piano man he makes his stand  
In the auditorium  
Looking on she sings the songs  
The words she knows, the tune she hums  
  
But oh how it feels so real  
Lying here with no one near  
Only you and you can hear me  
When I say softly, slowly  
  
[Chorus]  
Hold me closer tiny dancer  
Count the headlights on the highway  
Lay me down in sheets of linen  
You had a busy day today  
  
Blue jean baby, L.A. lady  
Seamstress for the band  
Pretty eyed, pirate smile  
Hear she married a music man  
Ballerina, you must have  
Seen her she was dancing in the sand  
And now she's in me, always  
With me, tiny dancer in my hand  
  
[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

[Verse 1]  
We could have a little double wide planted in an empty field  
We could have a big old white picket wrap around on a hill  
Don't make a difference to me baby, where the wind takes me, long as I'm with
you girl  
We could have something or nothing, still be sitting on top of the world  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause when you got love, like we got love  
I'm holding on to heaven, holding on to you  
When you got one, like I got one  
Anyway you looking, it's a hell of a view  
  
[Post-Chorus]  
Don't know where we're gonna be  
But I know we're gonna be  
Sitting on top of the world  
So keep hanging on to me  
Yeah, don't you wanna be  
Sitting on top of the world  
Top of the world  
  
[Verse 2]  
We could be rolling on a couple of Goodyear's and painted rust  
We could be strolling barefoot in the sand, in the setting sun  
Yeah, any way you kiss me, flips me and gets me the right kind of tipsy, girl  
We could be somewhere or nowhere and still be sitting on top of the world  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause when you got love, like we got love  
I'm holding on to heaven, holding on to you  
When you got one, like I got one  
Anyway you looking, it's a hell of a view  
  
[Post-Chorus]  
Don't know where we're gonna be  
But I know we're gonna be  
Sitting on top of the world  
So keep hanging on to me  
Yeah, don't you wanna be  
Sitting on top of the world  
Top of the world  
  
[Instrumental Bridge]  
Top of the world  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause when you got love, like we got love  
I'm holding on to heaven, holding on to you  
When you got one, like I got one  
Anyway you looking, it's a hell of a view  
Cause when you got love, like we got love  
I'm holding on to heaven, holding on to you  
When you got one, like I got one  
Anyway you looking, it's a hell of a view  
  
[Post-Chorus]  
Don't know where we're gonna be  
But I know we're gonna be  
Sitting on top of the world  
So keep hanging on to me  
Yeah, don't you wanna be  
Sitting on top of the world  
Top of the world  
  
[Outro]  
Cause when you got love, like we got love  
Sitting on top of the world  
Cause when you got love, like we got love  
Sitting on top of the world  
Cause when you got love, like we got love  
Sitting on top of the world  
Cause when you got love, like we got love  
Sitting on top of the world

If I lived and breathed before you loved me, I don't recall  
If I walked around at all, it was in bits and pieces  
Of a jagged heart  
You kissed me and every piece went back in place, every pain got erased  
You held me up to the sunlight, now it feels like  
  
No one ever left me out in the rain  
Cold words still remain unspoken  
And I never got lost, spent years in the dark  
You're here, now my heart's unbroken  
When I see you smile feel my soul again  
And I'm unbroken  
  
If I doubted the power of love, baby now I understand  
I thank God for every day I wake up to the soft touch  
Of your magic hands  
In this world sometimes the only thing that's real is the way you make me feel  
Babe, the changes day and night  
I swear it's life  
  
No one ever left me out in the rain  
Cold words still remain unspoken  
And I never got lost, spent years in the dark  
You're here, now my heart's unbroken  
When I see you smile feel my soul again  
I'm unbroken  
  
I still see the night, I fell into your eyes  
And when we made love it felt like the first time  
  
No one ever left me out in the rain  
Cold words still remain unspoken  
And I never got lost, spent years in the dark  
You're here, now my heart's unbroken  
When I see you smile feel my soul again  
I'm unbroken  
  
I'm unbroken, oh yeah  
I'm unbroken  
  
No one ever left me out in the rain  
Cold words still remain unspoken  
And I never got lost, spent years in the dark  
You're here, now my heart's unbroken  
No one ever left me out in the rain  
Cold words still remain unspoken  
I never got lost, spent years in the dark  
You're here, now my heart's unbroken  
No one ever left me out in the rain

In the fights they had he'd cover up his ears  
Thought big boys don't cry, fight back all the tears  
Mamma'd use her makeup to hide the bruises on her face  
In the morning they'd pretend that there'd never ever been a trace  
His old man woke him up to help him find the car  
Take the bus uptown outside some run down bar  
He swore that he was quitting, and then he'd start to cry  
And though the boy knew the truth, sometimes he'd still believe that lie  
  
The sins of the father are the sins of the son  
All you do is crawl when you want to run  
God gave boys their mammas  
'Cause they always see their promise  
And they help them understand  
How to walk like man  
Walk like a man  
  
They moved a lot of places, they never settled down  
And it got pretty old being the new kid in town  
He'd always tell his friends, "My daddy's sick today"  
Said he's be rich if he had a nickel every time he heard his momma say:  
  
The sins of the father are the sins of the son  
Crawl before you walk boy, walk before you run  
Come on stand up straight, I'm proud of you, take my hand  
I know you can  
Walk like a man  
Walk like a man  
  
Your daddy's demons are callin' your name  
Don't you listen to you 'em cause they got no claim  
Temptations may come that ain't no sin  
You get stronger every time that you don't give in  
  
The sins of the father are the sins of son  
You can't undo what has been done  
You'll have to retrace his footsteps through the sand  
And pray you find the love of a girl  
Take her by the hand and walk on  
Walk like a man

The creek goes ripplin' by  
I been barefootin' all day with my baby  
Brown leaves have started fallin'  
Leadin' the way  
I like it best just like this  
Doin' nothin' all the way  
So let's lay down in the tall grass  
Dreamin' away  
  
[Chorus]  
And all I want to do is let it be  
And be with you and watch the wind blow by  
And all I want to see is you and me  
Go on forever like the clear blue sky  
Slowly, there's only you and I  
And all I want to do is watch the wind blow by  
  
Girl, you know you told me not so long ago  
To let it come, then let it pass  
And all your troubles and your sorrows  
They won't last  
So let me kiss you now little darlin'  
Beneath this autumn moon  
Cold winds, another season  
Will be here soon  
  
[Chorus]  
  
All I want to do is watch the wind blow by  
And all I want to do is watch the wind blow by

You've got a glow that's not a suntan  
And a new gleam in your eyes  
Oh, it must have been one great vacation  
Girl, you look so satisfied  
  
Tell me what room was the holiday in  
Was I out of your mind when you turned to him  
What a good time it must have been  
Tell me what room was the holiday in  
  
You said you needed a small vacation  
Just a couple of days all by yourself  
So, off you went in a new direction  
And what you found was someone else  
  
So, tell me what room was the holiday in  
Was I out of your mind when you turned to him  
What a good time it must have been  
Tell me what room was the holiday in  
  
What room was the holiday in  
Was I out of your mind when you turned to him  
What a good time it must have been  
Tell me what room was the holiday in  
  
Tell me what room was the holiday  
Was I out of your mind when you turned to him  
What a good time it must have been  
Tell me what room was the holiday in

With a trembling pen in hand I try the best I can  
To write all the reasons I can't stay  
And I hope she'll understand I can't leave her like a man  
'Cause a man would never leave her this way  
  
A note of things I should've said  
Lays beside her sleeping head  
As I turn and make my way off in the night  
By the time the morning's breaking  
My heart will still be aching  
Every time I think of what I've left behind  
  
'Cause I don't want to see me leaving in her eyes  
And I can't stand to watch her watch me make her cry  
And I don't know a right way I can do her wrong  
So I don't want to be here in the morning  
When she wakes up and finds me gone  
  
It hurts to know how much she'll hurt I've told myself things could be worse  
And I've convinced myself she's better off this way  
By the time she finds I'm gone  
I'll be a long, long way from home  
When she reads a note of things I couldn't say  
  
'Cause I don't want to see me leaving in her eyes  
And I can't stand to watch her watch me make her cry  
And I don't know a right way I can do her wrong  
So I don't want to be here in the morning  
When she wakes up and finds me gone  
  
Lord I don't want to be here in the morning  
When she wakes up and finds me gone

Six lanes tail lights  
Red ants marchin' into the night  
They disappear to the left and right again  
Another supper  
From a sack  
A ninety nine cent heart attack  
I got a poundin' head and an achin' back  
And the camels buried in a big straw stack  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm gonna live where the green grass grows  
Watch my corn pop up in rows  
Every night be tucked in close, to you  
Raise our kids where the good Lord's blessed  
Point our rockin' chairs towards the west  
And plant our dreams where the peaceful river flows  
Where the green grass grows  
  
Well I'm from  
A map dot  
A stop sign on a blacktop  
I caught the first bus, I could hop from there  
But all o' this glitter is gettin' dark  
There's concrete glowin' in the city park  
I don't know who my neighbors are  
And there's bars on the corner and bars on my heart  
  
I'm gonna live where the green grass grows  
Watch my corn pop up in rows  
Every night be tucked in close, to you  
Raise our kids where the good Lord's blessed  
Point our rockin' chairs towards the west  
And plant our dreams where the peaceful river flows  
Where the green grass grows  
  
I'm gonna live where the green grass grows  
Watch my corn pop up in rows  
Every night be tucked in close, to you  
Raise our kids where the good Lord's blessed  
Point our rockin' chairs towards the west  
And plant our dreams where the peaceful river flows  
Whoa where the green grass grows

Come with me, and let's go wander  
Far beyond the wild blue yonder,  
Out where stars roam free.  
Though the journey's far from breezy,  
Stick with me, I'll make it easy-  
You can depend on me.  
  
Yeah, there's a long road before us,  
And it's a hard road, indeed.  
Bur darlin', I swear,  
I'll get us there,  
Wherever the trail may lead.  
  
Once we cross that far horizon,  
Life is bound to be surprisin'  
But we'll take it day by day.  
Never mind the wind and weather,  
If we walk that trail together,  
Somehow we'll find our way.  
  
Yeah, there's a long road before us,  
And it's a hard road, indeed.  
Bur darlin', I vow,  
We'll get through somehow,  
Wherever the trail may lead.  
  
Can't tell you when we'll be there-  
It may take all our lives.  
We're headin' for that great unknown.  
We'll soon be walkin' free there,  
But 'til that day arrives,  
At least we won't be travellin' alone...  
  
And there's a long road before us,  
And it's a hard road, indeed.  
Bur darlin', don't fear,  
'Cause I'll be right here,  
To give you the strength you need...  
And through the whole ride,  
I'll be by your side,  
Wherever the trail may lead.

Without me  
Maybe you'd find somebody else  
A little wiser  
With a lot more wealth  
And without you  
It's true I'd be free  
To go chasing all my dreams  
Without any strings  
  
But I wouldn't want it any other way  
Having you to come home to at the end of every day  
Your tender touch puts a smile back on my face  
Wouldn't want it any other way  
  
Hard times  
May never let up on us  
And maybe all we'll ever have  
Will barely be enough  
And babe you know  
How cold the wind can blow  
Love's never let us down  
When we needed it the most  
  
And I wouldn't want it any other way  
Having you to come home to at the end of every day  
Your tender touch puts a smile back on my face  
Wouldn't want it any other way  
  
Your tender touch puts a smile back on my face  
Wouldn't want it any other way  
Wouldn't want it any other way  
Any other way  
Oh girl  
You know I love you more each day  
Any other way

She walks over to him and she says  
Do you remember me  
I think we might've met somewhere before  
Southern Carolina is the place that comes to mind  
But hey I guess you never really can be sure  
  
Oh there's nothing like a true love  
To go and make a fool of someone  
Just like before  
And right there for a minute  
I forgot that you don't love me anymore  
  
Then an old familiar feeling  
Wraps its arms around the moment  
And he says so many times I've tried to call  
Well you'd think it's been a lifetime  
It's been two years since I've seen you  
But it seems just like no time's gone by at all  
  
Oh there's nothing like a real love  
To give you back the feel of someone  
Just like before  
And right there for a minute  
I forgot that you don't love me anymore  
  
Oh and how far we'll travel  
For a place to heal our hearts  
We watched it unravel  
To why's tonight the hardest part  
  
Then he says the weather's changin'  
And it's icin' up the highway  
So I guess it's time for me to hit the road  
So she says good-bye and then before  
She knows what she is sayin' she says  
I wish you didn't have to go  
  
Oh there's nothing like a true love  
To go and make a fool of someone  
Just like before  
And right there for a minute  
I forgot that you don't love me anymore  
And right there for a minute  
I forgot that you don't love me anymore

I thought I felt you touch my cheek this mornin'  
But I must'a been dreamin'  
And in the middle of the night with out a warnin'  
I thought I heard you breathin'  
Me and my so-called independence  
I've got this loneliness that's so relentless  
  
[Chorus]  
I guess you get used to somebody  
Kind of like havin' them around  
I guess you get used to the way they make you happy  
Bring you up when you're feelin' down  
I never dreamed when I was letting you go  
That I would wake up and miss you this much  
I guess you get used to somebody  
I guess you get used to bein' loved  
  
I kinda miss those ramblin' conversations  
Where we talked about nothin'  
The way you always made me laugh at my frustrations  
Baby, that was somethin'  
I should've been careful what I wished for  
Cause I've got my freedom and so much more  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I never dreamed when I was letting you go  
That I would wake up and miss you this much  
I guess you get used to somebody  
I guess you get used to bein' loved

Your eyes say that you've been hurt before  
And you can't take the heartache anymore  
You think I'll do what he's done to you  
Break your trust and be untrue  
But baby this is me you're talkin' to  
  
You got the wrong man, it's not me  
A case of mistaken identity  
I didn't break your heart you see  
What can I do to make you understand  
You got the wrong man  
  
I know you think that love will never last  
And you see your future like the past  
You don't want to make the same mistake  
You think that I'm one more to make  
But baby, I'm not him for goodness sake  
  
You got the wrong man, it's not me  
A case of mistaken identity  
I didn't break your heart you see  
What can I do to make you understand  
You got the wrong man  
  
You think I'll do what he's done to you  
Break your trust and be untrue  
But baby this is me you're talkin' to  
  
You got the wrong man, it's not me  
A case of mistaken identity  
I didn't break your heart you see  
What can I do to make you understand  
You got the wrong man

He sat down, picked up the phone  
And said, "Boy, I'm your old man"  
He touched the glass between the two  
As if to shake his hand  
  
The boy, he didn't budge  
Not even so much as a blink  
The man said, "Oh, come on  
Better late than never, don't you think?"  
  
He said, "I read it in the paper  
Can't believe you're 21  
Can't believe some son of mine  
Could do the things I hear you've done"  
  
He went on like some big hero  
Who flew in to save the day  
And the boy said, "If you're here  
To steer me right, man, it's too late"  
  
"You had to be there  
And I'm talkin' from day one  
That's the only time a man should talk  
Through glass to his new son"  
  
"And you'd have to go back  
And teach me how when I was nine  
'Cause my mama couldn't throw a ball  
Even if she had the time"  
  
"And I should have been learnin' how to fish  
Instead of learnin' how to smoke  
I bet if you'd have whooped my tail  
I'd never thought it was a joke"  
  
He said, "Sometimes the will  
For doin' wrong is way too strong  
For any Mama's prayers  
You had to be there"  
  
The man said, "Boy, I'm sorry  
That you hate me like you do"  
The boy said, "Dry it up, man  
We ain't makin' this about you"  
  
"It's about a teenage girl against the world  
Who was left there high and dry  
About a kid who might have stood  
A whole lot better shot at life"  
  
"But you had to be there  
And I'm talkin' from day one  
That's the only time a man should talk  
Through glass to his new son"  
  
"You'd have to go back  
And teach me how when I was nine  
'Cause my mama couldn't throw a ball  
Even if she had the time"  
  
"I should have been learnin' how to fish  
Instead of learnin' how to smoke  
I bet if you'd have whooped my tail  
I'd never thought it was a joke"  
  
He said, "Sometimes the will  
For doing wrong is way too strong  
For any Mama's prayer  
You had to be there"  
  
Before the boy hung up the phone  
He said, "They say I'm out of time"  
And it hit the man right there and then  
"My God, son, so am I"

You just get better all the time  
Darling, don't you change a thing  
Lately you're the only song I want to sing  
You're my reason to try  
  
You just get sweeter every day  
The little things you do and say  
If only you could see you through my eyes  
You just get better all the time  
  
And I get the feeling I can make it babe  
As long as you are by my side  
You're the music in my ears  
The laughter when the tears  
Are falling down in my life  
  
And on down through the years  
You never tried to change my ways  
You never made me feel I had to say  
I'm sorry  
  
You just get better all the time  
And just today I heard you read my mind  
That kind of magic is so hard to find  
You just get better all the time  

Yeah I swore to offer love  
I swore off women  
Devoted my life to huntin' and fishin'  
I'd never be anyone else's lovesick fool  
It ain't cool  
I spend all my spare time  
Fixin' up  
That old rusted up pick up truck  
In no time at all  
I'd have it lookin' like brand new  
Then you...  
  
[Chorus:]  
Flip the switch on my Dumaflachi  
Played my piano like Liberace  
I let down my guard  
And my heart was as good as gone  
So long  
Yeah, ya cranked my tractor  
Ya flick my bic  
Woman you trig my trigger on my thing-a-majig  
Can't explain how ya done it  
But, honey, you turn me on  
  
You done all the takin'  
I done all the gettin'  
I threw up my hands, said  
"The heck with it"  
I shut down my heart  
Locked it up and pulled the fuse  
Before it blew  
All my emotions were disconnected  
No sign of a spark  
The big detector  
I had nobody  
So I had nothing to lose  
Then you...  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah, ya crank my tractor  
Ya flick my bic  
Woman you trig the trigger on my thing-a-majig  
Can explain how you done it  
But, honey, you turn me on  
  
I can't handle that baby  
You better slow down  
Shhwwwooo!
