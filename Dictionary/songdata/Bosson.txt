Baby don't cry over me, save your love  
Baby don't cry over me, don't want you to live like that  
Baby, help yourself stop living in a lie, ahh  
Lady, it's your life 'till the moment that you die, ahh  
I won, i won, i wonder 'bout tender lovin' to me  
They say, they say, to stay away from me  
I know, i know, i know i do the right thing  
[Chorus:]  
Baby don't cry over me, save your love  
Baby don't cry over me, don't want you to live like that  
You're all alone, yeah  
You're all alone, don't want you to live like that  
Baby, just for you i'm givin' it a try, ahh  
Lady, seems to be a definite goodbye, ahh  
2 pe, 2 pe, 2 people out on the unsafe ice  
you see, you see, you seem to keep your lies  
Our me, our me, our memories will delight our life  
You'll be, you'll be forever in my mind...  
[Chorus]  
Don't talk about, forget about  
Don't talk about  
Things go up, and things go down  
Say you won't cry and i'll sing to you now  
Things go up, and things go down  
Say you won't cry and i'll sing to you now  
[Chorus]

I'm holding you tight  
I feel that you're close but yet so far  
Say what's on your mind  
Cause sometimes I wonder where you are  
Wherever you go, whatever you do  
I'll always be there watching out for you  
Just tell me the truth cause  
I think that we both deserve to know...  
  
If you believe in love  
Then let it show  
If you want someone  
Just let them know  
If you believe in love  
Then let it show  
If I'm not the one  
Just let me know...  
  
Oh oh  
Just let me know  
Oh oh  
Just let me know  
  
So open your heart  
Or give me the key that I'm looking for  
I'm falling apart  
So please let me in through that secret door  
Wherever you go, whatever you do  
I'll always be there watching out for you  
Just tell me the truth cause  
I think that we both deserve to know  
  
If you believe in love...  
Then let it show  
If you want someone  
Just let them know  
If you believe in love  
Then let it show  
If I'm not the one  
Just let me know...  
  
Oh oh...  
Just let me know  
Oh oh  
Just let me know  
  
All I want is for you to understand  
This crazy battle going on inside this man  
Don't let our love, just slip right through our hands...  
Oh oh  
  
If you believe in love...  
Then let it show  
If you want someone  
Just let them know  
If you believe in love  
Then let it show  
If I'm not the one  
Just let me know...

Definite goodbye until we say goodbye  
Definite goodbye  
  
Can't be together, we can't be apart  
We tried to get it right with a brand new start  
I really thought we would stick till the end  
But some things are never meant...  
  
Let me stay for a while  
Let me lay down by your side one last time  
Let me cry one more tear  
Let me hold you in my arms until we say goodbye  
Definite goodbye until we say goodbye  
Definite goodbye  
  
Right now I can't see a life without you  
I don't know where I am,  
I don't know where to go  
Our love is too deep, we can not be friends  
So this is where it all ends....  
  
I know tomorrow there's a new day  
That separation is the best way  
But all good moments are worth fighting for  
So hold me just once more...  
  
Let me stay for a while  
Let me lay down by your side one last time  
Let me cry one more tear  
Let me hold you in my arms until we say goodbye  
Definite goodbye until we say goodbye  
Definite goodbye  
  
I give you a kiss for moments like this  
We don't need to speak to know what we're gonna miss  
I'm holding you tight and after a while  
We can't stop our tears from falling..  
  
Let me stay for a while  
Let me cry one more tear  
  
Let me stay for a while  
Let me lay down by your side one last time  
Let me cry one more tear  
Let me hold you in my arms until we say goodbye  
  
Let me stay for a while  
Let me lay down by your side one last time  
Let me cry one more tear  
Let me hold you in my arms until we say goodbye

I know this place is where I am,  
No other place is better then.  
No matter where I go I am,  
Proud to be Canadian!  
  
I am, you know I am, I am Canadian!  
I am, you know I am, I am Canadian!  
Common!  
  
I love this country where I am,  
This land is where I make my stand.  
No other heart is truer then,  
The one we call Canadian!  
  
Sing it!  
  
I am, you know (you know I am), I am Canadian  
I am, you know I am (you know I am), I am Canadian.  
I am canadian!

I don't want to say goodbye  
I don't want to be alone  
I give you one more chance to say how much you want me back  
Oh, I'll give you one more chance to say that this time it will last until  
That death will do us part  
  
So we can find peace in our hearts  
Oh, I give you one more chance to say you're sorry  
And that you love me, cause  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't want to be alone  
I don't want to be apart again  
I don't want to say goodbye, again  
I don't want a broken heart  
I don't want to be hurt again  
I don't want to say goodbye,again  
  
I give you one more chance to prove that you're the one for me  
I give you one more chance but this time you will have to  
Work hard for a man with dignity  
You'll have to earn my trust you see  
I give you one more chance to say you're sorry  
And that you love me  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Do you understand  
All the pain you caused  
When you cheated on me  
Baby  
So swear to god  
And promise me  
That it will never ever  
Happen again  
Cause I still love you  
  
[Chorus: x2]

[Intro:]  
I need love, I want love  
  
The time was not right  
Blinded by magic in my baby's eyes  
All I ever dreamed of  
I saw you in white walking by my side  
  
But I still believe that one day  
Things work out for you and me  
And I still believe we can't be friends  
There's so much more for us to be...  
  
[Chorus:]  
I need love, I need you  
I want love, I want you  
Nothing's been the same since you walked out that door,  
You are everything that I've been looking for  
I need love, I need you  
  
So full of life And so many thing's that you wanted too  
My world was too small for you  
So try your wings the way I used to do  
  
But I still believe that one day  
When your world is cold and mean  
You will fly back home where you belong  
To the luckiest man you've seen...  
  
[Chorus:]  
I need love, I need you  
I want love, I want you  
Nothing's been the same since you walked out that door,  
You are everything that I've been looking for  
I need love, I need you  
  
So when I miss you like crazy  
I just take a walk to our place down by the sea  
To make a wish on a falling star  
And I wish you were here.... With me  
With me  
With me  
With me  
  
[Chorus:]  
I need love, I need you  
I want love, I want you  
Nothing's been the same since you walked out that door,  
You are everything that I've been looking for  
I want love, I want you  
You are the one I want' you are the one I need

Lyrics:bosson, music: bosson  
Chorus:  
Is it love, is it love that I feel  
Is this the love people talk about  
Is it love, is it love that I feel  
Is this the love that we used to dream about  
Is it love...  
I'm standing alone, in a bright cold December night  
I'm counting the stars, while I wait, here for you my lady  
They say we're meant for each other  
That it's too good to be true  
I take a little time to discover  
My body's aching for you  
Chorus  
I'm starting to walk, heading home, is it over now  
Then you're calling my name, I reach out  
Though it hurts so baby  
They say we're meant for each other  
That it's too good to be true  
I take a little time to discover  
My body's aching for you  
Chorus  
Can someone explain why I feel  
This burning pain inside, it tears me apart  
Makes me weak but I can't resist  
Chorus  

It's a bit hard to take  
But all good things must end  
Y' know it's sad but it's true  
I know my heart will ache  
And it will take time to mend  
But it's something I've got to do  
Cause I owe it all to you  
  
(Chorus)  
It's not over yet  
It's a new beginning  
I just gotta say I'm grateful for the time we've had  
It's not over yet  
It's a brand new start  
All I need to say is thank you  
From the bottom of my heart  
  
I need some time alone  
A little moment of silence  
So I can figure out where to go  
Don't know what comes and that's the beauty of tomorrow  
There's so many things to find  
All I need is time  
  
It's not over yet  
It's a new beginning  
I just gotta say I'm grateful for the time we've had  
It's not over yet  
It's a brand new start  
All I need to say is thank you  
From the bottom of my heart  
  
I take a long last look around  
Every moment, every sound  
It's all been worth fighting for  
Just because we close the door  
Doesn't mean it's over yet  
  
It's a new beginning  
And I just gotta say I'm grateful for the time we've had  
It's not over yet  
It's a brand new start  
I just go to say im grateful  
For each and every day  
  
It's not over yet (For each and every day)  
It's a new beginning (For each and every day)  
I just gotta say Im grateful for the time we've had (The time we've had)  
It's not over yet  
It's a new beginning (The time we've had)  
All I need to say is thank you  
From the bottom of my heart  
  
From the bottom of my heart

You're the ruler of your destiny  
Can I talk to you about a thing or two?  
It's not right that you're feeling blue  
Never ever let them get to you  
You know I've been right there where you are now  
It's all right, I'll show you how  
You can be, you can be what you wanna be  
You're the ruler of your destiny  
Whatever comes your way, no matter what they say  
Always let your soul shine, let your soul shine  
No matter what they do, you know it's up to you  
Always let your soul shine, let your soul shine  
It won't take too long before you know  
There's no other way to go  
Then straight to the top of the world  
Straight to the top of the world  
It's there, in your heart  
Don't let anyone tear it apart  
You can be, you can be what you wanna be  
You're the ruler of your destiny  
Whatever comes your way, no matter what they say  
Always let your soul shine, let your soul shine  
No matter what they do, you know it's up to you  
Always let your soul shine, let your soul shine  
Don't let go, there's someone here  
To see you through  
There's someone here for you  
Someone here for you  
You're the ruler of your destiny  
You can be what you want to be  
It's your life and you got the key  
Wake up, wake up, wake up now  
Gotta learn that you're in control  
Of your body, of your soul  
What matters at the end of the day  
Is if you make it shine  
Whatever comes your way, no matter what they say  
Always let your soul shine, let your soul shine  
No matter what they do, you know it's up to you  
Always let your soul shine, let your soul shine  
Whatever comes your way, no matter what they say  
Always let your soul shine, let your soul shine  
No matter what they do, you know it's up to you  
Always let your soul shine, let your soul shine  
Why don't you let your soul shine?  

I will live forever  
If you always keep me in your mind  
And it doesn't matter, how far I am  
If I ever leave you  
I am gonna be there by your side  
If you ever need me, well here I am  
  
I'm gonna live forever  
Don't you ever forget  
That all the stars in heaven  
Will shine for me  
I'm gonna live forever  
No never forget  
That no one's lost in heaven's eternity  
  
Hold the fire burning  
Life was never meant to be the end  
There's no way I'm turning, by accident  
I don't need to prove it  
I'm just ready for another stair  
Though my heart is moving, my soul is here  
  
I'm gonna live forever...  
  
In everyone  
There's a burning flame  
Goes on and on  
Do remember and I'll stay  
  
I'm gonna live forever...

[Chorus]  
Our love is still alive  
And all I want is just to be right by your side  
And all I'm asking you is give me one more try  
I know the future has a place for you and I  
Cause baby our love, our love is still alive  
  
You say that our love is gone and  
Whatever we did was wrong  
That everything we built is now history, yeah  
You've taken my heart away and I can't seem  
To make you stay but, baby I believe  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I've given it all to you and I've been living my life through  
You and I'm not gonna give in now,  
We've come too far I know that we're gonna work it out  
And even if you still doubt it, baby I believe  
  
[Chorus x 2]  
  
Believe me, things will get better  
Hold me, I'm more than a friend  
Trust me, I promise you one thing  
I'll stay with you till the end  
  
[Chorus x 3]Bosson Lyrics Index

If you feel the whole world is against you  
And you're irritated about what someone said  
Remember  
You control the thoughts that you are thinking  
It's a choice you make and it's all inside your head  
  
When you're late for work and stuck in traffic  
And you feel like Michael Douglas in "Falling down"  
And then some stupid driver makes you go ballistic  
Just kick back, relax  
And ignore that screaming down  
  
So, Love this life  
Love this life, fill it up with sunshine  
A happy thought  
Is all you need to keep the clouds away  
  
Love this life  
Love this life, fill it up with sunshine  
A little sunshine  
And everything is gonna go your way  
  
When you check the mirror in the morning  
You look pale and old and your waist's  
Hard to define  
And then your Doctor Slim is giving you a warning  
And you accept you'll never work for Calvin Klein  
  
So, love this life...  
  
Why do we worry about tomorrow today when  
Everyday proves us wrong about the worries we  
Had yesterday [x2]  
  
In 5 billion years or more the sun stops burning  
And this world will be a cold and lonely place  
And although our mother earth will keep on turning  
She will have to cope without the human race  
So it's time to love this life and seize the day  
  
So love this life...  
  
So love this life  
Love the ones that do not even deserve it  
And if you can't  
Just forgive them for the things they've done  
Love this life  
Love this life and let your troubled soul shine  
A little shine  
And everything is gonna go your way

Your one in a million, oh  
Your one in a million, woa oh  
One, one, one, one, one,  
  
Sometimes love can hit you everyday  
Sometimes you can fall for everyone you see  
But only one can really make me stay  
The sign, the one in the sky, has said to me  
  
[Chorus]  
Your one in a million  
Your once in a lifetime  
You made me discover one of the stars above us  
Your one in a million  
Your once in a lifetime  
You made me discover one of the stars above us  
  
I've been looking for that special one  
I've been searching for someone to give me love  
When I thought that all the hope was gone  
A smile and there you were and I was gone  
I always will remember how I felt that day  
A feeling indescribable to me, yeah  
I always knew there was an answer for my prayer  
And you, your the one, the one for me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
In the beginning I was cool and everything was possible  
They tried to catch me but it was impossible  
No one could hurt me it was my game  
Until I met you baby and it wasn't the same  
When you didn't want me, I wanted you  
Because the funny thing about it is I like the show  
I like it when it's difficult I like it when it's hard  
Then you know it's worth it that you find your heart  
(Whoa)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Your one in a million

I don't trust you that's what I like about you. Baby we are one of a  
Kind I can't reach you that's why I wanna have you  
  
It's been so easy easy come and easy go  
Going in the fastlane love is for feel and so are you  
I took some wrong turns now I get what I desirve  
Youre the one I serve you're the one  
Cause  
  
Chorus  
I don't trust you that's what I like about you  
I can't reach you that's why I wanna have you  
Wanna get to know you I wanna figure you out  
Becuse your different we're gonna be one tonight  
You met the right now cause we are just the same  
And I will show you cause I invented this game  
I'm coming at ya cause I've made up my mind  
This is it we are baby we are one of a kind  
Ohhhhhhhh  
Baby we are one of a kind

I didn't mean to was afraid to brake my own heart  
But now I'm ready ready to get what I desirvere  
Youre the one I serve  
Cause

Listening to the ground swift me of my feet falling in love with

Slap me in the face ready to let go falling in love with you  
  
Baby we are one of a kind  
Ohhhhhh  
We are one of a kind  
Ohhhhh  
Baby we are one of a kind  
Ohhhhhh

There are things that I regret  
There are things I can't forget  
There are things that believe  
Through the hints that I receive  
I'm not giving up not yet...  
  
So many things I wanna say  
But words are getting in my way  
So many things I wanna do  
I can make it up to you  
I believe we'll find a way  
  
Cause  
Sometimes it rains in december  
(we all know that)  
Sometimes the snow falls in june  
(Don't you know that)  
Although it hurts to remember  
Our fall in september  
I know that I'll never surrender...  
  
Can I get it through to you  
In spite the stupid things I do  
I never meant to say those words  
Wanna see you though it hurts  
Wish that we could talk it through  
  
I try to call you on the phone  
Just to see if you're at home  
I try to find the words to say  
How I miss you everyday  
Baby please pick up the phone...  
  
Cause  
Sometimes it rains in december...  
(we all know that)  
Sometimes the snow falls in june  
(Don't you know that)  
Although it hurts to remember  
Our fall in september  
I know that I'll never surrender...  
  
Sometimes it rains in december  
(we all know that)  
Sometimes the snow falls in june  
(Don't you know that)  
Although it hurts to remember  
Our fall in september  
I know that I'll never surrender...  
  
Sometimes it rains in december  
Sometimes the snow falls in june  
Although it hurts to remember  
Our fall in september  
I know that I'll never surrender...  
  
Sometimes it rains in december  
(Sometimes it rains)  
Sometimes the snow falls in june  
(Sometimes the snow falls in june)  
Although it hurts to remember  
Our fall in september  
I know that I'll never surrender...  
I'll never surrender...  
I'll never surrender...  
I'll never surrender...

Lyrics:bosson, music: bosson  
Gonna tell the world that I've fallen for you  
I've got a secret, I can't hold it back anymore  
I've got to share it with everyone I know  
It's a lifetime waiting for someone like you  
I'm falling, a feeling too good to be true, so true  
I write you a song on the radio  
I want them to know that I'll die for you  
Chorus:  
This is the right time, oh oh this is the moment  
I'm gonna tell the world that I've fallen for you x2  
I never thought that, there was a space inside me  
But you found it, a place where you wanted to be  
I'm happy, you gave me time to see  
I'm falling, for the first time I feel that I'm free  
I write you a song on the radio  
I want them to know that I'll die for you  
Chorus  
I'll write you a poem in the magazine  
I'll buy some time in the 7 o'clock news  
I run through the city naked shout and scream  
Heeyoo heyoooooo  
I'll drop some flyers from an aeroplane  
I'm making a movie where I'm singing in the rain  
I send out the message to the outer space  
Calling earth, ground control, do you read me?  
I read you, over  
We've got a small problem up here  
We found a guy who says he's got a message for the world  
I think he's really fallen in love...over and out  
Chorus  
Ohooo heeyooooo  
Ohooo can't hold it back no more  
Ohooo heeyooooo  
Ohooo gonna tell the world  
Chorus  

I wake up in the morning while you're still asleep  
I wipe away another tear from your cheek  
This is not the first time you've been crying in your sleep  
I know that you're affected by what people say  
But I can promise you there will come a day  
As long as we're together our love will find a way  
  
[Chorus:]  
I would love to run away with you  
I wish that I could run away with you  
Without a trace, a secret place  
Where nothing stands in our way  
I would love to run away with you  
I wish that I could run away with you  
To someplace far, shinning star  
The two of us all alone  
  
We were born and raised in two different worlds  
Separated by our faith and belief  
Our love was not accepted but we were meant to be  
And even if they tried to tear our love apart  
You and I will always share the same heart  
There's nothing they can do cause this is our destiny  
I'll give up my life just to be with you  
I'll take you where ever you want me to  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
You, and I love belongs to you,  
You and I, love belongs to us,  
I'll give up my life if you want me to  
I'll take you where ever you want to go,  
Where you want to go  
  
[Chorus x 2]

I am lost There's no spark  
I am tumbling around in the dark  
All alone out of sight  
I am desperately seeking a light  
  
Can't believe,  
I can't believe that you are gone  
But I am trying to move on  
Someone tell me it's just a bad dream  
That it's just not true  
  
Say you will be home for dinner or  
Say you will be working late, but  
Say you will come home to me  
Like you used to do, cause I'm missing you so  
  
Say you will lay down beside me and  
Say you will just smile and kiss me and  
Say you will be holding me  
Like you used to do  
Cause I still love you  
  
As a wife, as a mom  
We were waiting for our third to come  
You and I had it all  
But it was changing from a simple call  
  
Could not breathe  
And my whole world was falling apart  
Leaving pain inside my heart  
Someone tell me it's just a bad dream  
That it's just not true  
  
Say you will be home for dinner or  
Say you will be working late, but  
Say you will come home to me  
Like you used to do, cause I'm missing you so  
  
Say you will lay down beside me and  
Say you will just smile and kiss me and  
Say you will be holding me  
Like you used to do  
Cause I still love you  
  
And even if you're gone you're still not far  
You're here with me, you live inside my heart  
Nothing in this world will be the same  
Except my love will never change...  
  
Say you will be home for dinner or  
Say you will be working late, but  
Say you will come home to me  
Like you used to do, cause I'm missing you so  
  
Say you will lay down beside me and  
Say you will just smile and kiss me and  
Say you will be holding me  
Like you used to do  
Cause I still love you

I get up, to get a real bite of life  
A slice of love, no goodbyes  
Still keeps me satisfied  
I wanna hold on to that feeling  
When you're not sure if your dreaming  
I love, to fall asleep next to you  
  
I'm just a simple man wishing  
My queen stays by my side  
And if she wants me, I'll promise to fight  
I'm just a simple man wishing  
My nightmares stays untrue  
And if they do - I'll give my life, to you  
  
I get up, to see the sun set again  
Wishing that it never ends  
Watching lovers turn to friends  
I wanna feel like believing  
Knowing you, gave me a meaning  
I love, to fall asleep next to you  
  
I'm just a simple man...  
My queen stays by my side  
And if she wants me, I'll promise to fight  
I'm just a simple man wishing  
My nightmares stays untrue  
And if they do - I'll give my life, to you  
  
In a world where everything remains in shadows  
The only ray of light is knowing that  
You'll be by my side  
  
I'm just a simple man...  
My queen stays by my side  
And if she wants me, I'll promise to fight  
I'm just a simple man wishing  
My nightmares stays untrue  
And if they do - I'll give my life, to you

Hey hey little princess  
So tell me what is your secret  
How do you make my whole world spin around on your own  
  
Your eyes shine like a sunrise by the sea  
Your smile is melting an iceberg inside of me  
Your love is pure as the water fresh from the spring  
  
That is why you're making this world a much more beautiful place  
And I am thankful for every new day  
I get to be with you  
I get to be with you  
  
Hey hey little princess  
So let me tell you a secret  
You are the star in the universe for me  
  
Innocent as a landscape covered with snow  
A colourful mind like a rainbow you've got it too  
Your heart is strong as a mountain and warm like the sun  
  
That is why you're making this world a much more beautiful place  
And I am thankful for every new day  
I get to be with you  
  
That is why you're making this world a much more beautiful place  
And I am thankful for every new day  
I get to be with you  
I get to be with you  
  
All the people that surround you, the people that you meet  
Are falling like leaves from a September tree  
When the sky is dark and cloudy and grey you're the candlelight  
I see it's shinning for me, It's shinning for me...  
  
That is why you're making this world a much more beautiful place  
And I am thankful for every new day with you  
And this one is for you.. for you  
I get to be with you

We'll be rockin' till the morning after  
If you stay one more night with me  
Just stay one more night with me  
If you stay one more night with me  
We'll be rockin' till the morning after  
  
Your body's close to mine  
When we're kissing I am opening the door  
And we forget the time  
Gonna take you where you've never been before  
  
Sharing every breath we take  
It feels like every minute is a wall  
The magic moment is awake  
And I want it all  
  
[Chorus]  
If you stay one more night with me  
Just stay one more night with me  
If you stay one more night with me  
We'll be rockin' till the morning after  
  
[Repeats]  
I'm coming on to you  
Let me take you on the journey of your life  
I'll show what I can do  
Leave it to imagination, close your eyes  
Your lips are filled with heat  
And your heart is beating faster with the treat  
Your hands are soft and warm  
And I touch you from your head down to your feet  
You're bringing down the stars for me  
I feel I'm on the verge of lose my cool  
And heaven is the place to be  
Beyond my control  
  
[Chorus: Repeats]

Do you remember our place where we used to meet  
Down by the sea  
And all the crazy plans we made  
And the promises, we swore to keep  
I was young and so were you  
But we both could feel our love was true  
There was nothing in this world  
That we couldn't do... Oh...  
  
I'll go back in time, to when you were mine  
I would trade my life for one more summer with you  
I'll erase my mind, if I could rewind  
I would trade my life for one more summer with you  
  
Do you remember all the songs that you used to play  
And I used to write, and all the fantasies we had  
Of becoming stars, over a night  
Now I am here and I am proud of  
What I've acheved, on my own  
But succes can not replace ou and without you,  
I'm no one...  
  
I'll go back...  
  
I found my love when I was seventeen  
And you, you were on fire, the queen of my heart  
And we, we were on fire, fire invincible tearm  
And we promised we would never part  
But then one day in the beginning of fall  
When the rain pushed the summer away  
I went back to our place, and you were gone,  
They told me that you left that same day...  
  
Oh... Oh...  
  
I'll go back...

Every day and every night, I'm lonesome  
The one I thought I'd never find, I lost somehow  
We had a dream  
In which our love could never die  
  
A messy place an empty mind, stii feel you  
An unmade bed a glass of wine, I'm used to  
I'll find a reason, a new meaning to hold on to  
But till I know I want to spend my time with you...  
  
Thinking about you in the morning  
I am thinking about you in the night  
I am thinking of the tears and the laughter  
And all the time we used to fool around  
I am missing all the crazy days with you and I  
  
Our favourite songs and tv-shows remind me  
Baby talk, internal jokes, sweet memories  
We had a dream  
In which our love would last forever  
We had a dream  
But God has changed our destiny  
  
I'm spending days just staring at the ceiling  
My tears they fall no matter what I'm feeling  
I'll find a reason a new meaning to hold on to  
But till I know I want to spend my time with you  
  
Thinking...  
  
I'm missing all the crazy days, with you and I  
I'm missing and the lovely days, with you and I  
I wanna spend my time with you  
As long as I can do  
Till I find a meaning to  
Hold on to...

Baby this is our life  
And I still believe that love is the answer  
This is our life  
I sit alone on the balcony  
In the middle of the night  
And everything is calm  
And everything is right  
Thinking back on the time  
I was depending on somebody  
Tellin' me what to do  
I know what to do  
Because we're born with freedom  
We can live our lives  
The way we want  
And just the way we feel  
We will discover the truth  
For me, it's love  
My love is true  
Baby this is our life  
I still believe that love is the answer  
This is our life  
I still believe our love will last forever  
This is our life  
Baby this is our life  
This is our life  
We're heading into the future  
But we're running out of time  
And we're running out of gas  
We forget why we're here  
If we stop for a moment  
Give it all up for care  
I'm taking care of you  
Take good care of me  
Because we're born with freedom  
We can live our lives  
The way we want  
And just the way we feel  
And if we follow our heart  
We will discover the truth  
For me, it's love  
My love is true  
Take care of yourself  
Be nice to your friends  
And visit your relatives once in a while  
Give love to your family  
Take care of your baby  
Don't be afraid to open your heart  

We Live and we die  
And we learn to find  
The things we live and die for  
  
I don't want to be an ordinary man  
No I don't want to be as neat as a new pin  
I don't care about just being safe and calm  
Give it up for little li li life  
Give it all up for little li li life  
  
I don't want to be a worker everyday  
No I don't want to be a boss that you obey  
I don't care about what people might just say  
Give it up for little li li life  
Give it all up for little li li life  
  
And the time that we have inside it keeps on ticking, till the end  
So it's time that we live our lives and celebrating  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't want to say I didn't take the chance  
I don't want to say I never learned the dance  
I want to be someone, someone they show respect  
Give it all up for a little li li life  
Give it all up for a little li li life  
  
And the time that we have inside it keeps on ticking, till the end  
So it's time that we live our lives and celebrating  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Life is all to short to spend on doing boring things,  
And I want and I want I want to have fun  
Holding on to be the one I am  
Holding on to be the one I am...  
  
[Chorus]

Most of the time  
I'm advising my friends  
About what's wrong or right  
When they call me at night  
  
Now I'm confused,  
Cause my mind says I'm a fool  
That it's time to say goodbye  
But my tears cannot lie  
And my heart says I will lose if I try...  
  
What if I would sacrifice my life for you  
What if I would say I'd give up my dreams too  
What if you were meant to be my destiny  
But what if love, was never meant for you and me  
  
I'm trying real hard  
Cause I know that a friend is something you can't be  
Our love is too deep  
Or is this our fate  
Just a never ending battle no one else can see  
I refuse to give in  
But I'm afraid to start something we can't win  
  
What if I would sacrifice my life for you  
What if I would say I'd give up my dreams too  
What if you were meant to be my destiny  
But what if love, was never meant for you and me  
  
Love is magic  
Love is irresistible  
But love is fearless and not able to see  
Love is gorgeous  
Love is unpredictable  
But love is brainless and sometimes so are we...  
  
What if I would sacrifice my life for you  
What if I would I'd give up my dreams too  
What if you were meant to be my destiny  
But what if love, was never meant for you and me  
  
And our love was never meant for you and me  
No our love was never meant for you and me

Lyrics:bosson, music: bosson  
You're close to me, still so far away  
Wanna take my hand, but something's in the way  
Sometimes I get the feeling that you don't care  
I know you've got it tough, but it's just not fair  
What about me...you see...  
Chorus:  
When you touch my hand  
I wanna fly to wonderland, with you  
When you look at me  
With the cutest smile man can see your dignity  
The show goes on, I am used to the scene  
It's the same old song, love can be so mean  
Honey stop playing the silly game  
I know you've got another but he'll never be  
What I'll be...for you...  
Chorus  
Come on baby why can't you see  
We could run this thing together just you and me  
I beg you please I'm down on my knees  
One day you will understand how much  
You mean to me  
Chorus  

Some meet in the strangest places  
Some meet in the place that they work in  
Some meet in their own backyard  
  
Some say it was love at first sight  
Some say that they never could imagine  
Some say that they'd find the right one  
  
Chorus  
Where are you?  
When I'm calling your name, oh baby  
Where are you?  
When I'm here all alone, where are you?  
Where are you?  
When I reach out my hand, oh baby  
Where are you when I need you most, oh baby  
Where are you?  
  
Some meet at the supermarket  
Some meet on the summer vacation  
Some meet at the local bar  
  
Some say it was meant to be them  
Some say they've been waiting for a long time  
Some say that they found the right one  
  
Some meet cause they like each other  
Some meet for a little bit of lovin'  
Some meet in their father's car  
  
Some say they're getting married  
Some believe in trust and understanding  
They say that they find the right one  
  
Chorus 2x  
  
There is this one song I can't stop in my head  
And I keep on going on and it's makin' me stronger  
One song I can't stop in my head  
And it makes me feel good so I can hold on much longer  
Repeat  
  
Chorus

Xanadu  
  
Love isn't easy when it's too far away  
You need a lot of faith and dedication  
I don't have that problem, I see you everyday  
An hour filled with hope and inspiration...  
  
[Chorus x 2]  
Xanadu, I've been waiting my whole life  
For a chance to meet a girl just like you  
And I believe it's gonna be you and me  
If you will get to know me too...  
  
I love all about you, but you don't know who I am  
Sure is a complicated situation  
So what if I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming I am your man  
And we wake up in a real life conversation...  
  
[Chorus x 2]  
  
I feel in love with a girl on tv  
She captivates me On reality tv  
  
She's looking at me but she cannot see me.  
I hope she will be more than a fantasy....  
  
[Chorus x 2]  
  
I fell in love with a girl on tv  
She captivates me On reality tvbosson Lyrics Index

You, you make all my dreams come true  
  
Another time, a lesson learned  
Another one, I crashed and burned  
But I believe there is someone for everyone  
A small cafe and lots of noise  
A crowded place but just one voice  
And from that moment I saw your face  
I just knew...  
  
You, you make all my dreams come true  
An angel smiled at me  
The finest thing I've seen  
  
(Baby)  
You, you make all my dreams come true  
A shining star I see  
That heaven sent to me  
That heaven sent to me...  
  
I've been ignored, I've been deceived  
I hardly enjoyed the goals I achieved  
And what's the meaning of success  
That you can't share  
Although I'm used to be apart  
I'll never get used to a broken heart  
But when I see you I gladly  
Take that risk again  
  
You, you make all my dreams come true  
An angel smiled at me  
The finest thing I've seen  
  
(Baby)  
You, you make all my dreams come true  
A shining star I see  
That heaven sent to me  
That heaven sent to me...  
  
You...  
  
I fell in love with you today  
I fell in love when I first saw you  
And I hope you'll see me too  
And if you don't I do, understand  
And that is ok, but I have never  
Felt this way  
  
You, you make all my dreams come true  
An angel smiled at me  
The finest thing I've seen  
Baby you, you make all my dreams come true  
A shining star I see  
That heaven sent to me  
That heaven sent to me  
  
You...  
You...  
  
You, you make all my dream come true  
I hope and I believe  
That we are meant to be
