Out here in the fields, I fight for my meals  
I get my back into my living  
I don't need to fight, to prove I'm right  
I don't need to be forgiven  
  
Don't cry, don't raise your eye  
It's only teenage wasteland  
  
Sally, take my hand  
Well travel south, 'cross land  
Put out the fire and don't look past my shoulder  
  
The exodus is here  
The happy ones are near  
Let's get together before we get much older  
  
Teenage wasteland  
It's only teenage wasteland  
Teenage wasteland  
(it's only) teenage wasteland  
  
They're all wasted!

Waitin', watchin' the clock, it's four o'clock, it's got to stop  
Tell him, take no more, she practices her speech  
As he opens the door, she rolls over  
Pretends to sleep as he looks her over  
  
She lies and says she's in love with him, can't find a better man  
She dreams in colour, she dreams in red, can't find a better man  
Can't find a better man  
Can't find a better man  
Oh  
  
Talkin' to herself, there's no one else who needs to know  
She tells herself, oh  
Memories back when she was bold and strong  
And waiting for the world to come along  
Swears she knew it, now she swears he's gone  
  
She lies and says she's in love with him, can't find a better man  
She dreams in colour, she dreams in red, can't find a better man  
She lies and says she still loves him, can't find a better man  
She dreams in colour, she dreams in red, can't find a better man  
Can't find a better man  
Can't find a better man  
Yeah  
  
She loved him, yeah, she don't want to leave this way  
She feeds him, yeah, that's why she'll be back again  
  
Can't find a better man  
Can't find a better man  
Can't find a better man  
Can't find a better man

I used to be crustacean  
In an underwater nation  
And I surf in celebration  
Of a billion adaptations  
  
Got me a big wave, ride me a big wave, got me a big wave  
Got me a big wave, ride me a big wave, got me a big wave  
  
I feel the need  
Planted in me  
Millions of years ago  
Can't you see  
The oceans size?  
Defining time  
And tide  
Arising  
Arms laid upon me  
Being so kind  
To let me ride  
  
I scream in affirmation  
Of connecting dislocations  
And exceeding limitation  
By achieving levitation  
  
Got me a big wave, ride me a big wave, got me a big wave.  
Got me a big wave, ride me a big wave, got me a big wave.  
  
I feel the need  
Planted in me  
Millions of years ago  
Can't you see  
The oceans size?  
Defining time  
And tide  
Arising  
Arms laid upon me  
Being so kind  
To let me ride  
  
Got me a ride  
I got me a ride

Hey, oh  
Sheets of empty canvas  
Untouched sheets of clay  
Were laid spread out before me  
As her body once did  
All five horizons  
Revolved around her soul  
As the earth to the sun  
Now the air I tasted and breathed  
Has taken a turn  
  
Oh and all I taught her was everything  
Oh I know she gave me all that she wore  
And now my bitter hands  
Chafe beneath the clouds  
Of what was everything  
Oh the pictures have  
All been washed in black  
Tattooed everything  
I take a walk outside  
I'm surrounded by  
Some kids at play  
I can feel their laughter  
So why do I sear  
Oh, and twisted thoughts that spin  
Round my head  
I'm spinning  
Oh, I'm spinning  
How quick the sun can, drop away  
  
And now my bitter hands  
Cradle broken glass  
Of what was everything  
All the pictures had  
All been washed in black  
Tattooed everything  
All the love gone bad  
Turned my world to black  
Tattooed all I see  
All that I am  
All I'll be  
  
Yeah  
I know someday you'll have a beautiful life  
I know you'll be a star  
In somebody else's sky  
But why  
Why  
Why can't it be  
Why can't it be mine

Exponentially serving  
Perpetually unnerving  
Vehicle swerving  
The adjectives they are all a blurring  
Freud walking the sidelines  
Clipboard, score on the brain  
Black magic viente why tres  
Makes me sane  
Hormones firing like a fifty foot roman, yeah  
Please don't make me explain  
Don't matter anyway  
Phantom pain in my brain  
It's all that's left of my leg  
Black and red and yellow, black and red and yellow  
Heard you repeat a what ya heard  
Me knowing the truth I cannot concur na-na  
Hormones firing like a fifty foot roman, yeah  
Please don't make me explain  
Doesn't matter anyway  
Hormones firing like a fifty foot roman, yeah  
Please don't make me explain  
Yo bro tell us what's happenin' um I'm on the west  
West side of, on the west coast  
Give me a jingle uh when you get in  
From where the fuck you're at  
Hormones firing like a fifty foot roman, yeah  
Please don't make me explain  
Doesn't fucking matter anyway  
Hormones firing like a fifty foot Roman, yeah  
Please don't make me explain

(This song was played live in Champaign, il)  
  
Some people seem so obsessed with the morning  
Get up early just to watch the sunrise  
Others like it more when there's fire in the sky  
Worship the sun when it's high  
Some people go for those sultry evenings  
Cocktails in the blue, red, and grey  
But I like every minute of the day  
I dig every second  
So long as you are on my mind  
Each precious moment has its special charm  
It's all right when you're around, rain or shine  
I know a crowd who only lives after midnight  
Their faces always seem so pale  
And then there's friends of mine who must have sunlight  
They say a suntan never fails  
I know I was a man who worked a night shift  
I was lucky to get a job and some pay  
Now I like every minute of the day  
I dig every second  
I could laugh in the snow and rain  
I get a buzz from being cold and wet  
The pleasure seems to balance out the pain  
And so you see that I'm completely crazy  
I even shun the south of France  
The people on my hill they say I'm lazy  
But when they sing I... Uh  
But when they sleep I sing and dance  
I know a crowd who... Or something  
Cocktails in the blue, red and grey  
But I like every minute of the day  
I like every minute of the day...

Who's got the brain of JFK?  
What's it mean to us now? (yeah)  
Pause, It sounds distrust  
But I can tell you this is no lie  
  
The whole world will be different soon  
The whole world will be relieving  
  
You you've been taught  
Whipped into shape now they got you in line  
Stand behind the stripes  
There will be order so give it a good mind  
The whole world will be different soon  
The whole world will be relieving  
  
And by name  
The name they gave me  
The name I'm letting go  
  
The whole world will be different soon  
The whole world will be relieving  
The whole world will be different soon, soon

Consider me an object  
Put me in a vacuum  
Free of all conditions  
Free of air and friction  
Yea, I'll be hanging upside down.  
And there I will swing  
For all eternity  
Fell it rising, yea next stop falling  
Feel it rising, comatose, with no fear of falling  
Consider me an abscess  
Leave me in my vacuum  
Blood on all the pistons  
Running my transmission  
Feel it rising, yea next stop falling  
Feel it rising, comatose, with no fear of falling  
Feel it rising, yeah next stop falling  
Feel It rising  
High above I'll break the law,  
If it's illegal to be in love,  
Leave the hatred, on the cross  
Yea I'll be hanging upside down and here I will swing  
For all eternity  
Feel it rising, yea next stop falling  
Feel it rising, comatose with no fear of falling  
Feel it rising, yea, next stop falling  
Feel it rising  
Something never thought you'd be part of...

If I keep holding out  
Will the light shine through?  
Under this broken roof  
It's only rain that I feel  
I've been wishin' out the days  
Oh oh oh  
Come back  
  
I have been planning out  
All that I'd say to you  
Since you slipped away  
Know that I still remain true  
I've been wishin' out the days  
Please say that if you hadn't have gone now  
I wouldn't have lost you another way  
From wherever you are  
Oh oh oh oh  
Come back  
  
And these days, they linger on, yeah, yeah  
And in the night, I've been waiting for  
A real possibility that I may meet you in my dreams  
I go to sleep  
  
If I don't fall apart  
Will my memory stay clear?  
So you had to go  
And I had to remain here  
But the strangest thing to date  
So far away and yet you feel so close  
I'm not going to question it any other way  
It must be an open door for you  
To come back  
  
And the days they linger on, yeah  
Every night I'm waiting for  
The real possibility that I may meet you in my dreams  
Sometimes you're there and you're talking back to me  
Come the morning I could swear you're next to me  
And it's ok  
  
It's ok, it's ok  
  
I'll be here  
Come back, come back  
I'll be here  
Come back, come back  
I'll be here  
Come back, come back  
Oooooooo  
Oooooooo  
Oooooooo  
Oooooooo

Consider me an object  
Free of all infliction  
Free of all conditions  
Free of ambitions  
I've been sittin' upside down  
And then I will swing  
For all eternity  
Never forward  
Yes I know it  
Oh feeling like  
Its something I never thought you'd be a part of??  
Bring me to a doctor?  
Maybe an asylum?  
Calling on decisions  
Breathing amunition  
Feeling righteous?  
Yeah that's not forward  
Feeling like there's something I never thought you'd be part of  
Coming forward  
Yeah forwards, backwards  
Coming close yeah  
Hang on  
Sail on  
I'm feeling forward  
But backing off  
Falling down  
Yeah I've been sitting upside down  
And then I will slip  
For all eternity

Light green to green, dark green, brown  
Every life is falling down  
Brown to black, it's coming back  
Dies to be part of the ground  
Seed to seedling, root to stem  
  
Eyes, no eyes, there's no difference,  
Every life is looking in  
Swallowing seeds on the deathbed,  
Dig a hole in, the garden.  
  
Everyone is practicing,  
But this world's an accident.  
I was the fool because I thought  
  
I thought the world  
Turns out the world thought me  
It's all the other way round  
We're upside down  
  
Daddy's gone up flames,  
But this ain't no movie  
This ain't no book you can close  
When the big lie hits your eye.  
  
Everybody's practicing,  
Our world's an accident  
I was the fool because I thought  
  
Let the fluency set it down.  
There's an upside of down.  
  
The moon is rolling around.

Well  
Mom and dad  
Said we could

My stocking  
On a wall

Well  
I tried  
To get  
A little kiss  
From  
A pretty  
Little miss  
She  
Slapped me down  
And said  
"You jerk  
Mistletoe  
Doesn't work"  
  
I don't believe  
In Christmas  
I don't believe  
In Christmas  
I don't believe

Down. Fall by the wayside no getting out.  
Down. Cry me a river dried up and dammed.  
The names can be changed but the place is still the same.  
I am loaded. Told that all's for naught. Holds me down.  
  
Rise. Life is in motion. I'm stuck in line.  
Rise. You can't be neutral on a moving train.  
One day the symptoms fade. Think I'll throw these pills away.  
And if hope could grow from dirt like me. It can be done.  
  
Won't let the light escape from me.  
Won't let the darkness swallow me.  
  
So long.

Drifting, drifting, drifting away  
I got myself a mansion, then I gave it away  
It's not the world that's heavy, it's just the things that you save  
And I'm drifting, drifting away  
Drifting, drifting, drifting along  
I rid myself of worries, and my worries were gone  
I only run when I want to and I sleep like a dog  
I'm drifting, drifting along  
The suit coats say, "there is money to be made"  
They get so excited, nothing gets in their way  
My road it may be lonely just because it's not paved  
It's good for drifting, drifting away  
All the suit coats say, "there is money to be made"  
They get so excited, nothing get's in their way  
My road it may be lonely just because it's not paved  
It's good for drifting, drifting away  
Drifting, drifting, drifting, uh huh  
I feel like going back there, but never for long  
I sometimes wonder if they know that I'm gone  
I'm drifting, drifting along  
Drifting, drifting along, drifting, drifting along.

I'm questioning my education  
Is my education who I am now?  
While you're deciding, I've been finding  
Looking around in the here and now  
  
If I've been taught from the beginning  
Would my fears now by winning?  
I'm questioning my own equation  
Is my own equation relevant somehow?  
  
The flags are waving, the news is breaking  
See the man who can't pick out his own tie  
If I've been taught from the beginning  
Would my fears now be winning?  
  
A wild world, figuring out the answers  
I'll be in my own dance and iiii...  
I'm questioning my education  
Rewind and what does it show?  
  
Could be, the truth it becomes you  
I'm a seed, wondering why it grows...

The sirens scream wanton attention  
Time to take heed and change directions  
Time to take stock and make omissions  
  
Evacuation  
Evacuation  
  
Time to take leave all formal functions  
Time to plant seeds of reconstruction  
No time this time to feign reluctance  
  
It's like you're waiting for a diamond shore to wash your way  
Bets put aside, you're evil, let's crawl into your face  
A vision, vague or not, raising a frightful wake-you-up  
  
Time for evacuation  
Evacuation  
Evacuation  
Evacuation  
Evacuation  
Evacuation  
Evacuation  
  
There was a solemn man who watched his twilight disappear in the sand  
Altered by a fallen eagle, a warning sign  
He sensed worry could be strength, with a plan said time for  
  
Evacuation  
Evacuation  
Evacuation  
Evacuation  
  
Evacuation, evacuation  
Evacuation, evacuation  
Evacuation, evacuation  
Evacuation, evacuation  
Evacuation, evacuation  
Evacuation, evacuation

Freezin' rests his head on a pillow made of concrete again  
Oh Feelin' maybe he will see a little better set of days  
Oh hand out faces that he sees time again ain't that familiar  
Oh dark grin he can't help when he's happy he looks insane  
Even flow  
  
Thoughts arrive like butterflies  
Oh he don't know  
So he chases them away  
Someday yet he'll begin his life again  
Life again  
  
Kneelin' looking through the paper though he doesn't know how to read  
Prayin', now to something that has never showed him anything  
Oh, feelin', understands the weather or that winters on it's way, yeah  
Oh, ceilings, few and far between are the legal halls of shame  
Even flow  
  
Thoughts arrive like butterflies  
Oh, he don't know  
So he chases them away  
Someday yet he'll begin his life again  
Whispering hands, carry him away  
Him away, him away  
Yeah!  
Woo  
Oh yeah yeah

Sometimes I'm right then I can be wrong  
My own beliefs are in my songs  
A butcher, a banker, Jack Irons on drums  
Makes no difference what group I'm in  
I am everyday people  
  
Then it's the blue ones who can't accept  
The green ones for living with  
The black ones tryin' to be a skinny one  
Different strokes for different folks  
And so on and so on and scooby dooby dooby  
  
Ooh sha sha  
We gotta live together  
  
I am no better and neither are you  
We're all the same whatever we do  
You love me you hate me  
You know me and then  
Still can't figure out the scene I'm in  
I am everyday people  
  
Then it's the new man  
That doesn't like the short man  
For being such a rich one  
That will not help the poor one  
Different strokes for different folks  
And so on and so on scooby dooby dooby  
  
Ooh sha sha  
We got to live together  
  
There is a yellow one that won't  
Accept the black one  
That won't accept the red one  
That won't accept the white one  
  
Different strokes for different folks  
And so on and so on and  
Scooby dooby dooby  
Ooh sha sha  
I am everyday people

Various dates)  
  
Something to remember me by  
Something freezing your hand  
Something so you feel all grown up when you call my name  
  
Oh, I'm falling down...  
Oh, I'm falling...  
I don't know when I'll be up  
  
When I call, please remember  
Frozen like stone, yeah  
He's only flesh and blood  
I'll be gone, yeah...  
Just a memory passing like pages in a book  
  
I'm falling down...  
I'm falling... (2x)  
I don't know if I'll get up  
You're a boy... (3x)  
  
I know why you're here  
Can't guess your side  
Oh no, the cry of a newborn child  
Can't feel the heat  
Of something fresh  
Can somebody hide me  
I cannot hold on... (2x)  
I cannot hold on, child

How good is he?  
How warm are his eyes  
You'll see it's not a reprise  
Did he arrive  
  
Too late and too tethered away  
To put on his suit and his tie?  
How good is he?  
How warm is his heart  
  
Or ego telling him which place to park  
Did he relate, the message is clearly hardly  
Grounds for dismissal outright  
Grounds for dismissal outright  
  
I wake up and wait up  
When anger's in fashion  
I wake up and wait up  
It echoes through the mansions  
  
I wake up and wait up  
When April's in may, oh uh oh  
I wake up and wait up  
The answers are fatal  
  
The answers are fatal  
When I wait up and wake up  
The answers are fatal  
If he's truly out of sight  
  
Is he truly out of mind?  
If he's truly out of sight..

Some folks are born  
Made to wave that flag  
Ooh that red, white 'n blue  
And when they play  
'Hail to the Cheif'  
Ooh they point the cannon at you, lord  
  
It ain't me, it ain't me  
I ain't no fortunate son  
It ain't me, it ain't me  
I ain't no fortunate one, no  
  
Some folks are born  
Silver spoon in hand  
Lord don't they help themselves?  
And when the taxman  
Knocks on their door  
Ooh the house looks like a rummage sale, yeah  
  
It ain't me, it ain't me  
I ain't no fortunate son  
It ain't me, it ain't me  
I ain't no millionaires son, no, no  
  
Some folks are born  
Starspangled eyes  
Ooh they send you out to war  
And when Australia asks  
'How much do we get?'  
Ooh they just ask for more and more and more and more and more and...  
  
It ain't me, it ain't me  
I ain't no millionaires son, no  
It ain't me, it ain't me  
I ain't no fortunate one, one, one  
It ain't me, it ain't me  
I ain't no CIA son, no  
It ain't me, it ain't me  
I ain't no fortunate son, son, son

Neil Young) (various dates)  
Mindless drifter on the road...why do I...  
Carry such an easy load...why do I...  
It's how you look, and how you feel...why do I...  
You must have a heart of steel...why do I...  
Why do I keep fuckin' up?  
I can see you on a hill...why do I...  
Comatose but walking still...why do I...  
Curves beneath your flowing gown ...why do I...  
Only I could bring you down...why do I...  
Why do I keep fuckin' up?  
Dogs that lick and dogs that bite...why do I...  
Hounds that howl through the night...why do I...  
Broken leashes all over the floor...why do I...  
Keys left hanging in a swinging door...why do I...  
Why do I keep fuckin' up?  
Fuckin' up...fuckin' up...fuckin' up

If I ever were to lose you,  
I'd surely lose myself  
Everything I have found here,  
I've not found by myself,  
Try and sometimes you'll succeed,  
To make this man of me  
All of my stolen missing parts  
I've no need for anymore  
  
I believe,  
And I believe 'cause I can see,  
Our future days,  
Days of you and me  
  
Back when I was feeling broken,  
I focused on a prayer  
You came deep as the ocean  
It's something something out there here  
All the complexities and games  
No one wins, but somehow, they still play  
All the missing crooked hearts  
They may die, but in us they live on  
  
I believe,  
And I believe 'cause I can see,  
Our future days,  
Days of you and me  
  
When hurricanes and cyclones rage,  
When wind turned dirt to dust,  
When floods they came or tides they raised ever,  
Closer became us  
  
All the promises at sundown,  
I meant them like the rest,  
All the demons used to come around,  
I'm grateful now they've left  
  
So persistent in my ways,  
Here a angel, lying here to stay  
No resistance, no alarms, please this is just too good to be gone  
  
I believe,  
And I believe 'cause I can see,  
Our future days,  
Days of you and me,  
You and me,  
It's you and me

The direction of the eye  
So misleading  
The defection of the soul  
Nauseously quick  
I don't question  
Our existence  
I just question  
Our modern needs  
  
I will walk, with my hands bound  
I will walk, with my face blood  
I will walk, with my shadow flag  
  
Into your garden  
Garden of stone  
After all is done  
We're still alone  
I won't be taken  
Yet I'll go  
  
I will walk, with my hands bound  
I will walk, with my face blood  
I will walk, with my shadow flag  
  
Into your garden  
Garden of stone  
I don't show  
I don't share  
I don't need  
What you have to give

I want for to lay down, I'm waiting 'till sundown  
I'm searching the haystacks, water is sunshine, wait for the moment  
The moment between us, the fire is made now, harder to touch  
I wanted to get right  
I wanted to get right  
I wanted to get right with you  
Bakers dozen parades, stand and debate  
Out single file, nine in a row, swear if you must  
Keeping your boots on, float with the now, hot to the touch  
Concrete underground, cast out everyday, the dregs of society  
Underbelly, inside of me, rejoice and follow thee  
I wanted to get right  
I wanted to get right  
I wanted to get right with it, with you  
With...you...  
Yeah  
I wanted to get right  
I wanted to get right  
I wanted to get right

The mind is grey like the city, packing in and overgrown  
Love is deep, dig it out  
Standing in a hole alone  
Working for something that one can never hold  
A place in the clouds  
Good place to hide oh my oh...  
So I'm flying (away, away)  
Driving (away, away)  
Finding hope in ways I missed before  
I missed before  
The tv, she talks to me  
Breaking news and building walls  
Selling me what I don't need  
I never knew soap made you taller  
So I'm riding (away, away)  
Hiding (away, away)  
So much talk it makes no sense at all  
My senses have gone... awol, awol, awol, awol, awol...  
So I'm hiding (away, away)  
Driving (away, away)  
Passing new friends I won't know at all  
Won't know at all  
It doesn't hurt when I bleed  
But my memories, they eat me  
I've seen it all before...  
Bring it on, cause I'm no victim  
Dying (away, away)  
Dying (away, away)  
Dying  
Dying...

I'm sick and tired of hearing things,  
From uptight, short sighted, narrow minded hypocrites,  
All I want is the truth,  
Just gimme some truth,  
I've had enough of reading things,  
By neurotic, psychotic, pig headed politicians,  
All I want is the truth,  
Just give us the truth,  
  
No short haired, yellow bellied, son of George Porgy is  
Gonna mother hubbard, soft soap me with just a pocket full of oil,  
Money for oil,  
Money for oil.  
  
I'm sick to death of seeing things,  
By tight lipped, condescending, mommy's little chauvinists,  
All I want is the truth,  
Just gimme some truth,  
I've had enough of watching scenes,  
Of schizophrenic, egocentric, paranoia prima donnas,  
All I want is the truth,  
Just give us the truth,  
  
No short haired, yellow bellied, son of tricky Dicky is  
Gonna mother hubbard soft soap me with just a pocket full of oil,  
Money for oil,  
Money for oil,  
  
No short haired, yellow bellied, son of George-Porgy is  
Gonna mother hubbard soft soap me with just a pocket full of oil,  
It's money for oil,  
No blood for oil,  
  
I'm sick to death of hearing things,  
From uptight, short sighted, narrow minded hypocrites,  
All I want is the truth,  
Just gimme some truth,  
I've had enough of reading things,  
By neurotic psychotic, homophobic hypocrites,  
All I want is the truth,  
Just give us the truth,  
All we want is the truth,  
Just give us the truth,  
We can handle the truth,  
Just give us some truth,  
Share with us the truth,  
We'll give you our truth

He could've tuned in tuned in  
But he tuned out  
A bad time nothing could save him  
Alone in a corridor waiting locked out  
He got up outta there ran for hundreds of miles  
He made it to the ocean had a smoke in a tree  
The wind rose up set him down on his knee  
  
A wave came crashing like a fist to the jaw  
Delivered him wings "Hey look at me now"  
Arms wide open with the sea as his floor  
Oh power oh  
  
He's flying  
Whole  
High wide, oh  
  
He floated back down 'cause he wanted to share  
His key to the locks on the chains he saw everywhere  
But first he was stripped and then he was stabbed  
By faceless men, well, fuckers  
He still stands  
  
And he still gives his love, he just gives it away  
The love he receives is the love that is saved  
And sometimes is seen a strange spot in the sky  
A human being that was given to fly  
  
High flying  
Oh, oh  
High flying  
Oh, oh  
He's flying  
Oh, oh

Oh please don't go out on me don't go out on me now  
Never acted up before don't go on me now  
I swear I never took it for granted just thought of it now  
Suppose I abused you just passing it on  
Go, fuck  
  
Once fastened servile now your getting sharp  
Moving oh so swiftly with such disarm  
I pulled the covers over him shoulda' pulled the alarm  
Turned to my nemesis a fool no fucking god  
No, time, suck, my, please,  
Don't go on me  
Please  
  
Suck, blood, touch, please, tunnel vision, tuck, time, see,  
Please, please, please,  
Don't go on me  
  
Please, Don't you want me, don't go on me,  
Please, don't go on me

Recorded by Fleetwood Mac.  
Loving you  
Isn't the right thing to do  
How can I ever change things  
That I feel  
If I could  
Maybe I'd give you my world  
How can I  
When you won't take it from me  
You can go your own way  
Go your own way  
You can call it  
Another lonely day  
You can go your own way  
Go your own way  
Tell me why  
Everything turned around  
Packing up  
Shacking up is all you wanna do  
If I could  
Baby I'd give you my world  
Open up  
Everything's waiting for you  
You can go your own way  
Go your own way  
You can call it  
Another lonely day  
You can go your own way  
go your own way  
(Instrumental solo)  
You can go your own way  
Go your own way  
You can call it another lonely day  
Another lonely day  
You can go your own way  
Go your own way  
You can call it another lonely day  
(Instrumental solo)  
You can go your own way  
You can call it another lonely day  
You can go your own way  
You can call it... (fade out)

No more upset mornings  
No more trying evenings  
It's the American Dream I am disbelieving.  
  
When the gas in my tank feels like money in the bank  
I'm gonna blow it all this time, take me one last ride.  
  
The lights of the city, they only look good when I'm speeding  
I wanna leave em all behind me because this time I'm gone  
Gone, going for it all this time, gone.  
  
In the far off distance  
As my taillights fade  
No one to witness but they will someday  
  
Feel like a question is forming  
And the answers  
I will be what I could be  
Once I get out of this town.  
  
The lights of this city  
They've lost all of their feeling  
I wanna leave em all behind me because this time I'm gone  
Gone, going for it all, this time I'm gone  
  
Nothing is everything  
I'll have it all  
If nothing is everything then I will have it all.  
I'm gone.

Do you want to hear something sad?  
We are but victims of desire  
I'm gonna shake this day  
I wanna shake this day before I retire  
  
I'm gonna see my friend  
I'm gonna see my friend, make it go away  
I'm sick of everything  
I'm gonna see my friend, make it go away  
  
Bueno sera, I won't be long before we all walk off the wire  
Well I'm gonna see my friend, I'm gonna see my friend for what I require  
Bueno sera I will come in quick  
Don't want my flame to get no higher  
  
I'm gonna see my friend  
I'm gonna see my friend, make it go away  
I'm sick of everything  
I'm gonna see my friend, make it go away  
I'm gonna see my friend  
Gonna see my friend, make it go away  
  
Want to leave it all.  
Want to give it up.  
Want to see it go once and for all  
Want to view it cho'  
Want a little bit home  
Want to be there  
  
Hard as a statue, black as a tattoo, ?  
Gonna take me an astral plane  
I'm gonna tunnel through denial  
But I'm gonna shake this day  
I wanna shake this day before I retire  
  
I'm gonna see my friend  
I'm gonna see my friend, make it go away  
I'm sick of everything  
I'm gonna see my friend, make it go away  
I'm gonna see my friend  
I'm gonna see my friend, make it go away

I got some if you need it  
Carry on, let's go

(G-are-E-E-D)  
It's a disease and they're all green  
It emanates from their being  
A satiation with occupation  
And like weeds with big leaves  
Stealing light from what's beneath  
Where they have more  
Still they take more  
I know, then I don't  
There's a stow-away with my throat  
It's deceiving, I don't believe him  
We can scream out our doors  
Behind the wall, a fat man snores  
In his dreams, he's choking ti leaves  
Well I guess there's nothing wrong with what you say  
But don't sell me, "there can't be better ways"  
Tell the captain, "the boat's not safe, and we're drowning"  
Turns out he's the one making waves, waves, waves...  
I said there's nothing wrong with what you say  
Believe me, I'm just asking you to sway  
No white or black, just grey  
Can you feel this world with your heart and not your brain?  
Brain...

Every beach has a clown who thinks he knows it all (hang-ten outta santa fe
when surf comes out tomorrow lets go)  
And he's always practicing his cowabunga call (cowabunga)  
But he'll never scramble when the big waves start to roll  
Cause there's nothing worse than a gremmie out of control  
Gremmie out of control  
Gremmie out of control  
There's nothing worse than a gremmie out of control  
The kids always know that gremmie's talk is cheap (ride the hula-han over the
pipeline bonsai to the saddle bowl)  
Oh they just try to ignore this ugly creep (cowabunga)  
His board is always full of dings  
Cause he's always doing stupid things  
And there's nothing worse than a gremmie out of control  
Gremmie out of control  
Gremmie out of control  
There's nothing worse than a gremmie out of control  
Gremmie out of control  
Gremmie out of control  
There's nothing worse than a gremmie out of control  
There's nothing worse than a gremmie out of control  
There's nothing worse than a gremmie out of control

Have a drink they're buying,  
Bottom of, bottle of denial,  
  
Big guy, big eye, watching me,  
Have to wonder what it sees,  
Progress, laced with, ramifications,  
Freedom's big plunge.  
  
Pull the innocent from a crowd,  
Raise the sticks then bring 'em down ,  
If they fail to obey,  
If they fail to obey.  
  
For every tool they lend us, a loss of independence.  
  
I pledge to my grievance to the flag,  
Cause you don't give blood, then take it back again,  
We're deserving of much more.  
  
Progress, taste it, invest-it-all,  
Champagne breakfast for everyone.  
  
Break the innocent when they're proud,  
Raise the stakes, then bring 'em down,  
If they fail to obey,  
If they fail to obey.  
  
Pledge my grievance to the flag,  
Aw come on, don't give blood, then take it back again,  
We're all deserving something more.  
  
I want to breathe, part of the seen,  
I want to taste, everyone I see,  
I want to run, when I'm up high,  
I want to run to the sea,  
I only want life to be,  
I just want to be,  
I will feel alive as long as I am free.

See it happen to a couple of friends  
See it happen and the message it sends  
Taking off for what's an obvious fall  
Just to see what all the fuss is about  
It's not your way...not your way...  
It's not your way...yeah...  
Another habit sentence him up with you  
Another habit says he's long overdue  
Another habit like an unwanted friend  
I'm so happy with my righteous self...  
It's not your way...not your way...  
It's not your way...  
Never thought you'd habit... (3x)  
I never thought you, never thought you...  
Never thought you'd habit... (3x)  
I never thought you, never, never thought you...  
Never thought you'd habit... (6x)  
Speaking as a child of the nineties...  
Never thought you'd habit... (3x)  
I never thought you, never thought you...  
Never thought you'd habit... (3x)  
I never thought you, never, never thought you...  
Never...never me...never you...never me...

Ah is there room for both of us? Both of us apart?  
Are we bound out of obligation? Is that all we've got?  
I get the words and then I get to thinkin'  
But I don't want to think I want to feel!  
How do I feel? And how do I...  
If you're the only one well I'll never be enough yeah...  
Hail hail the lucky ones I refer to those in love yeah...  
A how I love you till the day I die...ah and beyond...  
Are we going to the same place? If so, can I come?  
It's egg rollin' thick and heavy...all the past we carry...  
Oh, I could be new...you underestimate me...  
If you're the only one, well I'll never be enough, yeah...  
Hail, hail the lucky ones, I refer to those in love, yeah...  
I sometimes realize...I could only be as good as you'll let me...  
Are you woman enough to be my man? Bandaged hand in hand...  
Yeah...  
I find it on my run in a race that can't be won, yeah...  
All hail the lucky ones, I refer to those in love, yeah...  
If you're my only one...so good, you only one...  
I want to be your one...enough, you won...your one...your hun...

E per noi un piacere augurarvi insieme  
Ai are. E. M. Un buon cetriolo  
(It is a pleasure for us to wish you, together  
With are. E. M., a merry cucumber)  
I need a song to help along  
When it feels wrong it seems so long  
To get to the light  
We live in homes talk on phones  
Hear the tones can you hold  
Moving fast as light tv's on at night  
Does peace come out of fighting  
Can truths come out of lying  
I'm happy when I'm crying  
If reality is what I see newspapers mag-azines tv  
Tell's what's going on leading us along  
It's not absurd to all get heard  
Put our feelings into words  
You have to reach inside no feelings to hide  
Does peace from out of fighting  
Can truth come out of lying  
I'm happy when I'm crying  
Bring children into the world  
We couldn't have done it by ourselves  
Stop and wonder why  
There's more than meets the eye  
Somewhere inside I did believe  
I can't belong I was wrong  
I have gained insight  
I will see the light  
Truth isn't lying  
Peace isn't fighting  
Love isn't dying

Tell me what I want to hear  
This shit's too good to be true, my dear  
Tell me lies, tell me lies, tell me  
Tell me lies, tell me  
Help me, help me, help me  
Help me, help me, help me  
Storybook keeps from hurting me, you see  
Shell of the man from the sea  
Tell me lies, tell me lies, tell me  
Tell me lies, tell me  
Tell me why, tell me why, tell me  
Tell me why, tell me  
Tell me lies, tell me lies, tell me  
Tell me lies, tell me  
Help me, help me, help me  
Help me, help me, help me  
Reservoir of hate and fear  
Invisible, in repair  
A hundred thieves cast a spell  
This is hell  
Help me, help me, help me  
Help me, help me, help me  
The man they call my enemy, I've seen his eyes  
He looks just like me, a mirror  
The more you read, we've been deceived  
Everyday it becomes clearer  
Clearer, clearer, clearer, clearer...  
Not my enemy  
No, not my enemy  
Don't speak for me  
No, not my enemy

History never repeats  
I tell myself before I go to sleep...  
Don't say the words you might regret  
I lost before,you know I can't forget...  
There was a girl I used to know...  
Well,she dealt my love a savage blow...  
And I was so young,too blind to see...  
But anyway,that's history...  
And I say,history never repeats  
I tell myself before I go to sleep...  
And there's a light shining in the dark  
Leading me on towards a change of heart...  
You say I always play the fool...  
I can't go on if that's the rule...  
Better to jump than hesitate...  
I need a change and I can't wait...  
I say...history never repeats  
I tell myself before I go to sleep...  
And there's a light shining in the dark  
Leading me on towards a change of heart...heart...  
Never repeats...whoa...  
History never repeats  
History never re...  
Deep in the night it's all so clear...  
I lie awake with great ideas...  
Lurking about in no man's land...  
I think at last I understand...  
History never repeats  
I tell myself before I go to sleep...  
And there's a light shining in the dark  
Leading me on towards a change of heart...  
Yeah!

I don't mind  
Stealing Bread  
From the mouths of decadence  
  
But I can't feed on the powerless  
When my cup's already overfilled  
But it's on the table,  
The fire's cooking  
And they're starving babies,  
And the slaves are all working  
  
Blood is on the table,  
The mouths are choking  
  
I'm going hungry  
  
I don't mind  
Stealing Bread  
From the mouths of decadence  
  
But I can't feed on the powerless  
When my cup's already overfilled  
But it's on the table,  
The fire's cooking  
And they're starving babies,  
And the slaves are all working  
  
And it's on the table,  
The mouths are choking  
  
I'm going hungry

And the rivers shall open for the righteous  
And the rivers shall open for the righteous  
And the rivers shall open for the righteous, someday  
  
I went walking, with my brother  
And he wondered, oh, how I am  
Said what I believe with my soul  
Ain't what I see with my eyes  
And there's no turning back this time  
I am a patriot, and I love my country  
Because my country is all I know  
I want to be with my family  
People who understand me  
I got no place else to go...  
I am a patriot...  
  
I was walking with my girlfriend.  
She looked so fine, I said  
"Baby, what's on your mind?"  
Said I want to run like the lions  
Released from their cages...  
Released from the rages  
Burning in my soul tonight.  
  
I am a patriot, and I love my country  
Because my country is all I know  
  
And I ain't no communist,  
And I ain't no socialist,  
And I ain't no capitalist,  
And I ain't no imperialist,  
And I ain't no democrat,  
Sure ain't no republican either,  
I only know one party,  
And that is Freedom.  
I am... I am... I am...  
  
I am a patriot, and I love my country,  
Because my country is all I know.  
  
And the rivers shall open for the righteous,  
And the rivers shall open for the righteous,  
And the rivers shall open for the righteous Someday...  
Someday... Someday...

The selfish, they're all standing in line  
Faithing and hoping to buy themselves time  
Me, I figure as each breath goes by  
I only own my mind  
  
The North is to South what the clock is to time  
There's east and there's west and there's everywhere lying  
I know I was born and I know that I'll die  
The in between is mine  
I am mine  
  
And the feeling it gets left behind  
All the innocence lost at one time  
Significant behind the eyes  
There's no need to hide...  
We're safe tonight  
  
The ocean is full 'cause everyone's crying  
The full moon is looking for friends at high tide  
The sorrow grows bigger when the sorrow's denied  
I only know my mind  
I am mine  
  
And the meaning, it gets left behind  
All the innocents lost at one time  
Significant behind the eyes  
There's no need to hide...  
We're safe tonight  
  
And the feelings that get left behind  
All the innocents broken with lies  
Significance, between the lines  
(We may need to hide)  
  
And the meanings that get left behind  
All the innocents lost at one time  
Significance, between the linesThere's no need to hide

I used to be on an endless run  
Believed in miracles 'cause I'm one  
I've been blessed with the power to survive  
After all these years I'm still alive  
  
I'm out here kickin with the band  
I am no longer a solitary man  
Everyday my time runs out  
Live like a fool, that's what I was about  
  
Oh I belive in miracles  
I believe in a better world for me and you  
Oh Oh I believe in miracles  
I believe in a better world for me and you  
  
Tattooed your name on my arm  
I always said my girl's a good luck charm  
If she can find a reason to forgive  
Then I can find a reason to live  
  
I used to be on an endless run  
Believed in miracles 'cause I'm one  
I've been blessed with the power to survive  
After all these years I'm still alive  
  
Oh I believe in miracles  
I believe in a better world for me and you  
Oh Oh I believe in miracles  
I believe in a better world for me and you  
  
I close my eyes and think how it might be  
The future's here today  
It's not too late, it's not too late oh  
  
I believe in miracles  
I believe in a better world for me and you  
Oh I believe in miracles  
I believe in a better world for me and you

My lips are shakin', my nails are bit off. Been a month since I heard myself
talk.  
All the advantage this life's got on me.. Picture a cup in the middle of the
sea.  
And I fight back in my mind.  
Never let's be right.  
I got memories I got shit.  
So much it don't show.  
  
  
I walked in light, when you held me in that night.  
I walked the line, when you held my hand that night.  
  
  
An empty shell seems so easy to crack.  
Got all these questions don't know who I could even ask.  
So I'll just lie alone and wait for the dream, where I'm not ugly and you're
lookin' at me.  
And I stay in bed, all blue I've seen hell.  
If just once I could feel love, stare back at me.  
But I walked in light, when you held me in that night.  
I walked the line, when you held my hand that night.  
I walked in light, when you held me close that night.  
I paid the price never held you in real life...  
my lips are shakin'...

No, I won't back down  
No, I won't back down  
You can stand me up at the gates of Hell, but I won't back down  
  
I will stand my ground, won't be turned around  
I will keep my world from draggin' me down, I won't back down  
No, I won't back down  
  
Hey, baby, there ain't no easy way out  
Hey, I will stand my ground  
No, I won't back down  
  
Oh, I know what's right, I got just one life  
I will keep this world from pushin' me around, I'll stand my ground  
No, I won't back down  
  
Hey, baby, there ain't no easy way out  
Hey, I will stand my ground  
Hey, I will stand my ground  
And I won't back down  
  
And I won't back down, no I won't back down

Vacate is the word...vengeance has no place so near to her  
Cannot find the comfort in this world  
Artificial tear...vessel stabbed...next up volunteers  
Vulnerable wisdom can't adhere...  
A truant finds home...and I wish to hold on...  
But there's a trapdoor in the sun...immortality...  
As privileged as a whore...victims in demand for public show  
Swept out through the cracks beneath the door  
Holier than thou how?  
Surrendered...executed anyhow  
Scrawl dissolved, cigar box on the floor...  
A truant finds home...and I wish to hold on, too...  
But saw the trapdoor in the sun...  
Immortality...  
I cannot stop the thought...I'm running in the dark...  
Coming up a which way sign...all good truants must decide...  
Oh, stripped and sold, mom...auctioned forearm...  
And whiskers in the sink...  
Truants move on...cannot stay long  
Some die just to live...  
Ohh...

Up here in my tree yeah...  
Newspapers meant enough to me yeah...no...  
No more crowbars to my head yeah...  
I'm trading stories with the leaves instead yeah...  
Wave to all my friends yeah...  
They don't seem to notice me no...  
All their eyes trained on the street yo oh...  
Sidewalk cigarettes and scenes yeah...yeah...  
Up here so high I start to escape  
Up here so high the sky I scrape  
I'm so high I hold just one breath here within my chest  
Just like innocence...  
I remember him, yeah...  
I swore I knew everything, oh yeah...  
They say knowledge is a dream, yeah...  
He's growing up just like me, yeah...  
I'm so light, the wind he shakes  
I'm so high, the sky I scrape, yeah...  
I'm so light I hold just one breath and go back to my nest  
Sleep with innocence...  
Up here so high, the bars they break...  
Up here so high, the sky I scrape...  
Had my eyes peeled both wide open, and I got a glimpse...  
Of my innocence...got back my innocence...  
Baby, got it...still got it...

In the moonlight  
Gettin', why I ought to get back  
It's a, this day is sure to relapse  
It's getting closer to up-ends  
  
In the moonlight  
Given two lost wings  
A beautiful star, I see  
A wonderful sense of feeling  
  
In the moonlight  
Feel, it's a love draw nearer  
Darkened days, I spent in  
A night bird is following you all the time  
  
Under a star-lined ceiling  
In darkness, I see  
All your senses revealed  
In the moonlight  
  
It's, it's the love draw nearer  
Darkened days, I spent in  
A night bird is following you all the time  
It's a love draw nearer  
  
Darkened days, I spent in  
A night bird is following you  
Is following you  
A night bird is following you all the time

Keep on locking your doors  
Keep on building your floors  
Keep on just as before  
Pay disasters no mind  
Didn't get you this time  
No prints left at the crime  
  
Our ship's come in and it's sinking  
  
Of everything that's possible  
In the hearts and minds of man  
Somehow it is the biggest things  
that keep on slipping right through our hands  
  
By thinking we're infallible  
Oh we are tempting fate instead  
Ah, time we best begin here at the end, end  
  
Wanna third second chance  
Put your faith in big hands  
Pay no more than a glance  
All good things come to an end  
This could be good as it gets  
How's the view from the fence?  
  
You think we've been here before  
You are mistaken  
  
Of everything that's possible  
In the hearts and minds of man  
When progress could be plausible  
In reverse we curse ourselves yeah  
  
Oh yeah by thinking we're infallible  
Oh we are tempting fate instead uh uh uh  
Time we best begin here at the end, end  
  
Of everything that's possible  
In the hearts and minds of man  
Ye yeah somehow it is the biggest things  
That keep on slipping right through our hands  
  
Hey by thinking we're infallible  
Oh, we are tempting fate instead  
Oh yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah  
Oh yeah  
Yeah  
  
Oh time we best begin  
Here at the end, end  
Here at the end, end  
  
Keep on locking your doors  
Keep on building your floors  
Keep on just as before

All in all, it's no one's fault,  
Excuses turn to carbon walls,  
Blame it all on chemical intercourse.  
  
The swallowed seeds of arrogance,  
Breeding in the thoughts of ten-  
Thousand fools that fight irrelevance.  
  
The full moon is dead skin,  
The one down here's wearing thin,  
So set up the ten pins,  
As the human tide rolls in,  
Like a ball that's spinning.  
  
Bombs, dropping down,  
Overhead, underground,  
It's instilled, to want to live.  
  
Bombs, dropping down,  
Please forgive, our hometown,  
In our insignificance.  
  
Turn the jukebox up, he said,  
Dancing in irreverence,  
Play V3, let the song protest.  
  
The plates began to shift,  
Perfect lefts come rolling in,  
I was alone and far away, hey,  
When I heard the band start playing,  
On the lip, late take off.  
  
Bombs, dropping down,  
Overhead, underground,  
It's instilled to want to live.  
  
Bombs dropping down,  
Please forgive, our hometown,  
In our insignificance.  
  
Feel like resonance of distance,  
In the blood the iron lies.  
  
It's instilled to want to live.  
  
Bombs dropping down,  
Please forgive our hometown,  
In our insignificance,  
Oh, in our insignificance, oh.

It's okay, it's okay (x4)  
You don't have to run and hide away  
It's okay, it's okay  
I love you anyway  
It's okay, it's okay  
You don't need to run and hide away  
It's okay, it's okay  
This is my life, this is my chance  
This is my hope in an alleyway  
This is my choice, this is my voice  
There may be no tomorrow, now  
This is my plea, this is my need  
This is my day to be free  
This is my time, this is my way  
In a world that's never safe  
It's okay, it's okay  
You gotta let me run away  
It's okay, it's okay  
Oh now let me run away  
It's okay, it's okay  
You're gonna run and hide away  
It's okay, it's okay

(Fleetwood Mac cover)  
(taken from, Live 1995)  
I took my love, and I took it down  
I Climbed a mountain and I turned around  
And I saw my reflection in the snow covered hills  
'Till the landslide brought me down  
Oh, mirror in the sky  
What is love?  
Can the child within my heart rise above  
Can I sail thru the changing ocean tides  
Can I handle the seasons of my life  
Uh-uh I don't know  
Uh-uh  
Well, I've been afraid of changing  
'Cause I've built my life around you  
But time makes you bolder  
Children get older  
I'm getting older too  
S0o0o0  
(Gutiar solo)  
I've been afraid of changing  
'Cause I built my life around you  
But time makes you bolder  
Children get older  
I'm getting older too  
I'm getting older too  
Oh, take this love, take it down  
Oh, If you Climb a mountain and turn around  
If you see my reflection in the snow covered hills  
Well the landslide will bring it down down  
And If you see my reflection in the snow covered hills  
Well maybe the landslide will bring it down  
Well well the landslide will bring it down

Lives opened and trashed..."Look ma, watch me crash..."  
No time to question...why'd nothing last...  
Grasp and hold on...hold tight and fast...  
Soon be over...and I will relent...  
Let the ocean swell dissolve 'way my past  
Three days and maybe longer won't even know I've left  
Under your tongue...I'm like a tab...  
I will give you what...you're not supposed to have...  
Under my breath...I swear by sin...  
For better or for worse...a best we began...  
Let the sun climb, oh, burn away my mask  
Three days, and maybe longer, shed my skin at last...shed...shed...  
Let the sun shine, burn away my mask  
Three days, and maybe longer, won't ever find me here  
Let the ocean dissolve away my past  
Four days, and not much longer...  
Let my spirit pass...  
Ooh...  
This is, this is...(3x)  
My...last exit

Oh, where oh where can my baby be?  
The Lord took her away from me  
She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good  
So I can see my baby when I leave this world.  
  
We were out on a date in my daddy's car  
We hadn't driven very far  
There in the road, up straight ahead  
A car was stalled, the engine was dead  
I couldn't stop, so I swerved to the right  
I'll never forget the sound that night  
The screaming tires, the busting glass  
The painful scream that I heard last.  
  
Oh, where oh where can my baby be?  
The Lord took her away from me  
She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good  
So I can see my baby when I leave this world.  
  
When I woke up, the rain was falling down  
There were people standing all around  
Something warm flowing through my eyes  
But somehow I found my baby that night  
I lifted her head, she looked at me and said  
"Hold me darling just a little while."  
I held her close, I kissed her our last kiss  
I found the love that I knew I had missed  
But now she's gone, even though I hold her tight  
I lost my love, my life that night.  
  
Oh, where oh where can my baby be?  
The Lord took her away from me  
She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good  
So I can see my baby when I leave this world.  
Oh, oh

Troubled souls unite we got ourselves tonight  
I am fuel you are friends we got the means to make amends  
I am lost I'm no guide but I'm by your side  
I am right by your side  
  
Young lover I stand  
It was their idea I proved to be a man  
Take my fucking hand  
It was their idea I proved to be a man  
Will myself to find a home a home within myself  
We will find a way we will find our place  
  
Drop the leash drop the leash  
Get outta' my fuckin' face  
  
Drop the leash, we are young  
Oh, get outta' my fuckin' face  
Drop the leash, drop the leash  
Get outta' my, my  
  
Delight, delight, delight in our youth  
Get outta' my fuckin' face

I read about a man to whom I may be related  
Leatherman  
Died a long time ago, in the 1880s  
Leatherman, Leatherman  
  
Covered with leather but it wasn't tight  
Underneath the moon in the woods at night  
  
Making the rounds, ten miles a day  
Once a month they spot him  
Here's what they say:  
  
"Here he comes, he's a man of the land  
He's Leatherman  
Smile on his face  
Axe in his pack  
He's Leatherman, Leatherman, Leatherman."  
  
Comes out of the caves once a day to be fed  
He wasn't known to say much  
But, "Thanks for the bread."  
  
So modern day I walk my way, my jacket faded  
Just like a man of leather to whom I may be related  
  
Rolled a cigarette for which he asked for a light  
Appeared to be an animal, yet so polite  
  
Making the rounds, ten miles a day  
Once a month they spot him  
Here's what they say:  
  
"Here he comes, he's a man of the land  
He's Leatherman  
Smile on his face  
Axe in his pack  
He's Leatherman, Leatherman, Leatherman  
He's Leatherman, Leatherman."  
  
Shakes his head, he's Leatherman  
Bake some bread, he's Leatherman  
Shame he's dead  
I saw his bed  
It's all that's left of Leatherman  
Leatherman  
Give me some skin, Leatherman.

We had this bright idea one late summer night  
Candy-coated popcorn strung like a beaded curtain hung over your door  
I guess the heat got to it, dripped and melted all over the floor  
Chocolate-covered cherries in tin foil boats float around the floorboard  
I had to laugh not to cry  
Now all your possessions, all of your things, all of your hopes, schemes,
desires, and most of all, your dreams  
All gone away... Gone away...  
All gone away... Gone away...  
All gone away  
"live for today", you said, "live for today"  
I had to laugh not to cry  
I had to laugh not to cry, not to cry...

And I wished for so long. Cannot stay.  
All the precious moments. Cannot stay.  
It's not like wings have fallen. Cannot stay.  
But still something's missing. I cannot say, yeah.  
Holding hands are daughters and sons.  
And their faiths are falling down, down, down, down.  
I have wished for so long. How I wish for you today.  
Will I walk the long road? (the long road) Cannot stay. (the long road)  
There's no need to say goodbye. (to say goodbye)  
All the friends and family.  
All the memories going round, round, round, round.  
I have wished for so long. How I wish for you today.  
And the wind keeps roaring. And the sky keeps turning grey.  
And the sun is set. The sun will rise another day.  
I...  
I have wished for so long. How I wish for you today.  
I have wished for so long. How I wish for you today.  
Will I walk the long road? We all walk the long road.  
Will I walk the long road. We all walk the long road.  
Will I walk the long road?  
Will I walk the long road? We all walk the long road.  
Will I walk the long road? We all walk the long road.  
Will I walk the long road?  
  

Is this just another day, this God forgotten place?  
First comes love, then comes pain. Let the games begin,  
Questions rise and answers fall, insurmountable.  
  
Love boat captain  
Take the reigns and steer us towards the clear, here.  
It's already been sung, but it can't be said enough.  
All you need is love  
  
Is this just another phase? earthquakes making waves,  
Trying to shake the cancer off? stupid human beings,  
Once you hold the hand of love, it's all surmountable.  
  
Hold me, and make it the truth,  
That when all is lost there will be you,  
Cause to the universe I don't mean a thing  
And there's just one word I still believe  
And it's  
  
It's an art to live with pain, mix the light into grey,  
Lost nine friends we'll never know, two years ago today  
And if our lives became too long, would it add to our regret?  
  
And the young, they can lose hope cause they can't see beyond today,  
The wisdom that the old can't give away  
Hey,  
Constant recoil  
Sometimes life  
Don't leave you alone.  
  
Hold me, and make it the truth,  
That when all is lost there will be you.  
Cause to the universe I don't mean a thing  
And there's just one word that I still believe and it's  
Love, love. Love. Love. Love.  
  
Love boat captain  
Take the reigns, steer us towards the clear.  
I know it's already been sung, can't be said enough.  
Love is all you need, all you need is love,  
Love, love,  
Love.

Clouds roll by  
Reeling is what they say  
Or is it just my way?  
  
Wind blows by low light  
Side tracked low light  
Can't see my tracks your scent way back  
  
Can I be here all alone?  
Clear a path to my home  
Blood runs dry  
Books and jealousy tell me wrong  
All I feel calm  
Voice blows by low light  
Car crash low light  
Can't wear my mask your first my last  
  
Voice goes by  
Two birds is what they'll see  
Getting lost upon their way  
Wind rolls by, low light  
Eye sight, low light  
I need the light  
I'll find my way from wrong, what's real?  
The dream I see

Drive down the street can't find the keys to my own fucking home  
I take a walk so I can curse my ass for being dumb  
I make a right after the arches stinking grease and bone  
Stop at the supermarket people stare like I'm a dog  
I've been goin' to Lukin's...I gotta spot that Lukin's...  
I knocked the door at Lukin's...opened the fridge...  
Now I know life is worth...  
I find the key but I return to find an open door  
So fucking freezin', they jump out the car, everybody wants some  
I find my wife, I call the cops, this day's work's never done  
The last I heard that freak was purchasing a fucking gun

You'll be...going out with radio...  
Going out with disco...going out like bacchanal...  
I'll be...going out with telephone...  
Going out alone...to the radar zone...  
It's all just inadvertent imitation and I don't mean mine  
It's all across this nation...  
If it's just inadvertent simulation a pattern in all mankind  
What's got the whole world fakin' it?  
I'll be...playing with my magazine...  
Using up my Listerine...Like Ovaltine...  
And you'll be...you're dippin' in your battleship...  
For the latest tip...for the latest dream...  
It's all just inadvertent, imitation, and I don't mean mine  
It's all across this nation...  
If it's just inadvertent, simulation, a pattern in all mankind  
What's got the whole world fakin' it?  
If it's just inadvertent, imitation, a pattern in all mankind  
What's got the whole world fakin' it?  
What's got the whole world fakin'? (4x)  
What's got the whole world fakin' it, yeah?

There is a marker  
No one sees it 'cause the sand  
Has covered over all the messages it kept  
Misunderstanding, what original truth was  
And out expanding, in a faith, but not in love  
  
What went wrong?  
  
Walking tightrope high over moral ground  
Seeing visions of falling up somehow  
Do come down  
  
With the living let what is living love  
So unforgiving, yet needing forgiveness first  
  
God, what do you say?  
  
Those undecided needn't have faith to be free  
And those misguided, there was a plan for them to be  
Now you got both sides claiming killing in god's name  
But god is nowhere to be found, conveniently  
  
What goes on?  
  
Walking tightrope high over moral ground  
Walk the bridges before you burn them down  
Do come round  
  
With the living let what is living love  
Unforgiving, yet needing forgiveness first  
  
God, what do you say? What do you say?  
  
I feel a sickness. A sickness coming over me  
Like watching freedom being sucked straight out to sea  
And the solution? Well, from me far would it be  
But the delusion is feeling dangerous to me  
  
What goes wrong?  
  
Walking tightrope high over moral ground  
Seeing visions of falling up somehow  
Do come down  
  
With the living, let what is living love  
Are forgiving, yet needing forgiveness first  
  
What do you say? God, what do you say?  
What do you say?  
  
Calling out, calling out  
Calling out, calling out

Come you masters of war  
You that build all the guns  
You that build the death planes  
You that build all the bombs  
You that hide behind walls  
You that hide behind desks  
We just want you to know we can see through your masks  
You that never done nothing  
But build and destroy  
You play with our world  
Like it's your little toy  
You put a gun in my head  
And then you hide from my eyes  
Then you turn and run following the fast foolish line  
Like Judas of old  
You lie and deceive  
A world war can be won  
You won't need to believe  
But I see through your eye  
And I see through your brain  
Like I see through the water that runs down my drain  
You that fasten all the trigger  
For the others to fire  
And you sit back and watch  
While the death toll gets higher  
You hide in your mansion  
While young people's blood  
Flows out of their bodies and is buried in the mud  
You've thrown the worst fear  
That could ever be hurled  
The fear to bring children  
Into this world  
For threatening my baby  
Unborn and unnamed  
You ain't worth the blood that runs through your veins  
How much do we know  
To talk out of turn?  
You might say that we're young  
You might say we're unlearned  
But there's one thing I know  
Though I'm younger than you  
Even Jesus would never forgive what you do  
Let me ask you one question  
Is your money that good?  
Will it buy you forgiveness?  
Do you think that it would?  
Oh, I think you will find  
When your death takes its toll  
All the money you made will never buy back your soul  
And I hope that you die  
And your death will come soon  
I'll stand on your [Incomprehensible]  
In the pale afternoon  
And I'll watch while you're lowered  
Into your deathbed  
And I'll stand on your grave till I'm sure that you're dead  

Free the people, oh... Got your love, whoa... (X2)  
  
Shower the people you love with love  
Show them the way that you feel  
(X2)  
  
I'm special... 'cause I'm gonna make you see  
Nobody loves you, nobody like me  
I'm special, so special  
I got to have some of your attention, give it to me  
'Cause I'm...  
I'll kick the fuck out of you  
  
Peaceful times have come and gone  
It's time to fuckin' kill somebody  
I try, don't blame me  
I try, peacefully  
That time has come and gone, now it's just me  
Just me... This means nothin' no more  
This don't mean nothin' no more  
I don't want to see this no more  
Unless you're ready, 'less you're ready, to stand behind it...  
I don't give a fuck  
Let the words that you say to me  
Unless the actions sustain it  
It's meaningless...  
We're all meaningless  
  
The world will go on  
And we're all meaningless  
The world will spin  
We're all meaningless  
I refuse, I refuse, to believe  
We're meaningless, meaningless  
We're meaningless, I refuse...  
I won't give up, yeah...  
Meaningless... We're not meaningless  
We're not invisible... We're not meaningless  
If you love someone, tell 'em  
Show them the way that you feel  
Shower the people you love with love  
Show them the way that you feel (X3)  
Oh...

Sliding out of reverse into drive.  
This wheel will be turning right, then straight.  
Off in the sunset she'll ride.  
  
She can remember a time, denied.  
Stood by the side of the road.  
Spilled like wine now.  
She's out on her own and line high.  
  
There's no leaving here.  
Ask I'm an ear.  
She's disappeared now.  
  
They said that timing was everything.  
Made him want to be everywhere.  
There's a lot to be said for nowhere.  
  
There's no leaving here.  
Ask I'm an ear.  
He's disappeared now.  
There's no leaving here.  
Ask I'm an ear.  
Fuck it. We'll disappear now.

I've got an unfortunate feelin', I've been beaten down  
I feel I don't believe and now the truth is coming out  
What they've taken is more than a vow  
They've taken your innocence and then they throw them on a burning fire  
  
All along they're sayin' mind your manners  
  
I caught myself believin' that I needed God  
And if it's hard for some we sure could use it now  
  
Try my patience, my patience tried  
This world's no longer good enough that makes me wanna cry  
  
All along they're sayin' mind your manners  
  
Silence save him  
  
Self-realized and metaphysically redeemed  
May not live another life  
May not solve a mystery  
Right around the corner  
Could be bigger than ourselves  
We could will it to the sky  
Or we could something else  
  
No longer sayin' mind your manners  
Always burning  
  
Self-realized and metaphysically redeemed  
May not live another life  
May not solve a mystery  
Right around the corner  
Could be bigger than ourselves  
We could will it to the sky  
Or we could something else  
  
Go to Heaven  
That's swell  
How do you like it  
Livin' Hell  
Go to Heaven  
That's swell  
How do you like it  
Livin' Hell  
Go to Heaven  
That's swell  
How do you like it  
Livin' Hell  
  
Livin' Hell!

And out isn't perfect  
My friends I'll say it too  
Stay my case of which I'm certain  
I've lived a life as full  
I've traveled each and every highway  
Oh and more as more gets  
I did it my way  
Regrets I've had a few  
But they're too few to mention  
I did what I had  
It's all through without exemption  
I play each charted course  
I've traveled each and every byway  
And more much more than this  
I did it my way  
Well twice I'm sure you knew  
When I bit off more than I could chew  
I knew it all without a doubt  
I ate it up and I had to spit it out  
I passed it on and I stood tall  
And I did it my way

Ten Demo)  
Yes, it's true... Shining wine...  
Go on leave with the morning light  
My love, on the wing at night she rides  
Fade away where the sun cleared out  
Yeah... Fade away...  
Little time in this life... Sometime it seems...  
Twilight world, dark, living dream  
Feel how... Say no more, but stay, yeah...  
The love you are, always... Yeah...  
Feel the motion with this song...  
Like a river churnin', pullin'...  
Ohh... Fade away...  
You said, "where have you been for a hundred years?"  
Out in the sky... You fell beneath...  
Turnin' down a road... Leads I know not where  
Forever turnin' back, yeah...  
Feel the motion with this song...  
Like a river churnin', pullin'...  
Feel the motion with this song...  
Like a river... Like an

Here's a token of my openness  
Of my need to not disappear  
How I'm feeling so revealing to me  
I found my mind too clear  
I just need someone to be there for.. me  
I just want someone to be there for.. me  
  
All the static in my attic a  
Shoots down my side nerve  
To the ocean of my platitudes  
Longitudes latitudes it's so absurd  
I just need someone to be there for..  
I just want someone to be there for..  
Someone to be there for..  
  
Cause I'll stop trying to make a difference  
I'm not trying to make a difference  
I'll stop trying to make a difference  
  
No way  
  
Ooh, let's call in an angel  
  
Cause I'll stop trying to make a difference  
I'm not trying to make a difference  
I'll stop trying to make a difference  
  
No way  
  
Cause I'll stop trying to make a difference  
I'm not trying to make a difference  
I'm not trying to make a difference  
No way  
No way, no way  
Let's call in an angel  
Who's calling an angel?

Restless soul enjoy your youth  
Like Muhammad it's the truth  
Can't escape from the common rule  
If you hate something don't you do it too... it too...  
Small my table, it sits just two  
Got so crowded I can't make room  
Oh where did they come from? Stormed my room!  
And you dare say it belongs to you... to you...  
This is not for you (3x)  
Oh not for you... ah you...  
... scream... my friends... don't call me...  
... friends, no they don't scream...  
... my friends don't call... my friends don't...  
All that's sacred comes from youth  
Dedication, naive and true  
With no power, nothing to do  
I still remember, why don't you... don't you...  
This is not for you (3x)  
Oh, never was for you... fuck you...  
This is not for you...  
Oh, this is not for you... yeah, you...  
This is not for you...  
Oh, not for you...  
Oh, you...

Don't feel like home  
Ease a little out  
And all these words alone is nothing like a poem  
Putting in, inputting in  
Don't feel like methadone  
A scratching voice all alone is nothing like your baritone  
  
It's nothing as it seems  
All that he needs is home  
The little that he sees  
Is nothing he concedes  
It's home  
  
One uninvited chromosome  
A blanket like the ozone  
  
It's nothing as it seems  
All that he needs is home  
The little that he frees is nothing he believes  
  
Saving up a sunny day  
Something maybe two tone  
Anything of his own  
A chip off the corner stone  
Who's kidding?  
Rainy day  
A one way ticket headstone  
An occupation overthrown  
From a whisper through a megaphone  
  
It's nothing as it seems  
All that he needs is home  
And all that he sees is nothing he conceives  
But it's home  
  
And all that he frees  
A little bittersweet is home  
It's nothing as it seems  
The little that you see is home

Once divided...nothing left to subtract...  
Some words when spoken...can't be taken back...  
Walks on his own...with thoughts he can't help thinking...  
Future's above...but in the past he's slow and sinking...  
Caught a bolt 'a lightnin'...cursed the day he let it go...  
Nothingman... (2x)  
Isn't it something?  
Nothingman...  
She once believed...in every story he had to tell...  
One day she stiffened...took the other side...  
Empty stares...from each corner of a shared prison cell...  
One just escapes...one's left inside the well...  
And he who forgets...will be destined to remember...oh...oh...oh...  
Nothingman... (2x)  
Isn't it something?  
Nothingman...  
Oh, she don't want him...  
Oh, she won't feed him...after he's flown away...  
Oh, into the sun...ah, into the sun...  
Burn...burn...  
Nothingman... (2x)  
Isn't it something?  
Nothingman...  
Nothingman... (2x)  
Coulda' been something...  
Nothingman...  
Oh...ohh...ohh...

Oh, he deals 'em off, off the top, ties 'em off  
Fills it up with his past, gets carried away  
Oh, half his life, a hand-me-down, wasted away  
Oh, he fills it up with the love of a girl  
  
Oh, he left it alone, drilled the pain with money to buy  
  
How he makes his getaway  
How he makes his getaway  
  
Oh, he chose a path, heavy the fall, quarter to four  
Fills his mind with the thought of a girl  
  
How he makes his getaway  
How he makes his getaway  
How he makes his getaway  
Getaway

If I could reach to the sky and touch it for my country  
Get some on my finger and take in its smell  
The smell of victory land of the free Olympic dream  
My Olympic dream  
My promotion scheme  
How hard can it be  
How high can I jump  
How high can I throw  
How high can I run  
How high can I hold my breath and stay underwater  
And wave my legs around in perfect unison with my partner who really doesn't
understand me  
For my Olympic dream  
I'll be like Dwight Stone  
I'll be like Bruce Jenner  
I'll be like that girl who trained all her life as a distance runner and then
tripped with a quarter mile to go  
But I I will get up and I will run  
I will run with the Georgia peach breeze and I will win  
I will win my Olympic dream  
The gold's just not good enough  
And I don't even think of the bronze  
I've????? My life for Olympic Platinum  
Olympic dream  
I'll sing like Whitney  
My Olympic dream

I admit it, what's to say  
I'll relive it, without pain  
Backstreet lover on the side  
Of the road  
I got a bomb in my temple that is gonna explode  
I got a .16 gauge buried  
Under my clothes, I play  
  
Once upon a time I could control myself  
Once upon a time I could lose myself  
Oh try and mimic, what's insane  
I am in it, where do I stand?  
  
Indian summer I hate the heat  
I got a backstreet lover on the passenger seat  
I got my hand in my pocket  
So determined  
Discreet, I pray.  
  
Once upon a time I could control myself  
Once upon a time I could lose myself  
Once upon a time I could control myself  
Once upon a time I could lose myself  
Once upon a time I could love myself  
Once upon a time I could love you  
Once  
Once  
Once  
Once  
Once  
Once  
Yeah yeah

It's not the same without you up here  
Can't find my wheels  
Your absence is what breeds this fear  
Warm breath and all it steals  
  
You can't know how it feels to be in here  
All the dark horse fields, befriendin' me  
Playin' ain't the same without you here  
We've come to hate the golden rule  
  
Cannot seem to make the dots connect  
The morning light don't show you near  
You can't know what it's like to bleed from here  
The blackened world grows white, it goes nowhere  
  
Oooh hoo..  
Death ain't the same without you, dear  
I make the others run and hide  
New York streets seem to make it worse  
  
All this noise inside the quiet  
I can't hold on, the weight you bear  
My body's broken fast, please lift me up  
You can't know what it's like to be inside  
  
The fading melodies can't beat my need  
I'm not the same without you here  
How can I quit to be there  
Sit and stare  
  
Stare..  
Begging for a prayer

Why deny all the troubles when combined  
With the missing links it don't feel like home now  
  
That your gone all the troubles suddenly explained infinitum  
You're always wishing and never here at home  
  
You all the dreams we shared and  
Lights we turned on  
But the house is getting dark  
  
And I don't want to know your past  
But together share the dawn  
And I won't need nothing else  
Cause when we're dead  
We would've had it all and died  
  
I would've fallen from the sky til you  
Parachutes have opened now  
  
Heaven knows if there's a ceiling  
Come so low with the kneeling  
Please know that I got all the friends I'm needing  
Before my light go out  
As the doors are closing now  
  
And far away will be my home  
And to grasp this, I don't know  
But I don't need  
Further back and forth, a wave will break on me today  
  
And love  
Wish the world could glow again with love  
One can't see to have enough  
  
And war  
Break the sky and tell me what it's for  
I'll travel there on my own  
  
And love  
What a different life  
Had I not found this love with you

:  
  
I never can say goodbye, no, no, no, no, now.  
I never can say goodbye.  
  
Even though the pain and heartache  
Seems to follow me wherever I go,  
Though I try and try to hide my feelings,  
They always seems to show,  
  
Then you try to say you're leaving me  
And I always have to say no,  
Tell me why is it so.  
  
That I never can say goodbye, no, no, no, no, now.  
I never can say goodbye.  
  
Every time I think I've had enough  
And start heading for the door,  
There's a very strange vibration  
Piercing me right through the core,  
It says, "Turn around, you fool, you know you love him more and more."  
Tell me why is it so.  
  
Don't wanna let go.  
Never can say goodbye.  
Girl oo oo baby.  
Never can say goodbye. No no no no no oo.  
Oh, I never can say goodbye.  
Girl oo oo.  
  
I never can say goodbye. No no no no no oo.  
Never can say goodbye, no, no, no, no, now.  
I never can say goodbye.  
  
I keep thinking that our problems  
Soon are all gonna work out.  
But there's that same unhappy feeling,  
There's that anguish, there's that doubt.  
It's the same old dizzy hangup,  
Can't do with you or without.  
Tell me why is it so, don't wanna let you go.

Do you see the way that tree bends? Does it inspire?  
Leaning out to catch the sun's rays...a lesson to be applied...  
Are you gettin' something out of this all encompassing trip?  
You can spend your time alone redigesting past regrets oh...  
Or you can come to terms and realize  
You're the only one who can forgive yourself oh yeah...  
Makes much more sense to live in the present tense...  
Have you ideas on how this life ends?  
Checked your hands and studied the lines?  
Have you the belief that the road ahead ascends off into the light?  
Seems that needlessly it's gettin' harder  
To find an approach and a way to live...  
Are we gettin' something out of this all-encompassing trip?  
You can spend your time alone redigesting past regrets, oh...  
Or you can come to terms and realize...  
You're the only one who cannot forgive yourself, oh...  
A-makes much more sense to live in the present tense...

They don't eat don't sleep  
They don't feed they don't seethe  
Bare their gums when they moan and squeak  
Lick the dirt off a larger one's feet  
They don't push don't crowd  
Congregate until they're much too loud  
Fuck to procreate till they are dead  
Drink the blood of their so called best friend  
  
They don't scurry when something bigger comes their way  
Don't pack themselves together and run as one  
Don't shit where they're not supposed to  
Don't take what's not theirs, they don't compare  
  
They don't scam, don't fight  
Don't oppress an equals given rights  
Starve the poor so they can be well fed  
Line their holes with the dead ones bread  
  
They don't scurry when something bigger comes their way  
Don't pack themselves together and run as one  
Don't shit where they're not supposed to  
Don't take what's not theirs, they don't compare  
  
Rats, They don't compare  
Ben, the two of us need look no more

Watched from the window with a red mosquito...
