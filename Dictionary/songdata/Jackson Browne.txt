I'm a moody and swirling pool, lost in some dark wood  
Angry at a million things and more  
I can do no good  
Ah, but sometimes -  
  
Sometimes I'm a growing blade of grass  
Washed by the rain, bent by the wind  
  
I'm a deeply wounded lonely tree  
Lost in my own way  
Brooding on the saddest things and worse  
I've seen my better day  
  
I'm an old and broken tumbleweed  
Lost on faded sands  
Dreaming of my yesterdays before  
I watch the heat waves dance

I want to live in the world, not inside my head  
I want to live in the world, I want to stand and be counted  
With the hopeful and the willing  
With the open and the strong  
With the voices in the darkness  
Fashioning daylight out of song  
And the millions of lovers  
Alive in the world  
  
I want to live in the world, not behind some wall  
I want to live in the world, where I will hear if another voice should call  
To the prisoner inside me  
To the captive of my doubt  
Who among his fantasies harbors the dream of breaking out  
And taking his chances  
Alive in the world  
  
[Bridge]  
To open my eyes and wake up alive in the world  
To open my eyes and fully arrive in the world  
  
With its beauty and its cruelty  
With its heartbreak and its joy  
With it constantly giving birth to life and to forces that destroy  
And the infinite power of change  
Alive in the world  
  
[Bridge x2]  
To open my eyes and wake up alive in the world  
To open my eyes and fully arrive in the world

All good things got to come to an end  
The thrills have to fade  
Before they come 'round again  
The bills will be paid  
And the pleasure will mend  
All good things got to come to an end  
  
God I wish I was home  
Laying 'round with my friends  
The call of the wild  
Caution thrown to the wind  
The fall of the child  
Where the longing begins  
All good things got to come to an end  
  
Like a river flows  
Rolling 'till it ends in the sea  
Our pleasure grows  
Rolling 'till it ends in you and me  
  
Now as the dark gathers into the sky  
And legions of might go thundering by  
Regions of light grow dim and then die  
And we with our wings  
Wait for morning to fly  
  
Like a river flows  
Rolling 'till it ends in the sea  
Our pleasure grows  
Rolling 'till it ends in you and me  
Rolling 'till it ends in you and me  
Here where the angels  
Have appeared and are gone  
Your face like an ember  
Glows in the dawn  
But I want you to remember  
All wild deeds live on  
All good times, all good friends  
  
All good things got to come to an end  
The thrills have to fade  
Before they come 'round again  
The bills will be paid  
And the pleasure will mend  
All good things got to come to an end  
  
All good times, all good friends  
All good things got to come to an end

Just like a leaf that's just been rained on  
Something of a cloud above, a soon-awaking sun  
And I see the day has just begun  
Feeling windblown, reeling  
I have grown out of my time  
  
And like a circle casting shadows  
Rolling over growing clover fields so far below  
And I see I've just begun to grow  
Climbing, spinning, rhyming  
I am pinning down my time  
  
And like a river flowing seaward  
Bounding down, surrounding things that have puzzled me before  
And I see the ever-open door  
Flirting pure love, certainly  
I'm sure of what I know  
  
Just like a leaf that's just been rained on  
Something of a cloud above, a soon-awaking sun  
And I see the day has just begun  
Feeling windblown, reeling  
I have grown out of my time

Time will come when we know what happened here  
Change will come in time and make it clear  
We learn one thing if we learn at all  
In the secret wars we call our lives, anything can happen  
We watch the days, we make our plans  
We change in ways, a life demands  
But whatever pleasure this life may allow  
I'll give you the love I have for you now  
Because anything can happen in a world so full of fear  
Dreams are whispered in the dead of night and people disappear  
But you hear my heart and you know I'm still here  
Although you know and I know you know  
While I swear I'll never let you go, anything can happen  
Yeah, if this love can happen here  
Anything can  
We watch the days, we make our plans  
We change in ways a life demands  
I'll always remember this time, this place  
The hope in your voice, the light on your face  
Because anything can happen in a world so full of pain  
People give their lives to making war and we call those people sane  
But I love you where your dreams remain  
Though you never say it anymore  
One day there'll be an end to this war and who knows  
We may see what we're here for, anything can happen  
Yeah, if this love has found us here  
Anything can, it can happen  
Anything can, anything can happen  
Anything, anything, anything, anything  

Some of them were dreamers  
And some of them were fools  
Who were making plans and thinking of the future  
With the energy of the innocent  
They were gathering the tools  
They would need to make their journey back to nature  
While the sand slipped through the opening  
And their hands reached for the golden ring  
With their hearts they turned to each other's hearts for refuge  
In the troubled years that came before the deluge  
  
Some of them knew pleasure  
And some of them knew pain  
And for some of them it was only the moment that mattered  
And on the brave and crazy wings of youth  
They went flying around in the rain  
And their feathers, once so fine, grew torn and tattered  
And in the end they traded their tired wings  
For the resignation that living brings  
And exchanged love's bright and fragile glow  
For the glitter and the rouge  
And in a moment they were swept before the deluge  
  
Let the music keep our spirits high  
Let the buildings keep our children dry  
Let creation reveal its secrets by and by, by and by  
When the light that's lost within us reaches the sky  
  
Some of them were angry  
At the way the earth was abused  
By the men who learned how to forge her beauty into power  
And they struggled to protect her from them  
Only to be confused  
By the magnitude of her fury in the final hour  
And when the sand was gone and the time arrived  
In the naked dawn only a few survived  
And in attempts to understand a thing so simple and so huge  
Believed that they were meant to live after the deluge  
  
Let the music keep our spirits high  
Let the buildings keep our children dry  
Let creation reveal it's secrets by and by, by and by  
When the light that's lost within us reaches the sky

Down on the boulevard they take it hard  
They look at life with such disregard  
They say it can't be won  
The way the game is run  
But if you choose to stay  
You end up playing anyway  
It's okay  
The kid's in shock up and down the block  
The folks are home playing beat the clock  
Down at the golden cup  
They set the young ones up  
Under the neon light  
Selling day for night  
It's alright  
Nobody rides for free  
Nobody gets it like they want it to be  
Nobody hands you any guarantee  
Nobody  
The hearts are hard and the times are tough  
Down on the boulevard the night's enough  
And time passes slow  
Between the store front shadows and the street lights glow  
Everybody walks right by like they're safe or something  
They don't know  
Nobody knows you  
Nobody owes you nothin'  
Nobody shows you what they're thinking  
Nobody baby  
Hey, hey, baby  
You got to watch the street, keep your feet  
And be on guard  
Make it pay baby  
It's only time on the boulevard

In the morning when I closed my eyes  
You were sleeping in paradise  
While the room was growing light  
I was holding still with all my might  
  
Oh-what if it's true  
What my heart says  
Oh-what'll I do  
What if this feeling becomes hard to part with  
  
You were meant to play your part  
In the design of a desperate heart  
While you gave your love to me  
I was betting I was getting it free  
  
Oh-if I'd only know  
What your heart cost  
Oh-can we call it a loan  
And a debt that I owe  
On a bet that I lost  
  
In the evening when you see my eyes  
Looking back at you, no disguise  
I'm not sure who you think you'll see  
I'm just hoping you'll still know that it's me  
  
Oh-what if it's true  
Better ask the man inside  
Oh-there seem to be two  
One steals the love  
The other one hides  
  
Yeah-can we call it a loan  
Till I've paid in full for the seeds I've sown  
Yeah-can we say that I've grown in some way  
That we may have yet to be shown  
  
Oh-if I'd only known  
What your heart cost  
Oh-can we call it a loan  
And a debt that I own  
On a bet that I lost

Daughter of a woman who comes and goes,  
Candy  
Daugher of a man she barely knows,  
Candy  
All grown up about the things, people know to do,  
How to take a love, and tear it in two  
No no no, that isn't how it's gonna be  
For Candy  
She wants to be in love but she doesn't know why,  
Candy  
They think she's a child, but look at her,  
My my Candy  
Step by step, this is her debut  
Looking for love, that's made to stay true  
Step by step, she's looking for more than I see  
For Candy  
Candy, you know what your love is worth  
It's a good thing  
Candy, take care of your own love first  
What the world needs know  
All the young men want to pin her down.  
Candy  
If you're looking for a real love, it's a ghost town  
Candy  
Step by step, this her debut  
Looking for love that's made to stay true  
Step by step, she's looking for more than I see  
For Candy  

In a weapons producing nation under Jesus  
In the fabled crucible of the free world  
Camera crews search for clues amid the detritus  
And entertainment shapes the land  
The way the hammer shapes the hand  
  
Gleaming faces in the checkout counter at the Church of Fame  
The lucky winners cheer Casino Nation  
All those not on TV only have themselves to blame  
And don't quite seem to understand  
The way the hammer shapes the hand  
  
Out beyond the ethernet the spectrum spreads  
DC to daylight, the cowboy mogul rides  
Never worry where the gold for all this glory's gonna come from  
Get along dogies, it's coming out of your hides  
  
The intentional cultivation of a criminal class  
The future lit by brightly burning bridges  
Justice fully clothed to hide the heart of glass  
That shatters in a thousand Ruby Ridges  
And everywhere the good prepare for perpetual war  
And let their weapons shape the plan  
The way the hammer shapes the hand

Lying next to you in the dark  
Listening to your pounding heart  
The sheets are tangled around your waist  
I watch the dream moving on your face  
I feel you shake, hear your cries  
Running in the dark trying to open your eyes  
Come on baby, wake up  
I've followed you across the days and years  
I've been there for the thrills and the tears  
Chasing you from state to state  
Waking, dreaming, I try to relate  
Why should I be somebody you fear?  
When you're asleep and I'm so near?  
Don't even know why I'm in your dreams  
I got control over none of these things  
Morning comes, hard and bright  
And I'm exhausted from running after you all night  
Chasing you into the light  
Yeah I've been reaching for you baby  
As if I could reach you when you dream at night  
But I never can quite  
I ain't lying here awake by myself you better wake up  
There's something I want to talk to you about you better wake up  
I love you girl, tell the world I do there's nothing I wouldn't do for you  
I want to rescue you like you rescued me  
From a life of doubt and uncertainty  
That's why I'm chasing you chasing you into the light  
Go for a walk on the pier with me baby  
Now as the dawn comes over the night  
Watching the stars in the sky disappear maybe  
You'll find a way to let go of your fright  
The sea is deep, the world is wide  
Ships are leaving for the other side  
This whole city will be waking soon and in the east  
Clouds are strung out behind the moon  
Chasing her into the light wake up  
I ain't lying here awake by myself you better wake up  
There's something I got to talk to you about you better wake up  
Baby wake up, wake up, baby wake up, wake up, wake up  

You take Sally and I'll take Sue  
There ain't no difference between the two  
Cocaine, running all 'round my brain  
  
Headin' down Scott, turnin' up Main  
Looking for that girl who sells cocaine  
Cocaine, runnin' all 'round my brain  
  
Mmmm momma come here quick,  
That old Cocaine 'bout to make me sick  
Cocaine, runnin' all 'round my brain  
  
Late last night about a quarter past four  
Ladanyi come knockin' down my hotel room door  
Where's the cocaine  
It's runnin' all 'round my brain  
  
I was talking to my doctor down at the hospital  
He said, "Son, it says here you're twenty-seven,  
But that's impossible  
Cocaine you look like you could be forty-five"  
  
Now I'm losing touch with reality and I'm almost out of blow  
It's such a fine line I hate to see it go  
Cocaine, runnin' all 'round my brain

Colors of the sun  
Flashing on the water top  
Echo on the land  
  
Picking for a coin  
Many other tiny worlds  
Singing past my hand  
  
Awake to understand you are not dreaming  
It is not seaming just to be this way  
Dying men draw numbers in the air  
Dream to conquer little bits of time  
Scuffle with the crowd to get their share  
And fall behind their little bits of time  
  
Voices in the air  
Sympathetic harmony  
Coming from the trees  
  
Hanging at my door  
Many shiny surfaces  
Clinging in the breeze  
  
Oh, leave me where I am I am not losing  
If I am choosing not to plan my life  
Disillusioned savior search the sky  
Wanting to just to show someone the way  
Asking all the people passing by  
Doesn't anybody want the way  
  
I say goodbye to Joseph and Maria  
They think I see another sky  
And from my fallen window I still see them  
I'll never free them from the sky

I live in a small town . . . deep in LA  
About five miles north of where the Lakers play  
Everybody here's from someplace else  
Working all together just like Santa's elves  
  
Baby, Culver me  
And I'll Culver you  
When the streets are shining with the smoggy dew  
When the lights are glowing with the mists of June  
And the whole world is lit up by the Culver Moon  
  
Baby don't worry 'bout Angelyne  
She ain't the prettiest thing I've ever seen  
Nothing she wears ever fits her right  
And her complexion is just a little too tight  
And the way she looks down from so high above  
Makes me think the poor child's never been in love  
  
Baby, Culver me  
And I'll Culver you  
When the streets are shining with the smoggy dew  
When the lights are glowing with the mists of June  
And the whole world is lit up by the Culver Moon  
  
Baby I'm going to love you 'til the stars come down  
'Til they park their limos and they walk to town  
'Til the L.A. river overflows its banks  
'Til the whole alternative nation bows its knobby head in thanks  
'Til the fish are jumping in Ballona Creek  
'Til the earth is inherited by the meek  
  
Baby, Culver me  
And I'll Culver you  
When the streets are shining with the smoggy dew  
When the lights are glowing with the mists of June  
And the whole world is illuminated by the Culver Moon  
  
Under the rainbow and behind Versailles  
From the aisles of Fedco to the 405  
From MGM to Veteran's Park  
Way down at Chippendale's fumblin' in the dark  
Where the ghostly specter of Howard Hughes  
Hovers in the smoke of a thousand barbeques  
  
Baby, Culver me  
And I'll Culver you  
When the streets are shining with the smoggy dew  
When the lights are glowing with the mists of June  
And the whole world is lit up by the Culver Moon

Cut it away, somebody cut away this desperate heart  
Cut it away and help me find my way back to the start  
Yeah, before I knew what I was looking for  
Yeah, when we were lovers and nothing more  
  
I wanted you and I did everything that I could do  
To capture you I let you see the part of me  
You'd want to see a fantasy  
I'm finding now I don't know how  
To make it good I wish I could  
  
Cut it away this crazy longing for something more  
Cut it away the question I don't have an answer for  
Why I hunger for something I can't see  
Cut it away the dream I wanted life to be  
  
I know I've got to let you go  
I know you should have left a long time ago  
  
Protected by the night two cities lay  
Two hearts, two lives connected by our sight  
World's away, two hearts, two lives inspected by the light  
Two hearts, two cities in decay  
Two lives repair them as we might  
Two hearts just go on crumbling, now come on  
  
Cut it away I want to cut away this thing inside  
Cut it away this thing that hid from you and schemed and lied  
I know I've got to let you go  
I know you should have left a long time ago  
  
Cut it away, somebody cut away this desperate heart  
Cut it away before it tears my whole life apart  
I love you, I love you still, I do  
I always will

A dirty wind blows through the sky  
And the autumn leaves cut loose and fly  
Leave me watching  
And wishing I could follow  
Though among the regrets that I can't get by  
There are just one or two  
Unkind things I said to you  
Daddy what was I supposed to do?  
I don't know why it was so hard to talk to you  
I guess my anger pulled me through  
  
No sooner had I hit the streets  
When I met the fools that a young fool meets  
All in search of truth and bound for glory  
And listening to our own heartbeats  
We stood around the drum  
Though it's fainter now  
The older I become  
Living your life day after day  
Soon all your plans and changes  
Either fail or fade away  
Leaving so much still left to say  
  
But Daddy I want to let you know somehow  
The things you said are so much clearer now  
And I would turn the pages back  
But time will not allow  
The way these days just rip along  
Too fast to last, too vast, too strong  
  
Somewhere something went wrong  
Or maybe we forgot the song  
Make room for my forty-fives  
Along beside your seventy-eights  
Nothing survives  
But the way we live our lives

Down the side streets and the avenue  
There be sisters walkin' two by two  
Their dresses and their shoes are new  
But their hearts are weary through and through  
And it's a long way into the light of the day  
While the jukebox and the radio play  
  
Where the days turn into the nights  
People move into the sounds and sights  
Like the moth is drawn into the lights  
Like the tight-rope walker into the heights  
It's in their hearts, it's in their hips,  
It's in their feet, it's on their lips  
  
Tonight's the night I'm gonna make you mine  
Gonna dance right out onto the edge of time  
When the sound starts pumpin'  
And the lights are flashin'  
And my hearts-a-thumpin'  
And I feel the passion  
And the world is right there waiting  
At my finger tips  
Disco... apocalypse  
  
In the dawn the city seems to sigh  
And the hungry hear their children cry  
People watch the time go by  
They do their jobs and live and die  
And in their dreams they rise above  
By strength, or hate, or luck, or love  
  
Tonight's the night I'm gonna make you mine  
Gonna dance right out onto the edge of time  
When the world starts turnin'  
And the dreams are burnin'  
And the skies awaken  
Through the wind and the fire  
They will be dancing still  
  
It's in their hearts, it's in their hips,  
It's in their feet, it's on their lips  
A single sound that never ends  
They die each night and live again  
  
I'm gonna make you mine  
Tonight's the night  
Out on the edge of time  
With the dreams of flesh and love dancing in my mind  
Dancing through the fire on the edge of time

Doctor, my eyes have seen the years  
And the slow parade of fears without crying  
Now I want to understand  
  
I have done all that I could  
To see the evil and the good without hiding  
You must help me if you can  
  
Doctor, my eyes  
Tell me what is wrong  
Was I unwise to leave them open for so long  
  
'Cause I have wandered through this world  
As each moment has unfurled  
I've been waiting to awaken from these dreams  
  
People go just where they will  
I never noticed them until I got this feeling  
That it's later than it seems  
  
Doctor, my eyes  
Tell me what you see  
I hear their cries  
Just say if it's too late for me  
  
Doctor, my eyes  
Cannot see the sky  
Is this the prize for having learned how not to cry

Don't you want to be there, don't you want to go?  
Where the light is breaking and the cold clear winds blow  
Don't you want to be there in the golden glow  
  
Don't you want to be there, don't you want to fly?  
With your arms out, let a shout take you across the sky  
Don't you want to be there when the time's gone by  
  
Times there was love all around you  
Times you were strong and alone  
Times you believed love had found you  
And you fell through time like a stone  
  
And those you have wronged, you know  
You need to let them know some way  
And those who have wronged you, know  
You'll have to let them go someday  
  
Don't you want to be there?  
Don't you want to cry when you see how far  
You've got to go to be where forgiveness rules  
Instead of where you are  
  
Don't you want to be there, don't you want to know?  
Where the grace and simple truth of childhood go  
Don't you want to be there when the trumpets blow  
  
Blow for those born into hunger  
Blow for those lost 'neath the train  
Blow for those choking in anger  
Blow for those driven insane  
  
And those you have wronged, you know  
You need to let them know some way  
And those who have wronged you, know  
You'll have to let them go someday  
  
Don't you want to be there?  
Don't you want to see where the angels appear  
Don't you want to be where there's strength and love  
In the place of fear

They were duelin' Doolin-Dalton  
High or low it was the same  
Easy money an' faithless women  
Redeye whiskey for the pain  
  
Go down Bill Dalton it must be God's will  
Two brothers lyin' dead in Coffeyville  
Two voices call to you from were they stood  
Lay down your law books now they're no damn good  
  
Better keep on movin' Doolin-Dalton  
'Til your shadow sets you free  
An' if you're fast an' if you're lucky  
You will never see that hangin' tree  
  
Old towns lay out across the dusty plains  
Like graveyards filled with tomb stones waitin' for the names  
And a man could his back or use his brains  
But some just went stir crazy Lord 'cause nothin' ever changed  
  
'Til Bill Doolin met Bill Dalton  
He was workin' cheap just bidin' time  
An' then he laughed and said I'm going  
And so he left that peaceful life behind

Well the stage was set, the sun was sinking lowdown  
As they came to town to face another showdown  
The lawmen cleared the people from the street  
All you blood thirsty bystanders, will you try to find your seat  
  
Watch 'em duelin', Doolin-Dalton  
High or low its all the same  
Easy money an' faithless women  
You will never kill the pain  
  
Go down Bill Doolin don't you wonder why  
Sooner or later we all have to die  
Sooner or later that's a stone cold fact  
Four men ride out and only three ride back

Downtown people gotta work a little harder  
Working downtown  
Downtown, they got to think a little quicker  
'Cause they're downtown  
Downtown, the breaks are harder  
Downtown, the thieves are smarter  
I've got this place I'm renting  
It cost me next to nothing, downtown  
Nobody comes around telling me  
I gotta turn the sound down  
Broadway, down on the corner  
The Bible screamer, the plasma donor  
Buses, car horns, ghetto blasters  
The shouts and cries of the human disasters  
It's all music  
It's all music  
Downtown  
It's all music  
It's all music  
I feel alright when I'm downtown  
My feet are light when I'm downtown  
I cast my hopes on the human tide  
I place my bet and let it ride  
I'm open wide when I'm downtown  
Downtown, there's every kind of people  
Walkin' 'round downtown  
Downtown, there's every language  
Every human sound, downtown  
Downtown, the nights are longer  
Downtown, the sights are stronger  
Downtown, wandering all around, downtown  
It's all music  
Eight blocks south of city hall  
The rats run free and the winos crawl  
Darkness falls on the vast machine  
Where the future stalks the American dream  
I feel alright when I'm downtown  
My head feels light when I'm downtown  
It's all in sight when I'm downtown  
I feel alright when I'm downtown  

You used to stand on the tables  
You used to shoot out the lights  
You used to stop trucks on aisle 19  
In your blue leopard tights  
You got the vote of your high school  
Most likely to exceed  
But not likely to ever get enough  
Enough of what you need  
Enough of the night  
Enough of the night  
And now the carnival lights come down  
The sounds of laughter recede  
You sit and drink in this cardboard town  
The fast lane gone to seed  
You used to laugh about the damage done  
But there was no way to know  
How little distance you had actually come  
And how far you'd have to go  
It's tough to do baby, it's tough to make it  
When the heart is naked  
It's tough for you baby, it's tough for me too  
Without all this pain to see through  
Now I want to see you smile  
You know how it's just been awhile  
Don't allow another night to close  
On your empty cup, you've had enough of those  
Enough of the night  
Enough of the night  
You used to count on the miracles  
The old shot in the dark  
You used to wait for the setting sun  
To help you hit your mark  
You used to stand on the tables  
You used to shoot out the lights  
You dressed right out of the fables, baby  
Like the Arabian Nights  
But you were never the princess  
More like the queen of the thieves  
And my heart was never more than one of the many  
A queen receives  
It's tough to do baby, it's tough to make it  
When the heart is naked  
It's tough for you baby, it's tough for me too  
Without this disdain to see through  
Now, I want to see you smile  
You know how, it's just been awhile  
Don't allow another heart to pass  
Beyond your reach, say baby not so fast, hey baby not so fast  
You've had enough of the night  
To fill the street with tears  
You've had enough of those empty hours  
To last a thousand years  
Enough of the night  
Enough of the tears  
Enough of the night  
Enough of the tears  
Enough of the night  
Enough of tears  
She got enough of the night  
She had enough of the tears, baby  
She had enough of night  
She got enough of, had enough of the night  
She got enough of, bop bop baby  
You got enough of night  
You had enough of tears, bop bop bop  
She got enough of  

I hear your heart beating everywhere  
When we're apart I can hear you there  
I hear your heart beating everywhere  
Everywhere I go  
  
People say that I must be in love  
The way I forget what we're speaking of  
The way I stand there smiling straight ahead  
And walk away without hearing a word they said  
  
I hear your heart beating everywhere  
When we're apart I can close my eyes and hear you there  
I hear your heart beating everywhere  
Everywhere I go  
  
In the middle of the football game  
At the beach in the pouring rain  
Standing on a hillside staring at the sun  
People hurry by the unfortunate one  
With the faraway eyes and the mystery smile  
Moving my body in a ragamuffin style  
I can't sit down when I hear it start  
I hear your heart everywhere I go  
  
People say that I must be a fool  
Cause when I'm near you I cannot be cool  
I don't quite make sense when I talk to you  
And when you smile I forget everything I knew  
  
I hear your heart beating everywhere  
When we're apart I can close my eyes and hear you there  
I hear your heart beating everywhere  
Everywhere I go  
  
Standing in the market where I buy my bread  
With a hunger in my belly and a rhythm in my head  
Looking all around for something good to eat  
Between the butter and the beans and the mops and the meat  
Coffee from the mountain, honey from the bee  
Nothing tastes as good as you taste to me  
Rocking in the aisle to my inside song  
People staring at me think I got a Walkman on  
  
I hear your heart beating everywhere  
I hear your heart  
I hear your heart beating everywhere  
I hear your heart  
Beating everywhere I go

In my early years i hid my tears  
And passed my days alone  
Adrift on an ocean of loneliness  
My dreams like nets were thrown  
To catch the love that I'd heard of  
In books and films and songs  
Now there's a world of illusion and fantasy  
In the place where the real world belongs  
  
Still i look for the beauty in songs  
To fill my head and lead me on  
Though my dreams have come up torn and empty  
As many times as love has come and gone  
  
To those gentle ones my memory runs  
To the laughter we shared at the meals  
I filled their kitchens and living rooms  
With my schemes and my broken wheels  
It was never clear how far or near  
The gates to my citadel lay  
They were cutting from stone some dreams of their own  
But they listened to mine anyway  
  
I'm not sure what i'm trying to say  
It could be i've lost my way  
Though i keep a watch over the distance  
Heaven's no closer than it was yesterday  
  
And the angels are older  
They know not to wait up for the sun  
They look over my shoulder  
At the maps and the drawings of the journey I've begun  
  
Now the distance leads me farther on  
Though the reasons i once had are gone  
I keep thinking I'll find what I'm looking for  
In the sand beneath the dawn  
  
But the angels are older  
They can see that the sun's setting fast  
They look over my shoulder  
At the vision of paradise contained in the light of the past  
And they lay down behind me  
To sleep beside the road till the morning has come  
Where they know they will find me  
With my maps and my faith in the distance  
Moving farther on

Open the door, baby turn on the light  
We're gonna have a party tonight  
For a rock, for a rocker  
I know it's late and you're already down  
You ain't ready for people around  
I'm gonna tell you something I found out  
Whatever you think your life is about  
Whatever life may hold in store  
Things will happen that you won't be ready for  
I've got a shirt so unbelievably bright  
I'm gonna dig it out and wear it tonight  
For a rocker, for a rocker  
For a rocker, for a rocker  
Don't have to change, don't have to be sweet  
Gonna be too many people to possibly meet  
Don't have to feed 'em, they don't eat  
They've got their power supplies in the soles of their feet  
They exist for one thing, and one thing only  
To escape living the lives of the lonely  
For a friend of mine, from the neighborhood  
Moving down the line, after tonight he'll be gone for good  
Here comes Ricky, Danny, and Doerge  
They got Pete's number and they're looking at me  
Russell and Bobby setting up the drums  
Gonna pound on 'till the landlord comes  
Don't want to argue, I don't want to fight  
But there will definitely be a party tonight  
For a rocker, for a rocker  
For a rocker, for a rocker  
'Till the morning comes, 'till the car arrives  
'Till we kill the drums, 'till we lose our lives  
Hey Jenny, tell Peggy Sue  
We're gonna do the only thing you can do  
For a rocker, for a rocker  
For a rocker, for a rocker  
There's a party tonight!  
There's a party tonight!  
There's a party tonight!  
There's a party tonight!  

As if I really didn't understand  
That I was just another part of their plan  
I went off looking for the promise  
Believing in the Motherland  
And from the comfort of a dreamer's bed  
And the safety of my own head  
I went on speaking of the future  
While other people fought and bled  
The kid I was when I first left home  
Was looking for his freedom and a life of his own  
But the freedom that he found wasn't quite as sweet  
When the truth was known  
I have prayed for America  
I was made for America  
It's in my blood and in my bones  
By the dawn's early light  
By all I know is right  
We're going to reap what we have sown  
  
As if freedom was a question of might  
As if loyalty was black and white  
You hear people say it all the time-  
"My country wrong or right"  
I want to know what that's got to do  
With what it takes to find out what's true  
With everyone from the President on down  
Trying to keep it from you  
  
The thing I wonder about the Dads and Moms  
Who send their sons to the Vietnams  
Will they really think their way of life  
Has been protected as the next war comes?  
I have prayed for America  
I was made for America  
Her shining dream plays in my mind  
By the rockets red glare  
A generation's blank stare  
We better wake her up this time  
  
The kid I was when I first left home  
Was looking for his freedom and a life of his own  
But the freedom that he found wasn't quite a sweet  
When the truth was known  
I have prayed for America  
I was made for America  
I can't let go till she comes around  
Until the land of the free  
Is awake and can see  
And until her conscience has been found

For taking the trouble, for hanging on and tryin'  
You've been working through the rubble of a shattered mind  
Yeah Baby, tell me why the tears are falling from your eye  
Tears of laughter, tears of grief, are they the tears of a captured thief?  
You thought that you were home free, you thought you had her well in hand  
But there were things about her you didn't understand  
Yeah Baby, tell me how you're gonna keep that promise now?  
To live your life without regret and make it work with what you get  
You didn't then, but now you know  
When she began to lie, you really should have let her go  
You're learnin' how to talk about it, you're learnin' how to bend  
It's like you're learning how to walk all over again  
Yeah Baby, tell me who you're gonna give your lovin' to?  
That girl who catches every eye or the one you can set your compass by  
You set it by her soulful smile, the fire in her eye  
And the way she goes that extra mile  
The love you wanted this to be is somewhere down the line  
You'll find her eventually  
Your grandma and her grandma are sittin' 'round heaven discussin' the law  
Lovin' that girl was not your crime, livin' without her gonna take some time  
Lovin' that girl next thing you knew, you'd turned away from the thing you do  
Lovin' that girl, you couldn't see, living without her gonna make you free  

Looking through some photographs I found inside a drawer  
I was taken by a photograph of you  
There were one or two I know that you would have liked a little more  
But they didn't show your spirit quite as true  
  
You were turning 'round to see who was behind you  
And I took your childish laughter by surprise  
And at the moment that my camera happened to find you  
There was just a trace of sorrow in your eyes  
  
Now the things that I remember seem so distant and so small  
Though it hasn't really been that long a time  
What I was seeing wasn't what was happening at all  
Although for a while, our path did seem to climb  
When you see through love's illusions, there lies the danger  
And your perfect lover just looks like a perfect fool  
So you go running off in search of a perfect stranger  
While the loneliness seems to spring from your life  
Like a fountain from a pool  
  
Fountain of sorrow, fountain of light  
You've known that hollow sound of your own steps in flight  
You've had to hide sometimes, but now you're all right  
And it's good to see your smiling face tonight  
  
Now for you and me it may not be that hard to reach our dreams  
But that magic feeling never seems to last  
And while the future's there for anyone to change, still you know it seems  
It would be easier sometimes to change the past  
I'm just one or two years and a couple of changes behind you  
In my lessons at love's pain and heartache school  
Where if you feel too free and you need something to remind you  
There's this loneliness springing up from your life  
Like a fountain from a pool  
  
Fountain of sorrow, fountain of light  
You've known that hollow sound of your own steps in flight  
  
You've had to hide sometimes but now you're all right  
And it's good to see your smiling face tonight  
  
Fountain of sorrow, fountain of light  
You've known that hollow sound of your own steps in flight  
You've had to struggle, you've had to fight  
To keep understanding and compassion in sight  
You could be laughing at me, you've got the right  
But you go on smiling so clear and so bright

I'm here at Fourth and Main  
Been standing in the rain  
I feel no joy, I feel no pain  
I got nothing to lose, nothing to gain  
I'm at Fourth and Main  
Been down at City Hall  
Been writing on the wall  
The grass is wet and the trees are tall  
I listen to the pigeons, to the raindrops fall  
I'm at City Hall  
Been down at Pershing Square  
I can't seem to care  
If the people stop or the people stare  
I don't care if I'm leaving, I'm going somewhere  
I'm at Pershing Square

Did you see our brother  
He was here the other day  
But he only came to say that he was leaving  
Did you see his lady  
She was looking where he'd gone  
But she wasn't letting on  
That she was grieving  
  
She's bound to go  
Perhaps she'll find him waiting  
For his boat in some city far away  
She's bound to go  
  
Lately I remember  
Afternoons of smoke and wine  
There was nothing we could find  
But peace and pleasure  
And with a smile he told me  
That he wanted just to be on his way  
Across the sea no man can measure  
  
He won't be back,  
And the sun may find him sleeping  
In the dust of some ruin far away  
He won't be back  
  
Early today as I watched while  
The skyline was shaking  
I heard a rumbling  
Early today the mechanical city was waking  
And I ran out stumbling, mumbling  
Out through the laughter  
Of children and dogs  
  
Did you see our brother  
He was here the other day  
But he only came to say that  
He can't breathe here  
Did you see his lady  
She was reaching for his hand  
Just as if to tell her man  
That she can't either  
  
They're bound to go  
And the sun may find me running after them,  
Seeing something far away  
We won't be back  
  
...COUNTER SONG AT THE END OF "FROM SILVER LAKE"  
.....Someone who had been away  
.....Suddenly came back today  
.....And I allowed him home today into my mind  
.....For a moment face to face  
.....Evil packed upon the place  
.....Long ago he meant to stay out there this time  
.....Oh, what do you know  
.....The love that I've been feeling  
.....The past is healing so slow  
.....By tomorrow, gone from sorrow.

Well it's funny you should ask me how I feel  
As the scenes before my eyes begin to reel  
I can't remember how long I cried  
I can't remember how hard I tried  
Turned my thoughts away from you  
Like I had something else to do  
And now I find you here  
  
And it's funny you should want to see me now  
Well I'd refuse you but I can't remember how  
I can't remember how long I cried  
I can't remember how hard I tried  
I'd tell myself I didn't care  
That I was down and you weren't there  
You've been away so long  
  
And it's funny you should want to know my plans  
As the future disappears beneath my hands  
I can't remember how long I cried  
I can't remember how hard I tried  
Now I'll cast aside my memories  
And shut you out most bitterly  
I'm down on my last smile

I could write for you  
A song about the warming of september  
But I couldn't really give to you  
That month in the spring  
  
And I could write for you  
Melodies dedicated to the seasons  
But I'd be caught behind  
Remembering a reason not to sing  
  
And the music would accompany  
The words it brings along  
Why should I try  
How can I try  
I can't give you the seasons in a song  
  
I could paint for you  
A picture with a swirling world of color  
But I couldn't really give to you  
The brush strokes of my mind  
  
And in my ticker-tape parade  
All the memories of all my failures  
Would be summoned in  
And made to walk a step or two behind  
  
And models seldom find themselves  
In portraits that I've drawn  
But I have cried  
And not denied  
That my colors aren't clear enough in song  
  
You ask of me  
What's a word that rhymes with all your confusion  
Don't you think that's just a little bit  
Unusual to ask  
  
Once you asked of me  
Once before what is a word for all your crying  
But you were laughing at me all the time  
Behind your tragic mask  
  
Now you ask me and my friends  
If you can pack and come along  
Why should I try  
How can I try  
If you can follow the honesty in song  
  
So I'll go skipping through  
All my daydreams at a thousand miles an hour  
And I'll try to sort things out  
Into an order if I can  
  
I've got a couple things to do  
Before I come and talk to you again  
Well I'll meet you in a dream or two  
Down by the borderland  
  
I've got a necessary game to play  
And changes to go through  
It's time to go, time to go  
So it's so long, farewell  
  
And I'll be seeing you

Here come those tears again  
Just when I was getting over you  
Just when I was going to make it through  
Another night without missing you  
Thinking I might just be strong enough after all  
When I hear your footsteps echoing in the hall  
Baby here we stand again  
Like we've been so many times before  
Even though you looked so sure  
As I was watching you walking out my door  
But you always walk back in like you did today  
Acting like you never even went away  
Well I don't know if I can  
Open up and let you in baby  
Here come those tears  
Here come those tears again  
I can hear you telling me  
How you needed to be free  
And you had some things to work out alone  
Now you're standing here telling me  
How you have grown  
Here come those tears again  
Now you'll tell me how to hold them in  
Here come those tears  
Here come those tears again  
Some other time baby  
When I'm strong and feeling fine maybe  
When I can look at you without crying  
You might look like a friend of mine  
But I don't know if I can  
Open up enough to let you in  
Here come those tears  
Here come those tears again  
Just walk away  
I'm going back inside and turning out those light  
And I'll be in the dark but you'll be out of sight

Hold on hold out, keep a hold on strong  
The money's in and the bets are down  
You won't hold out long  
  
They say you'll fall in no time at all  
But you know they're wrong  
Known it all along  
  
Hold on hold out, keep a hold on still  
If you don't see what your love is worth  
No one ever will  
You've done your time on the bottom line  
  
And it ain't no thrill  
There's got to be something more  
Keep a hold on still  
You know what it is you're waiting for  
  
Now you just hold on  
Hold on hold out, hold on  
  
Give up your heart and you lose your way  
Trusting another to feel that way  
Give up your heart and you find yourself  
Living for something in somebody else  
Sometimes you wonder what happens to love  
Sometimes the touch of a friend is enough  
  
Hold a place for the human race  
Keep it open wide  
Give it time to fall or climb  
But let the time decide  
  
Sometimes you wonder what's in this for you  
But you wait, and you see  
'Cause it's all you can do  
Just to hold on  
Hold on hold out, hold on  
  
For the countless souls beaten by their goals  
Keep a hold on now  
And the ones betrayed by the deals they made  
Keep a hold on  
If you hold your ground it'll turn around  
Keep a hold somehow  
  
Hold on hold out, keep a hold on tight  
Tonight's the night  
Wake up and turn on the light  
You fight, and you're right--  
It's gonna take all your might...  
  
You're a hold out  
Well I'm a hold out too  
But it took me all this time to figure out  
Something you already knew  
  
Will love be true? Can it pull you through?  
How long? How strong?  
Some things depend on you  
See-- I always figured I was going to meet somebody here  
  
And I don't know why  
Why should love come down and suddenly just sweep me away  
I want to fly  
But there are so many things in my way  
  
Anyway...  
I guess you wouldn't know unless I told you  
But...  
I love you  
Well just look at yourself--  
What else would I do?  
  
Hold on--

Baby I guess you know my story  
Baby I guess you know my side  
It seems I've traded love for glory  
But I'm still not satisfied  
  
Given all the years  
All the cries and cheers  
Don't amount to much more than pride  
Take my love for you  
Take tomorrow too  
There's not much left inside  
  
How we laughed when we first knew love  
Singing dumb-de-lum-de-lie  
I taught you how to see life through love  
Then I taught you how to cry  
And though I must have known  
How easily love is thrown  
I took some chances, I don't know why  
There's not much you can do  
You wish that I'd been true  
Darlin' so do I  
  
Now you better hold out  
Go on and hold out  
Go ahead and hold out  
For what you know love can be  
Move on and hold out  
Don't let your love be sold out  
If there's anyone who knows about it  
Baby that's me  
  
Ah you're right  
You can't forget the way I lied  
Time has seen you grow,  
To lead your life alone  
Though you tried and tried  
Cried and cried  
  
Baby I guess you know my story  
Maybe there's not much left to say  
You know the more we take the more we  
Turn each other's hearts away  
Now I'll be leaving in the morning  
Leaving half of me behind  
To find the pieces life's been torn in  
And take whatever love I find  
  
But you better hold out  
Go on and hold out  
Just walk away and hold out  
For what you know love can be  
Move on and hold out  
Don't let your love be sold out  
It's starting to be cold out  
For people who live like me  
Move on and hold out  
And somewhere later no doubt  
You'll find another hold out  
Someone just like you baby, wait and see

I'm standing here and hoping for you  
Holding my door open for you now  
Ask just what you will of me  
I'll bend just like a willow tree  
And now I'm holdin'  
Holdin' my door open to the wind  
  
Well seven times she came to me  
And each time seemed the same to me  
She knows just what to ask me now  
And I can't help but wonder how  
And now I'm holdin'  
Holdin' my door open before the wind  
  
I wrote my name upon the sands  
With questioningly weary hands  
The tide arose and answered me  
And washed my name into the sea  
And now I'm holdin'  
Holdin' my door open before the wind

When you look into a child's face  
And you're seeing the human race  
And the endless possibilities there  
Where so much can come true  
And you think of the beautiful things  
A child can do  
  
How long would the child survive  
How long if it was up to you  
  
When you think about the money spent  
On defense by a government  
And the weapons of destruction we've built  
We're so sure that we need  
And you think of the millions and millions  
That money could feed  
  
How long can you hear someone crying  
How long can you hear someone dying  
Before you ask yourself why?  
And how long will we hear people speaking  
About missiles for peace  
And just let it go by  
How long will they tell us these weapons  
Are keeping us free  
That's a lie  
  
If you saw it from a satellite  
With its green and its blue and white  
The beauty of the curve of the earth  
And its oceans below  
You might think that it's turning  
But it's turning so slow  
  
How long can you hear someone crying  
How long can you hear someone dying  
Before you ask yourself why?  
And how long will it be 'till we've turned  
To the tasks and the skills  
That we'll have to have learned  
If we're going to find our place in the future  
And have something to offer  
Where this planet's concerned  
How long?

I am a man of constant sorrow,  
I've seen trouble all my day.  
I bid farewell to old Kentucky,  
The place where I was born and raised.  
(The place where he was born and raised )  
  
For six long years I've been in trouble,  
No pleasures here on earth I found.  
For in this world I'm bound to ramble,  
I have no friends to help me now.  
(He has no friends to help him now.)  
  
It's fare thee well my old lover.  
I never expect to see you again.  
For I'm bound to ride that northern railroad,  
Perhaps I'll die upon this train.  
(Perhaps he'll die upon this train.)  
  
You can bury me in some deep valley,  
For many years where I may lay.  
Then you may learn to love another,  
While I am sleeping in my grave.  
(While he is sleeping in his grave.)  
  
Maybe your friends think I'm just a stranger  
My face, you'll never see no more.  
But there is one promise that is given  
I'll meet you on God's golden shore.  
(He'll meet you on God's golden shore.)

In the calling out to one another  
Of the lovers up and down the strand  
In the sound of the waves and the cries  
Of the seagulls circling the sand  
In the fragments of the songs  
Carried down the wind from some radio  
In the murmuring of the city in the distance  
Ominous and low  
  
I hear the sound of the world where we played  
And the far too simple beauty  
Of the promises we made  
  
If you ever need holding  
Call my name, Ill be there  
If you ever need holding  
And no holding back, Ill see you through  
Sky blue and black  
  
Where the touch of the lover ends  
And the soul of the friend begins  
Theres a need to be separate and a need to be one  
And a struggle neither wins  
Where you gave me the world I was in  
And a place I could make a stand  
I could never see how you doubted me  
When Id let go of your hand  
  
Yeah, and I was much younger then  
And I must have thought that I would know  
If things were going to end  
  
And the heavens were rolling  
Like a wheel on a track  
And our sky was unfolding  
And itll never fold back  
Sky blue and black  
  
And Id have fought the world for you  
If I thought that you wanted me to  
Or put aside what was true or untrue  
If Id known thats what you needed  
What you needed me to do  
  
But the moment has passed by me now  
To have put away my pride  
And just come through for you somehow  
  
If you ever need holding  
Call my name, Ill be there  
If you ever need holding  
And no holding back, Ill see you through  
  
Youre the color of the sky  
Reflected in each store-front window pane  
Youre the whispering and the sighing  
Of my tires in the rain  
Youre the hidden cost and the thing thats lost  
In everything I do  
Yeah and Ill never stop looking for you  
In the sunlight and the shadows  
And the faces on the avenue  
Thats the way love is  
Thats the way love is  
Thats the way love is  
Sky blue and black

It's such a clever innocence with which you do your sorcery  
As if somehow the years just bow and let that young girl go free  
I thought I was a child until you turned and smiled  
I thought I knew where I was going until I heard your laughter flowing  
And came upon the wisdom in your eyes  
Surprise  
  
I've spent my whole life running 'round  
Chasing songs from town to town  
Thinking I'd be free so long as I never let love slow me down  
So lonely and so wild until you turned and smiled  
By now I should have long been gone  
But here I am still looking on  
As if I didn't know which way to run  
  
It's such a clever innocence with which you show myself to me  
As if you know how it feels to never be who you wanted to be  
I thought I was a child until you turned and smiled  
I thought that I was free but I'm just one more prisoner of time  
Alone within the boundaries of my mind  
I thought I was a child

See, I can't scare anybody  
They come from miles around  
To laugh in my face and eat in my field  
  
Said a scarecrow swinging on a pole  
To some blackbirds sittin' on a fence  
"Oh, the Lord gave me a soul,  
But forgot to give me common sense."  
  
Said the blackbirds, "Well, well, well.  
What the thunder would you do with common sense?"  
Said the scarecrow, "Would be pleasin'  
Just to reason out the reason  
Of the wishes and the whyness and the whence."  
  
If I had an once of common sense...  
(If he had an ounce of common sense...)  
  
("Well, what would you do Scarecrow?")  
I would while away the hours  
Conferrin' with the flowers  
Consultin' with the rain  
And my head I'd be scratchin'  
While my thoughts were busy hatchin'  
If I only had a brain  
  
I'd unravel every riddle  
For every individle  
In trouble or in pain  
With the thoughts I'd be thinkin'  
I could be another Lincoln  
If I only had a brain  
  
Oh, I could tell you why  
The ocean's near the shore  
I could think of things I never thought before  
Then I'd sit and think some more  
  
I would not be just a nothin'  
My head all full of stuffin'  
My heart all full of pain  
I would dance and by merry  
Life would be a dingle derry  
If I only had a brain  
  
If I only had a brain...  
(If he only had a brain...)  
  
I could tell you why  
The ocean's near the shore  
I could think of things I never thought before  
And then I'd sit and think some more  
  
Yeah, it would be kind of pleasin'  
To reason out the reason  
For the things I can't explain  
Then perhaps I'd deserve you  
And be even worthy of you  
If I only had a brain  
  
I could dance and by merry  
Life would be a dingle derry  
If I only had a brain  
  
If I only had a brain...  
(If he only had a brain...)

(Jackson Browne, Craig Doerge and Rosemary Butler)  
  
I've been sitting up all night without you  
Trying not to think that much about you  
How do you expect me not to doubt you  
I don't want to but I'm here  
And I can't stop this whispering in my ear  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'll fly away without you, I'll fly away without you  
I'll fly away without you, babe, without you fly away,  
Without you  
  
You know I never wanted to confine you  
I always let you come and go your way  
Honey, if you let that freedom blind you, you know I won't wait around  
It took too long to find this love we found  
  
I'll fly away wthout you, I'll fly away without you  
I'll fly away if you don't do something to make me stay  
I want to, but I can't be the only one to say I want you  
  
When I think how easily you caught me  
Well, it wasn't hard to pull me to the ground  
Whether it was something that you taught me  
Or just something that I found  
Loving you is all that holds me down  
  
I'll fly away without you, I'll fly away without you  
I'll fly away if you don't do something to make me stay  
I want to, but I can't be the only one to say I want to  
And I won't have your love no other way  
  
[Chorus:]

It's been a long time since I watched these lights alone  
I look around my life tonight and you are gone  
I might have done something to keep you if I'd known  
How unhappy you had become  
  
While I was dreaming of you  
With my heart in your hands  
And I was following though  
With my beautiful plans  
  
Yeah now I'm rolling down this canyon drive  
With your laughter in my head  
I'm gonna have to block it out somehow to survive  
'cause those dreams are dead  
And I'm alive  
  
I want to go where I will never hear your name  
I want to lose my sorrow and be free again  
And I know I've been insane  
When I think of places I could have been  
  
But I was dreaming of you  
With my heart in your hands  
And I was following through  
With my beautiful plans  
  
Standing here by the highway side  
Watching these trucks blow by  
Inches from my face  
Yeah thinking 'bout the time I've wasted  
And the pleasure we once tasted  
Looking up and down this road  
I've been here before  
Can't be here no more  
  
Yeah now I'm rolling down California five  
With your laughter in my head  
I'm gonna have to block it out somehow to survive  
'cause those dreams are dead  
And I'm alive

Baby, I'm around you enough to know when you're coming down  
And I am there with a smile, prepared to bring you around  
You're thinking that you've got me trained  
I'm aware of that  
  
But when you need your outlook changed  
Baby, I'm the cat  
Baby, I'm allowed to be late when I'm coming home  
You know I'll be there when I want to  
  
And you let me roam  
You think you've got me figured out  
I don't know about that  
But when you want to twist and shout  
  
Baby, I'm the cat  
Baby, I might not be all that  
Your fortune cookie promised you  
But I will do  
  
I'm the cat  
Baby I . . . Baby I'm the cat  
Oh yeah . . . Baby I'm the cat  
Baby, I'm in love with the way you scratch my back  
  
You've got the only thing I want  
And that's a fact  
And when sometimes we disagree  
You take me to the mat  
  
But when I get you spinning free  
Baby I'm the cat  
Baby, I might not be all that  
The gypsy woman prophesied  
  
But be advised  
I'm the cat  
Baby I might not be all that  
Your Magic 8 Ball said I'd be  
  
But you will see  
I'm the cat  
Baby I... Baby I'm the cat  
Oh yeah... Baby I'm the cat

It was a ruby that she wore  
On a chain around her neck  
In the shape of a heart  
In the shape of a heart  
It was a time I won't forget  
For the sorrow and regret  
And the shape of a heart  
And the shape of a heart  
I guess I never knew  
What she was talking about  
I guess I never knew  
What she was living without  
People speak of love don't know what they're thinking of  
Wait around for the one who fits just like a glove  
Speak in terms of belief and belonging  
Try to fit some name to their longing  
There was a hole left in the wall  
From some ancient fight  
About the size of a fist  
Or something thrown that had missed  
And there were other holes as well  
In the house where our nights fell  
Far too many to repair  
In the time that we were there  
People speak of love don't know what they're thinking of  
Reach out to each other though the push and shove  
Speak in terms of a life and the learning  
Try to think of a word for the burning  
You keep it up  
You try so hard  
To keep a life from coming apart  
And never know  
What breaches and faults are concealed  
In the shape of a heart  
It was the ruby that she wore  
On a stand beside the bed  
In the hour before dawn  
When I knew she was gone  
And I held it in my hand  
For a little while  
And dropped it into the wall  
Let it go, heard it fall  
I... I guess I never knew  
What she was talking about  
I guess I never knew  
What she was living without  
People speak of love don't know what they're thinking of  
Wait around for the one who fits just like a glove  
Speak in terms of a life and the living  
Try to find the word for forgiving  
You keep it up  
You try so hard  
To keep a life from coming apart  
And never know  
The shallows and the unseen reefs  
That are there from the start  
In the shape of a heart

Give us twenty minutes and we'll give you the world  
We bring good things to life  
The news you need from people you can count on  
Doing what we do best  
  
The heartbeat of America  
Your true voice  
You're in good hands  
Now more than ever before  
  
And in the flickering light and the comforting glow  
You get the world every night as a TV show  
The latest spin on the shit we're in, blow by blow  
And the more you watch, the less you know  
  
Beyond the hundred million darkened living rooms  
Out where the human ocean roars  
Into the failing light, the generations go  
Heading for the information wars  
  
Do people really spend millions upon millions  
To make us think we care about the planet  
At the same time polluting and looting the only world we've got  
So they can maximize their profit?  
People do.  
  
The heartbeat of America  
Your true voice  
For the life of your business  
It's everywhere you want to be  
  
And there's a front row seat for the precious few  
The latest war as a pay-per-view  
Famine and disaster right in front of you  
And the more you watch, the less you do  
  
Beyond the hundred million darkened living rooms  
Out where the human ocean roars  
Into the failing light, the generations go  
Heading for the information wars

They shot a man into the sky  
The moon and stars became his bed  
He saw the sun rise seven times  
And when he came back down he said  
  
It is one, it is one  
One world spinning 'round the sun  
Wherever it is you call home  
Whatever country you come from  
It is one, it is one, it is one, it is one  
  
They shot a man if Africa  
At a time of rivalry and war  
He had some dreams of a good life  
But dreams aren't what they killed him for  
  
Now people stand themselves next to the righteous  
And they believe the things they say are true  
They speak in terms of what divides us  
To justify the violence they do  
  
But it is one, it is one  
One world spinning 'round the sun  
Wherever it is you call home  
Whatever country you come from  
It is one, it is one, it is one, it is one  
One, the deep blue ocean  
One, the endless sky  
One, the purple mountains  
One, you and I  
  
It's not a world of our own choosing  
We don't decide where we are born  
This life is a battleground between right and wrong  
One way or other we are torn  
  
And people stand themselves next to the righteous  
And they believe the things they say are true  
And speak in terms of what divides us  
To justify the violence they do  
  
But it is one, it is one  
One world spinning 'round the sun  
Wherever it is you call home  
Whatever country you come from  
It is one, it is one, it is one, it is one  
It is one, it is one, it is one, it is one  
One, the deep blue ocean  
One, the endless sky  
One, the purple mountains  
One, you and I

It's been raining here in long beach  
The dampness in the air  
Tends to straighten out my hair  
Against my wishes  
But the traces of a song reach  
My tattered ear once more  
Lend me courage to ignore  
The smell of fishes  
  
I was a drunken lout, I ran about  
With ladies that I knew  
I did 'em wrong all night long  
Singing 23 skidoo  
  
Huzahh...huzahh...  
Once upon a time I was a kid  
Well I don't know what happened then  
But I'm warning all you younger men  
On your way to long beach think again  
You can't afford to settle down in long beach  
  
I had a rack and coat, a paddle boat  
I played the ukelele  
Beneath the moon in june I'd croon  
Won't you come on home little baby  
  
Huzahh...huzahh...  
Once upon a time I was a kid  
But now my hair is turning gray  
I'm getting fatter every day  
If you got any sense you'll stay away  
And never give another thought to long beach  
And never give a moment's thought to long beach

Jamaica was the lovely one, I played her well  
As we lay in the tall grass where the shadows fell  
Hiding from the children so they would not tell  
We would stay there 'till her sister rang the evening bell  
  
Jamaica, say you will  
Help me find a way to fill these empty hours  
Say you will come again tomorrow  
  
The daughter of a captain on the rolling seas  
She would stare across the water from the trees  
Last time he was home he held her on his knees  
And said the next time they would sail away just where they pleased  
  
Jamaica, say you will  
Help me find a way to fill these lifeless sails  
And stay until my ships can find the sea  
  
Jamaica was a sweet young one, I loved her true  
She was a comfort and a mercy through and through  
Hiding from this world together, next thing I knew  
We had brought her things down to the bay -- what could I do  
  
Jamaica, say you will  
Help me find a way to fill these sails  
And we will sail until our waters have run dry

(Jackson Browne)  
  
[Unreleased Jackson Browne song, sung in concert a few times]  
  
It wasn't me at your window, Baby.  
It wasn't me at your door.  
It must have been some other fool  
With his heart in his hand,  
Coming back for more.  
  
I was there when you closed your eyes.  
But it wasn't me when you came.  
I just thought I heard you call my name.  
  
You were there when I needed someone  
With your warmth and your style.  
I was back in the world again  
And it was real for awhile.  
  
I was ready for love to be coming,  
But not for what love became,  
And I thought I heard you call my name.  
  
Call my name.  
Now there was something only we knew together  
Far too simple to explain.  
Love smiled on us just like forever.  
  
You're always leaving town.  
First you come around.  
Then you can't be found  
It always brings me down.  
  
There's nothing wrong with my heart, Baby.  
There's nothing wrong with the world.  
If a girl don't feel the same way I feel,  
There's nothing wrong with the girl.  
  
Maybe we were too different to love each other.  
Maybe too much the same.  
Anyway, I thought I heard you call my name.  
  
Call my name.  
Like you were drifting away down the river.  
All my voices and curses in the pain  
Love flows on just like forever.  
  
You're always leaving town.  
First you come around.  
Then you can't be found  
And it always brings me down.  
  
Da da da da da  
Da da da dum dum dum  
Da da da  
Ohhhh no no no no no no  
Na na na na na  
  
Just like forever.  
Da da da da da  
Just like forever.  
Just like forever

I've been waiting for something to happen  
For a week or a month or a year  
With the blood in the ink of the headlines  
And the sound of the crowd in my ear  
  
You might ask what it takes to remember  
When you know that you've seen it before  
Where a government lies to a people  
And a country is drifting to war  
  
There's a shadow on the faces  
Of the men who send the guns  
To the wars that are fought in places  
Where their business interests run  
  
On the radio talk shows and TV  
You hear one thing again and again  
How the USA stands for freedom  
And we come to the aid of a friend  
But who are the ones that we call our friends?  
These governments killing their own?  
Or the people who finally can't take anymore  
And they pick up a gun or a brick or a stone  
  
And there are lives in the balance  
There are people under fire  
There are children at the cannons  
And there is blood on the wire  
  
There's a shadow on the faces  
Of the men who fan the flames  
Of the wars that are fought in places  
Where we can't even say the names  
  
They sell us the president the same way  
They sell us our clothes and our cars  
They sell us everything from youth to religion  
The same time they sell us our wars  
  
I want to know who the men in the shadows are  
I want to hear somebody asking them why  
They can be counted on to tell us who our enemies are  
But they're never the ones to fight or to die  
  
And there are lives in the balance  
There are people under fire  
There are children at the cannons  
And there is blood on the wire

Standing in the ocean with the sun burning low in the west  
Like a fire in the cavernous darkness at the heart of the beast  
With my beliefs and possessions, stopped at the frontier in my chest  
At the edge of my country, my back to the sea, looking east  
  
Where the search for the truth is conducted with a wink and a nod  
And where power and position are equated with the grace of God  
These times are famine for the soul while for the senses it's a feast  
From the edge of my country, as far as you see, looking east  
  
Hunger in the midnight, hunger at the stroke of noon  
Hunger in the mansion, hunger in the rented room  
Hunger on the TV, hunger on the printed page  
And there's a God-sized hunger underneath the laughing and the rage  
In the absence of light  
And the deepening night  
Where I wait for the sun  
Looking east  
  
How long have I left my mind to the powers that be?  
How long will it take to find the higher power moving in me?  
  
Power in the insect  
Power in the sea  
Power in the snow falling silently  
Power in the blossom  
Power in the stone  
Power in the song being sung alone  
Power in the wheat field  
Power in the rain  
Power in the sunlight and the hurricane  
Power in the silence  
Power in the flame  
Power in the sound of the lover's name  
The power of the sunrise and the power of a prayer released  
On the edge of my country, I pray for the ones with the least  
  
Hunger in the midnight, hunger at the stroke of noon  
Hunger in the banquet, hunger in the bride and groom  
Hunger on the TV, hunger on the printed page  
And there's a God-sized hunger underneath the questions of the age  
And an absence of light  
In the deepening night  
Where I wait for the sun  
Looking east

Lovely, lovely, did you see me  
Just as I was crying  
Love me lovely, make it easy  
What I say is hard but I am trying  
  
Lovely, lovely, can you hear me  
Listen to my singing  
Love me lovely, while you're near me  
Try and understand the thought I'm bringing  
  
Last night I was sleeping  
But I did not know if I'd awaken today  
Lie in my keeping, only know  
That I can't stay after today  
I'm on my way - love me lovely  
Love me lovely  
  
Lovely, lovely, you can't fool me  
I know that you need me  
Love me, lovely, now and truly  
Knowing that your love can only speed me  
  
Don't say how it could be  
Or I'll know that you'll be crying today  
Just how it should be I don't know  
So this I'll say  
I'm on my way - love me lovely  
Love me lovely  
  
Last night I was sleeping  
But I did not know if I'd awaken today  
Lie in my keeping, only know  
That I can't stay after today  
I'm on my way - love me lovely  
Love me lovely

Maybe the hardest thing I've ever done  
Was to walk away from you  
Leaving behind the life that we'd begun  
I split myself in two  
  
Proud and alone, cold as a stone  
Rolling down that hill into the night  
I could see the surprise and the hurt in your eyes  
From behind each flashing city light  
  
Love needs a heart and I need to find  
If loves needs a heart like mine  
  
Love won't come near me, she don't even hear me  
She walks past my vacancy sign  
Love needs a heart, trusting and blind  
I wish that heart was mine  
  
Proud and alone, cold as a stone  
I'm afraid to believe the things I feel  
I can cry with the best I can laugh with the rest  
But I'm never sure when it's real  
And it may be the hardest thing I've ever done  
But apart from all that I hope to find  
Where's the heart that's been looking for mine?  
I hope it finds me in time  
  
Love needs a heart and I need to find  
If love needs a heart like mine

Marianne, marianne  
With your voice like silver strings ringing  
And sounds of laughter and singing  
Keep repeating, marianne, marianne  
  
Marianne, marianne  
Oh I can tell better than anyone else could  
That there's more to you than just bad or good  
There's a teardrop or a shaft of light for your heart  
  
Marianne, oh, marianne  
The dawn will be breaking soon  
And my voice will fade with the moon  
And the sunlight will remind me of you

Melissa, I knew I just had to kiss ya  
Heaven knows what I had in mind  
When my eyes went blind  
And you had to take me home  
Because I could not find my way  
  
Mimi, you make my glasses steamy  
Heaven knows that I'll take a chance  
On a girl from france  
Just so long as we don't have to dance 'till dawn  
  
Maybe baby I'm not so smart  
But I know I'm not your brother  
And the way you affect me  
You needn't suspect me  
Of falling in love with another  
  
Daisy, your old man thinks I'm crazy  
Heaven knows I used to go insane  
When I heard your name  
I knew what I was doin'  
When I had my brain removed  
  
Maybe baby I'm not so smart  
I never claimed to be a thinker  
But you gotta respect me  
Cause the way you affect me  
I'll never have to be a drinker  
  
Bessie, my dreams of you are messy  
Heaven knows I used to lie awake  
And try to make my heart stop pounding  
Long enough to take my rest

I got my head down between my knees  
I got my back against this bedroom wall  
I hear my voice saying baby please  
But I know you don't hear me call  
  
You're staring at that far horizon  
I don't even know why you stay  
It's like you're already miles and miles away  
  
We got this life so far turned around  
We only talk about what happened last  
We try to move ahead but we're losing ground  
To the heartache and the pain of the past  
  
Staring at that far horizon  
I don't even know why I stay  
You're already miles and miles away.  
  
Miles Away  
From these sad deliberations  
From a life in disarray  
And all these recriminations  
And these stones all in your passway  
  
You got this rage choking up your voice  
And you're behaving like an orphan child  
I want to be your friend but I got no choice  
Than to fight when you're so mean and wild  
  
Staring at that far horizon  
I don't even know why you stay  
It's like you're already miles and miles away  
  
Miles Away  
From these sad deliberations  
From the innocence betrayed  
The abandoned expectations  
And the stones that we have laid

(english translation by jorge calderon)  
My personal revenge will be the right  
Of our children in the schools and in the gardens  
My personal revenge will be to give you  
This song which has flourished without panic  
My personal revenge will be to show you  
The kindness in the eyes of my people  
Who have always fought relentlessly in battle  
And been generous and firm in victory  
My personal revenge will be to tell you good morning  
On a street without beggars or homeless  
When instead of jailing you I suggest  
You shake away the sadness there that blinds you  
And when you who have applied your hands in torture  
Are unable to look up at what surrounds you  
My personal revenge will be to give you  
These hands that once you so mistreated  
But have failed to take away their tenderness  
It was the people who hated you the most  
When rage became the language of their song  
And underneath the skin of this town today  
Its heart has been scarred forevermore  
It was the people who hated you the most  
When rage became the language of their song  
And underneath the skin of this town today  
Its heart has been scarred forevermore  
And underneath the skin of this town today  
Red and black, it's heart's been scarred  
Forevermore  

What with all my expectations long abandoned  
And a future I no longer saw my hand in  
How I found you is beyond my understanding  
My stunning mystery companion  
  
I know that you don't want to be  
Out here forever on this road  
Or live among the boxes  
Where all my past lives have been stowed  
Maybe you're thinking of someplace  
With a garden by the sea  
Where we could slow down  
And you could put a little more work in on me  
  
What with all my expectations long abandoned  
My solitary nature notwithstanding  
You're the one who pulled me  
Out of that crash landing  
My stunning mystery companion  
  
Right now I can't quite remember  
The cause of all my tears  
I hear you laughing and somehow  
The past just disappears  
Maybe you were joking when you said  
You'd take me for ten years and no more  
Maybe you've had the best of me  
But you could take another ten years and be sure  
  
What with all my expectations long abandoned  
And a life that just gets more and more demanding  
There's no doubt that you're the reason I'm still standing  
My stunning mystery companion

There are times when I see you, baby  
Looking back the way we came  
Through some hard places, choices we made  
You never held me to blame  
But you had some dreams when you were a girl  
Some ideas about the world  
And you see how some things will never be the same  
(And how some things never change)  
  
And I remember how you helped me, baby  
And all the times you had my back  
And how you wrapped me in your sweetness  
And held my eyes with your eyes  
When my train was off the track  
Now I've got some things that I want to do  
And I want to do them with you  
If you'll just stand by me, and don't look back  
  
And never stop coming up with all of that love for me  
Never stop coming with your faith in what a love can be  
Never stop coming up with all of that love  
Keep on rising above  
And never stop coming up on the world love wants to see  
  
And the world has been showing you how  
It's no place for your tender heart now  
In a world that keeps turning you down  
Only the heart knows where the strength can be found  
  
Never stop coming up with all of that love for me  
Never stop coming with your faith in what a love can be  
Never stop coming up with all of that love  
Keep on rising above  
And never stop coming up on the world love wants to see  
  
Remember when you look into my eyes  
I'm the one who took you by surprise  
The time has come and gone and come back 'round again  
And I'm still here to take you by surprise my friend  
  
Show me your eyes, tell me again  
Where you want to go  
Now the night is glowing beneath your skin  
And when you smile I'm the richest man I know

(Jackson Browne)

I'm hanging on to my peace of mind  
I just don't know  
I'm hanging on to those good times, baby  
Just want to let them roll  
I'm gonna make it to the light and joy  
I'll tell you why  
I got a woman who can take me there  
The apple of my eye  
Oh, I just don't know, no no, no, no  
I love her so  
Don't let me see that morning paper  
Cause I don't need those dues  
It's just the same old murder movie  
But they call it the news  
I'll tell you what would be some story  
And what would set me free  
Is if the same thing happened to everybody  
That just happened to me, oh,  
I just don't know, no, no, no, no  
I'll never let her go  
Every time I hear somebody sneakin'  
Up behind whoa, I turn around  
But I still hear that sound  
And just when I'm about to lose my mind  
Here comes my baby  
Singing like a nightingale  
Coming my way down along that devastation  
Trail well tell the Lord above  
She's got a brand of love  
That cannot fail  
I'm hanging on to my peace of mind  
That's no lie  
I'm hanging on to my special friend  
The apple of my eye  
My inspiration, too  
She's got a lead on my heart and  
My soul and she knows just what to do  
Oh, I just don't know, no, no, no, no  
No, I get so low, and my mind's about to go  
But wait a minute, here comes my baby  
Singing like a nightingale  
Coming my way down along that devastation trail  
Well, let the fires burn, let the  
Floods return  
We will prevail  
Hanging on to my peace of mind  
I just don't know

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
You really need someone on your side  
But you run away and hide  
Whenever somebody's gonna get through  
You've got this wall in front of you  
You put your arm around me and smile  
But you're thinking all the while  
Yeah, your friends only go so far  
However close friends think they are  
On the day  
On the day you fall in love  
Gonna pray  
You're gonna pray that your love is enough  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
You've had the world in the palm of your hand  
Since you turned from child to man  
No one can tell you a thing you don't know  
You see your life as a one man show  
But you're not whole  
There are things you don't control  
You're gonna know what I'm talking about  
On the day love finds you out  
On the day  
On the day you fall in love  
Gonna pray  
You better pray  
It's your life, you try to know  
Which way the answers lie, which way to go  
'Cause you survive, don't mean you grow  
Open your eyes, look out below, look out  
On the day  
On the day you fall in love  
Gonna pray  
You better pray, yeah  
On the day  
On the day you fall in love  
Gonna pray  
You better  

Someone's going to have to explain it to me  
I'm not sure what it means  
My baby's feeling funny in the morning  
She's having trouble getting into her jeans  
Her waist-line seems to be expanding  
Although she never feels like eating a thing  
I guess we'll reach some understanding  
When we see what the future will bring  
  
I met her in a crowded barroom  
One of those typical Hollywood scenes  
I was doing my very best Bogart  
But I was having trouble getting into her jeans  
I punched an unemployed actor  
Defending her dignity  
He stood up and knocked me through that barroom door  
And that girl came home with me  
  
Now baby's feeling funny in the morning  
She says she's got a lot on her mind  
Nature didn't give her any warning  
Now she's going to have to leave her wild ways behind  
She says she doesn't care if she never spends  
Another night running loose on the town  
She's gonna be a mother  
Take a look in my eyes and tell me brother  
If I look like I'm ready  
  
I told her I had always lived alone  
And I probably always would  
And all I wanted was my freedom  
And she told me that she understood  
But I let her do some of my laundry  
And she slipped a few meals in between  
And the next thing I remember, she was all moved in  
And I was buying her a washing machine  
  
My baby's feeling funny in the morning  
She says she's got a lot on her mind  
Nature didn't give her any warning  
But she's feeling better about it all the time  
She says she's ready for some meaning  
After all of her running around  
Well bless my soul, she's got a rock-and-roll band man  
Thinking 'bout settling down

Pretty little one  
How has it all begun?  
They're teaching you how to walk  
But you're already on the run  
Little one...  
What you gonna do?  
Little one...  
Honey, it's all up to you  
  
Now your daddy's in the den shootin' up the evening news  
Mama's with a friend, lately she's been so confused  
Little one...  
Come on and take my hand  
I may not have the answer but I believe I got a plan  
  
Honey you shake and I'll rattle and we'll roll on down the line  
And see if we can't get in touch with a very close friend of mine  
But let me clue you in, it ain't like him  
To argue or pretend...  
Honey let me introduce you to my redneck friend  
  
Well they've got a little list of all those things of which they don't approve  
They've got to keep their eyes on you or you might make your move  
Little one...  
I really wish you would  
Little one...  
I think the damage would do you good  
  
Honey you shake and I'll rattle and we'll roll on down the line  
We're going to forget all about the battle  
It's gonna feel so fine  
'Cause he's the missing link, the kitchen sink  
Eleven on a scale of ten  
Honey let me introduce you to my redneck friend  
  
Honey you shake and I'll rattle and we'll roll on down the line  
I'm going to try to swing you up into my saddle  
And then we'll run but you'll think we're flyin'  
Now honey don't just stand there  
Lookin' like this dream will never end  
Honey let me introduce you to my redneck friend

Oh people, look around you  
The signs are everywhere  
You've left it for somebody other than you  
To be the one to care  
You're lost inside your houses  
There's no time to find you now  
Your walls are burning  
And your towers are turning  
I'm going to leave you here  
And try to get down to the sea somehow  
  
The road is filled with homeless souls  
Every woman, child and man  
Who have no idea where they will go  
But they'll help you if they can  
Now everyone must have some thought  
That's going to pull them through somehow  
Well the fires are raging hotter and hotter  
But the sisters of the sun are going  
To rock me on the water now  
  
Rock me on the water  
Sister will you soothe my fevered brow  
Rock me on the water  
I'll get down to the sea somehow  
  
Oh people, look among you  
It's there your hope must lie  
There's a sea bird above you  
Gliding in one place like Jesus in the sky  
We all must do the best we can  
And then hang on to that Gospel plow  
When my life is over, I'm going  
To stand before the Father  
But the sisters of the sun are going  
To rock me on the water now  
  
Rock me on the water  
Sister will you soothe my fevered brow  
Rock me on the water, maybe I'll remember  
Maybe I'll remember how  
Rock me on the water  
The wind is with me now  
So rock me on the water  
I'll get down to the sea somehow

She was standing at the load-in  
When the trucks rolled up  
She was sniffin' all around  
Like a half-grown female pup  
She wasn't hard to talk to  
Looked like she had nowhere to go  
So I gave her a pass  
So she could get in and see the show  
Well, I sat her down right next to me  
And I got her a beer  
While I mixed that sound on the stage  
So the band could hear  
The more I watched her watch them play  
The less I thought of to say  
And when they walked off stage  
You know, the drummer swept that girl away  
  
But Rosie, you're all right  
(You wear my ring)  
When you hold me tight  
(Rosie, that's my thing)  
When you turn out the light  
(I got to hand it to me)  
Looks like it's me and you again tonight, Rosie  
  
Well I guess I might have known from the start  
She'd come for a star  
Well I told my imagination not to run too far  
Of all the times that I've been burned  
By now you think I'd've learned  
That it's who you look like,  
Not who you are  
(You all keep that in mind)  
  
Rosie, you're all right  
(You wear my ring)  
When you hold me tight  
(Rosie, that's my thing)  
When you turn out the light  
(I got to hand it to me)  
It looks like it's me and you again tonight, Rosie  
It looks like it's me and you again tonight,  
It looks like it's me and you again tonight, Rosie  
Rosie, Rosie, Rosie, Rosie

I meant to call her name  
I meant to take her hand  
I meant to be the same and understand  
Just what was happening in the evening  
Between the princess and the prince  
  
I can't be bothered now  
And I can't eat or drink  
I can't remember how I used to think  
What was the song she sang before the morning rang  
Bringing the princess to the prince  
  
It's a crystal ringing way  
She has about her in the day  
But she's a laughing dappled shadow  
She's a laughing dappled shadow in my night  
  
If I could hear her voice  
If I could see her face  
If I could have my choice I'd be in the place  
Where I saw her last on the evening past  
Of the princess and the prince  
  
It's a crystal ringing way  
She has about her in the day  
But she's a laughing dappled shadow  
She's a laughing dappled shadow in my night

I've witnessed those one night stands  
Must have played in a thousand bands  
But I'm just here tonight, tomorrow I'll be gone  
Seen folks show their blacker sides  
Seen them die just for foolish pride  
And those drivers always ask to hear that same old song  
That's a big ten-four  
From your back door  
Just put that hammer down  
This young man feels  
Those eighteen wheels  
That keep turning 'round to take me down to shaky town  
I've heard all those hard luck tales  
From all of you u.s. males  
I've heard you tell those lies about the love you've know  
And I've followed those highway signs  
And I've run down those thin white lines  
Like those drivers this old road is all I call my own  
That's a big ten-four  
From your back door  
Just put that hammer down  
This young man feels  
Those eighteen wheels  
That keep turning 'round to take me down to shaky town  

Sing my songs to me  
Sing them to me softly  
Sing me sunlight and shadows  
Orange groves and meadows  
Let your voice ring back my memories  
Sing my songs to me  
  
Bring my dreams to me  
Bring them from the darkness  
Let the minutes and hours  
Show my mind strange new flowers  
But I'd like to know where they go  
when the morning comes  
Bring my dreams to me  
  
Because it seems to me  
That there may never be  
A better chance to see who I am  
Come timelessly dancing  
Through my dreams to me

In the calling out to one another  
Of the lovers up and down the strand  
In the sound of the waves and the cries  
Of the seagulls circling the sand  
  
In the fragments of the songs  
Carried down the wind from some radio  
In the murmuring of the city in the distance  
Ominous and low  
  
I hear the sound of the world where we played  
And the far too simple beauty  
Of the promises we made  
  
If you ever need holding  
Call my name, I'll be there  
If you ever need holding  
And no holding back, I'll see you through  
Sky blue and black  
  
Where the touch of the lover ends  
And the soul of the friend begins  
There's a need to be separate and a need to be one  
And a struggle neither wins  
  
Where you gave me the world I was in  
And a place I could make a stand  
I could never see how you doubted me  
When I'd let go of your hand  
  
Yeah, and I was much younger then  
And I must have thought that I would know  
If things were going to end  
  
And the heavens were rolling  
Like a wheel on a track  
And our sky was unfolding  
And it'll never fold back  
Sky blue and black  
  
And I'd have fought the world for you  
If I thought that you wanted me to  
Or put aside what was true or untrue  
If I'd know that's what you needed  
What you needed me to do  
  
But the moment has passed by me now  
To have put away my pride  
And just come through for you somehow  
  
If you ever need holding  
Call my name, I'll be there  
If you ever need holding  
And no holding back, I'll see you through  
  
You're the color of the sky  
Reflected in each store-front window pane  
You're the whispering and the sighing  
Of my tires in the rain  
  
You're the hidden cost and the thing that's lost  
In everything I do  
Yeah and I'll never stop looking for you  
In the sunlight and the shadows  
  
And the faces on the avenue  
That's the way love is  
That's the way love is  
That's the way love is  
Sky blue and black

God is great, God is good  
He guards your neighborhood  
Though it's generally understood  
Not quite the way you would  
You try to take the slack  
Stay awake and watch His back  
But something happens every now and then  
And someone breaks into the promised land  
Ah, boy, boy  
This world is not your toy  
This world is long on hunger  
This world is short on joy  
A E I O  
You speak as if you know  
What's good for everyone  
What's good in what you've done?  
What's good about a world in which  
War rages at a fever pitch?  
And people die for the little things  
A little corn, a little beans  
Ah, boy, boy  
This world is not your toy  
This world is, this world is  
Long on hunger, short on joy  
How much longer  
You gonna keep the world hungry, boy?  
You measure peace with guns  
Progress in mega-tons  
Who's left when the war is won?  
Soldier of misfortune  
Soldier of an angry call  
Soldier on foreign soil  
I'm not here to fight your war  
I know what you're fighting for  
Ah, boy, boy  
This world is not your toy  
This world is, this world is  
Long on hunger, short on joy  
How much longer  
You gonna keep the world hungry, boy?  

Every day I walk out in this torn up world  
And I fight to survive  
I'm laughing when I make it to the Saturday  
And I'm alive  
Carrying your smile with me  
Carrying your smile with me  
  
Everywhere I look I see this world slippin' down  
That low road, day by day  
And I just go on working for the things I need  
And making my own way  
Carrying your smile with me, oh yea  
Carrying your smile with me  
  
Take a walk on the troubled side of this old town  
Take a walk on the broken streets and the buildings falling down  
Look at all these kids with nothing but trouble in their eyes  
Trouble in their future, trouble in their lives  
  
Some bridges are falling down  
Some bridges are still around  
  
Take a walk on the shaded uptown avenue  
Some people are doing well no matter how they do  
And I know there's more to life than what you own  
But I see so many good things, things I've never known  
  
Some bridges are falling down  
Some bridges are still around  
  
Every night I listen to the sound of the street  
Lying in my bed  
I love to see the dreams that are dancing there  
In the light above your head  
And sometimes I get so weary  
And when hope is caving in  
You fill me with your love and your laughter, baby  
Until I get back up again  
  
Carrying your smile with me  
(Take a walk on the streets of this divided town)  
Carrying your smile with me  
(Take a walk on the smoking edge of the battleground)  
Carrying your smile with me  
(Take a look at the situation, the poverty and the desperation)  
(Take the time for the realization)  
Everyday I'm carrying your smile with me  
(Take a walk in the daylight)  
Carrying your smile with me  
(Some bridges are falling down)  
Carrying your smile with me  
(Some bridges are still around)

Though Adam was a friend of mine,  
I did not know him well  
He was alone into his distance  
He was deep into his well  
I could guess what he was laughing at,  
But I couldn't really tell  
Now the story's told that Adam jumped,  
But I've been thinking that he fell  
  
Together we went traveling,  
As we received the call  
His destination India,  
And I had none at all  
Well, I still remember laughing  
With our backs against the wall  
So free of fear, we never thought  
That one of us might fall  
  
I sit before my only candle,  
But it's so little light to find my way  
Now this story unfolds before my candle  
Which is shorter every hour  
As it reaches for the day  
But I feel just like a candle in the way  
I guess I'll get there, but  
I wouldn't say for sure  
  
When we parted we were laughing still,  
As our goodbyes were said  
And I never heard from him again  
As each our lives we led  
Except for once in someone else's  
Letter that I read  
Until I heard the sudden word  
That a friend of mine was dead  
  
I sit before my only candle,  
Like a pilgrim sits beside the way  
Now this journey appears before my candle  
As a song that's growing fainter  
The harder that I play  
But I fear before I end I'll fade away  
But I guess I'll get there,  
Though I wouldn't say for sure  
  
Though Adam was a friend of mine,  
I did not know him long  
And when I stood myself beside him,  
I never though I was as strong  
Still it seems he stopped his singing  
In the middle of his song  
Well I'm not the one to say I know,  
But I'm hoping he was wrong  
  
I'm holding out my only candle,  
Though it's so little light to find my way  
Now this story's been laid beneath my candle  
And it's shorter every hour  
As it reaches for the day  
Yes, I feel just like a candle in the way  
I hope I'll get there,  
But I never pray

It used to be there were two sets of footprints in the sand  
And there were two silhouettes in the sunset hand in hand  
But now here beside the sea are the footprints of three  
And I can't find my own  
Among the directions they're all going  
  
Baby it's alright  
Break this chain of love and madness  
It's alright  
Take this rain as your new address  
  
It's alright  
Take this rain  
It's alright  
Take this rain  
  
'Cause I've been running all over creation out of my mind  
Trying to keep our hearts beating together all of the time  
Going crazier every day  
Watching our love slipping away  
  
'Cause you're the only home I've ever wanted  
And the only light I've known  
  
But baby it's alright  
Break this chain of love and madness  
It's alright  
Take this rain as your new address  
  
It's alright  
Take this rain  
It's alright  
Take this rain  
You're going to be free  
  
Some people go through life seeing just what they want to see  
Take the way I went on believing  
You might still believe in me  
And I still want the love I always thought our love could be  
But some things can't be changed  
Take this rain  
  
You're going to hear my voice in the morning calling your name  
And know my love and my desperation were one and the same  
And where our footprints used to be  
There'll be nothing but the sea  
And the tide and the wind and the open sky  
And the unbroken horizon  
  
Baby it's alright  
Break this chain of love and madness  
It's alright  
Take this pain and all this sadness  
  
It's alright  
Make this rain into your fortress  
It's alright  
Take this rain  
  
It's alright  
Take this rain  
It's alright  
Take this rain  
You're going to be free

Between the darkness on the street  
And the houses filling up with light  
Between the stillness in my heart  
And the roar of the approaching night  
Somebody's calling after somebody  
Somebody turns the corner out of sight  
Looking for somebody  
Somewhere in the night  
Tender is the night  
When you hold your baby tight  
Tender are the motions, tender is the night  
Between a life that we expected  
And the way it's always been  
I can't walk back in again  
After the way we fight  
When just outside there are people laughing  
Living lives we used to lead  
Chasing down the love they need  
Somewhere in the night  
Tender is the night  
And the benediction of the neon light  
Tender are the hunters, tender is the night  
You're gonna want me tonight  
When you're ready to surrender  
Forget about who's right  
When you're ready to remember  
It's another world at night  
When you're ready to be tender  
Tender, tender tender  
And in the hard light of an angry sun  
No one remembers what was said or done  
Tender are the words they choose  
You win, I win, we lose  
Tender  
Tender is the night  
Tender  
The benediction of the neon light  
Tender  
Tender are the hunters  
Tender is the night  
When they hold each other tight  
Tender  
Tender are the undercover  
Tender  
The stranger and the secret lover  
Tender  
Tender are the motions  
Tender is the night  
When you hold your baby tight  
Tender, tender tender

She was a friend to me when I needed one  
Wasn't for her I don't know what I'd done  
She gave me back something that was missing in me  
She could of turned out to be almost anyone  
Almost anyone  
With the possible exception  
Of who I wanted her to be  
Running into the midnight  
With her clothes whipping in the wind  
Reaching into the heart of the darkness  
For the tenderness within  
Stumblin' into the lights of the city  
And then back in the shadows again  
Hanging onto the laughter  
That each of us hid our unhappiness in  
Talk about celestial bodies  
And your angels on the wing  
She wasn't much good at stickin' around but  
She could sing.  
In the dead of night  
She could shine a light  
On some places that you've never been  
In that kind of light  
You could lose your sight  
And believe there was something to win  
You could hold her tight  
With all your might  
But she'd slip through your arms like the wind  
And be back in flight  
Back into the night  
Where you might never see her again  
The longer I thought I could find her  
The shorter my vision became  
Running in circles behind her  
And thinking in terms of the blame  
But she couldn't have been any kinder  
If she'd come back and tried to explain  
She wasn't much good at saying goodbye--but  
That girl was sane

Now that it's time  
Now that the hour hand has landed at the end  
Now that it's real  
Now that the dreams have given all they had to lend  
I want to know  
Do I stay or do I go  
And maybe try another time  
And do I really have a hand in my forgetting  
  
Now that I've tried  
Now that I've finally found that this is not the way  
Now that I turn  
Now that I feel it's time to spend the night away  
I want to know  
Do I stay or do I go  
And maybe finally split the rind  
And do I really understand the undernetting  
  
Yes and the morning has me looking in your eyes and seeing mine  
Warning me to read the signs carefully  
  
Now that it's love  
Now that the candle's falling smaller in my mind  
Now that it's here  
Now that I'm almost not so very far behind  
I want to know  
Do I stay or do I go  
And maybe fall another side  
And do I really have a sound that I can ride on  
  
Now that I can  
Now that it's easy ever easy all around  
Now that I'm near  
Now that I'm falling to the sunlights and to song  
I want to know  
Do I stay or do I go  
And do I have to do just one  
And can I choose again if I should lose the reason  
  
Yes and the morning has me looking in your eyes and seeing mine  
Warning me to read the signs oh carefully  
  
Now that I smile  
Now that I'm laughing even deeper in the side  
Now that I see  
Now that I finally found the one thing I denied  
I want to know  
Do I stay or do I go  
And it is finally I decide  
That I'll be leaving in the fairest of the seasons

Everyone I've ever known has wished me well  
Anyway that's how it seems, it's hard to tell  
Maybe people only ask you how you're doing  
'Cause that's easier than letting on how little they could care  
But when you know that you've got a real friend somewhere  
Suddenly all the others are so much easier to bear  
  
Now to see things clear it's hard enough I know  
While you're waiting for reality to show  
Without dreaming of the perfect love  
And holding it so far above  
That if you stumbled onto someone real, you'd never know  
(You'd never know)  
You could be with somebody who is lonely too  
(Sometimes it doesn't show)  
He might be trying to get across to you  
(Words can be so slow)  
When your own emptiness is all that's getting through  
There comes a point when you're not sure why you're still talking  
I passed that point long ago  
(Long ago)  
Now I'm so tired of all this circling  
And all these glimpses of the end  
(You know it's useless to pretend)  
That's all the voices say:  
  
Click to learn more...  
"You'll go right on circling  
Until you've found some kind of friend"  
  
I saw you through the laughter and the noise  
You were talking with the soldiers and the boys  
While they scuffled for your weary smiles  
I thought of all the empty miles  
And the years that I've spent looking for your eyes  
(Looking for your eyes)  
And now I'm sitting here wondering what to say  
(that you might recognize)  
Afraid that all these words might scare you away  
(And break through the disguise)  
No one ever talks about their feelings anyway  
Without dressing them in dreams and laughter  
I guess it's just too painful otherwise  
  
Look  
It's like you're standing in the window  
Of a house nobody lives in  
And I'm sitting in a car across the way  
(Let's just say)  
It's an early model chevrolet  
(Let's just say)  
It's a warm and windy day  
You go and pack your sorrow  
The trash man comes tomorrow  
Leave it at the curb and we'll just roll away

I used to lay out in a field under the Milky Way  
With everything that I was feeling that I could not say  
With every doubt and every sorrow that was in my way  
Tearing around inside my head like it was there to stay  
  
Night in my eyes, the night inside me  
There where the shadows and the night could hide me  
Night in my eyes  
Sky full of stars turning over me  
Waiting for night to set me free  
  
I caught a ride into the city every chance I got  
I wasn't sure there was a name for the life I sought  
Now I'm a long way gone down the life I got  
I don't know how I believed some of the things I thought  
  
Night in my eyes, the night inside me  
Here where the shadows gather to decide me  
Night in my eyes  
Out at the end of light and gravity  
Waiting for night  
  
It takes the night to clear all of this mess away  
The obligation, the burden and the light of day  
It takes the night to fall between the world I obey  
And a world where I hear angels play  
Maybe I should go back to Spain  
  
I walk around inside the questions of my day  
I navigate the inner reaches of my disarray  
I pass the altars where fools and thieves hold sway  
I wait for night to come and lift this dread away  
  
Night in my eyes, the night inside me  
Here where the shadows and the light divide me  
Night in my eyes  
Night full of promise and uncertainty  
Waiting for night to set me free

Boy of mine  
As your fortune comes to carry you down the line  
And you watch as the changes unfold  
And you sort among the stories you've been told  
If some pieces of the picture are hard to find  
And the answers to your questions are hard to hold  
  
Take good care of your mother  
When you're making up your mind  
Should one thing or another take you from behind  
Though the world may make you hard and wild  
And determine how your life is styled  
When you've come to feel that you're the only child  
Take good care of your brother  
  
Let the disappointments pass  
Let the laughter fill your glass  
Let your illusions last until they shatter  
Whatever you might hope to find  
Among the thoughts that crowd your mind  
There won't be many that ever really matter  
  
But take good care of your mother  
And remember to be kind  
When the pain of another will serve you to remind  
That there are those who feel themselves exiled  
On whom the fortune never smiled  
And upon whose life the heartache has been piled  
They're just looking for another  
Lonely child  
  
And when you've found another soul  
Who sees into your own  
Take good care of each other

We see him dancing in the morning  
Stars depart the yawning sky  
He'll take the hour that is passing  
And leave it in his lover's eye  
And if you want he'll make it seem  
As though you're walking in his dream  
A mystic sea  
  
We hear him laughing in the shadows  
As he smuggles in the sand  
He's found another kind of color  
In the magic he has donned  
And if you want he'll take the time  
To ask the sun and moon to rhyme  
And then combine  
He draws no lines between what he's imagining

I'm going to rent myself a house  
In the shade of the freeway  
Gonna pack my lunch in the morning  
And go to work each day  
And when the evening rolls around  
I'll go on home and lay my body down  
And when the morning light comes streaming in  
I'll get up and do it again  
Amen.  
Say it again  
Amen.  
  
I want to know what became of the changes  
We waited for love to bring  
Were they only the fitful dreams  
Of some greater awakening?  
I've been aware of the time going by  
They say in the end it's the wink of an eye  
When the morning light comes streaming in  
You'll get up and do it again  
Amen.  
  
Caught between the longing for love  
And the struggle for the legal tender  
Where the sirens sing and the church bells ring  
And the junk man pounds his fender.  
Where the veterans dream of the fight  
Fast asleep at the traffic light  
And the children solemnly wait  
For the ice cream vendor  
Out into the cool of the evening  
Strolls the Pretender  
He knows that all his hopes and dreams  
Begin and end there  
  
Ah the laughter of the lovers  
As they run through the night  
Leaving nothing for the others  
But to choose off and fight  
And tear at the world with all their might  
While the ships bearing their dreams  
Sail out of sight  
  
I'm gonna find myself a girl  
Who can show me what laughter means  
And we'll fill in the missing colors  
In each other's paint-by-number dreams  
And then we'll put our dark glasses on  
And we'll make love until our strength is gone  
And when the morning light comes streaming in  
We'll get up and do it again  
Get it up again  
  
I'm gonna be a happy idiot  
And struggle for the legal tender  
Where the ads take aim and lay their claim  
To the heart and the soul of the spender  
And believe in whatever may lie  
In those things that money can buy  
Though true love could have been a contender  
Are you there?  
Say a prayer for the Pretender.  
Who started out so young and strong  
Only to surrender.  
  
Say a prayer for the pretender  
Are you there for the pretender?  
Say a prayer for the pretender  
Are you there for the pretender?  
Are you prepared for the pretender?

Original recording from the chieftain's album "the bells of dublin"  
  
All the streets are filled with laughter and light  
And the music of the season  
And the merchants' windows are all bright  
With the faces of the children  
And the families hurrying to their homes  
As the sky darkens and freezes  
Will be gathering around their hearths and tables  
Giving thanks for all god's graces  
And the birth of the rebel Jesus  
  
Well they call him by the prince of peace  
And they call him by the savior  
And they pray to him upon the seas  
And in every bold endeavor  
As they fill his churches with their pride and gold  
And their faith in him increases  
But they've turned the nature that I worship in  
From a temple to a robber's den  
In the words of the rebel Jesus  
  
We guard our world with locks and guns  
And we guard our fine possessions  
And once a year when Christmas comes  
We give to our relations  
And perhaps we give a little to the poor  
If the generosity should seize us  
But if any one of us should interfere  
In the business of why they are poor  
They get the same as the rebel jesus  
  
But please forgive me if I seem  
To take the tone of judgement  
For I've no wish to come between  
This day and your enjoyment  
In this life of hardship and of earthly toil  
We have need for anything that frees us  
So I bid you pleasure  
And I bid you cheer  
From a heathen and a pagan  
On the side of the rebel jesus.

When we come to place where the road and the sky collide  
Throw me over the edge and let my spirit glide  
They told me I was going to have to work for a living  
But all I want to do is ride  
I don't care where we're going from here  
Honey, you decide  
  
Well I spend my time at the bottom of a wishing well  
And I can hear my dreams singing clear as a bell  
I used to know where they ended and the world began  
But now it's getting hard to tell  
I could be just around the corner from heaven or a mile from hell  
  
I'm just rolling away from yesterday  
Behind a wheel of a stolen Chevrolet  
I'm going to get a little higher  
And see if I can hot-wire reality  
  
Now can you see those dark clouds gathering up ahead?  
They're going to wash this planet clean like the bible said  
Now you can hold on steady and try to be ready  
But everybody's gonna get wet  
Don't think it won't happen just because it hasn't happened yet  
  
I'm just rolling away from yesterday  
Behind the wheel of a stolen Chevrolet  
I'm going to get a little higher  
And see if I can hot-wire reality

In the time we've known  
That we each are a part of one another  
We've lost as much as we have won  
And as our lives have grown  
We have found that it only brings us pain  
That hangs on to the things that we have done  
Still I love the times you've come  
  
When you went away  
Taking all that I'd built my false road on  
I dropped my life and couldn't find the pieces  
Now you come and go  
And it's hard but I feel my strength returning  
We'll see how far this new road reaches  
We'll see a little more each time we come  
  
Now everybody's gonna tell you it's not worth it  
Everybody's gotta show you their own thing  
You might try to find your way up around it  
But the need for love will still remain  
  
Now we're lying here  
So safe in the ruins of our pleasures  
Laughter marks the place where we have fallen  
And our lives are near  
So it wouldn't occur to us to wonder  
Is this the past or the future that is calling  
  
You know I've loved these times you've come.

A man stands up before his God and country  
Raises his right hand and takes an oath  
Swears he has acted in the line of duty  
And he more than anyone wants to tell the truth  
But there is a need to keep somethings a secret  
Some weapons shipments, some private wars  
In the future democracy will be defended  
Behind closed doors  
Now the men of Congress who convene to determine  
If covert war is a business or a crime  
Are the same men who routinely give their permission  
For the shedding of blood in security's name  
And there is a need to keep some things a secret  
The names of some countries, the terms of some deals  
And above all the sound of the screams of the innocent  
Beneath our wheels  
Does the word justice mean anything to you?  
Are the features of a lie beginning to come through?  
In the streets of America the children are buried  
Caught in an avalanche of weapons and drugs  
They live and they die in the bowels of a business  
That disguised as a war between The Crips and The Bloods  
And there is a need to keep some things a secret  
The C.I.A. deals protecting the source  
And the government policies directly connecting the drugs and our wars  
Does the word justice mean anything to you?  
As the battlefield comes home and democracy falls through  
I am waiting for the time to come  
When the word will be real for everyone  
And not just a word but a thing that can be done  
Justice must be won  
Oh, oh, oh justice  
Justice  
Justice  
Oh, oh, oh justice  
Justice
