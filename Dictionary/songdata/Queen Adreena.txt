I make you a prayer a heavenly surrender  
To the one somewhere out there  
The one who can mend her  
I pray for the one who can open my door  
Let me go through it  
Oh yes give me more  
A prayer for the lover, the willing intender  
To break down the girl a heavenly surrender  
I crave your violence, act it upon me  
Set me free by your weighted autonomy  
I am so human so small so debased  
Jealously and darkness rule over this place  
A prayer for the lover the willing intender  
To break down the girl a heavenly surrender  
I'm a lover of freedom but I cling to the dust  
I'm blown by the wind I'm a slave I am lust  
Please rub my face in the shit that I sleep in  
Tie me and bind me up for your keeping  
I make you a prayer a heavenly surrender  
To the one somewhere out there  
The one who can mend her

A black soot stain  
Struck across the sky  
The shadow crept up the wall and stayed  
Eclipse in her daddies eye  
She prepared for an occupation  
She climed she cut away  
But with each cut the root grew deeper  
And she drown in his blood embrace  
So where are your angels?  
A dirty old claw caught at her breast  
Blood on the kitchen floor  
A tightrope yawning at her undress  
Her skyline all rip and torn  
She prepared for an occupation  
She climbed she cut away  
The crows to steal on her battlefield  
Sharpen her bloodied nail  
So where are your angels?  
Charlie's rack salt peter  
Pissing spit and claw  
The crows to steal on her batlefield  
She's down on the bedroom floor  
She collapse in a rain of whale spill  
She ride the briding spree  
She white feather blind  
On her washing line  
I cut cut cut cut her free

I swim the lake for I have lost my shoes,  
I'm holding on,  
I'm still awaiting you,  
You cling to me but I remain composed,  
I'll take the blame, grow you a thornless rose  
I swim the lake for I have lost my shoes,  
I'm holding on,  
I'm still awaiting you,  
Awaiting you,  
Awaiting you  
I swallow deep but the distance grows,  
I'm struggling on to find the endless road  
You cling to me, but I remain composed,  
The moon is full, but the darkness knows  
I swim the lake for I have lost my shoes,  
I'm holding on,  
I'm still awaiting you,  
Awaiting you,

Beneath the Skin a caustic red river  
Beneath the Skin corrosive abuser  
Beneath the Skin genetic in rupture  
Beneath the Skin all cold and hungered  
Beneath the Skin a still born forgiveness  
Beneath the Skin cell transfer in whispers  
Beneath the Skin a lover cries murder  
Beneath the Skin all cold and hungered  
Beneath the Skin I wasted this moment  
Beneath the Skin old undiscovered  
Beneath the Skin another lies ruptured  
Beneath the Skin all cold and hungered

Birdnest hair so slips the dream  
A paper boat in heavy seas  
Into thin air lost upon on the tidal stream  
Another year  
But I don't care  
Birdnest hair  
Her resolve  
Her retribution  
Hands are tied  
Dissolution  
It's just me here  
Fetal postition  
Make up your mind  
Make a decision  
Birdnest hair the frozen breath  
Of butterflies she dissapears  
Into thin air the falling star  
Slips from my hand I'm out of here  
But I don't care  
Birdnest hair  
Her resolve  
Her retribution  
Sticks and stones  
Dissolution  
Hands are tied  
Fetal position  
Is that the time  
I must be leaving

Childproof to the letter  
You know the truth you know better  
The girl on the pavement  
She's spinning  
Don't be long come and get her  
I need a drink so just forget her  
Time just slips through my fingers  
Hold onto life  
Hold on despite this  
I've seen your eyes shine  
Just get through the night this time  
Resolve is weak I abuse it  
You turn your cheek then I'll loose it  
Life just slips through my fingers  
I blame him and I hurt him  
Turn the screw rub the dirt in  
There's dirt under my fingers  
Hold onto life  
Hold on despite this  
I've seen your eyes shine  
Just get through the night this time  
Just get through the night this time  
I wanted it and I can't get  
It was heaven sent so I spent it  
The sky just slipped through my fingers  
One more round for the lady  
As I hit the ground whisper maybe  
I will get on my feet again  
Not open to your suggestions  
I'll change the locks won't answer questions  
I will get on my feet again  
Hold onto life  
Hold on despite this  
I've seen your eyes shine  
Just get through the night this time  
Just get through the night this time  
Just get through the night this time

I arch my back to touch the stars  
as they fall from my hand  
for tommorrow the sun will rise again  
a pearl a grain of sand  
I let the clothes slip from my bones  
I step into the stream  
for tommorrow the sun will rise again  
I'm washing my hands clean  
my darling child was lost at sea today  
and in the cold light she fades  
show me how to break the waves  
collision of the soul  
for tommorrow the sun will rise again  
she's taking me back home

For I am the way  
Burn all effigies of clay  
Walk on water today  
For I am the way  
For I am the way  
Today I turn my blood to sweetest wine  
A holy sign imbued with the divine  
Today's the day the gods walk out on me  
The great divide is crossed for you by me  
For I am the way  
Burn all effigies of clay  
Walk on water today  
For I am the way  
For I am the way  
Today the silent one does have her say  
Today all contradictions seemed ok  
Today's the day that I become the sky  
A silent understanding, my, oh my..  
For I am the way  
Burn all effigies of clay  
Walk on water today  
For I am the way  
For I am the way  
Today, for once, I'm not the last to learn  
Today the only bridge I have, I burn  
Today's the day the gods walk out on me  
The great divide is crossed for you by me  
For I am the way  
For I am the way  
For I am the way  
For I am the way.

Inside her tower she feels free from harm,  
I'll lock her up inside safe and warm,  
She'll sleep for winter she'll sleep for years,  
The garden's overgrown over her tears.  
Hide from time,  
Hide from time.  
Grow the garden year after year,  
The roots dug deep she won't be found down here,  
Brambles thorns will keep the boys away hey hey,  
She needs her sleep she won't play today.  
Hide from time,  
Hide from time.  
I'll keep her heart I'll keep it in one piece,  
I'll be with her through years and years of sleep,  
I'll make this moment last I'll beat time,  
I'll be with her forever make her mine.  
Hide from time,  
Hide from time.

(K. J. Garside C. Gray)  
They open my window... In comes the light,  
I froze in the corner... I pray for the night,  
But if it's you my dear who turns on the light,  
I'll eat from your hands as a bird with no fear no no,  
Fear.  
Because I adore you,  
I adore you,  
I adore you,  
I adore you.  
Rise up my dark star... Face into the night,  
Come out of your corner.. Shine for the night,  
If it's you my love who turns on the light,  
I'll eat from your hands as a bird with no fear no no,  
Fear.  
Because I adore you,  
I adore you,  
I adore you,  
I adore you,  
I adore you,  
I adore you.  
Climb out of the shadows... Crawl into the night,  
Fall out of the window... Die to the night,  
If it's you my love who turns on the light,  
I'll eat from your hands as a bird with no fear no no,  
Fear.  
Because I adore you...

i wreck your bed  
the colour is honey  
your finger prints marking my wall  
in red  
i take a light plex  
put it around your kneck  
i turn it on a choking blue  
fire in your eyes  
in red  
make me confess  
shut your mouth  
rip my dress  
don't ever protest that you don't  
want this mess  
don't even pretend that i  
could be your friend  
i climb the walls  
knuckles are bleeding  
throw me down  
push my face into the fire  
you liar  
your crossed the line  
you're tripping on guilty  
i undermine  
your girlfriend and you in the pyre  
you liar

i join the dots and i post date this letter  
so cross out my name you'd do best to forget her  
collapse of synapse she can't tie her laces  
learn to forgive her forget her disgraces  
i join the dots and i brought shame upon you  
so cross out my name as i come to seduce you  
i join the dots and i cry insurrection  
the river runs through it she knows my defection  
expose her devises you knew all along  
the girl in the mirror she'll sing you a song  
i join the dots and i brought shame upon you  
so cross out my name as i come to seduce you  
i become you  
i join the dots and this river below me  
for i am the rain and i'm running down country  
reach out on a limb and i touched severed vein  
her breath in the mirror i'll cross out my name

He talks about you in his sleep  
And there's nothing I can do to keep  
From crying when he calls your name, Jolene  
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene  
I'm begging of you, please don't take my man  
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene  
Please don't take him just because you can  
Your beauty is beyond compare

With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green  
Your smile is like a breath of spring  
Your voice is soft like summer rain  
And I cannot compete with you, Jolene  
He talks about you in his sleep  
And there's nothing I can do to keep  
From crying when he calls your name, Jolene

My happiness depends on you  
And whatever you decide to do, Jolene  
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene  
I'm begging of you, please don't take my man  
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene  
Please don't take him even though you can  
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene!

Cut her into little pieces  
Move her round the plate  
Knife and Fork, I'll dream you're all talk  
I'm kissing my disgrace  
Kissing my disgrace  
Older fragments with no meaning  
Cloaked her smiling face  
Today I eat myself a breakfast  
I'm kissing my Disgrace  
Cut her into little pieces  
Move her round the plate  
Knife and Fork, I'll dream you're all talk  
I'm kissing my disgrace  
Kissing my disgrace (repeated)

Let not your hold be so tight,  
She'll return in the morning,  
If you give her the night.  
Madraykin is she suffering?  
Is she suffering?  
Madraykin is she suffering?  
Revealing her birthmark you cast out her eye,  
Clipped are the wings of the angels sighs,  
Revealing her birthmark you put out her tongue,  
Clipped are the wings of the fairies who run.  
Madraykin is she suffering?  
Is she suffering?  
Madraykin is she suffering?  
How deep does she weep in your well of unkeep,  
The kiss of Madraykin will keep you from sleep.  
Keep you from sleep,  
Keep you from sleep,  
Keep you from sleep,  
Keep you from sleep.

My baby talks in his sleep  
I said wake him up  
She's out on good behaviour  
Even daddies love won't save her  
I said my prayers as I suck on the medicine jar  
I'm bound in his reflection  
We drink his mothers milk with conviction  
My baby cries on the cross as she bled him dry  
Drink ocean deep there's plenty  
Oh baby go to sleep it's empty  
I said my prayers in the medicine jar  
I dry my tears  
I hide my fears  
I drown in arrears  
In the medicine jar

My silent undoing  
My silent undoing  
My silent undoing  
My silent undoing  
My wasp in a jar  
Protruding hips  
And skull, and spine  
Ribcage cuts a clear outline  
Oh, oh  
All roped up and pinching in  
Distorted and disfiguring  
Oh, oh  
My silent undoing  
My silent undoing  
My wasp in a jar  
No photographs around the back  
Emaciated, iron flat  
Oh, oh  
Dehydrated cutting bones  
Today I'm over 7 stone  
Oh, oh  
My wasp in a jar  
My wasp in a jar  
My wasp in a jar  
Twinkle little star  
My wasp in a jar.

Careening crazy and awaked  
Night spark make her escape  
Spinning sick on the whack of a wheel  
  
Headlamp flashing close by  
Banging eyes  
Fireflies  
Drip in burst  
'Gainst the keening lean  
Of my night curse  
  
Have I drunk my brain away?  
Has he shouted my thinking out?  
Well here I am still thinking just entirely devoid of  
Anything  
That I would consider of worth  
Just a ghost on this earth  
'Gainst the keening lean  
Of my night curse  
  
No I don't know what to do  
Do you know what to do?  
I don't know what to do  
You do, do you?  
  
No I don't know what to do  
Do you know what to do?  
I don't know what to do  
You don't, do you?  
  
There is a fist around a brittle stem  
Shake a fine dust off my tongue  
I hear the shriek of a molecule  
As she gets sucked and lacerated through a filter of  
You  
  
Headlamp flashing close by  
Banging eyes  
Fireflies  
Drip in burst  
'Gainst the keening lean  
Of my night curse  
  
No I don't know what to do  
Do you know what to do?  
I don't know what to do  
You do, do you?  
  
No I don't know what to do  
Do you know what to do?  
I don't know what to do  
You don't, do you?  
  
Careening crazy and awaked  
Night spark make her escape  
Spinning sick on the whack of a wheel  
Headlamp flashing close by  
Banging eyes  
Fireflies  
Drip in burst  
'Gainst the keening lean  
Of my night curse  
  
No I don't know what to do  
Do you know what to do?  
I don't know what to do  
You do, do you?  
  
No I don't know what to do  
Do you know what to do?  
I don't know what to do  
You don't, do you?  
You don't, do you?  
You don't, do you?

Polly pretty Polly come go away with me,  
Polly pretty Polly come go away with me,  
Before we get married some pleasures to see.  
She jumped up beside him and away they did go,  
She jumped up beside him and away they did go,  
Over the mountains and the valleys below.  
Billy oh Billy I'm afraid for my life,  
Billy oh Billy I'm afraid for my life,  
I'm afraid you mean to murder me and leave me behind,  
Polly pretty Polly you're guessing about right,  
Polly pretty Polly you're guessing about right,  
I've been digging your grave for the best part of your,  
Life.  
He stabbed her through the heart and her hot blood did,  
Flow,  
He stabbed her through the heart and her hot blood did,  
Flow,  
And into the grave pretty Polly did go.  
He threw a little dirt over her and started for home,  
He threw a little dirt over her and started for home,  
Leaving nobody there but the wild birds to moan.  
A debt to the devil Billy must pay,  
A debt to the devil Billy must pay,  
For killing pretty Polly and running away.

Hang it up Sailor  
Your flag ship it burns  
And it burns and it burns  
You took the straight road  
You just missed the turn,  
You're out of gas out of gas

And I've got a crack whores dreams upon my tail  
Sweet love for sale love for sale

Do or die that is my question  
A little seed burning in me  
It's hot I must get water  
Racing towards the sun  
Do or die break or burn  
I've still got so much to learn  
My breath is tearing with the dying sun  
Racing towards the sun  
I can't breath  
I got sucked underneath  
She won't fight for breath now  
Have a little taste of death now  
Rise and fall rise and fall  
I've seen it all  
Racing towards the sun

I rip open  
Clouds with no faces  
She undoes herself  
For a slice of your pie  
Razorblade sky  
Razorblade sky  
I quench your thirst  
I bleed you dry  
Help you make your bed  
Come undone  
Razorblade sky

Identifying marks  
Our history picked out in stars  
We rip open the firmamment  
Razorblade sky  
Razorblade sky  
Sky, sky, sky

Sky, sky, sky

Oh so, my love  
This sleeping pill  
Will watch you through the night  
And come dawn  
I'll be long, long gone  
I tried, I tried, I tried  
I.. Tried, i.. Tried  
We feed upon the broken branch  
We kiss the stars goodbye  
For the sun can't fight this overcast  
I tried, I tried, I tried  
I.. Tried, i.. Tried  
The spider's web  
It can't break our fall  
I whisper to the sky  
I pray she takes you in her arms  
I tried, I tried, I tried  
I.. Tried, i.. Tried  
I.. Tried..  
Storm warning in the sand  
She evaporates beneath my fingernails  
The road is lost underwater  
She's running down a river with eels  
She is lost to me.

i learn how to dance with the dog  
i set the scales i'm fishing for murder  
this whore in jail  
i'll bang nail in her  
i learn how to dance with the dog  
it's a fox it's a bird it's a snake it's a word  
i heard it crawl from my veins  
your name  
it's your name  
it's your name  
i learn how to dance with the dog

(C. Gray)  
You walk all over anyone who dares to be a friend,  
Screen and yell because you deem them unenlightened,  
High upon your horse you preach and preach and preach,  
Love thy fellow humans all your filthy little creeps.  
X-ing off the days,  
X-ing off the days  
I nearly broke my back as I was handing back for you,  
Half the time was hell and half a waste of time,  
High upon your horse you preach and preach and preach,  
Love thy fellow humans all your filthy little creeps.  
X-ing off the days,  
X-ing off the days.  
I do not know the answer to the universe I fear,  
So drown me cold and go and find your perfect man my,  
Dear,  
High upon your horse you preach and preach and preach,  
Love thy fellow humans all your filthy little creeps,  
X-ing off the days,  
X-ing off the days.

(K. J. Garside C. Gray)  
Ten planes falling from the sky,  
The setting sun leaves no trace,  
My name was written in the sky,  
But now there is no trace.  
Yesterday's hymn serves me not,  
Tick tock tick tock tick tock.  
Shadow faces reaching for me,  
Pretending they know what's best for me,  
But I know that I am their experiment,  
I scare myself with paranoid talk.  
Yesterday's hymn serves me not,  
Tick tock tick tock tick tock.  
I try to keep the whispered words at bay,  
For they seem to feed into the mire,  
I've lost all ability to make any choices,  
I'm teetering in purgatory.  
Yesterday's hymn serves me not,  
Tick tock tick tock tick tock.
