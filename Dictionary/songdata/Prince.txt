The year is 2020  
And in the club - Love4OneAnother  
Students dance 2 the heartbeat of the drum  
  
3000 or more dance on the dance floor  
Same aesthetics - everyone  
Taste the color, smell the fun  
  
The force of nature is what brought us here  
The walls between us soon all disappear  
The year is 2020 and there's no more fear  
  
Can U see this? (Mm hmm)  
Peace and happy people  
(Mm hmm)

How can a non-musician discuss the future of music  
From anything other than a consumer point of view?  
These people make decisions for the bulk of us  
Without consulting any of us  
Sales and distributions of our futures  
If this world were fair and right  
They'd give up the car keys this very night  
Damn, hit it  
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7  
Flash forward, 2045  
What did you stand for in the life of your prime  
When faced with the final judgment of today  
Who profited from the game  
That you and your niggas play  
Radical man, save a life  
Come on, take a stand, give that money back  
Let's make a plan, the brand new currency  
Taking care of one another you and me  
Radical, radical  
Flash backward, 1999  
In a world shockful of viruses  
How'd y'all stay alive?  
Depending on this so-called man  
For everything you got comes from his hand  
Food, water, the clothes you wear  
How many of y'all niggas really care?  
We don't care  
Let's define this word, nigga  
Someone who stays high  
Watching their life go by  
Someone content with riding it behind, nigga  
They come in all colors, white, black, Puerto Rican  
But the main niggas we speakin' 'bout  
Wear suits and buy and sell corporations  
With only one thing in mind  
Break it up  
That is the destruction of the  
So-called radical man by 2045  
Let's get radical  
Let's get radical  
Watch me now  
Schooled in the art of digital games  
When the war broke out they called your name  
Everyone of color put on the front line  
Holocaust Avenue, 2009  
Get an education, good job, who says?  
Fool with the gold fronts drinkin' Alize  
They don't play by the rules makin' no sense today  
Gotcha on line so you think it's okay  
Better built cell block, mos def say  
That's where you gonna stay, nigga  
Where you gonna stay, nigga?  
Oh my God, it's the Green Mile  
Radical, radical man  
Radical, radical man  
Radical, radical man  
Radical man  
What's up, y'all? What y'all wanna do?  
Ain't nobody up in that crew know  
How to really run that computer  
And make it flow  
If you ain't born with it  
You know, talkin' about the to and fro, hit me  
Come on, you know way down  
What George say, fall around, alright  
We claim Miles Davis, not Michaelangelo  
We playin' D-flat in the funk  
You better act like you know  
We don't care what Albert Einstein did  
I'd rather know, rather know  
How they built the pyramid, hey  
James Brown, Chuck D. and Jimi  
Turn me up louder now  
And I don't think y'all hear me  
2045, we will stay alive  
2045, God is on our side  
The whole pop scenario is just nothin'  
But a dream  
The day you wake up is the day  
You get the real cream, nigga  
Radical man  
Who got the plan, who got the plan?  
Radical man  
Who got the plan, who got the plan?  
This is the funk the industry most fears  
All of us getting together  
In a locked board of directors  
I don't think so  
Ain't nobody runnin' this  
It's all about DNA, the radical man  
Where will you be in 2045?  
30 million people right now  
Are being wiped off the face of the planet  
By a disease they claim has no cure  
In the matter of a blinking eye  
All of us right now can testify  
Take a stand, radical man, oh  

Serve it up, Frankie

Precisely what I let Robert

DJ turn it up  
Let's go  
Three one two one  
It's loco right?  
  
Through the gates, knock on the door  
Put you're clothes in the pile on the floor  
Take you're pick from the Japanese robes and sandals  
Drink champagne from a glass with chocolate handles  
  
[Chorus:]  
Don't you wanna come? Three one two one  
Gonna be so much fun three one two one  
That's where the party be three one two one  
You can come if you want to,  
But you can never leave  
  
Look over there  
There's another turn-on  
Butterflies scared that they're going to be awake all night long  
Dancin' in you're belly  
Like a ballerina  
In spit of you're efforts to calm them down  
  
[Chorus]  
  
House party ya'll  
It's going down people  
Like the wall of Berlin  
  
Lock the door  
'Til you see the sun  
We gon' party like there ain't gonna be another one  
Futuristic fantasy  
This is where the purple party people be  
This is where the party be three one two one  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's goin' down, people  
Like the wall of Berlin

If I don't think about the fact that she left me  
If I don't see the pearls fall from the sky  
If I don't hear the accusations of blasphemy  
If I don't feel the tears in my eyes  
This is the best day of my life  
You say u'll call me and then and then you don't  
I'll want 2 kiss you and then I won't  
We both do nothing and call it love  
Is this love?  
Is this love?  
  
This morning I wanted a cup of coffee  
But I didn't have any cream  
Last night I wanted some inspiration  
But I didn't have any dreams  
Coupled with the fact that you belong 2 another  
Whose name is self-righteousness  
So evil girl, if one of us has a date  
With the undertaker, which one will it be?  
You can cry 4 ever, but u'll get no sympathy  
This is the best day of my life  
  
I've got 3 chains o' gold  
And they will shine 4 ever  
They are the nucleus of my soul  
Melt down, no, they will never  
  
I've got 3 chains o' gold  
And they will shine 4 ever  
They are the nucleus of my soul  
Melt down, no, they will never  
  
Give back the chains - if you don't you will die  
Nothing should come between you and I  
  
I've got 3 chains o' gold  
And they will shine 4 ever  
If one of us has 2 go  
You will go before me  
  
If one of us has 2 go (3 chains o' gold)  
You will go before me  
(3 chains o' gold)  
You will go before me, baby (they will shine 4 ever)  
Cuz I sho 'nuff say you will  
  
(3 chains o' gold)  
(you will go before me)  
(you will go before me)  
(you will go before me)  
(you will go before me)  
  
I've got 3 chains o' gold  
They gonna shine...  
  
Forever, forever, forever  
  
(3 chains o' gold)

Using a special code he accessed his mind  
In search of the reason why  
In passion and fashion he began travelin' time  
3rd eye, 3rd eye, 3rd eye  
  
The serpent approves  
Then appears between Adam's thighs  
And he tries 2 release upon Eve the nectar  
The injector tries  
He tries, he tries, he tries  
  
So abduction complete  
All stand on their feet  
Look at one another and cry  
  
What have we done?  
Could this be the fun  
On the dotted line 4 which I did sign?  
Oh yeah  
  
I resign from the notion  
Cuz yours was the potion  
That I'm supposed 2 die 4  
I resign  
  
In self-pity so dark  
This shitty and stark  
Realization is all that will soothe  
  
Ultimately the only one  
That can save you is you  
Your God is inside and 4 that God you will do  
Whatever it takes  
If nothing else is true  
The only one that can save you is you, yeah  
  
(Shoobedoop)

Long ago, there was a man  
Change stone to bread with the touch of his hand  
Made the blind see and the dumb understand  
  
He died for the tears in your eyes  
Your eyes  
  
Many people came from all around  
Hear this man preach, glorious sound  
Spoke of man in harmony and love abound  
  
He died for the tears in your eyes  
Your eyes  
  
Your eyes  
Your, eyes  
  
Died for the tears in your eyes  
For the tears in your eyes  
And the tears of sorrow  
For cents may be all that they're worth  
For the rising sun each day assures us  
The meek shall inherit the earth  
The earth  
  
Faith is a word, we all should try  
Describing the man who willingly died  
Believe that your hunger, sorrow, and fears  
  
Is less than the tears in your eyes  
Your eyes  
  
Less than the tears in your eyes  
For the tears in your eyes  
And the tears of sorrow  
For cents may be all that they're worth (All they're worth)  
For the rising sun each day assures us  
The meek shall inherit the earth  
  
Say it again  
For the tears in your eyes  
And the tears of sorrow  
For cents may be all that they're worth (All they're worth)  
For the rising sun each day assures us  
The meek shall inherit the earth  
The earth  
  
Thank you

It took five women to getcha off of my mind  
It took five months, a plenty good wasted time  
But it just took five minutes when I saw your face again  
To fall in love all over, I guess with you I'll never win  
  
March was a cold one in more ways than one  
Went down to the nightclub lookin' for the sun  
Lookin' for a light that could brighten up a day  
That's been darker than a hole since you went away  
  
April usually brings showers  
This time it was a hurtin' kind  
This woman said she wanted my baby  
I told her I'd have to be deaf, dumb, and blind  
To fall in love with someone that I barely knew  
The baby would never really have a father  
Cause I still, 'cause I still, 'cause I still, still, still, huh  
Be stuck on you  
  
It took five women to getcha off of my mind  
Get off my mind, baby  
Fallin' in love all over...you I'll never win  
  
May was her name, she was jumpin'  
Jumpin' from plane to plane  
Actress or model or somethin'  
Can't even remember her first name  
  
June brought an Easter bunny  
Needless to say, hmph, that girl was late  
Told a made-up story to a busy-body of our only date  
What a sketch!  
  
July was a heartbreak, extraordinary  
Said I met this woman whose kiss was somethin' scary  
It felt so much, so much like yours  
But it only made me, made me want you more  
She's gone, she's gone but you're still here  
I want you very...huh, it's you I fear  
  
But it took five women to get you off my mind  
It took five months, five months, a plenty good wasted time  
But it just took five minutes and I saw your face again  
I fell in love all over with you, I guess I'll never win  
(I'll never win)

All 7 and we'll watch them fall  
They stand in the way of love  
And we will smoke them all  
With an intellect and a savior-faire  
No one in the whole universe  
Will ever compare  
  
I am yours now and you are mine  
And together we'll love through  
All space and time, so don't cry  
One day all 7 will die  
  
All 7 and we'll watch them fall  
They stand in the way of love  
And we will smoke them all  
With an intellect and a savoir-faire  
No one in the whole universe  
Will ever compare  
  
I am yours now and you are mine  
And together we'll love through  
All space and time, so don't cry  
One day all 7 will die  
  
And I saw an angel come down unto me  
In her hand she holds the very key  
Words of compassion, words of peace  
And in the distance an army's marching feet (1 2 3 4, 1 2 3 4)  
But behold, we will watch them fall  
  
And we lay down on the sand of the sea  
And before us animosity will stand and decree  
That we speak not of love only blasphemy  
And in the distance, 6 others will curse me  
But that's alright (That's alright)  
4 I will watch them fall (1 2 3 4 5 6 7)  
  
All 7 and we'll watch them fall  
They stand in the way of love  
And we will smoke them all  
With an intellect and a savoir-faire  
No one in the whole universe  
Will ever compare  
  
I am yours now and you are mine  
And together we'll love through  
All space and time, so don't cry  
One day all 7 will die  
  
(Just how old)  
  
And we will see a plague and a river of blood  
And every evil soul will surely die in spite of  
Their 7 tears, but do not fear  
4 in the distance, 12 souls from now  
You and me will still be here - we will still be here  
  
There will be a new city with streets of gold  
The young so educated they never grow old  
And a, there will be no death 4 with every breath  
The voice of many colors sings a song  
That's so bold  
Sing it while we watch them fall  
  
All 7 and we'll watch them fall  
They stand in the way of love  
And we will smoke them all  
With an intellect and a savoir-faire  
No one in the whole universe  
Will ever compare  
  
I am yours now and you are mine  
And together we'll love through  
All space and time, so don't cry  
One day all 7 will die  
  
(Just how old) [Repeat: x3]

Ohh, ah, yeah

Hot desert sun, U can feel the heat  
Every drop of sweat on your brow is what I am so U best believe  
  
[Chorus:]  
I got 1,000 hugs and kisses 4 U when U come back home, baby (Ooh woo)  
I got 1,000 hugs and kisses 4 U when U come back home, baby (Ooh woo)  
  
When U give 'em your all, and still it's only second best  
U can come and lay your head upon your baby's chest  
Every one of your worries, all your miseries (All your miseries)  
U can put them in the little book and ship them off 2 sea  
Cuz...  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ohh, ah, yeah

Seems like all we ever find is another reason 2 cry  
As long as U got me I got your back and this is why  
  
U work so hard, U really do  
I don't think that anyone could ever work as hard as U  
Better lock the door, U better unplug the phone  
Cuz I'm gonna give 1,000 reasons why we need 2 be alone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I got 1,000 hugs and kisses, baby, when U get back home  
When U get back home

Because I turned my eye toward you  
Because I seek your hand  
Every other woman envies you  
And me, every other man  
  
A massive circle of jealousy  
Is coming round again  
Those prickly fingered scallywags  
That masquerade as friends  
  
Make a promise this very night  
That they will no longer pose  
A threat to either one of us  
Then let the chapter close  
  
For all the midnights, in the world  
This one will serve us better  
If you choose to be my girl  
  
Like Susan's petals  
A wonderful life, the two of us shall lead  
The children of the future've all the  
Spiritual food they need  
  
The secrets that the ones before  
With grace, they've come and shown  
Together with love for one another  
We shall make them known  
  
With the love and happy days  
I number the grains of sand  
Writing twelve times ever more  
If I could be your man  
  
Amethyst and rubies  
Crystals and black pearls  
I trade them all, just to spend with you  
All the midnights, in the world  
  
All the midnights, in the world

In a deep sleep I fell  
And the music starts 2 swell  
One of my ribs He took and it shall be  
Bone of my bones (bone of my bones)  
And God created woman  
And we were naked and did not care  
There's a time 2 take and a time 2 share  
2 in love, all around and all aware  
Flesh of my flesh (flesh of my flesh)  
And God created woman  
  
Temptation sweet and so much (sweet and so much)  
Surely die if neither one of us shall ye touch (shall ye touch)  
Then again we could die from the rush (rush)  
Heart of my heart (heart of my heart)  
And God created woman (woman)  
  
Woman  
My-my-my-my-my-my woman

Many serpents who have lied (lied)  
Given half the chance still I'd run 2 your side (run 2 your side)  
Love of my love (love of my love)  
And God created woman (woman)  
  
And if I never see you again  
It's alright 4 I am guilty of no sin  
They can have you, I'll have your love in the end  
Soul of my soul (soul of my soul)

Last night I spent another lonely Christmas  
Darling, darling, you should've been there  
Cause all the ones I dream about  
You are the one that makes my love shout  
You see, you are the only one I care for  
  
Remember the time we swam naked  
In your father's pool?  
Boy he was upset that night  
But boy was that ever cool  
  
Remember the night we played poker for money  
And you robbed me blind  
Remember how you used to scream so loud  
Cause you hated that number nine  
  
Hey, I saw your sister skating on the lake  
This afternoon  
Good Heaven how she's grown  
She swoons the boy skaters she's so tall  
  
But of all your father's children  
All your father's children, baby  
You know, you are the finest of them all  
You are brighter than the northern star  
  
Last night I spent another lonely Christmas  
Darling, darling, you, you should've been there  
You see, of all the ones I dream about  
You are the one that makes my love shout  
You see, you are the only one I care for  
Yeah  
  
My momma used to say  
Always trust your lover  
Now I guess that only applies to her  
  
Cause baby you promised me  
Baby you promised me you'd never leave  
Then you died on the twenty fifth day of December  
Oh baby  
  
Last night I spent another lonely, lonely Christmas  
Darling, baby, you, you should've been there  
Cause all the ones I dream about  
You are the one that makes my love shout  
You see, you are the only one I care for  
Yeah  
  
Your father said it was pneumonia  
Your mother said it was strep  
But the doctor said you were dead  
And I, I say its senseless  
  
Every Christmas night for seven years now  
I drink banana daquaris 'til I'm blind  
As long as I can hear you smilin' baby  
You won't hear my tears  
Another lonely Christmas is mine  
Yeah, mine  
Yeah  
Another lonely Christmas is mine  
  
Last night, yeah, I spent another lonely, lonely Christmas  
Darling, darling, you should've been there, yeah  
Cause all the ones I dream about  
You are the one that makes my love shout  
You see, you are the only one I care for  
  
Another lonely...

You ask me if I love you, it's automatic  
Cause every time you leave me, I die, that's automatic to  
You ask me to forgive you, when you know, I'm just an addict

Stop the music baby, you know, I'm an automatic fool  
Hey

A-U-T-O-matic, so in love with you  
  
Don't say no man has ever tasted your ice cream  
Baby you're the purple star in the night supreme  
You'll always be a virgin for no man deserves your love  
I only pray that when you dream, I'm the one you dream of  
I pray that when you dream, you dream of how we kissed  
Not with our lips but with our souls  
Stop me if I bore you  
Why is it that I think we'd be so good in bed?  
Can you hear me? Why do I love you so much?  
It's strange, I'm more comfortable around you when I'm naked,  
Can you hear me?  
I wonder if you have any mercy, don't torture me  
  
Stop the music baby, automatic fool  
  
When it comes to you I'm automatic baby  
There's no one else like me  
I'm the best you'll ever find  
No one else could understand you, you're to complex  
They say nothing's perfect, but they don't know you  
That's automatic to  
Can you hear me? (A-U-T-O-matic)  
Yes, I'm addicted to your pleasure  
I'm addicted to your pain  
It's automatic (A-U-T-O-matic)

Fasten your seat belts  
Prepare for takeoff

(Not with your lips but with your soul)  
(With you I'm never bored, talk to me some more)  
(I can hear you, I'm going to have to torture you now)

He was not or never had been in favor  
Of setting are people free  
If it wasn't for the thirteenth Amendment  
We woulda been born in slavery  
He was not or never had been in favor  
Of letting us vote so you see...  
Abraham Lincoln was a racist who said  
"You cannot escape from history"  
  
Like the snow comin' down the mountain  
That landed on Wounded Knee  
Nobody wants to take the weight  
The responsibility  
  
Hear the joyous sound of freedom  
The Harlem Renaissance  
Hear Duke Ellington and his band  
Kick another jungle jam  
Ooh, do you wanna dance?  
Who's that lurking in the shadows?  
Mr. John Hammond with his pen in hand...  
Sayin' "Sign you're kingdom over to me  
And be known throughout the land!"  
But, you ain't got no money, you ain't got no cash  
So you sign yo name and he claims innocence  
Just like every snowflake in an avalanche...  
  
Like the snow comin' down the mountain  
That landed on Wounded Knee  
Nobody wants to take the weight  
The responsibility

Baby, what are we gonna do?  
I'm so in love with you  
Baby, what are we gonna do?  
I know you're in love with me to  
Should we go on living together?  
Or should we get married right away?  
Whatever you decide,  
I'll still love you, baby  
And we'll grow stronger everyday  
Baby, what are we gonna do?  
I barely have enough money for two  
Baby, what are we gonna do?  
I don't want to regret what I've done to you  
I never would've thought that this would happen  
To a very careful man like me  
But baby, pretty baby, we're gonna work it out, yeah  
I love you, I love you, can't you see?  
  
Baby, baby, baby  
It's you, 'said it's you that I truly adore  
Oh, baby, baby (baby, baby)  
Oh, baby, babe,  
I hope our baby has eyes just like yours (just like yours)

One, two, three, four  
Hey, look me over  
Tell me do you like what you see?  
Hey, I ain't got no money  
But honey I'm rich on personality  
Hey, check it all out  
Baby I know what it's all about  
Before the night is through  
You will see my point of view  
Even if I have too scream and shout  
  
[Chorus]  
Baby I'm a (star)  
Might not know it now  
Baby but I are, I'm a (star)  
I don't want to stop, 'til I reach the top  
Sing it (We are all a star!)  
  
Hey, take a listen  
Tell me do you like what you hear?  
If it don't turn you on  
Just say the word and I'm gone  
But honey I know, ain't nothing  
Wrong with your ears  
Hey, check it all out  
Better look now or it just might be too late (just might be too late)  
My lucks gonna change tonight  
There's gotta be a better life  
Take a picture sweetie  
I ain't got time 2 waste  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Everybody say, nothing come 2 easy  
But when you got it baby, nothing come 2 hard  
You'll see what I'm all about (see what I'm all about)  
If I gotta scream and shout (if I gotta scream and shout)  
Baby baby (baby) baby (baby) baby (baby)  
Yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah (star)  
  
Might not know it now  
Baby but I are, I'm a (star)  
I don't want to stop, 'til I reach the top  
Sing it! (star)  
  
Baby baby baby  
Oh baby I'm a (star)

Like what the fuck do they know.  
All their taste is in their mouth.  
Really. What the fuck do they know?  
Come on baby. Let's go, crazy

I knew from the start  
That I loved you with all my heart  
But you were untrue.  
You had another lover and she looked just like you  
Bambi, can't you understand?  
Bambi, it's better with a man  
  
It's so hard to believe  
Maybe it's because you're so young  
Or maybe I'm just too naive  
Who's to say, maybe you're really having fun  
  
Bambi, can't you understand?  
Bambi, it's better with a man  
  
All your lovers, they look just like you  
But they can only do the things that you do  
Come on, baby, and take me by the hand  
I'm gonna show what it's like to be loved by a man  
  
Bambi, I know what you need  
Bambi, maybe you need to bleed  
  
Yeah!

The most beautiful girl in the world  
Oh right  

Wake up  
You're beautiful, loved and blessed  
Feel me? (I think I do)  
  
When you found me I was just a piece of clay  
I was formless, you gave me a new name  
With the breath of life I now live abundantly  
All I needed was the potter's hand  
And the blood on Calvary (that's right)  
  
But to much power (tell it)  
Can can sometimes turn to shame  
To much desire  
Sometimes makes you feel the same (come on)  
But forgiveness is how you win the game  
I begged for truth, now I know the truth  
And that is when you came and said I was  
  
Beautiful, loved and blessed  
I'm better than the day before  
Cause you made me confess that I am,  
Beautiful, loved and blessed  
When you're free you're really free indeed  
All you gotta do is just plant the seed  
  
A constant battle to stay ahead of the game  
Is anybody famous when everybody wants fame?  
Always trying to break you down  
Thinkin' that'll raise 'em up  
I just wanna be happy  
Come take this bitter cup from me  
  
If I were ever to write my life story  
I could truly say through all the pain and glory  
I was just a piece of clay in need of the potter's hand  
Cause when you whispered in my ear  
The words I so now understand, oh  
  
Beautiful, loved and blessed  
I'm better than the day before  
Cause you made me confess that I am,  
Beautiful, loved and blessed  
When you're free you're really free indeed  
All you gotta do is just plant the seed  
  
Everything you made you said, "That's good"  
Before the fall of man you said, "That's good"  
Every time I walk in faith, that's good  
You let me see another day, that's good  
Before the earth was made you said,  
"Tamar, I will lead the way and you'll go far"  
Knowledge and understanding  
Understanding is good  
And when I wake up in the morning  
All I hear in my hood is people saying that they're  
  
Beautiful, loved and blessed  
When you rescue me from the darkness  
And our heart just must confess  
Beautiful, loved and blessed  
When you're free you're free indeed  
All you gotta do is just plant the seed  
  
Hey, hey, hey  
Wake up it's a new day  
Hey, hey, hey  
Wave you're hands in the air and say  
Hey, hey, hey  
Wake up it's a new day  
Hey, hey, hey  
Wave you're hands in the air and say  
  
Beautiful, loved and blessed  
You rescued me from the darkness in the wilderness  
But I am beautiful, loved and blessed  
No matter what the challenge  
I always pass the test  
  
That's what I am, beautiful  
That's what I am, beautiful  
I don't mean to put nobody down  
Still I must confess that I am  
Beautiful, that's what I am  
That's what I am  
When you wanna give up, don't cause you know  
You always got a friend  
  
That's what I am, that's what I am  
That's' what I am  
Beautiful, beautiful  
That's what I am, that's what I am  
That's' what I am  
Beautiful, beautiful  
Oh yeah, oh yeah  
Beautiful, beautiful  
Beautiful, beautiful

Strangely beautiful  
Beautiful strange  
That's what we said  
Instead of the name  
If you count the times  
He took all the blame  
You would find the reason  
Behind the game  
  
In the darkness  
We must look 4 the way  
Words so strange  
That only the mind can say  
If it makes no mind  
What color or holy day  
Why is this game  
The only one that we play  
  
Dive inside your sould if you wanna know  
The light inside the darkness 4ever glows  
The son is like the diamond inside the coal  
And like an embryo it grows and grows

Till U come back 2 me  
There'll be nothing left 2 say, no  
  
Broken  
My heart is broken, yeah  
Broken, oh baby  
My heart's just broken in 2  
Until U bring your sweet love, bring it on home 2 me  
I'll be your broken-hearted man alone in misery  
  
Broken, Lord  
My heart is broken, Lord  
Broken, yeah  
My heart's just broken in 2  
If U think that I'll beg 4 your sweet love, bring it on home 2 me

Lonely

Until U bring your sweet pussy, bring it on home 2 me  
I'll be your broken-hearted man alone in misery  
  
Cryin'

I'm just a-cryin', baby, all night  
I don't know what 2 do  
Until U bring your sweet honey, bring it on home 2 me

Oh oh, baby  
Until U, baby

Cymbals!  
  
Until U bring your sweet love, bring it on home 2 me  
I'll be your broken-hearted man alone, baby  
Broken-hearted man alone, baby  
Broken-hearted man alone in misery

MC T on a hit and to make sure I don't miss,  
Kick the beat as this fool persists  
  
Step off me, get the hell off, well I'm riding  
Flowing with this funky beat, you suckers keep on tryin'a  
Diss this, uh-uh, I ain't having it  
Sucker duck, understand my schedule work too heavy  
I'm a man, I mean, sometimes it seems hammer claim  
But I can still cop a lean and explain to you  
An MC who's got beef, I'm giving grief to disbelief  
You said that I was new to this well put me on your hit list  
I'm 'quipped to rule, and I squash all the bull  
  
[Chorus: ]  
We got our own ideas!  
We got our own ideas!  
Yeah  
  
Antagonistic action, it's just a fraction  
Oof what I feel for you, I'll take my time in a rhyme  
Yo, let's bust a move, I'm steppin' with confidence  
Yes I know it's evident, a backseat to you that's irrelevant  
You see it's like this, you shot and missed, and now it's my turn  
You learn, you mess with the fire, you burn. and it's a heat up  
Situation sticky  
You're the duck, huh, I won't be picky, I'm bassin'  
You're chasing a dream that I'm livin'  
You stupid pigeon, cause even with the high flow, I keep a low pro  
You step off on me, and that's a sho' nuff n.o.  
I mean a no-go  
Yeah, something like that  
  
[Chorus: ]  
  
Fuck it, you're tryin' to step on my tip, yeah  
  
I'm a brother with a purpose (pump it up, T)  
So I'll take my time and serve this right  
Despite the negativity,  
Never want society to get the best of me  
You sold out, just another fool, holdin' out  
On the pockets of my brothers tryin' to get clout  
Step back, cast the vapors, your vision's blurred, check out my behaviour  
Calm, cool, never sweat the issue (so what you're saying?)  
What I'm saying is that we're past due  
Gotta stand up and be counted, can't you see the trouble keeps mountin', boy  
And I won't stand for it, so get off  
'Cause I'm about to have a fit  
You can't step unless you step legit  
Enough talk y'all, this is it, let's get ill with this  
Yeah, yeah  
  
Suckers are trying to step off on my tip  
We got our own ideas!  
Suckers are trying to step off on my tip  
We got our own ideas!  
Suckers are trying to step off on my tip  
We got our own ideas!  
Suckers are trying to step off on my tip  
  
As I roast, you toast - can't stand the heat of the aftermath  
The worst you ran with you dis just to get a laugh  
the brother you ridiculed,  
they say you're the king of rules  
yeah, time for school, time for walking,  
I'm stalking, you're talking  
as you run your mouth down, I'm chalking up another way of  
gettin' paid in dividends  
in the end, my friend, its just a verbal blend  
yeah, get with that  
  
[Chorus: ]  
  
Brothers be jocking, freaks keep clocking  
Brothers be jocking, skeezers are clocking  
  
We got our own ideas!  
Skeezers be on my tip (yeah)  
trying to get with this  
We got our own ideas!  
Skeezers be on my tip (yeah)  
trying to get with this  
Skeezers be on my tip (yeah)  
trying to get with this  
Skeezers be on my tip (yeah)  
We got our own ideas!  
  
Trying to get to this  
Clocking, I got my own ideas,  
And they ain't got nothing to do with what's in here  
See ya next year, 91, in full effect  
I'm getting ign'ant  
(yeah, yeah)  
  
We got our own ideas! (yeah, yeah)

I don't like this much to drink  
I was there  
I know right now it's hard to think  
I don't care  
But it's time for you and me to wonder  
Why we're here  
Maybe we should roll to the rock and rumble  
Calhoun Square (Let's roll)  
  
[Chorus: ]  
Meet me there  
If you dare  
Calhoun Square!  
  
It don't matter clothes you're wearin'  
Or your hair  
If you're freaky, they don't care and  
They don't stare (Ain't nobody lookin' at you)  
All that matters if you're happy  
And if you're there (Are you there?)  
Don't you want to roll to the rock and rumble  
Calhoun Square? (Don't you want to? Come on now)  
  
Hey!  
  
[Chorus: ]  
  
Walk through veils of many colors  
If you dare (Do you dare?)  
Jasmine, peach and love for others  
In the air (It's all in the air)  
Don't be shocked to see your mother  
In the chair (Sit down, baby)  
Everybody roll to the rock and rumble  
Calhoun Square (Oh Lord)  
  
Hey, come on!  
Oh Lord...oh Lord  
Here me now  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
Calhoun Square, Calhoun Square  
  
Meet me there  
If you dare  
Calhoun Square!

Call, call my name  
Call it, call my name  
  
I heard your voice this morning calling out my name  
It had been so long since I heard it that it didn't sound quite the same, no  
But it let me know that my name had never really been spoken before  
Before the day I carried you through the bridal path door  
  
And ever since that day I haven't wanted anyone but you  
And anybody who really knows me knows the truth  
  
[Chorus]  
I just can't stop writing songs about you  
I love you so much  
I just can't wait to get my arms around you  
And feel your touch  
If I don't see you real soon baby girl  
I might go insane  
I know it's only been about 3 hours  
But I love it when you call my name  
  
I heard a voice on the news saying people want to stop the war  
If they had a love as sweet as you they'd forget what they were fighting for  
What's the matter with the world today?  
The land of the free? Somebody lied  
They can bug my phone and people 'round my home  
They'll only see you and me making love inside  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I've never seen the moon look so lovely as the night I saw it with you  
It let me know I'd never seen the moon before  
So many speak of the moon as though it had no flaws  
But to compare it to a beauty like yours would give one pause  
Nothing about you is false, that's why your love is real  
God forbid if you belonged to another I'd have to steal you  
I'd have to take you from your man  
I might be tempted to break the law round here  
Because your beauty, it gives one pause  
It slows me down  
  
[Chorus]

Dear Dad,  
Things didn't turn out quite like I wanted them to  
Sometimes I feel like I'm gonna explode  
  
Everybody want to see you down for the count  
But that ain't what being a real man's about  
The brave and the bold hang around for the kill  
So the bigger the hole, the bigger we fill it (fill it!)  
They can hit us with all they got  
But cha know what?  
What?  
  
I can't stop this feeling I got  
I feel it right down to my toes  
I can't stop this feeling I got  
My body got to have it you know  
I can't stop this feeling I got  
I'll write a letter to the whole world  
I can't stop this feeling I got  
Every man, woman, boy and girl  
  
Can't stop this feeling I got, I can't stop this feeling I got  
I can't stop this feeling I got, I can't stop this feeling I got  
  
I can't stop this feeling I got  
You know I can't sleep at night  
I can't stop, you know I love it a lot,  
I'm talking about an everlasting light.  
I can't stop this feeling I got  
I get to shaking all in my shoes  
I can't stop this feeling I got  
The doctor say there's nothing that he can do  
  
Can't stop this feeling I got, can't stop this feeling I got  
I can't stop this feeling I got, can't stop this feeling I got  
Keep on singing now  
  
Can't stop try to tell me how to paint my palace,  
That ain't where it's at,  
That's like trying to tell Columbus that the world is flat.  
If the song we're singing truly is the best  
Then that my brothers is the ultimate test  
All in favor say hey  
We can change anything at all.  
  
I, I, I can't stop. can't stop.  
I'm in a butt kicking mood tonight y'all  
Can't stop. can't stop.  
Can't stop this feeling I got [Repeat: x7]  
(no, no, no, no)  
Feeling, feeling, feeling, hey!  
Hey, pardon me for living, (pardon me for living)  
But this is my world, (this is my world)  
You can't make me change (you can't make me change)  
Maybe we all got to rearrange (rearrange)  
Our brains (our brains)  
  
Yeah, only we can change the world  
Only we can change the world  
Only we can change the world  
  
One, two, one, two, three  
I can't stop this feeling I got [Repeat: x3]  
Feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling, yeah!  
Yeah!

Cherry, Cherry  
Rozanda was her real name  
But Cherry was her chosen one  
Everybody said that she'd soon be dead  
But Cherry replied "At least I had some fun" (Oh yes)  
  
Her eyes were like a pool of 24 karat diamonds  
I was the last in a long line of foolish men who dived in  
  
Chorus:  
Cherry, Cherry  
I think about you every rising sun  
Whoa Cherry, Cherry  
Wherever you are, I hope U're havin' fun (Oh yes)  
  
Tuesday was my big game  
North vs. Central in basketball  
Underneath their long coats  
Cherry and the girls wore camisoles  
Every time North would run the hoop  
Cherry would flash 'em and they would fall  
But not as hard as I fell  
When Cherry gave me her number and told me 2 call (you should call me)  
  
Using all the money her boyfriend Wilbur gave her, she'd buy  
Anything I wanted, that's why my baby's so fly  
  
Chorus  
  
(Do do do do do)  
Me and Cherry got married  
And tried our best 2 keep it on the down low, the down low  
  
I was combing her hair  
The day that Wilbur called and cussed her on the phone  
He beat her up real bad and figured I was gonna leave her  
Instead I bought a 45 and set out 2 relieve her (Take him out)  
If he was taken out then he could never harm another  
No sooner than I got there, I was met by Cherry's mother cryin'  
  
Cherry, Cherry  
Every night I ask the Lord why? Oh why?  
Cherry, Cherry  
Another victim of a suicide (Why oh why?)  
Why?  
  
Cherry, Cherry  
I think about you every rising sun  
Whoa Cherry, Cherry  
Wherever you are, I hope U're havin' fun  
I hope U're having fun, baby  
  
Cherry, Cherry  
I'd give anything 2 kiss you  
Cherry, Cherry  
I guess I just miss you  
Cherry

I'm gonna see you in (Look at me)  
Your birthday suit tonight (She doesn't look as good as I do)

A whiz at math and all that shit (how 'bout that?)  
But I'm, I'm a tad more interested (Ah ha ha look it,)

But, baby I'm dying to take you everywhere (Oh yeah?)  
I want to show you to my friends  
Because baby, you're the living end (Tell me now)  
Let me have a debt worth winning,  
I can feel your ice is thinning  
Like a frozen pond in spring  
Your furry melting thing awaits me  
Your furry melting thing awaits me, (Oh Cindy C)  
And my six-string (Will you play with me?)

What's the matter with me, Cindy? (Nothing)  
  
(shockadelica)  
  
Oh Cindy see, won't you play with me?  
  
Music is the key to set yourself free  
From depression, drugs and increasing poverty  
The key is to the lock, the lock is on the door  
The door has a knob that you've never turned before  
The jack, use the jack, it opens up the lock  
Cause there's the key to unlock the body  
Place it like that to open up the door  
The door to the house full of people galore  
The beat won't stop 'til the JM jocks  
And he jacks the box 'til the party rocks  
The clock tick-tocks and the place gets hot  
And believe it or not, all the troubles you forgot  
It's just that easy if you want it to be  
For all the fellas, and the young ladies  
So ease your mind and set yourself free  
To the mystifying music that we call Cindy see  
  
Oh Cindy see, won't you play with me?  
Oh Cindy see

As war drums beat in Babylon  
Cinnamon girl starts to pray  
I've never heard a prayer like this 1  
Never before that day  
  
Tearful words of love for people she had never met before  
Asking God to grant them mercy in this face of a holy war  
  
Cinnamon Girl  
  
Cinnamon Girl of mixed heritage  
Never knew the meaning of color lines  
Nine one one turned that all around  
When she got accused of this crime  
  
So began the mass illusion, war on terror alibi  
What's the use when the god of confusion keeps on telling the same lie?  
  
Cinnamon Girl  
  
Don't cry, don't shed no tears  
1 night won't make us feel  
Cause we know how this movie's ending  
  
Cinnamon Girl  
  
As war drums beat in Babylon  
And scorch the blood red sky  
Militants bomb the foreign gun  
Both sides truly die  
  
Cinnamon girl opens the book she knows will settle all the scores  
Then she prays after the war that there will not be anymore  
  
Cinnamon Girl

Mary, Claire, Denise and Belle  
Best friends as far as I could tell  
Cheerleaders except for Denise  
She was the wild one  
She was the beast  
She was the one who named the group  
The original gang of four  
Mary, Claire, Denise and Belle  
Circle Of Amore  
  
Tenth grade Central in September  
That was a year I remember  
On this chilly cold afternoon  
I overheard the gang in the locker room  
Rendezvous, Mary's house  
Dirty words and wine  
Needless to say they all spend the day  
Just counting time, counting time  
Halfway through her history class  
Denise she kindly raised her hand and asked  
If she could be excused ("Can I be excused?")  
Then she ran from school (ran from school) in a hurry,  
The other girls, ooh they knew  
This is what friends are really for  
Mary, Claire, Denise and Belle  
Circle Of Amore  
  
Circle of amore  
  
Imagination showed a window (imagination)  
On a cold September day (ooh)  
Leaves are brown (brown), passion sounds (ooh)  
Memory self astray  
Four hands in the place where the feet connect  
(Gang of four)  
Circle of sex  
In the vicious race to maturity  
They're almost phased from ecstasy  
Sweat upon the necks of dames  
Loser in the circle game  
Cause memories are worth so much more (so much more)  
Mary, Claire, Denise and Belle  
Circle Of Amore  
  
(Ooh)  
Mary, Claire, Denise and Belle

There was a girl in Paris whom he sent a letter 2  
Hoping she would answer back now wasn't that a foolhardy notion  
On the part of a sometimes lonely musician?  
Acting out a whim is only good 4 a condition of the heart  
  
There was a dame from London who insisted that he love her  
Then left him 4 a real prince from Arabia  
Now isn't that a shame  
That sometimes money buys you everything and nothing?  
Love - it only seems 2 buy a terminal condition of the heart  
  
Oh - thinking about you, driving me crazy  
Oh - my friends all say it's just a phase, but?  
Oh - every day is a yellow day  
I'm blinded by the daisies in your yard  
  
There was a woman from the ghetto  
Who made funny faces just like Clara Bow  
How was I 2 know that she would wear the same cologne as you  
And giggle the same giggle that you do?  
Whenever I would act a fool, the fool with a condition of the heart  
  
Oh - thinking about you, driving me crazy  
Oh - my friends all say it's just a phase, but?  
Oh - every single day is a yellow day  
I'm blinded by the daisies in your yard  
  
(There was a girl in Paris whom he sent a letter 2)  
There was a girl? Whom he sent a letter 2  
(Hoping she would answer back)  
She never answered back and now  
(Wasn't that a foolhardy notion?)  
He's got a condition of the heart

Baby, you've got to be from a different world  
Cause just one look from you could make an army surrender  
Baby, you've got to rescue me girl, girl  
A prisoner in love with the opposite gender  
  
I ain't sayin' you're better, baby, but I ain't sayin' you're not  
I ain't sayin' anything until you stop  
Never forget that 'cause baby, I'll be your jack of all trades  
A mind and body well made  
  
Crucial - baby, our love has got to be  
Crucial - everything from A to Z  
Crucial - you've got to show me everything, everything, everything  
  
Is that Old Man River knockin' at your door  
Sayin' that we got to let more than our feelings show?  
Baby, tonight don't hold nothin' back, I know you've got some more  
I'll give you mine if you give me yours  
  
I ain't sayin' you're better, baby, I ain't sayin' you're not  
I ain't sayin' anything until you stop  
Baby, don't hold me back 'cause baby, I.. baby I need a jack for all trades  
A mind and body well made  
  
Crucial - our love has got to be  
Crucial - every little thing from A to Z  
Crucial - you've got to show me everything, everything, everything

Say I don't mind  
What you do to me  
If you waste my time  
Then it's meant to be  
I called your number (Yes I did)  
Like you told me to  
  
[Chorus:]  
Like a puppet on a string  
I'm go'n dance and I'm go'n sing  
I will do most anything  
If you promise me da bang, bang, bang!  
  
Don't want to lie  
I just want to do it  
But some other guy (Baby)  
Has beat me to it  
If you're in love (Well)  
We're to of a kind (Yes we are)  
What good is your body, baby  
Without your mind (Not much)  
  
[Chorus]  
Hit me, niggas!  
  
So here's the story  
I'm here for you  
Without the boring  
Without the cool  
When you try to fake it (Baby)  
And you want to get through (You know what I'm talkin' about)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Bang, bang, bang!  
Yeah! Ooh!

Oh daddy  
Oh, sock it to me

Steady wishin' he could sleep in your bed  
Steady wishin' he was in your car

Four, oh (come on), your the best  
  
See all my critics wastin' time

All I ever want 2 do is play in your hair

Raise your cane (cane)  
What do you believe in?

Who is your God?  
You  
Is this reality or just another facade?

I want to top the rose petals that whisper sweet  
Come on  
So dark, dark, so dark  
So dark, dark, so dark  
  
Inside lookin' out my window  
I don't see nothin' but rain  
Sun up in the sky just a shinin' (just a shinin')  
Still I'm lost in my shadow of pain  
  
Like an innocent man that's on death row  
I don't understand what made you go  
And want to leave me baby  
Leave me in the dark  
  
Can you tell me, tell me?  
  
You took my sex and my money (money)  
Took all my self esteem, yes you did  
You had the nerve to think it was funny (funny)  
I never knew a bitch so mean, yes sir  
  
You absolutely drove a man to tears  
All I really know is that you sincerely  
You want to hurt me baby, oh yes you do  
You want to hurt me in the dark  
  
(Sunshine) Somebody make the sun shine  
(Dark cloud) Somebody take this dark cloud away  
  
Just as sure as Noah built the ark  
That's how sure  
That's how sure I am you broke my heart  
  
How could you baby, leave me in the dark?  
Baby, so dark  
So dark, dark, so dark  
Feel like the sun ain't never gonna shine  
You left me in the dark  
So dark, dark, so dark  
I don't know, I don't know why we ever had to part  
Baby, can't see a damn thing out my window it's so dark (so dark)  
(So dark, dark, so dark)  
  
Sometimes I want to curse the ground you walk on  
Even when I know that everything you feel I feel it to  
I want to curse you baby  
You left me in the dark  
And now I want to, I want to curse you baby  
For leavin' me alone, alone, alone  
You left me in the dark, yes you did  
  
And now all I want to say is  
In the dark  
Ow, you left me  
Ow, you left me  
It's like being on death row (In the dark)  
I don't understand why you had to go  
I don't understand why you (hurt me in the dark)  
Don't understand why you (hurt me in the dark)  
Don't understand why you hurt me (hurt me, hurt me)  
Hurt me (hurt me in, hurt me in)  
Hurt me, hurt me, hurt me (hurt me in the dark)  
Just leave me  
In the dark  
  
In the dark  
So dark, dark, so dark (In the dark)  
So dark, dark, so dark  
In the dark

(Hold... hold... hold onto your wits!)  
  
Break down  
This is a bust (Hold onto your wits!)  
All you sorry motherfuckers up against the wall  
If you don't play, bite the dust  
Cause in a couple of simple fuckin' phrases  
I'm gonna hip you to the fuckin' place of  
The brand new mad style, uh  
Cause these are the days of wild - hit me!  
  
[Repeat: 2X]  
(Hold onto your wits!)  
  
Pop guns and weed?  
Brother please!  
We're to wise for now, since the other 90's was better suited for that biz  
Back when Dick was fuckin' Liz  
Before soda pop had fizz  
Don't blame it on a jockstrap full of jizz  
Mentality so insane  
I got a Tech-9 to and it's called my brain  
Shoot another brother? Not today  
Death from envy is the only way  
Here I can tear shit up 'cause that's my style  
And these are the days of wild - hit me! (Hold onto your wits!)  
These are the days of wild (Hold onto your wits!)  
These are the days of wild  
  
Hooker, bitch and ho, I don't think so  
I only knew one and never told her though  
I thought about many times (Diss me?)  
But that's the kind of shit that make you check your mind  
Is your blood type the type that flows  
Or is your blood type the type just stereo?  
A woman every day should be thanked  
Not disrespected, not raped or spanked  
And if a woman ever said I did  
Uh, she's a motherfuckin' liar and I'm a set-up kid  
And I can tear shit up y'all 'cause that's my style  
And these are the days of wild - hit me! (Hold onto your wits!)  
These are the days of wild (Hold onto your wits!)  
  
Oh oh oh, by the way, I play guitar!  
  
Tennis shoes and caps, now that's phat  
Up until the day another want to laugh behind your back  
Sayin' we all look the same, huh  
God bless America, home of the brave  
I'd rather dress to make a woman stare  
I'm puttin' on somethin' that another won't dare  
It's a freezer burn compared to cool  
And if you still got loot, then who's the fool?  
Everybody want to take the stand  
Mind your own motherfucker, let a man be a man  
I can tear shit up y'all 'cause that's my style  
And these are the days of wild - hit me! (Hold onto your wits!)  
These are the days of wild - hit me! (Hold onto your wits!)  
These are the days of wild - hit me!  
  
Much props to the upside down double six  
Baddest, freezer burnin', head turnin', make a brother yearnin',  
Sister walkin' the face  
You know who you are  
For love  
  
[Repeat: 2X]  
(Hold onto your wits!)  
  
[Repeat to fade]  
Hit me!

Riding in my Thunderbird on the freeway  
I turned on my radio to hear some music play  
I got a silly rapper talking silly shit instead  
And the only good rapper is one that's dead on it  
  
Uh, Dead on it  
  
Shall we go back? (Yeah!)  
Let's go  
  
Negros from Brooklyn play the bass pretty good  
But the ones from Minneapolis play it like it oughta should  
A magnum fro is better when you got a poof on it  
And the to and fro is funky when the grease is dead on it  
  
(Funky dead on it)  
Uh, dead (on it) on it  
  
Shall we go back? Let's go  
  
They dead on it, wow  
  
See the rapper's problem usually stem from being tone deaf  
Pack the house then try to sing,  
There won't be no one left (ha ha) (on it)  
Parking lot's on fire, brothers peelin' out of the town  
They say in disgust, they singin' their guts  
Rappin' done let us down (down down)  
You got to be dead, on it  
  
Dead on it  
  
(dead)  
  
All the sisters like it when you lick 'em on the knees  
Don't believe me? (no)  
Try it once then stop, they'll be begging  
Please, please, please (please, please, please)  
Shoo be doo wa, dead on it  
What does that have 2 do with the funk?  
Nothing, but who's paying the bills?  
If you don't want to lick my knees, I'm sho' your mama will  
  
Uh, 'cause we, 'cause we, 'cause we dead on it  
  
Dead on it, on it  
  
My bed's a coffin, Dracula ain't got shit on me  
My nickname's Hell's-a-Poppin', I'm badder than the Wicked Witch  
I got a gold tooth, costs more than your house  
I got a diamond ring on four fingers, each one the size of a mouse  
  
They dead, they dead on it, on it  
  
Wait now, hang up, dial tone on the 3  
You know, you know, I'm busy, to scizzy  
Can't nobody fuck with me  
  
Cause I'm dead (on it, on it, on it)  
On it  
  
Shoo be doo wa wa, dead on it  
  
Dead on it, on it, on it  
  
Dang, dang, dang, dang, (dead on it) shoo be dang, dang, dang, dead on it  
Dead, dead on it

One after the other,  
The banished ones fled as they watched from  
The distance the destruction of the digital garden.  
  
With no more fruit to bear from its trees,  
The haze was finally broken.  
  
With the rains came the awareness that never again  
Would anyone ever lay claim to the treasures of the Rainbow Children.  
  
As though awakened from a dream,  
The muse opened her eyes. This time as queen.

This will be the day  
That you will hear me say  
That I will never run away  
  
I am here for you  
Love is meant for two  
Now tell me what you're gonna do  
  
If I gave you diamonds and pearls  
Would you be a happy boy or a girl  
If I could I would give you the world  
But all I can do is just offer you my love  
  
Which one of us is right  
If we always fight  
Why can't we just let love decide (Let love decide)  
  
Am I the weaker man  
Because I understand  
That love must be the master plan (Love is the master plan)  
  
If I gave you diamonds and pearls  
Would you be a happy boy or a girl  
If I could I would give you the world  
But all I can do is just offer you my love  
  
D to the I to the A to the M  
O to the N to the D to the pearls of love  
D to the I to the A to the M (To the M)  
O to the N to the D to the pearls of love  
  
There will come a time (There will come a time)  
When love will blow your mind (Blow your mind)  
And everything you'll look for you'll find (Take a look inside)  
  
That will be the time (That will be the time)  
That everything will shine (Forever)  
So bright it makes you colorblind (you will be color blind)  
  
If I gave you diamonds and pearls  
Would you be a happy boy or a girl  
If I could I would give you the world  
All I can do is just offer you my love  
  
If I gave you diamonds and pearls (Pearls)  
Would you be a happy boy or a girl (Yeah yeah)  
If I could I would give you the world (Give you the world)  
All I can do is just offer you my love (All I can do)  
  
If I gave you diamonds and pearls (Diamonds)  
Would you be, would you, would you  
(Would ya, would ya, would ya be happy little baby)  
A happy boy or a girl  
If I could I would give you the world

Dig you better dead, I'd dig you better dead (I'd dig you)  
Dig you better dead, I'd dig you better dead  
Dig you better dead, I'd dig you better dead (I'd dig you)  
Dig you better dead, I'd dig you better dead  
  
A long time ago, you took six months a walkin'  
Talkin' on the other side  
What started as an experiment  
Turned into a heaven-sent message that saved your ass from dyin'  
Somebody said  
  
[Chorus]  
"In life there's always peaks and valleys,  
And if you're lost they won't show you the way"  
That same somebody said "I'd dig you better dead  
But I'd much rather see if your God is what you say, say, say"  
  
And with the awesome power they struck  
1st they offered up the buck  
Right in the middle, right in the middle they stuck (right in the middle)  
A toke or to, what the fuck? (what the fuck?)  
  
One minute you're hot  
Tell the truth and you're not  
That's the noose that they hang on a goose like you  
Somebody said  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Dig you better dead, I'd dig you better dead [Repeat: x4]  
  
And whatever you do, don't make somebody happy  
Don't dress to freaky and make their daughters stare  
Then you'll find out how deep the valley truly be  
If you plan on catchin' the bus, you better have plenty fare  
Somebody said  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Dig you better dead, I'd dig you better dead  
Dig you better dead, I'd dig you better dead  
Dig, dig, dig you better dead  
I'd dig, dig you better dead  
Somebody said  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'd dig you better dead, I'd dig you better dead  
Dig you better dead, I'd dig you better dead [Repeat: x3]

Dinner with Delores  
Must be some kind of sin  
Like a Brontosaurus  
She was packin' it in  
The first night we dined  
And by the next time  
This girl was eatin' all but the tip  
  
And by the stroke of midnight  
She wanted some more (more)  
Showin' dirty movies  
Like some kind of whore  
But she was wastin' her time  
Cause there wasn't a line  
That would make me come 'round her door  
  
Dinner with Delores  
Must be some kind of sin  
Her bell's just a-broken (bell's just broken)  
Since 1984  
(Dancin') Dancin' like a white girl (white girl)  
On disco dirty floors  
Damn, Delores, pick another subject please  
Introduce the carpet 2 something other than your knees  
  
Like a real confession  
No one could be more made up than you  
Nothin's left for guessin'  
What a shame  
(Boo hoo) Boo hoo  
  
(Delores)  
(Delores)  
  
I'd call you a friend  
But it must be a sin  
And I've run out of cheeks to turn  
  
Dinner with Delores  
No more  
That's the end

Pardon me, I want to talk to you  
I may be kinda shy But I just gotta tell you  
What I'm going to do  
Someone over there says He wants to get to know you  
I don't care 'cause  
I really want to hold you  
And I'm so scared  
(he might do something)  
To you that you like  
Now I've been waiting  
Such a bloody long time  
Just to get this close to you  
Now that you're near me  
I want you to hear me  
I'll tell you what I want to do  
Oh, I want to do it  
Do it all night  
I want to do it  
Do it to you right  
Giving up so easy  
Is something that I never do  
But I'm so easy, so easy  
When it comes to loving you Can't you understand that I want  
To hug and kiss you  
I'll do anything I can just  
To give you happiness  
And I drown, baby, drown, baby  
In your arms, c'mon baby  
Can't you get to this?  
I've been waiting such a bloody long time  
And you're talking to someone else  
Now that I've got your attention  
There's something I want to mention  
  
I want to do it  
Do it all night  
I want to do it, oh yeah  
Do it to you right  
Do it all night

Here we are in this big old empty room, staring each other down  
You want me just as much as I want you, let's stop fooling around  
Take me baby, kiss me all over, play with my love  
Bring out what's been in me for far too long  
Baby, you know that's all I've been dreaming of  
Do me baby, like you never done before  
Give it to me till I just can't take no more  
Do me baby, like you never done before  
I want you now, I just can't wait no more, can't wait  
  
Here we are looking for a reason for you to lay me down  
For a love like ours is never out of season, so baby please stop teasing me  
What ya do, I can never love no other, you're the best I ever had  
Whenever we're not close to one another, I just want you so bad  
  
So do me baby, like you never done before  
Give it to me till I just can't take no more  
C'mon, do me baby, like you never done before  
I want you now, I just can't wait no more  
  
I said...  
Do me baby, do me baby, give it to me  
Do me baby, I want you now  
Do me baby, give it to me  
Do me baby, do me baby, don't want to do it all alone  
I want your love.  
Do me baby, give it to me  
Do me baby, this feeling is too strong, make me wait 2 long, I want you now  
  
You're leaving me no choice  
OK, what are you gonna do, you just gonna sit there and watch? alright,  
Are you sure you don't want to close your eyes?  
Well, isn't it supposed to take a long time?  
I'm not gonna stop till the war is over  
Help me! there, OK, OK  
I'm so cold, just hold me

How beautiful do the words have to be  
Before they conquer every heart?  
How will you know if I'm even in the right key  
If you make me stop before I start?  
  
[Chorus]  
If I came back as a dolphin  
Would you listen to me then?  
Would you let me be your friend?  
Would you let me in?  
You can cut off all my fins  
But to your ways I will not bend  
I'll die before I let you tell me how to swim  
And I'll come back again as a dolphin  
  
Why does my brother have to go hungry  
When you told him there was food for all?  
This is the man that stands next to the man  
That stands to catch you when you fall (Oh!)  
  
If I'm under water, will you find me? (Find me)  
Will you shine a light and try to guide me?  
It's happened before, I've knocked on your door  
But you wouldn't let me in  
  
How beautiful do the words have to be  
Before they conquer every heart? (Oh!)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(I'll come back, baby)  
(Let me in, let me in) As a dolphin  
(Be my friend) Dolphin  
(Yeah, yeah)  
  
Dolphin  
As a dolphin  
As a dolphin  
As a dolphin

Donna, pretty as you can be (So pretty)  
Oh pretty Donna, when will you ever see (When will you ever see?)

And I believe he'll try 2 keep you anyway he can  
Donna, I guess it's not meant 2 be  
  
Donna, pretty as you can be  
Donna, when will you ever see (When will you ever see? [x2])  
That you belong 2 another man?  
And I think he will try 2 keep you anyway he can  
Donna, I guess it's not meant 2..

Last time

Don't play me  
I'm over thirty and I don't smoke weed  
I put my ass away and music I've played  
Ain't the type of stereo you're tryin' to feed  
Don't play me  
Don't play me  
I use proper English and I'm straight  
I'm in the news again for paying dues my friend  
And not the type of ganda you prop in my way  
Don't play me  
  
Don't play me  
I've been to the mountain top and it ain't what you say  
Don't play me  
  
Don't play me  
I'm the wrong color and I play guitar  
My only competition is well in the past  
Time and time if time existed movin' ever so fast  
Don't play me  
  
You couldn't play enough of me now  
To make me feel like a star  
Don't play me I already do in my car  
Don't play me  
  
Don't be mad at me  
The curtain puller in the game  
Maybe how you call us 'niggers' ain't the same  
It's all good when you know the only fame  
Is the light that comes from God and the joy you get to say his name  
Don't play me  
  
Don't play me  
I've seen to the mountain top and it ain't what you say  
Don't play me  
  
Already got laid

Performed by Prince  
Little darling  
Gotta go now  
Don't know when I'll be coming back  
Got my future  
All planned out  
Got my bags packed  
Things don't always turn out right  
That's just the way it goes  
Before I leave you there's just a few things you should know  
  
Don't talk 2 strangers  
Don't forget to say your prayers at night  
Remember god he made you  
And one day he'll make everything alright  
Don't cross on yellow  
you always got to wait 4 a green light  
Remember god he made you  
One day he'll make everything alright  
  
Alright  
Little darling  
Gotta go now  
Don't worry you'll be just fine  
When it comes 2 good luck  
I just know, I just know you'll always be the first in line  
Nobody'll ever love you as much as I do  
That doesn't mean other people won't love you 2  
Don't talk 2 strangers  
Don't forget 2 say your prayers at night  
Remember god he made you  
And one day he'll make everything alright  
Don't cross on yellow  
you always got to wait 4 a green light  
Remember god he made you  
And one day he'll make things alright  
  
Alright  
Make everything alright  
Alright  
  
Little darling  
Gotta go now  
Got my future all planned out  
Before I go  
Don't talk 2 strangers  
Don't forget to say your prayers at night  
Remember god he made you  
One day he'll make everything alright

This is what it's like in the Dream Factory, oh!  
  
Hollyrock ain't all it seems (Lordy)  
Don't get too serious, it's just a dream  
Don't forget your friends, they're all you've got (Lordy)  
Listen to the story of a man I am not  
  
Party all night, hangin' out  
In the streets more than I be at home  
I take a pill to wipe away my doubts  
But a pill can't cure my bein' alone  
Vodka and seven straight to my brain  
Put me under false impressions, hide all my pain  
Somebody help me, I'm losing control  
  
This is what it's like in the Dream Factory, oh!  
  
Everybody got the big dreams (Hey Lordy)  
But nobody got the bucks  
Love and trust will help you make it in a world (Everybody)  
Where there ain't no love, ain't no love  
  
Dig...  
A man came up to me, smile in his eyes  
He told me I was a saint  
So I'm quittin' my friends much to their surprise  
I can't live up to the picture that they paint  
Ah somebody help me, I'm losing control (Ow!)  
  
I guess I'm just a sucker in the dream factory, oh!  
  
Lordy  
La, la, la, la, la (Sucker)  
Got to drive  
[Repeat: 3X]  
(It's just a dream)  
Look out  
  
Do you want to party?  
Do want a pill?  
How about a false impression?  
(Thrills, spills, chills)  
  
This is what it's like in the Dream Factory, oh!  
  
Ow! Yeah  
Up a little bit  
(Dream factory, oh)  
Party all night, hang up on the side, I said "Uh"  
(Do you want to party?)  
I can't make up my mind  
(How about a false impression?)  
I can't seem to live with no pictures (Thrills, spills, chills)  
Somebody got to help me! (Just a sucker)  
I'm losing control (Just a sucker)  
I guess I'm just a sucker in the dream factory, oh!  
  
Guess I'm just a sucker in the dream factory, oh!  
(Just a sucker, motherfucker!)

If the wind blew every petal from your precious red rose  
Would you be afraid of what you'd find inside?  
When I'm alone in my room  
I can't stop dreaming about you, dreaming about you  
When I'm alone in my room  
I can't stop dreaming about you, dreaming about you  
And every time I do what I need to do  
I can't stop dreaming about you, dreaming about you  
  
Revolving around every word that is spoken  
Like the planets around the sun  
I want you  
Your tongue is a great persuader  
Yeah, you got me sold  
And when I'm alone in my room just watching a rose  
I dream about you, I dream about you  
  
When I'm alone in my room, yeah  
I can't stop dreaming about you  
When I'm alone in my room, baby, baby  
I can't stop dreaming about you, dreaming about you  
And every time I do what I need to do  
I can't stop dreaming about you, dreaming about you  
  
When my sane twin reigns  
Claiming your aim is to maim my subconscious into being with you  
I dream about you  
Betting on the notion that if my lustier twin prevails  
Like the ruins of Rome, I'll lie helpless at your feet  
Yeah, when I'm alone  
I dream about you, I dream about you  
  
I dream about you, baby  
When I'm alone in my room  
I dream about you, my baby  
I dream about you, you, you  
  
(And here we stand)  
And here we stand amidst your core (you)  
Like the petals on this rose I adore (you)  
The inside (The inside)  
If the inside is kind  
Kind in a sense that one would come from all  
And the wish that you wish will come true if you call  
But if not, (you will fall) you will fall  
And I'll still be alone (Just dreaming about you)  
With this ball in my stomach just dreaming about you (Dreaming about you)

Ooh, look at me, I'm a Cadillac  
I'm a brand new convertible child  
I've never been driven baby, U're the first  
Come on baby, drive me wild... Ooh  
  
Ooh, look at me, I'm a telephone  
Whatever you want, just dial  
Come on honey, please, it's so easy  
Do it baby, drive me wild  
  
Chorus:  
Come on baby, do it, drive me wild  
Do it baby, drive me wild  
Come on baby, do it, drive me wild  
Do it baby, drive me wild  
  
Ooh, look at me, I'm a radio  
Call me up, make a request  
I'll do anything, just name it  
When I'm bad, baby, I'm the best  
  
Chorus  
  
Ooh  
  
Ooh, look at me, I'm a baby doll  
Just pick me up and I'll smile  
I may be young but I'm a whole lotta fun  
Come on, baby, drive me wild  
  
Chorus  
  
Ooh, do it, drive me wild  
Come on baby, drive me wild  
Ooh, do it, drive me wild  
Come on baby, drive me wild  
Drive me wild, drive me wild

I saw your friend 1st  
That's who I danced with  
All the time I was watchin' you  
  
The music rocked us  
Our eyes locked-thus  
Makin' us see a trippy picture shoo  
  
If a man is considered guilty  
For what goes on in his mind  
Then give me the electric chair  
For all my future crimes-oh!  
  
You whispered something  
It took my mind out like a  
G flat major with an E in the bass  
Your face looked so good  
I wanted to touch your mouth  
My brain is jackin' all over the place  
  
If a man is considered guilty  
For what goes on in his mind  
Then give me the electric chair  
For all my future crimes-oh!  
  
Let's take a drive, love  
So we can make up our minds, love  
To commit the crimes of passion  
That sets us free  
Me lovin' you, you lovin' me (me lovin' you, you lovin' me)  
  
The electric chair  
  
I saw your friend 1st  
That's who I danced with  
All the time I was watchin' you (I was watchin' you)  
The music rocked us  
Our lives shocked us  
Makin' us see a trippy picture shoo  
I've got to have it  
Somebody  
  
If a man is considered guilty  
For what goes on in his mind  
Then give me the electric chair  
For all my future crimes-oh!  
  
You know I'm guilty, yeah, (for all my future crimes)  
Guilty, (for all my future crimes)  
And if ya don't really love me  
(Then give me the electric chair) oh!  
  
Electric chair

Boy is lonely on a burning hot summer night  
He's looking for some action, he's looking 4 a fight  
He's looking for a savior in a city full of fools  
Maybe he just needs a good talker to give him a good talking to.  
Can we talk baby? Strip down, strip down.  
I think I'm gonna fall in love tonight.  
  
Elephants and flowers, hot sweaty light paints a picture red and gold  
On a crowd of naked bodies stripped down to their very souls  
How can he find a shy angel in a city so bold (so bold)  
He can't even find a place to dance, this is rock and roll.  
Strip down, strip down, elephants and flowers  
Is everybody ready? Here we go.  
  
Love the one who is love, (love) the one who gives us the power, (power)  
The one who made everything, (what?) elephants and flowers (what will he do?)  
The one who will listen when all others will not.  
There will be peace for those who love god a lot.  
  
Elephants and flowers, strip down.  
Think I'm gonna fall in love tonight.  
When I do, there won't be no more (confusion)  
There won't be no more (no tears)  
There won't be no more enemies, so that eliminates all the fear  
And there won't be no sorrow, (sorrow)  
There won't be no pain, (no pain)  
There won't be no ball and no chain  
Strip down, strip down, elephants and flowers.  
  
Boy is lonely on a burning hot summer night  
He's looking for an angel to hold him 'til the morning light  
Here we go.  
  
Love the one who is love, (well) the one who gives us the power, (power)  
The one who made everything, (everything) elephants and flowers (oh, yeah)  
The one who will listen when all others will not. (all others will not)  
There will be peace for those who love god a lot.  
Here we go.  
  
Love the one who is love, (love) the one who gives us the power, (power)  
The one who made everything, (what?) elephants and flowers (what will he do?)

Her love would only even the score  
It seemed her darling fella  
He stole a hell of a lot of bucks from the corner store  
The declaration of war that followed  
She never believed, oh  
  
In the darkest corners where widows mourn  
That's where he whispered her name  
He said, "We can do it here, my dear  
But I fear your tears will fall like rain"  
They fall like  
  
"Because I must tell you (Tell U)  
While I'm deep in your smell  
You got the man I want to inflict with pain  
I'm running a game with my paper  
I'm turning the boy to vapor  
Now I want to do the same to you  
If you don't tattoo my name upon your train"

I only want to feel you up  
I don't really want to be your man

Physical attraction babe

Hot and cold reaction  
Feel you up  
Turn you out

Something 'bout the way you walk just really blows my mind  
I never wanted anything so much  
Ok?

Don't sleep 'til the sunrise, listen to the falling rain  
Don't worry 'bout tomorrow, don't worry 'bout your pain  
Don't cry unless you're happy, don't smile unless you're blue  
Never let that lonely monster take control of you  
  
[Chorus]  
Be glad that you are free  
Free to change your mind  
Free to go most anywhere, anytime  
Be glad that you are free  
There's many a man who's not  
Be glad for what you had baby, what you've got  
Be glad for what you've got  
  
I know (my?) heart is beating, my drummer tells me so  
If you take your life for granted, your beating heart will go  
So don't sleep until you're guilty, cause sinners all are we  
There's others doing far worse than us, so be glad that you are free  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Soldiers are a marching, they're writing brand new laws  
Will we all fight together for the most important cause?  
Will we all fight for the right to be free?  
Free (Be glad that you are free)  
Free to change my mind (Free to change your mind)  
Free to go most anywhere, anytime (Free to go most anywhere,anytime)  
I'm just glad, I'm just glad I'm free, yeah (Be glad that you are free)  
There's many a man who's not (There's many a man who's not)  
Glad for what I had baby, (Be glad for what you had and)  
Glad for what I got, oh yeah (for what you've got)  
Oh I'm just glad, I'm just glad I'm free,yeah (Be glad that you are free)  
Free to change my mind (Free to change your mind)  
Free to go most anywhere, anytime (Free to go most anywhere, anytime)  
(Be glad that you are free)  
(There's many a man who's not)  
I'm so (Be glad for what you had and for)  
(what you've got)

[segued from "Love, Thy Will Be Done"]  
Y'all like that shit we just did at the end?  
Y'all wanna get funky?  
Aww shit!  
  
Mayte's in the kitchen stirring up the pot  
Brother's out here waiting, trying 2 see what she got  
What she trying 2 show me, is not from the Golden Rule  
  
This here funk, y'all, listen 2 me, U can't learn it  
in school  
  
[Chorus:]  
Let's get funky, yeah!  
Get it on, right on!  
Everyday!  
  
Morris on the organ, a-gettin' real funky  
Tommy on piano, gettin' funky 2  
Michael B. on the drum uh, gettin' real funky  
I got something that I wanna shake 4 U  
  
[Chorus]  
  
People in the front row, U know U get funky  
People upstairs, U know U're real funky 2  
NPG, we know we're funky  
Cuz we do everything and anything we want 2  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah!  
Is it funky? [x2]  
Alright! This is alright!  
  
Funky, yeah!

I've heard it said my lovers look alike  
Could it be that I was looking for you  
They were cool but something wasn't right  
They had me fooled for a minute and then I saw the truth  
  
None of them got what it takes  
To be a future baby mama  
Gotta bend in the wind, but don't break  
To keep your man  
  
Show me one of them and I'll make her mine  
With no more drama  
Future baby mama  
I've heard it said that I won't treat you right  
(U know that ain't right babe)  
But they ain't sure because they don't know nothing about you  
(U know what you want baby)  
You're too secure to ever want to fuss and fight  
(That's right)  
  
That's why your man never ever got a reason to doubt you  
Yeah I know you might be fine but I've seen it all before  
Cinderella was a waste of time and oops she's out the door  
To build a house together the thing that matters more  
  
Is under the floor  
A strong foundation that last forever more  
I want to make you happy, baby  
(Oh yes)  
Happier than happy itself  
(Oh yes)  
You know what?  
  
If you'll ever need a hand, call me I'll help  
Because I got you, anywhere you wanna go, uh  
(Oh yes)  
Paris, London, Africa, San Lucas Mexico, you see  
  
I know what you want  
What every good woman wants  
A man so in love with you  
He can't help but to flaunt you  
Deep down I know what you want  
You want your girlfriends to hate you  
Because they can't get your man
