Can't get down I've seen the light  
I made the choice and chose the right  
I'll put in trust take out the hate  
Don't tell me I can't cause I have faith  
I have faith in people they have faith in me  
I have faith in my society  
If you've got a problem put your trust in me  
I'll never pretend that I can't see  
I have faith in the human race  
The world's got problems  
The world's got fears  
But my trust in people  
Makes me not scared  
The world's got riots  
The world's got fights  
But I trust people will see the light  
  
  

Waving your flag a blind patriot  
Can no longer see cause your eyes are shut  
Love it or leave it is your sentiment  
Instead of working for improvement  
But I want to live free  
And won't settle for this mediocrity  
Waving your flag, we're number one  
Society's got you under their thumb  
Too ignorant too see through their subtle attack  
To make us content but we must fight back  
You don't love your country  
You just love yourself  
Because you sit complacent  
Like everyone else  
If your fights for freedom  
Then do what's right  
Put down that flag, protest and come join the fight  
  

I see you hide  
Do you have pride  
Afraid to share what's inside  
You've been walked right by  
A real nice guy  
Overlooked and shoved aside  
Can't hear your voice back in the crowd  
Move up fornt and shout out loud !  
Take a stand !  
Take a stand, say what you feel  
Be who you want, but be for real!  
Voice your opinion,  
Don't just sit still  
Speak your mind at your free will  
Take a stand !  
Stand your ground  
Don't let the world push you around  
Take a stand !  
Stand your ground  
Don't let the world push you around !  
  

Life's filled with many paths  
Which one should I take ?  
When the choice comes, I won't run  
I'll be thinking straight !  
Life's filled with conflicts... we'll face  
We'll overcom them... thinking straight !  
Experiment with your mind  
You see things I can't see  
Well no thanks, friend  
Because now it ends when you push that shit on me!  
My mind is free to think and see.  
Strong enough to resist temptation  
We've been strong for all these years  
Yes, life gets rough, so we'll stand tough and confront  
All our fears!  
  

Growing up with kids  
I can truly call my friends  
There from the beginning  
And they'll be there until the end  
Together we've built this  
And all done our part  
Together we've stood here  
Right from the start  
With all these great experiences  
I know I won't forget  
All the places that we've traveled  
And the people we've fucking met  
Together we've built this  
And all done our part  
Together we've stood here  
Right from the start  
I will never forget  
All that we've done  
All that it's meant  
There's a youth culture rising  
In front of your eyes  
Take pieces of you in my memory  
Until the day I die  
Together we've built this  
And all done our part  
Together we've stood here  
Right from the start

Wake up and live  
Wake up and live your life see what there is to see  
I won't sit around all day cause life means more to me  
Wake up and live  
So many kids content to sleep their lives away  
But I'm gona try to make the most out of this day  
Wake up and live  
It takes some motivation It takes some love for life  
Why just sit complacent and let life pass you by  
Boredom is a choice I choose not to make  
Unlock that door, strive for more  
There's a better path to take  
WAKE UP AND LIVE breath every breath  
WAKE UP AND LIVE until my death  
WAKE UP AND LIVE so much to do  
WAKE UP AND LIVE all of you  
C'mon, open your eyes  
  

A half-ass commitment, a casual act  
Shows me the decency that you lack  
You're fucking with feelings and fucking with heads  
And live for the moment is all that you've said  
What goes around comes around  
So watch yourself cause you're falling down  
Abusing, misusing you're out of control  
Your mind, spirit and body will take their toll  
A slave to your senses, I see nothing more  
Cause temporary pleasure is what you strive for  
Taken what you've wanted, stepped on what's in your way  
But there will be a price that you'll have to pay  
Easy acquaintances, broken friends  
Happy now but the loser in the end  
Broken promises, broken hearts  
Walk away when the pain starts  
You take what's yours you still want more  
If you only knew what's in store
