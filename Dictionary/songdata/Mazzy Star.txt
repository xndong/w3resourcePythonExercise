Bells ring into the night  
Sounds like a mystery sonnet at night  
Hold your throat and I'll come together  
And see the light that goes away  
Leave my heart down by the water  
It sleeps inside my soul  
It isn't true about your father  
Just hold me down by the water  
This ? black as the moonlight  
Look up to see your weakness in the sky  
Nobody's out to buy your story  
Nobody wants to know your reason why  
Hold your hands and throw the water  
In front of me to know how I feel  
Don't put it all into your hero  
You're gone, feeling  
You're gone, feeling  
You're gone, feeling  
Don't want to say that I'm through with it  
Just want to be like I am inside  
Right by your side

Waitin' for a sign from you  
Waitin' for a signal to change  
Have you forgotten what your love can do?  
Is this the end?  
  
Walkin' through the city  
Your boots are high-hilled and are shinin' bright  
The sun was sparklin' on the shaft of your knife  
Flower in the morning rain  
Dying in my hand  
  
Was it all in vain?  
Superstar in your own private movie  
I wanted just a minor part  
But I'm no fool  
I know you're cool  
I never really wanted your heart  
  
You're the keeper of the key  
Nothing seems to bring you down  
It's not that cool when I'm around  
Flower in the morning rain  
Dying in my hand  
  
Was it all in vain?  
Superstar in your own bright movie  
I wanted just a minor part  
But I'm no fool  
I know you're cool  
I never really wanted your heart  

There's a blue light in my best friend's room  
There's a blue light in his eyes  
There's a blue light, yeah  
I wanna see it shine  
There's a ship that sails by my window  
There's a ship that sails on by  
There's a world under it  
I think I see it sailing away  
I think it's sailing miles  
Crashing me by  
Crashing me by  
Crashing me by  
There's a world outside my doorstep  
Flames over everyone hot  
Don't you see them shining  
I wanna hear them beating for me  
I think I hear them waves  
Crashing me by  
Crashing me by  
Crashing me by

I wanna hold the hand inside you  
I wanna take a breath that's true  
I look to you and I see nothing  
I look to you to see the truth  
  
You live your life, you go in shadows  
You'll come apart and you'll go blind  
Some kind of light into your darkness  
Colors your eyes with what's not there  
  
Fade into you  
Strange you never knew  
Fade into you  
I think it's strange you never knew  
  
A stranger's light comes on slowly  
A stranger's heart without a home  
You put your hands into your head  
And then smiles cover your heart

I fell asleep in the silence  
Before the street fights the fire  
Free in the world that you've given  
Lay in the sound,  
The water still calls,  
Still calls  
Afraid of the dark that surrounds me  
Hide in the dirt of the ground  
Free in the wind that surrounds me  
I'm not afraid to sleep in the night  
Not afraid,  
To sleep in the night  
Free like a bird of the holders  
Holding the wake of the sun  
I know the road that you send me  
I know the way it leads to home  
Real like the bones in my body  
Real like the flesh that covers the grave  
It's real,  
Like the flesh  
That covers, The grave  
Wait for the guards that you send me  
Before I'll show myself,  
Wait for the storm that comes to me  
Maybe I'll just change my mind  
Plea for the will of forgiveness  
I'm not afraid to say I was wrong  
I was wrong  
Maybe I won't  
So long  
So long  

Your hair and your eyes  
I saw them in the night  
Your face, your disguise  
I felt it in the night  
Your cool clammy skin  
It could be right beside me  
I saw you swimmin' over here  
You looked so fragile  
And don't you know her eyes were red?  
Your hair and your skin  
I know my desire  
I felt akin  
To my desire  
Your eyes and your face  
I dreamed them in the night  
Your hair and your skin  
I saw them swimmin' over here  
And don't you know you're life itself?

Well I think I see another side  
Maybe just another light that shines  
And I look over now through the door  
And I still belong to no one else  
Maybe I hold you to blame for all the reasons that you left.  
And close my eyes 'till I see your surprise  
And you're leaving before my time.  
Baby won't you change your mind?  
  
Surely don't stay long I'm missing you now.  
It's like I told you I'm over you somehow  
Before I close the door  
I need to hear you say goodbye.  
Baby won't you change your mind?  
  
I guess that hasn't changed someone  
Maybe nobody else could understand  
I guess that you believe you are a woman  
And that I am someone else's man  
But just before I see that you leave  
I want you to hold on to things that you said  
Baby I wish I were dead.  
  
Surely don't stay long I'm missing you now.  
It's like I told you I'm over you somehow  
Before I close the door  
I need to hear you say goodbye  
Baby won't you change your mind?  

I've got a brand new skillet and a brand new lid  
I ain't got no stove, but I'll bake my bread  
I'm gonna bake my biscuit  
I'm gonna bake my biscuit  
I'm gonna bake my biscuit  
Ain't gonna give nobody no  
I'm gonna lock my doors, keep my windows all down  
You know about that, I want no bones around  
I'm gonna bake my biscuit  
I'm gonna bake my biscuit  
I'm gonna bake my biscuit  
Ain't gonna give nobody no  
I ain't got no flour, I ain't got no meal  
If you got no man, you've got to rob and steal  
I'm gonna bake my biscuit  
I'm gonna bake my biscuit  
I'm gonna bake my biscuit  
Ain't gonna give nobody no  
I'm might tell you somethin', don't know if I'm right  
But if you want my bread, you got to stay all night  
I'm gonna bake my biscuit  
I'm gonna bake my biscuit  
I'm gonna bake my biscuit  
Ain't gonna give nobody no  
Come here, come here, won't you come here now  
Boy, I ain't got time cause my bread ain't brown  
I'm gonna bake my biscuit  
I'm gonna bake my biscuit  
I'm gonna bake my biscuit  
Ain't gonna give nobody no  

I'm sailin' sailin'  
To a place I've never seen  
That's way down south  
Sweet 'ol New Orleans  
Cause my hometown friend treats me awful mean  
  
If I could holler  
Yeah holler  
If I could scream and cry  
It hurts me so  
When I look up in the sky  
Cause my friends turn their heads  
As they pass me by  
  
Now it's rainin'  
It's rainin'  
The wind's blowin' cold  
Lord I thought I heard  
My train whistle blow  
Now I'm gonna sail so far  
Til I won't be back no more  
  
Pardon me, Pardon me  
It's so hard to stand  
I ain't got no money  
Uncle Sam has called my name  
Now there's not a soul  
To give me a helpin' hand  

Sometimes my life  
Is just a torch  
They go away  
And come back to me  
It's just no way  
It can be found  
It's a view  
Come on take it  
The touch of your hand  
It speaks the distance  
It speaks the distance  
In your heart  
Behind my life  
There's a silent storm  
It brings a vision  
Into your mind  
It's in between  
All the dark of hearts  
My heart beats and say  
Come on, there's question of why  
There's no question of why  
Beat your door  
To knock it through  
You took his watch  
His solitude  
In my eyes  
It may be  
Behind my eyes  
There's different kinds  
They go away  
And come back to me

Just like that, she follows me  
My wings under her tree  
She says one thing and that's just enough  
It doesn't matter how much  
  
Would I forget?  
Lay myself down  
Just to regret  
And that's all  
Would I forget?  
  
I'll go with her  
I'll never know how far, how long  
She keeps a diamond inside her door  
She doesn't have a clue  
  
Would I forget?  
Lay myself down  
Just to regret  
And that's all  
  
Would I forget?  
Lay myself down  
Just to regret  
And that's all  
  
And that's all  
And that's all

Look on down from the bridge  
There's still fountains down there  
Look on down from the bridge  
It's still raining, up here  
  
Everybody seems so far away from me  
Everybody just wants to be free  
Look away from the sky  
It's no different when you're leaving home  
I can't be the same thing to you now  
I'm just gone, just gone  
How could I say goodbye  
How could I say goodbye  
Goodbye  
  
Maybe I'll just place my hands over you  
And close my eyes real tight  
There's a light in your eyes  
And you know--yeah, you know  
Look on down from the bridge  
I'm still waiting for you  

Ride it on baby,  
Into my view  
Ride it on baby,  
Into your side  
Ride it on baby  
Just like you used to do  
Did you want me to love you, well,  
I'm just here for the call  
And you said that you're so low, well,  
I won't really do you any harm  
Won't you ride it on baby,  
Just like you used to do  
There's no love that you're over feeling  
And you still want to be with me  
But you're leaving like you said that you would  
I'm waiting for the call  
And you love like you always say now  
But you know it won't do you any harm  
Ride it on baby,  
Just like you said that you would  
Oh then ride it on baby,  
Just like you know it's understood  
Ride it on baby,  
It's still into your view  
Ride it on baby,  
I only want to be with you  
I'm dreaming that you're going far,  
And you lie, take and whine  
Won't you ride it on baby,  
But you're so heavy for the price  
Ride it on baby,  
Just like you said that you would  

You really had a million hearts to break  
Now it's time that I never left you in the moonlight  
How comes always someone else driving your car  
Taking you different places in the sunlight  
  
Still cold like the stars  
That's just the way you are  
Still cold like the stars  
  
You used to say your heart felt like a stone  
Now everything you ever wanted is your own  
  
Still cold like the stars  
That's just the way you are  
Still cold like the stars
