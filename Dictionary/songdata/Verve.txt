The radio plays the sounds we made  
And everything seems to feel just right  
Coming through your lonely mind  
Well I've seen things  
That scarred and bruised and left me blind  
So come on, listen along with me  
I think you need a little company  
  
And how long will I run for?  
Who am I running from?  
  
And it makes sense  
The youth coming up and making you dance  
'Cause I've got some living inside of me  
So come on I could use the company  
  
And how long will I run for?  
Who am I running from?  
But now I've seen my face in a cardboard wall  
Nobody comes, nobody calls  
  
How long will I run for?  
Who am I running from?  
Teenage tears sting my eyeballs  
In a town where I wasn't born  
And I will never suffer  
So come on, come on, come on  
But now I see my face in a cardboard wall  
Nobody comes, nobody calls  
  
If you're looking for me  
I'm there and it's you  
If you're looking for me out there it's true  
If you're looking for  
I'll be looking for you  
If you're looking for me  
Then I'm looking for you  
If you're looking for me  
Then I'm looking for you  
If you're looking for me  
Then I'm looking for you

So I got in the car  
We drove for a mile  
I didn't even learn her name  
She said: "You've got the money and I've got the time"  
  
Five years later on  
She became my lover  
Taught me everything I know  
She said: "You were born to fly my son"  
I said: "Hey! I already know"  
  
Because it's all inside  
Because it's all inside  
I was born to fly, fly pretty high  
  
Five years later on  
She became my father  
Taught me everything I know  
She said: "You were born to burn my love"  
I said: "Hey! I already know"  
  
[Chorus: Repeat 2X]  
  
So waste your time  
On people who don't know which way to go  
They'll never said you were, never said  
You were up in the sky  
Because it's all in the mind  
  
Just get in the car  
Turn out the light  
Don't care who you are  
You could be a star  
Or you could be a fool  
Don't care what I find  
It's all in the mind

Cause it's a bittersweet symphony this life  
Trying to make ends meet, you're a slave to the money then you die  
I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down  
You know the one that takes you to the places where all the veins meet, yeah  
No change, I can't change, I can't change, I can't change,  
But I'm here in my mold, I am here in my mold  
But I'm a million different people from one day to the next  
I can't change my mold, no, no, no, no, no, no, no  
  
Well I never pray,  
But tonight I'm on my knees, yeah  
I need to hear some sounds that recognize the pain in me, yeah  
I let the melody shine, let it cleanse my mind, I feel free now  
But the airwaves are clean and there's nobody singing to me now  
  
No change, I can't change, I can't change, I can't change,  
But I'm here in my mold, I am here in my mold  
And I'm a million different people from one day to the next  
I can't change my mold, no, no, no, no, no, no, no  
  
(Well have you ever been down?)  
(I can't change, I can't change)  
  
Cause it's a bittersweet symphony this life  
Trying to make ends meet, trying to find some money then you die  
You know I can't change, I can't change, I can't change,  
But I'm here in my mold, I am here in my mold  
And I'm a million different people from one day to the next  
I can't change my mold, no, no, no, no, no, no, no  
  
(I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down)  
(I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down)  
(It's just sex and violence melody and silence)  
(Been down)  
(Ever been down)  
(Ever been down)

There you were on the floor cut up  
And all alone I'll help you  
Conceived in a chrome dream I was a crease  
In the shirt that this world wears  
Till I met Blue, I was in obscurity he said  
Loosen up who do you want to be?  
  
We could steal a car and listen to the stars  
I can see you've choked on them too  
Had enough of late night films  
Just enough for an hour or two  
Oh Blue show me something new  
Oh Blue show me something new  
  
Blue, I've got a question every time I hold you  
Yeah, Blue, I've got a question every time I swallow you it's true  
  
Spike danced for 10 days long  
We were just heading for the sun  
You shot him down there's blood on my face  
His heart's in the right place  
What they gonna do to you  
What they gonna do  
Blue don't forget the word I warned you  
Oh Blue don't let them push you don't let them destroy you  
Meanwhile I'm searching with my brain blown eyes  
See the world through my dirty lonely mixed up mind

Drink the water to ease my pain  
Nights like these I only read about  
Nights like these I only dreamt about  
As we turned  
As we rolled  
I felt something strange  
I felt you  
Something light  
Something so bright  
I think it was the way of things  
I think it was the way of things  
Back come back again  
Get me a life  
Get me a life and see it in everything  
Through the dim light  
Through those dim lights  
I've fallen I'm falling falling falling falling  
In the endless life  
Endless life  
Endless life  
Endless life  
Endless life  
Endless life  
Endless life  
Endless life  
Endless life  
Endless life  
Endless life  
Endless life  
Endless life  
Endless life  
Endless life  
Endless life  
Endless life

Thank you  
This is our last one today  
Hope we get into a bit of a groove with it  
  
Get back, get back again and again  
I've been here since I can remember when  
My life is a boat, being blown by you  
With nothing ahead, just the deepest blue...  
  
To me you're like a setting sun  
You shine then you're gone  
To me you're like a setting sun  
You shine then you're gone  
  
Come back, come back again and again,  
I've been here since I can remember when  
Your world just spins whilst mine stands still  
Nothing's changed in my gravity grave  
  
To me you're like a setting sun  
You shine then you're gone  
To me you're like a setting sun  
You shine then you're gone  
  
To me you're like a setting sun  
You shine then you're gone  
To me you're like a setting sun  
You shine then you're gone  
But I want my life  
So bright it burns my eyes  
Sounds like the perfect way  
To end my life  
To me you're like a setting sun...  
To me you're like a setting sun...  
  
Get it on  
Get it on  
Whatever you want  
Whatever you want  
Whatever you want  
Whatever you want  
I'm gonna get me somehow  
Whatever you want  
Whatever you want  
I'm gonna get me somehow  
Whatever you want  
Whatever you want  
I'm gonna get me somehow  
Come on  
Come on  
Come on...  
Whatever you want  
Whatever you want  
Load up  
Load up  
Load up  
Load up  
Nothing's changed in my gravity grave  
My own world's stopped  
Your's still spins  
We could go up one more time  
We could go up one more  
One more  
One more  
One core  
One more  
One more  
One more  
Come on  
But we gotta go  
We got one minute left  
Come on  
We got one minute left  
Come on  
One minute  
One minute...  
Thank you  
Have a good weekend, all right?

I wander lonely streets  
Behind where the old Thames does flow  
And in every face I meet  
Reminds me of what I have run from  
In every man, in every hand  
In every kiss, you understand  
That living is for other men  
I hope you two will understand  
I've got to tell you my tale  
Of how I loved and how I failed  
I hope you understand  
I've got to tell you my tale  
Of how I loved and how I failed  
I hope you understand  
These feelings should not be in the man  
In every child, in every eye  
In every sky, above my head  
I hope that I know  
So come with me in bed  
Because it's you and me, we're history  
There ain't nothing left to say  
When I will get you alone  
Maybe we could find a room  
Where we could see what we should do  
Maybe you know it's true  
Living with me is like keeping a fool  
In every man, in every hand  
In every kiss, you understand  
That living is for other men  
I hope you know that I am me so come on  
I'm thinking about history  
And I'm living for history  
And I think you know about me  
'Cause I am  
And one and one is two  
But three is company  
When you're thinking about the things you do  
And you're thinking about the things you do  
I want to tell you my tale  
How I fell in love and jumped out on my bail  
I hope you understand there's more in a smile than in a hand  
In every sky, in every kiss  
There's something that I might have missed  
Why am I going to  
A place that now belongs to you  
But you were weak and so was I  
Let's pick it up, let's even try  
To live today, so why not smile  
Don't dream away your life 'Cause it is mine  
Is that a crime, is that a crime, this life is mine  
The bed ain't made but it's filled full of hope  
I've got a skin full of dope

Light...I see the light  
You're there on my floor  
You're there on my floor  
Fly...angel fly  
You're out of sight  
You're out of sight  
She came in a dream, Lord  
No way to describe it,  
It was in my head  
I burn but I don't scream  
No way to describe it,  
It is in my head  
I have seen things that I can't explain  
Looking in through that window pane  
Open your eyes and let me in  
Don't go to think that I don't care  
So...I see the door  
I see the door  
I see the door  
It came in a dream, Lord  
No way to describe it,  
It was in my head  
What's life without a scream, lover?  
No way to describe it,  
It was in my head  
I have seen things that I can't explain  
Looking through windows, feeling the same  
I have seen moments I'd like to share  
Scared that you don't want me there,  
My lover  
Scared that you don't want me there,  
My lover  
(It's a battle, it's a battle...)

Life's an ocean  
Too much commotion, too much emotion  
Dragging me down  
Living for today, don't have time to pray  
Ready for the game  
Take a line of fickle flame  
  
Imagine the future  
Woke up with a scream  
I was buying some feelings  
From a vending machine  
Say that I will see  
Something more than I have  
There's something inside of me  
Crying out for something else  
And if someone hears my scream  
Put it in a letter to me  
Slippery slimy road down  
  
Life's an ocean too much commotion  
  
Not enough emotion to satisfy me  
Slippery slidy road down  
It's slippery slidy road down  
  
Hold my hand and we'll walk down  
Dry those eyes and we'll walk down  
  
Slippery slidy road down  
Life's an ocean, life's an ocean  
Too much commotion, too much emotion

I heard you stirring in your sleep last night  
I was awake with something on my mind  
What happens when I leave, will you come with me?  
These things I guess I'll never know  
Tell me, who do you see when you die in your dreams?  
Tell me, who do you touch when you come in your dreams?  
I know that sometimes I get lost  
Been asking questions since the day I could talk  
Life is sweet but when my bones get cold  
Will you be there for me to hold?  
Tell me, who do you see when you die in your dreams?  
Tell me, who do you touch when you come in your dreams?  
Tell me, who do you see when you die in your dreams?  
Tell me, could it be yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
You holding me  
Oh Lord, I guess I'll never know (repeat)  
When you die in your dreams  
Oh Lord, I guess I'll never know  
Will I be holding you?  
Oh Lord, I guess I'll never know  
When I die in my sleep  
Oh Lord, I guess I'll never know  
Will I be holding you?  
Oh Lord, I guess I'll never know  
When you come in your dreams  
Oh Lord, I guess I'll never know  
Am I holding you  
Oh Lord, I guess I'll never know  
When you come in your dreams  
Oh Lord, I guess I'll never know  
Am I holding you  
Oh Lord, I guess I'll never know

Happiness  
More or less  
It's just a change in me  
Something in my liberty  
Oh, my, my  
Happiness  
Coming and going  
I watch you look at me  
Watch my fever growing  
I know just where I am  
  
But how many corners do I have to turn?  
How many times do I have to learn  
All the love I have is in my mind?  
  
Well, I'm a lucky man  
With fire in my hands  
  
Happiness  
Something in my own place  
I'm standing naked  
Smiling, I feel no disgrace  
With who I am  
  
Happiness  
Coming and going  
I watch you look at me  
Watch my fever growing  
I know just who I am  
  
But how many corners do I have to turn?  
How many times do I have to learn  
All the love I have is in my mind?  
  
I hope you understand  
I hope you understand  
  
Gotta love that'll never die  
  
Happiness  
More or less  
It's just a change in me  
Something in my liberty  
Happiness  
Coming and going  
I watch you look at me  
Watch my fever growing  
I know  
Oh, my, my  
Oh, my, my  
Oh, my, my  
Oh, my, my  
  
Gotta love that'll never die  
Gotta love that'll never die  
No, no  
I'm a lucky man  
  
It's just a change in me  
Something in my liberty  
It's just a change in me  
Something in my liberty  
It's just a change in me  
Something in my liberty  
Oh, my, my  
Oh, my, my  
It's just a change in me  
Something in my liberty  
Oh, my, my  
Oh, my, my

Hey my friend are we gonna make it till Monday?  
Another Friday night waiting for a revelation  
I can see a million faces in the condensation  
  
Hey my friend are we gonna make it till Monday?  
Hey my friend you better leave now  
I'm gonna go my own way  
You said I suffer from inner frustration  
  
In a moment you changed  
Now things weren't the same  
You were talking at me not with me  
And your tongue was burning up in flames  
Are you coming back?  
Are you coming back?  
When Monday comes you'll be alone  
With the whole world staring at you  
Better leave now

Dream...Dream...  
  
Damaged...do you see through the scream...  
Damaged...but I know I will survive  
Damaged...but I guess I'll move on...  
  
Dream...Dream...  
Live this life before your soul's a small grain, in the sky...  
  
Just keeping it, keeping it on, on ,on...  
Just keeping it, keeping it on, on on...  
Just keep it, keep it, keep it on, just keeping it, keep anything...  
  
Dream...Dream...  
Live this life before your soul's a small grain, in the sky  
  
Damaged...do you see through the scream  
Damaged...but I know I will survive  
Damaged...but I guess I'll move on  
  
To many people, to many dreams now, to many dreams now,  
I gonna come out now, I've gotta come back now...  
  
Dream...Dream...Yeah, dream  
Live your life before your soul's a small grain in the sky  
  
Dream...Dream...  
Live your life before your soul's a small grain in the sky

In a neon wilderness  
He was restless  
Escape loneliness  
Find a new address  
Stood before I sink  
In a neon wilderness  
Spill my last drink  
Yeah, he was restless  
Say good-bye to my new friends  
Escape from loneliness  
I found a new address  
In the last room  
I hear a boom  
Someone else's distress  
In a neon wilderness  
Someone else's distress  
In a neon wilderness  
And I hear a boom  
  
In a neon wilderness  
He was restless  
Escape loneliness  
For a new address  
  
In a neon wilderness  
He was restless  
Escape loneliness  
For a new address

Tell me what you seen  
Was it a dream?  
Was I in it?  
Life seems so obscene  
Until it's over  
Who knows?  
All I want is someone who can fill the hole  
In the life I know  
In between life and death  
When there's nothing left  
Do you wanna know?  
You come in on your own  
And you leave on your own  
Forget the lovers you've know  
And your friends on your own  
Tell me if it's true  
That I need you  
You are changing  
I've seen this road before down on this floor  
It is hurting me  
All I want is someone  
Who can fill the hole  
In the life I know  
In between life and death  
When there's nothing left  
Do you want to know?  
You come in on your own  
And you leave on your own  
Forget the lovers you've know  
And your friends on your own  
You come in on your own  
And you leave on your own  
Forget the lovers you've know  
And your friends you have told  
Lies  
I've got to get rid of this hole inside  
Lies  
I've got to get rid of this hole inside  
I'm coming in on my own  
I'm coming in on my own  
I'm coming in on my own  
Lies  
I've got to get rid of this hole inside  
Lies  
I've got to get rid of this hole inside  
Lies  
I've got to get rid of this hole inside...

One day maybe we will dance again  
Under fiery skies  
One day maybe you will love again  
Love that never dies  
  
One day maybe you will see the land  
Touch skin with sand  
You've been swimming in the lonely sea  
With no company  
  
Oh, don't you want to find?  
Can't you hear this beauty in life?  
The roads, the highs, breaking up your life  
Can't you hear this beauty in life?  
  
One day maybe you will cry again  
Just like a child  
You've gotta tie yourself to the mast my friend  
And the storm will end  
  
Oh, don't you want to find?  
Can't you hear this beauty in life?  
The times, the highs, breaking up your mind  
Can't you hear this beauty in life?  
  
Oh, you're too afraid to touch  
Too afraid you'll like it too much  
The roads, the times, breaking up your mind  
Can't you hear this beauty in life?  
  
One day maybe I will dance again  
One day maybe I will love again  
One day maybe we will dance again  
You know you've gotta  
Tie yourself to the mast my friend  
And the storm will end  
One day maybe you will love again  
You've gotta tie yourself to the mast my friend  
And the storm will end

You've got to lift yourself up so high  
You can't see the ground  
You don't hear a sound  
You've got to move it up so slow  
You see it all  
You'll probably fall  
  
I'd rather die than see you fly  
Than see you try  
I'd rather die than see you fly  
Than see you try  
  
It's like pushing locked doors to get in your mind  
I don't care what I find  
It's like pushing locked doors to get in your mind  
I don't know what I'll find  
  
You've got to move me up  
So high it hurts  
So high it burns  
But if you let me down  
Don't bother to call  
Just let me fall  
I'd rather die than see you fly  
Than see you try  
I'd rather die than see you fly  
Than see you try  
  
It's like pushing locked doors to get in your mind  
I don't know what I'll find  
It's like pushing locked doors to get in that mind  
I don't care what I find  
It's like pushing locked doors to get in that mind  
I don't care what I find  
It's like pushing locked doors to get in that mind  
I don't care what I find  
It's like pushing locked doors to get in that mind  
I don't care what I find  
It's like pushing locked to get in that mind  
I don't care what I find  
It's like pushing locked doors to get in that mind  
I don't care what I find  
  
It's only one...  
  
One way to go  
One way to go  
  
One way to go  
One way to go

How hard is it for me to wait for you  
See you in the next one have a good time  
Could be a lifetime before I see you again  
See you in the next one have a good time  
  
Eyes they open wide  
Eyes they open wide  
I like the way  
It was hate the way it is now  
  
Lack of time and a wasted week end  
You wore your lies like a filmstar  
  
Eyes they open wide  
Eyes they open wide  
I like the way it was  
Hate the way it is now

Here she comes  
Seven suns  
A burning flame  
She got my love  
Got my head  
But it's all the same  
She climbed so high  
I don't know why  
High  
On her own  
  
And I know  
She's in the air  
And I don't want it to go  
I can feel her love  
But I don't want it to go  
  
She got my woe  
Got my hand  
Took the dreams  
Right outta my head  
She bought the world  
I paid the bills  
I took those pills  
It was wind in her sails  
She climbed so high  
I don't know why  
High,  
On her own  
  
And I know  
She's in the air  
And I don't want it to go  
I can feel her love  
But I don't want it to go

I sit and wonder, I often wonder  
I sit and wonder about the things she does  
I sit and wonder, I often wonder  
I've been waiting for this moment to come  
  
And she's the teacher and I'm the pupil but I ain't learning anything at all  
Now I' m falling into the black hole and I can barely feel the sun  
  
Yeah I sit and wonder, I fall to pieces  
I've been waiting for her to come  
A bed of roses, her cheeks like peaches  
Yeah I ain't going to wait no more  
  
Give me some light, give the light, yeah give me some light, give me some
light  
  
Well writes a passage, we are mistaken, yeah  
Some are going to break into stone,  
The door is open and I am reaching, yeah  
It looks like a prodigal son  
  
Yeah give me some light, give the light, yeah give me some light, give me some
light  
  
God give me the light, give me the light, yeah give me some light, give me
some light  
  
I've been there doing it to my mind Lord  
  
Something is going on inside my head Lord  
Something is going on inside my head Lord

So take your time  
I wonder if you're here just to use my mind  
Don't take it slow  
You know I've got a place to go  
You always do that  
Something I'm not sure of  
But just for today  
Let go and slide away  
  
I was thinking maybe we could go outside  
Let the night sky cool your foolish pride  
Don't you feel alive  
These are your times and our highs  
  
So take your time  
I wonder which cup you'll drink from  
I hope it's mine  
Beause you always do that something  
Something I'm not sure of  
But just for today  
Let go and burn away  
'Cause I read your mind  
I need it because it takes me where I can't find  
Because you always do that something  
Something I'm not sure of  
But just for today  
Let go and burn away  
  
Repeat  
  
Slide away burn away  
Slide away burn away  
I read your mind  
I read your mind  
'Cause it takes me to where I can't find...

Life  
Roll my die  
Change this life  
You said this movie was mine  
But now you go and change your mind  
This is my life  
So it goes  
You come in on your own in this life  
You know you leave on your own  
'Cause I don't need no cause  
When my feelings fall  
You showed me things I didn't want to see  
I don't believe that love is free  
Sure fine way to treat a man  
  
So it goes  
You come in on your own in this life  
And you know you leave on your own  
  
Life  
This is my Life  
So it goes  
You come into this life on your own  
You know you'll leave on your own  
Life  
This is my life  
So it goes  
You come into this life on your own  
You know you leave  
I'm just a poor little wifeless fella  
I'm just a poor little wifeless fella  
I'm just a poor little wifeless fella  
I'm just a poor little wifeless fella  
Another drink and I won't miss her  
Another drink and I won't miss her  
Another drink and I won't miss her  
Another drink and I won't miss her

My friend and me  
Looking through her red box of memories  
Faded I'm sure  
But love seems to stick in her veins you know  
  
Yes, there's love if you want it  
Don't sound like no sonnet, my lord  
Yes, there's love if you want it  
Don't sound like no sonnet, my lord  
My lord  
  
Why can't you see  
That nature has its way of warning me  
Eyes open wide  
Looking at the heavens with a tear in my eye  
  
Yes, there's love if you want it  
Don't sound like no sonnet, my lord  
Yes, there's love if you want it  
Don't sound like no sonnet, my lord  
My lord  
  
Sinking faster than a boat without a hull  
My lord  
Dreaming about the day when I can see you there  
My side  
By my side  
  
Here we go again and my head is gone, my lord  
I stop to say hello  
'Cause I think you should know, by now  
By now  
By now  
By now  
By now  
By now  
Oh, by now  
Oh, by now  
Oh, by now  
Oh, by now

There ain't no space and time  
To keep our love alive  
We have existence and it's all we share  
There ain't no real truth  
There ain't no real lies  
Keep on pushin' 'cause I know it's there  
  
Oh, can you just tell me  
It's all right (It's all right)  
Let me sleep tonight  
Oh, can you comfort me  
Tonight (It's all right)  
Make it all seem fine  
  
I just can't make it alone  
Oh, no, no  
I just can't make it alone  
Oh, no, no  
  
There'll be no lullabies  
There'll be no tears cried  
We feel numb 'cause we don't see  
That if we really care  
And we really loved  
Think of all the joy we'd feel  
  
Oh, can you just tell me  
It's all right (It's all right)  
Let me sleep tonight  
Oh, can you comfort me  
Tonight (It's all right)  
Make it all seem fine  
  
I just can't make it alone  
Oh, no, no  
I just can't make it alone  
Oh, no, no  
I just can't make it alone  
Oh, no, no  
I just can't make it alone  
Oh, no, no  
  
Ain't got no lullaby, no, no  
Ain't got no lullaby, oh, no  
There is no space and time  
Oh lord  
There is no space and time  
Oh lord  
  
We have existence and it's all we share  
We have existence and it's all we share  
We have existence and it's all we share  
We have existence and it's all we share  
We have existence and it's all we share  
Keep on pushing 'cause I know it's there  
Keep on pushing 'cause I know it's there  
Keep on pushing 'cause I know it's there  
Keep on pushing 'cause I know it's there

Hello it's me, it's me  
Calling out I can see you  
Hello it's me, crying out, crying out  
Are you there?  
  
Hello it's me, it's me  
I want to touch you  
It's me throwing stones from the stars  
On your mixed up world  
  
Been circling round for twenty years  
And in that time I've seen all the fires and all the liars  
I've been calling home for twenty years  
And in that time I heard the screams rebound to me  
While, you were making history  
  
I could see the fire  
And I'll throw the fire back down

I wanted to tell you my story  
How my life seemed to change in a matter of days  
The heavens break I am walking tall  
How come change always seems to bring the rain  
  
Stormy clouds, new horizons  
Come and get it, if you want to  
So hop on the train 'Cause it kills the pain  
Blues player going to another town  
Believe me this boy here is sinking  
Just drinking  
  
These streets, these times  
They tie me down through with you  
But I feel no pain  
Stormy clouds, new horizons

I got one more life  
Can you see it wasting away?  
But I got a plan  
Do you understand?  
  
The drugstore wife  
I was dealing soul and other white  
I won't shake your hands  
'Cause death has no plans  
  
But here we are the rolling people  
Can't stay for long  
We gotta go  
  
So come alive with the rolling poeple  
Don't ask why  
We just know  
  
I'm on a big jet plane  
With my briefcase and crime in my veins  
I'll be the first to toast  
To my rowdy soul  
  
But here we are the rolling people  
Don't ask why  
We don't know  
  
So come alive with the rolling people  
Don't ask why  
We just go now  
Yeah  
  
Don't even know which way I'm going to  
The lights are on and I am feeling blue  
I hope you know which way I'm going to fly  
Thank you for my life  
I said good night, good-bye  
  
You see me going  
  
But here we are the rolling people  
Can't stay for long  
We gotta go  
  
So come alive with the rolling people  
Don't ask why  
We don't know now  
Yeah

I'm the only man who ever really thought that I had qualified  
From the corners of your mind you would care for another guy,  
  
Now I'm lookin at you straight in the eye,  
I know it feels good and I know you should try me  
  
But every chance you get you just hesitate,  
Is there something in my look that you really hate,  
  
Open me up I feel real glad,  
You can take all I have,  
Maybe maybe dont you think its time  
  
This could be my moment, somethin' more than weather  
Don't you wanna try it (maybe, maybe)  
This could be my moment, somethin more than weather  
Don't you wanna try it  
  
I'll open up my mind I swear I'd let you in  
There's nothin that you couldent beg steal or have  
I'm lookin at you straight in the eye  
I know it feels good and I know ya'll high  
Maybe, maybe dont you think its time  
  
This could be my moment, somethin' more than weather  
Don't you wanna try it (maybe, maybe)  
This could be my moment somethin more than weather  
Don't you wanna try it  
  
There's only one  
There's only one  
There's one life one chance, come on lets hit the floor  
  
This could be my moment (come on now!), somethin more than weather  
Don't you wanna try it  
Somethin' more than everyday, a chance to walk and break away  
Don't you wanna try it  
  
Come on and wipe those tears away from your eyes  
This could be my last chance  
There'll be no better night (gotta go sacrafice)  
This could be my my last chance  
This could be my my last chance  
There'll be no better time, yeah!  
There'll be no better day, yeah!

I stand accused just like you  
For being born without a silver spoon  
Stood at the top of a hill  
Over my town I was found  
I've been on the shelf too long  
Sitting at home in my bed too long  
Got my things and now I'm gone  
How's the world gonna from take me?  
Finding myself used to be hard  
But now I see the light  
If love is a drug  
Then I don't need it  
I've been on the shelf too long  
Sitting at home in my bed too long  
Now it's time to hear my song  
How are you gonna take it?  
I've been on the shelf too long  
Think the words without the song  
Never had a way to go  
Tell me now I'm taking it  
I've been on the shelf too long  
I've been on the shelf too long  
I've been on the shelf too long  
We've got a lot of living to do  
There's a door in my mind that's open wide  
Come inside come inside  
Jesus never saved me  
He'll never save you too, and you know!  
I've got a little sticker on the back of my boot  
This is music  
And now I see the light shining bright in my eyes  
If love is the drug then it ain't for me  
Well music is my life  
And loved by me  
I'm gonna move on the floor with my sweet young thing  
Down down down we go till we reach the bottom  
Of our soul with this is music

Lookin' back on my life  
You know that all I see  
Are things I could've changed  
I should have done  
Where did the good times go?  
Good times so hard to hold  
This time this time  
This time I'm gonna find  
Lookin' back on my life  
You know that all I see  
Are things I could've changed  
I could have done  
No time for sad lament  
A wasted life is bitter spent  
  
So rise into the light  
In or out of time  
Gonna rise straight through the light  
In or out of time  
  
Woke up one other day  
The pain won't go away  
I am growing  
In peculiar ways  
Into a light I pass  
Another dream, another trance  
This time, this time  
This time I'm gonna rise into the light  
In or out of time  
  
Gonna find my way in life  
In or out of sight  
I'm still seeing things in black and white  
Gonna rise straight into the light  
In or out of sight  
  
I'm gonna see the light  
I'm gonna see the light  
I'm gonna see the light  
  
'Cause I know there is time  
There is time  
There is time  
There is time  
There is time  
There is time  
There is time  
There is time  
This time, this time  
This time, this time  
This time, this time  
This time, this time

Can you keep yourself on for good  
Seems like the whole world is losing  
How do you stop yourself up  
Even if seems like the whole world is crying  
  
Aaaah oooh  
Aaaah oooh  
She got all I need  
The air I breath  
When it comes to my valium skies  
She don't mind if I cry  
  
How do you stop your love from crying  
Even if you knew she was lying  
How do you stop this world from loathing  
Still no knocking with all these cards I'm holding  
  
Aaaah oooh  
Aaaah oooh  
She got all I need  
The air I breath  
When it comes to my valium skies  
She don't mind if I cry  
  
She don't mind if I cry  
She don't mind if I cry  
  
Aaaah oooh  
Aaaah oooh  
She got all I need  
The air I breath  
When it comes to my valium skies  
She don't mind if I cry  
  
When it comes to my valium skies  
She don't mind if I cry

When morning breaks  
We hide our eyes and our love's aching  
Nothing's strange  
  
It was in our hands from 6 to 10  
It slipped right out again  
  
There'll be no better time  
There'll be no better way  
There'll be no better day to save me  
Save me  
Yeah, save me  
  
I hope you see like I see  
I hope you see what I see  
I hope you feel like I feel  
  
And the world don't stop  
There is no time for cracking up  
Believe me friend  
'Cause when freedom comes  
I'll be long gone  
You know it has to end  
  
There'll be no better time  
There'll be no better way  
There'll be no better day to save me  
Save me  
Yeah, save me  
Yeah, save me  
I hope you see what I see  
I hope you feel like I feel  
Someone to stand beside me  
Beside me  
Beside me  
Beside me  
Beside me  
  
Weeping willow  
The pills under my pillow  
Weeping willow  
Pills under my pillow  
Weeping willow  
The Gun under your pillow  
Weeping willow  
Beside me  
Beside me  
Beside me  
Beside me

You get the burn  
We're on the train  
I feel no pain  
I feel no pain  
  
You set the sights  
But I'm already there  
Do you care?  
Do you care?  
  
I can't get it out of my head  
When you said  
I'm gonna leave  
  
I felt surprised  
That you wanted to know  
Where the geese go to  
Late at night  
I'm feeling fine  
What is it inside  
It's inside  
  
And I can't get it out of my head  
When he said  
I'm leaving
