Bless the Lord oh my soul  
Oh my soul  
Worship His Holy name  
Sing like never before  
Oh my soul  
I'll worship Your Holy name  
  
The sun comes up  
It's a new day dawning  
It's time to sing Your song again  
Whatever may pass  
And whatever lies before me  
Let me be singing  
When the evening comes  
  
Bless the Lord oh my soul  
Oh my soul  
Worship His Holy name  
Sing like never before  
Oh my soul

You're rich in love  
And You're slow to anger  
Your name is great  
And Your heart is kind  
For all Your goodness  
I will keep on singing  
Ten thousand reasons  
For my heart to find  
  
Bless the Lord oh my soul  
Oh my soul  
Worship His Holy name  
Sing like never before  
Oh my soul  
I'll worship Your Holy name  
Bless You Lord  
  
And on that day  
When my strength is failing  
The end draws near  
And my time has come  
Still my soul will  
Sing Your praise unending  
Ten thousand years  
And then forevermore  
Forevermore  
  
Bless the Lord oh my soul  
Oh my soul  
Worship His Holy name  
Sing like never before  
Oh my soul  
I'll worship Your Holy name

Sing like never before  
Oh my soul  
I'll worship Your Holy name  
Jesus I will worship Your Holy name  
Worship Your Holy name

Who could imagine a melody  
True enough to tell of Your mercy?  
Who could imagine a harmony  
Sweet enough to tell of Your love?  
I see the heavens proclaiming You day after day,  
And I know in my heart that there must be a way  
  
To sing a greater song,  
A greater song to You on the earth.  
To sing a greater song,  
A greater song to You on the earth.  
  
Who could imagine a symphony,  
Grand enough to tell of Your glory?  
Our highest praise but a feeble breath  
A whisper of Your thunderous worth.  
  
I see the heavens proclaiming You day after day,  
And I know in my heart that there must be a way  
  
To sing a greater song,  
A greater song to You on the earth.  
To sing a greater song,  
A greater song to You on the earth.  
  
Hallelujah, we want to lift You higher,  
Hallelujah, we want to lift You higher.

A love so undeserved, a gift that's free  
You lavish me  
A peace I could not earn  
And mercy for the freedom of my soul  
  
That's what's so amazing about Your grace  
That's what's so amazing about Your grace  
  
Forgiveness runs so deep  
Within Your heart of loving kindness  
And should a soul forget  
The cross of Christ reminds us every day  
  
That's what's so amazing about Your grace  
That's what's so amazing about Your grace  
Lord, every day pour on me  
Your blessings of eternity  
And that's what's so amazing about Your grace  
  
Freely I've recieved, now freely to give  
Freely I've recieved, now freely to give  
Freely I've recieved, now freely to give  
Give my life to You...

All my days, I will sing this song of gladness  
Give my praise to the fountain of delights  
For in my helplessness, You heard my cry  
And waves of mercy poured down on my life  
  
Beautiful Savior, wonderful counselor  
Clothed in majesty, Lord of history  
You're the way, the truth, the life  
  
Star of the morning, glorious in holiness  
You're the risen one, heaven's champion  
And You reign, You reign over all  
  
I will trust in the cross of my Redeemer  
I will sing of the love that never fails  
Of sins forgiven, of conscience cleansed  
Of death defeated and life without end  
  
Beautiful Savior, wonderful counselor  
Clothed in majesty, Lord of history  
You're the way, the truth, the life  
  
Star of the morning, glorious in holiness  
You're the risen one, heaven's champion  
And You reign, You reign over all, over all  
  
Wonderful counselor  
Beautiful risen one, yeah  
  
Beautiful Savior, wonderful counselor  
Clothed in majesty, Lord of history  
You're the way, the truth, the life  
  
Star of the morning, glorious in holiness  
You're the risen one, heaven's champion  
And You reign, You reign over all  
Yes You reign over all  
  
I long to be where the praise is never ending  
Yearn to dwell over glory never fades  
Where countless worshipers will sing one song  
And cries of worthy will honour the Lamb.  
  
Worthy, worthy, worthy  
Worthy, worthy, worthy  
Worthy, worthy, worthy  
...

Befriended, befriended by the King above all Kings  
Surrendered, surrendered to a friend above all friends  
Invited, invited deep into this mystery  
Delighted, delighted by the wonders I have seen  
This will be my story  
This will be my song  
You'll always be my savior.  
Jesus You will always have my heart  
Astounded, astounded that Your gospel beckoned me  
Surrounded, surrounded but I've never been so free,  
Determined, determined now to live this life for You  
You're so worthy my greatest gift would be the least You're due  
This will be my story  
This will be my song  
You'll always be my Savior.  
Jesus You will always have my heart

Blessed Be Your Name  
In the land that is plentiful  
Where Your streams of abundance flow  
Blessed be Your name  
  
Blessed Be Your name  
When I'm found in the desert place  
Though I walk through the wilderness  
Blessed Be Your name  
  
Every blessing You pour out  
I'll turn back to praise

On the road marked with suffering  
Though there's pain in the offering  
Blessed be Your name  
  
Every blessing You pour out  
I'll turn back to praise  
When the darkness closes in, Lord  
Still I will say  
  
Blessed be the name of the Lord  
Blessed be Your name  
Blessed be the name of the Lord  
Blessed be Your glorious name  
  
Blessed be the name of the Lord  
Blessed be Your name

My heart will choose to say  
Lord, blessed be Your name

We have nothing to give  
That didn't first come from Your hands  
We have nothing to offer You  
Which You did not provide  
Every good, perfect gift comes from  
Your kind and gracious heart  
And all we do is give back to You  
What always has been Yours  
Lord, we're breathing the breath  
That You gave us to breathe  
To worship You, to worship You  
And we're singing these songs  
With the very same breath  
To worship You, to worship You  
Who has given to You  
That it should be paid back to him?  
Who has given to You  
As if You needed anything?  
From You, and to You, and through You  
Come all things, O Lord  
And all we do is give back to You  
What always has been Yours  
We are breathing the breath  
That You gave us to breathe

Come, come let us return to the Lord  
Come, come let us return to the Lord  
In brokenness of heart, we consecrate our lives singing  
Come, come let us return to the Lord  
  
With a rending of the heart  
With the bowing of a knee  
Oh we are returning  
With a prayer and with a fast  
With a song in minor key  
Lord we are repenting  
  
Even now, even now  
With all of our hearts  
You may turn, You may leave a blessing behind  
  
In Your mercy You will come  
In Your mercy You will come  
Surely as the rising sun  
Surely as the rising sun

Could this be the land of the free?  
Could this be the land of the free?  
Let salvation's waves crash on these shores again  
And the tide of Your great love come rushing in.  
Could this be the land of the free?  
  
Did you feel the mountains tremble,  
Did you hear the oceans roar,  
When the people rose to sing of  
Jesus Christ, the risen one?  
  
Did you feel the people tremble,  
Did you hear the singers roar,  
When the lost began to sing of  
Jesus Christ, the saving one?  
  
And we can see that, God, You're moving.  
A mighty river through the nations  
When young and old return to Jesus.  
Fling wide, you heavenly gates  
Prepare the way of the risen Lord.  
  
Open up the doors and let the music play,  
Let the streets resound with singing.  
Songs that bring Your hope, and  
Songs that bring Your joy.  
Dancers who dance upon injustice.  
  
Did you feel the darkness tremble,  
When all the saints join in one song,  
And all the streams flow as one river,  
To wash away our brokenness?  
  
And here we that, God, You're moving,  
A time of jubilee is coming,  
When young and old return to Jesus.  
Fling wide, you heavenly gates,  
Prepare the way of the risen Lord.  
  
Open up the doors and let the music play,  
Let the streets resound with singing.  
Songs that bring Your hope, and  
Songs that bring Your joy.  
Dancers who dance upon injustice.

Father let me dedicate all this life to Thee  
In whatever worldly state Thou would have me be  
Not from sorrow, pain or care, freedom dare I claim  
This alone shall be my prayer, glorify Thy name  
  
Can a child presume to choose where or how to live?  
Can a Father's love refuse all the best to give?  
Let my glad heart, while it sings, There in all proclaim  
And, whatever the future brings, glorify Thy Name  
  
Be glorified in me, be glorified  
Be glorified in me, be glorified

I will love you for the cross  
And I will love you for the cost  
Man of sufferings  
Bringer of my peace  
You came into a world of shame  
And paid the price we could not pay  
Death that brought me life  
Blood that brought me home  
Death that brought me life  
Blood that brought me home  
Chorus:  
And I love you for the cross  
I'm overwhelmed by the mystery  
I love you for the cost  
That Jesus you would do this for me  
When you were broken, you were beaten,  
You were punished, I go free  
You were wounded and rejected  
In your mercy - I am healed  
Jesus Christ the sinners friend  
Does this kindness know no bounds  
With your precious blood you have purchased me  
Oh the mystery of the cross  
You were punished you were crushed  
But that punishment has become my peace  
Yes that punishment has become my peace  
Chorus  
By your wounds I am healed  
For the cross, for the cross, for the cross I thank you  
Oh Lord, for the cross, for the cross  
Chorus

We will dance, we will dance for Your glory  
We will dance, we will dance for Your glory  
We will dance for Your glory, Lord  
We will lift up a shout to adore You  
Every sound that we make, it is for You  
We will dance for Your glory, Lord  
  
For salvation's in this place  
You're the name by which we're saved, Jesus, Jesus  
Let Your name be lifted high  
As our thankful hearts now cry, "Jesus, Jesus"  
  
Lift up your heads, you ancient gates  
Be lifted up, you ancient doors  
The King is coming in, the King is coming in  
We lift up a shout to shake the skies  
Lift up a cry, "Be glorified!"  
The King is coming in, the King is coming in  
  
We're the people of God with a song to sing  
And we're bringing our lives as an offering  
We will dance for Your glory, Lord  
And Your cross is the hope that we hold up high  
As we tell the whole world of Your love and life  
We will dance for Your glory, Lord

With the choir of angels singing,  
And the realm of heavenly hosts  
As those elders humbly bow,  
I'd love to come to Your throne with a simple song  
  
With the little creatures speaking,  
Praise and praise and praise again  
With the company of heaven,  
I'd love to come to Your throne with a song of love  
  
Hallelujah, Jesus, hallelujah, hallelu  
Hallelujah, Jesus, pouring out my heart to You  
  
I would bring this praise like insense  
Rising to Your throne above  
Fill the air with heart-filled songs  
Harmony and melody for the One I Love  
  
Who can tell the adoration  
That will rise up to Your throne  
Every knee that day shall bow  
To the King of kings, the Holy One, the only One  
We'll all be singing...

Here is love, vast as the ocean  
Loving kindness as the flood  
When the Prince of Life, our Ransom  
Shed for us His precious blood  
Who His love will not remember?  
Who can cease to sing His praise?  
He can never be forgotten  
Throughout Heaven's eternal days  
  
On the mount of crucifixion  
Fountains opened deep and wide  
Through the floodgates of God's mercy  
Flowed a vast and gracious tide  
Grace and love, like mighty rivers  
Poured incessant from above  
And Heaven's peace and perfect justice  
Kissed a guilty world in love  
  
No love is higher, no love is wider  
No love is deeper, no love is truer  
No lover is higher, no lover is wider  
No love is like Your love, o Lord

As we come today  
We remind ourselves of what we do  
That these songs are not just songs  
But signs of love for you  
This is a holy moment now  
Something of heaven touches earth  
Voices of angels all resound  
We join their song  
Come come come  
Let us worship God  
With our hands held high  
And our hearts bowed down  
We will run run run  
Through your gates o God  
With a shout of love with a shout of love  
Lord with confidence  
We come before your throne of grace  
Not that we deserve to come  
But you have paid the way  
You are the holy king of all  
Heaven and earth are in your hands  
All of the angels sing your song  
We join them now  
Chorus

Now unto the King who reigns over all  
And never changes or turns  
Unfailing justice, unfading grace  
Whose promises remain  
Yes, Your promises remain  
  
The heavens ring  
The saints all sing  
"Great is Your faithfulness"  
From age to age  
We will proclaim  
"Great is Your faithfulness  
How great is Your faithfulness"  
  
Everything changes, but You stay the same  
Your word and kingdom endure  
We lean on the promise of all that You are  
And trust forevermore  
We will trust forevermore  
  
From generation to generation  
You never fail us, O God  
Yesterday and today and tomorrow  
Until the day You return

God of restoration  
My hope is in the life You bring to me  
Healer of my wounds  
I thank You, O I thank You  
  
God of my salvation  
With saving love You came to rescue me  
Healer of my soul  
I thank You, O I thank You  
Today and every day...  
  
I am Yours, I am Yours  
Every breath that I breathe  
Every moment that's lived  
I am Yours, I am Yours  
You're the reason to breathe  
You're the reason to live  
And now everyone that You have saved  
Will come to be Your praise  
  
I am Yours  
  
Singing of a love now  
You taught this broken heart to sing again  
Everyday I'll sing, to thank You,  
O to thank You  
Singing of a life now  
You taught this wounded soul to live again.  
Everyday I'll live, to thank You,  
O to thank You  
And today and everyday...  
  
And if my food is to do Your will  
Then I'm hungry, still hungry  
There's so much more  
That I need to give  
To thank You, to thank You  
Today and every day

I lift you high and bow down low  
How high can You be?  
How low can I go?  
I lift You high and bow down low  
How high can You be?  
How low can I go?  
You must increase I must decrease, Lord  
I'll bow down and You will be adored  
  
I lift you high and bow down low  
How high can You be?  
How low can I go?  
I lift You high and bow down low  
How high can You be?  
How low can I go?  
You must increase I must decrease, Lord  
I'll bow down and You will be adored

Jesus, I could sing  
In the tongues of men and angels  
But if I have not love  
I am just a clanging cymbal, and empty sound  
2x  
Chorus:  
This is a love song  
This is a love song  
Jesus, a love song to You  
A song of devotion, a reverent passion  
Savior, a love song to You  
Jesus, I could pray  
With a faith that moves a mountain  
But if I have not love  
It is just a noise resounding, an empty sound  
2x  
Chorus 2x  
This is a love song to You  
Hear our devotion  
Chorus  
It's the overflow of hearts  
As we gaze upon Your beauty  
A reflection of Your worth  
For we've seen a glimpse of You in Your glory, Lord

You've put a new song in my mouth  
It is a hymn of praise to You  
Justice and mercy are it's theme  
And I will live it back to You  
  
The kind of fast You've chosen, Lord It must reach out  
To broken lives and to the poor So change me, Lord  
  
I know You are the orphan's hope  
I know You are the widow's song  
O Lord, You're showing me what's on You're heart  
  
Lord, I wont bring an empty song It's meaningless  
Without compassion in my life And holiness  
  
You're Father were no father lives  
And to the lonely You're a friend  
O Lord, You're showing me what's on You're heart  
  
I know You are the orphan's hope  
I know You are the widow's song  
You're Father were no father lives  
And to the lonely You're a friend  
O Lord, You're showing me what's on You're heart

We could try to count the stars  
You already know them each by name  
Every single galaxy was Your design

'Till Your Kingdom comes on earth  
We've positioned watchmen on the walls  
Now our prayers will flow like tears  
For You've shared Your heart with us  
God of Heaven, on our knees we fall  
  
Come down in power, reveal Your heart again  
Come hear our cries, the tears that plead for rain

Lay me down, oh oh oh  
Lay me down  
Lay me down, oh oh oh  
Lay me down  
Lay me down

Lead us up the mountain  
Lead us to the place Your glory dwells God  
Lead us up the mountain  
Lead us to the place Your glory dwells God  
Lead us up the mountain  
Lead us to the place Your glory dwells God  
Lead us up the mountain  
Lead us to the place Your glory dwells God  
Lead us up the mountain

Make my life a prayer to You  
I want to do what You want me to  
No empty words, no white lies  
No token prayers, no compromise  
  
I want to shine the light You gave  
Through Your Son You sent to save us  
From ourselves and our despair  
It comforts me to konw You're really there  
  
Well, I want to thank You now for being patient with me  
Oh, it's so hard to see when my eyes are on me  
I guess I'll have to trust and just believe what You say  
Oh, You're coming again, coming to take me away  
  
I want to die and let You give Your life to me that I might live  
And share the hope You gave the me  
The love that set me free  
I want to tell the world out there  
You're not something or fairy tale  
That I've made up inside my head  
You're God the Son, You've risen from the dead  
  
I want to die and let You give Your life to me that I might live  
And share the hope You gave to me  
I want to share the love that set me free

Verse 1  
Let worship be the fuel for mission's flame  
We're going with a passion for Your name  
We're going for we care about Your praise  
Send us out  
Verse 2  
Let worship be the heart of mission's aim  
To see the nations recognize Your fame  
'Til every tribe and tongue voices Your praise  
Send us out  
Chorus  
You should be the praise of every tongue, Jesus  
You should be the joy of every heart  
But until the fullness of Your kingdom comes  
Until the final revelation dawns  
Send us out  
Bridge  
Every tribe, every tongue  
Every creature in the heavens and the earth  
Every heart, every soul  
Will sing Your praise, will sing Your praise  
Every note, every strain  
Every melody will be for You alone  
Every harmony that flows from every tongue  
We'll sing Your praise, we'll sing Your praise  
We'll sing Your praise, we'll sing Your praise  

More than oxygen, I need your love  
More than life-giving food the hungry dream of  
More than an eloquent word depends on the tongue  
More than a passionate song needs to be sung  
  
More than a word could ever say  
More than a song could ever convey  
I need you more than all of these things  
Father, I need you more  
  
More than magnet and steel are drawn to unite  
More than poets love words to rhyme as they write  
More than comforting warmth of sun in spring  
More than the eagle loves wind under it's wings  
  
More than a word could ever say  
More than a song could ever convey  
I love you more than all of these things  
Father, I love you more  
  
More than a blazing fire on a winter's night  
More than the tall evergreens reach for the light  
More than the pounding waves long for the shore  
More than these gifts You give, I love You more

My hope is built  
On nothing less  
Then Jesus' blood and righteousness  
I dare not trust  
The sweetest frame  
But wholly lean  
On Jesus' Name  
  
When the mountains are falling  
When the waters are rising  
I shall be safe in You  
Though the nations are quaking  
Every kingdom be shaken  
Still will rest in You  
  
When darkness seems  
To hide Your face  
I rest on Your  
Unchanging grace  
In every high  
And stormy gale  
My anchor holds  
Within the veil

Standing on this mountaintop  
Looking just how far we've come  
Knowing that for every step  
You were with us  
  
Kneeling on this battle ground  
Seeing just how much You've done  
Knowing every victory  
Was Your power in us  
  
Scars and struggles on the way  
But with joy our hearts can say  
Yes, our hearts can say  
  
Never once did we ever walk alone  
Never once did You leave us on our own  
You are faithful, God, You are faithful

Held within Your perfect peace  
Never once, no, we never walk alone  
  
Never once did we ever walk alone  
Never once did You leave us on our own  
You are faithful, God, You are faithful  
  
Every step we are breathing in Your grace  
Evermore we'll be breathing out Your praise  
You are faithful, God, You are faithful  
You are faithful, God, You are faithful  
You are faithful, God, You are faithful  
Your are, You are faithful, God, You are faithful

Your blood speaks a better word  
Than all the empty claims I've heard upon this earth  
Speaks righteousness for me  
And stands in my defense  
Jesus it's Your blood  
  
What can wash away our sins?  
What can make us whole again?  
Nothing but the blood  
Nothing but the blood of Jesus  
What can wash us pure as snow?  
Welcomed as the friends of God  
Nothing but Your blood  
Nothing but Your blood King Jesus  
  
Your cross testifies in grace  
Tells of the Father's heart to make a way for us  
Now boldly we approach  
Not by earthly confidence  
It's only Your blood

O Sacred King, O Holy King  
How can I honour You rightly,  
Honour that's fit for Your name?  
O Sacred friend, O Holy friend  
I don't take what You give lightly  
Friendship instead of disgrace.  
For it's the mystery of the universe  
You're the God of holiness,  
Yet You welcome souls like me  
And with the blessing of Your Father's heart  
You disciple the ones You love  
There's kindness in Your majesty  
Jesus those who recognise Your power  
Know just how wonderful You are  
That You draw near

We give you the glory  
We give you the honor  
We give you the praise!  
  
Christ the Lord

Jesus christ, I think upon your sacrifice  
You became nothing, poured out to death  
Many times I've wondered at your gift of life  
And I'm in that place once again  
I'm in that place once again  
  
And once again I look upon the cross where you died  
I'm humbled by your mercy and I'm broken inside  
Once again I thank you  
Once again I pour out my life  
  
Now you are exalted to the highest place  
King of the heavens, where one day I'll bow  
But for now I marvel at your saving grace  
And I'm full of praise once again  
I'm full of praise once again  
  
Thank you for the cross  
Thank you for the cross  
Thank you for the cross, my friend

O, to see You as You are  
To glimpse the wonderst yet unseen  
Assist my sight, unveil my eyes  
To see You  
Lord, to know You as You are  
To even dare to speak or stand  
Though marked beloved, to fall as dead  
When I see You  
And through grace untold, to see You  
With this heart unveiled, to know You  
Lord, in Your pure light  
How great the glory of Your name  
How small the voice I humbly bring  
Yet with my all I raise a song  
When I see You  
It is the song of love's pure light  
The grace reflected in these eyes  
The overflow of those who know  
They have seen You  
We are disgraced, but You graced us  
With the warmth of Your forgiveness  
Now You lead us ever closer  
To the pure light of Your holiness  
And I'll sing of the wonders of Your grace  
Sing of the wonders of Your grace  
Sing of the wonders of Your grace, O Lord  
And I'll tell of the glory of Your name  
Tell of the glory of Your name  
Tell of the glory of Your name, O Lord

We do not worship an unknown God  
For You've revealed Yourself to us  
And the more we see, the more we love  
This revelation of Your heart  
And we are falling, falling, falling  
We are falling so in love with You  
  
Beyond all question, You're a mystery  
We have known the shallows of the mighty deep  
Unsearchable greatness of a holy God  
Yet day by day You reveal Your heart  
And we are falling, falling, falling  
We are falling so in love with You  
  
Well, how could hearts not love Your Name  
While all creation sings Your praise  
And every breath points back to You, Jesus?  
  
Now in part we see You, then face to face  
And we'll know You fully, as we're fully known  
And the depths of glory You now hide away  
They will be revealed on that glorious day  
And we are falling, falling, falling  
We are falling so in love with You

Salvation spring up from the ground  
Lord rend the heavens and come down  
Seek the lost and heel the lame  
Jesus bring glory to your name  
Let all the prodigals run home  
All of creation waits and groans  
Lord we've heard of your great fame  
Father cause all to shout your name  
X2  
Stir up our hearts oh lord,  
Open our spirits to know who you are  
Put a cry in us so deep inside that we cannot find the words we need  
We just weep and cry out to you  
Chorus again

This is a time for seeing and singing  
This is a time for breathing You in  
And breathing out Yourpraise  
Our hearts repsond to Your revelation

Commands a life of praise  
No one can sing of things they have not seen  
God, open our eyes towards a greater glimpse  
The glory of You, the glory of You  
God, open our eyes towards a greater glimpse  
Worship starts with seeing You  
Worship starts with seeing You  
Our hearts respond to Your revelation

That if we turn and look to Your face  
You will come and heal our land  
You will come

Lord, send revival, start with me  
For I am one of unclean lips  
And my eyes have seen the King  
Your glory I have glimpsed  
Send revival, start with me

My Jesus, my Savior  
Lord, there is none like You  
All of my days  
I want to praise  
The wonders of Your mighty love  
My comfort, my shelter  
Tower of refuge and strength  
Let every breath, all that I am  
Never cease to worship You  
Shout to the Lord, all the earth, let us sing  
Power and majesty, praise to the King  
Mountains bow down and the seas will roar  
At the sound of Your name  
I sing for joy at the works of Your hands  
Forever I'll love You, forever I'll stand  
Nothing compares to the promise I have in You

I am not a stranger to mercy, for You found me  
Wrapped Your truth around me  
I am not a stranger to grace  
I have seen it in Your face  
I am not a stranger to kindness  
We're the broken with Your life inside us  
You have brought Your gospel to me  
And I breathe it every day  
How did I become Your miracle?  
Now to take Your truth and tell the world  
I'm going to take it to the streets  
I'm going to sing it 'til we meet  
Heaven is open  
Come on all the earth rejoice  
I'm going to take it to the streets  
Wake up the dead heart from its sleep  
Heaven is open  
Now's the time to raise our voice  
I will tell the world of this mercy, for You found me  
Wrapped Your truth around me  
I will tell the world of this grace  
I have seen it at Your cross  
I will tell the world of this kindness  
We're the broken with Your life inside us  
You have brought Your gospel to me  
Help me live it every day  
How did we become Your miracles?  
Now to take Your truth and tell the world  

I've thrown it all away that I might gain a life in You  
I've found all else is loss compared to the joys of knowing You  
Your beauty and Your majesty are far beyond compare  
You've won my heart, now this will be my prayer  
[Chorus:]  
Take the world, but give me Jesus  
You're the treasure in this life  
Take the world, but give me Jesus  
Is my cry  
Now I've seen You as the Savior, I will leave the rest behind  
Take the world, but give me Jesus is my cry  
Into the world I go that I might live this life of love  
I won't be overcome, for You are in me and You are strong  
For time and for eternity, I know I'm in Your care  
You've won my heart, now this will be my prayer

Thank you, thank you for the blood that you shed  
standing in its blessing we sing these freedom songs  
thank you thank you for the battle you won  
standing in your victory we sing salvation songs  
we sing salvations song  
  
You have opened a way to the father  
where before we could never have come  
jesus count us as yours now forever

The rock are going to cry out if we don't  
Now's the time to raise a song  
Hear creation shout loud  
We will join our voices to the sound  
  
Stand up, stand up the time has come  
Sing it out, sing an anthem to His name  
A generation worshipping unashamed  
Giving all for the glory of our King  
We will run, we will run after Your heart  
We believe You all that You say You are  
Giving all for the glory of our King  
  
The glory of our King

To be Your Hands and feet upon this earth  
Send us in Your power  
As we take Heaven to a broken world  
  
We are, we are a chosen  
We are, we are called to follow  
We are, we are Your generation  
You are, You are the God who saves us  
You are, You are the God who sends us  
You are, You are the God who's with us

I could sing unending songs of how you saved my soul  
I could dance a thousand miles because of your  
Great love  
My heart is bursting Lord  
To tell of all you've done  
Of how you changed my life and wiped away my past  
I want to shout it out  
From every rooftop sing  
  
For now I know that God is for me not against me  
Everybody's singing now, cause we're so happy  
Everybody's dancing now, cause we're so happy  
If only I could see your face  
See you smiling over us  
And unseen angels celebrate  
The joy is in this place

When the music fades  
All is stripped away,  
And I simply come  
Longing just to bring  
Something that's of worth  
That will bless Your heart  
  
I'll bring You more than a song, for a song in itself  
Is not what You have required  
You search much deeper within through the way things appear  
You're looking into my heart  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm coming back to the heart of worship  
And it's all about You, all about You, Jesus  
I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it  
When it's all about You, all about You, Jesus  
  
King of endless worth  
No one could express how much You deserve  
Though I'm weak and poor  
All I have is Yours, ev'ry single breath  
  
I'll bring You more than a song, for a song in itself  
Is not what You have required  
You search much deeper within through the way things appear  
You're looking into my heart  
  
[Chorus]

Our hearts are breathing in the wonders of Your name  
And we're breathing out Your praise  
The more we see, we sing  
The circle never ends  
For Your glory never fades  
And surely as the rising sun  
Your love O Lord endures, Your love endures forever  
  
From the heights of Your throne  
To the depths of Your heart  
Your majesty surrounds us  
In the power of Your life  
In the grace of Your cross  
Your mercy has found us  
  
Your power we see displayed  
In all that You have made  
In the sky and sea and stars  
And here beneath Your cross  
Your mercy speaks so loud  
Speaking straight into our hearts  
And surely as the rising sun  
Your love O Lord endures, Your love endures forever  
  
And the more we see, we sing  
"Holy is the name of the Lord"  
And the more we see, we sing  
"There is no one like You, God"  
  
Your majesty surrounds us  
Your mercy, Lord, has found us  
There is no one like You, God

Forever in my heart  
And written on my soul  
The promise of Your cross  
I have no other claim  
I have no other plea  
The promise of Your cross  
The hope for every heart  
  
Where mercy ever flows  
And shame's no longer known  
I'll praise You for the cross  
The promise of Your cross to me  
It never fails to bring  
The cleansing that I need  
I'll praise You for the cross  
The promise of Your cross to me  
  
Embedded in my heart  
And rooted in my soul  
The promise of Your cross  
It seals me as Your own  
And tells me I am Yours  
The promise of your cross  
The hope for every heart  
  
Tell it in all the earth  
Sing it throughout the world  
The promise of the cross  
There is a higher way  
There is a higher hope  
The promise of Your cross  
The hope for every heart

When I survey the wondrous cross  
On which the Prince of Glory died  
My richest gain I count but loss  
And pour contempt on all my pride  
  
See from His head, His hands, His feet  
Sorrow and love flow mingled down  
Did ever such love and sorrow meet  
Or thorns compose so rich a crown  
  
Oh the wonderful cross, Oh the wonderful cross  
Bids me come and die and find that I may truly live  
Oh the wonderful cross, Oh the wonderful cross  
All who gather here by grace draw near and bless Your name  
  
Were the whole realm of nature mine  
That were and offering far too small  
Love so amazing, so divine  
Demands my soul, my life, my all

VERSE 1:  
Jesus, this life is for You  
Everything Lord that I do  
Deeds that are pleasing  
And ways that are pure  
Lord make my life bear this fruit  
  
CHORUS:  
This means I love You  
Singing this song  
Lord I don't have the words  
But I do have the will  
This means I love You  
That I take up my cross  
I will sing as I walk out this love  
  
VERSE 2:  
For these are the plans of my heart  
Yet often I'm missing the mark  
See my desire to live in Your truth  
This surely means I love You

I'm trading my sorrows  
I'm trading my shame  
I'm laying them down for the joy of the lord  
  
I'm trading my sickness  
I'm trading my pain  
I'm laying it down for the joy of the lord  
  
We say yes lord yes lord yes yes lord  
Yes lord yes lord yes yes lord  
Yes lord yes lord yes yes lord amen  
  
I'm pressed but not crushed persecuted but not abandoned  
Struck down but not destroyed  
I am blessed beyond the curse for his promise will endure  
That his joy's gonna be my strength  
Though the sorrow may last for the night  
His joy comes with the morning

When my heart runs dry and there's no song to sing  
No holy melody, no words of love within  
I recall the height from which this fragile heart has slipped  
  
And I'll remember You, I will turn back and do  
The things I used to do for the love of You  
Lord, I'll remember You, I will turn back and do  
The things I used to do for the love of You  
  
You are my soul's desire, You are the hope within  
You bring my heart to life, You make my spirit sing  
I recall the height from which this fragile heart has slipped

If it wasn't for your mercy  
If it wasn't for your love  
If it wasn't for your kindness  
How could I stand?  
If it wasn't for your cleansing  
If it wasn't for your blood  
If it wasn't for your goodness  
How could I stand?  
Yet I find myself again  
Where even angels fear to tread  
Where I would never dare to come  
But for the cleansing of your blood  
With you there is forgiveness  
And therefore you are feared  
Jesus it's your loving kindness  
That brings me to my knees  
And I find myself again  
Where even angels fear to tread  
Where I would never dare to come  
But for the cleansing of your blood  
In the beauty of your holiness  
Here in the beauty of your holiness

You spread out the skies  
Over empty space  
Said, "Let there be light"  
To a dark and formless world  
Your light was born  
You spread out Your arms  
Over empty hearts  
Said, "Let there be light  
To a dark and hopeless world  
Your Son was born  
You made the world  
And saw that it was good  
You sent Your only Son  
For You are good  
What a wonderful Maker  
What a wonderful Savior  
How majestic Your whispers  
And how humble Your love  
With a strength like no other  
And the heart of a Father  
How majestiv Your whispers  
What a wonderful God  
No eyes has fully seen  
How beautiful the cross  
And we have only heard that faintest whispers  
Of how great You are

Worthy, You are worthy  
Much more worthy than I know  
I cannot imagine  
Just how glorious You are  
And I cannot begin to tell  
How deep a love You bring  
O Lord my ears have heard of You  
But now my eyes have seen  
  
You're worthy  
You're worthy  
You're worthy  
You're worthy to be praised  
Forever and a day  
  
Glory, I give glory  
To the One who saved my soul  
You found me and You freed me  
From the shame that was my own  
And I cannot begin to tell  
How merciful You've been  
O Lord, my ears had heard of You  
But now my eyes have seen  
  
We'll sing an anthem of the highest praise  
We'll sound an anthem of Your glorious name

Hear Your people saying yes,  
Hear Your people saying yes to You.  
Yes to anything you ask,  
Yes to anything we?re called to do.  
  
Hear your people say amen,  
Hear Your people say amen to You.  
Let Your kingdom come on earth,  
Let it be just like we prayed to You.  
  
Yes and amen to everything that?s in Your heart,  
Yes and amen to everything that You have planned.  
We live to see Your will be done,  
And see Your perfect kingdom come on earth, on the earth.  
  
Yes and amen, we?re taking up our cross for You,  
Give us the strength to take these dreams and follow through.  
We live to see Your will be done,  
And see Your perfect kingdom come on earth, on the earth.  
  
All the promises are yes,  
All the promises are yes in You.  
Every good and perfect gift,  
Every blessing that we have was You.
