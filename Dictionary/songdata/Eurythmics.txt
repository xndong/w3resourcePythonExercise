Three thirty on a sick summer's day  
I round myself staring at a Newcastle bus stop  
A total stranger in a herringbone suit  
Asked me the time through his cigarette lighter  
Fifteen years later on a Wednesday night  
L round myself dreaming in a Manchester night-club  
A total stranger in a luminous tracksuit  
Gives me a kiss and he tastes of aluminium  
Then he's gone  
And in his place a cat with green eyes  
A cat with no tall at all  
Just a very sad expression on his race  
Mandarin quotes on a wrought iron gate  
I'm ringing the doorbell, but the petrol keeps leaking  
A total stranger in a cashmere coat  
Tells me politely, "Your wife is on fire"  
A family outing at the Gosforth Park Hotel  
The girl in the kitchen is working a job scheme  
L told my wife I'm sure I've seen her before  
She told me I kissed her al a Newcastle bus stop  
Then I was gone  
And in my place a cat with green eyes  
A cat with a tale to tell

There used to be a time  
I wore my heart upon my sleeve.  
There used to be a time  
I'd show my gentle side to anyone  
Through these years of wandering  
I know I've been deceived.  
Through these years of wandering  
  
And every time you try to hurt me  
You know you'll only hurt yourself.  
And every time you try to hurt me  
I know you'll be the one to suffer  
When you think you're hurting someone.  
  
A little of you, a little of me,  
A little of you,  
Is hurting someone  
  
Don't tell me I'm the only one  
'Cause I don't need that space.  
Don't ask for love  
I'll throw it back in your face.  
All of these promises  
Were only made to break.  
All of these promises

Adrian, don't you understand?  
Fools like us are always dreaming.  
And when you go to bed  
And cover up your head  
It's better if you try to stop remembering.  
  
And the world is slowly dawning  
To wake up to a new clear morning.  
Some of them just half your age  
Get written off, page by page  
  
Adrian don't you understand?  
Fools like us are always dreaming.  
And when you go to bed  
And cover up your head  
It's better if you try to stop remembering.  
  
Some of them just half your age  
Get written off page by page  
And the world is softly sleeping  
While your fears are in their keeping  
  
All the planet's making haste  
To blow to bits in outer space  
Adrian - don't you understand?

Young girls  
Not so innocent  
Will give you wide eyes  
Will show you knowing smiles  
  
Young men  
An air of independence  
Will take you at their leisure  
They live for pleasure  
  
All the young people of today  
  
Young girls  
An air of mystery  
Are dreaming from their towers  
They smell of flowers  
  
Young men  
They can do anything  
They are set to win  
With unmatched power  
  
All the young people of today

Why do you hurt yourself?  
You do it very well  
You do it so politely  
That you couldn't even tell  
When everything has changed  
You think you're not to blame  
How come you keep on talking  
When the whole thing feels so strange?  
But seeing  
Is not the same as believing  
When everything goes wrong  
You're anything but strong  
It's all bittersweet  
Outside in the street  
The grass is growing greener  
Underneath your feet  
We come and go  
Deep water flows  
Tiny leaves from small seeds  
To tall trees do grow  
But wanting  
Is not the same thing as needing  
There's no need to pretend  
You can't turn back again  
And loving  
Is so different to keeping  
The hurting that we send  
Is so difficult to mend  
Hold on to the good things  
That keep you from falling down  
Hold on to the good things  
That keep you from falling down  
How my heart aches  
More than I can take  
What are we really learning  
When we make the same mistakes?  
Where is your hope?  
It's all gone up in smoke  
You used to be so funny  
Now it's just the same old joke  
And laughing  
Is so very close to crying  
When there's nothing to defend  
It gets you in the end  
And living  
Is so very close to dying  
You struggle on and on  
To find where you belong  
Where do you belong?  

Kat was in the bedroom  
Playing hidehideho  
Lou was in the kitchen  
Kissing Michelangelo  
Ray was in a coffin  
Taking measurements  
With string  
Jean was cleaning  
Windows trying to  
Teach the world to sing  
The satellite was beaming  
In a cabaret show were  
Juliet was arguing with stupid romeo  
The dog was reading poetry by  
Poe and valerie  
And I was sat there thinking  
How happy we could be  
  
Bye bye baby  
Baby bye bye  
I feel so happy but I don't know why  
We're off to see the wizard!  
A.W.O.L.  
Bye bye baby  
I wish you well  
  
Now the sneaky fat magician  
He stole my handkerchief  
He blew his nose and gave  
Himself 20 years of grief  
And I was so dumbfounded  
When he asked me for a loan  
I told him to repeat it  
To my tiny dictaphone  
And all the lazy bastards  
That ever walked the earth  
Were trying to get hold of me  
From Tokyo to Perth  
But I was up the cundy  
Combing my goatee  
You thought I was surrounded  
But with one bound ... our hero was free  
  
Bye bye baby  
Baby bye bye  
I feel so happy but I don't know why  
We're off to see the wizard!  
A.W.O.L.  
Bye bye baby  
I wish you well  
  
Now all you gay lieutenants  
Who follow the yellow brick  
Be sure to take your happy pills  
Before you get seasick  
The journey is long-winded  
With many twists and snakes  
And I forgot to mention  
There were never any breaks

Do you feel sorry lover?  
Do you feel blue?  
What reason did you have  
To be untrue?  
Now you could be so good  
But you have to be so bad  
When you could make me  
Happy lover  
You make me sad.  
  
Now there's a cool breeze blowin'  
Blowin' out the flame  
That used to burn inside me  
At the mention of your name,  
Now there's a cool breeze blowin'  
Blowin' down the track -  
That's where I'm goin'  
And I'm never comin' back...  
  
My my - baby's gonna cry  
My my - baby's gonna cry  
My my - baby's gonna cry  
Tonight - oh yea...  
  
Now there's nothing  
Comes from nothing  
That's what they always say  
Didn't mama tell ya  
That's the price you have to pay?  
Now you can't have  
Your piece of cake  
And eat the sweet thing too  
But that kind of understanding  
Isn't good enough for you  
My my - baby's gonna cry

Take a girl like that  
And put her in a natural setting  
Like a cafe for example.  
Along comes the boy  
And he's looking for trouble  
With a girl like that  
With a girl like that.  
Who knows what they'll decide to do.  
Who knows what they'll get up to.  
I'd love to know.  
Wouldn't you?  
  
I love to listen to beethoven...  
  
You think you know just what you want  
But you have used that weapon agianst me.  
Did I tell you I was lying by the way  
When I said I wanted a new mink coat.  
I was just thinking about  
Something sleek  
To wrap around my tender throat  
I was dreaming like a texan girl  
A girl who thinks she's got the right to everything.  
A girl who thinks she should have  
Something extreme.  
  
I love to listen to beethoven...

Belinda the rain is falling  
Belinda your love is calling  
Belinda he'd never leave you  
Belinda he won't deceive you  
  
Belinda your mind is dreaming  
Belinda it's so misleading  
Belinda he'd never leave you  
Belinda he won't deceive you  
  
How the rain still falls  
  
Belinda your eyes have spoken  
Belinda your heart is broken  
Belinda he'd never leave you  
Belinda he won't deceive you  
  
Dry your tears  
Close your eyes

Cool tears flow upon my pillow.  
And i'm freezing blue with misery.  
You know that i never meant to hurt you  
But something always gets right in the way.  
  
So i'll fill this bedrom full of mystery.  
Hang our last conclusions on the wall.  
And if this empty building starts to get to me  
Please remember that it just might be your fault.  
  
Better to have lost in love  
Than never to have loved at all...  
  
So the fated lovers turn to enemies -  
And all their hidden feelings start to show.  
And i never though that boy  
Could mean so much to me.  
And now it seems i'll have to let you go...

Feel my body breathing in  
Touch the softness of my skin  
I am very beautiful  
I can be so beautiful  
I am very beautiful  
I could be successful  
My hands are moving  
My feet are tied  
Watch the way my hair falls down  
See the way my hair falls down  
I am very beautiful  
I can be so beautiful  
Touch the softness of my skin  
Feel my body breathing in  
My hands are moving  
My feet are tied  
My eyes are closing  
My mouth is wide  
I will let you touch me  
If you want to touch me  

When he found her  
He stayed down there  
With his velvet pills  
And her purple hair  
In a room so dark  
They could barely crawl  
With orange posters  
On Victorian walls  
It was Saturday night  
And he felt like death  
She just wanted to be loved  
Like anybody else  
Saturday night  
And the clock never stopped  
She felt like a loser  
On top or the pops  
The Chelsea lovers  
With guillotine lips  
Mascara egos  
Doing a magazine strip  
Chelsea lovers  
In a vicious town  
With lipstick futures  
Like a couple of clowns  
Strange creatures  
In the eider down  
Teenage oblivion  
Waiting to be crowned  
Holes in the mattress  
Where these beasts have lain  
Awake until morning  
With ice in their veins  
Facing each other  
Their eyes never met  
He just wanted to be straight  
It never happened to him yet  
Both of them laughing  
But they can't understand  
What it is about friendship  
Makes you hold your own hand  
The Chelsea lovers  
Oh how they can talk  
With their tongues connected  
And their skin like chalk  
Chelsea lovers  
They're joined at the hip  
With the power of madness  
At their fingertips  
Chelsea lovers  
With their limbs entwined  
Making moon sized promises  
From their molecule minds  
Stardust lovers  
In a Ziggy cartoon  
Two solemn lovers  
In a Chelsea room.

Come to me  
Do and be done with me  
(Cold cold cold)  
Don't I exist for you  
Don't I still live for you  
(Cold cold cold)  
Everything I possess  
Given with tenderness  
Wrapped in a ribbon of glass  
Time it may take us but God only knows  
How I've paid for those things in the past  
Dying is easy it's living that scares me to death  
I could be so content hearing the sound of your breath  
Cold is the colour of crystal the snowlight  
That falls from the heavenly skies  
Catch me and let me dive under  
For I want to swim in the pools of your eyes  
I want to be with you baby  
Slip me inside of your heart  
Don't I belong to you baby  
Don't you know that nothing can tear us apart  
Come on now come on now come on now  
Telling you that  
I loved you right from the start...  
But the more I want you the less I get  
Ain't that just the way things are...  
  
Winter has frozen us  
Let love take hold of us  
(Cold cold cold)  
Now we are shivering  
Blue ice is glittering  
(Cold cold cold)  
Cold is the colour of crystal the snowlight  
That falls from the heavenly skies  
Catch me and let me dive under  
For I want to swim in the pools of your eyes

Blue the color suits you cool blue  
How will you stay this way for ever?  
Blue again it's a lasting chill  
To keep you cold as winter  
How can I forget you?  
I'm never gonna give you up, up I said  
How can I forget you baby?  
I'm never gonna give you up, up I said  
Here it comes again  
Here it comes again  
Here it comes again  
Here it comes again  
Blue the color fools you cool blue  
I'll never stay away for ever  
How can I forget you?  
I'm never gonna give you up, up I said  
How can I forget you baby?  
I'm never gonna give you up, up I said  
Here it comes again  
Here it comes again  
Here it comes again  
Here it comes again  
How could she fall for a boy like that  
How could she fall for a boy like that  
How could she fall for a boy like that  
How could she fall for a boy like that  
Blue the color suits you cool blue  
Blue the color fools you blue again  
Blue, cool blue  
How will you stay this way for ever?  
How can I forget you baby?  
I'm never gonna give you up, up I said  
How can I forget you baby?  
I'm never gonna give you up, up I said  
How can I forget you baby?  
I'm never gonna give you up, up I said  
How can I forget you baby?  

Driving me home in your car watching you drive  
Through obstacles and icicles, keeping my mind on it's lead  
Keeping it warm, with chemicals and therapy  
Turn it on take me over crazy sister  
Digging a hole in your heart  
Watching you breathe, punishment and oxygen  
Letting my mind off it's lead  
I watched it disappear, to somewhere dark and reassuring  
Turn it on (can you believe it)  
Take me over (it's psychomazingly true)  
Turn it on crazy sister  
And when I feel it (it's psychomazing it's you)  
Staying at home. Plugging it in  
Kissing the screen, being a god  
Staying at home, screwing it in  
Fucking the screen, being a god  
Turn it on (can you feel it)  
Crazy sister  
Turn it on (can you believe it)  
Crazy sister  
Turn it on, take me over  
Crazy sister  
Crazy sister

My suit is mad. Of human hair  
My shoes are made of skin  
My shirt is made of vaseline  
From my knees up to my chin  
My jewellery is obscene  
But most of all it's fake  
My hat is made of solid gold  
It's the role I rightfully take  
I'm wearing my crown of madness  
Yeah a new creation  
I'm wearing my crown of madness  
Don't ask me to be faithful  
Don't ask me to be good  
Don't ask me to be generous  
I wouldn't if I could  
Don't ask me to be impolite  
You know I always will  
Don't ask me if I'm well  
When you know I'm always ill  
I'm wearing my crown of madness  
Yeah, a new creation  
I'm wearing my crown of madness  
Don't ask me to be serious  
It's serious enough  
Don't try to make me understand  
Reality and stuff  
Don't push me to the limit  
Don't stretch your luck too far  
I know who I am  
Do you know who you are?  
Mad mad mad oooh  
I'm wearing my crown of madness  
Yeah, a new creation  
I'm wearing my crown of madness  
Mad, mad, mad, mad

I saw a hundred men laughing only two understanding  
A wheel that was spinning for good and for evil  
There was a church bell ringing but nobody listening  
Except the beggars in the doorways of designer perfection  
There was a thin man collecting for a government problem  
He spent a long time waiting with that look of disapproval  
There was icicles forming in the agency windows but nothing for sale there  
Only dreamtime oblivion  
Ah - the mysteries that are discussed in the beds of the kings and queens  
Ah - The mysery well it brings you down like a recurring dream  
Ah - here on the diamond avenue (on the diamond avenue)  
And there's a tightrop marriage between the doctor and the junkie  
In daylight it's perfect but at night time it's frightening  
The hospital was moved so the hotel could profit  
But nobody stayed up there to curse it or to mock it  
As hi-fi condition arranged for my transport  
But there's nothing to hear except the sound of bloody progress  
The buildings are blushing from the interest they're earning  
But the tables and the chairs on the bombsites are burning  
Ah - the mysteries that are discussed in the beds of the kings and queens  
Ah - The mysery well it brings you down like a recurring dream  
Ah - here on the diamond avenue (on the diamond avenue)  
Let's have a look, what do you see  
I saw Thatcher and Murdoch those twins of confusing  
Pay Saatchi and Saatchi to keep up their little illusion  
I saw pepsi and my hero both digging a goldmine  
It's funny how money can make you deaf as well as blind  
Ah - the mysteries that are discussed in the beds of the kings and queens  
Ah. The misery well it brings you down in a recurring dream  
Here on the diamond avenue  
Here on the diamond avenue  
Here on the diamond avenue

[Chorus:]  
Yea, oh yea, yea  
Do you want to break-up?  
  
I've got a heavy heart  
Got heart filled full of lead.  
Pocket full of heartache  
(car crash in my head).  
I've got a steady hand  
Gonna lead me to my home.  
Take me up to heaven  
(heaven's where I'm goin')  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I've seen trouble  
I looked right up to it's face  
Never tried to turn away.  
And I've been sad  
I've been overjoyed  
So let me disembrace you now  
My little trouble boy  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You took me to the ocean  
Dropped me like a stone.  
Took me to the deep blue ocean.  
I don't wanna stay there baby  
I don't wanna swim alone  
  
[Chorus]

Miracle of miracles  
Look what the night dragged in  
It's a pocket full of misery  
And trouble on the wind  
You spoiled the best years  
Of your life  
You took them all in vain  
Now you think that you're forgiven  
But you can't be born again  
  
And you say  
Why?  
You say why?  
You say why?  
Don't ask me why  
  
I don't love you anymore  
I don't think I ever did  
And if you ever had  
Any kind of love for me  
You kept it all so well hid  
  
Promises sweet promises  
You kept them from your mind  
Like all the lost forgotten things  
You never seemed to find  
Like all the disappointments  
You displayed upon your shelf  
Now you've got no one to turn to  
You've got no-one but yourself  
  
And you say  
Why?

Child in the distance  
A memory untamed  
Family connections  
There's a mess in the kitchen  
All messages received  
Always a quick reply  
The mood the afternoon  
Another change of light  
There's nothing like an English  
Summer  
The telephone is good  
So wonderful and true  
We need the time to think  
Everyone's listening  
Another change of light  
The underlying truth  
Request to pack it in  
No solutions  

Everything you are you've been once before  
Everything you hear you've heard it once or more  
Everything you see you've seen it all before  
Everything you dream leads to that open door  
Don't wait so long  
Turn the key before you fade away  
Don't wait so long  
Turn the key before you fade away  
Everyone you love you could have loved them more  
Everyone you touch you could touch to the core  
Every time you wait it's not worth waiting for  
Everyone you lost you better find them all  
Don't wait so long  
Find them all before they fade away  
Don't wait so long  
Find them all before they fade away  
I know you live in isolation  
So you don't have to pretend  
That you could live alone forever  
And be your own best friend  
Here comes the writing on the wall  
And it looks so strange  
Like a primitive sign  
Don't you ever feel that you're so small  
Like a grain of sand in a bottle or wine  
Don't wait so long  
You know I'll always love you  
Don't wait so long  
You know I'll always love you

Life  
It flicked like a dying flame  
Then before my very eyes you came  
And entered our world  
And you were born a king  
It's too late  
Welcome to paradise  
It's too late  
Yes you were born a king  
It's loo late  
Welcome to paradise  
It's too late  
Life  
A million things for you to learn  
But one by one those pages turn  
Like history itself  
But you were born a king  
Your pale blue eyes and velvet skin  
Fingertips and sideways grin  
No photograph or microphone  
Could capture your elusive tone  
No waterfall or running stream  
Could be so pure as your daydream  
No china doll or crystal sphere  
Comes close to you, my child so dear  
In you I have a glimpse of faith  
A love affair with outer space  
A foothold on a mountain top  
A passion there that never stops  
No magazines radio or late night  
Tv monster show  
Could entertain me more than you  
I want you to know  
That you were born a king  
Welcome to paradise  
Yes you were born a king  
Welcome to paradise

Forever  
Now that you're gone  
Gone forever  
But the day goes on forever  
When we were young with time to waste  
Everything was clear and good  
Thought we could live for a thousand years  
But yesterday is done and tomorrow's yet to come  
You'll never know  
Forever  
Now that you're gone  
Gone forever  
But the day goes on forever  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Forever  
And I remember when we were fools  
Everything was me and you  
Thought we were kings with time to kill  
But yesterday is done and tomorrow's yet to come  
You live and learn  
Some people never take the time to try  
The way you live's the way you die  
The stuff of life's in short supply  
And if it sometimes hits you strong  
Remembering that things go wrong  
The song of life is just a song  
And everything goes on and on  
Forever  
Now that you're gone  
Gone forever  
But the day goes on forever  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Forever  

That's what you've got to do, when it's all over  
That's what you've got to do, when it's all over  
That's what you've got to do, when it's all over  
That's what you've got to do, when it's all over  
Greetings from the gutter  
I've been here since yesterday  
Sweet dreams in the gutter  
All the skeletons come out to play  
At times I feel so logical inside  
So just give me the keys  
And I'll drive myself back home  
That's what you've got to do, when it's all over  
That's what you've got to do, when it's all over  
That's what you've got to do, when it's all over  
That's what you've got to do, when it's all over  
I stand in the mirror counting the scars I let you see  
A little soft edged but bitter  
You're a star you don't talk to me  
That's what you've got to do, when it's all over  
That's what you've got to do, when it's all over  
That's what you've got to do, when it's all over  
That's what you've got to do, when it's all over

I put all my eggs in the bacon slicer  
But now it's turned out fine.  
In fact it couldn't be nice  
A nice Jewish girl and a bottle of cider  
Seven days later I was a man of the world  
...... I thought  
I'll go and get a slice of pizza from the pizzeria  
Oh, and a coke  
Has anybody got the change of five quid  
  
I'm happy to be here  
So happy to be here  
And I wish that you were here  
Unhappy with me and happy to be here  
So happy to be here  
But you'd had to have been there to be here  
With me  
  
I played a blinder against a gaggle of nuns  
I was all mouth and trousers they were fingers  
And thumbs had a lesson from the vicar on oral hygiene  
He was stitching my trousers, and staring at  
Christine she had three tickets to see Alfie at the Odeon  
"What's it all about Christine?"  
Free you mind  
Yeah... But what the...  
I'm happy to to be here  
So happy to be here  
And I wish that you were here  
Unhappy with me  
  
I'm happy to be here  
So happy to be here  
But you'd had to have been there to be here  
With me  
  
I'm happy to be here  
So happy to be here  
How I wish that you were here  
Unhappy with me

I bought your record in nyc  
Discorama down on union square  
I must have played it a million times over  
I'd close my eyes imagine you were there  
You know  
I really dig the clothes you wear  
I only wish you could be my baby  
I want to read about it  
Do you think we could have an affair  
  
Maybe your heart is made of stone  
Maybe I'm just too blind to see  
Maybe your heart is made of stone  
Maybe I'm just too blind to see  
  
Two weeks in Electric Lady Land  
Two weeks and that's all for me  
I could be lucky and get off lightly  
With a broken nose and the third degree  
She said I really dig Disco music  
And if you want to be my baby  
We'd better talk about it  
Maybe then we could have an affair  
  
Maybe your heart is made of stone  
Maybe I'm just too blind to see  
Maybe your heart is made of stone  
Maybe I'm just too blind too see  
  
I want to drive East Coast to West Coast  
Turn up my radio set myself free  
Don't want to talk about it  
You and me should have an affair  
  
Maybe your heart is made of stone  
Maybe I'm just too blind to see  
Maybe your heart is made of stone  
Maybe I'm just too blind to see.

Heaven  
Is the home of all hearts  
And heaven  
Won't tear you apart  
  
Yeah,heaven  
Is the home of all hearts  
And heaven  
Don't tear you apart  
  
There's too many cares  
Want to hold you down  
And the world is a window  
Gone underground  
  
There's a hole in the sky  
Where the sun don't shine  
And the clock on the wall  
And it counts my time  
  
Heaven  
Is the home of all hearts  
And heaven  
Don't tear you apart  
  
There's a song on the air  
With a long pure line  
And a face in the glass  
And it looks like mine  
  
And I'm standing on ice  
When I say that I don't hear planes  
want to scream at walls  
I want to jump my chain  
  
Heaven  
Let me take you up  
Take you higher  
Take you up to the place  
  
Where you're gonna find peace  
Peace in your heart  
Peace in your heart  
You won't have to suffer  
  
You won't suffer  
There's a place in your heart  
Place in your heart  
Where there's peace  
  
Peace in your heart  
Peace in your heart

The drunk mortician lurches  
Past the broken windowed churches  
He starts to laugh and cry  
At the same time  
What really makes him drink  
Is the time he has to think  
And he knows that there is  
Nowhere he can hide  
He's got people making speeches  
Hang around like leeches  
To drink that heady drug  
Of untold power  
Their arguments are quoted  
And the winner then is voted but  
The loser always has  
The finest hour...  
So what are we going to do now  
On heaven and earth  
What are we going to do now  
Tell me what is worth to you...  
Doctors try to save them  
Priests don't know how to tell them  
There's nothing you can do but repent  
You might think that he's a hero  
But like Nixon Mao or Nero  
All you know is that they came... Then they went  
So what are we going to do now  
On heaven and earth  
What are we going to do now  
Tell me what is worth  
So what are we going to do now  
On heaven and earth  
What are we going to do now  
Tell me what is worth to you  
(Father and son) ad libs to fade

Hello, I love you  
Won't you tell me your name?  
Hello, I love you  
Let me jump in your game  
  
Hello, I love you  
Won't you tell me your name?  
Hello, I love you  
Let me jump in your game  
  
She's walkin' down the street  
Blind to every eye she meets  
Do you think you'll be the guy  
To make the queen of angels sigh?  
  
Hello, I love you  
Won't you tell me your name?  
Hello, I love you  
Let me jump in your game  
  
Hello, I love you  
Won't you tell me your name?  
Hello, I love you  
Let me jump in your game  
  
She holds her head so high  
Like a statue in the sky  
Her arms are wicked, her legs are long  
When she moves, my brain screams out this song  
  
Sidewalk crouches at her feet  
Like a dog that begs for something sweet  
Do you hope to make her see, you fool?  
Do you hope to pluck this dusky jewel?  
  
Hello, I love you  
Hello, I love you  
Hello, I love you  
Hello, I love you  
  
I love you  
I love you  
I love you  
I love you

Here Comes That Sinking Feeling  
  
Have you ever heard the sound of disappointment?  
It tangles your head like a winter rose.  
Comes up eager and shining  
And it likes to leave a scar before it goes.  
  
Here comes that sinking feeling  
(Can't keep it to myself)  
  
Nobody hurts me like you do.  
You cut into me like a poison dart.  
Creep into my sleep at night.  
Break into my dreams and tear them apart.  
  
Here comes that sinking feeling.  
  
Have you ever felt the sound of disappointment?  
It pounds in your head like hammer blows.  
Comes on gentle and smiling.  
And it likes to leave a scar  
Here it comes again no.  
Here comes that sinking feeling.

I once knew a pony  
Whose name was Survival  
He died in the winter of a happy revolution  
There were militant marches  
Over his dead body  
Children were crying and begging for mercy  
One  
Here we go again  
Two  
Here we go again  
We're all gonna be history  
Three  
Here we go again  
She's turning and turning, our American Sister  
Hands full of arrows and paperback bibles  
Like a boxing hero  
She stands in the ashes  
The voice of Martin Luther  
Through the radio flashes  
One  
Here we go again  
Two  
Here we go again  
We're all gonna be history  
Three  
Here we go again  
Oh here we go again  
Black snow in the fields again  
But tell me where is the friendship train?  
It's been a long time coming  
I once knew a pony  
Name was religion  
Head full of hatred and misguided morals  
He was blinded from reading  
Worn out and bleeding  
But he'll never give in, no  
Till the day he stops breathing  
Devil in the kitchen and the clock strikes nine  
His words are spoken in a voice sublime  
Apocalypse then and misery now  
Nothing you do is going to work anyhow boy

You got a dream, you've got it bad  
But it's just another one of those fads  
Just a joke, gone up in smoke  
Leaves you dangling on the end of a rope  
Lost your money in a parking lot  
It was funny but it's all you've got  
You're walking home, with sticky clothes  
And a very healthy overdose  
Oh Johnny it's you and you're a love child  
Oh Johnny it's you and you're a love child  
Ain't got no shoes  
Ain't got no job  
Ain't got no decent banks to rob  
Ain't got no rent  
You pitch a tent  
But the parking meter money's spent  
You need a girlfriend like a kick in the head  
Sleeping all night solo with the grateful dead  
Yeah you know it ain't easy  
Oh Johnny it's you yeah Johnny it's you and you're a love child  
Oh Johnny it's you yeah Johnny it's you and you're a love child  
Chorus repeats  
You've got a dream, you've got it bad  
But it's just another one of those fads  
It's just a joke, gone up in smoke  
Leaves you dangling on the end of a rope  
You're walking home, with stiky clothes  
And a very healthy overdose  
Yeah you know it ain't easy  
Oh Johnny it's you yeah Johnny it's you and you're a love child  
Oh Johnny it's you yeah Johnny it's you and you're a love child

Now Jerry was no architect  
But she sure knew how to put out all the lights  
I once watched her walk right  
Through a plate glass window  
And never even look hack  
Now here I am talking about all her good points  
I never did think she had any bad  
Though friends told me she could be cruel  
And vicious  
At one time she was the best friend that I had  
And I hope she can hear  
I hope she feels good  
I hope she was the best or everything  
And I hope she feels like a million dollars  
And I hope she knows I was always honest  
Now Jerry was a main-line angel  
She never came home at night  
She slept where the wind would take her  
In her P. V. C thigh length boots  
Make-up black and solid  
Fingernails bitten by teeth so close  
To perfection only marred by  
Seven years of obvious fake prescriptions  
That were one way or making  
Sure that she never saw the daylight  
Before wearing her sunglasses over  
Breakfast with her Italian girlfriend  
In a post blitz kid stupor  
Saying "How ya doin', Davy boy"  
You know you're such a trooper  
And I hope you feel good  
And I hope you feel like a million dollars  
And I hope you know that I was  
Always.... Honest

Well the sound of your voice on the telephone  
Make me feel distressed  
Make me all alone.  
Why do I feel so incomplete?  
When you're not here I'm just obsolete.  
  
My bed is burnin' all through the night.  
You're the only one that can make me feel right.  
Try to lay down my sleepin' head  
But I'm tossin' and turnin' around instead.  
  
[Chorus]  
I love you like a ball and chain.  
(Make it alright now.)  
Love you like a ball and chain.  
(Feels too good.)  
  
I'm a fool I know but I'm stuck on you.  
I'm a fool I know and it's makin' me blue.  
There's a river of blood.  
There's a river of tears  
I've been wasting all these years.  
  
[Chorus]

I don't care if you won't  
Talk to me  
You know I'm not that kind of girl.  
And I don't care if you won't  
Walk with me  
It don't give me such a thrill.  
And I don't care about the way you look  
You should know I'm not impressed  
'cause there's just one thing  
That I'm looking for  
And he don't wear a dress.  
  
I need a man  
I need a man  
  
Baby baby baby  
Don't you shave your legs  
Don't you double comb your hair  
Don't powder puff  
Just leave it rough  
I like your fingers bare.  
When the night comes down  
I can turn it round  
I can take you anywhere.  
I don't need love  
Forget that stuff  
You know that I don't care  
  
I need a man  
I need a man  
  
I don't need a heart breaker  
Fifty-faced trouble maker  
Two timing time taker  
Dirty little money maker  
Muscle bound cheap skate  
Low down woman hater  
Triple crossing double dater  
Yella bellied alligator  
  
I don't care if you won't  
Talk to me  
You know I'm not that kind of girl.  
And I don't care if you won't  
Walk with me  
It don't give me such a thrill.  
And I don't care about the way you look  
You should know I'm not impressed  
'cause there's just one thing  
That I'm looking for  
And he don't wear a dress.

I need you to pin me down  
Just for one frosen moment.  
I need someone to pin me down  
So I can live in torment.  
I need you to really feel  
The twist of my back breaking  
I need someone to listen  
To the ecstacy I'm faking.  
I need you you you  
  
I need you to catch each breath  
That issues from my lips  
I need someone to crack my skull  
I need someone to kiss.  
So hold me now  
And make pretend  
That I won't ever fall  
Oh hold me down  
I'm gonna be your baby doll  
  
I need you you you  
Is it you I really need?  
I do I do I do  
I really do  
I need you

Was it destiny?  
I don't know yet  
Was it just by chance?  
Could this be kismet?  
Something in my consciousness told me you'd appear  
Now I'm always touched by your presence dear  
When we play at cards you use an extra sense  
It's really not cheating, you know?  
You can read my hand I've got no defence  
When you send your messages, whispered loud and clear  
I'm always touched by your presence dear  
Floating pass the evidence of possibilities  
We could navigate together psychic frequencies  
Coming into contact with outer entities  
We could entertain each one with our theosophies  
Stay awake at night and count your REM's  
When you're talking with your super friends  
Levitating lovers in the secret stratosphere  
I am still in touch with your presence dear  
I am still in touch with your presence dear

It's alright - baby's coming back  
And i don't really care where he's been.  
It's alright - baby's coming back  
And i won't turn him around this time.  
  
I'll be your cliff (you can fall down from me).  
I'll be your ledge (you can lean upon me).  
I'll be your bridge, your flowering tree  
You can still depend on me...  
And i'll be (the ticking of your clock).  
And i'll be (the numbers on your watch).  
And i'll be (your hands to stop the time).  
I'll even be your danger sign.  
  
Chorus repeats.  
  
And i'll be (your grace your dignity).  
And i'll be (your night your destiny).  
And i'll be (your comfort and your ease).  
I will be your storm at seas...  
And i'll be (your sharp intake of breath).  
And i'll be (your work i'll take no rest).  
And when the world falls to decline  
I'll be yours and you'll be mine.  
  
Chorus repeats...  
  
(make it easy on yourself tonight).

It's Alright (Baby's Coming Back)  
  
[Chorus:]  
It's alright, baby's coming back  
And I don't really care where he's been.  
It's alright, baby's coming back  
And I won't turn him around this time.  
  
I'll be your cliff (you can fall down from me).  
I'll be your ledge (you can lean upon me).  
I'll be your bridge, your flowering tree

And when the world falls to decline  
I'll be yours and you'll be mine.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Make it easy on yourself tonight).

Turn it down so I can tear it  
Turn it up so I can see it  
It's just useless to ignore  
We're goin' down, you don't feel it  
Turn it around, you don't mean it  
And I can't stand it anymore  
When the whole world sighs  
And it's makin' you so deflated  
I've got a life, though it refuses to shine  
I've got a life, it ain't over, it ain't over  
I've got a way, it's the only thing that's mine  
All I'm asking for is tenderness, a little tenderness, tenderness  
Ooh, it's a cruel place, you never asked to be here  
Nobody cares and no one's gonna help you now, oh no  
It's dog eat dog, the human race  
The only thing they'll do is hate you, hate you  
Such a crime to be unkind  
You turn your cheek, pretend you're blind  
I've got a life, though it refuses to shine  
I've got a life, it ain't over, it ain't over  
I've got a way, it's the only thing that's mine  
All I'm asking for is tenderness, tenderness  
I've got a life, though it refuses to shine  
I've got a life, it ain't over, it ain't over  
I've got a way, it's the only thing that's mine  
All I'm asking for is tenderness, a little tenderness  
Be strong now baby, oh  
Gotta be strong now, baby  
Gotta be strong now, baby  
Oh, gotta be strong  
Strong now baby, oh  
Gotta be strong now, baby  
Gotta be strong now, baby  
Oh, gotta be strong  

I've got a lover back in japan  
He's got tatooes  
He's my superman  
I try to call him up from time to time  
We can talk about the weather  
Is the weather fine?  
  
And I say break, break  
Break away those ties  
Break, break.  
  
I've got a lover  
Up in outer space  
He's been tumbling around  
All over the place  
I like to call him from time to time  
We can talk about heaven...  
  
Break, break  
Break away those ties  
Break, break...  
  
When the whole world descends on me  
I'll be waiting for you...  
  
Got another lover in timbuktu  
Got a name for him  
He's my little guru.  
When I don't call him he starts to cry  
I have to tell him stories just to pacify.  
  
Break, break...  
  
When the whole world descends on me  
I'll be waiting for you...  
  
I was bitter when I met you  
I was eloquent with rage  
Like honey from a poisoned cup  
I flowed from stage to stage.  
(ooh... Sugar baby... Sing me a lullaby.)  
Japanese baby...

The truth of life is the greatest gift  
But I don't think I can make it fit  
And who would guess it would come to this  
When I've tried everything  
  
And I should know but I can't explain  
The endless noise sounding in my brain  
Who would've thought that you could feel such pain  
When you've tried everything  
  
Yea, you're a loser now  
Yea, you're a loser now  
  
I should be cool  
But I'm burning hot  
I should be good  
But I fell apart  
Don't look at me now don't even start  
Cause I've tried everything  
  
Yea, you're a loser now  
Yea, you're a loser now

Jack of all trades master of none  
Even got lost trying to find the M1  
Ended up in South Shields with a couple of drunks  
  
Moved to Crouch End suburb of cool  
Took a few drugs acted the fool  
Fell in love with a girl on her harmonium stool  
  
Went round the world in the back of a van  
We kept in touch with our only fan  
He was short and sweet lived in Japan  
  
The band broke up round a pool in Bangkok  
To tell you the truth it didn't come as a shock  
Our days were numbered like hands on a clock  
  
So we carried on me and the serious girl  
Had massive hits all round the world  
We got so big we both became ill  
  
Flew into London with a bit of a tan  
Caught the train back to Sunderland to see me old man  
We had bacon and eggs from the same frying pan  
  
To walk down the high street  
Avoiding a scrap  
"are you Dave Stewart?"  
"yeah"  
: you're a crap"  
Had a pint in the Beehive then home for a nap  
  
Got married in France to an Irish colleen  
I was thirty three she was only thirteen  
I wore orange but she wore green  
  
Now I sit and write plays for myself and my sons  
They keep me amused yeah I have much more fun  
Than big lines of speed at quarter to one  
On a peaceful Sunday morning

Jack talking, this is Jack talking  
He said I'm coming to London  
I'm sick and tired of the sun  
He said I'm coming to London  
I'm gonna have some fun  
I says Jack talking (Jack talking to you)  
Jack talking (Jack talking to you)  
He said Phew I nearly got married  
To a bride in black

She's always ready to attack  
That was Jack talking (Jack talking to you)  
Jack talking (Jack talking to you)  
Repeat  
I'm gonna tell him what to do  
Because he's such a fool he's always looking for the easy way out  
There's only love and hate time and fate  
The rest is the rest is the rest is...  
Jack talking (Jack talking to you)  
Jack talking (Jack talking to you)

And I love him  
Instrumental... He's divine  
What's he gonna say Jack swing it  
I'm goona tell him what to do  
Because he's such a fool he's always looking for the easy way out  
There's only love and hate time and fate  
The rest is the rest is the rest is...  
Jack talking (Jack talking to you)  
Jack talking (Jack talking to you)  
Jack talking (Jack talking to you)  
Jack talking (Jack talking to you)  
We better listen to that man (repeat chorus thoughout)  
Because he knows things well we don't understand  
He's got the world listening

Well I've had a lot of money  
I had a good paying job  
But all I want is for her to be happy  
To do something she can be proud of  
That's all I want  
That's all I need  
All I want is for her to keep loving me  
And that eternal flame  
Will remain we will sustain  
And that jealousy  
Ain't no part of me  
Jealousy ain't a part of me  
Jealousy ain't a part of me  
Jealousy so she can keep loving me  
Walking around with a  
Chap on my back  
(girls) this man don't care  
I don't care rat a tat tat  
All I want is just a little of your love  
I want to give you something baby  
That you can be real proud of  
All I want that's all I need  
All I want that's all I need  
For you to keep loving me  
Give you good loving  
Make you proud of me  
Give you good loving  
Make you proud of me  
Give you good loving  
Make you proud of me  
Give you good loving  
Make you proud of me

Make you proud of me  
Give me good loving  
Make you proud of me  
(girls) all I want and all I need  
Is you to keep loving me  
Just keep on loving me like the water to the sea  
Let it flow let it be  
Like the wind when it blows  
You can't see it but somehow you know it's cold  
All I need is for you to keep loving me  
And that eternal flame will remain  
We will sustain  
Jealousy ain't a part of me  
Jealousy no part of me  
Jealousy no part of me  
Then you can keep loving me  
Jealousy

(Julia)  
When the leaves turn from green to brown  
And autumn shades come tumbling down  
(Julia)  
To leave a carpet on the ground  
Where we have laid  
(Julia)  
When winter leaves her branches bare  
And icy breezes chill the air  
(Oh Julia)  
The freezing snow lies everywhere  
My darling, will we still be there?  
(Oh Julia)  
(Julia)  
When spring rejoices down the lane  
And everything is new again  
Will everything be just the same  
Will we be there?  
(Oh Julia)  
And the leaves turn from green to brown  
And autumn shades come tumbling down  
(Julia)  
To leave a carpet on the ground  
Where we have laid  
(Oh Julia)  
(Julia)  
When winter leaves her branches bare  
And icy breezes chill the air  
(Oh Julia)  
The freezing snow lies everywhere  
My darling, will we still be there?  
(Julia)  
Will we still be there?  
Will we still be there?  
(Oh Julia)  
Will we still be there?  
Will we, will we, will we?  
Will we, will we?  
(Julia)  
Will we, will we?  
(Julia)  
Will we, will we  
Will we still be there?  
Will we, will we  
Will we still be there?  
(Julia)  
Will we  
Will we be there?  
Will we, will we  
Will we still be there?  
Will we  
Will we still be there?  

Staying at home  
Plugging it in  
Kissing the screen  
Being a god  
I thought about it in the Galleria  
Liquid crystal like a man ray tear  
A shiny surface, velveteen queer  
Bailey contrast, a Lucas idea  
I've seen your set up and it's perfect in form  
Let's call somebody to connect both our arms  
You bring the orange I'll bring the clock  
We'll pay the dream police to circle the block  
Staying al home  
Plugging it in  
Kissing the screen  
And being a god  
Slaying at home  
Plugging it in  
Lucking the screen  
And being a god

When I was just seventeen I ran away from home  
To be with all the pretty people  
To be on my own  
Bright lights and trains and bedsit stains  
And pavements paved with gold  
And I believed in everything that everybody told me  
Have mercy  
Have mercy on me  
I found myself in a lonely place with a suitcase full of dreams  
And I soon grew up to realise what living in the doghouse means  
But everyday I told myself good things would happen soon  
'Cause I knew that was going to be a legend in my living room  
Have mercy  
Have mercy on me  
(Welcome to this perfect world)  
Now everyday on a dead street is where I spend my time  
The dust has been collecting on the corners of my mind  
But I've she'd my tears in bitter drops until the thorn trees bloomed  
To take the spiky fruit to crown myself the Queen of doom  
Have mercy  
Have mercy

Come into these arms again  
And lay your body down  
The rhythm of this trembling heart  
Is beating like a drum  
It beats for you  
It bleeds for you  
It knows not how it sounds  
For it is the drum of drums  
It is the song of songs  
  
Once I had the rarest rose  
That ever deigned to bloom  
Cruel winter chilled the bud  
And stole my flower too soon  
Oh loneliness, Oh hopelessness  
To search the ends of time  
For there is in all the world  
No greater love than mine  
  
Love oh love oh love oh love...  
Still falls the rain  
Love oh love oh love oh love...  
Still falls the night  
Love oh love oh love oh love...  
Be mine forever  
Love oh love oh love oh love...  
  
Let me be the only one  
To keep you from the cold  
Now the floor of heaven's laid  
With stars of brightest gold  
They shine for you, they shine for you  
They burn for all to see  
Come into these arms again  
And set this spirit free  
  
(set it free set it free)

Well I was born an original sinner.  
I was borne from original sin.  
And if I had a dollar bill  
For all the things I've done  
There'd be a mountain of money  
Piled up to my chin  
  
My mother told me good  
My mother told me strong.  
She said "Be true to yourself  
And you can't go wrong."  
"But there's just one thing  
That you must understand."  
"You can fool with your brother  
But don't mess with a missionary man."  
  
Don't mess with a missionary man.  
Don't mess with a missionary man.  
  
Well the missionary man  
He's got god on his side.  
He's got the saints and apostles  
Backin' up from behind.  
Black eyed looks from those bible books.  
He's a man with a mission  
Got a serious mind.  
There was a woman in the jungle  
And a monkey on a tree.  
The missionary man he was followin' me.  
He said "Stop what you're doing."  
"Get down upon your knees."  
"I've a message for you that you better believe."

Money can't buy it...baby  
Sex can't buy it...baby  
Drugs can't buy it...baby  
You can't buy it...baby  
I believe that love alone might do these things for you  
I believe in love alone yea yea  
Take the power to set you free  
Kick down the door and throw away the key  
Give up your needs...  
Your poisoned seeds  
Find yourself elected to a different kind of creed  
I believe that love alone might do these things for you  
I believe that love alone might do these things for you  
I believe in the power of creation  
I believe in the good vibration  
I believe in love alone yea yea  
Won't somebody tell me what we're coming to  
I might take forever till we watch those dreams come true  
All the money in the world won't buy you peace of mind  
You can have it all but you still won't be satisfied  
Money can't buy it...baby  
Sex can't buy it...baby  
Drugs can't buy it...baby  
You can't buy it...baby  
Now..  
Hear this  
Pay attention to me  
'Cause I'm a rich white girl and it's plain to see  
I got every kind of thing that the money can buy  
Let me tell you about it  
Let me amplify  
I got DIAMONDS...  
You heard about those  
I got so many that I can't close my safe at night in the dark  
Lying awake in a sick dream  
I believe that love alone might do these things for you  
I believe that love alone might do these things for you  
I believe in the power of creation  
I believe in the good vibration  
I believe in love alone yea yea

My place  
Some people say it's  
Bad taste  
One thing that I can see  
They take themselves  
Too seriously  
My shoes  
They once were worn by  
Howard Hugues  
But I know  
I'm never gonna walk  
That way  
  
That's why I need you  
I need you  
There is no other girl  
In any other world  
No barbarella kiss  
Can make me feel like this  
I need you  
  
Tell me your stars  
I'll tell you what your chances are  
One thing that I can see  
You take yourself too seriously  
My place  
It might as well be outer space  
But I know it's always gonna be that way  
  
That's why I want you  
I want you  
There is no other chance  
No other circumstance  
No way to change the past  
Now is here to last  
I want you  
  
Have you ever been stood in the middle of the street  
With a mindful of doubt and the world at your feet  
When your heads full of rain on a bright sunny day  
And the words in your head are like cold lumps of clay  
Never feeling home was a place you belong  
So you get lost in the words of a Bob Dylan song  
Staying up all night with a royal marine  
Trying to learn the chords to Moonage Daydream  
  
That's why I need you  
And I want you  
There is no other girl  
In any other world  
No way to chage the past  
Now you're here at last  
And I need you ......

My true love is sitting on a pile of stones  
And he's wondering to himself  
Oh, where did I go wrong?  
My true love has found himself alone  
And he's sorry for it all  
And for the hurt, we've done  
And I've given more than I can take  
Fallen for the same mistake  
Promises were made to break  
What will save us now?  
And I don't want to remember  
And I don't want to remember  
My true love is a saccharine kind of pill  
That tastes too sweet for words  
And cannot be fulfilled  
My true love is a dangerous China cup  
With all the broken pieces  
That cannot be picked up  
Now all the colors left to run  
All the dreams have been undone  
Love has left me standing here  
Raging at the sun  
And I don't want to remember  
And I don't want to remember  

I'm never gonna cry again  
I'm never gonna die again  
I'll shed some tears for you  
I'll shed more tears for you than the ocean, the ocean  
I didn't wanna let you know  
I didn't wanna take your time  
I didn't wanna bring you down  
I didn't want to hang around you, around you  
So we're living in desperate times  
Oh such an unfortunate time  
I can't relate to you  
I just can't find a place to be near you, to be near you  
I'm never gonna cry again  
I'm never gonna cry again  
I'm never gonna cry again  
...  

Well in the morning  
When our day begins  
And it feels like cold cold steel  
And when the sun comes up  
It's like a new commotion  
You say nobody told you  
It would feel like this  
  
No fear no hate no pain no broken hearts  
  
You've got the killing gun  
Held in your hand  
It feels like cold cold steel  
And when the sun comes up  
It's like a new commotion  
You say shoot shoot shoot it up  
Shoot it up

One step nearer the edge  
And you take me so closer.  
One step nearer the edge.  
If I should fall will you throw me down your line?  
(Throw me. Throw me. Throw me.)  
You see when I fall I really go down.  
And it's so uneasying to think you are with me all the time.  
Yes, it's so uneasying.  
Are you really, really with me all the time?  
Will you pull me through the next time?  
Will you lead me though the next time?  
Will You pull me through the next time?  
Will you lead me though the next time?  
The next time?  
The next time?  
The next time?  
The next time? ..  
And I'm one step nearer the edge.  
And you take me so much so closer  
If I should fall will you throw me down your line?  
(Throw me. Throw me. Throw me.)  
You see if I fall, I really go.  
I go down. I go down. I go down.  
Down, down, down.  
(repeat)  
I go down.  
Watch me go.  
I go down.  
(to fade)

Stop the world, turn out the sun  
I'm so tired of it turning round  
Stop the world, call it a day  
Leave it all behind, leave it that way  
Peace, is just a word, is just a word  
Peace, is just a word, yeah  
Stop the world, just let it bleed  
Well, we've taken more than everything we need  
Stop the world, just shut it down  
(Just shut it down, shut it down)  
(Just shut it down, shut it down)  
There's no point in it spinning around  
I tell you little peace, is just a word, is just a word  
Everyday that peace, is just a word, yeah  
Stop the world, take it any where  
It's just that, living here is more than I can bear  
(More than I can bear, ooh)  
Stop the world, just pack it in  
Well, we've reached the point, where no one ever wins  
No one ever wins  
Peace, is just a word, it?s just a word  
Peace, is just a word, it?s just a word  
Peace, is just a word, it?s just a word  
Peace, is just a word, it?s just a word  
Peace, is just a word  
Peace, is just a word  
Peace, is just a word

Got tired of being gifted and tormented  
Signed, sealed, delivered, then resented  
I think I've lost a very nice part of me  
And even though I'm only half the man I used to be  
It feels good  
I'm flying high again  
Spinning round and round again  
I even like myself again  
I'm not exactly sure of what I'm after  
But I won't be happy until I get it  
I'm either innocent or just plain stupid  
What's the betting I'll regret it  
But it feels good  
Feels like I'm home again  
Feeling safe and sound again  
I even like myself again  
And it feels good  
I'm flying high again  
Spinning round and round again  
I'll never touch the ground again  
Feels like I'm swimming in a sea of beauty  
Feels like I'm going round the bend  
God defend me from my enemies  
God defend me from my friends  
Cos it feels good  
I'm flying high again  
Spinning round and round again  
I even like myself again  
And it feels good (possessed)  
I'm coming home again (possessed)  
Feeling safe and sound again (possessed)  
I'll never touch the ground again (possessed)  
Cos  
It feels good

I never had a lot of spendin' money  
I never had a lot of change to spare  
But darlin', do you think I worry  
Little darlin', do you think I care  
  
There's a whole lot of things  
In this restless world  
That a whole lot of money can't buy  
You can't get it from your pocketbook  
And I'm gonna tell you why  
  
Because it's precious  
Your love is precious, child  
Because it's precious  
Your love is precious, child  
  
All the different kinds of teas in China  
All the shiny little gems so rare  
Gold and silver and sparkling diamonds  
Won't ever with your love compare  
  
So take your cares and your troubles  
And send them all away  
And put them back where they all belong  
Forget about them for a day  
  
Because it's precious  
Your love is precious, child  
Because it's precious  
Your love is precious, child  
  
Because it's precious  
(Precious thing)  
Your love is precious, child  
(Precious thing)  
Because it's precious  
(It's precious)  
Your love is precious, child  
(It's a precious thing)  
  
A little of understanding  
Is gonna change your heart and soul  
It's gonna heal your broken spirit  
So make love your special goal  
  
Because it's precious  
Your love is precious, child  
Because it's precious  
Your love is precious, child

Sweetheart  
The sun has set  
All red and primitive above our heads  
Blood stained on an angeless sky  
Wipe your tears and let the salt stains dry  
Let them all run dry  
All run dry...  
Sweetheart  
Take me to bed  
That's where all our prayers are said  
Whispered silent in the night  
That's how all our dreams take flight  
Let them all go by  
All go by...  
For time will catch us in both hands  
To blow away like grains of sand  
Ashes to ashes rust to dust  
This is what becomes of us  
Sweetheart  
Send me to sleep  
Pray to God our hopes to keep  
Take our fears and make us strong  
Lead us to where we belong  
And let it all go by  
All go by...

Take me to a dark room  
And hug me to bits  
I just wanna be kissed so badly  
Right there  
On my lips  
  
Put the blame on me  
Put the blame on me  
  
Why did you close your eyes  
When I'm the one that's blind?  
Why did you close your eyes?  
That was too unkind  
  
Where are you tonight?  
Are you sleeping on your own?  
I need to know  
Where you are tonight?  
Are you sleeping on your very own?  
Tell the one that's lying with you  
To get right up and go back home.  
  
Put the blame on me  
Put the blame on me

I've got a delicate mind  
I've got a dangerous nature  
And my fist collides

I've got a delicate mind  
I've got a dangerous nature

And I'm stuck inside your head  
I'm a hungry Mohican  
I've got a razor blade smile  
So don't come near me  
I've got a singular style  
Fifteen senses  
Are on my plate  
All the things  
That you love to hate  
I'm an electric wire

Find me where the cold wind blows

She said revenge can be so sweet  
I like to take it when I can  
I need to play with the ones I hate  
I like to see them suffer  
  
It has to be dangerous  
It has to be refined  
It has to be skill full  
You need to take your time  
  
She said I take care  
Of my resources  
You never know  
When you might need them  
  
She said, "You got a snake,  
And that's a good example  
You don't even notice it until you're bitten,  
You learn to enjoy it  
  
I'm fast and I'm strong  
My reflexes are good  
It doesn't take long  
To achieve my deserved re

Give me two strong arms  
To protect myself  
Give me so much love  
That I forget myself  
I need to swing from limb to limb  
To relieve this mess I'm in  
'Cause when depression starts to win  
I need to be right by your side  
  
No one seems to touch me  
In the way you do  
Nothing seems to hurt me  
When I'm close to you  
I'm so full of desire  
When you set my head on fire  
I need to be right by your side  
  
Every single one of us needs  
Love, love, love  
Everybody needs to give and receive love  
Every single day can drag us  
Down, down, down  
But there's nothing left to fear  
When love gets into town  
  
I'm so full of desire  
When you set my head on fire  
I need to be right by your side

I have a dream about a lazy river  
After a drink or two  
I see myself in the water like a mirror  
But I don't see you  
  
So I'll meet you at the royal infirmary  
We can be together have some fun  
At the royal infirmary  
Maybe we can get along  
  
I had a dream about a bad connection  
I just couldn't get through  
I left a message with the operator  
A time to place a rendez vous  
  
I'll meet you at the royal infirmary  
We can be together have some fun  
At the royal infirmary  
Maybe we can get along  
  
We'll be dancing and singing  
Practise mudslinging  
And when things get scary  
We'll say three hail marys  
Drink till the morning then  
Off with the fairies  
  
I'll meet you at the royal infirmary  
We can be together have some fun  
At the royal infirmary  
Maybe we can get along

Words of power are killing me  
While the sun displays its teeth.  
All mockery is laughing  
All violence is cheap.  
  
She said,  
"These are my guns  
These are my furs  
This is my living room."  
"You can play with me there sometimes  
If you catch me in the mood."

She said,  
"I have this unhappiness  
To wear around my neck."  
"It's a pretty piece of jewelery  
To show what I protect."  
  
She said,  
"Everything is fiction  
All cynic to the bone."  
"So don't ask me to stay with you  
Don't ask to see me home."

Sex crime, crime  
Can I take this for granted  
With your eyes over me?  
In this place, this wintery home  
I know there's always someone in  
Sex crime, sex crime  
Nineteen eighty four  
Nineteen eighty four  
And so I face the wall  
Turn my back against it all  
How I wish I'd been unborn  
Wish I was unliving here  
Sex crime, sex crime  
Sex crime, sex crime  
Nineteen eighty four  
Nineteen eighty four  
I'll pull the bricks down  
One by one  
Leave a big hole in the wall  
Just where you are looking in  
Sex crime, sex crime  
Nineteen eighty four  
Nineteen eighty four  
Nineteen eighty four

Now there's a lifestyle  
With painted lips  
Now there's a lifestyle  
Everybody wants it  
But it don't exist  
  
And I said shame  
In the dance halls and the cinema  
Shame  
On the TV and the media  
Shame  
We loved you  
  
Now there's a lifestyle  
With fashion chic  
Now there's a lifestyle  
Everybody in it wants  
To be elite  
And I said  
"You with yer brand new shoes and  
You with yer greasy hair and  
You with your mother's pride and poetry  
Don't you want to feel the shame?"  
  
In the dance halls  
Can't you feel the shame?  
And the TV  
Can't you feel the shame?  
We loved you  
  
Shame  
In the dance halls and the cinema  
Shame  
On the TV and the media  
Shame  
We loved you  
  
At the Lido and the opera  
Shame  
At the races  
And the theater  
Shame  
We loved you.  
  
And they said all we need is love  
All we need is love  
With the Beatles and the Rolling Stones.  
Day after day  
Day after day

She's good  
But not religious good  
She's kind  
But not all the time  
She says funny things  
We get happy  
  
She's bad  
But not religious bad  
She smiles  
But not all the time  
She puts funny things in my coffee  
She asks questions like  
How many beans make five?  
She's alright  
  
Sometimes she gets ugly  
Sometimes she looks ill  
She's here to watch over me  
Her looks tend to kill  
  
She's blind  
But not religious blind  
She's wild  
But not all the time  
She drinks funny things  
We get touchy  
She screams and shouts a bit  
But she leaves me out of it  
She's alright  
  
Sometimes she gets giggly  
She won't then she will  
Sometimes she gets giggly  
Sometimes she lies still  
  
Sometimes she breaks glasses  
Sometimes she breaks hearts  
Sometimes she gets messy  
Sometimes she gets smart  
She's funny peculiar  
And funny Ha - Ha  
  
She's good  
But not religious good  
She's kind  
But not all the Timmy  
She says funny things  
She's alright  
  
She's bad  
But not religious bad  
She smiles  
But not all the time  
She does funny things  
She's alright  
  
She's blind  
But not religious blind  
She's wild  
But not all the time  
She drinks funny things  
She's alright

Takes a step back  
From the vacant chair  
Looking in the mirror  
While she's combing her hair  
Wipes the dust from a cup  
While she's cleaning up  
Wonders very slightly  
What she's doing there  
A simple reflection  
Can be too revealing  
Years are for counting  
Years are for stealing  
She's a mathematician  
Calculator  
Counting daily  
Counting forever  
Cold clean glass and a razor blade  
Fly on the table and a passing car  
Closes the curtain to keep in the shade  
Closes her head and now she's counting down  
Dust is collecting  
But she doesn't notice  
Counting for ever  
She's a calculator  
No-one can see her  
She's invisible now  
No-one can see her  
And the dust is collecting  

Now there was a time when they used to say  
That behind every great man there had to be a great woman.  
But in these times of change you know that it's no longer true  
  
So we're comin' out of the kitchen  
  
'Cause there's something we forgot to say to you  
We say:  
  
Sisters are doin' it for themselves  
  
Standin' on their own two feet an ringin' on their own bells.  
Sisters are doin' it for themselves.  
  
Now this is a song to celebrate  
The conscious liberation of the female state.  
Mothers  
Daughters and their daughters  
Too  
  
Woman to woman  
We're singing with you.  
The inferior sex has got a new exterior  
  
We got doctors  
Lawyers  
Politicians  
Too.  
Everybody  
Take a look around  
Can you see  
Can you see  
  
Can you see there's a woman right next to you.  
We say: Sisters are doin' it for themselves  
  
Now we ain't makin' stories and we ain't layin' plans  
  
'Cause a man still loves a woman and a woman still loves a man  
Just the same though -  
  
Sisters are doin' it for themselves.  
Now there was a time when they used to say  
Sisters are doin' it for themselves  
  
Sisters are doin' it for themselves

Somebody told me  
Somebody told me  
Somebody told me  
  
Something about you  
I didn't believe it  
I couldn't believe it  
I'm still reeling  
  
'cause I just can't take the blow  
Well there's laughter and love  
And there's a lot of pain  
I never wanna see your  
  
Pretty face again  
Full of forgiveness  
You're just twisted  
I'm a silly little saint  
With a halo of smiles  
But it makes no difference

Spiritual love spiritual love spiritual love  
That's what we want  
Spiritual love spiritual love spiritual love  
That's what we want  
Spiritual love that's what we want  
Spiritual love that's what we need  
Spiritual love that's what we always wanted  
Spiritual love spiritual love  
And we're living in a waste land with a cancer  
So deep rooted in the hearts of all men  
Whatwe need is a little miracle  
Well here is comes  
Spiritual love ah the spiritual love  
Spiritual love for the good of man  
Spiritual love we want a spiritual love  
Spiritual love for the spirit of the man  
Spiritual love in this world full of politics  
Spiritual love in a world full of leaders  
Spiritual love we want a spiritual love  
Spiritual love we want a spiritual love  
And he said I love you  
And I said I love you too  
To free the world it's an emotion away  
To free the world you must free your mind  
To free the world in an emotional way  
To free the world from the blind leading the blind  
Spiritual love ah spiritual love  
Spiritual love we want a spiritual love  
Spiritual love sing it loud for the spiritual love  
Spiritual love that's what we want  
To all my enemies  
To the power crazed dictators  
To all the far flung legionnaires  
To all the empty cynics  
To all the negative forces in the world  
To the non-believers  
To the corporation owners  
To their guilt ridden sleepless nights  
From the seven oceans (poetic license)  
From the beautiful mountains  
From the birds in the sky  
From the animal kingdom

I fell down on it Valentine's day  
Dropped my flowers in the rain  
And got carried away  
The tide was coming in  
I could have been sad  
I could have been amused  
But I was just in pieces  
It was then that I knew  
The tide was coming in  
Aaahh this pattern on the back of my hand  
It makes a joke of me and the veins are like  
Rivers in sand running out to sea  
Nobody slept on the night of the crash  
We were all covered in devil grey ash  
The tide was coming in  
I could have been dead  
I could have been underground  
But somebody decided I should stick around  
The tide was coming in  
Aaahh I know I'm just killing time  
But time is killing me  
My eyes are witness to this crime and looking out to sea

Stay by me  
And make the moment last  
Please take these lips  
Even if I have been kissed  
A million times  
And I don't care if there is no tomorrow  
When I could die here in your arms  
Even if the stars have made us blind  
We're blind we're blind  
So blind in love  
Sweet darling  
Don't you know that we're no different to anyone  
We stumble  
We falter  
But we're no different to anyone  
And all the winter snow has melted down  
Into a pool of silver water  
And we were standing in a thunder cloud  
Dark as your hair  
Dark as your hair

Sweet dreams are made of this who am I to disagree  
I travel the world and the seven seas  
Everybody's looking for something  
  
Some of them want to use you  
Some of them want to get used by you  
Some of them want to abuse you  
Some of them want to be abused  
  
Ooh...hey...ooh...aha, oh...  
Ooh...hey...ooh...aha, oh...  
  
Ooh...hey...oh...  
Hold your head up, keep your head up, movin' on  
Hold your head up, movin' on  
Keep your head up, movin' on  
Hold your head up, movin' on...  
(rpt 2, 1...)

I'd like to build a house  
Without any walls  
An open paradise  
With a waterfall  
Life is quite detestable  
For some with feeble minds  
  
Who always make the mistake of being someone else  
I always make the mistake of being myself  
  
I'd like to make a friend  
Without any flaws  
Who takes me for what I am  
And nothing more  
Life must be incredible  
For those who stay out late  
  
And always make the mistake of being someone else  
I always make the mistake of being myself  
They always make the mistake of being someone else  
I always make the mistake of being myself  
  
Life must be incredible  
For those who stay out late  
  
And always make the mistake of being someone else  
I always make the mistake of being myself  
They always make the mistake of being someone else  
I always make the mistake of being myself

If I could find a way  
To soothe your troubled mind  
Then I would erase your fears  
And help you to unwind.  
I would ease the burden  
That you carry everyday.  
Oh, don't you know I'd find a cure  
And take your pain away.  
  
Take your pain away  
Take your pain away  
  
And even though you're far from here  
Don't forget I'm always near.  
Find comfort in these words I send  
In this cold world.  
  
Take your pain away  
Take your pain away  
  
For every aching heart  
For every broken soul  
  
So give up your worries  
They'll only do you harm.  
There is no need to be concerned  
It's just a false alarm.

Once upon a time there was a funny girl  
Who fell for a funny boy  
They built a funny house and made some funny kids  
And christened it the house of holy joy  
  
If forever meant forever that was the place  
Or so she told her friends  
But the city took her lovers to another world  
Left her waiting for the flowers to bloom again  
  
And she laughed  
And she cried  
She damn near died  
On the day it rained forever  
  
She walked around the garden with an empty mind  
Feeling tired and worn  
Not exactly sure what she was meant to find  
Heaven knows maybe a rose without a thorn  
  
She laughed  
She cried  
She damn near died  
On the day it rained forever

I heard you scratching on my back door  
I could smell what you come here for  
You brought your politics and glue  
And your phoney piece of paper too  
Yeah you'll be shaking in your shoes  
When I tell everybody the news  
The devil's just been using you  
The devil's just been using you  
The devil's just been using you  
The devil's just been using you  
I saw you walking all alone  
Your face was hollow to the bone  
You were talking to St. John about a revolution  
That was the kind of trip you're on total destruction  
Yeah you'll be turning in your grave  
It's just no way to behave  
The devil's just been using you  
[Bridge:] after instrumental  
Yeah you'll be shivering inside  
When you realise  
The devil's just been using you  
The devil's just been using you (repeat)  
(chant at end)  
Peace will never come into your life if you believe the  
Words he whispers in your mind it's just a piece of  
Conciousness that hangs around to let us know that  
Love is waiting to embrace us all

The first cut  
Is a criminal thing  
The first cut  
Goes deeper in  
Each impression  
Makes a chain reaction  
Each impression  
Will never be never be never be never be broken  
I'm a white girl  
You can see my skin  
Look at this picture  
That I'm living in  
And old scores never settle down  
I'll keep on walking  
Till I'm buried in the cold ground  
Cold ground, cold cold ground  
Each impression  
Makes a chain reaction  
Each impression  
Will never be never be never be never be broken  
The first cut  
The first cut  
The first cut  
The first cut  
The first cut  
The first cut  
The first cut  
...  

Well the first time that I saw you  
You were standing in the rain.  
You were waiting at the station  
For the last connecting train.  
Well, who will you go to  
When there's no-one to betray?  
And I said, who will you go to  
When your best friend turns away?  
Hey hey  
  
Last time you're gonna let me down.  
Last time you're gonna  
Fool around with me  
  
There's a garden full of roses,  
There's a necklace full of pearls.  
You have come to take the roses  
To give to other girls.  
Well, I am just a pretty thing  
You wanted for a day.  
There is nothing left between us  
There is nothing left to say,  
Hey hey  
  
People like you  
Can be so mean.  
People like you  
Just don't come clean.

How many sorrows  
Do you try to hide  
In a world of illusion  
That's covering your mind?  
I'll show you something good  
Oh I'll show you something good.  
When you open your mind  
You'll discover the sign  
That there's something  
You're longing to find  
  
[Chorus:]  
The miracle of love  
Will take away your pain  
When the miracle of love  
Comes your way again.  
  
Cruel is the night  
That covers up your fears.  
Tender is the one  
That wipes away your tears.  
There must be a bitter breeze  
To make you sting so viciously  
They say the greatest coward  
Can hurt the most ferociously.  
But I'll show you something good.  
Oh I'll show you something good.  
If you open your heart  
You can make a start  
When your crumbling world falls apart.  
  
[Chorus]

Maybe I should go to bed  
Maybe I'm the glutton for the truth  
You've got me standing on my head  
Trying to put on someone else's shoes  
  
And  
The thought of you  
Keeps the gates of heaven open wide  
The thought of you  
Keeps this stupid brain of mine alive  
  
I promise you a miracle  
I promise you everything he is  
Please don't get hysterical  
Can't you see I'm trying to take the piss  
  
But-  
The thought of you  
Keeps the gates of heaven open wide  
The thought of you  
Keeps this stupid brain on mine alive  
  
You float around inside my head  
Going from one extreme to the other  
But words like these should go unsaid  
So I'll keep y big mouth shut forever  
  
And  
The thought of you  
Keeps the gates of heaven open wide  
The thought of you  
Keeps this stupid brain of mine alive  
  
The thought of you  
Is enough to make a million angels sing  
The thought of you  
Make the bells of hell go ting a ling a ling

The trouble with lovers  
They don't know how to say no  
The trouble with lovers  
They don't know when to let go  
They drink too much coffee  
Smoke too many cigarettes  
Stay up all night to  
Watch Woody Allen  
Truth equals beauty  
Sun equals laughter  
That's all they're after  
  
And God only knows  
I'd like to be there too  
With Jackie Onassis  
But if not then maybe you  
The trouble with lovers  
The trouble with lovers  
  
The trouble with us is  
We don't give each other a chance  
The trouble with us is  
We're living in cloud Disneyland  
We try to be happy  
We're never happy  
Try not to argue  
Then start to argue  
Truth equals beauty  
Sun equals laughter  
That's all we're after  
  
And God only knows  
I want to be with you  
But Jackie Onassis  
Will probably be there too  
The trouble with us is  
The trouble with us is  
  
Let's put on our raincoats  
And walk through the rainy day blue  
Go searching for something  
Without really having a clue  
We'll drink too much coffee  
Eat too much chocolate  
Watch Thirtysomething  
Never stop laughing  
Truth equals beauty  
Sun equals laughter  
That's all we're after  
  
And God only knows  
God only knows  
  
The trouble with lovers (I want to be with you)  
  
The trouble with lovers  
The trouble with lovers

I could be contended  
I don't need to suffer  
You're beautiful  
Good to talk to  
You make an impression  
To take my attention  
And when you touch my skin  
I smell disaster  
  
Step away, walk away  
All I want is the real thing  
(nothing but the real thing)  
  
Walking on pavements  
We collect in bars  
Asleep in the houses  
So alone,  
Looking inside herself  
She breaks the glass  
Turns her head backwards  
She's fallen down again

No one on earth could feel like this  
I'm thrown and overflown with bliss  
There must be an angel  
Playing with my heart  
  
I walk into an empty room  
And suddenly my heart goes boom  
It's an orchestra of angels  
And they're playing with my heart  
(Must be talking to an angel)  
  
No one on earth could feel like this  
I'm thrown and overflown with bliss  
There must be an angel  
Playing with my heart  
  
And when I think that I'm alone  
It seems there's more of us at home  
It's a multitude of angels  
And they're playing with my heart  
  
I must be hallucinating  
Watching angels celebrating  
Could this be reactivating  
All my senses dislocating  
This must be a strange deception  
By celestial intervention  
Leavin' me the recollection  
Of your heavenly connection

Esta es la casa (This is the house)  
Este es el cerro (This is the hill)  
Esta es la historia (This is the story)  
Es algo chiquitito (It's a little thing)  
  
This is the house  
This is the hill  
This is the story, it's a little thing  
A lock of hair  
An invisible smoke trail  
Nothing there but the dust and the rust  
Oh, oh, oh everything changes  
  
This is your picture (it's in black and white)  
This is the family having a party  
There's a crack in the ceiling  
And there's an open door  
Nothing there but the dust and the rust  
Oh, oh, oh everything changes

I was out there in the middle of the day  
Trying to make love to a shopping arcade  
In northern England...  
Outside it was raining and I was feeling insecure  
Sooner or later you got to face the fact  
This world is shattered and it's too full of cracks to fill in  
So we just give in on a Thursday afternoon...  
In this little town where the traffic moves slow in the pouring rain  
I want to take you there where the four winds blow  
To be born again  
I was out there with the Beatles and the Cranks  
Trying to make some money and not to fall into the ranks of suburbia  
With Richard Toomey a visionary ghost...  
Sooner or later we make the same mistakes  
Our pockets are all empty and our spirit starts to break  
Just uke a baby left in the car park on a foggy new years eve...  
In this little town where winter begins  
In the summertime (summertime)  
I want to take you there  
Wash away our sins  
And be born again  
I was talking to some friends of mine trying to make some sense  
After drinking a case of wine from Yugoslavia but just before  
Breakfast we all started to agree... (wich was very unusual for us)  
In this little town  
In this little town  
In this little town  
In the pouring rain  
I want to take you there  
To be born again  
In this little town  
In the summertime  
I want to take you there  
And be born again  
Born again...

Thorn in my side.  
You know that's all you ever were.  
A bundle of lies.  
You know that's all that it was worth  
I should have known better  
But I trusted you at first.  
I should have known better  
But I got what I deserved  
  
To run away from you  
Was all that I could do.  
To run away from you  
Was all that I could do.  
  
Thorn in my side.  
You know that's all you'll ever be.  
So don't think you know better  
'Cause that's what you mean to me  
I was feeling complicated.  
I was feeling low.  
Now everytime I think of you  
I shiver to the bone  
  
[Chorus]

You have to learn to love my loving  
Turn around and say you care  
You have to learn to give by giving  
Give me a beatnik love affair  
We'll watch the shooting stars go crazy  
So what d'ya say, a definite maybe  
Should we walk into the wind  
Maybe fall when autumn falls  
Let's walk into the wind  
You have to learn to touch by touching  
  
Touch me, touch me if you dare  
We've reached the end of the beginning  
In this beatnik love affair  
Should we walk into the wind  
Maybe fall when autumn falls  
Let's walk into the wind  
Before you taste another tear my love  
I know a place where rainbows end  
The kingdom of the final kiss is but a breath away  
Here come those shooting stars again  
  
Should we walk into the wind  
Maybe fall when autumn falls  
Let's walk into the wind

You were the sweetest thing that I ever knew  
But I don't care for sugar honey if I can't have you  
Since you've abandoned me  
My whole life has crashed  
Won't you pick the pieces up  
'Cause it feels just like I'm walking on broken glass  
Walking on walking on broken glass  
The sun's still shining in the big blue sky  
But it don't mean nothing to me  
Oh let the rain come down  
Let the wind blow through me  
I'm living in an empty room  
With all the windows smashed  
And I've got so little left to lose  
That it feels just like I'm walking on broken glass  
Walking on walking on broken glass  
And if you're trying to cut me down  
You know that I might bleed  
Cause if you're trying to cut me down  
I know that you'll succeed  
And if you want to hurt me  
There's nothing left to fear  
Cause if you want to hurt me  
You're doing really well my dear  
Now everyone of us was made to suffer  
Everyone of us was made to weep  
But we've been hurting one another  
And now the pain has cut too deep...  
So take me from the wreckage  
Save me from the blast  
Lift me up and take me back  
Don't let me keep on walking...  
Walking on broken glass  
Walking on walking on broken

You don't call me anymore  
But don't you think that I don't care  
I check the numbers every night  
Just to see if you are there  
Was it just another love affair?  
Was it just another love affair? Ooh  
My clock goes ticking through the night  
Counting the seconds I don't sleep  
I wish that I could turn back time  
But some things were never meant to keep  
Was it just another love affair?  
(Was it just a love affair)  
(Another love affair, love affair, love affair)  
Was it just another love affair?  
(Was it just a love affair)  
(Another love affair, another love affair)  
It will never be the same  
It will never be the same  
It will never be the same  
Without you  
(Oh)  
Will never be the same, will never be the same  
Will never be the same, will never be the same  
Will never be the same, will never be the same  
Will never be the same, never be the same  
And remember how we once were  
When you held me so closely  
We were breathing in the dark light  
There was no more pain  
One love, one heart, one soul together, ooh  
Was it just another love affair?  
(Was it just a love affair)  
(Another love affair, love affair, love affair)  
Was it just another love affair?  
(Was it just a love affair)  
(Another love affair, another love affair, oh)

We two are one  
We two are one  

Underneath your dreamlit eyes  
Shades of sleep have driven you away.  
The moon is pale outside  
And you are far from here.  
  
Breathing shifts your careless head  
Untroubled by the chaos of our lives.  
Another day, another night  
Has taken you again my dear.  
  
And you know that I'm gonna be the one  
Who'll be there  
When you need someone to depend upon  
When tomorrow comes  
When tomorrow comes  
  
Wait till tomorrow comes, yea yea  
Wait till tomorrow comes, yea yea  
Last night while you were  
Lying in my arms  
  
And I was wondering where you were  
You know you looked just like a baby  
Fast asleep in this dangerous world.  
Every star was shining brightly  
Just like a million years before.  
  
And we were feeling very small  
Underneath the universe.  
  
And you know that I'm gonna be the one  
Who'll be there when you need  
Someone to depend upon  
When tomorrow comes  
When tomorrow comes

Dear father I want you to see me now  
Dear father I really wish you could see me now  
Love was missing in the whole wide world  
Whole wide world  
Love was missing in the whole wide world  
Whole wide world  
Love was missing in the whole wide world  
Whole wide world  
You were missing in the whole wide world  
I've been dreaming in this whole wide world  
Been surrounded by the whole wide world  
I've been shaking in this whole wide world  
Been taken by this whole wide world  
Dear Mother I want you to hear me now  
Dear Mother I really wish you  
Could hear me now  
Love was missing in the whole wide world  
Whole wide world  
Love was missing in the whole wide world  
Whole wide world  
Love was missing in the whole wide world  
Whole wide world  
You was missing in the. whole wide world  
I was frightened by this whole wide world  
I've been hiding from the whole wide world  
I was fighting with the whole wide world  
I was slipping in the whole wide world  
Lost my grip in the whole wide world  
I've been tripping in the whole wide world  
Oh Brother

How many times do I have to try to tell you  
That I'm sorry for the things I've done  
But when I start to try to tell you  
That's when you have to tell me  
Hey...this kind of trouble's only just begun  
I tell myself too many times  
Why don't you ever learn to keep your big mouth shut  
That's why it hurts so bad to hear the words  
That keep on falling from your mouth  
Falling from your mouth  
Falling from your mouth  
Tell me  
Why  
Why  
I may be mad  
I may be blind  
I may be viciously unkind  
But I can still read what you're thinking  
And I've heard is said too many times  
That you're better off  
Besides...  
Why can't you see this boat is sinking  
(This boat is sinking this boat is sinking)  
Let's go down to the water's edge  
And we can cast away those doubts  
Some things are better left unsaid  
But they still turn me inside out  
Turning inside out turning inside out Tell me...  
Why  
Tell me...  
Why  
This is the book I never read  
These are the words I never said  
This is the path I'll never tread  
These are the dreams I'll dream instead  
This is the joy that's seldom spread  
These are the tears...  
The tears we shed  
This is the fear  
This is the dread  
These are the contents of my head  
And these are the years that we have spent  
And this is what they represent  
And this is how I feel  
Do you know how I feel?  
'Cause I don't think you know how I feel  
I don't think you know how I feel  
I don't think you know how I feel  
You don't know what I feel

Sleigh bells ring, are you listenin'?  
In the lane snow is glistenin'  
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
  
Gone away is the blue bird  
Here to stay is the new bird  
He sings a love song as we go along  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
  
In the meadow we can build a snowman  
And pretend that he is parson brown  
He'll say, "Are you married?" We'll say, "No, man  
But you can do the job when you're in town"  
  
Later on we'll conspire  
As we dream by the fire  
To face unafraid, the plans that we've made  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
  
Later on we'll conspire  
As we dream by the fire  
To face unafraid, the plans that we've made  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
  
We'll go walking in a winter wonderland  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
Walking in a winter wonderland, hand in hand  
We'll go walking, walking in a winter wonderland  
In a winter wonderland

You know my love will never stop now baby

Take me to the desert  
Where there's got to be  
A whole heap of nothing  
For you and me  
Take me to the desert  
Take me to the sand  
Show me the colour of your right hand.  
  
Love is a temple  
Love is a shrine  
Buy some love at the five and dime  
A little bit of love  
From the counter store  
Get it on credit if you need some more.  
I'll the figure of your disgrace  
A criss cross pattern upon your face  
A woman's just too tired to think  
About the dirty old dishes in the kitchen sink.  
  
I wish I was invisible  
So I could climb through the telephone  
When it hurts my ear  
And it hurts my brain  
And it makes me feel too much  
Too much too much too much.  
Don't cut me down  
When I'm talking to you  
'Cause I'm much too tall  
To feel that small.  
  
Love is a temple  
Love is a shrine  
Love is pure  
And love is blind  
Love is a religious sign  
I'm gonna leave this love behind.  
Love is hot and love is cold  
I've been bought and I've been sold  
Love is rock and love is roll  
I just want someone to hold.

You talk a lot  
You laugh a lot  
Yes you talk a lot  
You never stop  
No you never stop  
But you never talk about  
The way you feel  
The way we make each other feel  
You celebrate  
And cut a cake  
Yes you couldn't wait  
No you couldn't wait  
But you never thought about the way I'd feel  
The way you made somebody feel  
Do you believe in all you hear  
Your husband's sick  
Your sister's queer  
Your mouth is full of shaky teeth  
From dreams that make you disbelieve  
That all I've ever said and done was  
Wish you well and have some fun  
Have some fun
