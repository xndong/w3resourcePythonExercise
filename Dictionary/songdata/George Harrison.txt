Well, your railroad gate, you know I just can't jump it  
Sometimes it gets so hard, you see  
I'm just sitting here beating on my trumpet  
With all these promises you left for me  
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?  
  
Well, I waited for you when I was half sick  
Yes, I waited for you when you hated me  
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic  
When you knew I had some other place to be  
Now, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?  
  
Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously  
But then, now again, not too many can be like you, fortunately.  
  
Well, six white horses that you did promise  
Were fin'lly delivered down to the penitentiary  
But to live outside the law, you must be honest  
I know you always say that you agree  
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?  
  
Well, I don't know how it happened  
But the river-boat captain, he knows my fate  
But ev'rybody else, even yourself  
They're just gonna have to wait.  
  
Well, I got the fever down in my pockets  
The Persian drunkard, he follows me  
Yes, I can take him to your house but I can't unlock it  
You see, you forgot to leave me with the key  
Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?  
  
Now, I been in jail when all my mail showed  
That a man can't give his address out to bad company  
And now I stand here lookin' at your yellow railroad  
In the ruins of your balcony  
Wond'ring where you are tonight, sweet Marie.

Sunrise doesn't last all morning,  
A cloudburst doesn't last all day  
Seems my love is up  
And has left you with no warning  
But it's not always going  
To be this grey  
  
All things must pass,  
All things must pass away  
  
Sunset doesn't last all evening,  
A mind can blow those clouds away  
After all this my love is up  
And must be leaving  
It's not always going  
To be this grey  
  
All things must pass,  
All things must pass away  
  
All things must pass  
None of life's strings can last  
So I must be on my way  
And face another day  
  
Now the darkness only stays at nighttime,  
In the morning it will fade away  
Daylight is good  
At arriving at the right time  
It's not always  
Going to be this grey  
  
All things must pass,  
All things must pass away  
All things must pass,  
All things must pass away

I'm shouting all about love  
While they treated you like a dog  
When you were the one who had made it so clear  
All those years ago  
  
I'm talking all about how to give  
They don't act with much honesty  
But you point the way to the truth when you say  
All you need is love  
  
[Chorus]  
Living with good and bad  
I always looked up to you  
Now we're left cold and sad  
By someone the devil's best friend  
Someone who offended all  
  
We're living in a bad dream  
They've forgotten all about mankind  
And you were the one they backed up to the wall  
All those years ago  
You were the one who imagined it all  
All those years ago  
  
All those years ago  
All those years ago  
  
Deep in the darkest night  
I send out a prayer to you  
Now in the world of light  
Where the spirit free of lies  
And all else that we despised  
  
They've forgotten all about God  
He's the only reason we exist  
Yet you were the one that they said was so weird  
All those years ago  
You said it all though not many had ears  
All those years ago  
You had control of our smiles and our tears  
All those years ago  
  
All those years ago  
All those years ago

Now I've watched you sitting there  
Seen the passers-by all stare  
Like you have no place to go  
But there's so much they don't know about Apple Scruffs  
  
You've been stood around for years  
Seen my smiles and touched my tears  
How it's been a long, long time  
And how you've been on my mind, my Apple Scruffs  
  
Apple Scruffs, Apple Scruffs  
How I love you, how I love you  
  
In the fog and in the rain  
Through the pleasures and the pain  
On the step outside you stand  
With your flowers in your hand, my Apple Scruffs  
  
While the years they come and go  
Now, your love must surely show me  
That beyond all time and space  
We're together face to face, my Apple Scruffs  
  
Apple Scruffs, Apple Scruffs  
How I love you, how I love you

There'll come a time when all of us must leave here  
Then nothing sister Mary can do  
Will keep me here with you  
As nothing in this life that I've been trying  
Could equal or surpass the art of dying  
Do you believe me?  
  
There'll come a time when all your hopes are fading  
When things that seemed so very plain  
Become an awful pain  
Searching for the truth among the lying  
And answered when you've learned the art of dying  
  
But you're still with me  
But if you want it  
Then you must find it  
But when you have it  
There'll be no need for it  
  
There'll come a time when most of us return here  
Brought back by our desire to be  
A perfect entity  
Living through a million years of crying  
Until you've realized the Art of Dying  
Do you believe me?

You don't need no love in  
You don't need no bed pan  
You don't need a horoscope or a microscope  
The see the mess that you're in  
If you open up your heart  
You'll see what I mean  
We've been polluted so long  
Now here's a way for you to get clean  
  
By chanting the names of the Lord and you'll be free  
The Lord is awaiting on you all to awaken and see  
Chanting the names of the Lord and you'll be free  
The Lord is awaiting on you all to awaken and see  
  
You don't need no passport  
And you don't need no visas  
You don't need to designate or to emigrate  
Before you can see Jesus  
If you open up your heart  
You'll see he's right there  
Always was and will be  
He'll relieve you of your cares  
  
By chanting the names of the Lord and you'll be free  
The Lord is awaiting on you all to awaken and see  
Chanting the names of the Lord and you'll be free  
The Lord is awaiting on you all to awaken and see  
  
You don't need no church house  
And you don't need no Temple  
You don't need no rosary beads or them books to read  
To see that you have fallen  
If you open up your heart  
You will know what I mean  
We've been kept down so long  
Someone's thinking that we're all green  
  
And while the Pope owns fifty one percent of General Motors  
And the stock exchange is the only thing he's qualified to quote us  
The Lord is awaiting on you all to awaken and see  
By chanting the names of the Lord and you'll be free

Baby don't run away from me  
Baby don't go  
Baby I'm always thinking of you  
Baby don't run away from my love  
  
You brought me everything I've wanted  
Lady don't go  
How could I ever live without you  
Lady don't run away from my love  
  
Way out there where the ocean is still  
A calm reflection in the sea  
Sat alone with the stars and the moon  
You turned round to me  
And love was in your eyes to see  
That's when it happened to you and me  
  
Baby don't run away from me  
Baby don't go  
Baby I'm always thinking of you  
Baby don't run away from my love  
  
Way back then it was easy to see  
A calm reflection in the sea  
Sitting still and without any cares  
You turned out to be  
A lover who was sure of me  
That's when it happened to you and me  
  
Baby don't run away from me  
Baby don't go  
Baby I'm always thinking of you  
Baby don't run away from my love

I'm thinking about the times you drove in my car  
I'm thinking that I might have drove you too far  
I'm thinking of the love  
That you laid on my table  
  
I told you not to wander round in the dark  
I told you bout the swans that they live in the park  
Then I told you about our kid  
Now hes married to mabel  
  
Yes I told you that the life goes up and down  
Notice how the wheel goes round?  
And youd better pick yourself up from the ground  
Before they bring the curtain down  
Yes before they bring the curtain down  
  
Talking about a girl that looks quite like you  
She didn't have the time to wait in the queue  
She cried away her life since she fell out the cradle

Let it roll across the floor  
Through the hall and out the door  
To the fountain of perpetual mirth  
Let it roll for all it's worth  
  
Find me where ye echo lays  
Lose ye bodies in the maze  
See the lord and all the mouths he feeds  
Let it roll among the weeds  
Let it roll  
  
Let it roll down through the caves  
Ye long walks of coole and shades  
Through ye woode, here may ye rest awhile  
Handkerchiefs to match your tie  
Let it roll  
  
Let it roll, let it roll  
Let it roll, let it roll  
  
Fools illusions everywhere  
Joan and molly sweep the stairs  
Eyes that shining full of inner light  
Let it roll into the night  
  
Let it roll, let it roll  
Let it roll, let it roll  
Let it roll, let it roll

Baltimore Oriole  
Took one look at that mercury, forty below  
No life for a lady  
To be draggin' her feathers around in the snow  
Leaving me blue, off she flew  
To the Tangipaho, down in Louisiana  
Where a two, timin' Jaybird  
Met the divine Miss O  
  
I'd like to ruffle his plumage  
That Baltimore Oriole  
Messed around with that big guy  
Till he singed her wings  
Forgivin' is easy, it's a woman like, now and then  
Could happen to thing  
Send her back home  
Home ain't home without her warbling  
How she can sing  
Make a lonely man happy, Baltimore Oriole  
Come down from that bough  
Fly to your daddy now.

My friend came to me  
With sadness in his eyes  
Told me that he wanted help  
Before his country dies  
  
Although I couldn't feel the pain  
I knew I had to try  
Now I'm asking all of you  
Help us save some lives  
  
Bangla Desh, Bangla Desh  
Where so many people are dying fast  
And it sure looks like a mess  
I've never seen such distress  
Now won't you lend your hand  
Try to understand  
Relieve the people of Bangla Desh  
  
Bangla Desh, Bangla Desh  
Such a great disaster  
I don't understand  
But it sure looks like a mess  
I never known such distress  
Please don't turn away  
I want to hear you say  
Relieve the people of Bangla Desh  
  
Relieve the people of Bangla Desh  
  
Bangla Desh, Bangla Desh  
Though it may seem so far  
From where we all are  
It's something we can't reject  
That suffering I can't neglect  
Now won't you give some bread  
Get the starving fed  
We got to relieve Bangla Desh  
  
Relieve the people of Bangla Desh  
We got to relieve Bangla Desh  
  
Now won't you lend your hand  
Try to understand  
Relieve the people of Bangla Desh

Never seen such a beautiful girl  
Got me shaking inside  
Calling on me from deep within her eyes  
Not the kind you go handing around  
Want to keep her right there  
But this love it don't come as no surprise  
  
And when I saw the way that she smiled at me  
I knew it there and then that she was A 1  
And then I felt the way she was touching me  
Was something I had known I was waiting upon  
  
Never seen such a beautiful girl  
Had me quickly untied  
Calling to me she made me realize  
Not the kind that is lost or is found  
She has always been there  
A lover needed for this soul to survive  
  
And when I saw the way that she smiled at me  
I knew it there and then that she was A1  
And when I felt the way she got through to me  
Was something I had know I was waiting upon  
  
Never seen such a beautiful girl  
Got me shaking inside  
Calling on me from deep within her eyes  
Not the kind you go handing around  
Want to keep her right there  
But this love it don't come as no surprise

Why are you still crying?  
Your pain is now through  
Please forget those teardrops  
Let me take them for you  
The love you are blessed with  
This world's waiting for  
So let out your heart please, please  
From behind that locked door  
  
It's time we start smiling  
What else should we do?  
With only this short time  
I'm gonna be here with you  
And the tales you have taught me  
From the things that you saw  
Makes me want out your heart, please, please  
From behind that locked door  
  
And if ever my love goes  
If I'm rich or I'm poor  
Come and let out my heart, please, please  
From behind that locked door

I don't want you  
But I hate to lose you  
You got me in between the devil and the deep blue sea  
  
I forgive you  
'Cause I can't forget you  
You've got me in between the devil and the deep blue sea  
  
I want to cross you off my list  
But when you come knocking at my door  
Fate seems to give my heart a twist  
And I come running back for more  
  
I should hate you  
But I guess I love you  
You've got me in between the devil and the deep blue sea

Watch out now, take care  
Beware of falling swingers  
Dropping all around you  
The pain that often mingles  
In your fingertips  
Beware of darkness  
  
Watch out now, take care  
Beware of the thoughts that linger  
Winding up inside your head  
The hopelessness around you  
In the dead of night  
  
Beware of sadness  
It can hit you  
It can hurt you  
Make you sore and what is more  
That is not what you are here for  
  
Watch out now, take care  
Beware of soft shoe shufflers  
Dancing down the sidewalks  
As each unconscious sufferer  
Wanders aimlessly  
Beware of Maya  
  
Watch out now, take care  
Beware of greedy leaders  
They take you where you should not go  
While Weeping Atlas Cedars  
They just want to grow, grow and grow  
Beware of darkness

They say they like it, now, but in the market it  
May not go well as it's too laid back.  
You need some oomph-papa, nothing like  
Frank Zappa  
And not New Wave they don't play that crap  
  
Tyr beating your head on a brick wall  
Hard like a stone  
Don't have time for the music  
They want the blood from a clone  
  
I hear a clock ticking  
I feel the nitpicking  
I almost quit kicking at the wall  
There seems a confusion, under the illusion  
That they know just what will suit you all  
  
Beating my head on a brick wall  
Hard like a stone  
Ain't got time for the music  
They want the blood from a clone  
  
There is no sense to it  
Pure pounds and pence to it  
They're so intense too makes me amazed  
Don't want no music but, they're making you  
sick with  
Some awful noises that may get played  
  
By beating their heads on a brick wall  
Hard like a stone  
Ain't no messing 'round with music  
Give them the blood from a clone  
  
Where will it all lead us  
I thought we had freed us  
From the mundane seems I'm wrong again  
Could be they lack roots, they're still wearing  
jack boots they're  
Marching somewhere in the pouring rain  
  
Beating my head on a brick wall  
Hard like a stone  
Don't have time for the music  
They want the blood from a clone

Day turned black, sky ripped apart  
Rained for a year 'til it dampened my heart  
Cracks and leaks  
The floorboards caught rot  
About to go down  
I had almost forgot.  
  
All I got to do is to love you  
All I got to be is, be happy  
All it's got to take is some warmth to make it  
Blow Away, Blow Away, Blow Away.  
  
Sky cleared up, day turned to bright  
Closing both eyes now the head filled with light  
Hard to remember what a state I was in  
Instant amnesia  
Yang to the Yin.  
  
All I got to do is to love you  
All I got to be is, be happy  
All it's got to take is some warmth to make it  
Blow Away, Blow Away, Blow Away.  
  
Wind blew in, cloud was dispersed  
Rainbows appearing, the pressures were burst  
Breezes a-singing, now feeling good  
The moment had passed  
Like I knew that it should.  
  
All I got to do is to love you  
All I got to be is, be happy  
All it's got to take is some warmth to make it  
Blow Away, Blow Away, Blow Away.

How many roads must a man walk down  
Before you call him a man?  
How many seas must a white dove sail  
Before she sleeps in the sand?  
How many times must the cannon balls fly  
Before theyre forever banned?  
The answer, my friend, is blowin in the wind,  
The answer is blowin in the wind.  
  
How many years can a mountain exist  
Before its washed to the sea?  
How many years can some people exist  
Before theyre allowed to be free?  
How many times can a man turn his head,  
Pretending he just doesn't see?  
The answer, my friend, is blowin in the wind,  
The answer is blowin in the wind.  
  
How many times can a dumb man look up  
Before he can see the sky?  
How many ears must one man have  
Before he can hear people cry?  
How many deaths will it take till he knows  
Too many people have died?  
The answer, my friend, is blowin in the wind,  
The answer is blowin in the wind.

Brainwashed in our childhood  
Brainwashed by the school  
Brainwashed by our teachers  
And Brainwashed by all their rules  
  
Brainwashed by our leaders  
By our Kings and Queens  
Brainwashed in the open and brainwashed behind the scenes  
  
God God God  
A voice cries in the wilderness  
God God God  
It was on the longest night  
God God God  
An eternity of darkness  
God God God  
Someone turned out the spiritual light  
  
Brainwashed by the Nikkei  
Brainwashed by Dow Jones  
Brainwashed by the FTSE  
Nasdaq and secure loans  
Brainwashed us from Brussels  
Brainwashing us in Bonn  
Brainwashing us in Washington  
Westminster in London  
  
God God God  
You are the wisdom that we seek  
God God God  
The lover that we miss  
God God God  
Your nature is eternity  
God God God  
You are Existence, Knowledge, Bliss  
  
The soul does not love. It is love itself  
It does not exist. It is existence itself  
It does not know. It is knowledge itself  
How to know God, page 130  
  
They brainwashed my great uncle  
Brainwashed my cousin Bob  
They even got my grandma when she was working for the mob  
Brainwash you while you're sleeping  
While in your traffic jam  
Brainwash you while you're weeping  
While still a baby in your pram  
Brainwashed by the military  
Brainwashed under duress  
Brainwashed by the media  
You're brainwashed by the press  
Brainwashed by computers  
Brainwashed by mobile phones  
Brainwashed by the satellites  
Brainwashed to the bone  
  
God God God  
Won't you lead us through this mess  
God God God  
From the places of concrete  
God God God  
Nothing's worse than ignorance  
God God God  
I just won't accept defeat  
  
God God God  
Must be something I forgot  
God God God  
Down on Bullshit Avenue  
God God God  
If we can only stop the rot  
God God God  
Wish that you'd brainwash us too

In another life  
I woke up dreaming with a sigh  
As the morning light  
Was painting whispers of a joy  
  
And I was in the candlelit bedroom  
Enchanting beauty shimmering magically  
Like an irridescent cloud  
Being blown by a westerly wind  
  
She can move your soul without you knowing  
She can take your breath away from heaven  
  
And I was captured by her loneliness  
A wounded tiger on a willowy path  
Like an opalescent moon all alone  
In the sky of a foreign land  
  
She can take your breath away from heaven  
She can move your soul without you knowing  
She can take your breath away from heaven  
She is like an everlasting blossom  
She can take your breath away from heaven

Bye bye love  
Bye bye happiness  
Hello loneliness  
I think I'm gonna cry  
  
Bye bye love  
Bye bye sweet caress  
Hello emptiness  
I know I'm gonna die  
Goodbye my love bye bye  
  
There goes our lady  
With a "you know who"  
I hope she's happy  
And "old 'Clapper' too"  
We had good rhythm  
(and a little slide)  
Then she stepped in  
Did me a favour  
I threw them both out.  
  
(Hmm) goodbye happiness  
Hello loneliness  
I think I'm gonna cry  
Bye bye my love bye bye  
(Hmm) bye bye love (Hmm)  
It's gonna be a raining out of doors  
(Hmm) hello happiness (Hmm)  
Goodbye my love goodbye  
  
Now I'm into romance  
I shy away from love  
Got tired of ladies (ooh ooh)  
That plot and shove me  
And that's the reason  
We all can (see) so clearly  
They see that our lady  
Is out on a 'spree'  
  
Bye bye love  
Bye bye happiness  
Hello loneliness  
Think I'm gonna cry  
  
Bye bye love  
Bye bye happiness  
Hello emptiness

I can see by your grin  
That you're trembling within  
It's all over town, cheer down  
And the smile on your face  
Is sometimes out of place  
Don't mind, no frowns, cheer down.  
  
If your hair should fall  
If your shares should crash  
You'll get by even without getting a rash  
  
There's no tears to be shed  
I'm gonna love you instead  
I want you around, cheer down.  
  
When your teeth drop out  
You'll get by even without taking a bite  
  
If your dog should be dead  
I'm gonna love you instead  
The world loves a clown, cheer down.  
I want you around, cheer down

Friends come and friends go  
As I go round and round in circles  
  
Love someone change your mind  
Decide he was a swine  
As you go round and round in circles  
  
He who knows does not speak  
He who speaks does not know  
And I go round in circles  
  
Dislike someone and will not bend  
Later they may become your best friend  
As life it goes around in circles  
  
He who knows does not speak  
He who speaks does not know  
And I go round in circles  
  
Soul takes on a body with each birth we make our date  
With life and death along the road the soul reincarnates  
The show goes round and round in circles  
  
When loss and gain and up and down  
Becomes the same, then we stop going in circles  
Round and round in circles

Have my love  
It fits you like a glove  
Join my dream, tell me yes  
Bail out should there be a mess  
The pieces you don't need are mine  
  
Take my time  
I'll show you cloud nine  
Take my smile and my heart  
They were yours from the start  
The pieces to omit are mine  
  
Have my love  
Use it while it does you good  
Share my highs but the times  
That it hurts pay no mind  
The pieces you don't need are mine  
  
I'll see you there on cloud nine  
  
Take my hope  
Maybe even share a joke  
If there's good to be shown  
You may make it all your own  
And if you want to quit that's fine  
While you're out looking for cloud nine

Bust my back on the Levy broke my strings on the BBC  
Found my chops on Eel Pie Island paid my dues at the Marquee  
Slagged off by the N.M.E. lost my stash and my virginity  
In this Cockamamie Business  
  
Got my face on Ed Sullivan broke my heart on the Soul Train  
Introduced to Bad Company lost cells down at Brain Drain  
And before I could mend lost the missus, missed the girlfriend  
In this Cockamamie Business  
  
Now we like to air condition though the air has no ozone ring  
Still they're chopping down the forest for McDonalds and the Burger King  
Eating cows with such persistence doesn't offer much resistance  
To this Cockamamie Business  
  
There are too many things stressing out the nervous system  
Girls you used to know fellas that may have kissed'em  
Some got rabies some got fleas some got incurable diseases  
From this Cockamamie Business  
  
Everybody's after as many points as they can get  
As long as it's not them that has to pay  
No one really minds the Debt  
5-Star actors, tax inspectors, film producers and directors  
With their Cockamamie Business  
  
Well you do what you can can't do much more than that  
(No you can't do what he just said)  
Some days you're pretty sharp on other days you feel half dead  
(While you make your daily bread)  
Didn't want to be a star wanted just to play guitar  
In this Cockamamie Business

Congratulations for breaking my heart  
Congratulations for tearing it all apart  
Congratulations you finally did succeed  
Congratulations for leaving me in need  
  
This morning I looked out my window and found  
A bluebird singing but there was no one around  
At night I lay alone in my bed  
With an image of you goin around in my head  
  
Congratulations for bringing me down  
Congratulations now I'm sorrow bound  
Congratulations you got a good deal  
Congratulations how good you must feel  
  
I guess that I must have loved you more than I ever knew  
My would is empty now cause it don't have you  
And if I had just one more chance to wind your heart again  
I would do things differently but whats the use to pretend  
  
Congratulations for making me wait  
Congratulations now its too late  
Congratulations you came out on top  
Congratulations you never did know when to stop  
  
Congratulations

I was so young when I was born  
My eyes could not yet see  
And by the time of my first dawn  
Somebody holding me they said  
  
I welcome you to Crackerbox Palace  
We've been expecting you  
You bring such joy in Crackerbox Palace  
No matter where you roam know our love is true  
  
While growing up or trying to  
Not knowing where to start  
I looked around for someone who  
May help reveal my heart someone said  
  
While you're a part of Cracerbox Palace  
Do what the rest all do  
Or face the fact that Crackerbox Palace  
May have no other choice than to deport you  
  
I welcome you to Crackerbox Palace  
We've been expecting you  
You bring us joy in Crackerbox Palace  
No matter where you roam know our love is true  
  
Sometimes are good sometimes are bad  
That's all a part of life  
And standing in between them all  
I met a Mr. Grief - and he said  
  
I welcome you to Crackerbox Palace  
Was not expecting you  
Let's rap and tap at Crackerbox Palace  
Know that the Lord is well and inside of you

He love your sexy body, he loves your dirty mind  
He loves when you hold him when you grab him from behind  
Oh baby, youre such a pretty thing  
I cant wait to introduce you to the other members of my gang  
  
You dont need no wax job, youre smooth enough for me  
If you need you oil changed Ill do it for you free  
Oh baby, the pleasure would be all mine  
If you let me drive your pickup truck and park it where the  
Sun dont shine  
  
Every time he touches you his hair stands up on end  
His legs begin to quiver and his mind begins to bend  
Oh baby, youre such a tasty treat  
But Im under doctors orders, Im afraid to overeat  
  
He love your sense of humor, your disposition too  
Theres absolutely nothing that he dont love about you  
Oh baby, Im on my hands and knees  
Life would be so simple if I only had you to please  
  
Oh baby, turn around and say goodbye  
You go to the airport now and Im going home to cry  
  
He loves your...

Tumbling through a thousand centuries

While the world wages war  
It gets harder to see  
Who your friends really are  
I won't let him down  
  
Got to do what I can  
I won't let him drown  
He's a far east man  
  
All these ups and those downs  
Makes me question what love is  
Is it a lie or worthwile  
I won't let him down  
  
Got to do what I can  
I won't let him drown  
He's a far east man  
  
Sometime is so short  
But it takes so long  
Wondering if it is  
Or if I'm wrong  
  
Even then my heart seems  
To be the one in charge  
Can only do what it tells me  
  
We can't let them down  
We've got to do what we can  
We can't let him drown  
He's a far east man  
  
Looks like right here on earth  
God, it's hellish at times  
But I feel that a heaven's in sight  
And I can't let him down  
  
Got to do what I can  
I can't let him drown  
He's a far east man

Chose a life in circuses  
Jumped into the deepest end  
Pushing himself to all extremes  
Made it, people became his friend  
Now they stood and noticed him  
Wanted to be a part of it  
Pulled out some poor machinery  
So he worked 'til the pieces fit  
The people were intrigued  
His wife held back her fears  
The headlines gave acclaim  
He'd realized their dreams  
Faster than a bullet from a gun  
He is faster than everyone  
Quicker than the blinking of an eye  
Like a flash you could miss him going by  
No one knows quite how he does it  
But it's true, they say  
"He's the master of going faster"  
Now he moved into the space  
That the special people share  
Right on the edge of do or die  
Where there is nothing left to spare  
Still the crowds came pouring in  
Some had hoped to see him fail  
Filling their hearts with jealousies  
Crazy people with love so frail  
The people were intrigued  
His wife held back her fears  
The headlines gave acclaim  
He'd realized their dreams  
Faster than a bullet from a gun  
He is faster than everyone  
Quicker than the blinking of an eye  
Like a flash you could miss him going by  
No one knows quite how he does it  
But it's true, they say  
"He's the master of going faster"  
No need to wonder why  
His wife held back her fears  
So few have even tried  
To realize their dreams  
Faster than a bullet from a gun  
He is faster than everyone  
Quicker than the blinking of an eye  
Like a flash you could miss him going by  
No one knows quite how he does it  
But it's true, they say  
"He's the master of going faster"  
No one knows quite how he does it  
But it's true, they say  
"He's the master of going faster"  

I know you're in the sun  
I know you're close to everyone  
At times it's like you don't have a hold on me  
  
I see you in the love  
I see you in the moon above  
But I want to know that you're not lost inside of me  
  
You know I need you  
You know I love you  
If I'm not with you  
I'm not so much of a man  
I'm like a fish on the sand  
  
You call me in the night (You call me in the night)  
And hide behind the daylight  
You're blowing like a wind, you don't let me see  
  
You know I feel a pain (You know I feel a pain)  
I'm tired of playing games with you  
Though there's nothing else I want that would set me free  
  
You know I love you  
You know I need you  
If I can't be with you  
I'm not so much of a man  
I'm a fish on the sand  
  
No use to no one else, they've all dried up  
Watching all our lives go by  
I can't believe you'd want to see me crying  
  
I hold you in my heart (Hold you in my heart)  
I know that you're a part of me  
But it's a must to know that you love me too  
  
I look you in the eye (Look you in the eye)  
You're swimming by my teardrops  
But I want to know for sure that you'll let me see  
  
You know I want you  
You know I need you  
If I'm not with you  
I'm not so much of a man  
I'm like a fish on the sand  
  
You know I need you  
You know I love you  
If I'm not with you  
I'm not so much of a man  
I'm a fish on the sand  
  
Not so much of a man  
More a fish on the sand

[Chorus:]  
I got my mind set on you  
I got my mind set on you  
I got my mind set on you  
I got my mind set on you  
  
But it's gonna take money  
A whole lot of spending money  
It's gonna take plenty of money  
To do it right child  
  
It's gonna take time  
A whole lot of precious time  
It's gonna take patience and time, um  
To do it, to do it, to do it, to do it, to do it  
To do it right child  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And this time I know it's for real  
The feelings that I feel  
I know if I put my mind to it  
I know that I really can do it  
  
I got my mind set on you  
Set on you  
I got my mind set on you  
Set on you  
  
But it's gonna take money  
A whole lot of spending money  
It's gonna take plenty of money  
To do it right child  
  
It's gonna take time  
A whole lot of precious time  
It's gonna take patience and time, um  
To do it, to do it, to do it, to do it, to do it  
To do it right child  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And this time I know it's for real  
The feelings that I feel  
I know if I put my mind to it  
I know that I really can do it  
  
But it's gonna take money  
A whole lot of spending money  
It's gonna take plenty of money  
To do it right child  
  
It's gonna take time  
A whole lot of precious time  
It's gonna take patience and time, um  
To do it, to do it, to do it, to do it, to do it  
To do it right  
  
Set on you  
Set on you

And I thought to close my mouth  
With a padlock on the night  
Leave the battlefield behind  
Stay out the fight  
Not lose my sight  
  
Now I only want to be  
With no pistol at my brain  
But at times it gets so lonely  
Could go insane  
Could lose my aim  
  
Now I only want to live  
With no teardrops in my eyes  
But at times it feels like no chance  
No clear blue skies  
Grey cloudy lies  
  
No clear blue skies  
Grey cloudy lies

I've wandered around with nothing more than time on my hands  
I was lost in the night with no sight of you  
And at times it was so blue and lonely  
Heading for the light  
  
Been close to the edge, hanging by my fingernails  
I've rolled and I've tumbled through the roses and the thorns  
And I couldn't see the sign that warned me, I'm  
Heading for the light  
  
Ooh - I didn't see that big black cloud hanging over me  
And when the rain came down I was nearly drowned  
I didn't know the mess I was in  
  
My shoes are wearing out from walking down this same highway  
I don't see nothing new but I feel a lot of change  
And I get the strangest feeling, as I'm  
Heading for the light  
  
Ooh - my hands were tired  
Jokers and fools on either side  
But still I kept on till the worst had gone  
Now I see the hole I was in  
  
My shoes are wearing out from walking down this same highway  
I don't see nothing new but I feel a lot of change  
And I get the strangest feeling, as I'm  
Heading for the light  
  
I see the sun ahead, I aint never looking back  
All the dreams are coming true as I think of you  
Now theres nothing in the way to stop me  
Heading for the light  
  
Now theres nothing in the way to stop me  
Heading for the light

Here comes the sun, here comes the sun,  
And I say it's all right  
  
Little darling, it's been a long cold lonely winter  
Little darling, it feels like years since it's been here  
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun  
And I say it's all right  
  
Little darling, the smiles returning to the faces  
Little darling, it seems like years since it's been here  
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun  
And I say it's all right  
  
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes  
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes  
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes  
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes  
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes  
  
Little darling, I feel that ice is slowly melting  
Little darling, it seems like years since it's been clear  
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun,  
And I say it's all right  
It's all right

(i'm not cheating)  
  
Oooh, oooh  
Everything is dinky doo  
Everything you do  
You, the king of la-di-da  
Pretty very out far  
Never oversits, he understands  
Like the back of the hand  
He should sing in a band, oh yeah  
  
Oooh, oooh  
People think he's loopey loo  
And when they look at his shoes  
He's a rocking sausage roll  
He gets it in the goal  
Healthy little 'brown affair'  
And when he washes his hair  
He'll get a round or a square  
Get them singing  
  
Oooh, oooh  
Everyone from oxford town  
Way down to the rio grande  
  
Knows his harbour quays  
His skin tight hands, without seggs  
His name is legs  
  
[talking]  
  
Oooh, oooh  
Coolies sweating in hong kong  
Run along to the mardi grass  
  
Risking asian flu to meet the man  
Who lays the eggs  
His name is legs  
  
He's a cure for whooping cough  
And if the going gets rough  
Get lined up, come sikh, come czar  
No matter who you are  
We could get along and slide a rule  
And if you don't play fools  
While larry plays pool  
You'll hear him singing  
  
Oooh, oooh  
[talking]  
Oooh, oooh

You can take a horse to the water but you can't make him drink  
Oh no, oh no, oh no  
  
A friend of mine in so much misery  
Some people sail through life, he is struggling  
I said, "Hey man, let's go out and get some wisdom"  
First he turned on me, then turned off his nervous system  
  
You can take a horse to the water but you can't make him drink  
Oh no, oh no, oh no  
You can have it all laid out in front of you but still won't make it think  
Oh no, oh no, oh no  
  
Someone I love has got a problem  
Some people thirst for truth, he would like a drink  
I said, "Hey man, this could be risky"  
He said everything's okay, as he downed another bottle of whiskey  
  
You can take a horse to the water but you can't make him drink  
Oh no, oh no, oh no  
You can have it all staked out in front of you but still won't make it sink  
Oh no, oh no, oh no  
  
Preacher at my church likes to talk about Satan  
Could be that he knows him, he acts like he's possessed  
I said, "Hey man, let's hear about God's realization for a change"  
He said, "We ain't got time for that, first you must hear of the evils of
fornication"  
  
You can take a horse to the water but you can't make him drink  
Oh no, oh no, oh no  
You can have it all staked out in front of you but still won't make it sink  
Oh no, oh no, oh no

Ok here we go, for this  
We got a b-side to make, ladies and gentlemen,  
We haven't got much time now so we better get  
Right on with it  
  
I don't care anymore  
And Ill kick down anybodys door  
To hold you in my arms once more  
Id go anywhere  
Yknow I don't care  
  
If your man should get uptight  
cause weve been alone for most of the night  
Now realize its our right  
To get back up them stairs  
Yknow I don't care  
  
Theres a line I can draw  
That often leaves me wanting more  
But its not so often that I feel so sure  
Nothing I can do  
To stop me falling more in love with you  
  
It can't be so bad  
What you want that you do not have  
Its got you too upset now  
I don't think its unfair  
Yknow I don't care  
Anymore  
And Ill kick down anybodys door  
To hold you in my arms once more  
Id go anywhere  
Yknow I

Looking back upon my youth  
The time I always knew the truth.  
I don't want to do it.  
I don't want to say goodbye.  
  
To go back in the yard and play  
If I could only have another day.  
I don't want to do it.  
I don't want to make you cry.  
  
To go back  
On the hill beside the track  
And try to concentrate.  
All in all the places that I want to be,  
No, it shows you that I could not wait.  
  
So come back into my arms again.  
This love of ours, it has no end.  
I don't want to do it.  
I don't want to make you cry.  
  
I don't want to do it.  
I don't want to say goodbye.  
  
I don't want to do it.  
I don't want to see you cry.  
  
To go back  
On the hill beside the track  
And try to concentrate.  
All in all the places that I want to be,  
No, it shows you that I could not wait.  
  
So come back into my arms again.  
This love of ours, it has no end.  
I don't want to do it.  
I don't want to say goodbye.  
  
I don't want to do it.  
I don't want to say goodbye.  
  
I don't want to do it.  
I don't want to make you cry.

Not a care for this world have I  
Only you keep my eyes open wide

Nobody else will do  
That's why I love you  
That's why, why, why  
  
Well babe you know I love you so  
I'd pay the world if you could know  
And when I see, you're comin' down the street  
My heart skips (a) beat  
  
You, I really really need you  
But yet you play me for a fool  
Why do you do me like you do, do, do

Let me into your heart  
Let me know you, let me show you  
Let me roll it to you  
  
All I have is yours  
All you see is mine  
And I'm glad to hold you in my arms  
I'd have you anytime  
  
Let me say it, let me play it  
Let me lay it on you  
Let me know you, let me show you  
Let me grow upon you  
  
All I have is yours  
All you see is mine  
And I'm glad to hold you in my arms  
I'd have you anytime  
  
Let me in here, I know I've been here  
Let me into your heart

If I needed someone to love  
You're the one that I'd be thinking of  
If I needed someone  
  
If I had some more time to spend  
Then I guess I'd be with you my friend  
If I needed someone  
  
Had you come some other day then  
It might not have been like this  
But you see now I'm too much in love  
  
Carve your number on my wall and  
Maybe you will get a call from me  
If I needed someone  
  
Aah, aah, aah, aah  
  
If I had some more time to spend  
Then I guess I'd be with you my friend  
If I needed someone  
  
Had you come some other day then  
It might not have been like this  
But you see now I'm too much in love  
  
Carve your number on my wall and  
Maybe you will get a call from me  
If I needed someone  
  
Aah, aah

Waltzing round the room tonight  
In someone elses clothes  
Youre always coming out of things  
Smelling like a rose  
You hang your head and your heart is filled with so much misery  
Youd be happy as you could be  
If you belonged to me  
  
You say lets go to the rodeo  
And see some cowboy fall  
Sometimes it seems to me youve  
Got no sympathy at all  
You keep on going on and on about how you're so free  
Youd be happy as you could be  
If you belonged to me  
  
It aint easy to get to you  
But there must be some kind of a way  
If only two could look to you  
For only one moment of each day  
  
Youre saying that you're all washed up  
Got nothing else to give  
Seems like you never figured out  
How long you have to live  
You could feel like a baby again sitting on your daddys knee  
Oh how happy you would be  
If you belonged to me  
  
The guy your with is a ruthless pimp  
Everybody knows  
Every cent he takes from you  
Goes straight up his nose  
You look so sad, you're going so mad, any fool can see  
Youd be happy as you could be  
If you belonged to me  
Youd be happy as you could be  
If you belonged to me

Isn't it a pity  
Now, isn't it a shame  
How we break each other's hearts  
And cause each other pain  
  
How we take each other's love  
Without thinking anymore  
Forgetting to give back  
Isn't it a pity  
  
Some things take so long  
But how do I explain  
When not too many people  
Can see we're all the same  
  
And because of all their tears  
Their eyes can't hope to see  
The beauty that surrounds them  
Isn't it a pity  
  
Isn't it a pity  
Isn't is a shame  
How we break each other's hearts  
And cause each other pain  
  
How we take each other's love  
Without thinking anymore  
Forgetting to give back  
Isn't it a pity  
  
Forgetting to give back  
Isn't it a pity  
Forgetting to give back  
Now, isn't it a pity  
  
[Repeat: x6]  
What a pity  
What a pity, pity, pity  
What a pity  
What a pity, pity, pity

(it don't come easy, you know it don't come easy)  
(it don't come easy, you know it don't come easy)  
Got to pay your dues if you want to sing the blues  
And you know it don't come easy  
You don't have to shout or leap about  
You can even play them easy  
Forget about the past and all your sorrow  
The future won't last  
It will soon be your tomorrow  
I don't ask for much, I only want your trust  
And you know it don't come easy  
And this love of mine keeps growing all the time  
And you know it don't come easy  
Open up your heart, let's come together  
Use a little luck, and we will make it work out better  
Got to pay your dues if you want to sing the blues  
And you know it don't come easy  
You don't have to shout or leap about  
You can even play them easy  
Please remember peace is how we make it  
Here within your reach, is your freedom to take it  
I don't ask for much, I only want your trust  
And you know it don't come easy

And you know it don't come easy

She was there at the bar, she heard my guitar  
She was long and tall, she was the queen of them all  
Last night, thinking about last night  
Last night, thinking about last night  
  
She was dark and discreet, she was light on her feet  
We went up to her room and she lowered the boom  
Last night, thinking about last night  
Last night, thinking about last night  
  
Down below they danced and sang in the street  
While up above the walls were steaming with heat  
Last night, thinking about last night  
Last night, thinking about last night  
  
I was feeling no pain, feeling good in my brain  
I looked in her eyes, they were full of surprise  
Last night, talking about last night  
Last night, talking about last night  
  
I asked her to marry me she smiled and pulled out a knife  
The partys just beginning she said, it's your money or you life  
Last night, talking about last night  
Last night, talking about last night  
  
Now I'm back at the bar, she went a little too far  
She done me wrong, all I got is this song  
Last night, thinking about last night  
Last night, thinking about last night

I know that I seem strange to you sometimes  
And who is it in here, you have often thought  
But what can I tell you  
That you don't know already?  
Yes, even the times like this  
Will roll away  
But I love you (I love you)  
I love you (I love you)  
That's all that I ever really wanted  
I know that it will work out all the same  
And whoever it is in here can overcome the pain  
A true friend's shoulder to lean on  
I'll make it through  
And over and over  
I feel for you  
But I love you (I love you)  
I love you (I love you)  
That's all that I ever really wanted  
Oh yeah, you know that sometimes a man  
He has nowhere to lay his head  
But what can I tell you  
That you don't know already?  
Yes, even the worst time like this  
Will blow away  
But I love you (I love you)  
I love you (I love you)  
That's all that I ever really wanted  
Oh yeah, you know that sometimes a man  
He has nowhere to lay his head, nowhere, I said nowhere  
Nowhere to lay his head  
Oh what can I tell you  
That you don't know already?

While all is still in the night  
And silence starts its flow  
Become or disbelieve me  
Left alone with my heart  
I'm learning how to love you  
  
While waiting on the Light  
How patience learned to grow  
Endeavor could relieve me  
Left alone with my heart  
I know that I can love you  
  
Love you like you may have never been  
Move you more ways than you have seen  
To a point in the time where we see so much more  
Than the ground that we touch  
With each step so unsure  
  
As teardrops cloud the sight  
Your eyes may never know  
No truth could ever fear me  
And left alone with my heart  
I'm learning how to love you.  
  
Love you like you may have never seen  
Move you more ways than you have been  
To a point in the time where we see so much more  
Than the ground that we touch  
With each step so unsure  
  
As teardrops cloud the sight  
Your eyes may never know  
No truth could ever fear me  
And left alone with my heart  
I'm learning how to love you.

Though you sit in another chair, I can feel you here  
Looking like I don't care, but I do, I do  
Hiding it all behind anything I see  
Should someone be looking at me  
  
While I occupy my mind, I can feel you here  
Love to us is so well timed, and I do, I do  
Wasting away these moments so heavenly  
Should someone be looking at me  
  
Let it down, let it all down  
Let your hair hang all around me  
Let it down, let it down  
Let your love flow and astound me  
  
While you look so sweetly and divine, I can feel you here  
I see your eyes are busy kissing mine, and I do, I do  
Wondering what it is they're expecting to see  
Should someone be looking at me  
  
Let it down, let it all down  
Let your hair hang all around me  
Let it down, let it down  
Let your love flow and astound me  
  
Let it down, let it down, oh  
Let it down, let it down, oh  
Let it down, let it down, oh

You are the One  
You are my love  
You send the rain and bring the sun  
You stand alone and speak the truth  
You are the breath of life itself, oh yes you are  
You are the One  
  
You're in my dream  
I hold you there in high esteem  
I need you more each step I take  
You are the love in life itself, oh yes you are  
You are the One  
  
You are the one that I'd die for  
And you're all that is real  
You are the essence of that which  
We taste, touch and feel  
  
You are the One  
No matter what  
You are the real love that I've got  
You are my friend and when life's through  
You are the light in death itself, oh yes are  
You are the One  
  
They call you Christ, Vsnu, Buddha, Jehovah,  
Our Lord  
You are, Govindam, Bismillah, Creator of All  
  
You are the One  
No matter what  
You are the real love that I've got  
You are my friend and when life's through  
You are the light in death itself, oh yes are  
You are the One  
You are my love  
You send the rain and bring the sun  
You stand alone and speak the truth  
You are the breath of life itself, oh yes you are  
You are the breath of life itself, oh yes you are  
You are the One

I'm living in the material world  
Living in the material world  
  
can't say what I'm doing here  
But I hope to see much clearer,  
After living in the material world  
  
I got born into the material world  
Getting worn out in the material world  
Use my body like a car,  
Taking me both near and far  
Met my friends all in the material world  
  
Met them all there in the material world  
John and Paul here in the material world  
Though we started out quite poor  
We got 'Richie' on a tour  
Got caught up in the material world  
  
From the Spiritual Sky,  
Such sweet memories have I  
To the Spiritual Sky  
How I pray  
Yes I pray  
That I won't get lost  
Or go astray  
  
As I'm fated for the material world  
Get frustrated in the material world  
Senses never gratified  
Only swelling like a tide  
That could drown me in the  
Material world  
  
From the Spiritual Sky,  
Such sweet memories have I  
To the Spiritual Sky  
How I pray  
Yes I pray  
That I won't get lost  
Or go astray  
  
While I'm living in the material world  
Not much 'giving' in the material world  
Got a lot of work to do  
Try to get a message through  
And get back out of this material world  
  
I'm living in the material world  
Living in the material world  
I hope to get out of this place  
By the LORD SRI KRSNA'S GRACE  
My salvation from the material world  
Big Ending

Oh Lord, won't you listen in to me now  
Oh Love, I got to get me back to you somehow  
I never knew that life was loaded  
I'd only hung around birds and bees  
I never knew that things exploded  
I only found it out when I was down upon my knees  
Looking for my life, looking for my life  
  
Oh boy, you've no idea what I've been through  
Oh Lord, I feel so stuck that I can't get to you  
Had no idea that I was heading  
Toward a state of emergency  
I had no fear where I was treading  
I only found it out when I was down upon my knees  
Looking for my life  
  
Caught up on me with intensity  
Had no idea where I was heading  
I only found it out when I was down upon my knees  
Looking for my life, looking for my life  
  
Oh boys you've no idea what I've been through  
Oh Lord, I got to get back somehow to you  
  
I never knew that life was loaded  
I only hung around birds and bees  
I never knew that things exploded  
I only found it out when I was down upon my kees  
Looking for my life  
  
I never got any any GCE's  
I never knew that things exploded  
I only found it out when I was down upon my knees  
Looking for my life, looking for my life  
Looking For my Life

Margarita, ah  
Margarita, ah  
Ooh  
  
It was in pittsburgh late one night  
I lost my hat, got into a fight  
I rolled and tumbled till I saw the light  
Went to the big apple, took a bite  
  
Still the sun went down your way  
Down from the blue into the gray  
Where I stood I saw you walk away  
You danced away  
  
I asked her what were gonna do tonight  
She said cahuenga langa-langa-shoe box soup  
We better keep tryin till we get it right  
Tala mala sheela jaipur dhoop  
  
She wrote a long letter on short piece of paper  
Oh margarita dont stay away too long  
Come on home  
Oh margarita dont say you will when you wont  
Margarita

Maya Love, Maya Love,  
Maya Love is like the sea  
Flowing in and out of me  
Maya Love, Maya Love,  
Maya Love is like the day  
First it comes, then it rolls away  
Maya Love, Maya Love,  
Maya Love is like the wind  
Blowing hard on everything  
Maya Love, Maya Love,  
Maya Love is like the rain  
Beating on your window brain  
Maya Love, Maya Love,  
Maya Love is like the stream  
Flowing through this cosmic dream

I'm the only one down here  
Who's got nothing to say  
About the war  
Or the rice  
That keeps going astray on it's way to bombay.  
And the smog that keeps polluting up our shores  
Is boring me to tears.  
Why don't you call me, miss o'dell?  
I'm the only one down here  
Who's got nothing to fear  
From the waves  
Or the night  
That keeps rolling on right up to my front porch.  
The record player's broken on the floor,  
And ben, he can't restore it.  
Miss o'dell.  
I can tell you  
Nothing new  
Has happened since I last saw you.  
And I'm the only one down here  
Who's got nothing to say  
About the hip  
Or the dope  
Or the cat with most hope to fill the fillmore.  
And your pushing, shoving, ringing on my bell  
Is not for me tonight.  
So, won't you call me, miss o'dell?  
Won't you call me, miss o'dell?  

Hey! mr. tambourine man, play a song for me,  
I'm not sleepy and there is no place i'm going to.  
Hey! mr. tambourine man, play a song for me,  
In the jingle jangle morning i'll come followin' you.  
  
Though i know that evenin's empire has returned into sand,  
Vanished from my hand,  
Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping.  
My weariness amazes me, i'm branded on my feet,  
I have no one to meet  
And the ancient empty street's too dead for dreaming.  
  
Hey! mr. tambourine man, play a song for me,  
I'm not sleepy and there is no place i'm going to.  
Hey! mr. tambourine man, play a song for me,  
In the jingle jangle morning i'll come followin' you.  
  
Take me on a trip upon your magic swirlin' ship,  
My senses have been stripped, my hands can't feel to grip,  
My toes too numb to step, wait only for my boot heels  
To be wanderin'.  
I'm ready to go anywhere, i'm ready for to fade  
Into my own parade, cast your dancing spell my way,  
I promise to go under it.  
  
Hey! mr. tambourine man, play a song for me,  
I'm not sleepy and there is no place i'm going to.  
Hey! mr. tambourine man, play a song for me,  
In the jingle jangle morning i'll come followin' you.  
  
Then take me disappearin' through the smoke rings of my mind,  
Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves,  
The haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach,  
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow.  
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,  
Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands,  
With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves,  
Let me forget about today until tomorrow.  
  
Hey! mr. tambourine man, play a song for me,  
I'm not sleepy and there is no place i'm going to.  
Hey! mr. tambourine man, play a song for me,  
In the jingle jangle morning i'll come followin' you.

Crimson flames tied through my ears  
Rollin high and mighty traps  
Pounced with fire on flaming roads  
Using ideas as my maps  
Well meet on edges, soon, said I  
Proud neath heated brow.  
Ah, but I was so much older then,  
I'm younger than that now.  
  
Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth  
Rip down all hate, I screamed  
Lies that life is black and white  
Spoke from my skull. I dreamed  
Romantic facts of musketeers  
Foundationed deep, somehow.  
Ah, but I was so much older then,  
I'm younger than that now.  
  
Girls faces formed the forward path  
From phony jealousy  
To memorizing politics  
Of ancient history  
Flung down by corpse evangelists  
Unthought of, though, somehow.  
Ah, but I was so much older then,  
I'm younger than that now.  
  
A self-ordained professors tongue  
Too serious to fool  
Spouted out that liberty  
Is just equality in school  
Equality, I spoke the word  
As if a wedding vow.  
Ah, but I was so much older then,  
I'm younger than that now.  
  
In a soldiers stance, I aimed my hand  
At the mongrel dogs who teach  
Fearing not that Id become my enemy  
In the instant that I preach  
My existence led by confusion boats  
Mutiny from stern to bow.  
Ah, but I was so much older then,  
I'm younger than that now.  
  
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats  
Too noble to neglect  
Deceived me into thinking  
I had something to protect  
Good and bad, I define these terms  
Quite clear, no doubt, somehow.  
Ah, but I was so much older then,  
I'm younger than that now.

They say I'm not what I used to be  
All the same  
I'm happier than a willow tree  
Shine or rain sitting here by a stream  
(Mmm) There's nothing I'd rather feel  
In this world  
You and your sweet serenity  
Rocking me  
Melting my heart away  
  
I know something so dear to me  
Beyond words  
Beautiful feeling in my soul  
Sounds I've heard  
Like humming birds in a dream  
(Mmm) That mystical one I knew  
Is returned  
Lulling me with those raincloud eyes  
Taking me  
Melting my heart away  
  
I am yes I am  
I know what I feel  
You came in my life  
Made me more real  
  
I know whatever we may have been  
In past times  
Has sorted the truth out from the rest  
Win or lose  
I always knew you'd be there  
(Mmm) You answer my deepest prayer  
In a song  
Shimmering slowhand flowing clear  
Moving me  
Melting my heart away  
  
I am yes I am  
I know what I feel  
You came in my life  
Made me more real  
  
(Mmm) That mystical one I knew  
Is returned  
Lulling me with those raincloud eyes  
Taking me  
Melting my heart away

Not guilty  
For getting in your way  
While you're trying to steal the day  
Not guilty  
And I'm not here for the rest  
I'm not trying to steal your vest.  
  
I am not trying to be smart  
I only want what I can get  
I'm really sorry for your aging head  
But like you heard me said  
Not guilty.  
  
Not guilty  
For being on your street  
Getting underneath your feet  
Not guilty  
No use handing me a writ  
While I'm trying to do my bit.  
  
I don't expect to take your heart  
I only want what I can get  
I'm really sorry that you're underfed  
But like you heard me said  
Not guilty.  
  
Not guilty  
For looking like a freak  
Making friends with every Sikh  
Not guilty  
For leading you astray  
On the road to Mandalay.  
  
I won't upset the apple cart  
I only want what I can get  
I'm really sorry that you've been misled  
But like you heard me said  
Not guilty

Gazed at the ceiling from below  
A splendid Michelangelo  
Filled my heart with delight  
Last Saturday night  
  
Arrived believing from home  
Climbed every step inside St. Peter's Dome  
Claustrophobic and ex-Catholic  
Last Saturday night  
  
Now how come nobody really noticed  
Puff of white smoke knocked me out  
The truth is hiding, lurking, banking  
Things they do at night  
  
It's quite suspicious to say the least  
Even mentioned it to my local priest  
One Our Father, three Hail Marys  
Each Saturday Night  
  
I wish somebody would tell me  
That it's only a show  
I'll confess, own up, let's face it  
In my concrete tuxedo  
  
It's quite suspicious to say the least  
While mentioning it to my priest  
One Our Father, three Hail Marys  
Each Saturday night  
  
One Our Father three Hail Marys  
Each Saturday night  
One Our Father three Hail Marys  
Each Saturday night

Have you see the little piggies  
Crawling in the dirt?  
And for all the little piggies  
Life is getting worse  
Always having dirt  
To play around in  
Have you see the bigger piggies  
In their starched white shirts?  
You will find the bigger piggies  
Stirring up the dirt  
Always have clean shirts  
To play around in  
In their sties with all their backing  
They don't care what goes on around  
In their eyes there's something lacking  
What they need's a darn good whacking  
Everywhere there's lots of piggies  
Living piggy lives  
You can see them out for dinner  
With their piggy wives  
Clutching forks and knives  
To eat their bacon  
One more time  

Rowers gliding on the river  
Canadian geese crap along the bank  
Back wheel of my bike begins to quiver  
The chain is wrapped around the crank  
  
Old ladies, who must be doggie training  
Walking, throwing balls, chasing all the sheep  
While the farmer stands around, and he's complaining  
His mad cows are being put to sleep and I'm a Pisces fish and the river runs
through my soul  
  
Smoke signals from the brewery  
Like someone in there found the latest Pope  
In a vat of beer that keeps pumping out with fury  
While the churchbell ringer's tangled in his rope  
  
There's a temple on an island  
I think of all the Gods and what they feel  
You can only find them in the deepest silence  
I got to get off of this big wheel  
  
And I'm a Pisces fish and the river runs through my soul  
I'm a Pisces fish and the river runs through my soul  
  
And I'll be swimming until I can find those waters  
That one unbounded ocean of bliss  
That's flowing through your parents, sons and daughters  
But still an easy thing for us to miss  
  
Blades go skimming through the water  
I hear the coxon shouting his instructions about  
With this crew oh it could be a tall order  
Have we time to sort all of these things out  
  
Some times my life it seems like fiction  
Some of the days it's really quite serene  
I'm living proof of all life's contradictions  
One half's going where the other half's just been  
And I'm a Pisces fish and the river runs through my soul

Poor little girl  
With her head in the air  
There's a poorly sick world all around you  
  
Poor horny boy  
One thing on his mind  
That poor little girl  
He must find you  
  
[Chorus]  
There's a whole lotta love  
Shaking inside of me  
And I must figure out why it's there  
  
There's a bottomless heart  
That's hooked into all of you  
And it's wondering how much you care  
  
Poor little girl  
With a whole in her heart  
There's a poorly sick world all around you  
  
Poor horny boy  
One thing on his mind  
That poor little girl  
He must find you  
  
There's a whole lotta love  
Shaking inside of me  
And I must figure out why it's there  
  
There's a bottomless heart  
Hooked into all of you  
And it's wondering how much you care  
  
Poor little boy  
Head in a whirl  
There's a phony slick world all around you  
  
That poor little girl  
With her head in the air  
That poor little boy he must find you  
  
There's a whole lotta love  
Shaking inside of me  
And I must figure out why it's there  
  
There's a bottomless heart  
Hooked into all of you  
And it's wondering how much you care  
  
There's a need and desire I have  
To express what's inside of me  
I must figure it out while it's still there  
  
And an endless amout of  
Of a joy that you touch me with  
Thought it's almost too much for me to bear  
  
Poor litte girl

Throughout my lifetimes I'd hesitate  
I'd feel some joy  
But before I'd show my thanks it became too late  
But now all the way I want to find the time  
Stop and say  
I thank you Lord for giving us each new day  
  
And as I think back over so many years  
Love that's filled my ears  
I got to thank you Lord for giving us Pure Smokey  
And anyone who hears - hears that voice so free  
He really got a hold on me  
And I thank you all for giving to us Smokey - Smokey  
  
Singing it so sweetly  
Like no one else could do  
Always trying something new  
I thank you all for giving us Pure Smokey

I get rattled every time we meet  
I get rattled even in my sleep  
I get rattled, baby, over you  
  
I get twisted, I get turned around  
I get twisted, and Im up then Im down  
I get twisted, baby, over you  
  
Well, baby, baby, baby wont you save one night for me  
Baby, baby, baby is there something wrong with you  
Baby, baby, baby this is out of my control  
It may look like nothings wrong but deep down in my soul  
Im twisted - shaken - rattled  
I get rattled, baby, over you  
  
Well, baby, baby, baby wont you save one night for me  
Baby, baby, baby is there something wrong with you  
Baby, baby, baby this is out of my control  
It may look like nothings wrong but deep down in my soul  
Im twisted - shaken - rattled  
I get rattled, baby, over you  
  
I get shaken, Im torn up by the roots  
Yeah, Im shakin, way down in my boots  
I get rattled, baby, over you  
I get rattled, baby, over you  
  
Rattled, baby, over you

I'm going down to the river gonna take me my rocking chair  
Going down to the river gonna take me my rocking chair  
And if those blues don't leave me  
Gonna rock on away from here  
  
If you want me woman please don't act so shy  
If you want me woman please don't pass me by  
I love those sideways glances  
Your shoulder and your thigh  
  
I see inside your eyes, the Baba's Sai  
The reasons why I love you  
  
So if you're still busy hiding  
What it is you've got  
If you're frightened of losing  
What you like a lot  
You may be cruisin' backwards  
While thinking that you're not  
  
I see into your eyes, the Baba Sais  
The reasons why I love you  
  
So if you don't get the picture  
You won't know what I feel  
If you don't get the picture  
Then you won't have a depth of field  
You may be going someplace  
Someplace you've already been

Gonna write a little letter, mail it to my local dj  
It's a rockin' little record I want my jockey to play  
Roll over beethoven, I hear it again today  
You know my temperature's rising and the juke-box blows a fuse  
My heart's beatin' rhythm and my soul is a-singing the blues  
Roll over beethoven and tell tchaikowsky the news  
I got a rockin' pneumonia, I need a shot of rhythm and blues  
I think I got it off the writer sittin' down at the rhythm review  
Roll over beethoven, we're rockin' by two by two  
Well, if you feel you like it  
Well get your lover and reel and rock it  
Roll it over and move on up just  
A little bit further and reel and rock it, roll it over  
Roll over beethoven, and dig these rhythm and blues  
Early in the morning I'm a-givin' you the warnin'  
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes  
Hey little little gonna play my fiddle, ain't got nothin' to lose  
Roll over beethoven and tell tchaikowsky the news  
You know she winks like a glow worm and dance like a spinnin' top  
She's got a crazy partner, oughta see 'em reel and rock  
Long as she's got a dime, the music will never stop  
Roll over beethoven, roll over beethoven  
Roll over beethoven, roll over beethoven  
Roll over beethoven, dig these rhythm and blues  
(thany you, domo arigato  
Thank you, thank you for coming to see the show  
And I'd like to thank the band and eric for  
Making me come here to japan, it's been very  
Nice and I love you. thank you)  

Everyone has choice  
Whether to or not to raise their voices  
It's you that decides  
Which way you will turn  
While feeling that our love's not your concern  
It's you that decides  
  
No one around you, will carry the blame for you  
No one around you, will love you today  
And throw it all away  
  
Tomorrow when you rise  
Another day for you to realize me  
Or send me down again  
As the days stand up on end  
You've got me wondering how I lost your friendship  
But I see it in your eyes  
  
Though I'm beside you I can't carry the lame for you  
I may decide to get out with your blessing  
Where I'll carry on guessing  
  
How high will you leap?  
Will you make enough for you to reap it?  
Only you'll arrive  
At your own made end  
With no one but yourself to be offended  
It's you that decides

You fly out as your smile wears thin  
I sigh knowing the mess you're in  
And you know that you can't get away  
And you know that you can't hide it from yourself  
Lonely days, blue guitar  
There's no escape, can only run so far  
  
I know something I ought to say  
Stuck here, trying to find a way  
And you know that you can't get away  
And you know that you can't hide it from yourself  
  
Lonely nights, travelling far  
There's no escape, can only run so far  
Lonesome tears, after dark  
There's no escape, can only run so far  
  
You fly out as your smile wears thin  
I sigh knowing the mess you're in  
And you know that you can't get away  
And you know that you can't hide it from yourself  
  
Lonely days, blue guitar  
There's no escape can only run so far  
Lonely nights, travelling far  
There's no way out, can only run so far  
Lonesome tears, after dark  
There's no escape, can only run so far

Sitting as the noonday sun  
Shines high up in a clear blue sky.  
While warming me I drift away  
No mem'ries of the times gone by.  
Oh, the moment that I lose my mind,  
You come into my heart and say  
I'm always here for you to love,  
Surrender to me, let me stay- ay- ay.  
Oo-oo  
Oo-oo, du, du, du, du, du, du, du.  
  
Sinking deeper still inside,  
I feel awakened from my dreams.  
Resting in some golden flow,  
Becoming part of you it seems.  
  
Nothing separates my life  
From that which we have called our goal,  
It's all in this external world  
As results from deep within my soul-oul-oul.  
Oo-oo  
Oo-oo, du, du, du, du, du, du, du.  
Oo-oo, du, du, du, du, du, du, du.  
  
As I open up my eyes,  
The sky has changed into a glow.  
My sense of time had disappeared,  
I see the sun has sunken low.  
  
I feel such joy and call your name,  
You're ev'rything my eyes could see.  
I'll gladly kiss it all goodbye,  
Stay ever in your company-ny-ny.  
Oo-oo  
Oo-oo, du, du, du, du, du, du, du.  
Oo-oo, sri krishna,  
Du, du, du, du, du, du, du.  
Sat singing.  
Sat, sat.

It's easier to tell a lie than it is to tell the truth  
It's easier to kill a fly than it is to turn it loose  
It's easier to criticize somebody else  
Than to see yourself  
  
It's easier to give a sigh and be like all the rest  
Who stand around and crucify you while you do your best  
It's easier to see the books upon the shelf  
Than to see yourself  
  
It's easier to hurt someone and make them cry  
Than it is to dry their eyes  
I got tired of fooling around with other people's lies  
Rather I'd find someone that's true  
  
It's easier to say you won't than it is to feel you can  
It's easier to drag your feet than it is to be a man  
It's easier to look at someone eles's wealth  
Than to see yourself

I can't understand how I've gone astray  
I should be sailing away on a liner  
I was knocked on my back on a dock at Yangtse  
It's a hell of a way to see China but I'm ready  
You must be crazy  
And you got no money  
And you're a liar  
My straits are dire from the, the wok into the fire  
I'd like to trust you but I've broken my rickshaw  
Sometimes there's no hope in, in chasing opium  
I'd like to love you but I'm not sure what's in your eyes  
Mm, Shanghai surprise  
Whatever you're saying, I want it anyway in  
Been hanging 'round like a kid at your back door  
(Ooh, babe)  
You could be kinder, and show me Asia minor  
I'll let you love me, let you see what's here in my eyes  
Shanghai surprise  
You must be crazy  
(Crazy)  
And you got no money  
(Money)  
And it seems like madness  
Back streets so crowded that no room to swing a cat  
I'd like to know you but you're acting so coolie  
I'm finding out pursued by evil looking dudes it's  
Getting hot for me like tofu when it deep fries  
Oh, Shanghai surprise  
But baby you look like any common crook  
That's hanging 'round in those real shady places  
(Ooh, babe)  
While you assess me, why not try to impress me?  
Step over here, let me see what's there in your eyes  
Oh, Shanghai surprise  
I don't understand how I got delayed  
I should be sailing today on a liner  
Was kicked in the ass on a dock at Yangtse  
It's no way for a man to see China but I'm ready  
You must be crazy  
(Crazy)  
And you got no money  
(Money)  
But you're a trier  
My straits are dire from the, the wok into the fire  
I'd like to meet you but I've broken my chopstick  
Sometimes there's no hope in, in chasing promises  
I wanna love you though it could prove to be unwise  
Shanghai surprise  
Whatever you're saying, I want it anyway in  
Been hanging 'round for a ride on your rickshaw  
(Ooh, babe)  
You may correct me, now that you've inspected me  
Come over here, let me feel you cut down to size  
Oh, Shanghai surprise  
My straits are dire from the, the wok into the fire  
I'd like to know you but I'm not really social  
Sometimes it's no joke, can't cope with opium  
I'd like to love you but I'm not sure what's in your eyes  
Shanghai surprise  
Shanghai surprise, Shanghai surprise  
And you got no money  
But you're a trier  

Now the winter has come  
To eclipse out the sun  
That has lighted my love for sometime  
And a cold wind now blows  
  
Not much tenderness flows  
From the heart of someone feeling so tired  
And he feels so alone  
With no love of his own  
So sad, so bad, so sad, so bad  
  
While his memory raced  
With much speed and great haste  
Through the problems of being there  
In his heart at arm's length  
  
Held within its great strength  
To ward off such a great despair  
But he feels so alone  
With no love of his own  
So sad, so bad, so sad, so bad  
  
Take the dawn of the day  
And give it away  
To someone who can fill the part  
Of the dream we once held  
  
Now it's got to be shelved  
It's too late to make a new start  
And he feels so alone  
With no love of his own  
So sad, so bad, so sad, so bad

I ate it and at once my eyes could see you  
No sooner had I ooped it down  
I felt so far off from the ground I stood on  
My legs seemed to me like high-rise buildings  
My head was high up in the sky  
My skin the sun began to fry like bacon  
And then somebody old appeared and asked had I come far  
And hadn't they just seen me up on Haleakala  
I kept on body surfing to pretend I hadn't heard  
There was someone there beside me, swimming like Richard III  
And I'm still smiling  
Seven naked native girls swam seven sacred pools  
Lone-ranger smoking doobies said you're breaking all the rules  
Better get your clothes on or else there'll be a row  
If it wasn't for my sunstroke I would take you on right now  
And I'm still smiling  
I fell in love with my soft-hearted Hana  
She entered right in through my heart  
And now although we're miles apart  
I still feel her  
She lives beneath the crater in the meadow  
She moves among the fruit and grain  
You can meet her after heavy rain has fallen  

You're a soft touch baby  
Like a snowflake falling  
My whole heart is melting  
As a warm sun rises  
Into joy, I'm sailing  
To your soft touch baby  
Eyes that shine from depths of your soul  
Fixed by their charm, take my control  
Love so sweet as the ocean is wide  
Caught by your waves and drawn to your side  
As a cool wind blows me  
All the treetops whisper  
To your soft touch baby  
As a new moon rises  
Those ideas of Heaven  
Fall in your soft touch, baby  
Eyes that shine from depths of your soul  
Fixed by their charm, take my control  
Love so sweet as the ocean is wide  
Caught by your waves and drawn to your side  
You're a soft touch baby  
Like a snowflake falling  
My whole heart is melting  
As a warm sun rises  
Into joy I'm sailing  
To your soft touch baby  
You're a soft touch baby  
Yes, I love that soft touch  
Hmm, that soft touch  
You're a soft touch baby  
Yes, I love that soft touch  

You got into my life  
I don't know how you found me, but you did  
It stopped me heading someplace else  
  
Took me a while to say  
Wish you belong to me  
But now I'm saddened like I've never been  
Regretting that we'll leave  
  
And for a while you could comfort me  
And hold me for some time  
I need you now to be beside me  
While all my world is so untidy  
  
Loneliness (oh-o-oh)  
Empty faces (oh-o-oh)  
Wish I could leave them all (o-oh)  
In someplace else  
  
(Someplace else)  
  
I hope you won't let go  
Maybe you'll let me know  
That you'll be saddened like you've never been  
Regretting that we'll leave  
  
And for a while I could comfort you  
And hold you in my mind  
I need you now to be beside me  
While all my world is sad and crazy  
  
Loneliness (oh-o-oh)  
Empty faces (oh-o-oh)  
Wish I could leave them all (o-oh)  
In someplace else  
  
And for a while you could comfort me  
And hold me for some time  
I need you now to be beside me  
While all my world is so untidy  
  
Loneliness (oh-o-oh)  
Empty faces (oh-o-oh)  
Wish I could leave them all (o-oh)  
In someplace else  
  
Loneliness (oh-o-oh)  
Empty faces (oh-o-oh)  
Wish I could leave them all (o-oh)  
In someplace else  
  
(Someplace else)  
  
I think I'm gonna leave them all  
In someplace else

Something in the way she moves  
Attracts me like no other lover  
Something in the way she woos me  
  
I don't want to leave her now  
You know I believe and how  
  
Somewhere in the way she smiles  
That I don't need no other lover  
Something in her style that shows me  
  
I don't want to leave her now  
You know I believe and how  
  
You're asking me will my love grow  
I don't know, I don't know  
You stick around and it may show  
I don't know, I don't know  
  
Something in the way she knows  
All I have to do is think of her  
Something in the things she shows me  
  
I don't want to leave her now  
You know I believe and how

Never slept so little  
Never smoked so much  
Lost my concentration I could even lose my touch  
Talking to myself  
Crying out loud  
Only I can hear me  
I'm stuck inside a cloud  
  
I made some exhibition  
I lost my will to eat  
The only thing that matters to me is to touch your lotus feet  
Talking to myself  
Crying out loud  
  
Only I can hear me  
I'm stuck inside a cloud  
Talking to myself  
Crying out loud  
Only I can hear me  
And I'm stuck inside a cloud  
  
Talking to myself  
Crying out loud  
Only I can hear me  
I'm stuck inside a cloud  
  
Never been so crazy  
But I've never felt so sure  
I wish I had the answer to give  
Don't even have the cure  
  
Just talking to myself crying as we part  
Knowing as you leave me  
I also lose my heart  
Talking to myself crying as we part  
Knowing as you leave me  
I also lose my heart

It's sunshine life for me  
If I could get away from this cloud over me  
Seems to just follow me around  
  
There's a good life had for free  
When you're out in the country  
That's what I could use  
If I could get away there soon  
  
It's a sunshine life for me  
If I could get away from this cloud over me  
Seems to just follow me around  
  
There's a good life had at sea  
If you're not in the navy  
That's the life for you  
Sail away raymond, sail away  
  
Now most folks just bore me  
Always imposing, and I'd rather meet a tree  
Somewhere out in the cornfield  
  
And it's a sunshine. ..  
It's a sunshine life for me  
If I could get away from this cloud over me  
Seems to just follow me around

Let me tell you how it will be  
There's one for you, nineteen for me  
'Cause I'm the taxman, yeah, I'm the taxman  
  
Should five per cent appear too small  
Be thankful I don't take it all  
'Cause I'm the taxman, yeah I'm the taxman  
  
If you drive a car, I'll tax the street,  
If you try to sit, I'll tax your seat.  
If you get too cold I'll tax the heat,  
If you take a walk, I'll tax your feet.  
  
Don't ask me what I want it for  
If you don't want to pay some more  
'Cause I'm the taxman, yeah, I'm the taxman  
  
Now my advice for those who die  
Declare the pennies on your eyes  
'Cause I'm the taxman, yeah, I'm the taxman  
And you're working for no one but me.

Teardrops - I've had my share of crying buckets  
full of  
Teardrops - so hard to take - I got a soaking  
with those  
Teardrops - and it feels like I have taken over from  
the rain.  
  
In the heart of the lonely man  
In and out of love more often where most others can  
He walks the streets like the losers in some  
lovers game  
He talks so sweet but the news is always much  
the same.  
  
Teardrops - I've had my share of crying buckets  
full of  
Teardrops - so hard to take - I got a soaking  
with those  
Teardrops - and it feels like I have taken over from  
the rain.  
  
In the eyes of the lonely one  
Everything is cold and hopeless that he looks  
upon  
He needs a friend a lover who can comfort him  
His deeds offend he knows that he has brought  
on him.  
  
Teardrops - I've had my share of crying buckets

He's fighting the forces of darkness limitation  
Falsehood and mortality which bar him  
The way back into the higher world  
While his whole being is bewildered  
He does not know no law of action  
Taking refuge inside himself and he's saying  
  
I need someone to show me  
Illumine my consciousness  
Remove the dark from in me  
And give me that which I have lost  
  
As all had seemed lost a light from Heaven  
Breaking  
A flash inward illumination  
Enriched his life more than any words can tell  
He stood there, life renewed fresh as rain  
Scales were falling from his eyes again  
The bolts of his prison opening he's saying  
  
I found someone who showed me  
Illumined my consciousness  
Removed the dark from in me  
And given me that which I have lost  
  
You people don't have time to listen to him  
You're too busy fighting revolutions  
That keep you back down in the lower world  
Your mirrors of understanding they need  
Cleansing  
Polish away the dust of desire  
Before pure light will reflect in them  
  
You need someone to show you  
Illumine your consciousness  
Remove the dark from in you  
And give you that which you have lost.

The day the world gets 'round  
to understanding where it is,  
Using all it's found,  
to help each other, hand in hand  
  
The day the world gets 'round  
to understanding where it's gone  
Losing so much ground  
killing each other, hand in hand  
Such foolishness in man  
I want no part of their plan - OH NO  
  
If you're the destructive kind  
Now I'm working from day to day  
As I don't want to be like you  
I look for the pure of heart  
And the ones that have made a start,  
  
But Lord, there are just a few  
who bow before you,  
in silence they pray,  
  
Oh how they pray for the day the  
world gets 'round  
  
Using all they've found  
To help each other, hand in hand  
  
The Day The World Gets 'Round

Without going out of my door,  
I can know all things on earth  
without looking out of my window,  
I can know the ways of heaven.  
The farther one travels  
the less one knows  
the less one really knows.  
Without going out of your door,  
You can know all things on earth  
without looking out of your window,  
you can know the ways of heaven.  
The farther one travels  
the less one knows  
the less one really knows.  
Arrive without travelling,  
See all without looking,  
Do all without doing.

I've heard how some people, have said  
That I've changed  
That I'm not what I was  
How it really is a shame  
The thoughts in their heads,  
Manifest on their brow  
Like bad scars from ill feelings  
They themselves arouse  
So hateful of anyone that is happy  
Or 'free'  
They live all their lives,  
Without looking to see  
The light that has lighted the world  
It's funny how people, just won't  
Accept change  
As if nature itself - they'd prefer  
Re-arranged  
So hard to move on  
When you're down in a hole  
Where there's so little chance,  
To experience soul  
I'm grateful to anyone,  
That is happy or 'free'  
For giving me hope  
While I'm looking to see  
The light that has lighted the world  

The lord loves the one that loves  
The lord  
And the law says if you don't give,  
Then you don't get loving  
  
Now the lord helps those that help  
Themselves  
And the law says whatever you do  
Is going to come right back on you  
  
We all making out  
Like we own this whole world  
While the leaders of nations  
They're acting like big girls  
With no thoughts for their god  
Who provides us with all  
But when death comes to claim them  
Who will stand,  
And who will fall?  
  
The lord loves the one that loves  
The lord  
And the law says if you don't give,  
Then you don't get loving  
  
Now the lord helps those that help  
Themselves  
And the law says whatever you do  
Is going to come right back on you  
  
We all move around,  
With objectives in mind,  
To become rich or famous,  
With our reputations signed,  
But the few that can reach,  
To this coveted slot,  
Don't escape old age creeping,  
Through their bodies,  
Like a rot  
  
While the lord loves the one that loves  
The lord  
And the law says if you don't give,  
Then you don't get loving  
Now the lord helps those that help  
Themselves  
And the law says whatever you do  
Is going to come right back on you

I've got a word or two  
To say about the things that you do  
Youre telling all those lies  
About the good things that  
We can have if we close our eyes  
  
Do what you want to do  
And go where you're going to  
Think for yourself  
Cause I wont be there with you  
  
I left you far behind  
The ruins of the life that you have in mind  
And though you still can't see  
I know your minds made up  
Youre gonna cause more misery  
  
Do what you want to do  
And go where you're going to  
Think for yourself  
Cause I wont be there with you  
  
Although your minds opaque  
Try thinking more if just for your own sake  
The future still looks good  
And youve got time to rectify  
All the things that you should  
  
Do what you want to do  
And go where you're going to  
Think for yourself  
Cause I wont be there with you  
  
Do what you want to do  
And go where you're going to  
Think for yourself  
Cause I wont be there with you  
  
Think for yourself  
Cause I wont be there with you

(one, two, three, four)  
  
Found myself out on a limb  
But I'm happier than I've ever been  
But this guitar can't keep from crying  
  
Learned to get up when I fall  
Can even climb rolling stone walls  
But this guitar can't keep from crying  
  
This here guitar can feel quite sad  
Can be high strung, sometimes get mad  
Can't understand or deal with hate  
Responds much better to love  
  
I though by now you knew the score  
But you missed the point just like before  
And this guitar can't keep from crying  
  
(this) guitar, it can't keep from crying  
This guitar can't keep from crying  
  
This here guitar can feel quite sad  
Can be high strung, sometimes get mad  
It can't understand or deal with hate  
Responds much better to love  
  
While you attack, create offence  
I'll put it down to your ignorance  
But this guitar it can't keep from crying  
This guitar can't keep from crying  
  
This guitar can't keep from crying  
This guitar can't keep from crying

The sun came into view  
As I sat with the tears in my eyes  
The sun came up on you  
And as you smiled, the teardrop, it dried  
  
I don't know where I had been  
But I know what I have seen  
Made me chill right to the bone  
Made me wish that I'd stayed home along with you  
  
Tired of midnight blues  
  
The sun came up so high  
And as it shone, I realized your love  
The sun shone in your eyes  
And as you smiled, you realized it too  
  
Don't know where I had been  
But I know what I have seen  
Made me chill right to the bone  
Made me wish that I'd stayed home with you  
  
Tired of midnight blues  
  
Don't know where I had been  
But I know what I have seen  
Made me chill right to the bone  
Made me wish that I'd stayed home with you  
  
Tired of midnight blues  
  
The sun went down the sky  
Way up the clouds told me that they knew  
The moon came up so high  
And as you smiled, I knew that you knew too  
  
Don't know where I had been  
But I know what I have seen  
Made me chill right to the bone  
Made me wish that I'd stayed home with you  
  
Tired of midnight blues  
  
I don't know where I had been  
But I know what I have seen  
Made me chill right to the bone  
Made me wish that I'd stayed home with you

Way back in time  
Someone said try some  
I tried some  
Now buy some, I bought some  
Oh Oh Oh  
After a while  
When I had tried them  
Denied them  
I opened my eyes and  
I saw you  
  
Not a thing did I have  
Not a thing did I see  
'Till I called on your love  
And your love came to me  
  
OH OH OH OH OH OH  
  
Through my life  
I've seen gray sky,  
Met big fry,  
Seen them die to get high  
Oh Oh Oh  
And when it seemed that I would  
Always be lonely  
I opened my eyes and I saw you  
  
Not a thing did I feel  
Not a thing did I know  
'Till I called on your love  
And your love sure did grow  
  
OH OH OH OH OH OH  
  
Won't you try some  
Baby won't you buy some  
  
Won't you try some  
Baby won't you buy some

Wah-wah  
You've given me a wah-wah  
And I'm thinking of you  
And all the things that we used to do  
Wah-wah, wah-wah  
Wah-wah  
You made me such a big star  
Being there at the right time  
Cheaper than a dime  
Wah-wah, you've given me your  
Wah-wah, wah-wah  
Oh, you don't see me crying  
Oh, you don't hear me sighing  
Wah-wah  
I don't need no wah-wah  
And I know how sweet life can be  
If I keep myself free, wah-wah  
I don't need no wah-wah  
Oh, you don't see me crying  
Hey baby, you don't hear me sighing  
Oh, no, no, no, no  
Wah-wah  
Now I don't need no wah-wahs  
And I know how sweet life can be  
If I keep myself free of wah-wah  
I don't need no wah-wah  
Wah-wah, wah-wah, wah-wah  
Wah-wah, wah-wah, wah-wah  
Wah-wah, wah-wah

One! Two!  
Back then long time ago when grass was green  
Woke up in a daze  
Arrived like strangers in the night  
(Fab! Doot, doot, doot doo)  
Long time ago when we was fab (Fab!)  
Back when income tax was all we had  
Caressers fleeced you in the morning light  
Casualties at dawn  
And we did it all  
(Fab! Doot, doot, doot doo)  
Long time ago when we was fab (Fab)  
In my world you are my only love  
  
And while you're in this world  
The fuzz gonna come and claim you  
But you mo better wise  
When the buzz gonna come and take you away  
Take you away. Take you away  
  
The microscopes that magnified the tears  
Studied warts and all  
Still the life flowed on and on  
(Fab! Doot, doot, doot, Gear!)  
Long time ago when we was fab (Fab)  
  
But it's all over now, baby blue  
(Oo! doot, doot doot. Fab!)  
Long time ago when we was fab  
(Fab!) Like this pullover you sent me  
(Fab! Doot, doot, doot. Gear!)  
And you really got a hold on me  
(Fab! Doot, doot, doot, Gear!)  

Where were you last night?  
You were so uptight  
What did you do, who did you see?  
Were you with someone  
Who reminded you of me?  
  
Where were you last night?  
  
Where were you last week?  
Were you up a creek?  
Did you stay up pacing the floor?  
Got me worried  
You ignore me more and more  
  
Where were you last night?  
You werent around me  
When they found me  
Where were you last night?  
  
Youd better stop your messin around  
Your name is going round from town to town  
Its making me sad  
Making me feel bad  
Where were you last night?  
  
Where were you last year?  
Youre sure as [...]  
You werent waiting where you said  
You sent someone in your place instead  
  
Where were you last night?  
Its getting to me  
Making me gloomy  
Where were you last night?

I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping  
While my guitar gently weeps  
I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping  
Still my guitar gently weeps  
I don't know how nobody told you how to unfold your love  
I don't know how someone controlled you  
They bought and sold you  
I look at the world and I notice it's turning  
While my guitar gently weeps  
With every mistake we must surely be learning  
Still my guitar gently weeps  
  
I don't know how you were diverted  
You were perverted too  
I don't know how you were inverted  
No one alerted you.  
  
I look at you all I see the love there that's sleeping  
While my guitar gently weeps  
Look at you all  
Still my guitar gently weeps

I've been held up,  
I've been run down  
I can see quite clearly now  
Through those past years,  
When I played towing the line.  
I only ask, that what I feel,  
Should not be denied me now,  
As it's been earned, and  
I have seen my life belongs to me  
My love belongs to who can see it  
  
I've lived in fear,  
I've been out there,  
I've been 'round and  
Seen my share  
Of this sad world  
And all the hate,  
That it's stirred  
I only ask,  
That what I know,  
Should not be denied me now  
As it's been learned,  
And I have seen my life belongs to me  
My love belongs to who can see it  
  
I only ask, that what I feel,  
Should not be denied me now  
As it's been earned, and  
I have seen my life belongs to me  
  
My love belongs to who can see it.  
  
My love belongs to who

I'm gonna leave you here  
I'm gonna leave you at the station  
I've got a long way to go baby  
Woman don't you cry for me  
  
Now I can't take no more  
Now I don't need no complication  
I've got a long way to go baby  
Woman don't you cry for me  
  
There's no one place I want to be  
Attachment only hurts you  
Take care of yourself baby  
C'mon won't you let me be  
  
There's just one thing I got to see  
That's the Lord got to keep him in sight  
Take care of yourself baby  
C'mon won't you let me be  
  
There's no one place I want to be  
Attachment only hurts you  
Better take care of yourself baby  
C'mon won't you try to see  
  
There is just one thing I got to see  
That's the Lord got to keep him in sight  
Take care of yourself baby  
C'mon won't you let me be  
  
Now baby here's the door  
I don't need no aggravation  
I've got a long way to go baby  
Woman don't you cry for me  
  
I'm gonna leave you here  
I'm gonna leave you at the station  
I've got a long way to go baby  
Woman don't you cry for me  
  
I've got a long way to go baby  
Woman don't you cry for me

Wise man, you wont be  
To follow the like of me  
In this world made of stone  
Such a long way to go  
  
We may disagree  
We all have the right to be  
In this world made of stone  
Such a long way to go  
Such a long, long way from home  
  
And we may disagree  
We all have the right to be  
In this world made out of stone  
Its such a long, long way to go  
  
The wiser you may be  
The harder it can be to see  
In this world made of stone  
Such a long, long way to go  
Such a long way from home  
  
In this world made of stone  
Such a long, long way to go  
And such a long way from om

I'm not the wreck of the Hesperus  
Feel more like the Wall of China  
Getting old as Methuselah  
Feel tall as the Eiffel Tower  
I'm not a power of attorney  
But I can rock as good as Gibraltar  
Ain't no more no spring chicken  
Been plucked but I'm still kicking  
But it's alright, it's alright  
  
Poison penmen sneak, have no nerve to speak  
Make up lies then they leak 'm out  
Behind a pseudonym, the rottenness in them  
Reaching out trying to touch me  
  
Met some Oscars and Tonys  
I slipped on a pavement oyster  
Met a snake climbing ladders  
Got out of the line of fire  
(But it's alright)  
  
Brainless writers gossip nonsenses  
To others heads as dense as they is  
It's the same old malady  
What they see is faulty  
  
I'm not the wreck of the Hesperus  
Feel more like Big Bill Broonzy  
Getting old as my mother  
But I tell you I got some company  
(But it's alright)  
  
But it's alright, it's alright  
But it's alright, it's alright  
It's alright, alright  
It's alright

The writing's on the wall brother  
Your life is in your hands  
It's up to you to see the writing's on the wall.  
  
It looks you in the eye mister  
It's time we stand up tall  
Go see and understand the writing's on the wall.  
  
Strange we hold on to things that have no grace  
Or power  
While death holds on to us much more with every  
Passing hour  
And all the time you thought it would last  
Your life, your friends would always be  
'Til they're drunk away or shot away or die away  
From you.  
  
There's nothing that you need sister  
The Lord is in you all  
Life is designed to see the writing's on the wall.  
  
The music's in the air mothers  
You may have heard it call  
To you that you may see the writing's on the wall.  
  
Be careful going home sister  
Be watchful down that road  
You've got a lot of love sister  
More to grow.  
  
The writing's on the wall brothers  
Your life is in your hands  
It's up to you to see the writing's on the wall  
I hope that you may see the writing's on the wal

You took my breath away  
I want it back again  
Look at the mess I'm in  
I don't know what to say  
I don't know how to feel  
You don't care anyway  
All I can do is wait  
You took my breath away  
  
You took this song of mine  
And changed the middle bit  
It used to sound alright  
But now the words don't fit  
Its getting hard to rhyme  
Impossible to play  
I've tried it many times  
You took my breath away  
  
One day when the sun is shining  
There will be that silver lining  
  
You knocked my headlights out  
So turn them on again  
I can't see where I'm going  
I can't tell where I've been  
I don't know how to feel  
This hasnt been my day  
Seems like I've lost a wheel  
You took my breath away  
  
You took my breath away  
You took my breath away  
You took my breath away

Sublime in the summertime, warm and lazy. . .  
These are perfect days like Heaven's about here  
But unlike summer came and went  
Your love is forever  
I feel it and my heart knows  
That we share it together  
  
Resigned to the wintertime's cold and dreary  
Peering into fire flames, burning I know  
That unlike winter came and went  
Your love is forever  
I feel it and my heart knows  
That we share it together  
  
I feel it and my heart knows you're the one  
The guiding light in all your love shines on  
The only lover worth it all  
Your love is forever
