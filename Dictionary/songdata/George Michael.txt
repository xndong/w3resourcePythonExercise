It's late, time for bed  
So we sit, and I wait  
For that gin and tonic  
To go to your head  
I know it's a devious plan  
But it's the only way that I know  
To get those big bad car keys  
Out of your hand  
You know that I remain a gentle man  
But even so there's only so much a gentleman can stand  
Sleep with me  
Oh, sleep with me tonight  
My cards are on your table  
My dreams are in your bed  
If I was able, I'd be there instead  
Oh oh, sleep with me tonight  

Hey this won't take much time  
We won't touch, we'll just wait for signs  
And nothing was further from my mind  
Than this moment with you  
  
But if you'd only told me baby  
I would have made some other plans  
If I'd only seen it sooner  
But what a way with your hands you had  
I wanted that moment with you  
  
I know that is wrong  
But "if you need me, I'm here", turns me on  
I can't help thinking it's a miracle you're here  
I can't help thinking it's a miracle  
  
Say, you don't waste much time  
We don't touch, do we baby?  
But still my hands are tied  
For that moment with you  
  
But if you'd only told me baby  
I would have made some other plans  
If I'd only seen it sooner  
But what a way with your hands you had  
I wanted that moment with you  
  
You know that I'm strong  
And I've no reason to fear, am I wrong?  
I can't help thinking it's a miracle you're here  
I can't help thinking it's a miracle  
I can't help thinking it's a miracle  
I can't help thinking it's a miracle  
I can't help thinking it's a miracle you're here  
  
You can't keep holding it in when it's something good  
(Get up, get up)  
You can't keep holding it in when it's something good  
(Get up, get up)  
  
And who can you trust?  
Dealing out justice with a minimum of fuss  
Who baby  
Dealing out justice...

I was mixed up when you came to me  
Too broke to fix said 'daddy you gone, I'm missing my baby'  
Still missing my baby  
  
I was stitched up by the hands of fate  
Said how you gonna make it on your own if luck is a lady?  
Maybe luck is a lady  
  
I was going down for the third time  
My heart was broken, I was not open to your suggestions  
I had so many questions  
That you just kissed away  
  
Tell me, I guess that cupid was in disguise  
The day you walked in and changed my life  
I think it's amazing  
The way that love can you set you free  
  
So now I walk in the midday sun  
I never thought that my savior would come  
I think it's amazing  
I think it's amazing  
  
I think you're amazing  
  
You tried to save me from myself  
Said 'darling, kiss as many as you want!  
My love's still available  
And I now you're insatiable'  
  
We're like victims of the same disease  
Look at your big bad daddy and your mom  
And your mom, was always acting crazy  
  
I was going down for the third time  
My heart was broken, I though that loving you was out of the  
  
Question  
Then I say my reflection  
Saying please don't let this go  
  
Tell me, I guess that cupid was in disguise  
The day you walked in and changed my life  
I think it's amazing  
The way that love can you set you free  
  
So now I walk in the midday sun  
I never thought that my savior would come  
I think it's amazing  
I think you're amazing  
  
Celebrate the love of the one you're with  
  
Celebrate, this life with you baby  
I think you should celebrate yeah  
Don't put your love in chains baby  
No no, walk in the midday sun  
I thought I was dreaming  
I think it's amazing  
I think you're amazing  
  
I said celebrate the love of the one you're with  
  
As this life gets colder  
And the devil inside  
Tells you to give up

Bless the day you came into my life, I still remember  
Horny cowboy with your stars and stripes  
Bringing the light into my day  
With that Texan smile  
  
Too afraid to love, to hope that you would stay  
So broken that I never saw you chase the past away  
  
My American Angel, he doesn't want to fight (doesn't need to fight)  
My U.S of Angel, holds me in the dead of night  
Takes away that fear that I carried forever  
You stopped to wipe away my tears  
And you stayed forever and more  
  
(I don't think that I)  
  
Yesterday it seemed my life was colder than December  
All alone I watched the eagles fly  
Even the light seemed to have changed  
In the Californian sky  
  
Through all of those battles then you came  
Stepped out of the fading light  
Said, "Baby I'm American, dry your eyes again,  
Because I'm here to save your life"  
  
My American Angel, he doesn't want to fight (doesn't need to fight)  
My U.S of Angel, holds me in the dead of night  
Takes away that fear that I carried forever  
You stopped to wipe away my tears  
But you stayed forever amore  
  
And more, didn't you baby  
  
Because I don't think that I could love and lose again  
I don't think I have the strength  
I don't think I have the strength  
  
I don't think that I

As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving  
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early May  
Just as hate knows love's the cure  
You can rest your mind assured  
That I'll be loving you always  
  
As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow  
But in passing will grow older every day  
Just as all is born is new  
Do you know what I say is true?  
That I'll be loving you always  
  
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky  
Until the ocean covers every mountain high  
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four  
Until the day is the day that are no more  
  
Did you know that true love asks for nothing?  
Her acceptance is the way we pay  
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee  
To last through forever and another day?  
  
As today I know I'm living, but tomorrow  
Could make me the past  
But that I mustn't fear  
I know deep in my mind  
The love of me I've left behind  
'Cause I'll be loving you always  
  
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky  
Until the ocean covers every mountain high  
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea  
Until we dream of life, and life becomes a dream  
Until the day is night, and night becomes the day  
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away  
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four  
Until the day that is the day that are no more  
  
Did you know that true love asks for nothing?  
Her acceptance is the way we pay  
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee  
To last through forever and another day?  
  
As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving  
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early May  
For now I know deep in my mind  
The love of me I've left behind  
'Cause I'll be loving you always  
  
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky  
Until the ocean covers every mountain high  
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea  
Until we dream of life, and life becomes a dream  
  
Until the day is night, and night becomes the day  
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away  
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four  
Until the day that is the day that are no more

Woo-woo  
Dear mummy, dear daddy,  
You had plans forme, I was your only son.  
And long before this baby boy could count to three,  
You knew just what he would become.  
Run along to school,  
No child of mine grows up a fool,  
Run along to school.  
When you tried to tell me what to do,  
I just shut my mouth and smiled at you,  
One thing that I know for sure-  
  
Bad boys  
Stick together, never sad boys  
Good guys  
They made rules for fools, so get wise...  
  
Dear mummy, dear daddy,  
Now I'm nineteen as you see,  
I'm handsome, tall, and strong.  
So what the hell gives you the right to look at me,  
As if to say "hell, what went wrong? "  
Where were you last night?  
You look as if you had a fight.  
Where were you last night?  
Well I think that you may just be right,  
But don't try to keep me in tonight,  
Because I'm big enough to break down the door.  
  
Bad boys  
Stick together, never sad boys  
Good guys  
They made rules for fools, so get wise...  
  
Boys like you, are bad through and through.  
Still, girls like me, always seem to be with you....  
We can't help but worry,  
You're in such a hurry,  
Mixing with the wrong boys,  
Playing with the wrong toys.  
Easy girls,  
And late nights,  
Cigarettes, and love bites  
Why do you have to be so cruel?  
You're such a fool  
  
Bad boys  
Stick together, never sad boys  
Good guys  
They made rules for fools, so get wise...

You ask too much of me  
You try my patience  
Your tongue - it's like a razor  
You choose your words like weapons  
Here we go - battlestations  
  
I never have the guts to let you look inside  
I don't think you'd appreciate the things that I hide  
  
Chorus:  
Monday was the worst day  
And friday wasn't my day  
But wednesday was the best day  
Because on wednesday night we made love  
All I'm trying to give you is a good time honey  
Why d'ya have to keep on playing games with my head  
Used to be your baby when you had no money  
Now we spend more time in battle  
Than we ever do in bed  
(than we ever do in bed)  
  
You don't know how much I hate that answer phone  
Are you standing there?  
But - you won't pick up the 'phone  
Why lie to my face?  
(when you can buy a tape machine to give me bullshit in your place)  
  
Today I did something I thought I'd never do  
I opened up your diary and read about you  
  
Chorus  
  
Monday was the worst day  
Wednesday we made love  
And friday - ooh but -  
Saturday, is today, is what I'm thinking of  
Come in baby- come in close  
(take off your designer clothes)  
Cause you know what I'm thinking of  
Do you remember me, do you remember us -  
Do you remember love?  
  
All I'm trying to give you is a good time honey  
Why d'ya have to keep on playing games with my head  
Used to be your baby when you had no money  
Now we spend more time in battle  
Than we ever do in bed  
(than we ever do in bed)  
  
La premiere fois tu m'as fait beaucoup rire  
Tu etais si mignon, et tu jouais du piano  
Maintenant, mon mellieur ami c'est l'argent  
Au revoir, cheri  
Au revoir, mon amour

Where has my love gone?  
How can I go on?  
It seems dear love has gone away.  
Where is my spirit?  
I'm nowhere near it,  
Oh yes, my love has gone astray.  
But Ill blame it on the sun,  
The sun that didn't shine,  
Ill blame it on the wind and the trees.  
Ill blame it on the time that never was enough,  
Ill blame it on the tide and the sea,  
But, my heart blames it on me.  
Who poured the love out?  
What made this bitter doubt?  
Is peace not here for me to see?  
Wish I could tell you,  
But, words won't come for me to speak.  
But Ill blame it on the sun,  
That didn't fill the sky,  
Ill blame it on the birds and the trees.  
Ill blame it on the day that ended once too soon,  
Ill blame it on the nights that could not be,  
But, my heart blames it on me.  
(background)...yeh, yeh, yeh, ooh,  
Your heart blames it on you this time.  
  

Every day it seems my smile's a little harder  
And every day, I seem to laugh a little less  
Living this way, it seems my sky's a little darker  
You went away and left me lonely in success  
  
(can't you see I'm falling apart) (repeat)  
  
Can't you see what's happenin' to me  
  
Take this hand and show my fingers where my heart is  
Understand, you may just save me from despair  
Watch this man, you'll see he can't stop what he has started  
Take this hand, you'll see right now there's no-one there  
  
(can't you see I'm falling apart)  
You laugh at me as I fall  
(can't you see I'm falling apart)  
Just tell me, tell me, give me one good reason  
  
Armed with love, I could save my heart  
But on my own I just can't make it  
I'm too weak to fight, so take it  
Armed with love, I could save my heart  
But instead I watch you die  
  
Armed with love, I could save my heart  
But on my own I just can't make it  
I'm too weak to fight, so take it  
Armed with love, I could save my heart  
Tell me why an I so blue.

once I built a railroad, made it run  
made it race against time  
once I built a rairoad, now it's done  
brother can you spare a dime?  
once I built a tower to the sun  
brick and rivet and lime  
once I built a tower, now it's done  
brother can you spare a dime?  
  
once in khaki suits  
gee, we looked swell  
full of that yankee Doodle De Dum  
half a million boots went slogging through hell  
I was the kid with the drum  
say don't you remember, they called me Al  
It was Al all the time  
say don't you remember, I'm your pal!  
buddy can you spare a dime?

A desert road from Vegas to nowhere  
Someplace better than where you've been  
A coffee machine that needs some fixin'  
In a little cafe just around the bend  
  
I am calling you  
Can't you hear me?  
I am calling you  
(2x)  
  
A desert road from Vegas to nowhere  
Someplace better than where you've been  
A coffee machine that needs some fixin'  
In a little cafe just around the bend  
  
A hot dry wind blows right through me  
The baby's crying and I can't sleep  
Bu we both know a chage is coming  
Come in closer, sweet release  
  
I am calling you  
Can't you hear me?  
I am calling you  
  
Desert road from Vegas to nowhere

I feel so unsure  
As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor  
As the music dies, something in your eyes  
Calls to mind the silver screen  
And all it's sad goodbyes  
  
I'm never gonna dance again  
Guilty feet have got no rhythm  
Though it's easy to pretend  
I know you're not a fool  
  
Should've known better than to cheat a friend  
And waste the chance that I've been given  
So I'm never gonna dance again  
The way I danced with you  
  
Time can never mend  
The careless whispers of a good friend  
To the heart and mind  
Ignorance is kind  
There's no comfort in the truth  
Pain is all you'll find  
  
I'm never gonna dance again  
Guilty feet have got no rhythm  
Though it's easy to pretend  
I know you're not a fool  
  
I should've known better than to cheat a friend  
And waste the chance that I've been given  
So I'm never gonna dance again  
The way I danced with you  
  
Never without your love  
  
Tonight the music seems so loud  
I wish that we could lose this crowd  
Maybe it's better this way  
We'd hurt each other with the things we'd want to say  
  
We could have been so good together  
We could have lived this dance forever  
But now who's gonna dance with me  
Please stay  
  
And I'm never gonna dance again  
Guilty feet have got no rhythm  
Though it's easy to pretend  
I know you're not a fool  
  
Should've known better than to cheat a friend  
And waste the chance that I've been given  
So I'm never gonna dance again  
The way I danced with you  
  
(Now that you're gone) Now that you're gone  
(Now that you're gone) What I did's so wrong, so wrong  
That you had to leave me alone

Let me take you to the place  
Where membership's a smiling face,  
Brush shoulders with the stars.  
Where strangers take you by the hand,  
And welcome you to wonderland -  
From beneath their panamas...  
  
Chorus:  
Club tropicana, drinks are free,  
Fun and sunshine - there's enough for everyone.  
All that's missing is the sea,  
But don't worry, you can suntan!  
  
Castaways and lovers meet,  
Then kiss in tropicana's heat,  
Watch the waves break on the bay.  
Soft white sands, a blue lagoon,  
Cocktail time, a summer's tune,  
A whole night's holiday!  
  
Chorus  
  
Pack your bags,  
And leave tonight.  
Don't take your time,  
Gotta move your feet, don't you miss the flight!  
Cool, cool, cool, cool  
  
Chorus  
  
Cool, cool, cool, cool

Chorus:  
Come on, everybody!  
Get on, with your party!  
And don't let nobody say you're wrong.  
O. K.  
So you've lost control,  
But they'll never steal your soul  
No way!  
That they're gonna spoil your fun.  
  
Greedy men, in far off places,  
Don't be afraid to show your faces.  
We know what you've done is wrong,  
But clap your hands, and sing along now!  
Don't even bother, to let us know,  
When you flick the switch and stop the show,  
Because the party has begun,  
And we'll still be dancing, as-you-run-now!  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh no, don't think that I'm not scared,  
Oh no, don't think that I'm prepared.  
I just take each day as it comes,  
Because it may - it may -,  
It may be the last one!  
I know they don't care about me,  
I ain't got no money, ain't a V. I. P.  
And I know they don't care about you,  
You may - as well - enjoy your life like I do!  
  
Chorus

When your heart's in someone else's hands  
Monkey see and monkey do  
Their wish is your command  
Not to blame  
Everyone's the same  
  
All you do is love and love is all you do  
I should know by now the way I fought for you  
You're not to blame, everyone's the same  
  
I know you think that you're safe  
Mister  
Harmless deception  
That keeps love at bay  
It's the ones who resist that we most want to kiss  
Wouldn't you say?  
  
Cowboys and angels  
They all have the time for you  
Why should I imagine that I'd be a find for you  
Why should I imagine  
That I'd have something to say  
  
But that scar on your face  
That beautiful face of yours  
In your heart there's a trace  
Of someone before  
  
When your heart's in someone else's plans  
Things you say and things you do  
That they don't understand  
You're not to blame  
Always ends the same  
  
You can call it love but I don't think it's true  
You should know by now  
I'm not the boy for you  
You're not to blame  
Always ends the same  
  
I know you think that you're safe  
Sister  
Harmless affection that keeps things this way  
It's the ones who persist for the sake of a kiss  
Who will pay and pay  
Cowboys and angels  
They all have the time for you  
Why should I imagine that I was designed for you  
Why should I believe  
That you would stay  
  
But that scar on your face  
That beautiful face of yours  
Don't you think that I'd know  
They've hurt you, before  
  
Take this man to your place  
Maybe his hands can help you forget  
Please be stronger than your past  
The future may still give you a chance  
The future, the future, not the past  
  
That scar on your face  
That beautiful face of yours  
Don't you think that I know  
They hurt you before

Well I'm still here  
But I'm so scared  
Got myself in trouble, so much trouble  
I know I've got to make it  
But I just can't take New York  
  
My middle name is fear  
I have a vacant stare  
And it's been so long since my body's been warm  
I know I've got to make it  
But I just can't take New York  
  
I came here  
All dreams and wide eyes in the big, big city  
No family, no money  
And I don't even know what's hit me  
  
He hasn't seen a doctor  
Since he got here in the spring  
Went to the Medicentre  
But they wouldn't let him  
Without a green card  
Life can be so hard  
Take pity on a man without a home of his own  
How could he ever have known?  
  
Every street and every corner  
Watch them drowning  
Watch them do the Crazyman dance  
Man and women to the slaughter  
We just stand and watch them  
Do the Crazyman dance  
  
It's been one whole year  
And it's just not fair  
For all the pushing and shoving  
I've still got nothing  
I'm never gonna make it  
And I'm stuck here in New York  
  
So people don't come near  
Unless you've a dollar to spare  
'cause you know what they say  
About madmen on the subways of New York  
Believe it  
  
Yesterday's newspapers  
I wrap them around my body  
Outside these skyscrapers  
I wait for the night to hit me  
And boy, does it hit me  
  
Every street and every corner  
Watch them drowning  
Watch them do the Crazyman dance  
For a nickel or a quarter  
For your pleasure  
Watch them do the Crazyman dance  
  
I'm coming yo London  
I'm coming to Paris  
I'm coming yo make you good clean people embarressed  
Why don't you look at my face  
Why don't you look in my eyes  
You'd rather look at your feet  
You'd rather look at the skies  
  
Oh, you'd look anywhere  
But a man whose pure existence  
Says 'I ain't got time'  
And I don't care  
You just don't care  
Care

When I ask those questions, baby  
It's just to get them out of my head  
Cause they turn around inside it  
Then they spill off to our bed  
Do I really want to know?  
Do I really want to know your life?  
Would I have to let you go?  
Could I listen to my heart if my head stops to think twice?  
  
When I've been a good boy  
When I've been a bad boy  
I have too much fun  
But baby so did everyone  
I've never been an angel  
But things are gonna change, change, change  
So do you really want to know?  
Do you really want to know my life?  
Would you have to let me go?  
Could you listen to your heart if your head stopped to think twice?  
  
If you knew every woman  
And I knew every man  
We never would have made it past holding hands  
I guess the saying is no longer true  
That what you don't know can hurt you  
I guess there is just no question, baby  
You know what you're doing in bed  
If I want your touch  
Should I know too much  
Some things are better left unsaid  
So do I really want to know?  
Do I really want to know your life?  
Would I have to let you go?  
Could I listen to my heart if my head starts to think twice?  
  
(Tell me baby, Cause one thing to guess is one thing to know,  
And don't you think that maybe baby I've got secrets of my own?)  
  
If I knew every woman  
And you knew every man  
We never would have made it past holding hands  
I used to say it but it's no longer true  
Cause what you don't know can really hurt you (Can kill you baby)  
  
And even as we speak  
The world is full of lovers  
Night after night, week after week  
Trusting to luck and a pocket full of rubbers

I would lock you up  
But I could not bear to hear you  
Screaming to be set free  
I would chain you up  
If I'd thought you'd swear  
The only one that mattered was me, me, me  
I would strap you up  
But don't worry baby  
You know I wouldn't hurt you 'less you wanted me to  
  
It's too late to stop  
Won't the heavens save me?  
My daddy said the devil looks a lot like you  
  
You take me to the edge of heaven  
Tell me that my soul's forgiven  
Hide you baby's eyes and we can...  
You take me to the edge of heaven  
One last time might be forever  
When the passion dies -  
It's just a matter of time before my heart is  
Looking for a home  
  
I'm like a maniac, at the end of the day  
I'm like a doggie barking at your door  
So come take me back to the place you stay  
And maybe we can do it once more  
  
You say I'm dangerous  
But don't worry baby  
I get excited at the things that you do  
And there's a place for us in a dirty movie  
Cause no-one does it better than me and you  
  
You take me to the edge of heaven  
Tell me that my soul's forgiven  
Hide your baby's eyes and we can...  
You take me to the edge of heaven  
One last time might be forever  
Please don't tell me lies  
It's just a matter of time before my heart is  
Looking for a home  
  
I ain't got no more worries  
I'm gonna spend some times with you  
Loving you takes such courage  
And don't you think that I know it  
  
You take me to the edge of heaven  
You tell me that my soul's forgiven  
Hide your baby's eyes and we can...  
You take me to the edge of heaven  
One last time might be forever  
Don't you tell me lies, because believe me baby  
One day you'll wake up on your own.  
  
I ain't got no more worries  
I ain't got no more time for you  
Loving you takes such courage  
Everyone's got their eyes on you  
I ain't got no more worries  
I ain't got no more time for you  
Loving you takes such courage  
And don't you think that I know it

Uh huh huh,  
Oh yeah,  
Work, work  
  
Somebody told me,  
"Boy, everything she wants is everything she sees"  
I guess I must have loved you.  
'Cause I said you were the perfect girl for me,  
Maybe,  
But now we're six months older,  
And everything you want and everything you see,  
Is out of reach, not good enough,  
I don't know what the hell you want from me but boy  
  
Uh huh huh,  
Oh, oh,  
Uh huh huh,  
Doo doo doo,  
La la la la  
  
Somebody tell me,  
Won't you tell me,  
Why I work so hard for you?  
All to give you money  
All to give you money  
  
Some people work for a living,  
Some people work for fun,  
Girl, I just work for you.  
They told me marriage was a give and take,  
Well, show me you can take you've got some giving to do.  
And now you tell me that you're having my baby,  
I'll tell you that I'm happy if you want me to  
One step further and my back will break,  
If my best isn't good enough  
Than how can it be good enough for two?  
I can't work any harder than I do  
  
Somebody tell me,  
Won't you tell me,  
Why I work so hard for you?  
All to give you money,  
All to give you money  
  
Oh,  
Why do I do the things I do?  
I'd tell you if I knew.  
My God,  
I don't even think that I love you,  
Won't you tell me,  
Tell me, tell me, tell me  
  
How could you settle for a boy like me,  
When all I could see was the end of the week  
All the things we sign,  
And the things we buy,  
Ain't gonna keep us together,  
It's just a matter of time.  
  
My situation,  
Never changes.  
Walking in that manner through that door,  
Like a stranger,  
But the wages,  
I give you all you say you want is love  
  
And all I can see is the end of the week,  
All the things we sign,  
And the things we buy,  
Ain't gonna keep us together  
Girl, it's just a matter of time.

One day you say you love me  
The next you tell me you don't  
One day you say you will  
And the next you tell me you won't  
Hey little baby  
There ain't much point in hanging around (Yea)  
One day you make me feel like your love is in my hands  
One day you say you'll stay  
The next you're changing your plans  
Hey little baby  
Ain't much point in hanging around (Yea)  
Cause' if you ain't got time for me I'll find another fantasy  
  
It is kind of funny that you think that  
I am the boy to make you cry  
I can make you happy  
If only for a while  
Little baby I can give you all the loving that your heart desires  
If you ain't got time for me I'll find another fantasy  
  
It could be the price of love  
Could the price of hate  
What am I guilty of  
Why do you make me wait  
So long I don't know your intentions  
Look to the sky's above  
I am in the hands of fate  
Push till it gets to shove  
I have got to know for heavens sake  
Is this love or invention  
Baby can't you see I'll find another fantasy  
  
You hang around with people who are sure to make you cry  
I can make you happy if only for a while  
Little baby oh, oh little baby  
I can give you all the lovin' that your heart desires  
If you ain't got time for me I'll find another fantasy  
  
You take someone's heart  
And you kick it around  
Keep on picking it up  
So you can watch it come down  
I don't know what I am suppose to do  
Why I wait for you to make up your mind  
Would you please be so kind  
When you know what to do I'll be in the next room  
But if you make it to late I may be in the next day  
Hmm...

That's all I wanted  
Something special, something sacred  
In your eyes  
For just one moment  
To be bold and naked  
At your side  
Sometimes I think that you'll never  
Understand me  
Maybe this time is forever  
Say it can be, whoh  
  
That's all you wanted  
Something special, someone sacred  
In your life  
Just for one moment  
To be warm and naked  
At my side  
  
Sometimes I think that you'll never  
Understand me  
But something tells me together  
We'd be happy, oh oh  
  
(Baby)  
I will be your father figure  
(Oh baby)  
Put your tiny hand in mine  
(I'd love to)  
I will be your preacher teacher  
(Be your daddy)  
Anything you have in mind  
(It would make me)  
I will be your father figure  
(Very happy)  
I have had enough of crime  
(Please let me)  
I will be the one who loves you  
'Til the end of time  
  
That's all I wanted  
But sometimes love can be mistaken  
For a crime  
That's all I wanted  
Just to see my baby's  
Blue eyes shine  
This time I think that my lover  
Understands me  
If we have faith in each other  
Then we can be  
Strong, baby  
  
I will be your father figure  
Put your tiny hand in mine  
I will be your preacher teacher  
Anything you have in mind  
I will be your father figure  
I have had enough of crime  
I will be the one who loves you  
'Til the end of time  
  
If you are the desert  
I'll be the sea  
If you ever hunger  
Hunger for me  
Whatever you ask for  
That's what I'll be  
  
So when you remember the ones who have lied  
Who said that they cared  
But then laughed as you cried  
Beautiful darling  
Don't think of me  
  
Because all I ever wanted  
It's in your eyes, baby,  
And love can't lie, no  
(Greet me with the eyes of a child)  
My love is always tellin' me so  
(Heaven is a kiss and a smile)  
Just hold on, hold on  
I won't let you go, my baby  
  
I will be your father figure  
Put your tiny hand in mine  
I will be your preacher teacher  
Anything you have in mind, baby  
I will be your father figure  
I have had enough of crime  
(So I am gonna love you)  
'Til the end of time  
I will be your father  
I will be your preacher  
I will be your daddy, whoa  
I will be the one who loves you 'til the end of time

I won't let you down  
I will not give you up  
Gotta have some faith in the sound  
It's the one good thing that I've got  
I won't let you down  
So please don't give me up  
Because I would really, really love to stick around, oh yeah  
  
Heaven knows I was just a young boy  
Didn't know what I wanted to be  
I was every little hungry schoolgirl's pride and joy  
And I guess it was enough for me  
To win the race? A prettier face!  
Brand new clothes and a big fat place  
On your rock and roll TV  
But today the way I play the game is not the same  
No way  
Think I'm gonna get me some happy  
  
I think there's something you should know  
I think it's time I told you so  
There's something deep inside of me  
There's someone else I've got to be  
Take back your picture in a frame  
Take back your singing in the rain  
I just hope you understand  
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man  
  
All we have to do now  
Is take these lies and make them true somehow  
All we have to see  
Is that I don't belong to you  
And you don't belong to me, yeah yeah  
  
Freedom, freedom, freedom  
You've gotta give for what you take  
Freedom, freedom, freedom  
You've gotta give for what you take  
  
Heaven knows we sure had some fun boy  
What a kick just a buddy and me  
We had every big shot good-time band on the run boy  
We were living in a fantasy  
We won the race  
Got out of the place  
I went back home got a brand new face  
For the boys at MTV  
But today the way I play the game has got to change  
Oh yeah  
Now I'm gonna get myself happy  
  
I think there's something you should know  
I think it's time I stopped the show  
There's something deep inside of me  
There's someone I forgot to be  
Take back your picture in a frame  
Don't think that I'll be back again  
I just hope you understand  
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man  
  
All we have to do now  
Is take these lies and make them true somehow  
All we have to see  
Is that I don't belong to you  
And you don't belong to me, yeah yeah  
  
Freedom, freedom, freedom  
You've gotta give for what you take  
Freedom, freedom, freedom  
You've gotta give for what you take  
  
Well it looks like the road to heaven  
But it feels like the road to hell  
When I knew which side my bread was buttered  
I took the knife as well  
Posing for another picture  
Everybody's got to sell  
But when you shake your ass  
They notice fast  
And some mistakes were built to last  
  
That's what you get  
I say that's what you get  
That's what you get for changing your mind  
And after all this time  
I just hope you understand  
Sometimes the clothes  
Do not make the man  
  
All we have to do now  
Is take these lies and make them true somehow  
All we have to see  
Is that I don't belong to you  
And you don't belong to me, yeah yeah  
  
Freedom, freedom, freedom  
You've gotta give for what you take  
Freedom, freedom, freedom  
You've gotta give for what you take  
  
Yeah you've gotta do what you do, what you do  
May not be what you want from me  
Just the way it's got to be  
Lose the face now  
I've got to live, got to live, got to live

Frosty the Snowman  
Was a jolly happy soul  
With a corncob pipe and a button nose  
And two eyes made out of coal  
  
Frosty the Snowman  
Is a fairytale they say  
He was made of snow  
But the children know  
How he came to life one day  
  
There must have been some magic  
In that old silk hat they found  
For when they placed it on his head  
He began to dance around  
  
Frosty the Snowman  
Was alive as he could be  
And the children say  
He could laugh and play  
Just the same as you and me  
  
Frosty the Snowman  
Knew the sun was hot that day  
So he said let's run  
And we'll have some fun  
Now before I melt away  
  
Down to the village  
With a broomstick in his hand  
Running here and there  
All around the square  
Saying catch me if you can  
  
He led them down the streets of town  
Right to the traffic cop  
And he only paused a moment when  
He heard him holler stop  
  
Frosty the Snowman  
Had to hurry on his way  
But he waved goodbye  
Saying don't you cry  
I'll be back again some day  
  
Thumpety thump thump  
Thumpety thump thump  
Look at Frosty go  
  
Thumpety thump thump  
Thumpety thump thump  
Over the hills of snow

Don't ask me how it could be  
Sometimes it's hard to believe  
That in my lifetime I could find that someone  
Who can make me complete  
You are the air that I breathe  
I'd surely die if you leave  
'cause I have never felt this way ' bout any girl like I feel for you  
So this is what I'm gonna do  
  
I'm giving you my heart forever  
Every beat of my heart says it's true  
I know we'll always be together forever  
You lovin' me - me lovin' you  
And I'm giving you my heart to you  
  
You are so special to me  
Your love is all that I need  
And I'm gonna spend the rest of my life  
Loving you faithfully  
  
This love I feel is so strong  
With you my heart's found a home  
'cause no one in this world could ever love me so tenderly  
So you can best believe  
  
I'm giving you my heart forever  
Every beat of my heart says it's true  
My love for you won't fade no never  
You lovin' me - me lovin' you  
And I'm giving you my heart to you  
  
And when I'm holding you close to me  
I know all of my dreams have come true  
Wanna let you know how I feel  
Girl my love is for real  
And I just wanna give it to you  
  
I'm giving you my heart forever  
Every beat of my heart says it's true  
I know we'll always be together forever

And I'm giving you my heart to you to you

And I'm giving you my heart to you  
To you and I'm giving my heart to you

Jimmy got nothing made himself a name  
With a gun that he polished for a rainy day  
A smile and a quote from a vigilante movie  
Our boy Jimmy just blew them all away  
He said it made him crazy  
Twenty five years living hand to mouth  
Hand to mouth, hand to mouth, hand to mouth  
  
Sweet little baby on a big white doorstep  
She needs her mother but her mother is dead  
Just another hooker that the lucky can forget  
Just another hooker  
It happens everyday  
She loved her little baby  
But she couldn't bare to see her living  
Hand to mouth, hand to mouth, hand to mouth, hand to mouth  
  
I believe in the gods of America  
I believe in the land of the free  
But no one told me  
(No one told me)  
That the gods believe in nothing  
So with empty hands I pray  
And from day to hopeless day  
They still don't see me  
(See me)  
  
Everybody talks about the new generation  
Jump on the wagon or they'll leave you behind  
But no one gave a thought to the rest of the nation  
Like to help you buddy, but I haven't got the time  
Somebody shouted save me  
And everybody started living hand to mouth  
Hand to mouth, hand to mouth, hand to mouth  
  
There's a big white lady  
On a big white doorstep  
She asked her daddy and her daddy said 'yes'  
Has to give a little for the dollars that we get  
Has to give a little  
They say it's for the best  
Somebody shouted  
Maybe  
But they kept on living from hand to mouth  
Hand to mouth, hand to mouth, hand to mouth  
  
So she ran to the arms of America  
And she kissed the powers that be  
And someone told me  
(Someone told me)  
That the gods believe in nothing  
So with empty hands I pray  
And I tell myself  
One day  
They just might see me

First you take of your hat  
Then you take of those brand new shoes  
Say 'Hey George, what've you got to lose?'  
With my hand on yur thigh  
I just look you in the eye and say  
'Not a whole lot baby  
But a whole lot more than you'  
  
I can make you happy (yeah, yeah)  
Don't you know that?  
She said  
I can make you happy  
  
Boys and girls  
The ones who kiss and tell  
Why should we have to believe them?  
No, I don't understand  
How any woman, how any man  
Can say 'Lay me down, lay me down'  
For that big stash-cheap cash-think about the money  
  
I can make you happy (yeah, yeah)  
Don't you know that?  
She said  
I can make you happy  
  
I've seen you in the corner  
With your rub-it-on tan  
Hitching a ride  
Could be a woman or a man  
Gonna get what you want before too long  
Gonna take your oppurtunities  
Right or wrong  
  
Some poor cow with a seven-year itch?  
You don't dig men  
But you'll fuch 'em if they're rich  
You can't be--with me  
You're a low life, daughterofasonofabitch

Don't bring me down  
Don't bring me down  
Don't bring me down  
  
I've never been one for playing games  
You can move your mouth forever  
But the words sound just the same  
Something like  
Bang bang you're dead  
Couldn't we just make love instead  
Say yes 'cause it's what we do best  
And I've had such a hard day  
  
Take me where their eyes can't find us  
Without you I may as well just  
  
How much do I have to say  
What more do you have to see  
What will it take to make you love me  
Oh well you're not the first  
You're not the last  
You're not even the one who loves me the best  
But all I think about is you  
  
Take me where their eyes can't find us  
Without you I may as well just  
  
Take me where their eyes can't find us  
Without you I may as well just  
  
Don't bring me down  
Don't bring me down  
Don't bring me down  
  
Please don't wander from my door  
I've never been one for playing games  
You can move your mouth forever  
But the words sound just the same  
Ow  
Bang bang you're dead  
Couldn't we just make love instead  
Say yes because it's what we do best  
And I've had such a hard day  
  
So don't bring me down  
Won't you give me break  
Somebody give me a break now!  
  
Don't bring me down  
Don't bring me down  
Don't bring me down  
  
Sweet little boy with oh such a big mouth  
Harsh words can get you into hot water  
When people don't understand you baby  
I'm always here for you  
And I  
And I will never bring you down, down, down, down  
Down my baby  
  
Trust me  
I want you to trust me  
Oh, oh trust me  
'Cause I won't bring you down  
(Don't bring me down)  
I won't bring you down  
Do you trust me  
Yeah

Let me tell you a secret  
Put it in your heart and keep it  
Something that I want you to know  
Do something for me  
Listen to my simple story  
And maybe we'll have something to show  
  
You tell me you're cold on the inside  
How can the outside world  
Be a place that your heart can embrace  
Be good to yourself  
Because nobody else  
Has the power to make you happy  
  
How can I help you  
Please let me try to  
I can heal the pain  
That you're feeling inside  
Whenever you want me  
You know that I will be  
Waiting for the day  
That you say you'll be mine  
  
He must have really hurt you  
To make you say the things that you do  
He must have really hurt you  
To make those pretty eyes look so blue  
  
He must have known  
That he could  
That you'd never leave him  
Now you can't see my love is good  
And that I'm not him  
  
How can I help you  
Please let me try to  
I can heal the pain  
That you're feeling inside  
Whenever you want me  
You know that I will be  
Waiting for the day  
That you say you'll be mine  
  
Who needs a lover  
That can't be a friend  
Something tells me I'm the one you've been looking for  
If you ever should see him again  
Won't you tell him you've found someone who gives you more  
  
Someone who will protect you  
Love and respect you  
All those things  
That he never could bring to you  
Like I do  
Or rather I would  
Won't you show me your heart  
Like you should  
  
Won't you let me in  
Let this love begin  
Won't you show me your heart now  
I'll be good to you  
I can make this thing true  
And get to your heart somehow

Another summer, another vacation is over  
A september morning with the sun and smell of the clover  
Down by the gates we sit and watch all our friends go by  
And pretend we don't hear the bell that rings through the  
Summer sky  
  
I was happy with the kisses she gave me  
It's just that happy was she made me  
Happy that was until I saw you  
  
Chorus:  
Heartbeat, heartbeat, why do you fail me now?  
You hurt me, desert me in my darkest hour  
Heartbeat, heartbeat, why do you keep me here?  
How could I help but admire her beauty  
Standing on the line between desire and duty  
Heartbeat, heartbeat, it will end in tears  
  
I need a lover that loves such a dangerous place to be  
Oh, if we were meant for each other then why don't you answer me  
Don't keep me waiting, you know that I long to be by your side  
  
I was happy with the kisses she gave me  
Now there's nothing on earth that can save me  
Why should I care I can have you?  
  
Chorus to fade

Shattered dreams, Worthless years  
Here am I encased inside a hollow shell  
Life began, Then was done  
Now I stare into a cold and empty well  
The many sounds that greet our ears  
The sights our eyes befall  
Will open up our merging hearts  
And feed our empty souls  
  
I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever  
I believe when I fall in love this time it will be forever  
  
Without despair, we will share  
And the joys of caring will not be erased  
What has been, must never end  
The joys of caring will not be replaced  
When the seeds of love have planted firm  
They won't be hard to find  
And the songs of love I sing to you  
Will echo in my mind  
  
Hey!  
I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever. I said.  
I believe when I fall in love this time it will be forever.  
I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever. Yeah!  
I believe when I fall in love this time it will be forever.  
I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever.  
I believe when I fall in love this time it will be forever.  
I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever. Yeah!  
  
I believe when I fall in love this time it will be forever.  
You know god has answered my prayers  
Won't you listen to me now  
God for sure will answer my prayers  
Won't you listen to me now  
God will answer your prayers  
Just ask him and God is sure to answer all your prayers  
Oh come on and lets fall in love  
  
Your the one that I've been waiting for  
Come on lets fall in love  
Your the woman that I adore  
Don't you wanna  
Fall in love with me baby  
Don't you wanna  
Fall in love with me this time, this time, this time  
Oh, no no no  
Don't you wanna fall  
Don't you wanna fall in love  
Oh, no no no  
Yeah  
This time  
  
O.K. I want you to sing this after me  
It will be forever  
It will be forever  
Don't you wanna fall in love  
Come on, Come on don't you wanna fall in love  
With me forever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever  
It will be forever  
Don't you wanna  
Don't you wanna fall in love with me, baby, Yeah!  
Don't you wanna  
Don't you wanna fall in love with me this time, this time, this time  
Oh, no no no  
Don't you wanna fall in  
Don't you wanna fall in love  
Oh, no no no. Oh!  
Whoo!

Like a warrior that fights  
And wins the battle  
I know the taste of victory  
Though I went through some nights  
Consumed by the shadows  
  
And was crippled emotionally  
Somehow I made it through the heartace  
I escaped  
I found my way out of the darkness, kept my faith  
Kept my faith  
  
[Chorus]  
And the river was deep I didn't falter  
When the mountain was high  
I still believed  
When the valley was low  
It didn't stop me  
I knew you were waiting  
  
Knew you were waiting for me  
With and endless desire  
I kept on searching  
Sure in time our eyes would meet  
And like the bridge is on fire  
  
The hurt is over  
One touch and you set me free  
I don't regret a single moment  
Looking back, when I think of all those disappointments  
I just laugh, I just laugh  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So we were drawn together through destiny  
I know this love we share was meant to be  
It's only love

I remember you  
You're the one who made my dreams come true  
A few kisses ago  
  
I remember you  
You're the one who said I love you too  
Didn't you know  
  
I remember too  
A distant bell  
And stars that fell  
Like rain out of the blue  
  
When my life is through  
And the angels ask me to recall  
The thrill of them all  
Then I will tell them I remember you  
  
I remember you  
You're the one who made my dreams come true  
A few kisses ago  
  
I remember you  
You're the one who said I love you too  
Didn't you know  
  
I remember too  
A distant bell  
And stars that fell  
Like rain out of the blue  
I miss you darling  
  
When my life is through  
And the angels ask me to recall  
The thrill of them all  
Then I will tell them I remember you

Dark Child Hey baby,  
Ha ha ha  
  
Chorus  
If I told you that  
I wanted to see you  
And if I told you that  
I'd beg to please you  
If I told you that  
I'll always keep you  
What would you say?  
If I told you that  
  
[George]  
Now tell me how you'd feel  
If I told you that  
I had feelings for you, yeah  
Tell me baby  
  
[Whitney]  
And would it be so wrong  
To say what's on my mind  
I'm sorry I have to baby, baby  
  
We were friends  
But with time  
What I feel deep inside  
For you has changed  
But I'd give up for love  
If I thought that it was untrue (Untrue)  
For you (For you baby)  
  
Chorus  
  
[George]  
I know that we're just friends  
But what if I decide  
To bring something in,  
Ooh yeah Baby, baby  
  
[Whitney]  
I hope it won't offend  
The trust we have cuz  
I don't want this to end  
No, no, no, baby  
  
If you think we will lose what we have  
Then I'd just rather stay the same  
(Rather stay, rather stay the same)  
Cuz I don't want to chose between two  
Of the most precious things to me  
(Precious things to me, oh yeah)  
  
Chorus  
  
[Whitney](George)  
If we (If we)  
Take this chance (Take this chance)  
And extend to each other romance  
I hope (Baby I hope)  
It would be (It would be)  
The right thing for you and me, oh yeah  
Baby, baby, baby, baby  
  
Chorus  
  
If I told you that  
Chorus  
  
If I told you that (Yeah, yeah, yeah)  
Would you be there for me?  
(Could you?) Could you dare to hold me?  
Will my feelings lead me, love always  
(Baby what would you say?)  
  
If I told you  
Chorus

You're the one that makes my day  
A dream come true  
Yet and still you wonder  
If I think of you  
You ought to see how the other girls behave  
When you're not around  
And only then you would know  
That it's on your finger I'm wound  
  
Uh-huh  
  
Chorus:  
If you were there you'd know  
If you were there you'd know  
If you were there you'd know  
That I care  
  
There's no need for you not to have faith in me  
Cause it's by your side girl  
That I long to be  
Yes there are times with my friends  
When I don't have much to say  
But what you don't know is with you  
I could never act that way  
  
(Repeat chorus)  
  
I care for you baby  
  
I swear that I care  
  
There's no need for you not to have faith in me  
Cause it's by you're side girl  
That I long to be  
Yes there are times with my friends  
When I don't have much to say (Uh-huh)  
But what you don't know is with you  
I could never act that way  
  
(Repeat chorus)  
  
I care for you baby  
  
I swear that I care for you baby  
I do  
Have faith in me  
  
I care for you baby  
  
Oh-oh

It doesn't really matter that I loved you  
How many reasons call  
It doesn't really matter at all  
It doesn't really matter that I failed to  
Break down your father's wall  
It doesn't really matter at all  
  
Why tell me you don't understand when you do  
I thought I had something to say  
  
But it doesn't really matter at all...  
I changed my name to be rid of the things that I want from you  
It's strange but the name is a name and the truth is a truth  
  
Oh, there is always, always someone there to remind me  
So I learn to live with shame  
I tell myself I feel no pain  
But I do and if I have to tell you  
  
Then it doesn't really matter at all...  
And it's no good looking back  
Because time is a thief and I believe that I'm too old for that  
We're just saying the things that we have said forever  
  
It doesn't really matter that I loved you  
How many reasons fall  
It's too bad  
It really doesn't matter at all

It's just your jive talkin' telling me lies  
Jive talkin' you wear a disguise  
Jive talkin' so misunderstood, yeh  
Jive talkin' you're really no good  
Oh my child, you'll never know  
Just what you mean to me  
Oh my child you got so much  
You gonna take away my energy  
With all your jive talkin' you telling me lies, yeh  
Good loving still gets in my eyes  
Nobody believe what you say  
It's just your jive talkin', that's gets in the way, oh no  
Ta bee rup...  
Oh my love you're so good  
Treating me so cruel  
There you go with your fancy lies  
Leaving me looking like a dumb struck fool  
With all your jive talkin', you telling me lies, yeh  
Jive talkin' you wear a disguise  
Jive talkin' so misunderstood, yeh  
Jive talkin' you just ain't no good  
You know love talkin' is all very fine, yeh  
Jive talkin' just isn't a crime  
And if there's somebody you'll love till you die  
Then all that jive talkin' just gets in your eye...  
Jive talkin' telling me lies yeh  
Good loving still gets in my eyes  
Nobody believe what you say  
It's just your jive talkin', that gets in your way...

Close friend of mine as a child fell into a slumber  
No sign of life since '75  
Then one day he just, what do you know  
I guess God just called his number  
  
He called me up he called me up and said  
"I've been awake about a week  
I'm thinking about asking the doctor  
If he could put me back to sleep"  
Then he laughed and said  
"Hey all the girls they look the same"  
Don't they know just what their mothers  
Paid in blood, and tears to change  
  
But the words that made me cry  
The thing he softly said  
It stayed with me, it keeps messing with my head  
He said, "If Jesus Christ is alive and well  
Then how come John and Elvis are dead?"  
  
Youth, beautiful youth  
We walked through the walls until we found the truth  
And said "Change it, it's ugly just change it"  
Everyone we used to know  
Must have given up, so long ago  
You can see it, it's written on their faces  
And the inside of their clothes  
  
But the words that made me cry  
'Cause I knew just what they meant  
He turned to me and said  
"Hey boy, if Jesus Christ is alive and well  
Then how come John and Elvis are dead?"  
  
"Tell me if Jesus Christ is alive and well  
Then how come Marvin and Elvis are dead?"  
  
I said "If Jesus Christ is going to save us from ourselves  
How come peace, love and Elvis are dead?"

You are far,  
When I could have been your star,  
You listened to people,  
Who scared you to death and from my heart,  
Strange that you were strong enough,  
To even make a start,  
But you'll never find  
Peace of mind,  
Til you listen to your heart  
  
People,  
You can never change the way they feel,  
Better let them do just what they will,  
For they will,  
If you let them,  
Steal your heart from you,  
People,  
Will always make a lover feel a fool,  
But you knew I loved you,  
We could have shown them all,  
We should have seen love through  
  
Fooled me with the tears in your eyes,  
Covered me with kisses and lies,  
So goodbye,  
But please don't take my heart  
  
You are far,  
I'm never gonna be your star,  
I'll pick up the pieces  
And mend my heart,  
Maybe I'll be strong enough,  
I don't know where to start,  
But I'll never find  
Peace of mind,  
While I listen to my heart  
  
People,  
You can never change the way they feel,  
Better let them do just what they will,  
For they will,  
If you let them,  
Steal your heart  
  
And people,  
Will always make a lover feel a fool,  
But you knew I loved you,  
We could have shown them all  
  
But remember this,  
Every other kiss,  
That you ever give  
Long as we both live  
When you need the hand of another man,  
One you really can surrender with,  
I will wait for you,  
Like I always do,  
There's something there,  
That can't compare with any other  
  
You are far,  
When I could have been your star,  
You listened to people,  
Who scared you to death and from my heart,  
Strange that I was wrong enough,  
To think you'd love me too.  
I guess you were kissing a fool,  
You must have been kissing a fool.

I loved you once  
But look at you now  
You're in somebody else's bed  
I loved you once  
So I don't know how  
You're with a man like that  
You'd be better off dead  
He don't care  
He don't treat you right  
It's not fair  
I still want you at night  
Can't you see you made a mistake, girl  
He treats you like dirt and I hate it  
  
Na na na na na na lady look at your hands  
You got two fat children and a drunken man  
Betcha don't, betcha don't, betcha don't like your life  
Betcha don't, betcha don't, betcha don't like it  
Ma ma ma ma baby look at your hands  
You should have been my woman when you had the chance  
Betcha don't, betcha don't, betcha don't like your life  
Betcha don't, betcha don't, betcha don't like your life now  
  
He hits you once  
He hits you twice  
He don't care about the blood on his hands  
But that's okay  
'Cause it's his wife  
"It's the only thing she understands," he says  
  
Say you're gonna leave him  
Say you're gonna try  
But you're only talking (you're only talking)  
Oh I know you think I'm a young boy  
But I'm good and I think we can make it  
  
Na na na na na na lady look at your hands  
You got two fat children and a drunken man  
Betcha don't, betcha don't, betcha don't like your life  
Betcha don't, betcha don't, betcha don't like it  
Ma ma ma ma baby look at your hands  
You should have been my woman when you had the chance  
Betcha don't, betcha don't, betcha don't like your life  
Betcha don't, betcha don't, betcha don't like your life now  
  
(Don't like your guy now)  
  
Well excuse me baby but it's making me mad  
The only one you want is the only one you'll never have  
It's so sad  
The only one you'll never have  
It's too bad  
Only one you'll never have  
  
Na na na na na na lady look at your hands  
You've got two fat children and a drunken man  
And I bet you don't like your life now

Chorus:  
I'm just a love machine  
And I won't work for nobody but you,  
I'm just a love machine,  
A huggin', kissin' friend.  
  
I think it's high time you knew,  
Whenever I think of you,  
My mind blows a fuse.  
When I look in you eyes,  
My meter starts to rise, and I become confused.  
My voltage regulator cools,  
When I'm sitting next to you,  
Electricity starts to flow,  
And my indicator starts to glow - wooo  
  
Chorus  
  
Na, na na na na, na na na na, woo-woo-wooo  
Na, na na na na, na na na na, na naaah  
  
Chorus  
  
I'm gentle as a lamb,  
I'm not that hard to program,  
There's no way that you can lose,  
My chassis fits like a glove,  
I've got a button for love,  
That you have got-to-use.  
If you look into my file,  
I am sure you can find out how,  
To turn me on just set my dial,  
And let me love you for a little while - ooh  
  
Chorus  
  
Na, na na na na, na na na na, woo-woo-wooo  
Na, na na na na, na na na na, na naaah

Is there a time for keeping a distance  
A time to turn your eyes away  
Is there a time for keeping your head down  
For getting on with your day  
  
Is there a time for Kohl and lipstick  
A time for cutting hair  
Is there a time for high street shopping  
To find the right dress to wear  
  
Here she comes  
Heads turn around  
Here she comes  
To take her crown  
  
Is there a time to walk for cover  
A time for kiss and tell  
Is there a time for different colors  
Different names you find it hard to spell  
  
Is there a time for first communion  
A time for east 17  
Is there a time to turn the mecca  
Is there a time to be a beauty queen  
  
Here she comes  
Beauty plays the crown  
Here she comes  
Surreal in her crown  
  
Dici che il fiume  
trova la via al mare  
E come il fiume  
giungerai a me  
Oltre i confini  
e le terre assetate  
Dici che come fiume  
come fiume  
L'amore giunger  
L'amore  
E non so pi pregare  
E nell'amore non so pi sperare  
E quell'amore non so pi aspettare  
  
English translation:  
You say that the river  
finds the way to the sea  
And as the river  
you'll come to me  
Beyond the borders  
and the thirsty lands  
You say that as river  
As river  
Love will come  
Love  
And I cannot pray anymore  
And I cannot hope in love anymore  
And I cannot wait for love anymore  
  
Is there a time for tying ribbons  
A time for Christmas trees  
Is there a time for laying tables  
When the night is set to freeze

Why can't you do it?  
Why can't you set your monkey free?  
Always giving into it  
Do you love your monkey or do you love me?  
  
Why can't you do it?  
Why do I have to share my baby with a monkey?  
Monkey with a monkey monkey  
La la la  
  
Oh, I count to ten  
But I don't know how  
And I don't know when  
To open my eyes  
  
Baby if you kiss me again  
Like you did just now  
Like you did just then  
Just Do it again  
  
I've had the rest  
Now it's time I had the best  
So you tell me  
That you won't do anymore  
  
Well I'd write your heart a letter  
But I think you know me better  
If I keep on asking baby, maybe  
I'll get what I'm asking for  
  
Why can't you do it?  
Why can't you set your monkey free?  
Always giving in to it  
Do you love your monkey or do you love me?  
  
Why can't you do it?  
Why do I have to share my baby with a monkey?  
Monkey, with a monkey, monkey  
La la la  
  
Oh, I hate your friends  
But I don't know how and I don't know when  
To open your eyes  
Yes, the monkey's back again  
Do you want him now like you did back then?  
  
I tried my best but your head is such a mess  
So I guess that I don't want you anymore  
Well you say you care about me  
That you just can't do without me  
But you keep on dancin' baby  
'Til that monkey has you on the floor  
  
Why can't you do it?  
Why can't you set your monkey free?  
Always giving into it  
Do you love the monkey or do you love me?  
  
Why can't you do it  
Why do I have to share my baby with a monkey?  
Monkey, with a monkey, monkey  
La la la  
  
Don't look now  
There's a monkey on your back  
Don't look now  
There's a monkey on you  
Don't look now  
There's a monkey on your back  
Don't look now  
There's a monkey on you  
  
So you tell me  
That you won't do anymore  
If I keep on askin' baby, maybe  
I'll get what I'm askin' for  
  
Why can't you do it?  
Why can't you set your monkey free?  
Always giving into it  
Do you love the monkey or do you love me?  
  
Why can't you do it?  
Why do I have to share my baby with a monkey?  
Monkey, with a monkey, monkey  
La la la  
  
Why can't you do it?  
Why can't you set your monkey free?  
Always giving into it  
Do you love the monkey or do you love me?  
  
Why can't you do it?  
Why do I have to share my baby with a monkey?  
Monkey, with a monkey, monkey  
La la la

Oh she knows  
She takes his hand  
And prays the child will understand  
At the door they watch the men go by  
In the clothes that daddy wore  
  
Mother's pride  
Baby boy  
His fathers eyes  
He's a soldier waiting for war  
Time will come  
He'll hold a gun  
His father's son  
  
And as he grows  
He hears the band  
Takes the step from boy to man  
And at the shore she waves her son goodbye  
Like the man she did before  
  
Mother's pride  
Just a boy  
His country's eyes  
He's a soldier waving at the shore  
And in her heart the time has come  
To lose a son  
  
And all the husbands, all the sons, all the lovers gone  
They make no difference  
No difference in the end  
Still hear the woman say your father died a hero  
In the name of God and man  
  
Mother's pride  
Crazy boy  
His lifeless eyes  
He's a soldier now forevermore  
He'll hold a gun 'till kingdom come

I've been in and out of favor with lady luck  
I gotta tell you  
I've seen things I never wanted to see  
I've got to get back on my feet  
I feel like I've been sleeping  
Sweet, sweet time  
Has been a real good friend of mine  
  
Waiting for that change of season  
Oh the winter's been so long  
Searching for that rhyme or reason  
You've just got to  
  
[Chorus]  
Move on  
Hold it together, move on  
Life's so short, move on  
Only time will set you free  
You put your tears behind you  
Better get yourself where you want to be  
I think of all the days and nights I spent crying  
And I move on  
  
I've been in and out of favor with love  
Because I gotta tell you  
I've been things I never wanted to be  
And then some angel called me up  
He told me I was sleeping  
Said "don't waste time 'cause even angels say goodbye"  
  
Waiting for that change of season  
Oh the winter's been so long  
Searching for that rhyme or reason  
You've just got to  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And oh, there goes another season  
Getting hard to find a decent sonng to play  
But oh, I guess I got my reasons  
Everybody thinks I'm doing a.o.k  
They ought to know by now  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm gonna be luck in love someday

My baby don't care for shows  
My baby don't care for clothes  
My baby just cares for me  
  
My baby don't care for cars and races  
My baby don't care for high tone places  
  
Elizabeth Taylor is not his style  
And even Ricky Martin's smile  
Is something he can't see  
My baby don't care who knows it  
My baby just cares for me  
  
I wonder what's wrong with baby  
My baby just cares for  
He just says his prayers for  
My baby just cares  
For me

My mother had a brother  
They say that I was born on the day that he died  
Someone to cling to, she said  
When all the noises and the shame came calling  
  
My mother had a brother  
I thought I knew them all, I thought I knew  
But she lied  
I said, "Show me his face again, tell me again why he died"  
  
She said he couldn't wait for the things that I've seen  
She said he wasn't strong enough, he never dared to dream a life like mine  
  
My mother had a brother  
Over-sensitive and kind  
Seems it all became too much for him.  
It seems he took his own life  
Mum, I can't imagine the joy and pain in equal measure  
Tears in the dirt, and all over your newborn treasure  
  
I guess he had to wait until my momma had me  
I guess he couldn't wait another moment to be free  
In endless sky  
  
But mama will you tell him from your boy  
The times they changed  
I guess the world was getting warmer  
And we got stronger  
Mother will you tell him about my joy  
I live each day for him  
The sun came out, yeah, and I'm just breathing it in  
  
My mother had a brother  
Same desire, different time  
Seems the empty spaces tortured him  
Until he took his own life  
  
I don't know why I waited so long for love  
I just don't know what I was thinking of  
All that wasted time  
  
But mama will you tell him from your boy  
The times they changed  
I guess the world was getting warmer  
While we got stronger  
Mother will you tell him about my joy  
I live each day with him  
Your son came out, yeah,  
And I'm still breathing it in  
  
And I swear now that freedom is here  
I'm gonna taste it all for you boy  
I'm bad to the bone, I'm just a little torn  
I'm making so much love  
  
So those of us who have nothing to fear  
We've got to make damn sure that it was worth it  
I'm bad to the bone, I'm just a little stoned  
I'm making so much love  
  
I was a prisoner, but he saved me  
Broke into my dreams and said, "Who cares?"  
I was a prisoner, so disgrace me  
I'm glad to be home  
And I don't believe they care.

Hey Nikita is it cold  
In your little corner of the world  
You could roll around the globe  
And never find a warmer soul to know  
  
Oh I saw you by the wall  
Ten of your tin soldiers in a row  
With eyes that looked like ice on fire  
The human heart a captive in the snow  
  
Oh Nikita You will never know anything about my home  
I'll never know how good it feels to hold you  
Nikita I need you so  
Oh Nikita is the other side of any given line in time  
Counting ten tin soldiers in a row  
Oh no, Nikita you'll never know  
  
Do you ever dream of me  
Do you ever see the letters that I write  
When you look up through the wire  
Nikita do you count the stars at night  
  
And if there comes a time  
Guns and gates no longer hold you in  
And if you're free to make a choice  
Just look towards the west and find a friend

I watch you breathe, I cannot sleep,  
I touch your hair, I kiss your skin,  
And hope the morning sun won't wake you too soon.  
For when you wake, and look at me,  
You never know, you just might see,  
Another boy who crept in your room...  
Take your time...(that's what you told me),  
Take your time...  
But I fell head first, and I just don't know what to do.  
  
Chorus:  
Nothing looks the same in the light,  
Only a fool like me would take to heart,  
The things you said you meant last night.  
Nothing looks the same in the light,  
I'll keep my feet firm on the ground.  
Nothing looks the same in the light,  
There's danger in a stranger,  
With a warm hand and a kiss so right.  
Nothing looks the same in the light,  
It's been a pleasure, - see you around...  
  
I watch the sun, upon the sheets.  
I hear a car, out on the street,  
And gently pull you close, it's over too soon.  
What can I do, but wait and see,  
Hold on to you, please stay with me,  
Because you're the first, and I want to stay here with you.  
  
Chorus

I should have known  
It seemed too easy  
You were there  
And I was breathing blue  
  
Strange  
Don't you think I'm looking older?  
But something good has happened to me  
Change is a stranger  
You have yet to know  
  
Well you're out of time  
I'm letting go  
You'll be fine  
Well that much I know  
You're out of time  
I'm letting go  
I'm not the man you want  
  
I should have known  
It seemed so easy  
You were there  
I thought I needed you  
  
Strange  
Don't you think I'm looking older?  
But something good has happened to me  
Change is a strange  
Who never seems to show  
  
Well you're out of time  
I'm letting go  
You'll be fine  
(or maybe you won't)  
You're out of time  
I'm letting go  
  
I'm not the man that you want  
  
I never should have looked back in your direction  
I know that  
Just the same old fights again, baby  
These are wasted days without affection  
I'm not that foolish anymore

Back to nature, just human nature  
Getting on back to  
I think I'm done with the sofa  
I think I'm done with the hall  
I think I'm done with the kitchen table, baby  
  
Let's go outside (let's go outside)  
In the sunshine  
I know you want to, but you can't say yes  
Let's go outside (let's go outside)  
In the moonshine  
Take me to the places that I love best  
  
So my angel she says, don't you worry  
about the things they're saying, yeah  
Got no friends in high places  
And the game that you gave away  
Wasn't worth playing  
  
Let's go outside (let's go outside)  
In the sunshine  
I know you want to, but you can't say yes  
Let's go outside (let's go outside)  
In the meantime  
Take me to the places that I love best  
  
And yes I've been bad  
Doctor won't you do with me what you can  
You see I think about it all the time  
Twenty four seven  
  
You say you want it, you got it  
I never really said it before  
There's nothing here but flesh and bone  
There's nothing more nothing more  
There's nothing more  
  
Back to nature, just human nature  
Getting on back to  
  
I think I m done with the sofa  
I think I m done with the hall  
I think I'm done with the kitchen table, baby  
  
Let's go outside (let's go outside)  
In the sunshine  
I know you want to, but you can't say yes  
Let's go outside (let's go outside)  
In the moonshine  
Take me to the places that I love best  
  
And yes I've been bad  
Doctor won't you do with me what you can  
You see I think about it all the time  
I'd service the community  
(But I already have you see!)  
I never really said it before  
  
There's nothing here but flesh and bone  
There's nothing more, nothing more  
There's nothing more  
Let's go outside  
Dancing on the d-train baby  
  
When the moon is high  
And the grass is jumpin'  
Come on, just keep on funkin'  
Keep on funkin', just keep on funkin'

Papa was a rollin' stone  
  
It was the third of september  
That day i'll always remember, yes I will  
'cause that was the day that my daddy died  
  
Never had a chance to see him, no  
Never heard nothin' but bad things about him  
Mama, i'm depending on you to tell me the truth  
Mama just hung her head and said  
  
Chorus  
"papa was a rollin' stone  
Wherever he laid his hat was his home  
And when he died  
All he left us was alone" (repeat)  
  
Hey, mama, is it true what they say  
That papa never worked a day in his life  
Some bad talk going around sayin'  
Papa had there outside children  
And another wife  
That ain't right  
  
Heard some talk about papa and his storefront  
Preachin'  
Talkin' about saving souls and all the time  
Leaching  
And dealing in dirt  
Stealin' in the name of the lord  
  
But mama she just said  
  
Chorus  
  
Say, I heard my papa was a jack of all trades  
Is that what sent papa to an early grave?  
Folks say papa would beg, borrow or steal just  
To pay his bills.  
Hey, mama, folks say papa was never much on thinkin'  
Spent most of his time chansin' women and drinkin'  
But mother, i'm depending on you to tell me the  
Truth  
  
But my mama she just said  
  
Chorus(2x)

Patience  
  
It's like a conversation, where no-one stops to breathe  
Is it my imagination, or did God already leave the table?  
Such destruction, and pure white castles in the sand  
No time for introduction  
With all that money changing hands  
  
And the satellite says, "Take a look at all we have"  
But the old man says,  
"You want my family, for your liberty, I can't do that."  
  
Look into the eyes of any patient man  
Whether they be amber, green or blue,  
There's a piece of God staring back at you  
But they see our children, and the old folk fend for themselves  
They see our broken women  
On imaginary shelves  
  
But the satellite says, "Won't you people look at all we have?  
Don't you want it?  
  
Can't you see the things that you lack?"  
  
Children in his arms, he turns his back.

Some people said, if I could only care for you  
Some people said, he will never love again  
Some people said, you can see it in his eyes  
He keeps it all inside and yet. .. .  
Some people say, in time, we all teach ourselves to live this way  
  
And for a thousand days, I was lost  
I thought never to be found,  
Underground  
And don't you think I'm ready now?  
So please send me someone to love. ..  
  
Please send me someone, someone to love  
As much as I loved you  
(The way I loved you, darlin')  
Please, please send me someone, someone to love  
Please send me someone  
  
Any time, any day, any time, any day now  
Any time any day, any time, any day now  
Please, please send me someone  
Just to hold me now that you're gone  
  
Some people say, " I hope you know I'm there for you"  
Some of the people said - nothing,  
And nothing was just fine  
(You know how I get sometimes. ..)  
  
And for a thousand days, I was lost  
I said, " Heaven knows I'm ready to be found",  
Underground  
But I think I'm ready now  
So please send me someone to love  
  
Please send me someone, someone to love  
As much as I loved you  
Please, please send me someone, someone to love  
Please send me someone  
Please send me someone  
  
Any time any day any time any day now  
Any time any day any time any day now  
Please, please send me someone  
  
So say that you will, because the nights are long  
Without our song to sing  
Just search the clouds until. .. Until  
So say that you will  
Show me right from wrong,  
Without our song to sing  
Just search the clouds until. .. Until  
And Darlin' darlin' though I can't replace you, there's a  
Space in my heart  
A space that you left in my heart  
Just give me something that will pull me back from the blue  
  
Oh send me someone like you  
  
Darlin' darlin' no I can't replace you, there's a space in my heart  
A space that you left in my heart  
Just give me something that will pull me back from the blue  
  
Please send me someone to love

These are the days of the open hand  
They will not be the last  
Look around now  
These are the days of the beggars and the choosers  
  
This is the year of the hungry man  
Whose place is in the past  
Hand in hand with ignorance  
And legitimate excuses  
  
The rich declare themselves poor  
And most of us are not sure  
If we have too much  
But we'll take our chances  
Because god's stopped keeping score  
I guess somewhere along the way  
He must have let us alt out to play  
Turned his back and all god's children  
Crept out the back door  
  
And it's hard to love, there's so much to hate  
Hanging on to hope  
When there is no hope to speak of  
And the wounded skies above say it's much too late  
Well maybe we should all be praying for time  
  
These are the days of the empty hand  
Oh you hold on to what you can  
And charity is a coat you wear twice a year  
  
This is the year of the guilty man  
Your television takes a stand  
And you find that what was over there is over here  
  
So you scream from behind your door  
Say "what's mine is mine and not yours"  
I may have too much but i'll take my chances  
Because god's stopped keeping score  
And you cling to the things they sold you  
Did you cover your eyes when they told you  
  
That he can't come back  
Beacuse he has no children to come back for  
  
It's hard to love there's so much to hate  
Hanging on to hope when there is no hope to speak of  
And the wounded skies above say it's much too late  
So maybe we should all be praying for time

In my house there's a circle, where the life comes in  
From the stars to my home, down through the stone,  
I could have been so alone,  
Without my precious box  
Have I a family? I guess not  
I've never seen a lot of beauty  
In my life.  
  
Well in your house there are servants, and the lights all dim  
Such a beautiful home, your agent's on the phone, they never  
Leave you alone  
The party never stops!  
You say that's fantasy, I say "So what, I need a little  
Beauty"  
  
So let me in,  
You know you've kind of got under my skin  
You know we never see a lot of the action round here  
My dear  
You may want to strip again  
  
And you look so fine in your Gucci suit  
And you're making more money than your daddy  
Could have imagined  
But people can go out of fashion, honey, yeah, any time  
  
So take that picture, stop acting so dumb  
Don't you know that the moment will come  
I will find someone like you  
But with something extra, I'm sorry baby  
I don't know why  
I don't know why that is  
  
The systematic breakdown of my community  
You know I hate my job, I try to save but God  
There's just never enough  
Switch on, the pressure, stops  
You know the one for me, she's on Fox  
And she's a little beauty  
  
Give me your life, give me your life, I want it  
Because lately, it's so freezing out here  
(This side of the glass, life keeps kicking my ass)  
In so many ways, but you make it good  
Made me the kind of happy that my baby never could  
(This side of the glass)  
  
So take that picture, stop acting so dumb  
Don't you know that the moment will come  
I will find someone like you  
But with something extra, I'm so sorry baby  
I don't know why  
I don't know why that is  
  
Precious keeps me company  
Keeps me from being alone  
  
Because no-one comes in the morning  
No-one comes in the evening time  
I'd sit and wait for the phone to ring  
I could be waiting my whole damn life  
  
So sick of the same old faces  
In this street, where nobody talks to me  
And the funny side of the situation is  
I don't care, I'll always be there  
  
When you come down from the sky  
And make yourself at home  
In my house  
  
Because these days it's the money the money  
The money, honey, or your life  
I said don't you know you can't have both  
  
Stop acting so dumb  
The moment will come  
I will find someone like you  
Something extra, (always happens baby to me) sorry baby  
I don't know why (something)  
Said I don't know why that is  
  
You may want to strip again  
You may want to let me in  
You may want to sacrifice  
More than you think is fair or right  
  
You may want to think again  
You may want to watch your friends  
You may want to change your mind  
You may wish you could turn back time.

My daddy got here on the gravy train  
I guess my mama had a real bad start to the game  
They went walking and she took his name  
Round here  
  
There was dancing in the afternoons those days  
Waiting tables, chasing girls with the money he made  
It was 1957, and love felt the same, love felt the same  
  
Frightened little girl, she makes a break  
Into the arms of, something better  
Round here  
  
I hear my mama call in Kingsbury Park  
Just me and David and a football that glowed in the dark  
Waiting patiently to make my mark  
Round here  
  
And I remember my first day at school  
And I remember trouble, and thinking I was so cool  
I remember it all, like yesterday  
  
Don't you  
  
Every time I try to leave this place  
Something inside says, "You can do better"  
Round here  
  
So come with me, let me show you where I've lived  
I want to put my hands in this earth again  
Music fell like rain to the streets  
The Specials and The Jam, to The Beat  
Even though I think I've seen everything there is to see of this world  
I gotta be thankful that this crowded space  
Is the place of my birth  
  
When all that I wanted, was to be someone.  
  
Two little Hitlers in an old church hall  
Some cheesy covers and those neighbors that banged on the walls  
Andy says it's time to show them all  
Round here  
  
Please sir, we two have other plans  
Please sir you would not understand,  
What's going on  
Is magical, can't you see  
That some of us do more than dream  
  
Every time I try to leave this place  
Something inside says, "Keep on keeping, on and on...."  
Around here  
  
So come with me, let me show you where I've lived  
I want to put my hands in this earth again  
Music fell like rain to the streets  
The Specials and The Jam, ABC  
Even though I think I've seen everything there is to see of this world  
I gotta be thankful that this crowded space  
Is the place of my birth  
  
My birth,  
In this town,  
Yes I guess I got to be someone  
  
To be somebody  
In the Beautiful city  
  
This place I call home  
These streets of London  
It's everything I know (everything and everybody)  
On the streets of London  
I want to thank you  
  
My daddy got here on the gravy train.

Roxanne  
You don't have to put on the red light  
Those days are over  
You don't have to sell your body to the night  
Roxanne  
You don't have to wear that dress tonight  
Walk the streets for money  
You don't care if it's wrong or if it's right  
Roxanne  
You don't have to put on the red light  
Roxanne  
You don't have to  
I loved you since I knew ya  
I wouldn't talk down to ya  
I have to tell you just how I feel  
I won't share you with another boy  
I know my mind is made up  
So put away your make up  
I told you once I won't tell you again  
It's a bad way  
Roxanne  
You don't have to put on the red light  
Roxanne  
You don't have to  
Baby don't put it on  
Baby don't put it on  
Baby don't put it on  
Baby don't put it on  

Sweet thing  
I know how strong I can appear  
But your don't know the days  
Since somebody loved me  
You came  
And led me through that door again  
You say you want to stay  
But you don't know me (no you don't)  
  
You make me feel safe  
  
Someday  
My darkest fears will find their way  
After all  
Somebody loves me  
All day  
My heart tells strangers how I feel  
And it's hard not to feel this way  
When you thought your future was on prescription  
  
You make me feel safe

Once I had a secret love  
That lived within the heart of me  
All too soon my secret love  
Became impatient to be free  
  
So I told a friendly star  
The way that dreamers often do  
Just how wonderful you are  
And why I'm so in love with you  
  
Now I shout it from the highest hill  
I even told you the golden dafodill  
At least my heart's an open door  
And my secret love's no secret anymore  
  
Now I shout it from the highest hill  
I even told you the golden dafodill  
At least my heart's an open door  
And my secret love's no secret  
My secret love's no secret  
My secret love's no secret anymore

Oh, baby now let's get down tonight  
Ooh baby, I'm hot just like an oven  
I need some lovin'  
And baby, I can't hold it much longer  
It's getting stronger and stronger  
And when I get that feeling  
I want sexual healing  
Sexual healing, oh baby  
Makes me feel so fine  
Helps to relieve my mind  
Sexual healing baby, is good for me  
Sexual healing is something that's good for me  
Whenever blue teardrops are fallin'  
And my emotional stability is leaving me  
There is something I can do  
I can get on the telephone and call you up baby  
And honey I know you'll be there to relieve me  
The love you give to me will free me  
If you don't know the thing you're dealing  
Ohh I can tell you, darling, that it's sexual healing  
Get up, get up, get up, get up  
Let's make love tonight  
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up  
'cause you do it right  
Baby, I got sick this mornin'  
A sea was stormin' inside of me  
Baby, I think I'm capsizin'  
The waves are risin' and risin'  
And when I get that feeling  
I want sexual healing  
Sexual healing is good for me  
Makes me feel so fine, it's such a rush  
Helps to relieve the mind, and it's good for us  
Sexual healing, baby, it's good for me  
Sexual healing is something that's good for me  
Well, it's good for me and it's so good to me my baby, ohh  
Come take control, just grab a hold  
Of my body and mind, soon we'll be making it, honey  
I'll be feeling fine, the way you heal me  
The way you thrill me, keep me comin' to you  
For you to sexually fulfill me  
You're my medicine, open up and let me in  
Darling, you're so great, I can't wait for you to operate  
I can't wait for you to operate, baby  
I can't wait for you to operate  
And baby, when I should be asleep at night  
I stay up and read  
And baby, baby, baby, I can't help but feel uptight  
For my passion needs  
And when I get this feeling  
I want sexual healing  
When I get this feeling  
I want sexual healing  
Baby, I can't stand it much longer  
It's getting stronger and stronger  
And when I get this feeling  
I need sexual healing  
Ohh, when I get this feeling  
I need sexual healing  
I gotta have sexual healing, darling  
'cause I'm all alone  
And I need sexual healing, darling  
Till you come back home

Can anybody find me somebody to love  
Ooh, each morning I get up I die a little  
Can barely stand on my feet  
(Take a look at yourself) Take a look in the mirror and cry (and cry)  
Lord what you're doing to me (yeah yeah)  
I have spent all my years in believing you  
But I just can't get no relief, Lord!  
Somebody (somebody) ooh somebody (somebody)  
Can anybody find me somebody to love ?  
  
Yeah  
I work hard (he works hard) every day of my life  
I work till I ache in my bones  
At the end (at the end of the day)  
I take home my hard earned pay all on my own  
I get down (down) on my knees (knees)  
And I start to pray  
Till the tears run down from my eyes  
Lord somebody (somebody), ooh somebody  
(Please) Can anybody find me somebody to love ?  
  
(He works hard)  
Everyday (everyday) - I try and I try and I try  
But everybody wants to put me down  
They say I'm going crazy  
They say I got a lot of water in my brain  
Ah, got no common sense  
I got nobody left to believe in  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
Oh Lord  
Ooh somebody - ooh somebody  
Can anybody find me somebody to love ?  
(Can anybody find me someone to love)  
  
Got no feel, I got no rhythm  
I just keep losing my beat (You just keep losing and losing)  
I'm OK, I'm alright (he's alright - he's alright)  
I ain't gonna face no defeat (yeah yeah)  
I just gotta get out of this prison cell  
One day (someday) I'm gonna be free, Lord!  
  
Find me somebody to love

Anybody, anywhere, anybody find me somebody to love love love!  
Wooo somebody find me, find me love.

If you've got something to say  
Why don't you say it  
If you've got something to give  
Why don't you give it to me  
Day after day I have to say it  
We're moving further from heaven  
And closer to the deep blue sea  
  
Cause I have no secrets from you  
And I have nothing left to hide  
And I'm open to all of your questions  
Why can't you reach inside  
Like I have  
Like I have for you  
  
And all these games that you play  
Don't tell me how a man should be  
Some would say if you knew  
You wouldn't be here with me  
I Love you  
I still love you  
But I guess it's time to let you be  
  
Cause I have no secrets from you  
And I have nothing left to hide  
and I'm so tired of all these questions  
Cause maybe you just changed your mind  
Like I have  
Like I have  
Like I have  
Like I have  
  
When I was at your doorstep  
You told me to look around  
Said come in  
You and your heart sit down  
But you better watch your step  
Cause your not far from the ground  
And one fine day this all falls down  
Like I have  
Like I have  
  
If you got something to say  
Why don't you say it  
If you've got something to give  
Why don't you give it to me  
Day after day I have to say it  
If we've got something to save  
Why don't we save it

Higher, higher  
Won't you come with me  
Baby gonna get my soul free  
  
Now you and me  
I guess we see things differently  
We're night and day  
A bad connection some would say  
And I don't want nothing to change  
I don't want nothing to change  
Because  
When you touch me baby  
I don't have no choice  
Oh that sweet temptation  
In your voice  
  
Higher, higher  
Won't you come with me  
Baby gonna get my soul free  
  
Now seems to me  
Some things have just got to be  
The games we play  
Break-up make-up day by day  
And I don't want nothing to change  
I don't want nothing to change  
Because  
When you touch me baby  
I don't have no choice  
Oh that sweet temptation  
In your voice  
  
Higher, higher  
Won't you come with me  
Baby gonna get my soul free

Star people  
Counting your money till you soul turns green  
Star people  
Counting the cost of your desire to be seen  
  
I do not count myself among you  
I may be living in a dream  
It's just seem to many of you  
Can't help but hope  
There's a difference between, you and me  
  
You're a star  
(I'm talking to you)  
You're a star  
  
Maybe your mama gave you up boy  
(It's the same old same old)  
Maybe your daddy didn't love you enough girl  
  
Star people  
Never forget your secret safe with me  
Just look at all wonderful people  
Trying to forget they had to pay for what you see  
  
It's a dream  
With a nightmare stuck in the middle  
But where would you be  
Without all of that attention  
You'd die  
I'd die  
We'd die wouldn't we  
(Well wouldn't we)  
  
Big, big star  
Should go far  
  
Talk about your mother  
Talk about your father  
Talk about the people  
Who have made you what you are  
Talk about your teacher  
The bully boy who beat you  
Talk about the people who have paid  
For that new sports car  
  
Did you get off on a bad foot, baby  
Do you have a little tale to tell  
Is that why you're a star?  
Is that what makes a star?  
Nothing comes for nothing, baby  
That fame and fortune's heaven sent  
And who gives a fuck about your problems, darling  
When you can pay the rent  
  
How much is enough?

The first time ever I saw your face  
I thought the sun rose in your eyes  
The moon and the stars were the gifts you gave  
To the dark and empty skies, my love  
To the dark and empty skies  
  
And the first time ever I kissed your mouth  
I felt the earth move in my hands  
Like the trembling heart of a captive bird  
That was there at my command, my love  
That was there  
  
And the first time ever I lay with you  
And felt you heart so close to mine,  
And I knew our joy would fill the earth  
It would last till the end of time, my love  
It would last till the end of time  
The first time ever I saw your face  
Your face, your face

The grave that they dug him had flowers  
Gathered from the hillsides in bright summer colors  
And the brown earth bleached white at the edge of his gravestone  
He's gone  
When the wars of our nation did beckon  
A man barely twenty did answer the calling  
Proud of the trust that he placed in our nation  
He's gone  
But eternity knows him, and it knows what we've done  
And the rain fell like pearls on the leaves of the flowers  
Leaving brown, muddy clay where the earth had been dry  
And deep in the trench he waited for hours  
As he held to his rifle and prayed not to die  
But the silence of night was shattered by fire  
As guns and grenades blasted sharp through the air  
And one after another his comrades were slaughtered  
In morgue of Marines, alone standing there  
He crouched ever lower, ever lower with fear  
"They can't let me die! The can't let me die here!  
I'll cover myself with the mud and the earth  
I'll cover myself! I know I'm not brave!  
The earth! the earth! the earth is my grave"  
When the wars of our nation did beckon  
A man barely twenty did answer the calling  
Proud of the trust that he placed in our nation  
He's gone

The long and winding road that leads to your door,  
Will never disappear,  
I've seen that road before It always leads me here,  
Leads me to your door.  
  
The wild and windy night the rain washed away,  
Has left a pool of tears crying for the day.  
Why leave me standing here, let me know the way  
  
Many times I've been alone and many times I've cried  
Anyway you'll never know the many ways I've tried, but  
Still they lead me back to the long and winding road  
You left me standing here a long, long time ago  
Don't leave me waiting here, lead me to you door

Take my life  
Time has been twisting the knife  
I don't recognize  
People I care for  
  
Take my dreams  
Childish and weak at the seams  
Please don't analyze  
Please just be there for me  
  
The things that I know  
Nobody told me  
The seeds that are sown  
They still control me  
There's a liar in my head  
There's a thief upon my bed  
And the strangest thing  
Is I cannot seem to get my eyes open  
  
Take my hand  
Lead me to some peaceful land  
That I cannot find  
Inside my head  
  
Wake me with love  
It's all I need  
But in all this time  
Still no one said  
  
If I had not asked  
Would you have told me  
If you call this love  
Why don't you hold me  
  
There's a liar in my head  
There's a thief upon my bed  
And the strangest thing  
Is I cannot seem to get my eyes open  
  
Give me something I can hold  
Give me something to believe in  
I am frightened for my soul, please, please  
Make love to me, send love through me  
Heal me with your crime  
The only one who ever knew me,  
We've wasted so much time  
So much time

Sometimes I get the feelin'  
I was back in the old days-long ago  
When we were kids, when we were young  
Things seemed so perfect-you know?  
Thedays were endless, we were crazy-we were young  
The sun was always shinin'-we just lived for fun  
Sometimes ot seems like lately-I don't know  
The rest of my life's been-just a show  
  
Those were the days of our lives  
The bad things in life were so few  
Those days are all gone now but one thing is true-  
When I look and find, I still love you  
  
You can't turn back the clock,  
You can't turn back the tide  
Ain't that a shame? (ain't that a shame?)  
I'd like to go back one time on a roller coaster ride  
When life was just a game  
No use sitting and thinkin' on what you did  
When you can lay back and enjoy it through your kids  
Sometimes it seems like lately I just don't know  
Better sit back and go-with the flow  
  
'cause these are the days of our lives  
They've flown in the swiftness of time  
These days are all gone now but some things remain  
When I look and I find-no change  
  
Those were the days of our lives  
The bad things in life were so few  
Those days are all gone now but one thing is true-  
When I look and find, I still love you  
  
I still love you  
I love you  
I still love you  
I still love you  
I still love you  
Still love you

No more lying friends  
Wanting tragic ends  
Though they do pretend  
They won't go when I go  
  
All those bleeding hearts  
With sorrows to impart  
Were right here from the start  
And they won't go when I go  
  
And I'll go where I've longed  
To go so long  
Away from tears  
  
Gone from painful cries  
Away from saddened eyes  
Along with them I'll bide  
Because they won't go when I go  
  
Big men feeling small  
Weak ones standing tall  
I will watch them fall  
They won't go when I go  
  
And I'll go where I've long  
To go so long  
Away from tears  
  
Unclean minds mislead the pure  
The innocent will leave for sure  
For them there is a resting place  
People sinning just for fun  
They will never see the sun  
For they can never show their faces  
There ain't no room for the hopeless sinner  
Who will take more then he will give  
He ain't hardly gonna give  
  
The greed of man will be  
Far away from me  
And my soul will be free  
They won't go when I go  
  
Since my soul conceived  
All that I believe  
The kingdom I will see  
'cause they won't go when I go  
  
When I go  
Where I'll go  
No one can keep me  
From my destiny

Don't kiss me, darling  
I want you to hear the things I say  
I loved you in my way  
But you know I'm gonna leave you  
  
The clock was always ticking  
And your heart,  
Yes I know your heart is always on the run  
  
I hate what I've become  
But I'm still gonna leave you  
And I don't think you should stay for the night  
  
Baby you know that my flesh is weak  
You know I simply  
  
I cannot sleep without you  
My heart has simply nowhere to go  
  
Nothing to hold  
Those tears you're crying  
  
Time and time again you take me back in baby  
  
You don't have to make it plain  
  
This is not real love  
  
Look at us dancing baby  
Let's dance and show them all  
(Dance and show them all)  
How close we are  
The lies have worked so far  
So we go on deceiving  
  
But darling don't you know the time  
Baby, look at yourself, holding back the tide  
Like you've got something else up your sleeve  
That's why I've got to leave  
  
And I don't think you should stay here tonight  
(Baby don't you know that my flesh is weak, you know)  
I simply I cannot sleep without you  
But someday I'll have nothing to show  
(Nothing to show)  
(Nothing to show)  
I've nothing to hold  
  
Oh, baby, crying  
All those simple things that won't come again  
Oh do I have to make it plain  
This is not real love  
And I said this is not real love  
  
Real love  
Baby it don't glisten and shine the way it used to  
  
This is not real love (real love)  
Baby think of all the promises I made on the day that I seduced you  
Baby don't wait for me like some angel of tragedy  
I have to set you free  
Darling you should be long gone, oh long gone by now  
You should be with someone, someone  
  
Glisten and shine  
You promised me  
  
You've gotta face it woman, you ain't ever gonna change me  
  
Where will I go, what do I know  
About life without you  
You promised me you'd never leave me, no  
This is not real love

Is that enough?  
I think it's over  
See, everything has changed  
And all this hatred may just make me strong enough  
To walk away  
  
They may chase me to the ends of the earth  
But I've got you babe  
And they may strip me of the things that I've worked for  
But I've had my say  
  
So hear me now  
I've enough of these chains  
I know they're of my making  
No one else to blame for where I stand today  
I've no memory of truth  
But suddenly the audience is so cruel  
So God, hey God you know why I'm through  
  
Through  
  
I guess it's tough, I guess I'm older  
And everything must change  
But all this cruelty and money instead of love  
People, have we no shame?  
  
They may chase me to the ends of the earth  
But I've got you babe  
And they may take away the things that I've worked for  
But you'll pull me through  
  
It's so clear to me now  
I've enough of these chains  
Life is there for the taking  
What kind of fool would remain in this cheap gilded cage  
I've no memory of truth  
But suddenly the audience is so cruel  
Oh God, I'm sorry  
  
I think I'm through  
I think I'm through  
I think I'm, I know I'm

Hey, you're just too funky for me,  
I gotta get inside of you,  
And I'll show you heaven if you let me.  
Hey you're just too funky for me,  
I gotta get inside, (I gotta get inside)  
I gotta get inside of you (So when will that be?).  
I watch you're fingers working overtime (Overtime),  
I've got to thinking that they should be mine. Oh!  
I'd love to see you naked baby,  
I'd like to think that sometime maybe  
Tonight, if that's alright. Yeah!  
  
Hey, you're just too funky for me,  
I gotta get inside of you, (Won't let you go)  
I won't let you, no-no  
Hey you're just too funky for me,  
I gotta get inside, (I gotta get inside)  
I gotta get inside of you (I'll let you love me).  
I watch you drinkin' and I take my time,  
I watch you sinkin' all over that cheap red wine, Oh!  
I've got to see you naked baby,  
I'd like to think that sometime maybe,  
Tonight my goal's in sight, Yeah!  
  
Baby, baby, baby, why do you do this to me?  
Won't let you go, (Won't let you go)  
You're such a, you're such a  
Baby, baby, baby, why do you do this to me?  
I've got to know. (I've got to know)  
(I'm gonna be the kind of lover that you never had)  
Hey you're just too funky.  
(You're never gonna have another lover in your bed)  
You're just too funky for me.  
  
(Would you like me to seduce you, is that what you're trying to tell me?)  
(Everybody wants a lover like that)  
Baby  
(Everybody wants a lover like that) Yeah! Yeah!  
(Everybody wants a lover like that) Everybody, everybody  
(Everybody wants a lover like that)  
(Is that what you are trying to tell me?)  
(Everybody wants a lover, everybody wants a lover like that.  
Everybody wants a lover, everybody wants a lover like that.  
Everybody wants a lover, everybody wants a lover like that.  
Everybody wants a lover, everybody wants a lover like that.  
(Would you like me to seduce you?)  
You're such a, you're such a  
(Would you like me to seduce you?) Yeah! Yeah!  
(Would you like me to seduce you?) You're such a, you're such a.  
Yeah! Yeah!  
(Would you stop playing with that radio of yours, I'm trying to get to  
Sleep! )

I feel so extraordinary  
Something's got a hold on me  
I get this feeling I'm in motion  
A sudden sense, a sense of liberty  
I don't care 'cause I'm not there  
I don't care if I'm here tomorrow  
Again and again and again I've taken too much  
Of the things that cost you too much  
  
I used to think that the day would never come  
I'd see the light in the shade of the morning sun  
But don't you know something's really got a hold on me  
My morning sun is the drug that brings me near  
To the childhood I lost replaced by fear  
  
When I was a very small boy  
Very small boys would talk to me  
Now that we've grown up together  
Can you believe?  
They're afraid of what they see  
That's the price that we all pay  
Our valued destiny has come to nothing  
I can't tell you where we're going  
I guess there's just no way of knowing  
  
I used to think that the day would never come  
I'd see the light in the shade of the morning sun  
My morning sun is the drug that brings me near  
To the childhood I lost replaced by fear  
(Something's got a hold on me)  
My morning sun is the drug that brings me near  
To the childhood I lost replaced by fear  
  
Oh and I know and I know I know it's just so bitter  
And it's so wrong, it's so wrong  
Oh I know and I know but I I I have a question  
Big fuckin' question  
  
I'm in motion, motion  
I'm in motion, I have a question  
And I'm in motion, motion  
I have a question, motion  
I have a question

Would you like to go with me  
Down my dead end street  
Would you like to come with me  
To Village Ghetto Land  
  
See the people lock their doors  
While robbers laugh and steal  
Beggars watch and eat their meal -- from garbage cans  
  
Broken glass is everywhere  
It's a bloody scene  
Killing plauges the citizens  
Unless they own police  
  
Children play with rusted cars  
Sores cover their hands  
Politicians laugh ad drink -- drunk to all demands  
  
Families buying dog food now  
Starvation roams the streets  
Babies die before they're born  
Infected by the grief  
  
Now some folks say that we should be  
Glad for what we have  
Tell me would you be happy in Village Ghetto Land  
  
Village Ghetto Land

Well there ain't no point in moving on  
Until you've got somewhere to go  
And the road that I have walked upon  
Well it filled my pockets  
And emptied out my soul  
  
All those insecurities  
That have held me down for so long  
I can't say I've found a cure for these  
But at least I know them  
So they're not so strong  
  
You look for your dreams in heaven  
But what the hell are you supposed to do  
When they come true?  
  
Well there's one year of my life in the songs  
And some of them are about you  
Now I know there's no way I can write those wrongs  
Believe me  
I would not lie you've hurt my pride  
And I guess there's a road without you  
  
But you once said  
There's a way back for every man  
So here I am  
Don't people change, here I am  
Is it too late to try again  
(return to top)

"Now everyday I see you in some other face  
They crack a smile, talk a while,  
Try to take your place  
My memories serve me far too well  
It's not like at all  
We just broke up  
It's not like at all  
It was yesterday  
But something I just can't explain  
Something  
And no one ever saw your face again  
Just say good bye to the stupid mistakes we made  
My memories serve me far too well  
The years will come and go  
Some of them will change our lives  
Some of us still have nothing to show  
nothing baby  
But memories  
And I just wish to see your face again  
Won't you keep waiting for that day?  
I know I know I know  
You hear these words that I say  
You can't always get what you want  
You can't always get what you want

Jitterbug  
Jitterbug  
Jitterbug  
You put the boom boom into my heart  
  
You send my soul sky high  
When your loving starts  
Jitterbug into my brain goes a' bang bang bang till my feet do the same  
If somethings bugging you  
If something ain't right  
  
My best friend told me what you did last night  
Left me sheeting in my bed I was dreaming  
  
But I should have been with you instead  
  
[Chorus]  
Wake me up before you go-go  
Don't leave me hanging on like a yo-yo  
Wake me up before you go-go  
I don't wanna miss it when you hit that high  
Wake me up before you go-go  
Cause I'm not planning on going solo  
Wake me up before you go-go  
Take me dancing tonight  
I wanna hit that high  
Yeah  
Yeah  
  
You put the grey skies outta my way  
  
You make the sun shine brighter than Doris Day.  
You turn a bright spark into a flame  
  
My beats per minute never been the same  
  
Cause you're my lady  
I'm your fool  
It makes me crazy  
  
When you act so cruel  
Come on baby  
Lets not fight  
We'll go dancing  
Everything will be alright  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Cuddle up baby  
Move in tight well go  
Dancing tomorrow night  
It's cold out there  
But 'it's warm in bed  
They can dance  
We'll stay home instead...  
  
Jitterbug  
  
[Chorus: x2]

(I'm here if you see me)  
She's got a song in her head and she'll sing to me  
She's got a laugh that reminds me of why she's in love with me  
She'd never let show she was lonely in case it had frightened me  
She was carpet and stone, independent, alone  
But this love always shone around me every time, oh  
  
Waltz away dreaming till your day begins again  
Free from the seasons and this state I'm in  
And oh, I can't hold it all under one love  
It was so long ago when we danced in the streets  
Now you fly like an eagle above while I waltz away anyway  
And I'm waltzing my days away  
Searching for this woman I love  
  
(I'm here if you see me)  
She had a history, joy and pain, and she chose to leave  
She had a thousand and one photographs that you would not believe  
She'll come to you in disguise, she's there in you children's eyes  
Still our mother, she's still your wife  
So let her  
  
Waltz away dreaming till your day begins again, oh yeah  
Free from the reasons and this state I'm in  
And oh,(trust me) I can't hold it all  
(she ain't going anywhere) under one love  
(trust me, she told me, when you're ready she'll be there)  
It was so long ago (no, don't let go of her)  
When we kissed in the streets  
Now you fly like an eagle above while I waltz away anyway  
Then I'm waltzing my days away  
Searching for this woman I love  
  
(and the moment you see me, I will live in your life)  
(we will walk through my garden, I will see through you eyes)  
Waltzing my days away (and the moment)  
I was in despair (you see me) till she found me there (I will live)  
Every grown man cries (in your life) with his mother's eyes  
(we will walk) when you're ready too (through my garden)  
She'll come back to you (I will see through your eyes)  
Waltzing my days away (and the moment) she's waiting  
(you see me, I will live in your life)  
Waltzing my days (we will walk) she's waiting  
(through my garden, I will) father (see through your eyes)  
She's waiting (and the moment you see me)

Chorus:  
Wham! Bam!  
I am! A man!  
Job or no job,  
You can't tell me that I'm not.  
Do! You!  
Enjoy what you do?  
If not, just stop!  
Don't stay there and rot!  
  
You got soul....  
You got soul....  
I said get, get, get on down,  
Said get, get, get, on down.  
Hey everybody take a look at me,  
I've got street credibility,  
I may not have a job,  
But I have a good time,  
With the boys that I meet "down on the line"  
I said, I - don't - need - you  
So you don't approve,  
Well who asked you to?  
Hey - jerk - you - work  
This boy's got better things to do  
Hell,  
I ain't never gonna work, get down in the dirt,  
I choose, to cruise.  
Gonna live my life, sharp as a knife,  
I've found my groove and I just can't lose.  
A. 1. Style from head to toe,  
Cool cat flash gonna let you know,  
I'm a soul boy - I'm a dole boy,  
Take pleasure in leisure, I believe in joy!  
  
Chorus  
  
Party nights, and neon lights,  
We hit the floors, we hit the heights.  
Dancing shoes, and pretty girls.  
Boys in leather kiss girls in pearls!  
Hot-damn! Everybody, let's play!  
So they promised you a good job - no way!  
  
One, two, three, rap!  
C'mon everybody, don't need this crap!  
  
Chorus  
  
If you're a pub man  
Or a club man  
Maybe a jet black guy with a hip hi-fi  
A white cool cat with a trilby hat  
Maybe leather and studs is where you're at  
Make the most of every day  
Don't let hard times stand in your way  
Give a wham give a bam but don't give a damn  
Cos the benefit gang are gonna pay!  
  
Now reach up high and touch your soul,  
The boys from wham! Will help you reach that goal.  
It's gonna break your mama's heart, (so sad)  
It's gonna break your daddy's heart, (too bad)  
But you'll throw the dice and take my advice,  
Because I know that you're smart.  
Can you dig this thing? - yeah!  
Are you gonna get down? - yeah!  
Say wham! - wham!  
Say bam! - bam!  
  
Chorus  
  
Do you want to work? - no  
Are you gonna have fun? - yeah  
Said one, two, three, rap, c'mon everybody,  
Don't need this crap!  
Enjoy what you do?  
Everybody say wham! - wham!  
Everybody say wham! Bam! - wham! Bam!  
Enjoy what you do?

When you wish upon a star  
Makes no difference who you are  
Anything your heart desires  
Will come to you  
  
If your heart is in your dreams  
No request is to extreme  
When you wish upon a star  
As dreamers do  
  
Fate is kind  
She brings to those who love  
As sweet fullfillment of their secret drowns  
Like a boat out of the blue  
Fate steps in and see's you through  
  
Moma when you wished upon a star  
Your dreams come true  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
Fate is kind  
She brings to those who love  
As sweet fullfillment of their secret drowns  
Like a boat out of the blue  
Fate steps in and see's you through  
  
Baby when you wish upon a star  
Your dreams come true  
When you wished upon a star  
Makes no difference who you are  
Your dreams come true

I spend my nights down on the wharf  
In unlit alleyways  
By the church downtown  
Where Sally prays  
Come down sometime  
We'll share a rusty can of corn...  
And listen to the radio  
I love you, I love you, it says...  
  
Chorus:  
Where did your heart go  
Did you put it on a train  
Did you leave it in the rain  
Or down in Mexico  
  
You cry, but I don't know  
I've heard it all before  
There it goes again, the slamming of the door  
Sometimes the river calls me  
And at night it calls my name  
Says "put your troubles down beside me"  
Things have always been the same...  
And rock 'n' roll won't teach me  
What the river said that night  
I jumped into this beauty  
And drifted out of sight...  
  
Chorus

When you're awake  
The things you think  
Come from the dreams you dream  
Thought has wings,  
And lots of things  
Are seldom what they see  
Sometimes you think you've lived before  
All that you live today  
Things you do come back to you  
As though they knew the way  
Oh, the tricks your mind can play  
  
It seems we stood and talked like this before  
We looked at each other in the same way then  
But I can't remember where or when  
The clothes you're wearing and the clothes you wore  
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then  
But I can't remember where or when  
Some things that happen for the first time  
Seem to be happening again  
And so it seems that we have met before  
And laughed before  
And loved before  
But who knows where or when  
  
It seems we stood and talked like this before  
We looked at each other in the same way then  
But I can't remember where or when  
The clothes you're wearing and the clothes you wore  
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then  
But I can't remember where or when  
Some things that happen for the first time  
Seem to be happening again  
And so it seems that we have met before  
And laughed before  
And loved before  
But who knows where or when

Love me, love me, love me, love me  
Say you do  
Let me fly away with you  
For my love is like the wind  
And wild is the wind  
  
Give me more than one caress  
Satisfy this hungriness  
Let the wind blow through your heart  
Oh wild is the wind  
  
You touch me  
I hear the sound of mandolins  
You kiss me  
With your kiss my life begins  
You're spring to me  
All things to me  
You're life itself!  
  
Like the leaf  
Clings to the tree  
Oh my darling cling to me  
For we're like creatures of the wind  
And wild is the wind

Duet with Elton John  
  
There are ladies, illegal X's  
Mona Lisa's, well connected  
They may be shady, English roses  
Blue blooded, turned up noses  
  
Money talks, see what it catches  
Postage paid, no strings attached  
She's a honey, she's a tramp  
Roaring twenties, molls and vamps  
  
Wrap her up, I'll take her home with me  
Wrap her up, she is all I need  
Wrap her up, I only get one chance  
Beasts and beauties, but they all can dance  
  
Wrap her up, I'll taker her home with me  
Wrap her up, she is all I need  
Wrap her up  
Give her to me, wrap her up  
  
Is she foreign, legs eleven  
Italian girls, take me to heaven  
You pretty babies, from Paris, France  
Crazy horses, love to dance

Here we are on earth together,  
It's you and I,  
God has made us fall in love, it's true,  
I've really found someone like you  
  
Will it say the love you feel for me, will it say,  
That you will be by my side  
To see me through,  
Until my life is through  
  
Well, in my mind, we can conquer the world,  
In love you and I, you and I, you and I  
  
I am glad at least in my life I found someone  
That may not be here forever to see me through,  
But I found strength in you,  
I only pray that I have shown you a brighter day,  
Because that's all that I am living for, you see,  
Don't worry what happens to me  
  
Cause' in my mind, you will stay here always,  
In love, you and I, you and I, you and I, you and I  
In my mind we can conquer the world  
In love, you and I, you and I, you and I
