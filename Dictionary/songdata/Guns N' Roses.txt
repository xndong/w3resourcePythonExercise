I've been thinkin' 'bout  
Thinkin' 'bout sex  
Always hungry for somethin'  
That I haven't had yet  
Well maybe baby, you got somethin' to lose  
Well I got somethin'  
I got somethin' for you  
  
My way, your way  
Anything goes tonight  
My way, your way  
Anything goes  
  
Panties round your knees  
With your ass in debris  
Doing that grind  
With a push and a squeeze  
Tied up, tied down  
Up against the wall  
Be my rubbermade baby  
And we can do it all  
  
My way, your way  
Anything goes tonight

Yeah!  
Attitude  
Some fuckin' attitude  
I can't believe what you say to me  
You've got some attitude  
  
Inside that bitter brain  
There's gotta be a whore  
If you don't shut your mouth  
You're gonna feel the floor, yeah!  
  
Attitude, what you've got  
Some fuckin' attitude  
Attitude's what you've got  
Some fuckin' attitude

If you don't shut your mouth  
You're gonna feel the mutha fuckin' guitar!  
  
Oh, attitude  
Some fuckin' attitude  
I can't believe what you say to me  
You've got some attitude

You've got some attitude  
  
Yeah!  
Yeah!  
Yeah! yeh!

I can't stop thinkin'  
Thinking 'bout sinkin'  
Sinkin' down into my bed  
I call my mother  
She's just a cunt now  
She said I'm sick in the head  
She said you ain't special  
So who you foolin'  
Don't try ta give me a line  
But I can't stop thinkin' 'bout  
Seein' ya one more time  
(Oh no)  
But I already left you  
And you're better off left behind  
  
It's a bad obsession  
It's always messin'  
It's always messin' my mind  
It's a bad obsession  
It's always messin'  
It's always messin' my mind  
  
Too bad you're fucked up  
  
I used to be wasted  
Always tried to take it  
Take it down into my vein  
I call the doctor  
He's just another  
He said I'm sick in the brain  
He said you ain't special  
So who you foolin'  
Don't try ta give me a line  
But I can't stop thinkin' 'bout  
Doin' it one more time  
(Oh no)  
But I already left you  
And you're better off left behind  
(Oh yeah)  
  
Aw it's a bad obsession  
It's always messin'  
It's always messin' my mind  
It's a bad obsession  
It's always messin'  
It's always messin' my mind  
  
So bad...  
  
Boy

Heads up

It's always messin'  
It's always messin' my mind  
Now it's a bad obsession  
It's always messin'  
It's always messin' my mind  
  
But I can't stop thinkin' 'bout  
Doin' it one more time  
(Oh no)  
See I already left you  
And you're better off left behind  
(Oh no, oh no)  
It's a bad obsession  
And you're always messin' my mind  
See I already left you  
And you're better off left behind  
Uh huh...no  
  
Maybe you'll do better next time  
Punk!!

No one ever told me when I was alone  
They just thought I'd know better, better.  
  
No one ever told me when I was alone  
They just thought I'd know better, better.  
  
The hardest part this troubled heart has never  
Yet been through now.  
We've healed the scars that got their start  
Inside someone like you now.  
  
Well had I known or I'd been shown back  
When I longed you'd take me.  
To break the charge that brought me home  
And all that won't erase me.  
  
I never would know that I could  
No matter what you'd pay me.  
Replay the part, you stole my heart  
I should have known you're crazy.  
  
If all I knew was that with you  
I'd want someone to save me.  
It'd be enough, but just my luck,  
I fell in love and baby all that I wanted was  
  
Now I know you better,  
You know I'd know better,  
Now I know you better!  
  
So bittersweet, this tragedy won't ask for absolution,  
This melody inside of me still searches for solution,  
A twist of fate, a change of heart,  
Kills my infatuation,  
A broken heart, provides the spark for my determination,  
  
No one ever told me when I was alone,  
They just thought I'd know better, better.  
Ooh, no one ever told me when I was alone,  
They just thought I'd know better, better.

We all come in from the cold  
We come down from the wire  
An everybody warms themselves  
To a different fire  
When sometimes we get burned  
You'd think sometime we'd learn  
The one you love is the one  
That should take you higher  
You ain't got no one  
You better go back out and find her  
  
Just like children hidin' in a closet  
Can't tell what's goin' on outside  
Sometimes we're so far off the beaten track  
We'll get taken for a ride  
By a parlor trick or some words of wit  
A hidden hand up a sleeve  
To think the one you love  
Could hurt you now  
Is a little hard to believe  
But everybody darlin' sometimes  
Bites the hand that feeds  
  
When I look around  
Everybody always brings me down  
Well is it them or me  
Well I just can't see  
But there ain't no peace to found  
But if someone really cared  
Well they'd take the time to spare  
A moment to try and understand  
Another one's despair  
Remember in this game we call life  
That no one said it's fair  
  
Breakdown  
Let me hear it now  
Breakdown  
Let me hear it now  
Yeah  
Breakdown  
Let me hear it now  
Breakdown  
Let me hear it now  
Get down with yo' bad self  
Alright  
  
I've come to know the cold  
I think of it as home  
When there ain't enough of me  
To go around  
I'd rather be left alone  
But if I call you out of habit  
I'm out of love and I gotta have it  
Would you give it to me  
If I fit you needs  
Like when we both knew we had it  
But now the damage's done  
And we're back out on the run  
Fun how ev'rything was roses  
When we held on to the guns  
Just because you're winnin'  
Don't mean you're the lucky ones  
  
Breakdown  
Let me hear it now  
Breakdown  
Yeah  
Breakdown  
Breakdown  
Let me hear it now  
  
There goes the Challenger being chased  
By the blue blue meanies on wheels  
The vicious traffic squad cars are  
After our lone driver  
The last American hero  
The the electric sitar  
The demi-god  
The super driver of the golden west!  
Two nasty nazi cars are close behind  
The beautiful lone driver  
The police cars are getting closer-closer  
Closer to our soul hero in his soul mobile yeah baby!  
They about to strike, they gonna get him, smash! rape!  
The last beautiful free soul on this planet  
  
But it is written if the evil spirit  
Arms the tiger with claws  
Brahman provided wings for the dove  
Thus spake the super guru"  
"Did you hear that"

Buick, Buick Mackane will ya,  
Buick Mackane will ya be my girl?  
Oh, be my girl  
  
Rainy lady  
Queen of the rock will ya  
Queen of the rock will ya help me roll?  
Help me roll.  
  
Spoken: 'See my soul'  
  
Sire, Sire,  
You're just a sexual glider  
You're just a sexual glider  
Be my plane,  
Oh, in the rain  
  
Buick, Buick Mackane will ya,  
Buick Mackane will ya be my girl?  
Oh, be my girl  
  
I don't know what to do  
I'm gonna  
Funk, funk, funk, funk you  
Funk You, I said  
I don't know what to do  
I'm gonna  
Funk, funk, funk, funk you  
Funk You, I said  
I don't know what to do  
I'm gonna  
Funk, funk, funk, funk You, funk You

My child arrived just the other day  
Came to the world in the usual way  
But there were planes to catch and bills to pay  
He learned to walk while I was away  
He was talkin' 'fore I knew it  
And as he grew he said,  
I'm gonna be like you, Dad,  
You know I'm gonna be like you.  
  
Chorus  
And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon,  
Little boy blue and the man on the moon.  
When you comin' home? '  
'Son, I don't know when, but we'll get together then.  
You know we'll have a good time then. '  
  
My son turned ten just the other day.  
He said, 'Thanks for the ball, Dad. Come on, let's play.  
Can you teach me to throw? '  
I said, 'Not today. I got a lot to do. '  
He said, 'That's okay. '  
And then he walked away but the smile never dimmed and he said,  
'You know, I'm gonna be like him, yeah.  
You know I'm gonna be like him. '  
  
Chorus  
  
Well, he came from college just the other day,  
So much like a man, I just had to say,  
'Son, I'm proud of you. Can you sit for a while? '  
He shook his head and he said with a smile,  
'What I'd really like, Dad, is to borrow the car keys.  
See you later. Can I have them please? '  
  
Chorus  
  
I've long since retired, my son's moved away.  
I called him up just the other day.  
I said, 'i'd like to see you, if you don't mind. '  
He said, 'i'd love to, Dad, if I could find the time.  
You see my new job's a hassle and the kids have the flu,  
But it's sure nice talkin' to you, Dad.  
It's been sure nice talkin' to you. '  
And as I hung up the phone it occurred to me,  
He'd grown up just like me.  
My boy was just like me.  
  
Chorus

It don't really matter  
You'll find out for yourself  
No it don't really matter  
You're gonna leave this thing to  
Somebody else  
  
If they missionaries  
Real time visionaries  
Sitting in a Chinese school  
To view my dis-infatu-ation  
I know that I'm a classic case  
Watch my disenchanted face  
Blame it on the Falun Gong  
They've seen the end and you can't hold on now  
  
Cause it would take a lot more hate than you  
To stop the fascination  
Even with an iron fist  
Our baby got to rule the nation  
But all I got is precious time  
  
It don't really matter  
You're gonna find out for yourself  
No it don't really matter  
So you can hear now from  
Somebody else  
  
Cause it would take a lot more time than you  
I've got more masturbation  
Even with your iron fist  
More than you got to rule the nation  
But all I got is precious time  
More than you got to rule the nation  
But all I got is precious time  
  
It don't really matter  
Gonna keep it to myself  
No it don't really matter  
So you can hear it now from  
Somebody else  
  
You think you got it all locked up inside  
And if you beat them all up they'll die  
Then you'll walk them home for the cells  
Then now you'll dig for your road back to hell  
And with your ? makes you stop  
As if your eyes were their eyes you can tell  
In your lack of time

See you've caught me in a coma  
And I don't think I want to  
Ever come back to this  
World again  
Kinda like it in a coma  
'Cause no one's ever gonna  
Oh make me come back to this  
World again  
  
Now I feel as if I'm floating away  
I can't feel the pressure  
And I like it this way  
But my body's calling, my body's calling  
Want me to come back to this  
World again  
  
Suspended deep in a sea of black  
I got the light at the end  
I got the bones on the mast  
Well, I've gone sailing, I've gone sailing  
I could leave so easily  
My friends are calling back to me  
I said yeah,  
They're leaving it all up to me when  
All I needed was clarity  
And someone to tell me what the fuck is going on  
Goddammit  
  
Slippin' farther and farther away  
It's a miracle how long we can stay  
In a world our minds created  
In a world that's full of shit  
  
Please understand me  
I'm climbin' through the wreckage  
Of all my twisted dreams  
And this cheap investigation  
Just can't stifle all my screams  
And I'm waiting  
At the crossroads  
Waiting for you  
Waiting for you  
Where are you  
  
No one's gonna bother me anymore  
No one's gonna mess with my head no more  
I can't understand what all the fightin's for  
But it's so nice here down off the shore  
I wish you could see this  
Cause there's nothing to see  
It's peaceful here and its fine with me  
Not like the world where I used to live  
I never really wanted to live...  
  
Zap him again...  
Zap the son of a bitch again  
  
Live your life like it's a coma  
Won't you tell me why we'd want to  
With all the reasons you give  
It's kinda hard to believe  
  
But who am I to tell you that I've seen any reason  
Why you should stay  
Maybe we'd be better off without you anyway  
I got a one way ticket on your last chance ride  
Got a one way ticket to your suicide  
Got a one way ticket and there's no way out alive  
  
And all this crass communication that has left you in the cold  
Isn't much for consolation when you feel so weak and old  
But if home is where the heart is  
Then there's stories to be told  
No, you don't need a doctor  
No one else can heal your soul  
  
Got your mind in submission  
Got your life on the line  
But nobody pulled the trigger  
They just stepped aside  
They'll be down by the water  
While you watch 'em wavin' goodbye  
  
They'll be callin' in the morning  
They'll be hanging on the phone  
They'll be waitin' for an answer  
But you know nobody's home  
And when the bells stop ringing  
It was nobody's fault but your own  
  
There were always ample warning  
There were always subtle signs  
And you would have seen them coming  
But we gave you too much time  
And when you said that no one's listening  
Why'd your best friend drop a dime  
Sometimes we get so tired of waiting for a  
Way to spend our time  
  
And it's so easy to be social  
It's so easy to be cool  
Yeah, its easy to get hungry  
When you ain't got shit to lose  
And I wish that I could help you  
With what you hope to find  
But I'm still out here waiting  
Watching reruns of my life  
When you reach the point of breaking  
Know it's gonna take some time  
To heal those broken memories  
That another man would need  
Just to survive

Here come 'ol flatttop

Crash diet of reds'n'ludes  
A shot of vitamin C and a bottle of booze  
Too stupid to live with nothin' to lose  
In your one track mind now  
Where's that leave you?  
  
Drink'n'drive white lightning faster baby  
Takin' your last ride  
Now better be so careful or you'll be dead before you time  
Sorry you took mother's car now  
  
Tears in my eyes, baby please don't go  
You bet (?!) one too many, now one for the road  
Fresh outta detox, fresh from jail  
Took your rehabilitation and you drove me to hell  
  
Drink'n'drive white lightning faster  
Takin' your last ride  
Better be so careful or you'll be dead before your time  
Sorry you took mohter's car now  
  
Too soon, you thought... ?!  
Too late for the pressure and strain  
Too bad for those who don't believe it  
Ruby street still calls your name  
  
[guitar solo]  
  
Itchy trigger finger and the race to be alive  
Smokin' a cig while you drink'n'drive  
With no control in your life ahead  
You're never gonna see if you wind up dead  
  
Drink'n'drive white lightning faster  
Takin' your last ride  
Better be so careful or you'll be dead before your time  
Drink'n'drive white lightning baby  
It's always on your mind  
Push or pull your limits baby, do it one more time  
Break it down  
Break it down  
Somethin''s changin', somethin''s breakin'  
You gotta be a brother, 'coz?! Your family  
?!.... Oh make it  
Sweet mystery, Ooohhhh  
If you don't care about yourself  
Would you please leave me alive  
Oooohhhh...  
You gonna  
You gonna drink'n'drive  
Oooohhhhh, Yeeaaah!

Sick of this life  
Not that you'd care  
I'm not the only one with  
Whom these feelings I share  
  
Nobody understands,  
Quite why we're here  
We're searchin' for answers  
That never appear  
  
But maybe if I looked real hard I'd  
I'd see your tryin' too  
To understand this life,  
That we're all goin' through  
(Then when she said she was gonna like wreck my car...  
I didn't know what to do)  
  
Sometimes I feel like I'm beatin' a dead horse  
An I don't know why you'd be bringin' me down  
I'd like to think that our love's worth a tad more  
It may sound funny but you'd think by now  
I'd be smilin'  
I guess some things never change  
Never change  
  
I met an old cowboy  
I saw the look in his eyes  
Somethin' tells me he's been here before  
'Cause experience makes you wise  
I was only a small child  
When the thought first came to me  
That I'm a son of a gun and the gun of a son  
That brought back the devil in me  
  
Sometimes I feel like I'm beatin' a dead horse  
An I don't know why you'd be bringin' me down  
I'd like to think that our love's worth a tad more  
It may sound funny but you'd think by now  
I'd be smilin'  
I guess some things never change  
Never change  
  
I ain't quite what you'd call an old soul  
Still wet behind the ears  
I been around this track a couple o' times  
But now the dust is startin' to clear  
Oh yeah!!!  
  
Sometimes I feel like I'm beatin' a dead horse  
An I don't know why you'd be bringin' me down  
I'd like to think that our love's worth a tad more  
It may sound funny but you'd think by now  
I'd be smilin'  
Ooh yeah, I'd be smilin'  
No way I'd be smilin'  
Ooh smilin'

Talk to me softly  
There is something in your eyes  
Don't hang your head in sorrow  
And please don't cry  
I know how you feel inside I've  
I've been there before  
Something is changin' inside you  
And don't you know  
  
Don't you cry tonight  
I still love you baby  
Don't you cry tonight  
Don't you cry tonight  
There's a heaven above you baby  
And don't you cry tonight  
  
Give me a whisper  
And give me a sign  
Give me a kiss before you  
Tell me goodbye  
Don't you take it so hard now  
And please don't take it so bad  
I'll still be thinkin' of you  
And the times we had, baby  
  
And don't you cry tonight  
Don't you cry tonight  
Don't you cry tonight  
There's a heaven above you baby  
And don't you cry tonight  
  
And please remember that I never lied  
And please remember  
how I felt inside now honey  
You gotta make it your own way  
But you'll be alright now sugar  
You'll feel better tomorrow  
Come the morning light now baby  
  
And don't you cry tonight  
And don't you cry tonight  
And don't you cry tonight  
There's a heaven above you baby  
And don't you cry  
Don't you ever cry  
Don't you cry tonight  
Baby maybe someday  
Don't you cry  
Don't you ever cry  
Don't you cry  
Tonight

Don't damn me  
When I speak a piece of my mind  
'Cause silence isn't golden  
When I'm holding it inside  
'Cause I've been where I have been  
An I've seen what I have seen  
I put the pen to the paper  
'Cause it's all a part of me  
  
Be it a song or a casual conversation  
To hold my tongue speaks  
Of quiet reservations  
Your words once heard  
They can place you in a faction  
My words may disturb  
But at least there's a reaction  
  
Sometimes I want to kill  
Sometimes I want to die  
Sometimes I want to destroy  
Sometimes I want to cry  
Sometimes I could get even  
Sometimes I could give up  
Sometimes I could give  
Sometimes I never give a fuck  
  
It's only for a while  
I hope you understand  
I never wanted this to happen  
Didn't want to be a man  
So I hid inside my world  
I took what I could find  
I cried when I was lonely  
I fell down when I was blind  
  
But don't damn me when I speak  
A piece of my mind  
'Cause silence isn't golden  
When I'm holding it inside  
'Cause I've been where I have been  
An I've seen what I have seen  
I put the pen to the paper  
'Cause it's all a part of me  
  
How can I ever satisfy you  
An how can I ever make you see  
That, deep inside we're all somebody  
An it don't matter who you want to be  
But now I gotta smile I hope you comprehend  
For this man can say it happened  
'Cause this child has been condemned  
So I stepped into your world  
I kicked you in the mind  
An I'm the only witness  
To the nature of my crime  
  
But look at what we've done  
To the innocent and young  
Whoa listen to who's talking  
'Cause we're not the only ones  
The trash collected by the eyes  
And dumped into the brain  
Said it tears into our conscious thoughts  
You tell me who's to blame  
  
I know you don't want to hear me crying  
An I know you don't want to hear me deny  
That your satisfaction lies in your illusions  
But your delusions are yours an not mine  
We take for granted that we know the whole story  
We judge a book by it's cover  
And read what we want  
Between selected lines  
  
Don't hail me  
An don't idolize the ink  
Or I've failed in my attentions  
Can you find the missing link  
Your only validation is in living your own life  
Vicarious existence is a fucking waste of time  
So I send this song to the offended  
I said what I meant and I've never pretended  
As so many others do intending just to please  
If I damned your point of view  
Could you turn the other cheek  
  
Don't damn me when I speak a piece a mind  
'Cause silence isn't golden  
When I'm holding it inside  
I've been where I have been  
An I've seen what I have seen  
Put the pen to the paper  
'Cause it's all a part of me  
Don't damn me  
I said don't damn me  
I said don't hail me  
Ah, don't damn me

Found a head and an arm in da garbage can  
Don't know why I'm here  
Livin' on the run for oh so long  
I gotta go collect  
Double talkin' jive  
Get the money motherfucker  
'Cause I got no more patience  
Double talkin'  
I got (Lies)  
No more patience man  
  
Back in town an'a all new friends  
They sayin' how ya been?  
Fucked up and outta place  
That's how I felt back then  
Double talkin' jive  
Get the money motherfucker  
'Cause I got no more patience  
Double talkin'  
I got (Lies)  
No more patience man  
You dig what I'm sayin'?

Tell everybody that I am sorry, truly sorry  
For all the wrong I've done  
I never meant to hurt nobody, no no  
Lord I never want to do no wrong  
  
And I have lied, and I have begged and I have cheated  
And I know my ship, it won't be coming in  
And as I lay me down to take my rest  
I can see that it's just dust in the wind  
  
Take hold my hand, and hold it tighter, ever tighter  
You must believe that I love you still  
But my strength, it grows weaker, and weaker  
And my body has lost it's will  
  
'Cause I have lied, and I have begged and I have cheated  
And I know my ship, it won't be coming in  
And as I lay me down to take my rest  
I can see that it's just dust in the wind  
  
Oh Lord, I have lost once again  
And there's no one to help me find my way home  
Lord and I, Lord I never want to hurt nobody  
And I, Lord I never want to do no wrong  
  
'Cause I have lied, and I have begged and I have cheated  
And I know my ship, it won't be coming in  
And as I lay me down to take my rest  
I can see that it's just dust in the wind

Heart-breaker soul-shaker I've been told about you  
Steam-roller the midnight shoulder  
What they been sayin' must be true  
  
Red hot mama oh that charmer  
Time's come to pay your dues  
  
[Chorus:]  
Now you're messin' with a a son of a bitch  
Now you're messin' with a son of a bitch  
Now you're messin' with a a son of a bitch  
Now you're messin' with a son of a bitch  
  
Talking jive and poison ivy  
You ain't gonna cling to me  
Minute-taker fall-faker  
I ain't so blind I can't see  
  
Red hot mama oh that charmer  
Time's come to pay your dues  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Chorus: repeat 4x]

Love  
Is it true  
What they say of you  
  
Gonna call the President  
Gonna call a private eye  
Gonna get the IRS  
Gonna need the FBI  
  
There's not anymore that I can do  
All the reasons that you give  
I follow you  
So when you lead them in, that'll be the end of time it's true  
  
Wouldn't be the first time I've been wrong  
Wouldn't be the last I'm sure, I've known  
With all the rumors I can tell  
Some things didn't work so well  
  
Well anyway, it feels the same  
  
As when you first told me you were gone  
So long ago but I still held on  
Through all the emotions that I've had to take  
And that's the truth, and here's the worst yet  
  
Wouldn't even matter the things that I say  
You've made your mind up and gone anyway  
And there's no use now in dragging it on  
Should've seen it coming all along  
  
Well it's true, oh, I had  
My doubts of you  
  
Gonna call the President  
Gonna call myself a private eye  
Gonna need the IRS  
Gonna get the FBI  
  
Gonna make this a federal case  
Gonna wave it right down in your face  
Read it baby with your morning news  
With a sweet hangover  
And the headlines too, now  
  
I bet you think I'm doing this all for my health  
I should've looked again then at somebody else  
Feelin' like I've done way more than wrong  
Feelin' like I'm livin' inside of this song  
Feelin' like I'm just too tired to care  
Feelin' like I've done more than my share  
Could've been the way that I carried on  
Like a broken record for so long  
  
And I do  
Oh, oh  
I'm gonna call the President  
I'm gonna call a private eye  
Gonna get the IRS  
Gonna need myself the FBI  
  
Oh, what shall I do?  
If I gave my heart to you  
It's such a crime you know it's true  
  
Gonna call the president  
Gonna need myself a private eye  
Ooh, gonna need the IRS  
Gonna get the FBI  
  
Gonna make it a federal case  
Gonna wave it right down in your face  
Read it baby with your morning news  
With the sweet hangover and the headlines too  
  
There's not anymore that I can do

I'm like a little bitty kid with a real big mouth  
And you're gonna have to catch me if you wanna wash it out  
'Cuz I'll be standin' on the corner, callin' you names  
With my juvenile skills and delinquent games  
  
'Cuz I'm a fast motherfucker  
Let me tell you 'bout it sucker  
If you fuck with me, I'll fuck your mother  
Your sister too, and your best girlfriend  
I'll line 'em up, and put 'em end to end  
And then I'll put out, stick it in, I'll pull it out  
I'll grab your face and cum in your mouth  
  
It tastes good, don't it?  
It tastes good, and you know it  
It tastes good, don't it?  
It tastes good, and you know it  
  
If you're looking for trouble, I'm the one  
If you're looking for a fight go have some fun  
Ya like to dance, ya like to sing  
I'm the one and we'll get it on  
Ya wanna dance?

Told you once about your friends  
And neighbors  
They were always seeking  
But they'll never find it  
  
It's alright, it's alright  
Where to go and where to see  
It's always been this way  
And it can never be  
  
It's alright, it's alright  
Give it all and ask for no return  
And very soon you'll see  
And you'll begin to learn  
  
That's it's alright, it's alright  
Don't you know that it's so good for you  
You can be making love and  
See it all go through  
  
But it's alright, it's alright  
Told you once about your friends  
And neighbors  
They were always seeking  
  
But they'll never find it  
It's alright, it's alright

I see your sister in her Sunday dress  
She's out to please  
She pouts her best  
She's out to take  
No need to try  
She's ready to make  
  
It's so easy, easy  
When everybody's tryin' to please me baby  
It's so easy, easy  
When everybody's tryin' to please me  
  
Cars are crashin' every night  
I drink n' drive everything's in sight  
I make the fire  
But I miss the firefight  
I hit the bull's eye every night  
  
It's so easy, easy  
When everybody's tryin' to please me baby  
Yeah it's so easy, easy  
When everybody's tryin' to please me  
So easy  
But nothin' seems to please me  
It all fits so right  
When I fade into the night  
See me hit you  
You fall down  
  
I see standin' there  
You think you're so cool  
Why don't you just  
Fuck off  
  
Ya get nothin' for nothin'  
If that's what ya do  
Turn around bitch I got a use for you  
Besides you ain't got nothin' better to do  
And I'm bored  
  
It's so easy, easy  
When everybody's tryin' to please me baby  
It's so easy, easy  
When everybody's tryin' to please me  
So easy  
But nothin' seems to please me  
It all fits so right  
When I fade into the night  
So come with me  
Don't ask me where 'cause I don't know  
I'll try ta please you  
I ain't got no money but it goes to show  
It's so easy  
So fucking easy  
It's so easy  
So damn easy  
It's so easy  
So fucking easy  
It's so easy

I know you've been dreaming 'bout the times in our lives  
But I've been screaming in my bed late at night  
A space a little, little and your stack of pain  
Makes it grip that skull, to me child that you'll stay  
You've been in my life so long, can I get through to you  
I touch you eyes and it shades my life blue  
There's something I need to say before it's to late  
But I won't hold you back, while I'm begging you to stay  
  
Just another Sunday  
Just another Sunday  
Oh yaaa, just another Sunday  
Just another Sunday, oh yaaa  
  
There's too many games in a day for a simple man to face  
That desperate moment in your life where you can't be afraid  
Don't think your second chance will break around the bend  
Cause hearts don't always share love, or the person on the other  
End  
You've been in my life so long, can I get through to you  
I touch you eyes and it shades my life blue  
There's something I need to say before it's to late  
But I won't hold you back, while I'm begging you to stay ya  
  
Just another Sunday yaa  
Just another Sunday oh baby  
It's only one more Sunday  
Just another Sunday, oh yaaa  
  
Those are tickets for the same plane, bring it back to me  
Cause felling the same pain makes half the luxery  
Take a walk away won't end the carousel  
But if walking away can bring you back, then I wish you well  
You've been in my life so long, can I get through to you  
I touch you eyes and it shades my life blue  
There's something I need to say before it's to late  
But I won't hold you back, while I'm begging you to stay  
  
Just another Sunday yaa  
Just another Sunday oh baby  
It's only one more Sunday  
Just another Sunday  
It's just another Sunday  
It's just another  
Just another Sunday  
Just another oh yaa  
Just another Sunday

Mama take this badge from me  
I can't use it anymore  
It's getting dark, too dark to see  
Feels like I'm knockin' on heaven's door  
  
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door  
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door  
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door  
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door  
  
Mama put my guns in the ground  
I can't shoot them anymore  
That cold black cloud is comin' down  
Feels like I'm knockin' on heaven's door  
  
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door  
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door  
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door  
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door  
  
"You just better start sniffin' your own  
Rank subjugation jack 'cause it's just  
You against your tattered libido, the bank  
And the mortician, forever man and it  
Wouldn't be luck if you could get out of  
Life alive"  
  
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door

When you were young  
And your heart was an open book  
You used to say live and let live  
You know you did  
You know you did  
You know you did  
  
But if this ever changin' world  
In which we live in  
Makes you give in and cry  
Say live and let die  
Live and let die  
  
What does it matter to ya  
When ya got a job to do  
Ya got to do it well  
You got to give the other fella hell  
  
You used to say live and let live  
You know you did  
You know you did  
You know you did  
  
But if this ever changin' world  
In which we live in  
Makes you give in and cry  
Say live and let die  
Live and let die

Gonna find a way to cure this loneliness  
Yeah I'll find a way to cure the pain  
If I said that you're my friend  
And our love would never end  
How long before I had your trust again  
I opened up the doors when it was cold outside  
Hopin' that you'd find your own way in  
But how can I protect you  
Or try not to neglect you  
When you won't take the love I have to give  
I bought me an illusion  
An I put it on the wall  
I let it fill my head with dreams  
And I had to have them all  
But oh the taste is never so sweet  
As what you'd believe it is -  
Well I guess it never is  
It's these prejudiced illusions  
That pump the blood  
To the heart of the biz  
  
You know I never thought  
That it could take so long  
You know I never knew how to be strong  
Yeah, I let you shape me  
But it feels as though you raped me  
'Cause you climbed inside my world  
And in my songs  
So now I've closed the door  
To keep the cold outside  
Seems somehow I've found the will to live  
But how can I forget you  
Or try not to reject you  
When we both know it takes time to forgive  
  
Sweetness is a virtue  
And you lost your virtue long ago  
You know I'd like to hurt you  
But my conscience always tells me no  
You could sell your body on the street  
To anyone whom you might meet  
Who'd love to try and get inside  
And bust your innocence open wide  
  
'Cause my baby's got a locomotive  
My baby's gone off the track  
My baby's got a locomotive  
Got ta peel the bitch off my back  
I know it looks like I'm insane  
Take a closer look I'm not to blame  
No  
  
Gonna have some fun with my frustrations  
Gonna watch the big screen in my head  
I'd rather take a detour  
'cause this road ain't gettin' clearer  
Your train of thought has cut me off again  
Better tame that boy 'cause he's a wild one  
Better tame that boy for he's a man  
Sweetheart don't make me laugh  
You's gettin' too big for your pants  
And I's think maybe you should  
Cut out while you can  
You can use your illusion -  
Let it take you where it may  
We live and learn  
And then sometimes it's best to walk away  
Me I'm just here hangin' on  
It's my only place to stay at least  
For now anyway  
I've worked too hard for my illusions  
Just to throw them all away  
  
I'm taking time quiet consolation  
In passing by this love that's passed away  
I know it's never easy  
So why should you believe me  
When I've always got so many things to say  
Calling off the dogs a simple choice is made  
'Cause playful hearts  
Can sometimes be enraged  
You know I tried to wake you  
I mean how long could it take you  
To open up your eyes and turn the page  
  
Kindness is a treasure  
And it's one towards me you've seldom shown  
So I'd say it for a good measure  
To all the ones like you I've known  
Ya know I'd like to shave your head  
And all my friends could paint it red  
'Cause love to me's a two way street  
An all I really want is peace  
  
But my baby's got a locomotive  
My baby's gone off the track  
My baby's got a locomotive  
Got ta peel the bitch off my back  
I know it looks like I'm insane  
Take a closer look I'm not to blame  
No  
  
Affection is a blessing  
Can you find it in your sordid heart  
I tried to keep this thing ta-gether  
But the tremor tore my pad apart  
Yeah I know it's hard to face  
When all we've worked for's gone to waste  
But you're such a stupid woman  
And I'm such a stupid man  
But love like time's got its own plans  
  
'Cause my baby's got a locomotive  
My baby's gone off the track  
My baby's got a locomotive  
Got ta peel the bitch off my back  
I know it looks like I'm insane  
Take a closer look I'm not to blame  
Yeah  
If love is blind I guess I'll buy myself a cane  
  
Love's so strange

There's a time for a living  
Time keeps on flying  
Think you're loving baby  
But all your doing is crying  
  
Can you feel?  
Are those feelings real?  
Look at your game, girl  
Look at your game, girl  
  
What a mad delusion  
Living in that confusion  
Frustration and doubt  
Can you ever live without the game?  
  
The sad, sad game  
Mad game  
Just to say loves' not enough  
Even it can't be true  
Oh, you can tell those lies, baby, but you're only fooling you  
  
Can you feel?  
Are those feelings real?  
Look at your game, girl  
Go on look at your game, girl  
  
And if you can't feel  
And those feelings aint real  
Then you better, stop tryin'  
Or your gonna play cryin'  
Stop tryin'  
Or your gonna play cryin'  
Stop tryin'  
  
That's the game  
Sad sad game  
Mad game  
Sad game  
  
[spoken]  
Thanks, Charles

I won't be told anymore  
That I've been brought down in this storm  
And left so far out from the shore  
That I can't find my way back, my way anymore  
  
No I won't be told anymore  
That I've been brought back in this storm  
And left so far out from the shore  
That I can't find my way back, my way anymore  
  
No, I..  
No, I...  
  
Forgive them they teared down my soul  
Bless them that they might grow old  
And free them so that they may know  
That it's never too late  
  
For the many times would seem like a memory  
I searched and found the way to choose to the end  
I found the ways, why it had to be  
Mired in denial and saw all the rain  
  
If we ever find it true  
Life we have is made to choose  
Free the ball, the chain  
We're here together  
  
I'm gonna tell you a story  
Stand up for righteousness!  
What?  
Stand up for justice!  
What?  
Stand up for truth!  
How can a person grow up with all this around them?  
You got to call on that something  
Where does it come from?  
That can make a way out of no way  
All this hatred?  
What we've got here is..  
Fear!  
That power that can make a way out of now no way  
Failure to communicate  
I tell ya I seen the lightning...I've heard the thunder roll!  
Everybody's acting like we can do anything and it don't matter what we  
Do. Maybe we gotta be extra careful because maybe it matters more than  
We even know..  
Sometimes...  
Hatred isn't somethin' you're born with  
I feel discouraged  
It gets taught  
Sometimes I feel discouraged  
I felt this fear  
He promised never to leave me, never to leave me alone, no never alone,  
No never alone!  
Let's get something straight, alright?  
Promised never to leave me!  
This whole thing was fucked up  
Never to leave me alone!  
All men betray. All lose heart!  
I don't want to lose heart!...I want to believe  
Black men and white men  
Together at the table of brotherhood!  
I have a dream  
Free at last! Free at last! Thank God almighty!! WE ARE FREE AT LAST!!  
  
  
I won't be told anymore  
That I've been brought down in this storm  
And left so far out from the shore  
And I can't find my way back, my way anymore  
  
No I won't be told anymore  
That I've been brought back in this storm  
And left so far out from the shore  
That I can't find my way back, my way anymore

Livin' out your fantasy  
Sleepin' late and suckin' me, oh no

It's so hard to find piece of mind

You pack your bags  
And you move to the city  
There's somethin' missin' here at home  
You fix your hair  
And you're lookin' real pretty  
It's time to get it out on your own  
You're always fightin'  
With your mama and you papa  
Your family life is one big pain!  
When you, you gonna move to the city?  
Into the city where it all began  
  
You gotta move, You gotta move  
Ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma  
Time you gotta move  
  
You stole your mama's car  
And your daddy's plastic credit card  
You're sixteen and you can't get a job  
You're not goin' very far  
You're always ridin'  
With the teachers and the police  
This life is much too insane!  
When you, you gonna move to the city?  
Into the city where it all began  
  
You gotta move, You gotta move  
Ma,ma,ma,ma,ma,ma,ma,ma,ma  
Time you gotta move  
Right to the city  
Where the real men get it  
Aw, child, ain't it a pity?  
Sometimes it gets too shitty!  
Come on and hit me!  
  
You're on the streets  
And it ain't so pretty  
You need to get a new what you please  
You do what you gotta do for the money  
At times you end up on your knees!  
  
I'm always buyin'  
With the local and the junkies  
This city life is one big pain!  
But you, you had to move to the city  
Into the city where it all began  
  
You gotta move, You gotta move  
Ma,ma,ma,ma,ma,ma,ma,ma,ma  
Time you gotta move  
Oh right to the city  
With the real nitty gritty  
Aw, child, ain't it a pity?  
Sometimes it gets too shitty!  
Come on and hit me!

I get up around seven  
Get outta bed around nine  
And I don't worry about nothin' no  
Cause worryin's a waste of my, time  
  
The show usually starts around seven  
We go on stage at nine  
Get on the bus at eleven  
Sippin' a drink and feelin' fine  
  
We been dancin' with  
Mr. Brownstone  
He's been knockin'  
He won't' leave me alone  
  
I used ta do a little but a little wouldn't do  
So the little got more and more  
I just keep tryin' ta get a little better  
Said a little better than before  
I used ta do a little but a little wouldn't do  
So the little got more and more  
I just keep tryin' ta get a little better  
Said a little better than before  
  
We been dancin' with  
Mr. Brownstone  
He's been knockin'  
He won't leave me alone  
  
Now I get up around whenever  
I used ta get up on time  
But that old man he's a real muthafucker  
Gonna kick him on down the line

You wan'da step into my world  
It's a sociopsychotic state of bliss  
You've been delayed in the real world  
How many times have you hit and missed?  
Your cat-scan shows disfiguration  
I want to laugh myself to death  
With a misfired synapse  
With a bent configuration  
I'll hold the line while you gasp for breath  
You want to talk to me  
So talk to me  
You want to talk to me (7x)  
You can't talk to me  
You don't understand your sex  
You ain't been mindfucked yet  
  
Let's do it (3x)  
Oh my distorted smile  
  
Guess what I'm doing now

(spoken) Is she really going out with him?  
  
Hey!  
  
I got a feeling inside of me,  
It's kinda strange, like a stormy sea  
I don't know why, I don't know why  
I guess these things've gotta be  
  
[Chorus:]  
I got a new rose, I got it good  
Yes, I knew that I always would  
I can't stop to mess around  
I got a brand new rose in town  
  
See the sun, see the sunny skies  
Don't get too close, it'll burn your eyes  
Don't you run away that way  
Come back another day  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I never thought this could happen to me  
I'm a strange washing machine  
I never served somebody this sane  
I'll never, never, never be too late  
  
Hey!  
  
[Repeat first verse]  
  
[Chorus:]

She hit town like a rose in bloom  
Smellin' sweet, said sweet perfume  
The color faded and the petals died  
Down in the city, no one cried  
In the streets, the garbage lies  
Protected by a million flies  
The roaches so big  
You know that they got bones  
They moved in and made a tenement home  
  
I said nice boys  
Don't play rock and roll  
Nice boys don't play rock and roll  
I'm not a nice boy!  
  
Sweet sixteen she was fresh and clean  
Wanted so bad to be part of the scene  
She met the man and she did the smack  
Paid the price layin' flat on her back  
Wanted so bad just to please the boys  
They ended up just being a toy  
Played so hard burned her life away  
Lies were told no promises made  
  
You know nice boys  
Don't play rock and roll  
Nice boys don't play rock and roll  
I'm not a nice boy and I never was!  
  
Young and fresh when she hit town  
Hot for kicks just to get around  
But now she lays in a filthy room  
She kills the pain with  
A flick and a spoon  
And in the streets the garbage lies  
Protected by a million flies  
You know the roaches so big  
You know that they got bones  
Moved in and made a tenement home  
  
Nice boys don't play rock and roll  
Nice boys don't play rock and roll  
Nice boys don't play rock and roll  
Nice boys don't play rock and roll  
Nice boys don't play rock and roll  
No,no,no,no,no,no,no,no baby  
Nice boys don't play rock and roll  
Nice boys don't play rock and roll  
I bet you mama said  
'Nice boys don't play rock and roll'  
Nice boys don't play rock and roll  
Nice boys don't play rock and roll  
Nice boys don't play rock and roll  
Nice boys don't play rock and roll  
Nice boys!

Loaded like a freight train  
Flyin' like an aeroplane  
Feelin' like a space brain  
One more time tonight  
  
Well I'm a west coast struttin'  
One bad mother  
Got a rattlesnake suitcase  
Under my arm  
Said I'm a mean machine  
Been drinkin' gasoline  
And honey you can make my motor hum  
Well I got one chance left  
In a nine live cat  
I got a dog eat dog sly smile  
I got a Molotov cocktail with a match to go  
I smoke my cigarette with style  
An I can tell you honey  
You can make my money tonight  
  
Wake up late honey put on your clothes  
Take your credit card to the liquor store  
That's one for you and two for me by tonight  
I'll be loaded like a freight train  
Flyin' like an aeroplane  
Feelin' like a space brain  
One more time tonight  
  
I'm on the nightrain  
Bottoms up  
I'm on the nightrain  
Fill my cup  
I'm on the nightrain  
Ready to crash and burn  
I never learn  
I'm on the nightrain  
I love that stuff  
I'm on the nightrain  
I can never get enough  
I'm on the nightrain  
Never to return - no  
  
Loaded like a freight train  
Flyin' like an aeroplane  
Speedin' like a space brain  
One more time tonight  
  
I'm on the nightrain  
And I'm lookin' for some  
I'm on the nightrain  
So's I can leave this slum  
I'm on the nightrain  
And I'm ready to crash an' burn  
Nightrain  
Bottoms up  
I'm on the nightrain  
Fill my cup  
I'm on the nightrain  
  
Whoa yeah  
I'm on the nightrain  
Love that stuff  
I'm on the nightrain  
An I can never get enough  
Ridin' the nightrain  
I guess I  
I guess, I guess, I guess I never learn  
  
On the nightrain  
Float me home  
Ooh I'm on the nightrain  
Ridin' the nightrain  
Never to return  
Nightrain

When I look into your eyes  
I can see a love restrained  
But darlin' when I hold you  
Don't you know I feel the same  
  
Nothin' lasts forever  
And we both know hearts can change  
And it's hard to hold a candle  
In the cold November rain  
  
We've been through this such a long long time  
Just tryin' to kill the pain, oo yeah  
But love is always coming and love is always going  
And no one's really sure who's lettin' go today  
Walking away  
  
If we could take the time  
To lay it on the line  
I could rest my head  
Just knowin' that you were mine  
All mine  
So if you want to love me  
Then darlin' don't refrain  
Or I'll just end up walkin'  
In the cold November rain  
  
Do you need some time on your own  
Do you need some time all alone  
Everybody needs some time  
On their own  
Don't you know you need some time all alone  
  
I know it's hard to keep an open heart  
When even friends seem out to harm you  
But if you could heal a broken heart  
Wouldn't time be out to charm you  
  
Sometimes I need some time on my  
Own  
Sometimes I need some time all alone  
Everybody needs some time  
On their own  
Don't you know you need some time all alone  
  
And when your fears subside  
And shadows still remain, oh yeah  
I know that you can love me  
When there's no one left to blame  
So never mind the darkness  
We still can find a way  
'Cause nothin' lasts forever  
Even cold November rain  
  
Don't ya think that you need somebody  
Don't ya think that you need someone  
Everybody needs somebody  
You're not the only one  
You're not the only one  
  
Don't ya think that you need somebody  
Don't ya think that you need someone  
Everybody needs somebody  
You're not the only one  
You're not the only one  
  
Don't ya think that you need somebody  
Don't ya think that you need someone  
Everybody needs somebody  
You're not the only one  
You're not the only one  
  
Don't ya think that you need somebody  
Don't ya think that you need someone  
Everybody needs somebody

It's not how you're thinking  
Like you've been right  
You've been living a trade-off  
Believe your own version  
Believe your enslavery and drain out your soul  
What can I do when there's so many liars  
That crawl through your veins  
Like millions of spiders  
That seek out their victims  
And ruin the wiser  
Watch out  
Gotcha  
  
Oh my god  
I can't deny this  
I've been taught just to kill and fight this  
To bury it deeper where nobody can find it  
Like nobody wanted to know  
  
So give it away  
Like they're not gonna fuck you  
How long can you bear him  
To come back and haunt you  
To burn past your feelings  
And cause you to suffer  
You're starting to bleed  
They don't give you up  
Before its too late  
What will you offer  
In way of a healing  
I'm so confused, abused, misused  
  
Oh my god  
I can't deny this  
I've been taught just to kill and fight this  
To bury it deeper where nobody can find it  
Like nobody wouldn't know  
  
Oh, if it opens your eyes  
This is better than a strong compromise  
I was willing to be lost in the shuffle  
If only you had let me know  
Ooh, if it opens your eyes  
This is better than the last compromise  
I was willing to be lost in the shadows  
If only you had let me know  
  
And they won't give in  
Cause they know what they're after  
A kick in the face  
Like its all that would matter  
Oh  
  
Oh my god  
I can't deny this  
I've been taught just to murder and fight this  
To bury it deeper where no one can find it  
'cause nobody wouldn't know  
  
Oh, if it opens your eyes  
This is better than a good compromise  
I was willing to be lost in the shuffle  
If only you had let me know  
  
Oh, well its on with the show  
Like the tide down on the ocean  
The waves already set in motion  
The only one in the game that's lost is you

Yes I needed some time to get away  
I needed some peace of mind  
Some peace of mind that'll stay  
So I thumbed it. Now it's six in L.A.  
Maybe a greyhound could be my way  
  
Police and niggers, that's right  
Get outta my way  
Don't need to buy none of your  
Gold chains today  
Now don't need no bracelets  
Clamped in front of my back  
Just need my ticket 'till then  
Won't you cut me some slack  
  
You're one in a million  
Yeah that's what you are  
You're one in a million babe  
You're a shooting star  
Maybe some day we'll see you  
Before you make us cry  
You know we tried to reach you  
But you were much to high.  
Much too high...  
Much too high...  
Much too high...  
  
Immigrants and fagots  
They make no sense to me  
They come to our country  
And think they'll do as they please  
Like start some mini-Iran  
Or spread some fucking disease  
And they talk so many God damn ways  
It's all Greek to me  
  
Well some say I'm lazy  
And others say that's just me  
Some say I'm crazy  
I guess I'll always be  
But it's been such a long time  
Since I knew right from wrong  
It's all the means to and end I'm  
I keep it moving along  
Hey, hey, hey, yeah  
  
You're one in a million  
You're a shooting star  
You're one in a million babe  
You know that you are  
Maybe some day we'll see you  
Before you make us cry  
You know we tried to reach you  
But you were much to high  
Much too high  
Much too high  
  
Radicals and racists  
Don't point your finger at me  
I'm a small town white boy  
Just tryin' to make ends meet  
Don't need your religion  
Don't watch that much TV  
Just makin' my livin' baby  
Well that's enough for me  
  
You're one in a million  
Yeah that's what you are  
You're one in a million babe  
You're a shooting star  
Maybe some day we'll see you  
Before you make us cry  
You know we tried to reach you  
But you were much too high  
Much too high  
Much too high

Man's got his woman to take his seed  
He's got the power - oh  
She's got the need  
She spends her life through pleasing up her man  
She feeds him dinner or anything she can  
She cries alone at night too often  
He smokes and drinks and don't come home at all  
  
Only women bleed  
Only women bleed  
Only women bleed  
  
Man makes your hair gray  
He's your life's mistake  
All you're really lookin' for is an even break  
He lies right at you  
You know you hate this game  
He slaps you once in a while and you live and love in pain  
She cries alone at night too often  
He smokes and drinks and don't come home at all  
  
Only women bleed  
Only women bleed  
Only women bleed  
  
Only women bleed  
Only women bleed  
Only women bleed  
  
Black eyes all of the time  
Don't spend a dime  
Clean up this grime  
And you there down on your knees begging me please come  
Watch me bleed.  
  
Only women bleed  
Only women bleed  
Only women bleed  
  
Only women bleed  
Only women bleed  
Only women bleed

Been hidin' out  
And layin' low  
It's nothing new ta me  
Well you can always find a place to go  
If you can keep your sanity  
They break down the doors  
And they rape my rights but  
They won't touch me  
They scream and yell  
And fight all night  
You can't tell me  
I lose my head  
I close my eyes  
They won't touch me  
'Cause I got somethin'  
I been buildin' up inside  
For so fuckin' long  
  
They're out ta get me  
They won't catch me  
I'm fucking innocent  
They won't break me  
  
Sometimes it's easy to forget where you're goin'  
Sometimes it's harder to leave  
And every time you think you know just what you're doin'  
That's when your troubles exceed  
They push me in a corner  
Jest to get me to fight but  
They won't touch me  
They preach and yell  
And fight all night  
You can't tell me  
I lose my head  
I close my eyes  
They won't touch me  
'Cause I got somethin'  
I been buildin' up inside  
  
They're out ta get me  
They won't catch me  
I'm innocent  
They won't break me  
  
Some people got a chip on their shoulder  
And some would say it was me  
But I didn't bey that fifth of whiskey  
That you gave me  
So I'd be quick to disagree  
  
They're out ta get me  
They won't catch me  
I'm innocent  
They won't break me  
  
They're out ta get me  
They won't catch me  
I'm innocent  
So you can  
Suck me  
Take that one to heart

[Chorus]  
Take me down to the paradise city  
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty  
Take me home (oh won't you please take me home)  
Take me down to the paradise city  
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty  
Take me home (oh won't you please take me home)  
  
Just a urchin livin' under the street  
I'm a hard case that's tough to beat  
I'm your charity case so buy me something to eat  
I'll pay you at another time  
Take it to the end of the line  
  
Rags to riches or so they say  
Ya gotta keep pushin' for the fortune and fame  
You know it's all a gamble when it's just a game  
Ya treat it like a capital crime  
Everybody's doin' the time  
  
Take me down to the paradise city  
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty  
Oh won't you please take me home  
Take me down to the paradise city  
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty  
Take me home, yeah yeah  
  
Strapped in the chair of the city's gas chamber  
Why I'm here I can't quite remember  
The surgeon general says it's hazardous to breathe  
I'd have another cigarette but I can't see  
Tell me who you're gonna believe  
  
Take me down to the paradise city  
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty  
Take me home, yeah yeah  
Take me down to the paradise city  
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty  
Oh won't you please take me home  
  
So far away  
So far away  
So far away  
So far away  
  
Captain America's been torn apart  
Now he's a court jester with a broken heart  
He said "turn me around and take me back to the start"  
I must be losing my mind "are you blind?"  
I've seen it all a million times  
  
Take me down to the paradise city  
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty  
Take me home, yeah yeah  
Take me down to the paradise city  
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty  
Oh won't you please take me home  
Take me down to the paradise city  
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty  
Take me home, yeah yeah  
Take me down to the paradise city  
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty  
Oh won't you please take me home  
  
I wanna go, I wanna go  
Oh won't you please take me home  
I wanna see how good it can be  
Oh won't you please take me home  
Take me down to the paradise city  
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty  
Take me home  
Take me down to the paradise city  
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty  
Oh won't you please take me home  
Take me down, lead me 'round  
Oh won't you please take me home  
  
I wanna see, what a woman can be  
I want to take you home  
Take me down to the paradise city  
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty  
Oh won't you please take me home  
I wanna go, I wanna know  
Oh won't you please take me home

One, two, one, two, three, four  
  
Shed a tear 'cause I'm missin' you  
I'm still alright to smile  
Girl, I think about you every day now  
Was a time when I wasn't sure  
But you set my mind at ease  
There is no doubt you're in my heart now  
  
Said woman take it slow, and it'll work itself out fine  
All we need is just a little patience  
Said sugar make it slow and we'll come together fine  
All we need is just a little patience (Patience)  
Mm, yeah  
  
I sit here on the stairs  
'Cause I'd rather be alone  
If I can't have you right now, I'll wait dear  
Sometimes I get so tense but I can't speed up the time  
But you know love there's one more thing to consider  
  
Said woman take it slow and things will be just fine  
You and I'll just use a little patience  
Said sugar take the time 'cause the lights are shining bright  
You and I've got what it takes to make it  
We won't fake it, I'll never break it  
'Cause I can't take it  
  
Little patience, mm yeah, mm yeah  
Need a little patience, yeah  
Just a little patience, yeah  
Some more patience, yeah (I've been walking the streets at night, just trying
to get it right)  
A little patience, yeah (Its hard to see with so many around  
You know I don't like being stuck in the crowd)  
Could use some patience, yeah (And the streets don't change but maybe the
names)  
(I ain't got time for the game 'cause I need you)  
Gotta have more patience, yeah (Yeah, yeah but I need you)  
All need some patience (Ooh I need you, whoa I need you)  
Just a little patience is all you need (Ooh, this time, ah)

Kickin' back in the shadows  
Got no need for the light  
Who's sorry now old timer  
Look at how you've spent your life  
Scroungin' for change  
To put some money in your pocket  
My how scratch does burn  
Laughin' at the fuckers as you piss it away  
  
But I got the time and I got the muscle  
I got the need to lay it all on the line  
I ain't afraid of your smoke screen hustle  
It's a perfect crime  
God dammit it's a perfect crime  
Mother fucker it's a perfect crime  
  
I said it's perfect  
  
An keep the demons down  
And drag the skeletons out  
I got a blind man followin' me in chains  
I said he's fun to watch  
When the world has stopped  
An I think he's got somethin' to say  
"You want to fuck with me? Don't fuck with me  
'Cause I'm what you'll be, so don't fuck with me  
If you had better sense  
You'd step aside from the bad side of me  
Don't fuck wit da bad side o' me  
Stay way from the bad side o' me  
Don't fuck wit da bad side"  
  
T minus 1:09 and counting...  
  
Ostracized but that's all right  
I was thinkin' about somethin' myself  
  
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight  
  
Call on everybody who's got last rites  
Said it's better  
If you locked 'em away  
Runnin' through the visions  
At the speed of light  
Won't ya let me be  
Mother fucker just let me be  
God dammit better let me be  
Don't ya know ya better let me aaahh!  
  
Perfect crime  
God dammit it's a a perfect crime  
Mother fucker it's a perfect crime  
Don't ya know  
It's a perfect crime

(the perils of rock n' roll decadence)  
  
I know this chick she lives down on Melrose  
She ain't satisfied without some pain  
Friday night is goin' up inside her...again  
Well crack the whip  
'Cause that bitch is just insane  
I'm serious  
  
She's pretty tied up hangin' upside down  
She's pretty tied up an you can ride her  
She's pretty tied up hangin' upside down  
I can't tell you she's the right one  
Oh no, oh no, oh no  
  
Once there was this rock n' roll band  
Rollin' on the streets  
Time went by and it became a joke  
We just needed more and more fulfilling... uh-huh  
Time went by and it all went up in smoke  
But check it out  
  
She's pretty tied up hangin' upside down  
She's pretty tied up an you can ride her  
She's pretty tied up hangin' upside down  
Ohh I can't tell you she's the right one  
Oh no, oh no, oh no  
  
Once you made that money it costs more now  
It might cost a lot more than you'd think  
I just found a million dollars  
that someone forgot  
It's days like this that push me o'er the brinks  
Cool and stressing  
[pronounced: cool ranch dres'ing]  
  
She's pretty tied up hangin' upside down  
She's pretty tied up an you can ride her  
She's pretty tied up hangin' upside down  
And I can't tell you she's the right one  
Oh she's the right one ...(etc.)  
  
(but I can tell you a thing or two  
'bout somethin' else  
If you really want to know...know what I'm sayin')

Seems like forever and a day  
  
If my intentions are misunderstood  
Please be kind  
I've done all I should  
I won't ask of you  
What I would not do  
Oh, I saw the damage in you  
My fortunate one  
The envy of youth  
  
Why would they  
Tell me to please those  
That laugh in my face  
With all of the reasons  
They've taught  
Fall over themselves  
To give way, oh yeah  
  
It's not a question  
Whether my heart is true  
Streamlined  
I had to pull through  
Look for a new  
Beginning on you  
Oh, I, I got a message for you  
Up and away  
It's what I gotta do  
Give what you have  
For what you might lose  
  
What would you say  
If I told you that I'm to blame?  
And what would you do  
If I had to deny your name?  
Where would you go if I told you  
"I love you"  
And then walk away? Oh yeah!  
N' who should I turn to  
If not for the ones  
That you would not save? Alright  
  
I told you when I found you  
If there were doubts you  
Should be careful and unafraid  
Now  
They surround you  
And all that amounts too  
Is love that you fed by  
Perversion and pain  
  
So if my affections  
Are misunderstood  
And you decide  
I'm up  
To no good  
Don't ask me to  
Enjoy them  
Just for you  
  
Ask yourself  
What I would choose  
To prostitute myself  
To live with fortune and shame  
Oh yeah!  
When you should  
Have turned to the hearts  
Of the ones  
That you could not save, oh now!  
  
I told you when I found you  
All that amounts too  
Is love that you fed by  
Perversion and pain

Raid N' the Bedouins  
Had a plan, and thought they'd win  
But I don't give a fuck 'bout them  
Cause I am crazy  
  
Oh, my salvation  
N' all my frustrations  
Caught in the lies  
No one had wove so well  
Somewhere in time  
Where only I could tell  
Ohhhh  
  
Raid N' the Bedouins  
Say that's a war that you can't win  
But I have had enough of them  
And who can blame me  
  
Sands of time and desert winds  
Nomads and Barbarians  
I won't bend my will to them  
You aggravate me  
  
Oh, my salvation  
N' all my frustrations  
Caught in the lies  
No one had wove so well  
Somewhere in time  
Where only I could tell  
Ohhhh  
  
Raid N' the Bedouins  
Say that's a war that you can't win  
But I have had enough of them  
And who can blame me  
  
Sands of time and desert winds  
Nomads and Barbarians  
I won't bend my will to them  
You aggravate me  
  
Oh, my salvation  
N' all my frustrations  
Caught in the lies  
No one had wove so well  
Somewhere in time  
Where only I could tell  
Ohhhh  
  
Oh, sweet salvation  
N' all my frustrations  
Caught in the lies  
If you ignore this world  
Somewhere in time  
When will I, get there?  
  
Oh, sweet salvation  
And my frustrations  
Caught in the lies  
If you had wove so well  
Somewhere in time  
Where only I could tell  
Ohhhh  
  
Raid N' the Bedouins  
Had a plan, and thought they'd win  
  
Raid N' the Bedouins  
Crossed the line and lost again

I'm reckless and feelin' no pain  
You know I've got no need to control  
Livin' with the danger  
I'm always on the edge now  
With million dollar visions that I hold  
Livin' like this never ever  
Tore my life apart  
I know how to maintain  
And you know I know my part  
  
On a holiday, a permanent vacation  
I'm living on a cigarette with wine  
I'm never alone 'cause I've got myself  
Yes, I imitate myself all of the time  
  
Livin' like this never ever  
Tore my life apart  
I know how to maintain  
Cause it's comin' from my heart  
  
I lead a reckless life  
And I don't need your advice  
I lead a reckless life  
And you know it's my only vice  
  
Reckless life  
I lead a reckless life  
I lead a reckless life  
And you know it's my only  
  
Reckless life  
I lead a reckless life  
I lead a reckless life  
And you know it's my only  
Hey, hey, yeah!

I'll take a nicotine, caffeine, sugar fix  
Jesus don't ya git tired of turnin' tricks  
But when your innocence dies  
You'll find the blues  
Seems all our heroes were born to lose  
Just walkin' through time  
You believe this heat  
Another empty house another dead end street  
Gonna rest my bones an sit for a spell  
This side of heaven this close to Hell  
  
Right next door to hell  
Why don't you write a letter to me yeah  
I said I'm right next door to hell  
An so many eyes are on me  
Right next door to hell  
I got nowhere else to be  
Right next door to hell  
Feels like the walls are closing in on me  
  
My mamma never really said much to me  
She was much too young and scared ta be  
Hell "Freud" might say that's what I need  
But all I really ever get is greed  
An most my friends they feel the same  
Hell we don't even have ourselves to blame  
But times are hard and thrills are cheaper  
As your arms get shorter  
Your pockets get deeper  
  
Right next door to hell  
Why don't you write a letter to me yeah  
I said I'm right next door to hell  
An so many eyes are on me  
Right next door to hell  
I never thought this is where I'd be  
Right next door to hell  
Thinkin' time'll stand still for me  
  
Fuck you  
Bitch  
  
Not bad kids just stupid ones  
Yeah we thought we'd own the world  
An gettin' used was havin' fun  
I said we're not sad kids just lucid ones yeah  
Flowin' through life not collectin' anyone  
So much out there  
Still so much to see  
Time's too much to handle  
Time's too much for me  
It drives me up the walls  
Drives me out of my mind  
Can you tell me what this means...huh?

If I say I don't need anyone  
I can say these things to you  
'Cause I can turn on anyone  
Just like I've turned on you  
I've got a tongue like a razor  
A sweet switchblade knife  
And I can do you favors  
But then you'll do whatever I like  
  
[Chorus:]  
Here I am  
And you're a Rocket Queen  
I might be a little young  
But honey I ain't naive  
Here I am  
And you're a Rocket Queen oh yeah  
I might be too much  
But honey you're a bit obscene  
  
I've seen everything imaginable  
Pass before these eyes  
I've had everything that's tangible  
Honey you'd be surprised  
I'm a sexual innuendo  
In this burned out paradise  
If you turn me on to anything  
You better turn me on tonight  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I see you standin'  
Standin' on your own  
It's such a lonely place for you  
For you to be  
If you need a shoulder  
Or if you need a friend  
I'll be here standing  
Until the bitter end  
No one needs the sorrow  
No one needs the pain  
I hate to see you  
Walking out there  
Out in the rain  
So don't chastise me  
Or think I, I mean you harm  
Of those that take you  
Leave you strung out  
Much too far  
Baby-yeah  
  
Don't ever leave me  
Say you'll always be there  
All I ever wanted  
Was for you  
To know that I care

Lets drink to the hard working people,  
Lets drink to the lowly of birth.  
Raise your glass to the good and the evil,  
Lets drink to the salt of the earth.  
  
Say a prayer for the common foot soldier,  
Spare a thought for his back breaking work.  
Say a prayer for his wife and his children,  
Who burn the fires and who still till the earth.  
  
And when I search a faceless crowd,  
A swirling mass of gray and black and white.  
They don't look real to me,  
In fact, they look so strange.  
  
Raise your glass to the hard working people,  
Lets drink to the uncounted heads.  
Lets think of the wandering millions,  
Who need leaders but get gamblers instead.  
  
Spare a thought for the stay at home voter,  
His empty eyes gaze at strange beauty shows.  
And a parade of the gray suited grafters,  
A choice of cancer or polio.  
  
And when I search a faceless crowd,  
A swirling mass of gray and black and white.  
They don't look real to me,  
In fact, they look so strange.  
  
Lets drink to the hard working people,  
Lets think of the lowly of birth.  
Spare a thought for the rag taggy people,  
Sets drink to the salt of the earth.  
  
Lets drink to the hard working people,  
Lets drink to the salt of the earth.  
Lets think of the two thousand million,  
Lets think of the humble of birth.

[Chorus:]  
Don't you try and stop us now  
I just refuse  
Don't you try to stop us now  
'Cause I just won't let you  
  
Sometimes I feel like the world is on top of me  
Breaking me down with an endless monotony  
Sometimes I feel like there's nothing that's stopping me  
All things are possible, I am unstoppable  
  
So they convince you no one can break through  
I'm here to tell you you're worth more than they tell you  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Sometimes I feel like my life's a catastrophe  
Can't understand why it seems like it has to be  
Sometimes I feel like it's all opened up for me  
Nothing's impossible, I am unconquerable  
  
No one can make you do what they want to  
You know you're stronger than the lies that they tell you  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
So they convince you no one can break through  
You know you're stronger than the lies that they tell you  
  
[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

Took my chances carelessly  
choked on my own cigarette  
You can hand me another bottle of whiskey baby  
but you ain't seen the worst yet  
  
Now I'm reckless, gonna have some fun  
and the woman who is dead  
who was out alnight, no I'm not the only one  
  
And I ain't standing, never standing  
in the shadow of your love  
shadow of your love  
shadow of your love  
shadow of your love  
  
Wrote my changes helplessly  
yeah but I got no regrets  
Money it was on the table  
so I booked with all the bets  
  
Living like a lemon ain't so hot  
and you ain't my idea  
of one high-rollin' shot  
  
No I ain't standing, never standing  
[Chorus]  
Big dark clouds hanging over your head  
hope you've heard, baby all I've said  
You've been told, what I've said  
No use crying, you're as good as dead  
  
Now I'm reckless, gonna have some fun  
and the woman who is dead, who is out alright  
now I'm not the only one  
  
And I ain't standing, never standing  
[Chorus]  

Listen motherfuckers to this song that should be heard  
Thrown down in the gutter, it's more than you deserve  
Kneeling fucking virgin, you know that's what you are  
Pussy for a maggot, isn't that a shock  
  
What can I do? With a bitch like you  
You know that it's true  
All I have I ask of you  
I'll be dammed  
If it's not true  
A bitch like you  
  
Get your head down in the sky  
Fucking little schemer got yourself a broken heart  
Syphilitic preachers baby I know who you are  
Parasitic demons sucking acid through your heart  
  
What can I do? With a bitch like you  
You know that it's true  
All I have I ask of you  
I'll be dammed  
If it's not true  
A bitch like you

I don't have plans and schemes  
And I don't have hopes and dreams  
I, I, I don't have anything  
Since I don't have you  
  
And I don't have fond desires  
And I don't have happy hours  
I don't have anything  
Since I don't have you  
  
Happiness and I guess  
I never will again  
When you walked out on me  
In walked ol' misery  
And she's been here since then  
  
Yeah, we're fucked!  
  
I don't have love to share  
And I don't have one who cares  
I, I, I, I don't have anything  
Since I don't have you  
  
You, you, you, oh, oh!  
You, you, you, oh, oh!  
You, you, you, oh, oh!  
You, you, you, oh, oh!  
You, you, oh yeah!

You like to hurt me you know that you do  
You like to think in some way that its me and not you  
You like to have me jump and be good, but I don't want to do it  
You don't know why I wont act the way you think I should  
You thought they'd make me, behave and submit  
  
What were you thinking, cause I don't forget  
  
You don't know why  
I wont give in  
To hell with the pressure  
I'm not caving in  
You know that I got under your skin  
You sold your soul but I wont let you win  
You talk to much  
You say I do  
Difference is know one cares about you  
  
You've got all the answers  
You know everything  
Well nobody asked you  
Its a mystery to me  
  
I'm sorry for you  
Not sorry for me (not sorry for me)  
You don't know who in the hell to or not to believe  
I'm sorry for you  
Not sorry for me (not sorry for me)  
  
You don't know who you can trust now  
But you should believe  
You should believe  
You close your eyes  
All well and good  
I'll kick your ass like I said that I would  
You tell them story's they'd rather believe  
Use and confuse them their numb and naive  
Truth is the truth hurts don't you agree  
Its harder to live with the truth about you  
Than to live with the lies about me  
  
Know body owes you  
Not one god damn thing  
You know where to put your  
Just shut up and say  
  
I'm sorry for you  
  
Not sorry for me (not sorry for me)  
  
You don't know who in the hell to or not to believe  
  
I'm sorry for you  
  
Not sorry for me (not sorry for me)  
  
You chose to hurt those that love you and wont set them free

Please allow me to introduce myself  
I'm a man of wealth and taste  
I've been around for a long, long year  
Stole many a man's soul and faith  
  
And I was 'round when Jesus Christ  
Had his moment of doubt and pain  
Made damn sure that Pilate  
Washed his hands and sealed his fate  
  
Pleased to meet you  
Hope you guess my name  
But what's puzzling you  
Is the nature of my game  
  
I stuck around St. Petersberg  
When I saw it was a time for a change  
Killed the Czar and his ministers  
Anastasia screamed in vain  
  
I rode a tank  
Held a general's rank  
When the Blitzkrieg raged  
And the bodies stank  
  
Pleased to meet you  
Hope you guess my name, oh yeah  
What's puzzling you  
Is the nature of my game, oh yeah  
  
I watched with glee  
While your kings and queens  
Fought for ten decades  
For the Gods they made  
  
I shouted out  
"Who killed the Kennedys?"  
When after all  
It was you and me  
  
Let me please introduce myself  
I'm a man of wealth and taste  
And I laid traps for troubadours  
Who get killed before they reached Bombay  
  
Pleased to meet you  
Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah  
But what's puzzling you  
Is the nature of my game, oh yeah, get down, baby  
  
Pleased to meet you  
Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah  
But what's confusing you  
Is just the nature of my game  
  
Just as every cop is a criminal  
And all the sinners saints  
As heads is tails  
Just call me Lucifer  
'Cause I'm in need of some restraint  
  
So if you meet me  
Have some courtesy  
Have some sympathy, and some taste  
Use all your well-learned politesse  
Or I'll lay your soul to waste, um yeah  
  
Pleased to meet you  
Hope you guessed my name, um yeah  
But what's puzzling you  
Is the nature of my game, um baby, get down  
  
Woo, who  
Oh yeah, get on down  
Oh yeah  
Oh yeah!  
  
Tell me baby, what's my name  
Tell me honey, baby guess my name  
Tell me baby, what's my name  
I tell you one time, you're to blame  
  
Ooo, who  
Ooo, who  
Ooo, who  
Ooo, who, who  
Ooo, who, who  
Ooo, who, who  
Ooo, who, who  
Oh, yeah  
  
What's my name  
Tell me, baby, what's my name  
Tell me, sweetie, what's my name  
  
Ooo, who, who  
Ooo, who, who  
Ooo, who, who  
Ooo, who, who  
Ooo, who, who  
Ooo, who, who  
Ooo, who, who  
Oh, yeah

All the love in the world couldn't save you  
All the innocence inside  
You know I tried so hard to make you  
To make you change your mind  
  
And it hurts too much to see you  
And how you left yourself behind  
You know I didn't want to meet you  
Now there's a hell I can't describe  
  
So now I wander through my day  
Trying to find my way  
Still these feelings that I felt  
I said to you and no one else  
  
And no it's not going to change  
I know it's gone, still I'm used  
And that's nice to hang on someone  
A change that's bittersweet  
  
That's called the blues  
  
Don't know just what I should do  
Everywhere I go I see you  
You know it's what you planned, this much is true  
What I thought was beautiful don't live inside of you, anymore  
  
I don't know just what I should do  
Everywhere I go I see you  
You know it's what we planned, this much is true  
What I thought was beautiful don't live inside of you, anymore  
  
What this means to me  
The more I know you believe  
What I thought was you now  
Has got more that it changed on you  
  
What I thought was true  
The more that I might know is you  
What I thought was you  
Is only memories, distant

Broken glass and cigarettes,  
Writing on the wall,  
It was a bargain for the summer,  
And I thought I had it all.  
I was the one who gave you everything,  
The one who took the fall,  
You were the one who would do anything,  
The one who can't recall  
Where she was while she was sleeping,  
In another woman's bed,  
Or the doctors or the lawyers,  
Or a stranger that she met.  
If there's nothing I can gain from this,  
Or anything at all,  
It'd be the knowledge that ya gave me,  
When I thought I had it all.  
  
It was a long time with you,  
It was a long time with me,  
It'd be a long for anyone,  
But looks like it's meant to be.  
  
Social class and registers,  
Cocaine in the hall,  
All the way from California,  
On the way beyond that stall.  
To those non-negotiations  
To simulate a call,  
All the bad of learning evils and your ways around the laws that keep you  
  
Up and sitting pretty,  
On a pedestal of men  
And now you're sleeping like an angel,  
Near the man who reaped it in.  
  
If there's something I can make of this,  
Or anything at all,  
It'd be the devil hates a loser and you thought you had it all.  
  
It was a wrong time for you,  
It was a wrong time for me,  
It was the wrong time for everyone  
But looks like I'm about to see for myself.  
  
If I could go back in time to the place in my soul,there all alone  
Lonely tear drops,  
Ooh,are calling you.  
But I don't wanna know it now,  
'cause knowing you, it won't change a damn thing.  
But there was a time.  
  
Yeah, there was a time,  
Didn't wanna know it all,  
Didn't wanna know it all and  
I don't wanna know it now  
  
Oh,  
  
Yeah, there was a time,  
Didn't wanna know it all,  
Didn't wanna know it all and  
I don't wanna know it now,  
  
Oh,  
I would do anything for you,  
There was a time,  
I would do anything for you,  
Oh,I would do anything for you,  
There was a time.  
  
There was a time,  
Oh, I would do anything for you,  
Oh, I would do anything for you  
Yeah there was a time,  
Didn't wanna know it all,  
Didn't wanna know it all,  
And I don't wanna know it now,  
I would do anything for you,  
There was a time, was a time

I said baby you been looking real good  
You know that I remember when we met  
It's funny how I never felt so good  
It's a feeling that I know I know I'll never forget  
Oooh it was the best time I can remember  
Oooh and the love we shared  
Lovin' that'll last forever  
  
There wasn't much in this heart of mine  
But there's a little left and babe you found it  
It's funny how I never felt so high  
It's a feeling that I know I know I'll never forget  
Oooh, it was the best time I can remember  
Oooh and the love we shared  
Lovin' that'll last forever  
  
I think about you  
Honey you're the time my heart says 'yes'  
I think about you  
Deep inside I love you best  
I think about you  
You know you're the one I want  
I think about you  
Darling you're the only one, I think about you...  
Yeah! Hahaha!  
  
I think about you  
You know that I do  
I think about you  
All alone only you  
I think about you  
Oooh its true  
I think about you  
Yes I do...  
  
Somethin' changed in this heart of mine  
And I'm so glad that you showed me  
Honey now you're my best friend  
I want to stay together 'til the very end  
Oooh, it was the best time I can remember  
Oooh and the love we shared  
Lovin' that'll last forever  
  
I think about you  
Honey you're the time my heart says 'yes'  
I think about you  
Deep inside I love you best  
I think about you  
You know you're the one I want  
I think about you  
Darling you're the only one  
  
I think about you (Oh oh yeah)  
I think about you (Oh you)  
I think about you (Only you you you...)  
I think about you (You know I do)  
I think about you (Only you)  
I think about you  
Only you  
Only  
You  
Only

And now I don't know why  
She wouldn't say goodbye  
But then it seems that I  
Had seen it in her eyes  
  
And it might not be wise  
I'd still have to try  
With all the love I have inside  
I can't deny  
  
I just can't let it die  
'Cause her heart's just like mine  
She holds her pain inside  
  
So if you ask me why  
She wouldn't say goodbye  
I know somewhere inside  
  
There is a special light  
Still shining bright  
And even on the darkest night  
She can't deny  
  
So if she's somewhere near me  
I hope to God she hears me  
There's no one else  
Could ever make me feel  
I'm so alive  
I hoped she'd never leave me  
Please God you must believe me  
I've searched the universe  
And found myself  
Within' her eyes  
  
No matter how I try  
They say it's all a lie  
So what's the use of my  
Confessions to a crime  
Of passions that won't die  
In my heart  
  
So if she's somewhere near me  
I hope to God she hears me  
There's no one else  
Could ever make me feel  
I'm so alive  
I hoped she'd never leave me  
Please God you must believe me  
I've searched the universe  
And found myself  
Within' her eyes  
  
So if she's somewhere near me  
I hope to God she hears me  
There's no one else  
Could ever make me feel  
I'm so alive  
  
I hoped she'd never leave me  
Please God you must believe me  
I've searched the universe  
And found myself  
Within' her eyes  
  
And now I don't know why  
She wouldn't say goodbye  
It just might be that I  
Had seen it in her eyes  
And now it seems that I  
Gave up my ghost of pride  
I'll never say goodbye

"Hey this bottle's empty, you got 2 bucks?  
C'mon, we'll buy a bottle  
Alright, I'm headin' to the store and I'm gonna buy smokes  
Hot damn"  
  
Every night, I go out and get in my car, oh yeah  
I push on the peddle but you know I go too far  
There're parties everywhere that I can see  
Usin' myself will be the death of me  
Ya see every night I get a call on the telephone  
My sweet little baby beggin' me just to come home  
But I know that everyday I gotta have me some fun  
With Suzy to the left and Sally to my right  
I know that I need just more than one  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Said it's too much too fast  
I don't care if I won't last  
Said it's too much too soon  
I don't care, get outta my room  
Said it's too much too fast  
I don't care if I won't last  
Said it's too much too soon  
I don't care, get outta my room  
  
Let's go  
  
When the night goes on and I seem to see some friends  
Now a buck for the car for the gas goes so fast?  
With friends like that tell me who's gonna last  
Well the city's hot but tonight I'm not  
I want everything that everybody's got  
Not a badge in the pan or a legend hand  
Just give me one more, one last dance  
  
Said it's too much too fast  
I don't care if I won't last  
Said it's too much too soon  
I don't care, get outta my room  
Said it's too much too fast  
I don't care if I won't last  
Said it's too much too soon  
I don't care, get outta my room  
  
Let's go  
  
Take the car, take the keys  
Said my money don't grow on trees  
You make me stumble and fall  
T'ill I'm bloody at my knees?  
I climbed back up to find that all my money's gone  
Too much too soon not know since it's been so long?  
You can drive me to the edge but I really don't mind  
Ya see when I'm in my car I leave you behind  
There's another girl that's waitin' down the road  
When I'm out the door you know that's just where I'll go  
  
Said it's too much too fast  
I don't care if I won't last  
Said it's too much too soon  
I don't care, get outta my room  
Said it's too much too fast  
I don't care if I won't last  
Said it's too much too soon  
I don't care, get outta my room  
  
Said it's too much too fast  
I don't care if I won't last  
Said it's too much too soon  
I don't care, get outta my room  
Said it's too much too fast  
I don't care if I won't last  
Said it's too much too soon  
I don't care, get outta my room  
  
Said it's too much too fast  
I don't care if I won't last  
Said it's too much too soon  
I don't care, get outta my room  
Said it's too much too fast  
I don't care if I won't last  
Said it's too much too soon  
I don't care, get outta my room  
  
Said it's too much too fast  
I don't care if I won't last  
Said it's too much too soon  
I don't care, get outta my room  
Said it's too much too fast  
I don't care if I won't last  
Said it's too much too soon  
I don't care, get outta my room

Well, on a train, I met a dame,  
She rather handsome, we kinda looked the same  
She was pretty, from New York City  
I'm walkin' down that old fair lane,  
I'm in heat, I'm in love,  
But I just couldn't tell her so  
I said, train kept a-rollin' all night long  
Train kept a-rollin' all night long  
Train kept a-rollin' all night long  
Train kept a-rollin' all night long  
With a "heave!", and a "ho!"  
But I just couldn't tell her so, no, no, no  
Well, get along, sweet little woman get along  
On your way, get along, sweet little woman get along  
On your way,  
I'm in heat, I'm in love,  
But I just couldn't tell her so, no, no, no

I'm in heat, I'm in love,  
But I just couldn't tell her  
Well, we made a stop in Albequerque  
She must'a thought I was a real cool jerk  
Got off the train, and put her hands up  
Lookin' so good I couldn't let her go  
But I just couldn't tell her so  
I said, train kept a-rollin' all night long

I used to love her, but I had to kill her  
I used to love her, but I had to kill her  
I had to put her, six feet under, and I can still hear her complain  
  
I used to love her, but I had to kill her  
I used to love her, but I had to kill her  
I knew I'd miss her, so I had to keep her  
She's buried right in my back yard  
  
I used to love her, but I had to kill her  
I used to love her, but I had to kill her  
She bitched so much. She drove me nuts, and now I'm happier this way  
I used to love her, but I had to kill her, and I can still hear her complain

Welcome to the jungle we've got fun and games  
We got everything you want honey, we know the names  
We are the people that can find whatever you may need  
If you got the money honey we got your disease  
  
[Chorus]  
In the jungle, welcome to the jungle  
Watch it bring you to your knnn knne knees, knees  
I want to watch you bleed  
  
Welcome to the jungle we take it day by day  
If you want it you're gonna bleed but it's the price to pay  
And you're a very sexy girl that's very hard to please  
You can taste the bright lights but you won't get there for free  
In the jungle welcome to the jungle  
Feel my, my, my serpentine  
Ooh, I want to hear you scream  
  
Welcome to the jungle it gets worse here every day  
Ya learn to live like an animal in the jungle where we play  
If you hunger for what you see you'll take it eventually  
You can have everything you want but you better not take it from me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And when you're high you never ever want to come down  
So down, so down, so down, yeah  
  
You know where you are?  
You're down in the jungle baby, you're gonna dieee  
In the jungle welcome to the jungle  
Watch it bring you to your knees, knees  
In the jungle welcome to the jungle  
Feel my, my, my serpentine  
In the jungle welcome to the jungle  
Watch it bring you to your knees, knees  
In the jungle welcome to the jungle  
Watch it bring you to you  
Its gonna bring you down, ha!!

I tried so hard just to get through to you  
But your head's so far  
From the realness of truth  
Was it just a come on in the dark  
Wasn't meant to last long  
I think you've worn your welcome honey  
I'll just see you along as I sing you this song  
  
Time can pass slowly  
Things always change  
Your day's been numbered  
And I've read your last page  
You was just a temporary love  
But honey you ain't the first  
Lots of other come before you woman  
Said but you been the worst  
Said you been the worst  
  
So goodbye to you girl  
So long, farewell  
I can't hear you cryin'  
Your jivin's been hell  
So look for me walkin'  
Down your street at night  
I'll be in with another  
Deep down inside  
Deep down inside

I'm a cold heartbreaker  
Fit ta burn and I'll rip your heart in two  
And I'll leave you lyin' on the bed  
I'll be out the door before you wake  
It's nuthin' new to you  
'Cause I think we've seen that movie too  
  
'Cause you could be mine  
But you're way out of line  
With your bitch slap rappin'  
And your cocaine tongue  
You get nuthin' done  
I said you could be mine  
  
Now holidays come and then they go  
It's nothin' new today  
Collect another memory  
When I come home late at night  
Don't ask me where I've been  
Just count your stars I'm home again  
  
'Cause you could be mine  
But you're way out of line  
With your bitch slap rappin'  
And your cocaine tongue  
You get nuthin' done  
I said you could be mine  
You could be mine  
You could be mine  
You could be mine  
You could be mine  
You could be mine, mine, mine, mine  
  
You've gone sketchin' too many times  
Why don't you give it a rest  
Why  
Must you find  
Another reason to cry  
  
While you're breakin' down my back n'  
I been rackin' out my brain  
It don't matter how we make it  
'Cause it always ends the same  
You can push it for more mileage  
But your flaps are wearin' thin  
And I could sleep on it 'til mornin'  
But this nightmare never ends  
Don't forget to call my lawyers  
With ridiculous demands  
An you can take the pity so far  
But it's more than I can stand  
'Cause this couchtrip's gettin' older  
Tell me how long has it been  
'Cause five years is forever  
And you haven't grown up yet  
  
You could be mine  
But you're way out of line  
With your bitch slap rappin'  
And your cocaine tongue  
You get nuthin' done  
I said you could be  
You should be  
You could be mine  
You could be mine  
You could be mine  
You could be mine  
You could be mine  
You could be mine  
You could be mine  
You could be mine  
You could be mine
