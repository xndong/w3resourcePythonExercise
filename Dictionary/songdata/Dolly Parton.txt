(Dolly Parton)  
There's a bit of magic in a simple little smile  
Something that just makes life seem a little more worthwhile  
And there's a world of meaning in the touch of someone's hand  
A gentle touch that let's your brother know you understand  
Oh if people would stop taking and just once try to give  
We could make the world we're living in a better place to live  
La la la la la la la la la la la la  
And if we'd love one another instead of finding faults  
We could afford the price of peace, love is all it costs  
Oh wouldn't it be great to live and sing in harmony  
Everybody take your brother's hand and sing my song with me  
La la la la la la la la la la la la  
All life has to offer that's what most folks desire  
But offer nothing in return, cause they don't seem to care  
And if we'd ask to be forgiven and be willing to forgive  
We could make the world we're living in a better place to live  
And if we'd all climb together, we could climb the highest hill  
We could make the world we're living in a better place to live  
And if we'd love one another instead of finding faults  
We could afford the price of peace, love is all it costs  
Oh wouldn't it be great to live and sing in harmony  
Everybody take your brother's hand and sing my song with me  
La la la la la la la la la la la la  

(Dolly Parton)  
Sometimes he gets crazy as men are known to do  
He'll lose his head in spite of everything he stands to lose  
What is it in a man that makes him act like such a fool  
She swears she never knew but always needed to  
But stubborn pride is just the way of cowboys I suppose  
Even love can't change the things he ought to change the most  
And it's pride that keeps him standing when he should be on his knees  
Makin' apologies but she loves him desperately  
Oh but now and again she wished he'd been a poet  
So he'd know all the perfect lines to say  
And have some great romantic way to show it  
Be the hero ridin' up to save the day  
And go ridin' high like a knight in shinin' armor  
To sweep her up and carry her away  
Oh but he don't have no magic ways to charm her  
No cause even love can't change a cowboy's ways  
"I love you" and "I'm sorry" are words that just don't come  
Cause words like that are no match for the kind that rule his tongue  
But his eyes keep tellin' her "you know I love you anyway  
No matter what I say or what I never say"  
Oh but now and again she wished he'd been a poet  
So he'd know all those fancy lines to say  
And have some great romantic way to show it  
Be the hero ridin' up to save the day  
And go ridin' high like a knight in shinin' armor  
And sweep her up and carry her away  
Oh but he don't have no magic ways to charm her  
No cause even love can't change a cowboy's ways  
His ways seem cold but she knows he's much warmer  
But even love can't change a cowboy's ways  
He's just a fool that must defend his honor  
But even love can't change a cowboy's ways  

Loving you isn't good for me you keep my tears flowing  
If I loved you I couldn't stay gone so there's no use in going  
Loving you is a habit I can't break  
I haven't found a way yet but I've been tryin'  
To stop loving you but I can't wait there's no use a lyin'  
Loving you is a habit I can't break  
Loving you is a habit I can't break  
I've been loving you much too long now to change the way I feel  
So I might as well get used to these heartaches  
Loving you is a habit I can't break  
[ piano ]  
(A habit I can't break)  
Loving you is a habit I can't break...  
Loving you is a habit I can't break

Can't say we're lovers, can't say we're friends  
Don't even know if i'll see you again  
But against your warm body I felt so alive  
And you got me over a heartache tonight  
My heart was broken, my hurt was deep  
I had lost something I wanted to keep  
Lookin' for comfort when you caught my eye  
And you got me over a heartache tonight  
Chorus:  
  
Sweet conversation, a drink and a dance  
Led to an evening of making romance  
And I don't even care if it's wrong or it's right  
'cause you got me over a heartache tonight  
  
2nd chorus:  
  
Yes, you got me over a heartache tonight  
Stirring up passion brought me back to life  
Oh, and it may not last, but who know it just might  
But you got me over a heartache tonight  
Yes, you got me over a heartache tonight

Oh you took your sweet love from me oh you left me sweet sweet memories  
And I cry I cry like a little baby cause there's still a lot of you left in me  
Oh there's still a lot of you left in me and I cry cause your love'll set me
free  
Your love'll set me free  
I'll keep holding on to love that used to be cause there's still a lot of you
left in me  
  
Oh I still go on to all our favorite places and I still see all our friends we
used to see  
Oh but I'm thinkin' now I'm just not the same without you  
And that there's still a lot of you left in me  
Oh there's still a lot of you...  
Cause there's still a lot of you left in me

(Dolly Parton)  
You look at me that way  
I know what your eyes say  
Your eyes reflect love and desire  
I see that you need me  
I need you to please me  
You touch me and set me on fire  
It's the way that you love me  
The way that you touch me  
The way that you whisper my name  
I cannot resist you  
Each time I kiss you  
Then everything goes up in flames  
Baby I'm burning out of control  
Baby I'm burning body and soul  
Hot as a pistol of flaming desire  
Baby I'm burning  
You got me on fire  
I'm on fire  
This red hot emotion  
Puts fireworks in motion  
It looks like the fourth of July  
There's no use in fighting  
The fire you've ignited  
Just stand back and watch the sparks fly  
Baby I'm burning out of control  
Baby I'm burning body and soul  
Hot as a pistol of flaming desire  
Baby I'm burning  
You got me on fire  
Baby I'm burning  
Baby I'm burning  
Baby I'm burning  
Baby I'm burning  
Baby I'm burning out of control  
Baby I'm burning body and soul  
Hot as a pistol of flaming desire  
Baby I'm burning  
You got me on fire  
Baby I'm burning out of control  
Baby I'm burning body and soul  
Hot as a pistol of flaming desire  
Baby I'm burning  
You got me on fire  
Baby I'm burning out of control  
Baby I'm burning body and soul  
Hot as a pistol of flaming desire  
Baby I'm burning  
You got me on fire  

I grew up poor and ragged, just a simple country girl.  
I wanted to be pretty more than anything in the world,  
Like Barbie or the models in the Fredricks' catalog.  
From rags to wishes in my dreams I could have it all.  
I'm just a backwoods Barbie, too much makeup, too much hair.  
Don't be fooled by thinkin' that the goods are not all there.  
Don't let these false eyelashes lead you to believe that  
I'm as shallow as I look 'cause I run true and deep.  
  
I've always been misunderstood because of how I look.  
Don't judge me by the cover 'cause I'm a real good book.  
So read into it what you will, but see me as I am.  
The way I look is just a country girl's idea of glam.  
  
I'm just a backwoods Barbie in a push-up bra and heels.  
I might look artificial, but where it counts I'm real.  
And I'm all dolled up and hopin' for a chance to prove my worth,  
And even backwoods Barbie's get their feelings hurt.  
  
I'm just a backwoods Barbie, too much makeup, too much hair.  
Don't be fooled by thinkin' that the goods are not all there.  
Yes, I can see where I could be misjudged upon first glance,  
But even backwoods Barbie's deserve a second chance.  
I'm just a backwoods Barbie just asking for a chance,  
Just a backwoods Barbie.

  
Fighting soldiers from the sky  
Fearless men who jump and die  
Men who mean just what they say  
The brave men of the Green Beret  
  
1st Chorus:  
  
Silver wings upon their chest  
These are men, America's best  
One hundred men we'll test today  
But only three win the Green Beret  
  
Trained to live, off nature's land  
Trained in combat, hand to hand  
Men who fight by night and day  
Courage deep from the Green Beret  
  
Repeat 1st Chorus  
  
Delta Force and CIA  
Marines and SOCOM clear the way  
Covert missions now in play  
Special OPS like the Green Beret  
  
Repeat 1st Chorus  
  
While back at home a young wife waits  
Her Green Beret has met his fate  
He has died for those oppressed  
Leaving her this last request  
  
2nd Chorus:  
  
Put silver wings on my son's chest  
Make him one of America's best  
He'll be a man they'll test one day  
So have him win the Green Beret  
Have him win the Green Beret  
  
Repeat 1st Chorus  
  

I went into his prison cell  
To write his story, if he'd tell  
He spoke as tears, fell from his eyes  
And he told me when, and how and why  
And he said  
  
I asked my love to take a walk  
Just to walk, a little ways  
And as we walked, then we could talk  
About our future wedding day  
  
But when she said, she could never be mine  
Well I held a knife against her breast  
As into my arms she pressed  
She cried "my love, don't you murder me  
'Cause I'm not prepared for eternity"  
  
Then only say that you'll be mine  
And in no others' arms entwine  
Down beside where the waters flow  
Down by the banks of the Ohio  
  
I started home twixt twelve and one  
I cried, "My God, what have I done?"  
I've killed the one I love tonight  
Because she would not be my bride  
  
Well only say that you'll be mine  
And in no others' arms entwine  
Down beside where the waters flow  
Down by the banks of the Ohio  
Down by the banks of the Ohio  
  
Save my soul Lord  
Save my soul  
There beside where the waters flow  
Down by the banks of the Ohio

(Dolly Parton)  
Last night you called me Barbara  
As you lay fast asleep  
And although I'm not Barbara  
You wanted me to be  
You whispered words I haven't heard  
In such a long, long time  
Last night you said I love you  
With Barbara on your mind  
Sometimes I find traces of her kisses on your skin  
And strands of chestnut hair  
That say you've been with her again  
Little traces of her that it breaks my heart to find  
Last night you called me darlin'  
With Barbara on your mind  
With Barbara on your mind  
You held me in your arms so tight  
And lying there so close to you  
I cried until day light  
And though you think that I don't know  
I'm really not that blind  
Last night you said I love you  
With Barbara on your mind  
Last night you called me darlin'  
With Barbara on your mind  

Everytime the bluebird sings  
My heart takes wings to the sky  
The bluebird greyside fly  
To my place in your eyes  
Cause after all, I did all I could  
And you did your best, just the same  
Nobody won, we both lost, no one's to blame  
But I'll fly away to you, if only pretending  
We'll be like bluebird do, the beautiful lie  
The beautiful lie, the beautiful lie  
Everytime the bluebird sings  
My heart takes wings to the sky  
The bluebird greyside fly  
To my place in your eyes  
Cause after all, I did all I could  
And you did your best, just the same  
Nobody won, we both lost, no one's to blame  
But I'll find my way to you, if I'm only pretending  
And we'll be like bluebirds, live the beautiful lie  
We'll be like bluebirds, live the beautiful lie

I lie in bed beside you and watch you while you sleep  
And wonder who I was before I loved you  
Lying here beside you feeling so complete  
Thinking how I love and need and trust you  
Because I love you I'm a brand new person now because you love me  
I can face the world and have the cause I love you  
Because you love me because I love you  
  
Sweeter even still is knowing that you're lying there  
And let you soon awake and reach to hold me  
And anyway you want me that's the way that I am yours  
Love as strong as this lets you control me  
Because I love you...  
Because I love you...

If she brings you happiness  
Then I wish you both the best  
It's your happiness that matters most of all  
But if she ever breaks your heart  
If the teardrops ever start  
I'll be there before the next teardrop falls  
  
Though it hurts to let you go  
Darling I want you to know  
I'll run to you if ever you should call  
And if I should ever hear  
That she's made you shed a tear  
I'll be there before the next teardrop falls  
  
I'll be there anytime you need me by your side  
To dry away each teardrop you've cried  
If she ever leaves you blue  
Just remember I love you  
And I'll be there  
Before the next teardrop falls  
  
All I Estare Candor me necesites a tu lado  
Para borrar cadda lagrima que haya llorado  
If he ever leaves you blue  
Just remember I love you  
And I'll be there  
Before the next teardrop falls  
  
I'll be there, I'll be there  
Before the next teardrop falls

Before you make up your mind to leave me  
Before you make up your mind to walk out the door  
Before you telle me that it's all over  
Let me say what I have to say it won't take me all day  
And if you still wanna leave don't stay for I won't try to hold you anymore  
Does she really love you way that I love you  
Does she treat you right even when you've done wrong  
If she's woman enough to forgive you way that I'm willing to  
If she ain't then don't go for I still love you so we all make mistakes I know  
Give these thoughts a little time before you make up your mind  
[ guitar ]  
Does she really love you way that I love you  
Will she treat you right even when you do wrong  
If she's woman enough to forgive you way that I'm willing to  
If she ain't then don't go for I still love you so we all make mistakes I know  
Give these thoughts a little time before you make up your mind  
Give these thoughts a little time before you make up your mind  
  
  

My baby makes me proud  
Lord, don't he make me proud  
He never makes a scene  
Hangin' all over me in a crowd  
'Cause people like to talk  
Lord, don't they love to talk  
But when they turn out the lights  
I know he'll be leavin' with me  
  
And when we get behind closed doors  
Then we let out hair hang down  
Then he makes me glad that he's my man  
And no one knows what goes on behind closed doors  
  
My baby makes me smile  
Lord, don't he make me smile  
I'm never far away  
Or too tired to say I want to  
I'm purring like a kitten  
When he's out in public with me  
But when they turn out the lights  
He brings out the tiger in me  
  
And when we get behind closed doors  
Then we let out hair hang down  
Then he makes me glad that he's my man  
And no one knows what goes on behind closed doors  
  
Behind closed doors

Who do you think you are  
What do you think this is  
A game you can play tryin' to steal him away  
Well I don't need a heartache like this  
Well don't think I don't go through hell  
But heaven is what we both want  
He's easy to love but he's hard to give up  
And if you think I will well you're wrong  
The best woman wins I will fight 'til the end  
I'll lay down and die if I must  
I'll beg and I'll plead I will suffer and bleed  
But he must make a choice between us  
This soap opera play that we're in  
Is just like you watch on t.v.  
But I never thought that I'd ever get caught in it  
Starring you him and me  
In love as in war all is fair  
So a fight to the finish begins  
When you fight from desire you fight fire with fire  
So may the best woman win  
The best woman wins I will fight 'til the end  
I'll lay down and die if I must  
I'll beg and I'll plead I will suffer and bleed  
But he must make a choice between us  
So may the best woman win  
May the best woman win  
May the best woman win  
I'll never give up or give in  
So may the best woman win (best woman win)  
The best woman win (best woman win)  
The best woman win (best woman win)  
I'll never give up or give in  
So may the best woman win  
May the best woman win  
May the best woman win (best woman win)  
I'll never give up or give in  
So may the best woman win  

I was blue ain't sky and sea  
Some of that blue's bound to get on me  
But the blues don't come to stay  
They'll move away on a better day  
  
Troubles, and woes and misery  
Ain't gonna get the best of me  
Lift the shades, fix my gaze  
On a better day, clear the way  
  
Better days just up ahead  
When sorrow ain't sleeping in my bed  
When people ain't messing with my head  
There's a better way, there's a brighter day  
  
There's a better day with clearer skies  
Hope and promise on the rise  
Oh the future is looking bright  
On those better days, look away, look away  
  
Better day oh  
  
Better days just up ahead  
When sorrow ain't sleeping in my bed  
And people ain't messing with my head  
There's a better day, there's a better day  
  
I was blue it ain't sky and sea  
Some of that blue's gonna fall on me  
Oh the future's looking bright  
There's a better bay  
Look away, look away

People always comin' up to me and askin'  
"Dolly, what's your secret?  
With all you do, your attitude  
Just seems to be so good  
How do you keep it?"  
Well, I'm not the Dalai Lama, but I'll try  
To offer up a few words of advice  
  
[Chorus]  
You better get to livin', givin'  
Don't forget to throw in a little forgivin'  
And lovin' on the way  
You better get to knowin', showin'  
A little bit more concerned about where you're goin'  
Just a word unto the wise  
You better get to livin'  
  
A girlfriend came to my house  
Started cryin' on my shoulder Sunday evening  
She was spinnin' such a sad tale  
I could not believe the yarn that she was weavin'  
So negative the words she had to say  
I said if I had a violin I'd play  
  
I said you'd better get to livin', givin'  
Be willing and forgivin'  
Cause all healing has to start with you  
You better stop whining, pining  
Get your dreams in line  
And then just shine, design, refine  
Until they come true  
  
And you better get to livin'  
  
Your life's a wreck, your house is mess  
And your wardrobe way outdated  
All your plans just keep on falling through  
Overweight and under paid, under appreciated  
I'm no guru, but I'll tell you  
This I know is true.  
  
You better get to livin', givin'  
A little more thought about bein'  
A little more willin' to make a better way  
Don't sweat the small stuff  
Keep your chin up  
Just hang tough  
And if it gets too rough  
Fall on your knees and pray  
And do that everyday  
Then you'll get to livin'  
  
The day we're born we start to die  
Don't waste one minute of this life  
Get to livin'  
Share your dreams and share your laughter  
Make some points for the great hereafter  
  
Better start carin'  
Better start sharin'  
Better start tryin'  
Better start smiling  
And you better get to livin'...

We're all together once again  
For the first time in I don't know when  
We were so close once upon a time  
There were five of us kids at home  
Two girls, three boys and Dad and Mom  
But that was in the better part  
Of life we left behind  
Remember that old swimming hole  
Where we would swim so long ago  
And all them possum grapes and muskedines  
And do you recall the time  
We all got drunk on homemade wine  
That was in the better part  
Of life we left behind  
  
Life was simple for us then  
If only it could be again  
How I wish we could go back in time  
But time moves on and nothin' lasts  
Except the memories from the past  
Memories from the better part  
Of life we left behind  
  
Remember how we talked as kids  
Of what we'd be when we got big  
And all the dreams that we held in our minds  
I wanted to be a singin' star  
And you all said that I'd go far  
But that was in the better part  
Of life we left behind  
  
Remember all the fun we had  
Back when they say times were bad  
And life was good to us and things were fine  
We had fun and we had love  
And a mom and dad to care for us  
But that was is the better part  
Of life we left behind  
  
Life was simple for us then  
If only it could be again  
How I wish we could go back in time  
But time moves on and nothin' lasts  
Except the memories from the past  
Memories from the better part  
Of life we left behind  
Sweet memories from the better part  
Of life we left behind

Big wind big wind's comin'  
From daylight till dusk we've been a workin' in the dust  
Pickin' cotton workin' side by side  
Oh I can't forget I still remember yet the way my daddy looked at me and cried  
Big wind's a comin' listen to the hummin' hurry up now be quick don't stall  
You know we can't be slow take the kids and get below  
If we don't hurry it'll surely get us all  
  
I ran across the field so scared my lips was scaled  
To warn my mom to storm was on its way  
Now I knew I'd won the race when I'd see my mama's face  
And the way she looked at me and said  
Big wind's a comin'  
  
Oh but dad was on the cellar and by now the sky was yellow  
The wind was blowin' trees were fallin'  
And outside I heard him cryin' and as he lay there dyin'  
It seemed I could still hear him sayin'  
Big wind's a comin'  
Big wind big wind's comin'

(Dolly Parton)  
In my home town of Blackie, Kentucky  
He came passin' through one dark, gloomy day  
And I considered myself as lucky  
When he told me he would take me away  
And though he was older, it made me no difference  
His promise of riches was all I could see  
At last I could leave the coal mines of Kentucky  
And know something better than sad poverty  
Blackie, Kentucky, you know that I'll miss you  
But there are other places in the world I'd like to see  
So I must take this chance to be somethin' more than nothin'  
But I'll always hold you in my memory  
But I've never adjusted to sociable livin'  
The friends that he knows, they're all strangers to me  
Thousands of miles from Blackie, Kentucky  
In a mansion with a husband that never loved me  
He won't let my family and friends come to visit  
Because they are country and poor, he's ashamed  
Oh, but I'd give my life, Lord, if I could just go see them  
All that's changed about me is my name  
Blackie, Kentucky, oh Lord, how I miss you  
If I could come back home, I'd never leave you anymore  
I'd like to see my poor, hardworking, coal-minin' Daddy  
And Mama, and the kids, and the friends I knew before  
My world is as black as the coal in Kentucky  
He won't let me leave him - there's no way to win  
I'll take my own life, dear God, please forgive me  
But I've got to get back home to Blackie once again  
An' I've left him a note, in the mornin' he'll find it  
It's my last request and he can't refuse me  
I've told him to bury me back in Blackie, Kentucky  
Where my family and my friends can come and visit me  
Blackie, Kentucky I'm comin' home to you  
But different from the way you remember me before  
So make me a place and I'll lay me down to rest  
And I'll sleep in your arms forevermore  
I'll sleep in your arms forever more  

(Dolly Parton)  
Blue me, blue me  
Blue is the color  
That fits best on me  
I'm blue  
Just as blue as can be  
Blue me, Blue me  
I cry  
And I die  
I lie awake at night  
And I question why  
Must it be  
I can never be free  
Blue me, Blue me  
My heart is heavy  
But it's empty inside  
No one to love me  
Or to lay down beside  
I'm blue  
The queen of sorrow  
Wears royal blue  
My luck ain't changin'  
Is it ever goin' to  
I'm blue, Oh I'm blue  
Why must I wear this robe of blue misery  
Blue me, Blue me  
Ooh  
This sad old feeling  
Is breakin' me down  
No satisfaction with these blues hangin' 'round  
Lord, I'm blue  
Oh, I'm so blue Why can't I shake it tell me where will this end  
When will I get out of this blue rut I'm in  
Oh, I'm blue  
Looks like the blues just took a liking to me  
Blue me, Blue me Blue me, Blue me  
Blue is the color that fits best on me  
Ooooh, I'm blue  
I'm just as blue as can be  
Blue me  
Blue me  

Blue smoke climbin' up the mountain  
Blue smoke windin' round the bend  
Blue smoke is the name of the heartbreak train  
That I am ridin' in  
I left a note I wrote I'm leaving  
And I won't be coming back  
Blue smoke rolling, rolling, rolling  
Rolling, rolling down the track  
Oh, click-ad-ee, click-ad-ee, click-ad-ee clack  
Just stay on track an' never look back  
Choo-choo, choo-choo, woo-woo-woo  
Blue smoke is comin' through  
  
Oh I know I'm gonna miss you  
But I hope it ain't for long  
And I wonder if you're even gonna notice that I'm gone  
Oh it hurts to know you cheated  
And it hurt to know you lied  
But it hurts me even worse to know you never even tried  
  
I packed my suitcase full of heartaches  
Headin' to the train depot  
And I bought a one-way ticket  
On that train they call Blue Smoke  
I left the station straight-up midnight  
Feelin' lonely, lost and blue  
In a trail of blue smoke with my heart broke  
Said good-bye to you  
  
Blue smoke climbin' up the mountain  
Blue smoke windin' round the bend  
Blue smoke is the name of the heartbreak train  
That I am ridin' in  
I left a note I wrote I'm leaving  
And I won't be coming back  
Blue smoke rolling, rolling, rolling  
Rolling, rolling down the track  
Oh, click-ad-ee, click-ad-ee, click-ad-ee clack  
Just stay on track an' never look back  
Choo-choo, choo-choo, woo-woo-woo  
Blue smoke is comin' through

She was born in a place called Blue Valley  
At the foot of the Tennessee hills  
With the blue birds and blue bells  
And blue mountain water  
And the sound of the Blue Whippoorwill  
But there was no peace in the valley  
Her daddy, a cruel, ruthless man  
Used and abused her mind and her body  
So her mama said run while you can  
So at fifteen she took to the highway  
Belongings and guitar in hand  
And she buried herself in her music  
The one thing she did understand  
  
And she sings like a bird and she writes like a poet  
Her voice has that high, lonesome sound  
She hurts, and her songs are the best way to show it  
So the Blue Valley songbird keeps traveling around  
  
She hopes someday she will make it  
And everyone says that she will  
When she comes to town, crowds flock around  
To see the girl from the Tennessee hills  
She writes her letter back home to her mama  
In care of the preacher in town  
They're sacred to her so she reads them at church  
And so her daddy cannot track her down  
  
And she sings like a bird and she cries like a baby  
Whenever she turns off the lights  
She's a whole lot lonesome and a little bit crazy  
From mem'ries and miseries and dreams gone awry  
  
Blue dress, blue shoes, a blue Cadillac  
A band dressed in blue by her side  
Instruments tied to the top and the back  
'Cause the Blue Valley songbird is singing tonight  
  
One nighters, honky tonks, years flying by  
She never made it, but Lord knows she tries  
Expressing the feelings she holds inside  
And the Blue Valley songbird is singing tonight  
Oh the Blue Valley songbird is singing tonight  
  
And she sings like a bird and she writes like a poet

(Dolly Parton)  
I was lookin' for greener pastures  
When I left my old Kentucky home  
I was chasin' after dreams I thought I'd master  
So I left the one that loved me all along  
Thinkin' only of myself and doin' better  
Didn't care about the grief I left behind  
Didn't even make a card or write a letter  
So sure I'd be successful in no time  
Now I'm heading for bluer pastures  
And back to the one who's heart I broke  
To the bluegrass state of Kentucky  
Where he waits with open for me I hope  
Ain't it funny how you are when you're younger?  
How what you have is never good enough  
How the years will find you searchin' through your plunder  
Lookin' for the treasures you gave up  
Well the seasons came, they went  
The dreams all shattered  
While the grass just stayed a lonely shade of brown  
Then I realized I'd lost all that had mattered  
So with foolish pride aside, I'm homeward bound  
Now I'm heading for bluer pastures  
And back to the one who's heart I broke  
To the bluegrass state of ole Kentucky  
Where he waits with open for me I hope  
Now I'm heading for bluer pastures  
Where the bluegrass waves sweetly in the wind  
Where the bluegrass music's always playin'  
To the haunting sound of Monroe's mandolin  
I'm heading for bluer pastures  

(Dolly Parton)  
Bobby's arms, they are warm when he holds me  
Bobby's arms always comfort and console me  
When I'm in his arms held tight  
I know everything's alright  
Just as long as I'm inside bobby's arms  
Chorus:  
Bobby's arms always welcome me inside  
Bobby's arms always hold me when I cry  
Bobby's arms are my shelter from life's storms  
And I feel so safe in Bobby's arms  
Bobby's arms, they are strong but they're tender  
Bobby's arms reach for me and I surrender  
When he reaches out for me, I'm never out of reach  
And I always want to be in Bobby's arms  
Repeat Chorus  

(feat. Judy Collins and Rhonda Vincent)  
  
Rows and floes of angel hair  
And ice cream castles in the air  
And feather canyons ev'rywhere  
I've looked at clouds that way  
  
But now they only block the sun  
They rain and snow on ev'ryone  
So many things I would have done  
But clouds got in my way  
I've looked at clouds from both sides now  
From up and down, and still somehow  
It's cloud illusions I recall  
I really don't know clouds at all  
  
Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels  
The dizzy dancing way you feel  
As ev'ry fairy tale comes real  
I've looked at love that way  
  
But now it's just another show  
You leave 'em laughing when you go  
And if you care, don't let them know  
Don't give yourself away  
  
I've looked at love from both sides now  
From give and take, and still somehow  
It's love's illusions I recall  
I really don't know love at all  
  
Tears and fears and feeling proud  
To say "I love you" right out loud  
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds  
I've looked at life that way  
  
But now old friends are acting strange  
They shake their heads, they say I've changed  
Well something's lost, but something's gained  
In living ev'ry day  
  
I've looked at life from both sides now  
From win and lose and still somehow  
It's life's illusions I recall  
I really don't know life at all  
I've looked at life from both sides now  
From up and down, and still somehow  
It's life's illusions I recall  
I really don't know life at all

I don't want to hear a love song  
I got on this airplane just to fly  
I know there's life below me  
And all that you can show me is the prairie and the sky  
I don't want to hear a sad story filled with heartbreak and desire  
The last time I felt like this  
I was in the wilderness and the canyon was on fire  
And I stood on the mountain in the night  
And I watched it burn, I watched it burn, I watched it burn  
  
I would rock my soul in the bosom of Abraham  
I would hold my life in a saving grace  
I would walk all the way from Boulder to Birmingham  
If I thought I could see, see your face  
  
Well you really got me this time  
And the hardest part is knowing I survive  
And I've come to listen to the sounds of trucks  
As they moved out on Highway 95  
And pretending it's the ocean coming to wash me clear  
To wash me clear if you know what I mean  
  
I would rock my soul in the bosom of Abraham  
I would hold my life in a saving grace  
I would walk all the way from Boulder to Birmingham  
If I thought I could see, see your face

You're the one that puts the sparkle in my eyes  
You're the one that puts the laughter in my smile  
You're the one that puts the meaning in my life  
And I'm bubblin' over, bubblin' over, bubblin' over  
Because you are mine  
Bubblin' over with the joy that only love can bring  
Bubblin' over with the song you taught my heart to sing  
And I'm so happy lovin' you that anyone can see  
That I'm bubblin' over, bubblin' over, bubblin' over  
Because you love me  
I have never known a love that felt like this  
You're the one I want to share my lovin' with  
Your gentle way of lovin' me and your thoughtfulness  
Keeps me bubblin' over, bubblin' over, bubblin' over with happiness  
Bubblin' over with the joy that only love can bring  
Bubblin' over with the song you taught my heart to sing  
And I'm so happy lovin' you that anyone could see  
That I'm bubblin' over, bubblin' over, bubblin' over  
Because you love me  
Yes, I'm bubblin' over, I'm bubblin' over, I'm bubblin' over  
'Cause you love me  

(Dolly Parton)  
When I look at you  
I melt like a candle  
You light a fire in me  
What am I to do  
I just hope I can handle  
The heat and the smoke blinding me  
This feeling, this fire  
This burning desire  
Is raging its way through my soul  
And if you feel the same  
Help me fan the flames  
'Til we're burning out of control  
Burning to know you  
Burning to show you  
And I've felt this way from the start  
Burning with passion  
I do hope it's lasting  
And it's burning a hole in my heart  
You kindle in me  
A warm glowing feeling  
A spark and a flicker of hope  
It's more than a game  
And like moths to a flame  
We're drawn to its warmth and its glow  
These embers of love  
Are fueled by the notion  
This could be an eternal flame  
Consumed by the blaze  
I fear it's too late  
'Cause this torch that I hold bears your name  
Oh, and I'm burning to know you  
Burning to hold you  
It's grown to a flame from a spark  
Burning with passion  
I do hope it's lasting  
And it's burning a hole in my heart  
Oh, I'm burning with passion  
I do hope it's lasting...  
I've had so many dreams fall apart...  
And it's burning a hole in my heart...  
I'm burning  
Oh, I'm burning  
Mmmm, I'm burning oh, I burning ooh  

(Dolly Parton)  
Busy signal  
That's what I get when I call you  
Busy busy  
Talking to someone new  
I wish I knew  
I shouldn't worry 'cause it's probably his mother  
Or then again it could even be his little brother  
On the line  
Making me lose my mind  
Hang up hang up hang up hang up  
Come on hang up hang up hang up  
Gotta talk to my baby  
Gotta tell him I'm sorry  
Busy signal  
How can I tell him I'm sorry  
When I said I didn't care  
I didn't mean a word I said  
Talking outta my head  
I've got to reach him now and tell him that I love him  
And from now on I'll stay right by his side and love him  
All the time  
So please somebody quit tying up the line  
Hang up hang up hang up hang up  
Come on hang up hang up hang up  
Gotta talk to my baby  
Gotta tell him I'm sorry  
I didn't mean to hurt you baby  
I really really love you baby  

When the mornin' sun  
Streaks across my room  
And I'm wakin' up  
From another dream of you  
Yes, you know I'm on the road  
Once again it seems  
All that's left behind  
Is a chain of broken dreams  
  
But you know that I love you  
You know that I love you  
Oh, I love you  
  
And how I wish that love  
Was all we'd need to live  
What a life we'd have  
'Cause I've got so much to give  
But ya' know I feel so sad  
Down inside my heart  
That the dollar sign  
Should be keepin' us apart  
  
But you know that I love you  
You know that I love you  
Oh, how I love you  
  
And if only I could find my way back to the time  
When the problems of this life  
Had not yet crossed my mind  
And the answers could be found in children's nursery rhymes  
I'd come runnin' back to you  
I'd come runnin' back to you  
  
But you know we can't  
Live on dreams alone  
Got to pay the rent  
So I must leave you all alone  
'Cause you know I made my choice many years ago  
And now this travelin' life  
Well, it's the only life I know  
  
But you know that I love you  
You know that I love you  
Oh, I love you  
But you know that I love you  
You know that I love you  
Oh, how I love you  
But you know that I love you  
You know that I love you  
Oh, how I love you  
  
But you know I love you  
But you know I love you  
Oh, I love you  
But you know that I love you  
But you know that I love you  
Oh, how I love you  
But you know that I love you  
But you know that I love you  
Oh, how I love you

Remember all the castles that we once built in the sand  
Remember how we used to go and visit fairy land  
Remember how we'd search for that pot of gold at the rainbow's end  
But you loved me then  
And the flowers the we picked from the fields where we did run  
And the sunbeams that we'd catch from the summer's golden sun  
And the butterflies we'd chase as we'd go running through the wind  
But you loved me then  
Now I walk through the ruins of our castles in the sand  
When you left I lost my way forever and the fairy land  
Now the rainbows have all gone and the flowers have all died  
And the sunbeams that we caught have all gone free again  
And the butterfiles we chased have all gone with the wind  
And you no longer care but you love me then  
(And you no longer care) but you love me then  
(And you no longer care) but you love me then  
  
  

(Dolly Parton)  
I would spin for you a blanket  
Out of gold and silver threads  
I would let my gentle bosom  
Be a pillow for your head  
I'd caress your perfect body  
On a rosy bed at night  
Play you love songs on a golden harp  
And sing you Butterflies  
In a diamond-studded chalice  
On an emerald-plated tray  
I would bring to you sweet nectar  
And gifts of bright array  
I would paint for you a castle  
In a blue and yellow sky  
Paint you happy ever after  
And paint you Butterflies  
Butterflies, my heart flutters with the notion  
I get high on the wings of sweet emotion  
Darling I, I just think of you and I get butterflies  
I get close to you and I get butterflies  
If only I were magic  
I would make the wishes true  
I would wave a magic wand  
And be in Paradise with you  
But I'm just a girl that loves you  
I will love you all my life  
But I do have a magic feeling  
And it gives me butterflies  
Butterflies, my heart flutters with the notion  
I get high on the wings of sweet emotion  
Darling I, I just think of you and I get butterflies  
We should fly away together, you and I  
Off to paradise forever, I get high  
I get close to you and I get butterflies  
I think of you and I get butterflies  
I will spin for you a blanket out of gold and silver threads  
If only I were magic, I would make the wishes true  
I would wave a magic wand and be in paradise with you  

(Dolly Parton)  
In a dream I was walkin' in a beautiful field  
I was gathering flowers at the foot of a hill  
When a bright light descended and it spread o'er the land  
Jesus stood on the mountain and He held out His hand  
Then He came down from the mountain, headed down to the sea  
And the children strowed flowers in the path at His feet  
And He was filled with compassion and the beasts from the wild  
Came as gentle as lambs and they all walked at His side  
There's a calm on the water, a hush in the crowd  
There's peace in the valley, there's a stillness about  
There's a light in the darkness, there's joy in His love  
Ain't that a wonderful feelin', let us lift Him up  
Then He suddenly vanished from the crowd down below  
Reappeared on the mountain in a radiant glow  
He said your questions are many but the answer is love  
I'll draw all men unto me if I be lifted up  
There's a calm on the water, a hush in the crowd  
There's peace in the valley, there's a stillness about  
There's a light in the darkness, there's joy in His love  
There is life everlasting, let us lift Him up  
He said if I  
Be lifted up  
He said if I be lifted up, what did he say  
He said if I  
Be lifted up  
He said if I be lifetd up  
Let's lift Him higher and higher  
And higher and higher each day  
Let's lift Him up  
He said if I  
Be lifted up  
Oh if I be lifted up  
There's a calm on the water, a hush in the crowd  
There's peace in the valley, there's a stillness about  
There's a light in the darkness, and joy in His love  
It's a wonderful feelin', lift Him up  
He said if I  
Be lifted up  
He said if I be lifted up, that's what he said  
He said if I  
Be lifted up  
If I be lifted up  

I got in a little trouble at the county seat  
Lord, they put me in the jailhouse  
For loafing on the street  
Well, the judge said guilty  
He made his point  
He said forty-five dollars  
Or thirty days in the joint  
  
That'll be cash on the barrelhead, hun  
You can take your choice  
You're twenty-one  
No money down  
No credit plan  
No time to chase you  
'Cause I'm a busy man  
  
I found a telephone number on a laundry slip  
I had a good, hardy jailor  
With a six gun hip  
He let me call long distance  
She said, "Number, please"  
And just as soon as I told her  
She shouted back at me  
  
Said that'll be cash on the barrelhead, hun  
Not part, not half  
But the entire sum  
No money down  
No credit line  
'Cause a little boy tells me  
You're the travelin' kind  
  
Thirty days in the jailhouse  
Four days on the road  
I was feelin' mighty hungry  
My feet, a heavy load  
I saw a Greyhound comin'  
Stuck out my thumb  
As soon as I was seated  
The driver caught my arm  
  
Said that'll be cash on the barrelhead, hun  
This old, grey dog gets paid to run  
When the engine starts  
And the wheels will roll  
Give me cash on the barrelhead  
I take ya down the road  
Ohh, cash on the barrelhead  
I take you down the road

(Dolly Parton)  
Someday when I'm over you  
And when I think I'm able to  
Well, I might try to be  
Your friend again  
But your restless heart  
And rovin' eyes  
My jealousy, these endless fights  
I've got to get out of your life  
Or I will never mend  
I guess I'll die a bit each day  
But I'm always dying anyway  
And I don't have the heart to  
Stay, and I can't take the pain  
I know we've tried to no avail  
Our heaven now has  
Turned to hell  
The same old hurt  
We know so well  
And something's got  
To change  
We both know it's got to end  
The passion's gone  
It's just pretend  
And one of us have got  
To make the move  
We might as well just give it up  
We've lost respect and  
There's no trust  
And without this, there's  
No real love  
It's just some sad excuse  
I guess I'll die a bit each day  
But I'm always dying anyway  
And there's nothing left but walk away  
Ain't this a crying shame  
A change of pace  
A change of heart  
A change of place  
A place to start  
And we'll be better off apart  
Our only chance is change  
And we never wil  
But something has to change  
But someday when I'm over you  
And when I think I'm able to  
Then I will try to be your friend again  
But I don't want to see  
Your face 'til then  
Change, I need a change  
I need a change  
We need a change  

You're the sweetest one I know and I just can't let you go  
I just dream of holding you inside my arms  
I go home each night to stay but I just can't stay away  
And we get closer closer by the hour  
We get closer by the hour though we've tried with all our power  
To stay away from each other's arms  
We get closer by the hour like the bee goes to the flower  
Closer closer by the hour  
We come closer with each kiss and I feel your lips insist  
But I do your will and love you more and more  
Although we know it's wrong we can't stay where we belong  
And we get closer closer by the hour  
We get closer by the hour...  
  
  

You ask me not to wear cologne  
She'll know you've been with me alone  
And you can't take our secret home  
So you ask me not to wear cologne  
  
You can wipe the make up off  
The lipstick or a little gloss  
But fragrance lingers on and on  
So you ask me not to wear cologne  
  
You leave my bed and go to hers  
Leaving me alone and hurt  
I love you whether right or wrong  
And you ask me not to wear cologne  
  
I'm not out to hurt someone  
Not you, not her, not any one  
But I got heartaches of my own  
Why, I can't even wear cologne  
  
Oh but I never meant for this to be  
It wasn't in my heart to cheat  
Love has a nature all it's own  
So I willingly gave up cologne  
  
And every time you come to me  
I realize I'm in too deep  
I know you love us both and I keep holding on  
You ask me not to wear cologne  
  
You say, "Don't wear cologne"  
  
Oh now what am I ever gonna do  
Cause I am so in love with you  
I know you love us both  
But where do I belong  
You ask me not to wear cologne  
  
You ask me not to wear cologne  
She'll know you've been with me alone  
And you can't take our secret home  
So you ask me not to wear cologne  
  
How do I walk away from the greatest love I've known  
You ask me not to wear cologne  
Oh you ask me not to wear cologne  
  
You ask me not to wear cologne  
She'll know you've been with me alone  
And I'm a scent you can't take home  
But will I ever get to wear cologne

(Porter Wagoner)  
Now and then, here and there, I still see you  
And sometimes my memory lets me hear your voice, so soft and low  
But like the wind you travel in, you seem to come and go  
At times, my mind is crystal clear  
And then I think of you  
Then the spin of the room I'm in  
Brings you into view  
Love that once  
Held my mind completely in control  
Now makes it spin like tornado wind  
As it comes and goes  
Well, look who's here  
I told myself that you'd be coming soon  
I hope that you can stay for a little while  
It's so lonesome in this room  
And you look just the same today  
Do you still love me so?  
What's that you say, you can't stay?  
You seem to come and go  
At times my mind is crystal clear  
And then I think of you  
Then the spin of the room I'm in  
Brings you into view  
Love that once  
Held my mind completely in control  
Now makes it spin like tornado winds  
As it comes and goes  

(Dolly Parton)  
A broken heart like a broken wing  
It must have its time to mend  
I am like a crippled bird  
In hopes one day to fly again  
I loved you so and I was faithful  
I cared more than words could say  
But love is cruel and life is hateful  
Now you've gone and flown away  
Oh, to die, 'Twould be a pleasure  
Slow to heal, but quick to cry  
Fragile as a sparrow's feather  
Crippled bird too blue to fly  
Oh, the loss is cold and shameful  
And the grief so deep and sharp  
There is nothing quite as painful  
As a true blue broken heart  
Oh, to die, 'Twould be a pleasure  
Slow to heal, but quick to cry  
Fragile as a sparrow's feather  
Crippled bird too blue to fly  
Fragile as a sparrow's feather  
Crippled bird too blue to fly  

Cry, cry darlin', that's what I'll do  
If you should leave me with the blues  
Cry, cry darlin', that's what I'll do  
If you're the one that I should lose  
  
For me there will be no moonlight  
If ever we should part  
Cry, cry darlin', that's all I'll do  
'Cause you're the one that's in my heart  
  
Cry, cry darlin', my eyes would cry  
And never dry if you should go  
Cry, cry darlin', when shadows creep  
I'll just weep all night I know  
  
You know how much I'd miss you  
If ever we should part  
Cry, cry darlin', that's all I'll do  
'Cause you're the one that's in my heart  
  
Oh, cry, cry darlin', that's all I'll do  
'Cause you're the one that's in my heart

Mama never seemed to miss the finer things in life  
If she did, she never did say so to daddy  
She never wanted to be more than mother and a wife  
If she did, she never did say so to daddy  
The only things that seemed to be  
Important in her life  
Was to make our house a home and make us happy  
Mama never wanted any more than what she had  
If she did, she never did say so to daddy  
  
He often left her all alone  
She didn't mind the stayin' home  
If she did, she never did say so to daddy  
And she never missed the flowers  
And the gifts he never gave her  
If she did, she never did say so to daddy  
  
Being took for granted  
Was a thing that she accepted  
And she didn't need those things to make her happy  
She didn't even seem to notice  
That he didn't kiss and hold her  
If she did, she never did say so to daddy  
  
One morning we awoke, just to find the note  
That mama carefully wrote and left to daddy  
And as he began to read it  
Our ears could not believe it  
The words that she had written there to daddy  
  
She said, "Our kids are old enough  
And they don't need me very much  
So I've gone in search for love I need so badly  
I have needed you so long  
But I just can't keep holdin' on"  
She never meant to come back home  
If she did, she never did say so to daddy  
  
Mama's gone  
Goodbye to daddy

(Dolly Parton)  
Daddy was an old time preacher man  
He preacher the word of God throughout the land  
He preached so plain a child could understand  
Yes, Daddy was an old time preacher man  
He told the people of he need to pray  
He talked about God's wrath and judgement day  
He preached about the great eternity  
He preached hell so hot that you could feel the heat  
Yes, Daddy was an old time preacher man  
Aunt Leanona would get up to testify  
And we'd sing "In The Sweet By And By"  
The we'd sing "I'm On My Way To Canaan Land"  
Yes, Daddy was an old time preacher man  
Revivals and camp meetings went for weeks  
Folks came from all around to hear him preach  
Daddy said if one is saved it's worth it all  
But the aisles were always filled at altar calls  
Yes, Daddy was an old time preacher man  
Daddy worked for God but asked for no pay  
For he believed that God provides a way  
We never had a lot but we got by  
Guess it's 'cause the Lord was on Daddy's side  
Yes, Daddy was an old time preacher man  

As I look around the little house we were so happy in  
I think of all the happy times we'll never see again  
Then I break down and start to cry, the children ask what for  
I can't find a way to tell them that Daddy won't be home anymore  
Each night before they go to sleep they fold their little hands  
And say a prayer for Daddy fighting in their far-off land  
So tonight I'll help them say their prayers like I've always done before  
God give me courage to tell them that Daddy won't be home anymore  
  
But honey as for me there'll never be another man  
And I'll bring our children up the best way that I can  
You died for what you thought was right that much I know for sure  
But the children just can't understand why Daddy won't be home anymore  
  
No the children just don't understand why Daddy won't be home anymore

Folks say my daddy wasn't much of a man  
For disobeying the laws of the land  
Folks say that my daddy wasn't fit to kill  
Oh and I know it was true what the people said  
Cause we'd all've been better of dead  
Than to live a life of shame and strife  
Cause of daddy's moonshine still  
My mama was always sweet and kind  
But she grew old before her time  
Worryin' about the way we had to live  
Yeah my daddy put the wrinkles in my mama's face  
He drunk his share of all he made  
And just one more reason I grew to hate  
My daddy's moonshine still  
Chorus:  
Daddy's moonshine still was good for nothin'  
But to break mama's heart  
And to tear our home apart  
Make our lives a livin' hell  
Them old mason jars that daddy made us wash  
And set them out to sun on our back porch  
'Til he got ready to take 'em up on the hill  
And when daddy got word of the revenue  
He made us kids help hide his brew  
Made us swear that we never knew  
About daddy's moonshine still  
Yeah and two of my brothers drove across the state line  
Once a week with a load of moonshine  
And the wounds that came from that won't ever heal  
Cause on a moonshine run one rainy night  
My two brothers lost their lives  
And oh my god how I despise  
My daddy's moonshine still  
Repeat Chorus  
Well it broke mama's heart but she understood  
The day that I left home for good  
But I had to find me another way to live  
Well I sent mama money nearly every day  
And how I made it, well I'd rather not say  
But at least it took me far away  
From daddy's moonshine still  
My bootlegging daddy was known quite well  
And he made our home a livin' hell  
And I ain't forgot it and I know that I never will  
My mama finally died she just gave up  
And daddy finally died from drinkin' that stuff  
And bad memories haunt the rest of us  
From daddy's moonshine still  
Repeat Chorus  

(Dolly Parton)  
My dear hard workin' daddy works his life away for us  
That's the way that daddy shows to us his love  
And Daddy's two hard working hands  
They're callous and they're sore  
And Daddy's workin' boots have walked a million miles or more  
As long as I remember, I remember Daddy workin'  
Workin' on the job or either on the farm  
Tryin' to provide for the family that he loves  
And Daddy's working boots have taken many steps for us  
Chorus:  
Daddy's workin' boots have served as his foundation  
Though just like him, they're tired and worn  
For years they've helped him stand  
Daddy's working boots have filled their obligation  
They've walked that rocky road with a mighty, mighty man  
Dear lord above, I know up there my Daddy's got a mansion  
And a great reward that's long been overdue  
And when it comes my Daddy's time to be with you in heaven  
Spoken:  
Won't cha let him walk your golden streets  
In a pair of brand new golden boots  
Repeat Chorus  
Daddy's workin' boots  

(Dolly Parton)  
Oh, you're out there tonight with another  
And my pain is so dreadfully sharp.  
I picture you with her and shudder,  
It's like a dagger through the heart  
Do you think that my feelings don't matter,  
Or your cheatin' or hurtful remarks  
When you leave me all broken and shattered  
It's like a dagger through the heart  
Oh, I know I'm a fool to keep stayin'  
When you've made hurtin' me such an art,  
Tossed around like a used box of crayons,  
It's like a dagger through the heart  
Oh, you cut me to pieces so often  
Like a knife or a poisonous dart  
I would be better off in my coffin,  
It's like a dagger through the heart  
Oh, I know I'm a fool to keep stayin'  
When you've made hurtin' me such an art,  
Tossed around like a used box of crayons,  
It's like a dagger through the heart  
Like a dagger through the heart, through the heart  
  

(Merle Travis)  
Come and listen you fellows  
So young and do fine  
And seek not your fortune  
In the dark, dreary mines  
  
It will form as a habit  
Seep in your soul  
'Til the blood in your veins  
Runs as black as the coal  
  
There's many a man  
That I've known in my day  
Who lived just to labor  
His whole life away  
  
Like a fiend with his dope  
And a drunkard his wine  
A man will have lust for  
The lure of the mine  
  
It's dark as a dungeon  
Damp as the dew  
The danger is double  
And the pleasures are few  
  
Where the rain never falls  
Where the sun never shines  
It's dark as a dungeon  
Way down in the mine  
  
I hope when I'm gone  
And the ages shall roll  
My body will blacken  
And turn into coal  
  
Then I'll look out the door  
Of my heavenly home  
And I'll pity the miners  
A-diggin' my bones  
  
It's dark as a dungeon  
Damp as the dew  
The danger is double  
And the pleasures are few  
  
Where the rain never falls  
Where the sun never shines  
It's dark as a dungeon  
Way down in the mine  
  
Where the rain never falls  
Where the sun never shines  
It's dark as a dungeon  
Way down in the mine

The crops are all in and the peaches are rotting  
The oranges are piled in their creosote dumps  
You're flying them back to the mexican border  
To pay all their money to wade back again  
Goodbye to my juan, goodbye rosalita  
Adios mis a-mi-gos, jesus and maria  
You won't have a name when you ride the big airplane  
All they will call you will be deportee  
  
Some of us are illegal and some of us are not wanted  
Our work contract's out and we have to move on  
But it's 600 miles to that mexican border  
They chase us like outlaws, like rustlers, like theives  
  
Goodbye to my juan, goodbye rosalita  
Adios mis a-mi-gos, jesus and maria  
You won't have a name when you ride the big airplane  
All they will call you will be deportee  
  
My father's own father, waded that river  
They took all the money he made in his life  
My brothers and sister come work the fruit trees  
They rode the truck til' they took down and died  
  
The airplane caught fire over los gatos canyon  
A fireball of lightning that shook all our hills  
Who are these dear friends all scattered like dry leaves  
The radio said they were just deportees  
  
Goodbye to my juan, goodbye rosalita  
Adios mis a-mi-gos, jesus and maria  
You won't have a name when you ride the big airplane  
All they will call you will be deportee  
  
No, all they will call you will be deportee  
All they will call you will be deportee

Last night I went to sleep in Detroit City  
And I dreamed about the cotton fields and home  
I dreamed about my mother, dear old papa, sister and brother  
And I dreamed about the girl who's been waiting for long.  
  
I want to go home, I want to go home  
Oh, how I want to go home.  
  
Home folks think I'm big in Detroit City  
From the letters that I write they think I'm fine  
But by day I make the cars, by night I ake the bars  
If only they could read between the lines.  
  
I want to go home, I want to go home  
Oh, how I want to go home.  
  
Cause you know I rode a freight train north to Detroit City  
And after all these years I find I've just been wasting my time  
So I think I'll take my foolish pride  
And put it on the south-bound freight and ride  
And go on back to the loved ones  
The ones that I left waiting so far behind.  
  
I want to go hoe, I want to go home  
Oh, how I want to go home.

(Dolly Parton)  
It's a dirty job  
But somebody's got to do it  
Better get to it  
Somebody's gotta do it  
Whatever it takes, whatever it takes  
Any work at all  
Is better than none  
Better buckle down to it  
Gotta get the job done  
Gotta earn my pay... I gotta earn my pay  
I can't wait around on the lottery  
And there ain't no millionaires  
Lookin' for me  
And somebody's gotta do it, do it  
Somebody's gotta do it, do it  
Somebody's gotta do it, do it  
Somebody  
I can think of better things  
I'd rather do  
I might get lucky  
And I'm hopin' to  
But until I do  
I gotta compromise  
The job ain't much  
But at least it's mine  
It beats standin'  
In the unemployment line  
Put pride aside  
And I'll improvise  
Even if I do get a better job  
Somebody else  
Has gotta fill my spot  
Somebody's gotta do it, do it  
Somebody's gotta do it, do it  
Somebody's gotta do it, do it  
Somebody  
Somebody  
Somebody's gotta do it, do it  
Somebody's gotta do it, do it  
It's a dirty job  
It's a low-down dirty job  
Somebody  
Even if the rules are too hard to follow  
Even when pride is too hard to swallow  
It's another day so it's another dollar  
That's what it's all about, Oh  
It's a dirty job  
But somebody's got to do it  
Better get to it  
Somebody's gotta do it  
Whatever it takes  
Gotta keep the faith  
Any work at all  
Is better than none  
Better buckle down to it  
Gotta get the job done  
Gotta earn my way  
And it's a workin' day  
The job ain't much  
But at least it's mine  
It beats standin'  
In the unemployment line  
Somebody's gotta do it, do it  
Somebody's gotta do it, do it  
Somebody's gotta do it, do it  
Somebody  
Somebody  
It's a dirty job  
Somebody's gotta do this low-down dirty job  
Somebody  
It's a dirty job, it's a dirty job  
It's a low-down dirty job  
Somebody  
Somebody  
Somebody  

Am I to face these lonely halls alone  
And when you leave, who's gonna walk me home  
Cause when you walk out the door I won't see you no more  
And you're the one I adore so baby  
Chorus:  
Don't drop out of my life, baby, don't be a fool  
(Don't drop out, baby, don't drop out now)  
You're old enough to know you're too young to face the world so cruel  
(Don't drop out, baby, don't drop out now)  
You're not prepared to do anything  
So if you wanna buy me that diamond ring, well  
Don't drop out of my life, baby, don't drop out  
My parents say you're lazy but you can be smart if you try  
And I know you've got a heart cause you've never ever made me cry  
They say you're no good so baby do what you should  
And stay here by my side oh darlin'  
Repeat Chorus  
(Don't drop out, baby, don't drop out now)  
Don't drop out of my life  
Baby, don't drop out  
(Don't drop out, baby, don't drop out now)  

(Dolly Parton)  
Our love affair is bitter sweet  
Insecure and incomplete  
And I've often wondered why your leaving's been so long delayed  
It's all become so complicated  
Maybe you feel obligated  
And out of simpathy for me you stay  
But I had rather live alone  
Than live with someone who doesn't love me  
And I'd rather have you go than stay  
And put me down a thinkin' you're above me  
Our love affair is so wound up  
It's best that we unwind  
And if you don't love me, leave me  
And don't let it trouble your mind  
You've waited much too long to leave afraid of how I'd take it  
And I'm deeply touched by your concern but I think I can make it  
It won't be easy for a while but I'll forget in time  
And if you don't love me, leave me and don't let it trouble your mind  
I had rather live alone  
Than live with someone who doesn't love me  
And I'd rather have you go than stay  
And put me down a-thinkin' you're above me  
Our love affair is so wound up  
It's best that we unwind  
And if you don't love me, leave me  
And don't let it trouble your mind  

I'm tempted, my darlin' to steal you away  
Don't let me cross over, stay out of my way  
'Cause you know that I love you and I'm not the stealin' kind  
But I'm faced with heartache here at love's cheating line  
Don't let me cross over love's cheating line  
You belong to another and can never be mine  
I know one step closer would be heaven divine  
Don't let me cross over love's cheating line  
I've tried to forget you but what else can I do  
When your eyes keep saying that you want me too  
And I know if I lose you not a dream will I have left  
I don't want to cheat, dear but I can't help myself  
Don't let me cross over love's cheating line  
You belong to another and can never be mine  
I know one step closer would be heaven divine  
Don't let me cross over love's cheating line  
Don't let me cross over love's cheating line  

Ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe  
It don't matter anyhow  
Ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe  
If you don't know by now  
  
When your roof's too close at the break of dawn  
Look out your window and I'll be gone  
You are the reason I'm traveling home  
Don't think twice, it's alright  
  
Ain't no use in turning on your light, babe  
That night, I never know  
Ain't no use in turning on your light, babe  
I'm on the dark side of the road  
  
Still I wish there was something you would do or say  
To try and make me change my mind and stay  
We never did too much talking anyway  
Don't think twice, it's alright  
  
But there ain't no use in calling out my name, babe  
Like you never did before  
And there ain't no use in calling out my name  
Cause I can't hear you anymore  
  
Well, I'm thinking and wondering while I'm way down on the road  
I once loved a man but that love grew old  
I gave him my heart, but he wanted my soul  
Don't think twice, it's alright  
  
Walking down that lone lonesome road, babe  
Where I'm bound I can't tell  
But goodbye is too good away, babe  
So I'm gonna say farewell  
  
But I ain't saying you treated me unkind  
You could have loved me better, but no, I don't mind  
But you just kinda wasted my precious time  
Don't think twice, it's alright

(Dolly Parton)  
Spent all my money on everyone else  
Why I just kept handing it out right and left  
They didn't appreciate none of my help  
I have found  
Had me a man  
I was so much in love  
But he just walked off after using me up  
I cried like a baby  
It hurt me so much and I'm down  
Yeah, I'm sure down  
I know that I'm down but I'm gonna get up  
I just need some time  
Just need a little streak of good luck  
And you know that it's rough when your bitting the dust like I am  
You try to do right but tell me where does that get you  
People just use you and then they forget you  
Well it won't take me long  
To get my feet back on solid ground  
But now I'm down  
When I get my life back in order again  
Well I'll still be willing to help out my friends  
And if you need some body or wished it had been, look around  
I'll be spending my money on everyone else  
Well I'll just be handing it out right and left  
I'll find a new love I won't live by myself  
I'm just down, now, yeah I'm down  
I know that I'm down but I'm gonna get up  
I just need some time  
Just need a little streak of good luck  
And you know that it's rough when your bitting the dust like I am  
You try to do right but tell me where does that get you  
People just use you and then they forget you  
Well it won't take me long  
To get my feet back on solid ground  
But now I'm down  
I know that I'm down  
But I'm bound to get up  

(Dolly Parton)  
I know this dress I'm wearing doesn't hide the secret I've tried concealing  
When he left he promised me he'd be back by the time it was revealing  
The sun behind a cloud just casts the crawling shadow o'er the fields of
clover  
And time is running out for me, I wish that he would hurry down from Dover  
He's been gone so long, when he left the snow was deep upon the ground  
And I have seen a spring and summer pass and now the leaves are turning brown  
At any time a tiny face will show itself 'cause waiting's almost over  
But I won't have a name to give it if he doesn't hurry down from Dover, from
Dover, from Dover  
My folks weren't understanding, when they found out they sent me from the home
place  
My daddy said if folks found out he'd be ashamed to ever show his face  
My mamma said I was a fool, she did not believe it when I told her  
Momma, everything's gonna be all right 'cause soon he would be coming down
from Dover  
I found a place to stay out on a farm takin' care of that old lady  
She never asked me nuthin' so I never talked to her about my baby  
I sent a messgae to my mom with a name and address of Ms. ol' Grover  
And to make sure he got that information when he came down from Dover  
I loved him more than anything and I could not refuse him when he needed me  
He was the only one I'd loved and I just can't believe that he was usin' me  
He wouldn't leave me here like this, I know it can't be so, it can't be over  
He wouldn't make me go through this alone, he'll be coming down from Dover  
My body aches the time is here it's lonely in this place where I'm lying  
Our baby has been born, but something's wrong, it's too still, I hear no
crying  
I guess in some strange way she knew she'd never have a father's arms to hold
her  
So dying was her way of tellin' me he wasn't coming down from Dover, from
Dover, from Dover  
Down from Dover  

When you're alone and life is making you lonely  
You can always go downtown  
When you got worries, all the noise and the hurry  
Seems to help, I know, downtown  
  
Just listen to the music of the traffic in the city  
Linger on the sidewalks where the neon signs are pretty  
How can you lose?  
The lights are much brighter there  
You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares  
  
And go downtown  
Things'll be great when you're downtown  
No finer place for sure, downtown  
Everything's waiting for you  
  
Don't hang around and let your problems surround you  
There are movie shows, downtown  
Or maybe you know some little places to go to  
Where they never close, downtown  
  
Just listen to the rhythm of the music that they're playin'  
Making conversation while you're on the dance floor swayin'  
Happy again  
The lights are much brighter there  
You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares  
  
And go downtown  
Where all the lights are bright, downtown  
Waiting for you tonight, downtown  
You're gonna be alright now  
  
And you may find somebody kind to help and understand you  
Someone who is just like you and needs a gentle hand to guide them along  
So maybe I'll see you there  
You can forget all your troubles  
Just forget all your cares  
  
And go downtown  
Things'll be great when you're downtown  
Don't wait a minute more, downtown  
Everything's waiting for you  
  
Downtown, where all the lights are bright  
Downtown, waiting for you tonight  
Downtown, you're going to be alright now  
Get on, get on, get on downtown  
  
Downtown, where all the lights are bright  
Downtown, waiting for you tonight  
Downtown, you're going to be alright now  
Get on, get on, get on downtown

(Bill Owens)  
Like the morning sun  
His love moved across every inch of my body  
And the heat from the fire burned me up with desire  
I thought I'd died and gone to heaven for sure  
This morning when I opened my eyes  
There to my surprise  
Lay that angel I thought had been only a dream  
And so I said a little prayer  
And thanked God, that he was there  
Oh, this is a dream come true  
Dream do come true  
I know 'cause I found you  
I never thought they did  
But now I do  
Dreams do come true  
It was love at first sight  
And it was love all night  
And the way he made love to me  
Fulfilled all my fantasies  
Ooo, this is a dream come true  
Yes, dreams do come true  
I know 'cause I found you  
I never thought they did  
But you're living proof  
That dreams do come true  
Dreams do come true  
And I am so in love with you  

Oh, you drive me crazy.  
I can't stop the way I feel.  
Things you do don't seem real.  
Tell you what I got in mind  
'Cause we're runnin' out of time.  
Just turn loose and let it be,  
This waitin' 'round is killin' me.  
You drive me crazy like no one else.  
You drive me crazy and I can't help myself.  
  
I can't get any rest. People say that I'm obsessed.  
You're everything I want in life, but to me that's no surprise.  
And what I have I'll give to you.  
I hope you feel the same way, too.  
  
'Cause you drive me crazy  
Like no one else.  
You drive me crazy and I can't help myself.  
  
I won't make it on my own.  
No one likes to be alone.  
You drive me crazy, yes it's true.  
I'd give it all up just to be with you.  
  
'Cause you drive me crazy like no one else.  
Oh, you drive me crazy and I can't help myself, I can't help myself.  
Oh, you drive me crazy like no one else.  
You drive me crazy and I can't help myself.  
  
Oh, you drive me crazy like no one else.  
Oh, you drive me crazy and I can't help myself.  
Oh, you drive me crazy like nobody else.  
You drive me crazy, can't help myself.  
  
I'm gonna hold you all night long.  
And I'm gonna love you 'til the cows come home.  
Drive me crazy like a rock in my shoe.  
I can't keep my mind off-a you.  
Drive me crazy and that's a fact,  
You're the one that's a makin' me feel like that.  
  
You drive me crazy, you drive me crazy, I'm a lunatic.  
I'd do anything for your sweet kiss.  
Drive me crazy, can't help myself.  
Drive me crazy like nobody else.  
You drive me crazy, oh you drive me crazy.

Don't try to cry your way out of this  
Don't try to lie or I'll catch you in it  
Don't try to make me feel sorry for you  
Just because I'm blond  
Don't think I'm dumb  
Cause this dumb blond ain't nobody's fool  
  
When you left you thought I'd sit  
An' you thought I'd wait  
An' you thought I'd cry  
You called me a dumb blond  
Ah, but somehow I lived through it  
And you know if there's one thing this blond has learned  
Blonds have more fun  
  
You flew too high up off the ground  
It's stormy weather an' had to come back down  
But I've found a new thread for my old spool  
Just because I'm blond  
Don't think I'm dumb  
Cause this dumb blond ain't nobody's fool  
  
When you left you thought I'd sit  
An' you thought I'd wait  
An' you thought I'd cry  
You called me a dumb blond  
Ah, but somehow I lived through it  
And you know if there's one thing this blond has learned  
Blonds have more fun  
  
You flew too high up off the ground  
It's stormy weather an' had to come back down  
But I've found a new thread for my old spool  
Just because I'm blond  
Don't think I'm dumb  
Cause this dumb blond ain't nobody's fool

(Dolly Parton)  
I cry awake at night and hug my pillow  
And pray that I will die before I wake  
No such luck  
Another day of cryin'  
Don't know how much more my old heart can break  
Flooded with these memories and emotions  
The tears like rain keep on falling down  
They say that I'll forget  
But my face is just as wet  
As it was the day you left this town  
Drowning in this endless, endless  
Drowning in an endless stream of tears  
It's relentless and I'm defenseless  
Drowning in an endless stream of tears  
I can't believe that I can talk about it  
I never thought I'd live to see this day  
But a broken heart won't kill you  
You just want to die  
But you have to go on livin' anyway  
I feel it through and through  
And I've never been so blue  
And I cried a river over you  
Drowning in this endless, endless  
Drowning in an endless stream of tears  
It's relentless and I'm defenseless  
Drowning in an endless stream of tears  
Oh, I'm drowning in this endless, endless  
Drowning in this endless, endless  
Drowning in this endless, endless  
Drowning in this endless stream of tears  

It's funny how love goes  
'Cause I know this could never work out  
But honey, how love grows  
Even though there's no reason to doubt  
This can never be  
You keep saying it's wrong  
Neither one of us is free  
Still I want to hold on  
  
When even a fool would let go  
'Cause he knows that there's no use in trying  
Even a child would say no  
When he knows that he'll end up crying  
Tell me now, is it wise holdin' you  
Even a fool would let go  
  
Love has no reason  
Like the words in a song that don't rhyme  
My love has no season  
I just know that it's there all the time  
Maybe just you and me  
I can't believe that it's wrong  
Thinking about you and me  
Just makes me want to hold on  
  
When even a fool would let go  
'Cause he knows that there's no use in trying  
Even a child would say no  
When he knows that he'll end up crying  
Tell me now, is it wise holdin' you  
Even a fool would let go  
  
Tell me now, is it wise holdin' you  
When even a fool would let go

(Dolly Parton)  
My train of thought was broken by a sudden burst of laughter  
Something badly needed to brighten up the chores  
Seemed old Mrs. Bailey had accidentally fell  
In the water being used to scrub the floors  
Now Mrs. Bailey was the meanest matron at the home  
She believed in lots of work with little play  
And we laughed till we bent double  
Though we knew we'd get in trouble  
But trouble's all we had at evening shade  
Now evening shade was where they claim to teach you understanding  
To teach you love and keep you off the streets  
And all the kids that live here are said to be a problem  
Juvenile delinquents so to speak  
But understanding isn't learned from punishment and anger  
An iron has no gentle touch and love ain't learned from hate  
The reason we were here is 'cause we had no one who cared  
But they cared even less at evening shade  
Little Susan Bradley, one night had wet her bed  
Mrs. Bailey took the razor strap and beat her half to death  
And I knew that something must be done to put an end to this  
And so I started talking plans with the older kids  
Plans were that Joe Johnson would steal the kerosene  
And I would get some matches when nobody seen  
Beckie Adams would make sure the kids were all outside  
Billy Watson would look out for the evil eye  
Now Mrs. Bailey took a nap at three o'clock each day  
We knew that she'd be a'sleeping as the plans got underway  
Now that its all over and the sun is going down  
There's no evening shade 'cause we burned it to the ground  

Something in your eyes makes me want to lose myself  
Makes me want to lose myself in your arms  
There's something in your voice makes my heart beat fast  
Hope this feeling lasts the rest of my life  
If you knew how lonely my life has been  
And how long I've felt so low  
If you knew how I wanted someone to come along  
And change my life the way you've done  
Feels like home to me  
Feels like home to me  
Feels like I'm all the way back where I come from  
Feels like home to me  
Feels like home to me  
Feels like I'm all the way back where I belong  
A window breaks down a long dark street  
And a siren wails in the night  
But I'm alright cause I have you here with me  
And I can almost see through the dark there's light  
If you knew how much this moment means to me  
And how long I've waited for your touch  
If you know how happy you are making me  
I've never thought I'd love anyone so much  
Feels like home to me  
Feels like home to me  
Feels like I'm all the way back where I come from  
Feels like home to me  
Feels like home to me  
Feels like I'm all the way back where I belong  
Feels like I'm all the way back where I belong

Familiar sounds tell me it's morning the night has been so dark and long  
Each night without you just gets longer  
While this torch I still carry just burns stronger  
I know I never will stop loving you my tears just can't put out the flame  
Or drown my hopes of your returning cause baby the fire's still burning  
  
[Steel]  
  
Wherever you are I hope you're happy although your love for me has died  
But if you ever need or want me I'll take you back any time  
I know I never will stop...  
Yes baby the fire's still burning

(Dolly Parton)  
I feel so out of place here  
With this high society  
These high fallutin' people  
Don't know what to make of me  
I feel like a minnow in a sea of Moby Dicks  
A small fry in a big pan  
They're caviar -- I'm fish sticks  
Fish out of water  
I know I don't belong  
Fish out of water  
Everything I do is wrong  
My style of hair, the clothes I wear  
The way I speak, the things I eat  
The way I act, my lack of tact  
Nothin' seems to fit  
Fish out of water  
Flounderin' round  
Out of my element  
But I'm just as good as they are  
Why do I feel second rate  
It's like, "Sorry Charlie,  
We want only tuna with good taste"  
I guess you could say Wal-Mart  
Is quite a way from Gucci's  
I'm Timex, they're Rolex  
I'm Captain D's, they're sushi  
Fish out of water  
I've had it to the gills  
Fish out of water  
With these yuppie-guppie frills  
Yeah, I'm a square in a round hole  
A catfish in a goldfish bowl  
A little fish with lots of soul  
Out of my element  
Fish out of water  
Flounderin' round just for the Halibut  
Save me, save me  
S.O.S. somebody  
Save me, save me  
Somebody rescue me  
Fish out of water  
Somebody throw me in  
Fish out of water  
On a scale of one to ten  
I'm a two, perhaps a three  
Compared to the big fish in the sea  
I'm washed ashore so save me please  
I'm in an awful fix  
Fish out of water  
Rescue me  
And you better do it quick  
Fish out of water  
It's such a culture shock  
Fish out of water  
My stomach's tied in knots  
Fish out of water  
Fish out of water  

Don't tell me you're sorry for thing you caused me  
And from from now on you'll be true  
And don't don't you ask me to forgive you again I'm fresh out of forgiveness
for you  
  
Now I, I gave you everything I knew how to give  
Now I've done done everything you've ever asked me to do  
But even even a fool gets so tired being fool I'm fresh out of forgiveness for
you  
  
No I I can't I just can't I can't forgive you this time if I did oh I know you
do  
Well you're just too just too wrong and you hurt me hurt me again  
And I'm fresh out of forgiveness for you I'm fresh out of forgiveness for you

I could hold out my arms, say "I love you this much"  
I could tell you how long I will long for your touch  
How much and how far would I go to prove  
The depth and the breadth of my love for you?  
From here to the moon and back  
Who else in this world will love you like that?  
Love everlasting, I promise you that  
From here to the moon and back  
From here to the moon and back  
  
I want you to know you can always depend  
On promises made and love without end  
No need to wonder how faithful I'll be  
Now and on into eternity  
  
From here to the moon and back  
Who else in this world will love you like that?  
Forever and always, I'll be where you're at  
From here to the moon and back  
From here to the moon and back  
  
I would blow you a kiss from the star where I sat  
I would call out your name to echo through the vast  
Thank heaven for you and to God, tip my hat  
From here to the moon and back  
And I'll spend forever just proving that fact  
From here to the moon and back

You've seen me naked in more ways than one  
You've seen me done up, seen me come undone  
We've cried in the darkness, we've laughed in the sun  
We've been forever, yet we've just begun  
We've come full circle, all the way 'round  
Through the good times and bad times, through life's ups and downs  
Still we've stayed together through thick and through thin  
Yes, we've come full circle, thank God, we're still friends  
And you know the soft spots under my skin  
Deep down inside me, where no one has been  
We've sailed troubled waters, we've soared on the wind  
But time's only sweetened this love that we're in  
And we've come full circle, all the way 'round  
Through the good times and bad times, through life's ups and downs  
Still we've stayed together through thick and through thin  
Yes, we've come full circle, thank God, we're still friends  
We've cried in the darkness, laughed in the sun  
We've come full circle and we've just begun  
We've come full circle, we've been all the way 'round  
(We've come full circle)  
We've come full circle, we've been all the way 'round  
You know we've cried in the darkness and we've laughed in the sun  
(We've come full circle, we've been all the way 'round)  
But we've stayed together and we've just begun  
(We've come full circle, we've been all the way 'round)  
I'm so glad you're still my friend  
(We've come full circle, we've been all the way 'round)  
We've come full circle  

(Joe South)  
Oh the games people play now  
Every night and every day now  
Never meaning what they say now  
Never saying what they mean  
Oh they whine away the hours  
In their ivory towers  
Til they're covered up with flowers  
In the back of a black limousine  
  
La la la mmm da da da  
La la la mmm da da dee  
I'm talkin' 'bout you and me  
And the games people play  
  
Oh they make one another cry  
Break their hearts and they say good-bye  
Cross their heart and they hope to die  
That the other was to blame  
Neither one will ever give in  
So they gaze at an eight by ten  
Thinkin' 'bout the way it might have been  
And it's a dirty rotten shame  
  
La la la mmm da da da  
La la la mmm da da dee  
I'm talkin' 'bout you and me  
And the games people play  
  
Oh they teach how to meditate  
Read your horoscope and teach you faith  
The furthermore the hell with hate  
Come on and get on board  
Look around and tell me what you see  
What's a-happenin' to you and to me  
God grant me the serenity  
To just remember who I am  
  
La la la mmm da da da  
La la la mmm da da dee  
I'm talkin' 'bout you and me  
And the games people play

Gee, Ma, I wanna go, but they won't let me go  
Gee, Ma, I wanna go home  
Oh, the soldiers in the army, we know they're mighty fine  
And the Navy, Air Force and Marines keep us all in line  
But I don't want no more of this military life  
Gee, Ma, I wanna go, but they won't let me go  
Gee, Ma, I wanna go home  
Oh, the viddles in the mess hall, they say they're mighty fine  
But that She-Ite on a shingle, why, I think I'll give you mine  
Oh, I don't want no more of this military life  
Gee, Ma, I wanna go, but they won't let me go  
Gee, Ma, I wanna go home  
  
Oh, I wanna go back home, back where civilians roam  
Gee, Ma, I wanna go home  
  
Well, now, I tried to join the army, they said my feet were flat  
And since I can not see them, I'll take their word for that  
Oh Gee, Ma, I wanna go home  
  
Oh, I wanna go back home, back where civilians roam  
Gee, Ma, I wanna go home  
  
Oh, the mother of all battles is what Sadam had planned  
Well, he shoulda sent his Mother 'cause his troops all turned and ran  
Oh, I don't want no more of this military life  
Gee, Ma, I wanna go, but they won't let me go  
Gee, Ma, I wanna go home  
  
Oh, I wanna go back home, back where civilians roam  
Where my rules are all my own  
Gee, Ma, I wanna go home

If tomorrow all the things were gone  
I'd worked for all my life  
And I had to start again  
With just my children and my wife  
  
I'd thank my lucky stars  
To be living here today  
Cause the flag still stands for freedom  
And they can't take that away  
  
And I'm proud to be an American  
Where at least I know I'm free  
And I won't forget the men who died  
Who gave that right to me  
  
And I gladly stand up next to you  
And defend her still today  
Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land  
God Bless the U.S.A.  
  
From the lakes of Minnesota  
To the hills of Tennessee  
Across the plains of Texas  
From sea to shining sea  
  
From Detroit down to Houston  
And New York to L.A.  
Well there's pride in every American heart  
And it's time we stand and say  
  
That I'm proud to be an American  
Where at least I know I'm free  
And I won't forget the men who died  
Who gave that right to me  
  
And I gladly stand up next to you  
And defend her still today  
Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land  
God Bless the U.S.A.  
  
And I'm proud to be an American  
Where at least I know I'm free  
And I won't forget the men who died  
Who gave that right to me  
  
And I gladly stand up next to you  
And defend her still today  
Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land  
God Bless the U.S.A.

Today as I was walking  
In the fields just down the way  
I sat down on a fallen log  
To pass the time away  
And as I looked around me  
The more that I did look  
The more I realize that I am viewing  
God's coloring book  
I saw a golden ray of sunlight  
A silver drop of dew  
A soft, white floating cloud  
Sailing cross the sky 'a blue  
A yellow dandelion  
Pretty evergreen  
And some red and orange flowers  
Growing wild along the stream  
And the more I look around me  
And the more that I do look  
The more I realize that I am viewing  
God's coloring book  
The greyness in an old man's hair  
The pink in baby's cheeks  
The blackness in a stormy sky  
The brown in fallen leaves  
And the multicolored rainbow  
Stretched out across the sky  
And the purple haze at sunset  
Just before the night  
And the more I look around me  
And the more that I do look  
The more I realize that I am viewing  
God's coloring book  
Then I turn my face toward the sky  
And say a silent prayer  
Though God doesn't speak to me  
I see him everywhere  
He is all around me  
He's everywhere I look  
And each new day is but a new page  
In god's coloring book  
Tag:  
Each new day is but a new page  
In god's coloring book  
Hmmmmmm  

You shake my nerves and you rattle my brain  
Too much love can drive a girl insane  
You broke my will oh but what a thrill  
Goodness gracious great balls of fire  
I like that love cause i thought it was funny

I change my mind this love is sure fine

[Chorus]  
Ooh kiss me baby, ooh it feels good  
Ooh hold me, hold me, i would love to love you

You broke my will but i love you still and  
Goodness gracious great balls of fire

Goodness gracious great balls of fire  
You broke my will but i love you still  
Goodness gracious great balls of fire  
  
Goodness gracious great balls of fire

(Dolly Parton)  
I flew off to the wild blue yonder  
'Cause I had a dream  
And I had to go  
But I'm filled with a sense of wonder  
From the love I shared  
With a green-eyed boy  
Lips as sweet as mountain honey  
A body warm as home made wine  
But he had no dreams  
And no means for money  
But he had me just anytime  
Take me back, If just in memory  
Fill my cup again with joy  
The fire still burns in the old rock chimney  
And I still burn for that green-eyed boy  
Now he was pretty  
With chiseled features  
Like the movie stars in the magazines  
My first love and the son of a preacher  
I fantasized me was James Dean  
But the world outside kept pulling at me  
Offered me fame, respect, and gold  
Designer clothes and a fancy mansion  
Expensive cars, so I chose those  
Take me back, If just in memory  
Fill my cup again with joy  
The fire still burns in the old rock chimney  
And I still burn for that green-eyed boy  
Take me back, If just in memory  
Fill my cup again with joy  
The fire still burns in the old rock chimney  
And I still burn for that green-eyed boy  
Ooh, ooh, how I love that green-eyed boy  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, and I still miss  
That green-eyed boy  
Do you think about me  
When the nights are long and cold  
Do you ever miss me  
Do you my green-eyed boy  

(Dolly Parton)  
We might have slept in a rail yard or camped by the river bank  
We fed ourselves from the fruit of the land  
And quenched our thirst with rain  
We never did allow no roots to grow beneath our feet  
Life just had no pattern for Gypsy Joe and me  
All we had was each other and the rags upon our back  
The closest thing to a home we new was some abandoned shack  
But we had all we needed and the rest we didn't need  
Life was free and simple for Gypsy Joe and me  
Now Gypsy was my little dog, I found by the road in a ditch  
And so I named him Gypsy, cause that name just seemed to fit  
Oh and Joe he was my man, the flower of my soul  
Thou he never said he loved me, I just always seemed to know  
While standing by the highway, thumbin' for a ride  
The speeding wheels of a passing car, took Gypsy's life  
I lost him where I found him and his loss was misery  
Now there's no more Gypsy, there's just Joe and me  
Well the winter came and the snow did fall  
And the night was cold and still  
And the rags we wore were not enough  
And Joe he caught the chill  
And he told me how he loved me  
And in my arms he went to sleep  
Now there's no more Gypsy, no more Joe, there's just me  
While standin' here on the edge of this bridge  
Lookin' down I see  
The face of Joe and Gypsy, lookin' back at me  
And somewhere in the distance I can hear them callin' me  
Tonight we'll be together again  
Gypsy, Joe and me  

Hello, God?  
Are You out there?  
Can You hear me?  
Are You listenin' anymore?  
Hello, God?  
If we're still on speakin' terms  
Can You help me like before?  
I have questioned Your existence  
My resistance leaves me cold  
Can you help me go the distance?  
Hello God?  
Hello?  
Hello?  
  
This old world has gone to pieces  
Can we fix it?  
Is there time?  
Hate and violence just increases  
We're so selfish, cruel, and blind  
We fight and kill each other  
In Your name defending You  
Do You love some more than others?  
We're so lost and confused  
  
Hello, God?  
Are you out there?  
Can you hear us?  
Are you listenin' anymore?  
Hello, God?  
If we're still on speakin' terms  
Can You help us like before?  
Oh, the free will You have given  
We have made a mockery of  
This is no way to be livin'  
We're in great need of Your love  
Hello, God?  
  
(Hello hello)  
Hello, God?  
Can You grant us  
Love enough to make amends?  
(Hello, God)  
Is there still a chance  
That we could start again?  
Hello, God?  
We've learned our lesson  
Dear God, don't let us go  
(Hello, hello)  
More than ever  
Hello God?  
Hello?  
Hello?  
Hello, God?  
We really need You  
We can't make it without You  
(Hello, God)  
We beseech You  
In the name of all that's true  
Hello, God?  
Please forgive us  
For we know not what we do  
Hello, God?  
Give us one more chance  
To prove ourselves to You  
Hello, God?  
Hello, God?

Help, I need somebody  
Help, not just anybody  
Help, I need somebody  
Please, please help me  
When I was younger, so much younger than today  
I never needed anybody's help in anyway  
But now those days are gone and I'm not so self assured  
No I finally changed my mind and I opened up the door  
  
Help me, if you can I'm feelin' down  
And I do appreciate you being 'round  
Won't you help me get my feet back on the ground  
Won't you please, please help me  
  
And now my life has changed in so many ways  
My independence seemed to vanish in the haze  
But every now and then I feel so insecure  
I know that I need your light, I never done before  
  
Help me, if you can I'm feelin' down  
And I do appreciate you being 'round  
Won't you help me get my feet back on the ground  
Won't you please, please help me  
  
Help me, help me, ooh  
  
When I was younger, so much younger than today  
I never needed anybody's help in anyway  
But now those days are gone and I'm not so self assured  
No I finally changed my mind and I opened up the door  
  
Help me, if you can I'm feelin' down  
And I do appreciate you being 'round  
Won't you help me get my feet back on the ground  
Won't you please, please help me  
  
Help me, if you can I'm feelin' down  
And I do appreciate you being 'round  
Won't you help me get my feet back on the ground  
Won't you please, please help me  
  
Help me, help me, ooh

(Dolly Parton)  
Here I am, oh here I am, here I am  
If you need a love that's true  
Need someone to stand by you  
Here I am, oh here I am, here I am  
If you need a helping hand, need someone to understand  
Here I am, oh here I am, here I am  
Here I am, I'm reaching out to give you love that you're without  
I can help you find what you've been looking for  
Here I am, come to me, take my hand 'cause I believe  
I can give you all the love you need and more  
Oh here I am, oh here I am, here I am  
My world is such an empty place  
I need someone to fill the space  
And here I am, oh here I am, here I am  
'Cause I've got so much love to give  
I need someone to share it with  
And here I am, oh here I am, here I am  
Here I am, I'm reaching out to give you love that you're without  
I can help you find what you've been searching for  
Here I am, come to me, take my hand 'cause I believe  
I can give you all the love you need and more  
Oh here I am, oh here I am, here I am  
Oh here I am, oh here I am, here I am  
Here I am, oh here I am, here I am  

(Dolly Parton)  
He's a go getter, go getter  
When his wife gets off from work, he'll go get her  
Now I've got a neighbor that lives down the road a ways  
His wife holds down a steady job, he don't turn his hand all day  
I know that most of you will know the kind I'm talkin' about  
The kind that rather than have to work, he'd rather do without  
But he's a go getter, a go getter  
When his wife gets off from work, he'll go get her  
There's a group of men in the court house yard any time that you go by  
Playin' checkers and tradin' odds and makin' jokes about their wives  
They wait all week for pay day and they hold the money's plenty  
And the wife that's worked those long hard hours never gets a penny  
But he's a go getter, a go getter  
When his wife gets off from work, he'll go get her  
Yes he's a go getter, a go getter  
When his wife gets off from work, he'll go get her  
He's a go getter, a go getter  
When his wife gets off from work, he'll go get her  

The gates and doors were barred  
And all the windows fastened down  
I spent the night in sleeplessness  
And rose at every sound  
Half in hope of sorrow  
And half in fear the day  
Would find the soldiers breakin' through  
To drag us all away  
And just before the sunrise  
I heard something at the wall  
The gate began to rattle  
And a voice began to call  
I hurried to the window  
Looked down into the street  
Expecting swords and torches  
And the sound of soldiers' feet  
  
But there was no one there but Mary  
So I went down to let her in  
John stood there beside me  
As she told me where she'd been  
She said they've moved Him in the night  
And none of us know where  
The stone's been rolled away  
And now His body isn't there  
  
We both ran towards the garden  
Then John ran on ahead  
We found the stone and empty tomb  
Just the way that Mary said  
But the winding sheet they wrapped Him in  
Was just an empty shell  
And how or where they'd taken Him  
Was more than I could tell  
  
Oh something strange had happened there  
Just what I did not know  
John believed a miracle  
But I just turned to go  
Circumstance and speculation  
Couldn't lift me very high  
'Cause I'd seen them crucify Him  
Then I saw Him die  
  
Back inside the house again  
The guilt and anguish came  
Everything I'd promised Him  
Just added to my shame  
When at last it came to choices  
I denied I knew His name  
And even if He was alive  
It wouldn't be the same  
  
But suddenly the air was filled  
With a strange and sweet perfume  
Light that came from everywhere  
Drove shadows from the room  
And Jesus stood before me  
With His arms held open wide  
And I fell down on my knees  
And I just clung to Him and cried  
  
Then He raised me to my feet  
And as I looked into His eyes  
The love was shining out from Him  
Like sunlight from the skies  
Guilt in my confusion  
Disappeared in sweet release  
And every fear I ever had  
Just melted into peace  
  
He's alive yes He's alive  
Yes He's alive and I'm forgiven  
Heaven's gates are open wide  
He's alive yes He's alive  
Oh He's alive and I'm forgiven  
Heaven's gates are open wide  
He's alive He's alive  
Hallelujah He's alive  
He's alive and I'm forgiven  
Heaven's gates are open wide  
He's alive He's alive He's alive  
I believe it He's alive  
Sweet Jesus

Lucky lady, lucky lady, I was once the lucky lady  
I was happy with my baby, I was such a lucky lady  
Hey, lucky lady, lucky lady, you are now the lucky lady  
Are you happy with my baby, you know you're a lucky lady, you lucky lady  
Lucky lady, that's what I was, I was lucky to have his love  
All a woman could wish for, he was that and so much more  
He was mine and how I loved him before your hands ever touched him  
Long before your temping eyes lured my baby from my life  
Hey, hey, Lucky lady, lucky lady, you are now the lucky lady  
Are you happy with my baby, you know you're a lucky lady  
Lucky lady, lucky lady, I was once the lucky lady  
I was happy with my baby, you know you're a lucky lady, you lucky lady  
Is it love or is it pleasure, do you know you've found a treasure  
Are you only having fun, do you know the prize you've won?  
If you don't want something lasting, if it's just the time you're passing  
Lucky lady, give him up 'cause I do love him very much  
Lucky lady, lucky lady, I was once the lucky lady  
I was happy with my baby, I was such a lucky lady  
Hey, lucky lady, lucky lady, you are now the lucky lady  
Are you happy with my baby, you know you're a lucky lady, you lucky lady  
Hey, hey, Lucky lady, lucky lady, you are now the lucky lady  
Are you happy with my baby, you know you're a lucky lady  

He is high and mighty  
He is high and mighty  
He is there and ever waiting  
Reaching out to you and me  
  
He is high and mighty  
Oh, mighty is His power  
Mighty is His love  
He is high and mighty  
He is there with the answers  
Let us lift Him up  
  
God loves you, did you know that?  
Ain't it good to know he cares  
If you're burdened down with troubles  
Just go to Him in prayer  
Say God, I'm just a seeker  
I'm empty, scared and lost  
Then lay your burdens down  
At the foot of the cross  
  
He said ye shall know the truth  
And the truth shall set you free  
He will guide and lead you  
And fulfill every need  
Nothing is impossible  
If you have faith enough  
So if you've lost direction  
Stop and just look up  
  
'Cause He is high and mighty  
Ooh, mighty is His power, mighty is His love  
He is high and mighty  
He is life everlasting  
Let us lift Him up  
  
High and mighty  
He is high and mighty  
I believe, I do believe  
That His love has set me free  
I believe, I believe, I believe  
  
He is high and mighty  
Oh, mighty is His power, mighty is His love  
He is high and He's mighty  
It's a wonderful feeling  
Let us lift Him up  
He said if I be lifted up  
He said if I be lifted up  
What did He say?  
He said if I be lifted up  
I'll draw all the men unto me  
Let's lift him higher, higher  
Higher and higher each day  
Let's lift Him up  
'Cause He is high and He's mighty  
And He has washed my sins away  
'Cause He's high and He's mighty

I've been higher than the high sierra  
Lower than death valley must be  
I've been right, mostly wrong  
Wrong about you, right about me  
  
The way I feel can't explain  
So much passion turned to pain  
The sun still shines most of the time  
Did you know the sun shines when it rains  
  
I've been higher than the high sierra  
Lower than death valley must be  
I've been right, mostly wrong  
Wrong about you, right about me  
  
I've been cussed and I've been praised  
And I've been nothin' these days  
I'll come back, time will see  
If I'm wrong about you, right about me  
  
I've been higher than the high sierra  
Lower than death valley must be  
I've been right, mostly wrong  
Wrong about you, right about me  
  
Wrong about you, right about me  
Wrong about you, right about me

Now Little Will was from the hills way back in the sticks  
He got his reputation from turning on them country chicks  
He drove a souped up hot rod car buddy he could really  
Knock those little girls off their feet yeah  
Hillbilly Willy  
He'd talk that ole sweet lovers talk with a hillbilly drawl  
Willy wasn't much for looks he was only five feet tall  
But when he talked that ole sweet talk he drove those little girls silly  
They stood in line waiting for their time to court  
Hillbilly Willy  
  
Then this country cyclops who measured six foot nine  
Came up to Little Will and said, "You stole that little girl of mine"  
Then there was a awful brawl boy it was a dilly  
When the fighting stopped there on top stood  
Hillbilly Willy  
  
Now the moral of the story is to be a lover you gotta be tough  
Even if you're just five feet tall you gotta be able to strut your stuff  
Now to all you lovers in radioland, if your love life's a little chilly  
Bear in mind the rough, tough kind like  
Hillbilly Willy  
  
Just bear in mind the rough, tough kind like  
Hillbilly Willy

We're holding on to nothing left to hold onto  
I'm so tired of holding on to nothin'  
The years have shown no kindness  
For the hard times we've been through  
  
We've squeezed the life from every dream  
And still go right on bluffin'  
With really nothin' left to hold onto  
  
Oh, why do we keep holding on  
With nothing left to hold onto  
Let's be honest with each other  
That's the least that we can do  
I feel guilty when they envy me and you  
We're holding on with nothing left to hold onto  
  
We were young and foolishly mistaken  
Victims of a passion, much too strong to be denied  
With only tears to show for all the years that we've been fakin'  
God only knows how long, how hard we've tried  
  
Oh, why do we keep holding on  
With nothing left to hold onto  
Let's be honest with each other  
That's the least that we can do  
I feel guilty when they envy me and you  
We're holding on with nothing left to hold onto  
  
We're holding on with nothing left to hold onto

There are those who'd love to love me  
Take me home and take care of me  
Treat me just the way you never do  
But I'm here on your door step  
Something I can't seem to help  
Like a fool, I'm holdin' on to you  
  
[Chorus:]  
Oh, you don't love me, you don't love me  
You place everything above me  
Like a fool, I'm holdin' on to you  
You don't want me, you don't want me  
  
You just hurt and disappoint me  
Like a fool, I'm holding on to, ooh, ooh  
Like a fool, I'm holding on to you  
What is this spell that's on me  
Make me think you own me  
Why do I keep holding on to you  
I just can't shake the feeling  
I only know it's real  
And I keep holding, holding, holding on to you  
  
[Chorus:]

My heart beats, wild and deep  
Every thought in my mind has your name on it  
Hard to breathe, I can't speak  
Think of your love and just how much I want it  
  
[Chorus]  
When I'm touching you, I feel a sudden change  
When I'm kissing you, I taste the sun and rain  
When I look at you, I hear the angels sing  
And when I'm holding you, I'm holding everything  
  
Everything that's mine to give  
Everything I can do, I'll do to prove it  
For as long (for as long)  
As I may live (as I may live)  
My love will be there for you to use it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Everything, I'm holding everything  
When I'm touching you, I'm touching everything  
When I'm kissing you, I'm kissing everything  
Everything (everything) uh huh  
  
My heart beats, wild and deep  
Every thought in my mind has your name on it  
It's hard to breathe (it's hard to breathe)  
And I can't speak (I can't speak)  
Think of your love and just how bad I, want it  
  
And when you're touching me, I feel a sudden change  
When you're kissing me, I taste the sun and rain  
And when I look at you, I hear the angels sing  
  
You're everything (everything)  
I'm holding everything (everything)  
Everything (you're everything)  
You're everything (everything to me)  
Everything (everything)  
You're everything

(Dolly Parton)  
Mother's hold on to your sons and you daughters  
Should Hollywood claim them, you'll hold then no more  
Cause they'll become claimed to the Hollywood potters  
And there's no escape once they walk through that door  
Hollywood, Hollywood Dungeon of Drama  
Center of sorrow, city of schemes  
Hollywood, Hollywood Terrace of Trauma  
Palace of promises, dealer in dreams  
Some, they go hungry and some go insane  
Some go to the bottle and some to the vains  
Some become users and some become used  
And some even make it, but most never do  
Hollywood, Hollywood Dungeon of Drama  
Center of sorrow, city of schemes  
Hollywood, Hollywood Terrace of Trauma  
Palace of promises, dealer in dreams  
You spin them around like a merry-go-round  
You mold them and shape them and then throw them down  
All of your glitter and all of your gold  
Is that what you give in exchange for a soul  
Cause they sell their soles for the likes of you  
While you chew up and spit out what you cannot use  
Mother's hold on to your sons and you daughters  
Should Hollywood claim them, you'll hold then no more  
Cause they'll become claimed to the Hollywood potters  
And there's no escape once they walk through that door  
Hollywood, Hollywood Dungeon of Drama  
Center of sorrow, city of schemes  
Hollywood, Hollywood Terrace of Trauma  
Palace of promises, dealer in dreams  

(Dolly Parton)  
Bartender won't you pour me a very strong drink  
Just keep it coming till I don't have to think  
And point out some cowboy that might want to dance  
And make sure I get home if you see that I can't  
You see I loved him, he left me for a girl half my age  
I relate to each sad song that ole jukebox has played  
I listen to Haggard, ole Hank, and George Jones  
But why don't more women sing honky tonk songs?  
Why don't more women sing honky-tonk songs?  
About the heartaches and the tough breaks  
And the men that's done 'em wrong  
There are others just like me that are hurtin' to the bone  
So why don't more women sing honky-tonk songs  
Why don't more women sing honky tonk songs  
Honky tonk angels are just queens without thrones  
Judge not lest you be judged, who can cast the first stone  
Why don't more women sing honky-tonk songs  
Bartender won't you pour me a very strong drink  
Just keep it coming till I don't have to think  
And point out some cowboy that might want to dance  
And make sure I get home if you see that I can't  
(All you lonely women sing)  
Why don't more women sing honky tonk songs  
About the heartaches and the tough breaks  
And all the men that's done us wrong  
There's a whole lotta women I know would sing along  
So why don't more women sing honky tonk songs  
Why don't more women sing honky tonk songs  

I know that you're out there  
Knowing that there's someone out here thinkin' of you  
In your heart and in your mind  
I know there is no doubt that someone loves you  
And I know that you know  
That I'll be waiting here when you have need of me  
And when the world has chained you down  
I know you know my love will set you free  
How does it feel to know that someone loves you  
How does it feel to know that someone's always thinkin' of you  
Oh and how does it feel to know that someone puts no one above you  
How does it feel to know that someone loves you, someone loves you  
  
I have come to know and love you  
Like I've never known or loved another  
Words have not been made  
That could describe these feelings we have for each other  
And I would go to any length  
To let you know at all times that I care  
'Cause I want you to know  
That any time you reach for me you'll find me there  
  
How does it feel to know that someone loves you  
How does it feel to know that someone's always thinkin' of you  
Oh and how does it feel to know that someone puts no one above you  
How does it feel to know that someone loves you, someone loves you  
  
Someone loves you, how does it feel to know it  
Someone loves you, how does it feel to know that someone  
Loves you, someone loves you, how does it feel, how does it feel  
How does it feel to know that someone loves you  
Somebody loves you, how does it feel, how does it feel  
How does it feel to know that someone loves you  
Someone loves you, somebody loves you  
Somebody loves you, how does it feel to know it  
Somebody loves you

Oh Lord my God when I in awesome wonder  
Consider all the worlds Thy hands have made  
Now I see the stars and I hear the rolling thunder  
Thy art throughout the universe displayed  
Then sings my soul my Saviour God to Thee  
How great Thou art oh  
How great Thou art  
Then sings my soul my Saviour God to Thee  
How great Thou art  
How great Thou art  
When Christ shall come with shouts of acclamation  
To take me home what joy shall fill my heart  
Then I shall kneel in humble adoration and there proclaim my God  
How great Thou art  
Then sings my soul

The thrill, the desire, the excitement is gone  
We seem to have found a safe comfort zone  
We worked so hard to get where we are  
That romance got lost on the way  
  
It used to be never enough  
We'd melt with each look and each burning touch  
We laughed and we loved and we just ate it up  
Back when we were hungry that way  
  
Let's love like we're hungry again  
Bring back the passion we had back then  
The time has gone by, we forgot what it meant  
Lets love like we're hungry again  
  
Don't you miss those feelings we had at the start  
And that fire that got started from each little spark  
Oh it's good where we are, but I miss where we've been  
Lets love like we're hungry again, now and then  
  
Lets love like we're hungry again  
Bring back the passion we had back then  
The time has gone by, now we've grown too content  
Lets love like we're hungry again, now and then  
Lets love like we're hungry again

(Dolly Parton)  
Many years you have lingered around my cabin door  
Oh hard times come again no more  
Oh hard times come again no more  
Oh hush a bye hard times, go ye away  
Cause my hungry baby wants a Gingerbread Cake  
Not a cow in the barn yard no money to spend  
Not an egg in the hayloft, no little red hen  
So, hush a bye baby don't cry no more  
Your mama can't give you what you're crying for  
There's a wolf at the door with an angry  
Cold hungry stare, he keeps howling of hard times  
And the cupboard is bare  
Oh, hush a bye hard times go ye to rest  
Cause my ragged baby wants a new ruffled dress  
And she wants some new shoes with buckles to wear  
And she wants some silver bows for her golden hair  
So, hush a bye baby don't cry no more  
Your mama can't give you what you're crying for  
There's a wolf at the door with an angry  
Cold hungry stare, he keeps howling of hard times  
And the cupboard is bare  
So, hush a bye baby don't cry no more  
Your mama can't give you what you're crying for  
There's a wolf at the door with an angry  
Cold hungry stare, he keeps howling of hard times  
And the cupboard is bare  
Hush a bye hard times go ye away  
I don't intend to be treated this way  
So, hush a bye baby  
Hush a bye hard times  
Hush a bye baby  
Don't cry no more  
Hush a bye hard times  
Hush a bye baby  
Hush a bye hard times  
Come ye no more  
Many years you have lingered around my cabin door  
Hush a bye hard times  
Come ye no more  
Hush a bye baby  
Hush a bye hard times  
Hush a bye baby  
Don't cry no more  
Hush a bye hard times  
Hush a bye baby  
Hush a bye hard times  
Come ye no more  

I am ready  
Oh my children  
When Jesus knocks at my door  
I'll be there come morning  
Don't weep for me  
I'll be with my Lord  
  
There's my bible on the table  
Read it to me once more  
I can hear God's heavenly angels  
Singing me on through heaven's door  
  
Hellelujah Lord  
I am ready  
No more sorrow  
Hallelujah, yes  
I am ready, I am ready  
I am ready to go  
  
Oh Hosanna  
Take my hand now  
Lead me to the promised land now  
I am ready, I am ready  
Hellelujah I am ready to go  
  
Oh Hosanna  
I am ready to go  
I can hear God's heavenly angels  
Singing me on through heaven's door  
Singing me on through heaven's door  
And I am ready

I believe for every drop of rain that falls  
A flower grows  
And I believe that somewhere in the darkest night  
A candle glows  
I believe for everyone who goes astray  
Someone will come to show the way  
Yes I believe  
Oh I believe  
I believe above the storm  
The smallest prayer will still be heard  
I believe that someone  
In the great somewhere hears every word  
Every time I hear a newborn baby cry  
Or touch a leaf or see the sky  
Then I know why I believe  
Every time I hear a newborn baby cry  
Or touch a leaf or see the sky  
Then I know why I believe  
I believe  
Oh I believe

I believe in Santa Claus  
I believe in Santa Claus  
I believe there's always hope when all seems lost  
And I believe in Santa Claus  
I believe in Santa Claus, I'll tell you why I do  
'Cause I believe that dreams and plans and wishes can come true  
I believe in miracles, I believe in magic too  
Oh I believe in Santa Claus and I believe in you  
  
I believe in family, in country and in smiles  
I believe in turnin' negatives to positives in life  
I believe in lookin' farther up the farther down we get  
I believe when someone hurts us we should forgive and forget  
  
And I believe in Santa Claus  
I believe in Santa Claus  
I believe love should prevail at any cost  
And I believe in Santa Claus  
  
I believe in saying what you mean and meaning what you say  
I believe a better attitude can make a better way  
And I believe in viewing life as a journey that we're on  
And lookin' at our troubles as another stepping stone  
  
And I believe that everything in life is what it's meant to be  
I believe there is a God somewhere although he's hard to see  
I believe I am so therefore I should do all that I can  
To be a better piece in the puzzle of God's plan  
  
And I believe in Santa Claus  
I believe in Santa Claus  
I believe there's always hope when all seems lost  
And I believe in Santa Claus  
  
Let the little children sing it  
  
I believe in Santa Claus, I believe in Santa Claus  
I believe in Santa Claus, I believe in Santa Claus  
  
Let the whole world sing it with us  
  
I believe in Santa Claus, I believe in Santa Claus  
I believe in Santa Claus, I believe in Santa Claus  
  
Let the whole world sing it with us  
  
I believe in Santa Claus  
I believe in Santa Claus  
I believe there's always hope when all seems lost  
I believe in Santa Claus

I can lose myself in the beauty of a song  
I can climb to the top of a cloud in the sky  
I can soar through the heavens like a graceful eagle  
I can swing from the wings of a butterfly  
I can chase the wind down the canyons of my mind  
I can catch it in the corner of my memory  
I can make it breathe a breath of life into an old love that has died  
And I can stand and reminisce a while  
In my mind I can be anything I want to be  
In my mind I can do anything I want to do  
Except make my mind forget you  
I can take a journey to the end of the rainbow  
I can go there and back and never leave my room  
I can change a heartache into a tiny snowflake  
And I can take December and turn it into June  
In my mind I can be anything I want to be...

(Dolly Parton)  
I can't be true no matter what I do  
It's a weakness of mine, nothin' to do with you  
So don't expect it of me though I expect it of you  
I love you, I do, but I can't be true  
Men are my weakness I've got a roving eye  
And I've fallen victim to many a smile  
I just love the excitement of love when it's new  
I'm just a hopeless romantic so I can't be true, I can't be true  
I can't be true no matter what I do  
It's a weakness of mine, nothin' to do with you  
So don't expect it of me though I expect it of you  
I love you, I do, but I can't be true, I can't be true  
Some play it safe while some like it hot  
I guess you could say I never knew when to stop  
But when I'm lovin' you, I'll give it all that I got  
It might be different with you to know I can't be true  
I can't be true no matter what I do  
Oh I get around, and I break all of the rules  
Now that you know it's true, I'll leave the rest up to you  
I'll be good to you, but I can't be true, I can't be true  
I can't be true no matter what I do  
It's a weakness of mine, its not a weakness in you  
So don't expect it of me though I expect it of you  
I really love you, I do, but I can't be true, I can't be true  
I can't be true no matter what I do  
Oh I get around, and I break all of the rules  
Now that you know it's true, I'll leave the rest up to you  
I'll be good to you, but I can't be true, I can't be true  

Oh sugar pie, honey bunch  
You know that I love you  
I can't help myself  
I love you and nobody else  
In and out my life  
You come and you go  
Leaving just your picture behind  
And I've kissed it a thousand times  
  
When you snap your fingers or wink your eye  
I come a running to you  
Tied to you like a ball-and-chain  
And there's nothing that I can do  
  
Can't help myself  
No, I can't help myself  
  
Sugar pie, honey bunch  
I'm weaker than a girl should be  
I can't help myself  
I'm a fool in love you see  
  
I wanna tell you I don't love you  
Tell you that we're through  
And I've tried  
But every time I see your face  
I get all choked up inside  
  
When I call your name  
Boy it starts the flame  
Burning in my heart  
Tearin' it all apart  
No matter how I try  
My love I cannot hide  
  
Sugar pie, honey bunch  
You now that I'm weak for you  
I can't help myself  
I love you and nobody else  
  
Ooh sugar pie honey bunch  
I'll do anything you ask me to  
I can't help myself  
I want you and nobody else  
  
Sugar pie, honey bunch  
You know that I love you  
I can't help myself  
No no no, I can't help myself

I couldn't wait forever  
Did you expect me to  
I guess you thought I'd never  
Find somebody new  
I lived on dreams and promises  
As long as I could  
I couldn't wait forever  
The way you thought I would  
The lonely nights grew longer  
As I prayed for time to fly  
I lived on hopes that you'd return  
And that's how I got by  
The agony of loneliness  
Just got too much for me  
I couldn't wait forever  
Needing love so desperately  
  
So I found new lips to kiss me  
New arms to hold me tight  
I found new love and happiness  
To fill these empty nights  
You took my love for granted  
Now my heart has found a new home  
I couldn't wait forever  
Forever's just too long  
I couldn't wait forever  
Forever's just too long

Last night, my tears they were fallin'  
I went to bed so sad and blue  
Then I had a dream of you  
I dreamed I was strollin' in the evenin'  
Underneath the harvest moon  
I was thinkin' about you  
And then you met me in the moonlight  
The stars were shining in your eyes  
But another was there too  
I don't believe you've met my baby  
You looked at her, you looked at me  
I wondered who you were talkin' to  
  
I shook the hand of your stranger  
But I was shaking more inside  
Cause I was still wonderin' who  
Your arm was restin' on her shoulder  
You smiled at her, she smiled at you  
Her eyes were filled with victory  
She said my brother wants to marry  
And then my heart was filled with ease  
I knew that you would marry me  
  
Oh, I don't believe you've met my baby  
You looked at her, you looked at me  
I knew that you would marry me  
I don't believe you've met my baby

You're standing much too close to me again  
I'd never once touched you  
But in my mind I've already sinned  
You're making it hard for me to be true  
I don't trust me around you  
  
Seems like every place I go I see you there  
I can't keep my eyes off you  
I just stand and stare  
You tempt me more than anyone I ever knew  
  
I don't trust me around you  
I don't trust me around you  
I belong to someone else  
Not once have I been untrue  
But when I'm close to you this way I find myself wanting to  
  
I don't trust me around you

You think you're so smart you think that you'd throw my heart  
Don't at your feet every time that you walk by  
But I, I got news for you cause I don't care for you and  
I don't care honey if you love me or not  
If you were half as smart as you think you are  
The world would be a-standing at your door  
But I, I won't be there cause I no longer care and  
I don't want you around me anymore  
  
Because you can't have your way you tell me every day  
I should grow up stop acting like a child  
But I, I think its you that's got some growing to do  
And honey I think its gonna take you quite a while  
  
If you were half as smart as you think you are  
The world would be a-standing at your door  
But I, I won't be there cause I no longer care and  
I don't want you around me anymore

I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.  
You think you know the smile on her lips  
The thrill and the touch of her fingertips  
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.  
You think you'll find heaven of bliss  
In each caress, in each tender kiss  
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.  
You stole her love from me one day  
You didn't care, oh, it hurt me  
But you can never steal away memories of what used to be.  
You think she's yours, to have and to hold  
Someday you'll learn, when her love grows cold  
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.

I get no kick from champagne  
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at'all  
So tell me why should it be true?  
That I get a kick out of you  
Some people go for cocaine  
I'm sure that if I took even one sniff  
That would bore me terrifically too  
Still I get a kick out of you  
  
I get a kick every time I see you  
Standin' there before me  
I get a kick though it's clear to see  
You obviously don't adore me, aww  
  
I get no kick in a plane  
Flying too high with some guy in the sky  
Is my idea of nothin' to do  
Still I get a kick out of you  
Yes I get a kick out of you
