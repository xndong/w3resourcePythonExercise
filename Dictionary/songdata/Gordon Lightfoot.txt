I saw a moonlit scene, I never will forget  
I stole a kiss at daybreak, I never did regret it  
Sometimes I wonder why I even try  
So why should I feel blue?  
I heard the sound of footsteps swaying in the dark  
I poked my head out silent, that's how it started  
What to my eyes appeared as dust  
Became a vision I don't know  
What had finally found me with my back against the wall  
Was destiny intruding all around me  
And as the day wore on I knew  
Another lonely night could never be  
If there's is a reason you might try and forget  
I'd like to find it 'cause I like to relive it  
Sometimes I wonder why I ever cry  
So why should I feel blue?  
I was caught drifting disappearing from the land  
Whitecaps in profusion all around me  
But somehow in our eyes I found the strength  
To sail upon the raging sea  
If theres a reason for the way that life is  
I'd like to find it after all who's life is it  
Sometimes I wonder why I even try  
So why should I feel blue?  
What had finally found me with my back against the wall  
Was destiny intruding all around me  
And as the days wore on I knew  
Another lonely night with you could never be  
I saw a moonlit scene I know it was real  
All that you can ever do when love is reveal  
Sometimes I every try why I even try  
So why should I feel blue?  
Sometimes I wonder why I ever cry  
So why should I feel blue?  

Beyond the wild misty mountain  
Within the valley so free  
There dwells a maid with a heart so mellow  
Soft as the wind and wild as the sea  
When will you love me  
As I love thee  
  
I have no gold to give her  
Nor gowns of soft crimson hue  
Nor poems of love no rhymes to bring her  
Into my heart so strong so true  
When will you love me  
As I love you  
  
Beyond the wild misty mountain  
Within the valley so free  
There dwells a maid with a heart so mellow  
Soft as the wind and wild as the sea  
When will you love me  
As I love thee

Once upon a time I was on my own  
Once upon a time like you've never known  
Once upon a time I would be impressed  
Once upon a time my life would be obsessed  
Once upon a time, once upon a day  
When I was in my prime, once along the way  
If you want to know my secret don't come runnin' after me  
For I am just a painter passing through in history  
Yesterday is gone, yesterday's alright  
Yesterday belongs in my dreams at night  
Yesterday is swell, yesterday is great  
Yesterday is strong, remembering can wait  
Once upon a time, once upon a day  
When I was in my prime, once along the way  
If you want to know an answer I can't turn your life around  
For I am just a painter passing through the underground  
I was in my stride, always at my game  
Here comes mister cool along the walk of fame  
I was in demand, always in control  
The world was in my hands, my touch had turn to gold  
Once upon a time, I was in a daze  
When I was in my prime, once along the way  
If you want to know my secret don't come runnin after me  
For I am just a painter passing through in history  
Now that I am old, let me rest a spell  
All that I am told, I can never tell  
Never in my life, never will it pass  
I am still alone, remembering at last  
Once upon a time, once upon a day  
When I was in my prime, once along the way  
If you want to know an answer I can't turn your life around  
For I am just a painter passing through the underground  
If you want to know my secret don't come runnin after me  
For I am just a painter passing through in history  

I see a place where candles burn and lovers rest tonight  
The hollow sound inside me now keeps telling me to write  
But songs of love will never leave love's feelings undefiled  
The tide has turned, the waves roll in, the waters fill my eyes  
  
The price of lust has risen till the ceiling will not stand  
The tears I shed were not in shame, the world was in my hands  
If trust was just a simple thing then trusting I would be  
But deep within my soul I know it's better to be free  
  
The days fly by, the waves roll in, but freedom has not come  
I fear my faith will soon give out, my senses come undone  
My role is played, the demon dogs come stealin' o'er land  
And foolish I would climb once more a tree too weak to stand  
  
I see a place where candles burn and lovers rest tonight  
The hollow sound inside me now keeps telling me to write  
But songs of love should not be sung where staying is not planned  
And foolish I would climb once more a tree too weak to stand  
And foolish I would climb once more a tree too weak to stand

The perfume that she wore was from some little store  
On the down side of town  
But it lingered on long after she'd gone  
I remember it well  
And our fingers entwined like ribbons of light  
And we came through a doorway somewhere in the night  
Her long flowing hair came softly undone  
And it lay all around  
And she brushed it down as I stood by her side  
In the warmth of her love  
And she showed me her treasures of paper and tin  
And we played a game only she could win  
And she told me a riddle I'll never forget  
Then left with the answer I've never found yet  
"How long", said she, "Can a moment like this  
Belong to someone?"  
"What's wrong, what is right, when to live or to die  
We must almost be born"  
So if you should ask me what secrets I hide  
I'm only your lover, don't make me decide  
The perfume that she wore was from some little store  
On the down side of town  
But it lingered on long after she'd gone  
I remember it well  
And she showed me her treasures of paper and tin  
And we played a game only she could win  
And our fingers entwined like ribbons of light  
And we came through a doorway somewhere in the night  

All I'm after is to be on your winning side  
All I need is to be turning back the tide  
'Cause I care too much for the life that I lead  
What you're thinking could be anybody's guess  
  
All I'm after is the sun and the summer nights  
By the seashore, don't want no more neon lights  
Just the sand and the sky as the hours roll by  
Ain't it funny, how the world seems to be back there in my dreams  
All I see is my reflection in your wild and winsome ways  
Ain't it funny, life feels different every day  
  
All I'm after is to be the flame in your tattoo  
Be the one girl who can thrill me through and through  
This is just a guess but I must confess  
It feels better being certain  
Please excuse my truthfulness  
What I'm seeing's worth believing  
When you thrill me like you do  
So you wonder why my feelings never fade  
I think I got it made  
  
In the evening when the rain begins to fall  
That's when I wonder if you think of me at all  
But you sound so sad, in your special way  
Ain't it funny, life feels different with each new passing day  
All I need is my reflection in your wild and windswept ways  
Ain't it funny how life changes every day

I remember everything  
I've learned about survival  
I've walked with fools and kings  
And I've even read the bible  
There I came upon some lines  
Givin' me direction  
Gather not your gold on earth  
Your kingdom is in heaven  
But I chose to live instead  
Inside the shell they gave me  
'til in spite of everything  
Good fortune came to find me  
I tried my best to run away  
But I could not avoid the feelin'  
Soon I was reelin' on my feet  
I made a grab at anything  
The earth was gone and I was on  
A vicious circle then  
After I'd gone and let myself surrender  
I didn't want to die at all  
I thought I'd live forever  
Then she gave me everything  
A king could never borrow  
But I twisted all her gifts  
Her wisdom was my sorrow  
So I left her cryin'  
And roamed across the river  
The angels offered me their hands  
But I could not forget her  
So I came to where she was  
By river, road and reason  
I slept beneath her window  
In the moonlight summer season  
But I could not go inside  
I heard the sound of laughter  
And the rustle of her hair upon his skin  
I made a grab at anything  
The earth was gone and I was on  
A vicious circle then  
After I'd gone to cry down my sorrow  
I didn't want to live no more  
Nor face the bright tomorrow  
Then I remembered everything  
I've learned about survival  
Havin' walked with fools and kings  
I've even read the bible  
I remember all those lines  
Givin' me direction  
Gather not your gold on earth  
It will not pass inspection  
And still I think when I'm alone  
Away from all night splendor  
If gold could buy one night with her  
I wish I had some to send her  

If you'd like to spend the afternoon approaching Lavender  
You'll feel just fine but one thing's sure  
You'll never be the same  
If you'd like to try your hand at understanding Lavender  
Then you must be very sure  
That life is not a game  
You might even learn a thing or two approaching Lavender  
You'll soon be on a one night tour  
Forgetting your own name  
You won't need a reason just to be alone with Lavender  
For the light so warm and pure  
Will draw you like a flame  
The colors that surround you there will be the shade of Lavender  
Shadows dancing everywhere  
Like flowers in the rain  
You will find your tongue's on fire while lying next to Lavender  
With words you never spoke before  
And will not speak again  
Oh sweet Lavender, I understand you perfectly  
There is no way that I can see  
You living by yourself  
Oh sweet Lavender, I must be with you constantly  
Your presence means so much to me  
Much more that life itself  
Oh sweet Lavender, as fragrant as the name you bear  
Please cast away the clothes you wear  
And give your love to me  
Oh sweet Lavender, your smile is like the golden sun  
I'd love to see you laugh and run  
As naked as the sea  
If you'd like to spend the afternoon approaching Lavender  
Don't try and get the best of her  
She will not share the blame  
If you'd like to try your hand at understanding Lavender  
Then you must be very sure  
That life is not a game  
There is no shame  

It's alright for some but not alright for me  
When the one that I'm lovin' slips around  
You think it's fine to do things I cannot see  
And you're doin' it to me, baby, can't you see  
That I know how it is?  
I can see it in your eyes  
And feel it in the way you kiss my lips  
I can hear it in your voice  
Whenever we are talking like this  
I can see what you believe in  
When his name is mentioned and I die  
I can watch the way you walk, the way you talk  
The way you close your eyes  
It's alright for some, but not alright to be  
Where the one that I'm lovin' can't be found  
The city where we live, might be quite large  
But the circle is small, why not tell us all  
And then all of us will know?  
I can see it in your eyes  
And feel it in the way you kiss my lips  
I can hear it in your voice  
Whenever we are talking like this  
I can see what you believe in  
When his name is mentioned and I die  
I can watch the way you walk, the way you talk  
The way you close your eyes  
It's alright to leave, but not alright to lie  
When you come home and you can't say where you've been  
You think it's fine to do, things I cannot see  
And you're doin' it to me, baby, can't you see  
That I know how it is?  
I can see it in your eyes  
And feel it in the way you kiss my lips  
I can hear it in your voice  
Whenever we are talking like this  
I can see what you believe in  
When his name is mentioned and I die  
I can watch the way you walk, the way you talk  
The way you close your eyes  
I can see it in your eyes  
And feel it in the way you kiss my lips  
I can hear it in your voice  
Whenever we are talking like this  
I can see what you believe in  
When his name is mentioned and I die  

Dee dee dee, dee dee dee, dee dee dee dee  
I would rather be at the boathouse, out of the daily grind  
I'd sooner be down at the boathouse, what a way to unwind  
Now I don't wanna know how it feels to be set back  
So I'm leavin' here on a one-way track  
I'd rather be in mosquito alley, out of my right hand lane  
You'd rather see my mosquiot tally, all that moves is fair game  
Now I don't wanna know how it feels not to be loose  
So I'm leavin' here on the first caboose  
I'm leavin' here on the first caboose  
I can't sleep by a gentle ocean and I can't sleep my a water fall  
I can't sleep by a lovely river, I can't sleep and I can't sleep  
Dee dee dee, dee dee dee, dee dee dee dee  
I would rather sleep at the boathouse, what more can I say  
I'd soon eat down at the boathouse, let it carry me away  
Now I don't wanna know how it feels to step aside  
So I'm leavin' here on a wicked ride  
Or I could be back at the alehouse, with a flagon or two  
A few blocks south of the jail house, with a hole in my shoe  
Now, I don't wanna know how it feels to stop a truck  
So I'm leavin' here and wishin' you good luck  
I'm leavin' here and wishin' you good luck  
I can't sleep by a deep ocean, I can't sleep by a water fall  
I can't sleep by a lovely river, I can't sleep and I can't sleep  
Dee dee dee, dee dee dee, dee dee dee dee  
I'd rather be in mosquito alley, keepin' spiders in line  
I'd sooner be down at the boathouse, what a way to unwind  
Now I don't wanna know how it feels not to be loose  
So I'm leavin' here on the first caboose  
I'm leavin' here on the first caboose  
Dee dee dee, dee dee dee, dee dee dee dee  
Dee dee dee, dee dee dee, dee dee dee dee  
Dee dee dee, dee dee dee, dee dee dee dee  

The night is as black as the coal dust on the tracks  
Up to the east day is dawning  
From time to time I get women on my mind  
I'm a son of a gun  
  
Borderstone, Borderstone gonna cross your line tonight  
Borderstone, pretty little town, gonna make my bed tonight  
  
The train that I'm on is a hundred boxcars long  
So I don't sleep through to the morning  
That's some chilly wind in this gondola I'm in  
I wish I had a glass of beer  
  
Borderstone, Borderstone gonna cross your line tonight  
Borderstone, pretty little town, gonna make my bed tonight  
Borderstone, Borderstone gonna cross your line tonight  
Borderstone, pretty little town, gonna make my bed tonight  
  
The boardinghouse reach is a thing no school can teach you  
I confess I've been outfumbled  
And the sound of the beans boiling through the evergreens  
Sure do please a hungry man  
  
Borderstone, Borderstone gonna cross your line tonight  
Borderstone, pretty little town, gonna make my bed tonight  
Borderstone, Borderstone gonna cross your line tonight  
Borderstone, pretty little town, gonna make my bed tonight  
  
The sound of the wheels rebounds across the fields  
I'm a name with no number  
And so I guess I'd be drifting more or less  
But still it's not meant to be  
  
Borderstone, Borderstone gonna cross your line tonight  
Borderstone, pretty little town, gonna make my bed tonight  
Borderstone, Borderstone gonna cross your line tonight  
Borderstone, pretty little town, gonna make my bed tonight  
Borderstone, Borderstone gonna cross your line tonight  
Borderstone, pretty little town, gonna make my bed tonight

Boss Man, Boss Man what do ya say  
I gotta get you alone in the mine some day  
Boss Man, Boss Man turn it around  
If you don't look away how can I sit down  
  
Look at this load upon my back  
Gotta get this wheel back on the track  
I can't hold on but I can't let go  
And I can't say yes I can't say 'no'  
  
Holes in my pockets and holes in my shoes  
If you're ready for me I'm ready for you  
The company plan takes all my pay  
Got a child in July and another last May  
  
Boss Man, Boss Man what do ya say  
Gonna get you alone in the mine some day  
Push your face down in the coal  
'Cause you got no heart you got no soul  
  
Country life's the life for me  
In ten more years I'll a pensioner be  
The younger lad knows when the girls are out  
But you might say he's a rural sprout  
  
Boss Man, Boss Man what do ya say  
Gonna get you alone in the mine some day  
Boss Man, Boss Man clear the track  
You're gonna tear the skin right offa my back  
  
Boss Man, Boss Man what do ya say  
If you can't lend a hand then get outta my way  
It'll be murder in the first degree  
If you ever lay your hands on me  
  
Boss Man, Boss Man pay my rent  
A dollar I've earned is a dollar I've spent  
The company plan takes all my check  
For breakin' my back and riskin' my neck  
  
Boss Man, Boss Man what do ya say  
I gotta get you alone in the mine some day  
I can't hold on but I can't let go  
And I can't say yes I can't say 'no

I spent most of my life outside, in the driving rain  
I was only trying to get by with some of life's amenities  
Well, nothing's free, I got more than I bargained for  
Now it's plain to see, I can't depend on love to defend me  
It took most of my time to do what never was done  
I was on the outside of an inside kind of love that now is gone  
Come right or wrong, it was laid to rest that way  
I hate to be unkind, pretending is for strangers who don't know you  
I spent most of my life outside in the driving rain  
I was in some one-horse town just waiting for a plane  
To take me back now where's that at, I paid the price  
Well, ain't that nice, knowing I'm so free?  
I can't depend on love to defend me  
I got more than I bargained for  
Now it's plain to see, I can't depend on love to defend me  

Pickin' up the pieces of my sweet shattered dream  
I wonder how the old folks are tonight  
Her name was Ann and I'll be damned if I recall her face  
She left me not knowin' what to do  
Carefree highway, let me slip away on you  
Carefree highway, you seen better days  
The mornin' after blues from my head down to my shoes  
Carefree highway, let me slip away  
Slip away on you  
Turnin' back the pages to the times I love best  
I wonder if she'll ever do the same  
Now the thing that I call livin' is just bein' satisfied  
With knowin' I got no one left to blame  
Carefree highway, got ta see you my old flame  
Carefree highway, you seen better days  
The mornin' after blues from my head down to my shoes  
Carefree highway, let me slip away  
Slip away on you  
Searchin' through the fragments of my dream-shattered sleep  
I wonder if the years have closed her mind  
I guess it must be wanderlust or tryin' to get free  
From the good old faithful feelin' we once knew  
Carefree highway, let me slip away on you  
Carefree highway, you seen better days  
The mornin' after blues from my head down to my shoes  
Carefree highway, let me slip away  
Slip away on you  
Let me slip away on you  
Carefree highway, got ta see you my old flame  
Carefree highway, you seen better days  
The mornin' after blues from my head down to my shoes  
Carefree highway, let me slip away  
Slip away on you

Sit by my side come as close as the air  
Sharin' a memory of grey  
And wander in my words  
And dream about the pictures that I play  
Of changes  
  
Green leaves of summer turn red in the fall  
To brown and to yellow they fade  
And then they have to die  
Trapped within the circle time parade  
Of changes  
  
Moments of magic will glow in the night  
All fears of the forest are gone  
For when the morning breaks  
They're swept away by golden drops of dawn  
Of changes  
  
Passions will part to a warm melody  
As fires will sometimes turn cold  
Like petals in the wind  
We're puppets to the silver strings of souls  
Of changes  
  
Your tears will be trembling now we're somewhere else  
One last cup of wine we will pour  
I'll kiss you one more time  
And leave you on the rolling river shore  
Of changes

I'm sailing down the summer wind  
I got whiskers on my chin  
And I like the mood I'm in  
As I while away the time of day  
In the lee of Christian Island  
  
Tall and strong she dips and reels  
I call her Silver Heels  
And she tells me how she feels  
She's a good old boat and she'll stay afloat  
Through the toughest gales and keep smiling  
But for one more day she would like to stay  
In the lee of Christian Island  
  
I'm sailing down the summer day  
Where fish and seagulls play  
I put my troubles all away  
And when the gale comes up I'll fill my cup  
With the whiskey of the highlands  
She's a good old ship and she'll make the trip  
From the lee of Christian Island  
  
Tall and strong she slips along  
I sing for her a song  
And she leans into the wind  
She's a good old boat and she'll stay afloat  
Through the toughest gales and keep smilin'  
When the summer ends we will rest again  
In the lee of Christian Island  
  
When the summer ends we will rest again  
In the lee of Christian Island

Rows of lights in a circle of steel  
Where you place your bets on a great big wheel  
High windows flickerin' down through the snow  
A time you know  
Sights and sounds of the people goin' 'round  
Everybody's in step with the season  
  
A child is born to a welfare case  
Where the rats run around like they own the place  
The room is chilly, the building is old  
That's how it goes  
The doctor's found on his welfare round  
And he comes and he leaves on the double  
  
Deck The Halls was the song they played  
In the flat next door where they shout all day  
She tips her gin bottle back till it's gone  
The child is strong  
A week, a day, they will take it away  
For they know about all her bad habits  
  
Christmas dawns and the snow lets up  
And the sun hits the handle of her heirloom cup  
She hides her face in her hands for a while  
Says look here child  
Your father's pride was his means to provide  
And he's servin' three years for that reason  
  
Rows of lights in a circle of steel  
Where you place your bets on a great big wheel  
High windows flickerin' down through the snow  
A time you know  
Sights and sounds of the people goin' 'round  
Everybody's in step with the season

Island goodbye, island goodbye  
We been too long together, my island and I  
'Cross the blue sea, 'cross the blue sea  
We been too long together, my island and me  
  
Cobwebs and dust, cobwebs and dust  
I hate to leave you but leave you, I must  
Float through the sky, float through the sky  
We been too long together, my cobwebs and I  
  
Troubles goodbye, troubles goodbye  
We been too long together, my troubles and I  
'Cross the blue sea, 'cross the blue sea  
We been too long together, my troubles and me  
  
Cobwebs and dust, cobwebs and dust  
I hate to leave you but leave you, I must  
Float through the sky, float through the sky  
We been too long together, my cobwebs and I  
  
Unlock the gate, unlock the gate  
Lower the drawbridge, the hour is late  
Whom shall it be? Whom shall it be?  
We been too long together, my drawbridge and me  
  
Cobwebs and dust, cobwebs and dust  
I hate to leave you but leave you, I must  
Float through the sky, float through the sky  
We been too long together, my cobwebs and I  
  
Tear down the walls, tear down the walls  
Gather my treasure and scatter it all  
'Cross the blue sea, 'cross the blue sea  
We been too long together, my island and me  
  
Run to her side, run to her side  
Run to my island and make her yer bride  
Whom shall it be? Whom shall it be?  
We been too long together, my island and me

I came down through Albany to New York  
To find what I'd been missin'  
I looked across the river to the city  
Where the windows all stood glistenin'  
I stood listenin'  
Into a tunnel I did rise, like a grave inside  
But I was young and able  
When I came out the other end  
Ah through the smoke, the winter light was feeble  
Unreadable  
I was optimistic though, a cabbie told me where to go  
I thanked him  
A face of white, a face of brown  
Ah here a smile and there a look of danger  
For a stranger  
It was too unreal for me  
I found no one who trusted me  
There was no man could offer me  
A cold hand from New York  
Cold hands from New York  
A voice within you cries, "Won't someone please help me  
I'll do the same for you one day  
If you should ever pass my way and need me"  
I came down to live alone in New York  
The city of the living  
There were fortunes at my feet but most of men  
Were taking, none we giving  
Or forgiving  
Children ran and children played and roses grew in alleyways  
I saw them  
There were men who lived in style and others who had died  
Where no one knew them  
Beause they couldn't win  
There were parks where old men slept and dingy rooms  
Where babies crept unwanted  
Till I began to ask myself if there were hope  
Or if it mattered what they did  
Or if they lived  
It was too unreal for me  
I found no one who trusted me  
There was no man could offer me  
A cold hand from New York  
Cold hands from New York  
A voice within you cries, "Won't someone please help me  
I'll do the same for you one day  
If you should ever pass my way and need me"  
I came down through Albany to New York  
To find what I'd been missin'  
I looked across the river to the city  
Where the windows all stood glistenin'  
I stood listenin'  
And there were prophets in the squares  
And people there who smiled and said, "Forget it"  
There were lovers in the park  
And there was danger in the dark, I felt it  
So afraid of it  
And there were preachers of the Word and poets  
Who were never heard, I heard them  
There were those who would not try to learn  
The measure of the lie they're livin'  
I heard a young musician play in a place  
Where they paid you not to listen  
I heard a woman scream for help while men stood by  
And offered their best wishes  
That's how it is  
It was too unreal for me  
I found no one who trusted me  
There was no man could offer me  
A cold hand from New York  
Cold hands from New York  
A voice within you cries, "Won't someone please help me  
I'll do the same for you one day  
If you should ever pass my way and need me"  
Cold hands from New York  
A voice within you cries, "Won't someone please help me  
I'll do the same for you one day  
If you should ever pass my way and need me"  
Cold hands from New York  
A voice within you cries, "Won't someone please help me  
I'll do the same for you one day  
If you should ever pass my way and need me"  

All you need is time  
All you need is time, time,  
Time to make me bend  
Give it a try, don't be rude  
Put it to the test and  
I'll give it right back to you  
  
It's cold on the shoulder  
And you know that we get  
A little older every day  
  
Kick it around, take it to town  
Try to defy what you feel inside  
You better be strong  
Your love belongs to us  
  
It's cold on the shoulder  
And you know that we get  
A little older every day  
  
All I need is trust  
All I need is trust, trust,  
Trust to make it show  
I don't want to know everything you done  
If you get a tip then tell it to the eskimos  
  
It's cold on the shoulder  
And you know that we get  
A little older every day  
It's cold on the shoulder  
And you know that we get  
A little older every day  
  
All we need is faith  
All we need is faith, faith,  
Faith to make it nice  
Kick it around, don't be rude  
If you're gonna make a mistake  
Don't you make it twice  
  
It's cold on the shoulder  
And you know that we get  
A little older every day  
It's cold on the shoulder  
And you know that we get  
A little older every day  
It's cold on the shoulder  
And you know that we get  
A little older every day  
It's cold on the shoulder  
And you know that we get  
A little older every day

There's a house on a hill  
By a worn down weathered old mill  
In the valley below where the river winds  
There's no such thing as bad times  
And a soft southern flame  
Oh Cotton Jenny's her name  
She wakes me up when the sun goes down  
And the wheels of love go 'round  
Wheels of love go 'round  
Love go 'round, love go 'round  
A joyful sound  
I ain't got a penny for Cotton Jenny to spend  
But then the wheels go 'round  
  
When the new day begins  
I go down to the cotton gin  
And I make my time worth while to them  
Then I climb back up again  
And she waits by the door  
Oh Cotton Jenny I'm sore  
And she rubs my feet while the sun goes down  
And the wheels of love go 'round  
  
Wheels of love go 'round  
Love go 'round, love go 'round  
A joyful sound  
I ain't got a penny for Cotton Jenny to spend  
But then the wheels go 'round  
  
In the hot, sickly South  
When they say we'll shut my mouth  
I can never be free from the cotton grind  
But I know I got what's mine  
She's a soft southern flame  
Oh Cotton Jenny's her name  
She wakes me up when the sun goes down  
And the wheels of love go 'round  
  
Wheels of love go 'round  
Love go 'round, love go 'round  
A joyful sound  
I ain't got a penny for Cotton Jenny to spend  
But then the wheels go 'round

There's a town they call Orillia, It is there of which I sing.  
It is just above Lake Simcoe, by Lake Couchiching.  
  
-Chorus-  
Couchiching, Couchiching, by Lake Couchiching.  
Cooooochiching, by Lake Couchiching.  
Couchiching, Couchiching, by Lake Couchiching,  
Coooochiching  
  
Across the raging Narrows, Casino Rama stands.  
Where there once were only sparrows, people come from other lands.  
To the west lie hills aplenty, if skiing is your thing,  
You can while away the summer, by Lake Couchiching.  
  
-Chorus-  
  
In Orillia they had movies, and sports and music too.  
And all around the shore line, were the folks that we all knew.  
  
-Chorus-  
  
Now I've spent my life in travel, now I've spent my life in dust.  
Now I've spent my life in family, now I've spent my life in trust.  
Any way you'd like to cut in, It'll hit you with a ping.  
When you think about Orillia, and it's by Lake Couchiching.  
  
-Chorus-  
  
When I get my final slumber, when I pawn my diamond ring,  
I will do my final number, by Lake Couchiching.  
  
-Chorus-

When first I did appear upon this native soil  
All up and down this country at labor I did toil  
I slumbered in the moonlight and I rose with the sun  
I rambled through the canyons where the cold rivers run  
  
When first I did come down where the land meets the sea  
The people said Who are you and what would your name be  
I said I have no home and I am no man's son  
'Twas inland I was born and from inland that I come  
  
In the good land I was young and I was strong  
No one dared to call me son  
Happy just to see my day's work done  
See my day's work done  
  
So I swung an axe as a timberjack  
And I worked the Quebec mines  
And on the golden prairie I rode the big combines  
I sailed the maritime waters of many a seaport town  
Built the highways and the byways to the western salmon grounds  
  
I've gazed upon the good times I've seen the bad times too  
Felt many a cold and bitter wind and many a mornin' dew  
I've watched the country growin' like a fair and mighty thing  
And on the still of a summer night I've heard the mountains ring  
  
In the good land I was young and I was strong  
No one dared to call me son  
Happy just to see my day's work done  
See my day's work done  
  
But now the seeds are planted and the gates are open wide  
The old ways are forgotten there's no place left to hide  
And the legacy I'm leavin' you is not very hard to find  
You'll see it all around you at this crossroads of time  
In the sweet soil it's a-growin' At the crossroads of time

She walks be the sea where the seaworld is  
And she waits for the man to come  
She lives in town with her high-heeled friends  
And she knows it's a long way down  
But she doesn't have to get up in the morning  
With her hair so soft and long  
  
Daylight Katy come on  
Daylight Katy come on  
If you can't follow me down  
Daylight Katy go home  
  
Daylight Katy come on  
Daylight Katy come on  
If you can't follow me down  
Daylight Katy go home  
  
She walks to the sea where the seaweed is  
Where the rust and the dirt runs deep  
She lives nine lives in her midnight world  
While her old man's fast asleep  
And she doesn't have to get up in the mornin'  
With her hair so soft and long  
  
Daylight Katy come on  
Daylight Katy come on  
If you can't follow me down  
Daylight Katy go home  
  
Daylight Katy come on  
Daylight Katy come on  
If you can't follow me down  
Daylight Katy go home  
  
She lives by the sea when the summer wind comes  
And the sea don't mind at all  
She talks to the sea when the sea runs wild  
And the waves run steep and tall  
And she doesn't have to get up in the mornin'  
With her hair so soft and long  
  
Daylight Katy come on  
Daylight Katy come on  
If you can't follow me down  
Daylight Katy go home  
  
Daylight Katy come on  
Daylight Katy come on  
If you can't follow me down  
Daylight Katy go home

It's so nice to meet an old friend and pass the time of day  
And talk about the home town a million miles away  
Is the ice still on the river, are the old folks still the same  
And by the way, did she mention my name  
  
Did she mention my name just in passing  
And when the morning came, do you remember if she dropped a name or two  
Is the home team still on fire, do they still win all the games  
And by the way, did she mention my name  
  
Is the landlord still a loser, do his signs hang in the hall  
Are the young girls still as pretty in the city in the fall  
Does the laughter on their faces still put the sun to shame  
And by the way, did she mention my name  
  
Did she mention my name just in passing  
And when the talk ran high, did the look in her eye seem far away  
Is the old roof still leaking when the late snow turns to rain  
And by the way, did she mention my name  
  
Did she mention my name just in passing  
And looking at the rain, do you remember if she dropped a name or two  
Won't you say hello from someone, they'll be no need to explain  
And by the way, did she mention my name

Does your mother know  
You had to go someday  
Does your mother know  
That you would go so fast  
Anyway, that's all you think about  
You'd call her if you could  
  
But the letters that you write  
In the faded winter light  
Just tell her they tell her  
That you've got ten dollars  
And you'll be all right  
And when you get straight  
You're gonna come back east some day  
  
Does your mother know  
You have a man in the West  
Does your mother know  
You drove him from your door  
Anyway that's all you think about  
You'd call her if you could  
  
Does your mother know  
You walked all day in the rain  
Does your mother know  
How deep your love could be  
Anyway that's all you think about  
You'd call her if you could  
  
But the letters that you write  
In the faded winter light  
Just tell her they tell her  
That you've got ten dollars  
And your rent costs eight  
And when you get straight  
You're gonna come back east some day  
  
But the letters that you write  
In the faded winter light  
Just tell her they tell her

Through the woodland, through the valley  
Comes a horseman wild and free  
Tilting at the windmills passing  
Who can the brave young horseman be  
He is wild but he is mellow  
He is strong but he is weak  
He is cruel but he is gentle  
He is wise but he is meek  
  
Reaching for his saddlebag  
He takes a battered book into his hand  
Standing like a prophet bold  
He shouts across the ocean to the shore  
Till he can shout no more  
  
I have come o'er moor and mountain  
Like the hawk upon the wing  
I was once a shining knight  
Who was the guardian of a king  
I have searched the whole world over  
Looking for a place to sleep  
I have seen the strong survive  
And I have seen the lean grown weak  
  
See the children of the earth  
Who wake to find the table bare  
See the gentry in the country  
Riding off to take the air  
  
Reaching for his saddlebag  
He takes a rusty sword into his hand  
Then striking up a knightly pose  
He shouts across the ocean to the shore  
Till he can shout no more  
  
See the jailor with his key  
Who locks away all trace of sin  
See the judge upon the bench  
Who tries the case as best he can  
See the wise and wicked ones  
Who feed upon life's sacred fire  
See the soldier with his gun  
Who must be dead to be admired  
  
See the man who tips the needle  
See the man who buys and sells  
See the man who puts the collar  
On the ones who dare not tell  
See the drunkard in the tavern  
Stemming gold to make ends meet  
See the youth in ghetto black  
Condemned to life upon the street  
  
Reaching for his saddlebag  
He takes a tarnished cross into his hand  
Then standing like a preacher now  
He shouts across the ocean to the shore  
Then in a blaze of tangled hooves  
He gallops off across the dusty plain  
In vain to search again  
Where no one will hear  
  
Through the woodland, through the valley  
Comes a horseman wild and free  
Tilting at the windmills passing  
Who can the brave young horseman be  
He is wild but he is mellow  
He is strong but he is weak  
He is cruel but he is gentle  
He is wise but he is meek

You've been in all my dreams since you've been gone  
Each mornin' that I wake up with the dawn  
Dream Street Rose I like the way you smile  
Dream Street Rose stay with me a while  
  
You gave more than anyone could ask  
You washed away all shadows from my past  
Dream Street Rose heaven only knows  
Dream Street Rose that's the way she goes  
Dream Street Rose let us not pretend  
Heaven knows will you love me  
Right 'til the end  
  
Somewhere in between there stands a dream  
The sweetest dream that we have ever seen  
Dream Street Rose I like the way you smile  
Dream Street Rose please stay with me a while  
Dream Street Rose I miss you when you're gone  
Heaven knows I'm gonna love ya  
From now on  
  
Dream Street Rose I like the way you smile  
Dream Street Rose stay with me a while  
Dream Street Rose heaven only knows  
Dream Street Rose that's the way she goes

You come to me in times of need  
When you can't find anyone  
You seem to be much better off now  
There's a rainbow number one  
We could see life through the gutter then  
Till it caused my heart to break  
There was too much toil in dreamland  
And too much love to take  
  
Sometimes I remember when  
We were all dressed up in still  
I don't recall the gist of it all  
But you drove the young men wild  
You could wrap me around your finger  
Till it caused my heart to break  
There was too much toil in dreamland  
And too much love to take  
  
So if you need me near you  
You can do it if you choose  
There was too much toil in dreamland  
And too much love to lose  
  
You make me do what you want me to do  
Then you run the rules on me  
You seem to be the wiser now  
Could it be you'be been deceived  
Anytime you felt like tryin'  
You would cause my heart to break  
There was too much toil in dreamland  
And too much love to take  
  
So if you need me near you now  
You can do it if you choose  
There was too much toil in dreamland  
And too much love to lose

I don't believe in miracles if it's all the same by you  
Your wishes would come true if I had my say  
Whether it's right or wrong, the words of every song  
Remind us of a love we knew  
Where love should not go wrong, in yesterdays  
Hang on ye drifters now  
You got so much to go and gamble on  
Watch out for the shifting sand  
Where ever you may ramble  
Even now, as I look back and see all that's come to pass  
I can't remember how it was I got here  
Look around this place, there's a smile on every face  
We're somewhere in the afterglow, out there among the stars  
Out there among the bars  
Hang on ye drifters now  
You got places to go and people to meet  
Watch out for the shifting tide  
Where ever you may travel  
I know I should not complain because life's been good to me  
It feels real good to be stranded on my own  
Be that as it may be, we are what we are  
I'll find you in the afterglow out there among the stars  
Of yesteryear  
Hang on ye drifters now  
You got so much to go and gamble on  
Watch out for the shifting sand  
Where ever you may ramble  
All you drifters now  
You got places to go and people to meet  
Watch out for the shifting tide  
Where ever you may travel  

Listen up and I'll tell you what you'll do  
Forget about music and alcohol too  
Forget about your baby  
We got other work for you  
Better drink yer glasses empty now  
It's time to rise and shine  
There's one less cause in the world  
To be leaving for  
It was back in 39  
When I was one year old  
Sitting by the backyard fence  
And the world had turned so cold  
Drink yer glasses empty now  
Was all that they were told  
Drink yer glasses empty now  
It's time to hit the sky  
To the tune of thunder  
There's no time to wonder why  
We'd love to take life over that is plain  
Forget about sorrow, forget about pain  
And watch a John Wayne movie  
To remind us once again  
Better drink yer glasses empty now  
It's time to hit the line  
You got one less cause in the world  
To be leaving for  
Drink yer glasses girls and boys  
It's time to hit the sky  
To the tune of thunder  
There's a tear in every eye  
I'd like to take things one at a time  
Forget about reason, forget about rhyme  
Because beg, steal or borrow  
You got another hill to climb  
So drink yer glasses empty now  
It's time to hit the road  
There's one less cause in the world  
To be leaving for  
Drink yer glasses girls and boys  
It's time to hit the sky  
To the tune of thunder  
There's no time to wonder why  
We'd like to take life over again  
When time of war had passed away into the rain  
And watch a John Wayne movie  
To remind us of the plains  
Just drink yer glasses empty now  
It's time to rise and shine  
There's one less cause in the world  
To be leaving for  
Listen up and I'll tell you what is true  
They done some thinking and they changed a thing or two  
You been living in the hindsight  
Of a backwards point of view  
So drink yer glasses empty now  
It's time to hit the road  
There's one less cause in the world  
To be leaving for  

In the early mornin' rain  
With a dollar in my hand  
And an aching in my heart  
And my pockets full of sand  
I'm a long ways from home  
And I missed my loved one so  
In the early mornin' rain  
With no place to go  
  
Out on runway number nine  
Big seven o seven set to go  
Well I'm out here on the grass  
Where the pavement never grows  
Where the liquor tasted good  
And the women all were fast  
There she goes my friend  
She's rolling out at last  
  
Hear the mighty engines roar  
See the silver wing on high  
She's away and westward bound  
For above the clouds she flies  
Where the mornin' rain don't fall  
And the sun always shines  
She'll be flying over my home  
In about three hours time  
  
This ol' airport's got me down  
It's no earthly good to me  
Cause I'm stuck here on the ground  
Cold and drunk as I might be  
Can't jump a jet plane  
Like you can a freight train  
So I best be on my way  
In the early mornin' rain  
So I best be on my way  
In the early mornin' rain  
So I best be on my way  
In the early mornin' rain

Put me somewhere east of midnight  
West of the turnpike  
Anywhere I wander  
Is where I'll take my rest  
As I lie down, toss some thoughts around  
Dreams I'm told will come true if you  
Believe in those who love you right now  
Sea of dreams I long for you  
Forget about the others  
This is my hike, you can come if you like  
To feel good, I would help you if I could  
But I am out here searching  
For the things that might have been  
I need no more reminders  
Not one love letter have I seen  
And that's a pretty good start  
The ocean is where lovers meet again  
Sea of dreams by all means  
Float me out of danger until then  
Forever amen  
It's a long, long hike  
We'll be leavin' early travelin' light  
That's alright heaven will be ours tonight  
The road is paved with moonbeams  
There are faces that I knew  
They all came back to haunt me  
But that ain't fair to the folks like me and you  
It takes a bit of my heart  
Tonight I shall be watching from the shore  
Sea of dreams from now on  
Forget about all the others  
Back where the line forms  
Destination sea of storms  
By all means ever onward sea of dreams  
Put me somewhere east of midnight  
Along about daylight  
Anywhere I wander  
Is where I'll take my rest  
If we could just lie down, love  
Toss some thoughts around  
It's a tough and a dirty long hike  
You can come if you like  
If we could just lie down  
Toss some thoughts around  

I can always try to forget somehow  
What's a part of the past  
Have a little laughter if you please  
I won't even mind if it takes awhile  
I've got time on my hands  
I feel another chapter in the breeze  
And somebody touched my heart string  
Somebody made my heart sing  
And somebody stole my heart away  
Nobody's sayin' their sorry  
It's a mighty sweet music  
You can dance all night  
Put some wood on the fire right now  
Ecstasy made easy  
Ecstasy I ask you, are you a name  
Or just another patron with a smile?  
Let me analyze you, are you a flame  
Or just the dying embers of a kiss run wild?  
Somebody found my heart string  
Somebody made my heart sing  
And somebody touched my heart last night  
Somebody set me in flight  
It's a mighty sweet music  
Take a chance they say  
Put flame on the old iron stove  
Ecstasy made easy  
It's a mighty sweet music  
Take a chance they say  
Put some fire on the old iron stove  
Ecstasy made easy, made easy  
I hope I never lose what belongs to me  
By the right of my birth  
At midnight sailing out of Perth  
Getting under way we turned westward bound  
On that southern sea  
To sea what ecstasy was worth  

I was at the break wall, I was lookin' at the sea  
In back of the eight ball in some misery  
There on the horizon stood a mighty ship of fools  
They were headin' into the harbor with all their broken rules  
Whenever I'm feelin' lonely I can just pick up the phone  
Or I can go to the movies or just stay at home alone  
They're better off to be someplace that's a good long way from home  
Any way I can lose myself  
Dawn is breakin', I'm hesitatin'  
I'm fading away, fading away  
They sailed right up to me, I said, "What's it all about  
Please try to excuse me, we can work things out  
If you've ever wondered if that mighty ship is real  
Let me tell ya 'bout it, brother, it was somethin' you could feel"  
Whenever I'm feelin' lonely, I let twilight set the tone  
Or I can go to the movies or just stay at home alone  
They're better off to be someplace, that's a good long way to roam  
Ain't livin' high on the hog right now  
Dawn is breakin', I'm hesitatin'  
I'm fading away, fading away  
One more day on the calendar in my mind  
I am down at the break wall puttin' in some time  
The whole ship of fools has gotten safely under way  
And I was proud to be a part of what it was they had to say  
Whenever I'm feelin' lonely I can just pick up the phone  
Or I can go to the movies or just stay at home alone  
They're better off to be someplace that's a good long piece from home  
Any way I can lose myself  
Dawn is breakin', I'm hesitatin'  
I'm fading away, fading away  
Fading away, fading away  

Where did ya go when the snow lay on the ground  
What did ya do when the rain began to fall  
How did it feel when I looked through your soul  
When was the last time you wanted my love  
How many nights did you cry your dreams to sleep  
Why did you hide what you knew would not stay hidden  
How could you put yourself through like you did  
I'm not the kind that would hold you that way  
Drop me a line if ya wake up feelin' bad  
I'm still a friend and I'd like to hear from you  
Where does it say love should last forever  
When was the last time I told that to you  
Farewell to annabel, farewell  
Farewell to annabel, farewell  
Farewell to annabel, fare thee well  
Farewell to annabel, farewell  

You're as soft as the rose  
You're as sweet as the honey  
You're as warm as the bright morning sun  
You're as cool as the breeze on the last days of April  
You're as fine as fine can be  
  
You're like time is to space  
You're like faith is to trustin'  
You're like blue is to feelin' unkind  
You're like joy is for love,  
You're like dreams are for chasin'  
You're as fine as fine can be  
  
And when I am gone my thoughts are all with you  
You're my little angel you see  
You're as bright as the moon  
You're as light as a feather  
You're as fine as fine can be  
  
Like the rain is for the crops  
You're like food for my thoughts  
You're like true is for knowin' what's not  
You're like leaves are for trees  
You're like bees are for buzzin'  
You're as fine as fine can be  
  
You're as bright as the moon  
You're as light as a feather  
You're as fine as fine can be

That's what you get for lovin' me  
That's what you get for lovin' me  
Ev'ry thing you had is gone  
As you can see  
That's what you get for lovin' me  
  
I ain't the kind to hang around  
With any new love that I found  
'Cause movin' is my stock in trade  
I'm movin' on  
I won't think of you when I'm gone.  
  
So don't you shed a tear for me  
Because I ain't the love you thought I'd be  
I got a hundred more like you  
So don't be blue  
I'll have a thousand 'fore I'm through  
  
Now there you go you're cryin' again  
Now there you go you're cryin' again  
But then someday when your poor heart  
Is on the mend  
Well I just might pass this way again  
  
That's what you get for lovin' me  
That's what you get for lovin' me  
Everything you had is gone  
As you can see  
That's what you get for lovin' me  
That's what you get for lovin' me

I'm on my way, got no time to waste  
Places to go, people to chase  
Gonna grab my comb 'n' my toothpaste  
Gotta get away from here  
Twenty-one years from the day I was born  
I was workin' on the night shift, tootin' my horn  
Through sheets of rain, through sleet and storm  
You come to me  
You were the girls with the summer sunshine  
In your eyes and in your smile  
You were the one I thought, I thought loved me  
It was somethin' I never could quite believe  
Gotta get away from here  
I'm a real bad loser, that's what I am  
Gonna grab my hat and my hexagram  
You can stick my money in an old tin can  
I think I fell in love again  
I was down by the bus stop, bidin' my time  
I was hitchin' a ride with a friend of mine  
I was almost gone, I was over the line  
I said what's come over me  
You were the girl with the sound of springtime  
In your songs and in your voice  
You were the one I thought, loved me  
It was somethin' I never could quite believe  
Gotta get away from here, gotta get back to you  
I'm gonna make it today, I'm gonna get on my toes  
Been awake so long, I'm getting ready to doze  
Gonna grab my bag and a few old clothes  
Gotta get away from here, gotta get back to you  
Gotta get away, gotta get away, gotta get away  
Gotta get away, gotta get away  

I go in for singing,  
I do it for my pay  
But the kind of gig  
I can really dig  
Is swiggin' at the break of day  
With a few good friends and neighbors  
Into playin' the nighttime tunes  
So pass the jar and that old guitar  
In this hangdog hotel room  
  
I believe in magic,  
A little monkeyshines  
But the kind of row I can really hoe  
Is playin' in tune on time  
With rhythms all around us  
We're like weavers at the loom  
So pass the jar and that old guitar  
In this hangdog hotel room  
  
Oh Lord it feels so good  
To play a nighttime tune  
So pass the jar and that old guitar  
In this hangdog hotel room  
  
When it comes to mornin'  
And goin' out at night  
Well the kind of test that I like the best  
Is rubbin' the wrong girl right  
And a few good friends and neighbors  
In to playin' the nighttime tunes  
So pass the jar and that old guitar  
In this hangdog hotel room  
  
Oh Lord it feels so good  
To play a nighttime tune  
So pass the jar and that old guitar  
In this hangdog hotel room  
With rhythms all around us  
We're like weavers at the loom  
So pass the jar and that old guitar  
In this hangdog hotel room

In this land of chance do we know right from wrong  
Even at a glance we know the road is long  
We don't owe a single thing to anyone  
  
Most of us do not believe in come what may  
Everything we fought for was in vain they say  
Even when called upon to throw our lives away  
  
We have been captured by the thieves of the night  
Held for ransom if you please  
Heaven help the devil may he have a few unpleasnt memories  
  
In these times of trial and uncertainty  
I have thought what does this freedom mean to me  
Is it just some long forgotten fantasy  
  
Our love for each other may not be explained  
We live in a world where tears must fall like rain  
Most of us don't wish to cause each other pain  
  
We have been captured by the thieves of the night  
Held for ransom if you please  
Heaven help the devil may he have a few unpleasnt memories  
  
To every unsung hero in the universe  
To those who roam the skies and those who roam the earth  
To all good men of reason may they never thirst  
  
We have wings to guide us through the timeless sea  
And faith that will remain through all eternity  
We try to be helpful to the ones in need  
  
We have been captured by the thieves of the night  
Held for ransom if you please  
Heaven help the devil may he have a few unpleasant memories

Hey you upon this ship of fools  
I have found you bending your own rules  
Thank you I don't mind if I do  
Dream a while of the lovin' that we knew  
  
There was such a flaming time  
I never will forget  
It was all so easy then  
This is my one regret  
  
Hey you my angel in blue  
Mother Nature saved her best for you  
Green grow the lilacs on the wall  
Heaven help them, catch them as they fall  
  
Hey you angel in disguise  
What is your angle what is your surprise  
Hey you fever that is mine  
What is your game plan what is your design  
  
Reality brings mystery  
And ne'er the twain shall meet  
And all of my wild horses  
Cannot pull you off your feet  
  
Hey you angel on my mind  
All around me til the end of time  
Thank you I don't mind if I do  
Dream a while of the lovin' that we knew  
  
There was such a flaming time  
I never will forget  
It was all so easy then  
This is my one regret  
  
Hey you my angel in blue  
I'm entangled tell me what to do  
Green grow the lilacs on the wall  
Heaven help them catch them as they fall

Oh the neon lights were flashin'  
And the icy wind did blow  
The water seeped into his shoes  
And the drizzle turned to snow  
His eyes were red, his hopes were dead  
And the wine was runnin' low  
And the old man came home  
From the forest  
  
His tears fell on the sidewalk  
As he stumbled in the street  
A dozen faces stopped to stare  
But no one stopped to speak  
For his castle was a hallway  
And the bottle was his friend  
And the old man stumbled in  
From the forest  
  
Up a dark and dingy staircase  
The old man made his way  
His ragged coat around him  
As upon his cot he lay  
And he wondered how it happened  
That he ended up this way  
Getting lost like a fool  
In the forest  
  
And as he lay there sleeping  
A vision did appear  
Upon his mantle shining  
A face of one so dear  
Who had loved him in the springtime  
Of a long-forgotten year  
When the wildflowers did bloom  
In the forest  
  
She touched his grizzled fingers  
And she called him by his name  
And then he heard the joyful sound  
Of children at their games  
In an old house on a hillside  
In some forgotten town  
Where the river runs down  
From the forest  
  
With a mighty roar the big jets soar  
Above the canyon streets  
And the con men con but life goes on  
For the city never sleeps  
And to an old forgotten soldier  
The dawn will come no more  
For the old man has come home  
From the forest

I want to hear it from you  
I want to hear it from someone who knows how it is  
All the second-hand words seem to get in my way  
I want to hear it from you  
  
I want to hear it again  
I want to know if the soft scented touch of your lips  
Must be taken away like a mother's first kiss to the life that she gives  
  
I've got a right to get it straight from you  
To give my life a different point of view  
To find a way to keep from losing you  
  
If you don't know what to say  
To understand is my life and the question is why  
You should cry in the night while your eyes look away  
Every time that I speak and there's nothing to say  
  
I want to hear it from you  
I want to hear it from you  
Let me know how you feel  
You've got to make up your mind  
Tell me where I can run  
When my roof tumbles in  
  
I want to hear it from you  
I want to hear it from you

A one man band on a one night stand  
As a one man band should be  
The cried for more, he replied why sure  
And he played one just for free  
The sounds he laid down. the songs he played  
Made the ladies all come to call  
He was born in the back of a Seminole bus  
On the road to Niagara Falls  
  
I'd do it again, I'd do it again  
I'd do it again  
  
The one man band philosophical man  
Didn't lie when he said to us  
I seen the high rollers come and go  
It's the holy rollers I trust  
The man said then he was sixteen when  
He retired from the county school  
A wee bit thin with a will to begin  
He was known to be know man's fool  
  
I'd do it again, I'd do it again  
I'd do it again  
  
The one man band was a mighty good man  
Cause he played 'til the break of dawn  
He ups and downs about four more rounds  
And he stayed 'til the crowd went home  
It seemed to me like he never could be  
Like anything I'd ever seen before  
When he stepped from the stage  
With his ax in his hand  
And he run through the backstage door  
  
I'd do it again, I'd do it again  
I'd do it again  
  
A one man band on a one night stand  
As a one man band should be  
They cried for more, he replied why sure  
And he played one just for free

Is it my imagination or is it my iron pride  
I wonder if it matters much if time is on my side  
I'd rather press on, I don't wanta rest easy  
Anywhere I stray, I will make it a brand new day  
Anyway, that is all I've gotta say  
I'd rather be by the seaside  
Than be playing a one night stand  
I've been too wrapped up in my own dreams  
I will change things if I can  
I gotta press on, don't wanta rest easy  
Wouldn't it feel fine to return to the women and the wine  
And all of the sunshine that we knew  
You will never know what blue is  
Until you have played the game  
Till you live life in solitaire where  
No one knows your name  
I'd rather press on, I don't want to rest easy  
Have it anyway you will  
I will be with you right up until  
The spell is broken and all is well  
If you'd rather be by the seashore  
Well, I sure can understand  
Are you too wrapped up in your own scene  
I would change things if I can  
I'd rather press on, don't want to rest easy  
Wouldn't it feel fine  
But remembering the rhythm and the rhymes  
And all of the good times makes me blue  
Wouldn't it feel fine to return to the women and the wine  
And all of the sunshine that we knew  

There's a love I hold dear  
And it shines through each year  
And it makes things seem different somehow  
It's for better or worse  
It's for people who thirst  
For a love that burns brighter right now  
  
And it shines on and on 'til all sadness is gone  
And if children had wings I would sing them this song  
With a smile on my face and a tear in my eye  
Everything will be fine by and by  
  
There were things that were said  
There were things that were done  
And a wife cannot stand too much pain  
And what I thought was best  
Couldn't please her much less  
But my love still goes on, that don't change  
  
And it shines on and on 'til all sadness is gone  
And if children had wings I would sing them this song  
With a smile on my lips and a tear in my eye  
Everything will be fine by and by  
  
And it shines on and on 'til all sadness is gone  
And if children had wings I would sing them this song  
With a smile on my face and a tear in my eye  
Everything will be fine by and by  
  
And it shines on and on 'til all sadness is gone  
And if children had wings I would sing them this song  
With a smile on my face and a tear in my eye  
Everything will be fine by and by

If it should please you, I have come to play  
A glad or a sad tune, I wrote along the way  
And a few good songs about the old highway  
I been around so long, Lord, I guess, I'm here to stay  
So I'm itching to please you with a topical song  
And a few golden oldies and a little hoedown  
And I think, I know how to make you feel  
We're one and the same now like a big flywheel  
I have seen the best of all those things you can't explain  
Wanderlust, I did not trust but I never did complain  
So if it should please you, put away those blues  
Just settle on back now, I'll do my licks for you  
It's my own way and that's the way it goes  
You're a real good reason for a real good show  
I have seen the best of all those things you don't forget  
Wanderlust, I did not trust and I ain't been done in yet  
So if you got the dead end of the dealing shoe  
This is your last chance, man, we belong to you  
It's my own way and that's the way I feel  
We're one and the same now like a big flywheel  
So if it should please you, I have come to play  
A glad or a sad tune, I wrote along the way  
And a few good songs about the old highway  
I been around so long, Lord, I guess, I'm here to stay  
We're one and the same now, let's take it away  
We're gonna take it real easy, let's take it away  
We're gonna take it real easy, take it away  
We're gonna take it real easy  

If you should need me deep in the night  
My arms around you in shades of twilight  
If there's a reason for livin' without me  
Just let me know and I'll move on  
  
Down to the station with the big wheels burnin'  
Gonna get my ticket to play out that role which I've been given  
  
Home is where the heart is  
But at times a good home must be broken  
The wine has grown bitter  
From the harsh words we have spoken  
  
If there's a chance for someone else  
To make you feel life is worth livin'  
Give it a try oh lady  
Just let me know and I'll move on  
  
Home is where the heart is  
But at times a good home must be broken  
The wine has grown bitter  
From the harsh words we have spoken  
  
If you should need me deep in the night  
At shades of twilight  
If there's a reason for livin' without me  
Just let me know and I'll go on livin'

You've got time enough for two of us  
What is mine, I will share  
We've got things that we can do without  
Most anytime, anywhere  
Every little daydream that appears in all we do  
Gives us some problems of our own  
If you turn back to that page again  
And you can't win, if you ask me, I'll tag along  
Paper matches in the afternoon  
Cups of tea and all of that Zen  
I think, it's time we took a walk outside  
It seems there is no oxygen  
This time tomorrow, we might all be packed and gone  
I believe, it's best we carry on  
Smoke rings rising 'til they disappear  
In the sky above, if you ask me, I'll tag along  
Each and every bad dream will be hammered into dust  
When we get back where we belong  
If you ever turn that page again  
You need a friend, if you ask me, I'll tag along  
This time tomorrow, we might all be packed and gone  
I believe, it's best we carry on  
Smoke rings rising 'til they disappear  
In the sky above, if you ask me, I'll tag along  

I'm not sayin' that I love you  
I'm not sayin' that I'll care if you love me  
I'm not sayin' that I'll care  
I'm not sayin' I'll be there when you want me  
  
I can't give my heart to you  
Or tell you that I'll sing your name up to the sky  
I can't lay the promise down  
That I'll always be around when you need me  
  
Now I may not be alone each time you see me  
Along the street or in a small cafe  
But still I won't deny or mistreat you  
Baby if you let me have my way  
  
I'm not sayin' I'll be sorry  
For all the things that I might say that make you cry  
I can't say I'll always do  
The things you want me to  
I'm not sayin' I'll be true but I'll try  
  
Now I may not be alone each time you see me  
Or show up when I promised that I would  
But still I won't deny or mistreat you  
Baby if you love me like you should  
  
I'm not sayin' I'll be sorry  
For all the things that I might say that make you cry  
I can't say I'll always do  
The things you want me to  
I'm not sayin' I'll be true but I'll try  
I can't say I'll always do  
The things you want me to  
I'm not sayin' I'll be true but I'll try

I think you have somebody waiting  
Outside in the rain to take you away  
You got places to go, you got people to see  
Still I'm gonna miss you  
But anyway  
  
I wish you good spaces in  
The far away places you go  
If it rains or it snows may  
You be safe and warm and never grow old  
And if you need someone who loves you, why  
You know I will always be there  
I'll do it although I'm not supposed to care  
  
I'll give you the keys to  
My flying machine if you'd like  
I will show you the light and when you call  
I'm gonna come to you  
And when you find someone who loves you,  
I'll know you would treat me the same  
Just lie there, you're not supposed to care  
  
I think you have somebody waiting  
Outside in the rain to take you away.  
That's some kind of a game  
Still I'm glad it came down  
To the final round  
But anyway  
  
If you think you need someone who needs you,  
You know I will always be there  
I'll do it although I'm not supposed to care  
I'll do it although I'm not supposed to care

There's a warm wind tonight  
And the moon turns the tide  
When the stars take their ride  
She'll be leavin'  
Where she goes, I don't know  
She won't tell me what it is  
Makes her act like this  
But I've got a funny feelin' that it's me  
It's worth believin'  
Should I ask  
"Do you like to go walking on the shore  
And listen to the sea?"  
Or could it be someone kind?  
Could it be that I'm the fool?  
There's somethin' wrong with you  
I've got a funny feelin' that it's me  
It's worth believin'  
There's a breeze from the shore  
And the waves overlap  
When I've called in the cat  
She'll go walkin'  
And she cries to herself  
In the night when I'm asleep  
She lies awake and weeps  
Could it be something new  
Some one old who has returned?  
Or is it just a game?  
But I've got a funny feelin' that it's me  
It's worth believin'  
There's a warm wind tonight  
And the moon turns the tide  
When the stars take their ride  
She'll be leavin'  
Where she goes, I don't know  
She won't tell me what it is  
That makes her act like this  
Should I ask  
"Do you like to go walking on the shore  
And listen to the sea?"  
Or could it be someone kind?  
Could it be that I'm the fool?  
There's somethin' wrong with you  
I've got a funny feelin' that it's me  
It's worth believin'  

Love and maple syrup goes together  
Like the sticky winds of winter when they meet  
When lonely lovers come to rest  
Beneath the trees they do their best  
But still they can't be free  
Looking for the world to be  
Anything but what they see  
Longing to be understood  
By the heart that shapes the wood  
  
If you go into the forest, gaze up through the leaves  
And see the sky that's almost wild  
You must learn to understand  
What makes the forest greet the man  
Like a mother's only child  
  
In the north when when winter's claw  
Relaxes now to keep the laws of nature in control  
People come and stand in line  
To rob the forest of her wine  
But they don't feel the cold  
  
Looking for the world to be  
Anything but what they see  
Longing to be understood  
By the heart that shapes the wood  
  
Love and maple syrup goes together  
Like the sticky winds of winter when they meet  
When lonely lovers come to rest  
Beneath the trees they do their best  
But still they can't be free  
  
Love and maple syrup shine like  
Embers warm, like thoughts divine  
They tell us it is spring  
Love and maple syrup stir  
The thoughts of people into words  
Of songs that they can sing  
  
Looking for the world to be  
Anything but what they see  
Longing to be understood  
By the heart that shapes the wood

It is said that all the good things  
Must come to him who can pretend  
He doesn't have to wait  
For as surely as the light of day  
Must come to drive the night away  
The needles and the pins  
That's where the line begins  
  
With your magnificent outpouring  
Of that old familiar story  
That's been used a million times  
To ease a million minds  
  
There are times when I have told you  
That there must be two of us  
To try to work things out  
But if I can't see you every day  
Then I must hide my thoughts away  
And see you when I can  
And try to understand  
  
With your magnificent outpouring  
Of that old familiar story  
That's been used a million times  
To ease a million minds  
  
So let us treat our love likeany game  
To fan the flames would really be a sin  
For as surely as the snow must fall  
I shall be waiting for your call  
Pretending it is spring  
And you'll be mine again  
  
With your magnificent outpouring  
Of that old familiar story  
That's been used a million times  
To ease a million minds

Some life I've been livin'  
Like a song in the night  
Good sounds every moment  
Good news and bright lights  
Anytime I get lonesome  
I just got to do the things right  
Make way for the lady  
You can do it my son  
Makin' hay with no gravy  
Brings the good folk down  
Anytime you get lonely  
You just got to turn it around  
  
This life I've bin given  
It don't tell you no lies  
Could've been somewhat wasted  
How could it be otherwise  
When the sound of the laughter  
Brought the tears in to my eyes  
  
Make way for the lady  
You can do it my son  
Makin' hay with no gravy  
Gets the day's work done  
When a blue mood gets rollin'  
You just got to turn it around  
Turn it around  
  
Shake hands with the father  
The son and the holy ghost  
The impossible believers  
And the heavenly host  
If you must do it better  
You just got to do it the most  
  
Make way for the lady  
You can do it my son  
Makin' hay with no gravy  
Brings all the good folks down  
When a blue moon starts risin'  
You just got to turn it around  
Turn it around  
Turn it around  
  
Make way for the lady  
And turn it around

Now have you seen the lighthouse shining from the rock  
For the ship Marie Christine and all her gallant lot  
Now have you seen the lighthouse, oh we are close to land  
Cried the brave young captain to his wretched band  
Now have you seen the harbor cried Marie Christine  
Have you seen the jagged rocks in the waters in between  
Now have you seen the lighthouse, oh save me if you can  
For if you do I promise you I'll never sail again  
Now have you seen the lighthouse shining from the rock  
Cried the brave young captain to his wretched lot  
Now gather all your photographs and don your coats of blue  
If anyone can save us now, Marie Christine it is you  
When at first I saw Marie Christine the woman that she was  
I signed aboard to man her sails and honor well her cause  
I christened her with old champagne and I drove her to the west  
Of all the men who sailed on her, in truth I sailed her best  
Now have you seen the lighthouse shining from the rock  
For the ship Marie Christine and all her gallant lot  
Now have you seen the lighthouse, oh we are close to land  
Cried the brave young captain to his wretched band  
Now come all you would be sailors  
All you would be sailors, oh, all you would be sailors  
If anyone can save us now, Marie Christine it is you  
If anyone can save us now, Marie Christine it is you  

Finders, keepers, losers, weepers  
Ring around the rosy  
And I'll catch you if I can  
And if you don't say may I,  
Then you'll have to start again  
But first you must indulge me  
And count from one to ten  
Let the game begin  
  
I adore you when you touch me  
Pin the tail upon the donkey,  
You will surely win  
And if you don't say may I,  
Then I'll pass the cake around  
And I won't give you any,  
But you won't make a sound  
You don't eat soap, anyhow  
  
Red light, green light,  
Blue light, yellow light  
You can take three giant steps  
Or a baby step will do  
But if you don't say may I,  
Then I'll march you out the door  
Where you'll be contemplating  
The numbers one to four  
I hope you're keeping score  
  
'Cause if you don't say may I,  
Then I'll get you with the hose  
And spoil your Sunday clothes  
Will it please you if I tease you  
While you're at the spindry,  
I'll pass the pie around  
But you won't make a sound  
You don't eat blackbird anyhow  
  
There's four and twenty reasons  
Why it can't be wrong  
How long have you been gone  
Finders, keepers, losers, weepers  
Peter, Peter, pumpkin eater  
Wear your sneakers around sound sleepers

The minstrel of the dawn is here  
To make you laugh and bend your ear  
Up the steps you'll hear him climb  
All full of thoughts, all full of rhymes  
Listen to the pictures flow  
Across the room into your mind they go  
Listen to the strings  
They jangle and dangle  
While the old guitar rings  
The minstrel of the dawn is he  
Not too wise but oh so free  
He'll talk of life out on the street  
He'll play it sad and say it sweet  
Look into his shining face  
Of lonelines you'll always find a trace  
Just like me and you  
He's tryin' to get into things  
More happy than blue  
  
A minstrel of the changin' tide  
He'll ask for nothing but his pride  
Just sit him down upon that chair  
Go fetch some wine and set it there  
Listen to the pictures flow  
And follow the fingers where they go  
Listen to the strings  
They jangle and dangle  
While the old guitar rings  
  
A minstrel of the dawn is near  
Just like a step 'n fetchit here  
He's like an old time troubador  
Just wanting life and nothing more  
Look into his shining eyes  
And if you see a ghost don't be surprised  
Like me and you  
He's tryin' to get into things  
More happy than blue  
  
The minstrel boy will understand  
He holds a promise in his hand  
He talks of better days ahead  
And by his words your fortune's read  
Listen to the pictures flow  
Across the room into your mind they go  
Listen to the strings  
They jangle and dangle  
While the old guitar rings  
  
The minstrel of the dawn is gone  
I hope he'll call before too long  
And if you meet him you must be  
The victim of his minstrelsy  
He'll sing for you a song  
The minstrel of the dawn

Pretty faces everywhere  
A few hard cases stop and stare  
They've got charm that is not right  
Pretty faces late at night  
Morning Glory what's the story?  
Will it ever end?  
I've been all the way to Biscayne Bay  
And all the way back again  
All the way back again  
I remember our old rendezvous  
The key was kept inside a shoe  
Those moments will remain frozen in time  
Morning Glory's on my mind  
What's the story Morning Glory?  
Will it ever end?  
I've been all the way to Biscayne Bay  
And all the way back again  
All the way back again  
It seems like only yesterday  
She married me and carried me away  
I found out what life was all about  
Morning Glory threw me out  
Hey, Morning Glory what's the story?  
Will it ever end?  
I've been all the way to Biscayne Bay  
And all the way back again  
All the way back again  
Alimony, Palimony, puts a dent in me  
I've been all the way to Biscayne Bay  
For a dip in the shining sea  
A dip in the shining sea  
Pretty faces everywhere  
A few hard cases stop and stare  
Even when I know it ain't my day  
A lot of good faces anyway  
Morning Glory what's the story?  
What is it to be?  
I've been all the way to Biscayne Bay  
For a dip in the shining sea  
A dip in the shining sea  
What's the story Morning Glory?  
Will it ever end?  
I've been all the way to Biscayne Bay  
And all the way back again  
All the way back again  
Morning Glory what's the story?  
Will it ever end?  
I've been all the way to Biscayne Bay  
And all the way back again  
All the way back again  

Gotta make your mind up  
Every single day  
(I) hate to see you lonely  
Losin' me this way  
Lookin' for the man  
Who stole my love from me  
Gotta know the reason  
Why my baby's leavin'  
My pony won't go  
Where I want him to go no more  
Gotta make your mind up  
If you're gonna stay  
I don't see no sense in  
Anything you say  
Since you met the guy  
Who told you I was wrong  
You do all the livin'  
While I do all the givin'  
My pony won't go  
He can't find no oats to eat  
Gotta make your mind up  
Every single day  
(I) hate to see you lonely  
Losin' me this way  
Lookin' for the man  
Whole stole my love from me  
Gotta know the reason  
Why my baby's leavin'  
My pony won't go  
Where I want him to go no more  

I remember when best friends were jealous lovers  
Lyin' warm asleep beneath the covers  
Dreaming of belonging to each other  
And so we tried, never too close  
Never too near, dyin' in time  
And so we cried but that is alright  
We meant no one no harm  
  
I remember when best friends were no mistaken  
Long before that freedom was forsaken  
Learnin' 'bout all the good things  
In the world worth believin'  
And so we tried, never too close  
Never too near, dyin' in time  
And so we cried but that is alright  
We meant no one no harm  
  
I remember when jealous lovers would stick together  
When the days were warm and the nights more tender  
When the bonds of truth were not made to measure  
And so we tried, never too close  
Never too near, dyin' in time  
And so we cried but that is alright  
We meant no one no harm  
Try, try as you will  
Following dreams never fulfilled  
And so we cried but that is alright  
We meant no one no harm

We've got to stay together  
We've got to find each other now  
That is how we can learn all about the other man's song  
On the plains of abraham  
When they sent the lamb to die  
You and I were asleep in the rock of ages  
Remember the unborn children still to come  
If you need me and I need you  
There's nothin' else needs sayin'  
Understand it  
I'm not too deaf to hear the song you're playin'  
Nous vivons ensemble  
Nous nous connaissons maintenant  
Voici comment nous pouvons decouvrir une autre humanite  
Sur les plaines d'abraham  
Lors do dernier sacrifice  
Toi et moi nous dormions tres loin dans le temp  
Souviens toi des enfants qui attendant encore  
Si tu me veux je serai la see'est tout ce que j'ai a dire  
Car comprend moi  
Je ne suis pas sourd a la musique que tu joues  

I think this time you've said enough  
To make me want to leave this place  
Still I keep coming back for more of  
The same to fan the dying flame  
Here inside these walls that seem  
To move a little closer every day  
There must be a way out of  
This crazy game we play out to the end  
Let us just pretend a while  
Think about the good things now and then  
  
I think this time that was the best time  
That we two had ever known  
We tried the handle of the house  
Upon the shore and found the open door  
Once inside we found a curious moonbeam  
Doing dances on the floor  
We were only playing like two children  
Who had stayed away from school  
Two of us could not be wrong  
Heaven knows who keeps the golden rule  
  
I think this time we've learned enough  
To know that nothing is the same  
But still the pounding of my heart  
Hasn't changed and leavin's so strange  
Here among my thoughts of you  
I find a gentle longing to be free  
There must be a way out of  
This crazy game we play out to the end  
Take away the in-between  
Think about the good things now and then  
We will see the day when you  
Or I will stay or face up to the end  
Let us just pretend a while  
And think about the good things now and then

The oceans of the world were the home of big blue  
He was the greatest monster that the world ever knew  
And the place that he loved best  
Was the waters to the west  
Around the blue Pacific he did roam  
  
Big Blue moved alone for a mighty blue was he  
And the battles of the whales was an awesome sight to see  
And he took them one by one and he drove them all away  
In the mating of the day he was the king  
  
Big blue had fifty wives and he sired forty sons  
Though most of them feel victim to the cruel harpoon guns  
Ah but he was too much wise to get caught by the gunners' eyes  
And so he lived at sea a hundred years  
  
His mouth was as large as a tunnel so they say  
His hide was thick as leather and his eyes quick and small  
And his back was all scarred by the times he got away  
And he knew the smell of whalers did Big Blue  
  
Big Blue passed away to his natural decay  
Beside the Arctic Circle as he travelled up that way  
And there never was a man who was born with a gunner's hand  
Who ever took a pan to Big Blue  
  
Now the gray whale has run and the sperm is almost done  
The finbacks and the Greenland rights have all passed and gone  
They've been taken by the men for the money they could spend  
And the killing never ends, it just goes on  
  
The oceans of the earth were the home of big blue  
He was the greatest monster that the world ever knew  
And the place that he loved best was the waters to the west  
Around the blue Pacific he did roam

Oh Linda you done me wrong  
I'm gonna sing you a goodbye song  
Sing a song that's most unkind  
I ain't even gonna try to change your mind  
  
Oh Linda you made me grieve  
I feel like I could die  
Look out baby the moon is falling  
Down from your sky  
  
Oh gal don't you say goodbye  
Now that I need you by my side  
Love me now or be on your way  
If you go be gone to stay  
  
I saw Linda late last night  
Dressed for town she looked alright  
Painted eyes and lips like wine  
Walkin' on down with a friend of mine  
  
Oh gal don't you say so long  
I feel like I could die  
Look out baby the moon is falling  
Down from your sky  
  
Oh gal don't you be unkind  
I ain't even gonna try to change your mind  
Love me now or be on your way  
If you go be gone to stay  
  
Oh Linda you made me grieve  
I feel like I could die  
Look out baby the moon is falling  
Down from your sky  
  
Oh gal don't you say goodbye  
Now that I need you by my side  
You can have everything I own  
Take everything but a-come on home  
  
Oh gal don't you say so long  
I feel like I could die  
Look out baby the moon is falling  
Down from your sky  
  
Oh gal don't you do me wrong  
I'm gonna sing you a goodbye song  
Sing a song that's most unkind  
I ain't even gonna try to change your mind

Get out old Dan's records  
Get out old Dan's records  
We will Dance the whole night long  
It's fun to play the old time songs  
If old Dan could see us now  
I know he'd be so proud  
Bring out old Dan's records  
Bring out old Dan's records  
I remember my aunt Bea  
She'd dance with Dan till two or three  
If old Dan could see he now  
I know he'd shout out loud  
Dig out old Dan's records  
Bring out old Dan's records  
We're all here, we've all got dates  
We'll dance all night to the seventy-eights  
If old Dan could see us now  
I know he'd be so proud  
If old Dan were with us still  
I know he'd come around  
Get out old Dan's records  
Dig out old Dan's records  
Back to nineteen thirty-five  
The foxtrot, jitterbug 'n' jive  
If old Dan could see us now  
I know he'd be so proud  
Get out old Dan's records  
Bring out old Dan's records  
High above the fireplace  
There's a smile on old Dan's face  
If old Dan could see us now  
I know he'd be so proud  
If old Dan were with us still  
I know he'd come around  

Like crippled ships that made it  
Through a storm and finally reached a quiet shore  
The homeless found a home on Susan's floor  
  
Didn't feel so cold and tired  
Stretched out before her fire  
Rollin' smokes and drinkin' up her wine  
And I remember candlelight  
And singing 'til we could not sing no more  
Then fallin' warm asleep on Susan's floor  
  
Well now that my song is sweeeter  
I think I'd like to greet her  
And thank her for the favors that she gave  
A stranger I came  
My head bowed in the rain to her door  
I sat and sang my songs on Susan's floor  
  
In the mornin' I'd go on  
Buyin' kingdoms with my songs  
Knowin' I'd be back in just a while  
Warm in the sunlight of her smile  
  
Well lots of time and songs have passed  
I catch myself just looking back  
Reliving all the wonder of those nights  
That's where I'd be today  
If I had only stayed one night more  
And sang another song on Susan's floor  
  
Like crippled ships that made it  
Through a storm and finally reached a quiet shore  
The homeless found a home on Susan's floor

See the people walkin' up and down  
See the people movin' all around  
On the streets of my hometown, on Yonge Street  
Longest street in the world they say  
Summertime soon slips away  
I hope I'll see you one fine day on Yonge Street  
Everywhere you go in a city by the lake  
Back there in the flow you may give a hand a shake  
Everyone you pass seems to wanna say hello  
Even late at night on the freshly fallen snow  
See the children jumpin' all around  
See the parents looking up and down  
Upon the streets of my hometown, on Yonge Street  
It's a mean street if you choose  
It's a lean street when you loose  
An' in between street when you cruise along Yonge Street  
Everywhere you go in a city by the lake  
You'll be sure and find it's a case of give and take  
Everyone you pass seems to wanna say hello  
Even late at night when the streets are all aglow  
It's the longest street in the world  
With the most feet in the world  
Another street where boy meets girl on Yonge Street  
See the people walkin' up and down  
See the people movin' all around  
Those are the streets of my hometown, on Yonge Street  
Everywhere you walk people almost say hello  
Even late at night when the streets are all aglow  
On Yonge Street  
On Yonge Street  

Does the light of passion still burn bright?  
Only love would know my imagination  
Tells me I'm a pent-up fool in the deep end of the pool  
Is the light of passion burnin' tonight?  
Only love would know, only love would know  
She lives on the other side, you wanna know the reason why  
She arrives at promises and you believe in what she says  
Everywhere you go  
Is the light of passion burnin' bright?  
Everywhere you go, only love would know  
You think, you've been wronged again  
Oh what a way to treat a friend  
She belongs to other eyes and surely you must realize  
She ain't the kind who would soon step aside  
Pay any dues at the expense of her pride  
Everywhere she goes, only love would know  
In the days gone by I came to believe  
Everything is trust, all the rest is dust  
Mother nature, mother dear, listen to us over here  
Are the sounds of laughter ringing true?  
Only love would know, only love would do  
She lives on another plane away from the drivin' rain  
She says no, you say yes  
And that's how it should be I guess  
Only love would know  
May the light of love surround you tonight  
Everywhere you go, only love would know  
You think, you were wrong until  
You learned once and for all it's still  
One more lesson on the way  
Or that is what it seemed to say  
She's not the kind who would soon step down  
Not the kind you would try to walk around  
When only a thought would go very well  
You can tell by the touch  
Ah but only love would know  
Passion burnin' bright  
Tears of passion late at night  
Is the light of passion burning bright?  
Everywhere you go, only love would know  

Try to understand  
I'm not your ordinary man, still I can't deny  
You go with me everywhere  
When I'm dreamin' you still share my lonely nights  
Try to see my side  
It's not your ordinary pride that keeps drivin' me on  
It's that lonesome, restless feelin' that you feel under the gun  
And it leads me to the highways but it keeps my body warm  
  
And as I wander to the cities and the towns  
I get so lonesome knowin' you could be around  
And when the show is over, there's a holiday motel  
Another empty bottle and another tale to tell  
  
Try to comprehend  
I'm not your ordinary friend at the end of my life  
I would pray that I could be  
Returning to the shelter of your love  
Try to see my side  
It's not your ordinary pride that keeps drivin' me on  
It's that lonesome, restless feelin' that you feel under the gun  
And it leads me to the highways but it keeps my body warm  
  
And as I wander to the cities and the towns  
I get so lonesome knowin' you could be around  
And when the show is over, there's a holiday motel  
Another empty bottle and another tale to tell  
  
Try to understand  
I'm not your ordinary man, still I can't deny  
You go with me everywhere  
Like a shadow in the gloom  
I remember all the good times  
There's a ghost in every room

The dead leaves of autumn  
That cling so desperately  
Must fly before the cold October winds  
Their simple lives have ended  
Must they be born to die again  
  
Oh may the light of freedom shine  
For all the world to see  
And peace and joy to all mankind  
Through all the years to be  
  
For soon the leaves will die  
And the long hard wind will blow  
May this world find a resting place  
Where the peaceful waters flow

Poor little Allison standing in the night wind  
Laughing out loud turning her face to the summer rain  
Poor little Allison never had much going  
Hard to forget, always in step with the world she's in  
Never knowing, never feeling, showing so much pride  
Never saying what she's thinking or feeling deep inside  
Poor little Allison, dreaming of the right one  
Laughing out loud, lost in a crowd of fair weather friends  
Never knowing, never feeling, showing so much pride  
Never saying what she's thinking or feeling deep inside  
Poor little Allison, standing in the night wind  
Wishing out loud, turning her face to the summer rain  
Hard to forget, always in step with the world she's in  

Turn around go back down go back the way you came  
Can't you see the flash of fire ten times brighter than the day  
And behold the mighty city broken in the dust again  
Oh God the pride of man broken in the dust again  
  
Turn around go back down go back the way you came  
Babylon is laid to waste Egypt's buried in her shame  
Their mighty men are beaten down the kings are fallen in the ways  
Oh God the pride of man broken in the dust again  
  
Turn around go back down go back the way you came  
Terror is on everyside though the leaders are dismayed  
Those who put their faith in fire in fire their faith shall be repaid  
Oh God the pride of man broken in the dust again  
  
Turn around go back down go back the way you came  
Shout a warning to the nations that the sword of god is raised  
On Babylon that mighty city rich in treasure wide in fame  
It shall cause thy towers to fall and make it be a pyre of flame  
Oh God the pride of man broken in the dust again  
  
Thou that dwell on many water rich in treasure wide in fame  
Bow unto a god of gold thy pride of might shall be thy shame  
Oh God the pride of man broken in the dust again  
  
And only God can lead the people back into the faith again  
Thy holy mountain be restored thy mercy on thy people Lord

Who are these ones who would lead us now?  
To the sound of a thousand guns  
Who'd storm the gates of hell itself?  
To the tune of a single drum  
  
Where are the girls of the neighborhood bars?  
Whose loves were lost at sea?  
In the hills of France and on German soil  
From Saigon to Wounded Knee  
  
Who come from long lines of soldiers?  
Whose duty was fulfilled?  
In the words of a warrior's will  
And protocol  
  
Where are the boys in their coats of blue?  
Who flew when their eyes were blind?  
Was God in town for the Roman games?  
Was he there when the deals were signed?  
  
Who are the kings in their coats of mail?  
Who road by the cross to die  
Did they all go down into worthiness?  
Is it wrong for a king to cry?  
And who are these ones who would have us now  
Whose presence in concealed  
Whose nature is revealed  
In a time bomb  
  
Last of all you old sea dogs  
Who travel after whale  
You'd storm the gates of hell itself  
For the taste of a mermaid's tail  
Who come from long lines of skippers  
Whose duty was fulfilled?  
In the words of a warrior's will  
And protocol

You think you had the last laugh  
Now you know this can't be true  
Even though the sun shines down upon you now  
Sometimes you must feel blue  
You make the best of each new day  
You try not to be sad  
Even though the sky falls down upon you  
Call it midnight, feelin' bad  
  
[Chorus: ]  
When you wake up to the promise  
Of your dream world comin' true  
With one less friend to call on  
Was it someone that I knew  
Away you will go sailin'  
In a race among the ruins  
If you plan to face tomorrow  
Do it soon  
  
The road to love is littered  
By the bones of other ones  
Who by the magic of the moment  
Were mysteriously undone  
You try to understand it  
But you never seem to find  
Any kind of freedom comin' clean  
Is just another state of mind  
  
[Chorus: ]  
  
So take the best of all that's left  
You know this cannot last  
Even though your mother was you maker  
From her apron strings you pass  
Just think about the fool  
Who by his virtue can be found  
In a most unusual situation  
Playin' jester to the clown  
  
[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

In the name of love she came  
This foolish winsome girl  
She was all decked out like a rainbow trout  
Swimmin' up stream in the world  
And she said "Please, please, I've lost my way  
The current is too strong  
In the name of love, kind sir I pray,  
In the name of love"  
  
So I took her by the hand,  
She took me by the will  
She was all dolled up like a blue eyed pup  
Looking for something to spill  
And she said "Please, please, I've lost my way  
The current is too strong  
In the name of love, kind sir I pray,  
In the name of love"  
  
In the name of love she came  
This foolish winsome girl  
She was all decked out like a rainbow trout  
Swimmin' upstream in the world  
And she gave one flip  
Of the rainbow tip of her tail  
And she swam back down  
  
And she said "Please, please, I've lost my way  
The current is too strong  
In the name of love, kind sir I pray,  
In the name of love

Rainy day people always seem to know when it's time to call.  
Rainy day people don't talk  
They just listen till they've heard it all.  
Rainy day lovers don't lie when they tell you  
They've been down like you.  
Rainy day people don't mind if you're cryin' a tear or two.  
  
If you get lonely, all you really need is that rainy day love.  
Rainy day people all know there's no sorrow  
They can't rise above.  
Rainy day lovers don't love any others  
That would not be kind.  
Rainy day people all know how it hangs  
On their peace of mind.  
  
Rainy day lovers don't lie when they tell you  
They've been down there, too.  
Rainy day people don't mind if you're cryin' a tear or two.  
  
Rainy day people always seem to know  
When you're feelin' blue  
High stepping strutters who land in the gutters  
Sometimes need one, too.  
Take it or leave it or try to believe it,  
For you've been down too long,  
Rainy day lovers don't hide love inside, they just pass it on.  
  
Rainy day lovers don't hide love inside, they just pass it on.

Four months ago in April on a daycoach she came down  
And the dust autumn winds begin to blow  
Shoulda known I couldn't hold livin' out so far from town  
And the nights to come are long are slow to go  
Well now she's up and left me and when walkin' down the line  
And the dusty autumn wind begins to blow  
All dressed up in red velvet and he high heeled shoes so fine  
And the nights to come are long and slow to go  
Well if I had only know before we kissed  
You can't keep red velvet on a poor dirt farm like this  
Oh now she's gone and left me and went walkin' down the line  
And the dusty autumn winds begin to blow  
Well I'll sit and count the evening stars as they walk around  
When the dusty autumn winds begin to blow  
Then I'll call my dog and I'll take the truck and I'll drive on into town  
Cause the nights to come are long and slow to go  
Well I'll sit and count the evening stars as they walk around  
When the dusty autumn winds begin to blow  
Then I'll call my dog and I'll take the truck and I'll drive on into town  
Cause the nights to come are long and slow to go  
And those dusty autumn winds begin to blow  

I climbed the Redwood Hill  
'Twas on a rainy day  
To rise above the throng  
And talk with Mother Nature for a while  
She told me of her love  
For the children in her trust  
And of her grave concern  
For the likes of you and me and us  
Crying though she was  
She did speak these tender words  
The things that I am  
I could not change for any man  
I tried to comfort her  
Ah, but she would not be still  
And how the rain did fall  
As I found my way back down the Redwood Hill  
Crying though she was  
She did speak these tender words  
The things that I am  
I would not change for any man  
I tried to comfort her  
Ah, but she would not be still  
I'll not forget that day  
When Mother Nature cried on Redwood Hill  
I'll not forget that day  
When Mother Nature cried on Redwood Hill  

Remember me I'm the one who hurt you, dear  
Hurt you, hurt you, dear.  
  
Remember me I'm the one who loved you, dear  
Loved you, loved you, dear.  
  
I'm the one who ran away and left you all alone  
I'm the one who broke your heart and scorned the love I've known.  
  
Remember me I'm the one who's sorry now,  
Sorry, sorry, now.  
  
I'm the one who ran away and left you all alone  
I'm the one who broke your heart and scorned the love I've known.  
  
Remember me I'm the one who's sorry now,  
Sorry, sorry, dear.

There's a kind of a restless feeling and it pulls me from within  
It sets my senses reeling and my wheels begin to spin  
In the quietude of winter you can hear the wild geese cry  
And I will always love that sound until the day I die  
There's a plain and a simple answer to each and every quest  
From every quiet dance who might be a special guest  
In a movie made for TV or a late night interview  
You might even find them on the Young and the Restless too  
Do ya get that restless feelin' when you hear a whistle blast  
Like an echo from the past  
Of an old engine flyin' down a road that's iron cast  
The lake is blue, the sky is gray, the leaves have turned to gold  
The wild goose will be on her way, the weather's much too cold  
When the muskie and the old trout too have all gone down to rest  
We will be returning to the things that we love best  
Do ya get that restless yearning when you think about your dad  
And the scrimshaw that he had  
Of an old schooner rovin' 'neath a sky that's ironclad  
There's a kind of a restless feeling and it catches you off guard  
As we gaze off at the distance through the trees in my back yard  
I can feel that restless yearning of those geese as off they roam  
Then trade that for a warm bed and a place I can call home  
Will ya get that restless yearning when you hear the wicked blast  
Of a specter from the past  
Of a cold diesel rollin' down a road that's built to last  
Still I get that restless feelin' when I hear a whistle blast  
See an image from the past  
Of an old schooner flyin' down a sky that's overcast

Hear the call of the ringneck loon  
Hear the sound, he will be home soon  
Hear the cry in the afternoon  
Ringneck Loon, he knows best  
He's a loon and he don't care less  
Ringneck loon, away off shore  
How could anybody ask for more  
Hear the call of the ringneck loon  
Hear the sound, he will be home soon  
Hear the cry in the afternoon  
Ringneck loon, he can't rest  
He's a loon and he don't care less  
Ringneck loon around the bend  
Been a loon since he don't know when  
Hear the call of the ringneck loon  
City life is what I see  
City life is the life for me  
Ringneck loon, he knows best  
He's a loon and he don't care less  
Hear the cry of the ringneck loon  
Hear the sound he will be home soon  
Hear the cry in the afternoon  
Ringneck loon, you can't rest  
You're a loonie and you don't care less  
Ringneck loon, my old friend  
Been a loon since he don't know when  
Hear the cry of the ringneck loon  
Hear the sound, he will be home soon  
Hear the cry in the afternoon  

You said you were through with romance  
Why take a chance on anyone  
You're so beautiful too  
I can tell by the way that you dance  
They say that people don't change  
Why rear range the original  
You do something to me  
That my eyes cannot see at a glance  
Signs of a new beginning  
Signs of a life worth living  
The better to forget than to be all that upset  
It's the time to taste the wine  
And maybe someday things will change  
And come with in range and be laughable  
Everything is okay  
I can tell by the way that you dance  
They say that people don't try  
That's just a lie, they work miracles  
It's a gift from above  
When we talk about love and romance  
Signs of a new tomorrow  
Signs of a life without sorrow  
The better to forget than to be all that upset  
It's the time to taste the wine  
And maybe this time you will be  
Romantic like me when I'm with you  
And I think you might say  
I can tell by the way that you dance  
They say that people don't change  
Like 'Home On The Range', it's original  
You do something to me  
That my eyes cannot see at a glance  
You do something to me  
When we talk about love and romance  

I'm not some long lost someone  
Just dropped in to say hello  
It's that same old lover man  
Baby you lost so long ago  
'Cause I was born to believe  
I never could deceive, believe me  
I hear no children's voices  
Have they gone back to school  
And that same old lover man  
Is still acting like a fool  
I guess I was born to bring you grief  
Though I never was a thief, believe me  
It's cold outside your window  
Please let me in, the night is wild  
It's that same old lover man  
Not some lonesome winsome child  
An' I was born to believe  
I never could deceive  

I feel a little blue 'cause I can't sew  
There's still a lot of things that I should know  
Anyone can guess  
I don't know how to press  
My Saturday clothes  
And everyone's goin' home  
I feel a little sad to watch them leave  
But I'll be cool because I don't believe  
The happy times are gone  
I can still put on  
My Saturday clothes  
Every warm body knows  
I've got to tell you that was a swell time  
Now I'll take the butts away  
And put the glasses on the tray  
I'll see you all next Saturday  
I feel a little off because they're gone  
And if my gal were here I'd still be on  
But in a week or two  
There's lots of things to do  
In my Saturday clothes  
And everyone's gone home  
I've got to tell you that was a swell time  
So now I'll take the butts away  
And put the glasses on the tray  
I'll see you all next Saturday  

I'm on my second cup of coffee and I still can't face the day  
I'm thinking of the lady who got lost along the way  
And if I don't stop this trembling hand from reaching for the phone  
I'll be reachin' for the bottle, Lord, before this day is done  
  
I'm on my second cup of coffee and I still can't face the day  
The room was filled with laughs as we danced the night away  
But my sleep was filled with dreaming of the wrongs that I had done  
And the gentle sweet reminder of a daughter and a son  
  
Sitting alone, my friends have all gone home  
You never know when they'll come droppin' in  
Thinking of girls with their fingers in my curls  
Too young to understand how love begins  
  
I'm on my second cup of coffee and I still can't face the dawn  
The radio is playin' a soft country song  
And if I don't stop this trembling hand from reaching for the phone  
I'll be reachin' for the bottle, Lord, before this day is done

Won't you reach out, love and touch me  
Let me hold you for awhile?  
I been all around the world  
Oh, how I long to see you smile  
There's a shadow on the moon  
And the waters here below  
Do not shine the way they should  
And I love you just in case you didn't know  
Let it go  
Let it happen like it happened once before  
It's a wicked wind and it chills me to the bone  
And if you do not believe me  
Come and gaze upon the shadow at your door  
Won't you lie down by me, baby  
Run your fingers through my hands?  
I been all around the town  
And still I do not understand  
Is it me or is it you?  
Or the shadow of a dream?  
Is it wrong to be in love?  
Could it be the finest love I've ever seen?  
Set it free  
Let it happen like it happened once before  
It's a wicked wind and it chills me to the bone  
And if you do not believe me  
Come and gaze upon the shadow at your door  
Please kiss me gently, darling  
Where that river runs away  
From the mountains in the spring time  
On a blue and windy day  
Where there's beauty all around  
As the shades of night grow deep  
When the morning stars grow dim  
They will find us in the shadows fast asleep  
Let it go  
Let it happen like it happened once before  
It's a wicked wind and it chills me to the bone  
And if you do not believe me  
Come and gaze upon the shadow at your door  

Ah, the living ain't easy  
With all of these false emotions  
Too little devotion and I'm tired of just  
Being alone, she's not the same  
She's a son of a gun, she's a red hot flame  
She lights the sun and conjures up the rain  
  
Like any good gambler  
I was chained to a wishing well  
I keep wishing in vain, but listen friend  
Don't look now, she's right behind you  
Looking for someone to take her inside  
It thrills her so, it's a rainbow ride  
  
I'm a little uneasy  
And there ain't much pride inside me  
She don't know how it hurts and I'm telling you  
It's too late now, she's not the same  
She's a red hot kid, she's a crying shame  
  
Anytime is the right time  
To get on with a new tomorrow  
But I could never let yesterday go  
And when the falling rain makes me sad  
She comes to me in the dreams I've had  
In the morning light, in the dead of night  
  
Ah, the loving ain't easy  
I let it get the best of me  
She don't know how it hurts and I'm telling you  
It's too late now, she don't talk no more  
She don't make me feel like she did before  
There's too much wait and too much give and take  
  
I'm a little uneasy  
And there ain't much pride inside me  
She don't know how it hurts and I'm telling you  
It's too late now, she's not the same  
It's too late now, she's not the same  
It's too late now, she's not the same

Momma's got her long dress on  
See how that little girl walks  
Now we got it rollin'  
How're we gonna get it stopped  
Momma's got something  
Daddy needs more than a lot  
Now we got it rolling,  
How're we gonna get it stopped  
Momma put your long dress on  
I'd like to take that little girl to town  
Now that we have rolled it,  
How're we gonna hold it down  
Gonna slide on over to that pretty little love that I've found  
Now we've got it rolling,  
How're we gonna hold it down  
  
Now momma's got her long dress on  
Listen to that little girl talk  
Now we got it rolling,  
How're we gonna get it stopped  
Gonna slide on over to  
That funny little love that I've got  
Now we got it rolling,  
How're we gonna get it stopped  
Cause my momma's got something,  
Daddy needs more than a lot  
Now we got it rolling,  
How we gonna get it stopped

Softly she comes  
Whispers the breeze with her passing  
In secret love she is laughing  
Softly she comes in the night  
  
Softly she sighs  
Sweetly she lies never sleeping  
Her fragrance all in my keeping  
Softly she comes in the night  
  
Down the darkened hall  
I hear her footsteps on my stair  
And she is in my arms once more  
  
Then softly she goes  
Her shining lips in the shadows  
Whisper goodbye at my window  
Softly she goes in the dawn  
  
Down the darkened hall  
I hear her footsteps on my stair  
And she is in my arms once more  
  
Then softly she goes  
Her shining lips in the shadows  
Whisper goodbye at my window  
Softly she goes in the dawn  
Softly she goes in the dawn

Is there someone I can believe in?  
Is there somewhere I can hide?  
Take me out of the straits, I'm in  
Come and stay here by my side  
Somebody I can rely on  
I broke the law, I've been set free  
Give me something to decide upon  
Come and show yourself to me  
Is there someone sewing seams?  
Through all my hopes, through all my dreams  
You know, living a life of ease  
Don't make your meals taste better if you please  
Is there someone I can relate to?  
Who will break the ice for me?  
Take me out of the place I'm in  
Come and share yer life with me  
Somebody with nothing to live up to  
Who will mend my broken dreams?  
Give me a wave, I can ride upon  
Come and show yer strength to me  
I have felt the final rush of love's embrace  
The magic touch, running headlong to attract  
I felt the breath of Satan on my back  
Is there someone I can believe in?  
Is there something I can do?  
Take me out of the straits I'm in  
Let me show myself to you  
Somebody to whom I can belong  
Take my hand, I've been set free  
Give me some wings, I can glide upon  
Come and show yourself to me  
Is there someone sewings seams  
Through all my hopes, through all my dreams  
You know, living a life of ease  
Don't make yer meals taste better if you please  

She was something very special to me  
The kind of girl you'd like to see  
In a movie or a rosary  
  
She could be straight-laced or homespun  
Or free and easy on the run  
She could be meek and mild or full of fun  
  
She liked country lanes and aeroplanes  
And cigarettes would make her strange  
And when she wanted you she made it plain  
  
She would never say where she came from  
It didn't seem that she had anyone  
To answer to or dwell upon  
  
She liked candlelight and good wine  
And I would call her any time  
Of day or night she didn't mind  
  
The was nothing that I wouldn't do  
To prove to her my love was true  
And she gave to me a dream or two  
  
There were times when she would never appear  
For days and then she'd disappear  
But now the days have turned to years  
  
I was something she could use  
Like a good friend or a pair of shoes  
Or any kind of good news  
  
Now the eastern sky is crimson and red  
As I lie here in my lonely bed  
And think about the things she said  
  
She said darling there will come a day  
When I must run far away  
I will go my love and you must stay  
  
She departed in the early spring  
She didn't leave me anything  
To follow or to find her  
  
She was something very special to me  
The kind of girl you'd like to see  
In a movie or a rosary

Dreaming of a love I lost, the day the final bridge was crossed  
Sometimes I wish that I could just forget  
But the memory lingers yet and it hangs around  
Leaving me low and leaving me down  
Everywhere I roam, there is nobody home  
Even I should know, when it ain't my day there is no other way  
I begin to wake up, how wrong it was to cling to you  
Sometimes I wish to hold you in my heart  
'Cause I can't keep us apart, forgiving you  
Was the easiest thing that I ever could do  
Everywhere I go, there is no one I know  
Even I can see, it's too late now to believe in a vow  
As I wander I return, to days gone by there's much to be learned  
Sometimes I wish that miracles could be  
But at best I fail to see any happening  
Some gotta lose and some gotta win  
Everywhere I roam, there is nobody home  
Even I should know, when it ain't my day there is no other way  
Everywhere I go, there is no one I know  
Even I can see, it's too late now to believe in a vow  
You're leaving right now  

Out on the road like a low-down Joe  
And the bar where we are is so cool I'd like to stay  
Misunderstood like I knew I would be  
The one I care for don't mind, she's built that way  
I would gladly offer you my love  
In this hotel in Somewhere U.S.A.  
  
This rental car never went so far  
But with each passing mile on more dream has turned to clay  
Now that we've met and your eyes are all wet  
Let me fetch my guitar, there's a song I'd like to play  
I would gladly offer you my song  
In this hotel in Somewhere U.S.A.  
  
One never knows where the good times  
If you got some to spend,we'll do anything you say  
I'd never lie, well you know I've tried  
Though you think it's the drink that has made me behave this way  
I would gladly offer you my love  
In this hotel in Somewhere U.S.A

If you've got a heartache  
Of the kind that will not pass by  
Even if you don't see the end  
Of what lies around the bend  
Don't stay that way  
It's all in a day believe me  
Even the best of dreams must end  
Even so it grieves me  
Stay loose, don't fight it  
Let it take you all the way and  
If it's wrong, you will right it  
Do not waste these hours away  
How many times have I told you  
These are the tears I've shed  
Could it be that I need help  
Is it maybe I've come undone  
And one thing more  
You know it don't come easy  
Even the best of friends must part  
Even so it grieves me  
Stay loose, don't fight it  
Let love take a holiday  
If it's wrong, you're gonna right it  
Do not waste these hours away  
Soon the storm will be over  
And the clouds will all pass by  
To be insane beyond belief  
Is sometimes the best relief  
And one thing sure  
Love never did come easy  
Even the best of dreams must end  
Even so it grieves me  
Stay loose, don't fight it  
Let it take you all the way and  
If it's wrong, you will right it  
Do not waste these hours away  
Stay loose, don't fight it  
Let love take a holiday  
If it's wrong, you're gonna right it  
Do not waste these hours away

Well I got my mail late last night  
A letter from a girl who found the time to write  
To her lonesome boy somewheres in the night  
She sent me a railroad ticket too  
To take me to her lovin' arms  
And the big steel rail  
Gonna carry me home to the one I love  
  
Well I bin out here many a long days  
I haven't found a place that I could call my own  
Not a two bit bed to lay my body on  
I bin stood up I bin shook down  
I bin dragged into the sand  
And the big steel rail  
Gonna carry me home to the one I love  
  
Ooooh oooo oo whee hee hee  
Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo oo  
  
Well I bin up tight most every night  
Walkin' along the streets of this old town  
Not a friend to tell my troubles to  
My good old car she done broke down  
'Cause I drove it into the ground  
And the big steel rail  
Gonna carry me home to the one I love  
  
Well I look over yonder across the plain  
The big drive wheels are poundin' along the ground  
Gonna get on board and I'll be homeward bound  
Now I ain't had a home cooked meal  
And Lord I need one now  
And the big steel rail  
Gonna carry me home to the one I love  
  
Ooooh oooo oo whee hee hee  
Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo oo  
  
Now here I am with my head in the sand  
Standin' on the broad highway would you give a ride  
To a lonesome boy who missed the train last night  
I went in town for one last round  
And I gambled my ticket away  
And the big steel rail  
Won't carry me home to the one I love

If you really knew how many times I've tried to help you  
Make your mind up in the matters of the heart, you'd not be bothered  
By the miscues or the bad trips that seem to come and plague us  
Having thought it over, I sure would like to talk to you again  
  
I was stone cold sober, it was daylight in October  
When you reached across the table put your hand upon my shoulder  
And my lips were warm with kissing while we found the missing pieces  
To all the empty spaces I sure would like to talk that way again  
  
We have soared above the clouds, we've heard the angels breathing  
While we made love in the morning, there was never talk of leaving  
We would lie that way for hours with our arms around each other  
It was all so easy, I sure would like to talk to you again  
  
'Cause I'm stone cold sober, the daylight has crossed over  
In the night, a touch of sadness  
We had it coming, had it going way back then  
  
I was stone cold sober when I woke the morning after  
Having shattered the illusions of the object of my passions  
With a will made out of iron and a mind that is her own  
Having thought it over, I sure would like to talk to her again  
We had it coming, had it going way back then  
  
I hope that we can see each other often  
That our points of view will blend into each other,  
Like the sea and the horizon  
And the sun will shine upon us as we live our lives forever  
Having thought it over, I sure would like to talk to you again

Where the road runs down but the butternut grove  
To old Bill Skinner's stream  
Do tell at the noonday bell  
It's time for a summertime dream  
In a lunch pail town in a one horse way  
You can live like a king and queen  
Let's steal away in the noonday sun  
It's time for a summertime dream  
  
Birds in all creation will be twitterin' in the trees  
And down below's a pond I know  
You can swim in it if you please  
And if you come 'round when the mill shuts down  
You can see what chivalry means  
Let's steal away in the noonday sun  
It's time for a summertime dream  
  
On a trip on down to wonderland  
In love among the flowers  
Where time gets lost with no straw boss  
Tallyin' up the hours  
Where the road runs down by the butternut grove  
To old Bill Skinner's stream  
Do tell at the noonday bell  
It's time for a summertime dream  
  
Birds in all creation will be twitterin' in the trees  
And down below's a pond I know  
You can swim in it if you please  
And if you come 'round when the mill shuts down  
You can see what chivalry means  
Let's steal away in the noonday sun  
It's time for a summertime dream

I can see her lyin' back in her satin dress  
In a room where ya do what ya don't confess  
Sundown ya better take care  
If I find you bin creepin' 'round my back stairs  
Sundown ya better take care  
If I find you bin creepin' 'round my back stairs  
  
She's bin lookin' like a queen in a sailor's dream  
And she don't always say what she really means  
Sometimes I think it's a shame  
When I get feelin' better when I'm feelin' no pain  
Sometimes I think it's a shame  
When I get feelin' better when I'm feelin' no pain  
  
I can picture every move that a man could make  
Getting lost in her lovin' is your first mistake  
Sundown ya better take care  
If I find you bin creepin' 'round my back stairs  
Sometimes I think it's a sin  
When I feel like I'm winnin' when I'm losin' again  
  
I can see her lookin' fast in her faded jeans  
She's a hard lovin' woman, got me feelin' mean  
Sometimes I think it's a shame  
When I get feelin' better when I'm feelin' no pain  
Sundown ya better take care  
If I find you bin creepin' 'round my back stairs  
Sundown ya better take care  
If I find you bin creepin' 'round my back stairs  
Sometimes I think it's a sin  
When I feel like I'm winnin' when I'm losin' again

[Chorus]  
I heard you talking in your sleep  
Is there anything that I can do  
I don't believe we've had a word all day  
Bout anything at all  
  
I heard you talking in the night  
That's right, yes I heard ya call  
Though I could hardly hear the name you spoke  
It's a name I don't recall  
I heard you softly whisper  
I reached out to hold you near me  
Then from your lips there came that secret  
I was not supposed to know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I heard you talking in the night  
That's right, yes I heard ya call  
Though I could hardly hear the name you spoke  
It's a name I don't recall  
  
[Chorus]

Thank you for the promises we make  
I know I can't complain  
I think I did all right  
No failures are in sight  
Only now and then  
I'd like to reminisce  
Do you remember when  
  
Even if we're angels we can't ask  
To wander through the past  
The future is our goal  
The night is black as coal  
If I could pay the price  
I'd like to love you once  
I'd love to love you twice  
  
Thanks  
We cannot say enough  
The road is sometimes rough  
But we can get along  
The going will get tough  
But we won't be afraid  
Of the promises we made  
  
Thank you for the promises you keep  
When I am fast asleep  
To be where we belong  
Is all that I can ask  
We can do it in the shade  
As long as I have you  
And the promises we made  
  
Thank you for the promises we break  
If you made a clean mistake  
Well that's what love's about  
No need to stand and shout  
The truth is in your eyes  
The answer lies within  
No need to criticize  
  
Thanks  
For the promises at hand  
The abuse that we must stand  
Is often heaven sent  
They may not pay the rent  
You never can be sure  
When promises get bent  
  
Thank you for the promises that live  
This is all that I can give  
Forever in my mind  
To leave the past behind  
And seal it with a kiss  
Forever in my soul  
I will remember this

I come to this garden, I come here to rest  
Early each day upon rising  
I think of my lost love from over the sea  
And sometimes I've wondered, if she thinks of me  
I long to recall every kiss, every kind word  
I miss her so much I could die  
But the creatures of evil have captured her heart  
And that same old obsession still keeps us apart  
There's peace in the garden, there's peace in the air  
Peace in the sound of the river  
There's peace in the meadow, the sun shines like gold  
And if she were with me there'd be peace in my soul  
I long to return to the place I remember  
The taste of her lips close to mine  
I could do much better if I could be strong  
Come into my garden but leave me alone  
I come to this garden, I come here to rest  
Just as the night comes stealing  
Someone is weeping, I'm calling her name  
Deep in the garden, deep in my brain  
I long to recall every kiss, every kind word  
I miss her so much I could die  
But the creatures of evil have captured her heart  
And that same old obsession still keeps us apart  
But the creatures of evil have captured her heart  
And that same old obsession still keeps us apart  

The first time ever I saw your face  
I thought the sun rose in your eyes  
And the moon and the stars were the gifts you gave  
To the night and the empty skies my love  
To the night and the empty skies  
  
The first time ever I kissed your mouth  
I felt the earth turn in my hand  
Like the trembling heart of a captive bird  
That was there at my command my love  
That was there at my command  
  
The first time ever I lay with you  
And felt your heart beat close to mine  
I thought our joy would fill the earth  
And would last 'till the end of time my love  
And would last 'till the end of time  
  
The first time ever I saw your face  
I thought the sun rose in your eyes  
And the moon and the stars were the gifts you gave  
To the night and the empty skies my love  
To the night and the empty skies

Step inside my tent, said she, "I'd like to read you palm"  
Leave the dollar in the jar, this won't take very long  
Leave the circus noise behind, close your eyes, relax your mind  
I'll tell you, if you should quit now or if you should go on  
Then I said, "Now what do ya see?"  
She said, "Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dee"  
Where'll I go, what'll I be?  
She said, "Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dee"  
She threw some sawdust in the air and her hands began to shake  
She told me, the town where I was born, she almost knew the date  
She lit a candle with her eyes and then she made the table rise  
She took the dollar from the jar and then she guessed my weight  
Then I said, "Now what do ya see?"  
She said, "Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dee"  
You are so old, you are so wise  
Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dy  
Give me a sign, tell it to me  
She said, "Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dee"  
Then she spoke most quietly  
Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dee  
When you we a child at school they taught you quite a lot  
You were told when you should speak and when you should not  
You were taught to read and write, to take your lessons home at night  
A little knowledge serves you well but the golden rule does not  
Then I said, "Now what do ya see?"  
She said, "Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dee"  
Where'll I go, what'll I be?  
She said, "Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dee"  
Then when I came home that night to lie in bed awake  
I thought of that old gypsy and the words that she had said  
And now I see with due respect, the more we learn the worse we get  
So if you feel you've no regrets, go have your fortune read  
Then I said, "Now what do ya see?"  
She said, "Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dee"  
You are so old, you are so wise  
Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dy  
Give me a sign, tell it to me  
She said, "Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dee"  
Then she spoke most quietly  
Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dee  
Where'll I go, what'll I be  
She said, "Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dee"  
You are so old, you are so wise  
Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dy  
Give me a sign, tell it to me  
She said, "Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dee"
