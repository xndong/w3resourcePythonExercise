A burst of speed is all I need to set me free  
A flagging start that stirs the heart to ecstasy  
Raging away I'll go far  
Time waits for no man  
So reach for the stars  
I'm fired up  
All fired up  
Fired up  
All fired up  
A bolt of light that sears the night of things supreme  
To chase the sun, forever on and live the dream  
Forcing a system aside  
Too fast for this life  
My mind's open wide  
I'm fired up  
All fired up  
Fired up  
All fired up  
I'm soaring, free falling  
With all emotions roaring  
Like lighting, like thunder  
I'll rip the world as under  
Let's go, hold on  
I'm soaring, free falling  
With all emotions roaring  
Like lighting, like thunder  
I'll rip the world as under  
Raging away I'll go far  
Time waits for no man  
So reach for the stars  
I'm fired up  
All fired up  
Fired up  
All fired up  
Fired up  
All fired up  
Fired up  
All fired up  
All fired up  

Alright baby. You know how to have a good time don't cha  
It's the way you stand  
You're always attracting attention  
  
Now with your hands on your hips, and a  
Snarl on your lips  
Your eyes wore the look of danger  
There's a lion in your heart,  
  
That's set to quick start,  
  
To a glance from any stranger  
You give as good as you get  
No one's beat you yet  
You take the lead  
You never need  
You know all the moves you've got to make  
  
You take it all, you take it all the way  
  
Ya never do things by half  
You're a man with a reputation  
You never shy when the problems fly  
You can cope with any situation  
You take the wheel and crack the whip  
You never slip  
You rule the roost  
You always boast  
Yeah you're lookin' after number one  
  
You take it all, you take it all the way  

They say we are fools  
We say look at you  
Long ago  
We were just a few  
Still say we don't need you  
  
[Chorus]  
We don't wanna belong  
We said all along  
We just wanna be, left alone  
We don't wanna belong  
We said all along  
We just wanna be, left alone  
  
Think that we must have lost our way  
Running form the blaze  
You were wrong  
We chose our course  
Counted up the days  
Enduring in a rage  
We got strong  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You denied everything that's good  
Reacting as you would  
With your shame  
So we turned  
And left you all behind  
We don't need your kind  
You're to blame  
  
[Chorus]  
  
In years to come  
You'll hear my name  
When darkness falls  
On Judgment Day  
  
They say we are fools  
We say look at you  
Long ago we were just a few  
Still say, we don't need you  
  
Think we have lost our way  
Running form the blaze  
You were wrong  
We chose our course  
Counted up the days  
Enduring in a rage  
We got strong  
  
[Chorus: x2]

Before the dawn, I hear you whisper  
In your sleep "Don't let the morning take him"  
Outside the birds begin to call  
As if to summon up my leaving  
  
It's been a lifetime since I found someone  
Since I found someone who would stay  
I've waited too long, and now you're leaving  
Oh please don't take it all away  
  
It's been a lifetime since I found someone  
Since I found someone who would stay  
I've waited too long, and now you're leaving  
Oh please don't take it all away  
  
Before the dawn, I hear you whisper  
In your sleep "Don't let the morning take him"  

You could find a way to ease my passion  
You listen to the blood flow in my veins  
You hear the teaching of the wind  
Tell her why I'm alive within  
I can't find the words  
My mind is dead  
It's better by you better than me  
  
Guess you'll have to tell her how I tried  
To speak up thoughts I've held so inside  
Tell her now I got to go  
Out in the streets and down the shore  
Tell her the world's not much living for  
It's better by you better than me  
  
Everybody  
Everybody knows  
Everybody  
Everybody knows  
Better by you better than me  
  
You can tell what I want it to be  
You can say what I only can see  
It's better by you better than me  
  
Guess I'll have to change my way of living  
Don't wanna really know the way I feel  
Guess I'll learn to fight and kill  
Tell her not to wait until  
They'll find my blood upon her windowsill  
It's better by you better than me  
  
Everybody  
Everybody knows  
Everybody  
Everybody knows  
Better by you better than me  
  
You can say what I only can see  
You can tell what I want it to be  
  
It's better by you better than me  
  
Better by you better than me  
  
You can tell what I want it to be  
You can say way all they can see  
  
Better by you better than me

Storm warning  
But there's no fear  
Lies forming  
The sacrament lays bare  
The sinner  
Will testify  
They'll suffer  
When sacrificed on high  
The burning sermons purge their evil words  
Between the Hammer and the Anvil  
Force rises  
False rituals  
Baptises  
The body and the soul  
Our union  
Their fall from grace  
Confession (confess your sins)  
Will seal them to their fate  
The burning sermons will survive their curse  
Between the Hammer and the Anvil  
Transgression  
They prey on grief  
Our mission  
To purify belief  
This altar  
Gives power and light  
They'll falter  
While we are shining bright  
The burning sermons consecrate their sin  
Between the Hammer and the Anvil  
Storm warning  
But there's no fear

As the sun goes down, I move around  
Keeping to the shadows  
Life, hangs by a thread  
And I've heard it said, that I'll not see tomorrow  
  
If that's my destiny, it'll have to be  
So I'll face the future  
Running out of time  
I'm on the line  
But I'll go down fighting  
  
Felt the hand of justice  
Telling wrong from right  
Threw me out upon the street in the middle of the night  
  
Cybernetic heartbeat  
Digital precise  
Pneumatic fingers nearly had me in their vice  
  
Not begging you  
I'm telling you  
  
You won't break me  
You won't make me  
You won't take me  
Under blood red skies  
  
You won't break me  
You won't take me  
I'll fight you under  
Blood red skies  
  
Through a shattered city, watched by laser eyes  
Overhead the night squad glides  
The decaying paradise  
  
Automatic sniper  
With computer sights  
Scans the bleak horizon for its victim of the night  
  
They're closing in  
They'll never win  
  
You won't break me  
You won't make me  
You won't take me  
Under blood red skies  
  
You won't break me  
You won't take me  
I'll fight you under  
Blood red skies  
  
As the end is drawing near  
Standing proud, I won't give in to fear  
As I die a legend will be born  
I will stand. I will fight  
You'll never take me alive  
  
I'll stand my ground  
I won't go down  
  
You won't break me  
You won't make me  
You won't take me,  
Under blood red skies  
  
You won't break me  
You won't take me  
I'll fight you under  
Blood red skies  
  
You'll never take me alive  
I'm telling you  
Hands of justice  
I will stand, I will fight  
As the sun goes down  
I won't give in to fear

I've been trying  
There's no denying.  
It's sending me  
Out of my mind.  
  
I've seen reason  
Change to treason.  
It's losing its sense  
Of all kind.  
  
How much longer will it take  
For the world to see.  
We should learn to live  
And simply let it be.  
Bloodstone, bloodstone.  
  
In the night time  
Wake in fright.  
I'm so scared of the game  
That's being played.  
Start to wonder  
What's going under.  
And how many deals  
Have been made.  
  
Bloodstone.  
I can't take it.  
You got me living  
On a bloodstone  
I don't want that bloodstone  

Turn me off  
Pull the plug  
Leave me with some dignity  
I am not  
What I was  
And I don't need the sympathy  
  
Alive inside me  
No one can hear me  
  
Brain dead  
I'm not  
Brain dead  
Sentenced  
Forgot  
  
Paralyzed  
In my shell  
Enduring every  
Endless day  
  
Immobilized  
On my back  
Aware of everything  
They say  
  
Extricate me  
Eliminate me  
  
Brain dead  
I'm not  
Brain dead  
Drip fed  
Forgot  
  
I can't blink my eye or cry  
Or even speak  
They crowd around my bed  
Condescending words are said  
Thinking I don't hear or know  
What is going on?  
Hello  
Can't you suckers hear my cries  
From inside? I'm still alive  
It's my decision to abort  
Turn off the goddamn life support  
  
Let me pass  
From this world  
So I fade away in peace  
  
Comprehending  
Unrelenting  
  
Brain dead  
I'm not  
Brain dead  
Sentenced  
Forgot  
  
Brain dead  
I'm not  
Brain dead  
Drip fed  
Forgot

[Verse 1]  
There I was completely wasting  
Out of work and down  
All inside, it's so frustrating  
As I drift from town to town  
Feel as though nobody cares  
If I live or die  
So I might as well begin  
To put some action in my life!  
  
[Chorus]  
Breaking the law, breaking the law  
Breaking the law, breaking the law  
Breaking the law, breaking the law  
Breaking the law, breaking the law  
  
[Verse 2]  
So much for the golden future  
I can't even start  
I've had every promise broken  
There's anger in my heart  
You don't know what it's like  
You don't have a clue  
If you did you'd find yourselves  
Doing the same thing too!  
  
[Chorus]  
Breaking the law, breaking the law  
Breaking the law, breaking the law  
Breaking the law, breaking the law  
Breaking the law, breaking the law  
  
[Bridge guitar solo 1]  
You don't know what it's like!  
(Sirens blare)  
  
[Bridge guitar solo 2]  
  
[Chorus x2]  
Breaking the law, breaking the law  
Breaking the law, breaking the law  
Breaking the law, breaking the law  
Breaking the law, breaking the law

Speak to me  
Of those days I won't forget  
Your worst dreams  
Has just returned, to pay you back  
I'm still laughing  
There's not much else I can do  
But one's thing's certain  
I'm coming back for you  
  
Have you got a gun  
Do you remember well  
Who you used it on  
It's time to burn in Hell  
  
Say my name  
I can hear you whisper  
Not to blame?  
You are going to blister  
Scream in the night  
I've been counting the days  
It's so amusing  
To see you again  
  
Have you got a gun  
Do you remember well  
Who d'ya use it on  
You're going to burn in Hell  
  
Die  
Why?  
Time to pay the price  
Kill  
I will  
Have my sacrifice  
  
Plead  
With fear  
I am getting near  
Friend  
Liar  
Time to eat some fire  
  
Have you got a gun  
Do you remember well  
Who d'ya use it on  
You're going to burn in Hell  
  
Burn in Hell  
I can hear you whisper  
Burn in Hell  
You are going to blister  
  
Have you got a gun  
Do you remember well  
Who d'ya use it on  
You're going to burn in Hell  
  
Burn in Hell  
I can hear you whisper  
Burn in Hell  
You are going to blister  
  
Snarl like a dog  
You'll scream like a banshee  
Stuck like a hog  
You're gonna love me  
  
Burn in Hell  
I can hear you whisper  
Burn in Hell  
You are going to blister  
Burn in Hell  
Screaming like a banshee  
Burn in Hell  
Burn

You stitch me up good, and you cut me down  
So I string you up to keep you hanging around  
You dish the hot stuff up but you keep me waiting  
So I'll play it dirty 'til your body is breaking  
  
We've got to make love, the time is right  
We've got to make love tonight  
'Cause we're burnin' up  
  
You make me greedy, you won't feed me my food  
But I'll make out easy, 'cause I see straight through you  
You cool me off and hot me up and that's not right  
'Cause you'll get hungry in the heat of the night  
  
And then we'll make love, just when it's right  
And when we make love tonight  
We'll be burnin' up  
  
I know you feel the same  
I know you feel the flame  
Staring deep inside of you  
Burnin' you up, breaking you down  
Breakin' you out in a cold sweat  
And as you lose control, of your very soul  
Your desire takes over  
You'll feel the heat sway  
You're round to my way  
And suddenly you'll know that you're burnin' up  
  
You stitch me up good, and you cut me down  
So I string you up to keep you hanging around  
You dish the hot stuff up but you keep me waiting  
So I'll play it dirty 'til your body is breaking  
  
We've got to make love, the time is right  
We've got to make love tonight  
'Cause we're burnin' up  
We're burnin' up

They have blown away the daylight hours we had  
Left a legacy, a deadly aftermath  
We cannot exist in godforsaken lands  
As we spiral down into oblivion  
Breathing the fumes of fires that they ignite  
Losing ground and we are all just losing sight  
We shall never see another setting sun  
Time to rise up and ascend, the end has come  
  
No more willpower  
Choked by hell fire  
Darkness above  
Blackening out the sun  
Gripped by steel claws  
Corrosion eating us  
  
So before we're all devoured  
Time to rise up and retire  
In cathedral spires  
Watching as the world expires  
From up amongst the clouds  
In cathedral spires  
  
No names  
No graves  
No prayers  
Can save us  
  
Ashes to dust  
Doomsday's upon us now  
  
It cannot be stopped  
Genocide all is lost  
  
Oh! We're so tired  
Time to rise up and conspire  
In cathedral spires  
Watching as our world expires  
From up above the clouds  
In cathedral spires  
  
Jaws of corruption  
Swallow us as one  
Consuming every nation  
Evoke resistance getting none  
Complete disintegration  
No good to defend  
There can be but one outcome  
We are no more - ascend  
  
Vaporized fury  
Offers no sanctuary  
  
Oh! We're so tired  
Time to rise up and retire  
In cathedral spires  
Watching as the world expires  
From up amongst the clouds  
In cathedral  
In cathedral spires  
  
Oh! We're so tired  
Watching the world expire  
Time that we retire  
Up in cathedral spires  
  
Oh! We're so tired  
Watching the world expire  
Time that we retire  
Up in cathedral spires  
  
Oh! We're so tired  
Watching the world expire  
Time that we retire  
Up in cathedral spires  
  
Oh! We're so tired  
Watching the world expire  
Time that we retire  
Up in cathedral spires

Up into an endless state of time  
With nothing good or bad just one  
We have been strangers for a very long time  
We have watched and we have tried  
And now I need this  
Know this taste this want this...  
So swell the black sails with wind  
And let me reap my rewards and start again  
This is the line that will fall  
Now that there's nothing left  
That can shut you down  
It doesn't take much to break  
A life beyond the things you live for  
Into a place where you have all that it takes  
We have watched and we have tried  
And now I need this  
Know this taste this want this...  
So swell the black sails with wind  
And let me reap my rewards and start again  
Swell the black sails with wind  
And let me reap my rewards and start again  
This is the line that will fall  
Now that there's nothing left  
That can shut you down  
You will reap just what you sow  
You will reap just what you sow  
You will reap just what you sow  
You will reap just what you sow  
So swell the black sails with wind  
And let me reap my rewards and start again  
So swell the black sails with wind  
And let me reap my rewards and start again  
And let me reap my rewards and start again  
Let me reap my rewards and start again  
Let me reap my rewards and start again  
Let me reap my rewards and start again

I got home late this evening, stumbled up the stair  
I couldn't believe my eyes when I looked in the bedroom there  
My woman with a man was lyin' fast asleep  
I felt a rage inside me, control I couldn't keep  
  
She was a cheater  
  
I reached the dressing table, kicked away the door  
I gripped the cold black metal, a loaded .44  
By this time they're awake and they don't know what to do  
I scream you cheatin' bitch here's what I think of you  
  
You are a cheater  
  
They both pleaded for mercy, I said no way  
When you do this upon me, you have no say  
I treated you so real good, and this is what you do  
Oh no I've finished with you, your time is through  
  
You are a cheater  
  
If you need a cheater there's nobody sweeter than this one  
There's no neater, come on here and meet her  
Cheater, cheater, cheater, come on and meet her

So many years that we were one  
So many things we've done  
The memories alive  
But most of me has died  
  
As I struggle with events  
I'm offered words of strength  
They do not comprehend  
The passion we possessed  
  
People tell me what to do  
Tell me how I should get through  
But they haven't got a clue  
No one else comes close to you  
  
I see your eyes before they closed  
They looked right inside my soul  
And they asked me not to grieve  
I tried but still I bleed  
  
I wake up, I break up  
Try hard to shake off  
The desolation as it grows  
As nothing else comes close  
  
And as I stand here by the grave  
And the wind calls out your name  
I know that time could never heal  
The emptiness I feel  
  
People try to give me hope  
Tell me how I should let go  
But they'll never really know  
'Cause there's nothing else comes close  
  
People tell me what to do  
Tell me how I should get through  
But they haven't got a clue  
No one else comes close to you

[Verse:]  
I have no face, I have no mind  
I have no senses left, you see I'm blind  
I feel no faith, I hear no truth  
The reason is I have, have uncome loose  
  
[Chorus:]  
There is no way I have no voice  
I have no say, I have no choice  
I feel no pain, or suffering  
It's just cold blood that runs through me  
  
[Verse:]  
I lay here numb, my conscience clear  
And all the dissesncy transfused to fear  
I feel no faith, I hear no truth  
The reason is I have, have uncome loose  
  
[Chorus:]  
There is no way I have no voice  
I have no say, I have no choice  
I feel no pain, or suffering  
It's just cold blood that runs through me  
  
[Bridge:]  
You suck my life and all I live for  
I left fortune cold logging envy here  
  
[Chorus:]  
There is no way I have no voice  
I have no say, I have no choice  
I feel no pain, or suffering  
It's just cold blood that runs through me

The night of reckoning  
The days of old  
His might is menacing  
Sword and shield made of gold  
  
[Chorus]  
Conquest and fire  
The age of desire  
When man will be free once more  
Like rays from the sun  
That heal everyone  
Living for evermore  
  
Bow down in reverence  
Keep faith be true  
Give thanks for armistice  
Be brave he'll come through  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Conquest and fire  
We will be strong  
Days of desire  
Making us stronger  
  
Revenge and reckoning  
Beware of this god  
His might is menacing  
Shield made of gold  
  
Sword and shield of gold  
The mighty stand alone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Conquest and fire  
We will be strong  
Days of desire  
Making us stronger  
  
Conquest attest  
Stands triumphant  
Heaven sent, be vigilant  
Don't relinquish

He lies in wait  
For one mistake  
Morphing on your screen  
  
Those who dare  
Or the unaware  
Download him for a scream  
  
Don't access the site  
Or beware his megabyte  
  
No virus scan  
Detects the man  
Or the deadly tasks he plans  
  
Drooling lips  
His circuits lit  
He crouches for attack  
  
Spider like on the web  
Alive and well  
But you are dead  
Iniquitous in every way  
Now he's come out to play  
  
Cyberface  
Iron will  
Programmed to corrupt and kill  
Cyberface  
No escape  
He is interfaced to Hell  
  
Once he's summoned and installed Cyberface  
He'll infest your motherboard Cyberface  
  
Now he's got a grip  
He will strip away your flesh  
Alive yet dead  
A fiend obsessed  
He'll crash your system down  
Once in place  
He'll simulate  
Your life it's worthless now  
  
God forsaken  
Grotesque mind  
An entity  
That's come alive  
Boot your screen  
And suddenly  
Approaching fast and mean  
  
Once he's summoned and installed Cyberface  
He'll infest your motherboard Cyberface

The hangman's noose won't get me  
Gas chambers never stress me  
The can line me up against the wall  
  
No firing squad will make me  
Confess or even break me  
I'll stand alone or not at all  
I will not obey  
I will not betray  
I will not give in  
Not while I'm living  
  
No surrender  
We never will surrender  
  
We are all dead meat  
Cut us, watch us bleed  
  
No shackles made will chain me  
No endless pain will change me  
The scars will testify this all  
  
No solitary confinement  
Will break my strong resignment  
I'll die before I will conform  
I will not obey  
I will not betray  
I will not give in  
Not while I'm living  
  
No surrender  
There'll never be surrender  
  
We are all dead meat  
Cut us, watch us bleed  
  
Read in my obituary  
Defiance breeds victory  
  
No cage they make can hold me  
No law enforced controls me  
No trap that's sprung stops me for long  
No prison cell contains me  
No snare they set will claim me  
Relentlessly I'll fight them all  
  
I will not obey  
I will not betray  
I will not give in  
Not while I'm living  
  
No surrender  
We never will  
Be driven asunder  
No surrender  
We never will  
Raise the white flag  
  
We are all dead meat  
Cut us, watch us bleed  
We are all dead meat  
Cut us, watch us bleed  
  
Indoctrination  
Will never  
Suppress me  
They're seriously mistaken  
'Cause I'll take them  
Down with me  
And just before they're finished  
They'll scream along with me  
We are all dead meat

Forged in the Black Country  
Under blood red skies  
We all had our dream to realize  
Driving in that transit  
Down to Holy Joe's  
Used to lose our head while metal flowed  
Nothing held us back or dared to try  
Something in our blood won't let us die  
We built our world of metal watched it grow  
Fueled the fury solid to the bone  
  
Gotta deal with the devil  
'Cause you know that's it's real  
Done a deal with the devil  
From a heart made of steel  
  
Rollin' down the M-Way  
Took it to the smoke  
Banging heads there 'til we all went broke  
When we don the leather  
And the whips and chains  
Nothing matters more, we can't be tamed  
Fighting through the din and accolades  
Turn the phase around with razor blades  
Watched the movement grow into one voice  
Took on the whole world it had no choice  
  
Late at night  
You're in our sight  
Where we can feel what we've been waiting for  
Let me hear you roar  
On this stage, let it rage  
For a time we leave the world behind  
To be with our own kind

I will take your final breath  
And I will be your last regret  
  
Cold blood, runs in my blackened heart  
Tearing, every soul apart  
  
[Chorus]  
Messenger of death, wields the scythe  
Of man's damnation  
Messenger of death, hold his blade  
For termination  
  
Sin, is what I feast upon  
I'm forging my crematorium  
Your tomb, is waiting here for you  
Welcome to my ritual  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Death rides out from the storm  
We turn to God and cry  
Ignored we turn to face  
This vengeance from the sky  
  
Death rides out from the storm  
No time left to repent  
No quarter, no escape  
No line of self defense  
  
Death rides out from the storm  
In terror we confess  
Our voice is heard no more  
His deed is merciless  
  
Death rides out from the storm  
Deface humanity  
There's no escape from this  
Human calamity  
  
Death rides out from the storm  
We turn to God and cry  
Ignored we turn to face  
This vengeance from the sky  
  
[Chorus]

Your head  
You will lose it  
Severed  
When executed  
  
You always thought  
You'd never get caught  
  
Decapitate  
Sealing your fate  
  
Rebels  
Futile efforts  
Are quelled  
With effective measures  
  
The sentence is read  
Word that you dread  
  
Decapitate  
Walk through Hell's gate  
  
You've lost your head sir  
Well you will tomorrow - sleep well  
  
This court's  
Best deterrent  
To set  
New precendents  
  
The verdict of course  
Couldn't be worse  
  
Decapitate  
Example be made  
  
Decapitate  
Will seal your fate

Feeling like we're, ready to kick tonight  
No hesitating, my bodies aching  
Looking for some action, satisfaction all right  
Charging, vein faced, as active as one-hundred solid proof  
Megaton, Leviathan, we're ready to hit the roof  
  
You better watch out and hold on tight  
We're heading your way like dynamite  
Uh, Delivering the goods  
Uh, Delivering the goods  
  
Shake down, rock 'em boys, crack that whip strap mean  
Pulse rate, air waves, battle lies in every place we've been  
Stealing your hearts all across the land  
Hot blood doing good, we're going to load you with our brand  
  
You better watch out and hold on tight  
We're heading your way like dynamite  
Uh, Delivering the goods  
Yeah, Delivering the goods  
  
Have it your way  
Stealing your hearts  
  
Well we don't pull no punches, we aim where the crunch is  
Bound to do most damage to your brain  
If you're looking for it mellow  
you're nothing more than yellow  
Gonna do it again and again  
We'll beat you to submission  
So you might as well surrender  
You gotta learn your lesson  
'Cause there ain't nobody here to defend your heart  
  
Faster, higher  
'Til it seems that we're gonna break  
Oh shootin' further, giving more than you're ever gonna take  
Leaving your heads  
Crushed out on the floor  
Begging for mercy  
Be careful or we'll do it some more  
  
You better watch out and hold on tight  
We're heading your way like dynamite  
Uh, Delivering the goods  
Uh, Delivering the goods

Born of the sun  
Crashed to the earth  
Tormented reviled  
Engorged hate from birth  
Hellion's the steed  
Blood's on the wing  
Claws set to slice  
Vengeance he'll bring  
  
Cremating the land  
In seek and destroy  
Apocalypse slays  
Napalm he'll deploy  
The beast of a god  
Regaled of his race  
Prepare to onslaught  
And bare face to face  
Across the divide  
The thresholds in flames  
The Painkiller rises again  
  
The scream of the demon  
There's evil about  
They've come to posses us  
Out, demons out  
  
Blade of the wheel  
Cuts deep in the bone  
It's Gideon's quest  
To take Satan's throne  
  
The critical mass  
And power that they wield  
Exterminates all  
When vermin rebel  
A maelstrom begins to disintegrate  
And pulverize all in it's wake  
  
Demonizer  
Out, out, out, demons out

Full moon is rising  
The sky is black  
I heed your call I'm coming back  
The road is straight cast  
Wind's in my eyes  
The engine roars between my thighs  
  
From desert plains I bring you love  
From desert plains I bring you love  
  
Wild mountain thunder  
Echoes my quest  
My body aches but I'll not rest  
Quartz light to guide me  
Till sunrise leads  
My passion screams, my heart it bleeds  
  
From desert plains I bring you love  
From desert plains I bring you love  
  
Then in the distance  
I see you stand  
On the horizon you raise your hand  
In burning rubber  
I end my quest  
You fall into my arms and rest  
  
From desert plains I bring you love  
From desert plains I bring you love

Hypnotize me  
Mesmerize me  
Feel my willpower slip  
Light my fire  
With cold desire  
Losing all my grip  
  
Eat my diamonds  
Drinking all my gin  
Feast your eyes on  
A whole lotta sin  
  
Oh no you're so damned wicked  
You got me by the throat  
Oh no gotcha claws stuck in me  
You never let me go  
I believe you're the devil  
I believe you're the devil's child  
  
Took my dreams  
And now it's seems you're nothing but a liar  
Smash and grab at all I had  
Build my funeral pyre  
Stop pretendin'  
Got me growin' old  
Your tormentin's  
Fit to snap my soul  
  
Oh no you're so damned wicked  
You got me by the throat  
Oh no gotcha claws stuck in me  
You never let me go  
I believe you're the devil  
I believe you're the devil's child  
  
You took my heart  
And left it blown to smithereens  
I gave my body as a slave  
You cut my flesh  
And drank my blood that poured in streams  
I'm left here broken and ashamed  
  
Goin' under  
Hear the thunder  
Death defying grace  
Your condition breeds ammunition  
Shoots me in the face  
Vicious talkin'  
Stabs me like a knife  
Scratched and bruised, so abused  
I'm a human sacrifice  
  
Oh no you're so damned wicked  
You got me by the throat  
Oh no gotcha claws stuck in me  
You never let me go  
I believe you're the devil  
I believe you're the devil's child

I'll be damned, here comes your ghost again  
But that's not unusual  
It's just that the moon is full  
And you decided to call  
  
And here I sit, hand on the telephone  
Hearing the voice I'd known  
A couple of light years ago  
Headed straight for a fall  
  
But we both know what memories can bring  
They bring diamonds and rust  
Yes we both know what memories can bring  
They bring diamonds and rust  
  
Now I see you standing with brown leaves all around and snow in your hair  
Now we're smiling out the window of the crummy hotel over Washington Square  
Our breath comes in white clouds, mingles and hangs in the air  
Speaking strictly for me we both could've died then and there  
  
Now you're telling me you're not nostalgic  
Then give me another word for it  
You were so good with words  
And at keeping things vague  
  
Cause I need some of that vagueness now  
It's all come back too clearly, yes, I love you dearly  
And if you're offering me diamonds and rust, I've already paid  
  
But we both know what memories can bring  
They bring diamonds and rust  
Yes we both know what memories can bring  
They bring diamonds and rust  
  
Diamonds, diamonds and rust  
Diamonds, diamonds and rust  
Diamonds, diamonds and rust  
Diamonds, diamonds and rust

Grand canyons of space and time universal  
My mind is subjected to all  
  
Stab! Bawl! Punch! Crawl!  
Hooks to my brain are well in  
Stab! Bawl! Punch! Crawl!  
I know what I am, I'm Berlin  
  
Through cracked, blackened memories of unit dispersal  
I face the impregnable wall  
  
Stab! Bawl! Punch! Crawl!  
Hooks to my brain are well in  
Stab! Bawl! Punch! Crawl!  
I know what I am, I'm Berlin  
  
Exploding, reloading, this quest never ending  
Until I give out my last breath  
  
I'm stabbing and bawling, I'm punching and crawling  
Hooks to my brain are well in  
I'm stabbing and bawling, I'm punching and crawling  
I know what I am, I'm Berlin  

Come on, come on now what you say  
Somebody say you leave today  
What's this thing you're doin' to me  
What's this fool you're tryin' to be  
You're talkin' nothin' but a load of guff  
You're tryin' to put somethin' in my lap, lap  
  
Don't go. Please don't leave me  
Don't go in the mornin'  
Don't go. Please don't deceive me  
Don't take it away  
  
I do, I do anything for you  
You make my stormy clouds blue  
Inside out, I'm upside down  
Back to front I'm all around  
Don't cha leave me by myself  
I don't like it  
  
Don't go. Please don't leave me  
Don't go in the mornin'  
Don't go. Please don't deceive me  
Don't take it away

I've had enough of being programmed  
And told what I ought to do  
Let's get one thing straight  
I'll choose my fate  
And it's got nothing to do with you  
  
The years are flying by and it's time I got high  
Took a sample of the good things in life  
This is a chance  
I'm gonna take  
Gonna kick out trouble and strife  
  
I grow sick and tired of the same old lies  
Might look a little young  
So what's wrong  
You don't have to be old to be wise  
  
No I don't care that the people stare  
Accuse me of going mad  
Just get a long hard look into the mirror  
Then, tell me now who's been had  
  
The way things are going I won't get to show 'em  
Go single all the time's up to me  
So it's off with the ties  
No compromise  
Wanna taste what it's like to be free  
  
I grow sick and tired of the same old lies  
Might look a little young  
So what's wrong  
You don't have to be old to be wise  
  
I grow sick and tired of the same old lies  
Might look a little young  
So what's wrong  
You don't have to be old to be wise  
  
Alright, I'm gonna gather my things  
Go through the door  
Live and let live from now on  
At last a free hand, no longer pre-planned  
I got a will of my own  
  
I go as I please  
Fend for myself  
Pull all the stops, throw the dice  
Out on my own, gonna go it alone  
When I need it  
Then I'll ask for advice  
  
You don't have to be old to be wise  
You don't have to be old to be wise  
You don't have to be old to be wise  
You don't have to be old to be wise  
You don't have to be old to be wise  
You don't have to be old to be wise  
You don't have to be old to be wise  

Standing by my window, breathing summer breeze  
Saw a figure floating, 'neath the willow tree  
Asked us if we were happy, we said we didn't know  
Took us by the hands and up we go  
  
We followed the dreamer through the purple hazy clouds  
He could control our sense of time  
We thought we were lost but no matter how we tried  
Everyone was in peace of mind  
  
We felt the sensations drift inside our frames  
Finding complete contentment there  
And all the tensions that hurt us in the past  
Just seemed to vanish in thin air  
  
He said in the cosmos is a single sonic sound  
That is vibrating constantly  
And if we could grip and hold on to the note  
We would see our minds were free...oh they're free  
  
We are lost above  
Floating way up high  
If you think you can find a way  
You can surely try

Came in this morning high on a bird's wing  
Quite open minded but still quite aware  
Followed the sunrise right through from dawning  
Picking out landmarks that said I was there  
Led to positions by stern faced leaders  
Who never let one smile depart from their face  
  
Then with an arm raise the slaughter is started  
One or two crack up and start to cry  
Selfishness breeds in this cesspool of sorrow  
Every few moments I see I friend die  
Synchronized watches flash in the sunlight  
As into the battle we are all led  
  
Killer, killer, keep your thoughts at bay  
Maiming, destroying, every single day  
Is this the way that you get your fun  
Slaying, waylaying, in the heat of the midday sun  
  
Get out, get out, go and do your job  
Rape and pillage, squander all and rob  
You make me sick, getting paid for murder  
You wouldn't lay a finger on your mother, oh no  
You never ever dream to hurt her  
  
Hero, hero, you have done so well  
So sit back and lick your wounds, cause you won't go to hell  
Take your medal, wear it now with pride  
Consolation for the pain and sin you feel inside

Wrapped tight around me  
Like a second flesh hot skin  
Cling to my body  
As the ecstasy begins  
  
Your wild vibrations  
Got me shooting from the hip  
Crazed and insatiable let 'er rip  
  
Eat me alive  
  
Sounds like an animal  
Panting to the beat  
Groan in the pleasure zone  
Gasping from the heat  
  
Gut-wrenching frenzy  
That deranges every joint  
I'm gonna force you at gun point  
  
To eat me alive  
  
Bound to deliver  
As you give and I collect  
Squealing impassioned  
As the rod of steel injects  
  
Lunge to the maximum  
Spread-eagled to the wall  
You're well equipped to take it all  
  
So eat me alive  

Up here in space  
I'm looking down on you  
My lasers trace  
Everything you do  
  
You think you've private lives  
Think nothing of the kind  
There is no true escape  
I'm watching all the time  
  
I'm made of metal  
My circuits gleam  
I am perpetual  
I keep the country clean  
  
I'm elected electric spy  
I'm protected electric eye  
  
Always in focus  
You can't feel my stare  
I zoom into you  
You don't know I'm there  
  
I take a pride in probing all your secret moves  
My tearless retina takes pictures that can prove  
  
I'm made of metal  
My circuits gleam  
I am perpetual  
I keep the country clean  
  
I'm elected electric spy  
I'm protected electric eye  
  
Electric eye, in the sky  
Feel my stare, always there  
There's nothing you can do about it  
Develop and expose  
I feed upon your every thought  
And so my power grows  
  
I'm made of metal  
My circuits gleam  
I am perpetual  
I keep the country clean  
  
I'm elected electric spy  
I'm protected electric eye  
  
I'm elected electric spy  
  
I'm Elected. Protected. Detective. Electric eye

The old man's sitting there, his head bowed down  
Every now and then he'll take a look around  
And his eyes reflect the memory-pain of years gone by  
He can't regain nostalgic dreams he'll never see again  
  
With trembling hands, he wipes a tear  
Many fall like rain, there's one for every year  
And his life laid out so clearly now, life that's brought death  
So nearly now life once he clung to dearly now lets go  
  
But spare a thought as you pass him by  
Take a closer look and you'll say  
He's our tomorrow, just as much as we are his yesterday  
  
A lonely grave, and soon forgot  
Only wind and leaves lament his mournful song  
Yet they shout his epitaph out clear  
For anyone who's passing near  
It names the person lying here as you  
And you, and you, and you

We turn and face each other  
My fingers pull your hair  
You wince and jerk my wrist off  
I bite my lip and stare  
Your stance at once defiant  
I'm rigid to your pose  
You clench your teeth in anger  
My loving swells and grows  
  
You give me evil fantasies  
I wanna get inside your mind  
Come on and live my fantasies  
I'll show you evil you can't hide  
  
You're dragged into my vision  
Trapped, serving to my need  
Maybe imagination  
Is where my dark side feeds  
You slide your nails down in me  
I raise my structure high  
You pout, I snarl, you whimper  
And wave compassion by  
  
You give me evil fantasies  
I wanna get inside your mind  
Come on and live my fantasies  
I'll show you evil you can't hide  
  
Gonna take you, gotta get through  
Gonna make you, do what I want  
  
You're dragged into my vision  
Trapped, serving to my need  
Maybe imagination  
Is where my dark side feeds  

Racing' cross the heavens  
Straight into the dawn  
Looking like a comet  
Slicing through the morn  
Scorching the horizon  
Blazing the land  
Now he's here amongst us  
The age of fire's at hand  
  
Stand by for Exciter  
Salvation is his task  
Stand by for Exciter  
Salvation bids to ask  
  
Everything he touches  
Fries into a crisp  
Let him get close to you  
So you're in his trip  
First you'll smoke and moulder  
Blister up and singe  
When ignition hits you  
The very soul of your being will cringe  
  
Stand by for Exciter  
Salvation is his task  
Stand by for Exciter  
Here he comes now  
Fall to you knees and repent if you please  
  
Who is this man?  
Where is he from?  
Exciter comes  
For everone  
You'll never see him  
But you will taste the fire upon your tongue  
  
He's come to make you snap out  
Of the state that you are in  
Looks around and make you  
See the light again  
So much self-indulgence  
Results in shattered eyes  
Predominant complacency  
Leads to beguiling lies  
  
Stand by for Exciter  
Salvation is his task  
Stand by for Exciter  
Salvation bids to ask  
  
When he leaps amidst us  
With combustive dance  
All shall bear the branding  
Of his thermal lance  
Cauterising masses  
melting into one  
Only when there's order  
Will his job be done  
Stand by for Exciter  
Salvation is his task  
Stand by for Exciter  
Here he comes now  
Fall to your knees and repent if you please  
  
Who is this man?  
Where is he from?  
Exciter comes  
For everone  
You'll never see him  
But you will taste the fire upon your tongue  
  
Racing' cross the heavens  
Straight into the dawn  
Looking like a comet  
Slicing through the morn  
Scorching the horizon  
Blazing the land  
Now he's here amongst us  
The age of fire's at hand  
  
Stand by for Exciter  
Stand by for Exciter  
Stand by for Exciter  
Stand by for Exciter

They are dying on the dance floor  
They are lying in debris  
They are fading with exhaustion  
From the mortal injuries  
  
They are hungry and need feeding  
They've resigned themselves to fate  
They are desperate men  
Death's written on their face  
  
When your will to live  
Is all but gone  
And you're left alone  
But you need someone - feed on me  
Feed on me  
  
They're outgunned and they're outnumbered  
But they'll never turn to run  
And the "In the name of freedom's"  
Written with their blood  
  
Some would call them mercenary  
But they always knew the pain  
Inevitably far outweighs the gain  
  
Feed on me  
Feed on me if you need to breathe  
Feed on me  
When your hunger strikes you down again  
And you feel your inner strength has drained feed on me  
Feed on me  
  
Feed on me I got what you need  
Feed on me  
Feed on me don't accept defeat  
  
They are dying on the dance floor  
They are lying in debris  
They are fading with exhaustion  
From the mortal injuries  
  
Some would call them mercenary  
But they always knew the pain  
Inevitably far outweighs the gain  
  
When your will to live has almost gone  
And you're left alone and you need someone  
Feed on me  
Feed on me  
  
Feed on me  
Feed on me I got what you need  
Feed on me  
Feed on me don't accept defeat

I'd spend my days alone  
I used to stay at home  
Lost in seclusion there  
Like I was in a cell  
A captured heart as well  
Surrounded by despair  
Darkness filled my soul  
Losing all control  
  
Down on the streets below  
Bright city lights would glow  
The energy would rise  
And through the heat I'd gaze  
Still counting empty days  
With fire in my eyes  
Living through this hell  
Can I break this spell  
  
Fever. You set my soul on fire  
Fever. You fill me with desire  
Fever. You always get it right  
Fever. All day and all night  
  
Then one night as I walked  
I heard your body talk  
I saw a shooting star  
In some magnetic trance  
Our beating hearts would dance  
And crash down from afar  
Oh how strange fate is  
Never dreamed of this  
  
Fever. You set my soul on fire  
Fever. You fill me with desire  
Fever. You always get it right  
Fever. All day and all night  
  
So destiny has bought us  
Oh so close together  
We were like angels in the night  
Living the dream  
At last I'll be with you forever  
And all at once it feels so right  
  
Fever. You set my soul on fire  
Fever. You fill me with desire  
Fever. You always get it right  
Fever. All day and all night  

Stand and face each other  
Don't know what to say  
But that look in your eyes  
Give it all away  
You say you've got these feelings  
You can't put into words  
But you don't have to say a thing  
'Cause I've already heard  
Give me one good reason  
Why this has to be  
That's all I'm asking for  
Don't say that it's over  
When you and I both know  
You can't put out this love  
The fire burns below  
We've been through so much together  
We've laughed and we've sometimes cried  
To say our love ain't working, well we  
Haven't really tried  
But why let's talk things over  
Love can't be bought and sold  
One more night together's what the future holds  
What the future holds  
Well, give me one good reason  
Why this has to be  
I said that's all I'm asking for  
Can't you see I said  
You can't put out the fire down below  

Mercenary battalions  
Are poised to strike us down  
Terminations conquest  
Upon us now full grown  
  
Save me, my heart's open wide  
Help me, no question of pride  
Save me, my people have died  
Total genocide  
  
Devastation hungers  
She waits to leap to earth  
Imminent liquidation  
Before the grand rebirth  
  
Save me, my heart's open wide  
Help me, no question of pride  
Save me, my people have died  
Total genocide  
  
Sin after sin I have endured  
Yet the wounds I bear are the wounds of love  
  
Frantic mindless zombies  
Grab at fleeting time  
Lost in cold perplexion  
Waiting for the sign  
  
Generations tremble  
Clinging face to face  
Helpless situation  
To end the perfect race  
  
Flashing senseless sabers  
Cut us to the ground  
Eager for the life blood  
Of all who can be found  
  
Save me, my heart's open wide  
Help me, no question of pride  
Save me, my people have died  
Total genocide  
  
Slice to the left, slice to the right  
None to retaliate, none will fight  
Chopping at the hearts, snuffing out the lives  
This race departs, no one will survive  
Heads to the feet, feet to the air  
Souls in the soil, heavy in despair  
End of all ends, body into dust  
To greet death friends, extinction is a must

Never straight and narrow  
I won't keep in time  
Tend to burn the arrow  
Out of the line  
  
Been inclined to wander  
Off the beaten track  
That's where there's thunder  
And the wind shouts back  
  
Grinder  
Looking for meat  
Grinder  
Wants you to eat  
  
Got no use for routine  
I shiver at the thought  
Open skies are my scene  
That's why I won't get caught  
  
Refuse to bite the mantrap  
Be led to set the snare  
I love to have my sight  
Capped everywhere  
  
Grinder  
Looking for meat  
Grinder  
Wants you to eat  
  
(solo glenn)  
  
I've held my licence  
It came with birth,  
For self reliance on this earth  
You take the bullet  
On which my name  
Was etched upon in your game  
  
Day of independence  
Stamped us like a brand  
Round the necks of millions  
To the land  
  
As the mighty eagle  
I need room to breathe  
Witness from the treadmill  
I take my leave  
  
Grinder  
Looking for meat  
Grinder  
Wants you to eat

Whipcrack, stings the sky  
Don't mess with me I'm danger  
The meanest one alive  
  
Earthquake, breaks the Richter scale  
The more that you resist  
The more pain you'll feel  
  
I'm blazing on to glory  
There's thunder in my veins  
And nothing stands before me  
Forever I'll remain  
  
Hard as iron  
Sharp as steel  
Stop for no man  
You better beg and kneel  
  
Untouched, cold as ice  
I'll turn your blood to water  
Strangle in my vice  
  
Shock waves, bones to dust  
You're messin' with a mine field  
So expect the worst  
  
I'm blazing on to glory  
There's thunder in my veins  
And nothing stands before me  
Forever I'll remain  
  
Hard as iron  
Sharp as steel  
Stop for no man  
You better beg and kneel  
  
As I destroy, last thing you'll hear me cry  
Is victory, is victory  
  
I'm blazing on to glory  
There's thunder in my veins  
And nothing stands before me  
Forever I'll remain  
  
Hard as iron  
Sharp as steel  
Stop for no man  
You better beg and kneel

Hit 'em boys!  
Well I've said it before, and I'll say it again  
You get nothing for nothing: expect it when  
You're backseat driving, and your hands ain't on the wheel  
It's easy to go along with the crowd,  
And find later on that your say ain't allowed  
Oh that's the way to find what you've been missing  
So I'm heading out to the highway  
I got nothing to lose at all  
I'm gonna do it my way  
Take a chance before I fall  
A chance before I fall!  
You can hang in a left or hang in a right  
The choice it is yours to do as you might  
The road is open wide to place your bidding  
Now, wherever you turn, wherever you go  
If you get it wrong, at least you can know  
There's miles and miles to put it back together!  
And I'm heading out to the highway  
I got nothing to lose at all  
I'm gonna do it my way  
Take a chance before I fall  
A chance before I fall!  
On the highway!  
On the highway!  
Making a curve or taking the strain  
On the decline, or out on the wain  
Oh everybody breaks down sooner or later  
We'll put it to rights, we'll square up and mend.  
Back on your feet to take the next bend!  
You weather every storm that's coming atcha!  
And I'm heading out to the highway  
I got nothin' to lose at all  
I'm gonna do it my way  
Take a chance before I fall  
Yes, I'm heading out to the highway,  
I got nothing to lose at all.I got nothing to lose at all!

Raise the sights, the city lights are calling  
We're hot tonight, the time is right, there's nitro in the air  
In the street is where we'll meet, we're warning  
On the beat, we won't retreat, beware  
  
Thousand of cars and a million guitars  
Screaming with power in the air  
We've found the place where the decibels race  
This army of rock will be there  
  
To ram it down, ram it down  
Straight through the heart of this town  
Ram it down, ram it down  
Razing the place to the ground  
Ram it down  
  
Bodies revvin' in leather heaven in wonder  
Lights are dimmin' and heads are swimmin' as thunder hits the stage  
Hell breaks loose, turn on the juice get stronger  
We metal maniacs begin to rave  
  
Thousand of cars and a million guitars  
Screaming with power in the air  
We've found the place where the decibels race  
This army of rock will be there  
  
To ram it down, ram it down  
Straight through the heart of this town  
Ram it down, ram it down  
Razing the place to the ground  
Ram it down  
  
Shout it out, we're all together now  
Shout it out, we join as one, one  
  
Thousand of cars and a million guitars  
Screaming with power in the air  
We've found the place where the decibels race  
This army of rock will be there  
  
To ram it down, ram it down  
Straight through the heart of this town  
Ram it down, ram it down  
Razing the place to the ground  
Ram it down

When the power chords come crashing down  
Go tearing through my senses  
It's for the strong, not for the weak  
In light and dark dimension  
  
It stimulates, regenerates  
It's therapeutic healing  
It lifts our feet up off the ground  
And blasts us through the ceiling  
  
Between the eyes  
I hear it screaming  
And it electrifies  
Your inner feelings  
  
Hot shock waves charge the air  
All heads are banging  
Fists pumping everywhere  
Guitars are cranking  
  
Heavy metal, heavy metal  
What do you want  
Heavy metal, heavy metal  
What do you want  
  
Ten thousands lights come blazing down  
With razor sharp precision  
The speakers pour out molten steel  
The beat gives double vision  
  
An armor plated raging beast  
That's born of steel and leather  
It will survive against all odds  
Stampeding on forever  
  
Between the eyes  
I hear it screaming  
And it electrifies  
Your inner feelings  
  
Hot shock waves charge the air  
All heads are banging  
Fists pumping everywhere  
Guitars are cranking  
  
Heavy metal, heavy metal  
What do you want  
Heavy metal, heavy metal  
What do you want

Like wild fire  
Comes roaring  
Mad whirlwind  
Burning the road  
  
Black thunder  
White lightning  
Speed demons cry  
The Hell Patrol  
  
Night riders  
Death dealers  
Storm bringers  
Tear up the ground  
  
Fist flying  
Eyes blazing  
They're glory bound  
The Hell Patrol  
  
Brutalize you  
Neutralize you  
Gonna go for your throat as you choke  
Then they'll vaporize you  
  
Terrorize you  
Pulverize you  
Gonna cut to the bone as you groan  
And they'll paratamize you  
  
Crome Monsters  
Steel Warriors  
Soul Stealers  
Ripping out hearts  
They're Devil Dogs  
The Hell Patrol

Here they come  
These gods of steel  
Megatron  
Devouring what's concealed  
Speed of Death  
Crossfired they stare  
Final breath  
From vaporizing glares  
  
Raised to man oppressed  
Sign of persecution  
  
Hellrider  
Roars through the night  
Hellrider  
Raised for the fight  
  
All incensed  
To overthrow  
Strong defense  
With armaments they grow  
By this quest  
Their fate's renowned  
Put to rest  
Abominations crown  
  
Time to ram it down  
Judgment for the tyrant  
  
Fight undying and eternal  
Wheels bring death and pain infernal  
Honor bound your strength repleted  
To no end they're undefeated  
  
Hellrider, Hellrider  
You fought their battle for them  
Hellrider, Hellrider  
You brought them through their despair  
Hellrider, Hellrider  
Your tempered steel relinquished  
Hellrider, Hellrider  
You slaught them all extinguished  
  
Wrath of doom  
In killing fields  
They consume  
Their valiants never yield  
  
Triumph to the gods  
Vanquished of enslavers  
  
Hellrider  
Breaking their will  
Hellrider  
In for the kill  
  
Hellrider, Hellrider  
You fought their battle for them  
Hellrider, Hellrider  
You brought them through it all  
Hellrider

I've done my share of workin' out  
I wanna go some place where I can scream and shout  
Show me the lights, where I can find  
The only thing I need to give me peace of mind  
  
I wanna go, I wanna go, I wanna go hot rockin'  
  
Where is the spark that kicks the air  
Where is the energy that charges everywhere  
I see the crowd, I hear the roar  
I feel my body to leave the ground and soar  
  
I wanna go, I wanna go, I wanna go hot rockin'  
  
I'm goin' out in search of the bright lights  
Somehow I feel that tonight is the right night  
I'm almost there I've got the vibration  
It's coming strong from this generation  
My blood is hot, from now on I'm set free  
My pulse is hot, so don't try to stop me  
'Cause this is it and I'm hot rockin'  
  
Don't let it stop, don't let it end  
Please let it carry on and on and on again  
I get so high. Knocked off my feet yeah  
This is the only way I want, I want, I want  
  
I wanna go, I wanna go, I wanna go hot rockin'  
  
It's all I want, it's all I crave  
I just want to go hot rockin'

I am love, I am hate  
I'm an atheist with faith  
Vent my anger with a smile  
I'm polite or obscene  
Either whisper or I scream  
I'm not quite what I seem  
I'm somewhere in between  
  
I am young in my old age  
I am calm or in a rage  
I'm your friend or enemy  
A pacifist or at war  
I am rich but I am poor  
I'm all extremes  
I'm nowhere in between  
  
Wide awake  
Or in a dream  
Nowhere in between  
Like the pulse of a machine  
I'm driven to extremes  
  
I feel the turmoil boil in me  
I'm neither healthy nor diseased  
I am all extremes  
But I'm still in between  
  
Say right or say wrong  
Outcast yet I belong  
I'm high or I'm dry  
Say I am weak yet I am strong  
  
In between  
In between  
  
I am my alter ego  
I am subconsciously  
In depth but also shallow  
Or somewhere in between  
  
Oh I know I am  
Always first in line or last  
I swim with sharks or drown with rats  
I'll defend as I attack  
My world and yours are not the same  
I am in a different lane  
I am not where I seem  
But I'm somewhere in between  
  
I seek revenge  
As I forgive  
I die to live ah  
Not afraid but scared to death  
I don't fit in  
  
In between all extremes

I came across a smoking field, pulsating afterglow  
I saw a seering flash of light erupt and skyward go  
I staggered back in dazed surprise  
What was it I had seen?  
And as I stood there mesmerized I heard my spirit scream  
  
Invader invader nearby  
Invader, invader is nigh  
  
This is the first of more to come in carefully planned attacks  
If it is so we must prepare defenses to fight back  
The call is out throughout the world  
United we must stand  
To build a line, strategic force, they will not take a man  
  
Invader invader nearby  
Invader, invader is nigh  
  
When they come to take control every man must play his role  
They won't take our world away when the children we leave  
Will have to believe in today  
  
We warn you now you things out there  
Whatever you may send  
We won't give in without a fight, a fight until the end  
With vigilance by day and night our scanners trace the sky  
A shield is sealed upon this earth, a shield you won't get by  
  
Invader invader nearby  
Invader, invader is nigh  

Beware of their coming  
Take heed our time is near  
Fatality relinquish not  
Brutality in arms doth seek to destroy.  
  
They smashed through the clouds into the light of the moon  
Their steeds were full charging, called destruction and doom  
'Twas as if all hell had broke loose on this night  
And all in all it was a terrible sight  
  
Now we are taken unto the island of domination  
  
We gotta get, we gotta get, we gotta get out of this place  
There's a man with a needle who's pleading to get at my face  
Hide me and hold me control free as best as you can  
It's all becoming too much, I can't cope, for one man  
  
Now we are taken unto the island of domination  
  
Skyrider, you supersonic flyer  
Nightdriver, you demon of desire  
Spinesnapper, you tried your best to break us  
Throatchoker, you thought that you could take us  
  
The fright of your life, the fright of your life  
The fright of your life is here guaranteed  
This is no illusion confessing confusion you're freed  
Lashings of strappings with beatings competing to win  
Oh what a mess I am blessed, dominations set in  
Now we are taken unto the island of domination

Deadly as the viper  
Peering from its coil  
The poison there is coming to the boil  
  
Ticking like a time bomb  
The fuse is running short  
on the verge of snapping if it's caught  
  
And all the pressure that's been building up  
For all the years it bore the load  
The cracks appear, the frame starts to distort  
Ready to explode  
  
Jawbreaker  
  
Crouching in the corner  
Wound up as a spring  
Piercing eyes that flash are shimmering  
  
Muscles are all contorted  
Claws dug in the dirt  
Every ounce of fiber on alert  

Your innocence all but fades  
When we peel the veneer away  
It's all an act which you stage  
With your two-faced barricades  
  
Rage consumes  
You every night  
Caged inside you  
Trying to get out  
  
Schizophrenic basic needs  
Fools me into complacency  
But now I see through your facade  
Behind the mask a monster snarls  
  
Hatred burning  
In your chest  
Dazed but learning  
In your quest  
  
Oh it's killing me your unpredictability  
Oh all the time  
You hide behind  
Your Jekyll and Hyde  
  
Now I realize  
There's a dark side  
Disguised  
  
Always changing  
Then love hating  
Baiting me  
  
Your innocence all but fades  
When we peel the veneer away  
It's all an act which you stage  
With your two-faced barricades  
  
Rage consumes you every night  
Caged inside you trying to get out  
  
Oh it's killing me your unpredictability  
Oh all the time  
You hide behind  
Your Jekyll and Hyde

White bolt of lightning  
Came out of nowhere  
Blinded the darkness  
Creating the storm  
War in the heavens  
Vengeance ignited  
Torment and tempest  
Attacks like a swarm  
  
Forged out of Flame  
From chaos to destiny  
Bringer of pain  
Forever undying  
  
Judas is Rising  
  
Eternal betrayer  
Ice cold and evil  
Taking no prisoners  
Dark prince of the world  
Humanity trembles  
Enslaving you sinners  
You can't beg for mercy  
For none will be saved  
The burden of sin  
Echoes the prophecy  
Ascending from hell  
Forever despising  
  
Judas is Rising  
  
Their faith is revealed  
Deceivers are crying  
By crucified steel  
Evangelising  
  
Judas is Rising  
Judas is Rising

Call for the priest, I'm dying...  
  
Well, the pressure's too much, you know I peaked last night  
I gotta get some a quick release  
City is standing on my shoulders  
My body's going piece by piece  
Ooh..!  
  
Yes I know what I want and I know where to get it  
And I'm going there right away  
This is one priest that I don't have to fall on  
Down to my knees and pray  
Ooh..!  
  
When your back's to the wall come along one and all  
We shall fight all the slander that's penned  
It's us we shall choose let the bigoted lose  
For our triumph's the means to their end  
  
With you by my side I shall ride every storm  
  
Let the cynics drop dead in their critical head  
They're wrist merchants as we all can see  
Bunch of deaf ears with their columnized fears  
What a shame, what a shame, oh dear me!  
Ooh..!

Living after midnight, rockin' to the dawn  
Lovin' 'til the morning, then I'm gone, I'm gone  
I took the city 'bout one A.M, loaded, loaded  
I'm all geared up to score again, loaded, loaded  
I come alive in the neon light  
That's when I make my moves right  
Living after midnight, rockin' to the dawn  
Lovin' 'til the morning, then I'm gone, I'm gone  
Got gleaming chrome, reflecting steel, loaded, loaded  
Ready to take on every deal, loaded, loaded  
My pulse is racing, I'm hot to take  
This motor's revved up, fit to break  
Living after midnight, rockin' to the dawn  
Lovin' 'til the morning, then I'm gone, I'm gone  
I'm aiming for ya I'm gonna floor ya  
My body's coming  
All night long  
The air's electric, sparkin' power, loaded, loaded  
I'm getting hotter by the hour, loaded, loaded  
I set my sights and then home in  
The joint starts flying when I begin  
Living after midnight, rockin' to the dawn  
Lovin' 'til the morning, then I'm gone, I'm gone

I'm hypnotised  
And helpless  
Beneath the pale  
Full moon  
My body is your sacrifice  
You spirit's coming soon  
  
I stare up at a  
Squalid night  
  
It's been so cold  
And smooth  
Turns tender kisses  
Into bites  
As you begin to move  
  
You look so weak  
And fragile  
You seem to drip  
And sway  
But you swept me up into  
Your arms  
And carried me away  
  
I'm living bad dreams  
I can't run from you  
I'm living bad dreams  
This nightmare's  
Coming true  
  
You led me to temptation  
Delivered me to pain  
I walked upon you  
Hallowed ground  
My soul is yours to gain  
  
Your passion drains  
My energy  
Fear starts running deep  
I'm falling in  
Slow motion  
Into eternal sleep  
  
I'm living bad dreams  
I can't run from you  
I'm living bad dreams  
This nightmare's  
Coming true  
  
[Lead Break]  
  
Your passion drains  
My energy  
Fear starts running deep  
I'm falling in  
Slow motion  
Into eternal sleep  
  
I'm living bad dreams  
I can't run from you  
I'm living bad dreams  
There's nothing  
I can do  
  
I'm living bad dreams  
I can't run from you  
I'm living bad dreams  
This nightmare's  
Coming true  
  
I'm living bad dreams  
Ohh ohh  
I don't want bad dreams  
Living bad dreams

Grey mist drifts upon the water  
The mirrored surface moves  
Awakened of this presence  
Dispelling legends proof  
  
A beastly head of onyx  
With eyes set coals of fire  
It's leathered hide glides glistening  
Ascends the heathered briar  
  
This legend lives through centuries  
Evoking history's memories  
Prevailing in eternities  
On and on and on  
  
Loch Ness confess  
Your terror of the deep  
Loch Ness distress  
Malingers what you keep  
Loch Ness protects monstrosity  
Loch Ness confess to me  
  
Somehow it heeds the piper  
From battlements that call  
From side to side it ponders  
In passion in the skirl  
  
This highland lair of mystery  
Retains a lost world empathy  
Resilient to discovery  
On and on and on  
  
This legend lives through centuries  
Evoking history's memories  
Prevailing in eternity  
Your secret lies safe with me  
  
This creature's peril from decease  
Implores to mankind for release  
A legacy to rest in peace  
On and on and on

I can't stand the way you move it  
You drive me crazy with that walk  
You get me so excited  
I tremble and I shake  
When you make the moves you make  
  
You've got the key  
The key to my heart  
Go ahead and use it  
Drag me in, slam the door  
Then I'll be yours, for evermore  
  
You've got me locked in  
Locked inside your love  
You've got me locked in  
Locked inside your love  
  
I can't take it when you touch me  
Feels so good I could explode  
You've got me in a frenzy  
I tremble and I quake  
When you shake the things you shake  
  
You've got the key  
The key to my heart  
Go ahead and use it  
Drag me in, slam the door  
Then I'll be yours, for evermore  
  
You've got me locked in  
Locked inside your love  
You've got me locked in  
Locked inside your love  
Locked in  
Locked inside your love  
You've got me locked in  
Locked inside your love  
  
You've got the key  
The key to my heart  
Go ahead and use it  
Drag me in, slam the door  
Then I'll be yours, for evermore  
  
You've got me locked in  
Locked inside your love  
You've got me locked in  
Locked inside your love  
You've got me locked in, baby  
Locked inside your love  
You've got me locked in  
Locked inside your love  
  
You've got me locked in, baby  
Locked inside your love  
You've got me locked in  
Locked inside your love  
You've got me locked in  
Locked inside your love  
You've got me locked in  
Locked inside your love  

I carry with me all the love that you give  
You brought me serenity, a reason to live  
Our life is a journey  
That we took from the start  
We made all these memories together  
  
I can remember  
The first time that we met  
The feelings you gave to me, I'll never forget  
I knew from that moment  
When our love first began  
We'd last till the end of time forever  
  
And though there were bad times  
We stood by each other  
And did what we had to get through  
  
You live in my heart, when you're far away  
I see you in dreams where I hear you say  
I'm with you forever, in true love  
By light of the day and stars above  
  
And when there were bad times  
We held on each other  
To face what we had to get through  
  
You live in my heart, when you're far away  
I see you in dreams, when I hear you say  
Look up to heaven, and I'll be there  
Still guiding my heart  
Still saying our prayer

When you feel safe  
When you feel warm  
That's when I rise  
That's when I crawl  
  
Gliding on mist  
Hardly a sound  
Bring the kiss  
Evils abound  
  
In the dead of night  
Love bites  
Love bites  
In the dead of night  
Love bites  
  
Into your room  
Where in deep sleep  
There you lie still  
To you I creep  
  
Then I descend  
Close to your lips  
Across you I bend  
You smile as I sip  
  
Now you are mine  
In my control  
One taste of your life  
And I own your soul  
  
Softly you stir  
Gently you moan  
Lust's in the air  
Wake as I groan  
  
In the dead of night  
Love bites  
Love bites  
In the dead of night  
Love bites  
  
Love bites you  
Invites you  
To feast in the night  
Excites you  
Delights you  
It drains you to white  
Love bites  
  
You knew at first sight  
You'd enjoy my attack  
That with my first bite  
There'd be no turning back  
  
So come in my arms  
I strike any hour  
I will return  
To trap and devour  
  
In the dead of night  
Love bites

You get me up, then we both get down  
We roll all night makin' heavy sounds  
I'm all tied up on your bed  
I'd rather be inside your head  
  
Don't do this, do it like that oh yeah  
You've hit the spot, give it all you got  
I don't care  
  
I'll teach you a lesson  
That you won't forget  
Why don't you save your breath  
'Cause I'm gonna love ya' to death  
  
I'm comin' to the point, I can't hold back  
Then you ease off with your attack  
You're the best I've had if you please  
You never stop, you great big tease  
  
Don't do this, do it like that oh yeah  
You've hit the spot, give it all you got  
I don't care  
  
I'll teach you a lesson  
That you won't forget  
Why don't you save your breath  
'Cause I'm gonna love ya' to death  
  
You can take me places, I thought I'd never go  
And when you turn your love on me  
Baby you're the star of the show  
  
You can take me places, I thought I'd never go  
And when you turn your love on me  
Baby you're the star of the show  
  
I'll teach you a lesson  
That you won't forget  
Why don't you save your breath  
'Cause I'm gonna love ya' to death

Licensed to kill  
On my 650 Bonneville  
"Hellfire" we yell  
Fueled and indestructible  
  
Get it down  
To take the crown  
Neon daze  
Renegades  
  
No fear just hate  
Drives us to the ultimate  
Cut loose extremes  
On our maniac machines  
  
Take me down  
Or hit the ground  
Neon nights  
At the speed of light  
  
So you motherfuckers want to race  
You've all got loser tattooed on your face  
  
Machine Man's running - you wanna try  
Machine Man's coming - you're gonna die  
  
Ignite the engines  
You can hear it scream  
You're gonna eat your words  
That challenged this machine  
  
The beast is revved up  
The flag is down  
The tires screech  
And lay a smoke screen all around  
  
Through the limits  
As they rocket past  
It's a blood bath  
There's no second place  
  
Machine Man's running - you wanna try  
Machine Man's coming - you're gonna die  
  
Machine Man - Machine Man's coming  
Machine Man - Machine Man's coming  
  
Ice nerves of steel  
As I notch another kill  
You lose - I win  
I get to ride again  
  
Get it down  
Hit the ground  
Neon nights  
Speed of light  
  
Feel no mercy as I cross the line  
Watch the suckers self-destruct behind  
  
Machine Man's running  
You wanna try  
Machine Man's coming  
You're gonna die  
  
Machine Man's running - you wanna try  
Machine Man's coming - you're gonna die  
  
Machine Man - Machine Man's coming  
Machine Man - Machine Man's coming

We're walking the streets  
We know where we'll meet  
  
Can't stop us  
They don't know why they try  
Can't hurt us  
We'll never die  
  
We are on the march of the damned  
Of the damned  
March of the damned  
  
We know what's at stake  
Won't take your mistakes  
  
Can't break us  
We'll never fall, that's all  
It's over  
Just watch us grow  
  
We are on the march of the damned  
Of the damned  
March of the damned  
  
We're walking the streets  
We know where we'll meet  
  
Can't stop us  
They don't know why they try  
Can't hurt us  
We'll never die  
  
We are on the march of the damned  
  
Of the damned  
  
March of the damned

Something's calling in the night  
Electric madness roars in sight  
  
Heat is rising blazing fast  
Hot and evil feel the blast  
  
Out of control about to explode  
It's coming at ya  
  
Here comes the metal meltdown  
Run for your lives  
Can't stop the metal meltdown  
No-one survives  
  
Raging fury  
Wired for sound  
Nitro bombshell  
Shakes the ground  
  
High and mighty  
Rips the air  
Piercing lazer  
Burning glaze  
  
Out of control  
About to explode  
It's coming at ya  
  
Here comes the metal meltdown  
Run for your lives  
Can't stop the metal meltdown  
No-one survives  
  
Temperature is boiling  
Magnifying might  
Feeding like a virus  
Flashing light  
  
Imminent collision  
Shockwaves all around  
Generating energy  
Screams so loud  
  
It's comin' meltdown  
Start runnin' countdown

Unholy Satan begs  
He don't make no sense  
Striving down there to  
Recruit all of you  
Do not live in sin  
Or taste the fear again  
Someone's coming back  
Fuck the almanacs  
  
Premonition say  
Better step away  
Skeptics preach a lot  
Watch in aftershock  
Heed the prophecies  
In your offices  
Someone out the blue  
Explodes into view  
  
The time is near  
The day has dawned  
Be prepared  
For what's to come  
  
He's the man  
Armageddon  
Walking through fire  
Metal messiah  
He's the one  
The father, the son  
Creator destroyer  
Metal messiah  
  
Heaven's in a state  
Someone's at the gate  
Crashing isn't cool  
He don't know the rules  
Stepping in he says  
Time to rock the place  
Like they've got a choice  
Then all hell breaks loose  
  
Hell ain't ready for  
What he's got in store  
Time you fuckers had  
Change of management  
Better fornicate  
Before it's too late  
Cranks the power up  
As he detonates  
  
Never too late  
To extricate  
In the event  
Die or repent  
  
He's the man  
Armageddon  
Walking through fire  
Metal messiah  
He's the one  
The father, the son  
Creator destroyer  
Metal messiah  
  
You can pray to him  
Auditorium  
Buy the merchandise  
Cheap at twice the price  
Rising up above  
With his decibels  
He's come down to earth  
Next the universe  
  
The time is near  
The day has dawned  
Be prepared  
For what's to come  
  
Never too late  
To extricate  
In the event  
Die or repent  
  
Metal messiah  
Thy kingdom come  
They will be done

It started many years ago, out of the black country  
The seed became the embryo, for all on earth to see  
Like stealth the word spread mouth to mouth, all corners of the land  
And soon the thing began to grow, and get right out of hand  
  
From the concrete jungle  
The smoke, the dirt, the grime  
Could not contain the hunger  
It grew and grew in time, into a  
  
Monster. Monster of rock  
They could never bind it  
It vowed to reach the top  
Monster. Monster of rock  
They could never bind it  
Impossible to stop  
  
Took the sound across the seas, the people stood in awe  
At last the sound had come to them  
That they'd been waiting for  
  
And millions roared, and millions cheered  
This spectacle on stage  
And everyone went crazy as it bellowed out in rage  
  
From the concrete jungle  
The smoke, the dirt, the grime  
Could not contain the hunger  
I grew and grew in time, into a  
  
Monster. Monster of rock  
They could never bind it  
It vowed to reach the top  
Monster. Monster of rock  
They could never bind it  
Impossible to stop  
  
From the concrete jungle  
The smoke, the dirt, the grime  
Could not contain the hunger  
It grew and grew in time, into a  
  
Monster. Monster of rock  
They could never bind it  
It vowed to reach the top  
Monster. Monster of rock  
They could never bind it  
Impossible to stop

Hope in my heart  
As a new day has dawned  
I see your light on the wings of a dove  
Lifting me up as the dark clouds retreat  
Courage transcends and you make me complete  
Hope in my heart with the advent of spring  
I am reborn with the love that you bring  
  
Now at last my dream is real  
I found peace  
True love can heal  
On the journey throughout time  
A new beginning has arrived  
At the crossroads of my life  
This new love keeps me alive  
  
I never knew that this could happen to me  
So many lonely days and nights  
I never knew that you were waiting for me  
Hope was out of sight  
And suddenly I see the future clearly  
No longer living in the past  
As I let go  
  
Living the dream  
Of my life  
I was alone no-one in sight  
This love, make me believe that you're the one  
Never give up, our day has come  
  
I never felt that this could happen to me  
So many lonely days and lonely nights  
I never knew that you were waiting for me  
Hope was out of sight  
And suddenly I see the future clearly  
Finally I know at last  
I can let go  
  
Living the dream  
Of my life  
I was alone no-one in sight  
This love, ill never throw it all away  
Now that your in my life to stay

Howling winds keep screaming round  
And the rain comes pouring down  
Doors are locked and bolted now  
As the thing crawls into town  
  
Straight out of hell  
One of a kind  
Stalking his victim  
Don't look behind you  
  
Nightcrawler  
Beware the beast in black  
Nightcrawler  
You know he's coming back  
Night Crawler  
  
Sanctuary is being sought  
Whispered prayers a last resort  
Homing in its' cry distorts  
Terror struck they know they're caught  
  
Straight out of hell  
One of a kind  
Stalking his victim  
Don't look behind you  
  
Nightcrawler  
Beware the beast in black  
Nightcrawler  
You know he's coming back  
Night Crawler  
  
As night is falling  
The end is drawing near  
They'll hear  
Their last rites echo on the wind  
  
Huddled in the cellar  
Fear caught in their eyes  
Daring not to move or breathe  
As the creature cries  
Fingernails start scratching  
On the outside wall  
Clawing at the windows  
"Come to me" it calls  
Atmosphere's electric  
As it now descend the stairs  
  
Hiding in the darkness  
Is so futile from its glare  
Death comes in an instant  
As they hoped it would  
Souls ascend to heaven  
While it feasts on flesh and blood  

They never broke my will  
'cause my heart was strong  
They would justify  
Condemnation by invitation  
I will survive  
  
Stood my ground till the end  
Engaged the enemy  
Protect my friends  
  
Nostradamus, Nostradamus  
  
Tame the beast  
They send to kill  
The congregation never broke my will  
  
Nostradamus, Nostradamus  
  
He has overcome  
He can take the throne  
  
[Chorus]  
Nostradamus, dedication  
Nostradamus is avenged  
Nostradamus, our salvation  
Nostradamus is avenged  
  
I walked through fire to justify  
Their inquisitions now condemned to die  
  
Nostradamus, Nostradamus  
  
Adversity on which I thrived  
Destroys the alter, now I'm vilified  
  
Nostradamus, Nostradamus  
  
He has seized the day  
He is here to stay  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Vindication  
Ha has been avenged  
  
They never broke my will  
Cause my heart was strong  
they cannot justify  
i will survive  
  
He has overpowered  
This his finest hour  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Nostradamus  
Nostradamus  
Nostradamus  
Nostradamus

Where would you be without music  
You would be nowhere at all  
We wouldn't be here doing this now  
If you weren't having a ball  
  
One for the road, sharing our load, show us the way  
  
Can you imagine the silence  
Not even the pink or white noise  
Well thankfully we've got the license  
To have us some fun with the boys  
  
One for the road, sharing our load, show us the way  
  
The melody line's fascinating  
The rhythm is something divine  
It sends our adrenaline racing  
To see you all moving so fine  
  
One for the road, sharing our load, show us the way  
One for the road

Let me hear the battle cry  
Calling on the wind  
Let me see the banners fly  
Before the storm begins  
  
Let me feel the spirits soar  
Destroy the enemy  
Striking at the evil core  
For all the world to see  
  
This day will last forever  
Deep in the hearts of men  
Courage and victory  
Remember, remember  
  
One shot at glory  
In the crossfire overhead  
Fate stands before me  
Words have all been said  
  
One shot at glory  
Driving hard and seeing red  
Destiny calls me  
One night of fire  
One shot at glory  
  
Fighting on with dignity  
In life and death we deal  
The power and the majesty  
Amidst the blood and steel  
  
I still hear the battle cry  
The call goes on and on  
I still see the banners fly  
The battle's always won

I'm layin' awake at night  
I can't get you out of my mind  
All I can hear is my heart beat  
And a voice in the dark of some kind  
  
Where are you now  
The fears are comin' back to me once again  
Oh, I wish you were here  
Takin' good care of me  
I want you  
I feel as though I'm out in the cold  
  
Out in the cold  
Hear me calling  
Cold  
Out in the cold  
Please rescue me  
  
I know it was you I hurt  
I didn't mean to hurt you  
So much to forgive and forget  
Can't take anymore of this hurt  
On no, Oh no  
There's so many things I regret  
  
Where are you now  
The fears are comin' back to me once again  
Oh, I wish you were here  
Takin' good care of me  
I want you  
I feel as though I'm out in the cold  
  
Shut me out  
Out in the cold  
Where are you now  
Hear me calling  
I need you I'm so cold  
Can't you hear my heart beat  
Out in the cold  
Please rescue me  
  
Give me a chance baby  
There's nothing I wouldn't do to make it alright  
Just for one more chance baby  
I need all your lovin' tonight  
  
Where are you now  
The fears are comin' back to me once again  
Oh, I wish you were here  
Takin' good care of me  
I want you  
I feel as though I'm out in the cold  
  
Shut me out  
Out in the cold  
Where are you now  
Hear me calling  
I need you I'm so cold  
Can't you hear my heart beat  
Out in the cold  
Please rescue me  
Why don't you rescue me  
Cold  
Shut me out  
Out in the cold  
Where are you now  
Hear me calling  
I need you I'm so cold  
Can't you hear my heart beat  
Out in the cold  
Please rescue me  
Why don't you rescue me  
I'm so cold  
Shut me out  
Out in the cold  
Where are you now  
Hear me calling  
I need you I'm so cold  
Can't you hear my heart beat  
Out in the cold  
Please rescue me  

Faster than a bullet  
Terrifying scream  
Enraged and full of anger  
He's half man and half machine  
  
Rides the Metal Monster  
Breathing smoke and fire  
Closing in with vengeance soaring high  
  
He is the Painkiller  
This is the Painkiller  
  
Planets devastated  
Mankind's on its knees  
A saviour comes from out the skies  
In answer to their pleas  
  
Through boiling clouds of thunder  
Blasting bolts of steel  
Evils going under deadly wheels  
  
He is the Painkiller  
This is the Painkiller  
  
Faster than a lazer bullet  
Louder than an atom bomb  
Chromium plated boiling metal  
Brighter than a thousand suns  
  
Flying high on rapture  
Stronger free and brave  
Nevermore encaptured  
They've been brought back from the grave  
  
With mankind resurrected  
Forever to survive  
Returns from Armageddon to the skies  
  
He is the Painkiller  
This is the Painkiller  
Wings of steel Painkiller  
Deadly wheels Painkiller

You say I waste my life away, but I live it to the full  
And how would you know anyway, you're just mister dull  
Why don't you get into the things we do today  
You could lose twenty years right away, so we say  
  
We don't need, no, no no no parental guidance here  
  
Every day you scream at me to turn the music low  
Well if you keep on screaming, you'll make me deaf you know  
You always chew me out, because I stay out late  
Until your three-piece suit comes back in date, get one thing straight  
  
There's no communication  
I'm tired of explanation  
Is this message getting through  
You went through the same thing too  
Don't you remember what it's like to lose control  
Put on my jacket - for you get too old  
Let's rock n' roll  

We're watching you  
Nowhere to hide  
Obey the holy law  
Repent for your sins  
There is but one God  
  
Against their holy laws  
I'll do whatever it takes  
I've met their kind before  
We're martyrs burned at their stake  
  
They try to dominate  
I'll be the thorn in their side  
They underestimate  
The willpower feeding my pride  
  
[Chorus]  
Under the hand of persecution  
Defy the institution  
  
Their words just crucify  
Condemning truth that I seek  
They cannot justify  
The pain, the havoc they wreak  
  
I never will conform  
My faith is deep to the core  
I stand against reform  
I'll never kneel down before  
  
[Chorus]  
  
With raised fists of fire  
As they conspire  
I'll be defiant  
Against the alliance  
  
They will not eradicate me  
Break my will or suffocate me  
I will subjugate the hate  
That they breed  
  
As the church interrogates  
I cannot see they supplicate me  
Execute and ridicule  
We're all freed  
  
I never will conform  
My faith is deep to the core  
I stand against reform  
I'll never kneel down before  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Persecute  
You defy  
  
Execute crucify  
Crucify  
  
Persecute  
You defy  
  
Execute crucify  
Crucify  
  
Persecute  
You defy  
  
Execute crucify  
Crucify  
  
Persecute  
You defy  
  
Crucify  
You survive

When I saw your face  
I became a prisoner of your eyes  
And I would do just anything  
To stay and be with you.  
  
You know there are times  
When I let myself wonder  
As I was going under  
You Pulled me back to earth  
  
Don't you hear me crying  
Take me in your arms again  
Tell me that you're trying  
Or is our love a lie  
  
Love is blind  
And love deceives you  
You came along and captured me  
Now I'm a prisoner of your eyes  
Trapped in time  
I cannot leave you  
I'm just a prisoner of your eyes  
As each day goes by  
I've given up completely  
I've locked myself inside your heart  
And thrown away the key  
  
Only time will tell  
If I can live without you  
Can you live without you  
Can you see into the future  
Will you ever set me free  
  
Don't you hear me crying  
Take me into your arms again  
Tell me that you're trying  
Or is our love a lie  
  
Love is blind  
And love decieves you  
You came along and captured me  
Now I'm a prisoner of your eyes  
Trapped in time  
I cannot leave you  
I'm just a prisoner of your eyes  
  
In this heartache  
We can try and start again  
Stop the heartbreak  
A little time will help to kill the pain.

You think you're cool and got it all  
You think you run the scene  
I don't believe how you'd conceive  
That your good enough for me  
You think you've got it all sewn up  
But I'll cut you right down to size  
The way I figure you don't exist  
So you'd better realize  
  
Don't you touch  
Don't get near  
Don't take me for a fool  
Make no mistake  
No give and take  
I'm too good for you  
  
So keep your hands off  
Private property  
Hands off  
Oh oh  
Keep your hands off  
Private property  
Hands off me  
Hands off  
Keep your hands off me  
  
I'm number one when I turn it on  
Do you think you can relate  
You'd be amazed, left in a daze  
To see me operate  
  
Don't you touch  
Don't get near  
Don't take me for a fool  
Make no mistake  
No give and take  
I'm too good for you  
  
So keep your hands off  
Private property  
Hands off  
Oh oh  
Keep your hands off  
Private property  
Hands off  
Oh oh  
  
You live in a fantasy  
I don't even care.  
If you're lookin' for sympathy  
It ain't there  
  
Hands off  
Keep your dirty hands off me.  
  
So keep your hands off  
Private property  
Hands off  
Oh oh  
Keep your hands off  
Private property  
Hands off  
Oh oh  
Keep your hands off  
Private property  
Hands off  
Oh oh  
Keep your hands off  
Private property  
Hands off  
Oh oh  
Hands off

You'd better run  
You'd better run  
You'd better run from the  
Devil's gun  
The race is on  
The race is on  
Now you'd better run from the  
Devil's gun  
  
Strange things happen  
If you stay  
The devil will catch you  
Anyway  
He'll seek you here  
He'll seek you there  
The devil will seek you  
Everywhere  
  
Lead break  
  
And when he finds you  
You'll soon find out  
The devil's fire just won't  
Go out  
He burns you up  
From head to toe  
The devil's grip just won't  
Let go.

Raise the sights, the city lights are calling  
We're hot tonight, the time is right, there's nitro in the air  
In the street is where we'll meet, we're warning  
On the beat, we won't retreat, beware  
  
Thousands of cars and a million guitars  
Screaming with power in the air  
We've found the place where the decibels race  
This army of rock will be there  
  
To ram it down, ram it down  
Straight through the heart of this town  
Ram it down, ram it down  
Razing the place to the ground  
Ram it down  
  
Bodies revvin' in leather heaven in wonder  
Lights are dimmin' and heads are swimmin'  
As thunder hits the stage  
Hell breaks loose, turn on the juice get stronger  
We metal maniacs begin to rave  
  
Thousands of cars and a million guitars  
Screaming with power in the air  
We've found the place where the decibels race  
This army of rock will be there  
  
To ram it down, ram it down  
Straight through the heart of this town  
Ram it down, ram it down  
Razing the place to the ground  
Ram it down  
  
Shout it out, we're all together now  
Shout it out, we join as one, one  
  
Thousands of cars and a million guitars  
Screaming with power in the air  
We've found the place where the decibels race  
This army of rock will be there  
  
To ram it down, ram it down  
Straight through the heart of this town  
Ram it down, ram it down  
Razing the place to the ground  
Ram it down

Pounding the world like a battering ram  
Forging the furnace for the final grand slam  
Chopping away at the source soon the course will be done  
Leaving a trail of destruction that's second to none  
Hammering anvils straining muscle and might  
Shattering blows crashing browbeating fright  
Fast devastating and desolating the curse  
Blasting the cannons of truth through each man of this earth  
Wielding the axe comes the one culmination  
That's always seemed certain to bring down the curtain on greed  
Sifting the good from the bad it's the age for the rage  
Of the dogs which must fall to the just and be free  
Now grate for the vandals who trampled and sampled  
Till this place conditioned brought forth demolition to war  
The slipping and sliding corrosive subsiding  
That withered and waned till the world seemed all drained fills the bay  
Pounding the world like a battering ram  
Forging the furnace for the final grand slam  
Chopping away at the source soon the course will be done  
Leaving a trail of destruction that's second to none  
Second to none

I made the Spike about nine o'clock on a Saturday  
All eyes hit me as I walked into the bar  
The spikey leather guys were foolin with the denim dudes  
A couple cards played rough stuff, New York, Fire Island  
  
I cased the joint, straining at the scenes  
  
I moseyed up to the counter and the tender came a-grinnin'  
I snapped the smile off his face and snarled "Give me a bourbon"  
The mirror on the wall was collecting and reflecting  
All the heavy bodies ducking, stealing eager for some action  
The scene screwed me up, I saw some contact  
Then there he was, saw me and knew that  
  
I'd had too much, foolin' around  
Statues alive, seconds are hours  
  
Sex is like a hurricane it grabs and then it shatters  
I was barely holding on to this fine body symphony  
I guess I dream in pictures, not colors  
The true free expression I demand is human rights - right?  
  
I came the light, I am immortal  
  
I'm going, no loss  
I'm going, no loss  
I'm going, no loss  
I'm going, no loss  
  
Nightmare, just a bunch of goddamn, rotten, steaming, raw  
Deal  

When I'm far away  
And I can't get through  
Wherever I roam  
Keeps bringing me back to you  
  
Holding on to hope  
There's no need to fear  
Wherever I roam  
This piece of home  
Keeps telling you that I'm near  
  
So lift up your heart  
Cause the brave will always come through  
While we're apart  
We will raise the red, white and blue  
  
When I stand alone  
Without you by my side  
I think of all  
That you stand for  
It fills me up with pride  
  
Reaching out to you  
Across mountains, sea and sky  
I think of all  
That you stand for  
And hope will never die  
  
Now I'm coming home again  
I'm coming home to you  
And as I roam  
This piece of home  
Has brought me back to you

Redeemer of Soul  
Time to settle the score  
He's loaded to feel their remorse  
Steadfast strong that's for sure  
The deal of his life takes it's course  
No giving in  
They don't understand  
They get to give up and to meet his demands  
  
Count down coming your way  
He's the last to obey  
Watch him seizing the day  
Redeemer - redeemer of souls  
  
There's no holding him back  
The ransom announces his deeds  
He's not cutting you slack  
Just taking what ever he needs  
Diamonds for eyes  
As he begins  
On that two wheeler from hell on the wind  
  
Now he's setting the tune  
They know the stare down is soon  
Vengeance comes at high noon  
Redeemer of souls  
On the skyline  
The stranger draws near  
Feel the heat and he's shaking with fear  
  
Countdown coming your way  
He's the last to obey  
Watch him seizing the day  
Redeemer of souls

Shooting for the stars  
Cruise the speed of light  
Glowin god of Mars  
Body burning bright  
  
Well I'm ridin', ridin' on the wind  
Yes I'm ridin', ridin' on the wind  
  
Tearing up through life  
Million miles an hour  
Blinding all in sight  
Surging rush of power  
  
Well I'm ridin', ridin' on the wind  
Yes I'm ridin', ridin' on the wind  
  
Ri-din', on the wind  
  
Ri-din', on the wind  
  
Ri-din', on the wind  
  
Ri-din' on the wind  
  
Thunderbolt from hell  
Shattering aloud  
Screamin' demons yell  
Bursting through the clouds  
  
Well I'm ridin', ridin' on the wind  
Yes I'm ridin', ridin' on the wind

When the day is over,  
I like to ease my mind  
By jucin' up my system,  
With the beat of a heavy kind  
I smack a bottle open,  
I crank the hi-fi high  
I'm in-a seventh heaven  
Ooh I can touch the sky  
  
I'm in love, so in love  
And I can't stop talking 'bout my rock forever  
  
It's got the movin' to me,  
just that I can't explain,  
It's like a brilliant sunshine,  
After standing in the pouring rain  
My skin begins to tingle,  
Ooh right on down my back.  
It's really got me fevered,  
Pounding my senses flat.  
  
I'm in love, so in love  
And I can't stop talking 'bout my rock forever  
  
Rock rock rock forever (I love my)  
Rock rock rock forever (my fever)  
Rock rock rock forever (always gonna)  
Rock rock rock forever  
I can't stop talkin' about rock  
Now get it right, boys  
  
So when you get those blue days,  
Here's just what to do  
Switch into this lifeline  
And feel it rushing through  
Before you know it, blue days  
Are better left behind  
By juicin' up your system  
With this beat of a heavy kind  
  
I'm in love, so in love  
And I can't stop talking 'bout my rock forever  
Rock forever  
I'm gonna rock forever.

Hey listen don't you let 'em get your mind  
Fill your brain with orders and that's not right  
They're playing at a game that draws you closer  
Till you're living in a world that's ruled by fear  
  
Always takin' baby out that's o.k.  
What they're givin' maybe it's out of phase with me  
Told you once you're never gonna win the race  
Same old no tomorrow kicked in the face  
  
We are screaming for vengeance  
The world is a manacled place  
Screaming, screaming for vengeance  
The world is defiled in disgrace  
  
Tie a blindfold all around your head  
Spin you round in the torture before the dread  
And then you're pushed and shoved into every corner  
Then they lead you out into the final slaughter  
  
As the sweat is running down your neck  
All your praying for's to stop your body breakin' up  
Oh your heart is pumping gonna soon explode  
Got to fight the horror of this mental load  
  
We are screaming for vengeance  
The world is a manacled place  
Screaming, screaming for vengeance  
The world is defiled in disgrace  
  
So you wait it out and bide your time  
Rip off that straight jacket gotta break that line  
Everyone who wins in the great escape  
Leaves a thousand more who suffer in their wake  
  
I don't talk about it but that's alright  
Table's turned now there's a revenge in sight  
If it takes forever babe I tell ya I can wait  
Send them screaming back through their hell's own gate  
  
We are screaming for vengeance  
The world is a manacled place  
Screaming, screaming for vengeance  
The world is defiled in disgrace  

You can look to the left and  
Look to the right  
But you will live in danger tonight  
When the enemy comes he will  
Never be heard  
He'll blow your mind and not say a word  
Blinding lights, flashing colors  
Sleepless nights  
If the man with the power  
Can't keep it under control  
  
Some heads are gonna roll  
Some heads are gonna roll  
Some heads are gonna roll  
Some heads are gonna roll  
  
The power-mad freaks who are  
Ruling the earth  
Will show how little they think you're worth  
With animal lust they'll  
Devour your life  
And slice your word to bits like a knife  
One last day burning hell fire  
You're blown away  
If the man with the power  
Can't keep it under control  
  
Some heads are gonna roll  
Some heads are gonna roll  
Some heads are gonna roll  
Some heads are gonna roll  
  
Know what it's like  
When you're taken for granted  
There goes your life  
It's so underhanded  
If the man with the power  
Can't keep it under control  
  
Some heads are gonna roll  
Some heads are gonna roll  
Some heads are gonna roll  
Some heads are gonna roll

Wild-eyed and tight fisted, I'm fused to the bone  
I stand contemplating, reacting alone  
Impaled with betrayal  
The tourniquet turns  
Society's creation  
Pole-axed out and burnt  
  
Long ago when man was king, his heart was clean now he's stained class  
Time has slashed each untouched thing, so now he's just a stained class king  
  
Transfixed at deliverance, is this all there is  
Faithless continuum, into the abyss  
Fierce is my conviction, absolute my belief  
I spit at you apathy, and seducer deceit  
  
Long ago when man was king, his heart was clean now he's stained class  
Time has slashed each untouched thing, so now he's just a stained class king  
  
Lethal, deadly, hung, drawn and quartered  
He slaughtered and faltered and altered the world  
But by doing so smashed all his hopes and Utopian dreams  
Whipping, stripping, peeling the flesh off, relentless and senseless  
His lust snapped like vipers whose fangs sank in deep  
To infest and decay from the core  
  
Impaled with betrayal, the tourniquet turns  
Society's creation, pole-axed out and burnt  
  
Long ago when man was king, his heart was clean now he's stained class  
Time has slashed each untouched thing, so now he's just a stained class king  
  
Stained class king

Catch the play now, eye to eye  
Don't let chances pass you by  
Always someone at your back  
Biding their time for attack  
  
Check for decoys, stay sharp edged  
Double-crossers get your head  
Carpet-baggers bluff and strike  
Kiss of Judas, spider like  
  
Waiting like jackals to sneak up and trick you  
Wolves in sheeps clothing, slow death in consoling  
Lurking in shadows, they pounce least expected  
When you come to, they'll have gone right through you  
  
Tricksters, jilters play their game  
Sleight-of-handers, all the same  
Masquerader in his lair  
Wants to tangle in your hair  

Holy father drink the fire water  
Preaching peace as you go to war  
Politicians making brave decisions  
Always got self interest at heart  
  
We are to you just a drop in the ocean  
Maybe that's true but it's only a notion  
You integrate with a friendly intrusion  
We won't get fooled we have come to conclusion  
  
Subterfuge deludes the views of you and me  
We're confused but still we choose to disagree  
Subterfuge consumes us but defiantly  
We refuse to bow down to conformity  
  
Evil mothers hiding under covers  
Always near but just out of sight  
  
Hey big brother watch as we recover  
'Cause we'll never give up the fight  
And we say no!  
  
Give us a name and you give us the power  
Watch as we gather our strength by the hour  
You think we're blind and weak in decision  
But we see it all from peripheral vision  
  
Subterfuge deludes the views of you and me  
We're confused but still we choose to disagree  
Subterfuge consumes us but defiantly  
We refuse to bow down to conformity  
  
Somebody wins, somebody lose  
Some call it subterfuge  
Somebody wins, somebody lose  
They fall to subterfuge  
  
Subterfuge deludes the views of you and me  
We're confused but still we choose to disagree  
Subterfuge consumes us but defiantly  
We refuse to bow down to conformity  
  
Somebody wins, somebody lose  
Some call it subterfuge  
Somebody wins, somebody lose  
They fall to subterfuge

You got to leave your seat, you gotta get up upon your feet,  
You're gonna move ya to the rhythm till you never can stop.  
We got the power, we got the music, and you bet that you can use it,  
We're gonna take rock-bottom, we're gonna take it to the top.  
  
Put yourself in our hands, so our voices can be heard,  
And together we will take on all the world.  
Put yourself in our hands, so our voices can be heard,

As we need you, like you need us for sure.  
We're gonna drive you, we're gonna ride you, we're gonna get right inside you,  
And if you wanna keep going, just shout out for more!  
  
Put yourself in our hands, so our voices can be heard,  
And together we will take on all the world.  
Put yourself in our hands, so our voices can be heard,  
And together we will take on all the world.  
  
Sing your song, we'll listen to you.  
Sing your song, the spotlights are you.  
  
Put yourself in our hands, so our voices can be heard,  
And together we will take on all the world.  
Put yourself in our hands, so our voices can be heard,  
And together we will take on all the world.  
  
Put yourself in our hands, so our voices can be heard,  
And together we will take on all the world.  
Put yourself in our hands, so our voices can be heard,  
And together we will take on all the world.  

You're in for surprise  
You're in for a shock  
In London town streets  
When there's darkness and fog  
When you least expect me  
And you turn your back  
I'll attack  
  
I smile when I'm sneaking  
Through shadows by the wall  
I laugh when I'm creeping  
But you won't hear me at all  
  
All hear my warning  
Never turn your back  
On the ripper  
  
You'll soon shake with fear  
Never knowing if I'm near  
I'm sly and I'm shameless  
Nocturnal and nameless  
Except for "The Ripper"  
Or if you like "Jack The Knife"  
  
Any back alley street  
Is where we'll probably meet  
Underneath a gas lamp  
Where the air's cold and damp  
I'm a nasty surprise  
I'm a devil in disguise  
I'm a footstep at night  
I'm a scream of the fright  
  
All hear my warning  
Never turn your back  
On the ripper, the ripper, the ripper

Along deserted avenues  
Steam begins to rise  
The figures primed and ready  
Prepared for quick surprise  
He's watchin' for a sign  
His life is on the line  
Dogs whine in the alleys  
Smoke is on the wind  
From deep inside its empty shell  
A cathedral bell begins to toll  
A storm begins to grow  
  
Amidst the upturned burned-out cars  
The challengers await  
And in their fists clutch iron bars  
With which to seal his fate  
Across his chest is scabbards rest  
The rows of throwing knives  
Whose razor points in challenged tests  
Have finished many lives  
  
Now facing one another  
The stand-off eats at time  
Then all at once a silence falls  
As the bell ceases its chime  
Upon this sign the challengers  
With shrieks and cries rush forth  
The knives fly out like bullets  
Upon their deadly course  
Screams of pain and agony  
Rent the silent air  
Amidst the dying bodies  
Blood runs everywhere  
The figure stands expressionless  
Impassive and alone  
Unmoved by this victory  
And the seeds of death he's sown  
  
Sworn to avenge  
Condemn to Hell  
Tempt not the blade  
All fear the Sentinel

Lay beside me  
Tell me what they've done  
Speak the words I wanna hear  
To make my demons run  
The door is locked now  
But it's open if you're true  
If you can understand the me  
Then I can understand the you  
  
Lay beside me  
Under wicked sky  
The black of day  
Dark of night  
We share this paralyze  
The door cracks open  
But there's no sun shining through  
Black heart scarring darker still  
But there's no sun shining through  
No, there's no sun shining through  
No, there's no sun shining  
  
What I've felt  
What I've known  
Turn the pages  
Turn the stone  
Behind the door  
Should I open it for you?  
  
Yeah  
What I've felt  
What I've known  
Sick and tired  
I stand alone  
Could you be there  
'cause I'm the one who waits for you  
Or are you unforgiven too?  
  
Come lay beside me  
This won't hurt, I swear  
She loves me not  
She loves me still  
But she'll never love again  
She lay beside me  
But she'll be there when I'm gone  
Black heart scarring darker still  
Yes, she'll be there when I'm gone  
Yes, she'll be there when I'm gone  
Dead sure she'll be there  
  
What I've felt  
What I've known  
Turn the pages  
Turn the stone  
Behind the door  
Should I open it for you?  
  
Yeah  
What I've felt  
What I've known  
Sick and tired  
I stand alone  
Could you be there  
'cause I'm the one who waits for you  
Or are you unforgiven too?  
  
Lay beside me  
Tell me what I've done  
The door is closed, so are your eyes  
But now I see the sun  
Now I see the sun  
Yes, now I see it  
  
What I've felt  
What I've known  
Turn the pages  
Turn the stone  
Behind the door  
Should I open it for you?  
  
Yeah  
What I've felt  
What I've known  
So sick and tired  
I stand alone  
Could you be there  
'cause I'm the one who waits  
The one who waits for you  
  
Oh  
What I've felt  
What I've known  
Turn the pages  
Turn the stone  
Behind the door  
Should I open it for you?  
So I dub thee unforgiven  
  
Oh, what I've felt  
Oh, what I've known  
I take this key  
And I bury it in you  
Because you're unforgiven too  
  
Never free  
Never me  
'cause you're unforgiven too

Red light, green light  
I'm coming home tonight  
Burning the freeway  
Out of control  
  
Red light, dead lines  
We streak from town to town  
I's too much, I need your touch  
I've been away too long  
  
Out again upon the thunder road  
Driving back to you where I belong  
I've had enough  
Dreams can wait  
I'm coming home  
  
Spotlights, wild nights  
I know it wrong from right  
Places, the faces  
All look the same  
  
Hot wired, so tired  
Living from song to song  
The madness, the badness  
It's just a game  
  
Watch the sunrise  
From coast to coast  
That's when I need your loving  
Oh! That's when I need it most  
Can't explain, it's something in the blood  
Wouldn't change it even if I could

You won't hear me,  
But you'll feel me  
Without warning, somethings dawning, listen.  
Then within your senses,  
You'll know you're defenseless  
How your heart beats, when you run for cover  
You can't retreat I spy like no other.  
Then we race together.  
We can ride forever  
Wrapped in horsepower, driving into fury  
Changing gear I pull you tighter to me  
I'm your turbo lover  
Tell me there's no other  
I'm your turbo lover  
Better run for cover  
We hold each other closer, as we shift to overdrive  
And everything goes rushing by, with every nerve alive  
We move so fast it seems as though we've taken to the sky  
Love machines in harmony, we hear the engines cry.  
I'm your turbo lover  
Tell me there's no other  
I'm your turbo lover  
Better run for cover  
On and on we're charging to the place so many seek  
In perfect synchronicity of which so many speak  
We feel so close to heaven in this roaring heavy load  
And then in sheer abandonment, we shatter and explode.  
I'm your turbo lover  
Tell me there's no other  
I'm your turbo lover  
Better run for cover  
I'm your turbo lover  
Tell me there's no other  
I'm your turbo lover  
Better run for cover

Why do I have to wait so long  
Before you come into my life again  
Seems as though forever until  
I can be here by your side till then  
  
I think you feel the same way too  
You know you make my dreams come true  
If you'll just turn on your light  
Let me see it shining through the night  
  
When I'm far away from here  
I'll hold all the memories so clear  
If I only have the choice  
I would stay so let me hear your voice  
  
I think you feel the same way too  
You know you make my dreams come true  
If you'll just turn on your light  
Let me see it shining through the night

Change, change, it's all rearrangin'  
Lookin' around at the situation  
Go back, see what you're doin'  
The way you're takin' life, you're goin'  
To rack and ruin  
I'm turning circles, so stay away  
We've all got somethin' wrong to say  
Slow down, see where we're headin'  
The way things are goin' now  
Your life it ain't pleasin'  
Had my share of up and down  
Don't spend time, don't spend time  
Rushin' around.  
I'm turning circles, so stay away  
We've all got somethin' wrong to say.  
Uh-uh uh-uh  
Uh-uh uh-uh  
I'm turning circles, so stay away  
We've all got somethin' wrong to say.  
Uh-uh uh-uh (turning circles)  
Uh-uh uh-uh (stay away)

Behold 'tis I the commander  
Whose grip controls you all  
Resist me not, surrender  
I'll no compassion call  
  
(Tyrant) Capture of humanity  
(Tyrant) Conqueror of all  
(Tyrant) Hideous destructor  
(Tyrant) Every man shall fall  
  
Your very lives are held within my fingers  
I snap them and you cower down in fear  
You spineless things who belly down to slither  
To the end of the world you follow to be near  
  
(Tyrant) Capture of humanity  
(Tyrant) Conqueror of all  
(Tyrant) Hideous destructor  
(Tyrant) Every man shall fall  
  
Mourn for us oppressed in fear  
Chained and shackled we are bound  
Freedom choked in dread we live  
Since Tyrant was enthroned  
  
I listen not to sympathy  
Whilst ruler of this land  
Withdraw your feeble aches and moans  
Or suffer smite from this my hand  
  
(Tyrant) Capture of humanity  
(Tyrant) Conqueror of all  
(Tyrant) Hideous destructor  
(Tyrant) Every man shall fall  
  
Mourn for us oppressed in fear  
Chained and shackled we are bound  
Freedom choked in dread we live  
Since Tyrant was enthroned  
  
My legions faithful unto death  
I'll summon to my court  
And as you perish each of you  
Shall scream as you are sought  
  
(Tyrant) Capture of humanity  
(Tyrant) Conqueror of all  
(Tyrant) Hideous destructor  
(Tyrant) Every man shall fall

Whiskey woman don't you know that you are drivin' me insane  
The liquor you give stems your will to live and gets right to my brain  
Don't you know you're driving me insane  
You're tryin' to find your way through life  
You're tryin' to get some new direction  
Another woman got her man  
She won't find no new connection  
  
Takes another drink or two,  
Things look better when she's through  
  
Takes another look around, you're not goin' anywhere  
You've realized you're gettin' old and no one seems to care  
You're tryin' to find your way again  
You're tryin' to find some new  
Another woman's got her man  
But she won't find a new  
  
Takes another drink or two,  
Things look better when she's through  
  
You 'bin foolin' with some hot guy  
I want to know why is it why  
Get up get out you know you really blew it  
I've had enough, I've had enough, good God pluck me  
  
Once she was wonderful  
Once she was fine  
Once she was beautiful  
Once she was mine  
She was mine  
  
Now change has come over her body,  
She doesn't see me anymore  
Now change has come over her body,  
She doesn't see me anymore  
  
Changes, changes, changes, changes  
Victim of changes

We come in all the glory now  
No prayers suffice such evil foe  
Black wings, the storm is gathering  
And time will say  
We know the power of heresy  
Is on it's way  
  
[Chorus]  
Gods of war  
Heed their warning  
Gods of war  
They are coming now  
  
No man can quell the suffering  
The hell and all the grief it brings  
Our life is almost over now  
there's nothing more  
We feel the pain is everywhere  
It comes and roars  
  
[Chorus]  
Gods of war  
Judge and jury  
Gods of war  
Pain and fury now  
  
We must hold this threat  
From such panic yet  
There will come a time  
When we'll be saved  
Our resilient heart  
To confound defeat yeah!  
  
Out of purgatory  
Unto victory  
We shall overcome  
The war they staged  
Through unyielding power  
In the darkest hour  
They will retreat  
  
[Chorus]  
Gods of war  
Devastation  
Gods of war  
End creation now!

Say you want to rip it up  
Paint the town red  
Wanna do the hot spots  
Get it in the head  
You drive me crazy  
I know your game  
You done it all before  
You'll do it all again  
  
You say yes, I say no  
  
My blood's on fire  
I grit my teeth  
You're nothin' but a teaser  
Gimme some relief  
I'm lookin' at the bottle  
Sinkin' to the floor  
I gotta white knuckles  
Can't take it anymore  
  
You say yes, I say no  
  
What do you treat me so  
What I do, I do for you  

One life I'm gonna live it up  
I'm takin' I said I'll never get enough  
Stand tall I'm uh, young and kind of proud  
I'm on the top, but as long as the music's loud  
  
If you think I'll sit around as the world goes by  
You're thinkin' like a fool cause it's a case of do or die  
Out there is a fortune waiting to be had  
If you think I'll let you go you're mad  
You've got another thing comin'  
You've got another thing comin'  
  
That's right here's where the talking ends  
Well, listen, this night there'll be some action spent  
Drive hard callin' all the shots  
I got an ace card comin' down rocks  
  
If you think I'll sit around while you chip away my brain  
Listen I ain't foolin' and you'd better think again  
Out there is a fortune waiting to be had  
If you think I'll let it go you're mad  
You've got another thing comin'  
You've got another thing comin'  
You've got another thing comin'  
  
In this world we're livin' in we have our share of sorrow  
Answer now and don't give in aim for a new tomorrow  
  
Oh so hot no time to take a rest yeah  
Act tough ain't room for second best  
Real strong got me some security  
Hey, I'm a big smash I'm goin' for infinity yeah!  
  
If you think I'll sit around as the world goes by  
You're thinkin' like a fool cause it's a case of do or die  
Out there is a fortune waiting to be had  
If you think I'll let you go you're mad  
You've got another thing comin'  
You've got another thing comin'  
You've got another thing comin'  
You've got another thing comin'  
You've got another thing ahh  
Comin' down!  
  
If you think I'll sit around while you chip away my brain

You've got another thing comin'

You've got another thing comin'  
You've got another thing comin'  
You've got another thing comin'  
You've got another thing comin'  
You've got another thing comin'  
You've got another thing comin'  
You've got another thing comin'  
You've got another thing comin'  
You've got another thing comin'
