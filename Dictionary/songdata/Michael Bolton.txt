A hundred times I have walked out the door  
Just to walk back a hundred times more  
A thousand nights, I have sworn not to stay, ooh oh  
I remained tangles in the chains of desire, ooh  
I know that it's no good  
I shouldn't be here  
I know I should leave you  
Shouldn't let you close to me  
Shouldn't have this hold on me  
No, I shouldn't be so weak  
But a heart can only be so strong  
Every time I try to go  
Just one look in your eyes I know  
A heart can only be so strong  
A heart can only be  
A hundred ways you have captured my soul  
I can't hold on, but I can't let go  
Your spell on me is a spell I can't break, ooh oh  
All my strength burning in the flames of desire, ooh  
I don't wanna stay here  
I don't wanna leave you  
Don't know how to leave you  
Shouldn't let you close to me  
Shouldn't have this hold on me  
No, I shouldn't be so weak  
But a heart can only be so strong  
Every time I try to go  
Just one look in your eyes I know  
That a heart can only be so strong  
A heart can only be so strong  
(Oh, so strong)  
Oh, so strong  
I can't let go  
So strong, yeah  
'Cause you're a part of my soul  
And I, I can't escape you  
No matter how hard I try  
I can never be free of your hold on me  
(Oh, so strong)  
Oh, I can't let go, oh  
A hundred times, I have walked out the door  
Just to walk back a hundred times more  
Shouldn't let you close to me  
Shouldn't have this hold on me  
No, I shouldn't be so weak  
But a heart can only be so strong  
Every time I try to go  
Just one look in your eyes I know  
(In your eyes I know)  
That a heart can only be so strong  
Shouldn't let you close to me  
Shouldn't have this hold on me  
But a heart can only be so strong  
Every time I try to go  
Just one look in your eyes I know  
(In your eyes I know)  
That a heart can only be so strong  
A heart can only be so strong  
A heart can only be so strong  

The summer sun went down on  
Our love long ago  
But in my heart I feel the same  
Old afterglow  
  
A love so beautiful  
In every way  
A love so beautiful  
We let it slip away  
We were too young to understand  
To ever know  
That lovers drift apart  
And that's the way love goes  
  
A love so beautiful  
A love so free  
A love so beautiful  
A love for you and me  
And when I think of you  
I fall in love again  
A love so beautiful  
In every way  
A love so beautiful  
We let it slip away  
  
And when I think of you  
I fall in love again  
  
A love so beautiful  
We let it slip away  
A love so beautiful  
In every way  
A love so beautiful  
We let it slip away  

Sometimes you find out what you wanted  
Isn't really what you need  
And the dream and all its promise  
Was never meant to be  
All your hopes and desperation  
Won't make it like it was  
And you believe the pain will never end  
Believe me in time it does  
  
[Chorus]  
You've gotta know when love is over  
You've gotta learn to carry on  
And with the world upon your shoulders  
You walk away when hope is gone  
When your golden road has reached the end  
You find a way to start again, you know  
There's a time for love, a time for letting go  
  
When you're standin' tall tomorrow  
Looking back at yesterday  
Through the memory of your sorrow  
How the dawn was so far away  
You'll be far beyond the shadow  
Where hearts can learn to shine  
And you'll realize the endless night  
Was only a moment in time  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The night is long, the night is cold  
With nothing to believe in  
Just hold on 'cause life goes on  
Your new day is waiting  
Let go and let it begin  
  
[Chorus]

Sweet little girl, she's the high school queen  
She lives tonight, in every school boys' dream  
Oh, but nobody knows how she's cryin'  
She's just a child goin' on seventeen  
She gets so confused by her friends and their scenes  
They don't mean what they say  
They don't say what they mean  
She reads the signs, reads between the lines  
But it makes no difference  
There's no reason or rhyme  
Just hold on girl, as long as you can  
In time you'll learn what you don't understand  
It's the human condition, it's the nature of man  
Everybody's crazy, everybody's crazy  
Everybody's crazy, everybody's crazy  
This city boy, he don't want no control  
He just wanna party and play his rock 'n' roll  
But here they come to turn the pressure on  
Say'n son, your partyin' days are gone  
The time has come now to be a man  
Find your place in the world, gotta take what you can  
You've got no ambition, take a look at yourself  
When ya gonna straighten out, be like everybody else  
The boy said listen dad, you're bringin' me down  
I am who I am, I've had a good look around  
There's one thing in the world I can tell you I've found  
Everybody's crazy, everybody's crazy  
Everybody's crazy, everybody's crazy  
There ain't no wonder things are so outta hand  
Sooner or later, ya come to understand  
The human condition, it's the nature of man  
Everybody's crazy, everybody's crazy  
Everybody's crazy, everybody's crazy  

Don't want to lose this feelin'  
It's more than I need to survive  
Just when I stopped believin'  
That's when you came into my life  
  
You turned it around  
Within you I found  
Everything that's real to me  
I'm lost inside your love  
And that's just where I want to be  
  
[Chorus]  
Every time you give your love, it's a fire, it's a miracle  
Every time I feel your love in my life, I know it's a miracle  
You've got the power, you know it  
To touch my every fantasy  
When we make love, you show it  
In everything you give me  
  
So take what you want, take what you will  
You're the one who holds the key  
To open up the door, to reach the deepest part of me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Every time you give your love, it's a fire  
Every time I feel your love in my life, I know it's a miracle  
Every time, every time  
  
Just when I stopped believin', girl, you stepped into my life  
You give me the fire I needed  
It was so hard to find, you're givin' it every time  
  
[Chorus]

Angels heard me callin'  
Saw the mountains crumble  
Fell in love with the wind  
And all the time I spent  
Dreamin' of you  
And all the love we made  
But I never knew I found you  
  
[Chorus]  
I can feel love fallin', fallin'  
I can see it comin', hey  
'Cause heaven sent you down to me  
Heaven sent you down  
  
Oceans re conforming  
To pave the way before me  
Revealing your flawless aura  
I saw your wings unveil, inviting to me  
A world of love  
But I wasn't even looking for ya baby  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You became rain in the air  
When you appeared to me  
Like a love mystery, feels so real to me  
'Cause you came from heaven  
Sent down straight to me  
And there's not another that ya can love  
Oh I can feel it fallin'  
  
CHORUS

  
Fly me to the moon  
Let me play among the stars  
Let me see what spring is like  
On a-Jupiter and Mars  
In other words, hold my hand  
In other words, baby, kiss me  
Fill my heart with song  
And let me sing for ever more  
You are all I long for  
All I worship and adore  
In other words, please be true  
In other words, I love you  
Fly me to the moon  
Let me play among the stars  
Let me see what spring is like  
On a-Jupiter and Mars  
In other words, hold my hand  
In other words, baby, kiss me  
Fill my heart with song  
Let me sing for ever more  
You are all I long for  
All I worship and adore  
In other words, please be true  
In other words, in other words  
  
  

For once in my life I've got someone who needs me, someone I've needed so long  
For once unafraid I can go where life leads me, and somehow I know I'll be  
Strong  
For once I can touch what my heart used to dream of  
Long before I knew someone warm like you  
Could make my dreams come true  
  
For once in my life I won't let sorrow hurt me, not like it's hurt me before  
For once I've got someone I know won't desert me, I'm not alone anymore  
For once I can say: "This is mine you can't take it"  
As long as I've got love I know I can make it

Well it hurt enough  
When you told me you were leaving  
Did you have to go  
And break this heart in two  
By writing me a letter  
I must have read a thousand times  
Saying you'll be back  
When I'm ready to spend  
My life with you  
  
And I'm not ready to settle down  
But for you, maybe I would  
But for you, maybe I could  
So I find myself alone  
By the beach where many nights we stood  
And I think about this life  
I really do live  
But it's hard to change  
A man like me  
Who knows what he wants  
And he knows what he sees  
  
  
And someone like you  
Will take all the love I've got to give  
And I'm not ready to settle down  
But for you maybe I would  
But for you maybe I could  
  
  
So a part of me says, boy  
You're talkin' like a fool  
When you've given all you've got  
To give what they have  
And it's hard to change  
A man like me  
Who knows what he wants  
And he knows what he sees  
  
  
But a love like this  
May never come again I know  
And I'm not ready to settle down  
But for you maybe I would  
But for you maybe I could  
For you maybe, maybe, maybe I would  
Maybe, maybe for you  
Maybe I would  
Maybe I could

I was standing in the moonlight  
With my heart in my hands  
Life had taken me full circle  
And I was meant to love again  
Playing all or nothing  
I'd given up on love, yeah  
Just when I thought  
I'd never fall in love again  
The bough of my heart opened  
And you walked in  
With those......  
Chorus:  
Forever eyes, looking right at me  
Now I find myself believing  
Love will always be  
In your forever eyes  
Never say good-bye  
'cause I only want to lose myself  
In your forever eyes  
  
There were times you'd see right through me  
I'm a child in your hands  
But the moment that you touch me  
You set fire to this man  
Burning inspiration  
That's what I feel right now  
Waves of emotion carry me along  
Your love is like a river  
Going on and on  
In your....  
  
Chorus:  
  
Forever eyes  
  
Chorus:  

How in the hill did this begin  
Like some cruel game we can't seem to win  
It just goes on over and over again  
  
It took the best outta you and me  
I thought we swore we'd let this love rest in peace  
Am I wrong  
Didn't we part as friends  
  
How many lifetimes must we live through  
'Til we're lookin' through the eyes of the truth  
  
We are joined at the soul  
With a heart that don't know how to let go  
What does it mean when it don't mean a thing  
When we say good-bye  
But if life is unkind  
And forever ain't a place we can find  
We'll know how we've tried  
And that forever's just a matter of time  
  
So much love, so much pain  
No one to judge, no one to blame  
It holds on  
How desperate this need that remains  
  
We know the passion that leads us blind  
'Cause the two of us are one of a kind  
  
We are joined at the soul  
With a heart that don't know how to let go  
What does it mean when it don't mean a thing  
When we say good-bye  
But if life is unkind  
And forever ain't a place we can find  
We'll know how we've tried  
And that forever's just a matter of time  
  
Time after time we stumble and fall  
Past the point of no return  
God knows we've given so much more than our all  
To this lesson we may never learn  
  
We are joined at the soul  
With a heart that don't know how to let go  
What does it mean when it don't mean a thing  
When we say good-bye  
But if life is unkind  
And forever ain't a place we can find  
We'll know how we've tried  
And that forever's just a matter of time

Georgia, Georgia, whole day through  
Just an old sweet song  
Keeps Georgia on my mind  
  
Talking 'bout Georgia  
I'm in Georgia  
A song of you  
Comes as sweet and clear as moonlight  
Through the pines  
  
Other arms reach out to me  
Other eyes smile tenderly  
Still in peaceful dreams I see  
The road leads back to you  
  
Georgia, sweet Georgia, no peace I find  
Just an old sweet song  
Keeps Georgia on my mind  
Georgia on my mind  
  
Other arms reach out to me  
Other eyes smile tenderly  
Still in peaceful dreams I see  
The road leads back  
It always leads back, leads back to you  
  
I'm in Georgia, Georgia, sweet Georgia  
No peace, no peace I find  
Just this old sweet song  
Keeps Georgia forever on my mind  
Just an old sweet sweet sweet song  
Keeps Georgia forever on my mind

Nowhere to run I know  
She's got the best of me  
The deed is done, Heaven knows  
She wants the rest of me  
  
It's much too late  
I'm caught up in the fantasy  
There's no escape  
My runnin' days are history  
  
Gina, Gina, girl I surrender  
Gina, Gina, I'm over my head  
Never been in love this way  
Never been in love this way  
  
Been on the loose so long  
Love couldn't hold me down  
The flame in you was so strong  
Girl you turned my heart around  
  
Now I'm losin' sleep  
Can't get you out of my head  
Think I'm in too deep  
I'm a slave to every word that you said  
  
Gina, Gina, girl I surrender  
Gina, Gina, I'm over my head  
Gina, Gina, it's forever  
Never been in love this way  
Never been in love this way  

I have often dreamed, of a far off place  
Where a hero's welcome, would be waiting for me  
Where the crowds will cheer, when they see my face  
And a voice keeps saying, this is where I'm meant to be  
  
I'll be there someday, I can go the distance  
I will find my way, if I can be strong  
I know ev'ry mile, will be worth my while  
When I go the distance, I'll be right where I belong  
  
Down an unknown road, to embrace my fate  
Though that road may wander, it will lead me to you  
And a thousand years, would be worth the wait  
It might take a lifetime, but somehow I'll see it through  
  
And I won't look back, I can go the distance  
And I'll stay on track, no, I won't accept defeat  
It's an uphill slope, but I won't lose hope  
Till I go the distance, and my journey is complete  
  
But to look beyond the glory is the hardest part  
For a hero's strength is measured by his heart  
  
Like a shooting star, I will go the distance  
I will search the world, I will face it's harms  
I don't care how far, I can go the distance  
Till I find my hero's welcome, waiting in your arms  
  
I will search the world, I will face it's harms  
Till I find my hero's welcome, waiting in your arms

Have yourself a merry little Christmas  
Let your heart be light  
From now on our troubles will be out of sight  
  
Have yourself a merry little Christmas  
Make the Yuletide gay  
From now on our troubles will be far away  
  
  
Here we are in the olden days  
Happy golden days of yore  
Faithful friends who are dear to us  
Gather near to us once more  
  
  
Through the years we will all be together  
If the fates allow  
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough  
  
  
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now  
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now

You say you're sure  
You wanna stay with me  
I don't think  
You better play with me  
You fool around I gotta lose  
I don't need it  
  
And pretty soon you want  
Our love to last  
I think your mind  
Has got you moving too fast  
So slow down you can't lose  
You can have it  
Anyway that you choose  
  
Chorus:  
You wanna know  
So I'll tell you to your face  
You don't play with  
Love on the line  
You wanna know  
So I'll tell you to your face  
You don't play with  
This heart of mine  
  
Why don't you come  
Out of your fantasy  
You can't afford to take  
The chance with me  
I'm telling you I can't lie  
I don't need it  
  
So let's forget about  
The rest of you  
'Cause I already know  
The best of you  
You're alright you can't lose  
You can have it  
Anyway that you choose  
(repeat)  
  
You say you're sure  
You wanna stay with me  
I don't think  
You better play with me  
Just slow down you can't lose  
You can have it  
Anyway that you choose  
(repeat 2 times)  
  
This heart of mine

Can you hear me  
Now I've found you  
Standing there in the lonely night  
Many times I  
Tried to reach you  
But you closed your doors  
And you closed them tight  
Come down before it's too late  
Anyone can see you're just  
Looking in your eyes  
Tell me you're satisfied  
With the price you must pay  
Everyday, everyday  
  
Chorus:  
Heart of stone  
Heart of stone  
You can't make it on your own  
Heart of stone  
Heart of stone  
You can't make it all alone  
Breaking this heart of stone  
  
Are you dreaming lost forever  
In the fantasy  
That world of your own  
Time is passing now or never  
Can't you see you're  
A long way from home  
Wake up it's been too long  
Won't you see that  
It can't go wrong  
Just can't understand why  
You make it this way  
Everyday, everyday  
  
Chorus:  
  
Ever wonder whoever thinks it's right  
To fill the empty  
Place inside of you never do  
Ever wonder when you're turning 'round  
If everything you need to know  
Is what you're learning from  
It's to you, yeah, yeah  
  
Chorus:  
  
Heart of stone

I've got sunshine on a cloudy day  
When it's cold outside I've got the month of May  
I guess you'd say  
What can make me feel this way?  
My girl (my girl, my girl)  
Talkin' 'bout my girl (my girl)  
  
I've got so much honey the bees envy me  
I've got a sweeter song than the birds in the trees  
I guess you'd say  
What can make me feel this way?  
My girl (my girl, my girl)  
Talkin' 'bout my girl (my girl)  
  
Hey hey hey  
Hey hey hey  
Ooh  
  
I don't need no money, fortune, or fame  
I've got all the riches baby one man can claim  
I guess you'd say  
What can make me feel this way?  
My girl (my girl, my girl)  
Talkin' 'bout my girl (my girl)  
  
I've got sunshine on a cloudy day  
With my girl  
  
I've even got the month of May  
With my girl

And as I go my way alone  
I find it hard for me to carry on  
I need your warmth, I need your tender touch  
I need the love you know that I mess so much  
  
My world is empty without you babe  
My world is empty without you babe  
  
  
From this whole world I try to hide my face  
But from this loneliness there is no hiding place  
Inside this cold and empty house I dwell  
Here in the darkness, that I know so well  
  
  
My world is empty without you babe  
My world is empty without you babe  
  
  
I need your love now more than before  
I can hardly carry on anymore  
  
  
My mind and soul have felt like this  
Since love between us no more exists  
I need your warmth, I need your tender touch  
I need the love ya know I miss so much  
  
  
My world is empty without you babe  
My world is empty without you babe

So alive when you're near  
Sometimes this pounding in my heart is all that I can hear  
Everyday, every night  
I feel my weakness gettin' stronger  
With each moment passin' by  
  
I keep tryin' to tell my heart  
Just a matter of time till the feeling subsides  
But time doesn't change a thing  
And I want you to know  
That I need you more than ever  
  
[Chorus]  
Never get enough of your love  
It would only take me  
Till the end of forever  
Never get enough of your love  
Heaven knows I've tried  
But I can't get enough of your love  
  
Can't deny what I feel  
The more I fall into this dream, the more I know it's real  
I just run to your touch  
'Cause nothin' else can satisfy this hunger for your love  
  
They say that a time will come when the thrill is gone  
Still it keeps goin' strong  
And time doesn't mean a thing  
'Cause as good as it gets  
Oh, it just keeps gettin' better  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The more I feel, the more I feel about you  
The trouble is I never get enough  
The more I live, the more I just can't live without you  
I can't get enough  
No never enough of your love  
  
[Chorus]

Start spreadin' the news, I'm leavin' today  
I want to be a part of it  
New York, New York  
These vagabond shoes, are longing to stray  
Right through the very heart of it  
New York, New York  
  
I want to wake up, in a city that never sleeps  
And find I'm king of the hill  
Top of the heap  
  
These little town blues, are melting away  
I'll make a brand new start of it  
In old New York  
If I can make it there, I'll make it anywhere  
It's up to you, New York.. New York  
  
New York... New York  
I want to wake up, in a city that never sleeps  
And find I'm A number one, top of the list  
King of the hill, A number one....  
  
These little town blues, are melting away  
I'll make a brand new start of it  
In old New York  
If I can make it there, I'll make it anywhere

Night and day, you are the one  
Only you 'neath the moon or under the sun  
Whether near to me or far  
It's no matter, darling, where you are  
I think of you day and night  
  
Night and day, why is it so  
That this longin' for you follows wherever I go?  
In the roarin' traffic's boom  
In the silence of my lonely room  
I think of you day and night  
  
Night and day, under the hide of me  
There's an, oh, such a hungry yearnin', burnin' inside of me  
And its torment won't be through  
Till you let me spend my life makin' love to you  
Day and night, night and day  
  
Night and day, you are the one  
Only you 'neath the moon or under the sun  
Whether near to me or far  
It's no matter, baby, where you are  
I think of you day and night  
  
Night and day, why is it so  
That this longin' for you follows wherever I go?  
In the roarin' traffic's boom  
Silence of my lonely room  
I think of you day and night  
  
Night and day, under the hide of me  
There's an, oh, such a hungry burning inside of me  
And its torment won't be through  
Till you let me spend life makin' love to you  
Day and night, night and day

I can still remember  
When all I had was time  
A time when I had nothin'  
But this empty heart of mine  
  
When I needed inspiration  
When the night was all I knew  
You were the light shinin' into my life  
The reason for all the love I'm feelin'  
  
[Chorus]  
Now that I've found you  
I don't know how I lived without you  
I don't know how I survived without your love  
Now that I've found you  
I only know I'd be lost without you  
I found the love  
That I'll never find again  
'Cause all I ever needed  
And all I ever wanted  
Has come true  
I found it all now that I've found you  
  
I could've searched forever  
And never realized  
The treasure of a lifetime  
Was the love inside your eyes  
When I reach for inspiration  
In your touch, it's always there  
Givin' me faith every step of the way  
Givin' me all I ever needed  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And every step of the way  
Gonna dedicate my heart to you  
Promise you my world forever  
Pledgin' my love my whole life through

The stars are brightly shining  
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth  
Long lay the world  
In sin and error pining  
Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth  
  
A thrill of hope  
The weary world rejoices  
For yonder breaks  
A new and glorious morn  
Fall on your knees  
Oh, hear the angels' voices  
O night divine  
O night, when Christ was born  
O night divine  
O night, O night divine  
  
A thrill of hope  
The weary world rejoices  
For yonder breaks  
A new and glorious morn  
Fall on your knees  
Oh, hear the angels' voices  
O night divine  
O night, when Christ was born  
O night divine  
O night, O night divine

SYNOPSES  
Mimi and Rodolfo are getting acquainted fast. Outside, Rodolfos' friends call
him to join them. He would rather stay with Mimi, but she shyly suggests they
all go out together. "Tell me you love me," he pleads. She holds back, at
first, but as this duet ends, they sing together for the first time, and their
first word is "Love."  
  
ENGLISH TRANSLATION  
RODOLFO  
Oh! sweet little lady! Oh, sweetest vision,  
With moonlight bathing your pretty face!  
The dream that I see in you is the dream I'll always dream!  
  
MIMI  
(Oh, you rule alone, Love!)  
Deep in my soul trembles the deepest of passions, etc.  
Our kisses shudder with love!  
(How gently now his words of praise make their way  
Into my heart...You rule alone, oh love!)  
No, I beg you! You're mine now! Your friends are still waiting.  
So soon must I leave you? I would like...I can't say it...  
Speak! What if I went along? What? Mimi!  
How sweet instead to stay behind here. It's freezing outside.  
I'd be right beside you! What about later? Who knows, sir?  
Take my arm, my dear young lady...As you say, my dear sir...  
Do you love me, say! I certainly do.  
  
RODOLFO and MIMI  
Love! Love! Love!

People fill their lives, with empty nights,  
And days that slip away  
Some search till the end of time, but never find,  
The open arms of fate  
One moment comes along, someone who's a dream to you,  
All at once your dreams come true  
  
[Chorus:]  
Once in a lifetime, you find the one you really love  
For now and forever, one love that never ends  
Once in a lifetime, when every star that lights the sky  
Will shine with one reason, leading your heart to the one love you find  
Just once in a lifetime  
  
Some people live their lives in compromise,  
And hide their dreams away  
Some never take the chance, within their hands,  
To claim the prize they make  
When faith is all you need, to hold the hand of destiny,  
Find the love that's meant to be  
  
[Chorus]  
If you believe in the power of love  
And you believe that dreams come true  
Magic will fill your heart, when that moment comes along  
Just once in a lifetime  
Once in a lifetime, when every star that lights the sky  
Will shine with one reason, leading you home to the one love you find  
Just once in a lifetime, Just once in a lifetime

Don't look back  
Don't be scared  
We've got dreams and we're still young  
Just think about how far we've come  
  
Think of all  
We have shared  
It's a wonder we survive  
But here we are and we're alive!  
  
Can we hold on, hold on?  
Take a moment to celebrate  
Now before we are gone  
Take a moment to celebrate  
  
There's music in the wind  
Let's dance one more time  
There's a rhythm deep within  
Let's dance one more time  
  
One more time  
Sing the song  
There's a power in our voices  
Hopeful and strong  
  
Years from now  
Somewhere down the line  
We'll remember and we'll all sing  
One more time  
  
[Zulu Chant:]  
See cel la bo lay la

It's beautiful, your honesty  
You cry when you need to  
You say what you feel  
You're never afraid to wear your heart on your sleeve  
You're always so open with me  
  
It's in your voice, I can hear it  
The sound of a woman in love  
  
[Chorus]  
Only a woman can love you so much  
Give you her life and give you her trust  
Not any woman can do what you do  
Only a woman like you  
  
It's magical, your love for me  
It's more than a man could ever receive  
I'm just a man and it's hard to believe  
A woman like you could love me  
  
It's in your eyes, I can see it  
The look of a woman in love  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If only I could find the words to say  
But I just can't, so forgive me  
'Cause you took the words away  
You answered every prayer I always prayed  
  
It's in your touch, I can feel it  
The feeling of a woman in love  
  
[Chorus: x2]

(Werther) (Why do you wake me now?)  
  
Pourquoi me reveiller, o souffle du printemos?  
Sur mon front je sens tes caresses.  
Et pourtant bien proche est le temps  
Des orages et des tristesses.  
Demain, dans le vallon,  
Se souvenant de ma gloire premiere,  
Et ses yeux vainement chercheront ma splendeur:  
Ils ne trouveront plus que deuil et que misere!  
Helas! Pourquoi me reveiller, o souffle du printemps?  
  
Synopses  
Werther is madly in love with Charlotte, his friends wife. To forget her, he
has run away. But when he returns, he finds he is more in love than ever.
Werther recites a favorite poem for Charlotte, and at last realizes that fatal
truth: Charlotte can never return his love.  
  
English translation  
Why do you wake me now, o sweetest breath of spring?  
On my brow I sense your most gentle caress,  
Yet how soon creeps on the time.  
Filled with tempests and with distress!  
Tomorrow through the vale, the traveler will pass,  
Recalling all of the glory of the past.  
And in vain he will search for the bloom of my youth,  
And nothing will he find but deep pain and endless sorrow.  
Alas! Why do you wake me now, o sweetest breath of spring!

Yeah yeah  
Maybe I'm a fool but being foolish gets me closer  
Everything I do is doing anything to hold you  
My heart is on the edge it's true  
But I'll walk out on the ledge for you  
  
Love can be amaze but so amazing when you find it  
Bound to make you crazy til you find yourself inside it  
It's too late now I'm in too deep  
Exactly where I want to be  
  
Cause I'm ready for you  
I'm ready for love  
Willing to take the chance  
And I'm breaking my rules  
So open your heart  
And tell me you'll take my hand  
  
I'm ready for ya  
Ready for you  
I'm ready for ya  
Ready for you  
  
Any kind of fool could see the stars are all aligning  
Baby in your eyes is where I see my future shining  
It's you that I've been waiting for  
Forever I'll be at your door  
  
Cause I'm ready for you  
I'm ready for love  
Willing to take the chance  
And I'm breaking my rules  
So open your heart  
And tell me you'll take my hand  
  
I'm ready for ya  
Ready for you  
I'm ready for ya  
Ready for you  
  
I'm ready to be a part of something stronger than I am  
Gonna give it all gonna risk it all gonna lay it on the line  
It's time to bet my heart on something I'll never understand  
Gonna give it all gonna risk it all  
I surrender to you  
  
Cause I'm ready for you ready for you  
Ready for love  
I'm ready  
C'mon baby take my hand

The people come from all around  
And lay their precious money down  
Satisfaction, guaranteed  
No distractions, all you need  
Spend a weekend in paradise  
Try this on, it's very nice  
You're having fun  
Stick around and we'll sell you the sun  
  
And soon ya learn to play the game  
Ya lose ya win it's all the same  
Catch your dream before it fades  
And join the endless masquerade  
Where pain relievers speak to you  
A make believers dream come true  
You learn so well  
No one not even you can tell  
  
Chorus  
But I really wanna know  
But I really wanna know  
But I really wanna know  
And I've got no choice  
Can ya tell me, what's goin' on  
  
Now every game begins and ends  
And though the player still pretends  
In mausoleums, on painted walls  
The tale of those who'd have it all  
The slave of glory's lost demands  
To always leave with empty hands  
The conqueror  
Tell me what have you come here for  
  
Chorus  
  
This life it is your only friend  
It's whispered in your ear  
In a voice it seems like ages  
You've been waiting so long just to hear  
And suddenly the mystery, and  
Meaning become so clear  
Hold on yesterday's gone  
  
Chorus  
Oh, I really wanna know  
I really wanna know  
I really wanna know  
I really wanna know  
And I've got no choice  
Can you tell me, what's goin' on

(Tosca)(What strange and lovely harmony)  
  
Recondita armonia di belleze diverse!...  
E bruna Floria, l'ardente amante mia.  
E te, beltade ignota, cinta di chiome bionde!  
Tu azzuro hai l'occhio, Tosca ha l'occhio nero!  
L'arte nel suo mistero le diverse belleze insiem confonde:  
Ma nel ritrar costei il mio solo pensiero,  
Ah! Il mio solo pensier, sei tu, Tosca, sei tu!  
  
Synopses  
Cavaradossi is working on a portrait of the Madonna for the church of Saint
Andrea. Though the painting closely resembles a beautiful parishioner there,
Cavaradossi explains that it is a combination of that woman, who he does not
know, and his own dark-haired, dark-eyed lover Floria Tosca.  
  
English translation  
What strange and lovely harmony of such different beauties!  
How dark is Floria, this ardent love of mine.  
And you, mysterious beauty, long and blond flowing tresses  
How your eyes are sky-blue, Tosca's eyes are black-night.  
Art, too, with it's many mysteries, blends all together  
Such different beauties. But though I paint another,  
My only thought is you, oh, my only thought is you,  
Tosca, is you, is you!

Rocky Mountain Way  
  
Spent the last year the Rocky Mountain way  
Couldn't get much higher  
Out to pasture, I think it's safe to say  
It's time to open fire  
'Cause we don't need the ladies  
Cryin' 'cause the story's sad, oh no  
And the Rocky Mountain way  
Is better than the way we had  
  
Tellin' us this and tellin' us that  
Changin' it day by day  
He says it doesn't matter  
Bases are loaded and Casey's at bat  
Changin' it play by play  
It's time to change the batter  
'Cause we don't need the ladies  
Cryin' 'cause the story's sad, oh no  
And the Rocky Mountain way  
Is better than the way we had

In this crazy world  
You can prove that you can make it  
If you're strong enough to take it  
Still there will be times  
When you find this life you're livin'  
Is just takin' all your givin'  
  
When you need someone to run to  
The shelter of my love is always near  
Let me be your cover, whenever darkness falls  
I'll be there, I'll be there  
  
[Chorus]  
'Til the end of the line  
You can count on me baby, call me any time  
When the night is fallin' hard  
Come on out of the rain and into my arms  
Run to me, to a love that's safe and warm  
I'll be yours baby, your safe place fro the storm  
  
People in this world  
Can be blind and so demanding  
Show so little understanding  
And in these desperate times  
Seems like everything's deceivin'  
There ain't much we can believe in  
  
Let me be the one you come to  
Show you one thing, trust is always here  
Let me be your cover, whenever darkness falls  
I'll be there, I'll be there  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Run to me) When those cold and troubled winds have found you  
(Come to me) And I'll wrap my world of love around you  
I'll be your flame burnin' bright  
Be the sunlight in your day  
That'll take you through the night baby  
  
'Til the end of the line  
You can count on me baby, call me any time  
When the night is fallin' hard  
Come on out of the rain and into my arms  
Run to me, to a love that's safe and warm  
I'll be yours baby, your safe place  
I'll be yours baby, your safe place  
I'll be yours baby, your safe place from the storm  
I'll be your safe place from the storm

You are the candle, love's the flame  
A fire that burns through wind and rain  
Shine your light on this heart of mine  
Till the end of time  
You came to me like the dawn through the night  
Just shinin' like the sun  
Out of my dreams and into my life  
You are the one, you are the one  
  
[Chorus]  
Said I loved you but I lied  
'Cause this is more than love I feel inside  
Said I loved you but I was wrong  
'Cause love could never ever feel so strong  
Said I loved you but I lied  
  
With all my soul I've tried in vain  
How can mere words my heart explain  
This taste of heaven so deep so true  
I've found in you  
So many reasons in so many ways  
My life has just begun  
Need you forever, I need you to stay  
You are the one, you are the one  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You came to me like the dawn through the night  
Just shinin' like the sun  
Out of my dreams and into my life  
You are the one, you are the one  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Said I loved you  
But this is more than love I feel inside  
Said I loved you  
But I lied

[Chorus]  
You better watch out  
You better not cry  
You better not pout  
I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
  
He's making a list

gonna find out  
Who's naughty or nice  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
  
He sees you when you're sleeping  
He knows when you're awake  
He knows if you've been bad or good  
So be good for goodness sake  
  
[Chorus]  
  
He sees you when you're sleeping  
He knows when you're awake  
He knows if you've been bad or good  
So be good for goodness sake

I see you finally found a set of rules  
That came inside her game, boy  
You were so young and very proud  
It's hard believin' you're the same, boy  
  
Did she take you so deep into the night  
And promise you a piece of her heart  
Make it feel so good, feel so right  
Then turn around and tear you apart?  
  
[Chorus]  
I know  
She did the same thing  
I know  
She did the same thing  
I know  
She did the same thing to me, oh yeah  
  
She plays upon your dreams and fantasies  
As if she's come to stay there  
But in your life you never dreamed  
You'd find the one who'd know the way there  
  
She'll take you so deep into the night  
And promise you'll be satisfied  
Like a fool you believe all her lies  
Words you'll remember till the end of your life  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
The same thing to me  
She did the same thing to me  
The same thing to me  
I know, I know, I know, I know  
The same thing to me

Well you thought it was over  
But that's not what she told me today  
She said you and your pride  
Man, you let it get in the way  
And if things weren't bad enough  
Well, she told me you were taking  
Her love for granted, oh yeah  
  
Chorus  
She wants you back, she wants you back  
She wants you back, she wants you back  
She wants you back, she wants you back  
Again  
  
Well you're in need of a friend  
And believe me now I happen to be one  
We can sit and pretend  
But I know a good thing when I see one  
Go to her and admit you were wrong  
She'll be there 'cause she knows you belong together  
Oh yeah  
  
Chorus  
  
Go to her and admit you were wrong  
She'll be there 'cause she knows you belong together  
Oh yeah  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh, she wants you back, she wants you back  
She wants you back, she wants you back  
She said she wants you back again  
  
Chorus

You can't deny it  
When that once in your life  
Comes that one of a kind  
  
Once she's inside it  
She can shake up your heart  
She can make up your mind  
  
Everything in your life will change  
When your love is your best friend  
My advice to you is make no mistake  
If ya never want this feelin' to end  
  
[Chorus]  
Show her the way she makes you love her  
Show her the way she makes you feel  
Let your emotions roll like thunder  
You gotta let her know  
You'll never let her go  
Show her the way  
  
Now love is for dreamers  
Funny thing about dreams  
Any moment they're gone  
And love is the teacher  
About makin' it last, about keepin' it strong  
  
Promise the moon and stars  
Swear the best is yet to come  
But promises are not what it takes  
To keep the flame forever young  
  
All you really need to show  
Is everything she needs to know  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Show her, gotta show her, just show her the way(X3)  
Show her the way

Sign your name  
Across my heart  
I want you to be my baby  
Sign your name  
Across my heart  
I want you to be my lady  
  
Time I'm sure will bring  
Disappointments in so many things  
It seems to be the way  
When your gambling cards on love you play  
I'd rather be in Hell with you baby  
Than in cool Heaven  
It seems to be the way  
  
Sign your name  
Across my heart  
I want you to be my baby  
Sign your name  
Across my heart  
I want you to be my lady  
  
Birds never look into the sun  
Before the day is gone  
But oh the light shines brighter  
On a peaceful day  
Stranger blue leave us alone  
We don't want to deal with you  
We'll shed our stains showering  
In the room that makes the rain  
  
All alone with you  
Makes the butterflies in me arise  
Slowly we make love  
And the Earth rotates  
To our dictates  
Slowly we make love  
  
Sign your name  
Across my heart  
I want you to be my baby  
Sign your name  
Across my heart  
I want you to be my lady

Silent night, holy night  
All is calm, all is bright  
'Round yon Virgin Mother and Child  
Holy infant so tender and mild  
Sleep in heavenly peace  
Sleep in heavenly peace  
  
Silent night, holy night  
Shepherds quake at the sight  
Glories stream from Heaven afar  
Heav'nly hosts sing Alleluia  
Christ the Saviour is born  
Christ the Saviour is born  
  
Silent night, holy night  
Son of God, loves pure light  
Radiant beams from Thy holy face  
With the dawn of redeeming grace  
Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth  
Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth

When you just give love  
And never get love  
You'd better let love depart  
I know it's so and yet I know  
I can't get you out of my heart  
  
You made me leave my happy home  
You took my love and now you're gone  
Since I fell for you  
Love brings such misery and pain  
I know I'll never be the same  
Since I fell for you  
  
It's too bad, it's too sad  
But I'm in love with you  
You love me, then you snub me  
Oh, what can I do?  
I'm still in love with you  
  
I guess I'll never see the light  
I get the blues most every night  
Since I fell for you  
Since I fell for you

So you love the way he holds you in the night  
And you believe him when he tells you  
Everything's alright  
But I wonder if you know  
The nature of his game  
And all the others he's been lovin' just the same  
Yeah  
  
CHORUS  
Sooner or later, somebody's gotta let you know  
Sooner or later, somebody's gotta let you know  
It might as well be me  
It might as well be me  
Yeah  
  
  
Promises and plans inside your head  
As you sit alone and think of things he said  
But of all the love you tell me  
You know you've been tastin'  
It's much more than all your time  
I know you've been wastin' babe, yeah  
  
  
CHORUS  
  
  
I hate to be the one to bring you down  
But everybody's talking, it's all over town  
The same old story  
They tell me that's the way it goes  
I'm the first to tell you, now  
And, baby you're the last to know, yeah  
  
  
CHORUS  
Sooner or later, somebody's gotta let you know  
Sooner or later, somebody's gotta let you know

We may be strangers  
We may be worlds apart somehow  
And it's hard to accept  
The things we just don't understand  
So blind to each other  
We only see one side of nowhere  
Some things we may never know  
If there's one thing you should ever know  
  
Soul of my soul, heart of my heart  
The greatest treasure of my life that's what you are  
Soul of my soul, child of my heart  
I love you more than you know, soul of my soul  
  
Into this world  
We come with a heart that's open wide  
And the best of this life  
Is all I ever want for you  
The love you believe in, your every dream  
Your every passion  
In time I know you'll come to see  
Nothin' means as much to me  
  
Soul of my soul, heart of my heart  
The greatest treasure of my life that's what you are  
Soul of my soul, child of my heart  
I love you more than you know, soul of my soul  
  
There'll come a time when you'll be on your own  
But in your heart you're never far from home  
Eery road you take  
Your ever living day  
You will always be, you will always be  
The soul of my soul  
  
Soul of my soul, heart of my heart  
The greatest treasure of my life that's what you are  
Soul of my soul, child of my heart  
I love you more than you know, soul of my soul  
  
Soul of my soul, heart of my heart  
Some kind of miracle of my life that's what you are  
Blood of my blood, light of my life  
You mean much more than you know  
Soul of my soul

Talk about love, talk about trust  
Talkin' 'bout forever baby  
When I'm talkin' 'bout us  
  
I give you my word, stick to my guns  
Believe me when I tell ya baby  
That we've just begun  
  
You don't understand, no  
The full intent of my plan  
  
[Chorus]  
I want to be your soul provider  
I want to stay that way  
For the longest time  
I want to be, your sould provider  
Justsay you'll let me  
And darlin' I will  
  
I know you've been hurt, I know you're love shy  
You don't have to say it baby  
It's gonna take some time  
Ya got my heart, in the palm of your hand  
Swear it's gonna stay there baby  
Give me half a chance  
  
You don't understand  
The full intent of my plan  
  
I've been waitin' for a long time for somebody like you  
To give my love, all my love day and night  
Just say you'll be mine for the rest of your life  
Baby I'll show you why  
  
[Chorus]

Baby, we've been in and out of love so many times  
We keep reaching the end of the line and giving up on each other  
And, darling, I don't think we can survive one more goodbye  
Can't cry one more tear or lie one more lie  
We got one last chance to make it  
But that's all we need if we just take it  
  
[Chorus]  
Baby, we gotta stand up for love, gotta hold on  
'Cause I know what we got is worth fighting for  
And I know for sure, right or wrong, this is where we belong  
Baby, this time we gotta stand up for love, stand together  
Can't settle for less than forever  
I know there's nothing we can't rise above  
If we just stand up for love  
  
Baby, after everything we put each other through  
And no matter what damage we do, we still need one another  
And sometimes when I hold you in my arms, somehow I see  
As bad as we've been that's how good we can be  
But we can't just say we want it  
Gotta lay all our tomorrows on it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
For all the dues we've paid  
The magic we two have made  
For all we've meant to one another  
Once and for all we've gotta stand up for each other  
  
Baby, we gotta stand up for love, gotta hold on  
'Cause we know what we got is worth fighting for  
And we know for sure, right or wrong  
Baby, this time we gotta stand up for love, now or never  
Can't settle for less than forever  
I know there's nothing we can't rise above  
If we just stand up for love

As I search this heart of mine  
For words to tell you  
If you give me time I swear  
I'll find a way  
How I've come to feel about you  
I couldn't think of life without you  
These words could never say  
  
Like a fool I let my pride mislead me  
In this world I call myself a man  
But without your love to guide me  
Who could ease the pain inside me  
Somethin' only you could understand  
  
  
CHORUS  
Stay, please stay  
Oh stay, please stay  
'Cause I need you by my side  
On this long and lonely ride  
And there's so much I would give you  
If you'd stay  
  
  
So I search this heart of mine  
For words to tell you  
If you give me time I swear  
I'll find a way  
How I've come to feel about you  
I couldn't think of life without you  
What I'm feeling now  
These words could never say  
  
  
CHORUS  
Stay, please stay  
Oh stay, please stay  
Oh, I need you by my side  
On this long and lonely ride  
And there's so much I would give you  
If you'd stay  
There is so much I would give you  
If you'd stay  
I've got so much love to give you  
If you'd stay  
  
  
Please stay

The summer wind  
Came blowin' in from across the sea  
It lingered there  
To touch your hair and walk with me  
All summer long we sang a song  
Then we strolled that golden sand  
Two sweethearts and the summer wind  
  
Like painted kites  
Those days and nights they went flyin' by  
The world was new  
Beneath a blue umbrella sky  
Then softer than a piper man  
One day it called to you  
I lost you  
I lost you to the summer wind  
  
The autumn wind and the winter winds  
They have come and gone  
And still the days  
Those lonely days they go on and on  
And guess who sighs his lullabies  
Through nights that never end  
My fickle friend, the summer wind  
  
The summer wind  
Warm summer wind

I said a lot of things  
A lot of things I didn't mean to say  
Never meant to hurt you  
I was wrong to fight with you that way  
But I'm only human  
I let my pride deceive me  
You're the lover I need in my life  
If you still don't believe me  
  
Baby take a look at my face  
Tell me you don't see what you started  
No one's gonna take your place  
Right here by my side  
Baby take a look at my face  
You're never gonna be broken-hearted  
If you still don't know what you mean to me  
Take a look at my face  
  
From the day I found you  
You brought light into my heart  
So don't keep your love away from me  
Don't leave me in the dark  
Though I never tell you  
What my heart's concealing  
You're the lover I need in my life  
Can't you feel what I'm feeling  
  
Baby take a look at my face  
Tell me you don't see what you started  
No one's gonna take your place  
  
Baby take a look at my face  
You're never gonna be broken-hearted  
If you still don't know what you mean to me  
Take a look at my face  
  
You could think it over  
You could make it easy  
I'm the lover you need in your life  
If you still don't believe me  
  
Baby take a look at my face  
Tell me you don't see what you started  
No one's gonna take your place  
Right here by my side  
Baby take a look at my face  
You're never gonna be broken-hearted  
If you still don't know what you mean to me  
Take a look at my face  

Woman, you don't understand  
Oh, I'm just a man  
Baby, that's all I am  
That's all I have ever been  
And you, you don't understand  
Oh, I've gotta live  
  
You make it so hard to do  
You know you hurt me, baby  
Take me, take me as I am  
Take me as I am, baby  
Oh, oh, take me as I am  
  
All I believe is that you've taken me  
For some kind of dream  
I don't want to wait too long  
For my love is in the way to see it  
I don't want to lose you, baby  
But your love is in the way  
  
You gotta listen  
It's time to listen to me  
You, you don't realize  
Oh, I've gotta live  
You make it so hard to bear  
It may be hard for me to go on  
  
And I know, I know, I know  
You'll understand  
I'm just a man, baby  
That's all I am  
Don't make it hard on me  
  
Just take me, take me as I am, baby  
Take me as I am, baby  
Take me as I am, oh  
Take me as I am, baby  
Oh, take me as I am now

That's life (that's life)--that's what all the people say  
You're ridin' high in April, shot down in May  
But I know I'm gonna change that tune  
When I'm back on top, back on top in June  
  
I said that's life (that's life), and as funny as it may seem  
Some people get their kicks stompin' on a dream  
But I don't let it, let it get me down  
'Cause this fine old world it keeps spinnin' around  
  
I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet, a pawn, and a king  
I've been up and down and over and out, and I know one thing  
Each time I find myself flat on my face  
I pick myself up and get back in the race  
  
That's life (that's life)--I tell you I can't deny it  
I thought of quitting, baby, but my heart just ain't gonna buy it  
And if I didn't think it was worth one single try  
I'd jump right on a big bird and then I'd fly  
  
I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet, a pawn, and a king  
I've been up and down and over and out and I know one thing  
Each time I find myself layin' flat on my face  
I just pick myself up and get back in the race  
  
That's life (that's life), that's life and I can't deny it  
Many times I thought of cuttin' out, but my heart won't buy it  
But if there's nothin' shakin' come this here July  
I'm gonna roll myself up in a big ball and die  
  
My, my

I've got this somethin' to tell you  
There ain't no doubt in my mind  
All I'm askin' is to keep you near forever  
Just till the end of time  
  
Baby, I know where love grows  
My heart is overflowin'  
You're so fine and so true  
I want to spend my time, spendin' time with you, baby  
  
I've got the best of love  
With every breath and every beat of my heart  
You know you've got me by my deepest emotion  
'Cause you keep givin' me the best of love  
  
Passion and sweet inspiration  
So rare and so hard to find  
You are my journey and my destination  
Queen of this heart of mine  
  
Baby, I know where love grows  
In my life it's overflowin'  
You're so fine and it's so true  
I know I've got it all, all because of you, baby  
  
I've got the best of love  
With every breath and every beat of my heart  
You know ya reach into my deepest emotion  
And you keep givin' me, the best of love  
  
With every moment that passes by  
This love goes on  
It keeps growin' stronger  
And the more we're together  
The best keeps gettin' better, baby  
  
I've got the best of love  
With every breath and every beat of my heart  
You know you're down inside my deepest emotion  
So just keep givin' me, the best of love  
  
I've got the best of love  
With every breath and every beat of my heart  
Ain't nothin' finer than that sweetest emotion  
Just keep givin' me, just keep on givin' me  
The best of love, best of love, best of love

As I'm looking back in time  
My heart was young and the world was mine  
Driven by desires blind  
I remember someone told me as the years roll by  
Remember one thing, the one thing  
People come and people go  
The way the winds of fortune blow  
So hard to find that heart of gold  
I remember someone told me  
When you find it, don't let go  
  
[Chorus]  
You're the one thing, you're the one thing, baby  
Makes this world heaven  
Makes the whole thing right  
You're the one thing  
That means something, baby  
The one I believe in  
The one thing I need in my life  
  
As I look into your lovin' eyes  
There ain't no doubt just where my treasure lies  
I've searched the earth for somethin' true  
But the only truth that matters is my love for you  
  
And that's the one thing, the one thing  
Timeless as the stars, faithful as the sea  
Like the endless risin' sun, I know you'll be there for me  
There's so much love inside, this heart of mine could break  
'Cause I know I've found forever and with every breath I take  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And your love is like a rainbow  
In a world that's black and white  
You paint my dreams in color  
And in your arms they come alive  
You're my every inspiration  
You're the wings that make me fly  
You're my only destination  
You're the one thing, the one thing in my life, oh  
You're the one thing, you're the one thing, baby  
  
[Chorus]

(with Nicollette Sheridan)  
  
There are those who'll bet love comes but once, and yet  
I'm oh, so glad we met the second time around  
  
Love is lovelier the second time around  
Just as wonderful with both feet on the ground  
It's that second time you hear your love song sung  
Makes you think perhaps that love, like youth, is wasted on the young  
  
Love's more comfortable the second time you fall  
Like a friendly home the second time you call  
Who can say what brought us to this miracle we've found?  
There are those who'll bet love comes but once, and yet  
I'm oh, so glad we met the second time around  
  
Love is lovelier the second time around  
Just as wonderful with both feet on the ground  
Who can say what brought us to this miracle we've found?  
There are those who'll bet love comes but once, and yet

Your heart is my need  
And I love what it means to succeed  
As your fate is my prize  
Love you're breathe in me  
It's what keeps me alive  
Hold on 'till forever is gone  
Hold on to whatever it takes  
To go on and on and on, oh baby  
  
This is the way that we live  
This is the world where our dreams survive  
Fight for the love that we give  
The love that we make is all in the way that we live  
The way that we live  
  
In my dreams I can fly  
In your arms, there's no earth, no sky  
There's one truth, no lies  
There's no distance between us  
Just trust in our lives  
Hold on 'till forever is gone  
Hold on to whatever it takes to go on and on, oh baby  
  
This is the way that we live  
This is the world where our dreams survive  
Fight for the love that we give  
The love that we make is all in the way that we live  
The way that we live, the way that we live  
  
In our lives there's so much useless information  
The truth is as simple as the air that we breathe  
So many souls with the need for human affirmation  
You and I choose to believe we are free!  
  
This is the way that we live  
This is the world where our dreams survive  
Fight for the love that we give  
The paths that we take it's all in the way that we live  
This is the way that we live  
This is the world where our dreams survive  
Fight for the love that we give  
This is the way that we live

Oh this river, oh this river runs  
Can't take my heart away from you  
You are in my soul  
Can't tame this love I feel for you  
Can't escape what is meant to be  
It's endless as the heavens  
It's timeless and it's strong  
It's faithful as an angel  
It's right there right or wrong  
There's no end to this emotion  
It goes on and on  
  
[Chorus]  
This river runs, this river runs so true  
This river runs, this river runs to you  
This river's deep as the ocean  
Runs on blind emotion  
This river runs, oh yeah  
  
You're every beat within my heart  
You are in my blood  
Nothing could keep me from your arms  
Where you are is where I'll always be  
As long as there are mountains  
And stars still fill the sky  
As long as there's forever  
I'm right here by your side  
There's no end to this emotion  
Till the end of time  
  
[Chorus]  
  
This river runs, oh so deep within my soul  
And it flows forever  
And for the rest of all time  
Always be there  
  
[Chorus]

Now there's something my daughter  
That I need to tell you  
And there's no easy way on your heart  
The truth is your mother and I have decided  
We're better off living apart  
But nothin's gonna change between you and me  
We'll only grow stronger in time  
As sure as the river will run to the sea  
You can always come runnin' to this love of mine  
  
Til the end of forever  
The last day of never  
And through all of your life in this world  
Promise me you'll always remember  
My love will follow you anywhere  
Til The end of forever I promise I'll always be there  
  
We'll look back at the pieces  
That we put together  
And the puzzle will mean so much more  
I'll be right where ya found me  
Wrapped round your finger  
Like I've been since the day you were born  
  
And who'll walk beside you  
When ya walk down the aisle  
When true love is takin' your hand  
When you're lost in the eyes, of your own child  
You'll remember this moment and you'll understand  
  
Til the end of forever  
The last day of never  
And through all of your life in this world  
Promise me you'll always remember  
My love will follow you anywhere  
Til The end of forever I promise I'll always be there  
  
Spread the wings of your dreams  
That's my only prayer  
To Love every moment from sunrise to sunset  
In your heart is my heart, I will be there  
  
Promise me you'll always remember  
My love will follow you anywhere  
Til the end of forever I promise  
Til the end of forever I promise  
As God is my witness I promise I'll always be there  
  
So promise you'll always remember I'll always be there

Time is on my side, yes, it is  
Time is on my side, oh yes, it is  
'Cause I got the real love  
The kind that you need  
So you'll come runnin' back  
That you'll come runnin' back  
You'll come runnin' back to me  
  
Time is on my side, yes, it is  
Time is on my side, oh yes, it is, baby  
'Cause you always said  
That you want to be free  
But you'll come runnin' back  
You'll come runnin' back  
You'll come runnin' back to me, to me  
  
Go ahead, go ahead and lie to me, baby  
And do anything that you want to do  
And I told ya, ya know I told ya so many times before  
You're gonna come back, baby  
You're gonna come back  
Knockin' at my door  
  
Time is on my side, yes, it is  
Time is on my side, oh yes, it is  
'Cause I got the real love  
The kind that you need  
So you'll come runnin' back  
That you'll come runnin' back  
You'll come runnin' back to me, to me, to me  
  
Oh, time is on my side  
You know it is  
Time is on my side, yes, it is  
Time is on my side, yes, it is

I'm so tired of being alone  
I'm so tired of on-my-own  
Won't you help me, girl?  
Just as soon as you can  
People say that I've found a way  
To make you say that you love me  
Hey, baby, you didn't go for that  
It's a natural fact  
That I wanna come back  
Show me where it's at, baby  
I'm so tired of being alone  
I'm so tired of on-my-own  
Won't you help me, girl?  
Soon as you can  
I guess you know that I, uh, I love you so  
Even though you don't want me no more  
Hey, hey, hey, hey, I'm cryin' tears  
All through the years  
I'll tell ya like it is  
Honey, love me if you will  
Yeah, baby  
Tired of being alone here by myself now  
I tell ya, I'm tired, baby  
I'm tired of being all wrapped up late at night  
In my dreams, nobody but you, baby  
Sometimes I wonder  
If you love me like you say you do  
You see, baby, I been thinkin' about it, yeah  
I been, I been wantin' to get next to you, baby  
Ya see, sometimes I hold my arms  
I say mmm hmm hmm  
Yeah, baby  
Meeting you has proven to me  
To be my greatest dream, yeah  
Tired, baby  
Yeah, you don't know what I'm talkin' about  
Sometimes late at night I get to wonderin' about you, baby  
Oh, baby, baby  
I'm so tired of being alone  
I'm so tired of being alone  
I'm so tired of being alone

There's a light  
A certain kind of light  
That never shone on me  
I want my life to be  
Lived with you, lived with you  
There's a way  
Everybody say  
To do each and every little thing  
But what does it bring  
If I ain't got you, ain't got you?  
  
[Chorus]  
You don't know what it's like  
Baby, you don't know what it's like  
To love somebody, to love somebody  
The way I love you  
  
In my mind  
I see your face again  
I know my frame of mind  
You ain't got to be so blind  
And I'm blind, so very blind  
I'm a man  
Can't you see what I am?  
I live and breathe for you  
But what good does it do  
If I ain't got you, ain't got you?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh yeah  
You don't know what it's like  
Baby, you don't know what it's like  
To love somebody, to love somebody  
To love somebody, oh yeah  
  
To love somebody  
The way I love you  
You don't know, you don't know  
To love somebody, to love somebody  
You don't know, oh  
To love somebody, to love somebody  
The way I love you

(L'elisir d'amore)(One tear that falls so furtively)  
  
Una furtiva lagrima  
Negl'occhi suoi spunto:  
Quelle festose giovani  
Invidiar sembro.  
Che piu cercando io vo?  
Che piu cercando io vo?  
M'ama, si m'ama, lo vedo, lo vedo.  
Un solo instante I palpiti  
Del suo bel cor sentir!  
I miei sospir, confondere  
Per poco a' suoi sospir!  
I palpiti, I palpiti sentir,  
Confondere I miei coi suoi sospir  
Cielo, si puo morir!  
Di piu non chiedo, non chiedo.  
Ah! Cielo, si puo, si puo morir,  
Di piu non chiedo, non chiedo.  
Si puo morir, si puo morir d'amor.

poor boys like him. Desperate, he buys a "Love potion" that only turns out to

English translation  
One tear that falls so furtively  
From her sweet eyes has just sprung,  
As if she envied all the youths  
Who laughingly passed her right by.  
What could I want more than this?  
She loves me! I see it.  
One moment just to hear her heart,  
Beating so close next to mine,  
To hear my sighs like they were hers,  
Her sighings as if they were mine!  
Heavens, please take me now:  
All that I wanted is mine now!

Now she's gone from my life  
And it nearly drove me out of my mind  
Always thinking what she meant to me  
All we left behind  
Can't be afraid, startin' over  
When you're drownin' in your loneliness  
The hurtin' never ends  
And the night rolls on  
I search for some peace of mind  
No, I can't be wrong  
Won't get burned by desire this time  
  
Gonna wait on love  
Holdin' out till I find the one  
Wait on love, won't hold back  
I promised myself, till it comes  
Gonna wait on love  
  
Wanna get close with somebody  
When a voice says I'm movin' too fast  
It's hard to know when to walk away  
Or try to make it last  
Still the night rolls on  
Secrets are safe in the dark  
And I stayed too long  
I'm not gonna lie to my heart  
  
Gonna wait on love  
Holdin' out till I find the one  
Wait on love, won't hold back  
I promised myself, till it comes  
Gonna wait on love  
  
Someone I can run to  
Just know that it's right  
Trust my heart and soul to  
For the rest of my life  
  
Gonna wait on love  
Holdin' out till I find the one  
Wait on love, won't hold back  
I promised myself, till it comes  
Gonna wait on love  

It's over now, gotta face it one last time  
We'll never make it work, heaven knows we tried  
Living this life, holdin' on for so long  
I know it won't be easy, but it's time to be strong  
  
Chorus:  
Walk away, walk away  
Don't you wait a minute longer  
Walk away from the love we know is wrong  
Walk away, walk away  
Do it now while I can find the strength to say  
Leave me now, before my heart won't let you  
Walk away  
  
You and I, never wanted it to end  
Just have to find a way, to start livin' again  
Oh, love of my life, I don't want to let you go  
Leave behind the memories, a forever that we'll never know  
  
Chorus:  
  
Ya know we can't go on, ya know the reason why  
That don't make it any easier, when it comes to saying  
Good-bye  
Walk away, walk away  
Do it now while I can find the strength to say  
Leave me now  
Before my heart won't let you...  
  
Chorus:

Here we are, just goin' through the motions one more time  
You look into my eyes, but you don't see me  
Here I am, feelin' like a stranger in your arms  
I touch you, I hold you, but lately I don't know you  
  
Something is wrong but we go on from day to day  
And we just pretend it all away  
We act like nothing's changed  
But in our hearts we know, it's not the same  
  
Chorus  
'Cause we're not makin' love anymore  
Baby, we're not makin' love like before  
We may hold each other tight  
Say that everything's alright  
But we're not makin' love  
  
Remember when, you couldn't wait to run into my arms  
When the love inside my heart was all you needed  
Remember when, you made me wish the night would never end  
The fire, the thunder, we lived to love each other  
  
If ever two hearts were one, then it was your and mine  
But that was another place in time  
Now all we have to show  
Are memories of a dream we used to know  
  
Chorus  
  
When did we lose our way, we had it all  
Don't know how it all just slipped away  
But oh, can we get it back again  
Is it too late, can we try, just one time, 'Cause darling....  
  
Chorus  
  
We're not makin' love anymore  
Baby we're not makin' love like before  
Can we find a way to try  
Find the magic one more time  
'Cause we're not makin' love

What are you doing the rest of your life?  
North and South and East and West of your life  
I have only one request of your life  
That you spend it all with me  
All the seasons and the times of your days  
All the nickels and the dimes of your days  
Let the reasons and the rhymes of your days  
All begin and end with me  
I want to see your face in every kind of light  
In the fields of dawn and the forests of the night  
And when you stand before the candles on a cake  
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make  
Those tomorrows waiting deep in your eyes  
In the world of love that you keep in your eyes  
I'll awaken what's asleep in your eyes  
It may take a kiss or two  
Through all of my life  
Summer, Winter, Spring, and Fall of my life  
All I ever will recall of my life  
Is all of my life with you

I guess you wonder where I've been  
I searched to find the love within  
I came back to ley you know  
Got a thing for you  
And I can't let go  
  
My friends wonder what is wrong with me  
Well I'm in a daze from your love you see  
I came back to let you know  
Got a thing for you  
And I can't let go  
  
Some people go around the world for love  
And they may never find what they dream of  
What you won't do, do for love  
You tried everthing  
But you don't give up  
In my world only you  
Make me do for love  
What I would not do  
  
My friends wonder what is wrong with me  
Well I'm in a daze from your love you see  
I came back to let you know  
Got a thing for you  
And I can't let go  
  
And though I only want the best it's true  
I can't believe the things I do for you  
  
What you won't do, do for love  
You've tried everything  
But you won't give up  
In my world only you  
Make me do for love  
What I would not do
