Hey kiss me I kiss you  
Kiss me I kiss you  
I know about you  
I've been told about you  
I've been waiting for you  
And the air's thin  
Tiny holes  
  
And everybody wants to know you  
Is rapt like moon river  
Then beyond the blinds  
The new white slacks alight  
Sliding into the city  
Tunnel beneath the feet of the people in the city  
Roamin' roamin' roamin' in the city  
And crossway boy  
Crossway boy  
Downtown waterfront boy  
And the shadows where the ambi and the motor meet  
And she's on the phone again  
Surfin' she's on the phone again  
She's calling from America  
She's calling from America  
She's surfin' she's moshing  
And the girls are diving and the girls are up to something  
Animal boy thing up on the roof again  
Boy thing lookin'down there  
And there's every kind of lack  
To make it down to the Delaware  
And up in your head  
And moaner moaner moaner moaner  
Rudy get the get the get the get the get the  
Night the city loves you  
City loves a boyfriend  
Love walks with a boyfriend  
A city loves a boyfriend  
Friends walking with a boyfriend  
And the night's with a boyfriend  
And the city loves you loves you loves you  
Loves everyone  
Everyone is smiling  
The smiling is pushing it around  
It's pushing it around  
Like shadows in the evolution in the dark  
And the super boys  
Where time is all where time is everything  
Where time of all this started  
As we're turned to earth earth wind and fire  
Get the sound in your head  
Black metal walls are crawling  
I am the hunger above your town  
A little sound in a little amp  
I am dubious hard metal I am stainless  
I am milk in your plastic  
I am wrapped in this left alone  
In a full moon with  
The only thing I can do  
Lying awake on the floor  
At night the doors I can't I can't awake I can't awake  
Ah ah ah ah  
Water into you to me constantly  
Constantly  
Without without without without again without again  
Your telephone number  
Through the glass of water  
The instance between is opened  
The silence is indifferent and your love love love  
Love walks with the boyfriend  
The city loves a boyfriend  
Friends walking  
Friends walking with a boyfriend  
The city loves a boyfriend  
Everybody loves a boyfriend  
You left me alone you left me alone  
With a full moon  
Full moon full moon full moon full moon full moon  
Boys boys boys boys  
Cross crossway crossway boy  
Down on the waterfront

Pray for me  
As you would a child  
In a land of oppression  
  
Millions cry around the world  
But I cry in your back garden  
  
Pray for me  
And I'll pray for you  
It's no revolution  
But it's somethin' -  
Somethin' we can do!  
  
Pray all the day  
All the -  
All the day  
All the day  
  
Pray for me  
As you do for peace  
In a world of aggression  
Hear me!  
Must it make the news  
For us to show some affection  
  
Pray for me  
And I'll pray for you  
It's no revolution  
But it's somethin' -  
Somethin' we can do!  
  
Pray all the day  
All the -

Tina lives in Berlin  
Her voice so seldom  
On my machine  
Is here tonight  
And I'm on the market  
And when I'm on a market  
Words move faster  
Wire and clouds move  
Thin between us  
Like a skin  
Like a salty skin  
For a seed  
A fat circles  
A smiling smiling  
Her voice so intentionally  
Smiling  
And a cloud between us  
And these are my intentions  
Pushing [Repeat x7]  
Push  
Ah [Repeat x10]

Is carrying something

And someone I used to be  
Great plastic someone  
Blue plastic girl  
Your dream is  
Pushing [Repeat x5]  
Pushed away your body is  
Pushing [Repeat x3]  
Pushed away your  
Come me for the unbelieve

Lipstick fodder

Between the holes of sheets  
Is professionally poised  
Faces watching her  
She's watching the faces  
Watching her

Listening to a whisper  
  
To touch to taste  
You flow like a river of bass vibration

Wait you've gone too far  
Who for God's sake who for God's sake  
Who is it you think you are  
You know you should, should, shoulda known better  
Than take a chance  
If you can't feel the rhythm  
If you can't feel the rhythm don't dance!  
  
You can't run  
You can't hide  
On the wings of a dove  
Or behind your vicious pride (you better come through it)  
  
Hey  
You gotta silver tongue  
You use it and you use it  
And you'll get us all hung  
You know you should, should, shoulda known better  
Than take a chance  
'Cause if you can't feel the rhythm  
If you can't feel the rhythm don't dance!  
  
You can't run  
You can't hide  
On the wings of a dove  
Or behind your vicious pride (you better come through it)  
  
Show me show me some emotion  
Show me show me some emotion

Do you still feed the animal  
Animal finger  
Finger on the phone  
Curve around corners  
Do you still feed the animal  
Your muffled voices  
Up this ideal head  
And the wires come in  
Open us  
Close us  
(slide beneath the city)  
Slide beneath the city  
And the feet in the streets above us  
(and your voice again)  
And your voice again  
(and your voice again)  
(and your voice again)  
I don't want you to call again  
Do you still feed the animal  
Muffled madness  
Quiet calm pervade her  
I couldn't go through this again  
You said you love her  
You know you love her  
You never want to be without her  
You said you never want hurt her  
You know you hurt her  
I  
How many lives you lives  
How many hurt you done  
How many times you come to this place  
How much you want it  
You said you love her

Pull up a chair and unwind  
Dog we don't share  
The taxi left us behind  
Silhouette of a psychic reader in the market  
And the straw wrapped around a bottle to take home  
Barbecue chicken oil in a drum, double strong wrong  
Here comes the horn you call for  
Woman in a box with her head in her box  
Speaks french when spoken like a tourist french  
Hey classic coca-cola in a can when you want to cool down  
Heat, she move up the street in waves  
Sugar, sugar, clear your mind leave it all behind  
Get in the boat and float  
Join in on a high spot and ride, ride  
Put on some smile  
Stay for a while

Stay there  
I'm having a whinge  
A winjer  
Today  
Today  
I could be a diamond  
I brought anything  
On a winjer  
Having a whinge  
Everything  
Everything looks miserable  
When you're the winjer  
Opinion in the house a flame  
When you're the winjer  
I'm having a laugh  
I'm having a laugh  
With the roof off and the sunlit  
Take your top off  
Take your  
Take your top off  
You look happy now  
You look happy now  
No spikes  
Having a laugh  
Warm grass around you  
Warm grass around you  
Warm grass around you  
On a winjer  
Today could be a diamond  
I could be a diamond  
About anything  
Everything looks miserable  
When you're the winjer  
I'm I'm I'm  
I'm having a laugh  
With the roof off  
And the sunlit  
Take your top off  
Take your top off  
Bird in the hall moonlight  
Follows the road  
Warm grass around you  
Warm grass around you  
Stay there
