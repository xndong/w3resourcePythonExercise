Six months later when we going strong  
Who would have thought weakened baby girl clickin like a metronon  
Now I was wrong when I said I was gon hit it and quit it  
'cause baby girl got me fiendin and I got to admit it  
You think I mean it  
I love the way she do her thang  
Keep me comin back to her like a boomerang  
She blew my brain lookin at me evil eyes gleamin  
She's a I see love demon that be drinkin my semen  
And it's a to fight say we inceprable  
She nothin nice and I refuse to let it go  
She quick to loc up the daily green bud smoker  
Deep throater never toker taste like mocha  
A little vicious mairtricious five foot six  
But I'ma ruggish hoodlum so we a good mix  
I don't need no plantless little angel in my world  
You got to be a little scandless to be daddy's girl  
With that cinnamon skin that only guys create  
My mom ethatuated by a lie  
They say I'm down with massagining  
But I can't deny I love my mahogony

Now X-Raided's back up in this bitch leavin' niggas in your way

Why you done woke up the dragon?  
Thought the loc was through so niggas startin' braggin'  
About who can fuck with X now really  
Who put Sac on the map was it you don't be silly  
Will he make the beats up? Nigga what?  
And 24th Street rip  
But even blood niggas got dubs on my shit  
And thug niggas on the south side  
Slam X-Raided loc when they out ridin'  
I'm the king of this Sac-Town scene and you peasant  
I ran shit in the past well in the future and the present  
Yo Meek attempt to diss me you's a boy  
I knew you back when you was broke wearin' Bugle Boys  
Now you got tattoos ooh! You big killa  
I won't hesitate to slap you, you still a bitch nigga  
Which nigga want to war with the hardcore  
Load up you .44 playa what cha waitin' for  
Lay a motha fucka face down  
With bullet holes in your clothes  
Decapitated and naked from the waist down  
  
Chorus:  
Who is y'all new booty ass niggas tryin' diss this nigga  
I dismiss niggas  
Endless blue sportin trigga tottin menace  
Niggas that'll disfigure niggas on my shit list (2X)  
  
Nig-niggas on my shit list  
Niggas on my shit list  
Nig-niggas on my shit list  
Niggas on my shit list  
  
I know y'all busta remember me  
Pumpin' slugs in your dome lobotomizin' your memory  
It's him or me when the wars on  
My new tapes out now the south areas' a war zone  
I send letters from the pen to my true locs  
It's time to ride my nigga go out and shoot folks  
Incarceration ain't workin'  
My body's locked but my souls on the streets lurkin'  
Perkin' niggas like Folgers, motivatin' soldiers  
To make you set look like yo set got wrecked with bulldozers  
How many marks can I take in one day?  
I'ma need a little help don't trip it's on the way, hey!  
Display your corpse in the window like a mannequin  
Why damagin'  
You got no wind and it's plain and simple  
Name 'em cripple  
Get savage when I aim my pistol  
Flame a missile through your temple till your brain gristles  
Dead issues  
  
Chorus  
  
Who is y'all, who is y'all  
Yeah  
I'm through with y'all, through with y'all

Who is y'all, who is y'all  
Yeah  
I'm through with y'all, through with y'all (2X)  
  
Nigga you can't fuck with X-Raided and you hated  
I heard that little bitch ass shit that you stated, nigga  
You can't fuck with X-Raided and you hated  
I'm the motha fuckin' bomb bout to detonate it  
I consume fake rappin' mark niggas like Brut  
Chew 'em up spit 'em out piss on 'em when I'm through  
You used to be a rip now you claim damu  
You dog niggas didn't know but nigga I do  
I knew you's a hook like a you-turn  
Put your ass in a urn cremated nigga burned  
Howard Stern couldn't clown a nigga worse than Raided  
Let loose a few verses had you cursed and faded  
Like Madusa on the loop I'm turnin' true to the stone  
Spittin' brimstone burnin' motha fuckas to bone  
If it's on I'ma show you how to end this shit  
Chrome .50 caliber "Des Eags" with extended clips bitch  
  
Chorus

First Verse:  
I gather myself and try to write nicely, but I ain't feelin' that way  
I'd rather write raps that incite fights, riots, and melees  
And they say, "All X-Raided rhyme about is peelin' caps  
Prison crap, fuckin' bitches, gettin' high, and killin' cats"  
But I'm insistin' that I'm spittin' facts  
And y'all niggas is spittin' lies to feel alive  
While I'm livin' in prison  
Couldn't feel that I'm committin' convictions  
What the Hell am I supposed to write?  
How could I compose nice?  
When I'm sittin' in this cell at night like  
And steadily socializin' with  
Every soldier, sodomist, murderer, rapist  
Burgler, racist,  
And drug dealers and thug niggas caught up with three strike cases  
Man I'm faced with bein' in a cage with niggas that love hatred  
That embraced it, and can taste it  
And ain't, feelin' no disgrace  
Would be willin' to pull your heart out and replace it with a cold one  
More should, show love, for the young ones to the old ones  
And where they come from is irrelavent  
But they're gettin' here so face it  
Gotta come up in, if you think you wouldn't be up in, chill  
Revelation, I ain't got no patience for this fakin'  
Hate me and then you can reflect reports straight crip  
Blue and gray bitch  
y'all niggas sport pink and turquoise  
I'm laced with gunpowder from up out of a .44 caliber ???  
Say sin, see my face sin  
Sick to see cuts and disgrace men  
To replace men, but they gotta...  
Chorus:  
Agree with me  
I just write what I see  
Might not believe in me  
I just write what I see  
I might not like what I see  
But whether it's wrong or right  
It ain't a song, it's my life  
I just write what I see  
(2x)
