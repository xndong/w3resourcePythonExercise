That slow burn wait while it gets dark,  
Bruising the sun, I feel grown up with you in your car  
I know it's dumb  
  
We've both got a million bad habits to kick  
Not sleeping is one  
We're biting our nails, you're biting my lip  
I'm biting my tongue  
  
When people are talking, people are talking  
When People are talking, people are talking  
  
Raise a glass, 'cause I'm not done saying it  
They all wanna get rough, get away with it  
Let 'em talk 'cause we're dancing in this world alone  
We're all alone  
We're alone  
  
All my fake friends and all of their noise  
Complain about work  
They're studying business, I study the floor  
And you haven't stopped smoking all night  
Maybe the Internet raised us  
Or maybe people are jerks  
  
When people are talking, people are talking (But not you)  
When people are talking, people are talking  
  
Raise a glass, 'cause I'm not done saying it  
They all wanna get rough, get away with it  
Let 'em talk 'cause we're dancing in this world alone  
We're all alone  
We're alone  
  
All the double-edged people and schemes  
They make a mess then go home and get clean  
You're my best friend, and we're dancing in a world alone,  
We're all alone  
We're all alone  
  
I know we're not everlasting  
We're a train wreck waiting to happen  
One day the blood won't flow so gladly  
One day we're all get still  
When people are talking, people are talking  
Get still  
  
When people are talking, people are talking  
When people are talking, people are talking  
  
Raise a glass, 'cause I'm not done saying it  
They all wanna get rough, get away with it  
Let 'em talk 'cause we're dancing in this world alone  
We're all alone  
We're alone  
  
All the double-edged people and schemes  
They make a mess then go home and get clean  
You're my best friend, so we're dancing in a world alone  
We're all alone  
We're all alone  
  
When people are talking, people are talking  
When people are talking, people are talking  
When people are talking, people are talking  
When people are talking, people are talking  
  
Let 'em talk

It feels better biting down  
It feels better biting down  
It feels better biting down  
It feels better biting down  
It feels better biting down  
It feels better biting down  
  
Skip a hit, don't make a sound  
It feels better biting down  
  
Breathed so deep I thought I'd drown  
It feels better biting down  
  
Listen to the beats resound  
It feels better biting down  
It feels better biting down  
  
It feels better biting down  
It feels better biting down  
It feels better biting down  
  
Skip a hit, don't make a sound  
It feels better biting down  
  
Breathed so deep I thought I'd drown  
It feels better biting down  
  
Listen to the beats resound  
It feels better biting down  
It feels better biting down  
  
The electronics of your heart  
See how fast they fall apart  
It feels better biting down  
  
The electronics of your heart  
See how fast they fall apart

I remember when your head caught flame  
It kissed your scalp and caressed your brain  
Well you laughed, baby it's okay  
It's buzz cut season anyway  
(Well you laughed, baby it's okay)  
  
Explosions on TV, and all the girls with heads inside a dream  
So now we live beside the pool, where everything is good  
  
We ride the bus with the knees pulled in  
People should see how we're living  
(We ride the bus with the knees pulled in)  
Shut my eyes to the song that plays  
Sometimes this has a hot, sweet taste  
(Shut my eyes to the song that plays)  
  
The men up on the news, they try to tell us all that we will lose  
But it's so easy in this blue, where everything is good  
  
And I'll never go home again (place the call, feel it start)  
Favorite friend (and nothing's wrong when nothing's true)  
I live in a hologram with you  
We're all the things that we do for fun (and I'll breathe, and it goes)  
Play along (make-believe it's hyper real)  
But I live in a hologram with you  
  
Cola with the burnt-out taste  
I'm the one you tell your fears to  
There'll never be enough of us  
  
Explosions on TV, and all the girls with heads inside a dream  
So now we live beside the pool, where everything is good  
  
And I'll never go home again (place the call, feel it start)  
Favorite friend (and nothing's wrong when nothing's true)  
I live in a hologram with you  
We're all the things that we do for fun (and I'll breathe, and it goes)  
Play along (make-believe it's hyper real)  
But I live in a hologram with you

Easy, easy  
Pull out your heart  
To make the being alone  
Easy, easy  
Pull out your heart  
To make the being alone  
Easy, easy  
  
Easy, easy  
You break the bridle to make  
Losing control  
Easy, easy  
Crushed what you're holding  
So you can say letting go is  
Easy, easy  
  
Oh, easy, easy  
Burn all your things  
To make the fight to forget  
Easy, oh, easy  
Burn all your things  
To make the fight to forget  
Easy  
  
Easy, easy  
Pull out your heart  
To make the being alone  
Easy, easy  
Pull out your heart  
To make the being alone  
Easy

Welcome to your life  
There's no turning back  
Even while we sleep  
We will find you  
  
Acting on your best behaviour  
Turn your back on mother nature  
Everybody wants to rule the world  
  
It's my own design  
It's my own remorse  
Help me to decide  
Help me make the most  
  
Of freedom and of pleasure  
Nothing ever lasts forever  
Everybody wants to rule the world  
  
There's a room where the light won't find you  
Holding hands while the walls come tumbling down  
When they do I'll be right behind you  
  
So glad we've almost made it  
So sad they had to fade it  
Everybody wants to rule the world  
Everybody wants to rule the world  
Everybody wants to rule the world

There's a humming in the restless summer air  
And we're slipping off the course that we prepared  
But in all chaos, there is calculation  
Dropping glasses just to hear them break  
You've been drinking like the world was gonna end (it didn't)  
Took a shiner from the fist of your best friend (go figure)  
It's clear that someone's gotta go  
We mean it, but I promise we're not mean  
  
And the cry goes out (ha)  
They lose their minds for us, and how it plays out (ha)  
Now we're in the ring and we're coming for blood  
  
(Oh! Oh!)  
You could try and take us (oh-oh)  
But we're the gladiators (Oh! Oh!)  
Everyone a rager (oh-oh)  
But secretly they're saviors  
Glory and gore go hand in hand  
That's why we're making headlines (Oh! Oh!)  
You could try and take us (oh-oh)  
But victory's contagious  
  
Delicate in every way but one (the swordplay)  
God knows we like archaic kinds of fun (the old way)  
Chance is the only game I play with, baby  
We let our battles choose us  
  
And the cry goes out (ha oh)  
They lose their minds for us and how it plays out (ha oh)  
Now we're in the ring and we're coming for blood  
  
(Oh! Oh!)  
You could try and take us (oh-oh)  
But we're the gladiators (Oh! Oh!)  
Everyone a rager (oh-oh)  
But secretly they're saviors  
Glory and gore go hand in hand  
That's why we're making headlines (Oh! Oh!)  
You could try and take us (oh-oh)  
But victory's contagious  
  
No-one 'round here's good at keeping their eyes closed  
The sun's starting to light up when we're walking home  
Tired little laughs, gold lie promises,  
We'll always win at this, I don't ever think about death  
It's alright if you do, it's fine  
We gladiate but I guess we're really fighting ourselves  
Roughing up our minds so we're ready when the kill time comes  
Wide awake in bed, words in my brain,  
"Secretly you love this, do you even wanna go free?"  
Let me in the ring, I'll show you what that big word means  
  
(Oh! Oh!)  
You could try and take us (oh-oh)  
But we're the gladiators (Oh! Oh!)  
Everyone a rager (oh-oh)  
But secretly they're saviors  
Glory and gore go hand in hand  
That's why we're making headlines (Oh! Oh!)  
You could try and take us (oh-oh)  
But victory's contagious

It's time to let the lost boys take you in  
It's getting cold out  
You wear yourself down  
So please don't go out  
You're looking dead behind these eyes  
We'll stay at your house  
Watch all those late shows on TV  
I like it best when you're in here with me  
And all the lost boys  
We'd make a picture perfect team  
Bruising sidewalks  
With all the drumming of our feet  
And boy I promise  
We'll never ever let you leave  
Never let you leave

There's nothing I want but money and time  
Million dollar bills and a tick tick tick tick  
There's nothing more cruel  
Than only nine lives  
A limit in spite  
Will do the trick trick trick trick  
  
We can leave the house lead the party let the people know  
Go drown the colors of our minds and watch the cards go  
  
There's nothing as fun as coming untied  
And running with the kids in the park park park park  
There's nothing that hurts like letting you go  
Tiger burn eyes in the dark dark dark dark  
  
We can leave the house lead the party let the people know  
Go drown the colors of our minds and watch the cards go  
It's not about just being out with all our people  
'Cause we can get in trouble just by going free throw  
And now I'm letting you know and now I'm letting you know  
And now I'm letting you know and now I'm letting you know

The drink you spilt all over me  
'Lover's Spit' left on repeat  
My mom and dad let me stay home  
It drives you crazy, getting old  
  
We can talk it so good  
We can make it so divine  
We can talk it good  
How you wish it would be all the time  
  
The drink you spilt all over me  
'Lover's Spit' left on repeat  
My mom and dad let me stay home  
It drives you crazy, getting old  
  
The drink you spilt all over me  
'Lover's Spit' left on repeat  
My mom and dad let me stay home  
It drives you crazy, getting old  
  
This dream isn't feeling sweet  
We're reeling through the midnight streets  
And I've never felt more alone  
It feels so scary, getting old  
  
We can talk it so good  
We can make it so divine  
We can talk it good  
How you wish it would be all the time  
  
This dream isn't feeling sweet  
We're reeling through the midnight streets  
And I've never felt more alone  
It feels so scary, getting old  
  
This dream isn't feeling sweet

And I've never felt more alone  
It feels so scary, getting old  
  
I want 'em back (I want 'em back)  
The minds we had (the minds we had)  
How all the thoughts (how all the thoughts)  
Moved 'round our heads (moved 'round our heads)  
I want 'em back (I want 'em back)  
The minds we had (the minds we had)  
It's not enough to feel the lack  
I want 'em back, I want 'em back, I want 'em  
  
You're the only friend I need  
Sharing beds like little kids  
Laughing 'til our ribs get tough  
But that will never be enough  
  
You're the only friend I need

I've never seen a diamond in the flesh  
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies  
And I'm not proud of my address, in the torn up town  
No post code envy  
  
But every song's like gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom  
Blood stains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room  
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams  
But everybody's like Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece.  
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash  
We don't care, we ain't caught up in your love affair  
  
And we'll never be royals (royals)  
It don't run in our blood  
That kind of luxe just ain't for us  
We crave a different kind of buzz  
Let me be your ruler (ruler), you can call me Queen Bee  
And baby I'll rule (I'll rule I'll rule I'll rule)  
Let me live that fantasy  
  
My friends and I we've cracked the code  
We count our dollars on the train to the party  
And everyone who knows us knows that we're fine with this  
We didn't come from money  
  
But every song's like gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom  
Blood stains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room  
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams  
But everybody's like Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece.  
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash  
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair  
  
And we'll never be royals (royals)  
It don't run in our blood  
That kind of luxe just ain't for us  
We crave a different kind of buzz  
Let me be your ruler (ruler), you can call me Queen Bee  
And baby I'll rule (I'll rule I'll rule I'll rule)  
Let me live that fantasy  
  
(Ooh ooh oh)  
We're bigger than we ever dreamed, and I'm in love with being queen  
(Ooh ooh oh)  
Love is great without a care  
We aren't caught up in your love affair  
  
And we'll never be royals (royals)  
It don't run in our blood  
That kind of luxe just ain't for us  
We crave a different kind of buzz  
Let me be your ruler (ruler), you can call me Queen Bee  
And baby I'll rule (I'll rule I'll rule I'll rule)  
Let me live that fantasy

Wait 'til you're announced  
We've not yet lost all our graces  
The hounds will stay in chains  
Look upon your greatness that you'll send the call out  
Send the call out  
  
Call all the ladies out, they're in their finery  
A hundred jewels on throats  
A hundred jewels between teeth  
Now bring my boys in, their skin in craters like the moon  
The moon we love like a brother, while he glows through the room  
Dancin' around the lies we tell  
Dancin' around big eyes as well  
Even the comatose, they don't dance and tell  
  
We live in cities you'll never see onscreen  
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things  
Livin' in ruins of a palace within my dreams  
And you know we're on each other's team  
  
I'm kind of over gettin' told to throw my hands up in the air  
So there  
  
So all the cups got broke  
Shards beneath our feet  
But it wasn't my fault  
And everyone's competing for a love they won't receive  
Cause what this palace wants is release  
  
We live in cities you'll never see onscreen  
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things  
Livin' in ruins of a palace within my dreams  
And you know we're on each other's team  
  
I'm kind of over gettin' told to throw my hands up in the air  
So there  
I'm kind of older than I was when I reveled without a care  
So there  
  
We live in cities you'll never see onscreen  
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things  
Livin' in ruins of a palace within my dreams  
And you know we're on each other's team  
  
We're on each other's team  
And you know we're on each other's team  
We're on each other's team  
And you know and you know and you know

I'm in a clique but I want out  
It's not the same as when I was punched  
In the old days there was enough  
The card games and ease with the bitter salt of blood  
I was in but I want out  
My mother's love is choking me  
I'm sick of words that hang above my head  
What about the kid? It's time the kid got free  
  
Be a part of the love club  
Everything will glow for you  
You'll get punched for the love club  
For the love club  
  
I joined the club and it's all on  
There are fights for being my best friend  
And the girls get their claws out  
There's something about hanging out with the wicked kids  
Take the pill make it too ill  
The other day I forgot my old address  
I'm sitting pretty on the throne  
There's nothing more I want  
Except to be alone  
  
Be a part of the love club  
Everything will glow for you  
You'll get punched for the love club  
For the love club  
  
Your clothes are soaked and you don't know where to go  
So drop your chin and take yourself back home  
And roll out your maps and papers  
Find out your hiding places again  
The only problem that I got with the club  
Is how you're severed from the people who watched you grow up  
When you're a member go on your great adventure again  
They will be waiting at the end  
  
Be a part of the love club  
Everything will glow for you  
You'll get punched for the love club  
For the love club

We wouldn't be seen dead here in the day yeah  
I guess you're lucky that it's dark now  
And if I like it then we'll stay  
Impress the empress, take a shot now  
  
We got the glow in our mouths  
White teeth teens are out  
White teeth teens are  
  
Up for it  
I know you love it when the hairpins started to drop  
I like your reckoning  
But we got our methods and there's nothing here to stop  
To stop this  
  
If you want we'll help tonight to split his schemes  
Give the bruises out like gifts  
You'll get the picture of your dreams  
I won't be smiling but the notes from my admirers  
Fill my dashboard just the same  
  
We got the glow in our mouths  
White teeth teens are out  
White teeth teens are  
  
Up for it  
I know you love it when the hairpins start to drop  
I like your reckoning,  
But we got our methods and there's nothing here to stop  
To stop this when we're  
  
Up for it  
I know you love it when the hairpins start to drop  
I like your reckoning,  
But we got our methods and there's nothing here to stop  
To stop this  
  
(And everything works out so good)  
(I wear the robe like no one could)  
  
I'll let you in on something big  
I am not a white teeth teen  
I tried to join but never did  
The way they are, the way they seem is something else, it's in the blood  
Their molars blinking like the lights, in the underpass where we all sit  
And do nothing and love it  
  
And everything works out so good  
I wear the robe like no one could  
  
And everything works out so good  
I wear the robe like no one could  
  
And everything works out so good  
I wear the robe like no one could  
  
(White teeth teens are out)  
And everything works out so good  
(I wear the robe like no one could)  
White teeth teens are out

[Verse 1]  
I'm a princess cut from marble, smoother than a storm  
And the scars that mark my body, they're silver and gold  
My blood is a flood of rubies, precious stones  
It keeps my veins hot, the fires find a home in me  
I move through town, I'm quiet like a fire  
And my necklace is of rope, i tie it and untie it  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
And now people talk to me, but nothing ever hits home  
So people talk to me, and all the voices just burn holes  
I'm done with it (ooh)  
  
[Chorus]  
This is the start of how it all ends  
They used to shout my name, now they whisper it  
I'm speeding up and this is the  
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart  
We're at the start, the colors disappear  
I never watch the stars there's so much down here  
So I just try to keep up with them  
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart  
  
[Verse 2]  
I dream all year, but they're not the same kinds  
And the shivers move down my shoulder blades in double time  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
And now people talk to me I'm slipping out of reach now  
People talk to me, and all their faces blur  
But I got my fingers laced together and I made a little prison  
And I'm locking up everyone who ever laid a finger on me  
I'm done with it (ooh)  
  
[Chorus]  
This is the start of how it all ends  
They used to shout my name, now they whisper it  
I'm speeding up and this is the  
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart  
We're at the start, the colors disappear  
I never watch the stars there's so much down here  
So I just try to keep up with them  
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart  
  
[Outro]  
And this is the red, orange, yellow flicker beat  
Sparking up my heart  
And this is the red, orange, yellow flicker beat-beat-beat-beat
