I don't gamble, I don't fight  
I don't be hangin' in the bars at night  
Yeah I used to be a fighter but  
Now I am a wiser man  
  
I don't drink much, I don't smoke  
I don't be hardly mess around with no dope  
Yeah I used to be a problem but  
Now I am a careful man  
  
[Chorus]  
But if you used to want to see a commotion  
You shoulda seen the man that I used to be  
I was trouble in perpetual motion  
Trouble with a capital "T"  
Stayin' out late, havin' fun  
And shot off every single shot in my gun  
Yeah I used to be a lover but  
Now I'm an older man  
  
[Chorus]  
  
But if you used to want to see a commotion  
You shoulda seen the man that I used to be  
I was trouble in perpetual motion  
Trouble with a capital "T"  
Stayin' out late, havin' fun  
And shot off every single shot in my gun  
Yeah I used to be a terror but  
Now I am a tired man  
Yeah I used to be a terror but  
Now I am a tired man

A child arrived just the other day,  
Came to the world in the usual way,  
But there were planes to catch  
And bills to pay, he learned to walk while I was away  
He was talking before I knew it and as he grew  
He said I'm going to be like you Dad,  
You know I'm going to be like you.  
  
And the cat's in the cradle, and the silver spoon,  
Little Boy Blue, and the Man in the Moon,  
When you coming home son, I don't know when  
We'll get together then, you know we'll have a good time then.  
  
My son turned 10 just the other day,  
Said thanks for the ball now c'mon let's play  
Will you teach me to throw, I said not today,  
I've got a lot to do, he said that's ok  
And he walked away and he smiled and he said  
You know I'm going to be like you, Dad,  
You know I'm going to be like you.  
  
And the cat's in the cradle, and the silver spoon,  
Little Boy Blue, and the Man in the Moon,  
When you coming home son, I don't know when  
We'll get together then, you know we'll have a good time then.  
  
He came from college just the other day,  
So much like a man I just had to say,  
I'm proud of you, won't you sit for a while  
He shook his head and said with a smile,  
What I'm feeling like, Dad, is to borrow the car keys  
See you later can I have them please.  
  
And the cat's in the cradle, and the silver spoon,  
Little Boy Blue, and the Man in the Moon,  
When you coming home son, I don't know when  
We'll get together then, you know we'll have a good time then.  
  
I've long since retired and my son's moved away  
I called him up just the other day  
I'd like to see you, if you don't mind  
He said I'd love to Dad, if I could find the time  
You see my new job's a hassle and the kids have the flu  
But it's sure nice talking you Dad, it's been real nice talking to you.  
And as I hung up the phone it occured to me  
He'd grown up just like me, my boy was just like me.  
  
And the cat's in the cradle, and the silver spoon,  
Little Boy Blue, and the Man in the Moon,  
When you coming home son, I don't know when  
We'll get together then, you know we'll have a good time then.  
  
And the cat's in the cradle, and the silver spoon,  
Little Boy Blue, and the Man in the Moon,  
When you coming home son, I don't know when  
We'll get together then, you know we'll have a good time then.

I know a fool who blows a horn  
He comes from way down South, oh yeah  
And you ain't seen some blowin' since you been born  
Like when a trombone's to his mouth  
He wails and moans, grunts and groans  
He can moan just like a cow  
And you ain't seen some blowin' since you been born  
Cause he won't show them how  
Chorus:  
Oh Charlie won't you play that thing  
I mean the slide trombone  
Make it talk  
Make it sing  
I mean the slide trombone  
If Gabriel knew how you could blow  
He'd let you lead his band I know  
Oh Charlie won't you play that thing  
I mean the slide trombone  
Chorus  
Now you ain't seen such movin' hips  
Like when the trombone's to his lips  
Charlie Green play that thing  
I mean the slide trombone  
Oh yeah, I mean the slide trombone  
  

She stood by the window and let down her hair  
Asked if I knew that I shouldn't be there  
Her lips said goodbye  
But her body said stay  
I knew I should go but I stayed anyway  
  
And they called her child of midnight  
And they say she'd love  
Whomever she find  
But when morning came I loved her  
And she stayed there in my mind  
  
She stood by the window and let down her hair  
Asked if I thought that it was right  
That she give her body and I give my mind  
I looked for an answer all the night  
  
And they called her child of midnight  
And they say she'd love  
Whomever she find  
But when morning came I loved her  
And she stayed there in my mind  
  
She stood by the window and tied up her hair  
Acted as if I had never been there  
Her lips said goodbye  
But her body said stay  
I knew I should go but I stayed anyway  
  
And they called her child of midnight  
And they say she'd love  
Whomever she find  
But when morning came I loved her  
And she stayed there in my mind

She was just a country girl  
Didn't have those New York City ways  
When she hopped a bus in Ohio  
Headin' for the crowded streets where no one says a word  
  
She was just a country girl living in the lonely city  
Met a man who learned her name  
She became a woman on a rainy New York night  
  
There's a new day dawnin' in the city  
She calls her Mama collect  
Sayin' Mama send bus fare back to Ohio  
Have somebody meet me at the depot  
  
She was just a country girl  
Spent some time in New York City  
Now she tells her friends about lonely New York City  
And her lonely New York night  
  
There's a new day dawnin' in the city  
She calls her Mama collect  
Sayin' Mama send bus fare back to Ohio  
Have somebody meet me at the depot  
  
She was just a country girl  
She was just a country girl

Don't you know I had a dream last night  
That you were here with me  
Lyin' by my side so soft and warm  
And we talked a while  
And shared a smile  
And then we shared the dawn  
But when I woke up  
Oh, my dream it was gone  
Don't you know I had a dream last night  
You were here with me  
Lyin' by my side so soft and warm  
And you said you'd thought it over  
Said that you were comin' home  
But then I woke up  
From my dream it was gone  
I'm not the same  
Can you blame me  
Is it hard to understand  
I can't forget  
You can't change me  
I am not that kind of man  
Don't you know I had a dream last night  
When everything was still  
And you were by my side so soft and warm  
And I dreamed that we were lovers  
In the lemon-scented rain  
But the I woke up  
Oh, I found that again  
I had been dreamin'  
Dreamin' again  
I had been dreamin'  
Dreamin' again

Well, she was standing by my dressing room after the show  
Asking for my autograph and asked if she could go  
Back to my motel room. But the rest is just a tragic tale  
Because five short minutes of lovin'  
Done brought me twenty long years in jail  
  
Well, like a fool in a hurry I took her to my room  
She casted me in plaster while I sang her a tune  
Then I said, "Ooh, ooee!" Sure was a tragic tale  
Because five short minutes of lovin'  
Done brought me twenty long years in jail  
  
Well, then a judge and a jury sat me in a room  
They say that robbin' the cradle is worse than robbin' the tomb  
Then I said "Ooh, ooee!" Sure was a tragic tale  
(Wasn't worth it, wasn't worth it!)  
Because five short minutes of lovin'  
Done brought me twenty long years in jail  
  
And when I get out of this prison gonna be forty-five  
I'll know I used to like to do it but I won't remember why  
(Wasn't worth it, wasn't worth it!)  
I'll say "Ooh, ooee! Sure was a tragic tale  
Because five short minutes of lovin'  
Done brought me twenty long years in jail  
  
Because five short minutes of lovin'  
Done brought me twenty long years in jail

Some people say I'm a no 'count  
Others say I'm no good  
But I'm just a nat'ral born travellin' man  
Doin' what I think should, oh yeah  
Doin' what I think should  
Chorus:  
When I was a little baby my mama said, hey son  
Travel where you will and grow to be a man  
But sing what must be sung, poor boy Sing what must be sung  
And I don't give a damn about a greenback dollar  
I spend it fast as I can  
For a wailing song and a good guitar  
The only things that I understand, poor boy  
The only things that I understand  
Chorus  
Now that I'm a grown man  
I've travelled here and there  
I found that a jug of brandy and a song  
Are the only ones who care, poor boy  
The only ones who care  
Chorus  
  

You may talk of gin and beer  
When you're stationed way out here  
An' you're sent to penny fights an' Aldershot it  
But when it comes to slaughter  
You will do your work for water  
An' you'll lick the boots of 'I'm that's got it  
Now in Inja's sunny clime  
Where I used to spend my time  
Servin' her Majesty the Queen  
Of all the black faced crew  
The finest man I knew  
Was regimental bhisti, Gunga Din  
  
The uniform he wore  
Was nothin' much before  
An' rather less than half of that behind  
But a piece of twisty rag  
An' a goatskin water bag  
Was all the field equipment he could find  
  
When a sweatin' troop train lay  
In a sidin' through the day  
Where the heat would make you bloomin' eyebrows crawl  
We shouted, "Harry By"  
Till our throats were bricky-dry  
Then wopped him 'cause he couldn't serve us all  
He would dot an' carry one  
Till the longest day was done  
An' never seemed to know the use of fear  
If we charged or broke or cut  
You could bet your bloomin' nut  
He'd be waitin' fifty paces right flank rear  
With his mussick on his back  
He would skip to our attack  
An' watch us till the bugles made"Retire"  
An' for all his dirty hide  
He was white, clear white inside  
When he went to tend the wounded under fire  
  
It was Din, Din, Din  
With the bullets kickin' dust spots on the green  
And when the cartridges ran out  
You could hear the front files shout  
Send ammunition mules, and Gunga Din!  
I shan't forget the night  
When I fell behind the fight  
With a bullet where my belt plate should a' been  
I was chokin' mad with thirst  
An' the man that spied me first  
Was our good old grinnin', gruntin' Gunga Din  
He lifted up my head  
An' he plugged me where I bled  
An' he gave me half a pint of water green  
It was crawlin' and it stunk  
But of all the drinks I've drunk  
I'm most grateful to the one from Gunga Din  
  
He carried me away  
To where a dooli lay  
An' a bullet came and drilled the beggar clean  
He carried me inside  
An' just before he died  
I hope you like your drink said Gunga Din  
So I'll meet him later on  
In the place where he as gone  
Where it's always double drill and no canteen  
He'll be squattin' on the coals  
Givin' drink to poor damn souls  
I'll catch a swig in hell from Gunga Din  
  
It was Din, Din, Din  
You Lazarushian-leather Gunga Din  
Tho' I've belted you an' flayed you  
By the livin' God that made you  
Your a better man than I am, Gunga Din

[Chorus]  
And you think you've seen trouble  
Well you're lookin' at the man  
Oh the world's own original hard luck story  
And a hard time losin' man  
  
Oh sometimes skies are cloudy  
And sometimes skies are blue  
And sometimes they say that you eat the bear  
But sometimes the bear eats you  
And sometimes I feel like I should go  
Far far away and hide  
'Cause I keep a waitin' for my ship to come in  
And all that ever comes is the tide  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh I saved up all my money  
I gonna buy me a flashy car  
So I go downtown to see the man  
And he smokin' on a big cigar  
Well he must' a thought I were Rockefeller  
Or an uptown man of wealth  
He said "Boy I got the car that's made for you  
And it's cleaner than the Board of Health"  
Then I got on the highway oh I feelin' fine, I hit a bump  
Then I found I bought a car held together  
By wire, and a couple a' hunks of twine  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh Friday night, feelin' right  
I head out on the street  
Standin' in the doorway  
Was a dealer known as Pete  
Well he sold me a dime of some super-fine  
Dynamite from Mexico  
I spent all night  
Just tryin' to get right  
On an ounce of Oregano  
  
[Chorus]

Hey tomorrow, where are you goin'  
Do you have some room for me  
'Cause night is fallin' and the dawn is callin'  
I'll have a new day if she'll have me  
  
Hey tomorrow, I can't show you nothin'  
You've seen it all pass by your door  
So many times I said I been changin'  
Then slipped into patterns of what happened before  
  
'Cause I've been wasted and I've over-tasted  
All the things that life gave to me  
And I've been trusted, abused and busted  
And I've been taken by those close to me  
  
Hey tomorrow you've gotta believe that  
I'm through wastin' what's left of me  
'Cause night is fallin' and the dawn is callin'  
I'll have a new day if she'll have me  
  
Hey tomorrow, where are you goin'  
Do you have some room for me  
'Cause night is fallin' and the dawn is callin'  
I'll have a new day if she'll have me  
I'll have a new day if she'll have me

Perhaps I'll never show this world all I could be  
  
I just can't sing to any man the song he wants to hear  
And I know that some won't like me  
  
Others try to be my friend  
But I'm all of me, and that's all that I am  
  
Chorus:  
And if life is for the living  
  
Then why can't men be real  
  
'Stead of hidin' in their costumes  
  
Forgettin' how to feel, forgettin' how to feel  
  
We still live in a time when manners cover what is real  
  
There's a basic fact of life that the times cannot conceal  
That if some are masqueraders  
  
Others live in their facade  
But I'm what I am  
  
I cannot be what I am not  
  
Chorus  
  
I may be too honest and offend those who pretend  
  
I don't claim I'm always right, that I'm ev'rybody's friend  
Perhaps for them it's easier to be what they are not  
  
But I'm what I am, and I just can't play that part  
  
Chorus

Well, I know it's kind of late  
I hope I didn't wake you  
But what I got to say can't wait  
I know you'd understand  
Every time I tried to tell you  
The words just came out wrong  
So I'll have to say I love you in a song  
  
Yeah, I know it's kind of strange  
But every time I'm near you  
I just run out of things to say  
I know you'd understand  
Every time I tried to tell you  
The words just came out wrong  
So I'll have to say I love you in a song  
  
Every time the time was right  
All the words just came out wrong  
So I'll have to say I love you in a song  
  
Yeah, I know it's kind of late  
I hope I didn't wake you  
But there's something that I just got to say  
I know you'd understand  
Every time I tried to tell you  
The words just came out wrong  
So I"ll have to say I love you in a song

Like the pine trees lining the winding road  
I've got a name  
I've got a name  
Like the singing bird and the croaking toad  
I've got a name  
I've got a name  
And I carry it with me like my daddy did  
But I'm living the dream that he kept hid  
Moving me down the highway  
Rolling me down the highway  
Moving ahead so life won't pass me by  
Like the North wind whistling down the sky  
I've got a song  
I've got a song  
Like the whip-poor-will and the baby's cry  
I've got a song  
I've got a song  
And I carry it with me and I sing it loud  
If it gets me nowhere, I'll go there proud  
Moving me down the highway  
Rolling me down the highway  
Moving ahead so life won't pass me by  
And I'm gonna go there free  
Like the fool I am and I'll always be  
I've got a dream  
I've got a dream  
They can change their minds but they can't change me  
I've got a dream  
I've got a dream  
I know I could share it if you want me to  
If your going my way I'll go with you  
Moving me down the highway  
Rolling me down the highway  
Moving ahead so life won't pass me by  
Moving me down the highway  
Rolling me down the highway  
Moving ahead so life won't pass me by

If it were just another day  
You know I might have stayed  
But I couldn't hang around  
To be beaten to the ground  
  
[Chorus]  
You asked me for something  
You know I couldn't lend  
You tried to make me break  
But it hurt too much to bend  
And the more I see of what used to be our love, I find  
That we've just been going nowhere  
And we're never gonna get there  
And we're wastin' our time  
  
If I were just another guy  
You know I might have tried  
To fit into you schemes  
And to have a plastic dream  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It was just another lie  
I couldn't swallow when I tried  
Just enough to realize  
I'd been pretendin' all the time  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You asked me for something  
You know I couldn't lend  
You tried to make me break  
But it hurt too much to bend  
And the more I see of what used to be our love, I find  
That we've just been going nowhere  
And we're never gonna get there  
And we're wastin' our time  
  
And the more I see of what used to be our love, I find  
That we've just been going nowhere  
And we're never gonna get there  
And we're wastin' our time  
And we're wastin' our time

Guess that it was bound to happen  
Was just a matter of time  
But now I've come to my decision  
And it's a-one of the painful kind  
'Cause now it seems that you wanted a martyr  
Just a regular guy wouldn't do  
But baby I can't hang upon no lover's cross for you  
  
Yes, I really got to hand it to you  
'Cause girl you really tried  
But for ev'ry time that we spent laughin'  
There were two times that I cried  
And you were tryin' to make me your martyr  
And that's the one thing I just couldn't do  
'Cause baby, I can't hang upon no lover's cross for you  
  
'Cause tables are meant for turnin'  
And people are bound to change  
And bridges are meant for burnin'  
When the people and mem'ries they join aren't the same  
  
So I'll hope that you can find  
Another who can take what I could not  
He'll have to be a super guy  
Or maybe a super god  
'Cause I never was much of a martyr before  
And I ain't 'bout to start nothin' new  
And baby, I can't hang upon no lover's cross for you  
  
'Cause tables are meant for turnin'  
And people are bound to change  
And bridges are meant for burnin'  
When the people and mem'ries they join aren't the same  
  
So I'll hope that you can find  
Another who can take what I could not  
He'll have to be a super guy  
Or maybe a super god  
'Cause I never was much of a martyr before  
And I ain't 'bout to start nothin' new  
And baby, I can't hang upon no lover's cross for you

Smoke another cigarette, have another drink or two  
Sit by the telephone 'til morning  
She never tells me where she's goin'  
But I think it's mighty plain  
Maybe tomorrow  
She'll be back home again  
  
She wasn't like this when I met her  
Whatever made her change?  
Now she never even says I love you  
She just comes a-rollin' in  
Never wanting to explain  
Maybe tomorrow she'll be back home again  
  
Wish that I could meet him  
Just to tell him who I am  
I would like to find out what he has  
That I don't have  
  
She never says a thing about him but it's plain as day  
She's going somewhere every evening  
Can't take it too much longer  
I think I'm goin' insane  
Maybe tomorrow she'll be back home again  
  
Wish that I could meet him  
Just to tell him who I am  
I would like to find out what he has  
That I don't have  
  
She never says a thing about him but it's plain as day  
She's going somewhere every evening  
Can't take it too much longer  
I think I'm goin' insane  
Maybe tomorrow she'll be back home again

With just a sleeping bag and an old guitar  
I left the band in New Orleans  
I did some time with the bottle, some with the river queens  
I never thought I would meet a girl  
Who could turn my head around  
Till I met that Mississippi Lady in sleepy Gulfport town, she was a  
  
[Chorus]  
Mississippi Lady  
My lovin' Gulfport gal  
She taught me how to love  
And she really loved me well  
She took me up to heaven  
Then she brought me down  
That Mississippi Lady, Sweet Cordelia Brown  
  
Hot July in Gulfport  
And I was working in the bars  
And she was working on the street  
With the rest of the evening stars  
She said, I never met a guy  
Who could turn my head around  
And that's really sayin' something  
For Sweet Cordelia Brown  
  
She was a  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now I'm back in New York City  
Playin' in a band  
But my mind's on Mississippi  
Is it hard to understand  
I never thought I would meet a girl  
Who could bring me that far down  
Like the girl I met in Gulfport  
Sweet Cordelia Brown  
  
She was a  
  
[Chorus]  
  
That Mississippi lady, Sweet Cordelia Brown

If you get to feelin' all alone  
When your good time friends have all got up and gone  
Don't come knockin' around my door  
Because I've heard your lines before  
  
[Chorus]  
And there ain't gonna be a next time this time  
'Cause woman startin' right now  
I'm gonna forget you name and your pretty face, girl  
And write you off as a bad mistake  
You know that some women, they are lovers  
And some just got no sense  
But a woman like you oughta be ashamed  
Of the things that you do to men  
  
If you get to feeling all alone  
When you find that you can't make it on your own  
Don't come knockin' around my door  
You see I've seen your act before  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If you get to feelin' you were wrong  
Don't go wastin' your good money on the phone  
'Cause I can hang up as fast as you can call  
And that ain't all  
  
And there ain't gonna be a next time this time  
'Cause woman startin' right now  
I'm gonna forget you name and your pretty face, girl  
And write you off as a complete disgrace  
You know that some women they are liars  
And some just got no sense  
But a woman like you oughta be ashamed  
Of the things that you do to men  
  
Yeah a woman like you oughta be ashamed  
Of the things that you do to men

Nobody loves a fat girl  
But oh how a fat girl can love  
Nobody seems to want me  
I'm just a truck upon the highway of love  
  
I'm all alone inside of my form  
When every ounce of me is dyin' to keep somebody warm  
Nobody loves a fat girl  
But oh how a fat girl can love  
  
Nobody loves a fat girl  
But oh how a fat girl can love  
Nobody seems to want me  
I'm just a truck upon the highway of love  
The only game I can get the boys to play  
Is to have them sit around and try to guess how much I weigh  
Nobody loves a fat girl  
But oh how a fat girl can love, pretty mama  
Oh how a fat girl can love

We been runnin' away from  
Somethin' we both know  
We've long run out of things to say  
And I think I better go  
  
So don't be getting' excited  
When you hear that slammin' door  
'Cause there'll be one less set of footsteps  
On your floor in the mornin'  
  
And we've been hidin' from somethin'  
That should have never gone this far  
But after all it's what we've done  
That makes us what we are  
  
And you been talkin' in silence  
If it's silence you adore  
Oh there'll be one less set of footsteps  
On your floor in the mornin'  
  
[Chorus]  
Well there'll be one less set of footsteps on your floor  
One less man to walk in  
One less pair of jeans upon your door  
One less voice a'talkin'  
  
But tomorrow's a dream away  
Today has turned to dust  
Your silver tongue has turned to clay  
And your golden rule to rust  
If that's the way that you want it  
That's the way I want it more  
There'll be one less set of footsteps  
On your floor in the mornin'  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There'll be one less set of footsteps  
On your floor in the mornin'

Photographs and memories  
Christmas cards you sent to me  
All that I have are these  
To remember you  
  
Memories that come at night  
Take me to another time  
Back to a happier day  
When I called you mine  
  
But we sure had a good time  
When we started way back when  
Morning walks and bedroom talks  
Oh how I loved you then  
  
Summer skies and lullabies  
Nights we couldn't say good-bye  
And of all of the things that we knew  
Not a dream survived  
  
Photographs and memories  
All the love you gave to me  
Somehow it just can't be true  
That's all I've left of you  
  
But we sure had a good time  
When we started way back when  
Morning walks and bedroom talks  
Oh how I loved you then

When I was a boy in the days of the train  
I'd sit by the tracks on a long summer day  
And I'd wave at the brakesman  
And he'd wave back at me  
While the thunderclouds rolled  
Out of East Tennessee  
  
But the dreams of a boy disappear when you're grown  
And though I may dream, the railroads are gone  
The ties they are rotten  
And the tracks shot to hell  
Along with my dreams and the old railroad bell  
  
In my dreams I ride the rails to California  
Workin' diners and farms along the way  
Or I'd hop a ride to hide across the border  
With a black eyed girl beside me all the way  
  
Now the mountains are silent  
And the railroads are gone  
And the coal towns no longer hear the miners at dawn  
But the train whistle shrills out her memories to me  
While the thunderclouds roll out of East Tennessee  
  
In my dreams I ride the rails to California  
Workin' diners and farms along the way  
Or I'd hop a ride to hide across the border  
With a black eyed girl beside me all the way  
  
Now the mountains are silent  
And the railroads are gone  
And the coal towns no longer hear the miners at dawn  
But the train whistle shrills out her memories to me  
While the thunderclouds roll out of East Tennessee

The railroads and the riverboats  
That bred the mighty men  
That we read about and we dream about  
The men who built this land  
And the farmers and the lumbermen  
And the men who work the mills  
And the poor hard workin' miners  
Who died inside the hill  
  
[Chorus]  
While the rivers that flow  
Are the blood of our land  
And the trucks they keep rumbling  
On the great concrete band  
And the railroads keep pushin'  
To be all they once were  
And nature is calling  
No one's listening to her  
  
And the immigrants by the boat load in a dozen different tongues  
Sang of freedom in the new land  
Climb the ladder rung by rung  
Some to Boston, some to Pittsburgh  
Philadelphia and St. Paul  
And the old ways led to new days  
They were welcome one and all  
  
[Chorus]  
  
With the railroads and the riverboats  
And the breadlines far behind  
And the days we sang together long gone but still in mind  
And the men who came before us  
Men who brought us to today  
And the story still unravels from the dreams of yesterday  
  
[Chorus]

Oh rapid roy that stock car boy  
He too much too believe  
You know he always got an extra pack of cigarettes  
Rolled up in his t-shirt sleeve  
He got a tattoo on his arm that say "baby"  
He got another one that just say "hey"  
But every sunday afternoon he is a dirt track demon  
In a '57 chevrolet  
  
Oh rapid roy that stock car boy  
He's the best driver in the land  
He say that he learned to race a stock car  
By runnin' shine outta alabam'  
Oh the demolition derby  
And the figure eight  
Is easy money in the bank  
Compared to runnin' from the man  
In oklahoma city  
With a 500 gallon tank  
  
Oh rapid roy that stock car boy  
He too much too believe  
You know he always got an extra pack of cigarettes  
Rolled up in his t-shirt sleeve  
He got a tattoo on his arm that say "baby"  
He got another one that just say "hey"  
And sunday afternoon he is a dirt track demon  
In a '57 chevrolet  
  
Yeah roy so cool  
That racin' fool he don't know what fear's about  
He do a hundred thirty mile an hour  
Smilin' at the camera  
With a toothpick in his mouth  
He got a girl back home  
Name of dixie dawn  
But he got honeys all along the way  
And you oughta hear 'em screamin'  
For that dirt track demon  
In a '57 chevrolet  
  
Oh rapid roy that stock car boy  
He too much too believe  
You know he always got an extra pack of cigarettes  
Rolled up in his t-shirt sleeve  
He got a tattoo on his arm that say "baby"  
He got another one that just say "hey"  
But every sunday afternoon he is a dirt track demon  
In a '57 chevrolet

Used to be that I could see  
A reason to be happy 'cause I was free  
But then recently it seems  
I've been lettin' your mem'ry get to me  
  
Used to be that I could pretend  
That I wasn't really hurt back then  
But then recently it seems  
I've been lettin' your mem'ry get to me  
  
'Cause mem'ries can be friends  
Or they can take you to a place  
The you never thought you'd be again  
And take you to a place  
That you never ever thought  
That you would see again  
  
'Cause mem'ries can be friends  
Or they can take you to a place  
The you never thought you'd be again  
And take you to a place  
That you never ever thought  
That you would see again  
  
Doesn't matter now who was wrong  
The future is tomorrow 'cause the past is gone  
And I'm findin' that I'm not as strong  
As I thought that I used to be  
'Cause recently it seems  
I've been lettin' your mem'ry get to me

Gonna tell you a story that you won't believe  
But I fell in love last Friday evenin'  
With a girl I saw on a bar room TV screen  
Well I was just gettin' ready to get my hat  
When she caught my eye and I put it back  
And I ordered myself a couple o' more shots and beers  
  
[Chorus]  
The night (you know) that I fell in love with a Roller Derby Queen  
(Round 'n' round, oh round 'n' round)  
The meanest hunk o' woman  
That anybody ever seen  
Down in the arena  
  
She is a five foot six and two fifteen  
A bleached-blonde mama with a streak of mean  
She knew how to knuckle  
And she knew how to scuffle and fight  
And the roller derby program said  
That she were built like a 'fridgerator with a head  
The fans called her "Tuffy"  
But all her buddies called her "Spike"  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Round 'n' round, go round 'n' round  
Round 'n' round, go round 'n' round  
Round 'n' round, go round 'n' round  
  
Well I could not help it but to fall in love  
With this heavy-duty woman I been speakin' of  
Things looked kind of bad  
Until the day she skated into my life  
  
Well she might be nasty she might be fat  
But I never met a person who would tell her that  
She's my big blonde bomber  
My heavy handed Hackensack mama  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Round 'n' round, go round 'n' round  
Round 'n' round, go round 'n' round  
Round 'n' round, go round 'n' round

I drive a broke down rig on "may-pop" tires  
Forty foot of overload  
A lot of people say that I'm crazy  
Because I don't know how to take it slow  
I got a broomstick on the throttle  
I got her opened up and head right down  
Nonstop back to Dallas  
Poppin' them West Coast turn-arounds  
  
[Chorus]  
And they call me Speedball  
Speedball Tucker  
Terror of the highways  
And all them other truckers  
Will tell you that the boy is mad  
To be drivin' a rig like that  
  
You know the rain may blow  
The snow may snow  
And the turnpikes they may freeze  
But they don't bother ol' Speedball  
He goin' any damn way he please  
He got a broomstick on the throttle  
To keep his throttle foot a-dancin' round  
With a cupful of cold black coffee  
And a pocketful of West Coast turn-arounds  
  
[Chorus]  
  
One day I looked into my rear view mirror  
And a-comin' up from behind  
There was a Georgia State policeman  
And a hundred dollar fine  
Well he looked me in the eye as he was writin' me up  
And said "Driver, you been flyin'"  
And "Ninety-five is the route you were on  
It was not the speed limit sign"  
  
[Chorus: x2]

Well I got my mail late last night  
A letter from a girl who found the time to write  
To her lonesome boy somewhere in the night  
She sent me a railroad ticket, too  
To take me to her loving arms  
And the big steel rail  
Gonna carry me home to the one I love  
  
Well I been up tight most every night  
Walking along the streets of this old town  
Not a friend to tell my troubles to  
My good old car she done broke down  
'Cause I drove it into the ground  
And the big steel rail gonna carry me home to the one I love  
  
Well look over yonder across the plain  
The big drive wheels a-pounding along the ground  
Gonna get on board and I'll be homeward bound  
Now I ain't had a home cooked meal  
And Lord I need one now  
And the big steel rail gonna carry me home to the one I love  
  
Well, I been out here many a long days  
I haven't found a place that I could call my own  
Not a two bit bed to lay my body on  
I been stood up I been shook down  
I bin dragged into the sand  
And the big steel rail gonna carry me home to the one I love  
  
Now here I am with my head in the sand  
Walking on the broad highway will you give a ride  
To a lonesome boy who missed the train last night  
I went in town for one last round  
And I gambled my ticket away  
And the big steel rail won't carry me home to the one I love

It's been too many years inside this prison  
Too many years just for one little fight  
He got what was comin'  
And I think I served enough time  
I'm goin' home tonight  
  
That stone looks mighty cold  
And the guard that walks that wall  
Is just waitin' to get a convict in his sights  
But if I can clear the top  
You can bet I'll never stop  
Cause I'm goin' home tonight  
  
Because stone walls do a prison  
Make iron bars a cage  
Any man who says they don't  
Never been inside  
Cause in time the bars get closer  
And at night the walls grow tighter  
Do you feel like there's a shackle around your mind?  
  
Now those guards are on my tail  
I can hear those sirens wail  
But I know that I'll get away and that I'll be alright  
Cause I'd rather live on the run  
Stand free in the morning sun  
Then to spend another lonely prison night  
  
Because stone walls do a prison  
Make iron bars a cage  
Any man who says they don't  
Never been inside  
Cause in time the bars get closer  
And at night the walls grow tighter  
Do you feel like there's a shackle around your mind?

I'm a dreamer by nature  
And I've always been tryin'  
To dream myself out of this world that I'm in  
In my dreams I escape all the troubles around  
And it hasn't cost a penny  
For the pleasures I've found  
  
What is the part  
That I'll play today  
Beggar, a business man, king for a day?  
I've played many parts  
And I'm the first to agree  
That I'm still lookin' round for the man that is me  
  
I'm a dreamer by nature  
And I've always been  
Looking for something not there  
My financial position  
Don't bother my dreams  
'Cause in fairy tale money  
I'm my own millionaire  
  
What is the part  
That I'll play today  
Beggar, a business man, king for a day?  
I've played many parts  
And I'm the first to agree  
That I'm still lookin' round for the man that is me  
  
I'm a rich man in dreams  
But in real life I've hid  
From the fact that I've got me a wife and a kid  
If I lose what I've got  
Then they lose it too  
Tell me what in this world's a poor dreamer to do  
  
What is the part  
That I'll play today  
Beggar, a bus'ness man, king for a day?  
I've played many parts  
And I'm the first to agree  
That I'm still lookin' round for the man that is me

Pickin' wasn't easy  
Kept you brown and thin  
Been a child for every season  
That the fruit was on the limb  
  
Pack the truck Maria  
Tell the kids, we're off again  
Cross a dozen states or more  
We'll teach 'em what we can  
  
Teach 'em what we can  
We can't do more  
The land is good  
But still the livin's poor  
  
Harvest in September  
Drought in mid July  
January's peeking  
Through a white lace gypsy sky  
  
March rolls into April  
Then plant and pray for rain  
Sweat like hell in August  
Run the circle once again  
  
Run the circle once again  
And then once more  
The land is good  
But still the livin's poor  
  
Oregon in August  
Michigan in May  
Tryin' to make enough  
To keep my family on its way  
  
And buy the pickin' boss a drink  
To keep working every day  
You know it isn't honest  
But you do it anyway  
  
Do it anyway  
To keep alive  
Do it anyway to keep alive

The last face that I looked on  
Can't recall too much about  
The image of it left me  
Each time the lights went out  
The last mind that I wandered  
I remember how I ran  
Just to find the road had ended  
Just where it began  
  
The next man that I marry  
There ain't nothin' he won't do  
Most likely love me too much  
  
The next hands that I hide in  
Will be warm and dry as smoke  
Just as satisfied to hold me  
As to dust my winter coat  
The next soul that I sleep in  
Will be soft as summer rain  
And when I need more lovin'  
He'll love me once again  
  
The next man that I marry  
There ain't nothin' he won't do  
Most likely love me too much  
  
The next man that I marry  
There ain't nothin' he won't do  
Most likely love me too much  
Just like you

Once we were lovers  
But somehow things have changed  
Now we're just lonely people  
Trying to forget each other's names  
Now we're just lonely people  
Trying to forget each other's names  
  
[Chorus]  
What came between us?  
Maybe we were just too young to know  
But now and then  
I feel the same,  
And sometimes at night I think  
I hear you calling my name  
Mm, mm, mm, these dreams  
They keep me going these days  
  
Once we were lovers  
But that was long ago  
We lived together then  
And now we do not even say hello  
We lived together then  
And now we do not even say hello  
  
[Chorus: x2]

This land is your land  
This land is my land  
From California to the New York Island  
From the redwood forest  
To the Gulf Stream waters  
This land was made for you and me  
  
As I was walking that ribbon of highway  
I saw above me that golden skyway  
I saw below me the golden valley  
This land was made for you and me  
  
The sun was shinin' and I was strollin'  
The wheat fields waving, the dust clouds rolling  
And all around me a voice was singing  
You know that this land was made for you and me  
  
This land is your land  
This land is my land  
From California to the New York Island  
From the redwood forest  
To the Gulf Stream waters  
This land was made for you and me  
  
This land was made for you and me  
This land was made for you and me

Well it started out just like a dream  
And like a dream I knew  
That what we had would have to end  
I was looking for a life-time lover  
  
And you were looking for a friend  
Someone to be there  
After all your nighttime lovers had gone  
The way they came  
  
Someone who knew the way  
To help you play  
Your daytime game  
It's not the same  
  
Well, I started out pretending  
That I ought to mean enough to you  
To make you want to change  
Then I came to realize  
  
That there was just too much of you  
You had to rearrange  
And I couldn't bear to wait around  
For all your nighttime lovers to go  
  
The way they came  
And it came to hurt too much for me  
To have to play your daytime games  
No one to blame  
  
It started out just like a dream  
And like a dream I knew  
That what we had had to end  
I was looking for a life-time lover  
  
And you were looking for a friend  
I was looking for a life-time lover  
And you were looking for a friend

If I could save time in a bottle  
The first thing that I'd like to do  
Is to save every day  
'Til eternity passes away  
Just to spend them with you  
  
If I could make days last forever  
If words could make wishes come true  
I'd save every day like a treasure and then,  
Again, I would spend them with you  
  
[Chorus]  
But there never seems to be enough time  
To do the things you want to do  
Once you find them  
I've looked around enough to know  
That you're the one I want to go  
Through time with  
  
If I had a box just for wishes  
And dreams that had never come true  
The box would be empty  
Except for the memory  
Of how they were answered by you  
  
[Chorus]

Well, I'm sorry for the things that I told you  
But words only go so far  
And if I had my way  
I would reach into heaven  
And I'd pull down a star for a present  
And I'd make you a chain out of diamonds  
And pearls from a summer sea  
But all I can give you is a kiss in the morning  
And a sweet apology  
  
Well, I know that it hasn't been easy  
And I haven't always been around  
To say the right words  
Or to hold you in the mornin'  
Or to help you when you're down  
I know I never showed you much of a good time  
But baby things are gonna change  
I'm gonna make up for all of the hurt I brought  
I'm gonna love away all your pain  
  
And tomorrow's gonna be a brighter day  
There's gonna be some changes  
Tomorrow's gonna be a brighter day  
This time you can believe me  
No more cryin' in your lonely room  
And no more empty nights  
'Cause tomorrow mornin' everything will turn out right  
  
Well, there's something that I've got to tell you  
Yes I've got something on my mind  
But words come hard  
When your lying in my arms  
And when I'm looking deep into your eyes  
But there's truth and consolation  
And what I'm trying to say  
Is that nobody ever had a rainbow baby  
Until he had the rain  
  
It's gonna, it's gonna, it's gonna be a brighter day  
It's gonna, it's gonna, it's gonna be a brighter day  
It's gonna, it's gonna, it's gonna be a brighter day  
It's gonna be, it's gonna be, it's gonna be a brighter day  
It's gonna be, it's gonna be, it's gonna be a brighter day  
Come on tomorrow  
Come on tomorrow  
It's gonna be a brighter day

I'd like to think about her  
And the way she used to love me  
But I just can't live without her  
'Cause her arms are not around me  
And the season's getting later  
And my body's getting colder  
And the vespers ring and I'm all alone  
Without my love beside me  
  
She'd call me in the evenin'  
And ask me to come over  
She'd be standing by the window  
With her hair down around her shoulder  
We'd talk a while and then she'd smile  
Then she'd lock the door  
And she would sit beside me  
And we would talk no more  
  
The bells would ring at six o'clock  
And she'd be in my arms  
Her head upon my shoulder, gently resting  
And then she'd wake and look at me  
Not knowing I'd been watching  
Kiss me softly, then drift off to sleep  
  
She'd call me in the evenin'  
And ask me to come over  
She'd be standing by the window  
With her hair down around her shoulder  
We'd talk a while and then she'd smile  
Then she'd lock the door  
And she would sit beside me  
And we would talk no more

How come we can't talk the way we used to do?  
Nothing seems to be the same  
Have we forgotten all the things we knew  
Was it you or I who changed?  
We got to find the answer, let the secrets fly  
Enough of telling stories and our well meaning lies  
Things don't seem to be the same no matter how I tried  
There's no rhythm to the rain  
Wind still whispers through the leaves on high  
But they no longer sing your name  
We got to find the answer, let the secrets fly  
Enough of telling stories and our well meaning lies  
We got to try to build what we had in the past  
Trying's half the battle if we lose it, we can't last  
I heard myself just say the things, I could never say before  
And listen to the rhythm of the rain  
Wind just whispered through the leaves on high  
And I thought, I heard them sing your name  
We got to find the answer, let the secrets fly  
Enough of telling stories and our well meaning lies  
We got to try to build what we had in the past  
Trying's half the battle if we lose it, we can't last  
I heard myself just say the things I could never say before  
And listen to the rhythm of the rain  
Wind just whispered through the leaves on high  
And I thought, I heard them sing your name  
And I thought, I heard them sing your name  

There's ice and snow on the northern roads  
And the Jersey Pike is closed  
Have to go and do some drivin' tonight  
They say I'd be a fool if I would ride those icy roads  
But a little storm ain't stoppin' me tonight  
  
I'm gonna wear out the turnpike  
Rack up those miles  
Keep this rig a rollin', I'm in it every mile  
'Cause she's in Oklahoma and  
I'm up in Maine  
So diesel sing a song that will bring me home again  
Doodle doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo  
Doodle doo doo doo  
  
There's a red light turnin' behind me  
There's a trooper on my tail  
I can tell I won't get to New York town on time  
If he decides to pull me over  
And if he get's me on the scale  
I'm gonna have to tell a tale or take a fine  
  
I'm gonna wear out the turnpike  
Rack up those miles  
Keep this rig a rollin', I'm in it every mile  
'Cause she's in Oklahoma and  
I'm up in Maine  
So diesel sing a song that will bring me home again  
Doodle doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo  
Doodle doo doo doo  
  
With the snow against my windshield  
I will run on through the night  
There's not stoppin' me once I hit the road  
Cause the turnpike's like my second home  
And I know it like my hand  
So diesel sing a song that'll bring me home again  
  
I'm gonna wear out the turnpike  
Rack up those miles  
Keep this rig a rollin', I'm in it every mile  
'Cause she's in Oklahoma and  
I'm up in Maine  
So diesel sing a song that will bring me home again  
Doodle doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo  
Doodle doo doo doo

Tell me, what do people do  
When there ain't nothin' to do?  
When there's nobody else around to do  
Nothin' with or to  
Have you ever been in that position in a small town motel room  
Where the diners all close at nine  
And the trucks keep a rollin' by  
And you just can't get to sleep  
Even though there's nothin' on your mind?  
  
Tell me what do people say  
When there ain't nothin' to say?  
When there's nobody else around to help you pass the time of day  
Have you ever stared at the ceiling  
Till you thought you'd lose your mind  
Looked for a wall that you could climb  
Still you just can't get to sleep  
Even tho' there's nothin' on your mind?  
  
Have you ever been stuck in a small town motel  
Lookin' all around but there ain't nothin' to see  
In a never endin' mind bendin', troublin' position  
Sayin' why did it happen to me?  
  
Tell me, what do people do  
When there ain't nothin' to do?  
When there's nobody else around to do  
Nothin' with or to  
Have you ever been in that position in a small town motel room  
Where the diners all close at nine  
And the trucks keep a rollin' by  
And you just can't get to sleep  
Even though there's nothin' on your mind?  
  
Tell me, what do people do  
When there ain't nothin' to do?  
When there's nobody else around to do  
Nothin' with or to  
Hope you never in that position in a small town motel room  
Where the diners all close at nine  
And the trucks keep a rollin' by  
Till you just can't get to sleep  
Even though there's nothin' on your mind?

Oh my room will always have some people  
You see Johnny Carson is a friend of mine  
And my music box will always play me something  
If something's what I need to ease my mind  
Take what you want  
I'll feel much better  
Don't hang around  
Till I get myself together  
You can leave those pieces right there where they fell  
Someone else will come along and pick 'em up  
Say what the hell  
  
If I don't see you in the morning  
Guess the sun might come up anyway  
And without you here to love and stand beside me  
Guess I just might make it through the day  
If you should call from time to time  
Don't be surprised  
If the voice that answers ain't mine  
'Cause you left the pieces right there where they fell  
Someone else just came along and picked 'em up  
Say what the hell  
  
If you should call from time to time  
Don't be surprised  
If the voice that answers ain't mine  
'Cause you left those pieces right there where they fell  
Someone else just came along and picked 'em up  
Say what the hell  
  
If she don't love me come tomorrow  
If you can't get what you want, want what you got  
And I won't be drugged with words like joy and sorrow  
I won't feel one way or the other  
Like as not  
I'll soon forget you  
Leave my life  
Guess you thought I'd never let you  
'Cause you left those pieces right there where they fell  
Someone else just came along and picked 'em up  
Say what the hell

Which way are you going?  
Which side will you be on?  
Will you stand and watch  
While all the seeds of hate are sown  
Will you stand with those who say  
"Let his will be done?"  
  
One hand on the bible  
One hand on the gun  
One hand on the bible  
One hand on the gun  
  
Which way are you looking  
Is it hard to see?  
Do you say  
"What's wrong for him is not wrong for me?"  
You walk the streets  
Righteousness but you refuse to understand  
  
You say you love the baby  
Then you crucify the man  
You say you love the baby  
Then you crucify the man  
  
Everyday things are changing  
Words once honored turned to lies  
People wondering, can you blame them  
It's too far to run and too late to hide  
  
Now you turn your back on  
All the things that you used to preach  
Now it's, "Let him live in freedom, if he lives like me"  
Well, your light has changed, confusion rains  
What have you become  
  
All your olive branches turned to spears  
When your flowers turned to guns  
Your olive branches turned to spears  
When your flowers turned to guns

Well, I had just got out from the county prison  
Doin' ninety days for non-support  
Tried to find me an executive position  
But no matter how smooth I talked  
  
They wouldn't listen to the fact that I was a genius  
The man say, "We got all that we can use."  
Now I got them steadily depressin', low down mind messin'  
Working at the car wash blues  
  
Well, I should be sittin' in an air conditioned office in a swivel chair  
Talkin' some trash to the secretaries  
Sayin', "Here, now mama, come on over here."  
Instead, I'm stuck here rubbin' these fenders with a rag  
  
And walkin' home in soggy old shoes  
With them steadily depressin', low down mind messin'  
Workin' at the car wash blues  
You know a man of my ability  
  
He should be smokin' on a big cigar  
But till I get myself straight I guess I'll just have to wait  
In my rubber suit a-rubbin' these cars  
Well, all I can do is a shake my head  
  
You might not believe that it's true  
For workin' at this end of Niagara Falls  
Is an undiscovered Howard Hughes  
So baby, don't expect to see me  
  
With no double martini in any high-brow society news  
Cause I got them steadily depressin', low down mind messin'  
Workin' at the car wash blues  
So baby, don't expect to see me  
  
With no double martini in any high-brow society news  
'Cause I got them steadily depressin', low down mind messin'  
Workin' at the car wash blues  
Yeah I got them steadily depressin', low down mind messin'  
Workin' at the car wash blues

Uptown got it's hustlers  
The bowery got it's bums  
42nd street got big jim walker  
He's a pool-shootin' son of a gun  
Yeah, he big and dumb as a man can come  
But he stronger than a country hoss  
And when the bad folks all get together at night  
You know they all call big jim "boss", just because  
And they say  
  
You don't tug on superman's cape  
You don't spit into the wind  
You don't pull the mask off that old lone ranger  
And you don't mess around with Jim  
  
Well outta south Alabama came a country boy  
He say I'm lookin' for a man named Jim  
I am a pool-shootin' boy  
My name Willie McCoy  
But down home they call me slim  
Yeah I'm lookin' for the king of 42nd street  
He drivin' a drop top cadillac  
Last week he took all my money  
And it may sound funny  
But I come to get my money back  
And everybody say jack don't you know  
  
And you don't tug on superman's cape  
You don't spit into the wind  
You don't pull the mask off that old lone ranger  
And you don't mess around with jim  
  
Well a hush fell over the pool room  
Jimmy come boppin' in off the street  
And when the cuttin' were done  
The only part that wasn't bloody  
Was the soles of the big man's feet  
Yeah he were cut in in bout a hundred places  
And he were shot in a couple more  
And you better believe  
They sung a different kind of story  
When big Jim hit the floor now they say  
  
You don't tug on superman's cape  
You don't spit into the wind  
You don't pull the mask off that old lone ranger  
And you don't mess around with slim  
  
Yeah, big Jim got his hat  
Find out where it's at  
And it's not hustlin' people strange to you  
Even if you do got a two-piece custom-made pool cue  
  
Yeah you don't tug on superman's cape  
You don't spit into the wind  
You don't pull the mask off the old lone ranger  
And you don't mess around with slim
