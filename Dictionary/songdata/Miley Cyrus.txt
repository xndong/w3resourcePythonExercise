[Verse 1:]  
We all walk around  
And waste life  
It's just gonna go on forever  
Like there's some eternal endless supply  
Of what it takes to keep us alive  
There might be a day  
When everything goes away  
To remind us how ungrateful our culture is  
We need to take time  
To replace what's stolen from Mother Nature  
  
[Hook:]  
We only have  
1 sun, 1 moon, 1 me  
1 you  
And we only have a little time to show how much we love  
The sun (the sun) the moon (the moon)  
How much I really love you  
We only have a little bit of time (time, time, time)  
  
[Verse 2:]  
I once heard  
Grace Jones say  
I have my own concept of time  
I always think bout' that cause I've always felt like  
I was running a little behind  
What's in front of me  
I don't know  
Cause I can't see what hasn't started to grow  
  
[Hook:]  
We only have  
1 sun, 1 moon, 1 me  
1 you  
And we only have a little time to show how much we love  
The sun (the sun) the moon (the moon)  
How much I really love you  
We only have a little bit of time (time, time, time)  
  
[Verse 3:]  
Wake up, world  
Can't you see the earth is crying?  
Wake up, world  
Can't you see all the clouds are dying?  
And maybe one day there won't be rainbows  
Grass won't be green and the sky won't be blue  
I don't wanna see a cyclone  
There's no sun, no moon, no me, no you  
  
[Hook:]  
We only have  
1 sun, 1 moon, 1 me  
1 you  
And we only have a little time to show how much we love  
The sun (the sun) the moon (the moon)  
How much I really love you  
We only have a little bit of time (time, time, time)

Sha, sha, sha  
  
I probably shouldn't say this  
But at times I get so scared  
When I think about the previous  
Relationship we shared  
It was awesome, but we lost it  
It's not possible for me not to care  
And now we're standing in the rain  
But nothing's ever gonna change until you hear  
My dear  
  
The seven things I hate about you  
The seven things I hate about you  
Oh, you  
You're vain, your games, you're insecure  
You love me, you like her  
You made me laugh, you made me cry, I don't know which side to buy  
Your friends, they're jerks, and when you act like them, just know it hurts  
I wanna be with the one I know  
And the seventh thing I hate the most that you do  
You make me love you  
  
It's awkward and it's silent  
As I wait for you to say  
But what I need to hear now your sincere apology  
When you mean it, I'll believe it If you text it I'll delete it  
Let's be clear  
Oh, I'm not coming back  
You're taking seven steps here  
  
The seven things I hate about you  
You're vain, your games, you're insecure  
You love me, you like her  
You made me laugh, you made me cry, I don't know which side to buy  
Your friends, they're jerks, and when you act like them, just know it hurts  
I wanna be with the one I know  
And the seventh thing I hate the most that you do  
You make me love you  
  
Compared to all the great things  
That would take too long to write  
I probably should mention  
The seven that I like  
  
The seven things I like about you  
Your hair, your eyes, your old Levi's  
When we kiss, I'm hypnotized  
You made me laugh, you made me cry, but I guess that's both that I'll have to
buy  
Your hand in mine when we're intertwined, everything's alright  
I wanna be with the one I know  
And the seventh thing I like the most that you do  
You make me love you  
  
Sha, sha, you do, oh

I was looking for a good time  
I was down so low thought I'd never get up  
Then a midnight lady with eyes of green  
Said she didn't look much older than seventeen  
She said, I'll take you to a place  
That you've never seen  
If your lookin' for a good time  
Lookin' for a good time  
Lookin' for a good time  
  
She took me away downtown  
To a smoky cafe called Barefoot George  
There were other people walking  
Then she knocked three times  
She whispered to a guy he's a friend of mine  
Said take off your shoes and come on inside  
If your lookin' for a good time  
Lookin' for a good time  
Lookin' for a good time  
  
Well the lights when on  
And the lights when off  
And the music stopped  
And a man grabbed me from behind  
And said ya just got caught  
Well your under age and this here's a raid  
I should take ya in  
I'm gonna to do you a favor and let ya go  
Don't ya let me catch you round here no more  
Looking for a good time  
Looking for a good time  
Looking for a good time  
  
When I got home with my bare feet  
Daddy said he should have put me over his knee  
And asked me where I've been till a quarter to three  
Said looking for a good time  
Looking for a good time  
Looking for a good time  
Looking for a good time

Ah, hey, ah oh  
  
Baby, baby yeah, are you listenin'?  
Wondering, where you've been, all my life  
I just started living  
Oh, baby are you listenin' oh?  
  
When you say you love me  
Know I love you more  
When you say you need me  
Know I need you more  
Boy I adore you,  
I adore you  
  
Baby, can ya hear me?  
When I'm crying out, for you,  
I'm scared oh, so scared,  
When you're near me  
I feel like I'm standing with an army  
Of men armed with weapons, hey oh  
  
When you say you love me  
Know I love you more  
When you say you need me  
Know I need you more  
Boy I adore you,  
I adore you  
  
I love lying next to you  
I could do this for eternity,  
You and me, were meant to be in holy matrimony  
God knew exactly what he was doing  
When he lead me to you  
  
When you say you love me  
Know I love you more  
When you say you need me  
Know I need you more  
Boy I adore you,  
I adore you  
  
When you say you love me  
Know I love you more  
When you say you need me  
Know I need you more  
Boy I adore you,  
I adore you

I don't want a lot for Christmas  
There is just one thing I need  
I don't care about presents  
Underneath the Christmas tree  
I just want you for my own  
More than you could ever know  
Make my wish come true  
All I want for Christmas is you.  
  
I don't want a lot for Christmas  
There is just one thing I need  
I don't care about presents  
Underneath the Christmas tree  
I don't need to hang my stocking  
There upon the fireplace  
Santa Claus won't make me happy  
With a toy on Christmas day  
I just want you for my own  
More than you could ever know  
Make my wish come true  
All I want for Christmas is you  
  
I won't ask for much this Christmas  
I won't even wish for snow  
I'm just gonna keep on waiting  
Underneath the mistletoe  
I won't make a list and send it  
To the North Pole for Saint Nick  
I won't even stay awake to  
Hear those magic reindeer click  
'Cause I just want you here tonight  
Holding on to me so tight  
What more can I do  
All I want for Christmas is you  
  
All the lights are shining  
Brightly everywhere  
And the sound of  
Laughter fills the air  
And everyone is singing  
I hear those sleigh bells ringing  
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need  
Won't you please bring my baby to me  
  
I don't want a lot for Christmas  
This is all I'm asking for  
I just want to see my baby  
Standing right outside my door  
I just want him for my own  
More than you could ever know  
Make my wish come true  
Baby all I want for Christmas is  
You  
You  
You  
Yeah you  
You

I've been tongue tied  
A little shy  
But you're the reason why  
I've been nervous  
Inside  
But you're the reason why  
Because  
  
(Chorus:)  
I'm just sitting here thinking  
Thinking about you  
Thinking about your every move  
As you can see  
Lately  
You've been on my mind  
All the time  
  
You got me frozen  
With your smile  
Staring in your eyes  
  
It's just a crush  
I know this  
But I know it's  
Hopeless  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Oh yeah  
You're pretty much  
Always on my mind  
On my mind, yeah  
I think about you  
Constantly  
I'd love it if you'd  
Love me  
But  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
All the time  
Yeah

Gonna stay in bed today  
'cause I can't stand the light  
Don't know why I get so down  
  
I won't be much fun tonight  
And I can't believe  
You still want to hang around me  
  
It's not so pretty all the time  
You don't mind  
To you it's alright  
  
As I am is how you take me  
Never try to push or make me different  
When I talk you listen to me  
  
As I am is how you want me and  
I know I've found the pieces missing  
I'm looking at him  
  
I'm not the girl you think you see  
But maybe that's a lie  
You almost know me better than  
Me, myself and I  
  
Don't know a lot of things  
But I know what I got  
It's not so perfect everyday  
I don't have to try  
'cause it all falls into place  
  
As I am is how you take me  
Never try to push or make me different  
When I talk you listen to me  
  
As I am is how you want me and  
I know I've found the pieces missing  
I'm looking at him  
  
Face to face, eye to eye  
You're standing there  
Feels good on the inside  
  
I don't mind, I don't care  
You're standing there  
Seein' me for the first time  
  
Seein' me for the first time  
Seein' me for the first time  
  
As I am is how you take me  
Never try to push or make me different  
When I talk you listen to me  
  
As I am is how you want me and  
I know I've found the pieces missing  
I'm looking at him  
  
Found the pieces missing  
Take me as I am  
When I talk you listen  
Take me as I am  
  
Found the pieces missing  
Take me as I am

[Verse 1]  
I sleep with the door open if you want to come in while I'm sleeping  
I'm always sleeping naked in case you wake up and you're creeping  
Want to lick it so much that it's almost like I taste it on the tip of my
tongue  
I want to touch it so bad that it's almost like I can feel it on my fingertips  
I want yours inside of me, but don't forget where I like licking baby  
I want to make your fantasies reality I want to be yours baby  
  
[Hook]  
I want you to bang my box  
I want you to bang my box  
  
[Verse 2]  
There ain't nothing that I'm scared to try  
I can be on top or if you like it I'll just lie here  
Take my picture position my body  
Wherever you like just know that I like it naughty  
Teach me a lesson pretend we never met  
But we can't keep just kissing cause you're getting me so wet  
The only downside to this morning is you getting up and you leaving  
When I'm dreaming and you're in 'em I wake myself up cause I'm screaming  
What are you doing to me  
It's like you're a zookeeper setting animals free  
You release me like a tiger that's been locked in a cage  
Here I am, here you are  
I want it so hard  
You finger my heart  
And I know just what I need, what I came here to do  
I've been thinking baby, been mostly about you  
  
[Hook]  
I want you to bang my box  
I want you to bang my box  
  
[Outro]  
You say it tastes like cake with my lips against your face I want you to eat
it baby

[Verse 1]  
Alright, so this is really fucked up, but  
Alright, I was sleeping next to him but I was dreaming about the other dude  
And then all of a sudden, everything that he fucking did just made me cringe
and it was so hard to fall in but so easy just to fall back right out again  
This whole time, I could give to you and I could paint you pictures but I
guess I could just never write a song and then maybe I'd never fell out of
love with him in the first place  
I mean, I, I don't wanna feel this feeling cause my energy's just so strong
that, I don't know if I'm creating this or this is actually what is meant to
be  
And you know that, they say that you gotta think what you want into existence,
but you know, I haven't been too good at making decisions so, I have no idea
what the fuck I want, I guess  
  
[Chorus 1]  
You're giving me a feeling in my head  
Laying in my bed just thinking  
Not really feeling like the one I want  
Takes everything in me not to call him  
I really, really, really want it, too  
I told all my friends I'm moving on  
Your baby talk is creeping me out  
Fuck me so you stop baby talking  
  
[Verse 2]  
You know what, in the beginning it was like we were fucking homies and shit
and then all of a sudden you started with some fucking baby goo-goo tongue
down my fucking throat  
I mean, even in front of your mom  
Dude, as if I'm not fucking awkward enough  
I mean, you put me in these fucking situations where I look like a dumbass
bitch and I'm not a fucking dumbass bitch  
You know, like, I hate all that fucking PDA, I probably hate it more than your
fucking friends do  
You know, it's sweet and you couldn't be more opposite of my last dickhead
but, you know I just, I don't know if I can get over the fucking goo  
  
[Chorus 2]  
You keep saying again and again  
We're laying in my bed just talking  
And now I, now I can't hold it back  
I'm feeling like I'm gonna vomit  
I don't really want to let go of you  
I heard I change my mind with you often  
Baby talk is creeping me out  
Fuck me so you stop baby talking  
  
[Verse 3]  
Alright, so, I'm gonna be honest  
It's the super cutey shit, that's the main issue here  
I mean, I'm fucking what?  
Look, I like when you send me, you know, the, the queen emoji, but when I send
back the monkey, you know, the ones with the, the hands over the eyes? That
means that shit's just getting a little too weird for me  
I mean, I don't wanna say it person, I just bury my head in your armpit
which... weirdly smells good and your hair and your fucking teeth  
Like, why the fuck would I wanna lick your teeth but I do  
And remember there was that one time that I had like a 15 minute...  
Well, that was kind of the best thing in the entire world  
You know, maybe I could just get past this shit and I could get used to
someone giving a fuck  
I'm sorry I called you a creep and that thing about the vomit  
I mean, look, I'm really starting to be in this whole thing, but no matter
what you do, homegirl can't handle the fucking goo  
  
[Chorus 3]  
Fuck me so you stop baby talking  
Fuck me so you stop baby talking  
Fuck me so you stop baby talking  
Fuck me so you stop baby talking  
I don't really want [?] you  
I heard I change my mind with you often  
Baby talk is creeping me out  
Fuck me so you stop baby talking

Every time it rains  
I think of you  
I think about the sparkle  
In your eyes  
Something 'bout the rain  
That brings beauty  
To everything  
  
[Chorus:]  
You and me  
We'll go dancing  
(Dancing in the rain)  
You look at me  
With your big beautiful  
And it's so gorgeous  
And it's so wonderful  
It's beautiful  
  
I was standing there  
Shyly  
  
And you came up to me  
You said  
"Would like to dance?"  
And fearlessly  
I said yes  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Oh the rain  
Oh the pain  
I don't care  
As long as I'm with you  
Oh the rain  
Oh the pain  
I still love you  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Oh ooh oh  
It's Beautiful

I know this isn't what I wanted  
I never thought it'd come this far  
Just thinking back to where we started  
And how we lost all that we are  
We were young and times were easy  
But I could see it's not the same  
I'm standing here but you don't see me  
Give it all for that to change  
  
I don't want  
To lose her  
Don't let her go  
  
[Chorus]  
Standing out in the rain  
Need to know if it's over  
Cause I would leave you alone  
Flooded with all this pain  
Knowing that I'll never hold her  
Like I did before the storm  
  
Yeah  
Before the storm  
  
With every strike of lightening  
Comes a memory that lasts  
And not a word is left unspoken  
As a thunder starts to crash  
Maybe I should give up  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Trying to keep  
The light from going out  
And the clouds were ripping out my broken heart  
They always say  
A heart is not a home  
Without the one who gets you through the storm  
  
[Chorus]

Oh yeah  
Come on  
  
You get the limo out front (ohohoh)  
Hottest styles, every shoe, every color  
Yeah when you're famous it can be kinda fun  
It's really you but no one ever discovers  
  
In some ways you're just like all your friends  
But on stage you're a star  
  
You get the best of both worlds  
Chill it out, take it slow  
Then you rock out the show  
You get the best of both worlds  
Mix it all together  
And you know that it's the best of both worlds  
  
The best of both worlds  
  
You go to movie premiers (is that Orlando Bloom?)  
Hear your songs on the radio  
Livin' two lives is a little weird (yeah)  
But school's cool 'cause nobody knows [nobody knows]  
  
Yeah you get to be a small town girl  
But big time when you play your guitar  
  
You get the best of both worlds  
Chill it out, take it slow  
Then you rock out the show  
You get the best of both worlds  
Mix it all together  
And you know that it's the best of both  
You know the best of both worlds  
  
Pictures and autographs  
You get your face in all the magazines  
The best part is that  
You get to be whoever you wanna be  
  
Best... Best... Yeah the best of both  
Best... Best... You got the best of both  
Best... Best... C'mon the best of both  
  
Who would have thought that a girl like me  
Would double as a super staaaaaaaaaaaaaaar  
Woo!  
You get the best of both worlds  
Chill it out, take it slow  
Then you rock out the show  
You get the best of both worlds  
Mix it all together  
And you know that it's the best  
You get the best of both worlds  
Without the shades and the hair  
You can go anywhere  
You get the best of both worlds  
Mix it all together... Oh yeah  
It's so much better  
'Cause you know you've got  
The best of both girls

(L. O. V. E. Love, L. O. V. E...)  
  
I see your face, I look in your eyes,  
What you feel is no surprise,  
Everyone needs something to believe in,  
Tell me your dreams, I'll tell you mine,  
In our hearts we'll look inside,  
And see all of the colors of the rainbow,  
I know!  
  
[Chorus:]  
We all want to believe in love,  
We all want to believe in something,  
Bigger than just us,  
We all want to be a part,  
Of the greater picture,  
That's hangin' in our hearts,  
Yeah it's bigger than us!  
  
I want to see beyond my own little world,  
Grab your hands so we can twirl around the galaxy,  
See the world with clarity,  
Oh-oo-oh,  
We all have a long way to go,  
But I know,  
We're getting closer everyday,  
Everyday!  
  
[Chorus:]  
We all want to believe in love,  
We all want to believe in something,  
Bigger than just us,  
We all want to be a part,  
Of the greater picture,  
That's hangin' in our heart,  
Yeah bigger than us!  
  
It fills the universe,  
It lights the skies above,  
It rescues our hearts with love,  
  
(L. O. V. E, love)with love! (l. O. V. E, love)  
That's what's bigger than us! (bigger than us, c'mon)  
  
It's love, it's love, that's bigger than us  
  
It's love, it's love, that's bigger than us  
(Whoo!)  
It's love, it's love! (it's love, it's love!)  
  
We all want to believe in love,  
  
We all want to believe in something,  
  
Bigger than just us!

You tuck me in,  
Turn out the light  
Kept me safe and sound at night  
Little girls depend on things like that  
  
Brushed my teeth and combed my hair  
Had to drive me everywhere  
You were always there when I looked back  
  
You had to do it all alone  
Make a living, make a home  
Must have been as hard as it could be  
  
And when I couldn't sleep at night  
Scared things wouldn't turn out right  
You would hold my hand and sing to me  
  
Caterpillar in the tree, how you wonder who you'll be  
Can't go far but you can always dream  
Wish you may and wish you might  
Don't you worry hold on tight.  
I promise you there will come a day  
Butterfly Fly Away  
Butterfly Fly Away (butterfly fly away)  
  
Flap your wing now you can't stay  
Take those dreams and make them all come true  
Butterfly Fly Away (butterfly fly away)  
We been waiting for this day  
All along and know just what to do  
Butterfly,  
Butterfly,  
Butterfly,  
Butterfly Fly Away  
  
(Butterfly Fly Away)  
  
(Butterfly Fly Away)

Like a Mafia  
For those who don't know me  
I can get a bit crazy  
Have to get my way yep  
Twenty four hours a day  
'Cause I'm hot like that  
  
Every guy, everywhere  
Just gives me mad attention  
Like I'm under inspection  
I always get a ten  
'Cause I'm built like that  
  
I go through guys like  
Money flying out the hands  
They try to change me  
But they realize they can't  
And every tomorrow is a day I never plan  
If you're gonna be my man understand  
  
[Chorus]  
I can't be tamed  
I can't be tamed  
I can't be blamed  
I can't can't  
I can't be tamed  
I can't be changed  
I can't be tamed  
I can't be, can't be tamed  
  
If there is a question about my intentions  
I'll tell ya  
I'm not here to sell ya  
Or tell you to go to hell  
I'm not a brat like that  
I'm like a puzzle  
But all of my pieces are jagged  
If you can understand this  
We can make some magic  
I'm wrong like that  
  
I wanna fly  
I wanna drive  
I wanna go  
I wanna be a part of something I don't know  
And if you try to hold me back I might explode  
Baby, by now you should know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well I'm not a trick you play  
I'm wired a different way  
I'm not a mistake  
I'm not a fake  
It's set in my DNA  
Don't change me  
Don't change me  
Don't change me  
Don't change me  
(I can't be tamed)  
  
I wanna fly  
I wanna drive  
I wanna go  
I wanna be a part of something I don't know  
And if you try to hold me back I might explode  
Baby, by now you should know  
  
[Chorus]

Chorus:The best of both worlds:

It's six a.m. and I'm wide awake  
'Cause I can't stop thinking  
About the stuff you'll say  
And me and I, I can't let it slide  
The paper's not here yet the sun's not up  
But I'm not afraid to tell you what I feel inside  
I had one of those dreams that make it all so  
Clear to me now  
I got a whole new perspective  
It's so clear to me now  
You can't treat me that way  
It appears to me  
How long you tried to make me think  
It was me who was being the fake  
So clear  
Why did I smile when I hurt inside?  
Said I was okay when I knew it's a lie  
I wanted to believe in you  
You took your chances and one was me  
So I'll just forgive you and set you free  
I'm on my way  
Yeah I'm stepping out of the haze  
And it's so clear to me now  
I got a whole new perspective  
It's so clear to me now  
You can't treat me that way  
It appears to me  
How long you tried to make me think  
It was me who was being the fake  
So clear  
I wanna put the past behind  
Try and maybe I can find better days  
The first time in a while  
Think I even feel a smile on my face  
I got a whole new perspective  
You can't treat me that way  
It's so clear to me now  
I got a whole new perspective  
It's so clear to me now  
You can't treat me that way  
It appears to me  
How long you tried to make me think  
It was me who was being the fake  
So clear  
Yeah, so clear  
So clear, so clear  
Ooh  
Sun's going down on a Saturday  
And I feel all right, I feel okay  

Hey girl  
Take off your makeup  
I know you wanna  
Look beautiful for him  
But,  
If he really loved you  
He would love you the same  
  
[Chorus:]  
Girl  
You could have  
A closet full of clothes  
You could have  
A million dollars  
You could have 10, 000 roses  
But in the end  
He'll still love you  
For you  
If he's true  
  
Girl  
You don't have to wear  
Fancy clothes and  
Diamond rings  
You should be yourself  
Not someone you're not  
He will love you in the end  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Yeah  
A closet full of clothes  
A million dollars  
10, 000 roses  
Fancy clothes  
Diamond rings  
He will love you without it  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
La la la  
La la la  
La la la  
Ah ah  
Oh yeah  
La la la  
La la la  
La la la  
Hey ay  
  
(Fades)  
La la la  
La la la  
La la la  
La la la

I've never gone with the wind, just let it flow  
Let it take me where I want to go  
Till you open the door, there's so much more  
I've never seen it before  
I was trying to fly but I couldn't find wings  
But you came along and you changed everything  
  
[Chorus:]  
You lift my feet off the ground  
You spin me around  
You make me crazier, crazier  
Feels like I'm falling and I am lost in your eyes  
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier  
  
I watched from a distance as you made life your own  
Every sky was your own kind of blue  
And I wanted to know how that would feel  
And you made it so real  
You showed me something that I couldn't see  
You opened my eyes and you made me believe  
  
[Chorus:]  
You lift my feet off the ground  
You spin me around  
You make me crazier, crazier  
Feels like I'm falling and I am lost in your eyes  
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier oh  
  
Baby you showed me what livin' is for  
I don't wanna hide anymore  
  
[Chorus:]  
You lift my feet off the ground  
You spin me around  
You make me crazier, crazier  
Feels like I'm falling and I am lost in your eyes  
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier, crazier, crazier!

Chorus:  
You've taken me under  
You've stolen my thunder  
And I think I'm all out of fire

Oh, 'cause I'll never make it  
If I'm not living on the edge  
And for the rest  
Let's just forget  
'Cause I never want out of this...  
  
Repeat Chorus

Here I am, dancing in the wind  
My back to your face  
I see the ocean apond us, near to my feet  
You've be smiling the whole time, never said a word  
And I said what are you thinking of, makes you smile that way  
  
And you said  
  
You  
Your eyes  
Your smile  
Your face  
I've been taking you in a while  
You  
When I'm around  
You seem to light up my world  
And turn me 'round and 'round  
You  
  
I just wanted to laugh  
Or cry  
That was so beautiful  
What you just said  
But then you turned silent again  
As I lifted up my knife  
You said, before you kill me  
Remember this  
  
And you said  
  
You  
Your eyes  
Your smile  
Your face  
I've been taking you in a while  
You  
  
When I'm around  
You seem to light up my world  
And turn me 'round and 'round  
You  
  
Then I really started to cry  
And I bawled  
And I put down my knife  
And took you inside my house  
And I told you that I love you  
Then we did it  
  
The next day I woke up  
After being up all night  
Screaming  
I look over to you  
And I started to smile  
And then you said  
Why the Hell are you smiling like that for Bitch?  
  
And I said  
  
Your eyes  
Your smile  
Your face  
I've been taking you in a while  
You  
When I'm around  
You seem to light up my world  
And turn me 'round and 'round  
You  
  
Chorous X3  
  
I'm so glad for you

I felt the need  
To tell you  
Something special and true  
But you never listened  
I gave my heart to you  
And now I'm wondering  
What did I ever do to you... and  
  
(Chorus:)  
You turned around  
You turned away  
You turned me down  
Now What can I say  
Do you want to live alone  
Do you want to live depressed  
Why would you break my heart  
All I wanna know is  
What did I ever do to you  
  
How come you did  
That to me  
You broke my heart  
And it was  
Embarrassing  
How it happened  
In front of my friends  
  
(Chorus)  
  
What did I do to you  
Did I ever break your heart  
No no no oh  
  
(Chorus)  
  
And  
What did I ever do to you

I've been  
Runnin'  
In circles all day long  
I'm out  
Of breath  
But I'm still goin' strong  
  
I'm gonna get you yeah  
No matter what they say  
You think I'm losin'  
But I always get my way  
(Hey)  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't walk away when I'm talkin' to you  
This ain't no time for your bad attitude  
Don't give me that face  
When you know I'm really down for the chase  
Cause my heart's already in it  
And I'm never gonna quit it  
When you finally gonna get it  
Don't walk away  
  
(When I'm talkin' to you)  
  
You act  
Act like  
That I don't have a clue  
You think  
You know it all  
But I'm so onto you  
  
You think you've figured out  
Just how to win this game  
I'm on your tracks yeah  
I know every move you make  
(Hey)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I won't give up just like that  
I'm gonna make you mine  
If it takes everything I have  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Don't walk away when I'm talkin' to you)  
When I'm talkin' to you  
(This ain't no time for your bad attitude)  
Yeah  
  
Don't give me that face  
When you know I'm really down for the chase  
Cause my heart's already in it  
And I'm never gonna quit it  
When you finally gonna get it  
Don't walk away

Maybe it's the things I say  
Maybe I should think before I speak  
But I thought that I knew enough  
To know myself and do what's right for me  
  
And these walls I'm building now  
You used to bring 'em down  
And these tears I'm cyin' out  
You used to wipe away  
  
I thought you said it was easy  
Listening to your heart  
I thought you said I'd be okay  
So why am I breakin' apart?  
  
Don't wanna be torn(x5)  
  
Don't make me have to choose between  
What I want and what you think I need  
Cause I'll always be your little girl  
But even little girls have got to dream  
  
Now it all feels like a fight  
You were always on my side  
And the lonely I feel now  
You used to make it go way  
  
I thought you said it was easy  
Listening to your heart  
I thought you said I'd be okay  
So why am I breakin' apart?  
  
Don't wanna be torn (x5)  
  
Why is all this so confusing,  
Complicated and consuming?  
Why does all this make me angry?  
I wanna go back to being happy  
  
The tears I'm cryin now  
You used to wipe away  
And these walls I'm building now  
You used to bring 'em down  
  
I thought you said it was easy (hold for 10 seconds)  
Listening to your heart (listening to your heart)  
I thought you said I'd be okay  
So why am I breaking apart?  
  
Don't wanna be torn! (x10)

Do me a favor  
And tell me what you think about me  
Tell me how you want this to be  
Go out on a limb and just dream  
  
Paint a picture  
Choose your colors extra wise  
Especially what you put on my mind  
Imagine what it be like to touch the sky, yeah, yeah  
  
Whoa oh, your thoughts are gonna pick me up  
Do you know it's good to feel so much  
  
Whoa, you got my head in the clouds  
Whoa, you got me thinking out loud  
The more you dream about me the more I believe  
That nothing's ever out of reach  
So dream, dream, dream  
  
I breathe your visions  
They pull me through the coldest of nights  
They steer me towards that moment in time  
When you show me what it means for you to be mine, yeah  
Whoa, oh you're giving me the will to try  
Do you know that there's happy in these eyes  
  
Whoa, you got my head in the clouds  
Whoa, you got me thinking out loud  
The more you dream about me the more I believe  
That nothing's ever out of reach  
So dream, dream, dream  
  
It's like my birthday  
Every time you look at me  
It's like the best thing  
Every time that you dream, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
Whoa oh, your thoughts are gonna pick me up  
Do you know it's good to feel too much  
  
Whoa, you got my head in the clouds  
Whoa, you got me thinking out loud  
The more you dream about me the more I believe  
That nothing's ever out of reach  
So dream, dream, dream  
  
The more you dream about me the more that I believe  
That nothing's ever out of reach  
So dream, dream, dream,  
Dream

Drive my heart into the night  
You can drop the keys off in the morning (in the morning)  
'Cause I don't wannna leave home, without your love  
Without it  
  
You told me that you wanted this  
I told you it was all yours, if you're done with it  
Then what you say forever for?  
If forevers out the door  
I'll ignore, when you call  
  
Drive my heart into the night  
Yeah  
You can drop the keys off in the morning (in the morning)  
'Cause I don't want to leave home, without your love  
Without it  
  
You told me you were coming back (right back)  
Promised it was real and I believed that  
But if I fall for it again, I will be a fool  
If our love is at the end, then why do I still want you yeah  
But I guess I got no valentine  
Send me roses I just let 'em die  
I was crazy thinking you were mine  
It was all just a lie  
  
Drive my heart into the night  
You can drop the keys off in the morning  
'Cause I don't want to leave home, (leave home) without your love  
Without it  
  
I always knew I never wanted this  
I never thought it could happen (it could happen)  
You acted like you wanted this  
But then you led me on (led me on)  
  
I thought you would be there when I go (I go)  
You promised you would be there when I go (I go)  
But all the broken promises I won't miss, I'm finished  
All I know are the facts  
That when I look you in the eyes all I see are the lies  
Been there, done that  
  
Drive my heart into the night  
You can drop the keys off in the morning (In the morning)  
'Cause I don't want to leave home, without your love  
Without it hey hey, uh

After twelve  
Not so well  
Won't pretend  
It's too soon to tell  
What's 'round  
This bend  
No disgrace  
About face  
Any thing  
Not to have to chase  
You down again  
  
You know  
Nothing hurts  
Like losing  
When ya know  
It's really gone  
Except for the pain  
Of choosing  
To hold too long  
  
I tried it your way  
But I got  
Nothing to show  
It's been  
The same, same  
And the story's  
Getting old  
I guess the driveway  
Will be  
The end of the road  
For us it's too late  
And the credits  
Start to roll  
  
A lot to say  
But not today  
Let the radio  
Break the silence  
As we drive  
A kiss goodbye  
Not this time  
Don't remember  
What about this song  
I ever liked  
  
Ya know  
Nothing hurts  
Like losing  
When ya know  
I'm already gone  
Except for the pain  
Of choosing  
To hold too long  
  
I tried it your way  
But I got  
Nothing to show  
It's been  
The same, same  
And the story's  
Getting old  
I guess the driveway  
Will be the end  
Of the road  
For us it's too late  
And the credits  
Start to roll  
  
I thought maybe we were getting somewhere  
But we're still nowhere at all  
I watched your tail  
Lights fading  
I try but the tears won't fall  
I remember  
What it feels like  
To know love  
And have it taken away  
I can't think of what  
I've learned right now  
But I'll be thanking  
You someday  
  
I tried it your way  
But I got  
Nothing to show  
It's been  
The same, same  
And the story's  
Getting old  
I guess the driveway  
Will be  
The end of the road  
For us it's too late  
And the credits  
Start to roll  
  
Roooooooooool  
Credits start to roll  
(Oooh)  
  
I guess the driveway  
End of the road  
(End of the road)  
  
Woo (woo)  
Woo (woo)

My problem isn't that I miss you  
'Cause I don't  
My problem isn't that I kissed you  
Whoa oh  
  
I figured out  
That you're nothin' that I thought you're about  
You're just caught in a place  
It's what time will erase in my heart  
  
You're my type of guy I guess  
If I was stuck in East Northumberland High  
For the rest of my life  
But people change, thank God I did  
  
Just because I liked you back then  
It doesn't mean I like you now  
Just because I liked you back then  
It doesn't mean I like you  
  
Your problem's not for lack of tryin'  
'Cause you do  
It's just that you're at your best when you're lyin'  
Whoa oh  
  
Now you're standing here  
And saying things you think I wanted to hear  
But you got it all wrong  
I've already moved on, my dear  
  
You're my type of guy I guess  
If I was stuck in East Northumberland High  
For the rest of my life  
But people change, thank God I did  
  
Just because I liked you back then  
It doesn't mean I like you now  
Just because I liked you back then  
It doesn't mean I like you  
  
When you're standing near me  
I don't see so clearly  
The feelings are still palpable  
But when I take two steps away  
It sheds some light on my day  
  
Yeah you can't go back  
It's all in the past  
Guess you gotta laugh at it  
  
You're my type of guy I guess  
If I was stuck in East Northumberland High  
For the rest of my life  
But people change, thank God I did  
  
And if there's some confusion  
Let me tell ya, you're just delusional  
Get a clue, 'cause people change  
Thank God I did  
Thank God I did  
Thank God I did  
  
Just because I liked you back then  
It doesn't mean I like you now  
Just because I liked you back then  
It doesn't mean I like you  
It doesn't mean I like you  
  
Just because I liked you back then  
It doesn't mean I like you now  
  
Rock and roll, rock it

Everday,  
Something happens to me.  
And you'll see,  
I'm on my way  
  
I want to be changed.  
I want to be rearranged yeah.  
Open a door,  
In my life that's such a bore.  
  
Full of life,  
Full of dreams.  
That's what I want to be.  
A new chapter in my book,  
Gonna write my own story.  
  
I want to be changed,  
I want to be rearranged yeah.  
Open a door,  
In my life that's such a bore!

Ooooh-ooh...  
  
I feel like I'm a million miles away from myself  
More and more these days  
I've been down so many open roads  
But they never lead me home  
And now I just don't know  
  
Who I really am  
How it's gonna be  
Is there something that I can't see?  
I wanna understand  
  
[Chorus:]  
Maybe I will never be  
Who I was before  
Maybe I don't even know her anymore  
Maybe who I am today  
Ain't so far from yesterday  
Can I find a way to be  
Every part of me?  
  
So I'll try, try to sort things down  
And find myself get my feet back on the ground  
It'll take time but I know I'll be alright  
Cause nothing much has changed...  
On the inside  
  
It's hard to figure out  
How it's gonna be  
Cause I don't really know...  
I wanna understand  
  
[Chorus:]  
Maybe I will never be who I was before  
Maybe I don't even know her anymore  
Maybe who I am today  
Ain't so far from yesterday  
Can I find a wa to be  
Every part of me, yeah?  
  
[Bridge:]  
I don't wanna wait too long  
To find out where I'm meant to belong  
I've always wanted to be where I am today  
But I never thought I'd feel this way  
  
[Chorus:]  
Maybe I will never be who I was before  
Maybe I don't even know her anymore  
Maybe who I am today  
Ain't so far from yesterday  
Can I find a way to be  
Every part of me?  
  
Every part of me.

We both lie silent, still  
In the dead of the night  
Although we both lie close together  
We feel miles apart inside  
  
Was it something I said or something I did  
Did my words not come out right  
Though I tried not to hurt you  
Though I tried  
But I guess that's why they say  
  
[Chorus]  
Every rose has it's thorn  
Just like every night has it's dawn  
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song  
Every rose has it's thorn  
Yeah it does  
  
I listen to our favorite song  
Playing on the radio  
Hear the DJ say loves a game of easy come and easy go  
But I wonder does he know  
Has he ever felt like this  
And I know that you'd be here right now  
If I could let you know somehow  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Though it's been a while now  
I can still feel so much pain  
Like a knife that cuts you, the wound heals  
But the scar, that scar will remain  
  
Every rose, every rose  
Every rose, has its thorn  
  
I know I could saved a love that night  
If I'd known what to say  
Instead of makin' love  
We both made our separate ways  
  
And now I hear you found somebody new  
And that I never meant that much to you  
And to hear that tears me up inside  
And to see you cuts me like a knife  
  
[Chorus]

[Verse 1]  
Evil is but a shadow  
That always accompanies the good  
You can try to have a world  
A world without the shadow  
But it'll be a dark, dark and cold place world  
Cause it would be a world, a world without light too  
Oh, ohh, oh  
  
[Verse 2]  
The lights of nature  
The light of the true  
The light of silence  
The light of all I do  
The brigter it shines from the mountain  
The more evil hides in its hole  
Enjoy soo hard to defeat us  
A world starting to lose your control  
Oh, ohh, oh  
Trol, lose your control  
Trol, lose your control  
Trol, lose your control  
Trol, lose your control  
  
[Bridge]  
We won't stop  
We'll let it go, it drop  
How'd it get to be so obvious?  
I'll have fun  
We won't stop  
We'll let it fucking drop  
We won't stop, oh  
I'll have fun  
  
[Outro]  
Evil is but a shadow  
A shadow in this world  
Evil is but a shadow  
A shadow in this world  
Evil is but a shadow  
A shadow in this world

You don't understand what it is  
That makes me tick  
But you wish you did  
You always second guess, wonderin  
I say yes but you just lose out every time  
  
If you only knew what I talked about  
When I'm with my friends just hangin out  
Then you'd have the inside scoop  
On what to say, what to do  
That way when you play the game  
Baby you can never lose  
  
(Chorus:)  
Don't you wish that you could be a fly on the wall  
A creepy little sneaky little fly on the wall  
All my precious secrets, yeah  
You'd know them all  
Don't you wish that you could be a fly on the wall  
  
You'd love to know, the things I do  
When I'm with my friends, and not with you  
You always second guess, wonderin  
There's other guys I'm flirting with  
You should know by now  
  
If you were my boyfriend, I'd be true to you  
If I make a promise, I'm comin thru  
Don't you wish that you could  
See me every second of the day  
That way you would have no doubt  
But baby, i would never stray  
  
(Chorus:)  
Don't you wish that you could be a fly on the wall  
A creepy little sneaky little fly on the wall  
All my precious secrets, yeah  
You'd know them all  
Don't you wish that you could be a fly on the wall  
  
A little communication  
That'll go all the way  
You're getting misinformation  
Too much hearsay, hearsay  
  
And what I say is  
Come a little closer  
And what I'm gonna say is  
  
Don't You  
Don't You  
Don't You  
Don't you wish you were a?  
Hey!  
  
(Chorus:)  
Don't you wish that you could be a fly on the wall  
A creepy little sneaky little fly on the wall  
All my precious secrets, yeah  
You'd know them all  
Don't you wish that you could be a fly on the wall

Imagining you're far away  
Searching for the words to say  
I feel it when you fall apart  
Our lives are our greatest art  
I don't want to change your mind  
'Cause I accept you  
For everything you are and will be  
Stay here with me now  
  
The only thing that our hearts are made of  
Are the acts of forgiveness and love  
The only thing real when push comes to shove  
Are the acts of forgiveness and love  
'Cause in the end  
No one loses or wins  
The story begins again and again  
With forgiveness and love  
  
You don't ever have to read my mind  
You can see it when you close your eyes  
Don't believe it when you lose your faith  
Another moment is a moment away  
I can't tell you what the future holds  
Or how to live  
All I know is  
What feels right lights up my life again and again  
  
The only thing that our hearts are made of  
Are the acts of forgiveness and love  
The only thing real when push comes to shove  
Are the acts of forgiveness and love  
'Cause in the end  
No one loses or wins  
The story begins again and again  
With forgiveness and love  
  
Let's jump the sun  
Let's find forever  
Where does the time go  
Just live your life  
You'll get another today today today  
Forgiveness and love  
'Cause in the end no one loses or wins  
The story begins again and again  
With forgiveness and love  
  
Let's jump the sun  
Let's jump the sun  
Let's jump the sun  
Forgiveness and love

I feel a surge coming over me  
I feel it all around my thighs  
And chills going up my legs  
This is the worst coming out of me  
When I can't tell, felt like I could die yeah  
And it sends chills up my spine  
  
Your're sexy sexy  
I got things I want to do to you  
Make me make me  
Make my tongue just go do-do-do  
Flex it, flex it  
Flex your muscles, and through the roof  
Arrest it rest it  
'Cause you're a criminal  
  
I been laying in this bed all night long  
Don't you think it's time to get it on  
But we gotta get it right, we can't get it wrong  
Don't you want to feel this fire before it's gone yeah yeah  
  
I feel the thirst pouring out of me  
For things that I wanna try  
That echoes in my head  
This is the first time I get to see  
Things I've never seen in my life yeah  
You make flowers grow under my bed yay  
  
Your're sexy sexy

Do you feel me?  
Oh

I just oh  
Sometimes you just wanna  
  
Uh be naughty  
  
I feel so alone when you were gone  
Feeling right back home when I'm in your arms  
You played my strings like my guitar  
When I look in your eyes I see all the stars  
  
Would you believe  
I'm dancing in the mirror (dancing in the mirror)  
I feel like I got no panties on  
I wish that I could feel ya (wish I could feel ya)  
So hurry, hang up that damn phone

Don't you think it's time to get it on  
But we gotta get it right, we can't get it wrong  
Don't you want to feel this fire before it's gone yeah yeah  
  
On and on, and make it last forever

Just as long as it's you and I together  
Babe don't make me wait yeah  
  
Don't make me wait yeah  
Don't make me wait

I come home in the morning light  
My mother says "when you gonna live your life right?"  
Oh mother dear we're not the fortunate ones  
And girls they wanna have fun  
Oh girls just wanna have fun  
  
The phone rings in the middle of the night  
My father yells what you gonna do with your life  
Oh daddy dear you know you're still number one  
But girls they wanna have fun  
Oh girls just wanna have  
  
[Chorus]  
That's all they really want  
Some fun  
When the working day is done  
Girls they wanna have fun  
Oh girls just wanna have fun  
  
Some boys take a beautiful girl  
And hide her away from the rest of the world  
I want to be the one to walk in the sun  
Oh girls they wanna have fun  
Oh girls just wanna have  
  
That's all they really want  
Some fun  
When the working day is done  
Girls--they want to have fun  
Oh girls just want to have fun,  
They wanna have fun,  
They wanna have fun  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh oh oh  
Girls girls girls  
Wanna have fun fun fun fun yeah  
Girls just have fun

What...  
Could you hope to achieve,  
When I'm cryin' and you know why?  
How...  
Do you find your reasons,  
In my deepest, darkest night?  
I keep givin' you up.  
  
I remember when,  
You were my only friend.  
Now I'm not sure you can,  
Feel like that again.  
I keep givin' you up.  
  
And my,  
You know my mind's made up,  
This time.  
There's no goin' back to find  
What we had.  
And I know,  
There's no light left to shine.  
There's no wrong,  
But there's no right.  
So enough.  
I'm givin' you up.  
  
All the things that you said,  
Well you seem to forget.  
They surround in my head,  
Every night.  
And there's a battle within,  
That I'll never win.  
'Cause it's me,  
That I'm up against.  
'Cause it's my heart,  
Versus common sense.  
Can I give you up?  
  
And my,  
You know my mind's made up,  
This time.  
There's no goin' back to find,  
What we had.  
And I know,  
There's no light left to shine.  
There's no wrong,  
But there's no right.  
So enough.  
I'm givin' you up.  
  
Strip the layers,  
Make me better,  
Help me get out clean,  
Show your colors.  
I'm slipping under.  
Help me through this,  
Pleaseee!  
  
And my,  
You know my mind's made up,  
This time.  
There's no goin' back to find,  
What we had.  
And I know,  
There's no light left to shine.  
There's no wrong,  
But there's no right.  
So enough.  
I'm givin' you up.  
  
Yeahhhhh!  
My mind's made up!  
Yeahhhhhh  
I'm giving you up,  
I'm giving you up,  
I'm giving you up.

All you overloaded, candy coated?  
Your life's imploding now  
There's a risk worth taking, a pain worth aching  
On this hollow ground  
  
We can let go  
Don't hold on to all of life's hardest parts  
When we think of stopping, let's keep on rocking  
To the rhythm of our hearts  
  
We can, we can break out of here  
Jump on over there where the air is clearer  
We can, we can forget the pace  
Win in our own race, become a broken chain, yeah  
We are broken chains, yeah, good and broken  
  
Find the magic, go and grab it  
Your fate is in your hands  
Come on, find a reason to believe  
And just tell yourself, "We can!"  
  
We can, we can break out of here  
Jump on over there where the air is clearer  
We can, we can forget the pace  
Win in our own race, become a broken chain, yeah  
We are broken chains, yeah, good and broken  
  
Get off your seat, on your feet  
Raise your hands, feel the beat  
Let it go, lose control  
Feel it in your soul  
  
Don't you know what you can do  
If you have faith in you  
Let's not be invisible  
There's no red light in life, just go!  
  
We can, we can break out of here  
Jump on over there where the air is clearer  
We can, we can forget the pace  
Win in our own race, become a broken chain, yeah  
We are broken chains, yeah, good and broken  
We can, we can, yeah!  
  
Oh we can, oh we can, oh we can, oh we can  
Oh we can  
Oh we can, oh we can, oh we can, oh we can  
Oh we can  
Oh we can, oh we can, oh we can, oh we can  
Oh we can  
Good and broken

Yeah, the rumors are true  
I deleted my Twitter  
Ha, can you believe it?  
I got 2, 2 million  
Then I said adios  
I had to say goodbye  
And this little rap is to tell my fans why  
Huh, uh!  
  
No, it wasn't because my friend told me to  
Y'all know very well, what you say I don't do  
And the reasons are simple  
I started tweetin' bout pimples  
I stopped livin' for moments  
And started livin' for people  
  
Yeah, you right what'cha doin'  
But who really cares  
If I'm playin' with Noah or just doin' my hair?  
Everything that I type  
And everything that I do  
All those lame gossip sites  
Take it and they make it news  
I want my private life private  
I'm done trying to please  
I ain't livin' for tabliods  
No, I'm livin' for me  
No more emo quotes  
And fake feuds with Demi  
Yeah, I'm done with all that  
And the truth is I'm too busy  
  
Yeah, I gotta admit  
I miss Dane Cook's tweets  
And I really liked looking at Katy Perry and Britney  
I might have some withdraws  
I was a little obsessed  
But I'm peacin' out  
And I'm leaving with this  
Ha, goodbye  
Ah, ah goodbye  
Freaky-freaky-freak-auuwww

Smooth-talking  
So rocking  
He's got everything that a girl's wantin  
Guitar cutie  
Who plays it groovy  
And I can't keep myself from doing something stupid  
  
Think I may be falling for his smile  
Get butterflies when he says my name  
  
He's got something special  
He's got something special  
The way that he's lookin at me, I want to get all sentimental  
He's got something special  
He's got something special  
I can hardly breathe, something's telling me, telling me maybe he could be the
one  
He could be the one  
He could be the one  
He could be the one... Repeat  
  
He's lightning  
Sparks are flying  
Everywhere I go he's always on my mind and  
I'm goin' crazy  
About him lately  
And I can't help myself from how my heart is racing  
  
Think I'm really digging on his vibe  
He really blows me away!  
  
Woooo!  
  
He's got something special  
He's got something special  
And when he's looking at me, I want to get all sentimental  
He's got something special  
He's got something special  
I can hardly breathe, something's been telling me, telling me maybe he could
be the one  
He could be the one  
He could be the one  
He could be the one... Repeat  
  
And he's got a way of making me feel  
Like everything I do is  
Perfectly fine  
The stars are aligned when I'm with him  
And I'm so into him...  
  
He's got something special  
He's got something special  
And when he's looking at me, I want to get all sentimental  
He's got something special  
He's got something special  
I can hardly breathe, something's been telling me, telling me maybe he could
be the one  
He could be the one  
He could be the one  
He could be the one... Repeat

Sometimes I wonder if everything changed,  
How could we make out?  
And now suddenly thunder and everything's changed,  
There's this big dark cloud  
Hovering  
  
Hovering, hovering, hovering  
You always said that we'd make it through  
Troubling, stumbling, fumbling  
For the words to say that I'm leaving you  
I'm leaving you  
  
We go through the motions like everything's settled,  
But it's inside out  
And it makes us uncomfortable still holding on  
When there's all this doubt  
Hovering  
  
Hovering, hovering, hovering  
You always said that we'd make it through  
Troubling, stumbling, fumbling  
For the words to say that I'm leaving you  
I'm leaving you  
  
And maybe we're just older,  
Just a little older  
'cause the fact that this is over.  
The fact that this is over with you's been  
  
Hovering, stumbling, fumbling.  
For the words to say that I'm leaving you  
I'm leaving you  
  
You always said we'd make it through,  
You always said we'd make it through

We haven't met, and that's okay  
'Cause you will be asking for me one day  
  
Don't want to wait in line  
The moment is mine believe me  
  
Don't close your eyes  
'Cause it's a chance worth takin'  
And I think that I can shake it  
  
I know where I stand  
I know who I am  
I would never run away when life gets bad  
It's everything I see  
Every part of me  
Gonna get what I deserve  
I got nerve  
  
Electrified, I'm on a wire  
Gettin' together and we're on fire  
What I said, you heard  
Now I've got you spinning  
  
Don't close your mind  
The words I use are open  
And I think that I can show you  
  
I know where I stand  
I know who I am  
I would never run away when life gets bad  
It's everything I see  
Every part of me  
I know I can change the world, yeah, yeah, yeah  
I know what you like  
I know what you think  
Not afraid to stare you down until you blink  
It's everything I see  
Every part of me  
Gonna get what I deserve  
I got nerve  
  
You... You need to discover  
Who you can make you feel free  
And I, I need to uncover  
The part of you that's reaching out for me, hey  
  
I know where I stand  
I know who I am  
I would never run away when life gets bad  
It's everything I see  
Every part of me  
I know I can change the world, yeah, yeah, yeah  
I know what you like  
I know what you think  
Not afraid to stare you down until you blink

Not afraid to stare you down until you blink  
It's everything I see  
Every part of me  
Gonna get what I deserve  
(I got)  
I got nerve  
  
You, you need to discover  
You make me feel free  
And I, I need to uncover  
The part of you that's reaching out for me  
  
I know where I stand  
I know who I am  
I would never run away when life gets bad  
  
It's everything I see  
Every part of me

Not afraid to stare you down until you blink  
It's  
Everything you see  
Every part of me  
Gonna get what I deserve  
I got nerve  
(Repeat)

These clouds aren't going nowhere baby,  
Rain keeps coming down  
I just thought I'd try to call you baby,  
'for you got too far out of town  
And I hope that you get this message  
That I'm leaving for you  
Cause I hate that you left without hearing  
The words that I needed you to  
  
And hope you find it,  
What you're looking for  
And I hope it's everything you dreamed your life could be,  
And so much more  
And I hope you're happy  
Wherever you are  
I wanted you to know that  
And nothing's gonna change that  
And I hope you find it  
  
Am I supposed to hang around and wait forever,  
Last words that I said  
But that was nothing but a broken heart talking, baby  
You know that wasn't what I meant  
Call me up, let me know that you got this message  
That I'm leaving for you  
Cause I hate that you left without hearing  
The words that I needed you to  
  
And I hope you find it,  
What you're looking for  
And I hope it's everything you dreamed your life could be,  
And so much more  
And I hope you're happy  
Wherever you are  
I wanted you to know that  
And nothing's gonna change that  
And I hope you find it  
  
Whatever it is out there,  
That you miss it here  
  
And I hope you find it,  
What you're looking for  
And I hope it's everything you dreamed your life could be,  
And so much more  
And I hope you're happy  
Wherever you are  
I wanted you to know that  
And nothing's gonna change that  
  
No no no  
And, I hope you find it  
I hope you find it!

[Miley]  
Ooh  
Yeah  
I didn't wanna listen to what you were sayin'  
I thought that I knew all I need to know  
I didn't realize that somewhere inside me  
I knew you were right but I couldn't say so  
  
I can take care of myself, yeah, you taught me well  
  
[Chorus: (Miley)]  
I learned from you that I do not crumble  
I learned that strength is something you choose  
All of the reasons to keep on believin'  
There's no question, that's a lesson, that I learned from you  
  
[Billy Ray]  
We always don't agree on  
What is the best way  
To get to the place that we're going from here  
But I can really trust you, and give you the distance  
to make your decisions without any fear  
  
[Both]  
I'm grateful for all of the times  
You opened my eyes  
  
[Chorus: (Both)]  
I learned from you that I do not crumble  
I learned that strength is something you choose  
All of the reasons to keep on believin'  
There's no question, that's a lesson  
I learned from you  
  
[Both]  
You taught me to stand on my own  
  
[Miley] and I thank you for that  
  
[Both]  
You saved me, you made me,  
and now that I'm looking back  
  
[Miley] I can say  
  
[Both] woooaaahhhh!  
  
[Miley] Hmmmm... Hmmmm... Yeah!  
  
[Both]  
I learned from you that  
  
[Miley] I learned from you  
  
[Both]  
I do not crumble  
I learned that strength is something you choose  
  
[Miley] something you choose  
  
[Both]  
All of the reasons to keep on believin',  
  
[Miley] keep on believin'  
  
There's no question, that's a lesson that I learned from you  
  
[Miley]  
Woooaaahhhh!  
I learned from yoooouuu  
  
I learned that strength is something you choose  
[Billy Ray] something you choose  
  
[Both]  
All of the reasons to keep on believin',  
There's no question, that's a lesson that I learned from you  
  
[Miley] yeah!  
  
[Both]  
I learned from you

Miley:  
Nobody listens to me,  
Don't hear a single thing I say,  
Say anythings to me,  
Anything to get you on my head.  
Don't know how I really feel,  
Cause it's the faith  
That makes it like that I don't care  
Don't know how much it hurts  
To turn around like you were never there  
Like somehow you could be replaced  
And I could walk away  
From the promises we made  
And swore we'd never break  
  
(Miley e Travolta)  
Chorus:  
I thought I lost you  
When you ran away  
To try to find me  
I thought I'd never  
Your sweet face again  
I turned around  
And you were gone  
And on and on  
The days went  
I kept the moments  
That we were in  
And I knew in my heart  
That you  
Would come back for me  
My friend  
And now I got you  
When I thought  
I lost you!  
  
Bridge travolta  
I told myself  
I wouldn't sleep  
Till  
I searched the world  
From sea to sea  
  
Miley  
I made a wish upon a star  
I turned around  
And there you were,  
  
Together:  
And now here we are  
  
Miley: Here we are  
I thought I lost you  
  
Travolta:  
I thought I lost You!  
  
Miley: you  
  
Together: Yeh I thought I lost you

Uh oh, there you go again talking cinematic  
Yeah you! You're charming, got everybody star struck  
I know how you always seem to go  
For the obvious instead of me but get a ticket and you'll see  
  
If we were a movie, you'd be the right guy  
And I'd be the best friend that you fall in love with  
In the end we'd be laughing, watching the sunset  
Fade to black, show the names, play the happy song, yeah  
  
Yeah, yeah when you call me I can hear it in your voice  
Oh sure! Wanna see me and tell me all about her  
La la, I'll be acting through my tears  
Guess you'll never know that I should win an Oscar for the scene I'm in  
  
If we were a movie you'd be the right guy  
And I'd be the best friend that you fall in love with  
In the end we'd be laughing, watching the sunset  
Fade to black, show the names, play the happy song  
  
Wish I could tell you there's a twist, some kind of hero in disguise  
And we're together, it's for real, now playing  
Wish I could tell you there's a kiss like something more than in my mind  
I see it could be amazing  
(Could be amazing!)  
  
If we were a movie, you'd be the right guy  
And I'd be the best friend that you fall in love with  
In the end we'd be laughing, watching the sunset  
Fade to black, show the names, play the happy song  
  
If we were a movie, you'd be the right guy  
And I'd be the best friend that you fall in love with  
In the end we'd be laughing, watching the sunset  
Fade to black, show the names, play the happy song  
  
If we were a movie, you'd be the right guy  
And I'd be the best friend that you fall in love with  
In the end we'd be laughing, watching the sunset  
Fade to black, show the names, play the happy song

Verse 1:  
I want a smile on my face.  
A happy alert to my brain.

I want a wonderful life.  
I want to avoid the rush.  
I don't even wanna hide.  
  
Chorus:

As I can.

Yes I am.  
  
Verse 2:  
I want a rainbow above me.  
And feel inside so free.

I want everything so clear.  
  
Chorus x1.  
  
Bridge:

Don't call me  
Leave me alone

I'm out to have a good time  
To get you off of my mind  
Cuz I don't  
And I won't need you (woot! Woot!)  
  
Send out a 911

And play out without you  
You better hold tight  
This girl's night is without you  
Let's go  
G. N. O.

You'll hear from everyone  
You'll get the 411  
Hey boy  
You knew this day would come  
  
[Chorus:]

And it's time for me to draw the line  
  
[Chorus:]  
Cuz it's a girl's night  
It's alright without you

Don't wanna be treated differently  
I wanna keep it all inside

Oh, Karen  
You take it all too hard  
You been talking to those fools again  
And they'll tear your world apart  
Oh, Karen  
You gotta try to understand  
Gotta hold on to your soul  
Cause they'll crush it if they can  
  
[Chorus]  
So, Karen don't be sad  
They're just a bunch of fools  
And you can make them powerless

Oh, Karen  
You know you're only letting 'em win  
By letting all their lies and hate

But you can give it back to us  
Just fake it for a while  
  
[Chorus]  
So, Karen don't be sad  
They're just a bunch of fools  
And you can make them powerless

Life is like an unpaved road  
It's just keeps on spinnin' with it's bumps and turns  
Ups and downs it's jumpin around!  
You go through all hard times  
You think you might not get through  
Do I take a Right  
Or do I take a Left  
Life just seems to ramble on no matter the situation  
Life has it's ups and downs  
Sometimes you just need to get away  
  
I know I've had my trouble  
Making my desicions  
Sometimes they aren't so great  
I seeem to make it through these  
But times are gettin' harder and harder  
  
You need a lot of parental support  
They know the road and the ways of life  
And can help you make it through the day  
  
After a while you'll get used to the road  
And the way that is going to be  
I promise you'll get used to it...  
You'll just have to see  
  
Cause Life's Like a road  
And it must go on  
And it seems like it goes on forever and ever...  
But no day you will have to relize just how fast it stops

[Verse:]  
Don't let no small frustration,  
Ever bring you down (No, no, no, no),  
Just take a situation,  
And turn it all around,  
  
[Pre-Chorus:]  
With a new attitude everything can change,  
Make it how you want it to be,  
Staying mad, why do that, Give yourself a break,  
Laugh about it and you'll see!  
  
[Chorus:]  
Life's what you make it,  
So let's make it rock,  
Life's what you make it,  
So come on, come on, (Everybody Now)!  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Don't be sad, broken-hearted,  
There's so much to do (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)  
Life's is hard, or it's party,  
The choice is up to you!  
  
[Pre-Chorus:]  
With a new attitude everything can change,  
Make it how you want it to be,  
Staying sad, why do that, Give yourself a break,  
I know you wanna party with me  
  
[Chorus:]  
Life's what you make it,  
So let's make it rock,

[Bridge:]  
Things are looking up,  
Anytime you want,  
All you gotta do is realize that,  
It's under your control,  
So let the good times rock and roll!  
  
D-d-d-do it now!  
  
Aaaaaah!

If I can't trust then why am I giving my heart  
In exchange for him to love me  
'Cause there ain't much difference  
In a one night stand then one that ain't for me  
Giving too much cause you hate that you love  
Everything that he do and you can't deny you want him  
So what, light a fire underneath this bitch and blow  
  
Money ain't nothing, money can't buy you love  
I don't give a damn if he's sitting on a crib  
Money ain't nothing, what about the real and the way you build  
Money get low and the DJ stop and the music slow down and the shit gets blurry  
  
Love, money, party

I've been through heartbreaks, heartbreaks  
Much for anybody with a human heart to take  
You know it's something that you care to elaborate  
But I've been left with the live bait  
I done messed with the fire, I met a girl on the side  
I done leave it all on the line  
  
Money ain't nothing, money can't buy you love  
I don't give a damn if he's sitting on a crib  
Money ain't nothing, what about the real and the way you build  
Money get low and the DJ stop and the music slow down and the shit gets blurry  
  
Love, money, party  
Money ain't nothing but money  
When you get to the money, ain't nothing but money  
Love ain't nothing but love, when you learn to love, ain't nothing but love  
Party ain't nothing but a party when you party everyday, ain't nothing but a
party

It's easy to feel like  
You're all alone  
To feel like nobody knows  
The great that you are  
The good that's inside you  
Is trying so hard to break through  
  
Maybe it's your time to lift up and fly  
You won't know if you never try  
I will be there with you all of the way  
You'll be fine  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't let anyone  
Tell you that you're not strong enough  
Don't give up  
There's nothing wrong with just being yourself  
That's more than enough  
Some come on and raise your voice  
Speak your mind and make some noise  
And sing  
Hey, hey  
Make some noise  
Hey, hey, yeah  
  
You want to be known  
You want to be heard  
And know you are beautiful  
You have so much to give  
Some change you wanna live  
So shout it out and let it show  
  
You have a diamond inside of your heart  
A light that shines bright as the stars  
Don't be afraid to be all that you are  
You'll be fine  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't let anyone  
Tell you that you're not strong enough  
Don't give up  
There's nothing wrong with just being yourself  
That's more than enough  
Some come on and raise your voice  
Speak your mind and make some noise  
And sing  
Hey, hey  
Make some noise  
Hey, hey, yeah  
  
[Bridge]  
You can't just sit back and watch the world change  
What matters is what you've got to say  
There's no one else who can stand in your place  
So come on it's never too late  
  
Maybe it's your time to lift up and fly  
You won't know if you never try  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't let anyone  
Tell you that you're not strong enough  
Don't give up  
There's nothing wrong with just being yourself  
That's more than enough  
Some come on and raise your voice  
Speak your mind and make some noise  
And sing  
Hey, hey  
Make some noise  
Hey, hey, yeah  
Hey, hey  
(Make some noise)  
Speak your mind and make some noise  
And sing hey, yeah

Chapter one we started happy  
The second that you said you loved me  
Started questioning us, are we really in love  
Trying to figure out chapter three  
But you're not giving me anything  
If this is what we are, then I gotta move on  
You think this is everything  
But this is no book of us  
  
You might think I'm crazy  
That I'm lost and foolish  
Leaving you behind  
Maybe you're right  
You might think I'm crazy  
That I'm lost and foolish leaving you behind  
Maybe you're right  
Maybe you're right  
  
Here comes the part of you and me  
Arguing about nothing  
You told me it's as good as it gets  
Yeah I'm real emotional  
Blame it on your mental jokes  
How much did you think that I could take  
So much for taking this too far  
You can't blame me for who I am  
It's too late for us to try to be in love right now  
  
You might think I'm crazy (crazy)  
That I'm lost and foolish  
Leaving you behind  
Maybe you're right  
You might think I'm crazy  
That I'm lost and foolish leaving you behind  
Maybe you're right  
Maybe you're right  
  
Felt the pages now, this chapter's done  
Moving on up and forward onto all that will become  
If you ever get to the place where the sun is shining every day  
Then I'll be on your mind  
  
You might think I'm crazy  
That I'm lost and foolish  
Leaving you behind  
Maybe you're right  
You might think I'm crazy  
That I'm lost and foolish leaving you behind  
Maybe you're right  
Maybe you're right

I've been stranded on a lonely street  
Got lost in the shadows  
Fell hard in the battle  
Heard cries and the suffering  
I walked through the darkness  
Left broken and heartless  
  
I'm calling out, can you hear my voice?  
I'm gonna find you through all the noise  
Ooh whoa  
You know there's nothing that I wouldn't do  
Shine your light as I reach for you  
  
My heart beats for love  
My heart beats for love  
It's the sound that I hear, tells me not to give up  
It breathes in my chest and  
It runs through my blood  
My heart beats for love  
My heart beats for love  
  
Whoa ooh oh oh oh yeah  
  
And I've been told at least a thousand times  
It's not worth the struggle, the hurt or the trouble  
I keep running up to these front lights  
No I won't surrender  
I'll wait here forever  
  
Standing here with my flag held high  
Oh can't you see that it's worth the fight?  
My heart beats for love  
My heart beats for love  
It's the sound that I hear, tells me not to give up  
It breathes in my chest and  
It runs through my blood  
My heart beats for love  
My heart beats for love  
  
Whoa ooh oh oh oh yeah  
  
I'm not to cross this battle field  
I'm screaming out, can you hear me now?  
I'm holding on, I stand my ground  
I'm screaming out, can you hear me now?  
  
My heart beats for love  
My heart beats for love  
It's the sound that I hear, tells me not to give up  
It breathes in my chest and  
It runs through my blood  
My heart beats for love  
My heart beats for love  
  
My heart beats for love  
My heart beats for love  
It's the sound that I hear, tells me not to give up  
It breathes in my chest and  
It runs through my blood  
My heart beats for love  
My heart beats for love  
My heart beats for love, love

[Intro]  
Fa lalalala  
  
[Verse 1]  
This is my sad Christmas song  
I've had it stuck in my head all day long  
I wrote it in the car on my ride home  
Cause I knew I'd walk in the door and I'd be alone  
Why'd I even put up that fuckin' tree?  
If there's no one here that's gonna see  
Just how pretty she looks on Christmas Eve  
Cause there's no one here next to me  
  
[Chorus 1]  
This is my sad Christmas song  
So I light another bong  
I turn on the radio  
I binge watch our favorite shows  
This year feels kind of lame  
But the last one was the same  
But the holiday spirit they say  
Is taking off on a plane  
This is my sad Christmas song  
Fa lalalala  
  
[Verse 2]  
I always thought that Santa was kind of cute  
There's something about his beard, big belly, and boots  
I left Santa more than cookies this year  
I thought he might appreciate a few beers  
That's why I'm always on the naughty list  
He said cause when I get drunk, I'm always showing my tits  
He leaned in for a kiss and he got real near  
I had to stop Santa and say "My true love ain't here"  
  
[Chorus 2]  
This is my sad Christmas song  
So I rip another bong  
I never been good at making plans  
Next year, I'm gonna be with my man  
My little sister says I'm the Grinch  
But my mom thinks I'm just a bitch  
Why did you have to go?  
We were under the mistletoe  
This is my sad Christmas song  
Fa lalalala  
Fa lalala  
  
[Bridge]  
Missing you on fuckin' Christmas, why did you have to go?  
Wishing you a Merry Christmas, know I miss you so  
Missing you on fuckin' Christmas, why did you have to go?  
Wishing you a Merry Christmas, know I miss you so  
  
[Outro]  
Wishing you a Merry Christmas  
(Fa lalalala  
Fa lalala)  
Wishing you a Merry Christmas  
(Fa lalalala  
Fa lalala)  
Wishing you a Merry Christmas  
(Fa lalalala  
Fa lalala)  
Wishing you a Merry Christmas

Everybody makes mistakes  
Everybody has those days  
1, 2, 3, 4!  
Everybody makes mistakes  
Everybody has those days  
Everybody knows what, what? I'm talkin? 'bout  
Everybody gets that way  
Everybody makes mistakes  
Everybody has those days  
Everybody knows what, what I'm talkin? 'bout  
Everybody gets that way, yeah!  
Sometimes I'm in a jam  
I've gotta make a plan  
It might be crazy  
I do it anyway  
No way to know for sure  
I figure out a cure  
I'm patchin? up the holes  
But then it overflows  
If I'm not doin' too well  
Why be so hard on myself?  
Nobody's perfect  
I gotta work it  
Again and again  
'Til I get it right  
Nobody's perfect  
You live and you learn it  
And if I mess it up sometimes  
Nobody's perfect  
Sometimes I work a scheme  
But then it flips on me  
Doesn't turn out how I planned  
Gets stuck in quicksand  
But no problem can't be solved  
Once I get involved  
I try to be delicate  
Then crash right into it  
But my intentions are good, yeah yeah yeah  
Sometimes just misunderstood  
Nobody's perfect  
I gotta work it  
Again and again  
'Til I get it right  
Nobody's perfect  
You live and you learn it  
And if I mess it up sometimes  
Nobody's perfect  
I gotta work it  
I know in time I'll find a way  
Nobody's perfect  
Sometimes I fix things up  
And they fall apart again  
Nobody's perfect  
I know I mix things up  
But I always get it right in the end  
You know I do  
Next time you feel like  
It's just one of those days  
When you just can't seem to win  
If things don't turn out the way you planned  
Figure something else out  
Don't stay down, try again, yeah!  
Everybody makes mistakes  
Everybody has those days  
Everybody knows what, what? I'm talkin? 'bout  
Everybody gets that way  
Everybody makes mistakes  
Everybody has those days  
Everybody knows what, what I'm talkin? 'bout  
Everybody gets that way  
Nobody's perfect  
I gotta work it  
Again and again  
'Til I get it right  
Nobody's perfect  
You live and you learn it  
And if I mess it up sometimes  
Nobody's perfect  
I gotta work it  
I know in time I'll find a way  
Nobody's perfect  
You live and you learn it  
'Cause everybody makes mistakes  
Nobody's perfect  
(Nobody's perfect)  
No no  
Nobody's perfect!  

Hey! I ain't looking at you  
For no particular reason  
It doesn't inspire for me to be in  
I gotta open that door  
Hey, I gotta get it open hey  
I'm breaking way through, just like the robber  
And smile for the camera  
Damn, I feel awesome!  
But she doesn't know more  
Gotta get it opened!  
  
You never listen when I need someone to talk to  
So you switch the subject  
Cause, cause it's beyond you  
When you talk about your dreams, I'm never included  
I need to stop sleeping on myself  
Wake up and do it on my own!  
I found a way, yeah  
And I'll do it on my onw, hey!  
I can do anything, yeah  
And I'll do it on my own  
  
Can't you get it done with the help of no one  
I came to this word by myself  
So I don't need nobody else!  
We have just begun,  
So much to do, so young  
Don't be afraid of alone  
You'll get it done on your own!  
Uh, uh, uh!  
  
I know you're in there  
Open up, open up!  
Just like the feds, looking for the stuff  
Three knocks at the door  
I gotta get it open!  
I'm so confused with all the traffic  
I'mma skip the line  
Who cares what happens  
I gotta stay on that course  
I gotta get it open!  
  
You never listen when I need someone to talk to  
So you switch the subject  
Cause, cause it's beyond you  
When you talk about your dreams, I'm never included  
I need to stop sleeping on myself  
Wake up and do it on my own!  
I found a way, yeah  
And I'll do it on my own  
I can do anything, yeah!  
And I'll do it on my own!  
  
Can't you get it done with the help of no one  
I came to this word by myself  
So I don't need nobody else!

(Feat. Billy Ray Cyrus)  
  
There's a song that's inside of my soul  
It's the one that I've tried to write over and over again  
I'm awake and in the infinite cold  
But You sing to me over and over and over again  
  
So I lay my head back down  
And I lift my hands and pray to be only Yours  
I pray to be only Yours  
I know You're my only hope  
  
You sing to me of the song of the stars  
Of Your galaxy dancing and laughing and laughing again  
When it feels like my dreams are so far  
You sing to me of the plans that You have for me over again  
  
And I lay my head back down  
And I lift my hands and pray to be only Yours  
I pray to be only Yours  
I know You're my only hope  
  
I give You my empathy, I'm giving You all of me  
I want Your symphony singing in all that I am  
At the top of my lungs I'm giving it back  
  
And I lay my head back down  
And I lift my hands and pray to be only Yours  
I pray to be only Yours, I pray to be only Yours  
I know You're my only hope

Verse 1]  
How can I love someone I never touched?  
You lived under the water, but I love you so much  
You never been on land, and you never seen the sky  
You don't know what a cloud is  
Why does everything I love have to die?  
They all wanted to see you be as big as you could be  
But I couldn't let that be  
By keeping you small, by keeping you safe  
If I could do it again, I'd release you to sea  
Cause I can't bear to see  
Something so wild just die in a tank  
  
[Chorus 1]  
And Pablow the blowfish  
I miss you so much  
And Pablow the blowfish  
I miss you so bad  
  
[Verse 2]  
On Saturday night, we all went out to eat  
But I can never decide, so someone chose sushi  
I got soup, and I ordered rice  
But watching my friends eat my friends, ruined my appetite  
  
[Chorus 2]  
Oh, Pablow the blowfish  
If they only knew you like I do  
They'd love you too  
And Pablow the blowfish  
I miss you so bad  
  
[Verse 3]  
I won't forget, even one second we had  
Cause you might be gone, but you could never be dead  
I heard of a seahorse named Sadie  
I heard she was quite the lady  
Maybe you'll find her and you could make babies  
That'd be kind of crazy  
  
[Bridge]  
If Pablow the blowfish  
Found love deep in the sea  
Then that would mean  
Pablow the blowfish  
Is better off than here with me  
  
[Outro]  
But Pablow the blowfish  
I miss you so bad

Look at this stuff  
Isn't it neat?  
Wouldn't you think my collection's complete?  
Wouldn't you think I'm the girl  
The girl who has everything?  
  
Look at this trove  
Treasures untold  
How many wonders can one cavern hold?  
Looking around here you think  
Sure, she's got everything  
  
I've got gadgets and gizmos a-plenty  
I've got whozits and whatzits galore  
You want thing-a-ma-bobs?  
I've got twenty!  
But who cares  
No big deal  
I want more  
  
I wanna be where the people are  
I wanna see, wanna see them dancin'  
Walkin' around on those - what do you call 'em?  
Feet!  
  
Flippin' your fins, you don't get too far  
Legs are required for jumpin', dancin'  
Strolling along down a - what's that word again?  
Street!  
  
Up where they walk, up where they run  
Up where they stay all day in the sun  
Wanderin' free, wish I could be  
Part of that world  
  
What would I give if I could live out of these waters?  
What would I pay to spend a day warm on the sand?  
Bet'cha on land they understand  
Bet they don't reprimand their daughters  
Bright young women sick of swimmin'  
Ready to stand  
  
I'm ready to know what the people know  
Ask 'em my questions and get some answers  
What's a fire and why does it - what's the word?  
Burn?  
  
When's it my turn?  
When's it my turn?  
To be  
  
Up where they walk, up where they run  
Up where they stay all day in the sun  
Wanderin' free, wish I could be  
Part of that world  
  
Up where they walk, up where they run  
Up where they stay all day in the sun  
Wanderin' free, wish I could be  
Part of that world

I've been to London been to Paris, Australia and Rome  
There's sexy boys in every city but their not what I want  
Some got money, some got fame, some got cars and the clothes  
But if it just ain't you then I don't wanna know  
  
'Cause baby now I realize that I was wrong  
When I said I didn't need you, so  
Miss you bad, so now I'm coming home  
So you better leave a light on  
Wait for me and just leave the light on  
Ooh  
  
It been like a permanent December  
So much colder then I can remember  
When I get you back, this time I swear that I won't  
Won't ever let you go, won't let you go, go  
Won't let you go, go, go, go,  
Won't let you go, no  
Go, go, go, go, no, no, no, no!  
  
I've been to New York been to L.A and to Baton Rouge  
I met a boy in every city, no one kept me amused  
But don't call me a Lolita cause I don't let them through  
'Cause I'm saving all my loving for someone, and it's you  
  
'Cause baby now I realize that I was wrong  
When I said I didn't need you so  
Miss you bad, so now I'm coming home  
So better leave a light on (a light on)  
Wait for me and just leave the light on  
Ohh  
  
It's been like a permanent December  
So much colder then I can remember  
When I get you back, this time I swear that I won't  
Won't ever let you go, won't let you go, no  
Won't let you go, go, go, go,  
Won't let you go, no  
Go, go, go, go, no, no, no, no  
Won't let you go, go, go, go won't let you go, no  
Go, go, go, go, no, no, no, no  
  
Hey what do you say?  
'Cause I've been all around the world  
And they just ain't the same  
Hey what do you say?  
Without my baby I go crazy and I just gotta scream  
  
Now I realize that I was wrong  
When I said I didn't need you, so  
Miss you bad, so now I'm coming home  
So better leave a light on  
Wait for me and just leave the light on  
Oooh oh  
  
It's been like a permanent December  
So much colder then I can remember  
When I get you back, this time I swear that I won't  
Won't ever let you go, won't let you go, no  
It's been like a permanent December  
So much colder then I can remember  
When I get you back, this time I swear that I won't  
Won't ever let you go, won't let you go, go  
Won't let you go, go, go, go, go won't let you go  
No, go, go, go, go, no no no  
  
Won't let you go, go, go, go  
Won't let you go  
No, go, go, go, go, no, no, no

[Chorus]  
Hey  
Get up  
Get loud  
Start pumpin' up the party now  
It's the same old same old  
  
It's the same old, same grind  
But we don't feel we're wasting time  
Not so bored that we can't find a better way  
My friends, my kind  
No one's gettin' left behind  
If they did, it'd be a crime  
That's why we say  
Let the music start a revolution  
No time to play it safe  
  
[Chorus]  
  
They can't  
We can  
Parents might not understand  
Having fun without a plan  
But that's what we do  
We're all here (Let's go!)  
Gotta make this party grow  
Together we can make it blow  
Right through the roof  
The music's gonna start a revolution  
Too late to play it safe  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We don't have to paint by numbers  
Let our voice come out from under  
Hear it rise  
Feel the thunder  
It's time to lose control  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Pumpin' up the party now  
Party now, party now  
  
[Chorus x 2]

If I asked you question  
Like  
"does this dress make me look fat"  
You'd probably say no  
Trying not to hurt my feelings  
But what hurts the most  
Is you can't tell me  
Something  
Without telling a lie  
  
[Chorus:]  
Oh quit telling lies  
You're making me  
Making me cry  
Oh quit telling lies  
I've had it with your alibis  
There's left to hide  
So please don't lie  
  
Times are getting rocky  
'Cause of all of your lying  
Why  
  
Must you see me like this  
I cry  
And I cry  
And I wonder why  
You'd do this to me  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
And  
Why must you  
Break my heart  
This way  
And look me in the eye  
And tell me  
If you really love me  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Oh ooh oh  
Hey  
  
Quit telling lies

Racers start your engines)  
  
The checkered flag  
Is a waving  
My heart is racing  
Racing for you  
It's too sad  
That you're leaving  
I thought maybe we could  
Be something  
Now I'm chasing you down  
In a fast car  
  
[Chorus:]  
The speed  
The sound  
The wind  
The crowd  
You can't stop my heart  
Oh oh yeah  
Racing through my heart  
Oh oh yeah  
  
You are  
Ah ah  
Racing through my heart  
In a fast car  
  
Don't go too fast  
You'll break my heart  
Then I don't know what to do  
'Cause I'm still in love  
With you  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Oh yeah  
Racing  
Hey la  
Hey la  
Through my heart  
Oh yeah  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
(Fast car)

She's gotta do what she's gotta do  
And I've gotta like it or not  
She's got dreams too big for this town  
And she needs to give 'em a shot  
Whatever they are  
  
Looks like I'm all ready to leave  
And nothing left to pack  
Ain't no room for me in that car  
Even if she asked me to tag along  
God, I gotta be strong  
  
I'm at the startin' line of the rest of my life  
As ready as I've ever been  
Got the hunger and the stars in my eyes  
The prize is mine to win  
  
She's waitin' on my blessings  
Before she hits that open road  
But baby get ready, oh I'm ready, get set, don't go  
  
Looks like things are fallin' in place  
Feels like they're fallin' apart  
I painted this big old smile on my face  
To hide my broken heart  
If only she knew  
  
This is where you don't say  
What you want so bad to say  
This is where I want to  
But I won't get in the way  
Of her and her dreams  
And spreadin' her wings  
  
I'm at the startin' line of the rest of my life  
As ready as I've ever been  
Got the hunger and the stars in my eyes  
The prize is mine to win  
  
She's waitin' on my blessings  
Before she hits that open road  
But baby get ready, get set, don't go  
  
I'm at the startin' line of the rest of my life  
As ready as I've ever been  
Got the hunger and the stars in my eyes  
The prize is mine to win  
  
She's waitin' on my blessings  
Before she hits that open road  
But baby get ready, get set, please don't go  
  
Don't go, don't go now  
Mmm don't go  
I'll be all right, I'll be ok  
[Incomprehensible]  
Thinking of you each and every day  
She's gotta do what she's gotta do

I'll be right here where you need me  
Anytime just keep believin'  
And I'll be right here  
  
If you ever need a friend  
Someone to care and understand  
I'll be right here  
  
All you have to do is call my name  
No matter how close or far away  
Ask me once and I'll come, I'll come runnin'  
  
And when I can't be with you dream me near  
Keep me in your heart and I'll appear  
All you gotta do is turn around  
Close your eyes, look inside  
I'm right here  
  
Isn't it great that you know that  
I'm ready to go wherever you're at  
Anywhere I'll be there  
  
All you have to do is call my name  
No matter how close or far away  
Ask me once and I'll come, I'll come runnin'  
  
And when I can't be with you dream me near  
Keep me in your heart and I'll appear  
All you gotta do is turn around  
Close your eyes, look inside  
I'm right here  
  
Whenever you need me  
There's no need to worry  
You know that I'm gonna be  
Right here!  
  
Ask me once and I'll come, I'll come runnin'  
  
And when I can't be with you dream me near  
Keep me in your heart and I'll appear  
All you gotta do is turn around  
Close your eyes, look inside  
I'm right here, oh yeah yeah, I'm right here

Oh oh oh oh oh oh yeah  
  
Sometimes I walk a little faster  
In the school hallway  
Just to get next to you  
Some days I spend a little extra  
Time in the morning  
Just to impress you  
  
Guess you don't notice  
Guess you don't need this  
Sad you're not seein what you're missin'  
On the outside shyin away  
On the inside dyin to say  
  
I'm unusual  
Not so typical  
Way too smart to be waiting around  
Tai chi practicing  
Snowboard champion  
I could fix the flat on your car  
I might even be a rock star  
I might even be a rock star  
  
Sometimes I wish when the phone rings  
That it would be you  
Saying let's hang out  
Then you confess  
That there's something special between us  
Why don't we find out  
You don't even know me  
Guess you don't need me  
Why you're not seein' what you're missin'  
On the outside shyin' away  
On the inside dyin' to say  
  
I'm unusual  
Not so typical  
Way too smart to be waiting around  
Tai chi practicng  
Snowboard champion  
I could fix the flat on your car  
I might even be a rock star  
  
If you only knew the real me  
I might even be a rock star  
I'm telling you that we are meant to be  
Now wouldn't it be nice if you could see  
That I really am a rock star  
  
I'm unusual  
Not so typical  
Way too smart to be waiting around  
Tai chi practicing  
Snowboard champion  
I could fix the flat on your car  
Rockin' it wherever we are  
  
Cuz I'm really a rock star  
Cuz I'm really a rock star

Rockin' around the Christmas tree  
At the Christmas party hop,  
Mistletoe hung where you can see,  
Every couple tries to stop,  
Rockin' around the Christmas tree,  
Let the Christmas spirit ring,  
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie,  
And we'll do some caroling.  
  
You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear,  
Voices singing, "Let's be jolly,  
Deck the halls with boughs of holly",  
Rockin' around the Christmas tree,  
Have a happy holiday,  
Everyone dancin' merrily,  
In the new old-fashioned way.  
  
Interlude  
  
You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear,  
Voices singing, "Let's be jolly,  
Deck the halls with boughs of holly",  
Rockin' around the Christmas tree,  
Have a happy holiday,  
Everyone dancin' merrily,  
In the new old-fashioned way

I can pretend that I don't see you,  
I can pretend I don't wanna hold you when you're around,  
(When you're around)  
I can say that nothing was right,  
But we know if I looked in your eyes, I'd break down,  
(Yeah, lets break down)  
  
If I could, for just one night, to be with you, to make it right,  
And what we were, and what we are,  
Is hidden, in the scars,  
If I could, take you there,  
I won't let go, this I swear,  
You won't have to wonder what we are,  
Cause you wont have to look to far,  
Its in the scars, its hidden in the scars,  
  
If I told you that I love you,  
But I'm doing alright without you it'd be a lie,  
But I could try,  
I'd run a thousand miles we're leaving,  
You're the only one, I want you to bring me to break down,  
(Yeah let's break down!)  
  
If I could, for just one night, to be with you, to make it right,  
And what we were, and what we are,  
Is hidden, in the scars  
  
If I could, take you there,  
I wont let go, this I swear,  
You won't have to wonder what we are,  
Cause you won't have to look to far,  
It's in the scars, ooh  
  
Yeah I'll tell you all my secrets,  
All the ones I've kept inside,  
And I'll give you all the reasons,  
That you faded from my life,  
I won't let go  
Baby come here close, I won't let you walk away  
And what we were, and what we are,  
Is hidden, in the scars,  
If I could, take you there,  
I won't let go, baby this I swear,  
You won't have to wonder what we are,  
Cause you wont have to look to far,  
It's in the scars, its hidden in the scars, it's hidden in the scars!  
Yeah-yeah-eh-eh-eh-yeah-eh  
  
I can pretend that I don't see you,  
I can pretend I don't wanna hold you when you're around

I got my sights set on you and I'm ready to aim  
I have a heart that will never be tamed  
I knew you were somethin' special when you spoke my name  
Now I can't wait to see you again  
  
I've got a way of knowin' when somethin' is right  
I feel like I must have known you in another life  
'Cause I felt this deep connection when you looked in my eyes  
Now I can't wait to see you again  
  
The last time I freaked out, I just kept lookin' down  
I st-st-stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinkin' 'bout  
Felt like I couldn't breathe, you asked what's wrong with me  
My best friend Lesley said, "Oh she's just being Miley"  
  
The next time we hang out, I will redeem myself  
My heart it can't rest 'til then  
Ooh whoa whoa I, I can't wait to see you again  
  
I got this crazy feelin' deep inside  
When you called and asked to see me tomorrow night  
I'm not a mind reader but I'm readin' the signs  
That you can't wait to see me again  
  
The last time I freaked out, I just kept lookin' down  
I st-st-stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinkin' 'bout  
Felt like I couldn't breathe, you asked what's wrong with me  
My best friend Lesley said, "Oh she's just being Miley"  
  
The next time we hang out, I will redeem myself  
My heart it can't rest 'til then  
Ooh whoa whoa I, I can't wait to see you again!  
  
I got my sights set on you and I'm ready to aim  
  
The last time I freaked out, I just kept lookin' down  
I st-st-stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinkin' 'bout  
Felt like I couldn't breathe, you asked what's wrong with me  
My best friend Lesley said, "Oh she's just being Miley"  
  
The next time we hang out, I will redeem myself  
My heart it can't rest 'til then  
Ooh whoa whoa I, I can't wait to see you again  
Ooh whoa whoa I, I can't wait to see you again

Well I believe in love, but not the kinda screws you up, no!  
  
I believe in time and chance  
Cause I'm not one for making plans  
Well you'll go down in history  
And that's just what it is to me  
I believe in moving on  
When sentimental and love is gone  
  
But if I'm crying over you  
I won't lie even it's hard to do  
When you turn around  
I'll be gone and I mean goodbye  
  
I see you in another life  
I see you in another life  
I don't know where I'm going but when you turn around I'll be gone and that  
Means goodbye  
  
I believe in love but not the kinda breaks you up, no!  
I don't regret the day I felt  
Kiss the life, I wish you well  
  
But if I'm crying over you  
I won't lie even it's hard to do  
When you turn around  
I'll be gone and I mean goodbye  
  
I see you in another life  
I see you in another life  
I don't know where I'm going but when you turn around I'll be gone and I  
Mean goodbye.  
  
Well I know you're full, full of good intentions yeah  
But that don't change a thing cause I'm already out of here  
Oh, oh, oh  
When you turn around I'll be gone and I mean goodbye  
  
I see you in another life  
I see you in another life  
I don't know where I'm going but when you turn around I'll be gone and I  
Mean goodbye  
I see you in another life  
  
I see you in another life  
I see you in another life  
I don't know where I'm going but when you turn around I'll be gone and I  
Mean goodbye  
  
I see you in another life  
I see you in another life  
I don't know where I'm going but when you turn around I'll be gone and I  
Mean goodbye

Wake up here I go  
Cram it all down my throat  
Stomach so full that I wish I could choke  
  
Seven a.m. my heads already in a spin  
As soon as I'm out the door  
Bam it hits me like a ton of those red bricks  
Can't dig myself out of this highest ditch  
This madness  
  
I swear sometimes I can't tell  
Which way is up  
Which way is down  
It's all up in my face  
I need to push it away  
Somebody push it away  
So all I can hear  
Is a simple song  
Sing along now  
La la la la la  
La la la la  
La la la la la  
La la la la  
  
Mid day sun beating on the concrete  
Burning up my feet  
To many cars in the street  
The noise  
The red  
The green  
It makes me wanna scream  
  
Five o'clock knocks  
Bumper on bumper on bumper  
Horns honking  
Nobody's looking  
But everyone's talking  
It's another day  
On this highway  
  
I swear sometimes I can't tell  
Which way is up  
Which way is down  
It's all up in my face  
I need to push it away  
Somebody push it away  
Cause all I wanna here  
Is a simple song  
Sing along now  
La la la la la  
La la la la  
La la la la la  
La la la la  
  
Hey!  
  
Sing along now  
Sing along  
  
What I'd give  
To turn it off  
And make it stop  
Make it stop  
Gotta make it stop  
So all that I can here  
Is a simple song oh  
  
Sing along now  
La la la la la  
La la la la  
La la la la la  
La la la la  
La la la la la  
La la la la  
La la la la la  
La da da da

[Intro]  
I'm 'bout to get fucked up, wanna get fucked up?  
Fucked up  
I'm 'bout to get fucked up, wanna get fucked up?  
Fucked up  
I'm 'bout to get fucked up, wanna get fucked up?  
Fucked up  
I'm 'bout to get fucked up, wanna get fucked up?  
Fucked up  
  
[Verse 1]  
The only laws I obey, the ones I'm makin' for myself  
So why you make me play on the road to something else?  
Self control is not something I'm working on  
We fuck, you turn me on, is all I can say about you  
  
[Chorus]  
I feel like a slab of butter that is melting in the Sun  
Aggression melts away now that you and me are one  
Now that you and me are one  
Now that you and me are one  
You turn me on  
You turn me on  
You turn me on  
You turn me on  
  
[Verse 2]  
Make sure made a hole and now it's open full of sweat  
Like a scorpionon fire, stinging myself to death  
I get extinguished, but it's instinctual  
You turn me on, is all I can say about you  
  
[Chorus]  
I feel like a slab of butter that is melting in the Sun  
Aggression melts away now that you and me are one  
I feel like a slab of butter that is melting in the Sun  
Aggression melts away now that you and me are one  
Now that you and me are one  
Now that you and me are one  
You turn me on  
You turn me on  
You turn me on  
You turn me on

[Verse:]  
All the way in the back, with a tree on my lap  
All the boys like to ask me, what you doing with that  
If you say you love me, I ain't fooling with that  
They ask me how I keep a man, I keep a battery pack  
One day he wants me, one day he wants me not  
I don't do chances, cause time isn't what I got  
If he's like that, I got a world tour that they need me at  
I can't be sitting round here waiting for a man to tell me where the fuck my
cv at  
Where Mike Will at  
  
[Chorus:]  
I can strut that strut, that strut, that stuff, bangerz bangerz  
I can strut that strut, that strut, that stuff  
I can strut in my stuff, bangerz  
I can strut that strut, that strut, that stuff  
I can strut that strut, that strut, that stuff  
Fucking bangerz  
I can strut in my stuff bangerz bangerz  
  
[Verse 2: Britney Spears]  
I'm flying high upon the bird, acrophobia  
My slick carder, I ain't down my purse where the dollars at  
I let them know the rings two on the first  
They can call the hearse cause if there's anybody violation I go off with that  
Catwalk, slick talk, flirting with the big dog  
All I need is milli's when I got Billy on my speed dial  
You know I'm that meow, quick to scratch your eyes out  
Strutting on the corner, make them nervous, call it too much  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Bridge:]  
Play boss the play  
Doctor get that big ross  
Sit that on my hand  
Make that video big talk  
Play boss the play  
Strike that boss with the purple  
Got up in my brain  
Had me a little bit dismal  
  
[Outro:]  
I, I bangerz, I, I fucking bangerz I, I bangerz fucking bangerz

Do you wanna know why I'm here tonight  
Well I'll tell you  
  
(Beatboxing)  
Rapping: Everyone knows me as a superstar, but this is how I lived my life
before  
First I was Destiny Hope but I really smile a lot  
  
So I got the name Smiley then I shortened it to Miley  
In 2006 I did Hannah Montana  
In 2008 I had my first album  
In 2009 Hannah Montana The Movie  
In 2010 I did "The Last Song"  
  
Now Here I am in snl  
I see Taylor...  
Spoken: Hi Taylor  
Rapping:... In the audience  
  
If you're wondering why I broke up with Nick Jonas...  
Nothing about that, about that now  
Cause I'm having a party on Saturday Night  
It's a party here in snl  
  
Spoken: Well Taylor Swift is not preforming. I am, but we'll have a great show
anyway. So stick around we'll be right back.

If you're looking for love  
Know that love don't live here anymore  
He left with my heart  
They both walked through that door, without me  
If you're trying to find pity well you need to look somewhere else  
'Cause I surely can't help you  
I'm hurting myself  
I've turned into someone else  
  
I used to believe love conquers all  
That's what seen in movies  
Come to find out it's not like that at all  
You see real life's much different  
  
I don't want to see you go  
Only want to see you smile  
It hurts so much just thinking of  
Felt like this for awhile  
I can't stand to see you there  
We cried we lied, cannot pretend to change the fact  
That what we had could make us feel alive again  
Hold me close, don't let me go, I hope  
Tell me that now is not the end  
  
If you're looking for love

He left with my heart  
They both walked through that door, without me  
If you're trying to find pity well you need to look somewhere else  
'Cause I surely can't help you  
I'm hurting myself  
I've turned into someone else..  
I've turned into someone else  
  
I used to believe love conquers all  
'Cause that's what I felt when you held me  
I thought you'd catch me if I fall  
And fill me up when I'm empty  
  
I don't want to see you go  
Only want to see you smile  
It hurts so much just thinking of  
Felt like this for awhile  
I can't stand to see you there  
We cried we lied, cannot pretend to change the fact  
That what we had could make us feel alive again  
Hold me close, don't let me go, I hope

'Cause I surely can't help you  
I'm hurting myself  
I've turned into someone else  
  
Love is patient, love is selfless  
Love is hopeful, love is kind  
Love is jealous, love is selfish  
Love is helpless, love is blind  
  
Love is patient, love is selfless  
Love is hopeful, love is kind  
Love is jealous, love is selfish  
Love is helpless, love is blind  
  
Love is patient, love is selfless  
Love is hopeful, love is kind  
Love is jealous, love is selfish  
Love is helpless, love is blind  
  
I've turned into someone else!

[Verse 1]  
Something in the way you love me  
Something in the way you stare  
I wanna be there skateboarding  
In a spacesuit, y volar  
  
[Verse 2]  
Something in the way you fuck me  
You're never fucking there  
Something in the way you touch me  
I wonder, I should care  
  
Ok, keep that last one  
  
[Verse 3]  
Sleeping is optimistic  
But we can live without dreaming  
It's the only time we can really be together  
But I'm optimistic  
There's something giving me that feeling  
There's something giving me that feeling  
There's something  
There's something giving me that feeling  
There's something

Miley - There's a photo of me being kissed by a dude,  
And Annie Leibovitz tryin'a get me nude,  
For those of you who think that's very crude...  
I'm sorry that I'm not perfect!  
  
I never stole a necklace or got a dui,  
I never cheated on my wife like that golfer guy,  
So what, you can see a little boob from the side...  
I'm sorry that I'm not perfect!  
  
And sure, I danced on a pole,  
And people called it sinning,  
But at least I didn't date a porn star,  
And tell everyone 'I'm winning'!  
  
(A Guy And A Girl Walk On Stage)  
  
Girl - She never made a dirty tape and passed it along,  
Guy - She didn't text a photo of her dong,  
Miley - Don't both of these things seem worse than a bong... !  
I'm sorry,  
I'm so Sorry,  
I'm really sorry... That I'm not perfect!

So, may I have your attention?  
Look in my direction,  
Here you'll see the sun never sets.  
No, we don't have to worry,  
Never in a hurry.  
One by one the stars go to bed,  
And I step into the spotlight again.  
  
Can't help myself,  
I've got to be,  
When lights are shining down on me.  
I want to feel the sun.  
So turn that walk into a run,  
Gonna bring the party when I come.  
Sing it out if you want to have some fun.  
  
And into the spotlight we will go,  
Follow me cause, baby, lifes a show.  
Into the spotlight you will see  
It's the only place to be.

Sound waves on the ocean.

Well just redo it.

[Verse:]  
I saw him,  
In the club,  
That night,  
I fell in love,  
He said,  
I know you want me,  
So let's hit the floor and party,  
Yeah  
  
[Pre-Hook:]

Tonight, it's alright,  
Oh, so can you come with me  
Let's go crazy,

It's true,  
You are some one,  
I don't wanna lose,  
Yeah, baby I know you want it,  
So let's go,

Stand by me and be my love tonight, oh!  
  
[Outro:]  
Oh yeah!

I have to wonder if this wave's too big to ride  
Commit or not commit in such a crazy tide  
It's sooner than I thought but you called me out  
I've lost control and there's no doubt  
I'm gonna start all over  
  
[Chorus]  
Out of the fire and into the fire again  
You make me want to forget  
And start all over  
Here it comes straight out of my mind or worse  
Another chance to get burned  
And start all over  
I'm gonna start all over  
  
Fantastic and romantic all a big surprise  
You've got the warning hesitation pushed aside  
It's sooner than i want but you caught my heart  
I guess I'm ready now to start  
I'm gonna start all over  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Repeat: x3]  
It's so easy  
You disrupt me  
Can't complain  
  
It's so easy  
I'm gonna start all over  
  
[Chorus: x2]

Well it's good to hear your voice  
I hope you're doing fine  
And if you ever wonder  
I'm lonely here tonight  
I'm lost here in this moment  
And time keeps slipping by  
And if I could have just one wish  
I'd have you by my side  
  
Ooh oh, I miss you  
Ooh oh, I need you  
  
I love you more than I did before  
And if today I don't see your face  
Nothing's changed, no one can take your place  
It gets harder, everyday  
  
Say you love me more than you did before  
And I'm sorry it's this way  
But I'm coming home, I'll be coming home  
And if you ask me I will stay, I will stay  
  
Well I try to live without you  
The tears fall from my eyes  
I'm alone and I feel empty  
God I'm torn apart inside  
  
I look up at the stars  
Hoping you're doing the same  
And somehow I feel closer and I can hear you say  
  
Ooh oh, I miss you  
Ooh oh, I need you  
  
I love you more than I did before  
And if today I don't see your face  
Nothing's changed, no one can take your place  
It gets harder, everyday  
  
Say you love me more than you did before  
And I'm sorry that it's this way  
But I'm coming home, I'll be coming home  
And if you ask me I will stay, I will stay  
Always stay  
I never wanna lose you  
And if I had to I would choose you  
So stay, please always stay  
You're the one that I hold onto  
'Cause my heart would stop without, you  
  
I love you more than I did before  
And if today I don't see your face  
Nothing's changed, no one could take your place  
It gets harder everyday  
  
Say you love me more than you did before  
And I'm sorry that it's this way  
But I'm coming home, I'll be coming home  
And if you ask me I will stay, I will stay  
I'll always stay  
  
And I love you more than I did before  
And I'm sorry that it's this way  
But I'm coming home, I'll be coming home  
And if you ask I will stay, I will stay  
I will stay

I don't care what you say to me. Just forget that that we were meant to be
(oooooh)  
You were never meant for me your jokes were biting me to the bone. And the
things we shared I couldn't bare...  
Chorus  
Sure I don't care you always get your way. I wanna hang up now (up now.) I
thought you were good guy at first but you always turning me down.  
Baby Baby just ignore me. We have no chemistry... (no no.)  
You hurt girls as fast as people blink no one wants to take that... (ah ah.)  
Chorus  
I'm sorry I have to say this but... Goodbye... Hahaha

The city of angels is lonely tonight  
Keep myself alight by candlelight  
So she can love you like I do  
Look me in the eyes and say it's true  
I ask myself is this love at all  
When I need you most, you let me fall  
I'm always here at the side of your stage  
Let you live your life  
Pretend I'm okay (don't you know)  
I'll be okay  
I'll hold you close we'll stay forever  
  
I, I don't understand why you're leaving me  
I, I don't understand, how without you I can breathe  
Please don't, don't leave me here  
Take my hand and breathe in deep  
I don't understand why you can't take me with you  
  
You can pretend I don't exist,  
But you will see my face every time you kiss  
I hope you heard any walls fall down,  
When you hear the sound that I'm okay (don't you know)  
I'll be okay  
You can't hold me down, I will stay forever  
  
I, I don't understand why you're leaving me  
I, I don't understand how without you I can breathe  
Please don't, don't leave me here  
Take my hand and breathe in deep  
I don't understand why you can't take me with you  
  
I watched you leave  
I'm awake tonight  
And I'm letting go for the last time  
And through the tears I say goodbye  
So breathe in, breathe in, breathe in, breathe out.  
  
I, I don't understand, why you're leaving me  
I, I don't understand how without you I can't breathe  
Please don't, don't leave me here  
Take my hand and breathe in deep  
I don't understand why you can't take me with you  
Don't leave me here  
Please don't leave me here  
I, I don't understand,  
How without you I can breathe  
Please don't, don't leave me here  
Take my hand and breathe in deep  
I don't understand why how can't take me with you

I can almost see it  
That dream I'm dreaming but  
There's a voice inside my head saying,  
You'll never reach it,  
Every step I'm taking,  
Every move I make feels  
Lost with no direction  
My faith is shaking but I  
Got to keep trying  
Got to keep my head held high  
  
There's always going to be another mountain  
I'm always going to want to make it move  
Always going to be an uphill battle,  
Sometimes I'm gonna to have to lose,  
Ain't about how fast I get there,  
Ain't about what's waiting on the other side  
It's the climb  
  
The struggles I'm facing,  
The chances I'm taking  
Sometimes might knock me down but  
No I'm not breaking  
I may not know it  
But these are the moments that  
I'm going to remember most yeah  
Just got to keep going  
And I,  
I got to be strong  
Just keep pushing on, cause  
  
There's always going to be another mountain  
I'm always going to want to make it move  
Always going to be an uphill battle,  
Sometimes I'm gonna to have to lose,  
Ain't about how fast I get there,  
Ain't about what's waiting on the other side  
It's the climb (yeah)  
  
There's always going to be another mountain  
I'm always going to want to make it move  
Always going to be an uphill battle,  
Sometimes you going to have to lose,  
Ain't about how fast I get there,  
Ain't about what's waiting on the other side  
It's the climb (yeah yeah ea ea)  
  
Keep on moving  
Keep climbing  
Keep the faith baby  
It's all about  
It's all about  
The climb  
Keep the faith  
Keep your faith  
  
Whoa oh oh

[Chorus]  
The sunrise insists on gladness  
But how can I be glad now my flower is dead  
Oh, sun, I see you happy  
You made the morning dew  
Now you're showing me the truth  
I don't want to believe you  
  
[Verse 1]  
The night has the power  
To hold all your helplessness in  
Heaven  
The darkness and sadness  
Hold to each other 'til tomorrow  
  
[Chorus]  
The sunrise insists on gladness  
But how can I be glad now my flower is dead  
Oh, sun, I see you happy  
You made the morning dew  
Now you're showing me the truth  
I don't want to believe you  
  
[Verse 2]  
Death, take me with you  
I don't wanna live without my flower  
Tomorrow, tomorrow  
The time that it takes for love to effect a person  
So deep, so deep  
So deep  
  
[Outro]  
Oh sun, oh sun  
Oh sun, oh sun  
Oh sun, oh sun  
I see you happy  
Oh sun, oh sun

The other side  
The other side  
The other side of me  
  
By day, I play  
The part in every way  
Of simple sweet, calm and collected  
  
Pretend, to my friends  
I'm a chameleon  
Can make a girl feel disconnected  
  
I feel like a star  
A super hero  
Sometimes it's hard to separate  
(Got to much on my plate)  
  
Chorus  
If you could see  
The other side of me  
I'm just like anybody else, can't you tell  
I hold the key  
To both realities  
The girl that I want you to know  
If only I could show  
  
2nd chorus  
The other side... The other side  
I want you to see  
The other side... The other side  
The other side of me  
  
Inside, I try  
To make the pieces fit right  
A jigsaw puzzle everywhere  
  
'Cause I flip the script  
So many times I forget  
Who's on stage, who's in the mirror  
  
Back in the spotlight  
The crowd is calling  
The paparazzi and the fame  
(It can drive a girl insane)  
  
Chorus  
  
2nd Chorus  
  
Down inside I'm not that different  
Like everyone, I have a dream  
Don't want to hide, just want to fit in  
Sometimes it's harder than it seems  
  
Chorus  
  
2nd Chorus

Seems like we're holding on forever  
I gotta let it go  
Times up, you pushed me to surrender (tonight)  
Who knows what's happens now whatever  
Wherever the wind blows  
And I'm there as long as were together  
Alright  
  
Lets have the time of our lives!  
Like there's no one else around  
Just throw your hands up high  
Even when they try to take us down  
We'll have the time of our lives  
Till the lights burn out  
Let's laugh until we cry  
Life is only what you make it now  
Let's have the time of our lives!  
  
Dreamers don't care if it's right  
I think I'm really into you  
Restless, let's leave it all behind  
And tonight  
  
Crazy when you cross my mind  
Oh the trouble we could get into  
So what let's just give this a try  
Alright  
  
Let's have the time of our lives!  
Like there's no one else around  
Just throw your hands up high  
Even when they try to take us down  
We'll have the time of our lives  
Till the lights burn out  
Let's laugh until we cry  
Life is only what you make it now  
Let's have the time of our lives!  
  
Lookin' back what are we waitin' for?  
Take the chance  
Now's all we got for sure!  
  
Let's have the time of our lives!  
Like there's no one else around  
Just throw your hands up high  
Even when they try to take us down  
We'll have the time of our lives  
Till the lights burn out  
Let's laugh until we cry  
Life is only what you make it now  
Let's have the time of our lives!

These four walls  
They whisper to me  
They know a secret  
I knew they would not keep  
It didn't take long  
For the room to fill with dust  
And these four walls came down around us  
  
It must have been something to send me out of my head  
With the words so radical and not what I meant  
Now I wait  
For a break in the silence 'cause it's all that you left  
Just me and these four walls again  
  
It's hard now to let you be  
I won't make excuses  
I've made my peace  
It didn't take long  
For me to lose the trust  
Cause these four walls  
Were not strong enough  
  
It must have been something to send me out of my head  
With the words so radical and not what I meant  
Now I wait  
For a break in the silence 'cause it's all that you left  
Just me and these four walls again  
  
Yeah  
It's difficult  
Watching us fade  
Knowing it's all my fault  
My mistake  
Yeah, and it's difficult  
Letting you down  
Knowing it's all my fault  
You're not around  
  
It must have been something to send me out of my head  
With the words so radical and not what I meant  
Now I wait  
For a break in the silence 'cause it's all that you left  
Just me and these four walls again  
  
Again  
These four walls again

Take the world  
Shake and Stir  
And that's what I got goin' on  
  
I throw my cares  
Up in the air  
And I don't think they're coming down  
Yeah, I love how it feels right now  
  
Chorus  
This is the life  
Hold on tight  
And this is the dream  
It's all I need  
You never know where you'll find it  
And I'm gonna take my time, yeah  
I'm still gettin' it right  
This is the life.  
  
Takin' in  
A whole new scene  
And I'm swimming with a new crowd  
  
Breakin' down  
The old four walls  
And I'm building them up from the ground  
Yeah, I love how it feels right now  
  
Chorus  
  
Gonna follow my own lead, yeah  
Kick back and feel the breeze  
Nothing but the blue sky  
As far as I can see  
  
Chorus 2x

We sign our cards  
And letters BFF  
You've got  
A million way  
To make me laugh  
You're looking out  
For me  
You've got my back  
It's So good  
To have you around  
You know the secrets  
I could never tell  
And when I'm quiet you  
Break through my shell  
Don't feel the need  
To do a rebel yell  
Cuz you keep my feet  
On the ground  
  
You're a true friend  
You're here till the end  
You pull me aside  
When somethin' ain't right  
Talk with me now  
And into the night  
Till it's alright again  
You're a true friend  
  
You don't get angry  
When I change the plans  
Somehow you're never out  
Of second chances  
You Won't say "I told you"  
When I'm wrong again  
I'm so lucky  
That I found  
  
A true friend  
You're here till the end  
You pull me aside  
When somethin' ain't right  
Talk with me now  
And into the night  
Till it's alright again  
  
True friends will go  
To the ends of the earth  
Till they find  
The things you need  
Friends hang on  
To the ups and the downs  
Cuz they got someone  
To believe in  
  
A true friend  
You're here 'til the end  
You pull me aside  
When somethin' ain't right  
Talk with me now  
And into the night,  
No need to pretend  
You're a true friend  
You're here 'til the end  
You pull me aside  
When somethin' ain't right  
Talk with me now  
And into the night  
'Til it's alright again  
  
You're a true friend  
You're a true friend  
You're a true friend

[Verse 1]  
I had a dream  
Davie Bowie taught us how to skateboard  
But he was shaped like Gumby  
And I had a dream  
Took a helicopter  
Flew it up too high, got stuck in the clouds  
Don't wanna come down  
And I had a dream  
We went on a safari  
I said look at that lion, she reminds me of you  
Cause you're the queen  
And I had a dream  
That you were dying  
But I wasn't even crying, I just sang you to sleep  
I sang you to sleep  
  
[Chorus]  
But what does it mean?  
What does it all mean?  
Oh, I had a dream  
What did it mean?  
What did it mean?  
  
[Verse 2]  
And I had a dream  
We robbed the record store  
The one with the yellow door  
We stole every goddamn record they had  
And I had a dream  
That I didn't give a fuck  
But I give a fuck  
I miss you so bad, I think I might die  
  
[Chorus - Extended]  
What does it mean  
What does it all mean?  
Oh, I had a dream  
What did it mean?  
What did it mean?  
I just wanna scream  
What does it mean?  
What does it mean?  
I just wanna scream  
I just wanna scream  
  
[Bridge]  
What does it mean?  
What does it mean? What does it mean?  
I had a dream  
What does it mean? What does it mean?  
I had a dream  
But what does it mean? What does it mean?  
What does it all mean?  
  
[Verse 3]  
And I had a dream  
We were being chased by a monster  
Maybe they were aliens  
But I wasn't scared cause you were there  
And I had a dream  
We took karate  
That's when you said you loved me  
You loved me  
  
[Outro]  
What does it mean?  
What does it all mean?  
What does it mean?  
What does it all mean?  
Fuck yeah

I need to feel your heartbeat  
When you say you love me  
I don't want to hear it  
If it's something that you don't mean  
  
If I had to leave you now  
There would be an empty space  
It doesn't matter anyhow  
You can take your things  
And go your own way  
  
And there's two more lonely people  
In the world tonight  
Baby, you and I  
Are just two more lonely people  
Who gave up the fight  
Yeah, wrong or right  
Well you know my heart is aching  
You don't have to break it  
If love don't change your mind  
Then there's two more lonely people tonight  
  
I don't want the pictures  
I don't want your sympathy  
We don't have to be friends  
We don't have to be enemies  
  
In my head I break it down  
And I'm absolutely sure  
That you and I could work it out  
Or we could kill the lights  
On what we had before  
  
And there's two more lonely people  
In the world tonight  
Baby, you and I  
Are just two more lonely people  
Who gave up the fight  
Yeah, wrong or right  
Well you know my heart is aching  
You don't have to break it  
If love don't change your mind  
Then there's two more lonely people  
  
Well, we got something special  
That should be enough  
Nothing is predictable  
When it comes to love  
Maybe lately baby  
It's been a little rough  
But if you walk away tonight  
  
We'll be two more lonely people  
In the world tonight  
Baby, you and I  
And just two more lonely people  
Who gave up the fight  
  
And there's two more lonely people  
In the world tonight  
Baby, you and I  
And just two more lonely people  
Who gave up the fight  
Yeah, wrong or right  
Well you know my heart is aching  
You don't have to break it  
If love don't change your mind  
Then there's two more lonely people tonight

Oh can you take of her  
Oh maybe you can spare her  
  
Several moments of your consideration  
Leading up to the final destination  
  
Oh the earth is calling out,  
I wanna learn what it's all about,  
But everything I read global warming going green  
I don't know what all this means but it seems to be saying  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Wake up America we're all in this together  
It's our home so let's take care of it  
You know that you want to  
You know that you got to wake up America  
Tomorrow becomes a new day and everything you do  
Matters yeah everything you do matters in some way  
  
Stand up I'll try if you will  
Wake up it's not a fire drill  
All she needs is a little attention  
Can you give her just a little attention'  
  
Uh oh it's easy to look away  
But it's getting harder day by day  
  
Everything I read global warming going green  
I don't know what all this means but it seems to be saying  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Wake up America we're all in this together  
It's our home so let's take care of it  
You know that you want to  
You know that you got to wake up America  
Tomorrow becomes a new day and everything you do  
Matters yeah everything you do matters in some way  
  
I know that you don't want to hear it  
Especially coming from someone so young  
  
But in the back seat yeah they want to hear it (they want to hear it)  
  
So come on (turn in up)  
Come on (turn it up)  
So come oooooooon (turn it up)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Wake up America we're all in this together  
It's our home so let's take care of it  
You know that you want to  
You know that you got to wake up America  
Tomorrow becomes a new day and everything you do  
Matters yeah everything you do matters in some way

Hey, I see you trying to tell them all about me  
Saying that I'm just a wannabe well guess what  
I don't need nobody else to help me on my way, I'm fine  
  
Hey hey, I hear you've started rumours 'bout my family  
Telling everybody that I'm in it for the money  
I'd give it all away before I'd let your words get through, alright?  
  
Cos somebody out there, somebody somewhere loves me for me and nobody else
will...  
Stop me from dreaming, stop me from believing  
I'm on my own tonight  
  
(Chorus:)  
And whatever comes, whatever goes  
Whatever happens I'll be fine  
I am strong, the world is mine  
And I suppose that if the doors close  
I'll pick up my strength and bash it down and build it up again, up again...  
  
You, I know you're trying to get me angry and mad  
I don't care I'm not gonna resort to being nasty  
I don't need nobody else to help me on my way, I'm fine  
  
You, you, I betcha any money that you're lonely  
Making me feel worse than yourself (yourself, yoursefl)  
I'd give it all away before I'd let your words get through, alright?  
  
Cos somebody out there, somebody somewhere loves me for me and nobody else
will...  
Stop me from dreaming, stop me from believing  
I'm on my own tonight  
  
(Chorus:)  
And whatever comes, whatever goes  
Whatever happens I'll be fine  
I am strong, the world is mine  
And I suppose that if the doors close  
I'll pick up my strength and bash it down and build it up again, up again...  
  
You can say whatever cos whatever comes I'll beat ya baby  
You can say whatever cos whatever comes I'll shine!  
  
(Chorus:)  
And whatever comes, whatever goes  
Whatever happens I'll be fine  
I am strong, the world is mine  
And I suppose that if the doors close  
I'll pick up my strength and bash it down and build it up again, up again...

Here we are now  
Everything is about to change  
We face tomorrow as we say goodbye to yesterday  
A chapter ending but the stories only just begun  
A page is turning for everyone  
So I'm moving on  
Letting go  
Holding on to tomorrow  
I've always got the memories while I'm finding out who I'm gonna be  
We might be apart but I hope you always know  
You'll be with me wherever I go  
Wherever I go  
So excited I can barely even catch my breath  
We have each other to lean on for the road ahead  
This happy ending is the start of all our dreams  
And I know your heart is with me  
So I'm moving on  
Letting go  
Holding on to tomorrow  
I've always got the memories while I'm finding out who I'm gonna be  
We might be apart but I hope you always know  
You'll be with me wherever I go  
It's time to show the world we've got something to say  
A song to sing out loud we'll never fade away  
I know I'll miss you but we'll meet again someday  
We'll never fade away  
So I'm moving on  
Letting go  
Holding on to tomorrow  
I've always got the memories while I'm finding out who I'm gonna be  
We might be apart but I hope you always know  
You'll be with me wherever I go  
So I'm moving on  
Letting go  
Holding on to tomorrow  
I've always got the memories while I'm finding out who I'm gonna be  
We might be apart but I hope you always know  
You'll be with me wherever I go  
Wherever, Wherever I go

Mafia  
  
Creation shows me what to do  
I'm dancing on the floor with you And when you touch my hand  
I go crazy, yeah  
The music tells me what to feel  
I like you now  
But is it real by the time we say goodnight  
I'll know if this is right  
And I feel you (you) coming through my veins.  
Am I into you (you) or is it the music to blame?  
  
Who owns my heart  
Is it love or is it art  
Cause the way you got your body movin' got me confusin'  
And I can't tell if it's the beat or sparks  
Who owns my heart  
Is it love or is it art  
You know I wanna believe that we're a masterpiece  
But sometimes it's hard to tell in the dark  
Who owns my heart  
  
The room is full  
But all I see is the way  
Your eyes just blaze through me  
Like fire in the dark  
We're like living art  
And it hits me  
Like a tidal wave  
Are you feeling me  
Or is the music to blame  
  
Who owns my heart  
Is it love or is it art  
Cause the way you got your body movin' got me confusin'  
And I can't tell if it's the beat or sparks  
Who owns my heart  
Is it love or is it art  
You know I wanna believe that we're a masterpiece  
But sometimes it's hard to tell in the dark  
Who owns my heart  
  
So come on, baby  
Keep provoking me  
Keep on roping me  
Like a rodeo  
Baby, pull me close  
Come on  
Here we go  
Here we go  
Here we go  
  
And it hits me  
Like a tidal wave  
Are you feeling me  
Or is the music to blame  
  
Who owns my heart  
Is it love or is it art  
Cause the way you got your body movin' got me confusin'  
And I can't tell if it's the beat or sparks  
Who owns my heart  
Is it love or is it art  
You know I wanna believe that we're a masterpiece  
But sometimes it's hard to tell in the dark  
Who owns my heart

I'm more than just your average girl  
I like to turn me up and show the world  
Aw yeah  
'Cause some can talk the talk  
But this girl just wants to rock  
I'm individual  
I'm not like anyone  
  
I can be glamorous  
Just like you see in all the magazines  
I can be cool as ice  
Or anything I wanna be  
Wooo  
  
Who said, who said  
I can't be Superman  
I say, I say  
That I know I can  
Who said, who said  
I won't be president  
I say, I say  
You ain't seen nothin' yet  
  
Oh yeah  
Yeah  
Go on and make some noise  
Every girl has her choice  
To lead their own parade  
I do it my way  
Ow  
  
I can be soft and sweet  
Or louder than the radio  
I can be sophisticated  
Or totally go... outta control  
Wooo  
  
Who said, who said  
I can't be Superman  
I say, I say  
That I know I can  
Who said, who said  
I'm not electrified  
I say, I say  
  
There's no holdin' back  
Stayin' right on track  
'Cause you control the game  
So let 'em know your name  
No limitations on imagination  
Imagine that  
Yeah  
  
Who said, who said  
I can't be worldwide  
I say, I say  
Time is on my side  
  
Who said, who said  
I can't be 10 feet tall  
I say, I say  
That I can have it all  
  
Who said, who said  
I can't be Superman  
I say, I say  
That I know I can  
Who said, who said  
I won't be president  
I say, I say  
You ain't seen nothin' yet  
You ain't seen nothin' yet  
Whoa  
Yeah  
Who said  
C'mon  
Yeah  
That's right

Looks like we found ourselves  
Up against a wall  
In need of a little help  
But no one wants to call  
After all we've been through  
Do we let our friendship end  
You need me and I need you  
No, we will not break  
Never break  
But even if we bend,  
  
Yeah, it's  
Chorus  
YOU AND ME TOGETHER (together, together, together)  
ALWAYS ON YOUR SIDE [on your side]  
NO ONE, NO ONE, NO ONE CAN EVER CHANGE IT  
C'MON LET EM TRY [let em try]  
CAUSE IT'S YOU AND ME TOGETHER NOW  
  
Anyone can have a day  
When their heart is on their sleeve  
No one wants to see a way  
And agree to disagree  
You'd think it'd be easier  
But it feels like you just can't win  
But somehow we'll make it work  
Cause we deserve it- we know we're worth it  
You can't give up on friends  
  
'Cause it's  
Repeat Chorus  
  
TOGETHER NOW  
Oh, now, now, now  
  
It's  
YOU AND ME TOGETHER [together, together, together]  
ALWAYS ON YOUR SIDE [on your side]  
Oh, whoa-whoa  
NO ONE, NO ONE, NO ONE CAN EVER CHANGE IT  
C'MON LET EM TRY (let em try)  
  
It's  
YOU [it's you] AND ME [and me] TOGETHER [together, together, together]  
Yeah, I'm ALWAYS ON YOUR SIDE [on your, on your side]  
NO ONE, NO ONE, NO ONE CAN EVER CHANGE IT  
C'MON LET EM TRY  
[Let em try]  
Cuz it's you and me together ah-ah-ah-ah-ah  
Together now, now  
Together now, now

You wake up, it's raining and it's monday  
Looks like one of those rough days  
Time's up, you're late again, so get out the door (Out the door)  
Sometimes you feel like running  
Find a whole new life and jump in  
Let go, get out and hit the dance floor  
'Cause when the lights go down it's the ending of the show  
And you're feeling like you got knowhere to go  
Don't you know  
  
You can change your hair and you can change your clothes  
You can change your mind, that's just the way it goes  
You can say goodbye, and you can say hello  
But you'll always find your way back home  
You can change your style, and you can change your jeans  
You can learn to fly and you can chase your dreams  
You can laugh and cry but everybody knows  
You'll always find your way back home  
  
Your best friends, your little hometown  
Are waiting up wherever you go now  
You know that you can always turn around  
Cause this world is big and it's crazy (crazy)  
And this girl is thinking that maybe  
This life is what some people dream about  
Cause when I'm feeling down and I am all alone (woah, Woah)  
I've always got a place where I can go  
Cause I know  
  
You can change your hair and you can change your clothes  
You can change your mind, that's just the way it goes  
You can say goodbye, you can say hello  
But you'll always find your way back home  
You can change your style, and you can change your jeans  
You can learn to fly and you can chase your dreams  
You can laugh and cry but everybody knows  
You'll always find your way back home  
  
Where they know exactly who you are  
The real you is the superstar  
You know it's never too far away  
  
You can change your hair and you can change your clothes  
You can change your mind, that's just the way it goes  
You can say goodbye, you can say hello  
But you'll always find your way back home  
  
You can change your hair and you can change your clothes  
You can change your mind, that's just the way it goes  
You can say goodbye, you can say hello  
But you'll always find your way back home  
You can change your style, and you can change your jeans  
You can learn to fly and you can chase your dreams  
You can laugh and cry but everybody knows  
You'll always find your way back home  
  
You'll always find your way back home...  
You'll always find your way back home...  
You'll always find your way back home...

I've seen love go by my door  
It's never been this close before  
Never been so easy or so slow  
Been shooting in the dark too long  
When somethin's not right it's wrong  
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go  
  
Dragon clouds so high above  
I've only known careless love  
It's always hit me from below  
This time around it's more correct  
Right on target, so direct  
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go  
  
Purple clover, Queen Anne's Lace  
Crimson hair across your face  
You could make me cry if you don't know  
Can't remember what I was thinkin' of  
You might be spoilin' me too much, love  
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go  
  
Flowers on the hillside, bloomin' crazy  
Crickets talkin' back and forth in rhyme  
Blue river runnin' slow and lazy  
  
I could stay with you forever and never realize the time  
  
Situations have ended sad  
Relationships have all been bad  
Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud  
But there's no way I can compare  
All those scenes to this affair  
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go  
  
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doin'  
Stayin' far behind without you  
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm sayin'  
You're gonna make me give myself a good talkin' to  
  
I'll look for you in old Honolulu  
San Francisco, Ashtabula  
Yer gonna have to leave me now, I know  
But I'll see you in the sky above  
In the tall grass, in the ones I love  
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go  
Ooh, you're gonna make me lonesome when you go  
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go  
  
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

Zip-a-dee-doo-dah  
Zip-a-dee-ay-ay-ay  
My my my my my what a  
Wonderful day-ay-ay  
Plenty of sunshine  
Headin' my way-ay-ay  
Zip-a-dee-doo-dah-ah-ah-ah  
Zip-a-dee-ay

Oh-oh Mr. Bluebir-ird on my shoulder-er
