Stripped to the waist  
We fall into the river  
Cover your eyes  
So you don't know the secret  
I've been trying to hide  
We held our breath  
To see our names are written  
On the wreck of '86  
That was the year  
I knew the panic was over  
  
Yes since we found out  
Since we found out  
That anything could happen  
Anything could happen  
Anything could happen  
Anything could happen  
Anything could happen  
Anything could happen  
Anything could  
  
After the war we said we'd fight together  
I guess we thought that's just what humans do  
Letting darkness grow  
As if we need it's palette and we need it's color  
But now I've seen it through  
And now I know the truth  
  
That anything could happen  
Anything could happen  
Anything could happen  
Anything could happen  
Anything could happen  
Anything could happen  
Anything could  
  
Baby, I'll give you everything you need  
I'll give you everything you need, oh  
I'll give you everything you need  
But I don't think I need you  
  
Stripped to the waist  
We fall into the river  
Cover your eyes  
So you don't know the secret  
I've been trying to hide  
We held our breath  
To see our names are written  
On the wreck of '86  
That was the year  
I knew the panic was over  
  
Yes since we found out  
Since we found out  
That anything could happen  
Anything could happen  
Anything could happen  
Anything could happen  
Anything could happen  
Anything could happen  
Anything could  
  
I know it's gonna be  
I know it's gonna be  
I know it's gonna be  
I know it's gonna be  
I know it's gonna be  
I know it's gonna be  
I know it's gonna be  
I know it's gonna be  
  
(But I don't think I need you)  
(But I don't think I need you)  
(But I don't think I need you)  
(But I don't think I need you)

Listen  
I can hear a voice  
I need a helping hand  
Just to beat the void  
I need a mission  
A dream to stop me talking to myself  
  
And now the silence is broken  
And my soul is to sell  
I need to pick up the pieces  
To scatter to the wind  
Hold the city to your ears  
You can hear the wind come in  
  
But you can't change the world with a song  
And you can't make it right when it's wrong  
  
I can't stop this music traveling round with me wherever I go  
It's playing for you  
I can't stop the voice unraveling round me whatever I do  
It's talking to you  
The world dances to the rhythm of its own  
Heart beating for you, however you lose  
So speak to me  
Believe, believe, believe me  
  
Don't let it slip, through your fingertips  
When there's a ghost  
Don't try to reason with it  
Because now I'm tired  
I'm wired  
So I won't miss a think  
I rope my words out to dry  
And I've forgotten what to sing  
But you can't change the world  
With a song and you can't make it right when it's wrong  
  
I can't stop this music traveling round with me wherever I go  
It's playing for you  
I can't stop the voice unraveling round me whatever I do  
It's talking to you  
The world dances to the rhythm of its own  
Heart beating for you, however you lose  
So speak to me  
Believe, believe, believe me.  
  
If that's what it was to you,  
Then that's what it was to me.  
If that's what it was to you,  
Then that's what it was to me.  
If that's what it was to you,  
Then that's what it was to me.  
  
But you can't change the world  
With a song and you can't make it right when it's wrong  
  
I can't stop this music traveling round with me wherever I go  
It's playing for you  
I can't stop the voice unraveling round me whatever I do  
It's talking to you  
The world dances to the rhythm of its own  
Heart beating for you, however you lose  
So speak to me  
Believe, believe, believe me  
Believe, believe, believe me

We, we don't have to worry bout nothing  
'Cause we got the fire, and we're burning one hell of a something  
They, they gonna see us from outer space, outer space  
Light it up, like we're the stars of the human race, human race

We don't wanna leave, no, we just gonna be right now  
And what we see, is everybody's on the floor  
Acting crazy getting loco to the lights out  
Music's on, I'm waking up, we stop the vibe, and we turn it up  
And it's over now, we got the love, there's no secret now, no secret now  
  
When the lights started out, they don't know what they heard

We'll be raising our hands, shining up to the sky  
'Cause we got the fire, fire, fire, yeah we got the fire fire fire  
  
And we gonna let it burn

[Verse 1]  
Open up and let me in  
Show the bruises on your skin  
Let the fires all burn out  
I can hear the silent shout in you  
Let it go don't be so scared  
Find the love you lost again  
Let the chaos disappear  
Don't you know I'm always here for you?  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause this is devotion, I am lost  
You're the only one I see  
Our bodies in motion, I am caught  
Floating in your gravity  
Whenever you break, I'll fix it for you  
I'm the one who drives to you at night  
And maybe we'll fall a little deeper  
I think our little hearts will be alright  
Cause this is devotion  
  
[Verse 2]  
Tell me what you dream about  
I lose you in my sleep, somehow  
Let the chaos disappear  
Don't you know I'm always there for you?  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause this is devotion, I am lost  
You're the only one I see  
Our bodies in motion, I am caught  
Floating in your gravity  
Whenever you break, I'll fix it for you  
I'm the one who drives to you at night  
And maybe we'll fall a little deeper  
I think our little hearts will be alright  
Cause this is devotion  
  
[Bridge]  
Cause this is devotion, I am lost  
You're the only one I see  
Our bodies in motion, I am caught  
Floating in your gravity  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause this is devotion, I am lost  
You're the only one I see  
Our bodies in motion, I am caught  
Floating in your gravity  
Whenever you break, I'll fix it for you  
I'm the one who drives to you at night  
And maybe we'll fall a little deeper  
I think our little hearts will be alright  
Cause this is devotion

[Verse 1]  
I've been too numb to understand  
I'm just a victim of the weapon in my hand  
So many casualties of love  
But I've been bulletproof, I'm staring at the sun  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I was the one you took home  
Never a flame to burn slow  
But I was hoping you'd see me a different way  
So many bodies I've touched  
Crushing around me like dust  
You are the realest thing I've never had to fake  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't need nobody, need nobody but  
I don't need nobody, need nobody but you  
I don't need nobody, need nobody but you  
I don't need nobody, need nobody but you  
  
[Verse 2]  
I'm just so used to emptiness  
Can't feel your heartbeat when I'm lying on your chest  
You're different from the ones before  
I know you don't believe it's you I've waited for  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I was the one you took home  
Never a flame to burn slow  
But I was hoping you'd see me a different way  
So many bodies I've touched  
Crushing around me like dust  
You are the realest thing I've never had to fake  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't need nobody, need nobody but  
I don't need nobody, need nobody but you  
I don't need nobody, need nobody but you  
I don't need nobody, need nobody but you  
  
[Bridge]  
But I was hoping you'd see me a different way  
You are the realest thing I've never had to fake  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't need nobody, need nobody but  
I don't need nobody, need nobody but you  
I don't need nobody, need nobody but you  
I don't need nobody, need nobody but you

[Verse 1]  
Bite down on your lip  
Take another sip  
Stop checking your phone  
Looking for the answers  
Mind running obsessed  
Feeling paralyzed  
Let me watch you undress  
Fall into the night  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Yeah, we change and we change and we feel so lost  
And we don't know who we are  
Yeah, we break and we break and we just can't stop  
So we just keep breaking hearts  
  
[Chorus]  
Why you wanna ruin a good thing?  
Can we take it back to the start?  
When love's not playing out like the movies  
It doesn't mean it's falling apart  
Don't panic  
Don't panic  
  
[Verse 2]  
Been shattered before  
Everything breaks  
I can't really be sure  
Of our mistakes  
Come under my love  
Like an umbrella  
Going to make you feel good  
Yeah, better than ever  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Yeah, we change and we change and we feel so lost  
And we don't know who we are  
Yeah, we break and we break and we just can't stop  
So we just keep breaking hearts  
  
[Chorus]  
Why you wanna ruin a good thing?  
Can we take it back to the start?  
When love's not playing out like the movies  
It doesn't mean it's falling apart  
Don't panic  
Don't panic  
  
[Bridge]  
I got big dreams baby  
I got big dreams baby  
So don't you over complicate it  
I got big dreams baby  
I got big dreams baby  
So don't you, don't you over complicate it  
  
[Chorus]  
Why you wanna ruin a good thing?  
Can we take it back to the start?  
When love's not playing out like the movies  
It doesn't mean it's falling apart  
Don't panic  
Don't panic  
Don't panic  
Don't panic

If you'd never said anything  
If you'd never said anything  
If you never, If you never  
If you never, If you'd never said anything  
  
If you never, if you never  
Ohhhh  
If you never, if you never  
Ohhhh  
If you never, if you never  
Ohhhh  
If you never, if you never  
  
Here it is in my hands  
In my veins, and overlands  
It spreads like fire, seeking air  
To pull me in, my own funfair  
Won't you come, won't you come  
Won't you come, just don't say a word  
Won't you come, won't you come  
Won't you come, just don't say a word  
  
If you never, if you never  
Just hold sway away  
If you never, if you never  
Just hold sway away  
  
I'm more alive I've ever been  
So now I give you all my sins  
I've chosen you, I've chosen you  
But don't say a word  
  
And if I save us, and I fall down  
I will leave your words behind now  
If you never, held me under, if you never hear my thunder  
  
If you never, if you never  
Oh  
If you never, if you never  
Oh  
If you never, if you never  
Just don't say a word

Every time you go  
Every time you go  
  
It starts with a picture  
And it sits in your frame  
And we part with a letter  
And it ends in my name  
It starts with forever  
And it ends with a touch  
And I know that you're clever  
And I don't ask for much oh  
  
Maybe we forgot all the things we are  
When we are together  
  
You said I'm arresting  
You said I had heat  
I really thought that we would go further  
The second time we'd meet  
'Cause I'm tired of trying to keep you  
All I want to do is sleep  
But perhaps when I'm sleeping  
You'll get back on your feet  
  
Maybe we forgot all the things we are  
When we are together  
  
Wake me up  
Wake me up  
Stop my fall  
Every time you go  
Tape me up  
Then break me up  
Ever so gently  
When I'm at my weakest  
It's not so hard  
Every time you go  
  
I run out to meet you  
When I knew the storm had come  
And I felt the rain on your face  
And the damage you have done  
And I know what you're thinking  
It will never be the end  
And when the storm is over  
You won't see me again  
Do know all the regrets I paid  
For all the times I saved we were together  
  
Wake me up  
Stop my fall  
Every time you go  
Tape me up  
Then break me up  
Ever so gently  
When I'm my weakest  
It's not so hard  
  
Maybe we forgot, are we awake, or not?  
Maybe we forgot, are we awake, or not?  
Maybe we forgot, are we awake, or not?  
Maybe we forgot  
  
Wake me up  
Wake me up  
Stop my fall  
Every time you go  
Tape me up  
Then break me up  
Ever so gently  
When I'm at my weakest  
  
Wake me up  
Wake me up  
Stop my fall  
Every time you go  
Tape me up  
Then break me up  
Ever so gently  
When I'm at my weakest  
It's not so hard  
Every time you go

You trembled like you'd seen a ghost  
And I gave in  
I lack the things you need the most  
You said where have you been  
You wasted all that sweetness to run and hide  
I wonder why  
I remind you of the days you poured your heart into  
But you never tried  
I've fallen from grace  
Took a blow to my face  
I've loved and I've lost  
I've loved and I've lost  
  
Explosions on the day you wake up  
Needing somebody and you've learned  
It's okay to be afraid  
But it will never be the same  
It will never be the same  
  
You left my soul bleeding in the dark  
So you could be king  
The rules you set are still untold to me and I  
Lost my faith in everything  
The nights you could cope, your intentions were gold  
But the mountains will shake  
I need to know I can still make  
  
Explosions on the day you wake up  
Needing somebody and you've learned  
It's okay to be afraid  
But it will never be the same  
  
And as the floods move in  
And your body starts to sink  
I was the last thing on your mind  
I know you better than you think  
'Cause it's simple darling, I gave you a warning  
Now everything you own is falling from the sky in pieces  
So watch them fall with you, in slow motion  
I pray that you will find peace of mind  
And I'll find you another time  
I'll love you, another time  
  
Explosions on the day you wake up  
Needing somebody and you've learned  
It's okay to be afraid  
But it will never be the same

Breathe your smoke into my lungs  
In the back of the car with you I stare into the sun  
Still not too old to die young  
The lovers hold on to everything  
And others hold on to anything  
  
I chased your love around a figure 8  
I need you more than I can take  
You promised forever and a day  
And then you take it all away  
(And then you take it all away)  
  
Place a kiss on my cheekbone  
Then you vanish me  
I'm buried in the snow  
But something tells me I'm not alone  
But lovers hold on to everything  
And others hold on to anything  
  
I chased your love around a figure 8  
I need you more than I can take  
You promised forever and a day  
And then you take it all away  
  
So, Lovers hold on to everything  
And others hold to anything  
So, Lovers hold on to everything  
And others hold to anything  
  
I chased your love around a figure 8  
I need you more than I can take  
You promised forever and a day  
And then you take it all away  
  
I chased your love around a figure 8  
I need you more than I can take  
You promised forever and a day  
And then you take it all away  
(And then you take it all away)

In the window, faces staring right past me,  
They're on a date feeling happy, yet I go in there and sit with them.  
Make them laugh, and be normal for an hour and a half of someones time, but
not mine.  
'Cause I just fly fly fly, only fly fly fly.  
When things are moving so fast you don't have to take them in.  
When you're falling apart you don't even have to think about it, about it.  
  
Know every station off by heart.  
Never get off just go back to the start of my journey, and I'm never as young
as I want to be.  
I'll think I'll never worry if I fly fly fly.  
I'll just fly.  
When things are moving so fast you don't have to take them in.  
When you're falling apart you don't even have to think about it, about it.  
  
Some day the sky will run out.  
The ground will pull me back down, back down to thinking straight,  
Never being late for love that I haven't found.  
But maybe I should try, maybe I should try.  
  
My bag is heavy, I feel weak,  
Talk to people but they don't speak.  
Always moving but I still don't know where I'm going.  
But that okay because I'll fly fly fly, I'll just fly fly fly.  
When things are moving so fast you don't have to take them in.  
When you're falling apart you don't even have to think about it, about it.  
  
I'll just fly, I'll just fly.

Baby you say you have a little song for me  
But you're wearing shades and your eyes look real dark underneath  
Baby I'm worried you'll get it wrong for me  
There's four love songs so which one did you write for me?  
Baby you haven't been getting along with me  
If you play the song, I know whether to stay or cry or leave  
  
In the first song you love me, but you don't think I love you  
In the second I love you but you leave  
In the third song you're confused til the day I set you free  
On the fourth, someone else is loving me, loving me  
  
Baby I'm waiting to hear your song for me  
Cuz there's been delays since I asked if you're in love with me  
And baby the songs you write are not happy  
I can't find a line like "I love you" and "you love me"  
Baby I no longer think you belong to me  
So I got the song, but you lost the girl, goodbye from me  
  
In the first song you love me, but you don't think I love you  
In the second I love you but you leave  
In the third song you're confused til the day I set you free  
On the fourth, someone else is loving me, loving me  
  
Baby I'm worried you'll get it wrong for me  
There's four love songs, so which one did you write for me?  
  
And in the first song you love me, but you don't think I love you  
In the second I love you but you leave  
In the third song you're confused til the day I set you free  
On the fourth, someone else is loving me, someone else is loving me

I lost the signal and put you away  
Swore upon the sun I'd save you for a rainy day  
Loosen the noose and let go of the rope  
I know if it's never coming back it has to go  
  
I keep callin' your name, keep callin' your name  
I wanna hold you close but I never wanna feel ashamed  
So I keep callin' at night, keep callin' at night  
I wanna hold you close I just never I wanna hold you tight  
  
Goodness gracious I can see the stars  
Callin' me out, callin' me out just to keep crawlin' into your arms  
Goodness gracious I can see the stars  
Callin' me out, callin' me out just to keep crawlin' into your arms  
  
I found the weakness and put it to play  
Swore upon the stars I'd keep you til the night was day  
Shake my head dizzy so I'll never know  
You said if you're never comin' back you have to go  
  
I keep callin' your name, keep callin' your name  
I wanna hold you close but I never wanna feel ashamed  
So I keep callin' at night, keep callin' at night  
I wanna hold you close I just never wanna hold you tight  
  
Goodness gracious I can see the stars  
Callin' me out, callin' me out just to keep crawlin' into your arms  
Goodness gracious I can see the stars  
Callin' me out, callin' me out just to keep crawlin' into your arms  
  
Ah, callin' me out just to keep crawlin' into your arms  
Callin' me out just to keep crawlin' into your arms  
  
Oh my goodness, here I go again  
Pullin' you back to me, pullin' you back into my arms so selfishly  
I don't think I understand 'cause I don't really know myself  
I keep callin' you callin' you out  
Callin' you out, callin' you out, callin' you out  
  
Goodness gracious I can see the stars  
Callin' me out callin' me out just to keep crawlin' into your arms  
Goodness gracious I can see the stars  
Callin' me out callin' me out just to keep crawlin' into your arms  
  
Ah, ah, callin' me out just to keep crawlin' into your arms  
Ah, ah, callin' me out just to keep crawlin' into your arms

You know we can get away  
Because I'm calling your name  
Every day I feel this pain  
But you just turn and walk away  
  
I just can't keep hanging on  
to you and me  
I just don't know what is wrong  
with you and me  
  
Touch me and then turn away  
And put your hands into the flame  
Tell me if you feel this pain  
'Cause I don't want to be a ball and chain, no  
  
I just can't keep hanging on, to you and me  
I just don't know what is wrong  
  
Give me the respect, forgive me and forget  
We've got to get a grip, living on the edge  
I barely even know this fucking woman in my bed  
And if that's too much on my plate, then I ain't finishing my bad  
And if anybody said the grass is greener on the other side  
Well it ain't, swear on my mother's life  
You got me wrapped up in your shit  
I'm feeling mamba fight  
I've only ever had this fucking feeling in my stomach twice  
You gave me what I needed, and I gave her everything she wanted  
Miss something 'bout your cleavage  
Now why can't put my fingers on it  
You're taking me the deepest  
I thought that she was coming for me  
If four women from Venus, then I guess I really got a rocket  
You've got a nose around my neck, but I'm still hanging on  
We've nearly reached the finish line, I bet we're having fun  
I spit a buzz, she sang a song  
She broke my heart, I took some garbage scan  
  
I just can't keep hanging on, with you, with me  
With you, with

Have yourself a merry little Christmas  
Let your heart be light  
From now on your troubles will be out, of sight  
  
Have yourself a merry little Christmas  
Let the yuletide gay  
From now on your troubles will be miles away  
  
Here we are, as in olden days  
Happy golden days, of yore  
Faithful friends, who are dear to us  
Gather near to us, once more  
  
Someday soon, we all will be together  
If the fates allow  
Until then, we'll have to muddle through, somehow  
  
And have yourself a merry little Christmas, now

[Verse 1]  
When you appeared  
I was just lonely  
I was just in need of a friend  
Spend your days  
Thinking if only  
Thinking if only you and me made sense  
For any love  
Quit the pain you feel  
You won't let it go  
You won't let it heal  
Baby, it's clear  
You don't know me  
You don't know me  
  
[Chorus]  
And I don't have the heart that you think I do  
And you give me so much, it's too much to lose  
You know I'm not the one  
Baby, I'm not the one  
I can't show you my love that you showed to me  
When it isn't enough, I won't make-believe  
You know I'm not the one  
Baby, leave love alone  
Let it heal  
Let it heal  
  
[Verse 2]  
It's in your eyes  
I can see that you're broken  
I know you're lost because I am too  
It's in your voice  
I hear you choking  
When did the illusion take the truth  
I think you're in love  
With the pain you feel  
You won't let it go  
You won't let it heal  
Baby it's clear  
You don't even know me  
You don't even know me  
  
[Chorus]  
And I don't have the heart that you think I do  
And you give me so much, it's too much to lose  
You know I'm not the one  
Baby, I'm not the one  
I can't show you my love that you showed to me  
When it isn't enough, I won't make-believe  
You know I'm not the one  
Baby, leave love alone  
Let it heal  
Let it heal  
  
[Bridge]  
You lit the fire and you held it in your hands until it flickered out  
It wasn't innocent, you've measured every inch of love you've given now  
You lit the fire and you held it in your hands until it flickered out  
It wasn't innocent, you've measured every inch of love you've given now  
  
[Chorus]  
And I don't have the heart that you think I do  
And you give me so much, it's too much to lose  
You know I'm not the one  
Baby, I'm not the one  
I can't show you my love that you showed to me  
When it isn't enough, I won't make-believe  
You know I'm not the one  
Baby, leave love alone  
Let it heal  
Let it heal

You wake up and you know it's time to go  
With spending heads I lie on what you smoke  
Chase the hands on the wall, can hold you close  
This misery is weightless as a stone  
  
Have you lost the scendings I have lost?  
Do you know that panic I know?  
Would I see the terror in your eyes  
Did you know that fever I know?  
I wish time was still  
We'd stay right here  
With time to keep in our hearts without chains  
  
And if time was still  
We'd have no fear, or scars to heal  
In our hearts without chains  
In our hearts without chains

[Verse 1]  
You're falling at your feet, giving everything up  
There's something in the way, love is never enough  
I see your sorry how I'm burning down the gun  
With a war in your mind that never wants to be won  
I catch you in a light no one else can see  
I know you see her, and you'll never see me  
She makes you feel the most, keep your souls alive  
But what we had, it never really died  
  
[Chorus]  
And this is what I'll say if I had any words  
Wish we hadn't messed up, now your heart is with hers  
And I know that your love wasn't here to stay  
I gave you all of mine but you gave it away  
And now you're the one who hurts  
You had to love someone else just to know your worth  
  
[Verse 2]  
But here's to us, here's to us, here's to us  
Yeah, this is just a phase, pretty sure of that  
And one day, you and I, we will never look back  
You kept me in the flames but the fire was out, the fire was out  
  
[Chorus]  
And this is what I'll say if I had any words  
Wish we hadn't messed up, now your heart is with hers  
And I know that your love wasn't here to stay  
I gave you all of mine but you gave it away  
And now you're the one who hurts  
You had to love someone else just to know your worth  
  
[Bridge: Harmonization]  
Ah, oh, oh, ah, ah, oh  
Ah, oh, oh, ah, ah, oh  
Ah, oh, oh, ah, ah, oh  
Ah, oh, oh, ah, ah, oh  
  
[Chorus]  
And this is what I'll say if I had any words  
Wish we hadn't messed up, now your heart is with hers  
And I know that your love wasn't here to stay  
I gave you all of mine but you gave it away  
And now you're the one who hurts  
You had to love someone else just to know your worth  
  
[Outro]  
But here's to us, here's to us, here's to us

[Verse 1]  
Enemy, used to be  
Part of you, bittersweet  
But now you tell me lies  
Up and down, cold and hot  
Swear to God, got to stop  
Because I can't sleep at night  
  
[Refrain]  
If you wanted love like this  
Blowing up with every kiss  
Should've known better  
Because you find yourself alone  
Chilling you right to the bone  
No, should've known better  
  
[Chorus]  
You and me just  
Running towards the light  
Giving up the fight  
Hoping we survive  
You and me just  
Strangers in the night  
Giving up the fight  
Waiting to ignite  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
  
[Verse 2]  
Lost in you, lost in me  
Afraid of love, in too deep  
So we just run and hide  
Lightning fast, felt the crash  
Scared to lose, fear attacks  
We only know goodbye  
  
[Chorus]  
You and me just  
Running towards the light  
Giving up the fight  
Hoping we survive  
You and me just  
Strangers in the night  
Giving up the fight  
Waiting to ignite  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
  
[Refrain]  
If you wanted love like this  
Blowing up with every kiss  
Should've known better  
Because you find yourself alone  
Chilling you right to the bone  
No, should've known better  
  
[Bridge]  
Hopelessly holding on  
To all those perfect nights  
Let's pretend it's not gone  
And say we'll never die  
  
[Chorus]  
You and me just  
Running towards the light  
Giving up the fight  
Hoping we survive  
You and me just  
Strangers in the night  
Giving up the fight  
Waiting to ignite  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
  
[Outro]  
Hopelessly holding on  
To all those perfect nights  
Let's pretend it's not gone  
And say we'll never die  
Say we'll never die

Lonely thoughts,  
They seep into mind, into me  
Brush your teeth  
Wash the dirt,  
A hard days work, know my place  
  
On my own  
No poison in my bones  
On my own  
This is where I build my home  
  
My home  
This will always be my home  
This will always be my home  
  
I work until its late  
Will again close the gates  
I look in the window and I gaze on my face  
Every line and every abrasion  
This took my life to make  
This took my life to make  
  
On my own  
No poison in my bones  
On my own  
This is where I build my home  
  
I need someone to hold  
I need someone to hold  
  
On my own  
  
My home  
This will always be my home  
This will always be my home

How long will I love you  
As long as stars are above you  
And longer if I can  
How long will I need you  
As long as the seasons need to  
Follow their plan  
  
How long will I be with you  
As long as the sea is bound to  
Wash up on the sand  
  
How long will I want you  
As long as you want me to  
And longer by far  
How long will I hold you  
As long as your father told you  
As long as you can  
  
How long will I give to you  
As long as I live through you  
However long you say  
  
How long will I love you  
As long as stars are above you  
And longer if I may  
  
How long will I love you  
As long as stars are above you

Human behave yourself,  
You have burst at the seams  
Let it all fall out open your mouth  
Often I lie wide awake,  
Think of things I can make  
But I don't seem to have the parts to build them  
Human I wonder why you're a better make  
Than I could ever build or create,  
You know not love or hate  
I am so scared of what will kill me  
In the end for I am not prepared,  
I hope I will get the chance to be someone,  
To be human,  
Look what we've done,  
Look what we've done  
  
I would give my life, to be human  
I would give my life, to be human  
I would give my life, to be human  
I would give my life, to be.  
  
Human I'm trying to come clean,  
I will be a better me,  
I will not drink until I'm dead  
I'll make the most of it.  
I don't know what it's like to be alive,  
To say goodbye,  
To cry a thousand tears  
Because my ears won't listen  
  
Human I'm trying not to lose my faith in you,  
I've sussed out all that I've seen through,  
I've sailed an ocean  
  
I am so scared of what I'll look like in the end  
For I am not prepared,  
I hope I will get the chance to be someone  
To be human,  
Look what we've done,  
Look what we've done  
  
I used to hear it all so loud,  
The sound of my heart breaking.  
The truth is waiting to be found,  
I trust that I will take it  
  
I would give my life,  
I would give my life,  
I would give my life,  
I would give my life,  
I would give my life, to be  
I would give my life, to be  
I would give my life, to be  
I would give my life, to be (human)

[Intro]  
I do what I love  
I do what I love and I love what I do  
  
[Verse 1]  
How many times do I need to  
Need to fight you baby  
Just to get that it's no good  
And I know that I'm strong  
But my mind's almost gone  
And it's getting on my mood  
And all this buzzing you been doing  
See you got me hanging up  
See you really got me worse  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
But I got to move on, baby  
Because bitches got to eat  
Got to get back to work  
I can't ask for your permission  
I can't wait for it  
Because I was born free  
I ain't taking shit  
  
[Chorus]  
I do what I love and I love what I do  
Stop me, stop me  
I'm stopping you  
Get the move right, baby, I'll show what I mean  
Don't stop me, stop me, I like how it feels  
I do what I love and I love what I do  
Stop me, stop me  
I'm stopping you  
Get the move right, baby, I'll show what I mean  
Don't stop me, stop me, I like how it feels  
  
[Verse 2]  
How many hits do you need for  
Me to get it in you  
Get it in you  
And I'm strong and my heart  
In my heart it won't change  
For anyone or anything  
And if you're crying about your lover  
Because your lover is a dick  
This will get you over it  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
But you got to move on, baby  
Because bitches got to eat  
Got to get back to work  
I can't ask for your permission  
I can't wait for it  
Because I was born free  
I ain't taking this  
  
[Chorus]  
I do what I love and I love what I do  
Stop me, stop me  
I'm stopping you  
Get the move right, baby, I'll show what I mean  
Don't stop me, stop me, I like how it feels  
  
[Bridge]  
I do what I love and I love what I do  
I do what I love and I love what I do  
Get move right baby, I'll show what I mean  
Get move right baby, I'll show what I mean  
  
[Chorus]  
I do what I love and I love what I do  
Stop me, stop me  
I'm stopping you  
Get the move right, baby, I'll show what I mean  
Don't stop me, stop me, I like how it feels  
I do what I love and I love what I do  
Stop me, stop me  
I'm stopping you  
Get the move right, baby, I'll show what I mean  
Don't stop me, stop me, I like how it feels  
  
[Outro]  
I do what I love and I love what I do

Clinging to me  
Like a last breath you would breathe  
You were like home to me  
I don't recognize the street  
  
Please don't close your eyes  
Don't know where to look without them  
Outside the cars speed by  
I never heard them until now  
  
I know you care, I know it is always been there  
But there is trouble ahead I can feel it  
You are just saving yourself when you hide it  
Yeah, I know you care  
I see it in the way that you stare  
As if there was trouble ahead, and you knew it  
I'll be saving myself from the ruin  
And I know you care  
  
I use to run down the stairs, to the door  
And I thought you were there  
To shape to the comfort of us  
Two lovers loved out of love  
  
Oh, but I know you care  
I know it is always been there  
But there is trouble ahead I can feel it  
You are just saving yourself when you hide it  
Yeah, I know you care  
I see it in the way that you stare  
As if there was trouble ahead, and you knew it  
I'll be saving myself from the ruin  
  
I know it wasn't always wrong  
But I've never known a winter so cold  
Now I don't want my hands in a coat  
But I still hope  
'Cause this is how things ought to have been  
And I know the worst of it wasn't all that it seemed  
Why can't I dream?  
Do I care to dream?  
  
'Cause I know you care  
And I know you care  
I know you care  
I know you care  
I know it's always been there

Breathe air you're not used to, tread floors you don't fall through  
Make waves  
You crash a symbol hard  
Follow no one, always play the wrong card  
Waste days, in foreign places  
Shed lights, on your better side  
Reassure me that you'll wait for me, wait for me as long as it takes!  
  
And I'll hold my breath, I'll hold my breath  
  
Until you see me in your dreams  
We'll stay awake beneath the trees  
We'll watch the buildings turn to dust  
A sky of diamonds just for us  
You are the risk I'll always take  
The only branch I'll never break  
Those fears we'll blow them all way  
  
Fight fires in your best clothes, touch skin with your eyes closed  
Chase thunder  
With the volume down  
Pack a suitcase, wonder to the next town  
Force quit, on your losing streak  
Solve a riddle in a magazine, be tongue in cheek  
Tell me that we're still too young, that we're still too young and I'll my
tongue  
  
Until you see me in your dreams  
We'll stay awake beneath the trees  
We'll watch the buildings turn to dust  
A sky of diamonds just for us  
You are the risk I'll always take  
The only branch I'll never break  
Those fears we'll blow them all way  
  
I'm here, I'm here to save you  
No fall, I will swim to save you  
  
Until you see me in your dreams  
We'll stay awake beneath the trees  
We'll watch the buildings turn to dust A sky of diamonds just for us  
You are the risk I'll always take  
The only branch I'll never break  
Those fears we'll blow them all way

Anything we should know about your change?  
Stood in the rain and watched you go  
I feel a lump in my throat  
And this is far from joy  
  
I never seemed to learn,  
That high makes things harder  
That high I get from you  
  
I've figured out that joy is not in your arms  
I know I'll always ache with an empty heart  
I think it's time to run 'cos I'm seeing stars  
I'm seeing stars, watch me fall apart  
  
I think of dying all the time  
But I've got joy to take my side  
Fear is my favorite ride  
  
I've figured out that joy is not in your arms  
I know I'll always ache with an empty heart  
I think it's time to run 'cos I'm seeing stars  
I'm seeing stars, watch me fall apart  
  
I've figured out that joy is not in your arms  
I know I'll always ache with an empty heart  
I think it's time to run 'cos I'm seeing stars  
I'm seeing stars, watch me fall apart

[Verse 1]  
People like to talk because they don't know what to say  
Running from the truth because the truth's too much to take  
I keep raising glasses cause I only got today  
I just keep moving, I just keep moving  
  
[Chorus]  
You can hurt me, I'll find another  
You can love me, you'll be my lover  
Happy, in rain or thunder  
Baby I keep  
I keep on, I keep on, I just keep on dancing  
I just keep on dancing  
I just keep on dancing  
  
[Verse 2]  
Can you see my, see my headlights  
You can come ride shotgun with me  
Whatever you like, ever you like  
Every time I look at those stars  
Know they ain't got the answers for me  
But I'll be alright, I'll be alright  
  
[Chorus]  
You can hurt me, I'll find another  
You can love me, you'll be my lover  
Happy, in rain or thunder  
Baby I keep  
I keep on, I keep on, I just keep on dancing  
I just keep on dancing  
I just keep on dancing  
You can hurt me, I'll find another  
You can love me, you'll be my lover  
I just keep on dancing

[Verse 1]  
Headlights flashing, cold eyes  
Know your bullets fly through the night  
Broken doors falling, and hotel floors  
I was never yours, never mine  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
All I said was "Hello, hello"  
You just stood and watched me cry to pass the time  
And all I said was "Hello, hello"  
Tell me how to say "goodbye," cause it's goodbye  
  
[Chorus]  
I can't stay on my knees  
Give me some mercy, please  
It's alright, let it die  
I wanted everything  
More than your love could give  
It's alright, let it die  
  
[Verse 2]  
See change whispers in the waves  
Watch my sorrows drown peacefully  
And empires crumble to the shores  
I was never yours, never mine  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
All I said was "Hello, hello"  
You just stood and watched me cry to pass the time  
And all I said was "Hello, hello"  
Tell me how to say "goodbye," cause it's goodbye  
  
[Chorus]  
I can't stay on my knees  
Give me some mercy, please  
It's alright, let it die  
I wanted everything  
More than your love could give  
It's alright, let it die  
  
[Chorus]  
I can't stay on my knees  
Give me some mercy, please  
It's alright, let it die  
I wanted everything  
More than your love could give  
It's alright, let it die  
I can't stay on my knees  
Give me some mercy, please  
It's alright, let it die  
I wanted everything  
More than your love could give  
It's alright, let it die

I had a way then  
Losing it all on my own  
I had a heart then  
But the queen has been overthrown  
And I'm not sleeping now  
The dark is too hard to beat  
And I'm not keeping up  
The strength I need to push me  
  
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone  
You shine them when I'm alone  
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong  
And dreaming when they're gone  
'Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home  
Calling, calling, calling home  
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone  
You shine them when I'm alone  
  
Noises, I play within my head  
Touch my own skin  
And hope they'll still be there  
And I think back to when  
My brother and my sister slept  
In another place  
The only time I feel safe  
  
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone  
You shine them when I'm alone  
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong  
And dreaming when they're gone  
'Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home  
Calling, calling, calling home  
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone  
You shine them when I'm alone  
  
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone  
You shine them when I'm alone  
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong  
Dreaming when they're gone  
'Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home  
Calling, calling, calling home  
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone  
You shine them when I'm alone  
  
Home, home  
Home, home

[Verse 1]  
You're the light, you're the night  
You're the color of my blood  
You're the cure, you're the pain  
You're the only thing I wanna touch  
Never knew that it could mean so much  
So much  
  
[Verse 2]  
You're the fear, I don't care  
Cause I've never been so high  
Follow me to the dark  
Let me take you past our satellites  
Then You can see the world you brought to life, to life  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So love me like you do, love love love me like you do  
Love me like you do, love love love me like you do  
Touch me like you do, touch touch touch me like you do  
What are you waiting for?  
  
[Verse 3]  
  
Fading in, fading out  
On the edge of paradise  
Every inch of your skin is a holy grail I've got to find  
Only you can set my heart on fire, on fire  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
  
Yeah, I'll let you set the pace  
Cause I'm not thinking straight  
My head spinning around I can't see clear no more  
What are you waiting for?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Love me like you do, love love love me like you do  
Love me like you do, love love love me like you do  
Touch me like you do, touch touch touch me like you do  
What are you waiting for?  
  
Love me like you do, love love love me like you do  
Love me like you do, love love love me like you do  
Touch me like you do,touch touch touch me like you do  
What are you waiting for?  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
  
I'll let you set the pace  
Cause I'm not thinking straight  
My head spinning around I can't see clear no more  
What are you waiting for?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Love me like you do, love love love me like you do  
Love me like you do, love love love me like you do  
Touch me like you do, touch touch touch me like you do  
What are you waiting for?  
  
Love me like you do, love love love me like you do  
Love me like you do, love love love me like you do  
Touch me like you do, touch touch touch me like you do  
What are you waiting for?

You say you're going through changes  
Every day it seems your life is up and down  
And you say that you're looking for an answer  
Everywhere you look it seems you can't be found  
  
Like searching, trying to find the rainbow  
No one's ever found it, yet it's told to be  
But if you're looking for a lover  
Everything you need, yeah, you can find right here with me  
  
I've got the Midas touch  
Everything I touch turns to gold, oh sugar  
I've got the Midas touch  
Baby, let me touch your body and your soul  
  
I've got the Midas touch  
Everything I touch turns to gold, oh sugar  
I've got the Midas touch  
Baby, let me touch your body and your soul  
  
Now you've been trapped by love  
Someone takes your heart and then says goodbye  
So you say that you'll never love another  
Tired of playing games and that's the reason why  
  
But now whenever we're together  
There's a certain feeling, that we both agree  
And it's time that you've opened up to love  
'Cause if you don't ever try, then baby, you may never see  
  
I've got the Midas Touch  
Everything I touch turns to gold, oh sugar  
I've got the Midas Touch  
Baby, let me touch your body and your soul  
  
I've got the Midas Touch  
Everything I touch turns to gold, oh sugar  
I've got the Midas Touch  
Baby, let me touch your body and your soul  
  
Together you and I we're meant to be  
I'll be right beside whenever you need me  
This love we have will never fade away  
You can count on me cause I'm here to stay, yeah  
  
I've got the Midas Touch  
Everything I touch turns to gold, oh sugar  
I've got the Midas Touch  
Baby, let me touch your body and your soul  
  
I've got the Midas Touch  
Everything I touch turns to gold, oh sugar  
I've got the Midas Touch  
Baby, let me touch your body and your soul

I am a mosaic  
That was found at  
The bottom of your garden  
I'm just wondering but the crack begin to show  
Look closely and then you'll know  
Then you'll know  
  
I am a beauty that once was  
Tell the country nothing something special  
But never out of your league of  
Battle with this twice now  
He came to me said  
"heres how"  
Spoke a single line  
And we dance in our scene  
I'll just die in your arms  
And my life is complete  
  
I am a mosaic  
That was found when you didn't know any better  
I am broken now (x3)  
And image that is scattered  
Around and (x5)  
A million ways I, I  
Didn't have to hurt (x3)  
Fought away this twice  
And now all we came to reason  
"heres how"  
Spoke a single line  
We danced in our scene  
I could just die in your arms and my life is complete  
  
Craddled your legs  
And took to your feet  
You're the strongest love  
I ever did meet  
Spoke a single line  
While we danced in our scene  
Just die in your arms and my life is complete

That feeling, that doesn't go away just did  
And I walked a thousand miles to prove it  
And I'm caught in the crossfire of my own thoughts  
The color of my blood is all I see on the rocks  
As you sail from me  
  
Alarms will ring for eternity  
The waves will break every chain on me  
My bones will bleach  
My flesh will flee  
So help my lifeless frame to breathe  
  
And God knows, I'm not dying but I breathe now  
And God knows, it's the only way to heal now  
With all the blood I lost with you  
It drowns the love I thought I knew  
  
The lost dreams are buried in my sleep for him  
And this was the ecstasy of a love forgotten  
And I'm thrown in the gunfire of empty bullets  
And my blood is all I see  
As you steal my soul from me  
  
Alarms will ring for eternity  
The waves will break every chain on me  
  
And God knows, I'm not dying but I breathe now  
And God knows, it's the only way to heal now  
With all the blood I lost with you  
It drowns the love I thought I knew  
  
And God knows, I'm not dying but I breathe now  
And God knows, it's the only way to heal now  
With all the blood I lost with you  
It drowns the love I thought I knew  
  
And God knows, I'm not dying but I breathe now  
And God knows, it's the only way to heal now  
With all the blood I lost with you  
It drowns the love I thought I knew

He jumps in a taxi, hands for the sky  
He's off to slay some demon or dragonfly  
He's lookin' at me, that long last time  
I'll turn away again and I wave goodbye  
In an envelope, inside his coat  
Is a chain I wore, around my throat  
Along with, a note I wrote  
Said "I love you but, I don't even know why"  
  
But darling, I wish you well  
On your way to the wishing well  
Swinging off those gates of hell  
And I can tell how hard you're trying  
And just have our secret hope  
Sometimes all we do is cope  
Somewhere on the steepest slope  
There'll be an endless rope  
And nobody's crying  
  
Well a couple of long nights turn into a- a couple long years  
Of me walkin' walkin' around, around this trail of tears  
Where the very loud voices of my own fears  
Is ringin' and ringin' in my ears  
It says that love is long gone  
Every move I make is all wrong  
Says you never gave a damn for me  
  
For anything, for anyone  
  
But darling, I wish you well  
On your way to the wishing well  
Swinging off those gates of hell  
And I can tell how hard you're trying,  
And just have our secret hope  
Sometimes all we do is cope  
Somewhere on the steepest slope  
There'll be an endless rope  
And nobody's crying  
  
May you dream you are sleepin', in a warm soft bed  
And may the voices inside you that fill you with dread  
Turn the sound of thousands of angels instead  
Tonight where you might be laying your head  
  
I wish you well  
On your way to the wishing well  
Swinging off of those gates of hell  
And I can tell how hard you're trying  
And Just have our secret hope  
Sometimes all I do is cope  
Somewhere on the steepest slope  
There'll be an endless rope  
And nobody's crying  
And nobody's crying

If I'm catching your eye  
It was an accident  
If I looked at you strange  
It's not what I meant  
I wanted to touch  
You're occupied  
I tried to explain but I'm tongue tied  
I'll wait in the wings again  
Until you find me out  
What is the hold up  
  
Oo oo oo  
I'm not following you  
Ooo oo oo  
Walking this way too  
Ooo oo oo  
I've had enough of dreaming  
All my dreams are you  
  
If I sat next to you  
That wasn't my intent  
And if my hand falls on yours  
It was coincidence  
I'll stay in the room until you're gone  
I'll switch to the chair that you sat on  
I'll sit there alone again  
Until you find me out  
What is the hold up  
  
Ooo oo oo  
I'm not following you  
Ooo oo oo  
Walking this way too  
Ooo oo oo  
See I've had enough of dreaming  
All my dreams are you  
  
I wish you would notice me  
If not now, eventually  
Then I wouldn't have to follow you around  
And hunt you down  
Hunt you down  
Hunt you down  
  
Promise we'll get along  
If you talk to me  
We'll tell eachother our stories imperfectly  
Imperfectly  
  
I wanted to touch  
You're occupied  
I tried to explain but I'm tongue tied  
I'll wait in the wings again  
Until you find me out  
See what is the hold up  
  
Ooo oo oo  
I'm not following you  
Ooo oo oo  
Walking this way too  
Ooo oo oo  
I've had enough of dreaming  
All my dreams are you

[Intro]  
Oh, oh  
Uh-oh-oh-oh  
Eh  
  
[Verse 1]  
It's a little blurry how the whole thing started  
I don't even really know what you intended  
Thought that you were cute and you could make me jealous  
Poured it down, so I poured it down  
Next thing that I know I'm in a hotel with you  
You were talking deep like it was mad love to you  
You wanted my heart but I just liked your tattoos  
Poured it down, so I poured it down  
  
[Pre-Chorus 1]  
And now I don't understand it  
You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth  
And I know I shouldn't say it  
But my heart don't understand  
  
[Chorus 1]  
Why I got you on my mind  
Why I got you on my mind  
Why I got you on my mind  
Why I got you on my mind  
But my heart don't understand  
Why I got you on my mind  
Why I got you on my mind  
Why I got you on my mind  
Why I got you on my mind  
  
[Verse 2]  
I always hear, always hear them talking  
Talking 'bout a girl, 'bout a girl with money  
Saying that I hurt you but I still don't get it  
You didn't love me, no, not really  
Wait  
I could have really liked you  
I'll bet, I'll bet that's why I keep on thinking 'bout you  
It's a shame (shame), you said I was good  
So I poured it down, so I poured it down  
  
[Pre-Chorus 1]  
And now I don't understand it  
You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth  
And I know I shouldn't say it  
But my heart don't understand  
  
[Chorus 2]  
Why I got you on my mind  
Why I got you on my mind  
Why I got you on my mind  
Why I got you on my mind  
But my heart don't understand  
Why I got you on my mind  
You think you know somebody  
Why I got you on my mind  
You think you know somebody  
Why I got you on my mind  
You think you know somebody  
Why I got you on my mi-i-i-i-ind  
  
[Bridge]  
You got yourself in a dangerous zone  
Cause we both have the fear, fear of being alone  
  
[Pre-Chorus 2]  
And I still don't understand it  
You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth  
And my heart don't understand it  
Understand it, understand it  
  
[Chorus 3]  
Why I got you on my mind  
You think you know somebody  
Why I got you on my mind  
You think you know somebody  
Why I got you on my mind  
You think you know somebody  
Why I got you on my mind  
But my heart don't understand  
Why I got you on my mind  
You think you know somebody  
Why I got you on my mind  
You think you know somebody  
Why I got you on my mind  
You think you know somebody  
Why I got you on my mind  
But my heart don't understand  
Why I got you on my mind  
You think you know somebody  
Why I got you on my mind  
You think you know somebody  
Why I got you on my mind  
You think you know somebody  
Why I got you on my mind  
  
[Outro]

Only you can be the aching in my heart  
My enemy, the only animal I couldn't fight  
You hold me in the dark when storms arrive, only you  
  
Only you can see the emptiness I feel  
When you're with me  
When everything you say I'm on my knees  
Baby I'm on my knees  
Baby I'm on my knees  
Baby I'm on my knees  
  
When everything you say I'm on my knees  
Baby I'm on my knees  
Baby I'm on my knees  
Baby I'm on my knees  
  
Only you can be the aching in my heart  
My enemy, the only animal I couldn't fight  
You hold me in the dark when storms arrive  
Only you  
Only you  
Only you  
Only you can see the emptiness I feel  
When you're with me  
When everything you say I'm on my knees  
Baby I'm on my knees  
Baby I'm on my knees  
Baby I'm on my knees  
  
When everything you say I'm on my knees  
Baby I'm on my knees  
Baby I'm on my knees  
Baby I'm on my knees, only you  
  
Only you can be the aching in my heart  
My enemy, the only animal I couldn't fight  
You hold me in the dark when storms arrive, only you  
  
Only you  
  
Only you can be the aching in my heart  
My enemy, the only animal I couldn't fight  
You hold me in the dark when storms arrive, only you

[Verse 1]  
I've been filling in the blanks  
You left me with your open hands  
I never knew what I had to do  
Stumbling out in the dark  
You left me with a question mark  
You said the bridges had to be burned  
  
[Refrain]  
And it's a pain that only we know  
Oh and you lost all on your own  
Always has to be a new scare  
To keep us falling over the edge  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
So, have another drink  
Have another drink, call me  
If this is what it takes  
If it's what it takes, baby  
Dream another dream  
Because you're killing it, honey  
This is what we do to get by  
  
[Chorus]  
We're always chasing that paradise  
Paradise, paradise, paradise  
  
[Verse 2]  
There's a place we try to reach  
Impossible as it would seem  
I heard you crying out in your sleep  
I see that look you save for me  
I pull you back upon your feet  
I know you always need something more, more  
  
[Refrain]  
And it's a thing that only we know  
Oh and you lost all on your own  
Always has to be a new scare  
To keep us falling over the edge  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
So, have another drink  
Have another drink, call me  
If this is what it takes  
If it's what it takes, baby  
Dream another dream  
Because you're killing it, honey  
This is what we do to get by  
  
[Chorus]  
We're always chasing that paradise, paradise  
We're always chasing that paradise, paradise  
  
[Bridge]  
I know we're headed for a moment, baby  
We made sense of it  
I know I struck you so reckless, honey  
We gave into it  
I know we're headed for a moment, baby  
We made sense of it  
I know I struck you so reckless, honey  
We gave in  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
So, have another drink  
Have another drink, call me  
If this is what it takes  
If it's what it takes, baby  
Dream another dream  
Because you're killing it, honey  
This is what we do to get by  
  
[Chorus]  
We're always chasing that paradise, paradise  
We're always chasing that paradise, paradise

You're sharp as a knife and you fit like a glove  
That is no way to live that is no way to love  
Full of fear in your skin and the weakness in giving in  
Your stabbed in the back but you feel no pain  
Push the heaviest doors that you can't open  
Yeah they tied me up and my body lies still, again  
  
You're as bright as the sun and as calm as the wind  
I don't know when you'll break but it's gonna be soon  
If my will caves in, I'll be in the same boat as you  
  
I've got the salt skin  
Running to where he is  
Never going to give in  
Even with the strength  
He's stealing salt skin  
Telling me I'm winning  
Wars they created  
Just to understand  
The meaning (of)  
  
Hands on strings and my mouth open  
Find the perfect words that I've not spoken  
And I won't tell the truth unless you want me to  
  
For all of the times that I lost my head  
When it rolled to the floor and I found it again  
But when it came back,  
I didn't know my own name  
  
I've got the salt skin  
Running to where he is  
Never going to give in  
Even with the strength  
He's stealing salt skin  
Telling me I'm winning  
Wars they created  
Just to understand  
The meaning (of)  
Of, of  
  
I've got the salt skin  
Running to where he is  
Never going to give in  
Even with the strength  
He's stealing salt skin  
Telling me I'm winning  
Wars they created  
Just to understand  
  
I've got the salt skin  
Running to where he is  
Never going to give in  
Even with the strength  
He's stealing salt skin  
Telling me I'm winning  
Wars they created  
Just to understand  
The meaning (of)

[Verse 1]  
I think I'll let fate just take me home  
Because over pain, love is outgrown  
I've never won a fight to understand  
I just move as my heart commands  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I've always had a thing for silence  
But lately I just need a voice I recognise  
Baby, it's perfect timing now to...  
  
[Chorus]  
Scream it out, out  
I won't let you down, down  
So scream it out, out  
I won't let you down, down  
  
[Verse 2]  
Have you found peace with your mistakes?  
Breathing on the glass as it breaks  
Have you found the words to save her  
And keep your heart out of danger?  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I've always had a thing for silence  
But lately I just need a voice I recognise  
Baby, it's perfect timing now to....  
  
[Chorus]  
Scream it out, out  
I won't let you down, down  
So scream it out, out  
I won't let you down, down  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I've always had a thing for silence  
But lately I just need a voice I recognise  
Baby, it's perfect timing now to...  
  
[Chorus]  
Scream it out, out  
I won't let you down, down  
So scream it out, out  
I won't let you down, down

And you said  
It was like fire around the brim  
Burning solid  
Burning thin the burning rim  
Like stars burning holes right through the dark  
Flicking fire like saltwater in my eyes  
You were one inch from the edge of this bed  
I drag you back a sleepyhead, sleepyhead  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
They couldn't think of something to say the day you burst  
With all their lions and all their might and all their thirst  
They crowd your bedroom like some thoughts wearing thin  
Against the walls against your rules against your skin  
My beard grew down to the floor and out the doors  
Of your eyes but go in disguise like a sleepyhead, sleepyhead  
  
[Instrumental]

Oh, oh, starry eyed (starry)  
Starry eyed  
  
Hit, hit, hit, hit, hit me with lightning  
Handle bars, and then I let go, let go for anyone  
Take me in, and throw out my heart and get a new one  
  
Next thing we're touching  
You look at me it's like you hit me with lightning  
Ah  
  
Oh, everybody's starry eyed  
And everybody goes  
Oh, everybody's starry eyed  
And my body goes  
Whoa oh oh ah ah  
Whoa oh oh ah ah  
Whoa oh oh  
  
So we burst into colors, colors and carousels  
Fall head first like paper planes in playground games  
  
Next thing we're touching  
You look at me it's like you hit me with lightning  
Ah  
  
Oh, everybody's starry eyed  
And everybody goes  
Oh, everybody's starry eyed  
And my body goes  
Whoa oh oh ah ah  
Whoa oh oh ah ah  
Whoa oh oh  
  
Next thing we're touching  
Next thing we're touching  
Next thing we're touching  
Next thing we're touching  
Next thing we're touching  
Next thing we're touching  
Next thing we're touching  
Next thing we're touching  
  
Hit me with lightning  
Oh, everybody's starry eyed  
And everybody goes  
Oh, everybody's starry eyed  
And my body goes oh  
Oh, everybody's starry eyed  
And everybody goes  
Oh, everybody's starry eyed  
And my body goes  
Whoa oh oh ah ah  
Whoa oh oh ah ah  
(And my body goes)  
Whoa oh oh ah ah

Take my faith in your hands, we have a lot that hasn't near begun  
Something is calling us, we're breaking free  
I'm curious, I need to see  
  
Like a flash before our eyes, rolling to the night  
And if it feels like you're dreaming  
Believe it, believe it  
  
We'll have to wait to the morning  
The sun will never go down  
And we'll be this way forever  
I guarantee you that  
Just stay awake, stay awake  
You can feel it just the way it goes  
Just stay awake, stay awake  
  
Bring me down, side by side  
While our reflections pick up all this collide  
So full of energy, nothing to hide  
No need to sleep, we come alive  
  
And if we're gonna take this right  
We can go wherever we like  
And if it feels like you're dreaming  
Believe it, believe it  
  
We'll have to wait to the morning  
The sun will never go down  
And we'll be this way forever  
I guarantee you that  
Just stay awake, stay awake  
You can feel it just the way it goes  
Just stay awake, stay awake  
  
Believe it  
  
Take my faith in your hands, we have a lot that hasn't near begun  
Something is calling us, we're breaking free  
I'm curious, I need to see  
  
Our dreams was lower than this  
I flash before our dreams  
  
Like a flash before our eyes, running through the night  
And if it feels like you're dreaming  
Believe it, believe it  
  
We'll have to wait to the morning  
The sun will never go down  
And we'll be this way forever  
I guarantee you that  
Just stay awake, stay awake  
You can feel it just the way it goes  
Just stay awake, stay awake

[Verse 1]  
Just you and me  
That true love, it was taken away from us so young  
We're summer kids  
Without a song, we're fading in to oblivion  
But we're still the one  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
We got our guard up and we're hung up on another loss  
I need to summon all these demons keeping me on the floor  
But now we're here and I am giving everything to you  
Just say you need this, say you need me, say you want this too  
  
[Chorus]  
Say you want this too  
Say you need this too  
We're the greatest  
Gets it like we do  
Kills it like we do  
We're the greatest  
No one does it like we do  
  
[Verse 2]  
That sadness kills  
Don't let the past dictate the way you play it now  
Don't play it down  
The time is now  
I know you're feeling what I feel, just let it show  
Don't let it go  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Somebody somewhere driving in their car is crying out  
Forever running from the truth, sometimes all we have is doubt  
But now we're here and I am giving all I can to you  
Just say you love me, say you love me, say you want this too  
  
[Chorus]  
Say you want this too  
Say you need this too  
We're the greatest  
Gets it like we do  
Kills it like we do  
We're the greatest  
No one does it like we do  
No one does it like we do  
No one does it like we do  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Somebody somewhere driving in their car is crying out  
Forever running from the truth, sometimes all we have is doubt  
But now we're here and I am giving all I can to you  
Just say you love me, say you love me, say you want this too  
  
[Chorus]  
Say you want this too  
Say you need this too  
We're the greatest  
Gets it like we do  
Kills it like we do  
We're the greatest  
No one does it like we do  
Say you want this too  
Say you need this too  
We're the greatest  
Gets it like we do  
Kills it like we do  
We're the greatest  
No one does it like we do

Where's that diamond ring you promised?  
My fingers looking bare  
Where's that valentine, be honest,  
The postman didn't bring it here  
The thing I wasn't looking for  
I found in your bedroom drawer  
The letter that you loved her better,  
Made me want you even, more  
  
And too much love's not good for you  
Your heart can get too full  
And too much love's an iou  
And if I give you that, you'll  
Send me the blues.  
  
Ooohhhh, yeah  
  
Where is all that time you promised?  
The first hand's on the three  
Where's the second hand, I'm bothered  
To see it stroking on her knee  
The thing I wasn't looking for  
I found in your bedroom drawer  
The letter that you loved her better,  
Made me want you even, more  
  
Chorus

I'll never forget that feeling,  
When I watched you disappear,  
And you made me stop believing,  
I could fight away the fear.  
  
Now the smoke has cleared and the end is near,  
It was my illusion.  
Like a broken dream, I was incomplete,  
But your love was never the missing key.  
  
I feel like I'm breathing again,  
I feel like I'm seeing again,  
I feel like I'm breathing again,  
I got it under control, oh, oh,  
I got it under control, oh, oh,  
I got it under control, oh, oh.  
  
All that's real is faded,  
Like a car into the night.  
Like a painkiller, I take it,  
And I watch the world ignite.  
  
Now the smoke has cleared and the end is near,  
It was my illusion.  
Like a broken dream, I was incomplete,  
But your love was never the missing key.  
  
I feel like I'm breathing again,  
I feel like I'm seeing again,  
I feel like I'm breathing again,  
I got it under control, oh, oh,  
I got it under control, oh, oh,  
I got it under control, oh, oh,  
I got it under control, oh, oh.  
  
I got it under control.  
I got it under control.  
  
I got it under control, oh, oh,  
I got it under control, oh, oh,  
I got it under control, oh, oh.  
  
I feel like I'm breathing again,  
I feel like I'm seeing again,  
I feel like I'm breathing again,  
I got it under control, oh, oh,  
I got it under control, oh, oh,  
I got it under control, oh, oh,  
I got it under control, oh, oh.  
  
I got it under control, oh, oh,  
I got it under control, oh, oh,  
I got it under control, oh, oh,  
I got it under control, oh, oh.  
  
I got it under control.  
I got it under control.

Like all the boys before  
Like all the boys boys boys boys  
Like all the boys before  
Like all the boys boys boys boys  
  
You left a blood stain on the floor  
You set your sights on him  
You left a hand print on the door  
Like all the boys before, like all the boys before  
  
This is our luck baby, running out  
Our clothes were never off  
We still have our roads to run about  
To scale the map, scale the map, to get us back on track  
I've seen you in a fight you lost  
I've seen you in a fight  
  
We're under the sheets and you're killing me  
In our house made of paper, your words all over me  
We're under the sheets and you're killing me  
  
Like all the boys before  
Like all the boys boys boys boys  
Like all the boys before  
Like all the boys boys boys boys  
  
In here the world won't bring us down  
Our plan is gold dust  
Out there a lonely girl could drown  
In here we're frozen  
  
Where did the people go?  
My hands are empty  
You're not the answer I should know  
Like all the boys before, like all the boys before  
  
We're under the sheets and you're killing me  
In our house made of paper, your words all over me  
We're under the sheets and you're killing me  
  
We're in a mess baby, we're in a mess babe  
Your more is less babe, oh  
We're in a mess baby, we're in a mess babe  
Your more is less babe, oh oh  
  
We're under the sheets and you're killing me  
In our house made of paper and your words all over me  
We're under the sheets and you're killing me  
(I've seen you in a fight you lost)  
Like all the boys before, like all the boys before  
  
We're under the sheets and you're killing me  
In our house made of paper, your words all over me  
We're under the sheets and you're killing me  
  
We're under the sheets and you're killing me  
In our house made of paper, your words all over me  
We're under the sheets and you're killing me  
Killing, killing, killing me  
Killing, killing, killing me

[Verse 1]  
Used to roll in perfect motion, easy  
Lips like Tanqueray  
Tropical sunrises, never sleeping  
I don't know what changed  
All I want to do is feel the rhythm of the night  
You've been running from the dark  
You can't look me in the eyes  
Being called into the heat  
Even if it's burning me  
I just need to dance without you  
  
[Chorus]  
We can't move to this  
We can't even talk, boy  
We don't even kiss  
It never works  
We can't move to this  
We can't even talk, boy  
We don't even kiss  
You're not in love  
We can't move to this  
We can't even talk, boy  
We don't even kiss  
It never works  
We can't move to this  
We can't even talk, boy  
We don't even kiss  
  
[Verse 2]  
Through the streets and all the places I've been  
I can see we never had harmony  
I won't go even though I'm alone and I know I want out  
I go up without you bringing me down  
Such a rush  
So now I'm staying to dance on my own  
On my own  
And all I know is  
  
[Chorus]  
We can't move to this  
We can't even talk, boy  
We don't even kiss  
It never works  
We can't move to this  
We can't even talk, boy  
We don't even kiss  
You're not in love  
We can't move to this  
We can't even talk, boy  
We don't even kiss  
It never works  
We can't move to this  
We can't even talk, boy  
We don't even kiss  
You're not in love  
  
[Bridge]  
Now I'm giving you up tonight  
Now I'm giving you up tonight  
And I'm dancing on my own because  
We can't move together  
Now I'm giving you up tonight  
Now I'm giving you up tonight  
And I'm dancing on my own because  
We can't move together  
Now I'm giving you up tonight  
Now I'm giving you up tonight  
And I'm dancing on my own because  
We can't move together  
Now I'm giving you up tonight  
Now I'm giving you up tonight  
And I'm dancing on my own because  
We can't move to  
  
[Chorus]  
We can't move to this  
We can't even talk, boy  
We don't even kiss  
It never works  
We can't move to this  
We can't even talk, boy  
We don't even kiss  
And all I know is  
We can't move to this  
We can't even talk, boy  
We don't even kiss  
It never works  
We can't move to this  
We can't even talk, boy  
We don't even kiss  
I'm not in love

Suddenly we were friends,  
Guarding our country from traitors and new trends,  
You are at the borders,  
I am at the beaches examining exactly what the enemy teaches,  
Like presidents and pilots,  
We turned our blind eye to letters over our heads, floating in the sky,  
Thousands of paper animals signalling danger,  
They are evolving, and the world's a stranger,  
  
No currency to drive us crazy,  
No vehicles would drive us and make us lazy,  
To make us lazy,  
Only time my fall is when I fear, only time may notice I disappear,  
And I can't go back without a counter attack, and I can't turn around,  
It's my mother's pride,  
  
So close to somewhere else but we're not going there,  
We scan the forest floors,  
Looking worse for wear,  
For life outside of ours,  
Because we are too shallow and too brave to hide our scars and step in  
One's shadow,  
I am protective over you and the stories we enact,  
Gain what from the smallest of contact,  
  
No currency to drive us crazy,  
No vehicles to drive us and make us lazy, to make us lazy,  
Only time I fall is when I fear, only time may notice I disappear,  
And when I see her, when I see her... Everyday,  
  
Only time my fall is when I fear, only time may notice I disappear, and  
When I see her, when I see her everyday.

When did life become so complicated?  
Years of too much thought and time I wasted  
And in each line upon my face  
Is proof I fought and lived another day  
  
When did life become this place of madness?  
Drifting on an empty sea of waves and sadness?  
I make believe I'm in control  
And dream it wasn't all my fault  
  
When your feet don't touch the ground  
When your voice won't make a sound  
Here, it's safe, in this place, up off the clouds  
  
When your feet don't touch the earth  
You can't feel the fates that hurt  
And you're free, there's no need to come down  
When your feet don't touch the ground  
  
Everyday just feels a little longer  
Why am I the only one not getting stronger?  
Running around pretending life's a play  
It doesn't make the darkness go away  
  
I may be young but I can still remember  
Feeling full of joy, crying tears of laughter  
Now all my tears are all cried out  
Make-believe, but count me out  
  
Cause my feet are on the ground  
And the inner voice I found  
Tells the truth, "There's no use  
If your head's in the clouds"  
  
With my feet on solid earth  
I can face the fates that hurt  
And in time, I'll be fine  
I'll come 'round  
  
I was once like you  
Life was a maze  
I couldn't find my way out  
But what I say is true  
You will be amazed  
Make-believe and you will find out that it's true  
  
When your feet don't touch the ground  
When your voice won't make a sound  
Here, it's safe. In this place  
Up off the clouds  
When your feet don't touch the earth  
You can't feel the fates that hurt  
And you're free, there's no need, to come down  
When your feet don't touch the ground

[Who, who'd want to find love,  
It's not as if we know what to look for  
Looking out but not sure.  
Who, who'd want to find love,  
Maybe 'cause it's not come around yet  
Still I really don't care.  
Who, who'd want to find love,  
Don't worry 'cause your drink isn't drunk  
So better let the rest go]  
She's a lover with a chemical heart,  
Only ever talks about the obvious part.  
The place was empty not it's body heat heart  
Only hear a few words telling me what it felt like  
In the morning she's as good as unaffected.  
But her face moves less than it out to  
And everyone's just gone quiet.  
Only in it for the postcard picture,  
Only in it for the smoke of the gun.  
[Chorus]  
I'm not worried if the look doesn't last  
And there's something in the kiss  
I don't need to see past  
There's a speech bubble on the top of my head  
That everyone sees no matter what I just said I  
Think about it... too much...  
Talk about it... too much...  
Cry about it.. too much...  
Too much we're spinning in circles  
Only in it for the postcard picture  
Only in it for the smoke of the gun.  
[Chorus]  
So better let the rest go.
