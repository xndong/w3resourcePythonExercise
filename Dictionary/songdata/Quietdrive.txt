I'm falling into words I never knew,  
I never meant to say the words, "I love you"  
But it's in my heart and it feels new  
Is it true for you, is it true for you?  
  
Of course you'd like to play that we'd be friends,  
It couldn't stay that way 'cause we'd pretend,  
But then I heard about your new boyfriend  
Where did I go wrong, where did I go wrong?  
  
I'm sorry I forgot your birthday,  
I'm sorry 'cause I'm a shit face  
I thought it was on a Wednesday,  
A Monday or a Tuesday,  
It's all the same to me  
So what will make you happy?  
Tell me 'cause I'm sorry  
These colors that we find  
Look all the same to me  
  
I know that you've been hurt but in the end,  
I'd like to say it's worth all the things that we did  
But now you've found me out, my inside's dead  
What I have done wrong, what I have done wrong?  
  
I'm sorry I forgot your birthday,  
I'm sorry 'cause I'm a shit face  
I thought it was on a Wednesday,  
A Monday or a Tuesday,  
It's all the same to me  
So what will make you happy?  
Tell me 'cause I'm sorry  
These colors that we find  
Look all the same to me  
  
I couldn't take those things away from you  
I've made mistakes, but so have you  
We could have made it work but we lost  
When you left and you didn't have to,  
You didn't have to, didn't have to  
  
I'm sorry I forgot your birthday,  
I thought it was on a Wednesday  
What did all your friends say?  
They're all the same to me  
So what would make you happy?  
Tell me 'cause I'm sorry  
These days, they go by  
Feel all the same to me  
Feel all the same to me  
Feel all the same to me  
Feel all the same to me  
Feel all the same to me

Be honest with me  
Did you ever think  
That these things that you did  
Would come back to haunt you  
And fail you again  
Don't ever question  
My will to admit  
That when we're alone  
It's too hard to resist  
Making believe  
That we're bigger than this  
For choosing a road  
That is different but similar  
To the same one I took before  
  
Why don't we breathe  
Why can't you see  
That things aren't always  
What they appear to be  
And as simple as it sounds  
I think I've found  
The perfect way to grow old  
  
The simpleness describes  
The iron that is you  
And your rusty old life  
Get on with the mattress  
And tell-tale lies  
Watch everything  
That you touch turns to ice  
Following the sheep  
And they're at it again  
Making believe  
That there're free as it seems  
But only finding out that  
They're on a sinking ship  
That doesn't care  
How many it saves today  
  
Why don't we breathe  
Why can't you see  
That things aren't always  
What they appear to be  
And as simple as it sounds  
I think I've found  
The perfect way to grow old  
  
Watch out now  
I see the light  
At the end of the tunnel  
It seems realistic  
That getting there will make us fine  
But watch out now  
It's full of glass  
Don't take the chance  
You'll surely pass  
At least some day  
We'll know the reason  
Why  
  
Why don't we breathe  
Why can't you see  
That things aren't always  
What they appear to be  
And as simple as it sounds  
I think I've found  
The perfect way to grow old  
  
The perfect way  
The perfect way

Anything goes on in your trip  
Did you happen to plan on selling out  
All your fake and original riffs  
Did you happen to think  
That they're true  
And it's all  
That I have  
And I feel  
Like I'm busting  
My ass  
  
[Chorus:]  
Is there anybody?  
(True that it's gone)  
Can't someone stop me?  
(It's taking too long)  
It's running through my body  
(Finding a sound)  
And we're sitting on it  
(Just get off the ground)  
Can you feel it, honey  
(Coming around)  
Yeah, I've  
Been there before  
  
How did I start off with this gig  
Did I think I would make some money, yeah  
Getting away with all this shit  
Some people might even think  
That it's me  
On the drums  
On the bass  
Filling in  
My guitar  
In your face  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Is there anybody?  
(Taking my time)  
Can't someone stop me?  
(Reading the signs)  
It's running through my body  
(Driving to go)  
And we're sitting on it  
(With all that we know)  
Can you feel it, honey  
(We're coming around)  
Yeah, I've  
Been there before  
  
And didn't you say it'd make you happy?  
Well are you happier right now?  
Why do we sing to make you happy?  
Well are you happier right now?  
'Cause didn't you say?  
Didn't you say?  
Didn't you say?  
Didn't you say?  
Didn't you say?  
It'd make you happy?  
  
[Chorus]

(by Hoobastank)  
  
I will dedicate  
And sacrifice my everything  
For just a second's worth  
Of my story's ending  
I'll be willing to  
Never come in suddenly  
Will I ever get to see  
The ending to my story  
  
Chorus  
Show me what it's for  
Make me understand it  
'Cause I've been crawling in the dark  
Looking for the answer  
Is there something more  
Than what I've been handed?  
'Cause I've been crawling in the dark  
Looking for the answer  
  
You carry on  
Show me  
It's ok to  
Use my heart and not my eyes  
To navigate the darkness  
Will the ending be  
Ever coming suddenly?  
Will I ever get to see  
The ending to my story?  
  
Chorus  
  
So when and how will I know?  
How much further will I have to go? (have to go)  
How much longer 'til I finally know? (finally know)  
Because I'm looking and I just can't see  
What's in front of me  
In front of me  
  
Chorus

I'm thinking back two, three years ago  
Thought of making you go eat  
Those words you said  
To me, to me, to me  
  
Watch you undress  
You're hysterical  
I might be giving you the money  
But today  
Forgive me  
  
Daddy's little girl  
Doesn't like the way I talk  
She's a spoiled little girl  
Gonna have to cut her off  
Because that's the way it goes  
With a spoiled little girl  
I don't know when love is real  
Daddy's little girl  
She's so nasty in the sack  
She's a crazy little girl  
Gonna have it coming back  
Because that's the way it goes  
With a spoiled little girl  
I don't know why love is not enough  
  
I wish that I was invisible  
Maybe then you'd never see me run away  
And I must confess  
I feel terrible  
But let's not listen to  
Those voices inside of me  
  
Daddy's little girl  
Doesn't like the way I talk  
She's a spoiled little girl  
Gonna have to cut her off  
Because that's the way it goes  
With a spoiled little girl  
I don't know when love is real  
Daddy's little girl  
She's so nasty in the sack  
She's a crazy little girl  
Gonna have it coming back  
Because that's the way it goes  
With a spoiled little girl  
I don't know why love is not enough  
  
A poster child of what we are  
Your hand, your keys  
Your brand new car  
The love we share, the melody  
The life you lead  
Daddy's little girl  
  
Daddy's little girl  
Doesn't like the way I talk  
She's a spoiled little girl  
Gonna have to cut her off  
Because that's the way it goes  
With a spoiled little girl  
I don't know when love is real  
Daddy's little girl  
She's so nasty in the sack  
She's a crazy little girl  
Gonna have it coming back  
Because that's the way it goes  
With a spoiled little girl  
I don't know why love is not enough  
  
Daddy's little girl  
Throwing money all around  
You had everything, girl  
I hope I never see your face around this town

Make believe  
If you're sick of everything  
All the time before us  
Doesn't taint my memory  
  
When the walls they put around us  
Can't stop what we believe  
When the love we share forgets us  
This dream will set us free  
  
(So please don't tell me)  
Deliver me, deliver me  
(So please don't tell me)  
If it's up to me, if it's up to me  
I've had it once and now I want it again  
(I've had it once and now I want it again)  
I've had it once and now I want it again  
(I've had it once and now I want it again)  
  
When the walls they put around us  
Can't stop what we believe  
When the love we share forgets us  
This dream will set us free  
  
(So please don't tell me)  
Deliver me, deliver me  
(So please don't tell me)  
If it's up to me, if it's up to me  
I've had it once and now I want it again  
(I've had it once and now I want it again)  
I've had it once and now I want it again  
(I've had it once and now I want it again)  
  
When the walls they put around us  
Can't stop what we believe  
When the love we share forgets us  
This dream will set us free  
  
(So please don't tell me)  
Deliver me, deliver me  
(So please don't tell me)  
If it's up to me, if it's up to me  
I've had it once and now I want it again  
(I've had it once and now I want it again)  
I've had it once and now I want it again  
(I've had it once and now I want it again)

[Chorus:]  
Do you know  
How I feel  
When you change your mind?  
Make me see  
What they said  
Would come true in time?  
Too late now  
I won't wait  
Wish I'd take it back  
So far you're not the same anymore  
  
Here's a tip, I'll make it easy  
No more you or I'll go crazy  
Stop - you made it lazy  
No it doesn't phase me  
I don't want to be your running mate  
I don't want to be with you anyway  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
It doesn't register as clearly  
As you thought I'd make it easy  
Pushing time and pressing feelings  
I don't know what you've been hearing.  
I don't want to be your running mate  
I don't want to be with you anyway  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Do you know  
How I feel  
When you put your hands  
On down to the small  
Of my back  
Do you know (Do you know)  
Do you know how it feels  
When you put your heart  
In the scar in the floor  
Do you know (Do you know)  
Do you know (Do you know)  
Do you know  
Do you know  
Do you know  
  
[Chorus:]

I never said no  
I never said yes  
But now there's something  
I need to get off my chest  
It's a lot for me.  
It's a lot for you.  
I never could sound  
The way that I feel  
But now it doesn't matter  
'Cuz this truth isn't real  
Are you fake to me  
Am I fake to me  
  
[Chorus:]  
I wanted  
To be there  
Never taking time to  
Understand your reasons for this  
Take the time to talk it over  
This is what you're listening for  
Patiently  
You wait for me  
Never wanted any sympathy  
For what you did to me  
I hopefully will  
Be set free  
  
You never said no  
You never said yes  
But now there's something you  
Need to confess to me willingly  
Are we history?  
I never rewind  
I never press play  
But I know that  
I've seen it all too many  
Times for me  
It's our history  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Everyone is holding me back  
From my place, am I displaced?  
Because I couldn't see that  
Everyone is wasting my time  
And I will not wait for you  
Because that day will come when  
  
Everyone and everything is  
Pulling me out of my brain  
Everyone and everything is  
Pulling me out of my brain  
Maybe I should try and stay with you.  
Everyone and everything is (No matter what you say)  
Pulling me out of my brain (No matter what you say)  
Maybe I should try and stay with you (No matter what you say)

Sometimes it's not that time  
For things I cannot hear  
For words I cannot feel  
The way you want to go  
It makes me feel like shit  
I'm messed but that's not it  
I wonder if she'll care  
For me ever again  
Waiting for the last time  
I'm waiting for the right time  
To see if she will know the things  
She doesn't say to me  
  
And I feel the way I feel  
Because I need you all the time  
And I know the things you know  
But that's just not enough to make it mine  
And I won't do anything that it might  
Compromise this time  
So I'll just sit and hold my breath  
Only that's not enough to make you mine  
  
Get up it's time to die  
Just guess and don't ask why  
Be late and just don't try  
Someday we will fly  
Higher than the satellites  
Into a spacial paradise  
Where up is up and down is down  
And no one is around  
(I don't want to see you crying)  
(Let's leave)  
(The dramatics behind)  
  
And I feel the way I feel  
Because I need you all the time  
And I know the things you know  
But that's just not enough to make it mine  
And I won't do anything that it might  
Compromise this time  
So I'll just sit and hold my breath  
Only that's not enough to make you mine  
  
To make you mine  
To make you mine

I lie awake  
Because I'm scared  
I'm not as fake  
As you once heard  
As you once heard  
  
I just want to go somewhere  
And hold you in my arms  
I just want to go somewhere  
To sort things on my own  
  
But it's following  
A dream  
That reminds me  
To believe it when I say  
  
I lie awake  
Because I'm scared  
I'm not as fake  
As you once heard  
But we'll lay down now  
Making sure we put these words  
Between us  
  
Maybe I can go somewhere  
And be the only one  
Maybe I can make you think  
That I'm the only one  
That's left to say  
That I was wrong  
That you've been right  
About everything all along  
  
I lie awake  
Because I'm scared  
I'm not as fake  
As you once heard  
But we'll lay down now  
Making sure we  
Put these words between us  
Don't put these words  
Between us  
  
I lie awake  
Because I'm scared  
I lie awake  
Because I'm scared  
I'm not as fake  
As you once heard  
But we'll lay down  
We'll lay down  
Before we come  
To regret our fate  
And I'll push them down  
And I'll push them down  
On the floor between us  
  
I lie awake  
Because I'm scared  
I'm not as fake  
As you once heard  
And we'll lay these words  
And we'll put them down  
On the floor between us  
Don't put these words between us  
Don't put these words between us

I never really thought I'd want to know  
I never thought I'd end this stand, but you know  
It's hard for me to just ignore  
Oh, it's just a matter of time  
Before I take your phone and I'll call everyone you know  
So hate me for letting go  
But you'll leave me if I try to stay  
  
Oh, give it up, give it up, Jessica  
Oh, won't you just let me go?  
All the secrets you keep  
And the words that you speak  
Mean more to me than you'll know  
Oh, give it up, give it up, Jessica  
Oh, won't you just let me go?  
All the secrets you keep inside  
Mean more to me  
They mean more to me than you'll know  
  
Are you living a lie, or are you living away?  
Does he know he is only just a place to stay?  
So let's just stop and rewind  
Before I lose my mind  
Before I don't wanna hear you say  
It's the worst of our types that go  
The worst who stay  
  
Oh, give it up, give it up, Jessica  
Oh, won't you just let me go?  
All the secrets you keep  
And the words that you speak  
Mean more to me than you'll know  
Oh, give it up, give it up, Jessica  
Oh, won't you just let me go?  
All the secrets you keep inside  
Mean more to me  
They mean more to me than you'll know  
  
You tear apart my mind  
And make me wonder where you are  
But I still remember everything  
That happened before dawn  
I'm begging you for honesty  
And all you're spitting out are lies  
Do you even have an alibi?  
I don't know, I don't know  
  
(Oh, give it up, give it up, Jessica)  
(Oh, give it up, give it up, Jessica)  
  
Oh, give it up, give it up, Jessica  
Oh, won't you just let me go?  
All the secrets you keep inside  
Mean to more to me  
They mean more to me than you'll know  
Oh, give it up, give it up, Jessica  
Oh, give it up, give it up for Jessica  
All the secrets you keep  
And the words that you speak  
Mean more to me  
You mean more to me than you'll know  
More to me  
You mean more to me than you'll know

The way I feel when I'm in doubt  
Is the way I feel when I'm without  
The way you kiss when we're alone  
The way you won't pick up your phone  
  
But she works on that garden alone like her father  
All day long, all day long  
And I think that she's thinking of me but you know I may be wrong, I may be
wrong  
  
It's only just my heart  
It's only just my veins  
You've been swimming in so long  
Slowly killing all this pain  
  
Don't you know I like the way she makes me laugh out loud  
The way she makes me think about  
The perfect way to turn her on  
The way that I slip off her tongue  
  
But she works on that garden alone like her father  
All day long, all day long  
And I think that she's thinking of me but you know  
I may be wrong, I may be wrong  
  
It's only just my heart  
It's only just my veins  
You've been swimming in so long  
Slowly killing all this pain  
But it's only just the sun  
That takes away the rain  
Suddenly I'm not as sad as yesterday  
What's left to say when you've said all you've said  
Take down the picture by my bed  
What's left to bleed when you've bled all you've bled  
I keep on thinking about  
  
The way I feel when I'm out of luck  
The way that I can't live without you  
  
What's left to take when you have nothing left  
You took all the best  
  
It's only just my heart  
It's only just my veins  
You've been swimming in so long  
Slowly killing all this pain  
But it's only just the sun  
That takes away the rain  
Suddenly I'm not as mad  
Suddenly I'm not as bad  
  
Suddenly I'm not as sad as yesterday  
Suddenly I'm not as sad as yesterday

A little piece in my life  
Is all I need to get me by  
But of course  
One or two more things  
Would make me satisfied  
  
But right about now  
I'm sitting down  
With a girl who think she's found  
Something more  
I don't know  
A little sister can't be sure  
(Listen)  
  
I just like kissing your lips  
My darling girl  
I know that's not what love is  
So why can't I  
Keep mine and you keep yours?  
So we both know  
What we're still waiting for  
  
Just one more week  
Go back home  
Suburban life can't be that bored  
Take your pills  
Wash them down  
With some coffee and some crowns  
  
Just give me a kiss with your lips  
Can you let me grab your hips?  
Make me stop  
I don't know  
If I can do that on my own  
  
I just like kissing your lips  
My darling girl  
I know that's not what love is  
So why can't I  
Keep mine and you keep yours?  
So we both know  
What we're still waiting for  
  
Here we are  
We're going through the motions  
Doesn't mean  
We're promising devotion  
Don't ask me  
Don't tell me, no  
This is love  
  
A cigarette is what I need  
'Cause after this I should believe  
This is love  
Understand  
That you'll have to tell your man  
(So just tell him)  
  
I just like kissing your lips  
My darling girl  
I know that's not what love is  
So why can't I  
Keep mine and you keep yours?  
So we both know  
What we're still waiting for [x2]

Chorus  
Why do why do I do  
Could it wait  
For me to realize that  
I can't make it in there  
'Cause I'm a traitor  
To believe it  
Pull back your hair  
And stop the show  
  
I got my clock  
It's twenty after  
My mind is numb  
Awaiting stimulant  
And if I break my head  
Don't shake my hand unless  
You'll charge it to  
Your spiritual credit card  
And I will take a step away  
So I can't be that happy  
  
Chorus  
  
I let my breath  
Go slow like longitude  
I'll let my eyes  
Go slow to follow you  
And if I break my head  
Don't shake my hand unless  
You have your pride  
In a drawer in my front desk, so  
Don't take a step away  
It doesn't make me feel good  
  
Chorus  
  
Before that  
Right  
In my head  
Break  
And then instead  
Forty-two hours away  
Where?  
It's in my head  
Break  
And then instead  
When you whisper  
Far away  
Another gone to yesterday  
And I will break my head  
I'm already here  
I'm already here  
I'm already here  
  
I don't need anything from you  
You needed nothing from me  
I don't have anything  
That you could give to me  
  
I don't have anything for you  
You needed nothing from me  
There's nothing that you can give  
To make me feel complete  
  
I don't need anything from you  
You needed nothing from me

It's been holidays since I've said how I feel  
Until yesterday found my whole life was new  
I can finally see that I love you that I miss you  
That I need you certainly  
But now my essence is spinning spinning away  
  
Chorus  
And I can't keep chasing your memory  
Around and around and around and around in my head  
Waiting for you to make up your mind  
I've felt this way before and  
You seem like you know what you're doing to me  
And you never could make the simple words feel right  
  
My whole life around the way you give yourself  
I've been safe and sound in my own selfish void  
But I've finally found that I hate you I dispise you  
Please don't give it away today  
But now my essence is spinning spinning away  
  
Chorus  
  
And I'll take my time  
Put your lips to mine  
You'll never grow cold  
From fear again  
But you'll grieve the day  
That I won't stay  
And then you'll realize (Then you'll realize)  
That what we had  
Was exactly what you were looking for  
  
Chorus

Can you answer me?  
No more time for questioning  
My car's outside I want to leave  
Don't you think I'm interesting  
Well, I'm listening.  
  
Everything's obvious  
The way you put your hand on me  
The way you talk so easily  
The way your lips are glistening  
Well, I'm listening.  
  
You get around  
You want me  
You come around  
You need me  
This time around  
I won't be back at all  
  
Maybe misery is  
What I need to keep my sanity  
And I don't mean if things don't go my way  
I'll be pleased to meet you  
  
And maybe yesterday  
Was a day that I could get away  
Now today I'm stuck in sanity  
And I'm pleased to meet you  
  
Right now I think I'm sane,  
But I'm really just anxious  
To cross that bridge  
The subconscious oasis  
Where right is right  
And wrong is wrong  
And you weren't there  
To build me up  
  
You get around  
You want me  
You come around  
You need me  
This time around  
I won't be back at all  
  
Maybe misery  
Is what I need to keep my sanity  
And I don't mean if things don't go my way  
I'll be pleased to meet you (pleased to meet you)  
  
And maybe yesterday  
Was a day that I could get away  
Now today I'm stuck in sanity  
And I've seen it all  
I've seen it all  
Many times before  
  
Maybe misery  
Is what I need to keep my sanity  
And I don't mean if things don't go my way  
I'll be pleased to meet you  
  
And maybe yesterday was a day that I could get away  
Now today I'm stuck in sanity  
And I've seen it all  
I've seen it all  
Many times before  
  
Maybe misery (many times before)  
Is what I need to keep my sanity (many times before)  
And I don't mean if things don't go my way (many times before)  
I'll be pleased to meet you (many times before)  
  
And maybe yesterday (many times before)  
Was a day that I could get away (many times before)  
Now today I'm stuck in sanity (many times before)  
And I've seen it all  
I've seen it all  
Many times before

Making sure  
I'm not thinking  
About the things  
That I've been missing today  
Making sure  
That I've been wanting  
More than just the  
Other malt today  
  
Why don't you go  
Try to think  
I know it's hard  
But why don't you just  
Try to think  
About the simple things  
That I can think about  
When I'm away  
  
And I already heard you  
And would you  
Please repeat it  
  
Nothing pushes me  
Further than you  
I hate it when you say  
I can't understand why  
Things are always  
The same way with you and  
Hopefully  
When you start to break  
I'll see you and then  
I'll start to change  
Wonder why it  
Just wasn't enough for me  
To look and see you there  
  
I already you heard you then  
Would you please repeat  
That question  
  
Head on the floor  
It's my deep sensibility  
'Cause you left me alone  
And I know that I'm wrong  
So just go get your fuck for me  
I left a scar  
On my evil personality  
So go find me a song  
That can fill me in on  
The way I think about  
  
Find a song  
Hang on  
Wait one more day  
Until you start to  
  
And I won't  
And I know  
And it's not  
What I feel  
  
And I can't  
Understand  
Just how much  
You can drink  
  
And I won't  
And I won't  
And you say  
Tell me the truth  
  
Couldn't even  
Tell you  
If I  
Wanted to  
  
And you  
Say that  
That I've had  
Enough  
  
To pass  
The point  
You did  
Before  
  
And I say  
And I won't  
And I know  
And I try  
To walk away  
  
Head on the floor  
It's my deep sensibility  
'Cause you left me alone  
And I know that I'm wrong  
So just go get your fuck for me  
You left a scar  
On my evil personality  
So go find me a song  
That can fill me in on  
The way I think about me

See you right around the corner  
I know that you were getting closer  
It dawned on me, it dawned on me  
That you could be the one for me  
But I'm sure you've heard it all the time  
I just look like the other guy  
Next to me, next to me  
Next to me, next to me  
  
Let's go home together  
You'll say that it's good for me  
You're good for me  
But it's all in my head  
When I wake in my bed  
Don't know  
  
I've got no motivation  
I've got not stimulation  
You could be, you could be  
The one for me  
We will see that  
I've got no motivation  
Give me some motivation  
(In this life, in this life, in this life)  
  
And I know you're not  
One of those girls  
Who takes her time  
She'll come for me, she'll come for me  
She'll come for me  
And I can wait for eternity  
For you to take your turn with me  
Turn with me, turn with me  
  
I've got no motivation  
I've got not stimulation  
You could be, you could be  
The one for me  
We will see that  
I've got no motivation  
Give me some motivation  
(In this life, in this life, in this life)  
  
Baby, it's fine  
If you want to be mine  
Just call out my name  
Don't wait in line  
Just take my hand  
And break my heart tonight  
  
I've got no motivation  
I've got not stimulation  
You could be, you could be  
The one for me  
We will see that  
I've got no motivation  
Give me some motivation  
(This life, this life, this life)  
  
Take me home with you  
I can't go alone  
And take me home tonight

Evicted from the ocean  
So far that I can see that  
Evicted from the ocean  
So far that I can see that  
  
Passing by  
My untrained eyes  
Searching for  
Your sentiment  
Made me see  
Six moves ahead  
Why can't I  
Make since of this  
  
You went away  
You went away  
You went away  
Why didn't you  
You went away  
I wouldn't stay  
I couldn't change  
  
Chorus  
But it's not quite clear  
And it's not quite dead  
What went on that night  
In my pain in my head  
And I never got  
To see you again  
Anymore  
  
I've been told  
That I was wrong  
Why can't we  
Be us again  
  
You went away  
You went away  
You went away  
Why didn't you  
You went away  
I wouldn't stay  
I couldn't change  
  
Chorus  
  
You could come stay  
What'd you say when  
I was lost  
But you expected  
I would come back home  
Would come back home  
What'd you think when  
I was lost  
But you pretended  
I was lost  
But you pretended I  
Would come back home  
  
Chorus  
  
Evicted from the ocean  
So far that I can see that  
Evicted from the ocean  
So far that I can see that

I felt this way before  
I fell right through the floor  
And I am certain I've become  
Broken, bruised, and numb  
Would you restate your opinion  
And hold back your investigation  
Do you see the sins you're making  
Cause I've made them all before  
  
I will now rise from the ashes  
Don't call me pretentious  
I'm sitting here making my own rules  
And if I fall from the ceiling  
You'll be down there waiting  
And my only hope  
Is falling down  
  
And by my own admission  
You'll find that my condition  
Is worse than you imagined  
You're better off if you know  
But every time before that I  
Tried to measure pain inside  
You can't ignore it  
Right now I can't ignore it  
  
I will now rise from the ashes  
Don't call me pretentious  
I'm sitting here making my own rules  
And if I fall from the ceiling  
You'll be down there waiting  
To finish me  
  
Inside of me (x7)  
I'll take my heart  
And rip my feelings out  
Before they make me doubt  
And I'll fall down with flames burning  
Alive again  
As long as you know that  
  
I will now rise from the ashes  
Don't call me pretentious  
I'm sitting here making my own rules  
And if I fall from the ceiling  
You'll be down there waiting  
To finish me  
Finish me

Hey, bride of mine  
I love you  
So why'd you find another  
Who would make  
Love with you?  
  
Death do us part  
Might be true  
Before the doctor asks me  
What did I do  
What did I do  
  
Hey, here's a crime  
If you've got time  
I'll tell you just what I'll do  
(Can you keep a secret, secret?)  
  
Hey, bow down low  
Does it go  
When your friends don't even know  
(You think I'm innocent)  
  
I'm just an arrogant boy  
Now you've found me out  
I'm just an arrogant boy  
I'm the last one around  
How did I get myself  
Into this secret?  
Into a secret?  
  
Hey, is it real?  
Want to feel  
Dark regret for what you've done  
(Can you keep a secret, secret?)  
  
Hey, bow down low  
Does it go  
When your friends don't even know  
(You think I'm innocent)  
  
I'm just an arrogant boy  
Now you've found me out  
I'm just an arrogant boy  
I'm the last one around  
How did I get myself  
Into this secret?  
Into a secret?  
  
What did I do?  
What did I do?  
  
Hey, bow down low  
Does it go  
When your friends don't even know  
(You think I'm innocent)  
  
I'm just an arrogant boy  
Now you've found me out  
I'm just an arrogant boy  
I'm the last one around  
I'm not the only one  
That can hear you  
That can hear you whisper  
I should have know  
To never trust you  
Now I'm sinking deeper  
Why did I get myself  
Into a secret?  
Into a secret?  
Why did I get myself  
Into a secret?  
(Into a secret?)

And we swim forever  
Stay the same forever  
  
I talked to you today  
You didn't seem depressed  
The way I acted was  
Nothing for you to test  
And I feel so sad  
That I've lost control  
  
So many chances I  
Feel like I must be wrong  
I'm misdirected by  
Communication's songs  
And I feel so sad  
That you wanted more  
  
And we swim forever  
Stay the same forever  
  
And we're wasting over  
Barren something  
Over nothing  
Like before  
We've been sidelined  
Resurrected  
Don't deserve it  
And what more  
  
And we're wasting over  
Barren something  
Over nothing  
Like before  
We've been sidelined  
Resurrected  
Don't deserve it  
And what more  
  
And we swim forever  
(And we swim forever)  
And we swim forever  
(And we swim forever)  
  
Wait until you  
Some know  
What'd you say
