If you're gonna rip my heart out,  
Could you use a knife that's dull and rust in color  
(Once I die) there will be no way that you can cover, that scar  
It's hard, I know  
  
And if I get a little blood on you  
Finally the world will know you're guilty  
(Know you're wrong)  
Of taking everything you've gotten from me no heart  
Its hard, I know  
  
[Chorus:]  
Mighty King of Avondale  
I just can't let this go  
Real life ain't no fairy tale  
I just thought you should know  
  
When you're finished with the surgery  
I really hope that you will turn to me  
And tell me all about the fun you had  
When you were cutting up, you were cutting up  
  
[Chorus]  
Mighty King of Avondale  
I just can't let this go  
Real life ain't no fairy tale  
I just thought you should know  
  
Living like a fairy tale  
The mighty King of Avondale  
It all went to his head, this royalty  
I stuck a knife into his back  
Inventiveness is what I lack  
He's always hanging up on loyalty  
  
[Chorus]  
Mighty King of Avondale  
I just can't let this go  
Real life ain't no fairy tale  
I just thought you should know

Bottoms up tonight I drink to you and I  
'Cause with the morning comes the rest of my life  
And with this empty glass I will break the past  
'Cause with the morning I can open my eyes  
I want this to be my awakening  
  
I give this one to you an anthem full of truth  
I tell you now an epic tail of what you put me through  
And even though you don't deserve one of your own  
A melody a song about the life that you let go  
I can't believe that I still care enough to write  
  
Bottoms up tonight I drink to you and I  
'Cause with the morning comes the rest of my life  
And with this empty glass I will break the past  
'Cause with the morning I can open my eyes  
I want this to be my awakening  
  
Yes I miss you still and probably always will  
I'm living with a busted heart that I will have until  
I find the strength I know it's somewhere in my bones  
To pull the curtain up again and get on with this show  
At least you know that I care enough to write  
  
Bottoms up tonight I drink to you and I  
'Cause with the morning comes the rest of my life  
And with this empty glass I will break the past  
'Cause with the morning I can open my eyes  
And maybe I will see a different destiny  
Like knowing you at all was only a bad dream  
I want this to be my awakening  
  
No rest for the wicked they say  
Forgive me if I try to change  
No rest for the wicked they say  
Forgive me if I try to change  
  
Bottoms up tonight I drink to you and I  
'Cause with the morning comes the rest of my life  
And with this empty glass I will break the past  
'Cause with the morning I can open my eyes  
And maybe I will see a different destiny  
Like knowing you at all was only a bad dream  
I want this to be my awakening

Don't know  
What I was looking for  
When I went home  
I found me alone  
And sometimes  
I need someone to say you'll be all right  
What's on your mind?  
But the water's shallow here  
And I am full of fear  
And empty handed after two long years  
  
Another sunny day in California  
I'm sure back home they'd love to see it  
But what they don't know is what you love is ripped away  
Before you get a chance to feel it  
  
Back home  
I always thought I wanted so much more  
Now I'm not too sure  
Cause sometimes  
I miss knowing someone's there for me  
And feeling free  
Free to stand beside  
The ocean in moonlight  
And light myself a smoke beneath the  
Dark Atlantic sky  
  
Another sunny day in California  
I'm sure back home they'd love to see it  
But what they don't know that what you love is ripped away  
Before you get a chance to feel it  
  
Everybody here is living life in fear  
Of falling out alive  
Tearing lives apart and breaking lots of hearts  
Just to pass the time  
And the eyes get red in the back of your head  
This place will make you blind  
Put it all behind me and  
I'll be just fine  
  
Another sunny day beneath this cloudless sky  
Sometimes I wish that it would rain here  
And wash the west coast dreaming from my eyes  
There's nothing real for them to see here  
  
Another starry night in California  
I'm sure back home they'd love to see it  
But they don't know that what you love is ripped away  
Before you get a chance to feel it

I made these wishes with you  
Went coast to coast  
And we both felt so alive (so alive)  
We traded safe for something we just had to be  
And we almost lost our minds (lost our minds)  
But we're still here searching  
  
This is loud  
This is cold  
This is endless and I know  
Growing up has just begun  
But there's a place  
We could find  
Where this pain is useless  
And we'll forever be the young  
  
Summer came and flew by twice as fast  
It was close enough to feel  
And after all this waiting for skies to fall  
I need this to be real  
Oh, please let it be real  
  
This is loud  
This is cold  
This is endless and I know  
Growing up has just begun  
(Growing up has just begun)  
But there's a place  
We could find  
Where this pain is useless  
And we'll forever be the young  
(Forever be the young)  
  
Where I was broken I am healed  
I learned to fight  
I learned to feel  
And I can't believe my eyes  
You are still here next to me  
All I need you're all I see  
In this life we hope to find  
  
This is loud  
This is cold  
This is endless and I know  
Growing up has just begun  
(Growing up has just begun)  
But there's a place  
We could find  
Where this pain is useless  
And we'll forever be the young  
(Forever be the young)  
  
This is loud  
This is cold  
This is endless and I know  
(We'll forever be the young)  
This is loud  
This is cold  
This is endless and I know  
(We'll forever be the young)  
It's endless and I know

Watching the days burning out like a cigarette, just a few drags to go.  
You built me up and you broke me down, somehow  
Everything just seemed so clear to me, nothing left to know  
I'll love you right and I'll love you pure, right now  
  
How can you say, that its too late  
To save us now  
  
And I would wait for you, if you would wait for me  
And I will Wait for you, if you will wait for me  
  
Intoxicated, the edge is serrated, so easily torn from the core  
I blushed the first time, but you blushed the last time my eyes hit your mind  
Regenerated these feelings of hatred, I long for your love ever more  
You built me up and you broke me down this time  
  
And I would wait for you, if you would wait for me  
And I will Wait for you, if you will wait for me  
  
How can you say that its too late, to save us now  
How can you say

I can't keep this together  
And I might lose this year  
I can't get through December  
And you know all my fears  
Some place somewhere behind me  
I walked right through the truth  
The truth is that you're the one thing  
That always pulls me through  
This troubled life I choose  
  
[Chorus:]  
You are the one that I need  
You know that I can still bleed  
Bring me back to life  
Bring me back to life  
You bring me down from my cloud  
You keep my feet on the ground  
Bring me back to life  
Bring me back to life  
  
When I thought that I might be invincible  
It wasn't long before I was invisible  
To your eyes, and I swear  
There's nothing left in here  
And the more you say you don't care  
The more I know you're there  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I can't keep this together  
(You are the one that I need)  
I can't stay sick forever  
(You know that I can still bleed)  
I can't stop this disaster  
(You bring me down from my cloud)  
I can't fall any faster  
  
You are the one that I need  
You know that I can still bleed  
Bring me back to life  
Bring me back to life  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You are the one that I need  
You know that I can still bleed  
You bring me down from my cloud  
You keep my feet on the ground

I work all night  
For one more day that I can say I'm all alone, alone  
I just need time  
And I will say what I believe and I'll come home, home  
And all I know  
  
[Chorus]  
I never thought I would wake up in bed  
Watching the world coming down on my head  
I'd sleep like a dog if you would never had said  
This is the world coming down on your head  
  
As life flies by  
I'm not sure how I'm gonna do this all again, again  
So write my line  
I write this down and I'm just trying to find the end, the end  
And all I know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You gave it to me  
I remember it well  
You got the world coming down on your head  
There's nothing to fight for, it's already dead  
And this is the world coming down on my head  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm not gonna swallow now that I'm fed  
'cause I want the world coming down on my head  
I'm just gonna find out you're already dead  
And that was the world coming down on your head

Call me out  
You stayed inside  
One you love  
Is where you hide  
Shot me down  
As I flew by  
Crash and burn  
I think sometimes  
You forget where the heart is  
Answer no  
To these questions  
Let her go  
Learn a lesson  
It's not me  
You're not listening now  
Can't you see  
Something's missing  
You forget where the heart is  
  
Take you away  
From that empty apartment  
You stay  
And forget where the heart is  
Someday  
If ever you loved me  
You'd say  
It's okay  
  
Waking up  
From this nightmare  
How's you're life  
What's it like there  
Is it all  
That you want it to be  
Does it hurt  
When you think about me  
And how broken my heart is  
  
Take you away  
From that empty apartment  
You stay  
And forget where the heart is  
Someday  
If ever you loved me  
You'd say it's okay  
  
It's okay to be angry and never let go  
It only gets harder the more that you know  
When you get lonely if no one's around,  
You know that I'll catch you when you're falling down  
We came together but you left alone  
And I know how it feels to walk out on your own  
Maybe someday I will see you again  
And you'll look me in my eyes and call me your friend  
  
Take you away from  
That empty apartment  
You stay and forget where the heart is  
Someday  
If ever you loved me  
You'd say it's okay  
It's okay it's okay

Turn it inside out so I can see  
The part of you that's driftin over me  
'Cause when I look you're never there  
But when I sleep you're everywhere  
You're everywhere  
  
Tell me how I got this far  
Tell me why you're here and who you are  
'Cause everytime I look  
You're never there  
And everytime I sleep  
You're always there  
  
'Cause you're everywhere to me  
And when I close my eyes  
It's you I see  
You're everything I know  
That makes me believe  
I'm not alone  
  
I recognized the way you make me feel  
It's hard to think that you might not be real  
I sense it now the water's getting deep  
I try to wash the pain away from me  
Away from me  
  
'Cause you're everywhere to me  
And when I close my eyes  
It's you I see  
You're everything I know  
That makes me believe  
I'm not alone  
I'm not alone  
  
When I touch your hand  
It's then I understand  
The beauty lies within  
It's now that we begin  
You always light my way  
Whenever comes a day  
No matter where I go  
I always feel you so  
  
'Cause you're everywhere to me  
And when I close my eyes  
It's you I see  
You're everything I know  
That makes me believe  
I'm not alone  
  
You're everywhere to me  
And when I catch my breath  
It's you I breathe  
You're everything I know  
That makes me believe  
I'm not alone  
  
And you're everyone I see,  
So tell me, do you see me?

You sat me down beside myself  
To show me all the reasons I was wrong for you  
Was this for real, it's hard to tell  
'Cause it was such a beautiful mess we had got into  
  
I'm gonna overcome this  
Paper hearts can't win this time  
And all along I should have know this  
It wasn't your dream, it was mine  
I know you wanted me to give up this life to be  
Everything I was back when you had the hands my heart was in  
I was never good at goodbye  
  
Can I swallow this bottle whole  
So this brain in my head can forget your face  
  
When we were starting out  
You believed in me without a doubt  
You were the finest thing that happened to a boy like me  
It's so much harder now  
I want to try and tell you how  
There is so much love in me  
Even though it's hard to see  
And I was never good at goodbye  
  
Can I swallow this bottle whole  
So this brain in my head can forget your face  
Can I swallow this bottle whole  
'Cause I'd rather be dead than make more mistakes  
  
Today I couldn't stay awake  
Feels like I'm drowning in this firewater lake  
I won't be sleeping much tonight  
It's not the same without you lying by my side  
Right beside me  
  
Can I swallow this bottle whole  
So this brain in my head can forget your face  
Can I swallow this bottle whole  
'Cause I'd rather be dead than make more mistakes  
  
I know you wanted me  
To give up my heart to be everything I am  
And you're the only thing that I can see  
I'm sorry, but you're not the only one for me  
  
You left me here beside myself  
Left me with all the reasons I was wrong for you

Needed some time  
So I could find  
A little strength to redefine  
What I've become  
What I have done  
I never asked to be the one  
  
I'm riding it out  
This storm that you brought in  
Bringing it down, only around  
For you I go again  
It's got to be easy to see  
What everyone takes out of me  
Knocking me down, dragging me out  
How did you end up in that crowd?  
  
[Chorus:]  
Did you run away? Did you fall apart?  
Do you see yourself for what you are?  
Will you be looking for it anymore  
When five becomes four?  
When you're all alone with the melody  
Do you close your eyes and think of me?  
Will you still hear me singing anymore  
When five becomes four?  
  
Try and put aside  
Your history and pride  
Maybe for one moment in time  
We'll all be on your side  
The story goes, nobody knows  
What it was like when you were through  
Someone who cared out in the air  
It went and crashed down anywhere  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Remember the line "never say die"?  
You were the reason I survived  
Where did you go? I need to know  
I waited here, you never showed  
It's gonna be harder for me  
I can't forgive so many things  
When you weren't there, I was around  
Why would you try and hurt me now?  
Just tell me why!  
Just tell me why!  
  
(Did you run away?)  
(Did you run away?)  
  
Did you run away? Did you fall apart?  
Do you see yourself for what you are?  
Will you be looking for it anymore  
When five becomes four?  
When you are all alone with the melody  
Do you close your eyes and think of me?  
Will you still hear me singing anymore  
When five becomes four?  
When five becomes four...  
When five becomes four...

So I'm left wondering  
there is so much left I wish that I could say to you  
Silence I keep  
For fear of breaking myself down and maybe getting through  
getting through to you  
  
For Pete's Sake  
Let's see straight  
Clench your fists up in rage  
Hurts to know  
We could throw  
All this time away  
  
Let's try and work it out  
Please don't be angry anymore I'm on your side  
I don't want to fight  
Put this hate aside  
Get back to a place where you and I can still be friends  
  
You want it, you need it  
And all the answers you're racing to find out  
They might outrun you in the end

It's 4 a.m., you call to spit some fire out  
But did you think that I would listen to you now?  
It's nothing new so get in line with all the rest  
And I will wait till you realize you're out of breath  
  
Can you hear the crowd?  
They all go wild  
For you and your denial  
They're watching you break down (break down)  
Hate me all you want,  
I'll be okay  
I'm half the world away  
I'm letting you go now (go now)  
  
You've got sadness twisted up with jealousy  
You show your fists to make them look like loyalty  
And I have seen what holding on can take away  
If it's the past you love then that's where you can stay  
  
Can you hear the crowd?  
They all go wild  
For you and your denial  
They're watching you break down (break down)  
Hate me all you want,  
I'll be okay  
I'm half the world away  
I'm letting you go now (go now)  
Go now (go now)  
  
Desperation kills  
But when it's on your sleeve you wear it well  
Underneath it all  
You'll always have this war inside yourself  
  
I'm letting you go now (go now)  
Can you hear the crowd?  
They all go wild  
For you and your denial  
They're watching you break down (break down)  
Hate me all you want,  
I'll be okay  
I'm half the world away  
I'm letting you go now (go now)  
Go now (go now)  
Go now (go now)  
Go now (go now)

Mary belongs to the words of a song  
I try to be strong for her  
Try not to be wrong for her  
She will not wait for me anymore, anymore  
Why did I say all those things before I was sure  
  
She is the one  
But I have a purpose  
She is the one  
And I have to fight this  
She is the one  
The villain I can't knock down  
  
I see your face with every punch I take  
Every bone I break  
Its all for you  
And my worst pains are words I cannot say  
Still I will always fight on for you  
  
Mary's alive  
In the bright New York sky  
And the city lights shine for her  
And above them, I cry for her  
  
Every thing's small on the ground below,  
Down below  
What if I fall then  
Where would I go  
Would she know  
  
She is the one  
All that I wanted  
She is the one  
And I will be haunted  
She is the one  
This gift is my curse for now...  
  
I see your face with every punch I take  
And every bone I break  
Its all for you  
And my worst pains are words I cannot say  
Still I will always fight on for you  
  
I see your face with every punch I take  
And my worst pains are words I cannot say  
Still I will always fight on for you  
Fight on for you  
Fight on for you

I can not hold this anymore  
My hands are tired of only waiting to let go  
And I am waiting, still  
  
I used to know which way to turn  
You were a light inside a tunnel in my head  
I try to follow, still  
I try to follow, still  
  
It's hard to see you, we are older now  
And when I find you, you just turn around  
This is a black and white of you I've found  
I hang you up and then I pull you down  
I hang you up and then I pull you down  
  
No more apologies from me  
My arms are tired of picking up what I put down  
You're all I think of, still  
  
I'm gonna miss you everyday  
I turn my back on anyone who won't believe  
And it gets lonely, still  
It gets lonely, still  
  
It's hard to see you, we are older now  
And when I find you, you just turn around  
This is a black and white of you I've found  
I hang you up and then I pull you down  
  
I hang you up and then I pull you down  
  
I get lost sometimes  
Another year flies by  
But I know if I try  
Memories of the light in your eyes  
Can take me back in time  
  
It's hard to see you, we are older now  
And when I find you, you just turn around  
This is a black and white of you I found  
I hang you up and then I pull you down  
It's hard to see you we are older now (we are older now)  
And when I find you, you just turn around (you turn around)  
This is a black and white of you I found (you I found)  
I hang you up and then I pull you down  
(Pull you down)  
I hang you up and then I pull you down  
(Pull you down)  
I hang you up and then I pull you down  
(Pull you down)  
  
I don't hear music anymore  
My ears are tired of all the pictures in the words  
'Cause you are in them, still

If I could write to the kid I was before  
I'd tell him you'd get everything you ever wanted  
But you will still want more  
Someone's gonna tell you  
Who you should wanna be  
So you forget the vision that they didn't want to see  
And when they give up, 'cause they will give up say  
"Here I am alive"  
  
They say you don't grow up you just grow old  
It's safe to say I haven't done both  
I made mistakes, I know, I know  
But here I am alive  
So many people close to me cut me down  
This is supposed to be a bad luck town  
I jumped, I fell, I hit the ground  
But here I am alive  
  
If I could write to myself when I was on top of it all,  
I'd say you're going overboard and when you are falling  
You're gonna feel so small  
Someone's gonna tell you that you deserve the worst  
They'd say you're never coming back and tell you that you're cursed  
But when they give up, 'cause they always give up say-  
"Here I am alive"  
  
They say you don't grow up you just grow old  
It's safe to say I haven't done both  
I made mistakes, I know, I know  
But here I am alive  
So many people close to me cut me down  
This is supposed to be a bad luck town  
I jumped, I fell, I hit the ground  
But here I am alive  
  
And when they give up, 'cause they will give up  
Say: "Here I am alive!!"  
And when they give up, 'cause they always give up  
Say: "Here I am alive!!"  
  
They say you don't grow up you just grow old  
It's safe to say I haven't done both  
I made mistakes, I know, I know  
But here I am alive  
So many people close to me cut me down  
This is supposed to be a bad luck town  
I jumped, I fell, I hit the ground  
But here I am alive  
  
Here I am alive  
(Here I am alive)  
Here I am alive  
(Here I am alive)  
Here I am alive  
(Here I am alive)  
Here I am alive  
(Here I am)  
  
If I could write to the kid I was before

Haven't heard from you in days  
I'm spreading thin what I've got taped.  
And I've come down from your highest ties.  
Now what the hell am I supposed to say.  
  
Whoa. I know it feels like I let you down.  
But I'm still around.  
  
If you can't find a way to reach me,  
Take your time I could be underneath you  
And looking up to see you from where we used to hide.  
From where we used to hide.  
  
Busy writing thoughts tonight.  
A message sent with no reply  
You used to hang on my every word.  
Now they never come out right.  
  
Whoa. I know it feels like I let you down.  
But I'm still a round.  
  
If you can't find a way to reach me,  
Take your time I could be underneath you  
And looking up to see you from where we used to hide.  
From where we used to hide.  
  
You are invisible in this. (so invisible in this)  
Your too caught up in what you missed. (caught in what you missed)  
So spend what I gave, I give you more.  
You are invisible in this.  
  
If you can't find a way to reach me,  
Take your time I could be underneath you  
And looking up to see you from where we used to hide.  
From where we used to hide.  
  
If you can't find a way to reach me,  
Take your time cause I am underneath you,  
Looking up to see you from where we used to hide.  
From where we used to hide.

Accidents out on the highway to somewhere,  
They tell us about when we're young,  
Rescuers working to clean up the crashes  
Before she can see what they've done ,  
Nobody told her she'd lose in the first round,  
The last fight was fixed from the start,  
Names on her sidewalks they move through her body,  
Like razors they cut through her heart  
Like razors they cut through her heart  
  
Hey let go of all you know,  
You're flying away now  
What have you got to lose  
Say out loud these words I've found  
I'll be there when you come down  
I'll be waiting for you  
  
Night life the highlife she just wants a good life  
So someone remembers her too  
But somewhere she heard there was someplace to go  
When you die when you live like we do  
Die when you live like we do  
  
Hey let go of all you know,  
I'm finding a way now  
What have you got to lose  
Say out loud these words I've found  
I'll be there when you come down  
I'll be waiting for you  
  
Hey let go of all you know,  
You're flying away now  
What have you got to lose  
Say out loud these words I've found  
I'll be there when you come down  
I'll be waiting for you

Here, a little sympathy, for you to waste on me I know you're faking it, but
that's OK  
And I  
Don't want to drag it out  
Don't want to bring you down  
I never wanted it to end this way  
  
Even if I wanted to  
I don't think that I did to you  
There's nothing I can say or do to make you feel alive again  
  
Here, a little jealousy, I hope you think of me  
Hope you wonder where I sleep at night  
Cause I feel like I'm inside out  
You got me upside down  
Maybe I was holding on too tight  
  
Even if I wanted to  
I don't think that I did to you  
There's nothing I can say or do to make you feel alive again  
  
So don't you say goodbye to me  
Just turn your back away and leave  
And if you're lucky I will be your last regret your only friend  
  
The two of us we dream like one  
The two of us  
The two of us  
  
The two of us take breath like one  
The two of us  
The two of us  
  
The two of us we dream like one  
The two of us  
The two of us  
  
The two of us take breath like one  
The two of us  
The two of us  
  
I guess that this is over now  
I guess it's called a falling out  
But every day I'm learning how to make it though this life I'm in  
  
Even if I wanted to  
I don't think that I did to you  
There's nothing I can say or do to make you feel alive again  
  
So don't you say goodbye to me  
Just turn your back away and leave  
And if you're lucky I will be your last regret your only friend

I wanna love, I wanna leave  
I want you to love me, I want you to leave me  
I want to stand where I can see  
I'm watching you love me, I'm watching you leavin' me now  
  
[Chorus:]  
But I wish I could be somebody else  
I wish I could see you in myself  
I wish there was something inside me to keep you beside me  
And say what you really feel  
You know I need something that's real  
I wish there was something inside me to keep you beside me  
  
I wanna know if I could be  
Someone to turn to that could never hurt you  
But I know what you think of me  
Yeah, you had a breakthrough and now I'm just bad news for you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I should've told you everything  
I never gave you anything  
I should've told you everything  
If I could give you anything  
Then I would tell you everything  
  
I wish I could be somebody else  
I wish I could see you in myself  
I wish there was something inside me to keep you beside me  
And say what you really feel  
You know I need something that's real  
I wish there was something inside me to keep you beside me  
  
I should've told you everything  
I should've told you everything  
I should've told you everything

What's a dad for dad?  
Tell me why I'm here dad  
Whisper in my ear that I'm growing up to be a better man, dad  
Everything is fine dad  
Proud that you are mine dad  
Cause I know I'm growing up to be a better man  
  
Father I will always be  
That same boy that stood by the sea  
And watched you tower over me  
Now I'm older I want to be the same as you  
  
What's a dad for dad?  
Taught me how to stand, dad  
Took me by the hand and you showed me how to be a bigger man, dad  
Listen when you talk, dad  
Follow where you walk, dad  
And you know that I will always do the best I can  
I can  
  
Father I will always be (always be)  
That same boy that stood by the sea  
And watched you tower over me (over me)  
Now I'm older I want to be the same as you  
The same as you  
  
Father I will always be  
That same boy that stood by the sea  
And watched you tower over me  
Now I'm older I want to be the same as you  
  
(When I am a dad, dad  
I'm gonna be a good dad  
Did the best you could, dad  
Always understood, dad  
Tell me I was right, dad  
Opened up my eyes, dad  
Proud to call you my, dad  
Thank you for my life dad

I can see all the footsteps left behind every second I gave.  
Every song was a snapshot of my life I needed something to say.  
  
It started out in the last slow motion scene watching everyone change.  
Made a map of the one way road from here, I had no reason to stay.  
  
I am awake and alive there is something calling me.  
More than a moment in time, it's a dream I'm following on my own.  
(On my own) On my own.  
More than a moment in time, it's a life of leaving home.  
  
Think of me when the stars come out tonight, take a look at the sky.  
I never said I could burn out that bright, but I needed to try.  
  
I am awake and alive there is something calling me.  
More than a moment in time, it's a dream I'm following on my own.  
(On my own) On my own.  
More than a moment in time, it's a life of leaving home.  
  
The day that I found my voice, I knew that I had no choice.  
The only way that I'd ever learn to love is if i found it on my own.  
On my own.  
  
I am awake and alive there is something calling me.  
More than a moment in time, it's a dream I'm following on my own.  
(On my own) On my own.  
On my own (on my own) On my own (on my own)  
More than a moment in time, it's a life of leaving home.

You're making a choice to live like this  
And all of the noise - I am silence  
We already know how it ends tonight  
You run in the dark through a firefight  
And I would explode just to save your life  
Yeah, I would explode  
  
Let me light up the sky  
Light it up for you  
Let me tell you why  
I would die for you  
Let me light up the sky  
  
I can't find a wall to pin this to  
They're all coming down since I've found you  
I just wanna be where you are tonight  
I run in the dark looking for some light  
And how will we know if we just don't try  
We won't ever know  
  
Let me light up the sky  
Light it up for you  
Let me tell you why  
I would die for you  
Let me light up the sky  
Light it up for you  
Let me make this mine  
I'll ignite for you  
  
Let me light up the sky  
Just for you tonight  
Let me help you fly  
'Cause you won't have time  
To cover your eyes  
Or get your disguise  
They won't ask you why  
They'll just watch you die  
  
And it's still so hard to be who you are  
So you play this part  
And the show goes on  
But you've come this far with a broken heart  
Yeah, you've come this far  
And you're broken  
  
Let me light up the sky  
Light it up for you  
Let me tell you why  
I would die for you  
Let me light up the sky  
Light it up for you  
Let me make this mine  
I'll ignite for you  
I'll ignite for you  
  
Let me light up the sky  
Light it up for you  
Let me tell you why  
I would die for you  
  
And it's still so hard to be who you are  
But you've come this far with a broken heart  
And it's still so hard to be who you are  
But you've come this far and you're broken  
  
Let me light up the sky  
Let me light up the sky

There's a place off Ocean Avenue  
Where I used to sit and talk with you  
We were both 16 and it felt so right  
Sleeping all day, staying up all night  
Staying up all night  
  
There's a place on the corner of Cherry Street  
We would walk on the beach in our barefeet  
We were both 18 and it felt so right  
Sleeping all day, staying up all night  
Staying up all night  
  
If I could find you now things would get better  
We could leave this town and run forever  
Let your waves crash down on me  
And take me away, yeah yeah  
  
There's a piece of you that's here with me  
It's everywhere I go, it's everything I see  
When I sleep I dream and it gets me by  
I can make believe that you're here tonight  
That your here tonight  
  
If I could you find now things would get better  
We could leave this town and run forever  
I know somewhere, somehow we'll be together  
Let your waves crash down on me  
And take me away, yeah  
  
I remember the look in your eyes  
When I told you that this was goodbye  
You were begging me not tonight  
Not here, not now  
We're looking up at the same night sky  
We keep pretending the sun will not rise  
We'll be together for one more night  
Somewhere, somehow  
  
If I could find you now things would get better  
We could leave this town and run forever  
I know somewhere, somehow we'll be together  
Let your waves crash down on me  
And take me away, yeah yeah

Sew this up with threads of reason and regret  
So I will not forget, I will not forget  
How this felt one year six months ago i know  
I cannot forget, I cannot forget  
  
I'm falling into memories of you  
Things we used to do  
Follow me there a beautiful somewhere  
A place that I can share with you  
  
I can tell that you don't know me anymore  
It's easy to forget sometimes we just forget  
Being on this road is anything but sure  
Maybe we'll forget I hope we don't forget  
  
I'm falling into memories of you  
Things we used to do  
Follow me there a beautiful somewhere  
A place that I can share with you  
  
So many nights  
Legs tangled tight  
Wrap me up in a dream with you  
Close up these eyes  
Try not to cry  
All that i got to pull me through  
Is memories of you  
  
I'm falling into memories of you  
Things we used to do  
Follow me there a beautiful somewhere  
A place that we can share  
  
Falling into memories of you  
Things we used to do

Lying soaked in sweat tonight,  
Your knuckles white,  
you try to fight,  
The need for more to get you by,  
You've had enough,  
You wonder why,  
Even now your body cries,  
For chemicals to blind your eyes,  
Wonder can you stay this high,  
When the cells begin to die  
Forever, Forever, Forever,  
  
Crush it up, crush it up,  
Take it down, take it down,  
Smash it up, Smash it up,  
Falling Down  
  
Swallowed like the medicine,  
That's broken down my happy friend,  
Wonder if he'll let me in,  
When I come to see him when,  
He's Better, Better, Better,  
No  
  
Crush it up, crush it up,  
Take it down, take it down,  
Smash it up, smash it up,  
Falling down  
  
Crush it up, crush it up,  
Take it down, take it down,  
Smash it up, smash it up,  
Falling down  
  
There's power,  
In the powder,  
Dissolving in your guts  
  
There's power,  
In the powder,  
Dissolving in your guts  
  
Crush it up, crush it up,  
Take it down, take it down,  
Smash it up, smash it up,  
Falling down  
  
Crush it up, crush it up,  
Take it down, take it down,  
Smash it up, smash it up,  
Falling down  
  
(I'm Falling) Crush it up, crush it up,  
(I'm Falling) Take it down, take it down,  
(I'm Falling) Smash it up, smash it up,  
Falling Down  
  
(I'm Falling) Crush it up, crush it up,  
(I'm Falling) Take it down, take it down,  
(I'm Falling) Smash it up, smash it up,  
Falling Down  
  
Falling,  
I'm falling,  
I'm falling,  
I'm falling down

Here I go again  
Another leap of faith  
I close my eyes and wait to fall  
I see a future in which I will soon become  
The only truth you know at all  
You wanna know what I'm thinking  
I think about back then  
  
Back when we built something new  
The world was ours to conquer  
And we were not afraid to lose ourselves  
Somewhere inside this, you changed  
And I could never follow you that way  
  
I miss you madly and it's raining on the coast  
I'm supposed to say "this was your loss", and "I'm fine"  
I stare for hours at these numbers in my hand  
But ringing you would mend your heart, and break mine  
You wanna know what I'm thinking  
I think about back then  
  
Back when we built something new  
The world was ours to conquer  
And we were not afraid to lose ourselves  
Somewhere inside this, you changed  
And I could never follow you that way  
  
(Sometimes I dream)  
We laugh 'til we cry  
(With smoke in our eyes)  
Just like old times  
Never again  
That was back then  
  
Back when we built something new  
The world was ours to conquer  
And we were not afraid to lose ourselves  
Somewhere inside this, you changed  
And I could never follow you that way  
  
Somewhere inside this, you changed  
And I could never follow you that way

Sleeping late on  
Warm afternoon  
Waking up to  
Bright silver moon  
  
Silent words from  
My heart to you  
My empty filled  
Filled up with you  
  
Rockets fly  
Rockets fly  
I slip another smile in your pocket  
My heart is racing to you like a rocket  
  
Rockets fly  
Rockets fly  
I slip another smile in your pocket  
My heart is racing to you like a rocket  
The two of us we dream like one  
Our energy could light the sun  
The two of us take breath as one  
The two of us... The two of us...

Like a Saturday night I'll be gone  
Like a Saturday night I'll be gone  
Before you knew that I was there  
  
So you wrote it down  
I'm supposed to care  
Even though it's never there  
Sorry if I'm not prepared  
Is it hard to see the things you substitute  
For me and all my thoughts of you  
It's eating me alive to leave you  
  
Maybe it's childish and maybe it's wrong  
But so is your blank stare in lieu of this song  
Maybe it's childish and maybe it's wrong  
  
Don't want to be, don't want to be wrong  
You're leaving me, you're leaving me in lieu of this song  
Don't want to be, don't want to be wrong  
You're leaving me, you're leaving me in lieu of this, lieu of this song.  
  
I'm breathing in your skin tonight  
Quiet is my loudest cry  
Wouldn't want to wake the eyes that make me melt inside  
And if it's healthier to leave you be  
May a sickness come and set me free  
Kill me while I still believe that you were meant for me  
  
I'm finding my own words, my own little stage  
My own epic drama, my own scripted page  
I'll send you the rough draft, I'll seal it with tears  
Maybe you'll read it and I'll reappear  
From the start it was shaky and the characters rash,  
A nice setting for heartache where emotions come last  
All I have deep inside, to overcome this desire  
Are friendly intentions and fair-weather smiles  
  
And I don't want to be, don't want to be wrong  
You're leaving me, you're leaving me in lieu of this song  
Don't want to be, don't want to be wrong  
You're leaving me, you're leaving me in lieu of this, in lieu of this song  
  
Like Saturday night I'll be gone  
Like Saturday night I'll be gone  
Like Saturday night I'll be gone  
Like Saturday night I'll be gone before you knew that I was there

I'm back, back in town  
And everything has changed  
I feel, feel let down  
The faces stay the same  
I see, see shadows  
Of who we used to be  
When I drive, drive so slow  
Through this memory  
  
When we were only kids  
And we were best of friends  
And we hoped for the best  
And let go of the rest  
  
I heard, heard myself  
Say things I take back  
If I could, could retell  
And make these stories last  
I see, see shadows  
Of who we'll always be  
When I drive, drive these roads  
That made our memories  
  
When we were only kids  
And we were best of friends  
And we hoped for the best  
And let go from the rest  
The shadows and regrets  
We let go of the rest  
  
Everything has changed (everything has changed)  
The faces stay the same (faces stay the same)  
Everything has changed (everything has changed)  
The faces stay the same  
  
And we were only kids  
And our time couldn't end  
And how tall did we stand  
With the world in my hands  
  
And we were only kids  
And we were best of friends  
And we hoped for the best  
And let go of the rest  
The shadows and regrets  
We let go of the rest  
The shadows and regrets  
We let go of the rest

Look at me  
And listen close  
So I can tell you how I feel before I go  
Just a year  
It's not much time  
For me to show you I am proud that you are mine  
  
I wish I had known  
The future in my heart  
Was just about to start  
  
Say tomorrow  
I can follow you there  
Just close your eyes  
And sing for me  
I will hear you  
Always near you  
And I'll give you the words  
Just sing for me  
  
Every lock  
On every door  
I put them there to try and hide you from the world  
And you kicked  
Yeah you screamed  
You never understood you're everything to me  
  
I just hope you know  
The future in your heart  
Is just about to start  
  
Say tomorrow  
I can follow you there  
Just close your eyes  
And sing for me  
I will hear you  
Always near you  
And I'll give you the words  
Just sing for me  
  
No looking back when I am gone  
(Sing for me)  
Following your heart its never wrong  
(Sing for me)  
No looking back when I am gone  
(Sing for me)  
Don't second guess the note you're on  
  
Out of time  
All out of fight  
You are the only thing in life that I got right  
  
Say tomorrow  
I can follow you there  
Just close your eyes  
And sing for me  
I will hear you  
Always hear you  
And I'll give you the words  
Just sing for me  
  
Just close your eyes  
And sing for me  
Just close your eyes  
And sing for me

All that I need to hear from you  
something of value but something untrue  
All that I wished that I'd find within you  
  
See how what she wanted and she needed  
Tore it all down in the end  
Some how like a sickness she infects me  
She's simple but deadly my friend  
  
All that I needed to hear from you  
Something of value but something untrue  
All that I wished that I'd find within you  
Stings when I see all the ways that you  
  
Took me for granted and told me it's through  
Picked from my pockets and smiled  
Empty is nothing and nothing is you  
Think I'll just sit for a while  
  
See how what I wanted and I needed  
It wasn't enough in the end  
somehow with a quickness I forgot her  
I realized she wasn't my friend

I heard a voice last night  
It said wake up and open your eyes  
Wake up walk out tonight  
'Cause she don't care if you're dead or alive  
Dead or alive  
  
She moves like beams of light  
Straight through this universe in my head  
Where I get peace of mind  
Free from the stupid things that I said  
She's all in my head  
  
Did I get lost while I was gone  
I traveled space for much too long  
But there's a planet I have found  
And you are far away  
  
Somewhere behind her eyes  
Some supernatural energy  
Takes me for quite the ride  
Across time where I defy gravity  
This energy  
  
Did I get lost while I was gone  
I traveled space for much too long  
But there's a planet I have found  
And you are far away for now  
  
Did I get lost while I was gone  
I traveled space for much too  
Did I get lost while I was gone  
I traveled space for much too long  
But there's a planet I have found  
And you are far away  
(Far away)  
You are far away  
Far away for now

Where is your inspiration, you lost it, oh so long ago  
so much for innovation, I saw this coming long before  
You had no motivation, your hopes are high but trapped below,  
This constant competition, we've won but your still keeping score  
  
But I grew up, wishing on a star  
Your think I won't ever get to far.  
  
So high on dedication, it feels so good to get away,  
From all this repetition, this angry town, this battleground  
So now we'll break tradition, we'll leave you swimming in our wake  
Without your inspiration, you can survive, you'll surely drown  
  
But I grew up, wishing on a star  
Your think I won't ever get to far  
But I grew up, wishing on a star  
You think I won't ever get to far  
Where is your inspiration, you lost it oh so long ago  

This is a story full of restless nights  
Of do or do not 'cause there is no try  
Across a decade we flew high and we fell low  
And getting up when we're dragged down is all we've known  
  
We were born to be the ones  
To show the faithless what we've done  
And there's a fire inside  
We were born to be the ones  
To show the faithless what we've done  
And there's a fire inside  
It burns like the surface of the sun  
  
Here in this Angel City lights will shine  
(Lights will shine)  
And for a while we let ourselves go blind  
But now we know who loves and loves us not  
And they're worth every good thing we have lost  
  
(Ooh!)  
We were born to be the ones  
To show the faithless what we've done  
And there's a fire inside  
We were born to be the ones(Born to be)  
To show the faithless what we've done  
And there's a fire inside  
It burns like the surface of the sun  
  
We were born to be the ones  
And burn like the surface of the sun  
(Ooh!)  
To show the faithless what we've done  
(Ooh!)  
And burn like the surface of the sun  
  
And all the million miles to go  
Not over yet, not even close  
  
We were born to be the ones  
To show the faithless what we've done  
And there's a fire inside  
We were born to be the ones  
To show the faithless what we've done  
And there's a fire inside  
It burns like the surface of the sun  
  
(Ooh!)  
  
We were born to be the ones  
(Ooh!)  
And burn like the surface of the sun  
(Ooh!)  
To show the faithless what we've done  
(Ooh!)  
And burn like the surface of the sun

I've been here a while  
Staring at this screen wondering what I'll write  
Things I can't explain  
But should've tried to say when I had the time  
  
You were inspiration  
When no one else believed  
You showed me strength in my skin  
That no one else could see  
  
Let's just keep driving on  
All the stars jumping in through the windows  
Let's go where we belong  
Headed fast as we can for the unknown  
  
I remember how  
Like a telescope you could always find  
(You could always find)  
Something worth a wish  
You said every day's a gift and we'll be alright  
(We'll be alright)  
  
And something took you from me  
I can't understand why  
But wherever you're resting (I'm carrying)  
I'm carrying your line  
  
Let's just keep driving on  
All the stars jumping in through the windows  
Let's go where we belong  
Headed fast as we can for the unknown  
  
You can stay there  
And it's not fair  
Those were the days when we laughed all the while  
When the fireflies  
Lit up our skies  
Those were the nights when the world made us smile  
  
My only hope  
You're my telescope  
My only hope  
You're my telescope  
My only hope  
You're my telescope  
My only hope  
You're my telescope  
  
(Let's just keep driving on)  
(Let's go where we belong)  
  
Let's just keep driving on  
All the stars jumping in through the windows  
Let's go where we belong  
Headed fast as we can for the unknown  
  
You can stay there  
And it's not fair  
Those were the days when we laughed all the while  
When the fireflies  
Lit up our skies  
Those were the nights when the world made us smile  
  
My only hope  
You're my telescope  
(My only hope)  
(You're my telescope)  
My only hope  
You're my telescope  
(My only hope)  
  
My only hope  
You're my telescope

Mm  
Mm  
  
I found out in the fall I've been gone  
On the road for a year  
She said,  
"Honey, I've got real bad news" and  
Then there were just tears  
And we would never be the same again  
Since then I've often wondered  
What you might have been like  
How it would have felt to hold you,  
Would you have my eyes?  
Don't you think we would've been best friends?  
  
You would be ten and I'd be  
Driving you to school  
You would tell all your friends  
That you thought I was cool  
And you would have  
All the love in my heart  
Yeah, you would have  
All the love in my heart  
  
We were twenty-two years young then  
Breaking rules all around  
We were  
Moving in that first apartment  
It felt like it was never gonna end  
Both so lost and crazy  
We were young so we ran  
Now I live in a dream where I am  
Holding your little hands  
I never got to meet you, my best friend  
  
You would be ten and I'd be  
Driving you to school  
You would tell all your friends  
That you thought I was cool  
You would be out in the sun  
Until it was gone  
You would be watching Star Wars  
With your PJ's on  
And you would have  
All the love in my heart  
Yeah, you would have  
All the love in my heart  
  
Mm  
Mm  
  
Don't you think we would have been best friends?  
  
You would be ten and I'd be  
Driving you to school  
You would tell all your friends  
That you thought I was cool  
You would be out in the sun  
Until it was gone  
You would be watching Star Wars  
With your PJ's on  
You would be playing tunes on  
On your first guitar  
You would be harmony to  
Every single part of me  
And you have  
All the love in my heart  
Yeah, you would have  
All the love in my heart  
  
Mm  
Mm

Hello friend, it's been too long and every town sings the same sad song.  
Without you here, this hotel year  
will sure slow down, with so much left to hear.  
  
Let's take back down that highway now  
Blast stereo's loud  
Let's take back down that highway now  
  
The finish line is almost here  
And someone softly whispers in my ear  
"Times like these, are memories,  
to hold deep down inside of you and me"  
  
Let's take back down that highway now  
Blast stereo's loud  
Let's take back down that highway now  
  
I'm not leaving you  
I'm not leaving  
I'm not leaving you  
(Goodbye friend, it won't be long)  
I'm not leaving  
(And until then we'll sing the same sad song)  
  
(Same sad song)  
  
Let's take back down that highway now  
Blast stereo's loud  
Let's take back down that highway now

I got to tell you that he waited all his life  
For someone like you to come make the wrong things right  
I know he didn't have the answers all the time  
But you can't tell me that you've never told a lie  
  
We're almost twenty-three and you're still mad at me  
So much that I said to you and I want to take it back now  
Twenty-three and it's so sad to me  
You tell the world I'm dead to you  
But I know you want me back now  
  
Was it fun for you to watch him fall apart? (Watch me fall)  
And suffocate him while you held him in your arms (in your arms)  
I swear to God I wish he never let you in (let you in)  
And I just hope we never hear from you again  
  
We're almost twenty-three and you're still mad at me  
So much that I said to you and I want to take it back now  
Twenty-three and it's so sad to me  
you tell the world I'm dead to you  
But I know you want me back  
  
Wasted on you (wasted on you)  
Wasted on you (so much time I've)  
Wasted on you (wasted on you)  
Wasted on you  
On you  
On you  
  
Twenty-three and you're still mad at me  
So much that I said to you and I want to take it back now  
Twenty-three and it's so sad to me  
You tell the world I'm dead to you  
But I know you want me back now

You and me  
A little different  
Though we tried to stay the same  
It never leaves  
And when it changes it is still a waiting game  
  
I wait for a lonely breath  
I wait to surface from this death  
Wait for the light to come  
And take away these images I get  
In my head  
  
[Chorus]  
More than ever  
I need to feel you  
More than ever  
I see the real you  
  
You are me  
A worst disaster would be waking up alone  
Now we're free  
We're drifting out  
Like all the ones we didn't know  
I wait for a silent tear  
I wait for things to disappear  
Wait for the ground to stop moving underneath my only fear  
If I lose you I don't know  
  
More than ever  
I need to feel you  
It's all around  
More than ever  
I see the real you  
And it's around  
  
Everything, everything  
We've had  
Out of sight out of mind  
Given that  
What I see when I dream  
Hurts like hell and back  
  
Everything, everything  
We've had  
Out of sight out of mind  
Given that  
What I see when I dream  
Hurts like hell and back  
  
[Chorus]

I think I'm breaking out  
I'm gonna leave you now  
There's nothing for me here it's all the same  
And even though I know  
That everything might go  
Go downhill from here I'm not afraid  
  
Way away away from here I'll be  
Way away away so you can see  
How it feels to be alone and not believe  
Anything  
  
You can't stop me now  
You can't hold me down  
You can't keep me here I'm on my way  
I made it this far now  
And I'm not burning out  
No matter what you say I'm not afraid  
  
Way away away from here I'll be  
Way away away so you can see  
How it feels to be alone and not believe  
Anything  
  
Letting out the noise inside of me  
Every window pane is shattering  
Cutting up my words before I speak  
This is how it feels to not believe  
  
Way away away from here I'll be  
Way away away so you can see  
How it feels to be alone and not believe  
Anything

The whole world was sleeping  
And I was there  
You could just sense this feeling in the air  
Like no one's words were good enough to define what we feared  
And no one's words were strong enough to fix what happened here  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Lead on to save me  
Lead us all there  
Find me some answers  
One nation beware  
Can't tell the difference between myth and man  
Or what's necessary or where I should stand  
  
The whole world is different now men have died  
They can just sense this feeling in our eyes  
Like no one's hands are big enough  
To hold onto this fear  
And no one's hands are strong enough to fix what happened here  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So do we do now  
Raise our voices loud  
Were searching for something that cannot be found  
Here open mouths  
I see open hands  
Blinded and silent I can't understand  
  
The whole word is watching with one blank stare  
I can just sense this feeling of ill-repair  
Like no ones heart is full enough  
To keep away this fear  
And no ones heart is strong enough to fix what happened here  
  
Lead on to save me  
Lead us all there  
Find me some answers  
Its time that you cared  
Can't tell the difference between myth and man  
Or what's necessary or where I should stand  
  
So do we tell now  
Raise our voices loud  
We're searching for something that cannot be found  
I hear open mouths  
And I see open hands  
Like the blinded and silent I can't understand.
