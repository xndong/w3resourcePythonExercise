And he did, so it's on, dj play my favorite song

I guess I'll hit club Niggas and go and get a drank or two  
And who do I see at the end of the bar?  
It's that booty club playa, the same one without no car  
Spendin' his mad little ends on some ass and his friends  
And now the night begins as I hit the gentlemen's  
And then after then, I'm a' go and head over to Magic City  
Where I can get slizzard some mo', and see a lot mo' titties  
And bitties actin' shitty for somethin' they ain't got  
So look here shawty, it ain't no need you gettin' hot

Nigga I'm big pistol, drank another drank of win'  
On the dance wit' cha'

Chargin' five hundred, but I ain't got it to give her  
Put my paper down, cut her up like a swisher  
Damn, I'm that club bandit, nigga they call me mister  
That nigga in the club payin' bills to your sister

Now once again, I go crunk off in the back

And now it's on the crack, and we actin', and cuttin' the fool  
For every benjamin that we spend ain't nothin' cool  
So I'm a' let you know, just in case you didn't know

No day I hustle baby no day gotta hustle baby  
  
I'm a crime time hustler man, I tried to tell 'em  
My crew 'cause its the ex-convict, convicted fellon  
Banana clips bazmellons of all these stitches telling  
The bitches of bazballers and secrets of shotcallers  
Of better rounds of scopping he said lue a-town to Oakland  
Niggas praying and hoping, they don't get caught with dope and  
Out a catin' and a cripping in Chicago they folking  
Down south we got 36 oles traping and focus  
This is no hocus pocus, play the game like locus  
Players vibe up and whittin' I'm the third cosmoses  
  
[Chorus]  
  
My pimping is old school, and they Chevy with bleak shoes  
Tip tops and flip flops, Adidas and suede pumas  
Who nigga fo like why'all they never going change that  
They slang goin where I hang and my bitches they who'd-a-rest  
And we all drink do-duces of dat go for 5  
We'll put that hot heat like between your eyes  
And I keep it under the seat in the summer they sweating me  
Coming down your street with beat sitting on some chesly feet  
Outta town in that's gold rims, for shawty be serving them  
Everytime my Chevy stop my rims they still spin  
A-town for life why'all we never going change that  
Still roll with them dope boys on the bow with them J's at  
  
[Chorus: Repeats]

I'm gonna get it and we gonna get it and you gona feel it and you gonna get it

Ill flip it (ill flip it)  
Pull it pull it ill straight get it  
I'mma climb  
I ain't waitin'  
There's no end to the money I'm makin'  
For streetin for chasin' we get it in  
The crunk hatin'  
  
If ya don't believe you don't succeed  
And if ya don't apply you won't achieve  
Keep ya head up high  
Feet down low and follow your heart  
To get to the door  
  
If there is a will then here's a way (not bells and wheels and wheels away)  
Never trust a soul I'm here to say  
Stop dependin' and be yourself  
And grab a hold and don't look left  
So take a swing now here's your chance  
You got nothing to lose so make a stance  
See the clock is tickin' and time ain't waitin' when ya  
All alone see that's what your facin'  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Ya I know I'mma make it I was meant for this  
I'mma with ya in the eye lookin' for the ten for this  
And I don't steal for this I pimp for this  
Ride round with a hundred round clip for this  
What happen to the struggle its called  
And eviction notice  
Now people strong self eviction notice  
Prescription cops serve keep it real  
That fine but if I get wit it I'mma face some time  
And its hard being young and rich  
Trying to survive  
Trying to keep a shot to shine  
On the poor headed ties  
Couple mill  
And I buy new whip for the wife  
Talk that shit but this is my life  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I'm gonna get it and we gonna get it and you gona feel it and you gonna get it  
I'm gonna get it and we gonna get it and you gonna get it and you gonna feel
it  
I'm gonna get it and we gonna get it and you gona feel it and you gonna get it  
I'm gonna get it and we gonna get it and you gonna get it and you gonna feel
it  
  
[Chorus: Repeat 2X]  
  
I'm gonna get it and we gonna get it and you gona feel it and you gonna get it  
I'm gonna get it and we gonna get it and you gonna get it and you gonna feel

I'm gonna get it and we gonna get it and you gona feel it and you gonna get it  
I'm gonna get it and we gonna get it and you gonna get it and you gonna feel
it

It ain't a thang in this world that's gonna knock me off my feet  
As I unleash total chaos into the streets  
For I observe these dirty words whispering' through your mouth  
So I now I take it you the big dog about the south  
Oh really now, though whose to say that we won't never make it  
Or even get the chance to tell the world just how we made it  
Cause know that we gonna keep it crunk, no matter what  
Now who the fuck, just al nut, it's a must for you to get crushed  
So don't rush to get dat' change  
You'd besta wake on up and take a look inside this frame  
For everything ain't everything when times are gettin' rough  
To pressure is your conscience in this game you callin' bluff  
Now nigga what, yeah  
Oh, a lot of hatin' went on doing this thang here  
Folks just swore we wasn't finna' put it down for the A-town  
You know what I'm saying? I ain't gotta call no names  
Cause you know who you are  
You know what I'm sayin'  
All I got to say to all of y'all is...  
You can't keep nobody from the Attic down  
Know what I'm sayin', and that's on the floor  
Yea, it's me, remember me from back in the day  
The same ol' nigga you thought wouldn't get paid  
Look at me now nigga, shit done changed  
Ain't no mo' gettin' wet in the rain  
Hennessey and dank to kill all my pain  
Sho' nuff' you can hear, but you can't feel me man  
And it's a damn shame, we go through what we do  
Playa hatin' while I'm chillin' on the avenue  
Can't hold no nigga down from the Attic Crew  
that's for trill on the blow, straight from me to you  
Better listen up now, cause ain't no tellin' what's next  
The dem' between real and the ones that flex  
All in your face grinnin' when you cash that check  
But when they get down and dirty it's like "fuck dat' bitch"  
Ass nigga, so how you figga' I was wrong  
Got a baby, and a crib to keep clothes on  
Long time ago, way before the grind  
Trouble had become a friend of mine  
You off up in my head, its just a matter of time  
Before I rip shit apart and let Sean Paul shine  
Like dem' folks open face off in yo' grill  
I ain't tryin' to be greedy, I'm just tryin' to live  
Now that the picture clear, and you know what I mean  
Being broke all again slick it's just a dream

Youngbloodz, streetboy  
Now everybody pull ya' whips out, get 'em shined up  
Hit the mirror make sure ya' boy leaned up  
Brush up out the clean up, ya' team freezed up

Walkin' up in the V.I.P., I.M.P. when I walked by  
Man, I, don't holla at no lame ho's
