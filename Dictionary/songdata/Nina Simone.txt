Nina simone, gilbert o'sullivan  
  
I remember this afternoon  
When my sister came into the room  
She refused to say how my father was  
But i knew he'd be dying soon.  
  
And i was oh so glad, and it was oh so sad  
That i realized that i despised this man i once called father.  
In his hanging on, with fingers clutching  
His body now just eighty-eight pounds  
Blinded eyes still searching  
For some distant dream that had faded away at the seams.  
Dying alone, naturally.  
  
I was his favourite child, i had him a little while  
Just as long as i could play the piano and smile a little smile  
Just when i needed him most, he was already a ghost  
And for all my life there where promises and they always have been broken  
  
Leaving me alone with all my troubles  
Not ever once touching me and saying  
"daugther, i'll help you get over."  
Now he's fadig away and i'm glad to say,  
He's dying at last. naturally.  
  
It's a very sad thing to see that my mother with all her heart  
Believes the words that the bible said "til death do us two part".  
For her that was forever and ay, he decided her night and day  
How could some english words so small affect someone so strangely?  
  
Taking her away from us, her soul included  
She might es well be gone with him, all the children are excluded.  
Loneliness is hell, i know so well,  
For i'm alone. naturally.  
  
I waited three weeks for him to die  
I waited three weeks for him to die  
Every night he was calling on me  
I wouldn't go to him.  
I waited three weeks for him to die  
Three weeks for him to die.  
  
And after he died, after he died  
Every night i went out, every night i had a flight.  
It didn't matter who it was with  
'cos i knew what it was about.  
And if you could read between lines, my dad and i close as flies.  
I loved him then and i loved him still, that's why my heart's so broken.  
  
Leaving me to doubt god in his mercy  
And if he really does exist then why does he desert me?  
When he passed away i smoked and drank all day,  
Alone. again. naturally.  

Old people talk to themselves  
When they sit all 'round all day  
This old woman I knew  
I used to go over there and sit with her  
And she'd be sitting around  
In a rocking chair talking to herself  
  
And she used to say she used to say  
Sometimes the cold gets in my bones so bad  
Till I just don't think I can go  
Yeah and for a little while well I don't care  
If my days are coming to an end  
And just as soon be gone sometimes  
  
Sometimes the night comes down on me  
And I know what's ahead  
An evening in this cold old house  
With no one to say goodnight to me when I go to bed  
An evening in this cold old house  
With no one to say goodnight to me when I go to bed  
  
Sometimes  
I wonder why I stay  
What am I waiting for  
My children are grown and gone away  
They got children of their own now  
Don't need me anymore  
  
In winter when the streets are bare  
There ain't nothing much to see  
I just can't help missing and thinking  
About that kindly man  
That one old winter time came  
And took away from me  
  
And then one morning  
Another spring is there outside my door  
Things are blooming  
Birds are singing  
And suddenly yes well I ain't sad  
Ain't sad no more ain't sad no more  
  
When it's warm and the sun is out  
It's like my heart's restored  
I've had my love I've had my children  
And I have so many memories  
So don't mind me complaining  
What the years may bring  
  
Cos this old world has been fine with me really  
And I'm thankful for seeing another spring  
It's gonna be better this time another spring  
It's gonna be groovier this time another spring  
It's what's happening this time  
So I'm thankful for letting me see another spring

Mr. Backlash, Mr. Backlash  
Just who do think I am  
You raise my taxes, freeze my wages  
And send my son to Vietnam  
  
You give me second class houses  
And second class schools  
Do you think that alla colored folks  
Are just second class fools  
Mr. Backlash, I'm gonna leave you  
With the backlash blues  
  
When I try to find a job  
To earn a little cash  
All you got to offer  
Is your mean old white backlash  
But the world is big  
Big and bright and round  
And it's full of folks like me  
Who are black, yellow, beige and brown  
Mr. Backlash, I'm gonna leave you  
With the backlash blues  
  
Mr. Backlash, Mr. Backlash  
Just what do you think I got to lose  
I'm gonna leave you  
With the backlash blues

Not me, just wait and see  

Hollis Brown  
He lived on the outside of town  
Hollis Brown  
He lived on the outside of town  
With his wife and five children  
And his cabin broken down  
Where you looked for work and money  
And you walked a rugged mile  
You looked for work and money  
And you walked a rugged mile  
Your children are so hungry  
That they don't know how to smile  
Your baby's eyes look crazy  
They're a-tuggin' at your sleeve  
Your baby's eyes look crazy  
They're a-tuggin' at your sleeve  
You walk the floor and wonder why  
With every breath you breathe  
The rats have got your flour  
Bad blood it got your mare  
The rats have got your flour  
Bad blood it got your mare  
Is there anyone who knows?  
Is there anyone who cares?  
So you prayed to the Lord above  
Please send you a friend  
Yes you prayed to the Lord above  
Please send you a friend  
But your empty pockets tell you  
That you ain't got no friends  
Your babies are cryin' louder now  
It's poundin' in your brain  
Your babies are cryin' louder now  
It's poundin' in your brain  
Your wife's screams are stabbin' you  
Like the dirty drivin' rain  
Your grass is turnin' black  
There's no water in your well  
Your grass is turnin' black  
There's no water in your well  
You spent your last dollar  
On seven shotgun shells  
Way out in the wilderness  
A cold coyote calls  
Way out in the wilderness  
A cold coyote calls  
Your eyes fix on the shotgun  
That's hangin' on the wall  
Your brain is a-bleedin' now  
Your legs can't seem to stand  
Your brain is a-bleedin' now  
Your legs can't seem to stand  
Your eyes fix on the shotgun  
That you're holdin' in your hand  
There's seven breezes blowin'  
All around the cabin door  
There's seven breezes blowin'  
All around the cabin door  
Seven shots ring out  
Like the ocean's poundin' roar  
There's seven people dead  
On a south Dakota farm  
There's seven people dead  
On a south Dakota farm  
Somewhere in the distance  
Seven new people are born  

Beat-up little seagull  
On a marble stair  
Tryin' to find the ocean  
Lookin' everywhere  
  
Hard times in the city  
In a hard town by the sea  
Ain't nowhere to run to  
There ain't nothin' here for free  
  
Hooker on the corner  
Waitin' for a train  
Drunk lyin' on the sidewalk  
Sleepin' in the rain

Let me sigh, let me cry when I'm blue,  
Let me go away from this lonely town,  
Won't be long till my sun will be blue,  
Cause I know I'm on my last go round.  
All the love I could steal, beg or borrow,  
Wouldn't heal all the pain in my soul.  
  
What is love? Only a prelude to sorrow,  
With a heartbreak ahead for your goal,  
Here I go, now you know why I'm leaving.  
Got the blues. What can I lose? Goodbye!

Just take a look  
At your great big hands  
You know you can crush  
Poor me in two  
But gentle, oh so gentle  
Are the things you do  
  
I say i never have to worry  
'bout you goin' out  
There ain't no other woman  
Ain't no need to doubt  
So early to bed  
And early to rise  
I know just what you're thinkin'  
Bye the look in your eyes  
  
I say buck  
So sweet is your back  
I like to wash you  
And kiss you when you're wet  
So hold me close  
And squeeze me till i sigh  
Please love me, honey  
Till the day i die  
  
I say buck  
There ain't no other man around  
Get your lover gal  
To calm right down

I feel for you  
So gentle, oh so gentle  
Are the things you do  
Oh so gentle, oh so gentle

Oh so gentle, oh so gentle

All day long before my eyes come little visions of you,  
They shouldn't, they mustn't, but they do.  
Can't get out of this mood,  
Can't get over this feeling,  
Can't get out of this mood,  
  
Last night your lips were appealing,  
The thrill should have been all gone by today, in the usual way,  
But it's only your arms that I'm out of.  
Can't get out of this dream  
What a fool to dream of you,  
Twasn't part of my scheme to sigh and tell you that I love you,  
But now I'm saying it, I'm playing it dumb,  
Can't get out of this mood,  
Heartbreak here I come.  
  
I can't get over this feeling,  
Last night your lips were appealing,  
The thrill should have been all gone by today, in the usual way,  
But it's only your arms that I'm out of.  
What a fool to dream of you,  
To sigh and tell you that I love you,  
But now I'm playing it, now I'm playing it dumb,  
I can't get out of this mood,  
Heartbreak, heartbreak here I come.

Cherish is the word I use to describe  
All the feeling that I have hiding here for you inside  
You don't know how many times I've wished that I had told you  
You don't know how many times I've wished that I could hold you  
You don't know how many times I've wished that I could  
Mold you into someone who could  
Cherish me as much as I cherish you  
Perish is the word that more than applies  
To the hope in my heart each time I realize  
That I am not gonna be the one to share your dreams  
That I am not gonna be the one to share your schemes  
That I am not gonna be the one to share what  
Seems to be the life that you could  
Cherish as much as I do yours  
Oh I'm beginning to think that man has never found  
The words that could make you want me  
That have the right amount of letters, just the right sound  
That could make you hear, make you see  
That you are drivin' me out of my mind  
Oh I could say I need you but then you'd realize  
That I want you just like a thousand other girls  
Who'd say they loved you With all the rest of their lies  
When all they wanted was to touch your face, your hands  
And gaze into your eyes  
Cherish is the word I use to describe  
All the feeling that I have hiding here for you inside  
You don't know how many times I've wished that I had told you  
You don't know how many times I've wished that I could hold you  
You don't know how many times I've wished that I could  
Mold you into someone who could  
Cherish me as much as I cherish you  
And I do cherish you  
And I do cherish you  
Cherish is the word

When you like a fellow  
Try to treat him right  
Give him your attention  
Day and Night  
  
When he starts to smilin'  
And he's got you uptight  
Shower him with kisses  
Day and night  
  
Tell him how you love him  
Tell him he's out of sight  
Then he'll know you dig him  
Day and night  
  
If he wants to leave you  
And you think he might  
Beg him not to leave you  
Day and night  
  
Tell him that you're lonely  
Tell him that you're cold  
Tell him that you need him  
Here to (Satisfy your soul)  
  
If he likes to dance now  
Tell you what you do  
When you see him comin' down the street  
You start to (Do the bungaloo)  
  
Oh no, even when he's wrong  
Tell him that he's righr  
You can take the blame  
Both day and night

Do I move you, are you willin'  
Do I groove you, is it thrillin'  
Do I soothe you, tell the truth now  
Do I move you, are you loose now  
The answer better be (Yes, yes)  
That pleases me  
  
Are you ready for this action  
Does it give you satisfaction  
Are you hip to what I'm sayin'  
If you are then let's start swayin'

Form your head down to your liver  
If you like it let me know it  
Don't be psychic or you'll blow it  
The answer better be (Yes, yes)  
That pleases me  

Someone told someone and someone told you  
But they wouldn't hurt you, not much  
Since everyone spread the story  
With his own little personal touch  
  
Do nothin' till you hear from me  
Pay no attention to what's said  
Why people tear the seam of anyone's dream  
Is over my head  
Do nothin' till you hear from me  
At least consider our romance  
If you should take the word of others you've heard  
I haven't a chance  
True I've been seen with someone new  
But does that mean that I'm untrue  
When we're apart the words in my heart  
Reveal how I feel about you  
Some kiss may cloud my memory  
And other arms may hold a thrill  
But please do nothin' till you hear it from me  
And you never will  
Do nothin' till you hear from me  
  
Do nothin' till you hear from me  
Pay no attention to what's said  
Why people tear the seam of anyone's dream  
Is over my head  
Do nothin' till you hear from me  
At least consider our romance  
If you should take the word of others you've heard  
I haven't a chance  
True I've been seen with someone new  
But does that mean that I'm untrue  
When we're apart the words in my heart  
Reveal how I feel about you  
Some kiss may cloud my memory  
And other arms may hold a thrill  
But please do nothin' till you hear it from me  
And you never will  

Baby you understand me now  
If sometimes you see that I'm mad  
Doncha know that no one alive can always be an angel?  
When everything goes wrong you see some bad  
  
Well I'm just a soul whose intentions are good  
Oh lord, please don't let me be misunderstood  
  
Ya know sometimes baby I'm so carefree  
With a joy that's hard to hide  
Then sometimes again it seems that all I have is worry  
And then you burn to see my other side  
  
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good  
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood  
  
If I seem edgy  
I want you to know  
I never meant to take it out on you  
Life has it's problems  
And I get more than my share  
But that's one thing I never mean to do  
  
'Cause I love you  
Oh baby  
I'm just human  
Don't you know I have faults like anyone?  
  
Sometimes I find myself alone regretting  
Some little foolish thing  
Some simple thing that I've done  
  
Cause I'm just a soul whose intentions are good  
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood  
  
Don't let me be misunderstood I try so hard  
So please don't let me be misunderstood

It's true who cares what they do? Cause I don't need anyone but you. Just you  
And me, we're gonna make it all alone. Let them laugh at us, we're gonna build  
A world all our own, Keep on then, keep on holdin on to me,they'll learn in  
Time. I really love you, so don't you pay em' no mind. You know I love you,
you  
Know I can't be without you  
  

This is the end of the line  
I've clearly read ever sign  
The way you glance at me  
Indifferently  
And take your hand from mine  
This is the end of the line  
How can I ever be fine  
How helpless I've become  
I feel like some discarded valentine  
Remember in the biginniunfg  
Your winning ways excited me  
And all the while I was certain  
That we two found a love that comes just to a few  
We've reached the end of the line  
I hope your dreams turn out fine  
I'm awfully tired  
And so I guess I'll go  
Although it's only nine  
But this is the end of the line  
The end of the line

Streets full of people, all alone  
Roads full of houses, never home  
A church full of singing, out of tune  
Everyone's gone to the moon  
Eyes full of sorrow, never wet  
Hands full of money, all in debt  
Sun coming out in the middle of June  
Everyone's gone to the moon  
You see a long time ago, life had begun  
Everyone went to the sun  
Parks full of motors, painted green  
Mouths full of chocolate-covered cream  
Arms that can only lift a spoon  
You see everyone's gone, everybody's gone  
Everyone's gone to the moon  
Everyone's gone to the moon  
What will happen now?  
Everyone's gone to the moon  
There's nobody left  
Everyone's gone to the moon  

everything must change  
nothing stays the same  
everyone will change  
no one, no one stays the same  
  
the young become the old  
and mysteries do unfold  
for that's the way of time  
no one, and nothing goes unchanged  
  
there are not many things in life one can be sure of  
except rain comes from the clouds  
sun lights up the sky  
hummingbirds fly  
  
winter turns to spring  
a wounded heart will heal  
oh but never much too soon  
no one, and nothing goes unchanged  
  
The young become the old  
and mysteries do unfold  
for that's the way of time  
no one, and nothing stays unchanged  
  
there are not many things in life one can be sure of  
except rain comes from the clouds  
sun lights up the sky  
hummingbirds fly  
  
rain comes from the clouds  
sun lights up the sky  
hummingbirds fly  
  
rain comes from the clouds  
sun lights up the sky  
hummingbirds fly  
  
everything must change  
  
  

Falling in love again I never wanted to  
What am I to do I can't help it  
Love has always been my game play it how I may  
I was made that way I can't help it  
  
Men cluster to me like moths around a flame  
And if their wings burn I know I'm not to blame  
Falling in love again I never wanted to  
What am I to do I can't help it  
  
Men cluster to me like moths around a flame  
And if their wings burn I know I'm not to blame  
Falling in love again I never wanted to  
What am I to do I can't help it

My man he don't love me he treats me oh so mean  
My man he don't love me he treats me oh so mean

Cos without your loving I swear I'm gonna lose my mind

Someday we'll build a home on a hilltop high,  
You and I,  
Shiny and new a cottage that two can fill.  
And we'll be pleased to be called,  
"The folks who live on the hill".  
  
Someday we may be adding a thing or two,  
A wing or two.  
We will make changes as any fam'ly will,  
But we will always be called,  
"The folks who live on the hill".  
  
Our veranda will command a view of meadows green,  
The sort of view that seems to want to be seen.  
And when the kids grow up and leave us,  
We'll sit and look at the same old view,  
Just we two.  
  
Darby and Joan who used to be Jack and Jill,  
The folks like to be called,  
What they have always been called,  
"The folks who live on the hill".

Lost in day to day  
Turned another way  
With a laugh, a kind hello  
Some small talk with those I know  
I forget that I'm not over you  
For a while  
  
A wave an easy grin  
A smile to put them in  
With other lives to listen to  
And some work I've got to do  
I forget that I'm not over you  
For a while  
  
Days go by with no empty feeling  
Until I remember you're gone  
  
People say to me, you need company  
When you have some time to spend  
Drop around and meet a friend  
They forget that I'm not over you  
For a while  
They forget that I'm not over you  
For a while

For all we know  
We may never meet again  
Before we go  
Make this moment live again  
We won't say goodbye  
Until the last minute  
I'll hold out my hand  
And my heart will be in it  
  
For all we know  
This might only be a dream  
We come and we go  
Like the ripples, like the ripples in the stream  
So baby, love me, love me tonight  
Tomorrow was made for some  
Oh, but tomorrow  
But tomorrow may never, never come  
For all we know  
Yes, tomorrow may never, never come  
For all we know

Eve and Adam had a garden everything was great  
Till one day a boy says pardon Miss my name is snake  
See that apple over yonder if you'll take a bite  
You and Adam both are bound to have some fun tonight  
Go on and eat forbidden fruit  
It's mighty sweet forbidden fruit  
It's quite a treat forbidden fruit  
Go ahead and taste it you don't wanna waste it  
  
The Lord had said in the beginning everything is free  
Except that apple that leads to sinning so let that apple be  
But Eve got tempted so she tried it and as all chicks do  
Teaser her man till he decided he'd just try some too  
Go on and eat forbidden fruit  
It's mighty sweet forbidden fruit  
It's quite a treat forbidden fruit  
Go ahead and bite it I bet you'd be delighted  
  
I hate to tell you all what followed the Lord was most upset  
Saw them making love and hollered what have you to add  
And when they made a full confession the Lord said hm I see  
I guess I'll have to teach you a lesson about not minding me  
Go on and eat forbidden fruit  
It's mighty sweet forbidden fruit  
It's quite a treat forbidden fruit  
You're all indebted now you gonna get it  
  
The Lord made Eve Adam's madam have his kids and all  
Placed some labor laws on Adam and he made the snake to fall  
Ever since the days of Eden folks been sinful my  
Nowadays they're even eating apples in their pie  
Go on and eat forbidden fruit  
It's mighty sweet forbidden fruit  
It's quite a treat forbidden fruit  
Go ahead and taste it you don't wanna waste it  
Oh go ahead and bite it I bet you'd be delighted  
You always did it now you'll gonna get it  
Forbidden fruit

My skin is black  
My arms are long  
My hair is woolly  
My back is strong  
Strong enough to take the pain  
Inflicted again and again  
What do they call me  
My name is AUNT SARAH  
My name is Aunt Sarah  
  
My skin is yellow  
My hair is long  
Between two worlds  
I do belong  
My father was rich and white  
He forced my mother late one night  
What do they call me  
My name is SAFFRONIA  
My name is Saffronia  
  
My skin is tan  
My hair is fine  
My hips invite you  
My mouth like wine  
Whose little girl am I?  
Anyone who has money to buy  
What do they call me  
My name is SWEET THING  
My name is Sweet Thing  
  
My skin is brown  
My manner is tough  
I'll kill the first mother I see  
My life has been too rough  
I'm awfully bitter these days  
Because my parents were slaves  
What do they call me  
My name is PEACHES

You're nothing but a dirty, dirty old man  
You do your thinking with a one track mind  
Keep talkin' about heaven glory but  
On your face is a different story  
Clean up your rap your story's getting dusty  
Wash out your mouth  
Your lies are getting rusty  
Can't believe nothing you say  
'cause I'm around and I see what you do  
You know you're funky as a mosquito's tweeter  
You gotta mouth like a herd of boll weevils  
Same old game, same old thing  
You never changed  
Always rappin 'bout the same old thing  
  
I got something to tell ya  
I got something to tell you baby  
But you ain't hip to baby  
Blowin' minds is a thing of the past  
You blew your chance that's why you never last  
You want to be a graduate mother  
But in reality just another brother  
You think you slick but could  
Stand a lot of greasing  
The things you do ain't never really pleasin'  
Can't believe nothin' you say  
'Cause I'm around and I see what you do  
You know you funky as a mosquito's tweeter  
You got a mouth like a herd of boll weevils  
Same old game, same old thing  
Always rappin 'bout the same old thing  
You beautiful, beautiful  
Beautiful, beautiful  
  
Brought yourself a pot of baked stew  
Nothin' worse than an educated fool  
Talkin' sex is your favorite conversation  
But peace and love is a famous generation  
What's in your head has really started  
Showing your conversation gettin' kinda boring  
Can't believe nothin' you say  
'Cause I'm around and I see what you do  
You know you funky as a mosquito's tweeter  
You got a mouth like a herd of boll weevils  
Same old game, same old game  
Same old thing you never change  
Same old game, same old thing  
Always rappin' 'bout the same old thing

Up in Harlem on a Saturday night  
Where the highbrows get together, it's just too tight  
We all gather at the Harlem Strut  
And what we do is tut tut tut  
Ol' Hannah Brown, from way cross town  
Keeps drinking her liquor and she brings them down  
Just at the break of day  
You could hear old Hannah say  
I wanna pigfoot and a bottle of beer  
Send me daddy, 'cause I don't care  
I feel just like I wanna clown  
Give the piano player a drink  
'Cause he brought me down  
He's got rhythm when he stomps his feet  
He just send me right off to sleep  
Check all your razors and check your guns  
I'm gonna be arrested when the wagon comes  
I wanna pigfoot and a bottle of beer  
Send me 'cause I don't care oh no  
Send me 'cause I don't care  
I wanna pigfoot and a bottle of beer  
Send me daddy, 'cause I don't care  
I feel just like I wanna clown  
Give the piano player a drink  
Cause he brought me down  
He's got rhythm when he stomps his feet  
He just send me right off to sleep  
Check all your razors and check your guns  
I'm gonna be arrested when the wagon comes  
I wanna pigfoot and a bottle of beer  
Send me 'cause I don't care oh no  
Send me 'cause I don't care  

Oh Daughter, dear Daughter,  
Take warning from me  
And don't you go marching  
With the N-A-A-C-P.  
  
For they'll rock you and roll you  
And shove you into bed.  
And if they steal your nuclear secret  
You'll wish you were dead.  
  
[Chorus]  
Singin' too roo la, too roo la, too roo li ay.  
Singin' too roo la, too roo la, too roo li ay.  
  
Oh Mother, dear Mother,  
No, I'm not afraid.  
For I'll go on that march  
And I'll return a virgin maid.  
  
With a brick in my handbag  
And a smile on my face  
And barbed wire in my underwear  
To shed off disgrace.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
One day they were marching.  
A young man came by  
With a beard on his cheek  
And a gleam in his eye.  
  
And before she had time  
To remember her brick...  
They were holding a sit-down  
On a nearby hay rig.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
For meeting is pleasure  
And parting is pain.  
And if I have a great concert  
Maybe I won't have to sing those folk songs again.  
  
Oh Mother, dear Mother  
I'm stiff and I'm sore  
From sleeping three nights  
On a hard classroom floor.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
One day at the briefing  
She'd heard a man say,  
"Go perfectly limp,  
And be carried away."  
  
So when this young man suggested  
It was time she was kissed,  
She remembered her brief  
And did not resist.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh Mother, dear Mother,  
No need for distress,  
For the young man has left me  
His name and address.  
  
And if we win  
Tho' a baby there be,  
He won't have to march  
Like his da-da and me.

Now if your mind lies in the Devil's workshop  
And evil-doin's your thrill  
And trouble and mischief is all you live for  
You know darn well  
That you'll go to Hell  
  
So you're living high and mighty  
Rich off the fat of the land  
Just don't dispose of your natural soul  
'Cause you know darn well  
That you'll go to Hell  
  
I say Hell  
Where your natural soul burns  
Hell  
Where you pay for your sins  
Hell  
Keep your children from wrong-doing  
'Cause you know darn well  
That they'll go to Hell.  
  
I say Hell  
Man, woman were created  
Hell  
To live for eternity  
Hell  
With an apple they ate from the tree of hate  
So you know darn well  
That they went to Hell.  
  
Now Satan was an angel in Heaven  
But he stirred up trouble and woe  
So the Lord commanded that the Devil be branded  
So you know darn well  
He went to Hell  
Yeah, he went to Hell  
Yeah, he went to Hell  
He went to Hell.

Oh stairs ... you look so high tonight  
CLIMBIN' UP with all my might  
Where I got no heart to be  
'Cause he ain't comin' home no more.  
  
Oh room ... I'm all alone with you  
Tell me what's a women to do  
When her man is gone  
And he ain't comin' home no more.  
  
I'm all choked up ... inside me  
Try'na hold back my tears  
You know ... I just can't GET USED  
I just can't USED TO this loneliness  
How AM I gonna face the empty years.  
  
Oh chair ... Oh chair  
You sittin' silent there  
Don't you even care  
That my baby's gone ... yea, yea  
And he ain't comin' home no more  
  
Yes ... for my baby's gone  
And he ain't comin' home no more  

No one seems to care as much  
No time to smile, laugh or cry as much  
Have we lost the touch that means so much  
Have we lost the human touch  
  
No one wants to be alone  
To walk or talk and sleep and weep alone  
Have we lost the touch that does so much  
Have we lost the human touch  
  
Touch me now and let me know  
Hold me tight so i can go  
Through this misery unafraid  
And really knowin' what lift is all about  
  
No one wants to live alone  
Who wants to smile, laugh or cry alone  
Have we lost the touch that means so much  
Have we lost the human touch  
Yes, yes, yes

Hush, little baby, don't say a word,  
Papa's gonna buy you a mockingbird.  
  
And if that mockingbird don't sing,  
Papa's gonna buy you a diamond ring.  
  
And if that diamond ring turn brass,  
Papa's gonna buy you a looking glass.  
  
And if that looking glass gets broke,  
Papa's gonna buy you a billy goat.  
  
And if that billy goat don't pull,  
Papa's gonna buy you a cart and bull.  
  
And if that cart and bull turn over,  
Papa's gonna buy you a dog named Rover.  
  
And if that dog named Rover won't bark.  
Papa's gonna to buy you and horse and cart.  
  
And if that horse and cart fall down,  
Well you'll still be the sweetest little baby in town.

I who never had much I now have a treasure  
A love too great to measure  
I am blessed with happiness  
And I'm done with loneliness  
  
I who walked all alone not really knowing  
Till now just where I was going  
I am blessed because this day  
You came show me the way  
  
Till now I was like a grain of sand  
Lost on a lonely beach  
Yes till now I could never understand  
That this was within my reach  
  
I who cried to the moon see only sunshine  
Because darling you're mine  
I am blessed with wealth untold  
A love worth more than gold

(1952) hoagy carmichael  
  
I get along without you very well  
Of course, i do  
Except when soft rains fall  
And drip from leaves then i recall  
The thrill of being sheltered  
In your arms  
Of course, i do  
But i get along without you very well  
  
I've forgotten you  
Just like i said i would  
Of course, i have  
Or maybe except when i hear your name  
Someone's laugh that's just the same  
I've forgotten you just like  
I should  
  
What a guy  
What a fool am i  
To think my aching hearth  
Could keep the moon  
What's in store  
Should i phone once more  
No, no, no, no, no  
It's best that i stick to my tune  
  
I said that i get along  
Without you very well  
Of course, i do  
Except perhaps in spring  
But then i should never  
Ever think of spring  
For that would  
Surely break my heart in two

My baby never treats me  
Sweet and gentle  
The way he should  
I got it bad and that ain't good  
No, that ain't good  
My poor heart is sentimental  
Not made of wood  
'Cause I've got it bad and that ain't good  
And when the weekend's over  
And Monday rolls around  
I end up like I start out  
Just cryin' my heart out  
Lord above me  
Make him love me  
The way he should  
The way he should  
Because I've got it so bad and that ain't good  
I got it bad and that ain't good  

I loves you Porgy  
Don't let him take me  
Don't let him handle me  
And drive me mad  
If you can keep me, I wants to stay here  
With you forever and I'd be glad  
I loves you Porgy  
Don't let him take me  
Don't let him handle me  
With his hot hand  
If you can keep me, I wants to stay here  
With you forever  
I got my man  
  
Someday, I know he's comin' back  
To call me  
He's gonna handle me and hold me so  
It's gonna be like dyin', Porgy,  
Deep inside me,  
But when he calls I know I have to go  
  
Porgy, I's your woman now  
I is, I is  
And I ain't never goin' nowhere  
'Less you shares the fun  
Want no wrinkle on your brow,  
No how  
Because the sorrow of the past is all  
Done, done  
My Porgy,  
Now the real happiness is just begun  
There's no wrinkle on my brow  
No how  
And I ain't goin'  
You hear me saying, if you ain't goin',  
With you I'm stayin'  
  
Porgy, I's yo' woman now,  
I's yours forever  
Mornin' time and evenin' time  
And summer time and winter time  
Mmm  
Oh my Porgy  
My man Porgy  
From this minute I'm tellin' you,  
I keep this vow  
Porgy, I's yo' woman now!

By Jay Hawkins  
Performed by Marilyn Manson:  
I put a spell on you  
Because you're mine.  
I can't stand the things that you do.  
No, no, no, I ain't lyin'. No.  
I don't care if you don't want me  
'Cause I'm yours, yours, yours anyhow.  
Yeah, I'm yours, yours, yours.  
I love you. I love you.  
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!  
I put a spell on you.  
Lord! Lord! Lord!  
....'Cause you're mine, yeah.  
I can't stand the things that you do  
When you're foolin' around.  
I don't care if you don't want me.  
'Cause I'm yours, yours, yours anyhow.  
Yeah, yours, yours, yours!  
I can't stand your foolin' around.  
If I can't have you,  
No one will!

I love you, you, you!  
I don't care if you don't want me.  
'Cause I'm yours, yours, yours anyhow.

They say everything can be replaced  
Yet every distance is not near  
So I remember every face  
Of every man who put me here  
  
I see the light come shining  
From the west unto the east  
Any day now any day now  
I shall be released  
  
They say every man needs protection  
They say every man must fall  
Yet I swear I see my reflection  
Some place too high above this wall  
  
Now yonder standing me in this lonely crowd  
A man who swears he's not to blame  
ALl day long I hear his voice shouting so loud  
Crying out that he was framed  
  
I see the light come shining  
From the west unto the east  
Any day now any day now  
I shall be released

I sing just to know that I'm alive  
I play just to feel that I'll survive  
And if there's a second place  
Where ?????????? just the case  
I sing just to know that I'm alive  
Sugoose, Yeah Sugoose, Sugoose, Yeah Sugoose, Sugoose, Yeah Sugoose  
Well the mountains they won't move no they don't  
And the people they won't dance and they won't  
I sing, I sing, I sing, I sing,  
I sing just to know that I'm alive.  
  

Broken windows and empty hallways  
A pale dead moon in the sky streaked with gray  
Human kindness is overflowing  
And I think it's going to rain today  
  
Scarecrows dressed in the latest styles  
With frozen smiles to chase love away  
Human kindness is overflowing  
And I think it's going to rain today  
  
Lonely, lonely  
Tin can at my feet  
Think I'll kick it down the street  
That's the way to treat a friend  
  
Bright before me the signs implore me  
To help the needy and show them the way  
Human kindness is overflowing  
And I think it's going to rain today

I wish I knew how  
It would feel to be free  
I wish I could break  
All the chains holding me  
I wish I could say  
All the things that I'd like to say  
Say 'em loud say 'em clear  
For the whole round world to hear  
I wish I could share  
All the love that's in my heart  
Remove every doubt  
It keeps us apart  
And I wish you could know  
What it means to be me  
Then you'd see and agree  
Every man should be free  
  
I wish I could live  
  
Like I'm longin' to live  
I wish I could give  
What I'm longin' to give  
And I wish I could do  
All the things I'd like to do  
You know they'll still miss part of you  
Yes sir  
And I'm way way over due  
  
I wish I could be like a bird up in the sky  
How sweet it would be  
If I found out I could fly  
So long to my song  
And look down upon the sea  
And I sing because I know  
I would see you  
I sing because I know  
I would see you  
And I sing because I know  
I would see you  
To be free, yeah

I told Jesus it would be alright if He changed my name  
I told Jesus it would be alright if He changed my name  
I told Jesus it would be alright if He changed my name  
And He told me that I would go hungry if He changed my name  
And He told me that I would go hungry if He changed my name  
And He told me that I would go hungry if He changed my name  
  
But I told Jesus it would be alright if He changed my name  
I told Jesus it would be alright if He changed my name  
So I told Him it would be alright and the world would hate me  
That I would go hungry if He changed my name

If you knew how I missed you  
You would not stay away today  
Don't you know I need you  
Stay here my dear with me  
  
I need you here my darling  
Together for a day a day  
Together never parting  
Just you just me my love  
  
I can't go on without you  
Your love is all I'm living for  
I love all things about you  
Your heart your soul my love  
  
I need you here beside me  
Forever and a day a day  
I know whatever betides me  
I love you I love you I do

I'll look around  
And when I've found me somebody who laughs like you  
I know somewhere spring must fill the air with sweetness  
Just as rare as a flower that you gave me to wear  
  
So I'll look around  
Sweetheart and when I've found me somebody  
Somebody who laughs like you  
I'll know this love that I've been dreaming of  
And it won't be the old love that I always knew  
  
Mmm who laughs like you  
I know somewhere spring must fill the air with sweetness  
Just as rare as a flower that you gave me to wear  
  
So I'll look around  
And when I've found me somebody who laughs like you  
I'll know this love that I've been dreaming of  
And it won't be the old love that I always knew

I'm gonna leave you yes I'm gonna  
I'm gonna leave you 'cause I want to  
And I'll go where people love me  
And I'll stay there 'cause they love me  
  
No more headaches no more heartbreaks

And I put up with all your fussin'  
And I waited getting frustrated

And I waited getting frustrated  
  
I'm old fashioned I want my passion  
So I'm leaving through I'm greaving  
I'm gonna leave you where I met you

In the dark  
It's just you and I  
Not a sound  
Ther's not one sigh  
Just the beet of my poor heart  
In the dark  
  
Now, in the dark, in the dark  
I get such a thrill  
When he presses his fingertips  
Upon my lips  
And he begs me to plase keep still  
In the dark  
  
But soon  
This dance will be endin'  
And you're gonna be missed  
Gee, I'm not pretendin'  
'Cause I swear it's fun  
Fun to be kissed  
  
In the dark  
Now we will find  
What the rest  
Have left behind  
Just let them dance  
We're gonna find romance  
Lord, in the dark

In the evening by the moonlight  
When my mother had finished working  
We used to sit around the fire place  
Till the cornbread it was done  
And then we all would eat our supper  
After that we'd clean the kitchen  
It's the only time they ever gave us to spare  
To have a little fun  
Then my daddy used to take his fiddle down  
That hung upon the wall  
While the silvery moon was shining clear and bright  
How the folks would enjoy it  
They would sit all night and listen  
As we used to sing in the evening by the moonlight  
  
In the evening by the moonlight  
You could hear banjos ringing  
You could hear them by the moonlight  
You could hear my folks all singing  
How my mother she would enjoy it  
She would sit all night and listen  
As we sang in the evening by the moolight oh yeah  
  
In the evening by the moonlight  
You could hear folks all singing  
In the evening by the moonlight  
You could hear my folks all singing  
How my mother she would enjoy it  
She would sit all night and listen  
As we sang in the evening by the moolight oh yeah  
  
In the evening by the moonlight  
You could hear banjos ringing  
In the evening by the moonlight  
You could hear my folks all singing  
How my mother she would enjoy it  
She would sit all night and listen

Isn't it a pity  
You don't know what I'm talking about yet  
But I'm gonna tell you soon  
It's a pity  
Isn't it a pity  
Isn't it a shame  
Yes, how we break each other's hearts  
And cause each other pain  
How we take each other's love  
Without thinking anymore  
Forgetting to give back, forgetting to remember  
Just forgetting a note of thank you  
Isn't it a pity  
Some things take so long  
But how do I explain  
Why not too many people can see that we are all just the same  
We're all guilty  
Because all the tears  
Our eyes just can't hope to see  
But I don't think it's applicable to me  
The beauty that surrounds them  
Child, isn't it a pity  
How we take each other's love  
The most precious thing without thinking anymore  
Forgetting to give back, forgetting to keep open the door  
But I understand some things take so long  
But how do I explain  
Why not too many people can see, we're just the same  
And because of all their tears  
Their eyes can't hope to see  
The beauty that surrounds them  
God, isn't it a pity  
The beauty that surrounds them  
It's a pity  
The beauty that surrounds them  
It's a pity  
The beauty that surrounds us  
And we don't see it  
We think things are just the same  
We've been programmed that way  
Isn't it a pity  
If you want to feel sorry  
Isn't it a pity, isn't it a pity  
The beauty sets the beauty that surrounds us  
Because of all our tears  
Our eyes can't hope to see  
Maybe one day at least I'll see me  
And just concentrate on givin', givin', givin', givin'  
And till that day mankind don't stand a chance  
Don't know nothin' about romance, everything is plastic  
Isn't it a pity  
My God  

When your guy has got his hat, and made himself hard to find  
It doesn? mean you should go crazy, it be? that way sometime  
Find yourself another love who will treat you good and kind  
Return that love he gives to you, it also be? that way sometime  
  
Baby, yes it does  
Baby, yes it does  
Baby, yes it does  
Baby, yes it does  
Baby  
  
When you think you?e found a love and you have peace of mind somebody else  
steals his heart  
Yes it also be? that way sometime  
  
Baby, yes it does  
Baby, yes it does  
Baby, yes it does  
Baby, yes it does  
Baby  
  
Don? let the problems of this world drive you slowly out of your mind  
Just smile look at the problem and say it be? that way sometime  
  
Baby, yes it does  
Baby, yes it does  
Baby, yes it does  
Baby, yes it does  
Baby  
  

The things I used to like, I don't like any more,  
I want a lot of other things I've never had before,  
It's just like my mama says, I sit around and mourn  
Pretending that I am so wonderful and knowing I'm adored  
  
I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm,  
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string,  
I'd say that I had spring fever,  
But I know it isn't spring.  
  
I'm as starry eyed and gravely discontented,  
Like a nightingale without a song to sing.  
Oh, why should I have spring fever,  
When it isn't even spring?  
  
I keep wishing I were somewhere else,  
Walking down a strange new street,  
Hearing words I have never never heard,  
From a man I've yet to meet.  
  
I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams,  
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing,  
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud,  
Or a robin or a bluebird on the wing,  
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way,  
That it might as well be spring,  
It might as well be, might as well be,  
It might as well be spring.

When you're lost in the rain in Juarez  
And it's Easter time too  
And your gravity fails  
And negativity don't pull you through  
  
Don't put on any airs  
When you're down on rue morgue avenue  
They got some hungry women there  
And they really make a mess out of you  
  
Now if you see Saint Annie  
Please tell her thanks a lot  
I cannot move  
My fingers are all in a knot  
  
I don't have the strength  
To get up and take another shot  
And my best friend my doctor  
Won't even say what it is I have got  
  
Sweet Melinda  
The peasants call her the goddess of gloom  
She speaks good English  
And she invites you up into her room  
  
And you're so kind  
And careful not to go to her too soon  
And she takes your voice  
And leaves you howling at the moon  
  
Up on housing project hill  
It's either fortune or fame  
You must pick one or the other  
Though neither of them  
  
Are to be what they claim  
If you're looking to get silly  
You better go back from where you came  
Because the cops don't need you  
And man they expect the same  
  
Now all the authorities  
They just stand around and boast  
Hew they blackmailed the sergeant at arms  
Into leaving his post  
  
And picking up angel who  
Just arrived here from the coast  
Who looked so fine at first  
But left looking like a ghost  
  
I started out on burgundy  
But soon hit the harder stuff  
Everybody said they'd stand behind me  
When the game got rough  
  
But the joke was on me  
There was nobody even there to bluff  
I'm going back to New York City  
I do believe I've had enough

Just say that I need him as roses need the rain  
And tell him that without him my dreams are all in vain  
Just say I love him loved him from the start  
And tell him that I'm yearning to say what's in my heart  
Just say that I need him as roses need the rain  
Tell him that without him my dreams are all in vain  
  
If you should chance to meet him anytime anyplace anywhere  
Say I was a fool to leave him  
Tell him how much a fool can care  
And if he tells you he's lonely now and then  
Just won't you tell him that I love him  
And want him back again  
  
If you should see him anytime anyplace anywhere  
Tell him I was a fool to leave him  
Tell him how much a fool can care  
And if he tells you he's lonely now and then  
Won't you just say I love him and want him back again  
Won't you just say I love him and want him back again

Oh she was a lass from the low country  
And he was a lord of high degree  
But she loved him oh so tenderly  
Oh sorrow sing sorrow  
Now she sleeps in the valley where the wild flowers nod  
No-one knows how she loved him but herself and God  
  
One day when the snow was on the mead  
She passed him by on a milk white steed  
And she spoke to him low nobody paid no need  
Oh sorrow sing sorrow  
Now she sleeps in the valley where the wild flowers nod  
No-one knows how she loved him but herself and God  
  
Now if you be a lass from the low country  
Don't love no man of high degree  
For he don't got a heart or no sympathy  
Oh sorrow sing sorrow  
Now she sleeps in the valley where wild flowers nod  
No-one knows how she loved him but herself and God

'tis the last rose of summer, left blooming all alone  
All her lovely companions are faded and gone.  
No flower of her kindred, no rose bud is nigh  
To reflect back her blushes and give sigh for sigh.  
  
I'll not leave thee, thou lone one! to pine on the stem  
Since the lovely are sleeping, go sleep thou with them  
'thus kindly I scatter thy leaves o'er the bed  
Where thy mates of the garden lie scentless and dead.  
  
So soon may I follow, when friendships decay  
And from love's shining circle the gems drop away  
When true hearts lie wither'd and fond ones are flown  
Oh! who would inhabit this bleak world alone!

I lost myself on a cool damp night  
Gave myself in that misty light  
Was hypnotized by a strange delight  
Under a lilac tree  
I made wine from the lilac tree  
Put my heart in its recipe  
It makes me see what I want to see  
And be what I want to be  
When I think more than I want to think  
Do things I never should do  
I drink much more that I ought to drink  
Because I brings me back you  
  
Lilac wine is sweet and heady, like my love  
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady, like my love  
Listen to me, I cannot see clearly  
Isn't that she coming to me nearly here?  
  
Lilac wine is sweet and heady where's my love?  
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady, where's my love?  
  
Listen to me, why is everything so hazy?  
Isn't that she, or am I just going crazy, dear?  
  
Lilac wine, I feel unready for my love

Sit there and count your fingers  
What can you do  
Old girl you're through  
Sit there, count your little fingers  
Unhappy little girl blue.  
  
Sit there and count the raindrops  
Falling on you  
It's time you knew  
All you can ever count on  
Are the raindrops  
That fall on little girl blue  
  
Won't you just sit there  
Count the little raindrops  
Falling on you  
Cause it's time you knew  
All you can ever count on  
Are the raindrops  
That fall on little girl blue  
  
No use old girl  
You might as well surrender  
Cause your hopes are getting slender and slender  
Why won't somebody send a tender blue boy  
To cheer up little girl blue

Hambone Hammer where you've been

It's only human for anyone to want to be in love  
But who wants to be in love in vain  
At night you hang around the house and weep your heart out  
And cry your eyes out and rack your brain  
  
You say it and wonder, how anyone is wonderful as he  
Could 'cause you such misery and pain  
I thought that I would be in Heaven, but I'm only up a tree  
'Cause it's just my luck to be in love in vain

Love o'love o'love o'love  
Say love o'love o'love o'love  
I had a love so pure so strong  
I keep wondering just where my love went wrong  
My love went wrong  
  
I say why oh why won't love free me  
Why o why won't love love free me  
Oh untie my hands unchain my feet  
And set my poos ol' body free  
  
I... Why must love keep me a slave oh  
Why why must love keep me a slave  
I can't help myself I ain't got no friends  
It will take me take me straight to my grave  
Love will take me straight to my grave  

I love dancing  
Crazy romancing  
Fellas advancing constantly  
  
Marriage is for old folks  
Old folks, not for me!  
One husband  
One wife  
Whaddya got?  
Two people sentenced for life!  
  
I love singing  
Good healthy clinging  
Quietly bringing on a spree  
  
Marriage is for old folks  
Cold folks!  
One married he  
One married she  
Whaddya got?  
Two people watchin' tv!  
  
I'm not ready  
To quit bein' free  
And I'm not willing  
To stop being me  
I've gotta sing my song  
Why should I belong  
To some guy who says  
That I'm wrong?  
  
Doo doo dooo  
De doo de doo  
De-doo de-doo  
Doo doo doo  
Dooo  
  
Cookin' dinner  
Lookin' no thinner  
Gray elbows and  
A sudsy sea  
  
Marriage is for old folks  
Cold folks,  
And it's not for me!  
One husband  
One wife  
Whaddya got?  
Two people sentenced for life!  
  
I'm exploding  
With youth and with zest  
Who needs corroding  
In some vulture's nest?  
I've gotta fly my wings  
Go places, do things  
My freedom bell's really  
Gonna ring!  
  
Doo doo dooo....(etc.)  
  
I've been through years  
Too many blue years  
Now I want New Year's every eve  
  
Marriage is for old folks  
Marriage is for cold folks  
One husband  
One wife  
Whaddya got?  
Two people sentenced for life  
  
Marriage is for old folks  
Marriage is for cold folks  
Not for me  
Can't you see  
Marriage ain't for me

Memphis in June  
A shade veranda under Sunday blue sky  
Memphis in June  
And my cousin Miranda she's making a blueberry pie  
  
I can see the clock outside a ticking and a tocking  
Everything so peaceful and dandy  
I can see my grandmama 'cross the street still a rocking  
Watching all the neighbours go by oh my  
  
Memphis in June  
Sweet oleander blowing perfume in the air everywhere  
Up jumps the moon to make it so much grander  
It's paradise honey take my advice honey  
Cos there's nothing like old Memphis in June

The name of this tune is Mississippi Goddam  
And I mean every word of it  
  
Alabama's gotten me so upset  
Tennessee made me lose my rest  
And everybody knows about Mississippi Goddam  
  
Alabama's gotten me so upset  
Tennessee made me lose my rest  
And everybody knows about Mississippi Goddam  
  
Can't you see it  
Can't you feel it  
It's all in the air  
I can't stand the pressure much longer  
Somebody say a prayer  
  
Alabama's gotten me so upset  
Tennessee made me lose my rest  
And everybody knows about Mississippi Goddam  
  
This is a show tune  
But the show hasn't been written for it, yet  
  
Hound dogs on my trail  
School children sitting in jail  
Black cat cross my path  
I think every day's gonna be my last  
  
Lord have mercy on this land of mine  
We all gonna get it in due time  
I don't belong here  
I don't belong there  
I've even stopped believing in prayer  
  
Don't tell me  
I tell you  
Me and my people just about due  
I've been there so I know  
They keep on saying 'Go slow!'  
  
But that's just the trouble  
'Do it slow'  
Washing the windows  
'Do it slow'  
Picking the cotton  
'Do it slow'  
You're just plain rotten  
'Do it slow'  
You're too damn lazy  
'Do it slow'  
The thinking's crazy  
'Do it slow'  
Where am I going  
What am I doing  
I don't know  
I don't know  
  
Just try to do your very best  
Stand up be counted with all the rest  
For everybody knows about Mississippi Goddam  
  
I made you thought I was kiddin'  
  
Picket lines  
School boy cots  
They try to say it's a communist plot  
All I want is equality  
For my sister my brother my people and me  
  
Yes you lied to me all these years  
You told me to wash and clean my ears  
And talk real fine just like a lady  
And you'd stop calling me Sister Sadie  
  
Oh but this whole country is full of lies  
You're all gonna die and die like flies  
I don't trust you any more  
You keep on saying 'Go slow!'  
'Go slow!'  
  
But that's just the trouble  
'Do it slow'  
Desegregation  
'Do it slow'  
Mass participation  
'Do it slow'  
Reunification  
'Do it slow'  
Do things gradually  
'Do it slow'  
But bring more tragedy  
'Do it slow'  
Why don't you see it  
Why don't you feel it  
I don't know  
I don't know  
  
You don't have to live next to me  
Just give me my equality  
Everybody knows about Mississippi  
Everybody knows about Alabama  
Everybody knows about Mississippi Goddam

My man's gone now  
Ain't no use a listenin'  
For his tired footsteps  
Climbin' up the stairs  
  
Old man sorrow's  
Come to keep me company  
Whisperin' beside me  
When I say my prayers  
When I say my prayers  
  
He come aroud  
He come up, he come around  
Ain't that I mind workin'  
Workin' means travelers  
Journeyin' togheter  
To the promised land  
  
But old man sorrow  
Mountin' all the way with me  
Tell' me that I'm old now  
Since I lose my man  
Since I lose my man  
  
Since I lose my man

Near to you, near to you  
Even though you're far away  
So near to you, always near to you  
As near as April is to may  
Can't you feel me there, in my favourite chair  
Staring at the fireplace?  
Oh so near to you, always near to you  
Even now it seems we're face to face  
But it is just if though I was standing before you  
Telling you how much I adore you  
If I'm really dear to you, near to you  
We may be far apart and yet  
If I'm in your heart, really in your heart  
How near to you can I get  
(2x)  
Oh so near to you, always near to you  
As near as April is to may  
Can't you feel me there, in my favourite chair  
Staring at the fireplace?  
Oh so near to you, always near to you  
Even now it seems we're face to face  
But it is just if though I was standing before you  
Telling you how much I adore you  
If I'm really dear to you, near to you  
We may be far apart and yet  
If I'm in your heart, really in your heart  
How near to you can I get?  
How near to you can I get?  
How near to you, can I get?  
  

  
There's a new world comin'. and it's just around the bend.  
There's a new world comin', this one's comin' to an end.  
There's a new voice callin', you can hear it if you try.  
And its growin' stronger with each day that passes by.  
  
There's a brand new mornin', rising clear and sweet and free.  
There's a new day dawnin', that belongs to you and me.  
Yes, a new world's comin', the one we've had visions of  
  
  

Summer,  
Not a bit of breeze,  
Neon signs are shining,  
Through the tired trees,  
Lovers,  
Walking to and fro,  
Everyone has someone,  
And a place to go  
Now listen,  
Hear the cars go past,  
They don't even see me,  
Flying by so fast,  
Moving,  
Going who knows where,  
Only thing I know is,  
I'm not going there  
Where do you go,  
When you feel that your brain is on fire,  
Where do you go when you don't even know  
What it is you desire,  
Listen  
Laughter everywhere,  
Hear it  
Life is in the air,  
As the night comes  
And the town awaits,  
Sound o' children calling  
And the squeal of brakes,  
Music  
But a lonely sound  
When you can't help wond'ring  
Where do I belong

No good man  
Loving on a no good plan never treats me as he should  
And that ain't good he's always bringing me down  
He's no saint Heaven knows that's what he ain't  
Spends his money foolishly and not on me  
I'm the one who gets the run around  
  
I ought to hate him but still I love him so  
Cos I require love that's made of fire  
And in his arms I find always get that kind  
No good man  
Ever since the world began there's been other folks like me  
Born to be in love with a no good man  
  
I ought to hate him but still I love him so  
Cos you see I require love that's made of fire  
And in his arms I find always get that kind  
No good man  
Ever since the world began there's been other folks like me  
Born to be in love with a no good man

When life seems full of clouds and rain  
I am filled with an awkward pain  
Who soothes my aching, thumping brain?  
Nobody  
  
When winder comes with snow and sleet  
I'm so tired  
with cold feet  
Who says, "Here's two bits, Nina  
Go and eat?"  
Nobody  
  
I ain't don't nothing  
To nobody  
I ain't never got nothing  
From from nobody  
No time  
And until I get me something  
Yes, from somebody sometime,  
Well, I don't intend to do nothing  
For nobody  
No time  
  
Then winter comes all cold and clear  
My friends they see me coming near  
Who says, "Come on in, child, and have a beer?"  
No-body  
  
When all day long things go amiss  
I go on find some bliss  
Who hands to me a golden kiss?  
Nobody  
  
I ain't ever done nothing  
To no-body  
I ain't ever got nothing  
From no-body no time  
And until I get me something  
From somebody somebody  
I don't intend to do nothing  
For nobody  
Nobody no time, no time  
Nobody no time

It's all over now

Years, they will come and go.  
Sometimes the tears will flow.  
Some of my memories will fade,  
But I'll always remember that one September day.  
I used to reminisce  
'Cause I thought that love was bliss.  
How did they know it would go astray?  
It began, and it ended on one September day.  
We met by chance,  
As people often do,  
But it blossomed, yes, it blossomed  
Into something I never knew.  
Now... It is in the past.  
They said it would never last.  
I'll not forget the moment back,  
Nor hot May or December,  
Nor June or November,  
But one September day.

The other woman finds time to manicure her nails  
The other woman is perfect where her rival fails  
And she's never seen with pin curls in her hair  
  
The other woman enchantes her clothes with french perfume  
The other woman keeps fresh cut flowers in each room  
There are never toys that's scattered everywhere  
  
And when her baby comes to call  
He'll find her waiting like a lonesome queen  
'Cause when she's by his side  
It's such a change from old routine  
  
But the other woman will always cry herself to sleep  
The other woman will never have his love to keep  
And as the years go by the other woman  
Will spend her life alone

Papa, can you hear me?  
Papa, can you see me?  
Papa, can you find me in the night?  
Papa, are you near me?  
Papa, can you hear me?  
Papa, can you help me not be frightened?  
  
Looking at the skies I see a million eyes  
Which ones are yours?  
Where are you now  
That yesterday has waved goodbye  
And closed it's doors  
The night is so much darker  
The wind is so much colder  
The world is so much bigger  
Now that I am alone.  
  
Papa, please forgive me  
I know you understand me  
Papa, don't you know I had no choice?  
Oh, can you hear me prayin'?  
Anything I'm sayin'?  
  
Even though the night is filled with voices  
I remember everything you ever taught me  
Evey book I've ever read.  
  
Can all the words,  
All the music help me face what's ahead?  
The trees are so much taller  
I feel so much smaller  
The moon is twice as lonely  
And the stars are half as bright.  
  
Daddy, how I love you  
Daddy, how I need you  
Daddy, how I miss you  
Kissing me goodnight.

You people can watch while I'm scrubbing these floors  
And I'm scrubbin' the floors while you're gawking  
Maybe once ya tip me and it makes ya feel swell  
In this crummy Southern town  
In this crummy old hotel  
But you'll never guess to who you're talkin'.  
No. You couldn't ever guess to who you're talkin'.  
  
Then one night there's a scream in the night  
And you'll wonder who could that have been  
And you see me kinda grinnin' while I'm scrubbin'  
And you say, "What's she got to grin?"  
I'll tell you.  
  
There's a ship  
The Black Freighter  
With a skull on its masthead  
Will be coming in  
  
You gentlemen can say, "Hey gal, finish them floors!  
Get upstairs! What's wrong with you! Earn your keep here!  
You toss me your tips  
And look out to the ships  
But I'm counting your heads  
As I'm making the beds  
Cuz there's nobody gonna sleep here, honey  
Nobody  
Nobody!  
  
Then one night there's a scream in the night  
And you say, "Who's that kicking up a row?"  
And ya see me kinda starin' out the winda  
And you say, "What's she got to stare at now?"  
I'll tell ya.  
  
There's a ship  
The Black Freighter  
Turns around in the harbor  
Shootin' guns from her bow  
  
Now  
You gentlemen can wipe off that smile off your face  
Cause every building in town is a flat one  
This whole frickin' place will be down to the ground  
Only this cheap hotel standing up safe and sound  
And you yell, "Why do they spare that one?"  
Yes.  
That's what you say.  
"Why do they spare that one?"  
  
All the night through, through the noise and to-do  
You wonder who is that person that lives up there?  
And you see me stepping out in the morning  
Looking nice with a ribbon in my hair  
  
And the ship  
The Black Freighter  
Runs a flag up its masthead  
And a cheer rings the air  
  
By noontime the dock  
Is a-swarmin' with men  
Comin' out from the ghostly freighter  
They move in the shadows  
Where no one can see  
And they're chainin' up people  
And they're bringin' em to me  
Askin' me,  
"Kill them NOW, or LATER?"  
Askin' ME!  
"Kill them now, or later?"  
  
Noon by the clock  
And so still by the dock  
You can hear a foghorn miles away  
And in that quiet of death  
I'll say, "Right now.  
Right now!"  
  
Then they'll pile up the bodies  
And I'll say,  
"That'll learn ya!"  
  
And the ship  
The Black Freighter  
Disappears out to sea  
And  
On  
It  
Is  
Me

Plain gold ring on his finger he wore  
It was where everyone could see  
He belonged to someone, but not me  
On his hand was a plain gold band  
  
Plain gold ring has a story to tell  
It was one that I knew too well  
In my heart it will never be spring  
Long as he wears a plain gold ring  
Oh, oh  
  
When nighttime comes a callin' on me  
I know why I will never be free  
I can't stop these teardrops of mine  
I'm gonna love him till the end of time  
  
Plain gold ring has but one thing to say  
I'll remember till my dying day  
In my heart it will never be spring  
Long as he wears a plain gold ring  
Plain gold ring on his finger he wore  
Plain gold ring on his finger he wore  
Plain gold ring on his finger he wore

A child ran through the meadow on a sun drenched summer day  
And then he stopped his play  
And kneeled in a field of poppies.  
A man walked through my ghetto on a humid summer day  
And then he stopped to pay and he dealed in a field of poppies.  
Oh, flower of forgetfulness, just an hour away to the moon  
Take a deep breath if you are reaching for truth  
While you're in the stupor  
The door knocks and death takes another youth.  
Poppies, red poppies..., red poppies...  
A boy I used to know, a boy I used to know who's laughter rang to the skies  
Was a joy to behold  
Then I looked into his eyes, a look so cold, a boy who (rose on (? ? ? sorry))  
In a field of poppies  
Poppies, red poppies, red poppies, red poppies..., red poppies...,  
Red poppies...., red poppies..., red poppies..., red poppies...,  

I love you, Porgy  
Don't let him take me  
Don't let him handle me  
And drive me mad  
  
If you can keep me  
I want to stay with you forever  
And I'll be glad  
  
I love you, Porgy  
Don't let him take me  
Don't let him handle me  
With his hot hands  
  
If you can keep me  
I want to stay with you forever  
I like my man  
  
Someday I know he's coming  
Back to call me  
He's gonna handle me  
And hold me so  
  
It's going to be like dying, Porgy  
When he calls me  
But when he comes, I know  
I'll have to go

You know I smoked a lot of grass,oh lord

Here with tombstones in their eyes  
'cause the pusher don't care  
Child if you live or if you die  
God damn on the pusher, yea yea  
I said God damn him

With lots of love racks in his hand  
But the pusher is a monster  
Good god, oh lord he's my natural man  
You know the dealer  
The dealer takes a nickel lord  
And sells you lots of sweet dreams  
And lord knows we need lots a sweet dreams  
  
But here comes the pusher  
Takes your body and leaves your mind a screen  
God damn on the pusher  
I said God damn the pusher  
He's not a natural man  
You know the dealer takes a nickel  
And he sells a box of sweet dreams  
But he pusher takes your body  
He takes your body  
He takes your body  
And he leaves your mind a screen  
God damn him

If I were the president, hear me, of this land  
I'd declare totale war on the pusher man  
Gimme now, now

I'd cut him if he runs yea  
I'd kill him with my bible  
My razor and my gun  
God damn him, God damn him  
Oh, the pusher  
God damn the pusher man  

Rags old iron rags old iron  
All he was buying was just rags and old iron  
I heard that old rag man now making his rounds  
He came right to my alley Lord with sorrowful sounds  
Crying rags old iron and pulling his cart  
Ask him how much he'd give me for my broken heart  
  
Rags old iron rags old iron  
All he was buying was just rags and old iron  
So I asked that old rag man how much he would pay  
For a heart that was broken baby when you went away  
For a burnt out old love light that no longer beams  
And a couple of slightly used second hand dreams  
  
Rags old iron rags old iron  
All he was buying was just rags and old iron  
For those big empty promises you used to make  
For those memories of you that are no longer sweet  
I wish he could haul them off down the street  
  
Rags old iron rags old iron  
All he was buying was just rags and old iron  
When love doesn't last tell me what is it worth  
It was once mama's most precious possession on earth  
When I asked that old rag man if he'd like to buy  
He just shook his head and continued to cry  
  
Rags old iron rags old iron  
All he was buying was just rags and old iron  
Rags old iron rags old iron  
Rags old iron rags old iron rags old iron

And now we got a revolution  
Cause I see the face of things to come  
Yeah, your Constitution  
Well, my friend, its gonna have to bend  
I'm here to tell you about destruction  
Of all the evil that will have to end.  
Some folks are gonna get the notion  
I know they'll say I'm preachin' hate  
But if I have to swim the ocean  
Well I would just to communicate

The daily struggle just to stay alive  
Singin' about a revolution  
Because were talkin' about a change  
Its more than just evolution  
Well you know you got to clean your brain  
The only way that we can stand in fact  
Is when you get your foot off our back

Dressed in green  
Wears silk stockings  
With golden seams  
See-line woman  
  
See-line woman  
Dressed in red  
Make a man lose his head  
See-line woman  
  
See-line woman  
Black dress on  
For a thousand dollars  
She wail and she moan  
See-line woman  
  
Wiggle wiggle  
Turn like a cat  
Wink at a man  
And he wink back  
Now child  
See-line woman  
  
Empty his pockets  
And wreck his days  
Make him love her  
And she'll fly away  
  
See-line woman  
Take it on out now  
Empty his pockets  
And she wreck his days  
And she make him love her  
Then she sure fly away  
She got a black dress on  
For a thousand dollars  
She wail and she moan

Darling, you always needed  
And your tenderness is needed too  
And it seems that I'm never tired  
Loving you, loving you  
Never was a feeling stronger  
Aching for the sweet things you do  
And it seems that I'm never tired loving you  
Should the mountains crumble to ashes  
And the rain should cease to fall  
And if the river stopped it's flowing  
You'd still be my all in all  
And if the clouds cover the sky  
So the sunlight won't come through  
Then I will never, never, never, never, never,  
Never, tire loving you

Yeah  
This is a song... was sung by Leadbelly and it was written for...his friend...  
He had a friend named Blind Lemon...  
And they used to ride back and forth on a train from somewhere to Texas...  
And I leraned this tune from a record  
I heard by him  
  
Silver City bound I'm Silver City bound  
I'm gonna tell my little baby I'm Silver City bound  
I'm gonna meet Blind Lemon gonna ride on down  
Silver City bound I'm Silver City bound  
I'm gonna tell my little baby I'm Silver City bound  
I'm gonna meet Blind Lemon gonna ride on down  
  
Take me by the hand oh babe  
And lead me to the promises land  
Take me by the hand oh babe  
And lead me to the promised land  
  
Silver City bound I'm Silver City bound  
I'm gonna tell my little baby I'm Silver City bound  
I'm gonna meet Blind Lemon gonna ride on down  
  
Take me by the hand oh babe  
And lead me to the promises land  
Take me by the hand oh babe  
And lead me to the promised land  
  
I'm Silver City bound I'm Silver City bound  
I'm gonna tell my little baby I'm Silver City bound  
I'm gonna meet Blind Lemon gonna ride on down  
  
Silver City bound I'm Silver City bound  
I'm gonna tell my little baby I'm Silver City bound  
I'm gonna meet Blind Lemon gonna ride on down

You made me leave my happy home  
You took my love and now you're gone  
Since I fell for you  
  
Love brings such misery and pain  
I guess I'll never be the same  
Since I fell for you  
  
It's so bad, It's so sad  
I'm in love with you  
You love me, then you snub me  
But what can I do  
I'm still in love with you  
  
I guess I'll never see the light  
I get the blues 'bout every night  
Since I fell for you  
Since I fell for you

(1853) wasserman, aaron neville  
Oh I'm lonely and left with tears and sorrow  
I can't face tomorrow since my love has gone  
He's left me left me for another and my heart went with him  
How can I go on  
Was our love a game played for a day  
Were you pretending two hearts gone astray  
Am I to blame for this unhappy ending  
Nothing else is left me but a memory  
Beloved how I long to hold you in my arms enfold you  
Live again out happiness but now I can face tomorrow alone  
Since my love has gone

(1934) Eddie Delange, Irving Mills, Duke Ellington  
  
In my solitude you haunt me  
With reveries of days gone by  
In my solitude you taunt me  
With memories that never die  
  
I sit in my chair  
Filled with despair  
Nobody could be so sad  
With gloom ev'rywhere  
I sit and I stare  
I know that I'll soon go mad  
  
In my solitude  
I'm praying  
Dear Lord above  
Send back my love  
  
  
  
Original lyric  
  
In my solitude you haunt me  
With reveries of days gone by  
In my solitude you taunt me  
With memories that never die  
  
I sit in my chair  
I'm filled with despair  
There's no one could be so sad  
With gloom ev'rywhere  
I sit and I stare  
I know that I'll soon go mad  
  
In my solitude  
I'm praying  
Dear Lord above  
Send back my love

There's a saying old  
Says that love is blind  
Still we're often told  
"Seek and ye shall find"  
So I'm going to seek  
A certain lad  
I've had in mind  
  
Looking everywhere  
Haven't found him yet  
He's the big affair  
I cannot forget  
Only man I ever think  
Of with regret  
  
I'd like  
To add his inital  
To my monogram  
Tell me  
Where is the shepherd  
For this lost lamb?  
  
There's a somebody  
I'm longin' to see  
I hope that he turns  
Out to be  
Someone to watch over me  
  
I'm a little lamb  
Who's lost in the wood  
I know I could  
Always be good  
To one  
Who'll watch over me  
  
Although he may  
Not be the man some  
Girls think  
Of as handsome  
To my heart  
He carries the key  
  
Won't you tell him please  
To put on some speed  
Follow my lead  
Oh, how I need  
Someone to watch over me  
  
Won't you tell him please  
To put on some speed  
Follow my lead  
Oh, how I need  
Someone to watch over me  
Someone to watch over me

Richard Rodgers, Lorenz Hart  
  
Sprinh is here  
Why doesn't my heart go dancing  
Spring is here  
Why isn't the waltz entrancing  
No desire no ambition leads me  
Maybe it's becaus nobody needs me  
  
Spring is here  
Why doesn't the breeze delight me  
Stars appear  
Why doesn't the night invite me  
But maybe it's because nobody loves me  
Spring is here I hear  
Somebody told me spring is here

I was never one for singing what I really feel  
Except tonight I'm bringing everything I know that's real  
  
Stars, they come and go, they come fast or slow  
They go like the last light of the sun, all in a blaze  
And all you see is glory  
Hey but it gets lonely there when there's no one here to share  
We can shake it away, if you'll hear a story  
  
People lust for fame like athletes in a game,  
we break our collarbones and come up swinging,  
some of us are downed  
some of us are crowned, and some are lost and never found  
But most have seen it all,  
they live their lives in sad cafes and music halls  
They always come up singing  
  
Some make it when they're young,  
before the world has done its dirty job  
and later on someone will say  
"You've had your day, now you must make way"  
But they'll never know the pain of living with a name you never owned  
or the many years forgetting what you know too well  
That the ones who gave the crown have been let down  
You try to make amends without defending  
Perhaps pretending you never saw the eyes of grown men of twenty-five  
that follow as you walk and ask for autographs  
Or kiss you on the cheek and you never can believe they really loved you  
Some make it when they're old  
(Perhaps they have a soul they're not afraid to bare  
or perhaps there's nothing there)  
  
Stars, they come and go, they come fast they come slow  
They go like the last light of the sun, all in a blaze  
And all you see is glory  
But most have seen it all,  
they live their lives in sad cafes and music halls  
They always have a story  
  
Some women have a body men will want to see  
and so they put it on display  
Some people play a fine guitar, I could listen to them play all day  
Some ladies really move across the stage and gee, they sure can dance  
I guess I could learn how, if I gave it half a chance  
  
But I always feel so funny when my body tries to soar  
And I seem to always worry about missing the next chord  
I guess there isn't anything to put up on display  
Except the tunes, and whatever else I say  
But anyway, that isn't really what I meant to say  
I meant to tell a story, I live from day to day  
  
Stars, they come and go, they're coming fast they come slow  
They go like the last light of the sun, all in a blaze  
And all you see is glory  
But most have seen it all,  
who live their lives in sad cafes and music halls  
And we always have a story  
  
So if you don't lose patience with my fumbling around  
I'll come up singing for you, even when I'm down

All that I have is all that you've given me  
(Ohhhh)  
Did you never worry that I'd come to depend on you  
(Ohhhh)  
I gave you all the love I had in me  
Now I find you lied and I can't believe its true  
Oooh whoa oh  
You better stop (Stop)  
Before you tear me apart  
You better stop (Stop)  
Before you go and break my heart  
Ooooh oooh oooh you better stop  
Time after time I tried to walk away  
But its not that easy  
When you soul is torn in two  
So I just resigned myself to it everyday yeh  
And now all that I can do is to leave it up to you Ohhh  
Ooh whoa oh  
You better stop (Stop)  
Before you tear me apart  
You better stop (Stop)  
Before you go and break my heart  
Ooooh oooh oooh you better stop  
Ohh ooh whoa you better stop  
If you love me  
Now the time to be sorry  
I won't believe that you'd walk out on me baby  
Ohhh yehhh  
Oooh  
Ooh whoa oh  
You better stop (Stop)  
Before you tear me apart  
You better stop (Stop)  
Before you go and break my heart  
No whoa whoa you'd better stop stop  
Oooh whoa oh  
You'd better stop stop stop  
You'd better stop stop  
  

Southern trees bearin' strange fruit,  
Blood on the leaves and blood at the root,  
Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze,  
Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees.  
  
Pastoral scene of the gallant south,  
Them big bulging eyes and the twisted mouth,  
Scent of magnolias, clean and fresh,  
Then the sudden smell of burning flesh.  
  
Here is fruit for the crows to pluck,  
For the rain to gather, for the wind to suck,  
For the sun to rot, for the leaves to drop,  
Here is a strange and bitter crop.

I want a little sugar  
In my bowl  
I want a little sweetness  
Down in my soul  
I could stand some lovin'  
Oh so bad  
I feel so funny and I feel so sad  
  
I want a little steam  
On my clothes  
Maybe I can fix things up  
So they'll go  
Whatsa matter Daddy  
Come on, save my soul  
I need some sugar in my bowl  
I ain't foolin'  
I want some sugar in my bowl  
  
You been acting different  
I've been told  
Soothe me  
I want some sugar in my bowl  
I want some steam  
On my clothes  
Maybe I can fix things up so they'll go  
Whatsa matter Daddy  
Come on save my soul  
I want some sugar in my bowl  
I ain't foolin'  
I want some, yeah, in my bowl

One more  
Sunday in Savannah  
Hear the whole creation shoutin'  
Praise the Lord  
  
See them flinging out the banner  
While the congregation says amen  
Young folk  
Tendin' Sunday School  
  
They sing merrilly 'bout the golden rule  
Horse sense preaching all the day  
They all hollar in the righteous way  
It's time for me to call on Mother Hannah  
  
While she sits there wishing for her last reward  
One more Sunday in Savannah  
One more Sunday in Atlanta  
It's the same thing  
  
Same feeling  
Don't ya dare  
Go fishin' son  
Amen

Precious Lord, take my hand,  
Lead me on, let me stand,  
I am tired, I am weak, I am worn.  
Through the storm, through the night,  
Lead me on to the light  
Take my hand precious Lord, Lead me home.  
  
When my way grows drear precious Lord linger near  
When my light is almost gone  
Hear my cry, hear my call  
Hold my hand lest I fall  
Take my hand precious Lord, lead me home  
  
When the darkness appears and the night draws near  
And the day is past and gone  
At the river I stand  
Guide my feet, hold my hand  
Take my hand precious Lord, lead me home  
  
Precious Lord, take my hand  
Lead me on, let me stand  
I'm tired, I'm weak, I'm alone  
Through the storm, through the night  
Lead me on to the light  
Take my hand precious Lord, lead me home

Now if you want something to play with, go out and find yourself a toy,  
Cause little boy my time is too expensive and I'm not a little boy  
So if you are serious, don't play with my heart, it makes me furious  
But if you want me to love you, you know I will, you know I will  
  
Tell it like it is  
  
Don't be ashamed, let your conscience be your guide  
I know deep down inside of me I believe you love me  
So forget your foolish pride, life is too short for sorrow  
You may be here today and gone tomorrow  
You might as well get what you want  
So go on and please  
  
Tell it like it is  
I'm nothing to play with, go and find yourself a toy  
Tell it like it is  
Tell it like it is

Tell me more and then some  
Daddy you know what I wanna hear  
I want some more and then some of that  
I love you only dear  
  
I want some more and then some  
Oh how you feel  
And then when you done told me  
About a million times  
How much you love me  
And you're through  
Start right back again  
  
I've made the same mistake  
I know the awful ache  
Of a little heart that's been double crossed  
The waiting's been so long so long  
It's hard to be believing  
I thought I'd missed my guess  
I thought happiness for me was lost  
  
I want more some more  
Some more and then some  
You know how I love that stuff  
Whisper from now on till Doomsday  
But I never  
No I never no I never  
Will get enough  

I can only give you country walks in spring time  
The hand to hold when leaves begin to fall  
And the lover's burning lights were born on the winter nights  
That's all that's all  
  
There are those I know who have told you  
They could give you the whole round world for a toy  
All I have are my arms to enfold you  
And a love time can never destroy destroy  
  
So if you're wondering what I'm asking in return dear  
You'll be so surprised to know my demands are very small  
Just say it's me that you adore for now nad evermore  
That's all that's all

Don't try to blow out the sun for me baby  
I'm not asking for what I know can't be  
All that I ask is a kiss a day  
And I'll give you love that'll never go away  
Yes I will yes I will  
I wouldn't ask you to lift up  
This great big world little baby  
I'm not that kind of a girl  
  
All that I ask is a smile or two  
And nothing in this world will be too good for you  
Nobody nobody nobody nobody nobody  
Nobody knows how deep my love for you really goes  
But boy I want you to know  
I wouldn't ask you to hold back the light of dawn baby  
That's too much to ask to anyone  
  
All that I ask is your loving ways  
And I'll keep you happy  
For the rest of your natural born days baby  
You hear me talking to you  
I'll keep you happy  
I'll keep you happy for the rest of your days daddy  
Just believe me
