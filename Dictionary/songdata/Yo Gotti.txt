[Chorus]  
All I ever wanted to do was live the life  
Money, drugs, cars, clothes hoes  
Brick, paints, pounds of dro fa sho  
A young nigga living how he supposed ya know  
  
I got sixteen 28 grams broke down to dimes  
What's my life like nigga its a constant grind  
You got seven eight or nine you can push on  
Cause I'm a selfish nigga I want 10 strong  
Oh no it happened again  
Let me get a good flow of that dro again  
Got phone blowin' up like a high school bell  
Plus the price sky rocket like dope in jail  
Break it down in small portions fuck sellin' a O  
You'd rather make seven or eight or cock bound for da 4  
I'm a hustla far from being a busta nigga  
You got good game but still don't trust ya nigga  
You can catch me in the neighborhood winter or summer  
Spring or fall cause nigga I be selling it all  
From junts to blunts blunts to bags and bags to O's  
O's to pounds I'm just holding it down  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
I got 36 ounces blocked up pure yola  
Make it times 2 once I hit it with the soda  
Whip it up good in a beacon and a blender  
Have it rock hard plus white as December  
I switch up my raps yo I never go the same way  
Plus I get a different prepaid every 30 days  
So if I get jam I know where it came from  
Rub my shit suitable never serve unusual  
All money ain't good and all money ain't fine  
Some money come with blood and some money come with time  
Some money can't spend and some money ain't safe  
Money in the wrong way I'll lead you to the wrong place  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
I got 8 or 9 paints and a bottle of kay row  
And I wouldn't give a fuck if you nod or stay woke  
I just got back from the N Y C 250 a paint  
Back in Memphis Tenn with drank  
50 a ounce after I done added the bounce  
45 get the nine and every dollar gone count  
I'm a hustla' don't make me say it again  
I ain't trying to please a nigga I'm trying to stack some ends  
The strong survive while the weak slowly dying  
I'm congruent to them boys I'm out there slanging them pies  
They never stop trying they never give up they gotta succeed  
My life is like the saying nigga crack speed or weed  
  
[Chorus]

[Chorus x2]  
You throw Rose by the case [?]  
Three hundred dollar jewellery [?] we [?] by the cases.  
You define my case, Gucci is got no laces

Fuck you

Tell a hater I just said  
Fuck you  
Fuck you  
Fuck you  
Fuck you  
And tell your bitch I just said  
  
Meek  
Ass up, face down  
One night only, I'm from out of town  
Pound, new rules we ain't waiting on it  
And if that pussy good we spend a cake on it  
Patty cake, hotel, new bed, new Chanel  
Giuseppe sneakers, his or hers  
If you a hater I just got two words  
  
Fuck you  
Fuck you  
Fuck you  
Fuck you  
Tell a hater I just said  
Fuck you  
Fuck you  
Fuck you

And tell your bitch I just said  
  
You, and the bitches that you came with  
All in my section drinking my shit  
You ain't fucking, you ain't sucking what you doing ho?  
Instagram and taking pictures, but you don't know me though  
Damn, she said that she a fan  
Yea I understand, but I want to get in her pants  
'Cause she looking for, she licking her tongue out  
She said she don't fuck with rappers  
I'm like what you talking about bitch?  
  
Fuck you  
Fuck you  
Fuck you  
Fuck you  
I got two words for you  
Fuck you  
Fuck you  
Fuck you  
Fuck you  
Tell my hater I said  
  
Oh, I said fuck 'em  
I don't like 'em, I don't love 'em  
When the money come home  
It's turning haters, I don't trust 'em  
If the brick ain't coming with a stick, I don't touch 'em  
Want that BMF with the Scorpio when I'm bustin'  
Like a bitch when she twerkin', y'all niggas workin'  
Clowin' ass niggas, we should put you in the circus  
In the cage with the lion, let him have you for dessert  
And testifying on your homie, took a dip, but was it worth it nigga?  
I'm in this bitch, she said my friend she want to fuck you  
I like your friend, but I really you know, I wanna fuck you  
And if I hit my rody he got to fuck too  
And put your middle fingers up and scream  
  
Haters, niggas mad at the paper  
Big crib, 10 car, 20 acres  
20 chains, 10 watches on my jewels  
Little watch with the chips, don't let 'em fool  
Nigga I can school you on how to look like money  
Hustla of the year, can write a book about money  
Don't pop them bottles, tryna impress them ho's  
With your re-up money, better tell dem ho's bitch  
  
Fuck you  
Fuck you  
Fuck you  
Fuck you  
Tell a bitch I said  
Fuck you  
Fuck you  
Fuck you  
Fuck you  
Tell my hater I said
