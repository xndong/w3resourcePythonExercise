[Verse 1]  
I found my life in between shots and getting high  
The cage I was in fell away when she asked me to dance again, yeah  
I found my life in between a first kiss and a last goodbye  
The dust settled down, now I can see through the crowd  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I'm loving the colour white  
Surrounding your colored eyes  
Though she is the kryptonite  
She stays in my crib tonight  
I light her like dynamite  
Load her like gigabyte  
Turn out the fucking lights  
I wanna see you bright  
  
[Chorus]  
I wanna see you bright  
I wanna see you bright  
I wanna see you bright  
I wanna see you  
  
[Verse 2]  
For the love in my mind, love for the bass  
She likes getting high just for the day  
She's different in night, she knows what I say  
Free of the flash, dirt on your shoes, I don't know you  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I'm loving the colour white  
Surrounding your coloured eyes  
Though she is the kryptonite  
She stays in my crib tonight  
I light her like dynamite  
Load her like gigabyte  
Turn out the fucking lights  
I wanna see you bright  
  
[Chorus]  
I wanna see you bright  
I wanna see you bright  
I wanna see you bright  
I wanna see you bright  
  
[Bridge]  
I found my life in between shots and getting high  
The cage I was in fell away when she asked me to dance again  
  
[Chorus]  
I wanna see you bright  
I wanna see you bright  
I wanna see you bright  
I wanna see you bright  
I wanna see you bright  
I wanna see you bright  
I wanna see you bright  
I wanna see you

[Intro]  
We're so late nights  
Red eyes, amnesia, on ice  
Late nights, red eyes  
Amnesia, I need ya  
  
[Verse 1]  
Right now I can't see straight  
Intoxicated it's true when I'm with you  
I'm buzzing and I feel laced  
I'm coming from a different phase when I'm with you  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Another way now, like we're supposed to do  
Take you to the back now, I'd take a shot for you  
Wasted every night, gone for every song  
Faded every night, dancing all night long  
  
[Chorus]  
Drunk all Summer, drunk all Summer  
We've been drunk all Summer  
Drinking and flowing and rolling  
We're falling down  
  
[Refrain]  
We're so late nights  
Red eyes, amnesia, I need ya  
  
[Verse 2]  
Right now I'm emotional  
I lose control, when I'm with you  
I hope I haven't said too much  
Guess I always push my luck when I'm with you  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Another way now, like we're supposed to do  
Take you to the back now, I'd take a shot for you  
Wasted every night, gone for every song  
Faded every night, dancing all night long  
  
[Chorus]  
Drunk all Summer, drunk all Summer  
We've been drunk all Summer  
Drinking and flowing and rolling  
We're falling down  
  
[Refrain]  
We're so late nights  
Red eyes, amnesia, on ice  
Late nights, red eyes  
Amnesia, I need ya  
  
[Outro]  
Drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk  
Drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk  
(You put your drinks up)  
Drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk  
Drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk  
Drunk all Summer  
Drunk all Summer

[Verse 1]  
This love is tainted, I need you and I hate it  
You're caught between a dream and a movie scene  
In a way, you know what I mean  
When the darts just miss, I just can't resist it  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause I'm a fool for you and the things you do  
I'm a fool for you and the things, the things you do  
The things you do  
The things you do  
  
[Verse 2]  
When you're looking like this, I just can't resist it  
I know sometimes I hide it  
But I can't this time cause it's gonna defeat me  
But you won't believe me, believe me  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause I'm a fool for you and the things you do  
I'm a fool for you and the things, the things you do  
  
[Bridge]  
I know, I know given the chance I'd do it again  
Cause I can't help myself  
Cause I can't stop myself  
I just love being a fool for you  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause I'm a fool for you and the things you do  
I'm a fool for you and the things, the things you do  
  
[Outro]  
This love is tainted

[Verse 1]  
She got, she got, she got  
Her own reasons  
For talking to me  
And she don't, she don't, she don't  
Give a fuck  
About what I need  
And I can't tell you why  
Because my brain can't equate it  
  
[Refrain]  
Tell me your lies  
Because I just can't face it  
  
[Chorus]  
It's you, it's you  
It's you  
It's you, it's you  
It's you  
  
[Verse 2]  
I won't, I won't, I won't  
Cover the scars  
I'll let 'em bleed  
So my silence  
So my silence won't  
Be mistaken for peace  
Am I wrong for wanting us to make it?  
  
[Refrain]  
Tell me your lies  
Because I just can't face it  
  
[Chorus]  
It's you, it's you  
It's you  
It's you, it's you  
It's you  
  
[Bridge]  
Could it be that it's a lesson  
That I never had to learn?  
I looked at it like a blessing  
And now it's just a curse  
I don't know why  
I don't know why  
  
[Chorus]  
It's you, it's you  
It's you, it's you  
It's you

[Verse 1]  
Hey what's up, it's been a while  
Talking 'bout it's not my style  
Thought I'd see what's up, while I'm lighting up  
It's cold-hearted, cold-hearted  
Know it's late but I'm so wired  
Saw your face and got inspired  
Guess you let it go, now you're good to go  
It's cold-hearted, cold-hearted  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Oh, oh  
It's probably gonna sound wrong  
Promise it won't last long  
Oh, oh  
If we can never go back  
Thought you'd like to know that  
  
[Chorus]  
He, won't touch you like I do  
He, won't love you like I would  
He don't know your body  
He don't do you right  
He won't love you like I would  
Love you like I would  
  
[Verse 2]  
Talkin' don't want me, cause I want you  
Been thinkin' it over, but I'm through  
So stop wasting all my time, messing with my mind  
It's cold-hearted, cold-hearted  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Oh, oh  
It's probably gonna sound wrong  
Promise it won't last long  
Oh, oh  
If we can never go back  
Thought you'd like to know that  
  
[Chorus]  
He, won't touch you like I do  
He, won't love you like I would  
He don't know your body  
He don't do you right  
He won't love you like I would  
Love you like I would  
Like I would  
He, won't touch you like I do  
He, won't love you like I would  
He don't know your body  
He don't do you right  
He won't love you like I would  
Love you like I would  
Like I would  
  
[Bridge]  
He can't love you like I would  
He can't love you like I could  
He don't know your body  
He don't know your body  
  
[Chorus]  
He, won't touch you like I do  
He, won't love you like I would  
He don't know your body  
He don't do you right  
He won't love you like I would  
Love you like I would  
Like I would  
He, won't touch you like I do  
He, won't love you like I would  
He don't know your body  
He don't do you right  
He won't love you like I would  
Love you like I would  
Like I would

[Verse 1]  
Climb on board  
We'll go slow and high tempo  
Light and dark  
Hold me hard and mellow  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I'm seeing the pain, seeing the pleasure  
Nobody but you, 'body but me, 'body but us  
Bodies together  
I'd love to hold you close, tonight and always  
I'd love to wake up next to you  
I'd love to hold you close, tonight and always  
I'd love to wake up next to you  
  
[Chorus]  
So we'll piss off the neighbours  
In the place that feels the tears  
The place to lose your fears  
Yeah, reckless behavior  
A place that is so pure, so dirty and raw  
Be in the bed all day, bed all day, bed all day  
Fucking you, and fighting on  
It's our paradise and it's our war zone  
It's our paradise and it's our war zone  
  
[Verse 2]  
Pillow talk  
My enemy, my ally  
Prisoners  
Then we're free, it's a thriller  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I'm seeing the pain, seeing the pleasure  
Nobody but you, 'body but me, 'body but us  
Bodies together  
I'd love to hold you close, tonight and always  
I'd love to wake up next to you  
I'd love to hold you close, tonight and always  
I'd love to wake up next to you  
  
[Chorus]  
So we'll piss off the neighbours  
In the place that feels the tears  
The place to lose your fears  
Yeah, reckless behavior  
A place that is so pure, so dirty and raw  
Be in the bed all day, bed all day, bed all day  
Fucking you, and fighting on  
It's our paradise and it's our war zone  
It's our paradise and it's our war zone  
  
[Bridge]  
Paradise, paradise, paradise, paradise  
War zone, war zone, war zone, war zone  
Paradise, paradise, paradise, paradise  
War zone, war zone, war zone, war zone  
  
[Chorus]  
So we'll piss off the neighbours  
In the place that feels the tears  
The place to lose your fears  
Yeah, reckless behavior  
A place that is so pure, so dirty and raw  
Be in the bed all day, bed all day, bed all day  
Fucking you, and fighting on  
It's our paradise and it's our war zone  
It's our paradise and it's our war zone

[Verse 1]  
Can your heart be mine in search?  
Cause I have no time to help you find all the words  
Melodies and memories, stories that sound absurd  
I will tell no lies  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
As long as you look me in the eyes  
I'll go wherever you are, I'll follow behind  
  
[Chorus]  
Heard about all the things you've done  
And all the wars that you've been in  
Heard about all the love you lost  
It was over before it began  
Heard about all the miles you've gone  
Just to start again  
Heard about all that you've been through  
And it sounds like you need a friend, a friend  
  
[Verse 2]  
Please don't wait, I'm not coming home tonight  
I wanna love you but I can't  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
As long as you look me in the eyes  
I'll go wherever you are, I'll follow behind  
  
[Chorus]  
Heard about all the things you've done  
And all the wars that you've been in  
Heard about all the love you lost  
It was over before it began  
Heard about all the miles you've gone  
Just to start again  
Heard about all that you've been through  
And it sounds like you need a friend, a friend  
  
[Bridge]  
I never doubted myself  
But I doubted you  
I'm tired of looking at myself  
In my rear view  
  
[Chorus]  
Heard about all the things you've done  
And all the wars that you've been in  
Heard about all the love you lost  
It was over before it began  
Heard about all the miles you've gone  
Just to start again  
Heard about all the that you've been through  
And it sounds like you need a friend, a friend

[Verse 1]  
She puts her spirit in a nightcap  
She always knows where the crowd's at  
She puts her mouth round the cigarette  
I put it out cause she likes that  
She always dance when it's raining  
Hey when's it startin', baby  
She looks at me like she's waiting  
Making time go slow when they show her the table  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Bright lights, but she's fading  
Feels right, she's crazy  
Bright lights, but she's fading  
Feels right, she's crazy  
  
[Chorus]  
She wants somebody to love, to hold her  
She wants somebody to love in the right way  
She wants somebody to love, to kiss her  
She wants somebody to love in the right way  
  
[Verse 2]  
She's crying out that she loves me  
Holding my hands so I won't leave  
Cause baby don't wanna be lonely  
She says "I just want you to hold me"  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Bright lights, but she's fading  
Feels right, she's crazy  
Bright lights, but she's fading  
Feels right, she's crazy  
  
[Chorus]  
She wants somebody to love, to hold her  
She wants somebody to love in the right way  
She wants somebody to love, to kiss her  
She wants somebody to love in the right way  
In the right way, in the right way  
  
[Bridge]  
In the right way, in the, in the right way  
In the right way, in the right way  
In the right way, in the, in the right way  
In the right way, in the right way  
In the right way, in the, in the right way  
In the right way, in the right way  
In the right way, in the, in the right way  
In the right way  
  
[Chorus]  
She wants somebody to love, to hold her  
She wants somebody to love in the right way  
She wants somebody to love, to hold her  
She wants somebody to love in the right way  
She wants somebody to love, to kiss her  
She wants somebody to love in the right way
