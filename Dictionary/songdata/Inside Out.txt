When you need a friend  
Don't look to a stranger  
You know in the end  
I'll always be there  
  
And when you're in doubt  
And when you're in danger  
Take a look all around  
I'll be there  
  
I'm sorry I'm just thinking of the right words to say  
I know they don't sound the way I planed them to be  
But if you wait around awhile I'll make you fall for me  
I promise you, I proise you I will  
  
I'm sorry I'm just thinking of the right words to say  
I know they don't sound the way I planed them to be  
But if I have to walk to world I'll make you fall for me  
I promise you, I promise you I will.  
  
When your day is through  
And so is your temper  
You know what to do  
I'll always be there  
  
Sometimes if I shout  
It's not what's intended  
These words just come out  
With no cross to bear  
  
I'm sorry I'm just thinking of the right words to say  
I know they don't sound the way I planed them to be  
But if you wait around awhile I'll make you fall for me  
I promise you, I proise you I will  
  
I'm sorry I'm just thinking of the right words to say  
I know they don't sound the way I planed them to be  
But if I have to walk to world I'll make you fall for me  
I promise you, I promise you I will.  
  
I gotta tell ya  
  
I gotta tell ya  
  
I gotta tell ya  
  
I'm sorry I'm just thinking of the right words to say  
I know they don't sound the way I planed them to be  
But if you wait around awhile I'll make you fall for me  
I promise you, I promise you I will  
  
I'm sorry I'm just thinking of the right words to say  
I know they don't sound the way I planed them to be  
But if I have to walk to world I'll make you fall for me  
I promise you, I promise you I will.

I want you to stay with me.  
To spend every day with me.

I want you to let me in.  
Although you're above me.  
I want you to love me.  
I want you to need me.  
Take my hand and lead me to you.  
Inside your heart,

To the one who controls my emotions.  
You are my divine religion.  
I offer complete devotion to you.  
So will you accept me?  
And let happen what could be.  
Just put some faith in destiny.  
And take a chance on me.  
Inside my heart,  
Inside my soul,  
'Cause inside your mind,  
I want you to find.

I am in love with a McDonald's girl.  
She has a smile of innocence.  
So tender and warm.  
I am in love with a McDonald's girl.  
She is an angel in a polyester uniform.  
I leave from softball practice every night.  
It's getting dark but the golden arches light up the way.  
I turn the corner at the traffic light.  
I count my money and I rehearse what I'm gonna say:  
I'd like an order of fries,  
And Quarter-Pounder with Cheese,  
I love the light in your eyes,  
Will you go out with me please?  
I am in love with a McDonald's girl.  
She has a smile of innocence.  
So tender and warm.  
I am in love with a McDonald's girl.  
She is an angel in a polyester uniform.  
She doesn't try to impress anyone.  
She doesn't try to be tough  
Like all the girls that I know.  
She doesn't treat me like a simpleton.  
I wanna say how I feel,  
If I could just let go.  
And when my hamburgers cold,  
I get up ready to go,  
She's only 16 years old,  
And I'm in love with her so.  
I am in love with a McDonald's girl.  
She has a smile of innocence.  
So tender and warm.  
I am in love with a McDonald's girl.  
She is an angel in a polyester uniform.  
There she stands behind the register.  
Taking orders from the  
Provo City Little League.  
If they knew how much I wanted her,  
Their home room teacher would have  
To send them home for a week.  
And when I head for the door, the  
Moonlight catches her eyes.  
My heart begins to soar, she smiles  
And waves goodbye. Goodbye  
I am in love with a McDonald's girl.  
She has a smile of innocence.  
So tender and warm.  
I am in love with a McDonald's girl.  
She is an angel in a polyester uniform.  
She is an angel in a polyester uniform. What a babe.  
She is an angel in a polyester uniform.  
I am in love with a McDonald's Girl.

A sea of smile and a river of tears  
A flood of memories  
Imagination will take me back  
I'll be with you  
On an Old Park Bench  
Old Park Bench  
Old Park Bench  
Old Park Bench  
A summer's night, the stars aglow  
Did more than light the sky  
With fortune, fantasy, and fate  
We dream on an old park bench  
I take your hand in my hand  
You hold my soul in yours  
One touch becomes eternal  
When falling in love  
On an Old Park Bench  
Old Park Bench  
Old Park Bench  
Old Park Bench  
I see her still and she is beautiful  
I see her beautiful face  
And her beautiful eyes  
And her beautiful ways  
And her beautiful soul  
And this love lifts me higher  
I search her eyes and see the skies  
The heavens of her life  
Just one more glimpse into her soul  
Is all I ask  
On an Old Park Bench  
Old Park Bench  
Old Park Bench  
Old Park Bench  
A sea of smiles and a river of tears  
A flood of memories  
And now she's gone  
On an Old Park Bench  
Old Park Bench  
Old Park Bench  
Old Park Bench  

Looking from a window above  
It's like a story of love  
Can you hear me?  
Came back only yesterday  
Moving farther away  
Want you near me!  
  
All I needed was the love you gave  
All I needed for another day  
And all I ever knew...only you  
  
Sometimes when I think of your name  
And it's only a game  
And I need you  
Listen to the words that you say  
It's getting harder to stay  
When I see you  
  
All I needed was the love you gave  
All I needed for another day  
And all I ever knew...only you  
  
This is gonna take a long time  
And I wonder what's mine  
I can't take no more  
Wonder if you'll understand  
It's just the touch of your hand  
Behind a closed door  
  
All I needed was the love you gave  
All I needed for another day  
And all I ever knew...only you  
  
This is gonna take a long time  
And I wonder what's mine  
I can't take no more  
Wonder if you'll understand  
It's just the touch of your hand  
Behind a closed door  
  
All I needed was the love you gave  
All I needed for another day  
And all I ever knew...only you

I'll always be there.  
And when you're in doubt,

I Promise You, I Promise You I Will.  
When your day is though,  
And so is your temper,  
You know what to do.

Lost at a game, so easy to play  
I lost my faith, I lost my stride  
How can this be, I fought so desperately  
Was too afraid to show what I had inside  
  
But I believe in redemption  
And I believe in redemption  
And I believe in redemption  
  
Children of the street wander so helplessly  
Who will pay for their suffering?  
We've got the power to set them free,  
Yet still, we do nothing, nothing  
  
But I believe in redemption.  
And I believe in redemption.  
And I believe in redemption.  
I believe!  
  
Sometimes I just don't know, I guess we lost our way to go  
Sometimes I just don't know, I guess we lost our way to go  
Sometimes I just don't know, I guess we lost our way to go  
Sometimes I just don't know, I guess we lost our way to go (x2)  
  
Redemption!

I want somebody to share, share the rest of my life,  
Share my innermost thoughts, know my intimate details.  
Someone who'll stand by my side, and give me support.  
And in return, she'll get my support.  
She will listen to me, when I want to speak,  
About the world we live in, and life in general.  
Though my views may be wrong, they may even be perverted,  
She'll hear me out and won't easily be converted  
To my way of thinking, in fact she'll often disagree,  
But at the end of it all, she will understand me.  
want somebody who cares for me  
Passionately,  
With every thought and with every breath.  
Somebody who will help me see things in a different light  
All of the things I detest I will almost like.  
I don't won't to be tied to anyone's strings.  
I'm carefully try to steer clear of those things.  
But when I'm asleep I want somebody  
Who will put their arms around and kiss me tenderly.  
Though things like this make me sick.  
In a case like this, I'll get away with it.  
And in a case like this, I'll get away with it.  
Tenderly.  

Imagine me and you, I do  
I think about you day and night  
It's only right to think about the girl I stalk  
Each day and night,  
So happy together.  
  
I dated you, for just a week  
You dumped me and I cried real hard  
And still can't sleep.  
So now I'll have to force you to come back to me,  
So happy together.  
  
I can't see me stalking nobody but you for all your life  
When you're with me baby the skies will be blue  
For all my life.  
  
I call you up at 2 am  
I wake you and hang up the phone  
And do it again.  
That's what you get for goin' out with other men,  
So happy together.  
  
I can't see me stalking nobody but you for all your life  
When you're with me baby the skies will be blue  
For all my life.  
  
I see you, you don't see me  
I'm hidden with my telephoto lense up in the tree  
You're walking and you look around, suspiciously,  
So happy together.  
  
"Hey...sugar...I like your eyebrows....no no that's kinda lame.  
I got it, I got it. Hey baby, it's me again....surprise! That's a good  
one, I like that, surprise, haha."  
  
I've got your cat, don't be alarmed,  
As long as you come talk to me,  
He won't be harmed  
We'll go and get a bite to eat  
I'll come unarmed  
So happy together...forever and ever...so happy together.  
  
"Get out of the tree with the cat in the air."
