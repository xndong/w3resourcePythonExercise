How lucky can one guy be?  
I kissed her and she kissed me  
Like the fella once said,  
"Ain't that a kick in the head?"  
The room was completely black,  
I hugged her and she hugged back  
Like the sailor said, quote,  
"Ain't that a hole in the boat?"  
  
My head keeps spinnin',  
I go to sleep and keep grinnin'  
If this is just the beginnin',  
my life is gonna be bee-yoo-tee-ful  
  
I've sunshine enough to spread,  
it's just like the fella said  
Tell me quick, ain't love a kick in the head?  
  
Like the fella once said,  
"Ain't that a kick in the head?"  
Like the sailor said, quote,  
"Ain't that a hole in the boat?"  
  
My head keeps spinnin',  
I go to sleep and keep grinnin'  
If this is just the beginnin',  
my life is gonna be bee-yoo-tee-ful  
  
She's tellin' me we'll be wed,  
she's picked out a king-size bed  
I couldn't feel any better or I'd be sick  
Tell me quick oh, ain't love a kick?  
Tell me quick ain't love a kick in the head?

I know when he's been on your mind  
That distant look is in your eyes  
I thought with time you'd realize it's over, over  
It's not the way I choose to live  
Bit something some where's gotta give  
As sharing in this relationship gets older, older  
  
You know I'd fight for you but how could I fight someone who isn't even there  
I've had the rest of you now I want the best of you I don't care if that's not  
Fair  
  
Cause I want it all  
Or nothing at all  
There's nowhere left to fall  
When you reach the bottom it's now or never  
Is it all  
Or are we just friends  
Is this how it ends  
With a simple telephone call  
You leave me here with nothing at all  
  
There are time it seems to me  
I'm sharing you with memories  
I feel it in my heart but I don't show it, show it  
Then there's times you look at me  
As though I'm all that you can see  
Those times I don't believe it's right I know it, know it  
  
Don't make me promises baby you never did know how to keep them well  
I had the rest of you now I want the best of you it's time to show and tell  
  
Cuz I want it all  
Or nothing at all  
There's nowhere left to fall  
When you reach the bottom it's now or never  
Is it all  
Or are we just friends  
Is this how it ends  
With a simple telephone call  
You leave me here with nothing at all  
  
Cause you and I  
Could lose it all if you've got no more room  
No more inside for me in your life  
  
Cause I want it all  
Or nothing at all  
There's nowhere left to fall  
It's now or never  
  
Is it all  
Or nothing at all  
When you reach the bottom it's now or never  
Is it all  
Or are we just friends  
Is this how it ends  
With a simple telephone call  
You leave me here with nothing  
  
Cause you and I  
Could lose it all if you've got no more room  
No more inside for me in your life  
  
Cause I want it all  
Or nothing at all  
There's nowhere left to fall  
It's now or never  
  
Is it all  
Or nothing at all  
When you reach the bottom it's now or never  
Is it all  
Or are we just friends  
Is this how it ends  
With a simple telephone call  
You leave me here with nothing at all

I am lying alone with my head on the phone  
Thinking of you till it hurts  
I know you're hurt too  
But what else can we do  
Tormented and torn apart  
  
I wish I could carry your smile in my heart  
For times when my life seems so low  
It would make me believe what tomorrow could bring  
When today doesn't really know, doesn't really know  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm all out of love, I'm so lost without you  
I know you were right, believing for so long  
I'm all out of love, what am I without you  
I can't be too late to say that  
I was so wrong  
  
I want you to come back and carry me home  
Away from this long lonely nights  
I'm reaching for you, are you feeling it too  
Does the feeling seem oh, so right  
  
And what would you say if I called on you now  
And said that I can't hold on?  
There's no easy way, it gets harder each day  
Please love me or I'll be gone, I'll be gone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, what are you thinking of  
What are you thinking of  
What are you thinking of  
What are you thinking of  
  
[Chorus]

Spend all your time  
Waiting for that  
Second chance  
For a break that  
Would make it okay  
There's always one reason  
To feel not good enough  
And it's hard at  
The end of the day  
I need some distraction  
Oh beautiful release  
Memory seeps  
From my veins  
Let me be empty  
And weightless and maybe  
I'll find some peace tonight  
In the arms of an angel  
Fly away from here  
From this dark  
Cold hotel room  
And the endlessness  
That you fear  
You are pulled  
From the wreckage  
Of your silent reverie  
You're in the  
Arms of the angel  
May you find  
Some comfort there  
  
So tired of the straight line  
And everywhere you turn  
There's vultures and  
  
Thieves at your back  
And the storm  
Keeps on twisting  
You keep on  
Building the lie  
That you make up  
For all that you lack  
It don't make no difference  
Escaping one last time  
It's easier to  
Believe in this  
Sweet madness oh  
This glorious sadness  
That brings me  
To my knees  
  
In the arms of an angel  
Fly away from here  
From this dark  
Cold hotel room  
And the endlessness  
That you fear  
You are pulled  
From the wreckage  
Of your silent reverie  
You're in the  
Arms of the angel  
May you find  
Some comfort there  
You're in the  
Arms of the angel  
May you find  
Some comfort here

And another life  
Maybe we see everything  
In a different light  
Like an endless summer  
And in the years from now  
We'll all be living  
The same old certain dream  
That we imagined would be  
  
Somewhere high  
Somewhere high above the clouds  
We could live there safe and sound  
Far away from where we are  
Yeah we'll find our star  
But maybe that's another world  
  
In another life  
We would fall in love you see  
And the sun would shine  
For you and me yeah  
Chasing the storm from the sky  
Altogether love would come and save us  
And we would let it take us  
  
Somewhere high  
Somewhere high above the clouds  
We could live there safe and sound  
Far away from where we are  
Yeah we'll find our star  
But maybe that's another world  
  
Far away from where we are  
Yeah we'll find our star  
But maybe that's another world

Mark:  
Once in a lifetime  
You look in someone's eyes  
And it feels like the world stops turning at once  
That's what it felt like for me  
I knew knew right away this day would be  
Standing together, believing forever  
Is there in our reach  
Chorus (Mark)  
'cause love is my witness  
I swear  
I'll be with you till the end  
Nothing in tear this love apart  
I'll put my hand upon my heart  
This is the promise I'll make to you  
Whatever comes we'll see it through  
Nothing can break it  
This feeling's too strong  
'cause love is my witness  
Shane:  
We've both known sorrow  
We've known heartache  
When our dreams for tomorrow  
Seem so far away  
But that brought us closer - yeah  
It brought us together  
So that we'd know the real thing  
That's why I can yeah - ye-eh-yeah  
Chorus: (Shane)  
'cause love is my witness  
I swear  
I'll be with you till the end  
Nothing in tear this love apart  
I'll put my hand upon my heart  
This is the promise I'll make to you  
Whatever comes we'll see it through  
Nothing can break it  
This feeling's too strong  
'cause love is my witness  
I know whatever comes to be  
Together we'll face the mystery  
Here in my heart, deep in my soul  
Somehow I know, I know  
'cause love is my witness  
I swear  
I'll be with you till the end  
Nothing in tear this love apart  
I'll put my hand upon my heart  
This is the promise I'll make to you  
(This is the promise I'll make to you)  
Whatever comes we'll see it through  
Nothing can break it  
This feeling's too strong  
'cause love is my witness  
Nothing can break it  
This feeling's too strong  
'cause love is my witness  

It's undeniable that we should be together  
It's unbelievable how I used to say that I'd fall never  
The basis is need to know if you don't know just how I feel  
Then let me show you now that I'm for real  
If all things in time time will reveal  
One - you're like a dream come true  
Two - just want to be with you  
Three - Girl its plain to see that you're the only one for me  
Four - repeat steps one through three  
Five - make you fall in love with me  
  
If ever I believe my work is done then  
I'll start back at one  
So incredible the way things work themselves out  
And all emotional once you know that its all about, hey  
And undesirable for us to be apart  
Never would of made it very far  
Cause you know you got the keys to my heart  
  
Say farewell to the dark of night  
I see the coming of the sun  
I feel like a little child whose life has just begun  
You came and breathed new life  
Into this lonely heart of mine  
You threw out the life line just in the nick of time

Not sure if you know this  
But when we first met  
I got so nervous I couldn't speak  
In that very moment  
I found the one and  
My life had found it's missing piece  
  
So as long as I live I love you  
Will have and hold you  
You look so beautiful in white  
And from now til my very last breath  
This day I'll cherish  
You look so beautiful in white  
Tonight  
  
What we have is timeless  
My love is endless  
And with this ring I  
Say to the world  
You're my every reason  
You're all that I believe in  
With all my heart I mean every word  
  
So as long as I live I love you  
Will haven and hold you  
You look so beautiful in white  
And from now til my very last breath  
This day I'll cherish  
You look so beautiful in white  
Tonight  
  
Oooh oh  
You look so beautiful in white  
  
So beautiful in white  
Tonight  
  
And if a daughter is what our future holds  
I hope she has your eyes  
Finds love like you and I did  
Yeah, and when she falls in love, we'll let her go  
I'll walk her down the aisle  
She'll look so beautiful in white  
  
You look so beautiful in white  
  
So as long as I live I love you  
Will haven and hold you  
You look so beautiful in white  
And from now til my very last breath  
This day I'll cherish  
You look so beautiful in white  
Tonight  
  
You look so beautiful in white  
Tonight

All things come to those who wait  
Sometimes they just come too late  
And if we never speak again  
I don't wanna make that mistake  
We never seem to find  
The place or time  
To say what's on our minds so  
  
[Chorus]  
Tell me everything now  
Don't leave anything out  
I'll tell you all my fears  
My mistakes  
Before it's too late  
  
I don't wanna wake up one day  
Wondering if I shied away  
From something that once seemed so hard  
One thing that's so simple to say  
Why do you always hide  
Your tears when you cry?  
Isn't it time you try to  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Before it's too late  
Before it's too late  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Before it's too late  
Before it's too late

My mama said nothing would break me or lead me astray  
Who would have guessed I'd let my mind drift so far away  
You always said I was a dreamer now it's dead  
I'm dreaming of things that's making my mind go crazy  
Small things like  
  
When I call you at home and he answers the phone  
Or I get your machine and I don't hear me  
When I lie in my bed with the thoughts in my head  
When we danced and we sang and we laughed all night  
  
Oh the bop bop baby please don't let me go  
Can't live my life this way  
Oh the bop bop baby please just let me know  
And put my mind at ease for sure  
  
On a love train  
20 odd years now  
I got off today  
But nobody said the stop that I've taken  
Was a stop too late  
Now I'm alone I'm thinking of stupid  
Hurtful small things like  
  
When I call you at home and he answers the phone  
Or I get your machine and I don't hear me  
When I lie in my bed with the thoughts in my head  
When we danced and we sang and we laughed all night  
  
Oh the bop bop baby please don't let me go  
Can't live my life this way  
Oh the bop bop baby please just let me know  
And put my mind at ease for sure  
  
Maybe it's time to say goodbye  
Maybe it's time to let this lie  
This is when we must set things right  
Now that we've gone our separate ways  
I just can't live these desperate days  
This is what I've been trying to say  
  
Oh the bop bop baby please don't let me go  
Can't live my life this way  
Oh the bop bop baby please just let me know  
And put my mind at ease for sure

Baby you're so beautiful  
And when I'm near you I can't breathe  
A girl like you gets who she wants  
When she wants it  
You're so out of my league  
I show you no emotion  
Don't let you see what you're doin' to me  
Imagine the two of us together  
But I've been livin' in reality  
  
Fear of rejection, kept my love inside  
But time is running out, so damn my  
Foolish pride  
  
[Chorus:]  
Don't care if you think I'm crazy  
Doesn't matter if it tums out bad  
'Cause I've got no fear of losin' you  
You can't lose what you never had  
  
Rules are made for breaking  
Nothin' ventured, nothin' gained  
I'll be no worse off then I am right now  
And I might never get the chance again  
  
Tried to fight it but it cannot be denied  
Told my heart I didn't want you but I lied  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Now I'm gonna confess that I love you  
I been keepin' it inside feelin' I could die  
Now if you turn away then that's o.k.  
At least we'll have a moment before  
You say good-bye  
  
Here on the outside lookin' in  
Don't want to stay dreamin' 'bout  
What could have been  
I need to hear you speak my name  
Even if you shoot me down in flames

We were still in high school  
When I first met you  
Even then you were the prettiest girl  
That I ever knew  
And we carved our name on  
Everything that we could find  
The way that all kids do  
And although time has passed  
I still get surprised  
At the pulling in my chest  
When I know you're coming by  
If this feeling's proving anything  
It's not everything  
Is gonna change with time  
You're still mine  
  
[Chorus]  
Did you know when you're around  
My heart won't it can't slow down  
It beats so hard it makes it hard  
To catch my breath, to catch my breath  
  
Don't ever ask me if I'm sorry  
Or that I'm here with you  
Baby you can bet  
I don't regret the girls I never knew  
Every day's another first  
Another change for me  
To fall in love with you  
And I do  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh... When you're with me  
I stop seeing  
Any way to fail how do I explain  
I try to tell you what I'm feeling  
But how do I when all words pale  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
To catch my breath, to catch my breath  
To catch my breath, to catch my breath

Your mouth is dry  
The moon is shining  
The night is cold and lonely  
For you this must be frightening  
  
Since you moved down my spine,  
There's something wrong in the shade of mine  
Let's do it one more time  
You let me hear in this bed of mine  
  
Give me one good reason why  
As you're spare  
Spare your throat tonight  
Give me one good reason why  
I should give you,  
Give you love tonight  
  
Bodies shaking  
(Bodies shaking)  
Darkness fading  
(Darkness fading)  
Yeah!  
  
Can you please keep screaming,  
Screaming blood for me  
  
The sun is up  
I see things clearly,  
Your bruises show so bloody  
For me this must be tempting  
  
Since you moved down my spine,  
There's something wrong in the shade of mine  
Let's do it one more time  
You let me hear in this bed of mine  
  
Give me one good reason why  
As you're spare,  
Spare your throat tonight  
Give me one good reason why  
I should give you,  
Give you love tonight  
  
Bodies shaking  
(Bodies shaking)  
Darkness fading  
(Darkness fading)  
Yeah!  
  
Can you please keep screaming,  
Screaming blood for me  
  
One good reason  
Give me one good reason why  
One good reason  
Give me one good reason why  
  
Give me one good reason why  
As you're spare,  
Spare your throat tonight  
Give me one good reason why  
I should give you,  
Give you love tonight.  
  
Bodies shaking  
(Bodies shaking)  
Darkness fading  
(Darkness fading)  
Yeah!  
  
Can you please keep screaming,  
Screaming blood for me.

Hey, girl, it's all over town  
So how come I'm the last to find out  
That you're leaving, with some other guy  
Help me understand why oh why  
  
Tell, me, what he does for you  
Is there something that I didn't do  
All those late nights, I left you alone  
I was working on our happy home  
  
And then I come to find out  
That you're about to walk out  
  
Baby, why do you give me such a hard time  
I know he said he loves you more than I  
That's a lie  
Let me change your mind  
Oh  
Baby, stop before you make a big mistake  
Stop before you turn and walk away  
Give me time  
Let me change your mind  
Oh  
  
I, know, if you ever leave  
Baby someday, you'll look back and see  
That it's right here, that you should've been  
But you can run back to me  
  
And don't make me look for someone new  
When all I wanted is you  
  
Baby, why do you give me such a hard time  
I know he said he loves you more than I  
That's a lie  
Let me change your mind  
Oh  
Baby, stop before you make a big mistake  
Stop before you turn and walk away  
Give me time  
Let me change your mind  
Oh  
  
Oh  
Oh  
Oh  
  
Don't make me look for someone new  
When all I wanted is you  
  
Baby, why do you give me such a hard time  
I know he said he loves you more than I  
That's a lie  
Let me change your mind  
Oh  
Baby, stop before you make a big mistake  
Stop before you turn and walk away  
Give me time  
Let me change your mind  
Oh  
  
Oh  
Oh  
Oh  
Oh  
Oh  
Oh...  
Oh...

There's something in the silence  
I never used to feel  
There's something about knowing  
That tells you this is real  
When you're close  
All I know I don't want to let you go  
  
[Chorus]  
Hello happiness  
Tell me where you've been  
I missed the sound of your voice  
Missed the touch of your skin  
It's no secret I'm Not who I used to be  
Anyone can see  
You're the difference in me  
Oh the difference  
  
I'm standing at your doorstep  
Let me look into your eyes  
We could strip away the secrets  
Between you and me tonight  
  
Won't you say it's OK  
Let the world just fade away  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah the difference in me  
The difference  
When you're close all I know I don't want to let you go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah the difference in me  
Oh the difference  
There's something in the silence I never used to feel

Hello, let me know if you hear me  
Hello, if you want to be near, let me know  
And I'll never let you go  
  
Hey love,  
When you ask what I feel, I say love  
When you ask how I know, I say trust  
  
And if that's not enough'  
  
It's every little thing you do  
That makes me fall in love with you  
There isn't a way that I can show you  
Ever since I've come to know you  
It's every little thing you say  
That makes me want to feel this  
There's not a thing that I can point to  
'Cause it's every little thing you do  
  
Don't ask why,  
Let's just feel what we feel, 'cause sometimes,  
It's the secret that keeps it alive  
  
But if you need a reason why'  
  
It's every little thing you do  
That makes me fall in love with you  
There isn't a way that I can show you  
Ever since I've come to know you  
It's every little thing you say  
That makes me want to feel this  
There's not a thing that I can point to  
'Cause it's every little thing you do  
  
Is it your smile or your laugh or your heart?  
Does it really matter why I love you?  
Anywhere there a crowd, you stand out  
Can't you see why they can't ignore you?  
If you want to know  
Why I can't let go  
Let me explain to you  
That every little dream comes true with every little thing you do  
  
It's everything, everything you do  
That makes me fall in love with you  
It's everything, everything you say  
That makes me feel this way

It's never too hard to find the words  
The words to say to you  
  
You make it so easy just to talk  
The way we talk things through  
You're never too tired to care  
You're never too busy  
Just to be there  
And when I smile my feelings show  
So everybody, everybody knows  
  
[Chorus]  
And everybody knows this love's for sure  
There's no searching anymore  
And no-one never doubts you're mine, I'm yours  
It's the one thing that's for sure  
And everyone we know says all the time  
They wish they had a love like yours and mine  
And everybody knows  
  
Even people in love said I'm a fool  
For loving you too much  
But we were the exception to the rule  
For us it's not enough  
They used to say we're out of touch  
Now everyone wants to like us  
Not afraid to let it show  
So everybody, everybody knows  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Like yours and mine  
The bridges all divides  
A love to conquer time  
When everybody knows  
  
[Chorus x3]

Everybody's looking for that something  
One thing that makes it all complete  
You find it in the strangest places  
Places you never knew it could be  
  
Some find it in the face of their children  
Some find it in their lover's eyes  
Who can deny the joy it brings  
When you found that special thing  
You're flying without wings  
  
Some find it sharing every morning  
Some in their solitary lives  
You find it in the words of others  
A simple line can make you laugh or cry  
  
You find it in the deepest friendship  
The kind you cherish all your life  
And when you know how much that means  
You've found that special thing  
You're flying without wings  
  
So impossible as they may seem  
You've got to fight for every dream  
'Cause who's to know  
Which one you let go  
Would have made you complete  
  
Well, for me it's waking up beside you  
To watch the sunrise on your face  
To know that I can say I love you  
In any given time or place  
It's little things that only I know  
Those are the things that make you mine  
  
And it's like flying without wings  
'Cause you're my special thing  
I'm flying without wings  
  
And you're the place my life begins  
And you'll be where it ends  
I'm flying without wings  
And that's the joy you bring  
I'm flying without wings

Baby, I know the story,  
I've seen the picture,  
It's written all over your face  
Tell me, what's the secret that you've been hiding?  
And who's gonna take my place?  
I should have seen it coming,  
I should have read the signs  
Anyway, I guess it's over  
  
[Chorus]  
Can't believe that I'm a fool again  
I thought this love would never end,  
How was I to know?  
You never told me  
Can't believe that I'm a fool again,  
And I who thought you were my friend,  
How was I to know?  
You never told me  
  
Baby, you should've called me,  
When you were lonely,  
When you needed me to be there  
Sadly, you never gave me  
Too many chances to show you  
How much I care  
Ooh, should have seen it coming,  
I should have read the signs  
Anyway, I guess it's over  
  
[Chorus]  
  
About the pain and the tears  
Ooh, If I could,  
I would, turn back the time  
Ooh yeah I should have seen it coming  
I should have read the signs  
Anyway, I guess it's over  
  
[Chorus]

  
  
  
  
  
  
I'll be loving you forever,  
  
Deep inside my heart you leave me never,  
  
Even if you took my heart,  
  
And tore it apart,  
  
I would love you still, forever,  
  
  
You are the sun,  
  
You are my light,  
  
And you're the last thing on my mind, before I go to sleep at night,  
  
You're always round,  
  
When I'm in need,  
  
When troubles on my mind,  
  
You put my soul at ease,  
  
  
There is no one in this world,  
  
Who can love me like you do,  
  
That is the reason that I,  
  
want to spend forever with you,  
  
  
I'll be loving you forever,  
  
Deep inside my heart you leave me never,  
  
Even if you took my heart,  
  
And tore it apart,  
  
I would love you still, forever,  
  
  
We've had a fun,  
  
We've made mistakes,  
  
But who'd have guessed along that road, we'd learn to give and take,  
  
It's so much more than I could have dreamed,  
  
Cause you've make loving you, so easy for me,  
  
  
There is no one in this world,  
  
Who can love me like you do,  
  
That is the reason that I,  
  
want to spend forever with you,  
  
  
I'll be loving you forever,  
  
Deep inside my heart you leave me never,  
  
Even if you took my heart,  
  
And tore it apart,  
  
I would love you still, forever,  
  
  
And girl I pray you leave me, never,  
  
  
Cause this is the world, where lovers often go astray,  
  
But if we learn each other, we won't go that way,  
  
So put your doubts aside,  
  
Do what it takes to make it right,  
  
I love you, forever, no-one can tear us apart,  
  
  
I'll be loving you forever, ( forever)  
  
Deep inside my heart you leave me never,  
  
Even if you took my heart, ( took my heart girl)  
  
And tore it apart, ( you tore it apart now)  
  
I would love you still, forever,  
  
And I'll be loving you forever, (forever)  
  
Deep inside my heart you leave me never,  
  
Even if you took my heart, ( you took my heart girl)  
  
And tore it apart, ( you tore it apart now)  
  
I would love you still, forever,  
  
I'll be loving you forever,  
  
Deep inside my heart you leave me never,  
  
Even if you took my heart,  
  
And tore it apart,  
  
I would love you still, forever.  
  

A fragile heart, was broken before,  
I don't think it could endure another pain,  
But there's a voice from deep inside of you,  
That's calling out to make you realize,  
That this new bond gives inspiration,  
To all that feel no love appeal no more,  
So how can I break this wall around you,  
That's aiding both our hearts to grow in pain.  
  
So forget your past,  
And we can dream tomorrow,  
Save our hearts for care and loving too,  
It's hard I know, but oh one thing's for sure,  
Don't go and break this fragile heart.  
  
A hurting mind in need of emotion,  
I don't think I could endure another pain,  
But baby in you I've found affection,  
Affection I have never felt before.  
  
So don't let your past,  
Destroy what comes tomorrow,  
Don't go and break this fragile heart.  
  
With all this fire that burns between us,  
There's so much to lose,  
Yet so much more to gain,  
And if I could choose the world around me,  
The world I choose would all revolve around you,  
So help me complete the game inside me,  
And help to mend this fragile heart

Everybody needs a little time away  
I heard her say  
From each other  
Even lovers need a holiday  
Far away from each other  
Hold me now  
It's hard for me to say I'm sorry  
I just want you to stay  
  
After all that we've been through,  
I will make it up to you  
I promise to  
And after all that's been said and done  
You're just a part of me I can't let go  
  
Couldn't stand to be kept away  
Just for the day  
From your body  
Wouldn't want to be swept away  
Far away from the one that I love  
  
Hold me now  
It's hard for me to say I'm sorry  
I just want you to know  
  
Hold me now  
I really want to tell you I'm sorry  
I could never let you go  
After all that we've been through,  
I will make it up to you  
I promise to  
  
And after all that's been said and done  
You're just a part of me I can't let go  
After all that we've been through,  
I will make it up to you,  
I promise to  
  
And after all that's been said and done  
You're just a part of me I can't let go  
  
You're gonna be the lucky one  
  
Everybody needs a little time away  
I heard her say

[Chorus]  
Have you ever loved somebody so much  
It makes you cry?  
Have you ever needed something so bad  
You can't sleep at night?  
Have you ever tried to find the words  
But they don't come out right?  
Have you ever?  
  
Have you ever?  
  
Have you ever been in love  
Been in love so bad  
You'd do anything  
To make them understand?  
Have you ever had someone  
Steal your heart away?  
You'd give anything  
To make them feel the same?  
Have you ever searched for words  
To get you in their heart  
But you don't know what to say  
And you don't know where to start?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Have you ever found the one  
You've dreamed of all your life?  
You'd do just about anything  
To look into their eyes?  
Have you finally found the one  
  
You've given your heart to  
Only to find that one  
Won't give their heart to you?  
Have you ever closed your eyes and  
Dreamed that they were there  
  
And all you can do is wait  
For that day when they will care?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Bridge]  
What do I gotta do to get you in my arms, baby?  
What do I gotta say to get to your heart  
To make you understand  
How I need you next to me?  
Gotta get you in my world  
Cause, baby, I can't sleep  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Have you ever?

In the morning light  
Half awake and half asleep  
Have you ever laid there thinking  
Was it all a dream?  
But you reach out and she's there  
Every moment, everywhere  
Have you ever been in love?  
  
Have you ever felt  
How far a heart can fall  
Have you ever stayed up waiting  
For a telephone call  
Just to hear her say hello  
'Cause you miss each other so  
Have you ever been in love?  
  
Have there been times to laugh  
And times you really want to cry  
Finding reasons to believe her  
'Cause you'd die a little if she lied  
And when in times of doubt  
Have you ever tried to work it out  
But still she leaves you wondering  
What it's all about  
  
And when she's far away  
Have you ever felt the need to stray  
And tried and then discovered  
It just doesn't pay  
'Cause with her, you can be true  
And with her, you can be you  
Have you ever been in love?  
  
Have there been times to laugh  
And times you really want to cry  
Finding reasons to believe her  
'Cause you'd die a little if she lied  
And when in times of doubt  
Have you ever tried to work it out  
But still she leaves you wondering  
What its all about  
  
And when the night comes down  
Can you call your house a home  
Do you dream you're still together  
And wake up alone  
Have you ever been in love  
The way that I'm in love  
Have you ever been in love?  
Have you ever been in love?

Girl I love to watch you  
You're like candy to my eyes  
Like a movie that you've seen  
But you gotta watch just one more time  
But that smile you're wearing  
It's a beautiful disguise  
It's just something you put on to hide the emptiness inside  
And you seem so lonely  
  
But you don't have to anymore  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If you're a heart without a home  
Rebel without a cause  
If you feel as though  
You're always stranded on the shore  
Like a thief in the night  
Let me steal your heart away  
Baby if for reasons, what you're looking for  
I'll be yours  
  
I'll be yours  
  
I'll be a new sensation  
One you never had before  
I got a feeling if I gave you some  
You'd probably want some more  
Did you know that Baby  
You're the bluebird in my sky  
I only wanna make you happy cause  
I love to see you fly  
  
And if you feel lonely  
You don't have to anymore  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'll be yours, I'll be yours  
  
I'll be the raft in the tide  
I'll be yours  
I'll be the truth in the light  
And what's more  
When no one opens the door  
I'll be the hope that you're looking for  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'll be yours

It's 99 degrees and the temperature is creeping up  
I felt your foundation via great amount in moderate  
I've almost got you there so let me take you all the way  
a taste is stimulating keep you hot like  
  
[Chorus]

Come hold your hands above your head and let them  
levitate  
And be hypnotic and the trip won't stop  
  
[Chorus]  
Like what (take it till you're high and low)

I felt your foundation via great amount in moderate  
Come hold your hands above your head and let them  
levitate  
And be hypnotic and the trip won't stop  
  
Like what (take it till you're high and low)  
Like how (system overload)  
Like who (sure you wanna rock the boat)  
And hit you with the real thing  
  
What (rock you from the left to right)  
Like how (electro paradise)  
Like who (if you wanna up your line)  
And hit you with the real thing  
  
Like what (take it till you're high and low)  
Like how (system overload)  
Like who (sure you wanna rock the boat)  
And hit you with the real thing  
  
What (rock you from the left to right)  
Like how (electro paradise)  
Like who (if you wanna up your line)  
And hit you with the real thing

True lovers never take it slowly  
When they've found the one and only  
Nothing can replace this feeling  
Knowing someone loves you  
  
It's painted with the pain and glory  
Taking from a known sad story  
Laying out my life before me  
Fearing the unknown  
  
Sharing never showed me much appeal  
And now I'm only praying it's for real  
  
So how does it feel  
When I hold you in my arms  
And you're lying next to me  
Never wanting you to leave  
Until I'll tell you how it feels  
To be cradled like my dreams  
And to know that you love me  
No more wasting time in asking other people  
How does it feel  
  
How does it feel  
  
Forever taken you for granted  
You give me everything I wanted  
I'm so afraid that I might lose you  
But time will let us see  
If everything is real I'm feeling  
Well maybe we've been only dreaming  
And if it's gonna die to save it  
'cause baby I believe  
  
Nothing in the world could make it right  
'cause baby loving you brings me to life  
  
And how does it feel  
When I hold you in my arms  
And you're lying next to me  
Never wanting you to leave  
Until I'll tell you how it feels  
To be cradled like my dreams  
And to know that you love me  
No more wasting time in asking other people  
How does it feel  
  
Whoa, whoa, whoa  
  
Nothing in the world could feel this right  
'cause baby you're the best thing in my life  
  
How does it feel  
When I hold you in my arms  
And you're lying next to me  
Never wanting you to leave  
Until I'll tell you how it feels  
To be cradled like my dreams  
And to know that you love me  
No more wasting time in asking other people  
  
How does it feel

You said goodbye  
I fell apart  
I fell from all we had  
To I never knew  
I needed you so bad  
You need to  
Let things go  
I know, you told me so  
I've been through hell  
To break the spell  
  
Why did I ever  
Let you slip away?  
Can't stand another day  
Without you  
Without the feeling  
I once knew  
  
I cry silently  
I cry inside of me  
I cry hopelessly  
'Cause I know  
I'll never breathe  
Your love again  
I cry  
'Cause you're not  
Here with me  
I cry  
'Cause I'm lonely  
As can be  
I cry hopelessly  
'Cause I know  
I'll never breathe  
Our love again  
  
If you could see me now  
You would know just how  
How hard I try  
Not to wonder why  
  
I wish I could believe  
In something new  
Oh please  
Somebody tell me  
It's not true  
(Oh girl)  
I'll never be over you  
  
Why did I ever  
Let you slip away?  
Can't stand another day  
Without you  
Without the feeling  
I once knew  
  
I cry silently  
I cry inside of me  
I cry hopelessly  
'Cause I know  
I'll never breathe  
Your love again  
I cry  
'Cause you're not  
Here with me  
I cry  
'Cause I'm lonely  
As can be  
I cry hopelessly  
'Cause I know  
I'll never breathe  
Your love again  
  
If I could have you  
Back tomorrow  
If I could lose  
The pain and sorrow  
I would do just anything  
To make you see  
You still love me  
  
I cry silently  
I cry inside of me  
I cry hopelessly  
'Cause I know  
I'll never breathe  
Your love again  
I cry  
'Cause you're not  
Here with me  
I cry  
'Cause I'm lonely  
As can be  
I cry hopelessly  
'Cause I know  
I'll never breathe  
Your love again

Tell me can you feel my heart beat  
Tell me as i kneel down at your feet  
I knew there would come a time  
When these two hearts would  
entwined just put your hand in mine  
Forever  
  
For so long I have been an island  
When no-one could ever  
Reach the shores  
And we've got a whole lifetime to share  
And I'll always be there, darling this i swear  
  
[Chorus]  
So please believe me  
For these words I say are true  
And don't deny me  
A lifetime loving you  
And if you ask will I be true  
Do I give my all to you  
Then I will say I do  
  
I'm ready to begin this journey  
Well I'm with you with every step you take  
And we've got a whole lifetime to share  
And I'll always be there  
Darling this i swear  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Come on just take my hand oh come on  
Lets make a stand for our love  
But I know this is so hard to believe  
So please  
  
[Chorus]

My love, my heart  
Oh bruised and broken, all alone when we're apart  
I die inside,  
Oh this room is like a battlefield of love tonight  
I know I should be stronger but I lose all control  
Fighting with myself tryna hide what you don't know  
  
But I get weak  
I'm giving it all away  
I know it's not wise to leave myself so opened but  
All the rules get broken in your eyes  
I give it all up to you  
And everything that's been keeping me together  
Brings me to my knees  
I get weak  
  
One look, one touch  
Oh I'm helplessly pretending you don't mean that much  
It gets so hard  
The waiting here forever with this shattered heart  
Lying to myself tryna act like I don't care, no  
The way it's killing me every time that you're not there  
  
Cause I get weak  
I'm giving it all away  
I know it's not wise to leave myself so opened but  
All the rules get broken in your eyes  
I give it all up to you  
And everything that's been keeping me together  
Brings me to my knees  
I get weak  
  
I get weak  
And all the walls I've been building up  
Just crack and then break when you're around  
I get weak  
And nothing I do to fight it matters now  
  
I get weak  
I'm giving it all away  
I know it's not wise to leave myself so opened but  
All the rules get broken in your eyes  
I give it all up to you  
And everything that's been keeping me together  
Brings me to my knees  
  
I get weak (oh)  
I get weak (oh)  
I get weak (oh)  
  
All the rules get broken in your eyes  
I give it all up to you  
And everything that's been keeping me together  
Brings me to my knees

[Shane:]  
I have a dream, a song to sing  
To help me cope with anything  
If you see the wonder (wonder) of a fairy tale  
You can take the future even if you fail

Just a smile and there's no way back  
Can hardly believe it (yeah)  
But there's an angel and she's calling me  
Reaching for my heart  
  
I know, that I'll be ok now  
This time it's real  
  
I lay my love on you  
It's all I want to do  
Every time I breathe I feel brand new  
You open up my heart  
Show me all your love, and walk right through  
As I lay my love on you  
  
I was lost in a lonely place  
Could hardly believe it (yeah)  
Holding on to yesterdays  
Far, far too long  
  
Now I believe it's okay cause  
This time it's real  
  
I lay my love on you  
It's all I want to do  
Every time I breathe I feel brand new  
You open up my heart  
Show me all your love, and walk right through  
As I lay my love on you  
  
I never knew that love could feel so good  
  
Like a once in a lifetime  
You change my world  
  
I lay my love on you'.

The loveliness of Paris seems somehow sadly gay  
The glory that was Rome is of another day  
I've been terribly alone and forgotten in Manhattan  
I'm going home to my city by the Bay  
I left my heart in San Francisco  
High on a hill, it calls to me  
To be where little cable cars climb halfway to the stars  
The morning fog may chill the air, I don't care  
  
My love waits there in San Francisco  
Above the blue and windy sea  
When I come home to you, San Francisco  
Your golden sun will shine for me  

Another day without your smile  
Another day just passes by  
But now I know how much it means  
For you to stay right here with me  
The time we spent apart will make our love grow stronger  
But it hurts so bad I can't take it any longer  
  
I wanna grow old with you  
I wanna die lying in your arms  
I wanna grow old with you  
I wanna be looking in your eyes  
I wanna be there for you, sharing in everything you do  
I wanna grow old with you  
  
A thousand miles between us now  
It causes me to wonder how  
Our love tonight remains so strong  
It makes our risk right all along  
The time we spent apart will make our love grow stronger  
But it hurt so bad I can't take it any longer  
  
I wanna grow old with you  
I wanna die lying in your arms  
I wanna grow old with you  
I wanna be looking in your eyes  
I wanna be there for you, sharing in everything you do  
I wanna grow old with you  
  
Things can come and go  
I know but  
Baby I believe  
Something's burning strong between us  
Makes it clear to me  
  
I wanna grow old with you  
I wanna die lying in your arms  
I wanna grow old with you  
I wanna be looking in your eyes  
I wanna be there for you, sharing in everything you do  
I wanna grow old with you

You're no angel, I'm no saint, if we were  
We wouldn't be in this place tonight  
  
Lost and lonely, scared and confused  
We both have a past, nothing to lose, tonight  
Well it cuts like a knife these bad luck blues  
We both got scars from the hell we been through  
Somebody's gotta win, somebody's gotta lose  
  
So let's roll the dice, one more time  
Take a chance on love again tonight  
Risk it all, lay it on the line  
Let the skeletons fight for life  
Tonight, hold on tight, as we collide  
  
Reconnected, feelin' no pain  
Seeking shelter like a spark in the rain, tonight (ooh yeah)  
Worn and weathered, scared to go home  
We're here together, but still all alone, tonight (uh uh yeah)  
And there's no need to lie, we've both been abused  
The love and the pain, the cocaine and booze, now  
Most people don't, but some people do  
  
So let's roll the dice, one more time  
Take a chance on love again tonight  
Risk it all, lay it on the line  
Let the skeletons fight for life  
Tonight, hold on tight, as we collide

Bryan:  
Your life's hard enough  
And your not strong enough  
To be bleeding from your heart  
The strain has got to much  
I feel your losing touch  
You let your inner beauty slide  
And if I'm gone tomorrow  
Would you feel my sorrow?  
Don't you know that I'll be there?  
Till the bitter end  
Won't you be my baby coz  
Chorus:  
I won't let you down [I only want to be a part of you]  
No I won't let you down[Ill do everything you want me to]  
Ill never let you down[Each day I'm falling more in love with you]  
You don't know my mind  
But your on it all the time  
Mark:  
Must have been a fight  
To Keep your dreams alive  
When your as far into his wounds  
And if he's gone tomorrow  
I won't feel no sorrow  
Don't you know Ill bring you  
Woah a better ending  
To your helpless story because  
Chorus:  
I won't let you down [I only want to be a part of you]  
No I won't let you down[Ill do everything you want me to]  
I'll never let you down[Each day I'm falling more in love with you]  
You don't know my mind  
But your all the other time  
Mark:  
You don't know my mind  
But it don't make no difference  
Running all the time  
No no no  
No I'll never let you down  
No I'll never let you down  
Mark:  
And if he's gone tomorrow  
I won't feel no sorrow  
Don't you know Ill bring you  
Woah a better ending  
To your helpless story because  
Chorus:  
I won't let you down [I only want to be a part of you]  
No I won't let you down[Ill do everything you want me to]  
I won't let you down[Each day I'm falling more in love with you]  
Ill never let you down  
  

Day after day  
Time pass away  
And I just can't get you out my mind  
Nobody knows  
I hide it inside  
I keep on searching  
But I can't find  
The courage to show  
To letting you know  
I never felt so much love before  
And once again  
I'm thinking about  
Taking the easy way out  
  
[Chorus]  
But if I let you go  
I will never know  
What's my life would be  
Holding you close to me  
Will I ever see  
You smiling back at me  
How will I know  
If I let you go  
  
Night after night  
I hear myself say  
What can't this feeling just fade away  
There's no one like you  
Can speak to my heart  
It's just a shame we worlds apart  
I'm too shy to ask  
I'm too proud to lose  
But sooner or later  
I've got to choose  
And once again  
I'm thinking about  
taking the easy way out  
  
[Chorus]

Always you will be part of me  
And I will forever feel your strength  
When I need it most  
You're gone now, gone but not forgotten  
I can't say this to your face  
But I know you hear  
  
I'll see you again  
You never really left  
I feel you walk beside me  
I know I'll see you again  
  
When I'm lost, I'm missing you like crazy  
And I tell myself I'm so blessed  
To have had you in my life, my life  
  
I'll see you again  
You never really left  
I feel you walk beside me  
I know I'll see you again  
  
When I had the time to tell you  
I never thought I'd live to see the day  
When the words I should have said  
Would come to haunt me  
In my darkest hour I tell myself  
I'll see you again  
  
I'll see you again  
You never really left  
I feel you walk beside me  
I know I'll see you again  
  
I'll see you again  
You never really left  
I feel you walk beside me  
I know I'll see you again  
  
I will see you again  
I'll see you again  
I miss you like crazy  
You're gone but not forgotten  
I'll never forget you  
Someday I'll see you again  
I feel you walk beside me  
Never leave you, yeah  
Gone but not forgotten  
I feel you by my side  
No this is not goodbye

Come now yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Late last night I had a dream  
And it was then I seen her  
She didn't need no diamond rings  
Fancy cars, Versace things to please her  
She's my perfect girl  
And I call her my imaginary diva  
Every girl she passes by  
Just can't deny that they would love to be her  
All the guys comparing sizes  
Tucking shirts in, fixing ties to please her  
She's my perfect girl  
Exclusive to my world  
No you can't get her  
She's my imaginary diva  
Shine on imaginary diva  
Shine on into this world  
Join us in our imagination  
Help yourself believe in all you have heard  
All you have to do is close your eyes  
Forget real life and fantasize  
Erase bad thoughts start to replace, come on  
Create your own amazing place  
She's a real time girl  
In my imaginary world  
Take a good look at her  
She's my imaginary diva  
Shine on imaginary diva  
Shine on into this world  
Join us in our imagination  
Help yourself believe in all you have heard  
So listen up this so called classy lady's  
Sipping fizz in VIP bars  
She could teach a thing or to  
To you, your outfit, attitude and Visa  
She's my imaginary diva  
Shine on imaginary diva  
Shine on into this world  
Join us in our imagination  
Help yourself believe in all you have heard  
(Help yourself believe in all you have heard)  
(Shine on)  
Shine on, shine on imaginary diva  
(Shine on)  
Shine on, shine on imaginary girl  
(Shine on)  
Shine on, shine on imaginary diva  
Help yourself believe in all you have heard  

For all I've been blessed with in this life  
There was an emptiness in me  
I was imprisoned by the power of gold  
With one honest touch you set me free  
  
[Chorus]  
Let the world stop turning  
Let the sun stop burning  
Let them tell me love's not worth going through  
If it all falls apart  
I will know deep in my heart  
The only dream that mattered had come true  
In this life, I was loved by you  
  
For every mountain I have climbed  
And ever raging river crossed  
You were the treasure that I longed to find Without you love I would be lost  
  
[Chorus]

There's a laugh in my eyes  
There's a waltz in my walk  
And it's been such a long time  
Since there was hope in my talk  
If you never knew  
What it is that's new... It's you  
  
Cause when your hands are in mine  
You set a fire that everyone can see  
And it's burning away  
Every bad memory  
To tell you the truth  
If it's something new... Baby it's you  
  
It's you in the morning  
It's you in the night  
A beautiful angel came down  
To light up my life  
  
The world's a different place  
Where nothings too hard to say  
And nothings to hard to do  
Never too much to go through  
To tell you the truth  
Everything that's new... Baby it's you  
  
It's you in the morning  
It's you in the night  
A beautiful angel came down  
To light up my life  
My life, my life  
Oh  
  
So if I get to grow old (oh if I get to grow old)  
With many years behind me (many years behind me)  
There's only one thing I want (ahh)  
One thing I need beside me  
For all that you are  
For everything you do  
For all that you've done  
Just for showing me the truth  
  
It's you  
It's you  
Baby it's you

Watching the clock on the wall  
Been a while since you called  
I can't help but wait  
It's late and I can't get no sleep  
Something's different this time  
It just doesn't feel right  
Have we broken in two?  
Am I really gonna lose you tonight?  
You come walking in  
Tears in your eyes  
Pretending like it's alright  
  
But I know you're leaving  
I know that smile  
I can tell you've been crying  
You're gonna say goodbye  
I wish I could stop you  
But you've made up your mind  
I beg you don't go  
But I already know you're leaving  
  
Where does the time go?  
Between goodbye and hello  
How did we come to this is there something we missed  
Along the way  
With your bags at the door  
I wanna pull you in close  
And hold you once more even though  
  
But I know you're leaving  
I know that smile  
I can tell you've been crying  
You're gonna say goodbye  
I wish I could stop you  
But you've made up your mind  
I beg you don't go  
But I already know you're leaving  
  
Here come the sleepless nights  
Here come the tears I'm gonna cry  
Here comes the last goodbye leaving us behind  
Oh this can't be right  
  
But I know you're leaving  
I know that smile  
I can tell you've been crying  
You're gonna say goodbye  
I wish I could stop you  
But you've made up your mind  
I beg you don't go  
But I already know you're leaving

  
  
  
  
I'll give the world to make you mine  
  
'Cause I can't go on without you this time  
  
What are you doing tonight baby?  
  
Lets make tonight special  
  
All I'm asking for is a little word  
  
I look in your eyes  
  
(And) baby i see  
  
You are the only one i ever need  
  
Right from the start you were  
  
There in my heart and soul  
  
Cause baby tonight  
  
we'll make it right  
  
we'll light some candlelight  
  
make it all right  
  
cause I can't go on without you this time..(this time)  
  
  
(CHORUS)  
  
So lets make tonight special  
  
Something beautiful that  
  
We'll always treasure  
  
Lets make tonight so right  
  
We will make it a night to remember  
  
All our lives  
  
  
Baby tonight  
  
I hold you tight  
  
We will be close by the fireside  
  
Baby I know  
  
So strong, baby strong  
  
The stars shine so bright  
  
The moon and the sky  
  
With you means more than life  
  
Since i met you  
  
My heart has been true to you  
  
  
CHORUS  
  
So lets make tonight special..  
  

This kind of love  
Is more than a lifeline  
For a man as weak as me  
Who has no  
Self believe  
  
This kind of love  
Is more than amazing  
For a man who  
Lost his way  
Who thought it was too late  
  
How did the sea  
How did  
The sea  
How did the sea get so rough  
I would've drowned  
I would've  
Drowned  
If you hadn't given me your love  
  
You're the light in the  
Dark  
You're the seat in the park  
You're the lighthouse  
You're the  
Lighthouse  
That I need  
You're the key to the door  
You're the Port in the  
Storm  
And I need to find a shore  
When I can't swim anymore  
You always guide  
Me back to solid ground  
You're my lighthouse  
  
This kind of love  
Is  
More than a feeling  
For a man who rarely cried  
I get all choked up each  
Time  
You say you love me  
You could've walked away  
Could've give my problems  
Back  
Could've left  
  
You took the chance  
  
How did the  
Waves  
How did the waves  
How did the waves get so high  
I would've  
Died  
I would've died  
If you hadn't loved me just in  
Time  
  
You're the light in the dark  
You're the seat in the  
Park  
You're the lighthouse  
You're the lighthouse  
That I  
Need  
You're the key to the door  
You're the Port in the Storm  
When I need to  
Find a shore  
Cos I can't swim anymore  
You always guide me back to solid  
Ground  
You're my lighthouse  
  
Yeah, I owe it all to you everything I have  
Right now  
I owe it all to you everything I didn't have you found  
Everytime take me  
Back to you  
  
You're the light in the dark  
You're the seat in the  
Park  
You're the lighthouse  
You're the lighthouse  
I need  
You're the  
Key to the door  
You're the Port in the Storm  
And I need to find the shore  
Cos  
I can't swim anymore  
You always guide me back to solid ground  
You're my  
Lighthouse

Loneliness is always looking for a friend  
It found me once and it has been around since then  
Loneliness is never waiting by the door  
It sweeps right through and it will never be ignored  
Why, why was I chosen?  
Why am I left without?  
  
The Love of my life, the love that I need  
The love that they say is in life for free  
The love of dreams, the love that I want  
Loneliness knows me by name  
  
Loneliness knows everything I keep inside  
My endless thoughts in the silence of the night  
Loneliness is the one who made me see  
Ain't nobody else who can make a change but me  
Why, why was I chosen?  
Why am I left without?  
  
The Love of my life, the love that I need  
The love that they say is in life for free  
The love of dreams, the love that I want  
Loneliness knows me by name  
  
Less is more and that would be the vacant space  
The cried out tears and a never ending maze  
I have found what only loneliness provides  
A strength within knowing I will find

There's no more waiting  
Holding out for love  
You are my god send  
That I have been forever dreaming of  
My angel from above  
  
Heaven knows  
I'm head over heels  
And it shows  
I've played every field I suppose  
But there's something about you  
When you're around  
Baby I have found  
I get lost in you  
  
What is this feeling  
I've never known before?  
That I should touch you  
Swearing to surrender ever more  
That's what I came here for  
  
Heaven knows  
I'm head over heels  
And it shows  
I've played every field I suppose  
But there's' something about you  
When you're around  
Baby I have found  
I get lost in your wonderful daze  
Lost in your wonderful ways  
Heaven knows  
  
Lost in you  
Heaven knows  
  
Oh, when you're around  
Baby I have found  
I get lost  
Heaven knows  
  
Heaven knows  
I'm head over heels  
And it shows  
I've played every field I suppose  
But there's something about you  
When you're around  
Baby I have found  
I get lost  
  
Heaven knows  
  
Heaven knows  
I'm head over heels  
And it shows  
I've played every field I suppose  
But there's something about you  
When you're around  
Baby I have found  
  
I get lost in you

I'd gladly walk across the desert  
With no shoes upon my feet  
To share with you the last bite of bread I had to eat  
I would swim back to save you  
In your sea of broken dreams  
When all your hopes are sinking  
Let me show you what love means  
  
[Chorus]  
Love can build a Bridge  
Between your heart and mine  
Love can build a Bridge  
Don't you think it's time?  
Don't you think it's time?  
  
I would whisper love so loudly  
Every heart could understand  
That love and only love  
Can join the tribes of man  
I would give my heart's desire  
So that you might see  
The first step is to realize  
That it all begins with you and me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When we stand together  
It's our finest hour  
We can do anything, anything  
Anything, anything  
Keep believin' in the power  
  
[Chorus]

Moon River wider than a mile  
I'm crossing you in style someday  
Oh, dream maker, you heartbreaker  
Wherever you're going, I'm going your way  
Two drifters off to see the world  
There's such a lot of world to see  
We're after the same rainbows end  
Waiting 'round the bend  
My huckleberry friend, Moon River and me  
(Moon River off to see the world)  
(There's such a lot of world to see)  
We're after the same rainbows end  
Waiting round the bend  
My huckleberry friend, Moon River and me  

Saying I love you  
Is not the words  
I want to hear from you  
It's not that I want you  
Not to say  
But if you only knew  
How easy  
It would be to  
Show me how you feel  
More than words  
Is all you have to do  
To make it real  
Then you wouldn't  
Have to say  
That you love me  
Cos I'd already know  
  
What would you do  
If my heart was torn in two  
More than words to show you feel  
That your love for me is real  
What would you say  
If I took those words away  
Then you couldn't make things new  
Just by saying I love you  
  
Its more than words,  
Its more than what you say  
Its the things you do  
Oh yeah  
Its more than words,  
Its more than what you say  
Its the things you do  
Oh yeah  
  
Now that I've tried to  
Talk to you  
And make you understand  
All you have to do  
Is close your eyes  
And just reach out your hands  
  
And touch me  
Hold me close  
Don't ever let me go  
More than words  
Is all I ever  
Needed you to show  
Then you wouldn't have to say  
That you love me  
Cos I'd already know  
  
What would you do  
If my heart was torn in two  
More than words to show you feel  
That your love for me is real  
What would you say if I took those words away  
Then you couldn't make things new  
Just by saying I love you

I've got sunshine on a cloudy day  
When it's cold outside I've got the month of May  
I guess you'd say  
What can make me feel this way?  
My girl (my girl, my girl)  
Talkin' 'bout my girl (my girl)  
  
I've got so much honey the bees envy me  
I've got a sweeter song than the birds in the trees  
I guess you'd say  
What can make me feel this way?  
My girl (my girl, my girl)  
Talkin' 'bout my girl (my girl)  
  
Hey hey hey  
Hey hey hey  
Ooh  
  
I don't need no money, fortune, or fame  
I've got all the riches baby one man can claim  
I guess you'd say  
What can make me feel this way?  
My girl (my girl, my girl)  
Talkin' 'bout my girl (my girl)  
  
I've got sunshine on a cloudy day  
With my girl  
  
I've even got the month of May  
With my girl

An empty street  
An empty house  
A hole inside my heart  
I'm all alone  
The rooms are getting smaller  
I wonder how  
I wonder why  
I wonder where they are  
The days we had  
The songs we sang together  
Oh yeah  
And all my love  
We're holding on forever  
Reaching for the love that seems so far  
  
So I say a little prayer  
Hope my dreams will take me there  
Where the skies are blue  
To see you once again my love  
Over seas from coast to coast  
Find the place I love the most  
Where the fields are green  
To see you once again, my love  
  
I tried to read  
I go to work  
I'm laughing with my friends  
But I can't stop  
To keep myself from thinking  
  
Oh no  
I wonder how  
I wonder why  
I wonder where they are  
The days we had  
The songs we sang together  
Oh yeah  
And all my love  
We're holding on forever  
Reaching for the love that seems so far  
  
So I say a little prayer  
Hope my dreams will take me there  
Where the skies are blue  
To see you once again, my love  
Over seas from coast to coast  
Find the place I love the most  
Where the fields are green  
To see you once again  
  
To hold you in my arms  
To promise you my love  
To tell you from my heart  
You're all I'm thinking of  
And reaching for the love that seems so far  
  
So so I say a little prayer  
Hope my dreams will take me there  
Where the skies are blue  
To see you once again, my love  
Over seas from coast to coast  
Find the place I love the most  
Where the fields are green  
To see you once again, my love  
See you in a prayer  
Dreams will take me there  
Where the skies are blue  
To see you once again  
Over seas from coast to coast  
Find the place I love the most  
Where the fields are green  
To see you once again, my love

Mark:  
I'm feeling so alone now tonight  
Even though you're here by my side  
Is there something on your mind  
From the world you'd left behind  
  
I feel as if the loved shared before  
Doesn't want to be here no more  
And if there's something on your mind  
There's never been a better time  
To tell me  
  
Bryan:  
Do you love me  
Still wanting me  
Like I need you, oh  
  
All:  
There came a crossing on the road  
If only there were signs to show me  
Which direction I should go  
I live my life with no regrets  
It hasn't caught up on me yet  
But I never knew I was losing you  
  
Nicky:  
I wonder as you walk through the door  
Are you gonna hurt me some more  
Never took you for the kind  
Who would play up on my mind  
  
Bryan:  
Tell me what are you looking for  
I can't play your games anymore  
And when there's something on my mind  
I will always find the time  
To tell you  
  
I still love you  
Still wanting you  
How I need you, oh  
  
All:  
There came a crossing on the road  
If only there were signs to show me  
Which direction I should go  
I live my life with no regrets  
It hasn't caught up on me yet  
Well I never knew I was losing you  
Losing you  
  
Bryan:  
It's not for the first time  
That someone else has hurt me  
By faking it too long  
Where did we go wrong, yeah  
  
All:  
There came a crossing on the road  
If only there were signs to show me  
Which direction I should go  
I live my life with no regrets  
It hasn't caught up on me yet  
Well I never knew I was losing you  
  
There came a crossing on the road  
If only there were signs to show me  
Which direction I should go  
I live my life with no regrets  
It hasn't caught up on me yet  
Well I never knew I was losing you  
Losing you

When the waves are crashing down  
Pulling you to sorrow  
I will sail you back to shore  
When there are no more heroes  
Over under, near or far  
I'll be right beside you  
Standing here with open arms  
When there are no more heroes  
  
And through it all  
And through it all  
When you're tired and you stumble I will carry you  
When starlight falls, my love will guide you home  
You'll never be alone  
When there are no more heroes  
  
It was you who showed me how  
Brought me back to glory  
Through hopelessness and darkest days  
It was breath you gave me  
  
And through it all  
And through it all  
When you're tired and you stumble I will carry you  
When starlight falls, my love will guide you home  
You'll never be alone  
When there are no more heroes  
  
And through it all  
And through it all  
When you're tired and you stumble I will carry you  
When starlight falls, my love will guide you home  
You'll never be alone  
When there are no more heroes  
  
And through it all  
And through it all  
When you're tired and you stumble I will carry you  
When starlight falls, my love will guide you home  
You'll never be alone  
When there are no more heroes  
  
When there are no more heroes

Here I stand.  
Looking in your eyes, I'm an open book.  
Shatter heart is all I have to give,  
And that's what you took.  
Feels so good, that I can't say goodbye.  
Watching time, fly by.  
Will it stop if I close my eyes?  
  
If I could, make a moment last forever.  
This would be the one I choose.  
You and me here together.  
Feels so right, feels so true.  
Every star, let to you, shine so bright.  
No one's gonna sleep tonight.  
No, no one's gonna sleep tonight.  
  
From the start,  
I knew that we'd be here dancing in the dark.  
Feel the spark,  
You can sign your name right across my heart.  
It's so good,  
I just want you to stay.  
Tell me why, we feel,  
It's never gonna go away.  
  
If I could, make a moment last forever.  
This would be the one I choose.  
You and me here together.  
Feels so right, feels so true.  
Every star, let to you, shine so bright.  
No one's gonna sleep tonight.  
No, no one's gonna sleep tonight.  
  
All my life I've waited.  
Afraid to surrender.  
Always gone whatever.  
Now I'm wondering  
  
If I could, make a moment last forever.  
This would be the one I choose.  
You and me here together.  
Feels so right, feels so true.  
Every star, let to you, shine so bright.  
No one's gonna sleep tonight.  
No, no one's gonna sleep tonight.  
  
Tonight (Can you hear me)  
Tonight (Can you hear me)  
No one's gonna sleep tonight  
(Can you hear me)  
No one's gonna sleep tonight

I can't imagine any greater fear  
Than waking up without you here  
And though the sun would still shine on  
My whole world would all be gone  
But not for long  
  
If I had to run  
If I had to crawl  
If I had to swim a hundred rivers  
Just to climb a thousand walls  
Always know that I would find a way  
To get to where you are  
There's no place that far  
  
It wouldn't matter why we're apart  
Lonely months, two stubborn hearts  
Nothing short of God above  
Could turn me away from your love  
I need you that much  
  
If I had to run  
If I had to crawl  
If I had to swim a hundred rivers  
Just to climb a thousand walls  
Always know that I would find a way  
To get to where you are  
There's no place that far

Isn't life strange  
A total mystery  
As we passed each day  
Did you notice me?  
  
And I know girl  
You've been looking at me  
And I know now  
That you and me were meant to be  
What would it take to realize  
That in my heart  
No matter what they say  
  
[Chorus]  
No matter what they say  
When it comes to love  
Two hearts are inseparable  
No matter what they say  
When it comes to love  
Nothing is impossible  
  
Walking down that road  
It's coming back to me  
Did you feel it inside  
A thousand memories  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When it comes to you and me  
There's so much more  
Than they can see  
And that's how it's meant to be  
  
[Chorus]

Shane: we started as friends  
But something happened inside me  
Now I'm reading into everything  
But there's no sign you hear the lightning, baby  
  
You don't ever notice me  
Turning on my charm  
Or wonder why I'm always where you are  
  
I've made it obvious  
I've done everything but say it  
(i've crushed on ya so long, but on and on you get me wrong)  
I'm not so good with words  
Since you never noticed  
The way that we belong  
I'll say it in a love song  
  
I've heard you talk about  
(heard you talk about)  
How you want someone just like me  
But every time I ask you out  
(time I ask you out)  
We never move past friendly no,no  
  
And you never how  
I stare when we're alone  
Or wonder why I keep you on the phone  
  
I've made it obvious  
Done everything but sing it  
(I've crushed on you so long but on and on you get me wrong)  
I'm not so good with words  
And since you never notice  
The way that we belong  
I'll say it in a love song  
Yeah  
  
You are my very first thought in the morning  
  
And my last at nightfall  
  
You are my love that came without warning  
  
Mark and Shane:  
I need you  
I want you to know  
  
I've made it obvious  
So finally I'll sing it  
(I've crushed on you so long)  
I'm not so good with words  
And since you never notice  
The way that we belong  
I'll say it in a love song  
  
And sing it until the day you're holding me  
I've wanted you so long but on and on you get me wrong  
I more then adore you but since you never seem to see  
  
But you never seem to see  
I'll say it in this love song

SHANE  
Nah nahnah nah nahh  
All around the world (2)  
Someone needs somebody  
Let it be a shield  
All around the world (2)  
Someones feeling lonely  
But I know you never will  
  
ALL  
'cause when it all gets too much  
Put your head down on my shoulder  
A little warmth when it gets colder  
Now I don't know the things that your going through  
But you can put your head down  
On my shoulder  
Where the storm is it blows ova  
I know your there for me too  
No Ill be there for you  
  
BRYAN  
Your waiting for a change  
Your waiting for the day  
When all that you remember is with you once again  
there's a long road ahead  
It stretches out for miles  
And if you want some company  
Walk with me a while  
Ohh and when the road gets too rough  
  
ALL  
Put your head down on my shoulder  
A little warmth when it gets colder  
Now I don't know the things that your going through  
But you can put your head down  
On my shoulder  
Where the storm is it blows ova  
I know your there for me too  
No Ill be there for you  
  
SHANE  
When it all..gets too..much...  
  
Chorus

It's the way she fills my senses  
It's the perfume that she wears  
I feel I'm losing my defenses  
To the color of your hair  
  
And every little piece of her is right  
Just thinking about her takes me through the night  
  
[Chorus]  
Every time we meet the picture is complete  
Every time we touch the feeling is too much  
She's all I ever need to fall in love again  
I knew it from the very start  
She's the puzzle of my heart  
  
It's the way she's always smiling  
That makes people think she never cries  
Feel like I'm losing my defenses  
To the color of her eyes  
  
And every little piece of her is right  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Like a miracle should meant to be  
She became the light inside of me  
Like a feeling like a memory from long ago  
  
[Chorus]

I lie alone and thinking,  
How could this ever happen?  
Is it real am I dreaming?  
And when your hearts been burnt,  
How can someone learn to get over their fears?  
You told me I should be strong,  
I'm trying I feel I can't go on,  
You left me here on my own,  
  
Without a reason for living,  
A chance for forgiving,  
A time to make it ok.  
And now I'm stuck with the vision  
Of my indecision,  
Taking it all away,  
From me  
  
With all the time your taking,  
Slowly my hearts been breakin',  
You've been fine I've been bleeding,  
Ill have to wait my turn,  
Your respect ill earn,  
No more joking or teasing.  
  
You told me I should be strong,  
I'm trying I feel I can't go on,  
You left me here on my own,  
Without a reason 4 living,  
A chance for forgiving,  
A time to make it okay.  
And now I'm stuck with the vision  
Of my indecision,  
Taking it all away,  
From me  
  
A thousand times before,  
I've been almost sure,  
This time i need to know,  
I've spent all my life,  
Chasing all my dreams,  
I'm not letting this go.  
  
Without a reason for living,  
A chance for forgiving,  
A time to make it okay.  
And now I'm stuck with the vision  
Of my indecision,  
Taking it all away,  
From me

Hard to find a way to get through  
It's a tragedy  
Pulling at me like the stars do  
You're like gravity  
Even if the wind blows  
It makes it hard to believe  
  
How ya gonna love  
How ya gonna feel  
How you gonna live your life like the dream you have is real  
And If you lost your way  
I will keep you safe  
We'll open up all the world inside  
I see it come alive tonight  
I will keep you safe  
  
Doesn't even matter to you  
To see what I can see  
I'm crawling on the floor to reach you  
I'm a wreck you see  
When you're far from home now  
Makes it hard to believe  
  
So how ya gonna love  
How ya gonna feel  
How you gonna live your life like the dream you have is real  
  
If you've lost your way  
I will keep you safe  
Well open up all your world inside  
Til you come alive tonight  
I will keep you safe  
  
We all fall down  
We all feel down  
'Cause rainy days and summer highs  
The more we pray the more we feel alive  
  
How ya gonna love  
How ya gonna feel  
How you gonna live your life like the dream you have is real  
How ya gonna love  
How ya gonna feel  
How you gonna live your life like the dream you have is real  
  
If you've lost your way  
I will keep you safe  
Well open up all your world inside  
So you come alive tonight  
I will keep you safe  
  
Well I will keep you safe  
I will keep you safe

Goodbye to you my trusted friend  
We've known each other since we were nine or ten  
Together we've climbed hills and trees  
Learned of love and ABC's  
Skinned our hearts and skinned our knees  
Goodbye my friend it's hard to die  
When all the birds are singing in the sky  
Now that spring is in the air  
Pretty girls are everywhere  
Think of me and I'll be there  
  
We had joy, we had fun  
we had seasons in the sun  
But the hills that we climbed  
Were just seasons out of time  
  
Goodbye Papa please pray for me  
I was the black sheep of the family  
You tried to teach me right from wrong  
Too much wine and too much song  
Wonder how I got along  
Goodbye Papa it's hard to die  
When all the birds are singing in the sky  
Now that the spring is in the air  
Little children everywhere  
When you see them, I'll be there  
  
We had joy, we had fun  
We had seasons in the sun  
But the wine and the song  
Like the seasons have all gone  
We had joy, we had fun  
We had seasons in the sun  
But the wine and the song  
Like the seasons have all gone  
  
Goodbye Michelle my little one  
You gave me love and helped me find the sun  
And every time that I was down  
You would always come around  
And get my feet back on the ground  
Goodbye Michelle it's hard to die  
When all the birds are singing in the sky  
Now that the spring is in the air  
With the flowers everywhere  
I wish that we could both be there

Morning after  
Still lingers  
Just waking up  
I see a shadow of you  
Making breakfast for two  
I go driving  
Past our place and  
I see this girl walk by  
I smell her perfume  
For a moment I wish it was you  
  
I'm not gonna tell ya  
I'm not gonna say that I'm okay, no  
I'm tryin' to get over  
I'm tryin' to get far away from our mistakes  
  
But I see shadows  
Everywhere that I go  
It's you, reminding me  
Of how we were  
Of how it was  
I see shadows  
Everywhere they follow  
It's you and memories  
Of how we loved  
I've had enough of your shadows  
  
Four months gone  
I can't feel you  
I don't understand it  
Where did you go?  
I hate that you're all that I know  
  
I'm not gonna tell ya  
I'm not gonna say that I'm okay, no  
I'm tryin' to get over  
I'm tryin' to get far away from our mistakes  
  
But I see shadows  
Everywhere that I go  
It's you, reminding me  
Of how we were  
Of how it was  
I see shadows  
Everywhere they follow  
It's you and memories  
Of how we loved  
I've had enough of your shadows  
  
You couldn't love me  
So why won't you leave me?  
Shadows  
Alone is the only place I want to be  
  
I see shadows  
Everywhere that I go  
It's you, reminding me  
Of how to love  
I've had enough  
I see shadows  
Everywhere they follow  
It's you, the memories  
Of how we loved  
I've had enough

I'm only human  
Sometimes I make mistakes  
If you forgive me  
I'm gonna do what it takes  
  
But now I know better  
To hurt you was wrong  
Girl it's with you I belong  
  
Somebody needs you  
Like never before  
Somebody wants your love  
So open the door  
Don't you leave me alone  
Don't you turn out the light  
Somebody wants you  
Somebody needs you tonight  
  
I've been thinking  
We should be talking it through  
You must believe me  
I'll make it up to you  
  
Cause now I know better  
To hurt you was wrong  
Girl it's with you I belong  
  
In the dark  
When there's no one else around  
I still pray  
That our love can be found

Never thought that I'd so inspired  
Never thought that I'd find the higher truth  
I believed that love was overrated  
'Till the moment I found you  
  
Now baby I know I don't deserve  
The love you give me  
But now I understand that  
  
[Chorus]  
If you want me I must be doing something right  
I got nothing left to prove  
And it's all because of you  
So if you need me  
And baby I make you feel alive  
I know I must be doing  
Doing something right  
  
It's because of you I feel so lifted  
I've been looking at my life from higher ground  
Never thought I'd be so elated  
You're the one that turned it all around  
  
Now baby, I didn't know myself  
Until you changed me  
And made me understand that  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And baby I know I don't deserve the love you give me  
But I don't really care, cause  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Doing something right  
Yeah yeah  
Something right  
  
So if you need me  
And baby I make you feel alive  
I know I must be doing (I know I must be doing)  
Must be doing something right  
Yeah yeah  
Something right

After all the lights come down  
And the circus has left town  
Will you be the one I can count on  
Will you be around  
  
When the stage is dark and empty  
And the last song has been sung  
Will the love you feel still be as strong  
To help me carry on  
  
Let me know the words inside you, say I do  
  
Tell me it's love it's all I want to hear you say  
That we're in love, that you're always gonna feel this way  
No matter what, no matter when  
You know I'd do it all again  
Tell me it's love  
Say I'm the one  
  
When it's easier to walk away  
Are you strong enough to turn the page  
Do you know how to begin again  
Would you let me in  
  
I'd get through anything I had to if I've got you  
  
Tell me it's love it's all I want to hear you say  
That we're in love, that you're always gonna feel this way  
No matter what, no matter when  
You know I'd do it all again  
Tell me it's love  
Say I'm the one  
  
'Cause you know I want nothing else  
Then to have you to myself  
Your love is all I ever knew  
If you feel it let me know the words inside you  
Say I do  
  
Tell me it's love that's all I want to hear you say  
That we're in love, that you're always gonna feel this way  
No matter what, no matter when  
You know I'd do it all again  
Tell me it's love  
Say I'm the one that's all I want to hear you say  
That we're in love, that you're always gonna feel this way  
No matter what, no matter when  
You know I'd do it all again  
Tell me it's love  
Say I'm the one

Now I'm levitating  
Cause I feel like I've been waiting  
For a lifetime  
For your touch  
  
Now I'm six feet off the ground  
And I may never come back down, yeah  
Cause I still feel your kiss  
It's on my lips  
And I keep wishing  
You come back around, oh  
  
When you came along  
(When you came along)  
You know you save me from  
(You know you save me from)  
Ordinary day  
(Yeah!)  
  
You left me with your touch  
So thank you very much!  
  
Oh yeah!  
Thank you very much!  
  
I want to thank you for this smile  
Although I don't say this much  
It's usually not my style  
I was sleeping and yesterday  
You gave my world a shakin'  
My eyes are open wide, oh  
  
Can't believe it's true  
(I can't believe it's true)  
I've been kissing you  
(Cos I've been kissing you)  
Now everything I do  
(Everything I'm)  
I'm sucker to your touch  
So thank you very much!  
  
I want to say  
  
Thank you very much!  
  
Good God  
There I was  
Then you came  
(Imagine my surprise!)  
Some say  
Less is more  
But I'm not sure  
(Cos I can't say goodbye)  
Some day  
I may fall  
But till that day  
I'll be feeling high  
So high  
Yeah, yeah  
Thank you very much!  
I want to thank you  
For the love that you gave me  
Cause it's all in your touch  
  
Can't believe it's true  
(I don't believe it's true)  
I've been kissing you  
(Cos I've been kissing you)  
Now everything I do  
(Well everything I'm)  
I'm sucker to your touch  
So thank you very much  
  
One more time!  
Thank you very much!  
I got a feeling, girl  
You can be my world  
We were meant to be together  
Can't you see it got me, oh yeah!  
  
Good God  
There I was  
Then you came  
Imagine my surprise!  
Some say  
Less is more  
But I'm not sure  
Cause I can't say goodbye  
  
Good God  
There I was  
Then you came  
Imagine my surprise!  
Some say  
Less is more  
But I'm not sure  
Cause I can't say goodbye  
  
Good God  
There I was  
Then you came  
Imagine my surprise!  
Some say  
Less is more  
But I'm not sure  
Cause I can't say goodbye

I'm not a perfect person  
There's many things I wish I didn't do  
But I continue learning  
I never meant to do those things to you  
And so I have to say before I go  
That I just want you to know  
  
I've found a reason for me  
To change who I used to be  
A reason to start over new  
And the reason is you  
  
I'm sorry that I hurt you  
It's something I must live with every day  
And all the pain I put you through  
I wish that I could take it all away  
And be the one who catches all your tears  
That's why I need you to hear  
  
I've found a reason for me  
To change who I used to be  
A reason to start over new  
And the reason is you  
  
And the reason is you  
And the reason is you  
And the reason is you  
  
I'm not a perfect person  
I never meant to do those things to you  
And so I have to say before I go  
That I just want you to know  
  
I've found a reason for me  
To change who I used to be  
A reason to start over new  
And the reason is you  
  
I've found a reason to show  
A side of me you didn't know  
A reason for all that I do  
And the reason is you

Some say love it is a river  
That drowns the tender reed  
Some say love it is a razor  
That leaves your soul to bleed  
  
Some say love it is a hunger  
An endless aching need  
I say love it is a flower  
And you it's only seed  
  
It's the heart afraid of breaking  
That never learns to dance  
It's the dream afraid of waking that never takes the chance  
It's the one who won't be taken  
Who cannot seem to give  
And the soul afraid of dying that never learns to live  
  
When the night has been too lonely  
And the road has been too long  
And you think that love is only  
For the lucky and the strong  
Just remember in the winter far beneath the bitter snows  
Lies the seed  
That with the sun's love  
In the spring  
Becomes the rose

The song of a little bird  
The joy in three little words  
I know it's real  
That's how it feels  
To be loved by you  
The stars from a midnight sky  
The melody from a lullaby  
There's nothing real  
That I wouldn't steal  
To be loved by you  
  
[Chorus]  
To be loved by you  
If everybody knows  
It's only 'cause it shows  
  
A smile to put you on a high  
A kiss that sets your soul alight  
Would it be all right if I spent tonight  
Being loved by you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Your love is released  
And you move me with ease  
And you rescue me time after time  
Oh oh you give your all  
And you take it all in your stride  
  
Oh with all the power of a symphony  
That's how my heart beats when you're holding me  
I can't conceal, this is how it feels  
To be loved by you  
Oh yeah, to be loved by you  
If everybody knows, it's only 'cause it shows  
Because I take your love, Everywhere I go  
  
I know what it is I need, it's clear as a shallow stream  
It's as it seems, my only dreams  
To be loved by you

Hold on, little girl  
Show me what he's done to you  
Stand up, little girl  
A broken heart can't be that bad  
When it's through, it's through  
Fate will twist the both of you  
So come on, baby, come on over  
Let me be the one to show you  
  
I'm the one who wants to be with you  
Deep inside I hope you'll feel it too  
Waited on a line of greens and blues  
Just to be the next to be with you  
  
Build up your confidence  
So you can be on top for once  
Wake up. Who cares about little boys  
That talk too much?  
I've seen it all go down  
The game of love was all rained out  
Let me be the one to hold you  
  
I'm the one who wants to be with you  
Deep inside I hope you'll feel it too  
Waited on a line of greens and blues  
Just to be the next to be with you  
  
Why be alone when we can be together, baby?  
You can make my life worth while  
I can make you start to smile  
When it's through, it's through  
And fate will twist the both of you  
Let me be the one to show you  
  
I'm the one who wants to be with you  
Deep inside I hope you'll feel it too  
Waited on a line of greens and blues  
Just to be the next to be with you  
I'm the one who wants to be with you  
Let me be the one to show you  
  
I'm the one who wants to be with you  
Deep inside I hope you'll feel it too  
Waited on a line of greens and blues  
Just to be the next to be with you  
I'm the one who wants to be with you  
Let me be the one to show you  

Every time I close my eyes  
You're all that I can see  
I hold you in my heart  
And know you're watching over me  
  
Standing by your side  
It felt like I could fly  
If I could be half the man that you are in my eyes  
And I could face the darkest day  
And fight the tears inside  
I can't turn the page or hold back the time  
It's too hard to say goodbye  
It's too hard to say goodbye  
  
From you I learnt it all  
You would never let me fall  
Love won't come undone  
Between a father and his son  
  
Standing by your side  
Felt like I could fly  
If I could be half the man that you are in my eyes  
I would face the darkest day  
And fight the tears inside  
I can't turn the page or hold back the time  
It's too hard to say goodbye  
It's too hard to say goodbye  
  
There will come a day  
I'll have to walk alone  
And I'll have to make it on my own  
  
You taught me all there is to know  
Dad I'll never let you go  
  
Standing by your side  
I felt like I could fly  
If I could be half the man that you are in my eyes  
I would face the darkest day  
Fight back the tears inside  
But I can't turn this page or hold back the time  
  
It's too hard to say goodbye  
It's too hard to say goodbye  
Just can't say goodbye

Turnaround, every now and then I get a little bit  
Lonely and you're never coming round  
Turnaround, every now and then I getta little bit  
Tired of listening to the sound of my tears  
Turnaround, every now and then I get a little bit  
Nervous that the best of all the years have gone by  
Turnaround, every now and then I get a little bit  
Terrified and then I see the look in your eyes  
Turnaround bright eyes, every now and then I fall apart  
Turnaround bright eyes, every now and then I fall apart  
  
And I need you now tonight  
And I need you more than ever  
And if you'll only hold me tight  
We'll be holding on forever  
And we'll only be making it right  
Cause we'll never be wrong together  
We can take it to the end of the line  
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time (all of the time)  
I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark  
We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks  
I really need you tonight  
Forever's gonna start tonight  
Forever's gonna start tonight  
  
Once upon a time I was falling in love  
But now I'm only falling apart  
There's nothing I can do  
A total eclipse of the heart  
Once upon a time there was light in my life  
But now there's only love in the dark  
Nothing I can do  
A total eclipse of the heart  
  
Turnaround, every now and then I get a little bit  
Restless and I dream of something wild  
Turnaround, every now and then I get a little bit  
Helpless and I'm lying like a child in your arms  
Turnaround, every now and then I get a little bit  
Angry and I know I've got to get out and cry  
Turnaround, every now and then I get a little bit  
Terrified but then I see the look in you eyes  
Turnaround bright eyes, every now and then I fall apart  
Turnaround bright eyes, every now and then I fall apart  
  
And I need you now tonight  
And I need you more than ever  
And if you'll only hold me tight  
We'll be holding on forever  
And we'll only be making it right  
Cause we'll never be wrong together  
We can take it to the end of the line  
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time (all of the time)  
I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark  
We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks  
I really need you tonight  
Forever's gonna start tonight  
Forever's gonna start tonight  
  
Once upon a time I was falling in love  
But now I'm only falling apart  
There's nothing I can do  
A total eclipse of the heart  
  
A total eclipse of the heart  
A total eclipse of the heart  
A total eclipse of the heart  
A total eclipse of the heart

Some people are lucky baby  
I guess I am too  
Love found me  
And I found you  
And every time I think it can't get better  
You do something new  
And I'm renewed  
  
And when it gets cold  
And I think it's over  
Look what you go and do  
  
Every time I turn around  
Give me a reason  
For feeling the way that I do  
Every time I turn around  
Give me a reason  
To put my faith in you  
Even when you let me down  
I forgive you  
'cause I know that you're feeling it too  
Anytime I turn around  
Make me believe it  
The things that I already knew  
  
Mark: you lock me up in kisses baby  
Here to toe  
Let the whole world stare  
I don't care  
You make me breakfast in bed  
Just to show me  
No-one wants me no more  
I'm secure  
  
And when it gets cold and  
I think its over  
Look what you go and do  
  
Every time I turn around  
Give me a reason  
For feeling the way that I do  
Every time I turn around  
Give me a reason  
To put my faith in you  
Even when you let me down  
I forgive you  
'cause I know that you're feeling it too  
Anytime I turn around  
Make me believe it  
The things that I already knew  
  
Turn around, turn around, turn around, turn around, turn around, turn around  
  
Cause you know  
That I know  
That it's hard to let go  
So why not hold on  
Hold on to us  
'cause you know  
That I know  
That it's hard to let go  
So why not hold on  
  
Every time I turn around  
Give me a reason  
For feeling the way that I do  
Every time I turn around  
Give me a reason  
To put my faith in you  
Even when you let me down  
I forgive you  
'cause I know that you're feeling it too  
Anytime I turn around  
Make me believe it  
The things that I already knew  
  
Every time I turn around  
Bryan:and when it gets cold and  
I think it's over  
Look what you go and do  
  
Every time I turn around  
Shane:and when it gets cold and  
I think it's over  
Look what you go and do  
  
Even when you let me down  
And when it gets cold and  
I think it's over  
Look what you go and do  
  
Anytime I turn around  
  
And when it gets cold and  
I think it's over  
Look what you go and do  
Every time I turn around  
  
And when it gets cold and  
I think it's over  
Look what you go and do

Took my hand  
Touched my heart  
Held me close  
You were always there  
  
By my side  
Night and day  
Through it all  
Maybe come what may  
  
Swept away on a wave of emotion  
Over-caught in the eye of the storm  
And whenever you smile  
I can hardly believe that you're mine  
Believe that you're mine  
  
This love is  
It's unmistakable  
And each time I look in your eyes  
I know why  
This love is untouchable  
I feel that my heart just can't deny  
Each time I look in your eyes  
Oh baby, I know why  
This love is unbreakable  
  
Shared the laughter  
Shared the tears  
We both know  
We'll go on from here  
  
'Cause together we are strong  
In my arms  
That's where you belong  
  
I've been touched by the hands of an angel  
I've been blessed by the power of love  
And whenever you smile  
I can hardly believe that you're mine  
  
This love is unbreakable  
It's unmistakable  
Each time I look in your eyes  
I know why  
This love is untouchable  
I feel that my heart just can't deny  
Each time you whisper my name  
Oh baby, I know why  
  
This love is unbreakable  
Through fire and flame  
When all this over  
Our love still remains  
  
This love is unbreakable  
It's unmistakable  
And each time I look in your eyes  
I know why  
This love is untouchable  
I feel that my heart just can't deny  
Each time you whisper my name  
Oh baby, I know why  
Cause each time I look in your eyes  
Oh baby, I know why  
  
This love is unbreakable

  
  
  
  
Until the end of time  
  
I'm longing for you  
  
And if you feel the same  
  
Then show me your love  
  
I'll give you everything that money can't buy  
  
And I'll promise I'll be right by you side  
  
  
I imagine being wrapped up in your  
  
And feeling your heartbeat  
  
And I find myself longing to hold you close  
  
It's how I feel  
  
'Cause I've been through a lot of these years  
  
And I have lost the count of my tears  
  
  
(CHORUS)  
  
Until the end of time  
  
I'm longing for you  
  
And if you feel the same  
  
Then show me your love  
  
I'll give you everything that money can't buy..(can't buy)  
  
And I'll promise I'll be right by you side..(til the end of time)  
  
  
If only you could tell me what's on your mind  
  
And show how you feel  
  
And I wonder where you are heading this time  
  
And where you belong  
  
'Cause I know that if you would be here  
  
I'll do anything 'cause my love is real  
  
Even though moments are sad  
  
I look into your eyes and  
  
I know this will last  
  
CHORUS x2  
  
Things that money can't buy x3  
  

Uptown girl  
She's been living in her uptown world  
I bet she never had a back street guy  
I bet her mama never told her why  
  
I'm gonna try for an uptown girl  
She's been living in her white bread world  
As long as anyone with hot blood can  
And now she's looking for a downtown man  
That's what I am  
  
And when she knows what  
She wants from her time  
And when she wakes up  
And makes up her mind  
  
She'll see I'm not so tough  
Just because  
I'm in love with an uptown girl  
You know I've seen her in her uptown world  
She's getting tired of her high class toys  
And all her presents from her uptown boys  
She's got a choice  
  
Uptown girl  
You know I can't afford to buy her pearls  
But maybe someday when my ship comes in  
She'll understand what kind of guy I've been  
And then I'll win  
  
And when she's walking  
She's looking so fine  
And when she's talking  
She'll say that she's mine  
  
She'll say I'm not so tough  
Just because  
I'm in love  
With and uptown girl  
She's been living in her white bread world  
As long as anyone with hot blood can  
And now she's looking for a downtown man  
That's what I am  
  
Uptown girl  
She's my uptown girl  
You know I'm in love  
With an uptown girl  
  
My uptown girl  
You know I'm in love  
With an uptown girl  
She my uptown girl  
You know I'm in love  
With an uptown girl  
My uptown girl

Shadows fill an empty heart  
As love is fading,  
From all the things that we are  
But are not saying  
Can we see beyond the stars.  
And make it to the dawn?  
  
Change the colors of the sky  
And open up to  
The ways you made me feel alive,  
The ways I loved you  
For all the things that never died,  
To make it through the night,  
Love will find you  
  
What about now?  
What about today?  
What if you're making me all that I was meant to be?  
What if our love never went away?  
  
What if it's lost behind words we could never find?  
Baby, before it's too late,  
What about now?  
  
The sun is breaking in your eyes  
To start a new day  
This broken heart can still survive  
With a touch of your grace  
Shadows fade into the light  
I am by your side,  
Where love will find you  
  
What about now?  
What about today?  
What if you're making me all that I was meant to be?  
What if our love had never went away?  
What if it's lost behind words we could never find?  
Baby, before it's too late,  
What about now?  
  
Now that we're here,  
Now that we've come this far,  
Just hold on  
There is nothing to fear,  
For I am right beside you.  
For all my life,  
I am yours.  
  
What about now?  
What about today?  
What if you're making me all that I was meant to be?  
What if our love had never went away?  
What if it's lost behind words we could never find?  
  
What about now?  
What about today?  
What if you're making me all that I was meant to be?  
What if our love had never went away?  
What if it's lost behind words we could never find?  
Baby, before it's too late,  
Baby, before it's too late,  
Baby, before it's too late,  
What about now?

When the stars are in her eyes  
And the sun is in her smile  
The only moment in a life  
That happens the same time  
Is when a woman loves a man  
  
She'll be a mother and a child  
Sacrifice her days and nights  
And no other will exists  
She'll put life in every kiss  
When a woman loves a man  
  
And you'll be amazed how when  
You're stumbling  
She'll fight for you  
And won't let you give in  
She'll do all that she can  
When a woman loves a man  
  
A soothing breeze always blows  
Somebody understands another soul  
It's like the planets have aligned  
Every sentence has a rhyme  
When a woman loves a man  
  
Oh, you'll be amazed how when  
You're needing it  
She'll fight for you  
From the beginning to the end  
And she'll do all that she can  
When a woman loves a man  
  
It's the greatest gift of all  
Knowing that unconditionally  
She'll catch you when you fall  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Oh, yeah  
When a woman loves a man  
  
When the stars are in her eyes  
And the sun is in her smile  
She'll be a mother and a child  
But all at the same time  
When a woman loves a man  
  
She'll be your air,  
She'll bring you life  
She'll make me sacrifice  
When a woman loves a man
