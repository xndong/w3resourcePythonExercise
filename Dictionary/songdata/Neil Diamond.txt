If you've been feeling blue  
Hey, it's been the same for me  
Now I'm here with you  
You're exactly what I need  
  
Put your defenses down  
Let me show you now  
This heart to heart is meant to be  
  
Everything about you feels so right  
I only want to have you in my life  
All I really had to sing was somebody there for me  
And if we stay right here all night  
  
Don't you know it's a matter of love  
Don't you know it's a matter of trust  
A connection between you and me  
Can't you see it's a matter of trust, matter of us, matter of love  
  
We've got magic here, it's the power of love I know  
It's dancing in the air, I can feel the feeling grow  
  
Put your defenses down  
Let me hold you now  
And I won't ever let you go  
  
Everything about you feels so right  
I only want to have you in my life  
All I really had to sing was somebody there for me  
And if we stay right here all night  
  
Don't you know it's a matter of love  
Don't you know it's a matter of trust  
Nothing's ever gonna separate us  
You and me, it's a matter of trust, matter of us, matter of love  
  
Put your defenses down  
Let me hold you now  
And I won't ever let you go  
  
Say, everything about you feels so right  
I only want to have you in my life  
All I really had to sing was somebody there for me  
And if we stay right here all night  
  
Don't you know it's a matter of love  
Don't you know it's a matter of trust  
A connection between you and me  
Can't you see it's a matter of trust, matter of us, matter of love  
  
(it's a matter of love)

And the night was filled with laughter  
Echoing through painted smiles  
And I knew each morning after  
I never loved, was never touched  
Gave not at all, got back as much  
In the co-o-omfort of  
A modern day version of lo-o-ove  
  
Truly, how I've cursed the sweet taste  
Of lips that ask so-o much of me  
Still I wonder with every embrace  
Could I give, and not break  
Should I care, and forsake  
All the co-o-omfort of  
A modern day version of lo-o-ove  
  
Close my eyes and keep on runnin'  
Realise it isn't gonna work anymor-ore  
For me, yeah-eah  
I'm afraid, well maybe that's somethin'  
Never cared enough to be afraid of anything  
Before, not before ...  
  
Baffled child on streets of sinner  
Sleeping child, a morning call  
Playful spring, look face the winter  
Take thy hand, taste the kiss  
Leave behind, emptiness  
And the co-o-omfort of  
A modern day version of lo-o-ove

Take my hand,  
I'm a stranger in paradise  
All lost in a wonderland  
A stranger in paradise  
If I stand starry-eyed  
That's a danger in paradise  
For mortals who stand beside  
An angel like you  
I saw your face  
And I ascended  
Out of the common place  
Into the rare  
Somewhere in space  
I hang suspended  
Until I know  
There's a chance that you care  
Won't you answer this fervent prayer  
Of a stranger in Paradise  
Don't send me in dark despair  
From all that I hunger for  
But open your angel's arms  
To this stranger in paradise  
And tell him that he need be  
A stranger no more

Ain't no way  
To get you out of me  
Baby, there ain't no way  
In the whole wide world  
  
I'm about to see  
By and by  
You're all I ever need  
Baby, when I forget how good life is  
  
You bring it home to me  
And I say hey  
  
Come on, hey  
Come on, hey  
Come on, hey  
Come on, hey  
Come on, hey  
Come on, hey  
Come on, hey  
Come on, hey  
Come on, hey  
  
Hey Hey  
Ain't no way  
Good time come  
Ain't no doubt on it  
  
Tomorrow sure looks somethin' else  
No matter where I sit  
Good time here  
Big plum without no pit  
  
And baby, there ain't no way to forget  
That you're the why of it  
And I say hey  
  
Come on, hey  
Come on, hey  
Come on, hey  
Come on, hey  
Come on, hey  
Come on, hey  
Come on, hey  
Come on, hey  
Come on, hey  
  
Hey Hey  
Ain't no way  
And I say hey  
  
Come on, hey  
Come on, hey  
Come on, hey  
Come on, hey  
Come on, hey  
Come on, hey  
Come on, hey  
Come on, hey  
Come on, hey  
  
Ain't no way  
Hey Come on, hey  
  
Come on, hey  
Come on, hey  
Come on, hey  
Come on, hey  
Come on, hey  
Come on, hey  
Come on, hey  
Come on, hey  
  
Ain't no way

After all these years  
After all these tears between us  
Still I couldn't find  
Someone half as right as you  
And each time I stop to think  
What it is I really need  
Here's what I conclude  
All I really need is you  
  
Just say what you want to say  
You don't have a chance in the world  
Can I, knowing how I've tried  
Still come close to losing you, girl  
When you are my world  
Have I spent so many years  
Trying but in vain to tell you  
Don't you know it's true  
All I really need is you  
  
How was I to know  
We'd have ended here  
Where we finally did  
You tied your life to mine  
Once upon a starry night  
And when someone asks for me  
What it is that I believe  
Say, I believe it's true  
All I really need is you  
  
Just say what you want to say  
We don't have a chance in the world  
Can I, knowing how I've tried  
Still come close to losing you, girl  
When you are my world  
Have I spent so many years  
Tryin' but in vain to tell you  
Feelings come and go  
Me, I'm never gonna ever let you go  
Promise you I'm gonna always love you so  
Cause all I really need is you

Listen easy, you can hear God calling  
Walking barefoot by the stream  
Come on to me, Your hair's softly falling  
On my face as in a dream  
And the time will be our time  
And the grass won't pay no mind  
  
Saying nothing, lying where the sun is  
Baking down upon our sides  
My lips touch you, with their soft wet kisses  
Your hands gentle in reply  
And the time will be our time  
And the grass won't pay no mind  
  
Child, touch my soul with your cries  
And the music will know what we've found  
I, hear a hundred good-byes  
But today I hear only one sound  
The moment we're living is now  
Now now now now now now now  
  
Young bird flying, and a soft wind blowing  
Cools the sweat inside my palms  
Close my eyes, hear the flowers growing  
As you lay sleeping in my arms  
And the time will be our time  
And the grass won't pay no mind  
No the grass won't pay no mind

Young it was  
True it was  
Days without wond'ring  
Fall with a special thing  
Laugh, I could laugh  
And I did  
And the singer sings his song  
And the children dance along  
And the singer sings his song  
And we dance along  
Good it was  
When it was  
We chased the flowers  
Warm summer showers  
Once, it was once  
Long ago  
And the singer sings his song  
And the children dance along  
And the singer sings his song  
And we dance along  
Once, it was once  
Long ago  
And the singer sings his song  
And the children dance along  
And the singer sings his song  
And we dance along  
And the singer sings his song  
And we dance along

I have always been a wand'rer  
Over land and sea  
Yet a moonbeam on the water  
Casts a spell o'er me  
A vision fair I see  
Again I seem to be  
Back home again in Indiana  
And it seems that I can see  
The gleaming candlelight still shining bright  
Thro' the sycamores for me  
The new mown hay sends all its fragrance  
From fields I used to roam  
When I dream  
About the moonlight on the Wabash  
Then I long for my Indiana home  
Fancy paints on mem'ry's canvas  
Scenes that we hold dear  
We recall them in days after  
Clearly they appear  
And often times I see  
A scene that's dear to me  
Back home again in Indiana  
And it seems that I can see  
The gleaming candlelight still shining bright  
Thro' the sycamores for me  
The new mown hay sends all its fragrance  
From fields I used to roam  
When I dream  
About the moonlight on the Wabash  
Then I long for my Indiana home

Hey, a woman made my habit  
Lord I need to have  
Feel just like a lion  
A woman's like a little calf  
And everything I got  
Is everything that I want  
And I ain't got no trouble gettin' it on, babe  
Hey, I ain't got not trouble gettin' it on  
  
A flower's made for pickin'  
One that fits me is better off  
Than the one that fades away  
And everything I got  
Is everything that I want  
And I ain't got no trouble gettin' it on, babe  
Hey, I ain't got no trouble gettin' it on  
  
Mary Jean from New Orleans  
She said she married mainly for love  
But before she could say  
She wasn't that kind of girl  
Uh, she was!  
  
Girl you better look out  
'Cause love is a little like Chinese food  
You're hungry after half an hour  
And everything I got  
Is everything I want  
I ain't got no trouble gettin' it on, baby  
Hey, I ain't got no trouble gettin' it on  
C'mon, hey, hey, hey, hey

What a beautiful noise  
Comin' up from the street  
Got a beautiful sound  
It's got a beautiful beat  
  
It's a beautiful noise  
Goin' on everywhere  
Like the clickety-clack  
Of a train on a track  
It's got a rhythm to spare  
  
It's a beautiful noise  
And it's sound that I love  
And it's fit me as well  
As a hand in a glove  
Yes it does, yes it does  
  
What a beautiful noise  
Comin' up from the park  
It's the song of the kids  
And it plays until dark  
  
It's the song of the cars  
On their furious flights  
But there's even romance  
In the way that they dance  
To beat of the lights  
  
It's a beautiful noise  
And it's a sound that I love  
And it makes me feel good  
Like a hand in a glove  
Yes it does, yes it does  
What a beautiful noise  
  
It's a beautiful noise  
Made of joy an of strife  
Like a symphony played  
By a passing parade  
It's the music of life  
  
What a beautiful noise  
Comin' up to my room  
And it's beggin' for me  
Just to give it a tune

Well, I'm black and blue  
From kickin' myself  
For givin' you up to somebody else  
Just treatin' you human is all I had to do  
  
I got corns walkin' the floor  
My shoes are all worn  
And the carpets half torn  
I'm kickin' myself  
'Til I'm black and blue  
  
Child, I'd be so happy  
If you come back again  
I've been getting slappy  
From all this punishment  
  
Well, I'm runnin' away  
Is it doing me harm  
Go and spend my days on a funny farm  
If I can't spend them being close to you  
'Cause I'm kickin' myself  
It's making me black and blue  
Over you

Everybody says I'm better off without him  
And Bobby never was my kind of boy  
I must have heard a hundred times  
How smart I was to leave that guy  
But I know that  
I was fooling everyone but me  
O-O-Oh  
But how am I supposed to make them see  
That I didn't say goodbye  
Bobby did, Bobby did  
Every time somebody says congratulations  
I just want to find a place for me to hide  
Cause when it's him they're talking of  
That talk's about the boy I love  
Oh yeah,  
To think I'm the one who put him down  
O-O-Oh  
But it was just the other way around  
No, I never said goodbye  
Bobby did, Bobby did  
Cause when it's him they're talking of  
That talk's about the boy I love  
Oh yeah,  
To think I'm the one who put him down  
O-O-Oh  
But it was just the other way around  
No, I never said goodbye  
Bobby did, Bobby did  
Oh, Bobby did  
Bobby did  
Oh, Bobby did

Rolls and flows of angel hair  
Ice cream castles in the air  
Feather canyons everywhere  
I've looked at clouds that way  
But now they only block the sun  
They rain, they snow on everyone  
So many things I would've done  
But clouds got in my way  
  
I've looked at clouds from both sides now  
From up and down and still somehow  
It's clouds' illusions I recall  
I really don't know clouds at all  
  
Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels  
The dizzy, dancing way you feel  
As every fairy tale comes real  
I've looked at love that way  
But now it's just another show  
Leave 'em laughin' when you go  
But if you care, don't let em' know  
Don't give yourself away  
  
I've looked at love from both sides now  
From give and take and still somehow  
It's love's illusions I recall  
I really don't know love at all  
  
Tears and fears and feeling proud  
Say "I love you" right out loud  
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds  
I've looked at life that way  
But now old friends are acting strange  
They shake their heads and say I've changed  
But something's lost when somethings gained  
Living everyday  
  
I've looked at life from both sides now  
From win and lose and still somehow  
It's life's illusions I recall  
I really don't know life at all

Broad old woman  
What goes on behind your mascara'd eyes?  
Broad old woman,  
I know you tried this world  
Once or twice for size  
Tell your story, I'll be listen'  
Past time glories  
Yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah  
  
Broad old woman  
How many men  
Have kicked you down the stairs?  
Broad old woman  
And how many times  
Have you done to same to theirs?  
Sing your bad times  
To this young boy  
I know you have time  
Yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah

If I close my eyes  
I can almost hear my mother  
Callin', "Neil, go find your brother  
Daddy's home, and it's time for supper  
Hurry on"  
  
And I see two boys  
Racin' up two flights of staircase  
Squirmin' into Papa's embrace  
And his whiskers warm on their face  
Where's it gone  
Oh, where's it gone  
  
Two floors above the butcher  
First door on the right  
Life filled to the brim  
As I stood by my window  
And looked out on those  
Brooklyn Roads  
  
I can still recall  
The smell of cookin' in the hallways  
Rubber drying in the doorways  
And report cards I was always  
Afraid to show  
  
Mama'd come to school  
And as I'd sit there softly crying  
Teacher'd say, "He's just not trying  
He's got a good head if he'd apply it"  
But you know yourself  
It's always somewhere else  
  
I built me a castle  
With dragons and kings  
And I'd ride off with them  
As I stood by my window  
And looked out on those  
Brooklyn Roads  
  
Thought of going back  
But all I'd see are strangers' faces  
And all the scars that love erases  
But as my mind walks through those places  
I'm wonderin'  
What's come of them  
  
Does some other young boy  
Come home to my room  
Does he dream what I did  
As he stands by my window  
And looks out on those  
Brooklyn Roads

Silly boy, to think that she loves you  
You're a toy, just part of the game  
You think she needs you  
But she misleads you  
Yes, she's your girl, but only in name  
  
Tenderly, she'll call you her only love  
Can't you see her heart breaking aim?  
She'll call you lover, then kiss another  
Yes, she's your girl, but only in name  
  
She's a girl with no heart at all  
Breaking ev'ry rule  
Still you wait on her beck and call  
While she plays the field,  
You play the fool  
  
Please believe  
These things that I'm telling you  
She deceived my heart just the same  
She was my lover 'til I discovered  
That she was my girl, but only in name

You've gotta take your time now  
If love is gonna take you by the hand  
You need to take your time though  
'Cause love is not a thing you can command  
  
There's gotta be a reason  
Gotta be a closeness  
Gotta have a feeling  
Only you can know  
  
And when you find love hold on tight  
Don't ever waste another night  
You're gonna make it through in spite of your fears  
Can anybody hear me  
Is anybody out there  
  
I listen to the river  
And hear the river calling out a name  
Trying to forgive her  
But nothing's gonna ever be the same  
  
There's gotta be a reason  
Gotta be a closeness  
Gotta have a feeling  
Only you can know  
  
And when you find love hold on tight  
Don't ever waste another night  
You're gonna make it through in spite of your fears  
Can anybody hear me  
Is anybody out there  
  
Gotta be a reason  
Gotta feel a closeness  
Gotta have a feeling  
Only you can know it  
  
And when you find love hold on tight  
Don't ever waste another night  
You're gonna make it through in spite of your fears  
Can anybody hear me  
Is anybody out there  
  
Can anybody hear me  
Is anybody out there  
  
Can anybody out there hear me

How do you capture  
The wind on the water?  
How do you count all the stars in the sky?  
How can you measure  
The love of a mother  
Or how can you write down  
A baby's first cry?  
  
Candlelight, angel light  
Firelight and star glow  
Shine on his cradle till breaking of dawn  
Gloria, Gloria in excelsis Deo!  
Angels are singing  
The Christ child is born  
  
Shepherds and wise men  
Will kneel and adore him  
Seraphim round him their vigil will keep  
Nations proclaim him  
Their Lord and their Saviour  
But Mary will hold him  
And sing him to sleep  
  
Candlelight, angel light  
Firelight and star glow  
Shine on his cradle till breaking of dawn  
Gloria, Gloria in excelsis Deo!  
Angels are singing  
The Christ child is born  
  
Find him at Bethlehem laid in a manger  
Christ our Redeemer asleep in the hay  
Godhead incarnate and hope of salvation  
A child with his mother  
That first Christmas Day  
  
Candlelight, angel light  
Firelight and star glow  
Shine on his cradle till breaking of dawn  
Gloria, Gloria in excelsis Deo!  
Angels are singing  
The Christ child is born  
Angels are singing  
The Christ child is born

I was lost until you found me  
You're the reason for my today  
Was tempest tossed, now I sleep soundly  
Thanks to you I gladly say  
  
That if your goldmine comes up empty  
I'll be there to work the claim  
If you're a captain of a shipwreck  
I'll be first mate to your shame  
  
Trust in me to share your burden  
Stand by you where I belong  
When life brings the day uncertain  
I will soothe you with my song  
  
And if your goldmine comes up empty  
I'll be there to work the claim  
If you're a captain of a shipwreck  
I'll be first mate to your shame  
  
Fear no flood in stormy weather  
Fear no fire if winds arise  
Flesh and blood, I'm yours forever  
And forever, it never dies  
  
And if your goldmine comes up empty  
I'll be there to work the claim  
If you're a captain of a shipwreck  
I'll be first mate to your shame  
  
If you're a captain of a shipwreck  
You can find me up on the top deck  
You'll be captain of a shipwreck  
I'll be first mate to your shame.

Captain Sunshine, make me drink wine,  
Make me feel fine when I'm feelin' wrongly down.  
He don't take much, he don't make much,  
But ah, to be such a man as he,  
  
And walk so pure between the earth and the sea.  
Captain Sunshine, he do me fine,  
Make the words rhyme when he knows the tune is sad.  
He don't take much, he don't make much,  
  
But ah, to be such a man as he,  
And walk so pure between the earth and the sea.  
He don't take much, he don't make much,  
But ah, to be such a man as he,  
And walk so pure between the earth and the sea.

Yo sabia que a ella la perdia  
Vi todoun mundo en  
  
Camelita's eyes  
She took me somewhere,  
Somewhere that's far beyond  
Was going no where  
  
And I couldn't go for long  
The waitin' and prayin'  
Was makin' me tell myself lies  
And all I could see was my  
  
Carmelita's eyes

Carmelita's eyes  
How did I live it before?

Afraid that she'd read me and  
Finally deceive me  
I closed my eyes and I ran  
  
But I want to be

Woke up, it was a Chelsea mornin'  
And the first thing that I heard  
Was the song outside my window  
And the traffic wrote the words  
It came ringin' up like Christmas bells  
And rappin' up like pipes... and drums...  
  
Won't you stay  
We'll put on the day  
And we'll wear it 'til the night comes  
  
Woke up, it was a Chelsea mornin'  
And the first thing that I saw  
Was the sun through yellow curtains  
And a rainbow on my wall  
Red, green and gold to welcome you  
And crimson crystal beads... to beckon...  
  
Won't you stay  
We'll put on the day  
There's a sun shower every second  
  
Woke up, it was a Chelsea mornin'  
And the first thing that I knew  
There was milk and toast and honey  
And a bowl of oranges too  
And the light poured in like butterscotch  
And stuck to all my senses...  
  
Won't you stay  
We'll put on the day  
And we'll talk in present tenses

When a guy's been made a fool of  
By a gal who only wants to play  
He goes to a lonely place where lovers  
Who are broken hearted stay  
They call it  
Clown town, clown town  
No joy around town and you see  
That's just where I've been stayin'  
Since you made a clown out of me  
Baby, won't you come and get me  
I can't take it here another day  
It's not very hard to find  
It's no more than a broken heart away  
They call it  
Clown town, clown town  
No joy around town and you see  
That's just where I'll be stayin'  
Baby, till you set me free  
They call it  
Clown town, clown town  
No joy around town and you see  
That's just where I'll be stayin'  
Baby, till you set me free  
They call it  
Clown town, clown town  
No joy around town and you see  
That's just where I'll be stayin'  
Baby, till you set me free  
They call it  
Clown town, clown town,  
Come and get me baby

Oh, yes... Do it, man... Here we go)

Records playing  
  
Dancing in the street  
  
(all right girls, do it to me, here we go)

Pretty soon we were takin' it serious  
Me and you underneath a mysterious spell  
Nothin' I could do and it suddenly felt like a bolt out of hell  
I'm tellin' you  
To the sound of the beat I was hanging on  
Like a powerful truth, it was banging on me  
Wouldn't let me go  
Like a shot in the dark she was hot like a spark  
I only know  
Neither one of us trying to hold it down  
Neither one of us taking the middle ground  
Wasn't how to make sense we were thinkin' of  
Just the two of us bent on delirious love  
Me and you being spent on delirious love  
Like a ride on a rocket it took us up  
Didn't want it to stop and it shook us up good  
We were moving fast  
Just ahead of the law  
We were beggin' for more  
And what a blast  
Comin' round to a new kind of view of it  
Never did it before we were doin' it now  
And I gotta say it was easy to give  
Was a reason to live another day  
Neither one of us stopping to figure out  
What the roll and the rockin' was all about  
All we knew was that we couldn't get enough  
You and me in the heat of delirious love  
Makin' time to the beat of delirious love  
I can feel it  
I can feel it  
I can feel it  
  
Come down had a new kind of view of it  
Wouldn't do it before we were doin' it now  
And I gotta say it was easy to give  
Was a reason to live another day  
Neither one of us stoppin' to figure out  
What the roll and the rockin' was all about  
All we knew was that we couldn't get enough  
You and me in the heat of delirious love  
Makin' time to the beat of delirious love  
You and me gettin' sweet on delirious love

Dig in, Papa's coming home  
Dig in girl, Papa's coming home  
You know that soon, girl  
We'll be making up for time  
I've been gone  
  
Hang loose,  
Papa's on his way  
Hang loose child,  
Papa's on his way  
And when I get to you,  
I'll give you everything  
Every day  
  
Dig in, I say, dig in, girl  
Anyway, come on,  
Come on, come on  
Sing out, Papa's coming home  
Sing out child,  
Papa's coming home  
Gonna make some time  
For giving you girl  
Every little thing you want  
  
Oh dig in  
Go, I say dig in  
Do it baby  
Anyway I say  
Oh come on  
Dig in, hang loose, sing out

If you want to leave  
I won't beg you to stay  
And if you gotta go, darlin'  
Maybe, it's better that way  
  
I'm gonna be strong, gonna be fine  
Don't worry about this heart of mine  
Just walk out that door and see if I care  
Go on and go now  
  
But don't turn around  
'Cause you're gonna see my heart breaking  
Don't turn around  
I don't want you seeing me cry  
Just walk away  
It's tearing me apart that you're leaving  
I'm letting you go  
But I won't let you know  
  
I won't miss your arms around me  
Holding me tight, so tight, real tight  
And if you ever think about me  
Just know that I'll be all right  
  
I'm gonna be strong, gonna do fine  
Don't worry about this heart of mine  
I know I'll survive and I'll make it through  
And I'll even learn to live without you  
  
But don't turn around  
'Cause you're gonna see my heart breaking  
Don't turn around  
I don't want you seeing me cry  
Just walk away  
It's tearing me apart that you're leaving  
I'm letting you go  
But I won't let you know  
  
I wish I could cry out loud  
That I love you baby  
I wish I could say to you  
Don't go, don't go, don't go  
  
But don't turn around  
'Cause you're gonna see my heart breaking  
Don't turn around  
I don't want you seeing me cry  
Just walk away  
It's tearing me apart that you're leaving  
I'm letting you go  
But I won't let you know

First the tide rushes in  
Plants a kiss on the shore  
Then rolls out to sea  
And the sea is very still once more  
  
So I rush to your side  
Like the oncoming tide  
With one burning thought  
Will your arms open wide  
  
At last we're face to face  
And as we kiss through an embrace  
I can tell  
I can feel  
You are love  
You are really mine  
  
In the rain, in the dark, in the sun  
Like the tide at its ebb  
I'm at peace in the web  
Of your arms

Got a rock and roll ditty  
From the heart of the city  
To a country lane far away  
Drums are beatin'  
And the bass repeatin'  
And it rocks you to sleep just the same  
  
Sleep, safe and warm  
Dream cares be gone  
You know that it won't take long  
We'll be singin' Elijah's song  
Singin' Elijah's song  
  
Ya' got a rock and roll daddy  
And you make him so glad  
He's got a smile  
A mile across his face  
Movie star mom  
Gonna keep you safe from harm  
And she'll do it with style and grace  
  
Sleep, safe and warm  
Dream cares be gone  
You know that it won't be long  
We'll be singing Elijah's song  
Singin' Elijah's song  
  
Little bitty child when you laugh  
I smile  
It's a feelin' I won't ever forget  
Far from now  
When you're wanderin' 'round  
Here's a song that I left in your head  
Dream, that's what you do  
Dream, 'cause dreams come true  
Someday when you're big and strong  
You'll remember Elijah's song  
Remember Elijah's song  
Remember Elijah's song  
Remember Elijah's song

I go off to work everyday  
You think there's no other way  
And when there's time left to play  
You're thinkin' about her all the time  
You keep it all to yourself  
You trust in nobody else  
And the pressure just builds  
It can make you go crazy  
Falling  
I'm falling in love, again  
Falling  
I'm falling asleep  
Callin' your name once again, babe  
One more time, yeah  
The world is down on your back  
You know the things that you lack  
It really hard that's a fact  
When you want to do the right thing  
You got your doubts that you can  
Sometimes you don't understand  
What brings the best in a man  
Is it passion or power or  
Falling  
I'm falling in love again  
Falling  
I'm falling asleep  
Callin' your name once again, babe  
One more time, babe  
Fall into bed every night  
It seems you do nothing right  
You'd like to catch the next flight  
But you got your responsibilities  
She's feeling unsatisfied  
You feeling empty inside  
Like you've been took for a ride  
And there's no one at the steering wheel  
Falling  
I'm falling in love again  
Falling  
I'm falling asleep, callin' your name  
And I'm falling  
I'm falling in love again  
Falling  
I'm falling asleep, callin' your name  
And I'm falling  
I'm falling in love again

Farewell  
To all of the heartaches you brought  
So long  
To all of the tears I cried  
Goodbye  
To the bitter lesson you taught  
Farewell, so long, goodbye  
  
Through with having you walk on me now  
How many times can one person die?  
Once I was blinded  
But I can see now  
Farewell, so long, goodbye  
  
If there was some way to start again  
I'd try it  
But we both know  
It never can be  
Oh,  
Wish I could say I won't even miss you  
It's gonna hurt me and that's no lie  
But I'll get hurt more if I stay with you  
So Farwell, So long, Goodbye

Money talks  
But it don't sing and dance  
And it don't walk  
And long as I can have you here with me  
I'd much rather be  
Forever in blue jeans  
Honey's sweet  
But it ain't nothin' next to baby's treat  
And if you pardon me  
I'd like to say  
We'll do okay  
Forever in blue jeans  
  
Maybe tonight  
Maybe tonight, you and I  
All alone by the fire  
Nothing around  
But the sound of my heart  
And your sighs  
  
Money talks  
But it don't sing and dance  
And it don't walk  
And long as I can have you here with me  
I'd much rather be  
Forever in blue jeans, babe

Love you so much, can't count all the ways  
I'd die for you girl, and all they can say is  
"He's not your kind"  
  
They never get tired of puttin' me down  
And I never know when I come around  
What I'm gonna find  
Don't let them make up your mind  
Don't you know  
  
Girl, you'll be a woman soon  
Please come take my hand  
Girl, you'll be a woman soon  
Soon you'll need a man  
  
I've been misunderstood for all of my life  
But what they're sayin', girl, just cuts like a knife  
"The boy's no good"  
  
Well, I finally found what I've been looking for  
But if they get the chance, they'll end it for sure  
Sure they would  
Baby, I've done all I could  
It's up to you  
  
Girl, you'll be a woman soon  
Please come take my hand  
Girl, you'll be a woman soon  
Soon you'll need a man

Gitchy goomy, gitchy gaddy, sit you laddie down on your daddy's knee,  
And ain't it a nice place to be?  
Goggin noggin, papa's rockin' like a mockin' bird in a windy tree,  
And that ain't no place for me.  
Been there one time, been there two times,  
Been there three times more than I care to be,  
But we're gonna make it through, Gitchy Goomy.  
Life is good, life is fine, life is warm,  
Life is kind, can you see it?  
Love is great, love is right,  
Keeps you warm late at night when you need it.  
Baby boy, daddy's joy, life's a toy,  
But you don't want to break it.  
Like a sweet symphony, all you need is the key, you can play it.  
Gitchy goomy, gitchy gaddy, sit you laddie down while I have my say,  
Now don't be runnin' away.  
Goggin noggin, papa's talkin'  
Don't go walkin' off like you mean to play,  
Well, you can have it your way.  
Been there one time, been there two times,  
Been there three times more than I care to say,  
But you're gonna be O.K. Gitchy Goomy.  
Life is good, life is fine, life is warm,  
Life is kind, can you see it?  
Love is great, love is right,  
Keeps you warm late at night when you need it.  
Baby boy, daddy's joy, life's a toy,  
But you don't want to break it.  
Like a sweet symphony, all you need is the key, you can play it.  
Been there one time, been there two times,  
Been there three times more than I care to be,  
Seen it one time, seen it two times,  
Seen it three times, Lord 'n' it's plain to see.  
Ah, you gonna make it through Gitchy Goomy.  
You 'n' me gonna make it through Gitchy Goomy.  
Ah, you gonna make it through Gitchy Goomy.

Wearin' my high boots,  
Got all my world lies here in a sack  
Looking for something,  
Knowing that it ain't here where I'm at  
Ain't looking back  
I'm comin',  
Ride by thumbin',  
Get by bummin'  
I'm on my way  
  
Friend, have you seen glory road  
Say, friend, I got a heavy load,  
And I know glory road's waiting for me  
  
Caught me a pick-up  
Down from Seattle through to L.A.  
Seems like those folks  
Go chasin' a new star every day  
Ain't gonna stay  
In Nevada, through Wyomin',  
Colorado I'm on my way  
  
Friend, have you seen glory road  
Say, friend, I got a heavy load,  
And I know glory road's waiting for me  
  
Met so many others  
Wanted to know which way to go  
Louisiana, New York City  
They wanted the answer  
They'd ask of me.  
Friend, have you seen glory road?  
Say, friend, I got a heavy load  
And I know glory road's waiting for me  
Rest my load,  
Now I know glory road won't set me free

God rest you merry, gentlemen  
Let nothing you dismay  
Remember Christ our Savior  
Was born on Christmas Day  
To save us all from Satan's power  
When we were gone astray  
O tidings of comfort and joy  
Comfort and joy  
O tidings of comfort and joy  
From God our heavenly Father  
A blessed angel came  
And unto certain shepherds  
Brought tiding of the same  
How that in Bethlehem was born  
The Son of God by name  
O tidings of comfort and joy  
Comfort and joy  
O tidings of comfort and joy...  
And joy...

I know you worry everytime I go away  
You wonder will these sweet sweet feelings shine or fade  
But that's a question you don't have to ask  
What heaven makes, it always makes to last  
  
Gold don't rust, Love don't lie  
I'll be true, till the day that I die  
Trust in me, you will find  
Baby you're the gold in this heart of mine  
And that gold will shine for a long long time  
  
I wish that I could give you what you need from me  
But what good is a promise or a guarantee  
Love is still a simple act of faith  
And a faithful is heart is always worth the weight  
  
Gold don't rust, Love don't lie  
I'll be true, till the day that I die  
Trust in me, you will find  
Baby you're the gold in this heart of mine  
And that gold will shine for a long long time  
  
Love is still a simple act of faith  
And a faithful is heart is always worth the weight  
  
Gold don't rust, Love don't lie  
I'll be true, till the day that I die  
Trust in me, you will find  
Baby you're the gold in this heart of mine  
And that gold will shine for a long long time  
  
Baby you're the gold in this heart of mine  
And that gold will shine for a long, long long time

Now, since my baby left me  
I've found a new place to dwell  
Down at the end of lonely street  
At Heartbreak Hotel  
  
I get so lonely, baby, I get so lonely  
I get so lonely, I could die  
  
Although it's always crowded  
You still can find some room  
For broken hearted lovers  
To cry away their gloom  
  
I get so lonely, baby, I get so lonely  
I get so lonely, I could die  
  
The bell hop's tears keep flowing  
The desk clerk's dressed in black  
They've been so long lonely street  
They will never go back  
  
I get so lonely, baby, I get so lonely  
I get so lonely, I could die  
  
So if your baby leaves you and you have a tale to tell  
Just take a walk down lonely street to Heartbreak Hotel  
  
I get so lonely, baby, I get so lonely  
I get so lonely, I could die

Hello again hello  
I just called to say hello  
I couldn't sleep  
At all tonight  
And I know its late  
I just couldn't wait  
  
Hello my friends hello  
I just called to let you know  
I think about you every night  
When I'm here alone  
And your there at home  
Hello  
  
Lately it's been crazy  
Maybe I'm to blame  
But I put my heart above your head  
We've been through it all and you love me just the same  
And when your not there  
I still need to hear  
  
Hello again hello  
Its good to need you so  
Its good to love you like I do  
I feel this way when I hear you say  
Hello  
  
Hello my friend hello  
Just called to let you know  
I think about you every night  
And I know it's late but I could't wait  
Hello.

Half a day from nowhere  
Hurrying to get there  
Ninety miles an hour  
In two Plymouth wagons  
The Avis lady gave us a smile  
Tom's getting uptight  
Max'll will make it all right  
Ken's asleep in back  
Artie's reading a map  
That's takin' us where we're heading to  
We should be there soon  
There's a sign up ahead  
Wash my face and get fed  
And that voice in my head  
Keeps sayin' I'm lonely  
But I'm only payin' my dues  
Holiday Inn Blues  
Had a reservation, best accommodations  
We get the word, they never heard  
We were comin' by at all  
See what they can do for me  
Only got one room free  
Little bit confined  
But if you guys don't mind  
We'll put you up in our bridal suite  
The view can't be beat  
And a fine view they got  
Of a new parking lot  
And I can't repeat what's in my mind  
As I lay back resigned  
And I kick off my shoes  
Holiday Inn blues  
Time to put a show on  
Gettin' time to go on  
People call for more  
We do two encores  
Take our bows and we're feelin' fine  
We got to unwind  
Want some coffee, but then  
This town closes at ten  
Looks like I'm gonna spend  
One more night by the light  
Of the late show  
And Charlie Chan's crew  
Holiday Inn blues  
Holiday Inn blues  
I feel so down  
Holiday Inn blues  
What am I gonna do?

I can't stop this feeling  
Deep inside of me  
Girl, you just don't realise  
What you do to me  
  
When you hold me  
In your arms so tight  
You let me know  
Everything's all right  
  
CHORUS  
I, I'm hooked on a feeling  
Im high on believing  
That your in love with me  
  
Lips as sweet as candy  
Its taste is on my mind  
Girl you've got me thirsty  
For another cup of wine  
  
Got a bug from you, Girl  
But I don't need no cure  
I'll just stay a victim  
If i can for sure  
  
All the good love  
When we're all alone  
Keep it up Girl  
Yeah, you turn me on  
  
CHORUS  
  
All the good love  
When we're all alone  
Keep it up Girl  
Yeah, you turn me on  
  
CHORUS  
  
I'm hooked on a feeling  
And im high on believing  
That your in love with me  
  
I said I'm hooked on a feeling...  
And im high on believing  
That your in love with me  
Hooked on a feeling  
  
[Words by Bjorn Skifs]

Stay with me, here with me  
I want you near with me  
I'm a man  
That's hooked on the memory  
Of you and I, who knows why?  
I only know that I'm sure, I am  
Hooked on the memory of you  
  
Time, time standing still  
I know it's you, I always will  
Need you too,  
Lay with me, lie with me  
Spend your desire with me, if you can  
I'm hooked on the memory  
Of you and I, who knows why?  
I guess I just wanted for you to be  
Hooked on the memory of me  
  
Time, time standing still,  
I know it's you, I always will  
Want you to, be here with me  
I want you to stay right here with me  
I need you to love with me,  
Laugh with me,  
Forgive the past with me  
I know you can  
  
I'm hooked on the memory  
Of you and I, who knows why?  
Guess I just wanted for you to be  
Hooked on the memory of me  
Oh you know that it's true  
Not a thing I can do  
I'm hooked on the memory of you

I stopped askin' why  
Girl, the well's gone dry  
Time to say the words I'm sayin'  
And hurtin' you don't come easy  
  
God only knows,  
Hurtin' you don't come easy  
But I need to go  
Thought we had it once  
  
But what was once, was once  
Time can change  
Both dreams and dreamers  
And hurtin' you don't come easy  
  
God only knows  
Hurtin' you don't come easy  
But I need to go  
I need to find what I ain't found  
  
I'll may be lookin' for it  
'Til the last day I'm alive  
Don't ask me what I'll do  
Don't ask me where I'm bound  
  
I just know I'm not alive  
Unless I can get up and try  
And hurtin' you don't come easy  
God only knows  
  
Hurtin' you don't come easy  
But I need to go.  
Hurtin' you don't come easy  
God only knows...

Two broken hearts lonely looking houses  
Where nobody lives  
Two people each having so much pride inside  
Neither side forgives  
  
Angry words spoken in haste  
Such a waste of two lives  
Its my belief  
Pride is the chief cause in the decline  
In the number of husbands and wives  
  
[Chorus]  
A woman and a man  
A man and a woman  
Some can and some can't and some can't  
  
Two broken hearts lonely looking houses  
Where nobody lives  
Two people each having so much pride inside  
Neither side forgives  
  
Angry words spoken in haste  
Such a waste of two lives  
Its my belief  
Pride is the chief cause in the decline  
In the number of husbands and wives  
  
[Chorus]

There was a flood and many poor men were killed.  
And that is why our house is built on the top of a hill.  
The plains are like a friend, why can't we live on them?  
And if a flood should come, why can't we run?  
  
I am the lion, bellowing out in the night.  
We had a cow, I left it alone to graze.  
And walked to the stream and when I returned, it was stolen away.  
But now the cow is gone and we don't need a farm.  
  
We have not one thing they  
Would steal away.  
  
I am the lion bellowing out at the night.  
I am the lion bellowing out at the night.  
I am... the lion.

I believe in happy endings  
Starry skies and dreams come true  
I've believed it since I first met you  
I believe in new beginnings  
Extra innings, brand new starts  
Loving hearts that care the way I do  
All these things and happy endings too  
Sad songs bring me right down with the blues  
Glad songs take me wherever I choose  
And I choose to be there  
So that I  
Can declare why  
I believe in happy endings  
You're the reason, love's the way  
And I'll believe it till my dying day  
I know the cost of tears and trouble  
Some get lost, some make it through  
Me, I made it, 'cause I always knew  
That you believed in happy endings too  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
Sad songs bring me right down with the blues  
Glad songs take me wherever I choose  
And I choose to be there  
So that I  
Can declare  
I know the cost of tears and trouble  
I got lost, but I got through  
And I made it, 'cause I always knew  
That you believed in happy endings too  
You and me and happy endings too

Tommy sends you flowers  
Lots of pretty things  
Johnny buys you ribbons for your hair  
They all send you presents  
And because I know  
You tell me that I don't really care  
But I care enough to give the very best  
  
I'd like to buy you things like all the rest  
I know how much these little things can mean  
But all that I can give you are my dreams  
  
Billy takes you driving in his brand new car  
Frankie takes you to the movie show  
If you think I don't care  
That they love you more  
Look into my eyes and you will know  
That I care enough to give the very best  
  
I'd like to buy you things like all the rest  
So darling please believe the things I say  
So let me love you in my special way  
Because I care enough to give the very best  
Because I care enough to give the very best

Your eyes say  
You've been heartache and more  
I know 'cause girl  
I've walked that road before  
But baby,  
You can just forget  
That word called cry  
'Cause I'll be there right beside you  
  
And, I got love for you,  
Baby all I got to give.  
I got love for you for as long as I live  
Let me see your smile now, girl  
  
Baby don't look back  
To where you've been  
It won't ever be that way again  
There's not a lot of things  
That I got plenty of  
But love believe what I'm sayin',  
  
Cause, I got love for you  
Baby all I got to give  
I got love for you for as long as I live  
It's gotta be alright now  
  
There'll be no one doin' you harm  
No, don't be afraid, child  
Love, you're safe in my arms  
Gonna be no hurt, never no more  
No pain, not like before  
No fears, baby, for sure  
Just love forever more  
  
Cause, I got love for you  
Baby all I got to give  
I got love for you for as long as I live  
So hold me tight now  
So hold me tight now,  
Baby......

I seek the night  
And I rest my head  
On my weary bed  
And I think about you  
  
And time's on my mind  
I've been thinking about  
What I'm doing without  
With a boy like you  
What's a girl to do  
  
Yesterday was more or less  
Just like the day before  
And time don't matter  
When there's nobody else around  
  
Yesterday is dead and gone  
And all I believe is in now  
I believe and how my time has come  
  
Why sleep at all  
Just to rest my head  
On a lonely bed  
And to dream alone  
  
Time's on my mind  
And the last I heard  
He was like a bird  
Don't know where he flew  
And what's a girl to do  
  
What's a girl to do  
What's a girl to do

Broken windows  
In empty hallways  
A pale dead moon  
In a sky streaked with gray  
  
Human kindness is overflowing  
And I think it's gonna rain today  
Scarecrows dressed in the latest styles  
With frozen smiles to chase love away  
  
Human kindness is overflowing  
And I think it's gonna to rain today  
Lonely, lonely  
Tin can at my feet  
  
Kick it down the street  
And that's the way to treat a friend  
Right before me  
The signs implore me  
  
Help the needy  
And show them the way  
Human kindness, is overflowing  
And I think it's gonna to rain today

Where I am, what I am  
You're the only reason  
Held me up, filled my cup,  
Had the faith in me and love....  
  
Owe it all to you, knowin' we're in love  
There's nothing I can't do  
And I'm not afraid to lose my way  
'Cause if I walk a crooked street  
You're there to lead me home  
  
I've been through bad times  
And some times worse  
And till I met you 'happy' was just a word  
But that all changed the day you came  
Now if I walk a crooked street  
You're there to lead me home  
  
[Guitar instrumental]  
  
And I'm not afraid to lose my way  
'Cause if I walk a crooked street  
You're there to lead me home  
If I walk a crooked street  
You're there to lead me home

If I lost my way  
Would you stand with me  
Would you love me still  
And care for what I need  
If I lost my way  
  
If I lost my faith  
To face up to the test  
Would I let you down  
Would you love me less  
If I lost my way  
  
Tell me I'm afraid without good reasons  
Say that I'm a fool to feel this way  
Could it be the me that you believed in  
Is all you really need to make you stay  
If I lost my way  
If I lost my way  
  
If I lost my dreams  
Could I keep your trust  
Promise that our love  
Would not turn to dust  
If I lost my way  
  
Tell me I'm afraid without good reasons  
Say that I'm a fool to feel this way  
Could it be the me that you believed in  
Is all you really need to make you stay  
If I lost my way  
Would you stand with me  
Would you love me still  
And care for what I need  
If I lost my way  
  
If I lost my way  
If I lost my way  
If I lost my way

I know your kind, you pick a girl (guy)  
Then change your mind and have a whirl  
Now the gals (guys) that you've kissed say  
I'm next on your list, uh, uh, baby....  
I'm nobody's fool  
  
You had you're fun by telling lies  
And now you've come to claim this prize  
Uh, uh baby  
I'm nobody's fool  
  
I've heard your ev'ry lie  
Dear, it's the same old tune  
Don't even waste your time here  
Baby, I'm immune  
  
Just turn around, be on your way  
Don't hang around it doesn't pay  
Cause I won't take a chance  
On a one way romance  
Uh, uh baby  
I'm nobody's fool

Won't you come into the living room  
We can talk about  
The way that we see this  
You can snuggle in my easy chair  
And I can tell you about  
The man that I really am  
We can talk about the family  
Or we can talk about the things  
That you've been missin'  
What's missing  
If you want someone who's listening  
I'm your man, oh yeah  
I'm your man, a-ha  
  
Do you want to see a photograph  
It's a picture of the two of us together  
Got to be my favorite photograph  
From a time I know  
I'll always remember  
Now we got a little family  
Can't you see that I'm a man who's  
Just discovered what love is  
And one thing leads to another  
But I'm your man, oh yeah  
I'm your man a-ha  
  
Can't you come into the living room  
Got a few important things  
I want to talk about  
Won't you meet me in the living room  
Stay around until there's not a single doubt  
That I love you, yes I love you  
When you need someone who loves you  
I'm you man, a-ha  
I'm your man, oh yeah  
I'm your man

It comes and goes  
The feeling I've been feeling  
When she comes it grows  
I know it's just a feeling  
But when she's around  
I get the feeling  
That I'm in some other world  
Like some other girl  
And when she calls her name  
I don't know what it is  
But it's just not the same  
I don't know what's been missing  
But I know it's gone  
I feel it from  
My head way down to my toes  
It comes and goes  
  
She still really cares  
And I'm not being smart  
I might of been imagining all the time  
Who's to say the feeling  
I feel in my heart  
Won't turn out to be all in my mind  
It hurts me  
  
It comes and goes  
It comes and goes  
  
Oh baby  
She still really cares  
And I'm not being smart  
I might of been imagining all the time  
Who's to say the feeling  
I feel in my heart  
Won't turn out to be all in my mind  
  
And yet when we're alone  
She makes me feel like some old toy  
That's been outgrown  
As tho' I were just some old boy  
She hardly known  
I can't help feeling  
How the feeling comes and goes  
She comes and goes with someone new

Likely, it don't seem likely  
Faithless love, getting me down  
Got your head spinning around  
With faithless love, it ain't my style  
Take my hand, stay for a while  
You may think that I could walk away  
And think that I don't plan to stay  
Well, you think what you want  
Me, I say that it don't seem likely  
Oh no,  
'Cause it all really matters  
Take a look at it my way  
I want to keep it together  
Likely, it don't seem likely  
  
Look ahead, what do you see  
Simple times, times made of need  
Life to day moves with the tide  
Stormy seas, harbor of light  
You may think that I could turn and go  
Run away with any so-and-so  
Well you think what you like  
Me, I know  
That it don't seem likely  
Oh no  
See a whole lot of sense an'  
Take a look at it my way  
Oh, yeah  
It don't seem likely  
  
You'll finally get it when you're least aware  
Out alone, or in your easy chair  
It's so slow, but you'll know  
That I care  
But it don't seem likely  
Cause I know it really matters  
Take a look at it my way  
I want to keep us together  
Though it don't seem likely, oh no  
'Cause I know what really matters  
I want to keep it together  
Though it don't seem likely  
Oh no,  
Likely

Just another guy that you see around  
No more than a face  
Somewhere in the crowd  
Then when you pass  
I 'm feeling sorrow  
'Cause you're so near  
Yet, you're so far away  
  
I know that I'm a fool for wanting  
What I can't have  
If I say I loved you you'd only laugh  
So each night I'd dream that you're mine  
And wake each morning only to find  
That I'm just another guy  
  
I know in my heart that  
I don't stand a chance  
But I just can't end this one way romance  
  
Maybe someday  
I'll be there by your side  
But if I remain just another guy  
You'll be here in my heart forever  
And I know that darlin' you'll never be  
Just another girl to me

Lady-oh, lady-oh, I walked the streets again last night.  
I saw you in the city light like a vision, lady-oh.  
Lady I, lady I, I've been waitin' around such a long long time  
Believin' I could make you mine, just wanting you lady-oh.  
But here I am and there you are, much too far to even hear me.  
Hurts a lot, you know it does, it hurts a lot.  
Oh, lady-oh, am I gonna ever learn what I never learned before?  
City lights, city lights burn so warm and they burn so bright,  
But me, I walk the city night to forget you, lady-oh.  
But here I am and there you are, much too far to even hear me.  
Hurts a lot, you know it does, it hurts a lot.  
Oh, lady-oh, am I gonna ever learn what I never learned before

Lay, lady lay  
Come lay across my big brass bed  
And stay, lady stay  
Stay while the night,  
The night is still here  
  
Whatever colors you have in your mind  
I'll show them to you  
And you can see them shine  
  
Lay, lady lay  
Come lay across my big brass bed  
And stay, lady stay  
Stay with your man  
Just a little while  
  
His clothes are dirty  
But his hands are clean  
And you're the best thing  
He's ever seen  
And stay, lady stay  
Stay with you man  
Just a little while  
Til the break of day  
  
Come on, let me see you  
Make him smile  
Why wait any longer  
For the world to begin  
You can have your cake  
And eat it too  
Why wait any longer  
For the one that you love  
Why he's standing right in front of you  
  
Come lay, lady lay  
Come lay across my big brass bed  
And stay, lady stay  
Stay while the night is still ahead....

You'll be better off, I know  
With another kind of man  
All I've got is what I feel  
And what I feel is what I am  
  
But let me take you in my arms again  
Let me take you in my arms and then  
Let me see behind your smile  
Let me love you like a child  
Let me take you in my arms  
  
I'm like a train that's rollin' on a track  
Like a train that's got no turnin' back  
Let me keep you from the storm  
Let me make you safe and warm  
Let me take you in my arms  
  
You'll be better off, I know  
With another kind of man  
All I've got is what I feel  
But what I feel is what I am  
  
Let me take you in my arms again  
Won't be easy, but I'll learn to bend  
Like a ship without a sail  
On a sea without a trail  
Let me take you in my arms  
  
You'll be better off, I know  
With another kind of man  
All I've got is what I feel  
But what I feel is what I am  
  
Let me take you in my arms again  
Won't be easy, but I'll learn to bend  
Like a ship without a sail  
On a sea without a trail  
Let me take you in my arms  
  
But let me take you in my arms again  
Let me take you in my arms and then  
Let me see behind your smile  
Let me love you like a child  
Let me take you in my arms  
  
Let me take you in my arms again  
Let me take you in my arms and then  
Let me see behind your smile  
Let me love you like a child  
Let me take you in my arms  
  
Let me take you in my arms again

Take you back to a cotton field  
In the heart of Louisiana  
Little boy about nine years old  
Sings a song in the heat of the day  
Mama cried when her little boy sang  
She knew he could be someone special  
Mama cried 'cause the way that it was  
He would only be wasted away  
  
Then his mama would pray  
And every night she would say  
Help my boy began  
Take the lord by the hand  
  
Let the little boy sing  
Got a feeling that takes you home  
Got a melody of his own  
Let the little boy sing  
  
Let the little boy try  
Let the little boy buy  
He can take you along  
On the wings of his song  
Let the little boy fly  
  
Take you back to New Orleans  
Where the music wakes up with the city  
To the bars by the railroad cars  
On the neon side of town  
Sang a song on the city streets  
And people began to listen  
Southern boy, sing your southern song  
Take it like no one around  
  
Nobody walked by  
Without feelin' high  
Never heard it before  
They'd be calling for more  
  
Let the little boy sing  
Got a melody of his own  
Got a feeling that takes you home  
Let the little boy sing  
And let the little boy fly  
Let the little boy try  
He can take you along  
On the wings of his song  
Let the little boy fly  
  
Let him take you away  
  
(Ladies and gentlemen  
Super?? are proud to introduce  
The little boy with a soul of a star)  
  
Let the little boy sing  
Got a melody of his own  
Got a feeling that takes you home  
Let the little boy sing  
Let the little boy try  
Let the little boy buy  
He can take you along  
On the wings of his song  
Let the little boy fly

Love never doubts or suffers or cries  
Love shows no fear, love tells no lies  
And love will never leave me in the dark  
No, love never breaks my heart  
Like you do, like you do  
  
Love doesn't have unapproachable walls  
Or a heart that beckons and then withdraws  
And love would never steal my dignity  
Love has never made a fool of me  
Like you do, like you do  
  
Oh, and I have known times  
When love seems unsure  
But when love is unkind  
It is not love anymore  
  
Love never threatens of frightens me  
It's not held together with apologies  
Love never screams my name  
No, and love never turns away  
Like you do, like you do  
  
And I have known times  
When love seems unsure  
But when love maybe unkind  
Love never turns away  
Like you do, like you do  
  
Like you do, like you do

Listen  
You don't even know my name  
But I wear it just the same  
And you know I won't be long  
Will you listen to my song  
  
Listen  
Play it here with my guitar  
Gonna make someone a star  
You can even sing along  
When you listen to my song  
  
Hang on  
Got a different kind of sound  
Moving up to higher ground  
Would you listen, listen, listen  
Would you listen to my song  
  
Listen  
Do you hear the sound of change?  
Like a distant rolling train  
But it won't be distant long  
Would you listen to my song  
  
And I know  
Got a bumpy road ahead  
But the music makes my bed  
Would you listen, listen, listen  
Would you listen to my song  
  
Listen  
Listen  
  
Listen  
Listen  
  
Say friend,  
Do you know a place inside  
Where a boy could spend a night  
Well you know it won't be long  
When they listen to my song  
  
And I know  
Got a bumpy road ahead  
But the music makes my bed  
Would you listen, listen, listen  
Would you listen to my song  
  
Listen  
Listen  
  
Listen  
Listen  
Listen to my song

Lonely lookin sky  
Lonely sky, lonely looking sky  
And bein' lonely  
Makes you wonder why  
Makes you wonder why  
Lonely looking sky  
Lonely looking sky  
Lonely looking sky  
  
Lonely looking night  
Lonely night, lonely looking night  
And bein' lonely  
Never made it right  
Never made it right  
Lonely looking night  
Lonely looking night  
Lonely looking night  
  
Sleep we sleep  
For we may dream  
While we may  
Dream we dream  
For we may wake  
One more day  
One more day  
  
Glory looking day  
Glory day, glory looking day  
And all it's glory  
Told a simple way  
Behold it if you may  
Glory looking day  
Glory looking day  
Lonely looking sky

Lonfellow serenade  
Such were the plans I'd made  
For she was a lady  
And I was a dreamer  
With only words to trade  
You know that I was born for a night like this  
Warmed by a stolen kiss  
For I was lonely  
And she was lonely  
  
Ride, come on baby, ride  
Let me make your dreams come true  
I'll sing my song  
Let me make it warm for you  
  
I'll weave his web of rhyme  
Upon the summer night  
We'll leave this worldly time  
On his winged flight  
  
Then come, and as we lay  
Beside this sleepy glade  
There I will sing to you  
My Longfellow serenade  
  
Longfellow serenade  
Such were the plans I made  
But she was a lady  
As deep as a river  
And through the night, we stayed  
  
And in my way, I loved her as none before  
Loved her with words and more  
For she was lonely  
And I was lonely  
  
Ride, come on baby, ride  
Let me make you dreams come true  
I'll sing my song  
Let me sing my song  
Let me make it warm for you  
  
I'll weave this web of rhyme  
Upon the summer night  
We'll leave this worldly time  
On his winged flight  
  
Then come, and as we lay  
Beside this sleepy glade  
There I will sing to you  
My Longfellow serenade

Look out, here comes tomorrow  
That's when I'll have to choose  
How I wish I could borrow  
Someone else's shoes  
  
Mary, oh what a sweet girl  
Lips like strawberry pie  
Sandra, the long hair and pig tails  
Can't make up my mind  
I see all kinds of sorrow  
Wish I loved only one  
Look out here comes tomorrow  
Oh how I wish  
Tomorrow would never come  
  
Told them both that I loved them  
Said it, and it was true  
But I can't have both of them  
Don't know what to do  
  
I see all kinds of sorrow  
Wish I loved only one  
Look out here comes tomorrow  
Oh how I wish  
Tomorrow would never come  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
I see all kinds of sorrow  
Wish I loved only one  
Look out here comes tomorrow  
Oh how I wish  
Tomorrow would never come

Louie, Louie, me gotta go.  
Louie, Louie, me gotta go.  
  
A fine little girl, she wait for me.  
Me catch the ship across the sea.  
I sailed the ship all alone  
I never think I'll make it home.  
  
Louie, Louie, me gotta go.  
Louie, Louie, me gotta go.  
  
Three nights and days we sailed the sea.  
Me think of girl constantly.  
On the ship I dream she there.  
I smell the rose in her hair.  
  
Louie, Louie, me gotta go.  
Louie, Louie, me gotta go.  
  
Me see Jamaican moon above.  
It won't be long me see me love  
Me take her in my arms and then I tell her  
I never leave again.  
  
Louie, Louie, me gotta go.  
Louie, Louie, me gotta go.

See what you do  
You make me act so crazy  
I'm overcome, I know  
Stealin' my own show  
  
For your love  
And who am I now, Clown or Casanova  
I'm never sure with you  
And what more can I do  
  
For your love burns  
Warmer than you know  
When love burns,  
Never let it go away  
  
And where do we go  
Find a road to lead us  
I'm searching in your eyes  
A world beyond the skies  
  
For your love burns  
Brighter than you know  
When love burns,  
Never let it go away  
  
Love burns  
Brighter than you know  
Oh, love burns  
Never let it go away  
  
Love burns when the spirit is wounded  
Cut deep by the sound of rejection  
Love burns in the soul of the seeker  
Blue shadows in every direction  
  
Love burns when the heart is uncovered  
In the rage of the coldly storm  
Love burns  
Through the night and the morning  
  
Till the frozen heart is warm  
Love burns  
Love burns  
Love burns  
Love burns

Love on the rocks  
Ain't no surprise  
Pour me a drink  
And I'll tell you some lies  
Got nothin' to lose  
So you just sing the blues all the time  
  
Gave you my heart  
Gave you my soul  
You left me alone here  
With nothing to hold  
Yesterday's gone  
Now all I want is a smile  
  
First, they say they want you  
How they really need you  
Suddenly you find you're out there  
Walking in a storm  
When they know they have you  
Then they really have you  
Nothing you can do or say  
You've got to leave, just get away  
We all know the song  
  
You need what you need  
You can say what you want  
Not much you can do  
When the feeling is gone  
May be blue skies above  
But it's cold when you love's on the rocks  
  
First, they say they want you  
How they really need you  
Suddenly you find you're out there  
Walking in a storm  
When they know they have you  
Then they really have you  
Nothing you can do or say  
You've got to leave, just get away  
We all know the song  
  
Love on the rocks  
Ain't no surprise  
Pour me a drink  
And I'll tell you some lies  
Yesterday's gone  
And now all I want is a smile

The words I have to say  
May well be simple but they're true  
Until you give your love  
There's nothing more that we can do  
  
Love is the opening door  
Love is what we came here for  
No one could offer you more  
Do you know what I mean  
Have your eyes really seen  
  
You say its very hard  
To leave behind the life we knew  
But there's no other way  
Now it's really up to you  
  
Love is the key we must turn  
Truth is the flame we must burn  
Freedom's the lesson we learn  
Do you know what I mean  
Have your eyes really seen  
  
Love is the key we must turn  
Truth is the flame we must burn  
Freedom's the lesson we learn  
Do you know what I mean  
Have your eyes really seen  
  
Do you know what I mean  
Have your eyes really seen

Love's a thing that needs wants to thrive on  
Then it grows  
At least that's what I've been told  
You can't love someone  
If you find that all you get in return  
Is a heart that's cold  
They say you need love to love  
You gotta have love to love  
They all say it works that way  
But if it's true  
Why do I love you  
Seems like you keep tryin' to break me  
You do things designed just to make me cry  
And I've heard if warm lips don't touch you  
Love won't grow no matter  
How much you try  
They say you need love to love  
You gotta have love to love  
They all say it works that way  
But if it's true  
Why do I love you  
They say you need love to love  
You gotta have love to love  
They all say it works that way  
But if it's true  
Why do I love you  
Why do I love you  
Like I do

I could fall in love with the proper stranger  
If I heard the bells and the banjos ring  
If two certain eyes with the look of danger  
Smiled a welcome warm as spring  
If the beating in my heart  
Sounded out a warning  
"Don't let her,"  
"Don't let her walk through the door"  
"This is the one you've been waiting for"  
Oh, yes, I'd know  
However wild it seems,  
You know I'd know  
And I'd whisper  
"Come take my hand, proper stranger"  
"Don't go through life as a stranger"  
"For I'm a poor proper stranger, too"  
"Don't let her,"  
"Don't let her walk through the door"  
"This is the one you've been waiting for"  
Oh, yes, I'd know  
However wild it seems,  
You know I'd know  
And I'd whisper  
"Come take my hand, proper stranger"  
"Don't go through life as a stranger"  
"For I'm a poor proper stranger, too"

Make believe we're in love  
Let's pretend that we share eternity  
Make believe, come with me far away  
Let's just you and I  
Bid this world goodbye  
  
Make believe  
Make my life worth living  
Stand by me to the end  
Happiness comes in giving  
Is it so hard to pretend?  
  
Close your eyes, take my hand  
I may be a fool  
Still I pray that you'll  
Make believe  
  
Make believe we're in love  
Why can't you pretend  
That we're more than friends  
Make believe, come with me far away  
Fill each lonely night  
With a love that's right  
  
Make believe  
Make my live worth living  
Stand by me to the end  
Happiness comes in giving  
Is it so hard to pretend?  
  
Close your eyes, dream with me  
I may be a fool  
Still I pray that you'll  
Make believe

Say that you'll marry me  
Sometimes carry me  
And I will be there forever more  
For you  
  
And if you marry me  
I will give everything  
And I will do anything that you need  
We do  
  
You'll know, by the love in my eyes  
And the beat of my heart  
I'll be there  
  
You'll know, cause you'll never be lonely again  
Anytime anywhere  
This I promise  
If you Marry me  
  
Promise you'll stay with me  
We'll make some memories  
And maybe a dream or two  
Will come true, who knows  
  
This I can say for sure  
All that I have is yours  
You'll never wonder where I stand  
It shows  
  
You'll know, by the love in my eyes  
And the beat of my heart  
I'll be there  
  
You'll know, cause you'll never be lonely again  
Anytime anywhere  
All I promise you I will be  
If you'll only say you'll Marry me  
  
I won't ever forget these words  
And I'll love you for all I'm worth  
If you say you will Marry me  
Won't you Marry me  
  
Marry me

I'm sittin' on a mountain  
Searchin' for an answer  
Hopin' there's a chance  
That she'll be comin' back to me  
Midnight dream  
I'm waitin' on the mountain  
Thinkin' I can find her  
Maybe if I find her,  
Here is where she'll want to be  
Midnight dream  
I made my way down to Mexico  
I spend a year travelin' 'cross the ocean  
Without goin' anywhere  
A hundred miles to the nearest phone  
A thousand miles from a place called home  
And all alone in my despair  
I'd call you there  
My midnight dream  
So I'm sittin' on a mountain  
Lookin' 'cross a river  
Needin' to be with her  
More than I believed I'd be  
Midnight dream  
I'm sittin' all alone now  
Knowin' what I know now  
Thought I'd be a teacher  
But she would end up teachin' me  
Midnight dream  
I know that I lost my way one night  
But if you ask me  
It don't seem right  
To spend my life without you there  
And so I climbed to the highest peak  
Just hopin' somehow that I what I seek  
Will somehow speak and you'll appear  
My midnight dream  
Where are you, don't let go  
So I'm sittin' on a mountain  
How can I explain it  
I'm livin' with the pain of thinkin' how it  
Still could be  
Midnight dream  
Love is what I'm thinkin'  
No two ways about it  
Go too long without it,  
Nothing really means a thing  
Midnight dream  
But if you haven't decided yet  
Might be the only chance we get  
Let's don't forget 'bout you and me  
I finally ended where I began  
You see before you  
The sorry soul, the lonely man  
I've come to be  
Please come to me  
My midnight dream  
Oh come to me  
My midnight dream

Monday, Monday  
So good to me  
Monday morning,  
It was all I hoped it would be  
  
Oh, Monday morning  
Monday morning couldn't guarantee  
That Monday evening  
You would still be here with me  
  
Monday, Monday  
Can't trust that day  
Monday, Monday  
Sometimes it just turns out that way  
  
Oh, Monday morning  
You gave me no warning  
Of what was to be  
Oh, Monday, Monday  
  
How could you leave and not take me  
Every other day  
Every other day,  
Every other day of the week is fine, yeah  
  
But whenever Monday comes  
But whenever Monday comes  
You can find me crying all of the time  
Monday, Monday  
  
So good to me  
Monday morning  
It was all I hoped it would be  
Oh, Monday morning  
  
Monday morning couldn't guarantee  
That Monday evening  
You would still be here with me  
  
Every other day  
Every other day  
Every other day of the week is fine, yeah  
  
But whenever Monday comes  
But whenever Monday comes  
You can find me crying all of the time  
Monday, Monday  
  
Can't trust that day  
Monday, Monday  
Turns out that way  
Monday, Monday

Hey, just for one last time  
I'll sing my song just like I did before  
When we were all young  
Can you still recall how it was sung?  
  
The songs are only rhymes  
Life don't turn out  
The way we thought it would  
When we were all young  
Used to love to hear them love songs sung  
  
I was the moonlight rider  
I'd ride out on a sea of dreams  
Far away, long ago, so it seems  
Won't you take  
That moonlight ride with me?  
  
Well, just for one last time  
I'll sing my song just like I did before  
Maybe you'll sing along  
Do you still recall that moonlight song?  
  
I am the moonlight rider  
I'm riding on a sea of dreams  
Far away, long ago, so it seems  
Won't you take  
That moonlight ride with me?

Oh yes,  
Say it now  
  
Morning has broken,  
Like the first morning  
Blackbird has spoken,  
Like the first bird  
  
Praise for the singing,  
Praise for the morning  
Praise for them springing  
Fresh from the world  
  
Sweet the rain's new fall,  
Sunlit from heaven  
Like the first dewfall,  
On the first grass  
Praise for the sweetness  
Of the wet garden  
Sprung in completeness  
Where his feet pass  
  
Mine is the sunlight,  
Mine is the morning  
Born of the one light,  
Eden saw play  
  
Praise with elation,  
Praise every morning  
God's re-creation  
Of the new day

Every night in my dreams  
I see you, I feel you  
That is how I know you go on  
Far across the distance  
And spaces between us  
You have come to show you go on  
Near, far, wherever you are  
I believe that the heart does go on  
Once more, you opened the door  
And you're here in my heart  
And my heart will go on and on  
Love can touch us one time  
And last for a lifetime  
And never let go till we're gone  
Love was when I loved you  
One true time to hold to  
In my life we'll always go on  
Near, far, wherever you are  
I believe that the heart does go on  
Once more, you opened the door  
And you're here in my heart  
And my heart will go on and on  
You're here  
There's nothing I fear  
'Cause I know that my heart  
Will go on and on  
And on and on and on  
My heart will go on and on

You are my special someone  
All I will ever need  
I know I'd be lost without you  
I hope you'd be lost without me  
I've searched alone  
But your the only one  
You're what I want  
When things are said and done  
I guess I only needed  
Someone who was just like you  
Someone who'd be  
My special someone too  
I stumbled down love's main highway  
But not without takin' some falls  
I've seen my illusions fly away  
Until I had none left at all  
And then you rescued  
What was left of me  
What maybe some would call a fantasy  
But me, I'd have to say it only proves  
How strange love moves  
I need to be your special someone too  
'Cause what I needed most  
Is what she gave to me  
And where she lays her head  
Is where I want to be  
There's something wrong with losing  
What we finally found  
Now when I've lost my way  
I've got my special someone round  
And when she needed love  
She found it here with me  
Now where I lay my head  
Is where she wants to be  
I've got a secret but it's one  
That's hard to keep  
I want to tell the world  
That special someone is my girl  
That special someone is my girl  
She wants to be my special someone too

Make up your mind what you want  
Nathaniel B Jackson  
  
You can see that I'm sorry  
For runnin' 'round with someone new  
But I know you don't mean it  
And mister till I think you do  
You can keep al your hugs  
Don't want your kisses  
You had to many tries  
And too many misses  
  
Make up your mind what you want  
Nathaniel B Jackson  
  
If you think that I'm greedy  
For wanting you all to myself  
Well you're right, yes indeedy  
I won't share your love with no one else  
And if you think  
That your lies are gonna hurt me  
Well you just think again  
'Cause you don't know me  
  
Make up your mind what you want  
Nathaniel B Jackson  
  
You make me think everything is ok  
Then you go out and play the field  
And make me play the fool  
  
Go and say that you're sorry  
I can't live on apologies  
If you want all my loving  
Then there will have to be some guarantees  
Say you'll settle down and in addition  
Say that you'll eliminate the competition  
  
Make up your mind what you want  
Nathaniel B Jackson  
  
This time I mean what I say  
Hey  
Nathaniel B Jackson

I said, hey hey hey, hey ya  
I said, hey, hey ya ya  
  
Well come on everybody  
Make a trip with me  
Down from Mississippi  
Down to New Orleans  
They got the honeysuckle  
Blooming on a honeysuckle vine  
Love is bloomin' there all the time  
Down from Mississippi  
Down to New Orleans  
  
You know that any Southern belle  
Is a Mississippi Queen  
  
Hey hey hey hey ya  
Hey hey ya ya  
  
Well come on everybody  
Take a stroll with me  
We gonna listen to the music  
With a Dixieland beat.  
They got the magnolia blossoms fill the air.  
If you ain't been to heaven  
You ain't been here  
Now all the French moss hangin'  
From a big oak tree.  
Down from Mississippi  
Down to New Orleans.  
  
Hey hey hey hey ya  
Hey hey ya ya  
  
Well let's go everybody  
Take a trip with me.  
Down from Mississippi  
Down to New Orleans.  
They got the honeysuckle  
Blooming on a honeysuckle vine.  
They got love bloomin' there all the time.  
You know that any Southern belle  
Is a Mississippi Queen.  
Down from Mississippi  
Down to New Orleans.  
  
Well, come on,  
You got it  
We gonna dance, going to New Orleans.  
That's the place  
I said, come on  
Come on, come on, come on

O holy night!  
The stars are brightly shining,  
It is the night  
Of the dear Saviour's birth  
Long lay the world  
In sin and error pining  
Till He appeared  
And the Soul felt its worth  
A thrill of hope  
The weary soul rejoices,  
For yonder breaks  
A new and glorious morn  
Fall on your knees!  
Oh, hear the angel voices!  
O night divine,  
O night when Christ was born  
O night, O holy night,  
O night divine!  
O night divine,  
O night when Christ was born  
O night,  
O holy night,  
O night divine!  
O night when Christ was born

Been away from you for much too long  
Been away but now I'm back where I belong  
Believed while I was gone away  
But I do just fine  
But I couldn't get the music of my mind  
And I couldn't leave the needing you behind  
  
Read the word from the page  
Free the bird from the cage  
Just go out there and face  
What you did, before  
Did it once  
You can do it once more  
Yeah  
  
[Chorus: ]  
Coming back for one more bite of the apple  
Tastes as sweet  
It's the nectar of life  
And you know that it's right  
'Cause you know you're not out there alone  
And that one more bite of the apple is all  
You gonna need to bring it home  
  
I couldn't count the chances that I've lost  
Couldn't count the chances or the cost  
But I can't help thinking about the days  
Of way back when  
And I know I wanna taste them once again  
Yes I know I wanna taste them once again  
  
Got some things to be said  
Going round in my head  
Time to get out of bed  
'Cause I've slept too long  
And I know there's a place I belong  
Yeah  
  
[Chorus: ]  
  
Was a time that I won't ever forget  
They were times that I will never regret  
I've been thinking about those days  
Since way back when  
And thinking I could bring back again  
Just maybe I could bring them back again  
  
One more dance in the night  
One more chance to get it right  
One more grab at the brass ring that's flying by  
One more toast to the mud in your eye  
Yeah  
  
[Chorus: ]  
  
I'll be back  
And sitting up high on the saddle  
All I want  
Is to do it once more  
Let me get through that door  
'Cause I still do believe that I can  
Want that one more bite of the apple  
And just a chance to taste it, once again  
  
Been around the world a time or two  
Everywhere I've been I thought of me and you  
I was hoping you'd remember how it used to be  
And maybe that you'd still remember me  
And that apple just as sweet as it could be  
Reach right up and pick one of that apple tree

Only you  
You and the night and the right kind of music  
And only you  
There's only you  
And only the moments that we've spent together will ever do  
And only me  
  
Me like the fool with his head in the cloud  
Could believe  
But I believe  
Dreams will come true  
With only you  
  
And so I dreamed  
I'll wait for the moment I'm praying and hoping that what I dreamed  
Will soon come true  
I'll have you forever and never be lonely again  
Not only friends, but lovers too  
With only you  
  
Me, I was that fool on the hill  
You know I will be waiting there still  
Hoping you'd come back again  
I heard your name  
Echoing soft through the trees  
I know it was calling to me  
And nothing could keep me away  
I only wanted to hold you  
And only you  
  
There's only you  
And only me  
Me like the fool with his head in the cloud  
Could believe  
But I believe  
Dreams will come true  
With only you  
  
Me, I was that fool on the hill  
You know I will be waiting there still  
Hoping you'd come back again  
I heard your name  
Echoing soft through the trees  
I know it was calling to me  
And nothing could keep me away  
I only wanted to hold you  
And only you  
  
You and the night and the right kind of music  
And only you  
Hey, there's only you  
Only you  
Hey, it's only you  
Only you
