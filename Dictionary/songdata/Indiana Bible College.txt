[Verse:]  
Because of love He left His throne and made this earth His home  
He did it willingly, for you and me, with heaven left behind  
He came to save all mankind, from sin and shame  
He could have walked away, but instead He chose to stay upon that tree  
And take a crown of thorns for me, because of love  
  
[Chorus:]  
Because of love He bore my pain, shouldering the blame  
Why did He choose to go, how could He love me so?  
Because of love He called to me, He said child I will set you free  
You will have life abundantly, because of love  
  
[Verse 2:]  
He gave unselfishly, caused my blinded eyes to see  
It was you and me He had in mind on the road to Calvary  
I never known such a perfect love I had fallen down but He picked me up  
He rescued my soul, now I want the world to know  
  
[Chorus 2:]  
Because of love He left the grave, prepared for us a place  
He'll back again someday and I will hear Him say  
Because you believed, you'll live eternally  
And I'll fall on my knees and I will cry

Verse 1  
Through her cries for mercy  
She heard their call for death  
She was pleading for her very life  
With every passing breath  
Though she knew that she was guilty  
And the price that she would pay  
But mercy knelt down from the throne  
And washed her guilt away  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Though the story's different  
My guilt was just the same  
For sin had brought it's burden  
And left it's filthy stain  
But in my cry for mercy  
Grace came down from the throne  
Telling me the price was paid  
And through His blood I've been atoned  
  
Chorus  
Now I've been washed  
In the blood  
I've been washed in the blood of the Lamb  
All my sin stains of scarlet are now white as snow

Verse 3  
Sometimes in human weakness  
My mind replays the past  
The pain and tears of yesteryears

And it seems I can't go on  
He reminds me of His precious blood  
That the stain of sin is gone

And by Your grace I will forgive  
And know that You are God  
And know that You are God  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Tag]  
You won't let go of me  
You won't let go, never let go  
  
You will take care of me  
You will take care, always take care  
  
Won't let go [3x]  
  
You hold my world in Your hands  
You hold my world  
And You won't let go

Verse 1  
Creation stands in awe of who You are  
The seas, the mountains  
The sun, the moon, the stars  
The trees wave their branches in adoration to Your name  
The cry of all creation is the same  
  
Chorus  
You're holy, Lord  
You're holy, Lord  
We worship You  
In one accord  
You're worthy to our praise afford  
For You are holy, Lord  
  
Verse 2  
No greater praise could ever be heard  
Than the cry of sins redeemed soul  
See I'm amazed by grace divine  
This praise I bring to You is mine  
No other name so worthy could I find  
  
Bridge  
The angels sit silent as we sing  
Lifting high the anthem of the redeemed  
Glory, honor, power, be unto Your majesty  
As we cry holy  
  
Ending  
Holy, Holy, Holy  
There is none beside thee  
For You are holy  
You are holy  
You are holy Lord, Lord, Lord  
Holy, Lord
