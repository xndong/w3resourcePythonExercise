The light shines down the valley  
The wind blows up the alley  
Oh how I wish I was lyin' in the arms of Mary  
  
She took the pains of boyhood  
And turned them into feel good  
Oh how I wish I was lyin' in the arms of Mary  
  
Mary was the girl who taught me all I had to know  
She out me right on my first mistake  
  
Summer wasn't gone  
when I learned all she had to give  
She really gave all a boy could take  
  
So now when I get lonely  
Still lookin for my one and only  
That's when I wish was lyin' in  
The Arms of Mary  
  
Mary was the girl who taught me all I had to know  
She out me right on my first mistake

Hello blue stranger, sittin' there all alone  
With your glass of sorrow, you seem so far from home  
Maybe you will let me, buy a round or two  
I'm a blue stranger too  
  
Well, hello blue stranger, I haven't seen your around  
But I know every reason, for leavin' town  
We might know each other, before the night is through  
I'm a blue stranger too  
  
And strangers fall in love, all the time  
All lovers were strangers once  
Just like us, a little unsure, chattin' out hi's  
  
Well, hello blue stranger, will you take a chance  
Well I might be mistaken, but I see meaning in your glance  
Maybe this could be the start of something new  
I'm a blue stranger too  
  
And strangers fall in love, everyday  
All lovers were strangers once  
Just like us, a little unsure of our little ways  
  
Well, hello blue stranger, sittin' there all alone  
With your glass of sorrow, you seem so far from home  
Maybe you will let me, buy you a round or two  
I'm a blue stranger too  
  
Hello blue stranger, Hello blue stranger  
Hello blue stranger.

[Verse 1]  
There'll be days your heart don't wanna beat  
You pray more than you breathe  
And you just wanna fall to pieces  
And nights, those 2 AM calls  
Where dreams become walls  
And you just need a break  
Break on me  
  
[Chorus]  
Shatter like glass  
Come apart in my hands  
Take as long as it takes, girl  
Break on me  
Put your head on my chest  
Let me help you forget  
When your heart needs to break  
Just break on me  
  
[Verse 2]  
There'll be times when someone you know  
Becomes someone you knew  
But you'd do anything to change it  
And words you wanna take back  
But you know you can't  
When the page just won't turn  
And it still hurts  
Break on me  
  
[Chorus]  
Shatter like glass  
Come apart in my hands  
Take as long as it takes, girl  
Break on me  
Put your head on my chest  
Let me help you forget  
When your heart needs to break  
Just break on me  
  
[Bridge]  
Oh, when you need somebody  
When you need somebody right now  
You're where I'll be  
Break on me  
  
[Chorus]  
Shatter like glass  
Come apart in my hands  
Take as long as it takes, girl  
Break on me  
Put your head on my chest  
Let me help you forget  
When your heart needs to break  
Just break on me  
Break on me  
Break on me, baby

I can hear the neighbors  
They're arguin' again  
And there hasn't been peace on our street  
Since who knows when  
I don't mean to listen in  
But the shoutin' is so loud  
I turn up the radio to drown it out  
And silently I say a little prayer  
  
But for the grace of God go I  
I must've been born a lucky guy  
Heaven only knows how I've been blessed  
With the gift of your love  
And I look around and all I see  
Is your happiness embracing me  
Oh Lord I'd be lost  
But for the grace of God  
  
I can see that old man  
He's walking past our door  
And I've been told that he's rich  
But he seems so poor  
'Cause no one comes to call on him  
And his phone it never rings  
He wanders through his empty home  
Surrounded by his things  
And silently I say a little prayer, yes I do  
  
But for the grace of God go I  
I must've been born a lucky guy  
Heaven only knows how I've been blessed  
With the gift of your love  
And I look around and all I see  
Is your happiness embracing me  
Oh Lord I'd be lost  
But for the grace of God  
  
I look around and all I see  
Is your happiness embracing me  
Oh Lord I'd be lost  
But for the grace of God  
Oh Lord I'd be lost  
But for the grace of God yeah  
  
Ooo ooo I'd be lost  
But for the grace of God, yeah  
Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo

If there's sand that you ain't wrote your name in  
If you're tired of the view from the same window  
If there's lips that you wanna get drunk on  
Ferris wheels that you need to get stuck on, go  
See everythin' you think you need to see  
Then come back to me  
  
If there's pavement you ain't put your shoes on  
If there's dance floors you ain't made a move on yet  
If you're feelin' too safe here beside me  
And you wanna do somethin' you might regret  
Try the whole world on if you feel the need  
Then come back to me  
  
[Chorus]  
I wouldn't want  
You to miss a thing  
I wouldn't wake  
You from any dream  
You ever have  
So, go on, and go, unroll every map  
But if you gotta leave  
You gotta know  
I love you enough  
To let you go  
If there's greener grass  
Hey, I wanna hold you, but I don't wanna hold you back  
  
If you fly like a bird in the Jetstream  
Hope the sky is a Hollywood set scene blue  
If you land with a tan and your shades on  
Hope the promise the postcard made comes true  
But if it ain't all that you dreamed it to be  
Come back to me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If you find someone else who deserves you  
Hope he loves you enough not to hurt you  
But if he does, you know right where I'll be  
Come back to me

We drove right past  
That no trespassing sign  
We sat on the tailgate  
And watched the planes take off  
  
We thought we had all night  
There was no need to rush  
That's when those cops  
Came pulling up  
And I thought  
Man, ain't this some shhhh  
  
Your daddy's gonna kill me  
But if I survive tonight  
I wouldn't change one thing  
Baby, yeah  
I know it sounds crazy  
  
But there was somethin bout the way  
The blue lights were shinin  
Bringing out the freedom in your eyes  
I was too busy watching you  
Going wild child  
To be worried about going to jail  
You were thinking that  
Running for it  
Would make a good story  
I was thinking you were crazy as hell  
And you were so  
Innocent  
But you were stealing my heart  
I fell in love in the back of a cop car  
  
Man, they weren't playin  
They sure threw those cuffs on quick  
You tried to sweet talk 'em  
They didn't fall for it  
But I did  
You were on the left  
I was on the right  
I knew you didn't smoke  
When you asked him for a light  
And I laughed  
He got mad and slammed the door  
  
Your daddy's gonna kill me  
But if I survive tonight  
I wouldn't change one thing  
Baby, yeah  
I know it sounds crazy  
  
But there was somethin bout the way  
The blue lights were shinin  
Bringing out the freedom in your eyes  
I was too busy watching you  
Going wild child  
To be worried about going to jail  
You were thinking that  
Running for it  
Would make a good story  
I was thinking you were crazy as hell  
And you were so  
Innocent  
But you were stealing my heart  
I fell in love in the back of a cop car  
  
Side by side  
And locked in tight  
They were taking their time  
But we didn't mind  
  
We talked  
And we laughed  
We sat real close  
By the time they let us go  
I was already gone  
  
But there was somethin bout the way  
The blue lights were shinin  
Bringing out the freedom in your eyes  
I was too busy watching you  
Going wild child  
To be worried about going to jail  
You were thinking that  
Running for it  
Would make a good story  
I was thinking you were crazy as hell  
And you were so  
Innocent  
But you were stealing my heart  
I fell in love in the back of a cop car

Soon the pines will be falling everywhere  
As the village children fight each other for their share  
And the six-o-nine goes roaring past the creek  
As Deacon Lee prepares his sermon for next week  
  
I saw Grandma yesterday down at the store  
Well she's really doing fine for eighty-four  
And she asked me if sometime I could fix her barn  
The poor old girl she needs a hand to run that farm  
  
[Chorus]  
And it's good old country comfort in my bones  
It's the sweetest sound these ears have ever known  
It's just an old-fashioned feeling fully-grown  
Country comfort and a truck that's goin' back home  
Oh it's goin' back home  
  
Down at the well they've got a new machine  
The foreman says it'll cut manpower by fifteen  
"Hey but that ain't natural" old Clay would say  
You see he's a horse-drawn man until his dying day  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Country comfort and a truck that's goin' back home  
Whoa, it's goin' back home  
Hey take me back home  
And a truck, and a truck that's goin' back home  
Any truck

Whoa!  
  
Oh yeah yeah  
  
I'm changing lanes and talkin' on the phone  
Drivin' way too fast.  
And the interstate's jammed with gunners like me  
Afraid of comin' in last.  
But somewhere in the race we run,  
We're coming undone  
  
[Chorus]  
And days go by,  
I can feel 'em flyin'  
Like a hand out the window in the wind.  
The cars go by,  
Yeah it's all we've been given,  
So you better start livin' right now  
'Cause days go by,  
Oh and a woo-hoo  
  
Out on the roof just the other night  
I watched the world flash by,  
Headlights, taillights,  
Running through a river of neon signs.  
But somewhere in the rush I felt,  
We're losing ourselves  
  
And days go by,  
I can feel 'em flyin'  
Like a hand out the window in the wind.  
The cars go by,  
Yeah it's all we've been given,  
So you better start livin' right now  
Days go by,  
Oh and a woo-hoo  
Yeah the days go by  
Oh and a woo-hoo  
  
We think about tomorrow then it slips away.  
Oh, yes, it does.  
We talk about forever but we've only got today  
  
And the days go by,  
I can feel 'em flyin'  
Like a hand out the window as the cars go by  
Yeah it's all we've been given,  
So you better start livin',  
You better start livin',  
Better start livin' right now!  
  
'Cause days go by,  
I can feel 'em flyin'  
Like a hand out the window in the wind.  
The cars go by,  
Yeah it's all we've been given,  
So you better start livin' right now  
'Cause days go by,  
Oh and a woo-hoo  
Yeah these days go by  
Oh and a woo-hoo  
  
Oh!  
So take 'em by the hand,  
They're yours and mine.  
Take 'em by the hand,  
And live your life.  
Take 'em by the hand,  
Don't let 'em all fly by!  
  
Come on, come on now,  
Yeah!  
Come on now!  
Oh and a woo-hoo!  
Don't you know the days go by

It's killin' me to write the word "goodbye"  
I've wadded up and tossed a thousand tries  
We both know the reason  
There ain't nothing to explain  
But I know that my leavin'  
Will spare us both the pain  
  
[Chorus]  
Desiree I can't hold you any longer  
Desiree you love his money more than me  
And the taxi's at the gate  
I guess all that's left to say  
Is in teardrops at the bottom of the page  
"I love you Desiree"  
  
It'd be easier to leave if I were mad  
But it's hard to lose the best you'll ever have  
And to write this note to you  
Was the hardest thing to do  
But not as hard as bein' a poor boy  
Who can't afford a girl like you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
God, I love you Desiree  
But I just can't take it anymore  
I won't be around for your goodbye  
I won't be around for your goodbye  
You love his money more than me  
I won't be around for your goodbye  
You love his money more than me  
I won't be around for your goodbye  
Oh you love his money, you love it more than me  
I was just a fool who couldn't see  
That you love his money, you love it more than me

Don't shut me out maybe baby  
We should talk about it  
'Cause you've got your doubts but maybe, baby  
They might be unfounded  
  
Have a little faith you'll make it through  
I'd never hesitate to talk to you  
If you tell me just what's weighing on your mind  
Maybe it could help you sleep tonight  
So don't shut me out  
  
Don't be so proud don't ya know that  
Before a fall it leaves ya  
And it'll take you down baby that ain't  
Where I want to see ya  
  
The sun'll rise tomorrow come what may  
And you'll feel better than you do today  
And in time you'll cry no more  
I know 'cause my heart's been there before  
  
And here I am when you need someone  
My shoulder's yours to cry upon  
And everybody now and then  
Needs and understanding friend around  
So don't shut me out  
  
Don't shut me out maybe baby  
We should talk about it  
'Cause you've got your doubts but maybe, baby  
They might be unfounded  
Listen to your heart and clear your mind  
And you will find the answer every time  
Every road you travel on will lead  
To where it is your heart's supposed to be  
  
And here I am when you need someone  
My shoulder is yours to cry upon  
And everybody now and then  
Needs an understandin' friend around  
So don't shut me out, don't shut me out, don't shut me out

I couldn't bring myself to take you home  
I've got you out here all alone  
And even this old drunken mind  
Still right here tonight  
  
Yellow fireflies in the field  
Think I know the way I feel  
At the corner of my eye  
Did you see that?  
  
[Chorus]  
Every star up in the sky  
Has got your name on it tonight  
And they don't stand a chance like I know I don't  
And girl you can't tell me that you can't see  
The kind of spell you put on me  
You gotta know just what you do  
Even the stars fall for you  
Even the stars fall for you  
  
So make a wish and make it fast  
I just want this thing to last  
'Cause heaven knows it's falling hard  
And I'm not the only one  
  
[Chorus]  
Every star up in the sky  
Has got your name on it tonight  
And they don't stand a chance like I know I don't  
And girl you can't tell me that you can't see  
The kind of spell you put on me  
You gotta know just what you do  
Even the stars fall for you  
  
I never counted on your touch  
Making me want you so much  
I never dreamed of your sweet lips  
Could make me feel like this  
Nothing like this  
  
[Chorus]  
Every star up in the sky  
Has got your name on it tonight  
And they don't stand a chance like I know I don't  
And girl you can't tell me that you can't see  
The kind of spell you put on me  
'Cause you gotta know just what you do  
Even the stars fall for you  
Even the stars fall for you  
Even the stars fall for you

Any time that you want what you need  
Close your eyes, say my name, call on me  
And I'll be there for you no matter what they say  
Rain, hail or shine  
I got my eye spy to the sky, waitin' on your sign  
  
Roll the dice, take a chance, a chance on me  
'Cause you never can tell where a little bit of faith might lead  
I got a you shaped hole inside  
I swear, it gets deeper by the day  
Flickin' cigarettes out the window, goin' no where in this lonely rain  
  
[Chorus]  
I need a faster car now  
A rocket ship straight to the moon  
I need a faster way to  
Show you how much I need you, baby  
  
It's a crime, it's a sin, it's a damn shame  
But you're the 'cause, and you're the cure of all my pain  
There's never been a bigger fool for you  
I can't believe my pride  
You got me talkin' to an empty pillow in the middle of the night  
I ain't slept in quite a while  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
I need a faster car now  
I'm a rocket man in love with you  
I need a faster way to  
Show you how much you drive me crazy  
Show you how much I need you, baby

Freedom's Finally Mine  
I'm on a red dirt road winding up to a sky of blue  
And I left the blacktop back about a mile or two  
No more sittin' at home leave the T.V. and the telephone far behind  
This life is killin' us all, back roads are lookin' mighty fine  
Oh, and  
  
[Chorus]  
Freedom's finally mine  
I ain't takin' anymore  
Yeah freedom's finally mine, It's finally mine  
I ain't takin' anymore  
Oh, freedom's finally mine  
  
I'd like to throw out this cellular  
And kick off these shop-shined shoes  
Leave the kids at your mama's  
And take off to Timbuktu  
So give me two sets of mud-grip tracks  
Leadin' off to way out back o' yonder  
There's no mountain I can't climb  
To satisfy this need of mine to wander  
Oh, 'cause...  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There's no desert I can't cross  
No river too wide  
I can do what I want now  
'Cause freedom's finally mine  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh freedom oh freedom It's finally mine, yeah it's mine  
It's finally mine, yeah it's mine

What kind of spell is this  
That you've cast on me with your kiss  
Its like I've lost all control of my senses  
Its just not like me, to give in so easily  
And drop my guard and leave my heart defenseless  
Oh, but I'm feelin' good here beneath the pines of the Georgia woods  
  
[Chorus]  
And what a surprise, here by your side  
Its more than a full moonshine and its driving me crazy  
I waited so long, for something this strong  
And now I gotta be fallin' 'cause I'm already callin' you baby  
  
There's nobody here to see  
These sparks between you and me  
We'd better be careful my love, or these woods will be burning  
Or maybe we just give in, throwing caution to the wind  
Its funny how we ain't got any say in the matter  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Uh huh  
Oh take me downtown  
Uh huh  
My sweet angel  
  
Yeah, I waited so long, somethin' is strong  
And I know I'm falling 'cause I'm already callin' you  
Oh  
  
What a surprise, hear by your side  
Its more than a full moonshine and its driving me crazy  
Oh waited so long, for something this strong  
And we know I'm fallin' 'cause I'm already callin' you  
Oh callin' you baby  
Yeah, uh huh

Down the drain pipe cross the yard and through the fence  
I risked a whoopin' every time I went  
'Cause white boys weren't allowed  
On the colored side of town  
But I was proud to call  
That old black man my friend  
He had a pillow by the bed he used to pray on  
And a beat up old guitar he let me play on  
I knew where my fingers went  
From his greasy fingerprints  
Yeah, he was passin' on  
What was handed down to him  
  
[Chorus]  
And it soaked up all the blood and sweat and teardrops  
And the beers he missed in smokey little bars  
And sometimes that old man he comes alive in my hands  
I feel the beating of his sad old broken heart  
Just like there's a ghost in this guitar  
A ghost in this guitar  
  
Well, the night before he died he made me take it  
He said, "You play it now, 'cause I gotta go"  
And I can feel him in my fingers when I play it  
'Cause sometimes I'm in control  
And sometimes I just sit back  
And let him go  
Sit back and let him go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Take a listen to the ghost in this guitar

It never ceases to blow my mind  
It does it to me every time  
Standin' here lookin' at you  
It makes me wonder what He was up to  
Was He thinking about me when He thought about you?  
  
[Chorus]  
When God made woman  
He must've been proud  
Yeah, he must've been crying or laughing out loud  
It must have felt like the first time  
Gettin' kissed by the sun  
When God made woman  
  
It must have been the most beautiful day  
Lookin' down on all creation  
He took a river that winds and turns  
Took a fire that breathes and burns  
And put it all in place  
In the most perfect way  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
God made woman

Well I can't believe I'm sittin' here today  
Picking on my banjo with a big smile on my face  
Writin' new words to an old school melody  
Hey there ain't no doubt that God's been good to me  
  
Oh the sun is shinin' on down in Tennessee  
And right now where I'm right where I want to be  
I've never felt so loved, so peaceful and so free  
Hey there ain't no doubt that God's been good to me  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause he put me smack dab in the middle of Paradise  
In the heart of the city where my dreams have come alive  
And everything I have, and everything I see  
Is just another reminder that God's been good to me  
  
This golden road's been long  
And sometimes I've lost my way  
I've been down some darkened detours  
Leanin' heavy on my faith  
But where the devil had me chained  
Lord your love done set me free  
Hallelujah! God's been good to me  
  
[Chorus: x2]

Mmm, just hold it now, let me put my drink down  
Baby, tell me are you really for real?  
Swingin side-to-side, doin that electric slide  
Spinnin' on your pretty little cowgirl boot heels  
And you're all alone and that ain't right  
A girl like you should have the best of everything  
Like someone to treat you right  
What I wouldn't give to hold you close  
Longer than tonight  
  
Cause I know a good thing when I see it  
And you got somethin' like I ain't never see before  
Yeah, I know a sweet dream when I dream it  
Just give me one chance and you'll never be lonely no more  
  
The possibilities, mmm, they're killin' me  
Like you're killin' every dude in the room with the way you move  
And you ain't slowin' down, my heads spinnin' round  
But this neon buzz is a-gettin' me up and I wanna get down with you  
  
Cause I know a good thing when I see it  
And you got somethin' like I ain't never see before  
Yeah, I know a sweet dream when I dream it  
Just give me one chance and you'll never be lonely no more  
  
Cause I know a good thing when I see it  
And you got somethin' like I ain't never see before  
Yeah, I know a sweet dream when I dream it  
If you let me be your man you'll never be lonely no more

I hit the highway and I checked the time  
I see the sunrise and it makes me want to change my mind  
Oh I got it bad  
I stopped for a coffee in a nowhere town  
A pretty waitress says "Hey what's the frown  
Boy you got it bad"  
Well so many times you told me before  
If you don't like it, well there's the door  
This time I've gone for good and I got it bad  
  
I got it badder than a broken heart  
Badder then the devil's smile  
And I can't face bein' apart  
I guess I'll have to leave but meanwhile  
Oh I got it bad  
  
Moonlight on the water still looks the same  
Pretty girl beside me but I don't know her name  
Guess I got it bad  
I'm too weak to say no, too lonely to care  
I'll believe her if she says hey baby  
I got to love to spare  
Well tomorrow I'll take it like a man  
Tonight I'm taking all I can  
This time I went for good and I got it bad  
  
I got it badder than a broken heart  
Badder then the devil's smile  
And I can't face bein' apart  
I guess I'll have to leave but meanwhile  
Oh I got it bad  
  
I got it badder than a broken heart  
Badder then the devil's smile  
And I can't face bein' apart  
I guess I'll have to leave but meanwhile  
Oh I got it bad  
  
I got it badder than a broken heart  
Badder then the devil's smile  
And I can't face bein' apart  
I guess I'll have to leave but meanwhile  
Oh I got it bad

I had a heck of a time gettin' into my house today  
There was a big ass you-Haul trailer in my way  
And she was headed for the car ...so I grabbed my old guitar  
I got one more chance before she drives away  
So  
  
[Chorus]  
Hank don't fail me now  
You've always bailed me out  
"Your Cheatin' Heart"  
Could set that suitcase down  
Give me one more song to whine  
That'll make her change her mind  
Cause she's walkin' out  
Hank don't fail me now  
  
Yeah she was throwin' stuff, cussin' like a sailor at me  
She was waving her arms around like she was fightin' bees  
If I could yodel her a lick  
That just might do the trick  
If I sang "I Saw The Light" would she believe  
(I don't think so)  
So  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
She's walkin' out  
Hank don't fail me now  
She's walkin' out  
Hank don't fail me now

I watched out the window  
As you drove away  
But we got so much history, baby  
Too much good love to throw away  
  
I know I can be a headstrong man  
Got a jealous streak a country mile wide  
Its just that I'm so damn scared of losing you  
As you're fading out of sight  
  
Ooh, ooh, I don't why I do this every time  
Ooh, ooh, run the other way from a heart like mine  
  
I'm doing the same things  
I saw my father do  
'Cause I was just a kid in the corner  
Watching words as they turned black and blue  
  
I'm the son of a son of a headstrong man  
So, defensive so full of foolish pride  
But I just will not lose you, baby  
And I'm starting to realize  
  
Ooh, ooh, I think I know why I do this every time  
Ooh, ooh, run the other way from a heart like mine  
  
I know the love that we got is good  
Can I be a better man, yeah, I know I could  
Standing here in the middle of this moonlit road  
I know just what I have to do  
  
Ooh, ooh, I'm runnin' to ya fast as I can tonight  
Ooh, ooh, gotta show you what its like, gotta show you what its like  
To be loved, so loved by a heart like mine  
Gonna wrap my arms around you as strong as young desire  
'Cause for you it's all beating in a heart like mine

Well, if you ever said goodbye I wouldn't waste all of my time cryin'  
I wouldn't sit home alone wonderin' where I went wrong  
I'd be rockin' on outta of here baby faster that a rollin' tear  
Ain't no grass gonna grow under me when you're gone  
No, I won't stay down for long  
  
I'd hit the ground, I'd hit the ground runnin'  
I know exactly what I'd do, honey  
I'd hit the ground, I'd hit the ground runnin'  
I'd hit the ground runnin' after you, yeah  
  
Gonna stop in long enough for a couple of things I gotta pick up  
Like some pretty red flowers and a store bought card  
That say what I really feel, that I'll need you and I always will  
And the three little words that used to come hard  
Then I'd jump in back in my car  
  
Then I'd hit the ground, I'd hit the ground runnin'  
I know exactly what I'd do, honey  
I'd hit the ground, I'd hit the ground runnin'  
I'd hit the ground runnin' after you, yeah  
  
There ain't no doubt, I ain't that proud  
There ain't no doubt about what I'd do  
I'd hit the ground, hit the ground  
I'd hit the ground runnin' after you, yes I would  
  
So if you gotta go baby I won't stop you  
And I won't sit around and miss you, no, no, no  
'Cause if you leave I'm comin' with you, yeah  
Comin' with you baby  
  
I'd hit the ground, I'd hit the ground runnin'  
I know exactly what I'd do, sugar  
I'd hit the ground, I'd hit the ground runnin'  
I'd hit the ground runnin' after you  
  
There ain't no doubt, I ain't that proud  
There ain't no doubt about what I'd do  
I'd hit the ground, I'd hit the ground  
I'd hit the ground runnin' after you

Monday morning, another workin' week ahead  
Friday seems so far away  
The clock keeps ringin', I gotta get up out of bed  
Maybe this could be the day  
Motivation, well it keeps you holdin' on  
Every step of the way  
Headin' in the right direction when you think you're turnin' wrong  
Lookin' out for when you stray  
So hear what I say  
There's no other way, you gotta  
  
[Chorus]  
Hold onto your dreams  
'Cause someday baby  
Your ship is gonna come in, so  
Hold onto your dreams  
'Cause everything ya see  
Comes true if you believe in holdin'  
On to your dreams  
  
Well I know sometimes it's hard to see the light  
Shinin' at the tunnel's end  
And though the road just goes on and on for miles  
Faith lives just around the bend  
So now and then, remember  
  
Hold onto your dreams  
'Cause someday baby  
Your ship is gonna come in, so  
Hold onto your dreams  
And everything ya see  
Comes true if you believe in holdin'  
On to your dreams  
  
Just like your eyes are the window to the soul  
Dreams are the highway that lead to your goal  
Hold on, hold on  
You've got to hold on  
Hold on  
  
(Oh, you just got to hold on)  
  
Hold onto your dreams  
'Cause someday baby  
Your ship is gonna come in, so  
Hold onto your dreams  
'Cause someday baby,  
Your ship is gonna come in, so  
Hold onto your dreams,  
'Cause someday baby,  
Your ship is gonna come in, so  
Hold onto your dreams  
'Cause everything ya see,  
Comes true if you believe  
In holding on to your dreams.

You spun your web back a Sunday or two  
I ain't never met nobody  
Like the likes of you  
You got me preachin' the news  
You turned down my road and decided to stay  
And I took a shine to your hair  
And your hillbillly ways  
And how you kiss on my face  
I got a bone deep feelin'  
You're the start of the good ole days  
  
[Chorus]  
Well I still remember  
You came by my trailer  
With chicken and some homemade wine  
The dogs got to barkin'  
When we got the sparkin'  
We almost set the house on fire  
Well I got a big heapin' helpin'  
Of the stuff I get a hankerin' for  
But honey your homespun love  
Just keeps me comin' back for more  
  
I like the flamingos you stuck in your yard  
And I like the notions you stick in my head and my heart  
Yeah and how you fix on my car  
Well I reckon I'm lucky you're everything I need so far  
  
[Chorus]

Time stands still for no one  
I know this is true  
I've been stuck here waiting  
Then along came you  
And you gave me back  
The love I had  
The faith I'd lost  
The life I knew  
  
[Chorus]  
I wanna thank you for the love that you give me  
And the sun that you put in my sky  
You don't know how much you've lifted me up  
But I feel so alive  
That I could fly  
I could fly, oh  
  
There's no way I could've made it this far  
Without you  
You came to me just when I needed someone to believe  
That I could make it through  
And you gave me back  
The love I had  
The faith I'd lost  
The life I knew  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Above the clouds  
Fly so high, never come down  
Just you and I, I'm so in love  
With you, with you  
And you gave me back  
The love I had  
The faith I'd lost  
The life I knew  
  
I wanna thank you for the love that you give me  
And the sun that you put in my sky  
You don't know how much you've lifted me up  
But I feel so alive  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And I could fly, I could fly, oh  
I wanna spread my wings  
Let me tell you  
Said I need your love, I need your love  
Stay with me baby  
Oh, I need your love, and I need your love  
Stay with me baby  
Oh, I need your love, I need your love  
Stay with me baby  
Yeah I need your love, and I need your love  
Stay with me honey baby, c'mon now stay  
C'mon now, yeah  
  
You and me side by side walkin' through the woods in the pale moonlight  
Oh yeah now and it feels so good

As I turn out the light and bow my head to pray  
The answered prayer I'm thankful for  
Is I made it through today  
  
Well her leavin' took it's toll on me  
And it took a lot of faith  
To find the strength to carry on  
But I made it through today  
  
Oh I was guilty of takin' her heart for granted  
Lettin' love slip through my hands  
'Til I was empty-handed  
And now I know how much I have and I ain't gonna lose it  
'Cause I've been given a second chance  
And I intend to use it  
  
I'm not tryin' to change the world  
I'm just tryin' to find my way  
And I still stumble now and then  
But I made it through today  
  
Whoa I was guilty of takin' this life for granted  
Lettin' time slip through my hands  
'Til I was empty-handed  
Now I know how much I have and I ain't gonna lose it  
'Cause I've been given a second chance  
And I intend to use it  
  
As I turn out the light and bow my head to pray  
The answered prayer I'm thankful for  
Is I made it through today  
Mmm-mmm I made it through today  
Mmm-mmm I made it through today  
Mm-hmm mm-hmm

I thought You knew, guess I assumed to much  
I don't know how, but now where so far out of touch  
And I never planned, to so miss understand  
But what you needed, you never asked me to give  
And I swear as I live  
  
I thought you knew my heart was yours  
And that we were so together  
That we, would always be  
I don't believe, you leavin' me is the answer  
  
I'm not askin' you to let me rush back in and fail again  
I'm askin' for one chance, not to assume  
So I can say and do all the things I thought you knew  
  
So far where still so far  
From where we know we should be  
I'm searching for words  
And you haven't heard  
  
I thought you knew my heart was yours  
And that we were so together  
That we, would always be  
I don't believe, you leavin' me is the answer  
  
I'm not askin' you to let me rush back in and fail again  
I'm askin' for one chance, not to assume  
So I can say and do all the things I thought you knew  
  
I thought you knew  
  
Oh god I thought you knew!

You said you needed your space  
I wasn't where you wanted to be  
I didn't stand in your way  
I only want you to be happy  
And, so, how surprised am I to see you here tonight?  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, can't you see  
That for worse or for better we're better together?  
Please just come back home  
No, don't say that you're sorry  
And I won't say I told you so  
  
Sometimes in our life  
We get to where we wonder if  
The long road that we're on  
Is headin' in the same direction  
Well, when it comes to you and me  
We're right where I know we should be  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Sometimes it's like we're deep in nothing but love  
The slightest thing can grow so foolishly  
Remind me, please  
Oh, can't you see  
That for worse or for better we're better together?  
Please just come back home  
No, don't say that you're sorry  
You don't gotta say you're sorry, baby  
Oh, can't you see  
That for worse or for better we're better together?  
Please just come back home  
No, don't say that you're sorry  
And I won't say I told you so  
And I won't say I told you so  
But I told you so  
Should've known better than to leave me, baby

[Chorus]  
You're such a pretty little thing  
I want to put a wedding ring on your finger  
Baby can't you see that we were meant to be together  
Yeah the joinin' of our hearts is written in the stars  
We've got a love made in heaven  
So baby take my hand I want to be your man forever  
  
Well I can't think of anyone else it's true  
All day long there's no one on my mind but you  
And I have loved you since you were a little girl  
You mean everything to me and you're all I'll ever need in this world  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Every time I look into your eyes I see  
The one I want beside me for eternity  
You could make me the happiest man alive  
By settin' up a date and takin' my name for life  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Baby take my hand I want to be your man forever

I used to cry out in the middle of the night  
Baby hold me tight  
But there was no one beside me when I opened my eyes  
Now I turn the corner of those days and nights  
Something inside me changed and I think I might  
Be starting over  
I don't wanna run  
Oh no, cause you might be the one, baby  
  
[Chorus]  
If ever I could love  
I think it could be with you  
If ever thought I found somebody so true  
I wonder if you feel  
The same way that I do  
If ever I could love  
I think it could be with you  
  
You know I can't read your mind love  
But it seems to me  
That your heart and mine tonight are  
Defying gravity  
There's something so familiar  
And still so unknown  
The closer we get I swear it feels like coming home  
And I'm ready to be brave  
Oh yea and you look at me say  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If ever I could love  
If ever I could love  
If ever I could love  
If ever I could be  
If ever I could love  
Oh yeah no way  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I was scared to love again  
Till the day that came  
When she walked out of my life  
I got hurt so bad  
I swear I'd never let another inside this heart of mine  
But you touch my hand and every plan that I had  
Disappeared like a fallen star  
There's a new beginning and I'm moving to the rhythm  
Of a beating braver heart  
A braver heart  
If ever I could love, oh oh  
If ever I could love, yea yea

Go if you wanna go, stay if you wanna stay  
My hearts not a game you can play with and out away  
Baby tryin' to figure you out, could make a man go insane  
So just go if you wanna go, stay if you wanna stay  
  
Dream what you want to dream, be who you gotta be  
I never wanna be the one who kept you from being free  
But girl I gotta know what you want, 'cause I've takin' all I can take  
So just go if you wanna go, stay if you wanna stay  
  
Every time you decide, to spread your wings and fly  
You make the same mistake, and I can't take anymore goodbyes  
So baby just go if you wanna go, stay if you wanna stay  
  
Every time you decide, to spread your wings and fly  
You make the same mistake, and I can't take anymore goodbyes  
So baby just go if you wanna go, stay if you wanna stay  
  
I don't wanna lose everything our love has made  
But I don't wanna feel alone every time you go away  
So just go if you wanna go, stay if you wanna stay  
  
Baby just go if you wanna go, stay if you wanna stay

Love doesn't come with a contract  
You give me this I give you that  
And it's scary business  
Your heart and soul is on the line  
Baby why else would I be standing 'round here so tongue-tied  
  
[Chorus]  
If I knew what I was doing, I'd be doing it right now  
I would be the best damn poet  
Silver words out of my mouth  
Well my words might not be magic  
But they cut straight to the truth  
So if you need a lover and a friend  
Baby I'm in, I'm in  
  
Baby come on in the water's fine  
I'll be right here you take your time  
Just let me hold you and we'll both take that leap of faith  
It's like I told you there's no guarantees when you feel this way  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Baby I'm in, and I'm in  
  
Baby come here next to me I'll show you how good it can be  
I'll breathe each breath you breathe I can pour out everything I am  
Everything thing I am  
  
Oh, and if I knew what I was doing I'd be doing it right now  
I would be the best damn poet silver words out of my mouth  
Well my words might not be magic  
But they cut straight to the truth  
So if you need a lover and a friend, yeah  
If you need a lover and a friend  
Oh baby I'm in, and I'm in,  
Baby I'm in, and I'm in  
  
Baby come here next to me I'll show you how good it can be  
I'll breathe each breath you breathe I can pour out everything I am  
And baby come here next to me I'll show you how good it can be  
And baby come here next to me I'll show you how good it can be  
Baby come here, baby come here, baby come here.

Yeah, yeah  
Oh it's a love thing  
  
I been working all day long  
And I'm ready to come on home to you, mm mm  
All the other guys roll their eyes  
And don't realize it's what I want to do  
It's what I want to do  
They say I'm wrapped around your finger  
But they don't understand  
That what we got is more than just a diamond  
On your hand  
  
Baby it's a love thing, whoa  
Baby it's a love thing, yeah  
  
Sure I could hang around and complain about  
The way things ought to be  
Yeah there's trouble in the world  
But you're the girl  
Whose open arms are all I really need  
And that's why I come runnin'  
To be there by your side  
To let 'em call me crazy  
But it can't be denied  
  
Baby it's a love thing, whoa  
Ah baby it's a love thing, yeah  
  
And it's not about the same last name  
It's not a thing that can be explained  
It's how you make me feel inside  
And the way you hold me every night  
  
It's a love thing, whoa  
Oh baby, it's a love thing, yeah  
  
Here we go now  
It's a love thing  
  
They say I'm wrapped around your finger  
But they don't understand  
That what we got is more than just a diamond  
On your hand  
Baby it's a love thing, whoa  
Oh baby it's a love thing, yeah  
Come on it's a love thing, whoa  
Oh baby, It's a love thing, yeah  
Oh, it's a love thing, whoa  
Oh sugar, it's a love thing  
No it ain't about no diamond ring  
It's a love thing, whoa  
Oh baby it's a love thing,  
It's a love, it's a love, it's a love thing

I can't sleep, ain't no sleep a'coming  
I'm just lying here thinking 'bout you  
I'm in deep, falling deep into the picture  
In my mind of everything we're gonna do  
  
Over at the lake and down by the river  
You can feel it start to rise  
Wanna jump in my car, go wherever you are  
'Cause I need you by my side  
  
[Chorus]  
It's gonna be a long, hot summer, we should be together  
With your feet up on the dashboard now  
Singing along with the radio, it's such a beautiful sound  
But when you say my name in the middle of the day,  
I swear I see the stars come out  
When you hold my hand in the back of my mind,  
Just waiting on the sun to go down, the sun to go down  
  
I wanna see your brown skin shimmer in the sun for the first time  
I try to be the one who knows just what to do to you to get me that smile  
One chance of meeting, you were walking by me on the street and I said hi  
And that was the beginning of my heart spinnin' like these wheels in my head
tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The only place that I wanna be is where you are  
'Cause anymore than a heartbeat away is just too far  
  
It's gonna be a long, hot summer, we should be together  
All I really want is more than this moment right now  
'Cause when you say my name in the middle of the day,  
I swear I see the stars come out  
And when you hold my hand and I look into your eyes  
Oh I swear it looks like you're waiting on the sun to go down, the sun to go
down  
  
I swear it's like you're waiting on the sun to go down  
Waiting on the sun to go down  
Hey, yeah oh, I'm loving thinking 'bout you  
I can't sleep, I'm just lying here thinkin' 'bout you

We've spent a long time side by side  
Guess I've loved your forever  
Sometimes we laughed, sometimes we cried  
Still we made it together  
I don't know what I'd do without you  
Girl you make me smile  
You know I can't stop thinkin' about you  
Oh you drive me wild  
  
[Chorus]  
Baby our love is still comin' on strong  
You give me strength that I needed so long  
I can't explain how I feel in my heart  
But the love we got goin' will never fall apart  
  
Now here you are still in my arms  
After so many years have gone  
It seems we both were meant to be  
Now that all of the tears have gone  
And when it's time to settle down  
And get ourselves a home  
I'll be beside you all the way  
Never again will you be alone  
  
[Chorus]

You're pretty as a daisy in an open field  
The way you make me feel from the get-go  
I had to let go of every little thing that Ive ever known  
You shake me up like Coke in a bottle  
You're a pedal to the floor, full throttle  
Ain't nothin' else on my mind when I see that pretty smile  
Go on  
  
Show me how it's done this side of Dixie  
I'm a broke down truck, baby, won't you fix me  
Just keep on dancin' til the break of dawn, come on, come on  
Stars fall down, make the world stop, kiss me  
Wherever I go, I want you with me  
Somethin' bout you makes my heart run wild  
You're love's poster child  
  
Damn girl, you make me feel so free  
Like a summer sun shining down on me  
And we're flying so high and good Lord we ain't even trying  
You got a hold on me now, like a southern wind  
Taking me places Ive never been  
And I'm lost in your eyes and come on darling, do it again  
  
Show me how it's done this side of Dixie  
I'm a broke down truck, baby, won't you fix me  
Just keep on dancin' til the break of dawn, come on, come on  
Stars fall down, make the world stop, kiss me  
Wherever I go, I want you with me  
Somethin' bout you makes my heart run wild  
You're love's poster child  
  
Show me how it's done this side of Dixie  
I'm a broke down truck, baby, won't you fix me  
Just keep on dancin' til the break of dawn, come on, come on  
Stars fall down, make the world stop, kiss me  
Wherever I go, I want you with me  
Somethin' bout you makes my heart run wild  
You're love's poster child

I can't believe it, guess I'll never understand  
Seems to me, I'm lookin' at someone who's  
an unchanged man  
Tell me, what've I gotta do  
To make you see that she's always loved you  
Right there waitin' in the wings  
Unaware of the foolish things you do, think about it  
  
[Chorus]  
She would never do a thing to hurt you  
And there is nothing she'd ever need to hide  
You're takin everything she gives for granted  
You got it all and still I don't know why  
You're lovin' on the side  
  
If somebody told her 'bout your secret ways  
Do you think you'd ever find another  
who could take her place  
I'd give everything I own  
Just to have what you got at home  
But still you are never satisfied  
Why do you keep lovin' on the side when you know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Tell me what I've gotta do  
To make you see that she always loved you  
Right there waitin' in the wings  
Unaware of the foolish things you do,  
well think about it  
You're lovin' on the side  
Lovin' on the side  
  
[Chorus]

Well I ain't proud of what I'm about to do  
All alone up here with you  
With the picture of your man  
Face down upon the night stand, so he can't see  
And I don't like running all the red lights here  
Every time the coast is clear  
Any time you need my lovin'  
You know I'll come running, faithfully  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause he stays so busy with his money  
And you, you get so lonely when he's gone  
And me, I'm just your temporary lover  
'Til your blues are gone  
I'm the man of the house whenever he ain't home  
  
Now the statues on the side of that big gate  
They're laughing as I drive away  
And I can't keep from thinking  
Are they laughing at your old man or at me  
And the only part that I don't like to play  
Is the part when I get up and go away  
I find it mighty hard  
Just keeping this old heart tucked away  
Cause he stays  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm the man of the house  
When your other man ain't home

I thought I was doing all right being alone  
I swore I'd never let somebody get close again  
I was never gonna let my guard down, not for anyone  
But there's a light in your eyes and it's got me moving' in  
And tonight these walls are all coming down  
  
And my heart is open  
I'm lettin' you in  
'Cause you give me a reason and the faith I've been needing to start again  
And your love is healing  
I'm finally breathing  
And I've been waiting so long hoping for this moment  
My heart is open  
  
These days it seems like everybody's just walking away  
Like there's no forever and love is just a game  
But don't you know that you can believe me when I say that I'm your man  
  
And my heart is open  
I'm lettin' you in, baby  
'Cause you give me a reason and the faith I've been needing to start again  
And your love is healing  
I'm finally breathing  
I've been waiting so long hoping for this moment  
My heart is open  
  
I can't wait anymore, no no  
Because I've got nothing left to prove  
And I've got so much love for you  
That's why I'm tearing out the walls, and baby I'm kicking down the doors  
  
And your love is healing  
Baby, I'm finally breathing  
And I can hear you calling, I'm ready to fall in love again  
My heart is open  
  
Yeah, my heart is open  
Oh, baby  
My heart is open.  
Oh, yeah,  
Oh, yeah.

You brought that bottle home in a paper sack  
Drew the blinds and locked the doors  
And there's nothing but empty there inside that glass  
So you pour a little more  
And there's no one there to judge you  
At least that's what you tell yourself, but  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't you know  
Nobody drinks alone  
Every demon, every ghost  
From your past  
And every memory you've held back  
Follows you home  
Nobody drinks alone  
  
You remember whiskey on your daddy's breath  
So you always stick to wine  
And you scared your little brother half to death  
You just kept it all inside  
You can hear your mama cryin'  
Only now she cries for you, and  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Though you're only  
Hey don't you let that feelin' fool ya  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Nobody drinks alone

This is my one chord song  
It's easy to sing along  
'Cause there ain't much in the way it changes  
But sometimes life can be that way.  
  
Yeah, there aint to much  
That I can do with the melody  
'Cause I'm stuck within the confines  
Of the single key of G.  
  
This is my one chord song  
I can't go on too long  
'Cause I've said all I've got to say  
And you probably won't hear this anyway.  
  
Yeah, now here's the same thing  
That you heard 8 bars before  
And if your just like me  
I'm sure that you are bored with this chord.  
  
But if I can make you stop and think  
About the life your living in  
'Cause you and I, we dont have long  
So make the most before it's gone.  
  
'Cause this is my one chord song.  
  
Now I can make it sound  
Like there's another chord  
But you'd be fooled  
'Cause there is only one.  
  
This is my one chord song.  
This is my one chord song.  
  
This is my one chord song...

I've been through ups and downs  
I haven't known which way to turn  
And when I wander through this town  
I only think of you  
  
Only you, can take my bad heart and make it good  
Only you, can take my crooked path and make it new  
  
On the day that I was born  
The cards were dealt, the dice were thrown  
I think my destiny was drawn  
I can only be with you  
  
Only you, can take my bad heart and make it good  
Only you, can take my crooked path and make it new  
  
Only you, can take my bad heart and make it good  
Only you, can take my crooked path and make it new  
  
In My heart is only you.  
  
And my soul is all there too  
  
I built myself a prison cell  
The walls are painted blue  
Only you can let me out  
Only you  
  
Only you, can take my bad heart and make it good  
Only you, can take my crooked path and make it new  
  
Only you, can take my bad heart and make it good, girl  
Only you, can take my crooked path and make it new  
  
Only you, can take my bad heart and make it good  
Only you, can take my crooked path and make it new  
  
Only you, only you

Well I know there's a reason  
And I know there's a rhyme  
We were meant to be together  
And that's why,  
We can roll with the punches  
We can stroll hand in hand  
And when I say it's forever  
You understand  
  
[Chorus]  
That you're always in my heart,  
You're always on my mind  
But when it all becomes too much,  
You're never far behind  
And there's no one that comes close to you  
Could ever take your place  
'Cause only you can love me this way  
  
I could have turned a different corner  
I could have gone another place  
Then I'd of never had this feeling  
That I feel today, yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh  
  
Only you can love me this way.

Well here you come again and you're lookin' so fine  
You don't notice me but it's alright  
I'm just a guy who wishes that I could be your man someday  
Yeah a picture paints a thousand words it's true  
But it's still not enough for how I feel about you  
I wanna put you in a melody, I gotta set you to a groove  
  
I wanna put you in my car and drive  
And turn you up loud, roll down all the windows and shout it out  
I love this girl oh  
If I could press play, repeat, how happy I'd be  
Wherever I'd go I'd have you there with me  
You'd be right where you belong  
I wanna put you in a song, oh oh oh  
  
Well I'd sing about your smile and your pretty blue eyes  
The way your hair shimmers in the sunlight  
It'd be so easy I'll just write it from my heart  
'Cause I gotta tell the world what you mean to me  
Wrap you up in a melody so you'll be  
Stuck in my head all day  
'Cause you're already there anyway, yes you are  
  
I wanna put you in my car and drive  
And turn you up loud, roll down all the windows and shout it out  
I love this girl  
If I could press play, repeat, how happy I'd be  
Wherever I'd go I'd have you there with me  
You'd be right where you belong  
I wanna put you in a song  
  
And if I get it right everybody will be singing along yeah  
And when they see you on the street they'll say  
Hey ain't you the girl in that song  
  
I wanna put you in my car and drive  
And turn you up loud, roll down all the windows and shout it out  
I'm in love with this girl  
Yeah if I could press play, rewind a couple million times  
Imagine for a moment that you're all mine  
Every night I'd drive you home  
If I could put you in a  
Let me put you in a song  
Let me put you in a song  
Oh a pretty little song about you baby

It ticks just like a Timex  
It never lets up on you  
Who said life was easy?  
The job is never through  
  
It'll run us till we're ragged  
It'll harden our hearts  
And love could use a day of rest  
Before we both start falling apart  
  
[Chorus]  
Pray that it's raining on Sunday  
Storming like crazy  
We'll hide under the covers all afternoon  
Baby whatever comes Monday  
Can take care of itself  
'Cause we've got better things  
That we can do  
When it's raining on Sunday  
  
Your love is like religion  
A cross in Mexico  
And your kiss is like the innocence  
Of a prayer nailed to a door  
  
Oh surrender is much sweeter  
When we both let it go  
Let the water wash our bodies clean  
And love wash our souls  
  
And pray that it's raining on Sunday  
Storming like crazy  
And we'll hide under the covers all afternoon  
And baby whatever comes Monday  
Can take care of itself  
'Cause we've got better things  
That we can do  
When it's raining on Sunday  
  
Pray that it's raining on Sunday  
Storming like crazy  
We'll hide under the covers all afternoon  
Baby whatever comes Monday  
Can take care of itself  
'Cause we got better things  
That we can do  
When it's raining on Sunday  
When it's raining on Sunday  
When it's raining on Sunday  
Let it rain

Raise 'em up  
I'm talkin' 'bout a lighter on a Saturday night  
The band plays a song you like and you sing along  
  
Raise em up  
I'm talkin' 'bout Daddy's old pickup truck  
Shotgun seat, there's the one you love and you're kissin' on  
  
Get those white sails sailing down in Mexico  
Its just a whiskey glass if you ain't makin' a toast  
Lift your tear-filled eyes up to the sky  
A comin' home, you've been gone too long  
Tonight were gonna  
Raise 'em up  
  
Raise 'em up  
You got a voice, you got a choice  
Go make some noise  
Don't ever let 'em tell you who you are  
Raise 'em up  
Fist black and blue, fight for the truth  
Its what you do  
Hand on your heart for the stripes and stars  
  
Black umbrellas in the pourin' rain  
A Sunday Morning Coming Down, Amazing Grace  
Lift those tear-filled eyes up to the sky  
As the flag flies, say goodbye  
Tonight were gonna  
Raise 'em up  
  
So, you meet someone  
The only one  
You take her by the hand  
Make a stand  
Buy some land  
Make some love  
And them babies come  
  
Raise 'em up  
Raise 'em up  
Raise 'em up trophy high  
Raise 'em up to the sky  
Raise 'em up, show everybody that newborn smile  
Raise 'em up tall and strong  
Raise 'em up right from wrong  
Raise 'em up so damn high they can hear God singing along  
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah  
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah  
Woah, woah, woah, woah

I'm a lucky man, yes, I am  
Living in Heaven down here on earth  
Her Tennessee smile drives me wild  
Don't you know, I know what its worth  
Shes every little thing in life that makes me feel good  
  
[Chorus]  
Shes my radio turned up to 11  
Shes my country song that I just gotta sing along to  
So fine, so fine, like the finest wine  
Shes my blue-eyed dream, my summer queen  
I cant believe shes mine, all mine  
Mine, all mine, all mine  
Mine, all mine, all mine  
  
That cool breeze kiss from her lips  
Is what I'm missing when I'm gone  
To tell the truth my heart's shot through  
When it comes to love, she can do no wrong  
Shes every little thing in life that makes me feel so good  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Whoa, oh, whoa, oh, oh  
She got my heart skippin a beat  
Whoa, oh, whoa, oh, oh  
She got me dancin in the street  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Mine, all mine, all mine

Winter's weighin' on your shoulders  
It's hangin around a little too long  
And I can see it in your eyes  
You've taken on a load that's just too strong  
Oh, but let me get down to the heart of the matter  
Baby, if you want, I can make it better now  
  
[Chorus]  
When the sun is hard to find  
When it's rainin' in your eyes  
When the shadows block those pretty, little, blue skies living inside you  
When the fallin' of your tears makes a candle disappear  
When you just can't see the light  
Baby, I'll find a way to shine  
I'll find a way to shine  
  
Everybody's got a cross to carry  
Everybody's got a story they can tell  
Ya know you're not the only one counting on a quarter and wishin' well  
Whoa, don't you sit there with your heart under lock and key  
Gimmie one chance, baby, I can set you free  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Sometimes in this life, good luck don't shine like it suppose to do  
When there's no one you can trust  
And they just keep on givin' up on you  
Baby, don't ya know that I won't ever let ya down  
Come on now, woo  
  
Oh, don't sit there with your heart under lock and key  
Just gimmie one chance, and, baby, I can set you free  
  
When the sun is hard to find  
When it's rainin' in your eyes  
When the shadows block those pretty, little, blue skies living inside you  
When the fallin' of your tears makes a candle disappear  
When you just can't see the light  
Baby, I'll find a way to shine  
I'll find a way to shine  
Find a way to shine  
Find a way to shine  
You know I'll find a way  
  
Find a way  
Find a way  
  
Find a way to shine

It was about five til' five on Friday  
We were all getting ready to go  
And the boss man started screaming  
And his veins began to show  
He said "You and you come with me  
'Cause you're gonna have to stay"  
My heart was thumping I was jumping  
I had to get away  
  
[Chorus]  
Some days you gotta dance  
Live it up when you get the chacne  
When the world doesn't make no sense  
And you're feeling just a little too tense  
Gotta loosen up those chains and dance  
  
Well I was talking with my baby  
Over a small glass of tea  
When she asked a loaded question  
She said "How do you feel about me?"  
My mind was racin' I was pacin'  
But the words just would'nt come  
And there was only one thing left to do  
I feel it coming on  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Some days you gotta dance  
You gotta loosen up those chains and dance  
You gotta loosen up those chains and dance

There's a new wind blowing like I've never known  
I'm breathing deeper than I've even done  
And it sure feels good to finally feel the way I do  
And I want to love somebody, love somebody like you  
  
And I let go of all my lonely yesterdays  
I've forgiven myself for the mistakes I've made  
Now there's just one thing the only thing I want to do  
I want to love somebody, love somebody like you  
  
[Chorus]  
Yeah I want to feel the sunshine  
Shining down on me and you  
When you put your arms around me  
You let me know there's nothing in this world I can't do  
  
I used to run in circles going nowhere fast  
I'd take one step forward and took two steps back  
I couldn't walk a straight line even if I wanted to  
I want to love somebody, love somebody like you  
  
Oh here we go now, ooo, yeah,  
Hey I want to love ya baby,  
Oh oh, oh oh  
  
Yea I want to feel the sunshine  
Shining down on me and you  
When you put your arms around me  
Well baby there ain't nothing in this world I can't do  
  
Sometime it's hard for me to understand  
But your teaching me to be a better man  
I don't want to take this life for granted like I used to do, no no  
I want to love somebody, love somebody like you  
  
I'm ready to love somebody, love somebody like you  
I want to love somebody, love somebody like you  
  
Hey I want to love ya baby, ah uh  
  
I want to be the man in the middle of the night shining like it's true  
I wanna to be the man that you run to whenever I call on you  
When everything that loved someone finally found it's way  
I wanna be a better man I can see it in you yeah  
  
Hey I want to love you baby  
  
Ah ah yeah, na na na na na

Somewhere tonight, there's somebody cryin'  
And feelin' completely alone  
Somewhere tonight, there's somebody tryin'  
To find a way back home  
  
Mmm-mm I don't know why  
Mmm-mm but sometimes angels can't fly  
  
How many times have you judged a stranger  
Shakin' your head in shame  
And wondered how could they fall so far  
Well maybe they're not to blame  
  
Mmm-mm I don't know why  
Mmm-mm but sometimes angels can't fly  
  
They've got their wings and they've got their will  
There's blue sky all around  
But sometimes it seems that we're destined to be  
Forever on the ground  
  
I don't know why, no  
  
Look at us runnin' around in circles  
Chasin' our peace of mind  
Searchin' in vain for our wayward halos  
That some of us never find  
  
Mmm-mm I don't know why  
Mmm-mm sometimes angels can't fly  
Mmm and I don't know why  
Mmm sometimes angels can't fly  
Mmm

I'm driving home tonight, catching all red lights  
That's alright cause I don't want to be alone  
There's nobody waitin' there, cold and empty bed  
Words I wished Id said come on the radio  
  
Ooh, oh, oh, and I don't know why I do this to myself  
Ooh, oh, oh, I know you're with someone else  
  
But in my mind were somewhere in my car  
And it's raining hard on the streetlight glow  
You got your lips on mine, its gasoline on fire  
I never will forget, you grabbed my shirt and pulled it over my head  
And your fingertips slide up and down my back  
Breathin' hard, steamin' up the glass  
Id give anything if I could bring you back home  
  
So, I've been sleeping til noon in the same bedroom  
Where I once held you and its breaking my heart  
I should take down all those pictures from my wall  
Promises we made won't fill this empty space  
  
Ooh, oh, oh, and I dont know why I just cant let you go  
Ooh, oh, oh, I know youre never coming back  
  
But in my mind were somewhere in my car  
And it's raining hard on the streetlight glow  
You got your lips on mine, its gasoline on fire  
I never will forget, you grabbed my shirt and pulled it over my head  
And your fingertips slide up and down my back  
Breathin' hard, steamin' up the glass  
Id give anything if I could bring you back home  
  
But in my mind were somewhere in my car  
And it's raining hard on the streetlight glow  
You got your lips on mine, its gasoline on fire  
I never will forget, you grabbed my shirt and pulled it over my head  
And your fingertips slide up and down my back  
Breathin' hard, steamin' up the glass  
Id give anything if I could bring you back home

Lately I've been noticing  
I say the same things he used to say  
And I even find myself acting the very same way  
I tap my fingers on the table  
To the rhythm in my soul  
And I jingle the car keys  
When I'm ready to go  
When I look in the mirror  
He's right there in my eyes  
Starin' back at me and I realize  
  
[Chorus]  
The older I get  
The more I can see  
How much he loved my mother and my brother and me  
And he did the best that he could  
And I only hope when I have my own family  
That everyday I see  
A little more of my father in me  
  
There were times I thought he was bein'  
Just a little bit hard on me  
But now I understand he was makin' me  
Become the man he knew that I could be  
In everything he ever did  
He always did with love  
And I'm proud today to say I'm his son  
When somebody says I hope I get to meet your dad  
I just smile and say you already have  
  
[Chorus]  
  
He's in my eyes  
My heart, my soul  
My hands, my pride  
And when I feel alone  
  
And I think I can't go on  
I hear him sayin' "Son you'll be alright"  
Everything's gonna be alright"  
Yes it is  
  
The older I get  
The more I can see  
That he loved my mother and my brother and me  
And he did the best that he could  
And I only hope when I have my own family  
That everyday I see  
Oh I hope I see  
I hope everyday I see  
A little more of my father in me  
  
A little more of my father in me  
I hope everyday I see in me  
In me  
In me  
I hope everyday I see  
  
A little more of my father in me

Out on the street corner  
Just like every morning I sit here  
And I watch you walk my way  
And even though I don't know you  
As you get closer I swear I feel  
My heart start racing, aching  
Maybe it's in my mind  
And maybe I'm only dreaming  
And I swear you catch my eye  
As you walk on by  
Oh why you gotta leave me so blue  
  
[Chorus]  
Baby why can't you see  
That I'm the only one for you  
You could search the world over  
But you'll never find another so true  
'Cause if you're looking for love  
I'm standing right in front of you  
  
(I'm standing right in front of you)  
  
I bet your heart, like mine  
Has been broken by someone  
We never should have given it to (oh no)  
So we put up a wall to keep from falling so hard  
It's so sad  
'Cause there's such good love inside  
And I've been hoping that I might find  
Someone who feels the same way  
Someone to share my life  
On this beautiful ride together  
We could see it all through  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Standing right in front of you)  
  
So this morning I'm just going to walk up, and say hello to you  
'Cause if given a choice between love and being alone  
I know which one  
I know which one I choose  
And give me a chance  
I'd be a better man for you (I believe I would)  
And open your heart girl  
Let me make your dreams come true  
  
You can search the world over  
But I can take it to the moon  
'Cause if you're looking for love  
I'm standing right in front of you (yes I am)  
Standing right in front of you  
(Standing right in front of you)  
Open your eyes, (I'm standing right in front of you)  
Just give me a chance baby  
(I'm standing right in front of you)

Well, I don't know why I came here tonight  
I got the feeling something ain't right  
I'm so scared in case I fall off my chair  
And I'm wondering if I'll get down the stairs  
Yeah clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right  
Here I am, stuck in the middle with you  
Stuck in the middle with you  
Well, I'm stuck in the middle with you  
And I'm wondering what is I should do  
It's so hard to wipe this smile from my face  
Lose control and I'm all over the place  
Yeah clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right  
Here I am, stuck in the middle with you  
Well, you started out with nothing  
And you're proud, you're a self-made man  
And your friends they all come crawling  
Slap you on the back and say, "Please, oh please"  
Oh no  
Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right  
Here I am  
Well, you started out with nothing  
And you're proud, you're a self-made man  
And your friends they all come crawling  
Slap you on the back and say, "Please, oh please"  
Well, I don't know why I came here tonight  
I got the feeling something ain't right  
I'm so scared in case I fall off my chair  
And I'm wondering if I'll get down, get get down the stairs  
Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right  
Here I am, stuck in the middle with you  
Yes, I'm stuck in the middle with you  
Stuck in the middle with you  
Here I am, well here I am stuck in the middle with you  

When I picked you up for our first date baby  
Well, your pretty blue eyes, they were drivin' me crazy  
And the tiny little thought that was so amazing  
Is they were looking at me.  
  
I held open the car door for you then you climbed  
Inside and slid on over  
To the other side, I thought my, oh my  
  
[Chorus]  
Sweet thing  
The moon is high and the night is young  
Come on and meet me  
In the backyard under the Cottonwood tree  
It's a good thing and I'm wishing  
C'mon sweet thing  
Won't you climb on out of your window  
While the world is sleeping  
You know I need you  
And there's no way I'll be leaving  
'Till we're kissing on the porch swing  
Oh my little sweet thing  
  
Yeah I know I'm gonna see you first thing tomorrow  
But I just couldn't wait so I had to borrow  
Uncle Jake's Mustang, its his favorite car  
And so I can't stay long  
  
Standing here feeling like a love struck Romeo  
All I wanna do is hold you close and steal a little  
More time, is that such a crime?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh my sweet thing  
Sweet thing, sweet thing  
  
Oh my sweet thing  
The moon is high and the night is young  
Come on and meet me  
In the backyard under the cottonwood tree  
It's a good thing and tell me I'm not dreaming  
C'mon sweet thing  
Won't you climb on out of your window  
While the world is sleeping  
Cause you know I need you  
And there's no way I'll be leaving  
'Till we're kissing on the porch swing  
Oh my little sweet thing  
  
Oh c'mon sweet thing, sweet thing, sweet thing, sweet thing  
  
Yeah, c'mon now a little now  
Do do do do do do do do do do do  
Oh my little sweet thing, yes you are  
Do do do do do do do do do do do

You know the cards are stacked against this  
As we surrender our defenses  
And I've torn down all my fences just for you  
And you feel it too  
What do we do  
Do we run or see it through  
The longer we're together  
It just keeps gettin' better  
And you hide your little love letters  
Around the house for me  
And it's plain to see  
That you'll always be all I'll ever need  
  
[Chorus]  
The webs we spun  
Wove into one  
And left us tangled up in love  
You squeeze my hand I understand  
About a woman and a man  
I love the way you make me feel  
You got me tangled up in love  
The webs we spun  
Wove into one  
Left us tangled up in love  
  
[Chorus]

There were nights where I was sure  
I wouldn't see the morning sun  
And there were days that seemed so dark  
I couldn't wait for night to come  
  
I couldn't stand to think about how  
My life used to be  
And how without a single warning  
It all slipped away from me  
  
And like a fool I thought that I could fight  
The shadows on my own  
To the dark I was no stranger  
But this was stronger than I'd known  
  
And by the time I knew that I was in too deep  
I'd gone too far  
And the light that used to guide me  
Had faded from my heart  
  
And I found myself in places I thought I'd never go  
Surrounded by strangers I was so far from home  
And I don't know how you found me  
All I know is I owe you everything to you  
Yes I do  
  
[Chorus]  
And I thank you for my heart  
I thank you for my life  
And I thank god for grace and mercy  
And that you became my wife  
I'm seeing for the first time  
The stars, the sun and moon  
But they've got nothing on the power  
Of this love I have for you  
  
And I thank you, I thank you  
  
Now people say they'll stand beside you  
They swear they never leave  
But when the rain started falling  
You know it only fell on me  
  
and it was hard to keep believing in myself  
When all I felt was so much pain  
And guilt and shame  
I couldn't even as for help  
  
I don't know if I believe in other lives  
But when you came  
There was something so familar  
About the way you said my name  
  
And the whole world started turning  
And I swear that I'd been born again brand new  
And it's all because of you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And I thank you  
  
And I've seen so many things  
That I just can't explain  
But the miracle of miracles is how  
With your love I was saved  
  
And I thank you for my heart  
I thank you for my life  
I thank god for grace and mercy  
And that you became my wife  
And I'm seeing for the first time  
The stars, the sun and moon  
But they've got nothing on the power  
Of all this love I give to you  
  
And I thank you for my heart  
I thank you for my life  
I thank god for grace and mercy  
And that you became my wife  
The day I started breathing  
Was the day you took my hand  
And 'till the day I die  
Baby, I'll forever be your man  
And I thank you, I thank you  
Oh, yes I do  
Oh, don't you know, that I thank you  
Oh

I know a place where love flows like water  
You sit on the bank and pass the time away  
So take my hand I want to show you something  
My very own lover's hideaway  
  
[Chorus]  
And I will take you down the river  
Where we'll will be lovin' in the shade of the old willow tree  
I'll take you down to the river  
Where you and I can just be you and me  
  
I see us know just lyin' underneath the heavens  
Sippin' on wine with nothing much to do  
Just you in my arms when the sun is settin'  
Then makin' sweet love in the night of Mr Moon  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You know I"ll love you anyway  
All I will feel the same until the sun don't shine  
All I want to do is stay  
Cause you're a once in every lifetime oh  
  
[Chorus: x2]

THE TWELFTH OF NEVER  
WITH DOLLY PARTON  
WRITERS JERRY LIVINGSTON, PAUL FRANCIS WEBSTER  
  
You ask me how much I need you, must I explain? I need you, oh my darling,
like roses need rain You ask how long I'll love you, I'll tell you true Until
the Twelfth of Never, I'll still be loving you Hold me close, never let me go
Hold me close, melt my heart like April snow I'll love you 'til the bluebells
forget to bloom I'll love you 'til the clover has lost it's perfume I'll love
you 'til the poets run out of rhyme Until the Twelfth of Never and that's a
long, long time Until the Twelfth of Never and that's a long, long time

My grandma was a wise old soul  
Took me by the hand not long ago  
Said, "Son, what's your hurry, boy slow it down  
Taste the wild honey, listen to the sound  
Of the wind that's blowin' through the trees  
Rivers flowin' to the sea  
Yeah they're all headin' home just like you and me  
Life's for livin' child, can't you see that?"  
  
These are the days we will remember  
And these are the times that won't come again  
The highest of flames become an ember  
And you gotta live 'em while you can  
  
These are the days we will remember [Repeat: x4]  
  
So take 'em by the hand, they're yours and mine  
Take 'em by the hand and live your life  
Take 'em by the hand don't let 'em all fly by  
C'mon, c'mon now  
  
Oh days go by  
Yeah, just like a hand out the window wavin' in the wind as the cars go by  
Days go by

Another long summer's come and gone  
I don't know why it always ends this way  
The boardwalk's quiet and the carnival rides  
Are as empty as my broken heart tonight  
  
But I close my eyes and one more time  
We're spinning around and you're holding on tightly  
The words came out, I kissed your mouth  
No Fourth of July has ever burned so brightly  
You had to go, I understand  
But you promised you'd be back again  
And so I wander 'round this town  
'Til summer comes around  
  
I got a job working at the old park pier  
And every summer now for five long years  
I grease the gears, fix the lights, tighten bolts, straighten the tracks  
And I count the days til you just might come back  
  
And then I close my eyes and one more time  
We're spinning around and you're holding on tightly  
The words came out, I kissed your mouth  
No Fourth of July has ever burned so brightly  
You had to go, I understand  
But you swore you'd be back again  
And so I'm frozen in this town  
'Til summer comes around  
And it comes around  
  
And I close my eyes and you and I  
Are stuck on the Ferris wheel rocking with the motions  
And Hand in hand we cried and laughed  
Knowing that love belonged to us girl, if only for a moment  
And "Baby I'll be back again" you whispered in my ear  
But now the winter wind is the only sound  
And everything is closing down  
'Til summer comes around  
'Til summer comes around  
'Til it comes around  
And it comes around

Alone in this house again tonight  
I got the TV on, the sound turned down and a bottle of wine  
There's pictures of you and I on the walls around me  
The way that it was and could have been surrounds me  
I'll never get over you walkin' away  
  
[Chorus]  
I've never been the kind to ever let my feelings show  
And I thought that bein' strong meant never losin' your self-control  
But I'm just drunk enough to let go of my pain  
To hell with my pride, let it fall like rain  
From my eyes  
Tonight I want to cry  
  
Would it help if I turned a sad song on  
"All By Myself" would sure hit me hard now that you're gone  
Or maybe unfold some old yellow lost love letters  
It's gonna hurt bad before it gets better  
But I'll never get over you by hidin' this way  
  
[Chorus: x2]

If I could be anywhere with anyone  
You know exactly where I'd be  
Under the covers waitin' for the sun to rise  
Your head on the pillow next to me  
  
Your feet propped up on that kitchen chair  
Mornin' papers scattered all around you  
Coffee brewin' on that cast-iron stove  
And the pleasure of just knowin' that you're mine  
  
Well, I love the way you look  
Love the way you feel  
And the way you roll your eyes at the kisses that I steal  
Love the way you stare  
When you're starin' right at me  
I just love your company, oh yes, I do  
  
Arm-in-arm on some spring sidewalk day  
Laughin' just because it feels so right  
Wrapped up under the blankets, all cozy by the fire  
As long as you're here, close enough to touch  
  
Well, I love the way you look  
Love the way you feel  
And the way you roll your eyes at the kisses that I steal  
Love the way you stare  
When you're starin' right at me  
And I just love your company, oh yes, I do  
  
Well, I love the way you look  
Love the way you smell  
And I love your pretty eyes and the lies they never tell  
Love the way you stare  
When you're starin' right at me  
And I just love your company

And so I wrote this song for you  
I think I know just what you're going through  
Did you believe you'd never change?  
Nothin' ever stays the same  
  
I know it's hard holdin' on  
Even harder trying to let it go  
And so you're frozen like a stone  
But you are not alone  
  
[Chorus]  
Every step I take  
I get a little less afraid  
Of giving in to love, love  
Let it out  
Believe me when I say  
It gets better every day  
Once you get used to the pain  
  
What you hide inside I see  
There's a scar that's always gonna be  
There's a past in everyone  
You can't undo  
You can't outrun  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Once you get used to the pain

The rain is coming down tonight  
I'm smiling looking at this photograph  
I hear that song and I'm flying right back  
To when we had it made  
Every Friday night when the sun went down  
We'd be running them streets like we owned the town  
  
And I just can't let it go, no, I just can't let it go  
I wonder if you ever think about it like I do  
Seven kids on a two lane road  
Had the guns on the radio  
After all this time it still feels, feels so good  
  
When I think about those summer nights  
Singing out the window, on the back roads, Sweet Child of Mine  
Sipping on the local's spark of light  
Ain't it funny how the best days of my life  
Was all that wasted time, all that wasted time  
  
Out of nowhere, it slipped away  
And the rope by the river hangs silently  
And the town that we knew ain't nothing like it used to be  
Ah, I can't explain  
They took all the color from the picture frame  
And the days got sold to the grid and the game  
  
And I just can't let it go, no, I just can't let it go  
I wonder if you ever think about it like I do  
Seven kids on a two lane road  
We had the guns on the radio  
After all this time it still feels, feels so good  
  
When I think about those summer nights  
Singing out the window, on the back roads, Sweet Child of Mine  
Sipping on the local's spark of light  
Ain't it funny how the best days of my life  
Was all that wasted time, all that wasted time  
Swinging on the line  
Living all that wasted time  
  
Hey, hey, now  
Summer dresses drying out on the hood of the car  
Only music that we had was out the left speaker  
We were living every second 'til the time ran out  
We had nothing but we had it all  
  
When I think about those summer night  
Sneaking out the window, running back roads  
Your hand in mine  
We were going nowhere, we were so alive  
Uh huh, ain't it crazy how the best days of my life  
Was all that wasted time, all that wasted time  
We were swinging out on the line  
Living all that wasted time  
  
Hey, you know oh  
All that wasted time  
Don't you feel it coming on back now  
Time, time, time

Rearview crosses  
Railroad ties  
Oh, Hail Marys  
Friday nights  
Heartbeat baby  
Low-beam lights  
God, I miss when you were mine  
  
[Chorus]  
Back when that song was a song  
I could sing along without thinkin bout you every time it came on  
Every beat, every line, every word, every time  
When a road was a road  
I could roll on through without wishin that empty seat was you  
Money was gas, dreams were dust  
Love was fast and we were us  
  
Shotgun sunset  
A cool mint kiss  
Backseat promise  
Breaking it  
Floorboard feeling  
County lines  
God, I miss when you were mine  
  
[Chorus]  
  
In a sleepy town, just jumping in  
Far too young to know that summers end  
We were us, we can't go back  
It's what it is, but God I miss  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Every beat, every line, every word, every single time  
I just close my eyes and you're ridin shotgun  
You and me, baby, on the run  
I can feel your heartbeat, baby

I'm livin' in a world that won't stop pullin' on me  
I'm not complaining but it's true  
It's like I owe my time to everyone else  
'Cause that's all I seem to do  
  
You might not notice but I need a good friend  
Someone to talk to when I'm down, down, down  
There's so much on my mind that I want to get out  
But there's no one around  
  
[Chorus]  
Sometimes I can't help thinkin' what about me  
Some days go by that I don't even see  
Yeah I'm doing everything right and I can't break free  
Oh is this the way it's always gonna be  
What about me  
  
Well I'm dreamin' I'm on a highway with the windows down  
I'm burnin' up the road at my own speed  
But I'm stuck here goin' nowhere in this traffic jam  
And there's a woman with her kids in the car next to me  
And I swear she's singin'  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Oh what about me  
Hey what about me

You come here lookin' for sympathy  
Cause it's not everything you thought it would be  
Don't waste your time  
You can't understand why it comes and goes  
The sudden storms, the highs and lows  
So you stand here cryin'  
Girl get in line  
  
What love is that way  
You're waitin' time pretending  
What love is that way  
When you walk through life expecting  
So much, so soon  
Love can only hurt you  
What love is that way  
What love is ever that way  
  
The more you wish and the more you dream  
The more the reality never seems  
What it ought to be  
It's never perfect as when it begins  
Time always seems to put an end  
To the fantasy, It seems to me  
  
What love is that way  
You're waitin' time pretending  
What love is that way  
When you walk through life expecting  
So much, so soon  
Love can only hurt you  
What love is that way  
What love is ever that way  
  
So much, so soon, Love can only hurt you  
What love is that way  
What love is ever that way, What love is that way

I got no money in my pockets  
I got a hole in my jeans  
I had a job and I lost it  
But it won't get to me  
  
'Cause I'm ridin' with my baby  
And it's a brand new day  
We're on the wheels of an angel  
Flyin' away  
  
[Chorus]  
And the sun is shinin'  
This road keeps windin'  
Through the prettiest country  
From Georgia to Tennessee  
And I got the one I love beside me  
My troubles behind me  
I'm alive and I'm free  
Who wouldn't want to be me  
  
Now she's strummin' on my six-string  
Across her pretty knees  
She's stompin' out a rhythm  
And singin' to me the sweetest song  
  
The sun is shinin'  
This road keeps windin'  
Through the prettiest country  
From Georgia to Tennessee  
And I got the one I love beside me  
My troubles behind me  
I'm alive and I'm free  
Who wouldn't want to be me  
  
Oh the sun is shinin'  
And this road keeps windin'  
Through the prettiest country  
From Georgia to Tennessee  
I got the one I love beside me  
My troubles behind me  
I'm alive and I'm free  
Who wouldn't want to be me  
  
I got no money in my pockets  
I got a hole in my jeans  
We're on the wheels of an angel  
And I'm free  
She's strummin' on my six-string  
It's across her pretty knees  
She's stompin' out a rhythm  
And singin' to me

I just kissed you goodbye  
A half an hour ago  
I know you've driven to the airport  
But I just gotta pick up the phone  
And hear you one more time  
Saying my name  
I must be going outta my mind  
  
Why's it feel so long  
Since you've been gone  
Why's it feel so long  
  
Time keeps dragging on  
Til you get back home  
Why's it feel so long  
Baby  
  
Cause I miss you babe  
  
I've never loved anyone like I love you  
So when you're not around  
I must confess I lose myself  
And I don't know who where I am  
I might be crazy  
Crazy about being your man  
  
Why's it feel so long  
Since you've been gone  
Why's it feel so long  
I don't know why  
Time keeps dragging on  
Til you get back home  
Why's it feel so long  
  
When I finally see you  
I know it'd be like never left alone  
But there's no cantillation  
Tonight isn't waiting  
Praying maybe you'll come  
Coming coming babe  
  
Tell me now  
  
Why's it feel so long  
Since you've been gone  
Why's it feel so long  
I don't know why  
Time keeps dragging on  
Til you get back home  
Why's it feel so long  
  
Why's it feel so long  
Since you've been gone  
Why's it feel so long  
I don't know why  
Time just cross along  
Til you get back home  
Why's it feel so long  
  
I look at my watch  
Stare at the clock  
And they don't move  
I don't need a round  
I'm just froze on the couch  
Oh the seconds feel like hours  
An hour's like a day  
It's a twilight zone in this home  
When you go away  
  
Please don't go away

Everybody says  
That when it comes to friends  
The truest ones are counted on one hand  
But take a look around  
Before you hit the ground  
The only one you'll see will be this man  
  
Yeah, I'll catch you when you fall  
'Cause I'm the one who loves you  
You'll never wonder if I care  
I'll always be there  
Standin' there in losin' ground  
I'm your best friend now  
And I won't let you down, no, oh  
  
Yes, I've been a fool  
But I've learned what not to do  
Don't take for granted those who keep their faith in you  
And if you lose your way  
On some rainy day  
Just look above  
And I will be the sunshine breakin' through  
  
Yeah, I'll catch you when you fall  
'Cause I'm the one who loves you  
You'll never wonder if I care  
I'll always be there  
Standin' there in losin' ground  
I'm your best friend now  
And I won't let you down  
  
And every step along the highway  
Of your life  
I'll be the man standing beside you  
Believe me that I will  
Don't forget: you came, and you saved me  
You saved my life  
  
Yeah, I'll catch you when you fall  
'Cause I'm the one who loves you  
You'll never wonder if I care  
I'll always be there  
Standin' there in losin' ground  
'Cause I'm your best friend now  
And I won't let you  
I will not let you  
I won't let you down

I remember as a kid wishin' I was seventeen  
No more school, my own car.  
Back then it was all a dream  
Then came the day to say goodbye  
To the room that was once mine  
One last look at my old world then  
I closed the door behind, to  
  
[Chorus]  
Yesterday, everything was easy  
Livin' life like there was no tomorrow  
Now everyday memories still remind me  
How good things used to be yesterday  
  
Well thirty-five soon rolled around  
And everything had changed  
I could count friends on one hand and  
The good times weren't the same  
But finally I cam to understand why people say  
Don't spend all your childhood wishin'  
The best years away  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now I'm longin' for the freedom  
That I let slip away  
I took it all for granted  
Now it's gone like yesterday  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Remembering all those years, yesterday

One, two, three baby don't think twice  
Just like that you gotta brand new life  
Hop in this truck and run through the red lights  
  
Yeah where you wanna go, baby name the town  
We can go up north or head down south  
Roll down the windows with the radio loud  
  
Come on turn it up, yeah  
Start living your life  
On the double, leave your troubles behind  
You knew we're gonna be alright  
  
[Chorus]  
You could be a black bird  
On a country street  
Hiding from the world with a broken wing  
But you better believe, you gonna fly with me  
You could be a songbird from the New Orleans  
Scared of the rain just scared to sing  
But you better believe, you're gonna fly with me  
  
Well, here we are baby in the back of my van  
Sun's going down sky's turning red  
Stars coming out  
Baby look at you now  
  
God know how long but its been a while  
Since I heard you laugh and I'd seen that smile  
Felt that kiss and I can get use to this  
Baby I could get use to this  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You're gonna fly  
You're gonna fly  
  
You could be a black bird  
On a country street  
Hiding from the world with a broken wing  
But you better believe, you gonna fly with me  
You could be a songbird from the New Orleans  
Scared of the rain just as scared to sing  
But you better believe yeah you better believe oh baby  
  
You could be a black bird  
On a country street  
Hiding from the world with a broken wing  
But you better believe, you gonna fly with me  
You could be a songbird from the New Orleans  
Scared of the rain just as scared to sing  
But you better believe you're gonna fly with me  
  
You're gonna fly  
You're gonna fly with me baby  
You better believe my honey girl  
Ooh yeah, you're goin' to fly

Outside my window, I swear on my mamas grave,  
Faded out the street noise like an out of focus Polaroid,  
So I shot the moon, and I cursed the wind,  
Making me think that you were, here again,  
Smoke and mirrors, somebody stole you away,  
That's the biggest conspiracy since, JFK,  
So we combed the corners, and glass houses,  
Right directions, but, never found it.  
  
Well I'd trade in all the rest of my days,  
Just the mere reflection of your face,  
For one shining moment  
  
With you, or somebody like you,  
With you, or somebody just like you,  
  
Called inspectors, the cops and the CIA,  
The drew chalk circles round, the place that we used to lay,  
But nobody testified, not a single witness,  
I swore I was crucified with, no forgiveness,  
The sheriff shined his light like I was drunk and dangerous,  
My hands were already tied, so he , put away his handcuffs,  
And in my blindspot, I saw the silhouette,  
Your crazy legs smoking a long black cigarette,  
But I'd trade in all the rest of my days,  
Your crooked smile, your wicked ways,  
I'd fill up all this empty space,  
  
With you, or somebody like you,  
With you, or somebody just like you,  
Oh you, or somebody like you, oh  
  
Now I should of learned my lesson,  
Done what I was told,  
Should of counted all my blessings,  
Like fingers and toes,  
And now I'm, tripping like a blind man,  
And searching high and low,  
For you, or somebody like you  
For you, or somebody just like you  
  
For you, or somebody like you,  
For you, or somebody just like you, oh oh  
  
Yeah, whoa somebody just like you  
Oh somebody just like you, oh

The first time I looked in your eyes I knew  
That I would do anything for you  
The first time you touched my face I felt  
What I'd never felt with anyone else  
  
I want to give back, what you've given to me  
And I want to witness all of your dreams  
Now that you've shown me who I really am  
I want to be more than just your man  
  
I want to be the wind that fills your sails  
And be the hand that lifts your veil  
And be the moon that moves your tide  
The sun coming up in your eyes  
Be the wheel that never rusts  
And be the spark that lights you up  
All that you've been dreaming of and more, so much more  
I want to be your everything  
  
When you wake up I'll be the first thing you see  
And when it gets dark you can reach out to me  
I'll cherish your words and I'll finish your thoughts  
I'll be your compass baby when you get lost  
  
I want to be the wind that fills your sails  
Be the hand that lifts your veil  
Be the moon that moves your tide  
The sun coming up in your eyes  
Be the wheel that never rusts  
And be the spark that lights you up  
All that you've been dreaming of and more, so much more  
I want to be your everything  
  
I'll be the wheel that never rusts  
And be the spark that lights you up  
All that you've been dreaming of and more, so much more  
I want to be your everything  
I want to be your everything  
I want to be your everything, I want to be your everything

I know it's gonna take some time  
For you to trust this love of mine  
I know he broke your heart in two  
You've been betrayed and ... your afraid  
That I will do the same to you  
  
But you'll be safe here in my arms ... forever and a day  
Though you don't believe me now ... I'll never walk away  
You ... You know that I'll be there ... when tomorrow comes  
  
( Your the only one )  
I know you've heard this all before  
( Your the only one )  
Your the one that I adore  
( Your the only one )  
You make me shine just like the sun  
( Your the only one )  
You bring this heart of mine undone  
( Your the only one )  
  
For evry Lie you've ever heard  
You can believe my every word... yes you can  
Whatever heaven holds in store  
Through good and bad ... I'll be your man  
Stand beside you through it all  
  
But you'll be safe here in my arms ... forever and a day  
Though you don't believe me now ... I'll never walk away  
And you ... you know that I'll be there ... when tomorrow comes  
  
( Your the only one )  
I know you've heard this all before  
( Your the only one )  
Your the one that I adore  
( Your the only one )  
You make me shine just like the sun  
( Your the only one )  
You bring this heart of mine undone  
( Your the only one )  
  
I know you've heard this all before  
( Your the only one )  
But your the one that I adore  
( Your the only one )  
You make me shine just like the sun  
( Your the only one )  
You bring this heart of mine undone  
( Your the only one )  
  
( Your the only one )  
  
Make me shine just like the sun ... yes you do  
  
( Your the only one )

Car door slams, it's been a long day at work  
I'm out on the freeway and I'm wondering if it's all worth  
The price that I pay, sometimes it doesn't seem fair  
I pull into the drive and you're standing there  
And you look at me  
And give me that come-here-baby smile  
It's all gonna be alright  
You take my hand  
You pull me close and you hold me tight  
  
[Chorus]  
And it's the sweet love that you give to me  
That makes me believe we can make it through anything  
'Cause when it all comes down  
And I'm feeling like I'll never last  
I just lean on you 'cause baby  
You're my better half  
  
They say behind every man is a good woman  
But I think that's a lie  
'Cause when it comes to you I'd rather have you by my side  
You don't know how much I count you to help me  
When I've given everything I got and I just feel like giving in  
And you look at me  
And give me that come-here-baby smile  
It's all gonna be alright  
You take my hand  
Yeah you pull me close and you hold me tight  
  
And it's the sweet love that you give to me  
That makes me believe we can make it through anything  
'Cause when it all comes down  
And I'm feeling like I'll never last  
I just lean on you 'cause baby  
You're my better half  
  
Well, you take my hand  
Yeah you pull me close and I understand  
  
It's the sweet love that you give to me  
That makes me believe that we can make it through anything  
  
Oh baby, it's the sweet love that you give to me  
That makes me believe we can make it through anything  
'Cause when it all comes down  
And I'm feeling like I'll never last  
I just lean on you 'cause baby  
You're my better half  
  
Oh, oh baby you're my better half  
Oh, hey baby you're my better half

We all drink to forget  
Some of us more than most  
When reality gets too real  
And the fires of hell to close  
But I'm here to let you know that  
That you can make it through  
If you believe that someone is watchin' over you  
  
[Chorus]  
And call it an angel  
Call it a muse  
And call it karma that you've got comin' to you  
What's the difference  
What's in name  
What matters most is never ever losin' faith  
'Cause it's gonna be alright  
You're not alone tonight  
  
We all have our days  
When nothing goes as planned  
Not a soul in the world  
Seems to understand  
And for someone to talk to  
You'd give anything  
Well go on and cry out loud  
'Cause someone's listenin'  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Keep your faith alive  
You're not the only one  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh you can cry if you want to, go on

It's just a piece of paper,  
It says, "In God We Trust"  
A little sure felt good  
But a lot was not enough  
And everybody loved me when I was on a roll  
And I thought I had everything  
When I held the gold  
  
[Chorus]  
But you're not my god  
And you're not my friend  
You're not the one  
That I will walk with in the end  
You're not the truth  
You're a temporary shot  
You ruin people's lives  
And you don't give a second thought  
You're not my god  
  
Little white lies on a mirror  
Cut neatly in a roll  
Medicine that kept me from lookin' in my soul  
I thought you were the answer  
To all of my despair  
And you almost had me six feet down  
But I'm still breathin' air  
  
[Chorus]  
  
From the cradle to the grave  
Temptations all around  
But no matter how good the fix  
It's gonna take you down  
Now some call it a weakness  
Some call it a sin  
But it's all the same behind each game  
I see your evil grin  
  
But you're not my god  
And you're not my friend  
You're not the one  
That I will walk with in the end  
You're not the truth  
You're a temporary shot  
You ruin people's lives  
And you don't give a second thought  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You're not my god  
Oh oh oh you're not my god  
You're not my god  
Not my god  
Not my god  
You're not, you're not, you're not my god  
No you're not
