Wake up in the morining with nothing to do  
Gotta start the day off with a case of brew  
Hit the street at noon with beer stinkin breath  
Go down to the river with a 20 pack of green death  
Liquored up and pissed off on a saturday  
Night if the beer runs out theres gonna have to be a fight  
Scrounging for change just to buy a half rack  
Well I guess it beats smoking crack  
Its quantity not quality that counts  
Its best when its served in mass amounts  
Rather spend the evening getting drunk  
Than getting laid beer brigade  
Falling down shit faced totally drunk  
Stupid dirtyminded fucking river rat punx  
Sitting around sluggin down the malt liqour  
Listening to gg and trying to be sicker  
Drinkin to get drunk who cares about taste  
Pop a pigs eye and pour it in your face  
Drinkin to remember just drinkin too forget  
Drinkin cause we just don't give a shit  
Beer brigade

  
Ya get to the party and yell out,  
"Who's got the cups?"  
You're on a mission,  
A mission to get fucked up.  
Ya baby-sit the keg until  
It's spittin' out just foam.  
Yer just gettin' buzzed so  
There's no talk of goin' home  
Beer run! Beer run!  
The keg is fried, let's get  
Another one.  
Beer run! Beer run!  
It's way too early to end the fun.  
Beer run! Beer run!  
The kegs have run dry but we've  
Got money form the door.  
We got empties for deposit so we  
Can get a couple more.  
We've only got ten minutes  
To make it to the liquor store  
Get yer ass in gear or this night'll  
Be a fuckin' bore.  
Beer run! Beer run!  
The keg is fried, let's get  
Another one.  
Beer run! Beer run!  
It's way too early to end the fun.  
Beer run! Beer run!  
Hurry up and name yer poison  
I want another beer bong  
Any ball-tap keg'll do  
Fuck that leaky two-prong  
All of 'em have alcohol  
So just grab the cheapest one.  
Let's get back to the party and  
Roll out that barrel of fun!  
Beer run! Beer run!  
The keg is fried, let's get  
Another one.  
Beer run! Beer run!  
It's way too early to end the fun.  
Beer run! Beer run!  
You're on a mission,  
A mission to get fucked up.  
Head to the store,  
To get some more.  
Have no fear,  
There'll be more beer.  
The taps will flow  
We'll do some blow

Can't end the fun.  
BEER RUN!!!

Mr. Brady in a martial spat killed Mrs. Brady with a baseball bat  
Now in prison his debt will be paid he left six kids with  
A drug addicted maid, Alice shoots smack every day of the week,  
The kids went wild and they turned into freaks  
One day they cooked tiger up for lunch, that's what happened to the Brady
Bunch  
[Chorus:]  
They didn't just go into sindication  
They practiced all sorts of deviation  
The Brady Bunch Gregs in the big house for sellin' coke, every night he  
Gets his corn hole poked, Marsha's livin' way down in Mexico  
She makes her living in a donkey show, Pete found a job  
As a side show geek, bites the heads off of chickens  
While they squak and sqeek, Jan found her self, now  
Shes a dyke shes got tatooz leather boots and a  
Motor bike  
[Chorus:]  
Bobby was a minister on television  
Now he's facing life in prison, molested little kids and he  
Fucked a goat, stole a million dollars and sailed away on  
A boat, Cindy ended up bein' my bitch shes out on the street  
Corner maken me rich, evernight I stick my dick in her  
Face and tie her little blonde big tails around my waist  
[Chorus:]

Wake in the morning my mind is all confused  
Don't no where to turn or what to do, pour myself  
A great big bowl of crispy bits of rice, the cereal  
That talks gives me some advice  
  
[Chorus]  
My rice krispies told me to kill you tonight  
My rice krispies never lie  
My rice krispies  
  
Told me so many things you see, like how the  
Phone company killed kennedy, how oprah is an  
Alien and nixon never lied, and by tommorow  
Morning you gotta die [chorus] this morning  
Breakfast message was so crystal clear  
It was so strange I couldn't believe my ears  
  
My cereal informed me your an agent for  
The feds, the CIA they want me dead  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Elvis is alive living in New Jersey  
That's right they gotta give me a lobotomy  
One day the aliens are gonna come for me  
I gotta kill you if I wanna be free

  
Last call has come and gone for us  
Down at our favorite bar.  
We got more beer at home but  
We can't walk 'cause' its too far  
Got a brand new set of wheel, and  
It's parked right out in the back  
It's called the DRUNK TANK  
And it's hell on tracks!  
We're having trouble walking  
So I guess we better drive.  
Don't even have to worry  
If we'll make it home alive.  
With twenty-seven tons  
Of fine carbon steel,  
It doesn't matter if you're fucked up  
When you get behind the wheel!  
Lock and load get on the road,  
In the Drunk Tank!  
Grinding gears and pounding beers,  
In the Drunk Tank!  
Inebriated, Amout plated,  
In the Drunk Tank!  
Drive and swill and shoot to kill,  
In the Drunk Tank!  
Set off to the bar  
With happy hour in out sights.  
Several hours later  
We'll be blacked out in a fire fight.  
Cut off by the bartender  
We'll drive right through the door  
With a cannon pointed at his head  
I bet he'll serve some more  
Flashing reds behind us  
But we won't pull to the side  
Swivel 'round the turret  
Johnny-law had better hide  
Let loose with the machine gun,  
Watch his car disintegrate.  
Now he's writing tickets  
From the wrong side of hell's gates  
Lock and load get on the road,  
In the Drunk Tank!  
Grinding gears and pounding beers,  
In the Drunk Tank!  
Inebriated, Amout plated,  
In the Drunk Tank!  
Drive and swill and shoot to kill,  
In the Drunk Tank!  
Drunk tank!!!  
Drunk tank!!!  
Drunk tank!!!  
Drunk tank!!!  
Drunk tank!!!  
Drunk tank!!!  
Drunk tank!!!  
Drunk tank!!!  
  
  
  

  
I hate Christians and I hate Jews  
I hate my friends and I hate you  
I hate the blacks and whites and reds  
I hope to see them all dead  
[Chorus:]  
I'm not prejeduced, 'cause I hate everyone  
And don't you ask me why, 'cause I just think its fun  
I hate the politically correct  
I hate jocks and I hate rednecks  
I hate the corporate fucking clones  
I hate faggots and homophobes  
[Repeat Chorus]  
I hate capitalists and I hate commies  
I hate daddies and I hate mommies  
I hate straightedgers and I hate drunks  
I hate skinhead and I hate punks  
[Repeat Chorus]  
  
  
  

  
well you say its always darkest  
Just before it turns pitch black  
If you ever had a good time  
You'd probably have a heart attack  
You've only got two moods  
Self pity and depression  
I'm really fucking sick of it  
So let me give you a suggestion  
Kill yourself, Kill yourself, Kill yourself  
Death might be fun why don't you try and see  
Kill yourself, Kill yourself, Kill yourself  
Just put us all out of your misery  
You think the worlds against you  
But you dring it on yourself  
I think you need a doctor  
Maybe Kavorkian can help  
Lets have your funeral now  
I'll run you over with the hearse  
Death might improve your attitude  
You know it couldn't get any worse  
  
  
  

  
believe it or not I wan't always this fucking cool  
I used to get a lot of shit when I was back in school  
But one day I turned the tables on all those assholes  
I filled em' all full of 9mm bullet holes  
Murder at the senior prom  
Mass murder at the senior prom x2  
I padlocked the gym doors the night of the senior prom  
Under the bleachers I planted several pipe bombs  
Stood up on the balcony sub-machine gun in my hand  
Said "I'm your new prom king, does everybody understand?"  
Rounded up all the jocks who used to chase me home from school  
Tied their hands and feet and pushed them in the swimming pool  
Lined all the teachers who flunked me up against a wall  
Then one by one I stuck a butcher knife into them all  
Found that little fuck who got me busted for smokin' dope  
Now he's hanging from the flag pole kicking at the end of a rope  
Last but certainly not least when everybody else was dead  
I sodomized the cheerleaders and then I cut off all their heads  
  
  
  

  
Rush Limbaugh don't know shit about,  
"The Way Things Ought To Be"  
Let's over throw the government,  
Leave everything to me  
I've got a plan, yea  
You could call it a vision.  
I'll be the dictator  
And make all the decisions.  
This is my America,  
That's how it's gonna be,  
I've always wanted my own  
Nuclear capability  
This is my America,  
That's how it's gonna be,  
This is my America  
One nation under me.  
This is my America  
This is my America  
This is my America  
This is my America  
I've got a plan to deal with all the  
Sickos on death row,  
Gladiator fights'll  
Be your new favorite show  
Confiscate the crack babies  
From the hospitals,  
Micro-chips in their brains make  
Cyborg soldiers of 'em all  
This is my America,  
That's how it's gonna be,  
A hedonist police state  
From sea to shining sea  
This is my America,  
That's how it gonna be,  
This is my America,  
All hail Me!  
All hail Me!  
All hail Me!  
All hail Me!  
Concentration camps  
For everyone I think's a jerk  
That'll be most everyone  
And they'll do all the work  
Dissidents are put to death  
Nightly on the tube  
Executions will continue  
Until morale improves.  
This is my America,  
That's how its gonna be,  
I've always wanted my own  
Nuclear capability  
This is my America,  
That's how its gonna be,  
This is my America,  
One nation under me  
This is my America x 8  
  
  
  

  
there's a party at my place  
Bring a healthy appetite and a liter or a case.  
We got a barbecue pit out back of the house  
Turning on a spit with an apple in his mouth,  
Is the walkin' slab of bacon that tried shutting us down.  
Now he's basted in beer and turning golden brown  
Pig roast! It's my favorite meal  
Pig roast! Let's hear you squeal  
Pig roast! It's a hell of a deal  
'cause doughnut fed porker tastes like milk fed veal.  
We were drinking out in the sun,  
When this boar in blue showed up to try and spoil our fun  
Started out front as a diversion tactic,  
While the rest of the guys went up to the attic,  
Opened up the window and jumped down on his head,  
And they beat him with forty-ouncers till he was dead  
Pig roast! It's my favorite meal  
Pig roast! Let's hear you squeal  
Pig roast! It's a hell of a deal  
'cause doughnut fed porker tastes like milk fed veal.  
Officer friendly is now an entree.  
He's been turning on the rotisserie all day.  
Well it looks like the piggy couldn't stand the heat  
Now he's just pork, the other white meat  
Tenderize him with his own night stick,  
And cut him into pork-chops juicy and thick  
Pig roast! It's my favorite meal  
Pig roast! Let's hear you squeal  
Pig roast! It's a hell of a deal  
'cause doughnut fed porker tastes like milk fed veal.

A crazed obbsession for performing Bris  
All in black with long side-locks,  
And wire strippers for your cocks.  
Keep your trousers zippered up tight

They've got a contract out on you head  
They'll circumsive you in your bed  
They'll strap you down and prune your putz  
Don't wiggle or you'll loose your nuts.

Can't tell your ass from a hole in the ground  
You'd lose your fucking head if it wasn't screwed on  
You smile and you nod like you understand  
I'll slap that grin off your face with the back of my hand  
You're a drroling fucking moron with a hole in your head  
A shit talking veggie who'd be better off dead  
An imbecile, an idiot a perpetual sap  
You've gotta read the directions on a child-proof cap  
You're stupid and you think it's funny  
I bet you believe in the Easter Bunny  
You're stupid and you thinks its cool  
You think its cute when you play the fool  
[Repeat first verse]  
I hate stupid people [12x]  
[Repeat second verse]
