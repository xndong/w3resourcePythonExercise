Haunted nights for haleyon days  
Can't sleep to the scraping of his voice  
Nature's way struck grief in me  
And I became a ghost in sickness  
  
Willingly guided into heresy  
Beneath the surface, stark emptiness  
And you'd pity my conviction  
Whereas I thought of myself as a leader  
  
You'd cling to your pleasant hope  
It is twisted fascination  
While I'd ruin the obstacles into despair  
And I'm praising death  
  
Lost love of the heart  
In a holocaust scene memory  
  
Decrepit body wearing transparent skin  
Inside, the smoke of failure  
  
Wept for solace and submit to faith  
In his shadow I'm choking  
Yet flourishing  
  
Master  
  
A delusion made me stronger  
Yet I'm draped in pale withering flesh  
I sacrificed more than I had  
And left my woes beneath the mire

In the name of desperation  
I call your name  
A lamentation I sigh  
Again and again  
  
Spiritual eclipse  
The gateways are closed for me to seek  
  
The night  
A veil of stars, watching  
My shadow is born from light  
The light of the eye, in darkness  
  
Over troubled waters memories soar  
Endlessly, searching night and day  
The moonlight caresses a lonely hill  
With the calmness of a whisper  
  
I wear a naked soul  
A blank face in the streaming water  
It is cold in here  
Frost scar my coat with dust  
  
Eyes attach to your mute portrait  
We spoke only through thoughts  
Together we gazed, awaited  
Hours brought thirst and the rising sun  
  
Sun birds leave their dark recesses  
Shadows gild the archways  
  
Do not turn your face towards me  
Confronting me with my loneliness  
You are in a forest unknown  
The secret orchard  
And your voice is vast and achromatic  
But still so precious  
  
Lullaby of the crescent moon took you  
Mesmerized, its kaleidoscopic face  
Granted you a hollow stare  
Another soul within the divine herd  
  
I have kept it  
The amaranth symbol  
Hidden inside the golden shrine  
Until we rejoice in the meadow  
Of the end  
When we both walk the shadows  
It will set ablaze and vanish  
Black rose immortal  
  
It is getting dark again  
Dusk shuffle across the fields  
The evening trees moan as if they knew  
At night I always dream of you

The sun don't shine  
The moon don't move the tides  
To wash me clean  
  
The sun don't shine  
The moon don't move the tides  
To wash me clean  
  
Why so unforgiving and why so cold?  
Been a long time crossing  
The bridge of sighs  
  
Cold wind blows  
And the Gods look down in anger  
On this poor child  
  
Cold wind blows  
The Gods look down in anger  
On this poor child  
  
Why so unforgiving and why so cold?  
Been a long time crossing  
Bridge of sighs

I once upon a time  
Carried a burden inside  
Some will ask goodbye  
A broken line but underlined  
There's an ocean of sorrow in you  
  
Sorrow in me  
  
Saw movement in their eyes  
Said I no longer knew the way  
Given up the ghost  
A passing minds and its a fear  
And the wait for redemption ahead  
  
Waiting to fade  
  
Fading again  
  
If death should take me now  
Count my mistakes and let me through  
Whisper in my ear  
Taken more than we've received  
And the ocean of sorrow is you

Heal myself, a feather on my heart  
Look inside, there never was a start  
Peel myself, dispose of severed skin  
All subsides, around me and within  
  
There's nothing painful in this  
There's no upheaval  
Redemption for my pathos  
All sins undone  
  
Awaiting word on what's to come  
In helpless prayers a hope lives on  
As I've come clean I've forgotten what I promised  
In the rays of the sun I am longing for the darkness

She told me why  
She told me lies  
I always take care of this  
I told her how  
I've always stayed  
Always waited for nothing  
  
When I get out of here  
Will I leave you behind?  
I found that the years passed despite  
  
When I get out of here  
Will I leave you behind?  
I found that the years passed despite  
  
And I can see you  
Running through the fields of sorrow  
Yes I can see you  
Running through the fields of sorrow  
  
When you get out of here  
When you leave me behind  
You find that the years passed us by  
  
When you get out of here  
When you leave me behind  
You find that those years passed us by  
  
And I can see you  
Running through the fields of sorrow  
Yes I can see you  
Running through the fields of sorrow

Someone died for looking too far  
While I was asleep in my house  
A child was killed, I heard it from a friend  
A war raged in a distant land  
Cost me to linger on a piece of text  
  
Someone died  
Not here, never here  
  
There was a fever  
There is a failure  
Are you a believer?  
That someone lied to you  
  
You hold it closer to your chest  
There was a meaning for this test  
But you forgot and it's gone now  
You were controlled somehow  
  
There was a mean time  
An invitation of sorts  
I remember life  
I, I was sick with sorrow  
  
I'd fallen asleep  
And dreamt of my sins here  
It was your turn  
Adamant smile and said, "Thank you"  
  
There was a sickness right in the family  
While I shuddered in the cold  
Woman hanged for her sins while I craved mine  
An old man drowned in this life herd  
As I made amends with my fathers  
  
Someone died  
Not here, never here

Lost, here is nowhere  
Searching home still  
Turning past me, all are gone  
Time is now  
  
The omen showed, took me away  
Preparations are done, this can't last  
The mere reflection brought disgust  
No ordeal to conquer, this firm slit  
  
It sheds upon the floor, dripping into a pool  
Grant me sleep, take me under  
Like the wings of a dove, folding around  
I fade into this tender care

I can't see your face  
And I can't breathe your air  
So I wonder why I get cold inside  
When I hear your name  
  
When we meet eye to eye  
I will ask how and why  
And when guilt has its way  
One lesser reason to stay  
And I will see her cry  
  
Into the fire of our youth comes the devil again  
And you feel your way, feel your way  
  
Saw you standing nigh  
In the corner  
Told me that you had died  
And I would die when my heart was empty  
Become a ghost in perpetual void  
And neglect all reasons why

Hey you, will you be true  
When you can see through what I do  
Feel the pain in your brain, insane  
Will I see my name in your scars  
  
And you will see what you mean to me  
  
Last between the lines  
Do you feel the need  
When the night comes down  
And when the night comes down  
A father is waiting  
  
And you will see what you mean to me  
  
Lost control and called your name  
Left a home in the pouring rain  
In a sea of guilt and shame  
Will we sustain

Ghost of Mother  
Lingering death  
Ghost on Mother's bed  
Black strands on the pillow  
Contour of her health  
Twisted face upon the head  
  
Ghost of perdition  
Stuck in her chest  
A warning no one read  
Tragic friendship  
Called inside the fog  
Pouring venom brew deceiving  
  
Devil cracked the earthly shell  
Foretold she was the one  
Blew hope into the room and said:  
"You have to live before you die young"  
  
Holding her down  
Channeling darkness  
Hemlock for the Gods  
Fading resistance  
Draining the weakness  
Penetrating inner light  
  
Road into the dark unaware  
Winding ever higher  
Darkness by her side  
Spoke and passed her by  
Dedicated hunter  
Waits to pull us under  
Rose up to it's call  
In his arms she'd fall  
Mother light received  
And a faithful servant's free  
  
In time the hissing of her sanity  
Faded out her voice and soiled her name  
And like marked pages in a diary  
Everything seemed clean that is unstained  
The incoherent talk of ordinary days  
Why would we really need to live?  
Decide what is clear and what's within a haze  
What you should take and what to give  
  
Ghost of perdition  
A saint's premonition's unclear  
Keeper of holy hoards  
Keeper of holy whores  
  
To see a beloved son  
In despair of what's to come  
  
If one cut the source of the flow  
And everything would change  
Would conviction fall  
In the shadow of the righteous  
The phantasm of your mind  
Might be calling you to go  
Defying the forgotten morals  
Where the victim is the prey

And as they say, grief is only able to possess.  
The rotting body clad in ancient clothes  
Is left behind with a wave of the hand.  
I have gone away. The bed is cold and empty.  
  
Trees bend their boughs toward the earth.  
And nighttime birds float as black faces.  
It was the hand reaching out through the mirror.  
Unknown and scarred by life...  
  
The luring eyes, you had never seen.  
You have nothing more to find.  
You have nothing more to loose.  
The cold season drifts over the land.  
  
They huddle in the brown corners.  
Some would settle for less.  
The castles were all empty, asleep.  
Long awaiting their king.  
  
Beckoning round the bend.  
Amidst the forest one would hear that I had been there.  
Draped within a fate I could not change,  
And always welcoming Winter's EPILOGUE.

Kept warm by the light of the lantern  
Lost sight of everything tonight  
My presence blackens their pattern  
A pock in the healthy and calm  
  
Their scorn behind your back  
My promise would put them down  
No trace of reverence left  
Immemorial fire in their eyes  
  
I would perish at the given signal  
At the slightest touch from my soul  
Tainted prophet in flesh  
For all the plagued and lost  
  
Dripping sin  
Decision in stalemate  
Dare to feel death at hand  
Surprised me with its voice  
Through the forest came the morn  
  
Across the leafy pathway  
Their deeds smeared in blood  
For all to behold  
The council of the cross  
Must have sensed my coming  
The pest through the air  
With despise for squalor  
Lashing out at the poor  
  
I turned away my eyes  
In pallor escape from the end  
Fading time to leave from here  
And less to fulfill my task  
She would be safe and firm  
Nothing of this is in vain  
Taken away from stifling grace  
And saved from the past

I arose from the lullaby  
Enduring yet another tale  
You tempt me again  
With your embrace, so tainted  
Within the night you beckon  
Cursing me with every glance  
  
Bring me through  
Carry my empty shadow  
And guide me inside your warped labyrinth  
To the well of sin  
I swear I will always love you  
  
Leave me speechless  
Release my yearning  
The soil I walk is clad with light  
Drifting moons thrust me with their rays  
And I fall inside  
  
I lament this heritage  
Cannot bid farewell  
The pale face you went as far as you could  
And from that moment  
I witnessed your beauty, felt your death  
  
Mine is yours, mine is yours  
  
In the wake of dawn  
The mist of morning linger before it leaves  
Invisible eyes, red reflection  
It is you  
Smiling in the midst of the moor

I, lost all I had (one April day)  
I, turned to my friends (nothing to see)  
I, wrote down a name (and read it twice)  
I, wallow in shame  
  
I, said that I love (eternal skis)  
I, cling to my past (like childish dreams)  
I, promised to stay (and dwell my grief)  
I, went far away  
  
I see red spilled 'neath my feet  
Lead me through wastelands of deceit  
Rest your head now, don't you cry  
Don't ever ask the reason why  
  
Kept inside our idle race  
Grow seven idols, false embrace  
Rest your head now don't you cry  
Don't ever ask the reason why

There's nobody here, there's nobody near  
I try not to care, dead eyes always stare  
Let these matters be, don't trust what you see  
Take hold of your time, step into the line  
  
There's innocence torn from its maker  
Stillborn, the trust in you  
This failure has made the creator  
So would you tell him what to do? Would you?  
  
Leave your mark upon the head of someone  
Who'll cry for his state, we know it's too late  
I turn round to see what was meant to be  
Faint movement release to rid the disease  
  
There's innocence torn from its maker  
Stillborn, the trust in you  
I have lost all trust I had in you  
This failure has made the creator  
So would you tell him what to do?  
I have lost all trust I had in you

Once again I've cried  
Unto the moon  
That burning flame  
That has guided me  
Through all these years  
  
The lake from which you flow  
  
With eyes of fire  
Once unlit but now alive  
This energy, sparkling  
Like a morning star  
  
The morning star  
  
Riding the fires of  
The northern gold  
I've searched the eye  
I laugh under the weeping moon  
  
I am the watcher in the skies  
Nor the emeralds know my mark  
Glisten to mark their presence  
Set the enigma ablaze  
Searching  
Finding  
  
Burn the winter landmarks  
That said I was there  
Burn the spirit of cold  
That travel through my soul

Found you there in the blink of an eye  
I miss you  
Turned away into a thousand dreams  
Found out what they mean  
  
Lost you there in a moment of truth  
I trust you  
Gave away the one and only heart  
A gift to tear apart  
  
Stain me, save me  
Take me to my home  
Hold me, show me  
Take me to my home  
  
Weaker now, drawing fluid from me  
You kill me  
I'm not afraid of what you have just done  
But of what you've just become

Red sun rising somewhere through the dense fog.  
The portrait of the jaded dawn who had seen it all before.  
This day wept on my shoulders.  
Still the same as yesterday.  
This path seems endless, body is numb.  
The soul has lost its flame.  
Walking in familiar traces to find my way back home.  
So there I was.  
Within the sobriety of the immortals.  
A semblance of supernatural winds passing through.  
The garden sighs, flowers die.  
The gate was closed that day, but I was bound to carry on.  
She could not see me through the windows.  
In dismay, strangest twist upon her lips.  
Graven face, she said my name.  
Once inside I heard whispers in the parlour.  
The gilded faces grin, aware of my final demise.  
And I cried, I knew she had lied.  
Her obsession had died, it had died.  
When can I take you from this place?  
When is the word but a sigh?  
When is death our lone beholder?  
When do we walk the final steps?  
When can we scream instead of whisper?  
When is the new beginning,  
The end of this sad Madrigal.

Blank face in the windowpane  
Made clear in seconds of light  
Disappears and returns again  
Counting hours, searching the night  
  
Might be waiting for someone  
Might be there for us to see  
Might be in need of talking  
Might be staring directly at me  
  
Inside plays a lullaby  
Slurred voice over children cries  
On the inside  
  
Haunting loneliness in the eye  
Skin covering a secret scar  
His hand is waving a goodbye  
There's no response or action returned  
  
There is deep prejudice in me  
Outshines all reason inside  
Given dreams all ridden with pain  
And projected unto the last
