I saw you with that girl last night  
The both of you were making eyes  
You did it right in front of my face  
As if I had no pride  
  
And now you're always working late  
You never have much time for me  
And you're expecting me to believe  
That you're not out with she  
  
Tonight I give you my surprise  
I hope that you won't mind  
I'm giving you an eye for an eye  
Baby I've found another  
  
And he is my lover  
And I'm going out for the rest of your life  
  
I betcha never thought I'd go that far  
I betcha never thought I'd break your heart  
I betcha never even thought at all  
I betcha never, no you never  
  
I know that everybody lies, that I know I can't deny  
But what if they're intentional  
The intention of your crimes  
Cause I know how much that I can take  
  
I know my heart demands a change  
If I can't have my way, then all I have to say  
Tonight, I give you my surprise  
In return for all the lies  
I'm giving you and eye for an eye  
Baby I've found another  
  
And he is my lover  
And we're going away for the rest of your life

I could feel it when we said goodnight  
We both knew it had to end  
We couldn't make it right  
But we still come back again  
Don't be sad 'cause we gave the best we had  
  
We're better off now, better off now  
Maybe we just don't know it  
Better off now, better off now  
Maybe this time  
We're better off saying goodbye  
  
I know I'll never feel the same  
After loving you this way  
I'd do it all again  
Though I know my heart would break  
Once you've loved like this how do you admit  
  
We're better off now, better off now  
Maybe we just don't know it  
Better off now, better off now  
Maybe this time  
We're better off saying goodbye  
  
Maybe we just don't know it  
Better off now, better off now  
It's hard to realize  
We're better off saying goodbye  
  
Close your eyes and I'll be there  
If you ever think you need me  
  
We're better off now, better off now  
Maybe we just don't know it  
Better off now, better off now  
Maybe this time  
We're better off saying goodbye

For the life of me  
I never thought that it could be  
The way it stands right now  
Emotions running high  
Every night I wish that I  
Could tell you how I feel  
Those words are here in my heart  
Oh but there is just one missing part  
  
How to put it together  
How to say it right  
And let you know that  
Every night  
  
I'll be dreamin'  
Dreamin'  
Hoping baby you will be there  
I'll be dreamin'  
Dreamin'  
Hoping baby you will be there  
  
Let me take time out  
To try and find out  
If this could be real  
Cause reality scares me  
I've been living a fantasy  
How should I feel  
  
Those words are here in my heart  
Oh but there is just one missing part  
  
How to put it together  
How to say it right  
And let you know that  
Every night  
  
I'll be dreamin'  
Dreamin'  
Hoping baby you will be there  
I'll be dreamin'  
Dreamin'  
Hoping baby you will be there  

When I feel you dreaming  
I think of sunsets  
How high my high gets  
  
[Chorus:]  
I wanna give to you an everlasting love  
I wanna fill your life with a satisfying love  
All you need is an everlasting love  
All you want is a mystifying love  
  
Sun breezes, moonlight teases  
  
Friendly invasion  
Late night persuasion  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Each time you pass me by  
You saw me fade away  
I'll give you more each day

A little more giving  
A little less take  
A little more time  
To bend so we don't break  
A little less anger  
A little less pain  
A little more love  
Could surely stop the rain  
  
If you asked me if I thought  
That you loved me I'd say I know it  
But sometimes I need you to show it  
So baby  
  
Kiss me when you get out of bed  
Say the words that never get said  
Loving me should always be  
The first thing on your mind  
Tell me what I already know  
Hold me like you'll never let go  
Loving me should always be  
The first thing on your mind  
  
A little more laughter  
A little less tears  
A little more compromise  
To see us through the years  
A dream in the making  
A place of our own  
A little more give and take  
Will make a happy home  
  
If you asked me if I thought  
That you loved me I'd say I know it  
But sometimes I need you to show it  
So baby  
  
Kiss me when you get out of bed  
Say the words that never get said  
Loving me should always be  
The first thing on your mind  
Tell me what I already know  
Hold me like you'll never let go  
Loving me should always be  
The first thing on your mind  

Far away oh freedom  
  
When it's time to get up you're gonna know it  
You gonna get a felling inside, you gotta show it  
You come on relax and put your mind at ease  
And forget all your insecurities  
  
You gotta move, nothing can hold you down  
And let nothing turn your move around

Look at your heart ache as you try tell me  
The love we made was not enough for you  
You're walking away from all that we dreamed of  
The things you say are leading to...  
  
Goodbye, goodbye  
You made you mind up but your heart can't say it  
Goodbye, goodbye  
Say anything but darling don't say goodbye  
  
You wait at the door and turn 'round to see me  
The look into your eyes says you really want to stay  
And then we touch, your hands are a whisper  
They tell my heart that you can't say  
  
Goodbye, goodbye  
You made your mind up but your heart can't say it  
Goodbye, goodbye  
Say anything but darling don't say goodbye  
  
Oh baby with or without you  
I'll always love what we both knew  
  
Goodbye, goodbye  
You made your mind up but your heart can't say it  
Goodbye, goodbye  
Say anything but darling don't say goodbye  
  
Don't say goobye  
Baby, let's talk about love  
Let's talk about it now  
Please baby, don't say  
Baby, let's talk about love  
Without your love I can't go on without you  
Baby, don't say  
Baby, let's talk about love

Walk me over this situation  
Let the sun's light warm my face  
Once again the times are changing  
Once again I've lost my way  
  
While the words of acient poets  
Fall like dust upon my shoes  
Greed has grabbed me of my vision  
Turned my heart from higher truths  
  
So take my hand and lift me higher  
Be my love and my desire  
Hold me safe, in honor bound  
Take my heart to higher ground  
  
I have walked too long in darkness  
I have walked too long alone  
Blindy clutching fist of diamonds  
That I found were only stones  
  
I would trade the wealth of ages  
For a warmer hand to hold  
Though the path of life is narrow  
But it leads the streets of gold  
  
So take my hand and lift me higher  
Be my love and my desire  
Hold me safe, in honor bound  
Take my heart to higher ground  
  
In this world we move through shadows  
Never sure of what we see  
While the truth abides between us  
Come and share the truth with me  
  
So take my hand and lift me higher  
Be my love and my desire  
Hold me safe in honor bound  
Take my heart to higher ground  
  
Oh, oh

Listen up 'cause this is all I have to say  
This could be the thing to get you on your way  
Just imagine what is old and new again  
Maybe then you'll understand  
I tell you  
Take a look around and tell me that you don't see  
Just a worthless pile of garbage and debris  
I see a kingdom - Shining bright  
I can see the colors coming through, yeah  
You'll find the beauty, if you look at something right  
It's all about your point of view  
And life is all about your point of view  
Everywhere you look a story can be told  
And the tales they tell are worth their weight in gold  
In a place that's filled with mountains made of trash  
Rotting castaways and broken bits of glass  
I dare you  
Take a look around and tell me that you don't see  
Just a worthless pile of garbage and debris  
Cause I see a kingdom - Shining bright  
And if you try then you can see it too, yeah  
You'll see the beauty, if you look at something right  
It's all about your point of view  
And life is all about your point of view  
I see a kingdom - Shining bright  
I can see the colors coming through  
You'll find the beauty, if you look at something right  
It's all about your point of view  
And life is all about your point of view  
Your point of view  
Your point of view

In our times of trouble  
We only had ourselves, nobody else  
No one there to save us  
We had to save ourselves  
  
And when the storms came through  
They found me and you, Uh back together  
And when the sun would shine  
It was yours and mine, Yours and mine forever  
  
[Chorus:]  
Oh how the years go by  
Oh how the love brings tears to my eyes  
All through the changes, the soul never dies  
We fight, we laugh, we cry, As the years go by  
  
There were times we stumbled  
They thought they had us down, We came around then  
How we rolled and rambled  
We got lost and we got found  
Now we're back on solid ground  
  
We took everything  
All our times would bring, In this world of changes  
'Cause when your heart is strong  
You know you're not alone, In this world of strangers  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And if we lose our way  
Any night or day  
Well we'll always be  
Where we should be  
  
I'm there for you  
And I know you're there for me  
  
As the years go by  
  
You know you're not alone  
In this world of strangers  
  
[Chorus: x2]

Never be afraid to love  
Never be afraid to just be  
Just cast away the chains of doubt  
Have the courage to be free  
  
Don't cloud your rise with father's lies  
See only what you want to see  
To supplicate the simple truth  
Have the courage to be free  
  
Open your eyes you can fly  
Open your eyes you can fly  
You can fly (uh uh)  
You can fly  
  
Never be afraid to love (no, no, no)  
Never be afraid to just be  
Cast away the chains of doubt  
Have the courage to be free  
  
Open your eyes you can fly (fly away)  
Open your eyes you can fly  
You can fly (fly, fly, fly)  
  
Open your eyes (yeah) you can fly (fly away)  
Open your eyes you can fly

You can fly (fly away mhhm)  
  
Remember,  
You can't wait for others to applaud what you do  
So just congratulate yourself  
And start something new  
  
Open your eyes you can fly (open your eyes)  
Open your eyes you can fly (you can fly with me)  
You can fly (fly)  
  
Open your eyes (eyes) you can fly (baby yeah)  
Open your eyes (fly away with never) you can fly (fly away with never)  
You can fly  
You can fly (mhh fly away way way)  
  
Open your eyes (open your eyes) you can fly  
Open your eyes (baby) you can fly

Boy you've been running around too long  
And I think you're running out of time  
No more jumping in and out of my bed  
It's time for me to draw the line  
So you think that you call me the only one  
Then walk out the door  
And you think that you can run around having fun  
And just come back for more  
I think that you're living in a fantasy  
It's got to be them or me  
So if you try it one more time  
Baby don't expect me to come running back  
  
Running back to you  
Then you'll think about love, all the good love  
I gave to you

Running back to you  
And I'll find someone, somebody else to give it to

And I'll show you just how wrong you are  
To think I just can't get you out of my mind  
  
So you think that you can just play me off  
Then walk out the door  
And you think that you can just run around  
And come back for more  
I think that you're living in a fantasy  
It's got to be them or me  
And if you dis me once more

Sometimes the snow comes down in June  
Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon  
I see the passion in your eyes  
Sometimes it's all a big surprise  
  
'Cause there was a time when all I did was wish  
You'd tell me this was love  
It's not the way I hoped or how I planned  
But some how it's enough  
  
And now we're standing face to face  
Isn't this world a crazy place  
Just when I thought our chance had passed  
You go and save the best for last  
  
All of the nights you came to me  
When some silly girl had set you free  
You wondered how you'd make it through  
I wondered what was wrong with you  
  
'Cause how could you give your love to someone else  
And share your dreams with me  
Sometimes the very thing you're looking for  
Is the one thing you can't see  
  
And now we're standing face to face

I see all the snowflakes, falling down around me  
Falling down, lovely and wide  
And all of these snowflakes, falling down around me  
Seem so perfect, so right  
Look at them tambling down, each one is a flame  
All of them spining me, daslinly the same  
See how they flow and bend  
Swirling in neverending harmony  
They glisten as they decent,  
Sparkling like diamonds all the way  
To me it is crystal clear  
I'm not how they appear, shivering out here at my own  
See how different I am, I'm not one of them  
I'm alone  
  

I've been searching a long time  
For someone exactly like you

Waiting for you to come through  
  
Someone like you makes it all worthwhile  
Someone like you keeps me satisfied  
Someone exactly like you  
  
I've been travelin' a hard road baby  
Lookin for someone exactly like you now  
I've been carryin a heavy load  
Waiting for the light to come shining through  
  
Someone like you makes it all worthwhile  
Someone like you keeps me satisfied  
Someone exactly like you, Someone exactly like you  
  
I've been doin' some soul searching  
To find out where you're at  
I've been up and down the highway  
In all kinds of foreign lands  
  
I've been all around the world uh  
Marching to the beat of a different drum  
And just lately I've realized uh  
Baby the best is yet to come  
  
Someone like you makes it all worthwhile  
Someone like you keeps me satisfied  
Someone exactly like you makes it all worthwhile  
Someone like you now keeps me satisfied  
Someone exactly like you

It's winter time in the middle of the spring  
I can't believe it, loneliness is calling me  
And I can hear it  
See I never thought I'd feel this way  
So soon, no,  
There is something that I know I have to do  
  
Start again  
And this time I'll make it better than before  
I start again  
For the second time around  
I'll do much more, yeah,  
Cause I refuse to let life  
I'll pick the pieces up  
And start again, yeah  
  
Other roads, yeah  
Oh this time I must be careful  
When I choose them  
See love was for the taking  
But I refused it  
I never thought  
It cut so deep inside me  
Oh no  
There is something  
That I know I have to do  
  
I start again  
And this time I'll make it better than before, yeah  
Start again  
For the second time around  
I'll do much more, yeah  
Cause I refuse to let life  
I'll pick the pieces up  
And start again  
  
I can't seem to think  
Of nothing better I can do  
  
But start again  
  
And this time I'll make it better than before, yeah  
Start again  
For the second time around  
I'll do much more, yeah  
Cause I refuse to let life  
I'll pick the pieces up  
  
And start again  
  
Oh this time I'll make it better than before, yeah  
I'll start again  
For the second time around  
I'll do much more, yeah  
Cause I refuse to let life  
I'll pick the pieces up  
And start again

You look so sorry, please tell me what's wrong  
Just what are you thinking you look so forlorn  
Maybe you're thinking that I have been untrue  
So let me assure you and tell you the truth  
I'm not one to fool around  
The mistake that I made was not meant to hurt you  
I needed somehow to try and find out  
How I really felt inside  
And I know I'm  
  
Still in Love I'm so  
Still in Love  
I'm gonna be all you want me to be, cause I am  
Still in Love ooh  
Still in Love yeah  
I'm gonna do all you want me to do  
  
Don't ask no questions won't tell you lies  
It's something that happened in which I can't disguise  
I needed somebody to take me away  
From feelings of doubt which in my mind delay  
But you've always been the one  
And there are days when I know I should have told you  
  
So please don't cry  
'cause I'm gonna try  
To make you believe in me  
And I know I'm  
  
Still in Love I'm so  
Still in Love  
I'm gonna be all you want me to do  
  
You must be the one for me

I just can't you go  
So that you know baby  
Please, please don't go  
'cause you are just all that I need  
And I know I'm...

Still in Love ooh

All alone, a rainy night  
No one around but I fell someone watching me  
I look around, the street is bare nobody there  
I wonder what it could be  
As I turned to walk away  
Suddenly I saw his face  
Never minding that we were alone  
Didn't care about the time, at the moment I was felling fine  
  
I was looking into stranger's eyes  
(he caught me by surprise)  
They looked right through me  
(he looking into my eyes)  
Never knew  
Never, ever thought that love could be  
(that's when he came)  
He came and captured me  
  
Like a scene out of a dream, I can't believe it  
Kind of strange and familiar  
But in his eyes I get a sign, I get a feeling  
I get the feeling he knows me  
Maybe I could stay a while, maybe I could make you smile  
I don't have much to do  
Maybe we could walk awhile  
Maybe, maybe we could talk awhile  
  
Can't help looking into stranger's eyes  
I was looking into stranger's eyes  
(he caught me by surprise)  
They looked right through me  
(he looked into my eyes)  
Never knew  
Never, ever thought that love could be  
(that's when he came)  
He came and captured me  
  
How was I to know this would happen  
Thought I didn't know I would meet this stranger  
It's the kind of thing that dreams are made of  
And I keep thinking about stranger's eyes  
I was looking into stranger's eyes  
(he caught me by surprise)  
They looked right through me  
(he looked into my eyes)  
Never knew  
Never, ever thought that love could be  
(that's when he came to me)  
He came and captured me

I've never felt this way before  
There's nothing else I could want more  
Than something real, only passion can reveal yeah  
  
With body and soul, I'm used to controlling  
Every, everything  
Now, I can let go, let down my guard  
And we'll see how far this love can go  
  
[Chorus:]  
I surrender my heart, I'm giving up  
And I don't want to fight, I just want to love  
I surrender it all, I'm giving in  
To the power of love - surrender  
  
This feels to good, can't bring me down  
Feels like I could never touch ground  
And how I've waited, true love anticipated yeahyeah  
  
With body and mind, I know that there's time  
For every, everything  
Now, I can let go, let down my guard  
And we'll see how far this love can go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And it's just to strong and I can't hold on  
What used to be and clear to me  
It's just a fantasy  
I'm breaking down right here right now  
I want you to know gonna take you slow just  
Let the feeling flow  
  
I surrender  
I surrender my heart, I'm giving up  
I don't want to fight  
Let it flow, just want to now  
  
I surrender it all, I'm giving in  
To the power of love  
I'm giving in baby  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Cause it's just to strong and I can't hold on  
What used to be, just in clear to me  
I'm breaking down, right here right now  
Want you to know gonna let the feelings flow  
  
I surrender  
My heart my heart  
I don't want to fight no more  
My heart my heart  
Yeah, yeah, yah

What child is this who laid to rest  
on Mary's lap asleeping  
whom angels breed with anthems sweet  
while shepherds watch our keeping  
  
This, this is Christ the king  
whom shepherds guard and angels sing  
  
Haste, haste bring him lord  
the babe the son of Mary  
  
So bring him incense, bring him gold  
come pleasant king to him  
The king of kings salvations brings  
let loving hearts enthrone him  
  
Raise, raise the son on high  
the virgin sings a lullaby  
  
Joy, joy for Christ is born  
the babe was son of Mary  
  
What child is this who laid to rest  
on Mary's lap asleeping  
whom angels breed with anthems sweet  
while shepherds watch our keeping  
  
Raise, raise the son on high  
the virgin sings a lullaby  
  
Joy, joy for Christ is born  
the babe was son of Mary

I'll try to explain to friends, dear  
The reasons we two are apart  
I know what to tell our friends, dear  
But what can I tell my heart  
It's easy to say to strangers  
That we played the game from the start  
  
It's easy to lie to strangers  
But why tell a lie to your heart  
When I smile to hide all the tears inside  
What an ache it will be bring  
Then I'll wander home to a telephone  
That forgot how to ring  
  
I could say you'll soon be back, dear  
To fool the whole town may be smart  
I'll tell them you'll soon be back, dear  
But what can I tell my heart  
When I smile to hide all the tears inside  
What an ache it will be bring  
Then I'll wander home to a telephone  
That forgot how to ring  
  
I could say you'll soon be back, dear  
To fool the whole town may be smart  
I'll tell them you'll soon be back, dear  
But what can I tell my heart  
Oh, what will I tell my heart

Whatever happens  
We left some love along the way  
But it ain't reserved  
We'll think of some words of love to say  
And we'll smile oh and be happy anyway  
And we'll kiss before we say goodnight  
  
And whatever happens  
There'll be some times along the way  
When it isn't easy  
There just can't be sunshine on every day  
We'll smile oh and be happy anyway  
And we'll kiss before we say goodnight  
  
I've got you in my life  
Together we can reach a higher ground  
We'll be alright  
Just as long as you're around  
I won't let you down  
  
Whatever happens  
  
There'll be some good times and some bad  
But it ain't easy  
Let's just remember the good times that we had  
And we'll smile oh and be happy anyway  
And we'll kiss before we say goodnight  
And we'll kiss before we say goodnight yeah  
And we'll kiss before we say goodnight

Life can be strange, somethings we forget  
Or rearrange in time, lose the past  
Tell me the truth, tell me how can I know  
That this new love of ours, that its gonna last  
  
I need your strength and I feel your worth  
With you I feel protected from all harm  
  
Where do we go from here it's clear  
You erase the fear in me, that keeps me alone  
Where do we go from here I know  
No matter what the road, your love will lead me home  
  
What's in a name, his life just a game  
We color then erase (we've been erased), when we lose face  
How many lives, tell me how many tries  
Before we get it right (before we get it right), the truth is inside  
  
I need your strength and I feel your worth  
With you I feel protected from all harm  
  
Where do we go from here it's clear  
You erase the fear in me, that keeps me alone  
Where do we go from here I know  
No matter what the road, your love will lead me home  
  
When I never weak, so weak  
To scared to speak  
When I never low, so low  
To tell me, you will never need  
  
Where do we go from here it's clear  
You erase the fear in me, that keeps me alone  
Where do we go from here I know  
No matter what the road, your love will lead me home  
  
No matter what the road, your love will lead me home

Did you forget you were my man  
Were you thinking of me when you removed your ring?  
Or did you just think I would not think anything?  
  
Who were you thinkin' about? Who were you thinkin' about?  
Who were you thinkin' bout? Who were you thinkin' about?

Did you ever think of anyone but you now?

Who were you thinkin' bout? Who were you thinkin' about?  
Who were you thinkin' bout? Who were you thinkin' about?  
  
Were you thinking I would understand?  
And that I was a fool, and that I would never suspect  
You were doing wrong?  
And tell me did you feel bad? Did it feel good?  
Did it feel like you thought it would?  
And I would never know?

You are, you are, everything, everything, oh  
You are, you are, everything, everything, oh  
You are, you are, everything, everything, everything is you  
  
Today I saw somebody  
Who looked just like you  
He walked like you do  
I thought it was you  
As he turned the corner  
I called out your name  
I felt so ashamed  
When it wasn't you  
Wasn't you  
  
You are everything  
And everything is you  
You are everything  
And everything is you  
Oh you are everything  
And everything is you  
Everything is you  
  
How can I forget  
When each face that I see  
Brings back memories  
Of being with you  
I just can't go on  
Living life as I do  
Comparing each man with you  
Knowing they just won't do  
They're not you  
  
Oh you are everything  
And everything is you  
Oh, you are everything  
And everything is you  
Oh, you are everything  
And everything is you  
Everything is you  
  
You are, you are, everything, everything, oh  
You are, you are, everything, everything, oh  
You are, you are, everything, everything, everything is you  
  
You are everything  
And everything is you  
Oh, you are everything  
And everything is you  
Oh you are everything  
And everything is you  
Everything is you  
  
You are, you are, everything, everything, oh  
You are, you are, everything, everything, oh  
You are, you are, everything, everything, everything is you

All of my life  
I been searching  
For someone to find me  
I have been looking  
Waiting for your arms  
To pull Me  
  
You took Me  
In from the cold  
And out of the dark  
You have taken Me  
Into your heart  
  
Chorus  
  
You are my home  
You are the one that I come to  
You are the shelter I run to  
To keep Me safe from the cold  
You are my home  
You are the love  
That completes me  
You are the touch  
That has freed Me  
I look in your eyes  
And I know  
You are my home  
  
You were the light in the window  
When I couldnt find my way  
You led my heart to  
Want them to place me  
Here besides you  
  
You are where I always will be  
You are where I belong  
I've been looking for you  
For so long  
  
You are my home  
You are the one that I come to  
You are the shelter I run to  
To keep Me safe from the cold  
You are my home  
You are the love  
That completes me  
You are the touch  
That has freed Me  
I look in your eyes  
And I know  
You are my home  
  
And I'll never be alone  
  
Chorus  
  
Baby, baby  
Baby, You are my home  
  
I look in your eyes  
Te miro a los ojos  
Why me haces sentir  
Baby, Baby, Baby, Baby  
You are my home  
You are my home

Show me a heart that's got no passion  
I'll show you a heart that's got no life  
Show me a man that doesn't give his heart  
I'll show you man that tells you lies  
Oh you can try to run, but there's nowhere to hide  
Love is stronger than your lies  
Oh and oh, you can deny it all you want  
But love will win, it's just a matter of time  
  
You know you can't run from love  
You know, you know  
You know you can't run  
Ain't nowhere to hide  
You know, you can't run you know  
You know, you know  
You know you can't run  
Love is stronger than your lies  
  
Show me a heart that's not committed  
I'll show you a man that doesn't try  
Show me a heart that doesn't die for love  
I'll show you an empty man inside  
Oh you can run, but you won't find no place to hide  
Love don't want your heart to die  
Oh and oh, you can deny love all you want  
But love is strong and won't be denied

You don't have to say you're sorry  
We all make mistakes, I've made my share, Oh.  
You don't have to say you're sorry  
I don't need those words to know you care.  
  
Explanations aren't required even though you think you should  
I don't need to know the reasons, No, not even if they're good  
You don't have to say you're sorry, But I sure do wish you would  
  
You don't have to say you're sorry  
and that's a silly game that children play, oh  
You don't have to say you're sorry, no  
No, you shouldn't have to live that way  
  
You don't have to say you're sorry  
Cause we're both too old it's true  
Well they say when you love someone, forgiveness is the rule  
You don't have to say you're sorry, But I sure do wish you would  
  
Explanations aren't required, even though you think you should  
I don't need to know the reasons  
No, not even if they're good  
You don't have to say you're sorry  
But I sure do wish you would, I wish you would

I never know why  
Why we can't see eye to eye  
And like a fool I believed  
We would find a way to survive  
  
I wish we could be more than just a memory  
'cause we loved, we laughed, we cried  
And there's no good in goodbye  
  
You tell me you need some time  
Some time to be on my own  
Right now when I need you so  
Don't know how long it will take  
Do you expect me to wait  
But baby I gotta go  
  
Then you gotta go  
  
If you must go, you ought to know  
I will get along, I will live without you  
And if you should leave I hope you see  
I won't be around baby if you shoud leave  
You're gonna need me  
  
You might think that leaving is easy  
I had no right to lead you on  
I should have told you the moment the feeling was gone  
What I'm trying to say is that I need some space,  
I need to be sure  
  
No, you'll never find another love like me  
All around this world  
Still you tell me  
  
You tell me you need some time  
Some time to be on my own  
Right now when I need you so  
Don't now how long it will take  
But baby I gotta go  
  
Then you gotta go  
  
You said you'll always be mine  
I need to be on my own  
I gotta be on my own  
Not gotta beg you to stay  
But I'll be back boy I know  
Baby I gotta go  
  
Then you gotta go
