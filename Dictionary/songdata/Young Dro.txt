Ay, boi, wat's up, wat's hannenin'?  
It's ya boy, Young Dro, fuckin' around with me, man  
I'ma teach ya niggas how to cry, ya keep fuckin' with me  
I been doing hard shit, right, shit get fucked up  
A lot of shit get fucked up, do about it, nigga  
Could you do? Could you do? Yeah  
Hear me cry, it's like mmm, mmm, mmm  
Hear the shots they like boom, boom, boom  
Heads high at the moon, moon, moon  
And when we die, it's like soon, soon, soon  
Hear me cry, it's like mmm, mmm, mmm  
Hear the shots they like boom, boom, boom  
Heads high at the moon, moon, moon  
And when we die, it's like soon, soon, soon  
I miss grand momma Maggie, I miss Josh  
Ponto, I neva fogot cha, plus they killed Tasha  
On top of that, I got shot up and guess who did it, my patna  
Askin' God is it probably okay if he could just wash it away?  
See the expression that I got on my face  
See the weapon that I got on my waist  
I'm still trippin', my mom still slippin'  
Pray for me and wait for me as soon you and my daughter get rich  
These days for me T.I. made a way for me  
And Jason had a place for me  
Doug on the case with me plus Hannah they makin' me straight  
They knew I'm ghetto but I got what it takes  
See the PSC without me, they fake, my niggas  
God is my witness and I'm cryin' the time I'm living  
But I will never give up walkin' to my rhythm, like wat?  
Hear me cry, it's like mmm, mmm, mmm  
Hear the shots they like boom, boom, boom  
Heads high at the moon, moon, moon  
And when we die, it's like soon, soon, soon  
Hear me cry, it's like mmm, mmm, mmm  
Hear the shots they like boom, boom, boom  
Heads high at the moon, moon, moon  
And when we die, it's like soon, soon, soon  
I never talked about this but now is the time  
I tried to let it go but this shit destroyed my mind  
My homie, his momma dying and his baby daughter, she blind  
She got no one to play with nuttin' but a daughter that's mine  
I'm takin' more than time, Lord, hurry, they killed Brian  
And plus they killing kids, hurry up, 'fore they kill mine  
Killing time, lately there's a funeral, I'm soon to go  
Young Dro, bless me in peace and look at the moon blow  
Thinking about wen my daddy got high and I had my room closed  
Broke, I can't survive winter wearing these June clothes  
Blooms slow up with flower, I'll die in hours  
The water gone off but I'm cool, my tears shower me  
Hear me cry, it's like mmm, mmm, mmm  
Hear the shots they like boom, boom, boom  
Heads high at the moon, moon, moon  
And when we die, it's like soon, soon, soon  
Hear me cry, it's like mmm, mmm, mmm  
Hear the shots they like boom, boom, boom  
Heads high at the moon, moon, moon  
And when we die, it's like soon, soon, soon  
I'm finna cry man, call Quntay  
This shit hurt for real tip, call Donsay  
Tell him that I meant for one day  
For us to make shit, shawty that nig shot me up  
I couldn't take it  
Plus I had to wear a shit bag but I forgave him  
He shot me but God helped me fly off like a raven  
Don't hate him, pray for him  
Zayzay made a way for him, my homeboy died, yeah [Incomprehensible]  
All I got is faith, pimp and money from the seventies  
All kind of felonies, a playa like Bill Bellame  
I'ma go to heaven, nigga, fuck, wat y'all tellin' me  
Fuck it, I'ma stop rappin', shawty, sang this hear  
Hear me cry, it's like mmm, mmm, mmm  
Hear the shots they like boom, boom, boom  
Heads high at the moon, moon, moon  
And when we die, it's like soon, soon, soon  
Hear me cry, it's like mmm, mmm, mmm  
Hear the shots they like boom, boom, boom  
Heads high at the moon, moon, moon  
And when we die, it's like soon, soon, soon

Ladies and Gentlemen, this is a Jazze Phizzle production Young Drooo  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]  
Are you a killer? What it is  
Oh yeah, what it is  
Drug dealer, what it is  
Young player, riding's hard  
I just wanna sit up in the air  
Get high, I just wanna be up in the air  
  
I'm in the air (come down)  
Ain't coming down (why?)  
Up here dammit (where?)  
Ain't coming down (please)  
Bubbilish coat, twenty six's in the town  
I'm a killer too,  
Killing bitches in town  
Chevy with the beat down  
Make you spin around  
I could fishtail  
Off Fishdale  
Ask the niggas over there  
If I'm the shit there  
I don't tolerate  
My impala grape  
Bring the top out  
Bet I discombobulate  
I'm a tough nigga  
You a fuck nigga  
See me in the club all prodded up nigga  
I got a semi too  
My whole penny do  
I got diamonds, earned like Winnie Pooh  
Given talapia  
And caviar for dinner too  
Mafia as a mother fucker  
Don't make me have to get at you  
I throw a hundred shots  
Plus fifty-two  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]  
  
My car actually  
Willy Wonka factory  
Ice look like raspberry  
These hoes tryna tackle me  
Nigga I'm a killer I suggest you don't come after me  
Bitch I'll be in Collipark  
Plus I'll on Mcafee  
Bankhead faculty  
Boy you need to rap with me  
Come and talk to me  
Before I open up your cavity  
Shots come rapidly  
I told you not to mess with me  
I don't play with little boys  
You trying to Michael Jackson me?  
Know a nigga ride in the air fantastically  
Till their daddy kill somethin else  
I put my rims up  
Actually, car flop purple when the sun come  
When it get dark that thing  
It'll look Dro won  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]  
  
Mink coat  
Shit polar bear  
Hoes over here  
Hoes over there  
I'm about to take flight  
I'm goin' in the air  
Candy with the gloss  
I'm about to lift it off  
Can't you see someone on me you don't like  
And then lick it out  
We don't need to look at a town  
We rip em off  
My wrist forty  
Forget how much tip costs  
Buy a hundred k I don't wanna play  
Young Dro rides tall on a summer day  
Selling dope, it be junkies where my mama's day  
Bad hoes get treated like runaways  
Bitch you need to go home cool out and smoke a blunt today  
Go and say how my cutlass look like egg yolk  
I keep two with me all in the bed though  
My money fed though  
It's Grand Hustle bread boy  
We got twenty eight inches in the air  
What you scared for?  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]
