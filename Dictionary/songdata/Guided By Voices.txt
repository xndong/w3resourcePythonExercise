Oh, to speak on one's feet  
To beat on one's brain  
The popular mechanics are at it again  
A tenement filled with side-show freaks  
Assembled to downgrade  
An impeccable arrangement  
By the soft-rock renegades  
And give me time to light  
A sentimental torch tonight  
I'm a big fan of the pigpen  
  
Sharper than most  
Cut with exacto  
Gone is all good  
Ex post facto  
Ba-da-ba-da  
Oh, oh.

Pollards mumbling here  
Rings of blue and  
Rings of gold  
So many stories to be told  
It hurts be worse than it hurt you  
You realize now that's not true..oohh  
Amber, neon, wet concrete  
A well-worn track a smothering heat  
They curious pet in an open cage subjected  
To his masters rage. oohh  
A portait destroyed by fire  
A portait destroyed by fire  
A portait destroyed by fire  
A portait destroyed by fire  
A portait destroyed by fire  
A portait destroyed by fire  
A portait destroyed by fire  
A portait destroyed by fire  
A portait destroyed by fire  
  
  

Over the summer  
Somehow waiting, sometimes craving  
And I gave it all away  
Left my mind stripped away  
Kept everyone away  
  
I can't tell you anything you don't already know  
I can't tell you anything you don't already know  
I can't tell you anything  
  
I am the minister and the imposter  
You said I'm on my own  
Bu I am not alone  
You are the militant fighting to bring me home  
  
I can't tell you anything you don't already know  
I can't tell you anything you don't already know  
I can't tell you anything  
  
I can't tell you anything you don't already know

I can't terrorize I see terror in your eyes  
As we go up, we go down  
I can't socialize I'll be institutionalized  
As we go up, we go down  
  
And see the truth, yeah, is just a lie, oh  
And see the truth, yeah, is just a lie, oh  
  
I speak in monotone: "Leave my fucking life alone"  
As we go up we go down  
As we go up we go down (And see the truth yeah)  
As we go up we go down (Is just a lie)  
As we go up we go down (And see the truth yeah)  
As we go up we go down (Is just a lie)  
As we go up we go down (And see the truth yeah)  
As we go up we go down (Is just a lie)  
As we go up we go down (And see the truth yeah)

That girl sitting over there is defined as the world's finest Paramount
Pyramid.  
  
I met this  
Beekeeper seeks Ruth  
That kind of timing just isn't happening  
Not today, not on any day  
The flying party is here  
But the constellation is right  
For a lovely flight  
A special strategy for the warlocks to her  
And his magical flute will sing you the truth  
Beekeeper seeks Ruth  
Flying party is here  
Zookeeper keeps her  
Beekeeper seeks Ruth  
Zookeeper keeps her  
  
Hello James, the sun loves you  
Get your fear in gear  
The flying party is here  
Goodbye, I'm flying  
To meet brother monkey  
The timing just isn't happening, not today, not on any day  
Beekeeper seeks Ruth  
Zookeeper keeps her  
Zookeeper, zookeeper, zookeeper  
The flying party is here  
Flying party is here  
Oh-oh  
Flying party is here  
My ?? prevalent battle-shipped  

I have entered a shiny new realm  
A very different and very spoiled world  
It's with great pleasure I introduce myself  
To call and thank you for such delicious pie  
  
The irony is sweet - the bird is paralyzed  
With one good finger you try me on for size  
It's hard to imagine that you just wanna leave  
With yellow photos - pocket-size  
  
Revealing mobility, your psychedelic eye  
Spontaneous and violent but private to the mind  
With nowhere left to go  
  
Pass the word, the chicks are back  
The chicks are back, yeah  
The chicks are back  
Pass the word, the chicks are back  
The chicks are back, yeah  
The chicks are back  
  
The chandelier is spinning and shaking  
The fireball is already waking  
  
Revealing mobility, your psychedelic eye  
Spontaneous and violent but private to the mind  
With nowhere left to go  
  
Pass the word, the chicks are back  
The chicks are back, yeah  
The chicks are back  
Pass the word, the chicks are back  
The chicks are back, yeah  
The chicks are back

Blimps go 90 on with the show  
Couldnt you see that?  
Now didn't you know?  
Aerosol halos---films of the flag  
Rifle games for seven-year-olds  
What a drag  
Yeah now that's a drag  
  
This is not a vacation  
There is no place to go  
Weep, sad freaks of the nation  
Where blimps go 90  
And you can't find me  
  
Senator sipping on gentleman jack  
Oh boy they told me now don't you look back  
But don't you worry  
I promise to not  
Ill join your canary court  
Fit into the slot  
Say now what have you got?  
  
Oftentimes Im reminded  
Of the sweet young days  
When I poured punch for the franchise  
And thus was knighted  
Got so excited  
  
Blimps go 90 on with the show  
Couldnt you see that?  
Now didn't you know?  
Hey now didn't you know?

I played the part  
I played the start  
I made a table out of clay  
I placed my hands upon the plans  
I waited for a proud display  
I played around  
I heard the sound of certain trouble on the way  
  
I got bulldog skin  
  
I took a car  
I drove it far  
I dug the quality of steel  
I crashed my nerve  
I made it swerve  
I made it back - was no big deal  
I tasted blood  
A date with scud  
And now I don't know how to feel  
  
I got bulldog skin  
(Spark from the master)

Trailing off the likes of it  
She likes it when it grows  
Sending out a candidate  
She's sinking her foes  
Peaking out then leveling  
Wherever it goes  
  
And her mother will greet you  
And a river will reach you  
Breaking out to make you slave again  
  
Chasing Heather crazy  
Chasing Heather crazy  
Making sure that all the world is coming down  
All the world is coming down on her  
Anywhere I want to  
And if you want to come too  
We'll go down where  
All the girls are stumblin' round  
All the world is crumbling down around her  
  
Staring out from otherworldly windows painted red  
Doesn't have to listen to the voices in your head  
That's a different lie  
Do you remember what was said?

It's a storm  
Understand me  
They never will this  
All we do we do for you  
Shit gets old and demanding  
It never fails to amaze me  
When I see it all before me  
If I were a freak who self-destructs  
A ride for boys in monster trucks  
The painted sluts training monkey men  
I call to the door but they won't let me in  
And the human fly gets smashed again  
He mixes his blood with tonic and gin  
And I choke on the sheep stuck in the company of wolves  
As you raise up on your hind hooves  
Daylight breaks  
I see a face that used to cry  
Where were you then  
Somewhere off to yourself  
There's too many people involved in the game  

Chain smoke rings like a vapor snake kiss  
She says she don't know why  
The closer you are the quicker it hits you  
Closer you are the quicker it hits you  
Now you can see the boys dreaming, scheming  
  
You play the heavy  
It's a real slick movie move  
"Stoned at the Alamo" tonight  
The closer you are the quicker it hits you  
Try to be nice and look what it gets you  
Now you can see the boys dreaming, scheming

The color of my blade is red  
Remember what you said  
Perfection is killing the freaks yeah  
Even as we speak yeah  
Don't you  
Now it was decided the war  
The silence will rise to a shout yeah  
You told us we'd see it through  
The practical joker police came  
To knock down doors and to leave blame  
I remember what you told them  
The color of my blade is golden  
They didn't come back anymore  
You should've decided to lay it out on the floor  
Be sure to instruct them to leave you  
Cause they no longer would believe you  
It's worthless to you through  
Don't you come back anymore

Do you suppose she could change your life?  
If she could then I wish she would  
Do you suppose she could save my life?  
If she could then I think she should  
  
It's another busy day for the cut-out witch  
Silver threads for our heads need another stitch  
Golden needles in our eyes then we realize  
It's another busy day for the cut out witch  
  
And could she change this wrong into a right?  
Say pretty please and I think she might  
Cause if she won't then you'll fall and bust  
And turn to dust and so I think she must  
  
It's another busy day for the cut-out witch  
Silver threads for our heads need another stitch  
Golden needles in our eyes then we realize  
It's another busy day for the cut-out witch  
  
Do you think she can change your life?  
Do you think she can change your life?  
Do you think she can change your life?

Standing on solid soil  
Coping with raging wars  
Once I was young and wired  
Now I am old and tired  
  
Waiting, hoping for a change  
  
Haven't I seen you before  
Standing outside my door,  
Racing through space and time  
Without a reason or rhyme?  
  
Waiting, hoping for a change  
  
Only on to open skies  
Running away  
Looking for a new way to rise  
Rolling away  
  
Standing on solid soil (x3)

Difficult outburst and breakthrough  
Something bombastic to make you change  
Your point of view until you focus on  
Anything new  
  
Difficult outburst and breakthrough  
Something bombastic to make you change  
Your point of view before you focus on  
Anything new  
  
Presenting by the dangerous general public  
Transferring her to transhumantic system city  
Have you no pity  
Where is your rifle?  
  
Guns and [?] exploring through microscope eyes  
  
Difficult outburst and breakthrough  
Something bombastic to make you change  
Your point of view until you focus on  
Anything new

Here's a picture from the house of meat  
Are you the person I'm scheduled to meet  
To assess my skeleton's worth?  
Do the earth  
Curtains open and the guests are fried  
In my attempt to seem dignified  
I re-enact my birth  
Do the earth  
do the earth I wanna ramble in opium fields  
Playing tricks on the invasion boys  
Penetrator like a space invader - do the earth  
Do the earth- this tear will never wash away  
On any human sanitation day  
And I will starve to death and wither away  
Unless you feed me  
I'm too tired to run from the tiger  
I'm too dumb to hide in the bushes  
I'm a human costume with veins of gold  
I'll face the punching bag - do what I'm told  
Til I get old and have to dwell  
In the valley of the ironman  
do the earth -- you beckon me and leave it up to fate  
You offer salvation and I salivate  
And the thought of my next free cheese  
Hear the voice  

I don't know where I've come from  
I don't know where I'm off to  
And I need to find a way out  
And he's here to help me find it  
  
Exit Flagger  
Exit Flagger  
Exit Flagger  
Exit Flagger  
I'm not going to race you today  
  
I need a life the same as  
And I don't believe in anything  
I promise to leave you one of these days  
I promise it'll be real soon.  
  
Exit Flagger  
Exit Flagger  
Exit Flagger  
Exit Flagger  
I'm not going to race you today  
  
I promise to leave you  
I promise to leave you  
I promise to leave you  
I promise to leave you

It isn't quite ready, it's almost 5:30  
Scholars and flunkees  
Faggots and junkies  
Incinerator in a blood red sky  
Kill the head and the body will die  
I can't tell you that I'm happy  
But I can tell you that my clothes are snappy  
It's time to draw the line  
Superman died tonight  
Ate a pound of Kryptonite  
Drank a quart of brotherly love  
Fell straight from the sky above  
And if there's a hell below  
Kenneth Ray ain't gonna go  
He lost his soul in the Korean War  
I lost my concentration when he opened the door  
It's time to draw the line  

Finger, finger, finger, finger,  
Finger, finger, finger, finger,  
Finger gang.  
Finger, finger, finger, finger,  
Finger, finger, finger, finger,

Hey, glad girls only want to get you high  
And they're alright  
There will be no coronation  
There will be no flowers flowing  
In the light that passes though me  
Hey, glad girls only want to get you high  
And they're alright  
There will be no graduation  
There will be no trumpets blowing  
In the light that passes through me  
With the sinking of the sun  
I've come to greet you  
Clean your hands and go to sleep  
Confess the dreams  
Of good and bad men all around  
Some are lost  
And some have found  
The light that passes though me  
  

I'm sitting on 2 heads  
  
" some seat" I heard some said  
  
Just waiting for sunday  
  
Four days after wednesday  
  
The higher clouds are closing in  
  
To hide the deeds of fertile jim  
  
Could this be a brand new low  
  
One that we can't talk about  
  
One that we can't live without  
  
One that we can join in now  
  
I'm standing on 2 feet  
  
Now buried in concrete  
  
Just waiting for sundown  
  
So as to be not found  
  
The higher clouds...

If I waited for you to signify the moves that I should make  
I'd be on the take  
Gold star for robot boy  
Well then that's okay  
  
If I waited for you to show me a the actions that I should take  
I would I get my break?  
Gold star for robot boy  
  
And it's one thing  
And its something to do the robot boy yeah  
  
If I waited for lessons in true confessions  
That could take all day  
But I'm here to stay  
Gold star for robot boy  
Well then that's my move  
  
Well then that's my move  
Well then that's my move  
But it's one thing  
But its something to do the robot boy yeah

Gather around  
See is mine  
Disappear that man  
Often distant  
She's laid out by solution  
In the bad talent tv  
She's off in the distance, babe  
And she's waiting for me  
  
I am Columbus  
The prince can take us  
I'm taking it back  
I'm taking the wine  
A secret goal  
Take it back  
When we appear inside  
Made out of purpose  
There are silent tides  
Of you and me thinking, babe  
It's closer to past fiends  
I'm re(?)  
I am Columbus  
Admittedly animal  
I live on uncertainty  
Got well with your last  
  
And he's never around  
The point of direction  
The purpose of town  
Paths to resurrection  
Paths to resurrection  
Paths to resurrection

There's some food upon the table, boys  
And if you have ever seen me flying  
Then you know that I am weak  
And you are free to take me downstairs  
Away from cares  
I'll be with you in the morning, boys  
Cause you know that if we wait for our time  
We'll all be dead  
  
Oh now I'll bore you, crying my life away  
Don't I know it, always the things I say  
Always too far  
If you could be anything that you want to be,  
do you think that you would be who you see in the mirror?  
If I look long enough, my face would start to change  
If I look close enough, I'll take away the pain  
Oh I don't care anymore  
Anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore  
  
I'll be with you in the morning, boys  
Cause you know that if we wait  
For our time  
Then we'll be there  

Cling to the sides, brain-boy  
we lost our numb-er selves in jail  
leaving a groovy wit matter on a sailing sky,  
alive and jabberstroking,  
sinking around you now  
around you now  
around you now  
sinking around you now  
around you now  
around you now  
  
Wings are wise, lame-boy  
louder people build a fighting bore  
dig the fast track, fucker,  
ancenstral public dig the fast track!  
  
He's the one with the talkin' rock-bull,  
clings to edge of the pool,  
Greg Case  
Examine number one  
at cause and at manners  
bounded to protect, a fighting bully  
go around you now  
around you now  
around you now  
sinking full, around you now  
around you now  
around you now  
  
On a silent sky  
dig the fast track

dig the fast track fucker  
think of a wide lane, boy  
dig the fast track  
promise you will go and fight  
dig the fast track, fucker

dig the fast track for her  
dig the fast trip

Jane of the waking universe!  
A wrinkled rose snapped back  
And the flies on flowers spreading out  
To all sickness of humanity  
Listen to our queen as she is offering free samples  
Of her lovely garden spoils  
Jane of the waking universe  
And undulating always like the tide  
The devil's bride is calling all toward her skirt  
And in the loving folds there we will hide inside  
From any would be sneak attack  
Until it's safe to journey back  
Jane of waking universe

Feel, listen like no one  
Uses dancing, uses dancing  
Mere strings and private strikes  
Uses dancing, uses dancing  
  
Seers through his head  
These words, are looking down  
Through his head As I'm moving the future  
For dancing, for dancing  
  
Jeeper stoner under his eyes  
Uses dancing, uses dancing  
Reed and wooden steel eyes  
Uses dancing, uses dancing  
  
The prays mourn hollow cries  
Uses dancing, uses dancing  
I fear masses are coming in  
As I'm talking to mountains

Oh, baby -- this is the land of danger (each and every home a battlefield)  
Oh, baby -- this is the throat of a stranger (searching for the blood  
That's now congealed)  
Oh, baby -- this is a thick muddy mystery (tearing at the pages of our past)  
Oh, baby -- this is the straight path of history (human motion -- land and  
Ocean)  
Try to run, try to hide  
It's been a long, long, long, long long, long [long] time  
[It's been a long, long, long, long, long time]  
Oh, baby -- this is the fresh flesh of anger (calling out for action in the  
Streets)  
Oh, baby -- this is a slow running canker (opened up by victories and defeats)  
Oh, baby -- this is the night of the dancer (dancing on a time bomb in my
head)  
Oh, baby -- this is the ultimate cancer (human notion -- fear in motion)  
Try to run, try to hide  
It's been a long, long, long, long long, long [long] time  
[It's been a long, long, long, long, long time]  
[Don't tell me everything's gonna work out anymore  
Don't tell me everything's gonna work out anymore]  
[Of danger, of danger, of danger, of danger]  
[Don't tell me everything's gonna work out]  

You were a child reaching out brave and true  
For big thins in the next room  
And I couldn't step into such open sky  
Where on the crest of uncertainty you loom  
I'm learning to hunt for you  
Say that you'll never run too far away  
Even with all the answers out there  
Where it's brighter but no one will care  
Half as much as I care about you  
I'm learning to hunt for you  
(back inside ordinary)  

He's a long distance man  
And he keeps on going because its not worth blowing  
And he does what he can because it not worth losing and  
There ain't no choosin  
Any other world that you live in  
Don't believe in second chance  
Sell another dream he won't take it  
So don't fake it when you dance  
Cover up your eyes in these bad times for  
The sad times passing years build another tower  
For your freedom he don't need them shed no tears.  
For the long distance man.....  
  

Got my flashlight  
Two by four  
Necessary precaution  
Plants at the entrance  
Flies at the exit  
Way down deep  
In the darkest hole  
Lost my way  
Lost my soul  
You can dig my grave  
In Mammoth Cave  
I would of brought a sharp object, yeah  
But they've taken mine all away  
All away  
I pretended I wasn't scared  
Something fucking stinks in here  
Like a sump pump in a sewer  
What the hell was I thinking?  
Way down deep  
In the darkest hole  
Lost my way  
Lost my soul  
You can dig my grave  
You can dig me a hole  
In the Mammoth Cave  
Mammoth Cave.  

The white line of tracers  
For the facers of the aftermath  
Positioned in the situation  
Lost in battles of love  
Not learning not returning  
Unborn unhatched  
Yeah but wait  
It's time to collide  
To decide, if you will  
A purpose for the marchers in orange  
Still circus for the children in disguise  
Throwing bones to the drug-sniffing dogs  
Projecting what we've come to know as ours  
For the colors we wear in our dreams  
For the flags we fly in our films  

I won't put that in my mouth no  
It is a fright with that neon light  
The hollywood magic men  
Back up in their caves  
Ooh at the raves  
And the?? Cake?? Can't say  
The weepers from the way  
Baby it's all right  
The night is long and cold as ice  
But it's all right, baby it's all right  
There's a pink little area  
The regions of my disease  
And it is good  
It is good  
Mice feel nice  
Ooh mice feel nice  
You know mice feel nice ooh

Mincer ray don't worry  
If the road's a little worn  
It's a cold and filthy cavern  
That we're traveling on  
richer day assured me  
Of the weak-link mending plan  
Danger's always there to follow  
Just do the best you can  
And a light shines down...  
mincer ray don't worry  
If the road's a little worn  
It's a cold and filthy cavern  
That we're traveling on  
And a light shines down  
And a light shines down..  
  

You told me you'd give your soul to the crowd  
You run to the edge of the warzone  
You're finding out that it's way too late  
To be happy around your friends  
You changed your head  
And made your bed  
Through time, circumstances and medicines  
You lied a lot  
Created a plot  
To escort you safely away  
Chorus: My impression now  
My impression now  
Stand on the edge of the ledge  
Jump off cause nobody cares  
You told me you found a way to escape  
Through silence and not a suggestion  
To apply it all to everyday life  
But it can't find the connection  
The magic lens  
You contacted friends  
Who just never seem to be with you  
Flying up on a paper cup  
They land to s-sailing away  
Chorus  
Chorus  

(cough cough)  
The para-coats are coming  
When we open fire from the fear  
We realize we're never really here  
  
None of them any good  
None of them any good  
None of them any good  
  
Re-crystalizing mansions were visual and real  
But when they moved in for the pillage  
There was no crystal village  
None of them any good  
None of them any good  
None of them any good  
  
Waits for a line  
It was quite groovy  
A miscue in the greatest movie  
Doing my scenes  
Of course you should  
Not one of them was any good  
None of them any good  
None of them any good  
None of them any good  
  
None of them any good  
None of them any good  
None of them any good  
  

Militant babies came to me  
And tole me don't be afraid to try  
Phenomenal stuntkids in the street  
Popping out of the black ghost pie (it pleases the chef)  
Fearless ones-cracked up jack and jill  
They're down there in the bunker still  
You look like a sniper anyway  
I'm not behind the fighter jet  
I'd much rather back a simple girl  
I've seen your plan and it's all wet  
A noseload of prophecies coming to me  
Caught in the trap where bravery steps  
A wounded mercenary bleeds  
In the hall of fantastically fine things  
Where the path of glory leads  
Lately I think it's grown too hard  
Coming up with the winning card  
But who's gonna beat them in their own backyard  
(a motion to remove the entire staff.  
Don't forget the double crossing crew)  

Old Friend in your room  
With your ticker  
Feeling thicker  
You get sicker, but  
DieHard  
DieHard  
DieHard  
DieHard  
Old Friend in this World  
With your crucifix  
You think it's fixed  
And yet you  
DieHard  
DieHard  
DieHard  
DieHard  
To heal you we have love  
To heal you we have love  
To heal you we have love  
I don't wanna  
I don't wanna  
I don't wanna  
I don't wanna  
To heal you we have love  
To heal you we have love  
To heal you we have love  
I don't wanna  
I don't wanna  
I don't wanna  
I don't wanna  

Meet me at the market  
Where you bought me out  
Closely examine  
The contact point of the  
Opposing rams  
  
Now we are playing optical hopscotch  
  
Now we are over here  
Sketching the field of the spies  
  
Front me a coroner's allotment  
I'll not fail to return  
An exact earth pinprick  
  
Now we are engaged in optical hopscotch  
  
What's left of our vision?  
Our swimming vision?  
Of what division?  
  
Look!  

After clearing his throat  
The speaker read from the manuscript  
"Only forty-percent of all participants have remained alcoholic."  
And we began to discuss amongst ourselves  
The possibility for a dream-filled holiday  
Order for the new slave trade  
New flag blowing  
We've used up our minds  
We had no way of knowing  
Old flag burning  
We've lost our souls  
There'll be no returning  
We've diverted back  
To the stretch rack  
Only this time  
We won't snap back  
While crossing the parking lot  
A stranger approached me  
Handed me a gun  
He said meet me in the ashes  
Of the old city  
And we're bound.....  
To have.....  
Some fun.  

Don't you call me up  
To tell me that you're lonely  
I won't make things up  
To tell you that they're only for you  
Cause that wouldn't make you feel any different about me  
Without me  
A message to the paper girl  
Don't fall apart so easily  
Don't cry too much you'll get all wet  
And that don't make much sense to me you see  
Cause that would mend my heart and I won't feel blue  
That's not true  
I need more but it's not like me to fuss  
With the problems of us  
When it's likely to be ??in this state with me??  
But here I go again  
And the paper girl's gonna blow away  
And it's one game that I won't play for you  
For you and me  

Give me the cost of the albatross  
And wear it 'round your neck for size  
Don't let it get you down  
I'm looking inside your house  
And oh and it smells so nice  
Your house always looks so nice  
maybe they're twice as high laughing  
Maybe the time is right you know  
Promise me not to leave  
I'm looking inside your brain  
And christ, it's a cluttered mess  
I love you, I must confess  
la la la la la...  

Come on over tonight  
We'll put on some Catt Butt and  
Do it up right  
No need to get all caught up  
In societies stipulations  
You're a member of the freak generation  
You're gonna burn to have delation  
When the pendulum swings it cuts  
When the big door swings open and shuts  
Yeah, we'll be middle-age children  
But so what  
I haven't changed so drastically  
They can talk so sarcastically  
They'll bust up  
But we''ll bust in  
Get my down back up again  
When the pendulum swings it cuts  
When the big door swings open and shuts  
Ohhhh, we'll be swollen ?  
But so what  
When the pendulum swings it cuts  
When the big door swings open and shuts  
Yeah, we'll be middle-children  
But so what  
Ohhhh, we'll be swollen  
But so what.  

Picture me big time  
Up along the range  
With this woman of mine  
Driving me insane  
  
Parasites baby....  
Don't you know  
I can't lie to you  
  
There was a band from Beantown  
They drove the now sound  
With a girl at the top of her lungs now  
Yeah, a girl at the top of her lungs  
  
She'd tell the people baby  
The world will settle down for no one  
I will deliver to you  
  
To one another in every place  
Who speak like brothers  
And leave no trace  
Of a world still divided by tongues  
Yeah, the world's still divided by tongues  
  
You want to keep it closer now,  
don't you  
But there are words that speak to everyone  
Which I will deliver to you  
I will deliver to you  
I will deliver to you

Pivotal film  
Showing cloaks of rubber  
Digital relay  
Fingers stroking  
Like mechanical lover  
Critical rooms  
Transparent scenes shifting  
Pivotal film  
Selling out your monkey  
Sinful heroes  
Stabbing, choking  
(They must be joking)  
Like mechanical lover  
Critical rooms  
Transparent scenes shifting  
Grotesque and arrogant  
Perfect for the experts  
Top gold  
It's cold in the morning  
Where scenesters exit  
Into thin air  
  

You could have gotten to know  
In the tinted snow  
And let the coast emotions  
That I haven't seen in some months  
  
The hidden spirit  
Will make the mount to ghost town  
Slow down! To the planet scope  
And if you promised to turn up  
  
You're just not here anymore  
And let the spectators abolish  
Until the buildings form beyond  
You only need us to be us  
  
And make the best of downtown  
Till we run town  
Let the planet scope  
Let the records score

Noticing the change we are taking time  
Everybody knows everybody's fine  
And we'll figure out our purpose in the end  
Unless we have to jump, unless we have to swim  
  
Hold you tongue, brace yourself  
Give me a kiss show me what I miss  
  
Can I find a phone can I drop a dime  
Can I get a loan, runing out of time  
And I've have a toast to what it's all about  
[unknown]  
  
Hold you tongue brace yourself  
Give me a kiss you show me what I miss  
[unknown]  
  
Postal blowfish

Strikes me as an animal  
And now gone kissing  
But soon be missing home  
And waving at waterfalls  
Too strong not to mention  
With tempting extensions unknown  
  
Oh, this time I really mean that  
A cracking coat where I dig that  
Oh, this time I want to keep it alone  
Oh, this time I really trust you  
But it can't belong to anyone  
And I'd be so sad if I lost it  
  
And the courage seekers  
Of the aborted logos  
Of declaration "no-go" are gone  
But I'll keep a light for 'em  
Hold down the fort for 'em  
And wear my maroon blazer all the time

Cover your eyes, the light is too bright  
Your wisemen, they tell you lies  
And what's worse - they curse  
But still I love the bite  
Like flies or maybe mothmen  
As they're attracted to the light - they realize  
The night has come to baptize  
And they will finally realize  
And what's worse - it hurts  
But still they love the bite  
  
And I would like to die with you  
I'd like to try but I'm not suicide  
And I would like to kill you  
But that would suit you fine, I realize  
And I will not disgrace myself  
By chasing you around to pull you back  
And I will not give in an inch  
You win before the fight begins  
But it's o.k. I'm over you  
  
I'm over you  
I'm over you  
I'm over you  
  
Cover your eyes  
The light is too bright

With surgical focus  
She stared at me and said  
?I'm willing to reach out  
Get in to your head?  
And I will keep you and cleanse you  
She glared at me and wept  
A change is not going to hurt you  
Not this time  
And I've been waiting in line for this  
Now that it's taken forever I insist  
Until I get it I can't breathe  
Climbing high upon the rocky cliffs she flies  
With surgical focus, with surgical focus  
With surgical focus  
She stared at me and said  
I'm willing to reach out  
Get in to your head  
And I will keep you and cleanse you  
She glared at me and wept  
A change is not going to hurt you  
Not this time  
And I've been waiting in line for this  
Now that it's taken forever I insist  
Until I get it I can't breathe  
Climbing high upon the rocky cliffs she flies  
With surgical focus, with surgical focus  
Well, I've been waiting in line for this  
Now that it's taken forever I insist  
Until I get it I can't breathe  
Climbing high upon the rocky cliffs she flies  
With surgical focus, with surgical focus  
With surgical focus  
With surgical focus  
With surgical focus  
...  

Someone tell me why  
I do the things that I don't want to do  
When you're around me, I'm somebody else  
Someone tell me why I act like a fool  
When things don't go my way  
When you're around me, I'm somebody else  
  
There is good reason I guess  
Having once gone too far  
When you clean out the hive  
Does it make you want to cry  
Are you still being followed by the teenage FBI  
  
Someone tell me why [x2]

I don't come around  
Never call or let her know  
I got a life of my own  
You know I hate to be around her  
When she's like that  
I wrote a song once about her  
Called "The Brides Have Hit Glass"  
You know it just won't last  
To be on top of your own world  
With no guardrails to cling to  
You fall so very fast  
It's very odd to find her up again  
Staking out expansion  
Seeking new exposure  
And when she holds out an empty glass  
And she comes for a handout  
I ask for the same thing-it's sad  
And I hold on so sure I can take all she can  
Just to be around her  
Just to feel bad  
One day I will know  
That's it's a waste of time  
And there's a better road ahead of me  
I just don't know how to make it there  
So I'll just hang around and take my chance  
Once again I'll roll the dice  
And try to hang on to my shrinking paradise  
And I'll hold out an empty glass  
And I'll come for a handout  
And I'll ask for the same thing-it's sad  
And I'll hold on so confident  
That's it all I can give  
To try to find my way back  
Just to hit glass  

Mother, feeling your hand I  
Believe you and I did then  
And mother, release every bad seed  
The geese are leaving the trees  
  
Exposed to winter's cold  
They waited too long  
But we too exaggerated  
And I take the cake away  
It's a long song  
And I can play it so  
Give me a pick now collector of bones  
  
Words of smoke  
Distorted, never broken  
Paradise is open but I choke  
One of these days when I see through the smoke  
That'll be the day I get the joke  

??Roses before sign??  
This one pushed his weight  
??Day the chain??  
Dogs barking, the sign flashing  
Come one and all to the execution  
Shot shot bang go  
??clothing?? to films we  
??Die string to sadist??(I have no clue here)  
And pirate's coffee  
Computer ??the fat birds??  
??Loafing on bringlers??  
Floating on a leg  
Pissing from a keg  
The future is in eggs, the future is in eggs  
Spying without ??chim??  
Choking out a grin  
??Splitting?? kids in cub scout suits  
Are crushed by marching army boots  
Their fearless leader on his back  
??Cut?? from a cocaine heart attack  
You knew we had to go  
It's an ordinary show  
The movie of the year  
Stars realistic beer  
Billy says something  
??Act?? what is does  
There's ??pervertically?? nothing  
To help you and me  
Here is my human machine  
With incredible mileage  
??Invective?? and clean  
You kids aren't smiling, smiling,...  
And all the coalition, no nutrition  

Mannnnn.....  
There's a whale outta water  
Whoaaaa.....  
There's a bone on a string  
Doing everything the hard way x2  
Stilllll.....  
There's ? for the wicked  
??? (weak-kneed and ...?)  
Go to pale the hard way x2  
Sort it out in the animal sea  
The factor of the human pride  
The place where I was born  
The place where my father died  
Past the police there's an army  
Marching like stone guards from Hell  
Into the wishing well the hard way  
Wishing well the hard way  
Doing everything the hard way x7  
We're doing everything the hard way.  

Bitter fish in crude oil sea  
You don't have to bother me  
You just have to join in on this song  
  
Crawling people on your knees  
Don't take this so seriously  
You just have to hum it all day long  
  
To dine alone  
To build a private zone  
Or trigger a synapse  
And free us from our traps  
  
You won't see me turn my back  
With my head against my stack  
Spitting teeth and breaking open skin  
  
Official ironmen you are free  
Champions officially  
But you won't catch me on an open chin  
  
To dine alone  
To build a private zone  
Or trigger a synapse  
And free us from our traps  
  
Save your knock-out punches for the freaks  
Happy little babies with red cheeks  
You will rock them gently out of sync  
  
Confirmations through the wire  
Spitting gas into the fire  
Am I also worthy of a drink?  
  
To dine alone  
To build a private zone  
Or trigger a synapse  
And free us from our traps

Hey go  
Quick, be off, be sinking  
Lown down whale the navy wing  
It clears out congested arenas  
They sell rocking host balloons  
And they're celebrating children  
And the weeping circus  
  
And the smoking-nosed robot  
Tasted blackens the sticks  
Like clowns from a fire, the albatross winks  
Faked to the back goes right wing shield  
All in a day's work  
  
We met at one of the Kinks' yeah  
We could come from the inner circle  
Of the dry ??  
Until it is just one trap  
One threaded ??

Coded-ancient the crease  
Unlock the timers  
And strike the chimers  
In my sleep  
  
Grab the coat - steal the fleece  
From behind the curtain  
It will most certainly  
Bring peace  
  
To those with countless numbers  
No cold or hot  
Like things that I will keep  
And hide them in my sleep  
  
Coded ancient  
Oh brightness we shall see  
Loaded up and at night when  
We shall flee  
Not to tread through the  
Heavy life  
Sink in the dream  
On the right night  
You'll find her waiting  
  
Selling things for cheap  
The things that I will keep  

Time machines escape the fall  
But cannot climb the prison wall  
Nowhere to go they stumble headlong  
Stumbling back to where they belong  
Are you looking at my signs?  
Have you noticed they're no timelines?  
Can you examine them sometimes?  
Can you?  
Time machines colliding  
Back and forth reuniting  
No real chance to run away  
No noble voices beckon them  
Have you looked at what I've found?  
In the ocean where my thoughts drown  
Can you walk on it sometimes?  
Can you?  
Time machines, we'll buy them  
I'll ride them with you  
In the dreams of every page  
And phases we go through  
Are you coming to meet with us?  
Will you be taking a seat with us  
At any time in the future or the past?  
Is there no one to care for you?  
With any crosses to bear for you?  
Or is the light always there for you fading fast  

To remake the young flyer  
Yes we must define his high desire  
Stand erect and not detect  
The anythings that we could not admire  
  
From a long line of high men  
Number one, is that the one to send?  
To restore all the trial  
This and then the national pride so proud  
  
A question to the lunatic  
Does your day seem like night?  
Does your world go to heaven?  
  
Gallant men dash forth  
He takes his place  
He ends the laughter of the slaughter daughters  
Takes his softness from his hand and goes  
  
To remake the young flyer  
Yes we must define his high desire

I'm of to work again  
There goes Mario Andreddy  
She's a real believer  
In getting there first everytime  
  
The first shall be the last  
And the last shall be the first  
Until next time  
  
Well, you're unbelievable  
In the mystic air  
Was it just not in your cause  
It seems so unfair!  
  
So line 'em up  
Shine 'em up and get them prepared  
You're the next generation  
  
The first shall be the last  
And the last shall be the first  
Until next time

Long Live Rockathon  
Offspring and Tag alongs were finding  
The history book has lost its binding  
Pages everywhere  
Two Titans without care will read them  
We conjure ghosts and then we feed them  
And if it all goes well we'll laugh a lot  
And then we'll all take photographs  
Of what we made..lemonade  
Freedomcake quick to bake  
Trim the tree collectively  
Breath the air from the fair  
And watch colored lights shine down  
Dancing round the lady's face  
As we learned the sound  
We can('t?) keep this violent pace  
Though we know that haste makes waste  
And I'm giving you a ring  
For the dreams of the weedking we all sing  

We fly higher then at first we imagined,  
We came over for the spin of a globe,  
Spanning rivers as the fish eggs were hatching,  
? pulse of the ?  
Come visit our world,  
See what goes down  
Explore new horizons  
Fall to the ground  
how does it feel? X6  
How do you feel?  
  
Tired busses on an abandoned old highway  
Taking kisses??of a gun  
Broken bottles on the top of the stairway  
Monuments of those we love most  
how does it feel? X6  
How do you feel? X2  
how does it feelX3  
(Unclear about fade)  

Come now Antoine give me your hand  
I will fly you across the land  
You were nobody  
Now you're somebody  
We will search for the dream of the king  
And friends will hate us  
And you will lead us  
You can't change the plan when it's made  
But we have changed it  
Chorus: Die for your freedom while you can  
You can always use new blood  
??Sing me Lila negation cow??  
??Fish will follow with eyes man??  
Hand on my shoulders  
March with true soldiers  
And in fact dear the flesh is no more  
Was burnt for our savior  
Offensive behavior  
And the last whale will swim to the shore  
And the new land of danger  
Chorus  

Standing around  
Hoping everything works out  
'Cause I want them all to work out  
You were always so in love with the truth  
Why did you change?  
Why did you land?  
  
[Chorus:]  
Look at the photograph  
Nothing is real  
Spend another lonely life  
With nothing to feel  
  
Was it something  
In the stories everyone told you?  
You needn't heed them  
Maybe you should read them  
Go back to where you came from  
Why did you land?  
You couldn't have stayed in flight forever  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Why did you land?  
Why did you land?  
Why did you land?  
Why did you land?  
Why did you land?

"Wished I was a giant" said  
"Man get off the street!"  
Spoken like a traffic cop  
Cronies at his feet  
Turned on his radio and picked up the noise  
Age rules with reason  
and who's to disagree?  
Not Mr. Spit with his abrupt delivery  
And Mr. Intelligent is just a wannabe like me  
And who makes the breakfast?  
And who gasses the truck?  
The same little bee that stung the bull  
And caused the bull to buck  
Only a matter of time before we have to pay  
If you were 10 years younger  
And I was a sunbeam  
"Wished I Was A Giant" said  
"Man, it's just a dream"  
Only a matter of time before we have to pay...  

I am an earthworm following  
There is a nighthawk watching  
me crawling  
La la la la -  
  
it's a lonely night  
I'll take the airwaves home tonight  
crawl with me in to the hole  
Where everyone can hide  
  
We're in the wormhole  
Seeking to be safe again  
Without a single brave soul  
Leaking out tonight  
  
After the fires there's a falling rain  
Washing us free of the daily pain  
Off the hook and down the drain  
And out to the other side  
  
To where the soil is rich and muddy in the riverbed  
Feed on the urgent promise  
Of the dead tonight
