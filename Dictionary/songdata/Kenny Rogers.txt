I see the town  
Where we were born,  
I see the place  
We were raised,  
  
I see all the things you wanted  
That I never gave.  
I see sadness,  
I see sorrow,  
  
I see pain in your face,  
But I just can't see  
A stranger in my place.  
  
I can see now where we quarrelled,  
I can see now I was wrong,  
I can see where you might weaken  
  
When I wasn't strong.  
I see memories of a love gone bad  
That time cannot erase,  
But I just can't see a stranger in my place.  
  
No one seems to know you quite like I do,  
No one knows the thigs that make you cry.  
Looking back it seems  
I never showed you,  
  
And now I lay alone and wonder why.  
I can see now  
Where you might grow tired of dreams  
That don't come true,  
  
I can see where I have fallen short  
Of the things I promised you.  
I can see mow through my tear filled eyes no love on your face,  
I must get used to seein' strangers in my place.

We used to think our love would be a fantasy  
But things don't always turn out loud  
There supposed to be, hearts can break  
And I won't surrender with so much at stake  
After all this time  
Did you think I let you slip away from me?  
Girl, we've come too far  
Just to turn our love into a memory  
Did you think that I can push you aside?  
All that we've been through  
Me and you, never give a try  
After all this time  
Easy to turn and walk away when love goes wrong  
Harder to stay and work it out but if the love is strong  
We must choose to hold on to something  
We don't wanna lose  
After all this time  
Did you think I let you slip away from me?  
Girl, we've come too far  
Just to turn our love into a memory  
Did you think that I can push you aside?  
All that we've been through  
Me and you, never give a try  
After all this time  

A little baby's born, daddy's up and gone  
You see his mama cry  
Don't you turn away, she's needing you today  
To help her dry her eyes  
  
All God's lovely children  
Sometimes lose their ways  
All God's lovely children  
Need your love today  
  
Met a little man, reaching out his hand  
He's reaching out for you  
Won't you take his hand? Help him understand  
And try to see him through  
  
All God's lovely children  
Sometimes lose their ways  
All God's lovely children  
Need your love today  
  
People  
People  
People  
People  
  
Love my people, it's right in the steeple  
It's in your heart and in your hands  
Open up your heart, reach out your hands  
And then you'll begin to understand  
  
Why all God's lovely children  
Sometimes lose their ways  
All God's lovely children  
Need your love today

Sometimes when I'm down and alone  
I feel just like a child with out a home  
The love you give me keeps me hangin' on, honey  
All I ever need is you  
  
Your my first love, your my last  
Your my future, your my past  
Oh loving you is all I ask, honey  
All I ever need is you  
  
Winters come and then they go  
And we watch the melting snow  
Sure summer follows spring, all the things you do  
Give me a reason to build my world around you  
  
Some men follow rainbows I am told  
Some men search for silver, some for gold  
But I found my treasures in my soul  
And all I ever need is you  
  
Without love I'd never find the way  
Through ups and downs of every single day  
And I won't sleep at night until you say  
Honey, all I ever need is you  
  
La, La, La, La, La, La  
The love you give me keeps me hangin' on  
Honey, all I'll ever need is you  
  
La, La, La, La, La, La  
But I found my treasures in my soul  
Honey, and all I ever need is you  
  
La, La, La, La, La, La

Are you sure I haven't loved you somewhere before?  
In another time, another place, on some distant shore  
You know me so well, better than I know myself  
  
And you'll love me tonight  
Like you've loved me all my life, all my life  
And with the touch of your hand  
You took me farther than I've never been  
You'll love me like, you've loved me all my life  
  
Love like we made could have taken a lifetime to find  
But you found the way to my heart in a moment of time  
You know how to care just like you've always been there  
  
And you'll love me tonight?

A star up in the sky will never know  
How lovely is the light that shines below  
It's always there, it never fades  
Without its magic light  
How would we find our way?.  
  
And you don't know how beautiful you are  
If your eyes could see the love that's in your heart  
Then you would know, what everybody sees  
That beautiful is all that you could be.  
  
What did I feel or think was true  
I can't remember before loving you  
You've shown me all that love can be  
As beautiful as you are  
It still amazes me.  
  
That you don?t know ...

Always and forever, each moment with you  
It's just like a dream to me that somehow came true  
And I know tomorrow will still be the same  
Cos we got a life of love that won't ever change.  
  
Every day lend me your own special way  
Melt my heart away with a smile  
Take time to tell me you really care  
And we'll share tomorrow together.  
  
There's always be sunshine when I look at you  
It's something I can't explain just the things that you do  
If you get lonely, call me and take  
A second to give to me the magic you make.  
  
Every day ...  
I'll always love you .....forever  
Every day ....  
Baby, baby, baby, I'll love you forever  
I'll always love you forever  
Together, forever.

Dusty dreams of yesterday, of women in the snow  
Always leavin' and always gone  
Reachin' for the sparkle in the yello' afternoon  
Always leavin' and always gone  
Always leavin' and always go-o-one  
Always gone  
  
The image of the girl appears there, clearly upon my mind  
Always leavin' and always gone  
Lost among the promises of the days I'll never fi-ind  
Always leavin' and always gone  
Always leavin' and always go-o-one  
Always gone  
  
I could hide the pain inside me but what would I win  
I would lose the right to live and turn the pain to si-i-i-in  
So I'll find another way, some other words to sing  
And whether you're stayin' or leavin' baby, I lose everythi-ing  
  
Here I am, another day, just a wonderin' where I'm at  
Always leavin' and always gone  
You fall on my memory but I try to get you there  
Always leavin' and always gone  
Always leavin' and always go-o-one  
Always gone  
  
Always leavin', always go-one  
Always leavin', always go-one  
Always leavin', always go-one

When you made love to me tonight  
I felt as if I'd died and gone to heaven  
And if that's how it feels to die  
Then lay me in your arms I'm through with livin'  
I'll get down on my knees and thank the good lord up above  
That I'm the lucky girl you chose to love.  
  
And I feel sorry for anyone who isn't me tonight  
So if you think I'm braggin', well you're right  
Your love has sent me flyin and I'm higher than a kite  
And I feel sorry for anyone who isn't me tonight.  
  
You've got the kind of body  
That was made to give a man a lot of pleasure  
And what you're giving me tonight  
Is more than anything on earth can measure  
  
Every inch of you that's woman makes me that much more a man  
I've just about enjoyed all that I can stand.  
  
And I feel sorry for anyone who isn't me tonight  
So if you think I'm braggin', well you're right  
Your love has sent me flyin and I'm higher than a kite  
And I feel sorry for anyone who isn't me tonight.  
  
And I feel sorry for anyone who isn't me tonight  
So if you think I'm braggin', well you're right  
Your love has sent me flyin and I'm higher than a kite  
And I feel sorry for anyone who isn't me tonight...

Ain't funny how time  
Steals the feeling from a love affair  
And there's no place to lay the blame  
'cos in any case, oh, no one cares  
Helplessly we just watched it fade away  
Neither will admit it  
Are we both aching to say.  
  
We, you, I miss the days when we were crazy in love  
When you were so sure of me, I had my little jealousy.  
We, you, bring back the days when we were crazy in love  
I wanna feel that way again, remember when we were crazy in love.  
  
I know it used to be so easy  
One touch and I was high  
And I could get intoxicated  
Just by looking in your eyes  
Oh, baby ain't there anything we can do  
Cos I know you're missing me  
As much as I've been missing you.  
  
We, you,  
  
Girl, we were more than best of friends  
We were crazy in love.

Another day just like all the rest  
Time marches in place at this address  
I can't bring myself to change a single thing  
Every photograph still haunts me from its frame  
I still can't believe I lost your love  
Half empty closets should be proof enough  
Tho' you made it clear, there would be no turning back  
This flame burns in the face of cold hard facts  
  
Crazy Me, there's a light on in the window  
Crazy Me, waits for the phone to ring  
Faithfully, when I should be letting go  
Holding on like late November leaves  
Crazy Me  
  
I guess that I should get on with my life  
Soon as my heart learns the meaning of goodbye  
Take the pieces up and put them in their place  
If reality was something I could face  
Your memory is something I just can't erase  
  
Crazy Me, there's a light on in the window  
Crazy Me, waits for the phone to ring  
Faithfully, when I should be letting go  
Holding on like late November leaves  
Crazy Me

And he'll tell her, he's working late again  
But she knows to well there's something goin' on.  
She's been neglected, and she needs a friend  
So her trembling fingers dial the telephone.  
  
And Lord, it hurts her, doin' this again  
He's the best friend that her husband ever knew.  
When she's lonely, he's more than just a friend  
He's the one she loans her body to.  
  
Daytime friends and nighttime lovers  
Hoping no one else discovers  
Where they go, what they do  
In their secret hideaway  
  
Daytime friends and nighttime lovers  
They don't want to hurt the others  
So they love, in the nighttime  
And shake hands in the light of day.  
  
And when it's over, there's no peace of mind  
Just a longin' for the way things should have been.  
And she wonders, why some men never find  
That a woman needs a lover and a friend.  
  
Daytime friends and nighttime lovers

I think of all the times, I needed you  
And you would come to me, 'cause you wanted too  
And we built the fire that would last through the night  
Still be burnin' in the morning light.  
  
Oh, it must have had a thousand ways  
Of takin' our breath away  
We took a chance or two, didn't we?  
And made some mountains move, oh, didn't we?  
  
From out of the blue storm clouds came  
And it started rainin', we just let it rain  
Oh, it must've been a careless love  
Oh, it had to be a careless love  
Satin sheets, and no regrets  
We had it baby, we had the best, didn't we?.  
  
And every now and then  
I let my feelings show  
And though takes me a while  
Just to let you go  
'Cause you were more than a lover  
And more than a friend  
Never before and never again.  
  
Oh, it must've been  
  
Oh, it ought to be you and me  
Oh, we had a good, didn't we  
Didn't we, didn't we?

[Kenny]  
Just look at you sitting there  
You never looked better than tonight  
And it'd be so easy to tell ya I'd stay  
Like I've done so many times  
  
[Kim Carnes]  
I was so sure this would be the night  
You'd close the door and want to stay with me  
And it'd be so easy to tell ya I'll stay  
Like I've done so many times  
  
[Both]  
Don't fall in love with a dreamer  
'cause he'll always take you in  
Just when you think you've really changed him  
He'll leave you again  
Don't fall in love with a dreamer  
'Cause he'll break you every time  
  
Kim: oh, put out the light  
Kenny: just hold on  
Both: before we say goodbye  
  
[Kim]  
Now it's mornin' and the phone rings  
And you say you've gotta get your things together  
You just gotta leave before ya change your mind  
  
[Kenny]  
And if ya knew what I was thinkin', girl  
I'd turn around if you'd just ask me one more time  
  
Both: don't fall in love with a dreamer  
Kim: 'cause he'll always take you in  
  
[Both]  
Just when you think you've really changed him  
He'll leave you again  
Don't fall in love with a dreamer  
  
Kenny: 'cause he'll break you every time  
Kim: oh, put out the light  
Kenny: just hold on  
Both: before we say goodbye  
Both: before we say goodbye  
Both: goodbye

When the lights go down and the music gets pretty  
Get that cheek-to-cheek look in your eye  
Little boy, go, better grab your honey  
Girl, you'd better grab your guy  
It's time for dream, dream dancing  
Dream, dream dancing.  
  
Out on the dance floor everybody's all alone  
Just squeeze my hand and then let's close our eyes  
And listen to the man play on the saxophone  
As we swerve cross the floor, just there, stars in the sky  
Dream, dream dancing  
Dream, dream dancing.  
  
Close your eyes, hold me tight  
Let the night last forever (repeat).  
And I don't mind if the sun never shines  
And I don't care if tomorrow never comes  
As long as we are ... Dream, dream dancing  
Dream, dream dancing.  
  
When the joint shuts down  
And I'm still feeling up  
We go on home for a little cosy cover  
For our favorite station on the radio  
We'll be dancing close  
We'll be dancing slow.  
  
Dream, dream dancing ...

Elvira, Elvira  
My heart's on fire for Elvira  
  
We look like dough, lips like sherry wine  
She can sure enough make my little light shine  
I get a funny feelin' up and down my spine  
'Cause I know that my Elvira's mine  
  
Giddy up oom poppa omm poppa mow mow  
Giddy up oom poppa omm poppa mow mow  
Heigh-ho silver, away  
  
Elvira, Elvira  
My heart's on fire for Elvira  
  
Tonight I'm gonna meet her to hungry house cafe  
And I'm gonna give her all the love I can  
She's gonna jump and holler  
'Cause I saved up two dollars  
She's gonna search and find that preacher man  
  
Elvira, Elvira  
My heart's on fire for Elvira  
  
Elvira, Elvira  
Elvira, na, na, na, na, na, na, na  
Elvira, na, na, na, na, na, na, na  
Elvira, na, na, na, na, na, na, na

If you never rode West of the Arizona border  
You can turn the other way boy but you never get far  
You be living a lie if you wanna see the wonders of the age  
You must follow the evening star  
  
Evening star  
Shine a little Heaven  
On a stranger with no dream  
Where you are  
  
You can see the loneliness I mean and if I gotta fight  
I can never play somebody else's game, I can follow the evening star  
Starlight, you never need somebody else's name  
If you follow the evening star  
  
Have you ever known a sunset when the sky's on fire  
How you end another day boy you've been searching too far  
Like the desert I rode on any memory is lost in the restless wind  
I just lie beneath the evening star  
  
Evening star  
Shine a little Heaven  
On a stranger with no dream  
Where you are  
  
Have you ever held a woman in the California moonlight  
Put your money on a good night if you never been there  
It's a sight for sore eyes if you wanna see the wonders of the age  
Making love beneath the evening star  
  
Evening star  
Shine a little Heaven  
On a stranger with no dream  
Where you are  
  
You can see the loneliness I mean and if I gotta fight  
I will never play somebody else's game, I can follow the evening star  
Starlight, you never need somebody else's name  
If you follow the evening star

Love, soft as an easy chair  
Love, fresh as the morning air  
One love that is shared by two  
I have found with you  
  
Like a rose under the April snow  
I was always certain love would grow  
Love, ageless and evergreen  
Seldom seen by two  
  
You and I will  
make each night the first  
Everyday a beginning  
Spirits rise and their dance is unrehearsed  
  
They warm and excite us  
'Cause we have the brightest love  
Two lights that shine as one Morning glory and midnight sun  
Time, we've learned to sail above  
  
Time, won't change the meaning of one love  
Ageless and ever evergreen

You're not meant to be alone I'll share your dream  
I'll show you love you've never know-ow-own  
Two flames together in the deep of the night  
Up in your love  
  
Close by you, when you call, I'll take my stand  
One chance to make or lose it a-a-all  
This time my journey to wherever you are-are-are  
I sail on your river, so far my love we'll never be found  
  
If you believe we got eyes, that see in the dark  
And the power of love lives for making you mine  
And in the light of close investigation  
Is it only my imagination, I got you, I got you  
  
Moonlight shining on your face. my bridges burned  
With all my tears that you replaced  
Two hearts together is a beautiful sight  
I'll take you to heaven, so far my love will follow you there-ere  
  
If we believe we got eye-eyes that see in the dark  
And the power of love lives for making you mine  
Am I the light of someone you need more of  
Let me be that love you can be sure of  
Is it only my imagination, I got you  
  
Like the eagle that flies in the sun  
I'll be lost in your fire before we are do-o-one  
And the view from my window is brighter  
Born to be all you need  
  
We got eye-eyes that see in the dark  
And the power of love lives for makin' you mine  
Am I the light of someone you need more of  
Let me be that love you can be sure of  
Is it only my imagination, I got you  
  
We got eyes that see in the dark  
And the power of love lives (fade)

Fighting fire with fire.  
  
You came here on purpose, in front of me, Diana  
To be seen with some other man  
You're wanting me to watch him, enjoy the freedom  
You're letting him take with his hands.  
  
Did you tell or must I tell him, Diana  
Does it matter to that kind of man?  
Any place he touches or kisses, Diana  
Is some place I've already been.  
  
You know you're fighting fire with fire  
Over something that broke us apart  
At least I was hiding and trying, Diana  
To keep it from breaking your heart.  
  
You must've been crazy, for taking advantage  
Of the fact that you weren't around  
But she was so soft and pretty  
And she made a promise, never to utter a sound.  
  
Can you tell or must I tell you, Diana  
It's a heart burning hell that I'm in  
And any place he touches or kisses, Diana  
I'd gladly crawl back there again.  
  
You know...

For you alone, I'd conquer world  
I'd do most anything for you alone  
For you alone, I'd give everything  
I'd say the sweetest thing for you alone.  
  
The things I can do I've been thinking of  
That I should have done alone  
Yet all these things I've been thinking of  
Are no good to do alone.  
  
For you alone, Ooh I'd write a song  
Using these words alone for you alone.  
The things ....

He's living in that big old house that he knows was built by me  
He's playing with the baby that belongs to her and me  
At night he loves a woman that was held by these two hands  
He must be leaving hell to live with a ghost of another man  
  
My name is in the side wall outside our bedroom door  
He can't help but see what's too dare in me everywhere he goes  
He gladly walked through heaven to forget what he can't stand  
He must be leaving hell to live with a ghost of another man  
  
I don't mean to haunt him when they turn out the lights  
I'm there in the bedroom with both of them each night  
And he wonders if he just loved her as good as I loved her back then  
He must be leaving hell to live with a ghost of another man

Now just look, the whole tow-own  
Has turned out today  
To say a last prayer for me  
And Lord only knows  
How surprised they would be  
If they knew I could see them  
And I could hear what they say  
Whoa, if they knew I could see them  
And I could hear what they say  
  
Some say I was a good ma-an  
Some disagree-ee-ee  
Some folks are sad  
So-ome are glad  
To see the last of me-ee-ee  
I know I was happy ma-an  
Most of my day-ay-ays  
And through it all  
If I had a time or two  
It was worth it to me  
  
I'm the last of my fam'ly  
So I'm takin' my name  
No children do I leave behi-i-ind  
To sing Rock Of Ages  
For an old warn out cowboy  
You can take away my body  
But the spirit is mine  
Woh, you can take away my body, yeah  
But the spirit is mine  
  
Some say I was a good ma-an  
And some disagree-ee-ee  
Some folks are sad  
And some are glad  
To see the last of me-ee-ee  
I know I was happy ma-an  
Most of my day-ay-ays  
And through it all  
If I had a time or two  
It was worth it to me  
  
Some say I was a good ma-an  
Some dis-a-gree...

Going back to Alabama.  
  
Going back to Alabama  
Now that I've learned the thing too  
Life with me ain't been so easy  
But I've got some living yet to do.  
  
'Cos a man who walks by the side of the road  
Can turn himself around  
He can pick himself fast, just himself fast  
And start all over again, my friend.  
  
Some days I didn't wanna wake up in the morning  
My family and friends were all down on me  
I tried to tell 'em where I was going  
But they never saw the man I saw in me.  
  
Some folks called me a dreamer  
Other folks left and called me a fool  
All I ever wanted to be was a winner  
'cos I know a winner can never lose.  
  
'Cos a man who walks ...

I woke up this morning all cotton mouthed from drinking  
Wonderin' how I'd made it through the day  
  
Wild eyed and crazy all burnt out from thinkin'  
Wonderin' how the hell I's gonna say  
  
Goodbye marie - oh goodbye Marie  
Out the window there's a lonesome highway callin' me  
It was fun Marie - I gotta run Marie  
If I cannot keep your love  
At least I'll have your memory  
  
Wakin' up beside you in the Tijuana mornin'  
With that ocean breeze to keep us cool  
  
Three weeks of lovin' - 21 nights of heaven  
I stayed just long enough to be your fool  
  
Goodbye Marie - oh goodbye Marie  
Out the window there's a lonesome highway callin' me  
It was fun Marie - I gotta run Marie  
If I cannot keep your love  
At least I'll have your memory  
  
Por favor pour me One more tequila  
I need all the courage I can find  
  
This time tomorrow I'll be back in Houston  
Thinkin' about the girl I left behind  

The old hometown looks the same as I step down from the train  
And there to meet me is my mama and papa  
And down the road I look and there runs Mary  
Hair of gold and lips like cherries  
It's good to touch the green green grass of home  
Yes, they've all come to meet me  
Arms reaching, smiling sweetly  
It's so good to touch the green green grass of home  
The old house is still standing though the paint is cracked and dry  
And there's that old oak tree that I used to play on  
Down the lane I'd walk with my sweet Mary  
Hair of gold and lips like cherries  
It's good to touch the green green grass of home  
Yes, they've all come to meet me  
Arms reaching, smiling sweetly  
It's so good to touch the green green grass of home  
Then I awake and look around me at the gray walls that surround me  
And I realized that I was only dreaming  
For there's a guard and there's a sad old padre  
Arm in arm we'll walk at daybreak  
Again I'll touch the green green grass of home  
Yes, they'll all come to see me  
In the shade of that old oak tree  
As they lay me 'neath the green green grass of home  

I can chop wood from dusk till dawn  
I can swing a hammer till the daylight's gone  
I can build a barn, I can make a home with these two hands  
But if I didn't have all your love, I'd be half a man  
  
I can fly a plane up in the big blue sky  
Blaze a trail through the woods in my four-wheel drive  
With a team of horses or an old John Deere, I can plow this land  
But if I didn't have all your love, I'd be half a man  
  
I can hang the stars, I can rope the moon  
Walk across Texas in these cowboy boots  
I can run a train till it runs out of track  
With the weight of the world laid across my back  
My life still wouldn't be worth a damn  
If I didn't have all your love, I'd be half a man  
  
I can build a fire with nothin' but a stick  
If I put my mind to it, there ain't much I can't fix  
I can read an' count, I can figure things out if you give me a chance  
But if I didn't have all your love, I'd be half a man  
  
I can hang the stars, I can rope the moon  
Walk across Texas in these cowboy boots  
I can run a train till it runs out of track  
With the weight of the world laid across my back  
An' my life still wouldn't be worth a damn  
If I didn't have all your love, I'd be half a man  
  
Whoa, I can hang the stars, I can rope the moon  
Walk across Texas in these cowboy boots  
I can run a train till it runs out of track  
With the weight of the world laid across my back  
But my life still wouldn't be worth a damn  
If I didn't have all your love, I'd be half a man  
If I didn't have all your love, I'd be half a man  
Ah ha, whoa, yeah, hmm, hmm, hmm

The wait turned into hours  
Before you came my way  
The smile that filled a daddy's heart  
On the special day  
The moment left me speechless  
I didn't know what to say  
Then you took your first breath  
That took mine away  
  
Days go by so quickly  
Summer turns to fall  
Seems like only yesterday  
That you began to crawl  
So don't be afraid to take that step  
I'll catch you when you fall  
I don't mind if you leave behind  
A few hand prints on the wall  
  
I can't describe this feeling  
Way down deep inside  
The itsy-bitsy spider  
Was the first thing that we tried  
Patty cake, the baker's man  
With your hands so very small  
You could always stay this young  
And I wouldn't mind at all  
  
Days go by so quickly  
Summer turns to fall  
Seems like only yesterday  
That you began to crawl  
So don't be afraid to take that step  
I'll catch you when you fall  
I don't mind if you leave behind  
A few hand prints on the wall

Hey, maybe I'll dye my hair  
Maybe I'll move somewhere  
Maybe I'll get a car  
Maybe I'll drive so far  
They'll all lose track  
Me, I'll bounce right back  
  
Maybe I'll sleep real late  
Maybe I'll lose some weight  
Maybe I'll clear my junk  
Maybe I'll just get drunk on apple wine  
Me, I'll be just  
  
Fine and dandy  
Lord, it's like a hard candy Christmas  
I'm barely getting through tomorrow  
But still I won't let sorrow bring me way down  
  
I'll be fine and dandy  
Lord, it's like a hard candy Christmas  
I'm barely getting through tomorrow  
But still I won't let sorrow get me way down  
  
Hey, maybe I'll learn to sew  
Maybe I'll just lie low  
Maybe I'll hit the bars  
Maybe I'll count the stars until dawn  
Me, I will go on  
  
Maybe I'll settle down  
Maybe I'll just leave town  
Maybe I'll have some fun  
Maybe I'll meet someone  
And make him mine  
Me, I'll be just  
  
Fine and dandy  
Lord, it's like a hard candy Christmas  
I'm barely getting throng tomorrow  
But still I won't let sorrow bring me way down  
  
I'll be fine and dandy  
Lord, it's like a hard candy Christmas  
I'm barely getting through tomorrow  
But still I won't let sorrow bring me way down  
  
I'll be fine and dandy  
Lord it's like a hard candy Christmas  
I'm barely getting through tomorrow  
But still I won't let sorrow bring me way down  
  
'Cause I'll be fine  
(I'll be fine)  
Oh, I'll be fine

Have I told you lately that I love you  
Have I told you there's no one else above you  
Fill my heart with gladness  
Take away all my sadness  
Ease my troubles that's what you do.  
  
For the morning sun and all its glory  
Greets the day with hope and comfort too  
You fill my life with laughter  
Take it away and make it better  
Ease my troubles that's what you do.  
There's a love lost you found  
And it's yours and it's mine  
Like the sun, and at the end of the day  
We should give thanks and pray  
To the one, oh, to the one.

Have yourself a merry little Christmas  
Let your heart be light  
From now on our troubles will be out of sight  
  
Have yourself a merry little Christmas  
Make the Yuletide gay  
From now on, our troubles will be miles away  
  
Here we are as in olden days  
Happy golden days of yore  
Faithful friends who are dear to us  
Gather near to us once more  
  
Through the years we all will be together  
If the fates allow  
Hang a shinning star upon the highest bough  
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now  
  
Here we are as in olden days  
Happy golden days of yore  
Faithful friends who are dear to us  
Gather near to us once more  
  
Through the years we all will be together  
If the fates allow  
Hang a shinning star upon the highest bough  
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now

Two room house on an acre lot, it ain't much but it's all they've got  
Boy, sometimes it sure seems a lot to keep up on her own  
A pile of bills and a load of clothes, wipin' tears from a two year old  
And makin' sure supper's on before he makes it home  
In her mind she hears him say, ?I'm gonna make it better someday?  
  
He will, she knows  
He's gonna build their dreams a little further down the road  
Her faith, it shows even if the whole world says he won't  
He will, she knows  
  
He spends all day under a hood makin' Chevrolet's run like they should  
He don't like it much, but the pay is good and that's enough to make him stay  
He's workin lot's of overtime ?cause he's got a little plan in mind  
For a hill off highway 109 that he drives by everyday  
Sometimes money's hard to save but if anyone can find a way  
  
He will, she knows  
He's gonna build their dreams a little further down the road  
Her faith, it shows even if the whole world says he won't  
He will, she knows  
  
Every night he holds her close and she believes  
If anyone can make it more than just a dream  
  
He will, she knows  
He's gonna build their dreams a little further down the road  
Her faith, it shows even if the whole world says he won't  
He will, she knows  

It's so lonely out tonight  
And the feeling just got right  
For a brand new love song  
Somebody done somebody wrong song  
  
Hey, won't you play another  
Somebody done somebody wrong song  
And make me feel at home  
While I miss my baby, while I miss my baby  
  
So play, play for me a sad melody  
So sad that it makes everybody cry  
A real hurtin' song about a love that's gone wrong  
'Cause I don't wanna cry all alone  
  
So hey, won't you play another  
Somebody done somebody wrong song  
And make me feel at home  
While I miss my baby, while I miss my baby  
  
So, play, play for me a sad melody  
So, sad that it makes everybody cry  
A real hurtin' song about a love that's gone wrong  
'Cause I don't wanna cry all alone  
  
Hey, won't you play another  
Somebody done somebody wrong song  
And make me feel at home  
While I miss my baby, while I miss my baby  
  
Somebody done somebody wrong song  
And make me feel at home  
While I miss my baby, while I miss my baby  
I miss my baby

If my heart's not too late  
For a piece of your TIME  
There's been so many days  
Since your eyes looked at mine.  
In the dark of this room  
Where the burning has grown  
You believe in your love  
When you're lost and alone  
And life don't give no reasons  
When the love goes away  
No answers for someone like you.  
  
Chorus  
Hold me, hold me  
Seems like we never get together anymore  
Hold me, hold me  
Starry nights don't come enough  
That's what we come here for, hold me.  
  
I will lay by your side  
I can warm your cold nights  
You can play in my dreams  
Til I'm out of your sight  
In the morning my love  
Couldn't change where you go  
You were always my woman  
It's the one truth I know  
So hold out, when there's no chance  
For your love anyway  
No diamond could shine close to you  
  
Chorus:  
Hold me, hold me  
Seems like we never get together anymore  
Hold me, hold me  
Starry nights don't come enough  
That's what we CAME here for, hold me.

Homemade love just like mama used to make  
Homemade love that's what she used to say  
You can satisfy frustration and the same old one night stand  
But there ain't nothing quite as good as homemade love  
Homemade love all the cold and lonely nights  
Feel so good when your woman makes it right  
And she knows just how to please in each and every way  
There ain't nothing quite as good as homemade love  
Homemade love love home ain't nothing without love her sweet love  
And you know it won't be over she'll be there every day  
Homemade love take it with you when you go  
Homemade love let everybody know  
That your woman ain't to please as she's headed straight for you  
There ain't nothing quite as good as homemade love  
Homemade love love home ain't nothing...  
  

There's your picture by the bed  
I'm gonna leave it where it is  
'cause if I tear it out tonight  
My heart would know  
But something ain't right  
Between me and you.  
I'm gonna lie here in the dark  
And pretend you're in my arms  
And if I can't keep on crying out your name  
My heart would think you're here beside me  
And things are still the same.  
My mind knows it's over  
But how do I break it to my heart  
If I let it down easy  
It'd still be torn apart  
And if I tell it the truth  
Then the pain is gonna start  
My mind knows it's over  
But how do I break it to my heart.  
When I saw him by your side  
I guess it opened up my eyes  
And my ears can finally hear your soft goodbye  
But my heart still says I'm loving you tonight  
And for the rest of its life.

How long 'till I touch you  
'till I hold you, 'till I see you again  
'cos I've been searchin' forever  
And forever, on me you can depend.  
  
I've been waitin' for a girl like you  
One that I can call my own  
Tell me if this dream of mine will come true  
Girl, I'd really like to know, I'd like to know.  
  
How long  
Before you let me know you  
Before you let me show you  
All I have in my heart.  
  
'cos you are my inspiration  
Can't you see that I need you  
Honey, I wanna start.  
  
Let me show you, girl  
How good love can be  
With someone who love you so  
Tell me what it takes to win your sweet love  
Girl, I'd really like to know  
  
'cos I've been waitin' for a girl like you  
One that I can call my own  
Tell me if this dream of mine will come true  
Girl, I'd really like to know, I'd like to know.  
  
I'd like to know.

Would you like to dance?  
Not very good, I'll admit it  
I just need a minute or two  
Close your eyes, cos  
  
I can't believe your eyes  
Wild and blue, warm and willing  
I can't believe your eyes  
Is it true what they're saying?  
  
Women come and go  
So many occasions I have to look twice  
To catch your second show  
One look at you, that's all I needed tonight, 'cos  
  
I can't believe your '  
  
Don't stop, the music playing  
Don't wanna lose it tonight  
Now that we got that feeling  
So good, so right  
  
I can't believe your '

Postcards and letters and pictures  
Made to last forever  
To be boxed up and tossed away  
Knick knacks and souvenirs  
In an afternoon they're out of here  
Have disappeared without a trace  
But what they mean to me can never be erased  
  
I can't unthink about you  
I can't unfeel your touch  
I can't unhear all the words  
Unsay all the things  
That used to mean so much  
Wish I could unremember  
Everything my heart's been through  
And finding out it's impossible to do  
Oh it's no use  
I can't unlove you  
  
Interstates and old songs  
Like time they go on and on  
I guess could learn to do the same  
I can wake up without you  
These two arms not around you  
Tell myself it was meant to be this way  
No matter how I try  
Some things I can't change  
  
I can't unthink about you  
I can't unfeel your touch  
I can't unhear all the words  
Unsay all the things  
That used to mean so much  
Wish I could unremember  
Everything my heart's been through  
And finding out it's impossible to do  
Oh it's no use  
I can't unlove you  
  
I wish I could unremember  
Everything my heart's been though  
And finding out it's impossible to do  
Oh it's no use  
I can't unlove you

I do it for your love  
I'm not sentimental, no one calls me tender  
I keep my emotions safe inside  
But I've never felt these feelings  
And time just keeps revealing  
A part of me I can no longer hide  
The moment that I kissed your lips  
I found a whole new world exists  
Look what you've done with my life.  
If I write your name a thousand times  
Inside a heart next to mine  
Act like a fool whose faith is blind  
Whatever I do, I do it for your love.  
I'm not one for flowers  
Or talking on the phone for hours  
Fancy words have never been my game  
An answered prayer I never prayed  
That came true anyway  
Now I know I'll never be the same.  
If I light a candle in the night  
To see the reflection in your eyes  
You don't even need to ask me why  
Whatever I do, I do it for your love.  
I write your name

It was six in the morning  
When I made the county line  
There's someone I got to talk to  
I can't get it off my mind  
  
He's just a kid  
And he's in a pretty rough spot  
Two dimes to make a phone call  
That's about all I've got  
  
How's my boy today?  
I know it's been three weeks  
But you know how far I've got to go  
To make those loose ends meet  
  
How's your mama now  
With her new live-in friend  
Oh how I hate the wounds  
That never seem to mend  
  
[Chorus:]  
And he says I don't call him daddy  
but he takes care of things  
When you pick me up on Friday  
Are you gonna bring me anything?  
Oh don't worry dad ya know  
It don't matter what we do  
I don't call him daddy  
He could never be like you  
Never be like you  
  
God bless their little hearts  
They're the ones who really pay  
When mom and dad can't get along  
And go their seperate ways  
In a way I'm glad there's someone  
There to fill the empty place  
Tears of understanding  
Streak down a dirty face  
  
[Chorus]  
  
He is quite a little man  
Growing up as fast as he can  
And I don't get to see him  
Half as much as I had planned  
There's so much I need to tell him  
So precious little time  
A little rain on the window  
In a little way goodbye  
  
[Chorus x2]

I don't need you.  
I don't need friendship.  
I don't need flowers in the Spring.  
I don't need you.  
And you surely don't want me.  
  
I don't need love and affection.  
I don't peace and harmony.  
I don't need you.  
And you surely don't need me.  
  
[Chorus]  
But we both want it bad enough.  
Yes, we both want it. Don't we?  
I don't need you baby.  
And I know you don't need me.  
  
I don't need your loving arms around me.  
All I need is to be free.  
That's what I keep telling myself.  
And I tell you, you don't need me.  
  
I don't need children in my old age.  
No more cluttered leaves around the tree.  
And I don't need you baby.  
And I know you don't need me.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And we don't need each other, baby.  
We don't need each other, baby.  
Or do we?

I don't wanna know why  
  
I took your love as desperate measure  
Seeking shelter from another lonely night  
You took my love seeking only pleasure  
But the feeling passes and the passion doesn't last.  
  
And I don't wanna know why, I don't want no reasons  
I just feel the seasons, as they touch another year.  
And I don't wanna know why, I don't want no reasons  
I just know what is now, and what could never be.  
  
Will the memories fade or will they linger?  
Will we live forever for a moment we can keep?  
Now we stand alone  
(why don't you do what you told me)  
Where we stood together  
(I only wanted you to hold me)  
How did we ever let this dream slip through our hand  
(how did we ever let this dream slip through our hand).  
  
And I don't wanna know ....

When tempting eyes across the road  
Said to me I'd love to be with you  
I'm not tempted for a moment  
I just think about my woman  
The baby calls me on the phone  
Telling me I need to hurrily home  
Well the hurrying is easy  
Because she's waiting up  
With all the love I need  
  
I prefer the moonlight  
The one right little lady by my side  
That's what I like  
I prefer a late drive down the turn park  
With the moonlight shining so brightly  
Got her by my side  
That's what I'd like  
I prefer the moonlight  
  
I prefer playing quiet song  
She's a mother love her daughter  
Moonlight dances on the water  
The moon is full and so am I  
I look at her and feel like I could cry  
But my tears contain no sorrow  
Because I know  
She'll wake up by my side tomorrow  
  
Morning, noon and night  
When the feeling comes so right  
Somewhere in some sky  
Where the moon is surely shining bright  

I remember you  
You're the one who made my dreams come true  
A few kisses go.  
  
I remember you  
You're the one who said 'I love you too, I do'  
Didn't you know'.  
  
I remember too  
A distant bell and stars that fell like rain  
Out of the blue.  
  
When my life is through  
And the angels ask me to recall  
The thrill of them all  
Then I should tell them: I remember you.  
  
When my life '

God said  
Mary  
Pure and  
Holy  
With this  
Baby  
I trust you  
  
She said  
Surly  
I'm not  
Worthy  
And it  
Scares me  
But I trust you  
  
[Chorus]  
Underneath a shining star  
In a manger stall  
Mary held the gift of love  
God gave to us all  
  
Precious  
Baby  
Pure and  
Holy  
I'm not worthy  
But I trust you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Precious  
Baby  
Pure and  
Holy  
Will you  
Save me  
I trust you  
  
Son of  
Mary  
I trust you

I want a son.  
  
I want a son  
Someone I can blame for turning grey  
To share my name, to share my days  
To share the things I've earned  
The lessons that I've learned along the way  
He'd have a friend and we'd have fun  
I love to laugh and I would love to have a son.  
  
I want a girl  
Twirling round the room in pink and blue  
To count on me, to see her through  
Who'd worry when I'm late  
And tell me that I'm great when it's not true  
She'd have a friend and we'd have fun  
I'd love a daughter just as I would love a son.  
  
I wanna care  
I wanna wonder where they are  
I wanna see that they go farther than me  
And carry on, the things I love, when I'm gone.  
  
Forgetting me  
I'd be good for them, I really would  
They'd have someone who understood  
Who'd always be around  
And never let them down, I never could.  
  
He'd have a friend and we'd have fun  
She'd have a friend, we'd all be one  
I'd love to have a girl  
Or I would love to have a son.

I want to make you smile  
When I run too fast, slow me down  
When I run to far, turn me around  
Sometimes life becomes an endless waste  
Sometimes love can't stand the lonely pace.  
Each day goes by much too fast  
Tomorrow soon becomes the past  
Lost in struggle I'm making my way  
Not taking time enough to simply say:  
I love you, forgive me  
I know it's been a while  
I love you, I wanna stop the world  
And make you smile.  
Too many days I forgot to take your time  
To say I love you and thank you for being mine  
Those simple words I sometimes forget to say  
We'll be on my lips at the wake of each new day.  
I love you ...  
But you know I love you  
I wanna stop the world and make you smile  
If it's not too late to make you smile.  
  

If I should stay  
I would only be in your way  
So, I'll go but I know  
I'll think of you  
  
Each step of the way  
And I will always love you  
And I will always love you  
Bittersweet memories,  
  
That is all I am taking with me  
So goodbye, please don't you cry  
'Cause we both know I'm not what you need  
And I will always love you  
And I will always love you  
  
I hope life treats you kind  
And I hope you have all you've dreamed of  
And I wish you joy and happiness  
But above all, I wish you love  
  
And I will always love you  
And I will always love you  
And I will always love you

I will remember you  
Will you remember me?  
Don't let your life pass you by  
Weep not for the memories  
  
I'm so tired  
I can't sleep  
Standing on the edge of something  
Much too deep  
  
It's funny how we feel so much  
And cannot say a word  
We're screaming inside  
But we can't be heard  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So afraid to love you  
More afraid to lose  
Clinging to a past  
That doesn't let me choose  
  
Well once there was a darkness  
A deep and endless night  
You gave me everything  
You gave me life  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Remember all the good times that we had  
Let them slip away from us  
When things got bad  
  
How clearly I first saw you  
Smiling in the sun  
I want to feel your warmth around me  
I want to be the one  
  
[Chorus ]  
  
[Chorus ]  
  
Weep not for the memories  
  
Weep not for the memories

Hello, it was good to get your call  
You haven't changed at all  
You're the same as far as I can tell  
No way, I see something in your face  
Someone's filled the empty space in your life  
Well, I'm glad to hear you're doing well.  
  
I wish I could say that but I'd be lying  
I'm still not over the fact  
That you stopped trying  
It was easy for you to just let go  
Of all we had  
I wish I could say that.  
  
What' Do you mean there's no one new  
It's my memory haunting you  
Now you want the things we had back then  
Inside there's a part of you  
That's still loving me and always will  
'til the end  
And you'd like to see us try again.  
  
I wish I could say that ...

Oh, I wish that I could hurt that way again  
At least I had you every now and then  
And in between the sorrow  
At least there was tomorrow  
And as long as there's tomorrow  
There's no end  
Oh, I wish that I could hurt that way again.  
  
Oh, I wish that we could play that game again  
Even though I'd always lose and you would win  
At times you would desert me  
The emptiness would hurt me  
But your coming back  
Was always worth the pain  
Oh, I wish that I could hurt that way again.  
  
I?d love to hear you tell me  
You don't need me anymore  
Just like you used to tell me everyday  
I'd love to watch you leaving  
Like the hundred times before  
At least my eyes could see you walk away.  
  
Oh, I wish

It might've been a Saturday night  
It ain't clear it was so long ago  
It was somewhere across the county line  
A dance or a party I don't know  
But I do know you looked like an angel  
And your eyes were the color of your dress.  
  
There's a million things I don't remember  
But that's the one thing that I won't forget.  
  
It might've been a Saturday night  
It was either my folks car or yours  
I know that we went to some drive-in  
What was playing that night I'm not sure  
But I am sure you whispered you loved me  
As my lips softly pressed against your neck.  
  
There's a million ...  
  
After a while I guess we agreed  
We had wings we needed to test  
Somehow we talked ourselves out of love  
That such close to love as I've gotten yet.  
  
It was 2:21 on a Sunday  
And I found myself standing in the rain  
You blew me a kiss through the window  
As your greyhound was pulling away  
Inside I was dying to stop you  
I should've listened to my heart  
And not my head.

JUST ONCE IN MY LIFE  
IF I COULD FIND SOMEONE, IF ONCE  
THE FEELING WAS RIGHT  
I'D NEVER LET HER GO  
I'D ALWAYS BE THERE  
IF I COULD HAVE MY CHANCE TO BE  
THE ONLY ONE  
IT JUST ISN'T FAIR  
  
CHORUS  
  
IF I COULD HOLD ON TO LOVE  
I'D NEVER LET IT GO  
I'D KEEP IT RIGHT NEXT TO MY HEART  
  
IF I COULD HOLD HER TONIGHT  
SHE'D NEVER LEAVE MY SIDE  
IF I COULD ONLY HOLD ON TO LOVE  
  
I'M SEARCHING MY DREAMS  
I'M TRYING TO RECOGNIZE THAT FACE,  
OH,  
WHO CAN IT BE?  
SHE'S CALLING OUT TO ME AND NOW  
I'M  
  
RUNNING TO HER  
BUT EVERYTIME I GET THIS CLOSE  
SHE VANISHES  
INTO THE NIGHT  
  
REPEAT CHORUS  
  
IS IT EVER COME TO PASS  
THAT I FIND A LOVE THAT LASTS  
OR IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK?  
  
IF I COULD HOLD HER TONIGHT  
SHE'D NEVER LEAVE MY SIDE  
IF I COULD ONLY HOLD ON TO LOVE  
IF I COULD ONLY HOLD ON TO LOVE

I've foudn a great deal of satisfaction  
Thinking that you think of me  
I've found each day  
Bring a new sunshine  
There is no tomorrow  
For us to borrow  
Why can't you find  
What you are needing in me  
If I could only change your mind  
  
I found no effort at all  
In showing what I'm feeling you  
I find it hard each day just knowing  
There's no tomorrow for us to borrow  
Why won't you find  
What you are needing in me  
If I could only change your mind

If I knew then what I know now  
  
Well, hello girl, tell me, how have you been?  
By the way, I'll never make the same mistake again  
And you know girl, it's been a long hard time  
Nothing like back when you were mine.  
  
And if I knew then what I know now  
I'd have found the way  
To make things work out somehow  
I'd have held you tight  
I'd have treated you right  
If I knew then what I know now.  
  
It's a crazy world for a boy and a girl  
Harder than it is for a woman and a man  
Oh, it was easy then just to push you away  
Guess I never knew how I feel today.  
  
If we knew then...  
  
You know I do things differently  
If you ever come back to me  
If we could just go back in time  
There's no broken heart  
Girl, we're at the start this time.

If I were a painting  
Captured on canvas  
Alone in the portriat I would stand  
And brush strokes bold  
Yet soft as a whisper  
The work of a feminine hand  
  
Caught in a still life  
Surrounded by shadows  
And lost in a background of blue  
  
If I were a painting  
My price would be pain  
And the artist would have to be you  
  
I imagine the colors  
Would all run together  
If you ever allowed me to cry  
So don't paint the tears  
Just let me remember me  
Without you in my LIFE  
  
It's only the frame  
That holds me together  
Or else I would be falling apart  
  
If I were a painting  
I wouldn't feel  
And you wouldn't be breaking my heart

You've got it made, you've got real love  
Something you don't find every day  
Someone to trust, someone to lean on  
Something I would hold onto if I were you  
  
You've got it made, you've got no one  
You don't have those strings to tie you down  
You come and go free as the wind blows  
I wouldn't settle down too soon if I were you  
  
If I were you, I'd be satisfied  
Oh, I'm sure the grass is greener on the other side  
If I were you, I'd stay by her side (I'd be running wild)  
I would never leave her  
That's what I would do  
If I were you  
  
If I were you, I'd be satisfied  
Oh, I'm sure the grass is greener on the other side  
If I were you, would I rather be (would I rather be)  
Someone just like me?  
I wouldn't change a single thing  
If I were you

I'll be there for you  
You don't have to feel alone  
Like a shadow by your side  
I'll be with you right or wrong  
  
You stumble and you fall  
But you can always lean on me  
I'll be there to see you through  
I'll be there for you  
  
I'll be there for you  
When your dreams seem far away  
Even in the darkest night  
You can face the world unafraid  
  
And if you close your eyes  
You will feel me next to you  
No matter what you're going through  
I'll be there for you  
  
Here today, here tomorrow  
Through the joy, laughter and sorrow  
You're in my heart, we're kindred souls  
If you could read my mind  
You'd know...  
  
I'll be there for you  
The one who comes to your rescue  
I'm the one you'll never leave  
I'll be there for you  
No matter what...

Baby when I met you there was peace unknown  
I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb  
I was soft inside there was something going on  
  
You do something to me that I can't explain  
Hold me closer and I feel no pain every beat of my heart  
We got something going on  
  
Tender love is blind it requires a dedication  
All this love we feel needs no conversation  
We ride it together, uh huh  
Makin' love with each other, uh huh  
  
Islands in the stream that is what we are  
No one in between how can we be wrong?  
Sail away with me to another world  
And we rely on each other, uh huh  
From one lover to another, uh huh  
  
I can't live without you if the love is gone  
Everything is nothing if you got no one  
And you did walk in the night  
Slowly losin' sight of the real thing  
  
But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt  
Too deep in love and we got no way out  
And the message is clear this could be the year for the real thing  
  
No more will you cry, baby I will hurt you never  
We start and end as one in love forever  
We can ride it together, uh huh  
Makin' love with each other, uh huh  
  
Islands in the stream that is what we are  
No one in between how can we be wrong?  
Sail away with me to another world  
And we rely on each other, uh huh  
From one lover to another, uh huh  
  
Islands in the stream that is what we are  
No one in between how can we be wrong?  
Sail away with me to another world  
And we rely on each other, uh huh  
From one lover to another, uh huh  
  
Islands in the stream that is what we are  
No one in between how can we be wrong?  
Sail away with me to another world  
And we rely on each other, uh huh  
From one lover to another, uh huh  
  
Islands in the stream that is what we are

Lady, I'm your knight in shining armor and I love you  
You have made me what I am and I am yours  
My love, there's so many ways I want to say I love you  
Let me hold you in my arms forever more  
  
You have gone and made me such a fool  
I'm so lost in your love  
And oh, we belong together  
Won't you believe in my song?  
  
Lady, for so many years I thought I'd never find you  
You have come into my life and made me whole  
Forever let me wake to see you each and every morning  
Let me hear you whisper softly in my ear  
  
In my eyes I see no one else but you  
There's no other love like our love  
And yes, oh yes, I'll always want you near me  
I've waited for you for so long  
  
Lady, your love's the only love I need  
And beside me is where I want you to be  
Cause, my love, there's somethin' I want you to know  
You're the love of my life, you're my lady

In a way I'm glad it's over  
Even though it's gonna hurt me once you're gone  
But I can learn to live without you  
Give me time and I can make it on my own  
  
'Cause lovin' you to me came easy  
Now, losing you will change my life no doubt  
In a way I'm glad it's over  
In another way it turns me inside out  
  
In a way I guess it's better  
Even though there's nothing good about goodbye  
But I know I couldn't hold you  
Now, you've found your wings and you need room to fly  
  
It's for sure I'm gonna miss you  
But I guess that's what goodbye is all about  
In a way I'm glad it's over  
In another way it turns me inside out  
  
On the one hand I know, I'll be better off once you're gone  
But I find a lot of heartache on the other  
And I can't say I'm looking forward to those nights I'll spend alone  
And I wonder will there ever be another  
  
'Cause loving you to me came easy  
Now, losing you will change my life no doubt  
In a way I'm glad it's over  
In another way it turns me inside out  
  
In a way I'm glad it's over  
In another way it turns me inside out

Beautiful Life  
You can do what you want just seize the day  
What you're doing tomorrow's gonna come your way  
Don't you ever consider giving up, you will find, oooh  
It's a beautiful life, oooh  
It's a beautiful life, oooh  
It's a beautiful life, oooh  
I just want to be here beside you  
And stay until the break of dawn  
Take a walk in the park when you feel down  
There's so many things there that's gonna lift you up  
See the nature in bloom a laughing child  
Such a dream, oooh  
It's a beautiful life, oooh...  
I just want to be here beside you  
I just want to be here beside you  
and stay until the break of dawn  
You're looking for somewhere to belong  
You're standing all alone  
for someone to guide you on your way  
Now and forever  
It's a beautiful life, oooh...  
I just want to be anybody  
We're living in different ways  
It's a beautiful life  
I'm gonna take you to a place I've never been  
before o yeah  
It's a beautiful life  
I'm gonna take you in my arms and fly away with you tonight  
It's a beautiful life, oooh...

It's the Messiah  
  
It must have been something  
Being born in a manger  
With the sheep from the fields  
And stars shining over your head  
It must have been something  
Seeing three wise men  
On their knees before a newborn  
With their eyes all aglow  
'Cause in their hearts they know  
Chorus  
It's the Messiah  
He's come at last  
It's the Messiah  
He's come at last  
It must have been something  
Speaking the word of your Father  
With the promise of life  
And peace, forever  
It must have been something  
Walking the streets of Jerusalem  
With the sins of the world  
On the innocence of a lamb  
But soon everyone will know  
Chorus  
It's the Messiah  
He's come at last  
It's the Messiah  
He's with us at last  
It's the Messiah  
He's come at last  
It's the Messiah  
He's with us at last  
  
  

I woke up this morning with the sundown shining in  
I found my mind in a brown paper bag but then  
I tripped on a cloud and fell-a eight miles high  
I tore my mind on a jagged sky  
I just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in  
  
Yeah, yeah, oh-yeah, what condition my condition was in  
  
I pushed my soul in a deep dark hole and then I followed it in  
I watched myself crawling out as I was a-crawling in  
I got up so tight I couldn't unwind  
I saw so much I broke my mind  
I just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in  
  
Yeah, yeah, oh-yeah, what condition my condition was in  
  
Someone painted April Fool in big black letters on a Dead End sign  
I had my foot on the gas as I left the road and blew out my mind  
Eight miles outta Memphis and I got no spare  
Eight miles straight up downtown somewhere  
I just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in  
  
I said I just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in  
Yeah  
yeah  
oh-yeah

Just remember you're my sunshine  
When I'm with you I don't feel any pain  
Just remember that I love you  
Even if I cannot be your man  
I'm not leaving you forever  
But I got business farther down the line  
You got your troubles baby  
I got mine  
  
Hold on, everything will be alright  
Hold on, I got to have a little more time  
Hold on and together we will find  
All the answers, all we need is time now  
  
Just remember that I love you  
When you got no one to hold your hand  
Yes you know I'll be back home  
Just as soon, just as soon as I can  
  
Hold on, everything will be alright  
Hold on, I got to have a little more time  
Hold on and together we will find  
All the answers, all we need is time now

Oh the weather outside is frightful  
But the fire is so delightful  
And since we've no place to go  
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!  
  
It doesn't show signs of stopping  
And I've bought some corn for popping  
The lights are turned way down low  
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!  
  
When we finally kiss goodnight  
How I'll hate going out in the storm!  
But if you'll really hold me tight  
All the way home I'll be warm  
  
The fire is slowly dying  
And, my dear, we're still goodbying  
But as long as you love me so  
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

Life is a hustle, every day struggle  
Pushing your way at the top  
Gotta keep it on track and never look back  
And no, you don't dare stop.  
  
There's someone behind you keeping an eye on you  
Hoping you take a fall, a lady, she's liked to see me more  
But I can't slow down at all.  
  
She says:  
Wow, I need some time alone  
I say: no, we gotta keep pushing on  
She said: life is good, love is better?  
  
My daddy, he always preached to me  
You gotta reach for the sky  
Make rain while the sun is shining  
Boy, don't let it pass you by  
  
Money and power is in your hand  
You can do what you wanna be  
Oh, my baby, she?s got a different philosophy.  
  
She says:  
Now I know my sweet lady must be heaven sent  
I just cover the meaning of what she meant  
I've been working so hard for the good life but I headed all the while  
I've found my hiding treasure, baby, right there in this smile.  
  
I say:  
Wow, seems we've spent time alone  
  
I say:  
Wow, how our love has grown  
She was right all alone  
  
I say:  
Life is good, love is better?

You've been teaching me a lesson  
That I've never learned  
You never make it through a lifetime  
Without being burned  
Everything I ever thought you were  
You turned out to be  
Since you gave your love to me.  
  
When I met you on a Monday  
My life just stood still  
I belong in every moment  
That your love can fill  
Let me be the only heart you can mend  
Turn out the light and take it right to the end  
  
[Chorus]  
Living with you  
In the madness of my mind  
In a world I could not find  
But you knew what to do  
Living with you  
There's a full moon on the rise  
There?s a fire in your eyes  
And I was born to be.  
  
Loving you under my skin  
You?re everything to me  
I could not love you more  
And you know that you are mine  
And that?s what I?m living for  
  
There will never be a question  
Of somebody new  
I could make it through a lifetime  
With someone like you  
Let me be the only heart ?

This is the house that love built  
Memories of you, built in each wall  
One tender seed still haunt my dreams  
Thought I just heard your voice in the hall  
The mirrors reflect all the heartache I feel  
Smiling photographs, don't seem real  
  
[Chorus: ]  
Nothing's been moved, but everything's changed  
Each chair is in place, just my life's rearranged  
The wind cries your name through each window and door  
Love don't live here, love don't live here anymore  
  
The fire alight still glows a pale blue  
The mantle is cruel holding pictures of you  
Your scent lingers there, in the bed that we shared  
The last plant I sent is in bloom  
These rooms are unkind to play tricks on my mind  
I can see how you've lived without me  
  
[Chorus: ]

Love is a many splendored thing  
It's the April rose that only grows in the early Spring  
Love is nature's way of giving a reason to be living  
The golden crown that makes a man a king  
Once on a high and windy hill, In the morning mist  
Two lovers kissed and the world stood still  
Then your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it how to sing  
Yes, true love's a many splendored thing  
  
Love is a many splendored thing  
It's the April rose that only grows in the early Spring  
Love is nature's way of giving a reason to be living  
The golden crown that makes a man a king  
Once on a high and windy hill, In the morning mist  
Two lovers kissed and the world stood still  
Then your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it how to sing  
Yes, true love's a many splendored thing

I was sinking deep in sin,  
Far from the peaceful shore,  
Very deeply stained within,  
Sinking to rise no more.  
But the Master of the sea  
  
Heard my despairing cry,  
From the waters lifted me.  
Now safe am I.  
  
Love lifted me! Love lifted me!  
When nothing else could help,  
Love lifted me.  
Love lifted me! Love lifted me!  
When nothing else could help  
Love lifted me.  
  
Souls in danger look above  
Jesus completely saves  
He will lift you by his love  
Out of the angry waves  
  
But the master of the sea  
Billows His will obey  
He your savior wants to be  
Be saved today  
  
Love lifted me! Love lifted me!  
When nothing else could help,  
Love lifted me.  
Love lifted me! Love lifted me!  
When nothing else could help  
Love lifted me.

Didn't I make all your dreams come true  
Didn't they work the way you wanted it too  
Didn't I do what I promised to you  
I understand it's just love, love  
So don't give upon love, love, love  
Don't give upon love.  
  
Losing you is so hard for me  
'Cause loving you came so easily  
But we see things so differently  
I understand it's just love.  
  
I'll do what I can to carry on  
'Cause I've loved you before  
I can not love you more  
It's just love, love, love...

Love me tender  
Love me sweet  
Never let me go  
You have made  
My life complete  
And I love you so  
  
[Chorus]  
Love me tender  
Love me true  
All my dreams fulfill  
For, my darlin', I love you  
And I always will  
  
Love me tender  
Love me long  
Take me to your heart  
For it's there that I belong  
And we'll never part  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Love me tender  
Love me dear  
Tell me your are mind  
I'll be your through all the years  
Till the end of time  
  
[Chorus]

I've loved you all my life in all my dreams  
So why am I surprised here with me  
That's how it should be  
But you look in my eyes, turn away  
You can see inside, I'm afraid  
Afraid of feeling.  
  
I don't know what to say  
I don't understand  
It's not the way I planned.  
  
I can't stay, I can't leave  
I'm torn between two people I need  
One of them is you, the other is me  
We come from different world, different stars  
But when you're lying here in my arms  
All I wanna do is love the way you do  
All I wanna do is love the way you do.  
  
How can I go on but nothing's changed  
You and I both know the choice was made  
When I first touched you  
Now if I stay or leave it's all the same  
Awake or in my dreams I see your face  
I will love you  
  
I'm always in control now here I stand  
A heart is in my hand  
  
I can't stay, I can't leave  
I'm torn between two people I need  
One of them is you, the other is me  
We come from different world, different stars  
But when you're lying here in my arms  
All I wanna do is love the way you do  
All I wanna do is love the way you do.

If you could see me now  
The one who said  
That he'd rather roam  
The one who said  
He'd rather be alone  
If you could only see me now  
  
If I could hold you now  
Just for a moment  
If I could really make you mine  
Just for awhile  
Turn back the hands of time  
If I could only hold you now  
  
But I've been too long in the wind  
Too long in the rain  
Takin' any comfort that I can  
Looking back and longing for  
The freedom of my chains  
And lying in your loving arms again  
  
If you could hear me now  
Singing somewhere through the lonely night  
Dreaming of the arms that held me tight  
If you could only hear me now  
  
But I've been too long in the wind  
And too long in the rain  
Takin' any comfort that I can  
Yes, I'm looking back and longing for  
The freedom of my chains  
And lying in your loving arms again  
  
I can almost feel your loving arms again  
If you could hear me now  
If you could see me now  
If you could hear me now

I have never heard this song by Kenny Rogers, and as far as I know a man named
Tom Jans wrote it. The only person I have ever heard sing this song is Elvis
Presley and these are the lyrics as he sings them  
If you could see me now  
The one who said  
That he'd rather roam  
The one who said  
He'd rather be alone  
If you could only see me now  
If I could hold you now  
Just for a moment  
If I could really make you mine  
Just for awhile  
Turn back the hands of time  
If I could only hold you now  
I been too long in the wind  
Too long in the rain  
Takin' any comfort that I can  
Looking back and longing for  
The freedom of my chains  
And lying in you loving arms again  
If you could hear me now  
Singing somewhere in the lonely night  
Dreaming of the arms that held me tight  
If I could only hold you now  
Ooh I been too long in the wind  
Too long in the rain  
Takin' any comfort that I can  
Looking back and longing for  
The freedom of my chains  
And lying in your loving arms again  
I can almost feel your loving arms again

Don't call her up, anymore  
Cos I don't wanna hear your voice  
I don't wanna see your face answer her door.  
Make no mistake, she's mine, she's mine.  
  
She only knows how I feel  
I only know what she's like when she needs me  
Oh how she needs me deep in the night  
Make no mistake, she's mine, no, she's mine.  
  
Don't get too close when you dance  
Cos I don't wanna heart from my friends  
You were out of the town  
With her in your arms.  
  
Don't include her in your dreams  
Cos I don't wanna close my eyes  
No, I don't wanna know where she goes  
Each night when she leaves  
Make no mistake, she's mine, no, she's mine ..  
  
Don't call her up, anymore ...

Mary, did you know  
That your baby boy will one day walk on water?  
  
Mary, did you know  
That your baby boy will save our sons and daughters?  
  
Did you know,  
That your baby boy has come to make you new?  
This child that you've delivered,  
Will soon deliver you.  
  
Mary, did you know  
That your baby boy will give sight to a blind man?  
  
Mary, did you know  
Your baby boy will calm a storm with his hand?  
  
Did you know,  
That your baby boy has walked where angels trod?  
When you kiss your little baby,  
You've kissed the face of god.  
  
The blind will see  
The deaf will hear  
The dead will live again.  
The lame will leap  
The dumb will speak  
The praises of the lamb.  
  
Mary, did you know  
That your baby boy is lord of all creation?  
  
Mary, did you know  
That your baby boy will one day rule the nations?  
  
Did you know,  
That your baby boy is heaven's perfect lamb?  
This sleeping child you're holding, is the great I am.  
  
Happy birthday Jesus!  
A very merry christmas to all of you!  
Please remember  
Jesus is the reason for the season!

Maybe, is a word that hangs between us  
It's the thing to say when all else has failed  
Maybe we failed, maybe  
Maybe, but I can't bare say it's over  
Til the love we found is hopelessly lost  
Maybe I could, maybe not.  
  
Our lives might have come unwound  
But have we've come so far  
That we can't turn the hurt around  
Our hearts still remain the same  
Oh, first to wonder why  
Oh, ask to make a change.  
  
But maybe  
Maybe, if we hold on to tomorrow  
Just hold on, just hold on  
Then we just might find a feeling again  
Not let it end.  
  
Maybe, it's a word that hangs between us  
Maybe, time would help the wondering to stop  
Maybe we will know, maybe not  
Maybe, maybe.

Seems to me that we've been friends forever  
We spend our time together as all good friends will do  
But the silence only lies  
If you could read my eyes  
They hold another feeling  
I could show you  
  
Maybe you should know  
Just how much I love you  
In my heart there's no one else above you  
Maybe I should hope  
You find out for yourself somehow  
Or maybe I should tell you now  
  
Maybe I should wait and take the chances  
A good dancer never dances  
Until he hears the cue  
But the orchestra is gone  
They've left us all alone  
There's no one here to tell me how to tell you  
  
Maybe you should know  
Just how much I love you  
In my heart there's no one else above you  
Maybe I should hope  
You find out for yourself somehow  
Or maybe I should tell you  
Maybe I should tell you  
Maybe I should tell you now  

Busted flat, it baton rouge, headin' for the trains  
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans  
Bobby thumbed a diesel down, just before it rained  
Took us all the way to New Orleans  
  
I took my harpoon out of my old dirty red bandanna  
I was playin' sad while Bobby sang the blues  
With those windshield wipers slappin' time  
And Bobby's clappin' hands we finally  
Sang up every song that driver knew  
  
Oh, oh, oh, freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose  
And nothin' ain't worth nothin', but it's free  
Oh, oh, oh, feelin' good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues  
I'm feeling good was good enough for me, Bobby Mcgee  
  
From the coal mines of Kentucky to the California sun  
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul  
Standing right beside me, Lord, through everything I'd done  
And every night she kept me from the cold  
  
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord, I let her slip away  
Looking for that home and I hope she'll find  
I'll trade all of my tomorrows for a single yesterday  
Holdin' bobby's body next to mine  
  
Oh, oh, oh, freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose  
And nothin' left was all she left for me  
Oh, oh, oh, feelin' good was easy, Lord when Bobby sang the blues  
Feeling good was good enough for me and by Mcgee  
  
Oh, oh, oh, freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose  
And nothin' ain't worth nothin', but it's free  
Oh, oh, oh, feelin' good was easy, Lord

Rain comes down on a misty bay  
Light on the water and she?s coming my way  
To be fair she?s only wearing a smile  
Ease all my trouble just by driving me wild  
  
And like moon don?t function without the night  
We come together and she?s hanging on tight  
She makes me tremble like I never before  
Bringing me up to keep me begging for more  
  
In every hour to be, let me satisfy your heart  
I can take the lonely days  
In return for the midsummer nights.  
  
[Chorus]  
We know the journey to a better life, better life  
And we never to be letting go  
You got to learn to be lonely to find  
What you?re living for  
Making love on a midsummer night  
I love those midsummer nights, ?  
  
There may be one fool falling in love with you  
You are the vision that I?m hanging on to  
Any world, any dream you can see  
Is yours and mine if we just want it to be  
  
Let me lie in your arms  
Let me understand your heart  
I can take the lonely days  
In return for those midsummer nights  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Making your love to me only  
Running forever, I?m following you  
And I'm not afraid  
For every hour to be  
Let me satisfy your heart  
I can take the lonely days  
In return for those midsummer nights

Look at me  
I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree  
Ah, I'm walkin' on a cloud  
I can't understand, Lord  
I'm misty holdin' your hand  
  
Walk my way  
And a thousand violins begin to play  
Or it might be the sound of your "hello"  
That music I hear, Lord  
I'm misty the moment you're near  
  
You can say that you're leadin' me on  
But it's just what I want you to do  
Don't ya notice how hopelessly I'm lost  
That's why I'm followin' you  
  
Ooh, on my own  
Should I wander through this wonderland alone, now  
Never knowin' my right foot from my left  
My hat from my glove, Lord  
I'm misty, and too much in love  
  
You can say that you're leadin' me on  
But it's just what I want you to do  
Don't ya notice how hopelessly I'm lost  
That's why I'm followin' you  
  
Ooh, on my own  
Should I wander through this wonderland alone, now  
Never knowin' my right foot from my left  
My hat from my glove, Lord  
I'm misty, and too much in love  
  
(Misty) too much in love  
(Misty) too much in love  
(Misty)  
(Misty) too much in love...

Here it is seven in the a.m.  
It's gonna take more then wakin' to rise me  
I wake up with this need again  
But feel the love of the woman beside me  
It's just one of those days  
When I wanna lay here with her  
And love her before I leave  
And listen to the rain fall on the roof  
And the thunder sounds like horses hooves  
Oh, I listen to her breathe  
And it makes me wanna wake her up  
And tell her that I'm on fire  
With morning desire  
It looks like I'm gonna be late again  
And I gonna give up and get movin' and I'm tryin'  
But the longer I keep stalling  
The more I think about callin' in and lying  
It's just one of those days  
When I wanna stay here with her  
And watch her while she sleeps  
And listen to the rain fall on the roof  
And the thunder sounds like horses hooves  
Oh, I listen to her breathe  
And it makes me wanna wake her up  
And tell her that I'm on fire  
With morning desire  
Well, I love to hear the rain fallin' on the roof  
And the thunder sounds like horses hooves  
Oh, I listen to her breathe  
And it makes me wanna wake her up  
And tell her that I'm on fire  
With morning desire, with morning desire  
Listen to the rain  
Listen to the rain  
Listen to the rain  
...  

My funny valentine, sweet comic valentine  
You make me smile with my heart  
Your looks are laughable, unphotographable  
Yet you're my favorite work of art  
  
Is your figure less than Greek?  
Is your mouth a little weak?  
When you open it to speak  
Are you smart?  
  
Don't change a hair for me  
Not if you care for me  
Stay little valentine, stay  
Each day is Valentine's Day  
  
You're my favorite work of art  
  
Is your figure less than Greek?  
Is your mouth a little weak?  
When you open it to speak  
Are you smart? Oh  
  
Don't change your hair for me  
Not if you care for me  
Stay little valentine, stay  
Each day is Valentine's Day

The wages of an unskilled working man never paid enough  
From time to time a nickel on a race keeps him from giving up  
  
A blue collared man in Seattle never lives on white collared street  
But there was food on the table for my Washington woman and me  
  
The work slowed down and the one day  
The foreman laid me off  
That night in a tavern down on my last dime  
I met a girl from Arkensal  
  
Her daddy was a banker in Little Rock  
She had a mansion on white collared street  
The next morning my Washington woman woke up without me  
  
From city to city, and state to state, I get her in shame  
My Washington woman had six months left  
Before out child would bring her pain  
  
That Arkensal woman hurt me  
As we crossed the Arkensal line  
But the arms of Seattle  
Are the arms that kept huggin' mine  
  
For year I have basked in expensive wines  
Taste champagne every day  
I gave up all the things I loved  
For all these things I hate  
  
I locked up all of her forgiveness, the day I set myself free  
And the heart of my Washington woman stopped beating for me  
  
My Washington woman sends me a letter every once in a while  
Inside a folded wordless page is a picture of my child  
All but words, the room grows cold with a feeling of jealousy  
And there's a silence between  
My Arkensal woman and me

My world was no more than a dream  
And waitin' on a dream can sure get lonely  
Your love just fell right into place  
And filled and empty space to overflowing, overflowing  
My world begins with havin' a friend when I'm feeling blue  
My world would end if ever I heard you say we were through  
Just don't know what I'd do  
'Cause my world begins and ends with you  
Sometimes I tell little lies to see if your eyes are looking through me  
But you know lying's not my style  
I just need your smile coming to me  
Reassuring me  
My world begins with havin' a friend when I'm feeling blue  
My world would end if ever I heard you say we were through  
Just don't know what I'd do  
'Cause my world begins and ends with you

Girl, don't wait you-up tonight  
Don't leave on the light  
'Cause you'll be sleepin' alone again  
I know my intentions were the best  
I had it all worked out, you see  
But you deserve a whole lot better than me  
  
[Chorus:]  
You need a man  
Whose heart is only one place in the night  
Who'll stay right here and just be satisfied  
You need a man  
Who won't disappoint you every time  
Who'll call and say our plans have changed  
So don't wait up tonight  
  
Stop me now  
I've gone and talked too much again  
You know I do that now and then  
So pay no attention to me  
If I-I say your name  
A thousand times again and again  
Just don't listen to me  
  
[Chorus]

You ask me if someday  
You'll hear me say goodbye  
I couldnt walk away  
If I tried.  
  
Oh I know  
My feelings go  
Unspoken sometimes  
  
Chorus  
You can put all your tears away  
This time forever's here to stay  
I know a love like yours and mine  
Happens only once in a lifetime.  
  
I hold you close to me  
And our love comes alive  
I never dreamed I could be  
So satisfied  
  
If fate is kind  
Just once we find  
Such heaven in this life  
Repeat Chorus  
  
Bridge  
I might see lightening strike  
Twice in the same place  
But I know I'd never see  
Love like you've given me.

People in love  
They've got it all  
They've got the world in their hands  
Chosen their eyes  
There's no way to hide  
Of the love that we had  
  
People in love  
Live everyday  
Knowing each other by heart  
A power of two  
Leading them through  
Like a torch in the dark  
  
Yesterday  
Love seemed so far away  
I never dreamed I could be  
One of those people in love  
  
But I found you  
To give up my love in two  
Only you  
I never dreamed we could be  
Two of those people in love  
  
People in love take care forever  
Knowing someone truly cares  
Love is the key  
Of those who believe  
Of a lifetime to share

Planet Texas  
  
They rode like they was Rangers as they came out of the skies  
They had High-Tech horses with beacons in their eyes  
My gun was cocked and ready when I looked into their face  
I seen they just weren't just common buck-a-roos born of the human race  
No, sir, these Cowboys came from space  
Their shootin' irons shot laser light and their spurs was anodized  
Bandanas caked with stardust and their jeans was pressurized  
Well he handed me a halter, said, "Tighten up the girth."  
But before I hit the saddle we were miles above the Earth.  
And I mean MILES above the Earth  
Yippie-aye-ay-e  
I seen London, Paris, Budapest, Kashmir and Tokyo  
And there ain't no sight like a desert night looking down on Mexico  
To the Moons of Mars and Jupiter, 'round Saturn's rings we rode  
Past the frozen plains of Pluto where even the sunshine's cold  
Man, I do mean COLD  
Then our interstellar stallions sailed through the starless void  
There was nothing to miss in that emptiness, not even a stray asteroid  
So we picked up the trail of a comet tail, man, you can't even DREAM that far  
And the galloping beat like the rhythm of an old catgut guitar  
Just the strummin' of a distant star  
Yippie-aye-ay-e  
Well, it could have lasted minutes or a hundred thousand years  
When they got me down, I was safe and sound and it hadn't even popped my ears  
And they reared back on their broncos and they shot a bolt of light  
I knew they were the good guys, yes, sir. you got it right  
'Cause their cowboy hats was White  
So I asked 'em as they pulled their reins towards the settin' sun  
I said, "Before you go, I'd like to know, just where you boys come from?"  
Well they opened up a star chart and said, "right here where this 'X' is  
It's the biggest place in Outer Space, the planet known as Texas"  
Yippie-aye-ay-e  
Yippie-aye-ay-e  
Yippie-aye-ay-e  
Yippie-aye-ay-e  
  

Lady,  
Lady, I'm your knight in shining armor and I love you.  
You have made me what I am, and I am yours.  
My love, there's so many ways I want to say I love you.  
Let me hold you in my arms forever more.  
You have gone and made me such a fool.  
I'm so lost in your love.  
And oh, we belong together,  
Won't you believe in my song?  
Lady, for so many years I thought I'd never find you.  
You have come into my life and made me whole.  
Forever let me wake to see you each and every morning.  
Let me hear you whisper softly in my ear.  
In my eyes I see no one else but you.  
There's no other love like our love.  
And yes, oh yes, I'll always want you near me.  
I've waited for you so long.  
Lady, your love's the only love I need,  
And beside me is where I want you to be.  
'Cause, my love, there's something I want you to know,  
You're the love of my life, you're my lady.

We only knew each other by letter,  
When I met her over the train,  
When the smoke cleared and the dust was still,  
She was standing there speaking my name.  
  
I guarantee she looked like an angel,  
I couldn't think of what I should say,  
But when Adam saw Eve in the garden,  
I believe he felt the selfsame way.  
  
I handed her up on the wagon,  
And I loaded up her trunk behind,  
She was sitting up there with the gold in her hair,  
I tried to get a hope on my mind.  
  
You think that you could love me, Mary? ,  
You think we got a chance of a life,  
Do you think that you could love me, Mary?  
Now you are to be my wife.  
  
We finally headed out of the station,  
And drove up my home trail,  
And when we came to the farm she laid a hand on my arm,  
I thought my resolution would fail.  
  
Now froze as she stepped through the doorway,  
And I stood there as still as could be,  
I said: "I know, it ain't much it needs a woman's touch,  
Perhaps she turned around and looked at me."  
  
Do you think that ...  
  
We had a prairie wedding,  
There was a preacher and a neighbor or two,  
I gave my golden thing, a gold wedding ring,  
And the both of us said, "I do".  
  
Now when the sun is going down in the prairie,  
And the golden hair is a flame,  
I say "do you really love me, Mary?"  
I hold her and I whisper her name.  
  
Do you think that...

Pretty little baby, lying in a manger  
Staring at the strangers, who?ve come so many miles  
They were told to follow the star up in the heavens  
And it brought them to the stable of the little baby child.  
  
Could this be the kingdom of the high and mighty  
Is this the ruler, born here tonight  
Should we lay our treasures, here by the cradle  
Oh, you must be the savior, pretty little baby child.  
  
[Chorus]  
Sometimes the greatest of miracles  
Come from the smallest of things  
They knew when they knelt there beside him  
They were looking in the eyes of the king.  
And that his tiny little fingers would bring us together  
For ever and ever, pretty little baby child.  
  
Wonder of wonders, there in the darkness  
The light of the promise, how it shines from his eyes  
The angels were singing the hallelujah chorus  
To the savior before us. Pretty little baby child.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
For ever and ever pretty little baby child

They say that it's a matter of trusting  
Before love has a chance to begin  
And it's never simple  
Faithless hearts can cripple  
And only a strong love survives  
I know they say that it's a fine line  
Between giving up and giving in  
But once your heart's been in it  
You just can't forget it  
It's like nothing that you've felt in your life  
  
[Chorus:]  
We got real love  
Not infatuation  
Real love  
Our hearts' celebration  
I love you  
Real love  
Not an imitation  
Real love  
You're my destination  
Baby, you and me  
We got everything we need  
  
You are such a part of my life  
That I can't remember me without you  
And we've had our nights  
We've had our share of fights  
But we've never thought of giving it up  
  
Oh, you and I we must be dreamers  
'Cause we're making our dreams come true  
I could spend my life  
Just holding you so tight  
And never, ever get enough  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We got real love  
  
[Repeat Chorus]

Ruben James, in my song you live again  
And the phrases that I rhyme  
Are just the footsteps out of time  
From the time when I knew you Ruben James  
  
Ruben James all the folks around Madison County  
Cussed your name just a no  
Count share croppin' colored man  
Who would steal anything he can  
And they always laid the blame on Ruben James  
  
Ruben James, you still walk furrowed fields on my mind  
The faded skirt the weathered brow  
The calloused hand up on the plow  
I loved you then and I love you now Ruben James  
Flora James, Ruben James  
  
Gray, a gossip of Madison County died with child  
And although your skin was black  
It was you that would not turn your back  
On a hungry white child with no name, Ruben James  
  
Ruben James, with your mind on my soul  
And the bible in your right hand  
You said turn the other cheek  
A better world is a waiting for the meek  
In my head those words remain from Ruben James  
  
Ruben James one dark cloudy day  
That brought you from the fields  
And to your lonely pine box came  
Just a preacher, me and the rain  
To sing one last refrain for Ruben James

His daddy was an honest man, red dirt Georgia farmer  
His mama lived her short life having kids and baling hay  
He had fifteen years, an ache inside to wander  
He hopped a freight in Waycross, wound up in L.A.  
  
Lord, the cold nights had no pity on a Waycross Georgia farm boy  
Most days he went hungry, then the summer came  
He met a girl known on the strip as San Francisco's Mabel Joy  
Destitutions child born of an L.A. street called shame  
  
Growing up came quietly in the arms of Mabel Joy  
Laughter found their mornings, brought a meaning to his life  
Yes, the night before she left, sleep came and left that Waycross  
Country boy with dreams of Georgia cotton and a California wife  
  
Sunday morning found him standing 'neath the red light of her door  
When a right cross sent him reeling, put him face down on the floor  
In place of Mabel Joy he found a merchant mad marine  
He growled that Georgia neck is red, but sonny your still green  
  
He turned twenty-one in a gray rock federal prison  
The old judge had no mercy for a Waycross Georgia boy  
Starin' at those four gray, in silence he would listen  
That midnight freight he knew would take him back to Mabel Joy  
  
Sunday morning found him lyin' 'neath the red light of her door  
With a bullet in his side he cried have you seen Mabel Joy  
Stunned and shaken someone said she's not here no more  
She left this house four years today  
  
They say she's looking for some Georgia farm boy

Saying goodbye  
  
I watched every sun up  
Comin' over my tin cup  
Seen every moon changin'  
While I slept with the sky  
Felt the chill in the north wind  
Find holes that I can't mend  
This West Texas cowboy is wrestless again.  
  
Campfire light dancin'  
On the smiles of some good friends  
Wearin' the hard times  
In the lines on their faces  
Now the seasons are changin'  
And it's time I was leavin'  
'Cause this West Texas cowboy is wrestless again.  
  
So I'm sayin' goodbye-ye, ridin' away  
Sayin' goodbye-ye again  
I'm wishin' you well, miss you until  
I come back again next year.  
  
Let's sing of the good days  
And drink to the ladies  
Till the whisky's all gone  
And their pleasure is mine  
Come sit here beside me  
Sweet lullaby me  
This West Texas cowboy is wrestless again....

Open the windows, Virginia,  
Let the wind blow the papers away.  
Don't know if you've got it in ya'.  
Just like a dunce in the eighth grade,  
You'll soon be an old maid,  
School teacher, rule creature, cool creature, school teacher.  
  
You're a beginner, Virginia,  
Simple arithmetic shows a delay.  
Do all the sums deep within 'ya,  
Oh yes, and then assign the grade,  
You'll soon be an old maid,  
School teacher, rule creature, cool creature, school teacher.  
  
Your soul's in limbo, Virginia,  
You found a formula for your mistakes.  
God doesn't know where to send 'ya,  
The Bible's black opaque keepsakes,  
When your red hair's turning grey,  
School teacher, rule creature, cool creature, school teacher.

Take my hand, pull me up  
Find my own way soon enough  
You'll see me through, see me through  
What you give will see me through  
When my mind cannot reach  
You can show me harmony  
That sees me through, sees me through  
What you teach will see me through  
You told me, you showed me  
And when you're working day was done  
I watched you go, I should have known  
That even when I feel alone  
You'll see me through, see me through  
When I need you, you'll see me through  

It's an ill wind that blows no good  
And it's a sad heart that won't love like it should  
Oh how lonesome you must be  
And it's a shame  
If you don't share your love with me  
  
It's a heartache when love is gone  
And it can get even worse if it keeps on  
Blinder than he who won't see  
And it's a shame  
If you don't share your love with me  
  
I can't help it  
If he (she) is gone  
You must try to forget  
You must live on  
It's a good thing to love someone  
But it's bad and even sad  
When it's not returned  
Oh how lonesome you must be  
And it's a shame  
If you don't share your love with me  
And I said it's a shame  
If you don't share your love with me

I am only one of those who care  
Who care about the faith of love  
I know there's many others just like me  
I know they two ain't had enough  
Cos this heart's doin' battle on the front line  
Love's got no heroes in these modern times  
What love needs is a defender  
I am a soldier of love.  
  
I see it in your eyes you felt the heat  
There was a time when you believed  
Love is the only way to make it thro'  
Or be another casualty  
From that heart's doin' battle on the front line  
Love's got no heroes in these modern times  
What love needs is a defender  
I am a soldier of love.
