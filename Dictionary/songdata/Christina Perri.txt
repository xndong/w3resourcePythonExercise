How the hell does a broken heart  
Get back together when it's torn apart  
Teach itself to start  
Beating again ba ba ba ba  
  
This little Bluebird came looking for you  
I said that I hadn't seen you in quite some time  
This little Bluebird, she came looking again  
I said we weren't even friends she could have you  
  
Don't you think it was hard?  
I didn't even say that you died  
But it wouldn't have been such a lie  
'Cause then I started to cry  
  
This little Bluebird sure won't give it a rest  
She swears that you may be better than all the rest  
I said no-oh  
You've got it all wrong  
If he was something special, I wouldn't have this song  
  
Don't you think it was hard?  
I didn't even say that you died  
But it wouldn't have been such a lie  
'Cause then I started to cry  
  
How the hell does a broken heart  
Get back together when it's torn apart?  
Teach itself to start  
Beating again ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba  
  
What if when she comes over I am in your arms?  
Taking all I want from you again  
  
(Ba ba ba ba)  
  
How the hell does a broken heart  
Get back together when it's torn apart  
Teach itself to start  
Beating again ba ba ba ba  
  
How the hell does a broken heart  
Get back together when it's torn apart  
Teach itself to start  
Beating again ba ba ba ba  
Beating again ba ba ba ba  
  
This little bluebird don't come 'round here anymore  
So I went looking for her  
And I found  
You

Everyone thinks I'm crazy  
For thinking that when you see me  
You're gonna love me  
  
But I tell them it's easy  
Like loving is supposed to be  
  
Walk into the room love  
I'll be waiting  
Miles and miles and miles oh my love  
I've come to find  
Find you  
  
Must request a dance or two  
Until morning ruins  
All my plans for you  
  
Strangely I don't give a damn  
About his circumstance  
Or hang-up for you  
  
Walk beside this lullaby love  
For dreams of you and I love  
Miles and miles and miles oh my love  
I've come to find  
Find you  
  
How  
Many ways  
Can I explain  
My love  
For you  
  
Without  
Sounding like a little girl  
Looking up to you  
  
Taught  
Me everything  
Yes you taught  
  
... Taught me pain  
And because of you I've changed  
  
Everyone thinks I'm crazy  
For thinking that when you see me  
You're gonna love me

Finally your time has come  
Now's my chance to turn and run  
Like I always do  
  
Build a story in my head  
It was love before we met  
Happy, with my idea with you  
  
Stay where you are  
Please don't break my heart  
  
Love you in my daydream  
Don't open your mouth, open your mouth  
Everything I'll ever need  
Spoil it now, spoil it now  
You stood up and I fell down  
  
Watching me, watching you  
I know what you wanna do  
But I'm afraid of my wish coming true  
  
So I paint a picture in my mind, that  
I go back to older times  
It's better than being with you  
  
Stay where you are  
Please don't break my heart  
  
Love you in my daydream  
Don't open your mouth, open your mouth  
Everything I'll ever need  
Spoil it now, spoil it now  
You stood up and I fell down  
  
I don't know how to come down  
I was lost and now I am found  
You stood up and I fell down  
  
Love you in my daydream  
Don't open your mouth, open your mouth  
Everything I'll ever need  
Spoil it now, spoil it now  
  
Love you in my daydream  
Don't open your mouth, open your mouth  
Everything I'll ever need  
Spoil it now, spoil it now  
  
Love you in my daydream

The sun is filling up the room,  
And I can hear you dreaming.  
Do you feel the way I do, right now?  
  
I wish we would just give up,  
'Cause the best part is falling.  
Calling anything but love.  
  
And I will make sure to keep my distance,  
Say I love you when you're not listening,  
How long, can we keep this up, up, up?  
  
Please don't stand so close to me  
I'm having trouble breathing.  
I'm afraid of what you'll see, right now.  
  
I'll give you everything I am,  
All my broken heartbeats.  
Until I know you'll understand.  
  
And I will make sure to keep my distance,  
Say I love you when you're not listening,  
How long, can we keep this up, up, up?  
  
And I keep waiting  
For you to take me  
And you keep waiting  
To save what we had  
  
So I'll make sure to keep my distance,  
Say I love you when you're not listening,  
How long, can we keep this up, up, up?  
  
Make sure to keep my distance,  
Say I love you when you're not listening,  
How long, 'til we call this love, love, love?

Woke up such a bad dream  
I stayed, you were leaving  
With my heart, you were stealing  
I don't care, I'd let you take it  
  
Showed up, like a good girl  
I fell for your fable  
But I'm no Cinderella  
I don't care, I'd let you take it  
  
Put us back together  
You said, it's forever  
But I know you're pretending  
I don't care, I'd let you take it  
All again  
  
And I just wanna love you  
Don't wanna lose me  
Don't wanna lose you, whoa oh  
If it gets harder  
Then I don't wanna break all alone  
I wanna break in your  
  
I just wanna love you  
Don't wanna lose me  
Don't wanna lose you, whoa oh  
If it gets harder  
Then I don't wanna break all alone  
I wanna break in your  
  
Whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh  
(Don't wanna break in your)  
  
And if it gets harder  
Then I don't wanna break all alone  
I wanna break in your arms  
  
Sometimes, when I'm sleeping  
I still, feel you breathing  
You stole, all my good dreams  
I don't care, I'd let you take it  
  
Come on, listen closely  
To the sound, that our love made  
If you go, I would follow  
I don't care, I'd let you take it,  
All again  
  
I just wanna love you  
Don't wanna lose me  
Don't wanna lose you, whoa oh  
If it gets harder  
Then I don't wanna break all alone  
I wanna break in your  
  
And I just wanna love you  
Don't wanna lose me  
Don't wanna lose you, whoa oh  
If it gets harder  
Then I don't wanna break all alone  
I wanna break in your  
  
Whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh, whoa oh  
  
And if it gets harder  
Then I don't wanna break all alone  
I wanna break in your  
  
Whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh (Don't wanna break in your)  
Whoa oh oh (Don't wanna break in your arms)  
Whoa oh oh (Don't wanna break in your)  
Whoa oh oh (Don't wanna break in your arms)  
Whoa oh oh (Don't wanna break in your arms)  
Whoa oh oh (Don't wanna break in your arms)  
Whoa oh oh, whoa oh  
  
And I just wanna love you  
Don't wanna lose me  
Don't wanna lose you, whoa oh  
If it gets harder  
Then I don't wanna break all alone  
I wanna break in your arms

I know I can't take one more step towards you  
'Cause all that's waiting is regret  
Don't you know I'm not your ghost anymore  
You lost the love I loved the most  
  
I learned to live, half alive  
And now you want me one more time  
  
[Chorus]  
Who do you think you are?  
Runnin' 'round leaving scars  
Collecting your jar of hearts  
And tearing love apart  
You're gonna catch a cold  
From the ice inside your soul  
So don't come back for me  
Who do you think you are?  
  
I hear you're asking all around  
If I am anywhere to be found  
But I have grown too strong  
To ever fall back in your arms  
  
I've learned to live, half alive  
And now you want me one more time  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It took so long just to feel alright  
Remember how to put back the light in my eyes  
I wish I had missed the first time that we kissed  
'Cause you broke all your promises  
And now you're back  
You don't get to get me back  
  
Who do you think you are?  
Runnin' 'round leaving scars  
Collecting your jar of hearts  
And tearing love apart  
You're gonna catch a cold  
From the ice inside your soul  
Don't come back for me  
Don't come back at all  
  
Who do you think you are?  
Runnin' 'round leaving scars  
Collecting your jar of hearts  
Tearing love apart  
You're gonna catch a cold  
From the ice inside your soul  
Don't come back for me  
Don't come back at all  
  
Who do you think you are?  
Who do you think you are?  
Who do you think you are?

Greeting cards have all been sent,  
The Christmas rush is through,  
But I still have one wish to make,  
A special one for you.  
  
Merry Christmas, darling  
We're apart, that's true  
But I can dream and in my dreams  
I'm Christmas-ing with you.  
  
Holidays are joyful,  
There's always something new.  
But every day's a holiday  
When I'm near to you.  
The lights on my tree,  
I wish you could see,  
I wish it every day.  
Logs on the fire  
Fill me with desire  
To see you and to say  
  
That I wish you Merry Christmas,  
Happy New Year, too.  
I've just one wish  
On this Christmas Eve  
I wish I were with you.  
  
Logs on the fire  
Fill me with desire  
To see you and to say  
That I wish you Merry Christmas,  
Happy New Year, too  
I've just one wish  
On this Christmas Eve  
I wish I were with you  
I wish I were with you  
  
Merry, Merry, Merry Christmas,  
Merry Christmas, darling!

I feel the way you want me  
I see that you are lonely  
If you couldn't know, you'd leave with me  
It's more than curiosity  
And I've never longed for winter  
Till your presence made me shiver  
Untethered you'd be better if you'd only come with me  
  
One night I will be the moon  
Hanging over you  
(Spilling all over your body)  
(Covering all your wounds)  
One night I will be the star  
Follow where you are  
(Swimming in the depth of my love)  
(Filling your empty heart)  
One night, one night, one night  
One night, one night, one night  
  
You've come so close to tasting  
Now my innocence is breaking  
Like the ocean in a perfect storm  
It makes me want you even more  
And I've never been so jealous  
I've never felt so helpless  
So out of breath and hungry for you  
  
One night I will be the moon  
Hanging over you  
(Spilling all over your body)  
(Covering all your wounds)  
One night I will be a star  
Follow where you are  
(Swimming in the depth of my love)  
(Filling your empty heart)  
One night, one night, one night  
One night, one night, one night  
  
Hurry, the sun is waking  
Darling, don't leave me waiting  
  
One night I will be the moon  
Hanging over you  
(Spilling all over your body)  
(Covering all your wounds)  
One night I will be the star  
Follow where you are  
(Swimming in the depth of my love)  
(Filling your empty heart)  
One night, one night, one night  
One night, one night, one night  
One night, one night, one night  
One night, one night, one night

Can you find the time  
To let your lover love you  
He only wants to show you  
The things he wants to learn too  
The hardest parts you'll get through  
And in the end you'll have your best friend  
  
[Chorus]  
Love like this may come once  
Baby it's fate  
Like a soul mate he's your penguin  
Baby it's fate  
Baby it's fate  
Not luck  
  
Can you find the time to let your lover hold you  
He needs somebody to hold to  
His love is strong and so true  
His arrows aiming for you  
And he's the one that you were born to love  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Let go  
Let go  
Of time for you  
And I  
Let go  
Let go  
Of time for you  
And I  
Let go  
Let go  
Of time for you  
And I  
  
Love like this is all I want  
Baby we're fate  
Love like this may come once  
Baby we're fate  
Like a soul mate your my penguin  
Baby we're fate  
Baby it's fate  
Not luck

Why do I breathe  
With what's beating in my chest?  
You'd think I'd learn better now  
'Cause I can't get any rest  
'Cause I  
Keep trying  
To find happiness  
In everybody else  
  
Please move that finger  
That's been pointing to my mistakes  
I want no part  
In the feelings you worst make  
So let go  
And let me love you today  
  
And you're so damn difficult  
You'd lose a heart in your hand  
And I can't believe you'd make me work for it  
Now I understand  
Why I run as fast as I can  
  
And I can feel everything  
I can feel your emptiness  
And I don't believe  
There's a way out of this mess,  
Unless, I  
Can forgive  
All your sins  
I will not  
I'll never laugh again  
Again  
  
See right through  
My words  
See I'm just like you  
Watch me stomp on my sweet shoes  
All your lies  
All your lies  
All your lies  
  
You're so damn difficult  
You'd lose a heart in your hand  
And I can't believe you'd make me work for it  
Now I understand  
Why I run as fast as I can

Today I'm gonna write a sad song  
Gonna make it really long  
So that everyone can see  
That I'm very unhappy  
  
I wish I wasn't always wrong  
I wish it wasn't always my fault  
The finger that your pointing has knocked me on my knees  
And all you need to know is I'm so sorry  
  
It's not like me  
It's maturity that I'm lacking  
So don't, don't let me go  
Just let me know that growing up goes slow.  
  
I wonder what my mom and dad would say  
If I told them that I cry each day  
It's hard enough to live so far away  
  
I wish I wasn't always cold  
I wish it wasn't always alone  
When the party is over how will I get home?  
  
And all you need to know is I'm so sorry  
It's not like me  
It's maturity that I'm lacking  
So don't, don't let me go  
Just let me know that growing up goes slow.  
  
If all the rules are meant to bend  
And you swore you were my friend  
Now I have to start all over again  
  
Cause no ones going to take your place  
And I'm scared I'll never save  
All the pieces of the love we made.  
  
And I'm so sorry, it's not like me  
It's maturity that I'm lacking  
So don't, don't let me go  
Just let me know that I can slip and fall  
  
And you won't let me go just to let me know  
That growing up goes slow.  
  
And I'm so sorry, Its not like me  
Its maturity that I'm lacking  
So don't, don't let me go  
Just let me know that growing up goes slow

High, we get so high  
But we fall down  
It's no surprise  
It's here we go, fighting  
There you go again  
  
Light on your own  
Let this love  
Turn to stone  
There we go, fighting  
There you go again  
Here we go again  
  
So let me go, let me go  
I don't know how we grow  
Something incredible  
Oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh  
You shot me in the heart this time  
I hope you know, hope you know  
You let it go  
Lost it all, something incredible  
Oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh  
You shot me in the heart this time  
  
Don't call me home  
You only gave what you've stole  
There I go, hurting  
There I go again  
Here we go again  
  
So let me go, let me go  
I don't know how we grow  
Something incredible  
Oh oh-oh, oh oh, oh oh  
You shot me in the heart this time  
I hope you know, hope you know  
You let it go  
Lost it all, something incredible  
Oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh  
You shot me in the heart this time  
  
Only try to make you  
Only try to make you mine  
Only try to make you  
Only try to make you mine  
  
So let me go, let me go  
I don't know how we grow  
Something incredible  
Oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh  
You shot me in the heart this time  
I hope you know, hope you know  
You let it go  
Lost it all, something incredible  
Oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh  
You shot me in the heart this time  
Shot me in the heart this time  
Shot me in the heart this time

All of the lights land on you  
The rest of the world fades from you  
And all of the love I see  
Please please say you feel it too  
And all of the noise I hear inside  
Restless and loud, unspoken and wild  
And all that you need to say  
To make it all go away  
It's that you feel the same way too  
  
And I know  
The scariest part is letting go  
'Cause love is a ghost you can't control  
I promise you the truth can't hurt us now  
So let the words slip out of your mouth  
  
And all of the steps that led me to you  
And all of the hell I had you walk through  
But I wouldn't trade a day for the chance to say  
My love, I'm in love with you  
  
And I know  
The scariest part is letting go  
'Cause love is a ghost you can't control  
I promise you the truth can't hurt us now  
So let the words slip out of your mouth  
  
I know that we're both afraid  
We both made the same mistakes  
An open heart is an open wound to you  
And in the wind there's a heavy choice  
Love has a quiet voice  
Still you mind, now I'm yours to choose  
  
And I know  
The scariest part is letting go  
Let my love be the light that guides you home  
  
And I know  
The scariest part is letting go  
'Cause love is a ghost you can't control  
I promise you the truth can't hurt us now  
So let the words slip out of your mouth

Can't believe my eyes  
Could they possibly be deceiving me on the other side  
Of the picture screen your kissing  
Somebody  
  
I laugh because you say she's wonderful  
I laugh because you say she's wonderful  
And she's nothing like me  
  
How long must I wait for my jealousy to take a break?  
You know it's so unlike me to secretly wanna fight with faith  
It's really you that I hate  
  
But I laugh because you say she's wonderful  
I laugh because you say she's wonderful  
And she's nothing like me  
  
I wanna know what this means  
There remains a slate to be clean  
Please don't' let this, don't let become  
The death of me  
  
Forgive me  
Forgive me
