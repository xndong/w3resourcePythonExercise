I'm feeling out of bound, out of bounds  
I'm running out of time, out of time  
I know there's no such thing as either of them but  
It doesn't make me feel any better  
  
Out of sight, out of mind  
Out of sight, out of mind  
We're out of time, we're out of mind,  
out of mind, out of mind  
Yeah (yeah), yeah  
  
I'm feeling overwhelmed, overwhelmed  
It's getting out of line, line, line, line  
I know I'm not alone, just adolescents you and I  
It doesn't make me feel any better  
  
Out of sight, out of mind  
Out of sight, out of mind  
We're out of time, we're out of mind,  
out of mind, out of mind  
Yeah (yeah), yeah  
Yeah (yeah), yeah  
  
Out of sight, out of mind  
Out of sight, out of mind  
We're out of time, we're out of mind,  
out of mind, out of mind  
we're out of mind,  
Yeah yeah, yeah

Two people touching lips  
Hands on each others hips  
Nothing else in the world but one another  
The forty second floor  
On a distant shore  
I wonder how we strayed so far from this  
  
Remember when we were  
Just flesh and bone you sir  
May have forgotten how good your world can be  
So put down your hollow tips  
And kiss you lovers lips  
And know that fate is what we make of it  
Please end this please end this before it ends us, ends us, ends  
  
I want to stay inside  
I want to stay inside for good  
I want to stay inside for good for good for good for good  
  
I read the news today  
And everything they say  
Just makes me want to stay inside and wait  
But the better part of me knows  
That waiting in the throws  
Is on a par with reading while my eyes are closed  
  
"what can I do"? you say  
"its just another day  
In the life of apes with ego trips!"  
Put down your hollow tips  
And kiss your lovers lips  
And know that fate is what we make of it  
  
Please end this please end this before it ends us, ends us, ends us  
I want to stay inside  
I want to stay inside for good  
I want to stay inside for good for good  
Oh  
I'm gonna stay inside  
I'm gonna stay inside for good  
I'm gonna stay inside for good for good  
I want to stay inside  
I want to stay inside for good  
I want to stay inside  
Don't want to stay inside for good  
Don't want to stay inside for good for good for good

A cloud hangs over  
This city by the sea  
I watch the ships pass and wonder if she might be  
Out there and sober, as a well for loneliness  
Please do persist girl, it's time we met and made a mess  
  
I picture your face in the back of my eyes  
A fire in the attic, a proof of the prize  
Anna Molly, Anna Molly, Anna Molly  
Doo, doo, doo, doo, do  
Doo, doo, doo, doo, do  
  
A cloud hangs over  
And mutes my happiness  
A thousand ships couldn't sail me back from distress  
Wish you were here  
I'm a wounded satellite  
I need you now, put me back together, make me right  
  
I picture your face in the back of my eyes  
A fire in the attic, a proof of the prize  
Anna Molly, Anna Molly, Anna Molly  
I'll call out your name  
Up into the air  
Not one of the others  
Could ever compare  
Anna Molly, Anna Molly  
  
Wait, there is a light  
There is a fire, illuminated attic  
Fate or something better, I could care less  
Just stay with me a while  
Wait, there is a light, there is a fire de-fragmenting the attic  
Fate or something better, I could care less  
Just stay with me a while  
  
I picture your face in the back of my eyes  
A fire in the attic, a proof of the prize  
Anna Molly, Anna Molly, Anna Molly  
I'll call out your name  
Up into the air  
Not one of the others  
Could ever compare  
Anna Molly, Anna Molly  
Anna Molly (wait, there is a light, there is a fire de-fragmenting the attic)  
Anna Molly (fate or something better, I could care less, just stay with me a
while)  
  
Doo, doo, doo, doo, do, do  
Doo, doo, doo, doo, do, do

Floatin' round my brain,  
Tryin' to think about the other thing.  
Than that thought you know I'm considering.  
What if what I thought,  
About who I think I though I was,  
Was nothing more than my cerebellum slobbering?  
Azwethinkweizm is hard to think about,  
But simple to trust.  
  
You'll know your on it  
When your brain won't stop to take a break, no!  
So when donut boy comes askin' around,  
Tryin' to figure out somethin' new,  
You just smile and say,  
"Pardon you! I'm sifting through  
Some particles and farcing through some folds.  
I've stumbled upon a brain fart  
Which melts away your molds!"  
  
So I think upon that ponder  
While I'm pondering the thought,  
Just thinkin' about the thinkweiz  
Is leaving me distraught!  
Well I think I thought  
I saw an Azwethinkweiz,  
Lookin' like we think we do.  
Like we think we do.  
  
Some think I'm insane,  
'Cause I think about the other thing,  
Than that one thought you call reality.  
What if what you thought,  
About who you think you thought you were,  
Was nothing more than illusion rapidly crumbling!  
Azwethinkweism should be a topic we all can trust.  
  
It's just to bad it makes your  
Head go zippity crack dang!  
So when donut boy comes sniffing around  
Trying to figure out something new,  
You just laugh and say, "Pardon you,  
I'm sifting through some particles and  
Farcing through some folds.  
  
I've stumbled upon a brain fart  
Which melts away your molds."  
So I think upon that ponder  
While I'm pondering the thought,  
Just thinking about the thinkweiz  
Is leaving me distraught.  
  
Well I think I thought I saw an Azwethinkweiz,  
Lookin' like we think we do.  
Like we think we do.  
So what if you thought about the thinkweiz  
Was nothing like you think you are?  
You'd probably more than likely be a  
Looky-loo lookin' like you think you do.  
Like you think you do.

Stones of thought the sleaper awakes  
Gone but a chioce which path will I take  
No longer my prison my key to the past  
I'll mention your sorrow now love will ever last  
Love will ever last  
Your voice on a thought now is your blood  
A chance for new life  
Now so close in your eye  
The same lies now renders my thought  
You belted me silly, now bathe in my snot!  
Stones of thought the sleaper awakes  
Gone but a chioce which path will I take  
No longer my prison my key to the past  
I'll mention your sorrow now love will ever last  
Love will ever last

Walking alone tonight  
'Cause I've only got room for two.  
Me and my burdened black heart,  
It's all we know how to do.  
  
Yet I look for a bigger bang  
Than the kind I continually see.  
Sick of all this inertia,  
Oh, won't you mend me?  
  
Lover, can you help me?  
I'm a child lost in the woods.  
A black heart pollutes me  
And I think  
  
You're a mountain that I'd like to climb,  
Not to conquer, but to share in the view.  
  
Pulled by a false inertia,  
Pushed out by circumstance.  
Pistol firing at my feet  
That's coercing me to dance.  
  
Yet I look for a bigger bang  
Than the kind I'm sorry to know.  
Here I am, first foot of the climb.  
Watch me go.  
  
Lover, can you help me?  
I'm a child lost in the woods.  
A lit path eludes me  
And I think  
  
You're a mountain that I'd like to climb,  
Not to conquer, but to share in the view.  
You're a bonfire and I'm gathered 'round you.  
Set this old black heart inertia aflame.  
Send it away  
Send it away  
Send it away  
Send it away  
Send it away  
Send it away  
Send it away  
Send it away  
  
You're a mountain that I'd like to climb,  
Not to conquer, but to share in the view.  
You're a bonfire and I'm gathered 'round you.  
Set this old black heart inertia aflame.  
  
Set it aflame, send it away  
Set it aflame, send it away  
Set it aflame, send it away  
Set it aflame, send it away  
Set it aflame, send it away  
Set it aflame, send it away

Modern world men  
Blinded by technology  
Using the Lord's words  
For their own material needs  
Stealing the goods  
From the faithful ones  
Evangelists in suits  
Dominating their thoughts  
And souls thrown in blasphemy  
They don't know about the truth  
But they try to convince you  
[CHORUS]  
I wonder how God can resist  
Using his words like this  
Speaking the holy words  
But in a different way, in terror  
They teach'em not to be saved  
But leading them to an error, leaving'em unsafe  
Malignant force are speaking  
Through the false prophets  
They don't know that an evil spirit  
Can take a preacher's soul  
[LEAD]  
[LEAD]  
A fucking organization determined to rule the world  
Preparing those for their supreme evil one  
Ask for good help, now  
Before it's too late, you all  
After they steal your soul they even take your money away  
Trying to put all other religion down  
Like if them all was in vain  
Satan is draining their souls  
And they can't feel it  
They are all blind now  
'cause they left their true religion  
Each day their legion  
Is growing more and stronger  
Pretty soon there'll be  
No one left to survive  
Innocent people looking for guidance  
They don't know who they're messing with  
[CHORUS]  
I wonder how God can resist  
Using his words like this  
Taking the Bible to make a profit  
They can't escape from the blaspheming prophets  
[LEAD]  
  
  

I don't want to talk to you anymore  
I'm afraid of what I might say  
I bite my tongue every time you come around  
Cause blood in my mouth beats blood off the ground  
  
Hand over my heart I swear,  
I've tried everything I could within all my power  
2 weeks and 1 hour  
I slaved and now I've got nothing to show  
Oh if only you've grown taller than a brick wall  
From now on  
Gonna start holding my breath  
When you  
Come around and you flex that fake grin  
Cause something inside me has said more than twice  
That breathing this air  
Beats breathing you at all  
  
I don't want to talk to you anymore  
I'm afraid of what I might say  
I bite my tongue every time you come around  
Cause blood in my mouth beats blood off the ground  
  
Hand over my mouth  
I'm earning the right to my silence  
In quiet discerning between ego and timing  
Good judgment is once again proving to me  
That its still worth its weight in gold  
From now on I'm gonna be so much more weary  
When you start to speak and my warm blood starts to boil  
Seeing you is like pulling teeth  
And hearing your voice is like chewing tin foil  
  
I don't want to talk to you anymore  
I'm afraid of what I might say  
I bite my tongue every time you come around  
Cause blood in my mouth beats blood off the ground  
  
I'm fast to a better judgment  
By saying less today  
I will gain more, gain more  
No tears to you my, my fickle friend  
You you brought the art of silent war  
  
I don't want to talk to you anymore  
I'm afraid of what I might say  
I bite my tongue every time you come around  
Cause blood in my mouth beats blood off the ground

On my way home, police car pulled me over.  
After they left, I puttered out of gas.  
Triple-A' came, but my card was expired!  
I had to walk home, and of course, it rained half the time.  
I tried to get some shut-eye, then I was abducted!  
  
They put cold things in my butt.  
They sampled a bit of my D.N.A.  
They left me on top of my sheets,  
I dreamt I went potty, then woke up drenched in me.  
This day sucked the hardest ever  
  
I woke up on the wrong side of the bed today.  
A little bit less than nothing would go my way.  
I got up to toss my soiled sheets,  
the hallway was dark and I stubbed my big toe.  
It was then that I sensed the irony (burning me),  
then I heard the voice say,  
"Come sail aboard S.S. Nepenthe!"  
  
I suppose I'm to blame for getting pulled over.  
I guess I'm the culprit for running out of gas.  
Let's assume I'm the guy who didn't pay his 'Triple-A' fee.  
In actuality, I let the zetas probe me.  
Yesterday was all my fault.  
  
I let negativity get the better of me.  
Thank goodness for the bathtubs and suds!  
They temporarily set free this quandary

You saw me lost in treading water  
I looked pathetic and as helpless as a stinger without a bee  
But underneath my presentation. Yeah  
I knew the walls were coming down  
And the stones that fell were aiming away from me  
  
Hey what would it mean to you?  
To know that it'll come back around again  
Hey whatever it means to you  
Know that everything moves in circles  
  
I saw you standing in my headlights Blink blink blink  
I thought Id run you down for the weight you left on me  
But then I pressed rewind, reversed and drove away  
And see you, disappear in my rear view  
Brought to me the word reciprocity  
  
Hey what would it mean to you?  
To know that it'll come back around again  
Hey whatever it means to you  
Know that everything moves in circles  
  
Round and round we go  
We could know when it ends so well  
We fall on and we fall off  
Existential carousel  
  
Hey what would it mean to you?  
To know that it'll come back around again  
Hey whatever it means to you  
Know that everything moves in circles  
Everything moves in circles

Sometimes, I feel the fear of uncertainty stinging clear  
And I can't help but ask myself how much I'll let the fear  
Take the wheel and steer  
  
It's driven me before  
And it seems to have a vague, haunting mass appeal  
But lately I am beginning to find  
That I should be the one behind the wheel  
  
Whatever tomorrow brings  
I'll be there with open arms and open eyes  
  
Whatever tomorrow brings  
I'll be there with open arms and open eyes  
  
So if I decide to waiver my chance  
To be one of the hive  
Will I choose water over wine  
And hold my own and drive?  
  
It's driven me before  
And it seems to be the way that everyone else gets around  
But lately I am beginning to find  
That when I drive myself my light is found  
  
So whatever tomorrow brings  
I'll be there with open arms and open eyes, yeh  
  
Whatever tomorrow brings  
I'll be there with open arms and open eyes  
  
Would you kill the Queen to crush the hive?  
Would you choose water over wine  
Hold the wheel and drive?

There's something about the look in your eyes  
Something I noticed when the light was just right  
It reminded me twice that I was alive  
And it reminded me that you're so worth the fight  
  
My biggest fear will be the rescue of me  
Strange how it turns out that way, yeah  
Could you show me dear?  
Something I'm not seeing  
Something infinitely interesting  
Could you show me dear?  
Something I'm not seeing  
Something infinitely interesting  
  
there's something about the way you move  
I see your mouth in slow motion when you sing  
Like suddenly something someone contrives  
Your movements echo that I have seen the real thing  
  
Your biggest fear will be the rescue of you  
Strange how it turns out that way, yeah  
Could you show me dear?  
Something I'm not seeing  
Something infinitely interesting  
Could you show me dear?  
Something I'm not seeing  
Something infinitely interesting

Could there be a familiar ring everytime I sing about  
Cycle the tears everything in life no doubt I, I  
Reiterate to my job is all set,  
But I'll say it again anyway,  
What you give it what you get!  
  
Look at you now, look at you now,  
you're put in your place, put in your place oh,  
all medicine, all medicine is smacked in the face,  
smacked in the face again!  
Look at you now, look at you now,

all medicine, all medicine is smacked in the face,  
smacked in the face again!  
  
Smacked in the face again.  
Smacked in the face again.  
  
So when the door comes swinging back around and the taste  
of familiar medicine is abound on your breath, breath, breath  
Please don't come crawling back to me,  
cuz you'll know what I'll say  
brother let your knees bleed PLEASE!  
  
Look at you now, look at you now,  
you're put in your place, put in your place oh,  
all medicine, all medicine is smacked in the face,

Look at you now, look at you now,

Smacked in your face again  
Smacked in your face again  
Smacked in your face again  
Smacked in your face again  
  
Look at you now, look at you now,

Oooh Oh  
Oooh Oh  

Look at you  
With all your shiny  
Toys for boys  
It's all unnerving  
  
Bold and new  
But dark and spotty  
The toys enjoy  
The undeserving  
  
Don't ask  
Don't tell  
Follow  
Don't ask  
Don't tell  
Yeah  
  
Fat the world  
Then sink your teeth in  
Cannibal and missionary  
Toes are curled  
My thanks uneven  
When tales so tall  
Are ordinary  
  
Don't ask  
Don't tell  
Follow  
Don't ask  
Don't tell  
Yeah  
  
Don't ask  
Don't tell  
Follow  
Don't ask  
Don't tell  
Yeah

Yo, it's Hanukkah time right about now [?]  
We be dreidlein'  
We bout to set it  
Baby go get your dreidle on  
Uh uh uh uh  
Get your dreidle on  
  
All of my homies in Santa Monica celebrate Hanukkah  
And my peeps in the streets are [?] for every one of those  
8 nights of lights  
And a menorah of  
Muthafuckin fantasy of fun, all rolled into one  
  
See the thing is, I'm not really Jewish  
But Mike said, Kil, won't you come down  
So I hopped up to do this  
Through this time of 8 days  
We all come together and celebrate  
We grub lots of manzos [?] and latkes, A. K. A. Potato pancakes  
  
3, 2, 1  
Hanukkah, Hanukkah, Hanukkah  
Oh, what a lotta fun  
Here I go again, once again  
No I don't mean to offend  
I grub all my gefilte fish, mmm, as quick as I can  
Then I light a candle and ouch  
Whoops, I just burned my hand  
Don't really matter though, cuz I gotta go  
And down some Manischewitz wine  
Yeah, now I'm feelin just fiiiiiine  
  
Yo, Mikey in the temple, all up on the beamer, eatin  
Challah, challah  
You know I'll be cleaner than a shiny silver platter of chocolate chip
macaroons  
My afro leavin Mike shadows as I step in the room  
  
You heard Hanukkah was comin and it's comin correct  
Lightin candles, open presents, showin family respect  
To the creator of the earth and of the fruit of the vine Manischewitz flowin
large, like it ain't got the time, yo  
  
Cuz we be eatin challah, challah  
With salt and butta  
  
That's right  
Hanukkah 2001, y'all  
We be dreidlein  
We're outta here  
Shalom for sheezy my neezy

If I had a dime for every time you walked away,  
I could afford to not give a shit  
And buy a drink and drown the day  
But your pockets, they are empty,  
Yeah, and mine are times two  
So why not make an about-face,  
And accept the love I send to you?  
  
You're never gonna be content if you font try,  
Try to see outside your line.  
There you go, you did it again!  
You act as if there's binder on your eyes.  
Should I apologize if what I say burns your ears and stains  
Your eyes?!  
  
Oh, did I crack your shell?  
When it falls away, you'll see we exist as well!  
Like a bottle with the cork stuck,  
Your true ingredients trapped inside.  
  
Through the cloudy glass we catch a glimpse of you,  
I guess the hard shell represents your pride.  
Oh, if only it could be different  
We could uncover the you, you deny.  
  
Between two, a small discrepancy,  
One complicates and one simplifies.  
Take those fucking blinders off your eyes!!  
So if I had a dime for every time you walked away,  
You could bet your bottom dollar that  
I'd be filthy rich by noon today

To get up and walk away will be too easy  
So stay and stand your ground just watch your mouth with me  
On the back of every right, there's a wrong looming  
So here you and I should tread assault  
As these razorblades for boots will it be  
  
Have you ever tried to step in my shoes?  
Have you ever tried to balance that beam?  
And if you ever try to fit in my shoes  
They'll never be quite as soft as they seem  
  
Unabashed honesty would be ideal  
But a prophet did once say, that honesty's our only word  
So where do we go from here? Abandon ship now!  
My problem is you made me melt and I don't want to be frozen anymore  
  
Have you ever tried to step in my shoes?  
Have you ever tried to balance that beam?  
And if you ever try to fit in my shoes  
They'll never be quite as soft as they seem  
  
Oh oh no oh no  
  
Have you ever, have you ever tried to, I have never, I have never tried to!  
  
Have you ever tried to step in my shoes?  
Have you ever tried to balance that beam?  
And if you ever try to fit in my shoes  
They'll never be quite as soft as they seem

This party is old and uninviting  
Participants in black and white  
You enter in full-blown technicolor  
Nothing is the same after tonight  
  
If the world would fall apart  
In a fiction-worthy wind  
I wouldn't change a thing  
Now that you're here  
  
Love is a verb  
Here in my room [Repeat: x3]  
Your love is a verb  
Here in my room [Repeat: x3]  
  
You enter and close the door behind you  
Now show me the world seen from the stars  
If only the lights would dim on winter  
I'm wary of eyes upon the skies  
  
If the world would fall apart  
In a fiction-worthy wind  
I wouldn't change a thing  
Now that you're here  
  
Love is a verb  
Here in my room [Repeat: x3]  
Your love is a verb  
Here in my room [Repeat: x3]  
  
Tractor beam into your incision  
Spinning as free ? vicious world  
I came here expecting next to nothing  
So thank you for being that kind of girl  
Kind of girl [Repeat: x10]

About a hundred years ago now,  
Thought I was left for dead.  
Soliloquy, she was my  
A picture, a wake,  
My metaphoric friend.  
  
So then I fell in love with an irony named life,  
It taught me this from that and  
A picture, a wake, you're gonna be Hilikus.  
  
History has a tendency  
To block yout the popular beliefs  
About the leaders of the time,  
So glisten with my syllables and  
Ponder the thought,  
Maybe they should have  
Had to dedicate more to it, go!  
You've got to be,  
So good to be,  
You've got to be Hilikus!  
  
So I took a walk out side  
With my new found friend and the knowledge imbibe.  
I figured I'd find another  
With the same attitude,  
Yes, then maybe I could talk  
To someone other than myself!  
  
The doors are swinging wide open,  
A positive attitude and the ilk in my pocket  
Had a lot to do with my new found friend,  
The Hilikus.  
  
History has a tendency  
To block out the popular beliefs  
About the leaders of the time,  
So glisten with my syllables and  
Ponder the thought,  
Maybe they should have had to dedicate more to it, go!  
  
You've got to be,  
So good to be,  
You've got to be

Lyrics for Hunger For Power  
Performed by Incubus  
Rational human beings irrational in other ways  
Betraying each other in an unfriendly race  
All they do is think for themselves  
Ask them for some help and they'll tell you to go to Hell  
Welcome to the brutal world  
Vehemence, the way it goes  
Rejoicing for the disgrace of the successful one  
The jealousy is the weapon of the incompetent bum  
So if you think you've got your best frined  
You better look back, you never know what he might do next  
The anger is built in silence  
It's gonna cause some ignorant violence  
That's a goal rule number one  
To achieve in command  
What they've done in the past  
You're gonna let'em pay back  
I wonder why you do to others  
What you don't want them doing to you  
If prejudice has a value in life  
Evil would rule you too  
Remember for all the bad things you commit  
You're gonna pay with the same coin, you damn fool  
Breaking the barrier between patience and rage  
That are controlling you  
Now you're feeling what your best friend was going through  
That's the way the circle of life  
Has been for many years ago people are so greedy  
When they're in trouble, they look for you  
You can't lose this society battle  
Evil plans are coming to your mind  
To fight back, a sabotage  
That has happened many times  
CHORUS  
Hunger for power  
When you die  
All you have  
Won't go with you  
Hunger for power  
Stupid fight  
You better stand straight  
Or you might fall  
CHORUS  
Hunger for power  
You'll never know  
What might happen  
To us all  
Hunger for power  
When you die  
All you have  
Won't go with you  

To see you when I wake up  
Is a gift I didn't think could be real  
  
To know that you feel the same as I do  
Is a three-fold utopian dream  
  
You do something to me that I can't explain  
So would I be out of line if I said  
I miss you?  
  
I see your picture  
I smell your skin on the empty pillow next to mine  
  
You have only been gone ten days  
But already I'm wasting away  
  
I know I'll see you again  
Whether far or soon  
  
But I need you to know that I care  
And I miss you

You keep your riches and I'll sew my stitches,  
You can't make me think like you, mundane.  
I've got a message for all those who think that  
They can etch his words inside my brain  
T.V., what do I need?  
  
Tell me who to believe!  
What's the use of autonomy  
When a button does it all?  
So listen up,  
Glisten up closely all,  
Who've seen the fuckin eye ache too.  
  
It's time to step away from cable train  
And when we finally see the subtle light,  
This quirk in evolution will begin  
To let us live and recreate  
T.V., what do I need?  
  
Tell me who to believe!  
What's the use of autonomy  
When a button does it all?  
T.V., what should I see?  
Tell me who should I be?  
Lets do our mom a favor and drop  
A new god off a wall.  
  
Let me see past the fatuous knocks.  
I've gotta rid myself of this idiot box!  
Let you see past the feathers and flocks,  
And help me plant a bomb in this idiot box!  
From the depths of the sea  
To the tops of the trees  
To the seat of a lazy boy  
Staring at a silver screen!

I have waited  
Dined on ashes  
Swung from chandeliers and climbed Everest  
And none of it's got me close to this  
  
I've waited all my life  
If not now, when will I?  
  
We've been good  
Even a blast, but  
Don't you feel like something's missing here?  
Don't you dare, ooh, ooh  
  
I've waited all my life  
If not now, when will I?  
Stand up and face the bright light  
Don't hide your eyes  
It's time, it's time, it's time  
  
No umbrellas  
No sunglasses  
Heal and hallelujah everyday  
  
I've waited all my life  
If not now, when will I?  
Stand up and face the bright light  
Don't hide your eyes  
It's time, it's time, it's time  
It's time

I was lost but now I am found  
A line was crossed, a vessel run aground  
The boy has gone, let's grieve and let him go  
He left at dawn, but it's a new day don't you know?  
  
In the company of wolves I sat in silence  
Observant and afraid  
He was there with the eyes like glowing embers  
The man you see was made, oh whoa whoa  
  
I was low but now I am high  
It helps to know serenity from ennui  
Oh oh, something's wrong, something's wrong,  
When it all remains the same  
So face the fire, come into your name  
  
In the company of wolves I sat in silence  
Observant and afraid  
He was there with the eyes like glowing embers  
The man you see was made, oh whoa ooh  
  
Even I can't recall how many days I had been out there for  
But when all those lights cease to shine,  
I was alive I think for the first time  
Infinity it falls, in feathery folds  
But she bites like loveless eyes,  
And with her belly full she called this rite of passage,  
It was the longest night of my life  
  
It was the longest night of my life  
  
Even I can't recall how many days I had been out there for  
But when all those lights cease to shine,  
I was alive I think for the first time  
Infinity it falls, in feathery folds  
But she bites like loveless eyes,  
And with her belly full she called this rite of passage,  
It was the longest night of my life  
  
It was the longest night of my life

When our powerful structure creates sound  
The walls of the hall start coming down  
You're thrashing and slamming like there's no end  
The mob starts to get out of hand  
Distorted sound goes through your ears  
The pounding of the bass creates fear  
You stop and breathe when we slow down  
You have no chance 'cause our drummer's not fucking around  
Now you're gonna have this torment  
For the rest of your life  
No peace, No chance, No sleep day or night  
We're coming through your nughtmare you will see  
So be ready to meet the power of...  
[CHORUS]  
Incubus, Incubus  
[LEAD]  
[CHORUS]  
Incubus  
You are the victim, because you betray us  
You've got no place to hide  
You can't destroy us we'll crank the decibel high  
Our sound can never die! Die! Die!  
The mission's not over  
Preparing for your destruction  
We'll thrash you with all emotion  
You're running out of time  
There's nothing you can do  
We're taking your breath from you  
Nothing you can do, Take your breath from you  
We'll smash your skull  
Came from the word  
Only one word  
Came from the sound of Incubus.  
  
  

Erica and her Isadore  
Climbed aboard a balloon  
I want more than this kite will soar  
I've set our sights on the moon  
  
You can't just leave, I've given everything  
I can't believe you're taking everything  
You're taking everything  
Oh  
  
It's not who you were  
It's who you are  
And we've come this far lover  
No, I won't rest  
Until the world  
Knows the name Isadore  
  
Blinded by their unbridled height  
Our lovers turned dissolute  
  
You can't just leave, I've given everything  
I can't believe you're taking everything  
You're taking everything  
Oh  
  
It's not who you were  
It's who you are  
And we've come this far lover  
No, I won't rest  
Until the world  
Knows the name Isadore  
Knows the name Isadore  
  
Then with eyes wide, a splintered sight  
There's just one parachute  
Goodbye Erica now I see  
That my worst fears were in tune  
  
It's not who you were  
It's who you are  
And we've come this far lover  
No, I won't rest  
Until the world  
Knows the name Isadore  
  
Knows the name Isadore  
Won't rest  
Until the world  
Knows the name Isadore

Thats it baby,thats the right tempo  
  
Some people call me the space cowboy  
Some call me the gangster of love  
Some people call me Maurice  
Cause i speak with the condements of love  
  
::chourus::  
Im a picker  
IM a grinner  
Im a lover  
And im a sinner  
I play my music in the sun  
  
Im a joker  
Im a smoker  
Ise a midnight toker  
watever  
Sure dont wanna hurt no one  
  
::chorus::

I am bottled fizzy water  
And you were shaking me up  
You are a fingernail running  
Down the chalkboard I thought I left in third grade  
Now my only consolation  
Is that this could not last forever  
Even though you're singing and thinking how well you've got it made  
  
Who are you?  
And will you be through  
Yeah, it's just a phase  
It will be over soon  
Yeah, it's just a phase  
Yeah, it's just a...phase  
  
Call it women's intuition  
But I think I'm on to something here  
Temporaryism has been the black plague  
And the Jesus of our age  
I know that I sound opinionated  
Maybe biased and quite possibly jaded  
But sooner than later they'll be throwing quarters at you on the stage  
  
Who are you?  
And will you be through  
Yeah, it's just a phase  
It will be over soon  
Yeah, it's just a phase  
Yeah, it's just a, phase  
  
And I am waiting for it to be over too

Does it make you envy?  
Does it make you proud?  
To tuck the world into a paper bag  
This body's state of "I'm OK, you're not OK"  
Yes, men, too, could be on the rag  
  
I'm over my head I need a pick-me-up  
Its easy to get high when you're standing on our backs, man  
Would anything ever be good enough for you?  
Stand on your own, hold your water if you can  
  
The ride's over, did you enjoy yourself?  
The ride's over, fair thee well  
The ride's over, did you enjoy yourself?  
The ride's over, fair thee well  
Not on my time  
  
It isn't fair to mention, but it awes the crowd  
Your fictional, plastic alibi  
So take another hit, steal another line  
Did you ever meet a leech who was good at goodbyes?  
  
When you were down I always picked you up  
Why didn't I recognize that everything was never fine?  
I'm kicking myself that I shared spit with you  
So fuck yourself  
And fuck this bleeding heart of mine  
  
The ride's over, did you enjoy yourself?  
The ride's over, fair thee well  
The ride's over, did you enjoy yourself?  
The ride's over, fair thee well  
Not on my time  
  
When you were down I always picked you up  
Why didn't I recognize that everything was never fine?  
I'm kicking myself that I shared spit with you  
So fuck yourself and fuck this bleeding heart of mine  
  
The ride's over, did you enjoy yourself?  
The ride's over, fair thee well  
The ride's over, did you enjoy yourself?  
The ride's over, fair thee well  
  
The ride's over

The hardest thing is rendering a  
Moment moving too fast to endure  
But you abide and smile wide cause  
I want to remember this for sure  
You can give me guns and politics and  
I'll just make a mess of it, you know  
Give me all the sustenance and  
The wiser wider part of me will show  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
A picture says with sight  
What we can't say with words  
But you've been walking eyes to feet  
In dark sunglasses  
A picture will survive  
So smile and look alive  
The camera lens is opening  
The wider angle's yours  
  
Yeah every empty one of us have methods  
To quell the madness of this pace  
But yours have bled and are running south  
Like jealous Dior mascara down your face  
You could take that wait and all that fuss so  
Now just get the best of us, you know  
Give me love not suicide and  
The wise wider part of me will show  
Yeah yeah  
  
A picture says with sight  
What we can't say with words  
But you've been walking eyes to feet  
In dark sunglasses  
A picture will survive  
So smile and look alive  
The camera lens is opening  
The wider angle's yours!  
  
Look alive, smile  
Smile and look alive  
Smile, smile and look alive  
Yeah whoa oh  
  
A picture says with sight  
What we can't say with words  
But you've been walking eyes to feet  
In dark sunglasses  
A picture will survive  
So smile and look alive  
  
A picture says with sight  
What we can't say with words  
But you've been walking eyes to feet  
In dark sunglasses  
A picture will survive  
So smile and look alive  
The camera lens is opening  
The wider angle's yours  
  
Look alive  
Smile, smile and look alive  
Yeah, smile and look alive  
Yeah whoa

Tonight we drink to youth  
And holding fast to truth  
Don't want to lose what I had as a boy  
  
My heart still has a beat  
But love is now a feat  
As common as a cold day in LA  
Sometimes at night alone I wonder  
Is there a spell that I am under  
Keeping me from seeing the real thing  
  
Love hurts  
But sometimes it's a good hurt  
And it feels like I'm alive  
  
Love sings  
When it transcends the bad things  
Have a heart and try me  
'Cause without love I won't survive  
  
I'm fettered and abused  
Stand naked and accused  
Should I surface this one man submarine  
  
I only want the truth  
So tonight we drink to youth  
I'll never lose what I had as a boy  
Sometimes at night alone I wonder  
Is there a spell that I am under  
Keeping me from seeing the real thing  
  
Love hurts  
But sometimes it's a good hurt  
And it feels like I'm alive  
  
Love sings  
When it transcends the bad things  
Have a heart and try me  
'Cause without love I won't survive  
  
Without love I won't survive  
  
Love hurts  
But sometimes it's a good hurt  
And it feels like I'm alive  
  
Love sings  
When it transcends the bad things  
Have a heart and try me  
'Cause without love I won't survive  
  
Love hurts, oh  
Love hurts  
Without love I won't survive  
  
Love hurts, oh  
Love hurts  
Without love I won't survive

I heard a word from on high  
Glare like a light in the sky it said  
"quit blowing each other up"  
A voicing so crystalline clear so  
Somethings unclear in your ear  
When only blood will fill your cup  
  
Hello I'm trying to focus  
But my eyes deceive me  
Focus I'm witnessing history, repeating  
  
It fell like a tear from my eye  
Flying machine so up high well,  
There goes the neighborgood  
A scene set to singe innocence  
Up heave unhinge and pit against  
Like every made for TV should  
  
Hello I'm trying to focus  
But my eyes deceive me  
Focus I'm witnessing history, repeating  
  
Focus  
  
We are  
We know  
We see  
We think  
For you  
  
The who  
The what  
The when  
The where  
The why  
  
We build your young  
We built you too  
Wee see you all  
  
Hello I'm trying to focus  
But my eyes deceive me  
Focus I'm witnessing history, repeating

I'm at the end of my report again  
For those who won't do apathy  
You had the perfect opportunity  
But pled the fifth and walked away  
  
Say something  
Make us proud  
Cast the first stone  
Say anything at all  
  
Make a move  
For every one thing we're ignorant of  
A thousand more things beat the maze  
You saw the apple hanging on the tree  
But missed the orchard in your gaze  
  
Say something  
Make us proud  
Cast the first stone  
Say anything at all  
  
Make a move  
(hands on the eyes are the engines of demise)  
Make a move  
  
I'm cautious of who I would call a friend  
Who you aquaint is who you are  
The darkest hours are when we choose a side  
So make your pick and take a fall  
  
Say something  
Say anything at all  
Make a move  
(hands on the eyes are the engines of demise)  
Make a move  

She was a new mean beauty queen  
Money, drugs, magazines  
That didn't do nothin'  
That didn't do nothin'  
They gave her diamonds  
Shiny boys, city speak, every toy  
That didn't do nothin'  
No nothin' for her  
You can  
Lead a horse to water  
But you can't expect it to drink  
Now ain't that somethin'  
Now ain't that somethin'  
Yea when the world is  
At you're gate that won't satiate  
Why are you crying  
If you work for nothing at all?  
  
Don't be a fly in my martini baby  
Come on down  
That roof is high and I'm not climbing  
Tonight, come down and I'll give you  
Something, hey! to cry about  
  
Fast cars, blue jean bars  
Trial and drowning scars  
It wont do nothing, it wont do nothing  
Even the best frame wont change  
Your wet painting into the Mona Lisa, the Mona Lisa  
You've got to dry your eyes baby, i know that your body will  
Cry if you want to, cry if you want to  
If the world is at your gate and that don't fill your plate  
Why are you cryin'  
If you work for nothing at all?  
  
Mmmmm  
  
Don't be a fly in my martini baby  
Come on down  
That roof is high and I'm not climbing  
Tonight, come down and I'll give you  
Something, hey! to cry about  
  
A fly in my martini baby  
Come on down  
That roof is high and I'm not climbing  
Tonight, come down and I'll give you  
Something, hey! to cry about  
  
A fly in my martini baby  
Come on down  
That roof is high and I'm not climbing  
Tonight, come down and I'll give you  
Something, hey! to cry about  
  
A fly in my martini baby  
Come on down  
That roof is high and I'm not climbing  
Tonight, come down and I'll give you  
Something, hey! to cry about

No survive  
Unborn child  
Cut to piece  
Left without a name  
Unwanted because of the problem of humanity  
Unspeakable crime  
Silent war is the name of the game  
Millions are dying in actions of death and pain  
Misguided mothers make this happen  
Sometimes for a financial situation  
Or a sexual mistake  
CHORUS  
Massacre of the unborn  
Massacre of the unborn  
Massacre of the unborn child  
Innocent blood cries in vain  
Defenseless lives are slaughtered everyday  
They should make a law against this insanity  
Unborn corpses are growing in extreme quantity  
Premature stage  
Slowly destroyed by the human race  
Tortured by tyrants  
Unjustly demise  
Infant children  
Are left to die  
Just innocence lives they slay  
There is no chance to escape  
Murdering in the matter of this case  
A merciless torture to take  
No one will live, because they won't survive  
There's infants dying  
Can't you see  
That they will not have a chance  
Of growing up in this life  
CHORUS  
Massacre of the unborn  
Massacre of the unborn  
Massacre of the unborn child  

Medium, medium.  
  
Waking up I smell the scent of coffee on the brew,  
And I think about the amount of the sweet,  
I'd like to have in my cup today.  
One for the two lump, three lump, four.  
No half of one, no less no more.  
  
Just give me a chance, let me make it mine.  
I'd like a medium blend of that piece of pie.  
Not too bitter, not too sweet  
Medium.  
Just enough to ?  
Medium.  
Not too bitter, not too sweet  
Medium.  
Just enough to ?  
Medium.  
  
Dinner time just rolls around,  
And I think I crave a steak but,  
I'm not too partial to the meat,  
When it's cooked too long and I'm made to wait.  
  
Not too much of the parsony,  
And just enough of the spice.  
I think I'd enjoy a medium-rare dish with a side of fries.  
Not too tender, not too tough  
Medium.  
Not too little, just enough  
Medium.  
Not too tender, not too tough  
Medium.  
Not too little, just enough  
Medium.  
Medium. Medium. Medium. Medium. Just a medium. Medium.  
  
? and I smell the pits but ?  
I could've sworn a ? last week and scrubbed like ?  
I like to stink just a little bit,  
Just to keep you on your toes yes.  
The more I stink the more I think,  
That you smell like a rose.  
  
Not too pleasant, not too bad  
Medium.  
Just enough to hold my ?  
Medium.  
Not too pleasant, not too bad  
Medium.  
Just enough to hold my ?  
Medium.

I hear you on the radio  
You permeate my screen, its' unkind but  
If I met you in a scissor fight  
I'd cut off both your wings on principle alone  
On principle alone  
  
Hey megalomaniac  
You're no Jesus  
Yeah, you're no fucking Elvis  
Special, as you know yourself  
Baby, just step down, step down  
  
If I were your appendages  
I'd hold open your eyes  
So you would see  
That all of us are heaven sent  
There was never meant to be only one  
To be only one  
  
Hey megalomaniac  
You're no Jesus  
Yeah, you're no fucking Elvis  
Special, as you know yourself  
Baby, just step down, step down  
  
Yeah  
You're no Jesus  
You're no Elvis  
You're no answer  
  
Hey megalomaniac  
You're no Jesus  
Yeah, you're no fucking Elvis  
Special, as you know yourself  
Just step down

You could see me reaching,  
So why couldnt you have met me halfway  
You could see me bleeding  
But you could not put pressure on the wound  
  
You only think about yourself.  
You only think about yourself.  
You'd better bend before I go  
On the first train to Mexico  
  
You could see me breathing  
But you still kept your hand over my mouth  
You could feel me seething  
But you just turned your nose up in the air  
  
You only think about yourself.  
You only think about yourself  
You'd better bend before I go  
On the first train to Mexico  
  
You only think about yourself.  
You only think about yourself  
You'd better bend before I go  
On the first train to Mexico

A midnight swim  
Is what I'm needing  
A careless whim  
A fast for feeding  
  
I take to the deep  
Where the lights been til now  
Gotta break out and find  
What the day left behind  
  
So into blue  
Begin an ark  
The man was you  
True and spark oh  
  
I take to the deep  
Where the lights been til now, safe  
Gotta break and out and find  
What the day left behind  
  
Now  
No no no  
Whoa no no no  
Whoa no no no  
Whoa ah  
  
Water and salt  
Secrets like new  
Arrive salt  
A midnight swim  
  
I take to the deep  
Where the lights, until now, asleep  
Gotta break in and find  
What the day left behind  
  
No  
No no no  
Whoa  
No no no  
Whoa  
No no  
Whoa  
Aha

Do you enjoy your sight inside?  
  
Disconnect and let me drift,  
Until my upside down is right side in.  
Society must let the artist go,  
To wander off into the nebula.  
  
[Chorus]  
Wander off into your nebula, see your nectarine of multiplicity  
Cum like orgasmatron on overdrive!  
Wander in off to your nebula,  
Your tangerine of electricity is ripe and on a vine,  
So pick your prize!  
  
In little, black book do I confide.  
  
Upon return, I conjure what was seen.  
I let it pulse and boil within my limbs.  
I lay my pencil to the porous page,  
And let my lunatic indulge itself.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Disconnect and let me drift,  
Until my upside down is right side in.  
Society must let the artist go,  
To wander off into the nebula.

Viewed the scene on a black and white T. V.  
Choose your words "hey mom I want to be..."  
So, study hard.  
Your work became your cell.  
Don't you dare inhale, or you'll be damned to hell!  
No! Yes, back and in your prime and things are in a swirl.  
Solaced with your choice, out pops a baby girl!  
Family now complete, and power's in your hands.  
You've won the greatest prize, it's time to take a stand.  
Sphincter freed last on your common throne.  
You think the kill weeds chompin' at your noodles flow.  
There's somethin about the herb, so fast, hypnotize.  
A ripened head change that'll pillow your eyes.  
Will you be the superman inflicting drastic change?  
The power of your name has spanded out a boundless range.  
Will you meet the needs of a fast paced, awkward,  
Life-span I call "we"?  
Our trust is now within you.  
So by soul cries let it be.  
Pillow your eyes!  
Yes, I, praise Jah

Isn't it strange that a gift could be an enemy?  
Isn't it weird that a privilege could feel like a chore?  
Maybe it's me but this line isn't going anywhere  
Maybe if we looked hard enough, we could find a backdoor  
(Find yourself a backdoor)  
  
I see you in line, dragging your feet  
You have my sympathy  
The day you were born, you were born free  
That is your privilege  
  
Isn't it strange that the man standing in front of me  
Doesn't have a clue why he is waiting, or what he's waiting for?  
Maybe it's me, but I'm sick of wasting energy  
Maybe if I look in my heart I could find a backdoor  
(Find yourself a backdoor)  
  
I see you in line, dragging your feet  
You have my sympathy  
The day you were born, you were born free  
That is your privilege

The human race started with Adam and Eve  
They lived in a world where they were free  
So listen and beware that this is Hell  
'cause they ate the fruit from the tree  
[CHORUS]  
Mighty force  
Evil's mighty force  
When Satan took a Serpent form  
The couple's destiny was then traced  
Leaving God's wrath frustrated  
They couldn't resist the Serpent Temptation  
[CHORUS]  
Mighty force  
Evil's mighty force  
Mighty force  
Evil's mighty force  
We now live in a world of civilization  
We're still affected by the Serpent Temptation  
Technology won't help you to get salvation  
The devil doomed God's creation  
So let's destroy the devil's fucking nation  
[LEAD]  
  
  

No your not the first to fall apart  
But always the first one to complain  
You better get careful or you'll compromise  
Everything you are  
  
The world is a drought when out of love  
Please come back to us you're all of the above  
"I'm making a choice to be out of touch  
Leave me be" he said  
He said he said  
"leave me here in my  
Stark raving sick sad little world!"  
  
I've never had unpaid confidants  
Its more than I would care to explain  
But I have an open door policy when it comes to blame  
  
The world is a joke when out of love  
Please come back to us your all of the above  
"I'm making a choice to be out of touch  
Leave me be" he said  
He said he said  
"leave me here in my  
Stark raving sick sad little world!"

Solstice sun it sank beneath the line  
And the commoners were  
  
Drunken upon the hillside  
Or so the story goes.  
I guess she followed along  
So she could  
  
Watch their games!  
Sink beneath the line little girl.  
Peak above the shrine them commoners were.  
Harvest moon it peaked above the shrine  
And the crawlers emerged multitudious!  
Silly girl she sat upon their doorway  
Just poppin a squat!  
That's when she  
  
Felt the squirms.  
My underpants!  
All I know is that she wanted to be part of the crowd.  
I could've told her she was welcome here, anywhere!  
  
But instead she combed the outskirts lookin inside  
And then she sat upon a bughill.  
This was when things started to get rough.  
  
An army-o-de-pinchers climbed their creepy ways  
Right inside her 5-0-1 cut-offs  
And her skin took on a hue of a chemical unknown to me that's right!  
They were biting her beneath the line.  
  
She was a sitting on atop their shrine.  
I wish I could've warned her!  
"She should've worn underpants!  
There's bugs crawling everywhere and shit,  
I can't believe it!"

Met my match today  
Felt the blood rushing and mingling  
A curious and enigmatic thing now  
Spiders in my dreams  
Synchronicity weaves like a web when  
You were meant to be a meal  
  
I want you so bad  
I want you so bad  
I understand why they say  
High school never ends  
  
Ill never act my age  
But you can tell byu the lines in my smile  
That I have been around for a while  
So insecurities  
Are about as useful as trying  
To put the pin back in the grenade  
  
I want you so bad  
I want you so bad  
I understand why they say  
High school never ends  
  
This isn't coincidence  
There's no such thing  
This isn't coincidence  
There's no such thing  
No such thing

Is everything a baited hook?  
And are there locks on all doors?  
If you're looking for an open book  
Look no further  
I am yours  
  
We'll behave like animals  
Swing from tree to tree  
We could do anything that turns you up and sets you free  
  
You're an exception to the rule  
You're a bonafide rarity  
You're all I ever wanted  
Southern girl, could you want me?  
  
Come outside and walk with me  
We'll try each other on to see if we fit  
And with our roots become a tree  
To shade what we make under it.  
  
We'll behave like animals  
Swing from tree to tree

Southern girl

Meet me in outer space  
We could spend the night  
Watch the earth come up  
I've grown tired of that place  
Won't you come with me?  
We could start again  
  
How do you do it?  
Make me feel like I do  
How do you do it?  
It's better than I ever knew  
  
Meet me in outer space  
I will hold you close  
If you're afraid of heights  
I need you to see this place  
It might be the only way  
That I can show you how it feels to be inside of you  
  
How do you do it?  
Make me feel like I do  
How do you do it  
It's better than I ever knew  
You are stellar

I keep getting attacked by  
The girl in the black hat  
The girl in the black hat.  
  
I can't find any shade but  
I'll be swayed as long as  
I got a switchblade.  
  
I keep getting the eye from  
The girl in the thigh highs  
The girl in the thing highs.  
  
With irises of jade are built  
To persuade and they're  
Swift like a switchblade.  
  
Switchblade, switchblade  
They're swift like a switchblade  
Switchblade  
  
Nobody wears it like you anymore  
Nobody wears it like you anymore  
  
Light like a feather  
Bright like a dying star.  
Cut those together  
Girl that is what you are.  
Wild eyes forever  
Built to punish and persuade.  
I like together  
But all I got was a switchblade.  
Switchblade  
  
So just gimme the facts  
Who's the girl in the black hat  
The girl in the black hat.  
  
I can't find any shade but  
I'll be swayed as long as  
I've got a switchblade.  
  
I think I'm getting a rise  
On all her American thighs  
Her American thighs.  
  
She got her black hat  
And irises of jade  
And I got a switchblade.  
Switchblade  
Yes I've got a switchblade  
  
Nobody wears it like you anymore

Ho  
  
Your foundation  
Is canyoning  
Fault lines should be worn with pride  
I hate to say it  
Your so much more  
Your so much more  
Endearing with  
The sound turned off

Roaming souls  
Prisoners of the bottomless pit  
Tempting us  
To be tortured in the everlasting fire  
They are trying  
To penetrate into your...  
Religious ones  
Protected by the words of Christ  
Militant atheists  
Destroying the ones that are unsafe  
With evil powers  
They are pestilenting  
The human race  
They are trying  
To penetrate  
Into your faith  
CHORUS  
Spirits of damnation  
Who wander throughout the world  
Trying to destroy us before Armageddon  
For the ruin of our souls  
Beware the Anti-christ will be here  
To exterminate our religion each year  
Because he knows the Son of Man is near  
Don?t be afraid Jesus Christ will be here  
The end is near  
Let?s all beware  
Of the prophecies  
Deads and alives shall be judged  
By all holy forces  
Sinners will be Satan?s wrath  
For a thousand years they will regret  
It?s coming so let?s all be aware  
They?re trying  
To penetrate  
Into your faith  
CHORUS  
Spirits of damnation  
Who wander throughout the world  
Trying to destroy us before Armageddon  
For the ruin of our souls  

Bowing down to an angle cast out by God  
Worshipping a deceitful enemy  
Who's laughing at their pride in following him  
Considering everyone to be merely human pigs  
Under his cunning and evil eyes  
CHORUS  
A multitude is in total chaos  
Knowing not the deceived ones that they are  
Asking for power, richness and desire  
The price that they must pay  
Is their souls thrown into a cauldron of fire  
By being weak and blind  
The fools disrespect the Christian houses of God  
They are the opposite of all that is Holy  
Locked in cages of sins  
How can they reject the creator of all living things  
The almighty God hears the prayers from Holy priests  
And Christians alike, forgiveness for them in at hand  
But curses shall fall upon those that refuse to repent  
God's only begotten son was scoured, mocked and put  
To death and resurrected on the third day  
Proved his powers to demonstrative  
How goodness always prevails  
Followers of damnation march on in their darkest ways  
Failing to see and admit the truth that Christ left for  
Us today  
CHORUS  
A multitude is in total chaos  
Knowing not the deceived ones that they are

I only go where I'm wanted  
You go only where you want  
I aim to be more like you  
There is a ghost in my house  
Rattling handles on every door  
Show us an open window or two  
Would you? Oh woah  
  
Doors are starting to close  
And you drew a rose my, my  
Your mind it is original, oh oh oh oh oh oh  
You're skeleton key, opening me,  
My, my your mind it is original  
Girl you're the original  
Always were and always will be  
  
The flowers of adaptation  
Unfold and lovingly alarm  
You effortlessly ring that bell  
Your stripes are yours and yours only  
The bow ideal of rare birds  
And now I am under your spell  
Oh woah, under your spell  
  
Doors are starting to close  
And you drew a rose my, my  
Your mind it is original, oh oh oh oh oh oh  
You're skeleton key, opening me,  
My, my your mind it is original  
Girl you're the original  
  
[Repeat: x5]  
Always were  
  
And will be  
  
Doors are starting to close  
And you drew a rose my, my  
Your mind it is original, oh oh oh oh oh oh  
You're skeleton key, opening me,  
My, my your mind it is original  
Girl the original  
Always were, always will be

You're happy all the time  
I just don't understand why I can't be happy too  
Your smiles are salt in the wound  
A slap upon a back that's been toiling in the sun  
  
When will I get mine?  
Or must I be a God-fearing, white American?  
Oh everything is fine  
As long as you're a God-fearing, white American  
  
Why should the thieves have all of the fun?  
Selling us water by the river, they don't speak for everyone  
I'm ready to run and you're making me crawl  
Selling me water by the river, they don't speak for me at all  
  
The man about the town  
The beauty queen, the paragon of civilization  
But shadows cling to us all  
Even those convinced that they're sheltered and immune  
  
Oh when will I get mine?  
Or must I be a God-fearing, white American?  
Yeah  
  
Why should the thieves have all of the fun?  
Selling us water by the river, they don't speak for everyone  
I'm ready to run and you're making me crawl  
Selling me water by the river, they don't speak for me at all  
They don't speak for me at all  
  
Why should the thieves have all of the fun?  
Selling us water by the river, they don't speak for everyone  
I'm ready to run and you're making me crawl  
Selling me water by the river, they don't speak for me at all  
  
I'm ready to run and you're making me crawl  
Selling me water by the river, they don't speak for me at all  
They don't speak for me at all  
They don't speak for me at all

I know you vie for the good ol' days  
And with less of us around, we were a cinch to sway  
Does it feel like it's the end of the world  
Well maybe it is, but when was it not,  
'Cause it's true, me and you  
We are all tomorrow's food today  
  
There's no such thing as the good ol' days  
The older we all get, the better we all were  
There's no such thing as the end of the world  
(But just in case!) you'd best batten down and button up  
Because it's true, me and you  
We are all tomorrow's food today

The evening began as a positive swaret  
And my abode was 4-2-0 G.  
But little did I know that in the very next apartment  
There'd be trouble on the brew for me!  
Ubiquitous I wish I could be  
Because the clock cuts short my own day!  
  
One hundred things to do before I rest my sore ass  
Upon the cushion that supports my array!  
Can this be?  
Trouble!  
So if I may, slip you a tip.  
You'd best stay away from 4-2-1.  
Trouble!  
  
So get high the green way.  
So get by the green way, yes!  
I knocked upon their door  
In hopes of bidding them their welcome  
And instead I was caught by an eye.  
His pupil was wide open  
  
Kinda like a liquor barn at 3:00.  
It was indoubadoubly dose derived.  
It was then that they took me  
And shined their light between my eyes.  
  
He said "What are ya new?  
Why are you here? What's the catch?  
Why not explain in clear? Why you're peaking around?"  
I wish I could've just kept to my own.  
  
My hospitality has been too well spent and I've paid my rent!  
I should've kept my thoughts, on who might've been inside  
So that my mind could sit and delude my pride!  
I beg my common sense to keep my  
Neighbor out away from my front door  
  
Until I find a way  
To hide myself from those in 4-2-1, one  
..one away from the good one.

Your heart burns for love  
My soul burns for blood  
I'll take you, I'll brake you  
I'll crush you, I'll brake you  
If you want me, I'll need you  
I'll kill you, feed from you  
I'll take you down that road that leads to destruction  
  
Ref.  
Come and take a walk with me  
Where the angels fear to tread  
Kiss the flame  
Feel the pain  
In the furnace of our love  
  
I can't feed my hunger  
Your youth makes me younger  
I'll hurt you, desert you  
Turn your dreams to nightmares  
I'll cheat you, I'll eat you  
I'll maim you, I'll drain you  
Come to me, come to me  
To the dark side where love sleeps  
  
Ref.  
Come and take a walk with me  
Where the angels fear to tread  
Kiss the flame  
Feel the pain  
In the furnace of our love  
Come along and talk to me  
Sing a sweet song of despair  
In your body hear the song  
In the furnace of our love  
  
I'll hurt you, you love me  
I'll scratch you, I'll cut you  
You'll kiss me, then miss me  
I laugh at your torment  
I'll have you, and own you  
Be hard and cold to you  
I'll be your dark angel  
I'll be your worst nightmare  
  
Ref.  
Come and take a walk with me  
Where the angels fear to tread  
Kiss the flame  
Feel the pain  
In the furnace of our love  
Come along and talk to me  
Sing a sweet song of despair  
In your body hear the song  
In the furnace of our love

I'm born  
I'm alive  
I breathe  
In a moment or two I realize,  
That the sphere upon which I reside,  
Is asleep on its feet.  
Should I go back to sleep?  
We orbit the sun  
I grow up  
My open eyes see  
  
A zombified, somnambulist society.  
Leaving us as vitamins  
For the hibernating human animal.  
Do you see what I mean?  
You stare at me like a vitamin  
On the surface you hate,  
But you know you need me.  
  
I'll come dressed as any pill you deem fit.  
Whatever helps you swallow truth  
All the more easily.  
  
And I wonder, will you digest me?  
Into the sleep machine I won't plug in,  
In fact I'd rather die before I will comply.  
To you, my friend,  
I write the reason I still live,  
'cause in my mind it's set the vitamin is ripe to give  
Coming closer to another 2000 years  
You and I will pry  
The closed eye of the sleep machine

Mesmerizing sounds I hear telling me to kill  
Telling me submit to the power  
Demonic overtones I fear stealing my freewill  
I am now the man of the hour  
Controlling all my thoughts now I don?t know  
Right from wrong there is no hope for escape  
Stung by wicked words as the silence  
Speaks to me there is no hope for escape  
CHORUS  
Voices from the grave  
Telling me to sin  
My soul is what they crave  
Killing me within  
Disembodied spirits near pervading through my soul  
Getting harder to live in this Hell  
Angry voices loud and clear now they take control  
Now they leave me just an empty shell  
Controlling all my thoughts now I don?t know  
Right from wrong there is no hope for escape  
Stung by wicked words as the silence  
Speaks to me there is no hope for escape  
CHORUS  
Voices from the grave  
Telling me to sin  
My soul is what they crave  
Killing me within  
LEAD  
Nothing to do but heed to their world  
And live to their every command  
All of my thoughts are sacrificial  
And used for their violent plans  
Mustering strength to fight the attack  
Released from a hypnotic state  
I drop to my knees and pray to the Lord  
To save me from my evil fate  
Screaming in pain I?m thrown to the floor  
And grabbed by their arms of control  
The powers of evil the powers of good  
Are fighting for my weakened soul  
LEAD  
A winner emerges darkness prevails  
No future?s in sight for me  
Can?t take the pain darkness delivers  
Dying will set me free  
Clenching the gun sweating in fear  
Knowing the end is surely near  
Pulling the trigger launching death  
Evil inside me gasping breath  
Lifeless pile dead and gone  
Evil around me still lives on  
Lesson in life the road is paved  
Follow God and you?ll be saved  
Beware of voices from the grave  

Bat your eyes girl.  
Be otherworldly.  
Count your blessings.  
Seduce a stranger.  
What's so wrong with being happy?  
Kudos to those who see through sickness yeah  
  
Over and over and over and over  
  
She woke in the morning.  
She knew that her life had passed her by  
She called out a warning.  
Don't ever let life pass you by.  
  
I suggest we  
Learn to love ourselves,  
Before its made illegal  
When will we learn, When will we change  
Just in time to see it all come down  
  
Those left standing will make millions  
Writing books on ways it should have been  
  
She woke in the morning.  
She knew that her life had passed her by  
She called out a warning.  
Don't ever let life pass you by.  
  
Floating in this cosmic Jacuzzi  
We are like frogs oblivious  
To the water starting to boil,  
No one flinches and we all float face down  
  
She woke in the morning.  
She knew that her life had passed her by  
She called out a warning.  
Don't ever let life pass you by.  
Pass you by.

It's comin' around again  
They're letting it out again, again  
It's comin' around again  
They're letting it out again, again  
When it comes  
It comes abrupt  
  
When it feels, it feels like trading brains with an imbecil, for real  
Yes I feel empathetic about not being static  
And not buying philosophies that are sold to me at a steal  
  
Just when you thought it was safe to think  
In comes mental piracy  
What I'm looking for cannot be sold to me  
I wish they all would stop trying  
?Cause what I want and what I need  
Is and always will be free  
  
It's comin' around again  
They're letting it out again, again  
It's comin' around again  
When it comes  
It comes unannounced  
  
And it feels like a matador is taunting me  
With his reddest red cloth and I am the bull  
Yes I feel empathetic about not being static  
And not eating the bullshit that's being fed to me no more  
?Cause now I'm full  
  
Just when you thought it was safe to think  
In comes mental piracy  
What I ?m looking for cannot be sold to me  
I wish they all would stop trying  
?Cause what I want and what I need  
Is and will always be free  

The future is on fire  
Of a dying breed.  
Don't understate our relevance,  
We're the eyes and the walls  
And we witness the vultures feed.  
  
Yeah!  
  
[Chorus]  
(Oh)  
Stay wide awake.  
Stay wide awake.Yeah!  
(Oh)  
Make haste 'cause predators precede.  
(Oh)  
Stay wide awake.  
Stay wide awake.Yeah!  
(Oh)  
While all the vultures feed.  
  
Like angles in a sphere,  
Of our own design.  
No more perpetual innocence.  
With words we make shapes,  
And our angles can align.  
  
Yeah  
  
And our appetite's careless and menacing.  
It humbles me  
We breathe softly out with the predator?  
Such is a sight to see.  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Stay wide awake  
  
[Repeat: x4]  
While all the vultures feed

I dig my toes into the sand  
The Ocean looks like a thousand diamonds  
Strewn across a blue blanket  
I lean against the wind  
Pretend that I am weightless  
And in this moment I am happy happy)  
  
I wish you were here  
I wish you were here  
I wish you were here  
I wish you were here  
  
I lay my head onto the sand  
The sky resembles a backlit canopy  
With holes punched in it  
I'm counting UFOs  
I signal them with my lighter  
And in this moment I am happy happy)  
  
I wish you were here  
I wish you were here  
I wish you were here  
Wish you were here  
  
The worlds a roller coaster  
And I am not strapped in  
Maybe I should hold with care  
But my hands are busy in the air saying)  
  
I wish you were here  
I wish you were.  
  
I wish you were here  
I wish you were here  
I wish you were here  
Wish you were here.

Nice car where'd ya get your ride  
A trophy? badge of honor? over compensation?  
Price tags! advertise yer pride  
Since when did what we paid for colored cloth  
Gage our gravity?  
  
You should be careful what you wish for  
Cause everyone of us has the devil inside  
You should be careful what you wish for  
Cause all of what amounts becomes you  
  
Nice watch man d'ya got the time  
There's never enough and it always goes too slow  
  
You should be careful what you wish for  
Cause everyone of us has the devil inside  
You should be careful what you wish for  
Cause all of what amounts becomes you  
  
Yeah you got'cha little world  
Picture perfect its a pearl  
Now go and try to sleep  
In the bed you made
