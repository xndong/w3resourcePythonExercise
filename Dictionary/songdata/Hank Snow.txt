A good gal is hard to find  
You always get the other kind  
And when you think you've got the best in the land  
You look around and see her flirtin' with some other man  
And then you rave and then you crave  
To see her lyin' in her grave  
So guys be wise, take my good advice  
Hug her every mornin', kiss her every night  
Give her lots of lovin', man, and treat her right  
'Cause a good girl, nowadays, is hard to find

If heartaches brought fame  
In love's crazy game  
I'd be a legend in my time  
  
If they gave gold statuettes  
For tears and regrets  
I'd be a legend in my time  
  
But they don't give awards  
And there's no praise or fame  
For a heart that's been broken  
Over love that's in vain  
  
If loneliness meant world acclaim  
Everyone would know my name  
I'd be a legend in my time  
  
But they don't give awards  
And there's no praise or fame  
For a heart that's been broken  
Over love that's in vain  
  
If loneliness meant world acclaim  
Then everyone would know my name  
I'd be a legend in my time  
I'd be a legend in my time

Dear Santa Claus, It's been so long  
So long since I have written  
Since as a kid in happy house I dwelled  
I've moved from there and now I live  
On disillusion avenue  
And I've been here longer than I care to tell  
  
The twinkling bells of hope and joy  
The laughter that rang in my voice  
Have silenced more and more as time goes by  
Those treasured gifts from other years  
Are tarnished, lost or stained with tears  
So Santa would you bring a new supply  
  
I'll be hanging up my empty heart this Christmas  
Please fill it full with love and hope and cheer  
My faith is gone, my courage low, my patience ran out long ago  
Dear Santa Claus I need so much this year  
  
Bring a basket of forgetfulness to cover up the bitterness  
And the grudges that I've gathered through the years  
And leave a large bag of forgiveness  
To give out to those who robbed me  
Of my laughter that sometimes filled my eyes with tears  
And Santa please a box piled high with love and understanding  
That I could share with all my neighbors and my friends  
And leave one new temper cause I lost mine  
Lost it one too many times  
And make the new one longer if you can  
  
I'll be hanging up my empty heart this Christmas  
Please fill it full with love and hope and cheer  
Tuck in some smiles to give away and some to wear for every day  
Dear Santa Claus I need so much this year  
  
Please Santa fill my empty heart this year

Here's a rose from my garden  
Where the bloom of romance grows  
But I'll keep on a part near my aching heart  
Just a petal from a faded rose  
Love'd be sweet in the morning  
When the breeze of summer blows  
But will fade and die when the wind is nigh  
Like a petal from a faded rose  
  
Now our love is a memory  
Where it's gone nobody knows  
But I'll hold so dear as a souvenir  
Just a petal from a faded rose  
(I will live with the roses Where the sea of memory flows)  
And each time I dream then a tear will gleam  
On this petal from a faded rose

Have you found, since you've turned me down,  
The one that you were searching for?  
Are you glad that you made me sad,  
For you know I vowed to love you ever more.  
  
What did you have in mind,  
When you broke this heart of mine?  
Are you laughing in my face?  
Darlin', what can I do,  
When you tell me we are through?  
You've left a wound, time can't erase.  
  
Tell me, dear, are you satisfied,  
To be footloose and fancy free?  
Is it power you want,  
Or the things you have done?  
What you've gained, I guess I'll never see.  
  
What did you have in mind,  
When you broke this heart of mine?  
Are you laughing in my face?  
Darlin', what can I do,  
When you tell me we are through?  
You've left a wound, time can't erase.

I waited each day for your letter although I knew what it would cost  
But dear when it came I knew that your game had been won  
And I knew that I had lost  
But I just couldn't open your letter I know you're no longer my own  
The moment it came I wrote beneath my name  
These heartbreaking words address unknown  
  
I wanted to open your letter to see if you missed me sometimes  
But you have a way of making me pay cause I know what you write between the
lines  
You know I'd be so glad to see you in spite of the hurt you have done  
But deep down inside I can't lose my pride  
And forgive you just because you're the one  
So I just couldn't open your letter

Another cryin' night will soon be over now  
The morning light won't help, I'll still be blue  
'Cause everywhere I turn there's only loneliness  
Memories are all I can hold to  
  
Memories are the moments when we were as one  
Memories you would only hope to find  
Memories, in your loving arms, you'd whisper my name  
Then I would feel your burning limbs on mine  
  
All these memories are locked within my heart  
My world was gone the moment I lost you  
If wants could talk, they'd tell you of the tears I've cried  
But memories are all I can hold to  
  
Memories are the moments when we were as one  
Memories you would only hope to find  
Memories, in your loving arms, you'd whisper my name  
Then I would feel your burning limbs on mine  
Then I would feel your burning limbs on mine

Written and recorded by Hank Snow  
(spoken)  
Well howdy boys, howdy, man, man it sure seems like a long time  
Since I last rode down this old trail. How ya all anyhow?  
Fellas, you see, I still have this old cigar box with me. Yes Sir!  
And better yet, all the boys out here at the R.K. Ranch are singin'  
A new song now. Hope you like it because it's my answer to  
The Blue Velvet Band. It goes like this.  
By and old willow tree in the churchyard  
On the banks of the old Rio Grande  
Lies a loved one who died broken hearted  
She was known as the Blue Velvet Band  
She was called by the angels up yonder  
As the dew kissed the pale summer rose  
As we stood there in silence, dishearted  
These words to her lover did go  
Dear Jack, you mistrusted your darling  
You said that my love wasn't true  
You've roamed o'er the wide open spaces  
But my thoughts, they were always of you  
Now, my last wish was once more to see you  
But they say you're in some foreign land  
You're forgiveness is in this last message  
From your heartbroken Blue Velvet Band  
Far away o'er the lone western prairie  
Her message sped fast o'er the way  
To the side of a bed where her cowboy  
Was grieving his life fast away  
Please grant a last wish, boys, and lay me  
Out West on that old Rio Grande  
Neath that old willow tree in the churchyard  
By my sweetheart, the Blue Velvet Band  
  

I talked with a stranger so sad and forlorn  
His garments were sack cloth all tattered and town  
He told me a story of sorrow and woe  
His heart went to heaven at the first fall of snow  
  
He spoke of his angel a dear baby girl he loved every footstep he loved every
curl  
But she went to heaven just one year ago  
The angels came for her at the first fall of snow  
He still have the dolly that she used to love  
  
He held and caressed it and he gazed up above  
He whispered my darling you're waiting I know  
I'll bring you your dolly at the first fall of snow  
And there as I listened then my eyes filled with tears  
  
I knew she was part of his happier years  
His frail body trembled he spoke soft and low  
I'll be with my darling at the first fall of snow  
I just couldn't tell him how I felt inside  
  
I patted his shoulder my feeling's too high  
He smiled as we partred cause he didn't know  
That we'd lost our darling at the first fall of snow

Everybody calls me bo I got no money but I hold my row  
Some folks say I'm just a no good guy  
But I can ride for miles in old boxcar smoke cigarettes butts and used cigars  
Ridin' the Atlantic Coastal Line  
Hear that lonesome whistle whine smell that perfume of Georgia pines  
See that big moon roll above this hobo's life is a life I love  
Ridin' the Atlantic Coastal Line ridin' the Atlantic Coastal Line  
  
Well I had me a woman in Albany but a rowdy way's made a wreck of me  
And I had to get away before I lost my mind  
But as long as this rattler takes me around there ain't one woman gonna tie me
down  
Ridin' the Atlantic Coastal Line  
Hear that lonesome whistle whine Alabama and Caroline  
Florida Georgia Tennessee a hobo's life is a life for me  
Ridin' the Atlantic Coastal Line ridin' the Atlantic Coastal Line  
  
I make my coffee in a can but this bo ain't worried man  
Morning sun greets me with the shine  
I go south when the trade winds blow and I go north where there ain't no snow  
Ridin' the Atlantic Coastal Line  
Hear that lonesome whistle whine smell that perfume of Georgia pines  
See that big moon roll above this hobo's life is a life I love  
Ridin' the Atlantic Coastal Line ridin' the Atlantic Coastal Line

I had sunk as low as a man could go  
The world had turned me down  
Then you picked me up and kissed me sweet  
You changed a beggar into a king  
  
Yes you took the rags from off of my back  
And you gave me your love to keep me warm  
Yes you picked me up and you kissed me sweet  
You changed a beggar into a king  
  
I had walked the streets with head bowed low  
The sun for me would never shine  
Then you came along into my life  
And changed the beggar into a king  
  
Yes you took the rags from off of my back  
And you gave me your love to keep me warm  
Yes you picked me up and you kissed me sweet  
You changed a beggar into a king

You're mine for awhile till a new face appears  
And then you're no longer with me  
They call me a fool and laugh at my tears  
But they know I'll never be free.  
  
CHORUS  
Between fire and water  
That's where you got me  
I get burned every time I'm with you  
Between fire and water  
I cry an ocean  
Cause without you I'm bluer than blue  
  
My love cannot die though you break my heart  
I'll want you the rest of my days  
I try to forget but each time I start  
I'm still but a slave to your ways  
  
CHORUS  
Between fire and water  
That's where you got me  
I get burned every time I'm with you  
Between fire and water  
I cry an ocean  
Cause without you I'm bluer than blue

Beyond the reef where the sea is dark and cold  
My love has gone and my dreams grow old  
There'll be no tears there'll be no regretting will she remember me will she
forget  
I'll send a thousand flowers where the trade winds blow  
I'll send my lonely heart for I love her so  
Someday I know she'll come back again to me  
Till then my heart will be beyond the reef  
I'll send a thousand flowers

Dear Mother, said a poor blind boy  
That little bird sings very long  
And do you see him in his joy  
And is he pretty as his song?  
  
The mother looked and replied  
I see that bird on yonder tree  
The poor boy smiled and softly said  
Mother I wish that I could see.  
  
Yet, I the fragrant flowers can smell  
And I can feel the green leaves shade  
And I can hear the notes that swell  
From those dear birds that God has made.  
  
So mother God to me is kind  
Though sightless he has not given  
But tell me is there any blind  
Among the children up in heaven.  
  
Blind, oh no, my friend I am not blind  
My eyes may be closed but I don't mind  
For I see things far beyond your sight  
'Cause God gave me a sense to guide me alright.  
  
You don't understand  
How happy I can be  
Friend life's not made up alone  
Of what our eyes can see.  
  
Why you can see mountains  
And rivers and trees  
And you can find beauty in the flowers  
And the birds and the bees.  
  
Why I find a beauty  
That you'll never know  
The kind that comes from way inside  
The kind that comforts so.  
  
I've learned to think of everything  
As beautiful and bright  
'Cause God gave me that inner sense  
To take the place of light.  
  
Oh nom my darlin', they all see  
But why ask me, but why ask me you think so odd  
Why mother, God's so good to me  
I thought I'd like to look at God.  
  
Will be so nice when I can see  
But mother when you get up there  
Please tell me, mother, that it's you  
Because I've never saw you here,  
  
He said no more but fondly smiled  
Until the finale blow was given  
And God took up that poor blind boy  
And opened first his eyes in heaven...

When I see blossoms in the springtime  
I know that sweetheart time is here  
My love that blossoms in the springtime  
Blooms in my heart through all the year  
  
I love the blossoms in the springtime  
Kissed by the sunshine and the rain  
I love to hold you, oh my darlin'  
When kisses bloom in sweetheart's lane  
  
Sometimes a spark of love may smoulder  
Never to flame all winter long  
Then like the blossoms in the springtime  
Burst with the first red robin's song  
  
I love the blossoms in the springtime  
Kissed by the sunshine and the rain  
I love to hold you, oh my darlin'  
When kisses bloom in sweetheart's lane

It's been a blue blue day I feel like running away I feel like running away
from it all  
My love has been untrue she's found somebody new  
It's been a blue blue day for me  
I feel like crying dying what can I do  
I feel like praying saying I'm glad we're through  
It's been a blue blue day I feel like running away  
I feel like running away from the blues  
  
How can I make believe that I don't sit  
And grieve it's been a blue blue day for me  
I can't pretend and say that I don't love her anyway it's been a blue blue day
for me  
I feel like crying dying...  
I feel like running away from the blues

Tonight I'm blue for old Hawaii my weary sould is lonesome too  
She left me blue and broken hearted I've got them old Hawaii blues  
(Your big blue eyes and darkbrown curls dear made skies of grey turn into blue  
But now you've gone and lost forever I've got them old Hawaii blues)  
You left me down where drowsy waters roll on the shores of paradise  
You've had your way dear and we have parted for you old pal I dream tonight  
Perhaps some day your mind will wander back to the one who loves you true  
And I will still for you be waiting I've got them old Hawaii blues

The stars shine down on me only  
The moon is pale  
I search in vain  
For love on the lonely trail.  
  
I'm a blue ranger  
But my heart's in danger  
Would you bide awhile  
Or ride a mile along with me.  
  
On the lone prairie,  
Things were so contrary  
Love was in the air  
But none would share it's song with me.  
  
A moonlit trail  
A starlit sky above  
I cried a lonesome wail  
In search of love...

Blue rose of the Rio I can see her now  
As she looked that day when I rode away through a golden dawn  
It was there by the Rio that we made our vows  
Then we kissed goodbye what a fool was I fore I traveled on  
I should have known as we kissed such heaven as this could only be  
Paradise's lost if it would tossed away so free  
Must I wish for manana that will never come true  
Blue rose of the Rio my answer is you  
(I should have known)

I'm calling to tell you it's over yes darling you're now free to go  
You're saying you're sorry you hurt me but you hurt me much more than you know  
You're asking me where this call comes from oh I hope that you won't interfere  
In your new romance turns out a failure here's where you'll find me my dear  
I'm just on the blue side of lonesome right next to the Heartbreak Hotel  
In a tavern that's known as Three Teardrops on a barstool not doing so well  
The hands of the clock never alter for things never change in this place  
There's no present no past and no future for the ones who have lost in love's
race  
  
The hands of the clock

If you listen a story I'll tell you,  
Of a girl who once lived in this land  
A girl who was once my sweetheart,  
She was know as The Blue Velvet Band.  
  
On her cheeks was the first flush of nature,  
Her beauty, it seemed to expand,  
Her hair hung down in long tresses,  
Tied back with a blue velvet band.  
  
I can still see those tears as we parted,  
Of my heart broken Blue Velvet Band  
As I left I told her I'd never  
Come back to my old home again.  
  
Five years on the wide open spaces  
Was all that my poor heart could stand,  
Every night as I lay on my pillow,  
I would dream of my Blue Velvet Band.  
  
Then one night as I lay down dreaming  
Of home and poor mother and dad,  
Like a flash by my bedside was standing  
The form of my Blue Velvet Band.  
  
I started next day for my darling,  
Just to go back and make her my bride  
But as I reached the old country depot,  
They told my my sweet heart has died.  
  
They laid her to rest in the churchyard,  
Midst the sweet summer flowers of the land  
On her finger the ring I had bought her,  
On her head was a blue velvet band.

Something about you, mama  
That sure gives me the blues  
Something about you mama  
That sure gives me the blues  
It ain't your drop stitch stockings  
It ain't your blue buckled shoes.  
  
You know, purdy mama  
I'm bound to love you some  
You know, purdy mama  
I'm bound to love you some  
'Cause I've done more for you  
Than anybody ever done  
You know it, baby.  
  
Got me a purdy mama  
Got me a bulldog, too  
Got me a purdy mama  
Got me a bulldog, too  
My purdy mama don't love me  
But my bulldog do.  
  
There's been a groundhog rootin'  
Around my yard at night  
There's been a groundhog rootin'  
Around my yard at night  
From the way my mama been treatin' me  
He must be rootin' alright  
Lord have mercy.  
  
Well, I ain't no cheatin' man  
Don't try to fool no girls  
I ain't no cheatin' man  
Don't try to fool no girls  
It's my regular lovin'  
That gets me by in this world...

My ship set sail to Bluebird Island  
And slowly drifted out to sea  
Her silver sails to cross the ocean  
My lover's lonely heart set free  
Then out across the waves the bluebirds came one day  
Out over the silver sea, your message brought to me  
To sail my ship of love along the moonlit bay  
And anchor in the harbor of your heart  
The Trade Winds there on Bluebird Island  
Soon dried her lonely tears away  
The treasure eye found broken hearted  
Was locked within my heart to stay  
The Trade Winds there on Bluebird Island  
Soon dried her lonely tears away  
The treasure eye found broken hearted  
Was locked within my heart to stay  

Recorded by Hank Snow  
Born to lose, I've lived my life in vain  
Every dream has only brought me pain  
All my life I've always been so blue  
Born to lose and now I'm losing you.  
Born to lose, it seems so hard to bear  
How I long to always have you near  
You've grown tired and now you say we're through  
Born to lose and now I'm losing you.  
Born to lose, my every hope is gone  
It's so hard to face that empty dawn  
You were all the happiness I knew  
Born to lose and now I'm losing you.  
There's no use to dream of happiness  
All I see is only loneliness  
All my life I've always been so blue  
Born to lose and now I'm losing you  
Born to lose and now I'm losing you.

A cowboy with his sweetheart stood beneath a starlit sky  
Tomorrow he was leaving for the lonesome prairie wide  
She said "I'll be your lovingbride when you return someday"  
He handed her a broken ring and to her he did say  
  
"You'll find upon that ring sweetheart my name engraved in gold  
And I shall keep the other half which bears your name you know."  
He went away to ride and toil this cowboy brave and bold  
But long he stayed and while he strayed the maiden's love grew cold.  
  
Three years had passed, he did not some, and Nell will wed tonight  
Her father said an Earl would make her happy home so bright  
The lights were gaily glowing as they stood there side by side  
"Let's drink a toast to this young man and to his lovely bride."  
  
Just then there stood within the door a figure tall and slim  
A handsome cowboy was their guest and slowly he walked in  
"I'll drink with you a toast." said he, and quickly in her glass  
He dropped his half of wedding ring, then anxiously he watched.  
  
She tipped her glass and from her lips a ring fell shining bright  
The token she had longed to see lay there beneath the light  
"Though years have been between us dear, love won our last long fight,  
It's you my cowboy sweetheart and my Jack I'll wed tonight."

Dig down deep where the ground is cold  
(Dark and cold and all alone)  
Tired of life all alone and  
Blue happiness I never knew  
In this cold world  
There's nothing for me now  
Won't you hear my only plea  
And bury me deep  
Where the sun doesn't shine  
Because sunshine I've never known  
Dig down deep where the ground is cold  
Dark and cold and all alone  
You were my love  
Only love I knew  
And tonight I find I can't have you  
Trouble and tears are all that I see  
Now you are gone please hear my plea  
Bury me deep where the sun...

I rode your ocean liner to Newfoundland,  
Where I made a living in an iron mine.  
When I got my fill I went to Nova Scotia,  
And I fished the salty waters for a time.  
  
Passing through Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick,  
I could see the rocks and cliffs of solid stone.  
Listening to the seagulls calling to each other  
Made me miss my darling and my distant home.  
  
Canadian Pacific, carry me three thousand miles,  
Through the valleys and the forests,  
To the sunshine of her smile,  
'Cross the plains and the rugged mountains,  
Keep this wandering boy from harm.  
Canadian Pacific, take me to my baby's arms.  
  
The Atlantic disappeared on the horizon,  
And Quebec lay waiting for me down the track.  
For a while I drove a truck to keep from star-ving.  
In Ontario I was a lumber-jack.  
  
Man-itoba and Saskatchewan then followed,  
Where the wheat fields and the old Red River flowed.  
In the quiet hours your whistling on the prairie,  
Touched my heart and set my memories aglow.  
  
I could feel the nearness of her warm, sweet kisses,  
When you rolled into Alberta westward bound.  
I worked on an oil rig to make some money,  
For a ticket to the sweetest girl around.  
  
Pushing on past Lake Louise in all it's splendor,  
Where the trees and Rockies touch the sky above,  
I got to British Columbia and heaven,  
On your track I made it back to my true love.  
  
Canadian Pacific, carry me three thousand miles,  
Through the valleys and the forests,  
To the sunshine of her smile.  
'Cross the plains and the rugged mountains,  
Keep this wandering boy from harm.  
Canadian Pacific, take me to my baby's arms.

Hey, pretty mama, I'm as blue as the skies above  
Hey, pretty mama, you're the only woman I love  
And your daddy's gonna love you  
But I just can't have you blues (honey, ease my mind)  
  
You told me if I called you on the phone tonight you'd be in  
What makes you tell me them lies when you know it's a dog gone sin  
I guess I'll have to settle for  
Them lovin' can't have you blues (she just wasn't there, that's all)  
  
You may be havin' your fun you may be out on the run, that's fine  
But a love like yours, baby, someday is bound to go blind  
So come home because your daddy's got  
Them love you can't have you blues (you gotta change your mind)  
  
I've reached my verdict that you women are all the same  
You run away and leave me then you say I got myself to blame  
So come on back, daddy's got them  
Love you can't have you blues (I'll never change my mind)  
  
If I look at the wall that old wall looks back at me  
Everywhere that I look it's the same old colour to me (blue)  
So hurry home, daddy's got  
Them love you can't have you blues

On days like this we would linger by the ocean  
Then we would dream as we lay there side by side  
I don't know why but one day you got the notion  
To sit and watch for the changing of the tide  
And then he came just to ask a foolish question  
But jealousy in my heart I could not hide  
Though I don't believe it was really your intention  
In your eyes I saw the changing of the tide  
Now you're gone from me all you left to me is the restless sea to keep me
company  
Now I'm here alone where we used to be together  
I can't forget guess I never really try  
Fool that I am I'll go on and on forever just watching for the changing of the
tide

Christmas roses to you I'm sending  
May they bring the Christmas joy though we're apart  
Christmas roses will say I love you as the tender message echoes from my heart  
Though I can't be with you on this Christmas Day  
Remember that I'll always love you though I'm far away  
Christmas roses to you I'm sending  
May they bring the Christmas joy though we're apart  
Though I can't be with you...

Looking through the window of the greyhound station down in San Antone  
Watching people come and people go and feeling so alone  
And every face I see reminds me of the one I've left behind me crying  
Knowing I should go back home and heaven knows how hard I'm trying  
  
To see that Colorado country morning with the dusty roads and warm sunshine  
I've got the Colorado country morning and a Denver woman on my mind  
I remember standing at the door and looking back as she lay sleeping  
  
And very gently through the window pane the morning sun was creeping  
And without a sound I turned around and softly kissed her goodbye  
Now with all behind I often find myself wondering why  
I left that Colorado country morning  
I left that Colorado country morning

Oh conscience I'm guilty I'm guilty again  
Now I'm driving home slowly my spirit's so low  
I cheated on her again and why I'll never know  
I hope I don't look too guilty when she lets me in  
Oh conscience don't ever let me do that again  
Oh conscience I'm guilty and I must confess  
Why I kissed her I knew I love the other one best  
I've been out with an old flame who's heart's full of sin  
Oh conscience don't ever let me do that again  
Between right and the wrong the love and desire  
This game that I'm playing more dangers than fire  
I might talk in my sleep or be caught by her friend  
Oh conscience don't ever let me do that again  
Oh conscience I'm guilty

All day I've faced a barren waste  
Without the taste of water, cool water  
Old Dan and I with throats burned dry  
And souls that cry for water  
Cool, clear, water  
  
Keep a-movin, Dan, dontcha listen to him, Dan  
He's a devil, not a man  
He spreads the burning sand with water  
Dan, can ya see that big, green tree?  
Where the water's runnin' free  
And it's waitin' there for me and you?  
  
The nights are cool and I'm a fool  
Each star's a pool of water  
Cool water  
But with the dawn I'll wake and yawn  
And carry on to water  
Water, water, water  
  
Keep a-movin, Dan, dontcha listen to him, Dan  
He's a devil, not a man  
He spreads the burning sand with water  
Dan, can ya see that big, green tree?  
Where the water's runnin' free  
And it's waitin' there for me and you?  
  
Cool, clear, water  
Cool, clear, water

I never saw the world lookin' so bright  
Never saw the wheels turnin' so right  
And I'm glad to be ridin'  
This crazy little train of love  
  
I'm just like a kid on a merry-go-round  
I'm so high in the clouds, I hope I never come down  
And I'm glad that I'm ridin'  
This crazy little train of love  
  
Our train don't carry the blues  
No room for hurtin' or any bad news  
Our train is just loaded with love  
Just you and I, and that's enough  
  
It just keeps a-chuggin' on down the track  
We're so in love, we don't want to look back  
Aren't you glad that we're ridin'  
This crazy little train of love  
  
I see our destination just over the hill  
Cozy little place that they call Arborsville  
Aren't you glad to be ridin'  
This crazy little train of love  
  
The wheels sing the song as they roll down the track  
They seem to say I love you with each clickety-clack  
Aren't you glad that we're ridin'  
This crazy little train of love  
  
Our train don't carry the blues  
No room for hurtin' or any bad news  
Our train is just loaded with love  
Just you and I, and that's enough  
  
It just keeps a-chuggin' on down the track  
We're so in love, we don't want to look back  
Aren't you glad that we're ridin'  
This crazy little train of love

On the Chisholm Trail it was midnight Carmela was strong on his mind  
Because of the life he had chosen Carmela had left then behind  
Too long he'd been a bandito Carmela had left him alone  
But today someone brought a message she'd be seen in old San Antone  
Cross the Brazos at Waco ride on and I make it by dawn  
Cross the Brazos at Waco I'm safe when I reach San Antone  
  
He glanced back over his shoulder the posse were nowhere in sight  
He'd sent for Carmela to meet him at the banks of the Brazos tonight  
She was waiting and he kept the promise he'd made such a long time ago  
As he dropped the guns that she hated in the mighty Brazos below  
Cross the Brazos at Waco ride on and I make it by dawn  
Cross the Brazos at Waco I'll walk straight in old San Antone  
  
Then the night came alight with gun fire he knew that at last he'd been found  
As the ranger's band shoot brightly and bandito laid on the ground  
Carmela knew he was dying that all of her dreams were in vain  
As she kissed his lips for the last time she heard him whisper again  
Cross the Brazos at Waco ride on and I make it by dawn  
Cross the Brazos at Waco I'm safe when I reach San Antone  
  
I'm safe when I reach San Antone

I've got a sort of lowdown feeling a sickness that is hard to describe  
It ain't no use to call a doctor cause the cure I know he couldn't prescribe  
Day by day I'm gradually failin' guess it's just a matter of time  
It's started in my mind and infected my heart  
Baby when you said goodbye  
[ piano ]  
I thought that I was slowly improvin' when the tears began to dry  
Then I passed you on the corner and it took the rainbow out of my sky  
So baby won't you hear my pleadin' your love would really pull me through  
It would heal my troubled mind leave these heartaches behind  
Cause you're the only cure for the blues  
[ guitar ]  
I strolled beside that muddy Mississippi and as the evening sun sank low  
That naggin' deep inside said jump boy but the longin' in my heart said no  
I guess that I'll continue on a walking and maybe Lady Luck will come through  
Then contentment I will find in my troublesome mind  
Cause baby you're the cure for the blues  
Cause baby you're the cure for the blues  
  
  

A laughing baby boy one evening in his play  
Disturbed the household with his noisy glee  
I warned him to be quiet but he soon would disobey  
For he would soon forget a word from me  
  
I called him to my side and said, "now son you go to bed  
Your conduct has been very, very rude"  
With quivering lips and tear filled eyes he pleaded then with me  
"Don't make me go to bed papa and I'll be good."  
  
Don't papa and I'll be good  
Don't papa and I'll be good"  
That's what I heard him say and it haunts me night and day  
"Don't make me go to bed papa and I'll be good."  
  
Our lives have just been gladdened by his bright ascending beam  
Our boy now in our hearts was very dear  
We hastened to his bed one night he was talking in his sleep  
He didn't seem to know that we were near.  
  
I took him in my arms and found his body "raked" with pain  
To ease the pain we did the best we could  
It broke my heart to hear him cryin' loudly in his sleep  
"Don't make me go to bed papa and I'll be good."  
  
All night and day we watched and prayed, we never left his side  
To give him up it seemed we never could  
It broke my heart to hear him crying just before he died  
"Don't make me go to bed papa and I'll be good."

Down the trail of achin' hearts where nobody's hidin' their tears  
You sent me there where sadness starts down the trail of achin' hearts  
You told me I was your darling you kept me hanging around  
Somebody else is your darling now lonesome and blue I'll be found  
Down the trail...  
[ guitar ]  
Once I was passing your window under the light of a star  
Somebody else played my love song and played it on my old guitar  
Down the trail...  
  
  

Beneath the moon tonight  
I kneel close to my darling's side,  
Her eyes in death forever closed,  
My sweet and future bride.  
  
Beside some lonely river bank,  
Where the weeping willow grow,  
I'll ease my aching heart tonight,  
Down where the dark waters flow.  
  
I planted on her new made grave  
A tender rose with care,  
To bloom through' all the lonely years  
While she is lying there.  
  
I'll place one tender kiss of love  
Upon that budding rose,  
And bid my world of cares goodbye  
Down where the dark waters flow.

Out in the west Texas town of El Paso I fell in love with a Mexican girl  
Nighttime would find me in Rosa's Cantina music would play and Feleena would
whirl  
Blacker than night were the eyes of Feleena wicked and evil while casting a
spell  
My love was deep for this Mexican maiden I was in love but in vain I could
tell  
  
One night a wild young cowboy came in wild as the west Texas wind  
Dashing and daring a drink he was sharing with wicked Feleena the girl that I
loved  
So in danger I challenged his right for the love of this maiden  
Down went his hand for the gun that he wore  
  
My challenge was answered in less than a heartbeat  
The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor  
Just for a moment I stood there in silence shocked by the foul deed I had done  
Many thoughts raced through my mind as I stood there  
  
I had but one chance and that was to run  
Out to the backdoor of Rosa's I ran out where the horses were tied  
I caught a good one it looked like it could run up on its back and away I did
ride  
Just as fast as I could from the west Texas town of El Paso  
  
Out to the badlands of New Mexico  
Back in El Paso my life would be worthless everything's gone in life nothing
is left  
It's been so long since I've seen the young maiden  
My love is stronger than my fear of death  
  
I saddled up and away I did go riding alone in the dark  
Maybe tomorrow a bullet would find me  
Tonight nothing's worse than this pain in my heart  
And at last here I am on the hill overlooking El Paso I can see Rosa's Cantina
below  
  
My love is strong and it pushes me onward down off the hill to Feleena I go  
Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys off to my left ride a dozen or more  
Shouting and shooting I can't let them catch me  
I have to make it to Rosa's backdoor  
  
Something is dreadfuly wrong for I feel a deep burning pain in my side  
Though I am trying to stay in the saddle I'm getting weary unable to ride  
But my love for Feleena is strong and I rise where I've fallen  
Though I am weary I can's stop to rest  
  
I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle I feel the bullet go deep in my
chest  
From out of nowhere Feleena has found me kissing my cheeks as she kneels by my
side  
Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for one little kiss then Feleena
goodbye

A little child on a sickbed lay and death was very near  
She was the pride and only child of a railroad engineer  
His duty had called him from those he loved and seeing that hope was dim  
While a tear he shed to his wife he said just have two lanterns trimmed  
Just hang a light as I pass tonight hang it where it can be seen  
If our baby's dead just show the red if she's better then show the green  
  
In a little house by the railroad track a mother with watchful eye  
Saw a gleam of hope and a feeble smile as the train went rushing by  
Just one short look was his only chance to see the light agleam  
In the midnight air there arose a prayer thank God the light was green  
Just hang a light

Now talk about Hawaii I didn't know it was so grand  
I pick me out a hula hula girl before my boat could land everybody does it in
Hawaii  
Now she's got it here and she's got it there  
Her lips are red her little ole feet are bare  
She shy on close but I don't care cause everybody does it in Hawaii  
  
Now when I leave Hawaii when I leave ole Waikiki  
I'm goin' to take my hula hula girl and bring her back with me  
'Cause everybody does it in Hawaii  
She's got two pretty legs with dimple knees  
Two brown arms and they know how to squeeze  
A perfect form and I'm hard to pelase but everybody does it in Hawaii

Diesel smoke climbin' to the clear blue sky I sit here wonderin' wanderin' why  
I leave her everytime I love her  
Green grass growin' by picket fence Lord I just don't make no sense  
But I leave her everytime I love her  
I guess it's just to my blood to roam I ain't never had no permanent home  
So I leave her everytime I love her  
I guess it's just knowin' that she'll be there  
With her dark brown eyes and her yellow hair  
And I love her Lord knows I love her  
Though my mind's dis-satisfied just a hoppin' that big ole Mack and ride  
And leave her everytime I love her  
I guess it's just to my blood to roam I ain't never had no permanent home  
So I leave her everytime I love her  
  
One of these days I want to go back  
To that yelllow haired girl and the tumble down shack  
And never leave her all I do is love her  
Well I guess to that I'll be content  
Just to drivin' this track and sendin' home the rent  
And leave her everytime I love her  
Well I guess it's just to my blood to roam I ain't never had no permanent home  
So I leave her everytime I love her  
You guess it I really love her

Summer's gone and wintertime's a comin' and where I am ain't where I want to
be  
I can hear my southern home a callin' and it's callin' out that old wide goose
and me  
I got kids and kin down in Kentucky I got lots of aunts in Alabam  
Mom a waitin' down in Mississippi and my sist's in Carolina's honey land  
Flyin' flyin' south to Dixie Lord I've been so lonesome and alone  
Stayin' ain't no use because my heart's an old wild goose  
And so tomorrow I'll be flyin' south for home  
  
Grandma and grandpa's down in Georgia and my sweetheart's down in Tennessee  
There's a little part of all the southland in my heart  
And honey in the south is where I want to be  
Summer's gone and wintertime's a comin' and where I am ain't where I want to
be  
I can hear my southern home a callin' and it's callin' out that old wide goose
and me  
Flyin' flyin' south to Dixie...  
And tomorrow I'll be flyin' south for home

It's by far the hardest thing I've ever done  
To be so in love with you and so alone  
Follow me where I go what I do and who I know  
Make it part of you to be a part of me  
Follow me up and down all the way and all around  
Take my hand and I will follow too  
It's long been on my mind you know it's been a long long time  
I'll try to find a way that I can make you understand  
The way I feel about you just how much I need you  
To be there where I can talk to you when there's no one else around  
Follow me where I go...  
You see I'd like to share my life with you and show you things I've seen  
Places where I'm going to places where I've been  
To have you there beside me and never feel alone  
And all the time that you're with me then we will be at home  
Follow me where I go what I do and who I know  
Make it part of you to be a part of me  
Follow me up and down all the way take my hand and I will follow too

I hear that train a-commin', it's rollin' around the bend  
And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when  
I'm stuck in Folsom prison and time keeps draggin' on  
But that train keeps a-rollin' on down to San Antone  
When I was just a baby, my mama told me, son  
Always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns  
But I shot a man in Reno, just to watch him die  
When I hear that whistle blowin', I hang my head and cry  
  
I bet there's rich folks eatin' in a fancy dining car  
They're probably drinking coffee and smoking big cigars  
But I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free  
But those people keep a-movin' and that's what tortures me  
  
Well if that freed me from this prison  
and that railroad train was mine  
I bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line  
Far from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stay  
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away

How long will my teardrops be falling for you  
Forever and one day, forever and two  
How long will my arms ache to hold only you  
Forever and one day, forever and two

Now Frankie and Johnny were sweethearts oh Lord how they could love  
Swore to be true to each other true as the stars above  
He was her man but he wasn't doin' her wrong  
Now Frankie went down to the corner just for a bucket of beer  
She said Mr Bartender has my loving Johnny been here  
He's my man he wouldn't do me wrong  
I don't want to cause you no trouble woman I ain't gonna lie  
But I saw your lover an hour ago with a girl named Nellie Blie  
He's your man but he's doin' you wrong  
Now Frankie looked over with transom she saw to her surprise  
There on the cab sat Johnny making love to Nellie Blie  
He's my man but he's doin' me wrong  
Frankie went back to comoda took out her little 44  
Rutty too-too three times she shot right through that hardwood door  
Shot her man he was doin' her wrong  
  
Now bring out your rubber tied hearses bring out the rubber tied hatch  
I'm taken said the man to the graveyard but only six of 'em called him back  
He was my man but he done me wrong  
Bring round a thousand policemen bring 'em around today  
To lock me down in that dungeon cell and throw that key away  
I shot my man he was doin' me wrong  
Now Frankie she said to the warden what are they goin' to do  
The warden he said to Frankie it's the electric chair for you  
You shot your man he was doin' you wrong  
Now this story has no moral this story has no end  
This story just goes to show that there ain't no good in man  
He was her man but he done her wong

If you ever go across the sea to Ireland  
Then maybe at the closing of the day  
You will sit and watch the moon rise over forest  
And see the sun go down on Galway Bay  
Just to hear again the ripple of the trout stream  
The women in the meadows making hay  
And to sit beside a turn fire in the cabin  
And watch the barefoot cousins at their play  
(For the strangers came and tried to teach us fairway  
They scorn us just for being what we are  
But they might as well go chasing after moonbeams  
Or buy a penny candle from a star)  
And if there's goin' to be a life hereafter  
And somehow I am sure there's going to be  
I will ask my God to let me make my heaven  
In that here land across the Ivy sea

Have you ever heard a love song that you didn't understand  
Were you ever in a tea house on the Island of Japan  
And have you ever traveled over many thousand miles  
To see a pretty Geisha girl dressed in Oriental style  
They've read it in the Tealeaves and it's written in the sand  
I found love by the heartfull in the foreign distant land  
Tell the homefolks that I'm happy with someone who's true I know  
I love a pretty Geisha girl where the ocean breezes blow  
  
I have stood and watched the sunrise by the waters of the sea  
And wondered how much beauty in this whole world can that be  
My dreams are all worth dreaming and it makes my life worth while  
To see a pretty Geisha girl dressed in Oriental style  
(They've read it in the Tealeaves )

It's knowing that your door is always open and your path is free to walk  
That makes me tend to leave my sleepin' bag rolled up and stashed behind your
couch  
And it's knowin' I'm not shacked by forgotten words and bons  
And the ink stains that have dried upon some line  
That keeps you in the back roads by the rivers of my mem'ry  
That keeps you ever gentle on my mind  
It's not clinging to the rocks and I'd be planted on their columns now that
binds me  
Or somethin' that somebody said because they thought we fit together walking  
It's just knowin' that the world will not be cursin' or forgivin'  
When I walk along some railroad track and find  
That you're moving on the back roads by the rivers of my mem'ry  
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind  
Though the wheet fields and the clothes lines  
And the junk yards and the highways come between us  
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother cause she turned and I was gone  
I still run in silence tears of joy might stain my face  
And summer sun might burn me till I'm blind  
But not to where I cannot see you walkin' on the back roads  
By the rivers flowing gentle on my mind  
I dipped my cup of soap back from a gurgling crackling caltron in some train
yard  
My beard a roughen coal pile and a dirty hat pulled low across my face  
Through cupped hands round a tin can I pretend I hold you to my breast and
find  
That you're waving from the back roads by the rivers of my mem'ry  
Ever smiling ever gentle on my mind  
That you're waving from the back roads by the rivers of my mem'ry  
Ever smiling ever gentle on my mind

It was early in the fall and a blowin' up a squall  
From the trestle you could hear the weirdest moans  
With a mighty lonesome cry came a whistle from the sky  
And it chilled the very marrow in my bones  
  
Then a loud rushing roar like you never heard before  
Turned the blood to icy water in my veins  
As I watched with rising fear something strange was drawing near  
And I saw in the clouds ghost trains  
  
(Ghost trains ghost trains what a fearful sight)  
The Cannonball and No 9 were racing through the night  
Just as they passed me by I heard the engineer cry  
Giver her coal give her coal shovel it on  
  
You could see the fireman grinnin' in the engine that was winnin'  
But I knew before the finish they'd be gone  
(Well he knew before the finish they'd be gone)  
You could see the drivers roll as they shoveled on the coal  
  
And the black smoke came pouring from the stacks  
As they thundered through the sky I am here to testify  
You could hear the wheel a clickin' on the tracks  
Through the smoke and the steam you could see the headlights gleam  
  
Now I have no proof but still the fact remains  
You may doubt it but I swear there were cinders in my hair  
When I saw in the clouds ghost trains  
(Ghost trains ghost trains...  
  
As I watched I saw them fade into the dawn  
(As he watched he saw them fade into the dawn)

Glory hallujah we are marching on  
(As we sing this song and it won't be long)  
The man of Galilee will set us everyone free  
So get in the gloryland march  
There is an army that is marching onto victory  
The Captain is a man from Galilee  
They've all been saved and their souls set free  
By the blood of the Lamb on calvary  
So won't you join in the Spirit and be saved today  
Get on your knees and pray  
Help lead the wrong to right come join in the fight  
And get in the gloryland march  
Glory hallujah we are marching...  
[ steel - fiddle - guitar ]  
Blessed is the army that will follow God  
Longing for His kingdom as we onward trod  
Waiting for that moment when we leave the sod  
To live in peace forever in the presence of God  
He will give us power over man and sin we'll shout and enter in  
We'll hear the victory ring when we've found our Saviour King  
So get in the gloryland march  
Glory hallujah we are marching...  
  

In a class room at the grade school just before the Hollidays  
Boys and girls were writing notes to Santa far away  
Expect a lad who sat alone his paper put away  
And when his teacher asked him why so softly he did say  
Oh God is my Santa Claus each and every day  
I don't write him letters ma'm I just kneel and pray  
Don't you know his greatest gift salvation is afound  
God is my Santa Claus each day the whole you're round  
  
Then the teacher stood in silence after what the child had said  
He really knew real Christmas day and not from books he'd read  
He truly met real Santa Clause he said him just one word  
God gave his praise for Christmas day my Santa Clause is God  
(God is my Santa Claus each and every day  
I don't write him letters ma'm I just kneel and pray)  
Do you know his greatest gift salvation is afonud  
God to be my Santa Claus each day the whole you're round

I hate to see night shadows fall, I hate to see a moon above  
For it brings me dreams of days gone by  
When my darling Lola Lee strolled along the shore with me  
And we watched the golden river glide on by.  
  
[Chorus]  
Golden river, golden river, you took my love from me  
On your waves of golden hue, you carried her with you  
And broke my heart a million, million ways.  
  
Now I sit and wonder why I feel so blue and want to cry  
While I watch the moon climb slowly in the sky.  
It was on a night like this when she gave me her last kiss  
Climbed in her birch canoe and sailed away.  
  
[Chorus]

You're a tired buckeroo little pal  
You've been ridin' hard all day little pal  
Soon the sandman will be callin'  
As the twilight shadows fall  
And you'll go ridin' down the milky way.  
  
Chorus:  
So lay your curly head upon your pillow  
While your faithful dog stands watching over you  
Close your tired little eyes  
While I croon a lullaby  
And you'll ride the trail to dreamland, buckeroo.  
  
Mr. Moon is shining high up above  
And your eyes they soon will close my little love  
So sweet dreams until the dawn  
When the sandman will be gone  
And a new day then will ghreet you buckeroo.  
  
Chorus:  
So lay your curly head upon your pillow  
While your faithful dog stands watching over you  
Close your tired little eyes  
While I croon a lullaby  
And you'll ride the trail to dreamland, buckeroo...

The old hometown looks the same  
As I step down from the train  
And there to meet me is my mama and papa  
And down the road I look and there runs Mary  
Hair of gold and lips like cherries  
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home.  
  
Yes, they'll all come to meet me  
Arms a-reaching, smiling sweetly  
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home.  
  
The old house is still standing  
Though the paint is cracked and dry  
And there's that old oak tree that I used to play on  
Down the lane I walk with my sweet Mary  
Hair of gold and lips like cherries  
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home.  
  
And then suddenly I awake and look around me  
At these cold grey walls that surround me  
And it's then that I realize that I was only dreaming  
For there stands a guard and there's the sad old padre  
Arm in arm we'll walk at daybreak  
And once again I'll touch the green, green grass of home.  
  
Yes, they'll all come to see me in the shade of that old oak tree  
As they lay me 'neath the green, green grass of home...

Gypsy feet will wander Gypsy feet will stray  
Neither love nor thunder can ever make them stay  
I can't tame a heart so wild like a jungle drum it beats  
Were you born a devil child with the restless gypsy feet  
Gypsy feet keep dancing to the tune of violin  
Just like devil's prancing you dance away your sins  
If I could tame your restless heart would make my life complete  
But I can't put an anchor on your gypsy feet  
  
My picture's in your locket on that golden chain  
Money's in your pocket and you're gone again  
Gypsy lips will promise vows that they never keep  
Hearts like mine are crumbled beneath your gypsy feet  
Gypsy feet keep dancing...

I'm handcuffed to the only love I knew  
Yet I never committed any crime  
Like a prisoner alone in his cell  
I'm hundcuffed to the love I've thought was mine  
There's no way out and no one to ease my pain  
My memories are haunting me in vain  
You promised to be always at my side  
Forever until the end of time  
Now you're laughing at the tears I cannot hide  
I'm hundcuffed to the love I've thought was mine  
  
I'm handcuffed to the only love I knew  
Like a prisoner a serving a lifetime  
Oh Lord I need your helping hand I'm hundcuffed  
To the love I've thought was mine  
There's no way out and no one to ease my pain  
My memories are haunting me in vain  
I pray you will return to me  
And remain until to end of time  
Please open th pathway to your heart  
I'm hundcuffed to the love I've thought was mine

I loved you before you met him and I loved even after you were wed  
I told you I'd never forget you that I'd be here when his love was dead  
Now you're back in my arms and I'm happy  
And I guess he knows just where he stands  
'Cause when he lied and cheated on you that's when he dropped the world in my
hands  
  
Didn't he realize what he was losing to give you up he must happened insane  
And to him it just didn't seem to matter that his love was another man's game  
It's his right if he wants to be a fool but I wonder if he really understands  
That when he gave your love back to me that's when he dropped the world in my
hands

A cowboy return to the scene of his childhood  
To his sweetheart of long long ago  
But today he returns she was wed to another  
Tells the story of heartbreak and woe  
  
Cowboy ridin'  
Sorrow hidin'  
Head bowed lonesome and blue  
Church bells ringin'  
  
Boy sat singin'  
Someone sayin' adieu  
Love's old sweet song  
Was never meant to turn out wrong  
  
Even in a cowboy's song 'bout old pal  
I guess we strayed too long  
Yes sir, heaven bless her  
Either caress her  
  
As we ride the heartbreak trail  
(Love's old sweet song...  
Was never meant to turn out wrong.)

Give when you give  
The best of your service  
Telling the world that  
The Saviour has come  
  
Be not dismayed when  
Man don't believe you  
He'll understand  
And say well done  
  
Oh when I come to  
The end of my journey  
Weary of life  
And the battle is won  
  
Carrying the staff  
And the cross of redemption  
He'll understand  
And say well done  
  
Misunderstood yes  
The Savior of sinners  
Died on the cross  
He was God's only son  
Oh hear him calling  
  
His father in heaven  
Not my will, Lord  
But then be done  
And when I come...

Well look who's comin' through the door  
I think we've met somewhere before hello love hello love  
Where in the world have you been so long  
I've missed you so since you've been gone hello love hello love  
Make yourself feel right at home  
I hope you plan on staying long come in love come in love  
I must say I was sure surprised  
You're the last thing I expected by hello love hello love  
I've heard it said time and again you often go back where you've been  
I really didn't believe it was true but I left the door unlocked for you  
I'll try to please you in every way  
Assure you of a pleasant stay this time love this time love  
I've been so blue since you've been gone  
Now you're back with me and nothing's wrong hello love hello love

And it's wonderful now you're back with me  
And things are like they used to be remember love remember love  
You're back with me now and my world's complete  
So don't mind me if I repeat hello love hello love hello love hello love

His hands paint the flowers  
He puts leaves on the trees  
At his whisper birds start singing  
When my heart needs melodies  
  
Why I strayed from all his goodness  
My poor mind can't understand  
I'm to blame for my misfortune  
I lost hold of his hands  
  
Those hands that gave me mercy  
When I'm wrong as wrong can be  
If they really gave me justice  
I'd be lost on homeless sea  
  
I've been lost in the shuffle  
I've obeyed the wrong commands  
I'm going back to the chapel  
In search of his hands  
Those hands that gave me mercy

Riding on an East-bound freight train, speeding through the night  
Hobo Bill, a railroad bum, was fighting for his life...  
The sadness of his eyes revealed the torture of his soul  
He raised a weak and weary hand to brush away the cold.  
  
Ho-ho-o Bo-o-o Bil-lie!  
  
No warm lights flickered around him, no blankets there to fold  
Nothing but, the howling wind and the driving rain, so cold  
When he heard a whistle blowing, in a dreamy kind of way  
The hobo seemed contented for he smiled there where he lay.  
  
Ho-ho-o Bo-o-o Bil-lie!  
  
Outside the rain was fallin' on that lonesome boxcar door  
But the little form of Hobo Bill lay still upon the floor  
As the train sped through the darkness and the raging storm outside  
No one knew that Hobo Bill was taking his last ride.  
  
It was early in the mornin' when they raised the hobo's head  
The smile still lingered on his face, but Hobo Bill was dead  
There was no mother's longin', to soothe his weary soul  
For he was just a railroad bum, who died out in the cold.

Tonight as I lay on a boxcar just waiting for a train to pass by  
What will become of the hobo whenever his time comes to die  
Has the Master up yonder in heaven got a place that we might call our home  
Will we have to work for a living or must we continue to roam  
Will there be any freight trains in heaven any boxcars in which we might hide  
Will there be any tough cops and brakemen will they tell us that we cannot
ride  
Will the hobo chum with the rich man will we always have money to spare  
Will they hand respect for a hobo in that land that lies hidden up there  
[ fiddle - ac.guitar ]  
Will there be any freight trains...  
  
  

I know somewhere out in the world  
There is a gal for me  
I'd like to find and make you mine  
How happy we would be ...  
We wouldn't need a moonlit night  
To sit outdoors and spoon  
'Cause I would buy a rocket ship  
And take you to the moon.  
  
We would have our honeymoon  
On the rocket ship  
We would fly from star to star  
On our wedding trip  
You could make your wedding gown  
Out of a big moon-beam  
Sprinkle stardust in your hair  
You'd be a perfect dream.  
  
We'd sit on top of the universe  
With no one else around  
I'd reach right up and pick the stars a  
Ad make you a pretty crown.  
I'd place it on your little head  
And kiss your smiling lips  
As we glided out through space  
Upon the rocket ship  
  
CHORUS  
  
Then we'd go strolling arm in arm  
Along the milky way  
We would visit every planet  
On our wedding day  
We would laugh and love sweetheart  
And you could be my wife  
We would find the land of love  
Out there in paradise.  
  
We would have our honeymoon,  
On the rocket ship  
We would fly from star to star,  
On our wedding trip  
I'd take my old guitar along  
And we could softly croon  
On our journey through the sky  
And headed for the moon.

Though men may strife to go  
Beyond the reap of space  
To walk beyond the distance shining stars  
This world's a room so small  
Within my master's house  
The open sky's but a portion of his yard  
How big is God how big and wide is his domain  
To try to tell these lips can only start  
He's big enough to rule the mighty universe  
Yet small enough to live within my heart  
  
As winter chill may cause the tiny seed to fall  
To lie asleep till wake by summer's rain  
The heart grown cold will warm  
And trod with life anew  
The Master's touch will bring the glow again  
How big is God

Come listen to my tale 'bout a pretty little girl  
That I chanced to meet on the prairie  
T'was a night in June by the western moon  
That I met my charming Mary  
Her eyes were as bright as the stars that night  
When she smiled my heart did bubble  
She couldn't make love or turtle dove  
But, oh boy, She could yodel  
  
She yodeled a yodel as sweet as it could be  
Her heart was as pure as pretty yellow gold  
But love meant nothin', she was too cold  
But boy, oh boy, oh boy how she could yodel  
  
Well, I said to myself, you silly little elf  
I'll win her heart, that's settled  
I tried to hiss that pretty little miss  
But, oh my, how she battled  
She called me names made me feel so ashamed  
Then she said my fire is nobel  
Then she turned me down, didn't want me around  
But, oh boy, how she yodeled  
  
She yodeled a yodel as sweet as it could be  
Her heart was as pure as pretty yellow gold  
But love meant nothin', she was too cold  
But boy, oh boy, oh boy how she could yodel  
  
Next night on thr trail I heard a big wail  
She changed her mind, felt sorry  
Her yodel, you see, was meant for me  
And she said, you had me worried  
I've rode out tonight to make things right  
And I hope you will forgive me  
When I said, why yes, she took a deep breath  
And, oh boy, how she yodeled  
  
She yodeled a yodel as sweet as it could be  
Her heart was as pure as pretty yellow gold  
And it turned to warm from icy cold  
But boy, oh boy, oh boy how she did yodel  
  
Well, then we got married and what do you think  
We're as happy as the birds in the treeses  
Her love is so true and I'm tellin' you  
Her heart no more it freezes  
In a cradle of pine there's a baby devine  
And he never, never grumbles  
He's our own little pet and we can't talk yet  
But I wish you could hear him yodel  
  
He yodels a yodel as sweet as it could be  
He's our own little pet and we love him, you bet  
It don't mean a thing that he can't talk yet  
But he's spendin' his time just learning the way to yodel

On the isle of Filla Lilla out Hawaii way  
A hula maiden gay strolled by on moonlit bay  
There came to court her over the water from a savage Zinga Zululand  
A bolo chief-tain grand sang her this lay  
And he sang hula Hawaii hula smile on your zing gang a zula  
Moonshine above on our sweet jungle love  
For you my bolo is swinging for you my love song I'm singing  
Come be my hula hula love  
[ steel ]  
But the chief-tain from the peaceful Filla Lilla land  
Would not give him her hand her love took his stand  
Through the rattle of the battle as she heard his sweet voice calm and true  
They fled in his canoe o'er waters blue  
And he sang hula...  
And he sang hula...  
Hula love hula love hula love  
  
  

Hawaii's callin'  
When I hear the rhythm of the hula rock, hula rock  
  
In the South Pacific where the trade winds blow  
They thought that the hula was a little bit slow  
So they stepped it up with a go, go, go  
And that's where they got that rock and roll  
  
In the South Pacific now, they're gettin' with it  
On the beach at Waikaki  
And it's a lula when they try the hula  
With a rockin', rollin' beat  
  
Take me back where the trade winds blow  
To the land of the hula where they never get old  
And the gooney birds dance with a go, go, go  
And the natives join in with a rock and roll  
  
With me it's a riddle how they break in the middle  
And yet stay on the beat  
But I want to sway with 'em when I hear the rhythm  
Of the rockin' hula beat  
  
Rockin' and a-rollin' in Waikaki  
Rockin' and a-rollin' in Waikaki  
Rockin' and a-rollin' in Waikaki  
Rockin' and a-rollin' in Waikaki  
Don't stop just let her rock  
  
Hawaii's callin'

An' along came a fella who apparently had been on the go  
Well, he started in a-braggin' 'bout ev'rywhere he'd been

Though I should say goodbye to you I can't control my heart  
It won't obey, my heart must stay with you  
You brought me a tear with each kiss you brought to me  
You taught me how painful love can be  
  
It makes no difference what you do I can't control my heart  
And though you stray my heart must stay with you  
For you alone it's beating, I love you it's repeating  
With all my soul I can't control my heart  
  
You brought me a tear with each kiss you brought to me  
You taught me how painful love can be  
It makes no difference what you do I can't control my heart  
And though you stray my heart must stay with you  
  
For you alone it's beating, I love you it's repeating  
With all my soul I can't control my heart

My love has gone my pride has gone I care no more  
My heart is tired from loving you I care no more  
I don't regret the day we met when love was there  
Now love has gone life lingers on I just don't care  
Love is a thing that is crazy for all no matter who  
I had my love but I lost it all when I lost you  
  
It never should have happened and it won't no more  
(Love is a thing that is crazy for all no matter who)  
I had my love but I lost it all when I lost you  
It never should have happened and it won't no more  
My love has gone my pride has gone I care no more (care no more)

In my dreams an old friend came to see you  
Right from the start he was the stealing kind  
You'll never know how much it hurt me darling  
The night you left his loving on your mind  
I keep dreaming of you all the time  
Then and only then you're really mine  
There's sadness when you go away and I face another day  
Yet I keep dreaming of you all the time  
[ fiddle ]  
Last night again I dreamed we were together  
I held you close the way I used to do  
I kissed your lips and said I found my heaven  
You whispered low how much you love me too  
I keep dreaming of you...  
  
  

Standing in the moonlight by the old garden gate  
Nellie, my darlin', I know you will wait  
Wait for me, dearest, he said in tears  
Then I'll be your sweetheart through all the long years  
I love you Nellie, yes I'll be true  
All these long years have been just for you  
And believe me, Nellie, when I'm far away  
I'll not forget you, I'll be with you someday  
Early next morning at the break of day  
He was to journey so far away  
Drawing her nearer, his promised bride  
By the pale moonlight these words he replied  
I love you Nellie, yes I'll be true  
All these long years have been just for you  
And believe me, Nellie, when I'm far away  
I'll not forget you, I'll be with you someday

One morning as I rambled  
Down by the sea shore  
The wind it did whistle  
And the waters did roar.  
  
I heard a fair maiden  
Make a pitiful sound  
It sounded so lonesome  
In the waters around.  
  
I never will marry  
I'll be no man's wife  
I expect to live single  
All the days of my life.  
  
My love's gone and left me  
The one I adore  
She's gone where  
I'll never see her anymore.  
  
She plunged her fair body  
In the waters so deep  
She closed her pretty blue eyes  
In the waters to sleep.  
  
I never will marry  
I'll be no man's wife  
I expect to live single  
All the days of my life.  
  
The shells in the ocean  
Shall be my death bed  
The fish in deep water  
Swim over my head...

How many arms have held you and hated to let you go  
How many how many I wonder but I really don't want to know  
How many lips have kissed you and set your soul aglow  
How many how many I wonder but I really don't want to know  
So always make me wonder always make me guess  
And even if I ask you darling don't confess  
Just let it remain me your secret but darling I love you so  
No wonder no wonder I wonder no I really don't want to know  
  
So always make me wonder

Last night I dreamed an angel came he took my hand he called my name  
He bade me look the other way I saw a man I heard him say  
He said if I'd be lifted up I'll draw all men to me  
He turned and then I saw the nail scared hands that bled for me  
  
(I touched the hem of his garment that fell round him there)  
My life my heart I gave my soul was in his care  
  
When I awoke my heart beat sore and in the dark I saw a glow  
It was no dream he turned my way again I heard my Saviour say  
He said if I'd be lifted up...

(I see Jesus standing waiting for me)  
Once a man named Steven preached about the Lord  
Folks were saved then folks were healed as they heard his word  
Satan did not like it soon he had his crowd  
And as he was tried they heard Steven cried aloud  
I see Jesus standing at the father's right end I see Jesus over in the
Promised Land  
Work is over now I'm coming to be I see Jesus standing waiting for me  
  
As the stones fell on him beating out his life  
Steven knew he'd soon be through with all toil and strife  
So much like a Master with a heart so true  
He prayed Lord forgive them for they know not what they do  
  
Through the gates of glory down the streets of gold  
March the hero on the Lord into heaven's fold  
When he met the Saviour at the great white throne  
I believed he smiled and said Steven welcome home  
  
I see Jesus...  
(I see you standing waiting for me)

Once I lived a life of wine and roses  
And I drank a lot back then for one concern  
Success for me lay just around the corner  
I thought my social friends would help me make the turn  
But now I'm paying for the days of wine and roses  
A victim of the drunken life I chose  
Now all my social friends look down their noses  
Cause I kept the wine and I threw away the rose  
[ steel ]  
I stood by and watched the bottle take control of me  
The turn I made was not the one I'd planned  
And I watched my social standings slip away from me  
While I watched the bottle slowly take command  
And now I'm paying for...  
Cause I kept the wine and I threw away the rose

Written by Joe Babcock  
Recorded by Hank Snow  
I was born in Macon Georgia they kept my dad in the Macon jail  
Dad said son if you keep your hands clean  
You won't hear them bloodhounds on your trail  
But I fell in with bad companions we robbed a man in Tennessee  
The sheriff caught me way up in Nashville they locked me up and threw away the
key  
I washed my hands in muddy water I washed my hands but they didn't come clean  
I tried to do what daddy told me but I must have washed my hands in a muddy
stream  
I asked the jailor I said when's my time up he said son we won't forget  
And if you try to keep your hands clean we may make a good man of you yet  
I couldn't wait to get my timming I broke out of that Nashville jail  
I just crossed the line of Georgia and I can hear the bloodhounds on my trail  
I washed my hands...  
  
  

I went to your wedding although I was dreading  
The thought of losing you  
The organ was playing my poor heart kept saying  
Your dreams your dreams are through  
  
You came down the aisle wearing a smile a vision of loveliness  
I uttered a sigh then whispered goodbye goodbye to my happiness  
Your mother was crying your father was crying and I was crying too  
The teardrops were falling because we were losing you  
  
Your mother was crying...

Somewhere a telephone is ringing right now  
Someone's old sweetheart is on the line  
She's calling to patch up an old love affair  
Oh I wish it was mine  
Somebody's writing a letter right now  
And saying Lawd oh I was blind  
Somebody's darling longs to come home  
Oh I wish it was mine  
But you never write me and you never phone  
There's somebody else on your mind  
And somebody's heart is glad you don't love me  
Oh I wish it was mine  
[ guitar ]  
But you never write me...  
(Oh I wish it was mine)  
  
  

I wish my heart could talk to you like I do every night  
When we're apart you know it's true I love you every night  
You'd come running back and never leave me feelin' blue  
If my heart (if my heart) could talk (heart could talk)  
To you (heart could talk to you)  
  
Ya know, honey, whenever you're close enough to me  
To reach out and kiss my fingertips  
Then what I'm really feelin' deep down in my heart  
Always fails to leave my lips  
'Cause I plan on all the things that my heart wants to say  
And then I think I'm all set for the next time I see you walk my way  
But it just seems that every time you do I only make a standing start  
And then, darlin, you're gone, yes, you're gone again  
Before these words can ever leave my heart  
  
If my heart could talk to you, you'd never go away  
If my heart could talk to you, forever you would stay  
You'd come running back and never leave me feelin' blue  
If my heart (if my heart) could talk (heart could talk)  
To you (if my heart could talk to you)

Tonight I'm sad, my heart is weary  
I'm wond'ring if I'm wrong or right  
although' you've gone and found another  
I wonder where you are tonight.  
  
[Chorus]  
That old rain is cold and slowly fallin'  
Upon my window pane tonight  
And tho' your love was even colder  
I wonder where you are tonight.  
  
Your heart was cold, you never loved me  
Tho' you said you often cared  
And now you've gone and found another  
Someone who knows the love I shared.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Then came the dawn that day you left me  
I tried to smile with all my might  
But you could see the pain within me  
That lingers in my heart tonight.  
  
[Chorus]

Well the wind blows cold in New York City along about the middle of now  
And I'm telling you I'd be a happy man if I could get away somehow  
Cause I'm growing old before my time finally I see the light  
But if it costs a dime to get around the world I couldn't get out of sight  
But if I ever get back to Georgia there'll be no messin' around  
If I ever get back to Georgia I'm gonna nail my feet to the ground  
[ guitar ]  
Well the buildings here in New York City grow so doggone tall  
Sometimes you can walk for a couple of days and never see the sun at all  
So I left last night I was homeward bound now I wanna sit and I cry  
Cause I stuck out my thumb till my thumb got numb and the cars went right on
by  
But if I ever get back to Georgia...  
[ piano ]  
Well I guess my time in New York City hasn't been a total waste  
Cause I met a little girl from a social world and really put her in her place  
When she sold me half of the Brooklyn Bridge I hung around just for spite  
And I played this part till I won her heart and I bought the other half last
night  
But if I ever get back to Georgia...

If it's wrong to love you wrong I'll alway be  
Though the world may scorn me darling can't you see  
If it's wrong to want you when my day is through  
Gladly I will pay for all my dreams of you  
(Though we met too late dear and you'll never know  
That without a right to I have loved you so)  
I can't change my heart dear you're a part of me  
If it's wrong to love you wrong I'll always be  
Though we met too late dear...  
  
  

We're traveling down two different roads in world so far apart  
You want me yet there's something else before me in your heart  
You're wanting me to change my life the way you're living yours  
But I can't change I see no way you wanted me before  
  
If you don't want me like I am then please don't pity me  
If you can't change a little bit then why not set me free  
If we can't live together then it's best we live apart  
You'll go your way and I'll go mine we'll both make brand new start  
  
There's nothing we can do it seems we'll never get along  
With you believing like you do you say I live so wrong  
But I can't change my way of life I lived it much too long  
You either take me like I am or I'll go on alone  
  
So either say you want my love or take the way you live  
Remember though before you get you got to learn to give  
So if it change my life or go then go it's goin' be  
Cause I can't change my life when you want something more than me

I'm glad I got to see you once again  
Although we're through I still love you  
I guess I'll have to call you just a friend  
'Cause someone new has just stepped in  
I try to say that I don't really miss you  
But in my heart I know it's just a lie  
And if someday his love should prove untrue  
I'll be around when he has said goodbye  
(I try to say that I don't really miss you)  
But in my heart I know it's just a lie  
And if someday his love should prove untrue  
I'll be around when he has said goodbye  
(Goodbye)  

In the days of Noah before the Lord,  
When the wicked had all forgotten God  
Brother Noah, built a boat, which above  
God's wrath did float  
  
And the people saw that they were made of mud  
As the doors swang open and gang plank standing out.  
Noah and his family entered with a shout.  
As the scorners stretched their necks,  
  
Noah stepped out on the deck  
Saying, I'm so glad I'm on the inside looking out.  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh I'd rather be on the inside looking out  
Than to be on the outside looking in  
When the rain began to fall, sinners on the  
Lord did call  
The door was shut and night was setting in.  
Then old Noah from the window looking out  
Gazed to heaven beyond the water spout.  
And he said I thank the Lord that I took Him  
at His word.  
I'm so glad I'm on the inside looking out.  
  
Good old Daniel lived in Babylon long ago  
And he had the grace to tell the devil no.  
Though he prayed three times a day in the  
Good old fashioned way.  
  
They said he, to the lions den must go.  
And lions made him welcomed to their home  
For they knew he was nothing but backbone  
When the king looked in and said, "Are you  
  
Alive or are you dead?"  
He was stirred as Daniel spoke in gentle tones.

That big eight wheeler rollin' down the track  
Means your true lovin' Daddy ain't commin' back  
Because I'm Movin' On  
I'll soon be gone  
You where flying too high for my little old sky  
So I'm Movin' On  
  
That big loud whistle as it blew and blew  
Said hello to the Southland we're commin' to you  
When we're Movin' On  
O' here my song  
You had to laugh at me so I've set you free  
And I'm Movin' On  
  
Mr. Fireman, won't you please listen to me  
Cause I got a pretty Momma in Tennessee  
Keep movin' me on  
Keep rollin' on  
So shovel the coal let this rattle a rollin'  
Keep movin' me on  
  
Mr. Engineer, take that throttle in hand  
This rattle is the fastest in the Southern land  
Keep movin' me on  
Keep rollin' on  
Your gonna ease my mind put me there on time  
And keep rollin' on  
  
I've told you baby from time to time  
But you just wouldn't listen nor pay me no mind  
Now I'm Movin' On  
I'm rollin' on  
You broken your vow and it's all over now  
So I'm Movin' On  
  
You switched your engine  
Now I ain't got time for a trifling woman on my main line  
Because I'm Movin' On  
You done your Daddy wrong  
I warned you twice now you can settle the price  
Because I'm Movin' On  
  
But someday Baby when you've had your play  
Your gonna want your Daddy but your Daddy will say  
Keep movin' on  
You stayed away too long  
I'm through with you too bad your blue  
Keep movin' on

I'm far away from home out on the dashing foam,  
Just how far I have traveled I'll never know,  
Sometimes I feel so blue and I long for home and you,  
But I must stay and fight the foe.  
  
So I'm sending you red roses to tell you my love is true,  
And I send them so you will know dear that I'm always thinking of you.  
Enclosed you will find my heart dear so treat it with tender care  
And every time you look inside dear you'll find my love is there.  
  
May each petal be a memory of the happiness we knew,  
Each thorn may tell a story of the heartache that I've been through,  
So I'm sending you red roses although we're oceans apart,  
And remember when they fade dear that you'll always have my heart.

Though you have refused  
To see me, my dear  
You'd rather I'd be all alone  
Still I can't forget  
The kisses we knew  
And the days  
When I called you my own  
But you found another  
And you loved him too  
My heart is broken  
I'm sad and I'm blue  
I am sorry we met  
It's so hard to forget  
The days that used to be  
  
But you found another...  
And though you weren't true  
I still think of you  
And your memory's so dear to me  
But you found another...

Invisible hands are waiting to guide you

I have sailed across the waters salty ocean deep and blue  
Felt the rapture of the dawning thrilled through sunset golden view  
I have sought above the mountain peeks or valleys great and wide  
But it's a little more like heaven by your side  
  
It's a little more like heaven where you are  
I have sought for happiness both near and far  
But my search for love was through the day that I met you  
'Cause it's a little more like heaven where you are  
  
I have watched the crystal raindrops fall to earth to cool the day  
Watched the rainbow at twilight when the clouds have blown away  
I've adored the clinging roses round my mountain home so dear  
But it's a little more like heaven where you're near  
It's a little more like heaven...  
  
I have tempted for a moment by a lure and magic charms  
Of fickle flame and beauty while waltzin' in her arms  
I cherished mem'ries of the past of friends so kind and true  
But it's a little more like heaven dear with you  
It's a little more like heaven...  
('Cause it's a little more like heaven where you are)

It's been so long, darlin'  
Since I had to go away  
It's been so long, darlin'  
And I'll ne'er forget that day  
  
Although you never mentioned it  
You cried that whole day long  
It's been so long, darlin'  
But now I'm comin' home  
  
[Chorus]  
It's been so long, darlin'  
Since I gazed into your eyes  
It's been so long, darlin'  
Do you really realize  
That the thought of seein' you  
It scares me through and through  
It's been so long, darlin'  
Since I had a kiss from you.  
  
It's been so long, darlin'  
But it won't be long now  
It's been so long, darlin'  
But I've kept ev'ry vow  
  
I pray that you'll be waiting  
As you did in days gone by  
It's been so long, darlin'  
Please don't blame me if I cry.  
  
[Chorus]

When I think of the dreams I've let slip through my hands  
And the years that I've wasted Lord I've cried from my shame  
But when I feel the glow of your love then I know  
That I've done at least one thing that was good in my life.  
  
Yes, I've done at least one thing that was good in my life  
And with you I have one dream that will live through the night  
And each day I will know as I watch our love grow  
That I've done at least one thing that was good in my life.  
  
When I think of the dreams I've let slip through my hands

But then when I feel the glow of your sweet love then I know  
That I've done at least one thing that was good in my life.  
  
Yes, I've done at least one thing that was good in my life  
And with you I have one dream that will live through the night  
And each day I will know as I watch our love grow  
That I've done at least one thing that was good in my life...

Down the way where the nights are gay and the sun shines daily on the mountain
top  
  
I took a trip on a sailing ship and when I reached Jamaica I made a stop  
  
But I'm sad to say I'm on my way won't be back for many a day  
  
My heart is down my head is turnin' around I had to leave a little girl in
Kingston town  
  
[ ac. Guitar ]  
  
Sounds of laughter everywhere and the dancing girls swayin' to and fro  
  
I must declare my heart is there although I've been from Maine to Mexico  
  
But I'm sad to say...  
  
[ ac. Guitar ]  
  
Down at the market you can hear ladies cry out while on their heads they bear  
  
Ackey rice salt fish are nice and the sun is fine anytime of the year  
  
But I'm sad to say...

I'm a Lady's Man, Oh! yes-sir-ee  
I like the gals and the gals like me  
Can I make 'em swoon? Oh! yes, I can  
Don't know what it is about me they love  
But what it is, I got plenty of  
Make way for me, I'm a lovin', Lady's Man.  
  
I'm a Lady's Man and that's no crime  
I like 'em 'round me all of the time  
I've got a line of talk they understand  
Now you may like a baseball game  
But as for me, that's much too tame  
I get my thrill just bein' a Lady's Man.  
  
Been a Lady's Man since I was three  
The women used to bounce me on their knee  
They would always say, "When he grows up, watch out!"  
"When the gals see his big blue eyes  
They'll hang around like a bunch of flies."  
Those women knew what they were talkin' about.  
  
I'm a Lady's Man I get the breaks  
I guess I've got everything it takes  
When it come to lovin', they like my brand  
Oh! the gals won't leave me alone  
I have to disconnect my phone  
That's how it is when you're a Lady's Man.  
  
I'm a Lady's Man, Oh! yes-sir-ee  
I love the gals and the gals love me  
And when it comes to dates, I'm in demand  
Oh! I like 'em short, I like 'em tall  
As a mater of fact, I love 'em all  
Make way for me, I'm a lovin', Lady's Man

Long as there is chicken gravy on your rice,  
Ev'rything is nice.  
Long as there's watermelon on the vine,  
Ev'rything is fine.  
  
You got no time to work,  
You got no time to play,  
Busy doin' nothin' all the live long day.  
You won't ever change no matter what I say,  
You're just made that way.  
  
Lazybones, sleepin' in the sun,  
How you 'spec' to get your day's work done?  
Sleepin' in the noonday sun.  
Lazybones, sleepin' in the shade,  
  
How you 'spec' to get your corn meal made?  
Never get your corn meal made  
Sleepin' in the evenin' shade.  
  
When 'taters need sprayin',  
I bet you keep prayin'  
The bugs fall off the vine  
And when you fo fishin'  
I bet you keep wishin'  
The fish won't grab at your line.  
  
Lazybones, loafin' through the day,  
Now you 'spec' to make a dime that way?  
Never make a dime that way  
(Well looky here)  
He never heard a word I say!

On a quiet summer day long ago and far away  
Two tiny tots their game of play did end,  
As they gazed into the sky where the lazy clouds go by,  
The little girl said let's just play pretend.  
  
[Chorus]  
Let's pretend those clouds are islands in the sky,  
And let's pretend that we?re up there just you and I,  
Let's pretend that no one knew where to find us in the blue,  
Let's pretend our dreams come true as years go by.  
  
Now today as long years fly  
Do they wander side by side,  
And do their dreams into the future wind,  
Do they still recall the day when she turned to him to say,  
Darling take my hand and let's pretend.  
  
[Chorus]  
Let's pretend those clouds are islands in the sky,  
And let's pretend that we're up there just you and I,  
Let's pretend that no one knew where to find us in the blue,  
Let's pretend our dreams come true as years go by.

I was standing by the window yesterday morning,  
Without a thought of worry or of care,  
When I saw the postman coming up the pathway,  
With such a happy look and jolly air.  
  
[Chorus]  
As I heard the postman whistling yester morning,  
Coming down the pathway with his pack,  
Oh he little knew the sorrow that he brought me  
When he handed me that letter edged in black.  
  
Oh, he rang the bell and whistled while he waited,  
And then he said "Good morning to you, Jack."  
But he little knew the sorrow that he brought me  
When he handed me that letter edged in black.  
  
With trembling hand I took the letter from him,  
I broke the seal and this is what it said:  
"Come home, my boy, your dear old father wants you!  
Come home, my boy, your dear old mother's dead!"  
  
"The last words that your mother ever uttered  
'Tell my boy I want him to come back,'  
My eyes are blurred, my poor old heart is breaking,  
For I'm writing you this letter edged in black."  
  
I bow my head in sorrow and in silence,  
The sunshine of my life it all has fled,  
Since the postman brought that letter yester morning  
Saying,"Come home, my boy, your dear old mother's dead!:"  
  
"Those angry words, I wish I'd never spoken,  
You know I never meant them, don't you, Jack?  
May the angels bear me witness, I am asking  
Your forgiveness in this letter edged in black."

You look so pretty lying there with dreamland's smile upon your face  
Your golden curls in disarray upon your starched white pillow case  
The soft blue satin covers pulled up tight around your lovely throat  
It almost makes me want to go destroy the message on the note.  
  
The note I left upon your perfumed stationary by the phone  
I hate to think about you waking up at dawn to find me gone  
It hurts me so to get up in the middle of the night and go  
But thinking back I do remember faintly that I told you so.  
  
I told you I was like a bird, a free and wild and restless thing  
And even though I take a mate and build a nest in early spring  
When summer winds have had their day and winter clouds are flying high  
Instinctively I spread my wings and fly.  
  
I only know that I must go and nothing here must hold me back  
I like the love you gave me and the tender way you scratched my back  
I like your warm sweet kisses and the way you cook your ham and eggs  
I like the way the suntan lotion softened up your lovely legs.  
  
I like the static noise I heard when you would sit and brush your hair  
The way you gave yourself to me and never asked to go nowhere  
But most of all I like the way you always smiled and never frowned  
The way you took this chance for love and took me just for what I am.  
  
I told you I was like a bird, a free and wild and restless thing  
And even though I take a mate and build a nest in early spring  
When summer winds have had their day and winter clouds are flying high  
Instinctively I spread my wings and fly.  
  
And now my darling as I leave I fight the yearning in my blood  
To wake you up and love you just once more before I go for good  
But somehow I am fighting back my passion for I cannot stay  
And someday you'll look back and know the best it ended up this way.  
  
I told you I was like a bird, a free and wild and restless thing  
And even though I take a mate and build a nest in early spring  
When summer winds have had their day and winter clouds are flying high  
Instinctively I spread my wings and fly.  
  
I fly, I fly, I fly...

Would you like to hear the story of  
A girl that many soldiers know  
It's a tale of love and all its glory  
They tell when the lights are soft and low  
Underneath the lamp post by the barrack's gate  
Standing all alone every night you see her wait  
She waits for the boy who marched away  
And though he's gone she hears him say  
"Oh promise you'll be true fare thee well Lili Marlene till I'll return to you  
Fare thee well Lili Marlene"  
With the kiss she gave her promise  
To be constant as the stars up above  
Every soldier knows she kept her promise  
And she has been faithful to her love  
(Underneath the lamp post by the barrack's gate  
Standing all alone every night you see her wait  
For this is the place a vow was made and breezes sing her serenade)  
Oh promise you'll be true fare Thee well Lily Marlene till I'll return to you  
Fare Thee well Lily Marlene  
  
Although each tale must have an ending  
No one knows just what the end will be  
But tonight when twilight is descending  
If you'll come along here's what you'll see  
Underneath the lamp post by the barrack's gate  
Standing all alone every night you see her wait  
And as they go marching to the prey  
The soldiers all salute and say  
"We'll tell him you've been true.  
Fare thee well Lili Marlene till he returns to you  
Fare thee well Lili Marlene"

Linda Lou, honest true,  
I'm just wild about your lovely eyes of blue,  
For your smile, I'd walk miles,  
For my honey child I'm glad to be with you,  
  
As long as you are by my side I have no cause to pine,  
I point you out with so much pride,  
And tell the world you're mine,  
Linda Lou, honest true,  
I'm in love with you alone sweet Linda Lou.  
  
I've waited a long time for you darlin',  
But never knew exactly what you'd be,  
Now that you have come to me my darlin',  
You're a wee bit of heaven to me  
  
Linda Lou, honest true,  
You're the first in every thought I have today,  
You're so sweet, and so neat,  
That I thank the LORD for sending you my way,  
  
Some day you'll know the way I feel deep down within your heart,  
To be with you when shadows steal and know we'll never part,  
Linda Lou, honest true,  
I'm in love with you alone sweet Linda Lou.

I don't know much on religion and I ain't never had no show  
But I got a middlin' tight grip sir on the handful of things that I know  
I don't pan out on the prophets good will and that sort of thing  
But I believe in God and the angels ever since one night last spring.  
  
I come into town with some turnips and my little Gabe came along  
No four year old in this country could beat him for purty and strong  
Pert and chipper and sassy and always ready to swear and fight  
And I learned him to chaw tobaccy just to keep his teeth milk white.  
  
The snow came down like a blanket as I passed by Taget's store  
I went in for a jug of molasses and I left the team at the door  
But they scared at somethin' and started and I heard one little squeal  
And lickety split over the prairie went team Little Britches and all.  
  
Yes lickety split over the prairie I was almost froze with skeer  
But we rousted up some torches and we searched from far and near  
At last we struck hosses and wagon snowed under a soft white mound  
Upsot dead beat but of little Gabe no hide nor hair could be found.  
  
And here all hope soured on me of findin' my little Gabe  
So I just flopped down on my marrow bones  
And crotched deep in the snow and prayed  
By this time the torches was played out and me and Israel Par  
Went off with some wood to a sheep fold that he said was somewhere thar.  
  
We found it at last in a little she'd where they shut up the lambs at night  
We looked in and seen them huddled there so warm and sleepy and white  
And there sot Little Britches and chirped as pert as ever you see  
I wants a chaw of tobaccy and that's what's the matter of me.  
  
How did he get there angels he could never have walked in that storm  
They just scooped down and toted him to where it was safe and warm  
And I think that savin a little child and fodging him to his own  
Is a dern sight better business than loafin' around the throne...

Broken hearted and so sad, golden curls all wet with tears,  
'Twas a picture of sorrow to see.  
Kneeling close to the side of his pal and only pride,  
A little lad these words he told me.  
  
He was such a lovely doggie and to me he was such fun,  
but today as we played by the way  
A drunken man got mad at him because he barked in joy,  
He beat him and he's dying here today.  
  
Will you call the doctor please and tell him if he comes right now,  
he'll save my precious doggie 'cause I'll pray.  
Then he stroked the fluffy head but his little pal was dead,  
Just a shiver and he slowly passed away.  
  
He didn't know his dog had died, so I told him as he cried  
"Come with me son we'll get that doctor right away"  
"But I can't leave him here alone, I must get my doggie home  
So while you're gone I'll kneel beside him, sir and I'll pray."  
  
But when I returned he had his little pal upon his knee  
And the teardrops they were blinding his big blue eyes,  
"You're too late, sir my doggie's dead and no help can save him now  
But I'll meet my precious Buddy up in the sky."  
  
By a tiny narrow grave, where the willows sadly wave,  
are these words on a shingle of pine:  
"Little Buddy rest in peace, God will watch you through' the years,  
Cause I told Him in my prayers that you were mine."

We're living in a worried world  
A world that's full of fears  
But there's one hopeful peace eternal  
I hope that it's very near.  
  
Little children are the hope of the world  
So guide them day and night be sure you teach them right  
You can teach them by the things you do and say  
The way you live today the way you pray.  
  
Suffer the little children to come unto me  
For such is the kingdom of heaven God made it plain to see  
Little children are the hope of the world  
Se help us teach them Lord to walk with Thee.  
  
(Suffer the little children to come unto me  
Such is the kingdom of heaven God made it plain to see)  
Little children are the hope of the world  
Se help us teach them Lord to walk with Thee...

Little stranger in a manger little stranger sweet and mild  
Mother Mary daddy Joseph watch o'er you their holy child  
Searching for you to adore you come Three Kings led by a star  
Little stranger in a manger they'll find heaven where you are  
Choir of angels are singing this night of your birth  
Praise and glory to the highest in a stable on earth  
Humble shepherds filled will wonder kneel and pray by lanthern light  
Little stranger in a manger bless our soul this holy night  
Choir of angels are singing this night of your birth  
Praise and glory to the highest little stranger here on earth  
Humble shepherds filled will wonder...  
(Little stranger here on earth)

The first thing I remember knowin' was a lonesome whistle blowin'  
And the youngest dream of growin' up to ride  
On a freight train leavin' town not knowin' where I'm bound  
No one could change my mind but mama tried  
One and only rebel child for my family meek and mild  
My mama seemed to know what lay in store  
Spite of all my Sunday learnin' toward the bad I kept on turnin'  
Till mama couldn't hold me anymore  
And I turned twenty one in prison doing life without parole  
No one could steer me right but mama tried mama tried  
Mama tried to raise me better but her pleadings I denied  
That leaves only me to blame cause mama tried  
  
Dear old daddy rest his soul left my mama heavy load  
She tried so very hard to fill his shoes  
Working hours without rest wanted me to have the best  
She tried to raise me right but I refused  
And I turned twenty one in prison...  
That leaves only me to blame cause mama tried

Tonight down here in the valley I'm lonesome and oh how I feel  
As I sit here alone in my cabin I can see your mansion on the hill  
Do you recall when we parted the story to me you revealed  
You said you could live without love dear in your loveless mansion on the hill  
(The light shines bright from your window the trees stand so silent and still)  
I know you're alone with your pride dear in your loveless mansion on the hill

This is divorce think it over my friend.

Do you take this woman to be your dear wife  
Do you vow to love her the rest of your life  
And will you protect her and honor her name  
Oh don't cause her heartaches and don't bring her shame  
Share with her in poverty with her in wealth  
For richer for poorer through sickness and health  
All these things the Parson did ask me and then I whispered I do and I'd do it
again  
  
For I really love her the one I call wife and I'll go on caring the rest of my
life  
I'd die to protect her and she'd do the same  
I'd cut off my tongue before I'd bring her shame  
We may be in poverty may not have wealth  
But we stick together through sickness and health  
I'll always be thankful till my life is done that two little words made us
both into one

Moanin' my life slowly away  
Sittin' here waitin' for the new commin' day  
They try to cheer me as I trudge on my way  
Moanin' for you  
  
Can't seem to hide it and why should I try  
Good Lord, he knows it up there in the sky  
A million heartaches with your last goodbye  
Left me moanin' for you  
  
Work these poor fingers way down to the bone  
When things seemed right my whole world went wrong  
Then I found your letter, baby, sayin' so long  
I've been moanin' for you  
  
They find me alone at the close of the day  
Countin' each petal from your rose bouquet  
Guess I'll be here till eternity  
Moanin' for you  
  
This ole rockin' chair, I have rocked it apart  
The last spark of flame in my fireplace is dark  
But this old flame that's burnin' deep down in my heart  
Keeps me moanin' for you  
  
Work these poor fingers way down to the bone  
When things seemed right my whole world went wrong  
Then I found your letter, baby, sayin' so long  
I've been moanin' for you
