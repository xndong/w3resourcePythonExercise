We both went a little crazy  
We both did each other wrong  
Don't think it's too late baby  
Don't think that all hope is gone  
  
[Chorus]  
We need a little more love  
To get us through the night  
Just a little more love  
And we'll be all right  
  
It'd be easy to say it doesn't matter  
To walk away and wish you the best  
But I know we'd feel a whole lot better  
If we tried a little tenderness  
  
Let's put our differences aside  
We can make it baby you and I  
Let's give it just one more try  
We can't let this thing die

A good woman's love is like a river  
Runnin' through the heart of a man  
If he gives her all he can give her  
She'll be with him at every bend  
  
And now the rivers I've crossed  
A reflection was lost  
And shallow waters left me blue  
Girl, I never came across a river like you  
  
A river like you  
Where your love runs so deep and true  
A river like you  
Like a waterfall fallin' in two  
A river like you  
  
Well, I spent all my time searchin'  
And runnin' like the wayward wind  
But you found me desperately driftin'  
And touched my heart and took me in  
  
Now your love runs through me  
And in your eyes I see  
Reflections I never knew  
Girl, I'll always be sailin' on a river like you  
  
A river like you  
Where your love runs so deep and true  
A river like you  
Like a waterfall fallin' in two  
A river like you  
  
Now the rivers I've crossed  
A reflection was lost  
And shallow waters left me blue  
Girl, I'll always keep sailin' on a river like you  
  
A river like you  
Where your love runs so deep and true  
A river like you  
Like a waterfall fallin' in two  
A river like you  
A river like you  
A river like you

I take it out on you  
I take it out on me  
Don't take to a cruel world  
Very gracefully  
I'm the cause and effect  
Of my own four-letter words  
Baby, I'm a good man  
No matter what you heard  
And I'll be there for you  
When you need me to be  
I'll be the sun at your door  
I'll be the wind in your trees  
If I've nothin' at all on the surface to see  
I'll be the ace up your pretty sleeve  
Oh yes, I will  
I'm sharp with my tongue  
I know I cut you inside  
But I make a concerted  
Effort at times  
To try to be more  
Than a fool in your eyes  
Baby, I love you  
Don't you realize?  
That I'll be there for you  
When you need me to be  
I'll be the sun at your door  
I'll be the wind in your trees  
If I've nothin' at all on the surface to see  
I'll be the ace up your pretty sleeve  
Oh, up your pretty sleeve, baby  
And I'll be there for you  
When you need me to be  
I'll be the sun at your door  
I'll be the wind in your trees  
If I've nothin' at all on the surface to see  
I'll be the ace up your pretty sleeve  
And if I've nothin' at all on the surface to see  
I'll be the ace up your pretty sleeve  
Oh yes, I will  
An ace up your pretty sleeve  

I took chance, I took a fall  
Waited on love 'til I could give it my all  
Then I let my heart fly  
  
Took a rose to her door  
Stood there like a statue just sort of frozen by her presence  
But I shied  
  
[Chorus]  
Ain't it always that way  
When you want to believe  
Ain't it always that way  
When you want and you need  
Ain't it always that way  
When you want to rely  
Ain't it always that way  
When you want and you need and you cry  
  
Yes and then I took a space out of time  
I don't wanna sound like a thief but the moment was mine  
And I stole it, it felt right  
  
I took a chance, took a fall  
Waited on love until I could give it my all  
Then I let my heart fly  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ain't it always that way  
When you want to believe  
Ain't it always that way  
When you want and you need and you cry

I'm all prayed up, I'm ready to meet my Savior  
Eternal life is waitin' in the by and by  
I'm all prayed up, my faith will never waiver  
Heaven's doors gonna swing wide open when I die  
I made my peace with Jesus a long, long time ago  
Trusted in Him that He would save my soul  
I walked up there beside Him, He guides me me on my way  
And I know He hears me when I kneel and pray  
I'm all prayed up, I'm ready to meet my Savior  
Eternal life is waitin' in the by and by  
I'm all prayed up, my faith will never waiver  
Heaven's doors gonna swing wide open when I die  
Now I ain't afraid of Satan, his wicked ways of sin  
They tempted me but he couldn't pull me in  
When I've gone to live with Jesus, face my judgment day  
He'll fulfill for me the promise that He made  
I'm all prayed up, I'm ready to meet my Savior  
Eternal life is waitin' in the by and by  
I'm all prayed up, my faith will never waiver  
Heaven's doors gonna swing wide open when I die  
I'm all prayed up, I'm ready to meet my Savior  
Eternal life is waitin' in the by and by  
I'm all prayed up, my faith will never waiver  
Heaven's doors gonna swing wide open when I die  
I'm all prayed up, my faith will never waiver  
Heaven's doors gonna swing wide open when I die  

Come on in and take your coat off  
Come on in and sit down  
If I seem a little nervous  
I've been walkin' shaky ground  
  
I've been alone since she left me  
And I'm not quite sure what to do  
So if I call her name I'm sorry  
It's all those years are hard to lose  
  
[Chorus]  
All those years with just one woman  
Was all gone in just a day  
All those years with just one woman  
Makes it hard to try to find a brand new way  
After all those years  
  
I guess I should take down her picture  
And try to put your mind at ease  
And tell myself it's really over  
And put aside this misery  
  
[Chorus]

He was sitting in the corner  
At a table all alone  
A candle burnin' in the darkness  
His glass of wine was almost gone  
And something about him felt familiar  
And it made me stop and stare  
The way he held his hands before him  
Looked like he was lost in prayer  
Hey son, what are you lookin' at?  
Why do your eyes look so sad?  
There's somethin' in the way he sat there  
It made me think about my dad  
I'm lookin' for the answer  
Just like everyone  
I know that there's no ending  
To the love between a father and the son  
Hey son, why don't you pull up one of those empty chairs?  
Bring it over here by my side  
Buy me a glass of wine  
This looks like a real good place to hide  
You know I've always been a fisherman  
Fishin' for souls along the way  
You kind of remind me of my only son  
And I lost him 33 years ago today  
I'm lookin' for the answer  
Just like everyone  
I know that there's no ending  
To the love between a father and the son  
There's somethin' I must give you  
The compass that my father made  
It'll point you in the right direction  
In case you ever lose your way  
You know I've got somethin' here in my pocket  
This is little silver cross  
I think my son would want you to have it  
When you think all the hope is lost  
We're lookin' for the answer  
Just like everyone  
We know that there's no ending  
To the love between a father and the son  
I left him sitting at his table  
But I didn't feel alone  
For a moment I could see the light  
Oh, we were almost home  
For a moment I could see the light  
Oh, we were almost home  

It feels like you're at the bottom of an avalanche  
You sit and cry 'cause he don't ever wanna dance  
Give me the dice, give me half a chance with you, baby  
I look for you, just hoping you'll come in tonight  
With that fool, the one who never treats you right  
If you only knew how bad I burn inside for you, baby  
Baby, I'll do just what I have to do  
I'd beg, borrow, steal, cheat and lie for you  
I'll put it all on the line if you ask me to  
I'll bet it all on you  
(Bet it all on you)  
Every dime  
(I'll bet it all on you)  
Every time  
(I'll bet it all on you)  
I'll bet it all, babe  
(I'll bet it all on you)  
I think it's time for me to finally show my hand  
This heart of mine has taken all that it can stand  
But I ain't blind, I can see you want me too, baby  
Come on, let's make a run for the parking lot  
Can't wait, gotta give this thing a shot  
I know it's crazy but we ain't got a thing to lose  
Baby, I'll do just what I have to do  
I'd beg, borrow, steal, cheat and lie for you  
I'll put it all on the line if you ask me to  
Oh, babe, I'll bet it all on you  
(Bet it all on you)  
Every dime  
(I'll bet it all on you)  
Every time  
(I'll bet it all on you)  
I'll bet it all on you, babe  
(I'll bet it all on you)  
I'll bet it all on you, girl  
Baby, I'll do just what I have to do  
Beg, borrow, steal, cheat and lie for you  
I'll put it all on the line if you ask me to  
I'll bet it all on you  
(I bet it all on you)  
Every dime  
(I'll bet it all on you)  
Every time  
(I'll bet it all on you)  
I'll bet it all on you  
(I'll bet it all on you)  
Oh, I'll bet it all on you, babe  
(I'll bet it all on you)  
Every time  
(I'll bet it all on you)  
Every time  
I'll bet it all on you  
I'll bet it all on you  
I'll bet it all on you  
I'll bet it all on you  
I'll bet it all on you  
I'll bet it all on you  
I'll bet it all on you  
I'll bet it all on you  

I'll have a blue Christmas without you  
I'll be so blue thinking about you  
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree  
Won't mean a thing if you're not here with me  
  
I'll have a blue Christmas, that's certain  
And when that blue heartache starts hurtin'  
You'll be doin' all right with your Christmas of white  
But I'll have a blue, blue Christmas  
  
I'll have a blue Christmas without you  
I'll be so blue thinking about you  
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree  
Won't mean a thing if you're not here with me  
  
I'll have a blue Christmas, that's certain  
And when that blue heartache starts hurtin'  
You'll be doin' all right with your Christmas of white  
But I'll have a blue, blue Christmas

Say you're sorry  
You still care  
She came by my place again  
Cryin' about you man  
You should love her  
Twice as much  
I try to remember you're a friend  
But it's gettin' a little rough  
  
She's just tired  
Of bein' Cinderella  
She can't live that way no more  
She needs a little affection  
A little understanding  
You better be careful 'Cause the next time she comes to my door  
She won't be a Cinderella no more  
  
A teardrop trembled  
On her face  
Where that smile always was  
It seemed out of place  
And when I held her  
Like a friend  
I could feel a sweet beginning  
But taste a bitter end  
  
She's just tired  
Of bein' Cinderella  
She can't live that way no more  
She needs a little affection  
A little understanding  
You better be careful 'Cause the next time she comes to my door  
You'll be sorry  
  
'Cause it seems like  
It's always something with you  
And everybody's always wrong  
One of these nights  
You'll reach for the pillow she sleeps on  
And she's gonna be gone  
  
She's just tired  
Of bein' Cinderella  
She can't live that way no more  
She needs a little affection  
A little understanding  
You better be careful 'Cause the next time she comes to my door  
You'll be sorry

Oh, I woke up this morning  
A long before the dawn  
I stumbled to the kitchen  
And put some coffee on  
The house was deathly quiet  
I knew something was wrong  
Then suddenly it dawned on me  
The cold gray light of gone  
No, there's nothin' quite as lonely  
As the cold gray light of gone  
When waking up and findin' out  
She's never comin' home  
And the note that said it's over  
Lord, it chills me to the bone  
No, there's nothin' quite as lonely  
As the cold gray light of gone  
Oh, I sat and cried for hours  
And I tried to clear my head  
I even went and laid back down  
On her side of the bed  
Her perfume lingered on the sheets  
Our love once laid upon  
Her memory's destroying me  
In the cold gray light of gone  
No, there's nothin' quite as lonely  
As the cold gray light of gone  
When waking up and findin' out  
She's never comin' home  
And the note that said it's over  
Lord, it chills me to the bone  
No, there's nothin' quite as lonely  
As the cold gray light of gone  
No, there's nothin' quite as lonely  
As the cold gray light of gone  
When waking up and findin' out  
She's never comin' home  
And the note that said it's over  
Lord, it chills me to the bone  
No, there's nothin' quite as lonely  
As the cold gray light of gone  
No, there's nothin' quite as lonely  
As the cold gray light of gone  

It's colder than winter  
Right here in my heart  
Lord I'm gonna miss her  
She's torn me apart  
  
I couldn't make you love me  
I couldn't give any more  
It's colder than winter  
Since you closed the door  
  
It's colder than winter  
I'm freezing inside  
And my tears won't be bitter  
Even though our love died  
  
I couldn't make you love me  
I couldn't give any more  
It's colder than winter  
Since you closed the door  
  
Every time the sun sets  
I shed another tear  
And the lonelier I get  
Wishing you were still here  
  
I couldn't make you love me  
I couldn't give any more  
It's colder than winter  
Since you closed the door

I'm puttin' on my favorite cowboy boots  
Like a crazy bull rider comin' out of the chute  
I'm ready for some dancin', maybe too much beer  
Little bare-back rubbin's goin' on in here  
Hey little cowgirl, leave the Stetson on  
Let's cowboy up and down, honey, all night long  
She said her name was Levitra Marcantonio  
I'm a bare back rider, okie, don't you know?  
These frozen margaritas are goin' to my head  
I could not believe it when Levitra said  
?Hey Mr. Cowboy, come on and take me home  
Gonna cowboy up and down, honey, all night long?  
All night long, oh, you're comin' on strong  
All night long, come on and do me wrong, do me wrong, baby  
Hey little cowgirl, leave just your Stetson on  
Gonna cowboy up and down, honey, all night long  
Hey little cowgirl, leave just your Stetson on  
Gonna cowboy up and down till Levitra's gone  

Do you hear what I hear  
Do you hear what I hear  
  
Said the night wind to the little lamb,  
Do you see what I see  
Way up in the sky, little lamb,  
Do you see what I see  
A star, a star, dancing in the night  
With a tail as big as a kite  
With a tail as big as a kite  
  
Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy,  
Do you hear what I hear  
Ringing through the sky, shepherd boy,  
Do you hear what I hear  
A song, a song, high above the trees  
With a voice as big as the sea  
With a voice as big as the sea  
  
Everyone, come together  
Pray together, stay together  
Celebrate the coming other king  
All my sisters, all my brothers  
Come together, love one another  
Join me now, every voice and sing  
Do You Hear What I Hear?  
(Traditional Christmas)  
  
Said the shepherd boy to the mighty king,  
Do you know what I know  
In your palace warm, mighty king,  
Do you know what I know  
A Child, a child shivers in the cold  
Let us bring him silver and gold  
Let us bring him silver and gold  
The Child, the Child, sleeping in the night  
He will bring us goodness and light  
He will bring us goodness and light  
  
Everybody, come together  
Pray together, stay together  
Everybody, come together  
Stay together, celebrate together  
Everybody, come together  
Pray together, stay together  
Everybody, come together  
Stay together, celebrate together

Don't come cryin' to me when it's over  
Don't you come knockin'' at my door  
Don't come cryin' to me I won't be waiting  
Like I've done a hundred times before  
  
You promised you'd love me forever  
Now it's all over town you've changed your mind  
You'll call me and say "let's get together"  
But I'm sorry I won't take you back this time  
  
Don't come cryin' to me when it's over  
Don't you come knockin'' at my door  
Don't come cryin' to me I won't be waiting  
Like I've done a hundred times before  
  
Like I've done a hundred times before

We've been up  
All night long  
Trying to solve a problem  
Hell it's almost dawn  
Ain't no time for sleepin'  
If our love is wearin' thin  
'Cause I ain't givin' up  
And you ain't givin' in  
  
Don't let our love start slippin'  
Love start slippin' away  
'Cause the life we've been livin'  
Gets harder everyday  
Don't let our love start slippin'  
Love start slippin' away  
  
A wounded love  
Walks a real thin line  
And no communication  
Will kill it every time  
So open up your heart  
Baby we can work it out  
'Cause we've got the kind of love  
People dream about  
  
Don't let our love start slippin'  
Love start slippin' away  
'Cause the life we've been livin'  
Gets harder everyday  
Don't let our love start slippin'  
Love start slippin' away  
  
It's past the point of right or wrong  
Let's find a way to just hold on

They say you'll lie, they say you'll cheat  
And your kisses taste so sweet  
If you're not in love then let me be  
No baby, don't pretend with me  
  
That honky-tonking life you lead  
With neon lights you'll never leave  
Give me one reason to believe  
But baby, don't pretend with me  
  
Your foolish heart will never change  
Well, I want no part of your love-sick games  
I know you're wild and runnin' free  
So baby, don't pretend with me  
  
I'll lay my poor heart at your feet  
If you'll leave behind those lonely streets  
Oh, we could make sweet memories  
So baby, don't pretend with me  
  
Your foolish heart will never change  
I want no part of your love-sick games  
I know you're wild and runnin' free  
So baby, don't pretend with me  
I know you're wild and runnin' free  
So baby, don't pretend with me

I'm gonna tell you right up front  
So you will understand  
I ain't gonna waste your time  
'Cause I might not be your man  
We won't go makin' promises  
'Cause you know it just ain't right  
A promise is a promise, girl  
And tonight is just tonight  
Tonight is just tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't say that you love me  
If it don't feel right  
Don't say that you love me  
Just hold me tonight  
  
There ain't no need for broken hearts  
I know in time they mend  
Any fool can fall in love  
It's so easy to pretend  
Don't tell me I'm the only one  
If it doesn't mean a thing  
Let's take tonight for what it's worth  
And see what tomorrow brings  
And see what tomorrow brings  
  
[Chorus]

Hey Creole Darlin'  
Talk that French to me  
You know your love is somethin'  
Like I ain't never seen  
I'm goin' down, down, down, down to New Orleans  
  
Your eyes shine line diamonds  
And those kisses sure make me scream  
There ain't nothin' like love on the bayou  
Honey I know you know what I mean  
I'm goin' down, down, down, down to New Orleans  
I'm goin' down, down, down, down to New Orleans  
  
They got the gumbo and the Creole  
They got the Quarter all night long  
I got my Delta Queen that makes my heart sing  
Man I ain't never goin' home  
I'm goin' down, down, down, down to New Orleans

When I told my baby  
Do what you wanna do  
Well I had no idea  
Just what she'd put me through  
  
Every night she's runnin' 'round  
Singin' songs in your hometown  
There ain't no one to love me  
When the sun goes down  
  
[Chorus]  
Well, she's everybody's sweetheart  
Everybody's sweetheart but mine  
I shoulda kept her barefoot  
Barefoot and pregnant all the time  
I used to be the first in line  
Now I've fallen way behind  
She's everybody's sweetheart  
Everybody's sweetheart but mine  
  
All that country club money  
Lord it sure looked good to me, yeah it did  
Playin' golf with those fat cats  
How much better could life be  
They all think I've got it made  
They see your face on every page  
Of every magazine  
Across the USA  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If you see her tell her hi  
And everything will be all right  
Tell her that I love her  
'Til the day I die  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Come on home

It's like jail, it's like flight  
It's a dream that breaks in the middle of the night  
It's like chains, it's like an open door  
Love is everything and nothing I've been looking for  
It's coming home, it's lost at sea  
It's a hopeless addiction to sweet misery  
It's the poison, it's the candy store  
Well, love is everything and nothing I've been looking for  
I can't hide from the truth, this love I feel for you  
Oh, it's the one thing that I can't ignore  
I know I can't explain the pleasure or the pain  
Your love is everything and nothing I've been looking for  
It's like freedom, it's like a trap  
It's a short trip to Heaven and a long ride back  
Well, dance on the ceiling and crawl on the floor  
And love is everything and nothing I've been looking for  
I can't hide from the truth, this love I feel for you  
Oh, it's the one thing that I can't ignore  
I know I can't explain the pleasure or the pain  
Your love is everything and nothing I've been looking for  
I can't hide from the truth, this love I feel for you  
Oh, it's the one thing that I can't ignore  
I know I can't explain the pleasure or the pain  
Your love is everything and nothing I've been looking for  
Well, love is everything and nothing I've been looking for  

Love ain't for the faint of heart  
Timid and the weak  
Pour me one more on the rocks  
And baby, we'll just see  
  
We'll start a fire, you pour the wine  
Slip on in to these arms of mine  
  
Love ain't for the faint of heart  
Love's for you and me  
  
Ooh, what a rush when you kiss me that way  
Ooh, your touch is gonna drive me crazy  
Ooh, what a night this has been  
Baby, let's do it again  
  
Love ain't for the faint of heart  
Love's for you and me  
  
Ooh, what a rush when you kiss me that way  
Ooh, your touch is gonna drive me crazy  
Ooh, what a night this has been  
Baby, let's do it again  
  
Love ain't for the faint of heart  
Love's for you and me  
  
Love ain't for the faint of heart  
Love's for you and me

Look what my heart has gotten into  
The sweetest gift I ever knew  
It's even better than my favorite shoes  
Look what my heart has found in you  
  
[Chorus]  
Feels like sunshine, feels like rain  
Lord it feels like love finally called my name  
I want to jump and shout I want to sing and dance  
Lord it feels like love wants a second chance  
  
Look what my heart can clearly see  
How much I crave your company  
A true companion I will always be  
Look what my heart has done to me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Looks like my heart has become  
The safest place for us to run  
I'll be here for you when the day is done  
Looks like my heart has found someone  
  
[Chorus]

One look, one kiss  
Just a few words  
Showed me such kindness  
Your eyes really see me  
Not for what I've been  
But for who I am and what I could be  
  
[Chorus]  
How did you know I was waiting?  
How did you know you were saving me?  
Oh what a gift to leave it all behind  
Lonely has known me for the last time  
  
This love is forever  
It won't be taken  
For granted not ever  
  
[Chorus]

Oh, I'm drawn to you  
Like a burnin' flame  
But somebody's waitin'  
That bears my name  
Oh, Lord knows I'd love to love you  
Cause you know I'm just a man  
But I can't  
Not from where I stand.  
  
You see I made a promise  
When I put on that rign  
And I plan to kep it, babe  
It's a sacred thing  
Well, heaven knows I'm tempted  
I hope you understand  
That I can't  
Not from where I stand.  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
Oh, from where I stand  
There's a golden band  
And I swear I couldn't stand  
To lose it all  
So, I better run  
While I still can  
Cause I can't, babe  
Not from where I stand.  
  
No I can't, not from where I stand  
Yeah, not from where I stand

Give me the highway  
Lord knows I love to roam  
Give me the highway  
Well, I can hear the lonesome whistle moan  
White lines, neon signs  
Have always been my home  
Give me the highway  
'Cause I was born a rollin' stone  
Down every road I travel  
Lord, to you might look the same  
But maybe you might tell me  
Every town's got a different name  
I'd like to find a woman  
That won't hell-bent to tie me down  
Someone to be content  
To go anywhere I'm bound  
Give me the highway  
Lord knows I love to roam  
Give me the highway  
Well, I can hear the lonesome whistle moan  
White lines, neon signs  
Have always been my home  
Give me the highway  
'Cause I was born a rollin' stone  
Give me the highway  
Lord knows I love to roam  
Give me the highway  
Well, I can hear the lonesome whistle moan  
White lines, neon signs  
Have always been my home  
Give me the highway  
'Cause I was born a rollin' stone  
Give me the highway  
'Cause I was born a rollin' stone  

It's been a long day, Tell me how you've been  
Sorry it's so late, But here we go again  
We're sitting here together  
Your hand in mine I could stay here forever  
Given more time  
  
Given more time to laugh and dance  
Give more time to have the chance  
To show you this where, I want to be  
But that old clock up on the wall  
It don't even care at all  
Lord I wish I was given more time  
For you and me  
  
Honey how was your day  
Did you spend it on the run  
I know the kids are okay  
Thanks for getting things done  
In a few more hours, The sun's gonna shine  
I wish I had the power, To be given more time

I know your life  
On earth was troubled  
And only you could know the pain.  
You weren't afraid to face the devil,  
You were no stranger to the rain.  
  
Go rest high on that mountain  
Son,your work on earth is done.  
Go to heaven a-shoutin'  
Love for the Father and the Son.  
  
Oh,how we cried the day you left us  
We gathered round your grave to grieve.  
I wish I could see the angels faces  
When they hear your sweet voice sing.  
  
Go rest high on that mountain  
Son,your work on earth is done.  
Go to heaven a-shoutin'  
Love for the Father and the Son.

Whenever my soul is lonely  
Whenever I'm feeling blue  
I start thinkin' 'bout my blue eyed darlin'  
And my heart starts pinin' for you  
  
[Chorus]  
I want to hear that high lonesome sound  
Cause my sweet baby ain't around  
When my life's got me down  
I want to hear that high lonesome sound  
  
When I'm lost in this ocean of darkness  
Not knowing which way I should turn  
And my eyes are filled with sadness  
Of knowing you'll never return

Oh, I can't find a way to keep pretending  
I'm doin' alright on my own  
And I can't find the strength to keep believin'  
That you'll ever come back home  
But I'm tryin' to put this behind me  
And I've been cryin' more than you know  
I'd be lyin' to say this won't kill me  
Oh, I'm dyin' 'cause I can't let go  
And I can't find a way to keep pretending  
Well, I'm doin' alright on my own  
And I can't find the strength to keep believin'  
That you'll ever come back home  
Oh, your perfume still lingers all around me  
In our bedroom where I loved you so  
I'd be lyin' to say this won't kill me  
Oh, I'm dyin' 'cause I can't let go  
I'd be lyin' to say this won't kill me  
Oh, I'm dyin' 'cause I can't let go  

[Chorus]  
Well I never really knew you 'til you said goodbye  
You said it's finally over, here's the reasons why  
You said you've heard enough of all those little lies  
I never really knew you 'til you said goodbye  
  
I thought I made you happy but you've proved me wrong  
I thought I was the one that really turned you on  
When I came home tonight all my things were gone  
I guess gettin' over me didn't take you long  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Well, you said you'd heard enough of all those little lies  
I never really knew you 'til you said goodbye  
No I never really knew you 'til you said goodbye

When you said you were leavin'  
I said here we go again  
I ain't even breakin' even  
In this game I just can't win  
  
The cards are stacked against me  
Your aces beat my twos  
Seems like bad luck travels with me  
Like I was born to lose  
  
[Chorus]  
I quit  
I've had enough of fallin' in and out of love  
I'm done, I'm through, that's it  
If I can't have you, I quit  
  
You were my only sunshine  
In a world of pouring of pouring rain  
So this will be my last time  
I can't go through this again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm done, I'm through, that's it If I can't have you, I quit

If I can make Mississippi  
Then I'll be alright  
These ol' white lines are lonely  
On this two-lane tonight  
I've got just enough whiskey  
To keep me warm till the mornin' light  
If I can make Mississippi  
Mississippi tonight  
I headed out west  
To seek my fortune and fame  
I sure made a mess  
It took it all but my name  
Why I ever left?  
I can never explain  
If I can make Mississippi  
Through this pouring rain  
If I can make Mississippi  
Then I'll be alright  
These ol' white lines are lonely  
And the headlights are bright  
I've got just enough whiskey  
To keep me warm till the mornin' light  
If I could make Mississippi  
Mississippi tonight  
She said, she would wait  
She said our love was strong  
Well, I'm just so afraid  
I've been gone for too long  
When I walk through that gate  
Will she be there or long, long gone?  
If I can make Mississippi  
If I can make it back home  
If I can make Mississippi  
If I can make it back home  

If I didn't have you in my world  
What a lonely place my world would be  
If I didn't have you in my world  
I think I'd just pack up and leave  
  
It seems like I've waited a lifetime  
To find someone special like you  
If you ever walked out of my life  
I don't know what I would do  
  
'Cause if I didn't have you in my world  
What a lonely place my world would be  
If I didn't have you in my world  
I think I'd just pack up and leave  
  
You gave me a reason for livin'  
The first time I looked in your eyes  
I shudder to think what might happen  
If you ever told me goodbye  
  
'Cause if I didn't have you in my world  
What a lonely place my world would be  
If I didn't have you in my world  
I think I'd just pack up and leave

If I had my way, we'd love one another  
If I had my way, we'd all live as brothers  
There'd be no more fussing and fighting  
No more hungry innocent dying  
I'd make it all go away  
If I had my way  
  
If I had my way  
I'd carry your burden  
If I had my way  
No one would be hurtin'  
And there'd be no more hatred and lying  
No more lonely little kids crying  
I'd make it all go away  
If I had my way  
  
Maybe one day the walls will come down  
If I had my way, the lost would be found  
Love will find a way to turn everything around  
  
There'd be no more fussing and fighting  
No more frightened little kids crying  
I'd make it all go away  
If I had my way

If she'd only knew what I was thinking  
If she'd only knew what was in my head  
Why can't she see my heart is breaking  
She'd be mine if it weren't for him.  
  
So many times I dreamed I had her  
I call her name when I lay down  
Still I can't learn to live without  
Her jealous heart is all I found.  
  
See your face would be my destiny  
Now I won't take what you can give to me  
This lonely place is all I hope to find  
If it weren't for him then you'd be mine.  
  
If he'd only knew what I was thinking  
If he'd only knew what was in my head  
Why can't he see my heart is breaking  
He'd be mine if it weren't for him.  
  
You'd be mine if it weren't for him

Baby I'm so sorry your world came crashing in  
It's times like these you need a friend  
You don't have to worry it's out of our hands  
I believe that we're part of a much bigger plan  
  
[Chorus]  
If there's anything I can do  
Just call and I'll come runnin'  
I will always be here for you  
If there's anything I can do  
  
Your eyes are filled with sorrow  
Your heart is filled with pain  
Just let the tears fall down like rain  
I promise you tomorrow  
The sun is gonna shine  
All you can do is take it one day at a time  
  
[Chorus]

You're climbing mountains, I'm on a hill  
You're always running I'm standing still  
You live for the moment, no future no past  
I may be a fool to love by the rules and want it to last  
  
[Chorus]  
If you ever have forever in mind  
I'll be here and easy to find  
If your heart isn't ready to lay down with mine  
If you ever have forever in mind  
  
The music has ended still you want to dance  
I know that feeling, I can't take that chance  
You live for the moment no future no past  
I may be a fool to love by the rules, I want it to last  
  
[Chorus]

When the Texas moon is shining down on Austin  
When it shines across the Rio Grande  
When it comes to makin' love  
Under the stars above  
Well honey I'll take Texas everytime  
  
We danced in every ballroom down in Beaumont  
And we strolled the river walk in San Antone  
It's where we fell in love  
Like to young turtle doves  
Well honey I'll take Texas everytime  
  
When it comes to makin' love  
Under the stars above  
Honey I'll take Texas  
Honey I'll take Texas  
Honey I'll take Texas  
Honey I'll take Texas everytime

In these last few days, you've been on my mind  
An' we should get together an' talk about old times  
An' put the past behind us before life slips away  
I've been thinkin' 'bout you in these last few days  
In these last few days, I have felt my age  
I wish that I was younger but time has turned the page  
I sure miss the water and the rhythm of the waves  
I've been feelin' fragile in these last few days  
But I have been a father, a husband and a son  
Lookin' back is bitter sweet, now that my race has run  
I've tried to be a witness from the cradle to the grave  
Time has felt so precious in these last few days  
In these last few days, I've seen the light  
And I'll be waitin' for you on the other side  
My old friend, I love you, that's really all there's left to say  
Lay down here beside me in these last few days  
My old friend, I'll miss you but I'm trying to be brave  
Lay down here beside me in these last few days  

Oh, the weather outside is frightful  
But the fire is so delightful  
And since we've no place to go  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow!  
  
Hey! It doesn't show signs of stopping  
And I've brought some corn for popping  
The lights are turned way down low  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow!  
  
And when we finally kiss good night  
How I'll hate going out in the storm  
But if you really hold me tight  
All the way home I'll be warm.  
  
The fire is slowly dying  
Hey! and, Honey, we're still good-bying  
But as long as you love me so,  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow!...

Let there be peace on earth  
And let it begin with me  
Let There Be Peace on Earth  
The peace that was meant to be  
  
With God as our Father  
Brothers all are we  
Let me walk with my brother  
In perfect harmony.  
  
Let peace begin with me  
Let this be the moment now.  
  
With ev'ry step I take  
Let this be my solemn vow  
To take each moment and live  
Each moment in peace eternally  
Let there be peace on earth  
And let it begin with me

Stars are falling from your eyes  
You don't feel what I feel inside  
Your hand is warm but your heart is cold  
If you're hurtin' you don't let it show  
  
How much longer can we go on  
Actin' like there's nothin' wrong  
How much farther can we drift apart  
Before all the feeling is gone  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm losing your love  
It's slippin' away  
Minute by minute  
Day by day  
Losing your love  
Don't you think I know  
It's a matter of time  
'Til you let go  
  
I see the moon shinin' up above  
Reminded me how good it was  
There's a chill comin' over me  
Why can't it be like it used to be  
  
I feel so helpless, I can't make you stay  
No matter how hard I try  
I can't deny that look in your eyes  
Tryin' to tell me goodbye  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Don't let go  
Don't let go  
Don't let go  
Don't let go

You say your heart has been broken  
And it's taking forever to mend  
And it's left you even more certain  
That you'll never love again  
A long time ago someone told me  
It's not love that causes the pain  
Whenever a heart has been shattered  
It's the losing of love that's to blame  
  
Love never broke anyone's heart  
It never left anyone scarred  
It's not really love if it tears you apart  
Love never broke anyone's heart  
  
I know your feelings are tender  
And you're so afraid they won't heal  
I'll prove to you love doesn't hurt you  
And I'll show you how true love should feel  
  
Love never broke anyone's heart  
It never left anyone scarred  
It's not really love if it tears you apart  
Love never broke anyone's heart

Loving you makes me a better man  
These things I don't know how to do  
But you make me think I can  
  
I've got a long way to go  
But I know what I know like the back of my hand  
Loving you makes me a better man  
  
I've been wrong, more than I cared to say  
Time after time I've been lost  
Just couldn't find my way  
  
You shed a light on the path through the night  
Leading right to the side where I stand  
Loving you makes me a better man  
  
I make mistakes, didn't have what it takes  
Just to walk out leave it alone  
I've got a long lot of heartaches that follow me home  
  
Time goes on and I watch you disappear  
I've got a mount to mount  
Now that I have you near  
  
You came to me and it's easy to see  
There's a line that I've crossed in the sand  
Loving you makes me a better man  
Loving you makes me a better man

I've been sittin' here talkin' at you all night long  
Now honey you still come off cool  
Well you could have walked away instead you're leadin' me on  
Lucy who you tryin' to fool  
  
Yeah, Lucy Dee  
You ain't got to run that line on me  
Well it's plain to see  
That you ain't all that you're made out to be  
Well you can tell all your friends  
That you finally met your equal, Lucy Dee  
  
You've known all along just what I'm talkin' about  
Well you knew someday there'd come a man  
Who wouldn't keep on givin' 'til he finally gave out  
Lucy, honey, here I stand  
  
Well you tell me you've known every thrill there is to know  
And nothin' in this life comes free, nothin'  
Well you tell me you've been every way there is to go  
Lucy you ain't been with me  
  
Poor Lucy Dee

Molly Brown, waits for me  
In a little one-horse town  
And Boley, Oklahoma  
Where white folks don't come around  
I'm thinkin' about you, Molly  
I'm forbidden to come 'round  
Lord knows I love you, Molly  
Molly Brown  
Molly Brown, Molly Brown  
Lay down by my side  
Show me how you spread your wings  
And let that pony ride  
I'm crazy about you, Molly  
I don't care that your skin is brown  
Lord knows I need you, Molly  
Molly Brown  
Molly Brown  
Oh, Molly Brown  
We met down by the river  
She wore her wedding gown  
I never saw it coming  
And no one heard the sound  
My daddy used both barrels  
And left me there to drown  
Lord knows I'd die for Molly  
Molly Brown  
Molly Brown, Molly Brown  
Don't you weep for me  
I'm going to a place the Lord  
Prepared for you and me  
I'll meet you up in Heaven  
Upon that Holy ground  
I'll be waitin' for you, Molly  
Molly Brown  
Molly Brown, Molly Brown, Molly Brown  
Lord, I'll be waitin' up in Heavenly  
My sweet little brown, Molly Brown  

No other lover ever really cared  
When I've reached out for you you've always been there  
Now I'm so far away and baby I'm scared  
I never knew lonely til you  
  
You are my rock and the strength I need  
To keep me sane in this life that I lead  
Now I'm not with you and my broken heart bleeds  
I never knew lonely til you  
  
I never knew lonely could be so blue  
I never knew lonely could tear you in two  
I never loved someone like I love you  
I never knew lonely til you  
  
I can't make up for the times I've been gone  
But I'll prove I love you in the words of this song  
Back in your arms girl it's where I belong  
I never knew lonely til you  
  
I never knew lonely could be so blue  
I never knew lonely could tear you in two  
I never loved someone like I love you  
I never knew lonely til you

From my room I can hear you laughing  
You spend all your time with my best friend  
Oh, I wish you knew how bad I've fallen for you  
There's no way to know how things may end  
  
Cause babe, I don't know where to start  
Longing is the hardest part  
There ain't no easy way into your heart  
  
In my mind I can see us together  
Crazy in love and paintin' the town  
When you look at him I know there's no way I can win  
I came running for you, would you turn me down?  
  
Cause babe, I don't know where to start  
Longing is the hardest part  
There ain't no easy way into your heart  
  
Babe, I don't know where to start  
Longing is the hardest part  
There ain't no easy way into your heart  
  
Babe, I don't know where to start  
Longing is the hardest part  
There ain't no easy way into your heart

I lie here tonight in the darkness  
I've never felt so alone  
tomorrow I'll wake up still lonesome  
'Cause things haven't changed since you've gone  
  
You walked out with angry words spoken  
You're leavin' cut right to the bone  
I'll pick up the pieces you have broken  
Find the strength to go on  
  
I still remember  
How my love once held her  
How long do old memories last  
Why can't I forget it  
Why can't I admit it  
There ain't no future in the past  
  
I still remember  
How my love once held her  
How long do old memories last  
Why can't I forget it  
Why can't I admit it  
There ain't no future in the past

I work my fingers to the bone  
Just trying to keep up with the Jones  
You call me on the telephone  
Say baby hurry hurry home  
  
Pour me a little splash of red  
You look like you could raise the dead  
Have you got something on your mind  
Come on girl we're wasting time  
  
(Chorus)  
Just let your body do the talking  
Don't let the words get in the way  
Yeah I can tell the way you're walking  
That you got nothing left to say  
  
Ain't gonna watch the evening news  
Cause I don't care who's shooting who  
You're putting on my favorite shoes  
About to do that thing you do  
  
Ah let's do it all night long  
Cause in the morning I'll be gone  
If everything works out all right  
Same place, same time tomorrow night  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ain't got nothin' to say  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah I can tell the way you're walking  
That you got nothing left to say  
Nothin' baby

Oh there's nothin' like a woman  
When you're all alone  
No there's nothin' like a woman  
To make a man come home  
She's always there to understand  
The little boy inside of the man  
Oh there's nothin' like a woman  
Nothin' at all  
  
She knows when to hold you  
And when to leave you alone  
She's there to console you  
When everything in the world's gone wrong  
She lights a candle  
And gets that look in her eye  
And she's says boy you can handle  
Staying up with me all night  
  
Oh there's nothin' like a woman  
When you're all alone No there's nothin' like her lovin'  
To make a man come home  
She's always there to understand  
The little boy inside of the man  
No there's nothin' like a woman  
Nothin' at all  
  
No there's nothin' like a woman  
When you're all alone  
No there's nothin' like a woman  
To make a man come home  
She's always there to understand  
The little boy inside of the man  
No there's nothin' like a woman  
Nothin' at all  

O holy night  
The stars are brightly shining  
It is the night of our dear savior's birth  
Long lay the world in sin and error pining  
  
Till he appeared and the soul felt its worth  
A thrill of hope the weary soul rejoices  
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn  
Fall on your knees  
  
O hear the angels' voices  
O night divine, o night when Christ was born  
O night, O holy night, O night divine  
O night divine, O night, O night divine

O Little town of Bethlehem  
How still we see thee lie  
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep  
the silent stars go by  
Yet in the dark street shineth  
the everlasting light  
the hopes and fears of all the years  
are met in thee tonight  
  
For Christ is born of Mary and gathered all above  
while mortals sleep the angels keep  
their watch of wandering love  
O morning stars together  
proclaim the holy birth  
and praises sing to god our king  
and peace to men on earth

Well it's rainin' down in Houston  
And I got holes in both my shoes  
Baby's put me on the street  
She says "I'm through with you"  
  
She thinks I'm gonna miss her  
Someone tell her that she's wrong  
I'm goin' back to Oklahoma, boys  
'Cause that's where I belong  
  
I need one good ride  
I'll be satisfied  
Come on Oklahoma borderline  
If we roll all night  
She'll be comin' into sight  
Come on Oklahoma borderline  
  
Well now I don't need no Texas girl  
Doggin' me around  
I may be a Okie, son  
But I've still been to town  
  
Well those Oklahoma city girls  
They always treat you right  
Well tell mama that I'm comin' home (not sure of this line...)  
And I'm leavin' out tonight  
  
I need one good ride  
I'll be satisfied  
Come on Oklahoma borderline  
If we roll all night  
She'll be comin' into sight  
Come on Oklahoma borderline  
  
So with two bucks in my pocket  
And my thumb stuck in the wind  
When I cross Red River, boys  
I won't be back again  
  
Give me old back roads and truck stops  
And 18 wheels that whine  
And some good ol' boy to take me  
To that Oklahoma line  
  
I need one good ride  
I'll be satisfied  
Come on Oklahoma borderline  
If we roll all night  
She'll be comin' into sight  
Come on Oklahoma borderline  
  
I caught one good ride  
She's comin' into sight  
Hello Oklahoma borderline  

Ther's a redhead from my hometown that loves to let her hair down  
She tears my heart out when she starts to sing  
She's from the right side of Red River and she's pretty as a picture  
Don't you know she's this ole cowboy's dream  
  
There's a boy from Okie City and I sure think he's pretty  
But I know he's trying to steal my heart away  
Oh my mama tried to warn me he's done time in California  
But he'll be an Okie til his dyin' day  
  
There's a dance we do in Oklahoma  
A dnace like you've never seen  
Sit back and we're gonna show ya  
How to do that Oklahoma swing  
  
Well when two Okies get together man there's nothin' they like better  
Than to hold each other on a dawdust floor  
Oh I love it when we're swayin' to those sweet twi fiddles playin'  
Come on boy what are we waitin' for  
  
There's a dance we do in Oklahoma  
A dnace like you've never seen  
Sit back and we're gonna show ya  
How to do that Oklahoma swing  
  
Yeah there's a dance we do in Oklahoma  
A dnace like you've never seen  
Sit back and we're gonna show ya  
Yeah how to do that Oklahoma swing  
How to do that Oklahoma swing

I wanna hear an old time fiddle  
Play an old time fiddle song  
I might even drink just a little  
If you play 'Little Jolie Blon'  
If you're lookin' or me  
I'm liable to be  
In the middle of the ol' dance floor  
I wanna hear an old time fiddle  
Like you never get to hear anymore  
  
[Chorus:]  
I wanna throw down on a hoe down  
Hanging with the people I know  
Hear the sweet sound  
Of a breakdown  
When you put a little rosin on the bow  
Y'all come on over when the sun goes down  
Bang on the ol' screen door  
I wanna hear an old time fiddle  
Like you never get to hear anymore  
  
I miss ol' Herman Stover  
Playin' Listen To The Mockingbird  
It was Piedmont, Oklahoma  
It was the sweetest sound I ever heard  
Skinny ol' man in a cowboy band  
You could barely get the people in the door  
I wanna hear an old time fiddle  
Like you never get to hear anymore  
  
I wanna throw down on a hoe down  
Hanging with the people I know  
Hear the sweet sound  
Of a breakdown  
When you put a little rosin on the bow  
Play diggy diggy li  
Diggy diggy lo  
The a little Cotten-Eyed Joe  
I wanna hear an old time fiddle  
Like you never get to hear anymore.  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Y'all come on over when the sun goes down  
Bang on the ol' screen door  
I wanna hear an old time fiddle  
Like you never get to hear anymore...

Oh baby when you came walkin' in  
I went crazy wonderin' where you been  
I think maybe I just fell in love again  
  
She ain't no Peggy Sue, sweet Mary Lou  
She ain't no Maybeline, pretty miss Norma Jean  
But I'd give up everything  
For just one dance with you  
  
Oh baby I sure like the way you move  
I go crazy when you shake that thing the way you do  
You think maybe I could have a dance with you  
  
She ain't no Peggy Sue, sweet Mary Lou  
She ain't no Maybeline, pretty miss Norma Jean  
But I'd give up everything  
For just one dance with you  
  
She ain't no Peggy Sue, sweet Mary Lou  
She ain't no Maybeline, pretty miss Norma Jean  
But I'd give up everything  
For just one dance with you  

She was standing at the front door  
When I came home last night  
A good book in her left hand  
And a rollin' pin in the right  
She said you've come home for the last time  
With whiskey on your breath  
If you don't listen to my preachin' boy  
I'm goin' to have to beat you half to death  
  
Give me just a one more last chance  
Before you say we're through  
I know I drive you crazy baby  
It's the best that I can do  
We're just some good ol' boys, a makin' noise  
I ain't a runnin' 'round on you  
Give me just a one more last chance  
Before you say we're through  
  
First she hid my glasses  
'Cause she knows that I can't see  
She said you ain't goin' nowhere boy  
'Til you spend a little time with me  
Then the boys called from the honky tonk  
Said there's a party goin' on down here  
Well she might've took my car keys  
But she forgot about my old John Deere  
  
So give me just a one more last chance  
Before you say we're through  
I know I drive you crazy baby  
It's the best that I can do  
We're just some good ol' boys, a makin' noise  
I ain't a runnin' 'round on you  
Give me just a one more last chance  
Before you say we're through

You've got legs just like a long neck bottle  
And lips just like strawberry wine  
You might be a lifetime of trouble  
But still I can't get you out of my mind  
  
Out of my mind, I'm goin' out of my mind  
And I see what I've been missin' all this time  
Oh, sweet neon angel, don't leave me behind  
No, I can't get you out of my mind  
  
You're bringin' on a honky-tonk heartache  
And I know you'd never walk the line  
To let you slip away, it's a chance I won't take  
Still I can't get you out of my mind  
  
Out of my mind, I'm goin' out of my mind  
And I see what I've been missin' all this time  
Oh, sweet neon angel, don't leave me behind  
No, I can't get you out of my mind  
No, I can't get you out of my mind

He slipped the ring off his finger  
When he walked in the room  
And he found him some stranger  
And promised her the moon  
How many lies you must have told  
You think you're a rich man  
With your pocket full of gold  
  
For another man's treasure  
You'd say anything  
But is one night of pleasure  
Worth the trouble you'll bring  
Don't look so surprised  
'Cause son I should know  
I once was a rich man  
With my pocket full of gold  
  
Some night you're gonna wind up  
On the wrong end of a gun  
Some jealous guy's gonna show up  
And you'll pay for what you've done  
What will it say on your tombstone  
Here lies a rich man  
With his pocket full of gold  
  
Yeah, here lies a rich man  
With his pocket full of gold

You sure have a pretty smile  
It sure has been a while  
Since I've felt your touch  
You've got the sweetest way  
I think about you every day  
I miss you so much  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh my pretty little Adriana  
Are you lonesome tonight  
Oh my pretty little Adriana  
I'll find you when it all feels right  
  
You're so soft and innocent  
The sweetest night I ever spent  
Was being held in your embrace  
You're such a gentle soul  
It's killing me to know  
When will I see your face

I've seen the way he cast his spell  
He's gonna hurt you I can tell  
Just to prove that he can be your lover  
He's gonna turn on that charm  
Tonight he'll wrap you in his arms  
Tomrrow he will leave you for another  
  
Pretty is as pretty does  
That's how it is and always was  
Pretty words are all he's givin' you  
And when he whispers int he dark  
Watch out he's gonna break your heart  
'Cause pretty words won't make your dreams come true  
They're just pretty words  
Just pretty words  
  
In the morning you will find  
That you were just the next in line  
there's nothing I can do that's gonna stop you  
Before you go just let me say  
I'd never treat your love that way  
I'll be here long after he's forgot you  
  
Pretty is as pretty does  
That's how it is and always was  
Pretty words are all he's givin' you  
And when he whispers int he dark  
Watch out he's gonna break your heart  
'Cause pretty words won't make your dreams come true  
They're just pretty words  
Just pretty words

There's a long white line stretching out on the road ahead  
And there ain't one magazine that I ain't read  
I haven't seen you in weeks but I hear you on the radio  
Singing soft and low  
  
We're so far apart  
This old highway ain't home  
When the heartache starts  
I just turn the radio on  
  
There never seems to be time for me and you  
That's a price you pay for the life you choose  
Tonight's the loneliest night I've ever known  
It just goes on and on  
  
We're so far apart  
This old highway ain't home  
When the heartache starts  
I just turn the radio on  
  
It does my heart good to see you shine  
So I'll just keep on counting these white lines  
I haven't seen you in weeks but I hear you on the radio  
Calling me back home  
  
We're so far apart  
This old highway ain't home  
When the heartache starts  
I just turn the radio on  

Oh the taste of wine and liquor and a woman's tender kiss  
Sure paints the perfect picture that's so hard to resist  
Though the lure of the old night life has always tempted fools  
It can't compare with what you stand to lose  
  
[Chorus]  
Remember the promise you wear on your left hand  
Cheatin's no companion for a real lady's man  
  
If only I had listened to my own words of advice  
And turned down the invitation in another woman's eyes  
For the softness of a stranger, I threw good love away  
Friend there ain't no higher price to pay  
  
[Chorus]

No man ever sounded so lonesome  
No man ever made you feel such pain  
Lord, it must have been a real mean bottle  
That made you sing that way  
The stories you told about prison  
About a young man gone astray  
Lord, it must have been a real mean bottle  
That made you write the songs that way  
A real mean bottle poured straight from the devil  
It's a miracle you're standin' here today  
A real mean bottle made you such a rebel  
Must've been a real mean bottle made you sing that way  
You spent most all your life with strangers  
With a ramblin' fever in your veins  
Hag, it must have been a real mean bottle  
That made you play the blues that way  
A real mean bottle poured straight from the devil  
It's a miracle you're standin' here today  
A real mean bottle made you such a rebel  
It must've been a real mean bottle made you sing that way  
A real mean bottle poured straight from the devil  
It must've been a real mean bottle made you sing that way  

You'd better watch out, you'd better not cry  
You'd better not pout, I'm telling you why:  
Santa Claus is coming to town  
  
He's making a list, checking it twice  
He's gonna find out who's naughty and nice  
Santa Claus is coming to town  
  
He sees you when you're sleeping  
He knows when you're awake  
He knows if you've been bad or good  
So be good for goodness sake!  
  
With little tin horns and little toy drums  
Rooty-toot-toots and rum-a-tum-tums  
Santa Claus is coming to town  
  
And curly-head dolls that toddle and coo  
Elephants, boats, and kiddy cars too  
Santa Claus is coming to town  
  
The kids in Girl- and Boyland will have a jubilee  
They're gonna build a Toyland town  
All around the Christmas tree

Only a memory this morning  
My baby up and walked away  
In my heart the tears keep pouring  
She left with so much more to say  
  
[Chorus]  
She don't know whose heart she's breaking  
She don't know my dream lies still  
She don't know how much she's taking  
She don't know and never will  
  
I can't sleep, I've gotta find her  
I've got to make her understand  
Although another love may bind her  
No one can love her like I can  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
She don't know (she don't know)  
She don't know (she don't know)  
She don't know (she don't know)

There's no need to hide anything  
Baby just know what you bring  
Will always be enough  
All of those things that you do  
Are the reasons that I fell for you  
And why, I believe in us  
  
[Chorus]  
Baby shoot straight from your heart  
You'll never miss your mark  
Baby always shoot straight from your heart  
Let truth be the path that you choose  
There ain't no way we can lose  
Baby always shoot straight from your heart  
  
We're gonna make some mistakes  
'Cause baby I sure ain't no saint  
I swear I'm in for the long haul  
It doesn't matter how far  
I love you just how you are  
I will answer when you call  
  
[Chorus]

When the storms of the day have all blown away  
Along with fair weather friends  
There's a place I can go where the wind doesn't blow  
It's the best place I've ever been  
  
You're a sight for sore eyes  
When I need a friend  
You're a sight for sore eyes  
Let the healing begin  
  
When the chips are all down and there's no one around  
To count on like I count on you  
I just picture your face and let it erase  
All the pain I'm goin' through  
  
You're a sight for sore eyes  
When I need a friend  
You're a sight for sore eyes  
Let the healing begin  
  
When I get lost and I can't find my way  
And there's nowhere to turn at the end of the day  
  
You're a sight for sore eyes  
When I need a friend  
You're a sight for sore eyes  
Let the healing begin  
  
You're a sight for sore eyes  
Let the healing begin

City sidewalks, busy sidewalks  
Dressed in holiday style  
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas  
Children laughing, people passing  
Meeting smile after smile  
And on every street corner you hear  
  
Silver bells, silver bells  
It's Christmas time in the city  
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring  
Soon it will be Christmas Day  
  
Strings of street lights, even stop lights  
Blink a bright red and green  
As the shoppers rush home with their treasures  
Hear the snow crunch, see the kids bunch  
This is Santa's big scene  
And above all the bustle you hear

I've done some things that I hadn't oughta  
Like coming home late with the preacher's daughter  
I'd hit the back door seeing double  
My ol' man waiting with a fistful of trouble  
  
Sometimes you lose, sometimes you're a winner  
You talk about love, I ain't no beginner  
I'm a sucker for a juke joint jumpin'  
I never stop chasin' the scent of the woman  
  
It's just the way that I've always been  
You knock me down, I'm coming back again  
I sing, I've been there and I've done that  
I come up smilin' song  
  
I've been on top and I've hit the bottom  
You talk about hard times Lord, I've got 'em  
Just keep on runnin' and go in full of throttle  
There ain't no answer in the bottom of a bottle  
  
It's just the way that I've always been  
You knock me down, I'm coming back again  
I sing, I've been there and I've done that  
I come up smilin' song  
  
Come up smilin'  
  
It's just the way that I've always been  
You knock me down, I'm coming back again  
I sing, I've been there and I've done that  
I come up smilin' song  
  
It's just the way that I've always been  
You knock me down, I'm coming back again  
I sing, I've been there and I've done that  
And I come up smilin' song  
  
Oh, keep on smilin'  
Oh, keep on smilin'

Have you ever watched the sunset  
Disappear in the water down in Mexico?  
The sky on fire melting into the ocean  
Man, there's some things that never get old  
  
Have you ever seen a baby walk for the first time?  
It's like watching a sparrow, a sparrow's wings unfold  
And when that baby, she smiles up at you  
Man, there's some things that never get old  
  
Makin' sweet love to that gal of mine  
My first taste of bluebird wine  
Eatin' watermelon down to the rind  
Any old song by brother John Prine  
  
Sometimes that face looking back in the mirror  
It make that mirror, make that mirror cold, babe  
But in my heart, oh, I'm a hundred years younger  
Man, there's some things that never get old, no, no  
  
I ride into town with some friends of mine  
It's a two-tone Chevy, she's a 59  
Ice cold beer in the summertime  
Pickin' on the back porch with brother John Prine  
  
Well, I think livin' is one long highway  
I'm bettin' Heaven is at the end of the road  
And I think love just might be the answer  
Man, there's some things that never get old  
And I think love, oh Lord, I know it's the answer  
Oh, there's some things that never get old

Have you ever had a thing for a woman  
A thing that makes you lose your mind?  
Every time I start to think about her  
Sends shivers up and down my spine  
My daddy was a bit of a rounder  
Said these women are gonna make you go blind  
I told my old man that I'm right over here  
Like the way I see just fine  
I'm the son of a ramblin' man  
Son of a runnin' kind  
I'm the son of a ramblin' man  
I come from a long, long line  
Well, I'm just a hillbilly gypsy  
I ain't much for settling down  
If I thought somebody might miss me  
Maybe I'd hang around  
So I better keep on drifting  
As every town just a little too small  
Ain't nothin' in the world like a woman  
I'm going to try to love them all  
I'm the son of a ramblin' man  
Son of a runnin' kind  
I'm the son of a ramblin' man  
I come from a long, long line  
I'm the son of a ramblin' man  
Son of a runnin' kind  
I'm the son of a ramblin' man  
I come from a long, long line  
I'm the son of a ramblin' man  
Son of a runnin' kind  
I'm the son of a ramblin' man  
I come from a long, long line  
I'm the son of a ramblin' man  
Son of a runnin' kind  
I'm the son of a ramblin' man  
I come from a long, long line  

You know I'm about to lose my mind  
I got a woman down below the Mason-Dixon line  
She deals the cards awful good to me  
She's a blackjack dealer on the Delta Queen  
  
[Chorus]  
On the south side of Dixie  
From Savannah Georgia down to New Orleans  
On the south side of Dixie  
Women there they don't treat you mean  
On the south side of Dixie  
A side of the south you ain't never seen  
  
Half a tank north of Birmingham  
Red eye gravy and country ham  
Chattanooga woman sure is sweet  
She's a hillbilly singer from Tennessee  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If you go down south, you're gonna have a ball  
You'll go half crazy tryin' to love 'em all  
You might get lucky, you can't never tell  
With them Georgia peaches and them southern belles  
  
[Chorus]

Sparkle, there's gotta be a sparkle  
For you to love somebody  
For you to really know  
Brighter than the lights in the city  
It's more than being pretty  
The way you are inside  
  
Why are you crying  
Somebody's trying  
To be with you only all the time  
You hide behind tears  
Counting the fears  
You're so used to being alone  
  
Sparkle, there's gotta be a sparkle  
For you to love somebody  
For you to really know  
Sparkle, you got a certain sparkle  
I know I love somebody  
I gotta let it show  
  
Nobody knows you  
They can't get too close to  
A girl who won't let down her disguise  
You won't believe how much someone could love you  
That someone is looking in your eyes  
  
Sparkle, it's gotta be a sparkle  
For you to love somebody  
For you to really know  
Brighter than the lights of the city  
It's more than being pretty  
It's the way you feel inside  
Sparkle

She holds me when I'm sleepin'  
She wakes me with a kiss  
She is the only woman  
My heart cannot resist  
My sweet Augusta darlin'  
Comes from those Georgia pines  
My sweet Augusta darlin'  
The one true love of mine  
She whispers that she loves me  
She knows I feel the same  
I thank the Lord above me  
When I hear her call my name  
My sweet Augusta darlin'  
Comes from those Georgia pines  
My sweet Augusta darlin'  
The one true love of mine  
We'll praise this perfect union  
And we'll watch the years go by  
And we'll be such sweet companions  
Until the end of time  
My sweet Augusta darlin'  
Comes from those Georgia pines  
My sweet Augusta darlin'  
The one true love of mine  
My sweet Augusta darlin'  
The one true love of mine  

Well, here comes my little baby  
Here comes my turtle dove  
She drives me crazy  
She's the one that I love  
  
She's got a way about her  
I could never turn down  
I couldn't live without her  
She makes the world go around  
  
Sweet little Corrina  
Come over here by my side  
Sweet little Corrina  
Put your pretty little hand in mine  
  
You could search the world over  
Right up till the end of time  
Every night I get to hold her  
Sweet Corrina, now she's so fine  
  
She's my little angel  
My little beauty queen  
She never met a stranger  
She's the girl of my dreams  
  
She's a ballerina  
Sweet as she can be  
Ought to see the way  
She's smilin' at me  
  
Sweet little Corrina  
Come over here by my side  
Sweet little Corrina  
Put your pretty little hand in mine  
  
You could search the world over  
Right up till the end of time  
Every night I get to hold her  
Sweet Corrina, now she's so fine  
  
Sweet little Corrina  
Come over here by my side  
Sweet little Corrina  
Put your pretty little hand in mine  
  
You could search the world over  
Right up till the end of time  
Every night I get to hold her  
Sweet Corrina, now she's so fine

I'd be out runnin' most every night  
We'd always wind up in one hell of a fight  
The end is comin' there ain't no doubt  
But there's just that one thing I can't live without  
  
I won't try to stop you  
I can't change your mind  
It's been nice to know you  
Could you leave that sweet thing behind?  
  
You take the dishes, the silverware  
Well, I'll keep the hound dog and this easy chair  
Keep the Ranchero but that TV is mine  
She said, "You can stick that clicker where the sun don't shine"  
  
I know you're leaving  
I can't change your mind  
It's been nice to know you  
Could you leave that sweet thing behind?  
  
Well, that woman was real mean  
My trailer park drama queen  
I'm gonna have bad dreams  
About missing that sweet thing  
Oh Lord, I don't know what I am gonna do  
  
Why's a tornado like a redneck divorce?  
Either way somebody's bound to lose a mobile home of course  
Well, that's my story, it's sad but true  
I've only got one request of you  
  
I know you're leaving  
I can't change your mind  
It's been nice to know you  
Could you leave that sweet thing behind  
  
Well, I know you're leaving, baby  
I can't change your mind  
It's been nice to know you  
Could you leave that sweet thing behind?

I can read the writing on the wall  
You pretend that nothing's changed at all  
I've got just one thing to ask you if it's so  
Just take your memory with you when you go  
  
So I won't have to think about  
The lonely nights I'll be without  
Someone to hold me when the cold wind blows  
Take your memory with you when you go  
  
I walk the floor and wonder what went wrong  
I'll have to find a way to carry on  
Why don't you leave before the heartache starts to show  
Take your memory with you when you go  
  
So I won't have to think about  
The lonely nights I'll be without  
Someone to hold me when the cold wind blows  
Take your memory with you  
So I won't have to miss you  
Take your memory with you when you go

Tell me lover, tell me what you're gonna do  
You gonna walk the walk or just talk the talk  
Honey, what's up with you  
  
Tell me lover, tell me how it's gonna be  
You gonna mess around or just turn me down  
Honey, won't you please tell me  
  
Your good intentions ain't too good no more  
You answer questions by slammin' that bedroom door  
Come on baby let's turn the lamp down low  
I'll solve your problems so honey please don't go  
  
If the silence could kiill, honey we'd both be dead  
It ain't hard to tell we're hangin' on by a thread  
Say somethin' darlin' say what's on your mind  
We'll find the answer, I got nothin' but time

Tell me one more time about Jesus  
All about forgiveness and grace  
Tell me one more time about Jesus  
All about my Savior's face  
Here comes my old friend, the preacher  
He's knockin' on my front door  
He's out tryin' to save all the sinners  
He's been here so many times before  
I love the easy conversation  
Man, that preacher sure can talk  
It brings up my need for salvation  
Even though he knows I'm stubborn to a fault  
Tell me one more time about Jesus  
All about forgiveness and grace  
Tell me one more time about Jesus  
Lord, I need just a little more faith  
I walked by the church Sunday mornin'  
I slipped on in the back door  
It's sure been a long time coming  
And tell my preacher what I need to know  
His words were like a cool drink of water  
He said, "Sinners come on down the aisle"  
So I went runnin' for the alter  
You should have seen my old friend, the preacher smile  
Tell me one more time about Jesus  
All about forgiveness and grace  
Tell me one more time about Jesus  
I long to see my Savior's face  
Oh, I long to see my Savior's face  

That friend of mine wears an old work shirt  
For a long long time she has blessed this earth  
And a smile that shines even when she hurts  
O how I love that friend of mine  
That friend of mine gave her heart to me  
How sweet and kind the truth can be  
And God's tie that binds us as family  
Oh how I love that friend of mine  
  
She's an angel she's the answer  
The sweetest piece of heaven in my eyes  
She's drawn to me like gravity  
I'd lay down and die for that friend of mine  
  
She's an angel she's the answer  
The sweetest piece of heaven in my eyes  
She's drawn to me like gravity  
I'd lay down and die for that friend of mine  
I'd lay down and die for that friend of mine  
That friend of mine wears an old work shirt

Looking back over the years  
Of All the things I've always meant to say  
But words didn't come easily  
So many times through empty fears  
Of all of the nights I tried to pick up the phone  
So scared of who might be answering  
  
You try to live your life from day to day  
But seeing you across the room tonight  
Just gives me away  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause the heart won't lie  
Sometimes life gets in the way  
But there's one thing that won't change  
I know I've tried  
The heart won't lie  
You can live your alibi  
Who can see you're lost inside a foolish disguise  
The heart won't lie  
  
Long after tonight  
Will you still hear my voice through the radio  
Old desires make us act carelessly  
Long after tonight, after the fire  
After the scattered ashes fly  
Through the four winds blown and gone  
Will you come back to me?  
  
You try to live your life from day to day  
But seeing you across the room tonight  
Just gives me away  
  
[Chorus]

I was born in Guilford County  
Way back up in the pines  
It's where I hold the sweetest memories  
In the hills of Caroline  
  
My daddy wasn't much of nothin'  
Spent his life doin' time  
But mama learned me about Jesus  
In the hills of Caroline  
  
I met a girl her name was Hattie  
Fair and tender, sweet and kind  
She showed me how to love a woman  
In the hills of Caroline  
  
I always thought that we would marry  
One sweet day she would be mine  
But Hattie's gone, to live with Jesus  
In the hills of Caroline  
  
If I should die before tomorrow  
Just one request if you don't mind  
Just bury me right next to Hattie  
In the hills of Caroline  
  
Bury me right next to Hattie  
In the hills of Caroline

I'd love to hear my daddy play once again  
All the songs that he taught me when I was a kid  
John Henry, Ol' Shep and Faded Love  
I Fall To Pieces and On The Wings Of A Dove  
  
Just a few chords on the banjo that was all he knew  
But in the eyes of a child, man his fingers flew  
I practiced and I practiced til I got it right  
Packed up everything and just took off one night  
  
I made it from the beer joints to the Opry stage  
He said the only difference is what you're gettin' paid  
He didn't care that everybody knew my name  
He said it's all for nothin' if you don't stay the same  
  
But when he died the preacher cried and said he's the lucky one  
He's walkin' hand in hand in hand with God's only son  
My faith and common sense tell me the preacher's right  
But I'd love to hear the banjo ring for me tonight  
  
And I will honor my father with these words I write down  
As long as I remember him he'll always be around  
And the pain of losin' him cuts like a Randall knife  
I learned a few chords on the banjo as the key to life  
  
And the pain of losin' him cuts like a Randall knife  
I learned a few chords on the banjo as the key to life

I've got a secret I keep in my heart  
A secret that sure makes me smile  
And I've got a feeling deep down in my soul  
That I haven't felt in a while  
I've found somebody that really does love me  
And I know that she'll always stay  
I'm the luckiest guy in the world  
'Cause my heart feels this way  
  
We watch old movies and cry at the endings  
And get lost in each other's eyes  
We hold hands when we're walking and  
Spend all night talking and make love as the sun starts to rise  
She's found somebody that really does love her  
And she knows that I'll always stay  
I'm the luckiest guy in the world  
'Cause her heart feels this way  
  
We share the same hopes  
We dream the same dreams  
Oh lifelong companions I'd say  
I'm the luckiest guy in the world  
'Cause our hearts feel this way  
I'm the luckiest guy in the world  
'Cause our hearts feel this way

Why do I, choose the things I choose,  
Why do I, always find some lame excuse,  
Why do I, not realize what I could do,  
Oh, I wish I knew the reason why,  
  
Why do you, get that sad look on your face,  
Why do you, pull away from my embrace,  
Why do you, see all my faults and my mistakes  
Oh, I wish you knew the reason why,  
  
Why do we, treat each other like we do,  
It's like we never even try,  
Why can't we, get back to the love we knew,  
Oh why oh baby why,  
  
Why do we, have to play those same old games,  
Why do we, run away from who's to blame,  
Can't they see, to lose this love would be ashame,  
Oh I wish we knew the reason why,  
Oh I wish we knew the reason why.

You're so close to tellin' me you're leaving  
Packin' up your things and leavin' town  
If you can walk away the rest is easy  
Once you cut the strings that tie you down  
  
Just look me in the eye and say it's over  
Just tell me you don't want me around  
Once you say goodbye, it's gone forever  
Once you cut the strings that tie you down  
  
There's no way I can picture me without you  
I still think of you in your wedding gown  
If I have to give you up, may God be with you  
Once you cut the strings that tie you down

  
Oh here I sit with my first glass of whiskey  
Wondering where I went wrong  
How I wish she was still right here with me  
I long to hear all those old country songs  
  
Like old Hank Williams when he'd sing about lonesome  
And Hag about misery and gin  
If the jukebox would play Patsy's 'Crazy'  
Then I could let this new heartache begin  
  
The band just quit and the lovers are leaving  
And the bartender said it's closing time  
Oh I wonder if she's having trouble sleeping  
And if those songs keep on runnin' through her mind  
  
Like 'Crazy Arms' and 'A-11'  
The 'Lovers Blues' we're 'Together Again'  
Why baby, why must you and 'I Fall To Pieces'  
It's time to let this new heartache begin  
Why baby, why must you and 'I Fall To Pieces'  
It's time to let this new heartache begin  
  

Painted as the victim  
He said you caused it all  
Lying to convince 'em  
So you would take the fall  
You walked out with nothin'  
Hopin' for some peace of mind  
The pain is almost over  
The hurt is nearly gone  
No more lookin' over your shoulder  
It's time to carry on  
The scars won't last forever  
The truth will take their place  
Angry words will be forgotten  
Contempt will fade away  
The promise of tomorrow  
It will always remain  
The pain is almost over  
The hurt is nearly gone  
No more lookin' over your shoulder  
It's time to carry on  
The promise of tomorrow  
'T will always remain  
The pain is almost over  
The hurt is nearly gone  
No more lookin' over your shoulder  
It's time to carry on  
It's time to carry on  

No one ever told me  
During all those tears I cried  
That one day you would hold me  
I just kept hoping inside  
  
True love was waiting  
True love would find me in time  
True love was waiting  
Your love would finally be mine  
  
No one ever showed me  
Such care and tenderness  
Baby you know me  
And what moves me the best  
  
It's true love waiting  
It's true love making up for lost time  
It's true love waiting  
Your love it's finally mine  
  
And I can't erase these lines on my face  
But I'd turn back time if I could  
But all the years wanting, the desperate longing,  
Are maybe what makes this so good  
  
True love, waiting  
True love that found us in time  
True love is waiting  
Your love is finally mine  
  
True love is waiting  
Your love is finally mine

[Chorus]  
You better turn me loose  
Turn me loose you know that I can't stay  
You better turn me loose  
Well turn me loose you know I'll make it anyway  
  
Well why don't you tell me  
Just what's goin' on  
Both of us lyin' here  
And we both know it's wrong  
So why don't you let me  
Why don't you leave it alone  
And don't keep hangin' on to a love that's dead and gone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well you can't see it's over  
That's really a shame  
Well our love didn't make it  
No one's to blame  
So why don't we say goodbye  
Why don't we just say we're through  
And I'll be on my way  
And I'll get by without you  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Turn me loose you know I'll make it anyway

There's a man drinkin' whiskey in a barroom  
He's nursin' a broken heart  
There's a woman at a table  
With her own brand of misery  
Cryin' in the dark.  
  
[Chorus]  
Will two hearts make on tonight  
Will somebody lost fond someone who's lost  
Will strangers info comfort  
In the cold neon light  
Will two hearts make one tonight.  
  
Oh, there's just a waitress between them  
They're so close to finding their dreams  
They're just one dance away  
From easing the pain  
Of coming apart at the seams.  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Will two hears make one tonight

It's 6:05 on Sunday mornin'  
And I was supposed to've left for Memphis late last night  
But I stopped at one of them old highway places  
And 'cause I did I'll sleep in Tarren County Jail tonight  
  
Well I started out tonight with good intentions  
But I ended up gettin' sidways drinkin' wine  
Well the last thing I remember we was rollin'  
And something hit my head and knocked me from my conscious mind  
  
[Chorus]  
And I'm a victim of life's circumstances  
Well I was raised around bar rooms and Friday night dances  
Singin' them old country songs  
And half the time ending up some place I don't belong  
  
I said, "Jailer, hey, what y'all got me charged with?"  
Well he looked at me and halfway closed one eye  
Well he said, "To mean to say you don't remember  
Cuttin' up some fool with that bone handled knife?"  
  
[Chorus: x2]

A little girl was crying for her mama and her daddy  
She couldn't understand why they were gone  
She never knew the danger of talking to a stranger  
Now the girl can't find her way back home  
A little boy went walking down to the corner market  
To buy a loaf of bread and an ice cream cone  
He never knew the danger of talking to a stranger  
Now the boy can't find the way back home  
Too many kids are missing, is anybody listening?  
Won't you be the children's eyes they're all alone  
The hardest part's not knowing  
Where they are or where they're going  
Won't you help the children find  
The way back home  
The faces on milk cartons thrown away and soon forgotten  
What if one of those sweet kids was your very own  
Tonight those kids are weeping while yours are safely sleeping  
Won't you help the children find the way back home  
Too many kids are missing, is anybody listening?  
Won't you be the children's eyes they're all alone  
The hardest part's not knowing  
Where they are or where they're going  
Won't you help the children find  
The way back home  
Won't you help the children find  
The way back home  

Today at work I overheard a name  
I knew it wasn't yours but it touched me just the same  
It felt so good to have you in my mind  
I guess I'm the sentimental kind  
  
I wonder who you became  
Did you change the world  
Or play the game  
We came so close to love back then  
We could have been  
  
You were so brave when I was shy  
I made you laugh when something made you cry  
And I don't think we ever said goodbye  
Now I'll always wonder why  
  
I wonder who you became  
Did you change the world  
Or play the game  
We came so close to love back then  
We could have been  
  
A time or two  
I thought about calling  
But something always gets in the way  
Maybe I'm afraid you'd really answer  
What would I say to you  
  
I wonder who you became  
Did you change the world  
Or play the game  
We came so close to love back then  
We could have been  
  
We could have been

Have you ever been down to Texas  
Down around San Antone  
They love to go all night and treat you right  
And party till the cows come home  
  
I love it when the let their hair down  
And dance real close to you  
You know I'm a sucker baby for what the cowgirls do  
What the cowgirls do  
  
They ain't no different up in Oklahoma  
They ain't afraid to stay up til dawn  
They love to cut a run and chug a lug  
Longnecks til their money's all gone  
  
I love it when the let their hair down  
And dance real close to you  
You know I'm a sucker baby for what the cowgirls do  
What the cowgirls do  
  
There's cowgirls all across the country  
From Baton Rouge to Bangor Maine  
It ain't hard to see they'll be the death of me  
They're gonna drive my little heart insane  
  
I love it when the let their hair down  
And dance real close to you  
You know I'm a sucker baby for what the cowgirls do  
What the cowgirls do  

Sometimes this old world gets to me  
And I sure can be a jerk  
But you always see the best in me  
God knows you've seen the worst  
  
You know when to let me be  
Pull yourself real close to me  
And how to take my breath away  
  
You don't care who's right or wrong  
I know whose side you're on  
It's more than the love that we make  
It's what you don't say  
  
Man, I should have been the death of me  
I sure can run it in the ground  
When you come lie here next to me  
Girl, you bring me back around  
  
You know when to let me be  
Pull yourself real close to me  
And how to take my breath away  
  
You don't care who's right or wrong  
I know whose side you're on  
It's more than the love that we make  
It's what you don't say  
  
You know when to let me be  
Pull yourself real close to me  
And how to take my breath away  
  
You don't care who's right or wrong  
I know whose side you're on  
It's more than the love that we make  
It's what you don't say  
It's what you don't say  
It's what you don't say

You read the business page  
See how you did today  
You live up on the hill  
You've got a view that kills  
Never wonder why  
  
[Bridge]  
After you've counted everything you saved  
Do you ever hit your knees and pray?  
You know there's gonna be a judgment day  
So what will you say?  
  
[Chorus]  
No matter what you make  
All that you can take  
Is what you give away  
What you give away  
  
There's people on the street  
Ain't got enough to eat  
You just shake your head  
The measure of a man is one who lends a hand  
That's what my father said  
  
After you've counted everything you saved  
Do you ever hit your knees and pray?  
You know there's gonna be a judgment day  
So what will you say?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's what you give away  
  
After you've counted everything you saved  
Do you ever hit your knees and pray?  
You know there's gonna be a judgment day  
So what will you say?  
  
No matter what you make  
All that you can take  
Is what you give away  
  
You know it's not too late  
It's all for Heaven's sake  
What you give away  
What you give away  
What you give away

Before the tears I've cried  
Have even dried  
She'll be with him  
They'll look in each other's eyes  
And with her lips still warm with lies  
She'll kiss him  
  
And though she knows she's wrong  
She just keeps on  
Keepin' me hangin' on  
Tell me  
  
[Chorus]  
What's a man to do  
When the one he's promised to  
Finds somebody new  
Should I just stand by  
Watch the love I've lived for die  
Lord I wish I knew  
Tell me what's a man to do  
  
Maybe I'll make a stand  
Or should I just wash my hands  
Of her forever  
But I've never been alone  
Except for here at home  
When they're together  
  
And though I know it's wrong  
I let her go on  
Keepin' me hangin' on  
  
[Chorus]

Baby, you need to put that bottle down  
Put that gun back in the drawer  
I hear your man's been out there runnin' 'round  
You're hell-bent to even up the score  
  
Don't let the devil get you by the throat  
You pull that trigger, girl, that's all she wrote  
Satan's waitin' for you down the road  
Oh, which way will you go?  
  
Your hands are shakin' and your knees are weak  
Pistol pointed at the door  
You're tired of wearin' bruises on your cheek  
Bein' treated like a whore  
  
Don't let the devil get you by the throat  
You pull that trigger, girl, that's all she wrote  
Well, Satan's waitin' for you down the road  
Oh, which way will you go?  
  
And don't let the devil get you by the throat  
You pull that trigger, girl, that's all she wrote  
Well, Satan's waitin' for you down the road  
Oh, which way will you go?  
  
Oh, Heaven only knows  
  
Baby, you need to put that bottle down  
Put that gun back in the drawer

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas  
Just like the ones I used to know  
Where the treetops glisten,  
and children listen  
To hear sleigh bells in the snow  
  
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas  
With every Christmas card I write  
May your days be merry and bright  
And may all your Christmases be white  
  
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas  
With every Christmas card I write  
May your days be merry and bright  
And may all your Christmases be white

I wake up one morning and it's passed you by  
You don't know when and you don't know why  
I feel like an old memory hangin' round  
And man, we've got to face it, it's a young man's town  
I knew this day was comin' all along  
Some why bitch an' moan and say they done you wrong  
Just teach 'em what you know and pass it on down  
'Cause man, you gotta face it, it's a young man's town  
It's a young man's town  
Full of young man's dreams  
And all God's children gotta learn to spread their wings  
And sometimes you gotta stand back  
And watch 'em burn it to the ground  
Even though you built it, it's a young man's town  
You always seem to be the last to know  
Man, that's just the way that the story goes  
There's nothin' you can do when the fields have turned brown  
An' man, you gotta face it, it's a young man's town  
It's a young man's town  
Full of young man's dreams  
And all God's children gotta learn to spread their wings  
And sometimes you gotta stand back  
And watch 'em burn it to the ground  
Even though you built it, it's a young man's town  
Sometimes you gotta stand back  
And watch 'em burn it to the ground  
Even though you built it, it's a young man's town  
It's a young man's town
