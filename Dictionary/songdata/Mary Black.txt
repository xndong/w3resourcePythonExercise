Adam's at the window staring at the apple trees on fire  
Waiting for the windfall that brings the smile of kings and their desire  
Door blows in behind him, a floral pattern, summer dress so gay  
Burning in the sunlight, too late to wait, for darkness won't delay  
To steal her cherry lips away  
For while the careless tongues of sunlight slowly trickle down  
The curve of hips, her fingertips, in kissing sips we drown  
In kissing sips we drown  
  
And Adam will have his way  
Adam will have his way  
  
Adam's on the island, living in the land of love  
Shadows lurk around him, drunk on the royal jelly of pure love  
Full and ripe, the fruit hang, for when the prince arrives he will want more  
And more and more he will drink from the canvas cup  
The son of a swan will then loose his plumera  
And he will wear a new age suit and haunt the joints in town  
And play a silver magic flute and call his lovers down  
And call his lovers down  
  
And Adam will have his way  
Adam will have his way  
Will have his way  
  
Adam's at the easel painting in the wrinkles and the gray  
Waiting for November, easy with the darkness of the day  
Smiles a tear of gladness, and Adam's at the window once again  
He's burning in the sunlight, too late to wait, for darkness won't delay  
To steal her cherry lips away  
For while the careless tongues of sunlight slowly trickle down  
The curve of hips, her fingertips, in kissing sips we drown  
In kissing sips we drown  
  
And Adam will have his way  
  
Adam's at the window

Hey little brother the winds of the world  
Have ruffled your soft and weakened wings  
And though I can't hold you as I look into your eyes  
I can see the film that disappointment brings  
I know it's rained upon your childhood dreams  
The games you've been playing  
Weren't quite what they seemed  
How can I tell you don't bang your head against the wall  
The wall I've been banging and praying might fall  
  
[Chorus]  
Your time will come on another day  
And your dreams will flame and in the fire play  
On another day  
  
I know it's hard for you to understand  
There are no flying angels come to lend a hand  
No smiling faces lined for you to meet  
It looks like that in twisted glass  
From the kind side of the street  
  
[Chorus]  
Repeat 1st verse  
[Chorus]

As I leave behind Neidin  
It's like purple splashed on green  
My soul is strangely fed  
Through the winding hills ahead  
And she plays a melody  
On wind and streams for me  
Won't you remember?  
Won't you remember?  
Won't you remember me?  
And we wind and climb and fall  
Like the greatest waltz of all  
Float across the floor  
Her sweet breath outside the door  
And it's time that I was gone  
Cross the silver tear  
Won't you remember?  
Won't you remember?  
Won't you remember me?  
Won't you remember?  
Won't you remember?  
Won't you remember me?  
As I leave behind Neidin  
In the hall where we have been  
Rhododendrons in your hair  
In the mountain scented air  
I still feel her spirit song  
Cross the silver tear  
Won't you remember?  
Won't you remember?  
Won't you remember me?  
Won't you remember?  
Won't you remember?  
Won't you remember me?  
I leave behind Neidin  

Babes in the wood walking through' snow  
Big bad wolf at the window  
Not much choice in the matter now  
Some must lead some must follow  
  
Touch can mean distance to some people  
Touch can mean prison or be like a cage  
I always thought that life could be more simple  
Specially in this day and age  
  
Babes in the wood walking through' snow  
Big bad wolf at the window  
Not much choice in the matter now  
Some must lead some must follow  
  
They got the time they got the need  
The world's getting weird the wolf's running free  
But that's another story this their story  
  
Babes in the wood eager and keen  
Soft as the fern underneath them  
Wet to the skin from their own hot glow  
No more wolf at the window  
  
Touch can mean distance to some people  
Touch can mean I own you forever and a day  
If only life could be more simple  
Specially in this day and age  
  
Babes in the wood walking through' snow  
Big bad wolf at the window  
Not much choice in the matter now  
Some must lead some must follow  
  
But touch can be a blessing to other people  
Touch can bring blossom to things that decay  
I think life should be that simple  
Specially in this day and age  
  
Babes in the wood walking through' snow  
Big bad wolf at the window  
Not much choice in the matter now  
Some must lead some must follow

Long long before I put a face on love  
The one thing I knew was that  
Like anything love can surprise you  
One kiss and you brought me a lifetime  
Do you know what that means to me  
You give me the answer to whether I bleed  
Deep in the darkest night oh, I wake you  
To tell you I know that life is so beautiful with you  
  
And time will tell  
What hurt and what I felt  
This open road  
Is long and beautiful  
  
For every minute you need me I want to need you  
In every fear life is brand new  
Deep in the darkest night oh, I wake you  
And tell you I know that life is so beautiful with you  
  
And time will tell  
What hurt and what I felt  
This open road  
Is long and beautiful  
  
And time will tell  
What hurt and what I felt  
This open road  
Is long and beautiful  
  
And time will tell  
What hurt and what I felt  
This open road  
Is long and beautiful  
  
And time will tell

The day won't open it's eyes  
The heavens above must be sick  
I'm stood at the windows since five  
All decked out for the trip  
  
Hey Hey I'm dying to meet with you  
Hey Hey I'm living to speak with you  
Hey Hey I'm waiting to meet you baby  
Hey Hey Hey  
  
Chorus  
  
Big trip to Portland  
No more cooling my heels  
Big trip to Portland  
My soul shall be healed  
  
The master's out of my reach  
He wanders around in the rain  
Today is all that I seek  
Today when I hold you again  
Hey Hey  
  
Chorus  
I take the prize I win the day  
You say you love me all the way  
I kill the pain that drags you down  
You take us on from town to town  
  
The sun's burning all through' the day  
It's doing the best it can do  
I came with my bucket and spade  
I came with the same things as you  
  
Chorus  
Big trip to Portland  
No more cooling my heels  
Big trip to Portland  
My soul shall be healed

Remember when we walked on hills of heather  
Singing weaving mystical rings  
Now in a while my precious child  
You wil unfurl your wings  
And I'll have lost what I believed  
Had promised everything  
But before you go my friend, my kind companion  
Listen to this song I sing  
  
Then go in peace and grow in grace and goodness  
Know that you have nothing to fear  
And dry your eyes my little one  
And let there be no tears  
Send me a dream from away beyond  
I promise I shall hear  
Oh beautifull beloved soul companion  
Thank you for those beautifull years  
  
And heaven hold and watch your way forever  
May your every dream com true  
Forgive all wrong, always be strong  
And do what you must do  
You stand before this open door  
And you must now go through  
My precious friend, my own my sweet companion  
Bless the road that carries you  
My precious friend, myu own my sweet companion  
Bless the road that carries you

A tall tree turn and face the west  
Oh we're running with the wind  
A high clifftop we're waiting with the rest  
For this journey to begin  
Chorus  
But these broken wings won't fly  
These broken wings won't fly  
These broken wings won't fly at all  
And oh how we laugh but maybe we should crawl  
And ask to be excused  
We shout loudly, have answers to it all  
Oh but we have been refused  
Chorus  
Girl child  
You're dancing with the stream  
Growing with the silver trees  
Your young questions  
You ask me what it means  
Oh but I am not at ease  
Chorus  

Baby every cloud has a silver lining  
Baby every dog really has his day  
And it matters to me to see you smiling  
Why don't you blow all your cares away  
Yesterday is gone and will be forgotten  
And today is where every new day starts  
Got to be free as the leaves in the autumn  
You may be sad but it will never last.  
Chorus  
Mabye by the evening we'll be laughing  
Just wait and see all the changes there'll be  
By the time it gets dark  

The letter stopped in a minor key  
A Christmas card that you drew for me  
Done by the hand that I knew so well  
Disguised the message that you could not tell  
  
I see you bent above your potter's wheel  
The piece you've throwing is the piece you feel  
The softest colour and an eye so true  
For cups and bowls that are shaped like you  
  
Chorus  
You work in porcelain cut by wire  
Now as ever lovers walk through fire  
When we were breaking we made no sound  
The pieces almost touching on the ground  
  
And now your silence says there's someone there  
She stands behind you as she strokes your hair  
How does she hold you like a long lost friend  
Or are you like me on your own again  
  
And so I write you in a minor key  
Wondering if there's something left for me  
I'm only writing so that I can sleep  
I never found another love as deep

I have written this song  
For you to take with you  
When you go away  
Something to sing and slowly swing to  
On your colder days  
I have made a start  
With a verse and a chorus  
The rest I leave to you  
And when next I see your smiling face  
We might sing it right through  
Chorus  
I'll be your sweetheart always  
And I'll love the memories of the diamond days  
I'll keep a candle burning  
'till we sing again the diamond days  
If the words don't rhyme  
Then I will forgive you  
That won't be the crime  
But the staring space  
Upon the page  
That might look like mine  
I have made a start  
With a verse and a chorus  
The rest I'll leave to you  
And when next I see your smiling face  
We might sing it right through  
Chorus  

Chorus  
With your dark hair in the donegal breeze,  
Bringing me softly and sweetly to the ground,  
But, there's madness in the sycamore trees,  
And there's no salvation to be found.  
Right now the only thing that my mind ever holds,  
Are long dark silences or screaming that explodes,  
Burning rocking beds with visions of a land,  
Long dark tunnels, questions and calm,  
But, with you, you know I have no doubts,  
And fear will have no sting,  
With your brilliant eyes and your lost and broken wing,  
My head upon your shoulder as you take me in your arms,  
Continents will crumble, we will find no harm.  
Chorus  
With your dark hair in the donegal breeze,  
Bringing me softly and sweetly to the ground,  
But, there's madness in the sycamore trees,  
And there's no salvation to be found.  
Well I'll brace myself against the dark, endeavour to go on,  
No matter how long it takes, and even though I might be wrong,  
And I will ask a little favour of whatever God I find,  
And I will come back for you darling, when I find some peace of mind.  
Well I don't know about tomorrow, it will be here and gone,  
I don't know about tonight, it'll be too long,  
Sometimes I think I'm dying, and I don't care how,  
All I know is that I want you, and I want you here and now.  
Chorus  
With your dark hair in the donegal breeze,  
Bringing me softly and sweetly to the ground,  
But, there's madness in the sycamore trees,  
And there's no salvation to be found.  

I'm giving up on tv it's not making sense  
Gotta trust ourselves it's the last line of defence  
Spinning into space running out of time  
Gathering together all the useful things we find  
Chorus  
So don't say okay and be half-hearted  
I'm afraid that this feeling goes on  
Sacrifice the world face a killing sun  
You gotta get it all together it'll bring us all undone  
We're running up hills that we already climbed  
Over the top and falling down the other side  
Chorus  
The ghosts are at the window they're again tonight  
Looking in on us so we have got to get it right  
We've walking on their bones everywhere we go  
Spirits in the wind and the memories in the stones  
Chorus  
How we gonna get the healing done?  

Oh, the smartest packet you can find,  
Ah he, ah ho, are you most done?  
Is the fair "Rosalind" in the Blackwall line!  
So the clear the track, let the bulgine run,  
To my aye rig a jig in the low back car,  
Ah he, ha ho, are you most done?  
With Eliza Lee all on my knee,  
So clear the track, let the bulgine run.  
  
The fair "Rosalind" one bright summer's day,  
Ah he, ah ho, are you most done?  
Went sailing away far out over the bay,  
So the clear the track, let the bulgine run,  
To my aye rig a jig in the low back car,  
Ah he, ha ho, are you most done?  
With Eliza Lee all on my knee,  
So clear the track, let the bulgine run.  
  
The tiller one hand firmly grasp'd,  
Ah he, ah ho, are you most done?  
And Eliza's waist by the other was clasp'd,  
So the clear the track, let the bulgine run,  
To my aye rig a jig in the low back car,  
Ah he, ha ho, are you most done?  
With Eliza Lee all on my knee,  
So clear the track, let the bulgine run.  
  
Oh the day was fine, the wind was free,  
Ah he, ah ho, are you most done?  
And Eliza Lee sat there on my knee,  
So the clear the track, let the bulgine run,  
To my aye rig a jig in the low back car,  
Ah he, ha ho, are you most done?  
With Eliza Lee all on my knee,  
So clear the track, let the bulgine run.  
  
Oh, Eliza Lee all on my knee,  
Ah he, ah ho, are you most done?  
Was as pretty a sight as any could see!  
So the clear the track, let the bulgine run,  
To my aye rig a jig in the low back car,  
Ah he, ha ho, are you most done?  
With Eliza Lee all on my knee,  
So clear the track, let the bulgine run.  
  
Oh, I said, "My dear, will you be mine?"  
Ah he, ah ho, are you most done?  
Her answer was sweeter than sweetest of wine,  
So the clear the track, let the bulgine run,  
To my aye rig a jig in the low back car,  
Ah he, ha ho, are you most done?  
With Eliza Lee all on my knee,  
So clear the track, let the bulgine run.  
  
Oh the smartest packet you can find,  
Ah he, ah ho, are you most done?  
Is the fair "Rosalind" in the Blackwall line  
So the clear the track, let the bulgine run,  
To my aye rig a jig in the low back car,  
Ah he, ha ho, are you most done?  
With Eliza Lee all on my knee,  
So clear the track, let the bulgine run.

From the corner of my eye I see a tear rolling down  
At the time I couldn't tell whose tear it was  
If it was mine I should be glad  
That I still function in this cage  
But if it's yours it only makes me more lost  
To see a tear rolling down  
To see a tear rolling down  
This is the last call for ellis island  
These are the last words I'm ever gonna hear you say  
So goodbye, babe  
Goodbye, babe.  
I hear sweethearts whisper their undying love  
Above the noise on the quay their voices rise  
They must have something so strong in the face of such change  
That they can promise and promise all night  
Oh, their undying love, hear their undying love  
This is the last call for ellis island  
These are the last words I'm ever gonna hear you say  
So goodbye, babe  
Goodbye, babe.  
Oh, what you wouldn't give to be down on the pier once again  
Far away from the cries of this war-weary horde  
Time up there in the clouds must be hard to endure  
When your heart's unsure  
It's like a knife in my gut knowing you're taking leave  
I feel I'm sentenced to a death without appeal  
I can pretend it's all a dream  
And what I'm seeing will disappear  
But the end I can see is all too real  
Knowing you're taking leave  
Knowing you're taking leave  
This is the last call for ellis island  
These are the last words I'm ever gonna hear you say  
So goodbye, babe  
Goodbye, babe  

Farewell, farewell to you who would hear  
You lonely travelers all  
The cold north winds will blow again  
The winding road does call.  
  
And will you never return to see  
Your bruised and beaten sons  
Oh I would, I would if welcome I were  
For they loathe me every one.  
  
And will you never cut the cloth  
Nor drink the light to be  
And can you never swear a year  
To anyone but he.  
  
No I will never cut the cloth  
Nor drink the light to be  
But I'll swear a year to he who lies  
Asleep alongside of me.  
  
Farewell, farewell to you who would hear  
You lonely travelers all  
The cold north winds will blow again  
The winding road does call.

It was one of those days  
When to shine was of no value  
One of those days  
When the language had no grace  
We were miles apart  
And I stood there with my head spinning  
Just another poor soul  
Trying hard not to lose faith  
We had it engraved  
We had the key to a union  
But you wanted more  
So we both kept on losing  
Fat valley of pain  
Fat valley of pain inside  
And this pain will not end  
'cause loving you is what I was made for  
You were like one of those rainbows  
We glimpse for a few seconds  
One of those dreams  
That could last for a life long  
Now I'm quizzing myself  
And it's always the same question  
Is it wrong to believe  
When the feeling so so strong?  
We had engraved  
We had the key to a union  
But you wanted more  
So we both kept on losing  
It's an ill-kept secret  
That something here's going wrong  
Oh but my helpless feelings  
They keep on leading me on  
Fat valley of pain  
Fat valley of pain inside  
And this pain will not end  
'cause loving you is what I was made for  
Fat valley of pain  

If we leave here today  
We could be a thousand miles away  
Take to that road, see how far it goes  
And on that great ocean road  
Oh the country's in our bones  
All the trouble that you know  
Empties out as you go  
  
Oh walk with me, talk with me  
Tell me your stories  
I'll do my best to understand you  
You're flesh and blood, flesh and blood  
Don't refuse me your love  
More than words can express  
More than wealth or success  
  
Oh there's a thousand things to do  
So let's start here with me and you  
All the pain that you feel  
All the hurt that seems so real  
  
Oh come on, walk with me, talk with me  
Tell me your stories  
I'll do my very best to understand you  
You're flesh and blood  
  
You can't go on holding back the flooding river  
Keeping all that fear inside  
I understand how trouble haunts you  
It haunts me, too  
Yes, and I do know how you feel  
  
Oh there's a thousand things to do  
So let's start here with me and you  
Gonna take a little time  
Let's see what we can find  
  
Oh come on, walk with me, talk with me  
Tell me your stories  
I'll do my best to understand you  
  
Oh won't you walk with me, talk with me  
Tell me your stories  
I'll do my very best to understand you  
You're flesh and blood, flesh and blood  
You're flesh and blood

Gabriel Gabriel  
Open you heart and mine as well  
Oh Gabriel Gabriel  
Save this heart from hell  
  
Heaven knows I love you  
And heaven knows how true  
I'd be for you  
  
People have their failings  
And I know that I've got mine  
I know I've been ungrateful  
I know I've been unkind  
  
Gabriel Gabriel  
Open you heart and mine as well  
Oh come on Gabriel Gabriel  
Save this heart from hell  
  
Down into the valleys  
And out across the sea  
Our dreams go  
Caught up in a loving  
So much stronger than we knew  
That could tear our world apart  
Or with some fate just pull us through  
  
Gabriel oh Gabriel  
Open you heart and mine as well  
Gabriel Gabriel  
Save this heart from hell  
  
Time will wait for no one  
And time will take it's toll  
And we'll grow old  
Weary from the fighting  
Worn out from a war  
Where no one can surrender  
Or wants to fight anymore  
  
Gabriel Gabriel  
Open you heart and mine as well  
Gabriel Gabriel  
Save this heart from hell  
  
Gabriel Gabriel  
Open you heart and mine as well  
Oh Gabriel Gabriel  
This heart's in hell  
  
Gabriel Gabriel  
Open you heart and mine as well  
Oh Gabriel Gabriel  
This heart's in hell

Them that's got shall get  
Them that's not shall lose  
So the Bible said but it still is news  
Mama may have, Papa may have  
But God bless the child that's got his own  
That's got his own  
Rich relations give  
Crust of bread and such  
You can help yourself  
But don't take too much  
Mama may have, Papa may have  
But God bless the child that's got his own  
That's got his own  
Money, you've got lots of friends  
Crowding round the door  
When you're gone, spending ends  
They don't come no more  
Yes, the strong gets more  
While the weak ones fade  
Empty pockets don't ever make the grade  
Mama may have, Papa may have  
But God bless the child that's got his own  
That's got his own  
Money, you've got lots of friends  
Crowding round the door  
Money's gone, and spending ends  
They don't come no more  
Mama may have, Papa may have  
But God bless the child that's got his own  
That's got his own  
But God bless the child that's got his own  
That's got his own

There is a lighthouse in the harbor  
Giving guidance with its light  
But I had no one to return to  
As I wander through life  
From the first time that I saw you  
Standing silent by the shore  
I knew my search was over  
And I would look for love no more  
Deep in the waters of love I am falling, sinking like a stone  
Deep in my heart I can hear love calling  
Going once, going twice, going gone  
Going once, going twice, going gone  
There is a ship on the horizon  
Making its way against the wind  
And from the place where I stand watching  
I swear my ship is coming in  
Deep in the waters of love I am falling, sinking like a stone  
Deep in my heart I can hear love calling  
Going once, going twice, going gone  
Going once, going twice, going gone  
Deep in the waters of love I am falling, sinking like a stone  
Deep in my heart I can hear love calling  
Going once, going twice, going gone  
Going once, going twice, going gone  

Walkin' along golden mile with a soldier's twirl  
I must be the luckiest soul in the whole wide world  
Oh foolish thing, here I go again  
  
There's no faith more innocent than blind faith, and that's all I've got  
So I'm scaling the walls of my dreams, ready or not  
Oh foolish thing, here I go again  
  
Don't be afraid, darling,  
No need to be afraid, darling  
You don't have to be afraid from now on  
It's just the way, darling,  
We get delayed, darling  
But we won't be delayed from now on  
  
I know no power on earth nor up above  
That would alter the way things are, you are my love  
Yes, you're my pride and joy on the golden mile  
  
If only it could be captured  
how I feel for you  
And if I could just freeze it, I feel I'd never be untrue  
Oh foolish thing, here I go  
Here I go again  
  
Don't be afraid, darling,  
No need to be afraid, darling  
You don't have to be afraid from now on  
It's just the way, darling,  
We get delayed, darling  
But we won't be delayed from now on  
  
I know no power on earth nor up above  
That would alter the way things are, you are my love  
You're my pride and joy, my pride and joy  
Yes, you're my pride and joy on the golden mile  
  
Walkin' along golden mile with a soldier's twirl

I looked into a mirror made of lines  
With tiny symbols here and there to make the image mine  
A woman stood and painted and showed me what to find  
The different parts, the fire, the air, and where my life would climb  
And where it joins another, and what would always bind  
  
It's a golden thread to hold you all of my days  
Hold my head against you now and for always  
Sewn me up, shown us a long, long time  
Makes you my life, makes you my life  
  
The moving finger writes and goes away  
I'm weighed upon a balance here and I'm told that I can stay  
The kettle heats, the water speaks up, says I'm not alone  
My whole life is a tapestry and hanging in my home  
And here it joins another by what will always bind  
  
It's a golden thread to hold you all of my days  
Hold my head against you now and for always  
Sewn me up, shown us a long, long time  
Makes you my life, makes you my life  
  
And when you looked, your angel flew away  
And what it meant was your protection's gone another day  
And what has come to change you, and have you come what may  
Is fashioned by an old triangle, green as April haze  
Blue is just a color, but blue is here to stay  
  
It's a golden thread to hold you all of my days  
Hold my head against you now and for always  
Sewn me up, shown us a long, long time  
Makes you my life  
  
It's a golden thread to hold you all of my days  
Hold my head against you now and for always  
Sewn me up, shown us a long, long time  
Makes you my life, makes you my life  
  
Makes you my life

Kind friends and companions, come join me in rhyme  
Come lift up your voices in chorus with mine  
Let us drink and be merry, all grief to refrain  
For we may and might never all meet here again  
  
Here's a health to the company and one to my lass  
Let us drink and be merry all out of one glass  
Let us drink and be merry, all grief to refrain  
For we may and might never all meet here again  
  
Here's a health to the dear lass that I love so well  
Her style and her beauty, sure none can excel  
There's a smile upon her countenance as she sits on my knee  
Sure there's no one in in this wide world as happy as we  
  
Our ship lies at harbor, she's ready to dock  
I hope she's safe landed without any shock  
If ever we should meet again by land or by sea  
I will always remember your kindness to me

Traveling at night, the headlights were bright  
And we'd been up many an hour  
And all through my brain  
Came the refrain  
Of home and it's warming fire  
  
[Chorus]  
And Home  
Sings me of sweet things  
My life there has it's own wings  
To fly over the mountains  
Though I'm standing still  
  
The people I've seen  
They come in between  
The cities of tiring life  
The trains come and go,  
But inside you know  
The struggle will soon be a fight  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Traveling at night,  
The headlights were bright.  
But soon the sun came through the trees  
Around the next bend  
The flowers will send  
The sweet scene of home in the breeze  
  
[Chorus]

Come all ye maids that live at a distance  
Many a miles from off your swain  
Come and assist me this very moment  
For to pass away some time  
Singing sweetly and completely  
Songs of pleasure and of love  
For my heart is with them all together  
Though I live not where I love  
  
When I sleep I dream about you  
When I wake I find no rest  
For every moment thinking of you  
My heart affixed in your breast  
Although far distance may be assistance  
From my mind his love to remove  
Yet my heart is with him all together  
Though I live not where I love  
  
All the world shall be one religion  
Living things shall cease to die  
If ever I prove false to my jewel  
Or any way my love deny  
The world shall change and be most strange  
If ever I my mind remove  
For my heart is with him all together  
Though I live not where I love  
  
So farewell lads and farewell lasses  
Now I think I've got my choice  
I will away to yonder mountain  
Where I think I hear his voice  
And if he calls then I will follow  
Though the world it is so wide  
For my heart is with him all together  
Thought I live not where I love  
  
(repeat first verse)

He said darling I'm in love with you mind  
The way you care for me it's so kind  
Love to see you again wish I had more time  
He was laughing as he brushed my cheek  
Why don't you call me baby maybe next week  
Promise now cross your heart and hope to die  
  
Chorus  
  
But I misunderstood  
But I misunderstood  
But I misunderstood  
I thought he was saying good luck  
He was saying goodbye  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
Things I tried to put shine in his eyes  
Wire wheels and shimmering things  
Wild nights when the whole world seemed to fly  
He said the thing that's so unique  
When we're together we don't have to speak  
We'll always be such good friends you and I  
  
Chorus  
  
But I misunderstood  
But I misunderstood  
But I misunderstood  
I thought he was saying good luck  
He was saying goodbye  
  
Repeart Chorus

When times are hard and friends are few  
And you need someone to help you through  
Just call my name and I'll come running to your side  
Don't be afraid don't be afraid  
  
I will be there  
When you are lost in the night  
No where to run  
I will be there  
Don't be afraid don't be afraid  
  
When morning comes and nothing's changed  
And the world around plays the same old game  
Just call on me and I will ease your lonely heart  
Don't be afraid don't be afraid  
  
I will be there  
When you are lost in the night  
No where to turn  
I will be there  
Don't be afraid don't be afraid  
I will be there  
When every one that you believe still lets you down  
I will be there  
Don't be afraid don't be afraid  
  
'Cause I will be there don't be afraid  
I will be there don't be afraid  
I will be there  
  
When morning comes and nothing's changed  
And the world around plays the same old game  
When everyone still lets you down  
I will be there  
  
When morning comes and friends are few  
You need someone you need someone to help you through  
I will be there don't be afraid  
I will be there don't be afraid  
I will be there  
  
When you are lost in the night  
No where to turn  
I will be there  
Don't be afraid  
Don't be afraid  
I will be there  
  
When everyone that you believe still lets you down  
I will be there  
Don't be afraid don't be afraid  
I will be there  
  
When you are lost in the night  
No where to turn  
I will be there  
Don't be afraid don't be afraid

If I gave my heart to you  
Would you promise to be true  
It would break my heart in two  
If you left me waiting anticipating  
  
Till some other magic day  
I may steal your heart away  
Then you would take my hand  
And then understand me  
When you'd really see me  
  
In a world of different dreams  
Where all things aren't what they seem  
When you would take my hand  
  
If I gave my heart  
If I gave my heart  
If I gave my heart to you  
  
For only truth remains  
Cause all things are just the same  
The excepting part of truth  
  
If I gave my heart  
If I gave my heart  
If I gave my heart to you  

Something about this is precious, something about this is sad  
Something about this is better, than I've ever had  
Hard and lean, you know what I mean?  
How do the roots become tangled? why does the spirit grow tired?  
Where is the key to your kingdom? yes that's my desire.  
Chorus:  
There are those who live to count the cost  
And then those who count themselves content  
I see heaven wrapped up in a box  
It is you come back to love again, in a dream, this living dream.  
Up in a heap I'm not bothered, down in the dumps I'm okay  
Here in my heart you're the best road, that I'll ever take, I'm serene yeh.  
Chorus:  
There are those who live to take the chance  
And then more who find themselves content  
I see heaven mapped out in advance  
It is you and that's my journeys end, in a dream, this living dream.  
I'm trying to hang on to the essence, I'm feeling more faint by the day  
It took such a long time to get it, I don't want to see it erased  
Chorus:  
There are those who live to count the cost  
And then more who count themselves content  
I see heaven wrapped up in a box  
It is you come back to love again, in a dream, this living dream  
This living dream.  

Cast my boat out to the ocean  
And set it sails to the wind  
Gentle breeze blowing into my heart  
I'm alive in this gentle world  
A life carefree  
A life carefree  
And in this love that you give me  
You have to share the joy and mystery  
The wonder of your smile  
And the power of your words  
That changes me  
That changes me  
Sometimes I could fly  
When your heart it touches mine  
Deep into the blue  
Where my soul is lost  
And all because of you  
Gave my heart to another love  
Crashing waves of pain came over me  
In my distress you came and rescued me  
Still the storm talked away  
Of life carefree  
Of life carefree  
Sometimes I could fly  
When your heart it touches mine  
Deep into the blue  
Where my soul is lost  
And all because of you  
When I found myself far away from you  
That's when I hear your voice  
Reminding me, calling me, lifting me  
Out into the blue  
Out into the blue  
Sometimes I could fly  
When you heart it touches mine  
Deep into the blue  
Where my soul is lost  
And all because of you  

Tumbling curls of green by stained glass streaming light  
And a yellow colored lampshade used to keep us up all night  
And the smile upon your face, a tear upon your cheek  
And the night sky on the window your heart calling out to me  
Come running home again Katie, come running home again  
Cross my heart and hope to die, shall I cause another tear from your eye?  
The mirror that won't talk and your nightgown on the door  
The old pedal singer just won't sing no more  
You can roll the reel for hours from the movie from this book  
Its a question mark upon this heart of mine sends an elder back to look  
Come running home again Katie, come running home again  
Cross my heart and hope to die, shall I 'cause another tear from your eye?  
Now I'm looking through a tunnel back into this room  
with the genius of the Druid when the sunlight floods the tomb  
And I'm never going back there, I wouldn't any way  
'Cause though I made the great escape, I never got away  
Come running home again Katie, come running home again  
Cross my heart and hope to die, shall I 'cause another tear from your eye?

It's a cold, old world that we're walking through  
They ought to tell you at the start  
But it's warm as toast walking two by two  
Lay down the burden of your heart  
  
[Chorus]  
Lay down the burden of your heart  
I know you'll never miss it  
Just show me, angel, where it hurts  
And let your mammy kiss it  
  
It's a fine, fine line between love and hate  
It's hard to tell the two apart  
But what strength I have, I offer you  
Lay down the burden of your heart  
  
[Chorus: x2]

First when I came to the town  
They called me young and bonny  
Now they've changed my name  
Called me the leaboy's honey.  
  
I'll dye my petticoats red  
And I'll face them with a yellow  
I'll tell the dyester lads  
That the leaboys I've to follow.  
  
It's over hills and dales  
And over dykes and ditches  
Say will I like the lad  
Who wears the moleskin breeches  
  
The black horse draws the cart  
And he's as proud as any  
Say will I like the lad  
That drives them on so canny  
  
Feather beds are fine  
And painted rooms are bonny  
But I would leave them all  
To jog away with johnny  
  
Oh, for saturday night  
It's I that'll see my dearie  
He'll come whistlin' in  
When I am tired and weary.  
  
First when I came to the town  
They called me proud and saucy  
Now they've changed my name  
Called me the leaboy's lassie.

I went to church on Sunday  
My love, she passed me by  
I knew her mind was changing  
By the roving of her eye  
By the roving of her eye  
By the roving of her eye  
I knew her mind was changing  
By the roving of her eye  
  
My love's fair and proper  
Her waist is neat and small  
She is quite good-looking  
And that' s the best of all  
And that' s the best of all  
And that' s the best of all  
And she is quite good-looking  
And that' s the best of all  
  
Oh, Hannah, loving Hannah  
Come give to me your hand  
You said that if you're married  
That i will be the one  
That i will be the one  
That i will be the one  
You said that if you're married  
That i will be the one  
  
I will go down by the river  
When everyone's asleep  
I'll think of loving Hannah  
And then sit down and grieve  
And then sit down and grieve  
And then sit down and grieve  
I'll think of loving Hannah  
And then sit down and grieve  
  
I went to church on Sunday  
My love she passed me by  
I knew her mind was changing  
By the roving of her eye  
By the roving of her eye  
By the roving of her eye  
I knew her mind was changing  
By the roving of her eye

Chorus  
A message of love, right to your heart  
Comes from above, to make a new start  
To spark a new flame,  
That will ring the world round  
Playing destiny's game  
And creating her sound in a message  
Of love  
Tell all your friends, our time is here  
We're on our way, the message is clear  
We're an act of creation, now  
And forever  
We're a river of nations  
We're coming together in a message  
Of love  
Chorus  
Spirits of love, spirits of life  
Help us be strong, help us to do right  
Here is our chance, to heal the old scars  
Learn a new way to dance to the song of  
The stars  
With a message of love  
Chorus  
I hear the butterflies dreaming, in the  
Shimmering air  
I feel the power of life, a flowering  
Fire everywhere  
I sing the tree, and the dove the eagle,  
Fox and the hare  
The right to exist is our right, we  
All share  
It's a message of love  
Chorus  
When evening falls, focus your mind  
When spirits call let your body unwind  
And open your heart, and do it today  
And do what is right, and do not delay  
Because a message of love

Chorus  
He is my hero, my dashing darling  
He is my caesar, dashing darling.  
I've had no rest from forebodings  
Since he went far away my darling.  
Every day I am constantly sad  
Weeping bitterly and shedding tears  
Because our lively lad has left us  
And no news from him is heard alas.  
The cuckoo sings not pleasantly at noon  
And the sound of hounds is not heard in nut-filled woods,  
Nor summer morning in misty glen  
Since he went away from me, my lively boy.  
Noble, proud young horseman  
Warrior unsaddened, of most pleasant countenace  
A swift-moving hand, quick in a fight,  
Slaying the enemy and smiting the strong.  
Let a strain be played on musical harps  
And let many quarts be filled  
With high spirit without fault or mist  
For life and health to toast my lion.  
Dashing darling for a while under sorrow  
And all ireland under black cloaks  
Rest or pleasure I did not get  
Since he went far away my dashing darling.  
For a while I was a gentle maiden  
And now a spent worn-out widow  
My spouse ploughing the waves strongly  
Over the hills and far away.  

These are the moments that we love so well  
Precious moments caught within a spell  
All too soon our lives thay fade away  
These are the moments that we wish would stay  
  
If I had my life to live again  
I would choose to be with you my friend  
Time moves slowly and it goes so fast  
And who knows how long the days will last  
  
So cherish deep within you  
The love you get today  
Let the moment linger  
Cause tomorrow steals that away  
Yes tomorrow steals that away  
  
These are the memories that we made so well  
Lives like stories that we long to tell  
When we're old with not too much to say  
We'll have the memories that we made today  
We'll have the memories that we made today

Moon river, wider than a mile  
I'm crossing you in style some day  
Oh, dream maker, you heart breaker  
Wherever you're goin', I'm goin' your way  
Two drifters, off to see the world  
There's such a lot of world to see  
We're after the same rainbow's end, waitin' 'round the bend  
My huckleberry friend, Moon River, and me  
Oh, dream maker, you heart breaker  
Wherever you're goin', I'm goin' your way  
Two drifters, off to see the world  
There's such a lot of world to see  
We're after that same rainbow's end, waitin' 'round the bend  
My huckleberry friend, Moon River, and me

Oh my Donald he works on the sea  
On the waves that blow wild and free  
He splices the ropes and he sets the sails  
While southward he rolls to the home of the whale  
And he ne'er thinks o' me far behind  
Nor the torments that rage in my mind  
He's mine for only part of the year  
And I'm left all alone with only my tears  
Ye ladies that smell of wild rose  
Think ye for your perfume to where a man goes  
Think ye o' the wives and the babies that yearn  
For a man ne'er returning from hunting the sperm  
My Donald he works on the sea  
On the waves that blow wild and free  
He splices the ropes and sets the sails  
While southward he rolls to the home of the whale  
  
  
  

If life is a river and your heart is a boat  
And just like a water baby, baby born to float  
And if life is a wild wind that blows way on high  
And your heart is Amelia dying to fly  
  
Heaven knows no frontiers  
And I've seen heaven in your eyes  
And if life is a bar room in which we must wait  
'Round the man with his fingers on the ivory gates  
  
Where we sing until dawn of our fears and our fates  
And we stack all the deadmen in self addressed crates  
In your eyes faint as the singing of a lark  
That somehow this black night  
  
Feels warmer for the spark  
Warmer for the spark  
To hold us 'til the day  
When fear will lose its grip  
  
And heaven has its way  
Heaven knows no frontiers  
And I've seen heaven in your eyes  
If your life is a rough bed of brambles and nails  
  
And your spirit's a slave to man's whips and man's jails  
Where you thirst and you hunger for justice and right  
Then your heart is a pure flame of man's constant night  
In your eyes faint as the singing of a lark  
  
That somehow this black night  
Feels warmer for the spark  
Warmer for the spark  
To hold us 'til the day when fear will lose its grip  
  
And heaven has its way  
And heaven has its way  
When all will harmonise  
And know it's in our hearts  
  
The dream will realise  
Heaven knows no frontiers  
And I've seen heaven in your eyes  
Heaven knows no frontiers  
And I've seen heaven in your eyes

Seemed like I'd gone off the side of a mountain  
Couldn't be sure I was even alive  
Fallen from the icy heights  
Landed with a broken cry  
In this valley of shadows and sorrow and sighs  
Can you save me baby  
  
[Chorus]  
Nobody lives without love  
Nobody gets to give up  
You can try to lock your heart away  
But love will come back for you some day  
Nobody lives without love  
  
Thought I could live out my life as a stranger  
Hide from the heartbreak that love always brings  
Make it to the higher ground  
Try to turn the volume down  
Couldn't stop the sirens from singing  
Sing for me baby  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You came along like a flash of pure lightning  
Crashed into my life like a runaway star  
Feel myself falling like gravity's angel  
Now I'm standing here offering a stranger my heart  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Seemed like I'd gone off the side of a mountain  
Couldn't be sure I was even alive  
Thought I could live my life as a stranger  
Hide from the heart break that love always brings  
Seemed like I'd gone off the side of a mountain  
Couldn't be sure I was even alive

I found your letter in my mailbox today  
You were just checking if I was okay  
And if I miss you, well you know what they say  
Just once in a very blue moon  
Just once in a very blue moon  
Just once in a very blue moon  
And I feel one coming on soon  
  
No need to ask me if we can be friends  
And help me right back on my feet again  
And if I miss you, well just now and then  
Just once in a very blue moon  
Just once in a very blue moon  
Just once in a very blue moon  
And I feel one coming on soon  
  
There's a blue moon shining  
When I am reminded of all we've been through  
Such a blue moon shining  
Does it ever shine down on you?  
  
You act as if it doesn't hurt you at all  
Like I'm the only one who's getting up from a fall  
Don't you remember now don't you recall  
Just once in a very blue moon  
Just once in a very blue moon  
Just once in a very blue moon  
And I feel one coming on soon  
Just once in a very blue moon  

I do not see the way out  
I do not really know how  
Like a shot in the dark  
Went your hallowed ground  
Had you taken too much  
Kept me well out of touch  
And refused to let me go  
  
I cannot see to you pain  
I do not hear you complain  
You are now but a dot in the pouring rain  
You created this mess now I'm bent to your stress  
And it seems to suit you well  
  
One and only two can be lonely  
I'm my own child blessed and unholy  
I your eyes the storm surely rising up  
Do do do do  
  
I do not see the way out  
You cannot turn this around  
Like a walk in the dark  
You have weighed me down  
I can't stand in your place  
Can't take this away  
It was all good to be true  
  
One and only two can be lonely  
I'm my own child blessed and unholy  
I your eyes a storm surely rising up  
Do do do do  
  
Oh you never talk about it  
No you never scream about it  
You took a spirit young and whole  
You turned this child into an old soul  
Old soul  
  
One and only two can be lonely  
I'm my own child blessed and unholy  
I your eyes a storm surely rising up  
Do do do do  
  
Oh you never talk about it  
No you never scream about it  
You covet things that you don't own  
You turn this child into and old soul  
Old sould  
  
One and only two can be lonely  
I'm my own child blessed and unholy  
I your eyes a storm surely rising up  
  
One and only two can be lonely  
I'm my own child blessed and unholy  
I your eyes a storm surely rising up

There you may stand in your splendor and jewels  
Swaying me in both directions  
One is the right one, the other for fools  
How do I make my selection?  
The city lies silent in the warm morning light  
The sand is as golden as saffron  
Oasis of love, sweet water of life  
God bless the poor ones who have none though they have tried  
  
Someone is drowning down there in the flood  
But this river will dry by tomorrow  
Is it ocean or stream, this love in my blood?  
Bringer of joy or of sorrow?  
The end of the journey must soon be in sight  
Birth is the start of the swansong  
Oasis of love, sweet water of life  
God bless the poor ones who want some, but are denied  
  
No one is given the map to their dreams  
All we can do is to trace it  
See where we go to, know where we've been  
Build up the courage to face it  
While we fumble in the darkness where once there was light  
Roaming the land of the ancients  
Oasis of love, sweet water of life  
God bless the poor ones whose patience never died  
  
While we stumble in blindness where once there was sight  
Searching for trees in the forest  
Oasis of love, sweet water of life  
God bless the poor ones who have none though they have tried  
  
God bless the poor ones who want some, but are denied  
God bless the poor ones whose patience never died  
God bless the poor ones on that one-way donkey ride

They sent you down a paper friend, I hear  
You went back on all the vows you once held dear  
There you stretched so calm and quiet  
And things looked good, now don't deny it  
You walked on air for fifteen minutes  
And after that there was nothing in it  
You don't need those paper friends at all  
No, you don't need those kind of friends  
  
You say you've lost your sense of time again  
Well, you've been using that excuse since who knows when  
You went the way of all young rebels  
Ignore the gods, embrace the devils  
But they're no good for you in your state  
So why not drive them right out of your gates?  
'Cause you don't need those paper friends at all  
You don't need those type of friends  
  
No one knows what you're feeling  
And life goes on in its own sweet time  
Your passions flame for no reason  
You haunt the city for something that shines  
Even one thing to rhyme  
  
And if I meet you on the rounds today  
I hope you won't turn on your heel or walk away  
Yes, I know it takes so much effort  
But facing up can be so much better  
So what if dreams, they all come to nothing?  
Just blow your nose and keep on looking  
'Cause you don't need those paper friends at all  
You don't need those kind of friends  
  
You don't need those paper friends at all  
You don't need those paper friends

Last night I dreamed you were back again  
Larger than life again, holding me tight again  
Placing those same kisses on my brow  
Sweeter than ever now, lord I remember how  
Couldn't get enough of kissing  
Do you know how much I'm missing?  
No you don't, but I do  
Days like a slow train trickle by  
Even the words that I write refuse to fly  
All that I can hear is your song haunting me  
Can't get the melody out of my head you see  
Distractions I've been using  
Do you know how much I'm losing?  
No you don't, but I do  
But I do and I wonder if I'm past the point of rescue  
An is no word from you at all the best that you can do  
Never meant to push or shove you  
Do you know how much I love you?  
No you don't, but I do.  

I was angry with my friend  
I told him so and my wrath did end  
I was angry with my foe  
Told him not and my wrath did grow  
  
And I watered it in fears  
Night and morning with my tears  
And I sunned it with smiles  
And with soft deceitful wiles  
  
And it grew both day and night  
Till it bore an apple bright  
And my foe beheld it shine  
And he knew that it was mine  
  
Was a poison tree  
Beware of a Poison Tree  
Poison Tree  
Growing inside of me  
  
And into my garden stole  
When the night had veiled the pole  
In the morning glad I see  
My foe outstretched  
Beneath that tree  
  
Was a Poison Tree  
Beware of a Poison Tree  
Poison Tree  
Growing inside of me  
  
Poison Tree  
Beware of a Poison Tree  
Poison Tree  
  
What happened to you  
And me

I remember when we were sweethearts  
I was safe with you, you were my protector  
Those days are over, now I need someone  
Someone to keep me safe from you  
  
Love was all we had, we were young and sure  
Who'd expect their love would turn to war?  
I don't know who to pity more  
How much pain can love endure?  
  
I should leave you but I can't seem to  
You say, "I'm sorry, dear," and I believe you  
Though the next time may be the worst yet  
How easily I forgive, how quickly you forget  
  
The poison words, the ugliness  
When low on hope and deep in debt  
The promises that bring regret  
For loving you, is this all I get?  
  
The poison words, the ugliness  
The cold remains of married bliss  
To all our dreams, a fatal kiss  
Oh what kind of love is this?

Last year at Lady Mary's fair when I was in Dundee  
I fell in with an old sweetheart and he being on a spree  
His company I did accept and with him I did go  
But to my sad misfortune it proved my poor 'through  
We wandered east we wandered west we wandered through the lawn  
He said he'd see me home that night but home I never saw  
He kept beside me all the while resolved to have his will  
And by and by we lost our way, at the back of Rare's Hill  
  
For when we got to Rare's Hill, the laddie said to me  
We can't go home tonight my dear, it's far to late you'll see  
But the night is warm and in my bush, I've got another drill  
And we can lie down here, content, at the back of Rare's Hill  
  
For then he poured a nipper piece to quiet all alarm  
When I awoke in the morning we were locked in each other's arms  
He handed me the bottle, another glass to fill  
And I drank his heath, in store o'wealth, at the back of Rare's Hill  
  
And then the lad he said to me, "Oh lassie do not mourn"  
"For while I draw the breath of life from you I'll never harm"  
"If you will come to yonder town, my wedded wife you'll be"  
"we'll be the happiest couple t'was ever in Dundee"  
  
So it's may I never prosper, and may I never thrive  
In anything I take in hand as long as I'm alive  
If e'er I say I rue the day, my laddie had his will  
Success to Lady Mary's fair, and the back of Rare's Hill.

I'm the latest apparition  
Cutting slices in the night  
I come through without permission  
Moving in and out of human sight  
I'm the tapping on your shoulder  
I am the raving in the storm  
I'll take shelter in you rafters  
I'm the shiver when you're warm  
I'm the gold in california  
I am the well in mexico  
Like the vultures in the valley  
I will wait for you to go  
I'm the gypsy in you pocket  
I am the horseman in your dreams  
I'm the reason dogs are barking  
I am the hand that stops the scream  
I am the baby's cry that isn't  
I am the distant relative  
I'm the scratching in the ceiling  
I am advice you shouldn't give  
I'm the ghost of a travelling salesman  
My foot will be there in your door  
Though I can walk through walls and windows  
I will knock just like before  
I am the darkness in your daughter  
I am the spot beneath the skin  
I am the scarlet on the pavement  
I am the broken heart within  
I won't take a train to nowhere  
I will not touch just anyone  
Ask a stranger why I'm waiting  
In the chamber of a gun  

Ring them bells, ye heathen  
From the city that dreams  
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries  
Cross the valleys and streams  
For they're deep and they're wide  
And the world's on it's side  
And time is running backwards  
And so is the bride  
Ring the bells st.peter  
Where the four winds blow  
Ring them bells with an iron hand  
For the people will know  
Oh it's rush hour now  
On the wheel and the plow  
And the sun is going down  
Upon the sacred cow  
Ring them bells sweet martha  
For the poor man's son  
Ring them bells so the world will know  
That God is one  
Oh the shephered is asleep  
Where the willows weep  
And the mountains they are filled  
With lost sheep  
Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf  
Ring them bells for all of us who are left  
Ring them bells for the chosen few  
Who will judge the many when the day is through  
Ring them bells, for the time that flies  
For the child that cries  
When the innocence dies  
Ring them bells st.catherine  
From the top of the room  
Ring the bells from the fortress  
For the lillies that bloom  
For the lines they are long  
And the fighting is strong  
And they're breaking down the distance  
Between right and wrong  

When I lay down to take my rest  
Most of the time my minds on happiness, yes  
Some of the time but not for long  
I get a feeling of something that's yet to come  
I get a picture telling me what's undone  
  
[Chorus]  
When I find out that you don't love me honey  
When I find out that your going away  
There'll be no surprise  
Because I saw you running  
Saw you running from where I lay  
There'll be no surprise  
Because I saw you running  
Saw you running from where I lay  
  
Well I've got an eye upon the road  
And I've got a hand to hold my heavy load oh yes  
I've got a man and I've got a gun  
One is for fighting oh the other one is just for fun  
One is for fighting oh the other one is just for fun  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When I lay down to take my rest  
Most of the time my minds on happiness, yes  
Some of the time but not for long  
I get a feeling of something that's yet to come  
I get a picture telling me what's undone  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]

Schooldays over, come on then john  
Time to be getting your pit boots on  
On with your sack and your moleskin trousers  
Time you were on your way  
Time you were learning the pitman's job  
And earning a pitman's pay.  
Come on then jim, it's time to go  
Time you were working down below  
Time to be handling a pick and shovel  
You start at the pits today  
Time to be learning the collier's job  
And earning a collier's pay.  
Come on then dai, it's nearly light  
Time you were off to the anthracite  
The morning mist is on the valley  
It's time you were on your way  
Time you were learning the miner's job  
And earning a miner's pay  
Repeat first verse  

I once had a sweetheart, I loved her right well  
I loved her far better than my tongue can tell  
Her parents did slight me for the want of guile  
Adieu to all pleasure since I lost my dear  
  
She went away from me and moved through the fair  
Where hand-clapping dealers' loud shouts rent the air  
The sunlight around her did sparkle and play  
Saying, "It will not be long, love, 'til our wedding day"  
  
When dew falls on meadows and moths fill the night  
When glow from the greesach on half-froze, half-light  
I'll slip from my casement and I'll run away  
Then it will not be long, love, 'til our wedding day  
  
I dreamed last night that my love came in  
She came in so easy, her feet made no din  
She came stepping up to me and this she did say  
"It will not be long, love, 'til our wedding day"

I can see it in your eyes  
What I know in my heart is true  
That our love it has faded like the summer run through  
So we walk doen the shore line one last time together  
Feel the wind blow our wandering hearts like a feather  
But who knows who's waiting in the wings of time  
Dry your eyes  
We're gonna go where we can shine  
  
Don't be hiding in sorrow or clinging to the past  
With your beauty so precious and the seasons so fast  
No matter how cold the horizon appears or how far the first night when I held
you near  
You've gotta rise from these ashes like a bird of flame  
Take my hand  
We're gonna go where we can shine  
  
For all that we struggle for all we pretend  
It don't come down to nothing except love in the end  
And ours is a road that is strewn with goodbyes  
But as it unfolds as it all unwinds  
Remember your soul is the one thing you just can't compromise  
Step out of the shadows  
  
You gotta go where we can shine  
Oh we're gonna go where we can shine  
Shine

Walking all the day near tall towers where falcons build their nests  
Silver winged they fly, they know the call of freedom in their breasts  
Soar Black Head against the sky  
Between the rocks that run down to the sea  
Living on your western shore, saw summer sunsets, asked for more  
I stood by your Atlantic sea and sang a song for Ireland  
Talking all the day with true friends, who try to make you stay  
Telling jokes and news, singing songs to pass the night away  
Watched the Galway salmon run like silver dancing darting in the sun  
Living on your western shore saw summer sunsets, asked for more  
I stood by your Atlantic sea and sang a song for Ireland  
Drinking all the day in old pubs where fiddlers love to play  
Someone touched the bow, he played a reel, it seemed so fine and gay  
Stood on Dingle beach and cast, in wild foam we found Atlantic Bass  
Living on your western shore, saw summer sunsets asked for more  
I stood by your Atlantic sea and sang a song for Ireland  
Dreaming in the night, I saw a land where no man had to fight  
Waking in your dawn, I saw you crying in the morning light  
Lying where the Falcons fly, they twist and turn all in your rare blue sky  
Living on your western shore, saw summer sunsets asked for more  
I stood by your Atlantic sea and I sang a song for Ireland

I cannot stop this child from touching me  
I see not fault in watching her bloom  
She knows where fire begins and where sparks might fly  
Yet I feel she may be consumed.  
She done turns on the be stage  
She shook hands when the shoe fit  
I wanna know how the land lies  
I'll let you in on a secret.  
I did not steal away when love rode by  
I did not let myself be unkind  
It's so heard to say where love meets lust  
I often think I'm losing my mind.  
I trade notes with the press league  
They send back their suggestions  
I wanna know where I come from  
But all I get are directions.  
Chorus  
I can't get started, can't get pain  
What's wrong?  
Big ideas, the find intentions  
They're all gone  
It takes two flagons of courage  
Pounds, shillings and pence  
You wind up going nowhere  
It doesn't make sense.  
I see my brother's face grow dark with care  
I spend my time avoiding his gaze  
I pray that God might make his dreams come true  
I'd give so much to feel he's been saved.  
A bright spark in the playground  
Dead loss as an anchor  
You don't call him a misfit  
He's just stuck for an answer.  
Chorus (2)  

He don't know how to lie  
Or undermine you  
He don't know how to steal  
How to deal or deceive  
So leave him alone, set him free  
Cause he's speaking with the angel  
That only he can see  
  
You say he's so helpless  
Well what about you  
You don't pull the strings  
Don't you know anything  
Just leave him alone, let him be  
Cause he's speaking with the angel  
That only he can see  
  
Would you teach him about heaven  
Would you show him how to love the earth  
Would you poison him with prejudice  
From the moment of his birth  
  
He in the name of love  
He in the blood of the lamb  
He that never lays blame  
He don't even know his name  
Just leave him alone, let him be  
Cause he's speaking with the angel  
Speaking with the angel  
The very one that spoke to you and me  
Oh do you remember?

Night owns my white bones  
But what's left is still saying  
Strange prayers in high places  
Wild airs with wilder graces  
Birds fly with no motion  
What draws me, draws the ocean  
  
[Chorus]  
Down on my knees again, still believing  
In the time of reason no more  
Down on my knees again, still believing  
Peace of mind is worth any chore  
  
Great dreams and laid schemes  
Just blown down by high winds  
And strong signs from old forces  
Wild dogs run trackless courses  
Night changes sweet mountains  
Vain hopes need cold fountains  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Night owns my white bones  
But what's left is still saying  
  
[Chorus]

When the morning comes  
I gaze on you with desire  
When the morning comes  
My look will be perfectly plain  
When the morning comes  
My beloved one  
When the morning comes  
You'll know that we both feel the same  
  
In the afternoon  
Misgivings will pale into nothing  
In the afternoon  
We'll know what it is to believe  
When it's afternoon  
And I covet you  
In the afternoon  
I'll give you no reason to leave  
  
[Chorus]  
Done with time and patience I moved with the crowd  
Lonely in my silence and being without  
Then all in one instant straight out of the blue  
Out of all its goodness the summer sent you  
  
Now it's evening time  
And I reach for you lying beside me  
Now it's evening time  
Your kiss will be tender and sure  
Now it's evening time  
Just like every time  
In the evening time  
I love you as much as before  
  
[Chorus]  
  
All in one sweet instant straight out of the blue  
Out of all its goodness the summer sent you  
  
The summer sent you  
The summer sent you

A shimmer or a shudder, a sentence or a shriek  
What other languages do we speak?  
I don't know what the answer is, but fair dues to you  
A local lack of wisdom never stopped your being true  
A drummer in the basement  
A rhythm - roll at each hand's turn  
Finding one thing you can believe in  
Could seem like so much work  
You've heard the cry before  
Up and away we shall go  
Tearing up the town  
Tearing up the town  
Hurry to dinner, son, the heat is on  
Your daddy's in the oven and your mamma, she's gone  
She went down to the clinic, but the news was not good  
They told her it was nothing much, but she'd had quite enough  
The ruins of a household, a loverboy who sits and stares  
"No, No" she cried, "I can't take it, I'm gonna go out somewhere"  
You've heard the cry before  
Up and away she goes  
She's tearing up the town  
Tearing up the town  
Tearing up the town  
Now we're really with it, comrades, now we're set  
Ben Dolan's right behind us with the castanets  
It took a lot of pleading, but he came here after all  
And Ben's the very boy to take us right to where we want  
Hey, look at them couples linking through the rainy streets  
Someplace to be in love, the best there'll ever be  
Oh sister sadness, get yourself behind me  
Oh brother badness, why must you deny me?  
It doesn't matter where I've gone  
I'm on the run like everyone  
Tearing up the town  
Tearing up the town  
We're tearing up the town

The sky collapsed around us, you didn't seem to care  
I hailed you through the raindrops, you weren't even there.  
I juggle with the breakfast, you fret behind the sheets  
I want you to be steadfast, you want to be released.  
Chorus:  
Oh my pretty darling, where did we go astray  
Oh my pretty darling, I thought you'd come to stay.  
We're all dollied up for the circus, oh isn't it grand  
We're laughing, jumping and kissing, we're beating the band.  
I've got no more smiles to win you, no tricks to turn your head  
When love cannot continue, there's not much to be said.  
Chorus  
It's all cut and thrust at the circus, and maybe makes three  
You're twisting my words into serpents, I'm down on my knees.  
Oh my pretty darling, I thought you'd come to stay  
I thought you'd come to stay, I thought you'd come to stay.  

The sheep's in the meadow  
The cow's in the corn  
Now is the time for a child to be born  
You'll laugh at the moon and you'll cry for the sun  
And if it's a boy he'll carry a gun  
Sang the crow on the cradle  
And if it should be that this baby's a girl  
Never you mind if her hair doesn't curl  
With rings on her fingers dna bells on her toes  
A shadow above her wherever she goes  
Sang the crow on the cradle  
The crow on the cradle  
The black on the white  
Somebody's baby is born for a fight  
The crow on the cradle  
The white on the black  
Somebody's baby is not coming back  
Sang the crow on the cradle  
Bring me my gun and I'll shoot  
That bird dead  
That's what your mother and  
Father once said  
A crow on the cradle what can we do  
This is the thing I must leave up to you  
Sang the crow on the cradle  

This old house is falling down around my ears  
I'm drowning in a river of my tears  
When all my will is gone, you hold me sway  
I need you at the dimming of the day  
  
You pull me like the moon pulls on the tide  
You know just where I keep my better side  
  
What days have come to keep us far apart?  
A broken promise or a broken heart  
Now all the bonnie birds have wheeled away  
I need you at the dimming of the day  
  
Come the night, you're only what I want  
Come the night, you could be my confident  
  
I see you on the street in company  
Why don't you come and ease your mind with me?  
I'm living for the night we steal away  
I need you at the dimming of the day  
Oh I need you at the dimming of the day

Farewell my lovely Johnny, a thousand times adieu  
You are going away from the holy ground and the ones that love you true  
You will sail the salt seas over and then return for sure  
To see again the ones you love and the holy ground once more  
  
You're on the salt sea sailing, and I am safe behind  
Fond letters I will write to you, the secrets of my mind  
And the secrets of my mind, my love, you're the one that I adore  
Still I live in hopes you'll see the holy ground once more  
  
I see the storm a-rising, and it's coming quick and soon  
And the night's so dark and cloudy you can scarcely see the moon  
And the secrets of my mind, my love, you're the one that I adore  
And still I live in hopes you'll see the holy ground once more  
  
But now the storms are over, and you are safe and well  
We will go into a public house and we'll sit and drink our fill  
We will drink strong ale and porter and we'll make the rafters roar  
And when our money, it is all spent, you'll go to sea once more  
  
You're the one that I adore  
And still I live in hopes that you'll see the holy ground once more

It reads like a fairytale, and that's what it was  
Young man in his prime, young girl from the cross  
The most perfect of strangers, and then the night closed in  
And the holy ground took care of everything  
  
Now she was a fine one, and he was a handsome man  
One look was enough, and away they ran  
They spent many happy hours and then the night closed in  
And the holy ground took care of everything  
  
Oh what's the use in complaining?  
In for a penny, in for a pound  
I remember the loving time  
And nothing else really counts  
  
And I recall the promise they made  
With a faith I can but admire  
That she'd be the one he adored  
And he'd be her heart's desire  
  
It didn't come true in the end, they went their separate ways  
He couldn't change what he was, she wasn't ready to wait  
They couldn't live in the daylight, they let the night close in  
And the holy ground took care of everything  
  
They couldn't live in the daylight, they let the night close in  
And the holy ground took care of everything  
They couldn't live in the daylight, they let the night close in  
And the holy ground took care of everything  
  
I remember the loving time  
And nothing else really counts

When I was young I spoke like a child, And I saw with a childs eyes  
And an open door was to a girl, Like the stars are to the skies  
It's funny how the world lives up to all your expectations  
With adventures for the stout of heart, And the lure of the open spaces.  
  
There's two lanes running down this road, And whichever side you are on  
Accounts for where you want to go, And what you are running from  
Back when darkness overtook me, On a blindman's curve.  
  
Chorus:  
  
I relied upon the moon, I relied upon the moon  
I relied upon the moon and St. Christopher.  
  
Now I've paid my dues 'cause I have owed them, But I've paid a price sometimes  
For being such a stubborn woman, In such stubborn times  
I have run from the arms of lovers, I have run from the eyes of friends  
I have run from the hands of kindness, I have run just because I can.  
  
Now I've grown and I speak like a woman, And I see with a woman's eyes  
And an open door is to me now, Like the saddest of goodbyes  
Well it's too late for turning back, And I pray for the heart and nerve  
.  
Chorus: (repeat chorus)  
  
I relied upon the moon, I relied upon the moon  
I relied upon the moon and St. Christopher to be my guide.

It's taste was sweet like summer wine,  
the heart that beats in double time.  
So he waltzed right in, he bowled you over,  
and you're still reeling from the feeling when he's gone.  
The door is closed, the lock is turned,  
and all the memories and letters have been burned.  
  
So when you pick the handsome flower  
don't forget the thorn upon the rose  
It's cut is deep and it's scar lasts forever,  
it follows love wherever love goes.  
  
Just how we fall it's hard to know  
when what we feel we seldom show.  
So we show the parts we feel are best,  
we squirm around the edges trying to cover up the rest.  
You think you know him and he thinks the same,  
when underneath it all it's just a crazy guessing game  
  
So when you pick the handsome flower  
don't forget the thorn upon the rose!  
It's cut is deep and it's scar lasts forever  
it follows love wherever love goes.  
  
Win or lose it's just the same  
tears of joy tears of pain  
They're hand in hand, they come as one  
you'll never see the moon without the promise of the sun  
For all the bruises for all the blows  
I'd rather feel the thorn than to never see the rose  
  
So when you pick the handsome flower  
don't forget the thorn upon the rose  
It's cut is deep and it's scar lasts forever  
it follows love wherever love goes.  
  
It follows love wherever love goes.

Well, I woke up today and found frost perched on the town  
It hovered in a frozen sky and gobbled summer down  
And when the sun turned straight and cold  
And shivering trees are standing in a naked row  
I get the urge for going, but I never seem to go  
  
I had someone in the summertime with summer-colored skin  
And not another one in town my darling's heart could win  
And when the leaves fell tumbling down  
And bully winds did rub their faces in the snow  
He got the urge for going, and I had to let him go  
  
Well, he got the urge for going  
When the meadow grasses are turning brown  
Summertime is a-falling down  
Winter's closing in  
  
And the warriors of winter gave a cold, triumphant shout  
All that stays is dying, and all that lives is getting out  
You see the geese in chevron flight  
A-flapping and a-racing on before the snow  
They've got the urge for going and they've got the wings to go  
  
They've got the urge for going  
When the meadow grasses are turning brown  
Summertime is a-falling down  
Winter's closing in  
  
I'll pile the fire with kindling and pull the blankets to my chin  
I'll lock the vagrant winter out and bolt my wandering in  
I'd like to call back summertime  
And let her stay for just another month or so  
But she's got the urge for going, and I'll have to let her go  
  
She's got the urge for going  
When the meadow grasses are turning brown  
Summertime is a-falling down  
Winter's closing in  
  
Well, she's got the urge for going  
When the meadow grasses are turning brown  
All her empires are falling down  
Winter is closing in

There is a time in life it seems  
For believing in dreams, for me it's gone  
And though I realize today  
Dreams are empty anyway, I still feel wronged.  
Chorus  
I felt cheated when you went away  
But not as defeated as I felt the day  
You came back and we found so little to say.  
There is a time in life I know  
When we all must outgrow young ideals  
And the wisdom that we gain  
Is paid for with the pain I now feel.  
Chorus  
There is a time in life it seems  
For believing in dreams for me it's gone.  

Like a jazz refrain the midnight train is callin'  
Hey, you'd best go soon the late night moon is fallin'  
Let the nightbirds whisper to themselves  
This train pulls out at twelve  
High tides breakin' on the shores, church bell tolls  
Chorus:  
There's a train that leaves tonight  
I might just ride on  
Nothin' here that makes me wanna stay  
There's a train that leaves tonight  
I might just ride away  
I just can't hope to tell you 'bout the stillness and the quiet  
'bout the frozen fields so lonely and the train songs in the night  
About the sounds of nothin' moving, night fields all aglow  
I simply got to leave you my heart cries out to go  
Chorus  

Oh love is never easy  
It's almost always out of your way  
It's not the path of least resistance  
It's not some words you get to say  
  
It's a stream running up a mountain  
It's a wave rolling out from the shore  
Wish I could say I never felt that way before  
  
I have a friend who's lonely  
She is chasing after her dreams  
And she is the one and only  
One who knows how hard it could be  
  
There's a treasure on her island buried in the city of news  
Wish I could say we didn't have that much to lose  
  
One friend tried to end it  
He could not see the good in his life  
In his mirror or his pocket  
And his hopes had come down like a knife  
  
It's a stream running up a mountain  
It's a wave rolling out from the shore  
Wish I could say I never felt that way before  
  
There's a treasure on these islands buried in the city of news  
Wish I could say we didn't have that much to lose  
Oh there's a treasure on these islands buried in the city of news  
Wish I could say we didn't have that much to lose

When I see you coming  
In your trespass shoes  
Hear the song you're humming  
How can i refuse  
With your half drunk bottle  
And your slurring tongue  
Singing sentimental  
Don't it always make me feel so young  
  
Been alone  
We've been together  
Stood at toe to toe  
Getting older doesn't matter when lights down low  
When the push comes down to shoving  
When the four winds blow  
Ain't nobody ever loved me like you do  
  
Now my heels are snagging  
On these pavement stones  
Days and nights are dragging  
'Til I get you home  
With your four o'clock shadow  
and your cowboy songs  
Singing sentimental  
Don't it always make me feel so strong  
  
Been alone  
We've been together  
Stood at toe to toe  
Getting older doesn't matter when lights down low  
Push comes to shove and worse for better  
when the four winds blow  
Ain't nobody ever loved me like you do  
  
With your forehead furrowed  
And your facts all wrong  
Oh so temperamental  
Oh but baby when it's said and done  
  
Been alone  
We've been together  
Stood at toe to toe  
Getting older doesn't matter when lights down low  
Push comes to shove and worse for better  
Only goes to show when the four winds blow  
  
Been alone  
We've been together  
Stood at toe to toe  
Getting older doesn't matter when lights down low  
Push comes to shove and worse for better  
Only goes to show  
  
Ain't nobody ever loved me like you do  
Ain't nobody ever loved me like you do  
Ain't nobody ever loved me like you do

We don't always live in harmony  
And often there are times when we are enemies  
I fight with you, and you fight with me  
Trying to get the balance right.  
Sometimes we cause each other pain  
Sometimes our wills are not the same  
And often we tire of the strain  
Trying to get the balance right.  
Chorus  
Like a circus pair  
Hight up in the air  
Working on their act  
We need that kind of pact  
High above the ring  
Watch them balancing  
See how they unite  
We too can get it right.  
We don't always seem to get along  
And one of us often acts too strong  
Sometimes we find we're goin' wrong  
Trying to get the balance right.  
Chorus  
We don't always live in harmony  
And often there are times when we are enemies  
But I love you and you love me  
When we get the balance right  
When we get the balance right  
We can get the balance right.  

In darkness we do what we can  
In daylight we're oblivion  
Our hearts so raw and clear  
Are turning away, turning away from here  
  
On water we have walked like the fearless child  
What was fastened we've unlocked revealing wondrous wild  
And in search for confirmation  
We have jumped into the fire  
And scrambled with our burning feet through uncontrolled desire  
  
Chorus  
  
There's a well upon the hill from our ancient past  
Where an age is standing still holding strong and fast  
And there's those that try to tame it  
And the carve it into stone  
Ah but words cannot extinguish it  
However hard they're thrown  
  
Chorus  
  
On Racherie they have worked with their island dreams  
By Lough Cleggan they have nourished in the mountain streams  
And in searching for acceptance  
They have given it away  
Only the children of our children  
Know the price they had to pay  
  
Chorus

Big bad man's law doesn't carry much sway  
When you come around here  
You can still scratch my back  
And I can still change sides  
Don't carry no torch 'til you have it in type  
That I'm doing okay  
It's only one man's outlook  
It could be one more lie  
Look at it closely  
Counterfeit mostly  
Yesterdays's brushwork  
Using yesterdays' paint  
And everything that I believe  
And every note that you receive  
They're just vanities to you  
Hear that liverpool wind as I'm making my way  
For the very last time  
Is this a resurrection?  
And do you really care?  
I can't relish no kiss 'til I happen to hear  
Your honeycomb nouns  
Let you down so often  
I'll do the same again  
Look at it closely  
Counterfeit mostly  
Yesterday's stories  
It's the same all over the world  
And everything that I believe  
And every note that you receive  
They're just vanities to you  
Busy little bodies have a story to tell  
Even if it goes against the grain  
Tiny little seeds have got an ocean to swell  
But who am I to rock the boat  
And everything that I believe  
And every note that you receive  
Look at it closely  
Counterfeit mostly  
Yesterday's brushwork  
Using yesterday's pain  
Look at it closely  
Counterfeit mostly  
Yesterday's stories  
It's the same all over the world  

I know it's the same old song I'm singing  
But this time these words are just for you  
That's the only thing that's new  
I know that I've sung about a million  
Borrowed lines and phrases from a few  
This one's till as good as new  
Without the fanfare I love you  
By day I move words around like flowers  
I deliver by the afternoon  
"cause the piper calls the tune  
Today I made full use of the hours  
I explored the smallest avenue  
And that feeling still came through  
Without the fanfare I love you  
Sure I've lost my way sometimes  
But I've had to pay  
Sometimes I've gone completely overboard  
Moved a million phrases round, tried to make them leave the ground  
Still the only line that's soared  
Bidding all the rest adieu  
Sounding still as good as new  
Without the fanfare I love you  
Hello, do I still have your attention?  
I forgot to mention thanks again from the captain and the crew  
And so without the sweet perfume or roses  
I hope you can still believe it's true  
Stripped of all that much ado  
Without the fanfare I love you  
Without the fanfare I love you
