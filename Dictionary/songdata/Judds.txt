I've tried so hard  
You know I can't do more  
It's the turn of the card  
It's the close of the door  
  
The lies you told  
You know they hurt so deep  
So I'll go home  
And cry myself to sleep  
  
And day after day  
You've been treating me bad  
Friends come up and say,  
Why do you take all that?  
  
'Cause it's making me moan  
And it's making me weep  
So I'll go home  
And cry myself to sleep  
  
You play at love  
Like a child plays games  
One day I'm in  
Then I'm out again  
  
You change the rules  
And I just can't win  
You've broken me now  
So I give in, yeah, yeah  
I've been through worse  
  
But I don't know what  
Oh, I gave to you  
Everything that I got  
So take this heart  
Or what's left to keep  
  
And I'll go home  
And cry myself to sleep  
So I'll go home and cry myself to sleep  
Cry myself to sleep

Do I dare show him lovin'?  
Do I go for double or nothin'?  
Do I act like I don't care?  
Or, do I dare?  
  
Do I do what my heart's sayin'?  
Do I hide my love awaitin'?  
Make believe that he's not there?  
Or, do I dare?  
  
This girl's got a problem  
She don't know what to do  
If there's some way of tellin'  
When a man is true  
  
Will he love me faithfully?  
Will he leave me blue?  
Should I run?  
Or, could this be the one?  
  
Do I dare jump in the middle?  
Sure, I care more than a little  
If he don't fall, I'll loose it all  
Tell me, do I dare?  
  
Do I dare?  
Do I dare?  
  
Do I tell him that I've held him  
In my dreams so tight?  
Well, could I risk one little kiss?  
Or, should I take a chance tonight?  
  
Do I do what my heart's sayin'?  
Do I hide my love awaitin'?  
Make believe that he's not there?  
Or, do I dare?  
  
Lord, do I dare?  
Lord, do I dare?

Don't be cruel  
To a heart that's true  
Don't be cruel  
To a heart that's true  
I don't want no other love  
Baby it's just you I'm thinking of  
Well you know I can be found  
  
Sitting home all alone  
If you can't come around  
Well at least please telephone  
  
Don't be cruel  
To a heart that's true  
Baby if I made you mad  
For something I might have said  
Please let's forget the past  
'Cause the future looks bright ahead  
  
Don't be cruel  
To a heart that's true  
I don't want no other love  
Baby it's just you I'm thinking of  
Well now don't stop thinking of me  
  
Don't make me feel this way  
Come on over here and love me  
You know I want to say  
  
Don't be cruel  
To a heart that's true  
Why should we be apart  
I really really love you baby  
  
Cross my heart  
Well lets walk up to the preacher  
And let us say I do  
And then you'll know you have me  
And I'll know I'll have you too  
  
Don't be cruel  
To a heart that's true  
I don't want no other love  
Baby it's just you I'm thinking of

Well, brother, better get right with God  
Don't you hear Jerusalem moan?  
While here upon this Earth, do try  
Don't you hear Jerusalem moan?  
  
(Chorus)  
Don't you hear Jerusalem moan?  
Don't you hear Jerusalem moan?  
Glad souls are singin'  
And the joy be ringin'  
Don't you hear Jerusalem moan?  
  
Well, get to church and listen to the preacher  
Don't you hear Jerusalem moan?  
Get right with God and He'll be your teacher  
Don't you hear Jerusalem moan?  
  
(Chorus)  
Well, you better get on your knees and pray  
Don't you hear Jerusalem moan?  
Let Jesus wash your sins away  
Don't you hear Jerusalem moan?  
(Chorus)  
  
(Repeat First Verse)  
(Chorus)  
Don't you hear Jerusalem moan?

There's a bird in my tree  
Singin' sad autumn melodies  
There's a old sumer breeze  
And it's blowin' away  
  
There's a cloud in my sky  
There's a boy who's been on my mind  
There's a tear in my eye  
And I think it might rain  
  
[Chorus]  
Drops of water, drops of water  
Fallin' down around fate  
Oh, it's nothin' but the rain in my life  
Drops of water, drops of water  
Fallin' down around my fate  
Oh, it's nothin' but the rain in my life  
  
There's a moon up above  
Shinin' down on the one I love  
There's a pain in my heart  
He's gone away  
  
If a star falls tonight  
Let it fall and with all my might  
I close my eyes, make a wish  
That he'll come back someday  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, it's nothin' but the rain in my life  
Drops of water, drops of water  
  
Oh, it's nothin' but the rain in my life  
Drops of water, drops of water

The night was dark, rain fallin' down.  
Look for my baby, he's nowhere around.  
I traced his footsteps down to the shore,  
Afraid he's gone forever more.  
  
[Chorus]  
I looked at the sea, and it seemed to say,  
"I took your baby from you, away."  
I heard a voice, cryin' in the deep,  
"Come join your baby in my endless sleep."  
  
Why did we quarrel? Why did we fight?  
Why did I leave him alone tonight?  
That's why his footsteps ran to the sea.  
That's why my baby is gone from me.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ran in the water, heart full of fear.  
There, in the breakers, I saw him near.  
Reached for my baby, held him to me,  
Stole him away from the endless sleep.  
  
I looked at the sea and it seemed to say,  
"You took your baby from me, away."  
My heart cried out, "He's mine to keep!"  
I saved my baby from that endless sleep.  
I saved my baby from that endless sleep.  
I saved my baby from that endless sleep.

I know where I'm goin'  
Don't you want to come too?  
I got my reservations  
And I got one for you  
The train's leavin' just after dark  
There's always room for a lovin' heart  
I know where I'm goin'  
Don't you want to come too?  
  
I know my destination  
It's a' waitng for me  
I got no hesitation  
That's where I want to be  
And by the time that the sun comes up  
I'll be drinkin' from a lovin' cup  
I know where I'm goin'  
Don't you want to come too?  
  
[Chorus]  
I know why I'm singin'  
Don't you want to sing too?  
Can't you hear the bells a ringin'?  
Let the spirit move you  
  
Just close your eyes and let it flow  
Lean your head back, let it go  
I know where I'm goin'  
Don't you want to come too?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I know where I'm goin'  
Don't you want to come too?  
I got my reservations  
And I got you for you  
I know why I'm singin'  
Don't you want to sing too?  
Can't you hear the bells a ringin'?  
Let the spirit move you  
Spirit move you, yeah  
  
I know where I'm goin'  
Don't you want to come too?  
I know where I'm goin'  
Don't you want to come too?

I laid a red rose  
On your front porch  
Wrote "I love you"  
On a note  
I rang the door bell  
And turned to go  
Baby, when the curtains moved  
I couldn't believe the view  
  
[Chorus:]  
I saw the light in your window tonight  
I saw two shadows holding each other tight  
I know the truth when I look in your eyes  
I saw the light in your window tonight  
  
So take your cheatin' hands  
Off my red dress  
'Cause I ain't wearin'  
This thing for you  
I see you clearly now  
And your lies, too  
They say that love is blind  
Baby, not this time  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Why, baby, why should I listen to you?  
I cried, baby, cried, now I'm walking out the door  
  
They say that love is blind, baby, not this time  
  
[Chorus]

If I were you  
I'd think it over  
Take your time  
Before you leave  
Everyone wants the perfect lover  
  
If I were you  
I'd fall in love with me  
If I were you  
I'd just remember  
Don't miss the forest for the trees  
  
The mighty flame  
Was once an ember  
If I were you I'd fall in love with me  
  
If I were you  
I'd whisper sweet I love you's everyday  
If I were you, I'd never ever let me get away  
  
If I were you  
I'd look me over  
There's much more than what you see  
I can prove You'll need no other  
If I were you I'd fall in love with me

Dance with me darlin' 'til dawn  
I want to sway in your arms  
'Til the stars fade away  
Fade away  
Moving together as one  
'Til the first gentle rays of the sun  
Light up the day  
Light the day  
  
[Chorus]  
And while the music still plays  
Please let me hear you keep saying  
Over and over I'm falling  
Falling in love with you  
  
Say there's no way I could lose you  
Hold me tight  
I'm falling in love tonight  
Touch me and tell me it's true  
That I'm not asleep and that you  
Are not just a dream  
Just a dream  
  
Here with your heart pressed to mine  
We flow like the river that winds  
It's way to the sea  
To the sea  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Say there's no way I could lose you  
Hold me tight  
I'm falling in love tonight  
Hold me tight  
I'm falling in love tonight

In my dreams  
You belong to me  
She doesn't mean a thing  
She never wore your ring  
In my dreams  
My greatest wish comes true  
My arms are holding you  
In my dreams  
  
[Chorus]  
I hear your laughter  
And I taste your lips  
I feel you tremble  
At my fingertips  
Each night you're mine  
But each morning finds you gone  
  
In my dreams  
My soul is wide awake  
Craving the love we make  
In my dreams  
  
[Chorus]  
  
In my dreams  
I'll hide this love I steal  
'Til you feel what my heart feels  
In my dreams  
In my dreams  
In my dreams  
In my dreams

I want to tell 'bout my lover  
And I want to tell you 'bout my best friend  
Compared to all the others  
He's a little bit different  
A friend saw him on the town  
Said he was turnin' all the pretty girls down  
She said, "You really should be proud of him."  
  
[Chorus]  
Isn't he a strange one?  
He thinks comin' on to me is a whole lot of fun  
He doesn't want anybody else but me  
Isn't he a strange one?  
He thinks I hung the moon  
He's pretty sure I was the one  
And I'm glad he'll never be  
  
A stranger to me  
I know he's one in a million  
When he says I'm the one that he's dreamin' of  
I hope he doesn't wake up anytime soon  
From this honeymoon  
My girlfriends are turnin' green with envy  
They want to know are there anymore at home like him  
Cupid must be really watchin' over me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah, I' m glad he'll never be  
A stranger to me  
Isn't he a strange one?  
Isn't he a strange one?

Dear Mama, well here's a letter from your girl  
Well I think my city days are done gone  
And it ain't been three weeks since I came  
And Mama, do remember what you said  
Say your prayers before you go to bed child  
And remember city boys ain't the same  
  
On like a John Deere Tractor  
In a half acre field  
Tryin' to plow a furrow  
Where the soil is mighty still  
How I wish I was home mom  
Where the blue grass is growin'  
  
And the sweet country boys don't complain  
And mama, so much perfume  
I thought I drank  
And the lord didn't seem to be nowhere around  
Hey, I felt just like a flower from the vine  
  
On like a John Deere Tractor  
In a half acre field  
Tryin' to plow a furrow  
Where the soil is mighty still  
How I'd like to be home mom  
Where the blue grass is growin'  
  
And the light shimmers and it shines  
On like a John Deere Tractor  
In a half acre field  
Tryin' to plow a furrow  
Where the soil is mighty still

Well ever since the day that time began  
There's been this thing 'tween a woman and a man  
We'll, I don't know but I do believe  
It started in the garden with Adam and Eve  
Sampson and Delilah had their fling  
'Til she cut his hair and clipped his wing  
It don't matter how the story's told  
Love stays young it can't grow old  
  
[Chorus]  
Let me tell you about love  
About the moon and stars above  
It's what we've all been dreamin' of  
Let me tell you about love  
  
Well, Bonaparte and Josephine  
I believe they had a pretty good scene  
Until she said Bonnie boy, we're through  
That's when he met his Waterloo  
Julie baby and Romeo  
Fell in love and stole the show  
I know they are history  
But there ain't been nothin' like you and me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now Sheba she was a beauty queen  
The purtiest thing that you ever have seen  
Solomon he was a mighty wise  
Sheba she done caught his eye  
The world would be in a dreadful fix  
If it wasn't for the love between the cats and chicks  
The world wouldn't amount to much  
Without a hug and a kiss and a tender touch  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Let me tell you about love  
Let me tell you about love  
Yeah

I'd gladly walk across the desert  
With no shoes upon my feet  
To share with you the last bite  
Of bread i had to eat  
I would swim out to save you  
In your sea of broken dreams  
When all your hopes are sinkin'  
Let me show you what love means  
  
[Chorus]  
Love can build a bridge  
Between your heart and mine  
Love can build a bridge  
Don't you think it's time?  
Don't you think it's time?  
  
I would whisper love so loudly, every heart could understand  
That love and only love can join the trials of man  
I would give my heart's desire so that you might see  
The first step is to realize that it all begins with you and me.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When we stand together, it's our finest hour  
We can do anything, anything  
We're believing in the power  
  
[Chorus: x2]

Love ain't a candle  
It doesn't burn for one night  
And need the dark to shine  
Love is alive  
  
And love ain't just a word  
In every dictionary  
With no where defined  
Love is a man and he's mine  
  
[Chorus]  
Love is alive  
And at our breakfast table  
Everyday of the week  
Love is alive  
And it grows everyday and night  
Even in our sleep  
Love is alive  
And it's made a happy woman out of me  
Oh, love is alive  
And here by me  
  
Love ain't just a moon  
A distant far away dream  
That needs the night to rise  
Love is alive  
And love ain't just a song  
Sweet words of music  
To go dancin' by  
Love is a man and he's mine  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Love is alive, here by me

Mama,I found someone  
Like you said would come along  
He's a sight, so unlike  
Any man I've known  
I was afraid to let him in  
'Cause I'm not the trustin' kind  
But now I'm convinced  
That he's heaven sent  
And must be out of his mind  
  
[Chorus]  
Mama, he's crazy  
Crazy over me  
And in my life is where he says  
He always wants to be  
I've never been so in love  
He beats all I've ever seen  
Mama, he's crazy  
He's crazy over me  
  
And Mama, you've always said,  
"Better look before you leap!"  
Maybe so, but here I go  
Lettin' my heart lead me  
He thinks I hung the moon and the stars  
I think he's a livin' dream  
Well, there are men  
But ones like him  
Are few and far between  
  
[Chorus]

If you hear her cry at night  
Better turn on your light  
Maybe your baby's got the blues  
When she says there's nothing wrong  
She just wants to be alone  
You can bet your baby's got the blues  
  
[Chorus]  
Women like men to make the first move  
And touch her like he used to  
When there's achin' in her heart  
Only tenderness can find  
Women like men to make them feel alive  
And keep her apron strings untied  
Yes women like men  
To love them through the blues sometime  
  
When her days all run the same  
And she says she thinks she needs a change  
Maybe your baby's got the blues  
If she says she's just a wife  
And so far from the glamorous life  
You can bet your baby's got the blues  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yes, women like men to love them through the blues sometimes

Met my first love down in Texas  
In a club in San Anton'  
Both of us were lonely  
Had no one to call our own  
So we danced and laughed 'til closin' time  
And had no place to go  
So with the top pulled down, drove all night  
Run off to Mexico  
But my blond haired blue eyed cowboy  
Turned out to be bad news  
Disappeared one morning  
Left his old boots and the blues  
Now there's been so many others  
But none of them were true  
The only one I could count on  
To keep me company is you  
  
[Chorus]  
Mr. Pain, oh, it's you again  
Never really wanted us to be such friends  
You always seem to show up  
When I'm all alone  
That's when you move right in  
And make yourself at home  
Mr. Pain, Oh, Mr. Pain  
  
We'll you'd think by now that I'd have learned  
To see through your disguise  
A heartache really shouldn't be  
So hard to recognize  
But you wear so many face  
Every line is new  
And somehow I just always end up  
Wakin' up with you  
  
Mr. Pain oh, it's you again  
Never really wanted us to be such friends  
Never fail to find when I'm all alone  
That's when you move right in  
And make yourself at home, oh Mr Pain

I woke up this morning and the sun refused to shine  
I looked everywhere to try to find that man of mine  
I just found an ice cold pillow layin' by my side  
Well, the moon is down but it still ain't dawn  
The world is dark and my baby's gone  
  
I looked out the window and I could not help but cry  
He left me all alone and never said goodbye  
He even took that golden sunlight from the sky  
Well, the moon is down but it still ain't dawn  
The world is dark and my baby's gone  
  
Sit here and wonder why he left me  
I just try to think what I've done wrong  
Stay in the darkness of this lonely room  
Well, the moon is down but it still ain't dawn  
The world is dark and my baby's gone  
  
Woke up this morning and the sun refused to shine  
I looked everywhere to try to find that man of mine  
I just found an ice cold pillow layin' by my side  
  
Well the moon is down but it still ain't dawn  
The world is dark and my baby's gone  
Well the moon is down but it still ain't dawn  
The world is dark and my baby's gone  
  
Ain't no moonlight  
Ain't no starlight  
Ain't no sunlight  
My baby's gone

The keeper of the gates of wisdom  
Please let me in  
Cause I just can't go through  
Another heartache again  
Pretty lies and alibis  
How could I be so blind?  
Now I'm all alone and scared to stay  
Slowly going out of my mind  
  
He was my strongest weakness  
I surrendered heart and soul  
Its gonna be a long, long time  
'Til I regain control  
I'm still a prisoner  
Held captive by his memory  
He was my strongest weakness  
And I'm afraid hell always be  
  
I gave my faithful heart to someone  
I couldn't understand  
How he held my little world  
In the palm of his hand  
Now he's gone and life goes on  
So if this pain will ever end  
Will I be afraid to risk it all  
Ever fall in love again?  
  
He was my strongest weakness  
I surrendered heart and soul  
Its gonna be a long, long time  
Til I regain control  
I'm still a prisoner  
Held captive by his memory  
He was my strongest weakness  
And I'm afraid hell always be

There are guys who will lie  
Then they'll hang you out to dry  
But not my baby  
Promise you everything  
Then they never buy the ring  
But not my baby  
Say they're out with their pals  
When they're seein' other gals  
But not my baby  
  
And they think it's a crime  
When they have to spend a dime  
But not my baby  
Bring you gifts now and then  
Always from the five and ten  
But not my baby  
And I've heard stories of  
Guys afraid to fall in love  
But not my baby  
  
I don't have to dream  
My dream baby  
He's the sweetest dream  
That's already come true  
And every time we touch, just touch  
I can feel how very much  
How much he loves me  
Not my baby  
No, not my baby  
  
There are guys that I've seen  
Who are wrong or being mean  
But not my baby  
Getting mad, getting cross  
If you don't let them be boss  
But not my baby  
  
Yes, I've sure got a lot  
And the best thing that I've got  
I've got my baby  
And I know he will stay  
He will never go away  
No, not my baby  
No, not my baby  
No, not my baby  
No, not my baby

Here's a little girl playin' dress up  
Somewhere under all that lace  
Standin' in her mama's high heeled shoes  
With a lipstick covered face  
And here's a little boy on a pony  
He's a cowboy all the way  
He used to pull my hair and make me mad  
At the Saturday matinee  
Who would've thought that I'd lose my heart  
To the same little boy someday  
  
Lookin' through my old pictures  
Faded photographs  
Some of them bring me close to tears  
Others make me laugh  
Old memories seem to come alive  
And open up the past again  
And let me dream inside  
  
Here's brother with his first automobile  
Thought he'd washed the paint away  
He took a job that took him West  
He's doing very well  
We don't see much of brother these days  
And this is my favorite of my papa  
He's dressed up in his Sunday suit  
A wide brimmed hat, a watch on a chain  
Well, I'm gonna tell you the truth  
It's a picture of a downright handsome man  
Caught in the prime of his youth  
  
Lookin' through my old pictures  
Faded photographs  
Some of them bring me close to tears  
Others make me laugh  
Old memories seem to come alive  
And open up the past again  
And let me dream inside  
  
They open up the past again and let me dream inside

There's one hundred and one  
Little reasons why  
I should leave you here say goodbye  
But I just can't seem to say we're through  
  
And the reasons why  
Are one hundred and two  
One hundred and one  
Little tears fall  
And every drop  
  
Makes me feel so small  
But hard as I try  
I can't leave you  
  
And the reasons why baby  
Are one hundred and two  
I'm countin' up  
  
The times I've cried  
The times you'd leave  
The times you lied  
And everyday  
  
I'm keeping score  
When it all adds up  
I need you more  
One hundred and one  
Lonely nights  
  
You leave me here  
Now honey, that ain't right  
But, still I forgive  
Everything you do  
  
And the reasons why  
Are one hundred and two  
Yeah, the reasons why baby  
Are one hundred and two  
There's one hundred and one  
  
Little reasons why  
But, one hundred and two  
Keeps me by your side

I'm holding back a flood of tears  
Just thinking 'bout those happy years  
Like all the good times that are no more  
My love is gone, gone, gone forever more  
  
Silence so deep only my soul can hear  
Says now the past is what I fear  
The future isn't what it used to be  
Only today is all that's promised me  
Flow on, river of time  
Wash away the pain and heal my mind  
Flow on, river of time  
  
Carry me away  
And leave it all far behind  
Flow on river of time  
We're all driven by the winds of change  
Seems like nothing ever stays the same  
It's fate that guides me around the bend  
Life's forever beginning, beginning again  
  
Flow on, river of time  
Wash away the pain and heal my mind  
Flow on, river of time  
Carry me away  
  
And leave it all far behind  
Flow on river of time  
Carry me away and heal my mind  
Flow on, river of time  
Carry me away and heal my mind  
Flow on, river of time  
Flow on  
Carry me away and heal my mind  
Flow on river of time  
Flow on  
Flow on river of time

River roll on  
Wish I could be like you  
No looking back  
And no heart that breaks in two  
  
You'll never now  
What a goodbye can do  
Oh, I wish I were you  
River roll on  
River roll on  
  
Free as the winds that blow  
Feelin' no pain  
We just roll 'em with the flow  
No tears to cry  
  
No songs to make you blue  
Oh, I wish I were you  
River roll on  
  
Oh, I never thought that  
I could ever feel so all alone  
But I'm learnin'  
  
The world keeps on a turnin'  
Even though he's gone  
River roll on  
  
Keep rollin' endlessly  
Down to the arms  
Of the ever waiting sea  
  
I wish that I had someone waitin' too  
Oh, I wish I were you  
River roll on  
I wish that I had someone waitin' too  
Oh, I wish I were you  
River roll on  
Oh, I wish I were you  
River roll on  
River roll on  
River roll on  
River roll on

When you hit rock bottom  
You've got two ways to go  
Straight up  
And sideways  
I have seen my share of hard times  
And I letting you know  
Straight up  
Is my way  
  
Things are tough all over  
But I've got good news  
When you get down to nothing  
You've got nothing to lose  
I was born naked  
But I glory bound  
And a dead end street  
Is just a place to turn around  
  
(Chorus)  
When the sky is the limit  
Up on easy street  
Rock bottom  
Ain't no place to be  
Rock bottom  
Ain't no place for me  
  
When the law of the jungle  
Is the law of the land  
Good luck  
Stayin alive  
I keep a clinched fist under  
This hat in my hand  
Cause only the strong survive  
  
Things are tough all over  
But I've got good news  
When you get down to nothin

Sittin in the porch swing  
Listenin' to the light rain  
Beatin' on the tin roof  
Baby, just a-me and you  
Rockin' with the rhythm of the rain  
  
Slide on over  
Baby hold me closer  
Movin' to and fro  
Just swayin' like a slow freight train  
Rockin' with the rhythm of the rain  
  
So let the breeze keep blowin'  
(Rockin' with the rhythm of the rain that's fallin')  
(Night birds are singin' the crickets are callin')  
Oh, my heart will never be the same.  
Keep the sweet feelin' flowin'  
(Whisper in my ear baby)  
(Ooh, feels so fine)  
(Nights like this come once in a lifetime)  
Me and my baby rockin' with the rhythm of the rain  
  
Oh baby hold me tight  
Say-hey-hey you love me  
That's all I want to hear tonight  
  
Sittin' in the porch swing  
Listenin' to the light rain  
Beatin' on the tin roof  
Baby, just me and you  
Rockin' with the rhythm of the rain  
  
Slide on over  
Baby hold me closer  
Movin' to and fro  
Just swayin' like a slow freight train  
Rockin' with the rhythm of the rain  
  
So let the breeze keep blowin'  
(Rockin' with the rhythm of the rain that's fallin')  
(Night birds are singin' the crickets are callin')  
Oh, my heart will never be the same.  
Keep the sweet feelin' flowin'  
(Whisper in my ear baby)  
(Ooh, feels so fine)  
(Nights like this come once in a lifetime)  
Me and my baby rockin' with the rhythm of the rain  
  
Me and my baby rockin' with the rhythm of the, rain  
Ow

His letter came this morning  
C.O.D.  
Says he's found somebody  
Who reminds him of me  
He says he needs some space  
  
That might be the case  
Wasn't even man enough  
To tell me to my face  
I got the rompin', stompin'  
Bad news blues  
  
He stole my money  
He stole my time  
When he stole my heart  
Honey, he really crossed that line  
  
A major felony  
Send out an A.P.B.  
Go tell that thief of hearts  
To bring it on back to me  
  
I got the rompin', stompin'  
Bad news blues  
  
Well, come tonight  
I'm steppin' out  
Gonna sing and dance  
Gonna shake and shout  
  
Forget about ol' what's his name  
You know two can play this game  
Whatever it takes to lose  
These rompin', stompin'  
Bad news blues  
  
Well, men are full of trouble  
Girl, that ain't nothin' new  
We ain't found nothin' better  
And until the day we do  
  
Sister friend, be wise  
Just realize  
Stay away from the ones  
Who'll do you wrong and tell you lies  
  
They'll give you the rompin', stompin'  
Bad news blues  
  
That's right  
They'll give you the rompin', stompin'  
Bad news blues

Oh you better watch out you better not cry  
You better not pout I'm tellin' you why  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
He's a makin' a list checkin' in twice  
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

He sees you when you're sleeping he knows when you're awake  
He knows if you've been bad or good so be good for goodness sake  
  
Oh you better watch out you better not cry  
You better not pout I'm tellin' you why  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
  
With little tin horns and a little toy drums  
A root a toot toot and a rum a tum tums  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
And curly head dolls that cuddle and coo  
Elephants boats and kiddie cars too  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
  
The kids and girls in boyland will have a jubilee  
They're gonna build a toyland all around the Christmas tree  
  
[ guitar ]  
So you better watch out you better not cry  
You better not pout I'm tellin' you why  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
Yeah Santa Claus is comin' to town Santa Claus is comin' to town  
Santa Claus is comin' Santa Claus is comin'  
Santa Claus is comin' Santa Claus is comin'

Billy was a small town loner  
Who never did dream  
Of ever leaving southern Arizona  
Or ever hearing wedding bells ring  
He never had a lot of luck with the ladies  
But he sure had a lot of good working skills  
Never cared about climbing any ladder  
He knew the way in a small cafe, found the will  
  
He met Miss Bonnie  
And a little bit of her was a little too much  
A few movies and a few months latter  
The feeling got strong enough  
They didn't own a car  
So it must have been love  
That drove him uptown for a diamond  
That's when he started goin?  
  
Over the line  
Working overtime  
To give her things just to hear her say she don't deserve them  
But he loves her and he just kept going overboard  
Over the limit to afford to give her things he knew she wanted  
'Cause without her where would he be?  
See, it's not for him  
She is his only need  
  
Ring on her finger and one on the ladder  
A new promotion every now and then  
Bonnie worked until she couldn't tie her apron  
Then stayed at home and had the first of two children  
And my, how the time did fly  
The babies grew up and moved away  
Left 'em sitting on the front porch rocking  
And Billy watching Bonnie's hair turn gray  
  
And every once in a while you could see him get up  
And he's head downtown  
'Cause he heard about something she wanted  
And it just had to be found  
Didn't matter how simple or how much  
It was love  
And, boy, ain't that love just something  
When it's strong enough to keep a man goin?  
  
Over the line  
Working overtime  
To give her things just to hear her say she don't deserve them  
But he loves her and he just kept going overboard  
Over the limit to afford to give her things he knew she wanted  
'Cause without her where would he be?  
See, it's not for him  
She is his only need  
  
Over the line  
Working overtime  
She is his only need  
His only need  
Overboard  
Over the limit  
Just for her  
She

When I awoke  
There you stood beside me  
I wonder now were you there all the time  
Like a rose beneath the snow I've been waiting  
And it took your kiss to make me come alive  
  
[Chorus]  
Sleeping heart, love is all around you  
Empty arms, what are you waiting for  
Rub your eyes your handsome prince has found you  
Sleeping heart, Sleep no more  
  
You don't have to tell me where you come from  
I loved you in my dreams a long long time  
In my slumber I kept seeing someone  
And I recognized you when your lips touched mine  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Rub your eyes your handsome prince has found you  
Sleeping heart, sleep no more

Through these sleepless nights  
I cry for you  
And wonder who  
Is kissing you  
  
Oh, these sleepless nights  
Will break my heart in two  
Somehow through the days  
  
I don't give in  
I hide the tears  
That wait within  
Oh, but, then through sleepless nights  
  
I cry again  
Why did you go?  
Why did you go?  
Don't you know?  
Don't you know  
I need you?  
  
I keep hoping you'll  
Come back to me  
Oh, let it be  
Please let it be  
Oh, my love, please end  
These sleepless nights for me  
My love, please end these sleepless nights for me

One day a mother  
Come to a prison  
To see an 'erring  
But precious son  
She told the warden  
How much she loved him  
It did not matter  
What he had done  
  
[Chorus]  
She did not bring to him  
(Bring to him)  
Parole or pardon  
(Pardon free)  
She brought no silver  
(Brought no gold)  
No pomp nor style  
(Him to see)  
It was a halo  
(Halo bright)  
Sent down from heaven  
(Heaven's light)  
The sweetest gift  
(A mother's smile)  
  
Her boy had wandered  
Far from the far side  
Though she had pleaded  
With him each night  
But not a word did  
She ever utter  
That told her heartaches  
Her smile was bright  
  
[Chorus]  
  
She left a smile  
You can remember  
She's gone to heaven  
From heartache's free  
Them bars around you  
Will never change her  
He was her baby  
An error will be  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It was a halo bright  
Sent down from heaven's light  
The sweetest gift  
A mother's smile

Everybody read about it  
You can find it in the checkout line  
They say I got husbands a-leavin', boyfriends a-callin'  
And problems that ain't even mine  
Well, all that trash don't bother me none  
It's all just part of the game  
I'm just a good-hearted down-home country girl  
And you all know my name  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I like to ride  
I need my space  
And I love being at home  
But if you wanna' get right into my heart  
Take a left at the wyld unknown  
The wyld unknown  
  
You don't wanna' cross my little mama  
And you sure don't wanna mess with me  
'Cause there's a wild streak running down from the roots  
To the top of my family tree  
I'm a woman of passion, a woman of faith  
As honest as I can be  
To tell you the truth, I'm bulletproof  
So take your best shot at me  
  
(Repeat Chorus)  
  
[Bridge:]  
  
The wyld unknown  
I'll show you somethin' that  
You ain't never been shown  
  
Whenever trouble finds me  
I always take my share of the blame  
I'm the kind of girl who can rock your world  
Or love you like a hurricane  
I'm a woman of passion, a woman of faith  
As honest as I can be  
To tell you the truth, I'm bulletproof  
So take your best shot at me  
  
(Repeat Chorus)

It doesn't matter if you're rich or poor  
If you're old or young  
Everybody, every now and then  
Has got to have some fun  
  
So turn up the music  
Turn up the juice  
Put me in the spotlight  
And turn me loose  
  
You better hold on tight  
This country's gonna rock tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
This country's rockin'  
To the beat of a brand new drum  
Back in Kentucky where I come from  
They love to hear that old guitar strum  
This country's rockin'  
Jump back and let the bad boys play  
Everywhere across the USA  
This country's rockin' all the way  
  
You might ride a horse, drive a Porsche  
Or cruise in limousines  
Eat caviar with champagne  
Or cornbread with your pinto beans  
  
But there's one thing  
In which we all agree  
We love our country music  
Like the Queen loves tea  
  
What a lovely sight  
We're gonna rock tonight  
  
[Chorus]

Some call it country with a little bit of rhythm and blues  
And when the boys start rockin'  
There's a beat that you just can't lose  
Where it's gonna take us nobody knows  
It sure feels good to the body and soul  
  
[Chorus]  
I love the slide of a steal guitar  
I love the moan of an old blues harp  
I love the shake of a tambourine  
I love the bass when it's low and mean  
So put on your shoutin' shoes  
And turn it loose  
Turn it loose  
  
You feel like dancin'  
And you just can't stay in your seat  
Your knees start knockin'  
And you can't help stompin' your feet  
Before you even know it you'll be singin' a long  
Makes me want to stay hear all night long  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Turn it loose  
Everybody put on your shoutin' shoes and turn it loose  
Grab your shoutin' shoes and turn it loose

High and dry in the long hot day  
Lost and lonely in every way  
Got the flats all around me, sky up above  
Yes, I need a little water of love  
I've been too long lonely and my heart feels pain  
Cryin' out for some soothing rain  
I believe I've taken enough  
Yes, I need a little water of love  
  
[Chorus]  
Water of love, deep in the ground  
But there ain't no water here to be found  
Someday, baby, when the river runs free  
It'll carry that water of love to me  
  
Once I had a man I could call my own  
Once I had a man, now my man is gone  
Once there was a river, now there's a stone  
You know it's evil when you're living alone  
  
[Chorus]

Who is this baby  
Where did he come from  
He's the son of a carpenter  
The chosen one  
He's the hope of the angels  
A gift of his love  
Just a child in a manger  
Gods only son  
Hallelujah, hallelujah  
Hallelujah, hallelujah  
Shepards were watching  
Out under the sky  
When the star over Bethlehem  
Lit up the night  
He's the light in the darkness  
A gift from above  
He is held with the spirit  
Of Gods holy love  
Hallelujah, hallelujah  
Hallelujah, hallelujah  
Angels sing  
Worship our king  
  
  

When I say I want you  
When I say I need you  
Why don't you believe me?  
When I say I miss you  
When I'm not there with you  
Why don't you believe me?  
True love is so hard to find  
Why are you running away from mine?  
  
When I say just call me  
Anytime you want me  
Why don't you believe me?  
When I say I'll be there  
Now until forever  
Why don't you believe me?  
True love is so hard to find  
Why are you running away from mine?  
  
So, darlin', don't be afraid  
I'll never leave you alone  
I don't care how long it takes  
I'm willing to wait  
'Til you make my heart your home  
  
When you say I want you  
When I say I need you  
Why don't you believe me?  
Believe me  
Why don't you believe me?  
Believe me  
Why don't you believe me?

She was sitting crossed legged on a hood of a ford  
Filing down her nails with a emory board  
Talking to her friends about people they knew  
And all of the things that young girls do  
When she said you see that guy in the baseball cap  
I'd like to spend some time with a boy like that  
Betty said I seen him at the hardware store  
I think his name is Billy, but I'm not sure  
And as they talked a little while he passed by  
She smiled at him he just said "hi"  
He was thinking to him self as he walked away  
Man I'd like to find a girl like her someday  
  
(Chorus)  
Young love, strong love, true love  
It's a new love  
Their gonna make it through the hard times  
Walk those lines  
Young love  
We'll she just couldn't stop her self from thinking about him  
And at a store downtown she saw him again  
She had both hands full  
He held open the door  
Said my name is Billy  
I've seen you before  
Can I help you with these  
Can I give you a ride  
Can I take you out on a Saturday night  
She didn't have to say what she was feeling inside  
He could see the answer shining in her eyes  
  
(Chorus)  
We'll from that day on  
You couldn't keep them apart  
They were side by side, heart to heart  
Momma cried as Billy slipped the ring on her hand  
And when the baby was born she was crying again  
Well he worked real hard and put some money down  
On a little old house at the edge of town  
And that night as he held her he couldn't believe  
That god had made a girl that he'd never ever leave  
  
(Chorus)  
She was sitting crossed legged on the hood of a ford  
Filing down her nails with an emory board
