I do not sleep tonight  
I might not ever  
The sins of the past have come  
See how they sit down together  
  
Outside my window  
Outside my door  
And I know the reason  
What they've all come here for  
  
You my love, my sweet, sweet love  
Are what it's all, because of  
  
Surrender is easy  
I know you do me no harm  
But your innocence haunts me  
The most fatal of charms  
  
Oh I must have done some wrong  
On a dark and distant day  
For I know full and well tonight  
This is how that I must pay  
  
And you my love, my sweet, sweet love  
Are what it's all, because of  
You my love, my sweet, sweet love  
Are what it's all because of

Ten Thousand princes  
I've seen them all  
I've seen them come  
And I see them fall  
I've watched them win  
I've watched them loose  
Since you've been around  
No-one gets to choose  
Because when the game begins  
And the time is now  
When there is no more talking  
Only here and now  
There is only here and now  
I ain't seen anything quite like you  
Ain't been anyone quite like you  
  
Ten thousand princes  
All backs against the wall  
Then Thousand losers  
When the winner comes to call  
How they scream in frustration  
Then thousand reasons why  
The rhetoric is endless  
I see the laughter in your eyes  
Because when the game begins  
And the time is now  
When there is no more talking  
Only here and now  
Only here and now  
I ain't seen anything quite like you  
Ain't been anyone quite like you

Love started out like fresh April dawn  
Dreams I have left faded and torn  
  
I was born to lose baby  
I was born to lose baby  
  
There was this woman when I was a boy  
She was my queen and I was her toy  
  
I was born to lose baby  
I was born to lose baby  
  
Now I could not give what the rich man could give no  
Only myself for as long as I live  
  
I was born to lose baby  
Oh I was born to lose baby  
  
Born to lose  
Born to lose  
Born to lose

Born and raised in wilderness  
Of suburban shops and schools  
How she tried and tried to be satisfied  
With a job on the typing pool  
She hated the smell of carbon paper  
The office so smoky and dry  
How she longed for the day she would make her get away  
And say her last goodbye  
  
Bows and bangles on her fingers  
And silver bells on her toes  
That lady has music where she wonders  
That lady has music where she goes  
  
Married a guy with prospects  
And so became his wife  
And that my friend is the end of the story  
'Cause that was the rest of his life  
She could have been a movie star  
She could have made the scene  
Right or wrong she still hangs on  
Each night to her favourite dream  
  
Bows and bangles on her fingers  
And silver bells on her toes  
That lady has music where she wonders  
That lady has music where she goes

No standing with these burning feet  
I got to kill the the fire  
Got to kill the heat  
I see a road and a river  
I gotta go  
'cause there's fire in my shoes  
And you're moving too slow  
For these burning feet  
  
I got to move  
Burning feet  
Need a cool groove  
Burning feet  
Win or lose  
Looking to kill the heat  
Oh these burning shoes  
  
One day they'll find me in pieces,  
By the side of the track  
Smoke trail behind me,  
Flames from my back  
This is what made me,  
Yeah how I was made  
Forever, in the heat  
And never in the shade  
Of these burning feet  
  
Burning feet  
I got to move  
Burning feet  
Need a cool groove  
Burning feet  
Win or lose  
Looking to kill the heat  
Oh these burning shoes

Catfish girl, makes it feel so fine  
Catfish girl, always pulling on my line  
When I see her smiling face, She get me every single time  
Yeah she does.  
Catfish girl, I miss you Lord I feel so blue  
Oh my Catfish girl, Oh and every little thing that you do  
Oh Catfish girl, I only want to be with you.  
Oh Catfish come on now...  
Ain't' that the prettiest thing you ever did see.........  
  

Changing times, changing rules  
Make a wise man look a fool  
Gone before no longer here  
Look out for these signs of these  
Changing rules  
Better look out  
  
You better look out  
Look out for these changing times  
Can't stop those changing times  
Changing times  
Cold hard rain  
Everything's a changing  
Nothin's going to be the same  
  
You'd better look out  
'Cause you can't stop these changing times  
Nothin's going ever to be the same  
You'd better look out  
Look out for these changing times

Misty eyes on a misty day  
Come across a place like this along your way  
You walk straight in to that sweet and tender trap  
And you know you're lost and found  
And there ain't no going back  
Spend the rest of your life playing all the hardest games  
Just to get back to that place again  
And memories oh how they stick to you  
You know there ain't a thing, not a single thing you can do  
On chisel hill  
I've been ten thousand miles from this place and seen it I swear  
I've woke up happy thinking that I was there  
It's the place I love, it's where I wanna be  
And I won't give up until I get to see  
A little something in there to call my own  
Pass the time of day and head off home  
The evening shadows on the dry stone walls  
The night draws in and the ale house calls  
And happy I will be  
When the road goes no further than what I see  
When past here it's nowhere to go  
And I ain't gonna give up until I get see  
Those angel eyes looking up at me  
The prince of peace and time is standing still  
On chisel hill

I'm chained to the highway, there's no other way for me  
Always looking for a new day, always a dream ahead of me  
Seems like it's so many lifetimes, through the sunshine, rain and snow  
  
Yeah I come so far, but I still got so far to go  
Yes I come so far, but I still got so far to go  
  
Solo  
  
I'm gonna end up dyin' my body is listening for you  
But you may as well be gone already if you say dreams can't come true  
There's been good times there's been bad, but I still love the show  
  
Yeah I've come so far, but I still got so far to go  
Yeah I come so far, but I still got so far to go  
Yeah I come so far, but I still got so far to go  
Still got so far to go  
  
Solo  
  
Yeah I've come so far, but I still got so far to go

I'm coming off the ropes  
(He's going down)  
He thinks I'm beat  
I'm coming off the ropes yea  
This ain't no retreat  
He thinks I'm going down  
For sure my head is spinning round  
When I straighten up  
But I'm going to knock him off his feet!  
(Wow suckerpunch!  
  
I'm coming off the ropes  
(He's going down)  
Yes I'm coming off the ropes  
  
I'm coming off the ropes  
He made me angry now  
I only need to straighten up  
I'm going to show him how  
I can hear someone count to ten  
Seems like a lifetime,  
But I'll tell you when  
I know I'm safe down here  
So till then, must have been  
A lucky swing  
Two years ago,  
I would have not let him in  
  
I'm coming off the ropes  
(He's going down)

You got to break the back of the mold you were made in  
Crack the shell, that's how it's got to be  
Nothing for certain, ain't no way of knowing  
Only believe in things that you see  
  
Flow with the river, run with the tide  
Mix with your brother, 'cause he's right by your side  
Crack that mold  
  
Little pretty chicken you can't stay in there forever  
Now there ain't no such thing as only one kind of weather  
You got to bend, learn, take the rough with the smooth  
Understand everything  
Crack that mold  
  
Now there ain't no such thing as only one kind of weather  
  
Pick up them shoes, go running down that road  
You know that precondition is such a heavy load  
You got to live love, put down that written word  
Crack that mold  
  
Now there ain't no such thing as only one kind of weather

On the restless road to nowhere  
There's no certain peace it seems  
Desire to keep on moving  
Till the river of dreams  
Is it just because someone told you  
Is it just because you found  
Old freedom feels uneasy when duty is around  
  
When allegiance asks the questions  
Old freedom twists and turns  
And chokes on codes of honour  
On the sword of no return  
  
And it's the curse of the traveller  
The curse of the traveller  
Got a hold of me  
And it won't let you be  
  
And in sleepless nights  
You'll call her name  
And feel loneliness cold to the bone  
And when the daylight breaks  
This old tired heart aches  
To be such a long way, such a long way from home  
  
And you long for the harbourlights  
But you'll never be free  
Of the craving for refuge  
And the call of the sea  
Always wanting to sell up  
But always needing to buy  
So till the road leads to somewhere  
And that river runs dry  
  
It's the curse of the traveller  
Ain't gonna let you be  
The curse of the traveller  
And it sure got a hold of me

Sometimes I think I go insane  
So what's a boy supposed to do  
Working just to pay my way  
But baby when the day is through  
Just wanna have a good time  
Hey! I've got my shoe, shoes shined  
I'm gonna dance, dance, dance  
  
Walking down the city street  
They don't like the kind of stuff I play  
But feel that bass beneath your feet  
Man don't take my only life away  
Just wanna have a good time  
Hey! I've got my shoe, shoes shined  
I'm gonna dance, dance, dance  
I'm scared when I wake up sometimes it gets so fast  
I want it high and higher but it never lasts  
And all I have starts friday night with my first drink  
Don't tell me, don't say anything, don't wanna think  
Just wanna dance

Beat up soul  
Looking to find a smile  
Ain't nobody here to give you the reason why  
I need the wings of an angel  
Need to find me a way to fly  
  
Come on and dance with me baby  
Dancing my blues away  
Yeah dance with me baby  
Dance 'til my blues can't stay  
Come on and dance with me baby  
Dancing my blues away  
  
There is something worth knowing  
Written behind those eyes  
Well I've got tears by the truckload  
Let's laugh 'til they all run dry  
Let's steal the wings from those angels  
And kiss what we know goodbye  
  
Come on and dance with me baby  
Dancing my blues away  
Yeah dance with me baby  
Dance 'til my blues can't stay  
Come on and dance with me baby  
Dancing my blues away

Charlie was a loser till that sunny day  
No-one saw him leaving as he sailed away  
Treated like a sinner, no-one gave a damn  
Till Charlie threw two sixes  
Now he's got them in his hand  
  
Now they're waiting in line to go dancing with Charlie  
They want to be seen dancing with Charlie  
  
No-one seems to know how  
No-one seems to care  
Doesn't really matter just as long as you are there  
Party in the moonlight, free drinks at the bar  
You can bet what's in your pocket that Charlie won't be far  
Now they're waiting in line to go dancing with Charlie  
They want to be seen dancing with Charlie  
  
Charlie bought a jet plane, Charlie rides the sky  
Friends appear from nowhere, Charlie gets them high  
Big D was a gambler with everything to lose  
Charlie didn't have anything  
So he didn't have to choose  
  
And they're waiting in line to go dancing with Charlie  
They want to be seen dancing with Charlie  
And they're standing in line to go dancing with Charlie  
They want to be seen dancing with Charlie

All change on then merry go line  
Everybody looking for a sign  
Jumping up and down when the switch goes on  
Nobody knows where it's coming from  
  
I'm here watching, keeping well away  
Oh I'm gonna live it in my own way  
Singing no mister, not me  
I'm staying here with guys on free  
In deep water  
  
I see a captain on a distant shore  
He's got a dream, he wants to make it law  
He's got my number, he's got a plan  
He try to get you any way he can  
Wants to own everything he sees  
While I'm here, well he ain't with me  
Singing no mister, no way  
I got my own deep water  
Deep, deep water

I'm driving home for christmas  
Oh, I can't wait to see those faces  
I'm driving home for christmas, yea  
Well I'm moving down that line  
And it's been so long  
But I will be there  
I sing this song  
To pass the time away  
Driving in my car  
Driving home for christmas  
  
It's gonna take some time  
But I'll get there  
Top to toe in tailbacks  
Oh, I got red lights on the run  
But soon there'll be a three-way  
Get my feet on holy ground  
  
So I sing for you  
Though you can't hear me  
When I get trough  
And feel you near me  
I am driving home for christmas  
Driving home for christmas  
With a thousand memories  
  
I take look at the driver next to me  
He's just the same  
Just the same  
  
Top to toe in tailbacks  
Oh, I got red lights on the run  
I'm driving home for christmas, yea  
Get my feet on holy ground  
So I sing for you  
Though you can't hear me  
When I get trough  
And feel you near me  
Driving in my car  
Driving home for christmas  
Driving home for christmas  
With a thousand memories

E is for the comfort,  
You give to me  
E is for the peace, I feel inside  
E is for the good times  
That go against the bad times  
E is for the world you gave us  
And left us here behind  
They say  
Tell me what's so wrong with E  
That's what I hear them say  
Tell me what's so wrong with E  
That's what I hear them say  
Let's talk about it  
E is for the reason  
To live through urban grey  
E is for the warm glow,  
That takes the fear away  
Show us what is better  
Why don't you stand inside  
these shoes  
Oh live with me each Monday...  
Let's see what you would do...  
Which world do you live in?  
Which world did you choose?  
Hiding the tears, that's all  
No win  
No lose  
They say  
Tell me what's so wrong with E  
That's what I hear them say  
Tell me what's so wrong with E  
That's what I hear them say  
Let's talk about it

Well now come on easy rider  
Give me something  
For my pain  
Well now come on easy rider  
Though I know you're not to blame  
  
The dogs are out to get me  
And pull me down, again  
  
Well now come on easy rider  
Turn this screaming fire  
Down low  
Yeah come on easy rider  
Pull this pain  
And let it go  
  
This time around  
Don't think that I can take it  
This twisting pain  
I've come to know  
Easy rider  
Help me  
Easy rider

If you don't listen what the people say  
The people gonna have to take their own way  
You got to give the people what they need  
And only then will they begin to see  
  
There's a world that we don't know  
There's a world we never see  
Espresso  
  
I don't need this trouble, I don't need the grief  
I don't need to feel this pressure down on me  
Every day there's something we don't really need  
Stop, think, walk away and let it be  
Stop, think, walk away and let it be  
Espresso  
  
There's a world that we don't know  
There's a world we never see  
Espresso

The daylight breaks, a picture show of endless takes  
And the music's coming through on the radio  
And I take my place, reluctantly I join the race  
It's not my fight, just trying to stay on my feet  
But oh there's one thing that gets to me  
It's that little girl she puts me down so easily  
In total absurd I'm saying these words  
  
With every beat of my heart, I will love you  
With every song, with every breath that you take  
I'll give you the moon and the sun, you're the only one  
Pleading love with every beat of my heart  
  
With every beat of my heart, I will love you  
With every song, with every breath that you take  
I'll give you the moon and the sun, you're the only one  
Pleading love with every beat of my heart  
Pleading love with every beat of my heart

Every second counts  
That's what he says  
Every second counts  
Every single day  
All through the night time  
All through the day time  
Can't let your world pass through and into my way  
  
Every second counts  
He can't slow down  
Every second counts  
See him spin around  
He's chasing his shadow  
He's racing the wind  
He tells us to follow  
Where the ice is so thin  
  
I hope you're holding on  
I hope you're holding on  
'cause every second counts

They call me love  
They call me dear  
They kiss off and leave me  
For their own career  
I got a satellite dish, I'm all alone  
With my little goldfish  
And eminem, em on my headphones  
You heard that yet? You will!  
  
Selfish pigs put the blame on me  
So hacked off what I came to be  
I'm off the tracks  
Now I'm all at sea  
They like jogging more than they like me  
  
I'm evil  
Evil no.2  
  
Then need to have something,  
Becomes the seed to have anything  
The lonely tears have dried up  
And the brain cells start to fry  
My heart cries out for new things  
Turns to anything will do things  
My left sides like a train crash  
Form all the things I tried  
  
I was so scared  
I was lonely  
I got mixed up  
Now I'm only  
  
I'm evil  
Evil no.2  
  
Mummy and daddy's on prozac  
Said they're happy but  
They won't be back  
I hope they have a heart attack  
'cause of what they done to me  
  
They left me for a wine bar  
They left me for the wrong car  
I dunno how I got this far  
  
I'm evil  
Evil no.2  
  
Eminem ain't so far away from this  
  
Mummy got a boyfriend  
Daddy got a girlfriend  
Gotta go away at weekends  
I tell you what I'll do  
Take every pill that I see  
You can do what you want to me  
I'm only trying to break free  
From the evil that you do  
  
I'm evil  
Evil no.2

Go to that secret place  
Inside your soul  
Go to its deepest place  
Only you and I know  
Can you see her?  
There she is still shining bright  
When the sun goes down  
See her crimson glow through  
the darkest of nights  
She smiles and says  
Everything is alright  
There will never be goodbye  
While we still see the firefly  
  
The firefly  
She smiles and says  
Everything is alright  
There will never be goodbye  
While we still see the firefly  
  
There will never be goodbye  
While we still see the firefly

She's back real late yet she don't seem to care  
She hangs around outside in late night air  
Burning tears upon a smiling face  
And she's caught in the fires of spring  
  
The ice of loneliness you've known so long  
For good or not seems to have been and gone  
Your Phoenix flies you high on crazy wings  
And you're caught in the fires of spring  
  
You've been before but never been so fast  
Your only hope is that it's gonna last  
You know the pain and yet you love it's sting  
And you're caught in the fires of spring

A dying flame, you're free again  
Who could love and do that to you  
All dressed in black, he won't be coming back  
Save your tears, you've got years and years  
The pains of seventeen's  
Unreal they're only dreams  
Save your crying for the day  
  
Fool if you think it's over  
cause you said goodbye  
Fool if you think it's over  
I'll tell you why  
New born eyes always cry with pain  
At the first look at the morning sun  
You're a fool if you think it's over  
It's just begun  
  
Miss teenage dream, such a tragic scene  
He knocked your crown and ran away  
First wound of pride and how you cried and cried  
But save your tears you've got years and years  
  
Fool if you think it's over  
cause you said goodbye  
Fool if you think it's over  
I'll tell you why  
New born eyes always cry with pain  
At the first look at the morning sun  
You're a fool if you think it's over  
It's just begun  
  
I'll buy your first good wine  
We'll have a real good time  
Save your crying for the day  
That may not come but anyone  
Who had to pay would laugh at you and say  
  
Fool if you think it's over  
cause you said goodbye  
Fool if you think it's over  
I'll tell you why

Well if you want me then just take my hand  
And if you don't, I will understand  
It's just a call from deep within my soul  
The burning question, I have got to know  
  
Take a message from love to love  
Take it down, from love to love  
Girl it's you I'm thinking of  
I'll send this letter from love to love  
And if I ask you will you take this dance  
Please don't think you're taking some big chance  
It's just a fire and it burns for you  
You know there's one thing that you've got to do  
  
Take a message from love to love  
Take it down, from love to love  
Girl it's you I'm thinking of  
I'll send this letter from love to love  
  
I'll share your secrets on a rainy day  
Cause if you'll have me then we'll be away  
Oh there's a fire and it burns for you  
You know there's one thing that you've got to do  
  
Take a message from love to love  
Take it down, from love to love  
Girl it's you I'm thinking of  
I'll send this letter from love to love

Deep inside these old dusty walls  
There's a sacred heart, I'd know this garden anywhere  
She was warm, she was deep summertime  
She was love itself and she was standing there  
Standing close, so close to me  
I closed my eyes and I could see  
Giverny  
  
And in this strange and holy place  
I looked for love and found it everywhere  
It was what you saw she came to see  
Because of you she was standing there  
Giverny  
  
Books may burn and rain may fall  
But what is here I know will last forever more  
Colours change, there are no defines  
She was love itself and I thank you for giving me  
Giverny

I was never born with the face of a  
movie star  
I was never blessed with an easyload  
along the way  
I have taken the wrong turning  
So many times I can't remember  
But one thing I have for sure  
I can always smile and say  
  
God gave me an angel with a smiling  
face  
God gave me an angel this I know  
My churches are all empty and I'm guilty  
every day  
But god gave me an angel anyway  
  
Talk of being good and what became of  
me  
Do I hide my head in shame and turn  
away  
I have taken the wrong turning  
So many times I can't remember  
But one thing I have for sure  
I can always smile and say  
  
But God gave me an angel with a smiling  
face  
God gave me an angel this I know  
My churches are all empty and I'm guilty  
every day  
But god gave me an angel anyway

I'm going fishing  
I got me a line  
Nothin' I do's gonna' make the difference  
So I'm taking the time  
  
And you ain't never gonna' be happy  
Anyhow, anyway  
So I'm going fishing  
And I'm going today  
  
I'm going fishing  
Sounds crasy I know  
I know nothing about fishing  
But just watch me go  
  
And when my time has come  
I will look back and see  
Peace on the shoreline  
That could have been me  
  
You can waste whole lifetime  
Trying to be  
What you think is expected of you  
But you'll never be free  
  
May as well go fishing

She talks like thunder  
She really lets you know  
She keep changing the rules  
And leave you nowhere to go  
She bore you rigid with the party line  
She's so far left she's gonna get left behind  
  
He wants six pretty white spots on each side of the dice  
He wants it all to be equal but he needs to throw twice  
Now there's a guy in the corner with a smiling gaze  
He turns to me and says  
I'm gonna buy a hat  
'cause I think it's gonna rain  
Got caught out coming here  
Ain't gonna get caught again  
I'm gonna buy a big one  
Like that Mr Gorbachov  
And when it's raining all this crap  
Oh my hat will keep it off  
  
Now take a look at all them leaders  
Desperation in their eyes  
The tight faces smiles that cannot hide it  
They know no more than you or I  
  
So I'm gonna buy a hat  
'cause here they come again  
And when the start to blah-blah  
It's you and me that gets the rain

He's watching the girls on the dance floor  
He's watching the light in her hair  
He's praying that love's gonna come soon  
There's a sweet smell of hope in the air  
  
Just another boy from a steel town  
With the flash of the mill in his eye  
He don't move for hip cool or fashion  
But he knows where the deepest one lies  
  
And he'd love to be warm  
And he'd love to love you  
So give him some good news  
  
All the cards on the table  
But don't look that man in the eye  
Say a prayer for the dealer  
And kiss your old life goodbye  
  
Go to church light a candle  
But don't lose your head for God's sake  
Why is my heart beating faster  
Oh why do my hands start to shake  
  
'Cause he'd love to be warm  
And he'd love to love you  
So give him some good news

There's a crazy sense of duty  
As he licks between his fingers  
Wipes the ketchup from his face and hands  
There's a strong determination  
That his teachers never witnessed  
Never close enough to understand  
He's like a bull just bred for fighting  
He don't deliver nothing  
Outside the only thing that he knows  
  
School report just says he's lazy  
His brother says he's crazy  
But take a look 'cause there he goes  
  
Through the avenues of fashion  
To the palaces of dreams  
All the way down Guitar Street  
  
To some guitars are hot-rods  
All along the quest for macho  
To others a would-be ticket out of town  
For Joe a six-string sten gun  
In the 'Panto-revolution'  
And Stevie's all just strictly sound  
He's like a bull just bred for fighting  
He don't deliver nothing  
Outside the only thing that he knows  
  
School report just says he's lazy  
His brother says he's crazy  
But anyway take a look 'cause there he goes  
Through the avenues of fashion  
To the palaces of dreams  
All the way down Guitar Street

Have you heard the news  
That is going round  
He should know better  
  
Have you heard the news  
That boy's got dust for brains  
  
After all this time  
After all this time  
Now things, oh, can never be the same  
  
He should know better  
Always straight, always cool  
Endless style, nobody's fool  
And always with the grace and superb manner  
  
How he danced around the snakes  
Left them spinning in his way  
And stepped straight on the yellow skin banana  
  
He should know better  
  
In the early hours of day  
The black night  
He makes his way  
Regretfully into the morning fog  
  
Just one silly small mistake  
Now all his bones their gonna break  
To the curse and laughing smile  
Of the little green frog  
  
He should know better

All my friends packing up,  
Loading up their Volvo's  
And their pick up trucks  
Going down the road,  
To try their luck  
So spin that dream,  
Go heading for the city  
Roll that dice,  
Say a prayer,  
Light a candle for me  
When you get there,  
Win or lose,  
We're heading for the city  
  
Well I got a problem hear what I say  
They're telling me I got to move away  
I was happy here,  
They tell me I can't stay  
Now what's screaming rain is heading this way  
For those who sleep and choose to stay  
The game they didn't know  
They had to play  
So win or lose  
We're heading for the city  
So roll that dice  
Say a prayer  
Light a candle for me  
When you get there,  
Win or lose,  
We're heading for the city

I see a turning wheel  
On a dusty track  
Caught in the void and empty space  
In between there and back  
And the paradise of going somewhere  
That's still so far away  
Happy, boy you bet I am  
Holding on to this smile for just as long as I can  
  
Heaven  
  
It's all bright in front  
And it's all dark behind  
Livin' for the now that's in between the bridges and the signs  
And getting there is still a long long way to go  
While the others dream and wish  
This is everything I officially need to know  
Happy, boy you bet I am  
Holding on to this smile for just as long as I can  
  
Heaven

I stood out with my brother  
On a tree lined avenue  
I see the sweetest little creature  
Coming into my view  
And I say to myself, I say man I'm gonna get me some  
Of that bright little angel  
That shines like the morning sun  
Well my brother steps in, faster that light  
And he sweet talks this angel, clean out of sight  
  
I say hey you, you with that look in your eye  
Hey you, you with that look in your eye  
  
Well she moves like a river  
From her head down to her toes  
It's less a way of walking  
More a total flow  
And I say to myself, I wonder  
I wonder if she knows  
What she's doing to me and my brother  
From our heads down to our toes  
Well he's up there on the corner now  
He's playing up that Romeo like only he know how  
  
I say hey you, you with that look in your eye  
Hey you, you with that look in your eye  
Hey you, you that make the stars shine  
Hey you, you with that look in your eye

I see you laughing up at me, and i can't hide  
What it is that you can see  
I guess that's why  
I'm holding out my love for you  
And when you turn it around  
In different ways  
The answers turn around and fly away  
  
I see you laughing up at me  
And i can't hide  
What it is that you can see  
I guess that's why  
I'm holding out my love for you  
  
A lifelong history  
Of trust in vain  
I lead the fools' parade  
Out in the rain  
  
I see you laughing up at me  
''cause you don't seem to care  
But oh how happy i can be  
When you are there  
  
That's why i'm holding out  
My love for you

I may look like a stranger with nothing to say  
Silent in the corner while you're talking away  
Your theories are endless, your lips never sleep  
No time for reflection, there's no tongue in your cheek  
  
Oh no, I ain't fool here  
Oh no, I ain't fool here  
  
The muscles in your mouth must be stronger than steel  
You can talk till forever but ain't got no feel  
Your scull must be empty, your brain cells run dry  
Calling everybody  
Learning nothing till the day that you die  
  
Oh no, I ain't fool here  
Oh no, I ain't fool here

Now there's no storyline  
Just a real good time  
And I don't want to seem to be mistaken  
But there's a tale to tell  
On this road to hell  
It's in between the lines the case I'm making  
  
Oh, lord, look my way  
Save me from these crazy things I see  
I don't know what's going on round here these days  
But I can't dance to that  
Oh, I can't dance to that  
So let me dance to this  
'cause I can't dance to that  
  
If you'll excuse me please  
You see I got to go  
And take myself before I'm past redemption  
A voice is calling out  
As if I didn't know  
This wretched road is paved with good intentions  
All the way  
Down this Judas track  
I know it so well  
And I ain't going back  
I don't know what happened to the good time songs  
But I can't dance to that  
Oh, I can't dance to that  
So let me dance to this  
'cause I can't dance to that  
  
Tell me what you know  
Take away these chains  
What stood in front of me it looks so pretty  
But I can't dance to a cold machine  
Oh, lord, and every drummer you know just what I mean  
Oh, I can't dance to that  
So let me dance to this

I don't care anymore  
All the things i hear you say  
Don't care anymore  
You're always lying anyway  
Got a sweet little girl  
And it's such a sunny day  
I heard it all before  
Gonna hear it some more  
But you must understand one thing  
I don't care anymore  
  
I got a sweet little girl  
And it's such a sunny day  
I heard it all before  
Gonna hear it some more  
I don't care  
I don't care anymore

I just want to be with you  
No matter what they say  
Just want to be with you  
Every night and every day  
Cold nights, dark days  
I want to be with you  
  
I just want to be with you  
Till the final curtain falls  
Just want to be with you  
Then know nothing at all  
Cold nights, dark days  
I want to be with you  
want to be with you  
  
I know there's a price to pay  
For doing what we do  
But I just want to be with you  
Just want to be with you  
  
Don't want to hold you down  
Whatever that you do  
Shine on, sweet angel  
'cause I just want to be with you  
I want to be with you

I saw you coming  
With that poison in your hand  
Now you're acting kind of funny  
Like you don't seem to understand  
  
Stop complaining  
You've been caught fair and square  
I saw you coming  
I was guarding you that day  
  
I saw you coming  
Golden rule, you disobeyed  
You were too busy showing off  
How you gave yourself away  
  
Stop complaining  
You've been caught fair and square  
I saw you coming  
I was guarding you that day  
I saw you coming

I thought that I was going to lose you  
Just for a moment you looked like slipping away  
And my only thought was to come with you  
There was no other reason to stay  
Now I'm sinking in a river of happy returns  
Though I'm tired I can do nothing but sigh  
For the greatest relief I'm so thankful  
As I gaze at your coming-back smile  
  
Lord, I thought I was going to lose you  
Yes, I thought I was going to lose you

If you were me  
And I was you  
If you had to play my part out  
What would you do  
  
Two crazy stories,  
Two different views  
If you were me  
And I was you  
  
If you were me  
And I was you  
What kind of crazy things  
Would I have to do  
  
Who likes to party  
Who stays at home  
If you were me  
And I was you  
  
Never like strangers  
Though never the same  
Two circus side-shows  
And laughter in the rain  
  
You stay with the full moon  
You search for the stars  
Thank God it's heaven  
Here we both are  
  
If you were me  
And I was you  
If you had to play my part out  
What would you do  
  
Two crazy stories,  
Two different views  
If you were me, if you were me  
If you were me and I was you

I got my red shoes on  
Got my red gloves too  
Made my decision  
Gonna see this one through  
Too late, I can't stop now  
Open the door, I'll get through somehow  
  
Deep in my darkest night  
I always had a star that shone so bright  
Star of hope, shine on me  
I can take what comes my way  
Whatever goes down, whatever they say  
Star of hope shine on me  
  
'cause I'm ready  
Oh I'm ready  
  
Deep in my darkest night  
I always had a star that shone so bright  
Star of hope, shine on me  
I can take what comes my way  
Whatever goes down, whatever they say  
Star of hope shine on me  
  
'cause I'm ready  
Oh I'm ready

How many times  
Have I been here before?  
Like a worn away piece of the night  
Waiting for the dawn  
  
Daylight breaks  
And the dream is gone  
Leaving me to stay  
But I'm still holding on  
Yeah I'll keep holding on  
  
I used to think I knew  
Just exactly what I took  
You move in, fast and hard  
And you make your own luck  
  
Daylight breaks  
And the dream is gone  
Leaving me to stay  
But I'm still holding on  
  
I see it better now  
Smell the tears upon this tracks  
It's a long long way before it's over  
And what you give out  
Is what you get back  
The easy way out  
It will bite you hard someday  
You see me smile and learn  
I find a better way  
  
I'm still holding on

A careless heart ain't no good to no-one  
I was going back my friends to see  
Of what became of my childhood daydreams  
Of all the things that used to be  
To my surprise I stood alone  
I walked a river of a waking dream  
My father say 'Know what you're thinking'  
I guess this old town seen better days  
  
It's all gone  
Ain't nothing for you here now  
Sail on  
  
You talk of change, something better  
Cutting down that big old tree  
There's flesh and blood in there somewhere  
But no matter what you just don't seem to see  
I walk your chambers, your empty halls  
I see you talking behind the doors  
My father say 'Know what you're thinking'  
I guess this old town seen better days  
  
It's all gone  
Ain't nothing for you here now  
Sail on  
  
I'm sailing on, I'm running faster  
Than I ever run before  
My father say 'Know what you're thinking'  
I guess this old town seen better days  
Sail on

Soldiers of fortune lost in the wind  
No destinations and nothing to win  
Keep your head above the water, you get dirty and mean  
Scrubbing forever and you never come clean  
  
A life that is easy, a dream that comes true  
Flowers for someone but they sure ain't for me  
Your room's filled with soft light, safe and secure  
Mine is the dark night and nothing's for sure  
  
We're just passing trough  
  
A life that is easy, a dream to be free  
Flowers for someone but they sure ain't for you  
And they sure ain't for me  
  
We're just passing trough

Sweet September, I remember  
Eyes of August deepest blue  
While the lazy town was sleeping  
Strangest love that I ever knew  
Feel the wind blow, see the shadows  
Kiss the breeze of a sudden shore  
Of my life's loves and fascinations  
The only one who left me wanting more  
Little blonde plaits  
Drink to you love, drink to me love  
Sun burned feet on a dusty track  
Evening waves that turned in twilight  
Caught forever those little blonde plaits

Well we come down to the valley  
Yea we're looking for the honey  
I see a rainbow  
I say that's the land of milk and honey  
  
Me and my cousin  
Me and my brother  
My little sister too  
Come looking for a rainbow  
Yea we're looking for a rainbow  
  
Well we come down to the valley  
Got our babies in our arms  
Yea we're Maggie's little children  
And we're looking for Maggie's farm  
  
Me and my cousin  
Me and my brother  
My little sister too  
Come looking for a rainbow  
Yea we're looking for a rainbow  
  
Well we come down to the valley  
We ain't far away no more  
You can't leave us dying this time  
'cause we're all around your door  
  
Me and my cousin  
Me and my brother  
My little sister too  
Come looking for a rainbow  
Yea we're looking for a rainbow

Look deep into the April face  
A change is clearly taking place  
Looking for the summer  
  
The eyes take on a certain gaze  
And leave behind the springtime days  
Go looking for the summer  
  
This ain't no game of kiss and tell  
The implications how you knew so well  
Go looking for the summer  
  
The time has come and they must go  
To play the passion out that haunts you so  
Looking for the summer  
  
Remember love how it was the same  
We scratched and hurt each other's growing pains  
We were looking for the summer  
  
And still I stand this very day  
With a burning wish to fly away  
I'm still looking, looking for the summer

I could have stood to watch you walk away  
And put it down to your uncertain ways  
Or maybe baby you've had a change of heart  
Maybe want to make a brand new start  
Crazy though what I say may seem  
I could have learned to mend these broken dreams  
You could have pushed I would have gently fell  
I could have played the graceful one so well  
What's that you say  
You were gonna leave me anyway  
Any fool can see, see what you've done to me  
When your love turns to lies  
The actor played the part of sweet desire  
And tiptoed out upon the highest wire  
The truth to tell upon a rope too thin  
And so the fall of treachery begins  
But oh to see the starlet's smiling face  
So eagerly awaits to take the place  
I tried to fall in a clean and graceful way  
You could have said I would have given way  
And I see him smile the way that I smiled  
And I hear him laugh the way that I did  
But I hear him screaming and I hear him cry  
And I see him falling  
When your love turns to lies  
What's that you say  
You were gonna leave me anyway  
Any fool can see, see what you've done to me  
When your love turns to lies

When passion shines her blinding light on you  
You know my friend there's nothing that you can really do  
Just follow on behind her veil of deepest purple haze  
Down, to love's strange ways  
  
Drowning in a laughter as you go  
Intoxicating laughter that spins you high and low  
Dangerous times are these, but oh so wonderfully new  
Laugh along you fool, can't you they're laughing at you  
Lost in the haze  
Of love's strange ways  
  
Ain't it funny how it turns  
When it's all over, nothing's learned  
Just a passion and a fool  
And a memory that burns  
And that's what you get  
When you play with love's strange ways

The night was black with thunder  
The streets were wet with rain  
Another day goes under  
A little bourbon will take the strain  
And I'm waiting for my take-home French fries  
She smiled and said 'take me away'  
We always laughed but I think she means it  
But I'm dreaming my life away  
Loving you  
Loving you the way that I do  
  
The weekend cars are leaving  
In a spray of wind and sound  
The bar-talk, make believing  
And the drinks go easy down  
It's back to the all-night take-away  
She says 'Here comes the man of my dreams'  
We always laugh but I think she means it  
And I'm spending my time  
Just loving you  
Loving you the way that I do

It's been so long now since we first met  
But the time and place I will never forget  
Darling, never  
  
Trough good and bad we stood the tested time  
You say I'm yours and darling you're still mine  
Forever  
  
So smile for me  
'Cause it's there for all to see  
After all this time  
Through the rain and tears  
After all this time  
After all these years  
I'm only loving you again  
  
And I'll keep holding on girl I won't let go  
I want you near me where ever I go  
Please say, forever  
  
And I give thanks for what you've given me  
And in my heart girl there'll always be  
A light  
That shines through the darkest night  
After all this time  
Through the rain and tears  
After all this time  
After all these years  
I'm only loving you again  
  
So smile for me  
'Cause it's there for all to see  
After all this time  
Through the rain and tears  
After all this time  
After all these years  
I'm only loving you again  
  
Through the rain and tears  
Till the sun dries up the sea  
Till the rivers they run dry  
I'm gonna be loving you again

I got my money  
I got it here in my hand  
OK let me tell you  
This is how we stand  
I've waited so long  
Good things, never too late  
So don't take no chances  
Leave nothing to faith  
  
I want to walk tall in midnight blue  
Look good, oh so good  
Step out in midnight blue  
Midnight blue  
  
I watch the razors with their class and their style  
Dressed to kill, man  
Their lives is just one great big smile  
And oh I want to be there  
When they dish that stuff out  
Cool and collected  
Man that's what it's all about  
  
So gimme, gimme, gimme  
I want midnight blue  
I love midnight blue  
I'm gonna step out in midnight blue  
So gimme, gimme, gimme midnight blue  
Midnight blue  
I walk tall in midnight blue  
Look good, oh so good  
In midnight blue

The weak and hazy shades of winter sun  
Come shining through  
Lifting fog from the trees and a gentle warm breeze  
Send it up in to the blue  
  
Blue sky and you come creeping through my soul  
Goodbye our love's smoking too  
And the sound of those Italian engines  
Is much more the sound of you  
  
Miles was a cigarette smoky and long  
Gonna miss what I never had  
Now that cigarette is gone

Nashville sky, in the morning sun  
Somewhere up north, a new life begun  
He was drawn to the twister, with a Memphis sound  
Kissed by an Angel, of a music town.  
  
Jump a train from Chicago, trace it back  
With the neck of a bottle, and the groove of the tracks  
Spend your life running, that Angels sweet sound  
Chasing the ghosts, of a faraway town.  
  
Oh Mississippi, running through my veins  
Oh Mississippi, never the same again.

I'll see you round about midnight  
You know I won't be late  
Let's dive into this crap house  
And truth hell have to wait  
  
The truth of what has gone before  
Lies bleeding on the floor  
The only truth remaining still  
Is that truth don't matter anymore  
  
So meet me round about midnight  
I won't let you down I swear  
We'll hang on to each other  
Down at the new Times Square  
  
It seems that we can't run from this  
No matter how we try  
There's nothing here worth keeping  
So let's kiss it all goodbye  
  
Tell me what's worth keeping anyway  
It doesn't seem to matter  
What we do or what we say  
Everything we had  
They have now taken it all away  
The truth don't matter anymore

I go to work in a bubble  
I got everything I need  
I get so high on no trouble  
It's a great feeling, being free  
I say a prayer at thanksgiving  
I bless the night and the day  
I look up to the sky with a smile on my face  
And I praise the lord of the new way  
The sweetest sound I ever knew  
Was the sound of reason falling  
Like the summer rain  
And the truth washed the pain away  
New way  
I don't watch tv anymore  
Don't need to see it now we all know the score  
And all the politicians know what they're there for  
It's a new way  
New way  

She's standing by the waterside, she's waiting for her man  
On the evening wind, she hears the whistle blow  
It's coming from the factory, she hears it every day  
Her soft cheeks flush, he's on his way  
  
They're going where the sun is shining  
They're going for that silver lining  
They're gonna work and make it pay  
  
And she say 'mmm, well, one fine day  
Spread those wings, fly away'  
Now I don't lie, no, cold wind and rain  
Gonna sail away one fine day  
  
Now hope, it springs eternally  
At least that's what they say  
Boy, it gets hard to feel that way  
  
When he sees his little darling hide  
The tear with a smile  
He say 'come here baby, now don't you cry'

There's a heart in the middle of somewhere tonight  
Screaming for reasons or just a way out  
I put the shirt off my back on a wager that says  
There's one every night from my old school yard days  
I hear you say one golden rule  
One golden rule  
  
There's been times I've been stood in the wind and the rain  
Freezing and busted and tricked out of luck  
And I cursed my teachers for all of their reading  
What we needed most can't be found in them books  
One golden rule  
  
Now they teach you to swim but they don't speak of the danger  
Tell you the truth but they never say why  
Put you on ice that is thin and tell you it's winter  
Without one golden rule the truth is a lie  
One golden rule

Heartbeat, way down on Cove Street  
Playing to lady luck, awaiting that tender touch  
Fantasy is the trick of the dance you see  
Hiding that need for love and wanting you close to me  
  
Oh that one sweet and tender touch  
That's what I'm missing and need so much  
One sweet and tender touch  
  
Bright light  
Pretty colors that shine on all through the night  
I don't need them, not half as much  
As I'm wanting your tender touch  
And loneliness makes the strongest heart a wilderness  
That's wilder than you see, is wanting you close to me  
  
For that one sweet and tender touch  
That's what I'm missing and need so much  
One sweet and tender touch

I was down, nowhere bound  
Needed love, any love  
Something new, breezy and bashful but true  
Changing my whole point of view  
Suddenly someone, a midnight romancer  
A Romeo dancer in blue  
But only with you  
Only with you  
  
No more rain, no more chains  
No more cold lonely sleepless nights  
Laughing eyes, wider than midsummer skies  
Crazy but don't ask me why  
Suddenly someone, a midnight romancer  
A Romeo dancer in blue  
But only with you  
Only with you  
  
Once a Lone Star rider who danced in super cool  
Now a Romeo, it's true  
But only with you  
Only with you

Rain, tears of joy, tears of pain  
Is this really me  
Standing here at the station  
The card said I mustn't be late  
I've never been late  
I've never really had the chance  
Years and years and not even wanting a second chance  
'Look for a raincoat and a rose'  
  
I hope no one sees, they'll laugh I know  
He was always like that, yes it always showed  
Did I do something wrong to have to pay  
In many more ways than one  
Rainy day, what do I say  
How simple it's all become  
  
Love is for fools and fools have no grace  
Damn them while you can  
Out here on the fence is such a lonely place  
I wish I was foolish now  
The greatest of pain is never really knowing  
Maybe today I'll find out this way  
The way that I'm going

Set my sails out on a sunny day  
Pretty soon i was on my way  
Though what for sure it was  
I could not say  
  
Two thousand reasons  
Maybe more  
Eight hundred chances on faraway shores  
Searching for something  
Searching for more  
Deep down inside me burning  
Reasons for the learning  
  
Now you can pick up reasons so easily  
Where you've been and where you've got to be  
And when the truth don't show you'll always see  
Lots of reasons  
  
And pretty soon you've got a heavy load  
Dragging those reasons down an endless road  
I got to thinking and i got to see  
So many reasons coming at me  
  
The one that leaves you high and dry  
He says you still owe him, there's a reason why  
He'll leave you crying till the tears run dry  
He's the one, always the one with all the reasons  
So many reasons the come and they go  
The reasons for them i'll never know  
I've seen so many, they've come and they've gone  
I've turned all mine in and i'm happy with one  
  
So don't talk of friendship, do it to me  
Make me an offer and make it for free  
Don't give me reasons ''cause i wrote that song  
I only want love now so i'll just take the one

Put your hand in the paintbox and choose  
Which one says the most about you  
I would have to pick the deepest shade  
The saddest shade of blue  
But red is colour I'd choose  
Red is colour I'd choose  
  
I set my soul long ago and far away  
Oh it's written down so deep it can never fade away  
Though so many years have come and gone  
Through my life one thing has stayed  
An eternal light that shines clean through the grey  
  
Red is colour I'd choose  
Deepest red on a sky of deepest blue  
It don't matter now if I should win  
If I should win or lose  
'cause red is colour I'd choose  
If I waste my time away waiting just for you  
I don't care what others say  
'cause baby I just love, love what you do  
  
Red is colour I'd choose  
Deepest red on a sky of deepest blue  
It don't matter now if I should win  
If I should win or lose  
'cause red is colour I'd choose

Sandwriting  
Leave your name and  
Let the wind  
And high tide  
Take it away  
Each white gold grain  
That made up your name  
  
Take it away  
  
Sandwriting  
Write your lover's monogram  
Upon the cool damp  
White gold grain  
say this is who I am  
Yes this is all you are my friend  
Some shapes upon the sand  
Of white gold grain  
Washed and blown away  
With the memory of your name  
  
Take it away  
  
Go tell the story  
To the wind and sea  
What ever became of you and me  
Each letter of love  
That had its golden day  
A love song  
Without goodbye  
  
Take it away  
  
Sandwriting

Oh you've been so long  
In the shadows of the big man  
How long can you take it  
How far can you go  
Don't you know how strong  
In the shadows of the big man  
While he smiles in the sunlight  
You can die in the cold  
  
Spend your life, In the shadows of the big man  
Sell your wife and children, if it made him smile  
How long can you take it, or do you really need it!  
Oh standing in the shadows, the shadows of the big man  
And you'd love all the world to see  
How you break your chains and set yourself free  
And all you got to do is walk away  
Walk away from the shadows of the big man

In waves of people you can lose your feet  
You've got to stay hard, to the ground  
It gets so easy now to lose your way  
When you're ever outward bound  
A church bell ringing in the fading light  
Stops you dead like a cold steel wall  
The ghost of yesteryear's is toughing you  
And as sure as God you'll fall  
And I see me and I see you  
I see it all just like it used to be  
And all the reasons why it started out  
Hit you hard with every bell  
The choir practice in the empty hall  
Is a sound that you know so well  
Like something lost inside your overcoat  
You find it later, by mistake  
You lost it all a thousand years ago  
And you pray it's not too late  
And I see me and I see you  
I see it all just like it used to be  
And I see me and I see you  
I see it all just like a diary  
  
Now I remember everything  
Yea I remember how it used to be  
With every note that choirboy sings  
And I see me and I see you  
I see it all just like it used to be

She closed her eyes  
And let the walls of her prison fall away  
The walls that ached with a timeless wait  
They had become her walls of this modern tv life  
She closed her eyes  
And let them fall away  
And in her dreams she is standing by an ocean  
She is gazing out to sea  
She can remember with just a fleeting glimpse  
That she was once free  
So long ago now, so long it was as if it had never been  
Was it a holiday  
She thinks it could have been, ah yes, italy  
  
And he closes his eyes  
And he is gone far away  
Gone from all the confusion  
Gone from all the pain  
He can easily see what a pointless waste  
His modern life has become  
Chasing the gravy grain  
Chasing the dollar  
Chasing the clock  
Chasing his male friends  
Chasing the boss  
Chasing as it was everything  
It was nothing  
  
Only the sound of his own breathing was all he had  
At the end of the day  
And reasons to wonder, reasons to cry  
Too late for this selfish sinner who never asked why

She gave away all her love  
No reason to keep it  
She'd saved it for only one  
But he didn't need it  
And downtown the midnight circus  
Hypnotised like a spinning top  
Offering dreams, like the gloss magazines  
She had so much to give so she gave it away  
  
And all of the loves you've known  
There must have been someone  
Who gave you that starry night  
And whose gonna point the finger  
Only those who never known  
She lost and she cried, the tears run dry  
She had so much to give so she gave it away  
  
Mary was like you and I  
She remembers how she lay with him  
But to the world she's just a drunken cheap trick  
Red light side kick, an angel downtown  
  
The priest calls her Wednesdays  
And shows her a wooden cross  
He tells of the love he's found  
She thinks of the one she lost  
And downtown the midnight circus  
Hypnotised like a spinning top  
So easy to choose when there's nothing to lose  
She had so much to give so she gave it away

There's a light shining on her window  
There's a great big guess breathing on her door  
Shame it's taken all this time  
All these years to find out  
She's gonna change everything  
  
I spend so much time sitting in shadows  
I feel naked to the bone but I don't care, any more  
Shame it's taken all this time  
All these years to find out  
She's gonna change everything  
  
Oh everybody can't you see  
What that angel's done to me  
I'm hopelessly in bits  
Hanging on to what I think I used to be  
Somebody help me please  
See this fool way down on his knees  
She's gonna change everything you see in me  
She's gonna change everything

And now the day is over  
And the shadows start to grow  
The sun has done us well today  
In flaming crimson he explodes  
And bursts of million colours  
That spill across the sky  
I turn and look at you love  
And i know the reason why  
Such a long time  
Like good wine  
Getting better every day  
Now you know, i'll never go  
So you'll always stay  
  
And our love will keep on shining  
Through the wind and the rain  
And when the day is over  
Our love will shine again  
And as the years fly over  
I'm feeling younger every day  
The love that you have given me  
Is more than i can say  
  
Shine, shine, shine

The gas-lamp flickers in the night  
And jingle-jangles in the wind  
The pool-hall cowboys play and play  
'cause pool-hall hot shots don't go home  
And a lonely breeze sends shivers  
From a distant shore  
Since I don't see you anymore  
  
The morning curtains gently sway  
A gap throws light across the room  
You curse that noisy radio  
Even when you turn it down  
It tells us bad news of a distant war  
And I don't see you anymore  
Since I didn't see you  
Since I didn't see you  
Since I don't see you anymore  
  
No me da un bledo si senor  
Since I don't see you anymore  
I've always got time for one more  
Since I don't see you anymore  
And a lonely breeze sends shivers  
From a distant shore  
And the tears fall faster now love  
Much more than before  
Since I don't see you anymore

There's a smile on the faces I see  
Since I found you  
There's a laugh in the eye, where a tear used to be  
Since I found you  
There's a sound of a Memphis section playing on my radio  
And it sings of the reasons why I love you so  
Since I found you  
  
There's a groove that's so smooth  
I can hardly tell who's in the studio  
And the girls on the street  
Sing out of tune so sweet  
I just have to go, it's all I need to know  
Since I found you, I ain't never going to give you up  
Since I found you, you keep me looking up  
You keep me looking up  
You keep me looking up  
Turn it up

Sing a song of love to me  
As the shadows start to grow  
And I won't be sad and lonely  
Anymore  
  
'Cause if you sing a song of love to me  
I will always find a smile  
That will warm my cold cold heart  
Just for a while  
  
Songs of love  
I know so well  
I've seen some days  
And had some times  
Lucky boy I can hear you say  
You think my sun does nothing but shine  
  
Sing a song of love to me  
One more time before I go  
And I won't be sad and lonely  
No I won't be sad and lonely  
Anymore

Soft top, hard shoulder  
See me running down that line  
I can't stop too much older now  
Let it run in overtime  
Run till it breaks up  
Overheats and explodes  
Pick up what's left of me  
Leave the rest of it way down that road  
  
Soft top, hard shoulder  
  
Soft top, hard shoulder  
Step in to the flame  
Blue center, so much colder  
Won't be the same again  
  
I'm gonna run till it breaks up  
Overheats and explodes  
Pick up what's left of me  
Leave the rest of it way down that road  
Soft top, hard shoulder

Someday  
My peace will come  
Oh I know  
My peace will come  
  
I will sleep like a child without pain  
Without fear  
Like a smile in the afternoon sun  
Oh someday  
  
My peace will come  
Lord can you hear me  
Oh I know you know my name  
It's written in the tears  
That flow from my pain  
  
Broken hearted broken soul  
All my life on the run  
But someday  
Yeah someday  
  
My peace will come  
Someday  
My peace will come

Well she thinks she's looking so cool  
She thinks she's great but she's just a fool  
What awful lack of class makes this kind behave this way  
I look and only think of one thing to say  
Soup, she's just soup  
Soup of the day  
  
She's thin around the waistline  
Thin around the brain  
You see this type so many times  
Time and time again  
  
How could they really think  
They'd be treated in any other way  
Everybody's looking and everybody say  
Soup, she's just soup  
Soup of the day  
  
Well you'd think they'd know better  
That behaving in this way  
They think they're being clever  
But I really have to say  
You'd better think it over  
You'll regret it one fine day  
When the circus party's over  
And you were just soup of the day  
She's just soup  
Soup of the day

He's a square peg in a round hole  
Misfit in a slick world  
Don't play the game  
Don't do what he's told  
He's a square peg in a round hole  
  
Square peg don't care  
The bright lights he's not there  
Catch the shadows see him slip away  
Square peg that's what they say  
Square peg, Square peg  
  
Square peg, you have got to be strong  
Square peg, he's got his own song  
Square peg, I'll see you around  
Square peg, face down  
  
Square peg, round hole

Some girls used to kiss and run  
Never knew what they had done  
Some girls always wasted time  
Keep you hanging on the line  
Some loved horses and always stayed at home  
But a Stainsby girl loved the Rolling Stones  
  
Now some had games that you had to play  
Making rules along the way  
Strange attractions newly found  
Pride and passion kicked around  
Some girl stole your heart  
Like most girls do  
But a Stainsby girl, she could break it in two  
  
And I fell in love, I fell in love  
I fell in love with a Stainsby girl  
  
Deepest water Stainsby blue  
Running straight, and running true  
Names and faces fade away  
Memory here to stay  
  
Some girls steal your heart  
Most still do,  
But a Stainsby girl, she could break it in two  
  
I fell in love, I fell in love  
I fell in love with a Stainsby girl

There'll be no moon tonight  
And the stars won't light the sky  
There are women on the streets,  
But there's no loving in their eyes  
Feeling weary, tired and wishing  
I was standing in your doorway now  
There'll be dancing flames  
Something special cooking slow  
Perfume heavy and all the lanterns turned down low  
Oh that lucky, oh that lucky man  
Who is standing in your doorway now  
I'm a wandering man  
You'll never tie me down  
Lifelong sailor, but how I wish I was homeward bound  
At this moment tired and wishing  
I was standing in your doorway now

I was born and raised on steel river  
I see it all like it was yesterday  
The ships and bridges they were all delivered  
From Sydney harbour to the Cisco bay  
  
And I met my love down on steel river  
We served our dreams and spent our childhood days  
In rainy streets we'd kiss away the shivers  
And hide from fear inside the latest craze  
  
Dancing to Motown  
Making love with Carole King record playing  
And oh how I loved you  
Say goodbye steel river  
  
Ten thousand bombers hit the steel river  
And many died to keep her running free  
And she survived but now she's gone forever  
Her burning heart is just a memory  
  
And I ran away from life on steel river  
Luck or not I gladly took the break  
The odds were low the chances nearly zero  
A chance it was I had to take  
Say goodbye steel river  
  
They say that salmon swim in steel river  
They say it's good to see them back again  
I know it hurts to see what really happened  
I know one salmon ain't no good to them  
  
They were born and raised to serve their steel mother  
It was they taught and all they ever knew  
And they believed that she would keep their children  
Even though not a single word was true  
Say goodbye steel river

I'm gonna stick by you, everyday  
I won't let you down now  
No matter what they say  
I won't let them get to you, no way  
I'll stick by you  
I'm going to stick by you  
Now I know  
No matter what tomorrow brings  
I won't let you go  
I won't let them get to you, oh no  
  
I'll stick by you  
And when the laughter seems to fade away  
And Mr Sun becomes a rainy day  
Oh I don't matter cause you'll know anyway  
I won't let you down  
I'm gonna stick by you  
I'll stick by you  
  
Going to stick by you, now I know  
No matter what tomorrow brings  
I won't let them get to you, no  
I'll stick by you, I'll stick by you  
I'll stick by you, I'll stick by you

The steel mill closes down tonight  
As the dying embers fade  
And all the guys are too tired for tears  
Checking their final pay  
  
Those razored sabres of steel they made  
They never got to hold  
So many sold, millions  
Silence in the bar tonight  
  
And some aren't even here  
And red eyes gaze uncertainly  
Deep down into their beer  
And the Holy Ghost surrounds you with faith  
  
And peace of mind  
And love is all around you everywhere  
  
Stick it  
Stick it out  
  
We're sure if you try  
You'll get by  
Find a way  
  
Stick it  
Stick it out  
  
We're sure if you try  
You'll get by  
Find a way  
  
They tell you it's all over  
They don't need you anymore  
You hear him shout "bring the next one in"  
As you're walking out the door  
  
Decisions for so many dictated by so few  
A free man for the first time  
What are you gonna do now  
  
Stick it  
Stick it out  
  
We're sure if you try  
You'll get by  
Find a way

I see a million torn up moments  
Of the rarest happiness  
Each one a dancing snowflake  
A piece of memory  
  
It's the ghost of days gone by  
Lay them tight across this old town  
In the silence of your smiling face  
You move to me  
  
And you are still beautiful  
You are still beautiful  
In this cold white night  
Still shining bright  
Still beautiful  
  
Regrets the cold wind that I know  
And it will not let me be  
And hopes your smiling face  
Can still can set me free  
  
And you are still beautiful  
You are still beautiful  
In this cold white night  
Still shining bright  
Still beautiful

Gone too far  
Gone too long  
Messed it up completely  
Till everything is wrong  
Stop, start over, start again  
Too many pieces  
Too much to chew  
How can you ever win  
When you're so scared to loose  
You better stop, start over, start again  
Stop, start over, start again  
Walk away  
See what it looks like from here  
If you stay you will only drown  
If a mass of fear  
You need to sleep  
You need a break  
You got to find out before it's to late  
Stop, start again  
You better stop, start over, start again  

Once there was a summer love  
Long ago and far away  
The autumn whispers to the falling leaves  
Summer love can't stay  
  
This was their place, this was where  
Just for one moment, without cares  
Two lovers dreaming of how the world should be  
Please bring back my summer love to me  
  
Did you have to go, did I have to stay  
Did you have to go, away  
Now it's all gone, but who can forget  
Summer love, sweet summer love  
  
I see your shadow everywhere  
I feel your smile though you're not there  
A kiss for every star in the sky way above  
You'll always be my one and only summer love

I lie awake, late at night  
I just don't seem to sleep at all  
Got so high, don't I know why  
Said man I got that Moon-dog call  
Stepping out into the street  
  
Gonna dance till my legs fall off  
Mister policeman say "what's wrong with you  
Why you behaving this way?"  
I said I'm hung on her sweet kiss  
  
My mama told me that the day would come  
So I don't need no alibi  
The judge looked down with a pointed frown  
And said "boy you got to explain why"  
Out on the street, late at night  
Dancing like a crazy fool  
Laughing and singing, what's wrong with you?  
Why you behaving this way?  
I said I'm hung on her sweet kiss  
  
And all the boys they're gonna laugh  
And all the girls gonna talk in class  
But I don't care, there's just no way  
I'm gonna let this feeling fade away  
I said I'm hung on her sweet kiss

I want to see the blue sky  
I want to feel the breeze  
I want to hear the summer wind  
Singing in the trees  
I want to touch forever  
And drift into its soul  
Put my troubles in my right hand  
Hold them up  
And let them go!  
  
Sweet summer day  
Talking about a sweet summer day  
Take your troubles and let them fly away  
I'm talking about a sweet summer day  
  
So much time is wasted, pulling the line  
For sure you are running faster  
But you're only running blind  
I want to touch forever  
I want to really know  
Put my troubles in my right hand  
Hold them up and let them go  
  
Sweet summer day  
I'm talking about a sweet summer day  
Take your troubles and let them drift away  
Talking about a sweet summer day

Je veux sentir le sable  
Entre mes doigts de pieds  
Tamatave ma petite rouquine  
Elle la sait  
  
Long grass dancing in the day  
Blue sky palm trees gently sway  
I come from a land down in sun  
Sit on the beach and watch the waves run  
  
I need the sand between my toes  
Tamatave my red hair girl she knows  
  
Tamatave je t'entends m'appeler  
Tamatave je t'entends m'appeler  
Tommasina I hear you calling me  
Tamatave je t'entends m'appeler  
  
I feel so strange on city streets  
I got these big shoes on my feet  
I come from a land down in sun  
Sit on the beach and watch the waves run  
  
Tamatave je ton ton mapelay  
Tamatave je ton ton mapelay  
Tommasina I hear you calling me  
Tamatave je ton ton mapelay

I'm a boat without an ocean  
I'm a boat without a wave  
I'm a sail without a strong wind  
And I want someone to save, to save me  
  
Teach me to dance  
  
I'm a car without a driver  
I'm a plane without a wing  
I see you standing by my doorway  
But I don't know how to let you in  
  
Teach me to dance  
  
I've been watching too much tv  
I can't feel myself no more  
I'm tired of all those macho movies  
That ain't what this life is for  
  
I don't want to hurt nobody  
Just laughing, that's how I wanna be  
Cause when that brick goes through that window  
It don't make nobody free  
  
Teach me to dance

The little girl she said to me  
What are these things that I can see  
Each night when I come home from school  
And mama calls me in for tea  
  
Oh every night a baby dies  
And every night a mama cries  
What makes those men do what they do  
To make that person black and blue  
  
Grandpa says their happy now  
They sit with God in paradise  
With angels' wings and still somehow  
It makes me feel like ice  
  
Tell me there's a heaven  
Tell me that it's true  
Tell me there's a reason  
Why I'm seeing what I do  
  
Tell me there's a heaven  
Where all those people go  
Tell me they're all happy now  
Papa tell me that it's so  
  
So do I tell her that it's true  
That there's a place for me and you  
Where hungry children smile and say  
We wouldn't have no other way  
  
That every painful crack of bones  
Is a step along the way  
Every wrong done is a game plan  
To that great and joyful day  
  
And I'm looking at the father and the son  
And I'm looking at the mother and the daughter  
And I'm watching them in tears of pain  
And I'm watching them suffer  
  
Don't tell that little girl  
Tell me  
Tell me there's a heaven  
Tell me that it's true  
Tell me there's a reason  
Why I'm seeing what I do  
  
Tell me there's a heaven  
Where all those people go  
Tell me they're all happy now  
Papa tell me that it's so

In the morning madness and the stabbing light  
She pours the coffee and she says  
"What was wrong with you last night?"  
"Dreams, just dreams my love, we're half asleep"  
But the headline's on tennis  
So it seems, everything's all right  
There's a girl from the Midwest, with a pretty face  
Scratched where it itched, they said it was a disgrace  
"I don't want to go to work today  
want to stay at home and watch that girl play"  
Do you like tennis?  
Yes I do  
  
There are people in boats in the middle of the sea  
Crying and dying like Jews  
Do you like tennis?  
Freedom is the man with the red grenade  
She ran out of gas, got beat and raped  
Do you like tennis?  
Well do you like tennis?  
Yes I do

Warm winds blowin'  
Heat 'n' blue sky  
And a road that goes  
Forever...  
  
Been thinkin' 'bout it lately  
Been watchin' some TV  
Been lookin' all around me  
and what has come to be  
Been talkin' to my neighbor  
And he agrees with me...  
It's all gone crazy  
  
Well, my wife returns from takin'  
My little girl to school, she got  
Beads of perspiration  
As she tries to keep her cool  
She says "Unless it don't get no better,  
there's gonna come a day,  
someone's gonna get killed out there"  
And I turn to her and say, "Texas"  
She says "What?"  
"They got big long roads out there".  
  
Warm winds blowin'  
Heat 'n' blue sky  
And a road that goes  
Forever...  
I'm goin' to Texas. (one,two,three)...  
  
We gotta get outta here  
We gotta get outta here  
  
Well I got a little brother  
Several meters high  
Yeah, he's built just like a quarterback  
And he swears he'll testify.  
He says he's been to Texas  
And that's the only place to be  
Big stakes, big cars, no trouble here  
That's the place for me  
I'm going to Texas (yeah, yeah)  
I'm going to Texas (yeah, yeah)  
I'm going to Texas  
  
Watch me walkin'  
Watch me walkin'  
Watch me walkin'

Catch a sight of long lost summers  
Catch a dream inside your hands  
Take me where that lady comes from  
Take me to that far off distant land  
Rain comes pouring past my window  
Turns my sky from blue to grey  
I ain't never been to Texas  
But I sure gonna meet that lady  
One fine day  
  
When Texas smiles around my bedroom  
Who could ever turn her down  
Tears of joy roll down my pillow  
While cold north winds are blowing all around me  
But I don't care, my dream is westbound  
Far across that sky so grey  
  
I ain't never been to Texas  
But I sure gonna meet that lady  
One fine day  
  
She's my little Texas  
My little Texas

There's a time and place everywhere I go  
Where the river meets the sea  
Somewhere between the gates of dreams  
And the turning of the key  
There's a cutting edge there's a real fine line  
And it's caught in come and go  
And you're leaving what you thought you knew  
To what you've come to know  
When the twilight turns at the end of day  
And the angels kiss the moon  
There's a diamond sun everywhere she goes  
And there ain't no other way  
I'm gonna dream tonight  
By that pale moonlight  
Till the morning comes my way  
  
I'm walking tall  
And I'm walking fine  
And I'm up there  
With that girl of mine  
  
And I'm standing in the twilight now  
Yeah I'm standing by her side  
Oh I'm gazing in that gate of dreams  
Underneath that midnight sky  
Cause there's a diamond sun everywhere she goes  
And there ain't no other way  
I'm gonna dream tonight  
By that pale moonlight  
Till the morning comes my way  
  
I'm walking tall  
And I'm walking fine  
And I'm up there  
With that girl of mine

It don't look good,  
It don't look great  
You know what's going down you really gonna hate  
This is the moment, you know the score  
This is what your enemies have waited for  
You're going down  
And everybody knows, that's the way it goes  
Take a look, there ain't no doubt about it  
You're in real bad shape  
Everything that you don't need  
Is waiting at your garden gate  
So take a smile, take a woe  
You got the rest of your life to wonder why and how  
Save that for later, you're far too busy now  
Because  
You're going down  
And everybody knows  
That's the way it goes

At the first bell of the day  
They rise up from where they lay  
And look down with the promise in their hands  
A promise to get out  
This ain't what it's all about  
There's always lots of reasons for their plans  
When that golden sun shines through  
There's always one more thing to do  
Just one more stab into the wishing well  
  
That's what they always say  
I'm getting out  
That's what they always say  
Ain't that just what they always say  
That's what they always say  
Just one more little thing left in my way  
That's what they always say  
Ain't that just what they always say  
  
I'm getting out, I'm holding on  
I'm hanging in, the time is wrong  
And every morning brings another reason  
A piece of cake, no lion share  
Just one more dice and you'll be there  
That golden bridge is just around the bend  
  
That's what they always say  
I'm getting out  
That's what they always say  
Ain't that just what they always say  
That's what they always say  
Just one more little thing left in my way  
That's what they always say  
Ain't that just what they always say  
  
Tomorrow is another day  
The money junkie fades away  
That golden bridge is just around the bend  
  
That's what they always say  
I'm getting out  
That's what they always say  
Ain't that just what they always say  
That's what they always say  
Just one more little thing left in my way  
That's what they always say  
Ain't that just what they always say

My world is miles of endless roads  
That leaves a trail of broken dreams  
Where have you been  
I hear you say?  
  
I will meet you at the Blue Cafe  
Because, this is where the one who knows  
Meets the one who does not care  
The cards of fate  
  
The older shows  
To the younger one, who dares to take  
The chance of no return  
  
Where have you been?  
Where are you going to?  
I want to know what is new  
I want to go with you  
  
What have you seen?  
What do you know that is new?  
Where are you going to?  
Because I want to go with you  
  
So meet me down at the Blue Cafe  
  
The cost is great, the price is high  
Take all you know, and say goodbye  
Your innocence, inexperience  
Mean nothing now  
  
Because, this is where the one who knows  
Meets the one that does not care  
Where have you been?  
I hear you say  
I'll meet you at the Blue Cafe  
  
So meet me at the Blue Cafe

Time to get up  
Make a move  
Put the brain in gear  
Cut the groove  
Moving slow  
With a smiling face  
Never look like you want it  
'Til it's right in your face  
  
I'm the hustler  
Playing my favorite game  
Yeah I'm the hustler  
Everybody knows my name  
  
Well I can get all around you  
While I think you stand still  
The way you tell me you won't  
Let's me know that you will  
Last thing you tell them  
Is what you came here for  
They're never going to find out  
'Til you way out the door  
'cause I'm the hustler  
Playing my favorite game  
Yeah I'm the hustler  
Everybody knows my name  
  
You got to love the work you do  
How long it takes  
Ain't important to you  
Don't care what's in it  
Loving every minute  
Every minute, every hour  
Every second of the day  
Little by little  
I see it coming my way  
  
I'm the hustler  
Playing my favorite game  
Yeah I'm the hustler  
Everybody knows my name

I love the sun  
I love the sea  
I'd like to think that you  
Were here with me  
  
But people are seasons  
And seasons change  
I'd like to think that you  
Are still the same  
  
Sometimes you made me happy  
Sometimes you made me cry  
But the memory of a good friend  
Never dies  
  
Between the lines  
Of an aging face  
Something special that you can't replace  
  
But people are seasons  
And seasons change  
I'd like to think that you  
Are still the same  
  
Sometimes you made me happy  
Sometimes you made me cry  
But the memory of a good friend  
Never dies  
  
And I see you standing  
By the harbor wall  
And I see you waving  
From the aeroplane  
Two hearts together  
Laughing in the rain

Time goes by and every single tear  
It must have well run dry  
And the lonely nights  
Become a strange accepted way  
  
And the years go past  
Just like the old song says  
The pain with time has healed, it couldn't last  
But oh a friend like a fool  
Mentions your name  
  
Sunny days, drunken nights  
You smile and say, it's alright  
But oh the cold cold rain  
At the mention of your name  
  
Forgive me please  
If I shrug my shoulders  
When I put my friend at ease  
As I get older  
  
It's not that I don't feel colder than before  
Oh I've become so good at hiding  
What I feel without confiding  
It's still the same, darling still the same  
At the mention of your name

Stood still on a highway I saw a woman by the side of the road  
With a face that I knew like my own  
Reflected in my window.  
Well she walked up to my quarter light and she bent down real slow  
A fearful pressure paralyzed me in my shadows.  
  
She said, Son  
What are you doing here?  
My fear for you has turned me in my grave.  
I said, Mama  
I come to the valley of the rich  
Myself to sell.  
She said, Son  
This is the road to hell.  
  
On your journey 'cross the wilderness from the desert to the well  
You have strayed upon the motorway to hell.
