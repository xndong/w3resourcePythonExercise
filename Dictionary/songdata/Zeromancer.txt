When you are gone  
  
It's the beginning of the end  
You know nothing last forever  
A beginning of a trend  
You need someone there to care for you  
It's the beginning of the end  
I don't think you understand  
Just a beginning of a flatline  
Together

Erotic saints  
Rated are  
Rainbow veins  
And sunlight scars  
Say my name  
Say my name  
  
Keep me dry  
In a cool place  
Get me out  
In a few days  
I will feel so much better  
  
Until we all are grown apart  
We live our lives the way we want  
Until we all are torn apart  
  
Been in for days  
Neon tan  
Asbestos lips  
Will kiss your hand  
Every word you say  
Blow me away  
  
This is it  
Here it comes  
I Think I'll quit  
To use my lungs  
Beta dreams  
Airbrush a tumor  
  
Until we all are torn apart  
Are torn apart

We are nothing but Eurotrash  
We take Plastic we take Cash  
We sell our hearts second class  
We slit our throats on tinted glass  
  
We are selling an image  
Everything must go  
I want you to know  
You don't want the side FX  
You want to .com  
New simulated sex  
We're selling you heaven  
Prices down to a low  
I thought you should know  
It's all in your head  
You're living a lie  
There is nothing  
Money can't buy  
  
We are nothing but Eurotrash  
We take Plastic we take Cash  
We sell our hearts second class  
We slit our throats on tinted glass  
  
We're silicon stitches  
Reality bites hard  
I want you to know  
It's all in your head  
You're living a lie  
There is nothing Money can't buy  
The future is here  
Dreams have no end  
Everything must go

You live your life day by day  
You can't feel it's slipping away  
It's like heaven where you never get bored  
You self inflicted Rock 'n roll whore  
  
Can you feel it  
Can you feel the clocks ticking away  
  
The world doesn't change in a day  
The world doesn't change it  
The world doesn't change in a day  
  
It makes me sick  
To see  
What you need  
To breathe  
It makes me sick  
To see  
What you need  
The world doesn't change in a day  
  
You've got a thousand wounds to heal  
You gotta stop thinking nothing's for real  
Electric shock won't bring you back  
You're fading baby  
You fade to black  
  
The world doesn't change in a day  
The world doesn't change it  
The world doesn't change in a day  
  
It makes me sick  
To see  
What you need  
To breathe  
It makes me sick  
To see  
What you need  
The world doesn't change in a day  
  
It makes me sick  
To see  
What you need  
To breathe  
It makes me sick  
To see  
What you mean  
To me  
  
When you are the one inside  
Is it what you thought it'd be  
I always knew you'd be a star  
And now you are

Kill your senses  
You might be right  
Hold your fire  
I'll take you higher  
Never drop  
We'll never stop  
  
Tar for feathers  
Blood for honey  
Milk for money  
Isn't it funny how it hurts  
How it hurts  
  
You never see me make  
The same mistake twice  
You never see a tear  
Coming out of these eyes  
You never see me beg  
For another shot  
And you never see me change  
Into something I'm not  
Famous last words  
  
Stare at someone  
You used to know  
Laughs at you  
Turns around and fade away  
If only I could see it that way  
  
Kill your senses  
It can't be right  
Isn't it funny how it hurts  
  
You never see me make  
The same mistake twice  
You never see a tear  
Coming out of these eyes  
You never see me quit  
See me disengage  
And you never see me spit in your face  
Out of rage  
Famous last words

Am I the queen up your sleeve  
When you got no ace  
Am I a slap in your face  
Am I the boy in your bed  
When you're feeling down  
Am I your living dead  
  
Would you die for me  
  
It doesn't have to be like this  
No!  
Feed you with a kiss  
Oh no!  
It doesn't have to be like this  
No!  
Feed you with a kiss  
  
Am I the queen up your sleeve  
When you got no ace  
Am I a slap in your face  
Am I a thought in your head  
That I keep away from you  
Cause it frightens me  
  
But you  
Gotta step away from it  
Step away from all of it  
Gotta step away from it  
Step away from all of this shit

Decoding every word you say  
When you hurt yourself  
There has to be a better way  
For you to hate yourself  
  
'Cause you don't understand  
What I'm trying to say to you  
You don't understand  
I am here to help you  
  
Flagellation Flagellation  
Take the pain of a modern nation  
Flagellation Flagellation  
Take the pain, take the violation  
  
It's gonna be allright  
  
I punish you for every kiss  
Look what you stole from me  
Blessing you for all your sins  
Hey you, you can never win  
  
If you don't understand  
What I'm trying to say to you  
You don't understand  
Anything at all  
  
Flagellation Flagellation  
Take the pain of a modern nation  
Flagellation Flagellation  
Take the pain, take the violation  
  
It's gonna be allright  
  
Right here  
Only pain's gonna set you free  
Right now  
You mean nothing to me  
  
Flagellation Flagellation  
Take the pain of a modern nation  
Flagellation Flagellation  
Take the pain, take the violation  
Flagellation Flagellation  
Come clean through the flagellation  
Flagellation Flagellation  
Take the pain, take the violation, yeah  
  
Everything's gonna be OK  
Everything's gonna be allright

You lost your self respect  
You gave it all away  
for no good reason  
what were you thinking  
  
Flirt with me  
If you want me to  
I'll do it for you  
  
When you got that  
smile on your face  
that look in yourt eye  
  
So look into these eyes  
and tell me what you see  
do you see affection  
the way it should be  
  
come on  
Flirt with me  
If you want me to  
I'll do it for you  
  
When you got that  
smile on your face  
that look in your eye  
you want everything  
  
I am the first you will ever have  
I am your lover  
I'm your God  
  
When I get close to you  
  
When you got that  
smile on your face  
that look in your eye  
you want everything

Some days are just a copy  
Of a day you had before  
You flash yourself thinking  
You can't take it anymore  
Never feels more alone  
When you're in a crowded room  
And bang your head to a wall  
You feel nothing, nothing at all  
  
Just want to feel the same  
Just want to feel the same  
  
Some things will never change  
Just want to feel the same  
Just want to feel the same  
  
Always knew you'd be a star  
Now I know that's what you are  
And we cry  
To a new beginning  
We deny  
A new beginning  
  
So let me introduce to you  
This favourite play of mine  
A comedy called Germany  
You may not understand  
The funny thing it's about someone  
Who's never been alone  
Just trying to be a friend  
So you can start all over again  
  
Some things will never change  
Just want to feel the same  
Just want to feel the same  
  
Always knew you'd be a star  
Now I know that's what you are  
And we cry  
To a new beginning  
We deny  
A new beginning

Love love love  
Makes you blind blind  
Lies lies lies  
Tear you down  
  
Plenty of time when you're dead  
To be the perfect girl  
There's plenty of room in your bed  
To make a perfect world  
  
Out of a fucked up head  
Comes a perfect girl  
Out of a fucked up head  
One perfect world  
  
I want to fall a million floors  
I'm gonna breathe through open pores  
I'm gonna scream out open doors  
God bless the models  
  
Time time time  
Makes you learn learn  
That love love love  
You will have to earn  
  
Out of a fucked up head  
Comes a perfect word  
Out of a fucked up head  
Comes a perfect world  
  
I want to fall a million floors  
I'm gonna scream through open doors  
You'll make the headlines when you die  
God bless the models  
  
Out of a fucked up head  
Comes a world of lust and greed  
Out of a fucked up head  
Comes a life of luxury  
  
I'm gonna be there when you die  
Don't cry  
Cause God bless  
The slave slave slave to fashion

It's on your mind but you can't say it  
It's in your eyes but you can't see it  
It's on your wrist but you can't time it  
It's off the top of your head but you can't wear it  
It's in your face, it's in your hands  
It's in the air but you can't breath it  
You're not the one I used to know  
Gone to your head  
It's up your nose but you can't snort it  
It's down your throat but you can't suck it  
It's in your lap but you can't have it  
It's in your reach but you can't grab it  
And what if I said it's in your head  
You're not the one I used to know  
And what if I said it's in your head  
You're not the one I used to know  
Gone to your head  

It's the real thing  
Safety's off  
Are you there  
Are you there for me  
By my side  
An angel  
Who dodge the bullets wide  
  
It feels right  
On a beach  
When you talk  
You talk without a sound  
And when you walk  
Your feet hardly touch the ground  
  
But you're there  
By my side  
But you're there for me  
  
When all this is over  
Heaven knows I'm going nowhere  
I was only dreaming  
Censored for a deeper meaning  
  
It wears off  
Like lipstick on your skin  
Like a day that won't begin  
Waking up  
And you can't remember  
Where you've been  
  
It's time  
We get things straight  
Are you there  
Are you there for me  
Back for good  
It's 6 a.m. in Hollywood

How can you stand there and deny it?  
After all we have been through  
How can you stand there and deny it?  
And make a fool out of you  
  
Collapsing  
Like houses of cards  
And landing  
On splinters and glass  
  
Wish I could fake it like you do  
Wish I could fake it just like you  
  
How can you stand there and deny it?  
How can you stand there and deny it?  
  
Trust me now  
  
Collapsing  
Like houses of cards  
And landing  
On splinters and glass  
  
They crush your heart  
But spare your feet  
Like judging people  
You've yet to meet  
Well time is running fast  
Upon your reflection  
  
Trust me now  
  
How can you stand there  
Stand and deny it?

It's the words you don't say  
That keeps ringing in my ear  
I feel like an idiot  
To think that you really cared  
It's the kiss you don't blow  
that I keep brushing off my chin  
It's the punch you don't throw  
That keeps hurting within  
I only loved you  
  
Whatever you do  
Whatever you say  
  
It's the words you don't scream  
That being sucked back in  
A dream within a dream  
It's not what you've seen  
It's what you don't understand  
That makes you sharper than  
The ones who  
Take advantage of you  
I only loved you  
  
Sick of this music  
  
Whatever you do  
Whatever you say  
A cellular goodbye

It's my life  
Yeah I know  
It's not a perfect one, but  
It's a life  
I can live with  
  
But you don't know  
If you can  
And you don't know  
If you want  
Cause you don't know  
If I'm the right one  
And you don't know  
Well let me tell you  
  
There's  
Something inside  
That's freaking me out  
Please don't  
Leave me alone  
Something inside me  
Is wearing me out  
Please don't  
Don't do it again  
  
Just like a fly  
On a jar  
Twinkle, twinkle little star  
You don't feel like you belong here  
But it's your life  
Even though  
It's not perfect  
It's a life you can live with

It's looking out  
From inside  
A Christmas bonus  
To last forever  
You think you're ready don't you  
  
It's a Mosquito Coil  
Where boys and girls  
Trying to stop their heads spinning  
A Mosquito Coil  
An instant supernova  
For beginners  
  
Once you're in  
You can't get out  
Dashboard Jesus  
Has your number  
And please remember me  
In your circle of friends  
  
What's killing you  
Is killing me  
One fling leads to another

You've got a halo hanging over your head  
Nothing can touch you  
Nothing can hurt you  
  
You take the world out of my eyes  
You suck the words out of my mouth  
When we kiss  
  
Need you like a drug  
Need you like a drug  
Can't make it stop  
Keep fucking it up  
Need you like a drug  
  
Don't ever want to be like you  
You have your friends calling you to say  
That nothing can touch you  
Nothing can hurt you  
Nothing can take your fantasy away  
Nothing can touch you  
Nothing can hurt you  
When we kiss  
  
It stings like a needle in me

I see you out on the dance floor shaking around  
I see you out on an empty beach  
I see you walking a one way street  
It's the same as always  
A star maybe you are  
A star maybe you are  
A new Madonna  
In a way I can hear myself say  
What is it worth  
I say we meet on the last place on earth  
It's insane as always  
Maybe you are  
A star maybe you are  
A new Madonna  
Is this the only way  
You make it like a new Madonna  

Sit down and watch me  
I want you to see me  
As your TV  
As your TV  
As your TV  
As your TV  
  
Touched by your static  
You see right  
Right through me  
As your TV  
As your TV  
As your TV  
As your TV  
  
What you hide is what you are  
Have what it takes to be a star  
Come on  
You say there's beauty in a scar  
Now what a stupid thing you are  
Sometimes  
  
After you get what you want  
You don't want it anymore  
Is that what you want?  
  
Slow down  
Zoom in  
Rewind  
Do you get the picture  
  
Philharmonic  
Philharmonic  
  
What you hide is what you are  
Have what it takes to be a star  
Come on  
You say there's beauty in a scar  
Now what a stupid thing you are  
Sometimes  
  
Philharmonic  
After you get what you want  
You don't want it anymore  
  
Philharmonic  
  
What you hide is what you are  
Have what it takes to be a star  
Come on  
You say there's beauty in a scar  
Now what a stupid thing you are  
Sometimes  
  
Philharmonic

Eat my self  
From a silverspoon  
Think I need some of that  
Breathing room  
Do you hear  
The ringing in my ear  
Am I the only one  
Who can make myself  
Disappear  
  
Plasmatic  
What is wrong when your  
Ego is a rose in bloom  
Plasmatic  
All I know is my  
Ego is a room without a view  
  
Fed up of repeating myself  
You are looking for something I haven't got  
Fed ex dreams when things are too slow  
Only let you know what you need to know  
  
Plasmatic  
What is wrong when your  
Ego is a rose in bloom  
Plasmatic  
All I know is my  
Ego is a room without a view  
  
Now, now, now is the time, time, time  
Now, now, now is the time, time, time  
For you and me  
Now, now, now is the time, time, time  
Now, now, now is the time, time, time  
For you and me  
Now, now, now is the time, time, time  
Now, now, now is the time, time, time

What is wrong when your  
Ego is a rose in bloom

All I know is my  
Ego is a room without a view

A new life  
Is abused  
Being bored  
And ignored  
So fucking what  
  
A new life  
Is abused  
Being bored  
And ignored  
So fucking what  
So fucking what  
So fucking what  
So fucking what

Do you believe in heaven above  
Do you believe in love  
Don't tell me a lie  
Don't be false or untrue  
It all comes back to you  
  
Open fire on my burning heart  
I've never been lucky in love  
My defences are down  
A kiss or a frown  
I can't survive on my own  
  
If a girl walks in  
And carves her name in my heart  
I'll turn and run away  
Everyday we've all been led astray  
It's hard to be lucky in love  
  
It gets in your eyes  
It's making you cry  
Don't know what to do  
Don't know what to do  
Looking for love  
Calling heaven above  
  
Send me an angel  
Send me an angel  
Right now  
Right now  
  
Send me an angel  
Send me an angel  
Right now  
Right now  
  
Empty dreams can only disappoint  
In a room behind your smile  
But don't give up, don't give up  
You can be lucky in love  
  
It gets in your eyes  
It's making you cry  
Don't know what to do  
Don't know what to do  
Looking for love  
Calling heaven above  
  
Send me an angel  
Send me an angel  
Right now  
Right now  
  
Send me an angel  
Send me an angel  
Right now  
Right now  
  
It gets in your eyes  
It's making you cry  
Don't know what to do  
Don't know what to do  
  
Send me an angel  
Send me an angel  
Right now  
Right now  
  
Send me an angel  
Send me an angel  
Right now  
Right now  
  
Send me an angel  
Right now  
Right now

Something for the pain  
Inside me  
That will never die  
The pain inside me  
That will never die  
  
My heart bleeds  
Look at you  
Hiding  
All the things  
To endure me  
  
I need you  
Here with me  
Breathing  
Wanting you  
To believe me  
  
Something for the pain  
Inside me  
That will never die  
The pain inside me  
That will never die  
  
I see you  
In all of these faces  
Blush with shame  
When I think of you  
  
And your pale skin  
I sell my soul for you  
  
Hush Hush  
Never enough  
Never enough  
  
The pain inside me  
That will never die  
Something for the pain  
Inside me  
That will never die

Stop the noise!  
Stop the noise, man!  
  
Burns like hell  
Melt in your mouth  
Twist and turn you  
Into something else  
  
Pinch yourself  
Taste so sweet  
Twist and turn you  
Into something cheap  
  
And all you want to do now  
Yeah Yeah  
And all you want to do now  
  
Stop the noise!  
You gotta stop the noise, man!  
Only in America  
Stop the noise!  
What you see can not be yours  
You gotta stop the noise, man!  
Only in America  
  
Breathing hurts  
Swallowing words  
It can't  
It can't get much worse  
  
Bleed you dry  
Against your will  
Think you're running  
But you're standing still  
  
It's all you want to do now  
Yeah Yeah  
It's all you want to do now  
  
Stop the noise!  
You gotta stop the noise, man!  
Only in America  
Stop the noise!  
What you see can not be yours  
You gotta stop the noise, man!  
Only if you  
Make it go away

Guys are drooling over you  
Sampling your soul  
You could be the chosen one, but what if  
Everything they say is wrong  
And you die some  
  
Everlasting teenage recoil  
Fall in love with anything, come undone  
With hearts unbroken  
And wish upon a lucky star  
  
Sometimes you feel so skinny  
It's like you don't even exist  
Lolita never been kissed  
You gotta feel what can be felt  
  
Touch what can be touched  
Do what can be done  
But don't die young  
Against all odds again  
You got zip to lose

Wannabe, yeah you  
You're just a wannabe  
Do you want to be like me  
  
Dumb dumb dummy dumb dumb dumb  
Dumb dumb dummy dumb dumb dumb  
Dumb dumb dummy dumb dumb dumb  
Dumb dumb dummy dumb dumb dumb  
  
Feels like a hole inside  
Can't breathe my lungs have dried  
My heart's a bomb  
Ready to go off  
  
A wannabe, that's you  
A fucking wannabe  
Why do you want to be like me  
  
You hate yourself  
But rate yourself  
As a number one  
  
You hate yourself  
But rate yourself  
As a number one  
  
Feels like a hole inside  
Can't breathe my lungs have dried  
My heart's a bomb  
Ready to explode  
  
Brings out the prick in me  
Don't think it's purity  
I stick in you  
Try to tell yourself  
It ain't true  
  
Dumb dumb dummy dumb dumb dumb  
Dumb dumb dummy dumb dumb dumb  
  
You hate yourself, but rate yourself  
Dumb dumb dummy dumb dumb dumb  
Dumb dumb dummy dumb dumb dumb  
  
You hate yourself, but rate yourself  
Dumb dumb dummy dumb dumb dumb  
Dumb dumb dummy dumb dumb dumb
